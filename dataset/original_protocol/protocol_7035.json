    "Bacterial Culture inoculation with duloxetineInoculate Clostridium saccharolyticum from stock culture (20% glycerol in mGAM medium, stored at -80°C) in 5 ml mGAM and allow it to grow overnight. Then passage it to 5 ml GMM (gut microbiota medium) and grow overnight to get the preculture. Use the preculture to inoculate the 96 deep well plate (total volume between 100 and 800 µl depending on the plate size). Measure the inoculation OD (should be at ~0.01).Grow the culture plate for 48 h and measure OD (should be between 0.8 to 1).Prepare drug containing medium (GMM) at a 2× concentration (100 µM duloxetine). Prepare the medium containing the bacterial species (Clostridium saccharolyticum) also with 2× inoculum from Step A2 (OD for 2× is 0.02). Mix the final medium according to the different sample requirements, e.g., 1× drug plus 1× bacteria (in this case, a mixture of 50 µl of 2× drug in GMM and 50 µl of 2× bacteria). The final concentration is then 1× bacteria and 1× drug.Grow the culture plate for 48 h at 37°C in a vinyl anaerobic chambers type C, in a nitrogen atmosphere containing 12% CO2 and 1% hydrogen (anoxic).Sample preparation for drug extractionAfter 48 h of incubation, remove the culture plates from the anaerobic chamber and transfer 10 μl aliquots of ‘total’ culture (medium + bacteria) to a new 96-well plate. Spin down the remaining culture at 4,000 × g for 10 min to harvest the supernatant. Aliquot 10 μl of ‘supernatant’ in another 96-well plate.Add 1 ml of cold (-20°C) extraction solvent (see Recipes) to 10 μl aliquots of both total and supernatant samples and vortex for 5 min (100-fold dilution) in the culture plates (deep 96-well plates).",
    "Then, further dilute 25 μl with 500 μl of extraction solvent (2,000-fold dilution) in polypropylene deep 96-well plates.Close the plates with a lid, incubate for 15 min at -20°C, and centrifuge at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.Remove 100 μl of extracted supernatant from the above plate and transfer to WebSeal 96-well plate for LC–MS analysis.Standard calibration curve and Quality Control (QC) sample preparationPrepare 1 μM stock of duloxetine and internal standards in DMSO (see Recipes).Serially dilute duloxetine stock to prepare the following calibration using 2× dilutions at each level in extraction solvent.Standard solutions in ‘total culture’: incubate drug concentrations of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 70 μM in a bacterial culture. Add 1 ml of cold extraction solvent in the total culture inoculate of each concentration level separately. Prepare these standards in the same manner as actual experimental conditions for samples (as mentioned in Step B3 of Sample preparation for extraction of drugs).Standard solutions in ‘supernatant’: prepare supernatant standard solutions from above ‘total culture’ by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Add 1 ml of cold extraction solvent in the supernatant of each concentration level separately. Prepare these standards in the same manner as the actual experimental conditions for samples (as mentioned in Step B3 of Sample preparation for extraction of drugs). Refer to Figure 1 for an overview of sample preparation.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4214/bioprotoc-11-21-4214-g001.jpgFigure 1. Overall workflow for sample preparation for LC–HRMS analysis. For a description of total culture, refer to Procedure A.Prepare QC sample at 40 μM of duloxetine separately for ‘total culture’ and ‘supernatant’ as mentioned above in Steps C3 and C4.LC–MS/MS analysisPreparation of mobile phases:For buffer solvent A and B preparations, see Recipes.",
    "Mix each buffer solvents thoroughly by shaking and degas both the buffers in the water bath sonicator with loose caps for at least 10 min.Set the flow rate of 0.3 ml/min.Maintain the column at 40°C.Set LC gradient for 10 min as follows: start at 10% of solvent B for 2 min, ramp up to 90% for 2 min, and hold for 2 min; next, allow 4 min of equilibration to the initial condition (10% of solvent B).Vanquish UHPLC–MS/MS system preparationPut up both mobile phase buffers on the UHPLC system and purge it with the mobile phase buffers for 5 min.Set up the UPLC column and start the flow at a rate of 0.3 ml/min with both mobile phase buffers at a ratio of 90:10 (A:B).Equilibrate the column for at least 15 min after the column pressure is stable.MS parameter preparation and Q-exactive plus HRMS calibrationUse extended mass calibration solution and perform ‘custom calibration’ for the mass spec with Xcalibur tune software.Set the tune MS parameters to the ESI positive mode as shown in Table 1:Table 1.
