We note that in the absence of NP-Ficoll, minimal plasma cell and CSR responses are observed. The amount of NP-Ficoll is absolutely critical as it displays a biphasic response, where plasma cell differentiation is inhibited at higher concentrations despite not inhibiting proliferation. Within a critical window, increasing the amount of NP-Ficoll alters the strength of BCR signaling and influences the efficiency of plasma cell differentiation as well as CSR (Ochiai et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]; Sciammas et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]). Any valency of NP-Ficoll can be used; however, due to their effects on BCR signal strength, each exhibit different dose response relationships to B cell differentiation and thus require titration (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) (Ochiai et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]; Sciammas et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]). The concentration of NP-Ficoll can be determined using RT-PCR and flow cytometry; the genetic event related to CSR is observed at around 24–60 h using RT-PCR. CD138+ plasma cells with/without class switched IgG1+ can be detected from 72 h using flow cytometry. It is recommended to examine the frequency of CD138+ cells with/without IgG1+ by titrating NP-Ficoll in a first experiment. Then, using the selected concentration of NP-Ficoll, the genetic event will be confirmed.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/761-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Each transcript was normalized by β-2 microglobulin.\n(C) Oligo sequences which can detect γ1 germline or postswitch transcripts using real-time PCR.\nNote: We have found that the amount of NP-Ficoll used differs when analyzing B1-8i versus B1-8hi in vitro responses (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nNote: To perform RT-PCR, you require additional days for RNA purification, cDNA synthesis, and PCR analysis.\nPerform negative enrichment of splenic B cells via magnetic separation according to manufacturer’s protocol. (https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/b-cell-isolation-kit-mouse.html#130-090-862[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/b-cell-isolation-kit-mouse.html#130-090-862])\nHomogenize mouse spleen in 2–3 mL of Red Blood Cell Lysis Buffer, wash with 2–3 mL of MACS buffer, and transfer to 15 mL centrifugation tube.\nCentrifuge (300 xg, 4°C, 5 min) and resuspend in 5–10 mL of MACS buffer.\nAfter magnetic separation, collect unbound cells according to the manufacturer’s protocol. (https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/JP-en/products/ls-columns.html#130-042-401[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/JP-en/products/ls-columns.html#130-042-401])\nCount cells.\nNote: Keep about 1×106 before adding antibody cocktail of the B cell isolation kit, and compare with sorted cells for the enrichment of B220 positivity. It is expected to achieve ∼95% enrichment purity.\nIncubate with 10 μL of diluted antibody in FACS buffer. Anti-B220 is diluted 1 in 100, and blocking Fc receptors (anti-CD16/CD32) is not necessary.\nWash unbound antibody with 1 mL FACS buffer: Centrifuge (300 xg, 5 min) and remove supernatant.\nPrepare culture medium supplemented with cytokines/stimulators (excluding NP-Ficoll).\nPlate cells in culture dish at 0.5 × 106 cells/cm2 in a volume of 0.5–1.0 × 106 cell/mL).\nNote: When we examine the condition of cell differentiation efficiency, we normally use a 24 well plate with round bottom, 1 mL/well culture.\nAdd NP-Ficoll at empirically derived amount.",
    "Important: In our hands, a final concentration of 0.01 ng/mL is effective for maximal PC differentiation whereas a 100 fold less for maximal CSR (Sciammas et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]). For PC, a useful range is 0.001–0.1 ng/mL with a valency of ∼10 moles of NP to 1 mole of Ficoll or about 10–50 fold less when using a valency of ∼100 moles of NP to mole of Ficoll. In contrast, for maximal CSR, use 100–1,000 fold less NP-Ficoll.\nCulture for up to 96 h (4 days) before analysis.\nImportant: The onset of CSR and PC differentiation is around 48 h (day 2) and peak generation is 96 h (day 4). Prominent cell death is observed after day 4.\nExamine the frequency of IgG1+ and/or CD138+ cells by flow cytometry (preferred).\nWash 1–2 × 106 cells with 1 mL FACS buffer: Centrifuge (300 xg, 5 min) and remove supernatant.\nNote: Blocking Fc receptors (anti-CD16/CD32) is not necessary.\nIncubated with 10 μL of diluted antibody in FACS buffer.\nNote: Anti-CD138 is diluted 1 in 30 and anti-IgG1 is diluted 1 in 100.\nIncubate (at least 30 min and up to 2 h).\nWash unbound antibody with 1 mL FACS buffer: Centrifuge (300 xg, 5 min) and remove supernatant.\nOptional: Dead cells are excluded using a viability dye such as DAPI, PI, or 7-AAD.\nNote: In our hands, with the higher dose of NP-Ficoll, PC frequencies, as determined by anti-CD138 staining, were in the range of 50% of live cells. Similarly, at the lower dose of NP-Ficoll, frequencies of cells expressing surface IgG1 were 20%.",
    "Note: Alternatively, analyzing the expression of key genes including those for Blimp-1 and Irf4 (PC) or Aicda and germline IgG1 transcripts (CSR) over the 4 day time course can help determine the suitable NP-Ficoll concentration (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C). Genes examined for their expression in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B are described in below.\nInducers of Aicda expression Pax5; transcription factor which maintains B cell identify, and activates Aicda expression (Gonda et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Nera et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]). Batf; transcription factor which activates Aicda expression collaborating with IRF4 (Ise et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; Ochiai et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]).\nCSR related genes Aicda; encodes AID, an essential enzyme for CSR (Chaudhuri et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Muramatsu et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). γ1 germline; γ1 transcripts prior to CSR, detected using γ1-forward and reverse primers (Muramatsu et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). γ1 postswitch; γ1 transcripts after CSR, detected using Igm-forward and γ1-reverse primers (Sciammas et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]). Igm; transcripts of μ, detected using Igm-forward and reverse primers (Muramatsu et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]).\nPromoters of plasma cell differentiation IRF4; transcription factor required for both CSR and PC. Activates Prdm1 expression (Gonda et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Sciammas et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]). Blimp-1; a master regulator of PC, encoded by Prdm1. Activates Irf4 expression (Minnich et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]; Shapiro-Shelef et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28]).\nPurification of endogenous protein complex from activated B cells\nTiming: 3–4 days",
    "Prior to designing the complex purification, it is necessary to prepare the specific antibodies against a target protein. The efficiency of immunoprecipitation (IP) protein purification is directly influenced by the quality of antibody and a key factor in the success of endogenous protein purification is the antibody conjugation. The contamination of immunoglobulin (Ig) in mass spectrometry samples strongly interferes with the detection of peptides, which can be minimized in the Ab conjugation step. In addition, it is important to prepare enough cells for IP. Mouse splenic B cells are much smaller than cells from other tissues and therefore result in low protein yields. To obtain detectable signals for mass spectrometry, we normally start with 1 × 108 cells per IP reaction; this requires purification of B cells pooled from multiple B1-8 mice as the typical yield from one mouse is 2–4 × 107. In our experience, it is expected to obtain 1 × 108 splenic B cells from about 4 mice. Upon stimulation, cell number does not alter at 24 h, but it becomes about double at 72 h. Although we normally do not sort cells after stimulation further, you may sort with specific surface markers. In that case, you will need increased number of cells for complex purification.",
    "Finally, the specificity of IP samples must be evaluated in LC-MS/MS, ideally with target-deficient B cells as a control. However, in cases where the target proteins are critical for cell survival, it is difficult to do so. In our previous analyses, we purified the IRF4 complex (Ochiai et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]) and the PC4 complex (Ochiai et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]) from B1-8hi B cells stimulated for 72 h. Both IRF4 and PC4 are necessary for cell survival and/or plasma cell differentiation upon B cell activation. Therefore, we utilized an IgG IP as the control for αIRF4 and αPC4 IP.\nAntibody (Ab) adsorption and conjugation to protein A/G dynabeads It is recommended to prepare the antibody-conjugated beads the day before.\nNote: Take care to determine whether the antibody species and/or isotype is compatible with protein A/G dynabeads. Use magnetic field to separate supernatant and beads.\nProtocol using 5 μg antibodies; sufficient for 1×108 cells/IP.\nTransfer 50 μL dynabeads into 1.5 mL tube.\nWash dynabeads twice with cold PBS.\nResuspend the beads to the manufacturer-prepared original 1:1 slurry concentration in PBS, typically, 50 μL. (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/10001D[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/10001D]) (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/10003D#/10003D[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/10003D#/10003D])\nCombine antibodies with protein A or G dynabeads supplemented with NaCl.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_761_27.csv\nRotate (20°C–25°C, 1 h).\nRemove supernatant.\nWash beads in 10 bead volumes of 0.2 M Sodium borate (pH 9.0), typically 500 μL.\nRemove supernatant.\nResuspend in 10 bead volumes of 0.2 M Sodium borate, typically 500 μL.\nCrosslink with Dimethyl pimelimidate dihydrochloride at a final concentration of 20 mM from a stock concentration of 0.2 M dimethyl pimelimidate dihydrochloride in 0.2 M sodium borate.\nRotate (20°C–25°C, 30 min).\nRemove supernatant.\nStop reaction by diluting with 10 volumes of 0.1 M Tris (pH 8.0), typically 500 μL.\nRemove supernatant.\nResuspend in 10 volumes of 0.1 M Tris (pH 8.0), typically 500 μL.",
    "Incubate (20°C–25°C, more than two hours)\nNote: It is recommended to incubate for 12–15 h.\nWash with 10 volumes of PBS, and remove supernatant.\nResuspend Ab-conjugated beads in PBS as a 50:50 slurry; typically 50 μL.\nStore at 4°C (use within a few days).\nNote: Retain 2 μL at each step to confirm conjugation by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B).\nReCLIP (Reverse Cross-Link Immuno-Precipitation) using whole cell extracts\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/761-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Antibody coupling used for endogenous IP\n(A) The workflow of antibody conjugation. Collected samples, (1) to (3), are examined in B.\n(B) Evaluation of antibody coupling. Load collected samples (1) to (3) on a SDS-PAGE gel, followed by coomassie staining. Bands observed around 27 kDa and 50 kDa are immunoglobulin (Ig) light and heavy chains, respectively. (1) Before conjugation: Ig bands were detected. (2) After conjugation: Ig bands have disappeared. (3) Flow through: non-specific bands were observed around 25 kDa and 75 kDa with flow through of αIRF4 antibodies conjugation.\nThis method is modified from (Smith et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib30]). Cells are treated with reversible crosslinkers, DTME and DSP, which stabilize normally labile or dynamic molecular interactions. In the original protocol, target protein and interacting proteins were separated by reverse cross-linking using 1 × RIPA supplemented with 50 mM DTT. Our protocol modified this separation step, and eluted both target protein and interacting proteins (see step t. Elution). Therefore, the IP efficiency can be determined using immunoblot prior to LC-MS/MS (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/761-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

To detect IP samples in IB, the TrueBlot series (Rockland) reduced detection of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains. (Right) Table indicates the details of IP procedure and sample amounts loaded for immunoblot analysis.\nProtocol using 2×108 cells, which are divided into two samples (IgG and target protein) at step p.\nWash cells three times: suspend in 40 mL PBS and centrifuge (300 xg, 20°C–25°C, 5 min).\nResuspend pellet in 5 mL PBS.\nAdd 5 mL of 2 × Cross link buffer and mix gently.\nIncubate in water bath with mild shaking (20°C–25°C, 30 min).\nCentrifuge (1,710 xg, 20°C–25°C, 5 min) and remove supernatant.\nResuspend in 5 mL of ReCLIP quench buffer.\nIncubate in water bath with mild shaking (20°C–25°C, 5 min).\nCentrifuge (1,710 xg, 20°C–25°C, 5 min) and remove supernatant.\nResuspend with ice-cold PBS and centrifuge (1,710 xg, 4°C, 5 min).\nRemove supernatant and add 1 mL of RIPA buffer, and transfer to 1.5 mL tube.\nIncubate on ice for 10 min.\nSonicate using a Bioruptor: 10 cycles of 30 s ON and 30 s OFF.\nCentrifuge (17,800 xg, 4°C, 10 min) and transfer supernatant into new 1.5 mL tube.\nIncubate lysate with 100 μL unconjugated protein A/G dynabeads (4°C, 1 h).\nNote: This step removes bead-only reactive material from the lysate. Sample is divided at the next step, and use equal volume as total Ab conjugated beads. For example, if you divide into two tubes to perform IP using 50 μL of conjugated control IgG or 50 μL of target protein in each tube, use 100 μL of uncojugated beads for this step.",
    "Apply magnetic field to the tubes in order to magnetically trap the beads; transfer supernatant to a new 1.5 mL tube. Important: At this step, retain 1/10 volume to use as an input control, typically 50 μL.\nDivide sample equally into two 1.5 mL tubes, typically less than 500 μL/tube.\nAdd 50 μL of conjugated beads into each 1.5 mL tube. Tube 1; Control IgG-conjugated beads Tube 2; Target protein-specific Ab-conjugated beads\nRotate (4°C, at least 2 h).\nNote: If necessary, incubation can be extended to 12–15 hours.\nWash with 500 μL of 1× RIPA buffer at least twice.\nElution\nAdd 10 μL of elution buffer.\nIncubate at 37°C for 20 min, then 70°C for 10 min.\nInsert into the magnetic field to trap beads and retain the supernatant.\nTransfer the supernatant into a new 1.5 mL tube.\nAdd 10 μL of 2 × SDS sample buffer (Final volume; 20 μL).\nNote: If you prefer to prepare highly-dense immunopreciptated samples, you may use a higher concentration of SDS sample buffer, such as 5 × SDS sample buffer, to reduce the final volume.\nChIP (Chromatin-immunoprecipitation) of nuclear extracts This method is modified from standard ChIP assays, using formaldehyde as a crosslinker. It could be useful if ReCLIP is not suitable to analyze chromatin-related proteins. In our case, we purified the PC4 complex using this method. PC4 regulates chromatin compaction by interacting with linker histones and heterochromatin proteins (Das et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Das et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).",
    "Note: Compared with ReCLIP, the higher number of cells might be required to obtain the protein complex using sample amount of conjugated beads. For example, we carried out PC4 IP with around 6–10 × 108 cells using this method, whereas we carried out IRF4 IP with around 1 × 108 cells using ReCLIP. It should be noted that cell number required for IP is also affected by other factors, such protein expression level and antibody efficiency for IP.\nSuspend cells in culture medium at 4 × 106 cells/mL.\nAdd 1/10 volume of 10 × crosslink buffer (final concentration of 1×) and mix gently.\nIncubate (20°C–25°C, 10 min).\nQuench with 1/20 volume of 2.5 M Glycine.\nIncubate (20°C–25°C, 5 min).\nAdd >2 volumes of ice-cold PBS.\nCentrifuge (1,710 xg, 4°C, 5 min) and remove supernatant.\nAdd ice-cold PBS as in step f.\nCentrifuge (1,710 xg, 4°C, 5 min) and remove supernatant.\nResuspend in Lysis buffer at 20 × 106 cells/mL.\nIncubate on ice for 10 min.\nCentrifuge (1,710 xg, 4°C, 5 min) and remove supernatant.\nResuspend in Nuclear Lysis buffer at 20 × 106 cells/mL, and divide lysate into 300 μL volumes in 1.5 mL t tubes.\nIncubate (20°C–25°C, 10 min).\nNote: This step dissolves nuclear membrane and increases the sonication efficiency. After incubation, keep sample tubes at 4°C. To avoid SDS crystal precipitation, put sample tubes on a plastic eppen stand which is kept on ice.\nSonicate using a Bioruptor: 10 cycles of 30 s ON and 30 s OFF.\nNote: Sonication conditions may vary depending on cell type; these have been optimized for in vitro activated B cells.\nCentrifuge (17,800 xg, 4°C, 15 min) and transfer supernatant into a new 1.5 mL tube. Important: At this step, retain 1/10 volume to use as an input control.",
    "Dilute with 4 volumes of ChIP dilution buffer.\nIncubate lysate with 100 μL of unconjugated protein A/G dynabeads (4°C, 1 h).\nNote: Same as step 8.n.\nApply magnetic field to the tubes to magnetically trap the beads; transfer supernatant to a new tube and equally split into two 1.5 mL tubes.\nAdd 50 μL of conjugated beads into each 1.5 mL tube. Tube 1; Control IgG-conjugated beads Tube 2; Target protein-specific Ab-conjugated beads\nRotate (4°C, 2 h).\nWash with PBS or ChIP wash buffer three times, followed by two washes with TE, and elute as described in ReCLIP section (see step 8s).\nOptional: Elution using ChIP elution buffer (final 1% SDS, 100 mM NaHCO3) allows proceeding to ChIP qPCR or ChIP-seq, after reverse crosslinking and DNA purification.\nCheck the IP efficiency by immunoblot (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B).\nSample preparation for LC-MS/MS\nTiming: 2–3 days\nProtein identification by LC-MS/MS requires efficient digestion of proteins into peptides and removal of molecules such as detergents or salts which can damage LC columns or interfere with ionization in MS. Many methods to these ends have been published, each of which has pros and cons. We usually subject samples to SDS-PAGE followed by in-gel digestion. Although this method is time-consuming, it is easier and more consistent compared to other methods. In addition, SDS-PAGE serves for protein fractionation which can reduce protein complexity in an MS/MS run. See the workflow in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/761-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "(C) Outcomes of protein complex purification by mass spectrometry. These data have been reported in our previous reports; IRF4 complexes (Ochiai et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]), PC4 complexes (Ochiai et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]). Used antibodies: αIRF4 (Santa Cruz #sc-6067; no longer available), αPC4 (Abcam #84459). N.D.: not detected.\nProtein separation by SDS-PAGE The procedure is not particularly different from ordinary SDS-PAGE except that we must beware of contamination of human keratin. Electrophoresis apparatuses and running buffer should be clean.\nPrepare SDS-PAGE using a 5%–20% gradient polyacrylamide gel.\nApply the entire volume of samples and 1.5–2 μL of the protein marker in every other lane.\nCover the top of electrophoresis apparatus to avoid contamination of dust. Start electrophoresis at a constant voltage of 70–80 V.\nStop run when the electrophoresis front is 2–3 cm above the gel bottom.\nCBB (Coomassie Brilliant Blue) staining of the gel Other protocols will work, but heating or microwaving should be avoided.\nDisassemble the apparatus and remove the region of the gel below the electrophoresis front.\nPut the gel in a clean plastic container (with a cover), and rinse the gel briefly with Milli-Q water.\nFix the gel in the fixation solution with gentle shaking (30 min or longer).\nReplace the solution with Milli-Q water, and add 2–3 mL of CBB staining solution.\nShake the container gently until protein bands in the sample lanes become visible (20°C–25°C, 1–2 h or longer).\nNote: Staining is complete when two pink bands in the protein marker lane turn purple (Protein marker used: Precision Plus Protein™ Dual Color Standards from Bio-Rad). If staining looks insufficient, refresh water with staining solution.\nReplace the solution with Milli-Q water to reduce background staining.\nPause Point: The gel can be stored at 4°C at any step after fixation.\nCutting the gel",
    "Cut the entire lane of interest into gel pieces using a clean surgical knife.\nNote: It may be difficult when protein bands are faint. We usually scan a gel with a flatbed image scanner, enhance contrast in sample lanes in the image using a photo retouch software, draw vertical and horizontal lines to assist cutting off gel pieces, and print it out on an overhead projector sheet (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). The gel is superposed on the sheet laid on a tracing light box. Number of gel pieces from one lane depends on sample complexity, where four is probably the maximum to give a gel size that a microfuge tube can contain.\nMake many small scores in the gel pieces by sticking them with the knife.\nTransfer every gel piece into numbered 1.5- or 2-mL tubes.\nPause Point: Gel pieces can be stored at 4°C for at least a few days. For a longer storage, add 30% acetonitrile/0.1M ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) to suppress mold growth.\nDestaining and dehydration of the gel pieces\nAdd an appropriate volume of 30% acetonitrile (ACN)/0.1 M ABC to every tube.\nNote: The volume should be adjusted so that the gel is soaked in the solution. E.g., soak a gel completely with 300 μL 30% ACN, and add 30 μL 1M ABC.\nNote: Dilute 100% ACN with Milli-Q water to prepare 30% ACN.\nVortex or rotate the tubes until the gels are thoroughly destained.\nNote: For deeply stained gels, refresh the solution several times until the gel becomes colorless.\nReplace the solution with 50% ACN.\nDehydrate the samples by vortex or rotation (20°C–25°C, 5–10 min)\nRemove solution.\nRepeat dehydration in 100% ACN (20°C–25°C, 5–10 min)\nRemove solution.\nNote: the gel pieces should appear white.\nDry the gel pieces in a centrifugal vacuum concentration.",
    "Pause Point: Dried gel pieces can be stored at 4°C for more than a week.\nIn-gel reduction and alkylation of protein\nAdd an appropriate volume of Reduction solution to each tube; soak gels completely.\nIncubate the samples (56°C, 1 h).\nRemove Reduction solution.\nAdd Alkylation solution; soak gels completely.\nIncubate the samples with vortex or rotation (20°C–25°C, 45 min).\nRemove Alkylation solution\nAdd Milli-Q water; 0.5–1 mL.\nRinse the samples by vortex or rotation (20°C–25°C, 5–10 min).\nRefresh water and wash the gel pieces once more.\nDehydrate the samples in 0.5–1 mL 30% ACN (20°C–25°C, 5–10 min).\nRemove solution (Repeat h. once).\nNote: Increase count or length of step e-h for complete washing if necessary.\nDehydrate in 0.5–1 mL 50% ACN (20°C–25°C, 5–10 min)\nRemove solution.\nDehydrate in 0.5–1 mL 100% ACN (20°C–25°C, 5–10 min)\nRemove solution thoroughly.\nDry the gel pieces in a centrifugal vacuum concentration.\nPause Point: Dried gel pieces can be stored at 4°C for more than a week.\nIn-gel trypsin digestion\nChill the samples on ice.\nPrepare 1 ng/μL trypsin in ice-chilled Digestion buffer.\nAdd 10–30 μL of diluted trypsin to each sample.\nNote: Chilling the samples and solution are important to suppress trypsin activity before the enzyme enters the gel.\nKeep the tubes on ice (10-15 min).\nOptional: If necessary, repeat adding a small amount of Digestion buffer (without trypsin) until the gel pieces are fully reconstituted and their surfaces become wet.\nAfter the gel pieces are reconstituted, incubate the sample tubes on ice (more than an hour)\nTrypsin digestion: Place the sample tubes into an air incubator (37°C, 10–12 h).\nTryptic peptide extraction For each sample, peptides are recovered completely by extracting three times. Three extracts are combined, concentrated, and finally suspended in a small volume of 0.5% Formic acid solution.",
    "First extraction: Add 70% ACN to each tube, typically 100–300 μL.\nVortex or sonicate for 15–20 min.\nTransfer the extracts to new tubes and reduce the volume to 10–20 μL in a centrifugal vacuum concentration.\nSecond extraction: Add freshly prepared 75% ACN containing 1% Formic acid, typically 100–300 μL.\nVortex or sonicate for 15–20 min.\nNote: When the first extract is almost dried, transfer the second extract to the same tube and reduce the volume to 10–20 μL in a centrifugal vacuum concentration.\nThird extraction; Repeat above step d and e.\nCombine all three extracts, and reduce the volume to 10–20 μL in a centrifugal vacuum concentration.\nAdd 6 μL of 2.5% Formic acid, and vortex for 1–2 min.\nAdjust the volume to 30 μL by adding Milli-Q water and transfer the samples to 0.3-mL vials.\nPause Point: Samples can be stored at −30°C for at least a week.\nRun each sample on mass spectrometry to identify peptides."
