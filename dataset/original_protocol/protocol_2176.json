    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nCritical: Human umbilical cord samples must be obtained in compliance with institutional review board regulations and ethical guidelines. All procedures used for handling human tissues should assume potential contamination of tissue with human pathogens (HBV, HCV, HIV, C. difficile, etc.).\nDissection of Arteries from Human Umbilical Cord\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step details how to dissect the arteries from human umbilical cord (as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/178-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Method Detail\n(A) Human umbilical cords were obtained from St Michaels’ Maternity Hospital.\n(B) Arteries and vein were identified in umbilical cord cross-section.\n(C) The cord is partially pinned down to permit further dissection.\n(D) Arteries should be used immediately after dissection.\nObtain human umbilical cords, covered under existing ethical approval.\nStore umbilical cords in serum free media at 4°C immediately after being obtained.\nDissect umbilical cord samples, limiting the time between harvest and usage within the bioreactor setup to 90 ± 30 min.\nHuman umbilical cords contain two arteries and one vein surrounded by Wharton jelly.\nUnder sterile conditions, place a length of umbilical cord within a sylgard petri dish.\nIdentify the two arteries and one vein by observing a cross-section of the umbilical cord.\nPartially open the cord and pin down on the dish (a flat surface is required to work on).\nMicro-dissect the arteries under phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) containing penicillin 100 U/mL and streptomycin 100 mg/mL at 4°C and flush with PBS to remove any possible blood clots before transferring into serum free DMEM at 4°C\nUse the excised arteries immediately after the dissection to preserve vessel integrity and maintain experimental consistency.\nEx Vivo Model of Aneurysm\nTiming: 3 h\nThis step details how to set up the bioreactor system for the ex vivo aneurysm model",
    "Sterilize tissue culture hoods with a Milton sterilizing solution\nPlace bioreactor chambers in Milton sterilizing solution for at least 2 h, then briefly wash in sterile water and finally place under a tissue culture hood to dry.\nCut the arteries (stored in serum free DMEM at 4°C) into three equal lengths of 5 cm to be used for baseline, untreated, and treated conditions, respectively.\nConnect the short silicon tubes at both ends of the bioreactor chamber.\nMount the arteries between two small cannulae, using sutures to double tie the artery onto each cannula.\nConnect each cannula to the short silicon tube and then place inside a supporting bioreactor chamber.\nFill the long silicon tube with 10% FBS/DMEM and pass the tube through a peristaltic pump to close the system and permit the induction of laminar flow within an incubator.\nSubject each chamber to identical pulsatile flow conditions with a flow rate of 6.5 dyn/cm2 to closely mimic abdominal aortic in vivo conditions, at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 72 h.\nAs a control, use untreated chambers with 80 mL of 10% FBS/DMEM. For Ang II-treated arteries, supplement 80 mL of 10% FBS/DMEM with 5 μM Angiotensin II. For intervention-treated chambers, add 80 mL of 10% FBS/DMEM with the corresponding intervention.\nAfter 72 h of flow within the bioreactor chambers, carefully remove the arteries.\nRemove and dispose of the two edges of the artery (not subjected to a laminar flow) where they were sutured to the cannula. Cut the artery cut into two segments, to be named as proximal and distal.\nFix the proximal segment in 10% formalin and prepare for histology and store the distal segment in a −80°C freezer for downstream genomic/proteomic analysis.\nHistological Processing: Elastin van Gieson Staining\nTiming: 3 h 30 min",
    "The proximal portion of the artery (approx. 2.5 cm in length) should be cut into five 5 mm rings for subsequent histological processing and wax embedding.\nFrom the formalin-fixed wax-embedded arterial rings, cut 3 μm sections collected upon adhesive glass microscope slides (two sections per slide).\nTo enable assessment of arterial elastin content, perform Elastin van Gieson (EVG) histochemical staining using an automated stainer (such as a Shandon Varistain 24-4 Automatic Slide Stainer) or manual protocol (protocol details are shown in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_178_3.csv\nAfter EVG staining, coverslip sections using a relevant mounting medium (such as DPX) and visualize the sections using a bright field microscope and acquire images under ×20 magnification.\nDetermine the relative amount of elastin (which appears as black under a light microscope) using a computerized image analysis program (such as Image Pro Plus or ImageJ) and express as an average percentage of the arterial cross-sectional area.\nHistological Processing: Hematoxylin and Eosin Stain\nTiming: 1 h 30 min\nFrom the formalin-fixed wax-embedded arterial rings, cut 3 μm sections collected upon adhesive glass microscope slides (two sections per slide).\nTo enable assessment of arterial cellular content and general morphology, perform haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) histochemical staining using an automated stainer (such as a Shandon Varistain 24-4 Automatic Slide Stainer) or manual protocol (protocol details are shown in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_178_4.csv\nAfter H&E staining, coverslip sections using a relevant mounting medium (such as DPX) and visualize the sections using a bright field microscope and acquire images under ×20 magnification.\nCount the number of nuclei and express as an average percentage of the arterial cross-sectional area.\nHistological Processing: Picrosirius Red Staining\nTiming: 4 h\nFrom the formalin-fixed wax-embedded arterial rings, cut 3 μm sections collected upon adhesive glass microscope slides (two sections per slide).",
    "To enable assessment of arterial collagen content, perform picrosirius red (0.1% (w/v) Sirius Red F3B saturated aqueous picric acid, pH 1.8–2.2) histochemical staining (protocol details are shown in Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_178_5.csv\nAfter picrosirius red staining, coverslip sections using a relevant mounting medium (such as DPX) and visualize the sections using a bright field polarizing microscope and acquire images under ×20 magnification.\nDetermine the relative amount of collagen (which appears as red under a light microscope) using a computerized image analysis program and express as an average percentage of the arterial cross-sectional area. Qualitative analysis of fiber thickness/age is assessed by delineating green and red fibers indicated under polarized light, as fiber color variation transits from green to red proportional to the increase of fiber thickness/age. The relative amount of each fiber color is expressed as a percentage of the total amount of collagen in the area of interest.\nCritical: Ensure slides are dry before placing in 100% alcohol toward the end of the staining, as any residual water will cause the Picrosirius Red stain to leach from the section.\nHistological Processing: Immunohistochemistry for Alpha-Smooth Muscle Actin and ER-TR7\nTiming: 1 day\nFrom the formalin-fixed wax-embedded arterial rings, cut 3 μm sections collected upon adhesive glass microscope slides (two sections per slide).\nTo enable assessment of vascular smooth muscle cell phenotypic modulation and density, and assess fibroblast presence, perform immunohistochemistry for alpha-smooth muscle actin (αSMactin) and ER-TR7 expression, respectively.\nDewax sections by placing in three changes of Clearene for the duration of 5 min in each.\nRehydrate sections by placing in three changes of graduated alcohol (100%, 90% and 70%) for the duration of 5 min in each.\nRinse in distilled H2O.\nPlace slides in a black trough with 10 mM citrate acid pH 6.0 (2.1 g/L distilled H2O)",
