    "1. Equipment, data acquisition and processing of autonomic signals \nAs a bare minimum, the clinical autonomic laboratory has to have motorized tilt table, ECG, noninvasive beat-to-beat blood pressure monitor, respiratory monitor and a mean to evaluate sudomotor functions. Recommended equipment is listed at Table 9. The data acquisition and analyzing software is a critical to be able to run the lab effectively. Unfortunately, the commercially suitable software has some restrictions and most of the autonomic laboratories wrote their own acquisition or analyzing software in house. Robust R wave detection and detection of corresponding systolic/diastolic values in blood pressure, eventually in blood flow, is of paramount importance. At University of Massachusetts we use ADInstrument-based recording system (Figures 1-4, Table 9) that is easy to program and provides many mathematical functions in real time.\nThe protocol use in the paper is based on methodology developed primary by Dr. P. Low and his team (1). This paper assumes that the reader knows how to correctly place ECG electrodes, setup of the continuous blood pressure monitor and how to record the data. Details of the electrode/sensor placement and recommended standards for data acquisition are at reference 4.\n2. Deep breathing\nDeep breathing tests cardiac parasympathetic functions. Because the heart responses to deep breathing are mediated by the vagal nerve, the test is also referred to as cardiovagal testing. Deep breathing evaluates changes in the instant heart rate that is provoked by “deep” breathing at 6 breaths/min. The test is performed in supine position. The test starts with a rest period that gives patient time to relax. We usually record one minute baseline before proceeding with the deep breathing test.\nObtain the baseline for one minute, instruct subject to relax.",
    "Instruct subject to inhale for 5 seconds and exhale for 5 seconds. This 10 second respiratory cycle should be repeated 6 times. Patient should breathe continuously and regularly. Respirator movement should resemble a wave. Sudden inhalations/exhalations or holding the breath should be avoided. Care should be taken not to hyperventilate. Preferentially, breathing should be done through nostrils with closed mouth and the end tidal CO2 should be monitored to rule out hyperventilation\nCalculate the respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). RSA amplitude is defined as the difference between the end of expiration and end of inspiration in heart rate. Typically, 6 respiratory cycles are identified (Figure. 5) and the respective RSA amplitudes are averaged.\nNormative values\nNormative data are at Table 1. \nInterpretation of results\nDeep breathing test measures cardiovagal functions. Both deep breathing and Valsalva maneuver are needed for grading of cardiovagal functions. Valsalva maneuver and grading of cardiovagal impairment is described below.\n3. Valsalva maneuver\nValsalva maneuver evaluates: 1) sympathetic adrenergic functions using the blood pressure responses ; and 2) cardiovagal (parasympathetic) functions using the heart rate responses. Valsalva maneuver consists of forced expiration against the resistance with the expiratory pressure during strain at 40 mm Hg for 15 seconds.\nMouthpiece assembly\n The easy way to measure the expiratory pressure is to connect the pressure gauge  to the 5-10 ml plastic syringe and to blow inside the syringe or any similar mouthpiece. There should be a small air leak in the tubing to prevent closing of the glottis.\nTechnique\nValsalva maneuver is usually performed in supine position. If Valsalva maneuver shows a square-box response and no heart failure is suspected, the table can be turned up 30 degree that can change the Valsalva maneuever to more common four phase pattern.",
    "Let the subject practice at least one Valsalva maneuver for short time (seconds) until the subject is comfortable with the procedure.\nWait approximately 1 minute to allow the subject to be relaxed.\nInstruct the subject to: “Take deep breath and blow into the syringe.  Keep the pressure 40 mm Hg for 15 seconds”. The subject should see the expiratory pressure as he can adjust the strain. Give the subject feedback how many seconds left. If the pressure is suboptimal, instruct subject to correct the pressure or repeat the Valsalva maneuver.\nWait 3 minutes.\nRepeat Valsalva maneuver twice, total 3 times\nSelect the most representative maneuver for evaluation.\nObtain the following parameters from Valsalva maneuver (Figure 9 and Figure 11):\n  \nValsalva ratio.\nMaximal drop of the mean blood pressure during phase 2.\nThe peak of the mean blood pressure at the end of late phase 2 (recovery).\nOvershoot, phase 4.\nMaximal pulse pressure drop during phase 2\nPressure recovery time\nNormative values:\nNormative values are at Table 2 and Table 3. \nInterpretation of results\nValsalva maneuver evaluates both adrenergic and cardiovagal functions. Grading of adrenergic impairment requires both Valsalva maneuver and tilt test.  Grading of cardiovagal impairment requires both deep breathing and Valsalva ratio.\n4. Tilt testing\nThe test stimulates the autonomic nervous system with orthostatic stress by passive movement from a supine position to an upright tilt in a controlled laboratory setting.\nTechnique\nEnsure proper placement of the blood pressure sensor. Ideal blood pressure has well defined dicrotic notch and there is no drift of the baseline.\nGet the baseline blood pressure from the  brachial artery.\nAcquire the 5-10 minutes baseline\nTilt patient up. The tilt should be done at 70 degree. The transition from supine to tilt position should smooth and of duration 5-10 seconds.",
    "Obtain the blood pressure from a brachial artery every minute.\nObserve subject for the presence of any discomfort, chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope. Be prepared to terminate the tilt of any serious event occurs during the tilt based on clinical judgment.\nTypical duration of the tilt should be 10 minutes. The tilt can be continued if no obvious abnormalities are detected but a clinical history is strongly suggestive of dysautonomia or blood pressure instability.\nTilt the patient back.\nNormative values:\nThe normal responses in heart rate during the tilt is heart rate increment within 10 - 30 beats per minute. At the same time the maximal heart rate should be less than 120 beats per minute. Normal responses in the blood pressure during the tilt is  drop of the systolic blood pressure less than 30 mm Hg or drop of the mean blood pressure less than 20 mm Hg.\nInterpretation of results\nTilt tests predominantly evaluates adrenergic functions. Grading of adrenergic impairment requires results from both Valsalva maneuver and tilt test and is described in section 6.\n5. Sudomotor testing (QSART)\nQuantitative Sudomotor Axon Reflex Test (QSART) evaluates the postganglionic sympathetic cholinergic functions. Most commonly used devices is the Q-Sweat made by WR Medical Electronic. There are 2 types of responses: spontaneous and evoked. Typically larger capsules  (sampling area 5.06 cm2, volume 3.614 cm3 ) are used for spontaneous responses and smaller capsules (sampling area 0.7871 cm2, volume 0.1229 cm3) for evoked responses.  In the following, all applies for the smaller capsule. For the stimulation, typical settings are: current 2 mA, 5 minutes, \nAssemble the capsules according to the manufacturer recommendation (Figure 20).",
    "Clean the recording sites vigorously with the alcohol. Recording sites are:1) the medial forearm  (75 % distance from the ulnar epicondile to the pisiform bone); 2) the proximal leg (5 cm distal to the fibular head laterally); 3) the distal leg (5 cm proximal to the medial malleolus medially); 4) proximal foot over the extensor digitorum brevis muscle.\nPlace the capsules water-tight (Figure 21).\nFill the capsules with 10% acetylcholine diluted in sterile water (not normal saline !). \nStart sweat recording and verify on the Q-Sweat machine that no leak is present. In the case of the leak, fix the capsule placement.\nPlace the ground for stimulation about 5 cm next to the capsule.\nWait until the baseline sweat is flat, below 100 nanoliters/minute and all channels give similar baseline sweat output (difference < 15 %, Figure 22-23).\nStart stimulation at current 2 mA for 5 minutes, turn on the marker (Figure 24).\nRecord another 5 minute of the sweat (total 10 minutes), turn on the marker.\nObtain the latencies and volumes at each site (Figure. 25)\nNormative values\nNormative values are at Table 4. \nInterpretation of results\nGrading of sudomotor impairment is below\n6. Grading of autonomic impairment using the Composite Autonomic Severity Score (CASS)\nCASS score provides unbiased and full quantification of the autonomic functions in cardiovagal, adrenergic and sudomotor domain. Total score has a direct clinical meaning since it ranks the generalized dysautonomia as mild, moderate and severe.  I removed some of ambiguities in the original definition of CASS( 3).\nThe CASS has the following subscores: 1) Cardiovagal (Table 5 ).;  2) Adrenergic (Table 6);  and 3) Sudomotor (Table 7).",
    "For calculation of cardiovagal score both deep breathing and Valsalva ratio are required. Adrenergic score requires both Valsalva maneuver and tilt test results. Sudomotor score can be calculated from QSART results or from the thermoregulator sweat test (TST, not described at this paper).\nSince the autonomic testing evaluates global autonomic functions, the results are interpreted in term of generalized autonomic failure (GAF). Results are referred to as normal (CASS total score = 0) or abnormal. The abnormalities ranges from mild GAF (total CASS score 1-3), to moderate (total CASS score 4-6), or severe (total CASS score 7-10). \nMild GAF with score 1 is usually of unclear or limited clinical significance. The score higher than 1 is usually clinically significant and usually indicate the presence of autonomic neuropathy.\n7. Representative results:\nExamples of data acquisitions are at Figure 1-4. All recorded signal should be clearly visible from a distance to a technician enabling the correct any recordings problems immediately. Both raw data and corresponding systolic/diastolic/mean values should be available in real time (Figure 1). The data acquisition system should provide a great amount of flexibility in the setting of the screen, for example it should be easy to change the time scale (Figure 2) or to choose between raw data tracings or numerical values (Figure 3).\nExamples of normal and abnormal deep breathing test are at Figure 6-8. For clarity, the length of the bold line in the middle of the y axis correspond to 10 BPM. Normal deep breathing test is at Figure 6.  Note that normative data for the deep breathing test are age but not gender dependent (Table 1). Figure 7 shows moderate abnormality of the cardiovagal functions while Figure 8 shows essentially fixed heart rate that is consistent with severe cardiovagal failure.",
    "Figure 9 shows typical 4 phases in Valsalva maneuver. Note that pressure recovery time is calculated from the systolic blood pressure. A square-wave variant of Valsalva maneuver is at Figure 10. Valsalva ratio calculation is shown at Figure 11.  Figure 12 shows normal blood pressure responses. Mild (Figure 13), moderate (Figure 14) and severe (Figure 15) adrenergic impairment results in a distinct blood pressure changes provoked by VM.\nFigure 16 shows normal responses in heart rate and blood pressure during 10 minutes of tilt test.\nMild orthostatic hypotension associated with mild adrenergic impairment is seen at Figure 17 .Note also prominent fluctuations in both blood pressure and blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery that can be associated with adrenergic impairment. Severe adrenergic impairment can results in a progressive fall of the blood pressure as is seen in Figure 18. Example of  mixed syncope that has features of both vasodepressors and vasovagal responses is at Figure 19.\nNormal QSART responses are at Figure 26. Abnormalities ranging from mild to severe sudomotor impairment are at Figures 28-31.\ntable:\n﻿0,1\nAge range (years),Minimum for normal RSA (beats/min)\n10-29,≥14\n30-39,≥12\n40-49,≥10\n50-59,≥9\n60-69,≥7\nTable 1.
