    "1. Biological Materials Science\nWear personal protective equipment (i.e., gloves, safety glasses and lab coat) and follow all applicable safety procedures for using dissecting tools.\nRinse off the forceps and scalpel with distilled water to use for dissection.\nThaw a frozen pink sea urchin at RT for 1 hr. Place a thawed specimen in a glass dish with sufficient space to be able to maneuver the urchin and cutting tools. Turn the urchin upside down so that the teeth tips face up.\n\t\nCut away the connective tissue around the perimeter of the Aristotle's lantern with the scalpel and carefully lift out the lantern. Rinse the lantern off with running distilled water. Discard unused urchin parts in a proper waste disposal container.\nTurn the Aristotle's lantern over again so the tips of the teeth face down. Locate the plumula end of each tooth (opposite to the tip) facing up and use the forceps to carefully slide out individual teeth from the lantern.\nPrepare epoxy to pot the teeth. Weigh 5 g of resin and add 1.15 g of hardener (e.g., 100 parts resin to 23 parts hardener by weight) in a shallow disposable plastic tray. Mix contents together slowly without forming bubbles.\n\tNote: Do not leave leftover mixed epoxy in a container with insufficient exposure to the atmosphere. The curing process is exothermic and can ignite nearby flammables. Keep any leftover mixed epoxy in a well-ventilated fume hood away from flammable items.\n\t\nLubricate a 2.5 dram plastic tube (22 mm inner diameter, 39 mm length) using petroleum jelly applied with a finger and wipe off any excess with a tissue. Fill up the tube halfway with mixed epoxy.",
    "Use the forceps to pick up a tooth and carefully submerge it in the epoxy with the curved concave side facing up. Let the epoxy cure at RT for 24 hr.\n\t\tNote: Prevent the tooth tip from drifting to touch the plastic tube wall as the epoxy cures since this will make polishing the tip more difficult.\nPlace the plastic tube with cured epoxy in a vise. Tighten the vise slowly until a fissure is made in the plastic tube. Peel away residual plastic from the epoxy surface.\n\t\nUse a sectioning saw to cut the epoxy around the tooth down to a smaller block (1 cm3).\nPrepare a clean area for polishing and set up a flat work station with a hard plastic board. Fill a squirt bottle with distilled water.\n\t\nStart with the lowest grit sandpaper available (e.g., 120) and squeeze a small amount of water from the wash bottle onto the sandpaper. Using light pressure, rub the sample in one back and forth direction (e.g., left-right) for 5 min.\nWash off the surface of the sample over a sink and wipe off with a particle-free tissue. Remove any leftover sandpaper grit with compressed air for 15 sec.\nUse progressively higher grit sandpaper (e.g., 600 and 2,400) to repeat protocol steps 1.6.1 and 1.6.2. Using light pressure, rub the sample in a back and forth direction perpendicular to the previous polish step (e.g., up-down, left-right).\n\t\tNote: Use a light microscope at 20X magnification to see perpendicular scratch marks intersect with each grit level (e.g., 120, 600, 2,400). Move to the next higher grit sandpaper when scratch marks from the previous grit level disappear.",
    "Prepare a squirt bottle with 3-µm diamond polishing suspension in a 1:1 distilled water solution. Use a polish cloth for diamond suspensions to repeat protocol steps 1.6.1 and 1.6.2.\nPrepare a squirt bottle with 0.5-µm alumina polishing suspension in a 1:1 distilled water solution. Use a microcloth polishing surface to repeat protocol steps 1.6.1 and 1.6.2.\n\t\tNote: Fine scratch marks from protocol steps 1.6.4 and 1.6.5 will not be visible at 20X magnification. For these protocol steps, polish for 5 min in a back and forth motion to remove all previous scratches.\nClean the polished surface with distilled water and use particle-free tissue with compressed air to carefully dry. Wrap with particle-free tissue to maintain mirror polished finish.\n\t\tNote: Dry all polishing surfaces face down on large particle-free tissues. Store in a plastic sleeve to avoid dust particles settling on the surface between polishing times.\nCharacterize the sea urchin tooth microstructure using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Use a sputter coater to sputter iridium with a deposition current of 85 mA for 10 sec onto the polished tooth surface for a coating thickness of ~20 nm.\n\t\nObtain micrograph images at 250X - 4,000X magnification using a SEM.\n\t\tNote: Use 5 kV in the scanning electron (SE) mode and 15 kV in the back-scattered electron (BSE) mode. Use BSE mode to identify calcite fibers interspersed with Mg-enriched polycrystalline matrix.\nPerform micro-computed tomography (µ-CT) scans of a whole pink sea urchin and a freshly dissected Aristotle's lantern. Position each thawed sample inside the closed chamber container with a moistened tissue to provide a humidified environment while scanning.",
    "Scan the whole urchin and the Aristotle's lantern by µ-CT with an isotropic voxel size of 36.00 µm and 9.06 µm, respectively. Apply an electrical potential of 100 kVp and 70 kVp with current of 100 mA and 141 mA, for the whole urchin and the Aristotle's lantern, respectively, using a 1.0 mm aluminum filter for both.\nApply a beam hardening correction algorithm during image reconstruction to account for beam hardening artifacts that result from the µ-CT x-ray source emitting x-rays of multiple energies using manufacturer's protocol.\nUse imaging software to refine image segmentation and acquire a triangle mesh model for the Aristotle's lantern structure.\n\t\nLoad and preview Aristotle's lantern image data from the µ-CT scan. Match the voxel size (9.06 µm) to the values from the micro-CT scan.\nUse a volume rendering function to visualize the Aristotle's lantern in 3D space. Adjust the 2D orthogonal slice with the Bounding Box module and adjust the threshold value/color with the Volume Rendering module.\nMake mask segments for the region of interest (e.g., sea urchin tooth) using the segmentation editor. Select XY, YZ, and XZ planes and the 3D isometric view. Use the magic wand (black arrow) to distinguish between simple structures (tooth vs. pyramid) in the Aristotle's lantern.\nReconstruct the model surface from the extracted mask segments. Select the Surface Generation module and apply. Deselect the Volume Rendering Settings to have the visible top surface disappear. Add the Surface View module to display the surface result.\nSimplify the model surface by reducing the number of faces to < 18,000.\nEdit individual triangle mesh on the model surface as needed. Save the model as a stereolithography (STL) file for exporting to use with computer-assisted design (CAD) modeling software.\n2. Bioinspired Design",
    "Use the Aristotle's lantern from the micro-CT scan as a reference to make a bioinspired design with CAD modeling software.\n\tNote: The bioinspired design has five curved teeth with height 6 cm and diameter 8 cm for the closed lantern. It is scaled up ~5x from the size of the natural Aristotle's lantern.\nSave the STL file parts to a flash drive and upload the files to a fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer.\n\t\nLoad acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic and support plastic material cartridges into the appropriate slots of the 3D printer.\nInsert the modeling base on the Z platform and align tabs with slots on the metal tray.\nOpen each of the STL file parts and follow the display screen steps to print all the lantern parts at the same time.\n\t\tNote: Lantern parts must fit within the building envelope (25 x 25 x 30 cm3) for the 3D printer. All five teeth are arranged on the modeling base and printed simultaneously with the tooth tip facing up. The build rate is 16 cm3 per hour and the total build time is approximately 8 hr.\nRelease the modeling base from the tabs when all file parts are printed and slide the base out of the 3D printer along the tray guides.\nUse a metal spatula to pry all parts off the base and a metal file to wear down any extra plastic attached to the parts.\nPlace the printed parts into a heated base bath until the support plastic material dissolves.\nFasten each tooth to a joint arm with a link rod and two E-retaining rings on either side.\n\tNote: Refer to Figure 6 for assembly of the bioinspired Aristotle's lantern.\n3.
