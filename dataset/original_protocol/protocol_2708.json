    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nStereotaxic surgery\nTiming: 1.5 h per animal\nA targeted stereotaxic injection straight into the dentate gyrus of anesthetized mice allows for site specific expression of Halo-actin in the soma and distant boutons of dentate granule cells.\nPlease adjust injection protocols in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee regulations as well as Institutional Environmental Health and Biological Safety requirements. In our case, all experimental procedures were approved by Albert Einstein College of Medicine’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol numbers 00001043 and 00001053).\nPrepare Hamilton syringe. Disinfect with 70% ethanol and rinse with Milli-Q water multiple times.\nCritical: Ensure no ethanol remains in the Hamilton syringe before virus is loaded. This can lead to viral loss and no expression in injected animals.\nCritical: The method for disinfecting lentiviruses is to soak in a 10% bleach solution for several minutes followed by rinse in water and disposal into medical waste bins.\nDisinfect and prepare stereotaxic surgical setup and tools.\nThis can be achieved by wiping setup and all tools with 70% ethanol and Kimwipe. It is also recommended to disinfect tools in bead sterilizer prior to usage.\nWhile tools are in bead sterilizer, pickup animals from animal facility. It is recommended to bring all animals to a bench near your stereotaxic setup to have consistency in time between animals.\nPrepare dental drill and surgical supplies in surgical area.\nObtain betadine, premixed 0.9% saline solution, and 70% ethanol in 50 mL falcon tubes. Prepare small container with 10% bleach.\nFill the vaporizer with isoflurane. Ensure oxygen is connected well and the general anesthesia setup is functional.\nPlace all sterilized tools on sterile pad.\nGather ophthalmic ointment.\nPrepare microinjector pump control.\nThaw −80°C Halo-actin reporter viral aliquots by placing them on wet ice.",
    "Once Hamilton syringe is attached to stereotaxic setup according to manufacturer’s instructions, slowly load virus into the syringe. Load enough virus to inject all mice for the day plus 20% extra.\nNote: Viral stock is susceptible to titer loss from freeze-thaw cycles. To ensure consistent titers, remove aliquots from −80°C freezer as needed.\nPrepare recovery area.\nGently place a clean cage with top on a heating pad.\nCritical: Ensure that cage has no bedding. This can lead to choking as animal wakes up from anesthesia.\nAnesthetize and mount mouse on stereotaxic apparatus.\nTurn on oxygen flow to the isoflurane induction chamber.\nPlace the mouse in the induction chamber and then turn on flow of isoflurane to 5%. Wait for the mouse to become sedated. After initial rapid breathing, breathing normalization (a single breath every 3 s is indicative of sufficient sedation).\nAdjust flow from induction chamber and decrease from 5% to 3% isoflurane.\nGently remove mouse from chamber and mount onto the stereotaxic frame using bite bar.\nSlide nose cone over mouse’s nose, then decrease the flow of isoflurane to 2%.\nNote: Pinching the hind paw is another way to ensure proper sedation has been achieved before securing animal in the stereotaxic frame.\nCritical: It is vital to adjust level of anesthesia according to mouse breathing rate and sedation. Faster respiration may require slow increases in anesthesia and should be adjusted accordingly throughout the experimental procedure.\nGently adjust the mouse so that mouse head looks straight and level.\nGently progress the ear bars into the ear canal. In conjunction with the nose cone, the skull should be completely stabilized.\nIf there is still movement, loosen ear bars, adjust the mouse head and try again.",
    "To test whether the skull is stable, look at the head from top and then from the side to ensure it looks level. Press gently on top of head to make sure mouse does not move in response.\nPlace ophthalmic ointment on mouse eyes using sterile swab.\nExpose the skull.\nGently shave the fur from the mouse head.\nSterilize the scalp by applying betadine on a cotton swab in circular motion.\nUsing surgical scissors, make a single vertical incision at the midline starting from the posterior to the eyes.\nSplay each layer of tissue open until you have a visible field of view.\nUsing a sterile swab with 70% EtOH, gently wipe the exposed skull. This cleans off any muscle and tissue still attached before drilling.\nInject lentivirus into the region of interest.\nDetermine injection location using dissection scope or magnification glasses.\nFirstly, find bregma.\nFor lentivirus injection into the DG between P21-P24, established coordinates are -2.2 posterior to Bregma (y-coordinate), 2.0 laterally (x-coordinate), and 2.0 ventral (z-coordinate) from dura with lambda being 0.05 units higher than bregma.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]\nAfter determining x- and y-coordinates, lower tip to the skull where it is barely touching and zero the microinjector pump control at bregma.\nThen, go to lambda and measure z-coordinate.\nAdjust nose cone height until you achieve an angle of 0.05.\nAfter value is recorded, raise syringe to avoid drill hitting the tip.\nUsing micro-drill, slowly drill a single bore hole through the skill at point of determined injection at x-and y-position.\nSlight bleeding is normal, but care should be taken to pause until bleeding stops.\nBefore lowering needle into brain through drilled burr hole, manually press button on microinjector and continue to apply pressure until you see a bead of liquid exit the tip of the Hamilton syringe.",
    "Using paper tissue (Kimwipe), gently wipe away the bead of the injection solution and discharge into a small container of 10% bleach.\nInject viral solution.\nRe-position the tip of the injection syringe to the brain’s surface. Gently advance until you go 2.0 ventral from dura.\nEject virus at a flowrate with a total volume of 1.5 mL/ hemisphere at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min.\nDo not withdraw the needle right after injection. Wait at least 7–8 min to allow injection solution to spread locally into tissue. After sufficient time has passed, very gently withdraw the needle over 1–2 min.\nClose the scalp.\nUsing tweezers, pull together two halves of the scalp and suture (Nylon, 5-0, NFS-2).\nRemove ear bars and deliver a small injection of normal saline for post-surgical fluid resuscitation (1 mL). Place mouse in the recovery cage with heated pad underneath.\nClean up the surgical area, disinfect and dispose of all material appropriately. Repeat steps 1–10 for all remaining experimental cohort.\nNote: We do not wash the syringe between injections, as exposure of the tip to 70% ethanol will result in viral loss. In between injections, the syringe is stored within a secondary container.\nNote: Follow all institutional guidelines for post-surgical care.\nNote: In order to achieve optimal expression of your reporter or biosensor, we strongly recommend testing different amounts of virus, as well as flowrates. Duration of expression should also be optimized. For the purposes of this protocol, we waited for 2–3 weeks after injection for expression.\nAcute hippocampal slice preparation\nTiming: 1 h\nThese steps will result in preparation of acute hippocampal slices from virus-injected mouse (age range: P35-45).\nGather tools and solutions for hippocampal dissection and slicing. Prepare ice bucket (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).",
    "Prepare NMDG solution. Prepare ACSF. Bubble NMDG and ACSF with carbogen (5% carbon dioxide, 95% oxygen) for at least 10 min on ice before starting.\nRemove agar from fridge (that was prepared in mold) and cut block with blade (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B–1F). Cut perpendicular to create a block (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C), cut across to create a well (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D and 1E), and then thinly slice bottom to create a lid (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nCalibrate vibratome blade and set proper settings.\nExpose the experimental animal to isoflurane until the nociceptive reflexes expire.\nIn under 30 s, decapitate the animal, remove brain (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G) and put into ice cold NMDG cutting solution.\nIsolate hippocampi (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H), adjust on block (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]I), and cut using VT1200s vibratome at a thickness of 300 μm (recommended cutting speed: 0.1 mm/s, Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]J). Fill the slicing chamber with ice-cold NMDG and fill the outer chamber of the vibratome with ice.\nCritical: The MF axons are long and fragile, so it is important that the hippocampal dissection is done extremely carefully, and hippocampi are placed securely in the block to avoid damaging the mossy fibers during slicing.\nNote: Alternative slice orientations to study other brain regions should work equally well. This particular set of instructions will result in transverse hippocampal slices, and coronal slices can be cut as well. All subsequent steps in this protocol will remain nearly identical regardless of the brain region.\nUse a transfer pipette to move slices into the bubbling ACSF-filled slice holding chamber which contains a plastic mesh fixed onto a ring11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]K).\nPause point: Let the slices recover for at least 30 min in the slice holding chamber at room temperature (RT, 21°C–24°C) before beginning HaloTag labeling protocol. Make sure the brain slices stay continuously oxygenated.\nHalo-actin labeling during slice recovery",
    "Timing: 3–4 h\nThis major step describes the pulse-chase assay which allows us to label Halo-actin that was newly synthesized in an intervening time window. This approach enables the detection of newly synthesized Halo-actin in MFBs.\nWhile slices recover, remove the dye-conjugated HTL of choice from the −20°C freezer.\nPrepare a desired dilution of HTL in ACSF from stock solution in a 20 mL Pyrex beaker.\nNote: The final concentration of JF549-HTL is 100 nM and JF646-HTL is 200 nM. The labeling conditions may need to be determined empirically for your specific gene of interest, using appropriate negative control experiments such as cycloheximide (CHX, translation inhibitor).\nFor the detection of newly translated proteins, cell-permeable Halo-ligand conjugated to a tetraalkylrhodamine derivatives (JF549-HTL or JF646-HTL) will be bath-applied sequentially for the pulse-chase assay.\nUsing 20 mL Pyrex beaker, add RT ACSF and start bubbling with carbogen and add JF549-HTL to a final concentration of 100 nM.\nAfter 10 min of bubbling, gently collect slices with a transfer pipette and place in the beaker.\nLabel for 1 h. 10 min before the hour is up, obtain a second 20 mL beaker and start bubbling RT ACSF (10 mL).\nAfter the hour is up, gently remove slices from the dye cocktail picking up as little of solution as possible and transfer to bubbling ACSF.\nWash in ACSF for 30 min. 10 min before the 30 min are up, obtain another graduated cylinder and start bubbling RT ACSF.\nPause point: Bath-application of halo dye and wash out will now allow you to detect Halo-actin expressing cells using epifluorescence to screen slices. If your experimental question requires detecting newly synthesized protein after a certain manipulation, pre-screening slices for detectable viral expression is advised.\nCritical: Slices must stay well oxygenated throughout all procedures.",
    "Towards the end of the 30-min ACSF wash or experimental manipulations (if performed), add JF646-HTL (200 nM) to the bubbling ACSF beaker and pipette slices into this beaker to label newly synthesized Halo-actin. Label for 1 h.\nFinally, transfer labeled slices to a fresh ACSF beaker and wash out for 30 min.\nNote: Some controls that can be conducted here include reversing order of dye and adding translation inhibitor, CHX (80 μM).\nAfter washout, fix slices with 4% PFA in a 24-well plate overnight (10–12 h) at 4°C. Wrap the plate with aluminum foil to avoid any bleaching of fluorescence signal.\nNext day, replace PFA with 1× PBS.\nMount and arrange the sections without any folds or wrinkles onto slides using a brush. Take extreme care to not damage the tissue sections.\nMultiple hippocampal slices can be mounted on the same slide.\nRemove excess 1× PBS with Kimwipe.\nApply few drops of ProLong™ Diamond Antifade Mountant with DAPI and place cover glass.\nLeave the slides in the dark at RT and let them cure overnight (10–12 h). Seal the slides the following day with nail polish, let dry, and store slides at 4°C.\nImage acquisition and Airyscan processing\nTiming: 30 min per hippocampal slice",
    "MFBs are highly variable in shape and size.12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] To achieve high-resolution images of these boutons, and to be able to precisely detect changes in Halo-actin synthesis, we turned to Zeiss LSM 880 with Airyscan. A classic confocal microscope utilizes a pinhole to reject out-of-focus light from reaching the detector to generate an optically sectioned image. Although in principle a small pinhole improves optical resolution, in most biological imaging a compromise must be made between image resolution and signal-to-noise. To overcome limitations of traditional scanning confocal microscopy, Zeiss introduced the Airyscan detector, which is composed of a 32-channel area detector set in a shape of a honeycomb, where each channel simultaneously captures a different position of the point spread function. This allows each channel to behave as a small pinhole to maximize resolution while allowing a larger overall pinhole to improve signal-to-noise ratio.13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]\nOn the day of imaging, turn on the microscope and necessary lasers (561 nm and 647 nm laser lines).\nClean the 63× objective.\nSettings as follows:\nPlan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 Oil DIC M27 and 1.8× zoom.\nKeep threshold, laser power, and gain constant for each experimental group imaged.\nAlso, importantly, set pixel width and height as 0.049 μm and voxel depth as 0.187 μm.\nAfter locating the stratum lucidum, take z-stacks throughout axon bundle at similar depths such that boutons are captured in their entirety.\nMake sure step size is set to optimal.\nNote: For our purposes, we took three z-stacks through the entire z-plane of the tissue where boutons are visible (one in CA3a, one in CA3b, and one in CA3c). At the end, the depth imaged was about 10 μm with a z-stack consisting of about 50 frames.\nAiryscan process images. Make sure acquisition settings remain identical between treatment groups and imaging days."
