    "1. Fabrication of growth and imaging device\nSU8 mold fabrication\n\t\nDesign patterns 1 (flow layer) and 2 (control layer) using rectangular shapes in a word processing software (or a computer-aided design CAD software) and print the photomasks with the help of a laser plotter with a minimum feature size of 8 µm on polyester-based film (Figure 1).\nCut silicon wafers in 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm pieces and clean them with 20% KOH for 1 min. Rinse the wafers in deionized (DI) water. Use one wafer each for the flow and the control layer.\n\t\tCAUTION: KOH is corrosive and should be handled with care.\nDry the pieces with 14 psi compressed nitrogen gas followed by dehydration on a hot plate at 120 °C for 4 h. Before proceeding to the next step, cool the two pieces down to room temperature.\nTake one of the silicon pieces and put it on the chuck of a spin coater and turn on the vacuum to hold the wafer in place. On the silicon piece, put ~20 µL of hexamethyldisilane (HMDS) and coat it using the spin coater at 500 rotation per min (rpm) for 5 s followed by 3,000 rpm for 30 s.\n\t\tCAUTION: This step should be performed in yellow light. Do not use white light in the room.\nTo get a uniform photoresist thickness of ~40 µm (specific to the flow layer; suitable for imaging early larval stage 1 to stage 3 (L1 - L3) animals), coat the silicon wafer with ~1.5 mL of negative photoresist-1 using a spin coater at 500 rpm for 5 s followed by 2,000 rpm for 30 s.\nRepeat steps 1.1.4 and 1.1.5 with the second wafer to obtain a uniform photoresist thickness of ~40 µm specific to the control layer.",
    "Alternatively, to increase the thickness of the flow layer to ~80 µm for older animals, coat silicon wafers with ~1.5 mL of negative photoresist-2 using the spin coater at 500 rpm for 5 s followed by 2,000 rpm for 30 s. This thickness is suitable for L3 stage to adult animals.\n\t\tCAUTION: Hold the silicon wafers by their sides to avoid any damage to the spin-coated layers. Keep white lights turned off during this step.\nBake the photoresist-coated silicon pieces (for flow and control layers) on a hot plate at 65 °C for 1 min followed by 95 °C for 10 min. Cool the baked pieces to room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: The baked silicon pieces can be stored for one day before proceeding to the next step. Store in the dark and do not expose to white light.\nPut soft-baked silicon pieces on the exposure stage of the UV illuminator with the photoresist-coated surface facing the UV lamp. Expose the two pieces separately to UV for 15 s, using a 200 W lamp, through a photomask with patterns 1 and 2 to get flow and control layers, respectively.\n\t\tCAUTION: Wear safety goggles and avoid direct exposure to UV light. Do not turn on white light in the room during this stage.\nBake the two exposed silicon pieces with coated layer facing up, at 65 °C followed by 95 °C for 1 min and 10 min respectively. Cool the pieces to room temperature before proceeding to the next step.\nDevelop the patterns by soaking the silicon pieces in the photoresist developer solution (1:3 dilution of the developer in isopropanol) for 20 min. Once the pattern is visible, rinse the pieces with pure iso-propyl alcohol (IPA) and gently blow dry using nitrogen gas (14 psi).",
    "CAUTION: Use a well-ventilated environment for this chemical treatment to avoid human exposure. Use white light only after features are developed and rinsed with IPA.\nKeep the silicon pieces in a desiccator with the coated surface facing up. Expose the pieces to silane vapors by pouring 50 µL of pure trichloro (1H, 1H, 2H, 2H-perfluorooctyl) silane on a small plastic cup or a glass slide. Place the cup/slide inside a desiccator and incubate for 2 h.\n\t\tCAUTION: Avoid direct exposure to silane vapor. Always use a sealed chamber for silane vapor treatment.\n\t\tNOTE: If necessary, the developed silicon pieces can be stored for 1-2 days before proceeding to the next step.\nPDMS chip fabrication\n\t\nMake PDMS in a plastic cup by mixing the elastomer base with the curing agent in a 10:1 ratio. Mix the contents well by stirring constantly for 3 min. The mixing will create a lot of air bubbles in the PDMS mix.\nDegas the PDMS mix in a desiccator for 30 min to remove all air bubbles.\n\t\tCAUTION: Ensure air bubbles are removed from the PDMS mix before it is poured on the features since bubbles can cause defective and non-functional devices.\nPlace the silicon wafers with the control layer (pattern 2) in a Petri dish. Gently pour a 5 mm thick PDMS mix layer on the silicon piece avoiding any bubble formation.\nDegas the PDMS mix in a desiccator to remove additional bubbles that are formed during PDMS pouring process.",
    "Place the silicon wafer with flow layer (pattern 1) on the spinner chuck applying 200-500 mTorr vacuum pressure to hold the wafer. Pour ~1 mL of PDMS on the silicon wafer and coat it using a spin coater at 500 rpm for 5 s followed by 1,000 rpm for 30 s to get an ~80 µm thick layer.\nBake the two silicon wafers with the spin coated PDMS and poured PDMS layers at 50 °C in a hot air convection oven for 6 h. After baking, wait for the pieces to cool down at room temperature.\nCut the 5 mm thick PDMS layer from the silicon piece around the control layer (pattern 2) using a sharp blade and peel it off from the silicon substrate.\nPunch two holes of ~1 mm diameter using a Harris puncher at the reservoir of the PDMS block to connect the immobilization channel and isolation channel inlets to the gas lines for PDMS membrane deflections.\nPlace the silicon piece with the spin coated PDMS layer on the pattern 1 (flow layer), with the PDMS-coated surface facing up, on a plastic tray. Keep the punched PDMS block with pattern 2 (control layer) on the tray with molded side facing up.\nKeep the plastic tray inside a plasma cleaner and expose the two PDMS surfaces to 18 W air plasma for 2 min under low vacuum (200-600 mTorr). Apply vacuum until the chamber turns bright violet. Perform this step under low light to see the plasma color change.\nTake out the two plasma-treated blocks and gently bind the blocks by pressing the plasma-treated surfaces of patterns 1 and 2 together. Bake the bonded patterns at 50 °C for 2 h in a hot air convection oven.",
    "Take the bonded device out of the oven. Cut the bonded device out of silicon wafer with pattern 1 and pattern 2, and punch holes in the inlet and outlet reservoirs of the flow layer using the Harris puncher.\nPlace the bonded PDMS block with the flow layer facing up on a plastic tray. Keep a clean cover glass (#1.5) on the same tray. Expose the blocks and the cover glass to 18 W air plasma for 2 min. Adjust vacuum pressure to see a violet chamber.\n\t\tNOTE: This step should be done in low light to see the plasma color change. To clean the cover glass, wash it with IPA and blow dry using nitrogen gas at 14 psi.\nPlace the plasma exposed PDMS block on top of the cover glass and bake the bonded structure in an oven at 50 °C for 2 h. Store the device in a clean chamber for any future experiment.\n2. PDMS membrane priming\nTake the device and put it on a stereomicroscope and attach the tubings. Connect micro flex tube (inner diameter ~5 mm, outer diameter ~8 mm) to a compressed nitrogen gas line on one end. Connect a three-way connector on the other end. Tubes 1 and 2 of the three-way connectors will be connected to the trap and isolating membranes, respectively.\nConnect two micro flex tubes (inner diameter ~1.6 mm, outer diameter ~5 mm) to the two outlet ports of the three-way stopcock. Connect the other end of the two tubes to an 8 mm long 18 G needle.",
    "Fill the flow layer with M9 buffer using a micropipette through the inlet port. Fill both tubes with DI water through the end connected to the needle. Insert the two needles into the punched holes, connecting the isolating and trapping membrane, respectively.\nOpen the nitrogen gas regulator at 14 psi and turn the three-way valve from tube 1 to push the water into the device through the microfluidic channels in the control layers namely, the trap and isolation membranes.\nWait until water fills the channel without the presence of any air droplet in both channels. Once the channels are completely filled with water, the channels are considered to be primed.\nRelease the pressure using the three-way stopcock once the channels are filled with water and primed. Priming can lead to bubbles in the flow layer, remove the bubbles by flowing additional media through the flow channel.\n3. C. elegans maintenance and synchronization\nNOTE: C. elegans strains: The study used following transgenes PS3239 (dpy-20(e1282) syIs49 IV [MH86p(dpy-20(+) + pJB100(ZMP-1::GFP)]) for vulval development32, jsIs609 (mec7p::MLS(mitochondrial matrix localization signal)::GFP)33 for touch receptor neuron (TRN) development and mitochondria transport imaging, and wdIs51(F49H12.4::GFP + unc-119(+)) to track PVD development34. Standard C. elegans culture and maintenance protocol was followed35.\nGrow C. elegans on the nematode growth medium (NGM) Petri plates with E. coli OP50 as the food source at 22 °C. Maintain the C. elegans strains by repeatedly transferring a few hermaphrodites or chunking a small amount of agar with a few animals to a new NGM plate with an OP50 lawn.\nAfter 3-5 days, check the NGM plate for animal growth and C. elegans eggs. Collect and transfer approximately 30 eggs from a plate to a fresh NGM plate with OP50 lawn.",
    "To synchronize animals for imaging, transfer all unhatched eggs from the plate every 2 h to a fresh plate and maintain them at 22 °C. Approximately 15-20 eggs will hatch on each plate.\nPick the animals between 14-16 h and 28-30 h after hatching for larval 2 (L2) and larval 3 (L3) stages, respectively. Transfer the animals to the microfluidic device for imaging. Add food supply as described in the next section to maintain the animal inside the device for long-term growth and imaging experiments.\n4. C. elegans growth inside the growth and imaging microfluidic device\nMount a growth and imaging microfluidic device on an inverted microscope and view pattern 2, after connecting the isolation membranes and immobilization membrane, at low magnifications (4x or 10x). Ensure that the channels are filled with clean distilled water.\nPrepare a fresh 1 L solution of S medium using 10 mL of 1 M potassium citrate pH 6.0, 10 mL of trace metals solution, 3 mL of 1 M CaCl2, 3 mL of 1 M MgSO4. Prepare the solution under sterile conditions. Do not autoclave the S medium.\nFill the flow channel with growth media (S medium) 10 min before the experiment. Avoid any air bubbles in the flow channel. Flow additional medium if needed to remove air bubbles.\nPick a single animal from the required developmental stage from an NGM plate in 10 µL of S medium using a micropipette and push the animal into the flow channel through the inlet hole.\nMonitor the animal position in the flow channel using a low magnification objective. Flow additional medium through the inlet or outlet to push the animal and position it within the flow channel restricted between the two isolation membranes.",
    "Open the three-way stopcock to apply 14 psi pressure in the isolation channels and push the membranes down into the flow channel.\n\tNOTE: The membrane partially seals the flow channel and restricts animal movement to the region between the two isolation membranes.\nUse a single colony of E. coli OP50 from a streaked plate to inoculate 250 mL of L Broth (2.5 g bacto-tryptone, 1.25 g bacto-yeast, 1.25 g NaCl in H2O). Grow the inoculated culture overnight at 37 °C.\nAliquot 500 µL of OP50 culture into 1.5 mL sterile centrifuge tubes and store the stock and the aliquot for 2 weeks at 4 °C.\nPellet down OP50 culture by centrifugation at 1.3 x g for 5 min. Dissolve the pellet with 1 mL of fresh S medium (0.5x dilution) and store it at room temperature for 3-4 days. Use this diluted OP50 to feed C. elegans inside microfluidic devices.\nLeave a drop of S medium on top of the inlet and outlet reservoirs to reduce evaporation of the S medium in the flow channel.\nTake diluted OP50 solution in a 10 µL micropipette. Remove the micro tip filled with the OP50 solution from the pipette and press-fit the tip into the inlet reservoir. Then place another micropipette tip with 10 µL of food solution and insert it into the outlet reservoir.\nSeal the tip head applying pressure using a finger to ensure continuity of food solutions without any air gap. Change the micropipette tip with OP50 solution every day that is not older than 3-4 days.",
    "Fill an additional 20-30 µL of food solution in both the tips. Add or remove food solution to and from the micropipette tip to adjust the gradient to push the animal in the flow channel and to adjust the position of the animal under the trapping membrane for imaging.\nMonitor the flow of bacteria to ensure it is continuous through the partially closed isolation membranes in the flow channel using bright-field images.\n\t​NOTE: In absence of bacteria flow, animals might eat the available bacteria in the flow channel between the two isolation membranes. In case of no bacteria or no flow present in the channel, replace the two micropipette tips at the inlet and outlet with new pipette tips filled up with freshly prepared food supplies.\n5. C. elegans immobilization and imaging\nC. elegans immobilization under the trapping membrane\n\t\nLocate a single animal in the growth channel at low magnifications. Adjust the food solution heights in the two micropipette tips connected to the inlet and outlet reservoirs. Push the animal in the required direction using the hydrostatic pressure differences in the flow channel.\nPosition the animal at the center of the trapping membrane and monitor its swimming behavior using a low magnification objective (4x).\nTurn the three-way stopcock to increase the pressure in the trap channel slowly. Immobilize the animal under the trap membrane in a straight posture along the growth channel boundary wall.\n\t\tCAUTION: Avoid trapping the animal across the flow channel in a Z or U bend position. This causes the animal body to be squeezed with greater pressure and causes permanent damage to its health.\nC. elegans imaging and release from the membrane",
    "Carry and load the device on a microscope stage. Set up an inverted microscope at the desired imaging settings with all the necessary optical components (objective, light source, fluorescence filters, and a detector) for high-resolution bright field, differential imaging contrast (DIC), or fluorescence imaging (Supplementary Figure 1).\nAcquire a single or several time-lapse fluorescence images to capture cellular and sub-cellular events.\nAcquire fluorescence images of C. elegans neurons as a function of their development using a 60x, 1.4 numerical aperture (NA) objective, a 488 nm wavelength laser with 7%-10% laser power, a CCD camera, on a spinning disc microscope. Perform time-lapse imaging using the software provided with the microscope and acquire images at a speed of 4 frames per second (Supplementary Figure 1).\nAfter the acquisition of images, release the trapping pressure and monitor the locomotion of the animal at low magnifications - 4x and 10x. Keep the animal restricted within the region defined by isolating membranes (kept under 14 psi all through the experiment).\nAdjust the volume of food solution in the two micropipette tips to continue a slow gravity-driven food flow in the growth channel. This food flow is obtained by adjusting the levels of the food solutions in micropipettes at the inlet and the outlet (typically 1-5 mm height difference).\nVisualize the flow under a bright-field from the flow pattern of the bacteria in the growth channel.\n\t\tNOTE: In the absence of flow, the animal eats the available OP50 bacteria, the channel appears clear, and the animal starves over a few hours. A starved animal typically develops high autofluorescence, easily observable when acquiring time-lapse fluorescence images. Such events have detrimental effects on animal physiology and were avoided in the experiments.",
    "Repeat steps 5.2.1-5.2.3 after a predetermined time interval to acquire fluorescence/ DIC/bright-field images of the same individual at multiple time points.\nAfter the images are acquired at multiple desired time points from the same individual animal, release the isolation and trapping pressure. Flush the channel with M9 buffer and push the animal through the inlet reservoir. Recover the animal from the reservoir and place the animal on a fresh NGM plate for further health monitoring.\nFlush the channel with M9 buffer a few times to remove bacteria. Rinse the flow channel with 70% ethyl alcohol (diluted in distilled water). Dry the channels by pushing air using a syringe. Store the device in a dry dust-free place for repeated use in the future.\nImage analysis and statistics\n\t\nUse FIJI ImageJ software for tiff image analysis. Open tiff images of the PVD time-lapse images from the wdIs51 animals in Fiji ImageJ. Extract the best planes from the stack of z-planes showing the primary processes by selecting Image tab > Stacks > Z project.\nScreen the entire series of images and find specific image frames that successfully cover the entire neuronal processes using overlapping sections of the animal image frames. Select Plugin > Analyze > Cell Counter from the FIJI toolbar. This will open a window for numbering different branches and keeping a count of each selected neuron.\nSelect Initialize > Counters > Type1, then mark the secondary branches. Then select Type 2 and mark Quaternary, click Results window showing counts of all branches (Supplementary Figure 2). This method will display the branches that are already counted.",
    "Open the next overlapping image and count the remaining branches. This process will prevent double counting and ensure every process is counted. Identify and count the total number of primary branches present in the early larval stages of C. elegans. Perform similar analysis for the images for secondary and quaternary processes in older animals.\n\t\tNOTE: Adults show many processes that innervate in body wall muscles and can be difficult to count. Ensure that every process is counted only once.\nCalculate the distance between the PVD cell bodies in the wdIs51 animals by drawing a segmented line from the PVD cell body (CB) to PVC CB. For larval 4 (L4) stage animals, the cell bodies are far apart and are not in the same frame when imaged with a 60x objective.\nSelect overlapping images from stack to cover the entire animal length from head-to-tail using Image tab > Stacks > Z project from ImageJ. Draw segmented lines along the neuronal process between the PVD and PVC CBs.\nMeasure the lengths for all the segmented lines using ImageJ > Analyze > Measure. Add the lengths for all the segments to calculate the total distance between PVD and PVC CBs for each time point.\nFor neuron length of TRNs in jsIs609 animals, load the images in Fiji. Draw a segmented line along the posterior lateral microtubules (PLMs; visible with soluble GFP) from the cell body to the centroid of the first mitochondrion. Calculate the length of the line for the first distance value.\nDraw a segmented line from the center of the first to the second mitochondrion. Repeat this process for each pair of mitochondria till the end of neuronal process length. Add all the lengths to calculate the total neuronal process length.",
    "For the cell lineage analysis, load all the vulval images in Fiji and extract the best focus image of the cells from the time-lapse images of multiple z-planes.\nRepresent the data as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Calculate statistical significance using one-way ANOVA for more than two samples or a two-sample t-test for a pair of samples. Denote significance by p-value < 0.05 (*), p-value < 0.005 (**), and p-value > 0.05 (ns, not significant).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
