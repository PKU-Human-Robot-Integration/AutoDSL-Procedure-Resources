    "The procedure is performed in accordance with standard of care expectations and follows the guidelines of the human research ethics committee at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n1. Pre-operative Preparation\nReview prior chest computed tomography (CT) imaging to ensure that the patient undergoing nodule localization has a peripheral pulmonary nodule suitable for minimally invasive thoracic surgery (MITS).\nOn the day of or a day prior to the procedure, perform a noncontrast chest CT scan with the patient in the lateral decubitus position with the lung ipsilateral to the nodule positioned up to mimic the position during the dye injection. Obtain both expiratory and inspiratory images to account for nodule movement.\n\tNOTE: The CT should be formatted per EMTTNL system specifications7.\nUse the navigation system planning software to digitally segment the target lesion.\nIf the target lesion is radiographically \"pure\" ground-glass in nature, the segmentation software may fail to properly identify the lesion. In this case, place a virtual target in the center of the target lesion.\nOnce the target lesion has been successfully marked, use the planning software to delineate the percutaneous site for needle entry. The percutaneous entry site should be located between two ribs, taking care to avoid the intercostal neurovascular bundle on the inferior border of the rib, and represent the shortest track from skin entry to nodule acquisition.\n2. Peri-operative Preparation and Registration\nTransfer the patient to the operating room and have the appropriate personnel induce general anesthesia with paralysis.\n\tNOTE: General anesthesia should be only administered by certified personnel and the dosing of the drugs is at the discretion of the anesthesia provider.",
    "Once anesthesia and paralysis have been achieved (as confirmed by the loss of muscle tone and the cessation of spontaneous chest wall motion), establish an orally inserted airway using a double lumen endotracheal tube (DL-ETT) as opposed to a traditional single lumen endotracheal tube.\n\tNOTE: This is placed by the anesthesia providers, and any size required based on the patient's specifications is acceptable. This will allow for procedural positioning, single-lung ventilation for the surgical resection and EMN system registration.\nPerform a white light bronchoscopy (WLB) examination of the tracheobronchial tree to the segmental level, assessing for occult endobronchial disease.\nAfter performing a WLB examination of the airway, position the patient in the lateral decubitus position, mirroring as closely as possible the patient's positioning during CT. Attach three electronic reference point pads to the patient's chest, placing them on the ipsilateral chest wall to the nodule and out of the way of the chosen point of entry (Figure 2).\n\t\nFor example, if the chosen point of entry is the left anterior thorax, place the pads on the left chest, at least 5 cm away from the point of entry. Then, plug the pads into the EMN system.\nPerform system registration for the patient with system calibration by first positioning the EMN field generator over the reference pads. Fine-tune the position using prompts provided by the EMN system. Once the field generator is in position, using the EMTTNL platform, take a virtual \"snapshot\" of the reference pads.",
    "Following the snapshot, insert the proprietary EMN-tracked disposable scope catheter (DSC, 3.2 mm in outer diameter, working channel 2.0) into each lumen of the DL-ETT in order to generate a data point cloud delineating the extent of the main airways (Figure 3). Align the catheter on the main carina and, then, pull back slowly into the trachea until prompted by the system to stop (green checkmark). Then, drive the DSC into the right lung-specifically, the right lower lob-until prompted to stop (green checkmark).\nOnce the data point collection is halted, remove the DSC from the right lung lumen of the DL-ETT and insert it into the left lung lumen of the tube. Drive the DSC into the left mainstem bronchus 2 - 3 cm proximal to its bifurcation into the left upper and lower lobes. Resume the data collection at this point and drive the DSC into the left lower lobe until prompted to stop (green checkmark). Once the full data point cloud is collected, proceed to EMTTNL.\n3. Procedure\nAlign a tracked percutaneous needle at the chest wall skin entry site using the EMN platform for guidance. Mark the skin at the entry point to the chest cavity, taking care that the entry point should be just superior to the rib and avoid any known vasculature or osseous structures (e.g., clavicle, subclavian vessels).\nClean and prepare the skin with a 2% chlorhexidine solution for a minimum of 15 s and allow it to dry for a minimum of 30 s. Drape the field using sterile technique.",
    "Once a sterile field has been created, don sterile gloves and a sterile gown and inject 1 - 2 mL of 1% lidocaine subcutaneously at the entry point for local anesthesia. Use a #10 blade surgical scalpel to make a superficial skin incision (5 mm) at the entry site through the epidermis.\nPlace the sterile 19-G electromagnetic needle on the marked entry point. Using the transverse and coronal views on the electromagnetic system screen, adjust the angle of entry so that it lines up with the center of the target lesion (Figure 4).\n\tNOTE: Crosshair markings should overlap in at least two different planes.\nOnce the angle of entry is confirmed, stabilize the EMN-tracked needle against the chest wall and firmly advance through the chest wall, while the anesthesia team holds the patient in exhalation. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is maintained at 5 cm of water.\nOnce reaching the distal side (from the chest wall) of the target lesion, remove the tracked stylet without moving the needle and cover the needle hub with a finger. Use extreme caution so as to not dislodge the needle. If, at any time during the following steps, there is concern about needle movement, reinsert the tracked stylet to confirm needle placement.\nTo the needle, connect a syringe containing either 2 - 3 mL of undiluted methylene blue, or 2 - 3 mL of a 1:1 mixture of methylene blue and the patient's blood.\n\tNOTE: The patient's blood should be drawn just prior to mixing it to minimize clotting and can be drawn off with either a peripheral IV or from a fresh needle venipuncture. The mixture is recommended as it thickens the solution and limits dye diffusion and/or \"splashing\" of dye within the pleural space during needle retraction.",
    "Inject 0.5 mL of the dye or the dye:blood mix within the target lesion. Gradually and continuously deposit another 0.5 mL of the dye or the dye:blood mixture while slowly withdrawing the needle to create a track.\n4. Post Procedure\nAfter EMTTNL (Figure 3), perform MITS using the dye marking to localize and resect the lung nodule19,20,21,22,23.\n\tNOTE: Post-procedure patient care will be at the discretion of the thoracic surgeon as this protocol does not have any specific post-operative requirements.\nSubscription Required.
