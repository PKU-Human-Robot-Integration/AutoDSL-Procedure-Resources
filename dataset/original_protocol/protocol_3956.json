    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of home-made E8 medium\nTiming: 30 min\nPreparation of 500 mL E8 medium\nThe components of E8 medium are: DMEM/F12, NaHCO3, 2-Phospho-L-ascorbic acid trisodium salt, sodium selenite, FGF2, TGF-β1, insulin, and transferrin. The concentrations of E8 medium components are listed in Materials and equipment.\nFor more details on E8 medium preparation and stem cell culture maintenance, please refer to Chen et al. (2011a)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] and Beers et al. (2012)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]. For metabolic analysis in the same set of samples, the same batch of medium should be used.\nPreparation of Matrigel-coated plate\nTiming: 2 days for step 2\nTiming: 30 min for step 3\nAlternatives: Commercial Matrigel pre-coated plates may also be used. For example: Corning® BioCoat™ Matrigel® Matrix 6-well clear flat bottom TC-treated multiwell plate (Cat#354432). For metabolic analysis in chemically defined conditions, vitronectin or other coating substrates could be used in place of Matrigel.\nPreparation of Matrigel aliquots\nOne day before the experiment, thaw 1 bottle of Matrigel on ice for 12–24 h and pre-chill empty 2-mL Eppendorf tubes in −80°C refrigerator.\nAliquot 2 mg Matrigel into each pre-chilled 2-mL Eppendorf tube, and freeze immediately in −80°C refrigerator.\nStore aliquoted Matrigel at −80°C. One tube of 2 mg Matrigel will be used to coat six cell culture plates.\nPreparation of Matrigel-coated cell culture plates\nNote: Pre-chill DMEM/F12 at 4°C for at least 1 h.\nDilute 2 mg of aliquoted Matrigel in 36 mL cold DMEM/F12.\nCritical: Be quick at this step.\nAliquot 1 mL of diluted Matrigel into each well of a 6-well plate. Scale down for other sizes of plates. Gently shake the plate till the medium covers the whole surface without air bubble. 2 mg of Matrigel can be used to coat 6 multi-well plates.",
    "Note: 0.5 mL/well diluted Matrigel for 12-well plates; 0.25 mL/well diluted Matrigel for 24-well plates.\nLeave the plate in a 37°C incubator for at least 30 min before use.\nPause point: Coated plates can be wrapped with foil and stored in 4°C for up to 1 week.\nNote: Medium remaining in the coated plate will continuously evaporate even at 4°C. Avoid using the plate if part of the culturing surface has dried.\nRecovery of human ES/iPS cells from frozen stock\nTiming: 20 min\nRecovery of human ES/iPS cells\nTake a Matrigel-coated 6-well plate. Aspirate medium from the wells you plan to use, and then add 2 mL/well E8 medium containing 10 μM Y-27632.\nNote: (Optional) The plate with E8 medium can be put into the incubator to pre-equilibrate for 30 min.\nPrepare a 37°C water bath.\nTake the cryotube with frozen cell stock out of liquid nitrogen tank and put it directly in the 37°C water bath.\nCritical: When there is only a small ice particle floating, transfer the tube into a biosafety cabinet.\nTransfer cells into a 15-mL conical tube. Drop-wisely add 10 mL E8 medium + 10 μM Y-27632, while continuously mixing the solution.\nPellet cells by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant, resuspend the cells with 1 mL E8 + 10 μM Y-27632, and then gently seed into the wells of Matrigel-coated plate containing E8 (step 4a above).\nChange medium daily by aspirating the spent medium and adding 2 mL fresh E8.\nWhen cells reach 60–70% confluence, passage the cells following the steps below. If the survival is not good, passage cells after 5–6 days regardless of the confluence.\nPassaging and maintenance of human ES/iPS cells\nTiming: 30 min for step 5\nTiming: 30 min for step 6",
    "Passaging of human ES/iPS cells with DPBS-EDTA solution\nTake a Matrigel-coated 6-well plate. Aspirate the remaining medium and add 2 mL E8 medium containing 5 μM Y-27632 in each well.\nNote: (Optional) The plate with E8 medium can be put into the incubator to pre-equilibrate for 30 min.\nFor cells maintained in 6-well plates that need to be passaged, remove the spent medium, and rinse cells twice by adding 1 mL/well DPBS-EDTA solution and aspirating the solution without incubation.\nCritical: Be careful when rinsing cells and aspirating EDTA to avoid losing cells.\nAdd 1 mL DPBS-EDTA solution per well, and incubate in 37°C incubator for 5 min.\nNote: The optimal incubation time depends on the cell line. 5–10 min of incubation works for most cell lines.\nAspirate the DPBS-EDTA solution. Harvest cells with 1 mL of E8 medium + 5 μM Y-27632 by pipetting up and down.\nTake the desired amount of cell suspension and seed the cells into the Matrigel-coated plate containing E8 medium and 5 μM Y-27632 (step 5a).\nNote: The passaging ratio depends on the cell line and experimental design. For H1/H9 hESCs, 1:6 passaging is conducted for maintenance.\nGently shake the plate until cells are evenly distributed. Put the plate in a 37°C incubator with 5% CO2.\nThe next day, change medium to 2 mL/well E8 medium without ROCK inhibitor.\nMaintenance of human ES/iPS cells\nCritical: For metabolic analysis, it is recommended to equibilize E8 medium in 37°C incubator with loosened lid for 15 min before medium change.\nCulture medium is usually changed every day. For one well of a 6-well plate, aspirate the spent medium and add 2 mL fresh E8 medium.\nCells are passaged every 3–4 days when the confluence is about 70%. Avoid over-confluence of cell culture.",
    "Note: ROCK inhibitor is usually added during cell passaging and removed after 24 h.\nHuman ES/iPS cell preparation for metabolite detection\nDay 0\nTiming: 30 min\nSeed enough cells into 6-well plates for LC-MS analysis as described above (step 5). Prepare 8 wells for each treatment. Five wells of cells will be collected individually as five replicates, and additional 3 wells will be used to determine cell number for normalization. Multiple plates will be needed.\nNote: The minimum number of cells required for metabolomic profiling is 1 million. When H1/H9 hESCs reach ∼80% confluence, the cell number in each well of a 6-well plate is over one million. This number may vary for different cell lines. It is important to avoid over-confluence of culture, so cells need to be monitored under microscope daily.\nCritical: Cell number is important for normalization. Before metabolic analysis, multiple rounds of experiments are often conducted to evaluate the impact of specific treatment on cell proliferation. As an alternative approach for normalization, cellular protein concentration from each well may also be used as internal control. However, if albumin or FBS is used in cell culture, it is important to make sure that exogenous proteins are rinsed off effectively before protein measurement.\nDay 1\nTiming: 10 min\nChange medium. For 6-well plates, add 2 mL fresh E8 medium per well. Add appropriate treatments.\nNote: Treatment period is flexible depending on the experiment design. Medium should be changed every day until the day of metabolite analysis. In our experiments, medium is collected for extraction 24 h after the final medium change.\nCritical: Avoid over-confluence of cells.\nDay 2\nTiming: 1 h",
    "Count cells. When cells are ready for metabolic analysis, collect 3 wells of cells from each condition for cell count determination. Aspirate medium and add 500 μL/well TrypLE Select, incubate in 37°C for 5 min, and neutralize with 500 μL 5% FBS in DMEM/F12. Determine the cell count using a hemocytometer or flow cytometer.\nNote: Metabolic data is normalized to cell number or protein level.\nMedium collection for metabolic analysis\nTiming: 1 h\nCollect medium and extract with medium extraction solution (see Materials and equipment).\nTransfer 1 mL culture medium from each well to a 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube. Spin at 1,000 x g for 5 min.\nTransfer 100 μL of the supernatant into a new 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube. Add 900 μL medium extraction solution (nine volumes) and vortex.\nSpin at 18,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min. Take 200 μL supernatant for LC-MS analysis.\nCell collection for metabolic analysis\nTiming: 1 h\nTiming: 1 h for step 14\nPut 0.9% saline and labeled tubes on ice. Make sure cell scrapers and cell extraction solution (see Materials and equipment) are pre-chilled at −80°C.\nCritical: To ensure effective quenching, keep the cell extraction solution in −80°C until use. We advise to prepare two bottles of cell extraction solution. Take one bottle out of the freezer for use with one plate, put it back immediately and then take the other bottle for the next plate. Try to decrease the time the extraction solution is left at room temperature (15°C–30°C).",
    "Critical: Perform the rinse quickly to avoid interference with results. Rinsing with saline is to remove residual medium and floating cell debris. However, it is reported that the rinsing procedure itself could significantly affect determination of metabolites (Ser et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). Our data also validated that washing cells with saline could decrease signal intensities of metabolites (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). But considering that components in residual medium would lead to distortion of quantification, the washing procedure is retained in this protocol.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/923-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Impact of extraction procedures on quantification\nH1 cells (1 million) were washed twice with 0.9% saline and then extracted as instructed in Method 1 (saline wash), or directly quenched by −80°C cell extraction solution after spent medium is aspirated (W/O wash). Ovnight incubation at −80°C (−80°C, 12 h) was also compared to immediate quantification (saline wash). Data are shown as mean ± SD, n = 5.\nMethod 1 (for amino acids and intermediates in glycolysis, PPP and TCA cycle):\nRinse cells with 1 mL/well ice-cold 0.9% saline twice.\nAspirate the saline and add 500 μL/well cold cell extraction solution (kept in −80°C). Scrape off cells by cell scraper and transfer the suspension into a labeled, pre-chilled 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube (Tube 1). Put tubes on ice.\nCritical: To ensure a correct volume, use a new pipette tip to add the cold cell extraction solution into each well.\nWash the well with 100 μL cell extraction solution and combine it into Tube 1.\nPause point: Sample in Tube 1 can be stored in −80°C fridge for 24 h (see Note after step 12d).\nVortex each sample. Centrifuge at 18,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Transfer the supernatant into a new 1.5-mL tube (Tube 2). Put tubes on ice.",
    "Note: The pellet could be preserved to measure protein concentration as described below (step 14).\nNote: After step 12d, Tube 2 could be preserved at −80°C for 24 h. This 24 h preservation was evaluated in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]. Peak intensities of most metabolites were comparable with or without 24 h-storage. Because of the risk of losing metabolites caused by storage, we recommend immediate LC-MS analysis after extraction. Long term storage of extracted metabolites, even in −80°C refrigerator, should be avoided.\nVortex Tube 2, put tube on ice, and then transfer 200 μL extract into a sample vial for LC-MS analysis.\nMethod 2 (for lipid determination):\nCritical: To avoid plastic contamination, glass vials are recommended. Polypropylene pipette tip is conditionally resistant to chloroform for a minimized contact time. A fresh tip must be used each time chloroform is dispensed.\nPut Milli-Q water and labeled glass vials on ice. Make sure methanol and chloroform containing 1 μg/mL heptadecanoate and 1 μg/mL coprostan-3-ol (see Materials and equipment) are pre-chilled at −80°C.\nNote: Heptadecanoate is used as internal control for fatty acids. coprostan-3-ol is used as internal control for cholesterol.\nRinse cells with 1 mL/well ice-cold 0.9% saline twice.\nAspirate the saline. Add 250 μL/well −80°C methanol and then add 100 μL/well ice-cold Milli-Q water.\nScrape off cells and transfer the suspension into glass vials. Put vials on ice.\nAdd 250 μL/vial −80°C chloroform containing 1 μg/mL heptadecanoate and 1 μg/mL coprostan-3-ol. Vortex and then centrifuge at 18,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove the upper hydrophilic phase. Protein pellet at the interface is carefully pushed aside on the wall of the vial. A fresh tip is used to reach the bottom of the vial to collect the hydrophobic phase. Stop collecting before reaching the interface.",
    "Transfer the hydrophobic phase into a new glass vial. Evaporate under nitrogen gas till dry. Re-dissolve the residue in 100 μL 2:1 chloroform/methanol (v/v) for LC-MS analysis.\nCritical: Nitrogen but not regular air is used to dry samples, because lipids, especially unsaturated lipids are easily oxidized. The time of nitrogen blowdown is mainly affected by the amount of water in the sample.\nDetermine protein mass (optional)\nDecant supernatant and add 200 μL methanol to the protein pellet. Vigorously vortex and then centrifuge at 18,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDecant the supernatant into waste. Let the protein pellet dry by putting the tube upside down on a Kimwipe in a biological safety cabinet for 5 min.\nDissolve the protein pellet with 400 μL protein denaturing solution (see Materials and equipment).\nBicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit is used to quantify the protein concentration. Bovine serum albumin standard (2 mg/mL) is diluted to a series of concentrations in 1X PBS, typically 0.1–1 mg/mL, to construct a standard curve.\nPrepare the working reagent as instructed by the BCA kit manual. Samples in urea are diluted 1/10. Mix diluted samples or BSA standards with the working reagent in a 96-well microplate.\nCritical: The BCA assay is compatible with up to 3 M urea, so appropriate dilution of the protein pellet dissolved in protein denaturing solution (8 M urea + 100 mM NH4HCO3) is necessary.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C for 30 min, and then check absorptance at 562 nm by a spectrophotometer.\nUse the standard curve to determine the protein concentration of each sample.\nLC-MS warm up\nTiming: ∼1 h\nCalibrate the mass spectrometer following manufacturer’s recommendation. For the Waters TQD used in this protocol, use IntelliStart software to automatically tune and mass calibrate the instrument.",
    "Make sure mobile phases and system wash solution are sufficient.\nInstall the UPLC column. For example, install HILIC column for the quantification of metabolites involved in glycolysis as described in Run LC-MS section.\nPurge the system with mobile phases. In this protocol, two bottles of mobile phases are used for the methods, purge each bottle of mobile phase at 4 mL/min for 4 min. Equilibrate the column with initial gradient and flow rate until delta pressure (maximum pressure minus minimum pressure) is below 30 psi.\nCheck LC and MS performance. Check column pressure, and take a record of the column pressure after equilibration. An increase of over 300 psi in column pressure could be considered as abnormal increase. Wash the column as instructed if abnormal column pressure increase happens.\nRun LC-MS\nTiming: 2 days\nTiming: 20 min/sample for step 20\nTiming: 10 min/sample for step 21\nTiming: 10 min/sample for step 22\nTiming: 15 min/sample for step 23\nTiming: 15 min/sample for step 24\nNote: Waters Xevo TQD coupled with Waters Acquity UPLC system is used for quantification in this protocol, though other LC-MS systems with similar capabilities can be used. The MS parameters are listed in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_923_14.csv\nNote: Polarity is important for the column separation of metabolites. Different metabolites are acquired using different polarity.\nAs shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], multiple MRM settings of each standard compound were tested during method development. Retention time of one compound in different MRM channels should be aligned, which excludes peaks at other retention time. The MRM setting which generates the most intense response is selected for later quantification.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/923-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Examples of amino acid chromatograms",
    "Different MRM settings for twenty amino acids were shown as examples of how the MRM is set in this protocol. To establish an MRM setting, multiple daughter ions are used for the same parent ion, the elution time of different daughter ions should be the same, and the one with the highest response is used for later quantification.\nQuality control (QC) sample is prepared by mixing equal volumes of all samples. It is recommended to run the QC sample six times at the beginning of the sample sequence and subsequently inject the QC sample after every 5–10 sample injections. QC sample is used to verify the performance of LC-MS.\nProgram 1: For the quantification of norvaline, amino acids, GSH, GSSG, SAH, SAM, ascorbic acid and myo-inositol.
