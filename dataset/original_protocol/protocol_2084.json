    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThaw and prepare samples for staining\nTiming: 20 min\nHere, frozen samples are used to generate a single-cell suspension for staining. If the cells were not previously frozen, steps 3–5 should be skipped.\nWarm media and serum-free media to 37°C using a water bath.\nNote: The media recipes are in the “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]” section.\nPrepare a beaker with bleach for liquid waste.\nNote: The amount of bleach should be enough so that the end volume has at least 10% bleach.\nLabel 15 mL conical tubes for the samples, which will be added.\nAdd 9 mL of media into the labeled 15 mL conical tubes.\nThaw the samples and quench the freezing media.\nPlace the cryovials into the 37°C water bath for about a min or until about 80% thawed.\nTransfer the thawed cell suspensions into the labels 15 mL conical tubes.\nCritical: Once thawed, frozen cell must be transfer quickly to media to minimize toxic exposure to DMSO.\nCentrifuge the cell suspensions for 5 min at 300 × g.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend in 1 mL of medium.\nCount the cells using a hemacytometer.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 300 × g and discard supernatant.\nResuspend the cells at 2 × 107 cells/mL of warm serum-free media.\nCisplatin (cell viability) staining\nTiming: 30 min\nCisplatin is used for identifying dead cells during data analysis.\nPrepare 10 uM (2×) Cell-ID™ Cisplatin working solution.\nThaw Cell-ID™ Cisplatin stock aliquot to 25°C.\nAdd 2 μL of 5 mM (1,000×) Cell-ID™ Cisplatin stock to 998 μL of warm serum-free media.",
    "Note: The volumes listed for the preparation of the 10 uM (2×) Cell-ID™ Cisplatin working solution are there as an example. The volume necessary will vary based on the volume of the sample cell suspension. It is recommended to prepare approximately 10% more 10 uM (2×) Cell-ID™ Cisplatin working solution than the volume of the sample cell suspension to account for error.\nAdd an equal volume of the 10 μM Cell-ID™ Cisplatin working solution to the cell suspension solution making a final Cell-ID™ Cisplatin concentration of 5 μM (1×). Pipette to mix well.\nIncubate for 5 min at 25°C.\nQuench by adding warmed media at 5× the volume of the stained cells.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant. Resuspend the pellet in 4 mL of Maxpar® Cell Staining Buffer.\nCount the cells using a hemacytometer.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells at a concentration of 1–3 million cells in 50 μL of Maxpar® Cell Staining Buffer.\nTransfer the cells to 5 mL polypropylene tubes.\nFc receptor blocking and surface antibody staining\nTiming: 1 h 45 min\nHere, Fc receptors are blocked to prevent non-specific binding of receptors to the constant domain (Fc region) of the antibodies. The antibodies are then added to bind and label the targeted cell surface molecules.\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 × g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant.\n50 μL of Fc Block is prepared per sample by diluting the lanthanide-conjugated anti-CD16/32 antibody at the appropriate concentration determined by the titration.\nNote: The Fc Block solution can be prepared during the previous centrifugation step to save time.\nResuspend the pellet in 50 μL of Fc Block (anti-CD16/32 antibody solution).\nIncubate at 25°C for 10 min.",
    "To prepare the surface antibody master mix, add the surface antibodies shown in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] (in this case, all antibodies except anti-CD206 and anti-Gr-1) to Maxpar® Cell Staining Buffer to make 50 μL of antibody solution per sample.\nNote: The volume of each antibody used for the master mix is based on the concentration determined by the titration (refer to the “titration of antibodies and assessing signal spillover[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3]” section).\nNote: CD206 is stained during the intracellular staining process. Anti-Gr-1 recognizes both Ly6G and Ly6C at different binding sites than either clone of the Ly6G and Ly6C antibodies used in this panel. However, to avoid any potential steric hindrance, it is recommended to do sequential staining for anti-Ly6G and anti-Ly6C, followed by anti-Gr-1.\nAdd 50 μL of surface antibody master mix to the Fc Block-cell suspension. Gently pipette to mix.\nIncubate for 30 min total at 25°C, gently vortexing the tubes at the 15 min halfway point.\nPrepare anti-Gr-1 antibody at 2× the recommended concentration determined by the titration.\nAdd 50 μL of anti-Gr-1 and incubate for an additional 30 min at 25°C, gently vortexing the tubes at the 15 min halfway point.\nWash the cells.\nAdd 2 mL of Cell Staining Buffer.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min.\nDiscard supernatant.\nRepeat the wash for a total of 2 washes.\nFixing and intracellular antibody staining\nTiming: 2 h\nThe cells are fixed and permeabilized to allow for entry of the intracellular antigens staining antibodies, which then bind to and label the targeted intracellular antigens.\nGently vortex to resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of 1× Maxpar® Fix I Buffer.\nIncubate for 30 min at 25°C to fix the cells.",
    "During incubation, make 100 μL intercellular antibody master mix per sample by adding the intracellular antibodies to Maxpar® Perm-S Buffer. In this case, anti-CD206 is the only antibody used for intracellular labeling.\nNote: The volume of each antibody used for the master mix is based on the concentration determined by the titration (refer to the “titration of antibodies and assessing signal spillover[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3]” section).\nNote: If the intracellular target is a transcription factor or an intranuclear protein, it is recommended to perform the permeabilization using the Maxpar® Nuclear Antigen Staining Buffer Set (Fluidigm, Cat# 201063).\nWash the cells.\nAdd 2 mL of Maxpar® Perm-S Buffer.\nCentrifuge at 800 × g for 5 min.\nDiscard supernatant.\nRepeat the wash for a total of 2 washes.\nGently resuspend the pellet in 100 μL of intracellular antibody stain.\nIncubate for 30 min at 25°C.\nWash the cells two more times as done in step 34.\nFresh fix and DNA intercalator staining\nTiming: 45 min, left overnight (12–18 h)\nIn this step, the cells are stained with DNA intercalator, which allows for downstream identification of cell singlets. As DNA intercalator binds to nucleic acids, and cell-cell doublets have more DNA, doublets have a stronger DNA intercalator signal than singlets.\nPrepare 1 mL of 1.6% paraformaldehyde (PFA) per sample from the 16% Paraformaldehyde Aqueous Solution with Maxpar® PBS.\nNote: The 1.6% paraformaldehyde solution should be prepared fresh before use.Resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of 1.6% PFA.\nIncubate for 20 min at 25°C.\nNote: Fixation is a very important step to allow entry of the DNA intercalator into the nucleus. Fixation also preserves the cells from the hypotonic solution (deionized H2O) used during data acquisition.\nCentrifuge at 800 × g for 5 min. Discard supernatant.\nGently vortex to resuspend the pellet in the residual solution.",
    "Prepare 1 mL intercalation solution per sample by diluting 125 uM Cell-ID™ Intercalator (1,000×) stock solution to 125 nM (1×) with Maxpar® Fix and Perm Buffer.\nNote: This solution can be prepared during the centrifugation in step 41 to save time.\nAdd 1 mL of the 1× intercalation solution and gently vortex to mix.\nIncubate overnight (12–18 h) at 4°C to label the nucleated cells.\nPause point: The cells can be left up to 2 days at 4°C until acquisition.\nSample acquisition on CyTOF® instrument\nTiming: 1 day (3–4 h per sample)\nIt is important to run the samples along with Fluidigm’s EQ™ Four Element Calibration Beads, which allow for changes during sample acquisition to be monitored. The steps for sample acquisition and monitoring are as follow:\nWash the cells.\nAdd 3 mL of Maxpar® Cell Staining Buffer.\nCentrifuge at 800 × g for 5 min.\nDiscard supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in 1 mL of Milli-Q water and count the cells.\nAdd an additional 3 mL to wash the cells and centrifuge at 800 × g for 5 min.\nResuspend the pelleted cells with Milli-Q water containing 0.1× EQ™ Four Element Calibration Beads (diluted from 1× stock bottle) according to cell count to achieve 8–10 × 105 cells/mL.\nFilter cells with a 40 μm cell strainer prior to introduction into the Helios™, a CyTOF® System.\nNote: Changes in sample acquisition can happen due to variations in instrument performance. Because of these variations in instrument performance, quality control of the instrument before and during sample acquisition is essential.",
    "Note: This protocol focuses on the preparation and staining of cell suspensions along with the analysis of mass cytometry data. The process of acquiring the sample data is beyond the scope of this protocol. As such, samples should be submitted to a mass cytometry core specifically trained to run the samples for data acquisition.\nNormalization\nTiming: 1 h\nData normalization is crucial to minimize technical variation. This process can be performed using the Fluidigm CyTOF® software, which uses a standard “Bead passport” with standardized target values for the calibration beads. Using this tool, a bead’s signal is detected and recorded throughout the sample acquisition, and the median intensity is calculated within a user-defined time interval. By assuming a linear rate of signal decay, the rate constant of signal decay in each interval is calculated against the global mean of signal intensity. Every event within the specified interval is multiplied by the rate constant.\nUsing the CyTOF® software, select the raw FCS file, choose the “Process” tab, and select FCS processing.\nSelect the corresponding bead passport to the EQ™ Four Element Calibration Beads lot number used in data acquisition.\nSelect the time interval that the normalization factor will be applied to.\nNote: By default, the software will use a 100 s interval.\nNote: Another method of normalization was developed by the Nolan lab to mitigate the impact of signal drift on the data.\nConcatenation (optional)\nTiming: 1 h\nSample acquisition may need to be run in various rounds because of the volume of the sample or a change in system performance during acquisition, such as a clog or unexpected shutdown. This results in multiple FCS files for a single sample which can then be concatenated into a single file.",
    "In the CyTOF® Software, select the FCS processing tab. Then select the raw FCS files to concatenate.\nClick on the “concatenate” tab. The concatenated FCS file will be generated and ready for export.\nCritical: Make sure that the original data box is checked.\nCritical: Route the name and the directory of the new concatenated file. The normalization process will take place automatically once you concatenate.\nNote: Instead of the CyTOF® software, concatenation may be performed using Cytobank. However, data must be normalized before using this tool."
