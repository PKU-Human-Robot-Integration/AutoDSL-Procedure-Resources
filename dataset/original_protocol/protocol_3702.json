This protocol requires a starting population of hPSCs colonies in a 6 well plate format to be in 75%–85% confluency. A single cell solution is required to prepare the hPSCs for differentiation into the three cell types required for the liver spheroid aggregation.

This protocol generates a non-homogeneous endothelial cell population ranging from 41% to 64% purity. To ensure a pure > 90% population of CD144/CD31 positive endothelial cells, magnetic cell separation (MACS) enrichment for CD144 is required.

    "This step describes how to prepare the 96-well plate Gri3D® for cell seeding. Each well of a 96-well plate Gri3D contains a Polyethylene glycol (PEG)- hydrogel with 73 micromolds of 500 μM of diameter. Upon adding a single-cell suspension in the wells, cells will be deposited into the micromolds by gravity where they will start to self-assemble into spheroids. Each well of the Gri3D plates, contains a feeder cavity or well which can be used for media change to reduce spheroid disruption (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). Wells need to be washed prior spheroid formation to remove shipping buffer. By using automatic liquid handling systems, semi-automation of this process can be achieved. For this protocol we use both Multidop (Thermofisher) and Viaflo (Integra) systems. First, the multidrop is a high-speed dispenser compatible with 6- to 1536-well plates, it works by dispensing specific volumes into the wells in a column-based manner using dispensing cassettes which can vary depending on the volume to dispense, in our protocol we use standard dispensing cassettes. The Viaflo is a handheld 24, 96 or 384 channel programmable pipette that allows an increase throughput when working with multi-well plates. The Viaflo can be used with either a two- or three-plate station. The usage of the three-plate station minimizes the risk of contamination by reducing the need of changing plates when working under sterile conditions.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/629-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic representation of the sphere production pipeline\n(A) Schematic representation of a well of a Gri3D_ plate.",
    "(B) Suggested use of the Viaflo plate station. Position 1 – for the 96-well plate Gri3D_ with the microwells (feeder wells) facing left. Position 2 - for a 96- deep well plate for the waste collection. Position 3 – for the ‘V’-shape plate with the cell suspension. Position 4 – for accessing the feeder well by moving the pin to the left.\nPlace the 96-well plate Gri3D® into one of the plate holders of a three station Viaflo with a 96 well head. Place the plate with the A1 well facing the top left, the microwells or feeder wells should be facing left at this position (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). Place a 96-deep well plate into the next position of the station and use it as a waste.\nPrepare a 96-deep well plate with 900 μL of DPBS per well for Gri3D® plate to be prepared. This will serve as a reservoir of DPBS to wash three times the Gri3D® plates to prepare them for cell culture. Place the deep well plate with DPBS into the last Viaflo station available.\nNote: The use of a multidrop with a standard cassette to dispense the DPBS into the deep well can reduce time and variability.\nPosition the Viaflo head in the Gri3D® plate position, move the pin of the plate holder to the left to work in a 384-well plate mode. This mode should align the tips with the microwell of the 96-well plate Gri3D®.\nTo remove all the shipment buffer from the wells, aspirate 300 μL from the feeder well. Move the Viaflo head into the central position (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) where the waste deep-well plate for waste is placed. Pin back to center to work in a 96-well plate mode and dispense the liquid into the waste plate.",
    "Move the plate station to the right for the Viaflo to access the plate with DPBS. Aspirate 250 μL. Move the plate station to the right and move the pin to the left to work in a 384-well plate mode. Place the tips into the feeder well and dispense the 250 μL into the feeder well. Mix up and down 100 μL five times to ensure any reminder of the buffer from the Gri3D® plate is mixed with the DPBS.\nThis process is considered a wash, repeat it two more times to ensure full removal of the Gri3D® plate.\nNote: The volume DPBS dispensed into the deep-well should cover the three washes.\nAfter the last wash, leave the DPBS into the plate and place it into the incubator at 37°C/5% CO2 to warm up the hydrogel from Gri3D® plate until the cell suspension for liver sphere aggregation is prepared.\nAutomated liver sphere aggregation using 96-well plate Gri3D® plates\nTiming: 4 h\nCritical: The three different cell lines need to be differentiated in parallel to achieve the last day of the differentiation to be ready to process on the day of the liver sphere aggregation (see also Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nThis step describes how to prepare the cell suspension with the three cell types for the liver sphere aggregation using the 96-well plate Gri3D® in combination with the MultiDrop and Viaflo (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). For liver spheroid aggregation, the optimal cell ratio is 10:3:1 (HB:ELC:HSC). Each well contains 73 micromolds and each sphere contains 3000 HB, 900 ELC and 300 HSC at the time of seeding. The cell density required for each cell type is described in the previous sections. The total volume needed per well is 40 μL but preparation of 60 μL per well is recommended.

As an example, to prepare a full 96-well plate, mix 3000 μL of HB with 1500 μL of ELC and 1500 μL of HSC.\nNote: Aggregation of liver spheres without ELC or HSC can be achieved by replacing the volume of the specific cell type within liver sphere medium supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632, 10 ng/mL EGF, 10 ng/mL FGF, 10 ng/mL HGF, 20 ng/mL OSM and 50 ng/mL VEGF. Liver function and long-term stability will be affected if ELC or HSC are removed.\nUsing the multidrop with a standard cassette, prime the cell solution until ready to dispense.

Place a 96-deep well plate into the position 2 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) and use it as a waste and the ‘V’-shape plate with the cell suspension in the position 3 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nPosition the Viaflo head in the Gri3D® plate position, move the pin of the plate holder to the left to work in a 384-well plate mode. This mode should align the tips with the microwell of the 96-well plate Gri3D®.\nAspirate 300 μL to remove all the media from the feeder well. Move the Viaflo head into the central position where the waste deep-well plate is placed. Pin back to center to work in a 96-well plate mode and dispense the liquid into the waste plate. Remove any remaining liquid from the wells without damaging the hydrogel by touching it with the pipette tips and dispense the liquid into the waste plate.\nMove the plate station to the right for the Viaflo to access the plate with the cells.

Move down to touch the dispensed liquid to fully dispense any remaining droplets in the tips. Dispense back any remaining cell suspension in the original plate with the cells.\nNote: If preparing multiple plates, dispense the total volume for all the plates a V-shape. This would reduce the extra volume needed.",
    "Carefully remove the plate from the Viaflo and place it into the incubator at 37°C/5% CO2 for 2 h for cells to self-aggregate into spheres.\nAfter 2 h, cells should be deposited within the micromold due to gravity. Place the 96-well plate Gri3D® into one of the plate holders of a three station Viaflo with a 96 well head. Using the multidrop, dispense 200 μL per well of liver sphere medium supplemented with factors as described before. If multiple plates have been prepared, dispense 200 μL per plate. Place the plate with the A1 well facing the top left, the microwells or feeder wells should be facing left at this position. Place a deep well 96-well plate in the next position, and the deep well with the media in the last position. Aspirate any liquid from the feeding chamber using the Viaflo and dispense it into the waste plate. Move the station for the Viaflo to access the plate with the media. Aspirate 150 μL, move back the plate station and move the Viaflo into the feeding chamber. Dispense the media at speed 3 and mix 100 μL 5 times at speed 5.\nNote: Incubation time can be extended up to 6 h to ensure cells are deposited into the micromolds. The previous step will be referred as media change for the 96-well plate Gri3D® plates\nNote: Automating the Viaflo pipetting of this process in custom programs is key to reduce variability. Automation optimization using a test plate and culture media without cells prior the sphere aggregation is recommended. Similar results can be achieved using a multichannel pipette but the use of semi-automatic liquid handling systems is recommended to reduce user-to-user and well-to-well variability.\nMeasuring cytochrome P450 (CYP P450) metabolic activity in Gri3D® plates",
    "Timing: [1 h per medium change, 2 d per characterization]\nThis step describes how to feed the liver spheres and characterize the cytochrome P450 for activity of liver spheres using the 96-well Gri3D® plate. Spheres can be maintained in this format up to one month.\nFeed the plates every two to three days as described in the previous section.

On a feeding day, prepare supplemented liver sphere medium with 100 μM of Luciferin-ME (Promega) to measure CYP P450 1A2 activity. Add the supplemented medium to the cells and incubate for 24 h.\nFollowing incubation, use the Viaflo to mix 100 μL of the medium from the feeding chamber 5 times at speed 3 and aspirate 150 μL to mix completely the medium supplemented with Luciferin. Collect all medium from the feeding chamber using the Viaflo and dispense 50 μL per well into a 96-well white plates in triplicate.

    "Pause Point: After dispensing of 50 μL into the white plates, plates can be frozen at −20°C and store for 1 month. The measurements can be performed at a later timepoint. For this, cover the plates with lids and seal with parafilm.\nAdd 50 μL per well of the luciferase reagent from the P450-Glo assay kit (Promega) into the white plates with the 50 μL of media with Luciferin-ME prepared previously and read the activity according to manufacturer's instructions.\nRepeat the CYP P450 characterization once a week up to a month. On the last timepoint, after dispensing the media into the white plates, add 150 μL per well of RIPA buffer (Thermofisher) instead of supplemented liver spheroid media. Seal the plate with parafilm and freeze it at −20°C for at least 24 h.\nNote: At this step plates can be stored at −80°C for up to 3 months.\nAfter 24 h, thaw the samples at room temperature (15°C–21°C) in a plate shaker at medium speed (∼ 30 rpm). Perform bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA, Thermofisher) protein quantification according to manufacturer's instructions. Use 10 μL of sample in triplicate for the BCA assay.\nNote: Plate sonication (23.3W) for 15 min can help to break down the structures of the spheres.\nMeasure the relative levels of CYP P450 1A2 activity over time by normalizing the RLU signal per mg protein as determined by the BCA assay (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/629-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "This step describes how to perform high content imaging of the liver spheres and the image analysis of the data generated. 48 h following liver sphere aggregation, morphological characterization of liver sphere size and number of spheres per well can be performed using the Operetta high content imaging system (PerkinElmer). This procedure offers a non-disruptive method for sphere size characterization which can be used to monitor sphere growth under normal cell culture conditions or during screening experiments.\nIf your high content imaging system is equipped with a live chamber to maintain the cells at 37°C/5% CO2, precondition the live imaging chamber 30 min before imaging. Place the plate on the live imaging chamber once it reached the right temperature and CO2 concentration.\nUsing a 2× objective, most of the well containing the liver spheres should be captured in a single image. Set the focus and image the whole plate. After imaging, place the plate back to the incubator.\nFollowing image acquisition, image analysis can be performed using Columbus software (Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/629-Mmc1.pdf]: Material analysis pipeline - Analysis Sequence ‘SphereQuant_texture’). First, use texture-based pixel classification to identify the liver spheres from the background. This can be achieved by training texture-based classifier to distinguish between two classes (cell aggregate and background) by selecting multiple examples of pixels for each class (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). Next, generate an inverted image which can be used for sphere identification based on sphere size and texture using the ‘Find Nuclei’ block (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). Following this, an object classification can be used for sphere selection as a quality control step to ensure that only properly segmented spheres are analyzed (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). Finally, object count, and morphology quantification are performed for sphere count and area quantification (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/629-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.
