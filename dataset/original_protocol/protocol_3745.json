    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nhiPSC Passaging and Maintenance\nTiming: 10–20 min\nhiPSCs are maintained under feeder-free conditions with daily medium changes and kept at 37°C and 5% CO2. When the cells reach 70-95% confluency, the cells can be passaged (approx. every 3-5 days).\nPrewarm Matrigel-coated plates, hiPSC Culture Medium and EDTA Dissociation Buffer to 20-25°C.\nAspirate Matrigel from the precoated culture plates and add hiPSC Culture Medium (2 ml per well of a 6-well plate).\nAspirate medium of hiPSCs. Cover the cells carefully with EDTA Dissociation Buffer (e.g. 1 ml per well of a 6-well plate) and directly aspirate again.\nCover the cells carefully with EDTA Dissociation Buffer (e.g. 1 ml per well of a 6-well plate) and incubate with minimal movement for 3-5 min.\nNote: The longer the incubation, the smaller the cell clumps will be. The optimal incubation time should be determined for each cell line; however, 3 min are sufficient for most cell lines.\nCarefully aspirate solution and rapidly wash the cells off the well with 1 ml hiPSC Culture Medium (for 6-well), but avoid excessive pipetting to keep small clumps intact. The colonies will reattach quickly when not taken off the plate.\nNote: If overtreated with EDTA and already detached from the plate, the cells could be collected, diluted in medium (e.g. 1:1), centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min, and resuspended in fresh medium.\nPlate the desired amount onto the prepared Matrigel-coated plates with medium (e.g. 1:6-1:10 or count and plate defined cell number). Add 1 μl/ml of 2 mM Thiazovivin (final concentration 2 μM) for the first 24 h.\nShake the plate carefully to distribute the cells evenly and incubate at 37°C and 5% CO2 .",
    "Change the medium every day to 2 ml hiPSC Culture Medium per well of a 6-well plate.\nNote: On one day per week (when the cells are less than 50% confluent), the medium change can be skipped. For this, add 3 ml of hiPSC Culture Medium per well of a 6-well plate the day before and then return to daily medium changes after 48 h.\nPause Point: For differentiation of hiPSCs into cardiomyocytes, continue with step 22 (see ‘Subtype-Directed Differentiation of hiPSCs into Atrial and Ventricular Cardiomyocytes’). If hiPSCs are not intended to be differentiated shortly, they can be cryopreserved when they have reached a confluency of 70-95% (see ‘hiPSC Cryopreservation’, steps 9-14) and recovered for culture when needed (see ‘hiPSC Recovery’, steps 15-21).\nhiPSC Cryopreservation\nTiming: 10–20 min\nFor cryopreservation, hiPSCs can be released from the culture plates when they reach 70-95% confluency.\nPrewarm hiPSC Culture Medium, hiPSC Cryopreservation Medium and EDTA Dissociation Buffer to 20-25°C.\nAspirate medium of hiPSCs. Cover the cells carefully with EDTA Dissociation Buffer (e.g. 1 ml per well of a 6-well plate) and directly aspirate again.\nCover the cells carefully with EDTA Dissociation Buffer (e.g. 1 ml per well of a 6-well plate) and incubate with minimal movement for 3-5 min.\nNote: The longer the incubation, the smaller the cell clumps will be. The optimal incubation time should be determined for each cell line; however, 3 min are sufficient for most cell lines.\nCarefully aspirate solution and rapidly wash the cells off the well with 0.75 ml hiPSC Culture Medium (for 6-well), but avoid excessive pipetting to keep small clumps intact. The colonies will reattach quickly when not taken off the plate.",
    "Note: If overtreated with EDTA and already detached from the plate, the cells could be collected, diluted in medium (e.g. 1:1), centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min, and resuspended in fresh medium.\nIn a dropwise manner, add 0.75 ml of Cryopreservation Medium to the well (for 6-well) and carefully mix.\nTransfer the cells into cryogenic vials, freeze at -80°C in an isopropanol freezing container for at least 2 h, then store in the vapor phase of a liquid nitrogen freezer.\nNote: Long-term storage in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen (at a temperature between -140°C and -180°C) for more than 5 years was tested without loss of pluripotency or loss of differentiation capacity.\nhiPSC Recovery\nTiming: 10–20 min\nCryopreserved hiPSCs can be thawed as described here. Prior to starting the cardiac differentiation, thawed hiPSCs should be allowed to recover for 2-3 passages.\nNote: Cryogenic vials containing hiPSCs harvested from one well of a 6-well plate can be plated to 2-3 new wells and usually reach confluency after 2-3 days.\nPrewarm Matrigel-coated plates and hiPSC Culture Medium to 20-25°C.\nAspirate Matrigel from the precoated culture plates and add hiPSC Culture Medium (2 ml per well of a 6-well plate).\nAdd 9 ml of hiPSC Culture Medium to a 15 ml centrifuge tube.\nDirectly transfer the cryogenic vial to a 37°C water bath and observe the thawing process. When most the content of the tube is thawed and only a small chunk of ice remains, quickly take it out and clean thoroughly with 70% ethanol.\nCarefully transfer the cells in a dropwise manner to the prepared 15 ml centrifuge tube with medium. Centrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min.",
    "Carefully aspirate the supernatant. Resuspend the pellet in hiPSC Culture Medium (e.g. 1 ml) and plate on the prepared Matrigel-coated plates with medium. Add 1 μl/ml of 2 mM Thiazovivin (final concentration 2 μM) for the first 24 h.\nIf the cells are well attached after 24 h, perform medium change with hiPSC Culture Medium. In case of low attachment, add 1 μl/ml of 2 mM Thiazovivin (final concentration 2 μM) for another 24 h. From the next day onwards, change the medium daily to 2 ml of hiPSC Culture Medium per well (6-well). Continue with ‘hiPSC passaging and maintenance’, steps 1-8.\nSubtype-Directed Differentiation of hiPSCs into Atrial and Ventricular Cardiomyocytes\nTiming: 10–12 days\nThe cardiac differentiation of hiPSCs can be conducted along the atrial or the ventricular lineage. Both protocols comprise a series of medium changes as illustrated in the graphical abstract, in between which the cells are kept at 37°C and 5% CO2. Although atrial and ventricular hiPSC-cardiomyocytes exhibit similar changes in morphology during differentiation (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]), cultures of atrial cardiomyocytes typically contract significantly faster than ventricular cardiomyocyte cultures (see Videos S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] and S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/67-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Subtype-Directed Differentiation of hiPSCs into Atrial and Ventricular Cardiomyocytes\nhiPSCs undergoing ventricular cardiac differentiation. By day 8-10, the cells typically start to beat and develop a characteristic ‘net-like’ morphology. Atrial cells exhibit similar morphological changes, but can be distinguished from ventricular cells by their higher beating frequency (see Videos S1 [href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] and S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]). Consistent field of view over time is shown.

    "Note: It is recommended to use hiPSCs between passages 15 and 50 for effective differentiation. The hiPSC line should express pluripotency markers and exhibit a normal karyotype (see Troubleshooting Problem 1).\nDays -4 to -1: for both atrial and ventricular differentiation:\nPassage hiPSCs as described in ‘hiPSC passaging and maintenance’ (steps 1-5). After releasing the cells, count them using an automated cell counter or a hemocytometer, and plate defined cell numbers into a final volume of 2 ml per well (6-well).\nNote: The optimal seeding density for plating is cell line-dependent; it can range between 15,000-26,000 cells/cm 2, i.e. 150,000-260,000 cells per well (6-well).\nNote: Each confluent well of a 6-well maintenance plate will yield 1-3×106 cells for plating.\nChange the hiPSC Culture Medium daily with 2 ml per well (6-well).\nNote: Time for expansion to 80%-95% confluence can range between 2-4 days.\nDay 0: for both atrial and ventricular differentiation:\nWhen the hiPSCs reach a confluency of 80-95%, start the differentiation (= d0).\nCritical: The optimal cell density at the start of differentiation is crucial and should be determined empirically for each cell line.\nFreshly prepare Cardio Differentiation Medium with 4-5 μM CHIR99021 (0.4-0.5 μl/ml of 10 mM stock solution).\nCritical: The optimal concentration of CHIR99021 can differ between cell lines and should be determined empirically. We recommend 4 μM as a starting point (see Troubleshooting Problem 2).\nAspirate the spent hiPSC Culture Medium and add 3 ml per well (6-well) of Cardio Differentiation Medium with CHIR99021.\nDay 2: for both atrial and ventricular differentiation:\nFreshly prepare Cardio Differentiation Medium with 5 μM IWP2 (1 μl/ml of 5 mM stock solution). Aspirate the spent medium and carefully add 3 ml per well (6-well) of Cardio Differentiation Medium with IWP2.\nDay 3: for atrial differentiation:",
    "Add 1 μl/ml of 1 mM retinoic acid (final concentration 1 μM) to the cells without aspiration of the spent medium.\nNote: For ventricular differentiation, no action is needed on day 3 of differentiation.\nDay 4: for atrial differentiation:\nFreshly prepare Cardio Differentiation Medium with 1 μM retinoic acid (1 μl/ml of 1 mM stock solution). Aspirate the spent medium and carefully add 3 ml per well (6-well) of Cardio Differentiation Medium with retinoic acid.\nDay 4: for ventricular differentiation:\nAspirate the spent medium and carefully add 3 ml per well (6-well) of fresh Cardio Differentiation medium.\nDay 6: for both atrial and ventricular differentiation:\nAspirate the spent medium and carefully add 3 ml per well (6-well) of fresh Cardio Differentiation medium.\nFrom day 8: for both atrial and ventricular differentiation:\nFrom day 8 onwards, change the medium to 2 or 3 ml of Cardio Culture Medium per well (6-well) every 2 or 3 days, respectively (e.g. 2 ml on Monday and Wednesday, 3 ml on Friday).\nOptionally, replate the cells in a lower density (see ‘Digestion of hiPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes’ steps 31-38) and perform cardiomyocyte selection (see ‘Metabolic Selection of hiPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes’ steps 39-43), ideally between days 12-25 of differentiation.\nNote: First spontaneous contractions of cultures can be observed after 8 days of differentiation, robust spontaneous contractions after 10-12 days. If, after day 15, no beating cells have been present on several consecutive days of observation, the differentiation has likely failed. Please note that the spontaneous contraction is affected by several factors including medium contents and environment temperature, so that, if necessary, additional characteristics should be examined such as expression of cardiac markers via flow cytometry or immunocytochemistry (see ‘Immunostaining of hiPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes’, steps 60-71).",
    "Note: hiPSC-derived atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes can be maintained in culture for 2 months and longer (see Troubleshooting Problem 3).\nPause Point: If differentiated atrial/ventricular cardiomyocytes are not required for immediate use, they can be cryopreserved from day 15 after the start of differentiation onwards (see ‘Cryopreservation of hiPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes’ steps 44-51) and recovered for culture when needed (see ‘Recovery of hiPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes’, steps 52-59).\nDigestion of hiPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes\nTiming: 30–45 min\nDigestion of hiPSC-derived atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes can be performed in order to plate cells into desired culture vessel formats at defined cell numbers if required (e.g. in lower cell density prior to metabolic selection).\nPrewarm Cardio Recovery Medium, PBS or EDTA Dissociation Buffer, Matrigel-coated plates, 0.25% trypsin-EDTA to 20-25°C.\nAspirate Matrigel from the precoated culture plates and add Cardio Recovery Medium per well (2 ml per well of a 6-well plate).\nAspirate medium of the hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Wash the cells once with PBS or EDTA Dissociation Buffer (e.g. 1 ml per well of a 6-well plate) and directly aspirate again.\nAdd 1 ml of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA per well (6-well) to the cells and incubate at 37°C for 8-12 min. Continue when the cells become round and start to detach from the plate.\nCarefully wash all cells from the plate and transfer them into a 15 ml centrifuge tube. Add the same volume of Cardio Recovery Medium and centrifuge at 100 × g for 10 min.\nCritical: Because the cells are very sensitive, handle them carefully and avoid extensive pipetting.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in a small volume (1-2 ml) of Cardio Recovery Medium.\nPlate the desired cell number (after counting or at a particular ratio) on prepared coated plates.\nNote: The cell viability should be greater than 55%.",
    "After 2 days, change the medium to 2 ml of Cardio Culture Medium and change this medium every 2 or 3 days thereafter (e.g. 2 ml on Monday and Wednesday, 3 ml on Friday).\nNote: Before performing analysis of or further experiments with digested cardiomyocytes, let them recover on the cell culture plate for 4-7 days (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/67-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Recovery of hiPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes after Replating/Thawing\nA typical hiPSC-cardiomyocyte morphology can be observed from day 4 after replating or thawing of the cells displayed for the ventricular subtype (atrial cells show similar morphological changes). A CRISPR-engineered hiPSC line with endogenous tagging of ACTN2 with a fluorescence marker illustrates the formation of sarcomeric structures at 12 days after replating. Consistent field of view over time is shown. Scale bars represent 100 μm.\nNote: If digestion with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA seems too harsh for any particular cell line, attempt to use a 0.05% dilution instead.\nAlternatives: Instead of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA, you can use 10× TrypLE Select or Accutase.\nMetabolic Selection of hiPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes\nTiming: 3–7 days\nMetabolic selection can be performed in order to purify hiPSC-derived atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes after the differentiation. Provision of lactate as the only energy source is permissive of the survival of cells with cardiac-like metabolism only. To enhance selection efficiency and prevent detachment of cardiomyocytes, replate the cells at a lower density, ideally around day 15. The optimal time point for selection is between days 15-30, due to the cells’ high sensitivity to lactate associated with their proliferative state at this age; however, selection is possible until day 60.",
    "Digest the differentiated cells as described in ‘Digestion of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes’ (steps 31-36). After resuspending the cells, count them using an automated cell counter or a hemocytometer, and plate in a lower density, e.g. at a ratio of 1:3 or at a defined cell number of 1-2×106 cells per well (6-well).\nAllow cells to regenerate in Cardio Culture Medium for 3-5 days before starting the selection. Change the medium every 2-3 days.\nStart the selection process by aspirating the spent medium and adding 2 ml per well (6-well) of Cardio Selection Medium.\nChange the medium to 2 or 3 ml Cardio Selection Medium every 2 or 3 days, respectively, for the duration of the selection process (e.g. 2 ml on Monday and Wednesday, 3 ml on Friday).\nTo stop the selection, switch to Cardio Culture Medium. Change the medium to 2 ml of Cardio Culture Medium and change this medium every 2 or 3 days thereafter (e.g. 2 ml on Monday and Wednesday, 3 ml on Friday).\nNote: The incubation time in Cardio Selection Medium is dependent on the age of the cardiomyocytes: 3-5 days before day 30, and 5-7 days for cells between days 30 and 60 (see Troubleshooting Problem 4).\nCryopreservation of hiPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes\nTiming: 3 h\nhiPSC-derived atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes can be cryopreserved for long-term storage. To ensure pure populations, the cells should ideally be frozen after having passed through a digestion and selection process. Cryopreservation can be performed from day 15 after the start of differentiation onwards.\nPrewarm FBS, PBS or EDTA Dissociation Buffer, 0.25% trypsin-EDTA to 20-25°C.\nAspirate medium of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Wash the cells once with PBS or EDTA Dissociation Buffer (e.g. 1 ml per well of a 6-well plate) and directly aspirate again.",
    "Add 1 ml of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA per well (6-well) to the cells and incubate at 37°C for 8-12 min. Continue when the cells become round and start to detach from the plate.\nCarefully wash all cells from the plate and transfer them into a 15 ml centrifuge tube. Add the same volume of FBS and centrifuge at 100 × g  for 10 min.\nCritical: Because the cells are very sensitive, handle them carefully and avoid extensive pipetting.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in a small volume (1-2 ml, depending on the size of the cell pellet) of FBS, and count the cells using an automated cell counter or a hemocytometer.\nAccording to the desired volume and cell number per cryogenic vial and the consequent total number of cryogenic vials needed, fill up the cell suspension with FBS to 80% of the total required volume. Add a final concentration of 1× Cardio Cryopreservation Medium (from 5×), mix carefully and dispense the cell suspension into the cryogenic vials.\nNote: We suggest a cell density of 2-5×106 cells in 1.5 ml of cryopreservation medium per vial.\nTransfer the tubes to a controlled rate freezing device (e.g. Cryotherm Planer) and freeze the cells according to the protocol in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_67_1.csv\nAlternatives: If no automated controlled rate freezer is available, freeze the cells in an isopropanol freezing container at -80°C for at least 2 h.\nAfter a minimum of 10 min at -90°C, store the tubes in the vapor phase of a liquid nitrogen freezer.\nNote: Long-term storage in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen (at a temperature between -140°C and -180°C) for more than 2 years was tested without obvious effects on cell quality.",
    "Note: If digestion with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA seems too harsh for any particular cell line, attempt to use a 0.05% dilution instead.\nAlternatives: Instead of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA, you can use 10× TrypLE Select or Accutase.\nRecovery of hiPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes\nTiming: 10–20 min\nCryopreserved hiPSC-derived atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes can be recovered into culture as described here.\nNote: Recovery rates of cryopreserved hiPSC-cardiomyocytes might vary between cell lines. Typically, plating efficiencies of 50%–-90% can be expected.\nPrewarm Matrigel-coated plates and Cardio Recovery Medium to 20-25°C.\nAspirate Matrigel from the precoated culture plates and add Cardio Recovery Medium (2 ml per well of a 6-well plate).\nPrepare a 15 ml centrifuge tube with 9 ml of Cardio Recovery Medium.\nTransfer the cryogenic vial containing the cells from the liquid nitrogen storage directly to a 37°C water bath and observe the thawing process. When most of the content of the tube is thawed and only a small chunk of ice remains, quickly take it out and clean thoroughly with 70% ethanol.\nCarefully add the cells dropwise into the prepared 15 ml centrifuge tube. Gently mix and centrifuge at 100 × g for 10 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and carefully resuspend the cells in 1 ml of Cardio Recovery Medium.\nCritical: Because the cells are very sensitive, handle them carefully and avoid extensive pipetting.\nPlate the desired cell number on the coated plates and incubate at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nNote: Upon thawing, we recommend an initial plating of 1-3×106 cells per well of a 6-well plate to ensure optimal recovery of cells.\nOptional: Recount the cells before plating (note that the recovery rate might not be accurate at this point, so that the number of plated and attached cells might be lower than the total number of living cells counted).",
    "Change the medium to Cardio Culture Medium (2 ml per well of a 6-well plate) after a recovery period of 2-3 days. Continue changing the medium regularly every 2 or 3 days thereafter (e.g. 2 ml on Monday and Wednesday, 3 ml on Friday).\nNote: Before performing analysis of or further experiments with thawed cardiomyocytes, let them recover on the cell culture plate for 4-7 days (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nImmunostaining of hiPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes\nTiming: 2 days\nFor the characterization and quality control of hiPSC-derived atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes, they can be fixed and immunocytochemically stained for the expression of cardiac markers, such as α-actinin, cTNT, RYR2, MLC2a, and MLC2v.\nCarefully place sterile glass cover slips into a multi-well plate (e.g. cover slips 20 mm in diameter into 12-well plates). Coat the cover slips with Matrigel as described in ‘Before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]’ (e.g. with 500 μl per 20 mm cover slip).\nAlternatives: Chamber slides with detachable rims can be coated with Matrigel, or – if the microscopic setup allows and the stained cells do not need to be kept on mounted microscope slides – the cells can also be stained directly in the cell culture plates.\nDigest the differentiated cells as described in ‘Digestion of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes’ (steps 31-36). After resuspending the cells, count them using an automated cell counter or a hemocytometer, and plate at the desired cell density, e.g. 70,000-150,000 cells per 20 mm cover slip.\nAllow the cells to regenerate in Cardio Culture Medium for 7-10 days before fixation. Change the medium every 2-3 days.\nAspirate the medium of the cardiomyocytes on glass cover slips. Wash the cells three times with PBS.\nIncubate the cells in 4% Histofix (or other fixative solution) at 20-25°C for 20 min. Wash them three times with PBS.",

Mount the cover slips upside down onto clean glass slides with a few drops of an aqueous mounting medium (e.g. Fluoromount/Vectashield). Be careful not to create bubbles when lowering the cover slips onto the slides.\nLet the mounting medium dry for 1 h and seal the edges of the coverslip with nail varnish. Store the slides at 4°C in the dark."
