    "Two studies11,12 that applied the described procedures have been approved by the ethics committee of the University of Hildesheim and were in line with the declaration of Helsinki.\n1. Set-up\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53101/53101fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Sketch of the set-up in the two experimental rooms. P = real participant, C1/C2 = confederates, mic = microphone, cam = camera Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53101/53101fig1large.jpg]\nUse two separate rooms. One for the manipulation of the social/personal identity, the preparation phase of the TSST and the recovery phase after the TSST (Room 1), and one for the speech and mental arithmetic task of the TSST (Room 2). The set-up of both rooms is illustrated in Figure 1.\n\t\nPlace three chairs and one big table as depicted in Figure 1 in Room 1A (social identity manipulation, preparation phase of the TSST, and recovery phase). Place a box for Task 1 (see below) on the table and provide three pens and some sheets of paper for Task 1 and Task 2.\n\t\t\nProvide nine T-shirts in three different colors—three T-shirts in each color (e.g., blue, green, and yellow). Provide three stick-on labels for the name tags.\nFor the bogus lot drawing procedure, write “committee” on two small pieces of paper and fold them neatly. Write “applicant” on a third piece of paper and crumple it. Put the crumbled ball of paper and the two folded pieces of paper in a pouch.\nPlace three chairs and three small tables as depicted in Figure 1 in Room 1B (personal identity manipulation, preparation phase of the TSST, recovery phase). Place a box for Task 1 on each table. Provide the same additional materials as in the social identity condition.",
    "Place a table and two chairs for the committee members (the participant is standing) as depicted in Figure 1 in Room 2 (speech and mental arithmetic task of the TSST).\n\t\t\nProvide the following items for the committee on the table in Room 2: Two pens and two sheets of papers for taking notes, two stopwatches, and two sheets with the solutions to the mental arithmetic task.\nInstall two video cameras (Cam 1 and Cam 2), one pointing towards the position of the participant, which is defined by the microphone (Cam 1), and one pointing at the committee (Cam 2). Attach the cable of the microphone to Cam 1 or to a laptop.\nTo assure a standardized behavior of the TSST-committee, use two trained confederates (one male and one female) who are of similar age as the studied population. Moreover, confederates need to be unfamiliar with the participants before the study since this may affect the level of identification.\n\tNote: If using more than two confederates, then it is important that the different confederates are of similar age, appearance, and attractiveness and that the assignment of confederates is balanced across the different conditions in order to assure that a particular set of confederates is not confounded with a specific experimental condition.\nAssess different indicators of the psycho-physiological stress response (e.g., cortisol, self-reported stress, heart rate) to test the stress reaction evoked by the TSST.\n\t\nMeasure these stress indicators repeatedly before, during, and after the TSST in order to control for baseline differences, to examine the anticipatory stress response, the peak response level, and the recovery rate7.",
    "Note: For cortisol, four (minimum three15) measurement points are sufficient to cover these requirements (for an example of integration in the experimental procedure, see Frisch et al.12). However, more measurement points increase the resolution of the stress response and the number of necessary measurements also depends on the temporal dynamics of the selected stress indicator7 (e.g., heart rate can be measured continuously during the TSST).\nWhen measuring cortisol or any other physiological indicator of stress, apply the standard inclusion criteria17 for participants. Do not use participants for cortisol analyses who are pregnant, use hormonal contraception or other prescribed medication, smoke or suffer from psychiatric, endocrine, cardiovascular, or other chronic diseases. Moreover, have eligible participants refrain from consuming alcohol the day before the study, and eating meals, drinking caffeine, or exercising 2 hr before the beginning of the study. Furthermore, since cortisol follows a diurnal rhythm18, schedule experimental sessions at the same daytime.\n2. Manipulation of Social/Personal Identity\nWelcome participants (i.e., one real participant and two confederates) to Room 1.\nPlace participants as depicted in Figure 1. In the social identity condition, seat the real participant and the confederates around one table. In the personal identity condition, seat the real participant and the confederates at individual tables.\nTell participants a cover story about the study (e.g., that in this study new tasks for assessment centers are tested) and obtain their informed consent for participation. Importantly, ask participants not to interact with each other during the session.\nTo induce a social identity, use the following means:\n\t\nAlways address participants as a group (e.g., “You all will do …”).",
    "Ask participants to introduce themselves (name, age, and subject of study). Have the real participant begin. Have the two confederates pretend to have a first name that has the same initial letter as the name of the real participant (e.g., John, Julia, Jim). Moreover, have the confederates declare to be at about the same age as the real participant and to be students.\n\t\t\nForm a group name out of the three first name initials (e.g., JJJ) and let each participant write it on a stick-on label. Tell participants that for reasons of anonymity they will not be addressed by their own names but by this group name throughout the experimental session.\nAsk participants to choose one out of three differently colored T-shirts. Tell them that wearing standardized clothes will help them to fully focus on the experiment. The real participant chooses first and the confederates each take a T-shirt of the same color. Ask participants (i.e., the real participants and the two confederates) to wear this T-shirt until the end of the experimental session. Have participants place the label with the group name on their T-shirts.\nInstruct participants to think about ways to improve the quality of life in their city (Task 1). Have participants write each idea on a single sheet of paper and put it into the box on the table. Tell participants that the group performance will be evaluated. Let participants perform this task for 3 min.\nInstruct participants to write down as many similarities (e.g., goals, wishes, and habits) as possible that they think they share with their fellow group members (Task 2). Let participants perform this task for 3 min.\nTake a group picture (optional).\nTo induce a personal identity (alternatively to 2.4) use the following means:",
    "Always address participants personally (e.g., “Each of you will do …”).\nAsk participants to introduce themselves (name, age, and subject of study). Have the real participant always begin. Have the two confederates pretend to have a first name with a different initial letter as the real participant (e.g., John, Kate, Peter). Have one confederate declare to be younger and the other to be older than the real participant. Have one confederate declare to be a student and the other to be an employee of the university.\n\t\t\nHave participants write down their respective first name initial on a stick-on label. Tell participants that for reasons of anonymity they will not be addressed by their own names but by their initials throughout the experimental session.\nAsk participants to choose one out of three differently colored T-shirts. Tell them that wearing standardized clothes will help them to fully focus on the experiment. The real participant chooses first. Each confederate chooses a different T-shirt color than the real participant and the other confederate. Participants have to wear this T-shirt until the end of the experimental session. Have participants place the label with the personal initial on their T-shirts.\nInstruct participantsto think about ways to improve the quality of life in their city (Task 1). Ask participants to write each idea on a single sheet of paper and to put it into their individual box on the table. Tell participants that their individual performance will be evaluated. Let participants perform this task for 3 min.\nInstruct participants to write down as many differences (e.g., goals, wishes, and habits) as possible that they think may distinguish themselves from the other two participants (Task 2). Let participants perform this task for 3 min.\nTake a picture of each participant (optional).",
    "Use the group identification measure of Frisch et al.12 (adapted from Doosje et al.19, see Table 1 for the items) to verify the success of the identity manipulation (i.e., participants in the social identity condition should report higher levels of group identification than participants in the personal identity condition).\n3. Trier Social Stress Test (Including Manipulation of Ccommittee Behavior)\nNote: Step 3.2 and 3.3 (faked drawing of lots procedure) are not mandatory. In case of no prior manipulation of the relationship between the committee members and the participant (i.e., the applicant), start with 3.1 and continue then directly with the TSST (3.4).\nExplain the TSST briefly to participants as a task that is frequently used in assessment centers and requires one participant to take the role of an applicant in a job interview and two participants to act as a selection committee. Tell the participants that the selection committee will be evaluating the applicant and that a video of him/her will be recorded which will be used for a later analysis of his/her nonverbal behavior and a voice frequency analysis7.\nTell participants that the roles in this task will be assigned by lot. Let each participant draw a piece of paper out of the pouch on which his/her role will be indicated (either “applicant” or “committee”). Have the confederates always draw first and let them take the neatly folded lots on which “committee” is written (see above). Have the real participant draw last, so that he/she is always designated to be the applicant.",
    "Hand out the sheet with the TSST-instruction to the committee members (i.e., confederates) and tell them that they now have some time to prepare their roles. Note that these 'instructions' are part of the cover story, so the real participant believes that the two confederates are real participants.\n\tNote: Since the confederates are already familiar with the TSST procedure, it is not important what these instructions actually entail (e.g., as a reminder for the confederates they may entail the exact wording of the verbal instructions of the committee).\nGuide the two committee members to Room 2. Inform them now how they should behave in the upcoming TSST. Note that the confederates are not informed about the experimental condition earlier in order to avoid that the confederates’ behavior during the identity manipulation is influenced in any way by whether the real participant is assigned to the supportive or unsupportive condition.\nGo back to the real participant in Room 1.\nTell the real participant that he/she now has 3 min to prepare his/her speech. Tell him/her: “Imagine you have applied for your dream job and you are invited to a job interview. Please prepare a 5 min talk in which you aim to convince the selection committee that you are the most qualified candidate for this job. The committee would like to hear what qualifies you for the job. Please imagine that the committee members have already read your curriculum vitae and that therefore, you should not tell them anything about your professional skills and work experiences; rather you should focus on your personality. You may take notes during the preparation of the talk, but you are not allowed to use these notes during the job interview.”",
    "Guide the participant to Room 2, turn on the video cameras, leave the room, and wait outside.\nFor the speech task (5 min), have the committee members ask the participant to start with his/her speech. Note that the verbal instructions of the TSST-committee for the speech task of the TSST have been published elsewhere (see Birkett20 and Kudielka et al.7).\nFor the mental arithmetic task (5 min), have the committee members introduce the mental arithmetic task to participants (i.e., counting backwards from 2,043 in steps of 17). When the time is up, have the committee members thank the participant and tell him/her to leave the room. Note that the verbal instructions of the TSST-committee for the mental arithmetic task of the TSST have been published elsewhere (see Birkett20 and Kudielka et al.7).\nDuring the speech and the mental arithmetic task of the TSST, have the committee act either supportively or unsupportively. This supportive/unsupportive behavior starts about 20 sec after the commencement of the speech task to make this behavior look reactive and natural (see Figure 2).\n\t\nIn the supportive committee condition, have the committee members show non-verbal affirmative signals throughout the TSST, for example, an open body posture (i.e., arms are open and not crossed, legs are parallel and not crossed), tilting the head, leaning forward, and smiling.\n\t\t\nHave the committee members provide the participant with positive feedback by increasingly nodding and smiling as the task progresses. Have them exchange glances with each other indicating approval of the participant and his/her performance. Ensure that the committee members show these behaviors as a reaction to what the participant says or does (e.g., if the participant gives a correct number or if he/she says something positive about him-/herself in the speech task, the committee members will smile and nod).",
    "In the unsupportive committee condition (alternatively to 3.10.1), have the committee members show non-verbal negative signals throughout the TSST, for example, a closed body posture (i.e., crossed arms and legs, leaning backwards), and frowning.\n\t\t\nHave them provide the participant with negative feedback (independent of the real quality of his/her performance) by sighing, rolling eyes, shaking the head, staring at the participant in disbelief, looking skeptically at their notes, and exchanging glances with each other indicating mutual resentment. Ensure that the committee members show these behaviors as a reaction to what the participant says or does (e.g., if the participant gives a wrong number or if he/she says something positive about him-/herself in the speech task the committee members will look at him/her skeptically, in disbelief, and shake the head).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53101/53101fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Picture of supportive and unsupportive committee.  Example of the body posture and the facial expressions of the committee members during the TSST. A = supportive behavior, B = unsupportive behavior.\n4. Resting Period\nWait outside Room 2 for the participant to open the door and guide the participant and confederates back to Room 1.\nHand out the manipulation check of committee behavior to the real participant. This questionnaire asks the participant how he/she perceived the committee members’ behavior during the TSST (see Table 2 for the items). Note that in order to keep up the role of the confederates as real participants, hand out a similar questionnaire to the confederates asking them how they evaluate their own behavior during the TSST.\n\tNote: This questionnaire is necessary in order to see if the manipulation of committee behavior was successful (i.e., participants that faced an unsupportive committee should report that the committee was unsupportive whereas participants that faced a supportive committee should report that the committee was supportive).",
    "Let participants rest and, if needed, take further samples of stress indicators under study.\nLet participants fill in a suspicion check in which they are asked to describe what they think the aim of the study was.\n\t\nExclude those participants who (a) suspected that the confederates were no real participants, (b) suspected the identity manipulation to aim at inducing a feeling of “we”-ness, (c) suspected the committee behavior to be scripted, or (d) guessed the aim of the study.\nThank, pay, and fully debrief participants. Include three important steps in the debriefing of participants (see also Kudielka et al.7):\n\t\nClarify that confederates were used and explain to the participant that this was necessary to assure a standardized committee behavior. Assure the participant that the behavioral reactions of the two confederates in the TSST (especially in the unsupportive condition) were scripted and absolutely unconnected to his/her person or his/her performance during the TSST. It is advisable that the two confederates take an active part in this phase of the debriefing.\nExplain the TSST to the participant and tell him/her that it is designed to induce high levels of stress and that almost every participant reports high levels of stress and fails to perform well in the speech and mental arithmetic task. Tell the participant that the recorded video will not be analyzed but will be deleted instead.\nExplain the design of the study and the research question to the participant. Furthermore, ask participants not to share the details of this study with other people in order to prevent contamination of the pool of participants.\nSubscription Required.
