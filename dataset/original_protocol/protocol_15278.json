    "1. Equipment\nThe major components of a contraction measurement device are shown schematically in Figure 2A).\nA tissue bath. The tissue bath maintains an oxygenated physiological solution at warm temperature. For mice trachea rings, we use a 10 ml tissue bath that contains a water jacket for circulating a warming solution, a fritted glass inlet to bubble oxygen (95%/5% O2/CO2 mixture) and inlet and outlet ports for changing solutions. A reservoir PSS solution is stored with constant bubbling of 95%/5% O2/CO2 mixture in a 37 °C water bath (not shown). For solution exchanges, PSS solution is pumped from the reservoir to the tissue bath inlet (bottom port) at approximately 100 mls per minute to allow relatively fast solution exchange. The solution outlet is through an overflow port (top port) that allows constant volume (~10 ml) in the tissue bath during solution exchange. We use a Haake heating circulator to pump warm water through the tissue bath jacket (to maintain 37 °C). Tissue baths can be obtained from a number of suppliers and come in a variety of sizes and styles to fit the experimental needs of the investigator.",
    "A force transducer. To measure isometric tension, the trachea tube is threaded over L-shaped ends of two stainless steel rods (Figure 2A). Care should be taken to use a stainless steel type that is compatible with biological material. The top rod is connected via a clip to an isometric force transducer. The bottom rod holds the trachea at a fixed position, and is mounted on a micrometer for adjustment of passive tension and/or muscle length. Contraction of the trachea creates tension on the force transducer, which is converted to a voltage signal at the preamplifier. The bottom rod may also be configured to include two rectangular platinum plates (4 mm apart) that flank the trachea (Figure 2B). The platinum plates are wired to a Grass S88 stimulator that allows delivery of an electric field across the trachea. Open wires and solder are coated with Sylgard (Sylgard 184 Silicone Elastomer, Dow Corning Corp, Midland, MI), to prevent leaching of metals into the bath solution.\nA/D converter, computer and acquisition software. Signals from the preamplifiers are recorded on a MacLab 8 A/D system. This is an older version of the current ADInstrument Powerlab hardware. We use the program Chart (ADInstruments) that allows continuous recording of tension throughout the experiment. Tension generation of trachea muscle is quite slow, and therefore we find that acquisition of 100 points per second is adequate. The tension measurement is calibrated using known weights (up to 5 grams) before each experiment. Similar systems are available from other venders (e.g., BioPac, GW Instruments).\n2. Trachea Isolation\nBefore tissue isolation the force transducer is calibrated with known weights, and the tissue bath is filled with normal PSS (see Table I). The air inlet is adjusted to obtain a light stream of O2/CO2.",
    "Tracheas from two month or older mice are optimal. Younger animals may be used but tracheas obtained from these require greater skill to mount on the force transducer wires because of their small size. Prior to dissection, mice are deeply sedated with isoflurane. The proper level of sedation is reached when a toe-pinch with forceps is unable to elicit a response. Mice are immediately sacrificed by cervical dislocation. An important note: We have observed that Avertin (Tribromoethanol), a sedative commonly used in mice, has strong relaxant effects on airway smooth muscle and therefore should not be used for trachea contraction studies.\nThe skin (and fur) is removed from thorax to throat. Ribs are cut from the base of the sternum, laterally (on both sides) to the top of the heart. The sternum and ribs are then pulled forward to the throat to reveal the heart/lungs, thymus, trachea (ventral) and esophagus (attached to - and dorsal to trachea).\nThe trachea is excised by cutting below the bronchial bifurcation and above the pharynx. The trachea is placed into an ice-cold oxygenated (95/5) PSS solution (composition given in Table I).\nThe trachea is dissected clean of surrounding tissues. During cleaning, the trachea can be held at the pharynx or below the bifurcation. However, caution should be taken not to directly apply the forceps to the trachea itself. Fine scissors may be used to cut off surrounding tissues, but the cut should always be made parallel to the trachea to avoid damage. This part of the procedure is facilitated if the trachea preparation is pinned below the bifurcation and above the pharynx onto a Sylgard-coated dish (Sylgard 184 Silicone Elastomer, Dow Corning Corp, Midland, MI).",
    "After removing surrounding tissue, the trachea is cut below the pharynx and above the bronchial bifurcation and gently mounted on the force transducer wires.\nThe trachea is threaded over two L-shaped metal prongs (Figure 2A). One prong is connected to a force-displacement transducer for continuous recording of isometric tension. Another prong is connected to a micrometer. The tissue bath is then raised so that the trachea is immersed in PSS. Mounting of the trachea should be done as quickly as possible to minimize the time that trachea are held outside of PSS. With practice, mounting of the trachea can be done within one minute but we generally avoid times longer than 3 minutes to avoid loss of viability.\nThe micrometer is adjusted slowly to obtain a passive tension of ~10 mN (~ 1 gram-force). The optimal resting tension was determined empirically and we have found that passive tension of ~ 5 - 10 mN results in an equivalent, maximal response to high potassium stimulation. This is consistent with a number of other studies that utilize a passive tension in this range16,17,18. Over the first 5-10 minutes, trachea passive tension tends to decline somewhat (stress-relaxation phenomenon) and the micrometer is used to adjust the passive tension to ~10 mN during equilibration. The trachea is allowed to equilibrate for at least 1 hour before experimental challenges.\n3. High Potassium Stimulation\nFollowing equilibration, the trachea is challenged twice with a high potassium PSS solution (67 mM KCl, Table I). The contraction generally requires ~ 5-10 minutes to reach steady-state at which time the tissue bath is rinsed several times with normal PSS to completely relax the trachea. The potassium contraction is repeated a second time, and a third time (if necessary) until reproducible contractions are obtained.\n4. Contraction Evoked by Electrical Stimulation",
    "The trachea is flanked by two rectangular platinum plates (electrodes) that allow electric field stimulation (EFS) to the preparation. The contractile response to EFS is a function of frequency and voltage. It is also affected by physical parameters such as the area of the electrodes and the distance between them. The power characteristics of the stimulator also affect responses such that at higher voltages and current outputs the stimulator can reach its maximum. The characteristics of any EFS system should be determined by examining the muscle contractile responses at differing stimulus durations, frequencies, voltages and pulse durations. For our experimental setup, we have found that electrodes separated by ~ 4 mm, and stimulation amplitude of 44 V (0.5 ms pulses) and 30 Hz are optimal to achieve reproducible near-maximal contractile responses.\n5. Contraction Evoked by Cholinergic Stimulation\nThe responsiveness of the trachea to exogenously applied compounds is evaluated either by addition of a single dose of the drug of interest or, by multiple additions of the drug in a cumulative dose fashion. For the trachea, our laboratory routinely used carbachol to activate cholinergic receptors because, unlike acetylcholine, carbachol is not degraded by acetylcholinesterase. A reasonable dose-response range is from 10-8 to 10-5 M carbachol. Fitting of the Log[carbachol]-contractile response curve with a Hill-type equation allows an estimation of EC50 (half-maximal effective concentration) that is a measure of sensitivity of tracheal contraction to the cholinergic agonist 19. It is worth noting that a given dose of carbachol will give a slightly greater response as a single dose than as part of a cumulative dose response curve.\n6. Representative Results",
    "An example of a contractile response to high potassium is shown in Figure 3A. The contraction reaches a maximum within approximately 10 minutes but may show a small decline thereafter. During early washout of high potassium, the muscle may show a transient increase in contraction that is due to a drop in temperature as the small volume of unheated PSS solution in the solution lines transiently perfuses the preparation. This can be minimized by having a minimum dead volume in the tubing connecting the heated PSS reservoir and tissue bath, and also by exchanging solution relatively quickly (generally we pump solutions at 100 ml/min). Each preparation will have some differences in contractile response due to differences in muscle mass or damage incurred during the dissection. Figure 3B shows two tracheas of different muscle mass challenged with high potassium and carbachol. Although the cholinergic-evoked contractions differ, they are similar after normalization to the response with high potassium solution (Figure 3C).\nFigure 4 shows an example of a carbachol (cholinergic) evoked contraction using single doses (A) and a cumulative increase (B). The carbachol solutions are added directly to the bath and the bubbled gas helps in rapid mixing. It is worth noting that addition of a single dose (i.e. 1 μM, Figure 4A) has a slightly larger response than the equivalent concentration during a cumulative dose-response curve (1 μM, Figure 4B). Figure 4C shows a plot of contraction force as a function of carbachol concentrations using data from Figure 4B. Effects of carbachol saturate at 10-5 M concentration. Although cholinergic agonists initiates contraction through calcium release mechanisms, a substantial component of the contraction is also mediated by depolarization and activation of voltage-dependent calcium channels 20.",
    "Figure 5A shows an example of EFS-evoked contractions. Tracheas are stimulated using 0.5 millisecond duration, 40 volt pulses until contractions reach a plateau (see inset a1). An increase in stimulation frequency causes an increased contractile response (frequency-response curve is plotted in Figure 5B). Electric field stimulation has been shown to evoke contractions predominantly by activating presynaptic nerves. This is evidenced by the effect of botulinum toxin, a blocker of neurotransmitter release that blocks the majority of the EFS-evoked contractions of trachea 21. Moreover, tetrodotoxin, an agent that blocks Na+ channels also inhibits nerve activity and eliminates the response of trachea to EFS.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3703/3703fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Diagram of the major signaling pathways in an isolated trachea preparation. Shown is a cholinergic axon terminal innervating a tracheal smooth muscle cell. The major signaling pathways are M3- and M2- muscarinic acetylcholine receptor activation (mACHR) that cause calcium release through IP3 receptors (M3) and reduction of cAMP (M2). M2 receptors (and some contribution of M3 receptors) also cause cholinergic-evoked depolarization that activates L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels and calcium influx. Common contractile agents and their effectors are 1. high potassium (depolarize smooth muscle cell and cholinergic axon), 2. electric field stimulation (EFS, depolarizes cholinergic axon) and 3. exogenous application of cholinergic agents such as acetylcholine or carbachol (activates muscarinic receptors directly).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3703/3703fig2.jpg",
