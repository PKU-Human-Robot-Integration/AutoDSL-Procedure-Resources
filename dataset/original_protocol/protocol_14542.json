    "This protocol was approved by the University of Maryland Institutional Animal Care and Utilization Committee (IACUC; Baltimore, MD, USA)\n1. Experimental Set-up\nMake a custom designed contact lens from a clear optical grade circular 7 mm in diameter Plexiglas, of 3 mm thickness. Cut the circular lenses with a drill press. Use a standard drill bit to make the inner curve, and finally polish the outer and inner curves using a contact lens polisher of ultrafine grit (1000/3000).\nPrepare 2.5 mM Rose Bengal (RB) in pH 7.4 phosphate buffer saline (PBS) in advance, filter sterilize with a 0.45 micron syringe filter and store 1 ml aliquots in -20 °C in a light-tight container for up to 6 months.\n\tNOTE: The use of albino outbred male animals, such as Sprague Dawley minimizes the strain dependent response differences, enables increased ease of induction and reduces the variability that can occur with estrus cycling female.\nSet up the frequency doubled Neodymium-yttrium aluminum garnet (Fd-YAG) ophthalmic medical laser, which generates a 532 nm laser light. Mount the laser on a Haag-Streit ophthalmic slit lamp using a standard ophthalmic laser adapter. This commercially available device enables simultaneous visualization of the animal's eye and laser spot application. The medical laser also has an aiming beam for proper focusing and centration using same spot size as laser induction. Laser power parameters are as follows:\n\t\nFor rat rNAION induction: use 500 µm spot size/50 mW laser power/1,000 msec duration/1,000 msec interval.\nFor mouse rNAION induction: change the spot size to 300 µm for smaller optic disc and leave other parameters the same as the rat setting.\nRoutinely use a laser power meter to assure the laser power output.\n2. Experimental Procedure",
    "Turn on the laser power and set up the appropriate laser parameter. Warm the laser for at least five minutes before use.\nWeigh the animal to determine the appropriate dose for ketamine/xylazine and RB dye. Anesthetize the animal by intraperitoneal injection of a 1 ml/kg mixture of 80 mg/ml ketamine and 4 mg/ml xylazine.\nLeave the animal in a heated cage until fully anesthetized. Check for no response to aversive stimuli (tail or toe pinch). Check animals for depth of anesthesia every 10 min.\nDilate the animal's pupils with 1% tropicamide and anesthetize the surface of the eye with 0.5% proparacaine. If using pigmented animals, such as Long Evans, a 2.5% neosynephrine ocular drops will increase pupil dilation.\nUse scissors to cut the whiskers close to the muzzle on the side to be induced to avoid blocking the view.\nPut a drop of 1% methylcellulose or other ophthalmic coupling drop to the inside of the custom-made contact lens, and then apply the lens onto the rat eye.\nPlace the animal on a platform adjusted to the height of the slit lamp. Set the animal's head at a 45° angle so that the eye is perpendicular to the slit lamp and laser beam.\nVisualize the eye through the ophthalmic slit lamp. Make sure the aiming beam is the right size as well as focused and centered directly on the visualized optic nerve. Photograph the retinal fundus using a digital camera with high ASA (1,200 - 2,000) speed mounted on one of the eye pieces of the slit lamp with a custom made adapter.",
    "NOTE: The ability to see the choroidal vessels reveals the transparency of the retina. This is an important sign in order to be able to detect later retinal ischemia, which can confound the interpretation if it occurs. rNAION is optic nerve ischemia, which results in isolated RGC loss, while retinal ischemia results in retinal damage affecting all of the cells of the inner retinal layers.\nOptionally, further image the retina and optic nerve using a spectral domain-optical coherence tomograph (SD-OCT8) to evaluate the un-induced eye. Scan en face (Figure 3B) as well as 7 cross-sectional scans through the retina (Figure 3C). The SD-OCT imaging uses the same contact lens used for laser induction.\nInject 1 ml/kg RB intravenously through tail vein, and wait for 30 sec, then activate the laser power. This time delay enables the RB to distribute evenly throughout the circulation. We use a 50 mW laser pulse at one sec/pulse.  Greater energies (≥ 60 mW) can damage the retina or cause retinal vascular ischemia.\nCaution: Make sure everyone has a pair of laser safety filtering glasses of the appropriate blocking wavelength to prevent stray laser light entering investigator's eye.",
    "NOTE: The laser administration must be given rapidly after the IV RB injection since the dye is eliminated quickly from the circulation. The longer the laser induction, the more severe the optic nerve ischemia. Generally, animals are given 7 - 12 sec pulses in a rapid succession. The contact of the laser light with the circulating dye gives the optic nerve vessels a beautiful golden glow that can be seen through the slit lamp (Figure 4B). This proves the dye was injected systemically and distributed into the blood stream. If the glow is faint, or none at all (Figure 4A), the dye was not injected intravenously. In this case, do not give a second injection immediately, since the animal will need to recover for at least two days before reinjection.\nImmediately after induction, remove the contact lens. Cover both eyes with ophthalmic triple antibiotic (Neosporin/polymyxin/bacitracin) ointment with dexamethasone, and place the animal on a 37 °C warming pad in a single housed cage under close observation until full recovery.\n\t\nClean the contact lens with distilled water and wipe dry with a non-abrasive cleaning cloth for future use.\nTwo days after the induction evaluate the optic nerve edema by both fundus color photography and SD-OCT analysis8.\n\t\tNOTE: Comparing the degree of optic nerve edema gives an estimate of the severity of the optic nerve ischemia. At two days, the optic nerve disk margin is blurred, and the retinal veins are slightly dilated, compared with the contralateral (un-induced) eye. Perform electroretinography (ERG) and flash visual evoked potential (VEP11) at two and four weeks post induction for electrophysiology analysis.\nSubscription Required.
