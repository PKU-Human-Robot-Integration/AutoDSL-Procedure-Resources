    "Preparation of plasmid single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)Transform 100-200 ng of plasmid DNA into 25-50 μl competent E. coli CJ236 bacteria. Use either heat-shock (1 min, 42 °C, heat-block) or KCM buffer (use the same volume of bacteria and a mix of 5x KCM buffer diluted 1:5 with water, ice/15 min, room temperature/10 min) for transformation. Add 50-200 μl S.O.C. medium and plate on LB plates containing 25 μg/ml Cmp and additional antibiotic matching plasmid resistance (usually 100 μg/ml Amp*, depending on plasmid), leave overnight at 37 °C.*Note: In theory, any plasmid containing f1-origin of replication can be used, such as lentiCRISPR v2 (Addgene 52961). The plasmid should have an antibiotic resistance gene other than Amp, Cmp and Kan. Next day, pick several single colonies of E. coli CJ236 with a sterile pipette tip, resuspend each into 1 ml of 2x YT medium supplemented with Amp* (100 μg/ml), Cmp (25 μg/ml) and 1 μl helper phage. Shake for 2 h (37 °C, 200 rpm); add 100 μg/ml Kan and continue shaking for 6-10 h (37 °C, 200 rpm).Transfer 1 ml of initial culture into 30 ml of 2x YT medium containing Amp* (100 μg/ml) and Kan (100 μg/ml) and shake 16-20 h (37 °C, 200 rpm).Transfer 30 ml bacterial culture into a 50 ml Falcon tube; centrifuge (10 min, 12,000 x g, 4 °C).Transfer phage-containing supernatant (Figure 2A) into 6 ml of sterile-filtered PEG/NaCl buffer, invert 4-6 times, incubate for 30-60 min at room temperature; centrifuge (10 min at 12,000 x g, 4 °C).Decant supernatant and aspirate the remaining supernatant.Resuspend phage pellet (Figure 2B) in 1 ml 1x PBS and transfer to a new 1.5 ml reaction tube.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191222/20191222000820_2873.jpgFigure 2.

After addition of ssDNA lysis buffer (turbid solution, turbidity reflects amount of phage).Centrifuge for 5 min at 16,100 x g to remove cell debris, transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 ml reaction tube and store at 4 °C.Purify ssDNA from phage supernatant according to the Omega Bio-Tek E.Z.N.A M13 DNA Mini Kit protocol.Determine ssDNA concentration using NanoDrop.Analyze ssDNA in a 0.8% TAE/agarose gel using 500 ng ssDNA and 250 ng of the respective dsDNA. The ssDNA should appear as a predominant single band (Figure 3A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191222/20191222000747_2242.jpgFigure 3. Quality control of ssDNA and 3Cs reaction products. A. ssDNA appears as a single band on an agarose gel and usually exhibits higher electromobility than its dsDNA plasmid counterpart. #1, #2, and #3 refer to example plasmids of different sizes. Low quality ssDNA exhibits multiple bands indicating phage-derived recombination products that will lead to poor performance during 3Cs (!). B. The 3Cs reaction product typically exhibits three bands on an agarose gel. All three electrophoreses were run on 0.8% 1x TAE agarose for 30 min at 110 V.Oligonucleotide phosphorylation with T4 polynucleotide kinaseIn a 1.5 ml reaction tube, combine 600 ng oligonucleotide pool with 2 μl 10x TM buffer, 1 mM ATP, 5 mM DTT and 20 units T4 polynucleotide kinase in a total volume of 20 μl; incubate for 2 h at 37 °C.Note: Oligonucleotide pools can be ordered from various commercial sources. Hand-pooled oligonucleotides generally lead to libraries with very variable gRNA distribution and should therefore be avoided.",
    "Annealing of the oligonucleotides to the templateMix 20 μg freshly prepared ssDNA with 25 μl 10x TM buffer (final concentration 1x TM) and 20 μl phosphorylated oligonucleotides in a total volume of 250 μl; incubate in a thermoblock as follows: 90 °C (3 min), 50 °C (5 min), room temperature (5 min).Note: Molar ratio between oligonucleotides and vector ssDNA should be determined experimentally and might be different for a particular plasmid. Usually, ratio ranges of 3:1, 5:1 and 7:1 are optimal for 3Cs reactions. Enzymatic synthesis of 3Cs-dsDNAAdd the following components to the previous mixture: 10 μl of 10 mM ATP, 10 μl of 100 mM dNTPs, 15 μl of 100 mM DTT, 3 μl of T4 DNA ligase (stock: 400,000 units/ml) and 5 μl of T7 DNA polymerase (stock: 10,000 units/ml); mix carefully by pipetting up and down or flicking the tube; incubate for 16 h at 22 °C.Purification of 3Cs-dsDNA with DNA Clean and Concentrator-5 KitMix the 3Cs reaction with 2x volume of DNA binding buffer and incubate for 10 min at room temperature.Divide the 3Cs reaction on 2 columns.Spin down (1 min, 2,300 x g, room temperature); re-spin each flow through twice.Wash column twice each with 200 μl wash buffer (1 min, 2,300 x g, room temperature).Discard flowthrough and dry the column (1 min, 7,400 x g, room temperature).Incubate column with preheated 10 μl of elution buffer (10 min, 50 °C), spin down at maximum speed (2 min), re-spin each flow through twice.Repeat elution with 20 μl flow through (final volume will be around 40 μl).Run a gel to control the quality of dsDNA alongside to ssDNA (Figure 3B).Determine concentration by Nanodrop.Electroporation of electrocompetent E. coli bacteria with 3Cs dsDNAPrepare 20 ml pre-warmed S.O.C. medium at 37 °C in a small Erlenmeyer flask.",
    "Incubate the entire purified 3Cs dsDNA and a 2 mm electroporation cuvette on ice.Thaw 400 μl of electrocompetent E. coli strain SS320 or NEB 10-beta bacteria on ice (20 min).Add the cells to the pre-chilled and purified 3Cs DNA and mix slowly by pipetting, avoid generating bubbles.For electroporation, use the following settings: 2.5 kV field strength, 25 µF capacitance, 200 ohms resistance (optimal duration: 3.8-4.2 ms).Place the dried cuvette into the electroporator holder.Transfer the mixture gently (without bubbles) into the cuvette and tap the cuvette (avoid air bubbles that lead to arcing!).Tightly close the holder, put the lid on the cuvette.Electroporation: press both buttons on the power supply at once, release once beeping starts (usually 3.8-4.2 ms).Immediately rescue the electroporated cells by rinsing in 2x 1 ml pre-warmed S.O.C. medium. Any delay will significantly decrease the electroporation efficiency.Incubate Erlenmeyer flask (with 20 ml S.O.C. medium and electroporated bacteria) for 30 min (37 °C, 140 rpm).Remove 40 μl of bacterial culture, keep for preparing serial dilutions.Note: In a 96-well plate prepare 3 columns (i.e., 3 x 8 wells) with 90 μl 1x PBS per library. Add 10 μl of bacterial culture into the first 90 μl 1x PBS (prepare in triplicate), use it for subsequent serial dilutions (1:10). Plate 5 μl of diluted bacteria on Amp* LB plate, incubate at 37 °C overnight. Calculate library diversity as follows: count colonies in a dilution where separate colonies are nicely visible and calculate the mean number of colonies per 1 μl diluted bacterial culture. Knowing the final volume of the bacterial culture (20.",
    "4 ml) and dilution from which colonies were counted (for example, lane 3 dilution in a 96-well plate corresponds to 103 dilution), calculate the library diversity: Diversity = (number of bacterial colonies in 1 μl diluted bacterial culture) x 10(dilution) x bacterial culture volume (μl). Transfer the remaining content of the small Erlenmeyer flask into 180 ml of pre-warmed 2x YT medium (with 100 μg/ml Amp*), shake overnight (37 °C, 140 rpm).Next day prepare a mini-prep from 5 ml of the overnight culture and use it to check library quality (see Steps G1-G3).Spin the remaining culture down (4 °C, 6,000 x g, 20 min) for subsequent midi-prep.Analysis of the pre-library by restriction enzymesDigest 0.5 μg pre-library dsDNA with the appropriate restriction enzymes; always use original vector as cleavage control as well.Load undigested and digested pre-library and original vector on 0.5-0.8% 1x TAE agarose gel.Check the quality of the pre-library and compare it with the original vector (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191222/20191222000713_0185.jpgFigure 4. Removal of wild-type remnants from pre-library preparation and quality control of final library. Restriction enzyme digestion of the wild-type plasmid, the pre-library, and the final library indicates the ratio of wild-type and 3Cs plasmids at each step. As control, the wild-type plasmid (wt plasmid) is linearized with either I-SceI or EcoRV. A double digest with both enzymes removes a fragment of approximately 2,500 bp as both enzymes cut the plasmid (!). In the pre-library pool, the incomplete digestion with I-SceI and the faint band resulting from the double-digest indicate the majority of DNA being 3Cs products. The double digest reveals a band at ~2,500 bp with a significantly lower intensity than in the wild-type plasmid pool. In the final library, the I-SceI digest reveals no visible linearized fragment.",
    "The double digest linearizes the library and shows no visible band at ~2,500 bp, indicating the final library to be free of wild-type plasmid. Electrophoresis was run on 0.8% 1x TAE agarose for 30 min at 110 V.Digestion of pre-library library prior final electroporationDigest 10-20 μg of the pre-library with the appropriate enzyme and purify by Clean & Concentrator Kit.Transform and process 5-10 μg of the cleaved pre-library into 400 μl electrocompetent bacteria as described under Steps F1-F12.Grow 200-1,000 ml of 2x YT-Amp* (100 µg/ml) bacterial culture (volume depends on library size, future needs and amount of remaining oligonucleotides) at 37 °C overnight.Next day spin down bacteria (prepare multiple aliquots of bacterial pellets from either 50, 100 or 150 ml bacterial culture, depending on the maxi-prep kit that you are using and size of your library).Prepare a maxi-prep from one bacterial pellet, keep the remaining pellets at -20 °C until needed.Analysis of the final library by restriction enzymesFollow Steps G1-G3 (Figure 4).Sequence analysis of the final library by Sanger sequencingSend appropriate amount (usually 700-1,200 ng) of the final library for Sanger sequencing. Choose a sequencing primer that is near your gRNA cassette, for example U6 primer. Representative data is presented in Figure 5.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191222/20191222000643_8463.jpgFigure 5. SANGER sequencing of final library. As a first quality control step, SANGER sequencing of the final library with the U6-primer reveals randomization at the I-SceI placeholder side. In this example, digestion of the final optimized truly genome-wide library (oTGW) from Wegner et al. (2019) results in a randomized nucleotide pattern resembling the intended sequence composition of that library.Sequence analysis of the final library guide distribution by next-generation sequencing (NGS)For a detailed description of data processing and data analysis we refer to Wegner et al., 2019, a brief overview of the procedures is described below."
