    "All animal work has undergone ethical approval by the King’s College London Ethical Review Process and was performed in accordance with UK Home Office Project License P8D5E2773 (KJL).\n1. Preparation of reagents\nPrepare general solutions and tools including sterile phosphate buffer saline (PBS), 70% ethanol, dissection tools (forceps and dissection blades or sterile needles), plastic plates or glass slides coated with a commercially available extracellular matrix (ECM)-based hydrogel or fibronectin (see the Table of Materials), and neural crest media (see below).\nPrepare the neural crest basal medium using Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, 4500 mg/L glucose), 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.1 mM minimum essential medium nonessential amino acids (MEM NEAA 100X), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 55 µM β-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 units/mL streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine.\n\t\nCondition the media overnight using growth-inhibited STO feeder cells21.\n\t\t\nPrepare STO cells (see the Table of Materials) media to contain DMEM supplemented by 10% FBS and 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 U/mL streptomycin. Grow and expand STO cells to confluence in 25 cm2 flasks coated with 0.1% gelatin. Apply 5000 rad of gamma irradiation.\nSeed approximately 3 x 106 growth-inhibited cells onto a 10 cm2 dish or 25 cm2 flask (from step 1.2.1.1). Add approximately 10–12 mL of neural crest basal medium and incubate overnight.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Seeded cells can be used to produce conditional medium for up to 10 days. Check appearance of cells regularly\nFilter the medium (0.22 µm pore size), and supplement with 25 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and 1000 U of leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF).\n\t\tNOTE: Store at 4 °C and use within a month or store at -20 °C and use within 3 months.\nCoat the tissue culture surfaces with extracellular matrix.",
    "NOTE: Depending on the biological question being asked, the matrix can be coated onto glass-bottomed culture dishes, plastic tissue culture dishes or glass cover slips. See below for differing ECM based hydrogel dilutions dependent on the matrix substrate. Fibronectin has been tested on glass-bottomed dishes and cover slips only at the concentrations specified below. Here on, we will refer to the substrate-coated surfaces as “coated plates”.\n\t\nCoat the tissue culture surfaces with ECM based hydrogel.\n\t\tNOTE: Keep the substrate cold until plating, either by cooling the media or keeping on ice.\n\t\t\nThaw the hydrogel at 4 °C overnight. Add 5 mL of 10% FBS in DMEM to 5 mL of hydrogel for a final volume of 10 mL (see the Table of Materials).\nMake 0.5–1 mL aliquots as convenient and store at -20 °C.\nThaw the hydrogel aliquots on ice.\nUse a 1:20 dilution of the hydrogel stock to coat plastic.\nUse a 1:5 dilution of the hydrogel stock to coat glass slides and glass-bottomed tissue culture plates.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Dilute the hydrogel in cold DMEM.\nApply enough diluted hydrogel to cover the desired area on to plates/slides and incubate for 30–45 min at 37 °C.\nUse coated plates/slides immediately or store coated slides at 4 °C overnight.\nRemove excesses and rinse slides with high glucose DMEM (optional) before use.\nCoat the tissue culture surfaces with fibronectin.\n\t\t\nMake aliquots of 1 mg/mL fibronectin stock solution and store at -80 °C. Dilute fibronectin with Dulbecco’s PBS (dPBS) to a final concentration of 1 µg/mL.\nApply sufficient fibronectin to cover the desired area and incubate at room temperature for 15 min.\nRemove residual fibronectin and allow the glass to dry for 30-45 min.\nRinse wells or cover slips with high glucose DMEM (optional) before use.",
    "2. Day 1: Dissection of early somite stage embryos\nNOTE: Use sterile tools and sterile solutions. If genotyping is needed, collect the body of the embryo for DNA extraction.\nDissection of the cranial neural plate is restricted to embryos at 8.5 days post coitum (dpc). Select embryos at the 5–8 somite stage. Dissect the uterus into PBS and cut the mesometrium to separate each embryo (Figure 1A). The muscular wall of the uterus contracts and the decidual tissue will become visible (Figure 1B).\n\tNOTE: Maintain embryos in the uterus in ice-cold PBS while dissections are performed one embryo at a time. Move embryos with a glass Pasteur pipette into fresh sterile PBS to improve visibility and reduce contamination.\nSlide forceps between the muscle layer and decidual tissue and remove the muscle layer with a second pair of forceps (Figure 1C).\nUsing forceps, pierce the deciduum at the edges of the mesometrial pole and with a second pair of forceps tear to open perpendicularly to the pole.\nPeel back the decidual tissue with the forceps to visualize the Reichert’s membrane.\nRemove Reichert’s membrane carefully. The visceral yolk sac becomes visible and the embryo can be seen inside (Figure 1D).\nRemove the visceral yolk sac and the amnion (Figure 1E) and position the embryo in order to visualize the head fold (Figure 1F).\nCut the head fold above the heart and scrape away the underlying mesoderm using forceps and/or eyelash tools to obtain a clean neural plate (NP) (Figure 1H).\n\tNOTE: The NP can be kept whole or divided down the anteroposterior axis so that each side can be plated individually. The neural plate border can be further trimmed away from the neural plate in order to minimize neuronal contributions to the explants.",
    "Use a glass Pasteur pipette to transfer the dissected neural plate onto a hydrogel-coated dish filled with conditioned neural crest media.\nGently swirl the dish to position the NP in the middle of the well. This is important for maximizing the phase quality for live-cell imaging (on day 2).\nIncubate overnight (or to desired time-point) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Neural crest cells should be visibly migrating out of the neural plate.\n\tNOTE: Cells usually attach within 6–8 h. After the explant attaches, allow more time to visualize migrating cells. Usually by 24 h post explant, we can find three distinguishable populations of cells. The first population, at the center of the explant, is the neural plate (NP). The second population, the premigratory NC (pNC), surrounds the NP in an epithelial sheet of cells. The third population, in the outside ring, is formed of migratory NC (mNC), which are bigger in size, and appear fully mesenchymal (Figure 2).\n3. Day 2: Live cell imaging of murine cranial neural crest cells\nNOTE: Imaging should be performed at 24 h post explanting to optimally image and quantify neural crest cell migration. NC induction media does not need to be refreshed before live cell imaging. Access to an inverted microscope, with a motorized stage and an incorporated environment chamber is required. Use multi-well tissue culture dishes suitable for imaging (Table of Materials).\nMicroscope set-up\nSet the environment chamber at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nPierce a hole into the lid of the tissue culture plate lid to allow the CO2 needle, connected to the CO2 humidification chamber, to sit within the plate.\nPlace the tissue culture dish into the specimen holder and tape down the plate lid and CO2 needle to prevent shaking during multi-well acquisition.",
    "Switch on the microscope controller, the stage controller and the imaging software.\nFocus on the cranial NC cells at 10x magnification (with matching phase ring in the condenser selected).\nSet high quality phase-contrast on the microscope by adjusting the field iris diaphragm, aperture iris diaphragm and centering telescope, as specified in the microscope set-up manual.\nPhase contrast live-cell imaging\nSet the directory or file location where the time-lapse files will be saved.\nSet the exposure time, binning, and camera area.\nSet the number of time points, duration of imaging and time interval between frames.\n\t\t\nTo quantify NC cell migratory capacity, set the microscope to 10x magnification, taking 1 frame every 5 min (217 time points over 18 h). To quantify cell morphology, set magnification to 40x, taking 1 frame/min (61 time points over 1 h). To quantify lamellipodial dynamics, set magnification to 40x or 60x magnification, taking 1 frame every 10 s (over 10 min).\nFor multi-well imaging, set the mechanical stage to move between selected XY positions of interest. Confirm that the cranial NC cells are in focus and the stage positions are correct.\nUse the Acquire command to start time-lapse imaging.\nOnce time-lapse imaging is complete, review the multidimensional data and export .stk files for analysis.\n\t\tNOTE: .stk is a TIFF stack file.\nExit the software, shut down the computer and turn off the stage, camera and microscope controllers.\n4. Imaging analysis: quantification of neural crest cell migration",
    "NOTE: To better define the cellular behaviors exhibited by migrating murine cranial neural crest cells, we have analyzed a series of quantifiable migratory parameters, specifically focusing on migratory capacity and cell shape dynamics. (1) Migration (accumulated distance) is the total path length taken by the cell (µm); (2) Migration (Euclidean distance) is the straight-line distance between initial and final position of cell (µm); (3) Migration (cell speed) is distance traveled by cell per unit of time (µm/min); (4) Cell Shape (cell area) is the total surface covered by cell. Set pixel to micron scale according to imaging microscope. (A = Apx x Npx, where Apx = pixel area and Npx = number of pixels. Units: µm2; (5) Cell shape (cell circularity) is the deviation of cell shape from a perfect circle which is indicated by a circularity value of 1.0 (4π (A/P2)) where A = area and P = perimeter.\nSingle cell tracking\n\tNOTE: To measure NC cell migration, XY coordinates of individual cells across all time-lapse frames are generated. This allows for subsequent analysis of distance, speed and persistence measures of cell migration.\n\t\nOpen ImageJ and import data as TIFF stack files.\nClick Analyze | Set Scale to calibrate the .stk files according to microscope settings, working in pixel/μm.\nClick Plugins | Tracking | Manual Tracking to open Image J manual cell tracking plugin. To begin cell tracking, select Add track.\nTrack cells through all frames of time-lapse movies, using the nucleus as a reference point.\n\t\tNOTE: 10–20 cells should be tracked per explant, with a total of 60 cells tracked (n = 3). Cells that undergo cell division during the course of time-lapse should be excluded from analysis.",
    "Save and export the results as a .csv file. Results represent individual cell track number, slice number and XY coordinates over all frames.\nQuantification of neural crest cell migratory capacity\nOpen single cell tracking data (see above). Convert .csv files into .txt file format.\nOpen the migration software (the Table of Materials). Click the Import Data tab to import the cell tracking data as a .txt file.\nUnder Datasets | Initialization, select the number of slices or frames to be analyzed and set the XY calibration and time interval between frames. Select Apply settings to save the settings.\nSelect the Plot Data symbol to form trajectory plots. Select the Statistics symbol to quantify distance and speed measures.\nSave the trajectory plots as bitmap (.bmp) files, and distance and speed measures as .txt files. Select the Remove Data symbol. Repeat for other time-lapse files.\n\t\tNOTE: Trajectory plots can be used to visualize the directness of individual cell paths for a given cell condition or state over the course of time-lapse movies (Figure 4A). Distance and speed data stored in the .txt files can then be used for further analysis.\nQuantification of neural crest cell area and circularity\nOpen the time-lapse .stk files in ImageJ and calibrate according to microscope settings, working in pixel/µm.\nUnder Analyze | Set Measurements, click to select the cell shape parameters: cell area, perimeter and shape descriptor.\nUse the Freehand Selection tool to manually draw around each cell, using cell membrane boundaries as a guide.\nPress Ctrl + B keys on the keyboard to maintain the cell outline overlain on the image. Repeat for cells over each time-lapse frame.\nUse the Image | Overlay | To ROI Manager to store the values.",
    "Once all cells of interest per frame have been outlined, click Measure. Save the results as a .csv file.\n\t\tNOTE: 10–20 cells per movie should be outlined, with a total of 30–60 cells analyzed per condition (n = 3). Cell shape data (.csv files) can be used to quantify how cell shape dynamics change over time (Figure 4C) or how morphology may be altered under different cell treatments."
