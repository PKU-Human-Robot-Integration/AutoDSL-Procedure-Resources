    "This protocol describes preparation of a fungal spore suspension for PCR. If spores are already harvested, the user should proceed to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.89#cpmc89-prot-0002].\nA. fumigatus spores are obtained from solid agar cultures grown on Sabouraud agar (SAB) at 37°C for 2 to 3 days. Growth conditions for other fungal species may vary. Subsequently, spores are harvested in PBS–Tween 20 solution (with or without 20% [v/v] glycerol) and at this stage they are ready to be used as a PCR template or can be stored at 4°C.\nMaterials\nSAB agar (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.89#cpmc89-rec-0002]) or fungal species–specific growth medium\nFrozen stock of fungal spores\nPBS–Tween 20 solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.89#cpmc89-rec-0001])\n25-cm2 vented tissue culture flasks (growth flasks; e.g. Corning, 430639)\nPlastic, disposable inoculation loops\n37°C incubator (for A. fumigatus; temperature may vary for other fungal species)\nMiracloth (Merck) or equivalent sterile filtration material\n15- or 50-ml conical tube (e.g., Corning Falcon) for spore suspension\nAdditional reagents and equipment for counting using hemocytomter (see Current Protocols article: Stevenson, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.89#cpmc89-bib-0006])\n1. Pour SAB agar into 25-cm2 vented tissue culture flasks to cover the surface and let it set.\n2. Defrost fungal spores and spread them on top of SAB agar in the tissue culture flasks using a plastic, disposable loop. Incubate for 2 to 3 days at 37°C until a sufficient amount of spores are observed.\nFor A. fumigatus, the most common solid growth media used are SAB agar and Aspergillus complete agar, and optimal incubation temperature is 37°C. The growth medium and temperature may vary between fungal species, and specific conditions should be used for these species to generate spores. Some fungal species may also require light for spore formation.\nCulturing filamentous fungi in vented tissue culture flasks as opposed to Petri dishes significantly reduces contamination and risk of spore dispersion in the air.",
    "3. Harvest the spores by pouring approximately 10 ml of 1× PBS–Tween 20 (with or without 20% [v/v] glycerol) solution into the growth flasks; mix well.\nTween 20 is a nonionic detergent/dispersing agent commonly used in spore preparation (alternatively, Tween 80 can be used). It makes the dispersion of hydrophobic spores in PBS easier.\nThe described spore PCR protocol also works well for spores suspended in PBS–Tween 20 solution containing 20% (v/v) glycerol. This solution is usually used to preserve the spores at −80°C.\n4. Pour the PBS–Tween 20-spores solution through a sterile filtration material such as Miracloth into a 15- or 50-ml conical tube.\n5. Optional: Count the spores using a hemocytometer or any other cell counter (see Current Protocols article: Stevenson, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.89#cpmc89-bib-0006]).\nIf large numbers of strains are being tested, as for high-throughput experiments, spore counting may be problematic and can be omitted. In this case, we recommend continuing with the protocol, as in our hands PCR amplification has worked from spore supernatants from as few as 7.8 × 105/ml and as many as 8 × 108/ml A. fumigatus spores.\nWe have not tested the spore template range (i.e., lowest and the highest spore concentrations) for other fungal species.\n6. At this stage, spores are ready for spore PCR (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.89#cpmc89-prot-0002]), or they can be stored at 4°C.",
    "Following spore harvest (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.89#cpmc89-prot-0001]), the spore suspension is subjected to extreme temperature treatment in order to make the genomic DNA accessible for PCR. No mechanical treatment is required.\nMaterials\nSpore suspension (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.89#cpmc89-prot-0001])\nPrimers (5 µM each, forward and reverse; experiment specific)\nLongAmp Taq DNA polymerase with 5× reaction buffer (New England Biolabs; M0323)\ndNTP mix (5 mM of each dNTP)\nSterile, molecular-grade water\nFor agarose gel electrophoresis (also see Current Protocols article: Voytas, 2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.89#cpmc89-bib-0007]):\n               \n6× DNA loading dye\n1× TAE buffer (see recipe)\nEthidium bromide or other DNA gel stain\n0.2-ml PCR tubes, 0.2-ml/well 96-well PCR plates, or 150 µl/well 384 well PCR plates with tight (preferably aluminum) seals\nThermal cycler\nCentrifuge\nUV transilluminator\nAdditional reagents and equipment for agarose gel electrophoresis (see Current Protocols article: Voytas, 2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.89#cpmc89-bib-0007])\n1. Transfer 30 µl of previously prepared spore suspension (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.89#cpmc89-prot-0001]) to 0.2-ml PCR tubes or PCR plates and seal tightly (preferably using aluminum seals).\nThe spore suspension should be mixed thoroughly before transferring to the tubes or plates.\n2. Incubate the tubes or plates with the spore suspension at 95°C for 15 min in a thermal cycler.\nA water bath or 95°C incubator can also be used.\n3. Immediately transfer the tubes/plates to an −80°C freezer and leave for approximately 10 min (to perform thermal shock).\nSteps 2 and 3 are critical for subsequent successful PCR amplification. We have noticed that a better PCR yield is obtained if the spore suspension is immediately transferred to −80°C from 95°C.\n4. Defrost the spore suspension at room temperature.\n5. Centrifuge for 1 min at maximum speed to remove cellular debris and keep the supernatant for PCR.",
    "Following the thermal shock (steps 2 and 3), the spore suspension can also be used directly as PCR template, omitting the centrifugation step; however, we observed a slightly better PCR yield if the spores are centrifuged and only the supernatant is used for PCR. For some fungal species, centrifugation of spores may be necessary to avoid transferring cell debris into the PCR reaction and to prevent inhibition during PCR reaction.\n6. Prepare the following PCR mixture in PCR tubes or PCR plates. The following volumes are per one reaction:\n         \n1 to 3 µl of thermally treated spore suspension supernatant\n1 µl of 5 µM forward primer\n1 µl of 5 µM reverse primer\n5 µl of 5× LongAmp Taq DNA reaction buffer\n0.5 µl of 2500 U/ml LongAmp Taq DNA polymerase\n0.5 µl of dNTP mix\nMake up to 25 µl with sterile, molecular-grade water.\n7. Place the tubes/plates in a thermal cycler and use the following PCR conditions for the LongAmp Taq DNA polymerase:\n         \ntable:\n﻿0,1,2\n1 cycle:,1 min,95°C\n35 cycles:,20 s,95°C\n,20 s,55°-60°C\n,50 s/kb expected PCR product,65°C\n1 cycle:,5 min,65°C\nFor most ∼20-bp primers, the annealing temperature between 55°C and 60°C is sufficient to amplify a PCR product using the LongAmp Taq DNA polymerase and the conditions specified.\nSuccessful PCR amplification has also been obtained with a Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs; M0530; see Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.89#cpmc89-fig-0001]A). This polymerase was tested in the following PCR conditions for PCR products of ∼1.2 kb: 1 cycle at 98°C for 30 s followed by 35 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 58°C for 20 s, 72°C for 45 s, and finally 1 cycle of 72°C for 5 min.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9ee0d5bb-7a87-4d04-abc9-9325c2b23e88/cpmc89-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1",
    "PCR to test the efficiency of polymerases in amplifying PCR products from supernatants from different spore concentrations of the A. fumigatus wild-type strain with primers ITS1/D2 (expected PCR band sizes is ∼1.2 kb). (A) Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). (B) MyTaq RED Mix DNA polymerase (Bioline). P: positive PCR control amplified from genomic DNA (50 ng) of the A. fumigatus wild-type strain; N: negative control (no DNA).\n8. Following the PCR, mix 5 µl of the PCR reaction with 1 µl of 6× DNA loading dye and load the reactions on an agarose gel (Voytas, 2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.89#cpmc89-bib-0007]).\nThe gel concentration depends on the size of the amplified product. For gels between 600 bp and 1.5 kb, we use a 1.5% agarose gel.\n9. Analyze the stained gel under the UV light in a UV transilluminator for the presence/absence of the expected-size PCR products."
