    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis section describes how to set up the actual dynamic microfluidic single-cell experiment after preparations are completed. The preparations in “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]” can be applied to multiple dMSCC experiments, as long as the chip design does not change.\nSeed train\nTiming: 20 h\nThis step describes the preculture procedure for each microfluidic cultivation experiment. A reproducible seed train from the working cell bank to the chip seeding ensures reproducible starting conditions for microfluidic cultivations.\nCritical: Do not refreeze a glycerol stock once thawed. It is possible to prevent thawing by keeping the glycerol culture on dry ice.\nFor the preculture, inoculate 10 mL CGXII-medium in a 100-mL-baffled shaking flask from a glycerol stock aliquot and incubate over night at 30°C on a shaker at 120 rpm.\nFrom the preculture, inoculate the main culture at an OD600 of 0.05–0.1. Incubate the main culture on a shaker at 30°C for 3–4 h, until the OD600 increased by at least a 1.5-fold.\nNote: Inoculate the main culture before preparing the microfluidic chip and the media for the optimal temporal workflow.\nLive-cell imaging\nTiming: 1 day, 3 h hands-on-time\nThe aim of this step is to start the dynamic microfluidic cultivation and the time-lapse live-cell imaging.\nTurn on the temperature control of the microscope cage (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A). Let the objects inside the cage warm up, so that no temperature-based material expansion takes place during measurement.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2902-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Experimental set-up for dynamic microfluidic single-cell cultivation\n(A) This photo shows the complete experimental set-up at the microscope. Note, that the tubing needs to be sufficiently long (approx. 80 cm), that it will not put any tension on the chip during stage movement (step 10.a).",
    "(B) The chip is connected via hollow needles to the pressurized reservoirs and the waste. Place a tissue beneath the needles to soak up any potential leakage. Take care, that the needles and tubing do not obscure the imaging region.\n(C) Optimally, one single bacterial cell is caught in the center of the chamber after the loading is finished. The scale bar in C is 10 μm.\nPrepare the flow periphery (step 10), the medium (step 11) and the microfluidic chip (step 8 and 9).\nConnect the periphery and place the mounted chip as shown in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A.\nGive a drop of immersion oil on the 100× oil objective (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B).\nPlace the chip mounted on a holder on the microscope’s stage and fixate the holder.\nCritical: If the holder is not properly fixed, this will result in a shifting region of interest during live-cell imaging.\nNote: We use a self-fabricated holder that has a cut-out in the size of our glass substrate. We tape our chip to the holder from below (see Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]). If you use a similar system, take care to tape the chip to the holder on its entire perimeter. This prevents possible leakage to flow into the microscope. Furthermore, the tape should be on the very edge of the chip (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A). Otherwise, the immersion oil touching the edges will move along the tape on touch. This thins the oil film, leading to focus problems during live-cell imaging.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2902-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. The microfluidic chip is attached to the bottom side of the holder using adhesive tape",
    "(A and B) The tape should stay clear of the cut-out window (A). The chip should not be taped as depicted in (B), as this will lead to contact of the adhesive tape with the immersion oil film, resulting in focus problems.\nCritical: Not all immersion oils are suitable for longer (> 4 h) imaging, increasing in viscosity with time and thus leading to focus problems. If you use a different oil than proposed in this protocol, try its performance during a longer imaging session first.\nLoad the cells into the microfluidic chambers.\nFill a 1-mL-syringe with the bacteria suspension from the main culture.\nIf the OD600 exceeds 0.3–0.4, dilute it accordingly using medium.\nConnect the syringe to the loading tubing and fill the tube with suspension.\nInsert the needle connected to the syringe with the suspension into the outlet (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C) of the microfluidic structure.\nFlush the structure very gently with suspension and remove emerging droplets from the inlets with a tissue.\nCheck at least 10 chambers across the control and switching zones to see, if enough chambers contain an adequate number (1–4) of cells (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]C).\nAfter loading, do not remove the drops formed on the inlets.\nNote: If the number of chambers with loaded cells is too low, flush a little more forcefully in a pulsating manner, so that the flexible PDMS is raised slightly. If the loading is still insufficient, insert an air bubble into the channels and move them back and forth along the chamber arrays. An air bubble can be inserted via the outlet by reversing the flow or via the inlet by re-inserting the needle without a drop on the needle’s tip.",
    "Optional: Remove any cells present in the channels and inlets by flushing the chip with a syringe of medium. Insert the medium-needle into the outlet. This procedure decreases the risk of inlets overgrowing with bacteria during the cultivation.\nStart the pumps with a pressure of 15–20 mbar.\nWhen the first drop of medium forms at the needle tip, insert the needles into the inlets.\nNote: Merging the drops on the needle tip and the inlet will assure an air bubble-free connection. Air bubbles in this stage of loading will most likely lead to overcrowding of the chambers (Figure 14[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig14]A).\nIncrease the pressure of the pumps to the level that has been chosen as pressure pair of flow profile P1 in step 14.\nAttach the outlet tubing when the first drop forms on the outlet.\nFixate the tube’s end to the waste container using tape. Make sure, that all tubing is not under tension.\nCenter and focus the light path using Köhler illumination and adjust the phase ring according to the manufacturer’s manual[href=https://www.microscope.healthcare.nikon.com/resources/posters/kohler-illumination-and-phase-contrast-alignment-on-the-nikon-ti2].\nSet the phase contrast channel with a light intensity of 10% and the exposure time of 100 ms for the acquisition.\nAdjust the frequency of acquisition to 10 min.\nSearch for chambers with one to four cells in both control regions and the switching zone and save the positions for time-lapse imaging.",
    "Note: Depending on the number of positions, the experiment’s duration, the acquisition frequency and the number of fluorescent channels, a lot of hard drive storage space will be needed for the data. Depending on the field of view one image has a size of approx. 12 MB. For an experiment observing one channel for 20 h with images taken every 10 min for 80 positions, 115 GB will be necessary. The size can optionally be significantly decreased by acquiring only the region of interest (the chamber with an additional radius of 10–15 μm) and not the whole field of view.\nNote: The image frequency depends strongly on the research question. As we analyze the growth of C. glutamicum, which has a medium-dependent growth rate of 0.46–0.61 1/h,8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] we acquire an image every 10 min to have approx. 10 images per division.\nStart the acquisition and the pump program (step 15) at the same time.\nCritical: Check the running experiment for focus loss after 1 h. Readjust the focus if necessary.\nEnd the acquisition after the planned experiment duration and tidy up.\nStop the image acquisition and the pump program.\nOptional: After finishing the experiment, you can check the spatial flow profile to see, if the experiment was subjected to technical flaws. Turn off the pumps, exchange one medium reservoir with an ink reservoir. Turn the pumps on and set the pressures according to flow profile P1 and P2. Observe the critical regions for the correct spatial flow profile (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). This works best with dark ink.\nDiscard the chip and the tubing. Both will be inactivated by autoclaving.\nDetach the needles from the tubing and collect them in isopropanol.\nOnce enough needles are collected, place them in ultrasonic bath for 90 min.",
    "Discard the isopropanol and rinse the needles with ddH2O water.\nRemove any loose syringe adapters, as the isopropanol dissolves the glue.\nPlace the needles in water in an ultrasonic bath for 90 min.\nDiscard the water and repeat step 14.c.iv.\nAutoclave the needles in a glass petri dish for sterilization.\nRemove the oil film from the objective’s lens with a soft tissue. Wipe the objective with an isopropanol-soaked tissue afterwards.\nClean the pressure caps and the tubing adaptors by washing them with dH2O.\nImage pre-processing\nTiming: 3 h, 30 min hands-on-time\nThe aim of this step is to extract the usable data and prepare the images for further systematic image and data analysis. As a lot of digital storage space is required for time-lapse live-cell imaging, it is sensible to discard data that is not entirely usable.\nDiscard data not fit or necessary for the analysis during the cropping process in the microscope software.\nNote: Some cells might get washed out of the chamber during the experiment. The data for this position cannot be used for cell number-based analysis or cell tracking. In this case, it can be discarded.\nNote: If you chose to record the whole field of view, you can crop the edges of the acquired picture, so that only the chamber but not the channel is visible. This can decrease the image size by 50%.\nSave the image sequences in a usable file format for data analysis.\nNote: We use OME-TIFF stacks or Nikon-specific nd2 stacks, which are saved by using the command “split multipoint”. Each stack contains the image data of one chamber.",
    "We have the experience that the automated cell detection works best if no refraction from the chamber structures is visible in the region of analysis (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]). Therefore, we pre-process the images using Fiji and a self-tailored macro (you can find the macro in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]). The macro’s steps can also be applied manually, as described in the following steps.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2902-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. Data pre-processing\nThe raw data can be stabilized, rotated and cropped for further processing and analysis.\nChoose a region on the PDMS as reference for stabilization. The scale bar is 10 μm.\nStabilize the movement of the images in a stack. We have good experience with using the plugin “Image Stabilizer”[href=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Ekangli/code/Image_Stabilizer.html] with a reference area on the PDMS structures.\nRotate the chamber so that is straight.\nCrop the image stack so that no refraction from the chamber is visible anymore.\nSave the stack as TIFF file.\nDiscard data not fit or necessary for the analysis during the cropping process in the microscope software.\nImage analysis\nTiming: 3 h, 30 min hands-on-time\nNote: In this section, we showcase one possible way to detect and count microbial cells from live-cell imaging pictures using a FIJI macro, which can be found in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]. It applies k-means clustering and watershed algorithms prior to detection with “Analyze particles”. This macro is specialized in detecting bacterial cells that are evenly dark in a phase contrast picture and it works best if cells have a bright halo in the picture to be clearly distinguishable from each other. It is simple to install and to use.",
    "For some bacteria, it can be sensible to use other available tools for cell detection, like Omnipose10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] that can be integrated into FIJI using the “PTBIOP” plugin[href=https://github.com/BIOP/ijl-utilities-wrappers]. For tracking cells in time, you can use TrackMate in FIJI or a python environment11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] which offers a wide band of detection options and tracking algorithms. An alternative tool for segmentation and tracking of bacteria in a python environment is DeLTA.12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] For tracking single cells in time, we recommend higher image frequencies (e.g., every 2 min) for better tracking results.\nWorking in FIJI, load the image stack from step 37.\nOpen the macro “colony segmentation” (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) by dragging the file into FIJI.\nSet the initial image analysis parameters (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2902-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10. Image analysis using a colony segmentation macro in FIJI\n(A) The analysis parameters like cell size, cell circularity and the region to analyze can be set in the beginning of the analysis.\n(B) The colony segmentation macro binarizes the phase contrast picture by applying k-means clustering, thresholding and an adjustable watershed algorithm. The latter should be set to split cells that are still counted as one, as can be seen in the red box.\n(C) The binary mask is then analyzed with “Analyze particles” to detect the cells. Cell detection sometimes misses a cell (red box). For this example, 849 cells were detected by the macro, failing to detect 7 and under-segmenting 4 cell pairs.\nDraw a region of interest around the colony. You can also choose to analyze the whole chamber but note that this will take longer to analyze.\nPress “Run” in the macro editor.",
    "Set the boundaries for circularity and area for cell detection. Tick “Average values per frame” and “Single-cell values”. If you experience difficulties in detection of cells, increase to number of clusters. Press “ok” to continue.\nIn “Set Measurements”, select the values that you want to have measured. Mean gray values are especially important for the analysis of fluorescence data. Press “ok” to continue.\nCreate a binary mask for cell detection (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]B).\nAfter clustering, the macro will request you to set a threshold. The threshold result should look like Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]B. Press “ok” to continue. If the macro segments the background and not the cells, check if the box “black background” is ticked under Process > Binary > Options.\nThe macro will prompt you to set the adjustable watershed for splitting cells that were wrongly connected during clustering (see red box in Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]B). Low values will split more cells, higher values less. You can use the preview to find the right value before continuing.\nDetect the cells with “Analyze Particles” (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]C). Some cells might not be counted (see red box in Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]C). You can either count them by hand with the multipoint tool or re-run the macro with different settings in clusters and detection boundaries (step 41).\nSave the results table for further analysis."
