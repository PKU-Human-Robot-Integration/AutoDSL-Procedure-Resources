    "Consent was obtained for the use of pancreatic tissues for research from the deceased's next of kin and an authorization by the University of Wisconsin-Madison Health Sciences Institutional Review Board was obtained. IRB oversight is not required because it does not involve human subjects as recognized by 45 CFR 46.102(f).\nCAUTION: Care should be taken when handling the reagents used in this protocol, which include acids (formic, acetic, trifluoroacetic), bases (ammonium hydroxide), and cryogens (liquid nitrogen). Read the safety data sheets for the reagents used to become familiar with the associated hazards and needed precautions. Concentrations denoted using percentages are volume/total volume (v/v) and are diluted with water.\n1. Tissue cryo-pulverization, lysis, and protein extraction\nFill a dewar with liquid nitrogen. Pre-chill the parts of the tissue pulverizer that will come in contact with the pancreatic tissues, namely, the chamber, pulverizer, and recovery spoon in a polystyrene container.\nTransfer the frozen tissue pieces into the pre-chilled sample holder and add a spoonful of liquid nitrogen to the tissue.\nPlace the pulverizer into the chamber and strike it using a mallet five to ten times to crush the sample. Remove the pulverizer from the chamber and scrape off adherent tissue powder and pieces.\nAdd a spoonful of liquid nitrogen to the chamber if tissues begin to melt. Repeat the pulverization process until the sample is a fine powder without large tissue chunks. Portion the samples into approximately 100 mg aliquots into pre-chilled tubes.\nPrepare lysis buffer containing 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 150 mM NaCl, and 25 mM Tris (pH = 7.4). Dissolve one tablet each of protease and phosphatase inhibitor in 500 µL of water for a 20x stock of each. Add the required volume of 20x stock of each inhibitor to the lysis buffer for a final 1x concentration.",
    "Add 600 µL of lysis buffer per 100 mg tissue to the tube and incubate at 95 °C in a heating block for 10 min with shaking at 800 rpm. Remove the samples from the heating block and let them cool to room temperature.\nSonicate the samples at 60 W energy (20 kHz) for 45 s using 15 s pulses with a 30 s rest in between. Pellet the samples at 3,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.\nAdd the supernatant to a 5x precipitation solvent, 300 µL of lysis buffer to 1.5 mL of precipitation solvent, containing 50% acetone, 49.9% ethanol, and 0.1% acetic acid. Chill overnight at -20 °C.\nPellet the samples again at 3,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C and remove the supernatant. Wash the pellet by breaking up with a spatula and mixing with the same amount of precipitation solvent. Pellet again, repeating the washing step 2x.\nPellet the sample at 16,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. Air dry the sample pellet in a fume hood for 15 min and store at -80 °C until ready to proceed.\n2. Protein digestion and desalting\nResuspend the protein pellet in 300 µL of freshly made digestion buffer containing 50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) and 8 M urea.\nEstimate the protein concentration of the solution using a protein assay according to the manufacturer's protocol.\nTo the protein in the solution, add dithiothreitol (DTT) to a final concentration of 5 mM, mix, and reduce at room temperature for 1 h. Then, add iodoacetamide (IAA) to a final concentration of 15 mM, mix, and alkylate at room temperature for 30 min in dark. Quench alkylation by repeating the addition of DTT in the same volume as before and mix.",
    "Add LysC/trypsin at 1:100 enzyme:protein ratio and incubate at 37 °C for 4 h. Then, add 50 mM TEAB to dilute the 8 M urea used to < 1 M. Add trypsin at 1:100 enzyme:protein ratio and incubate at 37 °C overnight.\nQuench the digestion with the addition of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to 0.3% v/v. For every 1 mg of starting protein, condition a desalting cartridge (1 cc, 10 mg) with 1 mL of acetonitrile (ACN) and 3x with 1 mL of 0.1% TFA.\nLoad the digested mixture onto the desalting cartridge. Wash the mixture 3x using 1 mL of 0.1% TFA. If the elution is slow, apply positive pressure but avoid a flow rate > one drop per second.\nElute peptides using 1 mL of 60% ACN and 0.1% formic acid (FA) solution.

Portion the peptides into 500 µg aliquots and dry completely.\n3. ERLIC N-glycopeptide enrichment\nNOTE: Exact centrifuge speeds and times may differ based on samples and must be optimized. In general, 300 x g for 2 min is appropriate for conditioning and washing of the material and 100 x g for 5 min for eluting.\nWeigh approximately 3 mg of cotton wool and pack it into an empty 200 µL pipette tip (spin-tip; see Table of Materials).\nTransfer strong anion-exchange enrichment material into a tube and add 200 µL of 0.1% TFA per 10 mg material.

Dual-functional Ti(IV) simultaneous enrichment\nNOTE: Exact centrifuge speeds and times may differ based on samples and must be optimized.

Nano-flow reversed phase liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (nRPLC-MS)\nNOTE: MS data acquisition and analysis methods are diverse, and thus only one suggested LC-MS pipeline (and its associated parameters) is described here in the following steps. Samples generated using the previously outlined sample preparation and enrichment steps can be analyzed using other instrumental set-ups, including using commercially available chromatographic columns, given sufficient data quality.",

MS data analysis\nNOTE: One data analysis pipeline using two different software to analyze the same dataset is presented here. Phosphorylation and glycosylation can be searched at the same time using a single software instead of two separate software as described here, though in general, software search time is proportional to the search space, i.e., number of PTMs considered. For this reason, two different software are used in parallel to the search for glycopeptides and phosphopeptides.\nProcess raw data files using the appropriate software (see Table of Materials).",
