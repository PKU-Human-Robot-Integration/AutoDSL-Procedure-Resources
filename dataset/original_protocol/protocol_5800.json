    "Deprive 8-week-old mice of food for 24 h: 24 h before the test, remove all chow pellets from the home cage. Check inside the cage to remove any pellet fragments that may be scattered within the cage. Do not remove the water bottle.Note: During standardization, we tried using 6-week-old mice and had ambiguous results. 8-week-old mice or older should be used for the behavioral tests because 6-week-old mice are still considered juvenile and show a larger variability in behaviors.On day 2, it is advisable to acclimate the mouse to the room in the testing cage in the same conditions of the test, before the insertion of the pellet. Acclimation should last as long as the test will last and the animal should be taken out of the cage before the insertion of the pellet.Initiate the test by burying a 2 g pellet of regular chow 8 cm beneath the surface of the fresh bedding in one of the corners of the test cage. Transfer the mouse from its home cage back into the test cage, in the opposite corner in regard to the pellet. The time from its introduction into the test cage until it finds the food pellet is recorded as the latency (Video 1). The digital stopwatch should be halted as soon as the mouse touches the pellet of chow. If an animal is not able to find the food pellet within 10 min, the test is terminated and the latency is recorded as 600 sec. Importantly, for each subject, a clean cage, clean bedding, and new pellet of chow should be used.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1.

    "It is important to control for motivation in food-seeking behavior. This can be done with either the unburied food-seeking test (Li et al., 2013) or other motivation and locomotion tests (Machado et al., 2017). The unburied food-seeking test is the simplest way to control for motivation. It can be done using either parallel control groups (groups that undergo the unburied food-seeking test at the same time that the test groups undergo the buried food-seeking test) or the same animals used in the buried food-seeking test, after one week. The unburied food seeking test is the same as the buried food-seeking test, with exception to the pellet being on the surface of the bedding, instead of buried. Therefore, this test does not depend on olfactory cues and controls for motivation level among groups.Notes: In the eventuality of an animal escaping the cage during or immediately before the test, exclude this animal from the experiment.In Machado et al. (2017), while testing for behavioral differences through olfactory impairment, three groups were used: the test-group (conditional knock-out, n = 9) and two control groups (wild-type, n = 9; and heterozygote mice, n = 6). The test-group showed longer latency in retrieving the food pellet, in comparison to the control-groups (WT 143.1 ± 30.2 sec; Het 188.3 ± 24.5 sec; cKO 378.5 ± 76.3 sec; p = 0.02, F(2,15) = 4.54, one-way ANOVA and Dunnett post-test). It is important to note that in this article, we acclimatized the mice to the experimentation room, but not to the cage. It is possible that further acclimation to the cage may render more intensely different latencies between groups (Figure 2). Additionally, in this study we did not perform the unburied food-seeking test because we evaluated motivation and locomotion through the open-field, light/dark, elevated plus-maze, and tail suspension tests.",
    "In order to evaluate possible differences between male and female mice, the three groups used in Machado et al. (2017) were initially divided in genders: wild-type (4 males and 5 females), heterozygote (3 males and 3 females) and conditional knock-out mice (4 males and 5 females). However, after initial statistical analysis, we observed no differences between genders, so the final results contain both genders in each group. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180614/20180614222133_5715.jpgFigure 2.
