    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nEstablishment of Mouse Pancreatic Tumor Organoid Culture\nTiming: 24 h\nMouse pancreatic tumor cells are isolated from the tumor bulk of KPC mice (Kras+/LSL-G12D; TrP53+/LSL-R172H; Pdx1-Cre) (Hingorani et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). The KPC mouse model develops PDA with 100% penetrance, yet the development of tumors is not synchronous, and the presence of overt carcinoma should always be confirmed by histological analysis. As a general rule, pancreas tissue is collected from mice (between 2.5 and 3 months of age), which show a solid lesion by ultrasound imaging (for details of ultrasound imaging see section “Ultrasound imaging”).\nFor tissue collection, euthanize the mice using an approved method, and then dissect out the tumor rather than the entire pancreas. The tumor mass will appear as a white and stiff lesion as opposed to the soft and well vascularized normal pancreatic tissue.\nIn a petri dish, cut the tumor tissue in halves with a scalpel.\nPlace one half of the dissected tumor in a pre-labeled histological cassette and then move the cassette in a container of 10% formalin to fix for histology.\nPlace the other half of the dissected tumor in a 50 mL conical centrifuge tube containing 5 mL of Spitting medium. Keep the tissue on ice until ready for processing.\nPause Point: Mouse tumor tissue can be stored at 4°C for up to 48 h in Splitting medium to which FBS has been added to the final concentration of 1%.\nWarm up 24-well cell culture plate(s) for 12–14 h in the 37°C incubator.\nPlace Digestion solution in a 37°C water bath to warm up; move frozen Matrigel aliquots on ice to thaw.",
    "Note: Matrigel should be stored in a −20°C freezer. Allow enough time for your Matrigel aliquot to thaw on ice before use. An 1 mL aliquot of frozen Matrigel takes ∼1 h to thaw on ice, and a full vial takes ∼8 h.\nTransfer the tissue to a petri dish. Examine the tissue macroscopically and record the shape, size, weight, and morphological characteristics such as the amount of fat and/or necrosis content.\nMince tissue into pieces of 1 mm3 using sterile scalpels.\nTransfer the minced tissue to a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube and add 10 mL of ice-cold wash medium.\nLet the tube stand at 20–25°C for 1–2 min. If present, fat will rise to the top and float on the surface, while pancreas tissue material will sink.\nRemove and discard the medium containing fat and leave ∼1 mL of Wash medium with pancreas pieces. Be careful not to aspirate pancreas pieces.\nAdd 9 mL of pre-warmed digestion solution.\nPlace the tube on a rotator at 37°C for an initial digestion of 4 h and for a maximum of 16 h.\nCheck the digestion by sampling 10 μL of the digestion solution and spotting it in a petri dish. Observe the material under an inverted microscope and if several clusters of cells are visible (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]), stop the reaction by placing the tube on ice and adding 5 mL of ice-cold Wash medium.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/94-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Digestion of Mouse Pancreatic Tumor Tissue with a Mixture of Collagenase/Dispase\nAn ideal digestion of mouse pancreatic tumor tissue. Scale bar, 100 μm.\nNote: If clusters of cells are not visible, continue with digestion and check every hour (when possible).\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 200 × g at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and add 10 mL of ice-cold Wash medium.",
    "Centrifuge for 5 min at 200 × g at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant leaving the pellet behind, add 1.5 mL TrypLE supplemented with 15 μL DNase I (10 mg/mL) to the pellet, pipette up and down with 1 mL pipette tip to break large clumps, and incubate in a 37°C water bath for 5 min (no more than 10 min).\nNote: Every 5 min, pipette up and down with 1 mL pipette tip to break large clumps.\nPipette the suspension with 1 mL pipette tip for 10 times to ensure that large clumps are broken down.\nCheck the status of the enzymatic digestion by sampling 10 μL of the suspension and spotting it in a petri dish. Observe the material under an inverted microscope and, if several clusters of cells are visible (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]), stop the reaction adding 10 mL of ice-cold Wash medium.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/94-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Example of Ideal Cell Clusters Post Enzymatic Digestion\nScale bar, 100 μm.\nSpin down at 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Without disturbing the pellet, carefully remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in Matrigel. Usually, the pellet from 10 mg mouse tumor tissue is resuspended in about 200 μL of Matrigel.\nSpot 50 μL Matrigel dome for each well of a 24-well plate.\nNote: The volumes described are applicable for 24-well plate. Scale-up accordingly if using different culture conditions, as indicated in the table below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_94_6.csv\nCarefully move the plate into a 37°C tissue culture incubator until Matrigel solidifies (∼15 min).\nAdd Rho Kinase Inhibitor (RhoKi, 10.5 mM stock solution) to mouse complete medium to a final concentration of 10.5 μM.",
    "Bring the plate back to the hood and add 500 μL of pre-warmed Mouse complete medium supplemented with RhoKi to each well of the 24-well plate containing Matrigel domes. Carefully move the 24-well plate to the 37°C cell culture incubator.\nPost Derivation\nTiming: 24–72 h\n24 and 48 h after plating, observe the Matrigel domes under the microscope and take images using 4× and/or 10× objectives. Organoids should start forming within 1–2 days from isolation.\nMake sure to complete histological analyses within few days using the tissue that has been fixed for histology. Tumor histology must be confirmed on tissue section.\nMouse complete medium is usually refreshed every 3 days after seeding, and cultures are passaged when:\nobtaining a dense culture (for example, see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/94-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Example of a Dense Organoid Culture (∼80% Confluency)\nAn ideal organoid culture ready to be split. Scale bar, 500 μm.\nobtaining large organoid structures (more than 20% of the diameter of a 50 μL Matrigel dome)\nMatrigel softens and the dome tends to detach from the plate\nNote: RhoKi is added to the mouse complete medium only for culture initiation, i.e. when plating the dissociated tissue and for the first refreshing of the medium. There is no benefit for maintenance of the culture by adding RhoKi to the mouse complete medium.\nPassaging\nTiming: 45 min\nPassaging is performed with a split ratio of 1:4 to 1:8, every week depending how fast the organoids grow.",
    "In order to check for a possible contamination from KRAS wild type cells, standard protocols can be used to assess for the presence of non-cancerous cells (see section “Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]”). For culture expansion, we suggest using 6-well plates as collection and passaging of organoids is easier and less time consuming as compared to the use of smaller vessels (e.g., 24-well plates). However, the procedure described below is the same regardless the vessel size.\nPlace Mouse complete medium in a 37°C water bath to warm it up; move frozen Matrigel aliquots on ice to thaw.\nAspirate medium from each well and add 3 mL of ice-cold Splitting medium to each well of the 6-well plate.\nPipette the liquid up and down until the Matrigel falls apart and the solution is homogeneous.\nTake the mix of organoids, Matrigel, and Splitting medium and move the solution to a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube previously filled with 6 mL of ice-cold Splitting medium.\nRinse each well of a 6-well plate with 1 mL of ice-cold Splitting medium to collect any leftover and transfer it into the 15 mL conical centrifuge tube (total volume at this point should be 10 mL).\nNote: Repeat this procedure for the remaining wells. Harvest up to 8 Matrigel domes per 15 mL conical centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the tube at 100 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant until 1.5 mL of volume and add 1 mL of ice-cold Splitting medium.\nPipette up and down with a sterile fire-polished pipette and resuspend the pellet ∼10 times to shear the organoids.\nAdd Splitting medium to bring the volume to 10 mL and invert the tube a couple of times to resuspend the solution.",
    "Spin down at 100 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Without disturbing the pellet, carefully remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in Matrigel. The volume of Matrigel depends on the density of the organoids and the chosen split ratio. As an example, if starting from two wells of a 6-well plate (16 individual domes) and the required split ratio is 1:4, then add 3.2 mL of Matrigel to the organoid pellet.\nNote: Each dome requires 50 μL Matrigel, so when splitting with a 1:4 ratio (from 16 domes to 64 domes), the total volume of Matrigel required is 50 μL × 64 = 3,200 μL (3.2 mL)\nSpot up to 8 individual Matrigel domes of 50 μL into each well of a pre-warmed 6-well plate.\nCarefully place the plate into a 37°C tissue culture incubator until Matrigel solidifies (typically 15 min).\nBring the plate back to the hood and add 3 mL of pre-warmed Mouse complete medium to each well of the 6-well plate containing Matrigel domes.\nCarefully move the 6-well plate to the 37°C cell culture incubator.\nNote: Mouse complete medium is usually refreshed once a week after passaging.\nMouse Pancreatic Tumor Organoids Dissociation\nTiming: 2 h\nFor transplantation of tumor organoids into the pancreas of a recipient mouse, a suspension containing 1,000,000 single cells is prepared starting from 8 domes in one well (400 μL of Matrigel, one well of a 6-well plate), each having ∼80% confluency (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nPlace Dispase solution in a 37°C water bath to warm up; move frozen Matrigel aliquots on ice to thaw.\nNote: Dispase solution must be warm when you add it to Matrigel domes.\nIn the cell culture hood, aspirate medium from each well, and add 3 mL of pre-warmed Dispase solution to each well of a 6-well plate.",
    "Return the plate to the incubator for 20 min.\nPlace Splitting medium and DPBS on ice.\nFor organoid collection, prepare 15 mL conical centrifuge tubes each filled with 6 mL of Splitting medium and place them on ice.\nNote: A maximum of 8 Matrigel domes, corresponding to one well of a 6-well plate, are generally collected in one tube.\nUsing a 1 mL pipette tip, pipette up and down the Dispase solution to dislodge the Matrigel and shear the organoids in each well of the 6 well-plate.\nTransfer the Dispase solution containing the organoids from one well (∼3 mL) to an ice-cold 15 mL conical centrifuge tube filled with 6 mL of ice-cold Splitting medium.\nRinse the well with 1 mL of ice-cold Splitting medium to collect any leftover and transfer it into the same 15 mL conical centrifuge tube (total volume at this point is 10 mL).\nNote: Repeat steps 51–52 for the remaining wells using different tubes.\nSpin down the organoids for 5 min at 200 × g at 4°C.\nCarefully remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of TrypLE.\nNote: Aspirate carefully, keeping the tip of the aspirator pipet at the top of the liquid.\nOptional: Before resuspension in TrypLE, perform additional washes with ice-cold Splitting medium until the organoids sediment efficiently as a white pellet at the bottom of the tube. If organoids appear dispersed throughout a layer of Matrigel gel in the tube, then continue with washes.\nPipette cells up and down through a 1 mL pipette tip, looking for a reduction of visible particle size.\nIncubate the tube in a 37°C water bath for 10 min, shaking every 3 min.",
    "Add 2 mL of Dispase solution to the 15 mL conical centrifuge tube (containing 1 mL of TrypLE) and pipet up and down the solution ∼4 times with 1 mL pipette tip to make a single-cell suspension.\nNote: At this step, the addition of dispase will ensure complete digestion of any leftover proteinaceous materials (from previous Matrigel digestion), which will impair the successful obtainment of a single cell suspension.\nAdd 30 μL of the 10 mg/mL DNase I Solution to digest the DNA released from dying cells.\nIncubate the tube in a 37°C water bath for an additional 10 min, shaking every 3 min.\nUsing 1 mL pipette tip, pipette up and down the cell suspension ∼4 times to make a single-cell suspension.\nOptional: Increase incubation time to 15 min if dissociation is not complete. Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] shows an example of successful dissociation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/94-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Dissociation of Mouse Pancreatic Tumor Organoids\nA single cell suspension after enzymatic treatment. Scale bar, 10 μm.\nQuench with 7 mL of ice-cold Spitting medium (the tube now contains approximately 10 mL of solution).\nSpin down the cells for 5 min at 200 × g at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant and re-suspend the cells with 1 mL of ice-cold Splitting medium.\nNote: Conical centrifuge tubes should be maintained on ice all the time.\nCount and evaluate the number of live cells using available methods. For example, mix 10 μL of cell suspension with 10 μL of trypan blue solution (0.4%). Load 10 μL of the mixture to the hemocytometer. Count and calculate live cells concentration.\nDilute cells in ice-cold DPBS to a final concentration of 1,000,000 live cells/mL and transfer 1 mL of the cell suspension in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nSpin down the cells for 5 min at 200 × g at 4°C.",
    "Remove supernatant and re-suspend cell pellet with 33 μL of Matrigel and 17 μL of ice-cold PBS for a total volume of 50 μL. Store cell suspension on ice.\nRepeat steps 65–67 in two separate tubes and combine the 50 μL cell suspension from these two tubes into one tube for a total of 100 μL cell suspension.\nCritical: The cell number required for each injection is 1,000,000 live cells/50 μL. It is ideal to prepare 2,000,000 live cells in 100 μL per Eppendorf tube for each injection since a little volume of solution will be retained by the syringe needle after each injection.\nIsograft Generation\nTiming: 20 min\nAnesthetize the transplant host (B6J mice) using methods approved by your Institutional Committee, e.g., 4% isoflurane; when the mouse is asleep (approximately 2–3 min), put it on the right flank on the operative field.\nNote: Keep the mouse sedated for the entire procedure, e.g., with 2.5%–0.5% isoflurane.\nRemove the fur from the left flank using the rodent shaver, and then apply a thin layer of depilatory cream using a cotton stick and leave it for approximately 3 min.\nNote: Do not keep depilatory cream on mouse skin more than 3 min; it may cause skin irritation.\nClean the shaved area with a wet tissue and then with 70% alcohol.\nUsing dissecting scissors, practice a small incision (∼1 cm) in the flank by first cutting the skin and then the peritoneum.\nUsing iris forceps, gently lift the spleen to expose the pancreas.\nKeeping the cell/Matrigel mix as cold as possible, resuspend single cell suspension with 200 μL pipette tip and slowly draw up 100 μL of the cell suspension through the needle of a 0.5 mL insulin syringe.",
    "Critical: Carefully resuspend cells to avoid formation of bubbles. At this point it is important to remove air from a 0.5 mL insulin syringe before taking the required volume.\nWarm the syringe content by holding it for approximately 30 s so that the Matrigel will begin to solidify; then, clean the needle using 70% alcohol before the injection.\nCritical: Do not warm the syringe for more than 30 s, otherwise the suspension cannot be injected as Matrigel completely solidifies.\nUsing iris forceps, hold the spleen so that the pancreas will be in a vertical position and slowly inject 50 μL of the single cell suspension into the pancreatic tail (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]); if the injection is performed correctly, a small bubble will be visible at the injection site.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/94-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Schematic Representation of the Injection of a Solution Containing Single Cells from Organoid Culture into the Pancreatic Tail\nCritical: It is important to avoid any leak, otherwise tumor cells will spread and grow outside the pancreas. To avoid leaks, it is important to inject the solution slowly. Avoid applying too much pressure while injecting.\nUsing a cotton stick, gently clean the injection site.\nGently reposition the viscera into the peritoneal cavity using forceps.\nUsing the needle holder and the VetSuture FastPGA, suture the peritoneum.\nApply clips with the autoclip applier to close the skin wound.\nGently position the mouse in the housing cage and keep it under a red light to warm it up, until it completely recovers from the anesthesia following approved post-surgery care procedures for the animals.\nTumor Growth Monitoring\nPrior to proceeding to tumor growth monitoring, remove external clip using the autoclip remover.\nNote: Wound closure requires approximately 10–15 days.\nAbdominal Palpation\nTiming: 3 min",
    "To check for the presence of a palpable mass, perform weekly abdominal palpation following the described procedure.\nHold the mouse from the tail and place it on the grid of the cage.\nGently palpate the abdomen with the thumb and the index finger moving backward and forward for a solid mass feeling.\nCritical: Don’t confuse mouse feces with tumor mass; this procedure is difficult to reproduce and subjective. Please, use ultrasound imaging to dispel any doubts (see below).\nUltrasound Imaging\nTiming: 20 min\nTo effectively measure tumor mass and volume, and monitor tumor growth over time, available methods should be used. For High-resolution micro-ultrasound imaging system - Vevo 2100, follow the protocol described below.\nTurn on the imaging system following the manufacturer’s instructions and switch on the heating pad (∼37°C).\nFor abdominal imaging, choose B-mode imaging since it is the most suitable to locate anatomical structures.\nApply ultrasound gel on the transducer head.\nAnesthetize the animal with 4% isoflurane; when the mouse is asleep (approximately 2–3 min), put it on the right flank on the operative field and keep it sedated for the entire procedure with 2.5 % isoflurane.\nRemove the fur first with the help of the rodent shaver and then apply the depilatory cream with the help of a cotton stick (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). After 3 min, remove the cream with a wet tissue.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/94-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Fur Removal from Mouse Flank with Depilatory Cream\nNote: Do not keep depilatory cream on mouse skin more than 3 min; it may cause skin irritation.\nApply ultrasound gel on the flank of the mouse and get the transducer in position.\nNote: Do not perform heavy compression on the mouse flank.\nTo localize the tumor, scan backward and forward trying to localize the spleen, and then the pancreas.",
    "Note: Pancreatic tumors are usually visualized as hypoechogenic formations. During the progression from pre-invasive lesions to carcinoma, transplants grow as small cystic structures (spherical structure with clear borders), and then they become full solid structures (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/94-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Ultrasound Image of Tumor Mass\nUpper panel: ultrasound image of a tumor mass with cystic appearance.\nLower panel: ultrasound image of a full solid tumor mass (red circle).\nOnce the tumor mass is identified, using the ultrasound caliber find the two extremities of the mass. Place the transducer at the same distance from the start/end of the tumor and scan the entire tumor mass.\nNote: This step is important to measure tumor volume.\nAt the end of the procedure, remove the ultrasound gel from the mouse abdomen and place the animal in a recovery cage.\nOnce the scan is over, track two diagonal lines to measure the mass (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/94-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Tumor Mass Measuring\nExample of tumor mass measuring using micro-ultrasound imaging.\nTo measure volume with the Vevo Imaging Workstation, click on 3D settings and select Volume.\nSelect Parallel from the Volume area and then Start to start creating the first contour; proceed by drawing subsequent contours both inward and outward to measure the total volume of the tumor mass.\nOnce generated the desired number of contours, click on Finish to end the procedure and obtain the volume. Volume measurement should be performed once a week.\nNote: When tumor volume reaches the size of approximately 1 cm3, mice should be euthanized, and tissues harvested.\nNecropsy\nTiming: 20 min\nAnesthetize the animal using approved methods (e.g., 4% isoflurane) and, once asleep, euthanize the mouse according to approved methods. For example, put the sedated mouse supine on the operative field and practice cervical dislocation to euthanize the mouse.",
    "With the curved forceps, hold the skin in the center of the abdomen and cut it with the curved scissors performing an “upside-down V” (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]); perform the same procedure with the peritoneum.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/94-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. Performing an Upside-Down V Cut during Necropsy\nCheck for the presence of a tumor mass attached to the pancreas.\nUsing the forceps, pull out the intestine and collect pancreas; if a visible tumor mass is present, gently detach it from the pancreas.\nPlace the pancreatic tumor tissue in a petri dish, which has been previously tared on a digital scale, and record the weight of the pancreas\nCut the pancreas tumor in halves with a scalpel.\nPlace one half of the pancreas in a pre-labeled cryotube and flash-freeze in liquid nitrogen. Then store the samples in −80°C until needed.\nPlace the other half of the dissected tumor in a pre-labeled histological cassette and fix for 12–14 h with a 10% formalin solution (fixative volume should cover completely the tissue).\nCritical: Make sure to cut the mass carefully. If it is a cystic mass, ensure wearing personal protective equipment to avoid exposure to splashes.\nCollect organs which are potential site of metastasis, such as liver and lungs.\nProperly dispose of the carcass according to institutional guidelines.\nNote: For paraffin processing of Tissue and Haematoxylin/Eosin Staining proceed according standard Protocols."
