    "This protocol has been performed using human embryonic stem cells \\(hESCs), neonatal rat ventricular myocytes \\(NRVMs), and KMBC cholangiocarcinoma cells.\n1. On Day 1, plate cells at a concentration of 1 million cells / mL.\n  2. 24 hours after plating, switch to serum-free or EV-cleared media.\n  3. Collect supernatant after 24 hr \\(hESCs) or 48 hr \\(NRVMs or KMBCs).\n  4. Centrifuge at 500 x g for 10 min.\n  5. Transfer supernatant to a fresh tube and centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 10 min. \n  6. Store cell-free supernatant at -80Â°C."
