Picture demonstrating the brain removal, dentate gyrus (DG) dissection, and DG digestion Poly-L-ornithine/Laminin coating of cell culture plates layer Add the appropriate volume of Poly-L-ornithine (PLO) solution (20 μg/mL) into cell culture well plates to completely cover the surface (1.5 mL for 6-well plates, 450 mL for 24-well plates, and 60 μL for 96-well plates) (see Recipes).Incubate at 37 °C for 2 h.Tilt the plates and remove the PLO by pipetting at the corner of each well, then add the appropriate volume of PBS (1×) to each well (2 mL for 6-well plates, 1 mL for 24-well plates, and 100 μL for 96-well plates), and incubate for 2 min. Wash and incubate with PBS (1×) three times.Add laminin so that its concentration in each well is 5 μg/mL, and incubate overnight (16 h) at 37 °C.Use the plates immediately before letting them dry. It is optional to wash each well with PBS (1×) before seeding cells. Seed the cells 1–2 min after removal of laminin or after washing with PBS (1×).Harvest rat brain tissue (Figure 2) imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4843/bioprotoc-13-19-4843-g002.jpgFigure 2.

    "The same procedure for the left one was performed. L. Two hemispheres are depicted. M and N. Removal of frontal bones using rongeur is shown, starting at the site of the interfrontal suture and continuing to cut small fragments of bones. O. Frontal parts of the brain have been accessed. P and Q. Separation of the brain from the skull was carried out by inserting a round spatula at the edges of the exposed brain and moving laterally in backward and forward motions and detaching the nerves through sliding the spatula beneath the brain. R. Scooping the brain out, it was transferred into a 50 mL Falcon tube containing 3–5 mL of cold PBS (1×) containing 3% Pen/Strep and 1% Amphotericin B kept on icy water.Use two separate sets of sterile surgical tools to reduce the risk of contamination with hair and blood. One set for harvesting brains from adult rats and another for microdissection of the dentate gyrus from the brain. If the following steps are performed correctly, the brain is isolated from the skull without any damage.Anesthetize rats using intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of a mixture of ketamine (80 mg/mL, i.p.) and xylazine (10 mg/mL, i.p.) (see Recipes) according to the following stages:Prepare the anesthesia solution.Lift the rat from the home cage and cover its head with a towel. Place it quietly on the cage lid to grasp its bars and become immobilized.Grasp with one hand near the neck of the rat under the forelimb while holding the tail with the other hand. In this situation, the rat’s head is kept immobilized. Lift upward the shoulder and expose the abdomen, then inject anesthesia solution (i.p.) on the lower right quadrant of the abdomen.Cut the neck close to the head (decapitation) with a rodent guillotine.",
    "Sterilize the head, dissection area, and surgical tools by spraying 70% alcohol.Hold the head in place with the lateral parts (temporal bones) between two fingers.By using fine scissors, cut the skin out at the middle of head by a single transverse cut and retract the skin. Separate remaining muscles and tissues at the base of the skull with large scissors. Start removing bones from occipital to frontal parts.Remove the supraoccipital bones over the cerebellum with the rongeur until it is exposed.Now open the bones over the hemispheres in sequential steps: firstly, place the flat blade of a pair of scissors beneath the right parietal plate and force from the inside to drive away from the brain. Separate the left parietal plate in the same way.Proceed rostrally, and remove the frontal skull plates by rongeur, starting from the site of the interfrontal suture. Remove bones to expose frontal parts of the brain (see Note 1).To remove meninges, pierce fine scissors into the interhemispheric fissure and with a fine forceps take away the meninges over the hemispheres.Loosen the exposed brain laterally in forward and backward motions with a round spatula.Insert spatula inside of the skull floor and slide it to push brain away from the skull, cutting attached nerves with the same spatula, then invert brain immediately into a 50 mL Falcon tube containing 3–5 mL of cold PBS (1×) with 3% Pen/Strep and 1% Amphotericin B on water ice. Observation of the whole brain without any damage indicates its intact structure.DG microdissection (Figure 3) imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4843/bioprotoc-13-19-4843-g003.jpgFigure 3.

Removal of the diencephalon inside of each hemisphere (indicated by a black line). J. The hippocampus inside of the cortex is visible. Middle part indicated by a black line is the dentate gyrus. K, L, and M. Hippocampus was separated from brain tissues by inserting a spatula at the isolating border and releasing into the dissection area. N. Hippocampus under stereomicroscope. O. Insertion of the spatula into the hippocampal fissure to isolate the dentate gyrus. P. Dentate gyrus (indicated by a black line) is observed in the center.Place a Petri dish lid on the top of ice under a stereomicroscope.Cover the Petri dish with filter paper and rinse it completely with 2 mL of cold dissection solution. Place an illuminator on the right side and focus it on the dissection area.Transfer the isolated brain from a 50 mL Falcon tube onto the dissection area using curved forceps and rinse it with dissection solution (2 mL for each brain).Roll the brain onto its ventral surface. Firstly, by using a scalpel, cut off the cerebellum while holding the brain with forceps, and then cut the brain along the sagittal plane into two hemispheres.Turn over each hemisphere upward to view the medial side and hold them in place using forceps.Initially, remove the diencephalon inside of each hemisphere at the center by inserting a spatula at the inner border of the fornix and diencephalon, and then sliding the spatula from posterior to anterior, finally removing the diencephalon.Now the hippocampus is visible on the medial side. Separate cortex overlays from the hippocampus throughout the corpus callosum with spatula.",
    "Isolate the hippocampus from the septo-temporal direction and detach it from other brain tissues with spatula, then turn over the entire hippocampus onto the dissection area. Cut the remaining fragments of cortex and white matter tissue.To dissect DG from the hippocampus, refocus the microscope, and observe the hippocampal fissure (in some rats it is not as visible).In most brains, a blood vessel in the hippocampal fissure, the hippocampal arteriole, is apparent and serves as a landmark to separate the DG from the CA1 area. The DG is in the middle area when the hippocampus is observed from the medial plane. While holding the hippocampus in place using forceps, slide along the hippocampal fissure with a fine spatula to cut the DG off, then transfer it to the microtube containing 1 mL of cold PBS (1×) or DMEM/F12 (1:1).DG tissue dissociation (Figure 4) imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4843/bioprotoc-13-19-4843-g004.jpgFigure 4.

Cell suspension is visible, looking milky. J. Pellet of single cells after centrifugation is shown.Transfer the microtube containing DG tissues under a laminar hood.Empty the pieces of DG into a Petri dish under the laminar hood and add 1 mL of PBS (1×) containing 1% Pen/Strep antibiotic for two dentate gyruses to wash the tissue twice, aspirate the solution out of the Petri dish, and add 500 μL of PBS (1×) to cover the tissue. Keep tissue fragments wet.",
    "Use a sterile scalpel to cut the tissue up and mince it completely for 2–3 min according to the tissue amount. Rotation of the Petri dish during mechanical digestion makes dissociation more uniform. Cut 1 mm of the initial segment of 1 mL pipette tip with a scalpel to broaden the hole of the tip and fill it with tissue fragments.Transfer minced tissue into a 50 mL Falcon tube containing pre-warm Papain (0.5 mg/mL), Dispase (2 mg/mL), DNase (0.02 mg/mL) (PDD) enzyme solution and incubate at 37 °C under shaking (150 rpm). Use 1 mL of enzyme solution for each animal.Incubate in an enzyme solution as follows: for young adult rats, 10–15 min incubation time is enough. Longer times lead to greater debris and lower cell survival. For aged rats, an incubation time of 15–20 min works efficiently. After 10 min, transfer the tube under the laminar hood and slowly pipette up and down 5–7 times with a P1000 pipette. Every 5 min, observe the Falcon tube; if the tissues get soft and the solution milky, stop digestion.After enzyme incubation, monitor the single-cell suspension. If cells are suspended, the solution will appear milky. If further large tissues remain, it is better to remove the upper liquid and continue onto the next steps. To dissociate large particles, add more enzymes to the Falcon tube and incubate for 5 min.To stop enzyme activity, add basic DMEM/F12 medium at three times the volume of the enzymatic solution. Pipette suspension up and down 6–7 times, then centrifuge at 95× g for 5 min.Discard the supernatant, re-suspend the cell pellet in growth medium (1 mL), and gently pipette up and down 3–4 times. Avoid bubble formation and rapid pipetting; it reduces cell yield and produces more debris.",
    "Optional:  It is possible to add more medium up to 10 mL and filter through a 70 µm cell strainer. Place cell strainer on a 50 mL Falcon tube and strain the solution through it; this removes un-dissociated tissue clumps, white matter, and connective tissue. However, it might be at the expense of losing some NSPCs.Cell counting and plating Perform cell counting on obtained single cells.In some culture conditions, the isolation procedure fails, and no single cell is obtained. The bright round cells are not visible, and the culture is full of undigested tissue and dead cells. Therefore, this culture is not appropriate for plating. However, the presence of debris and dead cells is inevitable in primary culture. The experimenter must recognize single cells that are small, bright cells. Cell debris have uneven shapes with one layer observable under the microscope, but live cells have three layers and round shapes. Debris appears as a dot-like spot in the culture. Also, it is possible to use DAPI staining and trypan blue staining to distinguish debris from isolated neural stem cells.Dilute 10 μL of the cell suspension with 10 μL of 0.4% trypan blue in a microtube.Transfer 10 μL from the mixture onto hemocytometer chambers.Count four individual squares (WBC cell count squares).Divide the total number by 4, multiply by 2 (dilution factor) and 104.The area of each square is 1 mm × 1 mm. The space between the coverslip and slide is 0.1 mm. Therefore, the volume of a large square is 1 mm3 or 0.0001 mL. According to the properties of the hemocytometer chamber, to measure cell count per milliliter, the average number of cells is multiplied by the dilution factor and 104.By this calculation, the total number of cells in 1 mL of cell suspension is measured.",
    "Measure and optimize cell densities of your interest in specific cell culture vessels (see Note 2). 2 × 105 cells for a T-25 flask, 1.5 × 105 cells per well for 6-well plates, 1 × 104 per well for 12-well plates. It depends on the number of animals used for each condition. (Maintenance and growth of NSPCs in DMEM/F12 require plating in high density. Complete media prepared by basic DMEM/F12 medium, not neurobasal A.)For aged rats, plate cells as following densities: 2.5 × 105 cells for the T-25 flask, 1.5 × 105 cells per well for 6-well plates, and 1 × 105 cells per well for 12-well plates. Use adherent flasks and well plates. For neurosphere culture use 1.5 × 105 cells per well in non-adherent 6-well plates.Generation of adherent monolayer culture (Figures 5, 6) imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4843/bioprotoc-13-19-4843-g005.jpgFigure 5. Culture of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) isolated from the dentate gyrus of young adult rats as a monolayer at different days in vitro. A. Day 2: neural stem/progenitor cells are visible as bright small round cells; these cells start attaching to the surface by day 3, and by day 5 most of the proliferating cells developed processes with small cell bodies. B. Day 18: represents proliferating NSPCs, which were growing continuously to occupy the culture vessel. C. By day 28, NSPCs display a substantial increase in numbers and were inclined to make connections. D. On day 38, rosette-like structures appeared. All scale bars are 100 μm with a 10× objective lens.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4843/bioprotoc-13-19-4843-g006.jpgFigure 6. Culture of neural progenitor cells from dentate gyrus of adult aged rats as monolayer on different days in vitro. A. Day 12: single cells broaden their processes and grow rapidly. B. Day 19: proliferating neural progenitor cells as spindle-like shape are shown and proliferated to confluent vessel. C.",
    "Day 21: proliferated neural progenitor cells at the 80% confluency are visible. D. Day 51: most of the cells present smaller processes. All scale bars are 100 µm with objective lens 10×.Plate isolated cells onto a PLO/laminin-coated surface of a T-25 flask, which provides an adequate substrate for the maintenance and growth of NSPCs.Allow cells to expand without disturbance. Leave cells in an incubator for up to 4 days for young adult rats and 7 days for aged rats. Monitor the culture 3–4 days after plating for young adult rats and 7 days for aged rats. Once cells adhere to the surface, remove all the medium above cells using a P1000 pipette and empty it into a 15 mL Falcon tube.After the initial days since attached cells start expanding, add growth factors (20 ng/mL) and heparin (2 µg/mL) into the culture every 2 days.After 7 days for young adult rats and 10 days for aged rats, remove 2.5 mL of medium from the T25 flask and add 2.5 mL of fresh medium.Check the confluency.At 90% confluency, tap the flask slowly with the palm of your hand to dissociate these cells for biochemical assays.It takes 10–15 days to reach 80% confluency in the T25 flask for NSPCs obtained from young adult rats. For aged NSPCs, it takes 20–25 days to reach 80% confluency (see Figures 5 and 6).If there are non-adherent cells or floating spheres in the medium, carry out the following steps:Remove medium above cells using a P1000 pipette and empty it into a 15 mL Falcon tube.Slowly pipette up and down 5–6 times with a P1000 pipette to separate the neurospheres and non-adhered cells from debris attached to them.",
    "For some cases, you can centrifuge at 95× g for 5 min and get a pellet and then add 300 μL of accutase for 3 min at room temperature.Centrifuge at 95× g for 5 min at room temperature.Remove the supernatant and add the same volume of complete serum-free medium to the pellet. Pipette up and down 3–4 times, then return them to their wells (see Note 3).Subculture of adherent monolayer cultures When cells reach approximately 80% confluency, they must be subcultured to avoid cell detachment and overgrowth, as well as to maintain cells in a healthy condition.Perform the following steps for subculturing adherent monolayer cultures.Remove old medium completely, then add 2 mL of PBS (1×) into the T25 flask. Slowly rinse the flask by slightly leaning it from side to side. Remove the PBS (1×) after 30 s.Add 1 mL of accutase to the T25 flask; incubate at 37 °C for 2–3 min while observing the T25 flask under the microscope, and check for detachment of cells. If they are not detached, gently tap each side and bottom of the flask to assist in the detachment of cells. Critical:  It is efficient to detach cells mechanically with a minimal volume of an enzyme.Longer incubation time in enzyme solution causes the low attachment of single cells to the surface after subculture. Severe triturating contributes to low cell yield. Accutase is an enzyme solution of proteolytic and collagenolytic enzymes. It can be used as a direct replacement of trypsin.To inactivate enzymatic activity, add three times the volume of the enzyme solution as DMEM/F12 medium into the T25 flask.Pipette up and down several times, then collect the whole medium, which now contains single cells, into a 15 mL Falcon Tube.",
    "Centrifuge at 95× g for 5 min at room temperatureRe-suspend the pellet in 1 mL of complete serum-free medium very gently. Try not to form bubbles. Immerse pipette tips in the solution thoroughly to the bottom of the Falcon tube and touching the wall of the tube, then start pipetting slowly. Seed the 100,000–150,000 cells in a 6-well plate (Table 1).Seed the cells with high density on the coated well plate. At first passage, you can use either 100,000 cells per well of 6-well plates or 50,000 cells per well of 24-well plates. In the next passages, it is better to increase cell density.Table 1.

Culture of neural progenitor cells from dentate gyrus of adult aged rats as neurospheres on different days in vitro. A. Day 25: neurospheres are formed as their spherical shapes take form and their size increases. B. Day 32: neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) proliferated, and diameter of spheres increased sharply. C. Day 36: neurospheres proliferated rapidly as their centers get a dark appearance. D. Day 41: large and dark neurospheres appeared. E. Day 48: neurospheres begin to attach to the surface. All scale bars are 50 μm with a 20× objective lens.Seed the obtained single cell suspension (2.8–3.5 × 105 cells per milliliter) from the digestion of DG tissue for neurosphere culture as follows:Re-suspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of serum-free growth medium, then count the cells and seed them per recommended numbers (5 × 105 cells for aged rats and 3–4 × 105 cells for young adult rats) in a non-adherent T25 flask. Then, incubate at 37 °C with 5% CO2 (see Note 4). Critical:  Seeding the cells at a higher density than recommended leads to cell aggregation.It is necessary not to disturb the cells after plating until 4–5 days for the young adult group and 7 days for the aged group.",
    "Let cells adapt to culture medium for 4–5 days and start formation of spheres. Avoid any disturbances or movement of the flask (see Note 5).After this initial incubation period, re-plate cell culture as follows: collect all the medium inside the T25 flask (which contains cells and small cell clusters starting the formation of neurospheres) into a 15 mL Falcon tube.Add 1–1.5 mL of PBS (1×) to the T25 flask, then pipette the entire surface of the flask, and discard into a 15 mL Falcon tube.Centrifuge at 95× g for 5 min at room temperature.Re-suspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of neurosphere medium and pipette up and down 2–3 times slowly.Transfer to one well of a 6-well plate.Add growth factors and heparin every 3–4 days; growth factors (20 ng/mL) and heparin (2 μg/mL).After 14–16 days, spheres are formed for young adult rats. Neurosphere of aged rats begin to grow from 10 days post-plating onward. After 28–30 days aged spheres are fully formed (see Note 3 as well as Figures 7 and 8). If the medium becomes yellow, add 1 mL of serum-free medium after 3 days from beginning of culture.Quantification of the number of neurospheres The number of neurospheres serves as an index of NSPCs proliferation. At the stage (optimal time) that the neurospheres reached maximum growth without a dark appearance in the center, estimate the number of spheres as follows:Place the cell culture well plate under an inverted microscope, objective lens 20×.Count spheres field-by-field, starting from a corner and going along the well diameter up to the next corner.Adjust the focus to prevent the detection of cell aggregates instead of healthy spheres.Quantify the size of the neurospheres The diameter of neurospheres is used as an index of neurosphere growth.",
    "With a 20× objective lens, take non-overlapped random images from an entire well (8–9 fields), as most of the spheres are included in the field. Use Infinity software to measure diameters of neurospheres. Average of two measured diameters is representative of neurosphere diameter. Then, express different diameters for each image. For example, if there are seven neurospheres in an image, calculate the diameter of each one. Now you have seven neurospheres with different diameters as there are three neurospheres with a diameter of 58 ± 9 micrometers, two neurospheres with a diameter of 89 ± 13 micrometers, and two neurospheres with a diameter of 120 ± 9 micrometers. This provides valuable quantification data to indirectly evaluate the proliferation rate of NSPCs on different days of in-vitro culture.Use Infinity software as following steps:Open Infinity software > select file > open image > adjust > micrometer > select a ruler from tool bar > place in the length of scale bar and right click > open a page > write 1 in the magnification box and write the length of scale bar in the length box > draw a horizontal line and a vertical line, and right click > length is shown (Figures 9, 10, and 11).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4843/bioprotoc-13-19-4843-g009.jpgFigure 9.

    "Remove supernatant and add 300–500 μL of accutase accurately onto the pellet (neurospheres).Incubate at 25 °C for 4–8 min, based on the size and number of neurospheres. Critical:  During enzyme incubation, it is possible to pipette up and down slowly 4–5 times without generating bubbles. Observe under light to see whether neurospheres are dissociated.Add complete serum-free medium two times the volume of the enzyme and mix gently.Centrifuge at 95× g for 5 min.Re-suspend the pellet in 1 mL of neurosphere medium.Count the cells and plate at the same density of 5 × 105 cells/mL. Critical:  The number of neurosphere passages is important to determine cell density. As in our culture system the proliferation rate decreases with increasing passage numbers, it is essential to plate cells at higher density in stages following the first passage.Immunostaining (Figure 12) Seed 1–2 × 104 cells per well into a 96-well plate (see Note 6).Aspirate medium from wells and wash with 100 μL PBS (1×).Aspirate PBS completely and add 100 μL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS (PH 7.4), then incubate for 20 min at room temperature (it is advisable not to use cold PFA).Aspirate PFA and wash each well with 100 μL of PBS (1×) (three times).Incubate for 10 min with 70–100 μL of 0.2% Triton X-100 to make cell membranes permeable.To block non-specific antigens, add 100 μL of blocking solution (blocking solution is composed of 10% normal goat serum, 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween in PBS) (see Recipes) and incubate for 60 min.Aspirate blocking solution.Wash with 100 μL of PBS (1×) (three times).Dilute primary antibodies in blocking solution as follows:To prepare 350 μL of 1:200 Anti-Nestin solution, add 1.75 μL of Nestin antibody to 348 μL of blocking solution. Prepare before use.To prepare 350 μL of 1:100 Sox2 solution, add 3.",
    "5 μL of Sox2 antibody to 346.5 μL of blocking solution. Prepare before use.To prepare 250 μL of 1:250 GFAP solution, add 1 μL of GFAP antibody to 249 μL of blocking solution. Prepare before use.Add 70 μL of primary antibodies to each well, seal the edges of the plate with parafilm to prevent evaporation of antibody solution, and incubate for 3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C, preferentially inside a humid chamber.Aspirate primary antibodies and wash with 100 μL of PBS (1×) (three times) every 5 min.Dilute secondary antibodies with PBS (1×) (1:1,000 for both secondary antibodies). To prepare 2 mL secondary antibody solution, add 2 µL of secondary antibody into 1,998 µL of PBS (1×).Incubate cells with 70 μL of secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature in the dark.Add 100 μL of PBS (1×) into each well and incubate for 5 min, remove PBS, repeat the procedure three times, then cover the entire 96-well plate with aluminum foil to prevent light penetration.Add 70 μL of DAPI solution per well and incubate for 1 min in the dark at room temperature.Remove the DAPI solution and wash each well with 100 μL of PBS (1×) twice.Capture images immediately using an inverted fluorescence microscope.
