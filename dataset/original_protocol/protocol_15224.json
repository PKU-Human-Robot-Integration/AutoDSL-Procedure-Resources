    "1. Prepare the Enzyme Solution and Proliferation Medium (PM)\nMake Collagenase Type I Solution: Weigh out collagenase type I (12 mg/ml) and dissolve in 1 ml PBS and filter using a 0.2 μm syringe filter. Then place it 15 ml tube and keep it at -20 °C until needed.\nMake dispase Solution: Weigh out dispase (16 mg/ml) and dissolve in 1 ml PBS and filter using a 0.2 μm syringe filter. Then place it 15 ml tube and keep it at 4 °C until needed. \nMake enzyme solution: Add 1 ml collagenase type I solutions (12 mg/ml) and 1 ml dispase solutions (16 mg/ml) into the 2 ml sterile PBS containing 100 mg/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin. Total concentration of dispase and Collagenase I in final volume should be 4 mg/ml and 3 mg/ml, receptively. Then, aliquot this volume in to four 15 ml tube, each containing 1 ml enzyme solution. Each tube could be used for one pulp digestion. \nMake washing solution: Add 100 mg/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin into PBS. \nMake basic media: Alpha modification of Eagle's medium (α-MEM) supplemented with 10% FBS & 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin.\nMake the Proliferation Media (PM): Alpha modification of Eagle's medium (α-MEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 μM L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 mg/ml amphotericin B.    \nMake Odontogenic media: Alpha modification of Eagle's medium (α-MEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 μM L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 0.01 μM Dexamethasone, 5 mM β-Glycerol phosphate, 1.8 mM Monopotassium phosphate. \n2. Prepare Human Dental Pulp Tissue for Dental Pulp Stem Cell Isolation",
    "Normal human third molars were collected from adults (21-29 years of age) at the Dental Clinic of the Imam Ali under approved Institutional Review Board (IRB).    \nTeeth were placed into the basic medium (α-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS) and were transferred into laboratory at 4 °C.    \nUnder the sterile condition, working within a biohazard laminar flow hood, set-up was done one 100 mm Petri dishes for each tooth to be processed. Tooth surfaces were cleaned by 70% ethanol. \nWhile working in one of the Petri-dishes, tooth was kept by dental forceps and a scalpel blade was used to clean off debris and periodontal ligament on the roots. \nCemento-enamel junction was slowly cut by using sterilized dental disc to reveal the pulp chamber. It should be considered that cutting process must be performed slowly to reduce overheating of the dental tissue. \nPulp tissue was gently separated from the crown and root. \nPulp tissue was cut into small pieces with the aid of a scalpel blade. \n3. Human Dental Pulp Isolation\nPulp tissues underwent either enzymatic dissociation of pulp tissue or direct cell outgrowth from pulp tissue explants for isolation of hDPSCs.    \nEnzymatic dissociation of pulp tissue:    \n    \nSmall pieces of pulp tissues were transferred into Enzyme solution for 1 hr at 37 °C. Vortex every 30 min to help breaking up tissue.\nAfterwards, large cell aggregates were removed and Single-cell suspensions were obtained by passing cells through a 70-μM cell strainer.\nSingle-cell suspensions were centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for 5 min at room temperature.\nSupernatants were carefully pipetted off and pellet was re-suspended in 1 ml proliferation medium (PM). (Note: FBS in proliferation medium terminate enzymatic dissociation.) \nSingle-cell suspensions of dental pulp was seeded into 25 cm2 culture flask with PM and then incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2.",
    "The culture medium was changed every three days until the cell confluency was achieved. \nDirect cell outgrowth from pulp tissue explants:\nPulp tissue was minced into 1-2-mm fragments, and each piece was placed in 25-cm2 culture flasks with PM and then incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. It should be considered that total volume of the PM for outgrowth of cell must support the attachment of pulp pieces for further cell outgrowth (2-3 ml per flask).        \nMedium was changed after outgrowth was observed. \nThe outgrown cells at confluence were sub-cultured at ratio of 1:4 (passage 1). \n4. Immunophenotyping\n250,000 cells/tube of both types of cells in passage 3 were incubated by PE or FITC-conjugated anti-human antibodies with their isotypes for 30 min at 4  °C in dark place. (Note: the concentration of antibodies was applied according to the manufacture protocol.)    \nAfter the incubation time, 100 μl PBS or FACS dilution solution was added to each tube and centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for 5 min in dark place. \nSupernatants were removed & pellets were re-suspended in 100 μl PBS or FACS dilution in dark place.    \nTargeted surface markers (CD markers) were evaluated by BD FACSCalibur. \n5. Induction of Differentiation of DPSCs into Mineralized Cells & Quantified Alizarin Red S Assay \nDPSCs that were obtained by either enzymatic dissociation of pulp tissue (known as DPSC-ED) or direct cell outgrowth from pulp tissue explants (DPSC-OG)  were sub-cultured for 3 passages.    \nAt Passage 3, cells were seed into a 6 well plate at 5,000 cell/well. \nAt confluence of 60%, odontogenic medium were replaced by conventional PM. Three wells were remained as a negative control by adding growth medium. \nMedium change every 3 days until day 21.",
    "At day 21, Cells were washed with PBS and were fixed by 1 ml/well 10% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. \nThen paraformaldehyde was pipetted off, carefully and cells were washed 3 times (5-10 min for each time) with distilled H2O. (Note: Avoid disturbing the monolayer.)\nAfter washing, 1 ml/well Alizarin red S were added for 20 min at room temperature. \nCells were washed by deionized H2O four times (5 min for each time with gentle rocking) to remove any additional Alizarin red.\n1 ml/well H2O were added to prevent the cells from drying.\nThe plates were assumed to visual inspection and/or image acquisition.\nFor Alizarin Red S quantification assay, H2O were replaced by 1 ml 10% acetic acid to each well of 6-well plate & incubate for 30 min at room temperature with shaking.    \nThen, cell monolayer/well were scrape & both acetic acid & cells were transferred into the separate 1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tubes. (Note: each well should be transfer into a separate tube i.e. three test wells & three control wells for each ED & OG groups.)\nTubes were vortexed vigorously for 30 sec. \nHeat to 85 °C for 10 min. (Note: to avoid evaporation, tubes were sealed with parafilm.)\nAfter heating, tubes were transferred into ice for 5 min. (Note: Tubes should not be opened until become cooled.)\n The slurries were centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 15 min. While centrifuging, Alizarin Red standards were made up.\n Alizarin Red S standard were prepared by first diluting the dilution buffer & used for making 2-fold serial dilutions based on the table. \ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13",
