    "1. Purification of GST-tagged TRP and His-tagged NORPA fragments\nPurify GST-tagged TRP 1261-1275 fragment\n\t\nTransform the pGEX 4T-1 TRP 1261-1275 plasmid10 into Escherichia coli (E. coli) BL21 (DE3) cells using the CaCl2 heat-shock transformation method21. Inoculate a single colony in 10 mL of Luria Bertani (LB) medium and grow overnight at 37 °C. Then, amplify the 10 mL of seeding culture in 1 L of LB medium at 37 °C.\nAfter the optical density (OD600) of the cells reaches 0.5, cool down the cells to 16 °C and add 0.1 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; final concentration) to induce the overexpression of the target protein and incubate at 16 °C for 18 h.\nAfter overexpression, pellet 1 L of cultured cells by centrifugation at 3,993 × g for 20 min and resuspend in 40 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer.\nLoad the resuspended cells in a high-pressure homogenizer pre-cooled at 4 °C. Slowly increase the homogenizer pressure to 800 bar. Open the inlet tap and let the resuspended cells circularly pass through a valve with very narrow slits.\n\t\tNOTE: The cells are homogenized by the high shearing forces caused by a large pressure drop and cavitation.\nLoad 5 mL of glutathione beads to a gravity flow column and wash the beads with 50 mL of PBS buffer for a total of three times.\nCentrifuge the cell lysate from the high-pressure homogenizer at 48,384 x g. Add the supernatant of the centrifuged cell lysate (40 mL) to the equilibrated glutathione beads in the gravity flow column and incubate for 30 min at 4 °C. Resuspend the glutathione beads every 10 min.",
    "After 30 min of incubation, open the column outlet tap to separate the beads and flow-through fraction. Discard the flow-through fraction. Rinse the remaining glutathione beads twice with 50 mL of PBS buffer.\nAdd 15 mL of elution buffer to the glutathione beads and incubate for 30 min. Resuspend the beads every 10 min.\nAfter 30 min of incubation, elute the GST-tagged TRP 1261-1275 fragment in a 50 mL conical tube and load in a size-exclusion column (preparation grade), which is equilibrated using 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT) buffer.\nKeep the elution flow rate of the size-exclusion column to 3 mL/min. Collect the eluted proteins at the rate of 5 mL/tube.\nIdentify the peak of the target protein in the size-exclusion column by analyzing the UV absorption signals at 280 nm and verify by SDS-PAGE gel analysis (electrophoresis parameters: 150 V for the stacking gel; 200 V for the resolving gel). Stain the gel with Coomassie blue R250.\nConcentrate the purified GST-tagged TRP 1261-1275 fragment from the size-exclusion column to 1 mL using a 15 mL ultrafiltration spin column centrifuged at 3,000 x g at 4 °C in a desk-top refrigerated centrifuge.\nDetermine the concentration of concentrated protein using the Beer-Lambert Law. Measure the UV absorption of GST-tagged TRP 1261-1275 fragment at 280 nm using a spectrophotometer.\nObtain the extinction coefficient at 280 nm by importing the protein sequences into the Protparam program (https://web.expasy.org/protparam/). Typically, 1 L culture of GST-tagged TRP 1261-1275 yields 1 mL of 600 μM of protein (6 x 10-7 mol). See Table 1 for materials needed.\nPurification of His-tagged NORPA 863-1095 fragment",

Inoculate a single colony in 10 mL of LB medium and grow overnight at 37 °C. Then, amplify the 10 mL seeding culture in 1 L of LB medium at 37 °C.\nAfter the OD600 of the cells reaches 0.5, cool down the cells to 16 °C and add 0.1 mM IPTG (final concentration) to induce the overexpression of target protein and incubate at 16 °C for 18 h.\nAfter overexpression, pellet 1 L of cultured cells by centrifugation at 3,993 x g for 20 min and resuspend in 40 mL of binding buffer. Next, lyse the resuspended cells in a high-pressure homogenizer at 4 °C as described in step 1.1.4.\nLoad 5 mL of Ni-beads into a gravity flow column and wash three times with 50 mL of binding buffer.\nCentrifuge the cell lysate from the high-pressure homogenizer at 48,384 x g. Add the supernatant of the centrifuged cell lysate to the equilibrated Ni-beads in the gravity flow column and incubate for 30 min at 4 °C. Resuspend the Ni-beads every 10 min.\nAfter 30 min of incubation, open the column outlet tap to separate the beads and flow-through fraction. Discard the flow-through fraction and wash the remaining Ni-beads twice with 50 mL of wash buffer.\nAdd 15 mL of elution buffer to the Ni-beads and incubate for 30 min. Resuspend the Ni-beads every 10 min.\nAfter 30 min of incubation, collect the eluted His-tagged NORPA 863-1095 fragment in a 50 mL conical tube and load into a size-exclusion column (preparation grade), which is equilibrated using 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT).",

Preparation of Drosophila heads\nCollect adult flies in 50 mL conical centrifugation tubes using the CO2 anaesthetization method22,23; immediately freeze in liquid nitrogen for 10 min and store in a -80°C freezer.\nAfter collecting a sufficient number of flies, vigorously shake the frozen 50 mL conical tubes by hand to separate the flies' legs, heads, wings, and bodies. Transfer the mixture to three sequentially stacked pre-cooled stainless-steel sieves (20/30/40 mesh size, respectively) and shake the sieves.\nNext, since the heads cannot pass through the 40-mesh sieve, use a brush to sweep the fly heads off the 40-mesh sieve, transfer them into 50 mL conical tubes, and store them at −80 °C.",
    "Continuously collect the flies and their heads and store them in a -80 °C freezer until they reach the required amount needed for experimentation (0.5 g). Typically, to collect 0.5 g of heads, 35 mL of flies in a 50 mL conical tube are needed. See Table 3 for materials needed.\n3. Drosophila TRP channel purification\nWeigh a total of 0.5 g of heads and completely homogenize in liquid nitrogen using a pre-cooled mortar-pestle. Dissolve the homogenized heads in 10x v/w lysis buffer (5 mL), incubate in a shaker at 4 °C for 20 min, and then centrifuge at 20,817 x g for 20 min at 4 °C.\nCollect the spin-down supernatant (\"20817 g S\", Figure 4) and further centrifuge it at 100,000 x g for 60 min at 4 °C. Use the spin-down supernatant (\"100,000 g S\", Figure 4) for the following pull-down assay.\nAdd 1 mL of Ni-beads into the gravity flow column and wash the beads with 10 mL of double-distilled H2O (ddH2O) at 4 °C for a total of three times. Equilibrate the beads with 10 column volumes of lysis buffer three times at 4 °C.\nAdd 500 µL of 600 µM purified His-tagged NORPA 863-1095 protein (3 x 10-7 mol) into the Ni-column and incubate for 30 min at 4 °C. Resuspend the beads every 10 min.\nOpen the column outlet tap to separate the beads and flow-through fraction. Take the flow-through fraction for SDS-PAGE analysis (NORPA F, Figure 4). In this section, the bait proteins are immobilized on the Ni-beads.",
    "Wash the Ni-beads with 10 column volumes of lysis buffer (10 mL) at 4 °C and keep the washing fraction for SDS-PAGE analysis (Wash 1, Figure 4A). Repeat the above steps and keep the sample for SDS-PAGE analysis (Wash 2, Figure 4A). In this section, the excessive bait proteins on the Ni-beads are removed.\nAdd the supernatant of Drosophila head homogenate after 100,000 x g centrifugation into the Ni-column at 4 °C, where the His-tagged NORPA 863-1095 fragment has been immobilized.\nIncubate the supernatant with the Ni-beads at 4 °C for 30 min. Resuspend the beads every 10 min. Then, open the column outlet tap to separate the beads and flow-through fraction.\nCollect the supernatant for SDS-PAGE analysis (Dro head lysis F, Figure 4A). In this section, the INAD protein complexes (INAD/TRP/ePKC) in the head homogenates are captured by the immobilized NORPA 863-1095 fragments on the Ni-beads.\nWash the Ni-beads with 10 column volumes of lysis buffer (10 mL) at 4 °C and keep the supernatant from gravity precipitation for SDS-PAGE analysis (Wash 3, Figure 4A). Repeat the above steps and collect the supernatant for SDS-PAGE analysis (Wash 4, Figure 4A). In this section, the unbound proteins on the Ni-beads are removed.\nAdd 500 µL of 600 µM of GST-tagged TRP 1261-1275 protein (3 x 10-7 mol) into the Ni-beads and incubate for 20 min at 4 °C. Resuspend the beads every 10 min.\nCollect the eluted fraction from the gravity column (TRP E1, Figure 4B), which contains the endogenous Drosophila TRP channel. Repeat the above stepsand collect the elution fraction (TRP E2, Figure 4B). In this step, by using the GST-tagged TRP 1261-1275 fragments as the competitor, the TRP channels are eluted from the captured INAD protein complexes (INAD/TRP/ePKC) on the Ni-beads.",
    "Wash the Ni-beads with 10 column volumes of binding buffer (10 mL; Table 1) at 4 °C and collect the washing fraction for SDS-PAGE analysis (Wash 5, Figure 4B).\nAdd 500 µL of elution buffer (Table 1) into the Ni-beads and incubate for 20 min at 4 °C. Collect the elution fraction from the gravity flow column (NORPA E1, Figure 4B). Repeat the above steps, and collect the elution fraction (NORPA E2, Figure 4B).\nUsing the elution buffer, elute the His-tagged NORPA 863-1095 fragment accompanied with the INAD/ePKC protein complexes. Next, resuspend the Ni-beads in 500 µL of binding buffer.\nTake the resuspended Ni-beads to run the SDS-PAGE (stained by Coomassie blue R250) to analyze the efficiency of the elution and evaluate whether the elute buffer works (beads, Figure 4B). See Table 4 for materials needed.\n4. Size-exclusion column purification of Drosophila TRP channel\nInstall a size-exclusion column (analytical grade) on the protein purification system. Equilibrate the column with the column buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 0.75 mM DDM), which is filtered by a 0.45 µm filter.\nConcentrate the TRP E1 and E2 fraction from step 3.14 using a 4 mL ultrafiltration spin column, centrifuged at 3,000 x g at 4 °C in a refrigerated centrifuge.\nRinse the sample loop with the column buffer and load the sample into the sample loop. Inject the sample into the size-exclusion column and elute the proteins with a proper flow rate (0.5 mL/min).\nIdentify the peak of the target protein by absorption at 280 nm and run an SDS-PAGE gel to detect the purified endogenous Drosophila TRP channel (Figure 5).
