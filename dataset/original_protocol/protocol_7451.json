    "DRG culture in 384-wells Below is an optimized protocol for DRG culture used to coat one 384-well plate; work should be performed under sterile conditions in a tissue culture cabinet.Coat a poly-D-lysine-coated 384-well plate additionally with 40 μL of laminin (10 μg/mL in PBS) for 3 h at 37 °C.Isolate DRGs from eight Gch1-GFP reporter mice and collect evenly into two (for balancing purposes during centrifugation) 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes filled with 1.4 mL of neurobasal media.When all DRGs are collected, allow them to settle by gravity and remove as much neurobasal media as possible by pipetting with a 1,000 μL tip.Add 350 μL of liberase-TH solution to the DRGs and incubate at 37 °C for 80 min.Remove liberase-TH solution by pipetting and wash DRGs slowly in 1 mL of PBS, again allowing the DRGs to settle by gravity.Remove PBS by pipetting.Dilute 250 μL of 0.5% trypsin 1:1 in PBS. Add 350 μL of the resulting 0.25% trypsin solution to the tubes and incubate them at 37 °C for 7 min.Add 1 mL of complete media (see Recipes) to stop trypsin reaction.Allow DRGs to settle by gravity and remove supernatant by pipetting carefully.Wash with 1 mL of complete media.Allow DRGs to settle by gravity and remove supernatant by pipetting carefully.Add 1 mL of complete media with DNase-I (10 μg/mL).Flame-polish the tip of three Pasteur pipettes over a Bunsen burner flame, to achieve varying diameters of pipette opening: large, medium, and small (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4666/bioprotoc-13-09-4666-g001.jpgFigure 1. Flame-polished (using a Bunsen burner) pipettes with three comparative sizes of pipette opening Mechanically triturate the DRGs, progressing from the normal diameter pipette to the medium and finally to the small, to dissociate the DRGs into single-cell suspension (with each pipette size, triturate 10–15 times).",
    "Prepare 10% BSA solution in a 50 mL tube by mixing 2 mL of 30% BSA solution with 4 mL of PBS.Layer 1 mL of dissociated DRG suspension over the 10% BSA solution.Wash tube with 500 μL of complete media and transfer and overlay to the 10% BSA tube.Centrifuge at 800× g for 15 min at 4 °C.Carefully remove BSA interface first and then the rest of BSA supernatant (top layer). Then, carefully remove all the BSA lower layer ensuring not to disrupt the cell pellet.Carefully resuspend the DRG pellet first in 2 mL of complete media and bring up to 20 mL. At this point, combine DRG pellets in a total of 20 mL.Pass the cell suspension through a 100 μm cell strainer into a fresh 50 mL conical tube.Centrifuge at 800× g for 15 min at 4 °C.Carefully remove supernatant.Resuspend cell pellet in 2 mL of DRG media (see Recipes).Count DRG neurons using trypan blue staining (in a 1:1 ratio, i.e., 10 μL each) and add 10 μL of resulting mixture to a hemocytometer.Adjust volume to ensure density of 25,000 neurons/mL.Remove laminin solution from the wells completely.Add 40 μL (~1,000 neurons) of the DRGs in DRG media to each well.Incubate plate at 37 °C with 5% CO2 (timepoint set as Day 0).Compound and propidium iodide (PI) addition Twenty-four hours after plating the neurons (i.e., on Day 1), add compounds from chemical library. Compounds should be prepared in such a way that 10 μL of each compound is added to the 40 μL of DRGs to give a desired final working concentration. Add compounds at a rate of approximately 1 mL/min to minimize cell disturbances.Shake plate for 5 min on a shaker at 120 rpm.Incubate plate at 37 °C with 5% CO2.",
    "On Day 3, prepare a working solution of PI viability stain (0.5 μg/mL) to identify dead cells.Add 50 μL of PI solution to the DRGs (i.e., 1:1 mixture).Shake plate for 1 min on a shaker at 120 rpm and incubate plate at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 20 min.Neuronal imaging After PI staining, transfer the plate immediately to PerkinElmer/Evotec Opera QEHS model 2.0 laser spinning-disk confocal fluorescence microscope.Visualize and image Gch1-GFP cells with a 488 nM laser and PI with a 561 nM laser. Divide each well into 15 sections and acquire each section (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4666/bioprotoc-13-09-4666-g002.jpgFigure 2. Confocal imaging of individual Gch1-GFP-expressing dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. A. Each 384-well was divided into 15 regions; confocal fluorescent images of GFP and propidium iodide (PI) were taken of each section. All 15 sections were combined, and the various parameters extracted for each well. B.

Scale bar, 30 µm.Proceed to image analysis."
