    "NOTE: For buffer compositions see Table 1.\n1. Cell culture preparation\nNOTE: Described here is the culture preparation of MIO-M1 cells, a spontaneously immortalized human Müller glial cell line (Moorfield's/Institute of Ophthalmology- Müller 1). Always use proper aseptic technique and work in a laminar flow hood.\nPrepare Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) complete medium. To DMEM containing 4.5 g/L D-glucose and 110 mg/L sodium pyruvate, add 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 2 mM L-glutamine, and 50 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin. Prepare the fresh medium, on the day the MIO-M1 cells will be thawed.\nThaw the frozen MIO-M1 cells on day 1.\n\t\nTo do this, remove the cryovial containing 5 x 105 MIO-M1 cells in FBS with 10% DMSO from liquid nitrogen storage and immediately place it into a 37 °C water bath.\n\t\tNOTE: Always wear a face mask or safety goggles, since cryovials stored in liquid nitrogen present a risk of explosion when thawed.\nThaw the MIO-M1 cells rapidly (in less than 1 min) by warming the vial in the 37 °C water bath until there is just a small bit of ice left in the vial.\nWipe the outside of the vial with 70% ethanol and transfer it to a laminar flow hood.\nTransfer the thawed cells from the vial to a sterile 15 mL tube and then add 6 mL of pre-warmed complete DMEM medium dropwise.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at approximately 600 x g for 5 min. After the centrifugation, a clear supernatant and a complete pellet will be visualized. Discard the supernatant with a pipette without disturbing the cell pellet.",
    "Gently dissociate the pellet and resuspend the cells in 10 mL of complete DMEM medium. Transfer this cell suspension into a 100 mm diameter tissue culture plate and incubate the plate for approximately 2 days at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nWhen the MIO-M1 cells become 80%-90% confluent on day 4, perform the following steps.\n\t\nTransfer the plate into a laminar flow hood from the incubator. Carefully remove the supernatant and wash 2x with 5 mL of sterile and pre-warmed PBS. Aspirate the PBS.\nDispense 1 mL of 0.5% Trypsin-EDTA solution and incubate at 37 °C in the CO2 incubator for 3-5 min to detach the cells.\nAdd 7 mL of the complete DMEM medium to inhibit the trypsin action. Disaggregate clustered trypsinized MGCs by slowly pipetting up and down (P1000). Collect the cell suspension in a 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 600 x g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant. Gently resuspend the cell pellet in 2 mL of complete DMEM media. Transfer 1 mL of this cell suspension into a 100 mm plate containing 9 mL of pre-warmed complete DMEM medium.\nRepeat the action with another 100 mm plate. Incubate the plate for approximately 1 day at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nWhen both plates become 80%-90% confluent (on day 6), transfer the plate into a laminar flow hood. Follow step 1.3. to obtain a cell pellet.\nGently dissociate the pellet and resuspend the cells in 5 mL of complete DMEM media. Count the MIO-M1 cells using a hemocytometer (Neubauer chamber) and trypan blue solution by following the steps below.\n\t\nPut the glass cover on the Neubauer chamber central area. Place the chamber on a flat surface (e.g., a table or workbench).",
    "Mix an equal volume of trypan blue stain with the cells. For instance, mix 60 µL of trypan blue with 60 µL of cells for a 1:2 dilution.\nFrom this mixture, load 10 µL with a micropipette into a Neubauer chamber.\nPlace the loaded Neubauer chamber on the microscope stage. Then, turn on the light and adjust the brightness.\nMove the microscope stage to an optimal position and adjust the focus until a sharp image of the cells is obtained.\nCount the cells inside the four squares (subdivided in 16) located at the corner of the hemocytometer (volume: 0.1 mm3 each ).\nCalculate the cell concentration using the equations below.\n\t\tConcentration = (Number of cells x 10.000)/Number of squares\n\t\tConcentration = (Number of cells x 10.000)/4\n\t\tConcentration = Number of cells x 2500\n\t\tNOTE: If cell dilution is performed, the concentration obtained should be converted to the original concentration before the dilution.\n\t\t​Concentration = (Number of cells x 2500 x 2) = (Number of cells x 5000 cells/mL)\nAdjust the cell suspension to 1 x 105 cells/mL in complete DMEM medium and plate 2 mL of this cell suspension into a 6-well plate (2 x 105 cells/well). Shake the plate gently to distribute the cells homogeneously. Incubate the 6-well plate overnight at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\n2. Assay conditions and controls\nInclude the following experimental controls for each experiment:\n\t\nAutofluorescence control (cells without DCFH-DA probe, control for setting the flow cytometer parameters).\nBasal control (unstimulated cells).\nPositive control (cells treated with a ROS inducer, A or B).\nNegative control (cells treated with antioxidant compound)\nSample (cells treated with antioxidant compound and ROS inducer, A or B).\n3. Performing the assay",
    "NOTE: The assay is performed on day 7. Always use proper aseptic technique and work in a laminar flow hood unless otherwise instructed.\nPrepare low serum DMEM. Supplement DMEM containing 4.5 g/L D-glucose and 110 mg/L sodium pyruvate with 0.5% heat-inactivated FBS,10 mM HEPES, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 50 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin. Prepare the fresh medium on the day the MIO-M1 will be treated.\nTransfer the 6-well plate (60%-70 % confluence) to a laminar flow hood from the incubator. Aspirate the supernatant and wash the cells 1x with PBS. Add 2 mL of the low serum DMEM per well and incubate the 6-well plate for 2 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. This is done to starve the cells.\nAfter serum starving, treat the cells with the antioxidant compound for 6 h.\n\t\nAspirate the supernatant and add 2 mL of the diluted stock to the following conditions: negative control (cells treated with antioxidant compound) and sample (cells treated with antioxidant compound and ROS inducer, A or B).\nIncubate the 6-well plate for 6 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\n\t\tNOTE: If using another antioxidant compound or ROS inhibitor, standardize the optimum time and concentration for the stimuli.\nAfter 6 h of incubation, treat the cells with ROS inducer, A or B, for 30 min.\n\t\nAdd the stimuli to the following conditions: positive control (cells treated with a ROS inducer, A or B) and sample wells (cells treated with antioxidant compound and ROS inducer, A or B).\n\t\tNOTE: Keep the stock solutions on ice.\nIncubate the 6-well plate for 30 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\n\t\tNOTE: If using another ROS inducer, properly standardize the optimum time and concentration for the stimuli.\nLoad the cells with the DCFH-DA probe.",
    "Aspirate the supernatant and wash the cells in the 6-well plate 3x with PBS to remove all the stimuli.\nTurn off the light of the laminar flow hood and work in the dark. Prepare a dilution of 1:1000 of the 5 mM DCFH-DA probe stock solution to obtain a final concentration of 5 µM DCFH-DA in DMEM without phenol red in a 15 mL tube.\nMix gently using a vortex and add 1 mL of this solution to the following wells: basal control (unstimulated cells), positive control (cells treated with a ROS inducer), negative control (cells treated with antioxidant compound), and sample wells (cells treated with antioxidant compound, and ROS inducer, A or B).\nAdd 1 mL of DMEM without phenol red to the autofluorescence control cells.\nIncubate the 6-well plate for 30 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\n\t\t​NOTE: The probe is light sensitive. Discard all the unused probe solution.\n4. Cell preparation for flow cytometry\nAfter 6 h, keep the plate on ice. From this step onward, it is not necessary to use proper aseptic technique and work in a laminar flow hood.\nWash the cells 3x with 2 mL of cold PBS per well. Add 0.5 mL of cold detaching buffer to each well. Harvest the cells by gently pipetting up and down using a P1000 pipette.\nCollect them in labeled 1.5 mL tubes and centrifuge at 600 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: When harvesting the cells, avoid bubble formation by setting the P1000 pipette to 0.4 mL. From this step onward, work fast.\nWhen centrifugation ends, put labeled 1.5 mL tubes with the cells on ice. Discard the supernatant carefully and gently dissociate the cell pellet with tapping.",
    "Add 1 mL of FACS buffer to each labeled 1.5 mL tube to wash the cells. If necessary, use a vortex at its lowest intensity for the complete dissociation of the cell pellet. Centrifuge them at 600 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Repeat these steps 2x more. (Perform three washes in total).\nWhen the last wash ends, label 5 mL round-bottom polystyrene tubes (flow cytometry tubes) for all experimental conditions (see step 2.).\nWhen centrifugation ends, resuspend the cell pellets in 200 µL of FACS buffer. Gently dissociate the pellet in each 1.5 mL tube by using a vortex. Transfer to labeled 5 mL round-bottom tubes. Keep the tubes on ice until they are analyzed on the flow cytometer.\n5. Data acquisition in a flow cytometer\nUsing the flow cytometry software, create a new experiment. To do this, in the Menu bar go to Experiment and click New Experiment (Ctrl+E).\nAlso, in the Menu bar, go to View and click the following options: Toolbar, Status bar, Browser, Cytometer, Inspector, Worksheet, Acquisition Dashboard and Biexponential Editor to see these windows in the workspace.\nOn the left of the software, click the Specimen_001 . This will open a list of tubes (Tube_001, Tube_002, etc.). To label the tubes for the controls and different experimental conditions, double-click Tube_001, Tube_002, etc. and rename them (see step 2.).\nSelect the channels/parameters to be analyzed (FSC, SSC, FITC, and APC or any other fluorochrome to see the quadrant) in the first tube from Cytometer settings of the experiment.\nClick the Current Tube Pointer icon to select the tube, and the icon will change to green. Place the \"autofluorescence control\" tube on the aspirator arm, moving the base carefully only to the left.",
    "To run the \"autofluorescence control\" sample, go to the Acquisition Dashboard window and click Acquire Data. Open a dot plot for FSC (on the x-axis) versus SSC (on the y-axis).\nAdjust forward and side scatter voltage quickly in order to ensure that the events appear on the graph. In the Acquisition Dashboard window click Stop Acquiring. In this experiment, the following voltage settings were used: FSC - 200 V, SSC - 423 V.\nTo set the FITC voltage, run the \"positive control (cells treated with a ROS inducer, A or B)\". Adjust the voltage so that all the events appear on a histogram of FITC. In this case, use a voltage of 280 V. In the Acquisition Dashboard window, click Stop Acquiring.\nPlace again the \"autofluorescence control\" tube on the aspirator arm. In the Acquisition Dashboard window, click Acquire Data, then Record Data, and select the desired stop conditions (for example, 50,000 events). Draw a gate around the cells of interest, excluding dead cells and debris.\n\tNOTE: These are observed as much smaller events than the main cell population and appear on the lower left of the plot.\nWhen the acquisition ends, remove the tube from the aspirator arm. The equipment will wash itself. In the Acquisition Dashboard window, click Next Tube and run the Basal control (unstimulated cells). Click Acquire Data and then Record Data.\n\t\nFrom the initial gate (gate that excludes the dead cells and debris), create another dot plot of FITC (on the x-axis) versus APC (on the y-axis). Draw a quadrant gate and adjust the coordinates in order to visualize the events on the lower left quadrant of the FITC versus APC plot.\nFor recording the next samples, remove the tube and click Next tube > Acquire Data > Record Data.",
    "NOTE: The flow cytometer used here (see Table of Materials) records a maximum of 1 x 106 events per tube.\nWhen the recording of all tubes ends, export the data to disk D. To do this click File > Export > FCS files > Select 3.0 or 3.1 version.\n\tNOTE: Although data acquisition using one software (see Table of Materials) is described in detail in this protocol, any other flow cytometry software can be used. The acquisition parameters (FSC, SSC, and FITC) can be set in the same way to obtain the results.\n6. Analysis of the acquired data\nOpen the software and add the samples using the Add Samples action button; it is located on the taskbar or in the Navigate band.\n\t\nClick Add Samples.\nUsing the file browser, navigate to the Experimental folder.\nSelect the Experimental folder and click Choose.\n\t\tNOTE: The sample files load as part of the \"All Samples\" group into the workspace.\nDouble-click the first sample in the workspace: Autofluorescence Control.\n\tNOTE: This action opens a Graph window plotting events along forward scatter (FSC-A on the x-axis) versus side scatter (SSC-A on the y-axis) parameters.\nDraw a polygon gate to isolate the cells of interest, excluding dead cells and debris.\n\t\nClick the Polygon Gate tool.\nClick within the plot to make up the polygon gate. Make as many sides as needed.\nDouble-click at the last point to close the polygon and create the gate desired.\nProvide a name for the gate, such as \"MIO-M1 cells\", and press OK.\n\t\t​NOTE: A new graph plot window appears displaying only the MIO-M1 events without dead cells and debris.\nRepeat with all the samples to analyze.",
    "Change the plot to a histogram. To do so, click the X axis parameter label and select FITC-A. Click the Y axis parameter label and select Histogram. This changes the plot to a one-dimensional histogram.\nAdd Statistics using the Add Statistic Window.\n\t\nBelow of histogram graph, click Add Statistics. The program will open a new statistic window.\nOn the left of the new window select the statistics Geometric Mean.\nSelect the Population MIO-M 1 cells.\nFrom the list of available parameters, select FIT-C.\nClick the Add button to apply them to the analysis.\n\t\tNOTE: This creates the new statistics \"geometric mean: FITC\" in the sample gating tree, and their values are displayed in your workspace.\nPut these geometric mean values in a statistics program and analyze.\nClick the L icon to open the Layout Editor; this icon is in Menu tab on the workspace. Position the Workspace window and Layout Editor side-by-side.\n\tNOTE: The Layout Editor is a separated workspace window with tools for displaying multiple graph plots and statistics in a simple graphical report.
