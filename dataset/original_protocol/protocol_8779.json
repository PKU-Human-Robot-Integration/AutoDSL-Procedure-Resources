    "1. Chemicals and Purified Enzymes\nProcure the following materials: PDHC and KGDHC of porcine heart origin (or another purified mitochondrial flavoenzyme); H2O2 (30% solution), pyruvate, α-ketoglutarate, NAD+, NADH, CoASH, thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), mannitol, HEPES, sucrose, EGTA, 3-methyl-2-oxo valeric acid (KMV), superoxide dismutase (SOD), horseradish peroxidase (HRP), 10-Acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine reagent (AUR), and CPI-613.\n2. Planning the Assay and Reagent Preparation\nSet up the assay according to Table 1 in a 96-well plate.\n\tNOTE: The total volume for each reaction is 200 µL. Stock concentrations are adjusted such that 20 µL of reagent is added to each well. This ensures rapid addition of cofactors and substrates to each reaction well prior to starting the assay.\nPrepare reaction buffer containing 220 mM mannitol, 70 mM sucrose, 1 mM EGTA, and 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4 with HCl).\n\tNOTE: This could change depending on the physical properties of different purified enzymes.\nExamine the purified KGDHC or PDHC for contamination using enzyme activity assays14,16,17 or by immunoblot or Coomassie stain5.\nPrepare all reagents in the reaction buffer as per the working solution concentrations in Table 1.\nStore all reagents as 1 mL aliquots at -20 °C. Store pyruvate and α-ketoglutarate at -80 °C in 100-µL aliquots to prevent spontaneous degradation due to auto-oxidation and repeated freeze-thaw.\nPrepare the AUR reagent master stock in 1 mL of DMSO and then dilute to 100 µM in reaction buffer. Store protected from light.\n\tNOTE: Here, the 100 µM working solution is made fresh every 2 to 3 weeks and protected from light.\n3. Setting Up the Assay Template\nSet up the assay procedure on a monochromatic microplate reader with dual measurement capabilities.\nDefine the reading procedure by selecting \"PROTOCOL\". Then click \"PROCEDURE\".\nSet \"TEMPERATURE\" to 25 °C (Figure 1A).",
    "Click \"START KINETIC\" to set read conditions (Figure 1A). Set the time and number of read intervals/experiments.\nClick \"READ\" (Figure 1B).\n\tNOTE: Samples are read from TOP position with a gain of 50. Time: 5 min, read at 30-s intervals. Channel 1: Resorufin fluorescence - excitation/emission = 565 nm:600 nm, wavelength width of 13.5 nm. Channel 2: NADH autofluorescence - excitation/emission = 376 nm:450 nm, wavelength width of 20 nm.\nUnder \"READ\", select wells to monitor (e.g., A1-A4 and B1-B4).\nSelect \"END KINETIC\".\n4. Standard Curves\nThaw the reagents and store on ice until needed.\nNADH standard curve (Figure 2A)\nPrepare the working solutions for NADH in the concentration range of 0.5-10 mM in reaction buffer.\nAdd 20 µL aliquots from each NADH working solution concentration to wells containing 180 µL reaction buffer. The final concentration of NADH in each well is 0.05-1 mM.\nClick \"READ\" and set excitation/emission = 376 nm:450 nm, wavelength width of 20 nm.\n\t\tNOTE: This is an endpoint read only - kinetic parameters are not required.\nAUR standard curve (Figure 2B)\nPrepare the working stocks of hydrogen peroxide in reaction buffer; stock concentrations range from 200-4,000 nM.\nAdd 120 µL of the reaction buffer to each well.\nAdd 20 µL of HRP (working stock concentration = 30 U/mL, final concentration in the well = 3 U/mL), 20 µL of SOD (working stock concentration = 250 U/mL, final concentration in the well = 25 U/mL), and 20 µL of AUR (working stock concentration = 100 µM, final concentration in the well = 10 µM) to each well containing reaction buffer.\nAdd 20 µL of each H2O2 working stock solution to each well containing buffer and assay reagents. The final reaction volume is 200 µL and the final concentration of H2O2 in each well is 20-400 nM.",
    "Incubate the plates for 1 min in the plate reader at 25 °C.\nClick \"READ\" and set excitation/emission = 565 nm/600 nm, wavelength width of 13.5 nm. Note that this is an endpoint read only - kinetic parameters are not required.\n5. Measuring O2 ●- /H2 O2 Release and NADH Production by KGDHC and PDHC\nSee Table 1 for the order of addition of the different reagents, the concentration of each working solution, and the volume added to each well.\nAdd 40 µL of reaction buffer to each well. For assays using KMV or CPI-613, add 20 µL of buffer to each well.\nAdd 20 µL of PDHC or KGDHC (working stock of 1 U/mL, final concentration per well = 0.1 U/mL) to each well.\nIncubate PDHC and KGDHC at 25 °C for 2 min.\nAdd 20 µL of KMV (working stock = 100 mM, final concentration = 10 mM) or 20 µL of CPI-613 (working stock concentration = 1.5 mM, final concentration = 150 µM) (Table 2).\n\tNOTE: This step can be excluded if inhibitors are not being used for the assays.\nIncubate for 1 min at 25 °C.\n\tNOTE: This step can be excluded if inhibitors are not being used for the assays.\nAdd 20 µL of HRP (working stock concentration = 30 units/mL, final concentration in the well = 3 units/mL) and 20 µL of SOD (working stock concentration = 250 units/mL, final concentration in the well = 25 units/mL) to each well.\nAdd 20 µL of coenzyme A (working stock concentration = 1 mM, final concentration = 0.1 mM), 20 µL of TPP (working stock concentration = 3 mM, final concentration = 0.3 mM), and 20 µL of NAD+ (working stock concentration = 10 mM, final concentration = 1 mM) to each well.",
    "Remove the AUR reagent from protective tinfoil covering and add 20 µL to each well.\nAdd 20 µL of pyruvate (working stock concentration ranging from 1-100 mM, final concentration for assays = 0.1-10 mM) to wells containing PDHC and α-ketoglutarate (working stock concentration ranging from 1-100 mM, final concentration for assays = 0.1-10 mM) to wells containing KGDHC.\nClick \"READ\" to start kinetic measurement.\n6. Data Analysis\nHold down the 'CTRL' button on the keyboard and click wells to generate one graph containing all kinetic measurements corresponding to channel 1 (Figure 3A).\nClick \"data\" in the view icon in the upper right corner for raw values for relative fluorescence units (RFU) measured at the different time points (Figure 3B).\nExport the values for analysis (Table 3).\nClick the \"Graph\" drop down menu on top right (Figure 3B) to access RFU values associated with the fluorescence channel 2.\nRepeat steps 6.1 to 6.3 for channel 2.\nSubscription Required.
