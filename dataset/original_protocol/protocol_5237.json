    "Harvesting of mature pollen grainsGrow plants (e.g., tomato cv. Moneymaker–MM hereafter and cv. Red setter–RS hereafter) under controlled greenhouse conditions (for tomato: 24 °C/20 °C, day/night; 60% humidity (Fragkostefanakis et al., 2015).Note: Growth conditions need to be adapted for the plant species or cultivar in use.Harvest anthers (> 10 mm length for MM and RS) from flower buds after anthesis as they contain mature pollen grains (preferable time is 0-72 h post anthesis).Make a horizontal cut on the collected anther and put four anthers in one 1.7 ml microtube containing 500 µl of germination solution.Squeeze anther tissue with slight mechanical stress using pipette tips and vortex for 15-20 sec to release the mature pollen from anther locules.Further, pass germination solution containing isolated mature pollen grains through cheesecloth to remove anther debris.Centrifuge the collected pollen grains at 10,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.Remove the supernatant, wash the pelleted pollen grains with 200 µl of germination solution and centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 1 min at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant and repeat the washing step A7. Remove the supernatant, immerse the collected pollen in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C till further usage.Isolation of membrane-enriched fractionAdd metal beads (Daisy BB) that help to homogenize the tissue to microtubes and grind the collected mature pollen grains with TissueLyser II (at 25/sec for 1 min).Add 10-20 ml homogenisation buffer containing sodium chloride (NaCl, 750 mM) and protease inhibitor cocktail to the ground mature pollen, re-suspend and leave it on ice for 30 min.Centrifuge the homogenised mixture at 100,000 x g for 60 min at 4 °C.Re-suspend the pellet in Laemmli buffer and quantify the protein concentration. Note: The supernatant is enriched in soluble proteins and can also be subjected to shotgun proteomics protocol, if needed.",
    "Shotgun proteomicsLoad 40 µg of total proteins onto an SDS-PAGE (12.5% with maximum thickness 1 mm) and run the gel at 80 V constant for 1.5 cm in resolving gel (Valledor and Weckwerth, 2014). Laemmli buffer is used as loading buffer.Stain the gel with methanol:acetic acid:water:Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (40:10:50:0.001) for 30 min and de-stain it overnight in methanol:water (40:60). Afterwards, slice the thick stacked protein band from the remaining gel and chop it into smaller pieces with a sharp blade. Immerse the chopped gel pieces into double distilled water until all samples are processed.Afterwards, remove water and add 1 ml of sodium bicarbonate (25 mM) and incubate at 37 °C for 15 min. Discard supernatant and add 1 ml of 25 mM sodium bicarbonate and 50% acetonitrile. Incubate the samples at 37 °C for 15 min. Repeat this step.Remove the supernatant and dehydrate gel pieces in 300 μl 100% acetonitrile for 5 min at room temperature. Discard supernatant and dry out in a Speed-Vac for 5 min.Note: Gel pieces should have a ‘transparent-plastic’ look. If the gel-pieces are still translucent, repeat the step.Digest the chopped gel pieces with 50 µl trypsin solution (10 ng/μl) and incubate for 15 min at 37 °C. If required, add more trypsin solution until the gel pieces are completely rehydrated. Incubate for 14-16 h at 37 °C and avoid shaking during incubation. Afterwards, stop the reaction by adding 5 μl of 1.0% trifluoroacetic acid (pH should be < 4 after addition of TFA). Note: Add 1 ml of trypsin buffer to dilute trypsin to 10 ng/μl. Incubate on ice for 10 min and then pipette up and down to completely re-suspend the pellet. After dilution, trypsin can be stored at -20 °C for one month.",
    "It is highly recommended to store it in aliquots (Valledor and Weckwerth, 2014).For peptide extraction, add 150 µl of 50% acetonitrile (v/v) and 1% formic acid (v/v) into the microtube containing the gel pieces and incubate for 5 min at room temperature followed by sonication for 3 min (low intensity ultrasound bath). Spin microtubes (1,000 x g for 1 min) and collect the supernatant in a new microtube ‘A’. Repeat step C6 and transfer the supernatant to microtube ‘A’.Add 100 µl of 90% acetonitrile (v/v) and 1% formic acid (v/v) to the microtube containing the gel pieces and incubate for 5 min at room temperature. Transfer the supernatant to microtube ‘A’.Dry the samples in Speed-Vac (microtube A). For long-term storage of extracted peptides -80 °C is preferred.Afterwards, proceed with peptide desalting using spec 96 well C18, Agilent (Valledor and Weckwerth, 2014).Dissolve peptides in 4% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. Inject digested peptides into a one-dimensional nanoflow LC-MS/MS system that has a precolumn. Elute the peptides with an Ascentis column during 80 min and a gradient ranging from 5% to 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid and perform mass spectral analysis on an Orbitrap LTQ XL mass spectrometer with a controlled flow rate of 500 nl per minute and specific tune settings for MS as follows: spray voltage set to 1.8 kV; temperature of the heated transfer capillary set to 180 °C. After each full MS scan, perform ten MS/MS scans, and dynamically select ten most abundant peptide molecular ions, with a dynamic exclusion window set to 90 sec. Omit ions with a +1 or unidentified charge state in the full MS from MS/MS analysis."
