    "NOTE: The detailed stepwise protocol of the assay is described below, and the schematic protocol is shown in Figure 1.\n1. C. albicans strains and growth conditions\nGrow the C. albicans strains in liquid Yeast Extract-Peptone-Dextrose (YPD) medium at 30 °C in an incubator shaker overnight.\n\tNOTE: Maintain Candida strains as frozen stocks and grow on YPD agar (1 % yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose, and 2% agar).\n2. Preparation of reagents\nPrepare the assay medium as follows:\n\t\nFor mitochondrial function assay, dissolve 1.04 g Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 powder and 2 g glucose (2%) in 90 mL sterile water and warm the media to 37 °C. Adjust the pH to 7.4 using 5 M NaOH and make up the volume to 100 mL with sterile water.\nFor glycolytic stress assay, dissolve 1.04 g RPMI 1640 powder alone in 90 mL sterile water, warm the media to 37 °C and adjust the pH to 7.4. Make up the volume to 100 mL with sterile water. RPMI 1640 powder has no bicarbonate, which is critical to monitor the pH change as a measure of glycolysis during the assay.\nInjection compounds.\n\t\nPrepare 1 M glucose stock in sterile water and store at -20 °C.\nPrepare 100 mM oligomycin stock in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), aliquot in small volumes and store at -20 °C.\nPrepare 100 mM antimycin A stock in DMSO, aliquot in small volumes and store at -20 °C.\nPrepare 100 mM SHAM (salicylhydroxamic acid) stock in ethanol on the day of assay.\nPrepare 1 M KCN in the sterile water on the day of the assay.\n3. Coating of the assay plate with Poly-D-Lysine (PDL)\nNOTE: Perform all the below steps in a laminar hood.",
    "Dissolve Poly-D Lysine in tissue culture grade water to make 50 µg/mL final concentration. Mix it well and aliquot into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and store at -20 °C for the long term.\n\tNOTE: 50 µL per well is needed, and for 24 wells, 1.2 mL is required. Therefore, aliquot at least 1.3 mL per microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 50 µL per well and incubate at room temperature with the lid covered for 1-2 h.\nAspirate the solution and rinse one time with 500 µL sterile tissue culture grade water.\nOpen the lid and allow the wells to air dry. Use the plate on the same day or store at 4 °C for a maximum of 2-3 days.\n4. Hydration of sensor cartridge\nNOTE: Perform this step one day before the experiment.\nOpen the extra flux Assay Kit and remove the contents. Place the sensor cartridge upside down next to the utility plate (Figure 2).\nFill each well of the utility plate with 1 mL of calibrant and place the sensor cartridge back. Make sure the sensors which contain fluorophores (to measure the oxygen and pH) are submerged in the calibrant.\nIncubate the sensor cartridge overnight in a non-CO2 incubator at 37 °C.\n5. Growing and seeding cells in the PDL-coated plates\nInoculate C. albicans in the YPD broth and grow overnight at 30 °C in a shaker at 200 rpm.\n\tNOTE: Based on the assay design and the interest, C. albicans can also be grown in YPG or minimal medium.\nOn the day of assay, dilute an appropriate number of cells in the assay medium to yield a final concentration of 100,000 cells per 100 µL.",
    "Add 100 µL of the diluted cells into each well of the assay plate except wells A1, B4, C3, and D6, in which add only 100 µL of the assay medium for background correction (Figure 3).\nTransfer the plate to a non-CO2 incubator at 37 °C and incubate for 60 min, which will let the cells adhere to the plate surface.\n6. Assay Protocol\nNOTE: The protocol outlined here is for the 24-well format of the instrument. Volumes will need to be adjusted if another format is used.\nMitochondrial function assay\n\t\nPreparation of compounds\n\t\t\nPrepare compounds at 10x concentration for mitochondrial function assay: Prepare 20 mM SHAM, 100 µM Oligomycin, 100 mM KCN, and 20 µM Antimycin A in the corresponding assay medium.\nAdd 50 µL SHAM into the port A, 55 µL Oligomycin into port B, 62 µL KCN into port C and 68 µL Antimycin A into port D (Figure 4).\nGlycolytic stress assay\n\t\nPreparation of compounds\n\t\t\nPrepare compounds at 10x concentration for glycolytic stress assay. Prepare 100 mM glucose, 100 µM Oligomycin, 500 mM 2-Deoxy Glucose (2DG) and 20 µM Antimycin A in the corresponding assay medium.\nAdd 50 µL glucose into port A, 55 µL Oligomycin into port B, 62 µL 2-DG into port C and 68 µL Antimycin A into port D.\nEmploy extra flux analyzer, which measures oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) of live cells in a 24-well plate format. Set up the assay protocol in advance.",
    "Open the extra flux analyzer and set up the assay template by using the assay wizard tab and follow step by step instruction to fill out all the information that pops out during the setup. Generate the group layout as similar to shown in Figure 5. Set up the protocol as shown in Table 1. Set up these layouts well ahead before assay and save in the computer. At the time of assay, restore the saved protocol by opening the corresponding file in the open file option in the assay wizard tab (Figure 5).\nLoad the 10x compounds in the respective ports of the hydrated sensor cartridge containing the calibrant and load in the carrier tray of the extra flux analyzer. Start the calibration by pressing the Start button on the screen.\nAdd 350 µL of the assay medium gently to the cell plate along the side of the wells to minimize cell disturbance to bring the final volume to 450 µL.\nReplace the utility plate containing the calibrant with the assay plate and continue.\nRemove the sensor cartridge and the plate once the assay is completed. Save the file in the appropriate destination folder.\n7. Data Analysis\nUse the area under the curve- analysis of variance (AUC-ANOVA) analysis tab in the software to calculate the significant difference between the groups by selecting the respective parameters (OCR or ECAR) as shown in Figure 6.\nSelect the groups that need to be compared.\nAdd to the analysis groups for ANOVA and click Ok.\n\tNOTE: This AUC ANOVA analysis will add a new sheet to the file in which the AUC is calculated for each group and compared between them by ANOVA. This will give a table of p values to show the significance.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
