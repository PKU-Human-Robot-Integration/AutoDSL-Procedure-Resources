    "1. GelMA Synthesis\nWeigh 10 g of gelatin powder and add it to a glass flask with 100 mL ofDulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS). Put a magnetic stir bar into the flask and place the flask on a stirring hot plate.\nCover the flask with aluminum foil to avoid water evaporation. Set the hot plate temperature to 50-60 °C and the stirrer at 100 rpm for 1 h to dissolve the gelatin powder well.\nAfter the gelatin has dissolved, add 8 mL of methacrylic anhydride very slowly (one drop per second) using a pipette. Let it react at 60 °C for 3 h.\nAdd pre-warmed DPBS (40 °C) to the flask to a final volume of 500 mL and allow this mix well for 15 min to stop the reaction.\nMeanwhile, cut a dialysis membrane (14 kDa cut-off molecular weight) into several 25 cm-long tubes. Immerse them in deionized (DI) water for 15 min and make a knot to close one end of the dialysis tubes.\nLoad the appropriate amount (30 - 60 mL) of the polymer solution into the dialysis tubes and close the other end. Place them in a 5-L plastic beaker with DI water for a week. Renew the DI water twice a day and maintain the solution at 40 - 50 °C during the dialysis process.\nCollect the solution from the tube in a 500-mL glass bottle. Pour ~450 - 500 mL of solution in a 500-mL filter cup (pore size of 0.22 µm) and apply a vacuum to the filter cup to force the solution to pass through the filter membrane for sterilization.\nTransfer the sterilized polymer into several 50-mL sterilized tubes and store them in a -80 °C freezer for 3 - 5 days.",
    "Freeze-dry the -80 °C polymer for 1 week using a freeze dryer to form GelMA. Store the GelMA in a -80 °C freezer.\n2. 3-(Trimethoxysilyl)propyl Methacrylate (TMSPMA) Modification\n Cut commercial glass slides into two small pieces (25 mm x 37.5 mm) and immerse them in 0.5 M NaOH solution for 4 h. Wash the slides with a large amount of DI water.\nPlace the slide on a rack inside a glass container with 95% ethanol and clean using an ultrasonicator at 43 kHz for 15 min. Air dry the glass slide.\nImmerse the glass slides in 5% TMSPMA in 99.5% ethanol for 1 h.\nWash the slides in 95% ethanol, air dry the slides, and anneal the TMSPMA coating in an oven at 80 °C for 2 h.\n3. Chip Fabrication\nTake one 2 mm- and one 0.3 mm-thick polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) plate, apply double-sided tape to one side of the PMMA surface, and release the liner on one side. Leave two 2 mm-thick PMMA plates and one 1 mm-thick plate without double-sided tape.\nLaser-cut a 2 mm-thick PMMA plate without double-sided tape to 42 mm x 30 mm to make the bottom plate. Cut a 2 mm-thick PMMA plate with double-sided tape to make the boundary frame, with outer dimensions of 42 mm x 30 mm and inner dimensions of 37.5 mm x 25 mm.\nLaser-cut the 0.3 mm-thick PMMA plate with double-sided tape into a 12-mm center circle with two 2 mm-wide and 8 mm-long flow channels on opposite sides of the circle (Figure 1a).\nTo prepare the PMMA mold for casting the PDMS cover, assemble the three pieces of PMMA components from steps 3.2-3.3 (Figure 1b) using double-sided tape.",
    "Laser-cut a 2 mm-thick PMMA plate with double-sided tape into a 5 cm x 5 cm piece with a 3 x 3 array of 8.5 mm x 8.5 mm hollow rectangles. Cut another 5 cm x 5 cm piece with a 3 x 3 array of 4-mm hollow circles. Laser-cut a 1 mm-thick PMMA plate without double-sided tape into a 5 cm x 5 cm PMMA bottom plate.\nPrepare the PMMA mold for casting the PDMS plug by assembling the three pieces of PMMA components from step 3.5 (Figure 1c) using double-sided tape.\nPrepare the PDMS cover and PDMS plug by properly mixing 30 g of PDMS elastomer and 3 g of PDMS curing agent; degas the mixture under a vacuum chamber for 1 h.\nCast 1.8-2.0 g of the mixture into the PMMA mold for the PDMS cover and use the appropriate amount to fill each cavity of the PMMA mold for the PDMS plug. Cast 10 g of uncured PDMS mixture in a blank 10-cm plastic plate. Put these molds in a vacuum chamber to degas for 30 min.\nCure the PDMS for 2 h at 80 °C. After cooling down the cured PDMS on the mold, detach the PDMS covers and the PDMS plugs from the PMMA molds.\nPunch two holes with diameters of about 3 mm at the ends of flow channels of the PDMS covers.\nCut the PDMS sheet molded from the 10-cm plastic plate into many 1 cm x 1 cm cubes and punch a 3-mm hole in each PDMS cube. Glue two uncured 1 cm x 1 cm PDMS cubes onto the openings of the PDMS cover (to serve as medium reservoirs and to aid in the curing process of the gradient circular hydrogel patterns) and cure for 1 h at 80 °C.",
    "Bond the PDMS covers with the two PDMS reservoirs onto a TMSPMA-coated slide by pre-treating the bonding side of the PDMS cover and the TMSPMA-coated slide under an oxygen plasma machine (30 W RF power (high mode) and 600 mTorr compressed air) or a high-frequency electronic corona generator (115 V, 50/60 Hz, 0.35 A) for 90 s of O2 plasma treatment.\nContact the plasma-treated surface of the PDMS covers and the TMSPMA slide and press them closely for permanent bonding through the formation of an Si-O-Si bond.\n\tNOTE: Placing the chip in an oven at 80 °C for 1 h can further enhance the bonding strength.\nAfter cooling, immerse the chips in 95% ethanol for 15 min and air dry. Then, sterilize the chips under UV irradiation for 1 h and store them in a box wrapped in aluminum foil in the laminar hood.\n4. Static Gradient Strain on the Cell-laden Hydrogel\nPrint and cut a piece of photomask, 25 mm x 37.5 mm in size, by printing the layout in Figure 2b on a transparent film. Adjust the printed size of Figure 2b to match the dimension in Figure 2a.\nPrepare 100 mL of DMEM medium with 10% FBS, 1% Pen-Strep, and 250 mL of DPBS in a 37 °C water bath to use as the cell culture medium.\nWeigh 25 mg of freeze-dried GelMA into 0.3 mL of prewarmed (37 °C) cell culture medium in a 1.5-mL black microcentrifuge tube. Put the microcentrifuge tube on a laboratory stirrer/hot plate until the GelMA dissolves in the medium.\nWeigh 50 mg of photoinitiator into 1 ml of DPBS in a microcentrifuge tube and place it in an 80 °C oven for 15 min or until the photoinitiator has dissolved.",
    "Take 25 µL of the 10% photoinitiator from step 4.4 and add it to the microcentrifuge tube from step 4.3. Pipette several times to mix well.\nCount 3 x 106 NIH 3T3 cells using an automated cell counter. Centrifuge the suspension at 200 x g for 5 min, discard the supernatant, and re-suspend the cells in 175 µL of cell culture medium.\nAdd the cell solution from step 4.6 to the microcentrifuge tube from step 4.5 to get a prepolymer cell solution of 5% GelMA, 0.5% photoinitiator, and ~6 x 106 3T3 cells/mL. After mixing, load 100 µL of cell prepolymer in a 100-µL micro syringe.\nManually align (see Figure 3a) a piece of the photomask onto the bottom slide of the sterilized gradient strain chip and simply fix the position using a small drop of DI water in between. Connect the 100-µL micro-syringe loaded with prepolymer cell solution to the inlet of the chip.\nPlace (see Figure 3b) 50 µL of prepolymer cell solution in the flow channel using the micro-syringe and then plug the outlet using a PDMS plug. Inject an extra 40 µL of solution to create a convex bulge in the circular PDMS membrane.\nMove the chip with the photomask (bottom), micro-syringe (inlet), and PDMS plug (outlet) from step 4.9 under a UV lamp (365 nm, 9 mW/cm2) and expose it for 30 - 45 s to crosslink the concentric circular hydrogel in the fluidic chamber.\nRemove the PDMS plug and the micro-syringe to release the liquid pressure (see Figure 3c). Use a 1-mL syringe loaded with prewarmed DPBS to wash out uncrosslinked resins 3 times by flushing from the inlet to the outlet.\nFill the flow channel with about 100 µL of cell culture medium.",
    "Place the chip in a sterilized culture dish and culture in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C for a week. Refresh the medium every day.\nTake images of three chips on day 0 after 4 h of incubation, as a control group, and three chips on day 3, as the experimental set, using a microscope with a 20X objective. Measure the line width of each hydrogel from line 1 to line 12 using software (e.g., ImageJ) to calculate the compress strains ( Figure 4).\n\tNOTE: The elongation percentage is calculated by dividing the value of the line width difference between 40 µL and 0 µL by the line width at 40 µL.\n5. Cell Staining for Alignment Analysis\nUse a syringe to inject 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in DPBS at RT into the flow chip for 15 min for the fixation of the cell-laden hydrogel.\n\tNOTE: Caution. PFA is toxic and should be handled with care.\nReplace the solution with 0.5% cell membrane permeating solution in DPBS for 10 min to permeabilize the cell membrane at RT.\nPBS wash the samples 3 times with 5- to 10-min interval between washes (using a loaded syringe, as in step 5.1).\nLoad 1% BSA solution into the fluidic channel for 45-60 min at RT (using a loaded syringe through the inlet port).\nAdd 1.5 mL of methanol into the vial with Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin to yield a final concentration of 6.6 µM stock solution.\nTake 5 µL of Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin from step 5.5 and dilute it in 200 µL of DPBS with 0.1% BSA to form a final concentration of 0.165 µM Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin.",
    "Add 200 µL of the mixture solution to the fluidic channel using a micropipette and incubate the chip at 37 °C for 45 - 60 min for actin staining. PBS wash (as above) the samples 3 times.\nPrepare 1 µg/mL DAPI in PBS, flow it through the chip, and stain cell nuclei at 37 °C for 5 min.\nPipette DPBS into the fluidic channel to wash out the staining solution and refill the fluidic chamber with PBS solution to take images with a fluorescence microscope.\nCapture the fluorescent images of the 3T3 cells in the hydrogels using an inverted fluorescence microscope under 40X magnification with a CCD detector and filter sets of ex/em at 488/520 nm and 358/461 nm for Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin (actin) and DAPI (nucleus), respectively.\nSubscription Required.
