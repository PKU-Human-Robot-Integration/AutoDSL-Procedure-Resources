    "An exempt approval (3002-13) to carry out research using de-identified tissue samples pursuant to the Department of Health and Human Services regulations, 45 CFR 46.101(b)(4) was granted. Full thickness skin is received from elective surgery. In this article, the tissue source is 66-year-old Caucasian female breast.\n1. Preparation of Elastomer Coated Coverslips\nIn a 20 mL glass vial, mix 0.107 g of Sylgard 184 curing agent with 5.893 g base. The total mixture mass is 6 g with a base to curing agent ratio of 55:1.\nAfter mixing with a glass rod to ensure homogeneity, place the glass vial in a vacuum chamber and degas to remove all bubbles.\nPlace a glass cover-slip (55 mm x 25 mm) in the center of a spin coater. Add ~1 mL of the mixture onto the center of the cover-slip. Use a 5,000 µL pipette with the end cut off with scissors. Spin coat the cover-slip at 2,000 rpm for 60 s.\n\t\nRepeat this process to create 5-6 substrates.\nCure the cover-slips in an oven for 12 h at 60 °C.\nUse a razor blade to partially remove the elastomer film from a sacrificial substrate. Use an indelible marker to mark the topside of the elastomer film and the exposed glass.\nMount the sample on an inverted microscope and use a remote focus accessory to record the difference in z-height between the focal planes of the two marks. This corresponds to the elastomer substrate thickness, h.\n2. Preparation of the Stratum Corneum\nUse a water bath or heated stir plate to heat a glass beaker half filled with deionized water (DW) to 60 °C. Inside a biological safety cabinet, immerse the full thickness human skin in the water for 4 min.",
    "Immediately transfer the skin sample into a beaker containing DW cooled to <10 °C for 4 min. Half filling the beaker minimizes splashing of biohazardous material.\nRemove the skin from the beaker, place in a Petri dish, and gently isolate the epidermis using a pair of bent nosed tissue tweezers.\nPlace the isolated epidermis basal side down in a Petri dish lined with gauze. Ensure the basal layer is fully in contact with the gauze.\n\t\nSoak the gauze in a 0.25% (wt/vol) type IX-S porcine pancreas trypsin solution dissolved in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline for 6-8 h at room temperature. Add only enough trypsin in the container to wet the gauze.\nLift the gauze with tissue tweezers and float it in a container partially filled with DW. Gently pull the SC to separate it from the gauze.\nWash the stratum corneum 3-4 times in DW to remove residual epidermal tissue that remains attached to the SC.\nFloat the isolated SC in a solution of 0.4% glycine max(soybean) trypsin inhibitor in DW. Use a plate shaker to agitate the tissue for 10 min.\nFloat SC in a Petri dish partially filled with DW. Use a plate shaker to agitate the tissue for 10 min.\nDry the isolated SC sheet on an ultra-fine plastic mesh for 48 h at room temperature (25 °C, 40% relative humidity (R.H.)).\nSeparate the SC from the mesh and cut out individual circular R=3 mm radius samples using a circular hole punch. Mark the center of the outmost face with a small spiral mark using an indelible marker. This provides a visual cue for recognizing the topside of the SC.",
    "NOTE: The indelible mark should be applied in the center of the sample, where the drying deformations will be smallest. This will minimize the impact of the marker on recorded drying displacement profiles.\n3. Sample Treatment and Deposition\nAgitate SC samples for 30 min in 15 mL DW containing 90 µL fluorescent marker beads (505/515 nm, 1 µm diameter, carboxylate-modified). This deposits beads onto the SC surface\n\tNOTE: While deposition of large numbers of beads on the SC may marginally slow drying relative to samples without beads present12, it will maximize the spatial resolution of the in-plane deformation fields that can be subsequently obtained. The choice of bead volume added should therefore be made ad hoc.\nRemove SC samples and place them in a Petri dish partially filled with DW.\nPartially immerse a substrate in the DW at a shallow angle of 15-30°.\nPin an edge of the floating SC sample at the contact line between the substrate and water interface. Vertically withdrawing the substrate from the water will smoothly laminate the SC sample to the substrate without wrinkles or entrapped air bubbles.\nRepeat step 3.4 to place up to 6 SC samples onto each substrate. Leave at least a 2-3 mm gap between samples and avoid sample lamination close to the substrate edge. This prevents drying of one sample influencing drying displacements in another.\nDry the mounted SC samples in laboratory conditions for 60 min. This allows residual water between the SC and substrate to evaporate and ensures complete tissue adhesion.",
    "NOTE: At this juncture, SC samples can be treated with a chemical or cosmetic formulations7,8 by placing the substrates upside down in a desired solution for a requisite period of time. Repeat step 3.6 once the treatment step is performed. After drying, incomplete adhesion of SC samples to the substrate can be verified using transmitted light microscopy. Trapped bubbles under the SC sample or delaminated edges will form clear contrast variations in the sample with well-defined edges.\nCreate a humidity chamber by placing a Petri dish partially filled with water into a hermetically sealed container.\nPlace substrates into the chamber for 24 h to equilibrate to a relative humidity of 99%. Do not place the substrates into the Petri dish.\n4. Microscope Environmental Control\nAchieve control of environmental conditions through a humidity control system connected to a microscope mountable perfusion chamber. Details of the humidity control system are provided in German et al. (2013)7 and Liu and German (2015)8.\nMount the substrate on the microscope, place the perfusion chamber over the substrate and seal edges of perfusion chamber to the elastomer using vacuum grease.\nOnce mounted, equilibrate internal air to 99% R.H. prior to experimentation. This prevents evaporation of water prior to experimentation. Once imaging in sections 5 or 7 has begun, reduce internal air humidity to desired value.\n\tNOTE: In this article, SC samples are dried to 25% R.H.\n5. Imaging in Plane Drying Displacements\nAcquire images of SC samples using an inverted microscope with 1X objective lens. Excite fluorescent beads using a light engine with FITC filter (503-530 nm emission bandpass). Multiple samples can be imaged sequentially throughout drying using an automated x-y stage.",
    "Record fluorescent and transmitted light images using a digital CCD camera at a resolution of 1,392 x 1,040 pixels. The field of view of each image is 8.98 x 6.71 mm, allowing a single image to capture a full SC sample. Take images with a frequency of 10 min for 16 h.\n6. Substrate Preparation for Thickness Measurement\nIn a chemical fume hood, place 1 mL silane (3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane; ≥98%) in some small plastic cap. Place elastomer substrates from section 1 and the cap in a sealed container for 5 h. Do not allow substrates to come directly in contact with the silane.\nAdd 5 mg of EDC (N-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-N-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride; ≥99%) in a 1.5 mL tube. Add 500 µL of DW to the EDC. Agitate the solution for 10 s with a vortex mixer.\nAdd 0.076 g sodium tetraborate and 0.1 g boric acid to 20 mL DW. Mix using a magnetic stirrer at 70 °C (1 h). Add boric acid until the pH is 7.4.\nAdd 20 mL of borate buffer to a 50 mL centrifuge tube. Add 60 µL of 1 µm beads (535/575 nm, carboxylate-modified) to the borate buffer. Finally, add 200 µL of EDC solution to bottle. Shake the tube to mix bead solution and then pour into a 10 cm diameter Petri dish.\nRemove the silanated substrates from the container and place them elastomer film-side down into the bead solution. Do so slowly to prevent bubbles from becoming trapped. Two substrates will fit in each Petri dish.\nLeave substrates to float in the bead solution for 45 min.\nUse tweezers to remove the substrates from the bead solution, then rinse in DW to remove unbound beads.\nAir dry the substrates. Blowing compressed air over the elastomer film surface reduces the formation of water spots.",
    "Seal the substrates in an opaque box to prevent photo-bleaching of the beads until SC sample deposition.\n7. Imaging Thickness of SC\nDeposit SC samples on to a substrate using section 3. However, perform step 3.1 without adding fluorescent beads to the DW. Additionally, apply a 5 µL drop of undiluted fluorescent marker bead solution (505/515 nm, 0.1 µm diameter) to the surface of each deposited SC sample with a pipette before completing step 3.6.\nEstablish measurements of SC thickness using the microscope with 40X objective lens. Measure the thickness of SC samples over time using a remote focus accessory to record the difference in z-height between the two bead layer focal planes located at the SC-substrate interface and the topside of the SC.\nMeasure the thickness of 3 regions of each SC sample over a 3 h drying period. The thickness of SC samples reaches a steady state value within this time frame8.\n8. Quantifying and Modeling Tissue Deformation\nUse particle image velocimetry13 to obtain spatially resolved in-plane drying displacements from the fluorescent images at each recorded time step.\nUse MATLAB to obtain azimuthally averaged radial and azimuthal displacement profiles from the displacement field of each radially symmetric SC sample.\n\tNOTE: An example dataset (entitled 'd.mat') and MATLAB code (entitled 'PIV-processing.m') that performs both this step and step 8.3 has been provided in the supplemental information.\nFit radial displacement profiles to a model7,8,14,15,16 describing drying SC as a shrinking linear elastic circular disk of time varying thickness, hSC, radius, R, and elastic modulus, ESC, adhered to a deformable elastic substrate with elastic modulus, E. Assume SC has a well-defined and constant Poisson's ratio, νSC = 0.47,8. Obtain best fits using a minimum least squares approach.",
    "NOTE: The model used for fitting describes radial displacements in terms of modified Bessel functions are:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55336/55336eq2.jpg             (1)\n\twith imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55336/55336eq3.jpg, imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55336/55336eq4.jpg and imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55336/55336eq13.jpg\n\tThe term imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55336/55336eq6.jpg corresponds to a penetration depth given by,\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55336/55336eq7.jpg.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55336/55336eq8.jpg denotes a substrate rigidity parameter; valid when sample sizes are much greater than the substrate thickness.

The Poisson's ratio of the silicone elastomer substrate17 is ν = 0.5.\nObtain model parameters α and β at each time step from the least squares fit of Equation (1) to the radial displacement profile.\n\t\nEmploy the fitting parameter β to obtain SC elastic modulus, ESC, using the expression,\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55336/55336eq11.jpg\nUse fitting parameter α to obtain the time varying contractile drying stress, PSC, using the expression,\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55336/55336eq12.jpg\nSubscription Required.
