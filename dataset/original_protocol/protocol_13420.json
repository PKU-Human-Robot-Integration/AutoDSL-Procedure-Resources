    "All animal experiments in this protocol were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. All mice were housed at a 12:12 light cycle in pathogen-free rooms. See the Table of Materials for details related to all materials, animals, and equipment used in this protocol.\n1. Construction of the silicone balloon catheter\nNOTE: The silicone balloon is made as described previously13.\nAdd 9.5 mL of distilled water, 14.2 mL of light corn syrup, and 33.8 g of sucrose to a 100 mL beaker. Heat and stir the solution until the sugar is completely dissolved.\nPrepare the dough by mixing 10 g of wheat flour and 5 g of water until an even consistency is achieved and allow it to rest for 10 min.\nShape a small piece of dough into an oval-the \"head\"-and attach it to the end of a dry spaghetti strand. Then, dip this head into the sugar solution and slowly remove from the solution, as the head is now completely coated.\n\tNOTE: The dough should be smooth and of even texture. The sizes of dough can be varied to generate different sizes of balloons, from 5 mm (short diameter) to 7 mm (long diameter). Try to cover them with a thin film of sugar solution.\nSuspend the spaghetti strand on a polystyrene foam block, or other holders, to form a glossy cover evenly over the head and dry overnight.\nDip the mold into silicone dispersion (silicone elastomer dispersed in xylene). Place the spaghetti strand back into the polystyrene foam block at 37 °C for 2 h or until dry. Repeat this step once.\n\tNOTE: It is essential to prevent the silicone dispersion gel from oxidizing due through air exposure, as this will generate an uneven balloon thickness.",
    "Place the mold into the water to separate and collect the balloon. Store the balloon in 0.02% sodium azide.\nCut a two-blunt-end tip from a 22 G needle; mount one blunt end to the silicone balloon and another blunt end to PE tubing. Use 4-0 silk to tie the balloon in place on the needle.\n\t​NOTE: Test the balloon integrity by injecting water into it. Once the balloon is filled, press the balloon softly to test if the balloon maintains tension inside. Use a new balloon if it is leaking. The mounted balloons can be stored for future use.\n2. Preparation of the heart perfusion system\nMake 1 L of Krebs-Henseleit (KH) perfusion buffer and transfer it to the water reservoir Langendorff system.\nConnect the air tube to the water reservoir and turn on the airflow to balance the KH buffer with 5% CO2 and 95% O2 for at least 30 min.\nSet the water bath at 41.5 °C and circulate the water in the outer layer of the Langendorff system to warm up the system and KH buffer.\n\t​NOTE: The water bath temperature requires optimization for each system. For this system, the water bath temperature will maintain the KH at 37-37.5 °C when perfusing into the heart.\n3. Isolation, mounting, and cannulating of the mouse heart\nFor anticoagulation, adminster 200 units of heparin in Saline by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection into the right-hand quadrant of C57/B6 mouse abdomen. Aspirate the syringe before injection to confirm the bevel of the needles is not in the bladder or lumen of the GI tract. Use at least four mice in each experimental condition (but also consider the size of the treatment effect).",
    "After 30 min, administer 80 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg of xylazine i.p. to anesthetize the mouse. Check if the anesthetized mouse is unconscious by performing a toe pinch and ensuring no response is observed. Acepromazine 2mg/kg can be added to the ket/xyl cocktail if the used strain of mice does not reach an adequate level of anesthesia with ket/xyl only.\nMake an incision right below the sternum. Use scissors to open the chest by cutting the diaphragm and the ribs. Fold the anterior chest wall to fully expose the chest. Cut at the descending aorta (closed to the aorta arch). Transfer the heart, lungs, and thymus of the mouse to cold histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) buffer. Isolate the organs under ice-cold HTK buffer. Expose the aorta by removing any connective tissues.\n\t\tNOTE: Maximize the aorta length by including both the ascending aorta and aortic arch region in the excision to allow enough space to connect to a needle.\nConnect the end of the aorta to a 22 G needle, and tie with a 6-0 silk suture. Ensure the cannula is above the aortic root so as not to interfere with the aortic valve. Perfuse the aorta with 10 mL of cold (4 °C) HTK buffer over approximately 10 min.\n\tNOTE: It takes less than 15 min from heart removal to cannulation of the aorta; However, it is important to keep the perfusion speed at the appropriate level. Injections that are too fast and vigorous can generate high pressures and cause vascular/cardiac damage.\nStore the heart in a 50 mL tube with ice-cold HTK for 8 h or immediately perform the perfusion (do not store the control) and avoid direct contact with ice.\n\tNOTE: Direct contact of the heart tissue with ice may lead to cold injury.",
    "Connect the needle-mounted heart to the cannula in the Langendorff apparatus and tie it with a silk suture.\n\tNOTE: To standardize the procedure, wait for a total of 3 min for the cannulation process before perfusion.\nStart the perfusion with a constant flow mode at 3 mL/min; then, change to constant pressure mode at 70-80 mmHg and adjust the heart to ~6 mL/min.\n\tNOTE: Palpating the heart softly can help accelerate cardiac reanimation. If the perfusion flow rate is much higher than 6 mL/min at constant pressure mode, there could be a leak in the cannulation or the aorta valve may not be working properly. Adjust the connections to fix the leak. The constant flow mode overrides the vascular tone self-regulation of the heart. The constant pressure mode allows the heart to regulate its coronary perfusion flow. Therefore, the constant pressure mode will precisely measure the cardiac function and preservation quality of the heart.\nConnect a deflated, water-filled balloon to a pressure transducer and a water-filled syringe with a three-way tap. After a 15-20 min equilibration period, cut the right atrium (RA) and insert the balloon to the RV through the RA. Use tape to hold the balloon inside the RV. Minimize the open area of the RA to help constrain the balloon in the ventricle (see Figure 1 for the setup).\n\tNOTE: A period of equilibration is necessary, as the cardiac contraction and relaxation are not stable at the beginning, and the measure is less accurate and representative. If the AV node is damaged during the opening of the RA, the heart will display frequent arrhythmias.",
    "After 20 min of RV functional data collection, cut the left atrium (LA) and insert a deflated water-filled balloon to the LV through the LA. Use tape to hold the balloon inside the LV.\n\t​NOTE: The heart should maintain stable hemodynamics for more than 1.5 h.\n4. Functional data recording\nCalibration of the pressure transducer\n\t\nFill a 10 mL syringe with warm saline and connect the syringe to the dome through a three-way tap. Open the tap and slowly fill the dome with saline, and then close all taps and remove the syringe. Attach the filled dome to the transducer; connect the pressure gauge to the third end of the three-way tap.\nIn the recording software, select the Bridge Amp from the dropdown menu of the channel connecting to the transducer. Rename the channel as Perfused pressure. Click Zero to zero the transducer.\nStart the recording by clicking Start so that the transducer is now reading 0 mmHg. After several seconds of recording, slowly push the syringe and increase the pressure to 100. Click stop to stop recording.\nIn the Units conversion dialog, select an area of recording for 0 mmHg and click the arrow to Point 1 and type 0 mmHg. Select area of recording for 100 mmHg, click the arrow to Point 2, and type 100 mmHg. Click OK to calibrate the transducer.\nRename the channel corresponding to the pressure transducer with the balloon as Ventricle pressure. Start the recording when the heart is connected to the system. After inserting the balloon into the ventricle, adjust the water volume in the balloon using a micrometer syringe through the three-way tap to maintain the end-diastolic pressure at 5-10 mmHg.\n\tNOTE: The end-diastolic measure could decrease during the measurement, preferably starting at close to 10 mmHg.",
    "Rename an empty channel as dP/dt. From the dropdown menu, select Derivative | source channel as Ventricle Pressure. The channel will record the ratio of pressure change in the ventricular cavity during the contraction period.\nSelect a stable period of measure, then click Setting on the Blood pressure module.\n\t\nSelect the Ventricle pressure as the input channel and click selection for a period of calculation | OK.\nClick Classifier view to remove the outlier cardiac cycle (e.g., abnormal cycle time or pressure).\nClick table view to generate the tables of the average of max dP/dt (contraction) and min dP/dt (relaxation) for the selected period.\n\t\tNOTE: Store the recording file for each sample and save the table of average heart function for statistical analysis."
