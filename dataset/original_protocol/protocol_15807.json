    "All experimental procedures were conducted in agreement with the Ethics Committee for Human and Animal Experimentation of the Canton of Geneva, the Cantonal Commission for Research Ethics (CCER), and the General Direction Of The Health Of The Canton Of Geneva (Switzerland), respectively. Data are reported following Animal Research: Reporting In-vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines.\n1. SPECT camera preparation and calibration\nTurn on the camera, load the operating software (see Table of Materials). Click on the Home XYZ Stage button to perform homing.\nSet up the experiment composed of one 10 min scan acquisition. Set the Step mode to Fine and the Acquisition mode to the Listmode (to record the entire emission spectrum).\nSet up the bed and ensure that the warming system, breathing sensor, and anesthesia are functional and secure (Figure 1A-D). Then, place a phantom (i.e., 2 mL of a known concentration of 125I in a 2 mL microfuge tube) where the animal's head will be positioned (centered on the area, Figure 1E).\nSet the scan area by sliding the cursors for the three dimensions with the help of the three images in the bottom part of the screen. Ensure that the scan volume of the phantom and the animal is the same.\nStart the phantom scan for subsequent calibration with the parameters established in steps 1.2-1.4.\n2. Workspace setup for SPECT imaging\nClean the workspace with disinfectant virucide and place soft papers on all the surfaces.\nEnsure that there is enough isoflurane and oxygen in their respective tanks.\nPrepare a 24 G catheter by cutting off the fins of the butterfly catheter to have a clearer view of the rat tail vein.",
    "Coat the catheter by filling it completely with heparin solution (25000 U/mL) after removing the needle. Then, place the needle back in it to avoid blood clot formation following catheter insertion.\n3. [125I]CLINDE radiotracer synthesis\nCAUTION: Radioactivity can have sufficient ionizing energy to affect the atoms of the living cells and damage their genetic material (DNA).\nEnsure to work in an appropriate environment, authorized for experiments involving radioactivity.\n\tNOTE: Wear the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), for radioactivity handling, including finger and body dosimeters. Try to stay at a safe distance from any source of radioactivity.\nIncubate 100 µg of tributylin precursor in 100 µL of acetic acid with sodium iodide (Na125I) (see Table of Materials) and 5 µL of 37% peracetic acid at 70 °C for 20 min in a thermocycler positioned in a glove box.\nDilute the reaction using 50% acetonitrile (ACN) in water to reach a volume of 500 µL. Inject the 500 µL of the diluted reaction onto a reverse-phase column (see Table of Materials).\nIsolate the [125I]CLINDE with a linear gradient HPLC run from 5%-95% ACN in 7 mM H3PO4 for 10 min. Dilute the isolate in H2O to attain a final volume of 10 mL, and then inject the diluted reaction onto a concentration column (see Table of Materials).\nElute the [125I]CLINDE from the column with 300 µL of absolute ethanol, and then evaporate the ethanol by incubating it in a vacuum centrifuge at RT for 40 min.\nDilute the residue containing the [125I]CLINDE in 300 µL of sterile saline to create a stock solution.\nAfter measuring its radioactivity, dilute the stock solution in sterile saline to obtain a solution of 0.037 MBq in 500 µL.",
    "Purify the tracer by HPLC (High-performance liquid chromatography). Determine the elution time using a standard calibration at 450 nm, and isolate the single radioactive peak. Perform the standard calibration curve using seven standard concentrations of cold (non-radioactive) CLINDE (0.1 µg, 0.5 µg, 0.75 µg, 1 µg, 1.5 µg, 2 µg, and 5 µg in 400 µL of a solution of 50% ACN). Establish the radiochemical purity by measuring a single peak in radio TLC (Thin layer chromatography). Ensure that the purity of the radiochemical is above 60%.\nCheck the specific activity of the radioligand measuring ultraviolet absorbance at 450 nm and the calibration curves established with cold reference compounds. Ensure that the specific activity is greater than 1000 GBq/µmol.\n4. [125I]R91150 radiotracer synthesis\nNOTE: Ensure to follow the same security rules as mentioned in the CLINDE synthesis section.\nMix 300 µg of R91150 precursor in a solution of 3 µL of absolute ethanol, 3 µL of glacial acetic acid, 15 µL of carrier-free Na125I (see Table of Materials) (10 mCi) in 0.05 M NaOH and 3 µL of 30% H2O2. Incubate for 30 min in a glove box.\nInject the entire reaction into a reverse-phase column (see Table of Materials).\nIsolate [125I]R91150 by isocratic HPLC run (ACN/water 50/50, 10 mM acetic acid buffer) with a flow rate of 3 mL/min.\nDilute [125I]R91150 in H2O for a final volume of 10 mL.\nInject 10 mL of the diluted reaction onto a concentration column (see Table of Materials).\nElute [125I]R91150 from the column with 300 µL of absolute ethanol.\nEvaporate the ethanol by incubating it in a vacuum centrifuge at RT for 40 min.\nDilute the residue containing [125I]R91150 in 300 µL of saline.",
    "Purify the tracer by HPLC. Determine the elution time using a standard calibration at 450 nm and isolate the single radioactive peak. Establish the radiochemical purity by measuring a single peak in radio TLC. Ensure that the purity of the radiochemical is above 98%.\n5. Animal preparation\nWeigh and anesthetize the TgF344-AD rat (male or female, from 2-24 months old) in an induction chamber with 3% isoflurane. Once deeply anesthetized, lower the isoflurane flow to 2% (0.4 L/min, 100% O2) in the chamber.\nPosition the animal on a pre-warmed bed equipped with an anesthesia nosecone. Maintain isoflurane at 2% (0.4 L/min, 100% O2).\nApply eye gel lubricant in the animal's eyes and confirm the depth of anesthesia via respiratory monitoring; adjust anesthesia if necessary.\nPerform the 24 G catheter insertion in the tail vein.\n6. SPECT acquisition\nTransfer the animal to the camera bed equipped with a temperature-controlled heating pad set to 38°C (Figure 1E).\nSecure the head of the animal onto the bite bar and fix the head supports.\nSet up the experiment on a 60 min scan constituting 60 frames of 1 min. Reuse all other parameters set up in step 1. Click on the Update Image button to update the animal position.\nSet the scan area by sliding the cursors with the help of the three images in the bottom part of the screen for the three dimensions.\nInject 500 µL of the radioactive radiotracer ([125I]CLINDE or [125I]R91150), and then flush the tube with 300 µL of sterile 0.9% NaCl. Simultaneously click on Start Acquisition to start the scan.\nDuring the scan time, ensure to maintain the animal under constant anesthesia with respiration rate monitoring. Adjust the flow of isoflurane if needed.\nOnce the scan is over, quickly euthanize the anesthetized animal by decapitation.\n7. Scan reconstruction",
    "Open the scan reconstruction software (see Table of Materials), and then open the data set, looking for the [filename].parameters file, created in the folder of the scan.\nSelect the isotope of interest. Note that the Listmode parameter allows multiple isotope selection at this step.\nSelect the following parameters: 0.4 mm Voxel size, 4 (POS-EM) subsets, 6 iterations (24ME-EM equivalent), no post-filter, and the isotope corresponding Decay Correction. Select the output format to NIfTI, and then select Start SPECT reconstruction.\n8. Rat brain extraction\nIn the same anesthetic event as the scanning procedure and after ensuring the deep anesthesia state of the animal by monitoring its respiratory rate, proceed to the decapitation by guillotine and quickly transfer the head to the dissection bench.\nWith scissors, carefully cut the skin on top of the head from the back to the front till the middle of the eyes.\nCut off the excess muscles around the base of the skull and the cervical vertebras.\nNext, carefully place one blade of the scissors in the hole at the back of the skull, the foramen magnum, and remove the back part of the skull with surgical pliers.\nThen, with surgical pliers, carefully remove the top part of the skull. The skull of old male rats can be thick, remove as small pieces to avoid damage to the brain.\nCarefully cut the meninges with scissors. Meninges can damage the brain during the extraction process; remove it as a precaution.\nAfter removing the top part of the skull, turn the head of the animal around, and with a small flat spatula, carefully pull the brain out by cutting the optic and trigeminal nerves.\nCarefully transfer the brain onto a flat, clean glass surface for dissection on ice.",
    "Use a flat metal spatula and a razor blade to dissect the regions of interest of the brain. Place the tissues in a 2 mL centrifuge tube and weigh the tissue obtained. Use the brain section directly for cell isolation or quickly freeze it in liquid nitrogen for later use.\n9. Cell isolation\nMake sure to work in a clean and sterile environment. Working under a class-II biosafety cabinet (BSC) is advised. Ensure that the gloves and every piece of equipment introduced into the BSC are sterile.\nTo prepare the cells for cell sorting, follow the protocol from Jaclyn M. Schwarz14.\n\tNOTE: In this experiment, a commercially available Neural dissociation kit (see Table of Materials) was used for cell preparation.\n\t\nPut the samples into a 2 mL centrifuge tube with 1 mL of HBSS (Ca- and Mg-free), and then centrifuge (300 x g, 2 min, room temperature = RT) and remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.\nAdd 1900 µL of enzyme mix-1 and incubate it for 15 min at 37 °C while agitating the tubes by inversion every 5 min.\nAdd 30 µL of enzyme mix-2, agitate gently with pipette 1 (see Table of Materials) back and forth 30 times. Then, incubate for 15 min at 37 °C while agitating the tubes by inversion every 5 min.\nMix gently back and forth with pipette 2, and then pipette 3 before incubating for 10 min at 37 °C to dissociate the tissues.\nFilter the cells with an 80 µm cell strainer, add 10 mL of HBSS (Ca- and Mg-free). Centrifuge (300 x g, 10 min, RT) and remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.",
    "For myelin depletion, resuspend the pellet with 400 µL of myelin removal buffer (see Table of Materials), and then add 100 µL of myelin removal beads (see Table of Materials), before incubating for 15 min at 4 °C.\nAdd 5 mL of myelin removal buffer, centrifuge (300 x g, 10 min, RT), and remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.\nAdd 500 µL of myelin removal buffer and place the tube into the magnetic field column. Wash the column with 1 mL of myelin removal buffer four times.\nCentrifuge (300 x g, 2 min, RT) and remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet. Vortex briefly (2 s) to dissociate the cells and add 5 µL of Fc block CD32. Vortex again and incubate for 5 min at 4 °C.\nAdd 100 µL of the mix of primary antibodies of interest; incubate for 20 min at 4 °C.\nCentrifuge (350 x g, 5 min, 4 °C) and remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet. Blot the tubes upside-down on soft paper.\nAfter a brief vortex (2 s), add 100 µL of the secondary antibody mix and incubate for 15 min at 4 °C.\nAdd 2 mL of myelin removal buffer, centrifuge (350 x g, 5 min, 4 °C) and remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet. Blot the tubes upside-down on soft paper. Resuspend the cells in 250 µL of sterile PBS and proceed directly to cell sorting.\n10. Cell sorting\nPrepare the microfuge tube with 500 µL of sterile PBS for collecting the sorted cells.\nAdd 10 µL of Hoechst per 1000 µL of cell solution to color the nuclei of the living cells and distinguish them from the dead cells.\nTransfer the cells as soon as possible to the cell sorting machine at 4 °C.",
    "First, sort the cells by forward and side scatter, and then sort the Hoechst positive cells. Next, sort the cells based on the antibodies of interest. Collect the positively stained cells separately. Make sure to distinguish the positive cells from the autofluorescent ones.\nCount the number of sorted cells for each pool of interest.\n11. Gamma counting\nCalibrate the γ counting system with 10 µL of the same phantom solution used for the SPECT calibration but dilute it in 1 mL of water.\n\tNOTE: The phantom solution is diluted because of the enhanced precision of the γ counting system.\nPlace the tube of sorted cells in the γ counting system and proceed with the γ counting according to the manufacturer's protocol.\nSubscription Required.
