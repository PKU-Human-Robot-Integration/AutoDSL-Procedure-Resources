    "1. Cell preparation for suspension cell culture\nCulture glioma stem-like cells in stem cell culture media at approximately 5 x 106 cell/10 cm plates in a cell culture incubator with 5% CO2, 95% relative humidity at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: The cell culture condition is the same throughout all the procedures. The media used in the protocol are complete media.\nTwo days before scheduled irradiation, collect glioma stem-like cells from the culture plate with a sterile 5 mL pipette into a 15 mL centrifuge tube in a culture hood.\nCentrifuge the collected cells at 200 x g for 3 min in a countertop centrifuge.\nDiscard the supernatant and digest the cell pellet (about 1 x 107 cells) with 1 mL of trypsin-EDTA at room temperature for 5 minutes to make a single cell suspension in trypsin-EDTA. Gently shake the bottom of centrifuge tube every 2 minutes during digestion to make sure the cells are digested thoroughly.\nAdd 3 mL of stem cell culture media (see the Table of Materials) to quench trypsin. Centrifuge the collected cells at 200 x g for 3 min in a counter top centrifuge. Discard the supernatant and save the cell pellet.\nResuspend the cells with 5 mL of cell culture media and count the cells with a hemocytometer.\nPlate 5 x 106 cells in two 10 cm plates containing 10 mL of cell culture media.\nRight before the scheduled irradiation, collect the cells and discard the supernatant after centrifugation as described in step 1.3. Re-suspend the cell pellet with 5 mL of cell culture media. Transfer 1 mL of cell suspension into a 35 mm plate containing 2 mL of cell culture media.",
    "NOTE: The total volume of media is 3 mL in the 35 mm plate to make the liquid 1 cm in height in the plate.  \nTransfer the plated cells in a secondary container, such as a plastic or foam box, to reduce the risk of contamination and bring the cells in the container to the irradiation facility on the utility cart.\nIrradiate the cells as described in step 4.\n2. Cell preparation for attached cell culture\nOne day before irradiation, in the cell culture hood, remove the DMEM media from the cell culture plate of the attached cell line, such as HEK-293 cells. The media can be suctioned using a Pasteur pipette connected to a vacuum.\nWash cells with 5 mL of sterile PBS to the culture dish to rinse off residual media.\nPipette 1 mL of trypsin-EDTA into the culture dish and gently tilt the culture plate to make sure that the entire dish is covered with trypsin-EDTA.\nTrypsinize cells at room temperature for 5 min. Quench the trypsin-EDTA reaction with 3 mL of DMEM media and collect cells with a 5 mL pipette into 15 mL centrifuge tube in the culture hood.\nCentrifuge the collected cells at 200 x g for 3 min in a counter top centrifuge. Discard the supernatant and save the cell pellet.\nResuspend the cells with 5 mL of DMEM media and count the cells with a hemocytometer.\nPlate 2 x 105 cells in a 35 mm plate using 3 mL of cell culture media to a height of 1 cm of  media.\nAfter 24 h of cell culture in the incubator at 37 °C, transfer the plated cells in a secondary container (i.e., an insulated foam box) to the irradiation facility on a utility cart.\nIrradiate cells as described in step 4.",
    "3. Cell preparation for immunostaining following irradiation\nThaw commercial extracellular protein matrix on ice at 4 °C overnight. Pre-chill 200 µL pipette tips and 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes at 4 °C overnight.\nAliquot extracellular protein matrix with pre-chilled pipette tips and 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes at 200 µL per tube.\nDilute 200 µL of extracellular protein matrix in pre-chilled 20 mL of cell culture media to make 1% extracellular protein matrix media.\nPlace a sterilized coverslip (22 mm x 22 mm) in a 35 mm plate. Place 400 µL of 1% extracellular protein matrix media on the coverslip.\nPlace the 35 mm plate into the cell culture incubator  at 37 °C for 1 h to allow the extracellular protein matrix to polymerize on the coverslip.\nWhen using suspension cell culture, make a single cell suspension as described in steps 1.1 to 1.5.\nPlate 5 x 104 cells on an extracellular protein matrix-coated coverslip placed in a 35 mm plate. Return plated cells to the cell culture incubator overnight to ensure that cells are supported by the protein matrix. The total volume of the media in the plate should be 3 mL to make the height of media reach 1 cm in the culture dish.\nObserve the cells under a bright field microscope with 10x magnification objective lens. The cells should spread out on the coverslip instead of floating. Transfer the culture dish with plated cells into a secondary container such as a foam box to the irradiation facility on a utility cart and irradiate the cells as described in step 4.",
    "When using attached cell cultures (for example, HEK-293 cells), digest cells as described in steps 2.1 to 2.6. Place 5 x 104 cells on a sterile cover slip in a 35 mm plate one day prior to the irradiation to make sure cells are fully attached to the coverslip surface by observing them under a microscope as in step 3.9. Use 3 mL of DMEM media to make the liquid 1 cm in height in the plate.\nAfter growing cells on coverslips overnight or up to one day, transfer the culture dish with plated cells in a secondary container to the irradiation facility. A utility cart may be used to reduce the risk of spillage. Irradiate cells as described in step 4.\n4. Irradiation with a linear accelerator (LINAC)\nUsing the LINAC's console software, set the accelerator gantry and collimator to 0°, open the X and Y jaws to a symmetrical 20 x 20 cm2 field size and retract the multi-leaf collimators (MLCs) if present.\n\tNOTE: LINACs may have a flattening filter free (FFF) mode, allowing very high dose rates. As the name suggests, this radiation is not uniform (flat), and the high dose rate is only achieved in the center of the beam. In this case a 7 x 7 cm2 field is used.\nPlace at least 5 cm of water equivalent material on the treatment couch. Place the cell dish to be irradiated at 400 MU/min (standard dose rate) onto the water equivalent material and center it at the LINAC crosshairs.",
    "Place the cells to be irradiated at a depth of maximum dose in a 6 MV X-ray beam, around 1.5 cm. Place an additional 1 cm of water equivalent material on top of the dish. Combined with the 1 cm of medium throughout which the cells are suspended, this places the cells at an average depth of 1.5 cm.\nAffix the front pointer to the head of the LINAC. Extend the front pointer until it contacts the surface of the buildup material and note the distance. Adjust the table height until the distance from the source to the buildup surface is 100 cm.\n\tNOTE: The distance can be confirmed with the optical distance indicator. Alternatively, the optical distance indicator may be used in lieu of the front pointer to set the source to buildup surface to 100 cm.\nCalculate the appropriate number of monitor units (MU) to deliver the desired dose of radiation to the cells and program the accelerator to deliver at 400 MU/min.\n\tNOTE: For the source to surface distance (SSD) setup on a LINAC calibrated to deliver 1 cGy/MU at the depth of maximum dose, the required number of monitor units is calculated using MU = Dose(cGy) / (1 cGy/MU) / OF(20x20), where OF stands for output factor. This calculation will have to be altered for LINACs using alternate calibration setups.\nLeave the treatment vault and verify that all other individuals have exited. Vrify that there are no other cells in the room, or they will receive low doses of radiation. Close the vault door.\nConfirm the field size, MU and MU/min at the console and then enable the beam.\nRepeat steps 4.3-4.8 for the cells to be irradiated at higher or lower dose rates.",
    "To achieve higher dose rates (e.g., 2100 MU/min or greater) with the accelerator, decrease the SSD in order to increase the effective dose rate to the cells according to the inverse square law: DoseRateEffective = Doserate * (100 cm / SSD_New)2.\nFor low dose rates (e.g., 20 MU/min), increase the source to surface distance (SSD_New) to decrease the dose rate. For example, the cell culture dish may be placed on the floor of the treatment room.\nRecalculate the monitor unit setting on the accelerator if this setup is necessary, using MU = Dose(cGy) / (1 cGy/MU) / OF(20x20)/ (100 cm / SSD_New)2. For additional information on MU calculations, refer to reference by McDermott and Orton18.\nDetermine dose rate in Gy/minute by DoseRate(Gy/Min) = Dose(Gy)*(MU/min)/MU. e.g., 4 Gy delivered at 400 MU/min requires 380 MU, so 4*400/380 = 4.2 Gy/min.

Biological assays after irradiation\nAfter irradiation, return the cells to the cell culture incubator in the same manner as described above (step 1.9, 2.8 and 3.10).\nAs needed, tailor a variety of biological assays to fit into the research project.",
