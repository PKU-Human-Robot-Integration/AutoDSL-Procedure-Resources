    "Blood samples of healthy donors and heart failure patients were collected at the Policlinic Hospital of Bari (Italy), while samples of BTHS patients were obtained by the National Health Service UK BTHS clinic at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children (UK). Written informed consent of healthy donors, patients, and parents (where appropriate) and approvals by the respective ethics committees were obtained.\nNOTE: If not used immediately, blood (in K-EDTA gel tube) can be stored at 4 °C for up to 24-48 h.\n1. Isolation of leukocytes by dextran sedimentation of red blood cells (RBCs)\nPut blood samples (in K-EDTA) on an orbital shaker for 10 min to mix blood.\nTo 0.9 mL of whole blood in a 1.5 mL tube, add 0.1 mL of 20% dextran solution (molecular mass > 100 kDa, in 0.9% NaCl). Pipette and disperse the suspension gently 20 times while avoiding air bubbles that would otherwise retain RBCs at the top of the tube. Let RBCs sediment for about 1 h at room temperature.\nUsing a syringe, collect and transfer the yellow supernatant to a 15 mL tube, and then centrifuge at 400 x g for 15 min at room temperature (no brake, swing-bucket rotor).\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet containing mainly leukocytes and residual RBCs in 0.6 mL of ice-cold bi-distilled water (ddH2O).\nAfter ~15 s, add 0.2 mL of 0.6 M KCl to the cell suspension to restore the correct osmolarity. The short osmotic shock will lyse RBC and leave leukocytes intact. Adjust the final volume to 2.5 mL with 1x PBS.\nCentrifuge the suspension at 400 x g for 15 min at room temperature (no brake, swing-bucket rotor). Discard the supernatant and wash the leukocyte pellet again with 2.5 mL of 1x PBS.",
    "Centrifuge as in step 1.6 and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the pellet containing leukocytes in 200 µL of sterilized ddH2O.\n\tNOTE: In the authors' experience, this corresponds to a protein content ranging from 200 µg to 400 µg.\nFreeze the suspension at -80 °C or directly perform lipid extraction as follows.\n2. \"Mini-extraction\" of lipids from isolated leukocytes\nTransfer 20 µL of leukocytes suspension (about 20-40 µg proteins) to a 1.5 mL tube and spin at 16,000 x g for 30 s.\nDiscard the supernatant, add 10 µL of CHCl3 to the remaining pellet, and pipette repeatedly to promote lipid extraction.\nFinally, add 10 µL of 9-aminoacridine (9-AA) matrix solution (10 mg/mL 9-AA in 2-propanol/acetonitrile, 60:40 v/v) to the pellet in CHCl3. Pipette and disperse repeatedly to mix.\nSpin the solution containing lipids in CHCl3 and 9-AA at 16,000 x g for 30 s, and then deposit the supernatant as droplets of 0.35 µL (three replicates for each sample) on the MALDI target (sample plate) to be analyzed ('dried droplet' deposition method).\nLet the droplets air dry at least for 10-15 min.\n3. Lipid analysis by MALDI-TOF/MS\nAcquire mass spectra of samples in triplicates on a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer.\nAfter calibration with lipid standards (see Table of Materials), set the analyses in the negative ion mode and optimize the detection m/z range from 200 Th to 2,000 Th for small molecule analysis.\nKeep the laser fluence 5% above the threshold (of CL and MLCL) to have a S/N (at least 2).\nAcquire spectra in reflector mode using delayed pulsed extraction. For each mass spectrum, average 2,000 single laser shots (sum of 4 x 500). Apply gated matrix suppression to 400 Th to prevent detector saturation.\n4. How to calculate the (MLCL + CLi)/CLm ratio",
    "Run the MALDI-TOF/MS instrument software (see Table of Materials) to analyze the acquired spectra.\nUsing the Open command, open the Spectrum Browser dialog that allows selecting and loading the spectrum of interest.\nOn the menu bar, click on the icons Smooth Mass Spectrum and Subtract Mass Spectrum Baseline.\nClick on File > Export > Mass Spectrum and choose the ASCII format for exporting the spectrum as a two-column table with pairs of data points: m/z (x) and intensity (y). Copy and paste the coordinates in a spreadsheet program (*.xls).\nRepeat steps 4.2 to 4.4 for the triplicates of each analyzed sample, pasting the coordinates in the same spreadsheet program file as shown in Figure 1 (Step 1).\nFollowing the x-ranges shown in Figure 1 (Step 2) for each species listed, calculate the sum of y1, y2, and y3 values (triplicates) by the SUM function to get the peak area (Figure 1; Step 3).\nPerform the average of the triplicates area values by AVERAGE function (Figure 1; Step 3).\nPlace the average area values for each species in the column as shown in Figure 1 (Step 2).\nIn order to consider only the first isotopologue of the CLm 72:7 species as in28, calculate the isotopic correction for the overlapping between the M + 2 isotopologue of the CLm 72:8 and the monoisotopic peak of CLm 72:7 as shown in Figure 1 (Step 4).\nFinally, calculate the (MLCL + CLi)/CLm ratio as shown in Figure 1 (Step 5).\nSubscription Required.
