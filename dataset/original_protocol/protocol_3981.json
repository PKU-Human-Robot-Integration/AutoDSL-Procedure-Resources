Because at this stage (E11.5) the mouse cerebellar anlage is very small, it is better to prepare two separate sets of tweezers: one pair of tweezers for the pregnant mice dissection and embryo isolation, the other pair of much finer microsurgical tweezers for further dissection of the required cerebellar regions. Using separate surgical tools could also reduce contamination risk.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/946-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic representation of mouse cerebellar anlage collection steps from E11.5 mouse embryos\nScalebars = 1 inches.\nNote: Pre-cool the dissection medium, and put the medium on ice during cerebellar anlage dissection. Try to finish sample collecting as fast as possible to keep high cell viability.\nSterilize the surgery tools, operation area and dissection microscopes.\nEuthanize one Sox2CreERT2/ Gt(ROSA)26SortdTomtato pregnant mouse by using methods approved by the animal welfare committee.\nNote: Dissection of required cerebellar region needs relatively long time, so euthanize the pregnant mice one by one.\nTake out all the embryos from the pregnant mouse under binocular microscope and put them in cold L15 medium.\nDissect the cerebellar anlage under binocular microscope by using fine microsurgical tweezers and collect the tissues into a 6 cm petri dish filled with cold L15 medium on ice. (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1])\nCritical: There is a transparent vascular membrane on the surface of the cerebellar anlage. If possible, try to remove the vascular membrane by using fine microsurgical tweezers carefully.\nTissue dissociation and cell seeding\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThese steps describe how to digest collected cerebellar anlage tissues into single cells and the details for cell seeding and Rosa-Tomato signal activation.",
    "Once dissection is finished, aspirate all the tissues in 2 mL L15 medium and transfer them to a 15 mL tube.\nAdd 2 mL of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA to the 15 mL tube for digestion.\nIncubate 10 min at room temperature (RT; 15°C–25°C), gently shaking to re-suspend the tissues every 2 min 10 min later, use a p1000 pipet to triturate the tissues by pipetting slowly and gently up and down about 20 times until few tissue clumps are visible.\nCritical: In the process of tissue digestion, check the samples regularly to avoid overdigestion. If it still has some tissue clumps left after pipetting, it means the digestion is inadequate. Put the 15 mL in ice for 5 min to wait to decant the big pieces of tissues, then collect the supernatant to a new 15 mL tube to follow step 8. Add new digestion buffer (2 mL L15 medium + 2 mL 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA) to the original 15 mL tube with precipitate and keep on ice to continue digestion for another 5 min, then repeat step 7.\nAdd 2 mL digestive termination buffer (NBC+FBS+DNAse I) to the 15 mL tube, and dissociate the cells by gently pipetting up and down.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 150 g at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellets in 2–4 mL NBC medium (without phenol red), depending on the size of cell pellets.\nCount the cell number: 25 μL cell resuspension + 25 μL fresh NBC + 50 μL Trypan blue. Slowly mix well, then put 20 μL in a cell counting chamber and count at least 5 squares.\nNote: Calculation: mean of the cell numbers in square × 400 = cell number / μl.\nCell number / μL × cell suspension volume = total cell number.",
    "Seed the cells at a cell density of 2–4 × 105 in pre-coated 24 well plate.\nNote: Because the cells will be cultured for 9–12 days, do not seed the plate with a very high cell density.\nRosa-tomato activation\nTiming: 2–4 h\nAdd tamoxifen to each well directly at a final 5–500 pg/mL concentration (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A–2D).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/946-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. RosaTomato activation in primary cultured cerebellar progenitors\n(A–D) Fluorescence of RosaTomato signals 3 h and 12 days after Tamoxifen adding. Scalebar = 500 μm.\n(E–H′) Fluorescence of RosaTomato signals (E–H) and phase contrast images (E′–H′) 2 weeks after cell proliferation and differentiation. Scalebars = 100 μm.\nCritical: The concentration of tamoxifen depends on the efficiency of Cre activation. Do not use very high tamoxifen concentration, otherwise too many progenitor cells will be labeled with Tomato and it will be hard to distinguish single cell clones (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E–2H′). It is critical to calibrate the concentration to be used in advance.\nIncubate the cells in a 5% CO2 37°C incubator for 2–3 h. Check Rosa-Tomato signals under fluorescence microscope. When sparse Tomato signals could be detected (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2C), begin the time-lapse video recording step.\nTime-lapse video recording\nTiming: 9–12 days\nThis step outlines the procedures of live imaging for cell proliferation and differentiation.\n2–3 h after cell seeding, transfer the 24-well plate to the videomicroscope (Zeiss AxioObserver 7) within a humidified incubator at 37°C with a constant 5% CO2 supply.\nSet up the parameters for cell proliferation stages: time-lapse images for both Cy3 and bright field are acquired every 30 min which lasts for 72 h, by using 10× objective (512∗512 resolution).\nNote: Due to cell movement, it is better to take images for the entire view of each well.",
    "Note: We prepared four wells for time-lapse video recording experiments each time. This results in very large datasets. To avoid crashing during acquisition, stop and immediately restart the acquisition every 24 hours, or more frequently if needed.\nNote: Check the temperature, CO2 concentration and water regularly.\nThree days later, single Tomato+ clones will be formed (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Take out the 24-well plate and change to differentiation medium for Pax6+ granule cells. Use the same parameters to start the program again.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/946-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Live imaging showed that a single Sox2 progenitor cell (Tomato+, Red) could divide several times to generate a cluster\nScalebar = 100 μm.\nAt day 7, take out the plate and change to differentiation medium for Calbindin+ Purkinje cells. Use the same parameters to start the program again.\nNote: After changing to differentiation medium, the position and morphology of each clone will not change as fast as proliferation stages, therefore, in order to reduce the files size, the time interval could be increased. In our study, we used 45 min for Pax6+ granule cells differentiation and 60 min for Calbindin+ Prukinje cells differentiation.\nNote: 7 days after cell proliferation and differentiation, the cell density will be very high, so the differentiation medium should be changed every 2–3 days.\nIdentification of granule neurons and Purkinje neurons\nTiming: 2 days\nHere we describe the procedure for immunofluorescence-based staining to confirm the identity of differentiated granule and Purkinje cells (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nAfter time-lapse video recording, cells were fixed directly by using 4% PFA and incubated for 10 min at room temperature (RT).\nWash 3 × 10 min in 1 × PBS.",
    "Note: To increase the permeability for primary antibody, especially for nuclear expression proteins, the first 10 min of washing should be performed with 1× PBT (1 × PBS containing 0.1% Triton-100) instead of PBS.\nBlock with 10% normal donkey or goat serum in 1 × PBS for 1 h at RT.\nIncubate fixed cells with primary antibodies: Pax6 (1:300, mouse) for granule cells and Calbindin (1:500, rabbit) for Purkinje cells, diluted in 1 × PBS containing 1% normal donkey or goat serum, at 4°C overnight (12–36 h) or 3–4 h at RT.\nWash 3 × 10 min in 1 × PBS.\nIncubate fixed cells with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500) for Calbindin and Alexa Fluor 647 (1:500) for Pax6, diluted in 1 × PBS containing 1% normal donkey or goat serum for 1 h at RT.\nWash 3 × 10 min in 1 × PBS.\nIncubate cells with DAPI (1:2000, Sigma) for 5 min at RT.\nWash 3 × 10 min in 1 × PBS. Then mount cells with Vectashield.\nAfter staining, images were obtained by using confocal microscope (Olympus FV-1200).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/946-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Arrows indicate Calbindin+ / Tomato+ double positive cells and arrow heads indicate Pax6+ / Tomato+ double positive cells. Scalebars=100 μm and 15 μm. Images were taken at the end of 12 days of live imaging.\nData analysis\nTiming: 1 week\nThis step offers time-lapse video recording data analysis and video reconstruction. Because the files are quite large, a super powerful computer should be provided.",
    "Use Zen Pro software to separate the scene of each well to get relatively small files. Perform stitching for each scene to improve the image quality.\nFirst, scan the stitched files day by day to follow the proliferation and differentiation of each single clone. Note the positions of selected clones.\nThen use Image J to open the stitched files. According to written positions, crop the target areas one by one to a consistent size large enough to include the entire cell at the end of differentiation.\nNote: It is quite normal to spend 30–60 min to open one file, so crop and save all the target regions for each file.\nNote: Before cropping, check the size of the target clones that are taken photos on the last day of live imaging to make sure you can crop appropriate areas for the first several days. Because the first 3 days of cell proliferation, the clones are very small, they could grow into quite big clones after several days of cell differentiation.\nUse Image J to open these cropped images and reconstruct videos for each clone. Here are two examples for 12 days time-lapse video recording (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] and S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. 12-day time-lapse video recordings of single Sox2+ cerebellar progenitors generating neuronal clones, related to steps 29–32\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2. 12-day time-lapse video recordings of single Sox2+ cerebellar progenitors generating neuronal clones, related to steps 29–32"
