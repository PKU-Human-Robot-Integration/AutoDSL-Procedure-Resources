    "1. Culture of Pancreatic Cancer 3D Spheroids using Magnetic Bioprinting\nUsing standard aseptic tissue culture technique, culture cells of interest in a T75 flask to a confluency of 70-80% in appropriate growth media.\n\tNOTE: Typically, 5-7 × 106 cells from a 70-80% confluent T75 flask were harvested. Two different cell types were used in this study - Patu8902 (pancreatic tumor cells) and PS1 cells (activated pancreatic stellate cells21). Both cell lines were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute media 1640 (RPMI-1640) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum(FBS), 1× penicillin-streptomycin (p/s).\nWash cells once with 5 mL of Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline(DPBS).\nDetach cells from plastic surface by trypsinizing with 2 mL of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA for 5-10 min at 37 °C. Check for cell detachment under a microscope.\nDeactivate trypsin by addition of 8 mL growth media to detached cells. Avoid over trypsinization, as this can adversely affect the health/viability of cells.\nPipet cells up and down to generate a single cell suspension and count cell density using an automated cell counter or a hemocytometer.\nIn the meantime, equilibrate a vial of NS to ambient temperature.\nCalculate the amount of cells required for seeding the desired number of spheroids (wells) and aliquot to a new 15 mL conical tube. For example, to seed an entire 96 well plate with 5,000 cells/well, aliquot at least 5.5 × 105 cells.\nCollect cells by centrifuging at 500 x g for 3 min. Carefully aspirate or decant the supernatant and resuspend the cells at a concentration of 1.0 x 106 cells/mL in growth media. Pipette gently using a wide bored pipet tip to avoid shearing. For example, resuspend 5.5 x 105 cells in 550 µl of growth media.\nMagnetize the desired amount of cells using the equilibrated NS (step 1.6).",
    "Directly add NS to the cell suspension in growth media and agitate gently. For efficient magnetic labeling of cells, use 10 µL NS per 100 µL cells (resuspended at 1 x 106 cells/mL).\n\t\tNOTE: For a typical experiment, label 5.5×105 Patu8902 cells in 550 µL with 55 µL NS and 1.1×106 PS1 cells in 1100 µL, (separately) with 110 µL NS.\nGently invert tube a few times to ensure cell suspension. Temporarily, transfer the cell-NS mix into a single well of a 24-well plate. Do this separately for each cell type to be magnetized. Cover plate and incubate cells at room temperature for 2 h with gentle shaking to allow NS binding to cell surface.\n\t\tNOTE: Culture and assay of spheroids starting either from Patu8902 or PS1 alone cells, in addition to co-culture spheroids starting with both cell types premixed before printing on magnetic drives was successfully achieved using this method in independent experiments. A method for generating co-culture spheroids from Patu8902 and PS2 cells is described below in the subsequent steps.\nPipet up and down the magnetized cells gently to mix evenly and prepare a master mix containing the desired cell number. For seeding spheroids, use a total of 15,000 cells (5,000 Patu8902 + 10,000 PS1) and adjust to a total volume of 150 µL per well of a 96-well plate.\n\tNOTE: The final volume dispensed into each well must be the same regardless of the number of cells used.",
    "Place a cell repellent 96-well plate atop the 96-well magnetic spheroid drive and dispense 150 µL of cell mix into each well. Observe the cells slowly collect to the center of the well above the magnet. Cover and incubate the plate overnight in a 5% CO2 incubator set at 37 °C with the magnetic spheroid drive still attached. Remove the magnetic drive and incubate for further growth for up to 7 days.\n\tNOTE: It is critical to use cell repellent growth plates for spheroid printing using magnetic spheroid drives. Ensure that the spheroid drive with thinner smaller magnets is used, not the holding drive.\nMonitor the growth of spheroids every day. Replenish with fresh growth media every three days by placing the growth plate mounted on the magnetic holding drive at an angle and using a multichannel pipet to draw out spent media.\n\tNOTE: Patu8902 and PS1 cells co-seeded at 15,000 cells/well will grow into 3D spheroids with a diameter of 400-600 µm within 5-7 days. At this point spheroids are ready for metabolic characterization, drug evaluation, and other downstream applications.\n2. Metabolic Assay of 3D Pancreatic Tumor Spheroids for Bioenergetics Pathways using the Extracellular Flux Analyzer\nNote: In this section, the analysis of the metabolic functions of the spheroids using an extracellular flux analyzer with assay microplates specifically designed for 3D spheroids is described.\nWashing and Transfer of spheroids from growth plates to spheroid assay microplates.\n\tNOTE: Spheroids may be used for metabolic assays when they reach a diameter of ~500 µm.\n\t\nThe day prior to performing the assay, hydrate the probe or sensor cartridge with assay calibrant (200 µL/well) in the provided utility plate and incubate overnight (4-18 h) in a humidified incubator (non-CO2) set at 37 °C.",
    "Prepare the appropriate assay medium for the desired metabolic assay by supplementing the base media (see the Table of Materials) with either 2 mM L-glutamine for glycolysis stress test (GST) assay or with 1 mM pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine and 10 mM glucose for a mitochondrial stress test (MST) assay.\n\t\tNote: The extracellular flux analyzer measures both mitochondrial respiration (OCR) and glycolysis (ECAR) of live cells in a 96-well plate format. These rates provide an overview of cellular metabolic function in samples under investigation. Please refer to the manual in the assay kits for detailed instructions.\nAfter adding assay specific supplements (refer Step 2.1.1), warm the supplemented assay medium in a 37 °C water bath and adjust the pH to 7.4 ± 0.1 with 0.1N NaOH. Keep the medium warm until use.\nReconstitute assay kit reagents in the calibrated assay medium to recommended stock concentrations.\n\t\tNOTE: These are made at 10× the final concentration desired in the wells. Stock concentrations for glucose, oligomycin and 2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG) are 100 mM, 100 µM and 500 mM, respectively.\nObserve spheroids in the growth plate under a light microscope to check for spheroid morphology and overall uniformity; in terms of the shape and structure of the spheroids.\nTransfer the growth plate onto a magnetic holding drive and carefully aspirate ~120 µL growth media. Gently wash spheroids with ~120 µL of warmed and pre-calibrated assay media, aspirate and repeat the wash twice. Inspect the spheroids under the microscope again to ensure that spheroids are not washed away.\nPrepare the spheroid assay microplate by adding 180 µL warm assay media to each well.",
    "Set a P20 micropipette to 10 µL and fit a wide bored tip to it. If wide bored tips are not available, cut off the tips of regular pipette tips with a clean scissors or scalpel to widen the bore.\n\t\tNote: This should reduce shearing and preserve the overall morphology of the spheroids while being transferred to assay plates.\nUse a warm (37 °C) surface to carry out transfer of spheroids. Use an X-ray film viewer surface warmed with a white-light lamp to enhance contrast and aid visualization of spheroids during the transfer process.\nCarefully aspirate a single pre-washed spheroid from the cell repellent growth plate using a P20 micropipette fitted with a wide bore tip and gently transfer spheroid directly into the center of each well of a spheroid assay plate for carrying out the metabolic assay. Allow each spheroid to gently fall into the central micro-chamber of each well by pure gravity to populate the assay plate.\n\t\tNOTE: It usually takes 5-8 s for each spheroid to fall into the center of the well by gravity. Do not pull out the pipette until the spheroids have settled down in the micro-chamber. Do not deposit spheroids in the 4 corner wells of the assay plate (A1, A12, H1, H12) since these will be used as background wells.\nMonitor the morphology and position of each spheroid to ensure that each spheroid is in the center of each well. If necessary, reposition to the center of well by aspirating out spheroid using a wide bore pipet tip, and subsequent deposition by gravity.\nOnce all spheroids have been transferred, place the assay plate in a 37 °C humidified air incubator (non-CO2) for one hour prior to assay.\nLoading sensor cartridge with compounds and performing the assay",
    "Prepare 10× concentrated assay specific reagents in the assay specific media described in step 2.1.2. For example, to carry out GST, reconstitute glucose, oligomycin, and 2-DG in recommended volumes referred to in the assay manual. Both GST and MST assays were carried out using Patu8902-PS1 spheroids.\nProperly orient the sensor cartridge with rows labeled A-H on the left hand side and place a loading guide on top of the sensor cartridge. Ensure correct loading of desired port by orienting the loading guide so that the letter corresponding to the port to be loaded is at the upper left hand corner.\nUsing a multichannel pipette, dispense reagents directly into injection ports. Hold loading guides in position using fingertips throughout the procedure.\n\t\tNote: Each reagent will be injected in a recommended port referred in the assay manual. Avoid creating air bubbles but do not tap any part of the cartridge to remove air bubbles.\nRemove loading guide and position at eye level with cartridge to visually inspect injection ports for even loading.\nCreate the experimental assay design/instrument protocol using the instrument controller Wave software (henceforth, analysis software) as described in section 2.3.\nAssay design and execution using the analysis software\nCreate an assay template for the experiment\nOpen the analysis software and click \"Templates\" or choose from an existing assay template. Double click on \"Blank Template\".\nDefine experimental groups and conditions.\n\t\t\t\nDefine Injection strategies for ports A, B, and C. Leave port D empty.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: For GST assay, only these ports will be loaded with Glucose, Oligomycin and 2-DG. In case of MST assay, oligomycin, FCCP and rotenone will be loaded.\nDefine pre-treatments if spheroids were treated with one or more test compounds and the control group. Define the assay media to include source, supplements, and other information.",
    "Define one or more cell type (e.g. Patu8902, PS1) seeing the density and passage number information.\nClick \"Generate Groups\".\nClick \"Plate Map\" tab and assign groups to the assay plate corresponding to the experimental design.\nSelect the four corner wells as background wells. Ensure that there are no spheroids in these wells.\nRun assay on the analyzer\nClick on the Instrument Protocol tab. Keep the default protocol commands by checking \"Calibrate\", \"Equilibrate\" and \"Baseline Measurement Cycle\".\nClick \"Injections\" and define compound for each port. Edit measurement cycles to 6 cycles from the default 3 cycles for spheroids. Keep the default 3 min mix, 0 min wait, and 3 min measure times.\n\t\tNote: Default mix-wait-measure times are 3 min, 0 min, 3 min, respectively. Three basal rate measurements are typically taken prior to injection of first assay compound. These measurements can be calibrated and readjusted as per the experimental design.\nReview Protocol and Group Summary.\nSave assay design template.\nProceed to pre-assay calibration once injection ports have been loaded with assay substrates. Transfer the cartridge with the utility plate to the extracellular flux analyzer.\n\t\tNOTE: This usually completes within 15-20 min and calibrates the sensors to conduct OCR and ECAR measurements.\nAfter calibration of the cartridge, replace the utility plate with the pre-warmed assay plate containing 3D spheroids and initiate the assay. After the measurements are completed, export the data to spreadsheet or graphing and statistical software to analyze the data."
