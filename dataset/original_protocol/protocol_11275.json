  "procedures": [
    "All of the animal procedures described in this protocol have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use committee (IACUC) at Fox Chase Cancer Center.\nNOTE: The protocol workflow is divided into 4 parts as presented in Figure 1 and the required reagents are listed in the Table of Materials.\n1. Bone Marrow (BM) Isolation\nNOTE: MLL-AF9 leukemia mice were generated as described previously11.\nRecover mono-nuclear bone marrow cells, as described previously12,13,14,15, from wild type C57.Bl6 mice (which express the CD45.2 congenic marker) as well as from C57.Bl6-SJL mice ( which express the CD45.1 congenic marker) that have been transplanted with MLL-AF9-expressing leukemia cells (CD45.2+).\nNOTE: BM can be recovered from mice either by crushing12,13 or by flushing bones14,15. For the experiments presented here, BM was recovered from both healthy and leukemia mice via flushing.\n2. Mitochondrial ROS Fluorogenic Dye Staining\nOnce mono-nuclear bone marrow cells have been recovered from healthy and/or leukemia mice, stain an aliquot of cells with Trypan Blue and count using a hemocytometer to determine the starting number of total BM cells.\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 5 min. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in F-PBS (PBS supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum and a 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin cocktail) to a concentration of 2 x 106 cells/mL.\nAliquot 200 µL of cell suspension per tube into 9 single-color control tubes labeled as follows:\n\tNo stain, B220-Cy5-PE, cKit-Cy7-APC, Sca1-PacBlue, CD150-APC (for healthy HSPCs only), CD45.2-APC (for leukemia cells only), CD34-FITC, Mitochondrial ROS dye and Live/dead cell stain.",
    "NOTE: (Optional) A positive control for the induction of mitochondrial ROS can be prepared by treating 2 x 105 cells in 200 µL with 20 µM of Menadione Sodium Bisulfite (MSB) for 1 h at 37 ˚C in a 5% CO2 incubator. A second control to reverse the MSB-mediated induction of mitochondrial ROS can be prepared by treating 2 x 105 cells in 200 µL with 20 µM of MSB plus 100 µM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) for 1 h at 37 ˚C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nAliquot the remaining cells in a tube (experimental tube) and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min.\nResuspend the cells in F-PBS with a live/dead cell stain according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Incubate on ice for 30 min. Be sure to add live/dead stain to the single-color control tube.\nAdd 1.0 mL of room temperature (RT) F-PBS to both single-color and experimental tubes stained with the live/dead dye. Centrifuge 5 min at 300 x g at RT.\nResuspend 50 µg of the mitochondrial ROS dye in 13 µL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to obtain a 5 mM stock solution.\nDilute mitochondrial ROS dye to a final concentration of 5 µM in RT F-PBS with or without Verapamil (50 µM).\nAspirate off the wash of the live/dead cell stain. Add 200 µL of mitochondrial ROS dye stain containing Verapamil to each experimental tube as well as the mitochondrial ROS dye single-color control tube.\nVortex to mix and incubate for 10 min at 37 ˚C in the dark.\nAdd 1.0 mL of RT F-PBS to the mitochondrial ROS-stained single-color control and experimental tubes. Centrifuge 5 min at 300 x g at RT.",
    "Aspirate off the supernatant and wash the cells with an additional 1.0 mL of RT F-PBS. Centrifuge 5 min at 300 x g at RT.\n3. Lineage Antibody Staining\nPrepare the antibody cocktails listed in Table 1.\nNOTE: These antibodies cocktails have been optimized previously14,15,16.\nAspirate the supernatant from the final mitochondrial ROS dye wash of the experimental tubes containing healthy BM and add 200 µL of antibody cocktail #1 to each tube. Vortex to mix. Also prepare the single-color control tubes. Incubate for 60 min on ice in the dark.\nAspirate the supernatant from the final mitochondrial ROS dye wash of the experimental tubes containing leukemia BM and add 200 µL of the antibody cocktail #2 to each tube. Vortex to mix. Incubate for 60 min on ice in the dark.\nWash with 1.0 mL of cold F-PBS and centrifuge 5 min at 300 x g at RT.\nResuspend cells in 500 µL of cold F-PBS and filter the cells in a flow cytometer tube using a 40 µm filter to exclude aggregates.\n4. Flow Cytometry Acquisition and Analysis\nNOTE: Several hematopoietic stem and progenitor subsets are rare, such as long-term hematopoietic stem cells. Thus, ideally 3-5 million events should be collected for each experimental tube during flow cytometry acquisition for sufficient analysis of mitochondrial ROS in the various HSPC subsets.\nUse the no-stain control tube to set the forward (FSC-A) and side (SSC-A) scatter plots based on the size and complexity of the cell population analyzed.\nUse the no-stain and single-color control tubes to compensate the flow cytometer.\nGate out extraneous debris from the forward and side scatter plot (Figure 2A,B, first panel from the left).\nGate out doublets using a double discriminator such as the forward discriminator (Figure 2A,B, second panel from the left).",
    "Follow the gating strategy proposed in Figure 2A,B to select live cells, lineage low cells and the various HSPC and leukemia subsets.\nFor each population of interest, analyze the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the TRPE channel (x-axis) in a histogram plot to evaluate differences in the mitochondrial ROS signal (Figure 3A-C, left panels). Levels of mitochondrial ROS can be evaluated at the single-cell level by comparing mitochondrial ROS staining versus specific lineage markers in a scatter plot.\nSubscription Required.
