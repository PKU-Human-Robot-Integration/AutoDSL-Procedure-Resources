    "1. In Vitro Kinase Assay for Measuring the Catalytic Activity of RAF Mutants\nConstruct vectors encoding RAF mutants (Figure 1A) with FLAG(DYKDDDDK) tag at C-terminus by using Gibson Assembly or traditional molecular cloning methods.\nIntroduce the FLAG tag and mutations into the RAF coding sequences by PCRs, and then insert whole sequences into pCDNA3.1(+) vector by using Gibson assembly or T4 DNA ligation and following the manufacture’s protocols. Use the following conditions for PCR reactions: (1) 95 °C, 2 min; (2) 95 °C, 30 s; (3) 59 °C, 30 s; (4) 68 °C, 3 min; (5) 20 cycles of (2 to 4); (6) 4 °C hold.\nNOTE: The PCR primers for cloning: 5- AAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCC-3 and 5-CAGCGGGTTTAAACGGGCCCTCTA-3.\nInsert the GST coding sequence upstream of RAF mutant coding sequences to generate vectors encoding GST-fused RAF mutants by using same methods as described in step 1.1.1.\nValidate all vectors by DNA sequencings before transfection.\nPlate 293T cells in 6-well plates at a density of 5 x 105 cells/well one day before transfection. When the cell density reaches 80~90% confluence on the second day, transfect with vectors encoding FLAG-tagged RAF kinases or their mutants from step 1.1 into cells by following the manufacture’s protocol of transfection reagents (Table of Materials).\nReplace the culture medium 24 h after transfection.\nAspirate the culture medium 48 h after transfection and add 400 µL/well of lysis buffer (25 mM Tris·HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.25% NP-40, pH 7.2) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors to lyse cells on ice.",
    "NOTE: The concentration of NP-40 in lysis buffer is critical for detecting the catalytic activity of RAF mutants with moderate dimer affinity/stability in vitro. A high concentration of detergent or a strong detergent in lysis buffer may break RAF dimers and thereby kill the catalytic activity of RAF kinases or their mutants.\nTransfer the cell lysates to a 1.5 mL tube, and spin down by 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C to deplete cell debris.\nTransfer 300 µL per sample of clean whole cell lysates to 1.5 mL tubes, add 20 µL per sample of anti-FLAG affinity beads, and rotate in a cold room (4 °C) for 1 h. Also take 40 µL per sample of clean whole cell lysate aside for detecting the expression and activity (phospho-ERK1/2) of RAF mutants by immunoblots as described below.\nWash the anti-FLAG beads once with lysis buffer, then once with kinase reaction buffer (20 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM Na3VO4, 0.5 mM DTT, pH 7.2), and add 20 µL of kinase reaction mixture (2 μg of MEK1(K97A) and 100 µM ATP in 20 µL of kinase reaction buffer) per sample.\nNOTE: The bead washing should be completed gently and quickly, the residual buffer should be aspirated completely before adding kinase reaction mixture, and all operations at this step should be carried out at 4 °C in a cold room.\nIncubate the kinase reactions at room temperature (25 °C) for 10 min, and flip the tubes containing kinase reactions with fingers every other minute during incubation.\nAdd 5 µL of 5x SDS sample buffer (375 mM Tris·HCl, 9% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 50% Glycerol, 0.03% Bromophenol Blue) per sample to stop kinase reactions, and then heat the samples at 90 °C for 5 min.",
    "Run the samples in 9~12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) with 0.1% SDS, transfer the proteins to nitrocellulose membrane, and detect the levels of phospho-MEK and RAF mutants in samples by immunoblots.\nNOTE: The phospho-MEK can also be quantified by using γ32P-ATP incorporation. Briefly, 10 µM γ32P-ATP is added to the kinase reaction buffer, and the amount of phosphorylated MEK is then quantified after PAGE separation by using standard autoradiography, phosphorimaging, or liquid scintillation counting techniques as appropriate.\n2. RAF Co-activation Assay for Evaluating the Allosteric Activity of Kinase-dead RAF Mutants\nConstruct vectors encoding the RAF receiver (CRAF kinase domain with unphosphorylatable NtA motif, AAFF) or the kinase-dead RAF activators (RAF kinase domain with phosphorylation-mimicked NtA motif, SSDD, DDEE or DGEE) (Figure 1A) as described in step 1.1.\nTransfect 293T cells with two vectors encoding both the RAF receiver and the kinase-dead RAF activator or a single vector encoding one of proteins as described in steps 1.2 and 1.3.\nReplace the culture medium at 24 h after transfection, and harvest 293T transfectants at 48 h to prepare the whole cell lysates as described in steps 1.4 and 1.5.\nMix the clean whole cell lysate with 5x SDS sample buffer quickly at room temperature (25 °C) and then boil at 90 °C for 5 min.\nRun the boiled whole cell lysate samples in 9~12% PAGE with 0.1% SDS, transfer the proteins to nitrocellulose membrane, and detect the levels of phospho-ERK1/2 and control proteins by immunoblots.\n3. Complimentary Split Luciferase Assay for Measuring the Relative Dimer Affinity/Stability of RAF Mutants\nConstruct vectors encoding FLAG-tagged RAF mutants fused to the N-terminus of Nluc (N-terminus of firefly luciferase, aa2-416) or the C-terminus of Cluc (C-terminus of firefly luciferase, aa398-550) as described in step 1.1.",
    "Transfect 293T cells with a pair of vectors encoding different Nluc-RAF mutants and Cluc-RAF mutants as described in step 1.2.\nAt 24 h after transfection, replate 293T cell transfectants into Krystal black image plates at the cell density of 2x105 per well with color-free medium (i.e., DMEM without phenol red).\n24 h later, add D-luciferin (0.2 mg/mL) to 293T cell transfectants, incubate for 30 min, and measure the luciferase signals by using a multi detection system (Table of Materials).\nAfter measuring the luciferase signals, aspirate the medium and lyse 293T transfectants with lysis buffer to prepare the whole cell lysates as described in steps 1.4 and 1.5.\nRun the whole cell lysate samples in 9~12% PAGE with 0.1% SDS and detect the expression levels of Nluc-RAF mutants and Cluc-RAF mutants by anti-FLAG immunoblot as described in step 2.5. The relative expression levels of both Nluc-RAF mutant and Cluc-RAF mutant in 293T transfectants are quantified by using image J from their immunoblots.\nNormalize the luciferase signals of 293T cell transfectants according to the expression levels of Nluc-RAF mutants and Cluc-RAF mutants. Briefly, this is achieved by dividing the raw luciferase signal by the relative expression levels of Nluc-RAF mutants and Cluc-RAF mutants from step 3.6.\nSubscription Required.
