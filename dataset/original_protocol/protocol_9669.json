    "1. Preparation of reagents and buffers\nPrepare 10x Tris-borate EDTA (10x TBE) by adding 0.9 M Tris-base, 0.9 M boric acid, 20 mM EDTA (disodium salt), and deionized water to a final volume of 1 L. Mix until all the components are dissolved.\nPrepare a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide stock solution as follows. In a 250 mL glass bottle, add 120 g of urea (8 M), 25 mL of 10x TBE, 62.5 mL of 40% acrylamide/bisacrylamide (29:1) solution, and enough distilled water to reach the final volume of 250 mL. Mix until all the components are dissolved.\nPrepare 2x loading buffer as follows. In a 50 mL tube, add 21.636 g of urea (8 M), 1.675 g of EDTA (1 mM), and 4.5 mL of 10x TBE. Fill to 45 mL with distilled water and mix until all components are dissolved.\nPrepare the extraction buffer by adding 100 mM sodium acetate and 1 mM EDTA (disodium salt). Set the final pH to 5.\nPrepare ethanol precipitation solutions as follows. Prepare 3 M sodium acetate, adjust to pH 5.2, and store at 4 °C. Prepare 70% ethanol v/v and store at -20 °C. Prepare 100% ethanol and store at -20 °C.\nPrepare 500 mL of SELEX buffer containing 1x PBS, 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 mM CaCl2. Adjust to pH 7.4. Prepare 100 mL of SELEX buffer with 8 M urea by adding 1x PBS, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM CaCl2, and 8 M urea. Adjust to pH 7.4.",
    "NOTE: The choice of SELEX buffer is critical to ensure the selected aptamer will work on the final sample where the aptamer will be applied. For instance, aptamers specific to SARS-CoV-2 will be used in biological samples (e.g., saliva or nasopharynges swabs). Thus, it is important to choose ion concentrations, pH, and buffer that closely mimic those conditions in the intended biological samples.\nPrepare the binding and washing buffer as follows. In a 50 mL tube, prepare 5 mM Tris, 0.5 mM EDTA (disodium salt), and 2 M NaCl. Adjust to pH 7.5.\n2. Design and synthesis of DNA library and primers\nDesign the initial ssDNA library and primers with the following criteria (see Table 1 for an example ssDNA library and set of primers, where N indicates a random nucleotide position).\n\t\nEnsure the library contains a central random region of 35 to 60 nucleotides flanked by two constant sequences at the 3' and 5' ends that act as primer regions for amplification. A typical library length is 45 random nucleotides.\nEnsure the reverse primer contains a biotin modification to separate ssDNA from amplified double stranded PCR products using streptavidin-coated beads during the in vitro selection process.\nPurchase the DNA oligos from commercial sources with standard desalting purification. Purify the ssDNA library and primers by 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (dPAGE), followed by ethanol precipitation according to standard procedures24.\n\tCAUTION: Acrylamide monomer and ethidium bromide are hazardous chemicals (human carcinogens), so use appropriate personal protective equipment (lab coats, gloves, and eye protection) while performing PAGE. When possible, avoid using ethidium bromide and replace it with a safer dye.\n\tNOTE: It is possible to order the oligos with HPLC purification to avoid performing this purification step, though this will not remove short oligonucleotides as effectively.",
    "Add nuclease free water to resuspend ssDNA after ethanol precipitation up to the desired concentration (100 µM). Determine the concentration of the ssDNA library and primers by UV absorption at λ = 260 nm. Store at -20 °C.\nPurchase an unmodified reverse primer to use for high-throughput sequencing library preparation and qPCR quantification.\n3. Infectious and non-infectious virus samples\nCAUTION: The infectious and non-infectious virus samples are biosafety level 2 (BSL2) samples that require extra care to handle safely and appropriately. All steps of the procedure that include these samples must be performed in a biosafety cabinet, or the virus solution must be in a sealed container (e.g., capped plastic tubes).\nObtain a stock solution of infectious viruses or prepare them, following the corresponding protocol for each virus. The SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and H5N1 pseudoviruses used here were provided by Prof. Lijun Rong's lab (UIC) in PBS buffer, and were prepared following the reported protocols22,25,26.\n\tNOTE: For viruses that require biosafety level 3 facilities to handle the intact infectious virus, it is possible to work with pseudoviruses. A pseudotyped virus is generated from a lentivirus (HIV) that displays the surface proteins of the virus within the viral envelope, and thus closely mimics the surface and entry mechanism of the virus but is defective in continuous viral replication.\nObtain a non-infectious virus stock solution or prepare it by following the disinfection procedure. The UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (p-SARS-CoV-2) stock used here was provided by Prof. Rong lab (UIC) in PBS buffer, and the previously reported protocol was used for UV-inactivation22.\n\tNOTE: If possible, perform an assay to test the infectivity of the virus to ensure that the virus has been completely inactivated.\nQuantify the virus stocks",
    "Quantify the virus using a plaque assay according to standard procedures27,28,29. This assay not only allows the quantification of the virus but also indicates the infectivity status of the virus, confirming the concentration of infectious virus.\nFor pseudoviruses or viruses where a plaque assay is not available, quantify the virus using a commercially available quantitative lentivirus ELISA kit.\nPrepare 1 x 108 copies/mL of stock solution for p-SARS-CoV-2, p-SARS-CoV-1, and p-H5N1. Separate each stock solution in aliquots containing 50 µL each and keep at -80 °C. Thaw a new aliquot before each experiment.\n4. In vitro selection or SELEX process: initial round\nNOTE: For all the steps using the infectious virus, work in a BSL2 cabinet.\nDenature the ssDNA library. Take 10 µL of 100 µM of the ssDNA library (1 nmol) and mix with 240 µL of SELEX buffer. Heat at 95 °C for 15 min in a dry bath, and then place the tube on ice for 15 min.\nIncubate the ssDNA library with the infectious virus (positive selection step) as follows. Mix 250 µL of ssDNA library in SELEX buffer from step 4.1 with 50 µL of infectious virus (1 x 108 copies/mL). Incubate for 2 h at room temperature.\nBlock the nonspecific sites in centrifuge filters as follows. While waiting on step 4.2, prepare the centrifuge filters for the next steps.\n\t\nAdd 400 µL of 1 mM T20 sequence (Table 1) to each 0.5 mL centrifuge filter that will be used-one centrifuge filter with a cut-off of 100 kDa and one with a cut-off of 10 kDa.\nIncubate for 30 min at room temperature and centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 10 min to remove the T20 solution in the filter. Wash 3x with SELEX buffer to remove excess T20 sequences.",
    "Wash unbound sequences as follows. Add the mix incubated in step 4.2 to the blocked 100 kDa centrifuge filter and centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 10 min. Wash 3x, adding 400 µL of SELEX buffer and centrifuging at 14,000 x g for 10 min. Keep the fraction in the filter and discard the flow-through.\nElute bound sequences as described below.\n\t\nChange the collection tube of the centrifuge filter and add 300 µL of SELEX buffer containing 8 M urea to the centrifuge filter in step 4.4. Heat the centrifuge filter at 95 °C for 15 min in a dry bath and then centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 10 min.\nCollect the fraction that flowed through the filter containing the eluted sequences. Repeat another three times. Work in a BSL2 cabinet and wash all materials with 10% bleach to inactivate the virus before discarding the materials.\nConcentrate and desalt as follows. Add the solution collected in 4.5 to a blocked 10 kDa centrifuge filter. Centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 15 min. Discard the fraction that flowed through the filter.\n\tNOTE: As the viruses are retained and inactivated with 8 M urea in the filter in the previous step, this and the following steps do not need to be performed in the biosafety cabinet. This procedure needs to be repeated if a 0.5 mL centrifuge tube is used until all the solution is collected as in step 4.5, 1.2 mL flows through the filter.\nWash 3x with 300 µL of SELEX buffer to remove the urea by centrifuging at 14,000 x g for 15 min. Discard the fraction that flowed through the filter. Recover the solution in the filter by turning it upside down in a clean collection tube and centrifuging for 5 min.",
    "Measure the final volume of the recovered solution from 4.7 using a pipette in a plastic tube. This solution is named Ria, where i corresponds to the round number. Typically, volumes between 30 µL to 50 µL are obtained. Take 1 µL of the eluted ssDNA to quantify the amount of DNA by qPCR.\n\tNOTE: This is a possible pause point, where the R1a sample can be kept at −20 °C to continue at another time.\nPerform PCR amplification as described below.\n\t\nIn the first round, take 90% of the R1a sample as a PCR template. In the following rounds, take 60% of the total volume in step 4.8 to perform PCR and store the other fraction at -20 °C.\nSet up a 50 µL PCR reaction with the following having the specified final concentration: 1x PCR reaction buffer, 200 µM dNTPs, 10 µL of DNA template (R1a sample), 200 nM each primer, and 1.25 U polymerase (2.5 U/µL stock).\nOptimize the PCR conditions including number of cycles and annealing temperature for each set of primers and ssDNA library. Avoid using too many cycles, which will produce undesired PCR subproducts such us primer-dimers. Test different annealing temperatures based on the melting temperature of the primers.\nRun the PCR using optimized conditions at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 18 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 30 s at 52 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, with a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min, to obtain the dsDNA pool.\n\t\tNOTE: This is another possible pause point, where the PCR product can be kept at −20 °C to continue at another time.\nRecover ssDNA using streptavidin-modified magnetic beads.\n\t\nTake 80% of the PCR product. Store the remaining fraction at -20 °C.",
    "Split the PCR product in aliquots of 50 µL and add them to microfuge tubes containing 50 µL of streptavidin-modified magnetic beads (MB). Incubate for 30 min with mild agitation (for instance, use a rotating shaker) at room temperature. Then, place the microfuge tube on the magnetic rack to isolate the MB and remove the supernatant by pipetting (it must be a clear solution).\nWash by adding 200 µL of binding and washing buffer to the tube. Remove the tube from the magnetic rack, tap the tube, and resuspend the MB to a homogeneous solution by pipetting. Place the microfuge tube back on the magnetic rack to isolate the MB and remove the supernatant by pipetting. Repeat this washing step twice.\nOnce washing is complete, resuspend the MB in a total of 100 µL of SELEX buffer and heat the solution to 95 °C for 10 min. Immediately place the tube in the magnetic rack before the tube cools down and take the supernatant containing the ssDNA pool. Repeat this recovery step, adding 50 µL of SELEX buffer.\nMeasure the final volume of the recovered fraction from 4.10 using a pipette. This fraction is named Rix, where i corresponds to the round number. In general, volumes between 140 to 150 µL are obtained. Take 1 µL of R1x to quantify the amount of DNA by qPCR.\n5. Subsequent selection rounds\nDenature the ssDNA pool. Take 60% of sample R1x and mix with 50 µL of SELEX buffer. Heat at 95 °C for 15 min in a dry bath. Place the tube on ice for 15 min.",
    "Incubate the ssDNA pool with the non-infectious virus and other potential interfering viruses (counter selection step). Mix the denatured ssDNA pool in SELEX buffer from 5.1 with 50 µL of each virus (5 x 109 copies/mL; e.g., non-infectious p-SARS-CoV-2, p-SARS-CoV-1, and p-H5N1). Incubate for 1 h at room temperature.\nBlock nonspecific sites in centrifuge filters. While waiting on step 5.2., prepare the centrifuge filters for the next steps. Typically, use two centrifuge filters, one with a cut-off of 100 kDa and one with a cut-off of 10 kDa. Follow the same procedure as in 4.3.\nWash away the sequences bound to non-target viruses. Add the mix incubated in step 5.2 to a blocked 100 kDa centrifuge filter. Centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 10 min and recover the fraction that flows through the centrifuge filter. Wash 2x, adding 100 µL of SELEX buffer and centrifuging at 14,000 x g for 10 min. Keep the fraction that flowed through the filter.\nIncubate the ssDNA pool with the infectious virus (positive selection step). Take the 300 µL of fraction from step 5.4 and mix with 50 µL of the infectious virus (1 x 108 copies/mL). Incubate for 2 h at room temperature. Follow steps 4.4 to 4.11.\n6. Monitoring the SELEX process\nNOTE: To monitor the enrichment of the pool, qPCR is used in two ways. First, by absolute quantification, it is possible to test the enrichment of the pools (elution yield). Second, by monitoring the melting curve, the diversity of the pools (convergence of the aptamer species) can be evaluated30.\nPerform all of the qPCR assays with a 10 µL reaction volume in 96-well plates designed for qPCR.",
    "Prepare a standard qPCR mixture containing 5 µL of master mix, 0.3 µL of 500 nM of each unlabeled primer, 3.4 µL of H2O, and 1 µL of DNA template.\n\t\nPrepare dilutions of purified ssDNA library (step 2.3) to run the standard curve.\nDilute the DNA samples to make their concentration fit in the standard curve. For Ria samples, add 1 µL of the sample without dilution and 1 µL of 1:10 dilution to the qPCR mixture. For Rix samples, include 1:10 or 1:100 dilutions.\nRun qPCR by setting the following protocol. First, set an initial denaturation step at 98 °C for 2 min. Then, set 40 cycles of denaturation at 98 °C for 5 s and annealing and extension at 52 °C for 10 s. Finally, set a melting curve analysis from 65 to 95 °C. Determine threshold cycle (Ct) values by automated threshold analysis.\nUsing the standard curve, quantify the amount of ssDNA in Ria and Rix samples.\nCalculate the elution yield as the amount of bound DNA (number of moles in Ria) divided by the amount of initial DNA (number of moles in Ri-1x). Plot the elution yield vs round number to see if an enrichment over the rounds is observed.\nPlot the melting curves for different rounds. A shift to higher melting temperatures in the peak near 75/85 °C is expected as the number of rounds increase. This means the diversity of the pool decreases.\n7. High-throughput sequencing\nConsult with the high-throughput sequencing facility about what sequencing types and scales are available, which will determine the library preparation method.",
    "NOTE: This decision will take into consideration both the length of the pools to be sequenced (including the primers) and the number of pools to be submitted (generally, aim for at least 1 x 105-106 sequences per pool). If a particular sequencing scale cannot read the entire length of the pool, paired-end sequencing can be used to read from both ends of the sequence, as opposed to single-end which reads from only one end.\nSelect an appropriate commercially available kit based on the type of sequencing, in consultation with the sequencing facility. Prepare multiple pools of selection rounds representing high, medium, and low enrichment, as well as the final pool, using a different pair of indexes in the adapters for each pool that allowed the sample analysis of all rounds using one lane.\n\tNOTE: PCR amplification can also be used to incorporate the adapters and indexes required for high-throughput sequencing, but this generally costs similar to the commercial kits and does not perform any better.\n\t\nPerform library preparation by following these steps: end repair of fragmented DNA, adaptor ligation, and PCR amplification to produce the final libraries.\nPurify the PCR product with magnetic DNA clean-up beads following the manufacturer's instruction.\nQuantify the DNA using a fluorescence-based quantification kit. Avoid using less accurate methods, such as small volume UV measurements.\nMix approximately equal amounts (by amount of DNA, not volume) of each pool library containing specific indexes.\nCheck the quality of the final library with qPCR quantification and a DNA fragment analyzer. This step is often performed by the sequencing facility.\n\t\tNOTE: Sequencing facility personnel can provide useful information on how to prepare the library and which quality controls are suggested. Discussing with them is required before preparing the libraries.",
    "Send the prepared final library to the sequencing facility following their requirements.\n8. Sequencing analysis\nMost software available for sequencing analysis is designed to be run on the command-line on a Linux operating system. For small datasets, set up the desired Linux operating system and install required programs on a personal computer; for larger datasets, HTS analysis is run on high-performance computing resources or super computers (recommended).\n\tNOTE: Access and training will be needed to use high-performance computing resources, which may take some time to obtain. Additionally, basic knowledge of UNIX command-line usage will be required. Many free resources on basic command-line usage are available online, and the computing resources will likely provide additional information for using their systems.\nAccess the sequencing files, usually in a compressed FastQ file format, using the information provided by the sequencing facility.\n\t\nUse an FTP client to transfer the files to your own computer and/or the high-performance computing resource. Many sequence analysis programs can directly use compressed files, so keep the files compressed, if possible, to limit their file sizes (large sequence reads of 50 M+ sequences can take up 100 Gb+ of file space when uncompressed).\nIf sequence files need to be uncompressed, use the gzip function which is standard on most Linux installations. Obtain additional information about gzip and its options from the installed manual by typing \"man gzip\" on the command-line.\nClean-up the sequences before analysis by demultiplexing, removing the sequencing adapters, removing low quality reads, and including both forward- and reverse-direction reads.\n\t\nUse the FastQC program31 after each of the following steps to get basic quality control information on the sequences to assess the effectiveness of each clean-up step.",
    "Demultiplex the sequences to separate all sequences from a single read file into the different pools based on the indexes included in the sequencing adapters. This step is often performed by the sequencing facility, who should be consulted as the exact procedure will depend on the sequencing machine used.\nRemove the sequencing adapters using the command-line program, Cutadapt32. Use the selection primers (rather than sequencing adapters) as the input in Linked Adapter mode. Use the --discard-untrimmed option to discard any sequences that do not contain the selection primers.\nSet options for the maximum error rate to match the adapters, and the minimum and maximum length of sequences to accept. If using paired end reads, input specific parameters available and give both the Read 1 and Read 2 sequencing files. Set additional parameters as needed by referring to the Cutadapt manual32.\n\t\tNOTE: The ligation of sequencing adapters to pools is direction independent and will incorporate approximately 50% of sequences in the forward direction and 50% in the reverse direction. To avoid losing the 50% of sequences in the reverse direction, Cutadapt can be run a second time using the reverse-complement of the selection primers as the inputs.\n(Optional) If paired-end sequencing is used, merge the Read 1 and Read 2 files with the program PEAR33.\nUse the FASTX-Toolkit program34 to remove low-quality sequences that have a quality below a certain threshold at any nucleotide. A quality cut-off score of 30 is a good starting point. If the overall quality is generally good, this step can be skipped.",
    "To merge the sequence files in the reverse direction with those in the forward direction, use the FASTX-Toolkit fastx_reverse_complement function on the reverse direction files. Then use the built-in cat program (standard on most Linux installations) to merge the forward and reverse-complement - reverse files into a single file.\nTo analyze the enrichment of sequences across different selection pools, use the FASTAptamer analysis toolkit35.\n\t\nUse FASTAptamer-Count to count the number of times each sequence appears. Then, rank and sort the sequences by abundance. The count output file is required as input for all other FASTAptamer programs.\nUse FASTAptamer-Clust to group all sequences in a file into clusters of closely related sequences. Use the \"distance\" parameter to define the number of single nucleotide mutations or indels allowed to group into a cluster.\n\t\tNOTE: The FASTAptamer-Clust program can be very computationally expensive if a high number of unique sequences are present (especially for early rounds), which could take days or even weeks to fully complete. The cut-off filter parameter can be used to exclude low abundance sequences from clustering. Generally, it is good to start with a higher cut-off, such as 10 or 5 reads per million (RPM) and decrease it if the program finishes quickly. If the pools are very heterogenous, it may not be feasible to cluster the sequences in a reasonable timeframe.\nUse FASTAptamer-Enrich to calculate the enrichment of each sequence present in more than one round of the selection. Compare the RPM of the sequence from one population with the RPM in another. Use the Enrich program on either the Count or Cluster files. The output is a tab-separated-value (.tsv) file that can be opened in any spreadsheet software for further analysis and easy sorting.",
    "NOTE: The FASTAptamer-Enrich program can also be very computationally expensive if a high number of unique sequences are present. The cut-off filter parameter can be used to exclude low abundance sequences from the output to avoid files that are too big to open in spreadsheet software.\n(Optional) If many pools are too heterogenous (many unique sequences and few duplicate sequences), it may not be feasible to use either the Clust or Enrich programs. In this case, perform a manual enrichment check using the Count output file which sorts sequences by abundance (most abundant the at top) and renames the sequence identifier to include important information such as RPM.\n\t\t\nUse the standard Linux \"head\" program on the Count files to get a list of the most abundant sequences. Then use the standard Linux \"grep\" program to search each of the most abundant sequences in the Count files of all of the other relevant pools. If there are any matches, use the modified sequence identifier to determine the RPM in that pool, to manually construct the enrichment information.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Scripts for all the sequencing analysis steps can be found in the Supplementary Coding Files 1-11.\n9. Aptamer binding validation and assays\nFrom the enrichment information obtained through sequence analysis, identify candidate aptamer sequences based on sequences that have the most enrichment over subsequent selection rounds and/or the most abundant sequences in the final selection round. Select several different candidate sequences (at least 10-20) for further testing as the most highly enriched may not necessarily be the best performing aptamers.\nPerform initial screening of candidate aptamers using a binding assay that can be performed quickly for multiple samples. A column-based ultrafiltration binding assay36 or enzyme-linked oligonucleotide assay (ELONA) are good methods for this initial screening.",
    "Analyze the specificity and affinity of the sequences that show the best binding activity from the initial screening, using at least two independent binding assays (e.g., MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST)37,38, Enzyme-Linked Oligonucleotide Assay (ELONA)39, surface plasmon resonance40, or biolayer interferometry (BLI)41).\nSubscription Required.
