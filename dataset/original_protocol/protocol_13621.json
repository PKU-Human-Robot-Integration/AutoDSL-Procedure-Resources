    "The procedures indicated in this protocol are in accordance with the review board of Massachusetts General Hospital. The blood samples that were used had been collected during a previous study and were de-identified for the current purpose18.\nNOTE: See manufacturer's instructions for specific guidance regarding optimal connections between tubing and glassware constituting the purge vessel, washing, and general maintenance. Connections need to be firm and carefully made not to damage the glassware. Identify the components of the glass purge vessel: gas inlet line, purge vessel with heating jacket and condenser, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) gas bubbler trap, connection line between the purge vessel and the bubbler, purge vessel outlet gas line (to CLD) endowed with an intense field dielectric (IFD) filter. An IFD filter line between the purge vessel and the sample inlet of the CLD must be in place every time NO metabolites in liquid form (plasma, cell cultures, tissue homogenates) are measured (all the assays presented in the protocol). Sample preparation depends on the fluid or tissue that is analyzed and on the compounds of interest. Important aspects of the preanalytical phase are covered in section 1 and 2. Specific preparation steps for specific assays are included in sections 3-5. Sections 6-8 apply to all assays.\n1. Preparation of dedicated reagents\nNOTE: For more details, refer to previous publications15,22.\nPrepare 5% (290 mM) acidified sulfanilamide (AS) solution for NO2- removal by dissolving 500 mg of sulfanilamide into 10 mL of 1N HCl. This solution is stable for months.\nPrepare 50 mM mercuric chloride (HgCl2) solution for NO2- release from S-NOs by dissolving 67.9 mg of HgCl2 into 5 mL of PBS.

    "Prepare NO2- blocking solution with 800 mM ferricyanide [K3Fe(CN)6] to oxidize Hb together with 100 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) to block thiol-groups and (OPTIONAL) 10% nonylphenyl-polyethylene glycol solution (Nonidet p-40) to solubilize red cell membranes.\n\t\nAdd K3Fe(CN)6 to deionized and distilled water (ddH2O, 263.5 g of powder per liter) to obtain a final concentration of 800 mM.\nAdd NEM to the 800 mM K3Fe(CN)6 in ddH2O solution (12.5 g of powder per liter to have 100 mM concentration) and mix the solution to dissolve all crystals.\nAdd one part of 10% NP-40 to nine parts of the 800 mM NEM K3Fe(CN)6 100 mM NEM solution (111 mL per liter) and mix well (mandatory step for whole blood analysis).\nPrepare the S-NO-Hb stabilization solution containing 12 mM K3Fe(CN)6, 10 mM NEM, 100 µM diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA, for metal chelation), and 1% Nonidet p-40 detergent from their stock solutions.\n\t\nPrepare a 200 mM NEM solution by adding NEM crystals to PBS (25 mg/mL, e.g., 250 mg in 10 mL PBS) and mix the solution until all crystals are dissolved (to be made on experiment day).\nPrepare a 800 mM K3Fe(CN)6 solution by adding K3Fe(CN)6 to ddH2O (263.5 mg/mL e.g. 1.32 g in 5 mL of ddH2O to obtain final concentration of 800 mM) (to be made on experiment day).\nPrepare a 10 mM DTPA stock solution by adding 786 mg of DTPA to 200 mL of ddH2O and adjust pH to 7.0 with 5N NaOH to fully solubilize DTPA.\nAdd 5 mL of 200 mM NEM solution, 1.5 mL of 800 mM K3Fe(CN)6 solution and 1 mL of DTPA stock solution to 81.5 mL of PBS at 7.2 pH, and finally, add 11 mL of 10% NP-40 at last to bring final volume to 100 mL.\n2. Sample collection",
    "NOTE: For more details on sample collection, refer to previously published works15,22,40.\nCollect whole blood\n\t\nCollect blood in heparin-coated tubes preferring venous over arterial vessel (unless specifically required) and preferring catheter placement over venipuncture (if possible) with catheter or needle bore of at least 20 G or larger to minimize hemolysis.\nImmediately add the NO2- blocking solution (1 part of the solution to 4 parts of whole blood), process (sections 3 or 4), or freeze and store at -80 °C.\nCollect plasma and red blood cells (RBCs)\n\t\nCollect blood in heparin-coated tubes preferring venous over arterial blood (unless specifically required) and needles of at least 20 G or larger to minimize hemolysis and centrifuge immediately for 5 min at 4000 x g at 4 °C.\nMix the supernatant (plasma) with the NO2- blocking solution (1 part of the solution to 4 parts of the supernatant) in a new tube and process (sections 3 or 4), or freeze and store at -80 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: For the NO consumption assay, the NO2- blocking solution cannot be used. The assay can be performed without plasma pre-treatment.\nResuspend the RBC pellet from the bottom to a new tube pre-filled with S-NO stabilization solution (see step 1.4) (1 mL of pellet to 9 mL of solution) and incubate for 5 min.\nPass the RBC lysate in a sizing column with G-25 Sephadex polymer that has been previously rinsed with ddH2O for exclusion chromatography\nCollect the Hb fraction to process (section 4) and to measure Hb concentration using Drabkin's reagent (for Hb measurement, refer to previously published work22).",
    "NOTE: To prepare and sample a specific tissue/organ, identify its hilum, and surgically isolate it. Incise the vein, puncture the artery, and inject with heparinized saline (10 U/mL) via the artery. Excise the tissue when saline starts to backflow at the venous incision. Homogenize the tissue with a mechanic homogenizer while adding 1 part of NO2- blocking solution to 4 parts of homogenized tissue.\n3. VCl3 in HCl assay preparation\nNOTE: For more details on VCl3 in HCl assay preparation, refer to previously published works37,41.\nCAUTION: The CLD will be damaged if the NaOH trap is not properly in place when performing this assay. This is due to the corrosivity of HCl.\nPrepare standard solutions of NO3- for standard curve\n\t\nDissolve 85 mg of NaNO3 in 10 mL of ddH2O to obtain 0.1 M NaNO3- (this solution remains stable for a few weeks).\nUse the stock solution to prepare standards by dilution in ddH2O to obtain concentrations of 5 µM, 10 µM, 20 µM, 40 µM, 80 µM, 200 µM NaNO3 in order to perform a calibration curve for plasma or urine samples (use lower concentrations if working with cell cultures).\nPrepare VCl3 (vanadium chloride) saturated solution for NO3-​ reduction in the purge vessel\n\tCAUTION: The reaction of water and VCl3 is exothermic. Pay attention to high glassware temperature when adding acid and when rinsing the glassware at the end of the experiment.\n\t\nDissolve 1.6 g of VCl3 in 200 mL of 1 M HCl by first adding VCl3 in a clean flask then adding 200 mL of 1 M HCl.\nVacuum filter the solution through filter paper (such as 11 μm filter paper, but any filter paper can be used).",
    "NOTE: The filtered solution shall turn to clear blue, while the unfiltered VCl3 solution is brown because of undissolved particles.\nKeep the saturated solution covered with either aluminum foil or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tape as the compound is light sensitive.\nPrepare the circulating water bath\n\t\nConnect a circulating water bath device to the water jacket of the purge vessel. Make sure that the lines are dry before priming.\nStart the water bath at 95 °C and verify the absence of leaks on the water lines by applying (nonadherent) paper towels around the lines.\nSet up the gas bubbler trap\n\t\nVerify that the PTFE sleeve of the bubbler is in place and that it is not damaged.\nOpen the gas bubbler and inject 15 mL of 1 M NaOH into the bubbler base.\nReposition the gas bubbler and seal the connection tightly by pressing the bottom towards the top and slightly twisting the two parts. The impossibility of turning the top of the bubbler without applying force indicates a correct seal.\nConnect the outlet of the purge vessel to the inlet of the gas bubbler trap.\n4. I3- in acetic acid assay preparation\nNOTE: For more details on I3- in acetic acid assay preparation, refer to previously published works15,22,38,41,42.\nPrepare standard curve for NO2-\nPrepare a stock solution by dissolving 69 mg of sodium nitrite (NaNO2) in 10 mL of ddH2O to obtain 100 mM solution. This solution is stable if stored in an airtight container, refrigerated, and protected from light.",
    "Serially dilute the stock solution into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube pre-filled with 900 μL of ddH2O: Add 100 μL of the stock solution to the first centrifuge tube, mix, label, and use 100 μL of the tube for the second tube, then repeat resulting in 10 mM, 1 mM, then 100 μM.\nFurther dilute with ddH2O to obtain 50 μM, 25 μM, 10 μM, 1 μM and 500 nM NaNO2 aliquots to be used in the calibration curve.\nPrepare the I3- in acetic acid for the purge vessel (can be stored at room temperature (RT) for 1 week)22\nAdd 2 g of potassium iodide (KI) and 1.3 g of iodine (I2) to 40 mL of ddH2O and 140 mL of acetic acid.\nMix thoroughly by stirring the mixture for at least 30 min.\nPrepare the samples for differential determination of NO2-, S-nitrosothiols (S-NO-Hb, if Hb is collected) and iron-nitrosyl complexes (Hb-NO if Hb is collected) (Figure 3)\n\t\nDivide each sample in 3 aliquots of 270 μL (900 μL of Hb if measuring S-NO-Hb and Hb-NO) in light-protected microcentrifuge tubes, 2 of them pre-filled with 30 μL of 1x PBS (100 μL if measuring S-NO-Hb and Hb-NO) and the third tube with 30 μL of HgCl2 (100 μL if measuring S-NO-Hb and Hb-NO), vortex and incubate at RT for 2 min (Figure 3).\nAdd 30 μL of 5% AS to the sample with HgCl2 to measure Fe-NOs, (100 μL for Hb-NO) and to one with added PBS to measure S-NOs and Fe-NOs (100 μL for S-NO-Hb and Hb-NO) and add 30 μL of PBS to the third one already pre-filled with 1x PBS to measure NO2-, S-NOs and Fe-NOs (100 μL for residual NO2- from Hb collection, S-NO and Hb-NO). Vortex and incubate at RT for 3 min (Figure 3).",
    "5. NO consumption by cell-free Hb setup\nNOTE: For more details, refer to the previously published work38.\nPrepare standard oxyHb solutions from a purified stock Hb solution with a known concentration\n\t\nSerially dilute the stock solution into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes by addition of ddH2O to obtain the solutions that will be used for the calibration curve: 62 μM, 50 μM, 25 μM, 12.5 μM, 6.25 μM, 3.125 μM, 1.56 μM.\nPrepare the DETA-NONOate solution\n\t\nAdd 10 mg of DETA-NONOate to 610 µL of 10 µM NaOH in pH 7.4 PBS to generate 100 mM of DETA-NONOate and keep it on ice.\n6. Start the chemiluminescence detector (CLD) and prepare the purge vessel\nNOTE: For the preparation of the purge vessel, refer to the previously published work43.\nVerify the main connections to and from the CLD\n\t\nConnect the oxygen line to the CLD and open the oxygen tank at a pressure that is in agreement with the CLD's manufacturer.\nMake sure that the Intense Field Dielectric (IFD) filter line is connected to the CLD but not to the purge vessel or the NaOH trap\nStart the CLD\n\t\nOn the CLD interface, start running the detection program for liquid phase assays.\nVerify that the oxygen supply is adequate. If this is the case, the CLD will successfully start sampling from its inlet and indicate detection by a signal in millivolts (0-5 mV). Otherwise, the CLD will prompt a negative diagnostic signal.\nPrepare the purge vessel\n\t\nClose the purge vessel on all three ports: fully screw the needle valve to the right, close the inlet and outlet stopcocks.",
    "Remove the cap from the purge vessel and add a sufficient quantity of the reagent specific to the planned assay to the reaction chamber (Table 1) so that the syringe needle used to inject the samples can reach the fluid column.\nVerify the presence of a stable desired baseline (Table 1).\nStart the purge gas flow\n\t\nEnsure that the inert gas tank (e.g., N2) is equipped with a two-stage regulator and connect the inert gas tank with the gas inlet of the vessel.\nOpen the gas with an outlet pressure at the regulator of 1-5 psi, open the inlet of the purge vessel and slowly open the needle valve of the purge vessel to allow inflow of gas. Verify bubbling within the purge vessel.\nAdjust the gas flow\n\t\nRecord the cell pressure measured by the CLD with the IFD filter line sampling ambient air.\nReposition the cap on the purge vessel, connect the IFD filter line to the purge vessel (or to the NaOH trap in the VCl3 in HCl assay), and open the outlet of the purge vessel.\nUse the needle valve to reach the same cell pressure at the CLD level that is recorded in ambient air.\n7. Experiment\nNOTE: For more details regarding the experiment, refer to the previously published work43.\nStart the chemiluminescence signal acquisition program\n\t\nConnect the serial port of the CLD to the computer's serial port into which the acquisition program has been installed.\nRun the analysis program.\nClick on Acquire, select the folder to save the .data file, type in the file name, and click on Save.\n\t\tNOTE: Notice the preset run time on screen, as the recording stops automatically when the preset time elapses. If needed, the preset running time can be increased.\nPrepare for repeated sample injections",
    "Adjust the voltage scale on the screen to have control over the targeted baseline by clicking on the Minimum and/or Maximum buttons and then entering the desired value.\nHave a 20- or 50-mL tube filled with ddH2O to rinse the syringe between samples.\nHave a box of delicate task wipes readily available.\nSample injection\n\tNOTE: Start from the standard solutions for the calibration curve (inject from the least concentrated to the most concentrated samples), then proceed to the experiment samples (consider doing so in duplicates or triplicates).\n\t\nRinse the syringe at least twice or more with ddH2O before withdrawing each sample (and after each injection) and verify every time unobstructed water ejection on a task wipe.\nInsert the syringe in the sample tube while holding both the syringe and the tube at a close distance, pull up the plunger to the desired volume while ensuring no air bubble and/or non-homogenized solid parts are trapped.\nClean the tip of the syringe with a task wiper, then insert the syringe into the septa cap at the injection port and inject after verifying that the tip of the syringe is within the liquid phase in the reaction chamber.\nMark the injection in the software program and wait\n\t\nVerify that the injection causes an upwards change in the signal (Supplemental Figure 1) (downwards in the NO consumption by cell-free Hb assay) and type the sample name by clicking the grey box under Sample Names, then click on Mark Injection.\n\t\tNOTE: Suspect syringe obstruction if the sample injection does not generate a signal.\nWait for the electric signal to reach baseline again (this usually takes 3-4 min). This time can be used to perform step 7.3.1.",
    "Repeat all steps indicated in steps 7.3 and 7.4 during and after every injection until the end of the experiment. Remember to run a sample of the preservation solution (if used)\nStop the experiment\n\t\nClick on STOP to interrupt the signal acquisition, stop the CLD and turn off the water bath (if NO3- is measured).\nInterrupt the gas flow, open the needle valve, remove the cap from the purge vessel, place a waste container under the drain and open the draining stopcock.\n\t\t​NOTE: If the experiment requires data acquisition for longer than 60 min, it is necessary to restart the acquisition after 60 min of running time (repeat step 7.1.3) and make a new file.\n8. Measurements and calculations\nNOTE: Measurements and calculations are made offline and can be performed at a different time.\nStart the chemiluminescence acquisition program for offline data analysis\n\t\nStart the program and click on Process.\nSelect the experiment file, then click on Open.\nCalculate the area under the curve for each administration\n\t\nThe software automatically graphs on screen the baseline (Supplemental Figure 2A, horizontal yellow line) and the peak axis of each wave generated by each sample administration (vertical yellow lines): verify their correct position (or adjust by clicking on each line and moving it with the mouse or the arrows) and click on Threshold OK (Supplemental Figure 2B).\n\t\tNOTE: In the NO consumption by cell-free Hb measurement assay, the software does not typically manage to correctly capture the waveform generated by sample injection. By zooming on each waveform, the operator can easily assist the software in the area calculation (Supplemental Figure 2).",
    "The software automatically graphs the beginning (vertical green line) and the end (vertical red line) of each peak caused by each sample administration: verify their correct position (or adjust by clicking on each line and moving it with the mouse or the arrows) and click on Integrate (Supplemental Figure 2C).\n\t\tNOTE: Some areas in the trace may be mistakenly defined as injections at this point, and some peaks may be automatically counted twice. Both mistakes can be re-identified and removed during step 8.2.2\nThe software automatically matches every signal area following an injection marked during the experiment and its assigned name: navigate each peak (indicated by a yellow vertical line) with the assigned name by clicking on Next Peak and Previous Peak, then click on the button All OK to finally obtain the calculation for all areas on the screen.\nIn order to correct all naming or matching mistakes made by the user or by the program, use as needed the buttons indicated in Supplemental File 1.\nTransfer the calibration curve values to a spreadsheet and generate a linear regression equation (Supplemental Figure 3)\n\t\nTransfer the data from the CLD program to a new spreadsheet through copy-paste. Arrange the two columns on the datasheet as Sample Concentration and Area Under the Curve, and add a matched value of zero on both columns.\nSelect the two columns, click on Insert > Scatter, then under the Chart Design menu, select Add Chart Element > Trendline > Linear.\nRight-click on the generated trendline, click on Format Trendline, then click the options Display Equations on Chart and Display R-squared value on Chart on the Format Trendline menu to obtain a simple linear calibration equation.\nTransfer the calculated area of each sample to calculate its concentration (Supplemental Figure 3)",
    "Report every value on the spreadsheet. In the next column, apply the equation obtained from step 8.3.3 to obtain the concentration of each injected sample, where y is the concentration (value of the new column) and x is the area under the curve measured after injection.\n\t\tNOTE: Remember to take into account the concentration measured in the preservation solution (if used) and subtract the values accordingly.\nSubscription Required.
