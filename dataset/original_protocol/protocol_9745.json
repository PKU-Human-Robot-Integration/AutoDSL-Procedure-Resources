    "The protocol was completed in a manner corresponding to the best ethical practices of the author's institution including the proper handling of any patient information and the assurance of the required consents necessary to use patient specific data. When used, such data was anonymized to ensure the protection of the patient's private health information.\nNOTE: The following protocol is written in a software neutral manner, as there are many different programs that can accomplish the various steps. For this particular case, Materialise Mimics Medical 24.0 was used for segmentation, and Materialise Magics was used for 3D manipulation and creation of the segmented models and cases. Specific instructions for those programs will be included in addition to the generalized approach.\n1. Segment patient anatomy\nPer SME, obtain a patient radiologic imaging dataset, typically a CT or MRI, acquired using a 3D protocol for adequate resolution. Open dataset in a computer aided design (CAD) segmentation software23.\n\t\nRefer to the institution's radiology protocols for proper image acquisition (since each patient requires different considerations, it is difficult to provide a specific guideline). But as a representative example, these are the settings we used in a previously documented 3D model case: CT 3D protocol suggests parameters: slice scanner in axial mode, slice thickness and space between slices of 0.625 mm, Kv of 70, Smart mA range of 201-227 (smart MA mode 226), rotation speed at 0.28 ms. MRI 3D protocol suggested parameters: slice scanner in axial mode, slice thickness and space between slices of 0.625 mm.",
    "Generate an initial segmentation of the myocardial tissue using a Hounsfield unit (HU) threshold tool with upper and lower limits set to values that are appropriate and specific to the dataset. Refine the selection as needed to accurately capture the anatomy. It is recommended to use tools with the following capabilities: crop, add and subtract, region grow, multi-slice edit, and cavity fill. In Mimics, right click in the Project Manager area and select New Mask. Adjust the mask in the generated dialogue box either with the pre-set anatomical windows provided, exact HU measurements, or by sliding the provided tool until the anatomy desired is masked by the tool.\nGenerate a segmentation of the blood pool. Utilize the steps described in step 1.2 to accomplish this. In Mimics, use the pre-set anatomical HU window of 226 to 3071 to capture the blood pool.\nIf the model being generated is intended for use in patient care, let a cardiologist, radiologist, or other subject matter expert (SME) review the virtual model segmentations before proceeding to the next step to ensure all anatomic features and defects were segmented accurately and will be present in the complete model.\nGenerate a myocardial case model by inverting the myocardium segmentation using a cavity fill tool in the empty space around myocardium segmentation and subtracting the blood pool segmentation from the inverted myocardium using a Boolean subtract tool. It is recommended to use a cavity fill tool, a Boolean tool, and the previously generated myocardium and blood pool segmentations to accomplish this. In Mimics, Cavity Fill > Indicate spaces around myocardium mask. Next, use the Boolean tool and fill the provided dialogue to Minus the blood pool mask from the myocardium mask.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62805/62805fig01.jpg",

Per SME suggestion and approval, remove any blood vessels from the 3D blood pool model that are not necessary for evaluation, comprehension, or repair of the target anatomy. In Mimics, select 3D Preview in the options next to the viewing window (defaulted to the bottom right view of the four-pane default view. Select the mask of interest in the Project Manager. To edit, select the Edit Mask tool. In the provided dialogue, select the Lasso tool and ensure that Remove is selected. This will allow editing of the actual 3D Preview of the mask.\n\tNOTE: The editing tool is an infinite cut plane and will remove any part of the mask selected in the Z-direction.\nGenerate 3D objects of the final blood pool and myocardial case segmentations. Smooth the 3D myocardial case model using a smooth object tool. Per SME suggestion and approval, adjust iteration and smooth factor parameters as necessary for the specific model to create a case model that is as smooth as possible but has not lost any important anatomical details.\nOnce approved by an SME, export the models in STL format for use in a 3D model editing software. In Mimics, right-click on a specific mask in the Project Manager > Create Object. In the provided dialogue, ensure the Optimal setting is selected and click Okay.",
    "Once the model is created, it will appear in the Object window, typically below the Project Manager window. From there, right-click on a generated model and select Smooth. Parameters for this case were five iterations at 0.4 mm smoothing.\nSave/export the final 3D blood pool and myocardial case models as standard tessellation language (STL) files. Right-click the desired model > STL+ > follow the provided dialogue to export an STL version of the model.\n2. Create the digital molds\nOpen the myocardial case model STL file in a CAD program. It is recommended to render the visibility of the case in a transparent manner to allow the myocardium to be visible on the interior of the myocardial case mold. In Magics, import the STLs generated through Import Part. In the Project Management window, select the Transparent option of model rendering.\nTrim excess myocardial case material from the model using a cut or punch tool. It is only necessary to have approximately 0.5 cm between the outer edge of the case and the myocardial imprint on the inner case wall. Additional material will add to the time needed to 3D print but will not affect the end product. In Magics, Cut > Indicate Polyline > select points of interest > Apply.\n\tNOTE: The editing tool is an infinite cut plane and will remove any part of the mask selected in the Z-direction.\nCut the myocardial case into multiple pieces that will allow the case to be assembled around the complex anatomy of the blood pool mold. It is recommended to use a cut and/or punch tool to accomplish this.",
    "NOTE: The following steps provide a suggestion of cuts to make in the myocardial case that will divide it into four sections that have been found to be sufficient for both diagnostic accuracy and case assembly around the blood pool for many cardiac models. However, each model will be different, making it vital to keep in mind that the case must be assembled around the blood pool before silicone is poured and removed after the silicone sets. Pay special attention to any locations where the case must pass through a loop in the blood pool or surround long blood vessels. Features such as these may require the myocardial case to be cut into additional pieces in the region where the feature exists to ensure assembly and disassembly around the blood pool will be possible.\nAdjust the view of the myocardial case through rotation and panning tools to point the apex of the heart down and the aorta arch horizontal. Make a horizontal cut through the aorta that divides the myocardial case into a lower half that contains the apex and an upper half. Length of this cut and all subsequent cuts will vary with each cardiac model. In Magics, use the left and right mouse buttons to control rotation and panning, respectively. From there, Cut > Indicate Polyline > select points of interest > Apply.\n\tNOTE: The editing tool is an infinite cut plane and will remove any part of the mask selected in the Z-direction.\n\t\nMake a vertical cut along the widest section of the lower half of the myocardial case. Ensure that the lower half of the myocardial case is split roughly in half.",
    "Make a second vertical cut along the widest section of the upper half of the myocardial case. Ensure that the upper half of the myocardial case is split roughly in half.\nAdd pegs (props) to the myocardial case pieces to ensure proper alignment during assembly. It is recommended to use a prop generation tool and a Boolean subtraction tool with a clearance value of 0.25mm to create matching props and prop cavities. In Magics, Add Props > indicate position on model > Apply.\nCreate a 1.0 cm diameter silicone fill hole to one of the myocardial case upper half pieces. The myocardial surface features directly below the fill hole will be obscured, so ensure that the fill hole is not over any external anatomical features that will be vital to the use of the model. Verify hole placement with a SME.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62805/62805fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Myocardial case model in a CAD software.

Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62805/62805fig02large.jpg]\nCheck diagnostics on all case pieces individually to ensure the following errors are not present: inverted normal, bad edges, bad contours, near bad edges, planar holes, or shells. If an error is detected, repair it using a fixing tool/wizard if available or manually if not available. In Magics, Check Diagnostics > Auto-resolve.\nFix errors that cannot be resolved manually or with a fixing tool/wizard with a part shrink wrap via a shrink wrap tool. Adjust shrink wrap sample interval and gap fill values as necessary to correct the errors on the specific piece without altering the physiology upon SME review. In Magics, Fix > Shrink Wrap > follow dialogue.\nSave/export the individual myocardial case pieces as STL files.\n3. Create the physical molds",
    "Open the myocardial case and blood pool models in the appropriate slicer software to produce 3D printing files (G-Code file) for an additive manufacturing (AM) 3D printer. Arrange the pieces of the myocardial case using a rotate and/or lay flat tool, so any side that will meet up with another case piece is vertical. Add 3D print supports to all pieces manually or using an automatic support generation tool provided in the software, if available.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62805/62805fig03.jpg\nFigure 3: Myocardial case and blood pool setup in a 3D printing CAD software.

    "Upload the printing file to the 3D printer using a Flash Drive or Wi-fi connection, depending on the printer's capabilities, ensure correct filament is loaded onto 3D printer and start print. The 3D printer should meet the following requirements: compatible and equipped with a nozzle diameter less than 0.4 mm and capable of a layer resolution less than 0.25 mm. Upon completion of printing, use needle nose pliers and tweezers to remove all support material from the printed pieces.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62805/62805fig04.jpg\nFigure 4: 3D printed model pieces.

Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62805/62805fig04large.jpg]\nAssemble the myocardial case pieces around the blood pool mold, ensuring all pieces fit together tightly. If the myocardial case cannot fit around the blood pool, make small adjustments to the case mold piece using a handheld rotary sanding tool to remove material. If a large adjustment is needed, it may be necessary to edit the STL file in a CAD software and create a new 3D print.\n\tCAUTION: Use eye protection when using a handheld rotary sanding tool. Use of a rotary sanding tool on the blood pool or myocardium case will cause the plastic to melt. Use sparingly and with caution.\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused between any steps prior to this point.\nPerform an acetone vapor smooth if the myocardial case was 3D printed using ABS, and a smoother silicone surface finish is desired by the SME. If a smoother surface finish is not desired or needed, skip the vapor smooth process with minimal effect to the final anatomy of the model.",
    "CAUTION: Acetone is volatile and flammable. Be sure to set up in a well-ventilated area away from open flames or sparks. Additionally, acetone will dissolve polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polystyrene. If a plastic container is being used, ensure it does not contain PVC or polystyrene.\n\t\nLine the bottom and sides of a container that will not be affected by acetone with paper towels. Pour the acetone on the bottom paper towel and allow it to diffuse up the paper towels on the side of the container but not form a pool in the bottom. The amount of acetone needed will vary depending on the size of the container used; here, 30 mL of acetone was used in a container with a base volume of approximately 400 cm3.\nPlace a piece of aluminum foil in the container to cover the bottom paper towel. Place the myocardial case pieces onto the aluminum foil and orient the myocardial pieces so that the faces desired to be smoothed are vertical. Ensure that the myocardial pieces are not touching one another or the paper towels on the wall of the container.\nPlace a lid on the container or cover with aluminum foil and allow the myocardial case pieces to remain undisturbed in the container until ~80% of the desired surface finish is achieved, per visual inspection. The time needed to complete the vapor smooth process will vary depending on the size of the container and the amount of acetone used. Begin checking the myocardial case pieces for the desired surface finish at 15 min intervals after an initial 30 min. For this study, vapor smoothing took 2 h for a 150 mL structure.",
    "Wearing gloves, carefully remove the myocardial case pieces from the container touching only the outer surfaces. Allow the pieces to completely de-gas in a well-ventilated area for ~30 min, or until smooth, dry, and hard.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62805/62805fig05.jpg\nFigure 5: Vapor smoothed myocardial case pieces.

Pour silicone\nNOTE: Some contaminants, including latex and sulfur, can inhibit the curing of silicones if they come into contact. It is advised to review any technical bulletins prior to attempting to use silicone.\nEstimate the amount of a two-part platinum cure silicone that will be needed to create the myocardial model; the amount of silicone needed will vary depending on the size of the model being created. Alternatively, measure the volume of the myocardium segmentation using a CAD software to determine the amount of silicone needed. Ensure that the silicone possesses the following properties: shore hardness of 2 A, tensile strength of 1,986 kPa, elongation at break of 763%, shrinkage less than 0.0254 mm/mm, mixed viscosity of 18,000 cps, pot life of 12 min, and cure time of 40 min. This study required 300 mL of silicone.\nThoroughly agitate part A and part B of the silicone before pouring the necessary amounts, in the correct proportions, into a mixing cup. If color is desired on the model, add pigment and mix all parts and pigment thoroughly. For this study, 150 mL of both Part A and Part B were mixed and agitated by hand or with an agitator. A Sil-pigment product color \"blood\" (see Table of Materials) was added by craft stick until the desired color was achieved.",
    "Place the thoroughly mixed silicone into a vacuum chamber at 29 in Hg for 2-3 min to de-gas. The silicone will expand during the de-gassing process to approximately twice its volume, be sure the mixing container has enough room to allow for the expansion. Vent and remove de-gassed silicone from the chamber and submerge the blood pool in the silicone to thoroughly coat it, ensuring all voids and cavities in the blood pool are filled with silicone.\nThoroughly spray all pieces of the myocardial case with an easy release product (see Table of Materials) in a well-ventilated area. Assemble the lower half of myocardial case around the apex of the blood pool. If any seams between the myocardial case pieces allow the silicone to leak out, use clamps or a material such as hot glue or clay to seal the leak on the external surface of the mold.\nPour silicone into the space between the blood pool and case wall, allowing the silicone to flow into all gaps. Continue pouring silicone until the assembled pieces of the myocardial mold are filled with silicone.\nAssemble the remaining pieces of the myocardial case, secure the case pieces tightly using rubber bands and clamps, as necessary. Pour silicone down the fill hole in the top of the myocardial case piece until the entire myocardial space is filled with silicone.\nAllow the silicone to set for ~ 40 min. Remove the silicone heart from the myocardial case and trim off any silicone seams that were created from the space between the case pieces or the fill hole.\n5. Dissolve blood pool\nIdentify all blood vessels that should have open ends on the silicone model and trim away any silicone that is covering them to expose the ABS blood pool inside.",
    "Submerge the silicone heart in an acetone bath. ABS will begin to soften 10-15 min after acetone submersion; as this occurs, remove large chunks of ABS with tweezers to increase the speed of the ABS dissolving process.\nPerform two to three additional acetone rinses/soaks with clean acetone to remove all the ABS from the silicone when a majority of the ABS blood pool has dissolved. Remove the cardiac model from the acetone bath and allow the remaining acetone to evaporate from the model in a well-ventilated area. Time required to fully dissolve the ABS will depend upon the size of the model, the amount of ABS removed manually, and the amount of acetone used.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62805/62805fig06.jpg\nFigure 6: Patient-specific silicone cardiac model with a VSD.
