    "NOTE: Mice used in this study were wild-type males on a pure C57BL/6J background. A total of 4 mice were used for multiplex ISH. All mice were approximately 8 weeks old at the time of sacrifice. One male mouse (approximately one-year-old) was also used to demonstrate endogenous fluorescence associated with aging. Animals were housed in ventilated cages within a barrier facility with ad libitum access to food and water. The UT Southwestern Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee reviewed and approved the procedures described below. Details about reagents and tools can be found in the Table of Materials.\n1. Sample collection\nOn the day of sacrifice, administer an overdose of chloral hydrate (500 mg/kg, i.p.) to the mice. Perfuse the deeply anesthetized mice transcardially using a peristaltic pump with 5 mL of 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 50 mL of 10% formalin at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: This is done in a fume hood to prevent inhalation of formalin.\nAs the nodose, petrosal, and jugular ganglia are fused to form a single ganglionic mass in the mouse15, carefully collect the entire vagal ganglionic mass from each side (left and right) with the help of a dissecting scope and fine spring scissors and forceps (see the Table of Materials).\nWhen decapitating the mouse with a pair of large scissors (see the Table of Materials), avoid crushing the brainstem.\nFollowing a dissection approach described before in the rat40, remove the sternohyoid and omohyoid muscles lateral to the trachea with small forceps (Table of Materials) to expose the occipital bone. Clear the whole region of muscle, adipose tissue, and conjunctive tissue until the carotid artery, vagus nerve, the hypoglossal nerve, and foramen magnum are visible. Cut the entire hypoglossal nerve with small spring scissors (Table of Materials).",
    "Look for the nodose ganglion as a translucent mass close to the foramen magnum15. Using small scissors (Table of Materials), carefully break the occipital bone to further expose the jugular ganglion. Look for black melanocytes at the surface of the jugular as a visual landmark.\nCut nerve attachments between the vagal ganglionic mass and extract the whole ganglionic mass by gently pulling on the peripheral end of the vagus nerve while simultaneously cutting the jugular ganglion towards the brainstem with small spring scissors (Table of Materials).\nRemove the conjunctive tissue and fat sticking to the vagus nerve and ganglionic mass as much as possible.\nAs it is easy to lose one ganglion during the transfer from one tube to the other, keep ~0.5 cm of the vagus nerve to facilitate handling and localization of samples.\nPlace ganglia with the help of fine forceps in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and incubate at 4 °C in formalin for 24 h and with 30% sucrose for another 24 h.\nPosition ganglia inside a small drop (~4 mm Ø) of optimum cutting temperature (OCT) medium on a piece of aluminum foil. Next, freeze the sample on a bed of dry ice.\nCut the samples with a cryostat at -20 °C into sections of 14 µm thickness and collect on glass microscope slides as 3 series 42 µm apart.\n\tNOTE: Avoid placing sections close to the edges of the slide. To save reagents, keep the tissue sections as tightly packed as possible but without overlapping.\nStore the samples in a -80 °C freezer until needed for ISH for at least 6 months.\n\t​NOTE: Refer to Figure 1 for troubleshooting for endogenous fluorescence.\n2. Pretreatment and ISH",
    "Before the day of the experiments, autoclave laboratory glassware to be used for ISH, including staining dishes and washing buffer jars.\n\tNOTE: While working under RNase-free conditions is not critical, wear gloves at all times. Keep RNase decontamination solution bottles (Table of Materials) within reach in case contamination is suspected.\nOn the first day, bring the slides to room temperature on a bench specifically dedicated to ISH. Rinse the slides in 1x PBS and bake them for 30 mins at 60 °C in a baking oven (Table of Materials).\nPost-fix the slides in 4% formalin for 15 min at 4 °C.\nBring the reagents in the multiplex kit (Table of Materials) to room temperature.\nDehydrate the slides in 50%, 70%, and 100% ethanol for 5 min each. Apply H2O2 solution to the samples for 10 min and then rinse in double-distilled water (ddH2O).\nTreat the samples with the target retrieval reagent for 5 min, rinse in ddH2O followed by 100% ethanol, and air-dry. Using a hydrophobic pen, create a barrier around the samples.\n\tNOTE: Do not apply the hydrophobic barrier too close to the tissue sections.\nApply protease for 30 min at 40 °C in a hybridization oven (Table of Materials).\nIn the meantime, prewarm the probes at 40 °C and cool them at room temperature before use. Incubate the slides with the desired combination of target probes (Cck1r-C3, Ghsr-C1, Phox2b-C2; or Cck1r-C3, Ghsr-C1, Prdm12-C2) for 2 h at 40 °C in a hybridization oven.\nIncubate negative control tissue with the dihydrodipicolinate reductase (DapB) target C1 probe for 2 h at 40 °C in a hybridization oven.",
    "Rinse the slides in wash buffer and store overnight in 5x saline sodium citrate (SSC) at room temperature. For convenience, split the experiment into two days. On the following day, rinse the slides with wash buffer and incubate them with amplification reagents listed below (see the user manual in Table of Materials).\nApply AMP1 (30 min at 40 °C), AMP2 (30 min at 40 °C), and AMP 3 (15 min at 40 °C). Rinse in wash buffer between each step.\nDissolve each Opal dye (Table of Materials) in dimethyl sulfoxide and store the solutions at 4 °C until needed.\nFor channel 1, incubate the slides with HRP-C1 (15 min at 40 °C) and Opal 520 (green color; dilution 1/1,500; 30 mins at 40°C). Rinse in wash buffer between each step.\nFor channel 2, incubate the slides with HRP-C2 (15 min at 40 °C) and Opal 570 (yellow color; dilution 1/1,500; for 30 min at 40 °C). Rinse in wash buffer between each step.\nFor channel 3, incubate the slides with HRP-C3 (15 min at 40 °C) and Opal 690 (far red color; dilution 1/1,500; for 30 min at 40 °C). Rinse in wash buffer between each step.\nWash the slides and expose them to 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 30 s.\nImmediately apply mounting medium on each slide and place a coverslip over the tissue section.\nKeep the tissues horizontal in a slide holder at 4 °C until imaging.\n3. Microscopy and data analysis\nNOTE: Multiplex ISH data can be imaged with a wide range of instruments with the appropriate filters. However, a preferred imaging method is confocal microscopy with 20x and 63x (oil) objectives; refer to the discussion for the reasons. Refer to Figure 2 for the determination of the optimal signal-to-noise ratio.",
    "Use a confocal microscope equipped with 488, 561, and 633 nm laser lines. Use the following acquisition parameters (see Table 1): Opal 690 (HeNe 633 nm, detection range 668-696 nm, power 2.0, gain 724); Opal 570 (DPSS laser 561 nm, detection range 579-627 nm, <power 15.0, <gain 450); Opal 520 (argon laser 488 nm, detection range 499-535 nm , <power 6.0, <gain 830); DAPI (diode laser 405, detection range 415-502 nm, <power 12.0, <gain 532).\nTo improve the quality of the images, acquire with a line averaging of 4 and a pixel size of at least 1024 x 1024.\n\tNOTE: The above parameters are only provided as an example, and modifications are recommended depending on one instrument, magnification (20x or 63x), expression levels, and endogenous levels of fluorescence for any given tissue.\nOnce satisfied with the acquisition parameters, collect images using the same settings. Attribute false colors to each channel to facilitate visualization.\n\tNOTE: For example, red (Phox2b or Prdm12), cyan (Cck1r), yellow (Ghsr), and grey (DAPI).\nPerform cell counting using the digital images by identifying the outline of RNAscope-positive profiles with one nucleus lightly stained with DAPI. Calculate the percentage of RNAscope-positive profiles expressing each transcript [Figure 3A-C].\nTo improve the rigor and accuracy of the estimates, count at least 2,000 neuronal profiles from at least 4 different animals. Perform counting from left and right ganglia separately.\nInput the data in a pie chart with the total number of counted profiles.\nUse imaging software to acquire images and stitch together 20x images. Use ImageJ-Fiji and another photo and design software to generate the final plates. Apply adjustments to contrast and lightness uniformly to all images.\nSubscription Required.
