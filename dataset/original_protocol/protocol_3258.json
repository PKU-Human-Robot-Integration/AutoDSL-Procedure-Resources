Approximately 16 mice comprising of four\n      biological replicates (3–4 animals per biological replicate) are used per\n      time-point.\n    \n        Following confirmation of stable entrainment, establish the correct\n        dissection times for the time points needed.\n      \n        Prior to dissection time, set up dissection area.\n        \nWipe down dissection area and dissection tools with RNAseZap.\n            Cut aluminum foil into small squares (approximately 4 cm by 4 cm),\n            one square for each animal. Place one foil square onto dry ice.\n          \n        At the designated dissection time remove mouse from the cage, cull and\n        dissect brain following institutional guidelines.\n      \nNote: It is important to collect the\n      tissue at a particular time-of-the-day even if it is not used for\n      circadian studies as the transcript abundance greatly varies with time.\n    \n        Place brain, cortex down, upon the foil square on dry ice.\n        \n            If regions of the brain other than the SCN are to be used in\n            subsequent analysis, the orientation of the brain on the foil may\n            need to be changed so that the region of interest is not in direct\n            contact with the foil. See ‘troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]’ section for details.\n          \n        Allow the brain to freeze for 5 min. During this time, further\n        dissections can be performed. (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3027-Fig3.jpg\n              Figure 3. Dissected mouse brain on dry ice\n            \n        Once frozen, store the brain at −80°C until ready to continue to SCN\n        dissection as specified below.\n      \nCritical: For dark-phase time points,\n      perform the brain dissection under dim red light (no more than 50 lux).\n      Desired intensity of the red light is maintained using filters blocking\n      wavelengths below 600 nm. Avoid any exposure of light whilst collecting\n      and freezing the brains.\n    \nSCN collection\nTiming: 2 weeks",
    "The dissected brains are placed on dry ice and sliced in the coronal plane\n      into 250 μM thick sections using a vibrating microtome. The brain slice\n      between Bregma −0.3 mm and −0.8 mm,6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] guided\n      by the anterior anchor points with the intact optic chiasm, third\n      ventricle and SCN is selected for dissection under chilled conditions.\n    \n        Carry the stored mouse brains from −80°C freezer to the desired\n        dissection area using a dry ice tray.\n        \n            Place brain matrix, sterile razor blades, forceps, dissection\n            needles etc. on dry ice to chill.\n          \n        Wipe the bench area, vibratome, light-dissection microscope etc. with\n        RNaseZap to avoid contamination or degradation from RNAses.\n      \nCritical: Wear gloves throughout the\n      procedure and periodically change or wipe with RNAseZap.\n    \n        Prepare the vibratome (https://campdeninstruments.com/products/7000smz-2-vibrotome[href=https://campdeninstruments.com/products/7000smz-2-vibrotome]) for coronal sectioning by following the specified guidelines in the\n        equipment set up. Switch on the machine with the light source and scroll\n        to the desired user and press [MENU]. The sectioning parameters\n        associated with the user will display on the screen.\n        \nAdd ice to the tissue bath cooling jacket of the vibratome.\n            Fill the metal tray with chilled 1% RNAse free PBS solution. See ‘troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]’ section for details.\n          \n            Cover the vibratome metal chuck (removable tissue support) with\n            tape. Use super glue to stick 1 × 1 cm block of 3% agarose gel at\n            the curved edge of the chuck. This provides support for the mouse\n            brain during gradual sectioning.\n          \n        Separately, place the mouse brain (rostral to caudal) on the brain\n        matrix and cut approximately 3 mm from the caudal end by razor blade to\n        remove the cerebellum.\n      \nNote: Ensure the tissue is perpendicular\n      to the brain matrix and the cutting line is in parallel with the grooves\n      in the brain matrix. In doing so, it keeps the left and right hemispheres",
    "aligned on the same coronal section in order to minimalize angular\n      variation in the dissection plane. This is especially important for\n      non-circular and small nuclei.\n    \n        Apply a tiny drop of superglue on the metal chuck. Now, gently transfer\n        the brain from the matrix to the metal chuck with the rostral end facing\n        upwards and affix the chuck on the metal tray as specified in the\n        instruction manual\n        https://lafayetteinstrument.com/downloads/manuals/7000-v3.0%20Eng.pdf[href=https://lafayetteinstrument.com/downloads/manuals/7000-v3.0%20Eng.pdf].\n      \nCritical: The metal chuck should be\n      submerged in the RNAse free PBS, covering the top of the brain specimen.\n    \n        Manually set the bath to the start height following the manufacturer\n        instructions.\n      \n        Bring the cutting blade to a suitable position by setting the start\n        position using [ADVANCE] and the rotary knob.\n      \n        Press [SLICE ON/OFF] to begin and stop the sectioning.\n        \n            After a slice is cut, press [RETURN] to slide the blade back to the\n            start position (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\n          \n            Section the mouse brain from rostral to caudal up to approximately\n            1.2 mm of Bregma.\n          \nNote: Press [SLICE ON/OFF] to stop the\n      sectioning once the blade reaches the top of the specimen, near the\n      agarose block. After pressing [RETURN], if the slice is still attached to\n      the specimen, dislodge it in the buffer gently with the help of a paint\n      brush.\n    \n        Gently transfer the mouse brain slice(s) with the help of a paintbrush\n        onto the glass slide placed over a cold block.\n      \n        Examine the mouse brain slice(s) collected between Bregma −0.3 mm and\n        −0.8 mm for the presence of intact bilateral SCN (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]) using the cell density contrast under light microscope.

To increase the yield, SCN\n      tissues collected at a single time-point are pooled prior to performing\n      RNA extraction and purification. Post quality assessment, the extracted\n      RNA is subjected to polyA library preparation and sequencing on Illumina\n      platform.\n    \n        Thaw the SCN tissues containing 1.5 mL tubes on ice for RNA extraction.\n        Pool 3 individual SCN tissue samples suspended in Buffer RLT, collected\n        at the same ZT in one separate RNAse free tube. This is referred as one\n        biological replicate (BR) and labeled (for example; ZT2_BR1).\n      \nCritical: The tissue samples should be\n      thawed completely on ice before transferring to another tube. Special care\n      should be taken while pooling the samples to avoid cross-contamination.\n    \n        Adjust the sample volume to 350 μl with Buffer RLT and follow steps for\n        RNA extraction using an RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen) as per the",

The extracted RNA is finally eluted in\n        14 μl elution buffer supplied with the kit. During the RNA extraction,\n        perform on-column DNase digestion as per manufacturer’s guidelines.\n      \nNote: Alternatively, if the brain tissue\n      of interest is different (such as cortex, striatum etc.) any suitable\n      commercial RNA extraction kit such as RNAqueous Kit (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/AM1912[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/AM1912]), PureLink RNA Mini kit (https://www.thermofisher.com/uk/en/home/life-science/dna-rna-purification-analysis/rna-extraction/rna-types/total-rna-extraction/purelink-rna-mini-kit.html[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/uk/en/home/life-science/dna-rna-purification-analysis/rna-extraction/rna-types/total-rna-extraction/purelink-rna-mini-kit.html]) or TRIzol based RNA purification method7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]\n      can be adopted for RNA extraction.\n    \nPause point: The extracted RNA can\n      be stored for long term at −80°C.\n    \n        Inspect the quality and quantity of the extracted RNA for each sample on\n        Bioanalyzer using Agilent RNA 6000 pico chip.
