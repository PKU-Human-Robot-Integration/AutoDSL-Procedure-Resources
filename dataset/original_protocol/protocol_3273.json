Building the behavioral rig towers\nEach behavioral chamber is constructed using the 80/20 T-slot framing system.\n(A) Blueprint of the wheeled tower version containing two behavioral chambers. Only one olfactometer frame is visible.\n(B) Picture of four behavioral rigs within our laboratory space at Florida State University. One of the eight behavioral chambers is slightly larger to accommodate a freely moving odor investigation assay. The panels for the air and exhaust flow meters for both the top and bottom behavioral chambers are visible. The water delivery system for the top chamber is also visible. The water delivery system for the bottom chamber as well as the vacuum flow meters, olfactometers, final valves, and pressure gauges for the top and bottom chambers are not visible.\nAdd rack-mounted monitor, computer, and keyboard.\nBuild the behavioral chamber.\nIf applicable, construct the 80/20 isolated behavioral chamber kit.\nDrill a 3 in hole in the top panel for the fan.\nDrill a 2 in hole in one side panel for the odor, vacuum, and water tubing as well as the cords for the trial LED and webcam.\nAttach the fan and 3-D printed exhaust cover outside of the chamber.\nLine all inner chamber surfaces with sound-proofing material.\nCut an “X” in the sound proofing material in line with the 2 in hole in the side panel to allow tubing and wires to pass through.\nCut a 3 in hole in the sound proofing material that lines up with the hole for the fan.\nPlace the acrylic base on top of sound proofing material to serve as a stable base for the internal components of the chamber.",
    "Assemble the components on a 12 in × 12 in breadboard (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3043-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Inside the operant chamber\nThe mobile tower frames two behavioral chambers. A 12 in × 12 in breadboard (A) acts as an anchoring platform inside of the chamber. The mouse is head-fixed within the 3-D printed mouse holder (B) that is secured on a magnetic base (C) and a 3-D printed riser (D). Odorized or clean air is delivered via 1/8 in Teflon tubing (E) to the odor port (F). The odor port sits atop a 3-D printed odor port base (G), which accommodates a lick tube (H) and vacuum line (I). The combined odor port and base are mounted to a micromanipulator (J) to standardize the distance between the odor port and the nose of individual animals. The micromanipulator is mounted to the breadboard with a 1/2 in pedestal (K) and clamp (L). Water rewards are administered via 1/32 in Tygon tubing (M) to the lick tube (H) after a response has been made by the animal. Lick responses are monitored by an electronic lick circuit that connects to the animal’s metal head-bar and the lick tube via two wires (N). A LED light (O) mounted on an optical post (P) indicates the trial initiation and duration. A vacuum line (I) is attached to the odor port base (G) and ensures the removal of prior stimuli before the next trial presentation. Any residual odor in the chamber is removed by an exhaust fan (not visible) placed in the top of the behavioral chamber. A webcam (Q) allows surveillance of an animal inside the chamber. Designs and files for the 3-D printed parts are available on GitHub: https://github.com/OlfactoryBehaviorLab/[href=https://github.com/OlfactoryBehaviorLab/].\nAssemble the odor port.\n3-D print the odor port base with a high-density infill.",
    "Attach the Teflon odor port to the 3-D printed odor port base with 2–56 screws.\nMount the odor port base on a 3-axis micromanipulator and connect it to the breadboard with 1/2 in pedestal and clamp.\nNote: Once the odor exits the odor port, it is diluted by the ambient air. Thus, it is critical that the head position of the animal relative to the odor port is standardized using a micromanipulator.\nAttach the vacuum line to the odor port base with a barbed connector and 1/8 in Tygon tubing.\nAssemble the mouse holder.\n3-D print the mouse holder then attach the aluminum head-bar clamps with 4–40 knurled press inserts and 4–40 thumb screws.\nAttach a male Molex pin to the outer clamp to attach to the lick-detector circuit.\nNote: If the researcher uses the beam-break method for detecting licks, 3-D printed clamps can be used instead of metal clamps and the Molex pin.\nConnect the mouse holder to the magnetic base with 1/4–20 knurled press inserts and 1/4–20 screws. Secure to the breadboard with 1/4–20 screws.\nSet up the webcam and trial LED.\nAttach the webcam to a 2 in pedestal and connect to the breadboard. Position the webcam at the proper angle to visualize the mouse.\nPosition the trial LED anywhere in the chamber on a 4 in optical post and secure it to the breadboard.\nPlace the assembled breadboard on the acrylic base.\nObtain or construct the olfactometer.\nIf necessary, 3-D print odor vial holders and manifold holders (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] for other 3-D printed olfactometer accessories).\nIf necessary, attach the protective acrylic shield on top of the olfactometer frame.\nMount the olfactometer to the back of the 80/20 frame or position it near the behavioral chamber.",
    "Note: In our setup, a nitrogen tank with regulator serves as the source for the carrier mass flow controller (MFC), while regulated compressed house air sent through coalescing and ultra-high-capacity hydrocarbon filters serves as the source for our dilutor MFC and clean air line (see below).\nNote: Nitrogen gas is used to minimize odor oxidation across sessions.\nAssemble the flow meters, valves, and tubing (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3043-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. The odor delivery setup\nOdor is delivered using an eight-channel olfactometer (inset) that switches between a pressure-balanced dummy (D) vial (via normally open valves, NO) and either odor (O) or blank (B) vials containing only the solvent (via normally closed valves, NC). Odorized air is directed to exhaust to allow the stimulus to reach equilibrium prior to stimulus delivery. Manual needle valves (NV) help equalize the pressure differences between the clean air line and olfactometer as well as the exhaust and odor port lines. An electronic needle valve (ENV) balances the pressure differences associated with different vials on a per trial basis. During stimulus application, the final valve re-directs pressure-balanced, odorized air from exhaust to the animal. At the conclusion of the trial, the final valve returns the pressure-balanced clean air to the animal.\nAttach the final valve to the 3-D printed final valve mount and secure inside or outside of the behavioral chamber.",
    "Note: When the final valve is actuated, the odorized air from the olfactometer is directed towards the animal while the clean air is directed towards the exhaust line. The resting state of the final valve sends odorized air from the olfactometer to the exhaust line, while the clean air is directed towards the animal. This setup allows the odor to reach a steady state concentration before it is presented to the animal– ensuring a repeatable square odor pulse with a minimal time delay.\nCritical: To shorten the time delay between actuating the final valve and the animal receiving the odor, it is necessary to minimize the distance between the final valve and odor port.\nConnect the olfactometer to the final valve with 1/8 in Teflon tubing, ferrules, and nuts.\nIf necessary, set up the electronic needle valve to minimize air pressure differences associated with individual odor vials.\nAttach the electronic needle valve to the 3-D printed electronic needle mount and secure to the framed tower between the olfactometer and final valve.\nConnect the electronic needle valve to the olfactometer and final valve with 1/8 in Teflon tubing, ferrules, and nuts.\nControl the electronic needle valve with the stepper motor driver.\nConnect the 2.5 L clean air flow meter to the final valve with 1/8 in Teflon tubing, ferrules, and nuts.\nMount the clean air flow meter onto a flow meter panel on the front of the framed tower to allow for easy visualization and adjustment.\nConnect the input of the clean air flow meter to the regulated purified air line with 1/4 in polyurethane tubing and push-to-connect × FNPT fittings.\nNote: An in-line manual needle valve can be added to equalize any resistance differences between the two final valve inputs (i.e., the olfactometer and clean air flow meter).",
    "Connect the final valve to 2.5 L exhaust flow meter with 1/8 in Teflon tubing, ferrules, and nuts.\nMount the exhaust flow meter onto a flow meter panel on the front of the framed tower to allow for easy visualization.\nDirect the output of the exhaust flow meter to an area of negative pressure (e.g., a fume hood) using 1/4 in polyurethane tubing and push-to-connect × FNPT fittings.\nNote: In-line manual needle valves can be added to equalize any resistance differences between the two final valve outputs (i.e., the odor port and exhaust flow meter).\nCritical: The exhaust flow meter is useful to diagnose leaks and pressure disparities in the system.\nAttach the 10 L vacuum flow meter to the barbed connector on the odor port base with 1/8 in Tygon tubing, ferrules, and nuts.\nMount the vacuum flow meter onto a flow meter panel on the back of the framed tower.\nConnect the vacuum flow meter input to the regulated vacuum line with 1/4 in polyurethane tubing and push-to-connect × FNPT fittings.\nEnsure the olfactometer can deliver a consistent and repeatable odor pulse.\nNote: The kinetics and concentration of the odor pulse from the olfactometer can be tested using a photoionization detector (PID).\nDetermine the time delay between opening an odor vial and the concentration reaching a steady state at the final valve location.\nPosition the inlet port of the PID at the final valve location and measure the time necessary for the odor to reach steady state.\nModify the training and testing scripts to include this time delay. This approach will ensure the animal will receive a consistent square pulse of odor.\nDetermine the time delay between final valve actuation and the odor reaching the animal.",
    "Position the inlet port of the PID 1 cm from the center of the odor port and measure the time course of the odor pulse relative to actuation of the final valve.\nNote: To minimize this time delay, it may be necessary to move the final valve closer to the odor port.\nEnsure that the headspace of an odor vial does not run out during a stimulus presentation and is sufficiently able to recharge during the inter-trial interval.\nPosition the inlet port of the PID 1 cm from the center of the odor port and measure the amplitude and kinetics of the odor pulse over multiple trials.\nSet up the gravity-fed water delivery system.\nMount a 60 mL syringe with blunt tip needle and two-way normally closed isolation solenoid valve on the water panel.\nConnect the syringe needle to the solenoid valve with 1/32 in Tygon tubing and appropriate connectors.\nMount water panel on the front of the framed tower.\nConnect the solenoid valve to the lick tube on the odor port base with 1/32 in Tygon tubing.\nCalibrate the water delivery system to deliver 1.2–2.0 μL (or 1.2–2.0 mg) per drop.\nPlace a microcentrifuge tube under the lick tube and collect 100 droplets of water.\nEach water reward will be equal to the difference in weight between the empty and water-filled tube divided by 100.\nAdjust the volume of each water reward by varying the amount of time the two-way solenoid valve is open.\nProtect the opening of the syringe from dust or debris with a removable 3-D printed syringe cap.\nSet up the software and valve drivers.",
    "Note: Researchers should utilize the hardware and programming language that they are the most comfortable with and best suits their needs. Below, we include links to all the necessary documentation and information to reproduce our approach.\nDownload the python-based experimental software for use with an Arduino platform at (https://github.com/olfa-lab/Voyeur[href=https://github.com/olfa-lab/Voyeur]), produced in the Rinberg Lab.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nDownload training and testing scripts at (https://github.com/OlfactoryBehaviorLab/[href=https://github.com/OlfactoryBehaviorLab/VoyeurProtocols]).\nObtain the Arduino-based behavioral control system box licensed by HHMI Janelia Farms (https://www.janelia.org/open-science/behavioral-control-system-box[href=https://www.janelia.org/open-science/behavioral-control-system-box]).\nMouse surgeries and water deprivation\nTiming: 17 days\nPerform head-bar surgeries.\nPrepare for aseptic surgery.\nAnesthetize the animal to areflexia with isoflurane.\nAdminister an extended-release analgesic (e.g., Buprenex ER) and protect corneas with ophthalmic ointment.\nShave mouse head and clean the area to be incised with a Betadine scrub and 70% ethanol (3×).\nPerform head-bar surgical procedures.\nPerform a ‘line’ block of a local anesthetic (e.g., lidocaine) at the incision site.\nIncise the scalp and retract to expose the skull. Gently remove the periosteum with a cotton swab and dry the skull.\nInsert two or three microscrews without penetrating the skull. One microscrew is placed posterior to lambda, while the other two are rostral and lateral to the head-bar.\nNote: Ensure that there is enough space between screws to accommodate the width of the head-bar.\nPlace an aluminum head-bar (3 mm × 15 mm, <1 g) on the skull and close skin against the head-bar with a small amount of Vetbond or cyanoacrylate.\nCement the head-bar in place using dental cement.\nAffix a small label to the outside of the dental cement using cyanoacrylate to identify the animal.\nPrior to discontinuing anesthesia, reapply ophthalmic ointment. Remove the animal from the stereotaxic head holder.\nAllow mice to recover post-surgery.\nPlace mouse on a thermostatically controlled heating pad until they recover.",
    "Singularly house the animal with ad libitum access to food and water.\nAllow the mouse to recover for at least two days before starting water deprivation.\nRecord the animal’s baseline weight.\nBegin water deprivation protocol.\nVisually inspect the hydration status and overall health of each animal daily.\nPipette water into a petri dish that is housed inside of a 3-D printed water dish holder in the cage. Mice will have unrestricted access to this water.\nMice with a weight in the range of 80%–100% of their baseline weight receive 1.0 mL of water.\nMice with a weight in the range of 75%–80% of their baseline weight receive 1.2 mL of water.\nMice with a weight in the range of 72%–75% of their baseline weight receive 1.3–1.5 mL of water.\nMice with a weight less than 70% of their baseline weight will 2.0 mL of water. If mice are unable to regain body weight to the desired 80% of their baseline, they are removed from the study.\nContinue water deprivation for at least 14 days before starting the lick training protocol.\nLick training\nTiming: 4–7 sessions\nAcclimate mice to head-fixation.\nNote: The initial acclimation to head-fixation can be stressful to the animal and should be performed with care. Thus, we prefer to gently guide the animal into being head-fixed using the guidelines below. If the animal exhibits excessive struggling or persistent vocalizations, it is removed from head-fixation.\nSet the inter-trial interval to a max of 2 s and start the lick training script (https://github.com/OlfactoryBehaviorLab/[href=https://github.com/OlfactoryBehaviorLab/VoyeurProtocols]).\nNote: The short inter-trial interval is designed to increase the probability of receiving a water reward if the animal licks the lick tube.\nPrime the water delivery system.",
    "Note: It is critical that the animal is rewarded when it licks at the appropriate time. Thus, it is necessary to ensure that the water delivery system is working properly prior to the start of the session.\nPlace a few drops of water on the end of the lick tube to stimulate licking behavior.\nPlace the mouse in the mouse holder without securing the head-bar.\nGently guide the mouse to the lick tube by providing water with a 10 mL blunt tip syringe.\nOnce the animal is licking for water, secure the mouse by placing the head-bar in the grooves of the mouse holder.\nUse the micromanipulator to adjust the lick tube position.\nEnsure that their tongue can reach the lick tube, and that their licks are registering in the program.\nClose the behavioral chamber door and continue to monitor the animal via the webcam.\nAllow the animal to receive water for 20–30 min, then return them to their home cage.\nRecord the amount of water they drank.\nAt the end of the day, give the mice their remaining water allotment in their home cage.\nTrain mice to lick for a water reward.\nNote: Following successful acclimation, the animal will allow head-fixation without struggling and begin licking the lick tube for water rewards immediately upon entering the behavioral chamber.\nPrime the water delivery system.\nSecure mouse in the mouse holder.\nAdjust lick tube position with the micromanipulator and start the lick training script (https://github.com/OlfactoryBehaviorLab/[href=https://github.com/OlfactoryBehaviorLab/VoyeurProtocols]).\nClose the behavioral chamber door and continue to monitor the animal via the webcam.\nAllow the animal to lick for water for 30–50 min, then return them to their home cage.\nRecord the amount of water drank.\nAt the end of the day, give the mice their remaining water allotment in their home cage.",
    "Note: Over successive sessions, the goal is to gradually acclimate the mice to longer time periods of head-fixation (∼45 min) and to longer inter-trial interval (at least 8 s). The animal will learn that the small pressure spike associated with the final valve actuation and the trial LED signals the start of the next trial.\nOdor training\nTiming: 3–6 sessions\nCondition mice to report the detection of a suprathreshold concentration of odor using a standard Go/No-Go paradigm.\nNote: Correct Go responses during the 2 s stimulus window are rewarded with water (1.2–2 μL) and a short inter-trial interval (5–9 s). Correct No-Go responses receive only the short inter-trial interval, while incorrect responses are punished with a long inter-trial interval (15–19 s). Inter-trial intervals are randomized within these ranges to prevent mice from anticipating trial start times.\nCritical: Since over-motivation from increased thirst can mask true olfactory sensitivity,6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] the first ten trials of every session are Go trials and are not included in the analyses.\nPrepare the olfactometer with vials containing a suprathreshold odor concentration and solvent only blanks.\nNote: We typically utilize vapor-phase odor concentrations between 10–500 ppm for training.\nEnsure that your selected odorant and solvent are guided by the solubility properties of the odorant.\nNote: Utilize PubChem or another resource outlining the chemical properties of a given chemical prior to solvent selection. Whenever possible, we prefer mineral oil, as this solvent does not yield a detectable PID signal – allowing us to easily quantify odor pulses in our experimental setup.\nPrime the water delivery system.\nSecure mouse in the mouse holder and adjust the odor port and lick tube position with the micromanipulator.\nRun the training session (https://github.com/OlfactoryBehaviorLab/[href=https://github.com/OlfactoryBehaviorLab/VoyeurProtocols]).\nTerminate the session if the mouse misses three Go trials in a row or reaches 250 trials.",
    "Record the amount of water they drank, then return the mouse to its home cage.\nAt the end of the day, give the mice their remaining water allotment in their home cage.\nCalculate behavioral performance as the number of correct responses (hits + correct rejections) divided by the total number of trials (excluding the 10 initial Go trials).\nTerminate odor training once the animal reaches two consecutive training sessions with ≥90% behavioral accuracy.\nCalculate vapor-phase concentrations.\nCritical: The researcher cannot rely on liquid dilutions to extrapolate vapor-phase concentrations based on ideal gas behavior. For most chemicals, the relationship between liquid and vapor concentration deviates from these laws of proportionality due to interactions between the odorant and solvent.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]\nEstimate vapor-phase concentrations of diluted odorants using a PID by referring to our previously described method.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]\nMeasure the vapor-phase concentration of an odorant in your setup by positioning a calibrated PID in the location of the mouse.\nConvert the resulting voltage to a vapor-phase concentration using your isobutylene calibration equation and the correction factor for the odorant. Please see Jennings et al., 20228[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] for more details.\nNote: An archive of equilibrium equations for more than 100 odorant/solvent pairs (that can be utilized without performing any analytical measurements) is also available.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7],8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]\nClean the olfactometer.\nFor many odorants, our cleaning protocol involves flushing the manifolds and tubing with 70% isopropanol, then nanopure water, followed by air. However, additional solutions (e.g., acetone) may be necessary for more “sticky” odorants. Each solution is forced through all manifolds and tubing via a modified 500 mL glass bottle with a specialized cap to allow an inlet for compressed air and an outlet for the cleaning solution.\nNote: The olfactometer should be cleaned when the researcher changes odor identity or concentration.\nPrepare the olfactometer.\nOpen the cleaning script (https://github.com/OlfactoryBehaviorLab/[href=https://github.com/OlfactoryBehaviorLab/VoyeurProtocols]).",
    "Remove odor vials.\nDisconnect the tubing from between the MFCs and manifolds.\nDisconnect the olfactometer output tubing from electronic components.\nDirect tubing into a solution collection tub or waste container.\nNote: Liquid will be expelled from the olfactometer output tubing and the tubing from each vial when actuated.\nLoad the 500 mL glass bottle with the cleaning solution and connect the output to both the carrier and dilutor manifolds.\nFlush ∼300 mL of each cleaning solution through the manifolds over a period of approximately 60–75 s. The solenoids associated with each vial are actuated for approximately 5–6 s.\nClean the vial septa, vial caps, and vial tubing.\nFill a vial with cleaning solution and connect to the vial cap. Invert several times. Repeat for each vial.\nAllow clean air to flow through the manifolds and tubing for a minimum of 1 h.\nNote: The solenoids associated with each vial must be sporadically actuated to ensure that vial tubing is clean and dry. We typically allow the pressurized clean air to flow through the tubing and manifolds overnight.\nOdor thresholding\nTiming: 7–10 sessions\nPerform the odor thresholding assay.\nThis experiment measures an animal’s olfactory sensitivity by determining their behavioral performance to a series of decreasing odor concentrations in the same Go/No-Go operant conditioning task described above.\nNote: The first session should utilize the training odor concentration.\nPrepare the olfactometer with the appropriate Go and No-Go stimuli. Utilize 3 Go vials, 3 No-Go vials, and one cheating check vial.\nNote: Vial locations are randomized daily.\nPrime the water delivery system.\nSecure mouse in the mouse holder and adjust the odor port and lick tube position via with the micromanipulator.\nRun the experimental session (https://github.com/OlfactoryBehaviorLab/[href=https://github.com/OlfactoryBehaviorLab/VoyeurProtocols]).\nTerminate the session if the mouse misses three Go trials in a row or reaches 250 trials.",
    "Record the amount of water they drank, then return the mouse to its home cage.\nAt the end of the day, give the mice their remaining water allotment in their home cage.\nCalculate behavioral performance.\nBehavioral performance is calculated as the number of correct responses (hits + correct rejections) divided by the total number of trials (excluding the 10 initial Go trials).\nResearchers can also use signal detection theory (i.e., D-prime) to measure the mouse’s ability to discriminate the signal from the noise at each odor concentration.\nBehavioral threshold analysis\nFit behavioral performance data with the following four-parameter equation.\nR\n=\nR\nmin\n+\nC\nn\n∗\nR\nmax\n−\nR\nmin\n[\nC\nn\n+\nC\n½\nn\n]\nwhere R is behavioral accuracy, C is odor concentration,    C ½    is the odor detection threshold, and n is the Hill coefficient."
