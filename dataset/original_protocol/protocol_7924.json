    "All experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with the regulations of the University of Otago Committee on Ethics in the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Ethics Protocol No. AUP95/18 and AUP80/17) and New Zealand legislature. Human brain tissues were obtained from the Neurological Tissue Bank of Hospital Clínic-IDIBAPS BioBank in Barcelona, Spain. All tissue collection protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of Hospital Clínic, Barcelona, and informed consent was obtained from the families.\n1. Preparation of buffers and reagents\nPrepare the following buffers for the homogenization of brain tissue and the preparation of enriched fraction of synaptic terminals:\n\tHomogenization buffer: 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 supplemented with 0.32 M sucrose\n\tResuspension buffer: 5 mM Tris, pH 7.4 supplemented with 0.32 M sucrose\n\tWashing buffer: 5 mM Tris, pH 8.1\n\t1.2 M sucrose\n\t1.0 M sucrose\n\t0.85 M sucrose\nAdd homemade or commercial mix of protease and phosphatase inhibitors.\n\tNOTE: We have used EDTA-free version of Complete Protease Inhibitor mix (1 tablet per 10 mL buffer) and Phosphatase inhibitor cocktail IV (1:100; volume: volume).\nPrepare the following buffers and reagents for the fixation, permeabilization and binding of phalloidin:\n\tKrebs buffer: 118.5 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, 0.1 mM KH2PO4, 5 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM glucose, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4\n\t1 M KCl\n\t25% glutaraldehyde (stock solution)\n\tKrebs buffer containing 0.1 % Triton X-100 and 1 mg/mL NaBH4\n\t400x Alexa Fluor 647 Phalloidin in DMSO\n\tKrebs buffer containing 0.32 M sucrose\n\t50 μM latrunculin A in DMSO (stock solution)\n\t1 M KCl (stock solution)\n\tCAUTION: Phalloidin is toxic (LD50 = 2 mg/kg) and must be handled with care. Inhalation of glutaraldehyde is toxic and it should be handled in a fume hood.",
    "Store the buffers at 4 °C and phalloidin and latrunculin A at -20 °C for long-term storage.\n\t​NOTE: Long-term storage of buffers is not recommended. The protocol can be paused here.\n2. Brain tissue homogenization\nHomogenize the cryopreserved or freshly dissected rat brain tissue in 10 volumes of homogenization buffer in a Potter-Elvehjem glass tube and pestle on ice.\n\tNOTE: Optimal homogenization is achieved by 15-20 strokes of the pestle by hand for brain tissues. Successful homogenization can be confirmed by smooth flow of the suspension through the glass tube. The protocol can be paused here.\nDetermine the protein concentration in the homogenate using a Bradford assay31.\n\tNOTE: Alternate homemade or commercial assays for protein estimation can also be used.\nDilute homogenate samples in Krebs buffer at a concentration of 2-3 mg protein/mL in a volume of 50 µL.\n\t​NOTE: In some of our experiments, we incubate homogenates with 2 μM latrunculin A or DMSO (controls) at 37 °C for 1 h. For this, homogenates are resuspended in 48 µL of Krebs buffer, and 2 µL of 50 μM latrunculin A or 2 µL of DMSO is added. Further for immunoblotting, a small amount of sample (10 μg) is collected after the incubation.\nFix the homogenate samples (section 5).\n3. Preparation of isolated nerve terminals\nPreparation of synaptosomes\n\tNOTE: Alternative protocols32,33 for synaptosomes can also be used.\n\t\nCentrifuge brain homogenate at 1,200 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\nDiscard the pellet, which is the crude nuclear fraction.\nFurther centrifuge the supernatant (S1) obtained in step 3.1.1 at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.\nRemove the supernatant (S2), which is the soluble cytosolic fraction.\nResuspend the pellet (P2) obtained in step 3.1.3, which is the crude synaptosomal fraction in resuspension buffer.",
    "NOTE: The volume of resuspension buffer depends on the amount of starting tissue and the amount of pellet obtained. For example, when starting with 150-300 mg of brain tissues, the pellet obtained can be resuspended in 200 µL of resuspension buffer.\nLoad the resuspended crude synaptosomes onto a discontinuous sucrose gradient made of equal volumes of 0.85-1.0-1.2 M sucrose.\n\t\tNOTE: We typically use 1 mL each of the sucrose solution (for 150-300 mg tissue). This can be changed according for larger tissue amounts. Discontinuous gradients can be made using a 25G syringe pressed against the internal wall of the ultracentrifuge tube and gentle layering of the sucrose layers.\nCentrifuge at 85,000 x g for 2 h at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Because of the high-speed of centrifugation, an ultracentrifuge capable of creating a vacuum to reduce heating is required.\nCollect the synaptosomal fraction at the interface between 1.0 and 1.2 M sucrose using a 200 µL pipet tip.\nWash the synaptosomal fraction with ice-cold washing buffer by centrifugation at 18,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: For washing, the synaptosomal fraction obtained at the interface of 1.0 and 1.2 M sucrose is collected in a fresh 1.5 mL tube, and an equal volume of washing buffer is added, ensuring the removal of high sucrose from the medium.\nWash the synaptosomal pellet again with ice-cold homogenization buffer at 12,000 g for 10 minutes at 4 °C.\nResuspend the synaptosomes in homogenization buffer on ice.\n\t\tNOTE: The protocol can be briefly paused here.\nDetermine the protein concentration using a Bradford assay.\nResuspend the synaptosomes in Krebs buffer at a concentration of 2-3 mg protein/mL in a volume of 50 µL (47.5 µL if synaptosomes are to be depolarized by KCl; see section 4).",
    "NOTE: For resuspension, the synaptosomal fraction is first spun at 12,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and the supernatant (buffer) is removed. The synaptosomal pellet is then resuspended in Krebs buffer by gentle pipetting using a 200 µL pipet tip.\nProceed with depolarization (section 4).\nPreparation of synaptoneurosomes\n\tNOTE: Alternative protocols34,35 for synaptoneurosomes can also be used.\n\t\nPass the brain homogenate through a pre-wetted net filter of 100 μm pore size in a filter holder using a 1 mL syringe.\n\t\tNOTE: Pre-wetting of all filters is important to avoid loss of sample and should be done using homogenization buffer. For this, homogenization buffer is passed through the filters in the filter holder using a 1 mL syringe until the buffer flow out.\nCollect the filtrate (F1) in a pre-chilled 1.5 mL tube on ice.\nRepeat the process (steps 3.2.1 and 3.2.2) for F1 fraction to obtain the second filtrate (F2).\nPass F2 filtrate through a net filter of 5 μm pore size.\nCollect the filtrate (F3) in a pre-chilled 1.5 mL tube on ice.\nCentrifuge filtrate F3 at 1,500 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\nResuspend the pellet (synaptoneurosomes) in Krebs buffer on ice at a concentration of 2-3 mg protein/mL in a volume of 50 µL (47.5 µL if synaptosomes are to be depolarized by KCl; see section 4).\n\t\tNOTE: The protocol can be briefly paused here.\nEstimate the protein concentration using a Bradford assay.\nProceed with depolarization (section 4).\n4. KCl-mediated depolarization of isolated synaptic terminals\nEquilibrate synaptosomes/synaptoneurosomes at 37 °C for 5-10 min.\nStimulate synaptosomes/synaptoneurosomes by adding KCl to increase extracellular K+ to 50 mM for 30 s at 37 °C and add equal volume of Krebs buffer to the respective unstimulated control set.",
    "NOTE: For example, add 2.5 µL of 1 M KCl to synaptosomes resuspended in 47.5 µL of Krebs buffer; and add 2.5 µL of Krebs buffer to the respective unstimulated control synaptosome. For experiments wherein a large number of samples are involved, proceed with no more than 2 samples at a time so that the depolarization time does not exceed 30 s.\nTerminate stimulation by adding glutaraldehyde (section 5).\n5. Fixation and phalloidin staining of samples\nAdd glutaraldehyde to homogenate/synaptosomal/synaptoneurosomal samples to a final concentration of 2.5% for 2-3 min at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: We added 6 µL of 25% glutaraldehyde solution so that the final concentration of glutaraldehyde in the 50 µL samples (homogenates/synaptosomes/synaptoneurosomes) was ca. 2.5%. Fixation is critical and should be fast and hence immediately after adding glutaraldehyde, the sample should be vigorously vortexed.\nSediment the samples at 20,000 x g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant.\n\tNOTE: Discard the supernatant in a fume hood as glutaraldehyde is toxic.\nPermeabilize the pellet by resuspension in 100 µL of Krebs buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1 mg/mL NaHB4 for 2-3 min at room temperature.\nSediment the samples at 20,000 x g for 5 min.\nRemove the permeabilization buffer.\nWash the pellet with 200 µL of Krebs buffer by centrifugation at 20,000 x g for 5 min.\nResuspend and stain the pellet with 1x Alexa Fluor 647 Phalloidin (corresponding to 500 μU) in 100 µL of Krebs buffer for 10 minutes in dark at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: Other varieties of fluorescent phalloidin analogs are commercially available and can be replaced for the assay. Concentration of phalloidin and total sample volume of incubation may have to be modified according to the amount and type of tissue/sample being tested and optimal conditions should be standardized accordingly.",
    "Centrifuge the stained samples at 20,000 x g for 5 min.\nRemove the unbound phalloidin (supernatant).\nWash the sample with 200 µL of Krebs buffer by centrifugation at 20,000 x g for 5 min.\nResuspend in 200 µL of Krebs buffer containing 0.32 M sucrose.\n\t​NOTE: The protocol can be briefly paused here.\n6. Fluorometric analysis and light scattering\nDispense Alexa Fluor 647 Phalloidin-stained samples in a black 96-well plate.\nMeasure the fluorescence intensity at an excitation wavelength of 645 nm and an emission wavelength of 670 nm in a plate reader at room temperature.\nTransfer the samples from the black 96-well plate to the transparent 96-well plate using 200 µL pipet tips.\nMeasure the light scattering at 540 nm to correct for any losses that might have occurred during the previous steps of fixation, permeabilization and staining.\n\tNOTE: Variations in biological material retained in the stained samples might be more prominent for smaller amounts of starting material (see Discussion).\nInclude a set of Alexa Fluor 647 Phalloidin in Krebs buffer at different concentrations (0.05x, 0.1x, 0.25x, 0.35x, 0.75x, 0.5x and 1x corresponding to 25, 50, 125, 175, 250, 375 and 500 μU) for each batch of the assay as a standard curve.\n\t​NOTE: This is an optional step and does not affect the results of the assay particularly when F-actin levels are being expressed in a relative manner (Section 7). The protocol can be paused here.\n7. Data analysis\nThe amount of F-actin in the samples is directly proportional to the fluorescence intensity of bound phalloidin. Express in absolute terms of units of phalloidin bound calculated from the linear curve of the tagged phalloidin standard.\n\tNOTE: As an example, see Figures 2A-B, 3A, 4A-B and Supplementary Figure 2.\nExpress F-actin levels as a fraction of the control samples.",
