    "NOTE: A schematic of the plastic multicompartment chip is shown in Figure 1A, B. The chip is the size of a standard microscope slide (75 mm × 25 mm). The features of the chip, including main channels or compartments, wells, and microgrooves are labeled and are provided for future reference. Figure 1C is a photograph of the chip demonstrating the fluidic isolation of the compartments.\n1. Preparation and Coating of the Multicompartment Chips\nIn a bio-safety cabinet, place the chip into a Petri dish or other suitable sterile container.\nAdd 100 µL of pre-coating solution to the upper left well of the chip and allow it to flow through the main channel into the adjoining well.\n\tNOTE: The pre-coating solution is used to pre-coat the microfluidic channels to eliminate the potential for trapping air bubbles within the chip.\nFill the lower left well with 100 µL of pre-coating solution. Wait 5 min to allow the solution to flow through the microgrooves.\nAdd 100 µL of pre-coating solution to the upper right well and allow it to flow through the main channel into the adjoining well. Fill the lower right well with 100 µL of pre-coating solution.\nAspirate the solution from each well. Aspirate away from the main channels to avoid removing liquid from the main channels (Figure 2A). Immediately add 150 µL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to the upper left well. Wait 1.5 min.\n\tCAUTION: Do not aspirate all liquid from the enclosed main channels.\nAdd 150 µL PBS to the lower left well. Wait 5 min to allow liquids to flow through the microgrooves. Add 150 µL PBS to the upper right well. Add 150 µL PBS to lower right well. Wait 10 min.\nRepeat steps 1.5-1.6 for a second PBS wash.",
    "Check the chip under a tissue culture microscope for bubbles in the main channels. If bubbles are present, perform the procedures below. If no bubbles are present, skip to step 1.9.\n\t\nAspirate PBS from the wells angling the pipet tip away from the channel opening (Figure 2A).\nDispense 100 µL of pre-coating solution into the upper well, angling the tip of the pipet near the channel opening (Figure 2B). The bubbles should move through the channel into the lower well. Wait 1.5 min.\nRepeat steps 1.3-1.8.\nAspirate PBS from the wells angling the pipet tip away from the channel opening (Figure 2A).\nAdd 100 µL of 0.5 mg/mL poly d-lysine (PDL) to the upper left well of the chip. Wait 1.5 min. Fill the lower left well with 100 µL of PDL.\nAdd 100 µL of PDL to the upper right well of the chip. Wait 1.5 min. Add 100 µL to the lower right well.\nClose the petri dish and place the chip in an incubator at 37 °C for 1 h.\nRepeat PBS wash steps 1.5-1.6 twice to remove excess PDL.\nAspirate the PBS from the device.\nImmediately add 100 µL of cell culture media to the upper left well of the chip. Wait 1.5 min. Add media to the lower left well. Add media to the upper right well. Wait 1.5 min. Add 100 µL medium to the lower right well of the chip.\nPlace the chip in the 37°C incubator until ready to plate cells.\n2. Seeding Neurons into the Multicompartment Chips\nPrepare cell suspension of dissociated rat hippocampal neurons according to established protocols21,22 to yield a density of ~12 × 106 cells/mL.",
    "NOTE: Use of cell suspension densities between 3 and 12 × 106 cells/mL is possible. If a lower density is used, the volume of cell suspension to be added to the chip may be increased (see below). The procedure described below is applicable for murine dissociated cortical or hippocampal neurons. Optimal cell densities for other neuron types may vary.\nRemove the majority of media in each well of the chip, leaving approximately 5 µL in each well. Aspirate away from the main channels to avoid removing liquid from the main channels (Figure 2A).\n\tCAUTION: Do not aspirate liquid from the enclosed main channels. Air bubbles may become trapped in the chip if fluid is aspirated from the main channels.\nLoad 5 µL of cell suspension in the upper right well and another 5 µL of cell suspension in the lower right well (~120,000 cells total). Load the cells by dispensing close to the main channel (Figure 2B). Check under a microscope to ensure the neurons are in the main channel. Wait for 5 min to allow the cells to attach.\n\tNOTE: Neurons can be loaded into either compartment. For explanation purposes, the somatic compartment is the main channel on the right side, but either compartment can be used as the somatic compartment. Use of lower cell densities down to 60,000 cells per chip is possible. Up to 10 µL of cell suspension may be added to each well of the somatic compartment in combination with a cell suspension with fewer cells than described above.\nAdd approximately 150 µL of neuronal culture media to each of the upper and lower right wells, and then add 150 µL of media to each of the upper and lower left wells. Place the chip into humidified tray in a 5% CO2 37 °C incubator.",
    "After 24 h, perform a media change by removing media from the wells. Make sure the main channel remains filled. Add 150 µL of media to each top well, and then fill the bottom wells.\nPlace the chip back in the incubator for the desired number of days.\n\tNOTE: Monitor the media every couple of days to make sure it remains light pink. If the media is yellowish, replace 50% of it with fresh media. If the fluid level is low, make sure there is adequate humidity and appropriate secondary containment of the chips to prevent evaporation. Minimizing, or even eliminating, media changes is possible using secondary containment and/or covering the dish containing the chip with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-FEP film.\n3. Retrograde Labeling of Neurons within the Chip\nNOTE: Retrograde labeling can be performed using multiple techniques, including using modified cholera toxin and rabies virus. Below are instructions for labeling neurons using G-deleted Rabies-mCherry or -eGFP virus. Handle potentially infectious materials according to the local organization's guidelines. Additional training may be required.\nWarm fresh neuronal culture media to 37 °C. Estimate ~400 µL of media per chip.\nDilute 100,000 viral units of modified rabies virus in a total of 50 µL using media taken from either well of the axonal compartment.\n\tNOTE: Dispose of tips and tubes in contact with the virus according to the organization-approved protocol.\nGently pipet the remaining media from the wells of the axonal compartment and store in a centrifuge tube at 37 °C.\nAdd 150 µL of fresh warm media and the 50 µL of diluted virus to the axonal compartment. Incubate for 2 h at 37 °C incubator.\nRemove media containing virus and dispose of it properly.\n\tNOTE: Air bubbles may become trapped in the chip if fluid is aspirated from the main channels.",
    "Gently add 75 µL of fresh media to one axon well and allow it to flow to the other axon well.\nRemove flow-through from the second axon well and dispose properly.\nRepeat steps 3.6 and 3.7 once.\nAdd back stored media to the axonal compartment. Add approximately 50 µL fresh media, if necessary, to maintain adequate volume and return the cells to the incubator.\n\tNOTE: Fluorescent protein expression is visible by 48 h and persists for up to 8 days. Neurons can be imaged for up to 30 min at room temperature in neuronal culture media. Culture media can also be replaced with warmed CO2-independent hibernate E with B27 and imaged for longer. Neurons can also be imaged within a well-humidified environmental chamber at 37 °C and 5% CO2. In this case, humidification is critical for minimizing evaporative losses within the chips, which is exacerbated by heating and can compromise neuron health.\n4. Fluidic Isolation of the Axonal Compartment within the Chip\nRemove 20 µL from the lower left well of the axonal compartment and place into the upper right well of the somatic compartment. Wait 2 min for flow within each channel to equilibrate.\nRemove 50 µL of media from the axonal compartment. Add 0.3 µL of 1 mM Alexa Fluor 488 hydrazide to this media, mix via pipet and return back to the axonal compartment. The chip is ready for imaging.\n\tNOTE: Other compounds of interest can be added. Adding a fluorescent dye with a similar molecular weight as the compound of interest is recommended in order to monitor fluidic isolation over time.\n5. Performing Axotomy Within the Chip\nRemove media from the axonal compartment keeping the pipet tip away from the entrance of the main channel (Figure 2A) and store it in a centrifuge tube.",
    "Aspirate the axonal compartment completely, placing the aspiration pipet near either entrance of the main channel of the axonal compartment (Figure 2B). Continue aspiration for 1-2 min. Make sure that solution is completely removed from the compartment.\n\tNOTE: The vacuum pressure for aspiration must be at least 18 inch-Hg for the axotomy procedure to work properly.\nReplace the axonal compartment with the stored media and confirm that the axons are  severed by looking at the chip under a microscope.\n\tNOTE: If bubbles form in the axonal compartment when replacing the media, repeat steps 5.1-5.2.\nReturn the chip to the incubator.\n6. Fluorescence Immunostaining within the Chip\nPrepare 4% formaldehyde fixation solution in PBS (4% formaldehyde, 1 µM MgCl2, 0.1 µm CaCl2, 120 mM sucrose)\nRemove most of the media in the wells of the chip (do not dry interior compartments).\nImmediately add 100 µL of fixation solution to the top wells of the axonal and somatic compartments.\nAfter 1 min, add 100 µL of fixation solution to the bottom wells. Fix for 30 min at room temperature.\nRemove most of the solution from the wells of the chip (do not dry interior compartments). Immediately add 150 µL of PBS to each of the top wells of the axonal and somatic compartments. Wait 2 min for the PBS to flow into the bottom wells.\nRepeat step 6.5 twice.\nRemove most of the PBS from the wells of the chip. Immediately add 150 µL of PBS with 0.25% TritonX-100 to each of the top wells of the axonal and somatic compartments. Wait for 15 min.",
    "Remove most of the liquid from the wells of the chip and immediately add 150 µL of blocking solution (10% normal goat serum in PBS) to each of the top wells of the axonal and somatic compartments. Wait for 15 min.\n\tNOTE: Effective blocking solutions should be specific to the secondary antibody, e.g., for a donkey anti-sheep secondary antibody, use donkey serum in the blocking solution.\nRemove most of the liquid from the wells of the chip and immediately add 100 µL of primary antibody (or antibodies) in 1% normal goat serum in PBS to each of the top wells of the axonal and somatic compartments. Cover to minimize evaporation and wait for 1 h at room temperature or 4 °C overnight.\nRemove most of the solution from the wells of the chip (do not dry interior compartments). Immediately add 150 µL of PBS to each of the top wells of the axonal and somatic compartments. Wait 5 min for the PBS to flow into the bottom wells.\nRepeat step 6.10 twice.\nRemove most of the liquid from the wells of the chip and immediately add 100 µL of secondary antibody (or antibodies) in PBS to each of the top wells of the axonal and somatic compartments. Cover to minimize evaporation and wait for 1 h at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for the recommended dilution of secondary antibodies.\nRepeat steps 6.10-6.11.\nIf imaging within 1 day of immunostaining, keep the chip filled with PBS. If chip will be stored longer than 1 day before imaging, wrap the dish containing the chip in paraffin film to prevent evaporation and store at 4 °C until ready to image.\nFor longer term storage of samples, mounting media (e.g., Fluoromount-G) can be used.",
    "Remove most of the liquid from the wells of the chip. Use a 1 mL disposable plastic pipet to add 2 drops of mounting media to each of the top wells of the axonal and somatic compartments.\nTilt the chip to encourage the flow of the mounting media through the channels. After 5 min add 2 drops to the bottom wells. Wait for 1 h before imaging.\n\t\tNOTE: After using mounting media it will not be possible to re-probe for other targets."
