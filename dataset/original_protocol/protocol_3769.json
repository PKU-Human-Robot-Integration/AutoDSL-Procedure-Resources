    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis protocol includes a number of adaptions and optimization from prior methodologies (Chen et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2], Cusanovich et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3], Lake et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7], Pliner et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10], Preissl et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nSample preparation\nPreparation of samples will depend on sample collection methodology (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], Day 1 overview). For cell lines, we recommend detachment of cells with trypsin or accutase and then proceed to fixation and transposition. Fresh cells should be isolated or viably frozen cells should be thawed immediately and washed 1–2 times with 1× PBS before the start of the protocol. This protocol describes the specific steps for using fresh murine lung tumor samples (LaFave et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Lung tumors are isolated from KrasG12D/+; Trp53-/-; Rosa26tom/+ mice and dissociated cells are sorted for tdTomato expression to isolate tumor cells for sciATAC-seq. Tumors are induced at 6–8 weeks of age and late stage tumors are collected at 25 weeks post-tumor induction (LaFave et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Cell preparations can be used fresh or viably frozen in media (DMEM + 10% FCS) and 10% DMSO; however, we recommend performing the sort of the day of the experiment on viably frozen tumor cells.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/691-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Overview of Day 1 of the protocol before an overnight stopping point\nDay 1 of the protocol includes sample preparation and fixation, transposition in a 96 well plate, sample pooling, re-splitting the samples and reverse crosslinking. Reverse crosslinking occurs overnight and the protocol is resumed at Day 2. Created with biorender.com[href=http://biorender.com].\nTiming: [Day 1]\nCollection of lung adenocarcinoma cells\nTiming: [4 hrs]\nEuthanize mouse using an isoflurane chamber.\nDissect whole tumor-burdened lung or individual tumors and place in 1.5 mL Eppendorf microcentrifuge tubes containing 100 μL Lung Digestion Buffer. Buffer is based on manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/lung-dissociation-kit-mouse.html#gref[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/lung-dissociation-kit-mouse.html#gref]).",
    "Thinly mince tissues using scissors and then add an additional 0.5 mL Lung Digestion Buffer to tube.\nIncubate at 37°C with rotation for 30 min.\nGrind sample over a 100 μM filter into a 50 mL conical tube with pipette tip.\nPipette 5 mL S-MEM over the filter to wash remaining sample into the tube.\nPellet cells by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min. Note: Centrifugation speed and time may be adjusted according to sample type.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend pellet in 1 mL ACK lysis buffer to lyse red blood cells. Incubate on the bench at 25°C for 2 min.\nQuench reaction by adding 10 mL DMEM and pellet by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min.\nResuspend pellet in 500 μL of FACS Buffer. Stain samples with APC-conjugated CD45 (BD, 559864), CD11b (eBioscience, 15-0112-82), CD31 (BioLegend, 102510), and Ter119 (BD, 557909) at a concentration of 1:1000, and DAPI (stock concentration 5 mg/mL; stain at a concentration of 1:10000).\nNote: Use of a dead cell removal kit (e.g., Miltenyi cat no. 103-090-101) is recommended.\nSort for APCneg (immune depleted), tdTomatopos, and DAPIneg into FACS buffer using a FACS Aria (example gating scheme, Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Proceed to fixation and transposition.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/691-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Gating strategy for lung adenocarcinoma cells\nFACS-depletion strategy is shown (TER119-APC, CD31-APC, CD11b-APC, and CD19-APC) and DAPI for a live-dead stain. tdTom+ positive populations (APC negative, DAPI positive) are collected for fixation and transposition.

The dilution buffer can be stored at −20°C for several months.",
    "Critical: Assemble Tn5 immediately before fixation and transposition steps.\nPrepare 1× Tn5 by diluting homemade Tn5 in Dilution Buffer to a final volume of 96 μL.\nMix diluted Tn5 1:1 with pre-annealed adapters/glycerol mix by combining 4 μL diluted Tn5 with 4 μL each pre annealed adapter (20 adapters in total).\nNote: For 96 transposition reactions, 8 sciAD1.X and 12 sciAD2.X distinct barcodes are used, see Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4] for barcode combinations.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_691_14.csv\nIncubate on the bench at 25°C for 30 min.\nAfter 30 min, proceed to fixation and transposition steps but keep on ice.\nFixation\nTiming: [1 hr]\nPellet cells by centrifugation at 300 × g for 3 min.\nCritical: Always coat tubes with 7.5% BSA before spinning to improve cell recovery. Add BSA to coat the entire tube and remove prior to cell fixation.\nCritical: Always use a swing bucket rotor for centrifugation instead of a tabletop centrifuge.\nNote: Centrifugation time and speed may need to be adjusted for sample type based on prior experience.\nResuspend pellets in 100 μL cold 1× PBS.\nCount cells by mixing 5 μL of each sample to 5 μL of trypan blue using a hemocytometer.\nNote: Visually check samples for clumping and debris which may cause issues in future steps (Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).\nDilute each sample to 100K cells in a final volume of 100 μL.\nNote: If cell concentration cannot be achieved, resuspend the entire cell sample in 100 μL. Variations to cell number must be accounted for at the PCR barcoding step by maintaining an appropriate cell density per reaction.\nPellet cells by centrifugation at 300 × g for 3 min.\nDilute 16% formaldehyde to 1.6% with H2O.\nFix cells by adding 6.7 μL 1.6% formaldehyde (final concentration 0.1%). Mix samples by pipetting (Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]).",
    "Note: Fixation conditions have been optimized in specific human and mouse cells lines and have been successful in several tissues including lung and brain. Fixation percentage can be tuned from 0.1%–0.5% depending on cell fragility.\nNote: Omitting the fixation step may enable experiments with limited cell number, but will increase the level of crosstalk between single cells due to excess debris in the sample prep (LaFave et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nIncubate on the bench at 25°C for 5 min.\nPrepare a master mix of 5.6 μL 2.5M glycine, 5.0 μL 1 M pH 8.0 Tris, and 1.3 μL 7.5% BSA for each 100 μL fixed sample. Stop the fixation by adding 11.9 uL master mix to each individual sample.\nIncubate on ice for 10 min.\nGently wash the cells with 0.5 mL of 1× PBS by pipetting against the side of the tube without resuspending the pellet. Spin at 500 × g for 3 min.\nRepeat step k.\nResuspend pellets in 1 μL 1× PBS for each transposition reaction as necessary for pre-determined number of reactions.\nNote: Use approximately 1K cells for each transposition reaction. Adjust the number of reactions per sample depending on desired number of reactions (e.g., if performing 12 transposition reactions per sample, resuspend 12K cells in 12 μL 1× PBS). In total, samples should be split across the 96-well plate (e.g., an example experiment may be 8 samples and 12 transposition reactions per sample to complete the plate).",
    "Note: Multiplexed barcoding allows for transposition of different samples/conditions in the same experiment. Samples should remain separated at this step for labeling by transposition. Based on what percentage of cells needed from each sample/condition, the researcher will need to determine the number of 96 wells that correspond to each sample. The researcher should keep track of the sample in each well for demultiplexing purposes.\nTransposition\nTiming: [1.5 h]\nPrepare Transposition Buffer and Nuclei Isolation Buffer.\nIn a 96 well plate, combine 7 μL of the transposition buffer and 1 μL fixed cells in each well.\nIncubate on the bench at 25°C for 10 min.\nDilute the assembled Tn5 1:1 by adding 8 μL Transposition Buffer to 8 μl assembled Tn5. Add 1 μL diluted Tn5 containing sciAD1.X oligo and 1 μL diluted Tn5 containing sciAD2.X oligo to each well based on plate map (Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]).\nShake at 300 rpm for 30 min at 37°C using the Eppendorf ThermoMixer C.\nQuench the reaction by adding 1 μL of 0.5M EDTA to each well. Mix well by pipetting.\nShake at 300 rpm for 15 min at 37°C.\nCombine transposition reactions and prepare for PCR barcoding\nTransposed samples are pooled together and re-aliquoted into individual wells to add another level of barcoding at PCR amplification.\nPool transposition reactions\nTiming: [30 min]\nPool all reactions from each well of the 96 well plate (approximately 1 mL in total) into a BSA-coated 1.5 mL Eppendorf microcentrifuge tube. Add 38.4 μL 1M MgCl2 to quench EDTA and mix by pipetting.\nPellet cells by centrifugation at 500 × g for 2 min.\nRemove supernatant and wash cells with 1 mL Nuclei Isolation Buffer before centrifugation at 500 × g for 2 min.",
    "Resuspend pellet with 0.5 mL Nuclei Isolation Buffer and pass the entire volume through a 40 μm Flowmi cell strainer for 1000 μL pipette tips into a new Eppendorf tube.\nCount cells using a hemocytometer and dilute transposed cells to a concentration of 13.3 cells/μL in Nuclei Isolation Buffer.\nNote: Final volume is dependent on the number of 96 well plates used for PCR amplification.\nReverse crosslinking\nTiming: [18 h]\nPrepare 2× Reverse Crosslinking Buffer (RCB).\nAdd 2 μL of 20 mg/mL proteinase K per 1 mL of RCB.\nNote: 1 mL of RCB is required for each PCR plate. To increase recovery of cells, the protocol can be scaled up to 9 individual 96 well PCR plates.\nCreate master mixes for each sciP1.x primer and each sciP2.x primer to aliquot in a 96 well plate.\nNote: An example of how to aliquot primers across the plate can be found in Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_691_15.csv\nPrepare Master Mix 1 with the transposed cell sample (concentration 13.3 cells/μL determined above) and 10 μM sciP1.X for each row. To do this, add 15 μL of the transposed cells to 5 μL of each primer sciP1.X (12 total).\nPrepare Master Mix 2 with 10 μM sciP2.X and RCB with proteinase K for each column. To do this, add 50 μL RCB + proteinase K to 10 μL each primer sciP2.X (8 total).\nNote: Prepare Master Mix 1 and Master Mix 2 in PCR tubes to allow for multichannel pipetting when distributing across the 96 well plate.\nDistribute 2 μL of Master Mix 1 across the 96-well plate according to the example in Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5].\nDistribute 3 μL of Master Mix 2 across the 96-well plate according to the example in Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5].",
    "Note: Each well should have 2.5 μL RCB with proteinase K, 0.5 μL 10 μM sciP1.X, 0.5 μL 10 μM sciP2.X, and 1.5 μL transposed cells. Master Mix 2 is made in excess and leftover is expected.\nNote: In the nomenclature for PCR barcodes, sciP1.X and sciP2.X, X refers to the full repertoire of barcoding space.\nIncubate in a thermal cycler at 55°C for 1 h to 16 h.\nPause Point: Shorter incubation times from 1–16 h can be used. We recommend 16 h to provide a convenient stopping point between Day 1 and Day 2 of the protocol.\nPCR amplification and quantification\nAddition of barcodes through PCR and quality check prior to sequencing (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], Day 2 overview).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/691-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.
