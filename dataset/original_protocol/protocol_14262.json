    "The study protocol is in compliance with the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki as reflected in a priori approval by the institution's ethics committee. Written informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study (CSI-Ulm, clinicaltrials.gov NCT02162069).\n1. CT Examination\nPerform cardiac CT angiography with retrospective ECG-gating using 80 mL of iodinated contrast media injected at a flow rate of 4.0 mL/s followed by a flushing bolus of 70 mL 0.9% saline solution.\nAcquire data cranio-caudally extending from the femoral arteries to the subclavian arteries with the following acquisition parameters: the matrix of 512 × 512 pixels, slice thickness of 1 mm, slice spacing of 0.7 mm.\nReconstruct images at 30% of the R-R interval using iterative reconstruction algorithm.\n2. Image Segmentation and Model Generation\nImport CT data from an external device or an internal archiving system into image fusion software by drag-and-dropping the dataset or subsets of data for the selected patient into the Patients view within the application.\nStart automatic segmentation of the selected CT volume by double-clicking on the image series.\n\tNote: Segmentation of the heart chambers (left and right ventricle, left and right atrium, myocardium) and great vessels (abdominal aorta, vena cava, and coronary sinus) is started automatically and will be displayed in the Segmentation work step.\nGo through the image slices and verify if the edges of the aorta and left ventricle are correctly detected and if necessary edit the automatic segmentation in the Tissue window using the Edit button.\nTo perform manual segmentation of additional structures, use the Add button in the Tissue window.\nUse existing editing tools to fill the structure (Inject Dye) and drag the edges of the structure (Drag Edge) in 2D views or remove structure parts with the Free-form Cut in the 3D view.",
    "Perform manual segmentation of the main trunks of the left and right coronary arteries, main artery branches (brachiocephalic artery with right carotid and right subclavian arteries, left common carotid artery and left subclavian artery), left and right iliofemoral arteries, hip bones, and hip joints as described in steps 2.4-2.5 (Figure 1).\n\tNote: Depending on the quality of the CT volume this may take 20 to 30 min.\n3. Image Co-registration and Fusion\nIn the Patients view merge the selected patient with the current patient in the XR system by choosing the respective action in the right-click-context-menu.\n\tNote: Now the Registration and Live work steps are active and can be used.\nIn the Live work step, click Add new tag point in the Tag points window to place three reference markers at aortic valve cusps for facilitating the choice of the optimal projection of the annular plane during the intervention (Figure 2).\nGo to the Registration work step to acquire the XR runs and to perform the co-registration of the segmented models with XR.\n\tNote: XR runs acquired with at least 30° angular distance are required for reliable registration.\nCopy the angiographic projection of the appropriate puncture in ~LAO 20 - 30° orientation (or ~RAO 20 - 30° depending on the initial puncture side) into the Reference view 1 by clicking the button Copy to Reference View 1.\nCopy following x-ray projections acquired in ~AP orientation during visualization of the transition from the contralateral A. iliaca communis to the A. femoralis communis into the Reference view 2 by clicking the button Copy to Reference View 2.\nUse the interaction tools Registration Pan, Registration Rotate (for in-plane rotation), Registration Roll (for 3D rotation) to manually align the model of the iliofemoral arteries with the acquired XR projections (Figure 3A-B).",
    "Use hip bones and hip joints visible in the XR images as additional landmarks during alignment of the overlay in the iliofemoral region.\n\tNote: Now the model is linked to the XR system geometry, and the overlay is automatically being adapted to the current XR projection orientation, magnification, and patient table position.\nGuide the puncture of the common femoral artery on the sheath side (Figure 3C) by using the coarse initial co-registration performed in step 3.6.\nRecord an angiographic projection of the device sheath femoral artery in ~RAO 20 - 30° (or respectively ~LAO 20 - 30°) by clicking the button Copy to Reference View and finalize the image co-registration in the iliofemoral region (Figure 3D).\n\tNote: Since the patient is positioned differently during CT scan and the intervention, registration based on the iliofemoral structures provides only limited accuracy in other regions. Thus, manual refinement of the co-registration in the thoracic region is required.\nTo use these data for further overlay re-alignment, copy any additional acquired projections to the “Reference View” during the transition from the iliofemoral to the thoracic region as well as any catheterization of the brachiocephalic trunk via the right radial artery.\nAfter placing the pigtail catheter in the aortic arch, acquire two fluoroscopic projections without CA in LAO 30 - 40° and RAO 20 - 30° orientation and copy them in the Reference view 1 and Reference view 2.\nUse the interaction tools Registration Pan, Registration Rotate (for in-plane rotation), Registration Roll (for 3D rotation) to manually adjust the registration in the thoracic region (Figure 4A-B).\nGuide the placement of the protection device without administration of additional CA purely based on the anatomic overlay (Figure 4C).",
    "For further refinement, manually correct the overlay position as described in step 3.12 on each acquired XR projection during the entire course of the intervention, ensuring accurate overlay at any time point.\n\tNote: Use aortograms acquired according to the routine procedure for verifying the correct position of the delivery system as landmarks for the overlay adjustment (Figure 4D).\nSubscription Required.
