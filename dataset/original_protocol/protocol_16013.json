    "A PCR-based fragment fusion approach, herein described as PCR fusion, has been described previously to facilitate gene knockout in the filamentous fungus A. nidulans (Szewczyk et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.88#cpmc88-bib-0013]). In this protocol we describe an adaptation of the previously described method to permit high-throughput gene knockout.\nFor gene replacement in filamentous fungi, PCR fusion–based generation of gene knockout cassettes initially involves amplification of three separate DNA fragments (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.88#cpmc88-fig-0001]A): (1) an ∼1-kb fragment replicating the region immediately upstream of the gene that is to be replaced, (2) an ∼1-kb fragment immediately downstream of the gene that is to be replaced, and (3) a fragment that incorporates a selectable marker cassette and a randomly generated genetic barcode. These three fragments are subsequently fused (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.88#cpmc88-fig-0001]B). This fusion is possible as the primers used to amplify the selectable marker incorporate sequences that are complementary to sequences present within the primers used to amplify each of the flanks. To enhance the specificity of the fusion PCR, two nested primers are used that anneal at the extremities of the upstream and downstream flanks.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3c55557c-cc0f-4d66-9d07-68caafb1b03f/cpmc88-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nSchematic overview of fusion PCR–based generation of gene knockout mutants in A. fumigatus. (A) Upstream and downstream fragments are amplified with primers P1 and P2 and with P3 and P4. The hph selective marker cassette is amplified with primers hph_F and hph_R. Primers P2 and P3 are designed to introduce generic linkers (shown in yellow and navy) that would allow fusion to the central marker cassette. (B) The upstream and downstream fragments are fused to the hph selective cassette by fusion PCR using nested primers (P5 and P6) creating a linear fragment suitable for transformation. (C) Replacement of a hypothetical target gene by hph selective cassette during transformation.",
    "For the purposes of this protocol, the primers used to amplify these regions are designated P1 and P2 for amplification of the upstream fragment, P3 and P4 for amplification of the downstream fragment, and hph_F and hph_R for amplification of the selectable marker cassette (in this case the hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene [hph] driven by the A. nidulans gdpA promoter), with P5 and P6 being the designations for the nested primers. In each case, primers P1 to P6 will differ depending on the gene that is to be targeted. However, in order to enhance the reproducibility of the fusion PCR method, we have introduced common linker sequences at the flanks of the selectable marker cassette and on primers P2 and P3 (see yellow and navy blue linkers shown on hph_F and hph_R in Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.88#cpmc88-fig-0001]A). As the linkers used for fusion PCR are common for all knockout cassettes, only one set of hph primers is required for hph cassette amplification. The use of this common linker sequence coupled with the high-throughput primer design and PCR amplification procedure are the key highlights of this protocol. Our combination of primer design principles and fusion PCR conditions will give nearly identical results on any modern thermal cycler.\nMaterials\n100 µM oligonucleotide primers, high purity, salt-free (e.g., Eurofins; see Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.88#cpmc88-prot-0002])\nMolecular biology–grade water, sterile-filtered, BioReagent, suitable for cell culture (e.g. Sigma, cat. no., W3500)\nGenomic DNA from the isotype of the host to be transformed (e.g., A. fumigatus strain MFIG000)\nLongAmp Taq DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, cat. no.

Prepare 96-well plates with oligonucleotide primers needed for the subsequent PCR amplifications (see the Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.88#cpmc88-prot-0002] for primer design).\nThe primers should be arrayed in 96-well plates. Each plate should contain a set of primers targeting 96 different genes and be labeled accordingly. For example, Plate01_P1 will contain all the P1 primers for target gene number 1 to number 96 arrayed from well A1 to well H12; Plate01_P2 will contain all the P2 primers for target gene number 1 to number 96 arrayed in the same manner. Therefore, for PCR amplification of DNA fragments for 96 transformations, six 96-well plates of primers are needed. Each stock oligonucleotide plate should have primers at a concentration of 100 µM, which need to be diluted to form a working solution of 5 µM.\n2. To prepare a primer-premix for amplification of 96 upstream fragments, pipette 180 μl sterile water to each well of a new 96-well plate using a multichannel pipette.\n3. Pipette 10 μl from each well of the stock P1 primer plate of interest to the 180 μl water, and mix by pipetting up and down.\n4. Pipette 10 μl from each well of the stock P2 primer plate of interest to the 190 μl water/P1 primer mixture to bring to a total of 200 μl. Mix by pipetting up and down.",
    "This is now the working solution of primers P1 and P2 to amplify the upstream fragments.\n5. To prepare a primer-premix for amplification of 96 downstream fragments, repeat step 2 through 4 using stock P3 and P4 primer plates. If not proceeding immediately to step 7, seal the 96-well plates containing primer working solutions with aluminum seals.\nSealed plates can be stored at 4°C for 12 months or at −20°C indefinitely.\n6. To prepare a primer-premix for the nested primers, repeat step 2 through 4 using stock P5 and P6 primer plates of interest to make the working solution of primers P5 and P6 for the fusion PCR.

Prepare a master mix solution for subsequent amplification of upstream and downstream fragments, as outlined below. Keep all ingredients on ice while setting up. Mix master mix in an ice-cold 15-ml conical tube, and keep tube on ice until pipetting into the PCR plate.

Check products by agarose gel electrophoresis by loading 2 µl of each PCR product on a 1% agarose gel.\nTypical results should look similar to Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.88#cpmc88-fig-0002]A and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.88#cpmc88-fig-0002]B, such that each PCR product exhibits a band at 1.2 kb.\nWe prepare a single gel consisting of 96 sampling wells for each fragment plate. For a high-throughput method, we check the PCR products of upstream and downstream fragments separately before purification.

    "We normally elute PCR products using 100 μl water instead of Buffer EB provided with the kit. DNA quantification is not necessary for the subsequent fusion PCR.\n12. Check purified products by agarose gel electrophoresis.\nAlthough two fragments will be present, it is likely that at this stage the purified products will appear as a single fragment at 1.2 kb. Seal the plate with an aluminum seal. Plates can be stored at −80°C for up to 1 month.\nPCR amplify selective hph marker cassette\n13.

We normally generate the cassette in a large batch and aliquot. One aliquot is thawed and used for each 96-well plate of knockout cassettes.",
    "Perform fusion of upstream, downstream, and hph cassette fragments\n16. Set up master mix solution for subsequent fusion of upstream, downstream, and hph cassette fragments:\n         \nPer reaction (23 µl total):\n               \n2 µl hph selective cassette\n1 µl of 2.5 U/µl LongAmp DNA polymerase (2.5 U/µl)\n5 µl MyTaq reaction buffer\n15 µl molecular biology–grade water\nPer 96 reactions (+5% for pipetting error; 2323 µl total):\n202 µl hph selective cassette\n101 µl of 2.5 U/µl LongAmp DNA polymerase (2.5 U/µl)\n505 µl MyTaq reaction buffer\n1515 µl molecular biology–grade water\n17.

Amplification using nested primers (P5 and P6) fuses the three fragments into a single cassette (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.88#cpmc88-fig-0001]B).\n18.

The product should exhibit a major band at 4.8 kb.",
    "We do not purify the fusion PCR products further prior to transformation. As shown in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.88#cpmc88-fig-0002]C, apart from the major fragment that is of the desired size of a correctly fused product, there are occasionally some other fragments that can be seen. In principle, these extra fragments have the potential to integrate into the genome upon transformation; however, as we are using a fungal strain deficient in nonhomologous end joining (i.e., a Δku80 isolate), this effect is very insignificant in practice. Based on our experience, the vast majority of transformants produced using unpurified fusion PCR products actually carried a correct single insertion.\n20. Aliquot final fusion PCR products into two 96-well plates at 10 μl/well, and seal with aluminum seal.\nFusion PCR products may be used immediately to transform or stored at −20°C for up to 1 month.",
    "Typically, eight primers are required to generate the linear transformable cassette for the knockout: two to amplify the 5′ flank, two to amplify the 3′ flank, two to amplify the selectable marker, and two nested primers to amplify the final product. We have optimized this procedure by introducing generic linkers; therefore, the same primer set is used for amplification of a generic hph selectable marker. Because of this, only six primers (P1 to P6) are needed for each linear transformable cassette (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.88#cpmc88-fig-0001]A). Primers are designed based on the general rules published by Innis and Gelfand (1990[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.88#cpmc88-bib-0006]). P1, P5, P6, and P4 are 18 to 22 bp in length to have a melting temperature of ∼60°C, whereas P2 are P3 are longer due to the linker introduced.\nIn this protocol, we introduce a high-throughput pipeline using a novel R-script CONC@MATE together with BatchPrimer3 to achieve the rapid design of ∼60,000 primers required for the generation of the transformable cassettes.\nMaterials\nComputer with Internet access and the following programs:\n               \nAspergillus Genome Database (see Internet Resources)\nBioMart tool (see Internet Resources)\nBatchPrimer3 (see Internet Resources)\nR-Studio (see Internet Resources)\nCONC@MATE (see Internet Resources)\nDesign primers for upstream and downstream fragment amplifications\n1. Identify the gene you wish to disrupt using the Aspergillus Genome Database (http://www.aspgd.org/[href=http://www.aspgd.org/]).\n2. Using the BioMart tool (https://fungi.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/[href=https://fungi.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/]), identify the Ensembl fungi dataset for Aspergillus fumigatus; choose from the sequenced strains available.\n3. Select “Filters,” and then select “GENE.” Then, input external references ID, or upload a file of gene IDs.\n4. Select “Attributes,” “Sequences,” and then “Flank (Gene).”\nThe upstream and downstream flanking sequences will need to be extracted in succession.\n5. Select the upstream flank option, and input 1200. Click the “Results” tab, and choose the option to export all results to a FASTA file.",
    "6. Upload sequence files into BatchPrimer3 (https://probes.pw.usda.gov/batchprimer3/[href=https://probes.pw.usda.gov/batchprimer3/]). Change the design settings for BatchPrimer3 as follows:\n         \nProduct size: range, 1100 to 1200\nPrimer size: min, 18; opt, 20; max, 22\nPrimer Tm: min, 58; opt, 60; max, 62\nPrimer GC: min, 40; max, 60\n7. Run BatchPrimer3. Ideally, pick primers that have 1 to 2 Gs or Cs in the last three bases (not always an option).\nAll primers are generated in pairs; be very careful not to mix primers from different pairs.\n8. Name the primer marked left primer as xP1, where x represents the gene identity.\n9. Attach the following linker to the 5′ end of the primer marked right primer to give primer xP2: TAGTTCTGTTACCGAGCCGG(X)18-22.\nThe generic linker is introduced here to facilitate the fusion between upstream and downstream fragments with the hph selective marker cassette.\n10. Select 1200 bp of the downstream flanking sequence, and repeat the primer design process (steps 6 and 7).\nThe primer marked left primer should have the following linker attached to the 5′ end to give primer xP3: GCTCTGAACGATATGCTCCAAC(X)18-22.\n11. Name the primer marked right primer as xP4.\nDesign nested primers for fusion PCR\n12. To design the nested primers used for fusion PCR, return to BioMart, and repeat the extraction process (steps 2 and 3). In attributes select the “Flank (Gene)” option, and input 1099 bp into the upstream and downstream option. Once again, extract the upstream and downstream flanking regions in succession.\nThe selection of 1099 bp is relevant as the outer primers (P1 and P4) will not have been designed in this region, allowing nested primers to be selected.\n13. Name the extracted BioMart files “upstream” and “downstream,” respectively.",
    "In order to design this set of primers, the two FASTA files will need to be concatenated using R-Studio; a free version is available to download at https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/[href=https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/].\n14. Run the R script CONC@MATE in R-Studio using the upstream and downstream files extracted from BioMart.\n15. Install the packages detailed at the start of the script by using the “Packages” tab on the R-studio interface. Click “install” and type the name of the required packages, making sure the “install from” tab has “Repository (CRAN)” selected.\n16. Upload the concatenated FASTA file into BatchPrimer3, and select the same parameters as in step 6, except for the product size range, which should be 2000 to 2198 bp. Name the left primer xP5, and name the right xP6.\n17. Order the primers from any qualified supplier.\nThe primers should be arrayed in 96-well plates at a stock concentration of 100 µM.",
    "The host strain for our transformation procedure is MFIG000 (formally known as A1160 Δku80 pyrG+; Fraczek et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.88#cpmc88-bib-0004]), an A. fumigatus strain derived from the well-characterized clinical isolate A1163 that lacks nonhomologous end joining (Δku80) and hence facilitates homologous recombination. In this protocol, we describe a high-throughput method of preparing and performing multiple transformations for generation of null mutants in A. fumigatus (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.88#cpmc88-fig-0003]). We suggest preparing fresh protoplasts for each transformation, as we noticed that overnight storage of protoplasts reduces transformation efficiency. Production of protoplasts can be easily scaled up to provide enough material for the desired number of transformations, and wherever possible, preparation of transformation mixture is performed in 96-well format allowing rapid processing. For the plating step, we use 6-well cell culture plates instead of the traditional 90-mm petri dishes. Using 6-well cell culture plates reduces the amount of labor involved in experimental preparation, as well as reduces use of culture medium and hygromycin B.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f624e15d-4183-4e1c-b923-c782263dc97b/cpmc88-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nOverview of steps for a 96-well formatted transformation.\nMaterials\nA. fumigatus strain MFIG000 spores (no older than 1 month)\nSabouraud (SAB) liquid medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.88#cpmc88-rec-0006])\nProtoplasting solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.88#cpmc88-rec-0005])\n0.6 M KCl, 50 mM CaCl2 solution (KCl/CaCl2; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.88#cpmc88-rec-0002])\n96-well plate containing 10 µl/well fusion PCR products (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.88#cpmc88-prot-0001])\nPolyethylene glycol (PEG) solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.88#cpmc88-rec-0004])\n6-well YPS/hygromycin B selection plates (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.88#cpmc88-rec-0007])\n250-ml flask, sterile\n37°C shaking incubator\nFoam plug for flask (50 × 38 mm; e.g., King Scientific, cat. no.

    "1. Inoculate 150 μl of 1 × 109 spores/ml A. fumigatus spores (MFIG000) into 50 ml SAB liquid medium in a sterile 250-ml flask, and incubate at 37°C with shaking (130 rpm) for 16 hr. Plug the top of the flask with foam, and then loosely cover with aluminum foil to allow ventilation and prevent contamination.\nMultiple inoculation flasks can be prepared according to the number of transformations. We normally inoculate two flasks per 96 transformations.\n2. Remove flasks from the incubator, and harvest mycelia by filtration through sterile funnels with sterile Miracloth attached. Use a sterile inoculating loop to remove mycelia from the Miracloth, and transfer into a 50-ml conical tube containing 32 ml protoplasting solution.\nFor mycelia harvested from each flask, we use a single 50-ml conical tube containing 32 ml protoplasting solution.\n3. Incubate tube at 30°C for 3 hr with gentle shaking (130 rpm).\n4. Remove tube from shaking incubator, and for each tube, pour solution into a new tube through sterile funnels with sterile Miracloth attached to remove any residual undigested hyphal material.\n5. Centrifuge tube containing protoplasts 10 min at 1800 × g, 4°C.\n6. Remove tube from centrifuge. Remove supernatant and resuspend protoplasts in 2 ml KCl/CaCl2.\nThe protoplasts pellet should be visible at the bottom of tube after centrifugation.\nMake sure you fully resuspend the protoplasts by carefully pipetting up and down until the solution is cloudy and the pellet has dissipated. Pipetting protoplasts is possible as they are quite resistant to physical shearing.\n7. Transfer protoplast suspension from each tube into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Centrifuge 3 min at 900 × g, 4°C. Remove supernatant and fully resuspend pellet in 1 ml ice-cold KCl/CaCl2. Repeat two additional times, and then resuspend pellet in 0.5 ml KCl/CaCl2.",
    "Protoplasts will form a loose pellet after the initial centrifugation.\nIt is critical to keep the microcentrifuge tubes on ice while performing the washing steps. It has been reported that centrifugation can be done at room temperature, but we normally perform this step at 4°C.\n8. Combine the two suspensions in one microcentrifuge tube.\n9. Pellet protoplasts by centrifuging 3 min at 1800 × g, 4°C.\n10. Resuspend each pellet in 1 ml KCl/CaCl2, which should give enough protoplasts for one 96-well plate worth of transformation. Make a 1000× dilution of protoplasting suspension by taking 1 μl from the suspension and mixing with 999 μl KCl/CaCl2. Count protoplasts using a hemocytometer.\nThe concentration of protoplasts should be at least at 1 × 108 protoplasts/ml.\nWe suggest quantifying the protoplasts, as we have noticed that less concentrated protoplasts will lower the transformation efficiency. This might be trivial under normal transformation setups; however, it is crucial for the high-throughput setup described in this protocol. We recommend stopping the experiment immediately once noticing the protoplast count is lower than 1 × 108 per ml and repeating the steps for preparing transformable protoplasts before proceeding to the next step.\n11. Make a final dilution of protoplasting solution appropriate for subsequent transformation, and keep dilution on ice.\nThe required volume of the protoplast/KCl/CaCl2 suspension is 50 μl per transformation. For example, for one 96-well plate worth of transformations, at least 5 ml protoplasts with a final concentration of 2 × 107 protoplasts/ml is needed (i.e., 500 μl of 1 × 108 concentrated protoplast suspension from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.88#cpmc88-prot-0003] step 10 and 9 ml KCl/CaCl2).",
    "We recommend a final concentration of 1 × 107 protoplasts/ml as we noticed using too many protoplasts will compromise the efficiency just as using too little compromises efficiency; however, it is unnecessary to be absolutely precise. The procedure can easily be scaled up if one wishes to carry out more transformations at one time.\nThe protoplasts tend to clump in KCl/CaCl2; therefore, it is important to resuspend them completely when diluting, even if such process causes some protoplasts to lyse.\nTransform\n12. Defrost the 96-well plate containing 10 μl fusion PCR product per well from Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.88#cpmc88-prot-0001]. Add 20 μl room temperature PEG solution to each well using a multichannel pipette, and mix well.\n13. Add 50 μl protoplast suspension from step 11 to each well, and mix by gently pipetting up and down. Incubate on ice for 30 min.\nIn addition to the transforming DNA, we always include (in separate tubes) a “no DNA” negative control and where possible a suitable positive control (i.e., a knockout cassette proven to produce transformants).\n14. Add 100 μl room temperature PEG solution to each well using a multichannel pipette and mix. Incubate for 5 min on ice.\n15. Using a 1000-μl micropipette, plate 200 μl protoplast/fusion PCR product mixture from each well on to the corresponding wells of the 6-well YPS/hygromycin B plates. Once plating is complete, gently rotate the 6-well selection plates to ensure the mixture is well spread and covers the entire agar surface evenly in each well.\n16. Initially, incubate plates at room temperature in a sealed box for 24 hr.\nWe noticed that an initial incubation at room temperature increases the number of transformants.\n17. Tape plates in stacks, and incubate at 37°C for 3 to 5 days.",
    "Conidiated transformant colonies are generally visible by the third day.\n18. Validate transformants, typically by streaking on selective medium.\nIt is beyond the scope of this protocol to discuss the handling and validation of transformants; however, it is critical to validate the transformants before employing them for further experiments. We normally streak conidia to single colonies on selective medium (SAB agar with 200 mg/L hygromycin B) at least two times to eliminate possible heterokaryotic cells before harvesting spores for validation. Briefly, for small-scale validations we normally run two sets of validation PCRs with genomic DNA extracted from purified colonies using primer P1 with hph-v-R (CATCCACTGCACCTCAGAGC) and primer hph-v-F (CTCCGGAGTTGAGACAAATGG) with P4.\nThe expected sizes of amplicons should be at around 1.5 kb. This would indicate whether the insertion is at the right locus. For a high-throughput validation method, see Current Protocols article by Fraczek et al.
