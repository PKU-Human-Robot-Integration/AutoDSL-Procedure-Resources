    "All subjects must provide written consent prior to examination, and the protocol must be approved by the appropriate local ethical review board. All methods described here were approved by the Regional Scientific Ethical Committee and Danish Data Protection Agency.\n1. Preparation of the subject\nAssess subjects' medical histories to ensure that they do not have any previous nervous system disorders other than the disease group that will be investigated.\nInform the subject in detail about the examinations and request to obtain written consent.\n\t\nInform the subject about the insertion of two needles in a leg muscle and that the muscle fibers will be stimulated with weak current.\nExplain that the sensation may feel slightly unpleasant.\nInform the subject that the stimulation can be turned off immediately at any moment during the recording in case of any discomfort.\nClean the subject's lower leg with alcohol.\nInsert the stimulating monopolar needle electrode (25 mm x 26 G) over the anterior tibial muscle and adhesive surface electrode as the anode 1 cm distal to the monopolar needle (Figure 1).\nPlace a ground electrode distal to the anode.\nInsert the recording concentric needle electrode (25 mm x 30 G) about 2cm proximal to the stimulating monopolar needle electrode along the muscle fibers (Figure 1).\nConnect the recording concentric needle and ground electrodes to the preamplifier.\nAsk the subject to remain silent and avoid movement during the examination.\nZero the output of the stimulator and connect the stimulating electrodes to the stimulator (Figure 1).\nMaintain the skin temperature between 32–36 °C using a warming lamp.\n2. Recording of the MVRCs\nStart the semi-automated recording software using the muscle excitability recording protocol and turn on the stimulator. Stimulations will start at 2.5 mA with 1 Hz.",
    "Increase the stimulus intensity manually by hitting the Insert key until a response is recorded (max = 10 mA).\n\t\nAdjust the stimulating and recording needles if necessary, until recording an acceptable response with a stimulus intensity of less than 10 mA. The shape of the muscle action potential should be triphasic, if possible, and stable. Avoid large twitches of the whole muscle.\nInvert the muscle action potential by hitting the minus key (-) if the potential appears upside down.\n\t\tNOTE: A magenta horizontal line appears on the screen indicating the width of the action potential.\nAdjust the position and length of the magenta line by dragging the line with the mouse. The green horizontal line represents the baseline.\nClick OK to start recording the MVRCs.\nSelect a stimulus response relationship from the main options.\nIncrease stimulus intensity by hitting the Insert key to a max of 10 mA or tolerable.\nClick OK to start descending the stimulus response curve.\nClick OK when the test stimulus reaches zero.\nSet the stimulus intensity to level for stable latency.\nClick OK to return to the main menu.\nSelect the option 1/2/5 conditioning stims for RC.\nSelect a protocol from recovery cycle options (e.g., start quick recovery cycle [skip alternate delays]), which is the default.\n\tNOTE: The recording continues automatically for 34 steps with decreasing inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs).\nMake sure that muscle action potential is stable during the recording and that the needle has not moved. The screen changes automatically to main options when the 34 steps have completed.\nClick on Finish recording | Close file | OK, unless a ramp-up frequency or 20 Hz s recordings is being performed.\nFinish the recording and save the data by clicking on the Close file and save data button.\n3. MVRC analyses",
    "Start the analyzing software program to perform the analysis offline.\nSelect the recording that will be analysed and click on the OK button.\nClick on Load parameters from the Files menu.\nSelect MANAL9 option for the analysis. If this is not present on the list, click on Browse to find this file. Click OK to continue.\nWhen a description of MAnal9 muscle excitability analysis appears, click OK to continue.\n\t\nInvert the muscle action potential by typing MM-1 if the potential appears upside down.\nRight-click the mouse to make the magenta line visible. Set the window to the base of the peak response and with a width corresponding roughly to the width of the action potential at that height. Drag with the mouse to adjust the window. The window determines the latencies within which the height and latency are measured, as indicated by the pale blue lines, and green line indicates the baseline. Click OK to continue.\nClick OK to remeasure the latencies and peaks. This will be done automatically.\n\tNOTE: In the display of the remeasured latencies, the latencies are measured to shorter delays than original ones. This is because the responses to conditioning stimuli alone were subtracted from responses to the conditioning plus the test. This ensures that conditioning stimuli do not interfere with latency measurements. As is indicated in the prompt box, single bad points can be eliminated by positioning the cursor (vertical red line) over the point and hitting the ~ key. The bad point is replaced with mean of values on either side in same channel. If there are no bad points, set DE (display end) to just after the last latency required.\nClick OK to create an RMC file.",
    "Ignore most of the options appearing in the \"Create RCC or RMC\" form, since these are concerned with measurements of C-fiber rather than MVRCs. Click Save and Exit to continue. After saving the RMC file, the prompt box provides different options\nIf frequency ramp and/or repetitive stimulation data have been recorded, follow the instructions to analyse these. Otherwise, select Go straight to create MEM file option to create a MEM file. Click OK to continue.\nClick Save and Exit to continue.\nClick OK to add the RMC data to MEM file.\nClick Add from Input RMC file to add this data to the MEM file, then change the directory to save the composite MEM file. Then, click Save and Exit to save it.\nClick OK to save the remeasured QZD file to allow differentiation from the original QZD file using a # sign.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
