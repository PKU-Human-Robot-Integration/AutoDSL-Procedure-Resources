    "All research methods and animal care/maintenance were performed in compliance with the institutional guidelines at the University of California, Davis. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of California, Davis, approved all animal use protocols and experimental procedures (IACUC protocol #21874).\n1. Animal housing\nObtain Sprague-Dawley rats of age 8-10 months old. Prior to any experimental procedure, house the rats in a vivarium and allow at least 1 week for general adaptation in their cages following a 12-h light/dark cycle with food and water ad libitum.\n2. Anesthesia and pre-operative procedures\nAnesthetize the rat with 4% isoflurane for 4 min. Hang the rat by its teeth in a supine position on an intubation platform, and intubate endotracheally using an endotracheal cannula and laryngoscope.\nPlace the anesthetized and intubated rat on a ventilator (2% isoflurane and O2/N2 carrier gas). The rat is adequately anesthetized if no response to a painful stimulus such as a hindleg pinch is observed.\nInsert a rectal thermometer to continuously monitor the temperature.\nPerform all operative procedures using sterile technique. Clip the hair on the head and the femoral region and prep the skin with three alternating scrubs of Betadine and 70% alcohol prior to surgery.\nAspirate any accumulated respiratory secretions by temporarily removing the rat from the ventilator and aspirating the secretions with PE-50 tubing connected to a 10 mL syringe.\nProtect the rat's eyes with sterile artificial tears eye ointment.\nInject local bupivacaine (~0.1 mL of 0.25% solution) into the skin and subcutaneous tissues prior to the scalp incision.\n3. Surgery protocol\nPlacement of intraventricular needle and intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor\n\t\nPlace the rat in a prone position in a stereotactic frame and ear bar the rat.\nMake a 1.5-cm scalp incision along the midline with a 15-blade scalpel.",
    "Apply mild pressure with gauze for hemostasis.\nUsing a sterile cotton tip applicator, separate the periosteum from the skull until the bregma landmark is visible.\nLocate and mark out bregma using stereotaxis and mark out the location of two bilateral burr holes, 1.4 mm lateral and 0.9 mm posterior to the bregma.\nUsing a hand-held drill, create these two small (up to 2 mm) cranial burr holes in the right and left hemispheres. Irrigate out any excess bone chips with sterile Lactated Ringer's solution.\nIn the right hemisphere, position a 22-G guide cannula at the level of the burr hole to insert the 28-G needle through the cannula to the depth of the right lateral ventricle (4.6 mm in relation to the bregma) in order to create IVH.\nConnect the fiberoptic pressure sensor to the read-out unit. Turn on the read-out unit and ensure the units selected are in mmHg. Then prime the sensor by submerging its tip into a small beaker with Lactated Ringer's solution until the read-out unit reads out zero. Once it is zeroed in the Lactated Ringers solution, it is all set to be inserted.\nIn the left hemisphere, gently insert the pressure sensor to 2-3 mm depth into the cortex for real-time ICP monitoring.\nFemoral artery cannulation and insertion of mean arterial pressure (MAP) monitor\n\t\nAfter insertion of the ICP monitor, turn the lower trunk of the rat for easy access to the left thigh and groin area.\nAfter sterile preparation and local bupivacaine administration, make a 1.5 cm skin incision over the hindlimb with a 15-blade scalpel.\nDissect out the left femoral artery first superficially with a hemostat and then deeper layers using forceps with fine tips under a microscope. Identify the deep blue femoral vein to help locate the adjacent artery.",
    "Tie off the distal femoral artery using 3-0 silk suture and place a temporary metal clip on the proximal portion of the femoral artery.\nHave a second fiberoptic pressure sensor connected to the read-out unit already primed. Insert the pressure sensor into the polyethylene (PE-50) tubing, which is inserted into a Tuohy Borst that is then closed. Connect the Tuohy Borst to a 3-way-stopcock connected to a 1 mL syringe at one end and a 22-G needle with PE-50 tubing at the other end.\nUnder the microscope, make a 2 mm femoral arteriotomy with micro scissors and cannulate it with PE-50 tubing connected to the rest of the setup.\nIntraventricular injection\n\t\nAspirate 500 µL of blood using a 1 mL syringe and turn the 3-way-stopcock to have the pressure sensor read MAP.\nPrime the 28-G intraventricular needle connected to PE-50 tubing with the aspirated blood for IVH animals and Lactated Ringer's for the vehicle control animals. Then insert this needle into the guide cannula to the depth of the right lateral ventricle.\nUsing 100 µL/min rate, inject the blood or sterile Lactated Ringer's solution (200 µL) into the right lateral ventricle by pumping the 1 mL syringe with the thumb. Prior to this and during intraventricular injection, monitor and record ICP, arterial blood pressure, and rectal temperature.\nMonitor and record the post-injection ICP and MAP values.\nClosure\n\t\nFollowing completion of the intraventricular injection, withdraw the PE-50 tubing containing the pressure sensor that was inserted into the femoral artery and apply the temporary clip to the femoral artery to prevent bleeding.\nTie off the proximal portion of the femoral artery using the 3-0 silk suture.\nClose the femoral incision in an interrupted fashion using 3-0 silk.\nRemove the guide cannula with the intraventricular needle and the ICP monitor.",
    "Seal the burr holes with bone wax.\nClose the cranial incision with 3-0 silk suture in an interrupted fashion.\nApply topical bupivacaine to the incision and inject 0.35 mL of carprofen (5 mg/kg) postoperatively. Do not leave animals unattended until they have regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\nAllow rats to fully recover after surgery under supervision and return them to their home cages with free access to food and water after recovery.\n4. Postoperative management\nCheck all postoperative animals daily for seven postoperative days to monitor their recovery, neurological status, behavior, weight, and incisions.\nAdminister 0.35 mL of carprofen (5 mg/kg) by subcutaneous injection at the time of surgery and on the 1st and 2nd postoperative days.\nRemove the sutures on the 7th postoperative day in a sterile fashion.\nSubscription Required.
