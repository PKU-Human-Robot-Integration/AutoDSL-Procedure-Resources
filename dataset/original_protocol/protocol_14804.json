    "The use of human tissue must be reviewed by an institutional review board (IRB) or equivalent. The work described here was approved and declared exempt by the Massachusetts General Hospital Institutional Review Board (No. 2011P001496).\n1. Solution Preparation\nAseptically add supplements to phenol red-free Williams’ medium E as outlined in Table 1. The solution should be prepared fresh before use. Insulin should be added just before use.\n2. Back Table Preparation of the Liver\nPlace an ice-filled organ bowl on a sterile, draped surface. Remove the liver from the box, leaving it in the bag of cold preservation solution. Keep the liver mostly submerged.\nIdentify the hepatic artery (HA), which will be located distal to the aortic patch. Dissect free the artery to reveal various cut branches along the length using Metzenbaum scissors. Carefully dissect the entire length of the artery to prevent severing a vessel that supplies the liver. Do not cut or tie branches that do not have a visible end.\nTie off all arterial branches not supplying the liver using silk suture ranging from size 0 to 4–0, depending on the size of the vessel. Close branches that are too short to tie or holes in the artery with a stitch of 7–0 prolene. Tie and cut the splenic and left gastric arteries close to their origin on the celiac trunk.\nRemove the aortic patch by cutting the celiac trunk directly under the patch. Cannulate the celiac trunk using the aortic cannula.\nIdentify the portal vein (PV) and bluntly dissect it free. Tie off any branches and cannulate the PV with the prepared segment of size 24 tubing.\nRemove sections of diaphragm from the suprahepatic vena cava, without cutting the vein itself. Outflow from the vena cava drains directly into the organ chamber.",
    "Cut 2 full-circumference tissue samples (2-3 mm length) from the end of the common bile duct; snap freeze one in liquid nitrogen (store at -80 °C) and store the other in 10% buffered formalin, for tissue and histological analysis, respectively. Cannulate the common bile duct with the vessel cannula and a drain tube made of membrane oxygenator tubing.\nIdentify and ligate the cystic duct with a 0 silk tie. The cystic duct is found between the common bile duct and the gall bladder.\nConnect the flush tubing set to ice-cold bags of Lactated Ringer’s (LR) solution and prime the tubing, removing all air.\nSet the flow regulator on the flush tubing to a slow trickle. Prior to connecting the flush tubing to the portal vein cannula, occlude the portal vein with fingers at the hilum and fill the cannula and vein with flush to remove the air from the portal vein. Do not elevate the bag more than 20 cm over the height of the liver during cold flushing to avoid excessive pressure on the vein.\nDuring the flush briefly occlude the PV at the lowest point. Examine the PV for leaks. Vessel branches can be closed off as described above. Flush the liver through the PV with a total of 2 L of ice-cold LR.\nRepeat steps 2.10, 2.11 for the HA with 1 L of LR.\n3. Priming the SNMP System\nPrime the perfusion device by adding 2 L of perfusate (21°C) to the organ bowl and starting the device to prime the tubing. Follow the device’s instruction to prepare for perfusion, setting the temperature to 21 °C. Begin with pressures of 3 mmHg and 30 mmHg on the PV and HA, respectively. Open the gas tank and set to a flow of 3 L/min.",
    "Take a blood gas sample from both the HA and PV inflow by drawing a 0.3 ml sample from the sample ports and running it in the blood gas analysis machine according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Confirm adequate oxygenation (pO2 >700 mmHg) and pH (7.35-7.45).\nBefore the liver is connected take a 1.0 ml sample of the perfusate as a t=0 measurement in an eppendorf tube and store at -80 °C. Cut two ± 250 mg wedge biopsies from the liver using a single-edged steel blade; snap freeze one in liquid nitrogen (store at –80 °C) and store the other in 10% buffered formalin. Weigh the liver before perfusion.\n4. Human Liver Perfusion\nTransfer the liver to the device. Connect the PV inflow to the PV cannula, after removing air from the PV as in step 2.10. Connect the HA in a similar fashion. Set PV and HA pressure to 3 and 30 mmHg. The liver should be nearly submerged by perfusate. Cover any dry surfaces, including the inflow vessels, with wet sterile gauze to prevent dehydration\nLet the bile tubing drain into a collection container. Make sure the opening of the bile drain is at the level of the liver or lower to allow bile to run out freely.\nTarget flow rates are 275–325 ml/min.kg and 50–100 ml/min.kg for the PV and HA respectively once the liver has warmed to 21 °C. Since every liver reacts differently to perfusion, monitor the flow closely during the first minutes. Increase or decrease the pressure on either of the vessels if the target flow rates are not reached. Do not exceed 50 mmHg on the HA and 5 mmHg on the PV.",
    "Samples can be taken from the liver tissue, perfusate and bile at the investigators preference. We recommend at a minimum the following sample collection regimen during perfusion.\n\t\nTissue biopsies, n = 2 x 250 mg, every hour. Storage: snap freeze one in liquid nitrogen and store at –80 °C long-term. Additionally, take another biopsy before and after perfusion and fix in 10% buffered formalin (n = 1)\nPerfusate samples, n = 2x 1 ml, every 15 min for the first hour and every 30 min thereafter. Draw samples from the PV inflow sample port. Storage: –80 °C long-term.\nBlood gas analysis of PV and HA inflow, and vena cava outflow. n = 3 x 0.3 ml, every 30 min. Draw samples from both the PV and HA sample ports. Draw a 0.3 ml sample from the vena cava by inserting a syringe into the vein and directly run in the blood gas analyzer. Use the output to ensure adequate oxygenation and pH.\nBile production, n = 1 x 1 ml, every hr. Visually quantify bile production every hour and take a sample from the collection container. Renew the container after sampling. Storage: dry ice and –80 °C long-term.\nContinue perfusion for 3 hr. Monitoring the pressure, pH and oxygenation and taking samples throughout. Adjust the he pH by adding sodium bicarbonate to the perfusate.\nAt the end of perfusion take the final samples while the liver is being perfused. Disconnect the liver and remove the bile duct cannula. Take 2 post-perfusion tissue samples of the bile duct as described before for storage at –80 °C and in 10% buffered formalin.\nDiscard the human liver following proper biohazard disposal guidelines."
