    "The procedures for working with zebrafish embryos described in this protocol were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Notre Dame.\n1. Ringer’s Solution Preparation\nMake a solution of 116 mM NaCl, 2.9 mM KCl, 3.6 mM CaCl2, and 5 mM Hepes with ultrapure H2O through continual stirring to avoid any salt precipitation.\nAfter adding salts and while the solution is still stirring, add 100 units/penicillin per mL and 100 µg streptomycin per ml.\nAfter adding all antibiotics and salts, perform filter sterilization of the solution and store in the sterile container.\n\tNote: N-Phenylthiourea (1-Phenyl-2-thiourea) or PTU can be added to Ringer’s Solution to block the formation of pigment in bead implanted embryos without negative consequences to embryo health. To prepare Ringer’s/pigmentation blocking solution, use a concentration of 0.003 % PTU. Due to the low concentration of PTU to be added it is advised that a larger volume of Ringer’s Solution be made, at least 1 L, to avoid adding miniscule amounts of PTU powder. Add PTU during step 1.2, while the solution is stirring.\n2. Tricaine Solution Preparation\nAdd 2 g of Ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate salt (Tricaine) per L of solution plus 0.1 M Tris, from a 1 M stock balanced to a pH of 9.5 and made with ultrapure H2O.\n\tNote: Tricaine will be used to euthanize the zebrafish embryos at the desired time point to assay bead implantation phenotypes.\n3. E3 Solution Preparation\nMake a solution of 0.25 M NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 12.5 mM CaCl2,and 16.6 mM MgSO4 to 1 L of ultrapure water to create 1 L of E3.\nAdd 200 µl of Methylene Blue to the E3 solution to inhibit fungal growth.\n4. Pulling Needles for Microbead Transfer",
    "Use fire polished borosilicate glass with filament at an O.D.: 1.0 mm, I.D.: 0.5 mm, at a length of 10 cm.\nPlace borosilicated glass into a micropipette puller to prepare fine needles.\n\tNote: The following four dimensions can be used as a starting point to pull the needles: Heat = 540, Pull = 245, Velocity = 200, and Time = 125.\nAfter pulling an adequate number of needles, store in covered plastic petri dishes, positioned on strips of modeling clay or adhesive tape to prevent breaking the needle tip, until use.\nTo trim the needle tip to the desired bore size, use a pair of fine forceps to score the end of the needle.\n\tNote: Needle bore size will vary depending on the microbead size being utilized as well as user handling preferences. A good starting point is to craft bore sizes in a range between 100 and 200 µm if microbeads ranging from 50-100 µm will be utilized.\nPrior to use, insert the trimmed needle into the capillary tube holder to fashion the completed microbead transfer instrument.\n5. Whisker/Lash Tool Preparation\nObtain a whisker, lash, or other small yet firm piece of natural or synthetic hair filament. Cut near the base of the filament at a 45° angle. Adhere the whisker to a P-1000 micropipette tip using permanent clear adhesive glue.\n6. Microbead Implantation Tray Preparation\nMix 2 g of agarose with 100 ml of E3 solution to make a 2 % E3 agarose gel.\nHeat the 2 % agarose solution for 1 min and 30 sec in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask, swirling the flask every 30 sec in order to avoid the gel from bubbling over.",
    "Take the lid of a 60 mm x 15 mm petri dish and place it in a larger 150 mm x 15 mm dish with the interior facing upward.\nPour the hot agarose gel into the 150 mm x 15 mm petri dish, making sure to anchor down the lid of the smaller dish with the index finger.\n\tNote: Allow a thin layer of agarose below the lid of the smaller dish to remove condensation that will form when pouring the gel; this will make the beads easier to see under a dissection microscope.\nAs the agarose cools, but before it solidifies, place a well mold on the gel. This will allow for easier placement of the embryos.\nNote: In order to avoid bubbles in the wells, place the mold slowly at an angle until it is floating on top of the gel.\nUsing a microspatula, carefully remove the well mold once the gel has solidified. Add E3 solution and store at 4 °C.\n7. Embryo Collection\nPrepare mating chambers, separated by dividers, by filling them up with system water, and then placing adult zebrafish male(s) and female(s) pairs in the chambers O/N.\nCollect fertilized eggs using a fine wire mesh strainer (embryonic stages will vary slightly).\nDeposit the fertilized eggs in a clean, 10 cm diameter petri dish by turning the strainer upside down and rinsing it with a fine stream of E3 until there are no eggs left in the strainer, and there approximately 25 ml of E3 solution in the dish.\nAfter collection, divide the eggs into several dishes (approximately 50-60 eggs per dish) to avoid overcrowding, which might lead to developmental asynchrony within the clutch and make collecting desired times points difficult.",
    "Incubate embryos in E3 solution at 28.5 °C to enable developmental assessment according to the standard zebrafish staging series 40.\n\tNote: The embryos should be transferred to E3/PTU at 24 hr post fertilization (hpf) to prevent pigment development if manipulations at older stages necessitate optical clarity.\n8. Bead Implantation\nIncubate the microbeads in desired test molecule concentration or the corresponding vehicle solution for the required time in an appropriate volume.\n\tNote: The researcher can use sterile Petri dishes ranging from 3-6 cm in diameter, or multi-well plates, both of which enable visualization of the microbeads within the solution. Time may vary depending on the type and amount of molecule of interest, and the researcher should refer to manufacturer or published recommendations for duration of incubation and other aspects such as sensitivity to light and temperature.\nOnce the embryos have reached the desired developmental time point, remove the embryos from their chorions using fine forceps.\nIncubate the embryos in the filtered Ringer solution with antibiotics for 10 min to acclimate them to the solution.\nWhile the embryos are acclimating, transfer the microbeads into the microbead plate nestled within the implantation tray and rinse them in Ringer solution for 10 min.\n\tNote: Implant the beads within 50 min after reaching this point. This will decrease the likelihood that one will implant a bead with a smaller concentration of the molecule of interest.\nArray the embryos into the wells of the microbead implantation tray, taking care to orient them so the area of interest where the microbead will be implanted is accessible.\nMake a small incision on the embryo using the tungsten needle.",
    "Transfer a microbead onto the embryo using the microcapillary transfer pipette: depressing the bulb of the pipette, gently pull the microbead into the capillary column, and then release the pressure to transfer the microbead at the desired destination.\nUse the whisker/lash tool to position the microbead inside the embryo. Note: Be sure to position the microbead into the tissue away from the site of incision so the microbead will not be expelled from the embryo as it heals."
