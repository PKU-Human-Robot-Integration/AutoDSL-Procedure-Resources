Data Collection\nNOTE: Request beam time as early as possible. For ESRF, guidelines on available access types and on how to submit an application can be found at:",
    "http://www.esrf.eu/UsersAndScience/UserGuide/Applying[href=http://www.esrf.eu/UsersAndScience/UserGuide/Applying]. After the acceptance of the proposal and an invitation for the experiment, all participants have to complete a safety training. After validation of the training, fill in the “A-form” (via the ESRF user portal) to declare the researchers visiting the beamline for the experiment, along with the required safety information on the samples. Contact the local contact person to discuss the experiment.\nSEC-SAXS data collection\n\tNOTE: For online purification, use the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system installed at BM29. The system consists of an in-line degasser, a binary pump, a valve for buffer selection and gradients, an autosampler, a UV-VIS array photospectrometer, and a conductometer. It is directly attached to the flow-through capillary of the SAXS exposure unit19.\n\t\nPut 1 mL of the gel filtration buffer aside. Connect the buffer bottle to the SEC system (the default is Port A).\nChoose the flow rate depending on the column in use. Note: For the size-exclusion column used here, the flow rate is 0.1 mL/min. Define the maximum pressure for the column, take note of the back-pressure, and set the acquisition time to at least 1.2 CV.\nFlush the pumps and the upstream tubes via the \"auto-purge\" function.\nWait until the system is filled with the buffer and connect the column. Equilibrate the column by passing at least 1.5 CV.\nInterlock the hutch and measure the buffer set aside in step 2.1.1, using the sample changer to control for variation of the signal due to radiation damage. Only continue if there is no radiation damage to the buffer.\nSwitch the beamline control system to HPLC mode. Make a test run of buffer, collecting 200 frames with 1 s per frame. Write down the number of counts given by the detector in the summed intensity plot.",
    "NOTE: The signal should match the previously measured buffer, and the summed intensity over time should remain constant. If the signal does not match or is not constant, a longer equilibration of the system is required.\nSpin down the sample at 13,000 x g in a tabletop microtube centrifuge for at least 10 min.\nFill the sample into an HPLC-compatible glass vial (provided) and put it into the auto-injector. Note the well position.\nInterlock the experimental hutch using standard procedure, as explained in the User Safety Training.\nLog into and create a folder for data storage through the beamline control software.\nProgram the HPLC system using the \"quick batch\" feature. Set the storage location for the UV data to the folder created in step 2.1.10. Make sure to activate the automatic ASCII conversion of the UV data, storing the ASCII file in the same folder.\n\t\t\nChoose the injection volume and well position. Add the measurement to queue by pressing the \"Start\" button. The software will ask to save the batch. Prepare for saving, but do not press the \"Save\" button, as this automatically starts the measurement.\nSet up data collection parameters in the beamline control software. Choose the number of frames so that the total data collection time is in slight excess of the acquisition time defined in step 2.1.2.\nOpen the safety shutter and start SAXS data collection using the beamline control software. Verify that the data are correctly acquired. Compare the newly collected data to the data collected in step 2.1.6 and check that the number of counts in the summed intensity remains constant for at least 100 frames and matches the value from step 2.1.6.",
    "Start the SEC run by pressing the \"Save\" button, as prepared in step 2.1.11, and note the frame number displayed in the camserver software when the injection is completed and UV data acquisition starts.\nAfter the data collection, open the ISPyB database20 at Open the \"data acquisition\" tab and press the \"Go\" button to access the data set and the results of the automatic analysis21.\nIEC-SAXS data collection\n\tNOTE: Instead of the continuous linear gradient commonly applied in IEC experiments, use a step-wise gradient in which the amount of buffer B is increased in pre-set discrete steps.\n\t\nCreate the HPLC program for a sample-free buffer run. Program a step-wise gradient starting from 0% buffer B and increasing by 5 percentage points after two CV until 100% of buffer B is reached.\nPut some of each buffer aside. Connect the bottle with the low-salt buffer A to port A and the one with the high-salt buffer B to port B.\nChoose the flow rate and stay below the pressure limit of the column (in this example, 1 mL/min).\nAs in step 2.1.3, flush the pumps and upstream tubing by using the \"auto-purge\" function.\nEquilibrate the system in low-salt buffer A (see step 1.15) and connect the ion-exchange column. Wait until the column is completely equilibrated (at least 1.5 CV).\nUse the buffer set aside in step 2.2.2 to examine buffers A and B for radiation damage using the sample changer, as in step 2.1.5.\nCheck the buffer coming out of the column, as in step 2.1.6. Compare the signal to the signal of buffer A recorded in step 2.2.6. Note again the number of counts in the summed intensity plot.\nCreate a folder for data storage for the buffer run.",
    "Set up data collection in HPLC system mode. Choose the number of frames so that the total data collection time is in excess of the total time of the IEC run (see step 2.2.1).\nOpen the safety shutter and start the SAXS data collection. Verify that it proceeds correctly and double-check that the summed intensity remains constant at the value noted in step 2.2.7 for at least 100 frames.\nUse the \"Single Run\" feature of the HPLC software and start the step-wise gradient programmed in step 2.2.1. For the injection, set the vial number to -1 in order to inject no sample in this step. Write down the number of frames acquired as the program starts.\nCreate the HPLC program for the sample run. Program a step-wise gradient starting from 0% of buffer B. Estimate the percentage of buffer B at each peak measured offline in step 1.1.5 (Figure 1B). Set at least 3 steps exactly 1 percentage point below and 1.5 points above the peaks of interest, each for 2.5 CV (Figure 1C). Add a final step at 100% buffer B for 2.5 CV.\nSpin down the sample at 13,000 x g in a tabletop microtube centrifuge for at least 10 min.\nDilute D5323-785 into the salt concentration of buffer A (25 mM) by mixing it with 20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7], 10% glycerol, and 1 mM DTT.\nLoad the sample manually onto the column. Put the buffer A input tube into the diluted sample after pausing the pumps to avoid the formation of air bubbles. Disconnect the column from the detectors to directly collect the flow-through from the column.",
    "When the sample container is almost empty, return the input tube into buffer A (again pausing the pumps while moving the tube) and restart the pumping with buffer A to transfer the sample from the tubing to the column. Once the entire sample has been loaded, pass 2 CV of buffer A, and then reconnect the column to the detectors.\nFor the sample run, create a folder for data storage.\nOpen the safety shutter and start the SAXS data collection. Verify that the data collection proceeds correctly and double-check that the summed intensity remains constant at the value noted in step 2.2.7 for at least 100 frames.\nUse the \"Single Run\" feature of the HPLC software to start the step-wise gradient programmed in step 2.2.12. For the injection, set the vial number to -1 in order to inject no sample in this step. Write down the number of frames acquired as the program starts.\nOpen \"data acquisition\" in ISPyB20 and press \"Go\" to look at the data set and the automatic analysis21.\nExport the UV data from the HPLC system to ASCII format through the \"Postrun Analysis\" software.\n3. SEC-SAXS Data Reduction & Analysis\nOpen the data in data acquisition in ISPyB by pressing the \"Go\" button. Determine in the overview which frames of the SAXS data collection correspond to the elution peak. Verify that the radius of gyration is stable throughout the peak.\nConfirm that the automated buffer correction was performed correctly. Load frames from the central part of the peak into a program that performs manipulations with experimental SAXS data files22 and average them. Then, load the automatically generated buffer file and check whether the high q regions of the averaged frames and the buffer frames match.",
    "Compare the frames acquired throughout the peak quantitatively using the CORMAP test23.\n\t\nLoad the automatically created subtractions (*_sub.dat files) of frames covering the region of interest.\nScale them to each other by pressing the \"Scale\" button.\nCompare them using the \"Data Comparison\" feature. There should be no systematic changes between the frames throughout the peak.\nOpen all *-_sub.dat frames of interest, merge them using the \"Merge\" button, and save the merged file in .dat format.\nDetermine the radius of gyration with the \"Radius of Gyration\" tool in the program, noting the first data point in the Guinier range for later cropping of the data at low resolution.\nDetermine the pair-distance distribution function with the \"Distance Distribution\" tool in the program and save the resulting .out file as gnom.out.\n4. Ab Initio Modeling\nOn a Unix machine, run a 40 x ab initio model reconstruction program without symmetry restrictions. Create a new folder and copy the gnom.out file to it. Run the program as follows:\n\tfor (( i = 1; i <= 40; i++ )); do dammif gnom.out -m s -p dammifp1_$i; done\nAnalogously, run an ab initio model reconstruction program with symmetry restrictions for six-fold symmetry in a second folder:\n\tfor (( i = 1; i <= 40; i++ )); do dammif gnom.out -m s -s P6 -p dammifp6_$i; done\nAlign all ab initio model reconstruction program output files (*-1.pdb). In the two folders from steps 4.1 and 4.2, run damaver -a *-1.pdb.\nOpen the union of all models (damaver.pdb) as well as the model filtered to the correct volume (damfilt.pdb) in a suitable molecular visualization software26 and compare them.\nOpen the damsel.log file in a text editor. The model listed as the \"reference\" at the bottom of the file is the most representative model.",
    "5. IEC-SAXS Data Reduction, Analysis, and Modeling\nIn the program that performs the manipulation with experimental SAXS data files22, load about 50 SAXS frames from each mixing step of the buffer run, press the \"AVERAGE\" button, and save the results.\nBased on the auto-processing results available via ISPyB, identify which frames of the experiment correspond to the elution of the protein and verify that the (preliminary) radius of gyration is stable throughout the peak.\nLoad the frames into the experimental SAXS data files manipulation program22 and average them, as done for the buffer frames (see step 5.1). Then, load the buffer files generated in step 5.1 and compare the high q regions (above 4.2 nm-1) to find a buffer that matches the average from the peak.\n\tNOTE: There should be no systematic offset between the average from the peak and the buffer. If the sample curve seems to fall between two buffer curves, interpolate their curves by calculating the average.\nSubtract the buffer identified as the best match from the average scattering curve of the peak fraction and save the resulting subtracted file. In addition, create subtracted curves using the average buffer curves from the preceding and following mixing steps to estimate the error margin of the subtraction.\nRepeat steps 5.3 and 5.4 individually for the left and right halves of the peak and compare the results to those from step 5.4 to check for stability of the signal throughout the peak.\nFollow steps 3.5 and 3.6 for all three subtracted curves from step 5.4.\nCompare the results for all three subtracted curves.\n\tNote: Only results that remain robust within the error margin of subtraction can be trusted.\nPerform modeling as in steps 4.1 and 4.2 for the best subtraction identified in step 5.3.",
    "Follow step 4.3 to 4.5 to align the models and to identify the most representative one.\n6. Comparison of the Results\nRun a program to superimpose 3D structures12 on the representative models of the SEC (step 4.5) and IEC-SAXS data (step 5.9) with P6 symmetry: supcomb model_sec.pdb model_iec.pdb\nImport the model_sec.pdb and the model_iec-r.pdb into a molecular visualization software.\nOpen the .fir files of the modelsec.pdb and the modeliec-r.pdb in a spreadsheet and create a 2D graph of experimental and calculated scattering curves."
