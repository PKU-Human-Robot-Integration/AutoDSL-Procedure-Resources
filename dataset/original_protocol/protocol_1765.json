    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nLibrary amplification on non-selective plates—Day 1\nTiming: 3 h\nEach plate of the reporter-containing YKO library is replica-pinned onto several non-selective plates in order to analyze multiple colonies per strain. For every position of the array, a colony will grow on the last plate of the pinning procedure if the low-frequency event occurred at that position, otherwise no colony will be present. Analysis of several independent colonies per strain allows us to calculate the fraction of colonies in which the desired low-frequency event occurred for a specific strain, giving a semi-quantitative estimate of the rate at which a specific low-frequency event occurs in each mutant strain of the YKO collection. Furthermore, this growth step on non-selective medium allows for spontaneous accumulation of the desired low-frequency event (in this case direct-repeat recombination) before the subsequent selection steps.\nReplica-pin each plate of the library (in 1536 format) onto 6 YPD agar plates.\nUse the following ROTOR settings: Source plate: 1536; Target plate: 1536; Pad: short pin 1536; Revisit source: On; Source offset: Manual.\nNote: The number of replica plates at this amplification step is a choice of the user, and depends also on the density format in which the screen is performed. In the example described, 6 plates in 1536 format are a good compromise between analyzing several colonies for each strain (4 colonies × 6 plates = 24 colonies) and using a reasonably small number of plates. Increasing the number of plates could improve the accuracy of the screen, but would also increase the costs and the workload, while reducing the number of plates will reduce the workload and the costs at the expense of accuracy.",
    "Note: In order to have enough cells for pinning onto 6 target plates, it is preferable to touch each time a different region of the source colony with the pin. This can be achieved by manually adjusting the source pinning position using the Source > Offset > Manual option.\nOptional: One source plate is enough for pinning onto 6 target plates. If you need to use more than 6 target plates for library amplification, it is advisable to perform a pre-amplification step, where each library plate is pinned onto 2 target plates, each one serving as a source plate for (max) 6 target plates in the subsequent amplification step. Alternatively, the whole experiment can be performed in parallel with 2 independently constructed sets (named “set A” and “set B”) of the reporter-containing YKO collection.\nIncubate the plates at 30°C for 1 day.\nOptional: In order to increase the number of analyzed colonies and/or reduce the number of plates, the whole screen could be performed in 6144 format (16 colonies per strain on each plate).\nImaging non-selective plates—Day 2\nTiming: 1 h\nImages of the non-selective plates are taken to assess colony size before the selection starts.\nImage all YPD plates with a flatbed scanner using the plate order and orientation shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]. We use a ScanMaker 9800XL scanner (MicroTek International, Inc.), scanning in 8-bit grayscale at 300-dpi resolution with the Transparent Media Adapter.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1354-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Plate orientation for imaging and analysis\nThe plates should be arranged on the scanner in the order and orientation shown on the left (the red dot indicates the A1 position of each plate). Vertical mirroring then generates the image shown on the right, which correspond to the correct input format for ScreenMill Colony Measurement Engine.",
    "Save images as TIFF files with a 300 dpi resolution.\nNote: While saving the images, use a name convention compatible with the ImageJ plugin ScreenMill Colony Measurement Engine (Dittmar et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]), and the script that will be used for data analysis (see steps 11–20).\nIn this case: leuDRscreen1_NSP,1,2,3,4,5,6.tif\nleuDRscreen2_NSP,1,2,3,4,5,6.tif\n[…]\nleuDRscreen14_NSP,1,2,3,4,5,6.tif\nWhere:leuDRscreen = screen ID (should NOT contain numbers)\n1 = plate 1 of the YKO collection\nNSP = non-selective plates (in this case YPD)\n1,2,3,4,5,6 = the 6 parallel replicates of plate 1\nPinning onto selective plates 1—Day 2\nTiming: 1.5 h\nEach plate is replicated once on the proper medium to select for the desired low-frequency events.\nReplica-pin each YPD plate onto one SD-leu agar plate.\nUse the following ROTOR settings: Source plate: 1536; Target plate: 1536; Pad: short pin 1536; Revisit source Off; Source offset: Off.\nIncubate the plates at 30°C for 2 days.\nNote: It is not necessary to take images of this set of selective plates, since the colonies will be very irregular in shape and difficult to analyze.\nPinning onto selective plates 2—Day 4\nTiming: 1.5 h\nSecond round of replica-pinning onto selective plates. This second round is needed to make the selection more stringent and thus obtain clearer results.\nReplica-pin each SD-leu plate onto a new SD-leu agar plate.\nUse the following ROTOR settings: Source plate: 1536; Target plate: 1536; Pad: short pin 1536; Revisit source Off; Source offset: Off.\nIncubate the plates at 30°C for 1 day.\nImaging selective plates—Day 5\nTiming: 1 h",
    "Images of the selective plates are taken to assess colony size after the selection for the desired low-frequency events. The rationale here is that, at each position, a single low-frequency event that occurred during the non-selective growth (or before) will result in a fully grown colony, while if no event happened at that position the colony will not grow at all.\nImage all plates from the second round of SD-leu selection with a flatbed scanner, using the same plate order and orientation as in step 3.\nSave images as TIFF files with a 300 dpi resolution.\nNote: While saving the images, use the same name convention as before, where “NSP” is substituted with “SP” (= selective plates).\nIn this case: leuDRscreen1_SP,1,2,3,4,5,6.tif\nleuDRscreen2_SP,1,2,3,4,5,6.tif\n[…]\nleuDRscreen14_SP,1,2,3,4,5,6.tif\nImage analysis\nTiming: 3 h\nColony area is measured using the ImageJ software package (Schneider et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]) and the ImageJ plugin ScreenMill Colony Measurement Engine (Dittmar et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Colony area at each position is needed to assess the presence or the absence of a colony during the automated data analysis (see data analysis and frequencies calculation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.7]).\nNote: Contrary to what happens in fitness-based screens, differences in colony size (due, for instance, to the position of the colony on plate or the size of the neighboring colonies) are not a problem in this protocol, because the final output that is scored is essentially binary (colony or no colony).\nNote: The ImageJ plugin ScreenMill Colony Measurement Engine can be found here https://sourceforge.net/projects/cm-engine/[href=https://sourceforge.net/projects/cm-engine/]. The plugin file (cm engine_ImageJ1.63.txt) should be saved in the “macros” folder of ImageJ.\nInstall the ImageJ plugin ScreenMill Colony Measurement Engine as a macro.\nPlugins>Macro>Install.\nSelect the file “cm engine_ImageJ1.63.txt” from the macros folder.\nOpen the Colony Measurement Engine.\nPlugins>Macro>ScreenMill - CM Engine [c].",
    "Choose Parent Directory: select the folder containing the images of the non-selective plates.\nUse the following setting from the “Screen Information” menu.\nFine-crop mode: Automatic.\nColony measurement method: Standard.\nPlate density: 1536.\nFile name to save measurements to: chose the file name you prefer (for instance “leuDRscreen_NSP_colonyAreas”).\nRunning mode: Standard.\nRepeat the same procedure to quantify the images of the selective plates.\nNote: During the image analysis, you are occasionally asked to verify (and adjust) the plate fine cropping, and to verify and manually remove possible artifacts on the plate (such as scratches or contamination) that interfere with colony quantification. Please follow the instructions from the pop-up windows to adjust the cropping and remove artifacts. For more information, please check the instructions in the electronic supplementary material from Dittmar et al. (2010)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4].\nOptional: It is also possible to analyze the images from non-selective plates and selective plates at the same time by placing NSP and SP image files in the same folder (steps 11–14).\nData analysis and frequencies calculation\nTiming: 15 min\nThis section describes an automated script to analyze the raw colony size dataset. The working script calculates the frequency of SP/NSP colonies for each strain, and generates an Excel file containing a ranked list of genes according to this frequency.\nDownload the High-Throughput Replica Pinning script available on GitHub: https://github.com/Chang-ERIBA/Protocol_HTRP[href=https://github.com/Chang-ERIBA/Protocol_HTRP]\nNote: This R script will require the following packages alongside with R-version 3.6.3 or later (for more information please check the Readme file in GitHub Repository):\ntidyverse (version 1.3.1)\noptparse (version 1.6.6)\nopenxlsx (version 4.2.4)\nOpen a “Terminal” in the working directory where the scripts High_Replica_Pinning_Tools.R and High_Replica_Pinning.R are present.\nTo execute the program, paste the following command:\nRscript High_Replica_Pinning.R -i <Inputfile> -k <Keyfile> -O <Output_Dir> --Filter <filterValue> --Median_NSP <MedianRatioNSP> --Median_SP <MedianRatioSP>",
    "Fill in the required input files and parameters.\nRequired input files: <Inputfile>: File with the colony areas data. Generated in the section image analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.6] (steps 11–15).\nNote: If the image analysis (steps 11–15) was performed separately for NSP and SP plates, you need to combine the two output .txt files into one single file by simply copying and pasting the content of one file to the bottom of the other.\n<Keyfile>: library Keyfile in .csv and 384 format.\nNote: The library Keyfile must contain the following columns:\nPlate #: Numbers Row: Letters from A to P Column: Numbers from 1 to 24 ORF: Systematic names of S. cerevisiae genes Gene: Gene names Mutation (optional; if present, it will be used to group and calculate “Total colonies” at the “Grouped” tab in the final document: see step 20).\nNote: If the column Mutation is absent, the grouping will be by ORF and Gene. If the column Mutation is present (such as in the temperature-sensitive collection, where different mutations can be present for the same gene, and the same mutant might be repeated at different positions of the collection), the grouping will be by ORF, Gene and Mutation.\nOptional parameters:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1354_1.csv\nNote: The number of colonies that pass the threshold is reported in column “colonies_NSP” in the final Excel file.\n<MedianRatioSP>: Numeric value between 0 and 1 that indicates the percentage of the NSP colony size median used as a size threshold to calculate the number of colonies on selective plates. By default, the value is 0.2 (i.e., only colonies with a pixel area greater than 20% of the median NSP pixel area will be scored).\nNote: The number of colonies that pass the threshold is reported in column “colonies_SP” in the final Excel file.",
    "Note: The default <MedianRatioSP> is smaller than the default <MedianRationNSP> because colonies on SP plates are often smaller than on NSP plates.\nRun the script. This will generate one Excel file named:\n<ColonyFileName>_<MedianRatioNSP>_<MedianRatioSP>_<filterValue>_<Date>.xlsx\nThe file contains the following tabs:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1354_2.csv\nNote: If the collection keyfile contains a “Mutation” column (as in the temperature-sensitive collection), the list will be grouped by ORF, gene and mutation names.\nNote: The Readme file of the script contains two examples of how to use the script with a test dataset available in the script repository website."
