    "NOTE: Follow all institutional regulations regarding the safe use and disposal of radioactive material, including but not limited to, usage of personal protective equipment, such as gloves, safety glasses, lab coat, and appropriate acrylic shields.\nNOTE: The standard buffer consists of 40 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mM potassium glutamate, 5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA (this buffer is pre-made at a 5x concentration) and 0.3 mM of each dNTP. T7 replication proteins are purified as described8,9,10. Single-stranded DNA containing a single T7 primase recognition site (5'-GGGTC-3', 5'-GTGTC-3', 5'-TGGTC-3') can be purchased from a variety of DNA synthesis companies (the length of the ssDNA may depend on the enzyme of choice, for T7 primase, a pentamer is the minimum template length to synthesize a full-length primer11, as the cryptic C is essential, however, if the primer is to be extended by polymerase, additional nucleotides must be present at the 3' end of the template. Reactions are initiated by the addition of a final concentration of 10 mM MgCl2 and incubated at 25 °C. Manual sampling works well for time-points of 5 seconds or greater. If time-points shorter than that are required, it is recommended to use a rapid-quench flow instrument to obtain accurate data.\n1. Multiple-turnover Primer Synthesis Reaction by Manual Sampling\nBefore starting the experiment, aliquot 2 µL of formamide dye buffer (93% (v/v) formamide, 50 mM EDTA, 0.01% xylene cyanol and 0.01% bromophenol blue) into 8 1.5 mL polypropylene tubes. In general, the number of tubes is equal to the number of time-points analyzed.\nPrepare a 20 µL mixture consisting 1x buffer, 0.1 mM ATP and CTP, 0.25 mCi/mL [α-32P] CTP, 0.1 µM ssDNA template, and 0.1 µM gp4 (expressed as hexamer concentration — 0.6 µM monomer).\nIncubate the mixture at room temperature for 5 min.",
    "Remove 2 µL of the mixture using a pipettor and mix with 2 µL formamide dye buffer in a 1.5 mL tube prepared in step 1.1 for the no reaction control (time zero).\nAdd 2 µL of 0.1 M MgCl2 to reaction mixture (to a final concentration of 10 mM).\nManually withdraw 2 µL samples of the reaction mixtures using a pipettor at 10 s intervals and mix with formamide dye predispensed in 1.5 mL tubes prepared in step 1.1.\nHeat samples at 95 °C for 5 min in a heat block.\nLoad aliquots of the samples onto a denaturing gel. The small tetraribonucleotide primer products synthesized by the T7 primase are resolved well on a 0.4 mm thick 25% acrylamide:bisacrylamide (19:1), 3 M urea, 1x TBE (100 mM Tris-borate, 1 mM EDTA).\nPlace entire gel on chromatography paper and cover with plastic wrap. Dry gel using a gel drier.\nPrepare a dilution series of the remainder of the reaction mixture and spot the same volume loaded on the gel onto chromatography paper, i.e., spot 4 µL of the dilution if 4 µL of sample were loaded.\nNOTE: This will serve as the standard curve to determine the concentration of products formed during the reaction. For example, five-fold dilutions using TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA) work well, spanning a range of 1:25 to 1:15,625 (52-56), but the dilutions should be adjusted depending on the level of activity.\nExpose dry gel and standard using a phosphorimager screen. Quantify the radioactivity in the dilution series and construct a standard curve as described 8,12",
    "NOTE: Inclusion of T7 DNA polymerase to the reaction mixture allows one to examine the usage of tetraribonucleotide primers by this enzyme. Optimally, the polymerase concentration should be saturating to simplify the interpretation of the data. A polymerase concentration of 0.4 µM or higher gives good results. Additionally, the effect of other proteins, such as single-stranded DNA binding proteins, on either primer synthesis or lagging-strand initiation can be examined in this manner.\n2. Multiple-turnover Primer Synthesis Reaction Using a Rapid-quench Instrument\nPreparation of reaction mixtures\nPrepare 400 µL of solution A, containing 1x buffer, 0.2 µM gp4 hexamer, 0.2 µM ssDNA template, 0.6 mM dNTPs, 0.2 mM ATP and CTP (including 0.5 mCi/mL [α-32P] CTP.\nPrepare 400 µL of solution B, containing 1x buffer and 20 mM MgCl2.\nOperation of rapid-quench flow instrument\nTurn on rapid-quench flow instrument; after the main menu appears, type 7 on the instrument keyboard to move the syringe driver to the home position.\nOpen buffer syringe position to \"LOAD\".\nLoading buffer syringes\nAttach a 10 mL syringe containing buffer to the drive syringe port. Change syringe knob position to \"LOAD\".\nUsing 10 mL syringes, fill instrument buffer reservoir A and B with 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA and fill syringe C with quench solution (250 mM EDTA, and 0.2% SDS). Remove air bubbles by pushing plungers in and out.\nChange knob positions to \"FIRE\". Type 2 to adjust position of the syringe driver bar. Press \"ADJUST DOWN\" button to lower the syringe until buffer comes out the exit loop: (7-goes down continuously; 8-large step down; 9-small step down). Type \"ESC\" to return to the main menu.\nWash tubing",
    "Attach exit line to vacuum. Change sample knobs to \"FLUSH\". Close buffer syringe by setting the knobs to the horizontal position. Turn on vacuum and dip the 2 flush loops in H2O for 10 s, then dip in MeOH for 10 s. Dry loops by sucking air for ~15 s, or until dry.\nLoading samples\nChange sample knob position to \"LOAD\". Place solution A into 1 mL syringe. Plug syringe into one of the sample load ports. Repeat for solution B, and place in opposite sample load port.\nCollection of time-points\nOn main menu, type 1 for quench-flow run. Enter reaction time (s) and press, \"ENTER\". The reaction loop number to use will be displayed. Switch to required reaction loop. Repeat wash procedure in step 2.2.4.\nTurn sample knobs to \"LOAD\". Load reaction mixes in sample loops until just outside the central mixing compartment. Turn all knobs to \"FIRE\". Confirm that all knobs are in the correct position.\nPlace 1.5 mL tube onto end of exit loop. Press \"GO\" to run the reaction. Repeat wash procedure in step 2.2.4. Reload buffer syringes A and B until they hit the driver.\nRepeat steps 2.2.6.2-2.2.6.3 for each desired time point. Exception: Don't load solution containing the start reagent (i.e., MgCl2 in this case) when quenching the zero time-point control.\nWhen finished collecting samples, enter \"ESC\" to return to main menu. Press \"7\" to return buffer syringe driver to its home position.\nInstrument clean-up\nRemove reaction mixture syringes. Turn sample loading knob to \"LOAD\" position. Under vacuum, wash each sample loop with 10 mL 0.2 N NaOH, followed by 10 mL 0.3 N H3PO4 and 10 mL MeOH.",
    "Turn syringe knobs to \"LOAD\" position. Press down on all 3 syringe plungers to retrieve reaction and quench buffers. Wash syringes with 5 mL H2O at least twice.\nFill syringes again with 5 mL H2O and turn knobs to \"FIRE\" position. Change knob positions and turn on vacuum to remove H2O. Flush as in step 2.2.4. Turn off instrument.\nNOTE: Products are analyzed as described in steps 1.7-1.12. In addition, T7 DNA polymerase and other replication proteins can be added in the reaction mixture to analyze their effect on primer synthesis or extension.\n3. Single-turnover Primer Synthesis Reaction\nNOTE: Single-turnover primer synthesis/extension assays are carried out similarly to multiple-turnover reactions, with a few major differences: these assays follow the conversion of radiolabeled ATP into primer or extension products, however the concentration of substrates and proteins are considerably higher. In addition, in order to attain millisecond resolution to allow analysis of the primer synthesis reaction, one must utilize a rapid-quench flow machine.\nPreparation of reaction mixtures.\nPrepare 400 µL of solution A, containing 1x buffer, 3 µM gp4 hexamer, 6 µM ssDNA template, 0.6 mM dNTPs, 1 mM CTP, and 2 nM [γ-32P] ATP. Prepare 400 µL of solution B, containing 1x buffer and 20 mM MgCl2.\nRapid-quench flow operation\nCarry out reactions as described in step 2.2. If desired, add T7 DNA polymerase or T7 single-stranded-DNA binding protein at a concentration of 15 µM and 20 µM, respectively. In this case, the extension products accumulate at a time regime that allows for manual sampling of the reaction.\n4. Data Analysis",
    "Fit product progress curves to non-linear least-squares models using commercially available software capable of least-squares fits and/or numerical integration. The details of the operation will vary with the software employed, but below are generalized forms of equations used for fitting the data.\nDetermine the rate of product formation of multiple turnover primer synthesis reactions by fitting to progress curves to a linear equation. If there is significant curvature, use the initial rate method13,14 by fitting the data to a single-exponential function: y=A(e-kt ), where y is the product concentration, A is the reaction amplitude, k is the observed rate constant, t is time, in seconds. The slope of the tangent line at time=0 is the initial rate.\n\tNOTE: Fit pre-steady state primer synthesis reactions to a linear equation or to the pre-steady state burst equation y=A (e-kburstt )+ratess t, where A is the reaction amplitude, kburst is the observed rate constant for the pre-steady state burst, ratess is the steady-state ratess =kcat [Enzyme]), t is time, in seconds. Fit single-turnover primer synthesis reactions progress curves to a single-exponential function y=A(e-kt). In the case of gp4, fit the data by numerical integration15, to a model with three NTP condensation steps, where each intermediate is in equilibrium with the enzyme, using commercially available software.\nSubscription Required.
