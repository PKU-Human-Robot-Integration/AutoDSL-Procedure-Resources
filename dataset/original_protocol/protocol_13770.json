    "Experimental procedures were approved by the Regional Laboratory Animal Ethics Committee of Gothenburg, Sweden.\n1. Preoperative care\nUse sterile techniques to avoid infections.\n\t\nUnder anesthesia (e.g., isoflurane) and working in the most aseptic way possible, shave the surgery area and remove the fur with a hair removal cream. Leave the cream for around 1 minute (maximum of 2 minutes to avoid skin-burns). Wash carefully with water. This first step can preferably be done 1-2 days before surgery to avoid extra cooling of the animal right before surgery.\nApply ophthalmic lubricant on the eyes to prevent dryness.\nTo avoid infections, wash the surgical area with antiseptic skin cleanser and wipe the area with disinfectant (chlorhexidine) right before surgery.\nAnalgesia\n\t\nPre-dose the animal with analgesics if it is not a terminal procedure: Buprenorphine (e.g., temgesic) 0.05-0.1 mg/kg s.c.)\nAnticoagulants\n\t\nUse anticoagulants to avoid blood clots: 10 IU of heparin through the tail vein right before surgery (maximum 5 mL/kg).\n2. Surgical procedure\nAutoclave the instruments and use sterile catheters. Have the surgent wash up with soap and hibiscrub and wear a facemask, a hairnet and a sterile surgical gown and gloves. Have a second person handle the animals and all \"dirty\" tasks.\nFor the anesthesia, use isoflurane. Induce anesthesia by placing the mouse in an anesthesia-box with 5% isoflurane. After the induction, check the depth of anesthesia by checking reflexes and breathing.\n\t\nDuring surgery, place a facemask on the mouse to give a maintenance dose of 2% isoflurane.\nWash the animal with hibiscrub and chlorhexidine before putting on the surgical table.",
    "After anesthetizing, place the mouse on a heated surgical pad in a supine position and fix the upper and lower limbs to the pad using low-tack adhesive tape. Ensure that the upper extremities are maintained in a normal position to prevent lung compression. If possible, use a non-electric heat source.\n\tNOTE: We use inhalation anesthesia (e.g., isoflurane) for easier adjustments during surgery.\nDrape the mouse with plastic wrap (e.g., Press´n Seal) and perform the work with a surgical microscope.\nProtect the tissues from drying by constantly adding saline into the surgery area. This also helps keeping the tissue elastic and minimizes risk of damage while performing the surgery. The saline should be around 37 °C to avoid cooling of the animal.\nAfter opening the abdominal cavity with a midline incision with forceps and scissors, use a moist, folded, compress to push all other organs aside to get a good view over the surgery area.\nUse retractors to have a good overview of the surgery area (5 mm blunt hook).\nLocalize the aorta and the left kidney.\nUsing two microsurgery forceps, gently clean the aorta, both cranially (see 2.10.1) and caudally (see 2.10.2) fromthe kidney, from surrounding tissues and place a ligature underneath it (6-0 Silk). Be careful not to pinch any structures. Work your way in by gently stretching and pulling the tissues, getting as close to the renal artery as possible. Around the vessels there are several nerves not easily discovered. Keep this in mind since damaged nerves can cause paralysis or other issues post operatively.",
    "Cranially (above) the kidney, use this ligature to lift the aorta to momentarily occlude the blood flow while performing the injection. In this position, right above where the renal artery, the aorta branches in the opposite direction (to the intestines, see Figure 1). In order to avoid pushing the injection this way, put the ligature beneath this branch. Leave the ligature without any tension until starting the injection procedure.\nCaudally (below) the kidney, place the incision close to where the aorta branches to the kidney/renal artery to avoid other potential branches. Caudally from the kidney the aorta is very close to the abdominal vein. Be very careful not to damage the vein.\nInjection\n\t\nWhen all ligatures are in place; first stretch the lower and secondly the upper ligature to occlude the blood stream to direct the injected fluid to the kidney.\nUsing an acupuncture needle (Ø 0.25 mm), puncture and guide the (rounded) tip of the catheter (32GA) into the aorta and secure it with a single knot on the ligature so that it will not move or leak during injection. (Figure 1). Using an acupuncture needle instead of a scissor enable the making of a minimal entry hole in the vessel.\nInject 50 µL of fluids. The kidney should turn pale, indicating that the injection has perfused the kidney and ended up in the destined place.\nAt this point there are two different scenarios possible.\n\t\t\nGive some circulation back to the kidney by carefully loosen the tension in the upper ligature before closing the entry hole. This way ischemia is ameliorated but be aware that the injected fluid can potentially be cleared rapidly via the renal vein and thus not allowing enough dwell time.\nOr proceed with surgery without giving blood flow back.",
    "After tightening the upper ligature again, withdraw the catheter, suture the aorta and give back full circulation.\n\t\t\nRemove the ligature holding the catheter.\nWithdraw the catheter.\nSuture the entry hole with a single stitch (ethilon 11-0, rounded needle).\nFirst loosen the lower ligature and then very slowly loosen the upper one. If there is leakage tighten the ligature again, wait for a few seconds and try again. Keep the total ischemia time to a maximum of 5-10 minutes to avoid ischemic damage.\nTest the solidity by pushing the area and look for pulsations and see to that the kidney returns to \"normal coloring\" to reinsure that recirculation is established.\nCut the threads and remove the ligatures underneath aorta.\nRemove the compress and push the intestines back in place. Give back some fluids, by adding saline into the abdominal cavity and suture the peritonea (Vicryl 6-0) before closing the skin with metal clips.\nBefore waking up the animals are given 0.7-1 mL of Rehydrex subcutaneously.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: The whole procedure takes around 30-45 minutes for a well-trained surgent.\n3. Postoperative care\nAllow animals to wake up in a warm environment by placing a heating pad (around 38 °C) underneath part of the cage for 2-3 days post operatively.\nContinue providing analgesia (Buprenorphine, e.g., temgesic 0.05-0.1 mg/kg s.c.) 2-3 times/day for 3 days post operatively.\nGive 10 mL/kg of Rehydrex s.c. occasionally if animals show signs of dehydration."
