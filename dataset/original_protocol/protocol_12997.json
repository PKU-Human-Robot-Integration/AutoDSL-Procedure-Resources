    "1. Loading the specimen holder for liquid-EM\nClean the silicon nitride (SiN) microchips by incubating each chip in 150 mL of acetone for 2 min followed by incubation in 150 mL of methanol for 2 min. Allow chips to dry in laminar airflow.\nPlasma clean the dried chips using a glow-discharge instrument operating under standard conditions of 30 W, 15 mA for 45 s using Argon gas.\nLoad a dry base microchip into the tip of the specimen holder. Add ~0.2 µL of sample (0.2-1 mg/mL of virus assemblies in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 10 mM MgCl2; 10 mM CaCl2) to the base chip. Following a 1-2 min incubation step, place the top chip on the wet base chip containing the sample.\nClamp the assembly together to form a hermetically sealed enclosure, held in place mechanically by three brass screws. Upon sealing the assembly, pump the tip to 10-6 Torr using a turbo-pumped dry pumping station. The holder is now ready to be inserted into the TEM.\n\tNOTE: The select holder has no cooling capabilities and is not used for cryo-EM.\n2. Production of microchip sandwich assemblies\nNOTE: Different SiN or silicon dioxide (SiO) microchips can be used directly from the shipped gel packs. Carbon-coated gold grids may also be used directly as supplied.\nPlasma clean the microchips and carbon grids using a glow discharge instrument operating under standard conditions of 30 W, 15 mA for 45 s using Argon gas.",
    "Add ~2 µL of sample contained in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 10 mM MgCl2; 10 mM CaCl2 to a glow-discharged microchip placed on a gel pack. Remove excess solution (~50%) using a filter paper or a pipette. Following a 1-2 min incubation step, add the glow-discharged carbon grid to the wet microchip containing the sample.\nClamp the assembly together using a single-tilt specimen holder or autoloader grid clips at room temperature to form a hermetically sealed enclosure. For the auto-loader clamps, place the sandwich assembly on the bottom C-clip, place the top clip on top of the assembly and use the standard clamping tool to seal the assembly together.\n\tNOTE: The clamping procedure performed here uses the same steps as for cryo-EM grid clamping, but at room temperature. Clamped samples may be stored for 2 months or longer prior to imaging while maintaining liquid in the enclosure. No leak check is used with a room temperature specimen holder or the autoloader.\nThe specimen is now ready to be inserted into the TEM. Examine samples placed in autoloaders under cryo conditions or at room temperature.\n3. Imaging specimens using a transmission electron microscope\nLiquid-EM imaging\n\t\nLoad the specimen holder into the TEM equipped with a field-emission gun (FEG) and operating at 200 kV.\nTurn on the gun and adjust the eucentric height of the microscope stage with respect to the specimen by using the wobbler function, tilting the sample from -15° to +15° in the column. This procedure adjusts the stage in the Z-direction to accommodate the sample thickness. And helps ensure an accurate magnification during image recording.",
    "Record images as long-framed movies using the in situ package integrated with a direct detector having a pixel spacing of 6 µm (Video 1 and Video 2). Individual images may also be recorded using the serial data collection software package20, implementing automated imaging routines. Acquire images under low-dose conditions at magnifications ranging from 28,000x-92,000x and 40 frames per second.\nAdjust exposure times (0.25-1 s) to minimize beam damage to the specimen. Use a defocus range of -1-4 µm at the specified magnification. If a thick solution is encountered, use higher defocus values or select a different region of interest.\nEnsure the solution is present in the samples throughout the imaging session by focusing the electron beam on a sacrificial area not used for data collection, until bubbles are formed (Supplementary Figure 1).\nCryo-EM imaging\n\t\nLoad the clipped EM grids or microchip sandwiches into the TEM equipped with a FEG and operating at 300 kV. Turn on the gun and adjust the eucentric height of the microscope stage, using a similar procedure described for the liquid-TEM above (step 3.1.2).\nRecord individual images using the single particle analysis system integrated within the microscope system while implementing automated imaging routines. Record images under low-dose conditions using the single particle analysis direct electron detector having a pixel spacing of 14 µm at a magnification of 59,000x and 40 frames per second.\nUse a defocus range of 1-4 µm at the specified magnification. If thick layers of vitreous ice are encountered, use higher defocus values, or select a different region for data collection.\n4. Data analysis and 3 D structure comparisons\nAnalysis of adeno-associated virus (AAV) in liquid and vitreous ice\n\t\nProcess movies for AAV particles in liquid and ice using RELION-3.08 program21 or other image processing software22. Perform motion correction using MotionCor2 v1.2.3.",
    "Once corrected, extract particles using the auto-picking tool in the program software package. Typical box sizes are 330 pixels for liquid specimens and 350 pixels for ice specimens.\nCalculate initial reconstructions using C1 symmetry using the program's 3D initial model routine and/or the ab-initio model options in the data processing software package. In the program, use a regularization parameter of T = 4 and a pixel size of 1.01 Å for liquid specimens and 1.13 Å for ice specimens.\nUse a mask value of 300 Å throughout the refinement procedures. Perform refinement protocols in the data processing software using I1 symmetry to obtain multiple EM maps. Expected structural resolution may be in the range of 4 Å or better. Use particle equivalency implementing icosahedral symmetry at 16,800 for liquid and 15,240 for ice12,14.\n\t\tNOTE: Resolution estimates are based on the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) criteria.\nMask EM maps at ~250 Å and examine results using a molecular structure analysis software package23,24. In Figure 3, slices are shown in increments of ~5 nm.\nExtract capsid protein (VP1) subunits from the EM maps for comparison. Quantify dynamic changes among EM structures based on the particle diameter measurements (Supplementary Figure 2), and then visualize using the Morph map function in the software.\nAnalysis of SARS-CoV-2 sub-viral assemblies in liquid\n\t\nProcess movies using the RELION-3.08 program. Correct for image drift and beam-induced motion using MotionCor2 v1.2.3. Correct for the contrast transfer function (CTF) of the microscope.\nUse the auto-picking tool in the program to select viral assemblies with a box size of 800 pixels. For computational efficiency, extracted particles can be rescaled to 256 pixels. Obtain an initial model using C1 symmetry in the program with a regularization parameter of T = 2 and 1.66 Å pixel size.",
    "Perform 3D refinement in the program to obtain an EM map, an example is shown at ~8.25 Å according to standard FSC criteria (Figure 4). Visualize EM maps using the molecular structure analysis software with slices incremented at 25 nm as demonstrated in Figure 4.\nAnalysis of rotavirus double-layered particles (DLPs) in vitreous ice\n\t\nProcess movies for rotavirus DLPs using other image processing software. Use MotionCor2 v1.2.3 to correct for drift in the images. Use Patch CTF estimation to correct for lens effects on the images.\nExtract particles using the auto-picking tool in the software with a box size of 950 pixels. Down-sample the box size as needed for computing purposes.\nCalculate initial models using ab-initio options and C1 symmetry. Use refinement parameters including a pixel size of 1.47 Å and a mask value of 800 Å.\nPerform additional refinement routines while imposing I1 symmetry. Example results include a 10.15 Å EM map, according to the gold-standard FSC criteria. Total particles used were 2050, which equates to 123,000 protomer units due to the icosahedral symmetry operator (Figure 5).\nMask final maps at ~750 Å and visualize results in the molecular structure analysis software package. Example slices through the EM map are shown in Figure 5 in increments of ~10 nm.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
