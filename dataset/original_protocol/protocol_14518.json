    "Mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory and kept in a pathogen-free vivarium in the UCLA Division of Laboratory Animal Medicine (DLAM). The experiments were performed according to the approved institutional guidelines from the Chancellor's Animal Research Committee (ARC#2016-037).\n1. Mouse Anesthetization\nUse eight-week-old female C57/BL6 mice (n = 3).\nAnesthetize the mice using ketamine (80-120 mg/kg of mouse weight)/xylazine (5 mg/kg of mouse weight) solutions and administer intraperitoneally (ip) at a dose of 10 mL/kg.\nPrepare ketamine (80 - 120 mg/kg)/xylazine (5 mg/kg) solutions and administer them intraperitoneally (ip) at a dose of 10 mL/kg.\nConfirm that the mice are fully anesthetized by performing a toe pinch.\n2. Pulp-capping Procedure\nPlace the mouth holder in the mouse's mouth.\nSecure the mouth holder on the table such that the head is facing upward.\nPlace the microscope (10X) on top of the mouth so that the first maxillary molar is fully visible.\nUsing the ¼-round bur in a high-speed handpiece at 200,000 rpm, remove the enamel part of the tooth in the middle until the pulp is visible through the transparent dentin. Do not expose the pulp with the bur.\nUsing a #15 endodontic K-file (diameter of 150 µm), perforate through the dentin and expose the pulp.\n\tNOTE: Special care should be taken so that the dentin debris does not get pushed into the pulp. This can be avoided by rotating the K-file quarterly and then pulling the K-file out.",
    "Mix MTA with sterile H2O according to the manufacturer's instructions. Deliver and place the MTA onto the exposed pulp with the tip of the explorer. Use the back side of the paper point (fine) to pack the MTA into the exposed pulp by gentle tapping. The thicker side of the paper point is flat and therefore allows for the proper condensation of the MTA into the exposed pulp.\nEtch the tooth for 15 s by placing the 35% phosphoric acid etchant where it just covers the tooth. Take special care to limit the placement of the etchant, as it may irritate gingival tissues.\n\tNOTE: The etchant comes in a syringe and is used to roughen the tooth surfaces so that dental adhesives can flow in to mediate micromechanical bonding onto the tooth. Because they are viscous, it can be self-contained by applying small amounts directly onto the tooth.\nUse negative-pressured suction to remove the etchant. Use a cotton pellet that is lightly soaked with H2O to remove the residuals of the etchant. Repeat this step until the etchant is completely removed from the tooth.\nUsing a compressed air duster, gently dry the tooth.\nApply the dental adhesives using the backside of the paper point.\nMake the adhesive layer thin using compressed air for 3 s.\nCure the dental adhesives for 20 s using the curing-light unit.\nPlace the flowable composite in small amounts onto the tooth that was capped with MTA. Use the tip of the explorer to flow the composite into the tooth grooves.\nCure the composite for 30 s using a light-curing unit to polymerize it. Confirm that the composite is fully cured and hard using the explorer.\n3. Post-op Care\nAdminister carprofen (5 mg/kg) subcutaneously (sc) immediately after the pulp-capping procedure.",
    "Place the mice on a heating pad at low power to keep the animals warm before they wake up.\nReturn the mice to the vivarium for housing.\n4. Tissue Procurement\nAfter 5 - 6 weeks, euthanize the mice by cervical dislocation under a complete anesthetic condition with isoflurane.\nCarefully remove the maxilla out of the base of the skull and put it into a 50-mL tube. Fix the entire maxilla that contains both the pulp-capped tooth and the contralateral uncapped tooth in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, at 4 °C overnight, and then store it in a 70% ethanol solution.\n\tNOTE: Paraformaldehyde is toxic and carcinogenic. The proper use paraformaldehyde should be monitored as outlined in the standard operating procedures (SOP).\nScan the mouse maxillae using the µCT scan. To secure the maxillae during scanning, wrap the samples with gauze soaked with 70% ethanol and place them in the 15-mL cell culture tube.\n5. µCT Scanning\nPrepare the samples for µCT scanning. Briefly, wrap the samples with gauze soaked with 70% ethanol and secure them in a generic 15-mL cell culture conical tube. Mount the tube onto the µCT scanning stage, as outlined in the manufacturer's instructions.\nSet the X-ray source to a current of 145 µA, a voltage of 55 kVp, and an exposure time of 200 ms.\nPerform image acquisition with the µCT scanner at a 20-µm resolution and with a 0.5 mm Al filter.\nReconstruct the image and visualize it11.\nOnce the µCT scan is complete, start decalcification with 5% EDTA and 4% sucrose in PBS (pH 7.4) for 2 weeks.\n6. Tissue Processing and Staining",
    "Embed the decalcified tissues in paraffin. Before embedding, trim the maxilla by making a sagittal cut immediately anterior to the first molar. While embedding, position this surface downward, such that the longitudinal section of the first molar is the cutting surface.\nUsing the microtome, prepare 5 µm-thick slides. The pulp-capping areas usually coincide with the distopalatal (DP) root, which can be used as a landmark. Determine the precise area of interest by examining the histology under the light microscope and comparing the µCT images.\nFor H&E staining, deparaffinize and rehydrate the slides with xylene (2x) and serially diluted ethanol (100% EtOH 2x, 95% EtOH 2x, and 70% EtOH 1x).\nRinse the slides with running tap water.\nStain with Hematoxylin solution for 2.5 min and rinse with tap water.\nDip the slides in 95% ethanol for 1 min.\nStain with Eosin solution for 1 min and rinse with tap water.\nDehydrate with serially diluted ethanol (70% EtOH 1x, 95% EtOH 2x, and 100% EtOH 3x) and xylene (3x).\nMount the slides with mounting solution.\nSubscription Required.
