    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCell sorting\nTiming: 3 days to few weeks\nDuring this step cells are fixed and sorted based on DNA content. Depending on the number of cells, their cell cycle distribution, and how much chromatin you will need, this step can be repeated as needed and samples pooled together (this explains the broad range in timing).\nSeed 2.5 × 106 RPE in four 15 cm2 plates for 48 h.\nNote: cells need to be at ∼70% confluence when harvested.\nTreat the cells with Hoechst 33342 adding 1/1,000 directly on the medium, swirl to mix and incubate the cells at 37°C for 1 h. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: incubation time will need to be adjusted depending on the growth rate of the cells (30 min for HEK293T for example).\nNote: Hoechst can be toxic for certain cells, after incubation if cells look different (i.e., rounded) less Hoechst should be used.\nShake off the loosely attached mitotic cells by tapping the side of the plates. Collect the medium in 50 mL conical and centrifuge in order to pellet the cells in mitosis that could be less adherent. Transfer the spun medium in another tube as it will be used in steps 5 and 9, leave enough medium behind to make sure not to aspirate the pelleted mitotic cells.\nRinse the cells with 1× PBS and add 2.5 mL of trypsin per 15 cm2 plate.\nNote: a single cell suspension is critical for the sorting.\nResuspend the cells in the spun medium from step 3, for four 15 cm2 plates use 36 mL of medium, transfer in the 50 mL conical tube containing the pellet of mitotic cells.\nCrosslink the cells by adding 1 mL of 37% formaldehyde to the medium (1% final), incubate at 37°C for 13 min.",
    "Note: formaldehyde should be freshly opened and is toxic, use gloves and dispose properly.\nStop the fixation by adding 3.7 mL of glycine 1.25 M pH 2.5 (0.125 M final), incubate for at least 2 min at 18°C–25°C.\nNote: the medium should turn bright yellow.\nCentrifuge the cells, wash the cell pellet with 1× PBS and centrifuge again.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 2 mL of spun medium from step 3.\nNote: the sorting step is more efficient when the cells have been resuspended in their original medium containing Hoechst, especially if the sorting step takes several hours.\nPlace the cells on ice until sorting.\nNote: fixed cells can be kept on ice for few hours before sorting.\nSort the cells with a BD FACS Fusion using the BV421-A laser. A typical sort is represented in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1498-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Gating example for cell sorting\nGating: place G1 (from the base of the large peak (1N) to 50% of the slope on the right), then G2/M (from the base of the second peak (2N) and encompassing the entire peak), and finally early and late S phase (the S fractions are equally divided in the middle). Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: any sorter with a laser that can read Hoechst can be used. The containers to hold and collect the cells will depend on the sorter.\nNote: all cells are sorted in four fractions and the lysis volume adjusted on the number of cells in step 14.\nNote: The amount of cells needed will depend on the yield of chromatin obtained and on the number of IPs the experimentalist wants to do with the chromatin. Several sorts can be pooled together is necessary.",
    "Transfer the cells to 15 mL conical tubes and centrifuge for 15 min at 1,000 g at 4°C .\nLyse the cells in 200 μL cellular lysis buffer complemented with fresh proteinase inhibitors (cocktail tablets EDTA free), incubate for 5 min on ice, centrifuge for 5 min at 2,000 g at 4°C .\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in nuclear lysis buffer complemented with fresh proteinase inhibitors (cocktail tablets EDTA free), adjusting for the size of the pellet. For an estimated volume we use 10 μL for 300,000 cells, 25 μL for 1 million, 60 μL for 4 million.\nPause point: keep at −80°C (the unsonicated chromatin will be stable for many years).\nSonication\nTiming: 1 day\nDuring this step the collected chromatin will be sheared at an expected size of < 300 pb, roughly one to two nucleosomes and some linker DNA.\nTurn on the QSonica Q800R chiller. Transfer the chromatin in 0.5 mL thin wall PCR tubes. Sonicate according to the time determined in the optimization step.\nNote: sorted cells can be easier to sonicate, therefore, they may need less sonication time. Do not over sonicate as the ChIP will be less efficient. The size will not decrease further but the chromatin will start to be altered.\nNote: the sonication bath should never get hot.\nNote: Steps 16–18 are optional but recommended. While the sonication efficiency should always be the same, we advise to check the sonication every time to make sure that this step worked properly before proceeding to the immunoprecipitation step. During these steps store the remaining chromatin at −80°C.\nAdd 3 μL of chromatin and 1 μL of proteinase K to 65 μL of elution buffer, incubate at 65°C for 4–16 h in a benchtop thermomixer shaking at 1,000 rpm.",
    "Add 65 μL of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol 25:24:1, vortex, centrifuge for 1 min at full speed at 18°C–25°C.\nTake 20 μL of the upper phase, mix with appropriate dye and run on a 1% agarose gel. The chromatin should be under 300 bp. If there is a big tail, the chromatin is not sonicated enough (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nNote: use DNA loading dye with only one tracking color that runs at a high molecular to avoid using a dye running at the same size as your expected chromatin as it hides the chromatin.\nNote: the efficiency of sonication for cells within different cell cycle phases is identical.\nTransfer the sonicated chromatin to 1.5 mL tubes and centrifuge for 10 min at 20,000 g at 4°C to clear the debris. Transfer the supernatant in a clean tube leaving any potential pellet behind.\nNote: cold chromatin (just thaw or kept on ice) can present some SDS precipitates which will be pelleted during the centrifugation. Before proceeding with step 19, leave the chromatin at 18°C–25°C for few minutes to allow SDS to go back into solution.\nNote: we recommend keeping the chromatin in low bind DNA tubes, however regular tubes will work as well.\nNote: the expected chromatin concentration (DNA concentration from Nanodrop) is 300–1,000 ng/μL. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nPause point: keep the chromatin at −80°C (the chromatin will be stable for few years, aliquot to avoid too many freezing/thawing cycles which will deteriorate the chromatin).\nImmunoprecipitation\nTiming: 2 days\nDuring this step, the chromatin will be immunoprecipitated with your antibodies of choice. Some antibodies require specific conditions to work their best. When in doubt, we recommend testing two different dilution IP buffers (low and high triton). We have incorporated a section with the antibodies we tested, and their optimal conditions in the material section.",
    "Prebind the beads with the antibody. In a 200 μL tube: add 100 μL dilution IP buffer complemented with fresh protease inhibitors (cocktail tablets EDTA free), 2.5 μL protein A or G magnetic beads (prewashed and resuspended in dilution IP buffer, protein A for rabbit polyclonal and G for mouse monoclonal antibodies), and 0.2 μg of antibody. Incubate at 4°C for 6 h under rotation.\nNote: PCR strip tubes are useful at this step as they are easier to handle and allow to vortex several tubes at once in this and subsequent steps.\nNote: the incubation time can be increased.\nNote: the amount of antibody can vary depending on efficacy.\nPool the chromatin in a 1.5 mL tube: per IP include 0.5 μg of chromatin in 10 μL of nuclear lysis buffer with fresh protease inhibitors added (cocktail tablets EDTA free), also include 0.5 μg of chromatin for input (if using this to generate baseline input sequencing profiles) and 0.5 μg for pipetting error.\nNote: example for 5 IPs + input + pipetting error: 5 × 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 2.5 μg of chromatin in 5 × 10 +10 +10 = 70 μL of nuclear lysis buffer. Note that the volume of chromatin will be deducted to the volume of nuclear lysis buffer: if 2.5 μg of chromatin represent 5 μL then 65 μL of nuclear lysis buffer will be needed.\nNote: the amount of chromatin per IP can vary, we have used 1 μg for some antibodies (see material section).\nNote: the chromatin concentration is based on DNA concentration taken on a Nanodrop.\nTake 10 μL of the pooled chromatin (diluted in nuclear lysis buffer in the previous step). This will serve as the input, store at 4°C until further use.",
    "Preclear step. Bring the remaining of the pooled chromatin to 100 μL per IP with dilution IP buffer complemented with fresh protease inhibitors (cocktail tablets EDTA free) (low or high triton depending on the IP condition).\nAdd 2.5 μL of protein A agarose beads per IP (prewashed and resuspended in dilution IP buffer), incubate at 4°C for 2 h under rotation.\nCentrifuge and transfer the chromatin in another tube leaving the beads behind.\nAdd 2.5 μL of protein A (or G) magnetic beads per IP (prewashed and resuspended in dilution IP buffer), incubate at 4°C for 2 h under rotation.\nNote: while protein A or G magnetic beads are used accordingly to the antibody that will be used for the IP, protein A agarose are used regardless of the IP. If using protein G for the IP, one could choose to use protein G agarose but this will not improve the preclear.\nQuickly spin down the tubes with beads/antibodies (from step 20) and place them on a magnetic rack before removing the supernatant. Add 100 μL of precleared chromatin per tube, incubate at 4°C for 12–16 h with rotation.\nProceed to the washes. After a quick spin place the tubes on a magnet and remove the supernatant. For each wash, add 100 μL of buffer, vortex thoroughly, spin quickly, place on the magnetic rack and remove the buffer. Perform 6 washes: twice dilution IP buffer, once TSE buffer, once LiCl buffer, twice TE buffer. All washes are performed at 18°C–25°C. Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].",
    "Elution. After the last wash, add 50 μL of elution buffer to the beads, transfer in a 1.5 mL tube, add 1 μL of RNAseA 100 μg/μL and incubate at 37°C for 30 min in a benchtop thermomixer shaking at 1,000 rpm. Add 1 μL of proteinase K (10 mg/mL) and incubate at 37°C for 1 h in a benchtop thermomixer shaking at 1,000 rpm. If pooled chromatin has been kept at 4°C for an input preparation, add 40 μL of elution buffer and proceed as for the IPs from this step.\nNote: if pooling IPs together (see material section) it should be done at that step using 50 μL of elution buffer for all IPs.\nNote: the elution buffer should be less than a month old.\nDecrosslinking. Remove the samples from the beads (quick spin and magnetic rack) and incubate at 65°C for 4 h in a benchtop thermomixer shaking at 1,000 rpm.\nDNA purification. Add 125 μL of Agencourt AMPure XP to both the de-crosslinked IPs and input, incubate them for 10 min at 18°C–25°C, then place them on the magnet and remove the supernatant.\nThe tubes are left on the magnet and 450 μL of freshly prepped 70% EtOH is added, then remove and repeat for a second time.\nThe last step is to wait for the beads to dry on the magnet before resuspending them in 40 μL of H2O. They are then incubated for 1 min at 18°C–25°C before being placed on the magnet. IP or input material is then removed from the beads.",
    "Note: In order to know when the beads are dry, we recommend looking under the light. The beads are dry when they are no longer shiny. However, do not wait longer than needed. If the beads dry too much (the smear against the magnet looks like it is “cracking”) the recovery will be less efficient (see example in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1498-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Examples of AMPure beads ready or not to be resuspended in water for DNA purification\nPause point: keep the DNA at −20°C. The DNA is ready for library preparation or qPCR.\nLibraries preparation for sequencing\nTiming: 1–2 days\nDuring this step the DNA will be prepped to be sequenced with the Illumina technology.\nTo avoid any exogenous DNA contamination work on a clean bench with clean pipetmans and sterile filter tips.\nWe used the TruSeq ChIP Sample Preparation kits and implemented few protocol modifications annotated below. The Illumina protocol can be found here: https://support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/documentation/chemistry_documentation/samplepreps_truseq/truseqchip/truseq-chip-sample-prep-guide-15023092-b.pdf[href=https://support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/documentation/chemistry_documentation/samplepreps_truseq/truseqchip/truseq-chip-sample-prep-guide-15023092-b.pdf].\nWe are annotating the main steps below as an overview, please refer to the guide except when noted otherwise.\nQuantify each ChIP DNA using a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit. We used 1 ng of DNA per library prep (or the entire IP if the concentration is below the threshold of detection). Place each DNA in a well of a 96 well plate and bring the volume up to 50 μL with H2O.\nPerform end repair (page 11 of the Illumina PDF listed above).\nAdenylate 3′ ends (page 14 of the Illumina PDF listed above).\nLigate adapters (page 16 of the Illumina PDF listed above).",
    "Go directly to Enrich DNA fragments step (page 25 of the Illumina PDF listed above) omitting Purify ligation products (we purify using a different method after the PCR step) and stopping at step 5 (page 27 of the Illumina PDF listed above).\nNote: we typically perform 13 cycles of PCR.\nNote: we do not perform the washes step after the PCR, this step is replaced by a double-sided SPRI purification with AMPure beads as noted thereafter.\nAdd 30 μL of AMPure beads to the 50 μL PCR reaction, incubate at 18°C–25°C for 10 min.\nPlace the tubes on the magnetic stand. Keep the sample: transfer 77 μL of the sample in new wells. Discard the beads.\nAdd 12 μL of AMPure beads, incubate at 18°C–25°C for 10 min.\nPlace the plate on the magnetic stand. Discard the sample: take off 80 μL of the sample and discard. Keep the beads.\nPerform two washes leaving the plate on the magnetic stand: add 200 μL of fresh prepped 80% EtOH, remove, repeat and dry the beads (as before, not too much).\nResuspend the beads in 17.5 μL of resuspension buffer, incubate at 18°C–25°C for 1 min.\nPlace the plate on the magnetic stand. Transfer 15 μL of each library in the final plate.\nValidate the libraries using a TapeStation or a Bioanalyzer and proceed to sequencing.\nNote: a typical TapeStation result is presented in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1498-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. TapeStation analyses for a typical ChIP-seq library performed with this protocol\nNote: libraries should yield at a minimum 1,000 ng/mL.
