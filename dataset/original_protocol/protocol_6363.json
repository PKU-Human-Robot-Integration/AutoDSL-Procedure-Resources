    "Arabidopsis thaliana seed sterilizationPlace small portion of seeds (ca. 10 µl) into 0.5 ml Eppendorf tubes.Place open tubes into tube rack inside of desiccator (Figure 2).Add 125 ml of sodium hypochlorite solution into 250 ml glass beaker and place near the seeds.Add 2.5 ml of concentrated HCl into the liquid, which forms chlorine gas, and quickly close the desiccator lid.Sterilize seeds for 3 h.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200108/20200108012823_8143.jpgFigure 2. Photos of (A) open or (B) closed desiccator for seed sterilizationInitial plates preparationAutoclave half-strength MS medium with 0.8% agarose and 0.5% sucrose and pour it into round Petri dishes, let it set.Carefully place sterile Arabidopsis seeds onto agar, using sterile toothpicks, approx. 1 seed per cm2.Seal the plates with tape.Place the plates into fridge for 2-3 days for stratification.Place plates into a plant growth cabinet for 9 days (10 h light/14 h dark; 22 °C, 100 µE m-2 s-1).Preparation of traysMix soil with sterile (autoclaved) sand 1:9 (V/V).Place plastic insert into the tray.Fill inserts with soil-sand mix.Water slightly.Using forceps carefully transfer one seedling per insert, covering roots lightly.Water a bit more, to keep soil moist.Cover tray with the lid.Place trays into plant growth cabinet (10 h light/14 h dark; 22 °C, 100 µE m-2 s-1) for 2 weeks, uncover it after 3 days, and water daily with modified Long Ashton solution.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200108/20200108012856_7728.jpgFigure 3. Photos of (A) Petri dish with seedlings before transfer and (B) trays with Arabidopsis ecotypes ready for material collectionCollection of samples for sulfatase activityCarefully remove plants from soil.Into a 2 ml microcentrifuge tube collect about 1 g of the soil-sand mix, which was closest to the roots of the plant, i.e., rhizosphere, record fresh weight.Collect at least 2 samples per plant.Freeze in liquid nitrogen.Sulfatase activity measurementDefrost the samples in a rack.Add 400 µl of 0.5 M acetate buffer.",
    "Vortex each sample for at least 5 s.Under fume hood add 25 µl of toluene.Close tubes and vortex for at least 5 s.Place tubes into rotating rack for 6 min at 100 rpm.Add 100 µl of p-nitrophenyl sulfate solution under fume hood.Vortex each sample for 10 s.Place tubes for additional vigorous shaking for 5 min in an Eppendorf shaker at 1,000 rpm.Place rack with the tubes into 37 °C incubator for 1 h, mixing the whole rack every 10 min by reversing several times.To stop the reaction under fume hood add 100 µl of 0.5 M CaCl2 solution and 400 µl of 0.5 M sodium hydroxide solution.Vortex each sample for 10 s.Centrifuge tubes at RT at maximum speed for 20 min.Under fume hood carefully transfer the supernatant into plastic 1.5 ml cuvettes.Measure absorption at 400 nm. Use water as blank.Prepare standards by diluting 0, 20, 40, 80, 120, 160, and 200 µl of 10 mM p-nitrophenol standard to 1 ml H2O and measure in the same way.Calculate the p-nitrophenol content of the samples from a calibration curve (standards: 0, 200, 400, 800, 1,200, 1,600, and 2,000 nmol ml-1 p-nitrophenol).Using recorded FW data and incubation time of 1 h calculate sulfatase activity in nmol g FW-1 h-1."
