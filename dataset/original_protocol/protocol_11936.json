    "Third molars used in the study were excised from patients (13-19 years old) with no prior history of drug or alcohol consumption, all non-smoking and with appropriate oral hygiene. On the day of explanation, at the Department of Science Dentistry and Maxillofacial of \"Sapienza\" University of Rome, informed consent was obtained from the patients or the parents. Informed consent was obtained based on ethical considerations and approval of the ethics committee.\n1. Tooth and Dental Pulp Extraction\nPreparation of appropriate medium for the conservation or transportation.\nPrepare Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium low concentration of glucose (DMEM-L) with L-glutamine (494.5 mL).\nAdd 5 mL of penicillin/streptomycin (1%) and 0.5 mL of amphotericin (0.1%).\nExtract the third molar from the patient, quickly rinse it with PBS, put in a 15 mL test tube with the medium and transfer it to the laboratory in less than 2 h.\nUnder a biohazard hood, open the tooth with a cutter by coronal cutting pass parallel and tangent through the roof of the pulp chamber.\nGently remove the pulp with a small excavator and place it in a test tube.\nWash with PBS three times and centrifuge at 2,500 x g for 10 min at RT.\n2. Processing of the Dental Pulp and Stem Cell Release\nRemove the supernatant, resuspend the pellet in Hank's solution and place it in a Petri dish. Incubate for 2 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2.\nType IV collagenase solution preparation.\nPrepare 0.8 mL of DMEM-L.\nMelt 1 mg of type IV collagenase in 0.8 mL of DMEM-L and vortex for several min.\nAdd DMEM-L up to 1 mL to have a final concentration 1 mg/mL.\nFilter the solution with a 0.22 µM filter.",

Stem Cell Culture and Propagation\nEvery day check the culture and, after 3 days of growth, observe different clones of adherent cells within the flask.\nEvery 3 days change the culture medium.\nBetween 7 and 12 days, once the adherent cells have reach confluence, detach them by treating the cells with 1 mL of trypsin-EDTA for 3 min at 37 °C or gently using a cell scraper.\nAdd 4 ml (ratio 1:5) of the culture medium (step 2.5) to stop trypsin action.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension for 6 min at 259 x g, remove the supernatant and place the cells in a T25 flask to propagate.\nNOTE: Every 3 days the cells reach confluence.\nPropagate the cells up to 21 or 28 days (approximately 6-8 passages) to avoid the presence of non-stem like cells in the culture.\nDetach the cells with 1 mL of trypsin-EDTA for 3 min at 37 °C or gently scraping. Centrifuge the cell suspension for 6 min at 259 x g.\nRemove the supernatant and test the cells for cytofluorimetric analysis (step 6).",
    "4. Transient PrPC Silencing by siRNA\nCulture the hDPSCsin 6-well plates (2 x 105 cell/mL) with 2 mL of culture medium (step 2.5) for 24 h.\nThe day after, prepare siRNA PrP medium (400 µL).\nTo a sterile test tube, add 384 µL DMEM-L.\nAdd 1 µL for each type of siRNA PrP to DMEM-L to have a final concentration of 5 nM (4 siRNA PrP were used and verified by the supplier to guarantee a knockdown efficiency ≥70%).\nAdd 12 µL of transfectionreagent to DMEM-L.\nVortex the mixture and incubate for 10 min at RT to allow the formation of transfection complexes.\nAdd 400 μL of siRNA PrP medium to each sample and incubate for 6 h at 37 °C.\nWithout discarding siRNA PrP medium, add 1.6 mL (ratio of 1 to 5) of culture medium (step 2.5).\nLeave the cells for 72 h at 37 °C.\nRemove the supernatant and wash 3 times with 2 mL of PBS at RT.\nAdd 2 mL of neuronal culture medium for 7 and/or 14 days (step 5.1).\nChange the neuronal culture medium every 3 days.\nNOTE: Replace the siRNA PrP solution each time replace the neuronal culture medium.\nAt end of the time, wash 3 times with 2 mL of PBS at RT and test for neuronal surface antigens by Western Blot analysis.\n5. Neuronal Induction Process of hDPSCs\nNeuronal culture medium preparation (500 mL).\nPrepare 444.7 mL of basal media formulated to neuronal cells.\nTo the medium add 50 mL of serum-free supplement used for supporting the long-term viability of embryonic and adult neuronal stem cells (10%).\nAdd 200 µL of basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF) (final concentration 40 ng/mL) and 100 µL of Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) to the medium (final concentration 20 ng/mL).",
