    "Lipid–protein overlay assay In this qualitative assay, lipids are immobilized on a membrane and incubated with tagged protein; any bound protein is then detected by antibodies to the epitope tag (Figure 1 and Figure 5A). We recommend the use of a tag protein (e.g., GST, GFP, or MBP) or a protein without lipid-binding capacity as a negative control for the experiment.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4421/bioprotoc-12-10-4421-g001.jpgFigure 1. Lipid–protein overlay assay. Lipids are immobilized on a PVDF membrane and incubated with the protein of interest. Lipid-bound proteins are detected with western blotting.Dissolve the lipids in pure chloroform to prepare stock solutions (1 mg/mL). Use a Volac Pasteur pipette to mix and transfer the lipid solutions.Store the lipid stock solutions in amber glass vials at -20°C.Cut the PVDF membrane (2 × 8 cm) and mark the spots (at least 1 cm apart) for the lipids.Slowly spot 5 µg of each lipid (5 µL of stock solution) onto the prepared PVDF membrane (at least 1–2-mm diameter) and dry the membrane for at least 30 min to 1 h at room temperature.Place the membrane in the western blot tray (6 × 10 cm) and incubate with 10 mL of blocking solution (TBS containing 3% [w/v] fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin), at room temperature for 1 h with gentle agitation (10 rpm).Discard the blocking solution and incubate the membrane with 60 µg of recombinant His-FT or FT-StII protein in 5 mL of blocking solution at 4°C for 16 h with gentle agitation (10 rpm).Discard the protein solution and wash the membrane with 10 mL of TBS for 5 min; repeat the washes a total of four times.Incubate the membrane with 10 mL blocking solution containing the primary antibody, either antiHis monoclonal antibody or Anti-Strep-tag II monoclonal antibody, at room temperature for 1 h with gentle agitation (10 rpm).",

Calculate the amount of phospholipids needed prior to making stock solutions for the serial dilution analysis. Detailed information, including the molecular weight of phospholipids, can be obtained from the Avanti Polar Lipids website (https://avantilipids.com/[href=https://avantilipids.com/]).In this case, we used DPPG (MW: 744.492 g/mol) and DPPC (MW: 733.562 g/mol). We used serial dilutions of lipids with concentrations of 0, 10, 20, 30, 50, 75, 100, and 150 µM in 200-µL reaction volumes with three technical replicates (from 2 mM stock solution).

Set the total volume to 200 µL (Table 1). The liposome was diluted to concentrations of 0, 10, 20, 30, 50, 75, 100, and 150 µM, as mentioned above.Table 1.
