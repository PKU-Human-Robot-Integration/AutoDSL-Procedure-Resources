    "Note: If possible, generate a single-cell library preparation space in the laboratory. If not, wash the surface of the bench and all the material with RNase Zap at the beginning and end of each library. All material and reagents are handled with gloves and the standard precautions for RNA work should be taken (RNase free material and filter tips). Cell growthOn the day before sorting, grow the desired pre-inoculum of your desired yeast strain in their corresponding media overnight (O/N). To profile exponentially growing cells, we recommend the initial culture not to grow over optical density OD660 = 1.Cell sortingThe next morning (sorting day), dilute cells to OD660 = 0.05 in the corresponding media and allow for at least 2 cell divisions (3 h approximately for wild type strains) prior to cell isolation.Prepare 96- or 384-well plates containing 5 µl absolute ethanol in each well to fix cells immediately for sorting.Notes: During protocol optimization, we recommend using break-away plates. These plates allow breaking 96 well plates by rows, and thus several tests can be done using the same plate. Check with your facility the compatibility of the plates.We have obtained the same results sorting cells directly into 5 µl of “Cell capturing and lysis solution” (see below). If doing so, prepare plates right before sorting and keep them on 4 °C ice. Dilute cells prior to sorting to OD = 0.05 in 3 ml of growth media and vortex vigorously to separate cell clumps.Note: At this step, propidium iodide (PI) (4 µg/ml) can be added to check for cell viability. Adjust the culture volume to your needs. In our experience, 3 ml is enough to sort at least 10 plates.",
    "At the FACS facility, filter cells with Cell Strainer Tubes (check with your facility which tubes they prefer) and put cells in the appropriate sorting tube for live single-cell sorting.Check the alignment of the plate with the sorter. For example, this can be done by sorting a drop into a covered plate, and ensuring that the droplet would fall into the center of each well.Sort live single yeast (propidium iodide (PI) negative) into each well of the plates, being sure to leave one well as a negative control. We index-sorted from the population using the forward and side scatter (FSC and SSC respectively). Note: To include a positive control, sort 100 cells into one well. Cover plates with Universal PCR plate seal.Quick spin plates to collect cells at the bottom of each well (short spin to collect all liquid to the bottom of the wells).Let the ethanol evaporate in a sterile environment (i.e., sterile hood) for no more than 45 min.Once the ethanol is completely evaporated, add 5 µl yeast “Cell capturing and lysis solution”. Spin down and freeze immediately.Note: Regardless of whether the cells are sorted into ethanol or directly into “Cell capturing and lysis solution” (see Recipes), frozen plates can be stored at -80 °C for at least 6 months. ERCCs are spike in RNAs that provide an accurate measure of technical noise, while we recommend using them, they can be excluded. Perform the following lysis cycle from freshly-sorted or frozen plates (Table 1).Table 1. Temperature conditions for cell wall digestion and cell lysisimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190830/20190830010757_6410.jpgNote: Digestion can be extended up to 30 min. Immediately proceed to add the RT reaction for first strand cDNA synthesis. Add 5 µl Reverse Transcription mix (RT mix) (Table 2).Table 2.

Incubation temperatures for cell lysisimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190830/20190830005630_6526.jpgAdd 15 µl PCR mix for library amplification to each well (Table 4).Table 4. Master mix reagents for library amplificationimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190830/20190830005643_4240.jpgSpin down the plate and do the following cycles (Table 5):Table 5. PCR cycling conditions for library amplificationimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190830/20190830005656_0788.jpgNote: This is a safe stopping point (at 4 °C O/N, or frozen -20 °C for 1-2 months).(Optional) Dilute the amplified library 1:20 and check the percentage of positive cells from Step B15 (Figure 1; Tables 6 and 7).Note: Use primers against a housekeeping gene (we use TDH3 but we have obtained same results with ADH1) to measure the number of positive cells per well. Use primers against ERCC as a positive control for amplification that should be even across all reactions. This step is especially useful during the protocol set up as it allows inspecting the samples/libraries before moving forward (check for the number of positive libraries). See Table S1[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20190808/Table%201%20primers%20Protocol%201902586.xlsx] for primer sequences.Table 6. Master mix for qPCR assessmentimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190830/20190830005710_1605.jpgNote: Primer mix refers to the mixture of Fw and Rv primers (10 µM each) diluted in TE 1x.Table 7.

Plates with less than 50% positive cells are rare. To determine if low efficiency is due to sorting or due reaction efficiency, perform a qPCR using a 1:10 dilution of the cDNA library against ERCCs. Failure to amplify ERCCs, or uneven amplification (represented by wildly different Ct values), is indicative of incorrect library preparation.",
    "In the case of low number of positive cells per plate, you can generate a new plate by combining positive from different plates into a new plate before proceeding to tagmentation and try to improve sorting efficiency.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190830/20190830004712_9475.jpgFigure 1. Representative example of Ct Values obtained by qPCR. The scatter plot represents the cycle amplification (Ct value) of a yscRNA-seq 96-well plate. Each dot represents the value obtained using a yeast housekeeping gene (TDH3, x-axis) as a function of the index-sorting value for cell size (Forward Scatter (FSC), y-axis). Dotted line (Ct > 25) displays the threshold used to discriminate positive and negative wells. The label displays the Ct value for the not sorted well H12 (which is used as a negative control). Add 15 µl of room temperature equilibrated and well homogenized Ampure XP beads (1:0.6 sample/ bead ratio) to each well.Note: Do not increase the volume of beads in the purification step above the 1:1 ratio. A less-than-standard amount of beads ensures that primer dimer carryover is minimal. Mix by pipetting up and down ten times, or until the solution appears to be homogeneous. Transfer solutions to a 96-well plate with compatible magnet stand.Incubate the mixture for 10 min at room temperature to let the DNA bind to Ampure XP beads.Place the 96-well plate on the magnetic stand for 5 min, or until the solution is clear and beads have been collected.While samples are on the magnet, carefully remove the liquid without disturbing the beads.Wash magnet-bound beads with 200 µl of 80% (vol/vol) ethanol solution. Incubate the samples for 30 s and then remove the ethanol with the tube in the magnet, do not overdry the beads.",
    "Note: It is important that the ethanol solution is freshly prepared every time, as ethanol absorbs moisture from the environment, thus changing the final concentration. Read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions. Repeat the ethanol wash one more time (repeat Steps B20-B22).Remove any trace of ethanol and let beads dry completely by leaving the plate at room temperature for 5 min or until ethanol evaporates.Note: Cover the plate during this step or protect it from any possible source of contamination or airflows. Once there is no ethanol left, elute dscDNA libraries from Ampure XP beads with 16.5 µl elution buffer at room temperature (EB buffer Qiagen). Remove the plate from the magnet and mix vigorously by pipetting up and down three times or until the solution becomes homogeneous.Place the plate on a magnetic stand and leave it for 2 min, or until the solution appears clear. Recover 15 μl of supernatant from each well and transfer to a new plate. Label the plate correctly, as it will be stored.Safe stopping point: cDNA libraries can be stored at -20 °C before proceeding to tagmentation for up to 2 weeks. Full-length cDNA library quality checkRun 1 µl of dscDNA libraries (Step B28) to check the size distribution and estimate of concentrations using a High Sensitivity DNA ChIP (2100 Bioanalyzer). If available, use the qPCR results from Step B16 to guide the selection of wells for Bioanalyzer (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190830/20190830005302_9141.jpgFigure 2.

    "Left panel (A1) represents the lower limit of library quality that we sequenced while middle (A5) and right (B2) panel represent average libraries (Figure adapted from Nadal-Ribelles et al., 2019)Adaptor annealing: In order to generate cell-barcoded libraries, Tn5 needs to be loaded with double stranded DNA (dsDNA) adapters. To do so, 96 different dsDNA adapters need to be annealed.Thaw the plate with the 96 STRT barcodes (100 µM) in ice.In a new plate, mix 5 μl UMI-TN5-U (100 µM) and 5 μl UMI-TN5_1 to 96 (µM) in TE 1x to final concentration 50 µM (each), a 1:1 dilution.Anneal primers by heating the mix at 95 °C for 3 min and gradually cool down to room temperature (0.5 °C/s). Label the plate as “Annealed cell-specific adapters” plate. Note: Label plates with the amount of annealed primer and the annealing date. Plates can be prepared in advance and stored at -20 °C for up to six months. The amount of annealed adaptors depends on the number of plates that need to be tagmented and the frequency of usage.  To load cell specific adapters to Tn5, prepare a new plate and label it as “loaded Tn5”. In each well, mix the following reagents. We recommend to make a mix with all reagents and add annealed cell-specific adapters individually (Table 8). Table 8. Master mix to generate 10x transposomeimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190830/20190830005756_9168.jpgLoad Tn5 by incubating at 37 °C for one hour and immediately cool to 4 °C. Freeze the “loaded Tn5” plate at -20 °C.Note: Loaded Tn5 plate can be safely stored for 1-2 weeks at -20 °C. Caution, store the plate immediately after use leaving the loaded plate on ice 4 °C will significantly reduce Tn5 activity and will result in inefficient tagmentation.Tagmentation Prepare the following mix in a new plate in ice (Table 9).",

Tagmentation time depends on Tn5 purification efficiency and activity. We have observed that the enzyme loses activity over time. Titration of each batch of Tn5 is strongly suggested by tagmenting the same amount cDNA (Steps B28 and C1) with increasing concentration of loaded Tn5 (Step C6) and check fragmentation profile in a Bioanalyzer.Prepare a 1:20 dilution of MyOne C1 Streptavidin per each sample.Wash MyOne beads 2 x with 2x BWT buffer and dilute with 20x more volume than the original volume of beads with 2x BWT. Example: 20 µl beads for 20 samples will be finally diluted with 400 µl 2x BWT. Add 20 µl of diluted MyOne C1 Streptavidin beads (step C10) to each well and incubate at RT for 5 min at room temperature.Pool all samples per plate (up to 96) into a single collecting tube (1.5 or 2 ml).Place collecting tube in magnetic rack and allow enough time for the solution to be completely clear.While on the magnet, wash beads once with 100 µl of TNT buffer do not mix the beads.While on the magnet, wash MyOne C1 Streptavidin once with 100 µl PB Buffer and discard the supernatant.While on the magnet, wash beads 3 x with 100 µl TNT buffer again and the discard supernatant.Remove 3´ ends Add 100 µl of the following mix to the washed beads from Step C14 (Table 10). Table 10.
