    "1. sgRNA oligonucleotide design\nDesign sgRNAs using online tools such as the Cas-Designer online tool (http://www.rgenome.net/cas-designer/). The PAM sequence is important based on the Cas9 being used. For xCas9, the relevant PAM sequences are NG and the former referred Cas-Designer online tool can generate xCas9 relevant sgRNAs.\n\t\nUse sgRNA design tools that encompass algorithms for on- and off-target prediction (http://www.broadinstitute.org/rnai/public/analysis-tools/sgrna-design)11. A score of 0.2 or greater is preferred.\nSelect up to 3 gene editing targets for an optimum screening (e.g., T1, T2 and T3 were designed for sheep DKK2 exon 1 gene targeting [Table 1]).\n2. Oligonucleotide modification\nTo modify the sgRNA oligonucleotide, delete the 3’-NG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), keeping the protospacer sequence (e.g., starting sequence for T1: TGCCTGCTCCTACTGGCCGC [20 nt]).\nAdd the pentanucleotide CACCG to the 5’-end of the oligo.\n\tNOTE: Upon ligation to the pX330-xCas9 skeleton, this sequence will contain the 3’-end of the U6 promoter motivating sgRNA transcription. The array “CACC” guarantees that the oligo is matching with the overhangs of the BbsI-digested pX330-xCas9 plasmid. The base “G” is a prerequisite of RNA Polymerase III promoters and guarantees the effective startup of sgRNA transcription (e.g., appending the 5’-CACCG array to the protospacer of T1, achieving T1-F: CACCGTGCCTGCTCCTACTGGCCGC [25 nt]). The cleavage efficiency of 21 nt gRNA is significantly different from that of 20 nt gRNA1,12,13,14. It is generally advised to use 20 nt with 5'-G by generating a shorter protospacer, if this is not possible then 21 nt with extra 5'-G can be used.\nCreate a reverse complement (rc) of the protospacer sequence.\n\tNOTE: For example, the rc of the T1 protospacer is GCGGCCAGTAGGAGCAGGCA (20 nt).\nAppend AAAC to the 5’-end of the rc protospacer sequence. Append an additional C to the 3’-end of the rc protospacer.",
    "NOTE: The “AAAC” sequence ensures that the oligonucleotide is suitable for cloning into the BbsI-digested pX330-xCas9 plasmid. The additional“C”on the 3’-end is essential for annealing with the initiating “G” for the sgRNA transcription described above (e.g., AAACGCGGCCAGTAGGAGCAGGCAC [25 nt] is the final oligonucleotide sequence for T1 rc protospacer).\nOrder the oligonucleotides.\n3. Oligonucleotide annealing\nDilute lyophilized oligonucleotides to a final concentration of 10 μM in double distilled water (ddH2O).\nMix forward and reverse oligonucleotides in a thin wall PCR tube maintaning a 1:1 ratio (e.g., 20 μL each) without adding any extra buffer.\nIncubate the mixture at 95 °C for 5 min and then ramp down the temperature to 72 °C for 10 min. Follow with a cooling period at room temperature (RT) consisting of simply removing the sample from the PCR machine and placing it at RT.\n\tNOTE: It is not necessary to phosphorylate the oligonucleotide mixtures to facilitate the ligation.\n4. sgRNA/CRISPR vector digestion\nDigest 1 μg of the selected pX330-xCas9 vector with BbsI (10 units of enzyme per 1 μg of plasmid) for 2 h at 37 °C (Figure 2). Conduct the digestion of the pX330-xCas9 sgRNA expression vector in a total volume of 50 μL, containing 5 μL of 10x digestion buffer and distilled water to achieve the final volume.\nPurify the digested vector by band extraction from a 2% agarose gel under 10 V/cm and subsequently purify using a silica column using a commercial gel extraction kit.\n5. Ligation of the annealed sgRNA oligonucleotides to the expression vector\nMix the annealed sgRNA oligonucleotides (5 μL of the mixture from step 4) with the BbsI-digested pX330-xCas9 vector (purified, 100 ng).\nAdd 1 μL of ligase and 1 μL of 10x ligase buffer.\nAdd distilled water with appropriate volume, up to 10 μL.",
    "Incubate overnight at 4 °C.\n6. Competent cell transformation\nTake out E. coli DH5α competent cells from storage at -80 °C and thaw it on ice.\nAdd 5 μL of the ligation mix to 50 μL of competent E. coli DH5α and keep the mixture on ice for 30 min.\nHeat shock the mixture at 42 °C for 90 s.\nRest it on ice for 2 min.\nRecover the culture on a rotary shaker in 500 μL of LB media for 1 h at 37 °C.\nPlate 200 μL of the culture on an ampicillin resistance LB agarose plate and incubate it overnight at 37 °C.\n7. Identification of the correct recombinant plasmids by PCR\nChoose 5 to 10 bacterial colonies from the LB plate and use each of them to inoculate one 1.5 mL tube containing 1 mL of LB media with 60 mg/mL ampicillin.\nIncubate the tubes on a rotary shaker for 2-3 h.\nCarry out detection of correct recombinant plasmids by using specific primer pairs for the sgRNA oligonucleotides [e.g., forward primer for T1 sgRNA expression vector construction (T1-F): CACCGTGCCTGCTCCTACTGGCCGC, reverse primer (BbsI-R): AAAGTCCCTATTGGCGTTAC, producing a 287 bp amplicon (Figure 3)].\n\t\nPrepare the PCR mixture (Table 2).\nUse the following PCR cycling conditions: 95 °C for 5 min for pre-denaturation; 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s for denaturation, 60 °C for 30 s for annealing, and 72 °C for 30 s for extension. After the 30 cycles are completed, perform a final extension step by heating for 5 min at 72 °C.\nRun the PCR product on a 2% agarose gel under 10 V/cm. A band at the right size [e.g., 287 bp] is considered as positive.\n8. Validate the sequence of sgRNA expression plasmid",
    "Verify the sequence of PCR positive colonies by Sanger sequencing15 using the reverse primer BbsI-R (see step 7.3). This primer anneals at the site downstream of the sgRNA oligo insert. The pX330-xCas9-T1 expressing sgRNA sequence containing protospacer TGCCTGCTCCTACTGGCCGCGG and xCas9 was constructed.\nUse the forward primer T1-F to sequence the positive colonies. The forward one could not give complete sequence information for the site surrounding the insertion site of the sgRNA oligo, because 30-50 bp fragment following the sequencing primer could not be exactly read out.\n9. Construction of dual luciferase reporter vector\nSynthesize 300-500 bp DNA fragments containing the sgRNA targets and subclone it into a dual luciferase reporter vector through double digestion [e.g., subclone 440 bp sheep DKK2 exon1 fragment into pSSA-Dual plasmid16,17 by using double digestion with AscI and SalI, resulting pSSA-Dual-DKK2].\nSynthesize 300-500 bp DNA fragments containing the sgRNA targets. Note that the sequences of the DNA fragments must be parts of the genomic sequences, which could be obtained from NCBI website (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) or related references.\nSelect a suitable dual luciferase reporter vector such as pSSA-Dual16,17 (or two vectors expressing firefly luciferase and renilla luciferase respectively) and then digest this vector and the DNA fragments stated above with two endonucleases such as AscI and SalI.\nFinally ligate these two fragments with T4 DNA Ligase, resulting into pSSA-Dual-Target. Details for double digestion and ligation are displayed in Table 3 and Table 4, respectively. It is worth mentioning that the reporter vector should be amplified in stable bacteria strains (such as Top10), which are recommended to be cultured with lower rotational speed (typically no more than 200 rpm), for the purpose of avoiding DNA recombination.\n10. Cell transfection",
    "Extract endotoxin-free plasmids for vectors stated above. Evaluate the purity and concentration of the plasmids by using suitable instruments. A final concentration of no less than 500 ng/μL and a purity ratio of 1.7-1.9 at absorbance 260/280 nm (A260/A280) are recommended for these plasmids.\nCo-transfect an appropriate cell line such as PIEC18 with the plasmids in equal proportion (e.g., pX330-xCas9-T1: pSSA-Dual-DKK2=1:1, 0.5 μg plasmid for each duplication when using 24 well plate). Use an empty vector such as pX330-xCas9 as a negative control.\n\t\nOne day before the transfection, plate cells in an 24-well culture plate at a density of 2 x 105 cells/well. Cells will be ready for transfection when they achieve a confluence of 60-80%.\nBefore the transfection time point, remove the supernatant as much as possible and gently add 0.5 mL of fresh media for each well.\nDilute transfection reagent in DMEM media at the ratio of 1:25 and mix well.\nPrepare master mix of DNA by diluting 0.5 μg of DNA in 25 μL of DMEM media, and then add 1 μL of P3000 reagent.\nAdd diluted DNA to each tube of diluted transfection reagent (1:1 ratio).\nIncubate for 10–15 min at room temperature.\nAdd 50 μL of DNA-lipid complex to cells.\nIncubate cells for 24 h at 37 °C. Then, analyze transfected cells as in Step 11.\n11. Dual-luciferase detection\nPrepare a sufficient quantity of the 1x passive lysis buffer (PLB) by adding 1 volume of 5x PLB to 4 volumes of distilled water and mix well.\nPassive lysis of cells cultured in 24-well culture plates.",
    "Remove the growth medium from the cultured cells, and gently apply a sufficient volume of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to wash the surface of the culture vessel. Swirl the vessel briefly to remove detached cells and residual growth medium. Completely remove the rinse solution before applying PLB reagent.\nDispense 100 μL of 1x PLB into each culture well to completely cover the cell monolayer. Let the culture plates stand for 20 min.\nTransfer the lysate to a tube or vial for further handling or storage.\nPrepare luciferase assay reagent (LAR) by resuspending the provided lyophilized luciferase assay substrate in 10 mL of the supplied luciferase assay buffer.\nPrepare an adequate volume to perform the desired number of dual-luciferase reporter assays (100 µL reagent per assay). Add 1 volume of 50x stop substrate to 50 volumes of stop buffer in a glass or siliconized polypropylene tube.\nDual-luciferase reporter (DLR) assay\n\t\nProgram luminometers to provide a 2-second pre-read delay, followed by a 10-second measurement period.\nPredispense 100 µL of luciferase assay reagent into the appropriate number of luminometer tubes to complete the desired number of DLR Assays.\nCarefully transfer up to 20 µL of cell lysate into the luminometer tube containing LAR; mix by pipetting 2 or 3 times. Place the tube in the luminometer and initiate reading.\nRemove the sample tube from the luminometer, add 100 µL of stop reagent and vortex briefly to mix. Replace the sample in the luminometer, and initiate reading.\nRecord the renilla luciferase activity normalized to the firefly luciferase activity, namely the reciprocal of the ratio displayed on screen.\nDiscard the reaction tube, and proceed to the next assay.\nSubscription Required.
