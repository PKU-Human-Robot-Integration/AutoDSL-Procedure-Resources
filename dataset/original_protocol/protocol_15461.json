    "1. Vector selection\nChoose a vector to perform downstream experiments with. Any vector is applicable for this 2- and 3-step PCR method.\nBased on choice of vector, choose appropriate restriction enzymes for cloning.\n2. Primer design for site directed mutagenesis\nDecide between either the 2-step or 3-step PCR strategy (2-step is only for mutations <200 bp from either end of the DNA of interest). For the 2-step PCR, go to step 2.2 and for the 3-step PCR go to step 2.3.\nDesign primers for 2-step PCR.\n\t\nDesign primer 1 and 3 to amplify the DNA of interest and with a 5’ overhang that contains 4 nucleotides (e.g., ATAT or AGCT) followed by the relevant restriction recognition site necessary to clone into the chosen vector.\nDesign primer 2 to introduce mutation(s) at the desired site(s) and flank the mutation with 10-15 complementary nucleotides on both sides. Make the primer reverse if the mutation is introduced at the 5’ end or forward if the mutation is introduced at the 3’ end.\nDesign primers for 3-step PCR.\n\t\nDesign primer 1 and 4 to amplify the DNA of interest and with a 5’ overhang that contains 4 nucleotides (e.g., ATAT or AGCT) followed by the relevant restriction recognition site necessary to clone into the chosen vector.\nDesign primer 2 and 3 to introduce mutation(s) at desired site(s) and flank the mutation by 10-15 complementary nucleotides on both sides. Primer 2 and 3 are reverse complementary.\n3. PCR amplification of wild type DNA for cloning\nNOTE: For details on PCR, see6.\nPerform PCR6 using primers 1+2 (2-step PCR) or 1+4 (3-step PCR) and use wild type DNA as template to obtain PCR product I. Use the PCR program in Table 1.\nValidate PCR by agarose gel electrophoresis.",
    "Make an agarose gel solution (2%) by adding 2 g of agarose per 100 mL of 1x Tris-acetate-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (TAE) buffer. Dissolve the agarose by boiling in a microwave oven. Add the DNA-staining dye ethidium bromide (to a final concentration of ~ 0.5 µg/mL) to the agarose gel solution for visualization.\nCast agarose gel, place it in an electrophoresis unit, and load PCR samples (mixed with DNA loading dye) and a DNA ladder of known size. Run samples at 75 W for 45 min, or until bands are separated adequately, and visualize bands at an ultra-violet (UV) table or with a gel imaging system.\nPurify the PCR product with a gel extraction kit (Table of Materials) and measure the concentration of purified DNA with a spectrophotometer (Table of Materials).\nStore the purified DNA at -20 °C (in Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer – long term storage) or 4 °C (in dH2O – short term storage) until used in step 5.\n4. PCR to introduce site-directed mutations in the DNA\nPCR for 2-step PCR (see step 4.2 for 3-step PCR)\n\t\nPerform PCR6 using primers 1+2 if mutations are in the 5’ end or 2+3 if the mutations are in the 3’ end and use wild type DNA as a template to obtain PCR product II (see Table 1 for PCR program).\nValidate PCR by agarose gel electrophoresis as in step 3.2.1 and 3.2.2.\nPurify the PCR product with a gel extraction kit (Table of Materials) and measure the concentration of purified DNA with a spectrophotometer (Table of Materials).\nStore purified DNA at -20 °C (in TE buffer) or 4 °C (in dH2O) until used in step 5.",
    "Perform PCR6 using PCR product II as the primer together with primer 3 if mutations are in the 5’ end or primer 1 if the mutations are in the 3’ end and use wild type DNA as template to obtain PCR product III (see Table 1 for PCR program).\nValidate PCR by agarose gel electrophoresis as in step 3.2.1 and 3.2.2.\nPurify PCR product with a gel extraction kit (Table of Materials) and measure concentration of purified DNA with a spectrophotometer (Table of Materials).\nStore purified DNA at -20 °C (in TE buffer) or 4 °C (in dH2O) until step 5.\nPCR for 3-step PCR\n\t\nPerform PCR6 using primers 1+2 and 3+4 in separate reactions and use wild type DNA as template to obtain PCR product II and III (see Table 1 for PCR program).\nValidate PCRs by agarose gel electrophoresis as in step 3.2.1 and 3.2.2.\nPurify PCR products with a gel extraction kit (Table of Materials) and measure the concentration of purified DNA with a spectrophotometer (Table of Materials).\nStore purified DNA at -20 °C (in TE buffer) or 4 °C (in dH2O).\nPerform PCR6 using primers 1+4 and use 2-5 ng of both PCR products II and III as the templates (in the same reaction) to obtain PCR product IV (see Table 1 for PCR program).\nValidate PCR by agarose gel electrophoresis as in step 3.2.1 and 3.2.2.\n\t\tNOTE: It is not unusual to get several incorrect bands (can sometimes be reduced by using less template). However, the incorrect PCR products can be ignored if the correctly sized band is excised and gel-extracted.\nIf correct, purify PCR product with a gel extraction kit (Table of Materials) and measure concentration of purified DNA with a spectrophotometer (Table of Materials).",
    "Store purified DNA at -20 °C (in TE buffer) or 4 °C (in dH2O) until step 5.\n5. Recombination of wild type and mutant version(s) of DNA into the chosen vector\nNOTE: For details on following steps, see7.\nDigest purified PCR products I and III (from 2-step PCR) and/or IV (from 3-step PCR) using the relevant restriction enzymes.\n\t\nIn 20 µL of 1x digestion buffer with 1 µL of each restriction enzyme, digest 200 ng of PCR product at 37 °C for 30-60 min.\nPurify digested PCR product by gel-extraction using a gel extraction kit (Table of Materials), measure the DNA concentration of purified DNA with a spectrophotometer (Table of Materials), and store at -20 °C (in TE buffer) or 4 °C (in dH2O) until used for step 5.6.\nDigest purified vector with relevant restriction enzymes and treat with alkaline phosphatase to decrease vector re-ligation events. Do not treat PCR products with alkaline phosphatase.\n\t\nIn 30 µL of 1x digestion buffer with 1 µL of each restriction enzyme and 1 µL of alkaline phosphatase, digest 1,000 ng of the vector at 37 °C for 30-60 min.\nSeparate digested vector from waste DNA (e.g., uncut vector and cut-out DNA) using agarose gel electrophoresis as in step 3.2.1 and 3.2.2.\nPurify digested vector by gel-extraction using a gel extraction kit (Table of Materials), measure DNA concentration of purified DNA with a spectrophotometer (Table of Materials), and store at -20 °C (in TE buffer) or 4 °C (in dH2O) until used for step 5.6.\nLigate digested PCR products into digested vector with the reactions specified in Table 2.\nIncubate at room temperature for 2 h or overnight at 16 °C.\nTransform recipient strain (e.g., E. coli K12) with ligation reactions.",
    "Grow strain to OD600=0.3-0.5 and transfer a 1 mL culture to as many 1.5 mL tubes as ligase reactions.\nSpin at 3,500 x g for 5 min and discard supernatant.\nResuspend cells in 200 μL of transformation buffer (10 mL of lysogeny broth (LB) with 0.1 g/mL polyethylene glycol 3350, 5% dimethyl sulfate and 20 mM MgCl2).\nAdd ligation reaction, and place the tubes on ice for 30 min.\nHeat-shock for 2 min at 42 °C.\nAdd 1 mL of LB to the 1.5 mL tubes, and allow phenotypic expression of antibiotic resistance for at least 45 min at 37 °C.\nSpin the cells at 3,500 x g for 5 min, discard 1 mL of supernatant, and resuspend the cells in the remaining supernatant.\nPlate the cells on plates with appropriate antibiotics and incubate overnight at 37 °C.\nIdentify transformants harboring vectors with successful integration of DNA insert (e.g., by PCR using vector- and insert-specific primers).\nValidate sequence of DNA by sanger sequencing.\n\tCAUTION: Do not use the same primers for sequencing as used for step 5.9.\n6. Using constructed vectors for in vitro and/or in vivo experiments\nIn vivo experiment\n\tNOTE: This is an example of using a vector to express wild type/mutated RNA to characterize post-transcriptional regulation. For further details on western blotting, see8.\n\t\nGrow E. coli K12 strains with constructed vectors in appropriate medium and induce expression if required. Harvest samples by centrifugation.\nPrepare samples for sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) by dissolving cell pellets in 1x SDS sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 2.5% SDS, 0.002% bromophenol blue, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) and boil at 95 °C for 5 min.",
    "NOTE: It is possible to cast a gel or use a commercially available precast gel.

Repeat twice more.\nAdd secondary antibody (dissolved in 1x TTBS buffer) that targets the primary antibodies and allow for detection (e.g., horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies. Incubate for 1 h with gentle agitation.\nWash the membrane in 1x TTBS for 10 min to remove unbound antibodies. Repeat twice more.\nVisualize the membrane with a technique compatible with the secondary antibodies (e.g., by imaging after incubation with a luminol-derived chemiluminescence, if a HRP-conjugated secondary antibody was used).\nIn vitro experiment\n\tNOTE: This is an example of using the vector as a template for in vitro transcription of RNA to characterize RNA-protein interactions.
