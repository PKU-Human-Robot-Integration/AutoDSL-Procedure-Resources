    "Animals received humane care in compliance with the Guide for the Principles of Laboratory Animals, prepared by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, and published by the National Institutes of Health. All animal protocols were approved by the responsible local authority (‘‘Amt für Gesundheit und Verbraucherschutz, Hansestadt Hamburg’’/ Animal protocol # 109/16).\n1. Obtain Animals\nCommercially obtain female Guinea pigs weighing 500–600 g.\nHouse them under conventional conditions in animal cages. Feed standard rat chow and autoclaved water ad libidum.\n2. Transthoracic Echocardiography\nPlace the guinea pig in an induction chamber and anesthetize the animal with isoflurane (2–3%). Check the depth of anesthesia by lack of response to the toe-pinch. \nPlace the anesthetized Guinea pig on a warming platform (40–42 °C) in a supine position. Continue anesthesia via a nose cone (isoflurane 1.5-2%)\nShave and depilate the guinea pig´s thorax using an electric animal hair shaver.\nApply prewarmed (~25 °C) ultrasound transducer gel. Use an echocardiography system that is equipped with a transducer frequency higher than 15 MHz.\nAcquire two-dimensional parasternal long axis views by placing the transducer on the guinea´s pig thorax facing from the right neck towards the left leg and record long axis B-mode images at the plane of the aortic valve with a concurrent visualization of the LV apex. Investigate the pre-operative left-ventricular function.\nTurn the transducer by 90° degrees to obtain a short axis B-mode view at the mid-papillary level.\nNOTE: The animal is then immediately transferred to the OR table. The animal is continuously anesthetized with 3% isoflurane. 0.05 mg/kg atropine (i.m.) is injected to avoid increased bronchial secretion during mechanical ventilation.\n3. Surgery\nInduction of Myocardial infarction",
    "Inject 4–5 mg/kg carprofen and 0.05 mg/kg buprenorphine for analgesia subcutaneously with a 21 G needle and a 10 mL syringe. 0.5 mg/kg Atropine is injected subcutaneously with a 21 G needle and a 10 mL syringe.\nPlace the guinea pig on its back and keep anesthesia with a facemask covering mouth and nose. Check the depth of anesthesia by pinching the hind feet (lack of pedal reflex).\nSpread the guinea pigs’ legs and fix the position using tape.\nShave the chest and the tracheal region of the anesthetized animal with an electric shaver. Disinfect the area widely using iodine-based scrub, followed by 80% ethanol. Repeat this disinfection steps twice.\nPerform a 1.5 cm vertical incision in the tracheal area and bluntly dissect the muscles covering the trachea until you see the trachea. Puncture the trachea with 18 G i.v. cannula and insert the flexible part of the cannula as a tracheal tube.\nConnect the tracheal tube to an animal respirator to continuously ventilate the guinea pig during the procedure.\nNOTE: Now the anesthesia is maintained with isoflurane 3% via the tracheal tube (inspiration assisted ventilation with maximum inspiration pressure, respiration rate: 100–120/min, peak inspiration pressure: 18-22 cm Hg using PEEP-ventilation while the chest is open).\nIdentify the 5th intercostal space by counting the rib spaces beginning at the first intercostal space. Perform a 2 cm horizontal incision on the 5th intercostal space on the left side of the guinea pig using scissors and a tweezer. Insert a small animal retractor. Dissect the muscles with an electrocautery until the intercostal muscles are reached, which can be seen after removing the subcutaneous tissue, are reached.",
    "Gently dissect the intercostal muscles with tweezers until the pleural space is reached and one can see the left lung in front. Insert the retractor between the ribs and open it carefully until a good view of the heart is obtained.\nOpen the pericardium approximately 1 cm in the region of the anterior left ventricular wall with scissors. Place a compress on the left lung to protect it from damage when inducing the cryoinjury of the left ventricle.\nPlace the tip of an eroded metal stamp (aluminum) with a cross-sectional diameter of 0.5 cm into liquid nitrogen for 3 min.\nPress the nitrogen cooled probe onto the left anterior wall of the heart for 30 s. Then separate it from the heart using an electric soldering iron (250 °C) which is placed inside the stamp to warm it up. Repeat this procedure 3 times to obtain a transmural myocardial injury. Observe the blanching of the myocardium.\nInflate the lungs with maximum pressure (by clamping the outflow tube of the ventilator for 2 s), to avoid atelectasis of the lung. Remove the retractor from the intercostal space.\nClose the ribs with two 3-0 sutures. Close the muscles over the ribs with a 4-0 running suture. For closure of the skin use 5-0 suture single stitches.\nReduce the isoflurane to 1%. When the animal is breathing spontaneously, remove the tracheal tube, and continue anesthesia with a facemask (isoflurane 2–3%).\nAssure the absence of reflexes by pinching the hind limb to monitor sufficient depth of anesthesia. Then use a single 8-0 suture to close the puncture site at the trachea. Close the wound with three single stich 4-0 sutures.\nUse buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg per 12 h) and carprofen (5 mg/kg per 24 h) for pain medication for the following 5 days.",
    "Implantation of EHT (7 days after cryoinjury)\nPlace the guinea pig in an induction chamber and anesthetize the animal with isoflurane Check the depth of anesthesia by the lack of response to the toe-pinch.\nInject 4–5 mg/kg carprofen and 0.05 mg/kg buprenorphine subcutaneously with a 21 G needle and a 10 mL syringe after induction of anesthesia. Place the guinea pig on its back and keep anesthesia with a facemask covering mouth and nose.\nNOTE: Sufficiency of anesthesia should be checked by pinching the hind feet.\nSpread the guinea pig’s legs and fix the position using tape.\nPerform the pre-surgical preparations as described in step 3.1.4–3.1.6. Perform a 2 cm horizontal skin incision in the scar area of the left lateral side using scissors and tweezers.\nGently dissect the extrapleural adhesions using an electrocautery. Carefully open the pleural space with scissors. Insert a rib spreader to expose the heart.\nVisually identify the region of the infarction by its pale color in comparison to the healthy surrounding myocardium. Place the engineered heart tissue patch over the infarction region.\nSecure it with two 8-0 sutures at both sides. Make sure to secure the patch in the non-infarcted area of the heart (Figure 1). Inflate the lungs with pressure, to avoid atelectasis of the lung. Remove the retractor from the intercostal space.\nClose the ribs with two 3-0 sutures. Close the muscles over the ribs with a 4-0 running suture. For closure of the skin use 5-0 suture single stitches.\nReduce the isoflurane to 1%. When the animal is breathing spontaneously, remove the tracheal tube, and continue anesthesia with a facemask (isoflurane 2–3%).",
    "Assure the absence of reflexes by pinching the hind limb to monitor sufficient depth of anesthesia. Then use a single 8-0 suture to close the puncture site at the trachea. Close the wound with three single stitch 4-0 sutures.\nUse buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg per 12 h) and carprofen (5 mg/kg per 24 h) for pain medication for the following 5 days.\nFour weeks after EHT implantation perform a transthoracic echocardiography (as described in step 2) to monitor LV function over time.\nNOTE: The LV function is monitored before EHT implantation and 4 weeks after implantation to monitor for improvement of cardiac function by EHT implantation\nEuthanize the animal which IACUC approved protocol and surgically explant the heart for further analysis.\nSubscription Required.
