    "All animal procedures, used to obtain tissue samples, were approval by the animal ethics committee at SUNY Downstate Medical Center.\n1. Preparation of Solutions and Equipment\nPrepare a 150 mM NaCl backfill solution for the reference barrel of the ISM. Store it in a 10 mL syringe attached to a 0.22 µm filter (to remove bacteria or particles).\nPrepare a 150 mM TMA chloride (TMA-Cl) backfill solution for the microelectrodes. Store it in a 10 mL syringe attached to a 0.22 µm filter. Prepare the TMA-Cl solutions (in this protocol) from a 5 M manufacturer stock solution to ensure the correct concentration.\nChloridize at least four silver wires for the fabrication of microelectrodes by submerging the wires in bleach (sodium hypochlorite) for at least 2 h. Remove excess bleach with ethanol and allow the wires to dry.\nPrepare 50 mL of 0.3% agarose in 150 mM NaCl and 0.5 mM TMA-Cl in a beaker and cover it. Use agarose that is powdered and reasonably fresh to ensure good diffusion measurements.\nHeat and mix the agarose solution with a stir bar to dissolve it. Allow the solution to cool to room temperature. Store this at 4 °C for up to 1 week.\nPrepare an indifferent (ground) electrode made out of 4% agarose in 1 M KCl (directions in Supplement A)\nFabricate a small, porous cup that can fit in the experimental chamber and that allows for electrical continuity between its contents and the outside environment (Figure 2a). Place a metal ring on the bottom of this cup to prevent it from floating when partially submerged in water.",
    "Use serial dilution of a 5 M TMA-Cl stock to make five 100 mL TMA-Cl solutions for the calibration of the ISMs. Solutions should have final concentrations of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 mM TMA-Cl, all in 150 mM NaCl. Store the calibration solutions in a sealable cup to prevent evaporation.\n2. Electronic Setup\nConnect the components of the RTI experimental setup according to the block diagram in Figure 2b; include an amplifier with two input channels (one of which should be very high-impedance for the ion-selective barrel of the ISM), a low-pass filter set at 10 Hz, a chart recorder, an A/D + D/A converter, an iontophoretic unit (or an amplifier capable of supplying constant-current pulses), and a computer (PC) running the Wanda and Walter programs. Inspect the electronic setup to confirm that all connections are in place.\nShield the experimental setup in a grounded enclosure (such as a Faraday cage), if necessary, as ISMs have a high resistance and are sensitive to artifacts created by nearby movement.\nCreate a dedicated ISM calibration station consisting of a dual input amplifier, a chart recorder, an appropriate ISM holder, and an indifferent ground electrode. If possible, shield the enclosure. Skip this step if the ISMs are calibrated in the experimental setup (step 3.29)\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55755/55755fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2: Porous Experimental Cup and Electronic Setup. (a) Porous experimental cup: A porous mesh is used to create an experimental cup that allows for electrical continuity between the agarose (inside) and the experimental bathing fluid (outside). A metal ring is attached to the bottom of the cup to prevent the cup from floating in the bathing solution. (b) Block diagram of the RTI setup (steps 2.1 and 2.2): An ISM is connected to an amplifier (amp.). The ISM has two barrels. One contains liquid ion exchanger (LIX) in the tip and generates a voltage proportional to the logarithm of the TMA concentration at the tip together with the local ambient voltage; the signal path is represented by a red line. The other barrel of the ISM is known as the reference barrel and measures the ambient voltage at the tip of the ISM; it is connected by a blue signal path. The amplifier has two so-called head stages that connect to the ISM; these units have a gain of 1 (x1) and match the high impedance of the microelectrode to the low impedance of the rest of the amplifier circuitry. The head stage connected to the ion-selective barrel must be able to match an incoming resistance of about 1,000 MΩ, whereas the resistance of the reference barrel is typically about 10 MΩ. After leaving the head stage, the voltage from the reference barrel is inverted and subtracted from the voltage on the ion-selective barrel using a summing amplifier (Σ) to obtain the pure ion signal voltage. The outputs of the amplifier pass to a signal conditioning unit that provides additional amplification and a multipole low-pass filter (≤10 Hz; typically a Bessel filter), which removes noise and prevents signal aliasing at the analog-to-digital converter (A/D).",
    "The outputs of the filter are also displayed on a strip chart recorder. The A/D converter digitizes the signals and sends them to a personal computer (PC). The PC also generates a digital signal that is converted by a digital-to-analog converter (D/A) to an analog voltage pulse that is fed to the iontophoresis unit, which converts the voltage to a current pulse of constant amplitude and sends it to the iontophoresis microelectrode. The iontophoresis signal path is represented by a green line. The data acquisition and iontophoresis signal are under the control of the Wanda program, which generates an output file for each diffusion record in the form of a voltage versus time recording, along with all the parameters that define the experiment. A second program, Walter, reads the output file and uses ISM calibration data to convert the digitized voltages to concentrations. The concentration versus time curves are then fitted in Walter to the appropriate solution to the diffusion equation. D and nt are extracted if the medium is agarose, and λ and α extracted if the medium is brain. Analog signals are solid lines; digital signals are dotted lines. There is also an indifferent ground electrode (not shown) in the bath containing the slice. Red lines = ion signal, Blue lines = reference signal, Green lines = iontophoresis command, Solid lines = analog, Dotted lines = digital.

    "3. Preparation and Calibration of Ion-selective Microelectrodes\nFabricate ISMs using the protocol below one day prior to the experiment. Make ISMs in batches to ensure that at least two work on the day of the experiment.\n\tNOTE: Most ISMs are stable for a day or two. ISM fabrication is sensitive to humidity and atmospheric conditions. Not every microelectrode will calibrate successfully.\nChip away roughly 0.5 cm of glass at the end of one of the barrels of a double-barreled borosilicate glass capillary using an old pair of forceps.\nChip a single barrel on the opposite end of the capillary (Figure 3a). Ensure that the septum is not damaged (critical). Caution: Wear goggles to prevent injury due to projectile glass.\nPlace the capillary in a bottle of acetone for at least 1 h to remove contaminants.\nRemove the capillary from the acetone and pulse clean, dry, compressed nitrogen gas or air through it to remove any excess acetone. Remove all acetone in the capillary, as residual acetone can interfere with silanization (crucial).\nFabricate the tip of the micropipette on either a vertical or horizontal puller. Tailor the parameters to pull a pipette with a long taper and sharp tip, about 1 µm or less in diameter. At the end of this step, one capillary will be made into two pipettes (Figure 3a).\nVisualize a single micropipette under a compound, upright microscope with a 10X objective. Cut the tip off using a glass microscope slide so that the final diameter of the tip (i.e., both barrels) is between 2 and 5 µm (Figure 3b). This pipette will be referred to as an ISM from now on.",
    "Fill the chipped barrel of the ISM with 150 mM NaCl reference solution through the opening on the chipped side using a 10 mL syringe attached to a 0.22 µm filter and a 28 G, 97 mm needle (Figure 3b). Do not fill the barrel past three-fourths the height of the barrel.\nFill the non-chipped barrel of the ISM with 150 mM TMA-Cl backfill solution. Tap the ISM gently to knock any air bubbles out of the solution. Check for bubbles under the microscope used for chipping the tip.\nFlame the back of the ISM using a Bunsen burner to ensure that no communication of the backfill solution occurs across the septum at the back of the ISM. Ensure that the top one-fourth of the ISM is dry after flaming.\nInsert a chloridized silver wire into the reference solution of the ISM and bend the wire protruding from the capillary to mark this as the reference barrel (Figure 3c). Ensure that the wire is submerged in the backfill solution and remains in solution for the duration of the experiment.\nSlide a short length of polytetrafluoroethylene tubing (about 20 cm long) over the tip of a 25 G syringe needle. Place the other end of the tubing in the back of the ion-selective barrel. Ensure that the tubing is in the barrel but above the backfill solution (Figure 3c).\nHeat a stick of dental wax with a Bunsen burner and seal both the tubing and the silver wire into their respective barrels (Figure 3c). Ensure that a complete air seal is produced around the plastic tubing in the ion-selective barrel (critical).",
    "Prepare a small, transparent glass container (5 mL or less) of 4% chlorotrimethylsilane in xylene. Caution: Xylenes and silanes are very hazardous to health; handle both chemicals inside a fume hood and discard appropriately.\nPosition the container in front of a stereo dissection microscope mounted horizontally in a fume hood. Secure the ISM vertically over the container using a micromanipulator (Figure 3d).\nDip the tip of the microelectrode in the chlorotrimethylsilane solution.\nAttach an empty 10-mL syringe to the 25-gauge needle leading to the ISM. Apply positive air pressure from the syringe until a bubble of TMA-Cl solution is formed; this step should be performed under direct visualization through the microscope.\nTap the ISM holder gently to knock the bubble off of the tip.\nDraw the chlorotrimethylsilane solution to a height of roughly 1,500 µm into the tip of the ISM using negative pressure on the 10 mL syringe.\nCompletely expel the chlorotrimethylsilane solution from the tip of the ISM until a bubble of TMA-Cl solution is created at the tip (Figure 3d).\nRepeat steps 3.19 and 3.20 five times. Ensure that an even, uninterrupted column of fluid is drawn into the tip each time. If no solution can be drawn into the tip, check whether the tubing is blocked, the air seal is incomplete, or the tip of the ISM is blocked.\nFlush all of the chlorotrimethylsilane solution out of the tip until a bubble of TMA-Cl solution is created.\nWhile maintaining positive pressure on the syringe, remove the ISM from the xylene solution. Ensure that all the xylene solution is expelled from the ISM tip, as excess xylene will ruin the exchanger column created in subsequent steps.",
    "Place the tip of the ISM in a small, transparent container (either the one the exchanger came in or a small cuvette) holding the liquid ion exchanger (LIX) for TMA. Perform this step under direct visualization using the horizontal microscope setup.\nApply a small amount of negative pressure to draw a minimal amount of the LIX into the tip (i.e., as soon as LIX is seen entering the tip, stop applying negative pressure).\nDisconnect the 10-mL syringe from the tubing and allow the ISM to sit for 5 min. During that time, the LIX will enter the silanized tip until it reaches a state of equilibrium.\nRemove the ISM from the LIX. Pull the tubing out of the exchanger barrel (while removing as little wax as possible). Place a chloridized silver wire into the small opening created at the back end of the ISM. Seal the wire in the backfill of the exchanger barrel with melted wax.\nAllow the ISM to sit for at least 30 min. Attach completed ISMs to the inside rim of a beaker using any pliable, temporary adhesive.\nCalibrate the ISM by recording the voltage measured by the ISM in each calibration solution made in step 1.8.\n\tNOTE: Calibration can be performed in a calibration station (see step 2.3) or in the experimental setup. This procedure is outlined in Supplement B and in Haack et al10.\nIf the ISM calibration was successful for multiple ISMs, pause here until the day of intended use. If not, fabricate more ISMs.\nOn the day of the experiment, again calibrate the microelectrode (see step 3.29).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55755/55755fig3.jpg",

(a) ISM after chipping back the ends of a capillary and pulling (steps 3.2-3.6): A single barrel at both ends of a glass capillary is chipped. An ISM is generated by pulling one double-barreled glass capillary to generate two micropipettes with fine tips. (b) ISM after backfilling both barrels (steps 3.7-3.9): The tip of a single ISM is chipped to a diameter of 2-5 µm.

[High magnification] The view through a horizontally mounted stereomicroscope of an ISM tip in chlorotrimethylsilane solution. After visualization of the tip through a microscope, small amount of TMA-Cl solution is expelled from the ion-selective barrel (enough to generate a small bubble of TMA-Cl solution). The ISM holder is tapped to release a TMA-Cl solution bubble and then chlorotrimethylsilane is drawn up into the tip. This cycle is repeated several times. After all chlorotrimethylsilane is ejected from the ISM, the ISM is placed into the liquid ion exchanger (LIX) for TMA and LIX is drawn into the tip of the ion-selective barrel.

Preparation of Iontophoresis Microelectrodes\nNOTE: Iontophoresis microelectrodes should be fabricated on the day of the experiment.",
    "Pull a double-barreled borosilicate glass capillary on a vertical or horizontal puller. Tailor the parameters to pull a pipette similar to the micropipettes pulled in step 3.6 (Figure 4a).\nPlace the micropipette under the compound microscope used in step 3.7 and cut the tip off using a glass microscope slide so that the resulting diameter is between 2 and 5 µm (Figure 4a).\nFill both barrels with the 150 mM TMA-Cl backfill solution using a 10 mL syringe attached to a 0.22 µm filter and a 28 G, 97 mm needle (Figure 4a).\nTap the micropipette gently to ensure that no air bubbles are left in the solution of both barrels.\nPlace chloridized silver wires into both barrels of the micropipette. Ensure that the wires are deep enough in the backfill solutions so that they will remain in contact with the solutions for the duration of the experiment.\nSeal the wires into the barrels using hot dental wax. Gently interlock the wires by twisting them around each other (completed microelectrode shown in Figure 4b).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55755/55755fig4.jpg\nFigure 4: Preparation of an Iontophoresis Microelectrode.

Preparation of Artificial Cerebrospinal Fluid and Rodent Brain Tissue Slices",
    "Prepare 1 L of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) with a composition appropriate for the experiment and add 0.5 mM TMA-Cl to it.\n\tNOTE: The TMA-Cl is necessary to establish a background concentration of TMA during the experiment.\nPrepare rodent brain slices with a thickness of 400 µm according to standard protocols11,12. Use the ACSF prepared in step 5.1 for the dissection and maintenance of brain slices.\n6. Real-time Iontophoresis in Agarose\nTurn on the computer running the Walter and Wanda programs.\n\tNOTE: These programs are freely available upon request. While this software is not essential, programming similar software or performing the analysis by hand would otherwise be required.\nRun ACSF through the submersion chamber at an appropriate rate (e.g., 2 mL/min). Set the temperature controller to a desired temperature and bubble ACSF with 95% O2/5% CO2 (or another appropriate gas mixture) for the duration of the experiment.\nMount an indifferent (ground) electrode in a suitable holder and submerge the tip into the ACSF running through the submersion chamber. Connect the wire to the ground of the recording setup.\nFill the porous cup (made in step 1.7) with the 0.3% agarose prepared previously and place it in the submersion chamber. Ensure that the solution does not run over the top of the cup.\nSecure a calibrated ISM to the pipette holder of one micromanipulator and an iontophoresis microelectrode to the second. Set the holders to an angle appropriate for the setup (Figure 5a).\nConnect the ISM and iontophoresis microelectrode wires to their respective head stages of the recording amplifier. Alternatively, connect directly to the amplifier (depending on the setup).\nEnsure that the weight/positioning of the connecting wires or clips does not cause any movement of the microelectrodes, as small fluctuations in positioning can influence the results.",
    "Turn on the electronic setup (from step 2). Start Walter and Wanda in separate instances.\nIn the Wanda GUI, click \"Calibrate\" (Figure 6a). In the Calibration box (Figure 6b), fill in the voltages measured during the ISM calibration (step 3.29) and click \"Fit Data.\"\n\tNOTE: This enables fitting to the following representation of the Nicolsky equation (alternatively fit the equation by another means to obtain M and K):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55755/55755eq4.jpg\n\tHere, V is the measured voltage (mV), M is the Nicolsky slope (mV), C is the concentration of ion (mM), K is the interference (mM), and V0 is the offset voltage (mV)3.\nClick \"Accept\" in the Calibrate box to automatically transfer the slope (M) and interference (K) generated in step 6.9 to the main GUI.\n\tNOTE: Here, K represents the Na interference, which is usually negligible.\nOn the left side of the GUI, ensure that all experimental parameters are set in corresponding entries (Figure 6a).\nIn the Source Method box, set the source to the iontophoretic source (default), the \"Record Duration\" to \"200 s\" (default), the \"Pulse Begin\" to \"10 s\" (default), the \"Pulse End\" to \"60 s\" (default), the \"Bias Current\" to \"20 nA\" (default), the \"Main Current\" to \"100 nA\" (default), and the \"Conversion Factor\" to an appropriate value.\nIn the Measuring Electrode box, set \"Bath C\" to the concentration of TMA contained within the bath solution (expressed in mM).

Visualize them under the microscope using a 10X objective (water-immersion objective with a long working distance).\nOffset the voltage on the amplifier to 0 mV for both reference and ISM channels in order to establish the voltage recorded in the agarose as the baseline voltage.\nOn the two-channel amplifier, manually move the ISM channel connector to the voltage subtraction output to set the subtraction 'on' between the reference and ISM channels.\n\tNOTE: Subtraction ensures that the voltage changes in the ISM channel reflect the changes in TMA concentration alone.\nMove the ISM so that it touches the tip of the iontophoresis microelectrode. Center the tips on each other in all three directional axes.\nZero the relative positions of both microelectrodes on the micromanipulator control boxes. Ensure that the microelectrodes are centered accurately and precisely (critical).\nMove the ISM 120 µm away from the iontophoresis microelectrode in one axis (the left-right axis, Figure 5b). Input this distance into the \"Measuring Electrode\" box of the GUI (Figure 6a).\nStart a recording by clicking \"Acquire\" in the GUI (Figure 6a); allow the program to record a full recording.\n\tNOTE: The iontophoresis microelectrode receives a constant bias current. After clicking \"Acquire,\" there is a short delay before the main current is applied for a limited duration.",

Wait until the TMA signal returns to baseline before acquiring new records; the program will save each record for later analysis.\nCheck the spacing of the two microelectrodes by moving the ISM back to the zero-position specified by the control box. If the microelectrodes are no longer centered, center them again using the same strategy as in step 6.17.

Brain Data Analysis\nOpen a new spreadsheet for the analysis output.\nRepeat steps 7.1-7.4 in Walter to analyze the recordings taken from the brain.\nWrite the data onto the spreadsheet program by clicking \"Excel\" in the Walter menu. Record the α, volume fraction of the brain ECS; λ, tortuosity of the brain ECS; and k (s-1), non-specific clearance.\n10. Checking Transport Number and ISM Calibration\nMeasure the ISM transport number (nt) at the end of the experiment using the protocol below. Alternatively, check nt after critical trials or when measurements appear anomalous. However, checking nt too many times can result in trauma to the brain slice.\nTake new recordings in agarose. See steps 6.4, 6.11, 6.12, 6.14, 6.15, and 6.17-6.22.\nRepeat steps 7.1-7.4 in Walter to obtain the nt from the new agarose recordings. Inspect the spreadsheet: if the nt has changed by more than 10% from the nt obtained prior to the brain measurements, the data obtained with this iontophoretic microelectrode are not reliable.",
    "Perform a new calibration (see step 3.29) for the ISM after all brain data has been collected. Use newly obtained ISM calibration data as the input in the Wanda Calibrate box (see steps 6.9 and 6.10) and check that the slope value differs by less than 10% from the previous calibration.\n\tNOTE: The data obtained with this ISM are not reliable if the slope value differs by more than 10% from the previous calibration.\nSubscription Required.
