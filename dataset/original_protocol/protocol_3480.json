Preparations of infraorbital branches of the trigeminal nerves, ventral nerves of the spinal cord, and sciatic nerves\n(A) Schematic diagram illustrates the locations in the body of the infraorbital branch of the trigeminal nerve (infraorbital nerve, ION), spinal lumbar 5 (L5) ventral nerve, spinal nerve, and sciatic nerves of the rat.\n(B and C) Images show the anatomy that exposes the infraorbital nerve (B) and a complex of L5 ventral nerve, spinal nerve, and sciatic nerves (C) in a rat.",
    "(D and E) Images show a freshly dissected infraorbital nerve bundle with their trigeminal ganglion (D) and a complex of the L5 ventral nerve, spinal nerve, and sciatic nerves (E). The complex also contains the L5 dorsal root ganglion (DRG). In patch-clamp recording experiments, a nerve bundle such as L5 ventral nerve can be dissected out without having the other nerve component connected if recordings are only performed on that nerve bundle. Scale bar, 3 mm.\nCarefully cut open the connective tissues that surround the IONs by using a micro scissors.\nGently dissect out and harvest the IONs together with their TGs (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nVentral nerves, spinal nerve, and sciatic nerves dissection\nRemove the spinae muscles by using a pair of luer bone rongeur forceps.\nOpen the spine through the Th1 to S1 levels and expose the spinal cord.\nIdentify a L5 DRG and follow the L5 peripheral nerve down to the knee level (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nHarvest the complex of the sciatic, spinal, and ventral nerves from the rat (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nCritical: We recommend to keep nerve bundles moisturized by periodically applying drops of ice-cold L-15 medium on the nerves during the aforementioned nerve dissection procedures. During harvesting of the nerve bundles, avoid to stretch the nerve fibers since a strong stretch may lead to a mechanical damage of nerve fibers to potentially cause acute nerve demyelination.\nPlace the nerves into a 35 × 10-mm petri dish that contains 2 mL ice-cold L-15 medium and keep the petri dish on ice.\nNote: At this point, when kept in the ice-cold (4°C) L-15 medium, the nerve preparations can be maintained healthy for up to 10 h.",
    "Under a stereoscopic microscope, carefully peel off the connective tissues including blood vessels, fibrofatty tissue, and epineurium on the surface of the nerve bundles with a pair of fine forceps.\nNote: The connective tissues on the surface of the nerve bundles are observed as shown in the Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D.\nNote: Avoid strongly stretching or compressing the nerves with the forceps during this procedure.\nAdd 1,350 μL of oxygenated Krebs bath solution into the recording chamber.\nAffix one nerve preparation in a recording chamber with a tissue anchor and submerge it in the Krebs solution at the room temperature of 24°C.\nMount the recording chamber on the stage of the microscope, and adjust the nerve bundle orientation so that it is oriented perpendicular to the tip of the patch-clamp recording pipette.\nOptional: If the conduction velocity of a single myelinated fiber is going to be measured, at this point, one can aspirate a peripheral cutting end of the nerve bundle into a suction electrode, and electrical stimulation can later be delivered through the suction electrode to evoke nerve impulses to allow to determine nerve conduction velocity.\nAdd 150 μL of the dispase-collagenase enzyme solution directly into the recording chamber and mix the enzymes with the Krebs solution well by pipetting up and down. Incubate the nerve bundle with the enzyme solution at the room temperature of 24°C for 5 min. The final concentrations of each enzyme are 0.07% in the Krebs solution.\nWash off the enzyme solution by continuously perfusing the nerve preparation with the oxygenated Krebs bath solution at 2 mL/min.\nNode of Ranvier identification\nTiming: 5 min\nIdentify a healthy node of Ranvier for pressure-clamped patch-clamp recordings (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/368-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Identifying a health node of Ranvier for pressure-clamped patch-clamp recordings",
    "(A) Image shows a segment of an infraorbital nerve bundle viewed under a 40× objective. Arrows indicate the healthy nodes that shows very small gap at each node.\n(B) Image shows a segment of a different infraorbital nerve bundle viewed under a 40× objective. Arrowheads indicate two unhealthy nodes that show a large gap at each node. Scale bar, 10 μm.\nCritical: A healthy myelinated nerve fiber has a narrow space between myelin sheaths at the node of Ranvier (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) and we recommend to apply patch-clamp recordings to the healthy nodes of Ranvier in experiments. If a larger gap between myelin sheaths is shown at a node of Ranvier of a nerve fiber, it indicates that some degree of nerve damage may have occurred during nerve preparation (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). If many fibers have this type of morphological changes at their nodes of Ranvier, we recommend to discard the nerve bundle and try to obtain a new and healthy nerve bundle.\nPressure-clamped patch-clamp recordings at nodes of Ranvier\nTiming: 10 min\nProcedures of the pressure-clamped patch-clamp recording at the node of Ranvier are shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/368-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Procedures of pressure-clamped patch-clamp recording at the node of Ranvier\n(A) Identify a healthy node for the pressure-clamped patch-clamp recording.\n(B) The tip of the recording pipette approaches the node of Ranvier. The intra- pipette pressure is initially 200 mmHg and adjusted to 80–100 mmHg when the recording pipette tip reach the perineurium tissue at the node of Ranvier.\n(C) The tip of the pipette penetrates the perineurium that surrounds the node of Ranvier. At this point, reduce the intra-pipette pressure to 5 mmHg.",
    "(D) Adjust the position of the recording pipette tip and apply a negative pressure (−2 to −10 mmHg) in the recording pipette to obtain gigaohm seal. The asterisk in the image indicates the tip of the recording pipette.\n(E) An example of membrane responses when the tip of the recording pipette approaches to Schwann cell membranes (middle panel) or to nodal axon membranes (right panel). The left panel shows the baseline holding current before the recording pipette tip approaches membranes. Scale bar, 10 μm.\nNote: Prepare the patch-clamp recording pipettes that have electrode resistances ranging from 8 to 10 MΩ after filling the pipette with recording electrode internal solution.\nChoose a healthy node of Ranvier in the nerve bundle (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nFill a pipette with recording electrode internal solution by using a syringe that is attached with a 0.22-μm syringe filter.\nEnter the pipette into the bath solution and adjust electrode offset at the holding potential of 0 mV.\nApply a high positive pressure of 200 mmHg into the recording pipette by using the HSPC and bring the pipette closer to the node of Ranvier within 5–10 μm (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nNote: It is difficult to insert the recording pipette tip into the nerve fiber layer if nerve fibers are still covered by some connective tissues. Return to step 4 and peel off connective tissues carefully with a pair of fine forceps.",
    "Critical: Pay attention and make sure that there is no air leakage in the pressure- clamped patch-clamp recording system and that the positive pressure is well maintained in the recording pipette. The pressure should stay stable, and there is a leak if the pressure drops. Also make sure that the tip of the recording pipette is not blocked by small particles that may be present in the recording electrode internal solution.\nReduce the positive pressure to 80–100 mmHg and advance the recording pipette tip to approach the node of Ranvier horizontally from one side of the node of Ranvier.\nSlowly penetrate the perineurium that wraps around the nodal axon (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nNote: It may take several attempts with forward-backward-forward movement of the recording pipette tip to penetrate the perineurium at the node of Ranvier. After the pipette tip successfully penetrates the perineurium, one can see that there is an immediate expansion in the space between myelin and perineurium. This change may be due to the flowing of the recording electrode internal solution into the space.\nQuickly reduce the positive pressure to 5 mmHg in the recording pipette using the high-speed pressure-clamp device and then change the command holding potential of the recording electrode to −60 mV.\nSlightly advance the tip of the recording pipette to approach and make a contact with the nodal axon (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).",
    "Critical: Since axonal membrane is unable to be clearly differentiated from perineural tissues and Schwann cell membranes under the IR-DIC microscope, accessing axonal membranes with the recording pipette tip is mainly judged by the reduction of seal-test currents. Once touching axonal membranes, one can see a strong current oscillation accompanied with the reduction of seal-test currents in seal-test traces (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E). On the other hand, if the recording pipette tip touches Schwann cell membranes, current oscillation is usually very weak or absent, although seal-test currents become reduced as well (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E). After the penetration of perineurium, the tip of the recording pipette should be very close to the nodal axon (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E). To contact the nodal axon membranes, one only needs to slightly adjust the position of the recording pipette tip up and down in less than 1 μm until seeing the aforementioned changes of seal-test currents.\nGently push (1–2 μm) against the nodal axon with the tip of the recording electrode to allow the resistance of the seal test to increase to approximately 15 MΩ. This allows the recording pipette tip to optimally contact nodal membranes.\nGradually reduce the positive pressures in the recording pipette to negative pressures of −2 to −10 mmHg in approximately 10 s.\nWait for 30 s to 3 min until the formation of gigaohm seals (usually >5 GΩ) between the recording pipette and the axonal membranes at the node of Ranvier.\nCompensate the pipette capacitance before rupturing nodal axon membranes to form the whole-cell recording configuration.\nNote: At this point, one may perform single-channel recordings from the nodal axon membranes using the cell-attached recording configuration.",
    "Rupture the nodal axon membranes by applying a negative pressure of −30 mmHg combined with a train of short electrical pulses (± 200 mV, 20 ms each pulses) delivered to the nodal of Ranvier via the patch-clamp recording pipette.\nNote: Axonal membranes at the node of Ranvier usually can be ruptured by the short electrical pulses in less than 100 pulses leading to the whole-cell patch-clamp recording configuration. On the other hand, Schwann cells seems to have tougher cell membranes and require more than 300 times of electrical pulses to rapture their membranes to form the whole-cell patch-clamp recording configuration.\nAfter establishing the whole-cell patch-clamp recording configuration, quickly adjust the negative pressure from −30 mmHg to −5 mmHg. Keeping the lower negative pressure of −5 mmHg in the recording pipette can prevent nodal axon membranes from reseal at the recording pipette tip during experiments.\nStable recordings usually can last for more than 1 h.\nNote: The actual holding potential under the whole-cell patch-clamp recording configuration is −72 mV after the command holding potential of −60 mV is corrected for the junction potential of 12 mV.\nCritical: If recording electrode access resistance is increased over time after establishing the whole-cell patch-clamp recording configuration, it could be due to the gradual membrane reseal at the tip of the recording pipette. Return to step 22 and rupture the membrane again."
