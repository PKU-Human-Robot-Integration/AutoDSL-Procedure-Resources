    "The study was approved by the Italian National Institutes of Health Care and Use Committees, authorization number 493/2016-PR. All procedures were conducted per the guidelines of the European Community for the use of experimental animals (European Directive, 2010/63/UE).\nNote: Subcutaneous implantation of osmotic minipump containing vehicle (ethanol in saline solution) or aldosterone (240 µg · kg-1 · d-1) in 8-10 week-old male mice deficient for the ApoE gene. In general, 8-10 week-old male ApoE−/− mice weigh around 25-26 g.\n1. Dissolving Aldosterone\nDissolve 5 mg of aldosterone powder in 1 mL of absolute ethanol.\nAdd 56.7 µL of aldosterone (dissolved in ethanol) to 68.3 µL of saline solution in order to obtain a concentration of 2.27 µg/µL. Fill the entire osmotic minipumps completely with 125 µL of this solution (maximum capacity of each minipump is 125 µL).\nUse a minipump flow rate of 0.11 µL/h; therefore 2.64 µL of the solution is released every 24 h. Give each mouse around 6 µg · d-1 of aldosterone for 28 days.\n2. Osmotic Pump Filling and Implantation\nNote: Pumps are supplied in two separate parts: the main body of the pump and the flow regulator.\nFill and handle the minipumps using surgical gloves.\n\tNote: Skin oils may interfere with the performance of minipumps. The following steps should be performed in a sterile laminar flow hood.\nAttach the filling tube (supplied with the minipumps) to a 1 mL syringe and draw up the aldosterone solution or vehicle.\n\tNote: It is important to avoid letting air inside the syringe while aspirating solutions from the tube to prevent the formation of air bubbles into the pump.",
    "Insert the filling tube through the hole at the top of the minipump until it can go no further (Figure 1A-1B). Slowly fill the pump with the aldosterone or vehicle. Notice the dark shadow inside the pump indicating the fluid level. Watch this level rise along with the filling pump.\n\t\nStop filling the pump when a bead of fluid rises out of the pump body.\nCarefully remove the filling tube and insert the flow regulator into the body of the minipump (Figure 1C). Make sure that the regulator is seated tightly against the pump body. Leave the filled osmotic pumps in a beaker containing sterile saline solution at 37 °C for up to 24 h before implantation in the mouse (priming procedure).\nConduct surgery in a disinfected area with 70% ethanol that promotes asepsis.\nApply 1-3 drops at incision site of 0.25% bupivacaine and anesthetize the animal with 3% isoflurane. Turn on the supply gas and set the flowmeter to 500-1000 mL/min. Place the animal in the induction chamber and seal the top. Turn on the vaporizer to 5% isoflurane and monitor the mouse until recumbent.\n\t\nSwitch the system to flow to the nosecone. Remove the animal from the chamber and position in the nosecone. In 2-3 minutes, the mouse starts to awaken. Restart gas flow with the flowmeter at 100-200 mL/min and the vaporizer at 3% isoflurane.\nEnsure adequate depth of anesthesia prior to performing procedures by testing pedal withdrawal and palpebral reflexes. Monitor respiration and response to stimulation during the procedure and adjust vaporizer as needed.\nProtect the corneas from drying out by applying an ophthalmic ointment.\nPrepare the animal by removing hair from the surgical site using a razor (Figure 1D). The usual site for subcutaneous implantation of pumps is on the back.",
    "Prepare the surgical site with nonwoven pad material saturated with 70% isopropyl alcohol.\nUse a clean and dedicated space (disinfected with 70% ethanol) and covered with a sterile drape. Place the tip of the instruments in a glass bead sterilizer. Begin surgery with sterilized instruments and handle instruments aseptically.\nUse surgical scissors to make a 0.8-1 cm incision (around 2 cm close to the tail), as shown in Figures 1E-1F. Maintain sterility by not touching anything outside the surgical dedicated space with sterile gloves or tips of instruments.\nTake care to cut only the skin but not the underlying tissues. Use one hand to hold forceps to open the incision. Use the other hand to hold the trocar to spread the skin in order to create a pocket for the pump from the back upwards to the scapula (on the right or left side of the mouse).\nInsert the pump into the incision. Gently push the pump completely into the pocket (Figure 1H). There should be enough skin free to close the wound with no tension or stretching of the skin needed. Once the pump has been inserted, suture the incision with surgery wire (polyglactin 910 with suture size 6-0)\n\tNote: The head of the regulator must be oriented toward the front of the mouse (Figure 1G).\nApply topical 10% povidone/iodine ointment with a clean swab (Figure 1I) and keep the animal on a warming stage. Do not leave mice in unattended until they recover sternal recumbency. Evaluate the hydration status and administer 0.5 mL of 0.9% saline solution subcutaneously if necessary. Return the animal to its routine housing.",
    "Follow the institutional guidelines for documentation (e.g., fill a surgical form with operative and post-operative information, update cage card with procedure and date) and provide analgesics (buprenorphine, 0.05 mg/kg) to reduce post-surgical pain and antibiotics (enrofloxacin  85 mg/kg) to avoid post-surgical infection.\n\t\nContinue daily monitoring and examine for signs of pain. Pay attention that wound is completely closed and minipump is maintained into the subcutaneous pocket. The wound may open and the mouse may lose the minipump.\n3. Dissection of the Heart\nAt the time of sacrifice, anestethize mice with 80-100 mg/kg of Zoletil administered intramuscularly. Zoletil induces deep anesthesia. Note: check that mice are at an adequate depth of anesthesia prior to performing procedures by testing the pedal and palpebral reflexes; mice will be perfused while deeply anesthetized. Open the thoracic cavity, using scissors and forceps, by cutting the ribs laterally to the sternum, with the sternum being retracted toward the head.\nPerfuse mouse via the left ventricle by gravity perfusion system with 10-15 mL of ice-cold Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) and then with 40-50 mL of 10% of neutral buffered formalin to fix the vasculature. Fixation is indicated when the mice exhibit vigorous muscle contractions and become rigid.\n\tNote: The fixing process takes place in 10-20 min. It is possible to use the fixed organs and tissues to perform immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry analyses. Importantly, such fixed tissues cannot be used for gene expression and western blotting analyses.",
    "Separate the heart from the aorta by holding the heart with the forceps and cutting with either scissors or a scalpel blade, perpendicularly to the axis of the aorta, as close as possible to the heart without causing damage (Figure 2A). Use a scalpel blade to cut transversely along a straight line that joins the lower points of the right and left atrium (Figure 2B).\nFill the upper portion of the sectioned heart (through the cavity of the heart) with optimal cutting compound (OCT) (Figure 2D-2E). Put the tissue within a cryosection plastic mold with the axis of the aorta placed perpendicularly to the base of the rectangular mold and cover with OCT (Figure 2F). There should be no air bubble trapped. If any bubble is present, try to displace it to the edge.\nPlace a metal plate on dry ice and then carefully put the mold on (Figure 2G). When the OCT becomes white, wrap the mold with silver foil and then store at –80 °C.\n4. Cutting sections of the Aortic Root\nSet the cryostat machine to –20 °C. Before cutting, place the embedded tissue and leave it there for about 15 min to adjust to this temperature. Set the specimen holder temperature to -17 °C (Figure 3A).\nPlace the frozen heart block inside the cryostat machine to equilibrate the temperature of the block to that of the cryostat (Figure 3B) and take out the frozen heart block from the mold (Figure 3C). Cut the excess OCT from the frozen block to better adapt the block dimensions to the specimen holder (Figure 3D).",
    "Mount the frozen heart block on the specimen holder oriented with the ventricular facing outward (Figure 3E-3I) and insert the specimen holder into the specimen orienting head (Figure 3J). Adjust the orientation of the specimen holder to allow cutting of the block in order to make the aortic root perpendicular to the blade (Figure 3K).\nCut the block and discard slices until the aortic root is reached (Figure 3L-3N). Collect serial sections and place them on the glass slides (Figure 3O). Monitor the aortic root anatomical profile under the microscope until all 3 aortic valves appear (Figure 3P-3Q).\nCollect sections at 10 µm/section for Oil Red O and Picro Sirius Red staining, and at 6 µm/section for MAC3 staining (Figure 3R). Collect around 6-8 slides (for each heart) until one of the three valves disappears or is not intact anymore.\n5. Immunohistochemistry\nNote: All staining steps reported in the following protocols are performed in glass Coplin staining jars.\nOil Red O Stain for Neutral Fats\nFix sections in 70 mL of 37% formaldehyde for 5 min. Wash well in tap water and blot off excess water.\nDilute 48 mL of Oil Red O (0.5% in isopropanol) in 32 mL of distilled water to obtain Oil Red O 0.3%.\nStain sections in 70 mL of Oil Red O 0.3% for 10 min. Wash sections in tap water for 10 min.\nStain for 1 min in 70 mL of Mayer’s Hematoxylin. Wash sections in tap water for 1 min.\nImmerse sections in 70 mL of 0.5% lithium carbonate. Wash in tap water for 1 min.\nMount sections with an aqueous mounting medium and capture images using a digital camera mounted on a light microscope.\nPicro Sirius Red Stain for Collagen",

Air dry.\nPlace briefly in 70 mL of 70% ethanol.\nWhen completely dry, place in 70 mL of clearing agent of terpene origin and mount sections using poly(butyl methacrylate-co-methyl methacrylate) based mounting medium and capture images using a digital camera mounted on a light microscope.\n\t\tNote: One of the advantages of the Picro Sirius Red staining is that it is possible to distinguish the Type I (thick fibers, Yellow-Orange birefringence) and Type III (thin fibers, Green birefringence) collagen fiber networks by polarized light microscopy11.\nMac3 Stain for Macrophage Staining\nCut 6 µm frozen sections and mount in the bottom of the slide.\nFix sections in 70 mL of cold acetone for 5 min. Immerse in 70 mL of PBS for 2 min.\nUsing a pipette, cover sections with 1% of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution and incubate for 5 min at room temperature (RT) for antigen retrieval. Immerse in 70 mL of PBS for 5 min.\nUsing a pipette, cover the slices with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 20 min. Wash in 70 mL of PBS 3 times for 5 min.\nUse Avidin-Biotin Complexes (ABC)-HRP Kit for the following steps.\nUsing a pipette, block sections in Normal Rabbit serum at room temperature for 20 min.
