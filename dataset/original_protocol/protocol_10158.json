    "1. ELP Expression Protocol\nDay 1: Growing the starter colony\nPrepare ampicillin and chloramphenicol agar plates by autoclaving 25 g of Luria broth and 15 g of agar per 1 L of ultrapure water. Once the solution has cooled to ~60 °C, add 1 mL of ampicillin stock (100 mg/mL in ultrapure water) and 1 mL of chloramphenicol stock (34 mg/mL in 70% ethanol) to 1 L of agar solution for final concentrations of 100 µg/mL and 34 µg/mL, respectively. Transfer 20 mL of final solution to 10 cm Petri dishes with a serological pipette and allow the agar to solidify. Wrap the Petri dishes with parafilm and store at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Petri dishes can be stored at 4 °C for up to two weeks.\nStreak a small sample of BL21(DE3)pLysS E. coli from a pre-made bacterial stock containing a pET15b vector encoding the ELP of interest on an ampicillin and chloramphenicol agar plate.\n\t\tNOTE: The ampicillin and chloramphenicol select for bacteria containing both the pET15b and pLysS vectors, respectively.\nPlace the streaked plate upside down in an incubator at 37 °C. Allow the bacterial colonies to grow overnight.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not incubate the plates for longer than 16 h as ampicillin will degrade and the colonies that do not carry ampicillin resistance can form.\nDay 2: Preparation of the starter culture and expression media\nRemove the E. coli culture from the incubator. Parafilm the plate and store for a maximum of 4 days at 4 °C.\nPrepare a starter culture flask (250 mL) and expression culture flasks (12x 1 L) and autoclave. For 1 L of expression media, add 47.6 g of terrific broth and 4 mL of glycerol to 1 L of ultrapure water in a 2 L baffled culture flask, and cap with aluminum foil.",
    "NOTE: Typical yields are 60-100 mg/L protein of expression media.\nLoad the autoclaved starter into pre-warmed, 37 °C shaking incubator and incubate without agitation.\nAdd 250 µL of sterile-filtered (0.22 µm filter) ampicillin stock (100 mg/mL in ultrapure water) to the starter culture for a final concentration of 100 µg/mL. Immediately begin agitating the starter culture at 250 rpm.\n\t\tNOTE: Chloramphenicol is only used for colony selection on agar plates and is not included for liquid cultures.\nInoculate the starter culture by adding a single ELP plasmid-containing E. coli colony from the streaked plate and allow the starter culture to shake at 37 °C for 16 h.\nPlace the expression culture media flasks into pre-warmed, 37 °C shaking incubators and incubate overnight without agitation so that the flasks are ready to inoculate the next morning.\nDay 3: Inducing protein expression in E. coli\nMake fresh, sterile-filtered ampicillin stock (100 mg/mL in ultrapure water). Add 1 mL of ampicillin stock to each flask of expression media for a final concentration of 100 µg/mL.\nBegin agitating the expression media at 250 rpm.\nTake a 2 mL sample of the media from any expression flask and add to a cuvette as a blank for an optical density reading at 600 nm (OD600).\nAfter the completion of 16 h starter culture incubation, inoculate each expression flask by transferring 20 mL of the starter culture to each expression flask via a serological pipette.\nAfter the completion of 1 h agitation, measure the OD600 of one of the expression flasks. Following this step, measure the OD600 every 20 min, checking a different flask each time.\nAt an OD600 of 0.6, reduce the temperature of the shakers containing the expression flasks to 32 °C.",
    "Check the OD600 every 10 min. At an OD600 of 0.8, induce the expression by adding 1 mL of 1 M, sterile-filtered β-isopropyl thiogalactoside (IPTG) in ultrapure water to each expression flask.\nAllow the E. coli in expression flasks to express for 7 h.\n20 min prior to the end of expression, pre-cool a large floor centrifuge to 4 °C.\nCollect all 12 L of expression media into individual centrifuge containers and balance.\nCentrifuge the expression media at >12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C using a floor centrifuge.\nPour off the supernatant from each centrifuge container. Using a spatula, collect the cell pellets into a pre-weighed zip lock bag.\nRe-suspend the pellet in sterile-filtered TEN buffer (100 mL of buffer per 25 g of pellet) and remove any excess air bubbles by massaging the pellet. For 1 L of TEN buffer, add 5.8 g of sodium chloride, 1.21 g of tris base, and 0.37 g of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) disodium salt dihydrate to 900 mL of ultrapure water. Adjust the pH to 8.0 and bring to 1 L. For this step, pH strips are sufficient.\nPlace the zip-lock bag containing the re-suspended cell pellet into a secondary container and freeze at -80 °C overnight.\nDay 4-6: Rupturing the bacterial cell wall via freeze-thaw cycles\nRemove the frozen pellet from the freezer and allow it to slowly thaw at 4 °C with gentle agitation using an orbital shaker.\nAllow the pellet to thaw until some liquid is present. Add ~30-40 mg of deoxyribonuclease I (DNase) to thawed lysate. Additionally, add 1 mL of 100 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF; a protease inhibitor) in isopropanol per 100 mL of cell lysate. Allow the lysate to shake overnight.",
    "NOTE: Adding the DNase and PMSF is only necessary for the first freeze-thaw cycle.\n\t\tCAUTION: PMSF is toxic if inhaled. A face mask should be used when handling PMSF powder.\nOnce the cell lysate is completely thawed, freeze the lysate at -80 °C overnight, or until completely frozen.\nRepeat the freeze-thaw procedure for a total of three cycles. Leave the lysate thawed at 4 °C after the last freeze-thaw. Store 100 µL of raw lysate for sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis at the conclusion of purification.\nAfter the last thaw, adjust the pH of the thawed lysate to 9.0 using 1 M NaOH. For this step, pH strips are sufficient. Incubate at 4 °C for at least 1 h (overnight is appropriate) on an orbital shaker.\nDay 7-9: ELP purification via cold and hot spin thermal cycling\nCool the floor centrifuge to 4 °C 20 min prior to centrifugation.\nAliquot and balance the thawed lysate into centrifuge containers.\nCentrifuge the samples at >15,000 x g for 1 h at 4 °C. Store 100 µL of the supernatant for SDS-PAGE analysis after the completion of purification.\n\t\tNOTE: After centrifuging, the ELP protein should remain in the supernatant due to its high solubility in water at temperatures below its LCST (<32 °C).\nTransfer the supernatant to new centrifuge containers and balance appropriately.\nAdd sodium chloride (NaCl) in three parts to a final concentration of 1 M (5.84 g of NaCl for every 100 mL of the supernatant). Ensure that NaCl is added in three parts to allow for sufficient dissolution.\nAgitate for 3 h at 37 °C at 250 rpm in a shaking incubator.\n1 h before the end of agitation, pre-warm a floor centrifuge to 37°C.",
    "Centrifuge at >15,000 x g for 1 h at 37 °C. Store 100 µL of the supernatant for SDS-PAGE analysis after the completion of purification and discard the remaining supernatant.\n\t\tNOTE: After centrifuging, the ELP protein should be pelleted due to its low solubility in water at temperatures above its LCST (>32 °C).\nRe-suspend the pellet by adding 10 mL of autoclaved, ultrapure water per 1 g of pellet. Use a metal spatula to mash the pellet to aid in the dissolution of the protein.\nAdjust the pH of the thawed lysate to 9.0 using 1 M NaOH. For this step, pH strips are sufficient.\nAgitate overnight at 4 °C on an orbital shaker.\nRepeat the cold and hot spin thermal cycling procedure for a total of three cycles (i.e., repeat steps 1.5.1 through 1.5.11 for three total cycles).\nDay 10-15: ELP dialysis and lyophilization\nCentrifuge the re-suspended pellet in a pre-chilled centrifuge at >15,000 x g for 1 h at 4 °C. Store 100 µL of the supernatant for SDS-PAGE analysis after the completion of purification.\nDesalt the protein solution by dialyzing the remaining supernatant in a 3.5 kDa dialysis membrane against 4 L of pre-chilled ultrapure water at 4 °C. Change the dialysis water twice a day for a total of 6 times over 3 days.\n\t\tNOTE: Typical supernatant volumes are between 5 and 30 mL.\nCentrifuge the dialyzed solution in a pre-cooled centrifuge at >15,000 x g for 1 h at 4 °C. Store 100 µL of the supernatant for SDS-PAGE analysis at the end of the purification.\nFreeze the resulting supernatant at -80 °C in pre-weighed conical tubes.\nLyophilize the frozen solution for 3 days and mass the final product to determine the protein yield.",
    "Parafilm the tubes containing the final lyophilized ELP product and store at 4 °C.\nRun SDS-PAGE to determine the purity of the protein.\n\t\tNOTE: Protocols for SDS-PAGE will vary based on specific agarose gel conditions. For our experiments, final lyophilized protein was dissolved to a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL in deionized water and run at 140 V for 70-100 min in a 12% (w/v) acrylamide gel under denaturing conditions.\n2. Cell Encapsulation in 3D Elastin-like Protein Hydrogels\nPreparation of silicone molds\nUse a biopsy punch with the desired diameter to create holes in a 0.5 mm thick silicone sheet and cut out a square around each hole. Repeat for the number of molds desired.\n\t\tNOTE: The diameter and thickness of the molds can be adjusted for the particular application and cell culture conditions. In practice, for cell cultures of 50 106 cells/mL, 0.5 mm thick molds with 4 mm and 5 mm diameters are recommended for sufficient DNA/RNA and protein extraction, respectively. For immunostaining, a 2 mm biopsy punch can be used to instead create three adjacent holes per square mold so that three replicates can be stained per well.\nRemove the plastic wrap on each side of the individual mold with tweezers.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid contact with the exposed silicone surface as contamination can decrease future plasma bonding efficiency.\nUsing tweezers, arrange the same number of bare silicone molds and glass coverslips (No. 1, 12 mm diameter) in alternating rows on the inverted lid of a 48-well plate. Once completed, cover the lid of the 48-well plate to avoid contamination.",
    "Oxygen plasma treat the entire 48-well plate lid (i.e., molds and glass slides). Immediately after, use forceps to invert the silicone mold onto the adjacent glass coverslip. Press firmly on the mold to ensure bonding. Let the molds incubate at room temperature for 1 h.\n\t\tNOTE: The duration of oxygen plasma treatment will vary depending on the instrument used. Typical conditions for our instrument are an operating gas pressure window between 0.3-4 mbar, oxygen gas flow at 20 cm3/min, and sample exposure to plasma for 10-20 s.\nSterilize the molds by autoclaving. Store the molds at room temperature in a sterile environment until use.\n\t\tNOTE: The molds can be stored at this stage indefinitely.\nPreparation of elastin-like protein stock solution\nRemove lyophilized ELP from 4 °C storage. Warm the protein to room temperature before opening the tube to ensure no condensation builds on the protein over repeated use.\nDissolve ELP in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) at 4 °C with constant agitation (i.e., spinning) overnight.\n\t\tNOTE: ELP stock solution concentration will be further diluted with the addition of crosslinker solution at a user-defined volumetric ratio. For example, for a 3% (w/v) final ELP concentration, prepare a 3.75% (w/v) ELP stock solution that will be diluted at a 4:1 volumetric ratio of ELP solution:crosslinker solution. Adjust the concentration as necessary for desired application.\nSterile filter ELP stock solution using a 0.22 µm syringe filter. Store ELP on ice when not in use.\nIn the biosafety cabinet, transfer the sterile molds using sterile tweezers to a 24-well tissue-culture plate.\nPreparation of THPC stock solution\nDilute THPC in DPBS just prior to use. Adjust the concentration of THPC solution according to the final ELP concentration and desired crosslinking ratio.",
    "NOTE: For the protocol, a final ELP concentration of 3% (w/v) will be made by mixing the ELP stock solution with the THPC solution at a volumetric ratio of 4:1. Adjust as necessary.\nAdd 2.6 µL of THPC solution (80% in water) to 997.4 µL of DPBS.\n\t\tNOTE: This concentration of THPC corresponds to a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio of hydroxy methyl groups on THPC and primary amines on the ELP protein when mixing solutions at the described 4:1 volumetric ratio for a final 3% (w/v) ELP hydrogel. The THPC solution is viscous and droplets of solution may stick to the side of the pipette tip. For accurate concentrations, avoid such droplets when diluting into DPBS. Purge the THPC stock container with nitrogen gas to prevent oxidation of the phosphine and inactivation of the crosslinker.\nVortex the solution to mix and keep on ice.\nSterile filter the THPC stock solution using a 0.22 µm syringe filter. Dilute the THPC stock solution further with sterile DPBS to achieve lower stoichiometric crosslinking ratios (e.g., 0.5:1 or 0.75:1).\n\t\tNOTE: THPC is oxygen-sensitive, and the diluted solution should be used within a few hours after preparation.\nDissociate the cells by incubation with Trypsin-EDTA into a single-cell suspension, pellet the cells, and count the cells re-suspended in medium using a hemocytometer.\n\tNOTE: Exact protocols for this step will depend heavily on desired cell type and application. For the neural progenitor cells used throughout this protocol, a 0.025% Trypsin-EDTA incubation at room temperature for 1.5 min was conducted. The cells were pelleted at 200 x g for 2 min. For increased cell viability, cells should be suspended in normal medium conditions. Typical cell densities used for cell encapsulation range from 1 - 50 106 cells/mL of final hydrogel volume. Adjust as necessary.",
    "Aliquot the desired number of cells into a sterile 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the cells at ~200 x g for 3 min. Carefully, aspirate the supernatant and keep the cell pellet on ice.\n\tNOTE: It is critical to completely aspirate all the supernatant to mitigate the further dilution of the ELP and THPC crosslinker. Specific centrifugation speeds will vary with cell type.\nRe-suspend the cell pellet in the ELP stock solution such that the volume is 80% of the final volume (assuming a 4:1 ratio of ELP solution:THPC solution). Pipette mix 20-25 times to produce a homogenous mixture of the cells and ELP.\n\tNOTE: Avoid gripping the bottom of the tube to mitigate temperature increase and subsequent phase transition of ELP. Each 2 mm mold with three replicates requires 7.5 µL of final volume (i.e., 6 µL of ELP stock solution and 1.5 µL of THPC stock solution) divided equally into the 3 holes (i.e., 2.5 µL final volume per hole). For the 4 and 5 mm molds, a final volume of 7.5 µL and 15.5 µL is required, respectively.\nAdd THPC stock solution to the cell/ELP suspension for the remaining 20% final volume. Pipette mix 20-25 times to produce a homogenous mixture.\nImmediately pipette the corresponding final volumes of cell/ELP/THPC mixture into each mold by a circular motion. Repeat for all molds.\nIncubate the samples at room temperature for 15 min, followed by an additional incubation at 37 °C for 15 min.\n\tNOTE: The first incubation period will help facilitate initial crosslinking of the hydrogel before increasing the temperature to that above the ELP's LCST and inducing its thermal phase segregation.\nSlowly add 750 µL of warm cell culture medium to each well of the 24-well plate, avoiding disrupting the gels.",
    "Incubate the hydrogels at 37 °C for 7 days.\n\tNOTE: Full medium changes are recommended every 1-2 days depending on cell type. To limit the stress on the gel, use a glass Pasteur pipette affixed with a 200 µL pipette tip when aspirating medium from the well.\n3. Immunocytochemistry of Cells in 3D ELP Hydrogels\nPrepare the fixation solution by mixing 10 mL 16% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 30 of mL DPBS. Warm the solution to 37 °C.\nAspirate the medium from the 24-well plate and gently wash with 1 mL of DPBS.\nAdd 750 µL of the fixation solution to each well and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min. Do not use the tissue culture incubator to avoid contamination of other cultures with PFA vapor.\nCarefully aspirate the fixation solution from each well, discarding the PFA to an appropriate hazardous waste container.\n\tCAUTION: Exposure to PFA can cause skin and eye irritation. Wear gloves/safety glasses and work in a chemical fume hood.\nAdd 1 mL of DPBS to each sample. Immediately aspirate the DPBS and discard into PFA waste container.\nWash the samples twice with 1 mL of DPBS for 10 min each.\n\tNOTE: Samples can be stored in DPBS at 4 °C for up to a week after sealing the plate with Parafilm.\nPermeabilize each sample with 750 µL of permeabilization solution (100 mL of DPBS and 0.25 mL of Triton X-100; PBST) for 1 h at room temperature on a rocker at 15 rpm.\nAspirate the PBST and add 750 µL of blocking solution (95 mL of PBS, 5 g of bovine serum albumin (BSA), 5 mL of serum, and 0.5 mL of Triton X-100) to each sample. Incubate at room temperature for 3 h on a rocker at 15 rpm.",
    "NOTE: The blocking solution should contain serum from the host species in which the secondary antibodies were raised (e.g., goat, donkey) and sterile-filtered through a 0.22 µm filter prior to use.\nPrepare the antibody dilution solution (97 mL of DPBS, 2.5 g of BSA, 2.5 mL of serum (from same host species as in step 3.8), and 0.5 mL of Triton X-100). Dilute the primary antibody using the antibody dilution solution and add 500 µL of the solution to each sample. Seal the plate with Parafilm and incubate overnight at 4 °C on a rocker.\n\tNOTE: Nestin and Sox2 primary antibodies were diluted 1:400 in antibody dilution solution from the manufacturers' original concentration.\nAspirate the antibody solution from each sample and wash the samples with PBST for 60 min at room temperature on a rocker at 15 rpm. Repeat the wash step 3 times.\nDilute the secondary antibodies and 5 mg/mL stock DAPI (1:2,000) using the antibody dilution solution and add 500 µL of the solution to each sample. Cover the 24-well plate with aluminum foil and incubate overnight at 4 °C on a rocker.\n\tNOTE: As the secondary antibodies are light sensitive, the samples must be protected from photobleaching for all subsequent steps. Goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were diluted 1:500 in antibody dilution solution from the manufacturers' original concentration.\nAspirate the antibody solution from each sample and wash the samples with PBST for 30 min at room temperature on the rocker. Repeat the wash step 3 times.\nPosition a drop of hard-set mounting medium onto the surface of a glass slide. Using forceps, remove excess solution from the mold by lightly blotting the edge of the mold on a paper towel. Carefully place the mold upside down onto the mounting medium and avoid introducing bubbles.",
    "Allow the mounting medium to harden for 48 h at room temperature. Store the samples at room temperature or 4 °C. Allow the mounting medium to fully set for 48 h before imaging as refractive index of the medium will change over the course of hardening. Seal the samples to the glass cover slide with clear nail polish to mitigate contamination or sample movement.\nImage the samples using a confocal microscope.\nSubscription Required.
