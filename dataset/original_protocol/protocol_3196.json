Embryos are collected in 1-h time intervals to ensure an equal\n      distribution of embryos across the developmental time window. In this\n      protocol, we detail the steps to study the first 3 h of embryonic\n      development. Embryos are dechorionated, washed, and frozen. To obtain\n      total RNA from individual embryos, RNA is isolated using a miniaturized\n      version of a standard TRIzol protocol. At the end of these steps, total\n      RNA from 192 individual embryos will be obtained.\n    \n        Prepare tubes for embryo collection.\n        \n            Weight 0.2 g ± 0.02 of 1.4 mm ceramic beads (lysing matrix D) into\n            192 2 mL screw-cap tubes.\n          \n            Label each tube on both the side and the lid, as later steps might\n            remove the labels.\n            \n                Label each of the 192 tubes with a prefix for the collection\n                time interval (1, 2, or 3), and the embryo number (1–64). For\n                example, label 2.15 corresponds to the 15th embryo\n                collected from the 2-h collection window.\n              \nAlternatives: 2 mL screw-cap tubes\n      already pre-filled with 1.4 mm ceramic beads can be purchased instead.\n    \n        Collect embryos in three 1-h time intervals (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2967-Fig1.jpg\n              Figure 1. Embryo collection diagram\n            \n            Before collecting the first study timepoint, exchange the food plate\n            twice, each after a 1-h interval, and discard embryos. This step\n            allows females to lay withheld (older) embryos, before the actual\n            study begins.\n          \n            Replace the first study plate with a new food plate and incubate the\n            embryos on the first plate for 2 h at 25°C and 60% humidity, before\n            proceeding to step 3. These will be your 2–3 h old embryos.\n          \n            Exchange the next food plate and proceed to step 3 immediately.",
    "These will be your 0–1 h old embryos.\n          \n            Remove the final food plate and incubate for 1 h at 25°C and 60%\n            humidity, before proceeding to step 3. These will be your 1–2 h old\n            embryos.\n          \nNote: To make food plates, heat fly food\n      in a beaker using a microwave and transfer 10 mL to petri dishes\n      (60 × 15 mm). Let them cool uncovered for 20 min at room temperature in a\n      clean room. Cover petri dishes and store at 4°C for up to 1 month.\n    \nOptional: To assess the fertility rate\n      of the parents, collect additional embryos the same day. The fertility\n      rate is specific for your fly strain and experimental conditions, and it\n      is used to estimate the number of unfertilized eggs expected in the\n      experiment. Transfer at least 150 eggs to a petri dish with enough\n      MilliQ-grade water to cover all embryos. Incubate at 25°C with 60%\n      humidity. Count the number of hatched larvae after 48-h. Calculate the\n      fertility rate by dividing the number of larvae hatched by the total\n      number of eggs and multiply by 100. For example, if 132 larvae hatched\n      from 150 eggs (132/150∗100) this would equal to 88% fertility. This\n      percentage will allow you to estimate the number of unfertilized eggs\n      expected in your final dataset. Unfertilized eggs will be excluded during\n      data analysis (see step 36).\n    \n        Wash embryos.\n        \n            Add some egg-wash solution to the food plate and use a paintbrush\n            (size 1/8) to gently loosen the embryos from the food. Pour the\n            egg-wash solution, including the embryos, from the food plate onto a\n            150 μM mesh-size cell strainer (pluriStrainer).\n          \n            Rinse the embryos on cell strainer with tap water for at least 15 s.\n            Use a wash bottle to control the water pressure and avoid losing\n            embryos.",
    "Place the strainer into the lid of a 50 mL centrifuge tube and add\n            3% sodium hypochlorite so that all embryos are completely submerged,\n            and incubate for 4 min. Use only freshly prepared solution (maximum\n            storage time: 1 month).\n          \n            Rinse the embryos with tap water for at least 15 s using a wash\n            bottle.\n          \n            Soak the embryos in egg-wash solution for 1 min, as described for\n            step 3.c.\n          \n            Wash the embryos with MilliQ-grade water for 15 s using a wash\n            bottle.\n          \n        Snap-freeze embryos using dry ice.\n        \n            Transfer each single embryo into a pre-labeled 2 mL tube (prepared\n            in step 1) using a liner brush (size 20/0). Place embryos in the\n            middle of the tube to avoid accidental lysis with the ceramic beads\n            during storage.\n          \nPlace the tube on dry ice. Avoid shaking.\nAfter processing all samples, store embryos at −80°C.\nPause point: Embryos collected can\n      be stored at −80°C until RNA isolation. We have stored samples for up to 1\n      year, however, RNA is prone to degradation and samples should be used as\n      soon as possible. To avoid possible batch effects due to different storage\n      times, embryos from all experimental conditions need to be included in\n      each batch.\n    \nCritical: TRIzol is a mixture of\n      volatile hazardous chemicals. All steps involving an opened tube\n      containing TRIzol should be performed using a chemical fume hood.\n    \nNote: We recommend processing no more than\n      24 samples for RNA isolation at the same time.\n    \n        Homogenize embryos.\n        \n            Remove the embryo samples from −80°C freezer and place them on ice.\n          \n            Add 500 μL TRIzol reagent into each tube.

    "Air-dry samples until completely dry (approximately 20 min).\nStore RNA pellets at −80°C.\nNote: To practice and confirm that RNA can\n      be successfully isolated, use several spare samples and quantify the total\n      RNA yield. Total RNA from a single embryo in the first 3 h of development\n      should be ∼50 ng (∼10 ng/μL from a 5 μL RNA elution).\n    \nCEL-Seq2 protocol\nTiming: 5 days\n      This major step describes a modification of a previously published\n      single-cell sequencing protocol (CEL-seq2)2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] that has been modified to\n      work with single embryos. Major adjustments to the original protocol\n      include: 1) using RNA as a starting point, instead of intact single cells;\n      2) diluting cDNA concentration by 20-fold prior to library PCR. The\n      protocol described below is suited for working with the I.DOT non-contact\n      liquid handler and 96-well source plates (S.100, 100 μm pore). At the end\n      of the protocol, two DNA libraries will have been created, each containing\n      96 individual embryo samples. An overview of this major step is shown in\n      Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\n    \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2967-Fig2.jpg\n          Figure 2.

This can cause the formation of small\n                  droplets at the pores over time that lead to inaccurate\n                  dispensing. Therefore, Vapor-Lock dispensing with the I.DOT\n                  should be done as quickly as possible.

A short Read\n              1 is not supported by Illumina; the demultiplexing requires a\n              special command (--mask-short-adapter-reads 0) in bcl2fastq in\n              order for the reads to process properly.\n            \nSequencing data processing\nTiming: 1 day\n      This major step describes RNA-seq data alignment and demultiplexing using\n      STAR (Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference)4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]\n      and the CEL-Seq2 barcode sequences, respectively. This step creates a\n      table with the deduplicated reads per gene per barcode (embryo). The code\n      for each step can be found here, on\n      Zenodo[href=https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8190517], and on our\n      GitHub[href=https://github.com/Lempradl/PerezMojica2023_STARProtocols]\n      repository.\n    \nNote: When doing read alignment and\n      processing to obtain a read counts matrix, working on a Linux-based system\n      with >100Gb of memory and >16 available cores, such as is generally\n      found on a High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster, is recommended.\n    \n        Align sequencing data to reference genome using STAR.\n        \n            Index a reference genome.\n            \nNote: Before STAR can be used to\n              align reads to a reference genome, the genome must first be\n              indexed.

For example, the embryo\n                development increases from left to right and from up to down in\n                the sample dataset, as shown by the expression pattern of\n                scw and ths in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\n              \n            Identify unfertilized embryos by visual inspection of the t-SNE\n            maps.\n            \n                Identify any samples that have no or very low expression of\n                scw, sc, and esg, but that are in the midst\n                of embryos that are expressing these genes. These samples are\n                unfertilized eggs.

In our data,\n                  the extensive transcriptional changes during development led\n                  samples to assemble into a linear pattern. At the beginning of\n                  development, embryos and unfertilized eggs follow the same\n                  linear pattern in the t-SNE map because maternal mRNA decay is\n                  the dominant process. The outlined approach only identifies\n                  unfertilized eggs once transcription starts.\n                \nNote: It is possible to miss\n                  some unfertilized eggs due to overlap with other samples in\n                  the t-SNE map.

Keep the reagents on\n            ice until use. This volume is enough for 96 reactions (44 samples\n            and 4 no template control, all in duplicate).\n          \n            Use the primers to amplify the X-chromosome first. The amplification\n            of the Y chromosome is done separately. The primer sequences for the\n            X and the Y chromosome are listed on the\n            key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table].\n            table:files/protocols_protocol_2967_16.csv\n            Vortex qPCR reaction master mix for 5 s and spin tube for 5 s at\n            ≤2000 × g.\n          \n            Pipette 8 μL qPCR reaction master mix into each well of a 96-well\n            PCR plate on ice.\n          \n            Add 2 μL nuclease-free water to 8 wells distributed across the\n            plate.\n            \nUse a new pipette tip for each control and duplicate.\nKeep the plate on ice during this process.\nCarefully note the location of these control wells.",
    "Add 2 μL of DNA sample to the rest of the wells (one sample per\n            well).\n            \n                Include a technical duplicate for every sample. A maximum of 44\n                different samples can be process per 96-well plate.\n              \nUse a new pipette tip for each sample and duplicate.\nKeep plate on ice during this process.\n            Seal the plate with a Microseal 'B' PCR seal, gently tap to\n            mix, and spin plate for 30 s at ≤850 × g.\n          \n            Incubate the plate in a thermocycler with the lid temperature set at\n            105°C and perform qPCR using the following program:\n            table:files/protocols_protocol_2967_17.csv\nRemove plate from the thermocycler and discard.\n            Get qPCR data from the instrument and analyze it to get the cycle\n            threshold (Ct) values.\n          \n            Repeat the process for the rest of the X and all of the Y chromosome\n            reactions. A total of four 96-well plates are needed to amplify both\n            sex chromosomes on 84 samples in duplicate.\n          \n            Determine the sex of each embryo using the qPCR data.\n            \n                Ensure the melting curve for each sample has one peak at\n                83.5°C–84°C for the X-chromosome and one at 80°C–80.5°C for the\n                Y-chromosome. An example of the melt peak for each chromosome is\n                shown in Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]. If these peaks are not\n                observed, the data should be excluded or/and the qPCR should be\n                repeated for that sample.\n              \n                Make the threshold for Ct values the same for all samples and\n                chromosomes.\n              \n                Compare the Y-chromosome Ct values to the X-chromosome Ct values\n                in each sample. Male embryos have similar Ct values (±2.5) for\n                both sex chromosomes while female embryos only amplify the\n                X-chromosome. Refer to problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9] in the\n                troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section if the\n                difference between Ct values is more than 2.5 and amplification\n                has occurred.\n              \n                Designate all reactions with a difference >1.5 between the Ct",
    "values of technical replicates as an inconsistent result. See\n                problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11] in the\n                troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section for\n                options to address this.\n              \n            Repeat qPCR for any samples with an inconsistent result between\n            replicates.\n            \nNote: No amplification of the Y\n              chromosome indicates the embryo is female. The X-chromosome\n              amplification reaction is performed to verify the successful\n              extraction of DNA for all samples. In addition, the X- and\n              Y-chromosome Ct values should be the same in male embryos,\n              however, in our experience we consider differences of up to 2.5 in\n              Ct values between the X- and Y-chromosome amplification reaction\n              as normal due to differences in primer efficiencies and batch\n              effects. A greater difference likely indicates contamination in\n              one of the reactions.\n            \n        Determine differentially expressed transcripts between male and female\n        embryos using splineTimeR.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]\nInstall the splineTimeR R package.\n            Create a csv file with the name 'metadata'.\n            \n                Use the 1st column for sample IDs in pseudo-time\n                order. Set the column name to 'SampleName'.\n              \n                Use the 2nd column for cluster number reorganized in\n                ascending order according to the developmental trajectory. Set\n                the column name to 'Time'.\n              \n                Use the 3rd column for the sex of each embryo. Set\n                the column name to 'Treatment'.\n              \n                Use the 4th column for the different number of\n                females or males included in each cluster. Set the column name\n                to 'Replicate'.\n              \n                Exclude all samples with undetermined sex from the metadata\n                file. For our sample data, 61 out of 84 samples were included in\n                the analysis (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]).\n              \n            Create a file with the normalize read counts for each sample\n            included in the metadata file.\n            \n> norm.counts\n                  <-read.csv(\"06normalized_counts_by_pseudotime.csv\",\n                  sep=\",\",\nheader=TRUE, row.names = 1)\n>\n> m.data <- read.csv(\"metadata.csv\",\n                  sep=\",\", header=TRUE)\n>\n> sample_list <- m.data[,1]\n> norm.counts <- norm.counts[,sample_list]\n> row.names(m.data) <- m.data[,1]\nNote: The\n              '06normalized_counts_by_pseudotime.csv' file was",

Comparisons of the\n              shape of the curves and expression levels between male and female\n              embryos allows for the identification of differentially expressed\n              genes.
