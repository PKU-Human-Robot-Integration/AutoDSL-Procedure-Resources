Remove 12.5 µl of the autophosphorylated Hik2 protein and add 3 µl of Laemmli sample buffer to stop the reactions. Label this tube as T0.For each phosphotransfer reaction, take 62.5 µl of the autophosphorylated radiolabeled Hik2 protein from step F1 and mix it with 62.5 µl of the response regulator or with the water control from steps F3 and F4. Kinase and response regulator should be present at a concentration of 1 µM and 5 µM, respectively. Mix briefly by vortexing and incubated at 30 °C. Remove 25 µl samples at 20, 40, 60, and 90 min and add 6 µl of Laemmli sample buffer to stop the reactions. Resolve the proteins on 15% SDS-PAGE and visualized the presence of γ-32P using autoradiography.Table 3.
