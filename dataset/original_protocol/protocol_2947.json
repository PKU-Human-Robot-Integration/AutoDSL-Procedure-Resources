Tissue dissection\n(A) Remove the amnion by placing the placenta with the fetal surface facing upwards and manually peeling off the amnion from the chorion, peeling towards the umbilical cord. Remove and discard the amnion completely.\n(B) Decidua parietalis collection is done by gently scraping the decidua parietalis from the chorionic membrane using sterile curved tip forceps.\n(C) To collect decidua basalis and villous tissues, turn over the placenta to have the maternal side basal plate with cotyledons facing upwards and carefully cut thin pieces from the placenta basal plate with sterile scissors.\n(D–E) carefully remove villi from decidua basalis with scissors until (F–G) decidua basalis is a clean 1–2 mm thin membrane. Collect 20–50 mL of each tissue in a 50 mL conical containing 1× PBS.\nRemove and discard the amnion completely.\nCollect decidua parietalis by gently scraping the decidua parietalis from the chorion using sterile curved tip forceps (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nAvoid necrotic tissue and blood clots.\nCollect 20–50 mL of tissue in a labelled 50 mL conical tube containing 1× PBS.\nObtain decidua basalis and villous tissues by turning over the placenta to have the maternal surface (basal plate with cotyledons) facing upwards.\nCarefully cut thin pieces of approximately L 2 × W 1 × H 0.5 cm3 from the placenta basal plate using sterile scissors (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nAvoid necrotic tissue and blood clots.\nThen carefully remove villi from the decidua basalis with scissors.",
    "Collect villi in a labelled 50 mL conical tube containing 1× PBS.\nRemove all villi until decidua basalis is a clean 1–2 mm thin membrane (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D–1G).\nCollect 20–50 mL villi and 20–50 mL decidua basalis in labelled 50 mL conical tube containing 1× PBS.\nFor first trimester decidual tissue, macroscopically separate decidual tissue from villi. Avoid necrotic tissue. Collect 10–30 mL of tissue in a 50 mL conical tube containing 1× PBS.\nContinue to process decidua parietalis, decidua basalis and villous tissues separately.\nTissue washing and digestion\nTiming: 2.5 h\nThis step details how to wash and then digest the placental tissues.\nWash the tissues without centrifugation by adding sterile 1× PBS into each of the conical tubes,\nWait until the tissue settles in the lower half of the tube (for approximately 1 min)\nCarefully discard the supernatant by either pouring it out or using a serological pipette.\nFill up the tubes with PBS and wash all tissues several times until the PBS is clear and there is no blood visible.\nIf more than 20 mL of tissue was collected during dissection, split the tissue in 2 or more tubes while washing.\nCut the tissue into small pieces (1–2 mm2) inside the 50 mL conical tube using scissors.\nWash the tissues without centrifugation by adding sterile 1× PBS into each of the conical tubes until the PBS is clear as described in step 6.\nAfter the last wash step, let the tissue settle for 2 min to the bottom of the 50 mL conical tube until no debris are visible in the PBS supernatant, measure and write down tissue volume.",
    "Divide the tissue into 50 mL conical tubes to obtain 10 mL of tissue per tube. Fill up each tube with serum-free RPMI and centrifuge at 650 g for 1 min.\nCarefully discard the supernatant. Add serum free RPMI to obtain a total RPMI and tissue volume of 20 mL. Add 10 mL of the enzyme cocktail A (see materials and equipment) per tube.\nEnzyme cocktail A aliquots can be prepared and stored for up to 3 months at −20°C until ready to use.\nWrap the tubes with parafilm to ensure they are well sealed to prevent spillage and place the tubes horizontally in a shaking 37°C water bath at 50 rpm for 75–90 min.\nFiltration and density gradient centrifugation\nTiming: 3 h\nThis step details how to filter placental tissues after digestion and how to load suspensions on Percoll gradients for density gradient centrifugation.\nRemove the tubes from the water bath and remove the parafilm.\nFill up the tubes with wash medium B (see materials and equipment). Wash Medium B can be prepared ahead of time and stored for up to 1 week at 4°C until use.\nLet the tissue settle to the bottom of the tube for approximately 1 min\nFilter the supernatant through a metal dissociation sieve placed in a 15 cm petri dish.\nGently stir the solution through the sieve with the back of a transfer pipette to strain the supernatant into the petri dish.\nFill up the tube with wash medium B to resuspend the remaining tissue and repeat steps 13b-d once.\nTransfer the remaining tissue into the metal dissociation sieve,\nadd 10–30 mL wash medium B.\ngently stir the solution through the sieve with the back of a transfer pipette to strain the supernatant into the petri dish.\nDiscard the remaining tissue fragments.",
    "Critical: When stirring the tissue and liquid in the strainer do not attempt to grind the remaining tissue through the filter as this will result in impurities.\nFilter the supernatants from the petri dish progressively through 100 μm, 70 μm and then 40 μm cell strainers into 50 mL conical tubes.\nCentrifuge filtered supernatants at 650 g for 7 min, discard the supernatant and gently resuspend the cell pellet by pipetting up and down with a sterile bulb pipette.\nAdd wash medium A in a volume equal to the tissue volume measured in step 9.\nAdd a 1:1 volume of Percoll 50% solution (see Materials and equipment) to the cell suspension to achieve a final Percoll concentration of 25%.\nAll Percoll solutions can be prepared ahead of time and stored for up to 1 week at 4°C until ready to use.\nLayer the Percoll gradients in 50 mL conical tubes using 10 mL of 70% Percoll, 15 mL of 45% Percoll, 20 mL of 25% Percoll containing the cells and 5 mL PBS as described in: Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and Methods Videos S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1], S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2], and S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2690-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Percoll gradient\n(A) The Percoll gradient is loaded by making layers of 10 mL 70% Percoll (1.082 g/mL), 15 mL 45% Percoll (1.053 g/mL), and 20 mL 25% Percoll (1.029 g/mL) with the isolated cell fractions in suspension and 5 mL PBS.\n(B) After density gradient centrifugation the lymphocyte enriched fraction is collected from the 1.082 / 1.053 g/mL interface and macrophage enriched fractions from the 1.053 / 1.029 g/mL interface.\n(C) The pellet and the proteins, fats and debris are discarded; (C) a photo of a Percoll gradient after density gradient centrifugation.",
    "Critical: Practice to make Percoll gradients with perfectly separated layers; fuzzy layers result in diminished cell yields. Use bulb transfer pipettes to carefully layer the different concentrations of Percoll on top of one another without mixing. Touching the tip of the pipette to the wall of the tube helps to control the loading (see attached Methods Videos S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1], S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2], and S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]). Loading Percoll gradients using 4°C Percoll solutions generates better results.\nGently load the tubes in a centrifuge and centrifuge the samples at 800 g for 30 min with no brake.\nOnce the centrifugation is complete, there will be three distinct cell fractions visible in each tube (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nUsing a sterile bulb pipette carefully collect the top layer containing debris and discard this fraction.\nUsing a sterile bulb pipette carefully collect the macrophage band at the 45%/25% interface and transfer it into a sterile conical tube.\nUsing a sterile bulb pipette carefully collect the lymphocyte band at the 70%/45% interface and transfer it into a sterile conical tube.\nFor both macrophage and lymphocyte fractions, transfer a maximum of 20 mL of cells into one 50 mL conical tube and fill up the tubes with wash medium A and centrifuge at 800 g for 7 min.\nCritical: With the transfer of cells, some Percoll from the gradient is transferred to the 50 mL conical tube. Not sufficiently diluting this Percoll with wash medium will result in excessive cell loss, as cells will not deposit properly. After centrifuging the cells, take care to notice if there are cells attached to the walls of the tube and make sure to collect them in the bottom of the tube while resuspending.\nCarefully decant your supernatant and resuspend cell pellets in 0.5–1 mL wash medium B. Count cells.",
    "Note: The cell pellet now contains the isolated and purified cells for immune-phenotyping or cell sorting by flow cytometry.\nFor cell sorting, bring cells up to a concentration of about 2 × 106 cell per mL add anti-CD45, CD14, CD56, CD8 and CD4 antibodies listed for 30 min on ice and in the dark.\nAdd 10 mL wash medium B and centrifuge cells at 800 g for 7 min. Discard supernatant and carefully resuspend cell pellets in 0.5–1 mL wash medium B.\nFilter cells through a 40 μm cell strainer and transfer to a 5 mL sterile FACS tube with cap.\nAdd a viability dye e.g., 7AAD prior to cell sorting and sort live CD45+CD14-CD56+ single dNK cells, CD45+CD14-CD56-CD4+ and CD45+CD14-CD56-CD8+ T cells according to the gating strategy depicted in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2690-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Gating strategy for cell sorting\nGating strategy of a representative term placenta decidua parietalis lymphocyte sample is shown. First, leukocytes are selected by gate R1 in the FSC-A / SSC-A plot. Second, doublets are excluded by gate R2 in the FSC-A / FSC-H plot and R3 in the SSC-A / SSC-H plot. CD45 and 7AAD are plotted and CD45+7AAD- live cells are selected by R4. Next CD45 and CD14 are plotted to select CD45+CD14+ macrophages and CD45+CD14- lymphocytes (R5). Lymphocytes (R5) are then plotted for CD45 and CD56 to select CD45+CD56+ dNK (sort gate I) and CD45+CD56- lymphocytes (R6). (F) CD45+CD56- lymphocytes (R6) are then plotted for CD4 and CD8 to select CD45+CD56-CD4+ and CD45+CD56-CD8+ T cells (sort gates II and III). CD3 and TCR staining are not used during live cell sorting to avoid T cell activation. Decidual macrophages can be sorted from the decidual macrophage preparation using R1 + R2 + R3 + R4 and then selecting CD45+CD14+ cells.",
    "After cell sorting, centrifuge all cell fractions at 650 g for 7 min, discard supernatant and resuspend purified lymphocytes at 1 × 106 cells per mL in cell culture medium A. For dNK cells add 2.5 ng/mL IL-15 and for T cells add 50 Units IL-2.\nUpon FACS sort, purified leukocyte fractions were submitted to the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Centre (CCHMC) cytology core to determine maternal (XX) and male fetal (XY) cells (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2690-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Freeze Medium A should be made fresh on the day of use.\nTransfer cells to sterile 1.2 mL cryo tube.\nSlow freeze cells in cool cell at −80°C\nAfter 2 days transfer vials to liquid nitrogen for long term storage.",
    "Note: freezing and thawing decidual lymphocyte fractions may result in the loss of over 50%–80% of viable cells. Particularly, freezing <2 × 106 decidual lymphocyte will result in high cell loss.\nCo-culture of placental lymphocytes with sample matched fetal HLA-G+ EVT\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step details how to set up co-cultures of placental lymphocyte fractions with sample matched fetal primary HLA-G+ EVT2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3],6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6].\nIsolate primary HLA-G+ EVT from the same placenta or use established HLA-G+ EVT-like cell lines according to the protocols described by Hamilton et al. 20237[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7].\nSeed 5 × 104 HLA-G+ EVT in 100 μL Cell Culture Medium B on a collagen or fibronectin coated flat bottom 48 well culture plate.\nAdd 1 × 105 purified decidual or peripheral blood NK cells, T cells or macrophages in 100 μL cell culture medium A to the HLA-G+ EVT. Cell culture medium A and B should always be mixed 1:1 to maintain EVT and leukocyte viability.\nFor negative controls include additional wells only containing HLA-G+ EVT or leukocyte fractions.\nFor positive controls include additional wells with 1 μg/mL PMA and 1 μg/mL Ionomycin (NK cells and T cells; 1 μg/mL anti-CD3/CD28 beads (T cells) or 100 ng/mL LPS (macrophages).\nDetermination of Treg induction by HLA-G+ EVT using flow cytometry\nTiming: 4 day incubation and 5–6 h processing\nThis step details how to determine Treg induction by HLA-G+ EVT using Flow cytometry of CD4+ T cells and EVT co-cultures.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]\nAfter a 4-day (96 h) co-culture of HLA-G+ EVT and T cells, harvest T cells using a p200 pipette and transfer cells to a 5 mL FACS tube. Rinse the wells twice with 200 μL cell culture medium A to make sure all T cells are collected.\nSpin once at 7 min at 800 g and put on ice.",
    "Add antibodies for Treg cell surface antigens including but not limited to CD45, CD4, CD45RA, CD25, PD1 and TIGIT. Incubate 30 min on ice.\nWash cells with 2 mL cell culture medium A and spin once at 7 min at 800 g.\nUse the ebiosciences FOXP3 fix and perm kit according to manufacturer instructions and add antibodies for intracellular detection of FOXP3 and HELIOS. Incubate 20 min on ice.\nWash cells with 2 mL cell culture medium A and spin once at 7 min at 800 g.\nAdd 0.2 mL cell culture medium A and acquire cells on 8+ parameter flow cytometer.\nAnalyze cells according to strategy depicted in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2690-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Co-culture with HLA-G+ EVT increased the frequency of FOXP3+ and PD1+ cells as well as the Mean Fluorescence Intensity of FOXP3. A representative example of HLA-G+EVT from term placenta decidua basalis is shown.\nCytokine secretion in response to HLA-G+ EVT\nTiming: 4–24 h incubation and 1 h processing\nThis step details how to determine cytokine secretion by decidual immune cells in response to HLA-G+ EVT.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3],8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]\nTo detect cytokine secretion of placental NK cells, T cells and macrophages in response to HLA-G+ EVT, set up co-cultures as described in step 35–39.\nIncubate co-cultures for 4–24 h in an incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nCollect 150 μL supernatant in a non-stick 0.7 mL tube and spin once at 800 g for 7 min to remove cell debris.\nTransfer two times 70 μL supernatant to clean non-stick 0.7 mL tubes and freeze directly in −80°C until use.",
    "Analyze supernatants by ELISA or multiplex assay.\nDegranulation and intracellular cytokine responses to HLA-G+ EVT\nTiming: 4–16 h incubation and 1 h processing\nThis step details how to determine degranulation and intracellular cytokines responses of decidual immune cells in response to HLA-G+ EVT.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4],8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]\nTo detect degranulation and cytokine production of NK and T cells in response to EVT, to each co-culture described in 35–37, add CD107a PerCP/Cy5.5 or IgG2a PerCP/Cy5.5 control antibodies at a final concentration of 250 ng/mL.\nIncubate co-cultures for 4–16 h in an incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nAdd monensin for the last 4–6 h of the co-culture to detect intracellular cytokines.\nUsing a p200 pipette transfer lymphocytes to a 5 mL FACS tube. Rinse the wells twice with 200 μL cell culture medium A to make sure all lymphocytes are collected.\nSpin once at 7 min at 800 g and put on ice.\nAdd antibodies for lymphocyte cell surface antigens including but not limited to CD45, CD4, CD8, CD45RA, CD56 and KIR2DL1.
