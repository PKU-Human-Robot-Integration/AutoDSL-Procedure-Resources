(A–D) Working in a 10 cm dish containing ice-cold HBSS, freshly harvested eyes are cleaned of connective tissue, bisected, and the lens, retina, iris, and ciliary body are removed. (E) Using curved Vannas scissors, the cornea is removed immediately anterior to the limbus. (F) A second cut is then made posterior to the ciliary body to isolate the corneal rim/iridocorneal angle/limbal region. (G–H) Isolated corneal rim/iridocorneal angle/limbal region samples are immediately transferred to ice-cold dye-free DMEM and minced using fine scissors. (I) Minced tissue is transferred to a microcentrifuge tube for subsequent dissociation.Dissection of iridocorneal angle region Once begun, dissection should be performed as quickly as practical to limit cell mortalities. In our experience, the full dissection procedure takes a practiced surgeon about 5 min per eye, with a few minutes added if the same person is performing both euthanasia/enucleation and microdissection.Sacrifice mice according to the protocol approved by your local animal care and use committee. In our laboratory, mice are first anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine cocktail followed by cervical dislocation for euthanasia.Immediately after euthanasia, enucleate eye globes by cutting on the lateral side of the eye socket using scissors to cut through the conjunctiva and surrounding tissue. Take care not to puncture the eye at this stage. After making this incision, enucleate the eye by pulling back the tissue surrounding the eye socket and firmly grasping the optic nerve with forceps. The eye can then be cleanly pulled away and placed in ice-cold HBSS.To dissect the iridocorneal angle/limbal region, first use straight scissors to cleanly trim as much conjunctival and connective tissue from globe as possible (Figure 1A). Take care not to puncture the globe itself, as deflation of the eye can make this process more difficult.",
    "Next, cut the globe in half in either the sagittal or transverse direction so that the limbus and ciliary body bisect each section (Figure 1B–1C). Remove the lens and discard. Remove the retina using forceps and then, using curved Vannas scissors, carefully trim away the iris and ciliary body (Figure 1D). Take care not to damage the angle region, and err on the side of leaving some ciliary body or iris tissue. Next, while grasping the sclera near the hole left by the optic nerve, use the curved scissors to remove the cornea, cutting as close to the limbus as possible without damaging the angle region (Figure 1D–1E). Remove the cornea, and then make a second smooth cut immediately below the root of the ciliary body to free the limbal/iridocorneal angle region (Figure 1E–1F). Working in albino mice, this piece of tissue will look similar to a soft fingernail clipping. Immediately transfer this tissue to a 20 mm cell culture dish containing ice-cold DMEM with 10% FBS and continue isolating the limbal regions from the other half of the eye and the opposite globe. After dissection, you will have 4 slivers of limbal/iridocorneal angle tissue from each mouse.The tissues are then minced before digestion. Working submerged in the small dish of ice-cold DMEM + 10% FBS to prevent small tissue fragments from sticking to pipet tips, grasp each sliver of tissue by one end and, working from the other end with the fine scissors, reduce the tissue to fine slices by making a series of cuts perpendicular to the length of the tissue (Figure 1G–1I). Repeat until all tissues have been minced into the ice-cold media and proceed immediately with tissue digestion.",
    "Tissue dissociation Using a 1 mL pipet equipped with a wide bore tip, collect the minced tissues and transfer them into 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes for tissue dissociation (Figure 2). If necessary, allow tissues to settle (1–3 min), or centrifuge 350 × g for 30 s and remove supernatant to make space for additional volume until all tissue is collected.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4426/bioprotoc-12-10-4426-g002.jpgFigure 2. Flow chart showing an overview of the dissociation procedure. Allow samples to settle on ice or centrifuge 350 × g for 30 s before carefully aspirating media without disturbing tissues.Add 1 mL of pre-warmed digestion mix (see Recipes) containing 10% FBS, 1 mg/mL Collagenase A and 1 μM of Y27362. Rotate gently to mix and then place on a pre-warmed 37°C hot block shaking at 450 rpm.Incubate tissues for 2 h. At 30 min intervals, gently mix by inverting the tube 3–4 times to ensure tissue remains in suspension.After 2 h incubation, collect tissue fragments and dissociated cells by centrifugation at 350 × g for 5 min at 20°C. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend gently in 1 mL of DPBS to wash.  Repeat centrifugation step, and then resuspend tissues in 1mL of pre-warmed 0.25% Trypsin EDTA containing 100 units of RNAse free DNase 1.Return samples to shaking 37°C block for 10 min.After 10 min, triturate samples using a 1 mL pipet equipped with a wide bore tip. Gently resuspend tissues by slowly aspirating 1 mL and returning it to the tube. Make 10 strokes, taking care not to introduce bubbles or damage cells by aggressive mixing.Return to 37°C block for an additional 10 min, then use a normal bore P1000 tip to make 10 additional mixing strokes. Incubate for 5 additional mins and then mix using 10 additional strokes with the standard bore tip.",
    "On the final stroke, transfer the cell suspension from the 2 mL to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.Collect dissociated cells by centrifugation at 350 × g for 5 min at 20°C. Gently aspirate supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in 1 mL of DMEM + 10% FBS to neutralize the Trypsin EDTA.Gently aspirate the full sample using a 1 mL pipet equipped with a standard bore P1000 tip, place a Flowmi micro 40 μm filter over the aperture of the pipet tip and slowly filter the cells into a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube to remove debris. Take care not to damage the cells by subjecting them to high pressure during filtration.Repeat centrifugation step and resuspend in 1 mL of HBSS containing 1% BSA.Repeat centrifugation step and aspirate supernatant. Gently resuspend cells in 200 μL (see Notes) of additional HBSS containing 1% BSA.Filter cells through an additional 40 μm Flowmi filter, transferring to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.Place cells on ice and use immediately for downstream applications."
