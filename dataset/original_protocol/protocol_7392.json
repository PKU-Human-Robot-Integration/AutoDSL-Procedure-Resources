    "Cell culture Warm DMEM supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS and 1% (vol/vol) penicillin and streptomycin solution (hereafter referred to as complete DMEM) and 1× PBS in a 37°C water bath for at least 15 min.Wash ~90% confluent human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293T) in a T25 flask with 3 mL of 1× PBS, aspirate the PBS, and add 0.5 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA.Incubate the cells at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 3–5 min, add 3 mL of prewarmed complete DMEM, and transfer the cell suspensions to a 15 mL sterile conical tube.Spin down the cells at 300 × g for 3 min at room temperature, discard the supernatant, and resuspend the cell pellet in 15 mL of complete DMEM.Dispense 4 mL of the cell suspension into a T25 flask and incubate it for three days at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 before subculturing again.Cell transfection The 293T cell suspension should be prepared (as described in the Cell culture procedure) the day before transfection (Day 1) (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4600/bioprotoc-13-03-4600-g001.jpgFigure 1. Schematic diagram of the schedule for cell transfection and SEAP analysis Count the cells using a hemocytometer and seed 6 × 104 HEK-293T cells per well in a 24-well cell culture plate; culture for 18 h.The next day (Day 2), prepare the transfection mix as follows:Add 500 ng of the corresponding plasmid (see Table 1) into 50 μL of FBS-free and antibiotic-free DMEM medium for each well of a 24-well plate.Add 1.5 μL of PEI (1 μg/μL, PEI and DNA at a ratio of 3:1) into the above plasmid DNA solution.To scale up, multiply the quantities by the number of replicates.Vortex vigorously for 30 s.Incubate the DNA-PEI mixture solution at room temperature for 15 min.Add 50 μL of transfection mix dropwise to each well.",
    "Rock the slide gently a few times and incubate at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.Six hours after transfection, change the medium with fresh complete DMEM and incubate the 24-well plate at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator until Day 3.On Day 3, the transfected slides can be used to perform SEAP reporter assay.SEAP reporter assay Aspirate 200 μL of cell culture supernatant from each sample and transfer into a chamber of a 96-well plate.Heat-inactivate the cell culture supernatants at 65°C for 30 min.Prewarm 2× SEAP assay buffer (see Recipes) at 37°C and protect from light.Mix 100 μL of 2× SEAP buffer with 20 μL of substrate solution (see Recipes) in the dark.Add 120 μL of the above-mentioned mixed substrate solution into 80 μL of heat-inactivated cell culture supernatant. At least three replicates should be performed for each group. The media will change color from pink to orange in the presence of SEAP (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4600/bioprotoc-13-03-4600-g002.jpgFigure 2. Detection of SEAP production at the indicated time points after illumination. In the presence of SEAP, the media changes from pink to orange. The yellow color intensity correlates with light illumination time.Measure light absorbance at 405 nm at 37°C for 15 min using a multi-mode microplate reader. See Figure 3 for the detailed procedure.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4600/bioprotoc-13-03-4600-g003.jpgFigure 3. Schematic diagram of SEAP reporter assay Calculate the levels of SEAP activity using data points that yield a rate of change in light absorbance that is linear with respect to time. (If available, a computer-linked kinetic ELISA plate reader is most convenient, as this will precisely calculate the linear change in A405 in all 96 wells of a microplate over time.)"
