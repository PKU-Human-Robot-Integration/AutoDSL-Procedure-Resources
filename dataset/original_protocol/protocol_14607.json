    "Animal experiments were authorized by the Animal Center for Biomedical Experimentation at Gyeongsang National University.\n1. Preparations for the Animal Procedure\nPrepare the adult female minipigs for the non-invasive collection of MSCs from bone marrow and synovial fluid. Perform the clinical examination of the minipigs one day prior to anesthesia and sample collection.\n\t\nProvide clinically normal animals for physical examinations, which include body temperature, respiratory rate, and heart rate, and for the observation of the pigs' behavior and hematological statuses, using complete blood count tests.\n\t\tNote: Parameter intervals for clinically healthy minipigs are 11 - 29/min for the respiration rate, 68 - 98/min for the heart rate, and 37 - 38 °C for the body temperature.\nRemove all edible bedding from the cage during the preoperative fasting period of 6 - 12 hr prior to the administration of anesthesia for young and adult minipigs, 3 hr of fasting should be observed for the neonates. Provide drinking water until the time of anesthesia.\n2. Preparation of the Animals for Anesthesia\nMedicate the minipigs before the administration of anesthesia with acepromazine (0.1 mg/kg), medetomidine (0.03 mg/kg), and atropine (0.04 mg/kg).\n\t\nInject all medications intramuscularly (IM) using a 21 G needle with a length of at least 30 mm for adult minipigs. Perform the IM injection 1-3 cm behind the ear into the lateral cervical muscle or into the thigh muscle.\n\t\tNote: Perform all the procedures without eliciting fear or stress in the animals or requiring rough handling to safely inject the premedication.\nPlace the minipigs in a dorsal-recumbent position.\nFifteen minutes after the administration of the premedication, initiate anesthesia using 1.5% isoflurane administered through inhalation.\n\t\nContinue the inhalation of isoflurane (1.5%) through an endotracheal tube, followed by an increase in concentration to 2.5%, with oxygen (1.5 L/min) as the carrier gas.",
    "Continuously monitor the heart rate, body temperature, and percutaneous blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) of the minipigs during anesthesia. Use a circulating water blanket at a temperature of 38 - 39 °C to maintain body temperature. Apply an ophthalmologic ointment to protect the eyes from drying out during anesthesia.\nFollow Guedel's classification to assess the depth of anesthesia13.\n3. Preparations for Cell Isolation and Cultivation\nTo cultivate the MSCs derived from bone marrow and synovial fluid, prepare 500 ml of advanced Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (ADMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% Glutamax, 10 ng/ml of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and 1.0% penicillin-streptomycin (10,000 IU and 10,000 µg/ml, respectively, Pen-Strep).\n\t\nIncubate the ADMEM at 38.5 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 within a CO2 incubator.\nPrepare 500 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate buffer saline (DPBS) according to the manufacturer's instructions for cell isolation and washing.\n4. Collecting Bone Marrow from the Minipigs\nSelect an area approximately 15 x 15 cm in size on the iliac crest (Figure 1), and remove the hair from this area using sterilized safety razors or electric clippers. Once the minipig is positioned, alternately scrub the procedure site three times with the following sterilization agents: povidone iodine and 70% ethanol. After the area is thoroughly dry, apply sterile drapes.\nPre-coat the 10 ml syringe with 100 U/ml of heparin by rinsing it with 3 - 4 ml of heparin before ejecting the anti-coagulating agent.\n\tNote: Perform this step to avoid coagulation in the syringe during bone marrow aspiration.\nExtract a minimum of 5 ml of bone marrow from the iliac crest bone of the minipig under anesthesia, using a bone marrow extractor (3.0 × 100 mm) tightly attached to the heparin pre-coated 10 ml syringe.",
    "5. Isolation of Cells Extracted from the Bone Marrow and In Vitro Cultivation\nIsolate the cells from the extracted bone marrow.\n\t\nDilute the extracted bone marrow with an equal volume of DPBS in a 15 ml conical tube at room temperature.\nAdd 3 ml of density centrifugation media (Ficoll-Paque) to the 15 ml conical tube.\nDilute a 4 ml layer of the bone marrow with DPBS, which is placed on the density centrifugation media without mixing, and centrifuge it at 400 × g for 40 min at room temperature.\nHarvest the layer of mononuclear cells (MNCs) from the buffy coat between the two layers containing the plasma (top layer) and the density centrifugation media (bottom layer), and transfer the MNCs into a 15 ml conical tube.\nDilute the transferred MNCs with 7 - 8 ml of DPBS and centrifuge them at 500 × g for 10 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant and wash the cells twice with DPBS.\nSuspend the cell pellet in 2 ml of ADMEM and transfer it to a 35 mm tissue culture dish. Incubate the culture dish at 38.5 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.\nIn vitro cultivation of cells isolated from bone marrow.\n\t\nAfter 48 hr, aspirate the medium with the cells that have not attached to the dish, and replace 2 ml of the ADMEM and incubate it at 38.5 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Change the medium every third days.\nAt 70 - 80% confluency, wash the cells with DPBS, dissociate them with 1 ml of 0.25% trypsin/EDTA, and incubate them at 37 °C for 3 - 5 min until the cells detach.",
    "Harvest the cells using 10 ml of ADMEM, transfer them into a 15 ml conical tube, and centrifuge them at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant.\nSuspend the harvested cells in 1 ml of fresh ADMEM and count them using a hemocytometer.\nPlace the cells in a 5 - 7.5 x 105/25T flask containing 4 ml of ADMEM and incubate them at 38.5 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Change the medium every third day.\n6. Collection of Synovial Fluid from the Minipigs\nSimilar to the procedure for bone marrow aspiration, select an appropriate area of approximately 15 x 10 cm (length/width) over the femoral joint, and remove the hair using sterilized safety razors or electric clippers, follow by sanitization procedures (step 4.1).\nInsert a 3 ml syringe with a 23 G needle into the joint after the palpation landmarks (patella and tibia crest).\n\t\nApply gentle suction to the syringes for the aspiration of synovial fluid in the joint. The approximate volume of synovial fluid collected from a joint is 0.5 - 1 ml, but this varies according to the size of the minipig or the joint. Flush through DPBS in the synovial cavity if the collected volume of synovial fluid is too small.\nImmediately withdraw the syringe to avoid contamination with blood.\n7. Cell Isolation from the Collected Synovial Fluid and In Vitro Cultivation\nIsolate the cells from the aspirated synovial fluid.\n\t\nDilute the aspirated synovial fluid with an equal volume of DPBS in a 15 ml conical tube at room temperature.\nTo remove debris, filter the diluted synovial fluid using a 40 µm nylon cell strainer.",
    "Add 10 ml of DPBS to the tube containing the filtered synovial fluid and centrifuge it at 400 × g for 10 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant and wash the cells twice with DPBS.\nSuspend the cell pellet in 2 ml of ADMEM, place the cells on a 2 - 3 x 105 cells/35 mm tissue culture dish with 2 ml of ADMEM, and incubate them at 38.5 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.\nRepeat step 5.2 for the in vitro cultivation of isolated synovial fluid-derived MSCs.\n8. Post-procedure Care of the Minipigs\nIf needed, close the skin at the bone marrow extractor injection site with a single suture using a skin stapler, after the bone marrow collection.\nAfter the procedure is completed, administer an intramuscular injection of enrofloxacin (5 mg/kg) and meloxicam (0.2 mg/kg) to the minipigs once a day for 3 days.\nAfter the procedure is completed, disinfect the bone marrow and synovial fluid collection site with 0.1% povidone iodine once a day for 3 days. Carefully observe daily to monitor for signs of complications (e.g., swelling, pus, or redness).\n9. Cell Phenotyping Using Flow Cytometry\nWhen the MSCs are 70 - 80% confluent at passages 3 - 5, wash the cells with DPBS and treat them with 1 ml of 0.25% (v/v) Trypsin/EDTA. Then, incubate them at 37 °C for 3 - 5 min until the cells are detached.\nHarvest the cells using 10 ml of DPBS, transfer them into a 15 ml conical tube, and centrifuge them at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant solution.\nTo fix the cells, suspend the cell pellet in 10 ml of a 3.7% formaldehyde solution and keep them at 4 °C for one day before the analysis.",
    "One day after fixing, wash the cells with DPBS twice using centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min each time. Discard the supernatant solution.\nSuspend the cell pellet in 4 ml of DPBS, which is supplemented with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA), and incubate the pellet for 1 hr at 4 °C to block non-specific Fc-mediated interactions.\nDistribute 500 µl aliquots of the cell suspension into 1.5 ml tubes.\nFor non-conjugated antibodies (CD29 and Vimentin), wash the cells by centrifugation at 300 × g for 3 min. Discard the supernatant solution.\nSuspend the cell pellet in 500 µl of a 1:100 dilution of the primary antibody and incubate it for 1 hr at 4 °C.\nWash the cells twice with 1% bovine serum albumin by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min each time. Discard the supernatant solution.\nSuspend the cell pellet in 500 µl of a 1:100 dilution of the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated secondary antibody and incubate it for 1 hr in the dark at 4 °C.\nFor the FITC-conjugated antibodies (Isotype, CD34, CD44 and CD45), wash the cells by centrifugation at 300 × g for 3 min. Discard the supernatant solution.\n\t\nSuspend the cell pellet in 500 µl of the 1:100 FITC-conjugated antibody and incubate it for 1 hr in the dark at 4 °C.\nFor both staining conditions, wash the cells twice with DPBS by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min each time. Discard the supernatant solution.\nSuspend the cells in 500 µl of DPBS, transfer them into a 5 ml round-bottom tube, and analyze the results using a flow cytometer8.\nSubscription Required.
