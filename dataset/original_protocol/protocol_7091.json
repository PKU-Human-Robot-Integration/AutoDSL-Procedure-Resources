    "Bacterial cell transformationThaw BL21 (AI) competent cells on ice.Under sterile conditions, add 100 ng of plasmid to 50 µL of competent cells, and place on ice for 12-15 min.Transfer the cells to a thermoblock (heat shock) at 37°C for 3 min, or at 42°C for 1.5 min.Transfer the cells back to ice for 2 min.Add 100 µL of 1× LB to the cells, place at 37°C for 10 min, and plate all the cells on a LB Agar plate containing 0.1 mg/mL Ampicillin.Incubate the plate at 37°C overnight.Culture growthPrimary cultureInoculate a swab (~15-20 colonies) of the transformed cells into 40 mL of 1× LB containing 0.1 mg/mL Ampicillin, and grow at 37°C in a shaker incubator (180 RPM) for 5-6 h.Secondary cultureInoculate 1% of primary culture in 1 L of 1× LB containing 0.1 mg/mL Ampicillin, grow at 37°C in a shaker incubator (180 RPM), and monitor the optical density (OD) of the secondary culture.Once the OD reaches 0.4-0.5, change the temperature of the shaker incubator (180 RPM) to 16°C.Once the OD at 600 nm reaches 0.6, induce the culture with 0.2% (w/v) Arabinose, and grow overnight (12-14 h) at 16°C.Cell pelleting, lysis, and lysate clarificationCell pelletingPellet the cells down using a Avanti J26X-SP centrifuge at an RCF of 5180 (~4,000-5,000 RPM) for 20 min, maintaining the temperature at 4°C, and then discard the supernatant.Either store the pellet at -80°C after plunge freezing in liquid nitrogen, or process it immediately for lysis.Bacterial cell lysisWeigh the cell pellet and resuspend it in lysis buffer (volume of the lysis buffer to be added is 5 times the weight of the cell pellet, i.e., 5 mL of lysis buffer for every 1 g of cell pellet).",
    "Lyse the cells on ice using a sonicator set at 60% amplitude, with a pulse of 1 s and a recovery of 3 s, for 3 min. Post this, allow the lysate to sit on ice for 5 min. Then, continue the sonication protocol for another 2 min.Lysate clarificationCentrifuge the lysate using an Optima-L-100K ultracentrifuge for 50 min at 100,000 × g, maintaining the temperature at 4°C.Transfer the lysate to a pre-chilled tube or conical flask, for loading onto the Ni-NTA column.Ni-NTA column chromatography (perform at 4°C, using a GE AKTAprime plus FPLC system)Equilibrate a GE HisTrapTM HP 5 mL Ni-NTA column with 3 column volumes (CV) of Buffer A.Load the supernatant onto the columns at a slow flow rate ~1 mL/min.After the supernatant is loaded, wash the column with 20 CV Buffer A at a flow rate of 2 mL/min.Elute the sample using a step gradient (5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 50%, and 100%) of Buffer B. Gradients of Buffer B were made by mixing of Buffer A and Buffer B. Elute two fractions of 5 mL each at each step.Load alternate fractions on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel with an appropriate protein ladder (Bio-Rad Precision Plus ProteinTM Standards) (Figure 2). The protein usually elutes in the step gradients of 5% to 30% of Buffer B. Subsequently, based on the SDS-PAGE gel, pool the fractions with most protein, which are usually fractions corresponding to 10%, 20%, and 30% of Buffer B (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4275/bioprotoc-12-01-4275-g002.jpgFigure 2. Representative 10% SDS-PAGE after Ni-NTA chromatography. Load 10 µL of sample (5 µL of the protein fraction mixed with 5 µL of 2× Laemmli sample buffer) on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The fractions with the most protein are pooled and dialysed. The SDS-PAGE gel is stained with Coomassie R-250.",
    "Dialysis (perform at 4°C, using SnakeSkinTM dialysis tubing 10000 MWCO)Dialyse the pooled fractions to remove excess salt and imidazole, using a 10,000 MWCO dialysis tubing against 2 L of Buffer B0 for 3 h.Anion exchange chromatography (perform at 4°C, using a Bio-Rad NGCTM chromatography system)Equilibrate a GE MonoQTM 10/100 GL column with 3 CV of Buffer B50.Using a 50 mL GE SuperloopTM, load the dialysed sample onto the column, and wash the column with 10 CV of Buffer B50.Elute the sample in 1 mL fractions, using a linear gradient (0-50%) of Buffer B1000 across 20 CV. Monitor the absorbance at 280 nM (UV280) and conductivity measurements. The protein begins to elute when the conductivity reaches ~38 mS/cm (Figure 3A).Based on the chromatograph, load alternate fractions of the protein peak on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel with an appropriate protein ladder (Bio-Rad Precision Plus ProteinTM Standards) (Figure 3B). Once the presence of the protein is confirmed, pool the fractions.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4275/bioprotoc-12-01-4275-g003.jpgFigure 3. Representative chromatogram and 10% SDS-PAGE after anion exchange chromatography. A. Elution profile of SauUSI after anion exchange chromatography using MonoQTM 10/100 GL column. The protein begins to elute as the conductivity approaches ~38 mS/cm. B. Representative 10% SDS-PAGE (stained with Coomassie R-250) image after anion exchange chromatography. 10 µL of sample (5 µL of the protein fraction mixed with 5 µL of 2× Laemmli sample buffer) is loaded on the gel. The fractions with the most protein are pooled and concentrated, using Vivaspin Turbo 10,000 MWCO centrifugal concentrator.Concentration of pooled fractions (perform at 4°C, using a Vivaspin Turbo 10,000 MWCO centrifugal concentrator)Equilibrate the centrifugal concentrator using Buffer B100.Add the pooled fractions into the concentrator, and spin at a RCF of 3180 (~4,000-5,000 RPM) until the sample is concentrated to ~600 µL, which takes approximately 1 h.",
    "Size exclusion chromatography (perform at 4°C, using a Bio-Rad NGCTM chromatography system)Equilibrate a GE Superdex 200TM 16/600 pg column with 1.5 CV of Buffer B100.Load the concentrated protein using a 1 mL loop onto the column.Elute the sample in 1 mL fractions across 1 CV of Buffer B100. This elution position represents a molecular weight of ~200 kDa, which is in accordance with the dimeric state of SauUSI (~219 kDa) (Figure 4A).Load the relevant fractions on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel with an appropriate protein ladder (Bio-Rad Precision Plus ProteinTM Standards) (Figure 4B). Once the presence of the protein is confirmed, pool the fractions (since the sample is denatured prior to loading onto a SDS-PAGE, the protein would run at the monomeric molecular weight of ~109 kDa).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4275/bioprotoc-12-01-4275-g004.jpgFigure 4. Representative chromatogram and 10% SDS-PAGE after size exclusion chromatography. A. Elution profile of SauUSI after anion exchange chromatography using Superdex 200TM 16/600 GL column. The protein begins to elute at ~0.45 CV. B. Representative 10% SDS-PAGE (stained with Coomassie R-250) image after size exclusion chromatography. 10 µL of sample (5 µL of the protein fraction mixed with 5 µL of 2× Laemmli sample buffer) is loaded on the gel. Size exclusion chromatography helps to separate the protein of interest from other contaminating proteins based on molecular weight, eventually leading to ≥95% purity of protein, and also to elute the protein in an appropriate buffer for further experiments. The fractions with protein are pooled and concentrated using a Vivaspin Turbo 10,000 MWCO centrifugal concentrator.Concentration of pooled fractions (perform at 4°C, using a Vivaspin Turbo 10,000 MWCO centrifugal concentrator)Equilibrate the centrifugal concentrator using Buffer B100, add the pooled fractions into the concentrator, and spin at 3,180 RCF (~4,000-5,000 RPM).",
    "Divide the concentrated protein (~10 mg/mL) into suitable aliquots (~5 µL), plunge freeze in liquid nitrogen, and store at -80°C.Running of 10% SDS-PAGE (Using Bio-Rad SDS-PAGE apparatus)Add 5 µL of sample to 5 µL of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and heat at 99°C for 10 min.Load the samples onto a 10% SDS-PAGE immersed in a running tank containing 1× TGS running buffer. Allow the gel to run at a constant voltage of 200 V for 45 min.After the run, allow the gel to stain in Coomassie (R-250) staining solution with gentle heating, using a commercial microwave until the solution boils.Destain the gel in Coomassie destaining solution with gentle heating, using a commercial microwave until the solution boils."
