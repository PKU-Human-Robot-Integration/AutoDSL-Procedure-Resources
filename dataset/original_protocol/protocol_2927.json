Wash the plates with sterile M9. Pipet the M9 across the plate several times to loosen worms and eggs that are stuck in the bacteria.\nCollect the liquid in a sterile 15 mL conical centrifuge tube with cap. Let worms settle (approx 5 min) and remove most of the water carefully, so as not to disturb the loose worm pellet.\nFor preparing eggs from each strain, make the lysis solution by mixing 0.3 mL 5 M NaOH with 1.2 mL bleach and 3.5 mL H2O. Add the solution to the centrifuge tube with the worms.\nCritical: Make this solution fresh just before use!\nRock the tube gently back and forth for about 3–5 min.\nCheck periodically, at first you will see intact worms, eventually they will start to dissolve.\nWhen most of worms have dissolved, give the tube a good shake or vortex. This will dissolve the remaining corpses.\nCritical: Be sure not to leave the worms in the bleach solution any longer than necessary to dissolve the worms. If the eggs are exposed to bleach for too long they will die.",
    "Spin the tube in a desktop centrifuge for 1 min at 1,300 × g to pellet released eggs.\nAspirate the supernatant and leave about 0.1 mL solution in the tube. Add sterile M9 to 12 mL. Shake well or vortex for a few seconds.\nRepeat steps e and f.\nTransfer the precipitation with 5–10 mL sterile M9 to a clean petri dish.\nPlace the plate in a constant temperature incubator at 20°C. After about 16 h, the eggs of the worm could be incubated into L1 or L2.\nNote: The lysis time of nematodes should not exceed 5 min.\nNote: The lysate should be cleaned, or the eggs may not hatch.\nTransfer synchronous nematodes to NGM plates seeded with E. coli OP50 until they reach L4 stage, which takes 48 h at 20°C.\nNote: Avoid nematodes starvation by transferring them to fresh plates seeded with E. coli OP50.\nStreak fresh E. coli OP50 on a new LB agar plate on the same day of animal synchronization and incubate the plate at 37°C for 16 h.\nThe following day, inoculate 5 mL of liquid LB with a single colony from the E. coli OP50 streak plate, at 180 rpm, 37°C for 16–24 h.\nSeed the fresh 35 mm NGM plates with 250 μL of the fresh E. coli OP50 liquid culture with or without the potential anti-aging drug (2 μM Usnic acid; add the drug to the autoclaved NGM media to mix before pouring the media into the petri dish). Allow the plate with the fresh E. coli OP50 liquid dry on super clean workbench.\nAssess the lifespan after drug-treatment in C. elegans\nTiming: no less than 20 days\nIn this section, we describe how to determine the lifespan after drug treatment.",
    "Transfer 30 synchronized L4 animals to each of the fresh 35 mm NGM plates seeded with E. coli OP50 and with or without drug (2 μM Usnic acid) at 20°C.\nMeasure the time from day one to observe the growth of nematodes\nFor the first 10–14 days, transfer worms everyday and afterwards every second day.\nNote: Contamination should be avoided during the transfer of nematodes.\nMark nematodes that do not respond to mild stimuli as dead. Animals that climb down from plates or show unnatural deaths, especially due to internal hatching of animals are excluded from analysis. Refer to Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] for lifespan data.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2672-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Usnic acid treatment extended the lifespan in wild-type animals\nKaplan-Meier survival curves of N2 hermaphrodite worms exposed to 2 μM Usnic acid (p < 0.05; log-rank test).\nNote: Three plates are tested per assay and all experiments are performed three times independently.\nAssess the content of age pigment after drug-treatment in C. elegans\nTiming: 10 days\nIn this section, we describe how to determine the content of age pigment after drug treatment.\nSynchronize nematodes and treat for 10 days with or without drug (2 μM Usnic acid) starting at L4 larvae stage.\nNote: Avoid nematodes starvation by transferring them to fresh plates seeded with E. coli OP50 every two days.\nMount worms onto an agarose pad attached to a glass slide.\nTo mount, we use 2% agarose pads made by dissolving 2% agarose in water in a microwave.\nPlace 2-3 pieces of tape on two microscope slides and put anon-taped slide in the middle in parallel.\nPut 50 μL of the 2% agarose on the middle slide and immediately drop another slide on top perpendicularly, so that the top slide is buffered from hitting the bottom by the tape.",
    "Wait about a minute and remove the top slide, leaving the agarose pad attached to the bottom slide.\nTake images with Zeiss Imager M2 microscope. The microscope magnification is 10 (objective) ×10 (eyepiece). Excitation wave length is 400 nm and detection wave length is 570 nm. Refer to Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] for age pigment.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2672-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Usnic acid treatment decreased the content of age pigment in C. elegans\nNematodes were synchronized and treated for 10 days with or without 2 μM Usnic acid starting at L4 larvae stage. “Age pigment” is quantified by measuring lipofuscin fluorescence normalized to auto-fluorescence in 2 μM Usnic acid-treated worms versus the control (n ≥ 30). (∗∗P < 0.01, unpaired t-test). The microscope magnification is 10 (objective)×10 (eyepiece). Excitation wave length is 400 nm and detection wave length is 570 nm. Error bars represent mean ± SEM of 3 independent biological replicates. Scale bar: 50 μm.\nMeasure fluorescence intensity by Image J.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]\nNote: Worms number (n) ≥30. Refer to Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] for quantification of age pigment.\nInstall the Image J software, open the software, click File-Open, open a fluorescent image that needs to be processed.\nClick the interface image-type-8-bit to get a picture.\nFlip image: Edit-Invert.\nImage calibration: Click the interface Analyze-Calibrate, select Uncalibrated OD, click OK, and then close the next step. Adjust the threshold and select the appropriate area: click Image-Adjust-Threshold.\nQuantitative output parameters are set: Analytic-set measurements, (check Mean gray value and Limit to threshold). Options need to be set according to the experimental requirements.\nOutput data: Analyze-Measure to record intDen data. excel was used to record and sort out all intDen values, and the sorted data was input into the analysis software for significance analysis and mapping.\nNote: All experiments are performed three times independently.",
    "Note: The bright color (light blue) in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] represents age pigment, which can be quantified by measuring lipofuscin fluorescence in worm intestine.\nAssess the locomotory ability after drug-treatment in C. elegans\nTiming: 5 and 10 days\nIn this section, we describe how to determine the locomotory ability after drug treatment.\nSynchronize nematodes and treat with or without drug (2 μM Usnic acid) starting at L4 larvae stage.\nNote: Avoid nematodes starvation by transferring them to fresh plates seeded with E. coli OP50.\nOn days 5 and 10 of life from L4 stage, measure 20 individuals from the control and experimental plates for body bend rate in liquid.\nNote: We count every time when there is a head swing.\nPlace worms in 20 μL M9 buffer on a glass slide and film with a Zeiss Imager M2 microscope.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2672-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Usnic acid treatment increased the locomotory ability in C. elegans\nNematodes were synchronized and treated with or without 2 μM Usnic acid starting at L4 larvae stage. On days 5 and 10 of life, 20 individuals from the control and experimental plates were measured for body bend rate in liquid. Locomotion as determined by the number of body bends per min in drug-treated worms versus the control (n ≥ 20). (∗∗P <0.01, unpaired t-test). Error bars represent mean ± SEM of 3 independent biological replicates.\nNote: Worms number (n) ≥20. Refer to Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] for quantification of body bend rate.\nNote: Body bends are counted by reviewing each frame of the 60 s film.\nNote: All experiments are performed three times independently."
