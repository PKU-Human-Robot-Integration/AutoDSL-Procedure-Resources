    "1. Synchronization Tasks\nPreparation of Instruments:\n\t\nConnect a standard MIDI percussion instrument to the computer via a conventional MIDI interface.\n\t\tNOTE: Data acquisition is realized via a MIDI electronic percussion instrument. The device captures the exact timing of the finger taps during the motor synchronization tasks.\nOpen the dedicated software for stimulus presentation and response recording.\n\t\tNOTE: The synchronization task is implemented using standard software for the presentation of audio material and recording of data from a digital MIDI musical instrument (with 1 msec precision).\nSound Material and Procedure:\n\t\nFrom the software interface, select the pacing stimulus to be used in the synchronization task from among three choices (isochronous sequence, music, and amplitude-modulated noise obtained from the wave envelope of the musical stimulus).\n\t\tNOTE: The isochronous sequence is composed of 96 isochronously presented tones (duration = 30 msec). The musical stimulus is a computer-generated piano version of a fragment of the Radetzky March (Opus 228) by Johann Strauss that includes 96 beats (beat = quarter note). Excerpts of the three stimuli are provided as Additional Materials to this manuscript.\nSelect the appropriate tempo for the selected pacing stimulus (450, 600, or 750 msec Inter-onset-interval (IOI) / Inter-beat-interval (IBI)) as indicated in the software interface. Ensure that the stimuli are delivered at a comfortable volume level over the headphones.\nAsk the participant to sit in a quiet room in front of the computer monitor.\nAsk the participant to tap on the MIDI percussion instrument using the index finger of her or his dominant hand in synchrony with the tones of the isochronous sequence or with the musical beats for more complex stimuli (music or noise). Instruct the participant to tap as regularly as possible, without changing the tapping rate, while synchronizing with the pacing stimulus.",
    "Start the stimulus presentation and recording of taps.\nEnd recording of taps after presenting the last tone or musical beat.\nData Analysis:\n\tNOTE: Analyze the data from the synchronized tapping tasks using circular statistics38,39. This method is particularly well-suited for the analysis of synchronization data40,41; moreover, circular statistics are sensitive to individual differences in timing abilities and are therefore able to uncover cases of poor synchronization2,40. The analysis procedure outlined below is implemented using Matlab software (using the CircStat toolbox39).\n\t\nTransform the time of the taps relative to the pacing stimuli into angles on the unit circle (from 0-360°) following the procedure indicated by Berens39. 0° (which is equal to 360°) corresponds to the time of the occurrence of the pacing stimulus (i.e., the sounds or musical beats). Use the following formula to obtain the angle for each tap time: [angle(radians) = 2 × π × (time of the tap / IOI)]. Convert radians into degrees with the circ_rad2ang function39.\nPlot the angles obtained in the tapping trial as a distribution of dots on the unit circle. Do this using the circ_plot function39. Provide angles in radians as the argument for the function to display the plot (see example in Figure 1).\nFor each tapping trial, use the angles (dots on the circle) to compute the mean resultant vector R 38,39,42 (see Figure 1). Use the circ_mean39 and circ_r39 functions, which allow for the computation of synchronization accuracy and consistency, respectively.\nCompute the synchronization accuracy (i.e., on average, how far from the pacing stimulus the participant taps in a synchronized tapping trial), which corresponds to the angle θ of vector R. Use the circ_mean function39. Provide angles in radians as the argument for the function.",
    "Submit the tapping data to the Rayleigh test43 to assess whether the distribution of the dots around the circle is random, using the circ_rtest function39. Provide angles in radians as the argument for the function.\n\t\tNOTE: In the Rayleigh test, reject the null hypothesis (i.e., circular uniformity, randomly distributed dots around the circle) if the R vector length is large enough (e.g., greater than 0.4), indicating that participants tapped at a given phase relationship with respect to the pacing stimulus above chance. Only when Rayleigh test is significant (i.e., when the distribution of dots around the circle is not random) synchronization accuracy can be properly interpreted.\nCompute the synchronization consistency (i.e., the variability in the discrepancy between the time of the taps and the pacing stimuli), which corresponds to the length of the vector R (from 0 to 1). Use the circ_r function39. Provide angles in radians as the argument for the function.\n\t\tNOTE: The consistency is 1 when all of the taps occur at exactly the same time interval before or after the pacing stimuli; the consistency is 0 when the taps are randomly distributed around the circle.\nEvaluation of Individual Results:\n\tNOTE: Compare the performance of a participant to a normative group or to a control group to uncover cases of poor synchronization accuracy or poor consistency. To perform this comparison, run a corrected t-test44 implemented in the singlims computer program (http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/j.crawford/pages/dept/SingleCaseMethodsComputerPrograms.htm[href=http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/j.crawford/pages/dept/SingleCaseMethodsComputerPrograms.htm]).\n\t\nOpen the singlims computer program. Enter the mean and SD of the synchronization accuracy, and the sample size of the normative or control group. Provide the synchronization accuracy for the participant to be compared to the normative or control group. Click on the “Compute” button to obtain the results of the corrected t-test.",
    "NOTE: The participant performed significantly poorer than the normative or control group when the two-tailed probability of the corrected t-test is below 0.05.\nEnter the mean and SD of the synchronization consistency and sample size of the normative or control group. Provide the synchronization consistency for the participant who is to be compared to the normative or control group.\n2. Rhythm Perception Tasks (Anisochrony Detection)\nPreparation of Instruments:\n\t\nOpen the computer program used for implementing the anisochrony detection tasks. Ensure that the keys of the computer keyboard are properly set to record participants’ answers.\n\t\tNOTE: The rhythm perception tasks are implemented using standard software for running behavioral experiments (i.e., stimulus presentation and recording of behavioral responses).\nSound Material and Procedure:\n\t\nSelect the stimulus (either isochronous stimulus or music) as indicated by the software interface. Choose the appropriate tempo (450, 600, or 750 msec IOI/IBI) of the selected stimulus. Ensure that the stimuli are delivered over the headphones at a comfortable volume level.\n\t\tNOTE: Stimuli are based on the same auditory material used in the Synchronization tasks. Each stimulus includes only 8 isochronously presented tones or musical beats instead of 96. For each stimulus type, there is a “change” version (50% of the trials, n = 24) and a “no-change” version (50% of the trials, n = 24). In the change stimuli, the penultimate sound or musical beat occurs earlier or later than expected (by 8, 12, or 16% of the sequence IOI/IBI) based on the previous IOIs/IBIs. In the no-change stimulus, the IOIs/IBIs are completely isochronous.",
    "Instruct the participant to sit in a quiet room in front of the computer monitor, listen to the stimulus and then judge, after its presentation, whether a change in the interval between the stimuli or beats (i.e., anisochrony) is present or not. Encourage the participant to pay attention to the entire sequence.\nStart the stimulus presentation. Ask the participant to respond by pressing one of two keys on the computer keyboard (i.e., one key for “change” or the other key for “no-change” responses) after the presentation of the stimulus.\nData Analysis:\n\tNOTE: Analyze the data obtained from the rhythm perception task by calculating the discriminability index (d’) at each level of change (at 8, 12, 16% of the IOI/IBI) and for each IOI/IBI. The higher the d’ value, the greater the sensitivity to anisochronies.\n\t\nConsider the responses (n = 48) yielded by each participant for a given stimulus, recorded in the output file by the software used to run the behavioral experiment. Count the number of responses when the anisochrony present in the stimulus has been correctly detected. Compute the Hits rate (i.e., number of Hits / number of change stimuli).\nCount the number of responses when the participant reported a change in the interval between stimuli or beats when there was no change. Compute the False-Alarm (FA) rate (i.e., number of FAs/number of no-change stimuli).\nCalculate the z-score for the Hits rate and FA rate, using the norminv Matlab function (z-score = norminv(Hits rate or FA rate)). Subtract the z-score for the FA rate from the z-score for the Hits rate to obtain d’.\nEvaluation of Individual Results:",
    "NOTE: Compare the performance of a participant to a normative or control group to uncover cases of poor rhythm perception. Regarding the results of the synchronization tasks, perform a corrected t-test using the singlims computer program.\n\t\nOpen the singlims computer program. Enter the mean and SD of d’ and the sample size of the normative or control group. Provide the d’ value for the participant who is to be compared to the normative or control group.\n\t\tNOTE: The participant performed significantly poorer than the normative or control group when the two-tailed probability of the corrected t-test is below 0.05.\nSubscription Required.
