    "All of the procedures involving animal subjects were performed according to the NIH guidelines for the care and use of animals.\n1. Preparation of the Integrative Micro-Drive Array\nCreate a micro-drive array for cortical LFP recordings as described elsewhere1,2,3. Leave at least 6 metal holes open on an electrode interface board (EIB) for use as ECG/EMG/BR channels that are connected to bioflex wires as described in 1.2.\nCut a bioflex wire into 6 pieces with lengths of 5.0 cm. Peel off the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) coating of both ends of all the wire pieces with lengths of ~5.0 mm. Connect one end of each of the wire pieces to one of the open metallic holes (ECG/EMG/BR channels) on the EIB with a gold pin.\nCut an enamel wire into two 5.0-cm pieces. Solder one end of each of these wires to the ground/reference (g/r) channels on the EIB (Figure 3, see also previous papers12,13).\nFor the preparation of ECG electrodes, cut a bioflex wire into two 16-cm pieces. Peel off the PTFE coating of the ends of these wire pieces at lengths of ~5.0 mm on one end (short end) and ~15 mm on the other end (long end).\nForm a wire ring with a diameter of 2.0 mm by bending the long end of the wire, and fixing the shape of the ring by soldering.\nFor the preparation of EMG electrodes, cut a bioflex wire into 2 pieces with lengths of 8 cm. Peel off the PTFE coating from both ends of these wire pieces with lengths of ~5.0 mm.",
    "For the preparation of BR electrodes, cut a bioflex wire into 2 pieces with lengths of 6.0 cm. Peel off the enamel coating of both ends of these wire pieces with lengths of ~5.0 mm. Solder one end of each of these wire pieces to the head of a stainless- steel screw (stem diameter: 1.0 mm, stem length: 4.0 mm).\nFor the preparation of ground/reference (gr) electrodes, cut an enamel wire into 2 pieces with lengths of 6.0 cm. Peel off the enamel coating of both ends of these wire pieces with lengths of ~5.0 mm. Solder one end of each of these wire pieces to the head of a stainless- steel screw (stem diameter: 1.4 mm, stem length: 3.0 mm).\nGas sterilize all electrodes and stainless screws and keep these in a clean space.\n2. Implantation of the ECG/EMG Electrodes\nNOTE: Perform all surgical steps with aseptic technique using sterilized gloves and autoclaved instruments. For all steps involving the creation of an incision, sterilize the skin with 70% ethanol before, and cover the incision with surgical drapes.\nFix an anesthetized (1.0-3.0% isoflurane gas) rat on its back on a flat heat pad. Give buprenorphine as an analgesic. Place veterinary ointment on the rat's eyes to prevent dryness. Use betadine to clean the surface of the skin. \nMake an incision of ~2.0 cm in the medial chest area. Expose the intercostal muscles by separating the chest muscles. Suture the rings of the ECG electrodes to the intercostal muscles.\nFix the stomach of the animal on the heat pad. Make an incision of ~1.0 cm in the dorsal neck area.\nInsert the ECG electrodes subcutaneously through the chest incision. Slide the ends to the dorsal neck area, and pull them out from the neck incision. Suture the chest incision.",
    "Insert one end of each of the EMG electrodes subcutaneously to a length of ~2.0 cm through the neck incision. Fix the EMG electrodes to the neck muscle by suturing.\n3. Implantation of the Integrative Micro-Drive Array and the BR Electrodes\nFix the rat on a stereotaxic device. Make an incision of ~3.0 cm on the head along the midline from the point between the eyes to the neck area. Expose the skull.\nMake two circular craniotomies with diameters of 0.7-1.0 mm above the olfactory bulb 11.0 mm anterior and 1 mm bilateral to bregma with a high-speed drill. Implant two BR electrodes in the skull until the tips of the screw stems are attached to the brain surface.\nMake two circular craniotomies with diameters of 0.7-1.0 mm above the frontal cortex 2.7 mm anterior and 2.7 mm bilateral to bregma. Implant two g/r electrodes in the skull until the tip of the screw stem is attached to the brain surface.\nMake six to eight holes with diameters of 1.0 mm in the area surrounding the large craniotomy. Implant anchor screws (stem diameter: 1.4 mm, stem length: 3.0 mm) in the skull.\nMake a large circular craniotomy with a diameter of ~2.0 mm above the hippocampus 3.8 mm posterior and 2.5 mm bilateral to bregma. Place the integrative micro-drive array such that the cannula tip of the drive array is located above the large craniotomy\nFill the gap space between the cannula tip and the brain surface with ~100 µL of two solutions, i.e., 0.5% (by mass) sodium alginate and 10% (by mass) calcium chloride.\n\tNOTE: This process forms a transparent gel in ~5 min, after the two solutions are mixed on the skull.",
    "Cover the cannula, BR electrodes, g/r electrodes, and anchor screws with dental cement with a thickness of 0.5 cm. Be careful NOT to cover the open ends of BR and g/r electrodes with the cement at this step.\nSolder the open ends of the ECG, EMG, BR and g/r electrodes to the individual wire tips that were previously connected to the EIB (see the steps 1.2 and 1.3).\nCover the bottom part of the integrative micro-drive array, and all electrode wires, with dental cement. Ensure that all the electrode wires are completely covered so that the rat cannot scratch them out after the implantation. \nAfter regaining sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency, return the animal to its transparent Plexiglas home cag, and keep it on its own with free access to water and food. After the surgery, treat the animal with antibiotics (gentamicin).\nAfter the surgery, monitor the animals with daily observation. Check that they walk properly, and that they do not squeak when the experimenter touches the micro-drive array.   \n4. In Vivo Recordings\nNOTE: All signals are amplified, sampled at 2 kHz, and band-pass filtered (0.1 - 500 Hz) except for unit activities (sampled at 30 kHz and band-pass filtered (500 - 6 kHz)).\nConnect the EIB of the integrative micro-drive array to the headstage of a recording device.\nAdvance the tetrodes by turning the screws for a few weeks after surgery. Once the tetrodes are adjacent to the target brain areas, settle the tetrodes into the areas over a period of several days for stable recordings.\nMonitor the electrical signals while the animal freely moves in a recording chamber.\nSubscription Required.
