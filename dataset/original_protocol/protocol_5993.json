    "Note: This protocol is optimized for Drosophila S2R+ cells. However, we expect it to be transferrable to any cell type that can be efficiently transfected. All steps involving manipulation of cultured cells should be performed using sterile technique in a suitable tissue culture hood. Preparation of cells for transfection (or ‘Plating Cells’)Culture cells using standard methods in culture media so that they are approximately 80% confluent on the day of transfection.On the day of transfection, plate 1.5 x 104 cells in 100 µl culture media per well of a 96-well plate.Place plated cells in a 25 °C incubator for 20 min to 1 h to allow for adhesion prior to addition of transfection mixture (see Step B3).Note: The seeding density of cells should be optimized for each cell type and growth condition. Transfection protocol using FuGENE® HD transfection reagentNotes: The following transfection protocol will result in ten-fold more transfection mixture than is necessary. This is to prevent the need to pipette very small volumes. While we typically use FuGENE® HD reagent, we expect this method to work with any similar reagent.Defrost shRNA library plates with each shRNA at 45 ng/µl in water.Note: Library plates should contain positive and negative control reagents, with at least 5 wells of each to allow assessment of noise in the resulting screen data.  In a 96-well PCR plate, mix 90 ng shRNA plasmid, 20 ng actin-GFP, 90 ng actin-GAL4.Note: Although in theory the three plasmids should be delivered together, a higher ratio of shRNA to GFP is needed to minimize the chance that cells would be transfected with GFP but without corresponding delivery of shRNA. In cases where only shRNA is delivered, the cells will be GFP negative and will therefore not be analyzed during cytometry.",
    "Add the appropriate amount of filter-sterilized PBS to bring total volume to 10 µl. Add 0.6 µl of FuGENE® HD transfection reagent to each well and mix gently by pipetting. Note: Add FuGENE® HD transfection reagent directly to the DNA mixture. Do not allow undiluted reagent to contact the sides of the tube. Avoid introducing bubbles when mixing. Incubate for 20 min at room temperature in a sterile tissue culture hood.Transfer 1 µl of transfection mixture from each well of the PCR plate to the cell culture plate, careful to not introduce any air bubbles. Note: Avoid edge effects by leaving the edge wells untransfected.  Seal the 96-well plate with Parafilm and incubate cells at 25 °C for 5 days in a humidifying chamber.Note: A simple humidifying chamber can be constructed from a plastic bin or Tupperware containing a moist paper towel. Check periodically to make sure the paper towel remains moist and add more water if necessary. Collect data using flow cytometryInitialize and configure the flow cytometer according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Adjust acquisition settings to record 20,000 events per sample (“All Events”). Adjust gain or laser power settings if necessary to ensure all events are within the detectable range. Make sure that the same settings are applied to every well in the plate. Load the plate and acquire data, following the gating strategy shown in Figure 2. Note that the specific methods to load the plate, set up gates and acquire data will vary depending on the cytometer used. Follow manufacturer’s instructions to ensure appropriate set-up. A helpful explanation of the basics of flow cytometry as well as methods used to analyze and interpret data can be found in Jaroszeski and Radcliff (1999).Export .fcs files for all GFP-expressing cells (Gate P3) for further analysis. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181214/20181214001817_7527.jpgFigure 2.",
    "Gating strategy for VDA assays. A. Select live cells by plotting forward vs. side scatter and setting a gate as shown. B. Distinguish single cells from doublets by plotting forward scatter–area against forward scatter–height. C. Identify GFP positive cells by plotting GFP fluorescence (FITC filter in this case) against an unused and spectrally distinct filter (APC in this case). D. Statistics view to assess transfection efficiency (P3, % parent).Note: VDA does not require a very high transfection efficiency. However, low efficiency (< 20%) can indicate unhealthy cells, which may affect results."
