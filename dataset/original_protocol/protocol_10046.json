    "1. Fabrication of hybrid gel cube device\nPrepare a polycarbonate (PC) cubic frame either by using a machining process or a 3D printer. The size of the PC frame depends on the sample size. In this study, we used a frame of 5 mm on each side so that the branches had sufficient space to elongate during culturing.\nPlace the PC frame on a pre-cooled glass slide or another smooth surface in an ice box (<0 °C) (Figure 1A).\nAdd 12 µL of pre-heated 1.5% agarose (w/v) from the top face of the cubic frame to the bottom surface with a pipette. Stroke the pipette so that the agarose spreads to create a flat surface (Figure 1B).\nWithin minutes, the agarose will be cured. Pick up the PC frame by sliding it to the edge of the glass slide using tweezers. Note that vertically picking up the frame from the glass slide may result in detaching of the agarose from the cubic frame owing to the adhesive force between the agarose and the glass slide (Figure 1C).\nRotate the cubic frame to make the open face down, and then place on the glass slide again (Figure 1D).\nRepeat steps 1.3–1.5 until three surfaces are filled with agarose (Figure 1E).\nTo form an agarose wall on the fourth and fifth faces, drop the agarose in from an open face (Figure 1F). Once an agarose wall is formed on the fifth face, the preparation of the HGC is completed.\n2. Fabrication of micromolds by photolithography or a machining process\nFabrication by photolithography",
    "Clean a silicon (Si) wafer via ultrasonic cleaning with acetone, isopropyl alcohol (IPA), then distilled (DI) water for 5 min each. After nitrogen blowing the Si wafer with nitrogen, dehydrate in an oven at 140 °C for 20 min (Figure 2A(i)).\nSpin-coat a sacrificial layer such as LOR and Az resists on the Si wafer (2,000 rpm, 30 s) by using a spin-coater under yellow light. Immediately after spin-coating, heat the wafer on a hot plate at 90 °C for 3 min (Figure 2A(ii)). The desired thickness of the sacrificial layer is more than 1 µm so that the lift off process can be carried out easily, but an accurate thickness is not necessary.\nPlace the wafer on a hot plate at 70 °C, and then laminate a thick negative photoresist sheet with the desired thickness on the sacrificial layer using a hand roller (Figure 2A(iii))\nFive minutes after lamination, place the wafer on a mask aligner for UV exposure. Set a photomask with the desired pattern on the sheet resist and expose with UV light for an appropriate time duration. The exposure time is determined by the thickness of photoresist and the intensity of the UV light. Subsequently, place the wafer on a hot plate for a post-exposure bake at 60 °C for 5 min, followed by baking at 90 °C for 10 min. (Figure 2A(iv))\nDevelop a negative photoresist by immersing the wafer in propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PGMEA) until the unexposed area is completely dissolved (approximately 20 min) (Figure 2A(v)).\nDissolve the sacrificial layer by using IPA for ultrasonic cleaning to lift off the microstructure. Once the microstructure is peeled off from the wafer, rinse with DI water by ultrasonic cleaning for 10 min (Figure 2A(vi)).",
    "Immerse the mold in 30 µL of the MPC polymer for 30 min at room temperature (approximately 20 °C) to completely dry it out. Figure 2B shows the fabricated prism mold.\nFabrication of a cylinder mold\n\t\nFabricate a steel cylinder mold with desired size by a machining process. Alternatively, use commercially available stainless steel. (In this study, a φ 600 µm cylinder is used.)\nImmerse the cylinder steel in 30 µL of the MPC polymer for 30 min at room temperature (approximately 20 °C) to completely dry it out.\nPrepare liquid polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) by mixing base resin and its catalyst (see Table of Materials) in a 10:1 ratio followed by degassing with a vacuum degassing system for 20 min. Then pour the PDMS in a 12-well-plate.\nSet the steel cylinder perpendicular to the datum surface and fixed to a linear z-stage so that it can be perpendicularly inserted in the uncured PDMS surface in a 12-well-plate placed on the same datum surface by moving the z-stage. Incubate the PDMS with the cylinder steel in an oven for 20 min at 90 °C for curing. Cut the PDMS to form a flank surface so that the pipet can be inserted in the following process (Figure 2C).\n3. Controlling initial cell cluster shape in a hydrogel\nInject an appropriate ECM for the desired cell culture, such as collagen and artificial basement membrane, into the HGC to fill the culture space (Figure 3A).\nSet the fabricated micromold on the HGC directly or indirectly with an appropriate holder, as shown in Figure 3B. Subsequently, place the HGC in a CO2 incubator for 25 min at 37 °C for curing it.",
    "Carefully lift out the micromold so that the ECM does not deteriorate (Figure 3C). The pocket, as the desired mold shape, will be fabricated in the ECM.\nHarvest cells from the cultured dish by trypsin–EDTA or its equivalent depending on the cell types. Subsequently, centrifuge the cells to obtain highly concentrated cells (for NHBE culture, apply 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and incubate cells for 3 min, then neutralize with FBS-containing medium and centrifuging at 300 x g for 4 min).\nAfter centrifuging, remove the supernatant medium to condense the cells, and inject highly concentrated cells (3.0 × 104 cells/µL for NHBE cells) into the pocket in the ECM (Figure 3D).\nIncubate the HGC with cells in a CO2 incubator for 20 min at 37 °C so that the cells fall into the ECM pocket to fill the space created by the micromolds. If excessive medium or cells are present on the top surface, carefully remove using a pipette.\nPlace the HGC on a 24-well-plate and add 100 µL of appropriate medium (Figure 3E). For NHBE cells, use a 1:1 mixture of commercially available specialized medium for NHBE and endothelial cells (see Table of Materials).\nInject additional ECM to close the pocket in the ECM, and then incubate at 37 °C for 25 min.\nCool down preheated 1.5% agarose to room temperature (approximately 20 °C). Drop approximately 10 µL of the agarose onto the top surface of the HGC to close the surface and prevent the ECM from falling out of the HGC during culturing and imaging (Figure 3F). Then, incubate the HGC for another 20 min at 37 °C to cure the agarose.\nAdd medium to cover the entire HGC so that the osmotic pressure can help in providing nutrition to the cells inside the HGC.\n4. Multi-directional imaging",
    "Non-invasive 3D shape recognition by multi-directional observation\n\t\nPlace the culture dish or well plate containing the HGC on a microscope and orient the HGC to the camera frame. Then, obtain a sample image by bright field or phase contrast.\nPick up and rotate the HGC to place a different surface down.\nRepeat steps 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 until images from all six sides are obtained.\nImmuno-fluorescent imaging by multi-directional observation\n\t\nFor fixation, apply 4% paraformaldehyde to the sample over the HGC at room temperature (approximately 20 °C) for 20 min, followed by two rinses of PBS for 10 min each.\nPermeabilize the HGC with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 4 °C, then wash 3x for 10 min with PBS.\nIncubate the HGC with 10% goat serum in IF-buffer (0.2% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS) for 60 min at room temperature for a primary blocking step.\nFor staining of a specific molecule, use the appropriate antibody. To observe the collective cell geometry, Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin can be used to stain actin.\nPlace the HGC on a glass bottom dish under a laser or fluorescent microscope and perform scanning from six sides to obtain the entire sample image.\nSubscription Required.
