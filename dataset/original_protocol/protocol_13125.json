(A) Tandem transcription from a linearized plasmid template with T7RNAP (left) and successive cleavage by RNAse H of the transcript to achieve target length RNA, directed by a chimeric DNA guide (right). (B) Detailed schematic of the tandem template starting with the viral T7RNAP promoter, an initiation sequence. The target sequence (dark blue, example here is 20 nt long) is repeated “n” times. The repeats flanked by a 5′ and 3′ spacer sequences consisting of the last eight and first four nucleotides, respectively, to allow for removal of the initiation and restriction sequences from the first and last repeat unit. (C) Hybridization of the tandem transcript (red) and the chimeric cleavage guides (green). RNase H cleaves the RNA opposite to the DNA 5′ end. The 2′-OMe RNA flanks increase specificity by enhancing the binding affinity of cleavage guide to the target RNA. This figure has been modified from 21. Abbreviations: T7RNAP = T7 RNA polymerase.

Preparing work for a new RNA construct\nPlasmid design and preparation\n\t\nWrite the template sequence in a cloning tool, e.g., Serial Cloner.\nTake the T7 promotor sequence and add a high-yield initiation sequence (T7: 5'-TAATACGACTCACTATA ^GGGAGA-3').\n\t\tNOTE: Transcription will start at the nucleotide indicated with a caret (^). The initiation sequence GGGAGA is variable, but strongly sequence-dependent; therefore, the use of this sequence is recommended.\nAdd the last 8 nucleotides (nt) of the target sequence as a 5' spacer (5'S).\nAdd repeats of the target sequence (TS).\nAdd the first four nucleotides as a 3' spacer after the repeats (5'S).\nAdd a BamHI restriction site (RS) or similar unique restriction site.",
    "NOTE: The total sequence as shown will be cloned or readily ordered in a bacterial high-copy plasmid (e.g., pUC19): 5'-T7-5'S-(TS)n-3'S-RS-3' (Figure 2B). The number of repeats should be as high as allowed by gene synthesis ( a maximum of 600 nt in this protocol).\nAmplify the plasmid in E. coli using a commercial kit.\nLinearize the purified plasmid at 20 ng/µL using the appropriate restriction site. Scale restriction digests with BamHI by up to 1 mL.\nPurify the digested plasmid, and confirm successful linearization on a 1% agarose gel. Store the linearized plasmid at -20 °C for several months.\nCleavage guide design (Figure 2C)\n\t\nWrite the last eight nucleotides of the target RNA sequence in the 5'-3' direction, and add the first four nucleotides of the target RNA sequence on the 3' end also in the 5'-3' direction.\nGenerate the reverse DNA complement of that sequence\nChange the first and last four nucleotides to their 2'-OMe modifications by adding an 'm' before the nucleotide letter.\n\t\tNOTE: For synthesis, mU is used instead of mT.\nOrder the oligo with standard desalting purification.\n\t\tNOTE: Check if the generated oligo could bind at another place other than the connection of two RNA sequences. Full complementarity in the central four DNA nucleotides is required, while the flanking regions could permit a mismatch. If necessary, extend the flanks to up to 18 nt to generate a unique binding sequence36.\nSmall-scale IVT\n\tNOTE: For RNase-free work, prepare all reagents under sterile and RNase-free conditions. Use RNase decontamination reagent (see the Table of Materials) and 95% v/v ethanol to clean work surfaces and pipettes before use. Wash gloves with 95% ethanol and wear lint-free long-sleeved clothes. To minimize RNase contamination, do not breathe over open tubes.",
    "Prepare stock solutions of Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), dithiothreitol, MgCl2, spermidine, and NTPs/GMP (unbuffered). Mix reagents as shown in Table 1. Prepare a master mix of these reagents in advance, before the addition of enzymes or nucleic acids.\n\t\tNOTE: If using frozen reagents, thoroughly mix them after thawing. Reagents might precipitate if mixed at too high concentrations, so it is strongly recommended to follow the order in Table 1.\nAdd in the following order: plasmid, cleavage guide, inorganic phosphatase (IPPase), RNase H, T7RNAP. As enzyme activity might vary for enzymes produced in-house, test several concentrations before selecting the best one.\n\t\tNOTE: Include a negative control for the cleavage reaction, e.g., without RNase H, to attribute a missing target band to flawed RNase H cleavage and not to unsuccessful transcription.\nIncubate the reaction at 37 °C for 1 h and confirm reaction on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (Figure 3A). Dilute the sample 10-fold in loading solution, and load 1 µL onto the gel.\n\t\tNOTE: Gel mixture: 8 M urea, 20% acrylamide (19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) in 1x TBE. Loading solution: 5 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), 300 µM bromophenol blue in formamide. RNase H cleavage reactions cannot be expected to be complete after 1 h, as new RNA is produced constantly. At this point, look out for a clear target band and the absence of a species of similar molecular weight (e.g., ±3 nucleotide (nt) products).\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2\nReagent,Stock concentration,Amount small scale (µL)\nH2O,-,24\nTris,1 M,5\nMgCl2,1 M,0.5\nDTT,1 M,0.5\nSpermidine,250 mM,5\nGMP,100 mM,2.5\nATP,100 mM,1.5\nGTP,100 mM,1.5\nUTP,100 mM,1.5\nCTP,100 mM,1.5\nPlasmid,20 ng/µL,5\nCleavage guide,100 µM,10\niPPase,10 mg/mL,0.5\nRNase H,10 µg/mL,2\nT7 RNA polymerase,5 mg/mL,2",

If RNase H cleavage must be performed after T7 IVT, add cleavage guide and RNase H after heat-inactivation of T7RNAP. Amounts used scale linearly with reaction scale. Abbreviations: T7RNAP = T7 RNA polymerase; IVT = in vitro transcription.\n2. NMR sample preparation\nScale up the reaction to the desired volume (typically 10 mL), and run the reaction overnight. Test for reaction completion the next day with a denaturing PAGE gel (Figure 3A).\n\tNOTE: Incomplete cleavage reaction is shown by higher molecular weight species above the target band.\n\t\nIf cleavage was not successful or complete, reanneal RNA and the cleavage guide in the reaction vessel by heating the solution in a conventional microwave at 450 W for 15 s.\nCool the solution slowly to 37 °C for 40 min. Use a heating block for volumes below 1 mL. Note the formation of new precipitate.\nAdd more IPPase and RNase H, and incubate for another 1-3 h at 37 °C. Confirm completion of the cleavage reaction with denaturing PAGE.\nWhen the RNase H cleavage reaction is completed, quench the reaction by adding EDTA to 50 mM final concentration and vortex thoroughly.\n\t\tNOTE: Potential pyrophosphate precipitation will dissolve, and new protein precipitate forms.\nFilter the solution through a 0.2 µm syringe filter, and concentrate to a volume injectable into an HPLC system, depending on the injection loop size.\n\t\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here by freezing sample at -20 °C.\nLarge-scale HPLC purification\n\t\nPrepare ion-exchange buffers A and B within one week of use. Filter and degas the buffers.",
    "NOTE: Buffer A: 20 mM sodium acetate; 20 mM sodium perchlorate, pH 6.5. Buffer B: 20 mM sodium acetate; 600 mM sodium perchlorate, pH 6.5.\nEquilibrate the column with 100% buffer B followed by 100% buffer A for at least 2 column volumes at 75 °C.\nPrepare the HPLC sequence (Figure 3B) at a flow rate of 5.5 mL/min. Use the following sequence for purification of an RNA sized between 20 and 30 nt: 0-7 min: 0% B; 7-16 min: gradient 0-20% B; 16-46 min: elution, typically with a gradient of 20-30% B (optimize according to needs); 46-62 min: 100% B; 62-73 min: 0% B.\n\t\tNOTE: A change in flow rate from 5.5 to 8 mL/min did not influence the separation in this protocol.\nOptimize the elution gradient by the injection of an equivalent to 1 mL of transcription reaction (unlabeled) at a time.\n\t\tNOTE: For further details and discussion, refer to Karlsson et al.31 and Feyrer et al.21.\nTest the collected fractions on a denaturing PAGE. If the main elution peak is well isolated and contains the pure target RNA, scale up the purification to an equivalent of 10 mL of transcription reaction.\nCollect the fractions of interest, concentrate, and exchange the buffer with NMR buffer. Use an ultracentrifugal filter unit (see the Table of Materials) for volumes above 50 mL.\n\t\tNOTE: NMR buffer: 15 mM sodium phosphate; 25 mM sodium chloride; 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 6.5. To minimize loss from RNA adhering to plastic tube walls, wash all collection tubes with 1 mL of water, vortex, and centrifuge to collect all liquid.\nDetermine the concentration via ultraviolet spectroscopy. Calculate the reaction yield according to Feyrer et al21.",
    "NOTE: The concentration of an NMR sample for RD experiments should not be below 130 nmol, which corresponds to 500 µM in a sample volume of 250 µL using NMR tubes (Table of Materials).\nFolding of an RNA sample\n\t\nDilute and aliquot the sample of a volume of ~10 mL into 1 mL per tube.\nHeat the RNA aliquots to 95 °C for 5 min.\nSnap-cool the samples by placing them on ice or in a water-ice-salt mixture and incubate for 30 min.\nPool samples and concentrate to ~250 µL in a 2 mL centrifugal filter unit.\nFilling of an NMR tube\n\t\nClean the NMR tube in the NMR tube cleaner by flushing with abundant water, RNase decontamination reagent, water, 95% ethanol (EtOH), and water again. Leave to dry.\nClean the plunger by rinsing with water and wiping with RNase decontamination reagent and 95% EtOH using a lint-free wipe. Leave to dry.\nAdd 10% (v/v) of D2O to the NMR sample.\nFill the RNA sample into the NMR tube using a large pipette tip. Let the liquid flow along the side of the tube wall.\nInsert the plunger and remove air bubbles by pushing the plunger down together with a fast twisting motion.\nPull the plunger up slowly without creating new air bubbles and fix it with paraffin wax film.\nConfirm folding by NMR.",
    "NOTE: At this point, it is necessary to perform at least partial resonance assignment to confirm the secondary structure of the RNA sample and to identify regions of interest for the study of conformational dynamics. An exhaustive description on RNA resonance assignment would exceed this protocol, therefore we refer to well-established literature at this point19,37,38. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) can be a helpful indicator of RNA folding and serve as complementary data for NMR experiments.\n\t\nCompare the following spectra of the sample for which 1H R1ρ RD experiments are performed with the properly folded reference sample (Figure 4): 1H 1D, especially the imino region 10–15 ppm; Aromatic 1H,13C-HSQC; 1H,1H-SELOPE (optional).\n\t\tNOTE: An aromatic fingerprint is also necessary, even in case of agreement between imino signals, because dimer formation often shows the same or similar imino signals as an RNA hairpin. The SELOPE experiment can replace an 1H,13C-HSQC for aromatic fingerprinting, as heteronuclear experiments on unlabeled samples are very time-consuming.\nUse the UUCG loop as a fingerprint reference (if present).\nPerform this comparison every time before 1H R1ρ RD experiments are recorded.\n3. 1H R1ρ Relaxation dispersion—on-resonance (labeled 1D version) \nNOTE: The steps below describe the setup of RD experiments for a labeled sample using the 1D version of the HSQC-based RD pulse sequence. Follow the same steps for the SELOPE-based 1D sequence for unlabeled samples. An overview of parameter names and settings for both cases are shown in Table 2. The focus on 1D versions is because they are more practical for off-resonance measurements, and the setup of the 2D versions of the SELOPE and HSQC-based experiments have been discussed in detail by Schlagnitweit et al.20 and Steiner et al.10, respectively.\nDetermine 1H power for a hard 90° pulse (P1).\n\t\nOption A: Use Bruker pulsecal command.",
    "Option B: In a zg experiment, determine the 360° pulse by measuring a nutation curve at the proton hard-pulse power level on the water peak.\n\t\tNOTE: The 90° pulse length is a fourth of the duration where zero signal is observed (if a full nutation curve is measured, then it is the second zero; however, in practice, only the region around the expected value for the 360° is sampled).\n Run a 1H 1D spectrum zgesgp.f2f3dec using the pulse length determined in step 3.1 to confirm the RNA folding before every R1ρ measurement.\n\tNOTE: If 1H SL experiments are run for the first time, check if the calculated SL power corresponds to the power delivered to the sample by calibrating SL power for each desired bandwidth. Detailed calibration steps are described in Steiner et al.10.\nCreate a 1H R1ρ for labeled data set, and set key parameters.\n\t\nCreate a new data set; ideally based on a 1H-13C aromatic HSQC data set as used on fully labeled RNA samples for RNA assignment.\n\t\tNOTE: This will ensure that 13C as well as 15N power and decoupling power are already set up.\nSet the general parameters according to the first part of Table 2.\nSet RD-specific parameters according to the second part of Table 2.\nSet 1H SL power to the lowest value (1.2 kHz) for testing.\nGenerate a test vd list with only one entry, 0 ms, (to optimize the vd list, as described in step 3.4), set TDF1 to 1, and update D30.\nRun a test spectrum with these settings.\nOptimize the vd list (list of SL lengths to be used).",
    "Run the experiment with a test vd list (e.g., six entries: 0 m, 5 m, 10 m, 20 m, 30 m, 40 m; scramble these values to avoid systematic errors due to heating).\nUpdate D30 and TDF1 accordingly (in this example, D30 = 42m and TDF1 = 6).\nPlot intensity of the peak vs. SL length. Identify the SL length at which the intensity of the original peak decreases to 1/3.\nCreate the final vd list to be used in the experiment, taking into consideration the following: determine the longest SL length as described in the previous step; avoid using a list with decreasing or ascending order; and add some duplicates for statistical studies. Remember to update D30 and TDF1 every time there are any changes in the vd list.\n\t\tNOTE: The experiment is run with different SL lengths as given in the vd list in a pseudo-2D way.\nSelect the number of scans so that the weakest peak of the list has a signal-to-noise ratio (SINO) of at least 10.\n\t\t​NOTE: Although the vd list was optimized for a low SL power (1.2 kHz), this vd list should also be tested at the highest SL power to be used (e.g., 15 kHz). This is because the decay will be much slower at high SL power for peaks with significant kEX contribution. Therefore, a sufficient decay should also be verified at high SL power.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2\nParameter Description,Parameter name in pulse sequence,Parameter name in pulse sequence\nParameter Description,1D labeled,1D SELOPE\npulse program for on-resonance 1Ds,1HR1rho_HCP_onres1D.es,1HR1r_HH_onres1D.js\n1H carrier frequencies (ppm),O1P = water resonance in ppm,O1P = chemical shift of peak of interest (ppm)\n,CNST28 = chemical shift of peak of interest (ppm),CNST29 = water resonance in ppm",

    "Set-up and acquisition of on-resonance 1H R1ρ experiments\n\t\nCopy the experiment from section 3.4 into a new folder in Topspin.\nIn this folder, set up experiments at different SL strengths, each time changing PL25 and CNST12. Determine the correct power level for each SL strength by using the pulse command. Use SL strengths ranging from 1.2 to 15 kHz, with a denser sampling for lower SL strengths (see Figure 5G for selected SL strengths). Add copies of some of the experiments to have duplicates for some of the SL strengths.\nRun these experiments.\nAnalysis of on-resonance 1H R1ρ experiments\n\t\nIn TopSpin, process each slice of each pseudo-2D data set using the same processing parameters (e.g., line broadening, phase) using the command xf2, and split the dataset into 1Ds using the Bruker AU program split2D.\nObtain signal intensities and volumes for each 1D slice.\n\t\tNOTE: In practice, it is better to deconvolve the spectra to get rid of contributions from potentially overlapping peaks and allows the usage of the Bruker AU program multidcon, which conveniently summarizes the intensities or areas of the peaks of all slices in one experiment in the text file decall.txt, which can then be read out easily with other programs (Python scripts written in-house were used here, as described by Steiner et al.10) in steps 3.6.3 and 3.6.4.\nFit a mono exponential decay for each SL strength to obtain the R1ρ (or on-resonance, R2+REX) value.\nPlot those R2+REX values (y) vs. SL strength (x) (Figure 5F,G).",
    "NOTE: If the values are significantly higher for low SL strengths and decrease with higher SL power (as shown in Figure 5G), then the investigated peak shows dispersion, and it might be interesting to carry out additional (off-resonance) experiments to obtain information about the population and chemical shift difference of the excited state vs. the ground state.\n4. 1H R1ρ Relaxation dispersion—off-resonance (labeled 1D version)\nSet-up and acquisition of off-resonance 1H R1ρ experiments\n\t\nIn a new topspin folder, set up experiments at a certain SL strength (usually first at the lowest SL strength as the REX contribution is highest there, see Figure 5G for a representative selection of off-resonance SLs), but with different offsets, each time changing CNST30.\nUse offsets up to ± (3 or 4)*SL strength, with a denser sampling around 0 offset, as can be seen in Figure 5H,I.\nRun these experiments.\nAnalysis of off-resonance 1H R1ρ experiments\n\t\nUse the same processing strategy, as in 3.6.1–3.6.3, to determine an R1ρ value for each offset.\nPlot those values vs. offset (Figure 5G).\n\t\tNOTE: An asymmetry in this curve can already indicate that chemical shift information for the excited state can be obtained. Thorough fitting and analysis using Bloch-McConnell or Laguerre equations have to be carried out to obtain information on kEX, pES as well as Δω10,20 (Figure 5G). Example datasets, pulse programs, and macros for both 1D experiments can be found on the Petzold Lab Github repository (https://github.com/PetzoldLab). An overview of parameters is given in Table 2."
