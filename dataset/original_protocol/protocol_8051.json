    "1. Preparation of the sucrose-yeast (SY) diets\nWeigh all the dry ingredients (agar, yeast, sucrose) for the macronutrient balancing and L3 rearing diets. The amounts in grams for each of the ingredients needed to prepare 1 L of food are indicated in Figure 1B.\n\tNOTE: Take into account that approximately 13 mL of food is needed to fill a 60-mm Petri dish.\nDissolve all ingredients in sterile distilled water (use approximately 50% of the total volume of water needed to prepare the food) and stir the medium for 5-10 min.\nAutoclave for 50 min.\nAfter allowing the mediums to cool down, add nipagin and propionic acid solutions to the diets, at a final concentration (v/v) of 3% and 0.3%, respectively. To the macronutrient balancing diets, add blue food dye to a final concentration (v/v) of 1%. Complete the total volumes with distilled water.\nCarefully pour the food diets to 60 mm Petri dishes, so that the quantity of food poured is approximately the same in each one of the plates. Label the plates with the P:C ratios of the diets.\n\tNOTE: Prepare the macronutrient balancing diets on the day of the feeding assay. If not possible, store the prepared diets at 4 ˚C, in a sealed container, for a maximum duration of 3 days. Longer storage periods render the diet too dry and hard, and the larvae cannot burrow into the medium.\n2. Genetic cross of parental lines",
    "NOTE: Use the Gal4/UAS system21 to set up the genetic crosses. In this protocol, in order to activate neuronal function in specific neuronal populations, female virgins of the UAS dTRPA1 line17 were used and crossed to males from the Janelia Gal4 lines (Figure 2A). The genetic control used was the progeny of a cross between the dTRPA1 line and an “empty GAL4” line, which carries Gal4 in the vector used to generate the Rubin Gal4 collection but with no regulatory fragment present (attP2)22. To promote the neuronal suppression, a UAS line encoding ShibireTS20 can be used, instead of dTRPA1.\nSet up 60 mm embryo collection cages with L3 rearing diet plates, supplemented with some active yeast paste.\nTransfer the adult UAS dTRPA1 female virgins and Janelia Gal4 males, aged 5-8 days, to the embryo collection cages and allow the mating to occur for 24-48 h, at 25 °C, with 60% humidity and a 12:12 light-dark cycle (Figure 2A). For 60 mm embryo collection cages, use around 100 virgin females and 30 males per cross.\nIn the end of the mating period, remove and discard the L3 rearing diet plates used in the genetic crosses. Substitute them for fresh L3 rearing diet plates, in order to perform the egg lays and larval staging.\n3. Preparation of third-instar larvae (L3)\nTransfer the mated adult flies to fresh L3 rearing diet plates and allow the egg-laying to occur for 3-4 h, at 25 °C (Figure 2B). Make sure that all the plates are labeled with the genotype, P:C ratio of the diet and date of the egg lay.",
    "NOTE: To save time, perform the egg-laying directly into the L3 rearing diet, which avoids extra handling of the eggs. In the case of small-scale genetic screenings, optimization of the egg-laying can be obtained by using apple juice agar plates.\nIn the end of the egg laying period, remove the plates from the cages and cover them with plastic lids. In case yeast extract is used to supplement the L3 rearing plates, make sure to remove all the residual yeast in the end of the egg laying. This is important to avoid non-uniform feeding during the larval growth.\n\tNOTE: The mated adults can be transferred to fresh L3 rearing diet plates, so more egg lays are performed, and more experimental larvae can be obtained. Consecutive egg-lays can be performed with the same adults during one entire working week.\nEstimate the number of eggs per plate and keep the larval density to a maximum of 200 embryos per plate. This estimation can be done by counting the number of embryos in one quarter of the plate.\n\tNOTE: An overcrowded plate will delay larval development and affect larval feeding behaviors.\nIncubate the L3 rearing plates at 18 ˚C (permissive temperature), 60% humidity and a 12:12 light-dark cycle, and allow the larvae to grow for 9 days (Figure 2B).",
    "On the ninth day after egg laying (AEL), collect three groups of 10 L3 from each of the genotypes (and for the replicates) to be tested. Additionally, collect groups of 10 L3 for the “zero-dye food” control. Ensure that the larvae collection is done during equivalent time periods of the day used to do the egg lay (e.g., if the egg laying occurred between 10am-2pm, collect the larvae during the same period of time 9 days AEL) and is performed, as gently as possible, by using forceps #5 or a featherweight forceps. Directly transfer the larvae as indicated in next step (3.6).\n\tNOTE: The \"zero-dye food\" control animals are larvae that in the feeding assay are given food without blue-dye. This control is imperative to remove the background absorbance of th larval extracts.\nTransfer the collected experimental larvae to plastic dish weight boats containing 1 mL of water. Make sure L3 are collected, and not L2, by following the directions given in Figure 3.\n\tNOTE: The collection of L3 to plastic boats containing water or 1x Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), is important to keep larvae well hydrated before the start of the feeding assay. This is especially important if several experimental L3 groups from different genotypes are being collected at the same time. Keep track of the collection order for each group, so differences in the duration of food-deprivation for each group are minimized. The use of plastic boats in this step facilitates the optional step 4.3 as it enables larvae to float directly into the water bath.\n4. Thermogenetic activation and no-choice feeding assay",
    "NOTE: It is recommended to perform the feeding assays at approximately the same time of the day to minimize possible variations related to the circadian rhythms. Also, always run the control experiments (the progeny of the “empty Gal4” line crossed to UAS dTRPA1 and the “zero-dye food” larvae), in parallel with the genotypes of interest.\nSet up an incubator to 30 ˚C (non-permissive temperature) and keep high levels of humidity (at least 65%) to avoid larval dehydration during the assay.\nBefore starting the feeding assay, equilibrate the assay plates’ temperature by warming them at 30 ˚C for 30 min.\n(Optional) Heat-shock the experimental larvae for 2 min in a 37 ˚ C water bath. Perform this step with the animals in the plastic weight boats containing some water.\n\tNOTE: The aim of this step is to intensify the neuronal activation by promoting the firing of the neurons since the beginning of the feeding assay.\nKeep multiple timers set for 1 h ready. The number of timers to be used depends on the number of experimental groups being tested and on the experimenter’s skillfulness level on handling larvae.\n\tNOTE: The use of multiple timers is critical to keep the duration of the assay consistent for all the genotypes.\nCarefully drain the water from the plastic boats and, using a moistened soft brush, gently transfer the L3 groups from the boats to the center of the assay plates. Put the plates’ lids back and start a timer for each plate (or group of plates) to maintain accurate 1-h feeding sessions.\nAllow the larvae to feed for 1 h, at 30 ˚C, in the dark (Figure 2C).",
    "NOTE: The performance of the assay in the dark is important to control for differences in the visual cues across diets, as the diets will differ in tones, even though they contain the same dye concentration.\nStop the feeding assay by transferring the plates to an ice bath. Press down the ice as much as possible to provide a stable surface for the plates.\n\tNOTE: Cold temperatures will promote the end of the feeding by inhibiting burrowing and digging behaviors. Most of the larvae will surface the food plates after some minutes, facilitating their recovery in the following steps.\n5. Food dye extraction\nPrepare 2 mL microtubes for each group of 10 L3 tested, containing approximately the same amounts of 0.5 mm-glass beads (enough to fill the bottom portion of the microtube) and 300 μL of ice-cold methanol. Keep the microtubes in the cold, using a bench cooler.\n\tCAUTION: Methanol is highly flammable and toxic. Follow all safety procedures recommended for handling this reagent, including working in a well-ventilated area and wearing nitrile gloves.\n\tNOTE: The use of methanol is important to fix the larval samples and avoid melanization reactions in the cuticle.\nUsing #5 or featherweight-forceps, carefully recover the groups of 10 L3 from the feeding assay plates and transfer them to the lids of the assay plates containing some water. Rinse the larvae to remove any food debris on their bodies while gently handling the larvae to avoid any injuries. Keep a record of the number of larvae recovered for each genotype per replicate, so that the mean amount of food intake per larva can be quantified.\n\tNOTE: Injured larvae should be discarded as they will have melanized cuticle, being unsuitable for colorimetric quantification.\nTransfer the L3 groups to the 2 mL microtubes prepared in 5.1.",
    "Lyse the larval tissues to extract the food dye from the guts by a mechanical lysis method using a tissue lyzer and glass beads added in step 5.1. (if a tissue lyzer is not available, use a homogenizing pestle). Preferentially, perform this step at 4 °C (Figure 2D).\n\tNOTE: The duration of this step will depend on the equipment used. Using a conventional tissue lyser, 1 min extraction is sufficient. In case of time constrictions, the protocol can be paused in the end of this step and proceeded later. Store the samples at -20 °C.\nTransfer the extracts to clean 1.5 mL microtubes, by directly inverting the 2 mL microtubes onto the new 1.5 mL microtubes. If performed gently, most of the glass beads will stay at the bottom of the 2 mL microtube.\nClear the cellular debris by centrifuging the extracts, at a maximum speed for 10 min, at 4 °C.\nCollect the supernatants to clean 1.5 mL microtubes. If cellular debris are still visible in the supernatants, repeat steps 5.6 and 5.7.\n6. Colorimetric quantification of food consumption\nPrepare standard solutions, to generate a calibration curve, by performing serial 1:2 dilutions in methanol of a starting blue dye solution. As blank, use methanol only. The concentration of the standards is dependent on the animals’ levels of food intake.\n\tNOTE: In the case of the pilot screen presented here, as the dye concentrations obtained for the larval extracts ranged from 0.02 to 1.93 μL/mL, it was used a standard curve obtained by measuring the absorbances of 8 serial dilutions of a 2 μL/mL blue-dye solution in methanol. If needed, increase or decrease the concentration of these solutions, depending on the dye concentration of the experimental samples.",
    "Transfer 100 μL of the experimental samples (obtained in step 5.7), standards and blank (step 6.1) to the wells of a 96-well microplate and measure the absorbance at 600 nm, using a plate reader (Figure 2E). To remove the background absorbance, measure the absorbance of extracts obtained from larvae fed on food without blue-dye as a “zero” for the larval extracts (“zero-dye food control).\nGenerate a standard curve and correlate the absorbance values obtained for the samples from each experimental larval group with the amount of food intake (volume in mL). Find the average food consumption per larva by taking into account the number of larvae collected for each group in the step 5.2\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
