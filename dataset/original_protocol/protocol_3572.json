    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAnimal preparation for surgery\nTiming: 5–10 min\nInject the mouse with avertin 400 mg/kg intraperitoneally.\nAlternatives: The avertin can be replaced by anesthesia vaporizer with 1% isoflurane (30% O2, 70% N2O).\nWait until the mouse is fully anesthetized, then inject ketoprofen 3–5 mg/kg intraperitoneally to relieve pain.\nPlace the mouse on a heating pad to keep the steady body temperature.\nNote: When the mouse is anesthetized, it cannot regulate the body temperature. So placing it on the heating pad could avoid the body temperature drop significantly during the surgery process.\nApply an ocular lubricant on the eyes of the mouse to prevent the dryness during the surgery.\nAlternatives: The ocular lubricant can be replaced by the artificial tears.\nUse an electric razor to remove hair from the top of the head.\nSanitize the head skin with three alternate rounds of betadine and 70% ethanol.\nExposure of the skull and drilling\nTiming: 5–10 min\nLatch the front teeth of the mouse onto the anterior clamp of the adapter on the stereotactic instrument, then adjust the position of the adapter, so that the ear bars could easily insert into the ear canal to make the head fixed.\nNote: Make sure that the mouse head is fixed and firm onto the anterior clamp of the adapter.\nMake a 1.5 cm anterior-posterior incision using a scalpel.\nScrape away the periosteal connective tissue with the blunt edge of the scalpel handle.\nTake a sterile cotton swab to gently clean the surface of the skull and ensure the bregma and lambda visible (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/494-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Stereotactical injection of retroviruses into the dentate gyrus of adult hippocampus",
    "(A) The cranial structures on the mouse skull and the coordinates used for the injection: 2.0 mm posterior to the bregma (Y axis), ±1.7 mm lateral to the midline (X axis). Scale bar, 5 mm.\n(B) Two small holes were drilled for viral injection. Scale bar, 5 mm.\n(C) The needle of micro-syringe was placed onto the position before viral injection. Scale bar, 5 mm.\nPlace the microinjection syringe on the needle holder, move the needle tip to bregma, and write down the coordinate, which serves as the reference point of the three axes and determine coordinates from this point.\nPlace the needle tip on lambda, level the head by adjust the dorsal/ventral adjustment dial so that the z-coordinate is roughly equal at both bregma and lambda.\nPlace the needle tip to −2.0 mm posterior to the bregma, move the needle tip to ±1.7 mm lateral to the midline, and level the head so that the z-coordinate is roughly equal at both lateral sides (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nCritical: Ensure that the head is level by moving the needle tip on the intersection of bregma and interaural line and adjusting the z-coordinate.\nFind the coordinates based on the atlas of the mouse brain (Paxinos et al., 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) and target the dentate gyrus using the coordinates: −2.0 mm posterior to the bregma, ±1.7 mm lateral to the midline, −1.9 mm ventral to the surface of the skull.\nMove the syringe needle according above lateral coordinates and label two lateral coordinates with the scalpel tip to indicate their positions over the skull, which serve as the target drill sites.\nLift the syringe in the vertical axis and move the syringe tip to the security position.",
    "Drill two shallow holes by using a fine dental drill at the target drill sites over the skull (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nCritical: Be careful not to drill into the brain and prevent the cortical damage.\nRetroviral injection\nTiming: 30 min to 1 h\nClean the needle of microinjection syringe with sterile DPBS and withdraw 1 μL of the concentrated retroviral solution (titer greater than 5 × 108/mL).\nLower the needle tip above the target hole until it touches the surface of the skull.\nSet the depth/vertical coordinate as 0.\nLower the syringe to reach the dentate gyrus, set depth/vertical to 1.9 mm (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nCritical: Ensure that the syringe does not slip below the required depth. If this happens, gently lift the syringe to the desired depth.\nInject 1 μL retroviruses at a rate of 0.2 μL/min. After the injection is finished, wait for additional 2 min to ensure retroviruses full absorbed.\nSlowly remove the syringe out of the brain to prevent fluid backflow.\nRinse the external surface of the syringe tip with sterile DPBS and use sterile cotton swabs to remove traces of blood.\nRepeat steps 18–24 for another hemisphere.\nFor more detailed protocol of retroviral injection see (Fricano-Kugler et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Tang et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nWound suturing and post-operative care\nTiming: 30 min to 1 h\nClose the skin incision by using absorbable sutures.\nGently remove the ear bars and take the mouse from the stereotaxic instruments.\nPlace the mouse in a recovery cage and keep it on a heating pad.\nMonitor the mouse until it wakes up and moves around on its own.\nCritical: Place the mouse on a heating pad to avoid the body temperature drop significantly. When the mouse is anesthetized, it cannot regulate their body temperature.\nPreparation of mini-osmotic pump\nTiming: 1–2 days",
    "Mini-osmotic pump is an ideal system for prolonged direct drug delivery into specific brain region at a fixed flow rate (Reitmeir et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Wang et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). Adult neurogenesis can be divided into five phases: proliferation, fate determination, migration, maturation and integration at different time course (Bond et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). So implantation of mini-osmotic pump could be performed at a desired time after retroviral injection according the experimental purpose. Previously, we had implanted a mini-osmotic pump to study the role of pleiotrophin (PTN) on the development of newborn neurons after 2 weeks retroviral injection (Tang et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). A video guide providing excellent visual aid for this procedure may also be found at: https://www.jove.com/v/52932/implantation-miniosmotic-pumps-delivery-tract-tracers-to-study-brain[href=https://www.jove.com/v/52932/implantation-miniosmotic-pumps-delivery-tract-tracers-to-study-brain] (Sanchez-Mendoza et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nTake a mini-osmotic pump and a flow moderator from Alzet mini-osmotic pump box and a catheter, a brain infusion cannula and a spacer disc from brain infusion kit box in the biosafety cabinet (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/494-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Preparation of mini-osmotic pump\n(A) Components of the mini-osmotic pump used in this protocol (including spacer disc, cannula and removable tab, catheter, flow moderator, and mini-osmotic pump).\n(B) The cannula, catheter, and flow moderator were assembled.\n(C and D) The assembly was filled with solution until a drop of solution escapes at the head and tail of the assembly.\n(E and F) The mini-osmotic pump was filled with solution until a drop of solution escapes from the pump body.\n(G) The flow moderator was connected with the filled osmotic pump.\n(H) Incubated the filled assembly with attached osmotic pump in the normal saline solution at 37°C for 24 h.\nInvert the brain infusion cannula with an aseptic forceps, add two drops of cyanoacrylate adhesive, and insert it into a spacer disc.",
    "Place the cannula on an upward plane in the biosafety cabinet and wait until the cyanoacrylate is fully dry.\nCut a catheter into 3 cm and carefully attach the catheter to the flow moderator (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nConnect the filling needle to a 1 mL syringe and withdraw additional remnant solution.\nFill the flow moderator and the catheter with the solution containing PTN (10 μg/mL in DPBS) or vehicle alone (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2D).\nCritical: Do not create bubbles which will impede the flow of the solution into the brain.\nSlowly fill the pump with the above solution until a drop of liquid out of the pump body (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nCritical: Notice the dark shadow in the pump indicating the solution level and stop filling when a bead of solution emerges from the pump body.\nCarefully insert the flow moderator into the pump (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E–2G).\nPlace the filled mini-osmotic pump into a 50 mL tube with normal saline solution at 37°C for 24 h (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H).\nCheck whether there are bubbles in the flow moderator and the catheter before implantation. If bubbles are observed, remove the cannula, refill the catheter, and reconnect the tube.\nImplantation of mini-osmotic pump\nTiming: 30 min to 1 h\nTake the mouse who has been grafted with the retroviruses and inject avertin solution (400 mg/kg) intraperitoneally.\nRefer to steps 2–10 and fix the mouse onto stereotactic apparatus.\nUse a scalpel to make a 1.5 cm incision to exposure the original two holes (the same holes with retroviral injection).\nUse sterile cotton swabs to gently clean the surface of the skull so that the holes are clearly visible.\nNote: Make sure that the skull is level before implantation (please refer to the steps 11–13).",
    "Select one hole which will be received the cannula, and the other will be considered as a control without treatment of mini-osmotic pump implantation.\nUse a hemostatic forceps to create a short subcutaneous tunnel from the scalp incision to scapula, which serves as a pocket for the mini-osmotic pump.\nNote: The pocket should be large enough to accommodate the pump and permit it move around, but not too large as the pump might slip down onto the flank of the animal.\nCarefully introduce the pump into the pocket and leave the cannula and the catheter outside (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/494-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Implantation of the mini-osmotic pump\n(A) The mouse was placed onto the stereotactic device with the fully constructed mini-osmotic pump next to it.\n(B) The pump were introduced into the back of the animal and only the cannula remains on the exterior.\n(C) The cannula were grafted into the left hole (−1.9 mm ventral to the surface of the skull).\n(D and E) The removable tab of the cannula was moved away.\n(F) The wound was stitched.\nCarefully add five drops of cyanoacrylate adhesive next to the needle in the cannula and attach the cannula into the holder.\nNote: Make sure that the cyanoacrylate adhesive is not adhered to the needle tip of the cannula and avoid the needle clogged.\nCarefully lower the cannula needle to reach the dentate gyrus, set depth/vertical to 1.9 mm (please refer to the steps 19–21 of retroviral injection).\nHold the cannula in position for 2 min until the cyanoacrylate is fully dry and the cannula is entirely attached in the skull (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).",
    "Alternatives: Cyanoacrylate adhesive can be replaced by dental cement. The powdered dental cement can be mixed with its acrylic solvent in a 50 mL centrifuge tube cap and carefully drip the mix into the skull to fix the cannula.\nNote: Adhesion of the cannula to the skull can be improve if the skull surface around the cannula site is clean and dry enough.\nCarefully cut the removable tab with a scissors (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D and 3E).\nClose the scalp incision with silk suture (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F).\nGently remove the ear bars and take the mouse from the stereotaxic instruments.\nPut the mouse in a new cage and keep it on a heating pad.\nNote: Do not put the mouse with those have still not been operated.\nMonitor the mouse until it wakes up and moves around on its own and do not leave the mouse unattended until the sternal recumbent is restored.\nReturn the mouse to the standard housing condition until the desired time stages.\nNote: At the desired time after implantation of mini-osmotic pump, the mouse is anesthetized and transcardially perfused with normal saline solution followed by PBS-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde for immunostaining (Tang et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Wang et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11])."
