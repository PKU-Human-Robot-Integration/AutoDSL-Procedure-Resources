    "The present protocol is approved by the human research ethics committee of the University of Nebraska Medical Center. The protocol follows the guidelines of the human research ethics committee of the same university.\n1. Insertion of the device\nNOTE: This procedure needs to be ideally performed in a fluoroscopy suite to ensure accurate placement of the device.\nPrepare the patient.\n\tNOTE: Any patient >18 years of age, male or female, are eligible for this therapy if anatomy is suitable for appropriate access and delivery of the device. Individuals <18 years old may also be considered for the device if anatomy is suitable.\n\t\nIdentify and expose the access site.\n\t\tNOTE: There are four options for inserting this cannula device. It can be placed via right IJ (preferred), left IJ, left subclavian, or right subclavian vein.\nUsing chlorohexidine-based or iodine-based preparation solution (see Table of Materials), thoroughly clean the access site and surrounding areas. Apply a sterile drape to establish a sterile field in a standard fashion.\nSelf-sterilize. Scrub, gown, and glove following the sterile technique.\nSterilize the ultrasound machine. Place a sterile ultrasound probe cover over the ultrasound transducer (see Table of Materials).\nUsing ultrasound guidance, identify venous access.\n\tNOTE: Exclude any obstructions to venous flow within the target vessel by scanning up and down the vessel with the ultrasound probe.\nUsing the modified Seldinger technique21, gain access to the vein.\n\t\nAnesthetize by injecting up to 10 mL of 1% lidocaine into the subcutaneous tissue at the access site.\nUnder ultrasound guidance, cannulate the vein using a 5 Fr micropuncture needle.\nUnder fluoroscopy or transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) guidance, insert a micropunture wire through the needle ~8-10 cm in the vein. Remove the needle, leaving the wire in place.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure to always hold onto the wire to prevent embolization.",
    "Enlarge the puncture site using a 10-blade, making a small 0.5 cm incision directly over the wire perpendicular to the wire.\n\t\tNOTE: Patients tend to bleed directly following this step. It is good to have the equipment readily available to prevent excess bleeding. Also, a 4 x 4 sterile gauze might be required to apply at the incision site to clear the excess blood.\nPlace a 5 Fr sheath over the wire. Remove the wire leaving the sheath in place.\nThen, put an 0.035\" wire through the 5 Fr sheath and upsize it to a 9 multi-lumen access catheter (MAC). Once upsized to the 9 MAC, remove the wire.\nAfter the sheath placement, float a Swan Ganz catheter in standard fashion through the 9 Fr MAC (see Table of Materials) using fluoroscopy or TEE guidance.\n\t\nAdvance a balloon-tipped catheter (see Table of Materials) through the sheath ~10-20 mm, and then inflate the balloon with 1-2 cc of air.\nUnder fluoroscopy, advance the inflated balloon-tipped catheter into the RA through the tricuspid valve and the main PA.\nInsert a 0.035-inch diameter stiff wire (see Table of Materials) through the balloon-tipped catheter into the right PA.\nAfter deflating the balloon-tipped catheter, remove the swan while leaving the stiff wire in place.\nSerially dilate the access site using sequentially larger dilators (Figure 3) by placing the dilators one by one over the stiff wire smallest to largest up to 26 Fr using the device dilators. If using a 31 Fr cannula, dilate up to 30 Fr.\n\t\nSimultaneously hold the wire at skin level and intermittently maintain pressure to prevent bleeding as appropriate with the left hand and navigate the dilators with the other hand.",
    "NOTE: This pRVAD does not come with a 30 Fr dilator. A 30 Fr Tracheal dilator (see Table of Materials) is substituted here. Also, note that each subsequent dilatation increases access site size, and therefore each step up in dilation may cause increased bleeding risk.\nAdminister intravenous (IV) unfractionated heparin boluses to achieve an activated clotting time (ACT) of ~250, depending on the patient's bleeding risk.\n\tNOTE: The ACT goal may need to be adjusted lower for patients with a higher bleeding risk (e.g., fresh sternotomy). The ACT goal listed above uses a Hemochron device (see Table of Materials). To achieve the recommended ACT goal, administer 70-100 units/kg of IV unfractionated heparin. In case the therapeutic ACT level is not achieved with the initial bolus, additional boluses may be administered based on the achieved ACT level, but exact dosing recommendations are not provided by the guidelines.\nOnce a therapeutic ACT is achieved, insert the pRVAD device.\n\t\nAdvance the device's introducer and cannula assembly over the guidewire.\n\t\tNOTE: The cannula size varies from patient to patient. Hence, the size of the cannula assembly depends on the cannula selected.\nBefore pushing the device through the skin over the wire, push the wire retrograde through the device until the wire is observed coming out of the distal tip.\nOnce the wire is observed and secured, advance the introducer cannula through the skin over the wire.\nAdvance the device past the tricuspid and pulmonary valves through the main PA and into the right PA.",
    "NOTE: Correct positioning is confirmed with echocardiography, transduction of intracardiac pressures on the PA catheter, and/or fluoroscopy. Deploying the device deep into the right PA and then pulling it back into the appropriate position just distal to the bifurcation is recommended to avoid deploying the cannula too shallow and preventing the device from prolapsing into the RV, which can be catastrophic. The device can also be deployed in the left PA but tends to have a smoother curve in the RPA.\nRemove the introducer and stiff wire when the device is in the desired location (Figure 4).\n\t\nWhile maintaining the device's position under visualization with fluoroscopy, first remove the introducer and then pull gently on the stiff wire till the entire wire is removed.\nClamp the cannula on the proximal and distal ports (Figure 2).\nReassess positioning of the cannula via TEE and/or fluoroscopy.\n\t\t​NOTE: Typically, the device is initially intentionally placed with the tip in the right PA, and then with the wire and introducer out, the device is gently retracted until the tip is just proximal to the PA bifurcation on TEE and fluoroscopic imaging and at least 3-4 cm past the pulmonic valve.\nSecure the device cannula in place.\n2. Connecting, activation, and maintenance of the device\nDe-air and connect the standard tubing provided in the device kit.\n\t\nEnsure the circuit is primed and de-aired before connecting the tubing.\nConnect the outflow tubing marked with a red stripe using fluid-to-fluid contact to the cannula port for return blood drainage (from the pump to the patient).\nConnect the pump inflow tubing marked with a blue stripe using a fluid-to-fluid contact to the cannula port for blood drainage (from the patient to the pump).\nRelease the clamps.\nTurn on the centrifugal pump starting at 5,500 revolutions per minute (RPM).",
    "Gradually increase the pump RPMs until the desired level of flow is achieved.\nRecheck positioning of the pump.\n\tNOTE: Verifying the positioning of the cannula tip may be facilitated at this stage, given color flow at the outlet ports on TEE.\nSecure the pump.\n\t\nSecure the pump using either the voyager vest (see Table of Materials) or the wrap (Figure 5) to maintain device stability and allow for patient comfort and ambulation.\nPerform maintenance of the device.\n\t\nMonitor the positioning of the device with daily chest radiographs. Monitor patient hemodynamics closely while the device is in to ensure adequate hemodynamic support.\nMonitor labs every 6 h, including complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, electrolytes, lactic acid, and centrally drawn mixed venous saturation.\n3. Removal of the device\nWean the device following the steps below.\n\t\nGradually turn down the device's speed while monitoring hemodynamic and cardiac function response.\n\t\tNOTE: Typically, this is performed while obtaining an echocardiogram turn-down study focusing on the cardiac function with lower flows on the device. Lactic acid, mixed venous saturation, and liver/renal function need to be monitored frequently. If worsening RV function or observed end-organ dysfunction by abnormal labs is observed at any point, the patient has failed the RV wean and should continue support.\nIf the RV function appears suitable for removing the device and the patient is oxygenating and ventilating well, wean the speed and remove the cannula.\n\t\nBefore removing the cannula, clamp the proximal and distal ports to prevent leakage of blood.\nRemove the cannula.\n\t\tNOTE: Once the cannula is retracted to where the atrial side ports are exposed, these sites will bleed, and therefore the cannula needs to be pulled smoothly but rapidly. A 2-0 figure-of-eight absorbable suture is placed through the skin or subcutaneous tissue for hemostasis at the entry site.",
