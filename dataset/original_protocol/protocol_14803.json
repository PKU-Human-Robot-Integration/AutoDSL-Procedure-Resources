    "According to the Austrian law, and the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare of the US public health service avian embryos are not considered as live vertebrate animals until hatching.The NIH Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare has provided written guidance in this area (http://www.grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/references/ilar91.htm and NIH Publication No.: 06-4515).\n1. Cell Culture and Lentiviral Transfection\nCulture MM cell lines OPM-2, RPMI-8226 and human mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow in RPMI1640 medium, supplemented with 10% bovine fetal calf serum and 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 2 mM glutamine in the presence of 5% CO2 at 37°C.\nTransfect 5 x 106 HEK 293FT cells with viral packaging mix (9 µg) DNA and 3 µg pLenti6/V5 dest eGFP vector by the use of 30 µl liposomal transfection reagent and transfection medium (10 ml). Remove transfection medium after 12 h and add 10 ml DMEM medium with 10% bovine calf serum and 1% non-essential amino acids (NEAA).\nAfter 5 days, collect supernatants of HEK293FT cells after centrifugation of swimming cells (1,000 x g, 5min). Determine viral titer by real time PCR as described elsewhere 28.\nTransfect 1 x 106 MM cells with eGFP lentiviral particles (1 x 105 particles) in a 24 well plate in complete growth medium. After 3 days, start selection process by adding 2 µg/ml blasticidin to the culture medium. For the commercially available eGFP lentivirus, use 500 µg/ml neomycin.\nAfter 2 weeks of selection, clusters of eGFP expressing MM cells will appear; collect cells by centrifugation (1,000 x g, 5 min) and expand them as OPM-2eGFP and RPMI-8226eGFP sublines for experiments (section 2 and 3).\n2. 3D-Multiple Myeloma Spheroid Model\nChill collagen type-I solution and 10 x DMEM on ice.",
    "Mix 1/10 Volume of 10 x DMEM medium into collagen matrix; add NaOH (0.2 N) to neutralize acidic collagen solution to a pH value of 7.4; store collagen/medium solution on ice.\nMix transgenic MM cell lines (OPM-2eGFP or RPMI-8226 eGFP; 250,000 per spheroid,) with human mesenchymal cells (50,000 cells/ spheroid, i.e., 30 µl drop).\nCentrifuge cell mixture in 15 ml tubes (1000 x g, 5min), add cold prepared collagen mixture (1mL) to the cell pellet and mix well (with 1,000 µl tip).\nImmediately pipette 30 µl of the collagen/cell mixture (with 100 µl tip) in a 24 well plate on sterile paraffin film and allow cell/collagen mixture to polymerize for 30 min at 37°C (see Figure 1A).\nOverlay MM spheroids with 1mL culture medium containing 1, 10 and 100 nM bortezomib (see Figure 1B).\nAfter 72 hr of incubation at 37°C, document spheroids by fluorescence stereomicroscopy (see Figure 1C).\nTransfer each spheroid by the use of forceps with wide flat jaws in a reaction tube for measurement of GFP (see Figure 1D).\n3. 3D Multiple Myeloma Xenograft Model in the CAM\nIncubate chicken eggs in a special incubator for avian eggs at 37°C and 70% humidity for three days.\nThereafter, open eggs and transfer embryos to sterilized with ethanol, square, 10-cm plastic weighing boats with cell culture plate lid and incubate “ex ovo” for further six days, so that the CAM is able to develop (see Figure 2A).\nChill collagen type-I solution and 10 x DMEM on ice, mix 1/10 Volume of 10 x DMEM medium into collagen matrix, Add NaOH (0.2 N) to neutralize acidic collagen solution to a pH value of 7.4; store collagen/medium solution on ice.\nMix transgenic MM cell lines (OPM-2eGFP or RPMI-8226eGFP; 250,000 per spheroid,) with human mesenchymal cells (50,000 cells/ spheroid).",
    "Centrifuge cells in 15 ml tubes (1,000 x g, 5min; for each test compound 1 vial), add 1mL cold prepared collagen mixture with drug (at desired working concentration) to the cell pellet and mix well (with 1,000 µl tip).\nPlace collagen drops (30 µl each) on parafilm in a 6 well pate for 30 min to allow polymerization of the extracellular matrix at 37°C.\nTransfer “onplants” from step 3.6 with the use of forceps to the untreated surface of the CAM (2 cm away from embryo) of 9-day-old chicken embryos (4 onplants for each chicken embryo, see Figure 2B)\nAfter 5 days of in vivo growth in an egg incubator at 37°C and 70% humidity, document xenografts by fluorescence stereomicroscopy (see Figure 2C). Euthanize chicken embryos by hypothermia at 4°C in the fridge for 5h.\nRemove xenografts with subjacent CAM tissue by an ophthalmic scissor and forceps with wide flat jaws. Use them for measurement of GFP (section 4, see Figure 2D) or for immunohistochemical analysis of blood vessels and/or invading tumor cells (section 5).\n4. Quantification of eGFP Protein by ELISA\nTransfer each MM spheroid or excised xenograft into 0.5 ml RIPA Buffer containing 200 µg/ml protease inhibitors.\nHomogenize spheroid/xenograft with a tissue homogenizer on ice.\nPerform three freezing/thawing-cycles in liquid nitrogen and 37°C water bath.\nCentrifuge homogenate at 4°C for 20 min (12,000 g) and store supernatants.\nDilute samples 1:20 in assay buffer (200 µl) of the ELISA kit. Measure GFP-levels by a commercial GFP ELISA Kit using biotinylated anti-GFP antibodies, according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\n5. Immunohistochemical Analysis of Blood Vessels and Invading Tumor Cells\nFix excised xenografts with CAM area in 4% paraformaldehyde O/N at 4°C.",
    "Place fixed xenografts into embedding cassettes and transfer them into a tissue embedding station with an increasing graded alcohol series (50%, 70%, 80%, 95% ethanol, xylol and paraffin; each step 60 min).\nSection xenografts (5 µm) by the use of a benchtop rotary microtome. Bake paraffin sections on glass slides O/N at 56°C.\nDeparaffinize sections by a decreasing graded alcohol series to double-distilled water (xylol, 95%, 80%, 70%, 50% ethanol, double-distilled water; each step 10 min).\nPerform antigen retrieval in a water bath (95°C, 20 min) with an antigen retrieval solution (citrate- buffer; pH 7.0; volume 100 µl).\nBlock endogenous peroxidase activity with 100 µl 3% H2O2/methanol for 30 min.\nBlock sections in PBS containing 10% fetal calf serum for 45 min (volume 100 µl).\nStain for 1 hr with 100 µl of primary antibody (1µg/ml) diluted in PBS containing 1% fetal calf serum at RT.\nAfter washing 3-times in PBS, incubate for 1h with biotinylated secondary antibody (0.1 µg/ml) in PBS containing 1% fetal calf serum at RT.\nAfter washing 3-times in PBS perform color reaction by the avidin/biotin-complex (ABC) and the diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate solution according to manufacturer’s instructions.\n5.11. Stop reaction by transferring sections to double-distilled water, counterstain with hematoxylin and mount sections with a synthetic mounting medium.\nSubscription Required.
