    "1. Prediction of Cdk1-specific Phosphorylation Sites from the Protein Sequence\nBefore beginning the kinase assay, analyze the protein sequence for predicted Cdk1-specific phosphorylation sites and search the literature for experimentally established phosphorylation sites with unknown kinase specificity. Use the following tools, databases, and references that are summarized.\n\t\nUse the iGPS 3.0 software36,37 (http://gps.biocuckoo.org/online_full.php) to predict Cdk1-specific phosphorylation sites in the target protein sequence. Use the link here for a comprehensive prediction that includes annotations of secondary structure and surface accessibility.\nIn the software, enter the protein sequence in FASTA format. For kinase specificity, check Serine/Threonine kinase, CMGC, CDK, CDC2, CDK1, and uncheck all other specificities. Select medium as the threshold and click the Submit button.\nCompare the resulting predicted sites with the Cdk1 consensus phosphorylation site (Ser/Thr-Pro-X-Lys/Arg).\nImportantly, check the predicted site for the proline next to the phosphorylated residue (some Cdk1 substrates are phosphorylated at a minimal site (Ser/Thr-Pro)6,12). In addition, check for basic residues, that are preferred in the +2 or +3 positions, with most Cdk1-specific phosphorylation sites containing a Lys or Arg at the +3 position6,12.\nAlso check that the site is accessible for recognition, as the presence of a full consensus site is not sufficient for Cdk1 phosphorylation.\n\t\nInspect the surface accessibility and secondary structure prediction annotation in the iGPS output, which states whether the site is predicted to be accessible; N- and C-termini of proteins are in many cases flexible and accessible for phosphorylation.\nIf an X-ray structure of the target protein is available, check accessibility of putative phosphorylation sites by inspecting their location in the structure.\nSearch the literature for experimentally established phosphorylation sites with unknown kinase specificity using the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database38 (http://www.uniprot.org).",
    "Enter the name of the protein in the search box and click the Search button. Select the correct sequence entry. Phosphorylation sites are annotated and referenced in the amino acid modifications section.\nSearch for proteomics studies of mitotic extracts of human cell lines7,39,40, which are particularly useful because Cdk1 becomes active in the G2 phase of the cell cycle.\nIdentify bipartite cNLS by NLSmapper (optional).\n\tNOTE: For proteins that shuttle between the cytosol and the nucleus, a common mechanism for regulation of cellular localization is the phosphorylation of a bipartite cNLS in the -1 position of the major motif by Cdk1. The phosphorylation abolishes nuclear localization in the G2 phase10,41,42,43.\n\t\nFor such shuttling proteins, identify the cNLS in the protein sequence by NLSmapper43 (http://nls-mapper.iab.keio.ac.jp/cgi-bin/NLS_Mapper_form.cgi). Paste the protein sequence as text in the sequence box, select a cut-off score of 5.0, and elect to search for the NLS in the entire region. Click the Predict NLS button.\nCompare the resulting predicted cNLS against the consensus sequence of a bipartite cNLS, which consists of the minor motif (Lys-Arg), a linker of at least 10 residues, and the major motif (Lys-Lys/Arg-X-Lys/Arg), where X is any residue that is not negatively charged.\nCheck if the predicted Cdk1 phosphorylation site (*) is located adjacent to the major motif in the -1 position of the linker: Ser/Thr*-Pro/X-X-Lys-Lys/Arg-X-Lys/Arg.\n\t\tNOTE: The phosphorylation of a bipartite cNLS in the -1 position by Cdk1 was established as a regulatory mechanism for cellular localization for several shuttling proteins10,41,42,43.\n2. Expression of Recombinant Proteins in Escherichia Coli \nUse the expression plasmids from steps 2.1.1-2.1.2 for the expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli.",
    "To create the human CENP-F (residues 2,987 - 3,065) expression construct, generate inserts by amplifying DNA fragments by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from a full-length CENP-F construct (GenBank accession: U19769.1). Use the following primers: AGTCGGGGATCCCAGCAATCTAAACAAGATTCCCG and AGTCGGCTCGAGTCATTATTCTGCAGGGTGAATACCACTCATG.\n\t\tNOTE: The full-length human CENP-F plasmid was generously provided by Dr. X. Zhu, Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.\n\t\t\nClone the insert into the pGEX6p1 vector with the BamHI and XhoI restriction sites. Use this plasmid to express N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of CENP-F (residues 2,987-3,065).\n\t\t\tNOTE: The GST-tag can be cleaved off by the PreScission protease (henceforth referred to as PS protease).\nFor the human karyopherin α expression construct, generate inserts by amplifying DNA fragments by PCR from a full-length karyopherin α2 cDNA template (sequence accession NM_002264.3; primers: GCACTACATATGTCCACCAACGAGAATGCTAATA and TCACGCCTCGAGTTATCAAAAGTTAAAGGTCCCAGGAGCC).\n\t\tNOTE: Due to the similarity of the isoforms, this karyopherin α2 construct is referred to in the subsequent text as karyopherin α.\n\t\t\nClone the insert into the pET28a-pres vector with the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This is a modified pET28a vector in which the sequence encoding for the thrombin cleavage site was replaced by a sequence that encodes for a PS protease cleavage site. Use this plasmid to express a fusion protein of karyopherin α with an N-terminal His6-tag, where the His6-tag can be cleaved off by PS protease.\nTo create point mutations of a target protein, perform site-directed mutagenesis with a kit.\nExpress the recombinant proteins in E. coli for subsequent purification.\n\t\nMake the following stocks: 50 mg/mL kanamycin (1:1,000 stock solution), 35 mg/mL chloramphenicol in 70% Ethanol (1:1,000), 100 mg/mL ampicillin (1:1,000), and 1 M isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; 1:5,000).\nSterile filter the stocks and store at -20 °C. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles for IPTG.",
    "Transform 1 µL of expression plasmid into 50 µL of competent cells of the E. coli Rosetta 2(DE3)pLysS strain, according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nPlate the culture on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar with chloramphenicol (35 µg/mL LB) and ampicillin (100 µg/mL LB) for the CENP-F construct, or chloramphenicol and kanamycin (50 µg/mL culture) for the karyopherin α construct. Incubate the plates for 12-20 h at 37 °C.\nPick a single colony and inoculate 50 mL of LB supplemented with antibiotics (see step 2.3.4). Incubate the preculture while shaking at 160-180 rpm for 12-20 h at 37 °C.\nPrepare 1 L of LB medium in a 2,800 mL baffled Fernbach flask. Make two flasks for each preculture and autoclave them. To allow aeration, do not fill the flasks to more than two thirds the flask volume. Erlenmeyer flasks can be used as well.\nAdd antibiotics (step 2.3.4) and 10 mL of a sterile-filtered 40% (w/v) glucose solution per 1 L of cooled LB. Add 20 mL of preculture per 1 L of LB medium.\n\t\tNOTE: The absorbance at 600 nm of a 1:10 dilution of the preculture should be between 0.15-0.2.\nIncubate the flasks while shaking at 160-180 rpm at 37 °C. Measure the absorbance at 600 nm of the bacteria culture regularly. If the absorbance reaches 0.5-0.6, induce protein expression by adding 0.2 mM IPTG (200 µL of 1 M stock per 1 L of LB medium).\n\t\tNOTE: It is important that cells are induced at the correct absorbance. Usually it takes 3-4 h to reach this stage.",
    "Incubate the flasks while shaking for 3 h at 37 °C. Harvest the cells by centrifugation (15 min, 4,100 x g, 4 °C, swing-out rotor). Discard the supernatant. Resuspend the cell pellets in 20 mL GST-binding buffer (CENP-F) or His6-binding buffer (karyopherin α) per 1 L of culture. Store the cells at -80 °C.\n\t\t\nPrepare the GST-binding buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0 at 25 °C, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5 mM EDTA) and His6-binding buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0 at 25 °C, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM Imidazole pH 8.0, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol (BME)) in advance.\n3. Purification of Recombinant Protein by Glutathione-affinity Chromatography and Gel Filtration\nMake the following stocks: 1 M DTT (1:1,000 stock, sterile filtered with 0.2 µM pore size, and degassed); 250 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF; 1:1,000 stock in dimethylsulfoxide). Store at -20 °C. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.\nMake the following buffers and cool them to 4 °C.\n\t\nPrepare the GST-binding buffer using 10 mM Tris pH 8.0 at 25 °C, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EDTA.\nPrepare the GST-elution buffer using 10 mM reduced glutathione (0.15 g/50 mL) dissolved in a buffer of 50 mM Tris pH 8.0 at 25 °C, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT. Confirm that the pH of the final buffer is 8.0 and use on the same day it was made.\nPrepare the Gel-filtration buffer using 20 mM Tris pH 7.5 at 25 °C, 60 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT. Sterile filter the buffer with a bottle-top filter (0.2 µM pore size). Degas the buffer while stirring under vacuum (-6 psi) for 15 min.\nAdd DTT to all above buffers on the day of use.",
    "Thaw the cells from Section 2 that contain the CENP-F construct. Adjust the volume to 40 mL with the GST-binding buffer. Add 1 mM DTT, 0.25 mM PMSF, 0.5 mM EDTA (0.5 M stock solution, pH 8.0), 7 mg benzamidine hydrochloride (1 mM), and 40 mg D/L methionine.\n\tNOTE: To reduce proteolytic degradation, perform all steps at 4 °C, preferably in a cold room, unless otherwise noted. Keep cells, lysates, and purified protein fractions on ice at all times, and add protease inhibitors. To prevent oxidation of cysteine and methionine residues, add reductants such as DTT and methionine on the day of the experiment. To reduce proteolytic degradation, work through the steps quickly.\nLyse the cells in a sonicator as follows. Fill a glass beaker with the lysate and immerse it in an ice water bath. Sonicate the culture (1 min 40 s, at 100 W (50%) output/amplitude, with 10 s pulses and 10 s rest cycles).Add 250 µM PMSF after sonication. Inspect the cell lysate, which should look more transparent and no longer be viscous.\nClear the lysate by centrifuging at 12,000-40,000 x g, 25 min, 4 °C. Use round-bottom centrifuge tubes and a fixed angle rotor.\nPerform equilibration by adding 2 mL of glutathione agarose 1:1 slurry to a disposable chromatography column. The resulting column will have a volume of 1 mL. Wash the column with 25 mL of ultrapure water and 25 mL of GST-binding buffer.\nPerform binding as follows. Working in a cold room or cold box, decant the lysate from the pellets. Filter the lysate (0.2 µm pore size) and pour it onto the plugged column. Cap the column and incubate it while gently nutating for 30 min at 4 °C.",
    "To wash the column, put it on a rack, let the resin settle, and collect the flow through. Wash the column twice with 25 mL of GST-binding buffer.\nElute by proteolytic cleavage.\nPlug the column. Add 400 µL of GST-binding buffer and 250 µL of PS protease (2 mg/mL stock with an activity of 1,000 U/mg, either purified in the lab or purchased; see Table of Materials).\nCap the column and gently swirl to resuspend the resin in the buffer. Incubate the columns for 16-20 h at 4 °C. Then add 4 mL of GST-binding buffer to elute the proteolytically cleaved CENP-F fragment from the column.\nGlutathione elution\nPlug the column, add 4 mL of GST-elution buffer (4 column volumes), and incubate for 10 min to elute the bound GST-tag. Collect the eluate. Regenerate the columns before re-use as described by the manufacturer.\nAnalyze the PS protease elution fraction and the glutathione elution fraction by SDS-PAGE on 16% acrylamide gels. Perform electrophoresis at 25 V/cm for 45 min. Stain the gels by Coomassie Blue. The PS protease fraction will contain the purified CENP-F fragment, whereas the glutathione fraction will contain the cleaved GST-tag. Inspect the gel to assess proteolytic cleavage efficiency.\nConcentrate the PS protease eluate to 0.5 mL using centrifugal filter units with a 3 kDa molecular weight cutoff (see Table of Materials). Add the eluate in the upper compartment of the filter, and centrifuge it in 10-15 min increments at 4,100 x g, 4 °C (swing-out rotor) to concentrate the sample. Mix by pipetting after each increment.\nConnect a suitable gel filtration column (see Table of Materials for purchasing information) to a fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system, and equilibrate it with 1 column volume of gel filtration buffer.",
    "Centrifuge the concentrated CENP-F fragment in a microcentrifuge (20 min, 21,700 x g, 4 °C). Inject the sample on the column and elute it with 1 column volume of gel filtration buffer. Collect 0.6 mL fractions.\n\tNOTE: The gel filtration buffer is optimized for compatibility with the subsequent kinase assay. Test if the target protein is stable in this buffer. If it is not stable, try adding more sodium chloride.\nAnalyze the peak fractions by SDS-PAGE (step 3.11). Pool the peak fractions that contain pure CENP-F fragments. Concentrate the purified CENP-F fragments to 3.3 mg/mL (step 3.12). Analyze the purified CENP-F fragments by SDS-PAGE (step 3.11).\nProtein concentration determination\nDilute the sample 1:100 in ultrapure water and place it in a quartz micro-cuvette. Record spectra at a wavelength range of 220-300 nm in a spectrophotometer.\n\t\tNOTE: The protein concentration c (mg/mL) is derived from the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57674/57674eq1.jpg\nMake 50 µL aliquots of the purified protein in 0.5 mL microtubes and flash-freeze them in liquid nitrogen. Store the aliquots at -80 °C.\n4. Purification of Recombinant Protein by Ni-NTA Affinity Chromatography\nMake the following buffers and cool to 4 °C.\n\t\nPrepare the His6-binding buffer using 10 mM Tris pH 8.0 at 25 °C, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM Imidazole pH 8.0, 5 mM BME. Add BME to all buffers on the day of use.\nPrepare the His6-wash buffer in the same manner as the His6-binding buffer but using 20 mM Imidazole.\nPrepare the His6-elution buffer in the same manner as the binding buffer but using 150 mM Imidazole.\nThaw the cells from Section 2 that contain the karyopherin α construct and adjust the volume to 40 mL with the His6-binding buffer. Add 5 mM BME, 0.250 mM PMSF, 7 mg benzamidine hydrochloride (1 mM), and 40 mg D/L methionine.",
    "Proceed as described in steps 3.4-3.8 with the following variations: Use His6-binding buffer instead of GST-binding buffer for all steps. Instead of glutathione agarose, use 4 mL of the Nickel affinity gel (see Table of Materials) to make the column, which will have a column volume of 2 mL.\n\t\tNOTE: Nickel affinity columns are incompatible with DTT and EDTA. Instead of the Nickel affinity gel, Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) agarose can be used, if the imidazole concentration in the elution buffer is increased to 250 mM (see Table of Materials).\nWash the columns with 8 mL of His6-wash buffer.\nElute the karyopherin α with 12 mL of His6-elution buffer and analyze eluate by SDS-PAGE (step 3.11).\nAdd 250 µL of PS protease (step 3.9) to the eluate and incubate for 16-20 h at 4 °C. In the meantime, dialyze the eluate twice against 1 L of His6-binding buffer for 2-20 h, using a dialysis membrane with a 6-8 kDa molecular weight cutoff.\nRegenerate the Nickel affinity gel column as described by the manufacturer. Equilibrate the column with 25 mL of His6-binding buffer. Add the dialyzed protein to the column and perform the binding step as described in step 3.7.\nCollect the flow through, which contains the purified karyopherin α (with the His6-tag cleaved off), and elute the remaining protein with an additional 4 mL of His6-binding buffer. Pool these fractions. Then elute the columns with 12 mL of His6-elution buffer. This fraction contains impurities.\nAnalyze the uncleaved and cleaved karyopherin α from steps 4.4-4.5 and the two elution fractions from this step by SDS-PAGE (step 3.11) to evaluate the efficiency of His6-tag cleavage and purity.\nConcentrate the karyopherin α to 8 mg/mL and flash-freeze in liquid nitrogen (steps 3.15-3.17).\n5. In Vitro Kinase Assay with Cdk1/Cyclin B\nIn vitro kinase assay",
    "NOTE: Upon arrival of the kinase, make small aliquots, flash-freeze them in liquid nitrogen and store them at -80 °C. Use within 6 months. While the molecular weight is 34 kDa for Cdk1 and 48 kDa for cyclin B, the apparent molecular weight of cyclin B on SDS-PAGE is about 60 kDa.\n\t\nPrepare the 10x PK buffer (supplied with the kinase) using 0.5 M Tris-HCl, 0.1 M MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM DTT, 0.1% Brij 35, pH 7.5 at 25 °C.\nPrepare the 10x ATP stock: Make a solution of 4 mM ATP in 1x PK buffer, and check the final pH of the stock. Store in small aliquots at -20 °C and avoid freeze-thaw cycles.\nMix 40 µL of CENP-F fragment (at a concentration of 3.3 mg/mL, or 400 µM), 6 µL 10x PK buffer, 3 µL ultrapure water, 6 µL ATP 10x stock, and 5 µL human Cdk1/cyclin B (1 µg, 100 U) in a 0.5 mL microtube.\n\t\tNOTE: The CENP-F fragment has a molar mass of 8.6 kDa and four Cdk1-specific phosphorylation sites. For a new substrate, adjust the kinase concentration in the assay according to the molar concentration of the protein and according to the number of phosphorylation sites. The activity of the human recombinant Cdk1/cyclin B stock is 20,000 U/mL, and the specific activity is 1,000,000 U/mg. 1 U is defined as the amount of Cdk1/cyclin B required to catalyze the transfer of 1 pmol of phosphate to Cdk1 peptide substrate PKTPKKAKKL-NH2 (50 µM) in 1 min at 30 °C (see Table of Materials).\nPrepare a control reaction without Cdk1/cyclin B. Incubate the reactions in a water bath for 1-16 h at 30 °C.",
    "Analyze 2.5 µL of the kinase assay reaction and 2.5 µL of the control by SDS-PAGE (step 3.11), using a gel with 16% acrylamide. To increase the resolution, extend the running time.\nAdd an equal volume of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride solution to the remaining kinase assay reaction (and to the control). The final guanidine hydrochloride concentration will be 3 M. Analyze these samples by mass spectrometry (Section 6) to identify the phosphorylation sites or send the samples to a mass spectrometry facility for analysis, and then perform function verification (Section 7).\n\tNOTE: For the subsequent mass spectrometry analysis, it is very important that the phosphorylation efficiency of the individual sites is as high as possible, preferably 100%, as otherwise the phosphorylation sites cannot be mapped. To greatly enhance phosphorylation efficiencies, add larger amounts of Cdk1/cyclin B and increase the incubation time to 16 h. The concentration of ATP can also be doubled.\nFor troubleshooting, perform an in vitro kinase assay of CENP-F (residues 2,987-3,065) as a positive control. Use fresh batches of Cdk1/cyclin B with high activities.\n6. Identification of Cdk1-specific Phosphorylation Sites by Mass Spectrometry\nTo denature and desalt the protein samples, perform microbore reverse phase liquid chromatography with a PLRP300 column.\nTo obtain the number of phosphorylation sites in the CENP-F fragment, analyze the intact in vitro phosphorylated CENP-F 84-mer by electrospray ionization ion trap mass spectrometry (ESI-ITMS)44,45.\nTo assess the phosphoamino acid site location of CENP-F, prepare the trypsin digests of the in vitro phosphorylated CENP-F protein samples. Desalt the trypsin digests with desalting pipet tips.\nAnalyze the tryptic digests of CENP-F by electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FTICR MS). Perform analysis on an ESI-FTICR mass spectrometer with an accumulation time of 169 µs.",
    "NOTE: The accuracy of masses determined by ESI-FTICR MS is within 0.005 amu. To quantify the ratio of each phosphorylated species respective to the total protein amount, determine the peak heights of the mass spectra.\n7. Functional Verification: Testing the Effects of Phosphomimetic Mutations on Protein-protein Interactions by Analytical Size Exclusion Chromatography\nNOTE: For functional verification of the identified Cdk1-specific phosphorylation sites, phosphomimetic mutants of CENP-F fragments were created by replacing the identified phosphorylation sites with aspartates. The negative charge of aspartate mimics the effects of phosphorylation. A S3048D mutant of the CENP-F fragment (residues 2,987-3,065) was created.\nFor functional verification, compare the binding of wild-type and phosphomimetic CENP-F fragments to karyopherin α. Use an analytical gel filtration as the binding assay. For the analytical gel filtration, purify CENP-F fragments by glutathione affinity chromatography (steps 3.1-3.12), and skip the gel filtration step.\nConcentrate the protein to 5-6 mg/mL. Flash-freeze protein aliquots in liquid nitrogen (steps 3.15-3.17).\nMix the purified CENP-F fragments (0.1 mg, either wild-type or the S3048D variant) and purified karyopherin α (0.7 mg) in a 1:1 molar ratio. Adjust the sample volume to 200 µL with gel filtration buffer. Incubate the sample for 30 min on ice, filter sample (0.2 µm pore size), and clear the sample by centrifugation (25 min, 21,700 x g, 4 °C)\nSeparate the sample by size exclusion chromatography (steps 3.13-3.14). Use a gel filtration buffer consisting of 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM DTT. Perform the analytical gel filtration experiments under identical conditions for all samples.\nCalibrate the analytical gel filtration column with molecular weight standards of known molar mass as described by the manufacturer.\nAnalyze the elution fractions by 16% SDS-PAGE (step 3.11).\nSubscription Required.
