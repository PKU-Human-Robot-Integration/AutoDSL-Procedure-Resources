    "This protocol assumes readers are familiar with T. gondii parasite and host cell propagation. For standard reviews, see Roos et al. (1994) and Jacot et al. (2020).Parasite harvestInfect T175 flasks or 15-cm dishes with confluent HFFs with 2 × 107-5 × 107 RH tachyzoites each, which is equivalent to parasites from one fully lysed T12.5 flask, 40-48 h before the assay. Enough T175’s should be infected to harvest 4 × 108 parasites for the assay. The yield may vary depending on host cell age, parasite strain, and treatment; in our experience, 3-4 15-cm dishes are usually sufficient to achieve this number of parasites.When the parasites have fully lysed from the monolayer, scrape the flask and collect the media containing extracellular parasites. A fully lysed monolayer contains an abundance of extracellular parasites and few remaining attached host cells. Remove host cell debris by passing the media through a 3 µm filter into one 50 ml conical vial per flask or dish.Concentrate the parasite solution by centrifuging the conicals at 1,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature in a centrifuge with swinging bucket rotors. Discard the supernatant. Resuspend the parasite pellet in 1 ml of wash buffer (lysis buffer without detergents, inhibitors, or enzymes) and transfer the parasite suspension to a 1.5 ml protein low-bind tube.Create a 1:500 dilution of the parasite suspension and count using a hemocytometer.Centrifuge the parasites at 1,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant.Depending on the desired treatment, proceed to section (B) Lysate Temperature Range Experiment, (C) Parasite Temperature Range Experiment, (D) Lysate Concentration Range Experiment, or (E) Parasite Concentration Range Experiment.Lysate temperature range experimentParasite lysisResuspend the parasite suspension in 100 µl lysis buffer per 2 × 107 parasites (see lysis considerations in the Background).",

Centrifuge for approximately 3 s.Place the PCR tubes in the appropriate orientation on the thermal cycler, such that the tubes with lysate match the desired temperature.Note: The thermal cycler program should be started in advance so that the wells are at temperature when the tubes are added; the precise sequence depends on the temperature gradient that can be achieved by the user’s thermal cycler. We have used melting temperatures of 37°C, 41°C, 43°C, 47°C, 50°C, 53°C, 56°C, 59°C, 63°C, and 67°C split across two PCR strip tubes in 48-well thermal cyclers.

Allow the parasites to lyse on ice for at least 15 min.Proceed to the step described below, F. Separation of Soluble and Aggregated Protein.Separation of soluble and aggregated proteinsBelow, we describe the two separation methods we have used for isolation of soluble proteins. For more information, see Note 1.Ultracentrifugation methodTransfer the heat-challenged lysates (a volume of approximately 100 µl) to ultracentrifuge tubes pre-chilled on a bed of ice.Note: The minimum volume of these tubes is 100 µl. Using lower volumes risks unbalancing the centrifuge rotor. Load the tubes into a pre-chilled TLA-100 rotor in a benchtop ultracentrifuge (e.g., Beckman Ultra MAX) chilled to 4°C. The TLA-100 rotor can fit up to 20 tubes, which is enough for the two treatment conditions of a temperature-range experiment or two challenge temperatures of a concentration-range experiment. The tubes must be appropriately balanced to avoid damage to the rotor and ultracentrifuge.Centrifuge the samples at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C using an ultracentrifuge. To calculate the appropriate rpm, use the rotor radius specifications and an online calculator such as https://www.beckman.com/centrifuges/rotors/calculator[href=https://www.beckman.com/centrifuges/rotors/calculator].",
    "Gently remove the rotor, taking care not to disturb the tubes, and immediately transfer the tubes to ice. If available, work in a cold room.Remove the top ~80% by volume of the supernatant and transfer to a pre-chilled protein low-bind tube. It is critical not to disrupt the pellet, which contains aggregated proteins and the membranous fraction.Proceed to the next section, F. Protein Cleanup and digestion with the SP3 protocol. Filter plate methodPre-wet the filter plate with 100 µl of 1× lysis buffer (with compound/treatment, if applicable). Place the filter plate on top of a 96-well plate. Centrifuge at 500 × g in a swinging-bucket centrifuge for 5 min, until the solution passes through the filter and into the 96-well plate. Discard the solution.Place the filter plate over a clean protein low-bind or polypropylene 96-well plate. Transfer the heat challenged lysates (~100 µl) to the equilibrated filter plate and centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C to separate the soluble protein from aggregates. Soluble proteins pass through the filter into the 96-well plate.Transfer the soluble fraction from the 96-well plate to protein low-bind tubes. The volume of the soluble protein solution is reduced relative to the input volume and should be measured prior to the next step, G. Protein Cleanup and Digestion.Protein cleanup and digestion with the SP3 protocolQuantify protein abundanceDetermine the protein concentration in the reference sample (37°C for temperature-range experiments and the lowest compound concentration for concentration-range experiments) using a protein quantification assay, e.g., the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Diluent solutions should contain the compound of interest or vehicle, if applicable, as it may substantially alter absorbance readings.",
    "The amount of protein determined in this step will be used to calculate the amount of SP3 beads to use for sample cleanup and trypsin to add for digestion. We typically quantify 20-60 µg of soluble protein in the reference sample. The following steps assume a yield of 50 µg in the reference sample; adjust volumes accordingly for lower amounts of protein.Transfer a volume corresponding to 50 µg of protein in the reference sample to a new protein low-bind tube. Transfer the same volume of the remaining samples to protein low-bind tubes as well. Raise the volume to 100 µl with lysis buffer.Reduce cysteinesAdd 0.5 µl of a 1 M TCEP solution to each sample. The concentration of TCEP is now 5 mM.Incubate the samples at 55°C for 10 min, e.g., on a heat block or thermomixer.Alkylate cysteinesRemove the tubes from 55°C and allow them to cool to room temperature. Add 7.54 µl of a 200 mM MMTS stock solution to bring the concentration to 15 mM. Allow the reaction to occur for 10 min at room temperature. Note: alternative protocols alkylate with iodoacetamide (IAA) in the dark. We prefer MMTS for in-solution digests due to its rapid reaction rate, stability, and lower non-specific alkylation (Müller and Winter, 2017), which can increase the number of peptide identifications following MS analysis. The choice of alkylating agent will determine search modification on cysteine, i.e., methylthio (+45.988 Da) for MMTS or carbamidomethyl (+57.021 Da) for IAA.Clean up samples using the SP3 protocol (Hughes et al., 2019). For more information, see Note 2.Prepare enough hydrophobic and hydrophilic Sera-Mag beads at 50 µg/µl for a 1:10 bead/protein (wt/wt) ratio relative to the reference sample. For example, to process 10 samples with a 50 µg reference sample, prepare 5 mg of beads.In a 1.",
    "5 ml tube, combine 50 µl of the 50 mg/ml hydrophobic beads with 50 µl of the 50 mg/ml hydrophilic beads.Place the beads on a magnetic rack and allow them to separate. Use a P200 pipette to remove and discard the supernatant.Wash the beads in 100 µl MS-grade water. Place the beads on a magnetic rack and again discard the supernatant.Resuspend the beads in 100 µl of MS-grade water for a final concentration of 50 µg/µl.Add 10 µl of 50 µg/µl beads to each sample. The bead/protein (wt/wt) ratio is now at least 10:1.Bind the proteins to the beads by adding a 4× volume of 100% HPLC-grade ethanol. For example, to the combined volume of 100 µl sample with 0.5 µl TCEP, 7.54 µl MMTS, and 10 µl Sera-Mag beads, add 472 µl 100% ethanol. Note: the protein solution is now 80% ethanol by volume. We found this proportion to be optimal for binding of T. gondii proteins to the Sera-Mag beads.Allow the proteins to aggregate with the beads by placing the tubes in a thermomixer and shaking at 1,000 rpm at 24°C for at least 10 min. The beads should “clump” upon binding protein.Place the tubes on a magnetic rack and allow the beads to separate, which takes approximately 30 s. Discard the supernatant into a waste stream that is appropriate for 80% ethanol.Wash the beads three times with 180 µl 80% ethanol, which can be prepared by diluting HPLC-grade ethanol with HPLC-grade water. Each time, allow the beads to magnetically separate from the solution for 30 s and dispose of the supernatant into an appropriate waste stream.Note: In the final rinse, remove as much of the ethanol wash solution as possible to minimize carryover during the enzymatic digestion step.",
    "We remove nearly all of the liquid by centrifuging the beads at 16,000 × g for 30 s and double-stacking a P200 and P10 tip to remove the supernatant. Digest proteins into peptidesPrepare a trypsin digest solution in 50 mM TEAB at a 1:50 (wt/wt) protein:trypsin ratio. Prepare enough stock solution for the number of samples to be processed, e.g., 20 samples for a temperature range experiment with a control and treatment condition and with 10 melting temperatures each.Add 35 µl of digest solution to each tube. Gently move the beads into the liquid with the tip of a pipette, but avoid pipetting the beads, as they are sticky.Place the tubes in a thermo mixer warmed to 37°C and shake at 1,000 rpm overnight (16-18 h).Centrifuge the tubes at 16,000 × g for 1 min at room temperature to pellet the beads and collect evaporated liquid.Place the tubes on a magnetic rack and allow the beads to separate for 30 s. Transfer the aqueous supernatant, which contains the digested peptides, to a new protein low-bind tube.After the peptides have been eluted, samples can be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and dried in a lyophilizer with a condenser temperature of -80°C and chamber pressure of approximately 0 mbar. The peptides are typically lyophilized to a powder in four hours or fewer. The lyophilized peptides can be stored at -80°C for several months.Tandem mass tag labelingSample multiplexing is performed with isobaric mass tags, which are commercially available in 10-plex and 16-plex format (Werner et al., 2014; Li et al., 2020). We keep working stocks of TMT 10-plex reagents at concentrations of 6.66 µg/µl (100 µg per 15 µl) in acetonitrile at -80°C for 3-6 months. We perform labeling at 2:1 (wt/wt) TMT:peptide (Zecha et al., 2019).",
    "A TMT labeling scheme should be selected in advance of labeling. Each temperature or concentration is labeled with one TMT channel. Two full 10-plex labeling reactions are performed per experiment: the 10 melting temperatures with vehicle and compound for temperature-range experiments or the 10 compound concentrations melted at two temperatures for concentration-range experiments. We have observed reporter ion interference when labeling sequentially (Brenes et al., 2019). Therefore, the labeling schemes shown in Figure 1 are recommended.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4207/bioprotoc-11-21-4207-g001.jpgFigure 1. Recommended TMT labeling strategy for temperature- and concentration-range experiments. t1/c1 refers to the lowest temperature or concentration in the experiment.Quantify peptide abundance with the Pierce fluorometric peptide assayBefore starting, quantify the number of peptides in the reference sample (37°C for temperature range experiments and the lowest compound concentration for concentration range experiments) using the Pierce Fluorometric Peptide Assay according to manufacturer’s instructions. If peptides have been lyophilized, resuspend in 35 µl 50 mM TEAB pH 8.5. A 1:20 dilution is often sufficient to place the sample within the range of the standard curve, e.g., 0.5 µl of sample + 9.5 µl water. For a standard whole-proteome TMT reaction, use 25-50 µg of peptides in 35 µl of 50 mM TEAB, diluting the sample as necessary. Use equivalent volumes and dilutions of the non-reference samples. The steps below are written for samples containing 50 µg of peptides in 35 µl.TMT labeling reactionEquilibrate the TMT reagents at room temperature for 3 min.Note: Record the reagent lot number and isotopic corrections for the batch. This information may be used to create a custom quantification method in Proteome Discoverer that corrects for isotopic impurities arising from natural carbon isotopes. Centrifuge the TMT reagents at 13,000 × g for 1 min and resuspend each vial in 120 µl of 100% MS-grade acetonitrile.",
    "Create 15 µl aliquots and store at -80°C for up to 6 months.Note: If resuspended TMT reagents will not be used for extended periods of time, lyophilize the reagents and store as a powder at -20°C. Add 15 µl of TMT reagent (100 µg) to the reference sample (50 µg protein in 35 µl 50 mM TEAB). If working with more or less peptide input, maintain the final vol/vol ratio of acetonitrile (TMT reagents) to aqueous buffer (TEAB buffer). For example, if labeling only 25 µg of peptides in 35 µl of TEAB, add 50 µg of TMT reagent in 7.5 µl and 7.5 µl of 100% acetonitrile to bring the final composition to 30% vol/vol acetonitrile.Centrifuge the tubes at 13,000 × g for 30 s to collect the liquid.Place the tubes in the thermomixer and shake at 400 rpm for 60 min at room temperature.Quench unreacted TMT reagent by adding 3.2 µl of 5% hydroxylamine per 50 µl reaction. Place the tubes in the ThermoMixer and shake at 400 rpm for 15 min at room temperature.Combine the samples in a 1.5 ml protein low-bind tube. Use the same pipette tip for all transfers to avoid losing peptides due to contact with new surfaces. The volume should now be approximately 530 µl.Flash-freeze the pooled sample in liquid nitrogen and lyophilize until dry. Note: sample volume may alternatively be reduced via vacuum centrifugation.Dry samples may be stored at -80°C for several months.Desalting and fractionationTMT-labeled samples should be fractionated prior to MS data acquisition to reduce isolation interference during MS analysis. We perform high pH reversed-phase peptide fractionation using HPLC (e.g., with Shimadzu LC-20AD; see Herneisen et al.",
    ", 2020) or the Pierce High pH Reversed-Phase Peptide Fractionation Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions, which we have found provide equivalent coverage of the T. gondii proteome and also function as a desalting step. We pool samples into eight fractions for LC-MS. The fractions can be lyophilized and stored at -80°C indefinitely.MS data acquisitionData acquisition methods are highly dependent on facilities. At a minimum, TMT-labeled samples should be acquired using sufficient resolution to resolve the reporter ions and with a long gradient to separate the complex peptide mixtures and reduce co-isolation interference. Here, we describe the data acquisition protocol for our Exploris 480 orbitrap with FAIMS Pro interface coupled to an Easy-nLC 1200 system.Sample resuspension and injectionResuspend each lyophilized fraction in Buffer A to an estimated concentration of 0.5-1 µg peptides/µl. We typically resuspend each sample in 25 µl. Ensure that the lyophilizate is completely solubilized; it may help to thoroughly wash the sides of the tube and collect the liquid by centrifuging at 16,000 × g for 1 min.Transfer each resuspended fraction to an autosampler tube. Once the samples are resuspended, they should be kept at 4°C.Inject 0.5-1 µg of peptides for MS analysis (typically 1-2 µl). Samples belonging to the same TMT labeling experiment can be injected sequentially (i.e., the set of fractions). We perform a blank injection between different TMT labeling experiments to reduce carryover.LC gradientOur samples are separated over a 90-min gradient described in Table 1. The gradient includes an optional 12-minute seesaw for column maintenance. Our LC system includes a commercial trapping column (Acclaim PepMap 100 75 µm × 2 µm nanoViper) connected to a 15 cm commercial analytical column (PepMap RSLC C18 3 µm, 100A, 75 µm × 15 cm).Table 1.
