    "1. Fabrication of the Microfluidic Device\nNOTE: The entire microfluidic device is fabricated using the soft lithography replica molding process13.\nFabrication of molds for the PDMS layers in the microfluidic device\nDesign the microfluidic channel patterns using commercially available illustration or drawing software. Submit the file to a company for high-resolution transparency photomask printing14.\nClean silicon wafers with acetone (≥99.5%), isopropyl alcohol (IPA; ≥99.9%), and buffered oxide etch (BOE; 6:1 NH4F.HF). Rinse with deionized (DI) water and dehydrate the wafer with a nitrogen gun.\nSpin coat approximate 20 g of negative tone photoresist, SU-8 2050, onto the wafers at 500 rpm for 15 sec and then 2,000 rpm for 30 sec.\n\t\t​NOTE: The spin coating condition should yield SU-8 2050 photoresist layers with a thickness of approximately 75 µm on the wafers after optical lithography.\nSoft bake the wafers on a 65 °C hotplate for 3 min and then at 95 °C for 9 min. After the soft bake, expose the wafers using a mask aligner with the designed transparency masks under UV light; the total exposure energy should be about 300 mJ/cm2. Post-exposure bake (PEB) the wafers at 65 °C for 2 min and then at 95 °C for 7 min.\nAfter the PEB, immerse the wafers in SU-8 developer with strong agitation or in an ultrasonic bath (37 kHz and 180 W effective ultrasonic power) for 7 min. Rinse the wafer with acetone and IPA to remove the residual SU-8.\nPlace the wafer and 100 µl of silane (1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyltrichlorosilane) into a 6 cm diameter Petri dish in a desiccator connected with a diaphragm vacuum pump for wafer surface silanization in order to prevent undesired bonding. Turn on the pump for 15 min, turn it off, and seal the desiccator with a vacuum for 30 min.",
    "Take the silanized wafers out of the desiccator and tape them to 15 cm diameter Petri dishes for the following soft lithography process:\nFabrication and assembly of PDMS layers\nPreparation of the PDMS pre-polymer\n\t\t\nMix PDMS monomer (base) and the curing agent at a 10:1 ratio (v/v). Degas the mixture in the desiccator setup for 60 min.\nFabrication of the PC-embedded top layer\n\t\t\nTransfer 2 g of the PDMS pre-polymer onto the mold with the top-layer fluidic channel patterns to make a thin layer of PDMS. Place the mold in the desiccator setup to degas the PDMS for 60 min.\nPlace the mold overnight in a 60 °C oven for PDMS curing. Make sure that the mold is on a horizontal plane.\nCool down the mold to room temperature.

Cut the device with a scalpel to an area of approximately 5.5 x 5 cm2, which can cover all channel patterns, and peel off the PDMS slab from the mold.\nPunch holes for inlets and outlets using a 2 mm-diameter biopsy punch. Store the fabricated top PDMS-PC layer away from ambient dust for later assembly.\nFabrication of the bottom PDMS layer",
    "Pour 11 g of the PDMS pre-polymer onto the mold for the bottom layer. Place the mold in the desiccator to degas the PDMS for 60 min. Keep the mold overnight in a 60 °C oven to cure the PDMS. Make sure that it is lying on a horizontal plane.\nCool down the PDMS to room temperature. Cut the device to an area of approximately 5.5 x 5 cm2, which can cover all channel patterns, and peel it off of the mold. Store the fabricated bottom PDMS layer away from ambient dust for later assembly.\nFabrication of the PDMS membrane\n\t\t\nSpin coat approximate 4 g of PDMS pre-polymer onto a silanized blank wafer at 100 rpm for 90 sec and then 3,000 rpm for 4 sec. Bake the spin-coated wafer in a 60 °C oven overnight.\nAssembly of the device\n\t\t\nPlace the fabricated PDMS-PC top layer and the wafer with the spin-coated PDMS membrane in an O2 plasma surface treatment machine with the bonding surfaces facing up. Treat the PDMS surfaces with 90 W of O2 plasma for 40 sec.\nBond the top layer onto the PDMS membrane right after the O2 plasma surface treatment. Place a weight (about 600 g) on top of the bonded layers and put them in a 60 °C oven overnight to promote bonding.\nCool down the bonded layers to room temperature and cut the membrane bonded to the top layer with a scalpel to an area of approximately 5.5 x 5 cm2, which can cover all channel patterns. Peel off the bonded structure from the silicon wafer and punch holes at the inlets and outlet of the chemical gradient channel using a 2 mm-diameter biopsy punch.",
    "Place the membrane-bonded top layer and the fabricated PDMS bottom layer in the O2 plasma surface treatment machine, with the bonding surfaces facing up, to activate the PDMS surfaces using the plasma at 90 W for 40 sec.\nAttach the top and bottom layers together for bonding immediately after the surface treatment. Place a weight (about 600 g) on top of the entire bonded device and put it in a 60 °C oven overnight.\nTake the entire fabricated device out of the oven and cool it down to room temperature.\n2. Microfluidic Cell Migration Assay\nNOTE: In this paper, we use a commonly used cell line, adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cell (A549), and a chemokine, stromal cell derived factor (SDF-1α), as examples. For researchers working on other cells and chemokines, please adjust the experimental processes accordingly.\nDay 0: Cell preparation\nCulture the stock of A549 cells in complete growth medium containing DMEM F12 L-glutamine substitute, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 1% (v/v) antimicrob-antimycotic solution.
