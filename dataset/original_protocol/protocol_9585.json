    "The yeast strains utilized in this study are documented in the Table of Materials. These strains exhibit robust growth within the temperature range of 22 °C to 30 °C and can be cultivated in various standard yeast media.\n1. Setting up the automation workstation\nEquip the automated workstation with a Robotic Gripper Arm (RGA, see Table of Materials) capable of moving microwell plates (Figure 1).\nInstall a microplate heater shaker (see Table of Materials) into the automated workstation (Figure 1(1)) with an automatic plate locking mechanism that provides RGA access.\nPosition a microplate reader adjacent to the automated workstation (Figure 1(2)), ensuring RGA accessibility.\nIncorporate a microplate illumination device (Figure 1(3)) that allows convenient RGA access. Examples include the optoPlate8 (as used in this study) or LITOS9 (see Table of Materials).\n2. Preparation of the illumination device\nConstruct and calibrate the optoPlate (or alternative illumination device) following established methods8,10,11.\nUtilize an adaptor on the illumination device to enable RGA access.\nProgram the optoPlate using a spreadsheet input10 or a graphical interface12. Follow step 3 to execute the light stimulation programs.\n3. Designing a light stimulation program\nDetermine the desired light conditions for the experiment.\nEnter the desired light conditions, including light intensity, light start time, pulse length, pulse number, and interpulse duration, into a spreadsheet.\n\tNOTE: Flash this information onto the optoPlate using the instructions provided in the GitHub repository: github.com/mccleanlab/Optoplate-96. Remember that the sample plate will not be illuminated while in the microplate reader or on the heater shaker. The duration and frequency of these events may require optimization based on specific experimental requirements.\nInclude dark conditions for each strain to enable proper background measurements.\nFor initial characterization experiments to assess transformant functionality, use a high light intensity.",
    "​NOTE: The light intensity should be optimized for more sensitive experiments, as excessive light can be phototoxic to yeast13.\n4. Preparation of the microplate reader\nConfigure the microplate reader to measure the desired quantity of interest before conducting experiments.\n\tNOTE: In this example, the microplate reader was configured to measure fluorescence from a reporter expressed by the strain of interest. Other outputs, such as luminescence or optical density, can be used depending on the experimental requirements.\nCultivate the strain of interest (along with a nonfluorescent control) in synthetic complete (SC) media14 (or another low fluorescence media) (see Table of Materials) to the highest cell density to be measured. Transfer the cultures into a glass-bottom black-walled microwell plate (see Table of Materials) and measure them to determine the optimal microplate reader settings.\n\tNOTE: Ensure accurate readings by correctly entering the plate dimensions and measuring the plate from below.\nRefer to a fluorescent protein database (for example, fpbase.org) to obtain approximate absorption and emission spectra for the target fluorescent protein15.\nDetermine the z-value (distance between the plate and reader) by performing a z-scan on wells containing the fluorescent and nonfluorescent strains. Select the z-value that yields the highest signal-to-noise ratio.\nOptimize the absorption and emission spectra by conducting absorption and emission scans on the fluorescent and nonfluorescent strains to determine the optimal signal-to-noise ratio.\nMeasure the fluorescent strain with the gain set to the optimal level, determining the highest optical gain that can be used without resulting in an overflow measurement error.\n\t​NOTE: This optical gain should be manually set consistently across experiments involving the same strain to ensure consistency of the results.",
    "Prepare a measurement script (refer to Figure 2) in the microplate reader software. This script configures the instrument to measure the optical density of the cultures and the fluorescence spectra of any fluorescent proteins to be measured.\n\t​NOTE: Measure the optical density of strains at 600 nm unless they express red fluorescent proteins. For strains expressing red fluorescent proteins, measure the optical density at 700 nm to avoid bias16.\nSet the measurement script to maintain an internal incubation temperature of 30 °C during measurements.\nConfigure the measurement script to export the data into a spreadsheet or ASCII files, according to preference.\n5. Programming the robot\nConfigure the worktable definition in the automated workstation software based on the physical layout of carriers (e.g., heater shakers, nest platforms, illumination devices) and the labware (i.e., the 96-well plate) (see Table of Materials). Create a script in the automation workstation software to execute light induction and measurements (Figure 3), following the below steps.\nDisable any internal illumination sources to prevent background activation of optogenetic systems.\nSet the heater shaker to maintain a temperature of 30 °C. When the plate is not on the heater shaker, it will be at ambient temperature (22 °C).\nUtilize loops, a timer, and a loop counting variable to repeat the steps of inducing and measuring the cells at regular intervals.\nBefore recording measurements, shake the sample plate to ensure proper suspension of all cells. A 60 s shake at 1,000 rpm with a 2 mm orbital is generally sufficient to resuspend S288C S. cerevisiae cells and avoid measurement bias.",
    "Move the sample plate to the microplate reader using the robot arm and remove the lid (if applicable) to prevent bias in optical density measurement. The control software will automatically remove and replace the lid to the designated position if the microplate reader carrier definition is set to not allow lids.\nExecute the microplate reader measurement script as described in step 4.\nReplace the lid on the sample plate and move the plate to the illumination device using the robot arm.\nSet the script to wait until the timer reaches the specified time interval (e.g., 30 min multiplied by the loop counting variable) and then repeat the entire loop for the desired number of iterations (e.g., 48 times for a 24 h experiment).\nTroubleshoot potential errors and ensure the proper functioning of the carrier and labware definitions, as well as the RGA's ability to accurately pick up and place the plate by running an empty plate through the script loop multiple times.\nConfigure user alerts to notify the user of any instrument state changes or errors that may occur during the execution of the protocol.\n6. Setting up the sample plate\nGrow yeast strains on rich media plates, such as YPD agar17 (see Table of Materials). Include a nonfluorescent (negative) control.\nSelect colonies from the plates and inoculate them into 3 mL of SC media14 (or another low fluorescence media, such as LFM18) in glass culture tubes. Incubate the cultures overnight at 30 °C on a roller drum while keeping them in the dark or under non-responsive light conditions (e.g., red light for blue light-responsive systems).",
    "Measure the optical density of the overnight cultures by diluting 200 µL of each culture into 1 mL of SC media and recording the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) using a spectrophotometer or microplate reader.\nDilute each overnight culture to an OD600 of 0.1 in glass culture tubes. For higher throughput strain testing, perform automated dilutions in microwell plates.\nPipette the diluted cultures into the 96-well plate. Include triplicate wells for each condition (i.e., three identical wells with the same strain and light condition) to account for technical variation. Include wells with blank media and nonfluorescent cells as negative controls to measure background fluorescence and optical density.\nIncubate the plate at 30 °C with shaking for 5 h before commencing the light induction experiment. Adjust the dilution amounts and incubation times as necessary to optimize for specific strains and experimental conditions.\n7. Performing the experiment\nPlace the sample plate onto the heater shaker and initiate the automation script as outlined in step 5.\nCommence the light stimulation program as described in step 3 once the initial measurement on the plate reader has been recorded.\nIf the automation workstation is not in a dark room, cover it with a blackout curtain to avoid background illumination.\n8. Data analysis\nCreate a spreadsheet map for the experiment, reflecting the 8 x 12 layout of the 96-well plate. Ensure that the map includes the names of the strains being measured in one grid and descriptions of the light conditions used in another grid.\nUtilize a Python script or another preferred programming language to analyze the exported data. Import the map spreadsheet into an array, associating the strain names and condition names with each well of the plate.",
    "NOTE: Sample code for analysis can be found at: https://github.com/mccleanlab/Lustro. Alternatively, one can employ an application to parse data from various plate readers19.\nRead the data from the exported experiment spreadsheet into another array.\nGenerate plots of the optical density values and fluorescence values for each strain and condition over time, as illustrated in Figure 4.\nExamine the optical density plots to determine the stages of exponential growth or saturation in the cultures. This information will aid in selecting appropriate timepoints for comparing fluorescence measurements between strains or conditions, as depicted in Figure 5.\nSubscription Required.
