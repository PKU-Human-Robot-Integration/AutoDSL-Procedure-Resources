    "1. Calcium imaging\nFly larvae preparation\n\tNOTE: Flies and larvae are maintained at 25 °C under a 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle.\n\t\nAnesthetize the flies with CO2. Sort 20-45 males and 20-45 females into each fly vial, and give them at least 24 h to 48 h to recover from the CO2 exposure.\n\t\tNOTE: Fly exposure to CO2 should last for the shortest amount of time possible.\nTo synchronize the larvae age, tap over the flies into new vials containing yeast granules, and allow them 4-8 h to lay eggs. Remove the flies by flipping them into new vials.\nCollect the larvae at 72 h using 10 mL of 20% w/v sucrose solution.\nMicroscope and temperature control setup\n\t\nPerform the imaging on a confocal microscope (see the Table of Materials) and a z-axis piezo stage with a stage insert using the following settings: laser, Argon; scan mode, frame; frame size, 512 x 512; speed, maximum; channels/bit depth, 1/8 Bit; zoom, 1.5; z-stack, slice =15, Keep = slice; focus devices and strategy, Definite focus; focus, Definite focus on.\nAttach a Peltier cooling module to a heat sink by the heat transfer compound to build a thermoelectric cooler. The Peltier is powered by a 2 A power supply.\nAttach a thermocouple microprobe to a data acquisition device to record the temperature.\nCalcium imaging\n\t\nRinse the larvae 3x in 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nPipette 75 μL of 1x PBS onto the center of a glass slide.\nPut one or two larvae in 1x PBS and place the thermocouple microprobe near the larvae.\n\t\tNOTE: The distance between the larvae and the microprobe should be ~5 mm. The larvae may move if the microprobe is positioned too close to them. A great distance could result in inaccurate temperature readings.",
    "Cover the larvae and thermocouple microprobe with a glass coverslip. Seal the coverslip with nail polish.\nPlace the slide on the microscope stage, find the focus using a 25x objective, and place the thermoelectric cooler on the slide.\n\t\tNOTE: The Peltier is placed directly on the slide where the larvae are to deliver the temperature stimuli.\nIn confocal software, focus on the fluorescent cells of interest. Adjust the laser power to avoid oversaturation. Set the first and last slice positions in the z-stack setting.\n\t\t​NOTE: Use the lowest possible laser power before recording to prevent photobleaching.\nStart the z-stack scanning and temperature recording at the same time.\nControl the power supply that powers the Peltier to change the Peltier surface temperature. Turn on the power supply to decrease the temperature and turn it off to increase the temperature.\nStop the z-stack scanning and temperature recording.\n2. Analysis of the 3D calcium imaging data\nExport the calcium imaging data to TIFF files and save them in a folder with the same name as the base name of the TIFF files inside.\n\tNOTE: The filename must not contain any commas.\n\t\nUse the following parameters to export the calcium imaging data from ZEN (black edition): file type, TIFF; compression, LZW; channels, 2; Z-position, all; time, all; phase, 1; region, full.\nInstallation\n\t\nDownload TACI-Calcium_Imaging.jar from Github (https://github.com/niflylab/TACI_CalciumImagingPlugin/releases).\nInstall the plugin in FIJI by clicking on Plugins in the menu bar and then clicking on Install in the dropdown menu (Plugins | Install). Then, restart FIJI.\n\t\tNOTE: Do NOT use Plugins | Install Plugin.\nRun the plugin by clicking on Plugins and then choosing TACI-Calcium Imaging (Plugins | TACI-Calcium Imaging).\nUse the RENAME function to convert the TIFF filenames to the required structure.",
    "NOTE: The tool uses filename_h#t#z#c#.tif as the default structure (h# and c# are optional; #: a positive integer). If the image filenames are not in the default structure, the RENAME function must be executed.\n\t\nChoose the folder in which the TIFF images need renaming by clicking Browse Folders.\nFill in the parameter information. Five parameters are listed, including Filename, Phase, Max T-Position, Max Z-Position, and Channel. Each parameter has three values: Preceding Text, Parameter Value, and Order.\n\t\tNOTE: The information is case-sensitive. If the image filenames contain a phrase before a parameter, fill in the phrase as the Preceding Text of the corresponding parameter. If the image filenames contain a phrase after all parameters, fill in the phrase as the Post Text.\n\t\t\nBe sure to enter Filename, Max T-Position, and Max Z-Position and that the parameter values for Max T-Position and Max Z-Position include all digits.\nWait for the Filename to be automatically filled using the folder name.\nIf the TIFF filenames do not include the phase and channel, leave the corresponding parameter value blank, and choose Na in Order.\nClick Rename to create a folder with the same name and _r. Observe that in the folder, the TIFF filenames have been restructured to be compatible with the ORGANIZE function.\n\t\tNOTE: _r has been added to the filenames of the TIFF images.\nUse the ORGANIZE function to save the TIFF images from the same z-position in one folder.\n\tNOTE: The folder name must have the same name as the base name of the TIFF files inside and must NOT have any commas.\n\t\nChoose the folder in which the TIFF images need organizing by clicking Browse Folders.\nIf the parameter CSV file (param.csv) exists, wait for the parameter values to be filled in automatically.",
    "NOTE: The param.csv file has a required format. The parameters, including filename, phase, position_t, position_z, channel, and is_gray, must be filled in in row 1 from left to right starting from column A. Corresponding values for each parameter must be filled in in row 2.\nIf the parameter CSV file (param.csv) does not exist, manually fill in the parameter values. Ensure that the parameter values of Phase and Channel include letters, while the parameter values of T Position and Z Position should be the largest numbers of the t- and z-positions. If the image filenames do not include the phase or channel, enter Na.\nCreate grayscale TIFF images when needed. Leave the box of Are images gray? unchecked to grayscale the images.\nClick Organize to create a folder with the same name and _gray_stacks and to generate folders with the same name and _# (#: z-positions) in the folder. Observe that the TIFF files are sorted into corresponding folders by z-positions and that a file named param.csv is generated, in which the parameters and their values can be found.\nUse TrackMate in FIJI to extract the fluorescence intensities of the cells of interest from each z-position.\n\tNOTE: This step can also be accomplished by other imaging software.\n\t\nOpen the TIFF images in a z-position folder by FIJI.\nRun TrackMate by clicking on Plugins | Tracking | TrackMate, and adjust the following parameters if necessary.\n\t\t\nUse DoG or LoG detectors.\nChange the blob diameter, threshold, and median filter. Adjust the blob diameter to be similar to the diameter of the cells. If the cells are oval, adjust the blob diameter to be similar to the minor axis.",
    "NOTE: Increasing the threshold helps avoid background noise being picked up as signals without affecting the signal intensities (Supplementary Figure 1). However, an increase in the threshold may miss true signals (Supplementary Figure 1). If the signals are strong, use the median filter to decrease the Salt and Pepper noise.\nSet the filters to remove some, if not all, of the irrelevant signals. Filters X and Y are spatial filters. Use filters X and Y to remove the irrelevant signals that are distant from the real signals.\n\t\t\tNOTE: When filters are set on one image, it is crucial to check all the other images to ensure that the real signals are not removed.\nSet the linking max distance, gap-closing max distance, and gap-closing max frame gap. Set the linking max distance and gap-closing max distance to be 3x-5x the blob diameter, especially when the samples move significantly over time, to help decrease the number of tracks. Set the gap-closing max frame gap to the number of images in the stack.\nExport the fluorescence intensities of the regions of interest (ROIs) to a CSV file. If an old TrackMate version is used, choose Export all spots statistics in the Select an action window. If the TrackMate version is 7.6.1 or higher, choose the Spots in the Display options window. Export or save as the interactive files to CSV files.",
    "NOTE: Both files are interactive with the image window; highlighting an ROI displays the corresponding ROI in the image window. These files include the mean intensities (MEAN_INTENSITY or MEAN_INTENSITY_CH1) of the cells of interest at corresponding time points (POSITION_T). The same TRACK_IDs should represent the same ROIs at different time points. However, this is not always true and may need to be corrected manually, when necessary. If TrackMate does not recognize the ROIs at some time points, those time points are not displayed.\nExtract the background fluorescence intensity, and create the Background_list.csv file.\n\tNOTE: In this study, the background intensity for each z-position was estimated by using the average value of three to five neighboring same-size blobs that did not contain fluorescence signals and were from different time points.\n\t\nThe Background_list.csv file has a required format: each column contains the information of one neuron, starting from Neuron 0. Fill in the neuron numbers, such as Neuron 0, in row 1. Then, provide the background intensity for each z-position analyzed-if five z-positions are analyzed for Neuron 0, fill in five background intensity values below Neuron 0.\n\t\tNOTE: The Background_list.csv file is required for the TACI EXTRACT function. If the background is negligible, the Background_list.csv with the zero-background intensity of every neuron must be provided.\nUse the EXTRACT function to identify the maximum fluorescence intensities at each t-position and calculate ΔF/F0 as shown in equation (1).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64953/64953eq02.jpg    (1)",
    "Create a folder and name it using the neuron number, starting from Neuron 0. Save the CSV files containing the fluorescence information of the corresponding neuron in the folder. Each CSV file contains the information of one z-position, so the number of CSV files equals the number of z-positions analyzed. Name the CSV files as Mean_Intensity#.csv (# represents the z-position) and each CSV file includes at least two columns: POSITION_T and MEAN_INTENSITY or MEAN_INTENSITY_CH1.\n\t\tNOTE: Create a folder for every cell of interest.\nSave the Background_list.csv file and folders created in step 2.7.1 in one folder. Choose this folder by clicking on Browse Files.\n\t\tNOTE: The number of background values in the Background_list.csv file must match the number of the Mean_Intensity#.csv files for each neuron.\nThe Background File is automatically filled in. Fill in the largest number of t-positions for the Number of T Positions.\nClick Extract to create a results folder, including the CSV files and plots for each neuron. The CSV files include information on the maximum fluorescence intensity and ΔF/F0 at each t-position. The plots are line charts of ΔF/F0 over t-positions.\n\t\tNOTE: In this study, ΔF/F0 was calculated using equation (1). The first value of each z-position was used as F0. If this F0 is not appropriate20, the plugin provides files including raw data for each neuron in the python_files folder.\nUse the MERGE function to average each neuron's ΔF/F0, calculate the SEM, and plot the average ΔF/F0 over t-positions.\n\t\nChoose the results folder created by the EXTRACT function by clicking on Browse Files.\nFill in the Number of T Positions with the largest number of t-positions.",
    "Click Merge to create a merged_data folder, including a merged_data.csv file and an Average_dF_F0.png plot. The CSV file includes the information on the average and SEM ΔF/F0 at each t-position. The plot is a line chart of the average ΔF/F0 over t-positions.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
