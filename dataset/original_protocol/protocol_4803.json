    "Circulating immune complex preparation   Two hundred microliters of the test sera were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min to remove any suspended particles.   Next, 150 μl of the upper layer of the sera was collected and mixed with equal volume of 7% PEG. This gives a final concentration of 3.5% PEG in the sera.   The sera were then vortexed and left overnight at 4 °C for precipiation of the immune complex.   The next day, the precipitated immune complex was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was washed two times with 3.5% PEG.    The circulating immune complex was finally dissolved in 0.01 M PBS and made up to the original volume of 150 μl.      Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay   Polystyrene ELISA plates (96 wells, Nunc Maxisorp, flat bottom) were coated with 5 μg/ml of CFA, 1 μg/ml for 38 and 30 kDa and 0.2 μg/ml for 16 kDa of purified mycobacterial antigen in Carbonate buffer (pH 9.6). The plates were incubated with antigen overnight at 4 °C. Note: Mycobacterial antigen is purified in the lab.    The plates were washed four times with PBS buffer containing 0.1 % Tween 20 by the automatic ELISA washer.    The non-specific sites in the wells were blocked with blocking solution for 1 h at 37 °C. After four washes with PBST, the plates were incubated for one hour at 37 °C with the precipitated circulating immune complex in 1/100 dilution. The plates were washed four times after 1 h incubation at 37 °C .The plates were then incubated with antihuman IgG peroxidase conjugate.   At the end of 1 h of incubation at 37 °C and washing, the colour was developed by the addition of 100 μl of the substrate to each well.",
    "After arresting the reaction with 50 μl of 8 N H2SO4, the optical density was read in the Spectromax ELISA reader at 490 nm wavelength.  Note: IgA and IgM antibody determination were also carried out among the same patients and healthy subjects. For this, Antihuman IgA and Antihuman IgM were used in the dilution of 1:500 and 1:1, 000 respectively.   Antibody estimation for IgG, A and M isotypes were carried out for CIC precipitated patients and normal healthy serum. The ELISA positivity was calculated based on the OD values of the mean plus two standard deviation of the normal healthy serum. This value was used as the cut off value to decide the Elisa positivity of the unknown serum."
