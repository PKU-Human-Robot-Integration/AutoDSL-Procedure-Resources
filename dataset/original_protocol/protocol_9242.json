    "1. Preparation of reagents\nNotes before beginning: Dissection and immunohistochemical staining are carried out in a magnetic chamber and the larva is pinned down using specially shaped insect pins. Detailed instructions on the construction of a magnetic chamber, and preparation of these pins can be found in related references 14,15. In brief, a 1x1cm square hole is cut into a magnetic sheet and a coverslip affixed to the rear of the sheet to make a small chamber. The sides of the chamber are sealed with epoxy glue; after this glue has set the chamber is washed several times with 70% ethanol before use. Dissection insect pins are prepared by bending to the required shape and then glued onto a metal tab14,15. Alternatively to a metal tab, we have used an inverted flat-head steel drawing pin with a handle made from a cut-off yellow tip. Use of this magnetic chamber arrangement allows close control over pin positioning and tissue stretching during dissection.\nTo drive reporter gene expression in different subsets of DA neurons investigators may use several different Gal4 lines (summarized by Shimono and colleagues16). Many of these lines are available from public stock centers. In this representative protocol, we carry out immunostaining of a line in which two contrasting classes of DA neuron are co-labeled: the most simple- class I and most complex- class IV (P10-Gal417,18, UAS-mCD8::Kusabira-Orange (KO)).\nPrepare Ca++-free HL3.1 saline\n \nIn mM: 70 NaCl, 5 KCl, 20 MgCl2 , 10 NaHCO3 , 5 HEPES, 115 sucrose, and 5 trehalose; pH 7.219. Filter-sterilize and store at 4°C. Note: Ca++-free solution prevents muscle contraction during dissection.\nPrepare 2x PHEM buffer\n \nIn mM: 130 PIPES, 60 HEPES, 20 EGTA, 4 MgSO4; pH 7.0. Filter-sterilize and store at 4°C.\n  Note: These materials will not dissolve until the pH approaches 7.0.",
    "Prepare the fixative freshly immediately before the fixation.\n \nIn order to prepare a 25ml solution, first mix 2g paraformaldehyde, 100μl 1M NaOH and 10ml water in a 50ml Falcon tube.\nShake fixative in a 55°C water bath with shaker until the solution is clear. (Total volume will be about 11.5 ml.)\nCool fixative on ice.\nAdd 12.5ml 2x PHEM buffer.\nAdjust pH to 7.0 with 1M HCl.\nFill the solution with water until the volume is 25ml.\nFilter the solution using Whatman paper.\n2. Larval dissection\nNote before beginning: Microtubule networks, and particularly those in sensory dendrites, will breakdown rapidly after the initiation of dissection. Achieving fast dissection in less than five minutes followed by immediate fixation are key factors in the success of this protocol.\nWash the larva in water and quickly move them into this drop using a loop of hair.\nOrient the larva dorsal side up and the ventral side on the glass. Note: This orientation is to examine the ventral cluster neurons. To examine dorsal cluster neurons, invert the orientation.\nUse the center insect-pin to pin the anterior end near the mouth hooks. Place the pin close to the end for best results.\nPlace a drop of HL3.1 saline in the dissection chamber.\nCut the very posterior tip of the larva off with microscissors. Note: This step opens an aperture at the posterior end of the larva that will allow access for the microscissors (step 2.7).\nGrab with the forceps the region of gut that is now poking out of the aperture at the posterior end of the larva. Gently pull out the whole gut.\nPlace the tip of one blade of the microscissors through the aperture and cut along the ventral midline towards the anterior.",
    "Using the corner pins, pin the now free corners, posterior first, then anterior. Simultaneously gently stretch open the larval fillet.\n3. Fixation, blocking, staining, and mounting of larval fillets\nNotes before beginning: All fixation and staining steps are carried out in the dissection chamber. During this process, be careful not to knock the insect pins holding the larva as this may lead to tissue damage. To prevent the experiment from drying out, do all staining steps in a small Tupperware container surrounded by moistened tissues.\nAspirate the Ca++-free HL3.1 buffer using a yellow tip. Immediately add the fixative using another pipetteman.\nGently pipette up and down to mix the fixative with the remaining traces of Ca++-free HL3.1 buffer in the chamber. Immediately aspirate it and then add fresh fixative into the chamber.\nIncubate at room temperature for 20 minutes.\nWash 6x 10mins in PBST (0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS).\nBlock with 5% goat serum in PBST for 20 mins at RT.\nReplace the blocking solution with primary antibodies diluted in 5% goat serum in PBST. The primary antibodies used are mouse anti-α-Tubulin (DM1A) and rat anti-CD8 (5H10) both diluted 1/1000.\n Note: The investigator may wish to substitute mouse anti-α-Tubulin (DM1A) with mouse anti-Futsch (22C10)20,21 diluted 1/1000 in some circumstances (see discussion).\nIncubate overnight (for at least 16h) at 4°C.\nWash 6x 10mins in PBST.\nAdd secondary antibody solution diluted in 5% goat serum in PBST. The secondary antibodies used are Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG and Cy3 donkey anti-rat IgG. Keep the sample covered to prevent fluorophore photo-bleaching22.\nIncubate either at RT for two hours, or overnight at 4°C followed by one hour at room temperature.\nWash 6x 10mins in PBST.",
    "Place the larval fillet on the slide cuticle-side down, mount in 80% glycerol, and seal the sides of the coverslip with nail polish for a 'quick' mount.\n Note: For improved tissue clearing, and a permanent stable sample, mount in DPX as previously described23.\n4. Representative Results:\nFluorescent staining was examined under a confocal microscope. In Figures 1-2, different branches within a dendrite arbor have different cytoskeletal organization. Figure 1 shows a region of the arbor of a class IV DA neuron at the 1st instar larval stage. The whole arbor is marked with mCD8::KO and detected using an anti-CD8 antibody and fluorescent secondary (Cy3). Tubulin is detected using anti α-Tubulin antibody and fluorescent secondary (Alexa Fluor 488). The main branches are positive for Tubulin, some thin side branches are Tubulin-negative. Movie 1 is a set of serial sections through a similar staining of a class I DA neuron. Figure 2 shows a region of the arbor of a class IV DA neuron stained with antibodies against Futsch and CD8 at the 1st instar larval stage. The main branches are Futsch-positive, some thin side branches are Futsch-negative. Figure 3. Tracheae in the larval body wall show a complex microtubule organization. Movies 2 and 3 show serial sections of staining through body wall muscles and trachea.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3662/3662fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.
