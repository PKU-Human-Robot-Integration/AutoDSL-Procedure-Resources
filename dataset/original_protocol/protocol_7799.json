    "Targeting the green laserBefore imaging, locate the focus of the green laser within the imaging plane by bleaching a piece of filter paper soaked with FITC-dextran solution. Cut a 1 x 1 cm piece of filter paper and place it in a culture dish. Cover the paper with 50 μl of FITC-dextran and overlay it with a coverslip. Place a drop of distilled water onto the surface of the cover glass and bring the filter paper into focus at the eyepiece. Use the same objective lens that you would use for photothrombosis (i.e., 20x, 1.0-NA). Use the translation stage to find an area free of bubbles. Turn off the PMTs and transition to wide-field mode. Ensure the cameral port is open and that the green laser passes through the objective. Irradiate the sample for 30 sec and then deactivate the beam. Transition back to two-photon imaging mode. An area of the filter paper should now be bleached, marking the focus of the green laser beam. Place a clear piece of tape on the computer screen over the bleached area. Use a pen to mark the location of where the laser is focused. Repeat the bleaching procedure in a different location to ensure that the location of irradiation is consistent. PhotothrombosisThis procedure requires optical access to the brain either through a skull-removed, which has been described in detail in past publications (Mostany and Portera-Cailliau, 2008; Drew et al., 2010; Shih et al., 2012a; Shih et al., 2012b) or thinned skull cranial window (Holtmaat, 2009). A method of fixing the head of the mouse for imaging is also required (Shih et al., 2012b). Anesthetize the mouse with isoflurane and affix the animal’s head in the optical imaging apparatus.",
    "The apparatus should have a method of delivering isoflurane continuously to provide anesthesia throughout the procedure.Administer 25 μl of FITC-dextran through the tail vein or retro-orbital vein to label the blood serum. Using a low magnification objective (i.e., 4x, 0.16-NA), take an image stack (200 μm deep, 5 μm steps) of the pial vasculature through the cranial window. A maximally projected image of this stack is used as a map to provide guidance when using higher magnification objectives (Figure 3a).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20130829/20130829224835_7082.jpgFigure 3. Generation of cortical microinfarct by targeted photothrombosis in mouse cortex. a. low magnification, maximally projected image of pial vasculature visualized through a thinned skull PoRTS window (Drew, 2010). The vasculature is labeled with intravenous FITC-dextran. A single penetrating arteriole within the window is identified for photothrombosis (inset). b. Green laser irradiation of a single penetrating arteriole (left panel) immediately following intravenous administration of Rose Bengal leads to localized clotting (right panel). After successful photothrombosis, a dark clot is seen at the site of irradiation and the vessel becomes brighter upstream due to stagnation of red blood cell flow. c. Post-mortem immunohistochemistry with the pan-neuronal marker NeuN demarcates the boundaries of the resulting microinfarct (yellow-dotted line), as observed 48 hours following occlusion.Exchange the low magnification lens for a high magnification objective (i.e., 20x, 1.0-NA). Place a drop of distilled water over the cranial window and bring the pial surface into focus. Navigate within the cranial window using the image made with the low magnification objective. Locate the neck of a penetrating arteriole just before it descends into the cortex. Penetrating arterioles branch from the surface arteriolar network and descend into the brain (Blinder, 2010; Shih, 2013). To confirm the identity of the target, use two-photon microscopy to image deeper layers of cortex and ensure that it penetrates into the brain.",
    "Once verified, return to the pial surface and maneuver the location of the green laser focus into the lumen of the target vessel by moving the microscope stage. Inject 50 μl of Rose Bengal solution through the tail vein or retro-orbital vein. Immediately irradiate the vessel with the green laser focus for 30 sec. Return to two-photon imaging mode. The vessel should now be occluded. A successfully occluded vessel will show no dark streaks caused by the movement of red blood cells. There will typically be a dark thrombus with a bright region of stagnant serum directly upstream (Figure 3b, right panel). If the vessel fails to occlude, the photothrombotic procedure may be repeated. Irradiation must be performed within 5 to 10 min after intravenous injection of Rose Bengal as the dye is quickly extravasated from circulation (Zhang and Murphy, 2007). The vessel should be re-examined after 1 h to ensure the vessel has not de-occluded. De-occlusion can sometimes occur with large penetrating arterioles.The occlusion of a single penetrating arteriole will result in a columnar region of ischemia in mouse cortex ranging from 300 to 500 μm in diameter and can often span the entire depth of cortex (Drew et al., 2010). This region of ischemia will eventually become infarcted and the discrete boundary between viable and infarcted tissue can be delineated with post-hoc immunohistology (Figure 3c)."
