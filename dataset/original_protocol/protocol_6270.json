    "Cell culture and maintenancePrimary Human Mammary Epithelial cellsPrimary human mammary epithelial cells (ScienCell) were isolated from human breast and cryopreserved at passage one.Prepare a poly-L-lysine (2 μg/cm2)-coated T-75 flask. To obtain a 2 μg/cm2 poly-L-lysine-coated culture vessel, add 10 ml of sterile water to a T-75 flask and then add 15 μl of poly-L-lysine stock solution (10 mg/ml). Leave the flask in a 37 °C incubator overnight. Rinse the flask. Thaw a frozen vial of cells (> 5 x 105 cells) in a 37 °C water bath, and dispense the contents of the vial into the poly-L-lysine-coated flask. Note: Dilution and centrifugation of cells after thawing are not recommended.  Gently rock the flask to distribute cells evenly. Return the culture vessel to the incubator, and leave the culture undisturbed for at least 16 h after initiation. Replace medium the next day to remove residual DMSO and unattached cells. Thereafter, change the medium every three days, until the culture is approximately 70% confluent. Once the culture reaches 70% confluence, change the medium every other day until the culture is approximately 90% confluent. Subculture when cells reach 90% confluence. Gently rinse the flask with PBS and add 4 ml 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA solution into the flask. Gently rock the flask to ensure complete coverage of cells by Trypsin/EDTA solution, return the flask to the 37 °C incubator and incubate it for 2-3 min or until cells have detached.After cells have completely detached from the flask, add 180 μl of soybean trypsin inhibitor to the flask and transfer detached cells to a 15 ml centrifuge tube. Centrifuge the tube at 400 x g for 5 min and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the cell pellet in culture medium and plate them in new poly-L-lysine-coated flasks at the seeding density of 5,000 cells/cm2.",
    "Cells can undergo ten population doublings (early passages are recommended).MCF10A Human Mammary Epithelial cellsMCF10A cells were collected from human fibrocystic breast tissue and went through spontaneous immortalization. MCF10A cells maintain many characteristics of normal cells, including (a) the inability to form tumors in nude mice; (b) dependence on growth factors and hormones for growth and survival; and (c) lack of anchorage-independent growth (Soule et al., 1990). Culturing of MCF10A cells follows the protocol described by Debnath et al. (2003) with slight modifications.Thaw a frozen vial of cells (1 x 106 cells) in a 37 °C water bath and dispense the contents of the vial into a T-75 flask containing 10 ml culture medium. Gently rock the flask to distribute cells evenly. Return the culture vessel to the incubator and leave the culture undisturbed for at least 16 h after initiation.  Replace medium the next day to remove residual DMSO and unattached cells. Change the medium every three days until the culture is approximately 70% confluent. Once cells reach 70% confluence, change the medium every other day until the culture is approximately 90% confluent. Subculture when cells reach 90% confluence. Gently rinse the flask with PBS and add 4 ml 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA solution into flask. Gently rock the flask to ensure complete coverage of cells by Trypsin/EDTA solution, return the flask to the 37 °C incubator and incubate it for 2-3 min or cells have completely detached. Add 180 μl of soybean trypsin inhibitor to the flask and transfer detached cells to a 15 ml centrifuge tube.Centrifuge the tube at 400 x g for 5 min and discard the supernatant. Resuspend cell pellets in culture medium and plate them in new flasks at a 1:3 ratio. Cells can undergo 35 passages (early passages are recommended).",
    "HMT-3522 S1 Human Mammary Epithelial cellsHMT-3522 S1 was derived from a benign mammary fibrocystic lesion and became spontaneously immortalized in culture (Briand et al., 1987; Moyret et al., 1994; Rizki et al., 2008; Vidi et al., 2013). S1 cells retain non-malignant characteristics, requiring EGF to grow in culture and being unable to form tumors in nude mice (Briand et al., 1987; Rizki et al., 2008; Vidi et al., 2013). Note: The use of S1 cells is restricted to passages below 60 because of genotypic drift at higher passages (Rizki et al., 2008; Vidi et al., 2013). Culturing of HMT-3522 S1 cells follows the protocol described by Vidi et al. (2013) with slight modifications.Thaw a frozen vial of cells (1 x 106 cells) in a 37 °C water bath, and dispense the contents of the vial into a centrifuge tube with 5 ml of growth medium. Centrifuge the tube at 400 x g for 5 min.Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 3 ml of fresh growth medium.Add 7 ml fresh growth medium into a T-75 flask and transfer the whole cell suspension.Return the culture vessel to the incubator and leave the culture undisturbed for two days after initiation. Change the medium every other day until colonies start forming rounded islands (the edges of the colonies become smooth). Note: This phenomenon usually takes place when the culture reaches ~60% confluence (6~10 days after plating). Subculture when cells reach 60% confluence. Rinse the cells with 1 ml 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA solution and add 1 ml 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA solution into the flask. Gently rock the flask to ensure complete coverage of cells by Trypsin/EDTA solution, return the flask to the incubator and incubate it at 37 °C for 2-3 min.",
    "Add 180 μl of soybean trypsin inhibitor to the flask and transfer detached cells to a 15 ml centrifuge tube.Centrifuge the tube at 400 x g for 5 min and then discard the supernatant. Resuspend cells in 3 ml culture medium and count cell density. Place 10 ml growth medium into a T-75 flask.Seed 1.5 x 106 cells in a T-75 flask (2 x 104 cells/cm2). Cells can be used until 60 passages (early passages are recommended).Primary Human Mammary FibroblastsPrimary human mammary fibroblasts (ScienCell) were isolated from human breast and cryopreserved at passage one.Prepare a poly-L-lysine (2 μg/cm2)-coated T-75 flask as mentioned above.Thaw a frozen vial of cells (> 5 x 105 cells) in a 37 °C water bath, and dispense the contents of the vial into the poly-L-lysine-coated flask. Gently rock the flask to distribute cells evenly. Return the culture vessel to the incubator and leave the culture undisturbed for at least 16 h after initiation. Replace medium the next day to remove residual DMSO and unattached cells. Change the medium every three days thereafter, until the culture is approximately 70% confluent. Once cells reach 70% confluence, change the medium every other day until the culture is approximately 90% confluent. Subculture when cells reach 90% confluence. Rinse the cells with PBS and add 10 ml of 0.05% Trypsin/EDTA solution into flask. Gently rock the flask to ensure complete coverage of cells by Trypsin/EDTA solution, return the flask to the incubator and incubate it at 37 °C for 2-3 min. Add 180 μl of soybean trypsin inhibitor to the flask and transfer detached cells to a 15 ml centrifuge tube.Centrifuge the tube at 400 x g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.",
    "Resuspend the cells in culture medium and plate them in new poly-L-lysine-coated flasks at the seeding density of 5,000 cells/cm2.Cells can undergo 15 population doublings.Construction of a micropatterning stamp (Figure 1)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190926/20190926201612_0233.jpgFigure 1. Construction of micropatterning stampA custom stamp for micropatterning the ECM in a 12-well plate insert is constructed as follows: To find the center of a round wooden disk, draw two parallel chords with equal length across the circle with a pencil. Draw an “X” that links the ends of the chords diagonally. Mark the intersection of the “X” as the center of the circle. Using a pencil, mark four 2 mm-spots on the disk at 5 mm from the center, 2 mm apart from each other.Secure the disk horizontally in a drill press vice.Using a hand drill in conjunction with 2 mm-drill bit, drill four holes through the spots marked on the disk.Using a hand drill in conjunction with 5 mm-drill bit, drill two access holes on the opposite ends of the disk. Remove the disk from the drill press vice.Insert 2.5-mm stainless steel rods into the 2 mm-holes on the disk. This provides a press fit for rods to hold them in place until they are secured with epoxy.Adjust the rods so that the 9 mm-ends of the rods remain above the top surface of the disk and 13 mm-ends of the rods protrude from the bottom surface of the disk.Mix and apply a small amount of epoxy to the perimeter of the rods on the top side of the disk where they meet the disk to secure them in place. Air-dry the stamp as recommended on the package of the epoxy.",
    "Clean the metal rods of the stamp lightly with 70% alcohol, and UV-irradiate the stamp for 10-20 min in a tissue culture hood for sterilization before use.Preparation of 3D organotypic co-culture (Figure 2)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190926/20190926201638_6623.jpgFigure 2.
