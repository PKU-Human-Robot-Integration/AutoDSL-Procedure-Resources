  "procedures": [
    "All experimentation involving human tissue described herein was approved in advance by University of Liverpool, University Hospital Aintree Hospital and South West Wales Research Ethics Committee (Approval No: 13/WA/0374) and experiments were performed according to good practice guidance. The University of Liverpool acted as the ethics sponsor for this study. All the donors have given informed consent for the enrolment of this study. The muscles were isolated from people (BMI <25): adult: 30 ±2.8 years old and aged: 69 ±5 years old.\n1. Preparation for Culture\nCoating of culture surfaces with laminin\nPrepare a working solution of 10 µg/mL of laminin in 1x DPBS (Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline).\nPipette a minimum amount of laminin solution to completely cover the surface onto which cells are going to be plated (Table 1). Incubate the culture dish at least 30 min in a humidified 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator before plating the cells. Handle laminin carefully, avoiding the use of vortex. The working solution of 10 µg/mL laminin diluted in DPBS can be stored at 4 °C and re-used several times.\nUse a 60 mm (20 cm2) Petri dish or 2 wells in a 6-well plate (2 x 10 cm2) per ~18 - 19 mg of skeletal muscle to plate the cells (5.50 x 104 cells in total). Perform cell counting at all times when plating cells for functional studies.\n\t\tNOTE: Samples were originally obtained from foot surgeries (extensor digitorum brevis, tibialis anterior or abductor halluces muscles) of female patients (adult: 30 ±2.8 years old, aged: 69 ±5 years old, BMI <25).\nPreparation of enzymatic solution\nPrepare 250 mM CaCl2 working solution: 277 mg of stock CaCl2 in 10 mL 1x DPBS. Filter the solution with a 0.2 µm filter membrane and store at 4 °C.",
    "Prepare a working solution of 1.5 U/mL of collagenase D, 2.4 U/mL of Dispase II and 2.5 mM CaCl2 in serum-free DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium) (Table 2).\nMix well and filter the enzymatic solution through a 0.2 µm filter membrane for sterilization. Prepare the enzymatic solution in advance and freeze down (-20 °C) in aliquots for future use.\n2. Tissue Digestion: Mechanical and Enzymatic Dissociation\nFollowing sample collection, keep muscle at 4 °C in DPBS until digestion. Prepare a minimum volume of 2 mL of collagenase-dispase-CaCl2 solution per 18 - 19 mg of muscle tissue and warm it to 37 °C before tissue dissociation.\nImmerse the muscle biopsy briefly in 70% ethanol, wash with fresh DPBS and place the tissue on a new Petri dish with 1 mL of enzymatic solution.\nDiscard as much fibrotic and fat tissue as possible and tear the muscle quickly but gently into small but distinguishable pieces (approximately >0.5 mm2) with sterile scissors or a surgical scalpel (blade No. 10).\nTransfer the sample into a 50 mL tube with the remaining 1 mL of the collagenase-dispase-CaCl2.\nIncubate the tissue at 37 °C up to 30 - 40 min. Move the muscle tissue by gently agitating the tube every 5 - 10 min.\nCoat the pipettes with media to avoid the adhesion of the released cells to the plastic walls of the pipettes. Add 2 volumes of sterile Growth Medium, e.g., 4 mL of DMEM 20% FBS (Fetal Bovine Serum), 1% L-glutamine and 1% P/S (Penicillin-Streptomycin), to stop the digestion.\nPipet up and down several times with a 5 mL pipette to help the release of the cells from the muscle fibers.",
    "NOTE: The sample is usually completely dissociated due to its small size. However, if fragments of muscle still remain, use a second incubation with the remaining pieces of muscle and with fresh enzymatic solution.\nFilter the muscle solution through a 70 µm cell strainer over a 50 mL conical tube. Wash the remaining cells with more media and filter through the strainer.\nCentrifuge at 443 x g for 5 min at RT to pellet the cells. Discard supernatant carefully.\nDissolve the pellet into F-12 media (Ham's F-12 Nutrient Mix), 20% FBS, 10% HS (Horse Serum), 1% P/S, 1% α-glutamine and 2.5 ng/mL of FGF-b (Recombinant human basic Fibroblast Growth Factor). Here, use 4 mL of media per 60 mm Petri dish.\n3. Seeding of Cells\nCollect the culture vessel previously coated with 10 µg/mL laminin from the incubator (section 1.1).\nCarefully remove the excess of laminin from the culture dish, and avoid touching the surface (or it will disturb the protein structure). Wash the culture dish with DPBS (optional).\nPlate the cells directly on the laminin coated vessel and incubate for 24 h in a humidified 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator.\nVisualize the cells under the bright-field microscope (100X total magnification) the following day. Round small cells attached to the surface and the remaining debris can be seen in the culture media.\nChange the media to fresh F-12 media complemented with 20% FBS, 10% HS, 1% P/S, 1% α-glutamine and 2.5 ng/mL of FGF-b.\n4. Culture and Passaging of Cells\nChange the media every 2 - 3 d and split the cells as soon as groups of cells are visible under the microscope (100X total magnification, example in Figure 2, cells from aged people, passage 0, after 7 d) in order to avoid spontaneous differentiation.",
    "At the first passage (P1), change the media to high-glucose DMEM complemented with 20% FBS, 10% HS, 1% P/S, 1% α-glutamine. Avoid using FGF-b from this point, as FGF is a potent mitogen and important factor at the beginning of the culture, but it can promote fibroblast overgrowth if used longer in culture.\nFor cell passaging:\n\t\nRemove the media and wash the cells twice with DPBS.\nAdd a minimum volume of 0.25% EDTA-trypsin to cover the surface of the cells. Rock gently to ensure all the cells are covered by the detachment solution, incubate for 10 seconds at room temperature, and remove it.\nIncubate the cells in a humidified 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 3 - 5 min. Tap gently and check under the bright light microscope (100X total magnification) that the cells are rounded but not completely detached from the surface. If no change is observed in the cells, incubate for 5 more min.\nAdd 5 mL of Growth Medium (high-glucose DMEM complemented with 20% FBS, 10% HS, 1% P/S, 1% α-glutamine) to collect the cells, mix well and transfer the cells with the new media into a T75 flask. Wash the remaining cells repeating this step with another 5 mL of Growth Medium (10 mL in total for one T75 flask).\nTo preplate (preferable at the first passage), incubate the cells in a humidified 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 40 min. Collect the supernatant with the cells that did not attach and incubate them in a new T75 flask. This should enrich the culture in myoblasts, as most of the fibroblasts should have attached in the first flask.\nChange the media every 2 - 3 d and split the cells 1 to 4 as soon as they reach 70% confluency for a maximum yield.",
    "For differentiation, once the cells reached 70 - 80% confluency, change the culture medium to Differentiation Medium (DM): high-glucose DMEM complemented with 2% HS, 1% P/S, 1% α-glutamine. The cells should be differentiated within 5 - 7 d depending on the quality and purity of the myoblast culture.\n5. Transfections Protocol\nSeed 50,000 cells/well in a 12-well plate for MF 20, senescence and viability assays. Culture cells on cover slips or in a dish coated with laminin. For Ki67 staining, seed 25,000 cells/well in a 12-well plate.\nFor transfections, follow the manufacturer's procedure using 5 µL of transfection reagent, 100 nM of control microRNA mimic or inhibitor, 100 nM of microRNA mimic or 100 nM of microRNA inhibitor per well, with a total volume of 1 mL.\nChange to Differentiation Medium 6 h after transfection (high-glucose DMEM complemented with 2% HS, 1% P/S, 1% α-glutamine). For proliferation experiments, stain the cells 2 d after transfection; for senescence, 7 d after transfection; and for MF20 staining, seven days after transfection.\n6. Immunostaining of the Cells\nKi67, MyoD and MF 20 immunostaining\n\t\nPrepare block 1 (10% HS and 0.1% Triton-X in PBS) and block 2 (10% HS and 0.05% Triton-X in PBS) solutions. Use 500 µL of reagent per well for a 12-well plate.\n\t\tNOTE: Perform the following steps using a shaker for the incubation steps.\nRemove the media from the cells.\nRinse the cells with PBS.\nFix the cells with cold methanol for 10 min on a rocker.\nRemove the methanol from the cells and rinse 3x with PBS for 5 min each time.\nAdd block 1 solution and incubate the cells on a rocker at RT for 1 h.",
    "Add primary antibody solution: for Ki67 staining, use Rabbit mAb to Ki67 (1:1,000 dilution in block 2); for MyoD, use MyoD1 (D8G3) XP Rabbit mAb (1:100 dilution in block 2); for MF 20 staining, use MYH1E (MF 20) primary antibody (DSHB, 1:1,000 dilution in block 2).\nIncubate the cells with the primary antibody for 1 h (RT) to O/N (4 °C) on a rocker.\nCollect the primary AB (it can be re-used several times if stored at 4 °C).\nRinse the cells 3x with PBS, 5 min each time.\nAdd the appropriate secondary antibody: for Ki67 or MyoD staining, goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (1:1,000 dilution in PBS); for MF 20 staining, goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (1:1,000 dilution in PBS).\nWrap the plate containing the cells and incubate secondary antibody for 2 h in the dark on a rocker at RT.\nRinse the cells 3x with PBS for 5 min each time.\nAdd DAPI solution (1:1,000 dilution in PBS) onto the cells and incubate on the rocker at RT for 5 - 10 min.\nRinse the cells 3x with PBS for 5 min each time.\nAdd 1 mL of fresh PBS.\nMount the cells on the cover slips in mounting solution or seal the plate containing the cells in PBS with Parafilm to avoid evaporation.\nStore at 4 °C.\nVisualize the cells with the fluorescence microscope as soon as possible (no later than 2 weeks).\nViability assay\nRemove the media from the cells.\nRinse the cells in PBS.\nAdd 1:1,000 ethidium bromide and 1:1,000 acridine orange diluted in PBS.\n\t\tCaution: Take care and work within health and safety regulations — ethidium bromide is a carcinogen.",
    "Wrap the plate containing the cells in staining solution and incubate at RT on the rocker for 5 min.\nTake images of the cells with the fluorescence microscope: green channel for acridine orange; red channel for ethidium bromide."
