  "procedures": [
    "All procedures were performed according to the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the use of experimental animals and followed institutional guidelines (Landesamt für Verbraucherschutz, Zentralstelle Amtstierärztlicher Dienst, Saarbrücken, Germany).\n1. Preparation of Surgical Instruments and Implants\nSelect a scalpel blade (size 15), a small swab, fine forceps, a 27 G needle, a non-resorbable 5-0 suture, scissors and a needle holder from the microsurgical instrument box.\nUnpack the intramedullary screw, the guide wire (0.3/0.2 mm diameter, 10 cm length), the centering drill bit (0.5 mm diameter) and the hand drill (Figure 1; see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: The intramedullary screw (0.5 mm diameter, 17.2 mm length) is made of medical-grade stainless steel for retrograde implantation into the femur. The screw has a proximal thread (0.5 mm diameter, 4 mm length) with a nose (0.2 mm diameter, 0.4 mm length) at the tip and distal cone-shaped head (0.8 mm diameter, 0.9 mm length) to achieve fracture compression as well as axial and rotational stability.\nExpose the implants and all surgical instruments to a disinfecting solution (96 % alcohol) for 5 min or sterilize them (steam sterilization, 130 °C, 25 min). After disinfection or sterilization, place the instruments on an operation cloth. Position the operation cloth directly adjacent to the small animal operation table.\n2. Animals, Anesthesia, and Analgesia\nChoose the strain, age, and sex of the mice according to the study question which is addressed.\n\tNOTE: For this study 12- to 14-week-old male CD-1 mice were used. The appropriate body weight to use the intramedullary screw is between 25-35 g.",
    "Anesthetize the mice with an intraperitoneal injection of 15 mg/kg xylazine and 75 mg/kg ketamine. Confirm the anesthetization by toe pinch. Apply eye lubricant to protect the animals' eyes from drying during anesthesia. After induction of anesthesia, place the mouse under a heat radiator to keep the body temperature constant. During the procedure, animals were monitored with repeated toe pinch to ensure an appropriate plane of anesthesia.\nApply tramadol-hydrochloride in the drinking water (1.0 mg/mL) for analgesia from day 1 before the surgery until day 3 after the surgery.\n\tNOTE: Analgesia and infection prevention should be in agreement with the respective guidelines of the country and institution where the experiments are to be performed.\n3. Surgical Procedure and Intramedullary Screw Implantation\nBefore surgery, shave the entire right hind leg and apply a depilatory cream. After 5 min, remove the cream and clean the leg with water. Then, apply a disinfecting solution with 96 % alcohol. Betadine or chlorhexidine can be added to the alcohol to ensure complete asepsis.\nUnder aseptic conditions, place the mouse in the supine position on the small animal operation table. Bend the right knee to allow for an anterior approach to the condyles of the knee. Perform a 5-mm medial parapatellar incision at the right knee using the scalpel blade.\nMobilize the patellar ligament carefully with the scalpel blade and the swab. Then, shift the patella laterally with the fine forceps to expose the intercondylar notch of the femur.\nOpen the intercondylar notch exactly in the middle of the femur between both condyles. Make sure not to exceed 1.0 mm in depth for the drill hole.",
    "Start manual drilling at a slow speed and a 45 ° offset ventrally to the femur axis using the 0.5 mm centering drill bit and the hand drill (Figure 1C and D, Figure 2). During drilling, continuously decrease the angle to 0 ° offset (parallel with the bone axis of the femur). Stop drilling when a depth of 1.0 mm is reached.\nAfter opening the bone at the intercondylar notch, insert the 27 G needle into the intramedullary cavity over the whole length of the femur. Ream the intramedullary cavity of the femur manually through rotary motions of the 27 G needle. Push the needle forward to perforate the cortical bone at the greater trochanter proximally.\nRemove the 27 G needle and apply the guide wire through the distal part of the femur.\n\t\nMake a skin incision with a scalpel blade (size 15) proximally over the guide wire and push the guide wire forward until both ends of the guide wire are outside. Make sure to keep the guide wire in place.\nCreate a defined closed fracture by using the guillotine.\n\t\nPlace the mouse in lateral position with the right leg under the guillotine. Make sure that the diaphyseal part of the femur is placed in the middle of the guillotine.\nDrop the weight (200 g) from the defined distance of 25.5 cm.\nControl the fracture configuration and fracture position as well as the position of the guide wire (Figure 3) using the x-ray device (see Table of Materials).\nConnect the intramedullary screw with the nose at the distal end to the 0.2 mm guide wire and insert it into the femur under continuous pressure, and clockwise rotation.\n\t\nShear of the drive shaft when the sufficient torque is achieved.\nRemove the guide wire proximally.",
    "Reposition the patella and fix the patella tendon to the muscles with one single suture using a 5-0 synthetic, monofilament, nonabsorbable polypropylene suture. Use single sutures of the same material and size to close the wound. Control the reduction of the fragments and the screw position radiologically using the x-ray device (see Table of Materials).\nKeep the animals under the heat radiator until they recover from anesthesia. Do not leave the animals unattended until they have regained sufficient consciousness to maintain ventral recumbency. Return the animals to single cages in the animal facility. Do not return the animals to the company of other animals during the first 24 h, even if they have fully recovered from anesthesia.\nMonitor the animals carefully every day. Maintain postoperative analgesia using tramadol-hydrochloride in the drinking water with a dosage of 1.0 mg/mL during the first three days. Continue analgesia if, on day 4 after surgery, the animals still show evidence of pain, as indicated by vocalization, restlessness, lack of mobility, failure to groom, abnormal posture, and lack of normal interest in surroundings. Terminate analgesia when the animals are pain-free.\nAt the end of the experiment euthanize the animal by an overdose of barbiturate.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
