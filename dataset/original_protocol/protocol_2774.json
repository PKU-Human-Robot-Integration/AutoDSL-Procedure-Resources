NK-92MI\n      cells are cultured in light-labeled and the MDA-MB-231 cells in\n      heavy-labeled SILAC media.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] Duration of cell culture\n      in SILAC media depends on two parameters: the labeling efficiency of\n      proteins and the quantity of cells needed to form a sufficient number of\n      cell-to-cell conjugates. The labeling efficiency for each cell type is\n      evaluated after five serial cell passages and should exceed 95% labeling.\n      If the labeling efficiency is not high enough, the cells should be\n      cultured over an extended period of time until the threshold of 95% is\n      reached.\n    \n      To optimize cell culture, the size of cell culture flasks is adjusted to\n      the number of cells necessary for coculture.\n    \n        NK-92MI cell culture.\n        \n            NK-92MI are cultured in 30 mL RPMI SILAC medium in 75 cm2\n            flasks and used after 5 passages if the labeling efficiency of the\n            cells exceeds 95%.\n            \nNote: add the isotope-labeled\n              amino acids freshly.\n            \n            Every 2–3 days, cells are counted to adjust the concentration at\n            3∗105 cells/mL (1 passage).\n          \n            To proceed with step 2: 105–106 cells are\n            sufficient for a preliminary test.\n          \nTo proceed with step 3: 3∗106 are sufficient.\n            To proceed with step 4: 35∗106 NK-92MI cells are\n            required.\n          \n        MDA-MB-231 cell culture.\n        \n            MDA-MB-231 are cultured in 20 mL DMEM SILAC medium in 175 cm2\n            flasks and used after 7 passages.\n            \nNote: add the isotope-labeled\n              amino acids freshly.\n            \n            At the confluence, cells are washed with PBS to remove the excess\n            medium.\n          \nAdd Trypsin-EDTA for 2 min.\n            Collect the detached cells by adding MDA-MB-231 SILAC-cell culture\n            medium.\n          \nSeed the cells at a 1/5 dilution (1 passage).",
