    "The L1000 Level 3 dataset can be downloaded and used to compute signatures for specific drugs and small molecules. This protocol describes the process of computing signatures from the Level 3 L1000 dataset using the Characteristic Direction (CD) method (Clark et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.487#cpz1487-bib-0004]).\nNecessary Resources\nHardware\nDesktop or a laptop computer, or a mobile device, with a fast Internet connection\nSoftware\nAn up-to-date web browser such as Google Chrome (https://www.google.com/chrome/[href=https://www.google.com/chrome/]), Mozilla Firefox (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/[href=https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/]), Apple Safari (https://www.apple.com/safari/[href=https://www.apple.com/safari/]), or Microsoft Edge (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge[href=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge])\nPython 3.8+ (https://www.python.org/downloads/[href=https://www.python.org/downloads/])\nA code editor, such as Microsoft Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/[href=https://code.visualstudio.com/])\nThe maayanlab-bioinformatics Python package (https://github.com/MaayanLab/maayanlab-bioinformatics[href=https://github.com/MaayanLab/maayanlab-bioinformatics])\nImporting L1000 data\n1. Download the following required files from the LINCS data releases app (https://clue.io/releases/data-dashboard[href=https://clue.io/releases/data-dashboard]). Save all files in the same directory as the processing script, if applicable.\n         \nL1000 metadata for Level 5 signatures (siginfo_beta.txt)\nL1000 metadata for Level 3 signatures (instinfo_beta.txt)\nL1000 gene metadata (geneinfo_beta.txt)\nL1000 Level 3 data (level3_beta_all_n3026460 × 12328.gctx).\nThe GCTX file format is an HDF5-based format for storing dense matrices; it is widely used for storing the CMAP data (Enache et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.487#cpz1487-bib-0009]). To better understand the different levels of L1000 data, please see the Critical Parameters section.\n2. Define the signature of interest by cell line, perturbagen name, perturbation time, and perturbation dose. For example, the cell line A549, the drug dexamethasone, the time point 24 hr, and the concentration 10 µM would constitute a single signature.\nPre-processing data",
    "3. Extract and store in separate tables the row names, column names, and data matrix from the Level 3 GCTX file. The row names are probe IDs that each correspond to a gene, while the column names are instance IDs corresponding to individual replicate instances of a perturbation. Each value in the 2-dimensional data matrix contains the quantile normalized expression level for a given gene in the given instance.\n4. Store the batch IDs for all signatures in the signature metadata file. The batch ID is simply the text that comes before the colon in each signature ID. For example, given the signature ID “AML001_CD34_24H:BRD-A03772856:0.37037”, the corresponding batch ID would be “AML001_CD34_24H”.\nFor more information on LINCS L1000 data naming conventions, please see the Critical Parameters section.\n5. Store the batch IDs for all perturbation instances in the instance metadata file by extracting the first three underscore-delimited terms from each sample_id. For example, given the sample ID “ERG013_VCAP_72H_X3_B11”, the batch ID would be “ERG013_VCAP_72H”.\nComputing signatures with the Characteristic Direction method\n6. Identify the signature of interest in the dataset by matching the cell line from step 2 to the cell_iname column, the perturbagen name to pert_iname, the timepoint to pert_itime, and the dose to pert_idose.\nIf multiple signatures from different batches match, perform the rest of this protocol for each signature individually.\n7. Use the distil_ids column to identify the instance IDs corresponding to the signature of interest, then slice those instances from the Level 3 GCTX file, which will be the “treatments”. Store the treatment matrix.",
    "8. Filter the instance metadata by the batch ID corresponding to the signature of interest, then remove the treatment instances. The remaining sample IDs consist of all other instances in the batch excluding those corresponding to the treatment, and these samples will serve as “controls”. Slice these instances from the Level 3 GCTX file, and store as the control matrix.\n9. Run the Characteristic Direction (CD) method on the treatment data and the control data. The method is implemented in several languages, and the code can be accessed from https://maayanlab.net/CD/[href=https://maayanlab.net/CD/]; however, the simplest way is to use the maayanlab-bioinformatics Python package (https://github.com/MaayanLab/maayanlab-bioinformatics[href=https://github.com/MaayanLab/maayanlab-bioinformatics]) that includes a Characteristic Direction function. The result is a vector in which each entry represents a gene and its associated CD coefficient (Clark et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.487#cpz1487-bib-0004]).\nNote that the order of the values in each instance is the same, and the order is preserved in the signature vector as well.\nObtaining differentially expressed genes from the signature\n10. Compute the 2-tailed z-scores and p-values for each coefficient in the CD results vector. Map the row IDs stored in step 3 to each coefficient and its p-value using the gene metadata file; the gene_id column provides the index of each gene in the vectors, and the gene_symbol column gives the common gene symbol corresponding to that index.\n11. Identify all genes that correspond to a CD coefficient GREATER than 0 and a p-value < the chosen alpha. These are the up-regulated genes in the signature.\n12. Identify all probe IDs that correspond to a CD coefficient LESS than 0 and a p-value < the chosen alpha. These are the down-regulated genes in the signature.",
    "BioJupies (Torre et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.487#cpz1487-bib-0030]) and the Bulk RNA-seq Appyter (Clarke et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.487#cpz1487-bib-0005]) are two web-based platforms developed by the LINCS DCIC to produce customized and interactive Jupyter notebooks for RNA-seq analysis. The BioJupies platform (Torre et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.487#cpz1487-bib-0030]) generates comprehensive Jupyter Notebook reports from user-inputted raw or processed RNA-seq data, including RNA-seq data fetched from GEO (Edgar et al., 2002[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.487#cpz1487-bib-0008]) and GTEx (GTEx Consortium, 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.487#cpz1487-bib-0014]). Each generated notebook report can be downloaded and shared. Each automatically generated notebook is stored persistently in the cloud and is made accessible via a unique URL. BioJupies contains several analysis tools that fall under four categories: exploratory data analysis, differential expression analysis, enrichment analysis, and small molecule query. The Bulk RNA-seq Appyter is also an online web-based application that provides an interface for users to upload processed RNA-seq count data files. Then, the Appyter automatically generates Jupyter Notebook–based reports that contain analysis and visualization of the uploaded data with principal component analysis (PCA), differential gene expression analysis, and L1000 small molecule search. The Appyter reports are similar to the analyses provided with BioJupies. Both have user-friendly interfaces for uploading and submitting data, selecting computational tools, and customizing tool parameters. This basic protocol demonstrates how to use these two platforms to analyze data from published RNA-seq gene expression studies, including querying the computed signature against the L1000 data for prioritizing small molecules that can reverse or mimic the expression of the input gene expression signatures.\nNecessary Resources\nHardware\nDesktop or a laptop computer, or a mobile device, with a fast Internet connection\nSoftware\nAn up-to-date web browser such as Google Chrome (https://www.google.com/chrome/[href=https://www.google.com/chrome/]), Mozilla Firefox (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/[href=https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/]), Apple Safari (https://www.apple.com/safari/[href=https://www.apple.com/safari/]), or Microsoft Edge (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge[href=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge])\nSubmitting data to BioJupies\n1a.

The fireworks display is an interactive scatter plot visualizing over 17,000 drug- and small-molecule-induced gene expression signatures as points in two-dimensional space. The L1000FWD map is useful for identifying mechanisms of action (MOA) for novel small molecules using unsupervised clustering, as well as for exploring drugs that may reverse or mimic an input signature of up and down genes. L1000FWD enables coloring of signatures by different attributes including cell type, concentration, and time point, as well as drug attributes including MOA and clinical phase. Each point on the L1000FWD interactive map is linked to a signature landing page, which provides multifaceted knowledge about the signature and the drug from various sources.

    "The LINCS Proteomic Characterization Center for Signaling and Epigenetics (PCCSE) examined the effects of small molecule and genetic perturbations on the proteome and epigenome (Litichevskiy et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.487#cpz1487-bib-0020]). Changes in phospho-signaling and chromatin states were measured using two liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) assays. The P100 assay measures the levels of 96 widely studied cell signaling peptides and phosphopeptides, which serve as a reduced representation of the signalome. The global chromatin profiling (GCP) assay measures post-translational histone modifications in bulk chromatin, which enables the generation of epigenetic signatures corresponding to various perturbations. These LINCS proteomics datasets are hosted on the PanoramaWeb (Sharma et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.487#cpz1487-bib-0025]) and CLUE.io platforms (Subramanian et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.487#cpz1487-bib-0028]).
