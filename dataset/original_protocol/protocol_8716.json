    "1. Preparation of Samples\nPreparation of solutions and set up\n\t\nMaintain all Drosophila melanogaster lines at 24 °C on standard food medium. Rear and keep them at low density in the vial to generate standardized size and weight of flies.\n\t\t\nAdd 10 virgin females with 10 males in a vial, let them mate and transfer them every 2 days to a fresh vial. Then 10 days later, when the flies start to eclose, harvest the flies every day. Keep a precise record of the age of the flies and keep them in good condition.\nAt day 3, separate the males from the females and keep the females 20 flies per vial. Record the flies at 4 or 5 days-old.\nPrepare Ringer’s solution with the following concentrations: 130 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, 5 mM HEPES, and 36 mM sucrose and adjust the pH of the solution to precisely 7.3. Prepare perfusion solutions of 25 µM nicotine and 100 mM KCl in Ringer’s solution.\nPrepare 1,000 µl pipette tip: using a razor blade shape tip to a slant (approximately 35° from end of tip) and remove excess base beyond 1 ½ centimeters from tip.\nPrepare box for storage (23 cm x 17 cm x 8.5 cm) of sample during incubation. Place two sponges (12 cm x 8 cm x 3 cm) saturated with water in bottom [to prevent sample desiccation] below a small rack apparatus to place samples on as their preparation is completed.\nPrepare flies samples so that they contain at least 1 copy of the UAS-GFP-aequorin and one copy of a Gal4 line to drive expression of GFP-aequorin. OK107 Gal4 line (a line driving expression primarily in the mushroom bodies) is crossed with UAS-GFP-aequorin in this preparation.",
    "NOTE: The inside of box must be waterproof and the outside must block light from entering box to prevent degradation of coelenterazine during incubation.\nPreparation of samples\n\t\nIce anesthetize Drosophila by transferring it to a glass vial and keep on ice for 2 min before being moved to the chilled Petri dish for positioning in the pipette tip. Prepare pipette tips on slightly dampened filter paper in 100 ml Petri dish on ice under the dissection microscope.\nGently with forceps place fly inside of pipette tip.\nUsing a brush gently push and align fly such that the head is completely past the edge of tip and the dorsal region is partially exposed by the section removed during tip shaping (Figure 2B).\nCombine a small (approximately 3-4 µl) portions of the two components of the dental glue. Apply the glue carefully around the front and back head and neck down to and around the pipet tip edge — avoiding the crown of the head. Let the glue dry for 2 min.\nPlace pipette tip with glued fly through hole in recording chamber (Figure 2D) and gently press to secure in place.\nCombine the two components of silicon glue (approximately 3-4 µl). Apply glue on the flat side of chamber along the edge where the chamber and pipette tip meet to prevent leak of the Ringer’s solution. Let the glue dry for 2 min.\nDissection\n\t\nAffix tape over the perfusion channel, short edge and extending to the back of the chamber.\nPlace chamber with fly on dissection block under microscope turn on fluorescent lamp. Pipet 1 ml of Ringer’s solution into chamber.",
    "Use fine surgical knife to remove cuticle. Make parallel incisions from the back of the head to antennal region. Then cut along the edge of eye then make a perpendicular incision above antenna connecting the previous incisions. Make a final incision parallel to that at the back of the head. Use the fine sharp forceps to remove cuticle (Figure 2C).\nUse fine sharp forceps to gently grasp and clear away exposed respiratory tissue until the brain and [fluorescing] mushroom body is clearly visualized.\nUse ultra-sharp forceps to carefully grasp and pinch neuroepithelial tissue covering brain to allow for permeation of the coelenterazine.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively papain can be used to permeabilize the neuroepithelia9.\nUsing a pipet, wash out twice with Ringer’s solution to remove any debris from dissection and place sample in the dark box.\nPipet 1 ml of Ringer’s solution containing 5 µM benzyl-coelenterazine into the chamber. Close the box and allow incubation with coelenterazine at RT for a minimum of 2 hr.\n2. Imaging\nSetup\n\t\nStart recording system: turn on microscope, computer, camera and drainage system and set room environmental controls to 25 °C.\nOpen Measurement and Automation Explorer program on the computer. Click on “Devices and Interfaces”, then double click on “NI Motion Devices” and finally right click on “PCI-7334” and select “initialize device”.\nOpen Photon Imager. Create new folder and name first recording file. Camera must reach -80 °C before system will function.\nSet up perfusion system — add KCl, nicotine, and Ringer’s solution to reservoirs and adjust so the each solution discharges at 2 ml/min. Wash with Ringer’s solution prior to starting experiment.\nPrepare sample\n\t\nPlace imaging mount block dish on mount under microscope at 5X magnification and insert perfusion tube into channel through puncture.",
    "Set microscope to fluorescent mode then center and bring mushroom bodies (MBs) into focus. Adjust to 20X and re-center and focus.\nPosition drainage apparatus over drainage pool, adjust height of the drainage shunt so that the tip is just above pool, and run Ringer’s solution for 30 sec to ensure adequate drainage.\nPull down shield to seal off apparatus from light. Using the automated system in photon imager make fine adjustments to the focus and take a reference fluorescent image of the MBs.\nRecording\n\t\nAdjust photon speed to desired recording speed (from 50 msec up to 1 sec or more). Select photon mode and open shutter. Record genotype, sex, age, and sample number in log entries. Adjust position ROI boxes over calyx and cell bodies (CCB) and medial lobes by clicking on the ROI boxes and dragging while holding control.\nRecord baseline for about 5 to 10 min (as desired).\nApply nicotine for 1 min. Note start/stop in log. Wash with Ringer’s solution for 5 min.\nWait 5 min for recovery and prepare KCl log entry and timer.\nApply KCl for 1 min. Note start/stop in log. Wash with Ringer’s solution for 1 min.\nSwitch to fluorescent mode, take final fluorescent image, and turn off Ringer’s solution.\nPress “Stop”. Dialog box will ask to shut off the system. Select “No” to continue recording.\nOpen shield, move drainage system, switch lens objective to 5X, remove perfusion tube. Remove sample/recording dish from stage, clean off 20X lens by rinsing and wiping the lens twice with water.\nPress the white play button at the top of the program window to initiate the next recording.\n3. Analysis and Video Creation\nExtract photon values\n\t\nOpen the photon analysis program (e.g., Photon Viewer) and open first sample spreadsheet file.",

Crop screenshots and paste image into a presentation slide for later analysis and comparison.\nAdjust both the “sec width” and “sec step” to the recording speed in seconds. Select length of analysis by moving grey markers on top panel to bracket region before stimulus initiation and just after response end.\nSelect “Suspend views while playing” press “<<REW” and press “PLAY>”. Select the tab “Count Rate Chart” and adjust units as desired and line colors to match ROI color.\nWhen analysis is finished, press “Export Count Rate Data”. Select screen shots of combined recordings CCB and medial lobe region of interest from each side. Crop screenshots and paste image into a slide with response images. This slide will be later used in final analysis.\nExample Analysis: one method for analysis of extracted photon data detailed\n\t\nOpen the spreadsheet files in “Count Rate Exports” folder.\nReformat the cells the first column labeled time to display the time in hour and minutes.\nReference the corresponding slide for the sample. Remove all values except the columns for the time and the two representative ROIs.\nDetermine nicotine stimulation start time — available in log entry file in main folder- remove additional data prior to start or highlight value.\nFind highest/ peak value for both CCB and medial lobe and mark/highlight.",
    "Determine response start and end time for both CCB and medial lobe by creating an estimate using time point from corresponding graphed response on slide and select actual value by change in values in proximity to these points. Highlight the region between these points in both the CCB and medial lobes. Alternatively, use a macro9.\nCombine all samples of one experimental group on a new spreadsheet.\nAlign on peak by determining the row value is for each CCB peak value. Subtract the lower values from the highest row value to determine approximate row value where that sample data must be recopied to. Verify that all peak values are aligned.\nCopy the sheet twice and delete either the medial lobe columns or the CCB columns creating pages of only CCB or medial lobe values.\nRemove data after the all CCB responses have ended. Create four rows labeled Total Photons, Response Length (duration), Peak Amplitude, and Response Latency. Copy and paste this again below the originals.\nUse the SUM function to determine total photons during response. Use the COUNT function to determine length of response. Copy and link highest value cell to determine peak amplitude value. Use COUNT function — select from the beginning of the perfusion of nicotine to the start of the response — to determine Response Latency.\nCopy values by using the linking function and multiply (all except peak amplitude) by recording speed in seconds.\nBar/box graphs may be created for calculated parameters such as Total Photons, Peak Amplitude, and Response Length, if so desired (ex.: Figure 5B, C, D).",
    "In the column after the raw data photon response, average the raw data points for each time point using average function. If desired follow with a column determining the standard error of the mean (SEM), for each of the averaged photon values at a time point.\nUse the average column to construct an average response profile [Graph] for the CCB sample group. To do this select the column specifying the time as the x-axis values and the column of the average photon values as the y-axis and finally select the scatterplot graph creation tool.\nRepeat this analysis procedure with the data from the medial lobes.\nCreating Images for the Video\n\t\nOpen photon viewer.\nSelect display control tab.
