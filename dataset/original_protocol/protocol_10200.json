    "1. Substrate Preparation\nAnnealing 1.4 x 1.1 cm Au(111) on Mica Substrates.\nPlace the Au(111) substrate on a glass-ceramic hob and anneal it with a butane flame for 3 min. Allow the substrate to cool under an argon atmosphere. Repeat this step for each Au(111) substrate.\n\t\tNOTE: Au(111) substrates should be used immediately after annealing.\nPreparation of Poly(L-Lactic Acid) (PLLA)-Coated Glass Substrates.\nCut and wash the glass slides.\n\t\t\nCut microscopy slides into 18 slides of 1.25 cm x 1.25 cm with a diamond-tip cutter. Make a small indentation on the lower side of each slide, so that the upper and lower sides can be later distinguished.\nWash the slides thoroughly with deionized water followed by 96% ethanol. Allow them to air-dry.\nPrepare the 2% PLLA solution.\n\t\t\nAdd 200 mg of PLLA to 10 mL of 1,4-dioxane in a pressure tube. Add a stir bar and close the tube tightly.\nPlace the pressure tube into a glycerin bath on a hot plate at 60 °C under gentle stirring for 24 h, and then transfer the solution to a 15-mL glass vial.\nCoating the glass slides with the PLLA solution.\n\t\t\nPlace the glass slides and the vial with the PLLA solution on a clean hot plate at 60 °C. Make sure to place the slides facing upward and allow them to remain for at least 10 min to reach the necessary temperature.\nPrepare the spin coater and set the program specified in Table 1.\nPlace one of the slides face up on the spin coater, using a vacuum system. With a Pasteur pipette, apply 0.25 mL of the PLLA solution to the slide, making sure that the whole surface is covered. Run the coating program. Repeat this step for each slide.\n2. Dendrimer Nanopatterning\nPreparation of RGD-Functionalized Dendrimer (RGD-Cys-D1) 28 Solutions.",
    "Dissolve 5 mg of the dendrimer in 6.494 mL of deionized water. This is solution A.\n\t\tNOTE: Use dendrimer stock solution within 6 months of preparation.\nSonicate solution A for 10 min and prepare solutions B and C following Table 2.\nSonicate solution C for 10 min and prepare solutions D, E and F following Table 2.\nStore solutions B, C, D, E and F at 4 °C until use. Solution A can be stored at -20 °C for later use.\nNanopatterning of RGD-Cys-D1 Dendrimers on the Substrates\nIn a tissue culture hood, sterilize the substrates by irradiating them with UV light for 13 min.\n\t\tNOTE: This step is only necessary when nanopatterned substrates are going to be used as cell culture substrates. In this case, maintain the sterile conditions (tissue culture hood, sterile materials, solutions and techniques) for the following steps.\nPlace each substrate face up in the wells of a plate, handling them carefully with tweezers.\nSonicate solutions B, C, D, E and F for 10 min.\nPass the RGD-Cys-D1 dendrimer solutions through a 0.22-µm diameter filter using a syringe directly in the wells containing the substrates (2 mL/well). At least three replicas per dendrimer concentration are recommended. Close and seal the plate and leave it at room temperature (RT) for 16 h.\nRemove and discard the solutions. Wash the substrates with sterile deionized water and dry. Store substrates at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\n3. Preparation of Control Substrates\nNote: All steps were performed in a sterile tissue culture hood, and only sterile materials, solutions and techniques were used. At least, six control substrates were used (three replicas of the positive control and three replicas of the negative control).",
    "In a tissue culture hood, sterilize the substrates by irradiating them with UV light for 13 min.\nControl Substrates for Fibroblast Adhesion Experiment.\nUse flame-annealed Au(111) substrates as the negative control. Gold has a well-known protein-denaturation effect that confers anti-cell adhesive properties28. Sonicate all solutions and filter prior to substrate incubation.\nFor the positive controls, immerse flame-annealed Au(111) substrates in a solution of RGD-modified PEG thiol, Ac-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Asp-NH-ethylene glycol mono-11-mercaptoundecanamide (RGD-PEG-SH)30 and triethylene glycol mono-11-mercaptoundecyl ether (PEG-SH) at a 1:100 molar ratio in 96% ethanol for 16 h at RT.\nWash substrates thoroughly in ethanol and dry them with argon. Store substrates at 4 °C.\nControl Substrates for Chondrogenesis.\nUse pristine PLLA substrates as the negative control. Without any surface treatment, PLLA shows poor interfacing with living cells.31\nFor the positive controls, prepare 5 mL of 0.1 mg/mL fibronectin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubate each PLLA substrate with 1.6 mL of the fibronectin solution for 1 h at RT.\nRemove and discard the fibronectin solution, and wash the substrates with PBS. Store substrates at 4 °C.\n4. Surface Characterization\nAFM Imaging\nPerform AFM imaging of PLLA substrates for a roughness analysis. Since dendrimers have a diameter of 4-5 nm, roughness values of 1 nm should be obtained for the proper visualization of the nanopatterns. Also, perform AFM imaging of the nanopatterns. In both cases, perform AFM in tapping mode in air.\nSelect a silicon cantilever with a spring constant k = 40 N/m and a resonant frequency ν = 300 kHz and mount it onto the AFM equipment.\nMount the sample on the stage of the atomic force microscope. Depending on the set-up of the apparatus, tuning and imaging specifications may vary. Consult the manufacturer's handbook.\nApproach the sample with the tip of the microscope until contact.",
    "To image PLLA for roughness analysis, select at least four representative areas of 20x20 µm per substrate from three independent substrates. To image dendrimer nanopatterns, choose at least three representative images of 5×5 µm per substrate from three independent substrates per condition (initial dendrimer concentration in solution). To avoid damaging the dendrimer layer while imaging, adjust the set point to keep the force at a minimum.\n\t\tNOTE: The choice of the imaging area also depends on the working range of the piezoelectric scanner. Please consult the instrument manual in this regard.\nProcess the AFM height images by fitting each scan line to polynomial leveling functions using the proprietary software of the manufacturer of the AFM apparatus, and analyze those from PLLA to calculate surface roughness. Root-mean square (RMS) analysis may provide a suitable option.\nLocal RGD Surface Density Measurement.\nObtain the image thresholds of the processed AFM height images to select the dendrimers on the surface.\nDetermine the particle positions using an image processing software and use them to obtain the minimum interparticle distances (dmin).\nPlot dmin values in z to the corresponding particle positions to obtain the probability contour maps for dmin. Adjust the color scale of the plot to visualize the regions of highest local RGD surface density (dmin < 70 nm).\nQuantify the area of the regions with the highest local RGD surface density using an image processing software. Include the areas of dendrimer aggregates in the calculation.\nSTM Imaging.\n\tNote: STM imaging can be performed only for nanopatterns on conductive Au(111) substrates. Measurements are done in air.\n\t\nPlace the nanopatterned substrate in the sample holder of the STM equipment. Check the electrical connection between sample and holder with a tester.",
    "Etch a tip of the selected probe material (i.e. Pt 0.8: Ir 0.2) with a diameter that ensures proper fitting on the head of the STM equipment. Etching can be performed either by manual cutting or by electrochemical etching.32\n\t\tNOTE: Electrochemical etching renders more symmetric tips.\nMount the tip in the head of the STM equipment and connect the sample.\nSet \"current\" in the feedback channel (in this type of measurement, current will be constant by feedback tuning). Adjust the bias voltage and current set point and scan size to obtain a well resolved image once the tip is engaged.\n\t\tNOTE: The choice of the imaging area also depends on the working range of the piezoelectric scanner. Please consult the instrument manual in this regard.\nProcess the STM topographical images by fitting each scan line to polynomial leveling functions using the proprietary software of the manufacturer of the STM apparatus.\nCA Measurements.\nMeasure CA on the nanopatterned substrates by the sessile-drop method at three different positions on three independent substrates per condition (initial dendrimer concentration in solution) with an optical CA system.\nFill the microsyringe with deionized water and set the parameters in the CA software to produce drops of 1 µL.\nPlace the sample on the stage so that the surface of the sample is clearly visible on the computer for imaging.\nMove the syringe with the micromanipulator until it gets close to the surface and dispense the drop onto the surface. Record the image immediately after droplet stabilization.\n\t\tNOTE: In CA measurements, it is very important to control humidity in order to achieve reproducible results.\nAnalyze the CAs measured with the proprietary software of the manufacturer of the CA apparatus. The fitting method can be adjusted to user requirements. The elliptic fitting method can be an option.",

    "Sample mounting for microscope observation: Using a diamond-tip cutter, cut coverslips into 1.25 cm x 1.25 cm. Apply 50 µL of microscopy mounting medium onto the samples and cover them gently with the cut coverslips.\nTransfer the samples to a convenient recipient, cover it with aluminum foil and store in the dark at 4 °C until observation.\n7. Cell Imaging and Data Analysis\nNOTE: For opaque Au(111) and thick microslide-based substrates, an upright microscope must be used.\nFibroblast Adhesion Experiment.\nUse an epifluorescence microscope equipped with a digital camera and low (i.e. 10X) and high (i.e. 40X) magnification objectives. Perform measurements in air.\nPlace the sample on the stage and image cell nuclei with the 10X objective using an ultraviolet excitation, longpass emission filter to visualize the Hoechst/DAPI stain.\nImage cell cytoskeleton and focal adhesions (FAs) with the 40X objective, selecting the microscope filter that matches the corresponding antibody fluorochrome specifications.\nFor FA quantification, use an image processing software to convert images to 8-bit files.

Normalize the area value obtained against the area of the corresponding condensate.\n8. Quantitative Reverse Transcription-polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) Analysis\nNOTE: To prevent RNase contamination, use disposable, sterile plastic ware and wear disposable gloves while handling reagents and RNA. Always use proper microbiological aseptic techniques and use an appropriate decontamination solution to remove RNase contamination from work surfaces and non-disposable items such as centrifuges and pipettes.\nIsolate total RNA and pulverize it in a RNA disrupter.
