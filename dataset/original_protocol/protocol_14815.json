    "NOTE: All mouse experiments were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (protocol #13032-34-01C). Animal care and experimental protocols adhered to Public Law 89-544 (Animal Welfare Act) and its amendments, Public Health Services guidelines, and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (U.S. Department of Health & Human Services).\n1. Infection\nObtain BALB/c mice of both sexes between the ages of 10-12 weeks of age.\n\tNOTE: S. pneumoniae serotype 4 strain TIGR4 is a virulent clinical isolate that has been sequenced16.\nGrow TIGR4 in Todd-Hewitt broth at 37 °C in 5% CO2 until reaching an optical density (OD)620 of 0.5 (corresponding to 1.0 x 108 colony forming units [CFU]/ml). Pellet the pneumococcal culture by centrifugation for 10 min at 3,500 x g and remove the supernatant using a vacuum line. Suspend and dilute bacteria with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to a final concentration of 1.0 x 104 CFU/ml.\nUsing an induction chamber, anesthetize mice with 2.5% vaporized isoflurane in oxygen. Confirm anesthetized state by gentle toe pinch with blunt tweezers.\n\t\nHolding the anesthetized mouse by its scruff and upright with one hand, inject each mouse intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 100 µl of the S. pneumoniae suspension using a syringe with a 27-30 gauge needle (corresponding to a challenge dose of 1.0 x 103 CFU). Place the mouse back in its cage. Mice typically awaken 30-40 sec after injection.\nAllow the infection to proceed for at least 24 (early) or 30 (advanced) hr.\n\t\nEuthanize the mice by CO2 asphyxiation. Perform cervical dislocation to ensure mouse has deceased. Euthanasia is further confirmed by removal of the heart in Step 1.6.",
    "Disinfect the tail with an alcohol swab and snip a 2-3 mm section. Collect 2 µl of blood and serially dilute the blood 10-fold in PBS containing sodium heparin 1 U/ml five times. Plate serial dilutions on a tryptic soy blood agar plate and incubate overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The next day extrapolate from colony counts the level of bacteremia.\nImmobilize the mouse in a supine position on a surgical platform. Spray the chest with 70% ethanol and pat dry. Using surgical scissors and forceps open the chest cavity, remove the rib cage, and transect the diaphragm to expose the heart and lungs. Using scissors cut the blood vessels connected to the heart and gently excise the heart with care to avoid bruising with forceps.\nRinse the heart with PBS and then place into tissue specimen collection cassettes such that coronal sections would be obtained during tissue sectioning. For paraffin embedding, place the cassettes in 10% buffered-formalin solution and the next day send for paraffin embedding.\n\t\nAlternatively flash freeze using O.C.T. Compound within a cryomold that has been placed on dry ice.\n2. Visualization of Cardiac Lesions and Pneumococci within Lesions\nCut down paraffin-embedded heart sections such that the 4 chambers of the heart are visible in each tissue section. Cut slides at thickness of 5 µm.\nDeparaffinize and stain slides with hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) using standard methods17.\nView H&E stained cardiac sections using a light microscope at low (100X, 200X) and high (oil immersion: 400X, 1,000X) magnifications. Characterize hearts for the presence of microlesions in the myocardium. Here, acquire H&E images using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 microscope equipped with a 100X 1.3 numerical aperture Plan-NEOFLUAR objective.",
    "NOTE: At early stages cardiac lesions are discriminated by their differential colored appearance and in some instances the presence of immune cells (monocytes and granulocytes) what appear to be monocytes. In advanced lesions, particularly those seen at 30 hr, immune cells are absent and large vacuole-like lesions are observed in their place. It is important to note that while immune cell influx during the early stages of cardiac lesion development can occur it does not appear to be a requirement.\n3. Immunofluorescent Microscopy for Pneumococci within Microlesions\nSection heart in cryomolds with microtome to a thickness of 5 μm and place sections onto positively charged glass slides. Allow frozen cardiac sections to thaw and air dry. Fix sections for 10 min in 10% neutral buffered formalin (pH 6.8-7.2 at 25 °C).\nWash slides (3x) in PBS for 5 min, permeabilize for 15 min in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, then wash again in PBS.\nBlock tissue section on slides with 10% goat serum in PBS for 1 hour.\nRinse slides with PBS, cover and incubate cardiac sections with rabbit anti-serotype 4 pneumococcus antiserum at 1:1,000 in PBS with 10% goat serum for 2 hr at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: For negative controls investigators should use naive rabbit antiserum\nAfter washing with PBS, cover and incubate sections with 10% goat serum-PBS with goat anti-rabbit FITC conjugated antibody at 1:2,000 for 30 min at 37 °C.\nFollowing the manufacturer’s instruction, use DAPI (4',6- Diamidino-2-Phenylindole) at 5 mg/ml for visualization of eukaryotic nuclei. Wash and mount tissue sections with FluorSave.\nAcquire fluorescent images using a confocal microscope system at both low and high magnification. Adjust the numerical aperture accordingly to obtain optimal results. Here, acquire fluorescent images using a confocal system with a 60X 1.42 numerical aperture objective.\n4. Antibiotic Rescue of Septic Mice",
    "Begin with mice infected i.p. with 1.0 x 103 CFU of TIGR4 as previously indicated in step 1.\nBeginning at 30 hr post-infection, administer pharmaceutical grade ampicillin i.p. (80 mg/kg body weight) in 100 µl saline every 12 hr for 36 hr. Collect hearts at the desired time point and process as described in step 1.6 for paraffin embedding and tissue, sectioning.\n5. Collagen Deposition Detection\nUsing xylene and graded alcohol washes with deionized water, deparaffinize and hydrate tissue sections using standard methods17. Treat sections with aqueous 0.2% phosphomolybdic acid for 5 min and rinse with deionized water for 5 min.\nStain sections with 0.1% Sirius Red in picric acid for 2 hr at room temperature.\nWash sections in 0.01 N hydrochloric acid for 3 min and rinse using 70% ethanol for 1 min.\nDehydrate the sections using the identical but reverse order of washes to that outlined in 5.1, dehydrate cardiac sections in increasing and graded concentrations of ethanol then xylene.\nMount tissue sections with a mounting solution for microscopic evaluation.\nTo identify regions of collagen deposition, examine stained tissue sections for areas of deep read staining under low and high magnification using a light microscope. Any area within the ventricles of the heart that is red is an area where collagen has been deposited. Areas without this red stain are sites of healthy tissue lacking collagen deposition. Herein, acquire Picro Sirius Red stained images using a microscope equipped with a 20X 0.5 numerical aperture objective.\n\tNOTE: The atrium stains red in healthy tissues.\nSubscription Required.
