    "1. Cell culture work of Ntera/CL2.D1 to prepare a co-culture of post-mitotic hNeurons and hAstrocytes (NT2-N/A)\nNOTE: This is the component of the Minibrain (Figure 1).\nCulturing the Ntera/Cl2.D1\n\t\nRemove a vial of frozen cells from liquid nitrogen tank. Keep on ice.\nThaw the cells rapidly in a 37 °C water bath.\nTransfer the cells in a 15 mL tube containing 10 mL of complete DMEM F12 medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium: Nutrient Mixture F-12 medium) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM glutamine, 100 IU penicillin and 100 µg streptomycin (i.e., complete DMEM F12 medium).\nCentrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min at room temperature (RT). Dissociate the pellet in 2 mL of complete DMEM F12 medium.\nTransfer in a T75 tissue culture flask in polystyrene with specific treatment for sensitive adherent cells (T75Cell+) containing 13 mL of complete DMEM F12 medium.\nCulture cells in an incubator maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity until 90% confluence (i.e., around 5 days). Change medium every 2-3 days.\nSubculturing the Ntera/Cl2.D1 and amplification\n\t\nRemove the medium from the flask.\nRinse the cell monolayer with 10 mL of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) supplemented with Ca2+ and Mg2+.\nRinse the cell monolayer with 10 mL of EDTA solution (kept at RT).\nAdd 3 mL of trypsin-EDTA solution (0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA) and incubate 2 min at RT.\nShake the flask and make sure the cells are detached from the plastic surface.\nAdd 10 mL of complete DMEM F12 medium to inactivate the trypsin, transfer in a 15 mL tube and centrifuge for 5 min at 200 x g at RT.\nDissociate the pellet with 10 mL of complete medium and use 1 mL to inoculate each new flask containing 14 mL of complete DMEM F12 medium.",
    "NOTE: Thirty T75 Cell+ flasks are required for each differentiation.\nIncubate the flasks at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity until 90% confluence.\nDifferentiation of NTera/Cl2.D1 in human neuron-astrocyte co-culture\n\tNOTE: This is the main component of the Minibrain.\n\t\nAt Day 0, dissociate the cells with trypsin-EDTA as described in step 1.2 and dissociate the cell pellet of each flask with 2 mL of complete DMEM F12 medium.\nAdd 1 mL of the cell suspension (corresponding to 5 x 106 cells) in 60 plastic Petri dishes of 85 mm diameter containing 11 mL of complete DMEM F12 medium.\n\t\tNOTE: The cells will not attach to the plastic and will aggregate to form pseudo neurospheres (see photograph in the lower panel of Figure 1). Incubate the 60 Petri dishes at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity for one day.\nAt Day 1, add 1 mL of complete DMEM F12 medium supplemented with 130 µM of all-Trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA) per Petri dish (final concentration ATRA 10 µM) and return the dishes at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity for 24 h.\nAt Day 2, transfer very carefully the medium containing cell spheres of each Petri Dish in a 50 mL tube and centrifuge for 10 min at 50 x g and RT. Dissociate carefully the loose pellet with 13 mL of complete DMEM F12 medium supplemented with 10 µM ATRA and add the 13 mL in a new 85 mm diameter Petri dish.\n\t\tNOTE: Over the different passages, it is extremely important to maintain the spheres density as high as the density obtained at Day 2 (i.e., around a density of 70%). Therefore, if the sphere density is lowering, reduce the total number of Petri dishes according to the number of cells.",
    "Repeat the procedure above (step 1.3.4) at days 4, 6 and 8.\nAt Day 10, repeat the procedure above but add the spheres to the T75 Cell+ flasks instead of Petri dishes. Add the cells from one Petri dish to one T75 Cell+ flask.\nAt Days 11, 13, 15 and 17, change the used medium with 14 mL of complete DMEM F12 supplemented with 10 µM ATRA.\nAt Day 19, change medium with 14 mL of complete DMEM F12 medium without ATRA per flask.\nAt Day 20, dissociate gently the cells with trypsin/EDTA as follows.\n\t\t\nFor each T75 Cell+ flask, rinse the cells with 10 mL of PBS supplemented with Ca2+ and Mg2+; incubate the cells with 4 mL of EDTA for 5 min at RT.\nRemove carefully the EDTA and add 2 mL of trypsin-EDTA and incubate 7 min at RT. Shake very gently the flask and add carefully 8 mL of complete DMEM F12 medium.\nCentrifuge 10 for min at 160 x g and RT. Dissociate the cell pellet in 13 mL of complete DMEM F12 medium and transfer in a T75 Cell+ flask.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The very gentle dissociation with trypsin-EDTA will allow recovering the ATRA differentiated cells from the original teratocarcinoma cells, which are strongly attached to the plastic ware.\nAt Day 21, remove the medium and the dead cells. Add 14 mL of complete DMEM F12 medium supplemented with 5% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, 100 IU penicillin, 100 µg streptomycin and 0.5 µM of AraC (Cytosine β-D-arabinofuranoside) (complete 5% FBS DMEM F12-AraC).\nAt Days 23, 25 and 28, replace used medium with 14 mL of 5% FBS DMEM F12-AraC.",
    "At Days 29 up to 49 (every two days), replace used medium with 14 mL of complete DMEM F12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 IU penicillin, 100 µg streptomycin, 5 µM of FudR (5-fluoro-2’deoxyuridine) and 10 µM Urd (Uridine) (complete 5% FBS DMEM F12-FudR-Urd).\nAt Day 50, replace used medium with 14 mL of complete DMEM F12 medium supplemented with 5% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, 100 IU penicillin, 100 µg streptomycin and 10 µM Urd (complete 5% FBS DMEM F12-Urd).\nAt Days 51 up to 95 (twice a week), replace used medium with 14 mL of complete 5% FBS DMEM F12-Urd.\n\t\tNOTE: Cells can be used for experiments from day 51 but not later than day 95. The use of serial treatments with mitosis inhibitors allows recovering pure population of co-culture of post-mitotic hNeuron and hAstrocytes (NT2-N/A).\nTo seed the cells, proceed with gentle trypsinization as described for Day 20.\n2. Cell culture work of human microglial cells CHME/Cl5\nNOTE: This is the microglial component of the Minibrain (Figure 1).\nCulturing the human microglial cells CHME/Cl5\n\t\nRemove a vial of frozen cells from the liquid nitrogen tank. Keep on ice.\nThaw rapidly in a 37 °C water bath.\nTransfer the cells in a 15 mL tube containing 10 mL of complete DMEM F12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 IU penicillin and 100 µg streptomycin (i.e., complete 5% FBS DMEM F12 medium).\nCentrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min at RT. Dissociate the pellet with 2 mL of complete 5% FBS DMEM F12 medium.\nTransfer in a T75 Cell+ flask containing 13 mL of complete 5% FBS DMEM F12 medium.\nCulture cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity until 90% confluence. Change medium every 2-3 days.",
    "Subculturing the human microglial cells CHME/Cl5\n\t\nRemove medium from the flask.\nRinse the cell monolayer with 10 mL of PBS supplemented with Ca2+ and Mg2+.\nRinse the cell monolayer with 10 mL of EDTA solution (kept at RT).\nAdd 3 mL of trypsin-EDTA solution and incubate 2 min at RT.\nShake the flask and make sure the cells are detached from the plastic surface.\nAdd 10 mL of complete 5% FBS DMEM F12 medium to inactivate the trypsin, transfer in a 15 mL tube and centrifuge for 5 min at 200 x g and RT.\nDissociate the pellet with 10 mL of complete medium and use 1 mL to inoculate each new flask containing 14 mL of complete 5% FBS DMEM F12 medium.\nIncubate the flasks at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity until 90% confluence.\n3. Culture work with the hCMEC/D3 to coat porous inserts and prepare BBB\nCulturing the human endothelial cells hCMEC/D3 (Figure 2)\n\t\nDilute the type I rat Collagen to 1:30 with pure sterile water (cell culture grade).\nTransfer 10 mL into a T75 Cell+ flask and incubate 2 h in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity incubator.\nRemove the collagen solution and replace it with 15 mL of endothelial cell medium supplemented with 10 mM of HEPES (referred as complete endothelial cell medium).\nRemove a cryo vial of cells from the liquid nitrogen tank. Keep on ice.\n\t\tNOTE: The cells were grown, and a seed lot was made as described by the manufacturer. The cell line is covered by a biological material transfer agreement. The cells are obtained at passage number 25 and should not be used further than passage 35.\nThaw rapidly in a 37 °C water bath.",
    "Transfer the cells in the T75 Cell+ flask and return the flask at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity for 2 to 4 h.\nRemove the medium carefully without losing or removing cells. Rinse the cells once with 10 mL of complete endothelial cell medium.\nAdd 15 mL of complete endothelial cell medium.\nCulture cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity until 100% confluence (not less than 4 days) without changing the medium.\nSubculturing the hCMEC/D3 to prepare the insert of the BBB\n\t\nCoat a new T75 Cell+ flask or inserts with the type I Rat Collagen as described above (step 3.1).\nRemove the medium from the flask. Rinse the cell monolayer with 10 mL of PBS supplemented with Ca2+ and Mg2+.\nAdd 2 mL of trypsin-EDTA solution and incubate 5 min at 37 °C.\nShake the flask and make sure that the cells are fully detached from the plastic surface.\nAdd 4 mL of complete endothelial cell medium to inactivate the trypsin.\nWith a 5 mL plastic pipette, mechanically dissociate the cells by aspirating and flushing the cell suspension while maintaining the 5 mL pipette to the bottom of the flask at least 5 times.\nCount the cells and use 5 x 104 cells/insert for a 12 well polyester membrane culture inserts insert and 2 x 106 cells for a T75 Cell+ flask. Prepare also three filters without cells for the PELy (i.e., endothelial cells permeability to Lucifer yellow see below paragraph 4.2) experiments with the Polyester membrane culture inserts.\nIncubate the flasks or inserts at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity until 100% confluence.",
    "Do not change the medium for T75 Cell+ flask until a new passage. On the contrary for BBB on polyester membrane culture inserts: change medium at days 2 and 4, use the BBB for experiments at day 6.\n4. Construction and quality control of the BBB-Minibrain (Figure 2)\nSetting up a BBB-Minibrain Polyester membrane culture insert device (Figure 2B)\n\t\nGrow the hCMEC/D3 cells on 12 well Polyester membrane culture insert filters for 6 days on endothelial cell medium before using them for the experiment.\nCoat a 12 well plate with poly-D-lysine (1 mL/well, 10 µg/mL, 4 h at RT) and then laminin (1 mL/well, 1 µg/mL, overnight at RT).\nRemove laminin and add 1 mL of endothelial cell medium supplemented with 5% FBS (5% endothelial cell medium).\nIncubate for 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity.\nGently trypsinize the NT2-N/A (as described in step 1.3.9) and CHME/Cl5 (as described in step 2.2) and dissociate the cell pellets with complete endothelial cell medium.\nCount the cells, mix 3.6 x 105 NT2-N/A and 0.4 x 105 CHME/Cl5 cells/well and seed the 12 well plate.\nAt T=24 h (24 h after seeding): change the used medium with fresh complete endothelial cell medium (Minibrain cells and endothelial cells) and transfer the hCMEC/D3 Polyester membrane culture insert filter on the top of the Minibrain cells. Incubate the BBB-Minibrain at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity.\n\t\tNOTE: The BBB-Minibrain will then consist of a layer of human endothelial cells hCMEC/D3 on filter isolating the luminal compartment (or “blood” compartment) and of a mixed culture of human cells hNT2-N/A and hCHME/Cl5 (Minibrain) at the bottom of the well defining the abluminal compartment (or “brain” compartment) (Figure 2B).\nValidation of the endothelial permeability of the BBB-Minibrain (Quality Control) (Figure 2C)",
    "Prepare the transport buffer (TB), which is HBSS (Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution) buffer with Ca2+ and Mg2+ supplemented with 10 mM HEPES and 1 mM sodium pyruvate.\nPrepare 12 well plates with 1.5 mL of transport buffer per well.\nAt T= 0, make fresh transport buffer supplemented with 50 µM Lucifer Yellow (LY-TB).\nReverse each filter upside down to remove carefully the medium without affecting the endothelial cell barrier.\nPlace the filter on the filled 12 well plate and add 0.5 mL of LY-TB.\nIncubate the plates in an incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity.\nAt T=10 min transfer the filters on new TB filled 12 well plates and keep the abluminal compartment of the first plate for OD reading.\nAt T= 25 min, repeat the step 4.2.7.\nAt T= 45 min, stop the transport by removing the filters from the plates. Keep abluminal and luminal compartments for OD measures.\nTransfer in a dark 96 well plates the samples: 10 µL with 190 µL TB for the LY-TB and the luminal compartments, 200 µL of sample for the abluminal compartments.\nMeasure the fluorescence of the LY-TB present in the different samples at λ428 nm λ535 nm (excitation and emission length waves respectively).\nCalculate the endothelial permeability (Pe) toward LY-TB (PeLY) according to Siflinger-Birnboim, A et al. (1987)39 and Da Costa, A et al. (2018)34 by using the formula:\n\t\t1/PSe= (1/PSt) – (1/PSf) and PeLY= PSe/S.",
    "NOTE: PSf is the permeability of the filter without cells, PSt is the permeability of the filter with cells, PSe is the permeability of the endothelial monolayer time the surface of the monolayer, S is the surface of the monolayer (for a 12 well filter=1.12 cm2), PeLY is expressed in cm/min. For hCMEC/D3 the PeLY should be between 0.7 and 1.2 x 10-3 cm/min depending mainly of the FBS used in the experiments. Important: a PeLY higher than 1.2 means that the BBB is not tight enough and some leakage can be observed. Discard these barriers.\n5. Use of BBB-Minibrain to highlight the presence of neuro-invasive viral particles in a Yellow Fever Virus vaccine sample, the French Neurotropic virus, YFV-FNV 34 (Figure 3)\nBBB crossing and multiplication of Yellow fever viruses in the Minibrain\n\t\nUse the BBB-Minibrain prepared as described in step 4.1.7 24 h before the addition of the virus; replace the medium by 2% FBS endothelial cell medium.\n\t\tNOTE: It is extremely important to avoid changing the medium just before adding the virus. Changing the medium can activate the human endothelial cells and transiently open the barrier which will allow the passage of the virus. Here the medium is changed 24 h before starting the experiment.\nAt T= 0, add 3500 Plaque Forming Units (PFU) of YFV-FNV diluted in 50 µL of 2% FBS endothelial cell medium very carefully on the top of the luminal compartment. The control BBB-Minibrain is inoculated with 50 µL of 2% FBS endothelial cell medium without virus. Determine PeLY on companion well.\nIncubate the BBB-Minibrain in an incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity.",
    "After 24 h, remove the polyester membrane culture inserts filter device and determine PeLY, sample 1 mL from the abluminal compartment and titrate the virus as described by A. da Costa et al. (2018)34. Replace the medium with fresh 2% FBS endothelial cell medium.\nIncubate the BBB-Minibrain at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity.\nAfter 72 h, sample the medium from the abluminal compartment and titrate the virus, and/or extract the RNA from the Minibrain cells for gene expression analysis as described by A. da Costa et al. (2018)34.\nAmplification of neurotropic variants of YFV-FNV on Minibrain cells by serial passages\n\t\nUse Minibrain cells coated 12 well plates (i.e., steps 4.1.6 and 4.1.7).\nAt time point 0 h, add 3,500 Plaque Forming Units of YFV-FNV diluted in 50 µL of 2% FBS endothelial cell medium very carefully on the top of the cells (luminal compartment).\nAfter 1 h, remove the medium with the virus inoculum and replace with fresh 2% FBS endothelial cell medium.\nAfter 48 h, sample 500 µL of the culture medium and infect fresh Minibrain cells\nAfter 120 h, sample 500 µL of the culture medium and infect fresh Minibrain cells.\nAfter 192 h, save culture medium (=virus stock enriched) and extract the RNA from the Minibrain cells for gene expression analysis as described by A. da Costa et al. (2018)34.\n6. Use of BBB-Minibrain to study BBB crossing and brain cell targeting of a biomolecule\nTransport across the BBB of a neuron targeting biomolecule\n\t\nUse the Minibrain-BBB prepared as described step 4.1.7.\nAt time point 0 h, add the biomolecule (In the example provided in the result section, 58.75 ng/BBB of the cell permeant NeuroTag-NV molecules were added per BBB-Minibrain insert.\nIncubate the BBB-Minibrain at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity.",
    "After 24 h, remove the polyester membrane culture inserts filter device and determine PeLY, then stain the Minibrain cells for hNeurons neurofilament Nf200 and detect the presence of the biomolecule in the Minibrain (In the example provided in the result section, NeuroTag-NV was detected using an antibody directed against the Strep-Tag it contains35,40).\nTransport across the BBB of a neuroregenerative biomolecule and subsequent neuroprotective assay in the Minibrain after the biomolecule has crossed the BBB\n\t\nUse the Minibrain-BBB prepared as described in step 4.1.7.\n\t\tNOTE: For molecules targeting neurons only, Minibrain cells can be replaced by the Neurons cells (NT2-N) only38.\nAt time point 0 h, add 58.75 ng/BBB-Minibrain well of the cell permeant NV molecules (active form CPM-NeuroTag-NV, non-active form CPM-NeuroTag-NVΔ) described by C. Prehaud et al. (2014)35.\nIncubate the BBB-Minibrain in an incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity.\nAfter 4 h, make individual wounds with an injection needle (26GX1/2”, 12-4.5, Terumo, Belgium) on the Minibrain cells. Make at least 10 scratches on each individual well. Determine PeLY on the companion well.\nIncubate the BBB-Minibrain in an incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity.\nAfter 8 h, replace the medium in the abluminal compartment by fresh complete endothelial cell medium.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important to replace the medium at this step since the wounding of the Minibrain cells can lead to cell death and then the release of cytotoxic compounds.\nIncubate the BBB-Minibrain in an incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity.\nAfter 48 h, stained the cells for axon regeneration of hNeurons as described by C.
