    "1. Animals\nMice (C57/BL6) of ages 1, 9, and 13 months old were obtained from the Animal Resources Centre (Perth, Australia). These mice were housed in standard mouse cages in the Bosch Rodent Facility at the University of Sydney on a 12/12 hr light/dark cycle with access to food and water ad libitum. The procedures outlined below were approved by the University of Sydney Animal Ethics Committee.\nBring mouse cages into the testing room prior to each test for 10 min to allow mice to acclimatize to the testing environment.\n2. Rotarod\nSet up the rotarod apparatus (Figure 1A):\n\t\nInstall the dowels in each lane of the rotarod.\n\t\tNote: In this instance rat dowels (70 mm in diameter) are used instead of mouse dowels (32 mm in diameter) to discourage the mice from clinging to the dowel and performing “passive rotations”10.\nPosition the magnetic landing platforms on the wire situated at the bottom of each lane of the rotarod making sure that they are not tilting to touch the floor of the rotarod and are placed as close as possible to the magnetic right wall of each lane without touching.\n\t\tNote: During rotarod testing mice are required to walk in a forward direction to stay on the rotating and accelerating dowels. When a mouse is no longer able to stay on the dowel, they fall and displace the landing platform that subsequently activates a magnetic sensor. The time taken to fall from the rotating dowel, the dowel rpm at time of falling and the distance traveled is automatically calculated for each mouse and recorded on the display screen at the front of the rotarod.\nSlide 2 clear plastic panels into the front of each rotarod lane with the shorter panels at the bottom and the longer panels above.",
    "Input the test parameters using the keypad located at the front of the rotarod. Follow steps 2.1.4.1 to 2.1.4.6 for the accelerating rotarod test parameters and steps 2.1.4.7 to 2.1.4.12 for the fixed speed rotarod test parameters.\n\t\t\nSet the maximum duration of the test to 60 sec.\nSet the number of lanes to be used (or the number of mice to be tested).\nSet the starting speed of the test to 5 rpm.\nSet the top speed of the test to 44 rpm.\nSet the ramp speed of the test to 60 sec.\nSet the size of the dowels chosen and the direction of rotation to rat dowels rotating in a forward direction.\nSet the maximum duration of the test to 240 sec.\nSet the number of lanes to be used to 1 as the mice are tested individually.\nSet the starting speed of the test to 15 rpm.\nSet the top speed of the test to 15 rpm.\nSet the ramp speed of the test to 0 sec.\nSet the size of the dowel chosen and the direction of rotation to a rat dowel rotating in a forward direction.\n\t\t\tNote: The settings above may be altered to suit the needs of different experiments.\nPlace a camera in front of the rotarod for the fixed speed rotarod test, so that the behavior of the mouse during trials can be recorded and the videos used for later analysis to determine the duration of time the mice were able to stay on the rotarod.\nFollow steps 2.2.1 to 2.2.4 for the accelerating rotarod test:\n\t\nPlace one mouse on each stationary dowel for 5 min to allow mice to acclimatize to the rotarod.",
    "Gently nudge the mice to face the back of the rotarod and start the rotarod test when all subjects are facing in this direction (see Figure 1B).\nReturn all mice to their cages when they have fallen from the rotating dowels and leave them to rest for 10 min with access to food and water.\nRepeat steps 2.2.1 to 2.2.3 to complete a total of 8 trials making sure to clean the dowels, lanes, and landing platforms of the rotarod for urine and feces, and move the landing platforms back to its starting position betwen each trial.\n\t\tNote: The first 3-5 trials are used as training trials to allow the mice to familiarize themselves with the task. The time to fall, distance walked and end rpm of the dowel at the time of the fall for each subsequent trial is recorded for later analysis (Figure 2).\nFollow steps 2.3.1 to 2.3.8 for the fixed speed rotarod test:\n\t\nPlace one mouse on a dowel for 5 min to allow it to acclimatize to the rotarod. Return the mouse back to its cage.\nStart video recording on the camera and press start on the rotarod. Then place the mouse on the rotating dowel ensuring it faces the back of the rotarod.\nStop video recording on the camera when the mouse falls from the rotating dowels, and return the mouse to its cages for 10 min with access to food and water.\nRepeat steps 2.3.2 and 2.3.3 until a total of 8 trials is acquired making sure to clean the dowels, lanes, and landing platforms of the rotarod for feces and urine, and move the landing platforms back to its starting position between each trial.",
    "Switch on the custom built rotator at 3 Hz for 20 sec to allow the mice to become familiar with the sound. Stop the rotator after 20 sec by switching off the drill and place hands on either side of the running wheel to stop it from continuing to spin past the initial 20 sec.\n\t\tNote: The rotator itself consists of a rodent running wheel secured to a drill (Figure 3A). At the center of the running wheel is a small chamber with a mesh lid where the mouse is placed (Figure 3B). The rotator spins in a counter-clockwise direction about the vertical axis. The magnitude of the stimulus is in line with previous studies that show rotary stimulations ranging from 0.2 to 3 Hz are sufficient to generate VOR and VCR responses4,11,12.\nPlace the mouse inside the chamber at the center of the rotator and replace the lid.\nSwitch on the rotator at its lowest setting of 3 Hz for 20 sec. Start the rotarod and begin video recording on the camera during this time in preparation for the upcoming trial. Switch off the drill at the end of the 20 sec and place hands on either side of the running wheel to stop it from spinning. Retest the mouse on the rotarod immediately after by transferring it as quickly as possible to the rotating dowel.\nStop video recording on the camera when the mouse falls from the dowel and return the mouse to its cage.\nClean the clear plastic panels with a mild detergent/water mix and the cylindrical dowels, lanes and metal landing platforms of the rotarod with 70% ethanol when all mice have been tested.\n3. Balance Beam with Vestibular Challenge\nSet up the balance beam apparatus as seen in Figure 4A.",
    "Note: The balance beam apparatus was adapted from an apparatus described in Carter et al. (2001)13. For this test, mice walk from the lower end of the beam, which is 52.5 cm above the ground, to a darkened goal box (13 x 22 cm, with a 5 x 6 cm doorway) situated 60 cm above the ground (Figure 4A). Mice naturally seek out the darkness and protection of the goal box in favor of the exposed beam and are further encouraged to traverse the beam by the slight incline which exploits their natural escape mechanism to run in an upwards direction14. The beam itself is 1 m in length and has a circular cross section with a diameter of 14 mm. A tailored range of beam diameters can be used which allows the experimenter to adjust the sensitivity of the test or accommodate larger subjects. At the lower end of the balance beam a white line indicates the starting line. Another line has been drawn 60 cm from the start line at the higher end of the beam to indicate the finish line (Figure 4A).\n\t\nPosition 2 cameras, one on either side of the balance beam, at the lower end of the balance beam (Figure 4B).\n\t\tNote: These cameras should be angled to capture the entire length of the balance beam and ensure that start and finish lines marked on the balance beam are clearly visible. These cameras will be used to video record the behavior of mice as they traverse the balance beam, with resulting videos being used for later analysis.\nLine the floor of the goal box with paper towel, to enable easy cleaning of urine and feces after testing each mouse, and place the housing dome from the subjects home cage inside the goal box.",
    "Place adequate foam or other cushioning material underneath the raised beam to protect any subjects that fall from the apparatus. Mice that fall will be picked up immediately by the experimenter and placed inside the goal box to rest.\nPlace one mouse in the goal box for 2 min so that it becomes familiar with this environment. Cover the opening to the goal box with a gloved hand for 5 sec if the mouse tries to walk onto the beam during this time to discourage this behavior.\nTrain the mouse by placing it on the beam just outside the opening to the goal box and allowing it to walk into the goal box. Continue to train the mouse by placing it on the beam progressively further away from the goal box until the mouse is able to walk from the start line to the goal box with no assistance and minimal hesitation. Leave the mouse to rest in the goal box for 1 min after each run.\nBegin testing the mouse when training is complete. \n\t\nStart video recording on cameras.\nPlace the mouse at the start line of the beam and wait while it traverses the beam in the direction of the goal box.\nStop video recording on cameras when the mouse reaches the box.\nLeave the mouse to rest in the goal box for 1 min. Remove any urine or feces that may have been deposited during the trial while waiting.\nRepeat steps 3.4.1 to 3.4.4 until a total of 5 trials have been completed.",
    "Switch on the custom built rotator at 3 Hz for 20 sec (like in the fixed speed rotarod test) to allow the mice to become familiar with the sound. Stop the rotator after 20 sec by switching off the drill and place hands on either side of the running wheel to stop it from spinning.\nPlace the mouse inside the chamber at the center of the rotator and replace the lid.\nSwitch on the rotator at its lowest setting of 3 Hz for 20 sec. Start video recording on the cameras during this time, in preparation for the upcoming trial. Switch off the drill at the end of the 20 sec and place hands on either side of the running wheel to stop it from continuing to spin past the initial 20 sec. Transfer the mouse to the start of the balance beam as quickly as possible and wait while the mouse traverses the beam to the goal box.\nStop video recording on cameras when the mouse reaches the goal box and return the mouse to its cage.\nClean the balance beam apparatus with 70% ethanol and change the paper towel in the goal box after each mouse has been tested.\nSubscription Required.
