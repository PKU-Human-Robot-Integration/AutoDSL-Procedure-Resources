    "Wear a lab coat, gloves, and safety glasses at all times while performing all procedures in this protocol. Ensure that containers/tubes containing the phenol and guanidine isothiocyanate reagent are only opened in a certified hood, and dispose of phenol waste in a designated container. Use DNAse/RNAse-free sterile tubes, tips, and reagents.\n1. Cell Culture\nGrow the HeLa cell line and two suspension mantle cell lymphoma cell lines, Granta-519 and Jeko-1, in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 100 U/mL Penicillin/Streptomycin in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Dilute the cells 1:10 and count using a particle counter14.\nFor RNA extraction, plate 500,000 cells/well in a 6 well plate (2 mL media per well). After incubation for 24 h, collect RNA from the cells.\n2. RNA Extraction\nHarvesting cells\n\tNOTE: With the exception of the centrifugation step, perform all the listed steps in a tissue culture hood to maintain sterility.\n\t\nFor suspension cells (Jeko-1 and Granta-519):\n\t\t\nTransfer the cells (together with 2 mL of media) to a 15 mL tube, and centrifuge at 1,725 x g for 5 min. Aspirate the media and leave the cell pellet in the bottom of the tube.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 50 µL of 1x Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). Add 500 µL of monophasic phenol and guanidine isothiocyanate reagent to each sample in the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Mix well and leave at room temperature (RT) for 5 min while inverting the microcentrifuge tube every 1 min.\nFor adherent cells (HeLa):\n\t\t\nAspirate the cell culture media from each well. Add 1 mL of PBS to each well to wash off debris.\nRemove the PBS and add 500 µL of monophasic phenol and guanidine isothiocyanate reagent to each well.",
    "Incubate at RT for 5 min with gentle rocking. Transfer to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nCell lysis\n\t\nFreeze the phenol and guanidine isothiocyanate cell mixture at -20 °C for 1 h.\n\t\tNOTE: The mix can be left at -20 °C overnight or until needed.\nThaw the phenol and guanidine isothiocyanate cell mixture on ice. Add 100 µL of chloroform to the microcentrifuge tube in a PCR hood. Vortex the sample for 10 - 15 s until the mixture is pink and opaque. Incubate the sample on ice (at 4 °C) for 15 min.\nCentrifuge the sample for 15 min at 20,800 x g and 4 °C. Carefully remove the upper colorless aqueous phase (~ 200 µL) and transfer to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nRNA precipitation\n\t\nAdd an equal volume of isopropanol to each sample. Add 1 µL of coprecipitant (see Table of Materials) to each sample to act as a carrier for the RNA and help visualize the RNA in subsequent steps. Incubate the sample at -80 °C for at least 4 h. For best results, incubate overnight at -80 °C.\nTransfer the sample to a cooled centrifuge. Centrifuge for 35 min at 20,800 x g / 4 °C; the RNA will appear as a blue speck on the bottom of the tube. Carefully remove the isopropanol from the sample. Add 500 µL of 80% ethanol and resuspend the pellet by briefly vortexing for 3 s.",
    "Centrifuge the sample at 20,800 x g at RT for 5 min. Remove all the ethanol from the sample. Let the sample air-dry for about 10 min. Resuspend the sample in 35 µL of RNAse-free water. Place on a heat block (65 °C) for 5 min to ensure that the RNA is fully in solution, and immediately place the tube on ice.\nDetermine the concentration of total RNA using a spectrophotometer as previously described, except use 1.5 µL of the RNA sample instead of 1 µL15. Optionally, run 1 µg of total RNA on a 1% agarose gel to determine the RNA integrity.\n3. DNase Treatment\nAfter quantification of the RNA, perform DNAse treatment on the total RNA to degrade any genomic DNA. For each sample, add the following reagents from the RNAse-free DNAse kit to make a 20 µL total reaction mix in a separate microcentrifuge tube:\n\t\nMix 2 µL of DNase 10X reaction buffer with 4.4 µg of total RNA. Bring to a total of 14 µL with water.\nAdd 2 µL of RNase-free DNAse. Incubate at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of 2 µL of RNase inhibitor (from the Reverse Transcription Kit).\nAdd 2 µL of Stop Solution and heat on a heat block for 10 min at 70 °C to inactivate the DNAse enzyme.\n\t\tNOTE: DNAse treatment is optional.\n4. cDNA Synthesis\nFor a final reaction volume of 50 µL:",
    "For a final reaction volume of 50 µL: Transfer 22 µL of the DNase treated RNA to a new tube, or transfer 4 µg of total RNA with added water to a total volume of 22 µL to a new tube. Add 2 µL of the T7 oligo dT25 primer from 10 µM primer solution. The sequence for the T7 oligo dT25 primer is 5'-GCCGGTAATACGACTCACTATAGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3'.\nFrom the Reverse Transcription kit add 2 µL of the RNase inhibitor (20 U/µL), 8 µL of the 5x Reaction buffer, 4 µL of 10 mM dNTPs, and 2 µL of the Reverse transcriptase (200 U/µL).\n\tNOTE: Set up a reaction without reverse transcriptase to act as a negative control.\nIncubate at 42 °C for 1 h. Transfer directly to ice. Heat the tube at 75 °C for 5 min and place the tube on ice.\n5. Primer Search for Fusion Gene Transcript\nPrimer design\nDownload the cDNA sequence from the Ensemble genome browser (ENST00000360839.6/NM_017747), and identify a region within the ORF of the target transcript (ANKHD1) upstream of the stop codon. Copy and paste the entire region (up to 700 nucleotides) containing sequences upstream of the stop codon into the sequence entry region of the primer design software (<https://www.idtdna.com/Primerquest/Home/Index>).\nSelect the show custom design option and select 10 for the number of primers that the system should generate (results to return) and leave all the other parameters set to default.\nChoose five forward primers and two reverse primers that do not overlap. Order primers and reconstitute with RNAse/DNAse-free water to a final concentration of 10 µM. More details about general primer design for PCR are covered elsewhere16.\nPCR to identify potential primers for use in subsequent 3' RACE",
    "NOTE: To determine the final forward primers to use in the reaction, test the designed primers by setting up different combinations of forward and reverse primers for regular PCR in a PCR hood.\n\t\nTransfer the cDNA (2 µL) to a fresh 0.5 mL PCR tube. Add 1 µL of the forward primer and 1 µL of the reverse primer (from a 10 mM primer solution). Make up to 12.5 µL by adding 8.5 µL of nuclease-free water. Add 12.5 µL of the 2x PCR-to-Gel Master Mix.\nUse the following PCR thermal cycling conditions: 95 °C for 2 min followed by 29 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. Set the final cycle at 68 °C for 7 min.\nAfter the PCR, run the products on a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Details of electrophoresis are as previously described with a few modifications17.\n\t\t\nDissolve 1 g of agarose in 100 mL of Tris-Acetate (TAE) buffer in a 250 mL flask. Boil in a microwave.\nLeave to cool for 1 min and add 7.5 µL of ethidium bromide solution (10 mg/mL stock) in a fume hood. Mix well by swirling the flask and pour into a horizontal gel apparatus. Leave at RT in the fume hood for at least 30 min to allow the gel to solidify.\nCover the gel with 1x TAE buffer and load 10 µL of the PCR product onto the agarose gel together with 3 - 5 µL of the DNA molecular weight ladder. Run at 175 V for 10 min. Visualize the products using an imager, and if further separation of products is needed, run the gel for an additional 5 - 10 min.\nSelection of nested primers for 3' RACE",
    "Analyze the results of the PCR agarose gel to select primers that have a distinct, strong, single PCR band. Use the 5'-most primer (ANKHD15'-CCTTCCCAGCGAGTTTCTAC-3') together with the T7 oligodT25 primer in the first PCR run.\nSelect the nested primer that is located downstream of the first primer (ANKHD1 5'-CGTTGGACACAGTGGAATCT-3'), and use it with the T7 primer (5'-GGCCTAATACGACTCACTATAG-3') in the second set of the PCR reactions.\n6. Optimizing 3' RACE to Map the 3' UTR Using Two Different Enzymes\nNOTE: There has been an increase in the diversity of DNA polymerases used for PCR; therefore, we wanted to determine standard conditions that can be applied even when using different enzymes for 3' RACE PCR reactions. The reverse primers for any transcript are kept constant; the only changes are in the nested forward primers that are specific for the target transcript.\nProtocol 1: 3' RACE using a modified DNA polymerase from Pyrococcus furiosus (Pfu)\nFirst PCR\n\t\t\nTransfer 1 µL of cDNA to a PCR tube and add 5 µL of 10x Pfu reaction buffer. Add 1 µL of the first nested forward primer, 1 µL of the T7 oligodT25 primer, and 1 µL of dNTPs (from a 10 mM solution).\nMake up to 49 µL total volume by adding 40 µL of water. Add 1 µL of Pfu DNA polymerase and mix well. Run the PCR using the PCR profile in Table 1.\nSecond PCR\n\t\t\nTransfer 2 µL of the products from the first PCR to a new PCR tube and mix with 5 µL of 10x PfuUltra II reaction buffer. Add 1 µL of the second nested PCR primer, 1 µL of the T7 primer, and 1 µL of dNTPs (10 mM solution).",
    "Make up to 49 µL total reaction volume by adding 39 µL of water. Add 1 µL of Pfu DNA polymerase. Run the PCR using the same PCR profile as the first PCR setup (Table 1).\nProtocol 2: 3' RACE using a chimeric DNA polymerase consisting of a DNA binding domain fused to a Pyrococcus-like proofreading polymerase PCR master mix\nFirst PCR\n\t\t\nTransfer 1 µL of cDNA to a PCR tube. Add 1 µL of the first nested forward primer and 1 µL of the T7 oligodT25 primer. Make up to 25 µL by adding 22 µL of water.\nAdd 25 µL of 2x PCR Master Mix and mix well. Use the PCR cycling conditions described in Table 2.\nSecond PCR\n\t\t\nTransfer 2 µL of the products from the first PCR to a new PCR tube. Add 1 µL of the second nested PCR primer together with 1 µL of the T7 reverse primer.\nMake up to 25 µL by adding 22 µL of water. Add 25 µL of 2X PCR Master Mix. Run the PCR using the same PCR profile as the first PCR setup (Table 2).\n7. Verify the second PCR product of 3' RACE.\nTake 5 - 10 µL of the second PCR product (as well as product from the first round of PCRs if the transcript is abundantly expressed) and run on an agarose gel. Set up the gel and run the electrophoresis as previously described (steps 5.2.3.1 to 5.2.3.3). Visualize results on an imager.\n8. Product Purification and Sequencing\nPurify the gel PCR products from the second PCR using the Gel and PCR Fragment DNA Clean-Up System as per the manufacturer's protocol.",
    "Perform Sanger sequencing (alternatively, send the gel purified PCR product samples and appropriate sequencing primers to a sequencing lab). Analyze the sequencing data after Sanger sequencing.\nDownload sequence-analyzing software (see Table of Materials) and import the trace files into the software. Use the individual PURE Base QVs (Quality Values) to obtain the Base call information18. Download the chromatogram with high quality traces for viewing.\n\tOptional: The gel purified product can be cloned using an appropriate cloning kit and the isolated clones sent for Sanger sequencing.\nSubscription Required.
