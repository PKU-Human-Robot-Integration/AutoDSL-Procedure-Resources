    "Parental Library ConstructionInoculate “donor” (in LB broth with Amp, 100 μg/ml) and “recipient” cells (in LB broth with Col, 20 μg/ml) at 37 °C with shaking and culture overnight.Prepare LB agar plate(s) without antibiotics. Let them dry well and place 0.45 μm membrane filters on top of the plates (four membranes can be applied to each plate) (see Note 3).Passage E. piscicida, 2 ml in 50 ml (4%), add CaCl2 to 50 mM (500 μl, 10 M), Rotate 200 rpm at 30 °C, the OD600 will reach ~0.6-0.8 after 1 h 15 min culture (see Note 4).Measure the OD600 of all bacteria, which are expected to be 0.8, for SM10 and E. piscicida, respectively.Move the culture into 50 ml corning tubes, spin 5,000 × g at 10 °C for 5 min, then wash with 10 ml LB and spin 5,000 × g for 10 min.Resuspend in LB with the following volume to reach final OD600 = 4.Mix equal volume of SM10 and E. piscicida in an Eppendorf tube, and spot 4*80 μl on the filter prepared in Step A2. Let drop adsorb into the agar and dry.Place these plates into a 30 °C incubator with care not to let the cell suspension spill outside the membrane (do not flip the plate).After 3 h of incubation, remove the filter into a 50-ml centrifuge tube by forceps. Resuspend cells from filters in 1 ml of LB broth by pipetting up/down and vortexing.Make serial dilutions of resuspended cells and plate 100 µl of 1:1, 1:10, and 1:100 dilutions onto LB agar plates containing Col and Gm (to provide an estimate of transposon insertion efficiency, as the actual library plates can become too crowded to pick colonies). Incubate overnight at 30 °C.",
