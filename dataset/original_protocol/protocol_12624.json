    "1. Preparation of lipid stock\nDissolve 1 g of 18:1 (Δ9-Cis) PC, 100 mg of 18:1 PEG2000 PE, and 5 mg of 18:1 biotinyl cap PE in 10 mL of chloroform.\n\tNOTE: Both DOPC and DPPE are well-characterized and (along with PEG modification) selected for their ability to minimize non-specific adsorption to the surface of the flow cell. Dissolved lipid master mix can be aliquoted and stored at -20 ˚C up to 12 months.\nUse chloroform to clean an organic-solvent glass syringe, then transfer 200 µL (10% of the final desired volume) of the lipid master mix to the glass vial.\nEvaporate the chloroform from the glass vial using a very gentle stream of compressed nitrogen. Slightly increase the pressure towards the end of the evaporation to ensure that all traces of chloroform are removed.\n\tNOTE: Tilt and rotate the vial during the evaporation process so that the lipids dry as a uniform layer of white film on the wall.\nPlace the vial uncapped under vacuum overnight.\nAdd 2 mL of lipid buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 100 mM NaCl) to the dried lipid film and cap the vial. Incubate at room temperature (RT) for at least 1 h and vortex until dissolved.\nTransfer the solution to a 5 mL polystyrene round-bottom tube and sonicate on ice using a microtip with the following parameters: amplitude = 50, process time = 1.5 min, pulse = 15 s, time off = 2 min. The solution will be clear after sonication (total energy = 1,500-2,000 J).\nFilter the solution through a 0.22 µm PVDF syringe filter and store the lipid stock at 4 ˚C for up to 1 month.\n2. Preparation of dsDNA substrate\nWarm the λ-DNA stock (500 μg/mL) to 65 ˚C.",
    "Prepare annealing/ligation mix containing: 1.6 pM of λ-DNA, 100x molar excess (160 pM) of each oligonucleotide (BioL: 5'Phos-AGG TCG CCG CCC-3Bio and DigR: 5'Phos-GGG CGG CGA CCT-3Dig_N) and 60 µL of 10x T4 ligase reaction buffer (in a total volume of 600 µL).\n\tNOTE: BioL and DigR oligonucleotides are biotinylated (Bio) and modified with digoxigenin (Dig), respectively. Biotinylation allows the attachment of DNA molecules to biotinylated lipids via streptavidin linkages. The Dig modification enables double tethering through binding of anti-Dig antibodies that are coated on pedestals to Dig moieties.\nAnneal the oligonucleotides to the λ-DNA cos-ends by incubating the reaction at 65 ˚C for 10 min, then allow it to slowly cool to RT.\nAdd 5 µL of T4 DNA ligase and incubate at RT overnight.\n\tNOTE: Annealing and ligation steps may also be carried out in a thermal cycler.\nPrecipitate the λ-DNA by adding 300 µL of PEG-8000 solution (30% w/v PEG-8000 and 10 mM MgCl2). Incubate at 4 ˚C for at least 1 h.\nCentrifuge at 14,000 x g for 5 min at RT. Carefully remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet. Optionally, wash the pellet 1x with 500 µL of chilled 70% ethanol.\nResuspend the pellet in 40 µL of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA [pH 8.0]).\n3. Nanofabrication of chromium patterns\nDrill two holes at the center of a 1\" x 3\" quartz microscope slide (~3 cm apart) using a diamond-coated 1.4 mm drill bit on a table-top drill press (see Figure 1 for geometry of the drilling position).\nClean the drilled slides by submerging them into 200 mL of Piranha solution (75% sulfuric acid [97%] and 25% hydrogen peroxide). Incubate for 30 min.",
    "CAUTION: Extreme care must be taken to avoid all contact with exposed skin. Prepare the solution by very slowly mixing cold hydrogen peroxide into sulfuric acid. Dispose of Piranha waste properly in a designated waste container.\nRinse slides by submerging in 200 mL of double-distilled water. Repeat 2x to eliminate any remaining Piranha. Dry the slides with a gentle stream of compressed nitrogen.\nUsing a spin coater (4,000 rpm for 45 s, ramp rate of 300 rpm/s), coat the clean slides with photoresist and conductive polymer as follows:\n\t\nCoat slides with a layer of 3% (w/v) polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA; 24.3K MW; dissolved in anisole).\nCoat slides with a layer of 1.5% (w/v) polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA; 495K MW; dissolved in anisole).\nCoat slides with a layer of antistatic agent for electron beam lithography.\nWrite custom patterns for barriers and pedestals on the coated slides using electron beam lithography with a scanning electron microscope equipped with nanopattern generation system software.\nDevelop the slides by first rinsing off the antistatic agent for the electron beam lithography with double-distilled water. Then, place them into 50 mL tubes containing the developing solution (75% methyl isobutyl ketone [MIBK] and 25% isopropanol; keep chilled at -20 ˚C) and sonicate in an ice bath on low power for 1 min.\nRinse off the developing solution with isopropanol and dry with a gentle stream of compressed nitrogen.\nUsing an electron beam evaporator, deposit a 250 Å thick layer of chrome onto the patterned surface at 0.5 Å/s.\nLift off the chrome and remaining PMMA using acetone from a squirt bottle, followed by sonicating the slides in an acetone bath for 10 min. Wash again with acetone from a squirt bottle.",
    "To prevent any deposits from the remaining acetone, rinse the slides with isopropyl alcohol and dry with a gentle stream of compressed nitrogen.\n4. Assembly of flow cell\nPlace a 35 mm x 5 mm rectangular paper template (covering the chrome pattern as well as the predrilled inlet/outlet holes) over the quartz slide, with the patterned side facing up ( Figure 1A).\nApply a piece of double-sided tape (1 mm thickness) over the quartz slide, covering the paper template, then use a razor blade to cut out the rectangular paper template ( Figure 1A).\nPlace a glass coverslip over the double-sided tape and apply gentle pressure to seal the coverslip to the tape ( Figure 1A). The space between the coverslip and slide, sealed by double-sided tape, forms the microfluidic chamber.\n\tNOTE: It is crucial that the seal between the cover slip and slide is sufficiently secure to prevent leakage during the experiment.\nPlace the coverslip-slide sandwich in between glass slides and attach binder clips on all four sides to distribute pressure evenly. Place the assembly in a vacuum oven for 60 min at 135 ˚C to melt the double-sided tape and seal the chamber.\nRemove it from the oven, then release the binder clips and glass slides.\nAttach microfluidic ports to the predrilled inlet/outlet holes with a hot glue gun by placing the glued assembly onto a heating block (220 ˚C) for 1 min, taking it off, and carefully applying gentle pressure to properly seal the microfluidic ports. Allow glue to cure completely before proceeding.\n\tNOTE: Assembled flow cells may be placed in 50 mL tubes and stored under vacuum.\n5. Assembly of dsDNA curtain\nAttach inlet/outlet tubing to the flow cell microfluidic ports and wash the chamber with 20 mL of double-distilled water using two 10 mL syringes.",
    "With 10 mL syringe filled with double-distilled water connected to both sides of the flow cell, apply force to push/pull the water between the inlet and outlet syringes. This step removes all air bubbles from the flow cell.\nWash the chamber with 3 mL of lipid buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 100 mM NaCl).\n\tNOTE: Make sure all connections to flow cells are drop-to-drop to avoid introducing air bubbles into the flow cell.\nMix 40 µL of liposome solution with 1 mL of lipid buffer. Inject 300 µL of the lipid solution into the flow cell and incubate for 5 min. Repeat the injection and incubation 2x.\n\tNOTE: Alternate the inlet/outlet side for injection each time a syringe is connected to the flow cell.\nWash the chamber with 3 mL of lipid buffer and incubate for 15 min.\n\tNOTE: This incubation period can vary from 5 min to 2 h, depending on the scheduling of experiments, without noticeable differences in final curtain assembly.\nMix 40 µL of 1 mg/mL anti-digoxigenin stock solution with 200 µL of lipid buffer. Inject 100 µL of the solution and incubate for 10 min. Repeat the injection and incubation 1x before washing with 3 mL of lipid buffer.\n\tNOTE: This step is needed only for double-tethered dsDNA curtains. Skip this step for single-tethered dsDNA curtains.\nWash the chamber with 3 mL of BSA buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, and 0.2 mg/mL BSA).\nMix 10 µL of 1 mg/mL streptavidin stock solution with 990 µL of BSA buffer. Inject as two separate 400 µL injections with a 10 min incubation after each injection.\nWash the chamber with 3 mL of BSA buffer to remove any excess streptavidin.",
    "Dilute 25 ng of dsDNA substrate stock in 1 mL BSA buffer. Slowly inject the DNA solution 200 µL at a time, followed by a 5 min incubation after each injection. The amount of DNA needed may be optimized for specific types of experiments.\nMount the flow cell onto the microscope stage and adjust the focus as necessary.\nConnect the input and output ports to a sample injection system comprised of a syringe pump and high-pressure switch valve.\nDouble-tether the DNA to the pedestals (12 µm tether length) by continuously washing the chamber with BSA buffer at 0.8 mL/min for 5 min.\n\tNOTE: It may be necessary to adjust flow rates and times to optimize for different double-tether lengths. This step is needed only for double-tethered DNA curtains. Skip this step for single-tethered dsDNA curtains.\nThe curtains are now ready for experiments.\n6. Recycling of flow cells\nSubmerge the slides in ethanol for at least 30 min before using a razor blade to carefully remove the microfluidic ports and coverslip. Properly dispose of the coverslip and clean any remaining glue off the microfluidic ports so they can be reused. Scrub clean any glue residue on the slide.\n\tNOTE: Take care not to scratch the patterned area in the center of the slide.\nThoroughly rinse the slides with double-distilled water and submerge in 2% alkaline liquid quartz cleaning concentrate overnight, with stirring.\nThoroughly rinse the slides with double-distilled water and submerge in 2% alkaline liquid quartz cleaning concentrate solution for 1 h with stirring at 80 ˚C, followed by sonicating for 15 min at 45 ˚C.\nThoroughly rinse the slides with double-distilled water and submerge in 1 M NaOH for 30-60 min, with stirring.",
    "Thoroughly rinse the slides with double-distilled water, then submerge in isopropyl alcohol and sonicate for 15 min at 45 ˚C.\nThoroughly rinse the slides with ethanol and submerge in ethanol for 1 h, with stirring.\nPlace the slides in a vacuum oven for 1 h to dry at 135 ˚C. The slides are now ready to be reassembled into flow cells."
