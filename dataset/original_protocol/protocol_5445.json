    "Linear forked DNA template constructionWe primarily use two types of linear forked DNA substrates to assay leading/lagging strand replication: a linear pUC based natural sequence substrate (referred to below as 3kbf, for 3 kb fork), and a 3.2 kb nucleotide-biased, leading/lagging strand substrate that is generated synthetically such that one strand has no dC and the other strand has no dG (referred to as 3nbf, for 3 kb nucleotide biased fork). The 3nbf substrate can be used in leading and lagging strand assays to monitor each strand independent of the other (see Figure 1). We sometimes prefer to use a 5’-32P-labeled primer to quantify leading strand replication as it is a direct reporter of primer elongation compared to use of 32P-dNTPs because it lacks potential end-labeling artifacts. Though both substrates can accommodate a primer, we typically only use the 3kbf substrate for this purpose because it is much simpler to prepare (i.e., does not require purification of the 3 kb synthetic nucleotide biased section from a low melt gel). Although the template length and composition differs between these substrates, we use the same small synthetic fork construct that is ligated onto either of these substrates. The fork is composed of a 160 mer for the leading strand and a 91 mer for the lagging strand. The leading strand contains a 3’ (dT)34 tail for CMG loading, a 37 nucleotide primer annealing site followed by a 4 nucleotide region lacking dC and dA residues and a 10 nucleotide region lacking dC and dT residues (see Recipes for oligonucleotide composition). The 4 nucleotide region upstream of the primer allows ‘idling’ of Pol ε on the leading strand by only including dATP and dCTP (i.e., to prevent the 3’-5’ exonuclease activity of Pol ε from degrading the primer).",
    "The 10 nucleotide region prevents ‘runaway’ Pol ε after potential misincorporation (i.e., even with dTTP withheld). Following these sequences, we include a (dT)40 spacer to the fork junction designed to accommodate the footprint of CMG (~10 nm). The lagging strand contains a (dT)60 5’-tail and 35 bp complementary to the 5’ end of the leading strand. The leading strand fork template oligo typically contains four 3’ phosphorothioate bonds to protect against exonuclease activity inherent in DNA polymerases by substituting a sulfur atom for a non-bridging phosphate oxygen atom in the oligonucleotide backbone (available as a modification from DNA synthesis companies, such as IDT). See Figure 1 for a schematic of the nucleotide biased substrate.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170911/20170911032257_9345.jpgFigure 1. Schematic of nucleotide biased substrate. The “3nbf” substrate, including the oligonucleotides described in the text, is shown with the relevant features highlighted. The bias is designed such that 32P-α-dCTP will only be incorporated during leading strand synthesis, while 32P-α-dGTP will only be incorporated during lagging strand synthesis. Dotted lines indicate restriction enzyme cut sites discussed in the text. Note that the “3kbf” substrate, which is constructed using the same synthetic fork but using a 2,686 bp template with natural (unbiased) sequence, is not shown. 3kbf substrate construction (typically used for leading strand reactions using a 32P-primer) Resuspend ‘160Ld’ to 20 μM in TE buffer (see Recipes)Resuspend ‘91Lg’ to 500 μM in TE buffer.Digest 35 pmol pUC19 with 4 μl BsaI-HF (20 U/μl) in 1x CutSmart buffer in 40 μl total at 37 °C for 4 h.Heat inactivate BsaI-HF at 75 °C for 30 sec.Add 17.5 μl (350 pmol) 160Ld and 4.2 μl (2,100 pmol) 91Lg in TE, and add 238.3 μl TE to 400 μl.",
    "Note: The 10:1 excess of fork to template is required to prevent concatamerization of linearized pUC19, and the 6:1 excess of 91Lg to 160Ld is to ensure all ligated 160Ld is annealed to 91Lg.Anneal fork to template by heating to 95 °C for 5 sec and let heat block cool to RT on benchtop.Ligate fork onto linear pUC19 by adding 15 μl T4 ligase, 36 μl 10x CutSmart buffer, 4 μl 100 mM ATP (1 mM final), adding TE to 400 μl volume. Incubate at 16 °C for ≥ 16 h.Add 10 μl 0.5 M EDTA to chelate Mg2+.Heat inactivate T4 ligase at 65 °C for 20 sec.Add 10 μl 5 M NaCl to bring [NaCl] to > 100 mM (necessary to prevent nonspecific binding to Sepharose 4B column).Pour a ~20 ml Sepharose 4B column and equilibrate with > 2 column volumes (CV) of cold DNA elution buffer (see Recipes). Adapt syringe tip to end of the column. Adapt polyethylene tubing to syringe tip and couple to fraction collector with the minimum length required for the device to reach all tubes.Add 420 μl reaction to 20 ml Sepharose 4B column, ensuring that buffer has completely seeped into the column bed before loading the reaction volume. After the sample has completely penetrated the column bed, add and elute with cold DNA elution buffer.Collect ~227 μl fractions (10 drops/fxn for the tubing we use). Under these conditions, the template should elute around fraction 20.Run 7 μl of each fraction on a 1% TBE agarose gel alongside a 1 kb MW marker (with gel loading buffer) at 100 V until the bromophenol blue marker reaches 2/3 the way down. Stain with 2-5 μl EthBr in 1x TBE and visualize on a gel imager.",
    "Notes:  The gel shift of the linearized plasmid from ligated fork DNA is very small, so do not expect to see a difference. However the ligated fork DNA will elute much earlier than the excess of free synthetic forked DNA, which can be visualized on a properly stained/destained gel. We have quantified fork ligation with radiolabeled fork, and it is highly (> 95%) efficient, thus the 3 kb template is attached to the DNA fork under the conditions described above.Nonetheless, we encourage users to actually monitor their ligation efficiency using 32P-labelled fork DNA to be sure of ligation, and use of phi29 DNA polymerase in the extension of a 32P-labeled primer (i.e., see below) to further ensure ligation efficiency.Save fractions containing the ~2.7 kb band (this will be the sole visible band amongst all the fractions) and measure DNA concentration via A260 using a UV/Vis spectrophotometer. Follow manufacturer’s protocols to 5’-end-label the primer with T4 kinase and 32P-γ-ATP. We typically use a 25 μl reaction with a final primer concentration of 400 nM. Purify away free 32P-γ-ATP with a G-25 column that has been equilibrated with TE, according to the manufacturer’s protocol.To prime the 3kbf substrate with 32P-primer, add the required amount of 3kbf substrate with an equimolar amount of 32P-primer. Minimize the total volume, add 20x SSC (see Recipes) to a final 1x concentration, heat to 95 °C and cool to RT on the benchtop.3nbf substrate construction Resuspend ‘160Ld’ to 20 μM in TE buffer.Resuspend ‘91Lg’ to 500 μM in TE buffer.Digest ~400 μg plasmid containing 3.2 kb nucleotide-biased template (see Supplementary file 1[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20170911/Supplemental file 1.docx] for sequence) with 12 μl (20 U/μl) BsaI-HF in 1x CutSmart buffer in 400 μl total at 37 °C for 7 h.Before the previous step is finished, run 0.",
    "5 μl on a 0.8% TBE agarose gel at 100 V until the bromophenol blue reaches 2/3 the way down to ensure complete cutting. If cutting is not complete, add more BsaI-HF and digest more; repeat until cutting is complete.Add 12 μl BtsCI (20 U/μl) plus enough 10x CutSmart buffer and to compensate for added volume. Incubate at 50 °C for 6 h.Before digest is finished, run 0.5 μl on gel as in step 4 (Procedure A, 3nbf substrate construction) to ensure complete digest.Add 21.5 μl 0.5 M EDTA.Place sample in vacuum desiccator for 6-8 h to reduce volume by roughly 1/3.Run entire sample on 1.2% TBE low-melt agarose gel (well is 8 of 15 teeth of comb taped together). Add 2 μl 10 mg/ml EthBr to 100 ml gel. Pre-chill TBE, adding 2 μl 10 mg/ml EthBr for every 100 ml running buffer used. Run at 40-50 V with the apparatus sitting in a Styrofoam box full of ice-water (a cold room is not sufficient) until the bromophenol blue reaches the bottom third of the gel. Donning UV-protective face shield, visualize on a UV light box and cut out the largest (3,260 bp) band out with a razor blade. Weigh the gel slice for the next steps.Melt gel slices at 65 °C.Weigh melted slices and add 1/9 V Tris-HCl, pH 6.8 and 1/224 V 0.5 M EDTA, under the rough approximation that the density of the gel is 1 g/ml.Cool to 42 °C.Add ~5 μl β-agarase I per gram of gel. Incubate at 42 °C for 5-7 h. Repeat step 13 (Procedure A, 3nbf substrate construction).Isopropanol precipitate the DNA fragment.Add 1/10 the volume of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2, followed by an equal volume of isopropanol. Incubate for 1 h at -20 °C.",
    "Spin in a microcentrifuge at ≥ 15,000 x g for 30 min. Note: If too much agar has not been digested sufficiently to small oligosaccharides, you will see a lot of white precipitate. You will need to finish the precipitation, re-suspend in aqueous solution, and go back to step 13 (Procedure A, 3nbf substrate construction) to perform a further β-agarase I digestion.Decant supernatant and resuspend pellet in TE pH 8.0.Remove EthBr by extraction with an equal volume of 1-butanol saturated water (see Recipes). Gently vortex to mix. Spin at 1,500 x g, saving the bottom solution. Continue extracting until there is no visible pink color. Extract 3 more times.Ethanol precipitateAdd 1 μl glycogen (20 mg/ml), 1/10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate pH 5.2, followed by an equal volume of cold ethanol. Incubate for 1 h at -20 °C. Spin in a microcentrifuge at ≥ 15,000 x g for 30 min.Resuspend DNA in 150 μl TE pH 8.0.Run 2 μl, 4 μl, and 8 μl of 1:10 and 1:100 dilutions on 0.8% TBE agarose gel to estimate concentration.Use 35 pmol of this material for the subsequent steps.Add 350 pmol 160Ld and 2,100 pmol 91Lg in TE, and add TE to 300 μl. Note: The 10:1 excess of fork to template is required to prevent concatamerization, and the 6:1 excess of 91Lg to 160Ld is to ensure all ligated 160Ld is annealed to 91Lg.Anneal fork to template by heating to 95 °C for 5 sec and let heat block cool to RT on benchtop.Ligate fork onto linear pUC19 by adding 15 μl T4 ligase, 36 μl 10x CutSmart buffer, 4 μl 100 mM ATP (1 mM final), adding TE to 400 μl volume. Incubate at 16 °C for at least 16 h.Add 10 μl 0.5 M EDTA to chelate Mg2+.",
    "Heat inactivate T4 ligase at 65 °C for 20 sec.Add 10 μl 5 M NaCl to bring [NaCl] to >100 mM (necessary to prevent nonspecific binding to Sepharose 4B column).Adapt syringe tip to end of column. Adapt polyethylene tubing to syringe tip and couple to fraction collector with the minimum length required for the device to reach all tubes.Pour a ~20 ml Sepharose 4B column and equilibrate with > 2 column volumes (CV) of cold DNA elution buffer.Add 420 μl reaction to 20 ml Sepharose 4B column, ensuring that buffer has completely seeped into the column bed before adding.After the sample has completely seeped into the column bed, elute with cold DNA elution buffer.Collect ~227 μl fractions (10 drops/fraction).Run 7 μl of each fraction on a 1% TBE agarose gel alongside a 1 kb MW marker (with gel loading buffer) at 100 V until the bromophenol blue marker reaches about 2/3 the way down.Stain with 2-5 μl ethidium bromide in 1x TBE and visualize on a gel imager. Note: The gel shift of the linearized plasmid from fork tethering is very small, so do not expect to see a difference. It is also difficult to visualize free fork on this gel. We have quantified fork ligation with radiolabeled fork, and it is extremely (> 95%) efficient, thus the template should have fork attached.Save fractions containing the ~3.2 kb band (this should be the only visible band) and measure concentration via A260 on the spectrophotometer.Blunt the non-fork end of the forked template with blocking oligos. Resuspend ‘blockLd’ and ‘blockLg’ to 10 μM in TE pH 8.0. Add each oligo at a 2:1 oligo: template molar ratio. Heat to 85 °C for 5 sec, cool to RT on benchtop.",
    "Note: This step is required to prevent end-labeling of the BtsCI cut site during 32P-α-dNTP incorporation (i.e., Pol could use the non-ligated 5’ overhang as a template), however, it may be more practical to order the nucleotide-biased sequence that is removed by a blunt-cut site at this region instead.Ligate block oligos by adding 10 μl T4 ligase. Add 1/10 volume 10x T4 ligase buffer and supplement with 1 mM ATP. Incubate at 16 °C for at least 16 h.Heat inactivate T4 ligase at 65 °C for 20 sec.Primed phiX174 (model lagging strand) constructionIn addition to CMG-directed leading/lagging strand synthesis, we also find it useful to use a primed, RPA-coated circular 5.4 kb ssDNA (phiX174 virion circular ssDNA) as a model lagging strand in order to isolate potential lagging strand activity in the absence of the full replisome context.Resuspend Pr1B to 5 μM in TE pH 8.0 (see Recipes).Add 12 pmol Pr1B to 10 pmol phiX174 DNA (a 1.2:1 primer: template molar excess). Add buffer TE pH 8.0 to 57 μl, and 3 μl 20x SSC. Heat to 95 °C for 5 sec, cool to RT on benchtop.Replication assaysWe assume the reader has purified the full repertoire of proteins required to reconstitute the eukaryotic replisome, including at a minimum CMG helicase, Pols ε, δ and α, RFC, PCNA and RPA. Other accessory proteins such as Mcm10 and the Mrc1-Tof1-Csm3 complex will stimulate replication but are not an absolute requirement for activity. The purification and storage conditions of these proteins is beyond the scope of this protocol and can vary by specific experimental requirements, however, full purification details of the proteins are described in (Georgescu et al., 2014 and 2015) and (Langston et al., 2014). Make note of the concentrations and salt concentration of all protein stocks.",
    "Aliquot desired fractions into small (~10-25 μl) aliquots, flash freeze in liquid nitrogen, and store at -80 °C. We prefer to use 25 μl as a standard experimental volume to minimize protein consumption while keeping the working volumes manageable. Volumes as low as 15 μl or as high as 40 μl will also work fine. For the protocols listed here, we often separate into three phases: 1) Helicase loading on the substrate. 2) Polymerase-clamp loading, i.e., polymerase, RFC clamp loader, PCNA clamp, and 2 or 3 dNTPs that allow ‘idling’ (repeated cycles of nucleotide incorporation and proofreading) of the polymerase on the template to prevent primer degradation, and 3) Replication initiation by adding the full complement of 4 dNTPs. The first two stages may be combined if necessary, but ideally CMG loads onto forked DNA (or RPA coats ssDNA in the case of the lagging strand model) during incubation for 5-10 min or longer. On the other hand, the second stage contains exonuclease proficient polymerases, which will degrade the substrate and/or its primer, so at least two dNTPs and a moderate incubation time with these enzymes is necessary.The third stage initiates ongoing replication, by adding all remaining dNTPs, and in the case of fork assays, also RPA. In the examples given here, the first substrate loading phase is prepared and split into tubes as necessary, the second enzymatic phase is subsequently added, and the third initiation phase is added as the reaction timer starts. This staging method helps minimize errors derived from pipetting of small volumes, and then the splitting the mixed phases into relatively large volumes. Because enzymes are added with respect to the final volume, it may also facilitate use of low volume such that CMG loading onto DNA can be performed at relatively high concentration.",
    "Since each phase is prepared separately before mixing, it is important to independently add salts and buffers (i.e., TDBG, MK, and any additional salts required) to each phase before adding proteins in order to prevent precipitation, aggregation, etc. that may occur if adding proteins directly to low ionic strength, depending on the protein behavior/solubility requirements. Assuming there are differences in protein concentrations between experimental groups (e.g., during a protein titration), it is important to correct for incoming salt by adding the appropriate amount of salt to the tubes with lower protein concentrations–replication reactions are sensitive to salt conditions. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that salt has been correctly balanced.Salt calibrationMake a standard curve of conductivity vs. salt concentration for each type of salt used in the experiment and/or protein storage, and correct experiments.Prepare a serial dilution of salt, e.g., 0.1 M to 1 M.Add 10 μl each concentration to 990 μl of ddH2O.Measure conductivity, in mS/cm using a conductivity meter and plot against salt concentration.Compare conductivity of protein and/or experimental sample to standard curve. Adjust reactions with the appropriate salt as necessary.Leading and/or lagging strand replication; example 3-point timecourse leading/lagging (3nbf) experiment.Note: The following protocol is identical for the 3kbf (forked linear template), apart from the addition of radionucleotides in the 3nbf experiment, as noted. Do not initiate replication until each phase and time point stop tube has been prepared.  Substrate loading (see Table 1A).Table 1A. Substrate loading phase of leading/lagging strand replicationimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170911/20170911034426_5616.jpgLoad 0.5-2.0 nM 3nbf substrate with 10-30 nM CMG helicase (phase 1; 11 μl each). Example: In the following order, add 32.0 μl ddH2O, 13.2 μl 5x TDBG (see Recipes) (1x final), 6.6 μl 10x MK (see Recipes) (1x final), 11.3 μl 3kbf/3nbf (1.5 nM final), and 3.",
    "0 μl 1 μM CMG (20 nM final) for a final volume of 2 groups of 3 x 11 μl = 66 μl. Incubate at 30 °C for 10 min in the water bath. Split into two groups of 33 μl.Note: When splitting phases into separate groups, it may help to add one reaction volume to account for volume loss, e.g., split a volume that is sufficient for 7 reactions into 2 groups of 3. Enzyme loading (see Table 1B).Table 1B. Enzyme loading phase of leading/lagging strand replicationimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170911/20170911034855_1064.jpgAdd RFC/PCNA/Pol ε/α/δ.Example: In the following order, add 40.0 μl ddH2O, 14.0 μl 5x TDBG (1x final), 7.0 μl 10x MK (1x final), 2.5 μl dA/dC mix (see Recipes) (60 μM final), 1.3 μl 1 μM RFC (5 nM final), 1.3 μl 5 μM PCNA (25 nM final), 1.3 μl 2 μM Pol α (10 nM final), 1.3 μl 2 μM Pol ε (10 nM final), and 1.3 μl 2 μM Pol δ (10 nM final) for a final volume of 10 x 7 μl reactions = 70 μl. Add 21 μl (3 x 7 μl) to each reaction tube, mixing thoroughly with pipette. Incubate at 30 °C for 1 min.Note: The addition of dATP and dCTP enables polymerase idling on the primed substrate while allowing RFC to load PCNA with dATP.Replication initiation (see Table 1C).Table 1C. Replication initiation phase of leading/lagging strand replicationimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170911/20170911035323_5299.jpgInitiate replication by adding remaining dNTPs and RPA. Monitor with 32P-α-dCTP (leading strand) or 32P-α-dGTP (lagging strand) incorporation. Example: To each of two tubes, in the following order, add 14.0 μl ddH2O, 5.6 μl 5x TDBG (1x final), 2.8 μl 10x MK (1x final), 0.",
    "6 μl dT/dG mix (see Recipes) (60 μM final), 5 μl ATP (5 mM final), 2 μl of T/G/C mix (see Recipes) (200 μM final), and 3 μl 20 μM RPA (600 nM final). Spike the first tube (leading strand mix) with 1.0 μl 32P-α-dCTP (10 μCi/reaction). Add 1.0 μl 32P-α-dCTP to the second tube (lagging strand mix). Final volume of both initiation solutions is 28 μl, sufficient to collect time points for 4 reactions. Set a timer for 15 min. Add 21 μl of leading strand mix to the first tube; start the timer while mixing thoroughly with pipette. Add 21 μl of the lagging strand mix to the second tube. Remove 20 μl of reaction from each tube at 5, 10, and 15 min and quickly transfer to each of six tubes pre-filled with 10 μl of stop solution (see Recipes).Model of lagging strand replication using a primed ssDNA substrateThis is a similar protocol to the above, except CMG is not included and the substrate is a primed ssDNA circle, typically phage phiX174 or M13 (or an M13 derivative). Thus, no unwinding is required (i.e., CMG is on the leading strand, not the lagging strand). The clamp, clamp loader and DNA polymerases are all stimulated by pre-coating the ssDNA with single strand binding protein, allowing one to coat the substrate with RPA beforehand, which otherwise prevents CMG loading. The primer is chosen such that a run of dC and dT is just downstream on the template, making dATP and dGTP the included nucleotides for polymerase idling.Substrate loading (see Table 2A).Table 2A. Substrate loading phase of lagging strand modelimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170911/20170911183004_6372.jpgLoad 0.5-2.0 nM lagging strand model substrate (phiX174:Pr1B) with 600 nM RPA (phase 1; 11 μl each). Example: In the following order, add 16.7 μl ddH2O, 6.",
    "6 μl 5x TDBG (1x final), 3.3 μl 10x MK (1x final), 0.75 μl phiX174:Pr1b (1.5 nM final), 1.5 μl 3 mM dATP (60 μM final), 1.5 μl 3 mM dGTP (60 μM final), 0.4 μl 100 mM ATP (0.5 mM final), and 2.3 μl 20 μM RPA (600 nM final) for a final volume of 3 x 11 μl = 33 μl. Incubate at 30 °C for 10 min in the water bath. Enzyme loading (see Table 2B).Table 2B. Enzyme loading phase of lagging strand modeimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170911/20170911183136_6546.jpgLoad RFC/PCNA/α/δ. Example: In the following order, add 23.3 μl ddH2O, 7.0 μl 5x TDBG (1x final), 3.5 μl 10x MK (1x final), 0.6 μl 1 μM RFC (5 nM final), 0.6 μl 5 μM PCNA (25 nM final), 0.6 μl 2 μM Pol α (10 nM final), and 0.6 μl 2 μM Pol δ (10 nM final) for a final volume of 5 x 7 μl reactions = 35 μl. Add 21 μl (3 x 7 μl) to each reaction tube, mixing thoroughly with a pipette tip. Incubate at 30 °C for 1 min. Replication initiation (see Table 2C).Table 2C. Replication initiation phase of lagging strand modelimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170911/20170911183252_2630.jpgInitiate replication by adding the nucleotides that had been withheld during preincubation. Example: in the following order, add 10.5 μl ddH2O, 4.2 μl 5x TDBG (1x final), 2.1 μl 10x MK (1x final), 0.5 μl 3 mM dCTP (20 μM final), 1.5 μl 3 mM dTTP (60 μM final), 1.5 μl T/C/G mix (200 μM final), 2 μl of T/G/C mix (200 μM final). Spike with 0.75 μl 32P-α-dCTP (10 μCi/reaction). Set a timer for 3 min. Add 21 μl of initiation mix; start timer while mixing thoroughly with pipette.",
    "Remove 20 μl of reaction at 1, 2, and 3 min and quickly transfer to each of three tubes pre-filled with 10 μl of stop solution.Replication product visualizationFor 3nbf experiments, leading strand products should look similar to those in Figure 1b of Georgescu et al. (2015); i.e., products whose length increases over time and goes to full length (3.2 kb) by ~10 min or less. Using an end-labeled primer to monitor primer extension on the 3kbf substrate, results should look similar to those in Figure 3b of Schauer et al. (2017); i.e., products whose length increases over time and goes to full length (2.8 kb). Replisome-directed lagging strand replication should appear similar to those in Figure 6 of Schauer et al. (2017); i.e., ~200 bp products. For all CMG-directed experiments, subtraction of either CMG or ATP from the experiment is a good negative control and should yield no extended product. Using the lagging strand model substrate, the experiments should look similar to those in Figure 1b in Schauer et al. (2017); i.e., robust full length (5.4 kb) product in under 3 min.Prepare ladderFollow manufacturer’s protocols to 5’-end-label the 1 kb DNA ladder with T4 kinase and 32P-γ-ATP. Typically, we label 20 μl of the ladder in 50 μl total with 5 μl T4 PNK and 4 μl 32P-γ-ATP. Purify away free 32P-γ-ATP with a G-25 column that has been equilibrated with TE, according to the manufacturer’s protocol.Prepare alkaline agarose gelAdd 2.6 or 1.6 g LE agarose to 200 ml distilled H2O (1.3% for 3nbf/3kbf substrates, 0.8% for lagging strand model substrates). Microwave until boiling. Cool to at least 60 °C and add 0.5 ml 0.5 M EDTA and 0.6 ml 10 N NaOH before pouring the gel. Let cool to room temperature (RT) over ~2 h.",
    "Submerge in alkaline running buffer (see Recipes) in horizontal gel box.Load samples and DNA standard in gel. Run for 16 h at 35 V. Remove free radionucleotidesRemove gel from gel box and expose to phosphorimaging screen for 15 min. Scan on phosphorimager and print gel at full size. Cut the saturated portion off of the printout, overlay it on the gel, and cut the bottom part of the gel off that contains free radionucleotides (usually the bottom third or fourth) in order to reduce exposure of yourself and your lab equipment. The identification of this region is particularly important when monitoring lagging strand synthesis as free radionucleotides do not run too far below Okazaki fragments. Free radionucleotides can also be run off the gel, but it contaminates the equipment, creates further radioactive waste, and they tend to diffuse in the buffer and can leach back into the entire gel and contribute to background signal.Compress the gelWrap plastic wrap tightly around a flat surface like the bottom of a plexiglass radiation shield. Place the gel slab on the saran wrap. Place C-fold paper towels flat; one adjacent to each gel edge. Place one sheet of DEAE-cellulose paper over gel. Place one or two sheets of Whatman 3MM chromatography transfer paper over this. Stack 2 horizontal rows of ~25 C-fold paper towels over this. Cover paper towels with something flat and rigid (e.g., a flat plexiglass shield) to distribute weight. Gently rest a heavy weight (e.g., a lead brick) on the center of this assembly and press thin (few mm thick) for 6-12 h. We find this procedure superior to using a gel dryer, and it doubles as a step to allow DNA to transfer and immobilize on the DEAE-cellulose paper.",
    "Remove all paper except DEAE-cellulose, wrap in plastic wrap, and expose gel face to phosphorimaging screen for 2-36 h, depending on isotope strength. Scan phosphorimaging screen on a phosphorimager."
