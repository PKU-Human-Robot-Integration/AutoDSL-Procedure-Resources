    "All procedures were conducted with prior approval of the institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Texas at Dallas. ICR (CD-1) (30-35 g) and C57/BL6 (25-30 g) mice aged 6-8 weeks were used in this study.\n1. Dural infuser\nCreate the mouse infusers/injectors by modifying a commercially available internal cannula and infuser for unilateral injections with a non-metallic fused silica plastic cap that is adjustable and inserts into/extends below a 28 G guide cannula with inner diameter (I.D.) of 0.18 mm and an outer diameter (O.D.) of 0.35 mm (Figure 1A).\nUse a caliper or other measuring device to adjust the fused silica plastic cap on the infuser to a length of 0.6 mm; measured from the tip of the infuser to the edge of the silica plastic cap.\n\t\nTake caution not to bend or dull the infuser when adjusting the plastic cap.\nFor other mouse strains that have not been previously used for dural injections, determine the optimal infuser length by setting the length to 0.6 mm and conducting pilot injections with ink or dye, adjusting the infuser length until it is observed that the dye is only in the dura mater and not on the brain or skull.\nAttach the long end (or the end that was not measured to be 0.6 mm) of the adjusted infuser to plastic tubing (pump tubing, 2-stop, I.D. 0.19 mm, length 406 mm).\n\t\nCut the tubing to a minimum length of 8 in to ensure there is sufficient line to hold a volume of 5 µL.\nMake sure the tubing covers the metal part and the top of the plastic stopper located on the infuser. This will help prevent air bubbles from accumulating in the line.",
    "Attach the other end of the tubing to a 10 µL glass microsyringe (gas-tight; cemented needle; 21 G with a 10 mm projection), again, making sure to have a tight seal over the metal part of the syringe (Figure 1A).\nOnce the line is connected, backfill the syringe with 5 µL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), synthetic interstitial fluid (SIF), or other vehicles of choice to prevent air bubbles from forming.\n\t\nIf air bubbles are observed in the line, flood the line with the vehicle until the bubbles have dissipated.\n\t\tNOTE: It may help to fill the syringe with the vehicle prior to attaching it to the line and then push the fluid through the line once connected.\nAfter the line is backfilled with 5 µL of the vehicle and is working efficiently, load 5 µL of the drug/solution into Hamilton syringe (ink or dye may be used as an alternative to the drug/solution if learning or practicing this technique).\n\t\nEnsure that all vehicle solutions administered onto the dura are maintained at pH 7.4 and measured to an osmolality of 310. This reduces the potential activation of acid-sensing ion channels and other osmosensitive channels within the dura.\nThe maximum volume tested in mice that did not cause leaking into the brain is roughly 10 µL. The behavioral effects after injections with this volume have not been tested. For this reason, administer only 5 µL of the solution onto the dura.\n\t​NOTE: These observations are based on the mouse strains/ages/weights of 6-8 week old CD1/ICR mice.\n2. Dural injections\nOnce the syringe is prepared and the drug is loaded, position a mouse flat onto its abdomen and anesthetize it under brief 3% isoflurane with an oxygen flow rate of 0.5-1 L/min via nosecone.",
    "After the mouse no longer displays a pinch reflex, adjust the anesthesia and sustain it at a 1.5% isoflurane.\nOnce anesthetized, apply sterile opthalmic ointment to the eyes and shave the head of the animal, then disinfect the skin with povidone-iodine and ethanol. Following this, get in a position conducive to a successful injection.\nUse one hand to steady the head of the animal and hold the infuser with the other hand.\nCarefully probe and locate the junction of the sagittal and lambdoidal sutures on the skull of the mouse (Figure 1B, C).\n\t\nTo locate this discreet junction through the skin, use the topographical features of the skull and gently probe the general location of the junction with the infuser.\nVerify the position of the junction by re-positioning the infuser along the skull and feeling for the exact location.\nOnce the suture is located and the infuser is in place, very slowly and gently wiggle the infuser back and forth until it pierces through the skin and drops down into the junction all the way up to the plastic stopper.\n\tNOTE: Ensure to insert the entire 0.6 mm tip of the infuser into the junction.\nTo verify the accuracy, use ink or dye as an injection solution and euthanize and decapitate the mouse.\n\t\nRemove the skull cap to visualize the dye within the dura mater (Figure 1C).\n\t\tNOTE: Dye should not be observed on the brain or exterior of the skull. Likewise, mice in any experiment should be checked post-mortem to verify the accuracy of the injection as well as to ensure the integrity of the dura mater was undamaged.",
    "Following the injection, remove the mouse from anesthesia, wait for it to regain consciousness and then return to its cage or place it into a testing chamber to begin the desired assays.\n\t​NOTE: Allow the mouse to recover from anesthesia for a minimum of 30 min prior to doing any behavioral experiments.\n3. Periorbital von Frey\nBegin the study with a cohort of approximately 16-20 mice.\nOne the day prior to habituation, handle each mouse for at least 5 min.\nApproximately 24 h after handling, habituate the mice to the testing room conditions and the von Frey testing apparatus (Figure 2A).\n\tNOTE: The acrylic testing apparatus consists of individual compartments with lids that are approximately 3 in x 3.5 in x 5 in (W x H x D) and are supported by aluminum stands connected via 0.25 in 19 G square galvanized steel mesh wire.\n\t\nPlace the mice inside a horizontally placed 4-oz white paper cup that is odorless and does not contain polythene or paraffin wax.\n\t\tNOTE: These types of cups are preferred because it reduces gastrointestinal upset in the mice if ingested (Figure 2B).\nWhile the animals are in their respective chambers, place a pellet of the normal chow diet in the individual chamber of each mouse to calm the animals and avoids any unnecessary stress to the animals. Do this for 3 days prior to any von Frey behavior testing.\n\t\nEnsure that every time the mice are in the chamber that there is access to food.\nNumber and assign each animal to the same space in the testing rack. Place the mouse in the same cup every day of the testing period to ensure that each animal becomes acclimated to its testing environment.",
    "NOTE: Mice will gnaw on the cups and subsequently destroy the cups. If this should happen, replace the cup and label it with the corresponding mouse number.\nFollowing the initial 3 days of habituation, place the mice in their individual chambers.\n\t\nAllow the animals to acclimate to the testing room and chambers for at least 1 h prior to any von Frey testing to allow the mice to calm down and subsequently are easier to test.\nAfter acclimation to the room on the testing day, remove one mouse while still in its cup from its respective chamber.\n\t\nMaintain the cup in the horizontal position so that the mouse is on both forepaws and hind paws to help keep their weight evenly distributed.\n\t\tNOTE: Unequal weight distribution may alter animal's responses and even prevent animals from responding.\nPlace the cup with the mouse inside on the table below the testing rack on the absorbent pad.\nFor periorbital von Frey testing, place the 0.07 g von Frey filament directly in the center of the face and between the eyes.\nApply enough pressure on the filament to cause the von Frey hair to bend into a \"C\" shaped formation.\n\t\nMaintain contact with the region at least 3 s but no more than 5 s or until the mouse withdraws its head and swipes at the filament with its paw.\n\t\tNOTE: If the filament slips or more than the tip of the filament touches the animal during testing, any responses should not be counted. These responses may be in response to the brush which are activated by different mechanoreceptors and therefore may not reflect accurate results.\nApply von Frey filaments according to the Dixon \"up-down\" method22,23.",
    "Initially, apply the von Frey filament which has a weight of 0.07 g. The lowest possible filament and the highest tested filament in this study are filaments with weights of 0.008 g and 0.6 g, respectively.\nUse the filaments of weight 0.008 g, 0.02 g, 0.04 g, 0.07 g, 0.16 g, 0.4 g, and 0.6 g to perform this assay.\nIn this method, if an animal does not exhibit a response to the filament, apply the filament of the next higher gram weight.\nIf the mouse does respond to a filament, consider that mouse responsive to that filament. If this is the case, apply the filament of the next lower gram weight.\nRepeat this pattern until the animal is tested 4 times after the initial response or the animal is determined to be unresponsive to any filaments tested in the assay.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: Refrain from applying any additional pressure stemming from the arm or wrist. A scale may be used to practice the application of the filament.\n4. Testing for baseline withdrawal thresholds\nPrior to inclusion in an experiment, ensure that the mice reach a baseline withdrawal threshold between 0.5-0.6 g.\n\t\nA mouse reaches baseline if they fail to respond to any filament tested in the series mentioned in step 3.9.2.2 (0.07 g, 0.16 g, 0.4 g, and 0.6 g).\nTest mice daily when establishing baseline withdrawal thresholds.\n\t\nTesting allows animals to acclimate to the testing conditions and the pressure of the von Frey filaments.\nIf the mice are still extremely hypersensitive after the third day of testing, try waiting 1 or 2 days before testing again.\n\t\tNOTE: Too much time between testing days may result in the animal failing to adjust to the weight of the filament on their periorbital region, thus not reaching the targeted withdrawal threshold.",
    "Test mice for approximately 7 days before determining which animals do not meet the inclusion criteria for an experiment.\n\t​NOTE: Approximately 70% of mice will reach the targeted baseline level.\n\t\nPrior to dural stimulation, analyze the baseline data to exclude any mouse that has not reached a baseline value of 0.5-0.6 grams or higher.\nAfter exclusion, randomly allocate each remaining mouse to a testing group. Achieve this by drawing out of a cup or writing a script on a spreadsheet to randomize numbers to a group.\n5. Analysis of von Frey results\nOnce the series of responses have been obtained, determine the delta, k value, the 50% threshold, and the withdrawal threshold in grams according to previously published methods24.\nCalculate the withdrawal threshold using this formula WT = 10(x*F+B), where WT= withdrawal threshold, F = paw withdrawal threshold calculated via the Chaplan method, and B = linear regression of log (bending force) = x*Filament number + B.\nPlot the data as either 50% withdrawal threshold or average withdrawal threshold in grams.\nSubscription Required.
