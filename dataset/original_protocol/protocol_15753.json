    "The author declares that the protocol follows the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.\n1. Preparation of surgical instruments and stereotaxic frame\nNOTE: The surgery is performed under aseptic conditions. Sterility is maintained using the sterile tip technique.\nInstall the stereotaxic arm with a micropipette or syringe filled with an injectable of choice (adeno-associated virus (AAV) or conventional tracer) on the stereotaxic frame and prepare the mouse adapter (Figure 2A).\nPrepare autoclaved surgical instruments (Table of materials) and place them on a sterile surface.\n2. Anesthesia induction and mouse preparation\nTurn on O2 at 0.5 L/min and set the isoflurane vaporizer at 4.0, making sure that O2 flow is to the induction box.\n\tCAUTION: Make sure that the isoflurane induction box is placed in a hood and that the isoflurane is scavenged away from the surgical site.\nPlace the mouse (10-week-old male C57BL/6J) in the induction chamber.\nOnce breathing has slowed, open the induction chamber, and lift the mouse slightly. Use clippers to remove hair from head to shoulders.\n3. Positioning of the mouse in the stereotaxic frame\nMove the mouse to the stereotaxic frame and place the nose in a flexible nose cone. At this stage, make sure the O2 flow is now directed to the nose cone.\nPlace the mouse in the stereotaxic frame using ear bars only.\n\tNOTE: Make sure the ear bars are even and the head is level.\nAnteroflex the head of the mouse to a 90° angle by manually guiding the nose. To secure this position, place a plastic barrier between the ear bar pillars of the mouse adapter, parallel to the pillars. The flat part of the skull serves as the reference, similar to the flat skull approach in conventional stereotaxic surgery.",
    "NOTE: Do not over flex the head (i.e. beyond an angle of 90° between the plane of the frontal skull bone and the plane of the surface of the table) as this impedes airflow through the upper airway. If airflow is impeded, reposition the mouse, making sure the body is supported underneath the trunk and a plastic card is set at 90° between the plane of the frontal skull bone and the plane of the surface of the table as outlined in Figure 2A,C.\nPlace the heating pad underneath the mouse, and then make sure that the neck and the rest of the body are positioned at the same level (i.e., at approximately 180° or parallel to the table). The toolbox that holds the spring scissors can be used to lift the body to this position.\n\tNOTE: This step is important as the caudal brainstem and upper cervical cord move depending on position, in contrast to more rostral parts of the CNS which are held in place by the skull.\nInject a single dose of 4 mg/kg Meloxicam slow-release (SR) subcutaneously (s.c.) at a volume of 2 µL/g body weight and place lubricant on the eyes.\nClean the surgical incision site first with a 70% alcohol prep pad, then with a betadine prep pad, and then again with an alcohol prep pad and let dry.\nPlace a drape underneath the body.\nDisinfect hands and put on sterile gloves.\nPlace a drape at the surgical site.\n4. Surgery to access the cisterna magna\nMake sure the mouse is appropriately anesthetized by pinching the toes or checking the corneal reflex.\nReduce isoflurane to maintenance levels (2.0).\nMake a 1-1.2 cm incision with surgical blade #10 from the edge of the occipital bone toward the shoulders in one smooth movement.",
    "Make an incision in the midline raphe of the trapezius muscle. This exposes the paired longus capitis muscles.\n\tNOTE: In mice, the trapezius muscle is a very thin, almost transparent muscle. Make sure to stay in the midline and do not cut into the underlying muscles as this will cause unnecessary bleeding.\nPlace both retractor hooks in between the paired longus capitis muscles, one oriented to the left and the other to the right. The weight of the hemostats provides tension to the retractor hooks which can be modified by re-adjusting the position of the hemostats.\nPosition the surgical microscope in place to better visualize the surgical field.\nUse the blunt laminectomy forceps to separate the left and right bellies of the paired longus capitis muscle, starting from the occiput, where the midline is readily visible. Guide the blunt forceps across the bone of the occiput in the midline down to where it meets the cisternal dura mater, and then continue across the dura mater to the atlas.\n\tNOTE: There is no need to cut through the paired longus capitis muscles as nothing holds them together in the midline; doing so will cause unnecessary bleeding.\nReposition the retractors and adjust the tension by repositioning the hemostats, opening the view of the cisterna magna.\nUse the blunt laminectomy forceps to separate the muscles further in the midline to get a good viewing window of the brainstem and cerebellum.\nRepeat steps 4.7-4.9 as needed until the cerebellum and brainstem come in view below the dura.\nUsing blunt laminectomy forceps, clear the dura of the small strands of connective tissue by moving the forceps from the midline in a lateral direction, until there is a clear view of the brainstem and to create more lateral space, as needed for the target.",
    "5. Opening of the cisternal membrane\nUse the angled Dumont forceps (#4/45) to grab the dura, which extends from the occipital bone to the atlas. Grab the dura near the occipital bone and use the spring scissors to make a small opening (~0.5 to 1.5 mm) in the dura.\n\tNOTE: At this rostral location, the space between the brainstem and the overlying dura is widest, providing ample room for safe manipulation of the dura.\nUse the spring scissors to lift the dura and open the dura further. The size of the window depends on the target.\n\tNOTE: A larger window will be needed when making multiple longitudinal injections or bilateral injections; a small window will be sufficient when making single unilateral or midline injections.\nOnce the dura is opened, drain excess cerebrospinal fluid with a sterile cue tip.\n6. Identification of landmarks and zero point\nView the dorsal surface of the brainstem with detailed landmarks through the open dura. The obex, the point where the central canal opens into the IV ventricle, is the standard anterior-posterior and mediolateral zero point.\n7. Target coordinates\nNOTE: For various targets, we have included a list of standard coordinates with anterior posterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) coordinates relative to zero-point bregma and cisterna magna coordinates with AP and ML coordinates relative to zero point obex to facilitate the transition between methodologies (Table 1). Dorsoventral (DV) coordinates are relative to the surface of the brain or cerebellum (standard approach) or the surface of the brainstem or upper cervical cord (cisterna magna approach) at the point of AP and ML entry. Planning should be done prior to surgery.\nUse the three sets of coordinates to determine the target: AP, ML, and DV. Due to the head position, the relative orientation of brainstem structures varies by location.",
    "For target distance >0.4 mm from caudal to the obex (Figure 1B, green) perform the following.\n\t\t\nAP: Use any standard stereotaxic reference atlas (e.g., Paxinos and Franklin atlas2) or tissue series cut in the transverse plane to estimate the AP distance between obex and the target.\nML: Use any standard stereotaxic reference atlas or tissue series cut in the transverse plane to estimate the ML distance between obex and the target.\nDV: Estimate coordinates relative to the surface of the brain or cerebellum at the AP and ML target point. Use any standard stereotaxic reference atlas or tissue series cut in the transverse plane to estimate the distance between the brainstem surface at the desired AP and ML coordinates and the target.\nFor target distance <0.4 mm from caudal to the obex (Figure 1B, orange) perform the following.\n\t\t\nAP: Adjust coordinates to account for anteroflexion of the brainstem. For ventral and rostral coordinates, the AP brainstem entry point will be more caudal relative to the target AP coordinate in the standard plane.\nML: Derive target coordinates from a standard stereotaxic reference atlas or tissue series cut in the transverse plane. Coordinates will be relative to the visualized midline at the target AP level.\nDV: Estimate coordinates relative to the surface of the brainstem at the AP and ML target point. Adjust DV to account for anteroflexion of the brainstem. For ventral and rostral coordinates, the DV coordinates will be larger than the distance from the dorsal surface of the brainstem in the standard plane.\n8. Injection of the target",
    "Lower the pipette or syringe to the target using the stereotaxic arm and inject solution as for standard stereotaxic approaches. Leave in place for 1-5 min after injection, to avoid a needle track when using volumes between 3-50 nL. Then, lift the pipette or syringe using the stereotaxic arm.\nRepeat step 8.1. for multiple targets.\n9. Closure of the surgical field\nRemove the hooks carefully from the surgical field. The paired longus capitis muscles will fall back into a neutral position, fully covering the cisterna magna. Do not close the trapezius muscle and dura mater in the midline as they are too fragile to hold sutures.\nClose the skin with three nylon or polypropylene sutures (5-0 or 6-0).\n10. Post-operative care\nTurn off isoflurane and remove the mouse from the stereotaxic frame. Place the mouse in a clean cage on a heating pad and observe until awake and moving.\nMonitor health status, weight, and sutures on post-operative days 1-3. Remove sutures on day 10 if not already removed.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
