    "Culture of A549 cells in RPMI supplemented with10% FBSThe human NSCLC cell line A549 was authenticated by the ATCC Cell Authentication Service (ATCC, Manassas, VA).A549 cells were grown to 70-80% confluence in a F12K medium mixture containing 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, 50 µg/mL streptomycin, and 10% FBS in a humidified environment at 37°C (in the presence of 5% CO2) in a cell culture incubator.Working with MatrigelThe Matrigel is aliquoted in ice-cold microfuge tubes and stored at -70°C.Before starting the experiment, the required amount of Matrigel is thawed overnight at 4°C. The Matrigel is always kept on ice.Matrigel is a liquid at 4°C and it solidifies at 37°C. So all plasticware and reagents have to be kept ice cold while handling the Matrigel.The thawed Matrigel is a thick viscous liquid. Therefore, the pipette tips should be trimmed at the tip (to increase the diameter of the tip) to transport the Matrigel in/out of microfuge tubes. The tips are trimmed by using a sterile scalpel blade. All microfuge tubes and pipette tips are kept ice cold while handling the Matrigel. In our laboratory, we use ice-cold RPMI as a cooling media. All the pipette tips are dipped into the ice-cooled media to chill them down before using them to handle Matrigel.Spherical Invasion AssayDay 1 Before starting the experiment, draw the schema of the assay as shown in Figure 1. The assay will be set up in an eight-well chamber slide. The yellow region of the side of the chamber slide is used to lift it up and transport it around.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4320/bioprotoc-12-04-4320-g001.jpgFigure 1. Schema of an example spherical invasion assay in an eight well chamber slide. A549 human NSCLC cells were grown to approximately 70-80% confluence in T-75 tissue culture flasks in F-12K supplemented with 10% FBS.",
    "Wash cells once with DPBS and trypsinize them from the flask using 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA.Add 1 mL of FBS to inactivate the Trypsin. Aspirate cells by pipetting up and down gently, and collect them in a 15 mL/50 mL sterile centrifuge tube.Gently spin down the cells at 800 × g for 5 min. Aspirate the media and resuspend the cells in RPMI (containing phenol red)/ 20% FBS.Count the cells using the Corning cell counting chamber. Adjust the concentration of the cells to 50 × 106 cells/mL in RPMI (containing phenol red) containing 20% FBS. This tube is identified as TUBE A.The PP2 was diluted to a concentration of 200 µM in serum-free RPMI (containing phenol red). This stock is always prepared at 20× concentration, where x is the final concentration of the drug in the SIA. The final concentration of PP2 to be used for the SIA is 10 µM. Therefore, the PP2 stock was 200 µM.In a separate microfuge tube, mix the cells (from TUBE A) with PP2 (at a concentration of 200 µM) at a ratio of 10:1 (v/v). This dilutes the PP2 to a concentration of PP2 = 20 µM. For example, you may add 45 µL of cell suspension (from TUBE A) to 5 µL of the PP2. Therefore, the new concentration of PP2 = 20 µM. We will call this TUBE B.Keep a few microfuge tubes on ice to chill them down. Mix the cells with Matrigel at a ratio of 1:1 in an ice-cold microfuge tube. As mentioned in Step 6, the cells are resuspended in RPMI (containing phenol red)/20% FBS. Once the cells are mixed (at a ratio of 1:1) in Matrigel, the final concentration of the media comes down to RPMI (containing phenol red)/10% FBS.",
    "For example, mix 15 µL of Matrigel with 15 µL of cell suspension (taken from TUBE B). Mix the cells with the Matrigel by flicking the tube, making the final PP2 concentration in the tube 10 µM. This tube is referred to as TUBE C.Similarly, 15 µL of untreated control A549 cells were mixed with 15 µL of Matrigel in a separate microfuge tube. This tube is referred to as TUBE D.Take a chamber slide out of the packet. Keep the chamber slide in a dish over a piece of tissue paper. If you keep it directly on the surface of the head, the bottom of the chamber slide tends to stick to the floor of the hood, and it is hard to lift the chamber slide.Take 6 µL of the cell suspension from TUBE C and plate it as a drop in the center of the chamber slide. Each sample is assayed in duplicate. A similar process is followed for TUBE D. The chamber slide is incubated at 37°C for one hour in a cell culture incubator. Figure 2 is a schematic representation of the chamber slide with the drop in the middle of the well.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4320/bioprotoc-12-04-4320-g002.jpgFigure 2. Schema of the first step of the spherical invasion assay in an eight well chamber slide. The cells are mixed with phenol red-containing Matrigel (as a 1:1 suspension) and plated as a drop in the middle of each well of the chamber slide. This drop is represented as a pink circle in the figure above.After 1 h, add 250 µL of RPMI (containing phenol red) with 10% FBS to each well. Leave the chamber slide at 37°C for 24 h in a cell culture incubator.Thaw a vial of phenol red-free Matrigel overnight at 4°C.",
    "If the assay is set up like shown in the schematic diagram above, then we will need 125 µL of phenol red-free Matrigel per well of the chamber slide.Day 2 Dilute the phenol red-free Matrigel with an equal volume of phenol red-free RPMI containing 20% FBS. Keep this solution on ice.Look at the chamber slide under a phase-contrast microscope. The cells are located inside the drop.Aspirate the medium from the chamber slide. Use a pipette to gently remove the medium without disturbing the drop at the center of the chamber slide.Overlay 250 µL of the 1:1 solution of phenol red-free Matrigel (diluted with phenol-red free RPMI supplemented with 20% FBS) over the drop. The schematic diagram of the chamber slide is provided below (Figure 3). The pink color drop represents the primary layer of Matrigel and the light grey region around the pink drop represents the phenol red-free Matrigel. The chamber slide is incubated at 37°C for 1 h in a cell culture incubator. After 1 h, add 250 µL of RPMI (containing phenol red) with 10% FBS to each well. Leave the chamber slide at 37°C for 24 h in a cell culture incubator.We have performed the SIA by adding drugs (in this case PP2) to the secondary layer of Matrigel. However, we have observed that the presence/absence of the drug in the secondary Matrigel layer does not make a substantial difference in the outcome of the assay. Therefore, we do not add the drugs to the secondary layer of Matrigel.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4320/bioprotoc-12-04-4320-g003.jpgFigure 3. Schema of the second step of the spherical invasion assay in an eight-well chamber slide.",
    "The first step involves mixing the cells with phenol red-containing Matrigel (as a 1:1) suspension and plating them as a drop in the middle of each well of the chamber slide (shown as the pink circle in the figure above). In the second step, phenol red-free Matrigel is mixed with phenol red-free RPMI (at a 1:1 volume by volume ratio) and overlaid over the first layer (as shown by the grey region in the figure above).Day 3 Observe the chamber slide under a phase-contrast microscope. The cells are clearly seen invading out radially from the primary Matrigel layer in to the secondary Matrigel layer. The first layer contains a high concentration of A549 cells mixed with phenol-red containing Matrigel. The second layer is made up of phenol-red-free Matrigel and contains no cells. Therefore, the migration of cells from the primary layer to the secondary layer is very clear and distinct. Another factor that helps to make the interface very clear is the fact that two different colored Matrigels are used for creating the primary and secondary layers. The first layer is comprised of A549 cells mixed with phenol-red containing Matrigel. Under a phase-contrast microscope, this layer is red-black in appearance (Figure 4). The second layer is created by using phenol red-free Matrigel and is light pink in color. The interface is always very clear and defined. Photograph three independent fields for each sample.Processing the images using adobe illustrator and ImageJ. Figure 4 shows the representative images obtained from the SIA. The images are photographed at 20× magnification (scale bar = 1 mm). The black arrows indicate the A549 cells which have invaded from the primary to the secondary Matrigel layers.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4320/bioprotoc-12-04-4320-g004.jpgFigure 4. Representative images obtained after performing the SIA, as described in Section C. Open the images in ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR.",
    "Using the pen curvature tool, draw a dotted line across the interface the two layers (Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4320/bioprotoc-12-04-4320-g005.jpgFigure 5. Adobe Illustrator is used to process the images obtained in Figure 4. A dotted line is drawn across the interface of the two layers.Export the images to ADOBE PHOTOSHOP and save them in jpeg format.Open the jpeg files in ImageJ. Using the line tool, draw a set of ten lines tracing the distance that the A549 cells have invaded into the secondary Matrigel layer (Figure 6). After drawing each line, press CTRL-M to obtain the length of the line drawn.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4320/bioprotoc-12-04-4320-g006.jpgFigure 6. The image files obtained in Figure 5 are opened via ImageJ. With the help of the line tool, a set of ten lines tracing the distance that the A549 cells have invaded into the secondary Matrigel layer are drawn.Open GraphPad Prism. Using the numbers obtained by the ImageJ program, create a column graph (Figure 7). Values represented by the symbol * are statistically different relative to control (P < 0.05).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4320/bioprotoc-12-04-4320-g007.jpgFigure 7. After quantifying the microscopy images by the ImageJ program, the data is graphed using GraphPad Prism. Vales represented by the symbol * are statistically significantly different from control (P ≤ 0.05)."
