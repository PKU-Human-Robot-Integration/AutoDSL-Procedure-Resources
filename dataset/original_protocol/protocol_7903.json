    "1. Prepare and Submit a Neutron Facility Beam Time and Instrument Proposal\nConsult online resources for identifying neutron scattering facilities that provide general user neutron beam time access, such as Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). A map of neutron facilities and information about neutron research worldwide is available online.46 Be aware that these facilities typically have regular calls for proposals; this determines when the next beam time will be available. Neutrons are used for a variety of applications; search for small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) instruments, particularly those with capabilities for biological samples.\nUse resources provided by the neutron facilities to help navigate the neutron beam time proposal submission process. Consult with a Neutron Scattering Scientist (NSS) that is associated with the instrument for which you will apply. Review the neutron facility’s current information regarding proposal calls, deadlines, and advice for submission; for Oak Ridge this is available online.47 Submit the beam time proposal following all guidelines for a successful submission.\nIf deuterated protein is required (see 2.2), neutron scattering facilities are often supported by laboratories and expertise dedicated to the production of deuterated materials. To request access to the Bio-Deuteration Lab (BDL) at ORNL, select the BDL as the second instrument in the proposal system. While the SANS proposal is reviewed for feasibility and by a scientific review committee, BDL requests are only screened for feasibility. To help with the BDL feasibility review, submit a completed information request form48 that describes the protein expression protocol and estimated yield (available online).",
    "After successful peer-review of the beam time proposal, confirm the awarded date of beam time in advance of the experiment. Ensure that all sample and buffer details and formulas are listed correctly in the proposal for proper review. Any changes to the proposed experimental plan, including changes in sample and buffer composition, require notification of the facility.\nNOTE: Changes should be discussed as soon as possible with the assigned NSS.\n2. Determine Neutron Contrast Match Points and Necessary Contrast for Protein Measurement\nGather information (from supplier’s product information, online databases, published values, etc.) relating to atomic compositions and volumes for the detergent system components to be contrast-matched. This information is used to determine neutron scattering length densities (SLDs) and thus contrast match points (CMPs) in solution, which is critical to obtaining quality SANS data and structural information for the membrane protein of interest in the context of a PDC. A table summarizing the physical properties and contrast match points for detergents commonly used in biophysical studies of membrane proteins is included (Table 1).\nDetermine neutron SLDs using the web application MULCh: ModULes For The Analysis Of Contrast Variation Data49 (available online50 free-of-charge). A link to the user manual is located on the home page. Access the website and read the accompanying documentation. Figure 1 and Figure 2 provide an overview of Contrast module input and output for two related examples.\nNOTE: Other websites for calculating SLDs are available, such as the one maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Center for Neutron Research.51\nOpen the Contrast module by clicking ‘Contrast’ located in the left navigation pane. Provide text for a project title and enter details below for two components (e.g., detergent head group and tail) as ‘subunit 1’ and ‘subunit 2’.",
    "Enter the molecular formula for each component in the ‘Formula’ text box.\nNOTE: The radio button ‘M’ must be selected under ‘Substance Type’ to enter a molecular formula. Additionally, use the letter ‘X’ in the formula to indicate readily exchangeable hydrogen atoms. Protein, RNA, or DNA sequences can be entered if the corresponding ‘P’, ‘R’, or ‘D’ radio buttons are selected. If multiple copies of a component exist within the subunit, the value for ‘Nmolecules’ can be changed accordingly. A practical example here relates to lipid-like detergents containing two identical tails, allowing the formula for one tail to be entered with Nmolecules equal to 2.\nEnter the volume in cubic Angstroms for each component in the box below ‘Volume (Å3)’. Use Tanford’s formula28 for alkyl chains of length n, Vtail = 27.4 + n * 26.9, to calculate approximate tail volume, or obtain molecular volumes from product information provided or published values in the literature.\nEnter details for buffer components. Change the ‘Number dissolved species in the solvent’ using the dropdown menu to add or remove rows for each buffer component. In the case of micelle-forming detergents, include the free detergent monomers as separate buffer components at the detergent’s critical micelle concentration (CMC).",
    "Click ‘Submit’ to perform the neutron contrast calculations and generate a results page that provides a table of scattering length density and contrast match points as well as formulae for determining these parameters at any given percentage of D2O in the buffer. Review the scattering parameters with particular attention to the component CMPs. If the match points are similar (within 10% D2O) and the free micelle concentration is low, then the average CMP can be used for contrast-matching the detergent contributions. In most cases, the CMP of the detergent head group and tail will differ by more than 10-15%, producing a core-shell form factor in the SANS data which obfuscates direct collection of the scattering signal from the protein alone.\nAssess the contrast between detergent head group and tail. When the detergent head group and alkyl chain tail CMPs are not well-matched, the availability and incorporation of a deuterium-substituted detergent can permit scattering length densities of select components to be manipulated. In most cases, this will require forming a mixed micelle through the incorporation of an identical detergent with deuterium-substituted alkyl chains. The addition of deuterium raises the scattering length density of the core formed by the alkyl chain tails. The desired endpoint, in this case, is such that the head group shell CMP and alkyl chain core CMP have approximately equal values.",
    "Raise the CMP of the detergent micelle core to be approximately equal to the CMP of the head group shell by determining the appropriate ratio of mixing between h-tails and d-tails that achieves complete contrast matching with the head groups. A prerequisite for this determination is knowledge of the CMP for a deuterium-substituted alkyl chain tail. A commercially-available counterpart to n-Dodecyl β-D-maltoside (DDM) is available with all alkyl chain hydrogen replaced by deuterium (d25-DDM). Repeat the contrast calculations outlined in step 2.1 for a ‘d-tail’ in place of the ‘h-tail’.\nCalculate the mole ratio of h-tail to d-tail required for contrast-matching with the head group CMP. The following formula can assist with this determination:\n\t\tCMPhead = CMPh-tail * χh-tail + CMPd-tail * χd-tail\n\t\twhere CMP is the scattering length density and χ is the volume fraction for the detergent head, h-tail, or d-tail component. For buffered solutions of DDM, incorporation of 44% by weight (43% by mole) of the total detergent as d25-DDM with deuterium-substituted alkyl chains produces a single CMP in 48.5% D2O for both head and tail components.\nConsider the degree of deuterium substitution for the membrane protein. To measure sufficient scattering signal from the protein, the CMP for the protein should be at least 15% D2O in solution away from the detergent CMP and measurement conditions. The signal increases with the square of this% difference. Since the CMP of an unlabeled protein typically occurs with ~42% D2O in solution (a CMP similar to many detergent head groups), deuterium labeling of the protein is almost always a necessity.52\n3. Express and Purify the Membrane Protein of Interest\nPrepare LB (lysogeny broth) medium and grow Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells harboring an inducible expression vector for the target protein sequence.",
    "Prepare minimal media. In either H2O or D2O, dissolve 7.0 g/L (NH4)2SO4, 5.25 g/L Na2HPO4, 1.6 g/L KH2PO4, 0.50 g/L diammonium hydrogen citrate, 5.0 g/L glycerol, 1.0 mL/L of 20% w/v MgSO4·7H2O, and 1.0 mL/L of Holme trace metals (0.50 g/L CaCl2·2H2O, 0.098 g/L CoCl2, 0.102 g/L CuSO4, 16.7 g/L FeCl3·6H2O, 0.114 g/L MnSO4·H2O, 22.3 g/L Na2EDTA·2H2O, and 0.112 g/L ZnSO4·H2O).53,54\nPrepare appropriate antibiotic stock solutions using H2O or D2O.\nPrepare an isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside stock solution using H2O or D2O.\nSterile-filter all solutions into dry, sterile containers using bottle-top vacuum and syringe filters with a 0.22 micron pore size.\nAdapt E. coli cells to deuterium-labeled medium prior to scale-up for overexpression of a deuterated protein.\n\t\nInoculate 3 mL of LB medium with an isolated colony from a Lysogeny Broth (LB) agar plate or cells from a frozen glycerol stock. Grow cells at 37 °C in a shaking incubator at 250 RPM or reduce the temperature to 30 °C or below to avoid overgrowth of the culture when incubating overnight.\nNOTE: The adaptation procedure can be varied.55,56,57\nOnce the LB culture has grown to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of ~1, dilute it 1:20 in 3 mL of H2O minimal medium and grow to an OD600 of ~1. Repeat the 1:20 dilutions using minimal medium containing 50, 75 and 100% D2O (or up to the desired D2O percentage).\nNOTE: As the D2O content is increased, growth rates will decrease. The relationship between the D2O percentage in the growth media and deuterium substitution in the protein has been reported in the literature.58,59,60\nContinue growing the culture in a bioreactor to increase the yield of deuterated cell mass (Figure 3).\nNOTE: Step-by-step procedures for bioreactor operation have been reviewed elsewhere.61,62,63,64\nHarvest and lyse E. coli cells for membrane extraction and protein purification",
    "Pellet the cells by centrifugation at ~6,000 x g for ~30-45 min at 4 °C.\nSoften the cell pellet by soaking in buffer on ice for ~30 min. Then, gently resuspend the cell pellet in buffer by gently pipetting with a serological pipet, or gentle rocking on a 2D rocker, to a final concentration of ~1 g wet cell mass/10 mL buffer.\nNOTE: An example buffer is 50 mM HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid), pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl supplemented with a protease inhibitor tablet.\nLyse resuspended cells with three passes through a high-pressure homogenizer at 10,000 psi while chilling the outflow.\nNOTE: Depending on the scale required, other lysis methods may be used (e.g., by French press or sonication).\nPellet cell debris by centrifugation at ~4,000 - 5,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. Repeat this step until the supernatant is clarified.\nUltracentrifuge (~150,000 x g for 30-45 min) the supernatant from the prior step, which contains the soluble and membrane fractions. The pellet after ultracentrifugation contains the membrane fraction.\nResuspend the membrane pellet in a large Dounce homogenizer and isolate the membrane fraction again by ultracentrifugation (step 3.3.5). Repeat this step at least once to remove loosely bound proteins.\nSolubilize membranes by gentle rocking for ~30 min at 4 °C in a buffer containing detergent suitable for purification. Solubilization is apparent when the suspension turns from cloudy to transparent. Remove insoluble material by ultracentrifugation (~150,000 x g for 30-45 min).\nNOTE: An example buffer is 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole and 4% (w/v) DDM for purification by Ni2+ affinity chromatography.\nPurify the protein following a protocol previously developed for protonated forms.",
    "NOTE: See Naing et al. for an example purification protocol for a hexahistidine tagged M. marisnigri JR1 intramembrane aspartyl protease (d-MmIAP).65 The final yield was ~ 1 mg of deuterated from 5 L deuterated cell culture growth, all of which was used in the SANS experiment (Figure 4).\nExchange the purified protein into the “Final Exchange Buffer” for contrast matching.\n\t\nPrepare 200 mL of “Final Exchange Buffer” containing the correct mixture for contrast matching, e.g.,20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, and 0.05% total DDM (0.028% DDM and 0.022% d25-DDM) in 49% D2O.\nEquilibrate a size exclusion column with >2 column volumes (CV) of “Final Exchange Buffer” in 3.5.1 using a Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) system.\nAfter injecting the sample, run the column and isolate fractions corresponding to the protein of interest.\nConcentrate the protein to the desired final concentration (2 - 5 mg/mL).\nNOTE: A volume of ~300 μL is required to fill a 1 mm cylindrical quartz cuvette used for SANS.\nReserve an aliquot of matched buffer for SANS background subtraction.\nNOTE: The aliquot can be taken directly from the prepared buffer, or ideally from a clean elution fraction at the end of the FPLC run.\n4. Make Final Preparations for Beam Time and Collect SANS Data\nAfter the proposal has been accepted and site access has been approved, complete all required training in advance of assigned beam time. This includes prearrival, web-based training as well as on-site radiological, laboratory, and instrument-specific training.\nNOTE: Training requirements may dictate advance arrival for first time users. More information is available online.66\nLoad samples and buffers for data collection.\nNOTE: An overview of the biological small-angle neutron scattering (Bio-SANS) instrument sample environment area is shown in Figure 5.",
    "Load samples and buffers into quartz cells. Quartz cells are available from the instrument scientist or facility. Use gel-loading tips to access the narrow opening of most sample cells.\nEnsure that the beam shutter is closed, then approach the sample environment area and place the quartz cells in the sample changer. Record the sample changer position for each sample cell.\nCheck the area and ensure the beam path is free from obstruction, then leave the sample environment area and open the beam shutter.\nNOTE: Carefully follow all facility rules and regulations, obey all postings, and heed advice of the instrument scientist. Samples may not be removed from the beam and manipulated after exposure to the beam without following special precautions. Consult with a Radiological Control Technician (RCT) prior to these procedures.\nExecute table scan for automated data collection\n\t\nOperate the instrument through custom control LabVIEW-based software, Spectrometer Instrument Control Environment (SpICE). Follow instructions for instrument operation provided by the Neutron Scattering Scientist. An overview of the table scan operation windows is provided in Figure 6.\nAfter entering the information required in the appropriate areas, execute the table scan and an automated data collection process will begin. Monitor progress via the ‘Table Scan Status’ tab.\n5. Reduce SANS Data from 2D Image to 1D Plot\nIdentify each sample and buffer data file from the recorded scan numbers. Each measurement will be assigned a unique scan number. This information is helpful during data reduction to identify each corresponding sample and buffer pair.\nUse MantidPlot software and Python script for reduction\n\t\nNeutron Scattering Users are provided with account details to access their data on the Remote Analysis Cluster.67 Log in to the Remote Analysis Cluster and execute “MantidPlot” from the command line. Figure 7 and Figure 8 are provided to assist these steps.",
    "Obtain a User Reduction Script from the Neutron Scattering Scientist (this will usually happen during the experiment); this script is Python-based and will contain all the necessary calibration and scaling adjustments to reduce the 2D scattering image into a 1D plot of scattered intensities as a function of scattering angle, I(Q).\nOpen the provided User Reduction Script in MantidPlot and place the corresponding scan numbers or identification for the sample and buffer pairs in the appropriate list.\nExecute the script to generate reduced data as a four-column text file (column order is Q, I(Q), I(Q) error, Q error) in the specified location. Right click the appropriate workspace in MantidPlot and select “Plot with errors…” for an initial examination of the scattering profiles.\n6. Analyze Data for Structural Parameters of the Scattering Particle\nTransfer the reduced data file from the analysis server to a local computer using secure FTP file transfer. This can be performed with the use of software such as FileZilla or CyberDuck. Additional instructions and details for connecting to the analysis server file system are provided on the analysis.sns.gov login page.\nDownload the ATSAS software suite65,68 (whole ATSAS suite).69 Individual programs70 are also available online for analyzing the SANS data, namely determining structural parameters and ab initio models.\nNOTE: Many options are available for SANS data analysis of biomacromolecules.45\nUse PRIMUS71 for data plotting, buffer scaling and subtraction, and Guinier analysis.\n\t\nLaunch the ATSAS ‘SAS Data Analysis’ application and load the reduced data files corresponding to the sample and buffer pair.",
    "To scale the buffer properly, select a data range at high Q (Q > 0.5 Å-1) where both profiles are similar and flat, and click the ‘Scale’ button located under the ‘Operations’ tab. A scale factor will be applied to the buffer such that these two flat regions should overlap. Use caution: there should be a plausible physical reason that justifies scaling the buffer intensity to match the sample. If the discrepancy is large, consult an instrument scientist for valid approaches to background subtraction.44,45,72\nIncrease the data range to view all points. Click ‘Subtract’ to perform this operation. Right click the buffer-subtracted datafile in the legend and save this file for subsequent analysis. Figure 9 outlines the use of the ‘Operations’ tab.\nPerform a Guinier analysis of the buffer-subtracted sample data using the ‘Analysis’ tab of the ‘SAS Data Analysis’ application.\n\t\t\nBe sure the proper file is selected in the list and click ‘Radius of Gyration’. An automated attempt to perform a Guinier fit will be provided by clicking on the ‘Autorg’ button.\nExpand the range of data used to include all of the low-Q data and begin narrowing the data range by taking away high-Q points until the Qmax*Rg limit is below 1.3. Use the plot of residuals to verify that data are linear in the fit range. The Guinier fit yields an approximate Rg and I0 for the scattering particles.\nMake small adjustments to the fit region and monitor the sensitivity of these values to the range of data used in the fit.

    "NOTE: DAMMIF76 and DAMMIN77 within the ATSAS software suite is used to reconstruct dummy atom models (DAMs) using a simulated annealing process from the GNOM output, which contains P(r) data, or information about the probability or frequency of interatomic distances within the scattering particle. These programs may be run in batch mode or on the ATSAS-Online web server.\nStart the PRIMUS Shape Wizard from the ‘Dammif’ button on the ‘Analysis’ tab of ‘SAS Data Analysis’, and use a manual selection of parameters. The input for the wizard is illustrated in Figure 12.\n\t\nDefine the Guinier range from the fit (step 6.3.2) and proceed to the next step using the navigation buttons. Define fit values from the P(r) plot (step 6.4) and proceed to the next step.\nProvide parameters for the ab initio modeling process. Enter a prefix for the model output filenames (e.g., SANSEnvelope), choose either ‘fast’ or ‘slow’ mode modeling, enter a value for the number of models (17 recommended for statistical significance), select from available options for particle symmetry, anisometry, and angular scale (if known). Ensure that the boxes are checked to average models with DAMAVER and refine the final model with DAMMIN.\nInitiate the process using the ‘commit’ button. Once the process is complete, view and save the working directory.\nNOTE: The typical modeling process for a single, small protein can take up to a few hours with a typical personal computer. Files are stored in temporary directories until saved.",
    "Overlay and superimpose the final SANS envelope with a related high-resolution model using SUPCOMB within ATSAS. Place a copy of the high-resolution PDB model to be fit to the SANS envelope in the working directory. Execute SUPCOMB from the command line using the PDB filenames as two arguments with the template structure listed first: $ supcomb HiRes.pdb SANSEnvelope.pdb\nNOTE: The second filename listed will be rewritten as a new file with an “r” appended to the end and having new coordinates for superimposition on the template structure.\nVisualize the ab initio model results using PyMOL (pymol.org), a 3D molecular graphics viewing program. Figure 13 provides an overview of the PyMOL operations.\nNOTE: There are publication guidelines for structural modeling of small-angle scattering data from biomolecules in solution.78\nLaunch the PyMOL application and open the .pdb files corresponding to the 3D SANS envelope and the SUPCOMB-aligned high-resolution structure to be viewed.\nVisualize the SANS envelope by representing this model as a surface.
