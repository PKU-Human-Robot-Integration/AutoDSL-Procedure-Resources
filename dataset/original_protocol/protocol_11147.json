    "All experiments involving human-derived materials were performed under the Declaration of Helsinki and approved in advance by the ethics committee of Fukushima Medical University (approval numbers 1953 and 2192; approval dates March 18, 2020, and May 26, 2016, respectively). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients who provided the clinical specimens used in this study.\n1. Culture of PDOs\nNOTE: F-PDOs form cell clusters that exhibit a variety of heterogeneous morphologies and grow in suspension culture (Figure 1). Furthermore, F-PDOs can be cultured for more than 6 months and can be cryopreserved for future use.\nThawing of stored PDOs (day 0)\n\t\nThaw and seed PDOs (e.g., RLUN007, lung adenocarcinoma) on day 0 (Figure 1). First, add 15 mL of medium for PDOs (see Table of Materials) containing 1% of B-27 supplement and 30 ng/mL of epidermal growth factor to a sterile 50 mL centrifuge tube.\nAfter removing the frozen vial from liquid nitrogen storage, gently agitate the PDOs in a 37 °C water bath for 2 min. Next, remove the vial from the water bath, wipe the vial with 70% ethanol, and then move the vial into a biological safety cabinet.\nTransfer the contents of the vial to the tube containing 15 mL of medium for PDOs. Mix the PDOs and medium by gently pipetting up and down five times with a 3 mL transfer pipette. Centrifuge the tube at 200 x g for 3 min at ~25 °C and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the PDO pellet in 5 mL of fresh medium and transfer to a 25 cm2 flask (see Table of Materials) with gentle pipetting. Finally, culture the PDOs in an incubator at 37 °C in 5% CO2.",
    "Change the medium twice per week (days 3-7). Centrifuge the PDO suspension to precipitate the cell clusters, and replace 4 mL of the medium (80% volume). Resuspend the cells in the fresh medium.\n\tNOTE: The majority of RLUN007 appear as cell clusters that are 100-500 µm in diameter. When the color of phenol red in the medium changes to yellow as shown in Figure 1A, replace the medium more frequently. If the medium turns yellow on the day following replacement, and each cell cluster merges to form larger clusters that are >500 µm in diameter, passage at a split ratio of 1:2.\nSubculture (days 8-28) of PDOs\n\t​NOTE: Given the difficulty of actually measuring the number of single cells, the timing of passage is determined based on an appropriate cell cluster density and the size of the PDO pellet after centrifugation (Figure 1B). In the case of RLUN007, the volume of the PDO pellet reaches 30 µL (saturated density in 25 cm2 flasks) approximately 2 weeks after thawing.\n\t\nFor the transfer from one 25 cm2 flask to two 25 cm2 flasks (P1), transfer the PDO suspension into a centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 200 x g for 2 min at approximately 25 °C. Estimate the volume of the PDO pellet, and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the PDO pellet using a 5 mL pipette in 5 mL of fresh medium. Pipette gently up and down five times at low speed. Then, transfer half of the volume of the PDO suspension (2.5 mL) into two flasks, and add 2.5 mL of fresh medium to each flask. Culture the cells at 37 °C in 5% CO2.",
    "For the transfer from two 25 cm2 flasks to one 75 cm2 flask (P2), transfer the PDO suspension from two flasks into two centrifuge tubes and centrifuge the PDO at 200 x g for 2 min at approximately 25 °C. Next, estimate the volume of the PDO pellet and resuspend the pellet in 2.5 mL of fresh medium (per tube). Thereafter, combine the PDO suspension in one tube with that in the other and transfer it to a 75 cm2 flask containing 10 mL of fresh medium. Culture the cells at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Transfer the sub cultured PDOs from two 25 cm2 flasks to one 75 cm2 flask approximately 1 week after the first passage (Figure 1C).\n2. Growth inhibition HTS\nNOTE: The growth inhibitory activity of anticancer agents against PDOs is evaluated by measuring the intracellular ATP content, as shown in Figure 2. This step is performed using a commercially available cell viability assay kit (see Table of Materials).\nOn day 0, culture the PDOs (e.g., RLUN007) in flasks until adequate numbers of cell clusters are available for the assay. One day before seeding, transfer the PDO suspension from a 75 cm2 flask to a 15 mL tube and centrifuge at 200 x g for 2 min to measure the PDO pellet volume. Then, resuspend the PDO pellet in 15 mL of fresh medium and transfer it back to a 75 cm2 flask. Culture the cells at 37 °C in 5% CO2.\n\tNOTE: The required PDO pellet volume depends on each PDO's dilution rate and the number of 384-well plates used for the assay. For RLUN007, a 200 µL of cell pellet volume is necessary for seeding into ten 384-well plates.",
    "On day 1 (24 h after changing the medium), mince the PDOs using cell fragmentation and dispersion equipment (see Table of Materials) with a filter holder containing a 70 µm mesh filter. Then, dilute 15 mL of the PDO suspension by 10x. Seed 40 µL of the PDO suspension into 384-well ultra-low attachment spheroid (round-bottom) microplates (see Table of Materials) using a cell suspension dispenser (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: For mincing cell clusters, it is recommended to use the commercially available cell fragmentation and dispersion equipment (see Table of Materials).\nAt 24 h after seeding (day 2), treat the PDOs with 0.04 µL of test agent solutions at final concentration ranges of 20 µM to 1.0 nM (10 serial dilutions) using a liquid handler (see Table of Materials).\nOn day 8 (144 h after test substance treatment), add intracellular ATP measuring reagent to the test wells. Mix the plates using a mixer and incubate for 10 min at 25 °C. Measure the intracellular ATP content as luminescence using a plate reader (see Table of Materials).\nTo calculate the cell viability, divide the quantity of ATP in the test wells by that in the control wells containing the vehicle, with the background subtracted. To calculate the growth rate over 6 days, divide the quantity of ATP in the vehicle control wells by that in the vehicle control wells 24 h after seeding.",
    "Calculate the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) and area under the curve (AUC) values from the dose-response curves using biological data analysis software (see Table of Materials). The Z factor is a dimensionless parameter that ranges from 1 (infinite separation) to <0, defined as Z = 1 - (3σc+ + 3σc-) / |µc+ - µc-|, where σc+, σc-, µc+, and µc- are the standard deviations (σ) and averages (µ) of the high (c+) and low (c−) controls14, respectively.\n3. HTS with a cell picking and imaging system for growth inhibition\nNOTE: If there is a large deviation (when the coefficient of variation [CV] at assay is more than 20%) in the data using protocol 2, PDOs of a selected size may be seeded into 96-well or 384-well plates using a cell picking and imaging system (Figure 2). The protocol is the same as that described in steps 2.1 and 2.2 in the previous section. This step is performed using a commercially available cell picking and imaging system (see Table of Materials).\nOn day 1, set a 384-well ultra-low attachment spheroid microplate with 40 µL of medium/well as a destination plate on the cell picking and imaging system.\nFill the picking chamber (see Table of Materials) with 6 mL of culture medium and centrifuge at 1,500 x g for 2 min to remove air bubbles. Add the PDOs suspended in the medium (PDO pellet volume, 4 µL) to the picking chamber and set on the system.\nStand the chamber for at least 1 minute, followed by dispersion, so that the cell clusters settle at the bottom of the chamber; then, perform scanning of the chamber.",
    "Set the picking size to 140-160 µm (area 15,386-20,000 µm2) on the system for automatic selection of cell clusters. Next, check the quality of the selected cell clusters on the scanned images and transfer ten cell clusters per well using picking tips (see Table of Materials) into the destination plate.\nPerform the protocol steps from step 2.3 onward.\n4. HTS for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity\nNOTE: This step is performed using a commercially available system (see Table of Materials), which is an electrical impedance measuring instrument. It is used to evaluate cytolysis of PDOs by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) with monoclonal antibodies and natural killer (NK) cells (Figure 3). NK cells are produced from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using the NK cell production kit (see Table of Materials), following the manufacturer's instructions.\nMeasurement of ADCC activity\n\t\nOn day 0, coat a 96-well plate (see Table of Materials) with 50 µL of 10 µg/mL fibronectin solution (0.5 µg/well) at 4 °C overnight.\nOn day 1, after removing the fibronectin solution, add 50 µL of the culture medium to each well to measure the background impedance.\nPrior to seeding, add 5 mL of cell culture dissociation reagent (see Table of Materials) to the PDOs (RLUN007: 100 µL of the PDO pellet in a 75 cm2 flask) and incubate in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 20 min to disperse the PDOs. To stop trypsinization, add 5 mL of medium, centrifuge and remove the dissociation reagent. Rinse the PDOs with fresh medium and filter through a 40 µm cell strainer (see Table of Materials).\nCount the number of cells using a cell viability analyzer (see Table of Materials).",
    "Transfer the PDO suspension to a reservoir and mix using a multi-channel pipettor. Add the PDO suspension into wells at 5 x 104 cells/well in a 96-well plate. Each well contains a final volume of 100 µL. Then, place the plate in a biological safety cabinet at approximately 25 °C for 30 min.\nTransfer the plate to the instrument in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Record changes in the impedance signals every 15 min as the cell index.\nThaw the NK cells in a 37 °C water bath on the same day as the PDO seeding. Transfer the cells from the vial to a 15 mL tube containing 10 mL of medium for NK cells (see Table of Materials) and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at approximately 25 °C. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 10 mL of fresh medium. After cell counting, adjust the cell density to 1 x 106 cells/mL and transfer to a 75 cm2 flask. Culture the NK cells in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C.\nOn day 2, prepare the antibody solutions (phosphate-buffered saline) at 10 times the final concentration in sterile V-bottom 96-well plates.\nRemove 60 µL of medium from each well, and add 10 µL of trastuzumab or cetuximab solution (10 µg/mL, 1 µg/mL, and 0.1 µg/mL) to the PDOs. Transfer the plates back to the instrument in an incubator and record the cell index for 1 h.\nTransfer the NK cell suspension into a 50 mL tube and count the cell number. Centrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 5 min and adjust the NK cell density to 1 x 106 cells/mL and 2 x 106 cells/mL with the medium for the PDOs.",
    "Add 50 µL of NK cell suspension to the effector (NK) cells at a target (RLUN007) cell ratio of 1:1 or 2:1. The final concentrations of the antibodies are 1 µg/mL, 0.1 µg/mL, and 0.01 µg/mL. Keep the plate at approximately 25 °C for 15 min, and return the plates to the instrument.\nData collection and analysis\n\t\nConvert the cell index to percent cytolysis values using analysis software (see Table of Materials).\nThe percent cytolysis refers to the percentage of target cells killed by NK cells versus target cells (PDOs) alone as a control. Subtract the cell indices of the wells containing only NK cells from the index of the sample wells at each time point. Normalize each value to the cell index immediately before the addition of antibodies. Convert the normalized cell index to percent cytolysis using the following equation: % cytolysis = (1 - normalized cell index [sample wells]) / normalized cell index (target alone wells) x 100."
