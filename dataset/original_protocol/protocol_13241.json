    "This protocol follows the guidelines of the institutional human research ethics committee at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.\n1. Patient selection\nConsider VA-ECMO in patients with refractory CS as a bridge to recovery when the myocardial function is anticipated to improve following the initial insult, as a bridge to decision-making, or as a bridge to a more definitive therapy such as durable LVAD or cardiac transplantation when myocardial dysfunction is irreversible.\n\tNOTE: Various indications include CS secondary to AMI, end-stage heart failure, fulminant myocarditis, and cor pulmonale due to massive PE13,14,15,16,17. Another area of growing use is in patients undergoing cardiac surgery who develop refractory post cardiotomy CS18.\nUtilize VA-ECMO in selected patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest secondary to refractory ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia for cardiopulmonary support as a part of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR).\n\tNOTE: Limited evidence suggests that ECPR is associated with improved survival and is now incorporated in guidelines for CPR19,20.\nRefrain from using VA-ECMO in scenarios involving severe irreversible end-organ failure that limits survival, such as advanced malignancy, brain injury, aortic dissection, and when the patient's goals of care do not align with the use of MCS21.\n\t​NOTE: Some relative contraindications include peripheral vascular disease hindering cannulation, uncontrolled bleeding, or a contraindication to the use of anticoagulants. Old age (>70 years) is not an absolute contraindication; however, this population historically has shown poor in-hospital survival compared to younger adults22.\n2. Cannulation and initiation of VA-ECMO\nFacilitate an interdisciplinary team-based discussion comprising advanced heart failure specialists, interventional cardiologists, cardio-thoracic surgeons, and critical care intensivists prior to initiating CS patients on VA-ECMO23.\nPerform the cannulation in the cardiac catheterization laboratory, the emergency department, or the intensive care unit for a percutaneous approach (peripheral cannulation), or in the operating room for a surgical approach (central cannulation)24.",
    "For the percutaneous approach, clean and prepare the access sites using an antiseptic solution such as chlorhexidine.\nUnder ultrasound guidance, obtain femoral venous access using a modified Seldinger technique with a needle and place a 5 Fr micro sheath25.\nAdvance a flexible J tip guidewire (0.038 in x 180 cm) through the femoral vein into the inferior vena cava (IVC) and direct it to the right atrium.\nDilate the venous access site using sequential dilators to serially dilate the cannula passage, stepping up by one dilator (2 Fr sizes). Then place an appropriately sized venous cannula (single lumen).\n\tNOTE: The size of the cannula is determined based on the age, sex, and diameter of the vessel on the ultrasound, as well as the desired flows. The venous cannula is available in 21 Fr to 25 Fr sizes, and a 25 Fr cannula will usually suffice for most adults.\nConfirm the tip of the venous cannula is at the junction of the intrahepatic portion of the IVC and the right atrium with fluoroscopy or plain X-ray.\nObtain arterial access, usually in the contralateral femoral artery, in a similar fashion using the modified Seldinger technique and then place a micro sheath (5 Fr).\nAdvance a flexible J-tip guidewire (0.038 in X 180 cm) or a stiff guidewire into the common femoral artery and then into the aorta.\nPlace an arterial cannula of appropriate size (15-21 Fr) after the progressive dilation of skin and subcutaneous tissue with dilators.\n\tNOTE: The cannula size is selected to provide a cardiac index of >2.4 L/min/m2. A 19 Fr arterial cannula will provide sufficient support for most adults; however, for smaller females, a smaller size cannula should be used.",
    "Place a distal perfusion catheter (DPC) for antegrade perfusion in the ipsilateral superficial femoral artery by the modified Seldinger technique usinga micro-puncture needle. Introduce a 5 Fr DPC and attach it to the side port of the arterial cannula using 6-7\" extension tubing26.\n\tNOTE: Progressively larger size arterial cannulae increase the risk of ischemic complications in the ipsilateral limb, especially in patients with underlying peripheral vascular disease.\nSecure both venous and arterial cannulae in place by suturing them to the skin with nonabsorbable 2.0 silk sutures.\n\tNOTE: Central cannulation is routinely done in the operating room and typically requires sternotomy.\nPerform direct cannulation of the right atrium and aorta after thoracotomy. Secure these in place using purse-string 4.0 prolene sutures, snuggers, and spigots.\nThen, fix the cannulae to the chest wall from within the cavity using multiple sutures.\nLeave the chest open with an occlusive dressing or closed at the conclusion. Tunnel the cannulae through the skin when the chest is closed.\nConnect the cannulae (arterial and venous) to the ECMO circuit and increase the blood flow until respiratory and hemodynamic parameters are achieved.\n3. Post initiation management\nPatient monitoring\n\t\nPlace a 7.5 Fr pulmonary artery catheter to aid clinical decision-making with periodic measurements of the pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure as a surrogate for left ventricular filling pressures.\n\t\tNOTE: This helps in identifying patients who are at risk of developing pulmonary edema, since VA-ECMO creates a right-to-left shunt by draining venous blood from the right atrium and returning oxygenated blood to the iliac arteries/descending aorta. While preload is reduced, an increase in afterload with VA-ECMO can increase the risk of pulmonary edema in patients with CS who already have an underlying LV dysfunction.",
    "Place the arterial lines in the right radial or left radial arteries using the micropuncture technique with the help of guidewire27.\n\t\tNOTE: This helps determine the location of the watershed (area in the aortic arch where the antegrade flow from the left ventricle meets the retrograde flow from the arterial cannula)28.\nMonitor the oxygen saturations from the right radial artery site to assess upper body (cerebral and right upper extremity) oxygenation. Perform arterial blood gas analysis every 8-12 h to ensure adequate oxygenation29.\nAdjust FiO2 on the oxygenator (dial up the knob) to maintain 60-100 mmHg PaO2.\n\t\tNOTE: FiO2 is usually set at 100% at the initiation of VA-ECMO and is subsequently titrated down as oxygenation improves.\nOptimize the ventilation and, thus, carbon dioxide removal by adjusting the sweep speed to between 3-7 L/min to correct for any respiratory acidosis.\nSerially monitor markers of end-organ perfusion such as lactate, SvO2, transaminases, and creatinine clearance by venous gas analysis30,31.\n\t\tNOTE: Goal SvO2 should be >70% and lactate less than 2.2 mmol/L.\nAdjusting the flow and management of venous chatter\n\t\nAdjust the flow through the circuit to allow for adequate end-organ perfusion (target flow of 60 cc/kg/min). Change the flow by adjusting the speed of the pump. Maintain a flow of 4-6 L/min initially after cannulation.\n\t\tNOTE: Higher speeds of the pump, hypovolemia, and malpositioned venous cannula can lead to venous chatter, which manifests as suctioning or \"chugging\" of the venous cannula32. Venous chatter can lead to hemolysis by causing a vacuum in the pump head, as the rotor in the pump continues to spin and evacuate blood from the pump.",
    "Correct the venous chatter by fluid resuscitation in cases of hypovolemia. Reposition the venous cannula in case of malpositioning or kinking. Reduce the speed of the pump in case of high speed33,34.\nMinimize the venous chatter by attaching a venous reservoir or a collapsible bladder to the inflow cannula. This allows to reduce suctioning of the inflow cannula by providing volume to the pump.\nLeft ventricular unloading\n\tNOTE: An increase in afterload from the retrograde VA-ECMO flow can lead to a higher LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and thus worsen pulmonary edema, and and severe cases of LV standstill may lead to thrombus formation from stagnated blood35.\n\t\nTo unload the LV and decrease afterload, utilize inotropes such as dobutamine (starting dose of 1-2 µg/kg/min) or vasodilators such as hydralazine or nitrates36,37,38.\n\t\tNOTE: However, these are usually insufficient, and mechanical unloading of LV may be required.\nPlace a ventricular support device (e.g., Impella) or intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) percutaneously to accomplish direct unloading of the LV. To accomplish indirect unloading of the LV, place a pulmonary artery cannula percutaneously or perform balloon septostomy.\n\t\tNOTE: Surgical techniques, including transseptal left atrial drainage or direct cannulation of the LV apex, can also be employed for LV unloading39.\nAnticoagulation\n\t\nInitiate systemic anticoagulation at the time of cannulation. Use a bolus of 50-100 IU/kg of IV heparin (recommended) followed by continuous heparin as below.\nContinue unfractionated heparin to maintain an activated partial thromboplastin time or activated clotting time of at least 1.5 times the upper limit of normal during lab checks (every 4-6 h).\nIn patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, use direct thrombin inhibitors such as bivalirudin (starting dose of 0.025-0.05 mg/kg/h)40 or argatroban (starting dose of 0.05-2 µg/kg/min)41 to reach therapeutic levels.\n4. Prevention and management of complications\nHarlequin (North-South) syndrome",
    "NOTE: Differential cyanosis of the upper body can occur when the watershed (the area where retrograde flow containing oxygenated blood from the outflow cannula meets antegrade blood the from LV) is distal to the origin of aortic arch branch vessels in the setting of concomitant respiratory failure. Deoxygenated blood from the LV supplies the upper body through the carotid and subclavian arteries, while the lower body is supplied by the blood from the outflow cannula of VA-ECMO. This phenomenon is called Harlequin syndrome or North-South syndrome (the upper body is blue, and the lower body is pink).\n\t\nManage this differential cyanosis by increasing the oxygen saturation of blood returning to the LV by either increasing the FiO2 or positive end-expiratory pressure if the patient is on mechanical ventilation or by returning oxygenated blood to the right atrium, typically through another cannula introduced in the internal jugular vein connected to the arterial limb of the ECMO circuit (V-A-V ECMO).\nMonitor the upper body oxygenation saturation every 8-12 h with arterial gas analysis (ABG) from the right radial artery. Adequate tissue oxygenation is ensured with 60-100 mmHg of PaO2 on ABG42.\nLower limb ischemia\n\tNOTE: One of the most serious complications of peripheral arterial cannulation is antegrade ischemia in the lower extremity that rarely leads to compartment syndrome and, in extreme situations, may require amputation43. The incidence of limb ischemia is variable, ranging from 10% to 70%, as reported by different studies44.\n\t\nChoose an appropriate size cannula based on the diameter of the femoral arteries on the ultrasound, thus potentially decreasing lower limb ischemic complications.\nMonitor lower limb circulation following cannulation using serial pulse doppler or near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)44. NIRS is a non-invasive imaging tool to access tissue oxygentaion45.",
    "Perform continuous assessment of lower extremity tissue oxygenation using NIRS. Place the sensor pads on calf muscles connected to an oximeter to readily detect any change in tissue oxygenation, which is an indicator of perfusion.\nInsert an antegrade perfusion catheter (5-7 Fr) in the superficial femoral artery at the time of ECMO cannulation to prevent ischemic complications in the lower extremity.\nBleeding and hemolysis\n\tNOTE: A small degree of hemolysis is common after VA-ECMO initiation. Causes of significant hemolysis include pump thrombosis and clotting in the ECMO circuit.\n\t\nCarefully monitor for clinically significant hemolysis. Measure hemoglobin levels, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, and creatinine daily.\nConsider interrupting systemic anticoagulation in patients with severe bleeding and thrombocytopenia46. However, this may increase the risk of thrombotic complications; thus, careful assessment of bleeding and thrombotic risks should be done prior to holding anticoagulation.\nAir embolism\n\tNOTE: Air entrapment in the ECMO circuit can occur from loose connections, peripheral or central venous access, or rupture of the oxygenator membrane47. It can lead to air embolism, which can cause a stroke if air bubbles enter cerebral circulation.\n\t\nLay the patient in the Trendelenburg position while on ventilatory support and clamp the ECMO circuit to manage air embolism\nDe-air and re-prime the circuit when air embolism is suspected. Occasionally, the entire circuit may need replacement.\n5. Weaning from ECMO\nAssess the patients for weaning once they have recovered from the initial insult that prompted the use of VA-ECMO.\n\tNOTE: Concomitant respiratory failure must have been resolved prior to weaning.\nPerform serial echocardiograms to assess for improvement in cardiac function and readiness for weaning.\nConfirm hemodynamic stability prior to weaning a patient from VA-ECMO.",
    "NOTE: Patients must have recovered pulsatile arterial waveform for at least 24 h, and the mean arterial pressure should be >60 mmHg in the absence of or with low dose vasopressor use48.\nWhile weaning, perform an echocardiographic turndown study, where the ECMO flow is gradually decreased to a minimum of 1-1.5 L/min. Ensure hemodynamic stability and assess cardiac function on an echocardiogram.\n\tNOTE: Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction of >20%-25%, aortic velocity-time integral of >10 cm, and lateral mitral annulus peak systolic velocity of >6 cm/s during the turndown study are predictors of successful weaning49.\nMonitor laboratory parameters of end-organ perfusion such as lactate, SvO2, and renal function while patients are being weaned.\nTo facilitate the weaning process, place a simplified weaning bridge50 between the patient and the ECMO circuit prior to decannulation (this step is optional).\n\tNOTE: The weaning bridge allows patients to be observed off ECMO support and provides an opportunity to turn back on the ECMO circuit whenever required in a few minutes. It consists of a long tubing that connects inflow and outflow cannulae.\nPlace clamps on both inflow and outflow cannulae proximal to the weaning bridge, toward the patient side, thus separating the patient from the ECMO circuit and allowing blood to recirculate within the ECMO circuit.\nAfter clamping the circuit, observe the patients for up to 24 h prior to decannulation. In case hemodynamic support is required, re-initiate ECMO flow by simply removing the tubing clamps.\nTo further augment weaning, use a ventricular support device (e.g., Impella) which can provide up to 5 L/min of flow. Increase the flow from the ventricular support device and turn down VA-ECMO flow systematically while ensuring hemodynamic stability.",
    "NOTE: One of the benefits of the ventricular support device is that it can be implanted using an axillary approach, thus allowing for early ambulation after the removal of VA-ECMO51.\nOnce the patient is deemed a candidate for removal of VA-ECMO, perform decannulation in the operating room or cardiac catheterization laboratory.\n\tNOTE: Most patients with peripheral arterial cannulation will require some degree of vascular repair.\nSubscription Required.
