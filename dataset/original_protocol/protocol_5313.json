    "Software setup (Ethovision v 11.5.1026)Note: Instructions launch automatically when a new experiment is created. Here is a brief description of DMP dry maze experiment setup. In the ‘Arena Settings’ take a snapshot from the overhead camera. Make sure the arena is at the center of camera view, zoom in to maximize the size of the DMP dry maze platform in visible window on the computer screen (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170703/20170703020630_4154.jpgFigure 2. Arena, escape holes and calibration setup. The Arena is set to an area slightly bigger than the DMP dry maze platform. The platform diameter (122 cm) is used to calibrate the bit size of recorder videos. Escape holes were changed daily but kept the same for trials conducted on the same day.Use the ‘Draw Scale to Calibrate’ tool in ‘Arena Settings’ to draw a line (scale) to cover the diameter of platform. The scale size is set to 122 cm. Use the draw tools to draw an arena to cover the entire DMP dry maze platform. Draw a circle to cover the escape hole. Circle size can be adjusted by double-click and input the width and height manually. Circle size is set to 7.0 x 7.0 cm. Note: It is important to set the arena bigger than the platform. Setting the arena to exactly the size of platform results in loss of tracking if mouse moves along the edge.In the ‘Trial Control Settings’ define conditions for track start, stop and end (Figure 3). Automatic tracking should start 5 sec after the software detects a mouse. Trial ends after 90 sec of tracking or immediately after mouse enters the escape hole (defined as both the nose-point and center-point of a mouse are in the escape hole).",
    "Switch to the ‘Detection Settings’ page; connect the escape tube to the designated escape hole, put a control mouse of the same color and size as test subjects on the platform. Adjust contrast settings to ensure good tracking.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170703/20170703014454_3506.jpgFigure 3. Trial control and experimental timeline. A. Recording begins after the experimenter clicks Start before each planed trial. Track start condition is set to ‘cumulative duration over 5 sec when center-point is in arena’. Track will stop after one of the following conditions is met, a) Escaping, defined as mouse ‘center-point is in Escape Target Hole Day N’, b) Time limit, defined as ‘After a delay of 90 sec’. The recording ends immediately after tracking is ended. B. Schematic chart to demonstrate the experimental timeline.DMP taskPreparationOne week before the task mice are tail marked and briefly handled by the experimenter every day for 5 days (see Note 2). On each of the test days, mice are placed in the holding room (across the hallway) in their home cage kept in the dark (see Note 3) at least one hour prior to the first trial.Each mouse was habituated for 2 min in the escape tube before beginning the first trial on the first test day (see Note 2).Test Day 1Attach the escape tube to the designated escape hole. Put the mouse in the small transfer box and cover with a red paper towel. Bring it to the test room. Put the mouse on the platform at the center and keep it covered by the transfer box.After a delay of about 30 sec, start recording in the Ethovision software, turn on the tone noise (played at 85 dB, see Note 4) and immediately remove the transfer box to expose mouse in the environment.",
    "The experimenter then moves to the recording side of the room and monitors the tracking from computer screen (see Figure 3 for the trial control settings).Wait until the mouse completely enters the escape tube. Stop the tone noise and cover the escape hole with the 3” ABS plug (see Notes 5 and 6). After a 10 sec delay detach the tube, cover it with a red paper towel and put the mouse back to its home cage. Set the timer to count down from 10 min.Clean the escape tube and the platform with 70% ethanol and wipe with paper towels. Start the next trial when the timer counts down to zero.Note: To be more efficient we carried out the experiment in a paired way (Figure 3B). Test Days 2-4 (see Note 7)Change the escape hole to a new location (Figure 2) on each of the following test days. Repeat trials using the same procedures as Test Day 1.Note: Escape hole location is kept the same for all the mice on each day. A total of four different locations are used (see Figure 2)."
