    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAcute brain slice preparation\nTiming: ∼3 h\nOn the day of experiment, freshly prepare extracellular solution. Cool cutting solution and prepare set up for dissection. Take 300 mL of cutting ACSF solution and saturate with carbogen by bubbling for ∼30 min before cooling the solution to ice cold. After bubbling for ∼30 min, we cooled the solution rapidly by keeping it in −80°C for ∼ 20 min. Continuously bubble the solution with carbogen during dissection and slice preparation. This step involves anaesthetizing a rat or mouse for trans-cardial perfusion with ice-cold carbogenated cutting solution, extracting the brain, and obtaining oblique horizontal slices containing BLA using a vibratome. Slices are stored in normal extracellular solution in an in-house designed storage chamber at 37°C for ∼120 min and then at room temperature ∼ 24°C. In our experience, trans-cardial perfusion significantly improved viability of slices obtained from 3–12 weeks old adult mice and 3–8 weeks old rats. Typically, it takes ∼15–20 min from anesthetizing animal to obtaining slices.\nBefore starting slice preparation:\nEnsure all equipment necessary for trans-cardial preparation and dissection are ready and organized for quick access. Tools: 21 Gauge needle connected to short tubing (∼5 cm) and other end attached to a three-way stopcock, 2× 20 mL syringes, general dissection tools such as a small and large operating scissors, spatulas, forceps, single edged blade, beakers, petri-dishes, filter paper, a super glue tube that can dry quickly, inhouse-made 10° block or flat plate to glue the brain and the slicing chamber.\nClean a razor blade with 70% ethanol and rinse with deionized water thoroughly. Fit the blade to the blade holder in the vibratome.\nIncubation set up:",
    "Design a storage chamber using a 460 mL beaker, petri-dish- bottom replaced with a nylon mesh (we used commercially available stocking material) and Tygon tubing connected to carbogen source (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1350-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Top trace shows spontaneously occurring deflections in the field potential. Same LFP signal filtered for sharp-wave (1–20 Hz) and ripple (100–300 Hz, bottom) frequencies.

Top trace show LFP signal filtered for ripple frequency band that occur concurrently with inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSPs) in the PN and excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) with a burst of action potentials in the IN.\n(G) LFP and same pair of cells in voltage clamp showing ripple-associated inhibitory post-synaptic currents (IPSC) in the PN (Vh −50 mV; middle) and excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSC) in the IN going (Vh −70 mV, bottom). Data reported already in Perumal et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6].\nArrange the tube to form a C-shape and with pores along the upper curvature.\nMake pores using patch electrode pipettes. This chamber is filled with extracellular solution ∼250 mL and continuously bubbled with carbogen.\nNote: This arrangement for carbogen delivery facilitated extracellular solution to circulate continuously around the slices placed on the nylon mesh. Typically, slices are submerged ∼ 12 mm under the circulating extracellular solution.\nCritical: The storage chamber with solution should be pre-warmed to 37°C before slice preparation.\nAnimals: rats or mice.\nCritical: All animal experiments must comply with national and institutional ethics approval.\nPreparing oblique brain slices containing BLA.",
    "Before anesthetizing the animal, load two 20 mL syringes with ice-cold and carbogenated cutting solution, connect them to the stopcock for transcardial perfusion and set it ready for perfusion. Make a soft bed with tissue paper in a large square weighing boat. Place the weighing boat on a thick thermocool sheet.\nAnesthetize the animal using isoflurane sealed plexiglass container placed in a fume hood. Once the animal breathing has slowed down, pinch the paw for any pain response. If the animal is unresponsive, remove animal from the container. Insert the head inside a falcon tube containing cotton balls dabbed with isoflurane. Place animal on its back on the tissue bed in the weighing boat. Pin the front paw if required.\nLift the abdominal skin with forceps and use scissors to cut open the thorax. Cut the diaphragm carefully to expose the heart. Puncture the right atrium, then puncture the left ventricle with the 21G needle to perfuse ∼40 mL of ice-cold cutting solution. After perfusion, decapitate the mouse with large scissors. For rats, a rodent guillotine is used to decapitate. Place the head in a petri-dish with ice-cold cutting solution.\nOpen the skull using cuts on the left and front or through midline and front. Care must be taken not to damage the brain. Remove the brain using a small spatula into a small beaker or petri-dish filled with ice-cold cutting solution and bubble with carbogen.",
    "Oblique horizontal brain slice preparation. Place the ventral side of the brain on a filter paper moistened with cutting solution on a flat surface (petri dish or a glass plate). Using a single edge blade cut and remove the cerebellum. Lift the brain from the filter paper using a small filter paper or spatula. Gently dry the dorsal surface of the brain and glue it to the slicing block ∼10° (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) and quickly place it in a slicing chamber, fill with ice cold cutting solution and bubble with carbogen. Alternatively, to obtain the same angle, use a single edged blade to make a cut tangential to the dorsal cerebrum ∼10° and glue the cut surface to a flat plate. In both cases, the rostral end is in the downhill position (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).The BLA lies ∼500 μm and ∼700 μm from ventral surface in mouse and rat brain, respectively.\nThe first 2 slices from either side are typically discarded. Slices containing BLA as a triangular region (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C) can be identified by landmarks such as the external capsule on the lateral side and hippocampus in the caudal end. We cut 400 μm thick horizontal slices and usually 4 slices (2 from each side) contain the BLA. Transfer slices to the storage chamber filled with circulating pre-warmed external solution. Slices are incubated for ∼120 min at physiological temperature (∼37°C) and subsequently stored at room temperature (24°C–26°C).\nCritical: (1) Cutting solution should be saturated with carbogen and kept ice-cold throughout slice preparation. (2) Limiting the duration of slice preparation within 20 min helps to obtain good quality slices.",
    "Note: (1) In our experience, slices from 275 μm thickness showed SWs. However, we recommend 400 μm thick slices for stable local field potential recording. (2) We used either in-house made metal block or tangential cut on the dorsal side of cerebrum to obtain oblique slices and both methods reliably had network activity. Alternatively, make an agar block (see below for making 4% agarose solution) with desired angle to make oblique slices. (3) In our experience, circulation of carbogenated extracellular solution during incubation and storage is critical for the emergence of network activity. In our set-up, slices were kept submerged at ∼ 12 mm from the surface of ACSF. Limiting this volume can allow exchange of ACSF and better perfusion of slices. Alternatively, commercially available storage chambers such as Haas-type interface chambers provide continuous perfusion to slices and are used to record network activity in the hippocampus ex vivo (Maier et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). (4) We incubated slices at 37°C for the recovery of ion channels and pumps at physiological temperature. In our experience, incubation at this temperature reliably showed SWs. However, other studies have used ∼33°C (Maier et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) incubation in interface-type chambers for 2 h and observed SWs in hippocampus. (5) Large temperature changes from storage to recording chamber also can affect stability of network activity. We transferred one slice at a time after 2 h incubation at 37°C. Slices transferred within 1 hour (usually first 2 slices) after incubation at 33°C and subsequent slices at 28°C–30°C.\nElectrophysiology\nTiming: ∼4 h",
    "The main goal of the experiment is to obtain extracellular local field potential (LFP) recording in the BLA and simultaneously record from neuronal subtypes to elucidate their engagement with the network activity. After incubation, slices are transferred one at a time to the recording chamber perfused with pre-warmed and carbogenated extracellular solution and visualized under an upright microscope, either an (1) Olympus-BX50WI fitted with Infrared differential interference contrast, 40× water immersion objective and a fluorescent lamp (Olympus U RFLT, Olympus Optical) or (2) an Axio Examiner Z1 fitted with Dodt gradient contrast, 5× and water immersion objectives 40× (Zeiss, Germany) or 60× (Olympus) and a fluorescent lamp (X-cite 120Q, Excelitas) and a video camera either IR-1000 (Dagemti, USA), ProgRes (Jenoptik, Germany) or Retiga Electro (QImaging, Canada). Electrical signals were acquired with a Multiclamp 700A and 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, USA), digitized using ITC-16 A/D converter (InstruTECH, Germany), and recorded using Axograph X (Axograph Scientific, USA). Amplifier head stages were mounted on Patch-star manipulators (Scientifica, UK). The local field potential (LFP) generated by the network activity was recorded using a low-resistance extracellular patch electrode filled with 150 mM NaCl or external solution. The LFP signals from extracellular field electrodes are acquired with a Bessel filter set at 1 Hz–1 KHz and digitized at 50 kHz with x2000 amplification. For the LFP signal, the mains interference (50 Hz) was removed using Humbug (Digitimer, UK). For intracellular recordings, electrical signals are acquired from DC −10 kHz and digitized at 50 kHz. Start the electrophysiology set up at least 30 min prior to the start of the experiment.\nSetup and preparation before recording",
    "We used a submerged type recording chamber perfused with pre-warmed carbogenated external solution at 5–7 mL/min (33°C–34°C or 28°C–30°C). High perfusion rate is key for maintaining network activity in the recording chamber due to high metabolic demand. Keep the bath volume as low as possible to reduce pipette capacitance.\nTake an aliquot of intracellular recording solution and thaw under room temperature ∼30 min before recording. We routinely added biocytin (∼0.3%) to whole-cell patch clamp solution. Biocytin can be added while preparing internal solution. However, it is preferable to add fresh before start of experiment. After adding biocytin, sonicate for ∼5 min until solution is clear. Patch pipette fillers can be custom made from plastic pipette tips (200 μL, yellow) with gentle heat and stretching to form a thin tube. This pipette filler is then connected to a 0.22μm filter unit (pipette filler unit). Load intracellular solution in a 1 mL insulin injection syringe and connected to the pipette filter unit.\nMake a second pipette filler unit. Fill a 1mL insulin injection syringe with 150 mM NaCl or external perfusion solution and connect it to the filler unit.\nPull glass pipettes for extracellular and whole-cell patch recording electrodes. Borosilicate glass capillaries are pulled using a vertical puller (PC 10 dual stage puller, Narishige). Pull extracellular glass electrodes using Borosilicate glass capillaries and adjust heat settings to get tip resistance of 1–2 MΩ. Whole-cell patch clamp electrodes had tip resistance of 4–6 MΩ.\nTransfer one slice at a time to the recording chamber and secure it using a ‘U’ shaped harp with nylon strings. Visualize the slice under 5×. In oblique horizontal slices, the BLA can be distinguished as a triangular region demarcated medially and laterally by fiber bundles, and caudally by the lateral ventricle and hippocampus (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).",
    "Under 40× or 60× objective visualize the quality of slice. Adjust optics for visualizing somata coming above the surface. Healthy somata show a smooth surface and opaque (typically nucleus not visible). Healthy slices typically show many such cells (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C bottom) and critical for network activity.\nFill an extracellular glass electrode with 150 mM NaCl or external perfusion solution and mount the electrode to pipette holder. Apply a small positive pressure while lowering the electrode tip to the surface of the slice. Maintain positive pressure and gently lower the tip into the slice until the pipette tip is buried into the slice. Release the pressure and the tissue wraps around the pipette tip. In current clamp configuration (with settings for LFP), monitor field potential deflections. It takes ∼1–3 min tissue around the pipette tip to settle and stabilize field potential baseline. Monitor for deflections in LFP signal for a sharp upward or downward going epochs lasting ∼ 50 ms that occur at ∼30 events/min (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).",
    "Note: Keep the bath volume as low as possible to enhance perfusion of slice for network activity and reduce pipette capacitance for intracellular recordings. Alternatively, an interface like chamber or submerged chamber with dual perfusion setups can be used to maintain network activity (Maier et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). Since BLA has a non-laminar cellular organization, unlike the hippocampus, SW LFP signal amplitudes are small and can occur as upward or downward deflections. In our experience, placement of the extracellular electrode in lateral part of BLA yielded best results (as in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E), but reliable recordings can be obtained throughout BLA as SWs are generated by population burst activity. We suspected pipettes filled with external solution may develop microscopic precipitates over time (due to lack of carbogen) that may affect the recordings. As an alternative, we used 150 mM NaCl as LFP electrode filling solution. However, both methods yielded similar results within the recording duration. LFP signal to noise ratio can be improved by using 0.5–1 M NaCl as electrode filling solution in patch recording electrode. High molar salt solution reduces electrical resistance significantly, however, care should be taken as leakage of this solution into the tissue will affect the slice viability and cells in the vicinity of the electrode tip. It is ideal to place the extracellular electrode first before obtaining intracellular recordings. Usually, whole-cell patch clamp recordings were obtained from neurons >100 μm away from the LFP electrode.\nDual SW LFP and whole-cell patch clamp recording to identify cellular correlates of network activity: To obtain dual recordings, it is essential to check that electrophysiology rig, manipulators and head-stages are set up to minimize transfer of vibration.",
    "Under 40× or 60× magnification and DIC/Dodt contrast look for smooth healthy cells. Fill a pulled patch glass electrode with intracellular solution. Apply small positive pressure (∼20 mbar) and bring the tip close to soma. Press the tip gently on the soma and observe for a dimple. Release positive pressure and apply a gentle and subtle negative pressure or voltage (-70 mV) to help the seal, wait unit seal resistance exceeds at least one giga ohm, and release positive pressure to form tight seal (>1.5 GOhm seal). Apply a short pulse of gentle suction to break into whole cell configuration. Gently blow out membrane debris out of the pipette to improve access resistance of the whole-cell configuration. Switch to current clamp configuration and measure resting membrane potential (typically <-60 mV). If the resting membrane potential is more depolarized (>-50 mV), lose the recording and pick another cell. In slices obtained from transgenic mice lines, interneurons can be visualized using fluorescent light excitation. Keep fluorescent light exposure minimal to reduce photo-toxicity and bleaching. Identify a fluorescent soma and switch to DIC/Dodt mode to visualize. Verify if the somatic membrane is healthy looking and use same steps as above to obtain whole-cell patch recording. The same steps can also be followed to obtain simultaneous recordings from two neurons along with LFP. PNs and INs can be distinguished by their intrinsic electrophysiological properties (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D). Using a small step current injection (first step -50 pA, increment by 30 pA, 600 ms). PNs discharge at much lower frequency with wider action potentials than INs (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D). For more details, please refer to Perumal et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6].",
    "SW associated intra-cellular correlates: Upon conversion to whole-cell configuration monitor online for spontaneously occurring epochs of large post-synaptic potentials (PSP, current clamp) or post-synaptic currents (PSC, voltage clamp). SW- correlated events occur time-locked with every LFP deflection and are large multi-synaptic inputs as compared to mono-synaptic inputs to the same cells and can be detected online. Secondly, PNs and INs receive distinctive SW associated inputs.\nSW associated PSPs: Switch to current clamp configuration and record spontaneous SW associated PSPs for at least 3 min. In PNs, SW-PSPs occur as depolarizing potentials from rest (∼-70 mV) but reverse polarity at ∼ −60 mV, hyperpolarizing the cell. In current clamp, inject positive current to depolarize membrane potential to ∼-50 mV and record spontaneous SWi-PSPs which occur as long-lasting hyperpolarizing PSPs (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F). Record reversal polarity of SW-PSPs by setting membrane potential from −80 mV to −50 mV (see Figure 1E in Perumal et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nUsing fluorescence guidance, obtain whole cell recording in an IN. In INs, SW-PSPs occur as excitatory potentials triggering a burst of action potentials.\nSW-PSPs in PNs and INs occur simultaneously with SW-LFP. Obtain dual recording using the same steps as above and monitor for spontaneously occurring SW-PSPs. SW-PSPs occur simultaneously (±30 ms) between neurons within BLA.",
    "SW associated PSCs: Switch to voltage clamp configuration to record SW-PSCs. In PNs, set holding potential to −70 mV and monitor for SW-PSCs which occur as large inward currents time-locked with LFP deflections. Change the holding potential to −50 mV and monitor for SW-PSCs. Notice SW-PSCs occur as outward currents (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G). Set holding potential from −80 mV to −50 mV to record reversal of SW-PSCs. Due to GABAergic origin of SW inputs to PNs, SW-PSP/PSCs reverse polarity near −60 mV, near Cl- reversal for whole-cell recording solution (see Figure S1H in Perumal et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). In interneurons, set holding potential to −70 mV and monitor epochs of large inward currents. It is noteworthy that SW-PSCs in PNs and INs display consistent waveform between episodes, cells and slices. For detailed description of SW-PSC waveform please refer to (Perumal et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nSWs and associated intracellular events show dual pharmacological sensitivity to antagonists for GABAA and AMPA receptors. Perfuse antagonists for GABAA and AMPA receptors sequentially to verify dual sensitivity (see Figure 1K in Perumal et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). We used following GABAA receptor antagonists: Bicuculline (10 μM), Gabazine (3 μM), and Picrotoxin (100 μM) and AMPA receptor antagonists: 2,3-Dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo [f] quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (NBQX, 10 μM) and 6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX, 10 μM).\nNote: (1) SW associated intracellular events (SWi) have consistent waveform and synaptic properties in BLA neurons (Perumal et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). In addition to LFP, SW-PSPs and PSCs are a reliable proxy to detect network activity in the slice.",
    "Targeted recording from INs initiating SWs in the BLA: In the BLA, SWs and associated synaptic events can be initiated by a rare subset parvalbumin (PV) expressing GABAergic neurons, chandelier interneurons, that make synaptic contacts at the axon initial segment (AIS) of postsynaptic PNs. Individual BLA chandelier INs contact ∼200 PNs forming characteristic cartridge synapses at the AIS, the site of action potential initiation. To our knowledge, molecular markers exclusively targeting chandelier INs are unavailable for BLA. Even among PV INs, chandelier INs make a small proportion of (<10 %). Further, similar to basket PV INs (90% of PV INs) chandelier INs display fast spike discharge with depolarizing current injections. Thus, obtaining targeted recording from chandelier INs remains a challenge. Our group and others have reported that chandelier INs evoke a characteristic time-locked feedback excitation(Molnar et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Perumal et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Spampanato et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Szabadics et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Taniguchi et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; Woodruff et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). This evoked feedback excitation occurs exclusively in chandelier INs and suggests this feeback excitation as an electrophysiological marker(Woodruff and Yuste, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). Using a combination of somato-dendritic features and evoked feedback excitation enhanced our success rate to encounter chandelier INs. In the BLA, we predominantly encountered these cells in the lateral and caudal BLA (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1350-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Scale bar:10 μm.\n(B) Traces show four types of intrinsic action potential discharge patterns elicited by depolarizing suprathreshold current injection in INs with feedback excitation.",

Data reported in Perumal et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6].\nUnder a 40× objective, visualize INs using fluorescence guidance. Adjust exposure and gain settings on the video acquisition software to visualize somata and proximal dendrites. Look for somata with square or triangular shape that also have a thick bifurcating dendrite at one corner (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nOnce a suitable IN soma is identified, switch to DIC/Dodt contrast mode and verify health of the neuron to obtain whole-cell patch clamp recording.\nObtain whole-cell recording using step 6a and monitor for spontaneous SW associated synaptic PSPs in current clamp.",
    "In current clamp, inject depolarizing current steps to elicit intrinsic discharge properties. Ins fire narrower action potentials than PNs and also discharge at high frequency with distinctive firing patterns (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) (Woodruff and Sah, 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]; Perumal et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). In our experience, Ins with feedback excitation showed 4 types of fast spiking discharge patterns characteristic of PV subset of Ins (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nMonitoring for evoked feedback excitation: In current clamp, use square current pulse 1–2.5 nA for 0.5–1 ms to evoke a single action potential. Monitor for a EPSP or EPSP burst immediately after the action potential. Run this protocol for 30 or more trials (preferably 100 trials). Presence of feedback excitation can be detected online by occurrence of an EPSP immediately after the action potential (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D). This evoked feedback EPSP occurs time-locked at ∼ 2–4 ms, with at high success rate (∼ 83%). The latency of the feedback EPSP indicates it originated from a di-synaptic circuit. Notice that same cells can also evoke multi-synaptic burst of SW associated EPSPs (40±26% trials) which typically triggers time-locked action potentials riding on time-locked EPSPs (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nMonitoring for feedback excitation in voltage clamp: Switch to voltage clamp and set holding potential to −70 mV. Apply a square pulse of +70 mV for 0.5 ms. This pulse evokes a single unclamped ‘action current’. Monitor online for an inward current immediately following ‘action potential’ current (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E). Like in current clamp, this presence of di-synaptic feedback can be detected online as it occurs time-locked at ∼2–4 ms following voltage step. Notably, a single discharge in these cells is sufficient to trigger successive waves of SW-EPSCs at regular intervals of ∼ 4 ms and they consistently summate within ∼20 ms.",
    "Chandelier Ins evoked feedback excitation shows dual pharmacological sensitivity to GABAA and AMPA receptor antagonists (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E). Bath apply antagonists for AMPA and GABAA receptors sequentially to verify dual sensitivity.\nAfter recording, slices are transferred to fixative for the recovery of morphology and verification of axo-axonic synaptic contacts.\nNote: (1) In the BLA, chandelier Ins are frequently encountered at the lateral and ventral regions and typically show fast-spiking characteristics of PV-Ins. (2) Soma and dendritic morphological features described here is only a guidance. In our experience, these criteria enhanced recording neurons with feedback excitation in 1 out of 4 cells. (3) IN discharge evoked SW-burst involves multi-synaptic recruitment of other neurons, thus depends on intact connections in the slice. We encountered 19/102 cells with di-synaptic feedback excitation that also evoked SW burst.\nImmunohistochemistry\nPrepare solutions for immunolabeling\nPrepare fixative: 200 mL of 4% Paraformaldehyde in 1× Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS), pH ∼7.4, store at 4°C and use within 5 days.\nBlocking solution: 0.5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and 0.05% Saponin in 1× PBS. Blocking solution can be prepared as 20× stock, stored in 1mL aliquots in −30°C and used in ∼8 weeks.\nSodium azide stock: Make 10% sodium azide stock solution in dH2O. To prevent microbial growth, add sodium azide (0.05%) to blocking solution.\n4% Agarose in H2O is used to embed slices and sub-sectioned to label for synaptic contacts.",
    "After whole-cell patch recording, neurons can be recovered for morphology by immunolabeling for biocytin. Interneurons in the BLA have a dense axonal plexus. For morphological recovery, it is best to limit number of sampled Ins to one or two to avoid overalap of axonal arbors. Solutions for immunolabeling are prepared prior to preparing for electrophysiology. A detailed immunolabeling protocol is beyond the scope of the article. For more details, please refer to https://theolb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html[href=https://theolb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html].\nAfter whole-cell patch recording (typically lasts at least ∼30 min) transfer the slice to a 16 well plate filled with fixative and incubate for ∼1 h at room temperature inside a hood for rapid fixation.\nAt the end of experiments, transfer slices in the fixative for overnight (∼12 h) incubation at 4°C.\nFollowing day, slices are resuspended in PBS and rinsed for 3 × 15 min.\nResuspend the slices in blocking buffer and incubated on a shaker for 1 h at room temperature.\nRecovery for biocytin.

For detailed morphological characterization, we imaged neurons with a spinning-disk confocal system (Marianas; 3I, Inc.) consisting of a Axio Observer Z1 (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a CSU-W1 spinning-disk head (Yokogawa Corporation of America), ORCA-Flash4.0 v2 CMOS camera (Hamamatsu Photonics), 20× 0.8 NA PlanApo and 40× 1.2 NA C-Apo objectives. Image acquisition was performed using SlideBook 6.0 (3I, Inc). Morphological reconstruction was carried out manually using Neurolucida-360 (MBF Bioscience) and visualized in NeuroExplorer (MBF Bioscience).\nAfter imaging, embed slices in 4% agarose for sub-sectioning. For this step, prepare other tools such as a dedicated vibratome for immunohistochemistry, single edged blade, a paint brush, glass petri-dish etc. For more details, please refer to https://theolb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html[href=https://theolb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html].\nUsing a large petri-dish that can fit the length of the glass and fill with 1× PBS.\nPlace glass slides with slices in the petri-dish. Using a single edged blade cut through the sealed sides of the cover slip.\nUsing a paint brush gently move the cover slip and allow the slice to be completely dislodged from the slide.\nTransfer the slice into a 16-well plate filled with 1× PBS.\nGently warm 4% agarose in a microwave for ∼2–3 min and stir to ensure solution is clear without precipitates. If overheated, the solution turns yellow and may not embed slices well. In this case, discard and make a new batch.\nTransfer a slice on to a glass slide or small glass petri-dish. Gently remove excess PBS as much as possible using a filter paper without touching the slice. This is critical for proper embedding.\nAs quickly as possible transfer a large drop of agarose solution (∼40°C) on the slice and wait for agar to solidify at room temperature (∼25°C).\nOnce solidified, trim the excess agar.",
    "Transfer embedded slice block to a dedicated vibratome (VT1000S vibratome, Leica) exclusively for immunohistochemistry and cut to 70 microns thick slabs submerged in 1× PBS.\nSuspend sub-sectioned slices in the blocking buffer as described above.\nAdd primary antibodies labeling for parvalbumin (mouse anti-parvalbumin, 1:2000, Sigma-Aldrich) and Ankyrin-G (rabbit anti-Ankyrin G, 1:500, Santa Cruz) and incubate at room temperature for two days.\nAfter two days, gently remove blocking buffer and wash slices with 1× PBS, 3 times for 15 min each.\nRemove PBS and add blocking buffer containing secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorophores: goat anti-mouse, Alexa 405 (1:1000, Life Technologies) and goat anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 647(1:1000, Invitrogen).\nIncubate for 1 day at room temperature.\nOn the following day, remove blocking buffer and wash slices 3× with 1× PBS, for 15 min.\nMount slices on glass slides with DABCO. We imaged synaptic contacts with 63× and 100× oil immersion objectives and imaged with spinning-disk set-up described above."
