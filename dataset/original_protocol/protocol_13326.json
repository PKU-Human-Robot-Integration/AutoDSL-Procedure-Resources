    "This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University. The patients signed informed consent, consented to be filmed, and allowed the investigators to use their surgical data.\n1. Patient selection\nSelect patients based on the following inclusion criteria.\n\t\nSelect patients for whom conservative treatment time was longer than 3 months and to which the patients responded poorly.\nSelect patients whose symptoms and signs were consistent with the imaging findings.\nSelect patients whose magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine shows a width greater than 1 cm between the psoas muscle and the anterior border of the vertebral artery.\nSelect patients with no significant variants on abdominal vascular examination.\nApply the following exclusion criteria.\n\t\nExclude patients with spinal canal infection and tumor complications.\nExclude patients with spinal stenosis due to severe facet joint hyperplasia and prolapse of the nucleus pulposus.\nExclude patients with severe lumbar spondylolisthesis greater than grade III.\nExclude patients with a history of abdominal surgery.\n2. Preoperative preparation\nInstruct the patient to undergo lumbar computed tomography (CT), lumbar MRI, and lumbar X-ray examination. Perform cardiovascular and cerebrovascular, and abdominal vascular examinations to identify and better manage risk factors to ensure safety of the operation17,18.\nAdvise the patient on skin preparation of the surgical site preoperatively, with a fasting requirement of 12 h before the surgery.\nOn the day of the operation, after the administration of general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation, place the patient on the operating table in a right-sided lateral decubitus position.\nInsert a cushion beneath the right abdomen, which is slightly tilted backward depending on the target intervertebral disc, in order to obtain adequate access to the physiologic OLIF corridor between the psoas muscle and the vena cava anteriorly.",
    "Choose the left abdomen of the patient as the surgical area.\nEnsure that the patient remains in the correct position for the surgery. Secure the patient with tape and confirm the operation stage.\n3. Starting the operation\nPlace a square locator on the left abdomen of the patient. Ensure the upper and lower edges of the locator correspond to the upper and lower vertebral bodies of the diseased intervertebral disc, and the anterior and posterior edges correspond to the anterior and posterior edges of the diseased intervertebral disc.\nConfirm the projection of the target segment on the patient's skin with X-ray fluoroscopy. Mark the surgical site (Figure 1).\nAfter identifying the surgical site, disinfect the incision area, lay sheets, and prepare surgical instruments.\nMake a 4-5 cm skin incision parallel to the external oblique muscle fibers. Separate the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle, the transverse abdominis, and the transverse abdominal fascia bluntly with fingers (Figure 2).\nUse long-handled forceps to clamp the peanut-like gauze mass to expose the surgical intervertebral space between the abdominal vascular sheath and the psoas major muscle.\nAfter completing exposure of the target intervertebral space, insert Kirschner wire and perform intraoperative X-ray examinations to confirm that the exposed segment is the surgical segment (Figure 3A).\nAfter completing identification of the intervertebral space, insert the dilation tubes successively for expansion. Confirm the position of the expansion channel by intraoperative X-ray (Figure 3B).\nAttach the retractor to the operating table using the universal arm and operating table clips. Ensure that the channel does not move during the surgery, and then place the working light.\nUse a long-handled sharp knife to remove the annulus fibrosus, and long-handled nucleus pulposus forceps to remove the diseased disc tissue (Figure 3C).",
    "Clean the intervertebral space with a scraper and curette to clear the residual disc tissue in the surgical segment.\nAfter cleaning the intervertebral space, use a spreader to open a collapsed intervertebral space.\nUse a bone rasp to remove the cartilage layer on the surface of the endplate until the bony surface bleeds.\nPlace an appropriately sized intervertebral exploration device into the disc. Perform intraoperative X-ray fluoroscopies to determine the appropriate fusion device size (Figure 3D,E).\nAfter determining the appropriate device size, add allogeneic bone to the interbody cage of the same size and implant the cage under X-ray fluoroscopy (Figure 3F,G).\nAfter placing the interbody cage, suture the wound layer by layer. Use No. 10, No. 4, and No. 1 thread to suture the muscle, fascia, and surgical incision, respectively (Figure 3H). Compress the surgical incision with gauze.\nPrescribe an anti-inflammatory (cefazolin) once a day for 3 days to prevent infection after the patient returns to the ward. Use antithrombotic drugs (low-molecular weight heparin sodium) to prevent deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs on the 2nd postoperative day, once a day for 3 days.\n4. Postoperative care\nInstruct the patient to rest in bed. Perform deep vein color Doppler on the third postoperative day.\nInstruct the patient to walk on the ground with the assistance of a lumbar brace, usually within 3 days post-operation if the deep vein color Doppler shows no deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremities.\nChange the antithrombotic medication to twice daily if an intramuscular vein thrombosis is present on a deep vein ultrasound of the lower extremities.\nContact Vascular Surgery for treatment if the deep vein ultrasound of the lower extremities shows a deep vein thrombosis. Perform the lower-extremity rehabilitation exercise as reported previously19,20.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
