    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAll incubations are carried out at 22°C to 25°C unless otherwise stated.\nAging flies\nTiming: 1 to 60 days\nCollect female and/or male flies from fly cross in beginning step 2g (Generating Drosophila stocks), which express mito-GFP, mCherry-Atg8a and the desired GAL4 driver.\nMaintain in standard food vials, transferring to new food vials two times per week until flies reach desired age. Discard old vials.\nPause Point: 3 to 4 days\nDrosophila brain dissection and fixation\nTiming: 20 min per brain\nAnesthetize aged experimental flies on a CO2 pad a few at a time to avoid excessive anesthesia. Using dissecting forceps, pick up an anesthetized fly and place it on a dissecting plate near a droplet of 0.3% PBT.\nQuickly decapitate the fly with forceps and place the head into the droplet. Dissect the brain under a dissecting microscope by removing eye discs and cuticle.\nNote: A useful instructional video can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4rVa7JCzdg&t=1s[href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4rVa7JCzdg&t=1s].\nPlace brains in a glass spot plate well that contains 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min.\nUsing forceps, transfer the brain from fixing solution to another well containing 0.3% PBT. Up to five brains of the same genotype can be transferred to a single well.\nWhen all brains have been placed in 0.3% PBT, place the glass well plate on an orbital shaker on the lowest setting for 5 min. Repeat this washing step four times by using a fine tip transfer pipette to discard used solution and add fresh 0.3% PBT to wells.\nNote: When adding new solution into a well, ensure the brains are in solution before the plate to the shaker. Brains that stick to the glass above liquid level will become dry and unusable.",
    "Optional: Immunostaining Drosophila brain (This step can be eliminated if using a GAL4 enhancer that allows easier mito-GFP and mCherry-Atg8a visualization.)\nTiming: 2 days\nUnder the dissecting microscope, use a fine tip transfer pipette to remove 0.3% PBT from each well and add 500 μL blocking solution to brain-containing wells. Keep the glass spot plate on the orbital shaker for at least 30 min.\nPrepare a fresh primary antibody solution (We use 1:100 anti-tyrosine hydroxylase primary antibody to blocking solution). Place 10 μL of the primary antibody solution to each microtiter well.\nRemove the glass spot plate from shaker and use forceps to transfer brains from the glass wells to antibody-containing microtiter wells. Each well can hold up to 5 brains.\nPlace the microtiter plate in an empty pipette box with a moist towel on the bottom to keep brains from drying and keep the box at 4°C overnight.\nPause Point: 1 day\nUsing forceps, transfer the brains from the microtiter plate to a glass well containing 0.3% PBT. Using a fine tip transfer pipette to change solutions, wash the brains in 0.3% PBT four times for 5 min on the orbital shaker.\nRemove 0.3% PBT and add 500 μL of blocking solution. Place on shaker for at least 30 min.\nWhile the brains are in the blocking phase, prepare a 1:200 solution of Alexa Fluor® 405-conjugated secondary antibody to blocking solution.\nNote: Limit light exposure to light-sensitive secondary antibody solution.\nRemove blocking solution and add 400 μL of secondary antibody solution to each well. Protect from light and place on orbital shaker for 2 h.\nPause Point: 1 day\nReplace secondary antibody solution with 0.3% PBT and incubate for five minutes on shaker. Repeat washing procedure four times.\nMounting Drosophila brains on microscope slides\nTiming: 30 min",
    "Label a microscope slide with genotype, antibody label, fly age, treatment, and date.\nPlace a small drop of 70% glycerol onto the slide near the frosted left side. Drag the glycerol droplet to the right along the slide with the transfer pipette. The thin glycerol line will stabilize the brains.\nUse forceps to remove one brain at a time from the final wash and place it in the left region of the glycerol line.\nNote: Dab the forceps on a Kim Wipe® to minimize the transfer of washing solution to the slide.\nCarefully drag the brain to the right, maintaining orientation for ease of imaging. Align brains in the glycerol line.\nRemove excess glycerol from the slide using a Kim Wipe®. This is easiest to do under the dissecting microscope. Re-orient displaced brains.\nPlace a small horizontal line of Prolong Antifade® above the line of brains. Carefully place a coverslip over the top of the mounted brains. Allow the mounting media to spread for 1 to 2 min, avoiding light exposure.\nSeal the coverslip to the slide with clear nail polish.\nUsing a marker, draw a line indicating the location of the brains so they can be easily located during imaging.\nPlace slide in a slide box and store at −20°C.\nPause Point: up to 5 days\nCapturing z-stacks of mito-GFP and mCherry-Atg8a\nTiming: 10 min per brain\nTurn on computer, confocal microscope and open LASX application. The following steps are executed in the “Acquisition” panel of the LASX application unless otherwise indicated.\nTurn on the 488 nm and 532 nm excitation lasers.\nOptional: Turn on the ∗405 nm excitation laser if capturing z-stacks for Alexa Fluor 405.\nOpen 3 sequences and set the conditions as listed below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_544_9.csv\nSet pinhole to 1 AU.",
    "Set the image resolution to 512 × 512 pixels and speed to 600 Hz for fast scanning while locating volume of interest (VOI) boundaries.\nUsing the 63× oil objective, locate the brain and the region of interest (ROI) on the confocal microscope. Use the setting for Sequence 3 if the brains have been immunostained, as excitation laser exposure can cause photobleaching. If not using immunostaining, locate the ROI as rapidly as possible using the fluorescence of GFP or of mCherry.\nNote: ROI selection will vary depending on the brain region or cell type of interest. A large ROI may require acquisition of multiple z-stacks and/or development of a standardized selection sampling process.\nNote: A small amount of photobleaching may occur while locating the ROI. Since the Alexa Fluor 405 is not being measured, it is best to expose this fluorophore to excitation while locating the ROI.\nIf using antibody labeling, use the antibody signal to define z-plane VOI boundaries. Use the mCherry signal in the absence of antibody staining, as the GFP signal fades rapidly with excitation.\nClick the “Live” button in the LASX application and manually manipulate the z position around your VOI. At the top of the VOI, click the “Begin” button. Move the stage to the bottom of the VOI and click the “End” button.\nNote: VOI boundary in the z-plane will vary depending on the brain region or cell type of interest. A large VOI will increase acquisition time and file size and may increase protocol time unnecessarily. Researchers may choose to capture multiple z-stacks or develop a standardized selection sampling process.\nChange the pixels per image and image capture speed to 1024 × 1024 and 400 Hz, respectively, to capture a higher-resolution z-stack.",
    "Set the z-stack step to 340 nm. The z-slice thickness should remain constant for all samples; the number of slices per sample will vary with the VOI.\nSelect “Between Lines” under the “Sequential Scan” tab so that each z slice is excited by all lasers (sequences) before the confocal moves to the next slice. This pattern continues until all z slices in the VOI have been captured.\nClick “Start” to take image – this can take several minutes depending on the size of the VOI in the z plane.\nSave the image in “lif” format with a descriptive title.\nPause Point: indefinite\nDetecting 3D colocalization of mCherry-Atg8a and mito-GFP\nTiming: 10 min per brain\nOpen Image-Pro Premier 3D Application and open lif files.\nUnder 3D View tab, click the “Reload” button to open the “Load Image” window. The voxel sizes should read: X = 0.114, Y = 0.114, Z = 0.340 (μm). These settings are determined by image capture settings and should be constant among all samples.\nIn the same window, uncheck “Auto” and click “Reset” to change all values to 1.\nUnder the “3D View” tab, click the “Show VOI” and “Show VOI handles” icons to allow adjustment of volume of interest (VOI). Using the arrow tool from the “3D View” panel, grab the green square handles on the corners of the image to adjust the VOI.\nUnder 3D Measure tab, click types.\nAdd “volume:volume,” and set minimum volume to 0.01 and maximum volume to 1.5 μm.\nClick “Ranges” button to “On.”\nClick the “Add Iso-Surface” icon in the right panel.\nSelect channel 2 (532 nm, sequence 2 during image capture) from the drop-down menu.\nUncheck “Auto” and click “Reset” to change all values to 1.\nSelect “Lo-Pass 3×3×3” from “Filter” the drop-down menu.",
    "Select “Auto Bright” from the “Threshold type” drop-down menu.\nUnder “Volume Surface Channel 2,” Click the “Count” button to select puncta that fit volume and threshold criteria. An “isosurface” will appear on selected voxels.\nAdjust minimum “Volume Surface Channel 2” intensity range to collect visible puncta.\nClick data table under 3D Measure tab.\nOptional: If collecting data in immunolabled cells, manually remove puncta outside of labeled regions: in the “3D View” tab, select the arrow tool and click on each unwanted object and press “delete.”\nUnder the “3D Measure” tab, click “Data Table,” then click on Microsoft Excel icon to export the data to an Excel spreadsheet.\nClick on the disk icon to save this isosurface file, which represents the autophagosomes. Delete channel 2 isosurface from the viewing window.\nNote: If it is not deleted, these data will be exported on additional export attempts.\nIf visible puncta fall out of detection range, repeat steps 46 to 51, adjusting minimum “Volume Surface Channel” range in step 48 to collect visible puncta. Manually remove puncta that have already been exported to Excel.\nClick “Types” on 3D Measure tab and add, “Coloc Pearson.”\nClick on “Add 3D Colocalization” isosurface. From the drop-down menu, select the “channel red, channel green” option to determine how much green mito-GFP signal is in red puncta.\nClick “Reset,” and enter “1” for each pixel dimension.\nSelect “Lo-Pass 3×3×3” filter, “Auto Bright”, “Threshold Type” and check box for close edges. Uncheck execute count.\nSet the threshold for the red channel using same minimum threshold for red isosurface in step 48 for each saved isosurface.",
    "Click folder icon (next to disk icon used to save red puncta) under colocalization and open the saved isosurface file. (Note: on previous versions of Image Pro Premier 3D, data occasionally are all “0.” If this occurs, re-open to apply saved isosurface). Data are automatically added to the data table.\nClick on data table and manually remove identified objects that have Pearson’s correlation coefficients that are less than or equal to zero.\nExport to Excel.\nRepeat steps 54 to 60 for each saved isosurface.\nCount the number of colocalization measurements."
