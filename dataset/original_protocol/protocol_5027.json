    "Notes: While the use of HeLa cells is described, any cell type can be used, provided the cells remain attached to the plate after several cold PBS washes. If other cell types are used, a proper genomic DNA control will be needed for the qPCR step. Additionally, if non-human cells are used, a set of mLamin primers (or other genomic control) will need to be designed, tested, and used for the qPCR step.While virus packaging the fLuc transgene is described, any transgene can be used, provided transgene-specific qPCR primers are designed, tested, and used.Since the binding and internalization assays are separate, the number of wells used must be doubled. Half of the wells will be used for the binding assay, and the other half of the wells will be used for the internalization assay. Cell preparation for virus binding and internalization assaySeed 12-well TC plate with 1e5 HeLa cells/well (Figure 1), bringing the well to a final volume of 1 ml. Allow 4-6 h for the cells to fully adhere to the plate at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a tissue culture incubator.Note: If the cells are to be treated with small molecules, treat cells with the compound and vehicle control prior to 4 °C incubation. The amount of incubation time necessary for any small molecule will need to be determined prior to performing this assay.Incubate cells at 4 °C for 30 min.Infect cells with AAV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1e3 vector genomes per cell (vg/cell) by carefully pipetting virus into the meniscus of the media near the edge of the well, taking care not to scrape the well surface. Slowly rock the plate by hand several times to mix.",
    "Notes:  If the stock concentration of AAV is highly concentrated, the virus can be diluted in DMEM prior to infection. MOI can be altered to suit individual needs.Incubate cells at 4 °C for 1 h to allow virus to bind to the cell surface.Wash cells gently 3 times with 400 µl ice-cold PBS to remove unbound virus by tilting the plate towards you and adding PBS very slowly to the edge of the well with a pipette.Note: For each sample, one well will be used for binding, and the other well will be used for internalization.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170117/20170117182042_6737.jpgFigure 1. Example of experimental plate setup. Example of the plate setup for a binding and internalization experiment. The Trypsin Negative plate is a negative control that is trypsinized immediately after binding is performed.Binding (1 well)Add 200 µl PBS to each well.Scrape off the cells and transfer them to a 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tube.Isolate total DNA using a QIAGEN DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit, following manufacturer instructions with the following exception: use 50 µl of molecular grade water to elute sample from the column.Note: To increase DNA yield, the water can be heated to 37 °C prior to elution, and the water can be allowed to sit on the membrane for up to 5 min.Internalization (1 well)Carefully add 1 ml fresh complete DMEM, pre-warmed to 37 °C, to the cells by tilting the plate towards you and adding very slowly to the edge of the well with a pipette.Incubate at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a tissue culture incubator for 1 h to allow for virus internalization.Note: The amount of time to allow internalization can be varied, or several time points can be assayed to generate an internalization curve.",
    "Remove the media by aspiration and treat the cells with 1 ml trypsin to detach them from the plate and to remove surface bound virions that did not internalize.Transfer the trypsinized cells to a 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tube and pellet cells by centrifuging at 500 x g for 3-5 min at room temperature.Carefully remove trypsin without disturbing the cell pellet.Wash the cell pellet 3 times by resuspending the cells in 200 µl PBS, pelleting by centrifugation 500 x g for 3-5 min, and carefully removing the PBS.After the final PBS wash, resuspend the cell pellet in 200 µl PBS.Isolate total DNA using a QIAGEN DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit, following manufacturer instructions with the following exception: use 50 µl of molecular grade water to elute sample from the column.qPCR quantificationfLuc transgene (or transgene of choice):Generate standard curve for vector genome quantitation using plasmid containing the CBA-fLuc transgene.Dilute a 10 ng/µl plasmid stock 1:200 in molecular grade water to generate a plasmid solution of 5 x 104 fg/µl.Perform 7 further serial dilutions of 1:5 in molecular grade water to generate the remainder of the standard curve, with the remaining points of the standard curve having the following concentrations: 1 x 104 fg/µl, 2 x 103 fg/µl, 4 x 102 fg/µl, 8 x 101 fg/µl, 1.6 x 101 fg/µl, 3.2 x 100 fg/µl, and 6.4 x 10-1 fg/µl.Note: If there is space on the qPCR plate, 2 standard curves should be used to make quantitation more accurate. In addition, this would allow exclusion of abhorrent points within the standard curve.Prepare master mix (Table 1) for n + 1 reactions (with n being the total number of reactions).Table 1. qPCR master miximgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170117/20170117183129_1076.",
    "jpgNote: To prepare a working stock of F + R primers, mix F primer (20 µM concentration) with R primer (20 µM concentration) in a 1:1 ratio. The resulting primer mixture will have both F and R primers at a concentration of 10 µM each.Load 8 µl master mix in each well.Load 2 µl of each sample, including standard curve.Note: Adding the sample directly to the side of the well assures complete loading of the sample.Spin the plate in a microplate centrifuge for 30-60 sec at room temperature to assure samples are at the bottom of the wells.Note: The VWR microplate centrifuge used has a maximum speed of 500 x g.
