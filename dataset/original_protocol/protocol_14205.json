    "This study was approved by the Ethics Research Committee of the University of Murcia. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.\n1. Perineum Measurements\nNOTE: Before taking the measurements, two observers have to be trained to minimize inter-observer variability.\nPatient Preparation\nPlace the patient in a lithotomy position, with thighs at an angle of 45° to the examination table.\nUse a digital caliper with a resolution length of 0.000500 inches (Figure 2A).\nTo begin measuring, close the device and check that \"0\" appears on the display and press the calibration button.\nSelect millimeters as the unit of measurement.\n\t\tNOTE: Other measurement units, such as inches, may be selected.\nAGD Measurements\nPerform the two AGD measurements in each woman using the digital caliper.\nMeasure AGDAC from the anterior clitoral surface to the upper verge of the anus (Figure 1, point 1 to point 3).\nMeasure AGDAF from the posterior fourchette or posterior margin of the hymen to the upper verge of the anus (Figure 1, point 2 to point 3).\nTo improve accuracy, have two examiners perform each of these measurements three times, taking a total of six measures for AGDAF and AGDAC, respectively.\nUse the averaged values of the six measurements as the true estimate of the AGD in subsequent analyses.\nBlind each examiner to the other examiner´s results.\n\t\tNOTE: The caliper does not need to be sterilized after each use, but has to be cleaned up with soap and water and disinfectant, such as 2% alcoholic chlorhexidine solution.\nPOP-Q Measurements\nTake GH and PB measurements according to the parameters of the POP-Q classification20,21, using a centimeter ruler or tape (Figure 2). Use a kit containing a centimeter ruler and a skin marker in this report (Figure 2B). Measurements of the GH and PB are shown in Figure 1.",
    "Measure GH from the middle of the external urethral meatus to the posterior margin of the hymen (Figure 1).\nMeasure PB from the posterior margin of the hymen to the mid-anal opening.\n\t\tNOTE: Bump et al.20 recommend expressing all measurements in centimeters. Measurements may be taken to the nearest 0.5 cm, and the authors consider that further precision is unlikely. All reports should clearly specify how measurements were taken and the accuracy of the instrument used as no specific instruments are recommended in the POP-Q system.\nHave two examiners collect each measurement 3 times. Take the average of the six measurements as the true value.\nBlind each examiner to the other examiner´s results.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
