    "1. Nematode growth medium (NGM) plate preparation\nAdd 2.5 g of peptone and 3 g of NaCl to 970 mL of deionized water contained in a 2 L Erlenmeyer flask. Stir contents using a magnetic stir bar. Thereafter, add 20 g of agar to the flask. Autoclave the contents of the flask at 121 °C and a pressure of 15 lb/in2 for 30 min. After sterilization, place the flask on a stir plate and allow the medium to cool until the temperature reaches 50 °C.\nTo prepare the NGM plates add the following reagents to the cooled medium: 25 mL of 1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH = 6.0), 1 mL of 1 M MgSO4, 1 mL of 1 M CaCl2, 1 mL of (5 mg/mL in 95% ethanol) cholesterol, 1 mL of (10% v/w in ethanol) nystatin, and 1 mL of 25 mg/mL streptomycin.\nUnder a laminar flow, pour the cooled medium into 60 mm x 15 mm sterile Petri dishes. Let the plates solidify for 2 h. These plates can be kept for 1 month at 4 °C.\n2. Propagation of C. elegans\nSpot 100 μL of overnight grown E. coli OP50 onto the center of each NGM plate and allow the plates to dry for 24 h in a laminar hood. Subsequently, the plates can be stored in polystyrene container.\n\tNOTE: The E. coli OP50 culture is grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) media at 37 °C media prior to seeding of the plates. The culture can be stored at 4 °C for 1–2 months and used for periodic seeding of plates.",
    "Using a sterile worm pick, gather 10–12 gravid adult worms from a previously grown plate under a dissecting microscope. Transfer these worms to a fresh NGM plate seeded with E. coli OP50 and incubate the plate for 24 h at 20 °C.\nAfter 24 h, using a sterile worm-pick remove adult worms from the plates. Incubate the plates at 20 °C for ~ 3 days. Embryos will develop into gravid adult worms.\n3. Preparation of a synchronous C. elegans culture\nCollect gravid adult worms into a 15 mL conical tube by washing 2–4 plates with M9W.\n\t\nPreparation of M9W: Dissolve 5 g of NaCl, 6 g of Na2HPO4, and 3 g of KH2PO4 in deionized water to a final volume of 1 L. Autoclave the solution at 121 °C at a pressure of 15 lb/in2 for 30 min. Add 1 mL of 1 M MgSO4 to the cooled solution.\nPellet the worms by centrifuging the tube at 450 x g for 1 min. Decant the supernatant without disturbing the worm pellet.\nPrepare worm lysis solution by combining 400 μL of 8.25% sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) and 100 μL of 5 N NaOH. Add this solution to the worm pellet and flick the tube to mix contents of the tube. Prevent overbleaching of the embryos in the tube by observing the lysis of the worms under a dissecting microscope.\nAdd 10 mL of M9W to the conical tube to dilute the lysis mix when 70% of the adult worms have lysed.\nCentrifuge the tube at 450 x g for 1 min. Replace the supernatant with 10 mL of M9W.\nRepeat step 3.5 two times.",
    "After completing the washing steps, add 3–5 mL of M9W to resuspend the egg pellet. Rotate the tube overnight at a speed of 18 rpm on a tube rotator at room temperature (RT).\nAfter overnight incubation, remove the tube from the rotator, pellet the L1 larvae by centrifuging the tube at 450 x g for 1 min. Aspirate the M9W until 250 μL is left in the tube.\nShake the tube to resuspend the larvae. Add three 5 μL drops containing the larvae onto a Petri dish lid. Using a dissecting microscope count the number of worms in each drop and determine the number of worms in 1 μL.\n4. Preparation of drug assays\nNOTE: The steps in this assay are shown in Figure 1.\nGrow 30 mL of E. coli OP50 in a 50 mL conical tube at 37 °C overnight in an orbital shaker at 150 rpm.\nSpin overnight grown E. coli OP50 culture at 4,000 x g for 10 min to pellet the cells. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 3 mL of M9W to concentrate the culture.\nPrior to preparing the working solutions for the drug assay, add 0.1 mL of (5 mg/mL in 95% ethanol) cholesterol into 100 mL of M9W.\nPrepare working solutions of each experimental drug by diluting each drug plus vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide; DMSO) in 4.8 mL M9W supplemented with cholesterol to obtain the appropriate concentrations. Dissolve DMSO in 4.8 mL of M9W supplemented with cholesterol to prepare the vehicle control.\nAdd 200 μL of concentrated E. coli OP50 culture to each tube containing the vehicle control or drugs and vortex tubes to ensure they are mixed.",
    "To perform the experiment, add 2 mL of each working drug solution or vehicle control to each well in a 12-well tissue culture plate. Test each drug concentration and vehicle control in duplicate.\nAdd ~100 L1 larvae per well (see synchronous C. elegans culture steps) using a sterile micropipette. Limit the volume of worms to 10 μL.\nIncubate the plates at 20 °C.\nSupplement wells with 50 μL of 10x concentrated E. coli OP50 on day 3 of the assay if needed.\n5. Agarose pad preparation for microscopy\nPrepare a 2% w/v solution of agarose by dissolving 0.1 g of agarose in 5 mL of deionized water. Heat the contents in a microwave to dissolve the agarose. 20 slides can be prepared from 5 mL of agarose solution.\nPlace strips of lab tape along two glass slides. The tape will act as spacers limiting the thickness of the agarose pads. Thereafter, place a third clean glass slide between the taped slides.\nTo make an agarose pad, spot 100 μL of molten agarose onto the center of the clean slide. Place another clean glass slide across and on top of the agarose and gently press down to form a pad. Remove the top slide when the pad has solidified.\n6. Observation of the Muv phenotype in the let-60, let-23 and lin-1 strains\nNOTE: Only candidate drugs that suppress the Muv phenotypes in let-23 and let-60 strains will be assayed using the lin-1 strain to determine if the inhibition occurs at the level of RAS or EGFR.\nWhen the appropriate stage of the life cycle is reached (3 days for the let-60 and let-23 strains, 5 days for the lin-1 strain), remove the plates from the incubator. and collect the worms in 15 mL conical tubes using a pipette.",
    "Centrifuge the tubes at 450 x g for 1 min. Remove M9W without disturbing the worm pellet and add 5 mL of fresh M9W.\nRepeat step 6.2 two times.\nWithout disturbing the worm pellet, remove all remaining M9W by aspiration. Thereafter, add 500 μL of 2 mM sodium azide or 2 mM tetramisole hydrochloride. Allow tubes to incubate at RT for 15 min. 2 mM sodium azide or 2 mM tetramisole hydrochloride will anesthetize the worms for imaging.\n\tCAUTION: Make sure to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling sodium azide. The solution must be prepared under a chemical hood.\nAdd 10 μL of the anesthetized worm suspension onto the center of an agarose pad. Place a #1.5 coverslip gently over the worm suspension. If needed, fix the coverslip with some nail polish to prevent drying out.\nUse a DIC microscope to observe the let-60(n1046), let-23(sa62) and lin-1(sy254) strains. Image the worms at the 10x and 20x magnifications.\nFor let-60(n1046) and let-23(sa62), score the adult worms based on the presence or absence of the Muv phenotype. While for the lin-1 strain, count the number VPCs that adopted 1° or 2° cell fates on the ventral side of L4 larvae using a high resolution DIC microscope.\nAfter scoring the micrographs for each strain and drug treatment, perform Student’s t-test to determine the statistical differences between the treatments.\nSubscription Required.
