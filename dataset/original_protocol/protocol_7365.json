    "Design of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) for RNA capture  Choose a target gene for pull down. The protocol described here is equally suitable for long non-coding RNAs and protein-coding transcripts.Design 20-mers complementary to exons of the RNA sequence. Here, 100% sequence identity is required; design at least two ASOs for the target sequence as well as a negative control [e.g., peptidylprolyl isomerase B (PPIB)]. It is recommended to start with up to ten individual ASOs for new targets tiling the entire length of the mature transcript, as not every ASO will result in an efficient pull down.Use Nucleotide BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi[href=https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi]) to ensure the ASOs are specific to the intended target only. Stringency is important at this step—even one or two mismatches can result in unwanted off-target pull downs.ASOs used in pull-down experiments carry a modified 3’ end with biotin to assist in capture. In the United States, 3’ biotin modifications can be ordered, for example, from LGC Biosearch Technologies. We generally prefer a 50 nmol scale with a 3’ biotin, six carbon linker, and reverse-phase cartridge purification.Upon arrival, resuspend lyophilized ASOs in sterile DPBS to a working stock concentration of 200 µM.Store at 4 °C for short-term storage (up to one week) or at -20 °C for long-term storage. Aliquot to avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Preparation of cell lysate  Prepare a master mix of cell lysis buffer (see Recipe 1). The volume of each reaction is 500 μL, which can be scaled up if needed.Obtain a 10 cm plate at 70%–80% confluence of the cell lines of interest. Place on ice and aspirate the medium. Wash twice with 1× DPBS.Leave the plate tilted for a minute to remove all of the residual PBS. This is to prevent dilution of the lysis buffer.",
    "Lyse the cells on the plate using approximately 1 mL of cell lysis buffer per plate on ice for 10 min; then, harvest cells by scraping and transfer to low adhesion microcentrifuge tubes.Spin down lysate at 13,000  × g  for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet debris.If harvesting from multiple plates and using multiple Eppendorf tubes, combine and mix supernatant lysate in a 15 mL conical tube before proceeding to the capture step.(Highly recommended) Perform a BCA assay on the cell lysate. Adjust the cell lysate to a concentration of 0.3 mg/mL using cell lysis buffer. Note: While this step is optional, we highly recommend for it to be performed. We have found that in general, a 0.3 mg/mL protein concentration provides the optimum balance between pull-down efficiency and protein yield for peptide detection, as the cell input for this protocol is very low compared to previously published protocols (seeFigure 1below). As lysate protein concentration increases, we observe that yield decreases as seen inFigure 2below.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4572/bioprotoc-12-24-4572-g001.jpg Figure 1. SOCRATES requires 150,000 cells as input.   SOCRATES  input cell number requirement is much lower than current methods (West et al., 2014; Chu et al., 2015; McHugh et al., 2015).

Lysate protein concentration affects pull-down efficiency.  In this case, a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/mL would be optimal to pull down  RMRP, a 286 nt transcript. Anti-sense capture with ASOs and magnetic beads  From the lysate stock, aliquot 50 μL for 10% RNA input and 50 μL for 10% protein input, if needed. Leave the tubes on ice for the whole duration of the pull down.",
    "Do not add TRIzol to the input until the pull-down samples are in TRIzol at the end of this protocol.Aliquot 500 μL of lysate stock per sample and add 100 pmol of oligonucleotide to make a final concentration of 200 nM. This is generally 0.5 μL of the 200 µM stock. Do not vortex. Note: Extra lysate can be labelled and stored at -80 °C for future validation experiments such as western blot.  Incubate at room temperature for 1 h with gentle agitation on the rotator. Note: As a general note for mass spectrometry and pull-down experiments, it is very important to adhere to the same protocol for each replicate. Any deviation should be recorded in the event of inconsistent results. In addition, fluctuations in room temperature (e.g., 20–28 °C) may also be a source of error that may be compounded throughout the experiment. Take care not to vortex the sample prior to capture with the magnetic beads.  While the samples are incubating, prepare the Dynabeads by aliquoting 100 μL per reaction into a fresh Eppendorf tube for each reaction and place on the magnetic stand for 2 min to capture the beads.Remove the Dynabeads storage buffer gently and wash twice with 100 µL of lysis buffer, capturing the beads for 2 min in between washes. Basic lysis buffer without protease inhibitor cocktail and RNase inhibitor can be used here as well.Remove the lysis wash buffer and remove the beads from the magnet. Place on ice until ready to use.Add samples to the washed Dynabeads and incubate at room temperature for 30 min with the same gentle agitation. Do not vortex.Once the incubation is done, place the samples on a magnetic stand on ice to capture the beads for 2 min.",
    "Wash the beads three times with 800 µL of basic lysis buffer. Allow 2 min between washes for bead capture on the stand. Take care to remove all buffer, as any remaining will interfere with the elution process. Elution of RNA and protein from capture ASOs  Preheat a thermocycler to 40 °C.Very carefully resuspend beads in 90 µL of ice cold 100 mM TEAB by pipetting up and down and transfer to a 0.2 mL PCR tube or a PCR tube compatible with the thermocycler.Incubate the sample at 40 °C for  exactly  10 min and immediately place on ice afterwards. Note: In our experience, the vast majority of the oligonucleotides that we have tested achieve >95% elution at 40 °C. However, if elution is not fully achieved at that temperature, another oligonucleotide should be chosen or a temperature curve can be performed in order to identify the optimum elution temperature, as inFigure 3below.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4572/bioprotoc-12-24-4572-g003.jpg Figure 3. Temperature elution curve for  PHAROH  .   PHAROH  ’s optimal elution temperature is 40 °C; >95% has been eluted off the beads and only <5% remained on the beads.Allow the samples to cool on ice for 15 s. Perform a quick spin and place the sample on a magnetic stand on ice compatible with PCR tubes.Leave the samples in the magnetic stand for 60 s to capture the beads. Very carefully remove the eluate and transfer to a new Eppendorf tube. Note: Removing the eluate from the beads is a critical step. After performing temperature elution, do not wait longer than one minute to transfer the eluate. The RNA will rebind to the capture oligonucleotide over time and efficiencies will not be accurate. Process in batches if handling many samples.",
    "Immediately aliquot 30 µL for mass spectrometry, 30 µL for RNA, and the remaining for immunoblots. As TEAB is a volatile compound, take care when pipetting.Add 1 mL of TRIzol to the RNA aliquot as well as the input that was set aside in the beginning of the experiment. Store protein samples at -20 °C until ready to process. Proceed to cDNA synthesis and qPCR analysis with the RNA samples. Note: Ideally, the samples should be processed within 24 h for consistency, but they are stable in TRIzol for up to one month. Care must be taken in order to have consistent results across replicates.   cDNA synthesis and qPCR to analyze pull-down efficiency  Isolate RNA from pull-down samples according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Addition of glycogen (GlycoBlue) is necessary in order to ensure complete extraction of RNA.Allow the RNA pellet to air dry for 5 min. Resuspend in 8 µL of nuclease-free water.Perform DNase digestion to remove any potentially co-purified genomic DNA by adding 1 µL of 10× DNase reaction buffer and 1 µL (1 U/µL) of DNase I to the RNA sample (total volume: 10 µL).Mix reaction by gently pipetting up and down. Spin briefly in a microcentrifuge.Incubate reaction at 25 °C in a PCR machine for 15 min.Add 1 µL of 25 mM EDTA.Mix reaction by gently pipetting up and down. Spin briefly in a microcentrifuge.Inactivate reaction at 65 °C in a PCR cycler for 10 min.Transfer samples on ice immediately after the 10 min incubation is completed. Do not leave samples in the PCR machine while ramping down to room temperature.Prepare cDNA master mix (see Recipe 2).Add 39 µL of cDNA master mix to samples on ice.Mix reaction by gently pipetting up and down. Spin briefly in a microcentrifuge.",
    "Perform the following incubation in a PCR machine for cDNA synthesis:25 °C for 10 min48 °C for 30 min95 °C for 5 mincDNA can be stored short-term at 4 °C or long-term at -20 °C.Prepare qPCR master mix (see Recipe 3) containing primers for the target gene as well as qPCR master mix containing primers for an internal control (housekeeping) gene. When calculating the quantity of master mix needed, consider that samples will be pipetted in triplicates. Note: For optimal results, primers for qPCR should not overlap with the capture oligonucleotide binding site, and the capture oligonucleotide should not bind within the qPCR amplified region.  Commonly used genes for internal controls include beta-actin,  GAPDH  , or ribosomal protein genes. Internal controls should be chosen carefully; their expression level should be consistent and independent of experimental conditions such as ASO treatments. The expression level of an internal control gene should be in the same range as the target gene. General rules regarding qPCR experiments and qPCR primer design can be found in Bustin et al. (2009).Prepare a 96-well plate on ice.Add 15 µL of master mix containing either the target gene or internal control gene primers to the wells.Dilute the prepared cDNA 1:3 by adding 100 µL of nuclease-free water to each reaction.Pipette 5 µL of diluted cDNA into one well of the 96-well plate. Each sample will be pipetted in triplicate for both the target and the housekeeping gene (= six wells containing 5 µL of cDNA per sample).Seal the 96-well plate with an optical adhesive film. Avoid touching the film with your gloves, handling carefully by the edges.Spin down the plate at 100  × g  for 1 min at room temperature.",
    "Place the plate in the qPCR machine and run the following program:95 °C for 10 min40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s60 °C for 60 sFollowed byMelt curve 95 °C→60 °C, 1 °C/minAfter pull-down analysis, choose the best two oligonucleotides with the highest pull-down efficiency (ideally >70%) for the target gene and control gene and submit the eluate for digestion, iTRAQ 4-plex labelling, and sequencing at the mass spectrometry facility. Note: Submission for digestion and labelling should occur within 24 h of obtaining the eluate if possible. The samples can be kept at -20 °C until the pull-down efficiency for the batch is confirmed via qRT-PCR. Lastly, TEAB is highly volatile, so care must be taken when handling this reagent."
