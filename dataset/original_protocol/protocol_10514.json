    "NOTE: Ethics Statement: The current work is unique to the institution’s research policy, and strictly follows the appropriate bio-safety and Office of Regulatory Compliance (ORC) guidelines.\n1. Biomaterial Specimen Procurement\nWear personal protective equipment in accordance with standard biosafety protocols of the laboratory and/or institution. Wear closed-toed shoes, long pants, a lab coat, surgical gloves, a protective mask, and safety goggles while handling porcine tissue and testing.\nObtain porcine tissue (head, abdomen, or hind leg) of healthy pigs from a local abattoir within 1-2 hr post mortem.\nStore porcine tissue in biohazard safety bags and then place them in an iced container (~5.56-7.22 °C).\n\tNOTE: Use a thermometer to check that the temperature in the porcine specimen does not drop below 7.22 °C.\nTransport porcine tissue to the nearest laboratory (at the College of Veterinary Medicine in Mississippi State University) for dissection.\nUnder the supervision of a veterinarian in the College of Veterinary Medicine, surgically extract porcine organ (brain, liver, muscle, fat, or tendon) and place them in containers filled with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for temporary storage (pH 7.4).\nStore the PBS containers in an iced cooler (~5.56-7.22 °C) and immediately transport them to the testing facility for sample preparation and SHPB testing.\n2. Biomaterial Sample Preparation\nRemove the porcine organ from the PBS container and place it on a sterile surface.\nNOTE: Identify the primary fiber orientation and locations for each test sample. Use a cylindrical die with a 30 mm inner diameter to dissect the test sample from the porcine organ.\nIf the test sample is wedged inside the cylindrical die, inject PBS through the opposite end of the dissection tool to allow the test sample to slide out intact. Place the extracted test sample on a separate area of the sterile surface.",
    "Use a scalpel to trim the sample to the prescribed thickness and aspect ratio.\n\tNOTE: For SHPB testing of porcine samples, the thickness is 10-15 mm while the aspect ratio (thickness/diameter) is 0.33-0.50 (Figure 2).\nUse calipers to measure the thickness and diameter at three different locations.\nStore all test samples in fresh PBS until the SHPB device is ready for testing.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that samples are tested within 4 hr after slaughter.\nDiscard samples that are not cylindrical due to incision errors or variations in the cross-section. Place discarded samples in biohazard safety bags. Repeat steps 2.2-2.6 to obtain additional test samples.\n3. Split-Hopkinson Pressure Bar Testing\nPlace the striker bar, incident bar, and transmitted bar in the metal stanchions for SHPB testing.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that bars are free moving to the touch and that their interfaces are aligned with each other. Provide a stopper for transmitted bar for safety.\nConnect the strain gages adhered to incident and transmitted bars to the signal amplifier. Turn on the signal conditioning amplifiers and the DAQ module computer.\nInitialize the high speed data capturing software.\nVerify the live capturing of the signals to see if they lie within the normal range, and nullify the noise signals by clicking the zero icon.\nInput the trigger level and the data rate (2 MHz).\nInitialize the software to record once the trigger level has been achieved.\nLoad the striker bar adjacent to the pressure chamber. Fill the pressure chamber to a desired pressure.\n\tNOTE: The typical pressure range is 5-25 psi.\nZero out the laser speed meter by pressing the zero button and set it to read the striker bar velocity by setting the reflector strip on the striker bar behind the laser sensors.",
    "Place the sample confinement chamber such that it does not hinder the movement of incident and reflected bar. Place the incident bar in contact with the transmitted bar.\nFor calibration purposes, run a test (without a sample) by turning on trigger switch for the pressure chamber on the striker bar.\nOnce the data is acquired in the computer, save and analyze the SHPB strain gage data (which is discussed in the next section) to ensure that the testing procedure is functioning properly.\nPlace the cylindrical sample between the incident and transmitted bar and then close the sample confinement chamber.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that no pre-conditioning is performed on the sample.\nPerform Tasks 3.4-3.7 with the sample placed between the incident and transmitted bar.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that the sample centerline is the same as the bar centerline. Before proceeding, also check that the sample is not compressed, but remains in the same geometry as previously extracted.\nAfter testing is complete, use disposable sanitary wipes to remove sample debris from the incident bar, transmitted bar, and sample confinement chamber. Dispose of all debris and wipes in biohazard safety bags.\nSanitize the bars and sample confinement chamber using a 70% ethanol cleaning solution and sanitary wipes.\n4. SHPB Data Post-processing\nOpen the “MSU High Rate Software19” for analysis of Hopkinson Bar waves.\nBegin the software by examining the Settings window and choosing the “Tension/Compression” option in the Mode Tab for uniaxial testing. Also, select “2 Gages” in the Gages Tab and click “Continue.”\nIn the Main Window, select the Open File 1 Tab, and navigate to the incident wave data from the strain gage record on the incident bar. Select the Open File 2 Tab for importing the transmitted bar strain gage record.",
    "Select the Parameters Tab in the Main Window and input the physical parameters of the test setup including: bar dimensions, voltage to strain factors, strain gage positions, and viscoelastic dispersion constants. Click “Continue.”\nThen select the Select Data Tab in the Main Window and use the cursor bars to reduce the dataset to only the amount of data containing the incident, reflected, and transmitted waves. Click “Continue.”\nThen select the Select Waves Tab in the Main Window and use the cursor bars to confine the incident wave in the Incident Wave Graph, the reflected wave in the Reflected Wave Graph, and the transmitted wave in the Transmitted Wave Graph. Click “Continue.”\nAfter that, select the Correct Tab in the Main Window to allow the software to correct for the viscoelastic dispersion20-21.\nNow select the Shift Tab in the Main Window. In the Wave Graph, use the cursor to drag the incident, reflected, and transmitted waves to the same initial position in time by selecting each one individually in the Wave Select Tab. View all of the waves in the Data Graph. Once completed, click “Continue.”\nIn the results file, save the load, displacement, position, and velocity, profiles by clicking “Save As.”\nUse conventional methods in Microsoft Excel (or any other spreadsheet software) to calculate true stress and true strain using the specimen dimensions measured before the Hopkinson Bar test.\n5. SHPB Finite Element Modeling\nUsing commercial finite element (FE) software, create a FE model of the SHPB setup.\n\tNOTE: Use the same geometries and material properties.\nAssign an initial velocity to the FE model of the striker bar to initialize the FE simulation.\n\tNOTE: The velocity of the striker bar should correspond to that in the SHPB experiment for a particular strain rate9.",
    "Create a FE model of the SHPB setup without a sample placed between the incident and transmitted bars. Run the FE simulation.\n\tNOTE: The simulated striker bar velocity should correspond to the experimental striker bar velocity under the “no-sample” condition. Assign material properties given in Table 1 for polymeric bars.\nVerify if the strain gage measurements (stain versus time) in the experiment and FE simulation are in good agreement.\nIncorporate the biomaterial sample into the FE model of the SHPB setup. Assign the three-dimensional implementation (in vumat file format22) of the ISV material model to the biomaterial sample11.\nPerform a mesh refinement study using three different mesh sizes and then analyze the results to determine if the solutions converge.\n\tNOTE: The mesh size corresponds to the total number of hexahedral and/or tetrahedral elements that comprise the FE model. Select the FE model with the lowest mesh size that converges after further simulations9.\nConduct the two-step FE model calibration. In the first step, upload the experimental data into the one-dimensional implement of the ISV material model.\nCalibrate the true stress-stain curve of the experiment with the model’s true stress-strain curve by adjusting the ISV material model’s parameters (see Table 1).\n\tNOTE: Further iterations are needed because the experimental SHPB data is three-dimensional in nature while the material model is one-dimensional.\nAssign the ISV material constants to the biomaterial sample in the FE model of the SHPB setup.\nRun the FE simulation with the striker bar velocity and sample deformation strain rate corresponding to the SHPB tests at the same strain rate.\nCompare the strain gage measurements from experiment and FE simulation for good agreement (strain versus time).",
    "NOTE: If there is good agreement between the FE simulations and experiment strain gage values, proceed to the second step of the model calibration process. If not, repeat Tasks 5.7-5.11.\nIn the second step of the FE model calibration, run the FE simulation strain gage data SHPB experiment post-processing software, MSU High Rate software19-21.\n\tNOTE: If the simulated true stress-strain response compares to the experimental true stress-strain response, then the two-step FE model calibration has been completed. If not, repeat Tasks 5.7-5.12.\nPerform a volume average of the loading direction (Σ33) stress along the centerline elements of the FE model sample.\n\tNOTE: If this stress is in good agreement with the stress-strain curve of the one-dimensional ISV material model result, then the results obtained through Tasks 5.7-5.12 are fully calibrated. If not, repeat Tasks 5.7-5.13. The true stress-strain response captured through the one-dimensional implementation of the ISV material model represents the uniaxial true stress-strain response of a biomaterial that was tested in a SHPB setup.\nSubscription Required.
