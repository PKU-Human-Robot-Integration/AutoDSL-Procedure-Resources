    "A growth rate experiment of A. vinelandii begins with strain recovery from frozen stocks. A. vinelandii stocks are typically kept in a 7% DMSO storage buffer and stored at –80°C. Frozen cells can then be directly streaked on solid medium to prepare isogenic plate cultures for subsequent growth rate assessments.\nA. vinelandii is generally grown in Burk's medium (B medium; see Reagents and Solutions), which may be supplemented with a nitrogen source (BN medium), antibiotics, or modified trace metals as desired. This protocol describes recovery on BN plates (rather than B plates) so that cells can be grown regardless of the diazotrophic capabilities of the strain, which can later be assessed during the growth rate experiment. If needed, recovery can also be accomplished with BN plates supplemented with antibiotics.\nMaterials\nA. vinelandii (ATCC BAA-1303) frozen stock on ice\nBN solid medium plates (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.57#cpz157-rec-0002])\nBunsen burner\nBiosafety cabinet (optional)\nInoculation loops or needles (sterile)\n30°C incubator\n4°C refrigerator (as needed)\n−80°C freezer\n1. Use a sterile inoculation loop or needle to streak a small amount (enough to be just visible on the tip of the inoculation tool) of frozen cells onto a BN plate. Streak for isolation, and immediately return frozen stock to –80°C.\nFollow proper aseptic technique to minimize risk of contamination. Work should be performed near a Bunsen burner or in a biosafety cabinet.\n2. Incubate plates for 2 to 3 days at 30°C.\nTo prevent plates from drying, keep a small beaker of sterile water in the incubator or seal the plate with parafilm. Cells plated on BN medium typically range from greenish yellow (when dense) to cream in color. Plates can be sealed with parafilm and stored up to 1 month at 4°C.",
    "3. Use a sterile inoculation loop or needle to patch one full-sized colony onto a fresh BN plate.\nPatch one colony for each planned growth experiment replicate to account for potential genetic variation within the bacterial stock. BN plates should be split into four patched sections at most to ensure sufficient cells for subsequent inoculation into liquid medium.\n4. Incubate plates for 2 to 3 days at 30°C.\nUse patched cells for growth rate experiments as soon as possible, and no more than a week after storage at 4°C.",
    "Preparation of A. vinelandii liquid precultures prior to the growth rate experiment is necessary to produce inocula that are in a consistent physiological state across different strains and replicates. The age of the preculture at the time of inoculation into the primary growth culture can be optimized as needed. A saturated preculture tends to provide a longer and more easily detectable lag phase for curve fitting in downstream growth rate analyses. Furthermore, it minimizes the volume of preculture needed to inoculate the primary culture, which can introduce undesirable residual medium additions (such as supplemental nitrogen) from the preculture that result in a variable lag phase.\nMaterials\nIsogenic A. vinelandii plate culture (from Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.57#cpz157-prot-0001])\nBN medium (sterile; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.57#cpz157-rec-0003])\nGlass 125-ml flasks capped with aluminum foil (sterile)\nSerological pipets (sterile)\nInoculation loops or needles (sterile)\nVortex (optional)\n30°C shaking incubator\n1. Using a serological pipet, transfer 50 ml sterile, room temperature BN liquid medium into a 125-ml glass flask.\nFollow proper aseptic technique. Work should be performed near a Bunsen burner or in a biosafety cabinet. Other medium volumes and flask sizes can be used, as long as there is sufficient aeration during shaking. 50 ml medium will provide more than enough material for subsequent inoculation of the main growth culture. Antibiotics can be added here or later in the main culture if needed.\n2. Use a sterile inoculation loop or needle to inoculate the BN liquid medium with A. vinelandii cells (full ∼1 to 5 μl loop). Let cells sit in liquid medium for ∼5 min, then swirl or vortex to completely resuspend.\n3. Shake liquid culture for 24 hr at 30°C and 300 rpm.",
    "See Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.57#cpz157-prot-0002] introduction for discussion of preculture age. Saturated cultures in BN medium are typically light cream in color but can be tinged green depending on the strain and/or growth conditions (see Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.57#cpz157-fig-0003]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/952e6002-6771-4356-b1c3-0d15c44f95af/cpz157-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nA. vinelandii DJ liquid culture in BN media after 24 hr of growth at 30°C shaken at 300 rpm (right) and the BN control (left).",
    "This protocol focuses on the automated assessment of A. vinelandii diazotrophic growth in B (nitrogen-free) medium on a microplate reader. Liquid precultures grown in BN (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.57#cpz157-prot-0002]) are used to inoculate B medium to a desired starting optical density at 600 nm (OD600) for the growth rate experiment. In B medium, A. vinelandii quickly use up any residual ammonia from the preculture and begin expressing nitrogenase genes for nitrogen fixation. Detected growth is, thus, directly related to the strain's ability to express nitrogenase and grow diazotrophically. Experiments targeting other aspects of A. vinelandii physiology can be designed by modifying the preculture and primary culture medium with, for example, antibiotics or different concentrations of trace metals. Over the course of the growth rate experiment, the microplate reader can provide automated temperature control, shaking, and optical density measurements, all parameters which can be varied to test different growth conditions as permitted by the instrument capabilities.\nMaterials\nA. vinelandii saturated preculture in BN medium (from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.57#cpz157-prot-0002])\nB medium (sterile; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.57#cpz157-rec-0003])\nGlass flasks (sterile)\nSerological pipets (sterile)\n96-well microplates, clear, flat-bottomed (sterile) (Greiner Bio-One, cat. no. 655161)\nMultichannel pipette\n50-ml pipetting reservoirs (sterile)\nMicroplate lid (optional) (Greiner Bio-One, cat. no. 656171)\nGas-permeable microplate membrane (optional) (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. Z380059)\nMicroplate reader (Tecan Spark, cat. no. 30086376)\nPrepare the primary growth culture\n1. In a sterile glass flask (or other small vessel), prepare a 1:10 dilution of the A. vinelandii preculture in sterile B medium (e.g., 1 ml preculture in 9 ml B medium). Swirl gently to mix.\nFollow proper aseptic technique. Work should be performed near a Bunsen burner or in a biosafety cabinet.",
    "2. Transfer 125 μl of the diluted A. vinelandii preculture to a single well of a 96-well microplate. In addition, transfer 125 μl of sterile B medium to a separate well to serve as blank reference for the absorbance reading.\nThe sample volume in the microplate well determines the length of the light path, and thus affects absorbance readings. The volume used for OD600 measurement of the diluted preculture should also be used for the growth rate experiment, including blank wells.\nSample volume should be optimized beforehand (see Strategic Planning), particularly if alternate microplate formats (e.g., 384-well microplates) are used.\n3. Measure the OD600 of the diluted preculture on the microplate reader, taking a single absorbance reading of the wells.\nOD600 measurement of the initial diluted preculture should be performed using the same microplate reader that will be used for the growth rate experiment. This removes the potential for measurement variation across different spectrophotometers and ensures that the investigator accurately prepares the primary growth culture to the desired optical density. Zeroing using the blank reference can be performed automatically by the plate reader, or the blank absorbance reading can simply be subtracted from the preculture reading to determine the actual OD600 of the sample.\n4. Based on the initial OD600 value of the diluted preculture, in a glass flask (or other appropriate vessel), inoculate B medium to obtain a final OD600 of ∼0.05 for the main growth culture. Swirl gently to mix.",
    "Prepare a final volume that can sufficiently be aliquoted across the desired number of wells for the growth rate experiment. Note that excess volume may be needed to comfortably pipet from a reagent reservoir in the following step (e.g., for 125 μl across 96 wells, prepare >20 ml). Antibiotics can be added to the B medium prior to inoculation if desired.\nPrepare microplate and perform growth rate experiment\n5. Pour the primary growth culture into a reagent reservoir. Use a multichannel pipette to aliquot 125 μl across the wells of a microplate. Reserve at least one well to fill with 125 μl of B medium to serve as a blank reference for the experiment.\n6. Use a lid or gas-permeable membrane to cover the wells of the microplate.\nIf using a lid, note that significant evaporation can still occur for wells close to the edge of the microplate and it may be preferable to leave these wells empty (Chavez et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.57#cpz157-bib-0006]; Hall et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.57#cpz157-bib-0014]). If using a membrane, take care to ensure that there are minimal creases or bubbles when applied. Improper membrane application may lead to inconsistent growth rates across the microplate because these surface area differences influence aeration.\n7. Insert the prepared microplate into the reader, set the instrument parameters, and start the growth experiment program.\nMicroplate reader parameters that should be considered include:\n         \nTemperature (typically 30°C)\nShaking speed (typically ∼300 rpm)\nShaking mode (e.g., orbital)\nMeasurement interval (e.g., once per hour)\nExperiment duration (see below)\nAbsorbance wavelength (typically 600 nm) and other measurement parameters\n(e.g., single vs. multiple reads per well)",
    "These parameters should be optimized beforehand (see Strategic Planning). A. vinelandii cultures grown on a microplate reader typically reach saturation after ∼48 hr. However, growth should be monitored longer (up to ∼72 hr) to ensure sufficient duration of the stationary phase for curve fitting in downstream analyses. The appropriate experimental duration for mutant strains or modified growth conditions may vary.\n8. Save the growth experiment file and export for subsequent data analysis (see Strategic Planning and Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.57#cpz157-fig-0004]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/60908d7a-b913-436b-83f9-c6f782576527/cpz157-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nDiazotrophic growth curves for wild-type (WT) and engineered A. vinelandii strains.
