    "Extraction of lipid from plant tissue (Figure 1)Collect the plant tissue (Leaf/Stem/Root/Fruit) and quickly freeze the sample in liquid N2. To perform absolute quantification of fatty acids, determine the exact fresh weight (FW) of plant material quickly and accurately before freezing the sample. Store the sample at -80 °C in foil until further use.Critical Step: Sufficient plant material is necessary for the yield of satisfactory GC-MS signals. Usually, 100.00 to 500.00 mg tissue is enough for the analysis of fatty acid content. In this protocol, ~200 mg tissue is collected as one sample.Pause Point: Frozen samples can be stored at -80 °C. Homogenize ~200.00 mg of plant tissue in liquid N2 using mortar pestle and transfer the powder to a 50 ml graduated centrifuge tube.Add 5 ml of pre-cooled (4 °C) solvent extraction solution A (see Recipe 1) and spinix-vortex vigorously for 3 min.Centrifuge the sample for 10 min at 10,000 x g at 4 °C and collect the supernatant in a 50 ml flask A.Add 2.5 ml of pre-cooled solvent extraction solution B (see Recipe 2) to the pellet and vortex vigorously.Centrifuge sample for 10 min at 10,000 x g at 4 °C and transfer the supernatant in 50 ml flask A (Repeat the Steps A5-A6).Filter the pooled supernatant by gravity filtration method through Whatman filter paper 40 using a funnel and wash by mixing with an equal volume of potassium phosphate buffer (50 mM; pH-7.5).Centrifuge the mixture for 10 min at 10,000 x g at 4 °C and collect the lower organic phase into a 50 ml graduated centrifuge tube. Collect the lower phase with a glass pipette.Dry total lipids under N2 using a sample concentrator and determine total lipid contents gravimetrically.Pause Point: Total dried lipid can be stored at -20 °C prior to further analysis.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180912/20180912012828_3359.jpgFigure 1.",
    "Workflow of extraction of total lipid from plant tissue Conversion of lipid to fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) by transmethylation (Figure 2)Dissolve ~1-10 mg of total lipid in 1 ml of methanolic NaOH (see Recipe 3) and transfer in Pyrex culture tube.Heat for 15 min at 55 °C in a water bath.Add 2 ml of methanolic HCl (see Recipe 4) and vortex for 20 sec.Again heat for 15 min at 55 °C in the water bath.Add 10 μl of 1 mg ml-1 nonadecanoic acid (C19:0) into the lipid samples as an internal standard.FAMEs extract through Rotospin-Rotary mixer (Tarson) by adding 1 ml of water (Milli Q) and subsequently add 2 ml of 100 % hexane.Transfer upper phase (~2 ml) into a fresh Pyrex culture tube.Extract FAMEs two more times each with 2 ml of 100% hexane and pool in the same Pyrex culture tube (Step B7).Dry the pooled FAMEs under N2 and finally dissolved in 100 μl of 100% hexane.Transfer the FAMEs thus eluted into glass inserts, to 2 ml clear GC vials.Pause Point: Samples can be stored in capped vials at -20 °C for a month.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180912/20180912012847_4957.jpgFigure 2. Workflow of conversion of lipid to fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) by transmethylation GC-MS analysis (Figure 3)Carry out GC-MS analysis of FAMEs samples by gas chromatography coupled with a mass spectrometer (GC-MS QP-2010, Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with an auto-sampler (AOC-5000) using flame ionization detection (FID) and RTx-5MS capillary column (Table 1).Use RTx-5MS capillary column (60 meters, 0.25 mm ID, and 0.5 μm df) from Rastek, USA with 1 ml min-1 flow rate of helium (99.9 % purity) as a carrier gas and a pre-column pressure of 112.9 kPa.",
    "Set the initial column temperature regime to 40 °C for 3 min, followed by a 5 °C min-1 increment up to 230 °C followed by 40 min at 230 °C. Following this, set the injection volume, time and temperature of 1 μl, 67 min and 230 °C respectively. Operate the mass spectrometer in electron compact mode with electron energy of 70 eV and keep the temperature of the ion sources and quadrupole at 200 °C.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180912/20180912012918_5971.jpgFigure 3.
