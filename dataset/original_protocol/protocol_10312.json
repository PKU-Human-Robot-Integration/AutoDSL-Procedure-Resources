    "Ethics statement: All of the in vivo animal experiments described were performed according to an approved protocol and under the ethical guidelines of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n1. Construction of a Nebulizing Device\nAttach wood part A (12.5 x 2.5 x 1.8 cm3) upright in the center of part B (12.7 x 10.7 x 1.8 cm3) using two screws (4 x 25 mm2). Attach wood part C (11 × 2.5 × 1.8 cm3) to the middle of part A (12.5 x 2.5 x 1.8 cm3) using one screw, such that part C (11 x 2.5 x 1.8 cm3) can still be moved. See Figure 1.\nDrill two holes through the lower tip of the spray bottle trigger of a plastic 3 oz mini sprayer (D) and push a stainless steel rod (10 cm of 1/16\" steel) (E) through to form two loops, one on either side of the trigger.\nWrap the bottom part of the spray bottle with duct tape (F) to prevent the cable ties from slipping off. Attach the spray bottle to wood part C (11 x 2.5 x 1.8 cm3) using the two plastic cable ties (28 cm) (G).\nCut off the 011 servo motor (I) and reconnect it with the loose cables of the servo control (H). Then, attach the servo motor to the top of wood part A (12.5 x 2.5 x 1.8 cm3) using duct tape.\nAttach a pencil (J) to the servo motor lever using the paper clip (K). Tightly connect the outermost parts of the pencil to the steel rod loops using plastic covered twist wires (L) and secure the ends on the pencil with duct tape.",
    "Cut off the servo motor control unit's magnetic cable connector (M) and reattach it to the speaker cable (N). Then, tape the servo motor control unit to wood part B (12.7 x 10.7 x 1.8 cm3). Cut a w1 cable with magnetic connectors in half and attach one part to the loose end of the copper speaker cable (1 m). Connect the (magnetic) i2 toggle switch and p1 power to the available w1 cable and a 9V battery.\n2. Sensitivity Determination of the Method\nIn a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, prepare solutions of [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 in reverse osmosis water (100 µL) in amounts of 260 µg (347 nmol), 52 µg (69 nmol), 26 µg (34 nmol), 5 µg (6.9 nmol), 3 µg (3.5 nmol), 520 ng (694 pmol), 260 ng (347 pmol), 52 ng (69 pmol), 26 ng (34 pmol), 5 ng (6.9 pmol), and 3 ng (3.5 pmol).\nMix 100 µL of each [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 solution with 100 µL of an aqueous solution of ammonium cerium nitrate ((NH4)2Ce(NO3)6) in water (25 mM) on a microscope slide.\nSet up the acquisition in the bioluminescence reader by initializing the imaging software.\nSign in to the user profile and look for the acquisition control panel. Click on \"Initialize\" and wait until the instrument is ready.\nLook for \"Imaging Mode\" and make sure \"Luminescent\" and \"Photograph\" are checked and that \"Fluorescent\" is unchecked.\nChange \"Exposure Time\" setting for \"Luminescent\" to 20 s. Set the remaining settings for \"Luminescent\" as follows: \"Binning\": Medium; \"F/stop\": 1; and \"Emission Filter\": Open.\n\t\tNOTE: The exposure times might need to be adapted according to the instrumentation and experimental setting used, if different from the presented setup.",
    "For \"Photograph,\" use the following settings: \"Exposure Time\": Auto; \"Binning\": Medium; and \"F/stop\": 8. Adjust the \"Subject Height\" according to imaging target.Look for the \"Field of View\" dropdown menu. The initial setting is \"C.\" Change to \"B\" (14 cm distance between the camera and sample stage).\nSet up the nebulizer by placing a microscopic slide on a sheet of black construction paper on the floor of the imaging chamber to protect it from the oxidizing agent. Mix a 100 µLdroplet of [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2-solution with 100 µL of an aqueous solution of (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6. Observe the green box crosshair.\nPlace the imaging subject on the black construction paper, such that the area of interest is in the center of the green light box crosshair displayed on the sample stage. Prepare the nebulizer by detaching the plastic spray bottle from the wooden support. Fill a solution of triethylamine (1:3 in water/ethanol) into its plastic reservoir and reattach it to the wooden support.\nPlace the nebulizer inside the bioluminescence reader and make sure that the power cord is disconnected from the nebulizer cord. Ensure that the power switch is on, the toggle switch is off, and the red LED is lit. Place the nebulizer such that the spray flow is pointed towards the area of interest on the imaging subject, while minimizing the view obstruction from the camera towards the imaging subject by the spray nozzle head.\nPlace small, black pieces of construction paper over any potential hot spots (e.g., white marks on microscopic slides or injection sites) to shield them from spray. Place at least 40 cm of the nebulizer remote cord inside the imaging chamber, such that it does not interfere with the imaging subject, the nebulizer, or the magnetic door latch. Close the imaging system door.",
    "NOTE: The crosshair will change size based on the \"Field of View\" setting in \"Living Image;\" make sure that this is set to \"B\".\nAcquire an image by initiating the imaging sequence. Click \"Acquire\" in the \"Acquisition Control Panel.\" On the first imaging sequence, enable autosaving if desired (recommended) and choose a data folder. Ignore the \"Edit Imaging Labels\" dialog until the end of the sequence.\n\tNOTE: The control software displays the instrument's actions step-by-step in real time. After preparing the measurement and moving the sample stage to the right position, it opens the camera shutter and counts the measurement time. The shutter opening can also be heard by a click sound generated by the machine.\nAs the shutter opens, spray three bursts of a solution of triethylamine (1:3 in water/ethanol, 0.24 ± 0.04 mL per spray burst) by switching the toggle switch three times to generate chemiluminescence.\n\tNOTE: The sample stage will move during the measurement. Leave enough (minimum 40 cm) cable inside the instrument to allow this. Make sure that the solution to be sprayed by the nebulizer can be aspired by the ascending pipe and that there are no air bubbles in the pipe. Have several spare batteries for the nebulizer ready in case needed.\n3. In Vivo Imaging After Systemic Intravenous Injection\nIn a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, prepare 100 µL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution containing between 8 and 33 nmol of [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2. Prepare an aqueous solution of (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6 in water (25 mM) at the same time.\nIntravenously inject 100 µL of [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 into the tail vein of healthy mice (n = 5).\nEuthanize the mice 10 min after injection via CO2 asphyxiation.",
    "Remove the skin with a Y-cut from the torso, then remove the costal arch in a U-shape to expose the heart and lungs. Perfuse the mice by cutting an outlet in the right atrium and injecting 20 mL of PBS through a 24 gauge needle into the left ventricle18. Carefully cut through the belly skin and expose the kidney and liver. Cut longitudinally through the organs to create a visible cut.\nSet up the acquisition as described in steps 2.3-2.6, with the following changes.\nAfter thoroughly washing the nebulizer plastic reservoir, fill it with a solution of (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6 in water (25 mM) instead of triethylamine.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important to thoroughly rinse the nebulizer nozzle after every use, since crystallizing (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6 may destroy the spray nozzle after several uses.\nUse the whole animal or organ samples for imaging.\nFor whole abdomen imaging, position the mouse carcass with the open abdomen facing the camera and the head pointing to the back of the instrument. Center the organ to be imaged (e.g., liver or kidney) in the green light box crosshair.\nFor individual organ imaging and quantification, remove the mouse from the imaging instrument and pin it down. Starting from the already-opened body cavity, excise the inner organs (e.g., kidney, liver, lung, muscle, spleen, brain, and heart). Cut through the hind leg skin to excise muscle tissue. Carefully open the skull with a scalpel to excise the brain.\n\t\t\nIf the organ of interest is liver, kidney or spleen, cut all organs in half longitudinally, place each organ on a petri dish or piece of black construction paper.\nFollow the procedure described in steps 2.3-2.6 to establish the relative emission of the chemiluminescent tracer for single organs.\n4. In Vivo Imaging of Lymph Nodes",
    "Prepare 10 µL of a PBS solution containing 80 nmol of [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2. Prepare an aqueous solution of (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6 in water (25 mM) at the same time.\nInject 10 µL of the solution subdermally into the hind paw of healthy mice (n = 5). As a negative control, inject the contralateral paw with 10 µL of pure PBS. Sacrifice the mice via CO2 asphyxiation 15 min after the injection. Remove the skin on both hind legs to expose the lymph canals up to the popliteal lymph nodes.\nSet up the acquisition as described in step 3.4.\nRemove the popliteal lymph nodes from both hind legs, cut them in half, and spray them with oxidant on a Petri dish, as described before (step 3.5.3), for the purpose of quantification.\nSubscription Required.
