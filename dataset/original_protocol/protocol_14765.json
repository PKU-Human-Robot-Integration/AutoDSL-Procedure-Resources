    "Ethics Statement: Approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine before subject recruitment began. All subjects provided written informed consent before participation in the study.\n1. Data Acquisition\nPressure Elevation\n\t\nTake baseline measurements (IOP and OCT measurements) by instilling one drop of 0.5% proparacaine into the eye. Wait 3 min for efficacy.\nGently apply pressure to the temporal sclera with the ophthalmodynamometer, 30 g in cohort 1, and 5 and then 10 g in cohort 2. Then take the desired (IOP and OCT) measurements as follows\n\t\t\nIOP Measurements\n\t\t\t\nMeasure baseline IOP. Elevate pressure as described in section 1.1.\nIn cohort 1 instill one drop of 0.5% proparacaine, allow 3 min for efficacy, and apply 30 g of pressure to the sclera. While pressure is being applied, measure IOP using the tonometer following manufacturer’s instructions.\nIn cohort 2, instill one drop of 0.5% proparacaine, allow 3 min for efficacy, and apply 5 g of scleral pressure using a ophthalmodynamometer. Measure IOP during pressure elevation using the tonometer following manufacturer’s instructions.\n\t\t\t\t\nWait 5 min after the 5 g measurement.\nApply 10 g of scleral pressure by ophthalmodynamometer, and measure IOP during pressure elevation using the tonometer following manufacturer’s instructions. Record the IOP and condition (i.e., baseline or 10 g) in the study record.\nOCT Scanning\n\t\t\t\nSeat the subject at the OCT scanner. Enter patient demographic data for new subjects, or recall demographic data from the OCT database for previously scanned subjects.\nSelect the anterior segment 512 x 128 scan protocol. Center the eye in the video image window. Decrease the distance between the scanner and eye until the cornea cross-sectional image appears in the scan window",
    "Using verbal commands position the temporal limbus to the center of the scan window by directing patient gaze in the nasal direction\nAcquire the baseline scan, and review the scan for quality. IF acceptable, save, and if not acceptable, repeat this step.\n\t\t\t\t\nAccept scans if there are no blinks, and the angle is visualized throughout the volume without drifting off of the edge of the image or flipping at the top.\nInstill one drop of 0.5% proparacaine, allow 3 min for efficacy, and repeat steps 1.3.2 through 1.3.5.\nFor cohort 1, apply 30 g of scleral pressure by ophthalmodynamometer, and acquire the scan while pressure is being applied. Remove the pressure and review the scan for quality. IF acceptable, save, and if not acceptable, repeat this step.\nFor cohort 2, apply 5 g of scleral pressure by ophthalmodynamometer, and acquire the scan while pressure is being applied. Remove the pressure and review the scan for quality. IF acceptable, save, and if not acceptable, repeat this step.\nWait 5 min allowing the eye to recover from the 5 g pressure perturbation.\nFor cohort 2, apply 10 g of scleral pressure by ophthalmodynamometer, and acquire the scan while pressure is being applied. Remove the pressure and review the scan for quality. IF acceptable, save, and if not acceptable, repeat this step.\nRecord the scan time, condition (i.e., baseline or 10 g) and location in the study record.\n2. Data Processing\nPlug a high-capacity USB storage device into the OCT. Select “Export” from the Records menu on the OCT. Designate a file location for exported files on the USB drive. De-select the “.zip” option. Enter the patient name for scans to be exported, and select the scans to be exported. Initiate the export.",
    "When the export completes, unmount the USB drive and remove from the OCT. Plug the high-capacity USB drive containing the exported images into the image processing workstation.\nLaunch the image processing program in this case ImageJ.\nImport the raw image data; select “File -> Import -> Raw” from the file menu. Select the file with ending in “_cube_raw.img” to be processed from the USB drive.\nSave the imported file using a new name, so that the original image data is saved unaltered (http://www.ori.dhhs.gov/education/products/RIandImages).\nEnter the import parameters as follows, Image type: 8 bit, Width: 512, Height: 1,024, Offset: 0; Number of images: 128.\nSelect “Plugins -> Registration -> StackReg” from the plugins menu. And then select the “Rigid Body” option. Then select “File -> Save As -> TIFF” to save the aligned stack.\nSelect “Process -> Filters -> Mean 3D” from the process menu. Enter the parameters X = 1, Y = 1, and Z = 1 as the filter options. Repeat this step twice.\nSelect “File -> Save As -> TIFF” to save the averaged stack. Spin the mouse wheel to move to frame 1 of the active stack.\nSelect “Process -> Enhance Local Contrast (CLAHE)” from the Processing menu. Use the parameters block size: 31, histogram bins: 256, Maximum Slope: 5, Mask: none, and check the “fast” option. Use the right arrow key to advance to the next frame.\nMove to frame 2 of the active stack and repeat the Process-> Enhance Local Contrast (CLAHE). Repeat until all frames have had contrast enhanced.\nSelect “File -> Save As -> TIFF” to save the contrast-enhanced stack. Then select “Image -> Adjust -> Size” from the Image menu. Deselect the “Constrain Aspect Ratio” option, then enter Width: 2,048 and height: 1,024 values.",
    "Select “Image -> Transform -> Flip Vertically” from the Image menu. Then select “Analyze -> Set Scale” from the Analyze menu. Enter Distance in pixels: 2,048, Known distance: 4,000, and Pixel Aspect Ratio: 1, and click OK. Select “File -> Save As -> TIFF” to save the calibrated 1:1 aspect ratio stack.\nSlowly spin the mouse wheel to visually examine the scans to identify a distinctive vessel crossing to serve as a point of reference within scans. Record the image number and reference frame number in the analysis spreadsheet.\nPress the left arrow key 15 times to go to the first measurement frame. Select the “Freehand Selections” tool from the toolbar.\nPlace the mouse in the center of SC and press the up arrow. Repeat this step until SC fills the screen.\nManually segment SC by circling the boundary with the mouse. Hold the control (Ctrl) key and press D for the current image frame. Hold the Ctrl key, and press M. Transcribe the measurement of SC cross-sectional area and measurement frame number to the analysis spreadsheet. De-select the outlined area. Press the right arrow key 3 times. Repeat this step until SC has been measured in 10 frames.\nPress the left arrow key 30 times to return to the first measurement frame.\nSelect the straight segment tool from the toolbar.\nDraw a straight line from the anterior-most to posterior-most locations on SC. Hold the control key and press D for the current frame only. Hold the control key and press M. Transcribe SC length and frame number to the analysis spreadsheet. De-select the outlined area. Press the right arrow key 3 times. Repeat this step until SC length has been measured in the same 10 frames as the SC cross-sectional area.",
    "Insert the equation SC-IOWD = SC-CSA / axial length into the analysis spreadsheet to calculate average SC inner-wall to outer-wall distance (SC-IOWD) by dividing the area measurements by the length measurements.\nPress the left arrow key 30 times to return to the first measurement frame.\nSelect the straight segment tool from the toolbar.\nDraw a straight line from the anterior-most on SC to the border of the trabecular meshwork and anterior chamber. Ensure that the line is perpendicular to the border. Hold Ctrl and press D, then M.\nDraw a line from the posterior-most location of SC and the border of the TM and the anterior chamber. Ensure that the line perpendicular to the border. Hold Control and press D, then M.\nDraw a line from the center of SC and the border of the TM and the anterior chamber. Ensure that the line perpendicular to the border. Hold the control key and press D for the current frame only.\nTranscribe the three TM thickness measurements and frame number to the analysis spreadsheet. To do this press the right arrow key 3 times. Repeat this step until TM thickness has been measured in the same 10 frames as the SC cross-sectional area.\nSubscription Required.
