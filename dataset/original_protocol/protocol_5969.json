    "After trypsinization, seed cells onto TPP dishes to achieve a confluence of 60%-90% at the time of transfection (Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181113/20181113214512_4658.jpgFigure 5. Timeline of the procedure. The entire process usually takes four days, including an overnight incubation post-transfection. In highly expressing cell lines such as BHK, our most commonly used line, this can be shortened to three days by reducing the post-transfection incubation step. Expression level can be empirically determined by fluorescence.Perform transfection using Lipofectamine 3000 with a 1:1 ratio of plasmid encoding cs-nanobody-APEX (Addgene 108874 or 108876), together with the following as required; plasmid encoding GFP- or mCherry-tagged protein of interest; plasmids encoding the putative interacting proteins of interest fused to the N- or C- terminal constructs of split GFP; appropriate control plasmids. To control for non-specific APEX labeling, as a minimum, we use one half of the split-GFP pair only (N or C) with the APEX-csGBP plasmid. Additional controls can be i) no transfection; ii) APEX-csGBP only; iii) known proteins that do not interact; iv) proteins of interest with the interacting domains rendered non-functional by mutagenesis (if this information is known, this is the ideal control). One microgram of each plasmid per 3 cm dish is used as standard.Incubate for 3 h, and then replace the culture medium. Incubate for a further 24 h. Note that certain cell types require addition of exogenous heme for maximal APEX activity. If necessary add bovine hemin to a final concentration of 7 µM 16 h or more prior to fixation.Remove the medium from the cells and wash 3 times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 2 min each (note that all washes are 3 ml per dish). Fix in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Wash three times in 0.",
    "1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (5 min each at RT). It is critical to perform the DAB reaction immediately after fixation. The DAB/cacodylate reaction and wash mixtures should be prepared during the fixation period.Wash for 2 min in DAB/cacodylate wash mixture. Replace with DAB/cacodylate reaction mixture (containing hydrogen peroxide) and incubate at room temperature for 30 min. Wash 3 times for 5 min with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate to remove free DAB.Post-fix in Osmium tetroxide solution for 2 min to convert the DAB reaction product into an electron dense stain. Wash three times each for 2 min in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer and an additional three times in double distilled H2O.Perform serial dehydration with increasing concentrations of ethanol in a PELCO BioWave fitted with a PELCO ColdSpot Pro system at 250 W (40 s incubation in 30% ethanol followed by 50%, 70%, 90% and 2 x 100%).Serially infiltrate with increasing concentrations (25%, 50%, 75% and 2 x 100%) of LX112 resin in ethanol in the Biowave at 250 W under vacuum for 3 min per step. Note: Dehydration and infiltration steps can be performed without the use of a microwave by increasing dehydration steps to 10 min each and resin infiltration steps to 60 min incubations with an overnight incubation for the final 100% step. Polymerize at 60 °C for 16-24 h. Separate the plastic tissue culture dish from resin embedded cells with pliers and prepare blocks for sectioning (Figure 6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181113/20181113214529_2293.jpgFigure 6. Resin embedded cells in blocks are separated from the plastic tissue culture dish (A) and mounted in the microtome chuck (B)Cut 60 nm sections using an ultramicrotome and a 45° diamond knife. Place sections on EM grids (e.g., formvar and carbon coated triple slot grids).",
