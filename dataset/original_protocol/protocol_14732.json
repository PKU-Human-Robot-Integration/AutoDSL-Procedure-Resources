    "All animal handling and procedures described herein, and according to the Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines, were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Association for Assessment of Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) International accredited Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California, Davis. Proper surgery should not result in signs of any pain or discomfort in the animal, but proper steps should be taken if these signs are observed, including administration of analgesics or in some cases, euthanasia. The right side of the animals was chosen arbitrarily for the unilateral procedure described.\n1. Unilateral Common Carotid Artery (CCA) Ligation\nPrepare sterile field with sterilized surgical tools and materials positioned conveniently. Ensure heating pad is warmed to 37 °C with temperature probe placed securely on the pad.  Be sure to use a sterile drape to cover the surgical site.  \nAnesthetize animal (isoflurane, 1-3% in air at 0.5-1 L/min), and place animal in a supine position with the tail facing away. Check anesthetization by pinching the toe - this should elicit no reaction if the animal is properly anesthetized. Apply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes.\nApply depilation cream to lower neck to upper chest area using 1-2 cotton swabs. Wait 1-3 min, and then remove hair and cream using wet gauze or alcohol swabs. Swab incision area with Betadine in a circular manner from inside to outside, and then change into sterile surgical gloves.\nUsing surgical scissors, make an incision of around 1 cm along the midline of the lower neck. Carefully separate outer skin from surrounding fascia using surgical scissors.\nUsing two McPherson micro iris suturing forceps, separate the right common carotid artery from fascia, taking care to avoid damaging veins or disturbing the vagus nerve.",
    "Using the forceps on the right, exteriorize the right CCA in a stable position. Apply several drops of saline to prevent drying. Pass a suitable length (2-3 cm) of 6-0 silk suture underneath the right CCA, and ligate using a double square knot. Optionally, ligate again using a second length of 6-0 silk suture.\nReposition right CCA and clean excess fluid from opening using a sterile sponge tipped swab. Close the incision with 6-0 silk suture. Apply lidocaine topically up to 7 mg/kg.\nAllow the animal to recover from anesthesia until ambulatory (approximately 30 min) and perform post-surgical monitoring until animal is ready for imaging.\n2. Preparation for Imaging: System and Hardware Checks\nSet up hardware and software for the MRI and PET systems and check their functionality as follows. Ensure all physical connections are secure and software settings are appropriately selected.\n\t\nEnsure the PET system is at the prescribed operating temperature of 5 °C using the air cooling system.\nMount PET system inside the MRI bore, aligning the PET and MRI field of view (FOV) centers using known axial offsets. Mount the MRI coil inside the bore of the PET system and center the coil with the PET system and MRI magnet centers.\nTurn on PET electronics for power and bias voltage (Note: steps will vary by instrument). Perform a quick (5 min) scan using a 68Ge cylinder and check the resulting sinogram to ensure all detectors are operational.",
    "Optionally acquire data to be used for a PET/MRI transformation matrix for co-registration purposes: Fill a three-dimensional phantom (e.g., three filled spheres) with 200 µCi of 18F aqueous solution and acquire for 15 min with PET. Acquire anatomical MRI data: in the Scan Control Window, select the multi-slice multi-echo (MSME) sequence (see Table 1). Repeat for all three major orientations: axial, sagittal, and coronal.\n Check the infusion pump settings and operation. Set the pump to 4.44 µl per minute, which in 45 min of constant infusion delivers a total volume of 200 µl, the typical recommended limit for i.v. injection in a 20 g animal.\nCheck the heater operation and confirm that the temperature output is sufficient to keep the animal warm (37 °C). Check that the temperature and respiratory monitoring is operational in preparation for animal placement on the animal bed.\nCheck the operation of the O2 and N2 flowmeters (for 0.5 L/min: O2 at 57.2 mg/min and N2 at 0.575 g/min) by powering on both with the compressed air source off and O2 and N2 sources on. To avoid the risk of damaging the flowmeters, do not turn them on without sufficient input pressure.\n Ensure that isoflurane vaporizer is sufficiently filled. Prior to imaging, start isoflurane anesthesia flow at 1-2% and 0.5 to 1 L/min.\nPrepare animal bed by ensuring that the anesthesia, respiratory pad, and heater systems are positioned securely and functional. For additional PET/MRI co-registration accuracy, fiducial markers (e.g., capillary tubes filled with radiotracer at a similar concentration as injected for imaging) may be attached to the animal bed within the field of view.\n3. Imaging workflow\nAfter all necessary equipment checks are completed, proceed to imaging as follows:",
    "Anesthetize the animal with isoflurane and insert tail vein catheter (28 G needle, PE-10 tubing less than 5 cm) filled with heparinized saline (0.5 ml heparin, 1,000 USP/ml, in 10 ml saline). Warming the animal and/or tail may improve catheter insertion accuracy. Optionally place a drop of cyanoacrylate adhesive on the site of insertion to secure the IV line.\nTransfer the animal to the prepared animal bed. Ensure that the animal’s head is secure, with upper incisors secured by the tooth bar and ear bars in place if being used.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to eyes to prevent drying. Insert rectal probe thermometer. Ensure that temperature and respiration readings are functional.\nDraw the radiotracer dose (around 600 µCi in 200 µl) to be injected into heparinized PE-10 tubing of appropriate length – approximately 3 m for PE-10 tubing and a volume of 200 µl. Connect one end of this tubing to the infusion pump syringe, and the other to the tail vein catheter line, taking care not to create punctures in the tubing.\nSlide the animal bed forward into the bore of the magnet, making sure not to disturb the positioning of the MRI coil and any lines or cables, especially the anesthesia tubing. Ensure that the center of the brain is aligned with the centers of the MRI coil, PET system, and MRI magnet.\nPerform tuning and matching of the MRI coil by rotating the adjustment knobs on the coil, minimizing impedance (check coil specifications) and frequency (300 MHz for 1H at 7 Tesla) mismatches by observing the display of the high power preamplifier.",
    "(MRI) After tuning and matching, acquire a scout image: select a RARE tripilot sequence and run the sequence from the Scan Control Window. Check positioning of the animal, repeating steps 3.5 and 3.6 as necessary. Reset shims to zero value.\n(MRI) Acquire a localized, point-resolved spectroscopic scan (PRESS) in a volume within the brain: Run a PRESS sequence (see Table 1)  in a rectangular volume with dimensions 3.9 mm × 6 mm × 9 mm. Check water line width using the CalcLineWidth macro command. If the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) value is acceptable (e.g., 0.2 ppm), continue to step 3.10. If not, proceed to step 3.9.\n(MRI) Acquire a field map: Run a FieldMap sequence (see Table 1). Use the resulting data for a multi-angle projection shim (MAPSHIM) by running the MAPSHIM macro command and selecting linear and second order (z2) local adjustments.  Repeat step 3.8.\n(MRI) Position the slice plan for the DWI scan (see Table 1): using the Geometry Editor, ensure that the acquisition FOV is positioned to acquire the desired volume of interest within the brain. If the resulting slice plan is aligned as desired, copy this slice plan in the Scan Control Window for all subsequent DWI scans. Begin acquisition.\n(PET) With the PET acquisition prepared and ready to begin, start the infusion pump. After the pre-determined delay in which saline from the catheter has been injected, begin the PET acquisition (see Table 1) in order to capture the entry of radiotracer. Monitor the count rate and look for gradual increase in counts indicative of a successful injection.",
    "After 10-15 min, initiate the hypoxic challenge concurrent with step 3.12. To initiate hypoxic challenge, turn off medical air flow and immediately power on O2 and N2 flowmeters with the predetermined settings to deliver 8% oxygen and 92% nitrogen, and reduce isoflurane to 0.8%. Do not power on flowmeters without input pressure.\n(MRI) At the same time as step 3.12, begin DWI acquisition prepared in step 3.10 (scan “H1”).\n(MRI) Begin DWI acquisition (scan “H2”), prepared in step 3.10, immediately after scan H1 is completed. End hypoxic challenge by powering off flowmeters, restoring medical air flow, and returning isoflurane concentration to a suitable value based on physiological monitoring.\n(MRI) Acquire a post-hypoxia DWI scan prepared in step 3.10. Turn off the infusion pump after this scan has completed.\n(MRI) Acquire anatomical images in the axial and sagittal planes. In the Scan Control Window – select the MSME sequence (see Table 1). Using the Geometry Editor, ensure that the acquisition FOV covers the brain.\nRemove animal, return to cage when ambulatory and monitor for signs of morbidity, euthanizing if necessary with administration of CO2 followed by cervical dislocation as a secondary method.\nSubscription Required.
