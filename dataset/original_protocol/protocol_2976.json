It is recommended to perform both AAV injection and optic fiber implantation in a single operation to avoid damage caused by a second operation and ensure accurate targeting of the AVPe.\nBilateral AAV microinjection into the AVPe (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2720-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

The blue point is the bregma (the zero points of the X and Y axes), while the white one is the zero point of Z-axis origin. Right, overhead view of drilling position.",
    "(O–R) Implant an optic fiber. Pinpoint the bregma with fiber tip (O). Fix the optical fiber in place using dental cement and curing light (P and Q). Stiff fixation of the fiber should be confirmed (R).\n(S) Warming the mouse after the surgery until recovery from anesthesia.\n(T) Cleaning solution for Hamilton syringe and needle.\nPrepare the surgical instruments (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nWash the Hamilton syringe (33G needle) with 70% EtOH first and then saline in this order three times each (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nCritical: Follow the order of washing because EtOH can deactivate the AAV.\nWithdraw AAV vectors into the syringe, which is set in the injection pump, taking care not to include bubbles inside it (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nAnesthetize Qrfp-iCre heterozygous mice with ventilated 1%–2% isoflurane for 5 min (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nAffix mice to a stereotaxic frame and turn the heat pad ON (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nCritical: It is harmful to mice if they are warmed too much by the heat pad. Set the temperature at 34°C–36°C and place a paper towel between the mouse and the pad. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nSanitize the head with 70% EtOH, cut the skin with scissors to expose the skull and apply Vaseline to the eyes for protection.\nDry the surface of the skull with a blower to make the position of bregma clear (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F).\nUse a small amount of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or 70% EtOH to remove the periosteum and clean the surface of the skull.\nAdjust the height of the nose clamp to set bregma and lambda at the same horizontal level.\nSimilarly, adjust the position of either ear bar to make the brain mediolaterally horizontal.",
    "Find the bregma with a stereoscopic microscope and mark the sites of injection and implantation on the skull (coordinates relative to the bregma: +0.38 mm AP, ±0.20 mm ML for viral injection, +0.38 mm AP, 0.00 mm ML for optic cannula implantation) (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]G–4I). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nSet the position of the needle tip to the bregma and move the syringe to the injection site (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]J).\nMake a hole with a drill according to the mark (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]K).\nNote: It is recommended not to break the dura when drilling.\nNote: Adding a small amount of sterile saline to the surface of the cerebral cortex at the injection site can help needles and fiber enter the brain tissue and reduce the damage to brain tissue.\nConfirm a flow of AAV from the needle tip before and then insert the needle into the brain (5.10 mm depth from the surface of the skull).\nPenetrate the dura with the needle and inject 0.15 μL AAV vector into the AVPe.\nNote: AAVs with titers of >1.0 × 1013 genome copies (gc)/mL usually yield good expression of opsins for optogenetics.\nCoordinates relative to the bregma: +0.38 mm AP, ±0.20 mm ML, −5.10 mm DV for adult mice in our study (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]L)\nSet injection speed at 0.1 μL/min or less (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]M).\nNote: There is a large individual variation in the sutures of the mouse skull, and the location of the bregma is often difficult to pinpoint (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]H and 4I). Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]N shows an example of the bregma and two injection sites (drill marks).\nWait for 5 min after the injection before removing the syringe to prevent the backflow of the injected virus.\nConfirm a flow of AAV from the needle tip again before the injection at the contralateral site of AVPe.",
    "Inject another 0.15 μL AAV vector into the contralateral AVPe. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nWipe the needle with 70% EtOH and paper to remove blood and tissue fluid.\nTo prevent the needle to be clogged by blood or tissue fluid, put the needle in saline in a 1.5 mL tube and infuse a small amount of AAV from the syringe (about 2 s at the same rate as an injection to the brain).\nCritical: When the needle is clogged by blood or tissue fluid interfering with the viral injection, replace the needle with a new one.\nRemove the injection pump from the stereotaxis stand.\nImplantation of optic fibers.\nSet a holder of optic cannula (200-μm diameter, NA:0.50, 6.0 mm long) to the stereotaxic mode.\nHold an optic cannula with the holder and set the position of the cannula tip to the bregma (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]O).\nMove the cannula to the implantation site and insert it into the brain (+0.38 mm AP, 0.00 mm ML, −4.80 mm DV).\nNote: Position of cannula tip is slightly above (usually 0.3 mm) the injection site.\nRemove fluid (blood, cerebrospinal fluid, etc.) from surface of the skull and fix the implanted optic cannula to the skull using dental cement (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]P).\nExpose UV-violet light to the dental cement for 10–20 s by using light-curing type cement (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]Q).\nNote: Do not look at the light directly.\nApply cement and light irradiation several times to secure the fiber tightly in place (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]R).\nNote: Screws or other anchors are not necessary.\nAfter the surgery, warm the mice to promote spontaneous recovery (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]S) and carefully wipe off the Vaseline from the eyes.\nOnce they begin to move spontaneously, place them in individual cages.\nWait for at least three weeks before subsequent experiments to allow for a sufficient recovery period.",
    "Note: Once the gene is adequately expressed, QIH can be induced repeatedly with a high reproducibility at least for 8 months after the surgery.\nCritical: Because the precise location of the injection and optic cannula implantation is critical for achieving proper manipulation of target neurons, optimize the coordinates of the injection site before conducting experiments. The optimized position may vary depending on factors such as the age of mice and type of stereotaxic frame used.\nWashing Hamilton syringe and 33G needle.\nWash the needle in the same order as in step 1b.\nPerform an additional wash using Hamilton™ Needle Cleaning Concentrate, which is diluted to 25% with water, 3 times (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]T).\nCritical: Clean properly the needle after use as described in step 1u and 10v, so that the needle can be reused. It can be used for approximately 10 surgeries (about 40 mice).\nTransmitter implantation into the abdominal cavity\nTiming: 15 min\nThis step describes the procedure for implanting the TA-F10 transmitter in the abdominal cavity to monitor the mouse core body temperature (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). If you intend to monitor only TBAT, skip this step.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2720-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. The main experimental steps of transmitter implantation\n(A) Tools for the implantation. Tape is used to fix the mouse limbs during surgery.\n(B) Surgical instruments used to cut the peritoneum should be carefully sterilized by an antiseptic solution.\n(C) Put a transmitter in saline until just before implantation.\n(D) Place the anesthetized mouse on the heat pad and fix the limbs with tape.\n(E) Make a 1.5 cm incision in the skin. Clean with saline and keep the tissue wet during the surgery. Eliminate the hair as much as possible.\n(F) Make a minimal incision in the transparent peritoneum, being careful not to cut the abdominal muscles.",
    "(G) Put a transmitter into the abdominal cavity.\n(H) Suture the peritoneum with sterile thread.\n(I) Suture the skin with a sterile thread.\n(J) Wipe the wound thoroughly and warm the mouse after the surgery until it recovers from anesthesia.\nImplantation of transmitters.\nPrepare the surgical instruments (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nCritical: Carefully sanitize the instruments used to cut the peritoneum before the surgery.\nPut the transmitters in HIBITANE® (diluted to 0.5% with water) in a 50 mL conical tube at least for 10 min (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B) and wash them with sterilized saline just before the implantation.\nSoak a transmitter (TA-F10) in saline until the implantation (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nAnesthetize a Qrfp-iCre heterozygous mouse that has received AAV injection and optic cannula implantation using 1–2% isoflurane via ventilation for 5 min.\nPosition the mouse on its back and fix its limbs to a heat pad using masking tape while maintaining inhalation of isoflurane (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D).\nThoroughly sanitize the skin around the stomach with 70% ethanol and sterilized saline.\nMake a small incision in the middle of the abdomen using scissors (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]E).\nNote: It is recommended not to shave the hair on the stomachs of mice because shaving may possibly aggravate wounds.\nMake a small incision in the peritoneum. An incision of approximately 1 cm is usually sufficient for the TA-F10 implantation (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]F). Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nCritical: Make sure to make an incision in the thin and transparent peritoneum. Avoid cutting the abdominal muscles; otherwise, bleeding may occur. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods Video S1. Transmitter implantation into the abdominal cavity, in reference to step 4h–k in ‘‘Transmitter implantation into the abdominal cavity”\n    \nPut a sensor in the abdominal cavity (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]G).",
    "Sew the peritoneum with 3–4 stitches using a sterilized suture needle and suture material (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]H).\nCritical: Proceed with this step as quickly as possible to prevent hypothermia in the mice during the operation.\nWash the peritoneum with saline to prevent it from drying out.\nNote: It is recommended to warm up the saline to approximately 30°C to avoid loss of body temperature.\nSew the skin using a sterilized suture needle and suture (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]I).\nCarefully wipe the blood with paper and keep the mouse warm until it moves spontaneously (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]J).\nPut the mouse into a warm recovery chamber for the early recovery and transfer the mouse to a clean individual cage and allow it to recover.\nNote: At least one week is required for the recovery period after the surgery.\nBody temperature recording and optogenetic manipulation\nTiming: hours to several days\nThis section describes the procedure for monitoring mouse TB and/or TBAT in free-moving mice subjected to QIH induced by optogenetics. For monitoring either TB or TBAT, you should acclimate the mouse to the recording chamber for at least 12 h and record them in a thermostatic chamber (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3E) to keep the ambient temperature stable. This step also describes optogenetics using OPN4dC. Since OPN4dC is a highly sensitive opsin, blue light exposure does not cause damage to the brain tissues even after stimulation for a long time (at least 24 h).\nTo precisely detect the TBAT and surface temperature of mice, remove the hair around the interscapular region before the experiment (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A–6D).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2720-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

    "(D) Examples of mice after removing the hair.\n(E) Attaching fiber patch cord.\n(F) Switch on the transmitter by the magnet and confirm by radio.\n(G) Put the mouse in the recording cage.\n(H) The setting of the pulse generator. For 24 h of continuous stimulation, the system is designed to deliver 24-pulse with a pulse width of 3600 s without interval.\nPrepare a hair clipper and hair removal cream (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nAnesthetize a mouse with ventilated 1–2% isoflurane for 2 min.\nCut the hair with the clipper and apply hair removal cream on the back (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nSpread it thoroughly with a cotton swab.\nAnesthetize the mouse again and wait for 1 min (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C).\nNote: Do not leave the cream on for more than one minute.\nRemove the cream carefully with a piece of paper moistened with warm water (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D).\nNote: Even when the hairs on the back are not incompletely removed since the hair follicles are often left behind (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D, right), it does not cause problems in experiments that end within a week.\nCritical: Remove hair on the back of mice just before the TBAT measurement, since the hair, especially of young mice, grows in a few days.\nSetting up of infrared sensor camera for TBAT measurement and optogenetics.\nStart InfReC software (InfReC Analyzer NS9500 Professional, Nippon Avionics) used to obtain and analyze images.\nTurn on the infrared thermographic camera at least 1 h before use for calibration.\nNote: To maximize the accuracy of measurements, keep the camera in a thermostatic chamber at all times (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nConfirm that the cage temperature detected by the camera is the same as the ambient temperature and stable.\nAdjust the power of the laser to an ideal range of 3–10 μW at the fiber tip (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]I).",
    "Note: The 3–10 μW laser is very weak, but it is visible in the dark.\nCritical: Provide the light to neurons continuously (not pulsed).\nConnect the optical fiber implanted in the mouse brain to the fiber patch cord (200-μm diameter, NA:0.57, 1m in our study) at least 1 h before the manipulation for the mouse to get habituated to it (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]E). Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: If you are also using the telemetry system, turn on a transmitter embedded in the mouse with a magnet (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]F), as described below (step 7).\nPut a mouse in a cage, above which the infrared camera is set (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]G).\nEnsure that the rotary joint allows the mouse to move freely.\nConfirm that the camera detects the temperature around the interscapular region, which should show the highest value in the mouse. The usual temperature of TBAT in mice is 35°C–38°C\nRecord infrared thermographic images at the desired acquisition rate.\nNote: The sampling rate of 0.5 Hz (1 frame per 2 seconds) is enough to track the mouse movements as well as changes in the body temperature.\nSetup PhysioTel telemetry system for TB measurement.\nStart up the PhysioTel system and open the software (PONEMAH Physiology Platform v.6.30) (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2720-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

    "Put an RPC-1 receiver board (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D) under the mouse cage and connect the board to the matrix with a LAN cable (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nEdit PhysioTel/HD(MX2) configuration (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B).\nRegister the “Hardware” (registration of transmitter TA-F10 and receiver RPC-1) (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]C), according to the PONEMAH manual.\nRegister the “Experiment Setup” and “Subject Setup” (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]D).\nTurn on the power of the transmitter embedded in the mouse with a magnet (same as in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]F).\nUse a radio (AM52) to check whether the transmitter is actually on.\nStart acquiring data and confirm that the value of the body temperature detected by the TA-F10 is stable (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]E). Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: TA-F10 can measure the mouse locomotor activity as well as temperature.\nRecord parameters at desired acquisition rate.\nNote: The sampling rate at 0.1 Hz (once in 10 s) is sufficient, but it depends on the grade of the matrix and the number of mice.\nOptogenetic manipulation.\nSet the stimulation condition with TTL pulse generator (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]H).\nApply the blue light stimulation continuously.\nData analysis of TBAT and TB.\nMonitor the body temperatures (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]E). Troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: In the acquisition mode, thermal images show the highest value within the recording area. The highest value usually indicates the mouse BAT temperature.\nOnce data acquisition by the thermal camera is completed and data is saved, you can analyze data using official InfReC software (InfReC Analyzer NS9500 Standard, Nippon Avionics) (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]F, Methods Videos S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2], S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3], and S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).
