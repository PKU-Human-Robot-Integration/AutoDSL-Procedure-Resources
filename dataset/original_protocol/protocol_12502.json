    "1. Lentivirus Preparation\nGrow HEK-293FT cells to 90% confluence.\nOn the day of transfection change cell medium to serum-free DMEM supplemented with 1 mM glutamine and 50 mg/ml penicillin-streptomycin.\nCo-transfect the cells with a pLKO.1-Puro vector and with plasmids coding for the delta R8.2 and VSV-G moieties and the miRNA of interest, using 10 μl of 1 mg/ml polyethylenimine as a carrier 9.\nCollect packaged lentiviruses at 24 hr and 48 hr post-transfection, filter through 0.45 μm filter.\nConcentrate the lentiviruses using ultracentrifugation in 70,000 x g, for 2 hr and 15 °C, aliquot and store at -70 °C.\nMeasure virus titer by infecting HEK-293T cells with serially diluted virus preparations (1 to 10-6 ml of vector per well). The resulting titer (a minimum of ~1×109 infectious particles per ml is recommended) is evaluated for expression of the gene of interest, using puromycin selection and by quantifying GFP expressing viruses through counting fluorescent cells.\nFor more detailed protocol of lentivirus preparation see 10.\n2. Preparing Animals for Surgery\nSurgeons garb should include surgical gown, sterile gloves, cap and mask.\nWeigh the animal, then anesthetize it with an IP-injection of a Ketamine mixture, with the volume proportional to the animal weight as specified for each drug. For a Ketamine/Xylazine mixture, a dose range of 80-200 mg/kg Ketamine and 7-20 mg/kg Xylazine is usually used for mice.\nWait until the animal is fully anesthetized, then check for lack of withdrawal reflex in the hind limb of the animal by extending the limb and then pressing it with your finger.\nInject the animal subcutaneously with Rimadyl, as specified on the box, for pain relief. Typical dose range for Rymadil is 5-10 mg.\nPlace the animal on a heating pad to keep a steady body temperature and moisten the eyes with ointment.",
    "Shave the area between the two ears with a trimming machine.\nSanitize the skin with betadine.\n3. Exposure of the Skull and Drilling\nPlace the animal inside the stereotact by adjusting the rods into the crevices just anterior to the animal's ears.\nUse a scalpel to make an anterior-posterior incision of about 1.5 cm between the ears and keep it open with surgery clamps (serfines).\nClean the surface of the skull with a cotton swab until the intersection between the coronal suture and sagittal sutures; i.e. the bregma and the intersection between the coronal and lambdoid sutures; i.e. lambda, are visible.\nPoint the tip of the syringe, held by the stereotact, to the bregma point, at all three axes. Write down the coordinates. This point would be considered as the zero point in all three axes.\nLift the syringe in the vertical axis so that a planar movement would not scratch the skull and move the syringe head to the correct location. Hippocampal CA1 injections require the following coordinates relative to the bregma in mm: -2 at the anterior/posterior axis, ±1.8 at the lateral/medial axis and -1.5 at the dorsal/ventral axis.\nLower the tip of the syringe until it touches the skull and mark the spot with a marker. Remove the syringe back to avoid stabbing.\nDrill a shallow hole, only in the skull bone using a fine driller. Hold the driller steady so it would not continue to drill into the soft tissue underneath. You can prevent this by steadying one hand with the other and by drilling in short pulses.\n4. Injection of the Lentivirus\nWithdraw 0.5 ml of the concentrated lentivirus solution.",
    "Place the syringe above the hole and slowly lower it vertically until it reaches the surface of the skull. Continue to lower the syringe into the brain very slowly. At this step some bleeding might occur which does not necessarily indicate a failed penetration. If bleeding occurs mop it up with a cotton swab.\nSet the digital pump to 0.02 ml/min (0.5 μl would be injected in 25 min) and start infusion. Slow infusion allows for effective spreading of the virus into the tissue and prevents back flow. In some syringe types consider inserting the syringe for an extra depth of 0.5 mm before retreating to original coordinates and infusing.\nAfter infusion is completed wait for additional 5 min to allow the material to spread into the brain instead of retreating back into the canal formed by the syringe.\nRemove the syringe very slowly and watch for back flows. If a back flow is observed at this step, a fraction of the injected material was probably lost.\n5. Wound Sealing and Recovery\nSeal the wound with histoacryl. Be sure to avoid leaking of the histoacryl into the eyes.\nInject the animal intraperitoneally (IP) with 1 ml pre-heated saline, to avoid dehydration.\nPlace the animal in a recovery cage that is positioned on a heated pad. Watch the animal while it recovers for an additional hour.\nIn case of weight loss, inappetance, weakness/inability to obtain feed or water, moribund state or infection, euthanasia of the animal should be performed. Acceptable methods for euthanasia of rodents are barbiturates, inhalant anesthetics, CO2, CO, or potassium chloride in conjunction with general anesthesia.\nAfter 4 to 6 weeks, assess the animal's navigation memory is assessed in the Morris Water Maze.  The lentivirus will usually infect most cells within the injection sphere.",
    "6. Behavioral Assessment in the Morris Water Maze\nTrain the animals in the Morris Water Maze. For exact training and testing protocol see 11. After each trial, dry the animal with a dry towel, replace it in its cage and refresh the water in the tank.\nTest the animals in the Morris Water Maze for 3 consecutive days, 4 trials each day. Each day insert the animal into the maze in each of the 4 directions of the maze (north, south, east and west) in a changing order, for example day one: east-west-north-south, day two: west-south-north-east. Wipe the animals after each trial.\nDuring the test trials track the animal with a tracking system such as the Noldus tracking system.\nAfter the 12th test trial, insert the animal into the water tank without the platform for one minute. This would be used to analyze the searching strategy the animal is taking.\nAnalyze the data as suggested in 12.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
