    "The following BreEStim protocol could be applied for both finger flexor spasticity and neuropathic pain management. The main difference lies in surface electrode placement and adjustment of stimulation intensity. These differences are explained in detail for each application.\n1. Subject Preparation and Setup\nSeat the subject comfortably. Place the arms and hands comfortably on the treatment table.\nIdentify and localize the area of interest for surface electrode placement.\n\t\nFor spasticity management, palpate the muscle belly of finger extensors and confirm with electrical stimulation.\nFor pain management, locate acupuncture points of Neiguan and Weiguan on the forearm24 ipsilateral to the side of interest, e.g., amputation17, or on the side with more symptoms, e.g., SCI. Neiguan is located about 3-finger width above the wrist crease on the volar side and in the middle between medial and lateral boards of the forearm (i.e., distal 1/6 of the forearm)24 (Figure 3). Weiguan is the counterpart of Neiguan, located in the dorsal aspect of the forearm24.\nTrim each self-adhesive electrode to about a 2cm x 2cm square to provide focal and isolated electrical stimulation.\n\t\nFor spasticity management, place the cathode over the finger extensor muscle belly (Figure 4). Attach the anode to a site 1~2 cm distal to the cathode. Optimize the sites for the anode and cathode when eliciting the largest and isolated finger extension response with a minimal wrist response.\nFor pain management, place the cathode electrode on Neiguan, and the anode electrode on Weiguan.\nConnect surface electrodes to the electrical stimulator (Digitimer DS7A, UK, www.digitimer.com[href=http://www.digitimer.com]).\nPlace and secure facemask. Select the size of facemask carefully to fit individual's face to prevent air leakage and to provide comfort of wearing the mask (Figure 5).\nConnect facemask to a pneumotach system (Series 1110A, Hans Rodolph Inc; Kansas City, Missouri; http://www.rudolphkc.com[href=http://www.rudolphkc.com]).",
    "2. Instruction on Voluntary Breathing\nVoluntary breathing, particularly voluntary inhalation, plays a critical role in this intervention. Voluntary inhalation is defined as effortful deep and fast inhalation. Instruct the subject to take a single isolated deep breath, similar to routine deep breaths, but faster and stronger. There is no need to perform voluntary exhalation preceding forced inhalation in a breathing cycle. Allow the subject to have 8~10 practice trials to understand the instructions.\n3. Electrical Stimulation Settings\nSet a single electrical stimulus as a single square-wave pulse with 0.1ms duration. The intensity of electrical stimulation is different for different applications. Since a single electrical stimulus is delivered each time, there is no need to set frequency parameter.\nFor spasticity management, determine the intensity of electrical stimulation when 1) isolated finger extension responses are elicited with minimal involvement of wrist joint responses; 2) the highest level that the subject could tolerate. The absolute magnitude of stimulation intensity could be different for different subjects. Encourage the highest intensity that the subject could tolerate to achieve the best outcome.\nFor pain management, allow the subject to determine incremental changes of the stimulation intensity. The starting intensity is zero. The highest level is the maximal output of the stimulator or the level the subject could tolerate. However, explicitly instruct the subject that discomfort or painfulness, even \"aversiveness\" of electrical stimulation is part of treatment; therefore, encourage the subject to select the highest level that the subject could tolerate.\n4. Control of Electrical Stimulation\nWrite a customized LabView (National Instrument, Austin, TX) program to control delivery of electrical stimulation in two ways: BreEStim and EStim.\nBreathing-controlled electrical stimulation (BreEStim) (Figure 6):\n\t\nDetermine the peak airflow rate during voluntary inhalation, i.e., during the deepest and fast inhalation.",
    "Determine the threshold which is 40% peak airflow rate. Of note, set the threshold higher than the airflow rate during normal breathing to encourage deeper and faster voluntary breathing.\nThen set the trigger function. When the instantaneous airflow rate of an isolated voluntary inhalation reaches or beyond the threshold, the LabView program triggers and delivers a single electrical stimulus with preset duration and intensity16. Allow the subject to rest upon request.\nRandomly-triggered electrical stimulation (EStim):\n\t\nAllow the subject breathe normally without specific instructions on breathing.\nThe LabView program randomly delivers a single electrical stimulus with preset duration and intensity every 4 to 7 sec. Similarly, allow the subject to rest upon request.\n5. Dose of BreEStim\nIt is recommended that each session of treatment has 100 to 120 BreEStim stimuli. It lasts approximately 30-40 min.\n6. Recording and Monitoring\nMake sure there is no air leakage from the facemask, since voluntary inhalation plays an important role in this protocol.\nMonitor signs of hypoxemia and hyperventilation when the subject wears facemask. Allow rest at the subject's request for this purpose.\nRecord any side effect, tolerance of voluntary breathing via a face mask, and any psycho-social effects.\nFor pain management, record any reduction of pain, i.e., visual analogue scores (VAS) 57 and duration of the effect. Use the modified VAS (mVAS) to further quantify the effect of pain reduction, i.e., how much pain is reduced and how long it lasts (reduction Ã— hours). Also record the average intensity for each session, since the intensity of electrical stimulation varies during each session of treatment.\nFor spasticity management, record the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) value of the target muscle and other clinical measurements, including strength, sensation, and range of motion."
