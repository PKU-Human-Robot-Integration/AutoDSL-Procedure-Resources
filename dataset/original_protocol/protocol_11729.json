    "This study was performed with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of California Merced.\n1. Zebrafish crossing and embryo collection\nMaintain separate transgenic zebrafish lines containing either the TAEL transcriptional activator or the C120-controlled reporter gene to minimize spurious activation.\nCross 6-8 adult zebrafish from each line using standard methods9 to produce double transgenic embryos that contain both the TAEL and C120 components (Figure 1B).\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, both components can be expressed transiently through microinjection of mRNA or plasmid DNA using standard methods10.\nCollect embryos in Petri dishes containing egg water (60 µg/mL Instant Ocean sea salt dissolved in distilled water), with approximately 30 embryos per condition to be tested.\nPlace the dishes in a lightproof box or cover with aluminum foil to minimize unintended activation by ambient light (see Table 1).\n2. Global light induction\nUse a blue-light (465 nm) LED panel to deliver activating blue light to several embryos at once.\nPosition the LED panel relative to the Petri dishes containing embryos so that the actual power of light received by the embryos is approximately 1.5 mW/cm2 as measured by a light power and energy meter (Figure 2A).\nPulse the light at intervals of 1 h on/1 h off using a timer relay if illuminating for more than 3 h to reduce the risk of photodamage to the TAEL transcriptional activator5,8.\n\tNOTE: The exact duration of illumination may need to be optimized for specific applications. In this protocol, examples of illumination duration of 30 min, 1 h, 3 h, and 6 h are provided.\nRemove Petri dish lids to minimize light scattering from condensation.\nPlace Petri dishes containing control embryos in a lightproof box or cover with aluminum foil for dark controls.\n3. Quantitative assessment of induction by qRT-PCR",
    "Remove embryos from illumination after the desired activation duration.\nExtract total RNA from 30-50 light-activated and 30-50 dark embryos using an RNA isolation kit following the kit's instructions.\n\t\nTransfer embryos to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and remove excess egg water. Add lysis buffer and homogenize the embryos with a plastic pestle.\nTransfer the lysate to a kit-provided column and continue with the kit's instructions. Immediately proceed to step 3.3 or store purified RNA at -20 °C to -80 °C.\nUse 1 µg total RNA for cDNA synthesis using a cDNA synthesis kit following the kit's instructions.\n\t\nTake a thin-walled 0.2 mL PCR tube, add 1 µg of RNA to 4 µL of 5x cDNA reaction master mix (containing optimized buffer, oligo-dT and random primers, and dNTPs), 1 µL of 20x reverse transcriptase solution, and nuclease-free water to a total volume of 20 µL.\nPlace the tube in a thermocycler programmed as follows: 22 °C for 10 min, 42 °C for 30 min, 85 °C for 5 min, and then hold at 4 °C. Immediately proceed to step 3.4 or store cDNA at -20 °C.\nPrepare qPCR reactions containing SYBR green enzyme master mix, 5-fold diluted cDNA (step 3.3), and 325 nM of each primer for GFP.\n\tNOTE: Primers used in this protocol as follows. GFP forward: 5'-ACGACGGCAACTACAAGCACC-3'; GFP reverse: 5'-GTCCTCCTTGAAGTCGATGC-3'; ef1a forward 5'-CACGGTGACAACATGCTGGAG-3'; ef1a reverse: 5'-CAAGAAGAGTAGTACCGCTAGCAT-3').\nCarry out qPCR reactions in a real-time PCR machine.\n\tNOTE: PCR program: initial activation at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C.\nPerform a melt curve analysis once the PCR is completed to determine the reaction specificity. Perform three technical replicates for each sample.",
    "Calculate light-activated induction as fold change relative to embryos kept in the dark using the 2-ΔΔCt method11. Statistical significance can be determined with a statistics software package.\n4. Qualitative assessment of induction by fluorescence microscopy\nRemove the embryos from illumination after the desired duration of activation.\nImmobilize embryos for imaging in 3% methylcellulose containing 0.01% tricaine in glass depression slides.\nAcquire fluorescence and brightfield images on a fluorescent stereomicroscope connected to a digital camera using standard GFP filter settings. Use identical image acquisition settings for all samples.\nMerge brightfield and fluorescence images after the acquisition with image processing software.\nSubscription Required.
