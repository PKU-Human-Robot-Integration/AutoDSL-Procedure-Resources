    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Academic College Tel-Aviv-Yaffo.\n1. Animals\nUse pre-adolescent (i.e., 3 weeks old) Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) outbred male mice.\nRandomize mice to two equally sized stress group (UCMS vs. naïve). Use 15 mice per treatment group (e.g.: if there are 3 pharmacological treatment groups use 90 mice overall; 2 [UCMS vs. naïve] × 3 [treatments] × 15 [mice] = 90)\nHouse mice according to the stress group; namely, house naïve mice with naïve mice only, and house UCMS group mice with mice from the UCMS group only.\nHouse animals in standard home cages (30 × 15 × 14 cm; 5 mice per cage; each cage containing mice from all treatment groups [i.e., pharmacological treatment groups]; maintain mice in the same cage throughout the experiment, except when indicated otherwise).\nFill home cages with fresh sawdust (replaced twice a week) and add a piece of cotton wool for enrichment.\nHouse animals in the home cage for an acclimation period of one week. Allow ad libitum access to rodent chow and water (except during UCMS stressor applications).\nKeep a consistent 12 h light/dark cycle (except when indicated otherwise). During UCMS procedures maintain naïve mice in their home cage.\n2. UCMS\nDesignate a separate room in the lab, for the sole use of the UCMS protocol.\nDesign a 4-week stressor regimen in which each of the seven stressors (i.e., wet cage, dampened sawdust, tilted cage, empty cage, social stress, mice restraint and disruption of light/dark cycle) is utilized once a week, on a different day each week (for a possible design see Supplemental Table 1).\nFollowing 1 week of acclimation (see 1.6) initiate stressors application (ensure that mice are approximately 4 weeks old).",
    "Each day, before the stressor application, transfer the cages of the UCMS group from the housing room to the UCMS room.\nDuring stressor applications, block access to the rodent chow and water for the UCMS group (except during reversal of light/dark cycle).\n\tNOTE: This could be obtained by the replacement of the original cage lid (which contains food and water), to an empty cage lid.\nApply the following stressors according to the regimen designed earlier (see 2.2):\nWet cage\n\t\t\nPlace mice together with their home cage counterparts in an empty cage (i.e., cage without sawdust).\nFill the empty cage with water kept at 24 ± 1 °C to a depth of 1 cm (pour with caution to avoid direct water spillage on mice). Keep mice in the wet cage for 4 h.\nTransfer each mouse to a separate individual transient drying cage with a heat lamp above it, a heating pad under it and paper towel bedding. Place a thermometer in the transient cage to verify the temperature does not exceed 37 °C.\nKeep each mouse in the transient cage until it is dry and looks invigorated (approximately 10–15 min). Return mice to home cage with same counterparts.\nDampened sawdust\n\t\t\nPour water kept at 24 ± 1 °C to the home cage until the sawdust is moderately dampened (pour with caution to avoid direct water spillage on mice).\n\t\t\tNOTE: It is not necessary to use fresh sawdust before pouring the water.\nAfter 4 h, dry mice in transient cages as described in 2.6.1.3. Place mice with home cage counterparts in a sterile cage with fresh sawdust.\nTilted cage\n\t\t\nTilt cages at 45° against the wall for 4 h.\n\t\t\tNOTE: During this period, stressor mice remain in their home cage with their counterparts.\nEmpty cage",
    "Transfer mice, along with their specific home cage counterparts, from the home cage to an empty cage for 4 h.\nSocial stress\n\t\t\nTransfer mice, along with their specific home cage counterparts, from the home cage to a cage which was housed by a different group of mice for a period of at least 3 d prior to stressor application. Keep mice in the unfamiliar cage for 4 h.\n\t\t\tNOTE: To avoid uncertainty place a sticker on each cage to indicate mice origin cage.\nMice Restraint\n\t\t\nPlace each mouse separately in a clean mouse restrainer for 4 h. Return mice to home cage with same counterparts.\nDisruption of light/dark cycle\n\t\t\nTransfer mice, in their home cage with their specific counterparts, to the UCMS room. Keep the light on, for 24 consecutive h.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Only during this stressor mice will be allowed ad libitum access to rodent chow and water.\nFollowing stressor application, return cages of the UCMS group from the UCMS room to the housing room.\nDuring the 4 weeks of stress exposure, keep the naïve group in their home cages located in the housing room.\n\tNOTE: Naïve mice are not transferred to the UCMS rooms because exposure to other mice undergoing stress procedure could induce a stressogenic effect, even without direct exposure to the stressor89,90.\nMonitoring of Animals during UCMS\nDuring stressor applications (except during disruption of light/dark cycle) monitor mice every 30 min by an experienced experimenter. If an atypical distress (e.g., trembling, lethargy, lack of movement) is observed (special caution should be placed on potential hypothermia during 'wet cage' and 'dampened sawdust') relieve the mouse from the stressor immediately.",
    "Inspect each mouse daily for wounds or other physical or behavioral abnormalities. If such are inspected consult with the laboratory's veterinarian to decide whether the mouse should be excluded from the experiment.\nWeigh each mouse every 3 days. Robust reduction in body weight (i.e., >10% reduction from baseline weight or >15% reduction from last measured weight) must be reported to the laboratory's veterinarian and the mouse must be excluded from the experiment.\n3. Screening for Antidepressants\nOn the day following cessation of the UCMS protocol, start administration of putative therapeutic pharmacological agents (i.e., escitalopram [15 mg/kg; i.p.; 3 weeks; on administration per day]30,50, or novel herbal treatment [NHT; 30 mg/kg; i.p.; 3 weeks; one administration per day]30,50). \n\tNOTE: For doses of other drugs not included in this protocol see: flouxetine46, 47, 49, 89, 90, paroxetine51, imipramine35,41,42,43, desipramine18,44,45, maprotiline46,47, mianserin48, melatonin43,49, URB59754 and other natural compounds37,55,56,57,58. \n\tNOTE: NHT is an herbal formula that was developed in our lab. It is composed of 4 constituents:  \nCrataegus Pinnatifida, Triticum Aestivum, Lilium Brownie, and Fructus Zizyphi Jujube. The formula is prepared by dissolving the constituents (acquired as freeze-dried granules) together in saline containing 1% DMSO to give a final concentration of 0.47 mg/ml (each)27,50.\nInclude a control treatment group and administer saline (i.p.; 3 weeks; one injection per day) to this group.\nCalculate drug dose according to mice' weight, as obtained in the preceding weighing.\nAdminister drugs chronically (usually one drug administration per day via intraperitoneal injection [i.p.] for 3 weeks).\n\tNOTE: There is no need to anesthetize the mice before the i.p. injection.\nContinue to weigh mice every 3 d; the last weighing should be 3 d before the last drug administration.\n4. Assessment of Hedonic Tone in the SPT",
    "Following the treatment phase, remove each mouse from the home cage and place it individually in a cage filled with fresh sawdust and a piece of cotton wool for enrichment.\nPrepare two bottles, one with distilled water and another with 2% sucrose solution (other substance could be used: e.g., saccharin91, ethanol30).\n\tNOTE: Each bottle should contain the same volume of fluid. Neither prior acclimation nor habituation phases are needed before the introduction of fluids.\nWeigh the two bottles and set them at the cage lid to allow mice ad libitum access to both solutions for a period of (one of the following): 24/48/72/144 h.\nPlace the two bottles at both ends of the cage lid. Place rodent chow between the two bottles to allow ad libitum access to food.\nReplace bottles every 24 h, using sterile bottles with fresh fluid.\n\tNOTE: As mice are housed individually there is no need to change the sawdust even after 144 h92.\nSwitch nozzles' positions every 12 h (when test duration is 24 h) or once a day (when test duration exceeds 24 h) to counterbalance the possibility that the results were confounded by position preference.\nWeigh bottles each day to estimate consumption from each bottle.\nCalculate sucrose preference as theratio of sucrose intake from total fluid intake (i.e., sucrose/sucrose + water).\nSubscription Required.
