    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPre-operative care\nTiming: 5 min–1 h prior to surgery\nThis section explains how to prepare the animal for surgery.\nPre-anesthesia.\nWeigh the mouse to determine the dosage of pre-anesthetic drugs.\nSubcutaneously inject 0.1 mg/kg of buprenorphine with 0.1 mL of saline\nSurgery\nTiming: 45 min\nThis section explains how to implant a bipolar electrode in the MFB and fix to skull with dental cement (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3078-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Step by step guide to MFB implantation\n(A–S) Key steps of the MFB implantation surgery as referenced in the main text.\nPlace the mouse in the induction box with isoflurane set to 3%–4% and monitor until the animal is immobile and respiration slows down.\nRemove the mouse from the induction box, place it on the surgery table and secure it using the head clamp. Reduce isoflurane to 1.5%–1% or until breathing is stable and the mouse shows no reactions to tail or paw pinch.\nPower the heating mat at 37°C.\nShave the top of the mouse head using an electric razor (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nInject 100 μL of Lidocaine under the skull’s skin at the incision site.\nAntiseptic measures.\nApply betadine scrub.\nDry with sterile cotton bud.\nApply diluted betadine derm (1:10).\nRinse with saline.\nDry with sterile cotton bud.\nMake a circular incision of 1.5 cm in diameter on the top of the head using surgical scissors to uncover the top of the skull (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nScrape the periost with a scalpel. Remove any excess membrane with scissors.\nApply Vetbond to the skull near the edge of the incision and press down the skin to stick it to the skull. After this procedure, all the skin around the exposed skull should be glued. Wait 1 min for it to dry. (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).",
    "Apply one drop of green primer to the skull and rub it in with a cotton bud. This primer will optimize the adhesion of the superbond at later stages. Wait for 5 s and then rinse with saline. Wait 1 min for it to dry (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nClamp the electrode to the stereotaxic arm.\nCritical: Make sure that the electrode is vertical and not bent. Since the MFB is a deep region in the brain, this step is important to avoid implantation errors (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nCalibration for stereotaxis and localization of craniotomy if using a motorized device (NeuroStar):\nOpen the NeuroStar software.\nSet microdrive speed to 1 mm/s, 1 mm/s and 0.5 mm/s for x, y and z axis respectively.\nPerform frame calibration (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nSelect Calibrate for tilt and scaling.\nPosition the tip of the electrode at Bregma, and press Set Bregma in the software (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G).\nPosition the tip of the electrode at Lambda, and press Set Lambda in the software (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H).\nPress Go 2 mm left in the software and adjust electrode height to touch the skull at this position and click Set in the software (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I).\nRepeat for the right side (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]J).\nDefine the target for implantation: MFB Right : (AP, ML, DV) -1.4, 1.2, 4.8 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]K).\nUse the “Go to entry for target” function to send the device automatically to a site directly above the implantation site (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]L).\nSlowly go down until the tip of the electrode touches the skull.\nMark the point of contact using a marker pen and move the electrode tip out of the way.\nDrill the skull on the marked point using a .9 mm diameter steel drill tip. Remove any fragments of skull bone from the hole if necessary (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]M).",
    "Critical: If during the process of drilling the craniotomy, the skull may have moved, repeat the calibration steps (13). If the tilt of the skull has changed, given that the MFB is a deep region, it will change the final coordinates for implantation.\nIf using a motorized device use the “Go to entry for target” function to move the electrode above the entry size. Otherwise, move manually to above the entry site.\nLower the electrode and ensure that it does not touch any remaining bone fragments (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]N).\nSet the speed of the NeuroStar of the z-axis to 1 mm/min.\nClick on Use target -> MFB.\nClick on Go to target and wait for the probe to be fully lowered (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]O).\nPrepare a superbond mix using one dose of Universal powder, 4 drops of quick Monomer and one drop of Catalyst V. Make this preparation in a refrigerated vessel to avoid the mix drying too fast (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]P).\nCover the entire skull in superbond.\nCritical: Be careful not to touch the electrode during this procedure which could make it move. Make sure that the superbond covers it up to and including the lower third of the white plastic top, this will make sure that the plastic coated electrode cannot slip in the superbond and will make the implantation more robust.\nWait for the superbond to dry (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]Q).\nGlue the headpost to the superbond base using super glue.\nApply Ortho-Jet™ cement on the skull and the headpost. Wait for it to dry (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]R).\nUnclamp the electrode from the stereotaxic arm. Set the microdrive speed at 0.5 mm/s on the z-axis and go up a few millimeters so the holder can separate from the glued electrode. The electrode should not move at this step (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]S).",
    "Inject 1 mg/kg of Metacam diluted in .15 mL of saline subcutaneously.\nRemove the mouse from the surgery setup and return it to its cage.\nLeave the mouse’s cage on a heating pad until it is moving spontaneously.\nPost-surgery care\nTiming: 4 days\nThis section explains how to provide post-surgery care for the mouse.\nEvery day for 4 days, weigh the mouse to monitor its recovery and provide 1 mg/kg of metacam in drinking water for analgesia. If the mouse is weak and appears dehydrated, Metacam (Méloxicam) can be administered subcutaneously with saline to promote rehydration.\nHead fixation habituation\nTiming: 4 days\nThis section explains how to habituate the mice to being in head-fixation.\nEvery day for four days head-fixate the mouse in the body tube inside the setup that will be used for behavior. Start with a duration of 30 min and the increase in 30 min increments up to 2 h.\nVerification of MFB effectiveness\nTiming: 15–30 min\nThis step verifies that the MFB implantation was successful before proceeding to the learning of the specific report behavior (licking) to be used in the perceptual discrimination paradigm. During this step, animals receive MFB stimulation when they interact with an object and a well-implanted MFB will lead to an increase in time spent interacting with the object. (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3078-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Experimental setup for cotton assay\n(A) Schematic of the cotton assay. Interaction time with a cotton pellet is measured for 5 min without and then with 3V MFB stimulation every time the mouse was in contact with the cotton swab.\n(B) Setup for performing cotton assay.\nPre-conditioning session: estimation of basal interaction time.",
    "Plug in the MFB stimulation electrode to the stimulator with a wire that is suspended over a clean cage with a small piece of the cotton swab at the center of the cage (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nSet the Pulse Pal parameters (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nPlace the mouse in the cage.\nThe first time the mouse interacts (defined as contact with the front half of the body) with the cotton begin a 5-min timer.\nDuring these 5 min, time all interactions with the cotton swab.\nKeep a note of the pre-score: the total time spent interacting with the cotton swab.\nConditioning session: estimate the interaction time with MFB reward.\nPlace the piece of cotton swab back at the center of the cage.\nThe first time the mouse interacts with the cotton begin a 5-min timer.\nDuring these 5 min, time all interactions with the cotton.\nEvery time the mouse interacts with the cotton swab, deliver a 3V MFB stimulation without exceeding one stimulation every 2 s.\nKeep a note of the stimulation score: the total time spent interacting with the cotton.\nNote: During the conditioning session, a functional MFB will yield a very salient change in behavior as shown in Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] and quantified in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A: the mouse will bite the cotton tube and carry it around the cage, if it moves away it will return very quickly to it.\nIf the stimulation score is clearly larger than the pre-score and the behaviors described in the previous note were observed, the effectiveness of the stimulation is confirmed. The mouse can be included in the learning protocol with this initial voltage level. Otherwise, proceed to point (34).\nConditioning sessions with increasing voltage:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3078-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Experimental setup for cotton assay and head-fixed behavior",
    "(A) Interaction time with the cotton swab strongly increased in all mice, except those with non-functional MFB stimulation. (Wilcoxon signed rank test, pval = 4.3E-4, zval: -3.51, n = 16; error bars are quartiles).\n(B) Licking rates during the initial free-lick phase for mice with functional (blue, n = 8) and non-functional (red, n = 2) MFB stimulation. (error bars are +/- sem)\n(C) Example calibration curves for four mice with sigmoid fit are shown in red. The arrow indicates the voltage used for learning (Rsquared goodness of fit for a sigmoid function).\nRepeat step (32), while increasing voltage in 1V increments up to 4V maximum until signs of increased interaction are observed. When a clear increase is observed, the mouse can be included in the learning protocol with this initial voltage level.\nIf at 4V there is still no clear interaction increase, we recommend excluding the mouse from the protocol. It is likely that the MFB electrode was incorrectly implanted.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Video S1: Example mouse in cotton assay, related to step 31 and 32\n    \nTypical behaviour of a mouse with efficient MFB stimulation is show, note that the mouse frequently engages with the cotton bud\nLick behavior acquisition\nTiming: 30 min–1 h\nIn this step, mice learn to lick to obtain a rewarding MFB stimulation.\nPlace the mouse in the body tube with the lick tube placed close to its mouth.\nSet the voltage of MFB stimulation to the initial voltage established in the cotton assay.\nRun the conditioning protocol: every lick event is rewarded by an MFB stimulation without exceeding 1 stimulation per 2 s even if the mouse licks multiple times.",
    "Once the mouse is regularly receiving rewards without long pauses (as Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B), continue the protocol so that the mouse receives at least 500 stimulations.\nMFB calibration\nTiming: 30 min–1 h\nThis step allows obtaining calibration curves for MFB stimulation efficacy. This will establish which voltage level should be used for learning in subsequent tasks.\nPlace the mouse in the body tube with the lick tube placed close to its mouth.\nSet the voltage of MFB stimulation to the initial voltage established in the cotton assay.\nLaunch a calibration protocol.\nNote: The protocol lasts for 200 trials. Each trial consists of a 2 s long response window during which the mouse will receive a single stimulation if it licks at least once.\nRun the protocol once for each voltage starting with the initial voltage and descending in 0.5 V increments (ex : 3, 2.5, 2, 1.5, 1, 0.5, 0 V).\nScore the mouse’s performance by counting the proportion of response windows during which the mouse licked.\nNote: We suggest beginning the count after the 50th window to allow the mouse to adapt to the new stimulation level.\nPlot the percent of windows with a response as a function of voltage. The voltage to be used in future experiments is set to the minimal voltage evoking >90% of maximal responding (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C)."
