    "NOTE: In vitro generation of heart field-specific mouse cardiac progenitor cells (Figure 1).\n1. Maintenance of Mouse ESCs\nGrow mESCs (mESCsTbx1-Cre; Rosa-RFP; HCN4-GFP, mESCIsl1-RFP)25 on 0.1% (w/v) gelatin coated T25 flasks in 2i medium (870 mL of glascow minimum essential medium (GMEM), 100 mL of fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 mL of GlutaMAX, 10 mL of non-essential amino acids, 10 mL of sodium pyruvate, 3 μL of beta-mercaptoethanol, 20 μL of Lif (200 U/mL), 0.3 μM CHIR99021 and 0.1 μM PD0325901).\nWhen the cells reach 70-80% confluence, rinse the cells once with phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and then dissociate into single cells by adding 1 mL of Trypsin and incubating at 37 °C for 3 min.\nNeutralize Trypsin by adding 4 mL of 10% FBS in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM). Count the cells using an automated cell counter.\nCentrifuge ~3 x 105 cells for 3 min at 270 x g and room temperature.\nAspirate the supernatant, resuspend the cells in 5 mL of 2i medium and replate on 0.1% (w/v) gelatin coated T25 flasks for maintenance.\n2. Generation of Cardiac Progenitor Cells Using Cardiac Spheroids\nCentrifuge 2.5 x 106 cells from step 1.3 for 3 min at 270 x g and room temperature.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 25 mL of SFD medium (105 cells/mL). Depending on the scale of the experiment, mESC number can be adjusted accordingly.\nNOTE: SFD medium contains 715 mL of Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium (IMDM), 250 mL of Ham’s F12, 5 mL of N2-supplement, 10 mL of B27 minus Vitamin A, 5 mL of 10% (w/v) BSA (in PBS), 7.5 mL of GlutaMAX and 7.5 mL of Penicillin-Streptomycin. Add ascorbic acid (50 μg/mL) and 3.9 x 10-3% (v/v) of monothioglycerol prior to using.",
    "Plate the cell suspension into one 150 mm x 25 mm sterile plate and incubate at 37 °C in the 5% CO2 incubator for 48 h. Cardiac spheroids should be formed within 24 h.\nCollect all the formed cardiac spheroids and centrifuge for 3 min at 145 x g and room temperature to selectively isolate spheroids and avoid single cells.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the spheroids in 25 mL of SFD medium with 1 ng/mL of Activin A and 1.5 ng/mL of BMP4 for differentiation induction. Plate the spheroids in the same 150 mm x 25mm sterile plate and incubate them at 37 °C in the 5% CO2 incubator for 40 h.\nNOTE: Different concentrations of Activin A (0-3 ng/mL) and BMP4 (0.5-2 ng/mL) can be used for differentiation optimization depending on the mESC line.\nCollect all the cardiac spheroids and centrifuge for 3 min at 145 x g and room temperature.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the spheroids in 25 mL of SFD medium. Transfer the resuspended EBs in an ultra-low attachment 75 cm2 flask and incubate them at 37 °C in the 5% CO2 incubator for 48 h. \n3. Isolation of Heart Field Specific Cardiac Progenitor Cells Using Fluorescent Reporters\nCentrifuge cardiac spheroids at 145 x g and room temperature for 3min and aspirate the supernatant. Add 1 mL of Trypsin and incubate at 37 °C for 3 min. Mix well by pipetting to dissociate the cells.\nAdd 4 mL of 10% FBS in DMEM to inactivate Trypsin and mix well by pipetting. To remove the non-dissociated EBs, filter the mix using a 70 μm strainer and centrifuge the filtrated cells for 3 min at 270 x g and room temperature.",
    "To sort CPCs carrying fluorescent reporters (CPCs derived from mESCsTbx1-Cre; Rosa-RFP; HCN4-GFP), aspirate the supernatant and add 500 μL of FACS sorting solution (1% (v/v) FBS, 200 mM HEPES and 10 mM of EDTA in PBS) to resuspend.\nTo remove all cell clusters prior to sorting, filter the cells again using a 5 mL polystyrene round-bottom tube with a 40 μm cell strainer. Keep the cells on ice until sorting.\nSort the cells to isolate Tbx1-Cre; Rosa-RFP and HCN4-GFP positive CPCs using a fluorescent activated cell sorter (FACS). Collect the sorted cells in 1 mL of FBS. Keep the cell sample and sorted cells at 4 °C.\n4. Isolation of Heart Field Specific Cardiac Progenitor Cells Using Cxcr4 as a Cell Surface Protein Marker\nTo isolate first vs second heart field CPCs based on the expression of the surface protein receptor Cxcr4, use the mESCIsl1-RFP line. Aspirate the supernatant from step 3.3 and resuspend the single CPCs in 300 μL of 10% FBS in PBS containing 1:200 (vol/vol) PerCP-efluor 710 conjugated anti-Cxcr4 antibody.\nIncubate at room temperature for 5min and wash by adding 1-2 mL of cold PBS. Centrifuge the single CPCs for 3 min at 270 x g and room temperature and wash two more times followed by centrifugation.\nAspirate the supernatant and add 500 μL of FACS sorting solution to resuspend the single CPCs and filter as in step 3.4.\nIsolate Cxcr4+ and Cxcr4- cells using FACS. Collect the sorted cells in 1 mL of FBS. Keep the cell sample and sorted cells at 4 °C.\n5. Analysis of Isolated Heart Field Specific Cardiac Progenitor Cells",
    "Centrifuge sorted CPCs for 3 min at 270 x g and room temperature. Sorted cells can be used for gene and protein expression analyses or they can be recultured for analyses at later time points. \nTo re-culture isolated CPCs, aspirate the supernatant, resuspend the cells in SFD medium and replate ~3 x 104 cells per well of a 384-well plate coated with 0.1% (w/v) gelatin.  If increased cell death is noted after sorting, add 10 μM of Y-27632 (ROCK inhibitor) to the sample. Two days after reculture, spontaneous beating should be noted.\nTo analyze the ability of plated CPCs to differentiate to cardiomyocytes, collect the cells at day 12 of differentiation. Use Trypsin as described in steps 1.2-1.5 to isolate single CMs. Resuspend the cells in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) and incubate for 30 min at room temperature to fix the cells.\nCentrifuge the cells for 3 min at 895 x g, and room temperature. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in PBS to wash the PFA. Repeat this step once more.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 10% FBS in PBS. Incubate half of the cell sample with mouse anti-Troponin T antibody (1:500) and use the rest of the sample as a negative control. Incubate for 30 min at room temperature.\nWash the cells twice as described in step 5.4 using PBS. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend both cell samples in 10% FBS in PBS with 1:500 donkey anti-mouse IgG (H+L) secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 647 conjugate. Incubate for 30 min at room temperature.\nWash twice with PBS as in step 5.6. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 200 μL of PBS. Use a flow cytometer to analyze the cells.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
