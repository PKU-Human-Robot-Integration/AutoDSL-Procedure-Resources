    "The NCBI's CD-Search service (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi[href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi]; Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.90#cpbi90-fig-0002]) allows users to query a nucleotide or protein sequence against the CDD database via a sequence identifier or by pasting in the sequence in FASTA or raw text format. For the majority of queries provided as valid sequence identifiers, the default CD-Search settings display results of pre-computed RPS-BLAST searches (storing up to 500 hits each) that were run against the entire CDD database—including CDs curated by CDD staff along with additional sources from Pfam (Finn et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.90#cpbi90-bib-0003]), SMART (Letunic et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.90#cpbi90-bib-0008]), KOG (Tatusov et al., 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.90#cpbi90-bib-0014]), COG (Tatusov et al., 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.90#cpbi90-bib-0013]), PRotein K(c)lusters (PRK; Klimke et al., 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.90#cpbi90-bib-0007]) and TIGRFAMs (Haft et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.90#cpbi90-bib-0006])—at an E-value threshold of 0.01. The results are displayed by default in a concise format that shows the best-scoring domain model for each region of the query sequence plus the associated domain superfamily. If a region is annotated by a model that does not score well enough to be classified as a “specific hit,” only the superfamily annotation is shown. Default CD-Search parameters employ a score adjustment to address compositional bias, which largely abolishes the need to mask out low-complexity regions.

Then, open the Windows Command Processor (cmd.exe) and navigate to the project folder to run the command below to uncompress the downloaded file, which creates a folder named ncbi-blast-2.9.0+ in the project folder.\n         \ntar -zxf \"ncbi-blast-2.9.0+-x64-win64.tar.gz\"\nNavigate to the bin sun-folder in ncbi-blast-2.9.0+, and copy the executables rpsblast.exe and rpstblastn.exe to the project folder.",
    "3. Retrieve the rpsbproc executable by downloading the executable (rpsbproc-0.5.0-x64-win.zip) to the project folder from the NCBI CDD FTP site (https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/mmdb/cdd/rpsbproc/[href=https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/mmdb/cdd/rpsbproc/]). In the Windows Command Processor, navigate to the project folder and run the command below to uncompress the zip-file downloaded.\n         \ntar -zxf rpsbproc-0.5.0-x64-win.zip\nNow you have rpsbproc.exe and rpsbproc.exe.manifest files in the project folder.\n4. Create the search database for RPS-BLAST by downloading the preformatted search database (files) from the CDD FTP site (https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/mmdb/cdd/little_endian/[href=https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/mmdb/cdd/little_endian/]) to the folder named db under the project folder. Uncompress the files separately in the current db directory using the commands below:\n         \ntar -zxf Cdd_LE.tar.gz\ntar -zxf Cdd_NCBI_LE.tar.gz\ntar -zxf Cog_LE.tar.gz\ntar -zxf Kog_LE.tar.gz\ntar -zxf Pfam_LE.tar.gz\ntar -zxf Prk_LE.tar.gz\ntar -zxf Smart_LE.tar.gz\ntar -zxf Tigr_LE.tar.gz\n5. Create the data folder by downloading the domain-annotation files (listed below) from the CDD FTP site (https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/mmdb/cdd/[href=https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/mmdb/cdd/]) to the data folder.\n         \nbitscore_specific.txt\ncddannot.dat.gz\ncddannot_generic.dat.gz\ncddid.tbl.gz\ncdtrack.txt\nfamily_superfamily_links\nThe three files with “.gz” suffix can be unzipped with software such as 7-Zip in Windows. Make sure you choose “Extract here” to unzip the file into the current data folder.\n6. Put your FASTA file containing query sequences into the project folder. sequence.fasta was used in this example.\nAn example of how your folder contents should look is shown in Figure 19[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.90#cpbi90-fig-0019].\n7. Run RPS-BLAST by opening the Windows Command Processor (cmd.exe). Navigate to the project folder and run RPS-BLAST using the command below. Backslashes are used because this command is run on a Windows command processor.\n         \nrpsblast.exe -query sequence.fasta -db .\\db\\Cdd -evalue 0.01 -outfmt 11 -out sequence.asn\n8. Run the rpsbproc executable using the command below to annotate the results generated by RPS-BLAST.\n         \nrpsbproc.exe -i sequence.asn -o sequence.out -e 0.01 -m re",
    "9. View the results. The output file has a tab-delimited format and can be opened with WordPad, Excel, or similar editors.\nAn example of what your output file should look like is shown in Figure 20[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.90#cpbi90-fig-0020].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/868d9eb7-c5f3-4c6f-9129-00c21d298d31/cpbi90-fig-0020-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 20\nResults from running the rpsbproc utility on myosin sequences."
