    "NOTE: The experiments have been approved by the Animal Experiments Committee of the University Medical Center Utrecht and Utrecht University, The Netherlands. Furthermore, the animal experiments followed the Principles of laboratory animal care and refer to the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Mammals in Neuroscience and Behavioural Research.25\n1. Experimental Set-up\nNOTE: The standard mHB apparatus consists of a grey PVC experimental box (100 x 50 x 50 cm) separated from an additional compartment (50 x 50 x 50 cm) in which the group mates of the experimental animal can be placed during the testing period by a transparent, perforated partition1. If the presence of group mates is unwanted or if individually housed animals are tested, replace the transparent partition by a partition made of grey PVC (Figure 1; see also Ohl et al. (2001)1). The mHB (with different measurements) used for cognitive testing is described in section 5 of the protocol.\nPlace the board (60 x 20 x 0.5 cm; made of grey PVC) in the middle of the box.\n\tNOTE: The board can contain 20 cylinders (ᴓ 1.5 cm)14 staggered in two lines or 23 cylinders (ᴓ 3 cm)8 staggered in three lines.\nDivide the area around the board by black lines into 10 rectangles (20 x 15 cm) and 2 squares (20 x 20 cm).\nPosition a stage light above the board to create a larger contrast in light intensity between the board (representing an unprotected area comparable with the center of an open field or the light compartment of a light-dark transition test) and the box (protected area) in order to increase the aversive character of the board4,8.\nHouse the animals under a 12 hr reversed day-night cycle (e.g., lights off at 7:00 AM and lights on at 7:00 PM).",
    "NOTE: However, the mHB can also be used under the conventional light schedule (see discussion on potential shortcomings)1,6.\nPerform the behavioral testing in the most active phase of the animals (e.g., between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM)4,15.\nMaintain a habituation period of 2 weeks after arrival of the animals in the facilities. During this period have the same person performing the behavioral experiment handle the animals four times a week and include all handling procedures to be performed during actual testing. Handle the animals exclusively during the time of the day when the animals will be exposed to testing later on.\nRecord the experiments for data storage on video and in order to optimize the results and to reduce the inter observer variability, practice the behavioral scoring using a video recording of previous experiments2. Make sure to standardize all actions and procedures executed by the observer.\n2. Behavioral Testing – Without the Presence of Group Mates\nPerform behavioral testing in the room the animals are regularly housed in (to avoid possible effects of transportation to a testing location) and install all testing equipment before arrival of the animals in the facilities (to habituate the animals to the presence of the equipment).\nPick up the animal by the base of the tail from its home cage and directly place it in the mHB.\nPlace each animal in the apparatus in the same corner facing the wall (as indicated in Figure 1).\nAllow the animal to freely explore the mHB for a period of time (often 5 min1,6,16-18).\nHave an experienced observer live score the behavioral parameters using behavioral scoring software. Use the parameters listed in Table 1.",
    "NOTE: Some behavioral parameters (e.g., motor- and exploratory behavior) might be scored automatically as e.g., discussed by Henry et al. (2010)19 after necessary adjustment of the mHB.\nClean the apparatus with tap water and a paper towel after every trial in order to avoid a bias based on olfactory cues.\n\tNOTE: Possible testing-order effects when testing socially housed animals should be kept in mind17,20.\n3. Behavioral Testing – in the Presence of Group Mates\nIn the case of group housing, measure the interaction with the experimental animal and its cage mates during testing.\n\t\nPlace the group mates in the group compartment before testing of the experimental animal to allow for habituation (mainly 10-30 min1,12).\n\t\tNOTE: Testing under social-stress conditions is possible by placing a dominant cage-mate in the group compartment when testing a socially defeated individual13.\nPlace the experimental animal in the test compartment and allow it to freely explore the mHB as described in section 2.\n\t\tNOTE: Possible testing-order effects when testing socially housed animals should be kept in mind17,20.\nHave an experienced observer live score the behavioral parameters using behavioral scoring software. Use the parameters listed in Table 1.\nClean the apparatus with tap water and a paper towel after every trial in order to avoid a bias based on olfactory cues.\n4. Novel Object Recognition and Food Intake Inhibition\nFamiliarize the animals with an object (for instance a dice or a food pellet) in their home cage 2 days before the experiment.\nPlace the familiarized object in the apparatus 2 cm apart from a novel object (for instance a bolt or unfamiliar food) in the corner across from the starting point.\nMeasure the time the animal takes to approach the novel and familiar object/food. Use the parameters in Table 1.",
    "Clean the apparatus with tap water and a paper towel after every trial in order to avoid a bias based on olfactory cues.\n5. Cognitive Testing\nPlace a smaller board (35 x 22 x 1 cm) with 10 cylinders in the middle of the box (Figure 1) for testing rats3,22. Reduce the box in size to 50 x 50 cm for testing mice21 by inserting a partition made of grey PVC.\nScent all cylinders with a flavor animals are attracted to (e.g., vanilla) and bait all with a reward (e.g., a piece of almond, a highly palatable reward for mice and rats) beneath a grid so the animals cannot remove it.\nCue cylinders (often three) with a colored ring (contrasting with the grey PVC) and bait them with a removable reward (e.g., 0.05 g piece of almond).\nFamiliarize the animals with the reward daily in the 2 days before the experiment in their home cage by offering it with tweezers and making sure that the animals eat it.\nHave an experienced observer live score the behavioral parameters using behavioral scoring software. Measure the parameters listed in Table 2 in addition to the behavioral parameters mentioned in section 2 (Table 1) with the exception of the parameters related to object recognition or food intake inhibition.\nStage 1: With each animal, perform four trials daily with a constant inter-trial interval (e.g., 30-60 min) until a constant time to finish a trial is reached (i.e., when all three almond pieces have been collected).\nStage 2: Cue and bait three different cylinders and place the animals in the setup for four trials to test the reversal learning ability.\nClean the apparatus with tap water and a paper towel after every trial in order to avoid a bias based on olfactory cues."
