    "Surgeons are using an FDA-approved REBOA device in trauma patients when it is medically necessary. These data were reviewed by the IRB committee of Grant Medical Center/OhioHealth and were determined to be exempt from human subjects' research. Since no patient information is obtained, written consent from the patients is not required. See the Table of Materials for details about the materials and equipment used in this protocol.\n1. Common femoral arterial access\nLocate the common femoral artery (CFA) using percutaneous landmarks and ultrasound guidance12.\n\t\nLook for one or more of the following signs in the patient: i) systolic blood pressure (SBP) <90 mmHg; ii) transient or non-responder to transfusion; iii) profound refractory shock; iv) out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation.\n\t\t​NOTE: Establishing CFA access also allows for quick upsizing if occlusion becomes necessary, reducing the time it takes to achieve aortic occlusion13,14.\nFor safe arterial access, use the modified Seldinger technique: use a needle to puncture the ventral arterial wall of the CFA at a 45° angle. Insert a compatible guidewire through the needle into the artery and remove the needle. Place the 4 Fr sheath with dilator firmly in place over the wire and into the artery. Remove the wire and dilator, leaving the sheath in place15.\nTransduce the CFA arterial line, verify the waveform, and transduce the pressure to confirm arterial placement.\n2. REBOA procedure\nWhen REBOA is indicated, have the team prepare the second arterial line. Label one arterial line Proximal and the other arterial line Distal.\n\tNOTE: Dual channel arterial lines help guide resuscitation and optimize partial occlusion (Figure 1).\n\t\nIdentify that REBOA is needed when any of the following conditions are met.",
    "Look for patients with penetrating or blunt injury who are hypotensive (SBP < 90) and do not respond sufficiently to initial resuscitation with 1 or 2 units of whole blood (or 1:1:1 component therapy) in the trauma bay.\nLook for patients with non-traumatic hemorrhage who are profoundly hypotensive and require blood transfusion to maintain SBP > 90.\nLook for patients who are in arrest but are not beyond salvage according to ATLS guidelines for patients in hypovolemic cardiac arrest1.\nUsing Seldinger technique with an 0.035 inch wire, upsize to a compatible 7 French sheath.\nPrepare the catheter according to the manufacturer's instructions:\n\t\nUsing a 30 mL syringe with normal saline, prime the safety valve while leaving the orange peel-away in place.\n\t\tNOTE: It is not necessary to inspect the balloon prior to insertion as all balloons are tested during the manufacturing process. Readvancement of the peel-away over the balloon for insertion is difficult and creates unnecessary, time-consuming steps to reassemble the device.\nPull the vacuum to evacuate the air and close the stopcock.\nAdvance the orange peel-away to straighten and cover atraumatic P-tip for insertion.\nConnect the proximal arterial line to the ART port on the device (Figure 2) and flush. Connect the distal arterial line to the side arm of the sheath.\nPerform REBOA\n\t\nInsert the orange peel-away into the hemostasis valve on sheath ~5 mm until it stops, and advance the dedicated partial occlusion catheter to the desired aortic zone using the zone markers and measurements on the catheter.\nRemove the orange peel-away from the hemostasis valve.\nFlush both arterial lines after placement of the catheter.",
    "If available, use imaging, such as x-ray or fluoroscopy, to confirm placement of the balloon prior to inflation. Use radiopaque markers integrated into the catheter on either end of the balloon as references for placement.\nUsing the patient's physiological response as a guide, slowly inflate the balloon with saline using a 30 mL syringe. Inflate to support a proximal systolic blood pressure target of 100-130 mmHg.\n\t\t\nTo perform partial REBOA, verify the presence of pulsatile flow on the distal arterial waveform measured from the sheath to ensure partial occlusion.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Non-pulsatile flow indicates complete aortic occlusion is being performed, even if the SBP is non-zero. Titration of distal pressure is a secondary consideration when performing partial occlusion, with a target SBP of 20-50 mmHg when possible.\nIf complete occlusion is required, continue inflating until non-pulsatile flow is observed on the distal arterial line.\nSecure the device near the sheath with the securement clip.\nProvide definitive hemorrhage control.\n\t\nIdentify and control the source of hemorrhage using appropriate surgical techniques and imaging when clinically indicated. Use clinical judgment to determine the value and risks of additional imaging.\n\t\tNOTE: Contrast-enhanced imaging is feasible while leaving the balloon at partial occlusion to maintain hemodynamic stability while allowing blood and contrast flow past the balloon16 (shown in Video 1). Imaging is associated with a 47% increase in survival at 24 h and a 65% increase in survival at 28 days, despite longer time to initiate surgical hemostasis17.\nMonitor the patient's vital signs throughout the procedure.\n\t\tNOTE: If a radial arterial line is obtained in the operating room, the SBP will likely be higher than the integrated central aortic pressure monitoring from the catheter due to pulse pressure amplification18.\nObtain laboratory measures as clinically indicated, including blood gas analysis.",
    "NOTE: Do not draw blood from the arterial port on the catheter as the catheter's length requires a large flush volume and may clot if not completely flushed after a blood draw.\nRemove REBOA.\n\t\nDeflate the balloon slowly and monitor the patient's response.\n\t\tNOTE: Gradual deflation facilitates an improved transition to reperfusion.\nIf needed, advance a guidewire through the catheter and leave it in place for additional procedures such as endovascular coils for hemorrhage control.\n\t\tNOTE: A guidewire in the catheter is incompatible with pressure monitoring.\nDeflate the balloon using a 30 mL syringe and pull a strong vacuum to ensure complete evacuation of balloon volume; then close the stopcock. Remove the catheter and begin rotating at the 20 cm mark to wrap the balloon around the catheter shaft so it fits through the sheath more easily.\n\t\t\nDo not use excessive force to remove the catheter through the sheath. If resistance is encountered, readvance the catheter to a safe zone of occlusion and reinflate briefly to redistribute the balloon material. Perform the previous removal step again, ensuring a strong vacuum and frequent twisting upon removal.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: This balloon has more surface area than previous balloons due to the flow channels, so the fit through the sheath will be tighter.\n3. Post-REBOA sheath management and removal\nRemove the sheath as soon as possible following the occlusion procedure.\n\tNOTE: If there is no plan for subsequent procedure(s) with the 7 French sheath or an emergent care requirement that must be completed as soon as possible, proceed with removal of the sheath. If it is necessary to leave the sheath in place, the sheath must be managed until it is removed.\nSheath management",
    "While the sheath is in place, transduce and infuse it with crystalloid or flush it regularly to minimize the risk of thrombosis.\nConduct hourly vascular checks to assess bilateral pulses; consider Doppler ultrasound and ankle-brachial index measurements19.\n\t\tNOTE: If the patient is transferred, ensure sheath management is handed over and discuss who will remove the sheath.\nSheath removal\n\t\nAssess coagulopathy using conventional coagulation assays such as prothrombin time, or viscoelastic assays, including thrombelastography (TEG) and rotational thrombelastometry (ROTEM)20.\n\t\tNOTE: If the patient is coagulopathic, consider reversing coagulopathy prior to sheath removal or surgical repair of the arteriotomy after sheath removal.\nCheck bilateral lower extremity pulses to verify full and equal pulses.\n\t\tNOTE: If diminished pulse is noted, notify the attending trauma surgeon, and consider duplex ultrasound or CT angiogram to determine the best course of action to restore function.\nRemove the sheath and close by direct pressure for 30 min or use a closure device per institution policy and physician preference. Ensure the patient is placed on bedrest with affected leg straight for 6 h following sheath removal.\nPerform regular monitoring of the access site21: visualize the site, assess neurovascular function, and monitor vascular function with distal pulse checks and Doppler ultrasound. Monitor the patient every hour for 4 h, and then every 6 h for the next 24 h. If diminished vascular or neurovascular function is noted during any of these checks, immediately notify the attending trauma surgeon, and consider duplex ultrasound or CT angiogram to determine the best course of action to restore function.\n\t\tNOTE: Consider duplex ultrasound 24 h after sheath removal to proactively assess vascular function after sheath removal."
