    "Principal scheme of the experiment is shown in Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160315/20160315211712_0207.jpgFigure 2. Scheme of the experiment Seeds of maize (Zea mays L.) were sterilized in 5% (w/w) solution of NaOCl for 10 min then were washed twice in water. Seeds were placed in the cells of plastic grid that was mounted in a tray with water. Plants were grown in the dark in a thermostat at 27 °C for 96 h. While any part of etiolated seedling can be used for the assay, we have used five zones (meristem, early elongation, elongation, late elongation, post-elongation) of primary roots (Figure 1). The recommended amount of plant material in each sample is 30-40 mg. One mm of maize root represents approximately one mg of fresh weight. Thus, root pieces of 10 mm length from three or four seedlings or pieces of 1-mm length from 30-40 seedlings are enough for one replica.30-40 mg of fresh plant material was homogenized with mortar and pestle on ice in 1 ml of 50 mM NaOAc buffer (pH 6.0) with 3 mM of dithiothreitol to prevent the intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide bonds formation and with 0.03% (w/w) NaN3 to restrict bacterial contamination. Homogenate was transferred to microcentrifuge tube (1.5-2 ml). Homogenates that were already prepared could be stored in refrigerator (-20 °C) while other samples are being done.1 ml of suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 x g. Then 100 μl of supernatant were separated for further estimation of protein content according to Bradford (1976) (step 9) and free arabinose content estimation (step 10). Supernatants could be stored in refrigerator (-20 °C). Steps 9-10 could be carried out later. The arabinose and protein contents do not change if samples are frozen. Pellet was resuspended in the remaining 900 μl of buffer solution using Vortex.",
    "Plant material was not separated from supernatant because of the potential presence of wall-associated arabinofuranosidases that might be not extracted by the buffer solution. The suspension was divided into two equal parts (450 μl each) that were transferred to plastic tubes as control and trial variants of each sample.50 μl of 10 mM 4NPA in 0.03% (w/w) NaN3 was added to the trial tubes, and 50 μl of 0.03% (w/w) NaN3 to the control tubes. Both of the variants were incubated in the thermoshaker at 600 rpm at 37 °C for 2 h. During that time cell wall arabinofuranosidases (either soluble or wall-associated) in trial tubes removed arabinose residues from 4NPA molecules producing yellow-colored NP. Enzymes in control tubes had no chromogenic substrate for reaction.The reaction was stopped by the addition of 500 μl of 1 M Na2CO3 both to the control and to the trial tubes. The coloration of the solution has become more pronounced at that moment due to increased pH (11.5).Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 x g. Optical densities of both trial and control supernatants were measured on a spectrophotometer at wavelength 405 nm. The control mean was subtracted from the trial mean. The result was used for the determination of the amount of liberated NP according to calibration.Calibration measurements were done for NP solutions with concentrations in a range from 0.0025 mM to 0.25 mM (Figure 3). 500 μl of 1 M Na2CO3 were added to 500 μl of each NP solution, because it enhances the coloration.Determination of protein content. 490 μl of water was added to 10 μl aliquots of supernatant from step 3 of each sample. 500 μl of Bradford dye reagent was also added to each microcentrifuge tube and then mixed using vortex.",
    "After 5 min each sample was read on a spectrophotometer at 595 nm.Determination of free arabinose content. 90 μl of water waw added to 10 μl aliquots of supernatant from step 3 of each sample.25 μl of obtained solution was directly injected to the column of HPAEC system without any pretreatment.15 mM NaOH (buffer A) and 1 M NaOAc in 0.1 M NaOH (buffer B) were used as eluents. The column temperature was maintained at 30 °C, and the elution rate was 1 ml/min. The gradient elution was performed as follows: 0-20 min-100% A; 20-21 min-linear gradient until the A/B ratio = 90:10(%); 21-31 min-linear gradient until the A/B ratio = 70:30(%); 31-32 min-linear gradient until the A/B ratio 0:100(%); 32-42 min-100% B; 42-43 min-until the A/B ratio = 100:0(%). Column was equilibrated with eluent 100% A for 30 min. Arabinose content was determined by the area of corresponding peak using the PeakNet software and the calibration for arabinose standard. Calibration for free arabinose was done using solutions with concentrations in a range 2-10 μg/ml.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160315/20160315212214_6300.jpgFigure 3. Calibration for different nitrophenol (NP) concentrations. Do not confuse the concentration and the amount of NP matter in reaction volume (see Table 1)."
