Preparation of compartmentalized microdevicesMix 2 g of PDMS base 10:1 with curing agent in a 50 mL Falcon tube by pipetting for 1 min and apply uniformly across the silicon master mould. Avoid introducing air bubbles during mixing.Degas in a 4.7 L vacuum chamber at 800 psi for 20 min.Cure at 80 °C in the oven for 2 h.Carefully peel the PDMS wafer using blunt forceps and place into a sterile 15 cm2 tissue culture dish microchannel side down to prevent debris from accumulating inside them.Use a scalpel to cut wafer into desired arrays (2 × 3 or 3 × 3 device arrays work well for a 35 mm dish).Apply 0.5 μL of the UV-curable polymer NOA-73 to a plastic bottom 35 mm dish and spread evenly using a cell scraper. Mark on the side of the dish the orientation of the final spread since myofibers align better along the same direction as the ridges in the polymer.Partially UV-cure at 55 J/cm2 for 10 s in a UV crosslinker.Caution: Partial curing is important to increase the viscosity of the resin while still retaining adhesiveness. If the UV exposure is too short, the resin will fill the microgrooves. If it is too long, the PDMS will not adhere to the dish.",
    "Transfer a 2 × 3 or 3 × 3 array onto the 35 mm dish ensuring that the long axis of the compartment follows the direction of the NOA-73 spread.Fully UV-cure the device at 55 J/cm2 for 1 min on each side.UV sterilize under UV lamp for 20 min.Apply 1 mL of 1:50 GFR matrigel in DMEM/F12 to the dish.Under a stereomicroscope placed in a tissue culture hood, use a fine pipette to remove air bubbles from each large compartment.Degas the microchannels in a vacuum chamber at 800 psi for 2 h.Use immediately or seal culture dish with parafilm and store at 4 °C for up to two weeks.Generating neural spheroids This protocol is designed to work with multiple human PSC differentiation protocols. The human PSC-motor neuron differentiation protocol used for this study is from Zhang and colleagues (Du et al., 2015) with additional magnetic-activated cell sorting purification steps outlined in (Machado et al., 2019). Astrocytes (ACs) were derived from mouse ESCs as described in (Machado et al., 2019). Other notable protocols for generating human PSC-motor neurons and astrocytes include (Julia et al., 2017; Canals et al., 2018; Fernandopulle et al., 2018). For the protocol used for these experiments, follow those outlined in (Harley et al., 2022). Consult the original protocol to determine the best point to dissociate and replate the motor neurons/astrocytes.To generate non-adherent 96-well plates neural spheroids, add 100 μL of 0.5% lipidure dissolved in 100% ethanol absolute to each well of a U-bottom 96-well plate.Leave plates near the air vents of the tissue culture hood with the lids ajar to dry overnight.The next day, dissociate motor neurons and astrocytes into single cells using TrypLE or accutase, respectively. For motor neuron dissociation choose a stage in the protocol that allows live cell sorting (Harley et al.",
    ", 2022) and replating into different culture formats; if motor neurons are too mature with large axonal projections, then dissociation will result in cell death. Astrocyte dissociation may require longer incubations (5–20 min) and addition of DNase-I to prevent cell clumping.Count the cells using a hemocytometer and plate 15,000 motor neurons and 5,000 astrocytes in each well of the lipidure plate. Calculate the quantity needed for a full plate and use a multichannel pipette. Plate into ADFNB medium. [Optional]: Combine ADFNB medium 50:50 with motor neuron medium. We have successfully used both medium conditions for human PSC-motor neuron spheroid formation.Briefly spin the plates at 1,200 rpm (290 × g) for 2 min.After 48 h, neural spheroids of uniform size and cell type composition should have formed. Check that the edges are well defined and the overall morphology is round (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4624/bioprotoc-13-05-4624-g002.jpgFigure 2. Examples of poor (A) and good quality (B) motor neuron (MN)/astrocyte (AC) spheroids. Scale bar = 50 μm.Plating neural spheroids into the compartmentalised microdevices (Figure 3) Thaw GFR matrigel, fibrinogen, and thrombin on ice. Place metal tube rack, metal block, and 35 mm dish on ice to cool.Make hydrogel mix containing 160 μL of fibrinogen, 40 μL of GFR matrigel, and 0.5 μL of CaCl2 (1 M stock) and leave on ice.Use a multichannel pipette to transfer neural spheroids from the U-bottom 96-well lipidure plates to a 10 cm dish containing 5 mL of ADFNB medium. Pipette up and down several times to dislodge the spheroids but do not be too vigorous as it risks breaking up the spheroids.Swirl the plate and transfer all the spheroids in 1 mL of medium to a 15 mL Falcon tube.",
    "Remove 950 μL of medium and add 50 μL of hydrogel mix so all the neural spheroids are in 100 μL of 50:50 medium to hydrogel.Transfer these spheroids to the pre-cooled 35 mm dish and leave on the cool metal block to prevent hydrogel polymerization.Remove GFR matrigel from the compartmentalised microdevices in the 35 mm dishes (from step A). Directly apply the aspirator to the PDMS array to remove medium from the chambers.Add 500 μL of ADFNB medium to the edge of the 35 mm dish to prevent drying. Ensure that this does not infiltrate the compartmentalised microdevice array.Using a fine pipette tip to transfer three neural spheroids to each outer chamber of the microdevice array under a sterile hood microscope.After completing the whole array, leave to rest for 5 min at RT.Add extra hydrogel mix to each chamber to ensure there is a meniscus of hydrogel above the PDMS array (this ensures that addition of thrombin does not disturb the neural spheroids).Now, add ~30 μL of thrombin across the compartmentalised PDMS array to convert fibrinogen to fibrin and initiate polymerisation. Do not add directly to the chambers; just apply at the corners. Do this relatively fast as the thrombin acts quickly to polymerise the hydrogel.Leave to rest at RT for 5 min.Now, carefully add 2 mL of ADFNB medium to the dish and place in the incubator.Plating myogenic progenitors into the compartmentalised microdevices (Figure 3) imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4624/bioprotoc-13-05-4624-g003.jpgFigure 3. Schematic outlining the different steps for plating human pluripotent stem cell (PSC)–neural spheroids and human PSC-myogenic progenitors into the compartmentalised microdevices. MN: motor neuron; AC: astrocyte; MPCs: myogenic progenitor cells; NMJ: neuromuscular junction.This protocol is designed to work with multiple human PSC-myogenic differentiation protocols. The one used for this study is from Pourquie and colleagues (Chal et al.",
    ", 2016), although similar results were also obtained using forward programming of human PSCs by forced expression of PAX7, as described in Rao et al. (2018) and Cheesbrough et al. (2022). Cells should be replated when they are at an equivalent progenitor/myoblast stage, before myotube fusion has occurred.After plating the neural spheroids, wait for 24 h before plating the myogenic progenitors. During this time, motor axons will grow through the microchannels into the central compartment.Thaw GFR matrigel, fibrinogen, and thrombin on ice. Place metal tube rack and metal block on ice to cool.Make hydrogel mix containing 160 μL of fibrinogen, 40 μL of GFR matrigel, and 0.5 μL of CaCl2 (1M stock) and leave on ice.Dissociate myogenic progenitors into single cells using TrypLE or accutase.Count cells and resuspend at a concentration of 20,000 cells/μL.Mix myogenic progenitor suspension with hydrogel mix 50:50, so that cells are now at a concentration of 10,000 cells/μL, and keep on ice.Remove medium from the edge of the 35 mm dish containing the neural spheroids plated in the outer compartments of the microdevice array.Add 500 μL of skeletal muscle growth medium to the edge of the 35 mm dish to prevent the neural spheroids in the compartments from drying. Ensure that the medium does not spill onto the microdevice array in the centre of the dish.Under the sterile hood microscope, use a fine pipette tip to remove residual medium from the empty central chambers of each microdevice.Now transfer ~1 μL of myogenic progenitor/hydrogel suspension to each central chamber.Leave to rest for 5 min.Top up with additional hydrogel mix to create a meniscus above the chamber and leave to rest for another 5 min.Carefully add ~30 μL of thrombin across the compartmentalised PDMS array. Do not add directly to the chambers; just apply at the corners.",
    "Do this relatively fast as the thrombin acts quickly to polymerise the hydrogel.Wait a further 5 min.Now, carefully add 2 mL of skeletal muscle cell growth medium to the dish and place in the incubator.Wait 24 h after plating the myogenic progenitors, then change the skeletal muscle cell growth medium to skeletal muscle secondary differentiation medium to induce the formation of a 3D sheet of myofibers in the central chamber.Maintenance and optogenetic entrainment (optional) of neuromuscular co-cultures (Figure 4) imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4624/bioprotoc-13-05-4624-g004.jpgFigure 4.

Error bars represent the SEM, unpaired non-parametric t-tests used to determine statistical significance. **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.The optogenetic entrainment section of the protocol is designed for neuromuscular co-cultures containing motor neurons harbouring an optogenetic actuator. In our studies, we used CHR2-YFP stably integrated into the human PSC lines with a PiggyBac transposition system (Harley et al., 2022). Furthermore, this section relies on the use of LED stimulator placed in a tissue culture incubator. In our work, we used a custom built stimulator (Machado et al., 2019), although commercial versions are also widely available.",
    "While optogenetic entrainment was not essential to generate functional neuromuscular circuits, it did significantly improve circuit formation and contractility and provides an interesting paradigm to investigate the activity dependence of synapse formation in future studies.Refresh skeletal muscle secondary differentiation medium every 2–3 days. [Optional]: Combine skeletal muscle secondary differentiation medium with motor neuron medium 50:50 at this stage onwards.Four days after plating the myogenic progenitors, motor axons should have begun to grow through the microchannels into the central muscle compartment.Before optogenetic entrainment, add 1:1,000 antioxidant supplement to the 35 mm dish.Place on top of the LED stimulator in the incubator and stimulate at 20 Hz for 1 h at 40% LED intensity.After stimulation, completely change the medium to remove toxic free radicals induced by photo-stimulation.Repeat this for five days.Note: The length of entrainment depends on the experimental conditions. We noticed that when treated with drugs that promote myofiber contractility, five days of entrainment would lead to too much detachment, so shorter entrainment periods were used (Paredes-Redondo et al., 2021).Recording and particle image velocimetry (PIV) analysis of optogenetic motor neuron–evoked myofiber contractions (Figures 4A–4D, 5, 6) imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4624/bioprotoc-13-05-4624-g005.jpgFigure 5.

    "Optogenetically evoked myofiber contractions in neuromuscular co-cultures containing motor neurons from ALS patient–derived TDP-43M337V PSCs compared to wildtype controls.To briefly test if neuromuscular circuits were functional during the course of the culture, an Olympus X73 microscope with a fluorescent lamp was used to optogenetically stimulate the motor neurons, simply by opening and closing the fluorescent shutter, and to observe associated myofiber contractions. However, for a more controlled analysis, a Thorlabs LED stimulator was used to provide precise optogenetic stimulation via an optical fibre light guide, measured to be 0.2 mW/mm2 of light intensity (Paredes-Redondo et al., 2021), which is sufficient to trigger action potentials in CHR2-expressing neurons.Place the optical fibre coupled with a 470 nm LED light guide >1 cm beneath the 35 mm dish, just out of frame of the microscope’s internal light beam.Set the LED intensity on the LED driver to 100% and the stimulation interval to 500 ms.Record 5 s videos at 20 frames per second (FPS) using the CellSens software; manually trigger the LED stimulator during the recording.Export video recordings as TIFF image sequences.Download and install the PIVLab Matlab plug-in.Load images as a time resolved sequence (A + B), (B + C), and (C + D).In PIV settings, select FTT in the PIV algorithm, Interrogation area = 64 pixels and Step = 32 in Pass 1, and Interrogation area of 32 px for Pass 2, 3, and 4.Calibrate the image to a reference image with a pattern of known dimensions (for example an image of a hemocytometer chamber taken with the same microscope and settings) and set the time calibration to the interval between pixels, which is 50 ms for a 20 FPS recording.Click: Analysis > ANALYZE!For post-processing, apply 8 to Standard deviation filter and Apply to all frames.",
    "Export results as text (ASCII) chart for all frames as area mean value using the velocity magnitude (m/s) parameter and draw the area of interest for extraction (the central myofiber compartment in this case).Finally, multiply the velocity magnitude values by 106 to derive the velocity magnitude in μm/s.Multiple recordings of the same conditions are combined by aligning the contractile peaks.Immunohistochemistry and analysis of axon outgrowth and NMJ number/morphology (Figures 4E, 7) imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4624/bioprotoc-13-05-4624-g007.jpgFigure 7.

Representative immunofluorescence images for Titin, TUBB3, SV2, and AChR alongside composite images and the colocalization channel for SV2 and AchR (Scale bar = 50 μm).Following contraction analysis, wash the neuromuscular co-cultures in PBS and fix for 20 min in 4% PFA, 15% sucrose solution.Wash three times in PBS; then, block in 3% BSA, 0.1% Triton-X-100, and 10% DMSO for 1 h at RT.Add primary antibodies (Titin 1:20, TUBB3 1:500, SV2 1:200, and AChR 1:100) in blocking solution and leave overnight at 4 °C.Wash three times in 0.1% PBT and incubate secondary antibodies (1:1,000 dilution) in 0.1% PBT, 10% DMSO overnight at 4 °C.Wash three times in PBS; then, mount using an 18 mm coverslip and vectashield antifade mounting medium. To mount the samples, add 3–4 drops of mounting medium to the edge of the array, tilt the dish so that the medium flows over the compartments, and then slowly drop the coverslip onto the array, starting with one side.Image using a confocal microscope over a 40 μm Z-stack at 2 μm intervals.Using IMARIS image analysis software, create a surface for each channel.",
    "Use the colocalization (Coloc) plug-in to generate a colocalization channel for the SV2 and AChR channels by using the automatic threshold calculation tool.Create a surface for this colocalization channel.Now, export object data for each channel, as well as morphology related data, such as area and volume.Use object number and mean area/volume data from the colocalization channel to infer NMJ number and morphology.Use sum area/volume data from the TUBB3 channel to infer axonal outgrowth."
