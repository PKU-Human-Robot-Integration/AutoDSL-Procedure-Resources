    "All procedures were performed in accordance with the Kumamoto University animal care guidelines (approval reference no. M30-040/A2020-105), which conform to the US National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (publication no. 85-23, revised 2011).\n1. Preparation\nPrepare the perfusion apparatus and vasodilator buffer (4 mg/L papaverine hydrochloride, 4 g/L; adenosine, 1 g/L; heparin, 1 U/mL in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)).\n\tNOTE: The reflux device and vasodilator reagents are the same as those reported by Weyers et al.5.\nConnect the 22 G catheter, 2 mL extension tube, and three-way stopcock (Figure 1A).\n\tNOTE: Adjust the gauge according to the size of the animal. For adult C57BL/6 mice, 22 G is optimal.\nFill the pressure perfusion apparatus with the vasodilator buffer (Figure 1A).\n\t​NOTE: Avoid the formation of bubbles to prevent disruption in the filling of the contrast medium.\n2. Perfusion\nInject 1 U/g heparin in PBS into the intraperitoneal cavity 30 min before the operation.\nCompletely anesthetize the mouse with isoflurane and euthanize it by cervical dislocation.\nAfter decapitation, make a midline incision in the sternum and fix the open thorax with pins.\n\tNOTE: To avoid leakage of the contrast, avoid injuring the diaphragm.\nCut the ascending aorta and remove the heart.\nRemove the lung and expose the descending aorta.\n\tNOTE: Do not injure the descending aorta.\nCut the descending aorta diagonally to expose the cross-section (Figure 1B).\n\tNOTE: Do not peel off the aorta; a diagonal section is better for catheter insertion.\nInsert the 22 G catheter into the descending aorta while running the vasodilation buffer.\n\tNOTE: Insertion of the catheter while running the vasodilation buffer avoids air contamination.\nPin the root of the catheter (Figure 1C).\nMake a knot to prevent leakage due to backflow.",
    "Perfuse a warmed vasodilating solution (papaverine hydrochloride, 4 g/L; adenosine, 1 g/L; heparin, 1 U/mL) for 3 min at a fixed pressure between 13 and 15 kPa.\nPerfuse a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde in (PBS) for 3 min.\n\tNOTE: The success of fixation can be confirmed by the movement of the foot (Figure 1D).\nPrepare the contrast medium just before perfusion.\n\tNOTE: Adjust the dilution rate according to the sample; for adult mice, mix the stain and diluent in a ratio of 1:1.\nStop the perfusion and fill the extension tube with 2 mL of diluted contrast medium (Figure 1E).\n\tNOTE: The contrast medium should be injected slowly to avoid injury to the blood vessels.\nPerfuse the contrast medium at a fixed pressure between 13 and 15 kPa.\n\t\nTo visualize arteries, check the toenail to confirm that the contrast medium has reached the artery (Figure 1F).\nTo visualize all vessels, check the inferior vena cava of the diaphragm to confirm complete circulation of the contrast medium.\n\t\tNOTE: In the beginning, the contrast contains the vasodilating solution; hence, its proper circulation is essential.\nClose the three-way stopcock and remove the tube (Figure 1G).\n\tNOTE: If the three-way stopcock is not closed, the contrast will flow backward.\nIncubate the sample overnight at 4 °C.\nRemove the skin and fix it in 10% formaldehyde solution.\n3. Visualization\nNOTE: Visualization protocols differ depending on the CT scanner. A microfocus X-ray CT scanner was used in this protocol. It is necessary to optimize the imaging method according to each CT scanner.\nFix the sample in a 50 mL tube containing PBS.\nPlace the sample tube on the table.\nScan the sample with a voltage of 50 kV and a current of 600 µA, ensuring a focus-to-center distance of 75.2 mm.",
    "NOTE: A dimension of 1 voxel was 28.7 µm x 28.7 µm x 28.7 µm in this setting.\nLoad the acquired image data with Fiji, an open-source platform for biological-image analysis.\nDetermine the muscle voxel value using the gastrocnemius muscle.\n\t\nChoose the gastrocnemius muscle by using the rectangle tool.\nCheck the mean and standard deviation (SD) from the histogram (Analyze | Histogram).\nDefine the muscle voxel density as mean + 2SD of the gastrocnemius muscle.\nSet the muscle voxel density as the lower threshold level (Image | adjust | Threshold | Set | lower threshold level).\n\tNOTE: The vascular area and bone area remain in the binarized data after the threshold is set."
