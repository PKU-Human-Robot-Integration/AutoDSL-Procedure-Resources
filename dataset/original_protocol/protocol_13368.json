    "The protocol was approved by the Michigan State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) (Protocol 2020-035, approved on 7/27/2020). For this study, 20 adult male sheep weighing 62 ± 7 kg were used.\n1. Preoperative steps\nFast the animal 12 h prior to surgery (overnight).\nPlace the animal in a sheep chair (Figure 1), and prepare for the right jugular vein cannulation using a long 11 Fr introducer sheath (sheath length = 10 cm).\nShave with clippers along the IV placement site-the right anterior aspect of the neck around 10-15 cm lateral from the midline for the right jugular vein.\nTurn the animal's head to the left so that the right anterior and lateral aspects of the neck are exposed. Localize the jugular vein course. To facilitate this, compress the bottom of the neck to distend the vein.\nClean with chlorhexidine and alcohol-based scrub, and anesthetize locally with 1% lidocaine.\nCanulate the jugular vein in the mid to upper third of the neck, as described.\n\t\nCut the skin above the vein with a number 11 blade perpendicular to the vein.\nCannulate with a 14 G angiocatheter; when in place (blood is coming out of the needle or blood is spotted), remove the needle, leave the catheter, pass the guidewire, remove the catheter, place the 11 Fr sheath, and secure it.\nEnsure the patency and proper placement of the cannula by withdrawing dark-red blood and performing a saline flush to confirm the flow and absence of swelling at the insertion site.\nStart the induction of propofol at 1.0-1.5 mg/kg intravenous (IV).",
    "Intubate with a number 9 endotracheal (ET) tube using a laryngoscope with a number 5 blade. For this, one person should secure the jaws and tongue, while the other person identifies the trachea, inserts the ET tube, and inflates the sealing cuff. Confirm proper placement by the bilateral breath sounds and condensation on the ET tube.\nAdminister intravenously the analgesic buprenorphine at 0.01 mg/kg and use 240 mg of gentamicin and 1 g of cefazolin for antibiotic prophylaxis.\nTransfer the animal from the sheep chair onto a surgical table, and position it on its right side.\n2. Surgery steps\nVentilate at 15 mL/kg (12-18 breaths/min), with oxygen flow at 4 L/min and isoflurane at 2.5%-4.0%. Confirm proper anesthesia to ensure the subject is at the surgical level (stage 3) by checking the jaw tone and eye rotation.\nLubricate both eyes by applying ophthalmic oinment and insert a gastric tube to ensure gas and food evacuation. Connect the electrocardiogram (EKG), pulse oximeter (SpO2), capnograph (ETCO2), and body temperature monitors. Attach the EKG limb leads (I, II, III) to the skin via alligator clips, the SpO2 sensor to the animal's cheek, and the ETCO2 tube to the endotracheal tube, and pass the temperature probe through the nostril into the nasopharynx.\nPrepare the operative field. Shave the left anterior thorax, clean with chlorhexidine and alcohol-based scrub, and cover with sterile drapes.\nMake a 10 cm long skin and subcutaneous incision at the level of the fourth intercostal space.\nConfirm the correct intercostal space by identifying the thoracic inlet and counting the intercostal spaces downward. Subsequently, continue the incision in the center and along the fourth intercostal space.",
    "Divide the intercostal muscles, open the chest cavity, and spread the ribs with a mini-thoracotomy Finochietto-style retractor. While performing the thoracotomy, take care not to injure the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) at the sternal border of the incision and the lung at the superior border.\nPerform baseline epicardial echocardiography to assess the biventricular function and valvular competence. The occurrence of non-standard views may be due to the mini-thoracotomy focused on the tricuspid valve (TV), right and left ventricular function, and pulmonary artery flow.\nIdentify the LIMA at the sternal border of the incision, remove the adjacent tissues around it, and prepare to establish an arterial line for pressure monitoring.\nPlace two 4-0 silk sutures around the artery, with one proximal and one distal to the cannulation site (used to secure the arterial catheter).\nUse titanium clips with a clip applier to clip the LIMA distal to the planned cannulation site to prevent backflow bleeding during cannulation.\nMake a perpendicular incision that is half of the circumference of the catheter in the LIMA with a number 11 blade.\nInsert an 18 G angiocatheter, and attach it to the arterial line module. When a pressure of around 120/80mmHg is reached, secure the catheter in place using the two 4-0 silk sutures placed earlier.\nPerform pericardiotomy starting at the level of pulmonary artery sinuses and going 4-5 cm laterally along the main pulmonary artery (MPA), taking care not to injure the left phrenic nerve.\nApply four to five retraction stitches to the opened pericardium to create a pericardial well, as this facilitates exposure and dissection between the pulmonary trunk and aorta.",
    "Dissect the MPA from ascending aorta (AA) around 2-3 cm from its origin using blunt right-angle forceps, starting at the level of the left atrial appendage and working toward the AA. To fully separate the MPA from the AA, use electrocautery or scissors to remove the connective tissue between the two structures.\nPass an umbilical tape around the MPA with a blunt right-angle clamp. Establish an MPA pressure line by placing a 5-0 monofilament purse-string suture 1 cm distal from the MPA sinuses.\nInsert a 20 G angiocatheter, and connect it to a monitoring line. Ensure correct MPA and arterial line readings are achieved prior to cinching the umbilical tape; the arterial and pulmonary pressures may vary but should be comparable to human patient values.\nHold both ends of the umbilical tape, and clip them together to reduce the lumen of the MPA.\nProgressively tighten the band with the successive application of a clip applier, with each clip placed below the previous clip until the systemic blood pressure begins to steadily decline (Figure 2). At this point, remove the last placed clip to stabilize the systemic blood pressure.\nWhen maximal cinching and stable hemodynamic conditions are achieved, secure the umbilical tape to the adventitia of the MPA using a 5-0 monofilament suture to avoid distal migration.\nPerform post-banding echocardiography to assess the biventricular function and valvular competence, as in step 2.7. Remove the MPA pressure line and arterial line, and ensure good hemostasis by checking for any bleeding coming from the area where the band and arterial lines were placed.",
    "Place a chest tube into the left thorax, with the entry site one intercostal space below the initial incision. Close the ribs with two Vicryl size 2 sutures, and close the wound with three-layer continuous sutures: Vicryl 2-0 for the muscle and subcutaneous tissues and Prolene 3-0 for the skin.\nWhen no signs of bleeding are seen, remove the chest tube before weaning the animal from the ventilator.\nWean the animal from the ventilator, extubate, move it to a single cage, and closely follow it for at least 1 h. Leave the central IV line in place, and secure it using a loosely applied bandage around the neck.\n\tNOTE: Postoperative intravenous analgesia was maintained with buprenorphine (0,05 mg/kg) and Flunixin (1.2 mg/kg) for 3 days post-surgery. \nSubscription Required.
