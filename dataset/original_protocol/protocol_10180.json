    "1. Preparing the 3D-printed Mold\nPrepare a CAD drawing of the mold in the desired dimensions.\nSend the CAD file to a high-resolution 3D printer. Select the appropriate plastic printing material, with glossy finish.\nAfter printing, thoroughly wash the mold with detergent and water.\n2. Casting PDMS Negatives\nMeasure the desired amount of PDMS base on a balance. For a mold with a 60 mm diameter and 2 mm well posts, use 25 g.\nAdd curing agent at a 1:10 (w/w) ratio to the PDMS base.\nStir vigorously until the two components are thoroughly combined. Insufficient mixing may result in incomplete curing of PDMS, resulting in a \"tacky\" surface.\nPlace a piece of laboratory tape around the border of 3D-printed molds, to enable the formation of a PDMS base layer above the printed wells.\nPour the PDMS mixture into the mold and place the mold into a vacuum chamber to de-gas until all bubbles are released.\nCure the PDMS at 50 °C for 2–4 h, or until solidified enough to remove.\nRemove the lab tape and carefully extract the PDMS negative.\nIncubate the PDMS at 60 °C for an additional 1 h (after removal from the 3D-printed mold) to ensure that mold is fully cured.\nWash the PDMS thoroughly with detergent and water to remove any residue. Insufficient washing may result in poor ring formation for the first uses of the PDMS negative.\n3. Fabricating Agarose Wells\nPrepare agarose wells 1 day prior to seeding cells.\nMake a 2% (w/v) agarose solution in DMEM and autoclave.\nPipet 4 mL molten agarose into an autoclaved PDMS negative. Then pipet agarose directly into the posts of PDMS negatives. Remove any air bubbles with a pipet tip, as bubbles may cause inhomogeneities in the well dimensions.",
    "NOTE: Do not overfill molds; the top surface of the agarose must be flat, so that agarose wells will be level upon removal from PDMS and placement into 6-well culture plates. Leftover agarose may be re-autoclaved and used again, although not more than once.\nAfter the agarose cools (approximately 10 min for 4 mL agarose; larger molds may need longer cooling times), carefully separate the agarose wells from the PDMS negatives using blunt forceps and transfer into a well of a 6-well plate.\nSubmerge the agarose wells in complete culture medium, and equilibrate overnight in a 37 °C incubator prior to use.\n4. Seeding Tissue Rings\nCulture rat aortic smooth muscle cells21 (RaSMCs) in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% L-glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids, 1% sodium pyruvate, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin until they reach 70% confluence.\n\tNOTE: Cells should be cultured at 5% CO2 and 37 °C in 15 cm tissue culture plates.\nAfter molds are equilibrated (section 3), prepare RaSMCs for seeding.\nRinse plates twice with 5 mL per plate of phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\nAdd 3 mL 0.25% trypsin per 15 cm Petri dish. Move the plates to a 37 °C incubator for 2–3 min, or until cells have lifted off the plate.\nNeutralize trypsin with an equal volume (3 mL per plate) of complete culture medium. Resuspend the cells thoroughly to break up clumps.\nDilute an aliquot of cell suspension 1:1 with trypan blue dye, and count the cells with a hemocytometer.\nCentrifuge the total volume of cell suspension for 5 min at 200 x g to pellet cells.\nResuspend cells at a concentration of 10 million cells per mL; this will result in 500,000 cells per 50 µL.\n\tNOTE: Different cell types may require different cell concentrations.",
    "Aspirate all medium from the agarose mold. Be careful to remove all medium from individual wells, but to not puncture the bottoms of the wells.\nPipet 50 µL of suspension into each well.\nCarefully add 2 mL of fresh medium around the outside of the agarose mold. Be careful not to let medium overflow into the wells of the agarose. Place plates in the incubator overnight (approximately 16 h).\nAfter overnight incubation, aspirate the medium from outside of the molds, and add 4.5 mL fresh medium to each well of the 6-well plate so that molds and rings are completely submerged. Change medium daily."
