    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIn vitro induction of trained immunity in adherent monocytes\nTiming: 7 days\nBefore starting: heat up the PBS at 37°C (warm PBS). Complete RPMI 1640 medium with Glutamax (final concentration 2 mM), pyruvate (final concentration 1 mM) and gentamicin (final concentration 50 μg/mL) and heat it up at 37°C (warm RPMI). RPMI complete medium is referred as “RPMI+”.\nDay 0\nPrepare a suspension of 106 cells per mL in RPMI+. Add 100 μL of cell suspension per well in a sterile 96-well clear flat bottom polystyrene tissue culture-treated plate. When testing a new stimulus: Add at least two technical replicates per stimulus to normalize the number of cells and the cytokine values at the end of the protocol.\nIncubate the plate for 1 h at 37°C 5% CO2 in a tissue culture CO2 incubator to let the monocytes adhere.\nAfter 1 h, remove the supernatant that contains the non-adherent cells and discard it.\nWash off remaining non-adherent cells: Add 200 μL warm PBS per well and then discard it. After this step the purity of monocytes on the plate is >90% (see Bekkering et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nAdd 200 μL of the corresponding trained immunity-inducing stimuli in warm RPMI+ supplemented with 10% human pooled serum per well. Take RPMI+ as a negative control and 1 μg/mL β-glucan or 5 μg/mL BCG as a positive control.\nIncubate 24 h at 37°C, 5% CO2.",
    "Note: The different components of the serum can interact with the stimuli employed (e.g., opsonization) affecting the survival of the cells and/or their ability to induce trained immunity. Therefore, we recommend to try this protocol with different concentrations of serum (0%–10%) every time a new stimulus is tested and compare the percentages of apoptosis/cell death in the wells treated with different concentrations of serum over the length of the experiment (at each washing or change of medium step: day 1, day 3, and day 6).\nNote: PBS should contain calcium. The use of PBS without calcium (or with EDTA) can initiate the detachment of the cells from the well.\nNote: Human serum in this procedure is not heat-inactivated, even though other authors have successfully employed heat-inactivated serum (Leonhardt et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nDay 1\nDiscard supernatant or use for cytokine measurement and/or LDH cytotoxicity assay.\nWash off remaining stimuli with 200 μL of warm PBS and add 200 μL warm RPMI+ supplemented with 10% pooled human serum.\nIncubate for 6 days, refresh medium once at day 3.\nNote: Use PBS without EDTA for the washing step to prevent detaching of the cells.\nNote: It is expected that some cells might detach or undergo apoptosis during the differentiation process.\nDay 3\nDiscard supernatant or use for cytokine measurement and/or LDH cytotoxicity assay.\nAdd 200 μL warm RPMI+ supplemented with 10% pooled human serum.\nDay 6\nDiscard supernatant or use for cytokine measurement and/or LDH cytotoxicity assay. Add 200 μL warm RPMI+ with a secondary stimulus, for example RPMI+ (negative control), 10 ng/mL of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from E. coli or 10 μg/mL of Pam3Cys.\nIncubate for 24 h at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nNote: Day 6 supernatants can also be stored for the determination of lactate.\nDay 7",
    "Centrifuge the plates 350 × g 8 min to spin down cells that detached during the incubation period. Collect 180 μL of supernatants and use immediately or freeze at −20°C for assessment within 2 to 4 weeks, or at −80°C for further assessment. The responsiveness of the cells to heterologous secondary stimulation can be easily assessed by means of ELISA (TNFα or IL-6 levels in the supernatant) (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nNote: Different incubation times and starting cell amounts might be considered depending on the final read-out (FACS, qPCR, ELISA). When new stimuli are tested, there should be an extra step at day 7 to evaluate the live cell numbers per well to normalize the cytokine results to the cell numbers:\nCounting live cells with trypan blue\nCells can be detached from the well by incubating them with cold PBS with 2 mM EDTA for 10 min at 4°C. After this, the cells can be collected from the well by pipetting. Dilute the cells 1:5 with Trypan Blue and count the cells non-stained in blue in a hemocytometer.\nAssessing cytotoxicity\nIf the numbers of cells are different, the cytokine production for that stimulus should be normalized per cell number. LDH cytotoxicity assay needs to be performed with fresh supernatants (not frozen) following the instructions of the manufacturer. The LDH cytotoxicity assay should include per cell type and concentration a positive control of cell lysis and a negative control (medium control), in order to calculate the percentage of cytotoxicity. A difference lower than 10% cytotoxicity between the conditions can be considered as acceptable.",
    "Day 7 or later: Assessment of cytokine levels by ELISA. Perform ELISA following the instructions of the manufacturer. The concentration of cytokines in the supernatant is usually above the detection limit of the commercial kits, so the samples need to be diluted in the dilution buffer specified by the manufacturer. For R&D Duoset ELISA kits, the dilution range of the supernatants from monocytes trained with β-glucan or BCG and restimulated with LPS at day 6 is 10×–20× dilution for TNFα and 25×–100× dilution for the detection of IL-6. The dilutions need to be optimized per stimulus and might differ between laboratories, batches of stimuli, and donors. The appropriate controls for the assay are the following:\nNon-trained, non-rechallenged cells: No detectable cytokine production\nTrained, non-rechallenged cells: No detectable cytokine production\nNon-trained, rechallenged cells: High cytokine production\nTrained, rechallenged cells: Very high cytokine production\nThe magnitude of the induction of trained immunity will correspond to the increase of the production of TNFα or IL-6 between the non-trained, rechallenged cells and trained-rechallenged cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/490-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.
