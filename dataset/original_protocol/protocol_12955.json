    "1. Construction of the LED Illuminator\nNOTE: The required LED equipment is summarized in the List of Materials. The entire LED setup is small and can be placed anywhere in the lab, although we recommend it be placed in a dark room to control light exposure of worms4.\nConnect the LED to a controller with cables (Figure 1A, D).\nConnect the controller to a digital function generator/amplifier with a BNC cable (Figure 1A, C, D).\nFix the LED light 10 cm above the stage using a custom holder (Figure 1A).\n\tNOTE: We made the holder with metal parts.\nCover the LED illumination setup partially, but avoid heat accumulation (Figure 1B), which makes worms sick.\n\tNOTE: We use a custom-made hard plastic cover with open top and bottom (Figure 1A). The cover is not required for the mutagenesis itself, but is used to limit unnecessary exposure of the blue light to the surroundings. We advise to not cover the LED setup entirely (Figure 1B) to prevent overheating the worms.\nWear laser-protective glasses.\n\tNOTE: We wear laser-protective glasses because the light is very bright. Sunglasses may work as well.\nSwitch the lever of the LED controller to 'Int.' for continuous illumination (Figure 1D) and set it at 65% of the maximum power (Figure 1C).\nUse a photometer to measure the blue light intensity on the stage where the worms are placed using manufacturer's protocol. The setup gives 2.0 mW/mm2 under continuous illumination.\n2. Blue Light Treatment\nNOTE: Use the strain CZ20310 juSi164[Pmex-5-HIS-72::miniSOG-3'UTR(tbb-2) + Cb-unc-119(+)] unc-119(ed3)III4. The strain is available at the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC, http://www.cgc.cbs.umn.edu/).\nMaintain the His-mSOG strain in the dark on standard nematode growth medium (NGM) plates with E. coli OP50 following a standard protocol10,11.",
    "NOTE: Under ambient light, juSi164-containing strains do not display a mutation rate above a spontaneous rate4. Routine strain passage using a dissecting scope with a halogen lamp generally does not cause mutations as well. Nonetheless, care should be taken to avoid unnecessary exposure to light, e.g., keeping the strains in a standard dark-inside incubator, or covering the strains with foil. It is advised to freeze aliquots of the strain after receiving it in case unnecessary mutations accumulate over time.\nPick gravid young adult (approximately 12 h post-L4) animals with a worm pick11.\n\tNOTE: Younger animals show less mutagenic effect4, while older animals may have lower brood size.\nCut a filter paper to fit a 60 mm plate with a 25 mm x 25 mm square hole and place onto an unseeded plate (Figure 1E).\n\tNOTE: A square punch can be used but the size of the punch does not have to be precise.\nDrop 100 µL of 100 mM CuCl2 on the filter paper evenly to restrict worms within the square hole on the plate.\nPick desired number of gravid young adult hermaphrodites (see Step 3 for an example) and transfer to the center of the CuCl2 plate.\nWear laser protective glasses.\nSwitch ON the LED and the function generator.\nSwitch the lever of the LED controller to 'Ext.' to control it by the function generator (Figure 1D).\nSet the controller at 65% of the maximum power and the function generator as sine wave, 4 Hz (Figure 1C).\nPlace the CuCl2 plate from Step 2.5 without a lid on the stage under the LED (Figure 1A).\nIlluminate the animals with blue light for 30 min.\nTransfer healthy looking worms to a seeded plate as P0.",
    "NOTE: The desired number of P0 depends on the type of screen. See Step 3 for an example. The P0 worms may appear to be uncoordinated immediately after light treatment and will recover over time.\nKeep worms covered using foil in an incubator or in the dark; and follow the standard procedure to begin screening desired phenotypes among their progeny2,10.\n3. Example of a Forward Genetic Screen\nNOTE: This is an example of the clonal screen with 120 haploid genomes to check if the LED and strain are working. Figure 2 shows a schematic of the procedure.\n[Day1] After blue light treatment, pick five healthy looking worms onto a NGM plate with OP50 as P0, keep them in a 20 °C incubator, and let them lay eggs for 1 d ('Day1' plate).\n[Day2] Transfer P0 onto a new seeded plate ('Day2' plate).\n[Day3] Pick and kill P0 on the 'Day2' plate by burning them.\n[Day4] Pick 30 gravid young adult F1 from the 'Day1' plate and transfer them onto individual plates (30 F1 plates for 'Day1').\n[Day5] Repeat Step 3.4 for the 'Day2' plate (30 F1 plates for 'Day2').\n[Day7-9] Check the abnormal morphologies and/or behavior of F2 worms compared to the WT strain (Figure 3A) under a standard stereomicroscope when they become adults.\n\tNOTE: A heritable mutation displays about a quarter of worms with the same phenotype among F2 when it is recessive with high penetrance. However, some mutants may grow slowly and/or show partial penetrance. Therefore, it is possible that less than a quarter of the mutants can be found on a plate.\nPick worms with visible phenotypes individually and check the heritability of the phenotype in the next generation.\n4. Example of an Extrachromosomal Transgene Integration",
    "Inject the DNA of interest into CZ20310 juSi164[Pmex-5-HIS-72::miniSOG-3'UTR(tbb-2) + Cb-unc-119(+)] unc-119(ed3) and prepare transgenic worms with a low transmission rate (10-30%) following a standard injection protocol12,13.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, established extrachromosomal arrays can be crossed into the juSi164 strains. To avoid genotyping for juSi164, juSi164 heterozygotes may be used as the P0 although efficiency might be decreased. The genotyping method for juSi164 is described in Section 5.\n[Day1] Treat ~20 transgenic animals as P0 with blue light as described in Step 2.\n\tNOTE: More P0 worms are necessary depending on the transmission rate. Transgenes can be identified by phenotypes or coinjection marker12,13.\nPick 10 healthy looking P0 onto individual plates, keep them in a 20 °C incubator, and let them lay eggs for a few days (P0 plates)\n[Day4] Single out 20 transgenic F1 worms from each P0 plate onto individual plates and let them lay eggs. (20 F1 x 10 P0 plates= 200 F1 plates in total.)\n[Day7] Find F1 plates with >75% F2 having transgenes.\nPick five transgenic animals from the >75% transmission rate F1 plates (F2 plates).\n[Day10] Keep F2 plates with 100% transmission rate as potential integrated lines.\nOutcross the potential integrated lines using a standard procedure10 to check the Mendelian segregation and to remove potential background mutations.\n5. Genotyping\nLyse 20 outcrossed F2 worms in lysis buffer using a standard protocol14.\nPerform PCR using the primers for MosSCI insertion9, juSi164, (Table 1) with an annealing temperature of 58 °C following a standard protocol14.\n\tNOTE: It is unnecessary to genotype unc-119(ed3) because unc-119(ed3) can be detected by uncoordinated behavior after removing the rescuing transgene (juSi164) in the following Steps 5.4 and 5.5.\nRun agarose gel electrophoresis15 and examine the band sizes (Table 1) to find the WT for juSi164.",
    "Examine if the F2 progeny has paralyzed worms due to the existence of unc-119(ed3).\nIf uncoordinated worms are found on step 5.4, single several nonuncoordinated worms to obtain all nonuncoordinated worms in the next generation.\nSubscription Required.
