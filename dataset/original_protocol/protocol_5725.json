    "Generation of cell homogenateCulture HeLa cells in a T-75 flask in a humidified BSL-2 incubator at 37 °C containing 25 ml of DMEM culture medium to confluence.Divide the cells equally five 150 mm round culture dishes and culture in the DMEM culture medium (25 ml/plate) to confluence.Remove the media and wash each plate using 10 ml of PBS.Add 2 ml of 1x trypsin solution to cover the surface of each plate and incubate the plates for 2 min at 37 °C in a humidified cell incubator.Tap the plates horizontally to suspend the cells and add 6 ml of culture medium to each plate.Harvest cells from each plate and combine in a 50 ml Falcon tube. Harvest cells by centrifugation for 5 min at 400 x g.Re-suspend cells in 50 ml of PBS and wash by centrifugation for 5 min at 400 x g. Repeat this step once.Re-suspend cells in 4 ml of 0.25 M sucrose buffer containing the protease inhibitor PMSF (0.25 mM) and pipet to get a single cell suspension.Assemble an isobiotec cell homogenizer using a 10 μm metal ball and pre-chill the cell homogenizer on ice (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180418/20180418014031_3518.jpgFigure 1. Assembly of the Isobiotec cell homogenizer. A. Parts of the homogenizer including the metal ball (10 μm clearance) in the white tube; B. Side view; C. The metal ball is placed in the central passage. D. Completed assembly of the homogenizer. E. Each outlet is fitted with a 5 ml syringe. F. 2 ml of cell suspension is added to one syringe (water is used in this demonstration). G. Press to pass the cell suspension through the metal ball-fitted central passage into the other syringe. Repeat another 11 times before harvesting the cell homogenate.Fit the two outlets on the homogenizer each with a 5 ml syringe.",
    "Remove the plunger from one syringe to add 2 ml of the cell suspension. Pass the cell suspension 12 times through the homogenizer.Transfer the homogenized cell lysate into a 15 ml Falcon tube on ice and repeat homogenization with the rest of the cell suspension.Wash the homogenizer 2 times each with 1 ml of 0.25 M sucrose buffer and combine with the lysate.Isolation of nucleiCentrifuge the cell homogenate for 10 min at 600 x g and 4 °C to pellet the nuclei.Re-suspend the pellet in 5 ml of 2.2 M sucrose buffer in Nalgene Oak Ridge High-Speed Centrifuge Tubes.Centrifuge for 30 min at 50,000 x g and 4 °C.Remove supernatant and add 2 ml of 0.25 M sucrose buffer to rinse the tube area near the pellet.Remove the sucrose buffer without disturbing the pellet.Re-suspend the pellet in 4 ml of 0.25 M sucrose buffer and transfer to a 15 ml Falcon tube.Centrifuge for 5 min at 600 x g and 4 °C.Depletion of the nuclear envelope (NE)Preparation of Triton-containing sucrose buffer.Add 0.1 ml of Triton X-100 in a 15 ml tube along the tube wall.Add 10 ml of 0.25 M sucrose buffer to the tube and vortex till Triton is mixed thoroughly with the sucrose buffer.Re-suspend the nuclear pellet in 4 ml of Triton-containing sucrose buffer and incubate for 1 h on ice.Centrifuge for 5 min at 600 x g and 4 °C. Re-suspend the pellet in another 5 ml of Triton-containing sucrose buffer.Centrifuge for 5 min at 600 x g and 4 °C.Wash these Triton-extracted nuclei (TxN) 2 times using 0.25 M sucrose buffer.Then resuspend the pellet in 0.9 ml of 0.25 M sucrose buffer.Extraction of the nuclear scaffold (Figure 2)Add 0.1 ml 5 M NaCl solution to the nuclear suspension (colloidal gel forms immediately at the interface).",
    "Pipette vigorously 20-30 times using a 1,000 L Eppendorf pipette until the entire suspension turns into a uniform colloidal gel.Add 0.5 ml of 0.25 M sucrose buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl and pipette to homogeneity.Centrifuge for 10 min at 2,000 x g and recover a small volume of supernatant if it is clearly observed.Add 0.5 ml of 0.25 M sucrose buffer and the colloidal gel should shrink immediately.Poke the gel vigorously using a 0.2 ml pipette tip so that the gel continues to shrink.Centrifuge for 10 min at 2,000 x g and 4 °C and recover the clear supernatant.Add another 0.5 ml of 0.25 M sucrose buffer to the pellet and continue to poke the fragment until it ceases shrinking (It should look like a brown and non-transparent fragment).Centrifuge again and combine all the supernatants as the extract.Measure the A280 absorption of the combined TxN extracts or TxNE. It should range 1.0-2.0. Aliquot TxNE in non-adhesive 1.5-ml microtubes and store at -80 °C.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180418/20180418014450_9740.jpgFigure 2. Extraction of TxNE from the nuclei. A. Single cell suspension generated from 6 x 108 HeLa cells in 1.35 ml of 2.5 M sucrose buffer. B. After adding 0.15 ml of 5 M NaCl, the interphase moved rapidly upward giving a transparent lower phase in less than 30 sec. C. After vigorously pipetting for ~30 times in less than 1 min, the entire cell suspension became one single colloidal gel. D. 0.75 ml of the 0.25 M sucrose buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl was added to the gel and mixed by tapping for ~20 times. E. Centrifuge for 10 min at 2,000 x g and ~0.2 ml supernatant can be recovered from the top. F. Add 0.75 ml of the 0.",
    "25 sucrose buffer (without additional NaCl) and mix vigorously for 1-2 min to observe the gel shrinking. Poke the gel 20-50 times with a 10-200 L tip fitted on a pipette until the gel stop shrinking. Centrifuge for 10 min at 2,000 x g and harvest the supernatant. G. Add 0.75 ml of the 0.25 M sucrose buffer to the pellet. H. Continue to ~50 times until when the pellet shrunk into an irregular fragment. Some smaller fragments are also visible. I. Centrifuge for 10 min at 1,000 x g to recover the supernatant. J. The supernatants are combined as TxNE and the pellet is typically the extracted chromatins which retained the cellular DNA and core histones.Note: To show the sample status in each step more clearly, we have scaled up the solution volumes 1.5x of that described in the main text of the protocol for photograph."
