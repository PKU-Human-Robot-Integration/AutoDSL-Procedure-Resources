  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: All methods shown in this protocol have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Preparation of Surgical Table\nSet up the heating pad with recirculating warm water on the surgical table, under the dissection microscope. Place the stainless steel base plate onto the heating pad. Place a sterile absorbent pad on the base plate and heating pad.\nArrange sterile surgical tools on an adjacent sterile absorbent pad. Gather two pairs of angled fine-tipped forceps, two pairs of angled forceps, three hemostatic forceps, two retractors wires, small surgical scissors, micro-scissors, one angioplasty wire (0.15 inch diameter) and three 6-inch segments of 6.0 silk suture.\nBend the round end of the angioplasty wire to match the curvature of the femoral artery. This will make it easier to advance the wire during the surgery.\n2. Preparation of Mouse for Surgery\nAnesthetize a mouse by continuous inhalation of 2.5% isoflurane. Be sure to monitor the animal’s status throughout the procedure. Perform a pinch test of the mouse’s foot to confirm that it is fully anesthetized. Ensure the animal does not move when the pinch test is administered.\nApply a lubricating ointment to the animal’s eyes to prevent desiccation. Secure the animal in the supine position to the absorbent pad using surgical tape. Continue administering 2.5% isoflurane via nose cone.\nUsing a depilatory cream, remove fur from the leg and abdomen to the mid-line. Rinse the skin thoroughly with water. Depilation can be performed one day in advance of surgery. Note that excessive treatment with the cream may lead to skin irritation.\nImmediately before surgery, apply povidone-iodine to the depilated area with a cotton-tipped applicator to sterilize the skin. Rinse the depilated skin with 70% ethanol and dry with a sterile cotton-tipped applicator.  Repeat 3 times.",
    "Administer a pre-operative dose of 5 mg/kg of carprofen via subcutaneous injection.\n3. Isolation of the Femoral Artery\nUsing small surgical scissors, make a curved incision in the skin over the femoral artery. Bluntly dissect and secure surrounding tissues using retractors magnetic retractor fixators to locate the femoral artery. Moisten the tissues periodically using saline for irrigation Apply saline using a sterile cotton-tipped applicator.\nIsolate the femoral artery using forceps. Gently separate the nerve from the vascular bundle using fine-tipped forceps. Avoid puncturing the vein, and do not damage the nerve. Push the nerve away from the bundle to avoid stimulating it.\nGently separate the femoral vein from the femoral artery, locating the femoral bifurcation. The region of the bifurcation is especially difficult to dissect.\nPosterior to the bifurcation, loop a 6.0 silk suture under the femoral artery and secure with a hemostat. This proximal suture will be used to restrict blood flow in the artery.\n\tNOTE: There is a slight variation in the ties when performing the ligation method versus the cauterization method (see Figure 1 and Figure 2).\nDistal to the bifurcation, loop 6.0 silk suture under the femoral artery and secure with a hemostat. This distal suture aids in the positioning of the artery.\nLoop two sutures under the muscular branch of the femoral artery, pre-tie them and secure with a hemostat. Remember to moisten the tissues with saline. If performing the cautery method of wire injury, only one looped suture is necessary on the muscular branch.\n4. Performance of Femoral Artery Wire Injury\nRestrict blood flow into the femoral artery by pulling the proximal suture. Slightly pull the distal hemostat and hemostat securing the branch to expose the site for the arteriotomy. Ligate the muscular branch by tying the suture around it.",
    "NOTE: Lifting the artery upward will more effectively restrict blood flow than pulling horizontally alone.\nSever the small branch with the cautery between the two sutures. Using micro-scissors, perform an arteriotomy in the side branch of the bifurcation. Use forceps balanced on a roll of surgical tape to stabilize the micro-scissors.\nConfirm the presence of the arteriotomy using fine-tipped forceps. Gently lift the opening of the arteriotomy with the forceps. Introduce the rounded end of the wire into the arteriotomy using forceps. To ease advancement of the wire, add one or two drops of lidocaine to the region using a syringe.\nWhen the wire reaches the proximal suture, release the suture and adjust it so that it cannot impede the advancement of the wire. Insert the wire until it cannot advance further. The tip of the wire should stop in the region of the inguinal ligament.\nAllow the wire to remain in the femoral artery for one minute. After one minute, retract and advance the wire in a sawing motion ten times to injure and denude the endothelium of the femoral artery. For an injury of lesser severity, decrease the number of times the wire is pulled in and out of the artery or leave the wire in the artery for 1 min only.\nRetract the wire slowly. When the round end of the wire has passed the proximal suture, restrict flow into the artery by pulling the proximal suture. Retract the wire completely.\n5. Ligating the Muscular Branch\nTighten the remaining suture on the muscular branch. This will prevent bleeding from the arteriotomy. Return flow to the muscular branch, and confirm that blood is not leaking from it. Trim the ends from the sutures on the muscular branch.\n6. Alternative Method: Localized Cauterization of the Arteriotomy",
    "NOTE: An alternative approach can be taken to avoid ligation of the muscular branch and allow vascular access through the larger main femoral artery.\nStarting from 4.1, restrict flow to the femoral artery by pulling on the proximal suture. Pull the distal suture and the suture securing the muscular branch slightly to expose the site for the arteriotomy (Figure 1 and Figure 2).\nUsing micro-scissors, perform an arteriotomy at the branch point of the femoral artery and the muscular branch. If the incision is made in the side of the artery, it may be easier to cauterize. Use forceps balanced on a roll of surgical tape to stabilize the micro-scissors.\nTo test the success of cauterization, restore flow to the femoral artery by loosening the proximal suture. If bleeding occurs from the arteriotomy, repeat the cautery. If the cautery is successful, blood flow will be restored distal to the arteriotomy.\nIntroduce the wire and perform the wire injury as described in section 4.\nContinue restricting blood flow into the femoral artery. Heat a fine-tipped cautery at least 6 inches away from the mouse. As the cautery tip cools, apply it lightly side of the arteriotomy to close the incision.\nTo test the success of cauterization, restore flow to the femoral artery by loosening the proximal suture. If bleeding occurs from the arteriotomy, repeat the cautery. If the cautery is successful, blood flow will be restored distal to the arteriotomy. Remove the temporary proximal and distal ties.\n7. Implantation of Perivascular Drug Delivery Patch\nCreate a perivascular drug patch can be created as described in previous studies11 or by using similar methods. Blunt the corners of the barrier region of the drug delivery patch using sterile scissors",
    "Place the drug delivery patch onto the injured femoral artery with the drug-releasing side facing the artery. As necessary, use forceps to improve the position of the patch.\n8. Wound Closure and Recovery\nClose the wound with a simple interrupted suture consisting of square knots. A discontinuous suture prolongs wound closure in case the animal tries to remove the suture.\nTurn off the anesthesia and remove the animal from the set up. Allow the animal to recover on the warming pad.\nContinue to monitor the mouse’s recovery. Check the incision site each day to ensure that it remains closed. For treatment of post-surgical pain, administer a subcutaneous injection of 5 mg/kg of carprofen every 12 hr after surgery and then every 12 hr for 2 days. If pain continues beyond the initial 2 days, consult a veterinarian for directions on further pain medication.\n9. Harvesting Femoral Arteries for Histology\nAt 28 days post-surgery, perform carbon dioxide euthanasia on the mouse.\n\tNOTE: The appropriate flow rate of carbon dioxide should displace 10-30% of the chamber per minute and will vary depending on the size of the chamber used. Cutting of the diaphragm and cardiac puncture should be performed as a secondary method of euthanasia.\nSecure the mouse in the supine position using surgical tape. Make an incision over the femoral artery, where the initial surgical incision was made.\nFor both the injured artery and the uninjured artery from the contralateral leg, bluntly dissect and secure surrounding tissues using retractors and magnetic retractor fixators to locate the femoral artery. Moisten the tissues periodically using saline for irrigation. Apply saline using a sterile cotton-tipped applicator. Take care to not damage the artery.",
    "After the femoral artery has been isolated from the site of the original arteriotomy to the abdominal aorta, tie a segment of silk suture near the original site of the arteriotomy. This suture will help identify the most distal end of the femoral artery and ease handling of the sample.\nUsing the micro-dissection scissors to excise the femoral artery. Make one incision distal to the suture. Make the other incision on the opposite end of the femoral artery, beside the abdominal aorta.\nTransfer the excised artery to a glass petri dish containing saline. Dissect the artery further to remove excess connective tissue or fat. Gently remove blood from the lumen by rinsing with saline.\nTransfer the artery to a vial of 10% buffered formalin. Store the vial at 4 °C with gentle rocking for 48 hr.\nTransfer the fixed artery to 70% ethanol, to store until it is processed for histology.\nEmbed the artery in paraffin blocks and section the blocks for staining.\nPerform histochemical and immunochemical staining to assess the extent of injury and intimal hyperplasia.\n\tNOTE: For the representative results, we used Hematoxylin and Eosin to visualize the nuclei and overall morphology or a Movat’s Pentachrome stain to visualize the elastic lamellae and other arterial components.\nSubscription Required.
