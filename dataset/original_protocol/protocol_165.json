    "This section includes three parts: the procedure of Metabolic Route Search \\(MRS), Metabolic Route Design \\(MRD) and the complementary usages of MRS and MRD.\n**Metabolic Route Search \\(MRS)**\nSet source and product metabolites and specify search constraints\n1. To search a route between two metabolites, visit the metabolic route search submodule webpage \\(text to link\":http://bioinfo.ustc.edu.cn/softwares/mrsd/SearchRoute.html)\n  2. Select represent type of metabolite, includes name, formula, KEGG ID or the InChI string. \n   \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/1980/original/1.png?1321498740\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n      Figure 3 representation types of the metabolites\n3. Enter the source and product metabolite. \n  \n <a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/1981/original/2.png?1321498903\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\nFigure 4 the source and product metabolites\n4. Select the organisms in which you want to perform the metabolic route search. The type includes one organism, multiple organisms or all available organisms in KEGG.\n  \n <a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/1982/original/3.png?1321498944\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\nFigure 5 there are two options of the organisms’ type: all available organisms and select. Detailed information about the options can be found in “Select the organisms” section.\n5. Specify the metabolites that must be included or excluded. \n  \n <a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/1983/original/4.png?1321498976\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\nFigure 6 the intermediates constraints\nCAUTION: The identifier used to represent the metabolites that should be included or excluded must be the same as the source and product metabolite, which means if you use name to represent the source and product metabolite, the included and excluded metabolite should use name, too. Otherwise, the system will be unable to deal with it.\nThe user can specify a list of intermediate metabolites that should be included or excluded in the result metabolic routes. All these intermediate metabolites are separated by vertical lines.",
    "CAUTION: The number of the intermediate metabolites is not limited. Please notice that the number of the excluded metabolites has no influence on the time cost of computing, while the number of the included metabolites has remarkable influence.\n6. Specify the maximum number of the result routes. The default number is ten, and you can change it as large as you want. The larger the number is, the more result routes you will get and more time you will spend.\n  \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/1984/original/5.png?1321499014\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\nFigure 7 the number constraint of the result routes\n7. Click “continue” to check the validity of your inputs.\n  CAUTION: The time of the search operation depends on the number of organisms that you have chosen, the size of the included metabolites and the maximum number of the result routes that you have specified.\n <a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/1985/original/6.png?1321499048\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\nFigure 8 Set the source and product metabolite and specify the other search constraints. \nInput and constraints check\n8. Select if you want to display the detailed information of the provided candidates of your input metabolites. If you chose yes, then you can see the structure and the formula information of the metabolites, otherwise, these information will not be displayed. \n  \n <a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/1986/original/7.png?1321499080\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\nFigure 9 select to display the details of the candidate metabolites or not\nCAUTION: If you chose yes, it may take a little time to load the information when you select a candidate metabolite each time.\n9. Specify the source and product metabolites from the possible candidates that provided by the system. These candidates are calculated by MRS according the metabolite you input. \n   \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/1987/original/8.png?1321499144\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\nFigure 10 specify the source and product metabolites from the possible candidates",
    "10. Check other constraints.\n  11. Submit the search task. After you have check the source and product metabolite and other constraints, then you can submit to perform this search.\n  \n <a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/1988/original/9.png?1321499180\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\nFigure 11 Input and constraints check.\n12. After the search process, the system provides two kinds of result: the graphic result and the detailed text result. \n   \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/1989/original/10.png?1321499231\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\nFigure 12 the result of the metabolic route search submodule. The first half is the graphic result, while the second half is the detailed text result.\n13. Highlight the route. If you want to highlight a specific route in the graphic result, you can just click the corresponding highlight button of the route, and then the system will highlight it in the graphic result.\n   \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/1990/original/11.png?1321499262\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\nFigure 13 the highlight function of the MRS system\n**Metabolic Route Design \\(MRD)**\nSet start metabolites and specify design constraints\n1. To design a route from a metabolite, visit the metabolic route search submodule webpage \\(text to link\":http://bioinfo.ustc.edu.cn/softwares/mrsd/RouteDesign.html).\n  2. Select the direction of the metabolic route design operation. There two kinds of direction: forward and backward.\n   \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/1991/original/12.png?1321499295\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\nFigure 14 the direction option of the design process\nCAUTION: The system provides the candidate metabolites mainly based on the direction of the design operation. The result will be vastly different from one direction to another.\n3. Select the representation type of the metabolite.\n  4. Set the start metabolite.\n   \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/1992/original/13.png?1321499342\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\nFigure 15 specify the start metabolite of design process\n5. Click “Continue” to check your inputs.\n   \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/1993/original/14.png?1321499380\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\nFigure 16 Set start metabolite and specify design constraints",
    "6. If you just want to know how the system works, click the “Example” button, and then the system will provide an predefined start metabolite and other default constraints to start the design process.\n  Input and constraints check\n7. Select if you want to display the detailed information about the provided candidates of your inputted metabolites. \n  8. Check the direction of the design process.\n  9. Check the representation type of the metabolite.\n  10. Specify the start metabolites from the possible candidates that provided by the system. These candidates are calculated by MRD according to the metabolite you have inputted.\n   \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/1994/original/15.png?1321499434\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\nFigure 17 Check the inputs of design process.\nThe interactive design process\n11. According to the start metabolite and the design direction, the MRD system calculates and provides all possible candidates in KEGG. The MRSD system also provides the reaction information of the specified metabolite and the candidate, which can assist user to select candidate.\n  TROUBLESHOOTING\n \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/1995/original/16.png?1321499494\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\nFigure 18 Mouse over the picture of the candidate metabolite to view the details of the reactions between the specified metabolite and the candidate.\n12. The user can choose any of the candidate metabolites to continue the design process recurrently. If one candidate has already existed in the previous steps, then it will be highlighted in case the user reselects it which will make a circle.\n   \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/1996/original/17.png?1321499562\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\nFigure 19 The MRD system will highlight the candidates that have already been selected in the previous design process.\n13. If there are no candidates available or the user has found the route he wanted, the design process ends.",
    "14. Save the design route result. In each step, you can view the result file and save it in your local computer. \n   \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/1997/original/18.png?1321499604\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\nFigure 20 Save the result file in your local computer\nCAUTION: If you save the result file in order to restart the design process in the future, please don’t modify the content of the result file, which may cause some undefined errors and unable for the MRD system to analyze the data in the file.\nRestart the design process from previous paused point \n15. Select the previous design result file and upload it to restart the design process. Then the system will analyze the previous result file to get necessary information to continue the design process. \n  \n <a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/1998/original/19.png?1321499635\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\nFigure 21 Upload the previous metabolic route design result file\n**Use MRD to modify the result of MRS**\nIn “the complementary uses of MRS and MRD” section, we introduce the methods how to combine the two systems to fulfill the user’s needs. In this section, we will show the detailed protocol of the conjunctive uses of MRS and MRD.\n1. Use MRS to search the metabolic routes between the specified source and product metabolite.\n  2. Chose the route that you want to modify, and then click “design it” button to revise this route using MRD.\n   \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/1999/original/20.png?1321499669\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\nFigure 22 Use the \"design it\" function to modify the route",
    "3. After you click the “design it” button, the system will switch from MRS to MRD. In the MRD system, you can select the candidate metabolites that MRD provided to add step to the existing route, or you can use the “delete the last step” function to delete steps in the route and then redesign it.\n   \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/2000/original/21.png?1321499698\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\nFigure 23 Use the MRD system to redesign the route\n4. You can save this route to the local after you get the right metabolic route."
