    "Refer to Figure 1 for an overview of the two methodologies used in this protocol.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180910/20180910194024_6618.jpgFigure 1. Overview of the Retroviral Capsid Core Stability Assay. Figure adapted from Renner et al., 2018a. A. Approach 1. Retroviruses are stripped of their envelope phospholipid bilayer coat via an initial treatment with detergent. These envelope-deficient (Env-free) capsids are subjected to ultracentrifugation, which briefly exposes them to an additional detergent treatment before entering a detergent-free sucrose solution. The density of this bottom layer containing 20% sucrose allows for efficient pelleting of intact capsids, but is a barrier to pelleting free CA protein and less dense protein complexes. B. Approach 2. A similar approach can be performed without the detergent pre-treatment step on native viruses. In this situation, the viruses will then be slightly more resistant to the detergent layer in the sucrose column. Performing these methods in combination will provide informative results about viral capsid core stability. The pellet is then analyzed by SDS-PAGE using antibodies specific to the CA protein, in this case p30 of M-MLV.Seed 10 cm dishes with viral producer cells (i.e., viable infected cells that produce representative viral particles) in 8 ml of complete DMEM. For this assay, we typically seed 2 dishes each with 2 x 106 NIH 3T3 cells, chronically infected with MLV. Alternatively, the cells (such as 293T) can be transfected with a virus expressing plasmid (see Notes 1 and 2).Allow the cells to propagate and produce virus at 37 °C in 5% CO2 until they reach confluence; this should take approximately 72-96 h. Confluence is determined by lack of surface area remaining on the well's growth surface. Before collecting the viral supernatant, pre-cool the ultracentrifuge to 4 °C.",
    "Collect the viral supernatant (roughly 15 ml) using a serological pipette, and transfer it into a 50 ml conical tube. In these conditions, this is an excess of virus that will allow for multiple attempts at SDS-PAGE analysis if necessary.Centrifuge this supernatant for 5 min at 500 x g at room temperature (20-25 °C) to clear cellular debris.During this centrifugation step, prepare the appropriate number of syringes and 0.45 μm filters.Transfer the cleared supernatant into a syringe and filter it directly into another 50 ml conical tube.Approach 1: Add Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 10% (i.e., 1.7 ml Triton X-100 + 15 ml viral supernatant), mix by inversion or pipetting. Incubate at room temperature (20-25 °C) for 20 min (see Note 3).Approach 2: Move to Step 9. Transfer the solution into a Type 70Ti tube.If necessary, top up each tube with media or PBS such that they contain approximately 7.5 ml below the maximum threshold.Place a sterile Pasteur pipette into each 70Ti tube, with the thin side immersed in viral media. Placement and use of the Pasteur pipette in this fashion is shown in Figure 2 of a recent publication by our laboratory (Renner et al., 2018b). Slowly add the sterile 5% sucrose-detergent buffer of choice, 2 ml of this is sufficient (see Note 4). This allows for a short exposure to detergent before passing through the denser, 20% sucrose solution, which is detergent-free. In our experiments, we typically use 5% sucrose + 2-10% Triton X-100 or 0.2% SDS. Using the same Pasteur pipette, slowly add the sterile 20% sucrose solution through the Pasteur pipette so it may form a cushioning layer below the detergent layer (see Note 4). Five milliliters of this solution is sufficient.",
    "Insert the lids and caps onto the tubes and balance each tube appropriately for ultracentrifugation (within 0.05 g). Sterile media or PBS can be used to adjust the mass of viral samples (see Note 5).Cap each tube, ensuring the O-rings and aluminum caps are sealed properly. Insert these tubes appropriately into the Type 70Ti rotor and insert the rotor into the ultracentrifuge (see Note 5).Ultracentrifuge these samples with an acceleration and deceleration set to maximum, for 2 h at 4 °C at approximately 100,000 x g.Remove the tubes from the rotor, visualize the pellets and circle with a marker. These pellets are rather translucent with a white tinge, as the envelope should have been stripped from them at this stage. As time passes after the centrifugation, these pellets become more difficult to see and may dislodge, so samples need to be processed as fast as possible. Gently remove supernatants using a serological pipette and resuspend the pellet in buffer of choice. We typically use 250 µl Laemmli sample buffer for analysis by SDS-PAGE. Resuspend slowly and carefully to avoid the introduction of bubbles.Store at -20 °C or -80 °C until ready for analysis."
