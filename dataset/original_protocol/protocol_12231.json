    "All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Albany Medical College and performed according to the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n1. Solution Preparations\nNOTE: The Rosa26CreERT2 15, R26R-Confetti16, αMHC-Cre17,and Rosa26-mTmG (mTmG)20 mouse lines were purchased commercially. cTnT-Cre18 was a gift from Dr. Jiao at University of Alabama. Nfatc1-Cre was a gift from Dr. Bin Zhou at Albert Einstein College of Medicine19. Mice were euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation in a closed chamber for at least 60 seconds followed by physical means of death verification by bilateral thoracotomy, decapitation or cervical dislocation.\nPrepare Tamoxifen. Dissolve 10 mg of Tamoxifen in 10 ml of sunflower seed oil. Once it is completely dissolved, aliquot and store at -20 °C.\nPrepare phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Dissolve Na2HPO4 (1.41960 g), KH2PO4 (0.24496 g), NaCl (8.0669 g) and KCl (0.20129 g) in 1 L of distilled water and adjust the pH to 7.4.\nPrepare PBST:0.1% Tween-20 solution in PBS by dissolving 100 μl of Tween-20 in 100 ml of PBS.\nPrepare blocking buffer. Make 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) blocking solution by dissolving 3 g of BSA in 100 ml of PBST containing 0.2% Tween-20.\nPrepare CUBIC-1 (reagent 1). Mix 25 wt% urea, 25 wt% N, N, N', N'-tetrakis (2-hydroxypropyl) ethylenediamine and 15 wt% Triton X-100 in dH2O.\nPrepare CUBIC-2 (reagent 2). Mix 50 wt% sucrose, 25 wt% urea, 10 wt% 2, 2′, 2′'-nitrilotriethanol and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in dH2O.\nPrepare Scale A2: 4 M urea, 10% w/v glycerol and 0.1% w/v Triton X-100 in dH2O. Adjust the pH to 7.7.\nPrepare Scale B4: 8 M urea and 0.1% w/v Triton X-100 in dH2O. Adjust the pH to 8.7.",
    "Prepare Scale 70: 4 M urea, 70% w/v glycerol and 0.1% w/v Triton X-100 in dH2O.\n2. Tamoxifen Induction, Embryo Isolation and Fixation\nTamoxifen Induction and Embryo Isolation\n\t\nUsing a curved feeding tube approved protocol (ACUP 13-12007), gavage the female R26CreERT2 Confetti mice (plugged by R26CreERT2 male mice) with 10 µg/g of Tamoxifen at embryonic developmental day E7.7533. At embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) or E10.5, euthanize the female mice with CO2 and cervical dislocation.\nAfter verification of mouse death (see Section 1 Note), open the mouse abdominal cavity with scissors and dissect out the uterine horn, remove the uterine tube layers with the help of scissors and tweezers, and release the embryos from the uterine tube23,24.\n\t\t\nTransfer the embryos to a petri dish containing PBS (pH 7.4). Under the dissecting microscope, remove the non-embryonic layers (chorion, yolk sac and amnion) with the help of tweezers.\nUsing tweezers and scissors, collect the female mouse and embryo tail samples for genotyping as previously reported22. Using a plastic pipette, transfer each embryo to a well of a 48 well plate containing 1 ml of 1x PBS.\nUnder a fluorescent microscope, identify the GFP/RFP/CFP positive embryos via an inverted microscope with a camera. Peel away the pericardium using tweezers and rotate the heart/embryo with the help of curved tweezers to determine the number of fluorescent clones on both sides of the heart with the GFP/RFP/CFP filters. No cuts are needed.\nAfter identifying GFP/RFP/CFP positive embryos, quickly wash the embryos twice (2 min each) with 1x PBS in the 48 well-plate on a plate shaker at room temperature (RT). This will remove excess blood.",
    "Fix the embryo/embryonic heart using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at RT. The fixation time depends on the embryonic age and tissue size. For E9.5 fix the embryo for 2 hr at RT. The late embryonic stage embryos require longer fixation time, which can even be prolonged to 24 hr for postnatal heart.\n\tCAUTION: Paraformaldehyde is toxic, avoid contact with skin, eyes and mucous membrane.\nAfter fixation, wash the embryo/heart in the 48 well-plate twice (10 min each) with 1x PBS on a plate shaker at RT. This removes the excess PFA from the embryo/heart. The embryos are then further processed for whole mount staining and tissue clearing.\n3. Whole Mount Staining\nNOTE: After PFA fixation the embryo/heart is subjected to whole mount staining as follows.\nPermeabilize the embryo/heart in a 48 well-plate using 1 ml of 0.1% PBST for 2 hr on plate shaker at RT.\nFollowing permeabilization, immerse the embryo/heart in 1 ml of blocking buffer, for 2 hr or overnight on a plate shaker at 4 ºC.\nImmerse the embryo/heart to the endothelial cell-specific antibody PECAM (CD31), diluted (1:100) in 0.3 ml blocking buffer for 48 hr on plate shaker at 4 ºC.\nWash the embryo/heart using PBST 5 times, 30 min each at RT on plate shaker. This removes the excess non-specific bound primary antibody from the tissue.\nImmerse the embryo/heart in Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-rat secondary antibody, diluted (1:1,000) in 1 ml blocking buffer for 48 hr on plate shaker at 4 ºC.\nRepeat step 3.4 to wash the secondary antibody.\nPost-fix the embryo/heart with 4% PFA for 1 hr at RT on plate shaker and wash twice with PBS 5 min each.",
    "Stain the embryo/heart with the nuclear stain 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (diluted in PBST at a concentration of 0.01 mg/mL) for 10 min on plate shaker at RT. Follow with two PBS washes of 5 min each.\n4. Embryo/heart Clearing with Scale or CUBIC Method\nNOTE: After whole mount staining, the embryo/heart is subjected to either the Scale or CUBIC tissue clearing method. The choice of method depends on the tissue size and embryonic age. For E11.5 or earlier age embryos, use Scale tissue clearing method, while for older embryos or postnatal hearts the CUBIC tissue clearing method is preferred.\nScale Tissue Clearing Method\n\t\nIncubate the embryo/heart with 1 ml of Scale A2 solution in a scintillation vial (wrapped in aluminum foil) with occasional gentle shaking (by hand) for 48 hr at 4 °C.\nAfter Scale A2 incubation, incubate the embryo/heart with 1 mL of Scale B4 solution at 4 °C in the same vial with occasional gentle shaking for another 48 hr.\nIncubate the embryo/heart for another 48 hr with 1 ml Scale 70 at 4 °C with occasional gentle shaking. Mount embryo using 90% glycerol (see section 5.1).\nCUBIC Tissue Clearing Method\n\t\nFor whole embryo/heart CUBIC clearing, immerse each embryo/heart in 1 ml of CUBIC-1 with occasional gentle shaking for 48 hr at 37 ºC7. After 48 hr, replace the solution with the same volume of fresh CUBIC reagent 1, and incubate the sample for an additional 48 hr at 37 °C with occasional shaking with hand.\nWash the CUBIC-1 treated heart/embryo with 1x PBS several times at room temperature with gentle shaking with hand. This removes the excess CUBIC-1 solution.",
    "After washing out CUBIC-1 with PBS, immerse the embryos/hearts in CUBIC-2 solution (1 g per embryo/heart) for 48 hr at 37 ºC with occasional gentle shaking with hand. This follows embryo/heart mounting using glycerol (see section 5.2).\n5. Sample Mounting and Imaging\nNOTE: The cleared embryos or organs in Scale 70 or CUBIC-2 solution can be imaged directly with Scale 70 and CUBIC-2 solution as the imaging medium, respectively. However, considering the vulnerability of the embryonic samples to clearing reagents, if the samples are not be imaged immediately, but stored long-term, store the samples in 90% glycerol following the protocol below.\nDirectly immerse the Scale cleared sample in 1 ml of 90% glycerol and store at 4 °C until imaging.\nWash the CUBIC treated sample with 1x PBS twice, 5 min each and sequentially incubate the sample with 1 ml of 30%, 50%, 70% and 90% glycerol solution each for 30 min.\nFor imaging, transfer the sample to glass bottom Petri dish with a minimal amount of 90% glycerol and image clones with a confocal microscope equipped with two photon capabilities.\nImage the heart or embryo in the glycerol with a 10X/0.3 NA, a 25X/0.8 NA immersion, or a 40X/1.2 NA water corrective objective lens. Image DAPI using 2-photon excitation from a coherent titanium:sapphire chameleon laser. The choice of microscope and objective lens will depend on the purpose of the experiments, e.g. for super-resolution, a light sheet fluorescent microscope could be utilized.\nSubscription Required.
