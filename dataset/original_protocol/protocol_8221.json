    "All experimental procedures described here have been approved by the Kyoto University Animal Care Committee.\n1. Animals (Day 1)\nPrepare female C57BL/6J mice (n = 6, aged 3−5 weeks).\nNOTE: This protocol is applicable to all rodent species.\n2. MRI Settings (Day 1)\nPut the mouse in an acrylic anesthesia box placed on a heater mat adjusted to 37 °C using a heater mat controller.\nAnesthetize the mouse with 2% isoflurane in air flowing through the box at a flow rate of 1.4 L/min using an anesthesia system, which is composed of an isoflurane vaporizer, air flow meter, and air compressor.\nAfter the induction of anesthesia, place the mouse in an MRI-compatible cradle in the prone position. Check if the anesthesia is sufficient by clipping a toe of the mouse with tweezers to see if it does not feel pain.\nFix the mouse’s head with the tooth bar and face mask equipped with the cradle. Then, maintain the anesthesia with 1%−1.5% isoflurane in air at 1.4 L/min via the face mask.\nInsert a thermistor temperature probe into the rectum of the mouse and place a pressure-sensitive respiration sensor on the back of the mouse.\nTransfer the cradle to the bore of an MRI magnet. Adjust the isoflurane concentration to around 1%−1.5% to ensure a stable and reproducible depth of anesthesia. Monitor if body temperature is controlled between 33−35 °C and the respiration rate between 0.5−1.3 Hz during the whole period of MRI experiments, using a monitoring system (Table of Materials) for the physiological parameters of small animals with dedicated software (Table of Materials).\nUsing the measured value of the rectal temperature, regulate the body temperature by controlling the temperature of warm air supplied in the magnet bore from a heater system equipped in the monitoring system.",
    "3. MRI Acquisitions (Day 1)\nPreparations for the high-resolution 3D T2-weighted MRI scan\nAcquire three magnetic resonance (MR) images in three orthogonal (axial, coronal, and sagittal) planes in order to check the mouse’s position.\nReferring to these images, adjust the position of the mouse by moving the cradle so that the center of the mouse brain is positioned at the center of the resonator as well as at the center of the gradient coils in axial direction.\nAdjust the MRI system by tuning the resonator, adjusting the static magnetic field homogeneity (shimming) and the basic frequency, and calibrating the radio frequency (RF) power.\nAcquire low-resolution 2D multislice T2-weighted (T2W) images with coronal and sagittal orientations. Based on these images, determine the field of view (FOV) for a high-resolution 3D T2W MRI scan.\nPerform localized shimming using a FASTMAP automatic shim algorithm. For the FASTMAP protocol, select a rectangular region that covers the whole brain. After the completion of the localized shimming, confirm the B0 field inhomogeneity within the brain region by a localized 1H spectrum by using point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS).\nAcquire low-resolution 3D T2W images to make sure the scan settings for high-resolution 3D T2W MRI are appropriate by checking the appropriate position of the FOV, the absence of wraparound (aliasing) artifacts, and the efficient suppression of fat signals.\nImaging pulse sequence\nAfter the preparations described above, acquire high-resolution 3D T2W images of the mouse’s whole brain, using a rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) sequence.",
    "NOTE: In this article, MRI experiments were conducted on a 7 T, 210 mm horizontal bore, preclinical scanner, equipped with a gradient system of 440 mT/m at ramp time 100 μs. A quadrature volume resonator with an inner diameter of 35 mm was used for RF excitation and signal reception. MRI data were acquired with a dedicated operation software. The acquisition parameters of the 3D RARE pulse sequence used in this study are summarized in Table 1.\n4. Preparation of Experimental Solutions (Day 2)\nPrepare 500 mL of an ice-cold cutting solution (2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 7 mM MgCl2, 15 mM glucose, 25 mM NaHCO3, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 11.6 mM sodium ascorbate, 3.1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 100 mM choline chloride, bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2). Adjust the pH to 7.3−7.4.\nPrepare 1 L of the artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; 127 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 1 mM MgCl2, 15 mM glucose, 25 mM NaHCO3, and 2 mM CaCl2, bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2). Adjust the pH to 7.3–7.4.\n5. Preparation of Equipment (Day 2)\nPrepare a 6.6 cm2 square, 0.5 cm thick magnet “ring” and, first, place black tape and, second, surgical tape on the ring (Figure 1c-2). Note that this material is named a brain-block base (BBB), and keep it cold on blocks of ice.\nNOTE: Later, the tapes will be attached to the slicing station with brain blocks for the vibratome. The square ring is used as the bottom base of the BBB to satisfy two purposes, namely to migrate brain blocks smoothly from the 3D scan station to a vibratome and to measure accurately the heights of the brain blocks in the scanning step.",
    "Set up the BBB with an automatic turntable. Turn on the scanner and the turntable. Start the image processing software.\nPreceding all experiments, perform calibrations of the cameras and the connected turntable of a structured light projection and desktop-type 3D scanner.\nTurn on the center projector, the two cameras, and the turntable. Then, open the software. In the software, click Optical setup and select the image area as 100 x 80 and the grid numbers as 100 x 100. Then, the camera calibration starts according to the following four steps.\n\t\t\nFor the projector setup, lay the calibration sheet on the desk and put the calibration board on the calibration sheet to adjust the fixing point of the measuring area to the center of the sheet and the orientation to the front. Adjust the distance between the projector and the board to around 200 mm. Loosen the screws fixing the two knobs, and rotate the knobs to adjust the light sensitivity and the focus of the two cameras. Then, click Arrow to go to the next step.\nTo orientate the cameras, loosen the screws fixing the two cameras themselves and move the positions and the rotations to overlap with the center line on the calibration board, the vertical line, and the yellow cross projected from the projector. Fix the cameras, and click Arrow again. Then, the screen will become dark.\nTo focus the cameras, after loosening the fixing screws of the knobs, increase the light sensitivity and tune the focus again. Then, click Arrow to go to the next step.",
    "For the F value and the degree of exposure (of the camera), adjust the light sensitivity again to just below where the red region disappears. Then, click Arrow again, and click Calibration start, and choose Yes if asked Did you finish the optical setting?\nClick Initialize the calibration, and check if the pixel values are normalized between 0–255. Then, click Continue.\nBy following suggested positions, record images of nine different relative angles of the scanner and the calibration board, and finish after confirming the calibration process, and, finally, click Update of the calibration.\nExchange the calibration board for the turntable, and click the Turntable calibration.\nNOTE: Now, all calibrations are finished.\n6. Brain Surface Scan, Slicing, and MEA Recording (Day 2)\nAnesthetize a mouse with 1%−1.5% isoflurane and decapitate the mouse. Use a scalpel to open the skin and expose the skull.\nCut the scalp of the anesthetized mouse along the sagittal suture using a surgical knife, and cut the skull in diagonal directions from the lambda point to a point a little in front of the bregma using surgical scissors. Then, gently peel off the skull from the brain using curved tweezers.\nUse a spatula to lift the brain and transfer it to a Petri dish (100 mm x 20 mm) with ice-cold cutting solution (prepared in step 4.1). Flow air containing 95% O2 and 5% CO2 from an external gas bomb with a controlled rotating speed of the pump (~4.0 rpm) to generate small bubbles in the ice-cold cutting solution (Figure 1a).\nAfter 1–2 min, put the brain on a microfiber cloth whose surface is slightly covered by a flour sieve, and wipe fluid from the brain surface, gently using the microfiber cloth (Figure 1b).",
    "Put the brain with its dorsal aspect up on the sample stand on the BBB, and also put the BBB at the center of the automatic turntable.\nDarken the room during the 3D scan and perform a 3D scan on the turntable. To test whether the 3D scan works well, click 3D scan by selecting the angle between two shots as 22.5, the starting angle as 0, and the final angle as 360 (Figure 1c-1).\nMove the brain to a Petri dish, and bubble the brain in the cutting solution for approximately 10 s.\nCut the brain into two blocks at the middle of the coronal plane using a surgical knife, and move the two brain blocks gently to the flat surface using a surgical spatula.\nAttach the brain blocks of the BBB using instant glue, and softly and carefully wipe the fluid from the brain surface within 1–2 min, using a microfiber cloth again. Then, perform a 3D scan again (Figure 1c-2).\nAttach the black tape covering the center of the BBB to the center of the cutting stage for a vibratome (Figure 1d).\nPour cutting solution into the cutting stage and set the cutting stage on the vibratome. Adjust the cutting speed and amplitude. Make 2–5 coronal slices (300 µm thick) from the two brain blocks. Keep the solution in the cutting stage bubbling if possible (Figure 1e).\nAttach a blade to the blade holder of the vibratome and optimize the cutting speed, frequency, and vibration amplitude of the system by setting them as 12.7 mm/min for the speed, 87–88 Hz for the frequency, and 0.8–1.0 mm for the swing width. When careful cutting is necessary, slow down the speed to level 2–3.",
    "While cutting the brain slices, record the sliced coordinate in the format, including the anterior-posterior coordinate, hemisphere, and other conditions (Figure 2c).\nGently transfer the brain slices to a beaker filled with prewarmed (~34 °C) ACSF using a thick plastic pipette, and incubate them in the beaker at ~34 °C for ~1 h. During this time, perform a 3D scan of the remaining brain blocks on the cutting stage (Figure 1c-2).\nSet an MEA chip on a recording unit. Connect the chip to a peristaltic pump using two tubes. Use one tube to guide the same ACSF into the MEA chip and the other tube to guide ACSF out of the MEA chip.\nAttach two needles (0.60 mm x 19 mm), connected at the tips of the two tubes, to the top of the wall of the MEA chip, and fix their positions with their tips following the inner wall of the MEA chip. Set the flow rate of the ACSF to 4.1 rpm.\nAfter 1 h has passed, move a slice on the chip using a thick plastic pipette, and set the position using a soft brush. Then, start the recording process of neuronal activities (Figure 2-d).\n7. Immunohistochemistry Staining (Days 3 and 4)\nAfter the MEA recording is finished, transfer the slices to 1.5 mL tubes filled with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Incubate them overnight at 4 °C. Then, remove the 4% PFA solution, and wash the slices 3x with PBS for 5 min in total.\nNOTE: If necessary, embed the slices in 20% gelatin/PBS and resection the slice to make it thinner than 50 µm, using the vibratome.\nPrepare antigen retrieval solution (10 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.0). Remove the PBS from the last wash and add the antigen retrieval solution.",
    "Boil water in an electric thermos pot and incubate the tubes with the slices for 20 min at ~95–98 °C in the pot, followed by natural cooling.\nPrepare 50 mM Tris-buffered saline and add 1% Na bisulfite (1% Na bisulfite-Tris solution). Adjust the pH to 7.5. Then, wash the slices with 1% Na bisulfite-Tris solution for 5 min at room temperature (~20–25 °C).\nPrepare blocking solution by adding 4% normal goat serum and 0.5% octylphenol ethoxylate to the 1% Na bisulfite-Tris solution.\nRemove the 1% Na bisulfite-Tris solution from the tubes with the slices and add blocking solution. Incubate for 2 h at room temperature.\nPrepare the primary antibody solution by adding 1% normal goat serum and 0.5% Triton X-100 to the 1% Na bisulfite-Tris solution and diluting primary antibodies. Use the following concentrations of primary antibodies: 1:800 of mouse anti-GAD67 and 1:500 of rabbit anti-NeuN.\nRemove the 1% Na bisulfite-Tris solution from the tubes with the slices and add the primary antibody solution. Incubate it overnight at 4 °C.\nPrepare 50 mM Tris-buffered saline and add 8.5 g/L NaCl (Tris-NaCl solution). Titrate the pH to 7.5. Then, wash the slices 3x with the Tris-NaCl solution (~20–25 °C) for 5 min in total.\nPrepare the second antibody solution by adding 3% normal goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 to the Tris-NaCl solution and diluting secondary antibodies. Use the following concentrations of secondary antibodies: 1:500 of goat anti-mouse and 1:500 of goat anti-rabbit.\nRemove the Tris-NaCl solution from the tubes with the slices and add the secondary antibody solution. Incubate it for 2 h at room temperature. Then, wash the slices 3x with the Tris-NaCl solution for 5 min in total.",
    "Place the slices on the slide using a small brush and apply mounting media and a coverslip. Examine the slides with a confocal microscope. Take images of the surface of a slice (Figure 2e).\n8. MRI Data Processing to Extract Cortical Volumes\nInstall the free software FSL (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation). Prepare the MRI images acquired in section 3.\nChange the image format using the fslchfiletype NIFTI_PAIR_GZ command. Expand the brain image to make it as big as a human brain using the fslcreatehd command, and, if necessary, change the orientation using fslorient with the option -setqformcode 1. After this, recover the original file format using fslchfiletype NIFTI_GZ. The exact command is as follows.\n\tfslchfiletype NFTI_PAIR [input image].nii.gz\n\tfslcreatehd 144 196 160 1 0.95 0.6 1.15 0 0 0 0 4 [input image].hdr.gz\n\tfslorient –setqformmcode 1 [input image].hdr.gz\n\tfslchfiletype NIFTI_GZ [input image]\nType fsl to open the FSL software. Extract brains using the bet command from the graphical user interface (GUI), but do not peel too much. Then, control the Fractional intensity thresholds, ... and Coordinates of centre of initial brain surface sphere carefully. The optimal values are different for individual data.\nResize the brain image to the original mouse brain size, using the same procedure as in step 8.2. The exact command is as follow:\n\tfslchfiletype NFTI_PAIR [input image].nii.gz\n\tfslcreatehd 144 196 180 1 0.1 0.1 0.08 0 0 0 0 4 [input image].hdr.gz\n\tfslorient –setqformmcode 1 [input image].hdr.gz\n\tfslchfiletype NIFTI_GZ [input image]\nCoregistrate all brain images using the flirt command, and produce an averaged brain image using the -add option and the -div option of the fslmaths command.\n\tfslmaths [brain image 1] –add … –add [brain image N] –div N [averaged image name] –odt float",
    "Make the averaged brain cleaner using the -thr option of the fslmaths command. Then, select an optimal threshold value adaptive to individual cases.\n\tfslmaths [averaged image name] –thr [thr value, for example, 5000] [thresholded average image]\nFinally, reshape the averaged brain image into an individual’s coordinate using the flirt command again. Then, prepare fairly clean extracted cortexes (Figure 2a).\n\tNOTE: Unfortunately, the olfactory bulb and cerebellum will not be perfect in the reconstructed brain surface from the MRI volumes because of the FSL software’s essential limitations to peal all brain parts including olfactory bulb and cerebellum.\n9. MRI Image Processing to Stripe Cortical Surfaces\nDownload another free software, 3D Slicer (https://download.slicer.org/).\nOpen the MR images of the extracted brains (click File and select Add data) produced according to section 8, using the Volume Rendering and Editor modules in 3D Slicer.\nChange the mode from Editor to Volume rendering, and click a target button to make the image of the brain come to the center of the screen.\nSelect the MR-T2-brain mode and tune the threshold by moving the Shift bar. Then, move back from Volume rendering to Editor and click the Threshold effect button.\nApply the Label 41. Cerebral cortex and save the brain surface data as a .stl file. Then, change the file format from .vtk to .stl, and save the file by checking the form.\n10. Preprocessing for 3D Scan Data\nPerform an automatic coregistration among 8 or 16 images taken from 8 or 16 different angles within a sequence of a scan to correct small mismatches among them by clicking Global registration included in the Alignment option, and integrate them. Repeat scans from different angles to obtain the whole-brain surface (Figure 2b).",
    "If the integration among images scanned from different angles was not successful, click Manual alignment and select a pair of a Fixed image and a Moving image.\nClick Start to start the manual alignment of the images by selecting three or four common points in different images. Then, click OK. The optimization algorithm is the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm10. It does not include a nonlinear deformation.\nMake a mesh of all the aligned images (i.e., of the dots data sets) by selecting all images and by clicking the Mesh generation button. Then, select the option Small artistic object to get the mesh as the highest resolution. Then, save the image as .stl binary, or in ASCII format.\n11. Coregistration of the MRI Surface and the 3D Scan Surface\nOpen the MRI surface and merge it with the 3D scan surface using the surface processing software. Then, perform a manual alignment process using the same procedure as described in steps 10.1.1 and 10.1.2. Then, save these coregistered surface images again (Figure 2a,b).\nIf necessary, clean the individual surface data, for example, by erasing small noises surrounding the brain region, especially in the case of the MRI data, and by filling holes if any exist, especially in the case of the 3D scan data.\nFinally, open the surface data with a data analysis software, for example, MATLAB, and perform and evaluate the histograms of the minimum distances between the two surfaces.\nSubscription Required.
