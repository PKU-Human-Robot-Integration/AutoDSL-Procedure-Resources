    "1. Microfluidic chamber preparation\nSelect a SU-8 master mold with several chamber patterns. Typical chambers are cross-shaped with three inlets and one outlet, 20 µm high and 800 µm wide (Figure 1). Such master molds can be purchased from external companies or made in academic laboratories (e.g., Gicquel, Y. et al.5).\nPlace tape around the edge of the mold.\n\t\nPut ~50 cm long, 19 mm wide, standard transparent office tape (see Table of Materials) on a bench, sticky side up. Place the mold vertically at one end and along the midline of the tape.\nRoll the mold to the other end of the tape to create a 1 cm border around the mold. Fold down the tape over the bottom of the mold.\nPrepare Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) solution.\n\t\nIn a disposable weighing dish, directly pour 25-30 g of PDMS base (Table of Materials). Add 10% weight/weight PDMS curing agent (Table of Materials) with a disposable plastic Pasteur pipette.\nMix manually and thoroughly with a plastic stick. Ensure that the curing agent is well incorporated into the PDMS base, even if stirring creates lots of bubbles.\nDegas the PDMS solution in a vacuum desiccator (Table of Materials) for at least 5 min at room temperature (RT). Bubbles will expand, rise to the surface, and burst when the vacuum is broken.\nPour the PDMS solution over the SU-8 mold. Use a plastic stick to scrape and transfer as much of the mixture as possible.\nDegas PDMS for a second time (5 min in the vacuum desiccator). Make sure to get rid of most bubbles (a few small bubbles at the top surface are fine).\nPlace the mold in an oven at 70 °C for at least 5 h for the PDMS to reticulate and solidify.\nRemove solid PDMS chambers from the mold.",
    "CAUTION: Silicon wafers for SU-8 molds are extremely fragile, so extensive care must be taken when separating the PDMS from wafers. Work on a hard, flat surface and keep the wafer flat on the surface.\n\t\nWith a razor blade, make a circular cut in the PDMS, about 1 cm away from the edge of the mold. All patterns must be at least 0.5 cm inside the cut. Gently peel off the central PDMS block with gentle tugs.\n\t\tCAUTION: When peeling off, maintain the SU-8 mold flat on the benchtop to prevent breaking it.\nPlace PDMS on clean aluminum foil, the molded surface facing the aluminum foil, to protect its surface from dust and to make patterns more visible.\nChoose and cut a chamber with a razor blade at least 0.5 cm away from the pattern. The resulting PDMS block is around 0.5 cm high, 1.5 cm wide, and 3 cm long. Pierce three inlets and one outlet with a biopsy punch 0.75 mm I.D. (Table of Materials).\nClean the PDMS chamber with ultrapure ethanol (Table of Materials) and air-dry using a safety blowgun (Table of Materials). Place the PDMS with the pattern facing up in a clean Petri dish, and close the dish with its lid.\n2. Glass coverslip cleaning\nNOTE: Here, a standard coverslip cleaning procedure, based on a series of sonication steps, is detailed. Other glass coverslip-cleaning procedures have been described in many other publications that can achieve similar satisfying results6,7,8,9.\nPlace 10-20 coverslips (40 mm long) on a Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) holder (Table of Materials). Sonicate the coverslips in 0.5 L of 2% glass cleaning solution (Table of Materials) in a 1 L glass beaker (35 °C, 30 min).",
    "Dispose the glass cleaning solution and rinse the coverslips extensively with dH2O in at least three successive 0.5 L baths.\nPrepare 0.5 L of 2 M KOH in a 1 L glass beaker. Sonicate the coverslips in KOH (RT, 30 min). Dispose KOH and rinse the coverslips with dH2O in at least three 0.5 L baths.\n\tCAUTION: Use appropriate lab safety protection equipment (gloves, glasses, and lab coat).\nTransfer and sonicate the coverslips in 0.5 L of ultrapure ethanol (RT, 30 min). Coverslips can be kept in ethanol for up to 2 weeks. Close the beaker with thermoplastic film (Table of Materials) to prevent evaporation. Before use, dry the coverslip with air flow.\n3. PDMS chamber assembly\nPreheat the hot plate to 100 °C. Place up to three cleaned PDMS chambers and glass coverslips in a clean Petri dish. Place the open Petri dish in a deep Ultraviolet (UV) cleaner (λ = 185 nm, see Table of Materials) and expose it to UV light for 3-5 min.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, PDMS chambers and coverslips can be exposed to air or oxygen plasma for 30 s.\nGently position the PDMS chamber over the coverslip. Make sure the two surfaces put in contact were directly exposed to UV. The PDMS automatically sticks to the glass and the chamber becomes clearly visible.\nTo remove any air trapped at the PDMS-coverslip interface, very gently press the surface with a finger. For a tighter bonding, press more strongly over corners and sides. Make sure that the ceiling of the chamber does not come in contact with the glass surface.",
    "Place the chamber with the glass bottom facing the hot plate at 100 °C for 5 min. After this step, the glass-PDMS bonds become permanent, and chambers can only be used once. Use the chamber immediately or store it in a clean Petri dish for up to a week.\n4. [OPTIONAL] Direct passivation and functionalization\nNOTE: Depending on the application, chambers can be passivated and functionalized either once connected to the microfluidic controlling device (see Table of Materials) or by manually injecting solutions directly into the chamber with a pipette prior to its connection to the microfluidic device. The latter offers the advantage of consuming less reagent and avoiding potential contamination by flowing the solution through the polyether ether ketone (PEEK) tubing of the microfluidic device. In all the following steps, solutions are injected by directly sticking the pipette tip into the outlet. In order to avoid creating bubbles inside the chamber, make sure to have a tiny droplet sticking out of the pipette tip when plugging the tip into the outlet of the PDMS chamber. Likewise, remove the pipette tip before the entire volume has been injected.\nInject 20 µL of PLL-PEG (1 mg/mL in Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)). Incubate for a minimum of 1 h (or overnight) at RT. To prevent evaporation, place the PDMS chamber in a humid box (e.g., an empty tip box with water in the lower compartment and the PDMS chamber on the tip-holding platform).\nInject 20 µL of 100 pM spectrin-actin seeds (in F-buffer, see Table 1 and Table 2). Wait for no more than 1 min. Adjust the seed concentration and timing to tune seed surface density, high enough for large statistics and low enough for filaments not to overlap.",
    "NOTE: Alternatively, if spectrin-actin seeds are not available, use biotin-functionalized short filament segments that will be immobilized on a streptavidin-coated coverslip9,10.\n[OPTIONAL] Inject 20 µL of 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in F-buffer. Leave at RT for 10 min.\n[OPTIONAL] Inject 20 µL of 1 mg/mL β-casein in F-buffer. Leave at RT for 10 min.\n\tNOTE: Follow steps 4.3 and/or 4.4 to further passivate the chamber. The choice of passivation depends on the proteins used and does not work equally well on all ABPs. When using actin alone, PLL-PEG or BSA is sufficient.\n5. Connect microfluidic device\nNOTE: Use a pressure-based microfluidic system with up to four channels to control flows in the microfluidic chamber (Figure 1A, see Table of Materials). To avoid bubbles forming in the microfluidic tubing and perturbing flow stability, degas all solutions. Place 5 mL of dH20 and 10 mL of F-buffer stock in a vacuum desiccator connected to a vacuum pump (ultimate vacuum <250 mbar) and degas for at least 1 h at RT.\nRinse inlets + outlet tubings with dH2O (500 µL, 300 mbar).\nFill all 2 mL reservoir tubes (see Table of Materials) with 300 µL of F-buffer. Set pressure to 300 mbar and let five to eight drops go to waste. Repeat for each channel and set pressure to 0.\nConnect the outlet and rinse the chamber extensively.\n\t\nSet the pressure for the reservoir tube 4 (outlet) to 50 mbar. Once a droplet comes out from the tubing end, connect the tubing to the outlet of the PDMS chamber. The liquid fills in the chamber and comes out of all inlets.",
    "[OPTIONAL] If the chamber has been directly passivated (section 4), set pressure to 100 mbar to rinse the chamber with 50-100 µL of F-buffer (3-5 min). Remove the excess liquid at inlets with a cleaning tissue.\nSet pressure to 20 mbar.\nConnect inlets.\n\t\nSet the pressure for the reservoir tube 1 to 50 mbar. To avoid introducing air bubbles, ensure that a droplet comes out of the tubing and the PDMS inlet.\nConnect the tubing to inlet 1 (the two droplets merging when connecting). Set the pressure to 30 mbar.\nRepeat steps 5.4.1-5.4.2 to connect inlets 2 and 3.\nSet the pressure of all inlets to 20 mbar and the outlet pressure to 0 mbar. Ensure that the flow rates in the inlets are roughly equal (see Troubleshooting section).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63891/63891fig1v2.jpg",
    "Figure 1: Injecting solutions through a microfluidic chamber. (A) Standard microfluidic setup for single actin filaments experiments. Protein solutions, placed in reservoirs 1-3, are pushed into the chamber by adjusting the pressure in the gas phase. The generated flow rates are measured by flow meters. Inside the microfluidic chambers, solutions do not mix and occupy space depending on the relative pressures applied (here, equal pressure on all inlets). Typical dimensions: reservoir tubes contain up to 2 mL of solution. PEEK tubing (0.25 mm inner diameter) connects the reservoirs to the flow meters (after 10 cm of tubing) and then to the PDMS chamber (after another 70 cm). Silicon tubing and stainless steel tubing couplers are used to connect the PEEK tubing to the PDMS inlets. The main microfluidic channel is 20-60 µm high, around 1 mm wide and 1 cm long. (B,C) Flow profiles inside the microfluidic chamber. (B) The fluid generates a parabolic profile across the chamber height: v(z) = 6z(h-z)R/h3w, where h and w are the chamber height and width, and R is the total flow rate. Bottom: Single actin filament polymerized from surface-anchored spectrin-actin seeds. (C) When the chamber width is considerably larger than its height, the flow is nearly uniform across the chamber, except at the PDMS surfaces, where it goes to zero. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63891/63891fig1v2large.jpg]\n6. Configuring the setup with standard flow rates",
    "NOTE: The computer-controlled pressure system allows easy and precise adjustment of the pressures of all inlets/outlet connected to the PDMS chamber, therefore the control of incoming and outcoming flow rates. Preset configurations can be saved and turned on/off with a single mouse click. Below are the recommended configurations (unless otherwise stated, outlet pressure is set to 0 mbar). See Table 3 for expected flow rates for these preset configurations. The pressures indicated here must be adjusted depending on the chamber geometry and system configuration.\nChange: Use this preset when changing one or more reservoir(s). It creates a mild backward flow in the tubing of interest to prevent introducing bubbles.\n\t\nSet all inlet pressures to 12 mbar and outlet pressure to 5 mbar (Figure 2B).\nHigh Flow 'All': Use this preset to rapidly inject three solutions in parallel. They will reach the chamber within 4 min.\n\t\nSet all inlet pressures to 150 mbar.\nHigh Flow 'x': Use this preset to rapidly inject a solution. It will reach the chamber within 3 min (Figure 3A-C).\n\t\nSet inlet 'x' pressure to 150 mbar (~15 µL/min). The pressure in the other inlets is adjusted to around 100 mbar, such that the resulting flow rate in these inlets is ~500 nL/min.\nMid Flow 'All': Use this preset to pause the system.\n\t\nSet all inlets to 20 mbar (Figure 2A).\nMid Flow 'x': Use this preset to allow the solution 'x' to fill in most of the main channel width (see Figure 2C,D), while restricting the other inlet solutions to the channel sides. Actin filaments in the chamber will thus be exposed to the biochemical condition imposed by solution 'x' only.",
    "Set inlet 'x' pressure to 12 mbar. Set the pressure in the other inlets and adjust to ~9 mbar, such that their respective flow rates are ~ 150 nL/min.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63891/63891fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: The pressure applied to each reservoir controls the partition/spatial distribution of solutions inside the microfluidic chamber. (A) With equal pressure applied to the reservoirs, each solution occupies one-third of the chamber. (B) When changing a reservoir tube (here reservoir 3), the effective pressure drops down to zero, creating a backward flow. (C,D) Increasing the relative pressure on one of the reservoirs allows exposure of the glass surface to a single solution. The field of view in the middle of the chamber can be sequentially exposed to solutions 1 and 2 by alternating between configuration Mid Flow 1 (C) and Mid Flow 2 (D). Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63891/63891fig02large.jpg]\n7. Changing solution 'x'\nNOTE: As shown in Figure 3A-C, it is important to keep in mind that solutions take minutes to flow from a reservoir tube to the main channel of the chamber. This minimal 'dead' time is imposed by the liquid volume contained in the tubing and the flow profile within the tubing (Figure 3A-C).\nPrepare 200-300 µL of solution in a new reservoir tube. Set pressure to Change setting (see section 6).\nUnscrew the reservoir tube of inlet 'x'. The solution in the tubing will slowly flow backwards, from the chamber to the free tubing tip. The measured flow rate becomes negative (Figure 2B).\nOnce a tiny droplet has formed at the tubing tip, screw in the new tube with the fresh solution. Once the tube is correctly tightened to the pressure system, the flow rate of the inlet returns to positive.\nSet the pressure setting to High Flow 'x'.",
    "Depending on the microfluidic configuration and chamber geometry, wait for 3-5 min for the solution to fully fill in the tubing and reach the chamber.\n[OPTIONAL] Follow this process by measuring the increase in fluorescence over time (Figure 3C).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63891/63891fig03.jpg",
    "Figure 3: Delayed arrival of solutions from the reservoirs to the PDMS chamber and rapid change of biochemical conditions. (A-C) Delayed arrival of solutions from the reservoirs to the PDMS chamber. (A) Depending on the chamber geometry, the tube length, and the applied pressure at the inlet(s), the replacement of one solution by another is not instantaneous. After changing the reservoir tube to one containing a fluorescent solution (0 min), the solution progressively fills in the tubing (0.4 min) and the PDMS chamber (1-2 min). Indicative timing is given for a 150 mbar applied pressure, 80 cm PEEK tubing, and a 1600 µm wide, 20 µm high PDMS chamber. (B) The parabolic flow profile inside the PEEK tubing generates an effective gradient of fluorescence along the tubing radial profile and inside the chamber (see also Figure 1B). (C) Delayed arrival of solutions can be quantified by measuring the background epifluorescence signal in the chamber as a function of time. Experimental conditions: 0.5 µM 10% Alexa-568-labeled G-actin is injected with 150 mbar through a flow meter and 80 cm PEEK tubing. (D,E) Rapid change of biochemical conditions. (D) Pattern of incoming solutions in two Mid Flow conditions. (E) Increase in background fluorescence as a readout of actin concentration. Time t = 0 is set as the onset of fluorescence increase. Solution 1: 0.5 µM 10% Alexa-488-labeled G-actin, solution 2: F-buffer. (C,E) PDMS chamber: 20 µm high and 1600 µm wide. The epifluorescence intensity, ~2 µm above the surface, was quantified by averaging the signal over the full field of view, normalized to 0 in the absence of fluorophore and 1 at maximum intensity.

Basic single filament experiment: Adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-actin barbed end depolymerization",
    "NOTE: This section assumes a non-functionalized chamber (section 5 only). If the chamber has been directly functionalized (section 4), start at step 8.4.\nSurface functionalization with actin filament seeds:\n\t\nChange solution 3 to 200 µL of 50 pM spectrin-actin seeds11 in F-buffer (see section 7).\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, if spectrin-actin seeds are not available, one can use biotin-functionalized short filament segments that will be immobilized on a streptavidin-coated coverslip (refer to9,10 for details).\nInject for 2 min with High Flow 3.\n\t\tNOTE: Adjust the concentration and time depending on the final seed density.\nSurface passivation:\n\t\nChange tube 3 with 300 µL of 5% BSA in F-buffer.\nInject for 5 min at High Flow 3, followed by 5 min at Mid Flow 3. During this second step, reduce pressure in channels 1 and 2 to 7-8 mbar to get a counter flow ~-100 nL/min, so that the entire chamber surfaces are BSA passivated.\n\t\tNOTE: Since the BSA solution is more viscous, the pressures need to be adjusted accordingly.\nChange tube 3 to F-buffer and rinse the channel (5 min, High Flow 3).\nPrepare the following 200-300 µL solutions, all proteins being diluted in F-buffer:\n\tInlet 1, polymerization solution: 1 µM 10% Alexa-488 labeled G-actin, 1 µM profilin (Table 1).\n\tInlet 2, aging solution: 0.15 µM 10% Alexa-488 labeled G-actin.\n\tInlet 3, depolymerization solution: F-buffer only.\n\tNOTE: Profilin is used here to prevent spontaneous nucleation and to maintain a constant concentration of G-actin.\nChange tubes 1 to 3 (section 7). Inject using the High Flow All preset for 3-4 min. The three solutions have now filled the PEEK tubing and reached the chamber (Figure 3A). The glass surface can be exposed to any inlet solution without deadtime (<1 s, Figure 3D,E).",
    "Switch on the microscope. Set the settings: 150 mW 488 nm excitation laser at 10%-20% power, 100-200 ms camera exposure time, 200-300 nm TIRF penetration depth, 60x objective. These settings are used throughout the manuscript.\nFilament polymerization (Figure 4A):\n\t\nSet the pressure setting to Mid Flow 1 for ~10 min.\n[OPTIONAL] Record polymerization (1 frame/20 s, TIRF). Filaments should polymerize at around 10 subunits/second (sub/s)1,12.\nFilament aging: Set the pressure setting to Mid Flow 2 for 15 min. At the critical concentration, 0.15 µM G-actin, filament length will remain constant, and filaments will turn to >99% ADP-F-actin4.\nDepolymerization (Figure 4A):\n\t\nStart acquisition at 1 frame/5 s, in epifluorescence mode. As there is a very low fluorescence background in channels 2 and 3, it is not necessary to use TIRF.\nAfter one to two frames, switch to Mid Flow 3. Filaments should depolymerize at around 10 sub/s (reference12).\nTo reset the experiment, break all fluorescently labeled filaments by continuously exposing them to the laser at maximum power for ~2 min. To test different conditions, change solutions 1, 2, or 3 and inject them (High Flow, 3-4 min). Repeat steps 8.7-8.9.\n9. Other single-filament experiments\nTesting the interactions of ABPs with F-actin\n\tNOTE: Microfluidics has been successfully used to quantify the activity of several side-binding ABPs, such as cofilin, tropomyosin, and Arp2/3. Following the protocol in section 8:\n\t\nChange channel 3 to the fluorescent ABP of interest in F-buffer. Inject (High Flow 3, 3 min).\nFilament polymerization: Set the pressure setting to Mid Flow 1 for 10 min.\nABP binding: Start acquisition with TIRF. Adjust frame rate depending on the ABP concentration. After 1-2 frames, switch to Mid Flow 3.",
    "NOTE: Depending on the ABP, it can also be possible to rapidly (e.g., for less than 5 s) switch to Mid Flow 2 to further reduce the background fluorescence when taking an image.\nABP unbinding: While continuing the acquisition, switch to Mid Flow 2.\nPolymerization with formin at the free barbed end\n\tNOTE: Formins have been shown to affect filament barbed end polymerization. Microfluidics is particularly adapted to measure formin binding and unbinding rates and their impact on filament elongation.\n\t\nPrepare the following solutions:\n\t\tChannel 1: 10 nM formin in F-buffer (Table 1).\n\t\tChannel 2: 1 µM 10% Alexa-488 labeled G-actin, 4 µM profilin.\n\t\tChannel 3: F-buffer.\nChange tubes 1, 2, and 3 (section 7).

With formin mDia1 at their barbed end, filaments should polymerize at around 50 sub/s13,14,15.\nPolymerization/depolymerization from surface-anchored formin\n\tNOTE: The polymerization and depolymerization rates of formin-decorated barbed ends have been shown to depend on the tension applied to the filament. In microfluidics, the friction of the fluid flow along the filament side generates a tension proportional to the filament length and to the flow rate14,16.\n\t\nUse the method in section 8 described above, replacing steps 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3 for surface passivation with:\n\t\t\nChange tube 3 to 1 µg/mL anti-His antibody in F-buffer. Inject for 2 min with High Flow 3.",
    "Change tube 3 with 5% BSA in F-buffer. Inject for 5 min at High Flow 3, followed by 5 min at Mid Flow 3. During this second step, reduce pressure in channels 1 and 2 to 7-8 mbar to get a counter flow ~-100 nL/min so that the entire chamber surfaces are BSA passivated.\nChange tube 3 to 100 nM His-tagged formin in F-buffer. Inject for 5 min with High Flow 3. Change tube 3 with F-buffer. Inject for 5 min with High Flow 3 to ensure that no formins remain in the tubing.\nPrepare and inject the following solutions (200-300 µL each, in F-buffer):\n\t\tChannel 1: 1 µM 10% Alexa-488 labeled G-actin.\n\t\tChannel 2: 1 µM unlabeled G-actin, 4 µM profilin.\n\t\tChannel 3: F-buffer only.\nFilament nucleation: Expose the surface-anchored formins to G-actin (setting Mid Flow 1).\nFilament polymerization: Expose the chamber to profilin-actin using Mid Flow 2.\nStart acquisition: 1 frame/2 s, epifluorescence. With formin mDia1, filaments should polymerize at 50-80 sub/s, depending on the filament length and the flow rate14.\nFilament depolymerization: Start acquisition (1 frame/4 s, epifluorescence). After 1-2 frames, expose the filaments to F-buffer, Mid Flow 3. With formin mDia1, filaments should depolymerize at 5-15 sub/s, depending on the filament length and flow rate14.\nActin filaments with unlabeled segments\n\tNOTE: Actin fluorescent labeling creates several artifacts, such as pauses during depolymerization17 and altered tropomyosin binding18. A workaround for these artifacts is to use microfluidics to assemble filaments displaying unlabeled segments.\n\t\nPrepare and inject the following solutions (200-300 µL in F-buffer):\n\t\tChannel 1: 1 µM unlabeled G-actin, 1 µM profilin.\n\t\tChannel 2: 0.3 µM 10% Alexa-488 labeled G-actin.",
    "Sequentially expose the surface to channel 2 (5 min), channel 1 (10 min), and channel 2 (15 min) to generate ADP-actin unlabeled segments with fluorescently labeled segments at each end.\nBarbed end-anchored filaments with gelsolin\n\tNOTE: With spectrin-actin seeds, filaments polymerize at their free barbed end while the pointed end is stabilized by the spectrin-actin seed. An alternative is to anchor filaments with a barbed end capper such as gelsolin.\n\t\nPrepare a F-actin solution of 4 µM 10% Alexa-488 labeled G-actin in 20 µL of F-buffer. Let the actin spontaneously nucleate and polymerize at RT for at least 30 min on the bench. Wrap the tube in aluminum foil to protect it from light.\nMeanwhile, prepare the microfluidic chamber and passivate the surface with a mixture of 5% BSA and 1% biotin-BSA (see step 8.2).\nRinse channel 3 with F-buffer (2 min at High Flow 3).

    "NOTE: To form actin filament bundles, make sure to have a sufficiently high filament seed density at the surface of the chamber. When exposed to fascin protein, neighboring filaments that fluctuate laterally will be dynamically cross-linked by fascin proteins. As fascin quickly unbinds from the filament side19, fascin has to be constantly present in the main flowing solution in order to maintain filament bundling.\nFollow steps 8.1-8.3.\nPrepare the following solutions (200-300 µL in F-buffer):\n\tChannel 1, polymerization solution: 1 µM 10% Alexa-488 labeled G-actin, 1 µM profilin.\n\tChannel 2, Bundling solution: 200 nM fascin (Table 1), 0.15 µM 10% Alexa-488 labeled G-actin.\n\tChannel 3, Disassembly solution: 200 nM ADF/cofilin (Table 1), 100 nM fascin, 0.15 µM 10% Alexa-488 labeled G-actin.\nChange tubes 1 to 3 (section 7).

Microfluidic device cleaning procedure\nNOTE: To avoid any contamination from one experiment to another, it is critical to extensively clean and completely dry all the tubings and flow meters after each experiment.\nDisconnect all tubings from the PDMS chamber and discard the chamber.\nTo clean PEEK tubing and flow meters, tape the tubing ends in an empty 15 mL plastic tube and inject the following solutions at maximum pressure until the reservoir is almost empty:\n\t400 µL of F-buffer.\n\t400 µL of 0.5 M NaOH.",
    "400 µL of pure water.\n\t200 µL of isopropanol.\nReplace with an empty reservoir and blow air until the tubings are fully dry (~2-4 min, maximum pressure).\n12. Image analysis\nNOTE: While this manuscript focuses on the method to assemble, manipulate, and visualize single actin filaments in microfluidics, a brief method to analyze acquired movies is provided here. The analysis is performed on 16-bit images, using ImageJ, following section 8.\nImage treatment is minimal:\n\t\nImport the polymerization or depolymerization image stack.\n[OPTIONAL] Homogenize image intensity with function Subtract Background (default settings (i.e. 'Rolling ball radius' = 50 pixels)). This is particularly useful if the background fluorescence changes during the course of a movie or if fluorescence illumination is not homogeneous over the field of view.\nAdjust brightness and contrast (background near zero, filaments near maximum).\nCreate filament kymograph:\n\t\nSelect a filament that does not pause, break or detach. Do not select based on behavior otherwise. Draw a line 1-2 pixels above (Straight Line tool). Save the filament number (Add in ROI Manager).\nApply the function Reslice (Slice count: 5 pixels). Calculate the maximum intensity (function Zprojection).\nMeasure the polymerization/depolymerization rate:\n\t\nOn the kymograph, draw a line along the filament barbed end (Straight Line tool, Figure 4A). Measure the line width and height (function Measure).\nRepeat steps 12.2-12.3 over multiple filaments. Calculate the polymerization/depolymerization rates (Figure 4A):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63891/63891eq01.jpg, where v is the rate (in sub/s), w the line width (pixels), pix the pixel size (nm), h the line height (frames), and dt the time between frames (in second). Here, 2.7 nm corresponds to the effective contribution of an actin subunit to the filament length.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
