    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nHere, we describe protocols for the isolation of human and murine HSPCs. Multiple assays can be started simultaneously with the isolated HSPCs. We present protocols for downstream applications using the isolated HSPCs, primarily focused on assays for CFU capacity and assessment of DNA damage.\nIsolation of human HSPCs\nTiming: 6 h\nThis protocol is optimized for the efficient isolation of Lin- cells from as little as 2 mL of bone marrow. The Lin- population is enriched in CD34+ cells. Using this protocol, we were able to efficiently isolate Lin- cells from patients with Fanconi anemia, a bone marrow failure syndrome in which HSPCs are scarce. Using this protocol, we typically obtain 6.0×105 - 1.0×106 Lin- cells per mL of healthy bone marrow, or 1.0×105 - 2.0×105 Lin- cells per mL of Fanconi anemia bone marrow (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1042-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Strategies for enrichment of HSPC\n(A) Human Lin- cells can be enriched using a magnetic stand. Left. Cells are incubated with the progenitor cell enrichment cocktail followed by incubation with magnetic particles and incubation in the magnetic stand. Right. Lin+ cells bound by the antibodies of the enrichment cocktail and by the magnetic particles are attracted to the tube wall by the magnetic field. Lin- cells remain in suspension and can be recovered by simply pouring off the liquid into a new tube. The Lin+ cells remain in the original tube.",
    "(B) Mouse and human HSPCs can be enriched using columns for magnetic cell separation. Cells are incubated with cell enrichment cocktail followed by incubation with magnetic beads. Left. Enrichment of mouse Lin- cells is performed with the LS Miltenyi columns; enrichment of human CD34+ cells is performed with the MS Miltenyi columns. The column is mounted into the MidiMACS separator on the MACS MultiStand and prepared by adding column buffer. Center. The cell suspension is added to the top of the column. Right. The cell suspension is left to flow through the column via gravity flow. Cells bound by the magnetic particles remain bound to the column in the magnetic field, whereas unbound cells are recovered into a clean tube.\n(C) Mouse LT-HSCs can be purified from the enriched population of Lin- cells using FACS and a 5-flurochrome strategy based on the SLAM markers. Left. Detection of Lin- cells. Center. LSK cells within the Lin- population are recognized by being c-Kit+ Sca+. Right. LT-HSCs within the LSK population are recognized by being CD150+ CD48-\nNote: All steps should be performed under sterile conditions.\nPlasma removal:\nCentrifuge the whole bone marrow sample in a 15 mL conical tube at 2000 × g 4°C for 20 min. After centrifugation, remove the plasma with a pipette without disturbing the cells.\nPlasma can be aliquoted and stored long-term at −80°C if cytokine analysis of the bone marrow is needed.\nRed blood cell lysis and isolation of mononuclear cells (MNCs):\nTake 2 mL of bone marrow (after plasma removal) in a 50 mL tube and add 8 mL of ammonium chloride solution. Mix well with a pipette and then incubate for 10–15 min on ice.\nGenerally, the volume of ammonium chloride required is approximately 4× the volume of the bone marrow.",
    "Wash by directly adding 40 mL of 1× PBS and centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min.\nAspirate supernatant. Repeat the above steps until the cell pellet appears white or with very few red cells (usually 2 more times) by adding 4 mL of ammonium chloride directly to the cells and incubating for 5–10 min on ice. Wash every incubation of ammonium chloride by directly adding 40 mL of 1× PBS and centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nEnrichment of Lin- cells (we typically obtain 6.0×105–1.0×106 Lin- cells per mL of healthy bone marrow or 1.0×105–2.0×105 Lin- cells per mL of Fanconi anemia bone marrow):\nResuspend the MNC pellet in 1 mL EasySep Buffer and transfer to a 5 mL FACS tube.\nAdd 50 μL of human progenitor cell enrichment cocktail (included in the EasySep kit) for every 1 mL of cell suspension. Mix with a pipette and incubate for 15 min at 18°C–21°C.\nAdd 50 μL of magnetic particles (included in the EasySep kit) for every 1 mL of cell suspension. Mix with a pipette and incubate for 15 min at 18°C–21°C (no rotation/rocking is needed).\nAdd 2.5 mL EasySep Buffer and place the tube in the EasySep Magnet. Incubate for 15 min at 18°C–21°C (no rotation/rocking is needed).\nKeep the tube in the magnet and pour out the supernatant into a new tube (the supernatant contains the Lin- cells) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nThe cells that do not bind to the magnetic beads are Lin- cells; these cells are ready for further analyses.\nCritical: This a negative selection protocol; therefore Lin- cells will remain in the supernatant, untouched by the magnetic beads. The unwanted fraction of mature cells will bind to the magnetic beads.",
    "Alternatives: Instead of the Lin- enrichment kit, a CD34+ MicroBead kit with FcR Blocking reagent can be used.\nIsolation of mouse HSPCs\nTiming: 12 h\nThis protocol is optimized for the efficient isolation of HSPCs from wild type mice and mice with deficiency of Fanconi anemia genes. This protocol is also useful for the isolation of HSPCs after stress conditions that induce bone marrow failure in Fanconi anemia mice. We first describe a manual enrichment of Lin- cells using a column system, followed by staining of the Lin- fraction for FACS-mediated purification of LSK and LT-HSCs using the SLAM markers (Kiel et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Yilmaz et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nNote: All steps should be performed under sterile conditions.\nNote: This protocol is applied to bone marrow pooled from 3 mice.\nBone marrow harvest:\nMice euthanasia:\nMice (8–10 weeks old) are euthanized in a CO2 chamber using 2 liters per minute (Lpm) CO2 for 5 min (according to the guidelines set by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute).\nBone marrow flushing from mouse hind limbs:\nAfter euthanasia, place the mouse in a ventral position and spray with 70% ethanol for sterilization.\nUsing a scalpel, remove the muscles and tissue around the legs.\nCollect the femur and tibia by making a cut in the pelvic-hip joint.\nNote: The muscular tissue surrounding the femur and tibia can be sticky. After the initial removal of the muscles with a scalpel, paper napkins can be used to help with the manual removal of the remaining muscles.\nCut the femur and tibia at both ends.\nUsing a 27-gauge needle, fill a 10 mL syringe with HBSS++ flushing media.",
    "Insert the needle with HBSS++ flushing media into the hollow opening of the bone and flush the bone marrow into a 50 mL Falcon tube.\nContinue to flush until the bone looks transparent/white.\nEnrichment of mouse Lin- cells:\nNote: The enrichment is performed using the Lineage cell depletion kit from Miltenyi Biotec.\nMake a single cell suspension by pipetting up and down with a 10 mL pipette. Next, mix the cells using a BD 10 mL eccentric tip syringe and BD 18G 1 inch needle. Avoid foaming by releasing the cell suspension on the side of the tube.\nFilter the cell suspension through a 70 μm cell strainer into a clean 50 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min, then aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 600 μL of column buffer. Mix with a pipette.\nAdd 150 μL of the Lineage biotin antibody cocktail (from the Lineage cell depletion kit). Incubate 15 min on ice. Mix with a pipette.\nAdd 450 μL of column buffer, then add 300 μL of the anti-biotin microbeads (from the Lineage cell depletion kit). Mix with a pipette and incubate 15 min on ice.\nWash by adding 10 mL of column buffer, then centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min. Aspirate the supernatant.\nWhile the cells are in the centrifuge, set up the LS column and MidiMACS separator on the MACS MultiStand. Place a 15 mL conical tube underneath the column. Add 1 mL of column buffer to the LS column, and allow it to flow through and empty into the 15 mL conical tube by gravity flow (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL column buffer and add it to the LS column.\nWash the column twice with 1 mL of column buffer.",
    "The Lin- cells are now in the 15 mL conical tube (the Lin+ cells remain attached to the column) and can be used for further analyses. From pooling the bone marrow of three adult wild type mice, we obtain on average 3×106 Lin- cells, whereas from three adult Fanconi anemia mice we obtain 2×106 Lin- cells.\nTo elute Lin+ cells: add 1 mL column buffer to the column, then use the plunger to expel the cells attached to the beads into a new 15 mL conical tube.\nIsolation of LSK cells and LT-HSC using FACS (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C):\nNote: The Lin- cells obtained in the above protocol are ready for downstream applications. Use the following FACS staining protocol if purification of LSK cells or LT-HSC is desired.\nNote: The following protocol purifies LT-HSCs using the SLAM markers (Kiel et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Yilmaz et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). If using other markers to isolate LT-HSCs, different antibodies should be used.\nResuspend the enriched Lin- cells (from the previous step) in 1 mL of HBSS++ in a 15 mL conical tube and count them. From a single wild type mouse, we typically expect 1×106 Lin- cells.\nCritical: Single-color controls for FACS compensation are critical in this protocol.\nNote: The following single-color controls are used in this protocol:\nUnstained (autofluorescence) PE single-color control PE Cy7 single-color control APC single-color control Pacific Blue single-color control APC-Cy7 single-color control\nNote: In this protocol, we prepare single-color controls using the cells obtained from the previous Lin- enrichment.\nTake 1.5×105–2×105 Lin- cells for every single-color control and resuspend them in 100 μL of HBSS++. Keep your experimental samples in 1 mL of HBSS++.\nNote: Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] demonstrates how single-color controls are generated and how experimental samples are stained for FACS. See also text.",
    "Add 2.5 μL of each biotin-labeled lineage antibody to the PE single-color control: Biotin Hamster anti-Mouse CD3e, Biotin Rat anti-Mouse CD11b, Biotin Rat anti-Mouse CD45R, Biotin Rat anti-Mouse Ly-6G and Ly-6C, Biotin Rat anti-Mouse TER-119/Erythroid cells (all from the Biotin Mouse Lineage Panel). See Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\nAdd 25 μL of each biotin-labeled lineage antibody to each experimental sample: Biotin Hamster anti-Mouse CD3e, Biotin Rat anti-Mouse CD11b, Biotin Rat anti-Mouse CD45R, Biotin Rat anti-Mouse Ly-6G and Ly-6C, Biotin Rat anti-Mouse TER-119/Erythroid cells (all from the Biotin Mouse Lineage Panel). See Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\nAdd 2.5 μL of fluorochrome-conjugated antibody to the corresponding single-color control: PE-Cy7-Sca1 (Clone D7), APC-c-kit (Clone ACK2), Pacific Blue-CD150 (Clone TC15-12F12.2) and APC-Cy7-CD48 (Clone HM48-1). See Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\nAdd 25 μL of fluorochrome-conjugated antibody to each experimental sample: PE-Cy7-Sca1 (Clone D7), APC-c-kit (Clone ACK2), Pacific Blue-CD150 (Clone TC15-12F12.2) and APC-Cy7-CD48 (Clone HM48-1). See Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\nCritical: To ensure correct preparation of compensation controls, verify that no more than one fluorochrome is added per single-color control tube.\nNote: If LSK cells are the desired cells to be isolated, use only PE-Cy7-Sca (Clone D7) and APC-c-kit (Clone ACK2).\nIncubate on ice for 30 min. Add 10 mL of HBSS++ to both the single-color controls and the experimental samples. Centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the single-color controls in 100 μL HBSS++ and the experimental samples in 1 mL HBSS++.\nAdd 1 μL of the PE-streptavidin antibody (BD Biosciences, cat# 554061) to the PE single-color control and 7 μL to the experimental samples.\nCritical: Do not add the PE-secondary antibody to the remaining single-color controls nor to the unstained control (see chart above).",
    "Incubate on ice for 20 min. Add 10 mL of HBSS++ to the single-color controls and experimental samples. Centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant. Resuspend the experimental samples in 500 μL HBSS++, and the single-color controls in 200 μL HBSS++.\nFilter the samples using a 5 mL round bottom tube with cell strainer cap (mesh size 35 μm) to avoid large cellular clumps.\nPlace the samples on ice and proceed to FACS sorting.\nCollect the samples in 500 μL of collection media. The sorted samples are ready for downstream applications.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1042_9.csv\nNote: A representative FACS strategy is shown in Figure 1C.\nColony forming unit (CFU) assay\nTiming: 7 days for mouse CFU, 14 days for human CFU\nIn this protocol we present the optimized conditions for culturing enriched or purified HSPCs and assessing their CFU capacity in vitro. In order to determine the number of bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood cells with the capacity to form hematopoietic colonies in vitro, an aliquot of the cell suspension (unselected, enriched, or purified cells) with a known number of viable cells, must be cultured on a nutritive substrate (in this case methylcellulose, a semisolid culture medium) supplemented with specific recombinant cytokines. The semisolid methylcellulose allows for the development of hematopoietic colonies of different lineages, including erythroid, granulocytic, monocytic, granulocytic-monocytic, and mixed myeloid-erythroid colonies.\nNote: The procedure must be performed under sterile conditions under a class II laboratory cabinet at 18°C–21°C.\nNote: The same protocol can also be used for CFU quantification from umbilical cord blood samples.\nNote: Thaw the MethoCult H4434 Classic (for human samples) or MethoCult GF M3434 (for mouse samples) and bring up to 37°C in a water bath.\nCell concentration:",
    "For Lin- cells, adjust the cell concentration to 10,000 viable cells per 100 μL in StemSpan SFEM II culture medium or HBSS++.\nFor CD34+ cells or LSK cells, adjust the cell concentration to 2,000 viable cells per 100 μL in StemSpan SFEM II culture medium or HBSS++.\nNote: See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nCell culture:\nFor every 3 mL of MethoCult H4434 Classic or MethoCult GF M3434 add: 30 μL of PenStrep, 100 μL of the cell suspension adjusted to the cell concentration indicated above, depending on the purity of the cells. Finally, if applicable, add any experimental drug. Immediately vortex the cell suspension for 5–10 s.\nNote: For this step we selected the ready-to-use aliquots of 3 mL of MethoCult H4434 Classic.\nAlternatives: Both MethoCult H4434 Classic and MethoCult GF M3434 are also available in 100 mL bottles. If this is preferred to the ready-to-use version, 3 mL aliquots should be made in advance (and stored in 15 mL conical tubes). Before aliquoting, shake the bottle to homogenize, and allow any bubbles to disappear. Store the aliquots at -20°C. Thaw each aliquot at 37°C in a water bath right before use.\nCritical: Samples from patients with bone marrow failure syndromes such as Fanconi anemia, Diamond-Blackfan anemia or dyskeratosis congenita have very small amounts of HSPCs. If assessing CFU capacity in samples from these patients, consider using 3–5 times the number of input cells.\nLet the culture cell suspension stand for 5 min or until the bubbles that have formed disappear.\nIf the assay will be analyzed using the automated STEMvision machine, slowly distribute 1 mL of methylcellulose per well in a 6-well SmartDish, avoiding the formation of bubbles. Repeat this step with the remaining 2 mL of methylcellulose.",
    "Note: Each condition is plated in triplicate; a single tube containing 3 mL of methylcellulose is evenly distributed into 3 wells. Two conditions (each in triplicate) can be cultured in a 6-well plate.\nNote: The spaces between the wells of the plate must be filled with sterile water and the plate placed in a humid chamber.\nAlternatives: cells can be plated in 35 mm petri dishes (labeled on the sides) or in flat bottom non-tissue culture treated 12-well plates. Once again, plate 1 mL of the culture cell suspension in triplicate.\nCritical: Never use tissue culture treated plates, as they will promote the attachment of cells to the plate bottom. This will prevent 3D colony formation and complicate the assessment and quantification of colonies.\nCritical: To avoid evaporation of the methylcellulose, place the SmartDish in a humid chamber. The humid chamber must be prepared with sterile water in a sterile container. Sterility is warranted as the container will be placed inside the incubator for long periods of time (up to 14 days).\nIncubate the cells at 37°C for 14 days (in the case of human CFU assay), or for 7 days (in the case of mouse CFU assay). To ensure the humid chamber does not dry out, more sterile water can be added if necessary.\nNote: See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nAfter 7 or 14 days, assess the size and shape of the colonies according to the criteria presented in the expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes] section.\nNote: See troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nThe outcome of the human CFU assay plated in a SmartDish is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1042-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Scale bar represents the size of the colonies in mm.\nγH2AX foci detection in HSPCs by immunofluorescence\nTiming: 2 days\nThe formation of γH2AX foci is a well-known strategy for the detection of DNA damage and DNA repair signaling after a DNA damage insult. γH2AX foci formation is considered a surrogate for the formation of double strand breaks. Assessment of γH2AX foci formation by immunofluorescence is usually difficult to perform in suspension cells and even more difficult in rare populations such as HSPCs. Here we present an optimized protocol for performing γH2AX immunofluorescence in small amounts of sorted HSPCs. Quantification of γH2AX foci is used to assess the amount of DNA damage induced in the DNA molecule by a certain treatment, as well as for the evaluation of DNA repair kinetics when timepoints are performed. The quantification of γH2AX foci can be performed in freshly isolated HSPCs from mouse or human donors or after exposing the HSPCs in culture to agents that induce DNA damage, such as irradiation, cisplatin or mitomycin C. Use your desired cells of study: Lin- cells, CD34+ cells, LSK cells or LT-HSCs.\nSpin down the cells onto SuperFrost Plus slides:\nSet up the cytofunnel assembly.\nPipette 1.5×105 - 2×105 cells resuspended in 50 μL of PBS into each funnel, then place the assembly in the cytocentrifuge.",
    "Run at 500 × g for 5 min.\nRemove the funnel assembly from the cytocentrifuge and disassemble. Draw a circle on the back side of the microscope slide to indicate where the cells have been spun onto the slide.\nUse a hydrophobic pen to draw a border around the cells.\nAllow slides to dry completely (approximately 2 min).\nImmunofluorescence:\nFixing & permeabilization:\nPrepare 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) by diluting the stock solution in PBS. Add ∼750 μL of 4% PFA to each sample, then incubate 15 min at 18°C–21°C.\nTap off PFA from the slides, then wash 2× 5 min with PBS.\nAdd enough ice cold methanol to cover each sample (∼200 μL), then incubate for 2 min at 18°C–21°C.\nWash 2× 5 min with PBS.\nBlocking:\nPrepare fresh blocking buffer filtered through a 0.45 μm filter.\nAdd 500 μL blocking buffer to each sample.\nIncubate for 1 h at 18°C–21°C.\nPrimary antibody:\nPrepare fresh IF buffer.\nDilute anti-phospho-Histone H2A.X antibody 1:1000 in IF buffer. Add ∼100 μL to each sample.\nIncubate at 4°C in a humid chamber for 12–18 h.\nPause point: At this moment, the slides can stay overnight.\nAfter the overnight incubation at 4°C, incubate the slides at 37°C for 1 h.\nWash 3× 5 min with PBS.\nSecondary antibody:\nDilute secondary antibody (donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488) 1:500 in IF buffer. Add ∼100 μL to each sample.\nCritical: Follow the rest of the steps in the dark.\nIncubate at 37°C for 1 h in a humid chamber\nWash 2× 5 min with PBS.\nMounting:\nDry the slide such that all excess PBS is cleared off.\nAdd a drop of ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI over the cells.",
    "Place glass coverslip on top, ensuring that there are no bubbles, and that the mounting solution covers the entire coverslip.\nSeal the edges of the coverslips with clear nail polish.\nLet dry at 18°C–21°C, ∼15 min.\nImage cells right away, or store at 4°C until ready to be imaged.\nImaging: image the cells using FITC filter at 40× or 63× magnification.\nNote: See troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nAlkaline comet assay using HSPCs\nTiming: 2 days\nThe comet assay is used for assessing the breakage induced in the DNA molecule following a specific treatment. The alkaline version of the comet assay is used to detect single and double-stranded breaks in the DNA molecule. This assay can be performed in freshly isolated HSPCs from mouse or human donors, or after exposing the HSPCs in culture to agents that induce DNA breaks, such as irradiation, cisplatin or mitomycin C. The comet assay has the advantage of requiring only a small number of cells, and results can be obtained using as few as 1000 cells. Use your desired cells of study: Lin- cells, CD34+ cells, LSK cells or LT-HSCs.\nNote: Use the cells isolated from the previous protocols.\nNote: Work under dim light to avoid DNA breakage external to the treatment.\nNote: Sterility is not required.\nNote: Pre-chill the Lysis Solution to 4°C before beginning.\nMelt LMAgarose (included in the comet assay kit) in a beaker of boiling water for 5 min with the cap loosened. Then, place bottle in a 37°C water bath for at least 20 min to cool.\nCritical: Ensure the agarose does not solidify. Maintain agarose at 37°C after melting.\nCritical: Ensure the slides are lying flat during the entire procedure.",
    "Combine 1000 cells with 50 μL of LMAgarose (at 37°C) and immediately pipette this cell suspension onto a CometSlide (included in the comet assay kit).
