    "Preparation of liposomes (room temperature)Liposome in the absence of cholesterol is made by Avanti Mini-Extruder at room temperature. The dried 1.25 mg mix of PC (75%) and PE (25%) is hydrated in 1 ml buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, 150 mM NaCl). 100 nm unilamellar vesicles are obtained by extrusion as described:(http://www.avantilipids.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=185&Itemid=193[href=http://www.avantilipids.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=185&Itemid=193])Liposomes containing [3H]cholesterol are generated by using a standard sonication procedure.Dissolve dried 2.5 mg mix of PC (75%) and PE (25%) in 200 μl chloroform by vortex.Take 8 μl of above chloroform dissolved lipid mix and add 0.001 mg [3H]cholesterol (~2% molar mass). The chloroform is evaporated and dried under a stream of nitrogen. Longer drying time (4-12 h) can be used to remove any trace of organic solvent. The dry lipid film is hydrated by adding 0.5 ml of buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, 150 mM NaCl). After vortex at room temperature for 20 min, the large multilamellar vesicle suspension is disrupted with a Branson tip-sonicator until the suspension clear. For sonication, the samples are placed on ice and sonicated for 10 min with cycles including 9 seconds sonication, 9 seconds interval and 35% input.Metal particles from the sonicator tip and undisrupted lipid aggregates are removed by centrifugation at 100,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting hazy supernatant, composed primarily of small unilamellar vesicles, is stored at 4 °C. The liposomes can be stored at this condition for one week.Examine [3H]Cholesterol transfer from liposomes to proteins (Figure 1)Reactions are performed on ice.In the [3H]cholesterol/liposome to protein transfer assay, each reaction contains, in a final volume of 200 μl buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4), 4 μg of PC:PE:[3H]cholesterol liposomes, and different amounts of the acceptor protein EGFP-FLAG and EGFP::NRF-5-FLAG(15 and 30 μg) purified from 293T cells (Zhang et al., 2012).",
    "EGFP-FLAG is used as the negative control.After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, each mixture is diluted with 600 μl 50 mM Tris-Cl, 150 mM NaCl, followed by adding 70 μl 50% Flag beads. After incubation for about 1 h at 4 °C on shaker, the Flag beads are washed 4-5 times in 1,000 μl wash buffer on shaker, and bounded [3H]cholesterol is quantified by scintillation counting.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20130503/20130503023852_8210.jpgFigure 1. Schematic diagrams of the lipid transfer assay in two directionsExamine [3H]Cholesterol transfer from proteins to liposomes (Figure 1)Protein-[3H]cholesterol complex is obtained by incubating EGFP-FLAG or EGFP::NRF-5-FLAG (400 pmol) with [3H]cholesterol (100 pmol) in a final volume of 300 μl buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) for 3 h at 4 °C. The protein-[3H]cholesterol complex is pulled down by incubating with 100 μl 50% Flag beads for 2 h at 4 °C, washing 6 times as above and eluted with 100 μl Flag peptide (100 mg ml-1) for two times. In the protein-to-liposome transfer assay, each reaction contains, in a final volume of 200 μl buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4), [3H]cholesterol complexed to either EGFP or EGFP-NRF-5 (40 μl), and different amounts of acceptor PC liposomes (50 and 100 ng). After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, each mixture is diluted with 600 μl of buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4).Liposomes are separated by centrifuging at 10,000 x g (hard to detect weight at this stage) for 30 min at 4 °C. The lipososomes can be seen as a small white patch at the bottom of the tube.Wash the liposomes 4-5 times in the buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl), with 500 μl buffer used in each tube at each time.",
    "The liposomes are collected by centrifuge (10,000 x g) after each wash. The amount of [3H]cholesterol transferred to liposomes is determined by scintillation counting."
