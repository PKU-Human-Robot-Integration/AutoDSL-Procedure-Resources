    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nBefore we begin, we wish to point out that steps 1–14 described under sections ‘Creating a Nested Case-Control Study,’ ‘selection of sociobehavioral or other exposure variables[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2]’, ‘selection and creation of biomarker exposure variables[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3]’, and ‘handling of MSD data below the limits of quantitation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4]’ were required to be performed for our analysis of the Sabes study before we could conduct the LASSO analysis, which is the main focus of this protocol. Thus, not all of these steps are required to be performed in a given scenario. Those applying these procedures may need to perform or skip one or more of these steps as required based on data availability, type, and structure. For example, if the case-control study participants are already identified, and the analysis variables (relevant predictors and response variables) are already selected and acquired, one can start directly from step 15 in the Section ‘gathering the data[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.5]’.\nCreating a nested (and individual matched) case-control study\nTiming: 1–7 days\nThis protocol has been developed for a nested case-control study. A case-control study compares a group of individuals with a disease or a known condition (termed ‘cases’) with a group of individuals without the disease or the condition (termed ‘controls’) to identify risk factors that may contribute towards its occurrence. In a nested case-control (NCC) study, cases and controls are drawn from the same pre-defined cohort.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] Thus, cases occurring in that cohort are identified and, for each case, a specified number of matched controls are selected from the same cohort from among those who never developed the condition. In the context of this protocol, participants who were diagnosed with incident HIV will be considered cases, while those who did not acquire HIV during the study will be considered as controls.",
    "Note: Perform prior to acquiring samples for laboratory work, if required. This could facilitate completing laboratory work only for the nested case-control set, if not intended to be performed on the entire cohort. Steps to select and code/recode matching variables, using software packages to select the matched controls should take between a few hours to a few days.\nTo create a nested case-control study, the first step is to select the parent cohort, from which the ‘cases’ and ‘controls’ are to be drawn.\nIdentify all (or a fraction) of participants with the outcome (HIV) from the cohort as cases for the study.\nNote: In designing a case-control study, cases and controls are often matched with respect to predefined factors, called ‘matching variables’.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] The goal of matching is to achieve better balance across different levels of the matching variables, which can reduce the variance of the parameters of interest, leading to improved statistical efficiency.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nNote: Matching can be either (i) individually matched: for each case, select one or more controls that match the case on the matching variables, (ii) frequency matched: not done at an individual participant level, but instead seeking to achieve an overall balance in distribution of the matched characteristics between the case and control groups. This protocol considers a case-control study with individual matching.\nTo create an individually matched case-control study, identify the matching variables.",
    "Note: Cases are matched to controls based on variables that are believed to be confounders. A confounder is a variable that influences both the exposure and the outcome. In other words, a confounder needs to satisfy the following conditions: (i) It must be statistically associated (or correlated) with the exposure, (ii) It must cause the outcome, and not the reverse(iii) It must not be a mediator, that is, it should not lie on the causal pathway between the exposure and the outcome.\nCritical: If controls are matched to cases based on variable(s) that are not true confounder(s), the statistical efficiency of the studied associations can be impacted. For example, if the matching variable is not associated with disease but is associated with the exposure, or if the matching variable is only associated with disease, then that often leads to a loss of efficiency. On the other hand, if the matching variable(s) lie on the causal pathway between the exposure and outcome, then matching can introduce bias in the analysis.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] Thus, matching variables must be carefully chosen a priori, only if there is belief that they are confounders for the exposure – outcome model. The number of matching variables should be kept low, as increasing the number of matching variables causes cases and controls to become too similar to each other with respect to the exposure.\nBased on the selected variables, identify   n   matched controls per case.\nNote: In R, matching can be employed using the ccwc function from the Epi package, which is specially curated for the nested case control study; or using the MatchIt package.",
    "Note: With equal difficulty in obtaining cases and controls, choosing   n = 1   is the optimal choice for statistical efficiency. However, the number of cases available is often limited by the rarity of the outcome (e.g., incident HIV acquisition). In this instance, statistical power can be increased by selecting more than one control per case; there is rapidly diminishing return after increasing the number of controls beyond 3:1 per case.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\nIf needed, create more than one matched set of controls, each based on a different set of matching variables.",
    "Note: To illustrate through an example, we provide below an overview of the case-control selection mechanism from Sabes, which led to the development of this protocol. Between 2013 and 2017, the Sabes study evaluated an HIV treatment-as-prevention intervention among persons assigned male at birth who have sex with men (MSM and transgender women, TW), the populations most affected by HIV in Lima, Peru. In brief, of 2,685 MSM and TW who did not have HIV but were considered at high risk for exposure, 2,109 entered a longitudinal cohort and were tested monthly by point-of-care third-generation HIV immunoassay and for HIV-1 RNA by pooled NAAT test if negative.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7],11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] The case-control sample was created by identifying from Sabes, 90 case participants who were diagnosed with incident HIV, either while HIV-seronegative with detection of HIV-1 RNA by nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) or having had a negative HIV Ag/Ab test within 3 months prior,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] and by identifying 3 matched controls per case who did not acquire HIV during the study (N = 270). Two controls were matched by time under observation, meaning they were followed for at least the same number of months as the case and had available samples at matched study visits. The third control was matched by calendar month to account for seasonal variation in exposures or other secular trends that might influence exposures or immune activation.\nSelection of sociobehavioral or other exposure variables\nTiming: Up to 1 month",
    "Selection of sociobehavioral or other exposure variables to include in models is completed a priori and may be based on prior statistical models. In the case of this protocol, we selected variables based on prior work within the Sabes study, detailed in a published doctoral thesis by A. Ulrich.12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] Any demographic, clinical, or behavioral variables can be selected for use. These variables can include continuous, categorical, ordinal, or binary variables, as appropriate. Below we describe how data assessed and defined as variables for inclusion in this analysis. Data used in our study were collected at enrollment into the Sabes study and at monthly follow-up visits via computer assisted self-interview (CASI) questionnaires in Spanish, as detailed in the published Sabes design strategy.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]\nNote: Complete prior to planned analysis. Time varies depending on the source and type of the data, need for creating secondary variables, data cleaning, etc.\nSelect Demographic/clinical data:\nNote: We used the following data collected at enrollment/baseline (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3039_1.csv\n∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001.\naAdjusted for all other terms presented in multivariate model.\nAge: summarized as both a continuous (median, IQR) and Boolean variable (<25 or ≥25 years) to limit the number of categories.\nGender: binary, self-reported as either cisgender man or transgender women.\nEducation: binary, categorized as either any postsecondary education vs. no post-secondary education.\nIncome: binary, categorized as either above or below Peruvian minimum wage at the time of study commencement (750 Peruvian Neuvo Soles/month, or approximately $220 USD).\nSelf-reported predominant sexual role: categorized as—insertive, receptive, or versatile (participates as both the insertive and receptive partner).\nSelf-identified sexual orientation: categorized as heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual, using appropriate Spanish language terminology.\nSelf-identified sex worker status: binary, categorized as sex worker or not.\nSexual behavior.",
    "Total number of male and transgender women partners in the previous three months.\nFrequency of condom use with male partners (reported as CLAI or condomless anal intercourse).\nParticipants were also asked a series of specific questions about their last three male sexual partners in the previous three months including sexual role with each partner, partner’s HIV status, condom use with the partner (CLAI), and dates of first and most recent sex with the partner.\nSubstance use information included indicators of alcohol and drug use associated sex in the previous three months. The baseline survey did not include drug use in the absence of sex, nor specific types of drug use with sex (i.e., marijuana, amyl nitrites, or cocaine).\nAlcohol Use Disorder (AUD) was categorized in three categories: none, hazardous/harmful, and dependent, as identified by the Alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT), a series of questions related to alcohol consumption and consequences of alcohol use in the previous year.13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]\nA score of 8 or greater on the AUDIT was considered an AUD; a score of 8–20 was indicative of harmful drinking, and a score of >20 was indicative of dependent drinking.\nNote: The original analysis included a score of 20 in the middle category, but this current analysis included a middle category of 8–19 with ≥20 as the highest AUD category. Tables 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] demonstrate variables as analyzed originally.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3039_2.csv",
    "Most time varying factors were not used in the LASSO model, other than a combined count of episodes of sex with a non–main partner due to a smaller dataset and fewer timepoints selected than the data below from entire parent Sabes study. These analyses are presented as background to demonstrate the effect modification of alcohol consumption on other covariates. As the previously published manuscript to which this protocol refers focused on the immune markers, this degree of detail on variable selection for sociobehavioral covariates was not included in that publication and so is presented here.\nThe original analysis included AUDIT >20 as the highest category, the final analysis presented in the LASSO includes ≥20 (20 inclusive) as the highest category.\naCompared with no AUD. AUDIT 0–7 = No AUD, AUDIT 8–20 = Harmful/hazardous drinking patterns, AUDIT>20 = Dependent drinking patterns.\nbAdjusted for age category, income, education, role, and sex worker status.\nIncluded in the AUDIT questionnaire was a measure of binge drinking, defined by greater than 5 alcoholic drinks per occasion at any time in the past year.\nConsider using time-varying data, including behavioral data:\nNote: We used the following data collected during cohort follow-up (not all used in this statistical protocol but presented as examples in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]).\nAlcohol consumption: at each monthly visit, participants were asked by CASI about:\nAny alcohol consumption: binary (yes/no).\nLevel of alcohol consumption (number of standard alcoholic drinks per day).\nBinge drinking habits (any days with >5 standard alcoholic drinks).\nWhether alcohol was consumed before or during sex in the previous 30 days.",
    "Ongoing sexual exposures: From the sum of time-varying sexual exposures detailed in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2], given that episodes of sex with a main partner were not associated with HIV, we combined all other encounters into a single category called “Episodes of CLAI with a non-main partner in the last 30 days”.\nDue to the limited sample size of this case-control analysis as well as use of difference in exposure time frame between baseline (within 3 months) and each monthly visit (within 30 days), a limited number of variables was considered for exploratory analyses in this protocol. Additional time-updated variables could be used more extensively if desired in other applications of this method.\nAs the biomarker variables selected included change in biomarker over time, we were careful to not focus on variables measured only at or after the last biomarker sample was collected for this use case.\nConduct univariate and multivariate analyses using standard statistical methods to inform variables to be included in the nested LASSO regression.\nNote: Standard Multivariable regression techniques identified baseline predictors of HIV acquisition and informed variables used in the nested LASSO regression. Overall HIV incidence in the cohort was 11.7 per 100 person-years of follow-up. Forty-five people were diagnosed with acute (N = 5) or recent (N = 40) infection during cohort enrollment and these cases were included in cohort incidence calculations. During cohort follow-up, 262 incident HIV cases were detected, resulting in a total of 307 incident HIV cases in the study population. The below analysis describes how variables were analyzed to determine variable inputs for the LASSO regression. The results of these analyses are described in Tables 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].",
    "Bivariate Cox proportional hazards regression with robust standard errors to account for clustering by participant was first conducted on each sociodemographic variable of interest. Hazard ratios (HR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each variable, Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\nVariables associated with HIV acquisition with p ≤ 0.05 were considered in a multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model with robust standard errors. Models were assessed using stepwise backward elimination and variables were maintained in the model if the p-value was ≤0.05.\nIn bivariate analysis of demographic characteristics, self-identified sex workers were significantly less likely to acquire HIV than non-sex workers (HR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.39–0.79).\nIn multivariable analysis, younger age was associated with increased HIV risk: those 18–22 years were 2.47 times more likely (95% CI: 1.84–3.30) and those 23–28 years were 1.73 times more likely (95% CI: 1.28–2.35) to acquire HIV compared to those 29 years or older.\nThose with any post-secondary education were more likely to acquire HIV than those without (adjusted Hazard Ratio or aHR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.05–1.75).\nSelf-identified receptive and versatile sex roles were more likely to acquire HIV compared to those identifying as insertive partners only (aHR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.03–2.09; aHR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.30–2.46, respectively).\nAlthough AUD was not predictive of HIV acquisition in bivariate or multivariable models, the proportion with harmful and hazardous varied significantly by age, education status, income, transgender identity, and sex work, and so AUD was also included in further models. AUDIT category also modified the association between other behaviors and HIV acquisition and was hypothesized to modify both HIV host susceptibility and exposure potential.",
    "Poisson regression models with a log link (Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE)) were employed to calculate the relative risk of HIV acquisition associated with each risk behavior, stratified by the three AUD levels (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]).\nSelection and creation of biomarker exposure variables\nTiming: 1 week–1 month\nNote: Selection of the relevant biomarker panel may require an in-depth literature review and may take anywhere between few hours to weeks. Lab work could be initiated as soon as institutional approvals are acquired and samples are in hand. Lab work should take roughly 2 days to complete per set of plates, if using the methods employed here (MSD). If using previously completed laboratory data, skip to “Handling of MSD data” section or substitute relevant biomarkers of choice and appropriate data cleaning steps as required.\nSelect biomarkers based on possible associations with HIV acquisition and add to a custom Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) U-PLEX chemiluminescent immunoassay panel (Meso Scale Diagnostics, Rockville, MD).3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]\nPerform the MSD laboratory work per manufacturer specifications in technical replicates.\nNote: This analysis protocol is suitable for use with any set of multiple biomarkers, measured via any methodology. If using an omics (proteomics, transcriptomics etc.) approach, strongly consider identifying significant variables via analytic methods appropriate to the technology, and then entering only those identified outputs as variables into this step of the process.\nHandling of MSD data below the limits of quantitation\nTiming: 2–8 h\nNote: This data handling step should be conducted prior to use of MSD data.\nRefer to Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] below for the Limits of Quantitation (LLQ) and the imputed values for below LLQ values in the dataset used in this analysis.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3039_3.csv",
    "Employ a similar strategy for other assay types or analytes. MSD data handling provided here to reproduce our methods. Other methods of handling LLQ data can be considered.\nMSD outputs produce a value for the calculated mean concentration (Calc. Conc. Mean) when both technical replicates are quantifiable.\nFor values that are NaN (Not a Number), either one or both technical replicates are outside the quantifiable range.\nReview the electrical signal output from the assay to determine whether the value is above or below the quantifiable range. As we have never encountered levels above the upper limit of quantification (ULQ), only BLLQ samples are handled here.\nIf one technical replicate has a concentration value while its counterpart does not, see if the Adjusted Signals are within 10% of one another ( |Value1-Value2|/Value1 ). If they are, take the value for Calc. Conc. Mean.\nNote: For samples for which both technical replicates are NaN (BLLQ), one can either choose to impute the mean LLQ/2 (given that different assays and runs contain their own standards and may produce different stated LLQs) or to use ½ the lowest calculated value recorded by the machine, given that MSD software will often calculate concentrations below the stated LLQ successfully. We suggest imputing this value to avoid having imputed BLLQ values higher or similar to observed values.\nGathering the data\nTiming: 1–2 h",
    "For our analysis, this step is conducted once the above steps (‘Creating a Nested Case-Control Study,’ ‘selection of sociobehavioral or other exposure variables[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2]’, ‘selection and creation of biomarker exposure variables[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3]’, and ‘handling of MSD data below the limits of quantitation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4]’) are completed. However, as discussed previously, some of the steps above (step 1–14) may not be required for a given use case. For example, if the case-control study variables (response and relevant predictors) have already been acquired and ready for analysis, one can start directly from step 15 below.\nNote: This step should be relatively fast. May require some data-processing steps.\nGather all the relevant covariates and outcomes in relevant file formats (we recommend using .txt, .csv or .xlsx formats) and read into R using base functions like read.table and read.csv or read.xlsx functions from the xlsx package.\nBase model A (see also Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4] for outcomes) Assemble baseline sociobehavior demographics for the first base model. Any set of covariates could be selected depending on exposures of interest.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3039_4.csv\nAUDIT 0–7 = No Alcohol use disorder (AUD), AUDIT 8–20 = Harmful/hazardous drinking patterns, AUDIT>20 = Dependent drinking patterns. CLAI: Condomless Anal Intercourse. All participants were male at birth and reported sex with men, hence gender identity categories as reported.\nBase model B Assemble Biomarker data for the second base model, for example, cytokine data generated from the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) U-PLEX chemiluminescent immunoassay panel can be used as described above (see also Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5] below for outcomes).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3039_5.csv\naMissing data precluded inclusion of ΔTNF–b in the LASSO models.",
    "Note: To illustrate through an example, we provide here an overview of the steps that were performed to gather all the relevant data for implementation of this protocol for the Sabes study. Baseline factors assembled for base model A for our analysis with Sabes included age, education, gender identity, participation in sex work, AUDIT score, report of condomless anal intercourse (CLAI), and sexual role (insertive or receptive partner exclusively, or versatile). Not all variables included in prior work with the full cohort (Tables 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]) were included in the base model, as they might not have been found statistically significant in our prior work (i.e.: sexual orientation), or that the exposure might have been rare (i.e.: opiate, methamphetamine, amyl nitrate use among the nested case-control group). Data from the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) U-PLEX chemiluminescent immunoassay panel (IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-12p70, IP-10, IFN-γ, TNF-α, TNF-β, andMIP-1α) was cleaned and used for the second LASSO model. Given the range of values of the biomarkers from the MSD panel, values were log-transformed before the analysis, as done in our prior work.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7],14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12],15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13] Defining the date of HIV diagnosis as X, we used sociobehavioral data and MSD data from the visit one month prior to HIV diagnosis or matched visit (X-1) as well as the baseline enrollment visit (ENR). Thus, for our analysis with the Sabes study, we had two measurement windows for these variables, ENR and X-1. The research questions of interest in applications of this statistical method should determine how many measurements are required from these variables and the appropriate proximity of the exposure measurements to the outcome of interest. For the Sabes study, one of the strengths of this cohort was the short interval between available X-1 samples and X (often <30 days).",
    "In the work conducted for the published biomarker analysis, we explored the associations between biomarkers at ENR and X-1 separately with HIV acquisition and then the change between ENR to X-1 and HIV acquisition. Because the delta between these two timepoints was more predictive than the absolute values proximal to HIV acquisition (X-1) or study entry, we use the log-transformed cytokine deltas ([X-1] – ENR) in Model B.",
    "Choosing an appropriate analysis for the study design\nTiming: 1–3 days\nBecause matching does not completely control for the effects of the matching variables it is important to perform matched or stratified analyses to control for residual confounding. Conditional logistic regression is therefore preferred over the standard logistic regression model for matched case-control studies for this reason.16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14] The conditional logistic regression model differs from the standard logistic regression model in that it can account for stratification by allowing a different intercept for each stratum in the data. Thus, each matched unit of cases and controls that forms a stratum in an individually matched case-control study can have a different intercept in the conditional logistic regression model. The matching variable(s) are then typically not included in the model.\nNote: Perform prior to conducting analysis. For those with biostatistical expertise, this may be relatively straightforward and fast.\nUse a conditional logistic regression model to evaluate associations between HIV acquisition (the outcome) and demographic risk factors as well as biomarkers (step 15).\nNote: Conditional logistic regression can be run using the clogit function in survival package in R (sample codes included in “Quantification and statistical analysis” section below).\nCorrecting for overfitting and running the base models\nTiming: 1–7 days\nThis protocol considers the scenario in which the number of (possibly co-linear) demographic risk factors and biomarkers of interest is relatively high. Regression procedures suffer from overfitting when a large number of covariates are included; the model may fit the training data well, but it may not generalize well to real-world instances. Performing ‘variable selection’, identifies a smaller set of features or explanatory variables that can fit the training data sufficiently well, while producing more accurate predictions.\nNote: Perform once model variables are selected.",
    "Perform variable selection using a penalized regression approach (LASSO) for base models A and B (step 15 under ‘gathering the data[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.5]’).\nNote: Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator or LASSO is a popular variable selection tool in generalized regression problems,2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] and results in better prediction accuracy and interpretability of the resulting statistical model. LASSO estimates the regression coefficients by maximizing the log-likelihood function with the additional constraint that the sum of the absolute values of the regression coefficients is bounded above by a positive constant. A result of adding these constraints is that estimates of regression coefficients from LASSO are sparse, that is, some or many regression coefficients are estimated exactly as 0, and those corresponding variables can be dropped from the model.\nNote: Although originally proposed for linear regression models, it has been shown recently that LASSO can be adapted to other regression paradigms as well, including the conditional logistic regression model. Standard libraries exist in most software packages to implement LASSO for different classes of regression. The clogitL1 package i is available to conduct conditional logistic regression with LASSO17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15] in R. .\nCritical: Because LASSO puts constraints on the size of coefficients associated with each variable, and the coefficient value for each variable depends on the magnitude of that variable, it is recommended to standardize variables. The standard LASSO algorithm implemented through the glmnet function has a standardization step by default, controlled via the argument ‘standardize’, with the default value for this option being ‘TRUE’. However, the clogitL1 function does not have this step in-built as a default. Hence, before running LASSO with the clogitL1 function, it is recommended to standardize variables first.",
    "Select the desired lambda   λ   penalization hyperparameter to be applied to the regression coefficients. This determines the stringency with which more variables are added to the model.\nSelect   λ   manually or by ‘tuning’ or optimizing through data-driven methods, for example by cross-validation. Cross-validation is a resampling approach that uses different portions of the data to train and test a model on different iterations. It can be used to find the optimal value of a model hyperparameter that leads to the lowest prediction error.18[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]\nLASSO should be used strictly for variable selection, and not for final estimation of the model parameters For each base model, once LASSO is run and the variables are selected, run a conditional logistic regression (without LASSO) with only the chosen variables to estimate the final model parameters including coefficient, odds ratio (OR) and the adjusted p value. The final models (as mentioned earlier) are denoted as Model A, chosen for step 15 (a), and Model B, chosen for step 15 (b).\nNote: Please see section ‘Quantification and statistical analysis’ section later where we present useful details to conduct steps 17 and 18 in R for a hypothetical example.\nMerging datasets, nesting models, calculating percent change in odds ratios\nTiming: 1–7 days\nNote: Perform following completion of base LASSO models.\nTo see if the relationship between socio-behavioral variables and HIV acquisition is affected or mediated by the biomarkers, merge the two datasets consisting of sociobehavioral variables and immune biomarkers (from step 15) together and repeat steps 17–18.\nNote: The details are given below.",
    "Note: With this analysis, we can determine if the specific biomarkers (dynamic changes in immune states or cytokines in our study) are associated with HIV acquisition after adjusting for socio-behavioral markers, and/or if the set of biomarkers add complementary information to the association between sociobehavioral markers and HIV acquisition.\nInclude all variables from the base models A and B in the joint model (regardless of whether they were selected in the final LASSO models), such that each base model is nested within the joint model, which we denote as Model C.\nOnce appropriate variables for the combined sociobehavioral and immune biomarkers are selected by LASSO from the joint model, run a multivariable conditional logistic regression with the selected variables for Model C, as in Step 18.\nDetermine effect modification by assessing a certain threshold of change in the effect size of the covariates between Model A and Model C, with biomarkers included in the joint model.\nFor example, if   Y   represents a disease or condition,   X   represents a treatment, and   M  , an instrumental variable or a biomarker measured, then PTE is calculated as the percentage change in the coefficient for effect of   X   on   Y   between two models, (i) a model with only   X   and   Y  , that is, without adjusting for   M  , and (ii) another model with   X   and   Y  , but which adjusts for   M  . PTE was first proposed in the setting of logistic regression models but has been extended for other regression models since then.19[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17] Here it is applied to the 2 nested datasets as opposed to a single   X   and   M  .",
    "Note: This idea is borrowed from Freedman et al. in 1992,19[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17] in which ‘proportion of treatment effect explained’ or PTE, was defined in the context of a clinical study as the proportion of the treatment effect on the outcome that is mediated or explained by the third or more variable(s).\nFor this protocol, biomarkers are considered as possible mediators between the sociobehavioral covariates for exposure and HIV acquisition (see Graphical Abstract, with direct and indirect pathways to HIV acquisition including increased immune susceptibility or not).\nReport the percent change in OR of each sociobehavioral factor selected in Model C vs. the base LASSO model including only sociobehavioral covariates (Model A).\nAlternate interpretation step: If it is of interest to study the effect of the sociobehavioral factors on the biomarkers, calculate the percent difference in biomarker effect on HIV acquisition comparing the coefficients/OR from Model C vs. Model B."
