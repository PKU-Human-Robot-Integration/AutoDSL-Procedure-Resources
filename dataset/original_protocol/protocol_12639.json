    "1. Preparation of fresh spore suspension\nInoculate 20 μL of a stock spore suspension (1 x 107 spores/mL) in the center of a culture plate containing Czapek-Dox (CD) medium with 20 mM uridine (autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min, Table 1).\nIncubate at 30 °C for 7 days to promote spore formation.\nAdd 1.5 mL of 0.01 % Tween 20 solution (autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min) to the culture plate containing spores and suspend the spores by scraping with a cell spreader.\nCollect the spore suspension in a sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube using a pipette.\nStore the suspension at 4 °C until use.\n\tNOTE: Use the spore suspension in the following procedure within 2 weeks. To make a stock for long-term storage, add glycerol to the spore suspension to a final concentration of 15% and store at -80 °C.\n2. Preculture\nAdd 100 mL of polypeptone-dextrin (PD) medium (Table 2) in a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask, and autoclave it at 121 °C for 20 min.\nAfter confirming that the temperature of the medium is reduced, add the uridine solution, sterilized by passing through a filter with a pore size of 0.22 μm, to a final concentration of 20 mM.\nAdd 200 μL of the spore suspension (1 x 107 spores/mL) prepared in step 1.4, and incubate at 30 °C with shaking at 120 rpm for 36 h.\n3. Preparation of protoplasts\nHarvest the fungal biomass prepared in step 2.3 on a glass filter with pore size of 30 μm (autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min).\nPour 100 mL of distilled water (DW) (autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min) on the glass filter and stir several times with a spatula (autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min).",
    "After washing with DW, pour 100 mL of sodium chloride (NaCl) buffer (autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min, Table 3) on the glass filter and stir several times with a spatula.\nTransfer about 1−2 mL (wet volume) of the cells to a 50 mL conical tube using a spatula (autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min).\nAfter adding 15 mL of the enzyme solution (sterilized by passing through a 0.22 μm pore sized filter, Table 4) to a 50 mL conical tube, add NaCl buffer until the total volume reaches 30 mL.\nClose the lid and seal with paraffin film. Incubate at 30 °C with shaking at 60 rpm for 2 h.\nFlow the resulting solution through a 70 μm cell strainer attached to the 50 mL conical tube to remove the unreacted mycelia.\nCentrifuge the protoplast solution in a 50 mL conical tube at 2,150 x g and 4 °C for 20 min.\nGently discard the supernatant to prevent pellet from dislodging. Add 1 mL of ice-cold sterilized solution B (autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min, Table 5) and gently suspend the precipitated protoplasts by pipetting.\nTransfer the suspended protoplasts to a sterile 1.5 mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 2,220 x g and 4 °C for 5 min and remove the supernatant. Then, add 1 mL of ice-cold solution B and gently suspend the pellet by pipetting.\nRepeat step 3.9.\nUsing a hemocytometer, measure the number of protoplasts under a microscope.\nPrepare a protoplast suspension (1−3 x 107 protoplasts/mL) in solution B and store it on ice until use.\n\tNOTE: Use the protoplast suspension immediately in the following procedure.\n4. Introduction of DNA for secretory production of protein",
    "Using a plasmid containing a DNA cassette for secretory production of protein as a template, amplify the DNA fragment required for secretory production by PCR.\nPrepare the DNA sample to be used for transformation by processing the PCR product using a PCR purification kit.\nAdd 1 mL of the protoplast solution, 200 μL of solution C (autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min, Table 6), and 50 μL of the DNA sample (0.5−1 μg/μL) in a sterile, precooled 15 mL conical tube, and mix the solution gently by pipetting.\n\tNOTE: Solution C is highly viscous and can be difficult to handle; ensure thorough mixing by pipetting.\nIncubate the tube on ice for 30 min.\nAdd 1.5 mL of solution C, mix gently by pipetting, and then, leave the solution at room temperature for 20−30 min.\n5. Direct liquid culture screening\nNOTE: Select the culture system using Erlenmeyer flasks (section 5.1) or microplates (section 5.2).\nCulture system using a 200 mL Erlenmeyer flask\n\t\nAdd 50 mL of PD medium containing 0.8 M sorbitol to a 200 mL Erlenmeyer flask, and sterilize by autoclaving at 121 °C for 20 min.\nAfter confirming that the temperature of the medium is reduced, add the protoplast suspension prepared in step 4.5 to a final concentration of 1 x 105 protoplasts/mL.\nIncubate the culture for 6 days at 30 °C with shaking at 120 rpm.\nCollect 1 mL of the medium and store in a 1.5 mL tube at 4 °C. Store the culture sample at -20 ° C, if not analyzed immediately.\nMix 20 μL of culture sample and 20 μL of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer (Table 7) in a 1.5 mL tube and boil at 95 ° C for 5 min.",
    "After cooling on ice, load 20 μL of the boiled sample and 5 μL of prestained protein standard on a precast gel and analyze the secretory production of the target heterologous protein by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)10.\nCulture system using a 24 well microplate\n\t\nAdd the protoplast suspension prepared in step 4.5 to sterilized 0.8 M sorbitol-containing PD medium to a final concentration of 1 x 105 protoplasts/mL, and gently mix by pipetting.\nAdd 1 mL of the solution prepared in step 5.2.1 to three wells in a 24 well microplate.\nAffix the lid and incubate at 30 °C with shaking at 175 rpm for 10 days.\nCollect 1 mL of medium and store in a 1.5 mL tube at 4 ° C. Store the culture sample at -20 ° C, if not analyzed immediately.\nMix 20 μL of the culture sample and 20 μL of SDS sample buffer in a 1.5 mL tube and boil at 95 ° C for 5 min.\nAfter cooling on ice, load 20 μL of the boiled sample and 5 μL of prestained protein standard on a precast gel and analyze the secretory production of the target heterologous protein by SDS-PAGE10.\nSubscription Required.
