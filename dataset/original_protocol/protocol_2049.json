Optimal fixation and devitellinization ensures proper visualization of architectural components. Problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nDechorionation:\nCollect 50–100 embryos in water in a small beaker with the help of a brush.\nAdd bleach (Sodium hypochlorite) to the water to a final concentration of 50% (v/v) and treat the embryos for 2–3 min to remove the chorion. The complete removal of the chorion can be assessed by observing under the microscope.\nCollect the embryos in a home-made sieve made by cutting 50 mL Falcon tube (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1641-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Dechorionation, fixation, and devitellinization of embryos setup\n(A) Dechorionated embryos collected and washed thoroughly in a home-made falcon sieve.\n(B) Fixed embryos form a ring at the Heptane-PBS interphase. Devitellinized embryos settle down promptly after addition of ice-cold methanol.\nWash the embryos thoroughly with running tap water straining through the sieve mesh, till smell of bleach is no longer detectable.\nCritical: Sodium hypochlorite is toxic and can de-stain clothes. While handling wear gloves and lab coat.\nNote: Bleach should be freshly diluted before use and not stored.\nIt is very important to remove residual bleach by rinsing thoroughly with tap water since bleach is a strong oxidizing agent and may interfere with the steps that follow. Problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nFixation and devitellinization:\nRinse embryos twice with 1× PBS. 1× PBS can be prepared and stored at 4°C for one month.",
    "Collect embryos in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and keep on ice for 10 min to chill. Size of tube and volume of fixative should be decided according to the number of embryos processed. For about 50–100 embryos, a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube can be used. For higher numbers (>500 to 0.5 gm), a 15 mL screw cap polypropylene tube can be used.\nFill the tube up to 80% with fixation buffer:heptane mix (1:1, v/v), to avoid loss of embryos due to sticking on the walls. The protocol detailed here is for ∼100 embryos that can be processed in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nTo fix, submerge embryos in 0.6 mL of fixation buffer (1× PBS containing 4% formaldehyde, prepare fresh just before use and do not store) and add equal volume of heptane (0.6 mL).\nMix by vigorous shaking and then incubate the tube on a rotating wheel at 100 rpm at 25°C for 20 min. The NuMat isolation can also be done without fixation and for this formaldehyde should not be added to the devitellinization mix.\nLet the tube stand on ice for 2 min to allow separation of the aqueous and organic phases.\nGently aspirate and discard the lower aqueous phase without sucking any embryos in the process. The good quality fixed embryos form a ring at the junction of aqueous phase and heptane (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nTo devitellinized the embryos, add methanol (pre-chilled at −20°C, volume equal to heptane). Shake vigorously and let devitellinized embryos settle at the bottom. Gently aspirate and discard supernatant.\nWash these embryos twice, in quick succession, by adding 1 mL pre-chilled methanol, allowing the embryos to settle down and then discarding the supernatant by gentle aspiration.",
    "In all the steps of washing embryos, give time for embryos to settle down completely and then pipette out the solution from the tubes to prevent the loss of sample in the procedure. Fine tip should be used to aspirate solutions since it prevents loss of embryos.\nOnly the good quality embryos that settle down to the bottom should be used for NuMat preparation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: It is very important to add pre-chilled methanol and to shake the tube vigorously after adding methanol for proper devitillinization of the embryos. After devitillinization, the embryos should appear whitish in color as compared to non-devitellinized embryos which appear yellowish in color. Devitellinized embryo sink to the bottom of the tube, and embryos with vitelline membrane still attached, float at the surface or interface. Problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nCritical: Formaldehyde is toxic. Always use in a fume hood.\nPause point: These dechorionated, devitellinized and fixed embryos can be safely stored at −20°C in methanol and used for one month. This step is useful for pooling embryos of lines with low rate of oviposition.\nDissection and fixation of larval tissue\nTiming: 1 h\nIn Drosophila, the effects of a genetic manipulation may not manifest in the nuclei of early embryos because of masking due to maternal deposition of the molecule of interest. In such cases, the phenotype would be visible only at later stages of embryonic development. This necessitates to use the protocol in older embryos or specific tissues in the larval stages (salivary glands or imaginal disks). The next few steps detail the dissection and fixation of larval tissue for the purpose. The following steps (3–7) are not in continuation of steps 1 and 2, but run independently and converge with steps 1 and 2 at step 8.",
    "Transfer the 3rd instar larvae of desired phenotype with the help of a brush in a glass cavity block with 1× PBS. Wash the larvae of any adhering food material.\nDissect out the tissue of interest (salivary glands or imaginal discs) with the help of dissecting needles and forceps. Dissecting 20 larvae to yield 20 pairs of salivary glands/20 pairs of different imaginal discs is good enough for the purpose.\nIt is good to keep the glands/discs in bunches without separating them in individual entities, as this prevents their loss. They can be separated after the completion of the whole process, just before mounting on a slide for observation.\nAlso place the dissected tissues in chambered slides. Usually, it is difficult to view dissected tissues in an Eppendorf tube and this results in loss of material during pipetting steps.\nFixation, washings and all the processes for in situ NuMat preparation can be carried out in chambered slide, under the view of an inverted microscope. In such a situation, instead of using a rotating wheel, a platform shaker should be used for shaking during incubation.\nAddition or removal of solution should be done while keeping the tip of pipette tip in view and avoid sucking out of the tissue. This prevents the loss of any material during processing.\nRemove the 1× PBS and replace it with fixation buffer and incubate it at 25°C for 20 min.\nRemove the fixation buffer and proceed to steps for in situ NuMat preparation as detailed below.\nIn situ NuMat preparation\nTiming: 3–4 h\nAllow embryos to settle down and discard methanol by gentle aspiration.\nWash the embryos by filling up the tube with 1 mL PBT (can be prepared and stored at 4°C for a month) and allowing the embryos to settle to the bottom.",
    "Repeat for three times in quick succession. When using larval tissue, fixed tissue is also washed with PBT three times in chambered slides.\nRehydrate the embryos three times for 20 min each with 1 mL pre-chilled PBT with rotation at 40 rpm at 25°C. Such rehydration is not needed for tissues as they are already in aqueous medium.\nNote: Aliquot few embryos/tissues in a 1.5 mL of microfuge tube in 0.5 mL PBT and store at 4°C. Store two such aliquots if both immuno-fluorescence and TEM analysis are required. These aliquots serve as the controls which are not treated with salt extractions and DNase I digestion. These untreated control embryos/tissues should be processed for immuno-fluorescence and TEM simultaneously along with in situ NuMat embryos/tissues.\nAdd 1 mL PBT to the embryos/tissues in 1.5 mL microfuge tube and incubate the tube at 25°C for 20 min (Stabilization). This step can be omitted if stabilization is not deemed necessary. Discard supernatant by gentle aspiration.\nAdd 1 mL EB I (prepare and use on the same day) to the tube/chambered slide and incubate on rotating wheel/platform shaker at 40 rpm for 20 min at 25°C (salt extraction I).\nAllow embryos/tissues to settle down and discard supernatant by gentle aspiration. Add fresh 1 mL EB II (prepare and use on the same day) and incubate at 40 rpm for 20 min (salt extraction II).\nWash embryos/tissues three times (10 min each) with PBT by adding the buffer and rotating/shaking the tube/chambered slide at 40 rpm.\nAllow the tube to stand for 2 min to let the embryos/tissues settle at the bottom and remove the buffer by careful aspiration after the embryos/tissues settle down to the bottom of the tube.",
    "Allow embryos/tissues to settle down and discard supernatant. Add 100 μL of DB containing 2μL of DNase I (10 mg/mL) (prepare and use on the same day) and incubate at 37°C shaker incubator for 50 min at 200 rpm.\nNote: The temperature should be maintained at 37°C for efficient DNA digestion. For insufficient digestion with DNase I, refer to Problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nImproper fixation of samples may also result in under/over digestion and extraction of chromatin. In such a case, refer to Problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nRepeat step 15 for washing. The settled embryos/tissues with in situ NuMat prepared are ready for observation.\nSplit embryos/tissues from 1.5 mL microfuge tube to two microfuge tubes and proceed for immuno-fluorescence or TEM observations.\nImmuno-staining of in situ NuMat preparation\nOne of the most convenient and informative ways to study the components of nuclear architecture is to visualize their localization and abundance by immuno-staining. The next few steps describe the protocol to immuno-stain an in situ NuMat protein component. Dilutions of primary and secondary antibodies used have been mentioned in the Key Resources Table in brackets in the first column\nDilute primary antibody according to empirically optimized dilution and add to untreated control embryos/tissues and in situ NuMat in 0.5 mL PBT, seal tubes with parafilm and incubate with rotation for 3 h at 25°C. For tissue, the primary antibody dilution can be added to the chambered slide and incubated.\nNote: Alternatively, the primary antibody incubation can also be carried out for 12–16 h at 4°C.\nRepeat step 15 for washing.\nDilute secondary antibody according to empirically optimized dilution and add to untreated control embryos/tissues and in situ NuMat in 0.5 mL PBT, seal tubes with parafilm and incubate with rotation for 3 h at 25°C.",
    "Note: Secondary antibody is fluorescently labeled so all the steps following this till step 25 should be done in such a way that the sample is not exposed to direct light. For this, the tubes in which the secondary incubation is done should be well wrapped with aluminum foil to prevent exposure to light.\nRepeat step 15 for washing.\nAfter the last wash with PBT, allow the embryos/tissues to settle and discard supernatant with gentle aspiration. Transfer embryos/tissues on a glass slide by adding a small amount of PBT and pipetting the embryos/tissues along with the solution.\nNote: Use cut tips for pipetting out these embryos/tissues from the microfuge tubes and putting them on glass slides. Once the embryos/tissues have been transferred on the slide, discard excess solution from the slides with gentle aspiration without losing any material in the process.\nAdd mounting media along with DAPI in the required quantity.\nCritical: DAPI is potentially carcinogenic. Handle with care.\nGently place the coverslips with the help of a needle on top of the embryos/tissues preventing any air bubble to enter. Care should be taken not to squash the embryos/tissues. Seal the coverslip from sides by gently applying a transparent nail polish on all four sides of the cover slip.\nNote: These slides should be stored in boxes or slide book where they are not in contact with direct light.\nPause point: The slides can be scanned immediately or stored for 16 h at 4°C in slide boxes or slide books. However, these should be scanned within one day of preparation.",
    "The slides can be scanned using a confocal or multiphoton microscope. Here we have used Leica SP8 microscope to image the slides. All the images were taken with 20× and 63× objectives. The acquired images were processed using LAS X software to generate the projection images.\nProcessing of in situ NuMat preparation for TEM\nSometimes it might be desirable to look at the ultrastructure of the nuclear architecture at a higher resolution. This can be achieved by transmission electron microscopy imaging. The next few steps describe the same.\nFix untreated control embryos and in situ NuMat carrying embryos/tissues by adding 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer and incubating samples with rotation for 1 h at 4°C.\nCritical: Glutaraldehyde is toxic. Handle with care in a fume hood.\nLet the sample settle down under gravity and discard supernatant by gentle aspiration.\nWash the sample with 0.1 M cacodylate buffer three times by adding the cacodylate buffer, incubating with rotation for 5 min at 4°C, letting the sample to settle down under gravity and discarding the supernatant.\nPause point: The samples can be stored at 4°C for 12–16 h in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer after glutaraldehyde fixation.\nPostfix samples with 1% OsO4 in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer and incubate with rotation for 30 min at 4°C.\nCritical: OsO4 is extremely toxic. Handle with care in a fume hood. A face mask with protection eyewear and protection for skin contact is essential.\nDehydrate samples with 35% ethanol in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer and incubate with rotation for 10 min at 4°C.\nAllow samples to settle and discard supernatant.",
    "Repeat steps 31 and 32 with following concentrations of ethanol: 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, and 100%. Repeat the wash in 100% for one more time. Ethanol dilutions should be made fresh just before use.\nAdd ethanol:n-butyl alcohol (nBA) in 2:1 ratio and incubate with rotation at 25°C for 10 min. Ethanol:nBA dilutions should be made fresh just before use.\nAllow samples to settle and discard supernatant by gentle aspiration. Add ethanol:nBA in 1:2 ratio and incubate with rotation at 25°C for 10 min.\nAllow samples to settle down and discard supernatant by gentle aspiration. Add 100% n-BA and incubate with rotation at 25°C for 10 min.\nAllow samples to settle down and discard supernatant. Add n-BA:DGD in the ratio 2:1 and incubate with rotation at 60°C for 1 h nBA:DGD dilutions should be made fresh just before use.\nAllow samples to settle down and discard supernatant. Add n-BA:DGD in the ration 1:2 and incubate with rotation at 60°C for 1 h.\nAllow samples to settle down and discard supernatant. Add 100% DGD and incubate with rotation for 1 h.\nRepeat step 39.\nIncubate samples along with the DGD at 25°C to allow it to solidify. If samples are stuck on the side of the tube bring them to the bottom by pipetting little amount of DGD on the sides of the tube.\nPause point: The DGD embedded samples can be stored indefinitely at 25°C.\nCut the microfuge tubes with a sharp blade and take out the DGD block containing sample.\nTrim the sample and cut 70–90 nm thick sections using glass knife on an ultramicrotome at an angle of 10° and float the sections on water.\nTransfer the sections on a formvar coated copper grids using a loop and handle and allow to dry for 2 h.",
    "Remove embedding DGD by dipping the copper grids containing sections in n-BA and incubating for 12–16 h.\nDry grids. Observe and capture images using TEM at 120 V.\nCritical: Steps 42–46 should be done in dust free environment to avoid contamination of sections and EM grids."
