    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nExplant the heart-lung block from the donor animal\nTiming: 30 min\nNote: This section describes the removal of the heart-lung block from the donor animal that is sacrificed during this step. Careful dissection and thorough perfusion of the donor lung are indispensable to obtain a functional donor graft.\nAnesthetize the donor mouse.\nWeigh the donor animal and administer Buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) subcutaneously.\nPlace the mouse in an induction chamber and administer isoflurane (5 L O2/min, 5%) until the breathing rate is visibly reduced to 30–40 breaths/min and the animal is still.\nQuickly remove the animal from the induction chamber and perform orotracheal intubation with a 20 G catheter. The inhalative anesthesia leaves approximately 20 s to complete this step.\nConnect the intubated animal to the ventilator, and ventilate the animal at a frequency of 130/min with a tidal volume of 0.5 mL (for animals of 25–27 g) or 1.0 mL (for animals of 28–30 g), continuously administering 2%–3% isoflurane.\nNote: Orotracheal intubation in mice can be performed in different ways. Readers should be aware that the preparation of the animal by inhalation anesthesia only significantly shortens the available time to perform the intubation. In our hands, the anesthesia leaves enough time for using an intubation aid, suspending the animal from its incisors and placing the catheter intratracheally via a guidewire. Other methods of intubation may take more time and the addition of an intraperitoneal anesthetic should be discussed.\nPlace the mouse in a supine position, fix it to the operating plate with tape, and administer Thiopental (50 mg/kg) intraperitoneally to deepen the anesthesia.\nBroadly shave the thorax and abdomen.\nPerform a skin incision from the caudal abdomen up to the lower jaw using small surgical scissors.",
    "Carefully separate the salivary glands and dissect the trachea in between them. During this step, the correct placement of the endotracheal tube is visible through the tracheal wall.\nLoosely place a long ligature (5-0 silk, 20 cm length) around the trachea using rounded forceps.\nPerform a median laparotomy and gently push the intestine aside to display the inferior vena cava.\nGently push down the liver and gall bladder and perform a median sternotomy.\nIncise the diaphragm on both sides, push both sides of the ribcage aside and fix them to the operating plate using small pins.\nNote: Be careful not to cause rib fractures during this step as they may injure the lung parenchyma.\nRemove the thymic gland to expose the roots of the aorta and pulmonary artery.\nCritical: Take care not to damage any underlying blood vessels (innominate and subclavian arteries, superior venae cava) during this step. To avoid bleeding, do not apply too much tension on the thymus while removing it. It is not necessary to remove the thymus in its entirety during this step, as long as the aorta and pulmonary artery are clearly identified. After this step, the animal is now ready for perfusion. The relevant structures are depicted in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3112-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Donor animal prepared for perfusion\nThe pulmonary artery, the aorta, and the inferior vena cava are clearly visible.\nInject Heparin (100 U/kg) in the inferior vena cava.\nPerfuse the animal with 5–10 mL Perfadex Plus. Be aware that the following sub-steps (12 a-c) have to be performed in quick succession as the animal starts bleeding out.\nQuickly incise the inferior vena cava and the left auricular appendix.\nInsert a 21 G butterfly cannula at the root of the pulmonary artery.",
    "Perfuse the animal with 5–10 mL Perfadex Plus until the lungs are flushed bloodless and turn white. It is important to keep the lungs sufficiently ventilated during this step to achieve good perfusion. By the end of the procedure, a remaining slight redness along the periphery of the lung is normal (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nLigate the trachea and take the animal off the ventilator.\nChange the ventilator settings to a frequency of 100 breaths/min or lower and turn off the isoflurane addition.\nGently pull back the intubation cannula and ligate the trachea when the lung is at approximately 2/3 of its maximum expansion.\nRemove the intubation cannula and turn off the ventilator.\nCut the trachea above the ligature, and gently pull on the ligature while removing the heart-lung block from the donor animal by careful dissection.\nNote: We recommend working close along the spine as a guiding structure for this step, to avoid damage to the graft.\nPlace the heart-lung block on wet gauze on ice.\nPrepare the lung graft (Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1])\nTiming: 60 min\nNote: After the excision of the heart-lung block, the pulmonary graft is prepared. This step requires the microsurgical dissection of the pulmonary artery, pulmonary vein, and main bronchus. The three structures are then fixed on plastic cuffs to prepare the graft for implantation.\nPlace the heart-lung block on wet gauze in a petri dish filled with ice under the operating microscope.\nTo stabilize the tissue, place it on top of the wooden stem of a cotton swab.\nTo provide enough tension on the tissue for subsequent dissection, attach the trachea to the operating table by the ligature ends. This setup is depicted in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3112-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Placement of the heart-lung block for back-table preparation",
    "The position of the heart-lung block on a wooden stick as an abutment and stretching out the trachea provides the tissue with the necessary tension for further dissection (A). During preparation, the pulmonary ligament, pulmonary artery and the aortic arch should be visualized (B).\nGently cover the left lung with wet gauze to avoid injury to the parenchyma during the following operative steps.\nIdentify the pulmonary artery at its root and remove the surrounding fatty tissue using fine microsurgical forceps and spring scissors.\nCut the artery close to the bifurcation and separate it from the left main bronchus, all the way down to the left lung hilum.\nIdentify the bronchial bifurcation, cut the left main bronchus close to the bifurcation and separate it from the underlying esophagus down to the hilum (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nIdentify the left pulmonary vein, remove the surrounding fatty tissue, and cut off the vein at the influx to the left atrium. The left lung is now successfully separated from the rest of the heart-lung block (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nNote: While the pulmonary artery is quite elastic, and therefore resistant to tear strength, caution should be taken during the dissection of the bronchus and pulmonary vein. Regarding the bronchus, a tear in the membranous part is to be avoided. The pulmonary vein easily tears when not handled with care. We advise cutting the vein deep inside the left atrium, as the atrial tissue does not tear as easily as the venous wall. Generally, in order to avoid damage to the vessels and the bronchus, we advise to either grab structures as a whole or to manipulate the surrounding connective tissue.\nPlace the left lung on wet gauze on ice.",
    "Place the 22 G cuff in the adjustable helping hand tool by suspending it from a needle holder. The cuff should be placed above the hilum of the isolated left lung in a way that allows for a straight top view onto the cuff entrance, as depicted in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3112-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Position of the 22 G cuff suspended from a micro needle holder above the pulmonary vein\nThe straight top view through the cuff allows for a tension-free introduction of the vein through the cuff (A). The vein is then pulled through the cuff, slipped over it and fixed with a 10-0 ligature (B). In order to avoid an impairment of the venous flow after implantation, a caudal position of the venous cuff handle is recommended (C).\nGrab the pulmonary vein and gently pull it through the cuff from below with angled forceps.\nNote: As the thin venous walls are prone to tearing, we recommend handling the donor vein by grabbing it primarily at the attached atrial tissue. However, make sure that there is not too much excess tissue at the distal end of the vein, as this may hinder the passage through the narrow cuff.\nIdentify the venous lumen and pull the venous walls over the whole circumference of the cuff.\nFasten the vein on the cuff with a 10-0 ligature. The desired result is depicted in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B.\nRepeat steps 21–24 with the 26 G cuff for the pulmonary artery and the 20 G cuff for the bronchus, respectively. The recommended orientation of the cuffs on the donor organ is depicted in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C.\nRemove excess tissue around the cuffs at the bronchus and the vein.",
    "Note: Removal of the excess atrial tissue around the vein is critical in order to obtain a functional venous anastomosis, as it may cause obstruction of venous blood flow. Thus, make sure that the ligature is placed strictly around the thin venous wall and remove all excess atrial tissue after attaching the cuff.\nImplantation of the lung graft to the recipient animal (Methods Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2])\nTiming: 60 min\nNote: The following section describes the procedure of implanting the prepared graft to the recipient animal. This is the most challenging aspect of the lung transplant procedure. It requires the dissection of the recipient pulmonary artery, main bronchus, and pulmonary vein, a transient closure of the vasculature, and introduction of the donor cuffs into the respective recipient structures. During this procedure, the continuous visual control of the heartbeat and respective adjustments of the inhalation anesthetic is mandatory. Inhalation anesthesia should be adjusted to achieve a continuous heart rate of approx. 260 beats/min.\nAnesthetize the recipient mouse in the same fashion as described in step 1.\nPlace the mouse in a half-supine position turned toward its right side on a heated plate and attach it with tape.\nApply ointment to the eyes of the animal to keep them moist during the surgery.\nShave the left side of the thorax.\nIncise the skin right below the inferior angle of the scapula to perform a left-sided thoracotomy.\nDissect the muscle tissue until the intercostal spaces are visible.\nNote: During this step, small blood vessels between the muscles are visible. To avoid bleeding, use electrocautery on them.\nOpen the thoracic cavity through the fourth intercostal space right below the scapula, all the way from the sternum to the spine using blunt-tipped scissors, and insert a retractor.",
    "Note: This position offers the best access to the hilar structures of the recipient animal. Be careful not to cause rib fractures during this step, as the sharp edges will damage the lung.\nExtract the left recipient lung from the thoracic cavity by gently pushing it outwards using wet cotton swabs. Slight twisting movements are required to release the pulmonary ligament.\nHold the extracted lung outside the thorax with a vascular clip to obtain the necessary tension for dissection of the recipient hilum. Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] demonstrates the positioning of the animal and the way the lung can be extracted out of the thoracic cavity (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3112-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Position of the recipient animal for implantation\nThe lung is extracted from the thoracic cavity by a vessel clip attached to the retractor. This way, the pulmonary vessels and bronchus are stretched out for further dissection.\nPlace the animal under the operating microscope.\nDissect any remaining parts of the pulmonary ligament by pulling it apart using fine microsurgical forceps.\nFixate the lung outside the thoracic cavity so that a horizontal orientation of the hilar structures is achieved. Excessive tilting up- or downwards will impede the successful introduction of the donor cuffs.\nDissect the recipient hilar structures until a complete separation of pulmonary artery, left main bronchus, and left pulmonary vein is achieved, as depicted in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3112-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. View of the hilar structures before implantation\nNote the complete separation between the vein and bronchus. The superior vena cava crossing the central structures can be gently pushed further towards the heart using cotton swabs.\nTo dissect the pulmonary artery, grab the connective tissue around the proximal part of the artery close to the heart and carefully separate the artery from the main bronchus.",
    "Note: The murine pulmonary artery is very resistant to tear stress. Once any separation of artery and bronchus is achieved, angled microsurgical forceps can be placed underneath the artery and the structure can be freed easily from the surrounding connective tissue with spreading movements. At the peripheral part of the artery close to the parenchyma, an additional layer of stronger connective tissue can be found that should be pulled apart to achieve a complete separation of the artery.\nNext, the bronchus is separated from the vein by slowly pulling apart the connective tissue between the two structures.\nNote: For separating the bronchus from the vein, we recommend starting close to the heart and working your way all the way up to the recipient hilum. Make sure not to damage the membranous part of the bronchus that is bulging outwards during ventilation.\nNote: It is important to dissect the hilar structures for their entire length and circumference. Leftover connective tissue between the structures significantly limits the available space left for placement of the cuffs and ligatures during implantation.\nPlace 10-0 ligatures or vessel clips around the vascular structures and tie them down close to the heart.\nNote: Transient central closure of the vascular structures can alternatively be performed using vessel clips. However, we have good experience with ligatures, as they leave more space for the anastomosis procedure. Alternatively, slipknots can be used to facilitate reopening of the vascular structures.\nLoosely place three 10-0 ligatures around the artery, vein and bronchus to prepare for fastening of the donor cuffs (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nPlace the prepared donor graft wrapped in a thin wet piece of gauze on top of the recipient lung in the correct orientation.\nImplant the graft by introducing the vascular donor structures into the respective recipient vessels (troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).",
    "Note: The sequence of implantation can be changed according to the individual surgeon’s preference. In this protocol, we describe our preferred sequence. We recommend starting by introducing the vein, as this is usually the shortest donor structure. Thus, greater flexibility of the donor graft can facilitate its introduction. Next, we prefer to introduce the artery and finish the procedure with the bronchial anastomosis. However, others may prefer the introduction of the bronchus before the arterial anastomosis, as the attached bronchial cuff may provide further stability for the introduction of the flexible artery.\nMake a small incision in the recipient vein close to the donor lung parenchyma. The incision should span a quarter of the vessel’s circumference.\nNote: The size and site of the incision of the recipient structures is critical for successful introduction of the donor cuffs – especially regarding the vein. If the incision is too small, trying to insert the cuff will cause longitudinal tearing of the recipient structure. On the other hand, large incisions make the introduction of the cuff virtually impossible, and may cause further vertical tearing.\nShortly flush the recipient vein with Perfadex Plus to clearly identify its lumen.\nInsert the venous donor cuff into the recipient vein and push the cuff forward as much as possible to achieve a central anastomosis of the vein.",
    "Note: Tears in the recipient structures during introduction of the cuffs can be avoided by applying the following strategy: Clearly visualize the lumen of the recipient structure before attempting to introduce the cuff. Lodge the upper rim of the cuff underneath the top edge of the recipient structure by slightly angling the cuff downwards (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]). Small sideways movements will help to place the cuff in between the side walls of the recipient structure. Before pushing the cuff into the recipient structure, make sure the cuff is orientated strictly parallel to the backside of the recipient structure otherwise the backside of the structure will inevitably tear when trying to introduce the cuff. As the arterial wall is quite resistant to tear stress, this is especially relevant for the vein and bronchus.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3112-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Movement for the implantation of the donor cuffs\nFirst, angle the cuff downward to lodge it underneath the upper rim of the recipient structure. Then, place the cuff strictly parallel to the recipient structure before pushing it forward in order to avoid injury to the back wall of the respective structure (marked in red).\nFixate the cuff inside the recipient vein using the prepared 10-0 ligature (troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nRepeat the process (steps 40a-d) for the arterial anastomosis.\nNote: As the diameter of the artery is smaller than that of the vein, take care not to cut into it too deeply. We recommend flushing the structure in order to clearly identify its lumen before making any attempt to introduce the donor cuff. Following this advice can reduce the likelihood of introducing the cuff into a false lumen created by surrounding connective tissue.\nCreate the bronchial anastomosis.\nMake a small incision in the recipient left main bronchus directly in between two cartilage braces close to the parenchyma.",
    "Quickly introduce the donor bronchial cuff into the structure and gently push forward.\nNote: Be aware that the animal is not sufficiently ventilated once the main bronchus is incised. Therefore, it is critical to quickly introduce the donor cuff to achieve a closure of the airway and sufficient ventilation.\nFasten the cuff with the prepared ligature. The result is shown in Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3112-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. View of the hilum after implantation of the donor structures\nInitiate reperfusion of the graft by opening the central ligatures.\nOpen the central ligature on the vein and check the graft for venous backflow. Rapid venous backflow is a reliable indicator for a functional venous anastomosis.\nOpen the central ligature on the artery and observe the immediate arterial perfusion of the graft.\nCarefully observe the color of the graft changing from white to light pink.\nNote: The color change of the graft is a reliable predictor of the outcome. A change to a slight pink color shows an optimal match between the arterial blood supply and venous drainage. Insufficient venous drainage due to mechanical constriction causes a red discoloration of the graft. Slight manipulation with a cotton swab or shortening of the venous cuff handle can ameliorate venous blood flow. It is important to check for discoloration of the graft with every change of its position.\nPlace the graft inside the thoracic cavity in the correct anatomic position using moist cotton swabs.\nRemove the recipient’s lung by cutting off its vessels and bronchus close to its hilum.\nRemove the retractor and loosely place a continuous pericostal 5-0 Prolene suture across the full length of the thoracotomy.\nRe-inflate the pulmonary graft by applying positive end-expiratory pressure by shortly closing the expiratory loop of the ventilator.",
    "Tighten and close the pericostal suture immediately after the re-inflation of the pulmonary graft to prevent residual pneumothorax.\nClose the skin incision with metal clips.\nTurn off the isoflurane addition and slowly let the animal wake up. Remove the tracheal tube once spontaneous breathing resumes.\nInject the animal with Buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) subcutaneously.\nPostoperative care\nWe recommend single housing of the recipient animals during the first postoperative days.\nObserve the recipient animal regularly over the first 2–4 postoperative days as obstruction of the vascular anastomosis may impair the animal’s well-being during this time.\nPain medication should be provided in accordance with your respective institutional permission. In our Institution, 30 min before the start of surgery, the mice are administered Buprenorphine at a concentration of 0.1 mg per kg body weight and Metamizole at a concentration of 200 mg per kg body weight subcutaneously. In the recipient mice for analgesic treatment, Buprenorphine at a concentration of 0.1 mg per kg body weight is administered subcutaneously to the mice every 8 h for 3 days from the end of surgery. For further analgesic treatment, the mice also receive Metamizole via drinking water (see “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]”; temperature 22°C–23°C and maximum storage 24 h) from one day before surgery, until two days after surgery. Metamizole is administered at a dose of 1200 mg / kg body weight (200 mL water, 5% glucose and 40 drops, equivalent to 1000 mg). Mouse cages are kept on a hot plate for the first 6 postoperative hours. The mice are observed for pain and complications every hour for the first 6 postoperative hours, then every 8 h until the third postoperative day. Thereafter, the mice are examined daily until the time of euthanization.\nExtravasation assay\nTiming: 1–2 h per mouse",
    "Note: This part of the protocol describes the extravasation assay using intravenous tail vein injection of MC38-GFP cells following the lung transplantation.\nPrepare cancer cells.\nResuspend aliquoted cancer cells (5 million cells per mL) by aspiring them thrice with a 21-gauge needle and a 1 mL syringe.\nCarefully aspire 100 μL of the resuspended cancer cells with a 27-gauge needle and a 1 mL syringe.\nCritical: Avoid air bubbles.\n14 days after lung transplantation, we perform the extravasation assay. Anesthetize one mouse by using an appropriate induction chamber with an oxygen flow of 500 mL/min with 5% nebulized isoflurane until the inter-toe reflex is lost.\nMaintain anesthesia by using the same oxygen flow with 2%–3% isoflurane provided via a mask.\nDilate the tail vein by applying infrared light for approximately 20 s (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3112-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. Intravenous injection of cancer cells\n(A) Schematic view of intravenous injection of cancer cells.\n(B) Application of infrared light to dilatate the tail vein.\n(C) A purple straight line was seen while the mouse tail was stretched.\n(D) A smooth insert of needle tip into the tail vein.\nCritical: Avoid thermically damaging the tail by holding your finger next to the tail to evaluate if the heat is becoming too strong.\nNote: Alternatively, the tail can be positioned in a water bath heated to 38° for 20 s.\nPosition the mouse on its right or left side.\nHold the tail with your non-dominant hand and stretch it into a straight line. The tail vein should be visible as a purple, straight line facing up (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]C).\nInsert the tip of your needle in a 10° angle into the tail vein. The needle should slide in the vein very easily once you are inside the lumen of the vein (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]D).",
    "Slowly inject 100 μL of your cell suspension.\nCritical: The injection has to feel very smooth, and a short whitening of the tail vein has to be observed. If a resistance can be felt while injecting and if a whitening of one area around the injection side can be observed, intravenous injection was not successful.\nAfter injection, wait 30 s with the needle still inside the vein.\nQuickly remove the needle and immediately press a sterile gauze on the vein for 20 s.\nRemove the gauze and check that no further bleeding from the vein occurs.\nPlace the mouse back into its cage and monitor it until it is fully awake.\n24 h later, euthanize mice according to your local guidelines.\nDisinfect mice using 70% ethanol.\nOpen the thoracic cavity and the cervical part of the mice until the chin.\nCut the left ventricle of the heart.\nInsert a 21-gauge needle into the right ventricle of the heart and flush the mouse with 5–10 mL PBS.\nNote: During this step, the lungs will turn from pink to white.\nDissect each lung by carefully removing the aorta, esophagus, vena cava, diaphragm, and the heart.\nStore each lung in RPMI 1640 medium containing 1% FBS on ice.\nCut each lung into small pieces and digest the pieces using HBSS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+) containing Collagenase (1 mg/mL) and DNase I (10 U/mL) on a shaker at 37°C for 25 min.\nSmash each lung into a single cell suspension using a 100 μm cell strainer. Wash the cells using 1% FBS in PBS and fill up to 50 mL.\nCentrifuge the cells at 400 × g for 8 min and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 1 mL PBS to resuspend the cells and take 100 μL for flow cytometry.",
    "Note: Always prepare a sample from a mouse injected with the same cell line but without fluorescence as a gating control.\nAdd 1 mL MACS buffer (see “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]”; temperature 4°C and maximum storage 1–2 weeks) to wash the cells and centrifuge again at 400 × g for 8 min.\nResuspend the cells with counting beads diluted in MACS buffer (1:10) and acquire the data using flow cytometry (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3112-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10. FACS plot of MC38shC and MC38 GFP-labeled cells\nNote: Alternatively, another approach to count cell numbers in each sample could be used.\nCalculate the number of extravasated cells and analyze."
