    "Prepare slides (to be used in D. Sperm size assay; E. Sperm activation assay; F. Qualitative mitochondrial morphology assay; and G. Quantitative mitochondrial fusion assay).Using a PAP pen, draw circles of 1-1.5 cm in diameter on the microscope slides.Note: One standard slide will easily fit two grease circles, with room to cover each individually (when using 22 × 22 mm square cover slips). Allow to dry overnight (or > 2 h in lamellar flow hood).Prepare malesMaintain the growth of males in the strains needed for the assay.Notes: Thirty to forty males are needed for sperm number assay; at least five males are needed per replicate of sperm size, activation, and mitochondrial assays. This number is easily obtained from a mixed population of males and hermaphrodites. To ensure the propagation of males in the strains used, transfer young adult males and hermaphrodites (3:1 ratio) to fresh plates 4-5 days prior to picking males for the assay. If mating ability and/or male fertility is impaired, males should be mated to hermaphrodites (3:1 ratio) overnight on NGM plates seeded with 20 μl of 25× OP50-1 (see Recipe 1i Note for further detail) and transferred to stock NGM plates. The smaller food spots increase the frequency of encounters between males and hermaphrodites, thus increasing the likelihood of successful mating. Mate animals 4-5 days prior to picking males for the assay. If larger numbers of animals are desired, populations can be synchronized by alkaline hypochlorite treatment of a mixed population of males and hermaphrodites as described before (Yen and Curran, 2020). To ensure you have enough males, only use populations with approximately 50% of males. Pick larval stage 4 (L4) virgin males to stock NGM plates free of hermaphrodites on the day prior to assay (consult WormAtlas (Altun et al.",
    ", 2021) for further information on identifying L4 males).Notes: Picking L4 males ensures that premature activation does not occur via mating prior to the assays. Males should be prepared in this way for all assays, except for qualitative mitochondrial morphology, for which the MitoTracker dye should be applied to food prior to transferring males to the plates (see Procedure F). Males tend to crawl off plates in search of hermaphrodites if isolated for too long; if this becomes a problem, some loss of males can be prevented by allowing hermaphrodites (preferably gravid, unmated ones) to crawl on seeded NGM to scent it with pheromones and removing them before transferring males to plate. Incubate for 18-24 h at 20 °C.Sperm number assayWash male worms from isolation plate with PBS + 0.01% Triton X-100 (PBST) in a 1.5 ml tube.Centrifuge for 1 min at 560 × g. Remove supernatant to 0.1 ml (use marks on the tube as a guide).Wash 1-2 additional times with PBST.Note: These washes remove E. coli from the worms to be stained. Wash until the supernatant removed is clear (and not cloudy with bacteria). Do not wash beyond this point. Additional washes increase the likelihood of losing worms while aspirating the supernatant. Centrifuge for 1 min at 560 × g. Remove supernatant to 0.1 ml.Add 600 μl of 40% isopropanol and rotate for 3 min at room temperature to fix worms.While worms are fixing, make staining solution: dilute 1 mg/ml DAPI stock solution to 10 μg/ml in 40% isopropanol (10 μl DAPI per 1 ml 40% isopropanol).Centrifuge for 1 min at 560 × g. Remove supernatant to 0.1 ml.Add 600 μl of staining solution and incubate in the dark for 5 min.Centrifuge for 1 min at 560 × g. Remove supernatant to 0.1 ml.",
    "Add 600 μl PBST and incubate in the dark for 30 min to destain.Mount samples on microscope slides (regular slides, not those prepared in Procedure A) with Vectashield mounting medium.Cover with a cover slip and seal the edges with nail polish. Allow to dry (in the dark) for 5-10 min.Image at 40-63× with DIC and DAPI filters, ensuring all spermatids are visible in each worm.Note: Spermatids should be restricted to the seminal vesicle in male worms and can be distinguished from other germ cells by their compact nuclei. Collect z-stacks of each seminal vesicle, ensuring all spermatids are captured (use 40× if needed to zoom out to include all spermatids). A representative image is shown in Figure 1.Note: Set bounds at upper and lower edges of the seminal vesicle (where the first spermatid is visible on each side of the seminal vesicle) and image at a z-plane distance of 0.25 microns. This distance is determined by the auto settings of the Zeiss imaging software. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4035/bioprotoc-11-11-4035-g001.jpgFigure 1. DAPI-stained spermatids in the seminal vesicle. The worm is positioned with the anterior region to the left and posterior to the right. The seminal vesicle is outlined in yellow. Scale bar, 20 μm.Sperm size assayClean worms to get rid of E. coli. Cleaning can be done in one of two ways. For the first method, pipet two drops of ~15 μl M9 onto a Petri dish lid and use a platinum wire worm pick to transfer 5 day one adult virgin males to a drop of M9. Using an eyelash brush, transfer the worms into the second M9 drop before moving them into the SM buffer on the prepared slide.",
    "For the second method, use a platinum pick to transfer >5 day one adult virgin males to an unseeded NGM plate and allow them to crawl from the food spot. Then use a clean platinum pick (without bacteria) to transfer 5 males from the unseeded plate to the SM buffer on the prepared slide. Carefully move the worms individually at each transfer step. Picking up worms without food requires practice and is done in a scooping motion where the pick goes below the worm.Pipet 35 μl of SM buffer containing dextrose into the grease circle on the prepared slide (from Procedure A).Transfer 5 clean virgin males to the SM buffer on the slide using either an eyelash brush or a platinum pick, depending on how the animals were cleaned (see Step D1).Under a dissecting microscope, dissect worms to release the sperm.Using a scalpel or two 25-gauge needles (slide flat surfaces of needles across each other mimicking scissor blades), slice males between the midpoint and tail (approximately 1/3 body length from the tail).Note: Move rapidly as dissected sperm may be sensitive to changes in salt concentration and/or pH resulting from evaporation. Sterilize the scalpel or needles between samples by dipping in ≥ 70% ethanol and passing through a Bunsen burner flame. Allow to cool before use.Cover dissected spermatids with a cover slip.Seal with nail polish.Image with a 100× objective using a DIC filter. A representative image is shown in Figure 2.Complete imaging as quickly as possible because spontaneous activation has been observed when isolated spermatids are left for prolonged periods. In experienced hands, this should take no more than 5 min.Score only spherical cells and at least 100 per replicate.Note: Typically, 100 spermatids are easy to obtain from one slide of five dissected day one adult males.",
    "This is attainable from imaging approximately 5-10 fields. The number of fields imaged depends on how the dissection spreads them on the slides. It may help to keep a rough mental count on the number of spermatids while imaging; always take a few extra images. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4035/bioprotoc-11-11-4035-g002.jpgFigure 2.

Scale bar, 10 μm.Sperm activation assayPrepare a humid chamber (Figure 3)Place a wet paper towel on the bottom of a lidded container. Cover with a sheet of parafilm to create a dry surface to place slides on.Cover with the lid.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4035/bioprotoc-11-11-4035-g003.jpgFigure 3. DIY humid chamber in open (A) and closed (B) configurations Prepare the Pronase working solution (see Recipes) and SM containing BSA and 400 ng/μl of Pronase.After the Pronase working solution is completely dissolved, dilute 4 μl in 96 μl of SM buffer containing BSA.Clean worms to remove E. coli (see Procedure D for details).Pipet 35 μl of SM buffer containing BSA into the grease circle on the prepared slide (from Procedure A).Note: Activation assays are done using SM buffer containing BSA rather than Dextrose. We have tested with both supplements and noted that BSA is needed for activation. Transfer 5 clean virgin males to the SM buffer on the slide using either an eyelash brush or a platinum pick, depending on how animals were cleaned (see Step D1a).Under a dissecting microscope, dissect worms to release the sperm (see Procedure D for instructions).After dissecting the final male, add 35 μl of SM buffer containing BSA and 400 ng/μl Pronase.Incubate in the humid chamber (covered) for 15 min.",
    "Note: In our hands, 15 min activates approximately 80% of WT spermatids, but the activation is sensitive to multiple factors, including handling time, temperature, and freshness of buffer components. The incubation length may need to be determined empirically on an individual basis. During the incubation, prepare the cover slip.Using forceps or a pipette tip, create a thin line of petroleum jelly around the edges of the coverslip.Note: We have found that sealing the slides with nail polish affects activation and thus use only petroleum jelly to seal slides for this assay. After 15 min, cover the dissected animals with the prepared cover slip. Do not seal further.Image with a 100× objective using a DIC filter. A representative image is shown in Figure 4.Notes: Because sperm may be in different focal planes, and pseudopods of activated spermatids may be difficult to see in a single image, we recommend imaging each field of view in two different focal planes to aid in scoring (this distance need not be precisely measured). The second image serves as an aid in determining the activation status of spermatids that are unclear in the first one. Often, the movement of pseudopods in the time between capturing the images also helps reveal details that might not be evident in a single image. Because the cover slip is adhered to the slide using only surface tension, changing objectives after oil immersion may cause it to shift or come off completely. For this reason, examine the slide using a lower magnification (non-oil immersion) objective before imaging. Do not return to a lower power objective after immersion oil is applied. Ensure all imaging is complete within the first 5 min after the incubation is complete (20 min after adding SM/Pronase solution).Score at least 100 spermatids per replicate.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4035/bioprotoc-11-11-4035-g004.jpgFigure 4.",

    "Transfer 5 cleaned virgin males to the SM buffer on the slide using either an eyelash brush or a platinum pick, depending on how animals were cleaned (see Step D1a).Under a dissecting microscope, dissect worms to release the sperm (see Procedure D for instructions).After dissecting the final male, add 25 μl of SM buffer containing BSA and JC-1.Incubate in the humid chamber (covered) for 10 min.Wash three times with 100 μl of SM buffer containing BSA (no JC-1).Be careful to avoid completely removing the liquid from dissected spermatids, as this will affect spermatid physiology (and therefore mitochondrial phenotypes).Be careful to avoid overflowing the grease circle and losing the sample. If necessary, use smaller wash volumes (80-90 μl).Cover the dissected animals with a cover slip and seal with nail polish.Image with a 100× objective using AlexaFluor488 (Green) and AlexaFluor546 (Red) channels. Representative images are shown in Figure 6.Note: JC-1 is a mitochondria-specific dye that reflects changes in membrane potential. The ratio of red fluorescence (high membrane potential mitochondria species) to green fluorescence (low membrane potential mitochondria species) is a commonly used metric of mitochondrial health (Sivandzade et al., 2019). Collect z-stacks of spermatids to be scored.Note: Collect 8-9 images with a spacing of 0.8 microns in the z-plane. Ensure imaging is complete within 10 min, as spermatids are alive (not fixed) and can undergo mitochondrial changes.Score only spherical cells.Score at least 40 spermatids per replicate.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210527/20210527011752_8831.jpgFigure 6.
