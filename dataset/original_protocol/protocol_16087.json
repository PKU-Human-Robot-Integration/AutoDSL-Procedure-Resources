Weigh mice using a high-precision laboratory scale and place animals on a 37°C mouse heating pad to maintain body temperature. Record weights over the course of treatment (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-fig-0001]).\n3. Measure both left and right ear thickness using a precision-dial thickness gauge under light anesthesia (Fig. 1D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-fig-0001], see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-prot-0002]).",
    "4. Topically, apply 1 nM MC903 in 100% absolute ethyl alcohol (EtOH) using a 2-20 µl pipette to both sides of each ear (10 μl on dorsal and ventral ear sides for a total volume of 20 μl per ear) on every treatment day according to the treatment regimen (Fig. 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-fig-0001]). Control mice are treated in parallel with the same volume of EtOH (as a vehicle control) only.\n5. After the treatment, keep animals on a 37°C mouse heating pad to maintain constant body temperature during recovery, then return to cages.\n6. Over the next 2 weeks (see treatment regimen, Fig. 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-fig-0001]), repeat measurements before topical application of MC903 or EtOH (steps 2-5). A total of 7 applications of MC903 or EtOH will be applied, with the final topical application on day 14.\nDay 14: Itch assessment\n7. On day 14, 24 hr before the experimental endpoint, record a video of the mice and quantify itch events via time-lapse videography. Determine and quantify itch events for 30 min (see Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-prot-0003]).\nDay 15: Experimental endpoint\n8. At the experimental endpoint (day 15), euthanize mice by CO2 asphyxiation, repeat measurements (step 3), and harvest ear skin tissues using sterile sharp scissors and forceps (Alam et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-bib-0001], Mac-Daniel, Buckwalter, Gueirard, & Ménard, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-bib-0009]). For ear draining lymph nodes, carefully cut the skin at the corresponding neck region and dissect the auricular lymph nodes (Alam et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-bib-0001], Mac-Daniel et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-bib-0009]) (see Support Protocols 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-prot-0004]–5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-prot-0006]).",
    "The topical application of MC903 can induce AD-like skin inflammation, and an increase in the thickening of ear skin is considered a surrogate marker for skin inflammation (Alam et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-bib-0001], Naidoo et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-bib-0011], Moosbrugger-Martinz et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-bib-0010]). The time course of ear skin inflammation can be monitored by measuring the ear skin thickness with a dial thickness gauge (Alam et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-bib-0001], Naidoo et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-bib-0011], Xie et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-bib-0012]).\nMaterials\n70% (v/v) ethanol\nPrecision-dial thickness gauge (Peacock, Ozaki Mfg. Co. Ltd, cat. no. GA-1)\n1. Thoroughly wipe the dial thickness gauge with 70% ethanol. Place anesthetized animals on a 37°C mouse heating pad to maintain constant body temperature (see Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-prot-0001]). Measure and record both the right and left ear skin thickness with a dial thickness gauge (Fig. 1D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-fig-0001]).\nIt is critical to measure the same skin areas on each treatment day. Measure the thickness of ear skin gently with little-to-no compression. After each measurement, wipe the dial thickness gauge with 70% ethanol to avoid cross-contamination of MC903 and EtOH-treated ears.\n2. On each treatment day, repeat measurements before the MC903 or EtOH treatment.\n3. Calculate and plot the percent increase in skin thickness compared with day 0 baseline values (Fig. 1E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-fig-0001]).",
    "Itching is one of the hallmarks of AD, and itch-evoked scratching increases because of the MC903 treatment (Alam et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-bib-0001], Naidoo et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-bib-0011]). Itch frequency is determined and quantified on a recorded video captured at 24 hr before the experimental endpoint, for a period of 30 min.\nMaterials\nMicroisolator cage type II\nVideo recorder\n1. On day 14, place mice in a clear Microisolator type II cage (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-fig-0002]). Record a video via time-lapse videography and quantify itch events for 30 min (Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-fig-0002]).\nAn itching event is defined as a deliberate scratching activity directed at the treated skin by either the front or hind paws. This pathophysiology measurement was obtained from the video observation of the relevant treatment groups 24 hr before the experimental endpoint, as described previously (Alam et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-bib-0001], Lee et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-bib-0006], Naidoo et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-bib-0011])\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5f7ae94a-1828-4b57-a054-c3d79d60d560/cpz1695-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nMC903 induces itch-evoked scratching in C57BL/6J WT mice.

    "An important characteristic of the MC903-induced atopic dermatitis mouse model is the ability to recapitulate the structural changes associated with AD skin inflammation, including acanthosis, thickening of the dermis, parakeratosis, presence of spongiosis, and inflammatory lymphocyte infiltrates in the dermis (Alam et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-bib-0001], Li et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-bib-0008], Moosbrugger-Martinz et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-bib-0010]) (Fig. 3D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-fig-0003], E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-fig-0003], and F[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-fig-0003]).\nMaterials\n10% neutral buffered formalin\nHematoxylin-eosin (H&E) solution\nForceps, sterile, surgical\nScissors, sterile, surgical\nMicroscope slides\nAperio ImageScope software\nImageJ software (National Institutes of Health)\nAdditional reagents and equipment for standard methods of sectioning fixed tissue and staining with H&E (Moosbrugger-Martinz et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.695#cpz1695-bib-0010]).\n1.
