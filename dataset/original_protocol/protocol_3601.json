    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nImmobilizing zebrafish larvae\nTiming: 5–10 min\nImmobilize the larvae with 1.2% low-melting point agarose in a self-designed 35-mm plastic dish with a glass coverslip-filled well. Then incubate the larvae with ES, and remove the agarose around the larva’s mouth and tail with a fine-tipped forceps to leave space for larva growth (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nNote: For making the dish, we drilled a hole in the lid of a commercial petri dish, then glued a circular or square glass coverslip to fill the hole.\nCritical: Removing agarose to leave free space for the mouth and tail of the larva is important for relieving mechanical restriction on the growing body length of the larva. Do not skip this step.\nImaging for Ca2+ activity and morphology of ETCs\nTiming: 3–6 h\nPrepare the Nikon FN1 confocal microscope equipped with a 25× (NA 1.1) or 40× (NA 0.8) water-immersion objective and a heating system with the incubation temperature of 28°C.\nOpen the NIS-Elements Viewer imaging software, and set parameters for the time-lapse imaging. Use lasers of 488 nm and 561 nm to excite GCaMP5 (for Ca2+ activity) and mCherry (for morphology) of ETCs, respectively.\nIdentify ETCs for imaging. Place the larva-contained dish under the objective lens of the microscope, find the field of the brain using bright field. Perform a XYZ image of the brain vascular network with GCaMP5 and mCherry at the Z-axis resolution of 4 μm to identify CVP located peripherally in the midbrain. Then identify the ETCs budding from the CVP and extending into the midbrain with several sub-cellular branches and numerous filopodia in the image (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C). Finally, move the confocal plane in Z-axis to the identified ETC for the following imaging process.",
    "Perform time-lapse imaging for the selected ETC for 3 – 6 h (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). The spatial resolution for images is 0.2–0.4 μm per pixel, the Z-axis resolution is 4 μm, and the interval for Z-projected time-lapse images is ∼ 6 s. During the imaging process, include separated imaging cassettes with time length of 30 min. At the beginning of each imaging cassette, refresh ES solution in the dish through removing old solution and supplementing fresh solution to maintain the larva in a good condition, and reset the bottom-/up- imaging boundary in Z-axis to cover the complete morphology of the ETC.\nCritical: The interval for Z-projected time-lapse images is an important parameter in this imaging experiment, and too long imaging interval (e.g., larger than half time of the duration of Ca2+ transients) should be avoided, as it could miss Ca2+ transients with relative small duration. Based on our imaging data, the average duration of Ca2+ transients in ETCs is 40.4 ± 2.3 s. We used the interval of ∼ 6 s in our experiments, which is just enough for capturing Ca2+ transients in ETCs. Consistently, Yokota et al used 5 s as the interval for monitoring Ca2+ oscillations of ECs in larval zebrafish (Yokota et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). Some ETCs engage the widely distributed morphology in the Z-axis, and more optical sections in Z-axis are required to cover the complete morphology of the ETC, and a longer imaging interval is needed as a result. For this condition, these ETCs should be avoided for imaging.\nNote: To avoid large fluctuation of the imaging region in Z-axis during time-lapse imaging, it is important to include separated imaging cassettes according to the imaging time length with reset of bottom-/up- imaging boundary in Z-axis for each imaging cassette.\nAnalysis of Ca2+ imaging data\nTiming: 3 h",
    "Ratiometric analysis of Ca2+ activities of ETCs in Tg(kdrl:GCaMP5,kdrl:HRAS-mCherry) larvae using ImageJ (NIH) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/526-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Pipeline and example case for ratiometric analysis of Ca2+ activities in ETCs\nThis procedure consists of adjust properties of the 8-bit series (A), selection of the reference image (B), align series with the reference image (C), background subtraction (D), ROI selection (E), gray-scale value extraction (F), plot F values in image series (G), generation of R values (H), calculation of R0 (I), and calculation of ΔR/R0 (J). For each step, example operation with ImageJ (A–F) or plotted Ca2+ trace (G–J) is displayed.\nAdjust the properties of the time-lapse images, including unit of length (micron), pixel width/height, and voxel depth (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Then export the image series into a Z-axis projected “tif” image file with the type of 8 bit.\nTo correct movement of images within the same time-lapse image series, all images should be aligned with the reference image. Choose one image with obvious Ca2+ activity and relatively least movement at X-Y plane as the reference image in the GCaMP5 image series (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B), then align the analyzed images series with the reference image along X-Y plane using the Translation Transformation plugin (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nNote: Images with the same sequential number should be used for the reference images in the GCaMP5 and mCherry image series in the same time-lapse imaging data.\nSubtract the background of the analyzed image series and draw the region of interest (ROI) manually to outline the morphology of ETC branches, soma, or other sub-cellular structures, then quantify the gray-scale value of each ROI as F (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D–2G).\nGenerate R values with the ratio of FGCaMP5/FmCherry (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H).",
    "Calculation of R0. Plot R values with the ascending order, the averaged value of the first 100 frames is defined as R0 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I).\nNote: The number of frames used for calculating the average value in generating R0 depends on the length of the analyzed time-lapse image series. It is important that R values within the Ca2+ transients of ETCs should be avoided for R0 calculation. Usually, 100 frames are enough for calculating R0 in an image series containing about 300 frames.\nCalculate ΔR/R0 with the equation of (R − R0)/R0 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]J).\nCalculate the peak magnitude, duration, and number of Ca2+ transients with a self-written MATLAB program (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/526-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Pipeline and example case showing quantification of Ca2+ transients in ETCs\n(A) Pipeline showing the algorithm in the self-written MATLAB program for quantifying Ca2+ transients in ETCs based on the dataset of ΔR/R0.\n(B) Example showing Ca2+ traces before (top panels) and after (bottom panels) baseline subtraction and quantification for Ca2+ transients. The same Ca2+ traces were used as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]. In the top panels, the yellow thick and dashed lines indicate the smoothed baseline and the threshold for potential Ca2+ transients (marked by pink dots on the top) upon convergence, respectively. In the bottom panels, the baseline (black thick line) has been removed from the raw data, and the actual Ca2+ transients are annotated (pink lines with circles indicating the peaks). Area, the total area of Ca2+ transients in the calculated trace; event number, the number of Ca2+ transients; mean amplitude, the averaged peak value of Ca2+ transients.\nTo exclude the effect of possible fluctuation of the baseline of Ca2+ activities during in vivo long-term imaging, an adaptive and iterative algorithm to detect Ca2+ transients was designed, as briefly introduced as follows,",
    "Iterate the two steps until convergence: first, calculate a smoothed baseline from a baseline set; second, update the baseline set by removing potential Ca2+ transients from the smoothed baseline. Values larger than 3 times of standard deviation (STD) are considered as data points in a potential Ca2+ transient.\nNote: For very sharp fluctuation in the baseline of Ca2+ traces, errors may happen in predicting the data in the baseline as in the Ca2+ transient. To solve this problem, data before and after the fluctuation point should be separately analyzed.\nUpon convergence, define actual Ca2+ transients as the potential Ca2+ transients with duration longer than 15 s.\nNote: Our previous data (Liu et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]) and other literature (Yokota et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]) showed that the duration of spontaneous Ca2+ transients of ETCs is usually larger than 15 s in zebrafish larvae. Therefore, we define the duration of 15 s as the criteria for defining actual Ca2+ transients. This value could be adapted with some special properties of Ca2+ transients in imaged ETCs during analysis.\nGenerate the final-baseline-subtracted Ca2+ trace and quantify Ca2+ transient properties based on this trace.\nCopy the dataset containing time and ΔR/R0 values into an Microsoft Excel data file with the column title of “Time (s)” and “Delta R/R0,” respectively (see example data file, Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/526-Mmc1.xlsx]).\nRun the MATLAB script (Data S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/526-Mmc2.zip]) and select the data file(s) when prompted. The script will show the iteration process, the final baseline-subtracted Ca2+ trace, and the quantification data including the area, mean amplitude, and number of Ca2+ transients.",
    "Critical: The baseline and Ca2+ transients of the baseline-subtracted Ca2+ trace should be further confirmed with the Ca2+ trace before baseline subtraction through graphs plotted from this program, to ensure proper background removal and Ca2+ transient detection. The three parameters in the script can be adjusted if necessary (the baseline smooth window, the number of standard deviation that defines the threshold of potential transients, and the minimal duration that defines the actual Ca2+ transients). In addition, for errors caused by identified artificial Ca2+ transients because of large movements of images instead of actual Ca2+ activity of ETCs, it should be corrected manually in the process of quantification for Ca2+ transients, through removing the calculation for these Ca2+ transients including the area, amplitude, and number of Ca2+ transients.",
    "Critical: For the kinetics of Ca2+ transients in ETCs, we collected our imaging data and performed analysis on 79 Ca2+ transients of branches from 22 ETCs, and 32 Ca2+ transients of somata from 11 ETCs. It shows that heterogeneity exist among these Ca2+ transients, with the exhibition of both single-peaked events and accumulated-fired multiple-peaked events (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). To further analyze the timing property of Ca2+ transients in ETCs, including the duration, rise time, and decay time of Ca2+ transients in branches or somata of ETCs, we generated a MATLAB script for Ca2+ transients fitting via modeling the rise and decay phases of Ca2+ transients as linear and exponential, respectively. Through defining the threshold as 90% decay of the peak of the fitted Ca2+ transient, the duration (with ΔR/R0 above the threshold), rise time (time between the threshold and the peak in the rise phase), and decay time (time between the threshold and the peak in the decay phase) were then calculated (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). For the duration of Ca2+ transients, it shows no significant difference between the branches and somata of ETCs (branch versus soma, 40.3 ± 2.6 s versus 40.5 ± 4.9 s, p = 0.6, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test). Furthermore, there is no significant difference for the rise and decay time between the branches and somata of ETCs, respectively (rise time, branch versus soma, 16.0 ± 1.5 s versus 15.5 ± 2.3 s, p = 0.6; decay time, branch versus soma, 24.3 ± 2.0 s versus 25.0 ± 3.6 s, p = 0.2, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test). Meanwhile, the rise time is significantly shorter than the decay time of Ca2+ transients in both branches and somata of ETCs (branch, rise versus decay, 16.0 ± 1.5 s versus 24.3 ± 2.0 s, p < 0.0001; soma, rise versus decay, 15.",
    "5 ± 2.3 s versus 25.0 ± 3.6 s, p = 0.01; two-tailed Mann-Whitney test) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).",

Two ETC branches and one filopodium from the same ETC analyzed in Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] were traced. The yellow line indicates the traced path of the branches or filopodia of ETCs. Scale bar, 10 μm.\n(C) Time course of the calculated length of ETC branches and filopodia. Branch 1 (magenta) and branch 2 (blue) display retracting and extending dynamics, respectively. Meanwhile, filopodium 1 (green) shows frequent retracting and extending dynamics along with the imaging period of 120 min.",
    "Adjust the property and contrast of the mCherry time-lapse image series and export it into a Z-projected “tif” image file with the type of 8-bit.\nDuplicate one single image from the series for tracing at the analyzed time point.\nOpen the Simple Neurite Tracer plugin, and define the start (root) and end (tip) positions of the calculated ETC branch, ETC filopodium, or growing ETC.\nNote: For ETC branch, the start (root) position is the branching site between the traced branch segment and its parental branch segment, and the end (tip) position locates in the free terminal of this traced branch. While for ETC filopodium, these two positions are located in the branching site between the traced filopodium segment and its parental branch/filopodium segment, and its free terminal, respectively. For the growing path of ETC, each branch segments of the ETC should be traced, starting from the root position located in the budding site between the traced ETC and the parental vessel in CVP, and ending in positions of free terminal sites of each terminal branch. Finally, the sum of calculated length for each traced path segments is the length of growing path of the analyzed ETC.\nChoose “Keep the new path segment” and “Finish path,” then the path is traced and calculated for the length.\nSave the trace and dataset. Using this method, the retraction or extension of ETC branches and filopodia, or growing path of ETCs can be quantitatively defined or calculated.",
    "Note: The above tracing method is suitable for the morphological analysis of X-Y plane-distributed ETC branch, filopodium, or growing path. Alternatively, for the analysis of ETC morphologies with relatively wide distribution in the Z plane, the 3D tracing method should be adaptively used. For this condition, the analyzed image should be Z-axis non-projected, and the 3D Simple Neurite Tracer plugin should be used for the tracing.\nDefine morphological dynamics of ETC branches or filopodia. We define retraction or extension of ETC branches by an increase or decrease in the length above 2 μm within 60 min."
