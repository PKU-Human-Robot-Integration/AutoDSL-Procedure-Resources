  "procedures": [
    "All procedures in the following protocol were reviewed and approved by the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University.\n1. Patient preparation\nApply the following inclusion criteria: male sex; varicoceles during physical examination and on ultrasonography; infertility or abnormal semen or unrelieved pain by drugs.\nApply the following exclusion criteria: other known causes of male infertility, such as cryptorchidism, cancer, scrotum and reproductive tract surgery, hypogonadism, and azoospermia.\nPerform a testicle and spermatic cord palpation and ultrasound examination to determine the classification of varicocele. Place the patient in a standing position and confirm whether there is a dilated and clumped venous plexus on the scrotum skin.\nExamine the patient's spermatic cord to confirm whether the spermatic veins dilate during spontaneous respiration and Valsalva's movements (after deep inhalation, close the glottis tightly, then exhale forcefully to increase abdominal pressure). Perform an ultrasound examination to evaluate the diameter of the spermatic vein.\nInform the patient of the benefits and risks of surgery, including excessive bleeding and blood transfusion, testicular atrophy, recurrence, scrotal edema, hydrocele, and postoperative infection, then obtain written consent.\nCarry out the surgery under epidural anesthesia or general anesthesia with the patient placed in a supine position.\n2. Pre-HLIE preparation\nMonitor the patient's vital signs carefully by an anesthesiologist during surgery.\nSterilize the skin of the thigh, perineum, and abdomen 2x with iodophor. Create a longitudinal incision approximately 2-3 cm in length with a scalpel. Establish the incision by standard technique: 2 cm above the internal inguinal ring.\n3. High ligation and intraoperative embolization (HLIE)\nAfter incision of the subcutaneous tissue, cut the aponeurosis of the obliquus externus abdominis approximately 3 cm, and bluntly separate the muscles and transverse fascia below to expose the peritoneum and retroperitoneal adipose tissue.",
    "Use a retractor to pull the muscles and peritoneum aside to have a clear view. The spermatic cord is just behind the peritoneum, between the peritoneum and retroperitoneal adipose tissue. Use a retractor to pull the adipose tissue aside and find the spermatic cord adjacent to the peritoneum, then bluntly separate the spermatic cord from surrounding connective tissue with forceps.\nGrasp the ipsilateral scrotum by hand and pull the testicle to confirm the spermatic vein. Squeeze the testicle to promote venous drainage, which will be beneficial for intraoperative embolization with polidocanol. Cut the spermatic fascia with scissors to expose the spermatic vein, then bluntly separate the spermatic vein with forceps.\n\tNOTE: During surgical dissection of the spermatic vein, any injury to the accompanying arteries and lymphatic vessels should be avoided.\nPrepare vascular hardening agent for embolization: Use two 10 mL sterile syringes to mix 5 mL of polidocanol and 5 mL of air. Do this until a 10 mL polidocanol foam sclerosant mixture is obtained; use this for embolization.\nMake an approximately 0.2-0.3 cm longitudinal incision with a scalpel on the spermatic vein. Insert a 0.8 cm sterile syringe needle into the spermatic vein.\nInject the 10 mL polidocanol foam sclerosant mixture rapidly into the distal segment of the spermatic vein through the needle.\nRemove the needle, and double ligate the spermatic vein with 3-0 non-absorbable suture line at sites approximately 0.5 cm proximal and distal to the incision of the vein.\nFinally, check whether there is any bleeding at any point, including the spermatic cord, retroperitoneal adipose tissue, and muscles. If yes, stop the bleeding with an electrocoagulation electrotome carefully. Suture the abdominal incision with 3-0 absorbable suture material.\n4. Postoperative management",
    "Document the intra- and post-operative parameters carefully, including the diameters of the spermatic vein according to the results of ultrasound examination, operation time (from the beginning of incision to the end of suturing), and blood loss (calculated by vacuum drainage).\nPerform patient follow-up after surgery at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. Perform testicle examinations and ultrasound, pain scores (the visual analog scale (VAS) pain score to evaluate the pain of varicocele patients before and after surgery; Figure 1), semen analysis, and whether the patients had achieved impregnation or experienced scrotal edema, varicocele recurrence, or testicular atrophy.\nAsses the effect of treatment, including semen parameters and pain score, recurrence rate, and probability of complications of HLIE, and perform statistical analysis with SPSS software, taking p < 0.05 as statistically significant.\nSubscription Required.
