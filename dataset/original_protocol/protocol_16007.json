    "The first step in generating Tebucheck assay plates is to make the tebuconazole-incorporated agar at differing concentrations. Other culture media such as potato dextrose agar or malt extract agar can alternatively be used, although discrepancies in growth characteristics may be observed. Tebuconazole, 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-3-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)pentan-3-ol (CAS no. 107534-96-3), is an agricultural triazole fungicide that inhibits sterol biosynthesis (demethylation inhibitor). The primary target of tebuconazole is lanosterol 14-α-demethylase (Kelly, Lamb, Corran, Baldwin, & Kelly, 1995[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.112#cpmc112-bib-0016]), which is a key regulatory enzyme in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway in fungi. Tebuconazole is classed as moderately toxic to mammals and can be dangerous in high doses (National Center for Biotechnology Information, 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.112#cpmc112-bib-0021]); consequently, all steps handling tebuconazole should be performed with care and while wearing single-use gloves. Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.112#cpmc112-tbl-0001] provides the user with the required volumes/concentrations of tebuconazole and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for convenience. Tebuconazole stock solutions can be prepared in advance and stored in small-volume vials at −20°C for up to 1 month. To standardize the concentration of DMSO across the four wells of the assay, a supplementary volume must be added to give a final concentration of 0.032% (Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.112#cpmc112-tbl-0001]). Alternative methods for generating the tebuconazole-incorporated agar are acceptable; however, this may result in differential growth characteristics. The Tebucheck assay was developed using a 4-well multi-dish plate for standardization, reproducibility, and convenience. Other culture plates can be used, although discrepancies in growth characteristics may be observed. The stated volumes produce ∼32 4-well Tebucheck plates. Each well contains 1 ml Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) supplemented with three different concentrations of tebuconazole (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.112#cpmc112-fig-0001]). The first well is a drug-free control (0 mg/L tebuconazole), and wells 2, 3, and 4 contain SDA supplemented with 6, 8, or 16 mg/L tebuconazole, respectively.",
    "Tebucheck plates can be stored at 4°C for up to a month, although inspection of plates prior to use is recommended. The plates should be discarded if there is any obvious damage or contamination.",

    "Inoculation of Tebucheck plates includes two incubation steps: (1) the initial culturing of A. fumigatus isolates to be tested and (2) incubation of the inoculated Tebucheck plates. The user must therefore allow 72 to 120 hr to complete this protocol. This time frame includes culture and preparation of pure single colonies plus the Tebucheck incubation period. Known wild-type A. fumigatus isolates can be purchased from CBS-KNAW Collections (http://www.wi.knaw.nl/Collections/)[href=http://www.wi.knaw.nl/Collections/)] and used as a negative control. For positive controls, A. fumigatus isolates harboring the resistance alleles TR34/L98H and TR46/Y121F/T289A can be obtained by contacting the Fisher laboratory (https://www.fisherlab.co.uk[href=https://www.fisherlab.co.uk]). After incubation of Tebucheck plates, the presence or absence of growth on the surface of the four wells can be classified using the following scale: 0, no growth (0% to <10% growth coverage); 0.5, partial/visible growth (10% to <50% growth coverage); and 1, growth (50% to 100% growth coverage).\nThe end point of susceptibility should be recorded where visual growth was 0% to 10% coverage. For example, an isolate that grows vigorously in well 1, grows partially in well 2, and does not grow in wells 3 and 4 would receive a final Tebucheck score of 1.5. A population of Tebucheck A. fumigatus isolates can be analyzed together using a custom R script downloadable at https://github.com/abrackin/tebucheck[href=https://github.com/abrackin/tebucheck].\nMaterials\nSDA (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.112#cpmc112-rec-0001] or purchase from a commercial vendor; e.g., Oxoid, cat. no.

    "Validation of Tebucheck was performed using a panel of 26 environmental A. fumigatus isolates (Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.112#cpmc112-tbl-0002]) selected from the Imperial College whole genome sequencing A. fumigatus culture collection (total collection >500 isolates).
