  "title": "ELISPOT Assay to Measure Peptide-specific IFN-γ Production",
  "procedures": [
    "There are two ways to measure cell type-specific responses. Firstly, isolate total CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cells and culture with dendritic cells (DCs) and the peptide of choice (Karunarathne et al., 2016). T cells are generally enriched from experimental mice using bead based techniques such as Dynabeads magnetic beads (Untouched Mouse T cells kit; Life Technologies, US) or Miltenyi Biotec (CD90.2 T cell isolation; Germany). DCs are immuno-magnetically isolated from naive mice (for use as antigen-presenting cells; APC) using anti-mouse CD11c Microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec; Germany). DCs should not be isolated from experimental mice where DC function is known to be compromised. Both cell types (T cells and DCs) can also be isolated using flow cytometry-based cell sorting. Approximately 2 x 105 T cells, from individual mice, should be co-cultured with 2 x 104 DC, in 4-8 replicate wells per sample with 20 μg/ml peptides, recombinant protein or no peptide, as previously described (Howland et al., 2013). Alternatively, if peptides are specific for CD4+ but not CD8+ T cells and vice versa, then total spleen cell with no additional DCs or total T cells with DCs may be used. These combined cells are then cultured with the specific peptide on ELISPOT plates coated with anti-IFN-γ antibody. The IFN-γ-specific antibody on an ELISPOT plate captures the IFN-γ immediately after secretion from the cells. For human T cells, total PBMCs containing APC and T cells are cultured with the peptide of choice. For the positive control, just add PHA to total cells or isolated T cells without DCs.Day 1Coat Multiscreen HTS-IP plates with primary antibody diluted in coating buffer:Before coating the plate with antibody, humidify the membrane in each well with 15 μl of 70% ethanol (in Milli-Q water) for 1 min.",
    "Rinse with 150 μl sterile PBS three times before the ethanol evaporates. Then coat plates with 50 μl anti-IFNγ antibody (capture) in sterile coating buffer. Incubate overnight at 4 °C. Notes: Plate may be coated 1 week prior to use but must be stored in humid conditions (e.g., box with tissue drenched in sterile water or PBS).The number of wells coated with antibody should take into account the all controls listed below and at least 4-8 replicate wells for each sample.If possible, it is recommended that a titration of cell numbers (Figure 1), in replicates, be tested to ensure an optimal range of cells for counting.Ensure that sodium azide is never added to any buffer, at any step as this stops horseradish peroxidase activity.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170601/20170601202428_6389.jpgFigure 1. A representative example of an ELISPOT assay. A titration of cell numbers from negative and positive controls and 2 test samples. Test 1 shows no titration with dilution and thus and cell numbers are similar to negative control. Test 2 has declining number of cells with titration indicating IFN-γ-secreting cells.The following control wells should be incorporated into the assay:No antigen stimulation (DC and T cells cultured without peptide).Positive control with a lymphocyte mitogen (T cells without DC but with mitogen like PHA at 5-10 μg/ml).No cells; no primary antibody.Day 2Block membrane with blocking solution.Remove primary antibody solution.Wash off unbound antibody with 150 μl sterile PBS per well, at least twice. Block membrane with 150 μl per well of cell culture medium (see Recipes) for at least 2 h at 37 °C.Note: Keep changing media if it goes deep pink, until orange.Prepare mouse splenocytes (MacPherson et al., 2001; Wykes et al., 2007) or isolate T cells/DCs, suspended in cell culture medium (see Recipes). Plan for each sample to have 4-8 replicate wells.",
    "For assays using total splenocytes or PBMCs, cells are resuspended in cell culture medium, at final concentrations range of 2 x 106 to 6 x 106 cells/ml for testing at possible testing range of 1 x 105 to 3 x 105 splenocytes or PBMCs per well.Isolated T cells are usually resuspended at 4 x 106 cells/ml for testing 2 x 105 T cells cultured with 2 x 104 DC per well. Note: The desired cell concentration is dependent on the intensity of the immune response. If the expected response is not known, a serial dilution of cell concentrations is recommended. Antigens are diluted (20 μg/ml) in culture medium eventually containing recombinant IL2 (60 U/ml).Cell stimulationDiscard blocking medium.Add 50 μl of the cell suspension and 50 μl of diluted peptide (antigen) per well (final volume: 100 μl/well, corresponding to 10 μg/ml for the antigen and 30 U/ml for recombinant IL2). Note: To minimize overseeding of the wells, it is recommended to not add more than 3 x 105 cells/well.Incubate for 18 to 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity.Note: Do not move the plates while the cells are culturing. This will lead to ‘snail trail’ spots that will not be well defined. Don’t stack the plates if you have more than one to prevent edge effects.Day 3Secondary antibodyRemove culture medium with cells.Wash plate 3 times with PBS and 3 times with PBS/0.01% Tween 20.Note: Ensure you include Tween 20 in the wash buffer. Some cells will have started attaching after culture overnight. Tween 20 will help wash these off the membrane. Do not use a plate washer at this stage if available. Dilute biotinylated anti-IFNγ antibody (detection) in PBS/0.5% BSA. Pass the detection antibody mixture through a 0.45 μm or 0.22 μm filter to remove aggregates.",
    "Some of the mixture will be lost by filtration and original volume must be scaled up accordingly. Add 50 μl of detection antibody mixture to each well.Note: Failure to filter secondary antibody may results in non-specific spot formation due to protein aggregates.Incubate for 2 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity.Then incubate overnight at 4 °C, in a sealed box with tissues moistened with sterile water or PBS which provide humidity.Day 4Wash plate 6 times with PBS/0.01% Tween 20.Enzyme conjugate and substrate developmentPrepare streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase dilution in PBS.Add 50 μl per well of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. Incubate for 45 min at room temperature.Note: Exceeding 1 h incubation with enzyme conjugate could result in increased background color.Remove streptavidin solution, wash 3 times with PBS/0.01% Tween 20, followed by 3 washes with PBS.Notes:  The final washes with only PBS are important as Tween 20 will interfere with the spot development.The plastic base should be taken off the bottom of the plate to enable thorough washing of the membrane before adding substrate/chromogen. For example, after incubation with the streptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate, remove the base and wash both sides of the membrane under running distilled water. This helps to prevent high background as some reagents can leak through the membrane into the bottom tray of the plate.Add 75 μl/well AEC substrate (after passing through 0.45 μM or 0.22 μM filter). Incubate for 5 min in the dark (under aluminum foil or in a drawer) and then check for spots. If spots are not clearly visible, incubate again and check regularly. Stop spot development when spots are clearly visible but before background membrane color becomes too dark and the contrast between spot and membrane color is lost.Note: Optimization of the time of substrate development is critical. Time of development may vary.",
    "Over-development will result in increased background.Stop spot development using running tap water and wash extensively. While washing, remove the bottom of the plate and continue rinsing.Press the plate thoroughly to an absorbent tissue paper. Let plate dry overnight in the dark. Spot intensity may decrease with exposure to light.Note: Spots may become sharper if membranes are stored overnight. If storing, wrap membranes in foil."
