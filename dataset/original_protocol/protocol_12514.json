  "procedures": [
    "1. MT fractionation method\nNOTE: All experiments performed in this study were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Doshisha University. C57BL/6J mice of either sex, 3-4 months of age, were used here. In this protocol, dissected tissues, e.g., brain, liver, or thymus, were immediately homogenized in ice-cold microtubule stabilizing buffer (MSB), which contained Taxol (MT stabilizer) at a concentration that prevented not only depolymerization but also repolymerization of MT. The homogenate was separated into three fractions by a two-step ultracentrifugation process (Figure 1). All steps in this protocol were completed without interruption in a cool-temperature environment, and the tissues and fractions were not frozen until they were dissolved in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-sample buffer.\nPreparation of MSB and microtubes\n\t\nTo prepare MSB, mix the following reagents: 0.1 M 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), pH 6.8 (neutralized by KOH), 10% glycerol, 0.1 mM DTT, 1 mM MgSO4, 1 mM EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, phosphatase inhibitors (1 mM NaF, 1 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4, 0.5 µM okadaic acid), 1x protease inhibitor cocktail, and protease inhibitors (0.1 mM PMSF, 0.1 mM DIFP, 1 µg/mL pepstatin, 1 µg/mL antipain, 10 µg/mL aprotinin, 10 µg/mL leupeptin, 50 µg/mL TLCK) (see Table of Materials) and denote as MSB(-).\nJust before tissue dissection, add 10 µM Taxol and 2 mM GTP (see Table of Materials) to MSB(-). This buffer is denoted as MSB(+). Prepare the buffer on the day of use and keep it on ice.",
    "Prepare the microtubes for sampling. Empty 2.0 mL microtube for homogenate storage; empty 1.5 mL microtube for supernatant1 (S1) lysate, precipitate2 (P2) sample, and precipitate3 (P3) sample storage; 1.5 mL microtube with 1 mL of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for dissected tissue storage; 1.5 mL microtube with 200 µL of 2x SDS-sample buffer (0.16 M Tris pH 6.8; 20% glycerol; 2% 2-mercaptoethanol; 4% SDS) for S1 sample and supernatant3 (S3) sample storage; and centrifugation microtube for TLA55 and TLA120.2 centrifuge rotors (see Table of Materials). Label all tubes and place them on ice.\nMouse tissue homogenization\n\t\nPrepare a chilled table for tissue dissection. First, fill a box with crushed ice and place two Petri dishes on ice, one with the inner side up and the other with the outer side. Fill ice-cold PBS in one dish for transient wash and storage of dissected tissues. Lay filter paper moistened with PBS on another dish turned over.\nTo sacrifice a mouse, perform cervical dislocation under deep anesthesia with a mixed anesthetic of butorphanol, midazolam, and medetomidine. Then, immediately dissect the tissues, e.g., brain, liver, or thymus, and wash them with ice-cold PBS in a Petri dish.\n\t\tNOTE: Any type of soft tissue can be analyzed by this method. However, the size of the tissue is limited by the recommended volume range of the homogenizer used. For example, if a 2 mL volume of homogenizer is used, 50-100 mg of tissue is recommended.\nAfter weighing the 1.5 mL microtubes filled with PBS for dissected tissue storage, cut out and store tissues inside the microtubes, and reweigh each microtube. Each tissue's wet weight can be calculated by subtracting the weight of the tube before and after the tissue is added.",
    "Immediately homogenize the tissue in ice-cold MSB(+) with a chilled homogenizer (see Table of Materials). The volume of MSB(+) was 19 times (µL) the tissue wet weight (mg). Perform homogenization with 20 strokes until the tissue pieces disappear.\n\t\tNOTE: For example, 1,900 µL of MSB(+) is used for 100 mg of tissue. Since the volume of MSB(+) to be added must be adjusted for each wet weight of the tissue pieces analyzed, it is necessary to weigh each tissue piece accurately.\nCentrifugation of the mouse tissue homogenates\n\t\nMove the whole homogenate to a 2 mL microtube with a Pasteur pipette and centrifuge at 2,400 × g for 3 min at 2 °C to remove the debris via precipitation.\nTransfer the whole supernatant (S1 fraction) to a new 1.5 mL microtube and vortex. Then, aliquot 200 µL of S1 fraction into a centrifugation microtube and centrifuge at 100,000 × g using a TLA-55 rotor for 20 min at 2 °C to obtain the relatively large molecular weight proteins as a precipitate (P2 fraction).\n\t\tNOTE: The volume of the sample subjected to the ultracentrifugation steps affects the radius of centrifugation and the precipitation efficiency of the molecules. Keep the sample volume at 200 µL or less after this step to prevent inaccurate fractionation.\nFurther centrifuge all resultant supernatant (S2 fraction) at 500,000 × g using a TLA-120.2 rotor for 60 min at 2 °C to separate the insoluble protein complexes in the precipitate (P3 fraction) from soluble proteins in the supernatant (S3 fraction).\nAdd 400 µL of 1x SDS-sample buffer (0.08 M Tris pH 6.8; 10% glycerol; 1% 2-mercaptoethanol; 2% SDS) to the P2 and P3 fraction tubes and briefly sonicated to dissolve the precipitate. Transfer these fraction samples to an empty 1.5 mL microtube.",
    "Dissolve the total S3 fraction in 200 µL of 2x SDS-sample buffer.\nMix the remaining S1 fractions with an equal volume of 2x SDS sample buffer for use as a standard curve for Western blotting.\nBoil all these samples at 100 °C for 3 min. After the samples have cooled to room temperature, store the samples at -20 °C.\nQuantification of proteins in each fraction\n\t\nQuantify proteins in the P2, P3, and S3 fractions by Western blotting. First, use 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to separate proteins from properly diluted the P2, P3, and S3 fractions, and serially diluted S1 sample from any individual as a standard curve. Then, electroblot the samples onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (see Table of Materials).\n\t\t​NOTE: The dilution ratio of each fraction depends on the concentration of an objective protein and the reactivity of the antibody. (e.g., α-tubulin, TUBB3, β-tub, and tyrosinated tubulin in brain tissue: S3 = 1/400, P3 = 1/2,000, P2 = 1/2,000, S1 = 1/50,000, 1/20,000, 1/10,000, 1/5,000, 1/2,000; acetylated tubulin in brain tissue: S3 = 1/200, P3 = 1/400, P2 = 1/8,000, S1 = 1/100,000, 1/40,000, 1/20,000, 1/10,000, 1/4,000; α-tubulin in liver: S3 = 1/20, P3 = 1/100, P2 = 1/20, S1 = 1/50,000, 1/20,000, 1/10,000, 1/5,000, 1/2,000; α-tubulin in thymus: S3 = 1/100, P3 = 1/400, P2 = 1/20, S1 = 1/50,000, 1/20,000, 1/10,000, 1/5,000, 1/2,000 dilution of tissue concentration).\nBlock the membrane with 5% skimmed milk in Tris-buffered saline (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6; 152 mM NaCl) with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for over 30 min.\nImmerse the membrane in TBS-T containing primary antibody (see Table of Materials) for over 2 h. After that, wash the membrane with TBS-T for 3 min (3 times).",
    "Label primary antibody using HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (see Table of Materials) in TBS-T for over 1 h. After that, wash the membrane with TBS-T for 3 min (3 times).\nDevelop the membranes with Enhanced Chemiluminescence reagent. Then, analyze the bands of interest with a luminescent image analyzer (see Table of Materials).\nQuantify the protein band intensities using image analysis software (see Table of Materials) and create a standard curve by plotting the dilution units of the diluted S1 samples used for the standard curve along the X-axis and the band intensities along the Y-axis.\nRead the protein concentration (unit) corresponding to the diluted fraction samples. Multiply the concentration read with the sample dilution factor to obtain a protein unit in each fraction. Divide the measured unit of each fraction by the total protein unit (P2 + P3 + S3) to obtain a percentage.\n2. Evaluation of the properties of tubulin in each fraction\nNOTE: This biochemical method provides three groups of tubulin complexes defined by sedimentation properties. Here, the status of tubulin complexes obtained in these fractions was identified based on the size of the complex and tubulin-PTMs. Complete all steps in this protocol without interruption in a cool-temperature environment but do not freeze the fraction samples until they are dissolved in the SDS-sample buffer.\nFilter trap assay\n\t\nFilter the S2 and S3 fractions (500 µL each) using a 300 kDa ultrafiltration spin column (see Table of Materials). Perform 14,000 × g centrifugation at 2 °C until the whole supernatant is filtered, eluted proteins are collected into receiver tubes, and trapped proteins remain on the filter of reservoir tubes.\nTranslate the whole filtrates (approximately 500 µL) in receiver tubes into new 1.5 mL microtubes and dissolve them in 500 µL of 2x SDS-sample buffer.",
    "Solubilize the residues on the filter of reservoir tubes in 1,000 µL of 1x SDS-sample buffer by pipetting and transferring the samples to a new 1.5 mL microtube.\nBoil the samples at 100 °C for 3 min. After the samples have cooled to room temperature, store the samples at -20 °C.\nAnalyze the amounts of tubulin by Western blotting with DM1A (anti-α-tubulin antibody, see Table of Materials).\nSize-exclusion chromatography\n\t\nPrepare the carrier buffer (0.1 M MES, pH 6.8; 10% glycerol; 1 mM MgSO4; 1 mM EGTA; 0.1 mM DTT) supplemented with 1/10 concentration of protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described in step 1.1.1. Then, filter the solution and store it in a cold environment.\nPrepare a gel filtration chromatography column equipped with a preparative liquid chromatography system in a chromatography chamber (see Table of Materials) at 4 °C.\nBefore injecting samples onto the column, flow 180 mL of the carrier buffer to wash the column. The flow rate is 1 mL/min for 3 h.\nInject commercially available purified porcine tubulin (see Table of Materials) as a control or the S3 fraction from mouse brains (500 µL each) onto the column.\nElute at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min with carrier buffer. Collect the 1.5 mL fractions for 120 min. Monitor eluted proteins by absorbance at 280 nm. Keep the maximum pressure under 0.3 MPa.\nAfter vortexing the collected fractions, mix 50 µL of them with 50 µL of 2x SDS-sample buffer in a 1.5 mL microtube. Boil all samples at 100 °C for 3 min. After the samples have cooled to room temperature, store the samples at -20 °C.\nAnalyze the amounts of tubulin by Western blotting with DM1A, anti-α-tubulin antibody and KMX-1, anti-β-tubulin antibody (see Table of Materials).\nSubscription Required.
