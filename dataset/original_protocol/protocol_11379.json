    "All mouse experiments described here were performed according to the guidelines outlined in the institutional IACUC-approved protocols at SUNY Upstate Medical University.\n1. The Urogenital System (UGS) Dissection\nNote: The schematic is presented in Figure 1.\nEuthanize a 3-month-old male C57BL/6 mouse using the CO2 inhalational euthanasia method or another approved technique.\n\tNote: Mice between the ages of 3 and 12 months can be used successfully for the experiment. Older mice (> 6 months) will most likely have more fat around the UGS, which will need to be cleared. Identification and separation of the lobes is often difficult in mice younger than 3 months. Other strains can be used for the experiment, as well.\nPlace the mouse on its back and secure the legs using pins so that the ventral side of the animal is exposed.\nSpray 70% ethanol on the mouse’s abdomen and wipe it clean.\n\tNote: Shaving the abdomen hair before dissection is not required.\nLift the skin from the abdomen, along with the muscle layer, with a pair of medium blunt forceps and make an inverted Y-shaped incision on the abdomen using scissors.\n\t\nFirst, make a straight incision with a pair of sharp scissors from just above the penis to the sternum (Figure 2a).\nCut from the base of the incision towards each toe, up to the thighs (Figure 2b). Fold back the skin on both sides and at the bottom to view the entire abdominal area (Figure 2c-e).\n\t\tNote: The cut size varies depend on the mouse age and size. The size of the initial straight incision may range from 1.5 to 4 cm, depending on the size of the mouse.",
    "Move over the other organs to expose the UGS. Lift and move the brown-yellow intestines (Figure 2f). Pick up the abdominal fat pads (the opaque white spongy tissue) with forceps and move them to the sides (Figure 2g).\n\tNote: The UGS comprises of the seminal vesicles, urethra, prostate, ductus deferens (vas deferens), and urinary bladder. It can be identified by the characteristic pair of opaque white semicircular arches (which are the seminal vesicles), with the fluid-filled bladder sac attached to the base. The translucent tissue located right under the seminal vesicles is the prostate.\nLocate the UGS, firmly hold the urinary bladder with blunt forceps, and lift the entire UGS upwards from the mouse abdomen.\n\tNote: If the bladder is full, drain it first with a small syringe to provide a better grip with the forceps and reduce the risk of rupturing the bladder.\nContinuing to pull up on the bladder, slide a pair of scissors underneath the bladder and prostate all the way to the spine, and make a cut. Cut through any remaining connections to the abdominal cavity (Figure 2h and 2i). Be careful not to cut too close to the UGS to avoid accidental cutting through any prostate tissue.\n\tNote: While making the cut under the UGS, the scissors should be inserted all the way to the back of the mouse, so that the cut snaps the vertebral column as well. This method results in severing nearly all of the connections between the UGS and the abdominal cavity in one snip, reducing the time needed to extract the tissue from the mouse.",
    "Remove the UGS and place it in 2-6 mL (enough to cover the tissue) of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM, high glucose) in a 6 cm Petri dish (Figure 2j and 2k) and move it to a dissection microscope (10X magnification).\n\tNote: Change the dissecting media as required in the remaining steps.\n2. Dissecting the Prostate\nClear all the fat from both the dorsal and ventral sides with a pair of fine forceps and microdissection scissors (Figure 3a). Use similar surgical instruments for the rest of the dissection protocol.\n\tNote: The fat is often closely entwined with the UGS (can be identified by its white spongy appearance); hence, this step must be performed carefully to avoid accidentally snipping off any prostate tissue. It can take up to 10-15 min to clear all the fat.\nHold and pull the bladder with the forceps and snip it at the base with the scissors (Figure 3b).\nPlace the remaining tissue ventral side up. Hold one ductus deferens with forceps, trace it to the base with scissors, and snip it (Figure 3c), then repeat on the other side. Remove the ductus deferens, now leaving behind the prostate (translucent and verminous), seminal vesicles (opaque and white, semicircular), and urethra (pink-red and opaque tube) (Figure 3d and 3e).\nInsert forceps in between the inner arch of the seminal vesicles and prostate tissue anterior lobes. Pry apart the seminal vesicles and prostate and snip any connective tissue as needed (Figure 3f). Trace the seminal vesicles to their base at the urethra and remove them (Figure 3g and 3h). Be careful not to puncture them.\nProceed to dissect out the individual prostate lobes.\n3. Gross Anatomy of the Prostate and Individual Lobe Microdissection (Figures 3i-n, Figure 4)",
    "Flip the tissue with a pair of blunt forceps so that the dorsal side faces up, showing the dorsal lobes, which will resemble a butterfly’s wings.\nCollect the dorsal lobes by holding the lobe with forceps and snipping at the base with scissors (Figure 3j).\nFlip over the remaining tissue to the ventral side.\nCollect the lateral lobes, which are small and usually wrap the urethra on the side, which are wedged between the anterior, ventral, and dorsal lobes (Figure 3k).\nNext, collect the ventral lobes, which are larger than the lateral lobes and lie on the urethra ventrally (Figure 3l).\nLast, harvest the anterior lobes, the largest of the four, by cutting and discarding the urethra (Figure 3m).\nProcess the tissue pieces according to experimental needs. Proceed to section 4 for histology, or to section 5 for the spheroid culture.\n4. Lobe Identification and Morphology from Hematoxylin and Eosin-Stained Slides\nFix the prostate tissue and embed it in paraffin. Proceed with staining the slides with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to view and identify differences in prostate lobes based on histology, using the characteristics outlined by Oliveira et al.12 (Figure 5).\n5. Processing the Tissue for 3D Culture10\nNote: This is outlined in Figure 6.\nProceed with culturing the whole prostate or individual lobes as per the experimental needs. Transfer the prostate tissue to a 10 cm dish containing 2-3 mL of DMEM. With a scalpel, mince the prostate tubules as finely and evenly as possible under the dissection microscope.\nContinue with the remaining steps under a tissue culture hood, under sterile conditions.",
    "Transfer the tissue pieces along with the DMEM to a 15 mL tube and increase the volume to 9 mL with DMEM. Add 1 mL of 10x collagenase stock solution to the DMEM-tissue mixture and vortex to mix.\n\tNote: Collagenase stock solution is 10 mg/mL in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium, and the final concentration in the 15 mL tube is 1 mg/mL.\nPlace the tube on a gyratory shaker or tube rotator for 2 h at 37 °C, for the collagenase to degrade the extracellular matrix.\nCentrifuge the tube at 400 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend in 2 mL of warm 0.05% trypsin-EDTA to cleave the cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions. Transfer the tube to 37 °C for 5 min.\n\tNote: If the tissue chunks are too big to mix well, cut the pipette tip with a razor blade to make a wider bore.\nBreak up any tissue clumps by pipetting with a P1000 pipette 8-10 times, then repeating with a P200 pipette.\nNeutralize the trypsin with 3 mL of complete DMEM. Add 500 U of DNAase I and mix well.\nPass through a 5 mL syringe 5-10 times with an 18 G needle. Then pass through 5 times with a 20 G needle.\nRepeat steps 4-8 once more if the solution still contains big tissue chunks.\nFilter the cell suspension through a 40 μm filter placed on a 50 mL tube. Rinse the 15 mL tube with 5 mL of DMEM and pass through the same filter. Repeat the rinse.\nDiscard the filter and centrifuge the tube containing the flow-through at 400 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\n6. Plating and Culturing the Cells",
    "Resuspend the pellet in 0.5 mL of complete Prostate Epithelial Cell Growth Medium (PrEGM). Count the cell density using a cell counter or hemocytometer and dilute the cells to 5 x 105 cells/mL in complete PrEGM.\n\tNote: The yield from a 3-month-old mouse whole prostate can range from 3 x 105-106 cells. Hence, it is important to initially resuspend the pellet in no more than 0.5 mL of PrEGM (as mentioned above) so that the desired cell density can be achieved, even with low yield.\nMix the required volume of cells with the basement membrane ECM in a 2:3 volume ratio (60% basement membrane ECM and 40% cell suspension) and plate in a multi-well plate or chamber slide as per the experimental needs.\n\tNote: For immunostaining, plate on glass-bottom plates or chamber slides, covering the entire well or middle of the well. Plate around the rim of the well if counting the resulting organoids, or plate as several droplets all over the well if plating higher volumes. Be mindful to not spread it too thick or too thin. Plate at least 100 µL of matrix-cell mixture per 1 cm2 of plating area; for example, in a chamber slide with a 2 cm2-well surface area, 200 µL of matrix-cell mixture containing 5 x 104 cells should be plated.\nTransfer the plate/slide to a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 for 30 min for the basement membrane ECM to solidify. Then, add pre-warmed complete PrEGM to cover the well, taking care not to disturb the basement membrane ECM plug.\nRemove half of the media and add fresh media every 2-3 days. Grow spheroids for 5-10 days.\nProceed with harvesting (step 7), immunostaining (step 8), and/or imaging for downstream applications.\n7. Harvesting the Spheres",
    "To harvest spheres, aspirate the media carefully without disturbing the basement membrane ECM gel plug and add 1 mL of 1 mg/mL dispase solution in PrEGM per 100 µL of basement membrane ECM.\n\tNote: It is easier to harvest spheroids if they are plated in the middle of the well or the rim (instead of covering the whole well), to ensure that an adequate amount of the dispase solution can be added to the well.\nScrape the bottom of the plate with a cell scraper to lift off the basement membrane ECM gel into the dispase-PrEGM solution.\nPipette the entire solution up and down once with a wide bore 1000 µL pipette tip or 5 mL pipette to break up the gel plug into smaller pieces.\n\tNote: Cut the tip of a 1000 µL pipette tip with a razor blade to make a wide bore tip.\nIncubate in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 for 1-2 h until the basement membrane ECM has completely dissolved.\n\tNote: This can be ensured by visual inspection of the well bottom while tilting the plate to confirm that no more chunks of gel remain.\nCollect the cell suspension in a 15 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge spheres at 250 x g for 5 min at room temperature and continue with downstream applications.\n8. Immunostaining of the Spheres13\nNote: After spheroids have grown for the desired amount of time, the basement membrane ECM can be dissolved and spheres can be stained as described in Colicino et al.13.\nBriefly, rinse the cultures with PBS and add 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) directly to the basement membrane ECM gel plug. Incubate for 30-90 min at room temperature with slow shaking, until the basement membrane ECM is fully dissolved, replacing fresh PFA every 30 min.",
    "Note: The PFA will dissolve the gel plug and fix the spheroids during this process.\nNext, wash with PBS 3 times and add 50 mM ammonium chloride for 10 min to quench any autofluorescence from the PFA. Repeat for 3 washes with PBS.\nPermeabilize with 0.1% non-ionic detergent for 5 min and block with PBSAT (PBS, 1% BSA, 0.5% Triton X-100) for 30 min.\nIncubate with a primary antibody in PBSAT overnight at 4 °C, followed by 3 washes with PBSAT and a secondary antibody in PBSAT for 2 h at room temperature.\nRepeat the washes with PBSAT and stain with DAPI according to the manufacturer’s protocol, if desired. Wash 3 or more times with PBS.\nAdd PBS with 200 mM 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) antifade reagent and proceed to imaging.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
