    "Age-matched (for blood donation if needed) calves (weight 80–90 kg) are cared for in the animal facility. Housing and all treatment procedures are performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of Duke University Medical Center.\n1. Initiation of Anesthesia\nAfter fasting for 8–12 h, pre-medicate the calf with Telazol (4.5 mg/kg/intramuscularly) and then administer isoflurane (1–4%) via a face mask.\nPlace the cow in a supine position on a heated table and intubate. Fix the extremities to the table using heavy ties.\nPlace an intravenous catheter (14–20 gauge) in the ear vein.\nAdminister diazepam (0.22–0.44 mg/kg/intravenously) if chewing and swallowing are highly prevalent, or if the animal is biting on the endotracheal tube (ET) tube. Additionally, administer if there is difficulty with intubation to help facilitate airway exposure for intubation.\n2. Vital Signs and Central Line Settings\nStart mechanical ventilation at a tidal volume of 10–15 mL/kg and a rate of 20–25 bpm, with isoflurane (0.5–4%) maintained throughout the procedure.\nSecure the ET tube using ties to ensure no changes in tube position during the operation.\nContinuously monitor the oxygen saturation and heart rates throughout the experiment. Address any difficulties with ventilation or oxygen saturation (SaO2) immediately. These will likely be related to either tube position, or ventilator settings. If it is tube position, adjust the ET tube to achieve adequate tidal volumes.\n3. Central Vascular Access\nAlthough the following may be done percutaneously using ultrasound guidance, use a cut down approach to better control any local bleeding once the animal is anticoagulated.\nUsing the trachea as a landmark, shave the neck fur (with hair clippers), and sterilize the area using betadine. Make a parallel linear incision 1–2 cm away from the trachea and 20 cm from the manubrium using a no.10 blade scalpel.",
    "Divide the sternocleidomastoid, and carefully expose the left common carotid artery and internal jugular vein using an electric cautery tool. Use a self-retaining retractor to help with the exposure. Maintain proximal and distal control of both the artery and the vein with large silk sutures (size 0 or 1 silk) or vessel loops.\nCannulate the left common carotid artery with an 18-gauge catheter for blood pressure monitoring. De-air the line, and if bleeding is encountered, place a 6-0 or 7-0 polypropylene suture in a purse-string fashion around the catheter.\n\t\nAttach the pressure transducer to the console and transduce the pressure wave into the software under \"systemic pressure\". Read and record the output.\nAccess the left internal jugular vein for both fluid and drug administration and central venous pressure monitoring. Attach the pressure transducer to the console and transduce the pressure wave into the software under \"central venous pressure\". Read and record the output.\nSecure both lines distally to the skin and monitor. Record baseline central venous pressure (CVP) and arterial blood pressure.\n4. Median Sternotomy and Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB)\nPalpate the sternum from the manubrium to the xiphoid to choose a spot in the midline and mark using a sterile surgical marker. Shave the fur with a hair clipper, and sterilize the area using betadine. Apply a sterile surgical drape.\nMake an incision using a no.10 blade from the manubrium down to the xiphoid.\nUse an electric cautery tool to divide the pectoralis major down from the sternum, while being perfectly aligned to the midline using manual palpation of the lateral edges of the sternum. Score the midline of the sternum using the electric cautery tool. Begin the sternotomy from the bottom by dividing the xiphoid with heavy scissors.",
    "Extend the sternotomy cephalad with garden clippers. After each cut, inspect the sternum. Perform digital palpation underneath the sternum, and perform blunt dissection to help the heart and lung fall away from the sternum. Midway through the sternotomy some crossing transversalis muscle may be encountered and these are divided using electric cautery.\nComplete the sternotomy all the way to the manubrium. Take care to stay along the midline as this will be important for healing.\nAfter the sternotomy is completed, achieve hemostasis by scoring the bleeding muscle edges with the electric cautery tool. Apply bone wax to the marrow of the sternum to help with any residual bleeding.\nIdentify the thymus and remove it using the electric cautery tool. Enter the pericardium in a longitudinal fashion, and reflect from the diaphragm up to the aorta.\n\t\nCreate a pericardial cradle using five 2-0 silk sutures approximating the pericardium to the skin to pull the heart up and support it. Choose all the corners of the opened pericardium and bring them directly anterior to the skin using the silk sutures.\nCreate a 3-inch-long window between the aorta and pulmonary artery by dissecting the connective tissue to allow for the passing of the aortic cross clamp. Apply a purse-string 4-0 polypropylene suture to the ascending aorta at a location proximal to the bifurcation.\nCircumferentially free the superior vena cava (SVC) using blunt dissection, and apply a second purse string 3-0 polypropylene suture. Establish systemic heparinization using an initial dose of 300 U/kg to achieve an activated clotting time (ACT) greater than 400 s.",
    "Once the appropriate ACT is achieved, use a no.11 blade to enter the aorta, and insert an 18 Fr arterial cannula. De-air the cannula and attach to the arterial line of CPB. Next, place a 28 Fr SVC cannula in the SVC, and start a CPB.\nWhile on partial CPB, identify the inferior vena cava (IVC) and cannulate as described for the SVC. Do so while on bypass since it allows for better hemodynamic management given the need to push on the heart for the exposure.\n\tNOTE: There may still be a potential for the development of hypotension since CPB is only on as partial support at this point. If hypotension is experienced, this step should be done carefully and broken up to allow the animal's heart to fill intermittently.\nOnce the IVC cannula is securely inserted, splice into the main circuit using a Y connector. Loop both the SVC and IVC with umbilical tape to allow for complete blood isolation from the heart.\n5. Ventriculectomy\nWhile on full cardiopulmonary support, snare down the SVC and IVC using the previously applied umbilical tape. Apply an aortic cross clamp proximal to the aortic cannulation site. Once the clamp position has been confirmed, start the ventriculectomy.\nExcise the ventricular tissue circumferentially 1-2 cm distal to the right and left atrioventricular groove. Leave the rim of ventricular muscle with the mitral and tricuspid annuli to provide further support for the implantation of the swing rings.\nTransect the sub-valvular apparati for the mitral and tricuspid valves as they are encountered.\nExcise the right ventricle outflow tract muscle with the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) including the excision of the pulmonary valve. Also, excise the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT), but preserve the posterior aspect of the aortic valve as part of the aorto-mitral curtain.",
    "Divide the interventricular septum last. Identify the orifice of the coronary sinus and ligate with 5-0 polypropylene sutures.\n6. Implantation of Centrifugal Flow Pumps (CFP)\nUse pledgeted, interrupted, 2-0 braided sutures to secure the sewing ring to the ventricular tissue and mitral valve annulus. Exit the sutures on the epicardial surface of the ventricular muscle rim and bring through the sewing ring. This technique avoids \"bunching up\" of the tissue above the ring which would interfere with the coaptation of the ring with the pump.\nUse a similar approach to attach the sewing ring to the right ventricle muscle rim and tricuspid annulus.\nAttach the CFPs to the sewing rings and secure with the standard locking mechanism. Orient these to allow access to the locking mechanism.\nAdjust the outflow graft length according to the orientation of choice. Once a proper length has been identified, cut the outflow graft. Take care to not make the graft too long as that may cause kinking.\nUse running 4-0 polypropylene sutures to anastomose the outflow grafts to the aorta (for the left heart CFP) and pulmonary artery (for the right heart CFP) in an end to end fashion.\nPrior to completing the anastomoses, release the tape on the SVC and IVC drainage cannulas and allow blood to fill the right and left pump, thus beginning the de-airing process. Place an 18-gauge needle into each of the outflow grafts for further de-airing. Use the ventilator to provide large volume breaths to allow for any air trapped in the pulmonary veins to be returned and de-aired.\n\t\nAfter de-airing is complete, remove the needle, and repair the site using pledgeted 5-0 polypropylene sutures.",
    "Start the pumps at a low rpm speed (3,000 rpm) to allow for forward blood flow, initially with the clamp still in place. Remove the aortic cross clamp and leave some blood volume to enter the pumps.\nGradually increase the pump speed as the cardiopulmonary support is weaned. Terminate the CPB and support the circulation entirely by the right and left side pumps.\nDetermine the final pump speed settings by the venous filling pressures on the right and left side.\nIntroduce pressure catheters directly into the pulmonary artery and the pulmonary veins using a purse-string 5-0 polypropylene suture to secure them in place.\nTransduce pressure signals to the software under the labels \"pulmonary artery\" and \"pulmonary vein\". In addition, place ultrasonic flow probes around the ascending aorta and the main pulmonary artery.\n\tNOTE: All 4 channels should now be active: 1. \"systemic pressure\", 2. \"central venous pressure\", 3. \"pulmonary artery\" and 4. \"pulmonary vein\".\n7. Establishment of Biventricular Assist Device Flow\nWhile gradually decreasing the CPB flow, slowly increase the left CFP and then the right CFP speed while always maintaining a lower right CFP speed than the left CFP.\nPay careful attention to the hemodynamics, including the systemic blood pressure and CVP. Pulmonary overcirculation is indicated by non-physiological pressures in the pulmonary artery or pulmonary vein.\nEventually, increase the left CFP and right CFP speeds to achieve a flow of 4 L/min on each device and wean off the CPB. Once hemodynamic stability is achieved, remove the SVC and IVC cannulas and tie down the purse-string sutures.\nNext, remove the aortic cannula and tie down the purse-string suture. Euthanize the animal by slowly turning down, and then stopping both the CFP pumps while the animal is under anesthesia.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
