    "Lipid II reactions for HPLC assayNote: A control reaction, containing the peptidoglycan synthase PBP1B and its cognate activator LpoB, is assayed to polymerize lipid II into short glycan chains with C55-PP at the terminal MurNAc residue. Dry 10,000 dpm (~1 nmol) of [14C]GlcNAc-labeled lipid II-Lys, stored in chloroform/methanol (1:1), in a glass vial using a vacuum.Resuspend the lipid II in 5 μl of 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100 and vortex for 10 sec at 1,800 rpm.Prepare in a 1.5 ml microtube a reaction buffer mixture with final concentrations of 15 mM HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 0.023% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 0.4 mM CaCl2 (the PBP1B-LpoB control reaction did not contain CaCl2) in a total reaction volume of 100 μl.Note: Take into account the constituents present in the storage buffer of the assayed proteins to calculate the buffer mixture.Add 2 μM phosphatase (e.g., TelCt or Colicin M) or phosphatase-inhibitor complex (TelCt-TipC) to the reaction buffer. For a control sample add 0.75 μM PBP1B and 1.5 μM LpoB to the reaction buffer.Add the reaction mixture to the resuspended lipid II and incubate it for 60 min in a microtube shaking incubator at 37 °C with shaking (800 rpm).Spin down the condensation using a microcentrifuge.Reactions with phosphatases (TelCt, TelCt-TipC or Colicin M) are processed as follows:Adjust the pH of the sample to 3.5-4.0 using 20% phosphoric acid and pH indicator stripes. Note: Measure the pH by putting 0.3 μl sample onto the pH indicator stripe.Centrifuge the sample in a microcentrifuge for 15 min at maximum speed and room temperature. Transfer the supernatant into an HPLC vial containing a 400 µl vial insert.The control reaction with PBP1B-LpoB requires additional steps to digest the peptidoglycan with a muramidase and reduce the resulting unphosphorylated muropeptides.",
    "After Step A6 the reaction must be processed as follows:Incubate samples for 5 min at 100 °C using a dry bath, then spin down the condensation using a microcentrifuge.Let the samples cool down at room temperature for 2 min.Add 30 μl of cellosyl buffer (80 mM sodium phosphate, pH 4.8) and 10 µl of 0.5 µg µl-1 cellosyl (or mutanolysin) to the sample.Incubate the samples for 70 min in a microtube shaking incubator at 37 °C with shaking (800 rpm).Spin down the condensation using a microcentrifuge.Boil the reaction for 10 min at 100 °C on a dry bath and centrifuge the sample using a microcentrifuge for 15 min at maximum speed and room temperature.Punch a hole in the lid of a new 2 ml microcentrifuge tube using a needle.Note: The hole will allow releasing the H2 gas produced during the reduction step.Transfer the supernatant to the 2 ml microcentrifuge tube.Reduce the muropeptides by adding 100 μl of 0.5 M sodium borate, pH 9.0 and a tip of a spatula of solid sodium borohydride (ca. 1 mg).Incubate the sample for 30 min at room temperature in a microcentrifuge at 4,700 x g to prevent spillage due to gas bubbles.Adjust the pH of the sample to 3.5-4.0 using 20% phosphoric acid and pH indicator stripes.Note: Measure the pH by putting 0.3 μl of sample onto the pH indicator stripe.Centrifuge the sample in a microcentrifuge for 15 min at maximum speed and room temperature. Transfer the supernatant into an HPLC vial containing a 400 µl vial insert.Detection of lipid II products by HPLCSystem and set up conditions:HPLC connected to a radioactivity flow-through detectorC18 reversed-phase columnFlow rate: 0.5 ml min-1Column temperature: 55 °CWash with 100% methanol for 20 min at room temperature.Increase column temperature to 55 °C.",
    "Start a linear gradient for 30 min from 100% methanol to 100% Milli Q water, holding 100% Milli Q water for further 20 min.Wash with HPLC buffer B for 20 min and equilibrate the column with HPLC buffer A for 40 min.Do a buffer run following the same method used for the samples of interest (Steps B6-B9) but without injecting any sample.Inject the sample (leave 20 µl of the total reaction volume in the vial insert) and flush the injection loop with HPLC buffer A for 2 min.Start a linear elution gradient for 60 min from 100% HPLC buffer A to 50% HPLC buffer B, holding 50% HPLC buffer B for further 10 min.Re-equilibrate the column with 100% HPLC buffer A for 30 min.Inject the next sample.Representative HPLC chromatograms of each sample are shown in Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180313/20180313191028_2915.jpgFigure 2.
