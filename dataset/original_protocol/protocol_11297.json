    "1. Library preparation and sequencing\nGeneral assay considerations and pre-assay steps\nAssay runs typically consist of seven clinical samples and one positive control (although the number of samples per library preparation run can be adjusted as necessary). Use a positive control that contains at least several gene fusions (that the assay targets) that have been confirmed by a manufacturer and/or have been confirmed by an orthogonal methodology. A non-template control (NTC) must be included as an additional sample in every assay run, but is only carried through second strand cDNA synthesis and pre-sequencing quality control (Pre-Seq QC; to ensure no cDNA synthesis). Use sample diluent (10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0) for the NTC.\nPerform total nucleic acid (TNA) extraction of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue.\nQuantify the RNA component of the TNA using a fluorometric assay.\n\t\tNOTE: Prevent RNA degradation in the samples by limiting freeze-thaw cycles, keeping thawed nucleic acid at low temperature (chilled block, ice, or alternative), and preventing RNase contamination (wearing gloves, using an RNase decontaminator spray).\nRandom priming\n\tNOTE: The desired input for the assay is 200 ng RNA (based on fluorometric quantitation of the TNA). Lower inputs can be used if 200 ng cannot be achieved. If the sample fails post-sequencing QC, repeating with higher input may result in acceptable QC metrics.\n\t\nDilute TNA in 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 to achieve desired RNA concentration. For each sample, transfer 20 µL of the dilution into the random priming reagent strip tubes (placed in pre-chilled aluminum block) and mix by pipetting up and down 6−8 times. Briefly spin down and transfer the entire volume to a 96 well PCR plate and seal with RT film.",
    "Insert plate in thermocycler block, cover with compression pad, and close lid. Incubate at 65 °C for 5 min (heated lid).\nRemove plate from thermocycler and place on ice for 2 min.\nFirst strand cDNA synthesis\nTransfer the entire volume of the random priming product into the first strand reagent strip tubes (placed in pre-chilled aluminum block). Mix by pipetting up and down 6−8 times. Briefly spin down, transfer entire volume to a 96 well PCR plate and seal with RT film.\nInsert plate in thermocycler block, cover with compression pad, and close lid. Run thermocycler program: 25 °C 10 min, 42 °C 30 min, 80 °C 20 min, 4 °C hold (heated lid).\nSecond strand cDNA synthesis\nIn a new set of PCR strip tubes, create a 1:10 dilution of the first strand product by adding 1 µL of first strand product to 9 µL nuclease free water. Set the dilution aside to be used in the Pre-Seq QC assay.\nAdd 21 µL of nuclease free water to the remaining first strand product. Transfer 40 µL of the first strand product and nuclease free water to the second strand reagent strip tube (placed in pre-chilled aluminum block). Mix by pipetting up and down 6−8 times. Spin down, transfer entire volume to a 96 well PCR plate and seal with RT film.\nInsert plate in thermocycler block, cover with compression pad, and close lid. Run thermocycler program: 16 °C 60 min, 75 °C 20 min, 4 °C hold (heated lid).\n\t\tNOTE: This is an acceptable stopping point. The plate can be stored at -20 °C.\nPre-Seq QC",
    "NOTE: This quality control (QC) assay is used primarily for verification of no cDNA synthesis from the NTC. However, the data may also be informative in assay troubleshooting. For example, if a sample has a good Pre-Seq QC value but poor assay metrics (see below) then it might be an indication of a problem in the assay run, necessitating a repeat.\n\t\nRun each sample and the NTC in duplicate. Also include in the Pre-Seq QC run a reaction NTC, which is nuclease free water (also run in duplicate). To each applicable well of an optical 96 well plate add 5 µL of the assay master mix, 1 µL of 10x VCP primer, and 4 µL of the 1:10 dilution of the first strand product that was created in step 1.4.1.\nSeal the plate with RT film, spin down, and load into a quantitative PCR (qPCR) instrument. Run the program: pre-amp: 1 cycle 95 °C 20 s, amp: 35 cycles 95 °C 3 s (4.4 °C/s ramp rate) − 60 °C 30 s (2.2 °C/s ramp rate).\nConfirm lack of a cycle threshold (Ct) value for both the assay NTC and reaction NTC.",
    "NOTE: If there is no Ct observed in the assay NTC it will no longer be carried forward in the assay. Observation of a Ct value in the reaction NTC necessitates a repeat of the Pre-Seq QC assay. Observation of a Ct in the assay NTC suggests sample contamination at some point prior in the assay, thus requiring that the entire assay (all samples) be started over. The Pre-Seq QC Ct value for an adequate quality sample should be below 30 (lower Ct values correlate with more product and thus higher quality RNA). Values above 30 are not absolute indicators of failure and these sample should be continued in the assay. However, all data derived from such samples should be reviewed carefully, particularly in cases for which no fusion is called.\nEnd repair and bead purification\nTransfer 40 µL of the second strand product into the end repair reagent strip tube (placed in pre-chilled aluminum block). Mix by pipetting up and down 6−8 times, spin down and place into thermocycler block (keeping the heated lid open) and run the thermocycler program: 25 °C 30 min, 4 °C hold.\nRemove purification beads from 4 °C and allow to equilibrate to room temperature. Make up enough 70% ethanol to last throughout the entire library preparation. Vortex beads well before use and pipet 100 µL into the appropriate number of wells of a U-bottom plate.\n\t\tNOTE: For every 8 samples that are run, 20 mL of 70% ethanol will be needed.\nAdd entire volume of the end repair product to the beads. Pipet up and down 6−8 times to mix and incubate at room temperature for 5 min, followed by a 5-min incubation on the magnet.",
    "Remove and discard the supernatant and perform two 200 µL 70% ethanol washes with 30-s incubations. After the final wash remove all 70% ethanol and let air dry for 5 min.\nRemove from magnet and re-suspend beads in 22 µL of 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0. Incubate off the magnet for 3 min followed by a 2-min incubation on the magnet. Proceed immediately to ligation step 1.\nLigation step 1 and bead purification\nTransfer 20 µL from the end repair bead purification plate (taking care not to disturb bead pellet) into the ligation step 1 strip tubes (placed in pre-chilled aluminum block). Mix by pipetting up and down 6−8 times, spin down and transfer the entire volume into a 96 well PCR plate.\nInsert plate in thermocycler block, cover with compression pad and close lid. Run thermocycler program: 37 °C 15 min, 4 °C hold (heated lid).\nRemove purification beads from 4 °C and allow to equilibrate to room temperature. Vortex beads well before use and pipet 50 µL into the appropriate number of wells of a U-bottom plate.\nAdd entire volume of ligation step 1 product to the beads. Pipet up and down 6−8 times to mix and incubate at room temperature for 5 min, followed by a 5-min incubation on the magnet.\nRemove and discard the supernatant and perform two 200 µL 70% ethanol washes with 30-s incubations. After the final wash remove all 70% ethanol and let air dry for 5 min.\nRemove from magnet and re-suspend beads in 42 µL of 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0. Incubate off the magnet for 3 min followed by a 2-min incubation on the magnet. Proceed immediately to ligation step 2.\nLigation step 2 and bead purification",
    "Remove molecular barcode (MBC) adapter strip tube reagents from 4 °C storage. Proper numbering of the MBC adapter strip is critically important as sample-specific indexes are added at this point. Position the tubes horizontally with the hinges to the back and use a permanent marker to label the tubes 1, 2, 3… from left to right. It is also critical to record the sample-specific indexes for sequencing purposes (they must be entered in the sequencer worksheet).\nTransfer 40 µL from the ligation step 1 bead purification plate (taking care not to disturb bead pellet) to the MBC adapter strip tubes (placed in pre-chilled aluminum block). Mix by pipetting up and down 6−8 times.\nSpin down and transfer the entire volume to the ligation step 2 reagent strip tubes (also placed in pre-chilled aluminum block). Mix by pipetting up and down 6−8 times, spin down and place in thermocycler block. With the heated lid off run the thermocycler program: 22 °C 5 min, 4 °C hold.\n\t\tNOTE: This is a safe stopping point and samples can be stored at -20 °C.\nRemove ligation cleanup beads from 4 °C storage and allow to equilibrate to room temperature. Prepare 1 mL of fresh 5 mM NaOH.\nVortex the ligation cleanup beads and add 50 µL to a new set of PCR strip tubes. Incubate on the magnet for 1 min. After the 1-min incubation remove and discard supernatant. Remove strip tubes from magnet and re-suspend in 50 µL of ligation cleanup buffer by pipetting up and down 6−8 times.",
    "Transfer entire volume of the ligation step 2 product into the ligation cleanup bead strip tubes. Mix the samples by vortexing and incubate at room temperature for 5 min. Again, mix samples by vortexing and incubate at room temperature for another 5 min. After the second 5-min incubation, mix the samples by vortexing, spin down briefly and incubate on the magnet for 1 min.\nRemove and discard supernatant. Add 200 µL of ligation cleanup buffer and vortex to re-suspend. Perform a quick spin and place on the magnet for 1 min. Perform a second wash using the ligation cleanup buffer again.\nAfter the two washes with the ligation cleanup buffer perform an identical wash using ultrapure water. Following the ultrapure water wash re-suspend the beads in 20 µL of 5 mM NaOH and transfer to a 96 well PCR plate. Place the plate into thermocycler block with a compression pad and run the thermocycler program: 75 °C 10 min, 4 °C hold (heated lid).\nSpin down the PCR plate once the samples have cooled to 4 °C. Place the plate on magnet for at least 3 min and proceed immediately to first PCR.\nFirst PCR and bead purification\nRemove the first PCR reagent strip tubes from 4 °C Storage and place in a pre-chilled aluminum block. Also, remove the GSP1 primers from -20 °C and allow to equilibrate to room temperature.\nAdd 2 µL of the GSP1 primers to each well of the first PCR reagent strip tubes.

Vortex beads well before use and pipet 24 µL into the appropriate number of wells of a U-bottom plate.\nTransfer 20 µL of the first PCR product to the 24 µL of beads. Pipet up and down 6−8 times to mix and incubate at room temperature for 5 min, followed by a 2-min incubation on the magnet.\nRemove and discard the supernatant and perform two 200 µL 70% ethanol washes with 30-s incubations. After the final wash remove all 70% ethanol and let air dry for 2 min.\nRemove from magnet and re-suspend the beads in 24 µL of 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0. Incubate off the magnet for 3 min followed by a 2-min incubation on the magnet. Proceed immediately to second PCR.\nSecond PCR and bead purification\nRemove the Second PCR reagent strip tubes from 4 °C and place in a pre-chilled aluminum block. Proper numbering of the second PCR strip tubes is critically important as sample-specific indexes are added at this point. Position the tubes horizontally with the hinges to the back and use a permanent marker to label the tubes 1, 2, 3… from left to right. Also, remove the GSP2 primers from -20 °C and allow to equilibrate to room temperature.",
    "NOTE: It is also critical to record the sample-specific indexes for sequencing purposes (they must be entered in the sequencer worksheet).\nAdd 2 µL of the GSP2 primers to each well of the second PCR reagent strip tubes. Transfer 18 µL of the first PCR cleanup product to the second PCR reagent strip tubes and mix by pipetting up and down 6−8 times.\nSpin down and transfer to a 96 well PCR plate.

    "NOTE: This is a safe stopping point and libraries can be stored at -20 °C for long term storage or proceed immediately to library quantification.\nLibrary quantitation\nRemove the library quantitation master mix and standards from -20 °C storage and allow to equilibrate to room temperature.\nPerform 1:5 dilution of all libraries (second PCR product) using 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 followed by a serial dilution of 1:199, 1:199, and 20:80 using 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 0.05% polysorbate. The final two dilutions of 1:200,000 and 1:1,000,000 respectively will be run in triplicate.\nAdd 6 µL of master mix to each well of an optical 96 well plate followed by 4 µL of appropriate dilution or standard. Spin down the plate and load it onto the qPCR instrument. Use the following cycling conditions: 1 cycle 95 °C 5 min, 35 cycles 95 °C 30 s (4.4 °C/s ramp rate) − 60 °C 45 s (2.2 °C/s ramp rate).\nAfter library quantification is complete and library concentrations are determined (through averaging both tested dilutions), normalize all libraries to 2 nM using 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0. Make the library pool by combining 10 µL of each normalized library into one 1.5 mL micro centrifuge tube.\nSequencing of libraries \nRemove sequencer reagent cartridge from -20 °C storage and place in deionized (DI) water up to the fill line for at least 1 h. Also, remove sequencer reagent kit from 4 °C and allow to equilibrate to room temperature for at least 1 h. The maximum number of libraries that can be sequenced on this sequencing platform is 8 (one of which must be the positive control).",
    "Make the denatured amplicon library (DAL) pool by combining 10 µL of the library pool with 10 µL of 0.2 N NaOH and incubate for 5 min at room temperature. After the 5-min incubation add 10 µL of 200 mM Tris HCl pH 7.0, followed by 970 µL of HT1 hybridization buffer.\nMake the final load tube by combining 300 µL of HT1, 25 µL of 20 pM PhiX and 675 µL of the DAL pool.

Add entire volume of the load tube to the sample well of the sequencer reagent cartridge and load cartridge into the sequencer running 2 x 151 bp reads with 2 x 8 index reads.\n2. Data analysis\nSequencing data handling and analysis\nDownload sequencing metrics from the NGS instrument.\nEnsure that sequencing data falls into the below ranges (specific for the kit used in this example). Cluster density (density [K/mm2]): 945–1600 K; % of reads passing filter (clusters PF [%]): >90%; quality scores (% ≥Q30): >85%; PhiX alignment (aligned %): 1.5−6.0%; PhiX error rate (error rate [%]): <1.0%; reads passing filter (reads PF [M]): >22 million.\n\t\tNOTE: Sequencing runs not meeting these metrics are subject to repeat.\nReview the % of reads attributed to each sample (i.e., each sample-specific index). For a typical run in which the PhiX spike-in was ~5% and 8 samples were sequenced, each sample should ideally account for approximately 11.9% of the reads. The acceptable range for each sample is 5−25%. If any samples do not fit within this range, repeat library quantitation and sequencing.\nSubmission of raw sequence data to the analysis algorithm",
    "NOTE: Version 4.1.1.7 of ArcherDx Analysis is described here. In this example, the analysis software is deployed as a ‘virtual machine’ run on an internal server. One central processing unit (CPU) and 12 GB of random access memory (RAM) are required for each sample to be analyzed concurrently (typically 8 samples are processed concurrently requiring 8 CPU and 96 GB RAM). Processing typically takes 3−8 h.\n\t\nUse default analysis settings within the analysis system, with the exception of MIN_AVERAGE_UNIQUE_RNA_START_SITES_PER_GSP2_CONTROLS (this is changed from 10 to 20) and READ_DEPTH_NORMALIZATION (this is set to 0 to prevent down-sampling).\nTo start an analysis job, click on Perform Analysis in the user interface, submit a name for the job, and then select the necessary FASTQ files (ensuring that both reads [R1 and R2] are selected for each sample).\nSelect RNA Fusion for RNA analysis types, Illumina (paired) for platform, and FusionPlex Solid Tumor Panel for target region. Then click on Submit Analysis.\nAssay data interpretation\nOpen the user interface of the analysis system and select the desired job. Select the positive control sample. Ensure that all expected fusions and oncogenic isoforms have been detected and are listed in the Strong Evidence tab.\n\t\tNOTE: If any of the tracked fusions in the positive control are not detected for a given run of the assay, it may be an indication of a problem in that run, which necessitates a repeat (from beginning of the assay).\nExamine the read statistics for each clinical sample in the run by clicking on the Read Statistics tab. Each sample should be represented by at least 1 million total fragments. If less than 1 million, re-sequence the library with considerations for re-quantitation to ensure the initial quantitation was not aberrantly high.",
    "NOTE: Good quality samples will generally display On Target % >85%, and the RNA Molecular Bins should be >20,000 and comprise >30% of the reads. However, failure to meet these metrics does not automatically trigger sample failure.\nInspect the Average Unique Start Sites per GSP2 Control value.\n\t\tNOTE: This value is a measure of sequencing complexity from primers to four housekeeping genes. This metric is a critical determinant of RNA quality in the sample (if sequencing of genes expected to be expressed in the sample is poor, then confidence in the ability to detect an expressed gene fusion is low). The cutoff for this metric is 20. If any sample displays a value less than 20, then results for the sample must be reported as uninformative if no high confidence fusion is found. The status of this metric can also be determined in the summary page of the run (status will be listed as Fusion QC: Pass or Fusion QC: Number of Unique RNA GSP2 Control Start Sites Low depending on whether the value is greater than or less than 20). A high confidence fusion in a sample that did not pass this QC metric can still be reported if it is determined to be real (see below). Generally, higher QC scores using this metric correlate with lower PreSeq Ct scores, as expected (Figure 2).\nFusion call interpretation\nCarefully scrutinize every called fusion under the Strong Evidence tab (the majority of strong evidence fusions called by the system are artifactual). Also scan the weak evidence fusion bin, although the presence of a non-artifactual fusion in this bin is an extremely rare event. To assess validity of a fusion, first note the Reads (#/%) and Start Sites metrics.",
    "NOTE: Generally, confidence in a called fusion increases the higher these metrics are. Fusions that are supported by less than 5 start sites and by less than 10% of the reads from the supporting primer should be considered as highly suspicious as being artifactual.\nMake note of the icons displayed in the Filters column.\n\t\tNOTE: Several of these icons alert the user of a potential source of an artifactual call. Frequent among these (and primarily found in the weak evidence bin of called fusions) are instances where the partners are known paralogs or show similarity to each other in sequence (indicating likely mis-priming or erroneous alignment). Another common source of artifactual fusion calls occurs when the reads supporting the fusion contain a high error rate that is indicative of poor mapping to the reference genome, and this is associated with a distinct icon. Transcriptional readthrough events are identified via another icon. These are common and are generally ignored. Several other icons are also used in the user interface, but a full description of all is beyond the scope of this article. Common artifacts that can generally be ignored without further investigation include: ADCK4-NUMBL, SYN2-PPARG, DGKG-ETV5, ETV6-AXL, ETV1-ERG, ETV4-ETV1, FGFR3-PDGFRB, EGFR-NTRK1, RAF1-RET, ALK-TFEB, NOTCH1-RET, RELA-RET, NTRK3-ALK, BRAF-ADAMTS8, and FCGR2C-MAST.",
    "Visualize the supporting reads for each potential fusion by clicking on the Visualize link in the user interface, which takes the user to a web-based JBrowse view of pileups of individual fusion-supporting reads. Confirm that the reads are generally free of mismatch (although some noise is to be expected), that a significant proportion (ideally >30 bases) of the reads align to the fusion partner, and that sequences immediately adjacent to the breakpoint between the genes and the primer binding sites are free of insertions or deletions. Confirm that aligned sequence includes the 3’ portion of the primer binding sequences for primers that support the fusion reads (if 3’ portions are not included, it can be an indication of mis-priming).\nIf coding sequences of both genes are involved in the fusion, ensure that the 3’ partner remains in-frame. Click on the Translation link in the interface (which will give a True or False status for each reference sequence combination) and also manually confirm that the fusion is in frame through inspection of the called breakpoints in a genome browser. The called breakpoints can be determined by hovering the mouse over the red dots in the fusion schematic.\n\t\tNOTE: Since most (but not all) genomic breakpoints for legitimate fusions occur in intronic regions and result in splicing together of whole exons, fusions in which exon boundaries comprise the breakpoints for both partners are generally viewed with a higher degree of confidence. However, since there are many published examples of mid-exonic breakpoints in fusions, this should not be used as absolute criteria in the interpretation of a fusion.\nFor each fusion, manually ensure that sequences adjacent to the breakpoint are not homologous to the next expected contiguous bases for each partner. Inspect all possible contiguous exons in a genome browser.",
    "NOTE: A common source of artifactual fusion is misalignment or mis-priming due to homology between two gene partners, and this is not always called by the system via the icons described above.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
