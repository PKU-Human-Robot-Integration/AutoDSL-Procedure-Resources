    "The respiratory oscillometry studies were approved by the University Health Network Research Ethics Board (REB# 17-5373, 17-5652 and 19-5582). Written informed consent was obtained from participants prior to oscillometry test.\nNOTE: This video outlines the standard operating procedure for oscillometry. Our laboratory uses a device manufactured by Thorasys Thoracic Medical Systems Inc but the technique is the same regardless of the manufacturer. The software programs are different for each manufacturer, in the same way that different commercial spirometers have unique proprietary software for data collection and display. The protocol below is applicable for all respiratory oscillometry devices. Readers are directed to manuals of their commercial devices and refer to specific instructions regarding software of their device.\n1. Pre-test patient screening/preparation\nEnsure that the patient is free of any active or suspected transmissible respiratory infection, such as coronavirus or tuberculosis.\nEnsure that the patient has not had any recent dental or facial surgeries, such as tooth extractions, and can form a proper tight seal around the mouthpiece.\nEnsure that the patient is as relaxed as possible, is not wearing tight-fitted clothing, and withholds from tobacco use and vigorous exercise at least 1 h prior to testing.\nPerform oscillometry prior to conventional PFTs, such as spirometry, if requested by a referring physician.\n\tNOTE: Refer to Supplemental Table 1 for contraindications for spirometry/PFTs.\nEnsure that the patient withholds bronchodilators prior to testing, unless instructed by a referring physician to continue bronchodilator medication.\n\tNOTE: Refer to Supplemental Table 2 for bronchodilator withholding times for PFTs and Supplemental Table 3 for bronchodilator withholding times for the methacholine challenge test.\n2. Equipment/materials preparation\nEquipment preparation\n\t\nVerify the resistance load of the oscillometry device by using a valid factory calibrated mechanical test load prior to patient testing.",
    "Remove the dust caps at both ends of the mechanical test load and attach onto the oscillometry device.\nSelect calibration from the oscillometry software menu and proceed with impedance test load verification.\n\t\tNOTE: The recommended tolerance for the verification is ≤ ±10% or ±0.1 cmH2O·s/L, whichever is met first.\nUpon successful verification, save and proceed with testing.\nMaterials preparation\n\t\nHave multiple 'single-patient-use-bacterial/viral' filters and nose clips readily available.\nHave personal protection equipment (PPE), such as gloves and masks, and disinfectant wipes available.\n\t\t​NOTE: Refer to laboratory policies for donning and doffing of PPE and infection control guidelines.\n3. Patient preparation\nAnthropometry\n\t\nVerify the patient's information: first and last names, date of birth, birth sex, height, weight, and gender identity, if applicable.\nMeasure the patient's height without shoes, with feet together, standing as tall as possible with the eyes level and looking straight ahead, and the back flush against a wall or flat surface.\n\t\tNOTE: For patients unable to stand erect, height may be estimated using arm span. For patients aged 25 years or older, where height measurement has been made previously in the same laboratory, remeasuring height at subsequent visits within 1 year may not be necessary.\nUpdate weight measurement at each visit.\nRecord patient's usage of bronchodilators, dosage, time/date of last administration, and any medication allergies, such as salbutamol.\nOscillometry test preparation\n\t\nAsk the patient to sanitize their hands prior to entering the testing station.\nOutline the test duration of 30 s and the minimum requirement of three trials.\nExplain the sensation generated by the oscillations such as 'vibrations' or 'fluttering.'\nEnsure that the patient is seated properly in a slight 'chin-up' position with both feet on the floor. Avoid slouching against the back of the chair or leg crossing.",
    "Instruct the patient to breathe normally while holding their cheeks with their palm and fingers and using their thumbs to support the soft tissue of the jaw during measurements.\n\t\tNOTE: Cheek and floor of the mouth support is enforced to avoid upper airway shunt. If the cheeks and soft tissues of the mouth are not supported, flow measured at the mouth is lost in the motion of the upper airway wall.\nExplain to the patient that swallowing should be avoided and the tongue must be below the mouthpiece during the test.\n\t\t​NOTE: The instructions above apply to both children and adults. Depending on the age of the child, holding a picture or other forms of visual distraction in front of the child can help ensure that the head posture is maintained during the oscillometry recording period. For adults with cognitive impairment, consider having an accompanying person nearby to coach and calm the patient to breath normally. For patients with physical impairment, some oscillometry devices are portable, and can be brought to the patient bedside or wheelchair. Also consider asking the accompanying or another person to provide cheek and jaw support during tests.\n4. Software setup\nNOTE: Please refer to the manufacturer's instruction manual for individual instructions.\nNew patient setup\n\t\nSelect New Patient and enter the patient's information such as first and last names, date of birth, birth sex, height, weight, ethnicity (if applicable), and smoking history.\nCheck that all information entered is correct prior to selecting Standard Test.\nEnsure that the correct wavelength setup is selected. In this demonstration, select Airwave Oscillometry from the Template dropdown menu. The choice of specific wavelengths and wavelength combinations will be different amongst the different manufacturers. Follow the software instruction manual for the specific device.",
    "Ensure the appropriate set of reference values is selected: Oostveen et al.56 or Brown et al.57 for adults, and Nowowiejska et al.58 for children ages 3 to 17.\n\t\tNOTE: The preferred and availability of reference values may differ depending on each laboratory's policy and oscillometry device manufacturer.\nExisting patient setup\n\t\nClick on Select Patient and choose the correct patient's file by verifying their information such as first and last names and date of birth.\nEnsure patient's weight and height (if applicable) are updated prior to the start of testing.\nSelect Standard Test and choose Airwave Oscillometry from the Template dropdown menu. See also section 4.1.3.\n5. Testing procedure\nOscillometry device setup\n\t\nAttach a 'single-patient-use-bacterial/viral' filter to the oscillometry device.\nEnsure the oscillometry device is ready in the testing mode.\nSpectral measurement\n\tNOTE: Airwave oscillometry 5-37 Hz in the device shown in the video.\n\t\nRemind the patient of the 30 s test duration and the minimum requirement of three measurements.\nInstruct the patient to wear a nose clip and provide instructions described in step 3.2.4 and step 3.2.5.\nAdjust the oscillometry device to the patient's head level.\nInstruct the patient to wet his/her lips before wrapping them around the mouthpiece to form a proper, tight seal. Instruct the patient to begin to breathe normally.\n\t\tNOTE: Inspect for potential air leaks around the mouthpiece and nose clip. Supplementary oxygen must be turned off during measurements to avoid any drift into the oscillometry device.\nObserve the patient's breathing pattern and start recording following a minimum of three stable tidal breaths.\n\t\tNOTE: (Optional): During the test, inform the patient of the time remaining during each measurement.\nProvide adequate rest time in between each measurement and adjust accordingly, based on the patient.",
    "NOTE: Patients on supplemental oxygen may require longer rest intervals. Provide supplemental oxygen as needed during the rest intervals.\nFollowing a minimum of three measurements, proceed to Step 6 to assess acceptability and reproducibility.\nPost-bronchodilator response - optional\n\t\nAdminister bronchodilator (salbutamol or ipratropium bromide) via a spacer.\nRecord the method and number of doses administered.\nWait for 10 min post-salbutamol/albuterol and 20 min post-ipratropium bromide inhalation.\nRepeat Step 5.2 to assess post-bronchodilator response\n10 Hz (intra-breath) measurement - optional\n\t\nRemind the patient that each test duration is 30 s and a minimum of three measurements will be obtained.\nEnsure that the correct wavelength setup for intra-breath measurement is selected.\nRepeat Steps 5.2.2 to 5.2.6.\n6. Access acceptability and reproducibility\nAcceptability\n\t\nEnsure that the measurements have a validity greater than 70%.\nCheck that the symbol beside the measurements have obtained a checkmark.\n\t\tNOTE: If a 'Caution' symbol is present, the measurement is unacceptable.\nInspect each measurement for anomalies or artefacts that may be caused by coughing, tongue obstruction, glottis closure, air leakage around the mouthpiece, attempting to talk, swallowing, and taking a deep breath.\n\t\tNOTE: If the patient is observed taking a deep breath, reset the oscillometry device, as forceful breaths disrupt the motors and the quality of subsequent measurements. To reset, stop testing and then click Zero Channels.\nReview measurements automatically excluded by the software; these include anomalies or artefacts such as cough or glottis closure.\nExclude any unacceptable measurement with anomalies outlined in Step 6.1.3 and repeat Step 5.2 to obtain additional measurements.\nReproducibility\n\t\nEnsure that a minimum of three acceptable measurements are recorded.\nEnsure that the coefficient of variance (CoV) of Rrs (resistance of respiratory system) is ≤10% in adults and ≤15% in children.",
    "Repeat Step 5.2 to obtain additional measurements if the 3 acceptable measurements have CoV >10% in adults and >15% in children.\nRepeat 6.1 to determine acceptability and report three acceptable measurements with CoV ≤10% in adults and ≤15% in children.\n7. Disinfection\nDiscard patient's mouthpiece and nose clip into the wastebin.\nUse disinfectant wipes to clean the oscillometry device and patient's chair.\nDoff gloves and sanitize hands.\nPlace the red dust cap back onto the oscillometry device to avoid any contamination.\n\tNOTE: Each laboratory's infection control policy may be different.\n8. Reporting results\nNOTE: Refer to Figure 3 for details.\nInclude patient's first and last names, height, weight, age, birth sex, BMI, and smoking history.\nInclude device name, model, software version, and manufacturer.\nInclude input signal frequencies and duration of individual recordings.\nReport the mean of acceptable and reproducible measurements and the CoV for these reported measurements.\n\tNOTE: If the CoV is higher than the specified upper limit, the results should be flagged so that the interpreting physician may interpret the results with caution.\nSelect reference equations.\nInclude impedance graph demonstrating Rrs and Xrs versus oscillation frequency.\nInclude post-bronchodilator response with dosage and method of administration including z-scores and absolute percentage change - optional\n9. Quality control/quality assurance\nPerform regular audits (weekly or monthly) depending on the volume of oscillometry testing in the laboratory.\nAssess each operator using a standardized checklist to ensure oscillometry tests are conducted accurately and professionally.\nProvide regular feedback to operators and hold quarterly quality assurance meetings to reflect on laboratory matters.\nEnsure biologic quality controls are conducted weekly with at least two healthy non-smoking subjects, and measurements are within ±2SD of their mean baseline.\n\tNOTE: This is extremely important for validating testing equipment and procedures when there are multiple oscillometry devices in the laboratory.",
