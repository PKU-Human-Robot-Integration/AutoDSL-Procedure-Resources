On average, 1 well of a 6-well plate contains around 2 × 106 NCSC.\nThawing and expansion of neurofibroma-derived Fbs.\nPrepare a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube with 10 mL of complete DMEM.\nThaw 1 cryovial of Fbs in a water bath at 37°C and transfer its content into the 15 mL conical centrifuge tube containing complete DMEM.",
    "Centrifuge cells at 300 × g for 5 min at 22°C.\nDiscard supernatant.\nResuspend cells with 10 mL of complete DMEM media and transfer into a 100 mm uncoated culture dish. Place the culture at 37°C with 5% CO2. Grow Fbs in 100 mm dishes until they reach 70%–80% confluency (See “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]” step 3).\nExpand Fbs as necessary to generate neurofibromaspheres at step 4.\nNote: Calculate the number of 100 mm dishes containing Fbs to be prepared depending on the number of AggreWell microwells to be used. On average, 1 dish of 100 mm contains around 1–2 × 106 Fbs.\nGeneration of neurofibromaspheres\nTiming: 14 days\nThe purpose of this step is to generate neurofibromaspheres composed of NF1(−/−) iPSC-derived differentiating SCs mixed with neurofibroma-derived NF1 (+/-) Fbs in AggreWell 800 24-well plates. Each well of the 24-well plate contains 300 microcavities which allow the generation of 300 neurofibromaspheres.\nWe describe the procedure to prepare 1 well of an AggreWell 800 24-well plate. To prepare more wells, the number of NCSCs and Fbs plates to be prepared should be scaled, accordingly.\nDifferentiating NCSC towards SC in 2D for 5 days. Based on the protocol described by Ziegler et al.,10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] with modifications.\nPreparing poly-L-Lysine and laminin-coated 6-well plates.\nCoat 6-well plates with 1 mL/well of 0.1 mg/mL Poly-L-Lysine for 1 h at 22°C.\nAspirate Poly-L-Lysine and wash 2 times with PBS.\nAdd 1 mL of 4 μg/mL laminin/well for 1 h at 37°C or 16 h at 4°C.\nAspirate laminin and wash 2 times with PBS.\nPlates are left in PBS until used.\nCritical: Never let coated plates dry. If the incubation with laminin is at 4°C, plates must be sealed with plastic film to avoid evaporation.",
    "Note: Plates can be stored at 4°C for several days.

We propose two different ways of validation. One is straightforward and relies on the detection of SC marker expression by immunofluorescence (Validation 1). The second is optional and relies on the transcriptome analysis of neurofibromasheres to get a better sense of cellular heterogeneity within neurofibromaspheres (Validation 2).\nValidation 1: Detection of SC lineage markers by immunofluorescence of neurofibromaspheres\nTiming: 2 days\nThe purpose of this step is to confirm the expression of p75 and S100B, two SC markers, in neurofibromaspheres.",
