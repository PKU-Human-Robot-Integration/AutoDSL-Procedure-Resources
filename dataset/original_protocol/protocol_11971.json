    "1. Designing and Constructing the gRNA Expression Vector\nTo precisely replace a long defined region of an exon, use a dual gRNA approach6, in which each gRNA can specifically target two ends of the selected region of interest. To obtain an accurate gene-specific spatiotemporal expression of the driver, select two gRNA target sites within the first coding exon of the gene.\nFor Drosophila melanogaster, select the gRNA target sites using the flyCRISPR Optimal Target Finder tool (http://tools.flycrispr.molbio.wisc.edu/targetFinder/). Other available CRISPR design tools can be used as well, including the Optimized CRISPR Design tool (http://crispr.mit.edu), FlyCas9 (https://shigen.nig.ac.jp/fly/nigfly/cas9), and E-CRISP (www.e-crisp.org/E-CRISP).\n\tNOTE: The following protocols of gRNA design and cloning was adopted from methods previously described6,7.\n\t\nCopy the actual sequence into the box provided in the online tool. Select the most recently released Drosophila melanogaster genome annotation version, “r_6,” in the drop-down menu for “Select genome.” In the field “Select guide length (nt),” input“20.” Select to find “All CRISPR targets” and click “Find CRISPR Targets”.\nEvaluate all the candidate gRNA targets by setting “Maximum” for “Stringency” and “NGG Only” for “PAM”. Try to select the gRNA sites without any potential off-targets or a minimum number of off-targets possible. Use the web-tool described in Doench et al. 2014 8 to select gRNAs with a potential “good” activity score.\nSimultaneously, ensure that there is no single nucleotide polymorphism in the gRNA targets in the genome of the parent fly line selected for injection (e.g., nos-Cas9 on X chromosome, BL# 54591). Follow the protocol described in Gratz et al. 20157 to extract the genomic DNA from the parent fly line. PCR amplify, approximately, the 500–1,000 nt regions using primers that flank the sequence of interest and a high-fidelity DNA polymerase; sequence-verify the PCR amplified products.",
    "For generating a tandem gRNA expression vector, follow a ligation-independent cloning protocol6 to introduce two protospacer sequences into a pCFD4 RNA expression vector. Note that an improved multi-gRNA expression vector (pCFD5) is now available where both the sgRNAs are expressed from the strong U6:3 promoters9 (https://www.crisprflydesign.org). Use a DNA Assembly method to clone the gRNAs into the pCFD4 vector.\nDesign and order the forward and reverse primers for introducing two protospacer sequences into the RNA expression vector pCFD4 (Table 1A). As previously described6, the forward primer contains the first protospacer sequence flanked by regions corresponding to the U6-1 promoter and gRNA core in pCFD4; the reverse primer contains the reverse complement sequence of the second protospacer flanked by regions corresponding to the gRNA core and U6-3 promoter in pCDF4.\nResuspend primers to 100 μM with DNase and RNase-free double distilled water (ddH2O). Make a 10 μM working concentration primer. Use pCFD4 plasmid as a template and set up PCR reaction using a high-fidelity polymerase and recommended settings for PCR reaction6.\nTo clone the amplified product into pCFD4, digest pCFD4 plasmid with BbsI enzyme by setting up the following reaction: 2–5 μg of pCFD4 plasmid, 5 μL of 10x digestion buffer, 1 μL of BbsI enzyme, and ddH2O to bring the final volume to 50 μL. Mix the reaction contents by gently tapping the tube and collecting all the scattered droplets from the wall of the tube to the bottom by a brief spin. Incubate the reaction mix at 37 °C for 2 h.",
    "Run the PCR product from step 2 and the digested product from step 3 on a 1% agarose gel. Perform the electrophoresis for enough time to completely separate the DNA bands. Cut the correct sized DNA bands under a UV trans-illuminator before purifying the expected products using gel elution column following the manufacturer’s instruction (see Table of Materials). The PCR product should be 600 bp, and the linearized pCFD4 plasmid should be ~6.4 kb 6.\nSet up the DNA assembly reaction in a PCR tube, per the manufacturer’s instruction (see Table of Materials).\nTransform 2 μL of the assembly product into competent bacteria (DH5α or similar strains with ΔrecA1, ΔendA1), plate on Ampicillin (100 μg/mL) containing LB (LB/Amp) agar plates, and incubate at 37 °C overnight. Note that the DNA assembly mix might be toxic to certain bacteria strains, but diluting the assembly mix can reduce the toxicity.\nPick 3–4 ampicillin-resistant colonies from the overnight-incubated plate, inoculate the colony in 3 mL LB containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin, and grow inoculated bacteria in a 37 °C shaker overnight. Extract plasmid from the overnight-cultured bacteria using the plasmid mini-prep kit following the manufacturer’s instruction (see Table of Materials).\nSequence the plasmids with T3 universal primer to screen for the correct clones containing the tandem gRNA insertion. Establish a glycerol stock of bacteria transformed with a sequence-verified pCFD4-gRNA in 20% glycerol and store in a -80 °C freezer for future use.\n2. Designing and Constructing the HDR Donor\nFor genomic knock-in of a Gal4 or LexA sequence, design a double-stranded HDR donor containing the transactivator sequence flanked by two homology arms.\nUse >1.5 kb left and right homology arms flanking the gRNA targeting site(s). Extended homology arms increase the efficiency of HDR during the repair process 10.",
    "PCR amplify the homology arms from the genomic DNA (gDNA) extracted from the parent fly line selected for injection (e.g., nos-Cas9 (on X chromosome), BL# 54591). Use a proof-reading hot-start Taq-DNA polymerase enzyme suitable for long PCR extension (see Table of Materials). Sequence-verify.\nTo avoid retargeting of the gRNA to the engineered locus, design the replacement donor in such a way that the gRNA recognition sites are disrupted by the exogenous sequence introduced.\n\tNOTE: to avoid altering the putative cis-regulatory elements, always select the gRNA recognition sites within the coding exon region.\nFor generating a replacement cassette, plan the DNA Assembly strategy to join four segments together: the 5’ and 3’ homology arms, the middle exogenous transactivator DNA sequence, and the linearized cloning vector backbone (e.g., pUC19 or other commonly used cloning vectors). Following the manufacturer’s guideline for DNA assembly (see Table of Materials), design the suitable primers for PCR amplification and assembly of each segment. Resuspend primers to 100 μM with ddH2O. Make a 10 μM working concentration primer. Use high-fidelity polymerase for all the PCR reactions. Follow the following protocol:\nPCR amplify a Gal4 or LexA expression cassette from an available vector (e.g., nls-LexA:p65; the ideal Gal4/LexA/QF2 expression plasmids can be found and obtained from common resources such as Addgene) using the primers listed in Table 1B.\n\t\t\nTo retain all the original transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations of the replaced exon on the expression of the transactivator DNA sequence, design the cassette in such a way that the edited genomic allele would express a chimeric mRNA of the transactivator and the gene. Preserve the 5’ and 3’ end of the targeted exon to retain any splicing signal.",
    "Incorporate a T2A self-cleaving peptide sequence between the residual 5’ coding exon and the transactivator sequence to prevent translation into a chimeric protein. Add a translation stop codon after the exogenous transactivator sequence (Figure 5).\nPCR amplify the homology arms from the genomic DNA (gDNA) extracted from the parent fly line selected for injection (e.g., nos-Cas9 (on X chromosome), BL# 54591) using the primers listed in Table 1B. Use high-fidelity polymerase for all the PCR reactions using the systems as follows: 5 μL of 5x Reaction Buffer, 0.5 μL of 10 mM dNTPs, 1.25 μL of 10 μM Forward Primer, 1.25 μL of 10 μM Reverse Primer, 0.5 μL of Template DNA, 0.25 μL of High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase, 16.25 μL of ddH2O.\nUse linearized cloning vector such as pUC19. A number of donor vectors are now available. See a comprehensive list at the following website- http://flycrispr.molbio.wisc.edu.\nRun the PCR products on a 1% agarose gel. Perform the electrophoresis for enough time to ensure a clear separation of the desired band from the undesired non-specific bands (if any). Gel-purify the expected DNA fragments. Measure the concentration of each purified DNA fragment using a spectrophotometer.\nSet up the DNA assembly reaction following the manufacturer’s instruction. Mix the linearized cloning vector and target fragments from step 3 and step 4 in the following reaction: 1 μL of linear cloning vector (50 ng/μL), 2–3 fold excess of each target fragment, 10 μL of 2x DNA assembly master mix, bring the final reaction volume to 20 μL with ddH2O. Incubate the reaction mix for 1 hour at 50 °C.\nTransform 2 μL of the assembly product into competent bacteria, plate on LB/Amp agar plates containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin. Also, add X-Gal + IPTG on the plate for blue/white screening.",
    "Pick 3–4 white colonies from the overnight-incubated plate, inoculate the colony in 3 mL LB containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin, and grow at 37 °C overnight in a shaker. Extract plasmid from the overnight-cultured bacteria using the plasmid mini-prep kit following the manufacturer’s manual (see Table of Materials).\nScreen the positive colony by PCR or restriction digestion.\nSequence verify the HDR donor region of the final plasmid. Save a bacterial stock transformed with the correct clones in 20% glycerol at -80 °C for future inoculation.\n3. Embryo Injection, Fly Genetics and Screening for Genome Editing\nPrepare the high purity endotoxin-free gRNA expression vector as well as the HDR donor plasmid using a plasmid maxiprep kit (see Table of Materials).\nCo-inject the gRNA expression plasmid (100 ng/μL) and the replacement donor (500 ng/μL) into the germline of nos-Cas9 embryos6. Note: we use a commercial service for injection, but this procedure can be performed in the laboratory as well.\nFly genetics and screening (Figure 2 and Figure 3):\nWhen the injected embryos develop into adults, cross each single G0 flies to balancer flies. Select suitable balancer for the chromosome containing the targeted allele.\nAnesthetize the F1 offspring from each G0 cross on a CO2 pad and randomly pick 10-20 males under a stereomicroscope. Cross them individually to the balancer females as shown in Figure 3.\nWhen the F2 larvae hatch, pick the single F1 father from each cross and extract gDNA using the single fly genomic DNA preparation protocol:\n\t\t\nPrepare gDNA extraction buffer: 10 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.2, 1 mM EDTA, 25 mM NaCl, store at room temperature. Prepare 20 mg/mL Proteinase K stock solution and store in the freezer.\nPut each fly in a 1.5 mL micro-centrifuge tube and label the tube. Keep in the -80 °C freezer overnight.",
    "Prepare a fresh working volume of gDNA extraction buffer containing 200 µg/mL final concentration of Proteinase K.\n\t\t\tNote: Do not use an old buffer for this step.\nSquish each fly for 10–15 s with a pipette tip containing 50 μL of squishing buffer without dispensing the liquid. Dispense the remaining buffer into the tube and mix well. Incubate at 37 °C for 20–30 min.\nPut tubes in 95 °C heat block for 1–2 min to inactivate the Proteinase K.\nSpin down for 5 min at 10,000 x g. Store the preparation at 4 °C for further PCR analysis.\nUse the same method to prepare gDNA from a nos-Cas9 fly, which serves as a negative control. Perform three-step PCR based screens to identify the correct “ends out” HDR (Figure 2, Figure 5) using gDNA of each F1 male as a template5. Use 1 μL of the DNA prep in the following PCR reaction system: 10 μL of 2x PCR Master Mix with Dye, 1 μL of each primer (10 μM), 1 μL of DNA template, and 7 μL of ddH2O.\nAs shown in Figure 5A, perform PCR using primers fwd1 and rev1 to screen for the existence of the insertion or replacement; perform PCR using fwd2 and rev2 primers to verify the insertion or replacement from 3’ region; perform PCR using primers M13F and rev3 to check “ends-in” HDR (Table 1C).\nKeep the fly lines with the confirmed ends-out HDR and establish balanced stocks from the F2 generation. Outcross to the balancer flies again to remove any unintended mutations on other chromosomes.",
    "Prepare high-quality gDNA from the established stocks for amplifying long PCR (>800–1,000 nt) amplicon with high-fidelity Taq polymerase and fully sequence verify the amplicons obtained from the engineered genomic regions. Alternatively, use crude gDNA extract as described earlier to amplify shorter (<800 nt), overlapping PCR products to sequence-validate the edited genome. Use the following protocol to prepare the good quality Drosophila genomic DNA:\nPut about 25 adult flies in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, and freeze in -20 °C or -80 °C freezer for at least 1 hour.\nAdd 250 μL of Solution A (pH 9.0 Tris HCl 0.1 M, EDTA 0.1 M, SDS 1%).\nHomogenize the flies using the homogenizing pestles in microcentrifuge tubes, and put the tube on ice.\nIncubate at 70 °C for 30 min.\nAdd 35 μL of KOAc (5 M), shake, and mix well, but do not vortex.\nIncubate on ice for 30 min.\nSpin at 12,000 x g for 15 min.\nWith a 1 mL micropipette, carefully transfer only the clear supernatant to a new tube, leaving back any precipitate or interphase.\nAdd 150 μL of isopropanol to the supernatant. Gently mix by inversion.\nSpin at 10,000 x g for 5 min.\nCarefully remove the supernatant and leave the pellet in the tube.\nWash the pellet with 1 mL 70% EtOH.\nSpin at 12,000 x g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant. Air dry the pellet for 15 to 20 min. Do not over dry the pellet.\nDissolve the pellet in 100 μL of ddH2O.\nUse high fidelity DNA polymerase suitable for long amplicon (>800 bp) to amplify the complete edited region. Ideally, take two primers outside the inserted cassette to amplify the genomic region. Gel purify the PCR product, and as described earlier, sequence verify the product with multiple overlapping primers.",
    "Validate the correct spatiotemporal expression patterns from dissected tissues/embryos of the engineered fly lines:\nPerform RT-PCR from the total RNA to verify the expression of the hybrid mRNA product (Table 1D).\nPerform an in situ hybridization of the mRNA product of the interest in the larval tissues/embryo to validate the expression.\nTo screen for the accurate tissue-specific spatiotemporal expression patterns among the sequence-verified ends-out lines, cross each of the edited lines obtained for the binary expression driver with the LexO-GFP or LexO-RFP (for LexA driver) line (available from the Bloomington stock centers) and observe the LexA or Gal4 driven reporter-gene expression in embryo, larval, and adult tissues under a fluorescence microscope.\nSubscription Required.
