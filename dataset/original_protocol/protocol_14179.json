  "procedures": [
    "Procedures involving animal subjects have been approved by the Animal Care Committee at National Defense Medical Center, Taiwan (R.O.C). This study was conducted in the Laboratory Animal Center at the National Defense Medical Center. Swine weighing between 20 and 25 kg has been successfully instrumented using this protocol.\n1. Adaptation of the Animals to Human Handling\nAfter arrival in the facility, house the animals solitarily but let them interact with each other.\nProvide the animals ad libitum access to food and water.\nAcclimate swine to human handling and transportation from the animal facility to the experimental laboratory by handling the animal at least once a day for one week.\nFast the animal for at least 12 hours before surgery to prevent nausea, vomiting, and aspiration of stomach fluids.\n2. Sedation\nBefore the burn wound creation, sedate animals via an intravenous injection with Zoletil 50 (25 mg/kg).\n3. Intubation and Ventilation\nPlace the animal on a table and/or trolley in sternal position.\nOpen the mouth of the animal with an oral spreader.\nIn case of insufficient relaxation of the jaws or presence of swallowing reflexes, which hinder intubation, mask the swine with isoflurane to induce sedation.\nMonitor blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature by physiological signal monitor during the surgery to prevent potential complications.\n4. Anesthesia\nInduce and maintain anesthesia; preferably anesthetize the animal via an intramuscular injection of tiletamine and zolazepam (25 mg/kg + 25 mg/kg).\nIntubate the animal with the endotracheal tube when muscle relaxation, characterized by loss of jaw tone and palpebral reflexed, was observed.\nMaintain all pigs in an anesthetic state at a vaporizer setting of 0.5–2.5% (v/v) isoflurane until the end of the surgery.",
    "Examine the depth of anesthesia by testing pain reflexes with a hind leg toe pinch before surgery. When necessary, add additional anesthesia or wait for a few minutes. Check pain reflexes regularly throughout the surgery.\n5. Sterilization of the Surgical Site\nShave and clean the skin of the animal over an area of approximately 25 cm width from the vertebral column all the way to the axilla on both sides.\nScrub the moisturized skin with povidone-iodine scrub (75 mg/mL) for approximately 5 min.\nRemove the povidone-iodine soap from the skin using wet sterile gauzes.\nSterilize the skin with povidone-iodine lotion (100 mg/mL).\nCover the animal with sterile surgical drapes to reduce bacterial transfer and subsequent contamination of the surgical site.\n6. Burn Wound Creation\nUse a surgical marking pen to mark the center of six burn wounds symmetrically on the dorsum of the pig. Ensure that the distance between each burn wound is at least greater than the radius of the wound (Figure 1A).\nFill a modified soldering iron with 50 mL of glycerin and insert an electronic thermometer into it to monitor the temperature. The hot iron possesses a flat area of approximately 9 cm2 (Figure 1B).\nHeat up the iron to 137–139 °C with a hot plate (Figure 1C).\nCreate six uniform burn wounds by placing the iron on the marked area without applying any force for 30 seconds (Figure 1C).\nWash the burn wounds with 0.9% saline solution (Figure 1D).\nMeasure wound dimensions and record the wound by photomicrography (Figure 1E).\n7. Preparation of Dressings\nCover each wound with the inner contact layer of a four-layer clinical dressing through direct contact. For this layer, use CAPS-containing dressing or alternative materials (Figure 1F).",
    "Apply a waterproof film onto the clinical dressing to serve as a barrier against bacterial penetration (Figure 1F).\nCover each wound with a gauze (0.5 cm thick) and fix with paper tape to serve as the mid-layer of the dressing (Figure 1G).\nSecure the gauze with an outer layer of adhesive plaster. Extend this layer to the torso to avoid the displacement of the dressing (Figure 1H-1J).\n8. Post-burn Care and Measurement\nInject the swine with buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg, IM) for pain management for every 8-12 h, starting before recovery from anesthesia, for one week to reduce potential pain.\nAllow the pig free access to feed and water.\nChange the clinical dressings every 2 days for the first 10 days and then twice a week for the 6-week study.\nClean and measure wounds before reapplying clinical dressings. Administer anesthetics during dressing changes.\nRecord the wound by photomicrography for comparison of wound healing rate every 2 days for the first 10 days and then twice a week for the 6-week study.\nCalculate the wound re-epithelialization or contraction as the percentage of the original wound size according to a previously described method. The analysis of wound closure was conducted in a double-blinded manner.\nMeasure the burn scar using VSS, which consists of four variables: vascularity, height (thickness), pliability, and pigmentation on post-burn days 0, 7, 21, and 42. Each variable has four to six possible scores. The total score ranges from 0 to 14, whereby a score of 0 reflects normal skin.\n9. Bacterial Growth Experiments of Post-burn Tissues\nSwab the wound for antibacterial testing on post-burn days 0, 7, 21, and 42.\nPlace the swab into 100 mL of 0.9% sterile saline solution and gently vortex to achieve a homogenous suspension.",
    "Serially dilute (10−1–10−5) the homogenate and plate 100 μL of each dilution in selective and nonselective media, respectively.\nIncubate all dilutions under aerobic conditions at 37 °C for 24–72 hours.\nPlate triplicate aliquots of 10 μL each from all dilutions onto blood agar plate supplemented with 5% sheep blood to isolate aerobic Gram-positive organisms.\nIncubate the sample by spreading or pouring the sample uniformly on the surface of an agar plate overnight for determining the number of colony-forming units (CFUs).\nRead the plates after overnight incubation. Invert the sheep blood agar plate and divide the bottom of the dish into four equal quadrants using a marker and small ruler.\nPlace the plate onto the stage of a dissection microscope and count the colonies on each plate. By definition, a colony must have a minimum of 300 CFU to be enumerated.\nCount the bacterial colonies in each of the three replicates. Calculate the average value of the three replicates. Determine the CFU per plate by multiplying the average value by the final dilution factor.\n10. Euthanasia and Tissue Fixation\nIntravenously inject an overdose of sodium pentobarbital euthanasia solution (80–120 mg/kg).\nPerform en bloc excision of burn wound tissue to include the underlying musculature and surrounding unwounded tissue.\nFix tissues with 10% neutral buffered formalin.\n\t\nMix 10 mL of formaldehyde (37%) in 90 mL of phosphate buffered solution (PBS) and store in 4 °C.\nTransfer tissues to fixative and swirl the container to ensure all tissues are completely immersed in fixative. The volume of fixative must be 30 times the tissue volume.\nFix tissues overnight at 4 ˚C.\nDehydrate tissues with ethanol and embed into paraffin blocks. Perform the following steps at 4 ˚C on a shaker.\n\t\nWash twice with PBS for 30 minutes.",
    "Dehydrate tissues with 70% ethanol for 8 hours, 80% ethanol overnight, 95% ethanol for 8 hours, and then in 100% ethanol overnight.\nIncubate tissues in 100% ethanol for a further 8 hours.\nIncubate tissues in three changes of xylene each for 30 minutes.\nReplace the xylene with freshly melted (52 °C) wax, and incubate at 52 °C in an oven for 1 hour.\nReplace the wax with fresh wax and incubate at 52 °C in an oven for 3 hours, and then replace once more and incubate at 52 °C overnight.\nIncubate tissues with two more changes of wax each for 1 hour, and then embed the tissue and store at 4 °C.\nCut and stain the paraffin-embedded sections with HE, and visualize via a light microscope with 100× magnification.\n\t\nCreate paraffin sections using a rotary microtome.\nDewax sections with three changes of xylene each for 3 minutes.\nRehydrate tissues with 100%, 95%, 80%, and 70% ethanol each for 3 minutes, and then immerse in distilled water.\nStain with hematoxylin for 10 minutes, and then rinse in running tap water.\nDifferentiate with 0.1% hydrochloric acid ethanol for 5 minutes, and rinse in tap water.\nStain with 0.5% eosin for 1 minute.\nDehydrate tissues with 70%, 80%, 95%, and 100% ethanol each for 2 minutes.\nClear the staining with xylene, and dry in fume hood.\nSubscription Required.
