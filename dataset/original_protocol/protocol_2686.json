Two- to three-month-old-mice are used for this procedure.\nAnesthetize the mouse with 3% isoflurane in 100% oxygen in the induction chamber to ensure the mouse is well anesthetized in the induction chamber prior to being positioned on the board.\nObserve the mouse to see whether there is any sign of movement. Confirm the depth of anesthesia by pinching the mouse’s paw.\nIf the mouse does not respond, remove the mouse from the chamber and place it in the prone position on a 37°C temperature heating pad.\nInsert the mouse’s muzzle into an anesthesia mask for anesthesia maintenance with 1.5% isoflurane and 100% oxygen.\nApply hair removal cream to remove fur from the hindlimb and treat the skin with iodine and 70% ethanol.\nNote: We have not found any potential influence of meloxicam on the vascular endothelial cell viability under hypoxic condition.\nMake a small incision (1 cm) in the thigh from which the fur has been removed.\nUse a retractor to pull back the wound. For the next steps (8–12), use a dissection microscope with more than 10× magnification to allow an enlarged view of the surgery region (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2341-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Anatomy of the mouse hindlimb showing induction of ischemia\nEach representative image shows a process from steps 6 to 12 of the ischemic surgery.\n(A) The dotted box indicates the incision area in the hindlimb (steps 6 and 7).\n(B) Exposure of the neurovascular bundle (step 8).\n(C) Separation of the femoral artery from the femoral vein and nerve (steps 9 and 10).",
    "(D) Passage of sutures under the proximal and distal femoral artery (step 11).\n(E) Ligation (step 11).\n(F) Transection of the artery (step 12).\nExpose the neurovascular bundle by carefully moving the peritoneum proximally with forceps and cotton-tipped applicators.\nDissect the femoral artery and vein using forceps and cotton-tipped applicators.\nSeparate them from femoral nerve to avoid nerve damage during femoral artery ligation.\nContinue to apply sterile 1× PBS to the area to prevent it from drying out.\nSeparate the femoral artery from the femoral vein using angled forceps so as not to damage the femoral vein during femoral artery ligation. Continue to apply sterile 1× PBS to the area to prevent it from drying out.\nThread a strand of 7-0 suture under the proximal and distal femoral artery and ligate using both strands of the suture with 2 knots in each. Cut off the excess suture.\nTransect the femoral artery in the section located between the distal and proximal knots using spring scissors.\nNote: Take care not to cause any damage to the femoral vein or bleeding from the severed vessel.\nRemove the retractor and close the incision size 6-0 silk sutures.\nInject the mouse via intraperitoneal (IP) injection with Meloxicam (5 mg/kg body weight).\nAlternatives: Carprofen or Ketoprofen at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight can be used through subcutaneous (SC) injection as analgesics instead of meloxicam.\nCritical: Treat the mouse with Meloxicam (5 mg/kg body weight) every 24 h for 4 days from the day of surgery.\nApply topical lidocaine ointment to the sutured area.\nOnce the surgery has been completed, place the mouse on a draped heated pad in a new cage (clean, with fresh bedding) to prevent post-surgical complications.",
    "Monitor the mouse continuously until it is awake, and then place the mouse into a new cage until the end of the experiment.\nCritical: Perform post-procedural care daily (at least 5 times/week) to monitor for signs of complications by checking the appearance, behavior, physical condition, and body weight of the mouse. Postoperative observation will include eating, drinking, and movement. Euthanize mice developing any of the following signs: weight loss greater than 20%, wound infection, respiratory distress, or intractable dehydration. Based on pain criteria set by the laboratory, you may use another dose of meloxicam. If there are indications of dehydration, you may administer 1 mL sterile 0.9% sodium chloride subcutaneously.\nBlood perfusion analysis\nTiming: up to 30 min per mouse\nTo determine perfusion recovery, measure surface blood perfusion in the hindlimbs using a Laser Speckle Contrast Analyzer (LASCA) on the day of surgery (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2341-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Laser speckle contrast imaging (LASCA)\n(A) Set up LASCA.\n(B) Mouse position on the operating table. A rectangular laser (pink) indicates the scanning area for blood perfusion imaging. The inset (dotted box) shows a magnified image.\n(C) Blood perfusion imaging on the day of ischemic surgery. The left and right hindlimbs show blood flow in injured and uninjured areas, respectively. The uninjured leg served as an internal control.\n(D) Blood perfusion imaging analysis in the region of interest (ROI). Polygonal gates indicate ROI.\nTurn on the LASCA and open its software (PIMSoft; Perimed Inc., Las Vegas, NV).\nSet up the LASCA software in a section of the project editor using the following parameters:\nWorking distance: 10.4 cm.\nMeasurement area: 2.9 cm (width), 2.2 cm (height).\nPoint density: high.\nResolution: 0.02 mm.\nImage capture frame rate: 6 images/s for 1 min.",
    "Anesthetize the mouse with 3% isoflurane in 100% oxygen in the induction chamber to ensure the mouse is well anesthetized in the induction chamber prior to being positioned on the board.\nObserve the mouse to see whether there is any sign of movement. Confirm the depth of anesthesia by pinching the mouse’s paw.\nIf the mouse does not respond, remove the mouse from the chamber and place it in the prone position on the LASCA plate with a 37°C temperature heating pad.\nAdminister a continuous flow of isoflurane to the mouse by connecting the mouse’s muzzle to an anesthesia mask with 1.5% isoflurane and 100% oxygen (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nCritical: The mouse must be placed on a 37°C heated surface at least 5 min before the blood perfusion analysis. Keep the room temperature between 20°C and 25°C. Temperature changes will affect the results of the blood perfusion image analysis (see limitations[href=https://www.wicell.org#limitations]).\nOpen a new file and position the visible red lasers (650 nm) at a region encompassing the hind foot to the toe of the mouse (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nPress the record button to start acquiring the blood perfusion image.\nThe complete acquisition data images will show a range of colors (blue-green-yellow-red), which indicates the average value of the blood perfusion intensity: closer to the minimum (blue) or maximum (red) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nTo analyze the acquired data, select the region of interest (ROI) in each ischemic region and uninjured region (internal control) to calculate a mean value of perfusion (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nRepeat these measurements every week or as needed until the experiment ends.\nNote: To check whether the femoral artery ligation is successfully performed, analysis with the LASCA must be performed on the same day of the surgery.\nPreparation of a single cell suspension from the hindlimb tissue",
    "Timing: up to 2 h\nThis section describes the detailed steps used to dissociate hindlimb tissues needed to prepare single cell suspensions for subsequent experiments such as cell sorting, gene expression and next generation sequencing (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2341-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Tissue harvesting from thigh muscles for single cell dissociation\n(A) Skin removal from the mouse leg.\n(B) Dissection of the medial thigh muscles.\n(C) Transfer of muscle tissue to a microscope slide in a petri dish on ice.\n(D) Chopping the muscle tissue using a razor blade.\nEuthanize the mouse using CO2 for 5 min.\nSpray the mouse with 70% ethanol to wet down the fur and treat the area around hindlimb aseptically.\nUse scissors and forceps to remove the skin from the whole femur (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nSeparate the medial thigh muscles from the femur bones where the distal and proximal suture knots exist and place the isolated muscle in cold 1× PBS (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nTransfer the muscle to a microscope slide in a petri dish on ice and mince it with a razor blade for 2–3 min until a fine paste results (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C and 3D).\nTransfer the minced muscle to a 50 mL tube containing 5 mL (per mouse) tissue dissociation buffer (2 mg/mL collagenase IV in 20% FBS/1× PBS).\nVortex the tube for 3–5 s at the highest speed.\nIncubate the tube in a shaking incubator at 37°C and 100 rpm for 45 min.\nOptional: During incubation, vortex the tube for 3–5 s every 15 min.\nCritical: Do not incubate the samples longer than 1 h in the dissociation buffer. Incubation beyond 1 h can cause increased cell death.",
    "Pass the single cell suspension solution through a 3 mL syringe attached to a 16 gauge needle 7–8 times and then through an 18 gauge needle attached to the same sized syringe until large particles are no longer observed visually.\nCritical: Do not use needles smaller than 18 gauge or syringes larger than 3 mL; either or both can cause increased cell death.\nAdd an equal volume of ice-cold 20% FBS/1× PBS without collagenase IV to the tube.\nCentrifuge at 4°C, 400 × g for 5 min and aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet with 10 mL ice-cold 20% FBS/1× PBS without collagenase IV.\nTransfer the solution sequentially into 100, 70, and 40 μm cell strainers and then centrifuge the filtered solution at 4°C, 400 × g for 5 min and aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet with 10 mL ice-cold 1× PBS, centrifuge at 4°C, 400 × g for 5 min and aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellets with 2 mL RBC lysis buffer and incubate at room temperature between 20°C and 25°C for 1 min.\nAdd 18 mL ice-cold 20% FBS/1× PBS to the tube.\nCentrifuge at 4°C, 400 × g for 5 min and aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet with 10 mL ice-cold 4% FBS/1× PBS, centrifuge at 4°C, 400 × g for 5 min, and aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet with 1 mL ice-cold 4% FBS/1× PBS.\nTransfer the cell suspension into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube or tubes appropriate for the subsequent experiments such as endothelial cell sorting.\nEndothelial cell sorting\nTiming: up to 3 h\nStaining of cell surface markers.\nPrepare compensation groups as follows:\nUnstained group.\nPhycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-mouse CD31 (1:300 dilution in 4% FBS/1× PBS).\nFluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse CD45 (1:300 dilution in 4% FBS/1× PBS).",
    "Prepare each group as follows: add 1 × 106 cells in 250 μL 4% FBS/1× PBS to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and then add the aforementioned antibody into the tubes (PE-CD31 and FITC-CD45), respectively.\nIncubate the tubes at 4°C for 20 min in the dark.\nAdd 1 mL ice-cold 4% FBS/1× PBS to each tube, centrifuge at 4°C, 400 × g for 5 min using a microcentrifuge (model: Legend Micro 21R) and aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet with 1 mL ice-cold 4% FBS/1× PBS and repeat step 49a vi twice.\nAdd 300 μL 4% FBS/1× PBS and transfer to a 5 mL cell culture tube for each group (unstained, PE-CD31 and FITC-CD45).\nKeep the tubes on ice in the dark until use. Begin cell sorting within 1 h.\nPrepare the sample for endothelial cell sorting as follows:\nAdd the rest of the cells to an appropriate tube(s). For better results, prepare several 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes containing 1 × 106 cells in 250 μL 4% FBS/1× PBS buffer per tube.\nAdd both PE-conjugated anti-mouse CD31 (1:300) and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse CD45 (1:300) antibodies into each tube.\nIncubate the tubes at 4°C for 20 min in the dark.\nAdd 1 mL ice-cold 4% FBS/1× PBS to each tube and combine all the tubes into a large appropriate tube(s) such as a 15 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge the tube(s) at 4°C, 400 × g for 5 min and aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet with 4 mL ice-cold 4% FBS/1× PBS per tube and repeat step 49 b v twice.\nResuspend the pellet with ice-cold 4% FBS/1× PBS (250 μL/1 × 106 cells) and transfer it to a 5 mL cell culture tube.\nKeep the tube on ice in the dark until use. Begin cell sorting within 1 h.",
    "Note: CD45 is a pan-leukocyte marker. CD31 is expressed in endothelial cells and in some hematopoietic cells.\nAlternatives: Other combinations of fluorophores including FITC-allophycocianin (APC), FITC-peridinin-chlorophyll-protein (PerCP), PE-APC, Alexa Fluor® 488-Alexa Fluor® 594 or 647 can be used for the cell staining (i.e., CD31 and CD45) instead of the FITC-PE combination.\nCritical: Use PBS which does not contain any Ca2+ and Mg2+ to reduce cell aggregation for step 47.\nEndothelial cell sorting using a cell sorter (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2341-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Endothelial cell sorting process\nPE conjugated-anti-mouse CD31 and FITC conjugated-anti-mouse CD45 antibodies were added to a tube containing a single cell suspension followed by incubation at 4°C for 20 min in the dark. The cells were then plotted for CD31 (PE) and CD45 (FITC) against an unstained control. Endothelial cells were sorted from the red polygonal gates on the plotted data. Figure reuse (flow cytometry) from Park et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] according to the policy of the American Heart Association. Others created with BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com].\nPrepare the compensation settings.\nAn unstained group (approximately 10,000 cells) must be recorded first as a negative control for each fluorescent intensity.\nRun the PE-conjugated anti-mouse CD31 group (approximately 10,000 cells) for the positive PE gate.\nRun the FITC-conjugated anti-mouse CD45 group (approximately 10,000 cells) for the positive FITC gate.\nAdjust the compensation settings with the built-in program.\nPrepare a 15 mL tube containing 7–8 mL 20% FBS/1× PBS for the endothelial cell collection.\nSet both tubes (sample tube and collection tube) on the cell sorter and run the sample to sort the targeted cell population (CD31+CD45-).\nCell sorting rate (cell number/s): 1,000–2,000 cells/s.\nEfficiency: > 80%.\nSorter nozzle size: 100 μm.\nPressure: 25 psi.\nCentrifuge the collection tube at 4°C, 400 × g for 5 min and aspirate the supernatant.",
    "Store the pellet at −80°C for use in subsequent experiments or resuspend the pellet with the appropriate solutions for any planned experiments.\nNote: It is difficult to calculate the exact total cell number per thigh muscle before cell sorting due to the presence of the debris. Generally, we obtain a total cell number of 2.0 × 106–3.0 × 106 per mouse (thigh muscle). The cell sorting rate can be increased with decreased efficiency.\nCritical: Invert the collection tube containing 7–8 mL 20% FBS/1× PBS several times before the sorting for better cell recovery."
