    "This experiment is designed to follow uptake of Na by the root tip and then its transport to the aerial parts of the seedling (Choi et al., 2014).Grow Arabidopsis wild type Columbia_0 (WT Col_0) on the surface of plant growth medium [including 0.5% (w/v) Phytagel] in 100 x 100 mm square Petri dishes for 10 days under long day conditions (16 h light/8 h dark).Cover the root tip (~5 mm of the root apex) for 1 h with a single layer Kimwipe strip (W x H: 30 x 5 mm) wetted with 50 µl of DI water (Figure 1A).After this acclimation period, soak the Kimwipe strip for a further 10 min with either 50 µl of DI water (control) or 50 µl of 100 mM NaCl (10 min salt stress). During these control and salt treatments, the Petri dishes should be raised ~15 mm at one end by placing them on a second empty Petri dish. This second Petri dish should be placed under the end of the Petri dish furthest from the seedling roots and closest to the cotyledon/shoot end of the plants (Figure 1B). This protocol ensures that the water or NaCl applied to the Kimwipe strip cannot passively flow along the surface of the plants toward the shoots.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150815/20150815195601_5191.pngFigure 1. Salt stress experiment performed in a square Petri dish. A. Top view of 100 x 100 mm Petri dish with ten, 10 d old Arabidopsis (seedlings). The root tips are covered with a single layer Kimwipe strip (W x H: 30 x 5 mm). B. Side view of Petri dish with raised shoot end to prevent passive liquid flow to shoot tissue. The petri dish is covered with a lid to keep humidity high inside of the Petri dish.",
    "Quickly rinse the tissues to be analyzed in DI water to remove any Na passively adhering to their surface.Harvest ~50 mg of fresh tissues and record the weight of each sample. For example, to obtain samples of ~50 mg from roots or shoots you will need at least 10 seedlings of 8-10 day old Arabidopsis plants per sample. You will also need to plan for at least three independent experiments with three technical replicates per experiment for robust statistical analyses.In a fume hood, digest each sample in a separate glass test tube (washed with 1% (vol/vol) nitric acid and dried prior to tissue digestion) in 0.6 ml of nitric acid at 120-150 °C for ~2 h or until all the plant tissues are completely dissolved. The 120 °C temperature is readily maintained using a heat block.Add a further 0.4 ml of 60% (vol/vol) HClO4 and incubate at 150-180 °C for an additional 2 h or until the total sample volume is reduced to ≤ 0.5 ml. There is no need to constantly shake or mix the sample.Cool to room temperature and add DI water up to 5 ml. The sodium concentration can now be determined using a Perkin-Elmer Optima 2000DV inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) or similar equipment according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For example, parameter settings for a Perkin-Elmer Optima 2000DV are 0.60 L/min Nebulizer flow rate, 1 ml/min sample flow rate and 4 ml of total sample usage for 4 replicates (1 ml of each replicate).Raw results of Na level can be converted to parts per million (milligrams per liter) using a standard curve (Figure 2).",
    "To make this standard curve, Na standard concentration values in ppm (mg/L) were plotted as the x-axis values and corresponding corrected/normalized Na intensity values (Table 2) were then input as the y-axis values. These data can then be converted to milligrams per kilogram fresh weight using the following equation (1):imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150815/20150815195702_4060.pngData from Na standards are shown in Tables 1-2 and Figure 2. Typical data from this experiment are shown in Tables 3-6 and Figure 3:Table 1, raw Na intensity values obtained from Na standards. Table 2, corrected/normalized Na intensity values of Na standards using the obtained raw Na standard intensity values in the Table 1. Method for correction/normalization is described in the Table 2 ‘Note’.Figure 2, standard curve of corrected/normalized Na intensity values.Table 3, raw data of Na intensity values of the control and 10 min salt treated Arabidopsis samples.Table 4, corrected/normalized Na intensity values obtained from Table 3.Table 5, Na levels in ppm (mg/L) of the control and 10 min salt treated Arabidopsis seedlings. Conversion of Na intensity values to ppm (mg/L) was done using equation 2, which was obtained based on linear regression analysis of the corrected Na standards (Figure 2). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150815/20150815195729_1913.pngTable 6, final conversion of Na levels in Table 5 to ‘mg/kg fresh weight (F.W.)’ using equation 1 (above step 11).Figure 3, comparison of Na level in mg/kg F.W. in the roots of 10 old Arabidopsis seedlings in response to 100 mM salt treatment."
