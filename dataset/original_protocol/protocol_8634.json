    "The experiments were performed in accordance with European directives (86/609/CEE and 2010-63-UE) and French legislation, and were approved by the Paris Descartes University ethics committee.\n1. Spinal Cord Slice Preparation\nPrepare the following solutions daily or one day in advance. If kept overnight, bubble with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 and keep refrigerated in tightly closed bottles.\n\t\nPrepare Low Na + artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF): 3 mM KCl, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 230 mM sucrose, 26 mM NaHCO3, 0.8 mM CaCl2, 8 mM MgCl2, 25 mM glucose, 0.4 mM ascorbic acid, 1 mM Na-kynurenate, 2 mM Na-pyruvate. Bubble with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 (pH 7.4). Since Na-kynurenate is often hard to dissolve, make sure to purchase the one listed in the materials table.\nPrepare K-gluconate solution: 130 mM K-gluconate, 15 mM KCl, 0.05 mM EGTA, 20 mM HEPES, 25 mM glucose, 1 mM Na-kynurenate, 2 mM Na-pyruvate, adjusted to pH 7.4 with KOH.\nPrepare ACSF: 130 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 26 mM NaHCO3, 25 mM glucose, 0.4 mM ascorbic acid, 2 mM Na-pyruvate. Bubble with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 (pH 7.4).\nPrior to the beginning of the dissection, dissolve 2% agar in 80 ml of the K-gluconate solution, and keep warm at 60 °C.\nIntracardiac perfusion\nPerform this preparation on female and male mice, ranging in age from P2 to P11.\nAnesthetize the mouse with an intraperitoneal injection of 0.1 ml of 25 mM pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg).\nUsing needles or tape, immobilize the mouse on its back on a large petri dish filled with silicon. Use a dissecting microscope for the rest of the dissection.",
    "Holding the tip of the sternum, lift the chest and cut the diaphragm using fine scissors. Then open the chest on both sides by cutting through the ribs to expose the heart.\nCut the right atrium before puncturing the left ventricle with a 27G needle.\nPerfuse with ice-cold low Na+ ACSF. After 30 sec, low Na+ ACSF should be seen flowing out of the atrium. Low amounts of sodium prevent the cells from spiking and reduce cellular death during dissection.\nKeep holding the needle in the heart under the dissecting microscope until the liver turns yellow when the blood is drained.\nSpinal cord dissection\nDecapitate the animal and put it on its stomach.\nQuickly remove the skin of the back (Figure 1A1). Make two cuts through the shoulders and going down the chest cage (Figure 1A2). Then cut the cord as low as possible in the caudal section in order to isolate the vertebral column with the beginning of the ribs from the lower part of the animal. Flip the animal again and remove the viscera still attached to the ribs.\nTransfer the vertebral column to another, smaller silicon-filled petri dish and use 4 insect pins to hold it dorsal side up (Figure 1A).\nContinuously perfuse the animal with carbogen-bubbled ACSF (at about 4 °C) while performing a laminectomy of the dorsal side, and exposing the spinal cord from the rostral end (Figure 1B). To do so, insert the tip of fine scissors between the bone and the spinal cord and cut the bone little by little from the rostral end, making sure to stay away from the white matter. Alternate on each side while using tweezers to keep away the band of bone already cut (Figure 1B1).",
    "Using the smallest available spring scissors and tweezers, lift the dura and cut on both sides while holding the loose part of the dura in order to avoid damaging the spinal cord with the scissors. Cut along the rostro-caudal axis.\n\t\tNOTE: The dura is a semi transparent continuous membrane; at this age the pia mater is too fragile and will come apart during the dissection and slicing (Figure 1B2).\nOnce the dura is removed use a blunt glass or plastic tip to gently push the cord on the left side of the groove formed by the half-cut spinal column, and cut the ventral and dorsal roots on the right side, starting from the rostral side, furthest from where they enter the cord (a few mm at least, Figure 1B2).\nRepeat the operation on the left side, always going from rostral to caudal. If left-handed, start from the left side and then move to the right side.\nEmbedding in agar\nSlip the cord out of the vertebral column. Use a smaller insect pin to pin down the cord with the dorsal surface up and delicately remove any piece of membrane still attached to it (Figure 1C1).\nOnce cleaned, trim both ends (Figure 1C2). Insert a bended insect pin in the anterior part of the cord to manipulate the cord and note its orientation (arrow in Figure 1C2). Then transfer the spinal cord to an ice-cold K-gluconate solution. \n\t\tNOTE: This solution mimics the intracellular composition of the CSF and will prevent the cells from dying of osmotic shock once the motoneurons will be cut26.\nOnce the spinal cord is within the intra-cellular solution, take the beaker with the agar out of the dry bath and cool it down on a mixture of ice and water.",
    "Keep stirring while measuring the temperature. When the temperature reaches 38 °C immerse the spinal cord, holding it by the insect pin and place it rostral side down. Make sure the spinal cord is as straight as possible, away from the walls, caudal part slightly upward (Figure 1D1).\nLeave the beaker in the mixture of ice and water to allow the agar to solidify as quickly as possible. Make sure it stays in place and that the cord is as straight as possible (Figure 1D1).\nSlicing\nAfter solidification, cut the agar block containing the spinal cord in such a way that the base of the block is at a 35° angle with the lumbar part of the cord (arrow in Figure 1D2). The dorsal surface should be facing away from the base (Figure 1D2).\n\t\tNOTE: This is a critical step in the procedure, for maintaining the continuity of the motoneuron pools to the ventral roots from which they exit.\nGlue the block into the chamber of the vibratome using cyanoacrylate glue. Immerse it in K-gluconate solution and add slushed frozen K-gluconate solution to maintain the bath chilled (below 2 °C).\nCut 350 - 400 µm thick slices of the lumbar region (identifiable by its curvature and larger diameter). In its proper orientation (see 1.4.1.), use the blade to cut from the dorsal to the ventral surface and make slices continuously more rostral. Typically, there are 4-5 suitable slices with ventral roots extending 2 mm or more. Use the following parameters: 10° angle, 70 Hz vibration frequency and 10 mm/min speed of slicing.\nIncubation\nTransfer the slices to ACSF at 34 °C. After approximately 30 min, cool the slices down to RT and begin the recording session.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54525/54525fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Dissection",

Placing the Slice into the Chamber\nNOTE: Ventral roots are of variable size.\nPrepare a box of various pipettes with tip diameters ranging from 40 to 170 µm in advance. To prepare suction pipettes, prepare many pipettes with a long taper. Using a diamond knife, make a cut at different positions. Then under a dissecting microscope, break it by hitting the tip with tweezers.\nRemove the chamber from the recording microscope and place it under a dissecting microscope.\nSelect a slice that contains a ventral root of sufficient length (2 mm or more) to be mounted on a suction stimulation electrode. Select the proper orientation of the slice with the ventral roots upward (Figure 2A) and delicately cut the agar around the ventral roots while leaving the rest of the agar around the slice (Figure 2B).",
    "NOTE: Because the agar is firmer than the slice, this will allow the threads of the slice's anchor to rest on the agar rather than on the slice and thus the anchor will not damage the tissue. Make sure the threads of the slice's anchor are above the motoneuron pool (shown in red in Figure 2C).\nMount the chamber back onto the microscope and continuously perfuse the recording chamber with ACSF at a rate of 1 - 2 ml/min, at RT. Using a glass pipette filled with ACSF and connected to a syringe, suck one of the ventral root (arrow in Figure 2C). In order to achieve good stimulation of the ventral root, the pipette tip needs to be tight around the ventral root. One pole should be in the stimulating electrode and the other one in the bath (or connected to the patch-clamping electrode reference).\nAchieve patch-clamp recording of the desired cell-type and record the effect of the ventral root stimulation as described previsouly10.\n\t\nHere, use an amplifier for data acquisition. Filter whole-cell recordings at 3 kHz. Digitize at 10 kHz. Compensate bridge resistance in current-clamp mode.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54525/54525fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.
