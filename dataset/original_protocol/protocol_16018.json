    "The following protocol is designed to generate high-quality ribosome profiling data to quantify translation in T. pseudonana CCMP1335. Initially, cells are promptly harvested and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. After mechanical disruption of the cells, optimized RNase digestion conditions are employed to create ribosome-protected footprints. Monosomes are subsequently isolated using sucrose-cushion ultracentrifugation. Alternatively, ribosomes can be purified via sucrose density gradient fractionation as detailed in the Alternate Protocol. This protocol typically yields ∼10 to 50 ng of 26 to 31 nt RNA fragments (corresponding to ∼1 to 5 pmol of RNA), which serves as the optimal amount of starting material for sequencing library preparation. We have incorporated an rRNA removal step via subtractive hybridization with the aim to increase the fraction of informative reads that map to mRNAs.\nMaterials\nThalassiosira pseudonana clone CCMP1335 (Bigelow; see Internet Resources)\nAquil medium (Price et al., 1989[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.843#cpz1843-bib-0034]; see Internet Resources)\nPolysome resuspension buffer (PRB) (see recipe)\nSucrose cushion solution (see recipe)\nQubit RNA BR assay kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, cat. no.

    "Rstudio software (see Internet Resources)\nriboWaltz (see Internet Resources)\nCell growth\n1. Grow T. pseudonana CCMP1335 to mid-exponential phase (5–7 × 105 cells/ml) in Aquil medium under desired experimental conditions.\nT. pseudonana cells are routinely grown in 24 hr light (100-140 μE) at 20°C.\nCell harvest\n2. Collect 2 × 200 ml of culture by gentle vacuum filtration (using a vacuum pump and a reusable bottle top filter) onto a 47-mm filter under a laminar flow hood. Use sterile tweezers to roll up the filter membrane and insert it into a previously labeled 1.5-ml cryogenic vial. Immediately flash-freeze in liquid nitrogen (<1 min).\nTwo replicates of 200 ml culture each are needed per sample to provide enough starting material. Replicates can be pooled again at a later stage of the protocol (step 12). Keep the time between filtration and flash-freezing under 60 s to preserve the translation state of the cell as accurately as possible. Choose a gentle filtration speed to avoid posing another stress factor or breaking of the cells.\nCell lysis\n3. Add 400 µl of pre-chilled polysome resuspension buffer (PRB) to the tube with slightly thawed cells. Rinse off filter and remove with sterile tweezers. Add two scoops of glass beads (425- to 600-µm).\nLysis is done by bead beating of the frozen cell pellets. Prepare enough PRB (at least 1150 µl per tube) for lysis and sucrose cushion (step 10) using a 50-ml centrifuge tube.\n4. Treat sample in bead beater for 2 min (max speed) with a break on ice after 1 min to prevent overheating.\n5. Clarify the lysate by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g, 4°C using a microcentrifuge. Transfer the supernatant using a pipette in a new 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and place on ice.",
    "6. Measure UV absorption at 260 nm of the lysate using a NanoDrop to estimate the RNA concentration.\nNanoDrop measurements only provide a rough estimate of the RNA concentration due to metabolites and light harvesting complexes present in the crude diatom lysate which absorb UV light at 260 nm. If a more precise quantification of the RNA in the lysate is required, use a Qubit Fluorometer and assay tubes with the Qubit RNA BR Assay Kit (note that in this protocol the conditions for RNA digestion have been optimized based on UV absorption measurements).\nRNA digestion\n7. Take ∼60 µg of total RNA and dilute to 300 µl with PRB if necessary. Add 7 U RNase I (100 U/µl) and incubate for 45 min at room temperature with gentle mixing.\n8. Put on ice and add 2 µl SUPERase-In RNase inhibitor (20 U/µl) to stop nuclease digestion.\nRibosome recovery\n9. Transfer the sample to a 11 × 34-mm polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tube.\n10. Underlay sample with 750 µl 1 M sucrose cushion solution by positioning a pipette tip at the bottom of the tube and gently dispensing the sucrose cushion solution.\nThe lysate should float above the sucrose solution, with a visible interface between the layers. Ensure the tubes are balanced prior to centrifugation and add PRB, if necessary.\n11. Pellet ribosomes by centrifugation in an ultracentrifuge using a TLA120.2 rotor, 2 hr at 199,000 × g (75,000 rpm), 4°C.\nWhile pelleted ribosomes are translucent, the pellet may also contain aggregates of the photosystems, which can aid in their identification. As a precaution, prior to removing the tubes from the rotor, it is recommended to mark their outside where the pelleted ribosomes are expected to be located.",
    "12. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 350 µl of TRizol reagent. Transfer to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Replicates of the same sample can be pooled at this point.\n13. Purify resuspended RNA by using the Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep kit following the manufacturer's instruction for purification of total RNA. Elute RNA in 50 µl RNase-free H2O provided with the kit.\n14. Precipitate eluted RNA by adding 10 µl 3 M NaOAc pH 5.5, 1.5 µl GlycoBlue (to facilitate precipitation) and 38.5 µl RNase-free H2O, followed by 150 µl isopropanol.\n15. Carry out precipitation on dry ice >30 min or at −20°C overnight.\n16. Pellet RNA by centrifugation for 30 min at 14,000 × g, 4°C using a microcentrifuge. Pipette all liquid from the tube, place sideways and air dry for 10 min.\n17. Resuspend pellet in 5 µl 10 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8 prepared from the 1 M stock solution.\nSamples can be stored overnight at −20˚C or for several months at −80°C.\nRibosomal footprint fragment purification\nIt is critical to work in an RNase-free environment from this step onwards. Decontaminate the electrophoresis apparatus and other equipment with RNaseZap. MilliQ H2O can be used to prepare the running buffer.\n18. Prepare 15% urea-PAGE gel.\nLarge gels of ∼20 cm × 20 cm × 1 mm are recommended for maximal resolution. If not available, smaller gels can be used.\n19. Pre-heat a heating block to 80°C.\n20. Pre-run gel in the electrophoresis cell at 15 V/cm for 15 min in 1× TBE.",
    "21. Prepare RNA sample from step 17 by adding 5 µl of 2× denaturing sample loading buffer. To prepare marker oligos for two lanes, mix 1 µl lower marker oligo NI-800 (10 µM), 1 µl upper marker oligo NI-801 (10 µM) (see Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.843#cpz1843-tbl-0001]), 10 µl 2× denaturing sample loading buffer and 8 µl 10 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.\n22. Denature sample and marker oligos for 90 s at 80°C using the heat block. Keep on ice until loading.\n23. Load sample onto the gel with marker oligo samples framing the sample lane.\n24. Run gel at 15 V/cm until the lower dye (light blue) front has reached the lower third of the gel.\n25. Stain gel for 5 min with 1× SYBR gold in 1× TBE with gentle shaking.\n26. Visualize gel on a blue light transilluminator and cut out the 26 to 34 nt region of the gel using a scalpel blade (see Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.843#cpz1843-fig-0002]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8e651536-5b7d-4c42-9609-bfb97db9cf36/cpz1843-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2",

Measure concentration using the Qubit microRNA Assay Kit.\nSamples can be stored overnight at −20˚C or for extended periods of time at −80°C.\nLibrary preparation\nFor preparation of sequencing libraries, we followed the protocol by Meindl et al. (2023[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.843#cpz1843-bib-0027]). With this protocol sequencing libraries can be prepared from as little as 0.1 pmol of RNA fragments; an optimal amount of starting material is 1 to 5 pmol of RNA (from step 38). To minimize sample loss, all reactions until PCR amplification of the final library (step 97) should be carried out in low bind reaction tubes.\nWe additionally implemented a subtractive hybridization step for rRNA removal using eight biotinylated depletion oligonucleotides representing abundant rRNA contaminants in T. pseudonana. The custom depletion step was optimized from Zinshteyn et al., and Green (2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.843#cpz1843-bib-0040]).\nRNA dephosphorylation to remove of terminal phosphates\n40.

While the beads are magnetically attracted, incubate the ProNex wash buffer for 30 to 60 s before removal.\nWhen resuspending the samples in the wash buffer, do not remove ProNex beads from the magnet. This can cause up to 20% sample loss. For larger samples, increase the volume of ProNex wash buffer proportionally to the volume of sample and beads.\n103. Repeat the last wash of the magnetically attracted beads with another 300 μl ProNex wash buffer for 40 to 60 s.

(2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.843#cpz1843-bib-0007]). A good starting point for cycle optimization is a range of 6-12 cycles. Ideally, you should observe enough product without overamplification. Overamplification is indicated by the appearance of large assemblies of improperly annealed, partially double-stranded, heteroduplex DNA migrating above the library (known as 'daisy chains', Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.843#cpz1843-fig-0002]; see also Huppertz et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.843#cpz1843-bib-0017]).\n105.

After de-multiplexing, pre-process the sequencing reads by trimming of adapters using Cutadapt (version 2.8, adapter=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCT, overlap=10, minimum-length=10, discard-untrimmed).\n117.
