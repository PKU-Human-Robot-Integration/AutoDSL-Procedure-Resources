The protein in H2O solution should be dialyzed against buffer overnight to remove unwanted additives (e.g., glycerol) before use.\nCritical: The additives (e.g., glycerol) are removed before use. Some additives in buffer will affect lyophilization in step 4.\nMake sure the purity of the protein in H2O solution is >95%.\nNote: Protein purity can be determined by SDS-PAGE with some modifications, or by HPLC or MS as described previously.16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]\nDetermine the concentration of protein in H2O solution as described previously.16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16] Concentrate the protein H2O solution if it is < 3 mg/mL.\nFor sample and buffer lyophilization, aliquots (e.g., 10 tubes, each 60 μL) of proteins or buffers are lyophilized to dryness using the lyophilizer.\nCritical: FT-IR analysis requires high concentration solutions (typically >3 mg/mL in both H2O and D2O) to obtain a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. The protein and buffer solution should be lyophilized together. After freeze-drying, the tube containing lyophilized protein or buffer is sealed immediately with sealing film to prevent H2O in air.\nCritical: Control the freeze-drying temperature, maintain it low enough (e.g., −20°C) during the process to avoid changes in protein characteristics.\nThere are typically two methods for preparing the fully deuterated protein.\nLyophilize aliquots (e.g., 60 μL) of protein in H2O solution at >3 mg/mL to dryness. Reconstitute the lyophilized powder with D2O (e.g., 60 μL) and lyophilize the protein-D2O to dryness again. Reconstitute the protein sample with D2O (e.g., 60 μL) for FT-IR experiments.",
    "Lyophilize aliquots (e.g., 60 μL) of protein in H2O solution at >3 mg/mL to dryness. Reconstitute the lyophilized powder with D2O (e.g., 60 μL), and then incubate the protein-D2O overnight for FT-IR experiments.\nEquipment preparation\nTiming:  < 3 h\nFT-IR spectrometer is put on standby for FT-IR spectra collection.\nTurn on air-conditioning and a liquid desiccant system in the room. Control the temperature at 25°C.\nTurn on the drying equipment for the instrument.\nTurn on the FT-IR source.\nTurn on the FT-IR spectrometer.\nTurn on the computer and monitor, and then start the FT-IR collection program.\nSet the data path of the operating program to store the data.\nCollecting FT-IR spectra for protein\nTiming:  < 5 h\nThe FT-IR spectra are collected as soon as possible under the optimized parameters to obtain the most information on the exchange.\nSet the spectrometer resolution to 4 cm−1.\nSet the spectral range from 4,000 to 500 cm−1.\nSet the number of scans.\nSelect the default paths for each group of files.\nCollect a background spectrum without the IR cell.\nCritical: If the water vapor is not purged completely by dry air, there will be peaks in the region of 1500–1200 cm−1 and 4000–3500 cm−1. If these peaks appear, check the tubing and make sure there is no air leakage, and then purge for a longer period of time as described previously.16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]\nAssembling the CaF2 liquid cell.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3166-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Photographs of the CaF2 liquid cell\nNote: For the demountable transmission CaF2 liquid cell comprising a rectangular window and appropriate spacer (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]), the spacer should be placed between the windows.\nNote: Typically, the path length used for protein characterization in H2O is < 10 μm, usually 6.0 or 7.5 μm.",
    "Note: After the spacer is positioned appropriately, the cell can be reassembled with four machine screws.\nCritical: The spectrum for protein in H2O is obtained in films <10 μm to permit IR radiation passing through the material under observation.\nCritical: Only the demountable transmission cell is recommended for H/D exchange experiments by ensuring the time from sample preparation to acquisition of the first spectrum is < 60 s.\nAddition of H2O buffer or protein in buffer to the cell. After the cell is reassembled, load the cell with solution using a needleless tuberculin syringe through a loading port.\nNote: The solution should be slowly forced or injected into the cell to avoid the formation of air bubbles or unfilled spacers.\nCritical: During filling, ensure that the sample covers the entire window surface without the presence of air bubbles.\nCritical: The spectrum for the H2O solution is acquired before the spectrum for the protein in H2O solution.\nCollect the spectrum of the buffer in H2O.\nClean the cell.\nNote: Usually, the CaF2 cell should be rinsed with water and ethanol and dried by suction using an aspirator or hand-operated vacuum pump.\nCritical: The cell should not be disassembled between the buffer and protein collection.\nFill the cell with protein in H2O solution. Collect a spectrum for the protein in H2O solution.\nNote: Ensure that there are no air bubbles or empty cell areas.\nDo not reassemble the cell. Clean the cell as described in step 20. Repeat step 21 three times.\nDo not reassemble the cell. Clean the cell as described in step 20. Reconstitute the lyophilized buffer with H2O. Fill the cell with reconstituted buffer and collect the spectrum.",
    "Critical: The spectrum for reconstituted buffer is acquired before the spectrum for the reconstituted protein in H2O solution. Do not reassemble the cell. Clean the cell as described in step 20. Reconstitute the lyophilized protein with H2O buffer. Fill the cell with reconstituted protein and collect the spectrum.\nCritical: Reconstituted sample with turbidity cannot be used for the experiment.\nCritical: Reconstitute the lyophilized protein with H2O solution gently to avoid the formation of air bubbles. The protein is viscous and air bubbles can easily form.\nCalculate IR absorbance spectra for the protein in H2O solution and reconstituted protein in H2O solution. Calculate the secondary structure content of protein in H2O solution and reconstituted protein in H2O solution as described previously.16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]\nThere are no significant differences in the α-helix and β-sheet content measured by FT-IR between the protein in H2O and reconstituted protein in H2O buffer.\nIf the secondary structure contents are different, lyophilization causes some changes in the protein. The protein should be lyophilized to a certain volume (e.g., 10 μL) instead of lyophilized to dryness.\nDismantle and then clean the cell.\nNote: Wash the CaF2 window with water and ethyl alcohol (∼1 mL volume), and then with an excess of water (∼10 mL volume). Wipe the windows gently with lens cleaning paper.\nCritical: The CaF2 window should be clean to avoid bubble formation while adding the sample in the following experiment.\nAssemble the CaF2 liquid cell as described in step 17.\nNote: The path length is increased to obtain a higher signal-to-noise ratio for sample in D2O.\nNote: Typically, the path length used for H/D exchange is 50 μm.\nCritical: The demountable transmission cell is recommended for H/D exchange experiments.\nCollection of spectra for D2O buffer solution.",
    "The CaF2 liquid cell is washed with D2O buffer and subsequently dried in order to prevent potential contamination from H2O molecules.\nFor reconstituted protein in H2O solution that has no significant differences with the protein in H2O solution in regards to the secondary structure contents, reconstitute the lyophilized buffer with 99.99% D2O. Fill the cell with reconstituted buffer and collect the spectrum.\nFor reconstituted protein in H2O solution that has significant differences with the protein in H2O solution in regards to the secondary structure contents, mix the protein buffer (e.g., 20 μL) with appropriate D2O buffer (e.g., 80 μL) to obtain a final buffer similar to that present in the protein solution in step 31 (b). Fill the cell with reconstituted buffer and collect the spectrum.\nCritical: The buffer is lyophilized with the related protein similar to that present in the protein D2O solution.\nDismantle and then clean the cell as described in step 24. Assemble the CaF2 liquid cell as described in step 25.\nFor the protein spectrum in D2O, set the spectral range from 4,000 to 500 cm−1.\nNote: The acquisition type is set to Kinetic before data acquisition. When the acquisition type is Kinetic, the gain is recalculated for each sub-file.\nCritical: The software is set before reconstitution of the lyophilized protein.\nSet the initial delay.\nNote: The initial delay is defined as the delay in seconds before any scans are acquired. The initial delay must be longer than the time from reconstituting the lyophilized protein to the acquisition of the first spectrum (<60 s). Typically, the initial delay is set to 60 s.\nSet the number of sub-files, which is the number of sub-files to acquire.",
    "Set the minimum time interval between sub-files, which is defined as the minimum time in seconds between the start of two consecutive sub-files.\nNote: Typically, the spectra need to be recorded at 1-min intervals during the first 10 min; thus, the number of sub-files is set to 10 and the minimum time interval between sub-files is set to 60 s.\nSet the number of scans, which is the number of scans to be averaged together.\nNote: Typically, 8 scans are accumulated between 1 and 10 min.\nCritical: The initial delay is set to 60 s because the majority of the amide protons are exchanged so rapidly that their exchange is completed within 60 s.\nCritical: The total acquisition time for obtaining a spectrum is related to the scan number and the time needed for a single scan. The total acquisition time should be the minimum time interval between sub-files (e.g., <60 s). The total acquisition time for a spectrum = scan number × the time needed for a single scan.\nCritical: The initial delay is set to 60 s because the majority of the amide protons are exchanged so rapidly that their exchange is completed within 60 s.\nCritical: The total acquisition time for all spectra = the total acquisition time for a spectrum + (number of sub-files-1) × minimum time interval. Typically, the total acquisition time should be < 10–15 min.\nSet the initial delay. The initial delay is defined as the delay in seconds before any scans are acquired.\nNote: The initial delay must be longer than the time from reconstituting the lyophilized protein to the acquisition of the first spectrum (<60 s).",
    "For reconstituted protein in H2O solution that has no significant differences with the protein in H2O solution in regard to the secondary structure contents, reconstitute the lyophilized protein in D2O solution. The volume of protein before lyophilization should be the same as the volume after reconstitution.\nCritical: The lyophilized protein must be suspended gently to avoid the generation of bubbles in the sample.\nFor reconstituted protein in H2O solution that has significant differences with the protein in H2O solution in regard to the secondary structure contents, mix the protein solution (e.g., 20 μL) in step 23(b) with an appropriate volume of D2O (e.g., 90 μL) to obtain a final protein concentration >3 mg/mL for the H/D exchange experiment.\nCritical: The recommended fraction of D2O to H2O is 80:20. Inject the sample into the cell and put the cell on the holder. All procedures must be completed during the initial delay (60 s).\nCritical: Ensure that the sample fills the entire window surface without the presence of bubbles or empty cell areas.\nCritical: The time from the reconstitution of lyophilized protein to acquisition of the first spectrum is within the time frame of the initial delay.\nRecord and save the spectra.\nSet the initial delay before the next group of sub-files is acquired.\nSet the number of scans (e.g., 16 or 32). Set the minimum time interval between sub-files (e.g., 300 s).\nSet the number of sub-files (e.g., 10).\nCritical: The number of scans, the minimum time interval, and number of sub-files should be set based on the progression of the experiment and the protein dynamics. With progression of the H/D exchange experiment, the minimum time interval between sub-files will be longer and the spectra can be recorded with more scans.",
    "Start the collection of the spectrum. The spectra are recorded and saved.\nSet the initial time delay before the next group of sub-files is acquired.\nSet the number of scans (e.g., 64 or 128). Set the minimum time interval between sub-files (e.g., 600 s).\nSet the number of sub-files (e.g., 10). The minimum time interval between sub-files will be longer and the spectra require more scans than the last group of spectra.\nStart collection of the spectrum.\nCritical: The kinetic spectra are recorded until the protein is nearly fully deuterated.\nFor the spectrum of the fully deuterated protein, collect the spectrum of the sample prepared at step 5 in Normal mode.\nPause point: The data collection can end here. Demount the liquid cell by removing the four machine screws. Wash the CaF2 window with ethyl alcohol and then an excess of water. Finally, wipe the windows gently with lens cleaning paper.\nData analysis\nTiming: 1 h\nThe exchange kinetics parameters are fitted using equations to assess the overall protein dynamics.\nCalculate the IR absorbance spectra.\nNote: After completing all measurements, the software (BOMEN GRAMS/32) is used to compute the absorbance spectra. After the computations are done, the results should be saved immediately.\nSubtract the reference spectra from the spectra for protein in H2O solution.\nNote: Subtract the reference spectra from the protein spectra to remove the water contribution using a double subtraction procedure.\nCritical: To determine whether the subtraction of absorption bands due to liquid water and gaseous water in the atmosphere has been successful, a straight baseline between 2000–1750 cm−1 can be used as a criterion.\nPerform the baseline correction as described by Yang et al.16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]\nSelect the regions of interest (1800–1500 cm−1).",
    "Note: The regions of interest in this study include amide I and amide II. The spectral region of 2000 to 1300 cm−1 is obtained for protein in H2O.\nCritical: To obtain high-quality bacterial IR spectra, the background spectrum must be carefully and adequately subtracted from the sample spectrum. Most IR instruments are equipped with software that can subtract background spectra automatically. Ensure the background spectrum is correctly set.\nThe type of H/D exchange data acquisition is Kinetic mode and the data is saved as multifiles.\nNote: A multifile is simply a file with more than one trace (sub-file).\nNote: Multifiles should be split into single files. Select untifiles→multifile utilities→split into singles→New file name→Enter NEW base name for single file→subfile number from the Application menu. The sub-files are saved as new single files ranging from the first sub-file number to the last sub-file number.\nSubtract the reference spectra from the protein spectra to remove the D2O contribution using the double-subtraction procedure described in step 33.\nPerform the baseline correction.\nSelect the regions of interest (1800–1500 cm−1).\nFor comparison, the amide I band maximum for protein in H2O is normalized to the amide I band maximum for protein in D2O (×AI/AI(H2O)).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3166-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

The value of AI/AII will affect the relative fraction of unexchanged amide proton (F). As shown in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A, the AI/AII ratio is 1.03 (a protein FT-IR absorbance spectrum in H2O) and 1.52 (another protein FT-IR absorbance spectrum in H2O).
