    "1)  Select suppressor mutants from the 31019b yeast strain<sup>\\(1)</sup> carrying the high copy number plasmid pDR-AtAMT1;1Thr460Ala by growing at 28&#xBA;C for 8 days on solid YNB medium supplemented with 3% glucose and 2 mM ammonium chloride. \n2)  Pick suppressors and amplify in liquid YNB medium supplemented with 3% glucose and 2 mM ammonium. \n3)  Isolate plasmid from yeast by CTAB extraction and use for _E. coli_ transformation. \n4)  Amplify plasmids in _E. coli_, isolate and sequence."
