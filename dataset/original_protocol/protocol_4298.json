    "Following Protocol B from the manufacturer’s manual and described the details below:    Prepare cell lysates   Amount of adherent cells needed for this assay are approximately 3 x 105 or 70 - 80% confluent cells per experimental sample in one well of 12 well plate.   Add 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X 100 to Component C assay buffer.   After induction of TACE activation with treatment of choice, remove media; wash cells with PBS; lift cells, collect into 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, and lyse with 200 µl Component C assay buffer. (The amount of assay buffer needs to be determined empirically for the experimental samples used.)   Incubate the cell suspension at 4 °C for 10 min on unidirectional rotator.   Centrifuge the lysed cells at 2,500 x g at 4 °C.   Collect supernatant containing protein sample into a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.     Prepare working solutions Note: All kit components should be thawed to room temperature before starting the experiment. Protect light sensitive materials from exposure to ambient light. For TACE substrate solution, dilute TACE substrate (Component A) 1:100 in assay buffer (Component C). Note: For each experiment, prepare fresh substrate solution.   Set up TACE enzymatic reaction   Set up at least triplicate enzymatic reactions.   Add 50 µl of protein sample (supernatant collected in step 1f) into black 96 well plate.   Set up a 50 µl blank control containing assay buffer (Component C) only. The blank control well fluorescence reading accounts for the background fluorescence contributed by the assay buffer. In this case, the blank control functions as the reagent blank consisting only of the assay buffer used to lyse the cells; in general, the absorbance reading for this solution is typically subtracted from each sample absorbance reading in order to only consider the substance you are trying to analyze or measure.",
    "In the dark, set up a 50 µl positive control with the 5-FAM fluorescence reference standard: Dilute 1 mM 5-FAM (Component B) to 4 μM in assay buffer (Component C). Do 2-fold serial dilutions to get concentrations of 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.12, and 0.06 μM, include an assay buffer blank. Add 50 μl per well of these serially diluted 5-FAM reference solutions. Protect tubes and plate from ambient light.   On lab bench, pre-incubate the plate for 10 min at room temperature protected from ambient light.     Measure TACE activity Use TACE substrate solution equilibrated to room temperature. Add 50 µl of TACE substrate solution into each well (each well now contains a total volume of 100 µl). Mix reagents in plate by gently shaking by hand for 30 sec. Immediately quantify TACE enzymatic activity by measuring fluorescence intensity at Ex/Em=485 nm/538 nm.    Detect protein concentration Use a protein quantification method, such as the Bradford assay, to measure total protein concentration in each experimental sample from the cell lysates prepared in steps 1c-f (He, 2011).   Data analysis The blank control well fluorescence reading accounts for the background fluorescence contributed by the assay buffer. Subtract the background fluorescence reading of the blank from each sample in order to only consider the TACE activity measured. Normalize the relative fluorescence units (RFU) of each experimental sample to its total protein concentration. Plot the data as TACE activity RFU/ µg protein as shown in Figure 1.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20141014/20141014002008_3884.jpg Figure 1.
