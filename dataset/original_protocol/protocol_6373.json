    "Coating the coverslipsWash, dry and sterilize the coverslips by autoclaving and/or ethanol treatment (95% to absolute ethanol) prior to coating.Incubate the dried, sterile coverslips with PLL (0.1 mg/ml, final concentration in PBS) for 30 min, followed by rinsing twice for 30 s with PBS to prevent the toxicity associated with excess PLL.Let the coverslips dry completely before use. We recommend using freshly coated coverslips. Alternatively, the pre-coated coverslips can be stored at 4 °C for up to 3 weeks.Dissection of neonatal spinal cordsPrepare ice-cold dissection medium (see Recipes).Carefully anesthetize the pups. Wipe the body with 70% ethanol and swiftly decapitate with the help of a scalpel.Make an incision in the lower back and expose the vertebral column. The skin and vertebral column tissue of the neonatal rats are soft and can be dissected out with relative ease when compared to the adults.With the help of spring scissors and fine forceps, carefully cut open the vertebral column to expose the spinal cord, moving from the caudal to rostral end. Gently but swiftly remove the spinal cord and place it into ice-cold dissection medium. For a description of the dissection process, we recommend the protocol previously published by Gal et al. (2016).Thoroughly separate the meninges from the spinal cords using the tips of fine forceps and minimizing tissue damage. With the help of a scalpel, cut the tissue into small pieces and proceed with trituration in a Laminar Air Flow hood (LAF).Mixed glial culturesTransfer the tissue to 1 ml of the dissociation medium per spinal cord, at 37 °C for 15 min. Trypsin helps in dissociation of the tissue while addition of DNase aids by digesting the viscous DNA released from the damaged cells.",
    "Stop the reaction by adding pre-warmed growth media (DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS-HI) and centrifuge at 400 x g for 3 min.Replace the supernatant with growth media, and mechanically triturate by passing through 1 ml fire polished glass pipette 8-10 times gently. Care should be taken to avoid bubbles. Allow the undissociated tissue to settle down and transfer the supernatant to another vial. Add fresh media and repeat the process of mechanical trituration 2 more times or till the tissue is dissociated. The optimal shear stress causes the tissues to dislodge into a single-cell suspension. However, harsh trituration may lead to loss of yield due to cell death.Pellet down the single-cell suspension thus obtained at 400 x g for 3 min.Resuspend in fresh media.Count the cells using a hemocytometer and plate with a seeding density of 2.5 x 104 cells/ml in T-25 tissue culture flask. Incubate at 37 °C in a sterile cell culture incubator with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity.Note: Coating the flasks with PLL prior to seeding is not necessary, as glial cells adhere robustly. In our experience, seeding on uncoated flasks further ensured enrichment. Change the media every day for 3-4 days to ensure the proper removal of residual debris. Afterward, replenish the media as per the requirement. By day in vitro (DIV) 7, the cultures start attaining confluence, and by DIV 12, a population of microglia with fringent, phase-bright soma can be seen growing on the top of astrocytes (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200109/20200109214832_5272.jpgFigure 1. Mixed glial cultures isolated from the rat spinal cord. A and A’ represent the growing (DIV 7) and confluent (DIV 12) cultures, respectively. Panel B depicts the presence of distinct microglial marker, Iba-1 positive cells growing on top of the astroglial marker, GFAP labeled cells. Scale bars are indicated.",
    "Astroglial culturesEstablish and allow the mixed cultures to attain confluence (8-10 DIV). Replace the media every alternate day. On the 11th DIV, place the culture flasks on an orbital shaker at 200 rpm for 3-4 h maintained at 37 °C. Aspirate the resultant media that contains the less adherent microglial cells dislodged from the top of astrocytes.The media containing microglial cells obtained at this stage can be further centrifuged at 400 x g for 3 min to pellet microglia. This microglial population can be resuspended in DMEM/F-12 and plated for future experiments in appropriate culture dishes with the desired plating density. However, care must be taken to avoid the dislodged non-microglial cells, including astrocytes, as it can easily lead to cross-contamination. Moreover, we adopted another, more efficient method to culture microglia (Saura et al., 2003), that provided better yield and reduced contamination, as described later.Thoroughly wash the intact astroglial layer with PBS, followed by incubation in 0.25% trypsin-EDTA for 1-2 min, to ensure proper detachment of the cells.Monitor the rounding of cells and stop the trypsinization with an equal amount of growth media when the detachment is complete.Pellet the cells at 400 x g for 3 min and resuspend in fresh growth media. Replate at a density of 2.5 x 104 cells/ml on the circular coverslips in a 24-well plate and proceed with the experiments (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200109/20200109214847_5347.jpgFigure 2. Enriched astroglial cultures derived from the mixed cultures. A, A’, C, C’. The cultures mainly consist of a flat/protoplasmic morphology. B, D-E’. Fibrous morphology can be seen occasionally in unstimulated cultures but frequently in cultures provided with inflammatory stimulus. B, B’. Astrocytes further subcultured (20-25 DIV) do not show a significant change in their viability or reactive ability.",
    "The cultures stain negative for microglia as shown by Iba-1 staining (F-F”) and neurons, as shown by ChAT staining (G-G”). Scale bars are indicated.Microglial culturesDerive the mixed glial cultures from the Wistar rat pups as described above and proceed for establishing microglial cultures using mild trypsinization method.After the cultures reach confluence, allow the cultures to mature for a few more days while constantly replenishing one-half of the media with fresh medium every alternate day. Don’t completely remove the old media conditioned with glial factors, as these factors allow for the optimal growth of microglia.After the intact astroglial monolayer has matured for a while, subject the glial cultures to mild trypsin-EDTA treatment. Add 4-6 ml of Trypsin EDTA-DMEM/F-12, in a ratio of 1:4 per flask, enough to cover the cells. The mild trypsinization step removes the astroglial monolayer, revealing the microglial layer growing beneath, while DMEM/F-12 provides nourishment throughout the process. The process usually takes 10-15 min. Periodically check for the detachment of the monolayer under a phase contrast microscope and standardize the time for optimal detachment.Once the astroglial layer is fully detached, discard the media containing the astroglial layer and wash the culture dish thoroughly with DMEM/F-12 to remove traces of non-microglial cells.Check the cultures for purity. Afterward, use the cells directly, or replate on the circular coverslips in a 24-well plate, or as per the requirement of the experiment (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200109/20200109214904_0586.jpgFigure 3. Enriched microglial cultures derived from the mixed cultures. A-A’’, B-B’’. Healthy cultures predominantly display process bearing morphology in the unstimulated state. However, intermediate (A’’’, B’’’) and reactive, phagocytotic (A’’’’, B’’’’) stages can be observed as the microglial response to external stimuli. The cultures stain negative for astroglial contamination (C-C’’). Scale bars are indicated.",
    "Fixation and immunostainingWash the coverslips containing cells with sterile PBS and follow with fixation using 4% PFA for 15 min at RT. Aspirate PFA and thoroughly wash with PBS before proceeding for immunostaining.Antigen retrieval step is optional and should be standardized depending upon the guidelines for each antibody. For the antibodies used in the present study, antigen retrieval was neither needed nor performed.Proceed for blocking with 3% BSA for an hour, followed by the overnight incubation at 4 °C with the primary antibody of interest. After primary incubation, subject the coverslips to 3 washes of 5 min each before adding appropriate, fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies. After incubation for 2 h at RT, wash the coverslips with PBS thrice for 5 min each and mount them on a clean slide with PVA-DABCO anti-fade mounting medium. Once the slide has dried completely, proceed for imaging with a confocal microscope."
