    "The MHC II–EGFP knock-in mouse model provides a valuable platform for the in vivo characterization of antigen presentation phenomena, ranging from the molecular to whole-animal levels. Recent advancements in imaging techniques, combined with genetically engineered organismal models expressing fluorescent proteins, have revolutionized multiple disciplines in experimental biology. These developments have paved the way for rewriting textbooks and uncovering new phenomena, including the antigen-specific tubulation of the MHC II loading compartment in dendritic cells (DCs) toward the immunological synapse.\nDCs are essential regulators of immune reactions and belong to the category of professional APCs. They have a unique ability to integrate danger and “stranger” molecular patterns. DC-mediated T cell activation is a pivotal event in the activation of immune reactivity. The MHC II–EGFP knock-in mouse serves as a suitable source of DCs, collected either directly as primary cells from relevant tissues or through differentiation from hematopoietic stem cells, such as those derived from the bone marrow. These cells can be loaded with a model antigen (e.g., ovalbumin) to examine their interaction with cognate T cells expressing the appropriate antigen-specific T cell receptor (OT II).\nThe high resolution of live-cell imaging microscopy provides us with the ability to not only perform long-term imaging of cell-to-cell interactions without causing significant photodamage, using routine methodologies such as spinning-disc technology, but also study immunological synapse formation and characterize fluorescently labeled MHC II loading compartment under various conditions. By acquiring multiple videomicroscopy datasets depicting diverse antigen-presentation scenarios (e.g., different types of material presented via MHC II and cognate T cell receptor specificity, the activation status of interacting cells, molecules interfering with the process), we can accurately quantify endosomal tubulation toward the immune synapse, including measuring tubule length and directionality.",
    "Combining the MHC II–EGFP knock-in mouse model with advanced imaging techniques offers a powerful approach to investigating antigen presentation dynamics and uncovering intricate details of cellular interactions within the immune system. This knowledge fosters the development of immunological theory, with broader implications for understanding immune responses and designing targeted therapeutic strategies.\nMaterials\nMice: MHC II–EGFP knock-in mice (8 weeks old, males and females, bred in house)\nD-PBS/2.5% FBS (see recipe)\nRBC Lysis Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no.

    "Because readouts are fluorescence based (i.e., confocal microscopy, flow cytometry) and not feasible using non-fluorescently labeled cells, control mice are usually not included in experiments for the characterization of the MHC II antigen-specific vesicular trafficking. Control experiments comparing the typical (physiological) behavior of class II MHC–EGFP molecules have been published (Boes et al., 2002[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.925#cpz1925-bib-0003]).\n2. Working under sterile conditions, dissect the femurs and tibia using scissors and forceps, and cut the epiphyses out using scissors and opening the diaphysis.\n3. Using a needle and syringe with 0.5 ml D-PBS/2.5% FBS, flush cells out from the femur and tibia diaphysis marrow cavity into a 40-μm nylon cell strainer placed in a 50-ml conical Falcon tube to remove tissue debris.\n4. Remove erythrocytes by osmotic shock by adding 10 ml RBC Lysis Buffer per milliliter of cellular suspension and incubating for 10-15 min at room temperature. Centrifuge 5 min at 500 × g, room temperature, and resuspend the pellet in the appropriate volume of DMEM culture medium (phenol-red-free DMEM/10% FBS with 25 mM HEPES, 10 ng/ml GM-CSF, and 1 ng/ml IL-4).\n5. Plate cells at a density of 1 × 106 cells (quantified first using a Bürker counting chamber) per well of a 6-well plate in 2 ml of the same DMEM culture medium.\n6. Carefully insert a sterilized 25-mm circular coverslip into each well using forceps in the incubator (37°C, 5% CO2) and incubate for 5 days, changing the medium every second day (that is, on days 3 and 5).\n7. On day 2, remove non-adherent cells by gently washing, and replace half of the medium.\n8. If activated APCs are of interest, activate the cells by adding 10 μg of 5 μg/ml LPS to corresponding wells of the 6-well plate on day 4 for the last 20 h of culture.",
    "Antigen presentation in real time\n9. Culture dendritic cells to a concentration of 1 × 106 cell/well in a 6-well culture plate with one 25-mm circular glass coverslip in each well, as described in steps 1-7, but using 2 ml/well DMEM culture medium supplemented with 300 μM OVA.\nThis step is performed to induce the presentation of antigen-derived peptides on class II molecules. Cell concentration is determined by counting cells using a Bürker counting chamber.\n10. Wash DCs three times with DMEM culture medium (without OVA), each time by gently removing ∼90% DMEM medium and washing using 2 ml medium.\nAlternatively, DCs can be isolated by positive sorting using the MACS apparatus and anti-CD11c antibody according to the manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotec) to achieve a purity of >95% CD11c+ DCs.\n11. Sacrifice one male or female 8-week-old OTII mouse (as ordered from Charles River Laboratories) by cervical dislocation.\n12. Acquire the OVA-specific OT II T cells from the lymph nodes of the OT II mouse: dissect lymph nodes, e.g., subiliac lymph nodes, using scissors and forceps, prepare a cell suspension by crushing the lymph nodes between two frost microscopy slides and resuspending the cells into DMEM, and quantify them using a Bürker counting chamber.\nIn OTII mice, CD4 T cells account for 25% of all cells purified from spleen and/or lymph nodes using a T cell purification kit, resulting in a >95% pure T cell population).\n13. Label OVA-specific T cells (0.5 × 106) isolated and pooled from different lymph nodes by adding Hoechst 33258 to 2 µg/ml and return to the CO2 incubator for 30 min. Next, wash the cells three times with phenol-red-free RPMI 1640, each time by gently removing ∼90% of the medium, adding 2 ml medium, resuspending, and centrifuging for 5 min at 300 × g.",
    "14. Add the 1-ml aliquots of OT II T cell suspensions to each well of the 6-well plate from step 9 (containing DCs growing on 25-mm circular glass coverslips) and quickly centrifuge at 600 × g, room temperature, to bring the cells into contact with each other.\n15. Transfer the 25-mm circular glass coverslips into the temperature-controlled open perfusion chamber.\n16. Maintain cells in phenol-red-free DMEM medium with 25 mM HEPES and 10% FBS at 37°C in a temperature-controlled open perfusion chamber or use similar equipment compatible with your microscopic setup.\n17. Perform videomicroscopy analysis immediately and after 2 and 6 hr. Imaging can be performed using an inverted Zeiss 200M microscope equipped with a × 63 objective (1.4-NA PlanApo) and a spinning-disc confocal head or any other suitable imaging system for long-term videomicroscopy.\n18. Use Slidebook for image acquisition and data processing, or choose other software solutions.\nThe analyzed images could contain conjugates between dendritic cells (MHC II clearly intracellularly positive in the endosomal/MHC II loading compartment) and T cells (positive for Hoechst 33258 signal). The optimal imaging setup is a combination of brightfield (demarcation of the cellular shapes, EGFP fluorescence, in green) and Hoechst 33258 fluorescence (blue); typical examples are provuded in Figure 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.925#cpz1925-fig-0005] of Boes et al. (2002[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.925#cpz1925-bib-0003]).\n19. Score of DC phenotypes on the acquired datasets for the ability to induce tubulation within 2 hr of addition of OTII T cells. At least 100 DCs should be analyzed independently, by two unbiased individuals, for the induction of tubulation (Bertho et al., 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.925#cpz1925-bib-0002]).\nThe characteristics evaluated there are the length of all the MHC II positive tubules and their directionality towards the immunological synapse—examples of scoring are provided in Figure 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.925#cpz1925-fig-0005] of Boes et al.

    "The MHC II–EGFP knock-in mouse model offers a unique tool for comparing the overall MHC II expression (based on EGFP fluorescence intensity) with the surface expression, which can reflect the differentiation or activation status of a particular cell population. The combination of the endogenous fluorescent tag with surface antibody-based labeling is compatible with in vivo conditions; the only alternative for overall MHC II expression quantification consists of cell fixation and permeabilization protocols. In this protocol we introduce a straightforward tool for identifying the overall versus surface MHC II expression in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs). Our model enables a user to omit the steps of multiple staining with fluorophore-tagged antibodies, including the fixation and permeabilization steps, which are needed to identify intracellular markers for flow cytometry. This protocol enables further staining with other extracellular markers without compromising fluorescence performance, as may occur through fixation.\nMaterials\nMice: 8-week-old MHC II–EGFP knock-in (kindly provided by Marianne Boes, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands) and 8-week-old C57BL/6 female mice (Charles River Laboratories)\n3% FBS RPMI (see recipe), ice cold\n10 mg/ml collagenase D (see recipe)\n0.5 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid calcium disodium salt hydrate (EDTA; Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 23411-34-9)\n1000×-diluted Fc block solution (see recipe)\nCell staining buffer (see recipe)\nAPC/Fire™ 750 anti-mouse CD45 antibody (clone 30-F11, cat. no. 103154, Biolegend; see recipe)\nAPC anti-mouse CD19 antibody (clone 6D5, cat. no. 115512, Biolegend; see recipe)\nPE-Cy™7 hamster anti-mouse CD11c (clone HL3; cat. no. 558079, BD Bioscience; see recipe)\nMHC II single-stain control (APC/cyanine 7 [APC-Cy7] anti-mouse I-A/I-E antibody, clone M5/114.15.2, cat. no. 107628, Biolegend; see recipe)\nDistilled H2O\n1× PBS (see recipe)\n200× Sytox Blue (see recipe)\nDissecting instruments (scissors, forceps)\nZeiss SteREO Lumar V12 stereomicroscope (objective: Zeiss ApoLumar S 1.2×, FWD 47 mm)\n1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes (Biologix, cat. no. 80-1500)",

For correct statistical analysis, it is advisable to use six mice of each genotype as an experimental animal dataset.\n2. Under the fluorescence stereomicroscope, carefully remove the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), and quickly transfer them into a small petri dish filled with 1× PBS.\n3. On a petri dish, separate the individual nodules. Strip them of any residual adipose tissue (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.925#cpz1925-prot-0003]).\n4. Transfer the individual MLNs into 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes containing 360 μl of 3% FBS RPMI, keeping them on ice.\n5. Cut individual MLNs into small pieces with scissors.\n6. Add 40 μl of 10 mg/ml collagenase solution and incubate the tubes at 37°C in the thermoblock (550 rpm) for 40 min.\n7. Add 600 μl of 3% FBS RPMI to each sample.\n8. Add 4 μl of 0.5 M EDTA to each sample, mix thoroughly, and then pipet the mixture through a cell strainer into a clean microcentrifuge tube.\nEDTA stops the enzyme activity.\n9.

Also prepare samples for single-stain controls for CD45, MHC II, CD19, and CD11c, as well as unstained MHC II–EGFP control and wild-type (C57BL/6 mouse) control.\nFor the CD45 single-stain control, add 0.3 μl APC/Fire™ 750 anti-mouse CD45 antibody to the 60 μl of cell staining buffer (to 1 μg/ml final).\nFor the CD11c single-stain control, add 0.4 μl PE-Cy™7 hamster anti-mouse CD11c to the 60 μl of cell of staining buffer (to 1.33 μg/ml final).\nFor the CD19 single-stain control, add 1.5 μl APC anti-mouse CD19 antibody to the 60 μl of cell staining buffer (to 5 μg/ml final).\nFor the MHC II single-stain control, use pre-prepared 1000×-diluted APC-Cy7 anti-mouse I-A/I-E antibody as the staining buffer (to 0.2 μg/ml final); this avoids inaccuracy caused by adding too small amount of antibody.\n14. Using 50 of antibody mix per node, stain the samples with the respective antibodies (single-stain controls + antibody mix) for 25 min, on ice, in the dark.\n15.

    "The MHC II–EGFP knock-in mouse model provides us with a valuable tool for accurately identifying lymphoid organs, which typically contain MHC-II-expressing cells. These cells play a key role in local immune regulation via antigen presentation of exogenous or autophagy-derived antigens. However, lymphoid organs in mouse models are relatively small, often embedded within the surrounding tissue, and difficult to distinguish by the naked eye. Therefore, the precise identification and excision of these specific tissues are crucial for further processing, analysis, and data interpretation. Quantitative analysis requires extracting the entire lymphoid structure and identifying all relevant anatomical components. Simultaneously, flow cytometry and light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) require completely removing adipose tissue residues. The MHC II–EGFP knock-in mouse model leverages the contrast between the fluorescence signal and background autofluorescence, making it possible to clearly identify all lymphoid tissues under a fluorescence stereomicroscope and to excise them precisely from surrounding tissue (Pačes et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.925#cpz1925-bib-0019]).\nPrevious anatomic research has identified a total of 22 lymphatic nodes in the mouse body (Van den Broeck et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.925#cpz1925-bib-0022]). By direct fluorescence labeling, we can efficiently and precisely identify all these lymph nodes. Additionally, this protocol provides detailed instructions for identifying and excising individual Peyer's patches (PPs) and for isolating the mesenteric lymph node (MLN) complex into separate nodes, which are responsible for draining specific segments of the intestine.\nIn this protocol, we introduce a tool for identifying lymphoid organs, making it possible to prepare the entire set for individual characterization using various techniques such as flow cytometry, histology, and whole-mount microscopy. This approach serves as a valuable method for comprehensive, quantitative immunological studies, particularly when simultaneously phenotyping the entire lymphoid system. With this protocol, researchers can accurately identify and analyze lymphoid organs, thereby gaining a deeper understanding of their structure, function, and immunological significance.\nMaterials",

    "The MHC II–EGFP knock-in mouse model enables us to directly visualize antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and to accurately quantify individual lymphoid cell accumulations. This approach can thus be used not to study cell morphology but also to perform surface measurements without additional processing steps such as fixation, cutting, or staining. Avoiding these procedures mitigates a wide range of artifacts. However, the morphology of the immune tissue in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) undergoes developmental changes, showing variations between individuals and mouse models (Gama et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.925#cpz1925-bib-0008]). Additionally, the size and number of individual structures are affected by interactions with the microbiota (Kernbauer et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.925#cpz1925-bib-0015]). These differences have only been sporadically studied even though the GIT immune system is quantitatively and functionally significant within the broader immune system. In this study, we present a methodological toolbox for quantifying the lymphoid tissue in the GIT, which reflects the hierarchical organization of the GIT, including the lamina propria, scattered intestinal lymphoid tissue, and Peyer's patches. This toolbox serves as a quick and straightforward experimental approach for phenotyping the entire lymphoid structures relevant to the mouse GIT and considers various factors such as development, sex, individual variability, infection, microbiota imbalance/modification, and genetics, including transgenic technologies. A notable advantage is the enhanced fluorescence observed in the lamina propria within individual villi, which enables a precise ex vivo quantification in situ without requiring standard histological methodologies prone to artifacts. By employing this methodological toolbox, researchers can gain deeper insights into the organization and tuning of the gastrointestinal immune system, which in turn has significant implications for understanding systemic immune responses.\nMaterials\nMice: 8-week-old MHC II–EGFP knock-in mice (kindly provided by Marianne Boes, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, the Netherlands)\n1× PBS (see recipe)\nStraight-tip precision tweezers (P-LAB)\nOphthalmology scissors (MEDIN)\nPetri dishes\n1000-µl micropipet",

    "Despite significant advancements in the field of quantitative immunology, the availability of quantitative data on physiological functions, particularly on immune cells, remains limited. For this reason, researchers often rely on relative data, analyzed and interpreted disregarding the broader context of the entire system. This lack of detailed quantitative studies is surprising given that even minor variations in cell counts or population proportions can have profound functional implications. Comprehensive quantitative research on specific immune cell populations must be thus conducted under both physiological and pathological conditions. For this purpose, quantitative systems immunological approaches are essential as they enable us to calculate exact and semi-exact values, which are imperative for accurate data interpretation. Light-sheet microscopy offers an unparalleled opportunity for studying whole cleared organs in situ, applying unique microscopic methods. These methods are particularly advantageous when using the MHC II–EGFP model, which exploits the bright and relatively photostable localization of endogenous MHC II expression through the EGFP tag. By leveraging such quantitative immunological approaches and innovative imaging techniques, researchers can gain unprecedented insights into the dynamics and functionality of the entire immune system, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of immune responses and their implications in various physiological and pathological contexts.\nMaterials\nMice: 8-week-old MHC II–EGFP knock-in mice (kindly provided by Marianne Boes, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands)\n1× PBS (see recipe)\nParaformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 158127)\nCUBIC 1 clearing solution (see recipe)\nCUBIC wash solution (see recipe)\nDRAQ5 Fluorescent Probe Solution (5 mM; Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 62251)\nSodium azide (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no.

Apart from its nutritional value, maternal milk serves as a vital source of diverse bioactive factors, including immune cells (Witkowska-Zimny & Kaminska-El-Hassan, 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.925#cpz1925-bib-0025]; Laouar, 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.925#cpz1925-bib-0017]). Accurately and consistently characterizing the cellular composition of mouse milk requires using appropriate cell isolation techniques followed by cell staining and a precise analysis. However, mouse milk contains various components, such as fat globules, lipid droplets, and debris, that may prevent an accurate quantitative analysis of the cell content. With previous standard protocols, researchers have struggled to differentiate cellular from noncellular components. In this protocol, milk collection is performed under standard conditions without administering oxytocin, ensuring minimal impact on the physiological parameters of dams (Muranishi et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.925#cpz1925-bib-0018]).

    "Compensation controls, also known as single-stain controls, play a key role in multicolor flow cytometry experiments. These controls are essential for accurately and precisely setting compensation values, particularly when measuring challenging samples such as milk, with high autofluorescence and nonspecific binding to oil droplets. The levels of compensation are commonly determined using splenocytes (spleen mononuclear cells, SMC) derived from the spleen for their complex cellular composition, encompassing various cell types at different activation or developmental stages. The cellular suspension derived from the spleen provides an excellent platform for optimizing the necessary compensation values. Moreover, the spleen is abundant in MHC II+ cells and, as such, ideal for achieving a precise compensation of spectral cross-talks with EGFP. By carefully setting the parameters for cell cytometry using the splenocyte suspension, researchers can ensure an accurate compensation and reliable interpretation of flow cytometry data.\nMaterials\nMice: 8-week-old MHC II–EGFP knock-in (kindly provided by Marianne Boes, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands) and 8-week-old C57BL/6 female mice (Charles River Laboratories)\nRPMI 1640 medium supplemented with L-glutamine and phenol red (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 21875034), ice cold\nRPMI 1640/10% FBS (see recipe)\nCell staining buffer (see recipe)\n500×-diluted Fc block solution (see recipe)\nSingle-stain controls (CD45, DRAQ5) for compensation (see recipes)\nAPC/Fire™ 750 anti-mouse CD45 antibody (clone 30-F11, cat. no. 103154, Biolegend)\nDRAQ5™ Fluorescent Probe Solution (5 mM; Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 62251)\nDissecting instruments (scissors, forceps)\n1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes (Biologix, cat. no. 80-1500)\n2.5-, 20-, 200-, and 1000-µl mechanical pipets\n50-ml conical centrifuge tubes (Jet Biofil, CFT-011-500)\nCell strainer, 40-µm pore size (VWR, cat. no. 734-2760)\nPlunger from Inject Luer Solo, 2 ml (B.
