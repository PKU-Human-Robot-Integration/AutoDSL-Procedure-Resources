    "1. Preparation of reagents for mPSC culture\nPrepare N2 supplement.\n\t\nIn non-sterile conditions, prepare the following stock solutions (step 1.1.1.1) in a chemical safety fume hood. Add the solid powder of each chemical to a pre-weighed 50 mL conical tube. Weigh each tube after adding the powder and add an appropriate amount of solvent to achieve the concentrations below. For one batch of media, prepare the minimum amount listed.\n\t\tNOTE: The following reagents are hazardous and should be handled in accordance with local chemical safety guidelines. Ensure proper PPE when handling, and only work with the solid powder forms of these chemicals in a chemical fume hood to prevent inhalation.\n\t\t\nMinimum of 0.05 mL of sodium selenite in water at 0.518 mg/mL, 0.5 mL of putrescine in water at 160 mg/mL, 0.165 mL of progesterone in 100% ethanol at 0.6 mg/mL (see Table of Materials).\nStore solutions at -20 °C for up to 2 years.\nIn a biosafety cabinet (BSC), add the following to 58.035 mL of DMEM-F12.\n\t\t\n0.05 mL of a 0.518 mg/mL sodium selenite solution, 0.5 mL of a 160 mg/mL putrescine solution, 0.165 mL of a 0.6 mg/mL progesterone solution.\nFilter sterilize the above mixture with a 0.22 µm filter.\nStill in the BSC, prepare a 100 mg/mL solution of apotransferrin.\n\t\t\nAdd 5 mL of DMEM-F12 to 500 mg of apotransferrin (see Table of Materials). Slowly resuspend and wash the container, avoiding bubbles.\nAfter resuspending and removing as much as possible with 5 mL, add it to the selenite/putrescine/progesterone solution. Take more of the previous solution and wash the apotransferrin bottle, getting as much of it out as possible.\nAdd 5 mL of 7.5% BSA fraction V (see Table of Materials) to the solution.",
    "Mix and aliquot 6.875 mL per tube. Store aliquots at -80 °C for up to 1 year.\nWhen using the above N2 aliquots to make N2B27 media, thaw the desired aliquot and add 3.125 mL of a 4 mg/mL insulin solution (see Table of Materials) to the 6.875 N2 for 10 mL of 100x N2.\nPrepare N2B27 basal media.\n\t\nThaw N2 and B27 supplements in a 4 °C fridge for a few hours or overnight.\nIn a BSC, mix 484.5 mL of DMEM-F12 and 484.5 mL of Neurobasal media (see Table of Materials) in a sterile 1 L bottle.\nAdd 10 mL of B27 and 10 mL of N2 supplement to the media.\nAdd 1 mL of 55 mM beta-mercaptoethanol (see Table of Materials). Add 10 mL of 100x glutamax. Mix vigorously by swirling the bottle.\nAliquot the desired volume per aliquot (typically 100 mL) and store at -80 °C for up to 1 year. Store in use after thawing at 4 °C for up to 3 weeks.\nPrepare NBiL media.\n\t\nThaw a 100 mL aliquot of N2B27 basal media from -80 °C in the 4 °C fridge.\nIn a BSC, add LIF (see Table of Materials) to a final concentration of 10 µg/L.\nAdd CHIR99021 (3 µM final) and PD0325901 (1 µM final) (see Table of Materials). Mix well with a 50 mL serological pipette. Store at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks.\nPrepare 0.2% gelatin solution.\n\t\nTransfer 500 mL of double-distilled H2O into a 1 L glass bottle.\nMeasure out 1 g of gelatin (see Table of Materials) and add it to the water. Mix by shaking the bottle until mostly dissolved.",
    "Autoclave the gelatin and water mixture at 15 psi, 121 °C for 35 min. Once cooled, filter sterilize it with a 0.22 µm filter in a BSC. Store at 4 °C.\nPrepare wash media.\n\t\nIn a BSC, mix 160 µL of 7.5% BSA per 10 mL of DMEM-F12.\nScale the above and prepare in large quantities for ease of future use (e.g. 8 mL of 7.5% BSA to 500 mL of DMEM-F12). Store at 4 °C.\n2. Preparation of reagents for mPSC poly-transfection\nNOTE: The following values are provided for a single well of a 24-well plate. Values can be scaled accordingly. The sequences of all the DNA/plasmids are detailed in Supplementary File 1.\nCalculate the volume of DNA solution needed per treatment.\n\t\nPrepare 500 ng of DNA per well/condition.\n\t\t\nIf transfecting a single plasmid with a DNA solution of 100 ng/µL, prepare one tube with 5 µL of DNA.\nIf transfecting two plasmids at 100 ng/µL each, prepare two tubes with 2.5 µL in each, one for each plasmid.\nIn a BSC, perform the following: For each 500 ng transfection treatment (see Table of Materials), aliquot 25 µL of OptiMEM into a 1.5 mL tube.\n\t\nScale this accordingly - for the example above, prepare two tubes, each with 250 ng of DNA (2.5 µL) and 12.5 µL of OptiMEM.\nAdd the required volume of DNA for that treatment to the OptiMEM in the tube.\nFor each tube with 500 ng DNA and OptiMEM, create a matching tube with another 25 µL of OptiMEM and 1 µL of cationic lipid-based transfection reagent.\n\t\nAgain, these values must be scaled accordingly. For the above example, prepare two tubes, each with 12.5 µL of OptiMEM and 0.5 µL of transfection reagent.",
    "​NOTE: When scaling values, use the mass of DNA added, not the volume required for that amount of DNA. Reactions with transfection reagent and DNA can be scaled (e.g., if 5 wells are to be transfected with the same DNA). Keep the ratios of reagents the same, but scale accordingly (e.g., 1000 ng DNA: 50 µL OptiMEM: 2 µL transfection reagent: 50 µL OptiMEM).\n3. Preparation of mPSCs for transfection\nNOTE: For reverse transfection, prepare the culture vessel and passage the mPSCs directly before adding the transfection reagents. For forward transfection, passage and plate the cells 12-18 h prior to transfection to allow the cells to adhere to the plate.\nPrepare a 0.2% gelatin-coated cell culture vessel.\n\t\nPlan the number of wells needed for the transfection (one well of a 24-well plate per treatment/group).\nAdd 200 µL of the 0.2% gelatin solution to each of the desired wells in the 24-well plate.\nGently shake the plate to evenly spread the solution, ensuring it covers the entire bottom of the well.\nAllow the wells to coat for a minimum of 15 min at room temperature.\nUsing a vacuum aspirator, carefully remove any leftover gelatin from the wells (tilt the plate to ensure removal of all liquid without scraping off the gelatin layer).\nAdd 0.5 mL of NBiL media (step 1.3) to each well and leave the plate in a tissue culture incubator to prewarm.\nPassage mPSCs.\n\t\nAliquot 30 mL of wash media (step 1.5) into a 50 mL conical tube.\nAspirate the old media from the tissue culture dish of mESCs.\n\t\t​NOTE: Several aspiration techniques are permissible. Whatever technique is chosen, ensure that cells do not remain dry for extended periods (approximately 30 s maximum).",
    "Add the required amount of commercially available cell detatchment medium (1.5 mL for a 10 cm dish, scale accordingly, see Table of Materials).\nWait for 3-5 min before pipetting up and down 15-20 times with a P1000 pipette to obtain a single-cell suspension. View cells under a microscope to ensure a single-cell suspension.\nTransfer the cells in the detatchment medium into the 50 mL tube containing wash media.\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Aspirate wash media, ensuring no residual liquid remains in the tube.\nResuspend the pellet in a small volume of wash media (~300 µL). Count the cell suspension using a hemocytometer to obtain the cell density.\n4. Reverse transfection of mPSCs\nPrepare poly-transfection reagents according to step 2.\nPrepare the cell culture vessel and passage mPSCs according to step 3.\nAliquot 200 µL of NBiL media to 1.5 mL tubes, one for each treatment.\nAdd 26 µL of the OptiMEM:transfection reagent mixture to the DNA:OptiMEM mixture. Mix the reagents quickly and vigorously by pipetting approximately 10 times. Allow the mixture to incubate at room temperature for 5 min.\nBased on cell density, transfer the required volume of cells from the 300 µL cell suspension to the 200 µL NBiL tubes to obtain 25,000 cells per tube.\nAfter 5 min of incubation of the Lipofectamine 2000 (L2K, transfection reagent) and DNA mixture, add it to the 1.5 mL tube of cells and mix well by pipetting. Allow the cells to incubate with the reagent for 5 min at room temperature.\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Pipette out the liquid, leaving approximately 50 µL.",
    "Resuspend the cell pellet with 100 µL of NBiL media. Transfer the cells to the plate and place the plate in the incubator. Change the media 24 h later with fresh NBiL media.\n5. Forward transfection of mPSCs\n12-18 h prior to transfection, prepare the cell culture vessel and passage mPSCs according to step 3.\nBased on cell density, transfer the required volume of cells from the 300 µL cell mixture to seed 25,000 cells per well. Place the plate in the incubator.\n1 h prior to transfection, aspirate the media from all wells and replace it with 0.5 mL of NBiL media. Place the plate in the incubator.\nAt the time of transfection, prepare mPSC poly-transfection reagents according to step 2.\nAdd 26 µL of the OptiMEM:transfection reagent mixture to the DNA:OptiMEM mixture. Mix the reagents quickly and vigorously by pipetting approximately 10 times. Allow the combined mixture to incubate at room temperature for 5 min.\nAdd the combined mixture to the wells dropwise. Place the plate in the incubator. Change the media 24 h later.\n6. Flow cytometry\nAspirate the media from the transfected 24-well plate 48 h after transfection.\nAdd 200 µL of trypsin to each well, swirl, and incubate for 30 s at 37 °C. Tap the sides of the plate and add 200 µL of ice-cold FACS buffer (2% FBS in PBS).\nOpen and label a V-bottom 96-well plate, starting from A1. Mix the contents of each well on the transfected plate to dislodge cells and make single-cell solutions with a P200 pipette. Transfer 200 µL from each well to the appropriate well on the 96-well plate.",
    "Add 15 mL of FACS buffer to a 50 mL reagent reservoir. Centrifuge the plate at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant by inverting the 96-well plate into the sink with a fast and smooth movement.\nUse a multichannel pipette to resuspend the pellets on the 96-well plate in 150 µL of FACS buffer from the reagent reservoir. Repeat steps 6.4-6.5 twice. Place the 96-well plate in an ice-filled box protected from light.\nRun the samples through a flow cytometer to obtain the population distributions of the fluorescent reporters.\n\t\nEnsure the cytometer is appropriate in terms of laser and filter combinations for the experiment to be performed (e.g., do not use an infrared reporter if it is not possible to excite or detect in the far-red spectrum).\nInclude additional samples for standardization beads to allow for MEFL conversion of data during analysis. Ensure that enough cells are collected per sample for appropriate statistical analysis9.\nConvert fluorescent units from the raw cytometer files and analyze the data using any of several methods, such as Python- or MATLAB-based pipelines or commercially available software9,13.\nSubscription Required.
