    "Note: Here, the procedure is described for using frozen, ground leaf tissue but the method should be easily adaptable for other materials.    Shock-freeze leaf tissue (age does not matter, however, no senescence symptoms should be visible) or any material of choice (cell suspension culturue, e.g., N. benthamiana leaves in liquid nitrogen. Note: If using transient expression by agroinfiltration, or other transient expression methods, the time until your protein is expressed at high levels might vary, depending on the protein, promoter etc. Make sure to use a tag in order for expression level to be detected.   Grind tissue in liquid N2 to a fine powder with mortar and pestle.   Using a pre-cooled spatula, place the right amount of tissue in a pre-cooled 1.5 ml reaction tube. We use 500 mg tissue (frozen) for 10-12 individual samples/measurements (~ 40-50 mg per sample).   Suspend in binding buffer (700-1,000 µl).    Centrifuge suspension to create a pellet (13,000 x g, 1 min, 4 °C).   Resuspend the pellet in binding buffer (500 mg tissue/ml binding buffer).   Aliquot in 1.5 ml reaction tubes, 80 μl in each tube (n ≥ 3 per treatment). Cut off the tip of the pipette helps to avoid clogging of tissue at the tip and to get an even distribution of tissue in the samples.   Add 20 μl of a solution containing the desired combination of acridinium labeled peptide and unlabeled peptide (peptides should be solved/diluted in binding buffer) to reach 100 μl.  Note: Use a final concentration of 0.1 to 10 nM acridinium labeled peptide in your 100 µl sample. Run replicates (n ≥ 3) and samples containing an excess (>1,000-fold) of unlabeled peptide to determine non-specific binding (e.g. 1 nM Acridinium-peptide plus 1 µM unlabeled peptide as competitor).    20 min incubation (4 °C).",
    "Note: Reaching binding equilibrium/saturation may differ and experiments to optimize may be necessary. When no specific binding could be detected, parameters such as incubation time or temperature could be increased.   Sediment the sample by centrifugation (13,000 x g, 1 min, 4 °C), pipette off and discard the supernatant.   Wash the pellet 2-3 times by resuspension in 1 ml binding buffer and centrifugation (13,000 x g, 1 min, 4 °C). Note: Keep the total time required for these washing steps at a minimum! Depending on their dissociation rates, prolonged washing may lead to considerable loss of ligand binding.    Resuspend the final pellet in 100 μl 5 mM citric acid.   Place tube in the luminometer.    Start the software and the program so it is ready to start collecting light immediately after induction with the NaOH/H2O2 solution.  Note: Depending on your luminometer/software, you should monitor emitted light in a continuous mode or, if not possible in shortest possible intervals (e.g. each 0.2 sec or 0.5 sec) over time.   Inject 100 μl of 100 mM NaOH containing 0.03% H2O2 (induction of luminescence) into the tube/cuvette containing your sample.   Collect data for 10-30 sec. Note: The oxidation and light emission proceeds rapidly and should lead to a short flash of light (Joss and Towbin, 1994; Butenko et al., 2014). However, assay conditions and plant material may slow down the reaction. Nevertheless, integration time of 10-30 sec should be sufficient to collect > 90 % of the light emitted (Figure 1)."
