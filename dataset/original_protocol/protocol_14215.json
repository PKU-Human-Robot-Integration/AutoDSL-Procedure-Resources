    "NOTE: It is recommended to work in a fume hood when handling organic solvent, such as methanol. Prepare all buffers and mobile phases in volumetric flasks. If not otherwise specified, the solutions can be stored at room temperature for up to 1 month after preparation.\n1. Preparation of the Calibrators and Quality Control Samples\nNOTE: A corresponding data analysis sheet for the preparation of stock and spike solutions is given in the Supplemental File. For reasons of traceability, insert the manufacturer, catalog number, and a lot number of each antibiotic in the corresponding columns. Dissolve all antibiotics in a cold storage at 4 °C and keep the working time as short as possible.\nPrepare 100 mL of 25% methanol in water: prefill a 100 mL volumetric flask with 25 mL of absolute methanol and fill it up to 100 mL with distilled water.\nPrepare 10 mL of 200 mM acetic acid in water: prefill a 10 mL volumetric flask with 9 mL of HPLC grade water, add 115 µL of glacial acetic acid (99.5% purity, 17.4 M), and add distilled water up to 10 mL.\nPrepare 25 mL of 25% methanol in water with 20 mM acetic acid: prefill a 25 mL volumetric flask with 2.5 mL of the aqueous 200 mM acetic acid solution, add 6.25 mL of absolute methanol, and fill up the flask to 25 mL with distilled water.\nUse a precision scale to weigh the proper amounts of antibiotics in 15-mL conical tubes as described in the Supplemental File in the column initial weight.",
    "Prepare stock solutions of the fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin in the 25% methanol-water including 20 mM acetic acid. To do this, add the corresponding volume to the weighted quantities as described in the Supplemental File in the column \"final volume\". Rapidly dissolve the fluoroquinolone antibiotics in an ultrasound bath for 2 min and by intense vortexing.\nPrepare stock solutions of cefepime, meropenem, linezolid, and piperacillin in the 25% methanol-water. To do this, add the corresponding volume to the weighted quantities as described in the Supplemental File in the column final volume and rapidly dissolve the antibiotics by intense vortexing. Dissolve meropenem as the last substance.\nCombine the stock solutions of all the antibiotics as described in the corresponding volume of stock solution chart in the Supplemental File to yield tenfold concentrated spike-solutions.\nSpike nine volumes of drug-free serum with one volume of the tenfold concentrated spike solutions to obtain the serum calibrators 0–7 and quality controls (QC) A–D. For example, add 0.5 mL of spike solution to 4.5 mL of serum in a 10-mL polypropylene tube and incubate it for 15 min in the cold storage at 4 °C on a roller mixer at 50 rpm.\nUse a repetitive pipette to generate 100 µL aliquots of the calibrators and QCs in 1.5 mL polypropylene tubes.\nStore the calibrators, quality controls, and antibiotic stock solutions at -80 °C for up to six months.\nFor each antibiotic, also prepare a neat solution containing 1,000 mg/L of a single antibiotic. Dilute the corresponding stock solution with an appropriate diluent (e.g., for ciprofloxacin, use 25% methanol-water including 20 mM acetic acid).\n\tNOTE: The neat antibiotic solutions are required for the instrument-tuning only.\n2. Preparation of the Internal Standards Mix",
    "NOTE: Internal standards are isotope-labeled counterparts of the analytes of interest that are added to a sample during sample cleanup. As the internal standards have almost identical overall physicochemical properties to their unlabeled counterparts, they compensate for the matrix effects of a given sample.\nPrepare 10 mL of 50% methanol in water by adding 5 mL of absolute methanol to a 10 mL shake flask and fill it up to 10 mL with distilled water.\nPrepare 10 mL of 50% methanol in water including 20 mM acetic acid. To do this, add 1 mL of 200 mM acetic acid to a 10 mL flask, add 5 mL of absolute methanol, and fill it up to 10 mL with distilled water.\nGenerate stock solutions of internal standards (IS) with 1,000 mg/L directly in the vials provided by the manufacturer. Dissolve cefepime-13C12D3 sulfate in distilled water, meropenem-D6, linezolid-D3, and piperacillin-D5 in a 50% methanol-water solution. Dissolve ciprofloxacin-D8 in 50% methanol-water with 20 mM acetate and moxifloxacin hydrochloride-13C1D3 in distilled water with 20 mM acetate.\nCombine the IS stock solutions in a 1.5 mL polypropylene tube to yield a fivefold concentrated internal standard mix. Add 10 µL of cefepime-13C12D3, 10 µL of meropenem-D6, 1 µL of ciprofloxacin-D8, 2 µL of moxifloxacin hydrochloride-13C1D3, 2 µL of linezolid-D3, and 10 µL of piperacillin-D5 to 965 µL of 25% methanol-water.\nStore the internal standard stock solutions and the fivefold concentrated IS mix at -80 °C.\n3. Patient Sample Storage\nNOTE: Ensure that the serum is obtained as fast as possible and that the cold chain of frozen samples is maintained.\nCollect the whole blood in the serum collection tubes.\nLet the blood clot for 20–30 min at room temperature.\nSeparate the serum from the blood by centrifugation at 2,000 x g for 10 min.",
    "Transfer the supernatant to a clean polypropylene tube.\nStore the serum up to six months at -80 °C until it is assayed. Alternatively, store the samples up to 3 days at -20 °C.\n4. Buffer Preparation for Chromatography\nTo prepare 1 M ammonium formate in water, dissolve 6.306 g of ammonium formate in 100 mL of HPLC grade water using a 100 mL shake flask. Store the solution up to 1 month at 4 °C.\nPrepare the mobile phase A [10 mM ammonium formate in water-formic acid (99.9:0.1 v/v)]. Prefill a 1,000 mL volumetric flask with approximately 500 mL of HPLC grade water, add 1 mL of formic acid and 10 mL of the 1 M ammonium formate solution, and fill it to 1,000 mL with HPLC grade water. Transfer mobile phase A to a clean glass bottle and connect it to the HPLC system. Store mobile phase A up to 2 weeks at room temperature.\nPrepare the mobile phase B. Transfer HPLC-grade absolute methanol into a clean glass bottle and connect it to the HPLC system.\nUse absolute methanol as the needle wash solvent and connect the corresponding tube to the glass bottle containing mobile phase B.\nGenerate the seal and a purge solvent of methanol-water-formic acid (7:92.9:0.1, v/v/v). Prefill a 1,000 mL volumetric flask with approximately 500 mL of distilled water, add 70 mL of absolute methanol, 1 mL of formic acid, and add distilled water to 1,000 mL. Transfer the solvent to a clean glass bottle and connect it with the HPLC system.",
    "Note: Various autosampler systems use both a strong and a weak needle wash solvent. In such a case, prepare the wash solutions according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. For example, do the strong wash with methanol-water-isopropylic alcohol (70:20:10, v/v/v) and the weak wash with water-methanol (95:5, v/v).\n5. Instrument Tuning\nNOTE: This step is performed for the set-up of the method on a specific mass spectrometer.\nDilute the neat 1,000 mg/L analyte and the internal standard solutions 1:10 or 1:100 in a mixture of mobile phase A and B (50:50, v/v), depending on the detector signal intensities. Tune the mass spectrometer with the autotune function or do a manual tuning for the following parent-to-daughter ions transitions14: cefepime (481.0 > 167.0/395.7), cefepime-13C12D3 (485.1 > 167.1/400.0), meropenem (384.1 > 114.0/141.0), meropenem-D6 (390.1 > 114.0/147.2), ciprofloxacin (332.0 > 231.0/245.0), ciprofloxacin-D8 (340.1 > 235.1/249.3), moxifloxacin (402.0 > 261.0/383.9), moxifloxacin-13C1D3 (406.1 > 265.1/388.0), linezolid (338.0 > 235.0/296.0), linezolid-D3 (341.1 > 235.1/297.1), piperacillin (518.0 > 143.0/358.9), and piperacillin-D5 (523.1 > 142.8/364.1).\nFor instruments with autotuning, use the autotune function to automatically adjust the voltage and settings of the MS inlet through the detectors.\nFor instruments with manual tuning, adjust the settings (e.g., collision voltage and collision energy) until the optimum (usually the maximum) signal intensity is obtained at the detector for each parent and daughter ion. For example, plug a mixing tee, deliver mobile phase A and B (50:50, v/v) at 0.5 mL/min, and continuously infuse the neat antibiotic or internal standard with a flow rate of 0.1 mL/min.\n6. HPLC-MS/MS Set-up\nNOTE: Features of the mass spectrometer, HPLC system (including the autosampler), and the corresponding software depend on the manufacturer. Adapt the mass spectrometer parameters and the wash procedure according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.",
    "Store the mass spectrometer parameters in a corresponding 'MS tune file'. Use electrospray ionization in the positive mode (ESI+) for all analytes. Adapt the ion source settings for the instrument used (e.g., a capillary voltage of 1.5 kV, a source temperature of 120 °C, a desolvation temperature of 400 °C, a desolvation gas flow rate of 600 L/h, an RF lens voltage of 0.1 V, and a dwell time of 80 ms).\nSpecify the analyte and internal standards tune parameters (e.g., capillary voltage, collision energy) in an 'MS file'.\nSet the autosampler conditions as follows in the 'inlet file': the sample temperature at 10 °C with a limit of ± 5 °C; the wash sequence at 1x purge-wash-purge with a 600 µL purge volume replacement.\nIn the above-mentioned 'inlet file', set the flow rate to 0.4 or 0.5 mL/min, the run time to 4 min, the pressure high limit to 345 bar, and the column temperature to 30 °C with a limit of ± 5 °C. Add the solvent name of mobile phases A and B and set them to 7% B/93% A, respectively.\nProgram the chromatographic gradient in the 'inlet file' as follows: 0.00–0.10 min with 7% mobile phase B/93% A, 0.11–0.60 min with 65% mobile phase B/35% A, 0.61–2.10 min with 95% mobile phase B/5% A, 2.11–4.00 min with 7% mobile phase B/93% A.\n\tNOTE: Calculate the extra-column volume, the hold-up volume for the instrumental platform, and the analyte retention factors as described in the USP <621> Chromatography guideline16.\n7. Sample Measurement Master File",
    "NOTE: With the 'sample measurement master file', the patient samples are specified, the HPLC-MS/MS analysis is started, and the data evaluation is performed. Two separate template files including a low- and high-quality control pair are generated; one template includes QC pair A and C, the other one QC pair B and D.\nCreate a new 'sample measurement master file'. Select the above-mentioned 'MS tune file', 'MS file', and 'inlet file' (section 6), insert them in each sample line, and specify the injection volume with 15 µL.\nIn ascending order, add the “sample text” for calibrators 0–7 and quality control (QC) pair A/C or QC pair B/D.\nSpecify the sample type. Select the sample type “standard” for the calibrators and “QC” for the quality control pairs.\nSpecify the concentration of each antibiotic substance for the corresponding calibrators and quality controls (see the spreadsheet, concentration [µg/mL] Cal 7–Cal 0, QC A/C or B/D,).\nProgram the 'data evaluation method'. Use the transitions that were optimized during the instrument tuning (section 5). Match each antibiotic with the corresponding isotope-labeled standard (e.g., meropenem - meropenem-D6).\n8. Sample Cleanup and HPLC-MS/MS Analysis\nNOTE: For each sample batch, a paired quality control set with a low and high antibiotic concentration (QC A/C or QC B/D) is processed and analyzed. Between different batches, the paired QC samples are used in an alternate sequence (e.g., on day 1, select the 'sample measurement master file' including QC pair A/C; on day 2, select the one including QC pair B/D. The processing of the serum samples is illustrated in Figure 1.\nPrepare the precipitation agent 10% methyl-tert-butyl ether in methanol (10:90, v/v) (e.g., prefill a 25-mL volumetric flask with 2.5 mL of methyl-tert-butyl ether and fill it to 25 mL with absolute methanol).",
    "Place the C8 reverse phase into the column chamber. Connect it to the HPLC and mass spectrometer in the direction of the flow.\nGenerate the sample list. Open the corresponding 'sample measurement master file' template and add the patient samples meant to be processed to the list. Generate groups of up to 20 patient samples and flank them with the corresponding quality control pair.\nWet-prime the HPCL system using the 'inlet file' control software: set the “wet prime” function to 50% mobile phase A/50% B, and wet-prime for 2 min with a flow rate of 1 mL/min.\nRefresh the syringe. To do this, execute 6 strokes of 600 µL in the control software.\nEquilibrate the C8 reverse phase column. Using the software, turn on the flow in the 'inlet file' and flush it with 7% mobile phase B/93% A for a minimum of 5 min, using a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. Verify the column temperature of 30 °C.\nThaw the patient samples, one aliquot of calibrators 0–7, and a quality control pair (either A/B or C/D).\nWith a repetitive pipette, add 25 µL of the internal standard mix to the 100 µL calibrator, QC sample, or patient serum in a 1.5 mL polypropylene tube, and vortex the tube for a few seconds.\nIncubate the mixture for 5 min at room temperature on a benchtop shaker (e.g., at 1,200 rpm).\nWith a repetitive pipette, add 150 µL of a precipitation reagent to the sample-internal standard mix.\nAgain, vortex the tube for a few seconds and incubate it for 5 min at room temperature on a benchtop shaker (e.g., at 1,200 rpm).\nCentrifuge the suspension at 20,000 x g in a tabletop centrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C.",
    "Dilute the supernatant 1:3 with HPLC grade water using a glass vial with a micro-insert and load it as processed samples to the autosampler.\nManually start the HPLC-MS/MS analysis in the 'sample measurement control file'.\n\tNOTE: For prolonged storage, thoroughly flush the analytical column according to the manufacturer’s recommendation [e.g., 0.5 mL/min methanol-water (50:50, v/v)] to prevent phase collapse.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58148/58148fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Schematic representation of the sample cleanup. Protein precipitation at the high centrifugal force gives a dense pellet and clear supernatant, indicating that protein precipitation was complete. The entire processing time is approximately 30 min, including the sample cleanup, the chromatographic separation, and the MS/MS analysis.

Quality Assessment and Quantification\nTo process the samples, open the corresponding 'sample measurement control file', select the calibrators, quality controls, and patient samples, and evaluate them with the 'antibiotics quantification method'. \nCheck whether the peaks for a specific analyte are properly integrated. Inspect the peaks for each calibrator, QC, and patient sample, and manually reintegrate them at the baseline if necessary.\nStudy the calibration curve and examine whether it fulfills the following quality criteria: a) linearity over the entire calibration range, b) a calibration coefficient r2 > 0.995, c) the deviation of each calibration standard within ± 15% of the nominal value, except for the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), where ± 20% is required.\nReject a calibration standard not complying with the above-mentioned criteria and re-evaluate the calibration curve, including the regression analysis.\nStudy the quality controls and examine whether the deviations are within ± 15% of the nominal value.",
    "If the concentration of a patient sample exceeds the concentration of the highest calibrator, dilute the sample with distilled water, up to 1:5 (e.g., 100 µL of serum plus 400 µL of distilled water) before the sample cleanup. Reperform steps 8.8–8.14 for that specific sample and reprocess it.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
