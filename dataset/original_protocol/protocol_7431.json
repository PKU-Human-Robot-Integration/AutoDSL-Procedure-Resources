    "Equipment setup GC setupChromatography: Perform chromatography with a 30 m capillary HP-5MS GC column, using ultra-high pure helium as the carrier gas set at a constant pressure of 1.2 mL/min. Set the injection port temperature to 240 °C and the transfer line temperature to 280 °C. Run samples in splitless mode. Use the temperature program shown in Table 1 for chromatography.Table 1.

    "MS setupAuto-tune the instrument according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Sample preparation and analysis For pathogen assays, infiltrate the largest three leaves of ~4-week-old plants with either 10 mM MgCl2 or the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae avrRpt2 using a needleless syringe from the abaxial side of the leaves. After leaf infiltration, remove excess droplets of 10 mM MgCl2 or pathogen suspension with Kimwipes.Approximately 16 h later, collect ~10–100 mg infiltrated leaf tissue. Sample the entire leaf using a pair of scissors.Weigh the tissue using a balance that is accurate to the 1 mg digit. Record the weight of each sample. ∆CRITICAL STEP Lyophilize the leaf tissue overnight in aluminum foil. Weigh and place approximately 1–10 mg of dry leaf tissue in an autoclaved microfuge tube.Drop the microfuge tubes containing lyophilized tissue into a Dewar flask containing liquid nitrogen. Store frozen tissues at -80 °C until further analysis. •PAUSE POINT Grind the tissue to a fine powder with a plastic pestle and immediately add 1,000 µL of extraction buffer before the tissue is thawed. ∆CRITICAL STEP Add 2 µg of internal standard to the extract.Cap the tubes with explosion proof clips and boil immediately in water for 5 min using an electric multi-cooker. ∆CRITICAL STEP Centrifuge the tubes at 18,000 × g for 15 min.Transfer the supernatant to a 13 × 100 mm glass test tube.Dry the supernatant with a stream of nitrogen gas. Dried extract can be stored at -20 °C indefinitely. •PAUSE POINT Add 250 µL of water to the dried extract and vortex the tube for 30 s.Centrifuge the tubes at ~80% speed (approximately 1,250 × g) for 1 min in a tabletop swing-arm centrifuge.Transfer the supernatant to a fresh microfuge tube followed by incubation at -80 °C for 30 min (this step is for sample cleanup).",
    "Thaw the samples at room temperature and then centrifuge at 18,000 × g for 6 min.Transfer the supernatant to a GC vial and dry with a stream of nitrogen gas.Wash the vial with 500 µL of acetone to remove residual water in the sample and then dry again with a stream of nitrogen gas.Use microcapillary pipets to add 50–75 µL of acetonitrile to the dried samples, vortex the vials for 10 s, and add 50–75 µL of MSTFA containing 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TCMS). Incubate the samples at 65 °C for 1 h and transfer the contents to a GC insert with a Pasteur pipet.Inject 0.5–1 µL into GC/MS for analysis using selective ion monitoring mode (SIM) using quantifier ions 299 (G3P) and 217 (ribitol) and qualifier ions 357 and 445 for G3P, and 147 and 307 for ribitol.GC-MS data from standard compound analysis Figure 2 shows the total ion chromatogram (top panel) and corresponding MS of ribitol (middle panel) and G3P (bottom panel) standards run in scan mode.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4645/bioprotoc-13-07-4645-g002.jpgFigure 2.

Based on the mass spectra shown in Figure 2, three major ions were used to monitor G3P (299, 357, 445) and ribitol (217, 147, 307) in SIM mode.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4645/bioprotoc-13-07-4645-g003.jpgFigure 3.",
