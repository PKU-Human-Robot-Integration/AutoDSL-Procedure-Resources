    "1. Production of Saccharina latissima gametophytes\nCollect mature sporophytes of S. latissima from the wild as previously described20,21. Ensure that the selected sporophytes are devoid of epiphytes (small organisms visible on the blade's surface) or internal parasites (found in the bleached areas or spots on the blade). \nUsing a scalpel, cut the darkest part in the center of the blade (fertile spore-producing tissue22) into 1-5 square pieces (1 cm²), avoiding any bleached spots, if present.\nRemove any remaining epiphytes by gently cleaning the cut pieces with the back of a scalpel and some absorbent paper.\nPlace the cleaned pieces in a glass dish filled with sterile natural seawater (see Table of Materials) for 45 min to release spores following previously published report22.\nRemove the blade pieces and filter the seawater through a 40 µm cell strainer to remove debris or unwanted organisms.\nDilute the spores in the filtrate to a 20-40 spores/mL concentration in plastic Petri dishes22.\nPlace the spore solution in a culture cabinet (see Table of Materials) configured with the optimal culture conditions (13 °C, 24 µE.m-2.s-1, photoperiod 16:8 L:D).\nAllow the spores to germinate and develop into gametophytes.\n\tNOTE: Spore germination is visible after 2 days in the cabinet, and the first cell division of the gametophytic cells usually occurs within the following 48 h.\nReplace the growth medium after 5 days with micro-filtered natural seawater enriched with a 0.5x Provasoli solution (NSW1/2) (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: To avoid repeating these steps, specific male and female gametophytes can be selected and vegetatively propagated for several months. The gametophytes remain vegetative when grown under red light (4 µE.m-2.s-1 with a wavelength of at least 580 nm)23 in the same culture conditions described above (step 1.7).\n2. Fragmentation and induction of oogenesis\nHarvest gametophytes with a cell scraper.",
    "Using a small plastic pestle, crush the collected gametophytes in a 1.5 mL tube into 4-5-celled pieces.\nFill the tube with 1 mL NSW1/2 (step 1.9).\nAdd 2.5 µL of the crushed gametophyte solution into 3 mL of natural seawater enriched with 1x Provasoli solution (NSW) and place them in a Petri dish.\n\tNOTE: A 25 mm, glass-bottomed Petri dish is recommended for easier handling.\nPlace the prepared dishes in a culture cabinet and induce gametogenesis at 13 °C under white light with an intensity of 24 µE.m-2.s-1 (dim light, photoperiod 16:8 L:D).\n\tNOTE: The first gametangia (female oogonia and male archegonia) can be observed after 5 days. The male is hyper-branched with small cells, and the female is composed of larger cells forming long filaments15,22. The first eggs are observed ~10 days later, and the first division of zygotes usually occurs within the following 2 days.\nSix days after observing the first eggs, transfer the dishes to brighter white light conditions: 50 µE.m-2.s-1, photoperiod 16:8 L:D, still at 13 °C.\n3. Image acquisition for selecting embryos for ablation and monitoring subsequent growth\nImage the entire Petri dish to (re)locate the embryos selected during the ablation step (no need to return the dish to the ocular microscope) and monitor the subsequent development of the selected embryos.\n\tNOTE: Use an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope (see Table of Materials) for imaging (Figure 1), and the laser ablation is described in step 5.\nPlace the Petri dish on the stage and orientate it with a visual mark (e.g., draw a line with a permanent marker).\nUse the 10x/0.45 objective to focus on an embryo. Record the position of the four cardinal points of the Petri dish.",
    "Start the tile scan. Acquire transmitted/fluorescent images of the whole Petri dish at low resolution: 256 x 256 pixels, a pixel dwell time of 1.54 µs with bidirectional scanning, and a digital zoom of 0.6x using a 561 nm laser at 1.2% transmission.\n\tNOTE: The scan time for a whole 2.5 cm Petri dish is ~6 min for 225 tiles (Figure 2). Here, the 561 nm laser was used for transmission and fluorescence imaging. The fluorescence signal was collected between 580–720 nm on the confocal photomultipliers (PMT) and the transmitted light was collected on the transmitted PMT. The 561 nm laser can also monitor chlorophyll at this step, but it is unnecessary because it only helps distinguish the signal noise and the organisms correctly.\nSave the tile scan image and keep it open in the image acquisition software (see Table of Materials) window.\nChange the objective, do not remove the Petri dish.\n\tNOTE: The 40x/1.2 water objective was moved to the side of the stage so that the immersion medium (water) could be added to the objective without moving the Petri dish from its initial position.\nNavigate through the previously acquired tile scan image to select the appropriate embryo. Once an embryo has been identified on this image, move the stage to the exact position of the embryo and acquire transmitted/fluorescent images of that embryo at high resolution.\n\tNOTE: High-resolution settings: 512 x 512 pixels, 0.130 µm/pixel, 0.208 µs pixel dwell time with mono-directional scanning and 2x digital zoom using a 561 nm laser at 0.9% transmission.\nAnnotate the tile scan image for each embryo candidate for laser ablation (Figure 2B) and proceed to the laser ablation step.\n4. Laser calibration",
    "Calibrate the laser and synchronize the image acquisition software with the laser-driver software in the \"Click & Fire mode\" and a pulsed 355 nm laser.\n\tNOTE: This step is crucial to ensure perfect synchronization between the mouse cursor's position in the laser-driver software (see Table of Materials) with the position in the live image of the acquisition software.\nOpen the laser-driver software package and click on Live in the image acquisition software package.\nSynchronize both software packages by clicking on Start acquisition in the laser-driver software package. The live image is now also recorded in the UV laser-driver software.\nDefine an area of interest (AOI) by clicking on Choose AOI button and clicking on the edges of the image (right, left, top and bottom) in the UV laser-driver software package.\n\tNOTE: After this calibration step, the settings for pixel size, image format, and zoom in the acquisition software package must remain constant.\nSelect an empty area on the dish and lower the level of the stage to 20 µm below the sample focal plane to focus on the glass bottom.\nSet the ablation laser and imaging laser trajectories by clicking on Start calibration and choose Manual calibration.\nSelect a laser power high enough to see a black dot in the center of the live image corresponding to the hole in the glass coverslip (all the shutters must be open).\nClick on this central black dot with the mouse cursor and click on 18 additional dots proposed by the software to complete the alignment procedure.\nCheck the calibration in the \"Click & Fire mode\" on the same coverslip.",
    "NOTE: Laser calibration depends on the imaging parameters. Once the laser has been calibrated, ensure that the imaging parameters (i.e., 512 x 512 pixels, 0.130 µm/pixel, 0.208 µs pixel dwell time with mono-directional scanning and 2x digital zoom) have not changed.\n5. Laser ablation\nSelect an embryo of interest. Start a time-lapse recording in the image-acquisition software.\nAcquire transmitted/fluorescence images with a 40x/1.2 W objective at high resolution (i.e., 512 x 512 pixels, 0.130 µm/pixel, 1.54 µs pixel dwell time with mono-directional scanning and 2x digital zoom using a 561 nm laser at 0.9% transmission). Acquire the time-lapse recording at maximum speed.\nZoom out of the area at the beginning of the time-lapse recording. Zoom in on the AOI.\nUse the \"Click & Fire\" function of the laser-driver software to apply the damaging irradiation on the cell of interest in the embryo. Use the following parameters: 45% laser transmission (corresponding to a maximum of 40 µW) and 1 ms pulse time duration (step 4).\n\tNOTE: Video recording during the laser shooting is recommended.\nUnder 688 nm, monitor the ejection of autofluorescent chloroplasts from the cytoplasm.\nIf cell contents remain in the cell, use the \"Click & Fire\" function once more to increase the size of the breach in the cell. Repeat, keeping the number of shots to a minimum until most of the cell contents have been released.\nStop the time-lapse recording after the embryo has stabilized (i.e., no further intracellular movement can be detected (~1-5 min).\nUpdate the annotation on the tile scan image, if necessary.\n6. Monitoring the growth of irradiated embryos\nNOTE: Monitoring is carried out over several days.\nDetermine the survival rate by monitoring the number of embryos that develop after laser ablation and compare them to those that die.",
    "NOTE: Some embryos die immediately after ablation for various reasons. A high and rapid mortality rate is usually a sign of inappropriate laser parameters or higher/longer exposure to stress during the experiment or subsequent transport.\nDetermine the growth delay by measuring the length of the laser-shot embryos every day and comparing it to intact embryos.\n\tNOTE: The growth rate of laser-shot organisms is generally slower than that of untreated organisms. However, some (inappropriate) laser settings can inhibit growth for more than a week, with growth resuming after that.\nFind out the adjacent damage by monitoring the reaction of cells adjacent to the ablated cells. In some cases, post-burst depressurization may cause neighboring cells to burst.\nCheck for microbe contaminations. Monitor the growth of microalgae and bacteria in the medium. If an unusual level of microbes are present in the dish, then discard it and repeat the protocol from step 2 or step 3.\n\tNOTE: After laser ablation, damaged S. latissima embryos are already highly stressed, and additional external stress can cause increased mortality. Bacterial or viral outbreaks are possible because the treated embryos cannot grow in axenic conditions.\nCheck the global development of the shot organisms by studying the phenotype and understanding the role in the development of the targeted region.\nSubscription Required.
