    "1. Generation of DNA Constructs\nDesigning Oligomers for Homologous Recombination of the Target Gene\nDesign a single 55-72 bp forward oligomer as follows: (a) pick a 19-32 bp long nucleotide sequence that is homologous to a DNA sequence in the region 10-100 bp upstream of the 5' start site of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene in the commercial pBAD33 plasmid,32 and (b) select a 36-54 bp long nucleotide sequence homologous to a region 10-150 bp downstream of the 5' start site of the target gene of interest.\nJoin the 3' end of nucleotide sequence picked in (b) to the 5' end of the nucleotide sequence picked in (a), thus giving a single 55-72 long forward oligomer.\nDesign a single 55-72 bp reverse oligomer as follows: (a) pick a 19-32 bp long nucleotide sequence that is homologous to a DNA sequence in the region 10-100 bp downstream of the 3' end of the chloramphenicol gene in the commercial pBAD33 plasmid, and (b) select a 36-54 bp long nucleotide sequence homologous to a region within 10-150 bp upstream of the 3' end site of the target gene of interest.\n\t\t\nJoin the 3' end of nucleotide sequence picked in (b) to the 5' end of the nucleotide sequence picked in (a) to make it a single oligomer.\nCopy this oligomer into any available bioinformatics software and convert sequence into its reverse complement. This will give a single 55-72 bp long reverse oligomer.\nUsing any available oligo-analyzer program, check that the recombination oligomers have GC content between 40-60%, low hairpin melting temperature (Tm), low self- and hetero-dimerization Tm's.

Copy this primer into any available bioinformatics program and convert the sequence into its reverse complement. This is the reverse primer.\n\t\t\nIn the case of genes encoding periplasmic proteins, design the reverse primer that is the reverse complement of the 3' end of a leader sequence that flanks the 5' end of the gene and is required for proper localization of the protein product in the periplasm.\nUsing any available oligo-analyzer program, check that the deletion primers have GC content between 40-60%, low hairpin melting temperature (Tm), low self- and hetero-dimerization Tm's.
