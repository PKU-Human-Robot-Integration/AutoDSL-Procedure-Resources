    "Ethics statement\nAll procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments. The design of this study was approved by the local ethics committee of the University Hospital of Bonn, Germany.\nNOTE: Ensure that subjects are in good and healthy condition, free of any anti-hypertensive medicine and at least 24 hours free of catecholamine inducing agents like caffeine or equal substances.\n1. Preparation of the Test Subject\nClean the skin of the forehead with 70% alcohol to degrease the skin prior to NIRS electrode positioning.\nPlace the NIRS electrode on the right forehead above the eyebrow and to the right of the midsagittal sulcus (locus frontopolar 2) to measure cerebral (=central) tissue oxygenation.\nEvaluate the stability of the signal. The rSO2-signal should be constant (± 3%) for at least 5 min.\nFor measuring peripheral tissue oxygenation with NIRS (NIRStissue-electrode), place one electrode above the middle of the musculus quadriceps femoris (alternatively on the forearm). Do not place the electrode above a venous plexus or an artery.\nPlace ECG-electrodes on the hair free chest. The ECG leads are marked with different letters. Place \"R\" on the sternocostal head of pectoralis major right, \"L\" on the sternocostal head of pectoralis major left, \"C\" on the fifth intercostal space middle of the medioclavicular line, \"F\" on the left lower rib edge, \"N\" on the right lower rib edge.\nMeasure peripheral pulse oximetry (SpO2) on a fingertip on the same extremity and side where the NIRStissue-electrode is placed.",
    "Measure noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) by using a blood pressure cuff. Use the contralateral extremity that allows peripheral pulse oximetry to be measured. In order to get a high time-resolution in blood pressure results, choose a one-minute interval for measuring. Choose NIBP by touching the screen and selecting \"settings\".\nAt least 20 min before the apnea, establish an intravenous line into the medial cubital vein of the right or left arm to draw blood samples at individual time points during and after apnea.\n\t\nClean the skin with 70% alcohol.\nUse a tourniquet to help the veins become more prominent.\nUse skin-disinfection to avoid infections and insert the needle through the skin.\nReduce the insertion angle after blood flashback at the catheter hub. Push the catheter into the vein.\nRemove the needle and flush catheter with sterile saline (NaCl 0.9%).\n2. Data Collection\nCalibrate the internal clock of all monitors in order to synchronize measurements for later processing.\n\t\nClick the bottom-right clock icon on the desktop, and tap \"change date and time settings\" in the pop-up window.\nPress the Settings menu button on the NIRS devise and change date and time via the menu.\nTo store physiological data for offline analysis, insert the monitor device into the docking station and connect it to the computer via the network cable. Ensure that the IP address and subnet mask of the docking station is correct in the network settings in order to get a connection. Contact device provider in order to get this information.\nUse a monitor device specific software to save measurements on the computer. Click \"start\" to begin recordings and save the results after the end of the measurement.\n\tNote: In some devices, data has to be saved live during the measurement.",
    "Note: For trouble-shooting take care of the following steps: If the variability of NIRStissue signals is too high, re-evaluate the position of the electrode (avoid bigger venous plexus or arteries directly under the electrodes). High variability of NIRScerebral signals can also be an indirect marker for hyperventilation of divers to reduce partial CO2. Instruct the subject to breath slower and with lower tidal-volumes and re-evaluate the signal. Subjects are allowed to take 3 deep inspirations before final apnea. Avoid including this period into the evaluation of baseline values. The first 30 sec after maximal inspiration are characterized by variable values. Do not use them for analysis.\n3. Apnea\nHave the subjects rest for at least 15 min in a lying position to avoid stress induced changes in blood circulation due to vasoconstriction. Have subjects breathe normally to avoid influences of hyperventilation caused vasoconstriction. Limit the breathing frequency to ≤ 15 breaths/min.\nDraw blood samples for baseline analysis. Discard the first 5 ml of drawn blood to avoid measurement uncertainty. Flush the catheter after each venous blood collection with sterile saline to prevent clotting.\nEnsure that monitor values are invisible to subjects to avoid visual influences to their apneic performance.\nCheck each device for functionality and signal quality. Ensure that electrodes cannot be removed by involuntary movements of the test subject at the end of apnea.\nConclude with clear agreements. Give a countdown of the last 2 min verbally. Subjects should breathe normally during this preparation time. Prior to the final breath 3 deep inspirations are allowed. Ask the subject to indicate the last inhalation by finger sign. Apnea should be performed as long as possible.\n\tNote: The end of the final breath indicates the start of apnea. The end of apnea is defined as the first inspiration after apnea.",
    "Mark important events (i.e., beginning and end of apnea) electronically to avoid inaccuracies in further time analysis by pressing the \"Event Mark Button\" on the NIRS device.\n\tNote: Movements of the chest and stomach induced by involuntary diaphragm activities are common in the second half of apnea and indicate the struggle phase.\nDraw blood samples at different time-points depending on the aim of the study.\nCentrifuge blood samples at 1,500 x g for 10 min. Take the supernatant and store it at -80 °C for future analysis.\n4. Processing Data\nProcessing data from the monitor device:\n\t\nOpen the saved file on the computer and press \"start\" to analyze data.\nClick \"review\" to get access to the trend monitor and select \"options\" and then \"tools\" in the MENU submask. Time interval can be changed via \"trend interval\" if necessary.\nSelect the mask \"trends\" and save. Open file \"trends\" in a spreadsheet program for further processing.\nProcessing data from NIRS device:\n\t\nOpen the software on the computer and connect the NIRS device via WIFI.\nTransfer the data from the NIRS device to the computer.\nSave the data in CSV-format.\nOpen file in a spreadsheet program for further processing.\n5. Analyze Values\nCreate a spreadsheet with both datasets to compare the values. Identify a time interval of at least 30 sec where NIRS-values and SpO2 are constant (± 3%). Take an average of these values to define a baseline-level.\n\tNote: Heart rate is known to change considerably prior to apnea. In order to conduct further analysis, a baseline heart rate is defined at a time point 30 sec after initiation of apnea.",
    "Find the start point of monotonic decrease in rSO2 and SpO2 during apnea by looking for a decrease of values > 2% compared to baseline-levels. This time point is defined as \"begin of desaturation\".\nIdentify the start point of rSO2 and SpO2 increase at the end of apnea as a monotonic increase of values after termination of apnea. This point is defined as \"begin of re-saturation\".\nCalculate the time difference between \"start of apnea\" and \"begin of desaturation\" and the time differences between \"end of apnea\" and \"begin of re-saturation\" for NIRScerebral, NIRStissue and SpO2. Save each difference in seconds on a separate spreadsheet.\nOptional: Calculate heart rate variability of each participant during the second and the last minute of apnea. This may reveal information about the sympathetic/parasympathetic balance during this stressful phase.\n6. Statistical Processing\nCompare the time differences between \"beginning of desaturation\" of SpO2, NIRScerebral, and NIRStissue values. Test for Gaussian distribution of the measurement differences (e.g., using Shapiro-Wilk normality test for sample sizes smaller than 50).\nIf the distribution of the measurement differences is significantly different from normal distribution, use Wilcoxon signed rank test. If normal distribution can be assumed, consider using paired t-test.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
