Add 1 μl of various concentrations of adriamycin or cisplatin into each well of the 96-well assay plate containing the cells, and shake the 96-well plate horizontally to mix the drugs (do not need to change the medium).   Incubate the cells for 72 h in a humidified incubator (at 37 °C, 5% CO2).   Thaw the CellTiter 96® AQueous One solution reagent.
