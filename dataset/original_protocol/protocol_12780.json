    "1. Preparation of Lysis Plates\nUsing a RNA/DNA free bench, prepare enough lysis buffer for 96 wells, with 10% extra, by mixing 390 µL nuclease free water, 17 µL of 10% NP-40, 2.8 µL 10 mM dNTP, 10 µL 0.1 M DTT and 5.3 µL RNAse inhibitor (see Table of Materials). Vortex and spin down.\nDistribute 4 µL of lysis buffer to each well of a 96 well PCR plate and seal the plates with adhesive film. Spin down tubes to collect liquid at the bottom of the plates. Keep plates on ice until cell sorting (maximum 24 h).\n2. Preparation of Cells for Cell Sorting\nThaw appropriate number of cells (here, CD34 enriched hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells) for the experiment. 1 x 106 cells are appropriate for sorting approximately three 96-well plates of single-cells with controls.\nTransfer thawed cells to a 15 mL conical tube and add 1 mL FBS every 30 s until a total volume of 8 mL is reached. Spin cells in a centrifuge at 350 x g for 10 min at 4 °C and remove supernatant.\nResuspend cells in 8 mL staining buffer (PBS with 2% FBS) and centrifuge at 350 x g for 10 min at 4 °C and remove supernatant.\nResuspend cells in 200 µL staining buffer and remove cells for control stains.\nMake Fluorescence minus one controls (FMOs) for each fluorophore, by staining a fraction of cells in 50 µL staining buffer. In this example, 6 microcentrifuge tubes with 20,000 cells are used as FMOSs. Note that the number of cells should be adjusted depending on the population investigated. Add all antibodies at the same concentration as in the sample stain except for one to each tube.",
    "Make single stains for each fluorophore by staining a fraction of cells in 50 µL buffer for each fluorophore used. In this example 6 microcentrifuge tubes with 20,000 cells are used. Note that the target for each antibody needs to be expressed by the cells used for controls. Add each antibody at the same concentration as in the sample stain in individual tubes. Additionally keep 20,000 unstained cells in 50 µL as an unstained control.\nTo the cell sample, add antibodies at their appropriate concentration. Used here are CD34-FITC at a 1/100 concentration, CD38-APC 1/50, CD90-PE 1/10, CD45RA-bv421 1/50, CD49F-PECy7 1/50 and Lineage Mix: CD3-PECy5 1/50, CD2-PECy5 1/50, CD19-PECy5 1/50, CD56-PECy5 1/50, CD123-PECy5 1/50, CD14-PECy5 1/50, CD16-PECy5 1/50, and CD235a-PECy5 1/1000.\nIncubate cells with antibodies for 30 min on ice in the dark.\nWash cells with 3 mL staining buffer. Centrifuge cells at 350 x g for 10 min at 4 °C and remove supernatant.\nResuspend cells and repeat step 2.9.\nResuspend sample in 500 µL and FMOs in 100 µL staining buffer with 1/100 7AAD and filter cells through a 50 µm filter to get a single-cell suspension.\n3. Cell Sorting\nMake sure that the FACS machine is set up correctly with drop delay and cytometer setup and tracking (CST) that have recently been performed according to manufacturer's instructions, to ensure that the appropriate cells are sorted. For hematopoietic cells, the use of the 85 micron nozzle and maximum speed of 4 is recommended, while the optimal event rate is between 800 and 2000 events/s.\nCorrect for spectral overlap by performing fluorescence compensation and set gates according to FMO controls or internal negative controls.",
    "Perform reanalysis of the target population by sorting at least 100 target cells into a new microcentrifuge tube with 100 µL of stain buffer. FACS analyze the sorted cells by recording the sorted sample and make sure that they end up in the sort gate.\nSet-up single cell plate sorting by centering the drop in well A1 in a 96 well plate. When it is centered, sort 50–100 6 µm particles into all wells around the edge of an empty 96 well plate to ensure that all wells will get a cell in the center of each well.\nIf possible, an additional control to ensure that viable cells are sorted can be added by sorting single-cells for in vitro growth. Haematopoietic cells can be grown in U-bottom 96 well plates in 100 µl SFEM with 1% penicillin streptomycin, 100 ng/mL FLT3L, TPO and SCF. Analyze each well after 3 days in culture for cell colonies using a microscope.\nRemove adhesive film from plates. Sort a single cell of interest (here Lin-CD34+CD38- cells) into 92 out of the 96 wells, activate INDEX-sorting in the FACS sorting software to save the immunophenotypic profile for other markers of interest (here CD45RA, CD49f, and CD90) for each single cell.\nSort two wells with 10 and 20 cells respectively for linearity controls in the PCR amplification. Wells H1 and H2 are usually used.\nKeep two wells without any cells as no-template controls, usually wells H3 and H4.\nSeal the plates with clear adhesive film and spin the plates at 300 x g for 1 min before snap freezing on dry ice.\nStore frozen plates at -80 °C.\n\tNOTE: Safe stopping point. Sorted and lysed cells can be kept at -80 °C for long-term storage.\n4. Reverse Transcription and Specific Target Amplification",
    "Prepare the primer mix for all 96 gene targets by adding 2 µL of each primer pair, including housekeeping gene primers and primers for spiked-in control RNA, in a 1.5 mL RNAse free tube on a RNA/DNA free bench. If using less than 96 primers, add an equivalent volume of nuclease free water for the missing primers. Primers are ordered separately to match the desired gene panel.\nMake reverse transcription and specific target amplification mix by adding 632.5 µL 2x reaction mix, 101.2 µL Taq/SuperscriptIII, 151.8 µL Primer mix, and 0.7 µL spiked in control RNA. Preform this step on a DNA free bench. Mix by vortexing and spin down to collect the liquid in the bottom of the tube. Keep on ice until addition to the sample.\nMake no-reverse transcription control mix for four wells by mixing 27.5 µL of 2x reaction mix, 1.76 µL of Taq enzyme, 6.6 µL of primer mix and 2.64 µL of nuclease free water. Spike in control RNA. Perform this step on a DNA free bench. Vortex and spin down to collect the liquid in the bottom of the tube and keep on ice until addition to sample.\nThaw lysate plates on ice. Add 8.75 µL of the previously prepared reverse transcription and specific target amplification mix to 92 wells, including the linearity and no-template controls. Add 8.75 µL of no-reverse transcription control mix to the four remaining wells. Seal plates with clear adhesive film and spin down to collect liquid at the bottom of the plates.",
    "Preform reverse transcription and specific target amplification by running the plate in a PCR machine according to the preamp program; step 1: 50 °C for 60 min, step 2: 95 °C for 2 min, step 3: 95 °C for 15 s, step 4: 60 °C for 4 min, repeat steps 3–4 24 times and finally step 5: 8 °C forever.\nAfter PCR is complete, keep the plate at 8 °C for short term storage and -20 °C for long term storage.\n\tNOTE: Safe stopping point. Amplified material can be kept at 8 °C for short-term storage and at -20 °C for long-term storage.\n5. Preparation of Sample and Assay Plates for Multiplex Microfluidic Gene Expression Analysis\nPrepare assay loading plate by pipetting 3 µL Assay loading reagent to each well of a 96 well plate. Add 3 µL of each primer to individual wells in the assay loading plate.\nSeal plate with adhesive film and spin down to collect liquid at the bottom of the plates.\nPrepare dilution plate by pipetting 8 µL of nuclease free water into all wells of a 96 well plate. Add 2 µL of amplified sample to the dilution plate, making a final dilution of 1:5.\nSeal plate with adhesive film, mix by vortexing plate for 10 s, and finally spin down to collect liquid at the bottom of the plates.\nPrepare sample loading mix by carefully mixing 352 µL of master mix with 35.2 µL of sample loading reagent.

    "6. Loading of Microfluidic Chip\nTake out a new 96 x 96 microfluidic chip. Prepare inlets by poking them with a syringe with cap on to make sure that they can be moved.\nRemove bubbles from syringes. Add full volume of syringes to each valve while tilting the chip 45 degrees and pressing down the valve. Prime chip with the IFC controller.\nLoad each assay inlet with 4.25 µL from each of the wells in the assay loading plate. Avoid bubbles. If bubbles appear in the well, remove them with a pipette tip.\nContinue loading each sample inlet with 4.25 µL from each of the wells in the sample loading plate, avoid bubbles, and if bubbles appear, remove them with pipette tip.\nLoad chip with the IFC controller.\nCheck that the chip looks even and that all chambers have been loaded. Remove dust from the chip surface by touching it with tape. Run the chip in the multiplex microfluidic gene expression platform.\n7. Running Chip on Multiplex Microfluidic Gene Expression Platform\nAfter loading chip into the multiplex microfluidic gene expression platform, name the sample.\nSet ROX as passive dye. Set single probe and FAM-MGB as fluorescence. Use 96 x 96 standard v2 as protocol. Start run.\nRemove chip when run is complete.\n8. Preliminary Analysis of Chip Run\nLoad data into Real-Time PCR analysis software.\nLoad gene names and cell names by pasting cell and gene layouts from a tab delimited file.\nOpen image view and select ROX as dye. Check if all wells have ROX passive dye.\nInvestigate if all amplification plots look ok, with a smooth amplification curve with no spikes (similar to Figure 3E).\nEnsure that all single-cells have expression of spiked-in control RNA to make sure that all have been loaded properly.",
    "Ensure that all cells have housekeeping gene expression and thus have been sorted properly.\nEnsure that 10 and 20 cell linearity controls have approximately 1 CT difference to validate linear amplification.\nCheck if there is expression in the noRT control samples. If expression is detected in noRT consider changing probes to probes which do not detect genomic DNA for subsequent runs.\nExport data in csv files for further analysis.\n9. Single-cell Analysis Using SCExV\nNOTE: An introductory film is present20 to introduce the tool. Here, a short recommendation of how to do analysis using the controls introduced in the protocol is presented.\nConnect to the SCexV website20.\nUpload exported CSV files.\nChose the spiked-in control RNA as positive control. Remove any cell which has a control RNA CT above 25. Normalize the data to median expression of control RNA.\nClick \"Done here -> Analyze\". Remove noRT, notemplate, 10 and 20 cell controls in the exclude cell option.\nCluster cells with the clustering approach of choice with the expected number of clusters. Export analyzed values.\n10. Index-sorting Analysis\nOpen FACS analysis software and load the indexed samples.\nOpen the script editor and run the script available from Quinn J. et al.21\nNow that the FACS analysis software should have made a gate for each of the single cells, open layout editor and color the cells according to the grouping from SCexV (available in the file named \"Sample_complete_Data.xls\").\nSubscription Required.
