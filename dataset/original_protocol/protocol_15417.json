    "1. Growth of 13C, 15N-labeled Aspergillus fumigatus Liquid Medium\nPreparation of unlabeled and 13C, 15N-labeled growth medium\n\tNOTE: Both Yeast Extract Peptone Dextrose medium (YPD) and the improved minimal medium43 were used for the maintenance of fungal culture. All steps after autoclaving are performed in a laminar flow hood to minimize contamination.\n\t\nPreparation of unlabeled liquid medium: Dissolve 6.5 g of YPD powder in 100 mL of distilled water and then autoclave for 25 min at 134 °C.\nPreparation of unlabeled solid medium\n\t\t\nAdd 1.5 g of agar and 6.5 g of YPD powder in 100 mL of distilled water.\nAutoclave the medium for 25 min at 121 °C and then cool down to approximately 50 °C.\nTransfer 13-15 mL of the medium into each pre-sterile plastic Petri dish and cover the dish using a lid immediately.\nPreparation of 13C, 15N-labeled liquid medium\n\t\tNOTE: To prepare the growth solution for isotope labeling, a minimal medium containing 13C-glucose and 15N-sodium nitrate and a trace-element solution are prepared separately and then mixed before use.\n\t\t\nPrepare 100 mL of the isotope-containing minimal medium as listed in Table 1. Adjust the pH to 6.6 using NaOH (1 M) or HCl (1M) solution.\nAutoclave the minimal medium for 25 min at 121 °C.\nPrepare 100 mL (1,000x) of trace elements solution, dissolve the salts listed in Table 2 in the distilled water. Autoclave the solution for 25 min at 134 °C. Cool down and store the solution at 4 °C for short-term use. The pH will be about 6.5 and can be checked using a pH meter.\nAdd 0.1 mL of trace elements solution to 100 mL of 13C, 15N-labeled minimal medium as listed in Table 2 before use.\nGrowth of the fungal materials",
    "Transfer a small amount of fungi from the storage onto a YPD plate using an inoculating loop in a laminar flow hood. Keep the culture at 30 °C for 2 days in an incubator.\nUse an inoculating loop to transfer an active growing fungal edge to the 13C,15N-labeling solution in a laminar flow hood. Keep the culture at 30 °C for 3-5 days at 220 rpm in a shaking incubator.\nCentrifuge at 4,000 x g for 20 min. Remove the supernatant and collect the pellet.\nUse a tweezer to collect ~0.5 g of well-hydrated pellet (>50 wt% hydration) for NMR studies. Loss of hydration at any point will substantially worsen the spectral resolution.\n\t\tNOTE: If needed, a small amount (0.1 g) of the hydrated mycelia can be separated and fully dried under N2 gas flow in a hood or a lyophilizer to estimate the hydration level and calculate the dry mass percentage. Usually, a pellet containing ~0.3 g dry mass can be obtained after 3 days. If the NMR experiment to be conducted is long (>7 days) and/or if the state of the fungi needs to be fixed, the fungal material can be deeply frozen in liquid N2 for 10-20 min before further processing. If the experiment will be short (3-6 days), the freezing can be skipped so that the sample can remain fresh.\nMix the excess material with 20% (v/v) of glycerol in a centrifuge tube and keep it in a -80 ᵒC freezer for long-term storage.\n2. Preparation of A. fumigatus for Solid-state NMR and DNP Studies\nPreparation of A. fumigatus for solid-state NMR experiments",
    "Dialyze the 13C, 15N-labeled fungal sample (Step 1.2.4.) against 1 L of 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) at 4°C using a dialysis bag with a 3.5 kDa molecular weight cutoff to remove small molecules from the growth medium for a total period of 3 days. Change the buffer twice daily.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, the sample could be washed for 6-10 times using deionized water to remove residual small molecules.\nTransfer the sample into a 15 mL tube and centrifuge for 5 min (10,000 x g) using a benchtop centrifuge. Remove the supernatant and collect the remaining fungal materials.\nPack 70-80 mg of the uniformly 13C-labeled and well-hydrated sample paste into a 4-mm ZrO2 rotor or 30-50 mg to 3.2 mm rotors for NMR experiments. Repetitively squeeze the sample gently using a metal rod and absorb the excess water using paper.\nTightly cap the rotor and insert the sample into the spectrometer for solid-state NMR characterization.\n\t\tNOTE: The brand-new rotors are suggested to minimize the possibility of rotor crash and sample spill in the NMR spectrometer. If needed, a disposable Kel-F insert with sealing screws can be used to serve as a secondary container inside the rotor.\nPreparation of A. fumigatus samples for DNP experiments\n\t\nPrepare 100 µL of DNP solvents29,44 (also known as the DNP matrix) in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube for 13C,15N-labeled fungal samples. This DNP matrix contains a mixture of d8-glycerol/D2O/H2O (60/30/10 Vol%).\n\t\tNOTE: If unlabeled samples are to be investigated, then prepare the DNP matrix using 13C-depleted d8-glycerol (12C3, 99.95%; D8, 98%) and D2O and H2O to avoid 13C signal contribution from the solvents.\nDissolve 0.7 mg of AMUPol45 in 100 µL of DNP solvents to form 10 mM radical stock solution. Vortex for 2-3 min to ensure that radicals are fully dissolved in the solution.",
    "Soak 10 mg of the dialyzed 13C, 15N-labeled fungal materials as described in prior steps (Steps 2.1.1 and 2.1.2) into 50 µL of AMUPol solution, and mildly grind the mixture using a pestle and a mortar to ensure penetration of the radicals into the porous cell walls.\n\t\tNOTE: To reduce the rate of hydration loss, the grinding can also take place in a microcentrifuge tube using a micropestle.\nAdd another 30 µL of the radical solution to the grinded pellet to further hydrate the fungal sample.\nPack the pellet into a 3.2-mm sapphire rotor, squeeze mildly and remove the excess DNP solvent. Add a 3.2-mm silicone plug to prevent the loss of hydration. Typically, 5-30 mg of sample can be packed to the rotor. The exact amount needs to be determined by the sensitivity requirement of the NMR experiments to be conducted.\nInsert and spin up the sample in a DNP spectrometer, measure a DNP-enhanced spectrum under microwave irradiation and compare it with the microwave-off spectrum. This will lead to an enhancement factor εon/off, which should be 20-40 for these complex materials. Run the designed experiments to determine cell wall structure.\n3. Preparation of Plant Biomass for NMR and DNP Studies\nPreparation of plant materials for solid-state NMR\n\t\nProduce uniformly 13C-labeled plants in-house using 13CO2 supplies in a growth chamber or 13C-glucose medium as described previously46,47 or directly purchase labeled materials from isotope-labeling companies.\n\t\tNOTE: 13C-glucose can only be used in dark growth to avoid the introduction of 12C by photosynthesis.\nCut the uniformly 13C labeled plant material into small pieces (typically 1-2 mm in dimension) using a laboratory razor blade.\n\t\tNOTE: Depending on the purpose, the extracted cell walls are sometimes used for structural characterization and the detailed protocols are reported in previous studies21,46.",
    "If the sample was previously dried, add 100 µL of water to 30 mg of plant materials in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, vortex, equilibrate at room temperature for 1 day. Centrifuge at 4,000 x g for 10 min and remove the excess water using a pipette.\nIf the sample was never-dried at any point, directly use the sample without further treatment.\nPack the resulting plant materials into 3.2-mm or 4-mm ZrO2 rotors for solid-state NMR experiments.\nPreparation of plant materials for DNP studies\n\t\nPrepare 60 µL stock solution of 10 mM AMUPol radical as described steps 2.2.1 and 2.2.2.\nCut the uniformly 13C labeled plant material to be studied into small pieces (1-2 mm in dimension) using a laboratory razor blade and weigh 20 mg of the plant materials.\nHand-grind the plant pieces into small particles (~1-2 mm in size) using a mortar and pestle. The final powders have a homogenous appearance.\nAdd 40 µL of the DNP stock solution prepared in prior step (Step 2.2.2) to the plant material and grind mildly for 5 min to ensure homogeneous mixing with the radical.\nAdd another 20 µL of the stock solution to further hydrate the plant material after grinding.\nPack the equilibrated plant sample into a 3.2-mm sapphire rotor for DNP experiments. Insert a silicone plug to avoid the loss of hydration.\n4. Standard Solid-State NMR Experiments for Initial Characterization of Carbohydrate-Rich Biomaterials\nNOTE: A brief overview of the NMR experiments is provided in this section. However, structural elucidation typically requires extensive expertise. Therefore, collaborative efforts with NMR spectroscopists is recommended.",
    "Measure 1D 13C Cross Polarization (CP), 13C Direct Polarization (DP) with 2-s and 35-s recycle delays, and 1H-13C INEPT48,49 spectra to obtain a general understanding of the dynamical distribution of cell components (Figure 1a). The cell walls are typically the relatively rigid portion and exhibit dominant signals in the CP spectrum.\nMeasure a series of standard 2D 13C-13C correlation experiments for resonance assignments of 13C signals. Start with refocused INADEQUATE50,51 to obtain carbon connectivity, which need to be assisted by a series of through-space experiments such as 1.5-ms RFDR52 (Figure 1b) and 50-ms CORD/DARR53 experiments.\n\tNOTE: If it is of interest to find a sample rich in a specific component, for example, the primary or secondary cell walls, then multiple segments or multiple plants may need to be measured separately to find the sample with the optimal composition.\nConduct 2D 15N-13C correlation experiments which can be measured to facilitate the resonance assignments of proteins and nitrogenated carbohydrates.\n\tNOTE: The resonance assignment is typically time-consuming. A method is currently being developed to facilitate the resonance assignment of carbohydrate signals for those scientists without prior experience.\nMeasure more specialized experiments to determine the spatial proximities (Figure 1c, d), hydration and mobilities of complex biomolecules to determine the three-dimensional structure of the carbohydrate-rich materials as systematically described previously22,29.\nSubscription Required.
