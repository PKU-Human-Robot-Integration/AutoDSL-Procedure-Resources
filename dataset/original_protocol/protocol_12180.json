    "All research involving vertebrate animals was performed in accordance with protocols approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n1. Culture Media Preparation\nPrepare α-MEM by dissolving minimum essential medium (MEM) powder and 1.9 g sodium bicarbonate in 900 ml H2O and supplement with 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 ml heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Sterilize using a 0.22 µm polyethersulfone (PES) filter.\nPrepare macrophage medium by supplementing α-MEM with 35 ng/ml recombinant mouse Macrophage-Colony Stimulating Factor (M-CSF)\nPrepare osteoclast medium by supplementing macrophage medium with 100 ng/ml RANKL\n2. Bone Marrow Cell Isolation\nFill one 10 ml syringe with a 25⅝ gauge needle per mouse with 10 ml α-MEM.\nEuthanize mice via 10 min exposure to CO2 at a flow rate of 1.3 L/min. Ensure animal death by following CO2 exposure with cervical dislocation before proceeding with dissection.\nUsing clean technique, dissect out and separate the tibiae and femora. Disinfect mouse skin with 70 % ethanol before making an incision along the anterior surface of each hind limb to expose the tibia and femur.\nCut through the knee joint to free the distal end of the femur, and cut through the femur as close to the pelvis as possible. Remove the femur and clean as much soft tissue as possible. To remove the tibia, cut through the ankle and remove as much soft tissue as possible.\nHold the bone with forceps and flush marrow into a 15 ml conical tube with 2.5 ml room temperature α-MEM combining marrow flushes from a single mouse into a single tube.\n\tNOTE: A successful marrow flush will change the coloration of the bone from red to beige.",
    "Allow debris to settle to the bottom of the tube and transfer supernatant to a clean 15 ml conical tube taking care to avoid transferring any debris.\n\tNOTE: Some cells may also settle with the marrow debris. If a greater number of cells is required, marrow flushes can be filtered through a 70 µm cell strainer into a clean 15 ml tube.\nCentrifuge tube(s) at 300 x g for 5min at room temperature to pellet cells.\nVacuum aspirate the supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in 0.5 ml Ammonium-Chloride-Potassium (ACK) lysing buffer and incubate at 37 °C for 3 min to lyse red blood cells.\nAdd 10 ml PBS directly to ACK-cell solution, and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min.\n\tNOTE: The previously red cell pellet should now be beige.\nVacuum aspirate supernatant and resuspend pellet in 10 ml α-MEM, and plate in a 100 mm tissue culture-treated dish. Incubate cells overnight at 37 °C in a humidified tissue culture incubator.\n\tNOTE: Counting cells is not necessary for this step. During this time, adherent cells from the bone marrow will attach to the culture surface; non-adherent bone marrow cell populations will remain in suspension. MCSF is not present in the culture medium during this initial incubation.\n3. Enrichment of Osteoclast Precursors\nAfter overnight incubation of marrow flushes, transfer culture supernatant containing non-adherent cells to a 50 ml conical tube.\n\tNOTE: Culture dishes with adherent cells, which include bone marrow mesenchymal progenitor cells, can be discarded or fed with fresh α-MEM, if desired for other experiments.\n\tNOTE: Osteoclasts can be differentiated directly from these non-adherent bone marrow cells by plating them into tissue culture-treated dishes at a density of 4 x 105 cells/cm2 in osteoclast medium and refreshing medium every other day for 5 days.",
    "Add α-MEM to non-adherent cell solution to a final volume of 18 ml and add M-CSF to a final concentration of 35 ng/ml.\nAdd 3 ml of cell suspension each to 6 60 mm suspension culture dishes.\nIncubate plates overnight at 37 °C in a humidified tissue culture incubator. During this time, M-CSF will stimulate differentiation of macrophages, which can adhere even to non-tissue culture-treated surfaces.\nAfter incubating overnight, re-feed osteoclast precursors with 3 ml fresh macrophage medium. This will remove non-adherent cells that haven't differentiated into macrophages.\nContinue to culture osteoclast precursors at 37 °C and 5 % CO2 for 2 days or until cultures reach roughly 70% confluence.\n4. Osteoclast Differentiation\nWash osteoclast precursors with 5 ml PBS and treat cells with 1 ml marine-origin proteolytic/collagenolytic enzyme at room temperature until the cells can be dislodged by gentle tapping of the plate.\n\tNOTE: Osteoclast precursors can only be lifted if they are cultured in suspension dishes; precursors attach too firmly to tissue culture-treated surfaces to be lifted. Trypsin can activate osteoclast precursors and should be avoided.\nAdd 4 ml α-MEM to each dish and transfer cells to a 50 ml conical tube. Count cells using a hemocytometer and dilute cells to a density of 5 x 104 cells/ml and add M-CSF to a final concentration of 35 ng/ml and RANKL to a final concentration of 100 ng/ml.\nSeed cells at a density of 2.6 x 104 cells/cm2 into tissue culture-treated plates and incubate at 37 °C in a humidified tissue culture incubator for 2 days. Differentiation is typically carried out in 24-well plates, where 5 x 104 cells are seeded into each well.\n2 days after the start of the differentiation, re-feed cells by replacing medium with 1 ml fresh osteoclast medium.",
    "NOTE: Osteoclast differentiation will usually be complete within 3 days. Resulting osteoclasts can be TRAP-stained for easy quantification and morphological analysis.\n5. Continuous Stimulation of Notch Signaling with Jagged1-coated Surface\nSuspend goat anti-human IgG Fc antibody in PBS at a concentration of 10 μg/ml (1:1,000 dilution of 10 mg/ml stock). Add antibody solution to culture surface at a density of 1.3 μg/cm2 and incubate at room temperature for 1 hr. In the case of 24-well plates, add 250 μl (2.5 μg) per well.\nVacuum aspirate wells and refill with 1 ml PBS. Repeat this step 2 times.\nSuspend recombinant Jagged1-Fc fusion protein in PBS at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. Add Jagged1-FC solution to the antibody-coated culture surface at a density of 1.3 μg/cm2 and incubate at room temperature for 2 hr. Culture surfaces coated with antibody only can be used as controls.\nVacuum aspirate wells and refill with 1 ml PBS. Repeat this step 2 times. Keep PBS in wells until just prior to cell seeding to prevent them from drying.\nSeed 2.6 x 104 osteoclast precursors/cm2 onto coated surfaces. Notch signaling will be continuously stimulated for at least 3 days.\n6. Temporary Stimulation of Notch Signaling with Jagged1-coated Beads\nCombine the following in an appropriately sized tube: 0.5 μg/cm2 Jagged1-Fc, 21 μl/cm2 protein G agarose beads, and PBS to a final volume of 1.5 ml. To prepare an adequate number of Jagged1 beads for 1 well of a 24 well plate, combine 1 μg Jagged1-Fc, 40 μl protein G agarose beads, and PBS to 1.5 ml.\nIncubate tube with rotation at 4 °C for 2 hr.\nCentrifuge tube at 300 x g for 1 min to pellet beads. Resuspend beads in 1.5 ml PBS. Repeat this wash 2 more times.",
    "Resuspend Jagged1 beads in 130 μl/cm2 culture medium and apply to cultured cells.\nIncubate cells with beads at 37 °C and 5 % CO2 for desired period. Remove beads with several washes of PBS or culture medium.\nVerify Notch signaling activation via measurement of Notch target gene transcripts10.\nSubscription Required.
