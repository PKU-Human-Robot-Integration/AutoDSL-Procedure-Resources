  "procedures": [
    "The procedure described here was approved by the VA Puget Sound Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and complies with the ILAR Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n1. Experimental Preparation\nDecide beforehand if blood or tissue collection soon after exercise is necessary, and if so, determine the post-exercise interval for conduction of such procedures. Examples include determination of exercise induced hormone or cytokine release into the circulation (necessitating blood collection), determination of exercise induced expression of mRNA species of interest (necessitating euthanasia followed by tissue collection). If immediate post exercise blood or tissue collection is indicated, have materials for these procedures on hand in the procedure room. Receive institutional review board approval and perform according to regulatory guidelines. Not all experiments require postexercise blood or tissue collection; a simple comparison of running endurance may be all that is needed.\nDecide in advance on experimental groups and postexercise procedures for mice (see description above).\nPlace the treadmill on a sturdy table in a quiet room dedicated during the running trials to this procedure.\nSet the treadmill for mouse-sized lanes and at an inclination appropriate to the protocol. The inclination of +5o is used here to obviate muscle damage due to eccentric exercise (lengthening the muscle at the same time as contraction) that occurs during downhill running.\nPlace an absorbent pad below the treadmill belt to catch feces.\n2. Acclimation of Mice to the Treadmill",
    "Decide if a “sedentary” (no exercise) group of mice is necessary, and expose sedentary mice to the treadmill without running as outlined in Steps 2.1 - 2.5. Determine if 2 or 4 experimental groups are required, e.g., Sedentary/Exercise (2 groups); Exercised Controls/Exercised Treatment (2 groups, no sedentary animals); or, Sedentary/Exercised x Control/Treatment (4 groups). The “treatment” may be a transgenic or knockout genotype, a pharmacological regimen, special diet, or other experimental intervention.\nAllow the mouse to acclimate to the procedure room in its transported home cage, with cage mates, for 1 - 2 hr.\nSelect a single mouse and record tag number; weigh mouse and record weight.\nPlace mouse in the treadmill without the motor turned on for acclimation, about 5 min. Turn power on, without the treadmill belt running, and let the mouse acclimate to the machine noise for another 5 min.\nRemove mice in the “sedentary” groups (if used; see Note 1) from the treadmill at this point and return them to their cage or conduct post-exercise procedures as per the experimental design (see Note 2).\n3. Starting the Run-to-Exhaustion test\nAfter acclimation, turn the belt to a low speed (10 m/min) when the animal is exploring the belt and not on the platform.\nGently tap or lift the hindquarters of the mouse with a tongue depressor, one to three times, to encourage reluctant animals to stay on the treadmill and run.\n\tNOTE: Most mice will run readily, but they sometimes stop for short periods. When this occurs, use the tongue depressor to gently tap or lift the rear of the animal to encourage resumption of running. Often, the mice do not need to be touched with the tongue depressor; noticing the hand with the tongue depressor coming towards them causes the mice to run some more.",
    "Start a laboratory timer once the mouse is running at the initial speed of 10 m/min.\nTurn the speed up slowly when the mouse is at the top (uphill end) of the belt, at increments of 1 m/min, about every 2 min.\nTurn the speed down to the previous setting if the mouse repeatedly runs in short bursts and not at a steady pace.\nDetermine the maximal sustained running speed of each mouse (usually 14 - 17 m/min for C57BL/6 mice) by adjusting the speed and watching the mouse. Record this speed.\n\tNOTE: The location of the animal on the treadmill cues the investigator as to the willingness of the animal to run at a higher speed. If the mouse is at the far (uphill) end and about to run into the wall, it is ready to run at a higher speed. If the mouse is running at a steady pace in the middle of the treadmill it may be at its maximal speed, or may need further adjustment, depending on the quality of the run.\n4. Endpoints and Mice that Stop\nUse the tongue depressor to gently tap or lift the hindquarters of the animals that stop, to encourage resumption of running (see Note 3.2). Do not stop the timer for temporary interruptions in running.\nIdentify and remove mice that refuse to run . Note this on the data sheet. Depending on your experimental design, mice that refuse can be retested on a different day",
    "NOTE: Some mice will completely refuse to run. Such mice will run in short bursts, then stop to groom or “pedal”, that is, sit on the platform and use their front legs on the belt. The posture of these mice is hunched, with all four feet planted under the animal to keep from being pushed back onto the treadmill by the tongue depressor. Occasionally a mouse becomes aggressive towards the tongue depressor when unwilling to run, biting the tongue depressor or climbing up it as a way of escape. It is clear within the first 5 min of the trial whether the mouse will, or will not, run. Remove mice that refuse to run from the analysis, but do not count them as “sedentary” mice.\nIdentify exhausted mice and stop the timer.\n\tNOTE: Exhaustion is defined by three successive stops and refusal to resume running despite gentle encouragement, plus physical signs of exhaustion such as labored breathing and splayed posture. Mice recover from exhaustion within 30 to 60 min.\nRecord the total amount of time spent running at all speeds.\nDepending on the experimental design, either return the mouse is to its cage, or conduct immediate postexercise procedures such as blood or tissue collection as per institutional guidelines.\nWipe the belt clean with a germicidal towelette after testing each individual mouse so that the scent of the previous mouse does not influence behavior of subsequent mice tested.\nTest the next mouse. Use a fresh tongue depressor for each mouse. Mice that reside in the same cage can be tested sequentially on the same day without additional acclimation to the procedure room.\nSubscription Required.
