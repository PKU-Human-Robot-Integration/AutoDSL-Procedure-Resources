Human iPSCs are cultured under feeder-free conditions and passaged at least once before starting GPCs differentiation to ensure cells are in an active growth phase before starting differentiation.\nThaw iPSC lines.\nPrepare Matrigel-coated plates as described before and warm DMEM/F-12 and mTeSR1 media.\nPrepare 15 mL centrifuge tubes containing 12 mL DMEM/F-12 (1 tube per vial with 1 × 106 cells to be thawed) for cell wash.\nPrepare mTeSR1 ROCK inhibitor medium by adding 10 μM Y-27632 (1:1,000 dilution of stock solution); 2 mL/well of a 6-well plate are needed.\nCollect vials to be thawed on dry ice from cryostorage. Immediately transfer vials to a 37°C water bath.\nRemove vial from water bath before thawing is complete, when approximately half of the content is still frozen.\nGently add 500 μL of warm DMEM/F-12 using a 5 mL pipet, pipet up and down and when completely thawed, transfer to a centrifuge tube containing 12 mL DMEM/F-12 medium.\nCentrifuge at 200 g, 5 min at room temperature.\nGently aspirate supernatant leaving approximately 100 μL of media in the bottom of the tube, gently flick with finger to resuspend cell pellet.\nAspirate Matrigel solution from 6-well plates. No washing is required before plating the cells.\nGently add 2 mL of mTeSR1 ROCK inhibitor medium to resuspended cells and transfer entire volume to 1 well of 6-well plate.\nPlace plate in the incubator; gently shake the plate side to side and back and forth for a homogeneous distribution of the cells.\nThe next day, replace media with 2 mL of fresh mTeSR1 to remove ROCK inhibitor Y-27632.",
    "Colonies should appear within one week.\nCritical: Do not thaw completely the cells in the water bath to avoid cell death.\nCritical: Complete removal of DMSO present in storage media by washing is very important due to its toxicity.\nCritical: For media changes, always pipet carefully close to the wall of the wells to avoid detaching the cells.\nNote: The use of ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 increases viability.\nNote: Matrigel can be replaced by other extracellular matrices; we used Cultrex (R&D Systems, 3433-005-01) with similar results. mTeSR plus (Stem Cell, cat#100-0276) can replace mTeSR1 medium for growth and maintenance of iPSCs.\nTroubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: If experiencing low viability thawing cells to 12-well is recommended.\nMaintenance of iPSC cultures.\nChange mTeSR1 medium completely every day; this provides growth factors that reduce spontaneous differentiation.\nNote: You can double feed once a week.\nPassage of iPSC colonies.\nWhen colonies cover 80%–90% of the plate they are ready to be passaged.\nPrepare Matrigel-coated plates as described before and warm DMEM/F-12 and mTeSR1 media and PBS.\nPrepare collagenase IV medium by adding 1 mg/mL collagenase IV to DMEM/F-12 (1:10 dilution of stock solution); 1 mL/well of a 6-well plate is needed.\nMark on the plate differentiated cells for removal using a microscope.\nWash 1× with 3 mL warm PBS.\nAdd 1 mL of collagenase IV medium per well of a 6-well plate and incubate 15 min in the 37°C incubator; at this point the edges of the colonies start curling up and are ready to be detached.\nWash 2× with 3 mL of warm DMEM/F-12 medium.\nRemove the differentiated cells with a plastic tip.\nWash 1× with 3 mL of warm DMEM/F-12 medium.",
    "Add 1 mL mTeSR1 medium per well and gently scrap the cells using a cell lifter; stop once the cells are detached from the plate to keep small colonies and avoid dissociation into single cells.\nResuspend in sufficient mTeSR1 medium (2 mL/well) to replate at 1:4–6 on 6-well Matrigel-coated plates.\nPlace plate in the incubator; gently shake the plate side to side and back and forth for a homogeneous distribution of the cells.\nCritical: Cells should remain in small colonies when passaged; single iPS cells have lower viability.\nAlternatives: ReLeSR reagent (STEMCELL, cat. #05872) and gentle dissociation can be used to passage iPSCs.\nGPCs differentiation and culture\nTiming: 5–6 weeks\nThis step describes differentiation of iPSCs into GPCs using embryoid bodies (EBs) patterning, as well as expansion of GPC lines and cryopreservation.\nGPCs generation from iPSCs.\nGrow iPSCs in mTeSR1 medium on 3 wells of 6-well Matrigel-coated plates until 80% confluent.\nWarm DMEM/F-12 for wash.\nPrepare collagenase IV medium by adding 1 mg/mL collagenase IV to DMEM/F12 (1:10 dilution of stock solution); 1 mL/well of a 6-well plate is needed.\nPrepare 15 mL centrifuge tubes containing warm 9 mL mTeSR1 ROCK inhibitor medium by adding 10 μM Y-27632 (1:1,000 dilution of stock solution); 1 tube per cell line is needed.\nMark on the plate differentiated cells for removal using a microscope.\nWash 1× with warm PBS.\nAdd 1 mL of collagenase IV medium and incubate 15 min in the 37°C incubator; at this point the edges of the colonies start curling up and are ready to be detached.\nWash 2× with 3 mL of warm DMEM/F-12 medium.\nRemove the differentiated cells with a plastic tip.\nWash 1× with 3 mL of warm DMEM/F-12 medium.",
    "Add 1 mL mTeSR1 medium/well, scrap the cells using a cell lifter and resuspend the aggregates of cells from the 3 wells in 9 mL mTeSR1 ROCK inhibitor medium (equivalent to 1 × 106 cells/mL).\nTransfer to 3 wells of a low attachment 6-well plate and incubate with gentle shaking (90 rpm) in the 37°C incubator.\nDay 1: A homogeneous suspension of spherical EBs (ca. 200 μm) has formed. To collect the EBs, transfer the media carefully to 15 mL conical tubes and centrifuge at 200 xg for 1–2 min at room temperature, gently aspirate supernatant leaving approximately 200 μL of media in the bottom of the tube, gently flick with finger to resuspend cell pellet add 3 mL ScienCell Astrocyte media with AGS plus 2% FBS (AM medium) and supplemented with Noggin 500 ng/mL (1:1,000 dilution of stock solution) plus PDGF-AA 10 ng/mL (1:10,000 dilution of stock solution) resuspend by pipetting up and down gently 2–3 times with a 5 mL pipette and transfer to the same well. Keep agitation at 90 rpm.\nDays 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13: perform complete media change using 3 mL/well of the same media composition. EBs will increase in size and become translucent (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Keep agitation at 90 rpm.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1512-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

GPC lines expressing A2B5, NF1A and vimentin and 4-week old astrocytes expressing S100ß, CD44, GFAP and vimentin.\nNote: As EBs grow (4–5 times initial size in 3 weeks) media can be changed by simply using gravity in inclined plates under the flow hood.",
    "Days 15, 17, 19: switch to AM medium with just PDGF-AA 10 ng/mL (1:10,000 dilution of stock solution). Keep agitation.\nOn day 21 the EBs are homogeneous, spherical, translucent, ca. 900 μm in size, and are ready for dissociation.\nPrepare 6-wells PLO-laminin coated plates.\nFor each cell line, prepare deoxyribonuclease (DNase)/papain solution as indicated in the Worthington kit instructions (Papain dissociation system, https://www.worthington-biochem.com/PDS/cat.html[href=https://www.worthington-biochem.com/PDS/cat.html]): 1 vial of DNase resuspended with 0.5 mL of Earle’s balanced salt solution; add 0.25 mL to papain solution. 1 vial of papain resuspended with 5 mL of Earle’s balanced salt solution.\nCollect EBs from the 3 wells to a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 200 g for 1 min at room temperature or let them settle at the bottom of the tube.\nResuspend by flicking and wash 1× with 5 mL of warm PBS.\nResuspend EBs with 5.25 mL of ribonuclease/papain solution and transfer to a well of a 6-well plate.\nIncubate for 1 h in the 37°C 5% CO2 incubator and pipette vigorously up and down with a 1 mL pipette every 15 min.\nCheck under a microscope to confirm that the suspension is composed of single cells.\nCount the cells.\nPlate the cells 200,000–300,000 cells/mL (45,000–60,000 cells/cm2) in AM medium supplemented with FGF2 20 ng/mL (1:1,000 dilution of stock solution), EGF 20 ng/mL (1:1,000 dilution of stock solution), laminin 1 μg/mL (1:1,000 dilution of stock solution) and ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 10 μM (1:1,000 dilution of stock solution) in PLO-laminin coated plates (use 2 mL/well for 6-well plates).\nThe next day, replace medium with 2 mL of fresh AM supplemented with FGF2 20 ng/mL, EGF 20 ng/mL (expansion medium) to remove ROCK inhibitor Y-27632.\nCritical: Initial cell density is important for differentiation and expansion of GPC lines.",
    "Expansion, passage and preparation of frozen master stock of GPCs lines.\nPerform complete medium change every other day using 2–3 mL/well of expansion medium (AM supplemented with FGF2 20 ng/mL, EGF 20 ng/mL, laminin 1 μg/mL).\nWhen cells cover over 80% of the plate can be passaged using Accutase.\nPrepare 15 mL centrifuge tubes containing warm 12 mL DMEM/F-12 (1 tube per well of a 6-well plate) for cell wash. Warm Accutase solution.\nWash 1× with warm PBS.\nAdd 1 mL of warm Accutase per well of a 6-well plate and incubate 5–10 min in the 37°C incubator.\nCollect the cells by pipetting up and down and transfer to a centrifuge tube containing 12 mL DMEM/F-12 medium for washing.\nCentrifuge at 200 g, 5 min at room temperature.\nResuspend in sufficient expansion medium to replate at a 1:6–8 ratio (10,000–20,000 cells/cm2) on 6-well PLO-laminin coated plates.\nFor cryopreservation, dissociate with Accutase as for passaging (steps b–g). After centrifugation, remove supernatant and add drop by drop AM medium with 10% DMSO (1 mL per well of a 6-well plate will result in 1 × 106 cells per vial).\nTransfer to a cryovial and freeze at −80°C in an appropriate freezing container for 12–24 h, then store in a liquid nitrogen tank.\nCritical: GPCs can be grown sparse (5,000 cells/cm2) as they are highly proliferative.\nNote: Freezing down 5–10 vials containing 1 × 106 cells at P1 or P2 will allow sufficient vials to perform several studies with the same batch of GPCs. This will increase reproducibility of the results and protect from cell line loss due to contamination or other difficulties.\nNote: GPCs can be expanded and maintained for at least 10 passages with no decline in proliferation and ability to differentiate into astrocytes.\nThaw GPC lines.",
    "Prepare 15 mL centrifuge tubes containing warm 12 mL DMEM/F-12 (1 tube per well of a 6-well plate) for cell wash. Prepare 6-wells PLO-laminin coated plates.\nCells from one frozen vial are usually plated on a full 6-well plate at a density of 15,000 cells/cm2.\nThaw the cells quickly in a water bath at 37°C and transfer to a 15 mL centrifuge tube containing warm 12 mL DMEM/F-12 for washing.\nCentrifuge at 200 g for 5 min at room temperature.\nGently aspirate supernatant leaving approximately 100 μL of media in the bottom of the tube, gently flick with finger to resuspend cell pellet.\nAdd 12 mL of expansion medium (AM supplemented with FGF2 20 ng/mL, EGF 20 ng/mL, laminin 1 μg/mL).\nPlate on 2 mL/well in a 6-well PLO-laminin coated plate.\nNote: The recovery rate of GPCs is estimated to between 60% and 80%, depending on the cell lines.\nCritical: Complete removal of DMSO present in storage media by washing is very important due to its toxicity.\nAstrocyte differentiation\nTiming: >4 weeks\nThis step describes differentiation of GPCs into astrocytes.\nDay 1: plate GPCs at 15,000 cells/cm2 in expansion medium (AM supplemented with FGF2 20 ng/mL, EGF 20 ng/mL, laminin 1 μg/mL) in 6-well plates.\nNote: Differentiation can be started from passaged GPCs from passage 1–9 or from GPCs plated from frozen vials with equal efficiency.\nDay 2: start differentiation by changing the expansion AM medium to DMEM/F-12 Glutamax supplemented with N-2, B-27 and 10% FBS (induction media).\nDay 3–14: change media completely every other day.\nDay 15: split cells to non-coated plates using Accutase.\nPrepare 15 mL centrifuge tubes containing warm 12 mL DMEM/F-12 (1 tube per well of a 6-well plate) for cell wash. Warm Accutase solution (or Accumax).\nWash 1× with warm PBS.",
    "Add 1 mL of warm Accutase (or Accumax) and incubate 5–10 min in the 37°C incubator.\nCollect the cells by gently pipetting up and down and transfer to a centrifuge tube containing 12 mL DMEM/F-12 medium for washing.\nCentrifuge at 200 xg, 5 min at room temperature.\nResuspend in sufficient induction medium to replate at a 1:6 ratio (20,000–25,000 cells/cm2) on 6-well non-coated plates.\nAfter day 15: Perform complete medium change every other day using 2–3 mL/well of induction medium (DMEM/F-12 Glutamax supplemented with N-2, B-27 and 10% FBS).\nCritical: If astrocytes get stickier and difficult to dissociate, replace Accutase by Accumax.\nCritical: Plating cells onto non-coated plates at day 15 of differentiation purifies the cultures from progenitors and other types of cells while keeping the more mature astrocytes.\nNote: After splitting at day 15 astrocytes continue to proliferate. FBS can be reduced to 5% or 2% to reduce proliferation rate without affecting maturation.\nNote: Use of ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 10 μM for splitting astrocytes at day 15 improves viability but it is not required.\nPause point: Astrocytes can be stored frozen from day 7 up to 4 weeks post differentiation in induction medium plus 10% DMSO."
