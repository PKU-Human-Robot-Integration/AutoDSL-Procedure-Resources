  "procedures": [
    "All procedures were carried out in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University institutional animal care and use committee (permission number: 02-165-01). All the animal experiments were performed according to the ARRIVE guidelines.\n1. Preoperative preparation\nNOTE: Figure 1 shows the design of the surgical procedure.\nRigidly immobilize the knee joint with a plastic plate and two metal screws at approximately 135° flexion.\n\tNOTE: Perform the surgery at the proximal femur and the distal tibia without violating the joint component.\nPrepare materials and instruments for internal fixation.\n\t\nConstruct a medical grade polypropylene plastic plates by cutting a 5 mL syringe (Figure 2a) using a surgical scissor to fit the following dimensions: length, 25 mm; width, 10 mm; thickness, 1 mm (Figure 2b). Smooth the perimeter of the plate with a scalpel vertically. Rinse the plate with sterile saline to wash off the debris by three times.\n\t\t\nSterilize with 75% ethanol for 4 h followed by irradiating with ultraviolet light for 3 h.\nPre-drilling holes in the plastic plate: Prepare a hand-held low-speed electric drill with a speed of about 0-4000 rpm (Figure 2c). Drill two holes at both ends of the plate, diameters are 1 mm and 0.9 mm, respectively (Figure 2d). Match both ends of the plate with M 1.4 mm x 8 mm and M 1.2 mm x 6 mm steel screws, respectively (Figure 2e).\n\t\t\nWipe with 75% ethanol and sterilize with UV light for 3 h before use.",
    "Prepare surgical instruments: 1 straight Mosquito-Type hemostatic clamp, 1 smooth curved forceps, 2 eyelid retractors, 1 needle-holder, 1 tissue forceps, 1 suture scissor, 1 micro tissue scissor and 1 scalpel (Figure 2f). Sterilize the surgical instruments by autoclaving at 121.3 °C for 20 min and drying.\nExperimental animals\n\t\nUse Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) grade skeletally mature male Sprague-Dawley (or Wistar) rats, weighing between 250 - 350 g in the experiment.\n\t\tNOTE: Choose either female or male rats for the experiment.\nPlace the rats in cages and keep in a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle-controlled laboratory room. Provide adequate food and water.\n2. Surgery\nAdjust the temperature. Place a warming pad on a surgical platform in a thermostatic operating room.\nAnesthesia and skin preparation\n\t\nWeigh the rat with an electronic scale and record.\nRestrain the rat and perform an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (30 mg/kg) to induced anesthesia. Assessing that the animal is sufficiently anesthetized using the toe pinch22. Administer the eyes with lubricant to protect the cornea from drying during surgery.\nShave the lower body of the rat including the two hind limbs with an electric clipper and disinfect with a tincture of povidone iodine twice and 75% ethanol three times.\nPlace the rat laterally, and cover with the surgical drape exposing one side hind leg and hip.\nDisinfect the surgical area again with povidone iodine.\nImmobilize the knee joint with internal fixation using a mini-invasive technique.\n\tNOTE: Keep the incision properly moist with sterile saline during the operation. The surgery usually requires two surgeons.",
    "Mark the direction of skin incision. At the distal end of the femur greater trochanter, draw a line along the body surface projection of the muscle gap between the vastus lateralis and biceps femoris (Figure 3a). Incise the epidermis skin along the drawing line approximate 1.5 cm (Figure 3b).\nBluntly dissect the muscle gap between vastus lateralis and biceps femoris with a tissue forceps until the femoral shaft is exposed approximately 1 cm in length (Figure 3c). Use the retractor to facilitate continuous separation of the muscle gap.\nIncise the epidermis skin approximate 1 cm along the body surface projection of the muscle gap between the tibialis anterior and fibularis longus on the distal lower extremity (Figure 3d). Bluntly dissect the muscle gap until the tibia is exposed approximately 1 cm in length (Figure 3e).\nSeparate the soft tissues by the retractor and the smooth forceps, keep perpendicular and drill one 1.0 mm diameter hole into the femoral shaft at a speed of 1,500 rpm using an electric drill (Figure 3f). The proper drilling position is approximate 8 mm below the lower edge of the greater trochanter. Quickly press the wound to stop bleeding.\n\t\tNOTE: Proper drilling diameter can avoid intraoperative fractures.\nDrill one 0.9 mm diameter hole into the tibia approximate 4 mm below the edge of the tibiofibular fusion (Figure 4a). Perform the drilling carefully to prevent the crushing of muscles or tendons.\nUse the straight Mosquito-Type hemostatic clamp to form a submuscular course from the tibia hole to femur hole. The submuscular tunnel passes below the gastrocnemius in the tibia end and above the gluteus medius, below the biceps femoris in the femur end.",
    "Use one M 1.4 mm x 8 mm steel screw to secure one end of the plastic plate (with the 1.0 mm diameter hole) in the proximal femur (Figure 4b). Use one M 1.2 mm x 6 mm steel screw to secure another end of the plastic plate (with the 0.9 mm diameter hole) in the distal tibia (Figure 4c). Ensure the knee joint without varus deformity.\nClose the wound: Suture the myofascia, deep fasciae, and subcutaneous tissue using 4-0 absorbable sutures (Figure 4d). Close the skin with Polyamide sutures (Figure 4f).\n3. Postoperative management\nApply postoperative analgesia through subcutaneous injection of Buprenorphine (0.03 mg/mL) at 0.05 mg/kg . Add 5 mg/mL Neomycin into drinking water for 5 days after the surgery.\nInject the analgesia mixture (Buprenorphine and Carprofen) respectively at 0.05mg/kg and 5 mg/kg subcutaneously twice a day for at least 72 hours post-operation.\nCheck whether the hind limb had over-edema in case of vascular injury. Made sure that the rats can walk normally in the case of nerve injury during surgery.\n4. Postoperative examination\nObserve the healing of the surgical incision and physically examine the knee joint to evaluate early signs of infection every other day postoperatively. Check the degree of swelling of the ankle and metacarpophalangeal joint in case of continuous edema.\n\tNOTE: Early postoperative infection can cause wound exudate, leg swelling, and delayed wound healing.\nPerform X-ray imaging of the hindlimb to ensure that correctly placed the screws on the first postoperative day.\n\tNOTE: A Micro-CT scan analysis is another alternative option to display the proper location and the direction of the steel screws.\nMeasure the passive range of motion (ROM) to evaluate the development of contracture. Take a knee joint ROM measurement at different time cohorts postoperatively as described previously20.",
    "In brief, euthanize the rats and skin the hindlimbs. Remove the immobilizer and measure the knee joint angle using a mechanical arthrometer at two torques (667 or 1,060 g/cm)23.\nCalculate the ROM as a result of the total contracture, the myogenic contracture, and the arthrogenic contracture separately based on the investigation objectives24.\n\t\tNOTE: Set different time cohorts (i.e., 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 weeks) according to the research objectives. The contralateral knee joint (non-operative or sham-operated) can serve as a control2.\nHistological analysis of the posterior knee joint capsules.\n\t\nPrepare the joint tissues. Dissect the knee joint tissue and fix it with 4% paraformaldehyde. Decalcify and embed it in paraffin as previously reported25. Cut the sections (5 μm) at the medial midcondylar level in the sagittal plane.\n\t\tNOTE: Choose to perform different evaluating staining including HE, aldehyde-fuchsin-Masson Goldner (AFMG), Elastica–Masson, or Immunohistochemistry staining for histological study in the joint capsule based on your study objectives15,26.\nObserve histomorphometric changes in the posterior knee joint capsules. Photograph the posterior region of the knee joint. Observe fibrous deposition and adhesion changes between the diaphysis-synovium junction and the meniscus6.\n\t\tNOTE: Pathological changes of joint capsule are considered to be a pathogenic factor for knee joint contracture. Measure the length, the thickness, and the capsular areas of the posterior capsule as previously described according to the research content27.\nSubscription Required.
