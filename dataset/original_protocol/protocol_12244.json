Add to each well after the final wash. Incubate the secondary antibodies for 30 min at 37 °C.",
    "Note: Due to Alkaline Phosphatase Live Stain's (APLS) transient signal, the anti-CD44 primary incubation should be first performed by itself and the APLS should be added at the time of incubation with the secondary antibodies\nFollowing the secondary antibody incubation, aspirate off the solution and wash twice with DMEM/F-12 medium. Add fresh pre-warmed DMEM/F-12 medium to each well prior to final image capture.\nSet the imager software to acquire whole well images of each well using all three scanning parameters: phase contrast, green fluorescence and red fluorescence.

Measurement of Reprogramming Kinetics Using Flow Cytometry\nQuantitative Kinetic Measurement of Reprogramming using Cell Surface Antibodies\nPrior to reprogramming, set up the appropriate number of reprogramming experiments for each time point. For measuring kinetics of reprogramming for the first 7 days of reprogramming, individual transductions are performed for each desired time point. For time points after Day 7, seed sufficient feeder-independent time points to continue to measure the reprogramming events. A single well of a 6-well plate will yield sufficient amounts of cells for performing flow cytometry analysis.",
    "Measure all desired reprogramming time points from individual wells, as this is an end point assay. Aspirate off the Fibroblast Medium from the desired well. Wash once with D-PBS.\nAspirate off the D-PBS wash. Add 1 ml of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA solution to the well to be tested. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.\nFollowing the incubation, dissociate the cells into single cells by flushing the 1 ml cell suspension against the surface of the well and transfer the suspension into a 15 ml conical tube. Use 3 ml of D-PBS to wash off any remaining cells from the well and add them to the 15 ml conical. Use 10 ml of additional D-PBS to further dilute the cell solution in the conical tube.\nCentrifuge the cells at 200 x g for 2 min.

Pipet the content of each suspension in individual FACS tubes.",
    "Using the appropriate negative controls (unstained and isotype controls), confirm the proper forward and side scatter profile and voltages on the cytometer. Set the voltages for the corresponding fluorophores according to initial single stain parameters, such that the green fluorophores are activated by the Blue Laser and signals acquired in the BL1 channel, while far red fluorescing fluorophore and PE-Cy5 fluorophore are activated by the Red Laser and signals acquired in the RL1 channel. Acquire the dual-stained population for each time point.\nAnalyze the FCS files for each time point using the appropriate analysis software and use the editor to arrange data to observe the population expression shift over time.\nFollow steps 5.1.1 to 5.1.6, if cell sorting is desired at different time points. Use the appropriate fluorophore combinations according to the laser configuration of the cell sorter to be used.\nFollowing the final wash, re-suspend the cell pellet in 1 ml of the cell sorting buffer. Set up the cell sorter to the proper forward and side scatter settings using an unstained control. Use the single stained controls to set up the proper settings for each fluorophore.\nUse a small sample of the double-stained cell suspension; select the 2 populations to be sorted and assign the respective charge to ensure proper collection of the sorted cells.\nAdd 200 µl of the cell recovery medium into the collection tubes to ensure that the sorted cell suspension is cushioned and protected at the time of sorting. Harvest the desire number of cells and transfer onto new iMEF dishes containing freshly prepared recovery medium.\nChange the medium following overnight incubation with the recovery medium. The cultures must be subsequently fed and routinely passaged using hPSC medium containing Penicillin/Streptomycin (100 units/ml final concentration).\n6. Endpoint Analysis\nTerminal Alkaline Phosphatase (AP) Staining",
    "Use terminal chromogenic AP staining to correlate observed kinetic and morphological events with final reprogramming efficiencies.\nFollowing 21 days of reprogramming, remove the culture medium from the well to be stained with terminal AP stain and wash once with 200 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0).\nPrepare the appropriate amount of staining solution as directed by the manufacturer's manual in 200 mM Tris-HCl.\nAspirate the wash and add 2 ml of the prepared staining solution to each well. Incubate for 20 to 30 min at room temperature and away from the light.\nAspirate the staining solution and wash once with 200 mM Tris HCl. Remove the wash and add distilled water prior to visualization.\nCapture the colorimetric signal using a normal picture camera. Count the number of positively stained colonies by hand. Visualize the stain using fluorescent analysis in the Trit-C channel, as the stain is also fluorescent in nature and perform whole-well imaging and analyzed using the whole-well imager.
