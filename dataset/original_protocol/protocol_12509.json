    "All the proteins were overexpressed in E.coli with good yield and purity (>80%) following the literature protocols18. Biotinylation was carried out using a BirA-catalyzed reaction18. All small molecules were prepared at 1 mM stock solutions in 100% DMSO. The procedures described herein do not require specialized laboratory safety equipment or precautions. Standard laboratory personal protective equipment (PPE) should be used (i.e., lab coat, safety goggles, and gloves).\nProteins applied in this study are listed below:\nVHL: biotinylated VHL(53-213)/ElonginB (1-104)/ElonginC(17-112) complex with Avi-tag at the C-terminus of ElonginB.\nBrd4BD2: Non-tagged Brd4BD2(333-460)\nCRBN: biotinylated CRBN(319-442) with Avi-tag at the N terminus\nPPM1D: non-tagged or double His8-tagged PPM1D(1-420) at the N terminus\nSmall molecules applied in this study are listed below:\nMZ1 (MW = 1002.6 Da): PROTAC that binds to VHL and Brd4BD2\nBRD-2512 (MW = 841.4 Da): CRBN KD ~3 µM, doesn't bind to PPM1D\nBRD-5110 (MW = 872.0 Da): CRBN KD ~3 µM, PPM1D KD = 1-2 nM\nBRD-4761 (MW = 476.6 Da): doesn't bind to CRBN, PPM1D KD = 1-2 nM\n1. Method 1: ITC (isothermal titration calorimetry)\nNOTE: Titrations are performed using a micro-calorimeter with auto-injection.\nBuffer preparation: Prepare 3 L of buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, pH 7.5.\nDialysis: Dialyze VHL and Brd4BD2 (~ 500 µL at 150 µM each) against 1 L of the buffer prepared in step 1.1, 3 times at 4 ˚C, for 4 h, 2 h, and approximately 16 h, respectively. Save the buffer after the last dialysis for use in subsequent steps.\nPrepare samples on a 96-well plate with a plastic cover.",
    "For each titration, prepare 400 µL of solution for the cell, 125 µL for the syringe, and 400 µL of buffer for cleaning. Add samples to three consecutive wells on the plate. Since compound stock is prepared at 1 mM in 100% DMSO, add the same percentage of DMSO to the protein solutions to ensure the matching buffer in the cell and syringe. Add 2% DMSO to the final solutions.\n\t\t\nSample for the titration of VHL into MZ1: Prepare cell solution containing 392 µL of buffer, 4 µL of MZ1 at 1 mM (10 µM final concentration), and 4 µL of 100% DMSO. Prepare a syringe solution containing 122.5 µL of VHL at 85.7 µM, 2.5 µL of 100% DMSO (84 µM final concentration).\nSamples for the titration of VHL into the buffer (data will be used for background subtraction of data generated from sample 1.3.1.1): Prepare cell solution containing 392 µL buffer, 8 µL 100% DMSO. Prepare a syringe solution containing 122.5 µL of VHL at 85.7 µM, (84 µM final concentration) and add 2.5 µL of 100% DMSO.\nSamples for the titration of VHL into MZ1 and Brd4BD2: Prepare cell solution containing 392 µL of 17.1 µM Brd4BD2 (16.8 µM final concentration), 3.36 µL of MZ1 at 1 mM (8.4 µM final concentration), and 4.64 µL of 100% DMSO. Prepare a syringe solution containing 122.5 µL of VHL at 85.7 µM (84 µM final concentration) and 2.5 µL of 100% DMSO.\nSamples for the titration of VHL into Brd4BD2 (background of 1.3.1.3): Prepare cell solution containing 392 µL of 17.1 µM Brd4BD2 (16.8 µM final concentration) and 8 µL of 100% DMSO. Prepare a syringe solution containing 122.5 µL of VHL at 85.7 µM (84 µM final concentration) and 2.5 µL of 100% DMSO.",
    "Run all four titrations on the micro-calorimeter. Each consists of 19 injections of 2 µL syringe solution at a rate of 2 µL/s at 120 s time intervals. Make an initial injection of protein (0.4 µL) and discard it during data analysis. Perform all experiments at 25 ˚C, while stirring at 600 rpm.\nData analysis: Fit the data to a single-binding-site model to obtain the stoichiometry (n), the dissociation constant (KD), and the enthalpy of binding (ΔH) using the analysis software provided by the manufacturer (Figure 2).\n2. Method 2: BLI (biolayer interferometry)\nPerform BLI experiments using streptavidin (SA) coated sensors at room temperature (RT) with an acquisition rate of 5 Hz. During the automated BLI experiment, ensure the sensors are stationary within a single column and move between different columns of a 96-well, flat bottom, black plate with a maximum well volume of 392 µL. Fill each well of the plate used in the experiment with 200 µL of solution.\n\tNOTE: BLI is only useful to detect protein-protein interactions (i.e., ternary complex formation). It is not sensitive enough to detect interactions between proteins and small molecules.\n\t\nBuffer preparation: Prepare 100 mL of buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, 0.05% P20, pH 7.5.\nOptimization for the immobilization step: Load the test sensor to 1-3 nm, as recommended by the manufacturer. A loading of ~1.0 nm is used for the procedures described here. To achieve this, dip the sensor into a solution containing VHL at 1.5 µg/mL for 80 s.\nCarry out BLI kinetic measurements by applying seven SA sensors using the following sequence:\n\t\t\nFor the first baseline phase, dip into buffer for 60 s.\nFor the immobilization phase, dip into a solution of VHL at 1.5 µg/mL for 80 s.",
    "For the second baseline phase, dip into buffer for 60 s.\nFor the association phase, dip into solution of a fixed concentration of Brd4BD2 at 2 µM, fixed concentration of DMSO at 2%, and varying concentrations of MZ1 at 100 nM, 50 nM, 25 nM, 12.5 nM, 6.3 nM, 3.1 nM, and 0 nM (reference sensor) for 300 s.\nFor the dissociation phase, dip into buffer for 600 s.\nPerform data analysis using the manufacturer's software. kon, koff, and KD are reported for data fitting (Figure 3).\n3. Method 3: SPR (surface plasmon resonance)\nNOTE: All SPR experiments are carried out using streptavidin (SA) coated sensor chips at RT. Although the NTA chip is used for the detection between protein and small molecules, it is to be used with caution when applied to the ternary complex, as a much higher background than the SA chip is observed, possibly due to electrostatic interactions between the charged chip surface and protein in the analyte.\nSPR for VHL-MZ1 interaction\n\t\nBuffer preparation.\n\t\t\nPrepare a 1 L buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, 0.005% P20, pH7.5, and pass it through a 0.2 µm filter unit.\nRemove 20 mL of buffer for future use (DMSO-free buffer) and refill with 20 mL of DMSO (2% DMSO in the final running buffer). Keep DMSO at 2% in all the samples described below (steps 3.1 and 3.2)\nActivate the SA chip following the manufacturer's protocol and immobilize VHL to ~2000 RU (inject protein solution of 5 µg/mL at 5 µL/min).\nPrepare MZ1 in a 3-fold, 8-point serial dilution with the top concentration at 10 µM on a 384-well, conical bottom, translucent, polypropylene plate with a maximum volume of 130 µL. Cover the plate with self-adhesive, transparent plastic foils compatible with polypropylene microplates.",
    "Prepare the top concentration with the DMSO-free buffer to ensure the 2% DMSO at the final concentration. To 147 µL of DMSO-free buffer, add 1.5 µL of MZ1 stock at 1 mM and 1.5 µL of 100% DMSO.\nPrepare the 3-fold serial dilution with the running buffer containing 2% DMSO. To 100 µL of the running buffer, add 50 µL of solution at the top concentration prepared in step 3.1.3.1, and mix well to prepare the 2nd highest concentration.\nThen transfer 50 µL of the solution prepared in step 3.1.3.2 to the next 100 µL of running buffer, mix well to prepare the 3rd highest concentration, and so on.\nRun SPR using the multi-cycle setup: Mode: High-performance; contact time: 120 s; dissociation time: 300 s; flow rate: 50 µL/min.\nPerform data analysis using the evaluation software provided by the instrument manufacturer. Steady-state analysis indicated KD = 26 (± 3) nM and Rmax of ~91% (± 5%) binding achieved (Figure 4A)\nSPR for VHL: MZ1: Brd4BD2 ternary complex\n\t\nPrepare the buffer as described in step 3.1.1.\nActivate the SA chip following the manufacturer's protocol and immobilize VHL to ~100 RU. Inject a protein solution of 0.5 µg/mL VHL at a flow rate of 5 µL/min and contact time between 1-5 min until a surface density of ~100 RU is reached.\nPrepare samples for two 5-fold, 5-point single-cycle injections in a 96-well,clear, polystyrene, round bottom plate with a maximum volume of 323 µL and cover it with self-adhesive, transparent, plastic foils that are compatible with polystyrene microplates as described in steps 3.2.3.1-3.2.3.2.\n\t\t\nNegative control: analyte contains Brd4BD2 only.\n\t\t\t\nPrepare top concentration at 25 µM in running buffer with a volume of 200 µL (#A5)",
    "Add 160 µL each of Brd4BD2 at 2 µM in the running buffer to the next 4 wells on the left (#A1-A4)\nTransfer 40 µL of A5 to A4. Mix well.\nTransfer 40 µL of A4 to A3. Mix well. Keep doing so until A1.\nTernary complex formation: analyte contains MZ1 and Brd4BD2.\n\t\t\t\nPrepare the top concentration by adding 4 µL of MZ1 at 20 µM in 100%-DMSO solution to 196 µL containing 25.5 µM Brd4BD2 in DMSO-free buffer (#B5). The final concentrations are 25 µM Brd4BD2, 100 nM MZ1, and 2% DMSO.\nAdd 160 µL each of Brd4BD2 at 2 µM in the running buffer to the next 4 wells on the left (#B1-B4)\nTransfer 40 µL of B5 to B4. Mix well.\nTransfer 40 µL of B4 to B3. Mix well. Keep doing so until B1.\nRun SPR using the single-cycle setup: Contact time: 100 s; dissociation time: 720 s; flow rate: 50 µL/min. Apply three injections of buffer before each sample to ensure a stable background.\nData analysis: Apply the third injection of the buffer as the background for subtraction. As the negative control, when MZ1 is not present, the SPR response between VHL and Brd4BD2 is negligible. When MZ1 is present, kinetic fitting indicates the interaction between VHL and MZ1-Brd4BD2 complex has kon = 7.9 (± 1.5) *107 /M/s, koff = 0.014 s-1, and KD = 1 nM. (Figure 4B)\nSPR for CRBN and small molecule interactions\n\t\nBuffer preparation.\n\t\t\nPrepare a 1 L buffer containing 50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM TCEP, 0.005% P20, pH 7.5, and pass it through a 0.2 µm filter unit.",
    "Remove 20 mL of buffer and refill 20 mL of 100% DMSO (2% DMSO in the final running buffer). It is important to keep DMSO at 2% in all the samples described below (steps 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5).\nActivate the SA chip following the manufacturer's protocol and immobilize CRBN to ~800 RU.\nPrepare compounds in 3-fold, 6-pt serial dilution on a 384-well plate with a top concentration of 30 µM as described in 3.1.3.\nRun SPR using the multi-cycle setup: Mode: High-performance, contact time: 60 s, dissociation time: 90 s; flow rate: 50 µL/min. For this system, three buffer injections are sufficient to obtain a stable background. For other assay systems, it may be necessary to perform additional buffer injections.\nPerform data analysis using the manufacturer's software.\n\t\tNOTE: Steady-state analysis indicates KD of BRD-2512 and BRD-5110 are both around 3 µM. However, binding only reached ~ 70% Rmax binding at the top concentration. Both weak affinity and the shape of the sensorgram indicate that compound insolubility at high concentrations is likely to happen. Thus, the actual KD might be higher than 3 µM. BRD-4761, which does not bind to CRBN, was included as a negative control.\nSPR for PPM1D and small molecule interactions\n\t\nPrepare buffer as described in step 3.3.1. Use a nitriloacetic acid (NTA) sensor chip.\nApply single-cycle because the PPM1D warhead has a slow kon and koff. Regenerate the NTA chip using the manufacturer's default setup and immobilize PPM1D to ~ 1000 RU after each compound injection (inject protein solution of 5 µg/mL at 5 µL/min).\nPrepare compounds in 3-fold, 5-point serial dilution with the top concentration at 400 nM as described in 3.1.3.",
    "Run SPR using the single-cycle setup: Mode: high-performance; contact time: 90 s; dissociation time: 600 s; flow rate: 50 µL/min. Apply three injections of buffer before each compound to ensure a stable background.\nData analysis. Apply the third injection of the buffer as the background for subtraction. As the negative control, BRD-2512 does not show binding to PPM1D. For BRD-4761 and BRD-5110, kinetic fitting indicated the KD for both to be 1-2 nM.\nSPR for CRBN:PROTAC: PPM1D ternary complex\n\t\nPrepare buffer as described in step 3.3.1.\nActivate the SA chip following the manufacturer's protocol and immobilize CRBN to ~35 RU (inject a protein solution of 0.5 µg/mL at 5 µL/min).\nPrepare three compounds in 3-fold, 6-point serial dilution with a top concentration of 30 µM while keeping [PPM1D] at 1 µM in all samples, including blanks, using the method described in step 3.2.3.\nRun SPR using the multi-cycle setup: Mode: High-performance; contact time: 60 s; dissociation time: 90 s; flow rate: 50 µL/min.\nPerform data analysis using the manufacturer's software.\n\t\tNOTE: While BRD-2512 and BRD-4761 show no/negligible response, BRD-5110 clearly shows the \"hook effect\" at the steady state with fast on/off kinetics (Figure 5A-C). The experimental binding response from BRD-5110 (Figure 5C) is in between the predicted response from the simulation when assuming KD (CRBN, cpd) is 3 or 10 µM (Figure 5E), suggesting the ternary KD and binary KD are very similar. There is no apparent cooperativity of PPM1D: BRD-5110: CRBN complex formation.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
