    "The Institutional Research Ethics Committee from Centro Médico Nacional \"20 de Noviembre\", ISSSTE, approved this protocol (ID 383.2019). All enrolled patients signed written informed consent.\n1. Before bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) measurement\nNOTE: The BIA protocol procedure is measured using a single-frequency bioelectrical impedance device (Table of Materials). This device provides two values (resistance and reactance) at 50 kHz. Also, the BIA protocol described here is specific according to the single-frequency bioelectrical impedance device used.\nStandardization and technical requirements of the device\n\t\nTest the correct calibration of the device using the test resistor (500 Ω) provided by the manufacturer. Acceptable values for resistance and reactance are 495.0 to 505.0 Ω and -3.0 to 3.0 Ω, respectively. Ensure that the skin electrodes correspond to the same manufacturer's brand and that the device is not connected to the electric current.\nClean and disinfect the device and the leads with hydrogen peroxide solution-based water (1:4). Dampen a clean wiping cloth with the solution and rub gently along the wires and the outside of the device case.\nPatient analysis and preparation for the test (pre-test)\n\tNOTE: Patients diagnosed with IHD, male or female, and aged >18, were included. As well as patients with controlled comorbidities such as systemic arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus were also included. The mean weight and height were 70 kg and 160 cm, respectively. In addition, patients were excluded if they presented any of the following characteristics: active smoking or smoking cessation <6 months, myocardial infarction or stroke in the last 6 months, anemia, electrolyte imbalance, and chronic terminal diseases such as renal or hepatic failure.\n\t\nInform the patient regarding fasting for at least 2-3 h before the measurement.\nExplain the procedure to the patient.",
    "Collect gender, age, weight (in kg), and height (in cm) information. For measuring height and weight, use a digital portable precision scale, and a portable precision stadiometer, respectively (Table of Materials), and perform the measurements based on the standard method described by Lohman et al.17.\nInstruct the patient to take out any metal objects he/she is wearing (watches, rings, bracelets, necklaces, or any other) to avoid interference with the measurements. Ask the patient to remove their shoes and stocks.\nPlace the patient in a supine position on a stretcher bed. Ensure that arms and legs maintain an angular separation of 30° to 45° and the palms of the hands face upwards. If the thighs are too big, use a clean towel/sheet to create a non-conductive barrier and separate them. Also, make sure the material of the stretcher bed is not metal conductive.\n\t\tNOTE: To achieve stable fluid distribution after the patient acquires a supine position, recommended lying down for at least 5 min before BIA measurements.\nClean the area before connecting skin electrodes using a pad soaked with 70% ethyl alcohol.\nPlace four skin electrodes as described below. Place all skin electrodes according to manufacturer recommendations and with a distance between them of at least 5 to 10 cm to avoid electrode-electrode interaction.\n\t\t\nFirst, place proximal electrodes on the hands as follows: locate one electrode on the wrist, just between the lunate-scaphoid carpal joint and ulna-radius joint. Then, locate another electrode at the middle finger, just behind the metacarpophalangeal joint.\nThen, place the distal electrodes on the feet, as follows: locate one electrode on the ankle, at the joint between the internal and external malleoli and astragalus. Then, locate another electrode between the metatarsophalangeal joints of the third finger.\n2. BIA measurements",
    "Connect the circular outlet of the leads to the back of the device.\nFirst, connect the hand guide leads (proximal)- the red clip on the wrist, and the black clip on the middle finger, then connect the foot guide (distal) - the red clip on the ankle and the black clip on the third finger. Verify that all clips are placed on the skin electrode´s edge.\nInstruct the patient not to move while the measurement is performed.\nTurn on the device by pressing the ON button. Observe the values on the screen immediately and wait for 30 s to 60 s for resistance and reactance data to stabilize, then register those values. Turn off the device by pressing the OFF button.\nOnce the measurement is done, remove the red and black clips for the hand and the foot, then remove the skin electrodes carefully and discard them.\n3. Analysis and evaluation of hydration status by BIVA\nNOTE: Before starting the BIA analysis, it is necessary to download the BIVA software (Table of Materials). Note that the BIVA software is a spreadsheet with data from different populations and reference values of resistance and reactance arranged by sex18.\nThe BIVA software contains the following seven sheets: guide, reference populations, point graph, path, subjects, z-score, and z-graph. Click the Reference Population sheet and select the complete line according to the population to be evaluated. This methodology uses rows 9 and 10 (Mexican population)19.\nCopy the selected data and paste them into the second row.",
    "Click the Subjects sheet and fill manually the following information located in the second row- Column 1: Patient ID; Column 2: Seq, should always be 1; Column 3 and Column 4: indicate the Surname and Name, respectively; Column 5: Sex, assign F if female or M if male; Column 6 and Column 7: add values of resistance and reactance (previously registered), respectively; Column 8: Height, indicate value in cm; Column 9: Weight, indicate the value in kg; Column 10: Popl Code, indicate a value between 1 to 13 that appears in the first column of the reference population sheet to choose the population to be evaluated; Column 11: Group Code, add a value between 1 to 10 to select the patient to be evaluated; Column 12: Age, indicate the age in years.\nClick the Complement option in the main menu and click Calculate to obtain the resistance and reactance values adjusted by height (columns 13 and 14).\nClick the Point Graph sheet, and the R/H-Xc/H graph will be displayed for females or males. This graph contains the 50%, 75%, and 95% percentile tolerance ellipses adjusted by specific reference populations (Figure 1).\nWhen a dialog box named select groups is displayed, select the Group Option according to the last number indicated in the subject's sheet - Column 11. Add the value previously registered at the group code and click OK. A vector will be plotted showing the shape characteristics.\nInterpret the hydration status from the plot as follows: a vector between 50% and 95% percentiles tolerance ellipses indicates euhydration, whereas a vector outside the upper pole of 95% tolerance ellipse indicates hypohydration and a vector outside in the lower pole of 95% tolerance ellipse indicates hyperhydration.\n4. Before starting the exercise stress test (EST) protocol",
    "NOTE: The exercise stress test (EST) protocol20,21 is measured using a specialized medical treadmill (Table of Materials). EST is carried out according to the modified Bruce ramp protocol20,21 and supervised by an experienced cardiologist. \nPatient analysis and preparation\n\t\nEnsure the patient complies with the following characteristics before the test: avoid any strenuous physical activity at least 1 day before the test, and fast the patient at least 4 h before the test. Ask the patient to wear comfortable clothing for the test.\nExplain to the patient the EST protocol and register the gender, age, weight (in kg), and height (in cm). Enter the gender, age, weight, and height data into the EST system to automatically estimate the METS, VO2, and HR/O2 values during the test.\nAsk the patient about any physical disability (e.g., joint or chest pain, dyspnea, etc.) before EST. Observe the patient´s gait and ensure it does not present a walking disorder.\nEST devices connection to patient and system calibration\n\t\nSelect and place a size-fit EST mask, then gently fix it to the patient´s face.\nPerform an air leak test instructing the patient to cover the hole in the mask and breathe out. No sound should be heard.\nConnect the pink flow ends, one to the hole of the mask and the other to the wires of the EST equipment.\nWait for automatic calibration of the EST equipment's gas analysis elements, ensuring the environmental CO2 does not exceed 1,200 ppm.\nInstruct the patient to uncover the chest area and clean the skin with 70% isopropyl alcohol before placing the electrodes. Shave the area if necessary.\nConnect the 12-lead electrocardiographic electrodes on the patient´s chest according to the modified Mason-Likar22 standardization method and AHA scientific statement: exercise standards for testing and training20,21 as described below.",
    "Place four electrodes on the arms: one on the right arm (RA) over the acromion bone, one on the left arm (LA) over the acromion bone, one on the right costal margin (RCM), and one on the left costal margin (LCM).\nThen, place six electrodes on the chest: V1 on the second intercostal space and over the right border of the sternum, V2 on the second intercostal space and the left border of the sternum, V3 between V2 and V4, V4 on the fourth intercostal space crossing with the left midclavicular line, V5 on the fifth intercostal space at the level of the left anterior axillary line and V6 on the sixth intercostal space at the level of the left middle axillary line.\nPerform a resting spirometry instructing the patient to inhale deeply as much as possible, then indicate to exhale as fast and forcefully as possible, trying to maintain at least 6 s in the breath-out effort.\nEvaluate the reproducibility and quality criteria of the resting spirometry by repeating the breath-out effort 3x.\nEvaluate the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (VEF1) and the forced vital capacity (FVC) parameters provided in the EST system.\nChoose the best parameters the patient achieves according to VEF1/FVC to monitor it during the test.\n5. Performing the EST\nEvaluate the cardiac conditions (baseline electrocardiogram [EKG], heart rate, and blood pressure) to ensure the patient does not present limiting factors before starting the EST.\nExplain to the patient that the perceived physical effort during the EST is measured using the Borg scale from 0 to 2020.",
    "Monitor and evaluate the EST with attention to blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiographic trace changes every 3 min. Continue monitoring the perception of any symptoms (chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or extreme fatigue) and the perceived physical effort by the Borg scale. Perform these evaluations as follows.\n\t\nBlood pressure: Measure systolic and diastolic blood pressure every 3 min with a pneumatic device to evaluate a rise in systolic blood pressure proportional to the exercise load.\nHeart rate: Record beat by beat, in real-time, using 12-lead telemetry (stress electrocardiogram) to expect a linear increase in this variable with increasing load. Also, analyze the heart rhythm to differentiate it from non-sinus rhythms and detect arrhythmias by telemetry.\nSymptoms and signs: During the procedure, ask the patient if there is any discomfort, such as pain in the chest or extremities, difficulty breathing, altered alertness, decreased visual acuity, dizziness, or gait instability, and evaluate if exists the presence of low heart rate, oxygen saturation, or blood pressure.\nPerception of effort: As the procedure progresses, ask the patient about the degree of effort according to the Borg scale from 0 to 20. The lower numbers indicate light efforts, while the higher ones are heavy.\nStop the EST if the patient achieves > 85% of their heart rate (calculated according to age) or if the patient experiences any discomfort during the effort or shows significant electrocardiographic disturbances (ischemia or complex arrhythmias).\nAfter EST is finished, monitor closely the patient´s blood pressure, heart rate, and EKG during the next 1 min, 3 min, 5 min, and 8 min (recovery period), and ensure these parameters return to baseline values.\nExtract and register cardiopulmonary data from the EST software: METS, VO2, and HR/O2.\nSubscription Required.
