    "All experiments were approved by Peking University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, IACUC no. COE-LuoY-1).\n1. Islet Isolation\nPreparation of reagents and equipment.\nReconstitute collagenase P powder (2 U/mg) in HBSS to make a 5 mg/mL solution and filter it through a 0.22 µm filter to remove the bacteria. Prepare 0.6 mL-aliquot solutions of collagenase P in 15-mL conical tubes and store at -20 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: During use, each aliquot is diluted with HBSS to give 6-mL working solutions with final concentrations of 0.5 mg/mL, or 1 U/mL (enough for treating 3 mice). The working solution is kept on ice for immediate use within 1 h. The working solution should not be restored or re-frozen for additional usage.\nPrepare neutralization solution by adding FBS (2.5%) and P/S (1%) into HBSS; keep the solution on ice. Prepare 60 mL of neutralization solution to treat 6 mice.\nFor the islet culture medium, add D-glucose (7 mM), FBS (10%), and P/S (1%) to RPMI 1640 medium.\nAutoclave the surgery instruments at 115 °C for 30 min and 15 psi of pressure.\nInflation of the pancreas.\nPrepare 12 mL of collagenase working solution, as specified in step 1.1.1, for 6 mice (12 weeks old). Fill the 10 mL syringe with 9 mL of working solution and connect the syringe to the 27 G intravenous needle. Store the syringe on ice and use the solution within 1 h.\nEuthanize the mouse by cervical dislocation. Place the mouse in supine position on a paper towel, with the tail pointing towards the operator. Spray the whole body with 70% ethanol, making it completely wet.\nMake a V-incision, starting from the genital area and extending to the diaphragm, using dissection scissors and forceps. Fold the skin over the chest to completely reveal the abdominal cavity.",
    "Move the bowel to the right side of the mouse and expose the pancreas and common bile duct. Grab the duodenum carefully with forceps and pull it until the bile duct is taut (Figure 1A-1 and A-2).\nFind the portal vein and bile duct leading into the liver. Clamp the portal vein and bile duct with a microscopic hemostatic clamp.\n\t\tNOTE: The clamping prevents excessive bleeding and the entry of the collagenase into the liver.\nWhile still holding the intestine with the forceps, find the location of the ampulla that connects the bile duct and the duodenum. Insert the 27G intravenous needle into the common bile duct through the ampulla (Figure 1B-1 and B-2).\nDispense about 200 µL of collagenase working solution to check if the cannulation is all the way through bile duct. If the collagenase solution begins to fill the duct ( Figure 1C-1 and C2), the needle is in the lumen of the duct; clamp the duct segment containing the needle using an artery hemostatic clamp and dispense the rest of the 2 mL of solution at a slow and constant rate within 1 min (Figure 2A-1, A-2, and B-1).\n\t\tNOTE: If the tissue surrounding the duct begins to inflate (Figure 2B-2), the needle has poked through the wall of the bile duct, making it necessary to reposition the needle and try cannulating the bile duct again. Similarly, if the duodenum begins to inflate (Figure 2C-1 and C-2), the artery hemostatic clamp needs to be adjusted and the bile duct re-cannulated. As the collagenase solution fills up the pancreas, the tissue near the duodenum inflates first, followed by the region near the pancreatic tail. The perfusion of the pancreatic tail (the splenic lobe) is important to maximize the islet yield.",
    "After the complete inflation of the pancreas (Figure 2C-1), push the bowel to the left side of the mouse and remove the pancreas by starting at the descending colon. Use the forceps to lift the bowel and separate it from the pancreas with another pair of forceps. Continue to remove the pancreas until it is unattached from the top of the stomach. Finally, lift the pancreas out of the abdomen and cut it free from the remaining spleen.\n\t\tNOTE: The whole separation should be performed quickly, as the digestion continues during the removal process.\nPlace the pancreas in an empty 15-mL conical tube and leave it on ice. Repeat the above procedure for the remaining mice. All pancreas should be further processed within 1 h by promptly following step 1.3 to prevent over-digestion by collagenase P.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54995/54995fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Photographs showing the cannulation of the bile duct and the perfusion of the pancreas with collagenase solutions.

    "Figure 2: Troubleshooting for the cannulation. (A1) The needle tip inserted in the lumen of the bile duct. (A2) The duct filled with enzyme solutions. (B1) The needle inserted in the lumen of the bile duct, and the duct filled with a blue dye. (B2) Due to inappropriate cannulation, the needle is beneath the bile duct, and only an inflated capsule is observed after dispensing the blue dye. (C1) A successful cannulation is evidenced by the distension of pancreas. (C2) Due to inappropriate clamping, blue dye enters the duodenum and causes distention.

Collect the islet suspensions in a new 50-mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge the tubes for 3 min at 230 x g and 4 °C and pour off the supernatant carefully, without disturbing the tissue pellets.\nResuspend the pellets from 3 mice in 4 mL of polysucrose density gradient by vortexing gently or pipetting the suspension up and down a few times. Slowly pipette 4 mL of HBSS down the side of the tube to the top of the polysucrose solutions.\n\t\tNOTE: The two solutions should be well-separated layers with a sharp interface.",
    "NOTE: The addition of HBSS should be performed with care, without disturbing the polysucrose density gradient at the bottom.\nCentrifuge the suspension for 20 min at 900 x g and 4 °C by selecting a very slow acceleration rate. End the centrifugation with no brake.\n\t\tNOTE: This is a step to purify the islets from the exocrine cells, with most of the islets migrating to the interface between the layers of polysucrose and HBSS and most exocrine cells settling at the bottom.\nRemove the entirety of the 8-mL supernatant solutions using a large-bore 15-mL pipette. Pass the solutions through an inverted 70-µm strainer.\n\t\tNOTE: The islets will be further purified and retained by the strainer, while the exocrine cells will pass through the filter.\n\t\tCaution: The polysucorse density gradient is cell-toxic; the filtration will help islets get rid of the polysucrose.\nPipette 2 mL of cold neutralization solution into a 35-mm Petri dish. Invert the cell strainer right-side-up, dip the surface retaining the islets in the solution, and gently shake to release the islets.\nHand-pick the islets under a microscope using a 20-µL pipette with a white tip.\n\t\tNOTE: The islets are yellowish, compact cell aggregates (Figure 3A), while the contaminating exocrine tissue or cells have a blackish and loose structure under the dissecting microscope.\nPlace about 200 islets in a 35-mm dish with 2 mL of culture medium and incubate at 37 °C in an incubator supplied with 5% CO2 for 12 h.\n\t\tNOTE: Usually 150-300 islets can be harvested from one 12-week-old C57BL/6J mouse. Islets are prone to forming aggregates during culture, and the big islets (>300 µm) are susceptible to central necrosis (Figure 1B, inset). Shake the suspension well to evenly distribute the islets in the dish and to reduce clumping.\n2. Islet Culture on the Scaffold",
    "NOTE: DCS has a porosity of about 79%, a thickness of about 0.6 mm, and a pore size ranging from 12 to 300 µm.\nCut the scaffolds into 7-mm disks, soak them in 70% ethanol, and wash them with HBSS. Place the scaffolds in the 24-well tissue culture inserts.\n\tNOTE: When fresh islets are recovered after overnight culture, the islets appear bright and tight, with smooth borders (Figure 3B).\nSwirl the dish and collect the islets from the center of the dish using a 20 µL pipette with a white tip. Transfer the islets to the scaffolds (250 islets/scaffold) using a pipette and add 2 mL of culture medium to the well. Culture the islets for 12 h before transplantation.\n3. Islets Transplantation at the EFP Site\nDiabetes induction in recipient mice.\nPlace C57BL/6J mice (more than 10 weeks old) in a fresh cage with a water supply but no food. Fast the mice for 10 h before the induction of diabetes.\nPrepare buffer solutions with pH values of 4.2-4.5 by mixing 0.1 M citric acid with 0.1 M sodium citrate. Dissolve STZ (10 mg/mL) in the freshly prepared buffer and sterilize the solution by passaging it through a 0.22 µm filter.\n\t\tNOTE: STZ is light-sensitive and loses activity within 10 min; always prepare the fresh STZ solution right before injection.\nInject each mouse intraperitoneally with STZ at a dose of 140-150 mg/kg for each C57BL/6J mouse.\n\t\tNOTE: The dose varies depending upon the age and species of the animal. It is recommended to perform a small-scale dose optimization test for the given species before starting the formal experiment.\nCollect the tail vein blood and monitor the blood glucose with a glucose meter on days 2, 3, and 4 post-STZ injection.",
    "NOTE: When the animals are hyperglycemic (non-fasting blood glucose > 16.7 mM) on two consecutive days, they are ready for islet transplantation.\nTransplantation of islets to the EFP site.\nAnesthetize the mice with pentobarbital delivered intraperitoneally (50 mg/kg). Place the mouse in supine position on a paper towel, with the tail pointing towards the operator. Shave the abdomen extensively to remove the fur from around the incision site. Tape down the four limbs and swab the skin completely with alternating alcohol and iodophor wipes moved in a circular fashion to sterilize the incision site. Drape the mouse with a sterile drape, only allowing access to the incision area. Make a 7 mm incision through the peritoneal wall in the midline, close to the genital area.\n\t\tNOTE: All instruments used during the surgery, including gloves, should be sterile.\nGently grab and remove the EFP from the abdominal cavity using forceps. Spread the EFP on wetted sterile gauze. Place the scaffold containing islets on the EFP and fold the EFP to wrap the transplant. Secure the direct contact between the islets and EFP by suturing the EFP with absorbable 6-0 sutures. Wet the surface of the EFP with sterile saline using a soaked cotton swab to prevent the EFP from drying out.\nGently place the EFP back in the abdominal cavity. Close the incision by suturing the peritoneal wall and clamping the dermal layer with wound clips.\nInject buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) subcutaneously as an analgesic.\nInject 1 mL of saline subcutaneously to prevent dehydration.\nPlace the mouse in a cage on a heating pad until the mouse recovers from anesthesia.",
    "Check the non-fasting glucose levels two days later by collecting blood from the tail vein. If retrieving the graft, repeat the above transplantion procedures, gently pull out the EFP, use 3-0 suture to ligate the end of the fat pad adjacent to the epididymis, occlude the blood vessels, explant the EFP graft, and preserve it for histology.\n\t\tNOTE: Explanting the islets should render the recipient mice hyperglycemic again within 3 days, confirming the function of the graft.\nSubscription Required.
