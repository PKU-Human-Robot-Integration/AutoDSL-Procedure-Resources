    "All experiments were carried out in accordance with the Canadian Council of Animal Care and approved by the University of Lethbridge, Animal Care Committee.\n1. Breeding and Tactile Stimulation\nOrder pregnant rats from common animal suppliers or breed pups in-house using standard laboratory breeding procedures.\nHouse all animals in a temperature controlled breeding room (21 °C), maintained on a 12:12 hr light:dark cycle and provide access to food and water ad libitum.\nWhen pups are born, house female rats individually with their offspring.\nTo avoid additional stress related to handling immediately after birth, commence tactile stimulation of pups at P3.\nTactile stimulation should be carried out three times per day (9:00 AM, 1:00 PM, and 4:00 PM) from P3-P21 and pups should be weaned from their mothers at P21.\nWhen using a cross litter design, half of the pups from each litter will undergo tactile stimulation with the other half serving as controls. Randomly assign equal numbers of male and female pups to each group. To differentiate pups undergoing tactile stimulation and controls, mark one group of pups with a permanent marker on their hind legs and tail. Marking has to be re-applied every other day.\nTactile Stimulation\nRemove dams from their home cage and place them in a temporary cage with food and water. Keep the dam and temporary cage in the breeding/housing room.\nWeigh rat pups as a group prior to the morning tactile stimulation session (9:00 AM). For each session, transport rat pups their home cages to a separate testing room for tactile stimulation. Place the home cage on a heating pad that is set to 24 °C.",
    "Use a stiff board to divide the home cage into two halves. Place rat pups in the tactile stimulation group one half and control pups in the other half. Set a timer to 15 min.\nUsing a soft feather-like duster, brush all pups in the tactile stimulation group at the same time for 15 consecutive min. The young rat pups (~P3-P12) ususally huddle together and appear to enter a deep sleep cycle making it very easy to stimulate all pups at once. As the pups age, they become more active, with some pups walking and investigating during the session. The experimenter should continuously move wandering pups into the group to ensure each pup receives equal stimulation.\nOnce the 15 min session is complete, transport the pups back to the breeding room and return the mother to the cage.\nRepeat this process three times a day for the 19 days of tactile stimulation. After the final tactile stimulation session at P21, the pups should be weaned from their mothers. Pups should then be housed in cages with 5 or 6 other weaned animals of the same-sex.\nIf rats are undergoing no additional testing, they should be left undisturbed, on the normal light:dark cycle with access to food and water ad libitm (aside from regular cage cleaning and handling) until they reach approximately 100 days of age. If undergoing other experimental manipulations, animals should be treated or tested in accordance with those laboratory protocols.\n2. Sacrifice and Golgi-Cox Staining\nAt approximately P100, administer an overdose of sodium pentobarbital via I.P. injection to the rats and perfuse intracardially with approximately 100 ml of 0.9% saline.",
    "Extract the brains when the perfusion is complete. Remove the brains from the skull, cutting the optic nerve underneath with effort to keep the cerebellum intact; researchers may choose to keep or remove the olfactory bulbs. Place extracted brains in an opaque Nalgene bottle with 20 ml of Golgi-Cox solution 14.\nKeep the brains in Golgi-Cox solution for 14 days. After 14 days, replace the Golgi-Cox solution with a 30% sucrose solution. Keep the brains in the sucrose solution for 2-5 days before sectioning.\nNote: If brains cannot be sectioned within 14 days of transfer to the sucrose solution, the researcher needs to replace the sucrose with a new stock of 30% sucrose. The researcher may replace the sucrose every two weeks for 4 months with no adverse effects on staining.\nIn order to section the brain, the brain should be blotted dry and fixed to the sectioning stage with cyanocacrylic glue. To prevent tearing or uneven sectioning, the researcher must be cautious and ensure that the entire brain is firmly secured to the stage.\nThe vibratome reservoir must be filled with 6% sucrose solution to a level that covers the sectioning blade. Set the vibratome parameters to a speed and amplitude to 5, (the midpoint on both scales). Slice the brain into 200 μm sections and place the sections on a 2% gelatinized microscope slide. Be sure to keep the sections wet during the course of sectioning.",
    "When all of the sections of interest have been collected, press the sections onto the slides by applying pressure to the slides with moistened bibulous paper. Store the slides in a slide rack in the humidity chamber until they are ready to be stained. They should remain in the humidity chamber for at least 12 hr, but not longer than 4 days. The slides need to be moist and should not be permitted to dry out.\nPrepare the staining regiment before commencing the staining process. Label twelve glass staining dishes (10.7 x 8.5 x 6.8 cm) and process in the following manner:\n\t\nDistilled Water - 1 min\nAmmonium Hydroxide - 30 min (in the dark)\nDistilled Water - 1 min\nKodak Fix for Film - 30 min (in the dark)\nDistilled Water - 1 min\n50% Alcohol - 1 min\n70% Alcohol - 1 min\n95% Alcohol - 1 min\n100% Alcohol - 5 min\n100% Alcohol - 5 min\nSolution (1/3 Chloroform, 1/3 HemoDe, 1/3 100% Alcohol) - 15 min\nHemoDe - 15 min\n* Xylene can be used in replace of HemoDe. In order to ensure consistent staining quality, fresh solutions should be used for each slide rack processed.\nFollowing the last 15 min emersion in HemoDe, coverslip the slides with Permount.\nAllow the slides to air dry before examining with a microscope."
