    "Note: The chances of RNase contamination should be minimized throughout this protocol even if not specifically indicated. Use disposable RNase-free plastics and certified RNase-free solutions whenever possible. Use gloves in all steps even when handling non-hazardous reagents and work in RNase-decontaminated surfaces with RNase-decontaminated materials. Cell cultureNote: For this procedure to be successful, cells must be grown in serum-free medium (SFM), to avoid the presence of serum RNases. In this protocol, we will use Mammary Epithelial Growth Medium (MEGM, Lonza) and MCF-7 cells, but this can be adapted to other cell lines. However, finding a suitable SFM for each cell line is not trivial. Serum deprivation can induce cell stress and this can affect both intracellular and extracellular RNA profiles. As described in Tosar et al. (2020), we monitor this by Western blot, looking at eIF2 subunit α (Ser 51) phosphorylation levels, and by nonradioactive Northern blot, monitoring the levels of stress-induced tRNA-derived fragments (Yamasaki et al., 2009). For certain cell types, commercial SFM formulations are available. We have observed that MCF-7 cells can be grown for short periods of time in MEGM, which is the recommended growth medium by ATCC for other mammary epithelial cell lines such as MCF-10A. However, we do not add the Bovine Pitutary Extract contained in the MEGM kit to keep this as a chemically-defined medium. We also do not add antibiotics to our cell cultures unless needed. In theory, this protocol could be applied to suspension cells, 3D cultures and organoids with slight modifications, although we have not tried these applications yet. Seed aprox. One million cells in each of two T-75 flask. Grow cells up to 60-70% confluency in complete medium (e.g., DMEM + 10% FBS) at 37 °C and 5% CO2.",
    "Confluency should be adapted depending on the growth rate of each cell line. The aim is 80-90% confluency 48 h later.Wash cells briefly with 3-5 ml pre-warmed DMEM or PBS.Add 10 ml of pre-warmed MEGM. Grow cells for 24 h.Wash cells again with pre-warmed MEGM. Add 10 ml of pre-warmed MEGM to one of the flasks (hereafter: control). Add 10 ml of pre-warmed MEGM + 80U (2 µl) of murine RNase inhibitor to the second flask (hereafter: RI-treated) and incubate for further 24 h.Aspirate cell-conditioned medium from both flasks and discharge in 15 ml nuclease-free Falcon conical tubes. Add 1 µl of murine RNase inhibitor to the RI-treated flask (only). Spin down cells at 800 × g for 5 min at room temperature.While centrifuging cell-conditioned medium, move the empty flasks containing the cell monolayers to a fume hood and lyse cells in 2 ml of Trizol. Gently tilt the flasks to lyse all cells, incubate 5 min at room temperature, close the lid and store the flask at -20 °C. This will be later used to obtain intracellular RNA profiles.Place the supernatant from Step A5 to a new 15 ml nuclease-free Falcon conical tube and centrifuge at 2,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. We routinely store the supernatant from this spin (saved in a new tube) at -20 °C for later use.Preparation of extracellular nonvesicular samples by ultracentrifugationNote: Ultracentrifugation requires specific training in situ. This protocol is not intended to be substitute for this training. Improper use of ultracentrifuges can provoke sample lost, permanent damage to expensive equipment and put the safety of the laboratory personnel at risk. Thaw the tubes from Step A7 by placing the tubes in a beaker containing water at room temperature. Exchange the water several times, as it will cool rapidly.",
    "Add 1 µl of murine RNase inhibitor to the tube containing the RI-treated sample. Because recombinant RNase inhibitors contain many cysteines and are prone to oxidation, we usually add this boosters to ensure lack of RNase activity.Spin the samples again at 2,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove precipitates that could have formed during freeze/thaw.Place the samples in two identical ultraclear ultracentrifugation tubes. If necessary, adjust the volume of the samples with ice-cold nuclease-free PBS so that the tubes are up to their full capacity minus 2-3 mm from the top of the tube. All opposing tubes for a run must be filled to the same level with liquid of the same density.Place the tubes in the buckets. We also check that buckets containing filled tubes show a difference in weight equal or less than 2 mg if they were placed in opposite positions of the rotor. Place the buckets in an already cooled rotor (stored in a cold room overnight). Place the rotor in the ultracentrifuge, set all relevant parameters and start vaccum.Note: Forgetting to cool the rotors overnight played an important role in the development of this protocol. A science journalist wrote a story about this episode that gives some historical context (Khamsi, 2020). Run for 2.5 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C with maximum acceleration and break.Transfer the supernatants from Step B6 to new tubes. Keep the tubes on ice.Concentrate to 500 µl by ultrafiltration at 4 °C, using Vivaspin 20 units with a molecular weight cut-off of 10 kDa. Run ultrafiltration units with nuclease free PBS or water before loading the samples in order to clean the membranes. Transfer the concentrate to a new, nuclease-free 1.5 ml tube.",
    "Size-exclusion chromatographyNote: This procedure needs to be done twice, with the RI-treated and control samples. Working with an FPLC system also requires specific training in situ as high pressures will be used. Avoid introduction of air to the column at all stages and the injection of samples or solvents containing dust or other particulates. Filter 500 ml of ultrapure water and 500 ml of 1× PBS (prepared in ultrapure water) through a 0.22 µm or a 0.45 µm membrane using a vacuum filtration device. Degass the solutions with a magnetic stirrer under reduced pressure.Set an alarm in the FPLC system lower or equal to the maximum pressure admitted by the column (in this case, 1.5 MPa). Connect a Superdex 200 10/300 column to the FPLC system. Remove ethanol from the column by passing at least 1.5 volumes of filtered and degassed water. Equilibrate the column in 1× PBS.Connect a 500 µl loop to the system. Clean the loop with water, and then with filtered PBS. Avoid the introduction of air bubbles.Spin the sample (from Step B8) at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Transfer the supernatant to a new tube.Using a 1 ml syringe, inject the sample from Step C4 (500 µl) in the column.Run at a flow rate of 1 ml/min by monitoring absorbance at 280 nm and 260 nm, simultaneously.Collect fractions of 0.25 ml using a new, RNase-free 96-well plate. Start collection at least 2 ml before elution of the fractions corresponding to the void volume.Identify fractions were ABS260 > ABS280 in both samples. In contrast to proteins, nucleic acids absorb more UV light at 260 nm than at 280 nm. Thus, these fractions correspond to the elution of nucleic acids or ribonucleoprotein complexes.",
    "At least in MCF-7 cells, the control sample should show a main 260 nm peak at Ve = 15 ml (that we call “P1”: adjusted Ve’ = 7.5 ml) and a lower peak at Ve = 16.5 ml (that we call “P2”: adjusted Ve’ = 9.0 ml). In contrast, the P2 peak should not be seen in the RI-treated sample, and a new peak should appear in the void volume (that we call “P0”: Ve = 7.5 ml; adjusted Ve’ = 0 ml) (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3918/bioprotoc-11-04-3918-g001.jpgFigure 1. Representative chromatograms of RI-treated (top) and control (bottom) samples. The absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm is shown in red and blue, respectively. Peaks with 280/260 > 1 correspond to the elution of proteins, while peaks with 280/260 < 1 correspond to the elution of nucleic acids and/or ribonucleoprotein complexes. Ve: elution volume. Modified from Tosar et al. (2020).Transfer fractions corresponding to peaks P0, P1 and P2 from both samples to new 1.5 ml RNase-free tubes. Make sure that paired fractions correspond to the same elution volumes, even if no evident peaks are present (e.g., P0 in control or P2 in RI-treated).In a fume hood, add 750 µl of Trizol LS to each collected fraction (250 µl). Proceed with RNA extraction following the instructions of the manufacturers.RNA analysis and next-generation sequencingResuspend the RNA pellet in 9 µl of RNase-free water. Check RNA concentration using 1 µl of each sample and a Qubit fluorimeter (following the instructions of the vendor). If using a Bioanalyzer to check RNA integrity, rembember these are not intracellular samples and therefore the concept of RNA Integrity Number (RIN) does not apply here. Nevertheless, the P0 peak in the RI-treated samples should contain intact ribosomal RNAs.",
    "Instead of using the Bioanalyzer, we characterize the RNAs in each fraction by denaturing gel electrophoresis using custom-made 6% polyacrylamide-8 M urea gels (P0) or 10% polyacrylamide-8M urea gels (P1 and P2) in 0.5× Tris-Borate-EDTA buffer. Mix 1 µl of each sample with 1 µl of a 2× loading dye suitable for denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Figure 2). Pre-cast gels can be used as a time-effective alternative to custom-made gels (e.g., Novex TBE-Urea, ThermoFisher, catalog number:  EC6875BOX  ; run on the XCell SureLock Mini-Cell, ThermoFisher, catalog number:  EI0001  ).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3918/bioprotoc-11-04-3918-g002.jpgFigure 2. Analysis of the P1 peak either with (+) or without (−) RI treatment (left gel) or the P0 peak (right gel) in a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Cells: intracellular RNA extracted from MCF-7 cells. Bands corresponding to tRNAs, 5S rRNA, 5.8S rRNA, 7SL RNA, 18S rRNA and 28S rRNA are indicated. Numbers at the left (100, 200, 300) correspond to the migration of a RNA ladder (not shown). The gel shows that RNAs in the P1 peak are shifted from full-length tRNAs (+RI) to small RNAs of around 30 nt (-RI). In contrast, RNAs in P0 are considerably larger, and bands of the size of 28S, 18S and 5.8S rRNAs are evident. Modified from Tosar et al. (2020).Using the remaining 7 µl of each sample, proceed to sequencing library preparation using a small RNA kit such as the NebNext Small RNA sequencing kit for Illumina. Perform single-end sequencing in an Illumina platform. In our study (Tosar et al., 2020) we sequenced for 200 cycles in order to be able to detect some full-length RNAs (e.g., 5.8S rRNA) and not only their fragments, based on gel electrophoresis results (Figure 2). However, doing so has a major drawback.",
    "Since most of the clusters in the chip contain inserts of small size, sequencing for longer than 150 cycles provokes sequencing the entire adapter, polymerase run off, and abortive termination of the sequencing reaction before proceeding to demultiplexation, at least in a MiSeq benchtop sequencer as the one we used. Data analysis can still be performed because the index will be contained as part of the sequence of each read. However, extracting data from an aborted run is not straightforward, and we recommend not to proceed for longer than 100-150 cycles unless understanding exactly what is being done."
