    "MDSCs isolation from bone marrowTake the hind limbs from two C57BL/6 mice, cutting the bone extremities. Under a sterile biosafety cabinet, completely remove flesh from the bones. Put the bones in a Petri dish and inject 10 ml of complete RPMI medium (see Recipes) inside each thigh bone using a 10 ml syringe with a 26 G ½ needle, in order to extract the bone marrow.Aspirate and discharge the medium until the bone marrow cells are completely resuspended, using the same initial 10 ml of RPMI.Transfer the bone marrow cells suspension in a 15 ml Falcon tube supplied with a 40 µm cell strainer, then remove the cell strainer and centrifuge (582 x g, 10 min, RT).Discard the supernatant and resuspend cells in 10 ml of fresh complete RPMI.Count cells, properly diluting them in trypan blue (from 4 legs, approximately 50 x 106 cells can be obtained).Centrifuge the cell suspension (582 x g, 10 min, RT).Sort CD11b+ cells:Resuspend cell pellet in 80 µl of ice-cold MACS buffer (see Recipes) per 107 total cells.Add 20 µl of CD11b Microbeads per 107 total cells.Mix well and incubate for 15 min at 4 °C.Wash cells by adding 1-2 ml of ice-cold MACS buffer per 107 cells and centrifuge (582 x g, 10 min, 4 °C).Resuspend up to 108 cells in 500 µl of MACS buffer. Proceed with magnetic separation. Place the column in the magnetic field and rinse with the appropriate amount of buffer: MS column 500 µl (up to 108 cells), LS column 3 ml (from 108 cells to 109 cells).Apply the cell suspension onto the column. Collect unlabeled cells which pass through and wash column with the appropriate amount of buffer.",
    "Perform washing steps by adding ice-cold MACS buffer three times, each time once the column reservoir is empty (MS column: 3 x 500 µl, LS column: 3 x 3 ml). Collect the total effluent (the unlabeled cell fraction).Remove column from the separator and place it on a suitable collection tube.Pipette appropriate amount of buffer onto the column. Immediately flush out fraction with the magnetically labeled cells by firmly applying the plunger supplied with the column (MS: 1 ml, LS: 5 ml).Centrifuge the labeled cells (CD11b+ cells) (582 x g, 10 min, RT). Usually, from 50 x 106 BM cells, the recovery of CD11b+ cells is about 15 x 106 cells.Resuspend the sorted CD11b+ cells (1 x 106 cells/ml) in complete RPMI containing 30% TCCM (see Recipes), 20 ng/ml of GMCSF and 20 ng/ml of IL-4. Both GMCSF and IL-4 are resuspended in RPMI and aliquoted and stored at -80 °C.Plate the cells 1 ml/well in a 24-well plate. Incubate cells for 4 days at 37 °C.After 4 days change the medium: recover cells by pipetting them in a 50 ml Falcon tube and centrifuge (805 x g, 10 min, RT). Discard the supernatant and add new RPMI containing 30% TCCM, 20 ng/ml of GMCSF and 20 ng/ml of IL-4. Plate again the cells 1 ml/well in a 24-well plate.After 7 days, isolate CD11c+ DCs from spleens.CD11c+ DCs isolation from spleenBefore starting, prepare 2 solutions of collagenase; for each spleen prepare 1 ml of each collagenase solution (15 ml of 100 and 15 ml of 400 U/ml) (see Recipes) as described in the Recipes section.Take spleens from 15 C57BL/6 mice.Put the spleens in a Petri dish and inject in each spleen 1 ml of the 100 U/ml collagenase solution (i.e.",
    ", for 15 spleens, use 15 ml of 100 U/ml collagenase solution) using a 10 ml syringe with a 26 G ½ needle, until the spleen change colour (spleens colour should fade from red to white). Repeat this step twice.Recover the cell suspension and filter it in a 50 ml Falcon tube supplied with a 40 µm cell strainer, already containing 5 ml of complete RPMI. Keep this supernatant at RT.Incubate the spleens with 1 ml/spleen of 400 U/ml collagenase solution for 30 min at 37 °C.Recover the collagenase solution in a 10 ml syringe and homogenize the spleens using a 2 ml syringe plunger.Resuspend the spleens completely until all splenic cells are in solution using the collagenase solution recovered before. Be sure that cells are homogeneously resuspended, then filter the cell suspension through the cell strainer onto the same 50 ml Falcon tube already containing the first cell suspension recovered from spleens treated with 100 U/ml collagenase.Remove the cell strainer and centrifuge (582 x g, 10 min, RT).Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cellular pellet in 15 ml (1 ml/spleen) of a solution composed by 54% of Nycodenz (see Recipes) and 46% of Nycodenz buffer (see Recipes). Divide the obtained cellular suspension in three 15 ml Falcon tubes (5 ml/tube).Carefully overlay 3 ml of RPMI medium in each tube containing 5 ml of the cell suspension (Figure 1A).Centrifuge at 1,811 x g, 15 min, 4 °C without brake.Recover the ring at the interface of the two phases using a Pasteur pipette and transfer the cells into a new 50 ml Falcon tube (Figure 1B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170914/20170914182922_0431.jpgFigure 1.

    "Density gradient of splenic cells after the centrifugation: the ring at the interface contains CD11c+ dendritic cells.Add 10 ml of RPMI medium and centrifuge at 582 x g, 10 min, RT. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cellular pellet in 10 ml of complete RPMI.Count cells and centrifuge again at 582 x g, 10 min, RT. Usually, the recovery is about 100 x 106 cells from one spleen.Resuspend cell pellet in 8.5 µl of ice-cold MACS buffer per 107 total cells.Add 1.5 µl of CD11c Microbeads per 107 total cells.Mix well and incubate for 15 min at 4 °C.Wash cells by adding 1-2 ml of ice-cold MACS buffer per 107 cells and centrifuge at 582 x g, 10 min, RT.Resuspend up to 108 cells in 500 µl of ice-cold MACS buffer. Proceed with magnetic separation. Place column in the magnetic field and rinse with the appropriate amount of buffer: MS column 500 µl (up to 108 cells), LS column 3 ml (from 108 cells to 109 cells).Apply cell suspension onto the column. Discard unlabeled cells which pass through and wash column with the appropriate amount of buffer.

    "Usually, the recovery of CD11c+ cells is about 1 x 106 cells from one spleen.Resuspend cells (1.5 x 106 cells/ml) in complete RPMI and plate 4 ml/well in a 6-well plate. Incubate CD11c+ cells overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2.Co-culture of MDSCs and CD11c+ DCsFor a co-culture of MDSCs and CD11c+ DCs at a 1:2 ratio:Recover and count CD11c+ cells. Resuspend 1 x 106 cells in 700 µl of complete RPMI. Plate cells in a 24-well plate. Consider 1 x 106 CD11c+ cells for each sample of the co-culture (i.e., CD11c+ alone, CD11c+ co-cultured with untreated MDSCs and CD11c+ co-cultured with MDSCs treated with Nor-NOHA to inhibit Arg1 enzymatic activity).Put onto each well containing CD11c+ cells a transwell filled with 100 µl of complete RPMI (without MDSCs) and incubate for 1 h at 37 °C.In the meanwhile, incubate MDSCs 1 x 106 cells/ml with the appropriate stimulus (i.e., with and without 150 µM Nor-NOHA to inhibit Arg1 enzymatic activity) for 1 h at 37 °C, then recover and centrifuge MDSCs (582 x g, 10 min, RT).Resuspend MDSCs 0.5 x 106 cells in 100 µl of complete RPMI.Add 100 µl of MDSCs suspension into the appropriated transwell and incubate overnight at 37 °C.Recover MDSCs and CD11c+ cells and supernatants and perform the desired analysis (i.e., a delayed-type hypersensitivity assay using a skin test (Mondanelli et al., 2017) to assess the functional phenotype of CD11c DCs after the co-culture with MDSCs)."
