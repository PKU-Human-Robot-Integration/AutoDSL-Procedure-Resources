    "1. Culture of Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs)\nPrepare MEF medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, high-glucose), supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS).\nCoat 100 mm cell culture dishes with 0.5% gelatin solution for 30 min at room temperature (RT).\nCount MEFs using a cytometer. Remove the gelatin solution and immediately pour MEF medium pre-warmed to 37 °C. Rapidly thaw vials of mitomycin C-treated MEFs in a 37 °C water bath for 2 min, then seed 2.8 x 106 MEFs per 100 mm gelatin-coated dish. Adjust cell number accordingly if using dishes of other sizes. Incubate MEFs overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nChange the medium on the next day. Culture for 2-3 days until the MEF layer is confluent.\n2. Mouse ESC Culture\nPrepare ESC medium, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) supplemented with 15% FBS and 103 U/mL leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 55 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, penicillin (100 U/mL), streptomycin (100 µg/mL), gentamicin (200 µg/mL), and 0.2% mycoplasma antibiotic.\nRemove MEF medium from the dish prepared in step 1 and replace with 37 °C pre-warmed ESC medium.\nDefrost an ESC vial and seed cells on top of the MEF layer. Incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2, until ESCs reach confluence.\nPrepare new cell culture dishes containing a confluent monolayer of MEFs. To passage the ESCs, wash once with PBS and detach with 0.25% trypsin/EDTA for 2-5 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Stop the trypsinization by adding fresh IMDM with 15% FBS to the detaching cells, transfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL tube, and centrifuge at 160 x g for 5 min at RT.\nRemove the supernatant, resuspend ESCs with fresh IMDM and passage one fifth of the cells to each new MEF-coated dish; incubate until cells reach confluence (typically 4-5 days).",
    "3. Withdraw MEFs and Culture ESCs on Gelatin-coated Plates\nOnce ECSs reached confluence, detach them and MEFs with 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA as in step 2.4, resuspend the cells in fresh IMDM, transfer to a non-adhesive bacteriological petri dish, and incubate for 40 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nCarefully transfer ESCs and MEFs-containing medium to a new gelatin-coated plate using a 5 mL pipette, avoiding repeated pipetting. The cells remaining in the petri dishes are MEFs, since ESCs do not adhere.\nPassage the ESCs every 3-4 days. Less frequent passaging may reduce ESC pluripotency. Do not exceed 60% confluence, as it may favor differentiation.\nRepeat steps 3.2-3.3 three times or more, as required, until MEFs are no longer detectable by a cell culture microscope, using a 20X objective, to make sure MEFs are not present.\nVerify ESC pluripotency by checking ESC culture to see if the cells form dense colonies with typical ESC polygonal morphology (Figure 1A). Test cell stemness by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)17, immunoblotting17, or immunofluorescence of core pluripotency transcription factors17 (Figure 2).\n4. EB Formation\nPrepare all-trans-RA stock solution at 10 mM in DMSO, and aliquot into 1.5 mL light-protected microfuge tubes. The solution is stable at -80 °C for up to two weeks. Protect it from light.\nTrypsinize ESCs as in step 2.4; replate in fresh IMDM without LIF, as a single-cell suspension.\nCount cells using a hemocytometer, and prepare a 5 x 105 cells/mL suspension in IMDM with 0.5 µM RA.\nPlate 100 20-µL-drops per 100-mm petri dish with an 8-channel pipette and 200 µL tips, invert the dishes, and fill the inverted lid with PBS to prevent hanging drops from drying. Protect RA-containing culture media from light.\nCulture EBs in hanging drops at 37 °C, 5% CO2, for 4 days.",
    "5. 2D EB Culture\nCoat 12 mm circular glass coverslips with 30 µg/mL fibronectin for 30 min at RT. Place each coverslip in a well of a 24-well plate, and add 1 mL IMDM per well.\nHarvest 3 day-grown hanging drop EBs one by one with 200 µL pipette tips and seed them on the fibronectin-coated coverslips, 20 EBs per well, using the same pipette tips.\n\tNOTE: 3-day EBs are preferable over 4-day EBs because they adhere better to the coverslips.\nContinue culture with IMDM-15% FBS without LIF. Replace medium every 3-4 days. Collect the used medium for protein secretion analysis as needed.\n6. Detection of Secreted Proteins\nTransfer 500 µL of EB medium to 10 kDa-cutoff centrifugal filters, spin at 20,000 x g for 60 min at 4 °C.\nExamine the medium remaining inside the centrifugal filters every 15-20 min to prevent excessive enrichment. Stop centrifugation when the volume of the remaining medium has fallen to 25 µL.\nCollect the remaining concentrated medium after inverting the filter and spinning at 160 x g at 4 °C, following the manufacturer's instructions.\nDetect the secreted proteins by immunoblotting with specific antibodies17.\n7. 3D EB Culture\nCollect the EBs grown for 4 days in hanging drops as described in step 5.2, and place them in 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes (30 EBs per tube).\nPrepare collagen gel solution following the instructions of the 3D collagen culture kit (see Materials/Equipment Table). Dilute appropriate volumes of collagen solution and 5x DMEM (a kit component); add the neutralization solution (a kit component) and mix well immediately, and keep this on ice.\nPipette an appropriate volume of chilled collagen solution into the 1.5 mL tube containing the EBs, and gently transfer to the wells of a 6-well plate using a 1 mL pipette tip. Avoid making bubbles.",
    "Immediately transfer the plate to 37 °C, 5% CO2, for 60 min to initiate collagen polymerization.\nOverlay the EB-containing plate with IMDM.\nChange medium every 3-4 days.\n8. EB Dissociation\nCollect the day 4 EBs (from step 4) one by one, with 200 µL pipette tips and transfer them to a non-adhesive bacteriological petri dish containing IMDM with 15% FBS; culture at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 4 more days. Check the EBs twice every day to make sure they do not attach to the bottom; gently shake the dish to prevent EB attachment to the bottom.\nCentrifuge the EBs at 185 x g for 5 min at RT, in a benchtop centrifuge.\nRemove the supernatants. The pellet should not exceed 100 µL in each tube.\nAdd to pelleted EBs 1 mL 0.25% type I collagenase per tube, supplemented with 20% FBS in PBS.\nIncubate the EB-collagenase mixture for 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, pipetting it gently every 20 min, using 1 mL pipette tips.\nWash the cells gently 3x with PBS. If cell aggregates are present, use a cell strainer with a 100-µm mesh to remove them.\nReplate the cells on a gelatin-coated 60 mm dishes in IMDM. Then incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\n9. Transfection of Dissociated EBs\nFor qRT-PCR and immunoblotting, coat a 6-well plate with 0.5% gelatin.\nFor immunofluorescence, coat glass coverslips with 30 µg/mL fibronectin for 30 min at RT. Place each coverslip in a well of a 24-well plate. Add IMDM.\nSeed 4.75 x 105 or 1 x 105 dissociated EB cells (steps 8.4-8.7) per well in 6- or 24-well plates, respectively.\nGrow the cells to 70% confluence before transfection.\nTransfect the cells by a nonliposomal lipid stem-cell-optimal reagent17 (see Materials/Equipment Table), following the manufacturer's instructions.",
    "NOTE: The reagent we used typically reached a transfection efficiency of 50% (see Representative Results).\nAnalyze the samples by qRT-PCR or by immunoblotting17 2 or 3 days after transfection, respectively.\n10. Analysis of EB Differentiation by Immunofluorescence\nWash 2D EBs or dissociated 3D EBs with PBS and fix with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at RT. Wash the fixed cells 3x with PBS to remove floating cell debris.\n\tNOTE: Paraformaldehyde is a skin and eye irritant; use caution when handling it.\nAdd 1% triton X-100 in PBS to permeabilize the cells for 20 mins at RT, then wash 3x with PBS.\nRemove PBS and block with 5% BSA in PBS for 30 min.\nPrepare primary antibody dilution in 1% BSA/PBS supplemented with 0.03% triton X-100. Replace the blocking solution by the primary antibody solution. Incubate for 3 h at RT, or overnight at 4 °C, then wash cells 3x with PBS.\nApply secondary antibody in PBS according to the manufacturer's instructions. Incubate for 1 h at RT, then wash cells 3x with PBS.\nMount coverslips on glass slides with an anti-fade medium for optical microscopy.\nSubscription Required.
