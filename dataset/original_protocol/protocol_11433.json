    "We follow European standards for the use of animals for scientific purposes. This study was approved by the local Ethics committee (#3097-2015120414583482v3).\n1. Sample preparation\nCollect bone marrow (2 mL) from de novo AML in tubes containing the anticoagulant ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) at a concentration of 1.8 mg per mL of bone marrow.\nPerform Ficoll separation, a density gradient separation to isolate mononuclear cells from red cells and granulocytes, as followed. Dilute bone marrow in 3 volumes of phosphate buffer saline (PBS: NaCl 137 mM, KCl 2.7 mM, Na2HPO4 10mM, KH2PO4 1.8 mM). Carefully overlay 1 volume of Ficoll with 1 volume of diluted bone marrow. Spin 30 minutes at 300 x g without brake. Transfer the white buffy coat layer of mononucleated cells into a new sterile tube.\nWash cells twice in 10 mL of PBS) and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min, in order to remove contaminating serum components.\n2. Lysis of red blood cells (RBC)\nAdd 2 mL of lysis buffer (ammonium chloride 0.8%) to the cell pellet, vortex gently and incubate at room temperature for 5 min. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min.\n\tNote: if necessary, repeat this step.\nWash cells in PBS as previously described (1.3.).\n3. Patient derived xenografts.\nObtain blast cells from bone marrow after Ficoll separation and after lymphocytes depletion using immunomagnetic negative selection (CD3 for T-, and CD20 for B-lymphocytes). Follow the manufacturer's instructions.",
    "Inject 5 x 106 AML blast cells into the tail vein of unconditioned NSG mice. Use a restraining device to facilitate tail vein injection. Keep mice under conventional conditions and especially under specific-pathogen-free conditions at all times, by using individual ventilated cages and by manipulation under laminar flow hood. Every two weeks, take 60 µL of blood by the submandibular collection method using a hematocrit capillary. Place the capillary into a 5 mL round bottom tube. Stop the bleed by applying gentle pressure using a small sterile gauze pad. Expulse blood with a clean syringe. \nAdd 1ml of lysis buffer and incubate for 5min. Then centrifuge at 300 x g for 5min. Wash with PBS and centrifugre at 300 x g for 5 minutes. Remove supernatant, the add 100 µL PBS with 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) stain with 3 µL anti-human CD45-FITC and 1 µL anti-murine CD45-APC and incubate at 4°C for 30 minutes.\nWash cell pellet two times in PBS (2 mL) with 10% BSA and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min.\nAliquot up to 1 x 106 cells per 100 µL of PBS into flow cytometry tubes.\nSurvey engraftment every two weeks by chimerism analysis of CD45 expression (human versus murine) using flow cytometry (Figure 2A and B).\nAt sacrifice (peripheral blast count greater than 70% or severe clinical signs of sickness), collect mononuclear blast cells from crushed spleens and from bone marrow by flushing tibias and femurs with PBS as previously described13. Euthanize mice by cervical dislocation following international guidelines.   \nIf cell pellet contains RBC, perform lysis of red blood cells with lysis buffer (Step 2.1).\nWash cells pellet two times in PBS (2 mL) with 10% BSA and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 minutes.",
    "Collect cells and aliquot up to 1 x 106 cells per 100 µL of PBS into flow cytometry tubes.\n4. Staining\nAdd conjugated antibodies (see Step 4.2) and vortex. Incubate cells for 15 minutes in the dark at room temperature.\nUse the following panel for human primary or PDX samples consisting of 10 µL of anti-CD36-FITC, 5 µL of anti-CD19-ECD, 5 µL of anti-CD33-PC5.5, 5 µL of anti-CD90-APC, 5 µL of anti-CD34-AA700, 5 µL of anti-CD45RA-APC-H7, 5 µL of anti-CD38-Pacific Blue , 5 µL of anti-CD123-PC7 and 2.5 µL of anti-CD45-KO.\nRemove unbound antibodies by washing the cells in 2 mL of PBS by centrifugation at 300 x g for 5 min.\nRe-suspend cells in 450 µL of PBS for final flow cytometric analysis.\n5. Gating strategy for flow cytometry analysis\nPerform data acquisition (at least 500,000 cells) on a flow cytometer equipped with red, blue and violet lasers. Verify cytometer settings every day for 1) optical alignment, 2) fluidic system, 3) optical sensitivity, and 4) standardization using fluorospheres\nFollow the sequential gating strategy to define CD38 expression (Figure 1).\n\t\nUse cells from normal bone marrow samples to define hematogones or plasma cells which will serve as positive control  for CD38 expression.\n\t\tNote: this gate is especially important to assess as subsequent putative LSC populations depend on its definition.",
    "Define physiologic precursors cells (normal blast cells) by CD45dim/SSC (side scatter) low population criteria (Figure 1A). Within this blast population, define hematogones, which display a CD38++CD19+ phenotype (Figure 1B) and finally, use CD36 and CD33 expression to define myeloblasts, monoblasts, and erythroblasts (Figure 1C). Determine CD34 expression on hematogones as shown in (Figure 1E). Assess several subpopulations of precursors within the blast cells defined as P6-P10 (Figure 1D). Separate the CD34 compartment of blast cells into P6, P7, P8 progenitor subpopulations based on preset CD38 gates. Ensure that the P8 compartment contains the blasts that have the same CD38 intensity as the hematogones, that P6 includes cells which are CD38-based on the CD38 fluorescence minus one (FMO) control and that P7 cells are in between the two extremes with regard to CD38 expression (Figure 1D).\nFrom the CD34+38- (P6) gated cells, separate HSC from putative LSC using CD90 and CD45RA expression (Figure 1F).\n\tNote: the HSC phenotype is CD34+CD38-CD90+CD45RA- and the multipotent progenitors (MPP) are defined as CD34+CD38-CD90-CD45RA-. The putative LSC phenotype is CD34+CD38-CD90dimCD45RA+ and the more immature downstream population are the lymphoid-primed progenitors (LMPP) defined as CD34+CD38-CD90-CD45RA+.\n6. MRD monitoring by RT-PCR\nMonitor MRD levels by RT-PCR as described previously14.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
