    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nEstablishing sterol-defined C. elegans cultures\nTiming: 3 days—when done at 20°C\nThis step aims to grow, for one generation (three days), a synchronized population of C. elegans in liquid culture supplemented with the sterol of interest or a vehicle (ethanol) control. The cultured C. elegans is harvested for downstream GC-MS analysis. A 100 mL of culture per condition should be prepared. Each such 100 mL culture gives approximately 330 mg of worm pellet that is sufficient for several GC-MS analyses.\nEstablishing the culture.\nTo a 250 mL Erlenmeyer, add 100 mL S-complete medium, 2 mL from the NA22 bacterial food, the sterol of interest at 13 μM culture concentration, and 100,000 arrested, synchronized, and bacteria-free L1 larvae.\nCritical: The synchronized L1-arrested larvae should not be used earlier than 16 h post-bleach or later than 72 h of incubation in S-basal at 20°C. Incubation shorter than 16 h may result in the miscalculation of the number of worms in the culture (see below), whereas culturing the L1 worms for more than 72 h may affect their survival, health, and the level of synchronization.\nSpit the 100 mL nematode culture into two 250 mL Erlenmeyer vessels (i.e., 50 mL into each vessel), cover the Erlenmeyer's opening with aluminum foil, and incubate on a shaker agitating at 175 rpm for about 3 days at 20°C.\nCritical: The concentration of the worms in the culture should be about one worm per μl. More than three worms per μl may cause the worms in the culture to develop into the dauer diapause stage (Antebi, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), whereas cultures that are too diluted will result in an insufficient amount of worm pellet for the GC-MS analysis.\nHarvesting, cleaning, and storing the cultured worms.",
    "After 48 h, check the developmental stage of the worms in order to harvest the culture when most worms are young adults with a few eggs. This point in time usually occurs around 72 h after the establishment of the culture but it can vary. Ideally, monitor the culture microscopically every 6 h.\nTransfer the culture to two new 50 mL sterile plastic tubes and place them in an ice bucket for 30 minutes until a pellet is visible—this pellet contains mostly adult worms.\nCarefully aspirate the liquid phase without disturbing the pellet. Add 40 mL of S- basal buffer, leave on ice for 30 minutes, and aspirate the liquid. Repeat until the upper phase becomes clear (usually 4 washes).\nNote: The washing steps aim to clean the adult worms from bacteria and enrich the culture for adult C. elegans, which sink more easily than eggs or young larvae.\nAdd another 40mL of S-basal medium, seal the tube with a parafilm laboratory tape, place the tubes horizontally on a shaker and agitate at 175 rpm for 2 h at 20°C.\nNote: The two-hour incubation after the washing steps aims to clean as much as possible the alimentary canal of the worms from bacteria.\nPlace the tubes in an ice bucket for 30 minutes, carefully aspirate the liquid without disturbing the pellet, add a further 40 mL of S-basal solution, and place the tubes in an ice bucket again as above.\nRepeat step 2e two more times.\nTransfer the worm pellet to pre-weighed 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes that have been pre-cooled in an ice bucket. Use a diamond knife to break the end of a Pasteur Pipette and, using this pipette, transfer the pellet of adults to the tubes. Each tube should contain about 500 μL of loose worm pellet.",
    "Critical: The use of 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes is important for the extraction procedure (see below). Do not use the standard 1.7 mL tubes.\nNote: The 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes will be used for sterol extraction. In chemical analysis protocols it is commonly advised to use glassware rather than plasticware in order to avoid chemical contaminants. Nevertheless, to analyze a large number of small biological samples, the use of glass tubes might be challenging. To control for possible contaminants, it is highly advisable to use the same type of plasticware for blanks, standards, and samples. Moreover, the specific plasticware used should be tested for contaminants for each analyte and in case of contamination extraction should be conducted using glassware.\nSpin the tubes at maximal speed and immediately aspirate the liquid. Repeat centrifugation and aspiration until the tube contains only the compact worm pellet (about 300 μL in volume).\nPause point: Samples can be stored at −80°C indefinitely until required for use.\nUncap the tubes with the worm pellets and place them in a lyophilizer, weigh the pellets every hour until there is no more weight loss due to evaporation. In our Heto FD3 freeze dryer, this takes 2 h, but time may vary with vacuum strength.\nWeigh the tubes with the dry worm pellets and store them at −80°C until required for use. The dry weight of the pellet will be used to normalize the samples in the quantification step (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nPause point: Lyophilized Samples can be stored indefinitely at −80°C until required for use.",
    "Note: To analyze worms that feed on a particular dietary sterol, worms should be cultured in the presence of this sterol for at least two generations in order for the mothers to transfer only the sterol of interest to the offspring. We usually grow cultures for ten generations on a specific sterol before the experiment. However, because C. elegans cannot grow to adulthood for more than one generation without sterols (Merris et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9], Matyash et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]), the culture of vehicle (ethanol) control worms can only be grown for one generation.\nAlternatives: Sucrose floatation is an alternative method to clean C. elegans cultures from bacteria, carcasses, and debris (Russell et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). However, sucrose floatation typically results in the loss of many adult worms. Moreover, the high osmolarity of sucrose may affect downstream procedures like sterol extraction. Thus, it is advisable to use gentler washing procedures as described here, rather than sucrose floatation.\nLipid extraction and derivatization\nTiming: 6 h\nIn this step, lipids are extracted from the dry pellets of C. elegans and the extracts undergo derivatization to enable the detection of sterols by the GC-MS instrument.\nSaponifying the samples\nSubject the pellets to three cycles of −80°C freezing and room-temperature thawing to break the cuticle of the worms.\nTo each sample, add 500 μL of analytical-grade ethanol containing 4 μg of the internal standard; in our protocol, the internal standard is coprostanol (Merris et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).",
    "Critical: It is critical to use internal standards to assess the efficacy of the extraction, derivatization, and detection steps. Not only is an internal standard essential for the comparison of the levels of sterols between samples, but it is also required for quantitative studies of sterols in the same sample (Mitsche et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). Before using a specific internal standard, perform one GC-MS analysis of the standard to find the retention time of the internal standard peak. Next, a worm sample should be analyzed to confirm that the internal standard is absent in worms. Finally, a C. elegans sample with the added internal standard should be analyzed to ensure that the peak of the internal standard does not overlap with any of the peaks of sterols of interest (for example, cholesterol in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/917-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Representative GC-MS chromatographs of worm samples with and without an internal standard\n(A) C. elegans samples without any internal standard.\n(B) C. elegans samples with the coprostanol internal standard. No endogenous coprostanol is detected (arrow in A) and the retention time is different between the internal standard and C. elegans sterols as shown in panel B (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] for more sterols).\nAdd 50 μL of freshly made 10N aqueous NaOH to each 2 mL tube. Secure the cap of each tube with a microcentrifuge tube holder and incubate the tubes at 70°C for 1 h. Next, move the tubes to a 43°C water bath for three minutes.\nCritical: Securing the tube caps is critical to protect the samples from a spillover caused by ethanol that evaporates at 70°C. Alternatively use screw-cap tubes.\nExtracting lipids from the sample",
    "After the tubes are cooled to ∼20°C, open carefully to avoid spillover, and add 250 μL of ddH2O to each tube, mix and add 500 μL of hexane.\nCap and seal the tubes with a parafilm laboratory film, vortex for one minute, and spin at 4,000 g for five minutes.\nUsing a tip, carefully collect the upper (organic) phase of each tube, about 500 μL in volume, and transfer to a new 2 mL microcentrifuge tube. Repeat steps 4a–c two more times, combining the organic phases.\nAdd 500 μL of water to each tube that contains the organic phase, and repeat fractionation as in step 2b. This step washes the hexane fraction from carryovers.\nCarefully aspirate the hexane upper phase and transfer to a new gas chromatography glass screw-thread vial (e.g., 9 mm wide vials).\nCritical: Be sure not to take any of the lower aqueous phases because water is a strong inhibitor of the derivatization reaction.\nDry the hexane with N2 gas flow in a fume hood. Typically, sterols are dried out as white sediments on the walls just above the bottom of the vial.\nCritical: Be sure that no water in any form (drops, vapor, etc.) is left in the tube because the derivatization process is inhibited by water.\nDerivatization of the lipids\nAdd 50 μL of BSTFA to each sample and cap the vials with PTFE/silicon caps.\nCritical: The BSTFA should be fresh for the optimal derivatization of substrates.\nIncubate the vials in an 80°C dry block for 30 minutes.\nAdd 150 μL of hexane to each vial, mix to dissolve sterols that are on the vials' walls, and cap the vials. Preferably, samples should be analyzed immediately in the GC-MS instrument.",
    "Pause point: It is advisable not to pause during the extraction and derivatization steps. If necessary, samples after derivatization can be stored at −20°C for up to 3 days before the GC-MS analysis (longer storage may result in sample degradation or solvate evaporation).\nGC-MS analysis\nTiming: 2 h per sterol\nThe GC-MS analysis aims to identify specific sterols in samples of interest and to quantify sterol levels within and between samples.\nBuilding a GC-MS program for the separation of the different sterols\nUsing a mix of sterol standards, build a GC-MS program for the separation and characterization of sterols (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/917-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Representative GC-MS chromatographs of a mix of extracted standard sterols\nFor GC-MS analysis we choose standards for the primary plant, fungal, and animal sterols as well as some intermediates of sterol metabolism in C. elegans and an internal standard (Coprostanol). 1. Coprostanol; 2. Cholesterol; 3. Desmosterol; 4. 7-dehydrocholesterol; 5. Ergosterol; 6. Stigmasterol; 7. β-sitosterol.\nGC details (these may vary by the type of the GC-MS instrument and column used): we used a gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, 7890A), equipped with a Rxi-5Sil MS capillary column (Restek, 13623). The GC was coupled to a single-quad mass spectrometer detector (Agilent technologies, 5975C).\nProgram details: set the oven temperature to 70°C, raising to 250°C at a rate of 20°C per minute, and then from 250°C to 320°C at 10°C per minute, and then hold at 320°C for 10 minutes. Set injector temperature to 280°C and let the carrier gas (helium) flow at 1 mL/minute−1. Use a splitless injection with a purge time of 1 minute to inject a 2 μL volume of each sample by an auto-sampler.\nCritical: The injector temperature should be higher than 250°C for the sterols to evaporate.",
    "Set the mass spectrometer transfer line to 320°C, the ion source temperature to 230°C, and the single-quad mass spectrometer detector temperature to 150°C in a scan mode, from 40 to 550 m/z.\nNote: If peak fronting or tailing appears, samples can be injected in split mode, although this could result in a lower sensitivity of detection and the loss of the detection of minor peaks, such as the 7-dehydrocholesterol in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nIdentifying and quantifying different sterols.\nDetermine the retention time (the time where the molecule leaves the column and reaches the detector) of each sterol. Comparison to the retention time of known standards can reveal the identity of the sterols of interest (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nIdentification by retention times, however, should be further validated through fragmentation patterns. MS analysis involves the breakages of the molecules that reach the detector to smaller ion fragments. Dependent on the original structure of the molecule, this fragmentation pattern can be used to distinguish between different molecules with the same retention time (for example 7-dehydrocholesterol and desmosterol (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] and step 7f)). Validate sterol identity by comparing the fragmentation patterns of the sterols of interest obtained by scan mode screening from 40 to 550 m/z (step 6d), with published reference spectra.\nBuild a calibration curve for every sterol of interest by dissolving its purified commercial standard in ethanol in a designated quantity. In our GC-MS instrument, we use a range between 7.81 and 125 μg/mL but the exact range is instrument-dependent. Calculate the peak area for every concentration, build a calibration curve (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]), and calculate the calibration equation for each sterol (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/917-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Calibration curves of different standard sterols",
    "Sterols were weighed and dissolved in ethanol and diluted to the designated quantities. Each calibration curve is based on three independent experiments. Error bars represent standard deviation (Std.) that for some points are too small to be visualized as bars in the graphs.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_917_8.csv\nThe calibration equations were obtained from the calibration curves (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]) of three independent GC-MS analyses.\nNote: As expected, the GC-MS analysis shows that the supplemented dietary sterol is the predominant peak in each sample but peaks of endogenous sterols are also detected (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nFor every extraction procedure, calculate by GC-MS analysis the level of the internal standard before and after extraction to estimate the extraction efficiency.\nQuantify the level of each sterol of interest by placing the value of its peak area in the line equation obtained from the calibration curve (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] and Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). Correct the value according to the extraction efficiency of the internal standard and divide the value by the dry weight of the sample (see Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] and Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_917_9.csv\nThe calculation of quantities is based on the peak area of each sterol and its calibration curve equation (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]), divided by the extraction efficiency of the internal standard.\naAreas of desmosterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol were estimated as described below.\nCritical: If the peak area of a given sterol is outside the range of the calibration curve sterol concentration cannot be calculated accurately. In this case, dilute or concentrate the sample to fit the range of the calibration curve.\nNote: In some studies, normalization is based on the endogenous level of a single or group of biomolecules (e.g., total phospholipids). However, because changes in sterols metabolism can affect the level of many different metabolites including phospholipids it is better to normalize to dry weight.",
    "The peaks of desmosterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol overlap (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) preventing their distinction by retention time. However, the analysis of pure standards of the two sterols in scan mode revealed two ions of M/Z ratio 372.7 and 373.3, detected in desmosterol but not in 7-dehydrocholesterol (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). A constant ratio of 0.0042 between the accumulative area of the desmosterol-specific peaks and total ions peak (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]) was determined. This ratio allows the estimation of the desmosterol fraction of the shared peak. For example, in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], the total-ion peak area is 8,009,974. The area of the same peak when only the 372.7 and 373.3 ions are accounted for is 23,612. Using the 0.0042 ratio, the desmosterol-specific peak area is calculated to be 5,582,508 (23,612/0.0042). The subtraction of the peak area of desmosterol from the area of the total peak reveals the peak area of 7-dehydrocholesterol (8,009,974 - 5,582,508 = 2,427,466), resulting in 1.19 μg and 0.18 μg respectively (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]). We used the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST11 library (Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]) as a source for fragmentation patterns of standard sterols.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/917-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Fragmentation pattern and the identification of specific MS ions for desmosterol\n(A) The fragmentation pattern of 7-dehydrocholesterol.\n(B) Analysis of the fragmentation pattern of desmosterol reveals two ions, 372.7 and 373.3 that are not detected in 7-dehydrocholesterol (inserts in A and B). We used these specific ions to calculate the levels of the two sterols (step 7f). Specific ions were selected only if they were separated from main ions mass in more than 0.05 units. For example, the specific ions around 366 in 7-dehydrocholesterol (insert in A) cannot be used to distinguish it from desmosterol because they are too close to the mass of the 366 ion.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_917_10.csv",
    "The ratios of peak areas were obtained by subtracting the desmosterol-peak area from the total-peak area. This ratio enables the calculation of the amount of both desmosterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol in the samples.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_917_11.csv\nTable columns are sterol names; molecular formula (MF) and molecular weight (MW; g/mol); molecular structures before and after derivatization; percentages of similarity to the NIST11 database; retention times; and major ions detected in the GC-MS analysis (m/z)."
