    "1. Design of pattern templates\nNOTE: Templates for patterning are generated with digital drawing software (Table of Materials). Drawing in different grey levels will determine laser intensities. Using software to design pattern templates allows rapid generation of patterns with any desired geometry and gradients (Figure 3).\nDigitally draw the desired pattern template using drawing software. Select an image size of 1824 pixels length and 1140 pixels width (which in this study corresponds to 415 µm length and 260 µm width). Save the pattern template as an 8-bit Tiff file.\n\tNOTE: a step-by-step protocol to generate templates is available upon request to the brand who commercializes the micro-patterning equipment (Table of Materials).\n2. Plasma cleaning\nNOTE: Optimal results require plasma cleaning of the surfaces prior to patterning, which will remove all organic matter and activate the surface. In the present case, ambient air is sufficient for surface activation. A plasma cleaner (Table of Materials) was used with a process pressure of 1000-1300 mTorr and a power of 29.6 W for 1-5 min.\nUse glass bottom dish/es with a 20 mm inner well size and glass thickness of 0.16-0.19 mm. For testing multiple conditions, use a 6-well glass bottom dish. Otherwise, use a single well glass bottom dish (Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: A step-by-step protocol for plasma cleaning is available upon request to the brand who commercializes the plasma cleaning equipment (Table of Materials).\n3. Passivation\nNOTE: This step generates an antifouling film that prevents protein adsorption to the glass surface. PEG offers high resistance to protein adsorption29 as an antifouling agent. LIMAP uses a photo-initiator to locally remove PEG through UV photoscission. The protein/s of interest will then adsorb to these PEG-free surfaces21, generating micro-patterns.\nPassivation with PLL-PEG",
    "Under sterile conditions, cut the PDMS stencils (see Figure 4A,B and Table of Materials) to ensure they fit in the inner glass bottom well, and remove the inner micro-well fillings with sterile forceps. Stick stencils on the glass well using forceps.\nEnsure that the stencils stick tightly on the glass well, preventing the formation of air bubbles that can cause leakages during the passivation process.\n\t\tNOTE: PDMS stencils can also be fabricated in-house using published protocols18,32.\nPrepare PLL-PEG solution (Table of Materials, 0.1 mg/mL) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Add 20 µL of PLL-PEG solution to each micro-well and incubate at room temperature, for 1 h.\nRemove 15 µL of PLL-PEG from the micro-wells and wash them five times with 20 µL of PBS (Table of Materials) without letting them dry.\n\t\tNOTE: Always leave approximately 5 µL of PBS in between washes. Given their small volume, the micro-wells are particularly susceptible to drying. Drying will result in micro-patterns of poor quality.\nEither keep the culture dish in PBS (3 mL per well) at 4 °C for up to 3 days or continue with the next step (step 3.1.5).\nRemove 18 µL of PBS from a single micro-well (for example, the top left micro-well, see Figure 4D), add 5 µL of photo-initiator (PLPP, Table of Materials) and leave 20 µL of PBS in the remaining micro-wells. This micro-well with PLPP will be used to create a reference pattern (see Figure 4D,E) during the system calibration step (step 4). Keep PLPP protected from light.\nPassivation with long-lasting PEG-SVA",
    "NOTE: To generate the anti-adhesive surface one can use: 1) a PEG linked to Poly-L-Lysine (PLL-PEG, step 3.1) or 2) a PEG-succinate N-hydroxisuccinimide (PEG-SVA). The decision to choose one or the other passivation option depends on the storage options (see step 10). Culture dishes incubated with PEG-SVA require double amount of passivation and photopatterning time.\n\t\nPrepare stencils as described in step 3.1.1.\nAdd 20 µL of 0.01% Poly-L-Lysine (PLL, Table of Materials) to each micro-well and incubate at room temperature for 30 min to pre-coat with PLL.\nRemove 15 µL of PLL from the micro-wells and wash them three times with 20 µL of 1 M HEPES buffer (Table of Materials) without letting the wells dry out.\n\t\tNOTE: Always leave approximately 5 µL of HEPES or PBS in between washes. Given their small volume, the micro-wells are particularly susceptible to drying. Drying will result in micro-patterns of poor quality.\nPrepare PEG-SVA solution. PEG-SVA solution (50 mg/mL in HEPES buffer 1M) should be prepared fresh each time immediately before use. Prepare 20 µL of PEG-SVA per micro-well.\nHEPES buffer must have a pH between 8-8.5. Test HEPES pH prior to preparing the PEG-SVA solution with pH paper. Weigh PEG-SVA in a centrifuge tube using a precision scale. Add HEPES buffer and vortex 30 s until dissolved. PEG-SVA is completely dissolved when the solution is transparent.\n\t\tNOTE: SVA is the ester that allows binding of PEG to the previously coated PLL. Once the HEPES buffer is added to the PEG-SVA, the SVA has a half-life of 15 min and should be used immediately.",
    "Add 20 µL of PEG-SVA solution to each micro-well and incubate at room temperature, for 1 h. Remove 15 µL of PEG-SVA from the micro-wells and wash five times with 20 µL of PBS (Table of Materials) without letting the wells dry out.\nEither prepare the culture dish for long-term storage (up to 1 month, see step 10.2) or proceed to the next step (step 3.2.8).\nRemove 18 µL of PBS from a single micro-well (for example, the top left micro-well, see Figure 4D), add 5 µL of PLPP (Table of Materials) and leave 20 µL of PBS in the remaining micro-wells. This micro-well will be used to create a reference pattern (see Fi gure 4D, E). Ensure that PLPP is homogenous on the whole surface of the micro-well. Keep PLPP protected from light.\n4. System calibration\nNOTE: In these steps, the focus of the laser will be adjusted to the particular type of culture dish (step 4.1). A reference pattern will be generated in only one micro-well (step 4.2) followed by incubation with a protein solution (step 4.3) to ensure the optimal focus conditions of the laser (step 4.4), necessary to obtain sharp and defined patterns.\nLaser calibration\n\tNOTE: During the calibration process, a calibration laser image will be projected onto a fluorescently-highlighted glass surface (calibration well, marked with a fluorescent highlighter, Figure 4C), which needs to be placed in focus on the microscope.\n\t\nUse a fluorescent highlighter (Table of Materials) to mark an empty inner glass well.\n\t\tNOTE: The calibration well must have the same glass thickness (0.16-0.19 mm) as the culture dish on which micro-patterns will be generated. If a 6-well glass bottom dish is being used, an empty well can be used for calibration and should be marked with fluorescent highlighter under sterile conditions.",
    "Switch on the microscope, the stage and the computer. Switch on the PRIMO micro-patterning equipment, open Micro-manager and Leonardo software. Leonardo software is operated through Micro-manager under Plugins. Check the brands/catalogue numbers of equipment and software in Table of Materials.\nIn the initial menu of Leonardo, select Calibrate. Check that the dedicated PRIMO filter cube is in the correct position (optical path) in the filter turret; select the 20X objective (0.75 DIC S Plan Fluor, no phase ring) both on the microscope and on Leonardo software.\n\t\tNOTE: This protocol is adjusted to Leonardo version 4.4. The protocol may need adjusting for other versions.\nPosition the previously highlighted calibration well (Figure 4C) above the objective. Select camera path. Adjust the objective focus until the laser projection of both the PRIMO logo and the tag line Take care of your cells are in focus.\nLeave default camera exposure time at 25 ms. Adjust the laser intensity to see the letter I from the PRIMO logo projection in grey color and the rest of the letters in white.\nRecord the Z-position of the focal plane, (height of the objective to the sample) later referred to as Z-position of calibration. This will be an approximation to the optimal focus obtained after reference pattern generation (see step 4.2-4.4).\nReference pattern\nPosition the culture dish with the micro-well containing the photo-initiator (reference pattern micro-well, Figure 4D) above the objective and select Pattern now in the Leonardo software.\nVisualize the edge of the micro-well with transmitted light through the camera and choose the ROI symbol from the right-hand menu. Set the diameter of the ROI circle to 4000 µm and align the edge of the digital ROI with the edge of the current micro-well.",
    "Ensure that there is an accurate overlap between the digital ROI and the current micro-well by moving the stage around the edges of the micro-well. The ROI position will be coupled to the stage movements.\nSelect Lock in Leonardo software to lock the ROI in the desired position. Switch off the transmitted light.\nSelect PRIMO to upload the desired pattern template, which will be projected on the ROI as a design unit (see Figure 5). Patterns will appear in a dropdown list referred to as Actions and shown in the Actions menu on the software.\n\t\tNOTE: Pattern templates need to be designed previously (see step 1) and saved as an 8-bit Tiff file before loading the template in the software.\nOnly a small pattern is needed for the reference pattern; for example, 3 lines, 1 column (see Figure 4E and Figure 5B). In the Replication menu, set the desired number of columns and rows (Lines in Leonardo software). Click Refresh to observe a digital preview of the pattern design.\nSet the laser dose in the Replication menu. The optimal laser dose in this setting and using PLL-PEG is 1390 mJ/mm2.\n\t\tNOTE: Laser power can vary between 5-7.5 mW/mm2. In this case, it is 7.5 mW/mm2, which takes approximately 30 s to pattern each design unit, using a laser dose of 1390 mJ/mm2. Higher laser doses may be required if the culture dish surface is passivated with PEG-SVA (approximately double laser dose compared to PLL-PEG). This needs to be tested beforehand.\nNavigate to a peripheral region of the micro-well, (for example, top part) away from the main region of interest for pattern generation (central region) of the micro-well (see Figure 4E) and select Lock. Wait until the pattern is displayed.\nAdjust the focus to the Z-position of calibration (see step 4.1.6).",
    "NOTE: It is recommended to do an additional system calibration step if another user is using the same microscope between photopatterning rounds.\nSelect the Play symbol to start patterning. Ensure the laser is on in the software. Wait until the patterning process is finished. Patterning duration will be displayed in the Estimated Time panel. On Leonardo software version 4.4 patterning is completed when all Actions appear blue in the Visualization menu.\nProtein incubation on reference pattern\nUnder sterile conditions, wash the reference pattern micro-well three times with 20 µL of PBS to remove the PLPP.\nAdd 20 µL of fluorescently-labeled ECM protein (10 µg/mL laminin, fibronectin or fibrinogen in PBS, see Table of Materials and step 6) to the reference pattern micro-well. Incubate at room temperature for 10-20 min (depending on the protein) protected from light (wrap the dish in aluminum foil).\nAfter incubation, remove 18 µL of protein solution and wash three times with 20 µL of PBS; keep the micro-wells that are not used to create a reference pattern (see Figure 4D,E) in 20 µL of PBS.\nVisualization and setting optimal laser focus\nVisualize the reference pattern using an epifluorescence microscope, 20X objective and suitable software (check software used in this study in Table of Materials). The reference pattern should be visible in the peripheral region (for example, top well region), in which the reference pattern was generated (see Figure 4E).\nAdjust focus on the pattern edges through the camera path. Record the Z-position according to the best focus on the reference pattern. This adjusted Z-position will be the optimal laser focus used for subsequent patterning.\n5. Software set-up and photopatterning",
    "NOTE: Once the calibration of the system has been achieved (step 4), the user will upload the desired pattern templates (template configuration, Figure 5) for photopatterning, with the option to generate patterns for one or multiple proteins in each micro-well. The micro-patterning process involves photopatterning and protein incubation steps (see Figure 2).\nUnder sterile conditions, remove 18 µL of PBS from all the micro-wells and add 5 µL of PLPP to each micro-well. Ensure that PLPP is homogenous on the whole surface of the micro-wells.\nPosition the culture dish with the reference pattern micro-well (Figure 4D,E) above the objective and select Pattern now in the Leonardo software.\nVisualize the micro-well with transmitted light through the camera path and choose the ROI symbol. Set the diameter of the ROI to 4,000 µm and overlap the edge of the digital ROI to the edge of the current micro-well. Select Lock.\n\tNOTE: the shape and diameter of the ROI depends on the design and size of the PDMS stencil being used. For example, if using 5,000 x 5,000 µm PDMS squared stencils, use a 5,000 x 5,000 µm squared ROI.\nRepeat the overlapping step (step 5.3) for each micro-well of the dish. Upon completion, switch off the transmitted light.\nNavigate to the center of the reference pattern micro-well, away from the reference pattern region, and select PRIMO to upload the desired pattern template, which will be projected on the ROI as a design unit (see Figure 5). Patterns will appear in a dropdown list referred to as Actions and shown in the Actions menu on the software.\n\tNOTE: Pattern templates need to be designed ahead of the experiment and saved as an 8-bit Tiff file before loading the template in the software.",
    "In order to create a pattern across the whole micro-well, the design unit needs to be replicated. A design unit covers around 0.1 mm2 of the micro-well area. In the Replication menu, set the desired number of columns and rows (Lines in the software) (see Figure 5).\nTo generate a continuous pattern, adjust the spacing between columns and lines; in this study, patterns of continuous stripes are obtained using -20 to -35 µm spacing (negative spacing) between columns. This negative spacing creates an overlap among design units (Figure 5B,C).\nSet the laser dose in the Replication menu. The optimal laser dose in this setting and using PLL-PEG is 1390 mJ/mm2. The patterning duration will be displayed in the Estimated Time panel.\n\tNOTE: In this case laser power is 7.5 mW/mm2, taking approximately 30 s to pattern each design unit, using a dose of 1390 mJ/mm2. For example, a design unit (0.1 mm2) replicated in 4 columns and 4 lines (around 1.6 mm2), would take 8 min to be patterned. Higher laser doses may be required if the culture dish surface is passivated with PEG-SVA (approximately double laser dose compared to PLL-PEG).\nSelect Lock and wait until the pattern is virtually displayed.\nTo update the parameters of a pattern, click on the related Action, then unlock and update the parameters. Select Lock again when the pattern update is completed.\nThe patterning of multiple proteins in the same micro-well (sequential micro-patterning rounds) requires an accurate alignment of the patterns. To achieve such alignment, upload all sets of desired pattern templates simultaneously (patterns of first and second photopatterning rounds).",
    "Set the replication and dose parameters of the pattern templates. After parameters are set, patterns will appear as Actions in the Actions list. Save this template configuration as a file in software (see Figure 5D).\nOn the Actions list, select only the specific actions to be patterned during the first patterning round and deselect the actions that will be patterned during the second patterning round (see Figure 5D).\nNavigate to the area where the reference pattern was produced in step 4.2 (for example, top region of the reference pattern micro-well, see Figure 4E). Adjust the focus to the optimal Z-position (obtained in step 4.4).\n\tNOTE: It is strongly recommended to select perfect focus system on the microscope being used (if available), which ensures that the optimal Z-position for patterning will be maintained throughout the entire photopatterning process.\nSelect the Play symbol to start patterning. Patterning duration will be displayed in the Estimated Time panel. On Leonardo software version 4.4 patterning is completed when all Actions appear blue in the Visualization menu.\n6. Protein incubation\nNOTE: Micro-wells are incubated with ECM proteins (preferably fluorescently-labeled). These will only bind to the areas where PEG was cleaved through the photopatterning process described in step 5. Each well contains a PDMS stencil with 4 micro-wells, which will allow testing 4 different conditions simultaneously, for example, incubation of a different protein in each micro-well (see Figure 4D).\nUse fluorescently-labeled proteins (for example, laminin, fibronectin or fibrinogen conjugated to red or green fluorophores) in order to visualize the micro-patterns (see step 6.7 and 9.4). Alternatively, adsorbed unlabeled proteins can be visualized at later stages using immunofluorescence.",
    "NOTE: ECM proteins (for example, fibronectin) can be labeled using existing protocols33 and commercially available fluorescence labeling kits (i.e., Alexa 488 labeling kit), or purchased readily labeled (for example, conjugated fibrinogen-488 or laminin-red fluorescent rhodamine, see Table of Materials).\nUnder sterile conditions, prepare desired concentration of ECM proteins (10 µg/mL laminin, fibronectin or fibrinogen in PBS, see Table of Materials and step 4.3).\n\tNOTE: Fluorescently-labeled ECM proteins are light sensitive and should be protected from light (wrap dish in aluminum foil) and should be kept on ice at all times.\nUnder sterile conditions, wash the micro-wells three times with 20 µL of PBS to remove the PLPP.\nRemove 18 µL of PBS from all the micro-wells and add 20 µL of ECM protein solution to each micro-well. Incubate at room temperature, for 20-30 min and protect from light.\n\tNOTE: Optimal coating incubation times may vary depending on the type and concentration of proteins.\nAfter incubation, remove 15 µL of ECM protein solution and wash the micro-wells three times with 20 µL of PBS.\n\tNOTE: Always leave approximately 5 µL of PBS in between washes.\nIf patterning with only one protein (one round of micro-patterning), proceed either to storage of the culture dish (step 10) or to cell plating (step 11, and see Figure 2). If performing a second round of micro-patterning with a different protein in the same micro-well, proceed either to storage of the culture dish (step 10) or to blocking unspecific binding sites (step 7, and see Figure 2).\nOptional quality control step: visualize and image printed patterns using an epifluorescence microscope prior to plating cells. Select appropriate fluorescent channels and adjust exposure times accordingly.\n\tNOTE: To compare the fluorescence intensity of patterns between experiments, it is essential to use the same exposure times for the same proteins.",
    "7. Blocking unspecific binding sites (only for multiple protein patterns)\nNOTE: Micro-patterning with multiple proteins in the same micro-well involves sequential patterning steps (see Figure 2). A blocking agent (PLL-PEG or BSA) is added to the micro-wells to prevent cross-binding, which occurs when the second incubated protein (step 9) binds to the first incubated protein (step 6), thus avoiding a mixture of proteins within the patterns.\nUnder sterile conditions, add 20 µL of PLL-PEG (0.1 mg/mL in PBS) or BSA (1% BSA in PBS) as a blocking step to prevent cross-binding.\n\tNOTE: Blocking efficiency may vary depending on the nature of proteins being used and the affinity among them. It is recommended to test both PLL-PEG and BSA as blocking agents beforehand (Figure 10D-I).\nIncubate blocking agent at room temperature for 1 h and protect from light. Remove 15 µL of blocking agent and wash all micro-wells three times with 20 µL of PBS. Always leave approximately 5 µL of PBS in between washes.\nRemove 18 µL of PBS from all the micro-wells and add 5 µL of PLPP to each micro-well, ensuring that PLPP is homogenous on the whole surface of the micro-wells.\n8. Second round of photopatterning (only for multiple protein patterns)\nNOTE: After the first round of photopatterning and protein incubation, a micro-pattern is generated. During the second round of photopatterning, the pattern for the second protein will be generated in the same micro-well (see Figure 2C and Figure 5D). In the software, select the correct pattern templates (actions), which will be patterned during this round (see Figure 5D).\nNavigate to the first micro-well (Figure 4D). Ensure appropriate overlap between the digital ROI and the micro-well.",
    "Load the template configuration saved previously (step 5.12) and select the actions to be patterned during the second photopatterning round (deselect actions from first round, see Figure 5D).\nSelect the Play symbol to start patterning. Ensure the laser is on in the software.\n9. Second round of protein incubation (only for multiple protein patterns)\nNOTE: In this part of the protocol, fluorescently-labeled protein/s will be incubated on the culture dish after the second round of photopatterning.\nUnder sterile conditions, wash the micro-well three times with 20 µL of PBS to remove the PLPP. Remove 18 µL of PBS and add 20 µL of ECM protein solution to each micro-well. Incubate at room temperature for 20-30 min and protect from light.\n\tNOTE: Optimal coating incubation times may vary depending on the type and concentration of proteins.\nAfter incubation, remove 15 µL of ECM protein solution and wash the micro-wells three times with 20 µL of PBS. Always leave approximately 5 µL of PBS in between washes.\nEither proceed to storage of culture dish (step 10) or to cell plating (step 11, and see Figure 2).\nOptional quality control step: using an epifluorescence microscope, visualize and image printed patterns before plating cells. Select appropriate fluorescent channels and adjust exposure time.\n\tNOTE: To compare the fluorescence intensity of patterns between experiments, it is essential to use the same exposure times for the same proteins.\n10. Storage of micro-patterns\nNOTE: Micro-patterns with adsorbed proteins can be stored during different steps of the protocol (see Figure 2). If micro-patterning with multiple proteins, micro-patterns can be stored after the first round of micro-patterning or after the two sequential rounds of micro-patterning have been completed (see Figure 2B).",
    "When passivated with PLL-PEG, store the micro-patterns in PBS (3 mL per well) at 4 °C for up to 3 days.\nIf the culture dish was passivated with PEG-SVA, micro-patterns can be stored for up to 1 month. In order to do so, rinse micro-patterns intensively with double distilled deionized water and dry with a sterile air gun of argon or nitrogen, although normal air can also be used. After drying, micro-patterns can be stored at 4 °C for up to 1 month (PRIMO system support team, personal communication).\n11. Plating cells\nNOTE: During the next steps, cells will be plated on the prepared micro-patterned culture dish/es. In these studies, a neuronal cell line (CAD cells) is used31. However this protocol can be adjusted to study other cell types of interest (adjust cell plating protocol as required).\nDifferentiate CAD cells for 48 h using differentiation medium (DMEM supplemented with 1% Glutamine, without serum, and with 1% Pen/Strep, see Table of Materials).\nPlate 1 mL of medium with cells in the inner glass well, covering all micro-wells and place the culture dish in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator."
