    "The permission to collect human carotid atherosclerotic specimens in our biobank was approved by the local Hospital Ethics Committee (2799/10, Ethikkommission der Fakultät für Medizin der Technischen Universität München, Munich, Germany). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Experiments were performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.\n1. Tissue preparation\nPrepare 5–8 tissue sections of 10 µm from the FFPE sample with the microtome and transfer it in a 1.5 mL tube. It is not necessary to reduce the excess of paraffin from the block.\n\tNOTE: Thinner single sections instead of one large section accelerate the buffer reaction. Discard the first sections due to O2 exposure. For bigger samples, it is also possible to use fewer sections.\nCentrifuge these tubes in a bench top centrifuge, set to 5,000 x g for 1 min at room temperature to collect each sample on the bottom of the tube.\n\tCAUTION: Too long centrifugation leads to clotting of the sample and complicates the lysis.\n2. Lipid dissolution and deparaffinization\nNOTE:This step is needed for deparaffinization and lipid digestion. The buffer used is less toxic than commercial deparaffinization solutions.\nAdd 300 µL of the commercially available incubation buffer and 6 µL of 1-thioglycerol to each tube.\n\tNOTE: Do not use more than 300 µL as this is the maximum volume of the automation system cartridge.\nVortex for 10 s and incubate the sample for 10 min at 80 °C and 500 rpm in a heating block to solubilize paraffin.\n\tCAUTION: The tissue should be completely dissolved in the end. If necessary, vortex several times during incubation.\n3. Sample and protein digestion",
    "NOTE:Native digestion with protease K is crucial to have clean DNA extracts without proteins. It also reduces any contaminating proteins present. Furthermore, nucleases are also destroyed to save the DNA34. This overnight step is also needed for complete sample digestion.\nLet the sample cool down to 60 °C and then add 30 µL of the provided Proteinase K solution.\nVortex again and incubate the mixture at 65 °C and 500 rpm overnight (4–20 h) in a heating block. Vortex the samples during incubation from time to time for complete sample digestion.\n\tNOTE: Overnight incubation leads to better results. Mixing steps are recommended every 30–60 min. In the end, there should not be any visual tissue piece inside the tube.\n4. Cell lysis\nAdd 400 µL of the lysis buffer, provided in the blood kit and vortex shortly.\nIncubate the sample again at 65 °C for 30 min with 500 rpm.\nLet the sample cool down to room temperature. The paraffin will harden on top.\n\tCAUTION: Do not vortex again, to keep the paraffin separated from the sample. Otherwise, the paraffin is mixed with the tissue, which destroys the sample. The sample will be collected in step 6.1.\n5. Preparation of the pre-dispensed cartridges\nTurn on the machine, as well as the associated tablet computer.\nStart the software app and click on the Door button to open the instrument.\nRemove the rack from the instrument and insert the pre-filled cartridge into the probe rack. Ensure that the cartridge clicks twice when into place and remove the sealing foil.\nAdd the plunger in the last (8) well of the cartridge. It serves as pipette tip in the instrument.",
    "Fill the provided 0.5 mL elution tubes with 65 µL of elution buffer, provided with the kit. Leave the tubes open and insert them into the dedicated position in the front part of the rack, after the cartridge.\n\tNOTE: The minimum volume for elution is 60 µL. The system will lose 5–10 µL of the added elution volume.\n6. Automated DNA extraction\nCarefully puncture the paraffin on top of the 1.5 mL tube from step 4.3 to reach to the clean sample at the bottom of the tube without mixing it with paraffin again.\nTransfer the whole mixture (730 µL) of the prepared sample in the first well of the cartridge.\nInsert the rack into the automated DNA extraction machine. Ensure that the rack locks in the back of the machine first and in the front afterwards.\nStart the run by clicking the upper left orange Start button in the software. A window with different pre-installed protocols will open. Select Blood DNA protocol on the instrument. Confirm that plunger, elution tube, and sample were added by clicking yes in the software. The door of the instrument will close automatically, and the run starts (the light will turn green). The run will take approximately 38 min. No further calibration is needed.\n\tNOTE: Watch until the system has picked up the plungers for all samples in the rack. If this is not happening the system stops automatically and the machine protocol must be restarted.\nEnsure that the system performs the automated lysis step in the first well of the cartridge, followed by washing steps in wells 3 to 7. There is no further programming step needed. The complete program is pre-installed by the company.",
    "Once done, ensure that the system elutes the DNA in the prepared elution tubes via the added plunger. The magnetic particles stay in the plunger. The plunger in the end goes back to the last well of the cartridge.\n7. Finish the run\nWhen the run is completed (the machine shows green blinking light), open the instrument by clicking the button for opening (door-sign) and remove the rack from the system.\nDiscard the cartridges.\nReinsert the empty rack to the instrument and close the door via the door button in the upper-right corner. Close the software app and turn off the machine, as well as the tablet computer.\nStore eluates at -20 °C for long-term storage or at 4 °C for short-term storage or use it directly for downstream analysis or concentration measurements.\nSubscription Required.
