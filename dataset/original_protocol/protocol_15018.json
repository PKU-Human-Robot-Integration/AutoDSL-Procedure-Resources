    "The protocol follows the Hadassah Hebrew University Ethics Committee guidelines for studies in human subjects. To avoid the effect of myopia or refractive errors on test results, the protocols should be performed while patients wear their eyeglasses (corrected vision).\nObject From Motion (OFM) protocol:\n1. Test Initiation and Instructing Subjects\nSeat the subject 50 cm in front of the computer screen.\nOpen the OFM software.\nInstruct the subject that he will be presented with motion defined objects. Instruct him to respond as correct and as fast as possible by pressing the \"A\" keyboard and then verbally naming the perceived object.\nFollowing response, a screen indicating \"press the space bar\" will appear. Instruct the subject to press the space bar when ready to identify the next stimulus.\nExplain to the subject that stimuli may appear at very hard to-perceive velocities or at some easier to perceive ones.\n2. Learning Phase\nEnter \"learning OFM\" at the command line. Subject will now be presented with 4 example stimuli. This phase is conducted when subject's both eyes are open.\n3. Testing Phase",
    "In general, each OFM test includes 20 stimuli. All are first presented at the lowest velocity of 4 pixels/sec. Those not recognized will be then presented at the next velocity of 5.5 pixels/sec. Those not recognized, will be then presented at the next velocity of 7.5 pixels/sec and so on, going through 10 pixels/sec, 13.5 pixels/sec, 18 pixels/sec, and till the fastest velocity of 24.5 pixels/sec. Velocities were defined based on the exponent y=3*e0.3. If five consecutive stimuli in a certain velocity were not recognized, the next stimuli will be presented at the next faster velocity to avoid frustration in the patients. This will result in shortening test length which generally is longer as recognition is worse (necessitating the passage through larger number of velocities per stimulus).\nCover subject's one eye with an eye patch. Every eye patch may be adequate as long as it supplies full coverage.\nEnter \"OFM objects\" at the command line.\nChoose one stimuli set (software includes 4 stimuli sets. Each set includes 20 different objects. Selection may be random. However, make sure that you apply different stimuli sets for each of the tested eyes; Apply different stimuli sets for subsequent learning time points in case of longitudinal assessment).\nA prompt asking you to enter subject's name, tested eye and testing date will appear. Complete required information.\nCarefully monitor the subject and respond to the subject while she/he completes the task as follows:\n\t\nWhen a stimulus appears the subject must press the \"A\" button on the keyboard and name the identity of the presented stimulus.\nPress the left mouse button for a correct answer or the right mouse button for a wrong answer.\nSubject presses the \"space bar\" on the keyboard for initiation of the next stimulus.",
    "This procedure (steps 3.5.1-3.1.5.3) continues until all 20 stimuli in the set are either recognized or presented at the fastest velocity.\nRepeat the whole procedure (from step 3.1) for the subject's second eye using a different set of stimuli.\nTime-constrained Stereo Protocol:\n1. Test Initiation and Instructing Subjects\nSeat the subject 50 cm in front of the computer screen.\nOpen the Stereo software.\nInstruct the subject that he will be presented with 3 dimensional (3D) shapes and will have to name the perceived shape as correct and fast as possible. Shapes will be one of the following: a circle, a square, a triangle, or a star.\nExplain to the subject that stimuli may appear at very hard to perceive conditions or at some easier to perceive ones.\nInstruct the subject to wear the 3D glasses.\nTurn off the room lightening.\n2. Learning Phase\nEnter \"learning Stereo\" at the command line. Subject will be now presented with 4 repetitions of each shape, presented at the longest stimuli duration (500 msec) and at the easiest disparity (840 sec of arc) conditions. Following the 3D presentation condition, a 2D presentation will follow for each shape. In the latter, a line marking shapes contours will be added, to make sure subject perceived the dimensions of the presented shape. Subjects, who did not succeed at this easy condition, will not be tested at the next phase.\n3. Testing Phase: Stereopsis Perception as a Function of Binocular Disparity\nThe 4 shapes will be presented for 500 msec at 4 different disparity conditions: 120, 300, 540, and 840 sec of arc.\nEnter \"Stereo Disparity\" at the command line.\nA prompt asking you to enter subject's name and testing date will appear. Complete required information.\nStimulus appears",
    "Subject names the presented shape. Responses are coded by the examiner at key buttons 1-4 (i.e. press the 1, 2, 3, or 4 key buttons for subject's verbal responses of \"a circle\", \"a square\", \"a triangle\", or \"a star\", respectively). Due to lighting conditions and the fact that the subject wears 3D glasses, he cannot code the responses by himself).\nSubject presses any key to continue to the next stimulus. The order of stimuli presentation is random.\n4. Testing Phase\nStereopsis perception as a function of stimulus presentation time. The 4 shapes will be presented for disparities of 540 and 840 sec of arc at either 40, 60, or 100 msec durations.\nEnter \"Stereo Duration\" at the command line.\nRepeat steps 3.2-3.5.\nSubscription Required.
