  "procedures": [
    "1. Creation of pNIPAAM-coated Plates\nDissolve the 2.6 g of pNIPAAM in 2 ml of a 60% toluene/40% hexane solution.\nHeat the mixture to 60 °C for 10 min stirred, until the pNIPAAM is dissolved.\nCut filter paper into a 60 mm diameter circle and place paper in the Buchner funnel.\nFilter the solution through Buchner Funnel into the pre-weighed glass beaker (do not use plastics, as hexane will melt plastics).\nPlace the beaker and contents into a bell vacuum (24 psi) O/N (16 hr). Note: Until the residue is reacted with isopropyl it will oxidize so make sure it does not come into contact with oxygen.\nWeigh the beaker to establish the weight of the pNIPAAM.\nAdd isopropyl alcohol to the pNIPAAM, creating a 50/50 w/w solution.\nPlace 2 ml of the solution on the surface of the tissue culture plate, and coat for 5 min under UV light.\nWash the plate with 2 ml of warm PBS twice before using for cell culture.\n2. Creation of Cell Sheets\nNote: Cell sheets of primary cells for the target organ can be created using a number of different methods, or by coating tissue culture surfaces with thermo-responsive polymer as described here. Pre-coated thermo-sensitive plates are also offered by a number of vendors.\nNote: This protocol is for culture using a 35 mm dish. Briefly, cells are first incubated at 37 °C for a minimum of 24 hr at confluence to establish lateral connections between adjacent cells. To release cell sheets, plates are subjected to temperatures below 32 °C. The cell sheet is then transferred to the strong base fibrous matrix containing a neovascular permissive hydrogel with vascular endothelial cells.",
    "Isolate the cell population. Note: This method is dependent on the individual derivation procedures and the type of cells. Rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC) are used in this example. These are primary smooth muscle cells isolated from the abdominal aorta of a rat.\nWash the cells with 2 ml of warm PBS.\nAdd 3 ml of trypsin (or other cleaving/disassociating solution) to the cells for 5 min.\nInhibit the trypsin by the addition of 3 ml of the culture media, or phosphate buffer solution (PBS) containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS).\nCollect the cells in a conical tube and count an aliquot.\nSpin the cells at 1,000 rpm (228 x g) for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in their growth media (SmGM2 plus bullet kit culture medium is used for RASMC).\nPlace the media containing the cells on a 35 mm thermo-sensitive plate – pNIPAAM coated plate at a concentration that will achieve 100% confluence. Note: For RASMCs that number was determined to be 100,000 cells/cm2. However, due to loss of cells during the passing, 120% of that value is used.\nPlace into an incubator at 37 °C O/N. Note: It is important to maintain the cells at 37 °C to maintain the cell adhesion to the plate.\n3. Preparation of Foundational Matrix\nNote: Various 3D fibrous matrices can be used to layer strong fibrous matrix between the delicate cell sheets. Some examples include: gelfoam, bioglass, natural acellularized materials26 or nanospun materials27,28 The porcine urinary bladder matrix (UBM) used in these studies was generously provided from our collaborator, Dr Badylak.29\nPrior to use, determine matrix characteristics including the lack of cellular content if decellularized matrix is used,27,28 cell specific viability, and void space.22",
    "Cut the pre-sterilized matrix into a desired size and shape. Note: Here, a hole-punch is used to cut a 4 mm diameter circle.\n4. Seeding Endothelial Cells into a Neovascular Permissive Hydrogel\nNote: Endothelial cells can be obtained from a variety of sources, including differentiation from stem or progenitor cells. Here, HuVECs are used.\nUse any permissive hydrogel (fibrin, collagen gels) as long as the cross-linking time is short enough to allow the cells stay viable. Note: Here, a Hyaluronan (HA) based gel cross-linked with a disulfide bridge is used.\nPrepare the HA hydrogel in accordance with the company protocol.\nCollect the endothelial cells and disperse into a single cell solution using 1x trypsin. Note: Accutase or Cell Dissociation Buffer could also be used for single cell dispersion.\nDeactivate the trypsin enzyme by using an equal amount of soybean trypsin inhibitor (if it is important that cells do not come into contact with serum) or 10% FBS in PBS, collecting the solution/cells into a 15 ml conical tube.\nCount the cells, and calculate the volume needed for the patch dimensions (previously quantified). Note: For a 4 mm patch, here 2 million endothelial cells are used.\nExtract 2 million cells, and place into a new 15 ml conical tube.\nSpin at (228 x g) for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant, leaving the cells as a pellet in a conical tube.\nMix the HA and Gelatin liquid materials in a 1:1 ration. Then add 80% of the total volume into the conical tube containing the pellet.\nResuspend the endothelial cells in the 1:1 HA /Gelatin mixture\nPlace the suspended cells in the HA /Gelatin mixture into the base fibrous matrix from Step 2.\nAdd 1/5 (20 percent) of the total volume desired of the cross-linker\nIncubate for 1 hr at 37 °C.",
    "5. Isolation of Cell Sheets\nRemove the 35 mm pNIPAAM-treated plates containing the cells from the incubator and place in a cell culture hood at RT.\nQuickly aspirate the media from the cells, and add 2 ml of 6% normal gelatin that has been heated to 37 °C.\nWhile the gelatin is still warm, place the metal lattice into the gelatin, submerging it below the surface of the normal gelatin (Movie 1).\nPlace the entire plate onto ice for 5 to 7 min, allowing the gelatin to harden.\nAfter 7 min, use a spatula to carefully separate the gelatin edges from the side of the plate, and then use forceps to lift the metal lattice from the plate Note: The 6% gelatin, and the cell sheet should lift with the lattice.\nMove the cell sheet to the dish and place on top of the base fibrous matrix-hydrogel combination, carefully setting the lattice on top of the construct. Note: The apical side of the cell sheet will still be in the top position.\nAdd 2 ml of warm media (37 °C).\nIncubate O/N allowing the sheet of cells to adhere to the hydrogel surface.\nRemove the metal lattice after the solution warms (approximately 1 hr), or the next day.\nSubscription Required.
