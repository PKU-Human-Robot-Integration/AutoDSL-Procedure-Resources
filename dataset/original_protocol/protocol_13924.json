    "This procedure was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at Taipei Medical University.\nNOTE: Human MSCs stably transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and firefly luciferase genes (Fluc) were obtained from a commercial company (Table of Materials).\n1. Characterization of human MSCs with firefly luciferase and green fluorescent protein\nMaintain human MSCs transfected with GFP and Fluc in complete media (minimum essential medium eagle-alpha modification [αMEM], supplemented with 10−15% fetal bovine serum [FBS], 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 ng/mL basic FGF, and PSF) at 37 °C with saturated humidity and 5% CO2. Passage cells at ~70−90% confluence.\nObserve MSCs under a fluorescence phase contrast microscope (Figure 1A) and analyze the expression levels of Fluc and GFP14.\nCharacterize the MSCs by analyzing the expression of CD markers including CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105 using flow cytometry (Figure 1B). Induce trilineage differentiation of stem cells to adipocytes, chondrocytes, and osteocytes, and confirm trilineage differentiation (Figure 1C) by von Kossa, oil red O, and Alcian blue staining following a commercial protocol15,16.\n2. Anesthetization of rat pups\nAllow time-dated pregnant Sprague–Dawley rats to deliver vaginally at term.\nRemove the rat pups from the cage on postnatal day 5.\nAnesthetize the rat pups using gas anesthesia (i.e., 2% isoflurane) in an anesthesia chamber.\nConfirm adequate anesthesia by checking breathing and reflexes.\n\tNOTE: Breathing should become shallow and reflexes should diminish. Rat pups remain unconscious for at least ~10 min with this isoflurane concentration.\n3. Intratracheal instillation\nOnce anesthetized, restrain the rat pups on an intubation stand angled at ~60° and hold pups in place with laboratory labeling tape on all four limbs.\nApply tape below the nose to fix the head and pinpoint the neck for puncture tracheotomy.\nDisinfect the incision area (i.e., neck) with a 75% alcohol prep pad.",
    "Make a 0.3 cm vertical midline neck incision above the trachea with microscissors to avoid damaging the carotid arteries.\nDissect the fat and muscle layers away to locate the trachea with curved tip tapered tweezers without a hook.\nHold the trachea with the curved tip tapered tweezers.\nHold a 100 μL syringe upright and slowly inject 30 μL of normal saline (i.e., control) or 30 μL of Fluc-GFP labeled MSCs (1 x 105 cells) into the trachea through a 30 G needle syringe during inspiratory phase.\nClose the incision with one 6-0 silk stitch, tie the knot as small as possible, and cut the ends as short as possible.\nPlace the rats under infrared light or on a heating pad to keep warm and allow them to recover from anesthesia.\nConfirm the rats are warm, pink, and capable of spontaneous movement before returning the rats to the cage.\n4. Monitoring the pulmonary distribution of MSCs\nTo track the transplanted human MSCs, intraperitoneally inject the rats with luciferin potassium salt in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at a dose of 125 mg/kg of body weight 15 min after MSC injection.\nAnesthetize the rats using 2% isoflurane through nose cones.\nAcquire sequential images at 5–15 s intervals 10 min after luciferin administration with medium binning, 1 f/stop, and a 26 cm field of view using a small-animal imaging system (Table of Materials).\nQuantify the luminescence activity from the lungs based on the automatic regions of interest using imaging software (Table of Materials)17.\nSubscription Required.
