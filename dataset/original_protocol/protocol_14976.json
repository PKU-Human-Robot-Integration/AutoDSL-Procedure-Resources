    "Ethics Statement\nThis study was carried out in strict accordance with European and National Law for the Care and Use of Animals. The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments and the Protection of Animals in the State of Thuringia, Germany (Permit Number: 04-004/11). All experiments were performed under supervision of the authorized institutional Agent for Animal Protection. Bronchoscopy was strictly performed under general anesthesia. During the study, every effort was made to minimize discomfort or suffering.\nGeneral remarks\nThe described techniques have been developed for calves of approximately 6-8 weeks of age, weighing about 60-80 kg. For the use in other large animal species or calves different in age and bodyweight, the techniques must be adapted to fit the size and weight and take into account the lung anatomy of the particular animal species. All equipment used must be sterile. Chlamydia psittaci is a zoonotic bacterium which can cause respiratory and general disease in humans. The non-avian C. psittaci strain DC15 used in the present protocol must be handled under biosafety level 2. All work with the pathogen and with infected animals must be performed wearing personal protective equipment, such as a respirator, a splash water proof jumpsuit, rubber boots and gloves. Wearing a suitable respirator is of great importance, since the natural route of infection for C. psittaci is aerogen. Packaging and labeling of samples must be disinfectant proof since all things must be treated with a disinfectant effective against chlamydiae according to the manufacturer’s instructions before leaving the animal housing unit.\n1. Preparing the Animal for Bronchoscopy\nDetermine the weight of the calf for dosage of anesthetics.\nPlace an intravenous (IV) access in the left jugular vein.",
    "First, slowly inject xylazine (0.2 mg/kg bodyweight) over approximately 30 sec, then, after sedation occurs, inject ketamine (2.0 mg/kg bodyweight). \nLift the animal onto the table and place it in right lateral recumbency. Once the animal is adequately positioned on the table, check if the IV access is still in place and readjust it if necessary. During anesthesia, regularly check the eyelid reflex to determine the depth of anesthesia.\nOnce the animal is breathing steadily, have someone pull the tongue out and stretch the neck. Place a metal tube speculum in the animal’s mouth, using slight rotating movements. Push the speculum forward under sight control, using a flashlight, until the larynx is visible.\nMaintain anesthesia throughout the whole endoscopic procedure by injecting a bolus of 7 mg xylazine and 70 mg ketamine as needed.\n2. Inoculation (Inoculation Sites: Figure 1)\nPrepare 3 syringes with inoculum, containing 1, 2, and 5 ml of the inoculum.\nInsert a Teflon tube into the endoscope’s working channel. The tube should not protrude from the endoscope’s tip.\nInsert the endoscope through the metal speculum. Slight readjustments of the speculum might be necessary to enable the passing of the larynx. The Bronchus trachealis, which branches off to the right side, helps to align the picture on the monitor.",
    "Attach the syringe with 5 ml inoculum to the end of the Teflon tube. Navigate the tube into the branches where the inoculum shall be deposited and apply the desired amount (Right lung: Lobus medius: 0.5 ml, Lobus accessorius: 0.5 ml, Lobus caudalis: 0.5 ml and 1.0 ml; Left lung: Lobus cranialis, Pars cranialis: 0.5 ml, Pars caudalis: 0.5 ml, Lobus caudalis: 1.5 ml). Attach the syringe with 1 ml inoculum to the tube, then navigate to the Bronchus trachealis and deposit the inoculum (Lobus cranialis, Pars caudalis: 1.0 ml). It is helpful to always approach the localizations in the same order.\nRemove the endoscope and the speculum.\nSpray 1 ml of the inoculum into each nostril with an actuator.\nBring the animal back to the stable and place it in prone position for waking up. Do not leave the animal unattended or in the company of other animals until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. The recovery stable should be air-conditioned, since the animal’s ability for thermoregulation is decreased under general anesthesia.\n\tNOTE: First clinical signs should occur about 24-36 hr after inoculation, depending on the pathogen used.\n3. Sampling Procedures (Sampling Sites: Figure 2)\nPrepare the animal as described in steps 1.1-1.6.\nBronchoalveolar lavage\n\t\nPlace 5 syringes each containing 20 ml of sterile isotonic saline, in a water-bath and allow them to warm up to approximately 38 °C.\nInsert a lavage catheter into the endoscope’s working channel, then insert the endoscope into the metal speculum and navigate forward into the main bronchus of the left lung until the “wedge position” is reached where the endoscope cannot be pushed any further ahead.",
    "One after another, attach the syringes with the warm NaCl solution to the lavage catheter, instill the fluid and aspirate it directly. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid must be stored in siliconized glass bottles and put on ice immediately after recovery to prevent the alveolar macrophages from attaching to the glass surface. Note both the amount of instilled saline and the amount of recovered fluid.\nRemove the lavage catheter from the working channel.\nBronchial brushing\n\t\nNavigate the endoscope to the desired sampling location, in the described protocol this is the Bifurcatio tracheae.\nCover the brush with the tube before inserting it into the endoscope’s working channel until the brush’s tip appears on the monitor.\nPush the brush with the plastic tube forward about 5 cm and uncover it from the plastic tube by pushing the handle, then navigate it to the location that is to be brushed.\nRub off epithelial calls by gently pushing and pulling the brush back and forth while navigating the endoscope to ensure contact between the brush and the wall of the bronchus. Stop rubbing when bleeding occurs. Cover the brush with the tube before pulling it out of the working channel.\nPrepare up to five smears on microscope slides by gently rolling the brush over the slide. Fixate the smears in cold methanol for 10 min, air dry and store at -20 °C.\nThe brush can be rinsed in various media, depending on the purpose of the sampled cells. If taking multiple brushings with the same brush, be sure to only rinse it in media which do not irritate the mucous membrane.\nTransbronchial lung biopsy",
    "Navigate the endoscope to the desired sampling location, in the described protocol this is the Pars caudalis of the Lobus cranialis. Before inserting the biopsy forceps into the working channel open and close it a couple of times to ensure that it is working smoothly.\nPush the biopsy forceps into the caudal branch of the Bronchus trachealis until a slight resistance occurs. Pull back 2-3 cm, open the forceps, push forward about 2 cm, close the forceps, pull back and remove the forceps from the working channel. This requires some practice.\nCarefully remove the tissue from the biopsy forceps, using a needle or small forceps. Depending on the further use of the tissue, store it in liquid nitrogen or a suitable fixation medium. This should happen right after removal to prevent autolytic processes.\nPost-procedural treatment\n\t\nBring the animal back to the stable and place it in prone position for waking up. Do not leave the animal unattended or in the company of other animals until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. The recovery stable should be air-conditioned, since the animal’s ability for thermoregulation is decreased under general anesthesia.\nMonitor the animal closely for signs of pneumothorax for the next 24 hr. Provide feed and fresh water when the animal has regained full consciousness."
