    "1. Sample Preparation\nBuffer exchange human FVIII-BDD14 and porcine FVIII-BDD15 against HBS-Ca buffer (20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, pH = 7.4) and concentrate to 1.2 mg/ml. Keep the protein solution at -80 °C.\nPrepare lipid nanotubes (LNT) by mixing GalactosylCeramide (GC) and phosphatidylserine (PS) at 1:4 w/w ratio in chloroform. Evaporate the chloroform under argon and solubilize the lipids in HBS buffer to 1 mg/ml. Keep the LNT solution at 4 °C.\n2. Cryo-electron Microscopy of FVIII-LNT\nCryo-EM Sample Preparation\n\t\nGlow discharge the 300 mesh Quantifoil R2/2 copper grids (carbon side up) in a mixture of O2 and H2 gas for 10 sec at 50 W.\nMix the FVIII and LNT solutions in HBS-Ca buffer at 1:1 w/w ratio and incubate for 15 min at room temperature.\nApply a drop of 2.5 µl of FVIII-LNT sample to the hydrophilic electron microscopy grid in the Vitrobot Mark IV humidified chamber (100% humidity).\nBlot and flash freeze the grid (one blot for 3.5 sec, blot force 1) in liquid C2H6, cooled down by liquid N2 to obtain amorphous ice.\nStore grids in storage boxes under liquid N2 (LN2).\nCryo-EM Data Collection",
    "NOTE: The JEM2100-LaB6 (year 2010) is equipped with a TEMCON operating system consisting of a computer connected to the electron microscope, a screen with windows reading the vacuum system, illumination system, HT, lens currents and so-on, and two panels: LEFT and RIGHT, placed on both side of the column. The beam shift X,Y knobs (SHIFT Y, SIFT Y) and the multifunction (DEF/STIG) knobs are on both panels. On the LEFT panel is the illumination (BRIGTHNESS) knob. On the RIGHT panel are: the magnification (MAG/CAM LENGTH) and focus (FOCUS) knobs and the three imaging (MAG1, MAG2, LOWMAG) and a diffraction (DIFF) modes buttons. We acquire our data in MAG1 at alpha 2. The minimum dose illumination conditions (MDS) required for Cryo-EM data acquisition are set with F1 through F6 buttons, top row on RIGHT panel. In this protocol the generic settings are used: F1 - raise/lower screen, F2 - SEARCH mode, F3 – FOCUS mode, F4 – PHOTO mode, F5 – MDS OFF/ON and F6 – BEAM BLANK, used to shield the specimen from radiation damage by deflecting the beam.\n\t\nPlace the cryo-holder into the cryo-station and fill the Dewar of the holder and the cryo-station with LN2. When temperature reaches -192 °C, open shutter on the holder tip, place previously frozen Cryo-EM grid into the designated place and secure with a ring clamp.\nInsert the cryo-holder into the electron microscope. Refill the Dewar of the cryo-holder and the anti-contaminator chamber with LN2. Wait for the holder to stabilize for 30-60 min. Press F6 on and turn the filament on. When the filament is saturated, press F6 off and open shutter on holder to view the grid.\nPress Low Mag/alpha 1 (set at 200X mag) and locate areas with thin ice on the grid.",
    "Switch to MAG 1/alpha 2 to set minimum dose (MDS) mode and acquire Cryo-EM data at low electron doses, without damaging the specimen.\n\t\t\nPress F2 to set search mode. Set magnification at 40,000x. Enlarge beam with BRIGTNESS knob to minimal electron dose ~ 0.04 e-/Å2·s. Press DIFF to switch to diffraction mode. Set camera length to 120 cm with MAG/CAM LENGHT knob. Locate areas on the grid within the pre-selected areas in LOWMAG that have lipid nanotubes in the holes of the carbon film.\nPress F4 to set Photo mode at 40,000X magnification and set illumination with BRIGHTNESS knob at doses of 16-25 e-/Å2·s. Press Standard Focus button to set focus conditions adjusting the Z-height of the specimen with the Z UP/DOWN buttons (RIGHT control panel). Set defocus between -1.5 and -2.5 µm.\nAlign SEARCH and PHOTO mode by drawing a square in the LIVE VIEW window on the digital camera monitor in SEARCH mode corresponding to the area to be imaged in PHOTO mode.\nPress F3 to set Focus mode at 100,000X magnification. Focus illumination to cover the CCD chip (~4 - 5 cm radius) and off axis to not irradiate the area to be imaged in PHOTO mode. Adjust defocus to ~ -1.5 and -2.5 µm with the FOCUS knob and correct for astigmatism of the image with DEF/STIG knobs.\nSelect the FVIII-LNT to be imaged in SEARCH mode by acquiring live images in the LIVE VIEW window on the digital camera monitor. Center the FVIII-LNT in the square drawn on the LIVE VIEW window.",
    "Record a digital image on the CCD camera at 52,000X effective magnification and 0.5 sec exposure by switching to Photo mode and clicking the ACQUIRE button on the digital micrograph camera monitor. The image acquisition conditions are set such as the beam blank (SHUTTERS) open only when the image is acquired in PHOTO mode.\nCheck the quality and defocus of the acquired image by pressing CTRL-F to obtain a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).\n3. 3D Reconstruction\nNOTE: The image analysis software used for the 2D and 3D analysis: EMAN2 and IHRSR are freely available. EMAN2 can be downloaded from http://blake.bcm.edu/emanwiki/EMAN2/Install. The IHRSR software can be obtained from Professor Egelman: egelman@virginia.edu. The final IHRSR refinements are run on the Texas advanced computing center cluster: http://www.tacc.utexas.edu/ at the University of Texas, Austin. The 3D reconstruction algorithm shown on Figure 1 consists of two main steps: First selecting a homogenous set of helical segments (particles) with the 2D reference free alignment (RFA) algorithms implemented in EMAN 2, second achieving a 3D reconstruction based on the helical parameters and back projection algorithms incorporated in IHRSR. The first step utilizes the programs developed for selecting homogenous particle sets for 3D reconstruction with Single Particle SPA (algorithms) for which EMAN2 has been specifically developed and distributed: http://blake.bcm.edu/emanwiki/EMAN2. This step has been adapted to the Cryo-EM data. The second step is achieved with the IHRSR algorithm, which is specifically designed for the type of helical assemblies obtained with the recombinant Factor VIII forms. This algorithm has been documented extensively through the scientific literature12.\nPerform 2D image analysis with the EMAN2 scientific image-processing suite: http://blake.bcm.edu/eman2/doxygen_html16 to select homogenous particle (helical segment) sets for helical reconstruction.\n\t\nSelect Cryo-EM micrographs with straight and well-organized helical tubes with the digital camera software and visualization tools.",
