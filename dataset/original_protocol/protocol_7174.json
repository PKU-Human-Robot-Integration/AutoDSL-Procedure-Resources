    "General Considerations:  All cell culture, media preparation, tissue culture vessels, and other laboratory work is to be conducted inside a Class 2 microbiological hood, using aseptic technique.The hood should be cleaned thoroughly before use with 3% of Distel (or equivalent disinfectant) and 70% ethanol.Prepare all media, solutions, and reagents at room temperature (RT). See the Recipes section for more detailed information on media preparation.Human induced Pluripotent Stem cell culture and expansionPrepare all cell maintenance base media and reagents, as described in the Materials and Reagents or Recipes sections.Prepare vitronectin plates. Vitronectin is a glycoprotein used to coat the surface of cell culture plates, to facilitate hiPSC attachment and spreading. Thaw one 60 μL aliquot to RT and dilute into 6 mL DPBS without Ca2+/Mg2+. If using a 6-well plate, add 1–1.5 mL per well; alternatively, add 6 mL to one 10 cm dish. Ensure the vitronectin covers the entire surface, and incubate in a hood for 1–2 h at RT. Vitronectin plates can be sealed with ParafilmTM and stored at 4°C for 5 days. Allow to warm to RT for 1–2 h prior to use.Prepare the E8 basal medium by adding the thawed supplement and allowing the media to warm to RT. We recommend that thawed hiPSCs are cultured and expanded in E8 basal media, and that a master stock of hiPSC lines is frozen and stored early on.Set up a 15 mL Falcon with 9 mL of E8 media plus 0.312 µM ROCKi for one frozen vial of 1 mL of hiPSC, i.e., 1 µL of ROCKi into a final volume to 10 mL. Although ROCKi allows attachment and recovery of hiPSC, whilst preventing apoptosis & spontaneous differentiation, it must be removed from the media after 24 h, to prevent interference with colony expansion.",
    "Partially thaw the frozen hiPSCs quickly until just defrosted, with some ice remaining in the vial, using the water bath at 37°C (thawing should be quick, to avoid prolonged contact with DMSO; however, do not warm the entire vial to 37°C). Add 1 mL of E8 in a drop-wise fashion to the vial and gently transfer the cells to the 15 mL Falcon, using a wide-bore pipette tip or stripette. Invert the tube to mix and dilute out the DMSO.Note: The exact cell number or density in a cryovial is usually not known nor determined at the time of freezing, to avoid creating a single cell suspension, and to improve recovery after thawing for subsequent culture. Between 6–10 cryovials are generated from one previously 70–80% confluent 10 cm plate of hiPSCs. Spin at 290 × g and 20°C for 3 min. Discard the supernatant.Aspirate the diluted vitronectin from the plate surface. One thawed cryovial should give a small 5–20 µL cell pellet in a 15 mL Falcon after centrifugation. Resuspend the pellet gently in the desired volume of E8 medium supplemented with 3.12 µM ROCKi (1 µL: 1,000 µL), avoiding excessive pipetting.Note: ROCKi has been previously used in earlier adapted protocols at 10 µM, but we have titrated this down further, and have seen effective hiPSC attachment and recovery at a lower concentration of 3.12 µM. Plate 2 mL of cell suspension per well of a 6-well plate or 8 mL per 10 cm dish; aim to use minimum volumes of media to enhance adherence.",
    "One frozen vial of hiPSC (equivalent to 1 well of a 6-well plate, or one-tenth of a 10 cm dish at 70–80% confluence), can be split into 2–3 wells of a 6-well plate or if the hiPSC line demonstrates good recovery, then cells can be seeded less densely straight into a 10 cm dish. Recovery is described as good when multiple small colonies have attached to the vitronectin plate 24 h after seeding (see Figure 1), and colony expansion occurs in the following days (see Figure 2).Place the plate into a humidified 37°C incubator with 5% CO2. Ensure the plate is initially gently agitated to distribute the colonies evenly over the vitronectin.Check for attachment under a phase-contrast microscope after 24 h (see Figure 1).Change the medium every 24 h, remove the unattached colonies, dead cells, and spent media with a stripette or aspirator. If there are a lot of dead cells or debris, then wash the plate with DBPS before replacing the E8 media. Replace with fresh E8 basal media gently, using a stripette against the side wall of the vessel (ROCKi supplementation is not required after the first 24 h). hiPSCs are difficult to maintain in culture and are prone to differentiation, media cytokines, and factors that maintain pluripotency, necessitating daily media change.Continue to change media daily until the cells reach 70–80% confluency and ready for passaging. Do not allow the clusters/colonies to fuse together (see Figures 3, 4, and 5), which helps to avoid spontaneous differentiation. Once thawed hiPSCs are established, subsequent steps, culture systems, and further differentiation should take place after 1–2 passages.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4361/bioprotoc-12-06-4361-g001.jpgFigure 1.

Images obtained with a Olympus CKX41 Inverted Microscope, equipped with a 20× objective. Passaging and freezing of hiPSCPrepare vitronectin plates as before.Remove the exhausted media from the plate with hiPSC at 70–80% confluency and wash the plate/wells twice with DPBS without Ca2+/Mg2+ (approximately 6 mL for 10 cm dish).Remove the DPBS and add 6 mL of 0.5 mM PBS-EDTA solution, allowing full coverage of the plate surface.Observe the cells under a phase-contrast microscope every 2 min for up to 4 min, to monitor cell morphology changes and detachment (bright halos and edge enhancement to the colonies) but do not to allow full detachment and separation of cells into single cells.Gently remove and discard the PBS-EDTA with a stripette by tilting the plate, but do not to dislodge the colonies.Using a stripette add 8 mL of E8 media to the 10 cm plate aiming to detach and wash the colonies in small clumps and clusters into suspension, by repeated aspiration and flushing of the media through the stripette up to four times with the same 8 mL volume. Collect the media and cells into a new 50 mL Falcon. Repeat this step up to twice more to maximise colony recovery, while avoiding excessive agitation and pipetting, which will result in single cells.",
    "Spin cells at 290 × g and 20°C for 3 min. Discard the supernatant.Resuspend the colonies in fresh E8 base media supplemented with 3.12 mM ROCKi at the desired splitting ratio (1:5–1:30, depending on the growth rate of the hiPSC line).Aspirate the vitronectin solution from pre-prepared plates. Transfer and seed the split colonies into a new vitronectin plate/well.Cryopreservation/freezing of hiPSC:To freeze hiPSC cells, freshly prepare freezing medium (10% DMSO in KSR) at RT. After harvesting the hiPSCs (Steps B2–B7), resuspend the cell pellet in 10% DMSO-KSR and transfer 1 mL of cell suspension per cryovial. It is important that the cells spend minimal time in presence of DMSO at RT. Cryovials should be placed immediately into a Mr. Frosty or appropriate freezing container and into the -80°C freezer and then into liquid nitrogen after 24 h, for long term storage.Note: The volume of freezing medium to prepare will depend on the number of cryovials to be stored. We advise 1 mL of freezing media per cryovial and 2 cryovials per well of a 6-well plate and 6–10 mL or 6–10 cryovials per 10 cm dish at 70–80% confluency. Embryoid Body formation utilizing a feeder-free systemAfter harvesting the hiPSC (as described in Steps B2–B7), add 1 mL of fresh E8 media and pipette the hiPSCs up and down more than usual (3–4 pipetting strokes), to break up clumps and create a single-cell suspension.Using a haemocytometer, count the cells in 10 µL of cell suspension, after adding 10 µL of Trypan blue (dilution factor = 2), and determine cell density:(Number of cells in 3 squares / 3) × dilution factor × 10,000 = Number of cells/mLMake individual, homogenous, and equally-sized EBs using an ultra-low adherent U bottom 96-well plate (1× EB per well).",
    "With the knowledge of the total cell number harvested above, both the desired EB size (cell number) and the overall total number of the individual EBs to be made, can be calculated. For example, if 3 × 106 hiPSCs are harvested = 100× individual EBs of 3 × 104 size can be made. Note: The size of EB may need to be determined for each hiPSC line. However, in our hands, EB sizes of between 1 × 104–5 × 104 cells generate the highest yields of myeloid precursors for both the hiPSC lines used in the generation of this protocol (EBs up to 1 × 105 cells can also work well).  Each individual EB is made up in 100 µL of E8 media supplemented with 50 ng/mL recombinant BMP-4 and 3.12 µM ROCKi. Depending on the desired EB size, create a cell suspension of 1 × 105–10 × 105 cells per mL.For the example calculated above, a cell suspension of 3 × 105 cell/mL should be created to generate individual EBs of 3 × 104 size in 100 µL of supplemented E8 per well of ultra-low adherent U bottom 96 well plate.Transfer 100 µL of hiPSC cell suspension into each well of an ultra-low adherent U bottom 96-well plate.Spin the plate at 800 rpm for 1 min and transfer to a humidified 37°C incubator with 5% CO2.Leave these EBs undisturbed for 48 h and, on day 2 of culture, remove 50 µL of spent media and carefully replace with 50 µL of E8 media supplemented with 50 ng/mL BMP-4 only, aiming to not disturb the forming EB. Repeat for day 3 (see Figure 6). ROCKi can interfere with late EB and germ layer formation.",
    "It is unusual to find more than one EB per well (see Figures 7 and 8); however, providing the appearance of each EB within one well is similar to that seen in Figure 6, with a clear rim and 3D structure, then all EBs within the well can be transferred. Whenever multiple small clumps or a broken and shattered EB appearance is found, the well and cellular material should be discarded.On day 4, prepare gelatin-coated 10 cm dishes. Add 6 mL of 0.1% gelatine solution to a 10 cm dish and incubate in a hood for 1–2 h, allowing the gelatin to coat the entire surface and warm to RT (plates can be pre-prepared and stored at 4°C for 5 days).Remove the gelatin solution from the plate prior to EB transfer.Using wide bore P1000 filter tips (alternatively, P1000 filter tips can be cut higher up their length with a scalpel, to create a wide bore orifice), carefully aspirate the individual EBs which are easily visible, and transfer them to the gelatin-coated plate (Figure 9). The number of EBs per cm2 may need to be determined per hiPSC line, nevertheless, in our experience, up to 35× EBs per 10 cm dish provides a high yield of myeloid precursors.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4361/bioprotoc-12-06-4361-g006.jpgFigure 6.

    "Single EB aspirated into wide bore pipette for transfer into gelatin-coated plate below. Once transferred, gently tilt the plate and remove the spent EB media from the plate, without removing EBs.Slowly add 10–12 mL of fresh EB-Myeloid precursor media supplemented with 50 ng/mL M-CSF, which is critical for myeloid differentiation, and 25 ng/mL IL-3, which is critical for hematopoietic specification and proliferation.Carefully move these plates to a humidified 37°C incubator with 5% CO2. And leave undisturbed for 1 week, to allow EBs to attach to the gelatin (see Figure 10).At day 7, carefully remove spent EB media with a large bore stripette to avoid damaging any unattached EBs. Take care not to dislodge any attached EBs and pass the media through a 70–100 µm strainer over a 50 mL Falcon tube, to catch and retain all the unattached EBs that are in suspension.Return the EBs in the strainer back into the original plate, by inverting the strainer over the 10 cm dish and gently adding fresh EB media supplemented with 50 ng/mL M-CSF and 25 ng/mL IL-3 warmed to RT over the inverted strainer. Continue to take care not to dislodge the attached EBs in the plate.Once the EB media has been exchanged, and EBs returned to their dish, spin the 50 mL Falcon at 290 × g and 20°C for 3 min. At week 3, this tube will contain the harvested myeloid precursors in suspension. Discard supernatant.Add 1 mL of macrophage differentiation media to the cell pellet and observe the appearance of the cells under a microscope, counting them with a haemocytometer (see Step C1).EB media should continue to be exchanged as described in Steps C14–C17 each week. Depending on the hiPSC line, myeloid precursors should be harvested from weeks 3–4 of EB culture.",
    "EBs can be maintained in culture for several months. In our hands, myeloid precursor yields begin to fall from 12–16 weeks.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4361/bioprotoc-12-06-4361-g010.jpgFigure 10. Embryoid Body attachment: 1 week post transfer onto the gelatin plate. Images taken using EVOSTM XL Core imaging system, with a 4× objective.Macrophage differentiationHarvest the myeloid precursors as described in Step C14–C17. Following counting, resuspend the harvested myeloid precursors in the desired volume of macrophage differentiation media supplemented with high concentration 100 ng/mL M-CSF.Seed the cells into the desired culture plates, ideally 0.5 × 106–1 × 106 in approximately 8–10 mL of macrophage differentiation media per 10 cm dish, or alternatively 1.5 × 105 in 3 mL per well of a 6-well plate, or 1.5 × 104 in 150 µL per well on a 96-well plate (see Figure 11a).Transfer the cells to a humidified 37°C incubator with 5% CO2 and leave undisturbed for 5–7 days (see Figure 11b).Cells can then be lifted with 0.5 mM EDTA solution, with or without the help of a cell scraper. The 0.5 mM EDTA solution should be left covering the cells for 10 min. Cells should be recounted and phenotypically characterized by flow cytometry or qPCR, or functionally thereafter (see Figures 12 and 13).Note: The number of macrophages should be similar to the number of myeloid precursors seeded onto the plate, but this number can vary between cell lines and also be dependent on EB size. Cells left in culture for 10–14 days post harvest tend to become fibroblast-like (Figure 11c).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20220312/20220312164521_2949.jpgFigures 11.
