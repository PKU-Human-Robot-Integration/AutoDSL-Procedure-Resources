    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCrypt isolation and establishment of gut organoids\nTiming: Days 0–6\nTissue collection - In the animal facility (10–15 min).\nDissect the most proximal 10 cm of the small intestine, the zone inhabited by H. polygyrus, and flush with 5 mL ice cold PBS using a 5 mL syringe and a 200 μL pipette tip. Cut longitudinally and wash out the remaining intestinal contents. Scrape GENTLY with a coverslip to remove upper mucosa.\nTransfer to a 50 mL Falcon tube with 15 mL ice-cold PBS.\nTransport back to the laboratory on ice.\nCrypt isolation - Back in the lab, work inside a hood.\nTransfer the Falcon tube contents onto a Petri dish, and use scissors to cut gut tissue into small pieces (1–2 mm).\nTransfer to a fresh 50 mL Falcon tube with a 10 mL serological pipette and make up to a total volume of 10 mL with ice-cold PBS.\nPipette up/down with a 10 mL serological pipette GENTLY ×10. Allow settling.\nRemove PBS and repeat wash with 10 mL ice-cold PBS twice more.\nAspirate PBS and add 20 mL 2 mM EDTA in ice-cold PBS and incubate for 30 min at 4°C on a roller.\nAllow tissue fragments to settle, aspirate the PBS-EDTA and add 10 mL ice-cold PBS and mix GENTLY ×10.\nAllow tissue fragments to settle, collect supernatant in a 15 mL tube (this is FRACTION 1).\nRepeat (with more vigorous pipetting each time) until you have 6 fractions.\nTransfer 20 μL from each fraction into a 96-well plate to look at the crypt concentration under a 4× objective in an inverted microscope. Take the crypt-enriched fractions for culture.\nTip: Avoid fractions with a lot of single cells or villi - typically take fractions 2–6 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).",
    "Combine crypt-enriched fractions into a 50 mL Falcon tube through a 70 μm cell strainer.\nWash the cell strainer with 5 mL ice-cold PBS and spin at 300 g for 3 min at 4°C to pellet crypts. Use a swing-out rotor rather than an angled rotor to sediment the crypts,\nTip: If crypts fail to pellet add ice cold PBS (∼10 mL) and repeat at 400 g to help spin down. A swinging bucket centrifuge is needed to pellet the crypts at the bottom of the tubes.\nThaw MG on ice to prevent solidifying. Alternatively, thaw MG at 4°C before starting and keep on ice to prevent solidifying.\nRemove supernatant, add 10 mL ADF Base, and move to 15 mL Falcon for easier pelleting.\nSpin at 100 g for 3 min at 4°C and remove supernatant (this removes single cells) and add 10 mL ADF Base.\nTake 20 μL and count crypts as in step i.\nSpin amount to be plated in a 15 mL Falcon at 300 g for 3 min at 4°C; aim to plate 500 crypts/well/50 μL MG in a 24-well plate.\nRemove supernatant and gently resuspend the pellet in MG (500 μL is enough for ∼12 wells) and plate out on a pre-warmed at 37°C well plate - 50 μL/well.\nTip: Work swiftly as MG solidifies at room temp and above. Avoid it solidifying and bubbles when mixing with crypts (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nIncubate for 10 min at 37°C to allow MG to solidify.\nAdd 500 μL/well of ADF Org + all growth factors (EGF, R-spondin, Noggin and ChiR) to the side of the well to prevent disrupting the MG dome containing crypts.\nChange the media on day 2.\nRemove media without disrupting the MG.",
    "Add 500 μL/well of ADF Org + growth factors (EGF, R-spondin and Noggin).\nIncubate at 37°C.\nCritical: Wash all Falcon tubes, tips and serological pipettes briefly in ADF Base to prevent tissue from sticking to plastics.\nPassaging and freezing organoids\nTiming: every 4/5 days\nTwo days after the first media change (at day 2), organoids will be fully differentiated and start shedding mucus/cells, indicating that they are ready to be split and passaged. Organoids will be fully differentiated every 3–4 days when passage is required. See Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] for examples.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3020-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "Add 10 mL ADF Base and spin at 300 g for 3 min at 4°C. Repeat steps 4–5 until all MG is removed.\nAspirate media and use a P200 to disrupt the pellet and break the organoids (×20 gently).\nAdd 10 mL ADF Base and spin at 100 g for 3 min.\nAspirate media and add 10 mL ADF Base. Take 20 μL and count.\nTip: we want 500 crypts/well/50 μL MG in a 24-well plate.\nSpin amount to be plated in a 15 mL Falcon tube at 300 g for 3 min at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant, add 500 μL MG (enough for ∼12 wells), and plate out 50 μL/well.\nTip: Work swiftly as MG solidifies at room temp and above. Avoid it solidifying and or allowing bubbles to form when resuspending organoid fragments.\nTip 2: When plating for induction experiments, using a Nunc Lab-Tek II Chamber Slide System – 8-well chamber slide, use 30 μL MG per well.\nIncubate for 10 min at 37°C to allow MG to solidify.\nAdd crypt media (ADF Org + growth factors (EGF, Noggin, R-Spondin).\nChange the media every 2 days.\nRemove media without disrupting the MG.\nAdd 500 μL/well of ADF Org + growth factors (EGF, Noggin and R-Spondin).\nIncubate at 37°C.\nNote: The number of crypts per well is very important as too few or too many will affect the growth of the organoids. For stimulation experiments the concentration is lower to improve visibility, 200 crypts/well are enough. Organoids are challenging to establish and maintain. During establishment, it is important to keep all samples on ice when possible and work swiftly. Furthermore, checking the cultures under the microscope every day is essential to keep control of their growth and make sure the passage is performed at optimal times.\nFreezing Organoids.",
    "Aspirate media and add 1 mL ice cold ADF Base/well.\nBreak up MG with a P1000 tip (scrape quite gently).\nCombine into 15 mL Falcon tube (3 wells of organoids/15 mL).\nSpin at 150 g for 10 min at 4°C and aspirate media.\nRepeat steps 4–5 until all MG is removed.\nResuspend in 1 mL Gibco Cell Recovery freezing media.\nTransfer 1 mL to cryovials and freeze at −80°C and put into LN2 the following day. A Mr Frosty container (Nalgene) is ideal for overnight freezing in −80°C.\nNote: To freeze 1 vial of organoid (1 mL), 3 MG droplets are necessary\nThawing Organoids.\nThaw rapidly at 37°C in a water bath.\nSpin at 300 g for 3 min at 4°C and aspirate media\nAdd 1 mL of ADF, transfer to a 15 mL Falcon tube and make up the volume to 10 mL with ice-cold ADF.\nSpin at 300 g for 3 min at 4°C and aspirate media.\nAdd 500 μL MG (enough for ∼12 wells), and plate out 50 μL/well.\nTip: Work swiftly as MG solidifies at room temp and above. Avoid it solidifying and or allowing bubbles to form when resuspending pellet containing organoids.\nIncubate for 10 min at 37°C to allow MG to solidify.\nAdd crypt media (ADF Org + growth factors (EGF, Noggin, R-Spondin and, for the initial cultures only, ChiR).\nChange the media every 2 days.\nRemove media without disrupting the MG.\nAdd 500 μL/well of ADF Org + growth factors (EGF, Noggin and R-Spondin).\nIncubate at 37°C.\nExperimental stimulation of organoids\nTiming: 1–3 days",
    "Organoids should be split at least four times before being used for experimental treatments such as co-culture with cytokines or parasite products (see Table below). For example, the type 2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 can be added, to stimulate preferential differentiation of intestinal stem cells to the goblet cell and tuft cell lineages; conversely, helminth excretory-secretory (ES) products can be administered, which in some cases reverse the effects of these type 2 cytokines.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] In this protocol, test agents are added on day 3, but they can be added at any time chosen by the researcher.\nDay 0 – Stimulate.\nPlate fresh organoids in low concentration (200 crypts/well in 30 μL MG) into Nunc Lab-Tek II Chamber Slide System - 8-well chamber slide.\nAdd 200 μL ADF Org + growth factors (EFG, Noggin, R-Spondin and ChiR) to each well and incubate at 37°C.\nDay 2 – Change media.\nRemove media without disrupting the MG.\nAdd 200 μL/well of ADF Org + growth factors (EGF, Noggin and R-Spondin).\nIncubate at 37°C.\nDay 3 – Change media and add stimulants.\nRemove media without disrupting the MG.\nAdd 200 mL/well of ADF Org + growth factors (EGF, Noggin and R-Spondin) + stimulants (see Table below for examples).\nTake pictures of organoids with an inverted microscope or EVOS imaging system using 4×, 10× and/or 20× objectives.\nIncubate at 37°C.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3020_7.csv\nDay 4 (24 h post-induction) –.\nTake pictures of organoids with an inverted microscope or EVOS imaging system using 4×, 10× and/or 20× objectives.\nDay 5 – Harvest the cultures for assays as below.\nAnalysis of organoids\nTiming: 1–3 days – depends on the method",
    "Depending on the goal of the experiment this may include (11) Morphology by bright field microscopy; (12) Flow cytometry of dispersed single cells; (13) Immunofluorescence of intact or sectioned organoids; and (14) RNA extraction for qPCR or RNA sequencing.\nMorphology by bright field microscopy (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nTake pictures of organoids with an inverted microscope or EVOS imaging system using 4×, 10× and/or 20× objectives.\nAnalyze morphological changes using image software such as ImageJ. A technique for measurement and quantification by the area of organoid images has been described by Lindholm et al.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]\nOrganoid harvest and stain for Flow cytometry.\nHarvest organoids by replacing media with 1 mL cold ADF base and scraping with a 10 mL serological pipette. This detaches the MG from the plate into the media.\nPipette out organoids in MG/media into a 15 mL falcon and top up to 10 mL with cold ADF base. Spin at 300 g for 4 min.\nAspirate off the media and use a P200 to disrupt the pellet (×10, gently).\nAdd 0.5–1 mL TrypLE express and 2000 units/mL DNase II. For 3 wells of organoids, 0.75 mL, for 2, 0.5 mL.\nLeave at 37°C for 20–25 min to dissociate organoids. Place in the 37°C incubator shaker, as shaking should encourage dissociation.\nAt the end of incubation, inactivate TrypLE by adding 5 mL of ADF base with 5% FCS.\nPipette the supernatant 5–10× to dissociate the organoids. They may be visible as distinct organoids before pipetting, after which they present a cloudy cell suspension.\nPass the cell suspension through at 40 μm cell strainer.",
    "Count using trypan blue. Calculate the amount in hand and plate out appropriately for flow. Ideally a million cells for each well should be used, however organoids do not yield this amount. For this reason, 20 × 104 cells/well can be used.\nSpin down 400 g for 5 min the correct amount (usually all that is available) and resuspend in the correct amount of PBS for plating out 100 μL/ well. Plate into a 96-well round-bottomed plate.\nSpin down at 400 g for 5 min at 4°C and wash once more in PBS (100 μL) to get rid of any trace of FBS.\nIncubate with live/dead dye for 30 min at 4°C in the dark (BV506, 1:1000 dilution, use 100 μL /well).\nSpin down at 400 g for 5 min, then wash with 200 μL PBS.\nBlock using rat IgG (1:50, 50 μL per well) for 20 min at 4°C.\nWash using 150 μL FACS buffer (add to the 50 μL in the well, then spin at 400 g for 5 min).\nStain in 50 μL of extracellular stain mix, usually these antibodies are used at a 1:200 dilution. Can stain in FACS buffer, or may need Brilliant Stain Buffer if using 2 or more BD Brilliant dyes). Leave for 35 min at 4°C in the dark.\nAdd 150 μL PBS to wash and spin at 400 g for 5 min.\nResuspend in 50 μL PBS, then fix cells by adding 100 μL of 4% PFA. Leave at room temperature for 15 min.\nSpin down, then wash once with 200 μL PBS.\nPermeabilize cells in 150 μL PBS 1% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature.\nStain in 50 μL of intracellular antibodies suspended in PBS 1% BSA. Leave in the dark at room temperature for 1 h.",
    "If using secondary antibodies for the intracellular stain, wash with 150 μL perm buffer.\nIncubate in 50 μL secondary antibodies, if needed. Leave in the dark for 30 min at room temperature.\nWash twice in 200 μL FACS buffer. The cells can be left in FACS buffer until ready to flow.\nAnalyze the cell suspension with a flow cytometer (or use a cell sorter to isolate a specific cell population for biological assays).\nNote: selection of the fluorescent Ab should be made according to your flow machine. Some examples of Abs we use are on the reagent list.\nIndirect Immunofluorescent Staining of Intestinal Organoids (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nFor fixation, aspirate the medium from each well, wash 2× in cold PBS and immediately fix with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature.\nTip: Once fixed, slides can be stored at 4°C for up to two weeks. Rinse wells once in PBS and store in 500 μL/well PBS. Wrap wells with parafilm to avoid drying out.\nPermeabilize with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 4°C. Depending on the antibody utilized for immunostaining, the detergent concentration or duration of permeabilization may require modification.\nRinse 3 times with PBS/Glycine (1× PBS; 100 mM glycine), 10–15 min per wash at room temperature.\nIncubate with 200 μL/well IF buffer for 45–60 min at room temperature.\nPrimary antibody: Incubate with the primary antibody in Antibody Dilution Buffer overnight (15–18 h) at room temperature.\nRinse 3 times (5–10 min each) with IF Buffer at room temperature with gentle rocking.\nIncubate with fluorescent conjugated secondary antibody in Antibody Dilution Buffer for 40–50 min at room temperature.\nRinse once (5 min) with IF Buffer at room temperature with gentle rocking.\nRinse 2–3 times with PBS (5 min) at room temperature.\nRemove chambers from slides.",
