    "The present research was carried out in accordance with French standards, each participant provided informed consent and procedures were consistent with the guidelines of the American Psychological Association.\n1. Highlighting and reducing age-based stereotype threat on a lab memory test\nParticipants screening\n\t\nRecruit participants in the desired age range (e.g., younger participants: 18−35 years old; older participants: 60−85 years old) for a study on general mental abilities and/or the impact of emotions on various cognitive tasks and questionnaires.\nEnsure that participants are native speakers, have normal or corrected-to-normal vision and hearing, are free of neurological and psychiatric disorders, and have no current depression (Geriatric Depression Scale17) nor abnormal anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory18).\nScreen older participants for cognitive impairment using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)19. Include older adults who meet or exceed a cutoff score corresponding to his/her age and educational level20, and who live at home.\nConditions and experimental design\n\t\nTest each participant individually at home or in local community associations' premises by an experimenter trained at neuropsychological testing.\nRun the study as a single session, but inform participants there are two separate studies.\nUse the \"first study\" as a baseline measure of participants' working memory capacity. In the \"first study\", minimize evaluative pressure, informing participants they will perform a cognitive task currently under elaboration. Encourage participants to do their very best21.\nUse the \"second study\" to evaluate the impact of stereotype threat on participants' working memory capacity. That is, inform participants that they are going to perform a fully validated and diagnostic test of memory capacity.\n\t\t\nRandomly assign participants to one of two conditions (threat versus reduced-threat conditions).\n\t\t\tNOTE: See Figure 1 for a visual depiction of the procedure; full details on this research were published in Mazerolle et al.22.",
    "In the \"threat condition\", simply tell participant that both younger and older adults are participating in the study.\nIn the \"reduced threat condition\", tell participants that both younger and older adults are participating in the study but add that younger and older adults usually obtain the same performances on the ongoing test.\nMemory tests and procedure\n\t\nUse a validated memory test that is typically used in cognitive lab studies. Because ST effects typically occur on difficult tasks, use a difficult test, such as the reading span test23.\nUse two alternative versions of the reading span test (one for the \"first study\" and the other one for the \"second\" study), with different sentences but match them in number of words and in length, frequency, and number of syllables of the last word.\nUse a reading span test that contains 42 sentences: 12 series of two to five sentences with 3 series per length.\nPresent one sentence at a time and instruct participant to read it, at his/her own pace, while memorizing the last word of the sentence.\nAsk participant not to interrupt his reading and not to pause between two sentences.\nHave participant to recall the words immediately after he/she finished reading the last sentence of the block considered.\nDo not require participants' recall being serial but constrain them not to start by recalling the final word of the last sentence read. Do not limit the recall time and invite participants to find as many words as possible.\nDo not inform participants of their errors, and do not give them a second chance to answer.\nCompute the final score of each participant using the mean proportion of correctly recalled words across the 12 series.",
    "2. Highlighting and reducing age-based stereotype threat on short cognitive tests used to screen for predementia in clinical settings\nParticipants screening\n\t\nRecruit older participants aged 60 to 85 for a study on general mental abilities and/or the impact of emotions on various cognitive tasks and questionnaires.\nEnsure that participants live at home, have no history of significant trauma nor chronic illness, have normal or corrected-to-normal vision and hearing, have no current depression (Geriatric Depression Scale17) nor abnormal anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory18).\nConditions and experimental design\n\t\nTest each participant individually at home or in local community associations' premises by an experimenter trained at neuropsychological testing.\nHave participants taking two short cognitive tests used to screen for predementia (or mild cognitive impairment [MCI]): the MMSE19 and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA24) in a counterbalanced order.\nRandomly assign participants to one of the two order (MMSE then MoCA or MoCA then MMSE).\nBefore taking the first test, randomly assign participants to one of two threat conditions (threat versus reduced-threat conditions).\nIn the \"threat condition\", inform participants that both younger and older adults are taking part in the study about memory capacity.\nIn the \"reduced threat condition\", inform participants that both younger and older adults are taking part in the study about memory capacity but add that younger and older adults typically obtain the same performances on the ongoing tests.",
    "Before taking the second test, use an educational intervention to debrief all participants (regardless of the threat condition they were previously assigned) about age-based stereotype threat. Tell participants that \"Numerous studies demonstrated that negative age-related beliefs, especially about memory capacity decline, trigger anxiety, which in turn prevents older adults from performing optimally. Actually, it is well-known that performance on memory tests may not accurately reflect people's true abilities, because performance can be affected by the testing context. In other words, people's negative reputation in an ability domain may impair their performance on tests that assess this stereotyped ability, for example when older adults complete a memory test. Therefore, if you feel anxious during the subsequent memory test, this does not mean that you are unable to complete the tests. It rather probably means that your feelings are affected by the general negative reputation of older adults regarding memory.\"\n\t\tNOTE: See Figure 2 for a visual depiction of the educational intervention; full details on this research were published in Mazerolle et al.25.\nShort cognitive neuropsychological tests and procedure\n\t\nAdministrate the 8 subtests of the MMSE19 (orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, language, copying) to evaluate memory, orientation to time and place, attention and executive functioning, language and visuospatial abilities. Follow Folstein, Folstein and McHugh's administration guidelines19 and compute the final score adding the scores of every subtest. Obtain a final score rated on 30-point scale.\nAdministrate the 8 subtests of the MoCA24 (visuospatial/executive, naming, memory, attention, language, abstraction, delayed recall, orientation) to evaluate memory, orientation to time and place, attention and executive functioning, language and visuospatial abilities. Follow administration guidelines available at www.mocatest.org[href=http://www.mocatest.org/] and compute the final score adding the scores of every subtest. Obtain a final score rated on 30-point scale.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
