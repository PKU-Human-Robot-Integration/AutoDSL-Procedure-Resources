    "The protocol described below has components of a vision training program that is a part of the baseline testing performed on all UC athletes. Some of the components have been studied in research trials and in these instances the protocols were approved by the UC Institutional Review Board and the subjects signed informed consent statements.\n1. Light Board Vision Training\nIt takes about 8 min to complete this training.\n*A Program8-11\nDirect the subject to stand about 18 inches away from the light board and have the subject try to reach the lights in the outer ring. Move the subject closer or farther away if needed in order to reach all of the lights. Additionally, move the light board up and down using a power switch on the side so the subject is at eye-level with the screen in the board.\n\t\tHave the subject stand in a ready position to be able to hit the lights. Have the subject hold his/her hands up to chest level to position the hands in the center of the rings.\nInstruct the subject to hit the lights using both hands as fast as possible and deactivate as many as possible in one minute. Each light will remain illuminated until hit.\n\t\tNote: When a subject successfully hits a light there is a beep that they can hear in addition to the light turning off.\nHave the clinician select the *A program and have the subject hit (deactivate) as many lights as possible in one minute. With experience a subject will become comfortable with the menu for the system and be able to start the *A without assistance from the clinician, if desired.",
    "Record the number of hits per minute for each session to track progress along with the average reaction time in seconds for the hits during the one minute test.\nReaction Test Program11\n\tNote: The Reaction Test Program consists of six different tests, three for the right hand and three for the left hand.\n\t\nInstruct the subject to select the Reaction Test and hit start. The lights for Test 1R (right hand) will light sequentially three times to show the subject which lights they will be hitting. Once the lights are done flashing in sequence, there will be a light to the right that will be lit for the first test. Four horizontal lights to the left of the center ring are utilized for Test 1R and the four to the right of the center are utilized for Test 1L.\nInstruct the subject to hold down the lit light to the right (with right hand) and stand in front of and in the middle of the row of lights that lit up during the demonstration. Have the subject hold the left hand behind his/her back.\nHave the subject scan the four horizontal lights that light up during the demonstration sequence. One of the four lights will come on randomly within five seconds. The distance between each light in the horizontal row is 14 inches. Have the subject move the right hand from the initial light to the reaction light as quickly as possible and deactivate it (Figure 1A-C).",
    "Once the subject completes a pre-determined number of hits, typically 5 times, instruct him/her to press the GREEN light at the bottom of the inner ring of lights. This will show the subject which lights for the next test will be involved. When ready, the subject holds down the lit light on the left, holds the right hand behind the back, and follows the above procedures. Point out to the subject to disregard the bottom green light during these tests as it is used to change from one test to another but is not one of the lights to be hit.\n\t\tNote: Tests 1R and 1L involve a linear random target switch. Tests 2R and 2L are again random, unknown targets, which will appear along an arc in one of eight different planes. It is the middle ring of lights that is used for Test 2R and 2L. Tests 3R and 3L are a simple one light choice using the lights to the right and left of the t-scope.\nRecord the average reaction time for each Test plus an overall Reaction Time.\nConcussion 1-3 Programs (novel programs developed by author JFC).\n\tNote: The three programs are designed to be performed in sequence. The learning effect is seen in normal individuals. However, in concussion patients the learning effect is not seen and is considered as diagnostic for concussion. These programs are used for testing, not training. For the concussion testing the Dynavision *A and Dynavision Reaction Test can be used for baseline assessments. The three concussion tests are also used for concussion assessment but are generally not done by subjects in advance. The three concussion tests are designed to be multi-tasking and executive function tests that the subjects have not seen before7.",
    "Conduct the Concussion 1 program, a one minute test that uses only the middle three concentric rings. The test is similar to the *A test, except the subject has single digit numbers (random numbers 1 through 9) flashing on the programmable screen for one second at eight second intervals. Ask the subject to read the numbers flashed on the screen out loud to the tester while still hitting the buttons that are lighting. The resultant score is the number of hits per minute and a report of missed numbers (if any).\nConduct the Concussion 2 program, which is similar to Concussion 1 in that single digit numbers flash on screen. Instruct the subjects to call out the first number while still hitting buttons, remember it, and then when the second number flashes, add the first and second numbers together and call out the sum of the numbers. The subject continues to hit buttons while calling and adding numbers in pairs.\nConduct the Concussion 3 program, which is similar to Concussion 2 with one additional task; 20% of the buttons are green. The subject is instructed to hit buttons and add numbers in pairs similar to the instructions in 1.3.2. In addition to those tasks, instruct the subject to hit the green buttons and also call out green. Therefore, there are two speaking tasks, calling green while calling and adding numbers in pairs. This is all done while hitting the both colors of buttons.\n2. Brock’s String6,10,12",
    "Hold one end of the Brock string on the tip of the subject’s nose while the other end is tied to a fixed point. The fixed point can be horizontal, elevated or declined with respect to the height of the nose point. Neutral is straight ahead (horizontal). The up or down angle should not be more than 45° in either direction. Initially the string is held in the horizontal position and then typically the elevation is progressed from 10° to 25° to 45° over a time frame where the tasks are challenging but still comfortable. With some people who have prominent noses or eye brows there may be anatomic limitations that need to be observed.\nSpace the five colored beads on a length of string at least 12 inches apart starting about 10 inches from the nose. Instruct the subject to alternate ﬁxation and focus from one bead to the next while noting the visual input of each eye and sensation of convergence (formation of an image at a single point). A measurement is not recorded as this is used as an exercise instead of a test.\n\t\nVary the spacing according to subject’s needs. Needs may be based on sport or task. For example, combat sports such as boxing may need more beads less than 3 feet away, whereas field sports such as football and soccer might need beads around 10 feet (Figure 2A-C).",
    "Alternatively, use a task where the string is six feet and tied off at one end. Many people have a reach from their nose to the tip of their fingers of 4 feet. The farthest bead is placed at the extreme reach of the index finger. The subject touches the bead with his index finger and returns it to the side of the leg, alternating the right and left hands.\nAlternatively, use a wand with tape the color of the ball on the Brock string. Space the tape three inches apart. When performing the exercise, instruct the subject to match the color of the tape on the wand to the color of the ball, calling out each color as he matches ball to tape.\n3. EYEPORT Training13\nFor training 1, place alternating red and blue linear lights in the horizontal position and instruct the subject to sit 24 to 30 inches from the system. Have the subject hit the enter button to hear ten beeps and then follow the lights with his/her eyes. When the exercise is over the subject will hear a beep and should then close his/her eyes and rest until the next exercise.\nFor training 2, place the linear lights in the vertical position and repeat steps for Exercise 1.\nFor training 3, rotate the linear lights to the left from the vertical position and repeat steps for Exercise 1. Rotation is done in stages through 360°. Common stages are 20 degrees at a time providing it is comfortable for the subject.\nFor training 4, rotate the linear lights to the right from the vertical position and repeat steps for Exercise 1.",
    "For training 5, reposition the linear lights so the system touches the end of the subject’s nose. Instruct the subject to follow the lights from near to far and far to near.\n\tNote: Instruct the subject to rest after each exercise before going to the next one. A measurement is not recorded as this is used as an exercise instead of a test.\n4. Accommodative Flippers\nAllow the subject to wear his/her habitual prescriptions. Perform all training binocularly. The power of the flipper lenses used is varied to optimize the training effect. The two powers used should be challenging but not onerous to focus on an object as the flippers are alternated.\nInstruct the subject to hold a 10 x 10 saccades chart at 14 inches from the spectacle plane.\nInstruct the subject to read from left to right while moving the flippers up and down repeatedly. The flippers are moved only after the subject can focus on and read the saccade card.\nTest for one minute or until the 100th character is reached.\nCount and record the number of characters read in the one minute or note the time it takes to read 100.\n5. Tachistoscope\nNote: This training uses a PowerPoint presentation designed by author J Clark.\nHave the subject watch the timed presentation and make note of one or two specific bits of information based on questions posed after the flash. Typically several subjects can work on the projected tachistoscope training simultaneously.\nAs the flashed pictures have numbers and or letters randomly distributed throughout the pictures, have the subject note the numbers/letters. Also, ask additional questions such as player numbers from the photos, teams being played, etc.",
    "Make the tachistoscope training progressively more complicated, by making the flash time shorter and/or the information to be obtained more complicated. (Figure 3A and B). The percentage of questions answered correctly can be recorded.\n6. Pinhole Glasses or Strobe Glasses with Pitch and Catch\nGive groups of subjects, typically two to six subjects, with 1 or 2 balls, pinhole glasses (Figure 4A) or strobe glasses (Figure 4B) and advise to throw the ball(s) around for approximately 2-5 min per session. (Figure 4C and 4D) Two to three sessions per week can be performed.\nIf strobe glasses and pinhole glasses are available, have subjects rotate strobes and pinhole glasses every minute or two. Strobe glass flash speeds start at the faster speeds and are slowed to make the tasks more challenging. Current strobe glasses have 8 speeds so typical starting speeds are 1 or 2, and are slowed to speeds 4 to 6.\nProgress through the pitch and catch tasks throughout the sessions by varying the speed of the flash with the strobes or narrowing the visual field of the pinhole glasses.\nAlso, make the pitch and catch routines more complicated by having subjects turn away from their partner and having to turn and catch. A measurement is not recorded as this is used as an exercise instead of a test.\n7. Saccadic Eye Movement Training6,10,14\nPosition the subject eight feet away from the saccadic eye charts and centered between two saccadic charts, which are positioned about eight feet from the center line. Prior to beginning the exercise, ensure that the subject has full range of eye motion in order to see all letters on the saccadic chart. Adjust the distance from the charts accordingly to gain full vision of the chart.",
    "Note: It is important to change distances to add a dynamic component to the accommodative systems and therefore subjects are asked to stand 8 feet away as opposed to the 18 inches used for light board training. There are vision training programs out there that use only a computer and computer screen and do not exercise the accommodative systems. So vary the lengths at which the tasks are performed. Each saccadic chart is constructed on an 8.5 x 11 inch sheet of paper. Each chart has 10 letters in a 36 point font per vertical line with 10 vertical lines on the chart (Figure 5).\nInstruct the subject to read the charts for one minute each while keeping his/her head still and only moving his/her eyes. Ask the subject to read the first letter on the first line on the first chart and then alternate to the second chart to read the first letter of the first line. This completes one cycle.\nInstruct the subject to read the second letter of the left chart followed by the second letter of the right chart. This completes another cycle. Alternate between charts and letters progressing across the line horizontally. As the subjects complete the first line on both charts, instruct them to move to the next line, etc., for one minute. Record the number of cycles completed in the one minute.\nPlace the charts at eye level and distance them six feet apart. A progression of this training exercise includes using unstable surfaces and varying placement of the charts to enhance eye speed and visual focus.\n8. Near Far Training6,10,14",
    "Utilize two charts for this exercise - a large chart and a smaller one. Use the saccadic eye chart for the large chart. Construct the small chart on a 3.5 x 2.5 inch sheet of paper where there are 10 letters in a 12 point font per vertical line with 10 vertical lines on the chart.\nFix the far chart at eye level with the subject positioned 10 feet from the chart. Have the subject hold the near chart with one hand approximately 4-6 inches from the nose. This allows the subject to see over the near chart to see the far chart (Figure 6A).\nInstruct the subject to keep his head still and only move the eyes. Ask the subject to read the first letter on the first line of the far chart and then alternate to the near chart to read the first letter of the first line. This completes one cycle (Figure 6B and 6C).\nHave the subject scan the eyes to read the second letter of the far chart followed by the second letter of the near chart. This completed another cycle.\nInstruct the subject to alternate between charts and letters progressing across lines horizontally. As the first line on both charts is completed, have the subject move to the next line until the time expires for the one minute session. Record the number of cycles completed in the one minute.\nInstruct the subject to be sure that both eyes come into focus on the near target as well as the far target when alternating from chart to chart.\n9. Stereopsis\nPlace polarizing glasses on the subject and ask if “the Stereo Fly’s wings appear to be standing up at them and in three dimensions?”",
    "Instruct subjects to observe the Stereo Fly at a distance of 14 inches from their nose. If the response is positive, instruct subjects to “reach out and point with a pen to the Stereo Fly’s right wing tip and to hold that position” (Figure 7A).\nRecord the distance between the photo and the center of the pinch with a millimeter ruler (Figure 7B).\n\tNote: The higher the number, in mm, is indicative of better stereopsis when measured on the Stereo Fly15. Based on our experience we have found that 85 mm appears to be the upper limit of the distance from the photo to the center of the pinch3.\nSubscription Required.
