    "All procedures for animal use were approved by the National Yang-Ming University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and complied with the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. 8th edition, 2011”. The anesthetic procedure was performed according to the guideline for the pain control, anesthesia, pre-operative, and postoperative care for the experimental animals from National Yang Ming University, ICAUC-016, 2015, 1st edition.\n1. Animal preparation\nObtain 20 8-week-old wild type C57BL/6 male mice from the National Laboratory Animal Center (NLAC) that weigh around 16-18 grams. Randomly assign these mice into the SG or the sham operation group with 10 mice each.\nStart the mice on chow or a high-fat diet (see Supplemental File[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60719/High fat diet.pdf]) prior to the bariatric or sham surgeries9. Produce diet-induced obesity with at least 2 preoperative weeks of the HFD.\nHouse the mice in the National Yang-Ming University Laboratory Animal Center under a light-dark cycle of 12:12 with light onset at 07:00 A.M. and allow free feeding to standard rodent chow and water.\nRestrict all animals from food but allow free water access on the night before surgery.\n2. General preoperative preparation\nFast the mice for at least 6 hours before the surgery. Induce anesthesia in an induction chamber with 5% isoflurane and oxygen (both 3-4 L/min).\n\t\nCheck the depth of anesthesia ensuring that pinch stimulation (blunt curved serrated smooth micro-forceps) of the hind paw, the forepaw, and the ear does not evoke any motor reflex. Administer antibiotics (25 mg/kg cefazolin) via subcutaneous injections before the operation.\nAssign a particular work zone for surgical procedures. Clean the surgical area and spray the surgical table with 75% alcohol solution before an operation.\nPlace the mouse in the nose cone and maintain anesthesia with 2% isoflurane (2 L/min) and oxygen (4 L/min).",
    "For sleeve gastrectomy and sham operation, after confirming the appropriate depth of anesthesia by toe stimulation, apply the 0.2% Carbomer eye gel on the mouse’s eyes to prevent dry eyes.\nUse an electric razor to shave hair from the abdomen to the sternum. Remove and clean the remaining hair with a depilatory cream. Place and fix the mouse on the surgical table in a supine position.\nDisinfect the abdominal wall of the mouse with povidone-iodine solutions alternating with 75% alcohol for 3 applications.\n3. Sleeve gastrectomy and sham procedures\nMedian laparotomy\n\t\nUse a micro-scissor to make a 1-1.5 cm length midline incision at the upper abdomen.\nStomach and intestine externalization\n\t\nPerform the SG procedure with the aid of a magnifying dissecting microscope or magnifier as necessary to prevent the unpredictable bleeding and hypovolemic shock.\nUse two curved smooth serrated micro-forceps to gently move the stomach and complete externalize it.\nCarefully divide the gastrosplenic ligament connecting the left stomach to the spleen using a cotton-tipped probe and electrocautery as needed, thereby dissecting the gastric fundus from the surrounding spleen and other internal organs.\n4. Stomach isolation and clip\nNOTE: The SG for mice was performed using the new clip applier technique as previously published10.\nStretch the fundus and pylorus of the stomach gently and laterally with forceps, identify the midline (Figure 1 and Figure 2), and carefully apply surgical clips to half of the medial side of the stomach midline from the gastroesophageal junction inferiorly and the lower pole superiorly. Clamp and exclude around 75-80% of stomach, thereby creating the entire lateral sleeve of the stomach (Figure 1 and Figure 2).\nMove the intestine to the bare skin on the side and cover it with a warm-saline moistened gauze and perform intraperitoneal hydration as needed to prevent dehydration and hypothermia.",
    "Resect the lateral clipped stomach, remove the excluded sleeve of the stomach with microscissors and then sterilize the cut edge of the stomach with povidone-iodine solution.\nOversew the clip line with a 5-0 monofilament nonabsorbable suture to ensure no leakage. Knot the ends of the suture and anchor to the clips on either end.\nReturn the stomach and intestine to the proper position in the abdominal cavity and close the abdomen with a running 5-0 monofilament nonabsorbable continuous and discontinuous suture to the fascia and abdominal wall.\nAdminister analgesics with ketoprofen (2-5 mg/kg) and antibiotics with cefazolin (25 mg/kg) intraperitoneally after the whole procedure.\n5. Sham procedure of SG\nPerform a similar procedure as described previously with a midline laparotomy, and externalize the intestine and stomach using 37 °C wet warm saline gauze coverage for 5 min.\nReturn the stomach and intestine to the proper sites of these internal organs.\nClose the abdominal wall carefully as previously described with 2 layers of continuous and discontinuous closure to the fascia and skin using slow or non-absorbable monofilament sutures. Administer analgesics with ketoprofen (2-5 mg/kg) and antibiotics with cefazolin (25 mg/kg) intraperitoneally after the whole procedure.\n6. General postoperative care\nStop isoflurane and continue with a room air flow of 3-5 L/min until the mouse is fully awake.\nKeep watching the mouse while it regains mobility and begins to walk around the cage.\nPlace the mouse in a 30 °C independent incubator for 5 days. Make sure there is only one mouse per cage to prevent the mice from injuring each other.\nReturn free access to a gel diet food (high-fat gel diet: 10% lard, 10% liquid sugar, 57% water) for 3 days after surgery and reintroduce the previous assigned diet 3 days after surgery.",
    "Subcutaneously or intraperitoneally inject ketoprofen (2-5 mg/kg), and cefazolin (25 mg/kg) for 1 day after the operation.\nAssess the mouse body weight weekly through the whole study period. Provide ketoprofen (2-5 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection for pain control once daily as needed if the animal is in distress after the operation.\n\tNOTE: Here, the survival rate of SG was 90% after the learning period.\n7. Metabolic parameter assessment\nFast mice for 6 h, and take baseline blood samples (0 min). Obtain all blood samples from the tip of the tail vein of freely moving mice11,12.\nDeliver 1 mg/g of 50% dextrose by intraperitoneal injection for the glucose tolerance test.\nMeasure the blood glucose from the tips of the tail veins of freely moving mice at 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after glucose administration on duplicate samples using glucometers and test strips.\nKeep the whole blood sample (n = 10 for each group) at room temperature with clotting for 30 minutes.\nCentrifuge the blood sample at 3,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4 °C.\nTransfer the plasma into separate tubes without disturbing blood clots and store at -80 °C.\nStudy the plasma samples at the end of the study using commercial mice ELISA kits for hemoglobin A1c (HBA1c), glucose, cholesterol, and insulin levels according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.\nSubscription Required.
