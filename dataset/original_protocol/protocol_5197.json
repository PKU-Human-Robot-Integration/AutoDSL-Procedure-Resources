    "Anti-tumor cell line assayEffector cells are cultured with 1 x 104 of target cells at an E/T ratio of 5 or 10 in a 96-well round-bottomed plate.Six hours after incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a CO2 incubator, 100 μl of supernatant is collected and LDH activity is measured with an LDH cytotoxicity detection kit in a 96-well flat-bottomed plate.As a positive control, target cells lysed with 2% of Triton X-100 are used.As background controls, effector cells or target cells alone are used.In anti-tumor analysis using the LDH kit, O.D. at 490 nm and 600 nm is measured with a SpectraMax 190. O.D. at 490 nm is subtracted from the O.D. at 600 nm as noise. Killing activity is calculated with following formula: Killing activity = [{(O.D. of ‘effector + target’ - O.D. of medium) - (O.D. of target alone - O.D. of medium)} - (O.D. of effector alone - O.D. of medium)]/(O.D. of positive control - O.D. of target alone) x 100 (%)."
