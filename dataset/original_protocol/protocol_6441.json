    "Electroporation of plasmids into E. coli CA434Pre-chill 1 mm electroporation cuvette in refrigerator overnight.Dilute 1 µl of plasmid solution (10 µg/ml) in 4 µl of dH2O (final concentration 2 µg/ml).Thaw 55 µl electrocompetent E. coli CA434 (prepared in house following standard protocols, https://www.protocols.io/view/Making-your-own-electrocompetent-cells-imsv6m[href=https://www.protocols.io/view/Making-your-own-electrocompetent-cells-imsv6m]) on ice and add the plasmid solution, mixing gently.Transfer the mixture to the cuvette and place in Gene Pulser.Electroporate at 1.8 kV, 200 Ohms, 25 µF.Transfer into 1 ml SOC medium, pre-warmed to 37 °C.Incubate for 1 h at 37 °C, 200 RPM.Dilute in sterile dH2O in ten-fold dilutions (101, 102 and 103).Spread 50 µl of these dilutions onto LA plates (see Recipes) supplemented with chloramphenicol 10 µg/ml (Cm10) and incubate at 37 °C for 24 h or until colonies appear.Pick individual colonies into LB Cm10 and incubate at 37 °C, 200 RPM for 24 h.Anaerobic culturing of recipient bacteriumPrepare anaerobic media YCFAGSC and AMM in broth as 7.5 ml aliquots in Hungate tubes, sealed with butyl rubber septa and 2% agar solutions divided into 100 ml aliquots in Wheaton bottles, with all dispensing and inoculating carried out under CO2 using the Hungate technique as described by Bryant, 1972 (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200324/20200324195232_4385.jpgFigure 1. Culturing of strictly anaerobic bacteria using the Hungate methodology (growth in tubes) and anaerobic workstation (growth on Petri plates)Incubate anaerobic YCFAGSC liquid cultures at 37 °C, without agitation in Hungate tubes.Pour anaerobic agar media into Petri plate (20 ml per plate) within anaerobic workstation (gas mix CO2:N2:H2, ratio 7:11:2) approximately 24 h before use, enabling agar to adjust to anaerobic atmosphere.Incubate anaerobic agar cultures at 37 °C in an anaerobic workstation.Mating of donor E. coli CA434 and recipient bacteriumPrepare 7.5 ml overnight culture of recipient. Donor, recipients and plasmids are described in Table 1.Table 1. Strains and plasmidsimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200324/20200324195307_5178.",
    "jpg*pBP1, pCB102, pCD6 and pIM13 (replicons of these plasmids). ColE1 (Gram-negative replicon), catP (chloramphenicol resistance gene), traJ (origin of transfer) and MCS (multiple cloning site).Inoculate donor E. coli CA434 in 40 ml of LB Cm10 in 50 ml conical centrifuge tubes and incubate at 37 °C, 200 RPM overnight.Centrifuge donor overnight culture at 1,200 × g for 10 min.Decant supernatant and resuspend pellet in 20 ml of anaerobic PBS.Centrifuge donor again at 1,200 × g for 10min.Decant supernatant in anaerobic cabinet.Transfer overnight culture of recipient bacterium (grown as described in Steps B1 and B2) to anaerobic cabinet.Resuspend donor pellet in 1 ml of recipient overnight culture in anaerobic cabinet.Spot 100 µl of this solution on the centre of AMM agar plate and incubate in the anaerobic cabinet at 37 °C for 48 h.Scrape mating mix off centre of AMM plate with sterile loop and suspend in 500 µl of anaerobic PBS.Spread 50 µl of this solution on to the YCFAGSC plates supplemented with either 5 or 7.5 µg/ml chloramphenicol and incubate anaerobically at 37 °C until colonies appear (usually 48 to 96 h).Restreak single colonies on fresh YCFAGSC plates supplemented with either 5 or 7.5 µg/ml chloramphenicol and incubate anaerobically at 37 °C until single colonies appear. This may take 3 days incubation.Diagrammatic representation of the optimised conjugation protocol shown in Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200324/20200324195410_4335.jpgFigure 2. Detailed diagrammatic representation of the optimised conjugation protocol for Roseburia inulinivorans and Eubacterium rectale. Supplemented with 5 or 7.5 µg/ml chloramphenicol (Cm5 or Cm7.5).Verification of putative transconjugantsIt is good practice to perform various tests to confirm the validity of transconjugants. Some simple tests can readily eliminate bacteria that are not transconjugants, and can save time and expense.Incubate putative transconjugants aerobically on AMM agar at 37 °C.",
    "The recipient bacterium is incapable of aerobic growth while the donor E. coli bacterium will grow.Gram-stain using standard procedures. Coccus species are common contaminants in gut microbiology and are easily differentiated from the rod-like Roseburia and Eubacterium by Gram-staining.PCR amplify the 16S rRNA gene directly from colonies or liquid culture using the universal bacterial 16S rRNA gene primers FD1 and RP2 (Table 2) (annealing temp. 52 °C), generating an amplicon of 1,495 bp. PCR amplification conditions are provided in Table 3.Table 2.

The primers PS#MTL-for and PS#MTL-rev (Table 2) (annealing temp 60 °C) amplify a 514 bp region incorporating sections of catP gene and ColE1 Gram-negative replicon.Expected results and comments are described in Table 4.Table 4. Verification procedures for putative transconjugantsimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200324/20200324195640_8214.jpgVerification of autonomous plasmid replication by Southern blottingExtract DNA from transconjugants using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification kit, following the manufacturer's instructions.Digest 1 µg of extracted DNA with HindIII for 3 h at 37 °C to produce restriction fragments of various sizes.Note: HindIII only cuts the plasmid once, resulting in a single linear fragment, whereas restriction of the genomic DNA results in fragments of various sizes. Separate restriction fragments by size by gel electrophoresis (0.8% agarose, TBE).Photograph gel image with transilluminator to facilitate size inference in the final blot.Gently rock gel in depurination solution (0.",
    "25 M HCl) for 7 min and rinse in ddH2O (double distilled water).Gently rock the gel in denaturation solution (0.5 M NaOH, 1.5 M NaCl) for 30 min three times and rinse in ddH2O.Gently rock the gel in neutralisation solution (0.5 M Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 3 M NaCl) for 30 min three times and rinse in ddH2O.Transfer DNA from gel to nylon membrane using the Hybaid blotter (1.5 h) and UV-crosslinked.Create probe by digesting pMTL83151 with HindIII and ApaLI. This produces two fragments (~3,000 bp and ~1,500 bp), the smaller of which is specific to a region common to all of the plasmids, but not present in the recipient chromosome. Gel purify the smaller fragment and use as probe template DNA.Perform Southern blotting with DIG High Prime DNA Labelling and Detection Starter Kit II, following the manufacturer's instructions.Visualise hybridizing bands by exposing membrane to x-ray film.This protocol enables the establishment and verification of autonomously replicating plasmids transferred into Roseburia inulinivorans and Eubacterium rectale and will provide an essential tool in investigating the biochemistry and physiology of these important organisms by genetic manipulation."
