    "The study was conducted according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical University of Warsaw (KB/7/2022). Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study.\nNOTE: The described procedures of the advanced skin model preparation can be performed with the use of either commercially available primary skin cells and cell lines or with the primary cells isolated from patients. Commercial cells are supplied with the relevant documents, and their usage in research for most countries does not require any additional approval. However, for some countries, it is obligatory, thus, it must be checked with the Local Ethical Committee regulations. If the primary cells isolated from patients ought to be used in the research, first, the study must be approved by the Local Ethical Committee, and it needs to be conducted according to their strict guidelines. Furthermore, written informed consent must be collected from all skin tissue donors. The isolation of primary skin cells was not the subject of this article, but exemplary isolation procedures can be found in Kosten et al. (keratinocytes)18, Ścieżyńska et al. (melanocytes)19, Kröger et al. (fibroblasts and mast cells)20. Most of the normal skin cells and cell lines have a safety level of BSL1 class; they do not cause any threats. However, the used laboratory equipment needs to meet the standards for animal and human cell culture under controlled conditions.\n1. Skin cell culture",
    "NOTE: Skin cell cultures must be carried out in flasks dedicated to adherent or suspension cells (depending on the cell type) at 37 °C and a carbon dioxide content of 5% in an incubator. Activities related to their cultivation and use for research require sterile conditions and must be performed in a laminar chamber after exposure to ultraviolet C (UVC) rays for 15-30 min. Obtaining cell suspensions, which are then used to create the two- and three-dimensional models, requires the implementation of procedures depending on the cell type (for adherent cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and melanocytes - step 1.1, for non-adherent cells of mast cells - step 1.2)(Figure 3). For different culture flask sizes, the volumes of all reagents (such as medium, phosphate-buffered saline, or trypsin solution) used in the described methods are listed in Table 3. Parameters dependent on the type of cells (e.g., concentration and composition of reagents, centrifugation method, etc.) are sorted in Table 4. Cell densities used for seeding are shown in Table 5. All these tables are included at the end of this section.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65773/65773fig03.jpg\nFigure 3: Adherent and non-adherent cell cultivation. The general step-by-step procedure of adherent and non-adherent cell cultivation (numbers correspond with the descriptions of steps 1.1 and 1.2).

Incubate the flask at 37 °C and control the detachment of cells from the surface on the optical microscope.",
    "Suspend the detached cells in at least a double amount of full-growth medium or trypsin neutralizer to deactivate trypsin (2:1) (for volumes, refer to Table 3, and for reagents, refer to Table 4). Quantitatively transfer the content of the flask into the 15 mL tube.\nTake a small volume (20 µL) of cell suspension into a 1.5 mL tube and count the cells with a manual or automatic hemocytometer.\nCentrifuge the tube (parameters in Table 4), remove most of the supernatant, and resuspend the cell pellet in the small amount of the remaining liquid. Then, add enough fresh medium to obtain the pre-centrifugation volume (volume in Table 3) if the cell density is appropriate to seed or recalculate the required volume of the new medium.\n\t\tNOTE: Some cells, such as melanocytes, are very sensitive to centrifugation, thus avoid the necessity to centrifuge them again in a short time distance.\nPrepare the cell suspension of the required density (cells/mL, cell density in Table 5) for the experiment (2D/3D mono- or multi-cultures of skin cells).\n\t\tNOTE: If cells are to be further cultured, return 5,000-8,000 cells/mL to a new flask and add fresh medium (volume in Table 3).\nObtaining a suspension of non-adherent cells\n\t\nRemove the medium with the cell suspension from the culture flask and quantitatively transfer it into the 15 mL tube.\nTake a small volume (20 µL) of the cell suspension into a new 1.5 mL tube.

Preparation of skin cell spheres\nNOTE: To create spheres, the use of the hanging drop method is described in step 2.1 (Figure 4), while the approach focused on limiting cell adhesion is shown in step 2.2 (Figure 5). Nevertheless, as spheres are very small and can be unstable, activities carried out under these methods require patience, delicacy, and slow actions.\nThe hanging-drop method\n\t\nUse an appropriate cell density to achieve the desired sphere size (recommended cell density 5 x 105 cells/mL, Table 5).\nPipette 20 µL of the cell suspension on the lid of a Petri dish or a multi-well plate (Figure 4A).\nCover the dish/plate with the bottom part and gently flip it (hanging drops will be automatically created on the lids, Figure 4B).\nFill the Petri dish/wells of the plate with a sterile water/PBS solution to avoid evaporation of the medium from droplets.\nIncubate the droplets for 48-72 h at 37 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The gravity pulls the cells down, and the lack of accessible surface prevents cell attachment to the vessel and promotes cell aggregation. However, some cell types may require longer incubation.\nBefore performing the next step, fill the wells of the new plate (or use the old plate with removed water/PBS from the wells) with the full growth medium (100 µL).\n\t\tNOTE: Befor the next step, take 200 µL tips, remove 1/5 of each tip end, and sterilize before use.",
    "Transfer the cell spheres to the wells of the multi-well plate by using sterile pipette tips with a cut end. Take 200 µL tips, remove 1/5 of each tip end, and sterilize before use (Figure 4C).\n\t\tNOTE: This step may be difficult, as the liquid flow during the dish/plate flipping can damage the spheres.\nIncubate the transferred spheres for 1 day in the multi-well plate at 37 °C before performing any further experiments (for example, compound addition, cytotoxicity assays, sphere introduction to equivalents) (Figure 4D).\nThe method of limiting cell adhesion\n\t\nBefore the cell seeding, cover the wells of the U-bottom plate with a surfactant solution (e.g., Pluronic F-127, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol)21. Prepare and add 100 µL of 1% surfactant solution in PBS into each well. Incubate the plate with the solution for 24 h at 37 °C (Figure 5A-C). Store the plate longer if needed but maintain the fluid level by adding more PBS buffer.\nPrepare the cell suspension in the desired cell density in 50 µL per well (recommended cell density while seeding 2 x 105/mL, Table 5).\nRemove the surfactant solution from the wells before seeding the cells to avoid cell membrane disruption by lysis (Figure 5D).\nAdd the cell solution to the plate and incubate for 24 h at 37 °C to reach cell aggregates (Figure 5E). After approximately 1-3 days, spheres will be formed (Figure 5F) and are ready to use for any further experiments.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65773/65773fig04.jpg",

Preparation of full-thickness skin equivalents\nNOTE: The development of the full-thickness (epidermis and dermis) skin equivalents can be divided into three steps (Figure 6): the preparation of the artificial dermis layer with the occurrence of typical dermal cells (such as fibroblasts and mast cells, Figure 6A), seeding of cells included in the artificial epidermis (mostly keratinocytes and melanocytes, Figure 6B) and vertical growth of keratinocytes with a possible keratinization process (formation of the stratum corneum, Figure 6C). The preparation of full-thickness skin equivalents is described in step 3.1 (3.1.1-3.1.10). If a less advanced skin equivalent is needed (e.g., only the epidermis type), the selected cell type (such as keratinocytes) can be seeded directly onto the commercially available collagen or polycarbonate membranes and also cultivated with the possibility of inducing the keratinization process (move directly to steps 3.1.9-3.1.10).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65773/65773fig06.jpg",

Transfer a proper number of dermal cells to a 1.5 mL tube (500 µL of fibroblasts and 500 µL of mast cells, according to cell densities in Table 5) and centrifuge the cells (300 x g, 3 min, RT).\nRemove the supernatant and gently resuspend the cells in the mixture of 695 µL of water/100 µL of PBS (10x)/ 5 µL of NaOH.\n\t\tNOTE: If 1 mL of the total solution is not enough, use Table 6 to recalculate the volumes of each reagent.\nAdd 200 µL of collagen solution to the mixture and gently mix it by pipetting.\n\t\tNOTE: Be careful, as the consistency of the mixture will be dense.\nAdd 200 µL of the prepared mixture to the insert in 24-well plate. For a model without the stratum corneum, add 500 µL to each well of the 24-well plate.\nIncubate the plate for 10 min at room temperature (RT) and then transfer it to the incubator for 30 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Check if the hydrogel has polymerized before any other action.\nBefore the cell seeding on the surface of the hydrogel, rinse it with a PBS buffer (500 µL/well).",
    "Determine the proper number of epidermal cells (e.g., keratinocytes and melanocytes; in a ratio of 15:1) to be seeded on top of the hydrogel. Prepare the cell mixture in 500 µL of the DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS (add 250 µL of keratinocytes and 250 µL of melanocytes, cell densities are mentioned in Table 4) and add it gently to the wells.\n\t\tNOTE: In some cases, it is better to first seed melanocytes and allow them to spread well on the hydrogel, and after an additional 24 h, remove the medium and seed keratinocytes. In that case, add 250 µL of cell suspension and 250 µL of the medium.\nIncubate the plates at 37 °C for 2-5 days, depending on the speed of cell growth, with medium exchange (with a decreasing concentration of FBS from 10% up to 1%) every 48 h and cell monitoring performed on the optical microscope.\nIf the keratinization process is to be induced after obtaining a monolayer of keratinocytes on top of the hydrogel, use the FBS-free medium additionally supplemented by calcium ions and L-ascorbic acid for an additional 2-7 weeks (in the concentration of 1.5 µM CaCl2 and 50 µg/mL L-ascorbic acid).\n\t\t​NOTE: The time of the incubation depends on the used keratinocytes and their differentiation speed.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\nReagent,The equation for calculating the volume of a reagent,The equation for calculating the volume of a reagent,Example calculations\nReagent,The equation for calculating the volume of a reagent,The equation for calculating the volume of a reagent,(for a final volume = Vtotal of 1 mL)\ntype I collagen solution,imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65773/65773eq01.jpg,imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65773/65773eq01.jpg,(Ccollagen = 10 mg/mL)\ntype I collagen solution,imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65773/65773eq01.jpg,imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65773/65773eq01.jpg,0.2 mL = 200 μL\nPBS (10x),imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65773/65773eq02.jpg,imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65773/65773eq02.jpg,0.1 mL = 100 μL\n1 M NaOH,imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65773/65773eq03.jpg,imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65773/65773eq03.jpg,0.005 mL = 5 μL\nsterile H2O,imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65773/65773eq04.jpg,imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65773/65773eq04.jpg,0.695 mL = 695 μL",

Identification of cell types in a 3D skin model by cell staining methods\nNOTE: To confirm that the developed skin model consists of the expected cells it is good to perform cell staining. It is a crucial step before any target experiments can be performed on a given model22. In the case of 3D skin models, it is necessary to embed a given model in paraffin and to prepare microscopic slides with the artificial tissue cut on a microtome (step 4.1) before cell staining (Figure 7).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65773/65773fig07.jpg\nFigure 7: Basic steps of a 3D skin model embedding, cell staining, and microscopic observations.

Repeat the washing step with PBS.\nBefore embedding, dehydrate the skin equivalent by incubating in increasing concentrations of ethanol solutions: 50% (15 min), 70% (15 min), 96% (2x, 30 min), and 99.8% (2x, 30 min).\nPut the fixed and dehydrated skin equivalent in the mold filled with paraffin.\n\t\tNOTE: Place the equivalent in an appropriate orientation.\nCover the mold with the cassette and add more paraffin on top. Let it solidify for up to 30 min at RT.\nFreeze the paraffin-embedded skin equivalent for at least 1 h at -80 °C.\nTurn on the microtome, insert the paraffin-embedded skin equivalent, and cut 5 µm slices. Place the cut artificial tissue slices on the microscopic slides and dry them for at least 8 h at 37 °C.",
    "Immerse the slides in xylene (2x, 10 min), and next rehydrate the slides with the decreasing ethanol concentrations 99.8% (5 min), 96% (5 min), 70% (5 min), and 50% (5 min).\nRemove the slides from the ethanol solution and rinse them twice with water (5 min).\n\t\tNOTE: Traditional cell staining is performed either by applying specific dyes (Hematoxylin, Eosin23) or by using antibodies selectively targeting biomarkers (including collagen 1A2 for fibroblasts, cytokeratin 14 for keratinocytes, melan-A or tyrosinase for melanocytes24). A routine hematoxylin and eosin staining can be made by following the protocols prepared by different companies (step 4.2). On the other hand, if immunofluorescent or immunohistochemical staining is required, the procedure is different and significantly longer (steps 4.3 and 4.4). To avoid unspecific reactions, use the primary antibodies produced in different species and next the dedicated secondary antibodies.\nHematoxylin and eosin staining of 3D skin models\n\t\nStain the microscopic slide in hematoxylin solution for 3 min at RT.\nWash the slides in an acidified alcohol solution for 1 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Prepare the acidified alcohol solution by mixing 2 mL of 35%-38% hydrochloric acid with 98 mL of 99.8% ethyl alcohol.\nNext, wash the slide in 0.1% sodium bicarbonate solution to obtain a visible, delicate blue-violet color.\n\t\tNOTE: To obtain 0.1% sodium bicarbonate solution, dissolve 100 mg of sodium bicarbonate in 100 mL of ultrapure water.\nWash the slides with 95% ethanol for 1 min.\nStain the microscopic slide in eosin solution for 1 min at RT.\nWash the slides with 95% ethanol for 1 min and 99.8% ethanol for 2 min.\nWash the slides with xylene for 2 min each twice.\nMount in balsam and put a coverslip at the top of the slide.
