    "This protocol follows the guidelines of the institutional human research ethics committee.\n1. Downloading the DICOM images\nDownload the DICOM images and transfer them in the workstation dedicated to the segmentation, with the 3D software installed. If planning to work on a personal computer, anonymize the DICOM data.\n2. Importing the HRCT study on the 3D Slicer software\nIn the software opening screen (corresponding to the Welcome to Slicer section in the drop-down menu) select Load DICOM Data. Alternatively, select the DCM icon in the upper left corner of the toolbar.\nIn the upper left corner of the DICOM Browser panel select Import, then select the location of the HRCT study. Select the folder with the DCM images, and then select Import.\nNow that the HRCT study has been successfully imported, click on the Load button.\n3. Creating the Segments\nCreate segments in the Segmentations section of the drop-down menu or directly in the sub-section Segment Editor found in the drop-down menu’s Segmentation section, or again as a dedicated icon in the toolbar.\nIn the drop-down menu next to Master Volume, select the HRCT study.\nSelect Add and create three new segments, which will be automatically named Segment 1, 2 and 3. Double click on each one and rename them respectively “tlv” (Total Lung Parenchyma), “ggo” (Ground Glass Opacities) and “cons” (Consolidations). If in the HRCT study additional pathological findings coexist, such as pleural effusion, lung cancer, fibrotic areas and so on, create additional segments. The same applies to artifacts.\n4. Definition of the TLP segment\nNOTE: An accurate definition of the TLP segment is fundamental, as it will be used for masking the HRCT during the definition of the GGO and CDs segments.",
    "As a first step, in the Segment Editor section, after selecting the TLP segment, choose the Threshold instrument.\nSet a threshold large enough to include both the healthy lung parenchyma and the ground glass opacities. Using the values reported in scientific literature with the necessary adjustments to comply with the textbook definition of GGO, we found that setting the threshold between -1000 HU and -250 HU works well6,14,15,16,17. Then select Apply.\nThe segment so defined will include both the air inside the lungs and the air outside the chest (i.e., the air outside the patient). In order to isolate the lung parenchyma, use the Islands tool, found in the Segment Editor, and choose Keep selected island. Left click inside the chest so that anything outside the chest will be excluded from the segment.\nNext, include any area of consolidation inside the TLP segment. The consolidations usually have attenuation values (Hounsfield Units: HU) similar to those of soft tissues that constitute the chest wall and the mediastinum. This is the reason why the Threshold instrument cannot be used for this purpose and the consolidations will need to be added manually, using the Scissors and Paint tools found in the segment editor.\n\t\nUse the Scissors tool to add portions of lung parenchyma to the segment. Choose the Fill Inside operation, select Free Form as the shape and Symmetric as the slice cut. Choose a thickness appropriate to the size of the consolidation (e.g., from 3 to 20 mm); and then, start progressively adding small portions of TLP, until the consolidation has been completely included.",
    "The Paint tool is easier and sometimes faster to use, but might be less precise, depending on the area to include. When the Sphere Brush option is active, this tool can add 3D portions of lung parenchyma to the segment. The size of the brush can be easily modified.\nWhile adding the consolidations to the TLP segment, do not include portions of thoracic wall or mediastinum. This could prove difficult as in patients affected by COVID19 consolidations adjacent to the posterior thoracic wall are quite common. Use the Erase tool to correct the segmentation or select Undo to discard the last action.\nAt this stage, use the smoothing algorithm once more to delete small imperfections that might have occurred during the manual part of the segmentation. Now the TLP segment definition is concluded.\n5. Definition of the GGO segment\nTo define the GGO segment, use the threshold tool.\n\t\nSelect the GGO segment.\nSet the threshold between -750 HU and -150 HU.\nBefore selecting Apply, go to the Masking section right underneath and select TLP in the Editable Area drop down menu. In the Overwrite Other Segment drop-down menu, select None. This is extremely important as, if skipped, once defined the GGO segment, also the TLP segment would be modified. This must be avoided, as the TLP segment is the mask on which all the other segments are defined.\nNow select Apply.",
    "At this point it will probably be necessary to use the smoothing algorithm once again, in order to exclude all the small vessels and the physiological interstitial elements that have a density similar to that of ground glass from the segment. Start with a Kernel size of 3 mm and, if needed, increase it progressively, to a maximum of 6-7 mm. Note that increasing the Kernel size too much might determine the loss of small areas of ground glass, which would be left outside the GGO segment. Because of this, the smoothing algorithm should be used with the proper caution.\nIn this case too, apply needed corrections with the Paint, Scissors and Erase tool. During this phase remember to keep the TLP mask active at all times to avoid including portions of chest wall adjacent to the “ground glass” areas inside the segment. This is because, if erroneously segmented, they would automatically be excluded.\nWhen obtaining this segment, pay close attention to the possible presence of artifacts generated by movements of hearth and diaphragm (this happens if the patient could not hold his breath during the exam). If present and previously included in the TLP segment, eliminate these artifacts from the “ground glass” segment, for example through the Islands tool with the Remove Selected Island option or using the Scissors and Erase tools. Depending on the study’s goal, the artifacts might be segmented separately, using a dedicated segment or included in the TLP segment and excluded from other segments. Now the GGO segment has been defined.\n6. Definition of the CDs segment\nTo define the CDs segment, proceed the same way as to define the GGO segment.\n\t\nSelect the CDs segment. Be sure to work with the TLP masking always active.",
    "Set an adequate threshold. For consolidations the range varies, roughly, from -150 HU to 100 HU.\nApply the smoothing algorithm varying the Kernel size as needed.\nUse a combination of the tools Scissors, Erase, Paint and Islands in order to keep inside the segment only the real consolidations, excluding large vessels, pleural effusions, artifacts, disventilatory bands and other non COVID-related lesions.\nIf needed, apply a final smoothing might be applied.\n7. Saving the segments\nSave segments as an “.nrrd” file, or convert to binary label maps from the \"Data\" module.\n8. Extracting volumes from the defined segments.\nFrom the Segment Statistics module, obtain a table with details on volume and surfaces of the segments.\nSubscription Required.
