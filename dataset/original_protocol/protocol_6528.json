    "Master wafer microfabricationMicrofabrication can be tedious and complex process for which training is often required by the clean room staff. Each clean room is likely equipped with different instruments that have unique settings and operating procedures that may differ from the following microfabrication protocol. Use caution and adjust microfabrication protocol according to your local conditions. Once the process is mastered, the master wafer of “yeast machine” complexity can be produced in 4 h (Figure 2).Turn on the mask aligner, gas and vacuum lines, and the UV lamp.Set hot plates to 65 °C and 95 °C.Cover the surface of spin coater with aluminum foil to minimize SU-8 contamination.Rinse the polished side of the silicon wafer with acetone, isopropanol, and water sequentially to remove any dirt. Blow both sides of the wafer with compressed N2 after the rinse with each solution until the wafer is completely dry to the eye.Clean and activate the wafer surface with O2 plasma cleaner at 6 mbar for 6 min.Center the wafer on the chuck of a spin coater with polished side up.Open the vacuum line to hold the wafer in place and make sure that it is perfectly centered, otherwise SU-8 will not spread evenly.Program the spin coater according to the SU-8 manual. We used 500 rpm for 10 s and 6,000 rpm for 30 s. These settings are not necessarily consistent in time as they depend on SU-8 age and environmental conditions.Spread SU-8 2000 epoxy-based resin of known thickness on the silicon wafer. There are twelve variants of the SU-8 2000 resin that differ in their viscosities. With them resin layer of 0.5 µm to 200 µm thickness through a single coating process can be made. Since the “yeast machine” is composed of two layers that overlap, one 4.",
    "5 µm thick that serves for cell chambers and the other 25 µm thick that serves for nutrient channel, start with the thinner one. For 4.5 µm thickness use SU-8 2005 resin.Pour 1 ml/in of wafer diameter (4 ml for 4-inch wafer) in the center and try to avoid bubbles by pouring SU-8 resin close to the wafer surface.Wait 3-5 min for gas and bubbles to rise.Run the pre-prepared program of the coat spinner.Once finished, release vacuum and remove the wafer from the chuck. If SU-8 layer is not evenly spread, clean the wafer with isopropanol and repeat the procedure from Step A4.Transfer the wafer with tweezers directly to 95 °C hot plate and “soft-bake” it for 2 min.Transfer the wafer with tweezers to the mask aligner. Epoxy-based resin is photosensitive and it solidifies through cross-linking once it is exposed to high-energy photons from the UV light. The chrome mask is placed above the silicon wafer covered with resin and the silicon wafer is exposed to UV light only through the pattern on the mask. Use the exposure duration of 4.5 s with the vacuum contact between the mask and the wafer. The exposure energy of the UV lamp we use is close to 20 mJ cm-2 s-1.Remove the wafer with tweezers from the aligner and place it on a hot plate for 3 min at 95 °C for a post exposure bake.Take the wafer with tweezers off the hot plate and let it cool down to room temperature in the chemical hood. Transferring the wafer directly into the developer can cause cracking.Pour SU-8 developer in a glass dish making sure there is enough of it to cover the wafer completely.Submerge the wafer into SU-8 developer.",
    "This will remove the parts of the resin that did not solidify during the exposure to UV light.Agitate the wafer for 2 min by hand.Rinse the wafer gently with isopropanol wash bottle and dry it carefully with compressed N2.Check the patterns under optical microscope. If some microcracks (submicron thin dark lines) are visible, put the wafer on 95 °C hot plate for 5-10 min. This will completely cure microcracks.Repeat the same procedure (Steps A6-A22) with adjusted parameters for the 25 µm thick nutrient channel layer as follows in Steps A24-A32.Spin SU-8 2025 in two steps, 500 rpm for 10 s and 4,000 rpm for 30 s.“Soft bake” the wafer for 3 min at 65 °C and 6 min at 95 °C.Transfer the wafer with tweezers to the mask aligner and be careful to align the patterns of the nutrient channel on the mask properly with the existing cell chamber pattern on the wafer. To do this, use the alignment crosses on the mask.Expose the wafer to UV light for 8 s with the vacuum contact between the mask and the wafer.Remove the wafer with tweezers from the aligner and place it on a hot plate for 1 min at 65 °C and 6 min at 95 °C for post exposure bake.Take the wafer with tweezers off the hot plate and let it cool down to room temperature in the chemical hood.Submerge the wafer into SU-8 developer and agitate for 5 min by hand.Rinse the wafer gently with isopropanol wash bottle and dry it carefully with compressed N2.Check the patterns under optical microscope. If some microcracks (submicron thin dark lines) are visible, put the wafer on 95 °C hot plate for 5-10 min. This will completely cure microcracks.",
    "Check the dimensions of the patterns on the master wafer using Dektak 150 surface profiler. If the dimensions are not correct (up to 10% errors are fine), make new master wafer.Finally, put the master wafer in a Petri dish and treat it with (3-Mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane 95% for 1 h in vapour phase by placing the wafer close to a plastic cup with a few drops of silane in a vacuumed dessicator. Be careful to do this in a chemical hood, as silane is a toxic compound.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200701/20200701084127_6748.jpgFigure 2. Microfluidic device fabrication. Epoxy-based resin is spread on a silicon wafer and illuminated with the UV light through a custom designed chrome mask. Soluble part of the resin is washed off and a new cycle of resin deposition can be made depending on the number of layers of the microfluidic device. The master wafer is silanized and used as a re-usable negative mold to produce microfluidic chips. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is then poured on the master wafer and cured until it is polymerized. The PDMS chip is bonded with a glass coverslip by plasma bonding. The final microfluidic chip is used to grow cells and deliver nutrients. The thinner parts are the cell chambers, and the thicker part is the main nutrient channel. This figure is modified from the original article (Marinkovic et al., 2019).Casting the “yeast machine” in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)Now that the desired pattern on the master wafer is made, it can be used as a negative for replica molding of the “yeast machine” chip with the help of PDMS. PDMS is a transparent biocompatible silicon polymer permeable to gases. It is a viscous fluid when it is monomeric and it is elastic once it homopolymerizes in a reaction catalyzed by a curing agent.",
    "Mix PDMS base and curing agent in a plastic weighing dish at a mass ratio of 10:1. When casting the whole PDMS mold for the first time use 30 g of PDMS base and 3 g of curing agent. Once only the “yeast machine” part is cut out, it is sufficient to re-cast only 3 g of PDMS base and 0.3 g of curing agent.Mix well with a pipet tip or a similar device.Degas the PDMS in a vacuum desiccator until all bubbles disappear, approximately 30 min.Pour degassed PDMS over the master wafer in a Petri dish. If some bubbles appear again, degas the whole wafer until the bubbles are gone.Cure PDMS at 65 °C for 2 h minimum or overnight in a laboratory oven. Assembling the “yeast machine”For each experiment always use a newly assembled microfluidic chip. “Yeast machine” cannot be recycled for additional experiments.Gently cut the PDMS in rectangular shape around the patterns. Be careful not to crack the master wafer by putting too much pressure on the scalpel. It is also advisable to let the cured PDMS cool down to room temperature to avoid damage to the master wafer.Carefully peel off the PDMS from the master wafer.Inspect the PDMS and its patterns under the microscope in order to detect possible defects. If defects come from a damaged master wafer, make new master wafer.Place the cut PDMS on a cutting mat with pattern side up.Punch out carefully the holes at each end of the nutrient channel with the biopsy punch. Always use a sharp biopsy punch and check under a microscope that there are no cracks in the hole, otherwise the media might leak.Clean the surface of the PDMS and glass cover slips using tape.Place the PDMS pattern side up and glass cover slip in plasma cleaner.",
    "Turn on the vacuum pump and close the plasma cleaner.Set the power to high to ignite the plasma.After pink glowing plasma appears, wait for 1 min and turn off the power.Open the valve of the plasma cleaner gently to allow air to flow in. It is safe to turn off the vacuum pump now.Immediately and carefully place the PDMS pattern side down onto glass cover slip side that was exposed to plasma.Use tweezers to touch gently the top of the PDMS to facilitate bonding. Be careful, pressing down the patterns could collapse them.Put a piece of tape on top of the chip to prevent dust from bonding to the chip.Bake the bonded device at 65 °C for 1 h or overnight to cure the bonding.Inject 10 µl of filter sterilized 1% Pluronic F-127 dissolved in distilled water and wait for 30 min at room temperature to passivate interior surfaces. Be careful, before injecting the liquid into the channel with a pipette, pour a drop of liquid onto the inlet to prevent bubbles entering the channel.Flush the channel with sterile distilled water or SC media to remove Pluronic F-127. Be careful again not to inject bubbles into the channel. Pour a drop of liquid onto the inlet first.The microfluidic chip is now ready to be loaded with yeast.Cell culturing and loadingPreculture yeast cells overnight the day before the experiment in 5 ml of synthetic complete (SC) medium containing 2% w/vol glucose in a shaking incubator at 30 °C.On the day of the experiment dilute cells 50-fold into 50 ml of SC + 2% w/vol glucose.Culture them for 5-6 h in a shaking incubator at 30 °C until they reach and OD600 of 0.2-0.4.Put 1 ml of cells in 1.",
    "5 ml Eppendorf tube and centrifuge them for 1 min at RCF of 300 x g.Resuspend the cells in 20 µl SC media + 2% w/vol glucose.Load 10 µl of resuspended cells into the channel with a pipette. To make sure that no bubbles get in, pour a drop of liquid onto the inlet first and then load the cells.Tape the chip on a custom made 3D printed holder (Figure 3) with cell chambers facing outwards, so that the centrifugal force can push the cells from media channel into the cell chamber. The chip must be firmly pressed against the holder and taped on one side as shown in Figure 3A. After taping the chip should be completely immobilized.Attach the 3D printed holder onto the Laurell  WS-650  spin coater and centrifuge for 2 min at 110 x g.Alternatively, tape the chip into a centrifuge making sure that the forces push cells into the cell chambers.Check under a microscope that cells have been loaded into the cell chambers. Usually, a couple of layers of cells are pushed inside towards the dead end (point furthest away from media channel) of the cell chamber.Flush the remaining cells out of the media channel with SC media + 2% w/vol glucose, making sure that no bubbles enter the system. To prevent bubbles from entering, pour a drop of liquid onto the inlet first and then flush the cells. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200701/20200701084202_3710.jpgFigure 3.

    "Media perfusion and imagingThere are several options to perfuse media in microfluidic chips using hydrostatic pressure, peristaltic pumps, syringe pumps, or pressure based pumps. We opted for pressure-based pumps as they offer seamless control over flow of media through the system. The flow rate control module, assures constant media flow rate, no matter if there are clogs or bubbles in the system. These are often eliminated as the control system attempts to maintain the same flow rate in time.Turn on the microscope and heat it up to 30 °C.Prepare 50 ml of SC media with appropriate glucose concentration in 50 ml Falcon tube.Assemble the pressure-based microfluidic flow control system (MFCS, Fluigent) coupled with a flow rate platform (Fluigent) and a flow rate control module (Fluigent) according to the instructions provided with the system. See Figure 4 for details.Connect input and output tubing to the chip. Make sure that the media is flowing very slowly out of the tubing prior to and while connecting it to the chip to prevent bubbles entering the system.Set the flow in All-in-One (A-i-O, Fluigent) software to maximum to flush out all the remaining cells from the nutrient channel and then set the flow to constant 5 µl/min.Keep the output at a constant pressure of 100 mbar above atmospheric pressure to minimize formation of air bubbles inside the nutrient channel.Inspect the chip for potential leaks before mounting it to the microscope.Place the chip onto the microscope stage and fix it in place with tape.Set up the image acquisition parameters relevant to your experiments. Ideally, image as many positions as possible at the lowest intensity and exposure as possible and at shortest time intervals as possible. If you want to observe a set of several complete cell chambers in one frame, use 10x objective.",
    "If you want to observe details at the single cell level, use 60x or 100x oil-immersed objective. Duration of a typical experiment is 24-72 h. However, we did manage to run experiments for up to one week without major disruptions.Check the first few intervals of imaging to make sure that the focus is stable and that the field is not drifting.Check occasionally that no clogs or leaks are impeding the ongoing experiment. Clogs mainly occur if bubbles are formed in the system and leaks mainly occur if inlet or outlet is cracked.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200701/20200701084222_4969.jpgFigure 4. Microfluidic device setup. A. Media reservoirs are pressurized with Fluigent MFCS pressure pump resulting in flow through the flow sensors, into the chip and then to waste. Flow sensors and pressure pump are connected to the flow-rate control module, which maintains a constant flow through the system. Nutrient supply and media conditions can be changed in real time. B.
