    "The experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad de la República, Montevideo, Uruguay.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65493/65493fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Workflow for high-resolution respirometry to assess mitochondrial function in intact and permeabilized human sperm. The protocol was divided into four different steps: 1) preparation of the sample, 2) oxygen calibration in the Oroboros instrument, 3) oxygen consumption measurement for intact and permeabilized cells, and 4) data extraction from the equipment and analysis. Abbreviations: CASA = computer-assisted sperm analysis; BWW = Biggers Whitten Whittingham medium; MRM = mitochondrial respiration medium; ADP = adenosine diphosphate; FCCP = carbonyl cyanide -p- trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; AA = antimycin A.

Information on the materials, equipment, and reagents used in the protocol is presented in the Table of Materials.\n1. Sample preparation\nSample collection\n\t\nCollect freshly ejaculated human semen by masturbation after a recommended 3 day abstinence in a sterile plastic container. Transport the samples immediately to the laboratory.\nIncubate the samples for 30-60 min at room temperature (RT) to liquefy completely24.\nAfter liquefaction, store the samples at 37 °C until the experiment begins.\nSperm evaluation with computer-aided sperm analysis (CASA)\n\t\nMix the sample, and load 7 µL into a pre-warmed sperm counting chamber.\nPlace the chamber on the pre-warmed (37 °C) stage of a direct light microscope.\nOpen the computerized sperm analysis software and, enter the motility and concentration module (click on Mot).\nSelect the configuration that corresponds to human sperm conditions.\n\t\tNOTE: The configuration must be adapted to the type and depth of the chamber as well as to the sample species and the system CASA.",
    "Randomly analyze 10 different fields per chamber by clicking on the Analyze button.\nClick on Results to obtain the sample concentration and motility.\nCell preparation\n\tNOTE: If the HRR is not calibrated, start with steps 2.1-2.2 before preparing the cells (step 1.3). It is important to measure the oxygen consumption immediately when the sperm cells are resuspended in the medium.\n\t\nCentrifuge the samples at 400 x g for 10 min at RT.\nRemove the seminal plasma, and resuspend the spermatozoa in 2 mL of Biggers Whitten Whittingham (BWW) for experiments with intact cells or mitochondrial respiration medium (MRM) for studies with permeabilized cells. The compositions of the media are shown in Table 1.\nRepeat the steps described in step 1.2 for sperm concentration studies.\n2. High-resolution respirometry: OXPHOS analysis\nNOTE: HRR integrates highly sensitive oxygraphs (Oxygraph-2 K; Oroboros Instruments GmbH, Innsbruck, Austria) with software (DatLab, version 4.2; Oroboros Instruments GmbH). The experimental data are displayed as the oxygen concentration versus time (as pmol of O2/106 cells·min−1) and as real-time transformations of these data, allowing the experimenter to track the respiration (oxygen consumption, oxygen flux) of biological and biochemical samples while the experiment is still running. The HRR can be used to follow the respiration of living and motile cells, which is particularly useful for sperm, whose motility is associated with the sperm quality and fertility potential. The laboratory uses an HRR Oroboros Oxygraph2-k, Oroboros Instruments, with two chambers. The steps described in this protocol must be performed independently for both 2 mL chambers.\nEquipment preparation\n\t\nTurn on the HRR, and connect it to the respirometry software (DatLab) for data acquisition and analysis.",
    "Replace the 70% ethanol in the oxygraph chamber with ddH2O. Stir it continuously with the magnetic stir bar in the chamber at 750 rpm. Let it stand for 10 min, and aspirate the double-distilled (dd) H2O afterward.\nWash the chamber three times with ddH2O for 5 min each time.\n\t\tNOTE: This step is necessary to remove the remaining ethanol from the chambers. Sperm cells are very sensitive to ethanol. The recording could be compromised if this step is omitted.\nCalibration of the oxygen sensors\n\tNOTE: The calibration procedure varies slightly depending on the instrument. Perform an air calibration of the polarographic oxygen sensor as described by the manufacturer25. In this section, the calibration protocol is explained briefly.\n\t\nRemove the ddH2O, and pipette 2 mL of the same medium used for the cell preparation into the chamber. Place the stoppers, leaving an air exchange bubble.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important to know the volume of the chamber to determine the exact volume of medium needed.\nRecord the oxygen calibration values (click on Layout > 01 Calibration Exp. Gr3-Temp) to monitor the performance of the sensor membrane by stirring the medium with the stir bar at 750 rpm for at least 30 min at 37 °C. Use the other settings as mentioned: gain for sensor: 2; polarization voltage: 800 mV; data recording interval: 2.0 s.\n\t\t​NOTE: It is expected to obtain an O2 slope uncorrected (red line) within ±2 pmol∙s−1∙mL−1 with a stable signal from the polarographic sensor.\nDrag the mouse while holding down the left mouse button and the shift key to select an area where the change in oxygen concentration (Y1 O2 Concentration, blue line) is stable.",
    "Open the O2 Calibration window (click on Oxygraph > O2 Calibration). In Air Calibration, change the selected mark to the region selected in step 2.2.3. Finish by clicking on Calibrate and Copy to Clipboard.\nStop the recording, and save by clicking on Oxygraph > Ok Control > Save and Disconnect.\n\t\tNOTE: This dataset must be saved so that it can be used in all of the day's experiments. The calibration is only performed once per day for each medium.\nDigitonin-permeabilization titration\n\t\nOpen the chamber, and aspirate the medium inside.\nLoad in the chamber at least 24 x 106 and no more than 70 x 106 sperm cells in a final volume of 2 mL of MRM.\n\t\t​NOTE: It is important to measure the number of cells in the chamber in order to adjust the oxygen consumption at the end of the experiment. A lower number of cells than recommended cannot be measured.\nClose the chamber by pushing the stoppers all the way in, and aspirate the remaining liquid at the top. Start the experiment with the same settings as for the calibration: stirring speed: 750 rpm; temperature: 37 °C; gain for sensor: 2; polarization voltage: 800 mV; and data recording interval: 2.0 s.\nTo load the calibration, double-click on the Pos Calib box in the bottom corner. Open the calibration performed in step 2.2 (click on Oxygraph > O2 Calibration > Copy from File), and click on Calibrate and Copy to Clipboard.\n\t\tNOTE: The POS Calib box will change from yellow to green. The data are displayed in oxygen flow corrected per volume charts (Layout 05 Flux per Volume uncorrected). Different layouts are available in Oxygraph > Layout.",
    "Add 5 µL of 0.5 M adenosine diphosphate (ADP), 10 µL of 2 M glutamate, and 2.5 µL of 0.4 M malate (final concentrations: 1.25 mM, 10 mM, and 0.5 mM). Measure the oxygen consumption until the signal stabilizes.\n\t\tNOTE: Precision Hamilton micro-syringes are used for injection through the loading port in the stopper. Use one syringe per drug to avoid cross-contamination. Click on F4 to register, and mark in the oxygen register when a treatment is added.\n\t\tNOTE: The substrates are prepared in ultrapure water and stored at −20 °C for 3 months.\nTritate by adding 1 µL of 10 mM digitonin in successive steps until the oxygen consumption reaches a maximal level.\n\t\tNOTE: Thorough washing with water, 70% ethanol, and 100% ethanol is essential if the same chamber is used for two experiments on the same day.\n\t\tNOTE: Digitonin is prepared in ultrapure water and stored at −20 °C for 3 months.\nRoutine respiratory assessment protocol for intact and permeabilized sperm cells (complex I or complex II)\n\t\nOpen the chamber, and aspirate the medium inside.\nLoad in the chamber at least 24 x 106 and no more than 70 x 106 sperm cells in a final volume of 2 mL of BWW (intact cell analysis) or MRM (permeabilized cell analysis).\nStart the experiment with the same settings as for the calibration (this is described in step 2.3.3).\nLoad the calibration performed in step 2.2 as described in step 2.3.4.\nRecord the respiration of the cells for at least 5 min until a stable signal is obtained. This measurement corresponds to basal respiration in intact cells.\nIf the experiment is with intact cells, proceed to step 2.4.9. For permeabilized cells, inject 4.5 µL of 10 mM digitonin (final concentration: 22.5 µM). Permeabilize the cells for 5 min.",
    "Add the substrates: 10 µL of 2 M glutamate and 2.5 µL of 0.4 M malate (final concentrations: 10 mM and 0.5 mM, respectively) for complex I or 20 µL of 1 M succinate (final concentration: 10 mM) for complex II. Measure the oxygen consumption until the signal increases and stabilizes. This is state 4, which means basal complex I or basal complex II supported respiration in the absence of ADP.\n\t\tNOTE: The substrates are prepared in ultrapure water and stored at −20 °C for 3 months.\nInject 5 µL of 0.5 M ADP (final concentration: 1.25 mM). Measure the oxygen consumption until the signal increases and stabilizes. The addition of ADP increases the signal corresponding to the maximum oxygen consumption through complex I or complex II (state 3, in permeabilized cells).\nAdd 1 µL of 4 mg/mL oligomycin (final concentration: 2 µg/mL), an ATP synthetase inhibitor. Measure the oxygen consumption until the signal decreases and stabilizes.\n\t\tNOTE: Oligomycin is prepared in ethanol and stored at −20 °C for 3 months.\nTitrate by adding 1 µL of 0.1 mM to 1 mM carbonyl cyanide-P- trifluoromethoxy-phenylhydrazone (FCCP) in successive steps until a maximum uncoupled respiration rate is reached. Measure the oxygen consumption until the signal increases and stabilizes.\n\t\tNOTE: FCCP is prepared in ethanol and stored at −20 °C for 3 months.\nThe final concentration of FCCP is sample-dependent. Stop injecting the drug when oxygen consumption begins to decrease.",
    "Finally, inject 1 µL of 5 mM antimycin A (2.5 µM final concentration). This is a complex III inhibitor to discriminate between the mitochondrial and residual oxygen consumption (non-mitochondrial respiration). For the analysis of complex I, add 1 µL of 1 mM rotenone (0.5 µM final concentration), an inhibitor of this complex, instead of AA. Measure the oxygen consumption until the signal decreases and stabilizes.\n\t\t​NOTE: The drugs are prepared in ethanol and stored at −20 °C for 3 months.\n3. Data extraction and analysis\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65493/65493fig2v2.jpg\nFigure 2: Acquisition of respiratory parameters from a high-resolution respirometry experiment. (A,B) Schematic representations of graphs obtained, as described in Figure 1, for intact and permeabilized cells, respectively. These parameters have been previously described15. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65493/65493fig2v2large.jpg]\nDrag the mouse by pressing the left mouse button and the shift key to select regions where the oxygen flux per volume correlated (Y2 O2 slope uncorr., red line) is stable after the injection of a substrate or inhibitor. Figure 2 shows the different parameters obtained from the register previously described15.\n\tNOTE: The parameters depend on the experiment; all of them are as follows: basal respiration in intact cells and respiration in the presence of glutamate/malate or succinate (state 4), ADP (state 3), oligomycin (proton leak), FCCP (maximum respiration rate), rotenone/AA (non-mitochondrial respiration). In permeabilized cells, basal respiration corresponds to state 3.\nClick on the Marks > Statistics windows, and export the data.\nNormalize the data obtained per 1 million sperm cells. The units of the slopes are pmolO2·s−1·mL−1·10−6 cells.\nSubtract the non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption from all the values before calculating the indices.\nCalculate the indices using the various equations previously described15:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65493/65493eq01v3.jpg\nSubscription Required.
