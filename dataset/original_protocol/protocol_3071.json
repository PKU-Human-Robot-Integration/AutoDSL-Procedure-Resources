    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPrerequisites for initiation of branching ICO culture\nTiming: 2 h\nThis section of the protocol describes the preparations needed prior to ICO branching initiation.\nPrepare a fresh batch of serum-free EM and BM as described in the EM and BM recipe table.\nFilter the media using a 0.22 μm filter.\nStore the media at 4°C for a maximum of one week, and pre-warm the media in a 37°C water bath prior to use for approximately 30 min.\nEstablish and maintain the in vitro ICO culture.\nMaintain an ICO culture within its log expansion growth phase, which has been passaged at least three times after tissue-derived initiation or at least two times after thawing.\nThe ICO should be cultured in EM, and should not exceed passage number 9.\nNote: An ICO culture that has reached its log expansion growth phase requires passaging at least once a week with a 1:2 or 1:4 ratio, showing a >80% density one week after passaging (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H). A large variety in organoid sizes can be observed, ranging from Ø 10‒1,000 μm. In addition, the level of debris or dying single cell clumps should not exceed an approximate estimation of 10%.\nNote: The branching ability of an ICO line can only be determined after branching initiation has been completed. Unfortunately, 30% of ICO will not result in any branching structures and will maintain a cystic organoid growth. Previous research did not identify any underlying patient characteristics that could predict branching development, such as donor age, sex or liver disease, making selection of successful ICO lines beforehand impossible.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nICO branching initiation into BRCO\nTiming: 3 days",
    "This part of the procedure describes the initiation of BRCO culture in already established ICO cultures, which will result in the establishment of a mixture of both cystic and branching ICO structures which differs per ICO line.\nBRCO initiation.\nMaintain ADV+++ and BME at 4°C and pre-warm the filtered EM at 37°C.\nCritical: Maintain ADV+++ at 4°C to enable collection of ICO from the BME. BME will turn to a more liquid state upon ice-cold temperatures, exceeding this temperature will result in BME solidifying during the process and greatly hampering successful ICO harvesting and seeding.\nSeed ICO at low density (20–50%) into two wells of a 12-well suspension plate, directly including a control well (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2815-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

The blue squared box tracks the branching formation of one of the BRCO over 2 weeks’ time. This specific ICO line already showed clear small tubular branching structures (Ø 100–500 μm) after 2 weeks of BM refreshment, while the EM control maintained exponential growth and required passaging after 1 week.\n(E) Tracking the outgrowth of branching structures until 1.5 weeks after manual BRCO clone selection, showing the formation of tubular structures after careful structure breaking during picking (blue squared box).",
    "(F) The 6 day outgrowth of BRCO after normal passaging procedures for the expansion of BRCO up to 1,000 μm (zoomed scale bar indicated 1,000 μm at 4× magnification), these results have been published as supplementary data in Roos et al., 2022; Supplementary figure S11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] (All images, except for A and zoom in: 2× magnification; scale bar indicates 2,000 μm).\nHarvest 1 well of a 12-well suspension plate with a >80% dense ICO culture, ranging from Ø 10‒1,000 μm in individual organoid sizes (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H).\nRemove culture medium from the well.\nAdd 900 μL ice-cold ADV+++ to the well, and collect the ICO by scraping the pipet tip across the bottom of the well and simultaneous resuspension.\nTransfer the collected ICO into a 15 mL tube and add approximately 9 mL of ADV+++.\nNote: Directly apply the desired splitting ratio to ultimately obtain a 20%–50% seeding, by removing part of the ICO suspension (f.e. with a 1:6 splitting ratio, remove 7 mL of the ICO suspension and add an additional 7 mL of fresh ADV+++).\nNote: The ratio (1:3, 1:4, 1:6 or sometimes even 1:8) in which a culture needs to be passaged to reach a 20%–50% seeding density, might differ greatly between different ICO lines. Previous culture experience should be used to estimate the correct splitting and seeding ratio. Try to avoid making the organoids into a single cell suspension, as this will hamper the success rate of branching initiation tremendously. It is therefore not advised to count the cells in order to define the seeding density (refer to troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] or 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], when higher or lower seeding densities were applied).\nDiverse the ICO from the medium and remaining BME by centrifugation at 453 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant without disturbing the ICO pellet.",
    "Resuspend the ICO pellet in 200 μL ice-cold ADV+++.\nMechanically break the organoid structures into smaller fragments by vigorously resuspending, approximately 20 times using a P200 tip, against the bottom of the tube.\nNote: Upon breaking, organoids should maintain an approximate small-middle size range of Ø 10–500 μm. Based on the approximate size of harvesting, the force of resuspension should be determined. Elongate the resuspension time when organoid sizes exceed Ø >600 μm, to obtain the approximate size for branching initiation. Pay attention to avoid a single cell solution, and do not exceed resuspension times over 5 min, to prevent any harmful effects on the ICO culture.\nAdd an additional 2–3 mL ice-cold ADV+++ and collect the ICO by centrifugation at 453 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nCarefully remove supernatant, using either a vacuum system or pipetting, and dry the pellet as much as possible by utilizing a P200 to remove the residual ADV+++. Thereby further avoiding BME dilution in the next step.\nNote: Since ICO growth speeds rapidly decrease upon branching initiation, it is strongly advised to remove the supernatant as much as possible before adding the BME to the ICO pellet. This will result in a sturdy BME dome that will last the first few weeks of branching initiation. Consequently, preventing any unnecessary and untimely passaging of fragile branching structures due to degrading BME. In addition, ICO are more prone to initiate branching structures in a sturdier environment.\nCarefully resuspend the dried pellet into 150 μL ice-cold BME to avoid bubbles.\nDivide the ICO into 2 wells of a 12-well suspension plate by adding three 25 μL BME domes in each well in the shape of a triangle (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).",
    "Note: To simplify the manual BRCO clone picking procedure in advance, seed the ICO into the corner wells of the 12-well plate.\nIncubate the plate for 3 min at 21°C–25°C, and flip the plate upside down in one smooth motion.\nIncubate the plate upside down for 45 min at 37°C.\nNote: Flip the plate upside down in a smooth motion to ensure the distribution of the ICO through the complete BME dome. Otherwise, the ICO will sink towards the well-bottom within the BME dome, thereby limiting environmental growth space in 3D and potentially promoting well-bottom adhesion of the ICO towards a 2D outgrowth.\nReverse the plate and add 1 mL pre-warmed EM for the first 3 days of culture (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: Gently add the EM against the sides of the well to prevent any disturbance of the BME domes.\nNote: Recovery of the ICO with EM after seeding is highly recommended to increase the success rate of the branching formation (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C).\nAfter 3 days, switch the EM by removing the old media and adding 1 mL fresh 37°C pre-warmed and filtered BM for one of the wells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). Continue culture with EM for the other well as a control of viable ICO growth after seeding.\nNote: The inclusion of the EM control will elucidate whether ICO culture would still maintain after seeding, or whether a technical error has occurred which could explain the lack of branching structures in advance (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nMaintenance of (starting) BRCO culture\nTiming: 3–8 weeks",
    "The estimated time for the formation of branching structures highly differs between different ICO lines. Some ICO lines might already show starting branching structures within one week after the BM switch, while other ICO lines might take up to one month before the first branches are forming. This section of the procedure will elaborate the protocol for the maintenance of initiated BRCO culture.\nIn vitro BRCO maintenance.\nCheck BRCO for (starting) branching structures and refresh medium by removing the old media and adding 1 mL fresh pre-warmed 37°C BM every 2–3 days (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nCulture the EM control as performed normally based on 80% density and organoid size (Ø 10‒1,000 μm), passaging the culture when required (see before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nNote: Although this part of the procedure might already take up to 3–4 weeks before the ICO initiated branching structures, the EM control ICO will restore its original growth speed, rapidly preceding the BM culture (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D). Consequently, the EM control needs to be passaged more frequently. Especially, since growth speed rapidly decreases upon culture in BM.\nPassage the BRCO when a density of >95% BME occupation is reached, or when the BME domes start to degrade and detach from the well bottom by applying a similar procedure as described for initial seeding (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E and 2F).",
    "Note: At the initiation stage within the procedure, a culture comprising solely of darkened cystic ICO could still be observed (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D; blue squared box). In some cases, only 2–3 tiny (Ø 10–100 μm) starting branching structures can be distinguished (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D; blue squared box). In which the cystic organoids will expand in size more rapidly compared to the branching structures. Passaging is only performed to enable a sturdier BME environment, to generate more space for structural outgrowth, or to break any cystic ICO with size exceeding Ø 500 μm. In addition, passaging of starting BCRO could be an option when original seeding was deemed too high (refer to troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] or 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]). Once a pure BRCO has been established, passaging can be applied to further expand the BRCO culture for future experimental assays or viable stock freezing.\nHarvest the organoids by removing the culture media\nGently suspend the BME domes in 900 μL of ADV+++ while scraping across the bottom of the well.\nNote: Branching organoids can be broken into smaller fragments (Ø 10–500 μm), however it is strongly recommended to apply gentle resuspension techniques within the well plate. Subsequently breaking the larger sized cystic organoids (Ø 300‒1,000 μm), while maintaining the branching structures (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nTransfer the harvested organoids into a 15 mL tube and fill up the suspension towards 10 mL of ADV+++.\nCentrifuge the organoid suspension at 453 g for 5 min at 4°C and remove supernatant.\nNote: Centrifuge the harvested organoids only once to prevent the loss and excessive breaking of any small branching structures.\nDry the pellet as much as possible by applying a P200, removing any residual supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in the appropriate amount of BME to passage the culture 1:1 or 1:2 by adding 75 μL or 150 μL respectively.",
    "Prepare one or two wells of a 12-well suspension plate with each 3 domes of 25 μL.\nIncubate the plate for 3 min at 21°C–25°C, and subsequently flip the plate upside down in one smooth motion.\nIncubate the plate for 45 min at 37°C.\nNote: Flip the plate upside down in a smooth motion to ensure the distribution of the ICO through the complete BME dome. Otherwise, the ICO will sink towards the well-bottom within the BME dome, thereby limiting environmental growth space in 3D and potentially promoting well-bottom adhesion of the ICO towards a 2D outgrowth.\nReverse the plate an add 1 mL of pre-warmed BM.\nNote: Gently add the BM against the sides of the well to prevent any disturbance of the BME domes.\nContinue with checking the BRCO cultures every 2–3 days to determine the mode of action in refreshing medium for 1 mL 37°C pre-warmed BM or passaging.\nNote: Upon passaging, it can take up to 5–7 days before true branching structures are observed again. Unfortunately, some lines lose the ability to form branching structures after passaging, showing only cystic ICO after 2–3 weeks of culture (refer to troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]). This shift in phenotype towards cystic organoids could be caused by technical difficulties during procedure handling. However, in some cases this shift presents due to yet uncovered underlying mechanisms. Currently, the specific rationale for this shift, either procedure handling or underlying mechanisms, is not distinguishable. Once again stressing the importance of a correct decision whether to passage or continue refreshing the medium. In this case, the rule of thumb would be to rather refresh the medium once too many, than to passage the line too early and risking the loss of potential branching structures.\nManual BRCO clone picking (optional step)\nTiming: 2 h",
    "This part of the procedure is of special importance for initiated BRCO that maintain to present an elaborate mixture of both cystic ICO and small to middle sized BRCO (Ø 100–500 μm). The manual selection of these BRCO will not only purify the culture all together, yet it will also enable a more spatial environment to stimulate BRCO outgrowth into large, complicated branching structures of approximately Ø 2,000 μm. This section of the protocol will display a detailed description on the handling procedures for selective manual BRCO picking.\nNote: This section of the protocol is only applicable for BRCO cultures that either include non-branching, cystic ICOs or contains multiple smaller BRCO (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). The manual selection of BRCO will enable a pure BRCO culture or the opportunity to promote outgrowth of larger BRCO. Some BRCO will develop a pure branching culture with large intrinsic tubular networks directly after initiation, these BRCO only require culture maintenance, as described in the section Maintenance of (starting) BRCO cultures.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2815-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. The manual clone selection of BRCO to enable the outgrowth of larger BRCO structures and the purification of the BRCO culture from cystic ICO structures\n(A) The BRCO density (<70%) without overlapping structures that could be picked by applying an inverted microscope, as indicated by the example in the picture.\n(B) The manual BRCO selection of high density BRCO cultures (>70%) with overlapping structures utilizing an automated hybrid microscope cell imaging system (EVOS Cell Imaging System, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The blue arrows indicate the BRCO structures that should be manually picked. (All bright field images; 2× magnification; scale bar indicates 2,000 μm).",
    "Note: Passaging of a pure BRCO culture might result in the recurrence of cystic ICO counterparts, meaning that some lines require multiple rounds of manual clone picking to restore a pure BRCO after every passage (refer to troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nNote: Somewhat degraded BME can simplify the picking procedure since it enables the piercing and separation of the BME more easily and therefore the selective collection of branching structure.\nBRCO selection.\nAdd 9 mL ice-cold ADV+++ into a 15 mL tube, and preserve on ice within an ice-bucket until required.\nNote: Keep this tube on ice during the complete procedure. None of the handling described requires to take the tube from the ice-bucket.\nManual selection of BRCO is performed by picking the branching structures from the BME dome using a bright field microscope, leaving the cystic ICO behind in the BME dome. Two different techniques for manual selection can be applied, based on the overall density and spatial distribution of the culture of interest.\nApply the correct selective BRCO picking strategy and continue the procedure accordingly.\nManual BRCO clone picking with an inverted microscope upon lower quantity (<70%), non-overlapping, mixed BRCO cultures (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nNote: When there is enough space between the cystic ICO and BRCO, without any overlapping structures (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A), clone picking can be performed by utilizing an inverted bright field microscope.\nWipe all required materials, microscope and bench with 70% Ethanol, especially when working outside of the flow-cabinet.\nDirectly place the ice-bucket containing the 15 mL with ADV+++ next to the microscope system.\nDo not remove the BM culture medium prior to manual picking.\nMicroscopically check the location of the desired BRCO clone for manual picking at the 4× and 10× magnification. Use the 10× magnification for further picking.",
    "Use a P200 or P1000, based on the preferential BRCO size and prevention of BRCO network breaking, to selectively pick the clone of interest (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A; blue arrows). Set pipets to 100 μL.\nTake approximately 20–50 μL of ice-cold ADV+++ from the 15 mL tube, into the P200 tip. Keep fluids at the apex of the P200 tip.\nFind the pipet tip underneath the microscope and bring in close proximity of the BRCO of interest.\nPierce the BME carefully and allocate the tip as close as possible to the BRCO of interest.\nGently eject the 20–50 μL into the BME, as close to the BRCO of interest as possible, to locally liquefy the BME.\nGently suck the complete branching structure into the P200 tip, prevent the inclusion of any cystic ICO (refer to troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nTransfer the BRCO into the 15 mL containing the ice-cold ADV+++, and resuspend approximately 5–7 times to remove the branching structure from the pipet tip (refer to troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nRepeat cycle from step 5.C.VI until all BRCO of interest have been harvested (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nDiscard the plate containing the residual cystic ICO culture.\nContinue with step 5.E.\nManual BRCO clone picking with the automated hybrid microscope cell imaging system (EVOS) upon high quantity (>70%), overlapping and mixed BRCO cultures (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).",
    "Note: A highly dense culture of >70% BME occupation that contains overlapping structures of cystic ICO and BRCO or even clumped cystic ICO and BRCO structures, hampers selective clone picking without the inclusion of any cystic ICO. In this case, manual clone picking can be performed by using an automated hybrid microscope system (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). Consequently, creating more space to manipulate the pipet upon picking and applying a lower magnification that can visualize the complete well all at once, which both benefit manual clone picking in high density cultures tremendously.\nWipe all required materials, microscope and bench with 70% Ethanol, especially when working outside of the flow-cabinet.\nDirectly place the ice-bucket containing the 15 mL with ADV+++ next to the EVOS system.\nRemove the BM culture medium prior to manual picking.\nAdd 1 mL of ice-cold ADV+++ from the 15 mL tube directly to the well of interest.\nDissolve the BME domes by gentle resuspension and scraping as normally performed during passaging.\nNote: Make sure to only gently resuspend the BME domes, to prevent any unnecessary breaking of the branching structures.\nAdd an additional 1 mL of ice-cold ADV+++ from the 15 mL tube, and mix the BRCO suspension.\nNote: The BRCO suspension should increase the space among cystic and branching ICO structures, thereby reducing the amount of overlap.\nUtilize the EVOS system to visualize the mixed BRCO suspension.\nSelectively pick branching structures from the BRCO suspension using a P200 pipet and tip, prevent the inclusion of any cystic ICO (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B; blue arrows) (refer to troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nTransfer any collect branching structures directly to the 15 mL tube, and resuspend approximately 5–7 times to remove the branching structure from the pipet tip (refer to troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).",
    "Repeat cycle from step 5.D.VIII until all BRCO of interest have been harvested (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nDiscard the plate containing the residual cystic ICO culture.\nContinue with step 5.E.\nPassage the manually picked BRCO clones obtained via inverted microscopy or the EVOS system, continuing with the 15 mL tube containing ice-cold ADV+++ and the selected BRCO.\nCentrifuge the manually picked BRCO suspension at 453 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant, and dry the pellet as much as possible by removing any residual supernatant using a P200.\nAdd the desired amount of BME to the pellet, to constitute the same number of wells of a 12-well suspension plate as the picking procedure started with. Continue to apply three 25 μL domes per 12-well in a triangle shape (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nNote: Apply a 1:1 passaging rate after manual BRCO clone picking, since this a stressful procedure and some branching structure might be lost during handling (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nIncubate the plate for 3 min at 21°C–25°C, and subsequently flip the plate upside down in one smooth motion.\nIncubate the plate for 45 min at 37°C.\nNote: Flip the plate upside down in a smooth motion to ensure the distribution of the ICO through the complete BME dome. Otherwise, the ICO will sink towards the well-bottom within the BME dome, thereby limiting environmental growth space in 3D and potentially promoting well-bottom adhesion of the ICO towards a 2D outgrowth.\nReverse the plate and add 1 mL of pre-warmed BM. Gently add the BM against the sides of the well to prevent any disturbance of the BME domes.\nContinue with checking the BRCO cultures every 2–3 days to determine the mode of action in refreshing medium for 1 mL 37°C pre-warmed BM or passaging (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E and 2F).",
    "Note: The most optimal (sterile) setting would be to place a microscope in the flow-cabinet, preventing any potential bacterial and fungal contamination. However, when not available, manual BRCO clone selection can be performed outside of the flow-cabinet at the bench, after extensive cleaning with 70% Ethanol of all required materials. Make sure to keep an eye out for potential microbial contamination when using the latter option.\nNote: Wear gloves during the complete clone picking procedure (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nNote: Use sterile P200 pipet tips, even when working outside of the flow-cabinet, preventing any additional contamination sources. Do not utilize these tips within the flow-cabinet after non-sterile use. However, these tips can still be applied for non-sterile bench procedures.\nCritical: To maintain a pure BRCO culture, a mixture of selective clonal picking and passaging needs to be applied.\nBRCO viable frozen storage and validation experiments\nTiming: Highly depends on desired experimental design\nOnce a pure BRCO culture has been established, the branching structures will reach extensive sizes with elaborate networks of tubular structures (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). The maintenance and expansion of these BRCO lines highly depends on their future application in experimental assays and/or frozen storage. This section of the procedure elucidates the procedures for viable frozen storages and provides ideas for further validation experiments.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2815-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "(B) Upon BM media switch, the percentage of BRCO outgrow differs between different healthy ICO lines, ranging from 70%‒25% of total organoid structures within the BME dome including different size ranges of (100–500 μm), these results have been published as supplementary data in Roos et al., 2022; Supplementary figure S1.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\n(C) Successful branching of BRCCAO, showing the distinct dense branching structures without large elaborate networks or tubular formations reaching outwards (zoomed scale bar indicates 1,000 μm at 4× magnification).\n(D) The successful branching of PCLDO showing large elaborate tubular networks exceeding the 3,000 μm (zoomed scale bar indicates 1,000 μm at 4× magnification). (All images, except zoom in; 2× magnification; scale bar indicates 2,000 μm).\nViable frozen stock storage and validation experiments.\nViable freezing of BRCO cultures is highly comparable to ICO viable freezing.\nThaw a CoolCell cryo-container at 4°C for approximately 30 min, and maintain at 4°C until storage at −80°C.\nThaw frozen FM on ice for approximately 15 min, and maintain on ice during the procedure.\nPrint labels or pre-write the cryovials prior to starting the freezing procedure.\nHarvest BRCO cultures by removing the culture medium, and gently resuspend the BME domes into 900 μL ice-cold ADV+++ by scraping the well bottom.\nTransfer the collected BRCO into a 15 mL tube and fill-up to 10 mL with ice-cold ADV+++.\nCentrifuge the BRCO at 453 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL ice-cold FM with a 5 mL serological pipet and pipetboy combination.\nGently pipet a few times up and down until the pellet is completely dissolved, while small fragments are still visible within the suspension.",
    "Add the required amount of FM to enable the freezing of one well of a 12-well suspension plate into one cryovial with a total volume of 1 mL respectively.\nDivide the BRCO FM into the required amount of cryovials, and store the cryovials into a 4°C CoolCell cryo-container by equally dividing the cryovials over the available locations within the cryo-container.\nWithin 5 min after FM addition, store the cryo-container containing the BRCO cryovials into a −80°C freezer for at least 2 h with a maximum of 24 h.\nFor long-term storage, transfer the cryovials to liquid nitrogen storage at −196°C, as soon as possible.\nNote: Since the BRCO pellet is not resuspended into BME, a completely dried pellet is not obligatory. Some residual supernatant is allowed upon resuspension into FM.\nNote: It is highly recommended to apply a 5 mL serological pipet rather than a P1000 upon pellet resuspension, to hamper any unnecessary breaking of the fragile branching structures upon viable freezing.\nAny further experimental assays highly depend on the research implementation of interest. BRCO lines should be expanded according to the described procedure until sufficient numbers for the further experimental assay have been reached.\nNote: Previous research of Roos et al. has extensively researched multiple applications for identification, differentiation, validation, and functionality experiments, such as: immunofluorescence whole mount imaging, time-lapse imaging, qRT-PCR, single-cell transcriptomic, Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry, FACS and branching tree network analysis, in both BRCO and BRCCAO.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] For an elaborate experimental design and procedures on assays, we refer to the extensive publication of Roos et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]"
