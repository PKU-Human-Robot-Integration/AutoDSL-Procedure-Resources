The vectors accompanying this protocol carry either Citrine, Cerulean or mCherry fluorescent reporters as well as one of 48 unique Nanotag sequences allowing multiplex testing of enhancers using Nanostring technology. The cloning insertion site contains the lacZ expression cassette flanked by asymmetric recognition sites for type IIS restriction enzyme BsmBI. Putative enhancers are amplified using primers extended by tails that contain the asymmetric BsmBI recognition site and specific cleavage sequences that will produce the sticky-end overhangs corresponding precisely to the ones remaining in the vector following BsmBI digestion. As a type IIS enzyme BsmBI cleaves outside its recognition sequence, the binding site is lost in both the vector and the amplified enhancer fragment following their ligation, precluding the re-digestion of the ligated constructs containing the intended fragment (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). As such the digestion-ligation reaction can be performed simultaneously in the same tube, using a modified GoldenGate assembly cycling reaction. During the digestion-ligation steps, the lacZ cassette is excised and the putative enhancer is inserted in a highly efficient fashion. Self-annealing of the vector does not occur as the overhangs generated by the excision of the lacZ cassette are not compatible. Positive colonies can then be easily identified by blue/white selection.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1312-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

We recommend Kapa LongRange and describe the conditions below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1312_1.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1312_2.csv\n∗Adjust according to primer Tm\nRun PCR samples on 1% agarose gel and gel purify. We used Promega Wizard SV gel and PCR clean-up system (A9282). Quantify on Nanodrop.\nPause point: purified PCR’s can be stored at −20°C.\nDigestion/Ligation reaction\nSet up digestion/ligation reaction as below in 0.2 mL PCR tubes.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1312_3.csv\nRun the digestion/ligation reaction in a thermal cycler\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1312_4.csv\nCritical: Be sure to select the correct fluorescent reporter vector corresponding to the primers used to generate PCR products. Use different Nanotag vectors for each enhancer to be tested by Nanostring.\nOptional: Plasmid safe treatment to remove linearized vector\nSet up the plasmid safe reaction as below\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1312_5.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1312_6.csv\nTransformation.\nPlasmidSafe™ or digestion/ligation reactions can be directly transformed into competent cells of your choice. We used DH10B.\nOptional: Colony Screening. This approach is only suitable for enhancers >500 bp, owing to the limited resolution of plasmid lysates by gel electrophoresis. Alternatively, colonies can be screened by PCR or constructs can be directly mini-prepped and checked by sequencing without a screening step.\nFor optimal results grow colonies to approximately 1 mm in diameter. Screen ∼6 colonies per putative enhancer.\nPrepare 1% agarose gel, do not cover with TAE buffer.",
    "Add 10 μL of Qiagen buffer P1 to each PCR tube or well of 96 plate to be used.\nUsing a sterile tip, touch selected colony, streak onto a new plate (multiple colonies can be streaked on a single plate marked out into a grid) and place tip in tube/well containing P1.\nResuspend cells in P1 by gently agitating tips.\nRemove tips.\nAdd 10 μL buffer P2 and seal tubes/plate and heat at 60°C for 15 min in a PCR cycler.\nAdd 5 μL of 6× gel loading buffer.\nLoad samples onto gel ‘dry’ i.e., add only enough TAE running buffer to reach the sides of the gel, buffer should not cover the gel surface as the reaction mix does not sink in the buffer. Run electrophoresis for 2–5 min until samples have entered the gel then more running buffer can be added.\nDiscriminate positive colonies by comparing to super-coiled ladder. Nanotag reporter vectors with lacZ are 5 kb.\nPrepare Endotoxin free preps of positive colonies. We used Qiagen EndoFree Maxi kit (#12362) or Omega BioTek EZNA Endofree plasmid mini prep II (VWR #D6950-02) and Sanger sequence using pTK Forward and pTK Reverse primers (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nPause point: Endotoxin-free preps can be stored at −20°C until enough are ready for electroporation.\nElectroporation of enhancer constructs into early chick embryos\nTiming: 2–6 h\nNanotagged putative enhancer preps are now ready to be pooled and electroporated into early chick embryos. Electroporated embryos are allowed to grow to the desired stage such that in vivo enhancer reporter activity can develop and be subsequently quantified using Nanostring nCounter system®. These same steps are then followed to electroporate combinations of 1-3 positive enhancers from the Nanostring screen driving different fluorophores and imaged to record specific spatial and temporal enhancer activity.",
    "Combine Nanotag plasmids containing putative enhancers.\nPlasmids with unique Nanotags should be combined at equal concentration (∼0.5 μg/μL), to a final concentration of 6 μg/μL in water (this is the maximum concentration chick embryos can reasonably tolerate), this equates to 10–12 plasmids including controls.\nWe provide a number of Nanotag reporter plasmids containing the FoxD3 neural crest enhancer (NC1) (Simoes-Costa et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) as positive control (Addgene #130570 - #130573). If this is not suitable, we have also made other tested chick enhancers available (Addgene #130574 - #130625). Some of these are more broadly active across chick embryonic tissues and stages, see (Williams et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]) for specific expression patterns. We also provide several Nanotag reporter plasmids containing a short non-specific sequence to be used as negative control (Addgene #130558 - #130568). All controls were generated in a variety of Nanotags to facilitate flexibility in the pooling.\nCritical: Ensure pooled plasmids contain unique Nanotags.\nAdd vegetable dye to visualize solution during electroporation.\nElectroporate pooled plasmids into early chick embryos. We describe this process in detail in the ‘Ex ovo electroporation of early chicken embryos’ protocol associated with (Williams et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nInject ∼1 μL pooled plasmid solution into the entire epiblast of HH4 (Hamburger and Hamilton, 1951[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) chick embryos.\nNote: At HH4, cells of ectodermal origin will be successfully transfected, if mesoderm or endoderm derivatives are targeted, electroporation should be performed at HH3, however this does impede survival so higher number of embryos should be used.\nElectroporate using platinum plate electrodes and settings 5V, 100 ms ON, 50 ms OFF for 5 pulses.\nGrow embryos on thin albumin at 37°C until desired stage is reached.\nDissect the tissue of interest.",
    "Note: Isolation of specific cells is not necessary at this screening stage, but using dissected tissue will enrich for cells likely to harbour enhancer activity and thus provide more robust readout. Using whole embryos may result in false negatives due to dilution of enhancer positive cells.\nNanoString assay\nTiming:\nRNA extraction = 30 min hands on plus 1 h Turbo DNase incubation\nNanostring sample preparation = 30 min\nNanostring nCounter Prep station = 2 h\nNanostring nCounter digital analyser = 4 h\nIn this step RNA is extracted from the embryonic tissue of interest and subsequently hybridized with Nanostring probes such that enhancer reporter activity can be quantified using Nanostring nCounter®.\nPrepare dissected tissue for RNA extraction.\nWe recommend Ambion RNAqueous™-micro total RNA isolation kit (AM1931).\nPlace dissected tissue directly into 100 μL lysis buffer, in a low-bind 1.5 mL tube, minimizing the amount of media added with tissue.\nKeep on ice for 15 min and vortex for 5 s intermittently.\nFlash freeze in liquid nitrogen and store at −80°C.\nPause point: Dissected tissue can be stored in lysis buffer at −80°C for up to 3 months.\nExtract RNA from dissected tissue\nFollow RNA extraction protocol. Elute RNA with 2× 10 μL EB from the kit.\nAdd 2 μL Turbo DNase (AM1907) to 20 μL of eluted RNA.\nIncubate at 37°C for 1 h.\nAdd 2 μL resuspended inactivation reagent (AM1931) to DNase reaction and flick to mix.\nIncubate at 20°C–24°C for 2 min, flicking after one minute to maintain solution.\nCentrifuge at 10,000 g for 1.5 min, remove supernatant into new DNase/RNase free low-binding tube, careful not to take any pelleted inactivation reagent.\nVerify the integrity of RNA using Agilent Bioanalyzer or Tapestation. Use 100 ng high quality (RIN >7) RNA for Nanostring analysis.",
    "Hybridize samples with Nanostring CodeSet according to the manufacturer’s protocol (MAN-10056-03_CodeSet_hybridization_Setup).\nLoad samples into the nCounter® prep station and subsequently run the chip on the digital analysis system following the manufacturer’s instructions (MANC0035_nCounter_Analysis_System_MAX_FLEX). This manual also provides details for extracting and processing data files.\nNote: Nanostring nCounter® output data provides a simple count of mRNA transcripts detected by the custom CodeSet (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). By incorporating positive and negative controls, active enhancer candidates can be resolved. Typically, positive controls recorded counts between 600–900 and negative control counts were below 10 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). We empirically determined that enhancers with a count above 100 drove fluorescent reporter activity in vivo. We found minimal variance between different Nanotag reporters containing the same enhancer.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1312-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Nanostring screening of putative enhancers\n(A) Nanotag transcripts are detected by a customized Nanostring codeset (Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1312-Mmc1.xlsx]), counts above 100 (in green, above dashed line) were determined to depict in vivo enhancer activity.\n(B) Negative control plasmids achieved Nanostring counts less than 100. In vivo background expression is observed in the posterior extra-embryonic region.\n(C) Enhancers with Nanostring count >100 are re-electroporated into early chick embryos at higher concentration such that fluorescence can be observed. Multiple enhancers carrying different fluorophores can be imaged in parallel, as shown for neural crest enhancers; NC1, NC2 and Sox10E2 (Betancur et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Simoes-Costa et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). Figure adapted and reprinted with permission from (Williams et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nElectroporate candidate enhancers individually, or in combination of different fluorophores, into early chick embryos as step 6, but at higher concentration (2 μg/μL per enhancer) record spatiotemporal enhancer activity by confocal microscopy."
