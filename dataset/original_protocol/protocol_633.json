  "procedures": [
    "**Part 1:  Thaw human blastocysts**\n**NOTE:** all steps \\(except for #1 and 2) in this part are performed in a derivation hood equipped with a stereomicroscope\n1. Remove the cryotube\\(s) containing the human embryos from the liquid nitrogen and briefly place the tube\\(s) in a 37°C water bath until the content is completely thawed \\(about 60-90 seconds)\n  **TIP:**  We recommend to process a maximum of 5 embryos in parallel at the same time\n**NOTE:**  For embryos stored in straws, please see the protocol in \"BOX 1\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4395/original/Box_1.docx?1459342939\n2. Spray the cryotube\\(s) with 70% ethanol and gently wipe it clean\n  3. Using a P1000, transfer the content of the cryotube\\(s) to an empty 60mm dish\n  **CAUTION:**  Handle the embryos very gently and carefully\n**IMPORTANT:**  Avoid creating bubbles\n**? TROUBLESHOOTING**\n4. Using a stereomicroscope, visually identify the embryos and transfer them into the well containing ETS1; incubate 5 minutes at room temperature\n  **IMPORTANT:** for each embryo transfer step, make sure to carry over the smallest amount of media possible; this can be easily achieved using a stripper pipette\n5. Transfer the embryos to ETS2; incubate 5 minutes at room temperature\n  6. Transfer the embryos to ETS3; incubate 7.5 minutes at room temperature\n  7. Transfer the embryos to Cryo-PBS; incubate 6 minutes at room temperature, then move the dish to a heated surface and incubate 4 minutes at 37°C\n  **IMPORTANT:**  Do not place the embryos in a CO2 incubator at this stage\n8. Visually inspect the embryos for presence or absence of zona pellucida\n  9. Depending on the presence of zona pellucida, two alternative protocol should be followed.\n  a. Embryos without zona pellucida can be directly transferred to a well of an ibiTreat µ-plate filled with pre-equilibrated IVC1",
    "**IMPORTANT:**  Make sure to carry over the smallest amount of cryo-PBS to avoid altering the nutrient concentration in the culturing media.  This can be easily achieved by using a stripper pipette or by transferring the embryos to a dish containing IVC1 before transferring them to the ibiTreat µ-plate.\nb. Embryos with zona pellucida can also be directly transferred to a well of an ibiTreat µ-plate filled with pre-equilibrated IVC1 to allow them to hatch on their own, however this might delay attachment and development.  We therefore recommend to remove the zona pellucida according to the following steps:\ni. Transfer one embryo into a droplet of AT solution\n**CAUTION:**  Unless the user has previous experience using AT to treat embryos, we recommend processing one embryo at a time to reduce carryover of solution, to minimize the time each embryo spends in AT, and to prevent embryos from touching the bottom of the dish. \n**IMPORTANT:**  Do not transfer embryos without zona pellucida into the AT solution\nii. Pipette up and down a few times and transfer the embryo into a fresh droplet of AT solution\niii. Repeat step ii until the zona pellucida starts disappearing\niv. Transfer the embryo without the zona pellucida to a droplet of M2 medium to neutralize the AT solution\nv. Transfer the embryo to a fresh droplet of M2 medium\nvi. Transfer the embryo to a droplet of IVC1 medium\nvii. Transfer the embryo to a well of an ibiTreat µ-plate filled with pre-equilibrated IVC1\n**TIP:**  after transferring the embryo from droplet to droplet, the pipette tip will have traces of mineral oil on the outside; to avoid carryover of mineral oil into the culturing media, make sure to wash the pipette tip by dipping it in IVC1 before final transfer\n**? TROUBLESHOOTING**",
    "10. Place the ibiTreat µ-plate in the incubator and incubate overnight\n  **TIP:**  We routinely culture between 1 and 3 embryos per well\n**CAUTION:**  We have found that sometimes the bottom of the ibiTreat µ-plates cracks when incubated overnight in the incubator.  To prevent this from happening, we recommend to fill all the wells of the µ-plate \\(wells not containing embryos can be filled with 1xPBS) and to position the µ-plate so that the bottom is not in direct contact with the heated surface of the incubator shelf \\(e.g. by placing the µ-plate on top of a cell culture dish used as a spacer)\n**TIP:**  We recommend using only the 4 central wells of the µ-plate as the outer wells might not be imaged in their entirety when using certain microscope stages or objectives.  Bear this in mind when placing the embryos in the µ-plate. \n**Part 2:  Culture embryos in ibiTreat µ-plates**\n11. Visually inspect the embryos to assess and record morphology\n  **IMPORTANT:** only embryos that display the classic “hollow-ball” blastocyst morphology after overnight culture have the potential of growing and developing further; we recommend removing from the culture those embryos that lack blastocyst morphology at this stage\n12. Using a stereomicroscope, replace half of the media in each well \\(100 µl) with the same volume \\(100 µl) of fresh, pre-equilibrated IVC1\n  **CAUTION:**  Ensure not to disturb the floating human embryos\n13. Place the ibiTreat µ-plate in the incubator and incubate overnight\n  14. The next day, visually inspect the embryos under a stereomicroscope\n  a. If the embryos are attached, remove half of the media \\(100 µl) and replace it with 150 µl of pre-equilibrated IVC2\n**CAUTION:**  Do not let the attached embryo\\(s) dry up",
    "b. If embryos have not yet attached, replace half of the media in each well \\(100 µl) with the same volume \\(100 µl) of fresh, pre-equilibrated IVC1\n**TIP:**  If there are both attached and not attached embryos in a well, use a P200 to carefully and gently transfer the unattached embryos to a different well filled with pre-equilibrated IVC1\n15. Place the ibiTreat µ-plate in the incubator and incubate overnight\n  16. Each day, replace half of the media in each well \\(100 µl) with the same volume \\(100 µl) of fresh, pre-equilibrated IVC2. Repeat every day until the desired analysis time-point is reached\n  **IMPORTANT:**  Current guidelines limit the culturing period to DPF14 \\(International Society for Stem Cell Research, 2006; National Research Council \\(US) Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research Advisory Committee, 2010), at which point growth and development of all embryos needs to be halted \\(e.g. by fixation)\n**Part 3:  Fix and Immunostain embryos**\n17. Fix the embryos in the ibiTreat µ-plate with freshly prepared 4% PFA in PBS for 30 min at 4°C\n  18. Wash 3x 20 min in PBS at room temperature\n  19. Quench 30 min in Quench Buffer at room temperature  \n  **CAUTION:** Sodium azide is highly toxic and can be explosive if dried or not rinsed through copper pipes\nPAUSE POINT: Embryos are best stained and analyzed right away, but may be stored in Quench Buffer at 4°C for several months in humidified chambers.  Check the buffer volume at least once a month and adjust up with water if low\n20. Block 2 h at room temperature\n  21. Stain embryos with primary antibodies diluted in Block Buffer for 5-12 h at room temperature, 3-4 h at 37°C, or overnight at 4°C.",
    "**IMPORTANT:**  Identify optimal dilution of antibodies first on pluripotent or differentiated human embryonic stem cells, then test on the embryos.  \n**TIP:** We routinely stain all embryos first with antibodies against OCT4 or NANOG to identify normal embryos \\(i.e. embryos with typical size and organization of ICM/Epiblast) for further analyses\n22. Wash at least 3x 20 min at room temperature\n  **IMPORTANT:** Extra washes or longer durations are encouraged, especially for older \\(and therefore larger) embryos\n23. Stain embryos with secondary antibodies in Block Buffer for 5-12 h at room temperature, 3-4 h at 37°C, or overnight at 4°C.\n  **NOTE:** Whole IgG secondaries have higher molar ratio of conjugated fluorophore and are thus generally brighter and recommended.  However, if serial staining with primaries of the same species is required \\(see \"BOX 2\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4397/original/Box_2.docx?1459343012), then Fab fragment secondaries are recommended since they offer more limited cross-reactivity.\n24. Incubate with DAPI for 5-12 h at room temperature, 3-4 h at 37°C, or overnight at 4°C.\n  **NOTE:**  DAPI signal is gradually lost after 1-2 months of storage in aqueous buffer\n25. Incubate with Phalloidin for 5-12 h at room temperature, 3-4 h at 37°C, or overnight at 4°C\n  **IMPORTANT:**  Phalloidin-647 and –555 signal is rapidly lost within 1-3 h of staining, therefore embryos should be imaged immediately \\(after 2 brief washes to remove excess staining).  Samples can be restained with Phalloidin several times.\n**Part 4:  Image embryos**\n26. Image embryos attached to the bottom of the ibiTreat µ-plate in Wash Buffer using an inverted confocal microscope with z-correction \\(laser intensity and/or gain) and high NA air or water immersion objectives \\(20x-40x).  Images should be at least 12 bits/pixel, 1024x1024 pixels, line averaging as needed \\(at least 2x).",
    "**TIP:** A white light laser \\(WLL) with tunable excitation is ideal to select optimal excitation wavelengths, thus minimizing potential cross-excitation of adjacent fluorophores.  Similarly, a gated detector where emission windows can be tailored to maximize signal and minimize potential cross-talk is ideal.  \n**NOTE:** Typical excitation/emission settings for DAPI, and Alexa 488, 555, and 647 are: 405 diode laser/ 415-486,  WLL 492/500-550, WLL 552/560-621, and WLL 649/657-710;  when 594 is added, the setting for Alexa 555 needs to be adjusted to 560-580, and a 5th track is added at WLL 594/602-631.\n**TIP:** Use the recommended Nyquist z-interval for best resolution; interval slightly larger than Nyquist, but smaller than the optical section thickness also work well.\n**IMPORTANT:** Signal intensity drops progressively after <sub>30um into the sample.  It is therefore essential to establish intensity correction curves for each channel before imaging.  Starting with DAPI, image from the bottom to the top of the embryo and progressively increase the laser power from 0.1 to 100 percent as needed \\(typically </sub>1-50% for DAPI) to maintain constant DAPI signal with increasing depth into the sample, always avoiding saturation. Increase gains if necessary \\(typically and preferentially no more than 20% to avoid noise). Save and apply the correction curve during image acquisition, and repeat for all channels. Care must be taken not to increase noise by increasing power in z regions of the sample where there is no obvious positive control signal.  It is useful to refer to the shape of the DAPI curve for general guidance for the other channels, but consider specifics of the sample and marker in each other channel.\n**? TROUBLESHOOTING**",
    "27. Deconvolve images using Autoquant’s 3D blind deconvolution algorithm for 10 iterations with default parameters.  Final images should be exported to 16 bit floating point tiffs. **TIP:**  Sharpness is substantially enhanced by deconvolution.  \n  **IMPORTANT:**  Make sure all imaging parameters, objective identity and NA, fluorophore, and mounting medium are accurately entered into the deconvolution algorithm.\n28. Import deconvolved tiff files into Imaris.  \n  **IMPORTANT:**  Check the image properties to ensure that x, y, z dimensions are read appropriately from the metadata on import and adjust if necessary.\n29. Explore data in Imaris’ 3D and slice modes to reveal 3D tissue organization of cell lineages and to segment cells in 3D using spot finding or surface algorithms as appropriate with parameters determined from size and signal-to-noise threshold of features of interest.\n  30. Movies can be exported for 3D display.  Always set rendering quality to the highest level \\(“1”), use 24 frames per second \\(fps), no compression, and high definition format for export.\n  **TIP:** We have found that Imaris versions 7.0 is the most reliable for smooth export of high quality movies."
