    "1. Preparation of Nanoparticle Samples\nPrepare the study sample in LAL grade water.\nIf the sample pH is outside of the 6-8 range, adjust the pH by using pyrogen-free sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid.\nUsing LAL grade water prepare several dilutions of the study sample. Make sure that the highest dilution does not exceed maximum valid dilution (MVD). Refer to the discussion section for details about MVD estimation.\n2. Preparation of Reagents Common Between LAL Formats\nDilute concentrated sodium hydroxide stock using pyrogen-free LAL reagent water to prepare a working solution at a concentration of 0.1 N.\nDilute concentrated hydrochloric acid stock using pyrogen-free LAL reagent water and prepare a working solution at a final concentration of 0.1 N.\nPreparation of the Control Standard Endotoxin (CSE)\n\t\nReconstitute the CSE according to the certificate of analysis supplied by the manufacturer.\n\t\tNOTE: Refer to the discussion section for important notes regarding the information provided in the certificate. Refer to the Table of Materials for the details regarding catalog number and application of a given CSE formulation in different LAL formats.\nPreparation of the LAL Reagent\n\t\nReconstitute the LAL reagent according to the certificate of analysis provided by the manufacturer.\n\t\tNOTE: Refer to the discussion section for important details regarding LAL reagent preparation. Refer to the Table of Materials for the details regarding catalog number and application of a given LAL reagent formulation in different LAL format.\n3. Turbidity LAL Assay\nPreparation of the Calibration Standards\n\t\nUsing 900 µL of LAL grade water and 100 µL of CSE, prepare as many intermediate dilutions as needed to enable the preparation of a calibration standard with a concentration range from 0.001 to 1 EU/mL.",
    "First label tubes and add 900 μL of LAL-grade water into each tube. Then add 100 μL of 10 EU/mL solutionn to prepare calibration standard with concentration of 1EU/mL.\nRepeat the serial 10-fold dilution as described above to prepare three lower calibration standards. Verify that four calibration standards ranging from 0.001 to 1 EU/mL have been prepared.\nPreparation of the Quality Controls\n\t\nPrepare a 0.05 EU/mL quality control by combining 50 µL of the 1 EU/mL CSE solution with 950 µL of LAL-grade water.\n\t\tNOTE: Refer to the discussion section for details regarding control preparation.\nPreparation of Inhibition/Enhancement (IEC) Controls\n\t\nPrepare IEC with concentration of 0.05 EU/mL by combining 25 µL of the 1 EU/mL CSE solution and 475 µL of the test nanomaterial at a given dilution.\n\t\tNOTE: Refer to the discussion section for additional details.\nExperimental procedure\n\t\nAllow the instrument to warm up by turning it on approximately 30 min in advance. Set-up the detection wavelength to 660 nm as this is appropriate for the turbidity LAL.\nSign in by typing the username and password.\nOpen the software (Table of Materials) by clicking on the corresponding icon on a computer screen.\nSelect Collect data on the software home screen. Enter the test ID and data group information into the corresponding space in the General tab on the home screen.\nClick the Hardware tab. Choose the instrument type from a dropdown menu.\nSet-up the detection wavelength to 660 nm as this is appropriate for the turbidity LAL by chosing the LAL turbidity method.\nVerify that a serial number, system ID and serial port information appear on the screen. Click OK. Click OK one more time to confirm.",
    "Enter the sample ID in the same order the sample is tested. Use default buttons to enter the negative control, standard curve and test samples. \nPrepare duplicate tubes for each sample and add 200 µL (test ratio 4:1) or 100 µL (test ratio 1:1) of negative control (water), calibration standards, quality control, IEC and test nanoparticles into pre-labeled glass tubes.\nAdd 50 µL (test ratio 4:1) or 100 µL (test ratio 1:1) of LAL reagent to first test vial, vortex it briefly, and insert into test slot in the instrument carousel. If the 1:1 ratio is used, the volume of the LAL reagent is 100 µL.\nRepeat the procedure described above for other samples. Process samples one at a time.\n\t\tNOTE: Refer to the discussion section for more details.\n4. Chromogenic LAL\nPreparation of Calibration Standards\n\t\nUsing 900 µL of LAL grade water and 100 µL of CSE, prepare as many intermediate dilutions as needed to enable the preparation of a calibration standard with a concentration of 1 EU/mL.\nUsing 900 µL LAL-grade water and 100 µL of the 1 EU/mL calibration standard, prepare a second calibration standard at a concentration of 0.1 EU/mL.\nRepeat the serial 10-fold dilution as described above to prepare two lower calibration standards. Verify that four calibration standards ranging from 0.001 to 1 EU/mL have been prepared.\nPreparation of Quality Controls.\n\t\nPrepare a 0.05 EU/mL quality control by combining 50 µL of the 1 EU/mL CSE solution with 950 µL of LAL-grade water.\n\t\tNOTE: Refer to the discussion section for details regarding control preparation.\nPreparation of Inhibition/Enhancement (IEC) Controls\n\t\nPrepare 0.05 EU/mL by combining 25 μL of the 1 EU/mL CSE solution with 475 μL of test nanomaterial.\n\t\tNOTE: Refer to the discussion section for additional details.\nExperimental procedure",
    "Allow the instrument to warm up by turning it on approximately 30 min in advance. Set-up the detection wavelength to 405 nm as this is appropriate for the turbidity LAL.\nOpen the software by clicking on the corresponding icon on a computer screen. Sign in by typing the username and password.\nSelect Collect data on the software home screen. Enter test ID and data group information into corresponding space in the General tab on the home screen.\nClick the Hardware tab. Choose the instrument type from a dropdown menu.

    "NOTE: This assay identifies the presence of endotoxins in the sample based on the visual observation and detection of a clot in the reaction tube. The experimental steps are described below. Use a bench sheet to record the results. This bench sheet is not mandatory, and other ways of recording the assay results are also acceptable. An example of such a bench sheet is provided in supplementary materials for the convenience of a reader. Lambda (l) is the sensitivity of the gel-clot assay and is 0.03 EU/mL.\nLabel as many reaction tubes as needed to accommodate the number of analyzed test samples. Refer to the bench sheet for details about the number of replicates used in step 1, step 2 and step 3 of the assay.\nAliquot 100 μL of water, controls or test sample per tube.\nPrepare CSE such that the final concentration is equal to 4λ.\nCombine 100 μL of the standard mentioned above with 100 μL of water or test sample to achieve the final concentration of CSE of 2λ. Repeat three more times to achieve lambda and half-lambda and a quarter lambda.\nMake sure that the temperature in the water bath is 37 °C.\nAdd 100 μL of lysate per test tube, vortex briefly and place the rack with all the tubes into the water bath for 1 h.\nInvert the tube with a smooth motion.\nManually record results using “+” (firm clot) or “-“ (no clot or loose clot) on the bench sheet.\nProceed with the analysis according to the USP BET 854;use the bench sheet as supporting material\nSubscription Required.
