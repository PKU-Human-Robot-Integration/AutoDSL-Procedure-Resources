    "The most common use of PubChem is to search for a specific piece of information on a chemical. This is typically done by performing a text search with a chemical name as a query, going to the Summary page of the best hit compound returned from the search, and locating the desired information on that page. This process is shown in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-prot-0001], which demonstrates how to find proteins and genes known to interact with losartan (CID 3961), a widely used antihypertensive drug.\nThe chemical-protein and chemical-gene interaction data in PubChem originate from multiple sources, such as DrugBank (Wishart et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-bib-0048]), Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD; Davis et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-bib-0010]), Drug-Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb; Freshour et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-bib-0012]), IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY (Armstrong et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-bib-0001]), ChEMBL (Mendez et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-bib-0037]), and RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB; Burley et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-bib-0006]). The biological test results for a chemical can also be a good source for its interactions with macromolecules. While the interaction data from DrugBank is retrieved in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-prot-0001] as an example, the chemical-macromolecule associations from one data source are not necessarily the same as those from other sources. Therefore, it is recommended to access the data from all relevant sources and review the variances in the related records.\nMaterials\nAn up-to-date Web browser, such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari, or Firefox, is required for this protocol (and all other protocols in this article)\n1. Go to the PubChem homepage (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov[href=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov]).",
    "The PubChem homepage serves as the entry point for various PubChem services. It has a search box that accepts various types of text queries, and examples are provided below the search box. These examples include chemical names (e.g., aspirin), gene symbols (e.g., EGFR), chemical abstract services (CAS) registry numbers (e.g., 57-27-2), and molecular formulas (e.g., C9H8O4). It is also possible to search using line notations for chemical structures, such as the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES; Weininger, 1988[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-bib-0043], 1990[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-bib-0044]; Weininger, Weininger, & Weininger, 1989[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-bib-0045]) and the IUPAC International Chemical Identifier (InChI; Heller, McNaught, Pletnev, Stein, & Tchekhovskoi, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-bib-0022]). The integer-type identifiers for PubChem records (i.e., SID, CID, and AID) can also be used as a query.\n2. Type losartan in the search box and click on the search (magnifying glass) button (‘1’ in Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-fig-0001]).\nPubChem's search interface has an autocomplete/autosuggestion function. When a query is typed in the search box, the interface suggests a list of potential queries. This allows the user to quickly search PubChem by clicking one of the suggested terms.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a62545bc-6aeb-4c90-8ea4-71edb3be3893/cpz1217-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nSearching PubChem using a text query. When a text query is provided (1), PubChem searches multiple collections for relevant records, and the hits from each collection can be viewed by clicking the corresponding tab (indicated in the purple box). When possible, PubChem suggests the best hit at the top of the search results. For example, when the chemical name losartan is used as a query, PubChem suggests CID 3961 as the best hit. Clicking this record or one of the hits found in the Compound collection directs the user to its compound page (2).\n3. Click the best match shown at the top of the search results (‘2’ in Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-fig-0001]) to go to the Summary page for the selected compound.",
    "When a search term is entered, PubChem simultaneously searches multiple data collections. The search result page has tabs that allow the user to view the hits from different collections (indicated in the purple box in Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-fig-0001]). For compounds and substances (PubChem, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-bib-0041]), a text query finds chemicals whose names match it. For other data collections (such as genes, proteins, pathways, literature, and patents), returned hits contain the query string within the records.\nWhen possible, PubChem tries to identify the most relevant record and display it at the top of the search result list. For the query losartan, PubChem identifies CID 3961 as the most relevant record. Clicking on this record directs the user to the Compound Summary page for CID 3961.\n4. Go to the “DrugBank Interactions” subsection under the “Biomolecular Interactions and Pathways” section (‘2’ in Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-fig-0002]), using the Table of Contents on the right column (‘1’ in Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-fig-0002]).\nThe Compound Summary page often contains a large amount of information, especially for well-studied and well-known compounds. The user can navigate this page using the Table of Contents, available in the right column. Alternatively, one may quickly search for a term or a particular string within the Summary page by pressing Ctrl+F (on a Windows/Linux PC) or Command+F (on a Mac) on the keyboard.\nThe “DrugBank Interactions” subsection contains information on the macromolecules that interact with CID 3961 (losartan), curated by DrugBank. In DrugBank, macromolecules are classified into four groups according to the type of interaction with a drug molecule: targets, enzymes, carriers, and transporters. Among the macromolecules listed in this section, the “type-1 angiotensin II receptor” is classified as a target, meaning that the therapeutic effect of losartan comes from its interaction with this protein.",
    "Clicking the target name “type-1 angiotensin II receptor” in this section directs the user to the corresponding page in DrugBank, where more detailed information can be found. Additional information is available on the Gene and Protein Summary pages, which can be accessed by clicking the gene symbol (e.g., “AGTR1”) in the “PubChem Gene” column and the accession (e.g., “P30556”) in the “PubChem Protein” column. The PubChem Gene and Protein pages are further explained in Basic Protocols 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-prot-0006] and 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-prot-0007].\nEach section/subsection in a Summary page can be bookmarked for quick access. For example, the DrugBank Interactions subsection for CID 3961 is directly accessible via the URL https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/3961#section=DrugBank-Interactions[href=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/3961#section=DrugBank-Interactions].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/cb06c498-2199-44d3-967a-c1c25970308b/cpz1217-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nNavigating the Compound Summary page of losartan (CID 3961) (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/3961[href=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/3961]). The user can navigate the Compound Summary page using the Table of Contents (1), available in the right column. One may find the macromolecules that losartan interacts with by clicking the “DrugBank Interactions” (2) from the Table of Contents. The information presented in each section can be downloaded by clicking the “Download” button (3). When there is too much information to present in a section of the Summary page, only the first few pieces of information are shown. To view all information available for the section, the user should click the full-screen view button (4). All information presented on the Compound Summary page can be downloaded through the “Download” button available at the top-right corner of the Compound Summary page (indicated in the purple box).\n5. Click the “Download” button to download the list of the macromolecules interacting with losartan (‘3’ in Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-fig-0002]).",
    "The data on the Compound Summary pages is regularly updated. When the data in an original data source is updated, this change is also reflected in PubChem through the next update cycle. Therefore, it is highly recommended to save the necessary data on a local computer.\n6. If necessary, click the full-screen view button (‘4’ in Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-fig-0002]) to view all rows and columns.\nBy default, a Summary page often shows only a part of the available data. For example, the “DrugBank Interactions” subsection in this protocol displays only the first few rows and columns of the tabular data. The remaining data can be viewed in the full-screen view mode.",
    "PubChem's search interface provides many features beyond the simple text search. For example, it supports a search by chemical structure. A chemical structure can be used as a query for various types of structure searches, including identity search, 2-D and 3-D similarity searches, and substructure and superstructure searches. The input chemical structure can be specified with a line notation (e.g., SMILES or InChI) or drawn using the PubChem Sketcher. If the input structure already exists in the PubChem Compound database, its CID can be used as a query. It is also possible to initiate a chemical structure search from one of the hit compounds returned from a previous search. More details about chemical structure searches in PubChem are outlined in the Background Information section of this article.\nAnother important feature of PubChem's search interface is that it provides filters that limit the search results to only those records with the desired attributes. Each data collection has a different set of filters. For example, the compound records can be filtered based on several molecular properties, such as molecular weight, hydrogen bond donor and acceptor counts, rotatable bond count, etc. The assay records can be filtered based on data sources and assay types (e.g., in vivo, in vitro, cell-based, biochemical, etc.). Taxonomy information can be used to filter the gene and protein records.",
    "Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-prot-0002], designed to demonstrate these two features (i.e., chemical structure search and filtering), aims to find drug-like chemicals that are structurally similar to a given chemical. In this protocol, the CID of the best hit compound returned from the text query losartan (in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-prot-0001]) is used to specify the input chemical structure for a subsequent 2-D similarity search. The resulting compound list is further refined with filters to identify compounds that meet all criteria of Lipinski's rule of five (Lipinski, Lombardo, Dominy, & Feeney, 1997[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-bib-0036]), which is a rule of thumb to evaluate drug-likeness of molecules. The refined compound list, along with the computed properties, is downloaded on a local computer.\nMaterials\nAn up-to-date Web browser, such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari, or Firefox, is required for this protocol (and all other protocols in this article)\n1. Repeat steps 1-2 of Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-prot-0001] to search PubChem using losartan as a query.\n2. Click the “Similar Structures Search” link at the bottom of the top panel that shows the best match (‘1’ in Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-fig-0003]).\nFor each hit compound returned from a search, PubChem provides links to the commonly requested information on that compound. One of the links is the \"Similar Structures Search\" link, which allows one to use that compound as a query to perform a 2-D similarity search and other types of structure searches (i.e., identity, substructure, superstructure, and 3-D similarity searches). As implied by the name of the link (“Similar Structures Search”), 2-D similarity search results are shown by default (‘2’ in Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-fig-0003]). The results of the other types of searches can be viewed by clicking the corresponding tab.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/42da4498-e847-4b98-94d8-70fc06638663/cpz1217-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3",
    "Performing a similarity search using a hit compound returned from a previous search. Each hit compound is presented with links that allow the user to access commonly requested data or services relevant to the compound. Among them is the “Similar Structures Search” link (1). Clicking this link will invoke multiple structure searches [including 2-D similarity search (2)] using the compound as a query and present the search results. The user can rerun the 2-D similarity search with a different similarity threshold (3) and apply filters (4) to refine the hit compounds based on several molecular properties. The hit compound list can be downloaded using the “Download” button (5). The result for the 3-D similarity search can be viewed by clicking the “3D similarity” tab (indicated in the purple box).\n3. If necessary, click the Settings button (‘3’ in Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-fig-0003]) and adjust the similarity threshold to a desired value.\nDuring a 2-D similarity search, the similarity between the query and all compounds in PubChem is evaluated using the PubChem substructure fingerprint (PubChem, 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-bib-0040]) and the Tanimoto Coefficient (Chen & Reynolds, 2002[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-bib-0008]; Holliday, Hu, & Willett, 2002[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-bib-0023]; Holliday, Salim, Whittle, & Willett, 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-bib-0024]). When the Tanimoto Coefficient between the query and a compound is greater than or equal to the similarity threshold [0.9 (or 90%) by default], the compound is considered to be similar to the query and returned as a hit. The similarity threshold is adjustable. If the similarity threshold is increased [e.g., to 0.99 (or 99%)], the similarity search returns a smaller number of hit compounds that are more similar to the query. If a lower threshold is used [e.g., 0.85 (or 0.85%)], the search gives a greater number of hits that are more diverse, but less similar to the query.",
    "4. Click the “Filters” button (‘4’ in Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-fig-0003]) and refine the hits to only drug-like compounds that satisfy Lipinski's rule of five.\nWhen the “Filters” button is clicked, the interactive histograms for some important molecular properties will be shown. Changing the minimum and maximum values of each property limits the hits to those compounds whose values for that property are within the specified range.\nLipinski's rule of five (Lipinski et al., 1997[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-bib-0036]) evaluates the drug-likeness of a chemical, based on chemical and physical properties important for the pharmacokinetics of the chemical (e.g., its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion in the human body). According to Lipinski's rule of five, an orally active drug typically has the following properties:\n         \nA molecular weight less than 500 g/mol\nNo more than 5 hydrogen bond donors\nNo more than 10 hydrogen bond acceptors\nAn octanol-water partition coefficient (log P) that does not exceed 5.\nAlthough PubChem has experimental log P values for more than 26,000 compounds, this corresponds to a very small fraction of the 100+ million compounds in PubChem, and it is not practical to use the experimental log P values as a filter to refine the search results. Therefore, for this purpose, PubChem uses computed log P values, called “XLogP” (Cheng et al., 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-bib-0009]). The XLogP values are available for more than 90% of compounds in PubChem (except for inorganic and organometallic compounds).\n5. Click the “Download” button (‘5’ in Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-fig-0003]) to save the hit list as a CSV file for further analysis.",
    "The downloaded file contains the list of hit compounds and their computed molecular properties (such as molecular weight, heavy atom count, rotatable bond count, hydrogen bond donor and acceptor counts, polar surface area, molecular complexity, and XLogP). It also contains additional information [e.g., the assays in which the compounds were tested, the digital object identifiers (DOIs) for the articles that mention the compounds, the creation dates of the compound records, etc.]. This file can be loaded into a spreadsheet program (e.g., Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets) or a computer script (e.g., written in python or R) for further analysis.",
    "PubChem's search interface supports both 2-D and 3-D similarity searches. The molecular similarity methods used for the two similarity searches are complementary to each other. That is, one method can often recognize structural similarity that is unnoticed by the other approach. A brief overview of the underlying methods used in the 3-D similarity search is given in Background Information.\nIn Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-prot-0003], a 3-D similarity search is performed to find the compounds structurally similar to losartan based on 3-D similarity scores, and the 3-D structures of the returned compounds are downloaded in a structure-data file (SDF) format. The downloaded SDF file can be opened in popular 3-D molecular viewers. Note that these 3-D structures are not experimentally determined, but computationally generated as described in detail in previous papers (Bolton, Kim, & Bryant, 2011a[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-bib-0004]; Kim, Bolton, & Bryant, 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-bib-0028]).\nMaterials\nAn up-to-date Web browser, such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari, or Firefox, is required for this protocol (and all other protocols in this article)\n1.

Click the “3D Similarity” tab to view the hit list for the 3-D similarity search (the purple box in Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-fig-0003]).",
    "Because molecules can have multiple conformers, the 3-D similarity score between two molecules is determined by selecting the highest score from the 3-D similarity scores computed for all possible conformer pairs arising from the molecules. While up to ten conformers per compound are available for 3-D similarity computation, it is not practical to perform a 3-D similarity search against all compounds using up to ten conformers per compound, because a 3-D similarity search is much slower and more resource-intensive. Therefore, to find most information-rich hits in a reasonable response time, a three-tier approach is introduced for 3-D similarity search. In this approach, compounds are classified into three tiers, based on their information content, and different numbers of conformers per compound are used during 3-D similarity search:\n         \nTier 1: Compounds with annotations, using up to ten conformers per compound\nTier 2: Compounds with patent links, using up to five conformers per compound\nTier 3: All remaining compounds, using up to three conformers per compound.\nBy default, a 3-D similarity search is performed against only the Tier 1 compounds (using up to ten conformers per compound). The search can be extended to the Tier 2 or Tier 3 compounds using the “SETTINGS” button (‘1’ in Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-fig-0004]), but a smaller number of conformers per compound will be used.",
    "Also, note that it is not possible to adjust the 3-D similarity search threshold, in contrast to the 2-D similarity search threshold (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-prot-0002]). During the 3-D similarity search, two compounds are considered to be similar if any conformer pair arising from them has a shape-Tanimoto (ST) score of ≥0.80 (or 80%) and a color-Tanimoto (CT) of ≥0.50 (or 50%) (Bolton, Kim, & Bryant, 2011b[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-bib-0005]; Kim, Bolton, & Bryant, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-bib-0029]).

The download button (2) allows for downloading compound records in various file formats.

To save the 3-D structures of hit compounds in an SDF format, select “3D” for the coordinate type, “10” for the number of conformers per compound, “gzip” for compression, and “SDF” for file format (‘3’ through ‘6’ in Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-fig-0004]).\nPubChem generates a conformer model for each compound if it satisfies the following criteria:\n         \nNot too large (with ≤50 non-hydrogen atoms)\nNot too flexible (with ≤15 rotatable bonds)\nHas fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereocenters\nHas only a single covalently bonded unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture)",
    "Consists of only supported organic elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I)\nContains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field (Halgren, 1996, 1996a[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-bib-0018]b, 1999[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-bib-0020]).\nAbout 87% of compounds have computationally generated conformer models, and if a compound in the hit list does not have a conformer model, that compound will be ignored for download. While each of these conformer models contains up to 500 conformers, only up to 10 conformers per compound are accessible by the public. More detailed information on conformer generation in PubChem can be found in previous papers (Bolton et al., 2011a[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-bib-0003]; Kim et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-bib-0028]).",
    "Basic Protocols 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-prot-0002] and 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-prot-0003] demonstrate how to find compounds that are structurally similar to a query compound based on 2-D and 3-D similarity scores, respectively. However, the data returned from the similarity searches do not include the similarity scores between the query and the returned compounds. These scores can be used to sort the hit compounds and find higher-ranked compounds within the list. They can also be used to perform a cluster analysis to identify important structural patterns of the hit compounds.\nIn this Support Protocol, we download the 3-D similarity scores for the compounds returned from a 2-D similarity search (in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-prot-0002]) using the PubChem Score Matrix Service (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/score_matrix[href=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/score_matrix]). The PubChem Score Matrix Service computes 2-D and 3-D similarity scores between compounds in PubChem. This service takes a list of M compounds and another list of N compounds as an input, computes similarity scores for M × N compound pairs arising from the combination of the two lists, and returns the scores in a matrix form or in a list of CID-CID-score triples. When only one list (of M compounds) is provided as an input, similarity scores are computed for M(M+1)/2 unique CID pairs, arising from the combination of the M compounds.\nMaterials\nAn up-to-date Web browser, such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari, or Firefox, is required for this protocol (and all other protocols in this article)",
    "In addition, this protocol requires a text file containing the CIDs of the hit compounds returned from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-prot-0002]. This file can be generated from the CSV file downloaded in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-prot-0002]. Open the CSV file in spreadsheet software (e.g., Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets). Copy the first column containing the CIDs (except for the column header), paste them into a text editor (e.g., Notepad on Windows PC and TextEdit on Mac), and save them as a text file. In this protocol, the file name is assumed to be mycids.txt. Double-check that the file has the same format as the mycids.txt file in Figure 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-fig-0005] (e.g., one CID for each line).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/11a8dba4-df38-40a8-975c-df13e0312e9a/cpz1217-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nComputing similarity scores between compounds, using the PubChem Score Matrix Service (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/score_matrix/[href=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/score_matrix/]). One of three score types (2-D similarity as well as shape- and feature-optimized 3-D similarities) can be selected through a dropdown menu (1). Additional options (2) are available for 3-D similarity score computation. The list(s) of CIDs for similarity score computation can be provided in a text box or uploaded in a file (3). The output format (4) and compression method (5) can be selected through dropdown menus. Clicking the “Submit Job” button starts the similarity score computation.\n1. Go to the PubChem Score Matrix Service (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/score_matrix[href=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/score_matrix]).\nThis page can also be reached via PubChemDocs (https://pubchemdocs.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov[href=https://pubchemdocs.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov]), which contains PubChem's help documents. It also serves as an entry point to various PubChem services. The help page for the Score Matrix Service can be found under the “Search and Analysis” section of PubChemDocs, and this page has a link to the Score Matrix Service.\n2. Select “3D Similarity, shape optimized” for the score type (‘1’ in Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-fig-0005]).",
    "Three similarity measures are supported: one 2-D similarity measure and two 3-D similarity measures (shape-optimized and feature-optimized). For more details about these similarity measures, see Background Information.\n3. Select “1 conformer per CID” and check the “Do not substitute 3D parents” box (‘2’ in Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-fig-0005]).\nUp to ten conformers per compound can be considered during the 3-D similarity computation. Note that some compounds do not have conformer models, as mentioned in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-prot-0003]. For example, PubChem does not generate a conformer model for salts and mixtures, but their parent forms may have 3-D models. A parent compound is conceptually the \"important\" part of the molecule when the molecule has more than one covalently bonded unit. Specifically, a parent component must have at least one carbon and contain at least 70% of the heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms of all the unique covalently bonded units (ignoring stoichiometry).\nBy default, if a given CID does not have a 3-D conformer model, but its parent structure does, the parent CID will automatically be substituted in the matrix. Checking the \"do not substitute 3D parents\" box disables this substitution and returns results for only the requested CIDs with 3-D conformer models.\n4. Select the text file containing the input CID list (i.e., mycids.txt; ‘3’ in Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-fig-0005]).\nThe input CID list can be uploaded in a file or typed into the text box. When only one list is provided, the similarity scores between compounds within the list are computed. If a second CID list is given, the similarity scores are computed for all CID-CID pairs arising from the combination of the two CID lists.",
    "Note that there is a limit on the size of the score matrix that this service can handle. Currently, for 2-D similarity computation, both the primary and optional compound lists should have no more than 10,000 compounds, and the number of compound pairs to consider should not exceed 1,000,000. For 3-D similarity computation, the limits are no more than 10,000 “conformers” for both lists and no more than 1,000,000 “conformer pairs.. Therefore, if 3-D similarity computation fails due to the size limit, it may be necessary to reduce the number of conformers to consider (‘2’ in Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-fig-0005]).\n5.

    "When a chemical structure pattern appears in a bigger chemical structure, the former is called a substructure and the latter is referred to as a superstructure (see Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-fig-0006]). In this protocol, a substructure search is performed to find compounds with a given substructure, and their bioactivity data are downloaded on a local computer. The downloaded data can be used in further analysis by means of third-party software packages. This protocol uses two important features of PubChem's search interface, the PubChem Sketcher for structure input and the “Linked Data Sets” button for quick retrieval of linked data.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9bfc9af0-9d48-4fd4-a36b-af6c07b8184f/cpz1217-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\nThe concept of the substructure and superstructure. The structure of CID 15207492 (substructure) appears as a part of CID 3961 (superstructure).\nPreviously, in Basic Protocols 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-prot-0002] and 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-prot-0003], a chemical name search (i.e., losartan as a query) was first performed to find the corresponding compound (CID 3961), which was used to specify the input chemical structure for a subsequent 2-D and 3-D similarity search. However, this approach cannot be used when the query structure does not exist in PubChem or when its name is unknown or ambiguous. In this case, the input structure can be provided by drawing it in the PubChem Sketcher.\nThis protocol also exemplifies the usefulness of linked data in PubChem. As mentioned in the Introduction, PubChem has multiple data collections. Some users often need to retrieve records in one data collection that are related to those in another data collection. For example, the present protocol retrieves bioactivity data (in BioAssay) associated with a list of chemicals (in Compound). This task can be done seamlessly with the “Linked Data Sets” button available on the search result page.\nMaterials",

This involves performing two independent searches (one for antihypertensive agents and the other for antiarrhythmic agents) and finding chemicals returned in both searches. PubChem users often need to perform a series of searches, followed by taking the intersection or union of the search results or identifying records returned from one search, but not from another.

    "This protocol demonstrates how to find stereoisomers and isotopomers of a given compound, with valsartan (CID 60846) as an example. This task can be done using identity search, which is one of the structure search types supported by PubChem. An identity search returns compounds identical to the query molecule. While it may sound straightforward, the search results can vary, depending on what is meant by “identical” compounds. PubChem's identity search allows for some flexibility in the definition of chemical identity. By default, two molecules are considered identical if they have the same connectivity, isotopism, and stereochemistry [i.e., (R/S)-configuration and cis/trans-isomerism]. The user can change this behavior by choosing to ignore isotopism and/or stereochemistry. When stereochemistry is ignored, compounds with the same connectivity and isotopism, but with varying stereochemistry (i.e., stereoisomers), are returned. If isotopism is ignored, the identity search finds compounds with the same connectivity and stereochemistry, but with different isotopes (i.e., isotopomers). In this protocol, identity search is performed with different definitions of chemical identity to find stereoisomers and isotopomers of valsartan (CID 60846), which is a structural analog of losartan.\nMaterials\nAn up-to-date Web browser, such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari, or Firefox, is required for this protocol (and all other protocols in this article)\n1. Go to the PubChem homepage, type CID 60846 structure (‘1’ in Fig. 15[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-fig-0015]), and hit the search button.\nThe query CID 60846 structure invokes a chemical structure search for CID 60846. If CID 60846 is used alone as a query (without structure), it will direct the user to the Compound Summary page of CID 60846.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e2e91738-f8e3-4516-8ed2-170e1c83852c/cpz1217-fig-0015-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 15",
    "Performing an identity search. The query “CID 60846 structure” (1) initiates various types of structure searches using the structure of 60846 as a query. The result of the identity search can be viewed by the “Identity” tab (2). The Settings button allows users to select one of the several definitions of chemical identity (3).\n2. Click the “Identity” tab (‘2’ in Fig. 15[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-fig-0015]) and the “Settings” button (‘3’ in Fig. 15[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-fig-0015]).\nThis will show the options that control the definition of chemical identity. By default, the “Same Stereo Isotope” option is selected, meaning that the search returns compounds with the same connectivity, stereochemistry, and isotope. The PubChem chemical structure standardization process (Hähnke et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-bib-0017]) ensures that chemical structures with the same connectivity, stereochemistry, and isotopism are assigned to an identical CID. Therefore, an identity search with the default option returns only one hit, the query itself, if the query molecule exists in the PubChem Compound database, or no hit if the query does not exist in Compound.\n3. Select the “Same Isotope” option to find stereoisomers of valsartan.\nAs mentioned previously, connectivity, isotopism, and stereochemistry are the three factors considered during an identity search. The “Same Isotope” option requires that identical compounds have the same connectivity and isotopes, but ignores stereochemistry. As a result, this option returns stereoisomers of the query molecule. For example, the query molecule (valsartan: CID 60846) has a chiral center in (S)-configuration, and the “Same Isotope” option returns three compounds: the query itself [(S)-form], CID 5284633 [(R)-form], and CID 5650 (with the “unspecified” configuration at its chiral center) (see Fig. 16[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-fig-0016]).",
    "Also, the identity search has options called “Nonconflicting Stereo” and “Same Isotope Nonconflicting Stereo” (Fig. 15[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.217#cpz1217-fig-0015]). These options help the user to deal with the ambiguity arising from stereocenters with unspecified configuration. For example, the unspecified configuration at the chiral center of CID 5650 means that the compound may be an (R)-form, (S)-form, or both (e.g., racemic mixture). CID 5650 may or may not have the same stereochemistry as the (S)-form (CID 60846), the query compound used for an identity search in this protocol. Therefore, these two CIDs are considered to have “nonconflicting” stereochemistry. In contrast, the (R)- and (S)-forms have “conflicting” stereochemistry, because they cannot have the same stereochemistry. The “Nonconflicting Stereo” and “Same Isotope Nonconflicting Stereo” options allow the user to take into account this ambiguity concerning unspecified stereo configuration. If the “Same Isotope Nonconflicting Stereo” option (rather than “Same Isotope”) is used in this step, the identity search will return only two compounds, the query compound ((S)-form) and CID 5650 (with unspecified stereochemistry).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/befc5418-cd00-4f2c-9ba3-5e01256fd9bc/cpz1217-fig-0016-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 16\nCompounds with conflicting and nonconflicting stereocenters.\n4. Download the returned stereoisomers in a CSV format.\n5. Select the “Same Stereo” option to find stereoisomers of valsartan.\nWith this option, chemical identity will be assessed based on connectivity and stereochemistry, but isotopism will be ignored. As a result, this step results in the query and its various isotopomers.\n6. Download the returned isotopomers in a CSV format."
