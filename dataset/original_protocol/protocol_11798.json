    "Prepare a Ca2+/Mg2+ stock solution by adding 0.927 g of calcium chloride dihydrate (CaCl2.2H2O) and 1 g of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (MgSO4.7H2O) to 500 mL of distilled water. Sterile filter the solution through a 0.2 µm bottle top filter into an autoclaved glass bottle and store at room temperature (RT).\nSupplement Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% Ca2+/Mg2+ solution and 2% FBS.\nSterile filter the solution under a laminar flow hood with 0.2 µm filter and syringe and store aliquots of 5 mL at -20 °C.\nFibronectin coating of tissue culture plates\n\t\nPrepare coating buffer (Buffer B) by dissolving 5.3 g of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3; 0.1 M) in 500 mL of deionized water. Adjust the pH of the buffer to 9.4 using 1 M hydrochloric acid (HCl). Filter under a laminar flow hood through a 0.2 µm bottle top filter into an autoclaved glass bottle and store at RT.\nFor coating, pipette 2 mL/5 mL/10 mL of Buffer B per 60 mm/100 mm/145 mm tissue culture plate, respectively. Add 1 µg/cm2 of human plasma fibronectin purified protein solution and gently distribute the liquid onto the plate.\nIncubate plate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 20 min.\nAspirate Buffer B and wash the plate with PBS prior to culturing cells.\n2. Isolation of endothelial cells from VM patient tissue\nIsolation of EC from solid VM tissue\n\tNOTE: VM tissue is resected by debulking surgery12,13 under an IRB approved protocol.\n\t\nWash VM tissue (tissue sample weight typically ranges between 0.5 g and 1.5 g) in 5% PSG in PBS.\nTransfer tissue to a 100 mm cell culture dish, mince tissue sample into small pieces using sterile surgical dissection tools, and transfer into a 50 mL conical tube.",
    "Add 100 µL of collagenase A stock solution to 5 mL of Buffer A for a final concentration of 1 mg/mL, then add this to the tissue and digest the minced tissue at 37 °C for 30 min while shaking contents every 5 min.\nCarefully grind the digested tissue at RT using a 6 mm, smooth-surface pestle grinder within the 50 mL conical tube.\nContinue to carefully grind digested tissue using a pestle while adding 5 mL of cold PBS supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 2% PSG. Repeat this step four times.\nFilter the solution through a 100 μm cell strainer into a 50 mL conical tube to remove tissue fragments.\nCentrifuge cell suspension for 5 min at 400 x g at RT. Proceed to step 2.3.\nIsolation of VM EC from lesional blood obtained from patient sclerotherapy\n\t\nObtain human VM lesional blood from sclerotherapy under an IRB approved protocol.\nDilute lesional blood (sample volume typically ranges between 0.5 mL and 5 mL) in PBS to a final volume of 40 mL.\nCentrifuge cell suspension for 5 min at 200 x g at RT.\nInitial cell plating\n\t\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend the single-cell pellet in 1 mL of EGM.\nAdd 9 mL of complete EGM onto fibronectin-coated (1 µg/cm²) 100 mm plates and seed 1 mL of cell suspension.\nIncubate cells at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.\nEvery other day remove 2 mL of media and add 2 mL of sterile filtered FBS.\nOnce cell cultures reach a confluency of 40‒50% change the medium to complete EGM. It typically takes between 2‒3 weeks for the cells to reach this confluency.",
    "Observe daily for the appearance of EC colonies. They can be recognized by their typical “cobblestone-like” morphology (Figure 1A). Between 3‒5 EC-colonies appear in each sample.\nChange the medium every other day for another 5‒7 days until individual EC colonies start to touch one another.\nManual isolation of individual EC colonies\n\t\nTo harvest EC colonies, wash the plate with 5 mL of PBS and manually aspirate with a serological pipette.\nTake the plate to a microscope and circle the locations of multiple EC colonies using a marking pen both on lid and bottom before returning it to laminar flow hood.\nDetach EC colonies by pipetting 50 µL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA solution on the marked areas.\nUsing a small cell scraper or a pipette tip, gently scrape cells from plate.\nTilt the plate to the nearest edge, and rinse with 1 mL of EGM per marked area and collect cells.\nCount the number of cells using a hemocytometer or automated cell counter.\nPlate the collected EC colonies at a density of 1 x 104 cells/cm2 onto fibronectin-coated (1 µg/cm²) cell culture dishes containing fresh EGM. The next day, change medium to complete EGM.\nChange the medium to complete EGM every other day for 2‒3 weeks until cells reach 80% confluency.\nTrypsinize EC with 2 mL of pre-warmed 0.05% trypsin-EDTA per 100 mm dish at 37 °C for 2 min and neutralize trypsin by adding 4 mL of EGM.\nCollect the cell suspension into one 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 400 x g at RT for 5 min. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend cells in 2 mL of EGM.",
    "Count the number of cells using a hemocytometer or automated cell counter. Typical cell numbers obtained are 1 x 106 cells per 60 mm cell culture plate or 2 x 106 cells per 100 mm tissue culture plate.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 400 x g at RT for 5 min and aspirate the supernatant. Proceed to step 3.2.1.\n3. Endothelial cell selection and expansion\nPreparation of anti-CD31-conjugated magnetic beads\n\t\nVortex the vial containing the anti-CD31-conjugated magnetic beads for 30 s. The number of beads required is 8 x 106 beads/2 x 106 cells.\nWash the desired amount of anti-CD31-conjugated magnetic beads with 1 mL of wash solution containing 0.1% BSA in PBS in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nPlace the microcentrifuge tube in a cell isolation magnet for 1 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and repeat the washing step.\nEndothelial cell purification and plating\n\t\nResuspend cell pellet obtained in 2.4.12 in 500 µL of wash solution containing 0.1% BSA in PBS.\nAdd cell solution to microcentrifuge tube containing magnetic beads and resuspend thoroughly.\nIncubate for 20 min at 4 °C with gentle tilting.\nAdd 500 µL of 0.1% BSA in PBS and mix well.\nPlace the tube on a cell isolation magnet for 1 min.\nGently aspirate all of the liquid, which contains the CD31-negative fraction of cells without touching the beads.\nWash the bead pellet containing the CD31-positive cell fraction with 1 mL of 0.1% BSA in PBS and repeat magnetic separation.\nRepeat washing and magnetic separation step for a minimum of 3 times to purify CD31-positive cell fraction.\nResuspend purified endothelial cells into a 15 mL conical tube and spin down for 5 min at 400 x g at RT.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in 1 mL of EGM.",
    "Add 9 mL of complete EGM onto fibronectin-coated (1 µg/cm²) 100 mm plates and seed 1 mL of cell suspension. Note that some magnetic beads are still attached to the cells in this initial seeding step. Most beads wash away during cell expansion, but small number of beads may persist in early passages.\nIncubate cells at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.\nChange the medium every other day until cells reach 80 % confluency (Figure 1B).\nEndothelial cell expansion\n\t\nOnce cells reach 80 % confluency, detach with 2 mL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA per 100 mm dish at 37 °C for 2 min.\nNeutralize trypsin by adding 4 mL of EGM and collect cells into one 15 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge at 400 x g at RT for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant, resuspend cells in 2 mL of EGM, and count the number of cells with a hemocytometer or by automated cell counting.\nSeed cells at a density of 1 x 104 cells/cm² into 145 mm fibronectin-coated (1 µg/cm²) tissue culture plates.\nContinue to passage cells until the desired cell number has been met. Consider that a confluent 145 mm tissue culture plate contains about 8‒9 x 106 cells and the number of cells needed is 2.5 x 106 cells per injection. Only cells between passage 3 and 8 should be considered for the xenograft.\n4. VM patient-derived xenograft protocol\nNOTE: In this protocol we use 5‒6 week old, male immunodeficient, athymic nude Foxn1nu mice.\nAll animal procedures must be approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\nPreparation of materials on the day before injection\n\t\nPre-chill syringes, needles, and pipet tips in -20 °C freezer overnight.",
    "Slowly thaw the basement membrane extracellular matrix (BMEM) overnight on ice bucket placed at 4 °C to avoid increased viscosity of the gel.\nPreparation of cell suspension for injection\n\t\nTrypsinize EC with 5 mL of pre-warmed 0.05% trypsin-EDTA per 145 mm dish at 37 °C for 2 min.\nNeutralize trypsin by adding 5 mL of EGM and collect cells into one 15 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge at 400 x g at RT for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant, resuspend cells in 3 mL of EGM, and count the number of cells using a hemocytometer or automated cell counter.\nDetermine the total number of cells that are needed for all planned injections.\n\t\tNOTE: The recommended number of cells is 2.5 x 106 cells per injection. A total of 2 injections are typically performed in each mouse for technical duplicates. It is necessary to calculate a 10% excess of cell number to account for loss during transfer into the syringe.\nTransfer the volume containing the calculated cell number into a new 50 mL conical tube and pellet cells by centrifugation at 400 x g at RT for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant, leaving a small volume (about 50‒70 µL) to loosen the pellet.\nSyringe preparation\n\t\nCalculate an excess volume of 20 µL/injection to account for loss during transfer to the syringe. Resuspend the cell pellet with 220 µL of BMEM per injection on ice. The injected volume of cell suspension will be 200 μL per lesion.\nMix the cell suspension thoroughly on ice to obtain a homogenous cell suspension and avoid creating bubbles.\nUsing a 1 mL pipet and 1 mL syringe, simultaneously pipet BMEM-cell mixture into the syringe opening by suction force while pulling plunger of syringe.",
    "Luer lock a 26G x 5/8 inch sterile needle to the syringe and keep prepared syringes flat on ice prior to injection.\nSubcutaneous injection into mouse\n\t\nAnesthetize the mice with 5% isoflurane/oxygen mixture at a flow rate of 1 L/min using an isoflurane vaporizer. Ensure proper sedation of animals (e.g., unresponsiveness to toe pinches). Maintain anesthesia via continuous administration of 1.5% isoflurane/oxygen delivered via nose cone.\nPlace mice on their stomach, exposing the back region where grafting will occur and disinfect the injection region with 70% ethanol.\nGently roll the prepared syringe to resuspend any settled cells. Flick bubbles to the needle end of the syringe and expel a small volume of the cell suspension to ensure the removal of all bubbles.\n\t\tNOTE: Two injections can be performed for each mouse – on the left and the right side of mouse back.\nPinch and create a ‘tent-like’ structure using your thumb and index finger and insert the needle subcutaneously right under the skin. Ensure that the needle is only skin deep by releasing pinched skin to prevent injection into muscle tissue.\nHolding needle at 45° angle carefully inject 200 µL of the cell-suspension to create a small spherical mass (Figure 1C).\nRecord mouse weight with a scale, ear tag the mouse, and return to cage.\nMonitor mice following sedation to ensure they return to normal activity.\nLesion growth monitoring\n\t\nUsing a caliper, measure the length and width of each plug (Figure 1D).\nDocument measurements every other day up until lesion collection.\n5. Tissue collection and processing\nEuthanize mice 9 days post-implantation in a CO2 chamber and check vital signs to confirm death. Perform cervical dislocation on the mice as a secondary method to euthanize the mouse.",
    "Harvest the xenograft lesion/plug from the flank of the mouse by dissection using surgical forceps and scissors.\n\tNOTE: In order to prevent rupturing the blood-filled vessels within the plug, it is important to avoid touching the lesion plug with dissection tools and leave excessive surrounding tissue such as skin attached to the plug.\nImmerse the resected lesion in PBS to wash.\nSet up a camera stage with a camera. Align plugs onto a cutting board with a ruler. Take an image of all plugs to record gross vascularity of lesions (Figure 1E).\nFix plugs by submerging in 10% formalin overnight at RT.\nWash plugs in PBS the following day and move them into 70% ethanol.\nProcess lesion plugs for paraffin embedding (pathology core).\n6. Lesion sectioning\nUse a microtome to cut 5 μm sections from the collected murine lesions onto positively charged slides.\n\tNOTE: For the subsequent analysis, sections in the center of the plug (about 50‒70 µm into the tissue) are of importance.\nMelt paraffin at 60 °C for 1 h prior to staining.\nDe-paraffinize and re-hydrate tissue sequentially under a chemical fume flow hood. Therefore, incubate slide in xylene for 10 min, 100% ethanol (EtOH) for 5 min, 90% EtOH for 3 min, and 80% EtOH for 3 min.\nRinse slide in deionized water for 5 min.\n7. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)\nIncubate sections in Hematoxylin for 2 min.\nPlace slides in a staining jar and rinse in a sink by a steady stream of tap water until water is clear.\nDe-hydrate slides by incubating tissue sequentially in 70% EtOH for 1 min, 80% EtOH for 1 min, 90% EtOH for 1 min, 100% EtOH for 1 min, and fresh 100% EtOH for 1 min.\nStain sections in Eosin Y for 30 s.",

Immunohistochemistry\nPrepare antigen retrieval buffer (Tris-EDTA) by weighing 0.6 g of Tris-base and 1 mL of 0.5 M EDTA to 500 mL of deionized water. Adjust pH to 9.0 using 1 M HCl. Add 250 µL of Tween-20.\nIncubate de-paraffinized tissue slides (as obtained in step 6.2‒6.3) in a beaker with antigen retrieval buffer, stirring on a heating block, for 20 min at 95 °C.\nRemove the beaker from heating block, allow solution to cool to 35 °C then wash in PBS for 3 min.\nBlock tissue sections in 5% normal horse serum in PBS for 30 min at RT.\nPrepare a biotinylated Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I (UEA-I) working solution by diluting 20 µg/mL of biotinylated UEA-I in 5% normal horse serum in PBS.\nPipet 50‒100 µL of UEA-I working solution per section and incubate for 1 h at RT in a humidifying chamber.\nWash slides two times in PBS for 3 min.\nQuench slide sections in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 5 min at RT.\nWash slides two times in PBS for 3 min.\nPrepare 5 µg/mL of Streptavidin horseradish peroxidase-conjugated in 5% normal horse serum in PBS.\nPipet 50‒100 µL on each tissue slide and incubate for 1 h at RT in a humidifying chamber.\nWash slides two times in PBS for 3 min.\nPrepare 3,3'Diaminobenzidine (DAB) solution according to manufacturer’s instructions and add 50‒100 µL per section.\nIncubate sections for 10‒15 min, checking and monitoring for development of stain every 2‒5 min.",
    "Wash slides three times in PBS for 3 min.\nAdd a drop of Hematoxylin and incubate for 3 min.\nPlace slides in a staining jar and rinse in a sink by a steady stream of tap water until water is clear.\nSequentially incubate slide in 80% EtOH for 1 min, 90% EtOH for 1 min, 100% EtOH for 1 min, and xylene for 2 min.\nLet slides dry for 5‒10 min under the fume hood.\nDispense a drop of permanent, non-aqueous mounting medium over xenografts sections and place coverslip on top.\nAllow slides to dry overnight before imaging.\n9. Analysis of human-derived Vascular Channels\nNOTE: Vascularity of VM lesions is quantified by measuring vascular area and vascular density. Only UEA-I positive, human-derived vascular channels are considered for quantification.\nTake four to five images per lesion section with a bright field microscope at a 20x magnification (high power fields [HPF]). Take HPF images in an x-plane pattern within the lesion section to avoid overlap (Figure 1F-H). Include a scale bar on the images taken.\nOpen the HPF images in Image J (File > Open). Calibrate the pixels of the scale bar as follows. Use the straight line tool and go over the scale bar. To convert the measured pixels into mm click on Analyze > Set scale.\nClick on Analyze > Set Measurements and select Area and Add to overlay.\nMeasure the total field area in a HPF using Analyze > Measure. Save this measurement for quantification in step 9.8.\nUsing the freehand selections tool, manually outline UEA-I+ vascular channels.\n\tNOTE: A vascular channel is defined as any area that is lined with UEA-I+ - EC that may contain blood cells.\nClick on Analyze > Measure to quantify the outlined UEA-I+ vascular area (mm2/HPF).",
    "Repeat this measurement for all five HPF taken within one plug.\nAverage the total vascular area of all five HPF. The obtained vascular area per HPF is subsequently divided by the HPF field area (in mm2, step 9.5) and expressed as a percent (%).\nFor quantification of vascular density, count the number of UEA-I+ vascular channels of each HPF taken. The vascular density is the average number of UEA-I+ vascular channels counted per HPF area (vessels/mm2).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
