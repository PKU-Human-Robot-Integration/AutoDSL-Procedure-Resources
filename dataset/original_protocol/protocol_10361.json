    "Caution: Please consult biological safety protocols and all relevant material safety data sheets (MSDS) before use. The laser employed in these experiments is a Class 3B laser; compliance with local rules for a safe use of the system is required. Please use all appropriate safety practices when performing a laser spectroscopy measurement including the use of personal protective equipment (safety goggles).\nTail tendons were obtained from 7-8 week old Wistar rats euthanized for other purposes in accordance with EU regulation 1099/2009 and The Welfare of Animals (slaughter or killing) Regulations 1995. Bovine nuchal ligaments were obtained from a local abattoir.\n1. Preparation of Sample Fibers\nNOTE: Protein fibers of the extracellular matrix can be extracted from various tissues, using different procedures. Protocols were refined based on widely applied procedures.\nExtraction of collagen fibers from rat tail\nSacrifice a rat by intra-peritoneal injection of 100 mg/kg of body weight sodium pentobarbitone. Then sever the tail directly at the point of contact with the body, pressing down with a single-edge razor blade. Wrap the tail in cling film and store it frozen at -20 °C until required.\nCollect the tail from the freezer, cut a 20 mm long segment from the proximal end whilst still frozen and then leave it to thaw in a Petri dish filled with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution (pH 7.4) at RT.\nOnce the tail is thawed, make an incision along the length of the segment using a scalpel to split the skin. Then peel back to reveal four sheathed tendon bundles about the tail vertebra.",
    "Using fine forceps and being careful not to apply any pre-strain, gently draw each fiber out of the sheath and place it in a vial containing distilled water with 0.01% w/v sodium azide (NaN3) to prevent bacterial growth, and store refrigerated. A single tail yields around thirty tendon fibers.\nTo obtain pure fibrous type I collagen, apply a three part enzymatic digestion process10 to the tendon fibers to remove the proteoglycans and all other noncollagenous material.\n\t\t\nFirst, immerse the fibers in 0.125 U/ml chondroitinase ABC in 0.05 M Tris buffer and 0.06 M sodium acetate (CH3COONa) at pH 8.0 for 24 hr at 37 °C in a shaking incubator at 200 rpm.\nThen, immerse the fibers in 1 U/ml streptomyces hyaluronidase in 0.05 M Tris buffer and 0.15 M sodium chloride (NaCl) at pH 6.0 and return to the shaking incubator for 24 hr at 37 °C.\nFinally, immerse the fibers in 1 mg/ml of trypsin in 0.05 M sodium phosphate (NaHPO4) and 0.15 M NaCl at pH 7.2 for 16 hr in the shaking incubator at 37 °C.\nStore the purified fibers refrigerated in vials containing distilled water, with 0.01% NaN3 to prevent bacterial growth, until required for measurement.\nExtraction of elastin fibers from bovine nuchal ligament\nObtain bovine nuchal ligament from the abattoir, wrap it in cling film and store it frozen at -20 °C until use.\nTo produce pure elastin, collect the ligament from the freezer, allow it to thaw at RT, defat it using a scalpel and digest the ligament in a boiling water bath according to the Lansing procedure,11 as follows.\n\t\t\nPrepare a 0.1 M solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in distilled water and add it to the defatted ligament in a conical flask, covering the tissue.",
    "Boil the flask in a water bath at 95 °C for 45 min.\nRemove the ligament from the digestion flask and wash the insoluble tissue block repeatedly in distilled water until pH 7.0 (monitored using a pH meter) is obtained.\nRemove the tissue from the final wash solution and submerge it in distilled water (mixed with 0.01% NaN3 to prevent bacterial growth) in a sealed container and store it refrigerated.\nCollect the tissue from the refrigerator and, being careful not to apply too much force and pre-strain, use tweezers to gently pull smaller elastin segments (20 to 50 mm long, ca. 2 mm thick) away from the larger block and place them in a Petri dish with PBS solution (pH 7.4).\nUsing fine forceps, gently tease small fiber bundles around 1 mm thick and cut them to lengths of a few mm using a scalpel.\nTransfer the fibers to vials containing distilled water (with 0.01% NaN3 to prevent bacterial growth) and store them refrigerated until required for measurement.\nMounting the fibers onto reflective substrate\nUsing a diamond cutter, cut a piece of reflective silicone slide.\nTo create a hydrated compartment, cut a strip of Parafilm to fit over the silicone slide with a hollow cut in the center (large enough to fit a fiber) and place it onto the silicone substrate.\n\t\tNOTE: For dry fiber measurements, cut the parafilm into a U-shape so that one of the four sides stays open to the air when sealed in step 1.3.4.",
    "Remove the fibers from the refrigerator, use a pair of fine forceps to collect a single fiber from the storage solution and place it in a small Petri dish filled with pure water at RT for 5 min to wash the sample. Then, collect the fiber and transfer it to the center of the parafilm hollow on the silicone substrate.\n\t\tCareful: Avoid damaging the fiber by stretching it during this operation, and avoid reorienting the sample on the substrate as this may cause a change in mechanical properties.\nPlace a thin glass coverslip over the fiber and seal the chamber by passing a heated soldering iron gently over the glass surface to melt the parafilm beneath the glass.\n\t\tCareful: Avoid damaging the fiber by not bringing the soldering tip too close or heating the substrate excessively.\nPlace the sealed chamber on a flat surface under a small weight and leave it for around 12 hr to achieve a good contact between the sample and silicon substrate while avoiding damage to the specimen.\nRemove the weight and secure the chamber in place on the substrate, using screws.\n2. Setting up the Brillouin Experiment and Acquiring Fiber Spectra\nPreparation of sample compartment\nMount the sample prepared as in part 1.3 onto a vertical holder equipped with a goniometer to enable in-plane rotation of the sample while maintaining a constant scattering angle (2Φ = 90°; see Figure SI-1) and scattering volume position.\nPerform an accurate focus adjustment of the laser light on the sample through the lens.9",
    "Careful: The laser output power may be too high and produce a burn in the sample. Make sure that it is set sufficiently high to give a good sensitivity but not too high to avoid damage to the sample. Here we used a power of ca. 76 mW on the sample. This was sufficient to get a good sensitivity without burning the sample, also considering that this is thin and in contact with a substrate that helps dissipating the heat generated by laser illumination.\nPosition the sample at a 45° angle (Φ) to the incident laser beam using a Vernier scale. Achieve optimal positioning by running a measurement and maximizing the intensity of the peaks in the spectrum (see below).\nSetting up the spectrometer\nOpen the software for acquisition and manipulation of the data and set up the acquisition of a Brillouin spectrum of the sample12. The procedure described here applies to the multipass tandem interferometer (Figure SI-1A).\nAlign the two Fabry-Perot (FP) interferometers independently changing the voltages applied to the piezo by the control unit. For this pre-alignment procedure, observe the light reflected by each FP. When the intensity reflected by the two FPs tends to zero, the correct alignment is reached.\nCalibrate the spectrum: the accessible frequency range, or free spectral range (FSR), is dependent on the distance between the two mirrors of the first FP cavity, L, through FSR = c/2L, where c is the speed of light and L is measured by a dial-gauge.\nSynchronize the scans of the two FP interferometers and switch the optical system to the tandem multipass configuration. A feedback control of the transmitted laser light intensity will automatically maintain the alignment of the two FPs during the measurement.\nMeasurement of Brillouin Spectra",
    "Careful: The Brillouin spectrum is highly dependent on the temperature and hydration of the sample and so careful control of these parameters is key to obtaining reproducible spectra.\n\t\nStart the acquisition of a Brillouin spectrum of the sample and run it until a good signal-to-noise ratio is achieved. This may take several minutes depending on the scattering cross section, concentration and thickness of the sample.\n\t\tNOTE: There is not a rule of thumb for the signal-to-noise ratio but the spectral quality is checked by the experimentalist based on the specific sample analyzed. There is a trade-off between spectral quality and duration of the measurement, therefore the experimental parameters need to be selected according to the specific application.\nFor the measurement of a dry specimen, take successive spectra — for each of them, following step 2.3.1 — until no changes in the position of the peaks is observed. This is achieved when the sample is at equilibrium with the room atmosphere and no further drying will affect the spectrum.\nSelect the light polarization (VV or VH; V stands for vertical and H for horizontal direction of the light polarization relative to the scattering plane) and acquire spectra at each angle to fiber axis (θ ; Figure SI-1) by rotating the sample in plane by hand.\nSave the Brillouin spectra to file for subsequent processing.\n3. Analysis of Brillouin Spectra\nNOTE: Fit analysis of Brillouin peaks can be performed using various functions. A damped harmonic oscillator (DHO) function4,13 was selected as this is a valid model for peaks originating from damped acoustic modes in viscoelastic media.\nFit analysis of Brillouin peaks\nSelect the spectral range for the peak of interest in the Brillouin spectrum.\nEnable a baseline in the fit if the spectral background is much higher than zero.",
    "NOTE: The baseline can vary between spectra. Ensure that the correction is applied in a systematic and reproducible manner.\nApply a detailed least squares fitting using a DHO function4,13 to the Brillouin peak of interest iteratively until convergence is achieved and the best fitting curve is obtained. Then, save the fit results to file.\nObtain average values from the fit parameters of the two peaks of each Brillouin doublet.\nCalculate the acoustic wave velocity from the peak frequency (using the expression below).\nPlot the fit results through graphs, e.g., acoustic wave velocity vs. angle to fiber axis, θ , and apply relevant models (e.g., for acoustically anisotropic systems9) to extract mechanical quantities such as elasticity tensor coefficients."
