    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPrepare protein fractions for MS analysis\nMethod 1: Ultrafiltration and in-solution digest\nTiming: 2 days\nWe use two different methods for reduction/alkylation and trypsin digestion of samples in 96-well plates for MS analysis (outlined in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). If your sample contains >300 mM salt, then use Method 1 directly below. If your sample contains <300 mM salt, then use Method 2.\nBuffer exchange and sample concentration.\nUse a vacuum manifold and vacuum of up to −24 Hg for all plate conditioning and sample concentration steps. Wash any preservatives or wetting agents from a 3k MWCO AcroPrep Advance 96 filter plate (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) by adding a 300-μL volume of LC/MS-grade H2O and pulling it through the membrane using vacuum. Then condition the filter plate by adding a 300-μL volume of Trypsin Digestion Buffer and pulling the solution through the membrane using vacuum.\nNote: If all 96 wells are not required place a sealing film over unused wells. The plate can be saved after use, and the unused wells uncovered for use at a later date.\nNote: Throughout all washes and subsequent steps do not let the wells dry out or proteins may stick irreversibly to the membrane.\nStop the vacuum and shake excess liquid from the washed plate.\nTransfer your samples to the washed AcroPrep plate. Apply vacuum to the 96-well filter plate to reduce the sample volume to ~100 μL.\nNote: Samples will flow through the filter-plate wells at variable rates due to varied macromolecular content. Monitor the liquid volumes throughout filtration and add Trypsin Digestion Buffer to samples as necessary to prevent rapidly flowing wells from drying before all wells are adequately concentrated.",
    "Add a 100-μL volume of Trypsin Digestion Buffer to all wells, and mix using several aspirate and dispense cycles of a pipette.\nContinue vacuum filtration to reduce the sample volume to ~ 50 μL.\nTransfer concentrated samples back into the original deep well plate for digestion.\nReduction/Alkylation\nTo the 50-μL volume of sample, add a 50-μL volume of 100% TFE.\nNote: Even if your sample volume is >50-μL do NOT add more than a 50-μL volume of 100% TFE, or the final concentration at the digestion step could inhibit trypsin activity.\nAdd a sufficient volume of the 0.5 M TCEP stock for a final concentration of 5 mM in each sample well, seal the plate with clear film, and incubate for 30 min at 37°C.\nPlace the plate at room temperature (20°C–25°C) and add a sufficient volume of the 550 mM iodoacetamide stock for a final concentration of 15 mM in each sample well.\nSeal the plate and incubate for 30 min in the dark, and at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nNote: Iodoacetamide is light sensitive and reactive in aqueous solution. We generally store small aliquots of the 550 mM stock solution of iodoacetamide in water at −20°C. These are thawed directly prior to use in this protocol. Alternatively, a fresh stock can be made from powder directly before use.\nQuench the unreacted iodoacetamide by the addition of a sufficient volume of the 1 M DTT stock for a final concentration of 7.5 mM in each sample well.\nDigestion\nAdd ~880-μL volume of the Trypsin Digestion Buffer to bring each sample to a final volume of 1 mL, this dilution reduces the TFE concentration to less than 5%.\nAdd a 10 μL volume (1 μg of enzyme) of a proteomics-grade Trypsin stock solution in 10 mM acetic acid to each well.",
    "Seal the plate with clear film and digest overnight (12–16 h) at 37°C.\nStop the protein digestion by the addition of a sufficient volume of formic acid for a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v) per sample well.\nDesalting and Peptide recovery\nNote: This step uses the solid-phase C18 Lab-in-a-Plate device indicated in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]. As with the ultrafiltration plates, unused wells should be covered with sealing film during plate use so that they may be saved for future use.\nCondition each utilized well of the C18 Lab-in-a-Plate using vacuum filtration as follows:\nAdd a 100-μL volume of the 60% Buffer B per well and vacuum through. Repeat a second time.\nAdd a 100-μL volume of Buffer A per well and vacuum through. Repeat 3–4 times.\nAdd the 1-mL volume of each sample to an individual conditioned well on the plate, and apply vacuum to filter the samples through.\nWash the wells by adding a 100-μL volume of Buffer A, and apply vacuum to filter. Repeat 2 more times.\nNote: If your sample initially had very high salt add some additional Buffer A washes here to thoroughly de-salt the sample prior to peptide elution for LC/MS analysis.\nPlace a 96-well collection plate into the appropriate vacuum manifold adaptor to collect the eluate.\nCritical: Strong vacuum can lead to bubbling/foaming of the eluting liquid causing cross-contamination of samples so pay attention at this step and adjust the vacuum accordingly. Elution at <−15 Hg is recommended. Alternatively, samples can be eluted by using gentle centrifugation (<1,000 × g) in a swinging bucket rotor equipped with microplate adaptors. During centrifugation, the C18 plate is directly seated on top of the collection plate.",
    "Elute the digested peptides into the collection plate using a 50-μL volume of 60% Buffer B per well. Repeat the elution step a second time for a total eluate volume of 100 μL.\nEvaporate the eluate solvent in a vacuum centrifuge to dryness. This step takes approximately 3 h.\nPause Point: If you will not be able to load samples onto a MS system within ~24 h these samples can be stored dry, sealed with adhesive foil at −80°C.\nFor LC/MS analysis, resuspend peptides in a 20- to 35-μL volume of Buffer C per well, pipette up and down several times, and transfer the reconstituted sample to the appropriate sample vial or plate for your autosampler system.\nNote: We use Waters deep 96-well plates appropriate to our autosampler with a pre-slit silicone cap-mat as listed in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]. A 5-μL volume of each sample is sufficient for LC/MS analysis using the mass spectrometry parameters described below. Unused sample can be stored for a period of weeks to months at −80°C in sealed plates, but solvent may evaporate.\nPrepare protein fractions for MS analysis\nMethod 2: Bead binding and on-bead digest\nMethod 2 for reduction/alkylation and trypsin digestion can be used if your sample contains < 300 mM salt. Otherwise you must use Method 1 (see step 1 above).\nCritical: Ensure that bottom of wells can make good contact with the magnetic slab (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] if modification of the deep well plate is required). Have aliquots of beads prepared as described below.\nPrepare SpeedBead slurry for Method 2\nTiming: 45 min\nCompletely resuspend each of the 2 types of commercial beads (hydrophilic and hydrophobic, see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) provided as a 50 mg/mL slurry containing preservative (0.05% sodium azide). Be thorough with vortex-mixing and pipetting to ensure homogeneity.",
    "Combine 50 μL of each commercial bead suspension in a single 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and mix well.\nCollect the beads by low-speed pulse centrifugation in a microfuge and remove and discard the supernatant.\nWash the beads by thorough resuspension in 1 mL LC/MS-grade H2O.\nRepeat steps 7 and 8.\nCollect the beads as in step 7 and resuspend in a 500-μL volume of LC/MS-grade H2O for a working microparticle dispersion density of 10 μg/μL total (5 μg/μL of each bead type). This slurry can be aliquoted for ease of resuspension, and stored at 4°C (do not freeze) for at least 6 months. Resuspend beads thoroughly before each use.\nProcess sample using Method 2\nTiming: 2 days\nReduction and alkylation\nTo each well containing your samples add 100% TFE to achieve 20% TFE final concentration and mix by pipetting.\nAdd a sufficient volume of the 0.5 M TCEP stock for a final concentration of 5 mM in each sample well.\nSeal the plate with adhesive film and incubate 45 min at 37°C.\nPlace the plate at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nAdd a sufficient volume of the 550 mM iodoacetamide stock for a final concentration of 25 mM in each sample well (see note at step 2d above).\nIncubate for 30 min in the dark at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nQuench reactivity by the addition of a sufficient volume of the 1 M DTT stock for a final concentration of 12 mM in each sample well.\nBead binding of proteins\nTo each fraction add a 4-μL volume of bead suspension. The bead suspension is a stock slurry comprising a 1:1 mix of 5 μg/mL each of the two bead types (hydrophobic and hydrophilic) listed in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table].",
    "Add a sufficient volume of formic acid for a final concentration of 2% (v/v), and a sufficient volume of acetonitrile for final solvent proportion of 50% (v/v) and mix well by pipetting. These two ingredients can be made into a premix for easier dispensing.\nMix gently but thoroughly by pipetting.\nIncubate for 30 min with gentle shaking or rocking to keep beads from settling.\nCritical: incubation for prolonged periods of time does not help and may reduce recovery.\nCollect beads from this large volume by brief centrifugation (e.g., 5 min at 1,000 × g) in a swinging bucket rotor equipped with deep well plate adaptors.\nPlace the sample plate on the magnetic plate. Remove and discard the bulk of the liquid leaving behind the beads and approximately a 250-μL volume of liquid.\nTake the sample plate off the magnetic plate. Resuspend the beads in the remaining liquid and transfer them to a fresh 450 μL conical bottom, 96-well plate to facilitate the remaining steps.\nPlace this shallow plate on the magnetic plate. Once beads have collected to the bottom, remove and discard the remaining liquid.\nNote: beads will vary in appearance from rust color when diffuse to darker brown when compact, and appear more aggregated or dispersed depending on protein content and other unknown parameters. None of these appearances indicates failure to bind proteins.\nKeep the sample plate on the magnetic plate for all the following wash steps and work rapidly. Pipette carefully to avoid losing beads. The washes need not resuspend the bead pellet.\nWash with a 100-μL volume of 70% ethanol per well. Repeat this wash step a second time.\nWash with a 100 μL volume of acetonitrile. Repeat this wash step a second time.\nAir dry the beads briefly.\nOn-bead digestion of proteins",
    "Remove the sample plate from the 96-well magnetic separator plate, and resuspend the beads in a 25-μL volume of the 10% TFE prepared in Trypsin Digestion Buffer solution.\nNote: Do not be concerned if beads appear “chunky” or aggregated at this stage.\nDilute enough trypsin stock solution with trypsin digestion buffer for the next step.\nTo each sample add a 25-μL volume of Trypsin Digestion Buffer that contains 0.25 μg of proteomics-grade Trypsin.\nSeal the plate with adhesive film and incubate overnight (12–16 h) at 37°C.\nPeptide recovery\nPlace the sample plate on the magnet. Once the beads have collected transfer the bead-free supernatant to a fresh 96-well plate.\nTo the transferred volume add a sufficient volume of formic acid for a final concentration of 1% (v/v) to stop protein digestion.\nNote: Formic acid is very volatile and corrosive to metal parts of pipettors (e.g., plungers) at concentrations >10%. If you are pipetting undiluted formic acid we recommend using positive displacement pipettors.\nRemove the plate from the 96-well magnetic plate separator, and elute peptides from the beads with the addition of a 50-μL volume of a 2% DMSO solution.\nNote: If possible, cover samples with adhesive film and sonicate 5 min in a bath sonicator to assist elution at this point.\nReplace the plate on the 96-well magnetic plate separator to collect the beads. Remove each sample eluate and add it to the corresponding supernatant from step 14a.\nRemove the plate from the magnet and elute the beads with another 50-μL volume of a 2% DMSO solution (no sonication necessary).\nReplace the bead plate on the magnetic plate separator. Remove this second volume of eluate and pool it with the first corresponding matched eluate for a total volume of 150 μL for each fraction.",
    "Desalting of the eluted peptides is identical to that in Method 1 (step 4) with the only difference being the sample volumes loaded on the conditioned solid-phase C18 Lab-in-a-Plate are 150 μL instead of 1 mL.\nLC/MS system and acquisition conditions\nTo maximize its generality, this protocol was explicitly designed to work with CF/MS data collected using different LC/MS equipment and analysis protocols, including both label and label-free protein quantification. In practice, we frequently use the following LC/MS setup:\nPeptides are separated using reverse phase chromatography on a Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano UHPLC system with a C18 trap to Acclaim C18 PepMap RSLC column configuration. We typically employ a data-dependent acquisition strategy on either a Thermo Orbitrap Elite, Orbitrap Fusion, or Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer. If using an Orbitrap Fusion or Lumos, we elute peptides with a 3%–45% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% formic acid over 60 min, and if using a less sensitive machine (Orbitrap Elite) we employ a longer gradient separation, e.g., 5%–40% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% formic acid over 120 min.
