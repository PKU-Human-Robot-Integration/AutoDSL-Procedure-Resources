See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nNote: In our experience, 50 μL of Ketamine/Xylazine cocktail is well tolerated by mice during intraperitoneal injection. If needed 100 μL of Ketamine/Xylazine cocktail can be administered to induce sleep and loss of toe pinch response.\nFor mice with fur, shave hair in the chest area using hair trimmer or remove hair using hair removal cream to identify injection point and obtain better bioluminescent images.\nNote: In our hands, compared to shaving, hair removal cream is more effective and faster.\nPost anesthesia, put the mouse on its back with chest facing up on a flat surface and stretch forelimbs and hind limbs and restrict any movement using paper tape (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1600-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Image showing mice positioning and intracardiac injection site\nCritical: Be careful not to over stretch the animal as it could physically injure the animal.\nWipe the chest using Webcol and mark the injection spot targeting left ventricle (the front and middle of the chest, slightly left of the sternum between sternal notch and top of xiphoid process, (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nDraw 100 μL of cells into 26G tuberculin syringe slip tip with intradermal bevel needle. Create an air space between plunger and meniscus to see cardiac pulse.\nNote: Mix cells in Eppendorf tube using 1 mL pipette before drawing cells into syringe. This process helps uniform distribution of cells and prevents clumping.",
    "Hold the syringe upright and insert needle in the marked spot and check for the blood flow into the syringe. Press the plunge slowly and inject cells into the heart. See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nNote: To avoid heart puncture, remove the needle in straight position.\nRemove the tape and let the mouse recover on heat pad for 5 min.\nRetro-orbitally inject 100 μL of 50 mM D-luciferin.\nCheck the distribution of cells by BLI imaging with exposure time of 30–60 s.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1600-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic diagram illustrating steps to establish and collect brain metastatic lesions for metabolite analysis\nNote: Uniform BLI signal should be detected throughout the mice body (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nWeekly bioluminescence imaging (BLI) analysis to assess metastatic progression\nTiming: Approximately 5–10 min per mouse\nMeasure metastatic incidence using BLI imaging every week or every two weeks.\nAnesthetize animals using isoflurane in anesthesia induction chamber. Plan number of animals to anesthetize depending on the capacity of the imaging system and the anesthesia chamber.\nNote: Animals can be anesthetized using ketamine/xylazine solution as described earlier. However, frequent use of ketamine/xylazine can impact animal health.\nPost anesthesia, inject 100 μL of D-luciferin through retro-orbital sinus.\nPlace mice nose into the nose cone of the imaging system platform.\nObtain BLI image with exposure time of 30–60 s. Look for signal in brain or organ of interest. If signal is saturated, reduce exposure time.\nNote: For tracking weekly metastatic progression using BLI signal, keep exposure time constant.\nDetermine whole body average photon flux and brain only photon flux using image analysis software. Mice are ready for isotope tracing once the average brain only or whole-body radiance is more than 106 p/sec/cm2/sr.\nNote: Brain metastatic lesions are usually observed 5–6 weeks post-intracardiac injection.\nIsotope infusion in mice with brain metastatic lesions",
    "Timing: Approximately 6–7 h per mouse\nPreparing mice for 13C-glucose and glutamine infusion.\nFast mice 12–16 h for 13C-glucose and 13C-glutamine infusion. Fasting mice results in higher fractional enrichment of 13C-glucose in plasma. However, 13C-glutamine infusion can be done in mice without fasting.\nNote: We observed no significant differences in fractional enrichment of glutamine in plasma upon fasting.\nAnesthetize mice by injecting intraperitoneally 30 mg/mL of ketamine/xylazine (50 μL) and later with 20 mg/mL of ketamine hydrochloride (50 μL).\nPlace a 20-gauge catheter in the lateral tail vein of each anesthetized mouse.\n13C6-glucose infusion in mice.\nFor glucose tracing, infuse 13C6-glucose intravenously as a bolus of 0.6 mg/g body mass over 1 min in 150 μL of saline using a programmable multi syringe holding pump system.\nNext, infuse bolus of 0.0138 mg/g body mass per minute for 3–4 h (in a volume of 150–200 μL/h) using same procedure (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). See troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\n13C5-glutamine infusion in mice.\nFor glutamine tracing, infuse 13C5-glutamine as a bolus of 0.2125 mg/g body mass over 1 min in 150 μL of saline.\nNext, infuse bolus of 0.004 mg/g body mass per minute for 5–6 h (in a volume of 150–200 μL/h) using a programmable multi syringe holding pump system. See troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nNote: Monitor mice continuously throughout the infusion experiment (3 h for glucose infusion, and 5 h for glutamine infusion).\nCritical: Fasted mice should be hydrated enough and must be kept on warm pad throughout the time of experiment.\nTo determine fractional enrichment of 13C-labeled metabolite in plasma over the course of infusion, collect blood every hour by retro-orbital puncture into an EDTA tube. Label and keep the tubes on ice.\nCritical: If mice appear weak, blood can be collected once every two hours.",
    "Note: Sodium heparin or Sodium citrate tubes can be used for this process.\nPost infusion, inject 100 μL of D-luciferin through retro-orbital sinus and obtain bioluminescent image to locate brain metastatic lesion.\nNote: Prior to intracardial perfusion, D-luciferin injection is critical to detect brain metastatic lesion ex vivo.\nPerform intracardial perfusion using 15–20 mL of 1× PBS in syringe connected to 23G butterfly needle.\nPost perfusion, isolate the brain carefully by removing the skull and obtain ex vivo brain bioluminescent image using IVIS machine. Identify metastatic lesion using BLI signal (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nCollect and process brain metastatic lesions for metabolite analysis\nTiming: Approximately 1–2 h\nNote: Metastatic lesions from several mice (n≅5) need to be analyzed to increase robustness and account for variability.\nBased on the observed signal approximate the region of metastatic lesion in the brain. Resect BLI+ brain metastatic lesion using surgical blades and verify BLI signal in the resected metastatic lesion using IVIS imager. See troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nCritical: The isolated BLI positive tissue is likely to contain primarily tumor cells along with few brain resident cells. Minimize number of non-tumor cells in the collected tissue by precisely cutting only regions with high BLI signal. As controls pick BLI negative region within the brain and from the same region in mice with no brain metastasis.\nFlash freeze collected tissues in liquid nitrogen and store at −80°C.\nHomogenize 30–50 mg of metastatic lesion using an electronic tissue disruptor (Qiagen) in 1 mL chilled 80% methanol (LC-MS grade, Fisher Scientific). See troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nNote: A minimum of 15 mg of tissue is required for further processing.\nSubject the homogenized solution three freeze-thaw cycles using liquid nitrogen and 37°C water bath.\nCentrifuge samples at 13,000 g for 10 min to precipitate macromolecules.\nCollect supernatant carefully and lyophilize using Speed-Vac (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).",
    "imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1600-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Schematic illustration showing metabolite extraction and analysis procedures\nProcess blood samples for metabolite analysis\nTiming: Approximately 1 h\nBlood samples stored on ice were centrifuged at 2,500 g at 4°C for 10 min.\nNote: This is a time sensitive process, do not store blood samples on ice for more than an hour.\nCollect blood plasma (top yellow layer) carefully and freeze at −80°C.\nAdd 10–15 μL of blood plasma to 80:20 methanol: water and subjected to evaporation using Speed-Vac.\nIn vivo steady-state metabolite profile in brain metastatic lesions\nTiming: Approximately 60–70 min\nFor in vivo steady state metabolite analysis, once the average brain only or whole-body photon flux reached 106–107 p/sec/cm2/sr, mice were subjected to cardiac perfusion post D-luciferin injection and brain was isolated as described earlier.\nUse ex vivo brain BLI signal to mark and surgically remove metastatic lesions.\nNote: The isolated BLI positive tissue is likely to contain primarily tumor cells along with few non-tumor cells. Minimize number of non-tumor cells in the collected tissue by selecting BLI high signal regions. As controls for normalization pick BLI negative region within the brain and from the same region in mice with no brain metastasis.\nFlash freeze tumors in liquid nitrogen and store at −80°C until further processing.\nSample preparation for Mass spectroscopy.\nHomogenize metastatic lesions (30–50 mg) using an electronic tissue disruptor (Qiagen) in 1 mL chilled 80% methanol (LC-MS grade, Fisher Scientific).\nNext, follow three freeze-thaw cycles by using liquid nitrogen and a 37°C water bath.\nCentrifuge samples at 13,000 g for 10 min at 4°C.\nCollect supernatant and lyophilize using a Speed-Vac.\nGas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS)\nTiming: Approximately 60–70 min\nResuspend lyophilized samples with 40–60 μL of anhydrous pyridine containing methoxyamine (10 mg/mL).",
    "Vortex the solution and add it to a pre-ready GC-MS autoinjector vial and heat at 70°C for 10 min.\nNext, add 80–120 μL N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-N-methyltrifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA) derivatization reagent to each vial, vortex to mix and heat vials at 70°C for 1 h.\nPost incubation, inject 1 μL of sample into Agilent 7890 gas chromatograph coupled to mass selective detector Agilent 5975C. See troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11].\nProcess the obtained raw data using maven software with in-house optimized database, and the natural abundance of 13C correction. Export files as spreadsheet (.csv).\nLiquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)\nTiming: Approximately 60–70 min\nResuspend lyophilized samples in 100 μL 80:20 acetonitrile: water solution (HPLC grade). For steady state metabolite analysis, lyophilized samples can be resuspended in 100 μL of 0.1% formic acid in water and added to vials with pre-slit screw caps.\nPerform data acquisition using reverse-phase chromatography on a 1290 UHPLC liquid chromatography (LC) system interfaced to a high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) 6550 iFunnel Q-TOF mass spectrometer (MS) (Agilent Technologies, CA).\nOperate MS in both positive and negative (ESI+ and ESI-) modes. Separate analytes using an Acquity UPLC® HSS T3 column (1.8 μm, 2.1 × 150 mm, Waters, MA).\nKeep the column at 20°C–22°C. Mobile phase A composition is 0.1% formic acid in water and mobile phase B composition is 0.1% formic acid in 100% acetonitrile (ACN).\nThe LC gradient is 0 min: 1% B; 5 min: 5% B; 15 min: 99% B; 23 min: 99% B; 24 min: 1% B; 25 min: 1% B. The flow rate was 250 μL/min. Use 5 μL of sample for injection.",
    "Set ESI source conditions as follows: dry gas temperature 225°C and flow 18 L /minute, fragmentor voltage 175 V, sheath gas temperature 350°C and flow 12 L/min, nozzle voltage 500 V, and capillary voltage +3,500 V in positive mode and −3,500 V in negative.\nSet the instrument to acquire over the full m/z range of 40–1,700 in both modes, with the MS acquisition rate of 1 spectrum per sec in profile format.\nProcess raw data files (.d) using Profinder B.08.00 SP3 software (Agilent Technologies, CA) with an in-house database created using same analysis conditions and determined retention time and accurate mass information on 600 standards from Mass Spectrometry Metabolite Library (IROA Technologies, MA).\nThe in-house database matching parameters were mass tolerance 10 ppm; retention time tolerance 0.5 min. Peak integration result was manually curated in Profinder for improved consistency and exported as a spreadsheet (.csv).\nNext, to analyze the obtained data two different normalizations are necessary.\nNormalization to natural abundance of the isotope13C (1.109%).\nNormalization to infused isotope e.g., glucose or glutamine in blood plasma."
