    "Notes: All work is carried out under sterile conditions using a laminar flow hood. The experiments are carried out with liquid axenic cultures of Dictyostelium discoideum. Strains of D. discoideum are usually provided on plates (e.g., from the Dicty stock center). Before start of the experiments, the amoebae should be brought into liquid culture. Detailed and useful information about culturing Dictyostelium can be found at the homepage of the Dicty stock center, http://dictybase.org/[href=http://dictybase.org/] (Fey et al., 2007).Preculturing of Dictyostelium in cell culture flasks has the advantage that it allows direct inspection of the cultures, but it is also possible to grow the cultures in shaking liquid cultures e.g., in 125 ml Erlenmeyer flasks. This can make it easier to obtain high cell densities in the cultures. Growth of Dictyostelium can be improved if it is supplied with washed heat-killed bacteria. We have previously used overnight cultures of E. coli which were washed by centrifugation, resuspended in SorC and heat-killed at 65 °C for 10 min.In this protocol we used different strains of E. coli. The procedure could be used for other bacteria; in this case bacteria-specific growth conditions, optical densities (OD) for estimation of bacterial cell density etc. should be modified accordingly. Day 1. Start D. discoideum cultureAdd 500 µl of a 2-3 day old D. discoideum culture to 10 ml fresh sterile HL5 in sterile culture flasks.Incubate flasks at 22 °C (without shaking).Day 2(-3). Start bacterial culturesStart bacterial cultures by inoculating 25 ml sterile LB medium with 1% inoculum of E. coli culture (overnight growth) in 125 ml Erlenmeyer flasks.Incubate overnight on a rotary shaker at 37 °C, 200 rpm.Day 3(-4). Survival assayHarvest bacteriaHarvest 1 ml of bacteria by centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 2 min.Remove supernatant by carefully pipetting the liquid without disturbing the pellet.",
    "Resuspend bacterial pellet in 1 ml of 1:4 HL5:SorC solution.Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 2 min.Remove the supernatant and resuspend bacterial pellet in 1 ml of 1:4 HL5:SorC solution.Adjust bacterial density to OD600 of 0.1 (around 108 CFU ml-1).Harvest D. discoideum cellsAdd amoebal culture to 50 ml Falcon tubes and centrifuge at 500 x g for 4 min.Remove supernatant by carefully pipetting the liquid without disturbing the pellet.Resuspend amoebae in 25 ml of 1:4 HL5:SorC solution.Centrifuge at 500 x g for 4 min.Resuspend amoebae in 1:4 HL5:SorC solution.Estimate amoebal density in the suspension by counting in a hemocytometer.Adjust amoebal density to 1 x 106 cells ml-1.Start survival assayAdd 900 µl amoebal suspension (from step C2g) to a number of wells in 24-well culture plates.Note: We use at least 6 replicates for each bacterial strain.Add 100 µl bacterial suspension adjusted to approximately 4.5 x 107 cells ml-1 in order to obtain a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5.To obtain other levels of MOI, the bacterial cell densities can be adjusted accordingly.Prepare a set of replicates with 900 µl amoebal suspension and 100 µl sterile 1:4 HL5:SorC.Note: This treatment serves as a negative control to ensure that the initial amoebal cultures are free from bacteria.For each of the bacterial strains, prepare a set of replicates with 100 µl bacterial suspension and 900 µl 1:4 HL5:SorC solution (without amoebae).Note: This treatment serves as a control for the efficiency of gentamicin to kill extracellular bacteria.Incubate at 22 °C for six hours (without shaking).Add gentamicinTransfer content of each well in the 24-well cell culture plates to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube.Centrifuge at 500 x g for 4 min.Remove supernatant by carefully pipetting the liquid without disturbing the pellet.Add 1 ml SorC buffer.Centrifuge at 500 x g for 4 min.",
    "Remove supernatant by carefully pipetting the liquid without disturbing the pellet.Repeat steps C4d-C4f.Add 1 ml SorC containing 400 µg ml-1 gentamicin.Incubate for 1 h at room temperature.Lyse amoebal cells and count internalized bacteriaCentrifuge at 500 x g for 4 min.Remove supernatant by carefully pipetting the liquid without disturbing the pellet.Add 1 ml SorC buffer.Centrifuge at 500 x g for 4 min.Remove supernatant by carefully pipetting the liquid without disturbing the pellet.Repeat steps C5c-C5e.Add 1 ml of a solution with 0.4% Triton X-100 diluted in SorC buffer.Note: This will lyse the amoebal cells.Mix and prepare 10-fold dilution series of the lysate. The dilutions are performed in SorC buffer using a vortex mixer.Note: Preparation of dilution series and plating should be performed immediately after addition of Triton-X since longer exposure to the solvent may kill bacteria. The most important thing is that the different replicates are exposed for the solvent for approximately the same length of time. Plate 100 µl of relevant dilutions on LB agar plates.Note: We recommend using at least two replicate agar plates per dilution level in order to reduce variability at this step. In our experiment we had relatively low bacterial density so for our lowest dilution we simply plated 100 µl of sample directly from the experimental wells.Incubate for 16 h at 37 °C.Count colonies on agar plates."
