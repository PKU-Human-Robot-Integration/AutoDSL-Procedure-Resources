    "Approval or consent to perform this study was not required since the use of patients' data is not applicable.\n1. Planning procedure\nOpen the planning software and reinsure that the newest version is installed.\nClick on EXPERT to switch the Work mode from EASY to EXPERT.\nClick on NEW on the right sidebar to start a new case planning.\nChoose the Image Source by selecting the folder with the pre-operative DICOM CBCT data.\n\tNOTE: Adjustment of the Hounsfield Units (HU) threshold may be necessary depending on the image quality displayed in the window on the lower left).\nSelect Create Dataset to continue with the planning.\nChoose the type of planning (Maxilla or Mandibula).\nSelect Edit Segmentations to start segmentation of the dental arch.\nSwitch to axial view on the left sidebar.\nSelect Density Measurement to perform this measurement for the higher radiopaque tooth structure and the surrounding less radiopaque states (e.g., air). Average the values (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: The average value is calculated manually; the software does not offer a function for this purpose.\nReturn to 3D Reconstruction on the left sidebar.\nAdjust the lower threshold to the calculated average value (Figure 2A).\nSegment by using the Flood Fill tool. Give a name to the segmentation (Figure 2B).\n\tNOTE: When the Flood Fill tool is selected and active, segmentation is possible with a left-click on the desired area in the 3D Reconstruction view.\nFinish segmentation of the dental arch by selecting Close Module.\nLeft-click on Object > Add > Model Scan.\nSelect Load model scan.\n\tNOTE: A digital surface scan utilizing a suitable intraoral scanner must be created in advance and the data set must be available on the PC as an stl file.\nSelect Align to Other Object.\nSelect the segmentation created in step 1.13 (Figure 2C).",
    "Select three different matching points in the Registration Object and Model Scan respectively or landmark registration by left-clicking on the desired area.\n\tNOTE: Try to spatially distribute the points to enhance the semi-automatic matching of the data. Choosing anatomically prominent regions (cusp tips, marginal ridges) as landmarks will also facilitate the semi-automatic registration process).\nCheck registration in all the planes by manually scrolling through the planes and finish the registration.\n\tNOTE: Manual corrections may be necessary if deviations between CBCT and surface scan are evident (Figure 3).\nPlan access cavity by adding an Implant.\n\tNOTE: The utilized endodontic bur must be added to the implant database beforehand via Extras > Implant Designer > Implant > Import Database. The bur can be imported as a .cdxBackup file as described in the software manufacturer's instructions.\nPlace the bur to the targeted position and check in all the planes by left-clicking and moving (the software provides different planes and views for adequate positioning) (Figure 4A).\n\tNOTE: The bur's long axis should be centered in the visualized root canal space. A cylindric diamond bur with a diameter of 1.0 mm can be used for most access cavity preparations. However, in teeth with narrow roots, a smaller diameter should be considered to provide minimally invasive access to the root canal orifice.\nSelect Object > Add > 3D Model to add the STL File of the marker-tray.\nPlace the tray close to the planned access cavity preparation, make sure there will be no interference during the actual procedure (Figure 4B).\nAdd a Surgical Guide and design the marker tray according to the DNS manufacturer's instruction guide.\nExport the marker tray as an STL file and manufacture it with a 3D-Printer (Figure 4C).",
    "Export the entire planning by selecting Object > Virtual Planning Export > Generic Planning Objects Container format according to the DNS manufacturer's instruction guide.\n2. Access cavity preparation\nImport the planning data to the DNS via the USB.\nSelect the case that is being treated.\nInsert the marker into the 3D-printed marker tray.\nCheck the fit of the marker in the marker tray.\nCheck the fit of the marker tray on the dental arch (Figure 4D).\nInsert the bur into the handpiece that was used for the planning.\nRegister the bur in the bur registration tool according to the DNS manufacturer's instruction (Figure 5A).\nCheck the correct registration by moving the bur to a prominent location (e.g., incisal edge); the DNS should show the tip of the instrument at the exact same position (Figure 5B).\n\tNOTE: If an incorrect bur position is displayed, check the proper fit of the tray on the dentition and the proper fit of the marker in the tray. If necessary, repeat the bur registration. If an incorrect position is still displayed, material distortion might have occurred in the tray fabricating process, and access cavity preparation should not be performed.\nMove the bur to the tooth that will be treated.\n\tNOTE: The DNS will automatically switch to a different view, providing real-time information about the spatial and angular deviation; a depth orientation is also provided on the right side (Figure 5C).\nPerform the access cavity preparation with DNS guidance.\n\t​NOTE: Preparation should be performed intermittently. Debris should be removed from the bur and the access cavity to avoid heat development during preparation.\n3. Treatment evaluation\nGenerate post-operative CBCT imaging with the same CBCT machine settings as done pre-operatively.\nOpen pre-operative planning in the software.\nSelect Edit Segmentations.",
    "Adjust the lower threshold to the calculated average value (see step 1.11).\nSegment the treated tooth by using the Flood Fill tool and give a name to the segmentation.\n\tNOTE: If the tooth has proximal contact, one may have to draw manual segmentation boundaries, Figure 6.\nFinish segmentation by selecting the Close Module option.\nRight-click on the overview column on the left on the segmented tooth and select Convert Into 3D Model.\n\tNOTE: The segmentation will appear as a 3D Model in the overview.\nRight-click on the 3D Model of the segmented pre-operative tooth, and then click on Visualization > Properties. The volume of the tooth will be displayed in mm³.\nOpen a new case.\nImport DICOM Image Data of the post-operative CBCT scan (settings for CBCT imaging should be the same as pre-operative).\nSelect Edit Segmentations.\nAdjust the lower threshold to the same value that was calculated for the pre-operative data.\nSegment the treated tooth by using the Flood Fill tool and give a name to the segmentation.\n\tNOTE: If the tooth has proximal contact, one may have to draw manual segmentation boundaries.\nFinish segmentation by selecting the Close Module option.\nRight-click on the segmented tooth, convert it into 3D Model.\n\tNOTE: The segmentation will appear as a 3D Model in the overview.\nRight-click on the 3D Model of the segmented pre-operative tooth, and then click on Visualization > Properties. The volume of the tooth will be displayed in mm3.\n\tNOTE: The difference between the pre- and the post-operative volume is the volume of substance loss during the access cavity preparation.\nOpen the pre-operative planning.\nImport a Model Scan > Import Segmentation and choose the post-operative tooth segmentation.\nAlign with pre-operative tooth segmentation using landmark registration (see step 1.18).",
    "NOTE: The matching procedure of the pre- and post-operative data is beneficial for visualization but not mandatory for volumetric measurements.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
