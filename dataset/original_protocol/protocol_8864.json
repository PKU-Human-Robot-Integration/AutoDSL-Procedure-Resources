    "Appropriate national and institutional ethics should be obtained before performing animal experiments.\n1. Removal of EDL Muscle and Nerve\nWeigh and deeply anesthetize an adult mouse with inhaled isofluorane using a vaporizer with 5% isofluorane plus a 1.5 L/min oxygen flow rate or a bell jar with isofluorane soaked cotton on the bottom.\nEnsure that the mouse is deeply anesthetized and does not respond to a toe pinch. Quickly decapitate using large, sharpened scissors or a guillotine.\nMake a ventral midline cut through the ribs using scissors and remove the internal organs.\nSkin the animal by grasping the skin from the neck area and pulling it past the feet.\nRemove the legs by cutting above the hips and place the skinned legs into a dish with chilled (4 °C), carbogenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) low calcium, high magnesium bicarbonate buffered saline solution containing in mM: 128 NaCl, 1.9 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 0.85 CaCl2, 6.5 MgSO4, and 10 glucose (pH of 7.4±0.05)16. The low calcium, high magnesium solution inhibits synaptic transmission during the dissection.\nPlace the legs dorsal side up in the dish and pin the legs and hips down using needles or insect pins so that the knee and ankle joints are at a 90° angle. Place a pin on each end of the feet and one pin on each of the anterior and posterior thighs to hold the tissue in place.\nUsing Castroviejo spring scissors, lift up the top layer of muscle on the thighs and make a midline cut to expose the sciatic nerve directly below. The sciatic nerve is located just below the top muscle layer and runs above the femur from its exit near the hips until it branches into the common peroneal and tibial nerve just before the knee joint.",
    "Remove the muscle above the sciatic nerve until the point at which the deep peroneal nerve branch dives into the flexor hallucis longus (FHL) muscle is visible.\nUsing #55 forceps, dissect the connective tissue around the peroneal branch to free it from the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, which are on the medial side of the tibia. Cut the tendons of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles and carefully remove them from under the nerve.\nRemove the superficial muscle on the lateral side of the tibia to expose three distinct tendon bundles at the ankle joint—from medial to lateral: FHL, EDL, and tibialis anterior (TA), with the EDL hidden underneath the TA.\nCut the TA tendon at the ankle joint, lift the TA up and away from the EDL, and cut the muscle near the knee to remove it.\nCut the FHL tendon at the ankle and lift it back to reach the area where the nerve enters the FHL. Cut just below that point and remove ~2/3 of the FHL muscle.\nCut the sciatic nerve as close to the hip joint as possible and gently strip away all nerve branches except for the deep peroneal branch.\nCut the EDL tendons at both the ankle and knee joints using large spring scissors.\nUsing sharp scissors, remove the EDL, the remaining FHL and nerve from the surrounding tissue by cutting through the tibia bone at the knee and midway through the thigh. Cut away the remaining tibia bone so that just the EDL, part of the FHL and nerve remain.\n2. Mounting of the EDL Muscle and Nerve into the Tissue Bath (Figure 1A)",
    "Before the start of the experiment, prepare the tissue bath. Constantly perfuse the bath with oxygenated (100% O2) synthetic interstitial fluid (SIF) containing (in mM) 123 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 0.7 MgSO4, 1.7 NaH2PO4, 2.0 CaCl2, 9.5 NaC6H11O (sodium gluconate), 5.5 glucose, 7.5 sucrose, and 10 N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N′-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES); pH 7.4±0.0517. A flow rate of 15-30 ml/min is recommended. Shown is a commercially available bath of 25 ml capacity with two stimulating electrodes fixed to the bottom of the bath, a mounted tissue post and a mount for a force and length controller (approximate bath dimensions 8.5 cm x 3 cm x 1 cm; for specifications see Table of Materials/Equipment).\nUse the remaining FHL tissue to handle the isolated muscle-nerve and place it into the tissue bath. Place a small piece of sylgard on the bottom of the dish and use an insect pin through the remaining FHL tissue to stabilize the muscle.\nUse 6-0 silk sutures to tie both tendons and affix one end to the tissue post and the other to the lever arm of the force and length controller (see Table of Materials/Equipment for specifications). Use the smallest suture length that is practical. Remove the insect pin and sylgard after you have tied the tendons. NOTE: To facilitate easy connection to the lever arm a small piece of wire can be bent into a “j” shaped hook and fixed into the lever arm with epoxy. The suture can then be tied to the wire instead of threaded into the small hole on the lever arm.",
    "Make suction electrodes from SA 16 glass by first using a glass micropipette puller (Heat = 286, Pull = 0, Velocity = 150, Time = 200); break the tip back and manually grind it on a sharpening stone until there is about a 3 mm taper. Melt the tip using a microforge to the desired tip inner diameter of between 10 - 100 µm depending on the area of nerve one wishes to sample from (see Figures 1B-1C for electrode schematic and Table of Materials/Equipment for product information).\nFill a premade glass suction electrode to the inner silver wire with SIF.\nSuction the cut end of the nerve into the electrode and connect to the positive port of a differential amplifier. Wrap the electrode with a chlorided silver wire that connects to the negative port of the headstage. Ground the SIF bath by running a second chlorided silver wire from the bath to the headstage’s ground port. Also ground the perfusion tubing to the Faraday cage at multiple points to mitigate electrical noise introduced via the perfusion pumps.\nStimulate the muscle via the electrodes mounted on either side of the muscle in the tissue bath to induce a twitch contraction. Alternatively place a stimulating electrode on the cut end of the nerve. Increase the stimulating voltage until a peak contractile force is observed and then increase the voltage by an additional 15% to reach supramaximal voltage (0.5 msec pulse width). Continue the twitch contractions at the supramaximal voltage, with a 10 sec rest in-between, but vary the length of the muscle until a peak contractile force is reached to find the optimal length (Lo) of the muscle. All length ramps and vibrations will start with the muscle at this length.",
    "Allow the muscle-nerve preparation to remain in the bath for at least 1 hr before subsequent data collection to allow the tissue to reach the bath temperature and for normal synaptic transmission to recover following dissection in a low calcium solution.\nTo collect data at a temperature other than room temperature, place a temperature probe into the tissue bath near the muscle. Slowly bring the bath up to temperature by pumping heated water through the tissue bath base plate. Wrap clay microwavable heating pads around the SIF reservoir to help maintain a steady temperature.\n3. Data Collection\nTo identify an afferent as a spindle afferent, record the neuronal activity during repeated twitch contractions produced by a 0.5 msec supramaximal voltage stimulus delivered once every second. NOTE: Muscle spindle afferents should pause during the twitch contraction18,19 (Figure 2).\nUse data acquisition software to apply length changes at different speeds and to different lengths. Use a custom script to automate this task (see supplemental information for a screenshot of the script and directions on how to customize the stretches given). Apply ramp-and-hold stretches of 4 sec at stretch lengths of 2.5%, 5%, and 7.5% Lo and stretch speeds of 20, 40, or 60% Lo/sec 15. NOTE: See user manual for specific force and length controller for necessary voltage-to-millimeter conversion factor.\nAt the end of the experiment, determine muscle health at 24 °C using maximal isometric tetanic contractions (500 msec train, 120 Hz train frequency, 0.5 msec pulse width, supramaximal voltage). Compare the peak contractile force to previously reported values (~24 N/cm2 9,20)."
