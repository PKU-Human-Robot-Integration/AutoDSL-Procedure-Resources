    "NOTE: Ethics Statement: The Institutional Care and Use Committees (IACUC) of the Medical College of Wisconsin and the Clement J. Zablocki VA Medical Center approved all procedures.\n1. Animal Preparation and Monitoring\nAnesthetize the rat in an induction chamber, using 5% isoflurane in medical air. When the righting reflex is absent and squeezing the hind paw produces no withdrawal reflex, reduce anesthesia to 2% and transfer the animal to the scanner bed in a head-first prone position. Maintain 2% isoflurane through a nose cone device throughout the procedure, and keep medical air at a flow rate of approximately 1 L/min. Apply a small amount of lubricating ointment to the rat's eyes to avoid damage to the cornea while under anesthesia.\nPlace a respiratory monitoring belt securely around the rat’s torso. Connect the belt to a respiratory gating system. Before advancing the rat into the scanner bore, check the respiratory monitoring computer to ensure the respiratory cycle is clear and consistent. Adjust the belt if necessary, since this step is imperative for image quality.\nMonitor and maintain the animal’s body temperature at 37 °C through a rectal probe and warm air heating system. Maintain the respiratory rate between 30-45 breaths per min by adjusting the level of anesthesia between 1.2 and 2%.\nPosition the rat in the head holder with a bite bar and screw-in ear bars (Figure 1), and slide the head into a quadrature volume coil until the cervical spine is positioned in the center of the coil.\n\tNOTE: The rat’s shoulders may prevent further progression into the coil.\nAdvance the rat and supporting holders into the scanner bore. If applicable, adjust the tuning and matching capacitors of the coil to the proper frequency and impedance according to the instructions provided by the coil vendor.\n2. MRI Scanning Parameters",
    "NOTE: The procedures described here used a 9.4 T horizontal bore small animal system but are applicable to other field strengths of small animal MRI systems.\nUse the MRI system’s automated procedures for detection of the resonance frequency, iteratively improving the homogeneity of the magnetic field (shimming), calibration of the radiofrequency power, and adjustment of the receiver gain.\nUsing the system’s software interface, obtain a default three-plane scout scan to ensure correct positioning.\n\t\nClick “New scan”, select tripilot, and click the “traffic light” to acquire the images.\nEnsure the center of the cervical spine is aligned with both the center of the magnet and the center of the MRI coil. To center the spine within the magnet, push or pull on the cradle and reacquire the scout scan for verification.\nTo adjust the position of the cervical spine relative to the MRI coil, remove the cradle from the magnet for repositioning. If necessary, repeat this process until the position is consistent. If the animal is repositioned, repeat step 2.1.\nAdd a new echo-planar diffusion weighted spin-echo sequence (DtiEpi) to the current imaging protocol.\n\t\nConfigure and acquire diffusion weighted images with the DWI sequence using the default settings except for the following:\nOpen the slice position graphical interface to prescribe 12 slices with a thickness of 0.75 mm. Orient the slices perpendicular to the main axis of the cervical cord. Ensure consistent slice positioning between different animals or across different imaging sessions using the base of the cerebellum as an internal reference.\nSet the saturation bands to ‘on’. Position 4 saturation bands with a thickness of 10 mm outside of the spinal cord to minimize the signal from these tissues and reduce their potential to induce artifacts (Figure 3). Set respiratory gating (‘trigger module’) to ‘on’.",
    "NOTE: The custom respiratory gating requires knowledge and experience in pulse sequence programming. If this is not available, a workaround is to reduce the number of slices to 3-5 and the TR to 1 s to ensure that all slices are obtained in-between breaths of the animal. Repeat the full sequence with the other subset of slices to obtain the full coverage of the cervical cord.\nClick the toolbox icon and then click “Edit method.” Set the number of EPI segments to 4. Change the phase encoding direction to left-right. Other default settings should be: echo spacing = 0.3234 ms, total echo train length per EPI segment = 32.\n\t\tNOTE: The phase encoding set to the left-right direction rather than anterior-posterior will reduce the contamination of motion from other structures.\nUse the following geometrical settings. Matrix size = 128 x 128, and in-plane field-of-view = 25.6 x 25.6 mm, resulting in an in-plane spatial resolution = 0.200 x 0.200 mm. Ensure slice thickness = 0.75 mm. Slice order = ‘interleaved’, slice gap = 0 mm.\nUse the following diffusion weighting settings: DW measure mode = ‘DW contrast’, diffusion gradient duration (δ) = 7 ms, diffusion gradient separation (Δ) = 12 ms, number of b-values = 8, desired b-values = 0, 250, 500, 750, 1,000, 1,500, 2,500, 3,500 mm/s2, number of diffusion directions = 2, diffusion weighting directions = [1 0 0] and [0 0 1] (made to be in the planes parallel and orthogonal to the spinal cord axis).",
    "NOTE: With these settings, we achieved b-values as high as 3,500 s/mm2. Hardware specifications and other system performance characteristics may limit the b-value, since diffusion gradient duration (δ) and diffusion gradient separation (Δ) are dependent on the gradient performance, which on our system were: (maximum gradient strength: 440 mT/m, maximum slew rate: 3,440 T/m/s). For measurements of kurtosis, 2 b-values, with the higher b-value of at least 2,000 s/mm2, are recommended.\nUse the following timing settings. echo time (TE) = 27 ms (set to minimum by entering 0), repetition time (TR) = 1,800 msec.\nAcquire the prepared sequence. With the parameters listed above, the total acquisition time is approximately 25 min.\nThroughout all scans, monitor the respiratory gating software and adjust the delay period between the “trigger” (software detection of expiration) and the signal to the MRI system so that acquisitions occur only in the quiescent (unmoving) portion of the respiratory cycle (Figure 2a, stable portion of gray line). A trigger delay between 100-400 msec is necessary depending on the animal’s respiration pattern. This will help to reduce artifacts that occur with respiratory motion (Figure 3e).\nIf available, repeat the sequence with the custom “reverse blips” set to ‘on’, which requires an additional 25 minutes of acquisition time.\n\tNOTE: If the custom ‘reverse-blip’ sequence9 (required for susceptibility artifact correction during Step 3) is unavailable, only a single EPI phase encoding direction is possible, whereas the reversed blip sequence modification allows the choice of phase encoding direction (right-to-left or left-to-right).\nWhen imaging is completed, remove the animal from the holder and return it to its cage. Do not leave an animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\n3. Image Processing",
    "Export data from the system in DICOM format directly from the system (preferable) or convert the data to NIFTI format using custom or third-party software.\nPerform susceptibility artifact correction.\n\t\nExtract the b=0 volumes from each scan into a single file, using utilities provided with FSL or other MRI software packages. One file for each phase encode direction is required.\n\t\tNOTE: For example, if each scan consisted of 8 scans of varying b-values with diffusion weighting in the transverse direction, followed by 8 scans of diffusion weighting in the longitudinal direction, the image file contains b=0 scans in the 1st and 9th volumes, and can be extracted and assembled with the following shell code:\n\t\tfslroi ${up}_dwi_masked.nii.gz temp1 0 1\n\t\tfslroi ${up}_dwi_masked.nii.gz temp2 8 1\n\t\tfslroi ${down}_dwi_masked.nii.gz temp3 0 1\n\t\tfslroi ${down}_dwi_masked.nii.gz temp4 8 1\n\t\tfslmerge -t blip_both temp1 temp2 temp3 temp4\n\t\t(where in this case $up and $down are the scans with normal and reversed phase encode directions, respectively).\nUse the ‘topup’ command in fsl10,11 to create a corrected file with reduced image distortion artifacts. Apply this correction to the raw DWI images to be used for creation of parameter maps.\n\t\tNOTE: Instructions for use of the command can be found at http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/TOPUP/TopupUsersGuide[href=http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/TOPUP/TopupUsersGuide]. Example code to use the command in this case is as follows:\n\t\ttopup --imain=blip_both_nlmf_b0images_masked.nii --datain=../topup_data.txt --config=./b02b0_ratspine.cnf --out=topup_splines_nlmf --iout=$out --verbose --logout=topuplog.log\n\t\tdwiup=`ls ${up}*dwi_nlmFilt.nii`\n\t\tdwidown=`ls ${down}*dwi_nlmFilt.nii`\n\t\tapplytopup --imain=${dwiup},${dwidown} --datain=../topup_data.txt --method=jac --inindex=1,$ind --topup=topup_splines_nlmf --out=DWI_${out} –v\n\t\tCopy and edit the default file in ${FSLDIR}/etc/flirtsch/b02b0.cnf for the rat spinal cord by reducing each of the values in the --warpres and --fwhm lines by a factor of 10.",
    "If images with diffusion weighting are acquired along at least 6 non orthogonal directions (using a DTI scheme in Paravision or a similar custom design), use software packages such as fsl’s Diffusion Toolbox12 or Camino13 to calculate standard DTI parameter maps. If not, use a custom procedure for generating useful metrics, which employs diffusion weighting only along 2 directions, for example, as indicated in steps 3.4 onward.\nLoad the corrected DWI file outputted by TOPUP into fslview and select “File -> Create Mask” from the menu. Use the pencil tools to draw a region of interest within one tissue type (for example GM, dorsal WM, or ventrolateral WM). Save this file and repeat for any other desired ROIs to use later.\n\tNOTE: Other procedures to segment ROIs from the spinal cord have been documented14,15 and may be preferable for advanced users.\nUse the ROI file to mask the DWI file and then calculate the mean signal within the ROI for each image volume using the following command:\n\tfslstats -t DWI_corrected.nii.gz -k GM_mask.nii.gz –M\nCopy the first 8 results into numerical computing program such as MATLAB, as a vector for transverse signal (for example call it sig_T), and the second 8 results as a vector for longitudinal signal (sig_L), where 8 is the number of b-values used.\n\t\nCopy the b-values in a numerical computing program as a vector of 8 b-values. The b-values for the transverse and longitudinal directions were identical. If possible, the effective b-value, rather than the nominal b-value, should be obtained from the scanner, which is listed in the parameter window from step 2.3.5 as “Effective B value”.",
    "Use the numerical computing program’s curve fitting toolbox to fit the signal vs. b-value data to the desired model by typing cftools at the command prompt. To do this, click “Data…” and select the signal vectors as y-data and the b-values as x-data. Click “Fitting…” and under “Type of fit” choose “Custom Equation,” then click “New” and “General Equations” to enter an equation for fitting.\nTo fit to the standard diffusion model, enter the equation:\n\tS0.*exp(-x.*D)”   (1)\nTo fit to a model which includes diffusion and a second order term (kurtosis; K) to measure the deviation from gaussian diffusion16, enter the equation:\n\tS0.*exp(-x.*D+(1/6).*(x.*D).^2.*K)”   (2)\nClick “OK” and “Apply”. Observe the estimated values for diffusivity (D) and kurtosis (K) on the output window. In the “Data Set:” selector, select the sig_T (or sig_L) data for use with equation (1) or (2) and click “Apply”.\nCalculate the anisotropy index (AI) using the transverse and longitudinal diffusivities:\n\tAI=(DL-DT)/(DL+DT)   (3)\n\tThis is analogous to the fractional anisotropy (FA) calculated from the DTI model. An anisotropy index for kurtosis can also be calculated using transverse and longitudinal kurtosis in place of diffusivity.\n\tNOTE This method gives values of model parameters such as KT, DT, etc. It is also possible to use the command-line operation of the curve fitting toolbox on each voxel within the spine to create a map of each parameter from the model. Alternative fitting methods may be used and are detailed elsewhere.17"
