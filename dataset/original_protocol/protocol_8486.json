    "All experiments were conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the International Association for the Study of Pain and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Chungnam National University (Daejeon, South Korea).\n1. Induction of CCI on Sciatic Nerve\nHouse male ICR mice weighing 20 - 25 g under a 12 h light/dark cycle at controlled room temperature (maintained at 20 - 25 °C) and humidity (40 - 60%), with free access to food and water. Allow an acclimation period for mice in the animal care room of at least 1 week before surgery.\nDuring housing, observe the appearance and behavior of the mice and do not use mice showing abnormal locomotor activity.\n\t\tNOTE: One day prior to the CCI surgery, measure the mechanical sensitivity of the hind paw by applying von Frey filaments and perform the automated gait analysis to obtain normal baseline values. Then, assign mice randomly to control and experimental groups.\nOn the day of surgery, anesthetize mice by injecting 2,2,2-tribromoethanol (250 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (IP)).\n\tNOTE: Wear personal protective equipment such as surgical gown, gloves, and mask.\n\t\nWeigh 2.5 g of 2,2,2-tribromoethanol and add 2-methyl-2-buthanol to the final volume of 5 mL. Keep the solution away from light (e.g., use a dark container or wrap in foil).\nAllow reagents to dissolve completely by heating at 40 °C and stirring for 10-30 min.\nAdd distilled water to the final volume of 200 mL and stir until mixed well.\nStore aliquots at 4 °C and keep in the dark. After two weeks, the anesthetic should be replaced with new aliquots.",
    "Inject a volume of 20 µL per 1 g body weight. For example, if the body weight of the mouse is 25 g, give 500 µL of solution. The typical duration of this anesthesia is 1 h.\n\t\tNOTE: This solution will become toxic when exposed to light and/or heat so be careful to avoid exposure to light and heat. An IP injection route is highly recommended.\nWhen the mouse falls into deep anesthesia, place it on the operating table with the dorsal side up (i.e., prone position) and sterilize the outer mid-thigh area of the right side with a 70% alcohol swab.\n\tNOTE: Confirm deep anesthesia by checking the lack of response to pinch or pressure stimulus on the hind paws or tail.\nInduce the CCI on the right sciatic nerve of the mouse.\nMake an incision on the skin around the mid-thigh area of 1.0 - 1.5 cm length with a scalpel blade.\nBluntly dissect the thigh muscles with the micro-mosquito hemostat to expose the sciatic nerve.\nLigate the exposed sciatic nerve 3 times with 1.0 - 1.5 mm intervals using a 4-0 chromic catgut suture.\n\t\tNOTE: Make loose ligations by tying off the sciatic nerve until mild shaking appears on the ipsilateral hind paw. The sham group of mice received the same surgical opening under similar conditions except without nerve ligation.\nClose the surgical opening with 3 - 4 simple interrupted sutures using 5-0 silk and sterilize with povidone iodine for disinfection of the outer area of surgery.\nAfter surgery, place the mouse in a clean cage on a heating pad. When animals are recovered from anesthesia, return them to their home cage.",
    "NOTE: In this study, antibiotics were not used. The CCI+GBP group received IP gabapentin (GBP) at a dose of 50 mg/kg once daily as a positive control.\n2. Measurement of Mechanical Allodynia (von Frey Test)\nNOTE: Assess the frequency of the withdrawal response to the mechanical stimuli by using 1 g of von Frey filament to the plantar surface of the ipsilateral hind paw.\nOn each test day, bring mice to the behavioral test room and acclimate the mice in their own home cage for at least 30 min before the test.\n\tNOTE: Wear personal protective equipment such as surgical gown, gloves, and mask.\nPut the mouse in a transparent acrylic box on the metal mesh floor and acclimate the mouse for 30 min.\nGently apply 1 g of von Frey filament to the plantar surface of the hind paw until the filament bends.\nApply filament stimulation to the ipsilateral hind paw 10 times with at least 10 s intervals and record the result.\n\tNOTE: In this study, the number of paw withdrawal responses from 10 trials are shown as percentage of paw withdrawal frequency (PWF, %). The von Frey test was performed every two days after CCI surgery.\n3. Performing Automated Gait Analysis",
    "NOTE: The gait analysis system visualizes each paw print while the animal is walking and analyzes automatically various gait parameters, such as paw print, paw intensity, stride length, stance phase, step sequence, swing, swing speed, etc. In this study, we showed paw print area and single stance after converting the data into the percentage change between contralateral left versus ipsilateral right hind paw. Thus, a result of 50% indicates that the size of the paw print and the duration of paw area in contact with floor, between the left and right sides are same. In addition, lower data values approaching 0% indicate that both the size and duration of contact are decreased in the ipsilateral hind paw as compared to the contralateral side (see panel B of Figure 2 and Figure 3).\nFor acclimation, keep the mice within the gait analysis device for 10 min once a day beginning 5 days before the CCI surgery.\n\tNOTE: Gait analysis test including acclimation should be performed in the dark.\nBring the mice to the test room for gait analysis and acclimate in their home cage for at least 30 min before the test.\nIn the setup tab of the program menu, set the \"walkway length\" to 30 cm, and set the \"maximum run duration\" to 5 s and the \"maximum run variation\" to 50%.\nSelect a registered camera from the 'setup' tab of the 'program' menu.\nSelect \"open acquisition\" from the 'acquire' tab of the 'program' menu.\nFollowing the status message, click the 'snap background' button to take a background picture of the empty (i.e., blank) walkway.\nClick the 'Start acquisition' button and place a mouse on the walkway; the recording starts automatically according to the movement of the mouse.",
    "NOTE: When the mouse clearly walks across the walkway, the program automatically classifies this move as \"Compliant run\" with a green icon. If the software failed to detect the foot print, the experimenter will see a red icon and must repeat the recording. At least five successful compliant runs are needed for analysis.\nAfter the test, select 'classify runs' from the acquire tab of the 'program' menu.\nSelect the runs for analysis and click the 'auto classify' button.\n\tNOTE: After classification, all statistic parameters are automatically saved and the experimenter can find the results by clicking \"view run statistics\" on the analyze menu.\nSubscription Required.
