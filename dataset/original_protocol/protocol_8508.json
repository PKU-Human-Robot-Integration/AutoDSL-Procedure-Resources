    "NOTE: All animal experiments are approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas as directed by the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8th Edition, National Research Council).\n1. Tissue Collection, Region Identification, and Sectioning\nSubject adult, male, Sprague-Dawley Rats, approximately six weeks old and 250 - 300 g, to experimental fluid percussion injury, as described in Shimamura et al.4.\nTwenty-four hours after experimental TBI, humanely euthanize the animals by placing them in a chamber with an isoflurane concentration of 4% until deeply anesthetized. Ensure death by decapitation, excise the brains, and immediately freeze in powdered dry-ice. Store frozen brains in a -80 °C freezer until sectioning.\nPrior to any LCM procedure that includes transcriptional analysis, clean all surfaces with RNase eliminating detergent to mitigate the risk for contamination and RNA degradation.\n\tNOTE: This cleaning includes the area used for staining, the cryostat where tissue is sectioned, and the area around the LCM device.\nRetrieve the brain tissue from storage and place into a cryostat cooled to -20 °C. Allow the brain to equilibrate to the temperature of the cryostat chamber for ~10 min.\nPlace the brain ventral side up on a gauze sheet on top of the cryostat stage. With a clean, RNase-free razor blade, cut off the posterior portion just rostral to the cerebellum (can be saved or discarded) and the portion just anterior to the optic chiasm (och).\nPlace a small amount of optimal cutting temperature (OCT) medium into two separate cryomolds. Place the brain (containing the frontal association cortex (FrA) and nucleus accumbens core (AcbC)) into the cryomolds anterior side down. Add sufficient OCT medium to cover the tissue.",
    "Repeat this step with the brain tissue containing the hippocampus (Hp) and suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).\nAllow the OCT medium to freeze completely for ~20 min in the cryostat.\nOnce the tissue and OCT medium are completely frozen, squeeze a small amount of OCT onto a mounting head and press the frozen cryomolds containing the tissue onto the mounting head. Allow the OCT to freeze completely so that the mold containing the tissue is securely attached to the head.\nSecure the head attachment to the sectioning mount and tighten the screw. Adjust the cutting angle in relation to the cryostat blade with the adjustment levers to ensure sections are cut evenly.\nSet the section thickness to 30 µm. When sectioning the tissue block containing the FrA and AcbC, first begin sectioning until cerebral cortex is apparent and then start collecting.\nReferring to the Rat Brain Atlas12, section and collect brain sections by gently placing room-temperature polyethylene napthalate (PEN) membrane slides on top of the sectioned tissue for the FrA until the secondary motor cortex (M2) is reached at Bregma 5.16 mm.\n\t\nVisually ensure adherence to slide by inspecting if tissue and OCT are completely melted onto slide. Store all slides with tissue sections in the cryostat until staining.\nContinue sectioning until the anterior commissure (aca) becomes visible and unites into one complete commissure underneath the now apparent lateral ventricles (LV) at Bregma 1.80 mm.\nCollect sections until the LVs appear to connect with the aca at Bregma 0.84 mm.\nOnce sectioning for the FrA and AcbC has been completed, remove the mounted tissue block, and replace with the block containing HP and SCN.\nSection until the och is flattened at Bregma -0.48 mm, when the third ventricle (3V) becomes apparent.",
    "Collect sections for the SCN from this point until Bregma -0.72 mm, when the supraoptic decussation (sox) begins.\n\tNOTE: It may be necessary to collect more tissue sections throughout the och as the SCN is easily passed over.\nFor HP collection, section until the horns of granule cell layer dentate gyrus (GrDG) are visibly apparent at Bregma -3.00 mm.\nCollect sections until the hippocampal CA subfields are fused in the coronal sections at Bregma -4.78 mm. This detail allows for complete collection of the hippocampus under the craniotomy and injury site.\n\tNOTE: As demonstrated in previous publications from this lab, most injured cells will be apparent within this range and it is appropriate for gene or microRNA expression analysis.\n2. Staining Protocol\nPrior to staining, wash all dishware and the staining area in a chemical fume hood with RNase-eliminating detergent. This preparation mitigates the risk of RNA degradation due to contamination.\nPrepare all staining reagents and solutions in nuclease free water.\nTake a rack of slides stored in the cryostat and place in the fume hood. Allow slides to warm for 30 s. Place them into staining solutions (prepared with nuclease free water) as follows: 75% EtOH for 1 min, nuclease free water for 1 min, 1% cresyl violet for 1 min, nuclease free water for 30 s, nuclease free water for 30 s, 95% EtOH for 30 s, 100% EtOH for 30 s, xylene for 3 min, and xylene for 3 min.\nAllow the rack to air-dry for no more than 10 min at room temperature in the fume hood. Alternatively, place racks into an Rnase-free vacuum desiccator for quicker drying. Once dried, proceed immediately to LCM.\n3. Stereotactic Atlas Guided Laser Capture Microdissection with the LCM System",
    "Prior to beginning any LCM procedure for RNA analysis, wipe down the collection area and the area around the device with RNase-eliminating detergent and 100% EtOH.\nFlip the power switch on the IR laser generating unit before turning on microscope base, and allow the system to initialize before software is started from the desktop.\n\tNOTE: If not completed in this order, the software will not recognize the microscope.\nOnce the software has booted and run through its initializing steps, press the \"Present Stage\" button in the software \"Setup Panel.\" The modular stage will move into position where LCM Macro Caps and slides can be loaded and off-loaded.\nPlace the PEN membrane slides into the holders (up to three at a time) with the frosted edge facing rightward.\n\tNOTE: If placed in the holder in the wrong orientation, the software may not be able to properly recognize the desired IR or UV cutting area.\nClick the \"Mem\" checkbox in the \"Cap and Slide Handling Area\" next to the respective slide (i.e., A, B, or C). This step denotes if the slide is a membrane glass slide. Then click on the desired slide to be captured first.\nTo make the camera take a tiled image for tissue location and orientation for cap placements, select \"Image\" on the Toolbar and select \"Acquire Overview.\"\n\tNOTE: If the user is familiar with the tissue being collected, this step can be omitted by using the manual scroll ball to position the \"Region Center\" for collection.\nPlace the cursor over the area on the tiled image (or relative location without tiled image), right click and select \"Place Cap at Region Center.\" The software will automatically place a cap over the selected position.\nSelect a location.",
    "NOTE: To ensure that the IR laser is properly aligned and will pick up only areas where spots are laid by the software it must be located before proceeding.\n\t\nMove to an area within the cap where no tissue is present. Click \"i\" in the \"Microdissect Tools Pane\" and select the \"IR Locate\" tab. From the Pane, fire an IR test shot to assess where the IR laser is firing and the size of the spot.\nWith the cursor, right click in the middle of IR spot and select \"Located IR Spot.\"\n\t\tNOTE: Size and intensity of the IR beam can be changed by manually altering the \"Power, Diameter, or Duration\" under each spot size designator or by moving the sliding scale at the bottom of the dialog box. Several test shots may need to be fired to ensure proper spot size. The IR laser must be re-located each time the position of the cap changes or slides are switched.\nFor UV cutting, locate the UV laser by selecting the \"UV Locate\" tab in the dialog box.\n\t\tNOTE: Because the UV laser and the IR laser move in unison, there is no need to continually re-locate the UV laser each time the position is changed.\nChoose the \"Freehand Drawing\" option in the \"Select Tools Pane\". Using a touchscreen stylus, draw around the perimeter of the region of interest while making sure not to lose contact between the touchscreen and the stylus head. Make sure to connect the beginning and end-points together.\n\tNOTE: IR spots will be laid down automatically through the software but the user may choose to lay down additional spots to ensure the tissue is adhered to the cap after UV cutting has been performed.",
    "For FrA collection, perform a gross laser capture of cortical tissue up to when the M2 cortex appears at Bregma 5.16 mm.\n\tNOTE: This detail can be amended such that only specific portions of the FrA or specific cell types are collected.\nFor AcbC collection, laser capture an area close in proximity to the aca.\n\tThe core and shell of the AcbC perform different functions and are physiologically unique. Thus it is important to follow the brain atlas as close as possible. It is recommended to collect from no further past bregma 0.84 mm, as the two subregions become too closely associated with each other.\nFor Hp collection, laser capture the CA 1, 2, and 3 hippocampal subfields starting at Bregma 3.00 mm and using the completely formed GrDG as a physical landmark for morphological identification.\n\tNOTE: For the purposes of this study, do not collect past Bregma -4.78 mm, which can be visually demarcated as the point when the Hp subfields are fused and point ventrally. This area was chosen as most injured neurons can be discovered directly under the injury site6.\nFor SCN collection, first visually identify the densely packed nuclei that sit dorsal to the och and then collect.\nAfter collection of regions (listed above), move LCM Macro Caps to the \"QC position\" and inspect for complete tissue adherence by visually ensuring UV cut tissue is attached to the membrane. Quickly place the cap ontoan RNase-free 0.5 mL thin walled reaction tube containing 100 µL of cell lysis buffer.\nVortex samples briefly to ensure complete lysis and store at -80 °C. At this point, LCM can be paused and samples stored until used for downstream genomic analysis6."
