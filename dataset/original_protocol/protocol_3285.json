    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nNote: A similar protocol was used in different studies.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4],5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nStep one: prepare the Drosophila brain sample\nTiming: 5–10 min\nThe purpose of this step is to prepare the brain such that the mushroom bodies are accessible for image acquisition and dye electroporation.\nPrepare two dishes, one in which to dissect the brain and another to hold the sample.\nProcure a small, 10 mm petri dish and line both the lid and the base with a thin piece of SYLGARD®, a material that will prevent the brain from adhering to the dish.\nUse the base of the petri dish as a container in which to dissect and the lid as a receptacle for the fully prepped sample.\nFill both halves of the petri dish with saline solution.\nDissect the brain.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\nAnesthetize the fly; CO2 is suitable for this protocol.\nUse forceps to remove the head from the body, separate the cuticle from the brain, and remove as much trachea from the brain as possible.\nRemove the thin, outermost layer of the brain to permit an electrode to pierce through the brain.\nUse a glass Pasteur pipette to transfer the brain from the bottom half of the petri dish to an aliquot of 2 mg/mL collagenase solution. Make sure to pre-wet the pipette to prevent the brain from sticking to the wall during transfer.\nIncubate the brain in the collagenase solution for approximately 30 s.\nTransfer the collagenase-treated brain directly to the lid of the petri dish.\nPrepare the sample for two-photon microscopy.\nOrient the brain with the anterior side facing the piece of SYLGARD® and the posterior side facing upwards; this orientation will provide easy access to the calyx of the mushroom body and the somata of the Kenyon cells (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3054-Fig1.jpg",
    "Figure 1. Pinning the brain\n(A) Schematic of the brain pinned with the posterior side facing upwards (and the anterior side facing the piece of SYLGARD®), the orientation where the mushroom body calyces are visible (colored red). This is the orientation used in step 2: photo-label a Kenyon cell and step 3: dye-fill projection neurons.\n(B) Schematic of the brain pinned with the anterior side facing upwards (and the posterior side facing the piece of SYLGARD®), the orientation where the antennal lobes are visible (colored red). This is the orientation used in step 4: score the dye-filled glomeruli.\nCreate pins by cutting tungsten wire into small segments.\nSecure the brain by pinning through both optic lobes, into the SYLGARD®. Before proceeding to the steps that require two-photon microscopy, make sure that the pins are anchored and that both hemispheres of the brain are level.\nStep two: Photo-label a Kenyon cell\nTiming: 20–25 min\nThe purpose of this step is to photo-label a Kenyon cell to visualize its claw-shaped dendritic terminals.\nPrepare for two-photon microscopy.\nSituate the petri dish containing the brain sample under the objective lens with the dorsal side of the brain facing the micromanipulator.\nSwitch to the 60× objective (if the sample was located using a lower objective) before using two-photon microscopy to visualize the brain.\nNote: We used an Ultima two-photon microscope (Bruker) equipped with an ultrafast Chameleon Ti: Sapphire laser (Coherent) modulated by a Pockels Cell (Conotopics) for both photo-labeling and image acquisition. The exact instrumental configuration described here may be different from instruments made by other manufacturers. For the imaging software, we used Prairie View 5.4 (Bruker).",
    "Note: The orientation of the brain for two-photon microscopy during steps 2 and 3 is dictated by the handedness of the micromanipulator system that is being used. We use a setup in which the micromanipulator is located to the left of the microscope, and, therefore, we situate the petri dish such that the dorsal side of the brain is facing left. Aligning the dorsal side of the brain with the micromanipulator is important, as this orientation will permit the dye-filled electrode used in step 3 to access the mushroom body calyces.\nSelect a Kenyon cell to photo-label.\nConfigure the imaging software according to the live scan parameters that are listed in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section.\nTune the laser to 925 nm and use the live scan mode to visualize the sample.\nLocate the mushroom body calyx and the Kenyon cells; the somata of Kenyon cells are proximal to the calyx and have a spherical shape (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3054-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Photo-labeling a Kenyon cell\n(A) Locate the mushroom body calyx (outlined in red) and select a Kenyon cell soma (yellow arrow) to photo-label (digital zoom: 2).\n(B) Zoom in on the Kenyon cell soma, draw a small ROI (cyan box) within the boundaries of the soma, and photo-label the ROI as described in step 2: photo-label a Kenyon cell, sub-step 7 (digital zoom: 32).\n(C) The soma of the targeted Kenyon cell (yellow arrow) is brighter after photo-conversion (digital zoom: 2).\n(D) The dendritic arbors and claw-shaped terminals of the photo-labeled Kenyon cell are visible 10 min after photo-conversion (digital zoom: 2).\n(E) An enlarged view of one of the claws (yellow arrow) formed by the photo-labeled Kenyon cell (digital zoom: 8).",
    "(F) The axons of the photo-labeled Kenyon cell (yellow arrow) project in the gamma lobe of the mushroom body (imaged during step 4: score the dye-filled glomeruli) (digital zoom: 1.5). All images are composites, and all scale bars are 10 μm.\nChoose the Kenyon cell soma to be photo-labeled; zoom in to the point where it occupies most of the frame (suggested digital zoom factor: 32×) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nStop the live scan mode.\nPhoto-convert the PA-GFP expressed by the selected Kenyon cell.\nDraw a region of interest (ROI) within the boundaries of the soma (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nConfigure the imaging software according to the photo-labeling parameters listed in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section.\nTune the laser to 710 nm. Use the single image mode and collect 3 to 5 scans to induce the photo-conversion of PA-GFP.\nTune the laser back to 925 nm, exit the ROI, and reset the digital zoom.\nIn live scan mode, verify that only one Kenyon cell soma was photo-labeled during the process (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C) (See problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3] in the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section).\nWait for 10 min.\nIn live scan mode, view the calyx to confirm that the Kenyon cell was successfully photo-labeled. At this point, the entire morphology of the Kenyon cell should be noticeably brighter than the rest of the brain (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nImage the photo-labeled Kenyon cell.\nSet up a Z-series that encompasses the entire volume of the calyx (suggested digital zoom: 2×).\nDocument the number of claw-shaped dendritic terminals of the photo-labeled Kenyon cell.\nNote: We used 1 μm steps for all Z-series taken during this protocol.\nNote: This image sequence of the calyx and photo-labeled Kenyon cell can serve as a guide for locating the claws during step 3.",
    "Optional: This procedure can also be performed on one Kenyon cell of the opposite hemisphere. This measure will increase the probability of successfully photo-labeling a Kenyon cell or, possibly, two (one per hemisphere).\nStep three: Dye-fill the projection neurons\nTiming: 20–25 min\nThe purpose of this step is to use dye electroporation to dye-fill the projection neurons connected to the claw-shaped dendritic terminals — or 'claws' — of the photo-labeled Kenyon cell.\nPrepare for dye electroporation.\nKeep the brain in the same orientation as step 2 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nSubmerge the non-pulled end of one of the electrodes that was pulled in preparation step 3 in the aliquot of Texas Red™ dextran dye that was made in preparation step 2, sub-step 6. Allow the internal capillary to fill.\nUse a syringe, equipped with an inorganic membrane filter (GE Life Sciences Whatman™) and a MicroFil™ (World Precision Instruments) tip, to flush the electrode with saline and eliminate any bubbles that might obstruct its tip.\nSecure the electrode within its dedicated holder (Warner Instruments), which is located on the head stage of the micromanipulator (Sutter Instrument).\nAlign the electrode with the brain.\nSubsequently, align the electrode with the calyx.\nNote: We use the MPC-365 Multi Motorized Narrow-Format Micromanipulator Control System (Sutter Instrument) to move the dye-filled electrode. This system is comprised of the MPC-200 controller, ROE-200, MP-265 narrow format stepper motor manipulator, and 4″ dovetail extension. To customize the MP-265 manipulator so it accommodates the electrodes we use for dye electroporation, we attach an MP-ROD rod holder (Sutter Instrument) to the manipulator and fit an MP-515A electrode holder (Warner Instruments) within the MP-ROD holder. We use an X28510 mounting adapter plate (Sutter Instrument) to affix the micromanipulator to an MT-75 stand (Sutter Instrument), which we place to the left of our microscope.",
    "Note: The movement of the manipulator is controlled via rotating knobs on a rotary optical encoder input device (ROE). Each ROE has modes that dictate the speed and fineness of the movement of the manipulator. We routinely use mode 0 (accelerated mode) on the ROE-200 (Sutter Instrument) to initially align the electrode with the brain and mode 1 to align it with the mushroom body calyx (under bright field microscopy). We use mode 4 (increased sensitivity and decreased speed) to control the electrode during the dye electroporation procedure (under two-photon microscopy).\nDye-fill the claws of the photo-labeled Kenyon cell.\nConfigure the electrophysiology rig parameters for dye electroporation as specified in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section.\nConfigure the imaging software according to the live scan parameters that are listed in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section.\nVerify that the laser is tuned to 925 nm.\nUsing the live scan mode, locate, and select, the first claw of the photo-labeled Kenyon cell to fill with dye (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3054-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Dye-filling projection neurons\n(A) Align the dye-filled electrode with the mushroom body calyx (digital zoom: 2). (A′) Select a first claw to fill (yellow arrow) (digital zoom: 8).\n(B) Insert the electrode into the calyx, targeting the claw of interest. Note that the invagination that is created when the electrode is pushed into the calyx will not impact the tissue and the dye-labeling in any meaningful way (digital zoom: 2).\n(C) Verify that the electrode is located within the claw before electroporating dye into it (digital zoom: 8).\n(D) The presynaptic bouton (yellow arrow) of the dye-filled projection neuron is visible after dye electroporation and once the electrode is removed (digital zoom: 8).",
    "(E) Verify that only one projection neuron was dye-filled after the first electroporation. Only one axon should be visible (yellow arrow). Note that once the dye diffuses throughout the projection neuron, not only will the bouton that was initially filled (white box) be labeled, but the other boutons (in this case only 1 bouton) of that projection neuron will be visible as well (digital zoom: 2).\n(F) Fill as many claws as possible; in this case, five claws were filled leading to the dye-labeling of five projection neurons (digital zoom: 2). All images are composites, and all scale bars are 10 μm.\nCarefully situate the tip of the electrode into the center of the claw. To prevent off-target labeling, make sure that the tip of the electrode is located within the claw in all planes in which the claw is visible (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 3C).\nManually administer one or two 10–50 V pulses to electroporate the dye into the presynaptic bouton formed by the projection neuron connected to the claw; the dye should quickly diffuse from the bouton to the main axon cable of the projection neuron (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D and 3E).\nVerify that only one projection neuron was filled with dye before proceeding to the next claw (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E) (See problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7] in the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section).\nRepeat sub steps 12d-g to fill as many of the claws as possible (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F).\nNote: We used the S88 Dual Output Square Pulse Stimulator (GRASS®) for dye electroporation.\nSet up a Z-series and image the entire volume of the calyx, documenting the Kenyon cell and its dye-filled presynaptic partners (suggested digital zoom: 2×).",
    "Note: In most cases, it is easier to begin with the claw that is the most proximal to the surface of the calyx and is the most dorsally located. Larger claws are also easier to fill. It must also be noted that the claws that are located deep into the calyx, immediately above the projection neuron tracts, are the most difficult to fill, as off-target labeling is more likely (see problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7] in the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section).\nNote: While the suggested range of amplitudes for the pulses is 10–50 V, successful results have consistently been achieved with 30 V.\nNote: During the process of dye-filling projection neurons, Kenyon cells can also be labeled. While such labeling is not aesthetically pleasing, it will not affect the data.\nStep four: Score the dye-filled glomeruli\nTiming: 10–15 min\nThe purpose of this step is to identify the olfactory glomeruli from which the dye-filled projection neurons originate.\nReverse the orientation of the brain to permit the visualization of the antennal lobes and mushroom body lobes.\nReturn to the dissection scope that was used in step 1.\nCarefully remove the pins from the optic lobes.\nFlip the brain so the posterior side is facing the SYLGARD® and the anterior side is facing the objective lens (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nRe-pin the brain and return to the two-photon microscope.\nImage the antennal lobe.\nConfigure the imaging software according to the live scan parameters for imaging the brain post-dye labeling that are listed in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section.\nVerify that the laser is tuned to 925 nm.\nCapture a Z-series that encompasses the entire antennal lobe and the somata of the projection neurons, which are located in three clusters surrounding the antennal lobe (the anterior-dorsal, lateral and ventral clusters).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3054-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Scoring dye-filled glomeruli",

All images are composites, and all scale bars are 10 μm.\n(E) An example of a connectivity matrix comprised of the sampled input of 200 different Kenyon cell samples. Each row corresponds to a Kenyon cell, and each column corresponds to a glomerulus. Each red dash represents a connection between a Kenyon cell and a given glomerulus, while a yellow dash indicates that a Kenyon cell receives 2 inputs from the same glomerulus.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3054-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Examples of successful and unsuccessful outcomes\n(A) The successful outcome of step 2: photo-label a Kenyon cell, in which only one Kenyon cell is labeled (yellow arrow) (digital zoom: 2).\n(B) An unsuccessful outcome of step 2, wherein two Kenyon cells are photo-labeled (yellow arrows) (digital zoom: 2).\n(C) A successful outcome of step 3: dye-fill projection neurons, in which only one projection neuron per claw is filled with dye (yellow arrow) (digital zoom: 8).\n(D) An unsuccessful outcome of step 3, wherein two projection neurons are filled upon dye electroporation into a single claw (yellow arrows) (digital zoom: 8).\n(E) An antennal lobe with robustly dye-filled glomeruli that are easy to identify (yellow arrows) (digital zoom: 2).\n(F) An antennal lobe with lightly labeled glomeruli that are difficult to score (yellow arrows) (digital zoom: 2). All images are composites, and all scale bars are 10 μm.",
    "Note: Two image sequences can be acquired: one that includes the somata, and one that is at a larger digital zoom to make it easier to identify the dye-filled glomeruli (suggested digital zooms: 1.5× and 2× respectively) (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A–4D and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]E).\nScore the dye-filled glomeruli.\nUse one of the publicly available maps of the antennal lobe as a guide for identifying which glomeruli were filled.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4],7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7],8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8],9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9],10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]\nTake note of the position of the projection neuron somata, as they can aid in the identification process.\nImage the mushroom body lobes (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nAcquire a Z-series that includes the αβ, α’β’, and γ mushroom body lobes (suggested digital zoom: 1.5×).\nNote: The mushroom body lobes are imaged at this point of the protocol, as opposed to directly after the Kenyon cell is photo-labeled in step 1, because the lobes are more visible from the anterior side of the brain.\nDetermine the identity of the photo-labeled Kenyon cell.\nLocate the axons of the photo-labeled Kenyon cell, which should be brighter than the rest of the mushroom body.\nUse one of the publicly available maps as a guide to determine which type of lobe its axons project to.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10],11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]\nReport the data in a connectivity matrix (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nCreate a table with one column for each type of glomerulus/projection neuron (there are 51 types) and one row for each Kenyon cell. In our previous studies, we analyzed between 200 and 250 Kenyon cells per genotype.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4],5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nAdditional information for each Kenyon cell sample should be included in the spreadsheet for future analyses. For example:\nthe type of Kenyon cell;\nthe total number of claws a Kenyon cell forms;\nthe number of claws that were successfully filled in step 3.",
    "Pause point: It is not necessary to score the dye-filled glomeruli and photo-labeled Kenyon cell during or directly after image acquisition. Step 4 sub-steps 16, 18, and 19 can be conducted at a later point or once all samples for a given connectivity matrix are collected.\nRe-score the connectivity matrix.\nOnce all samples are collected for a given matrix, it is important to re-score the entire matrix. This step will ensure that the experimenter is confident in the combination of glomeruli that each Kenyon cell sample receives input from; it will also ensure that the experimenter is consistent in their identification of each glomerulus type.\nFirst, re-score each sample (i.e., each row of the matrix) 5 times to reach a consensus.\nNext, re-score the matrix 5 times by glomerulus type (i.e., each column of the matrix), comparing all glomeruli of the same type to ensure that identification is consistent across samples."
