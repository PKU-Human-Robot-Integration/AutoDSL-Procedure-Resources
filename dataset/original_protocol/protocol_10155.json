    "1. Microfluidic Device Fabrication\nPrepare the microfluidic mask designs using computer-aided design (CAD) software (provided as .DWG; see Supplementary Files). Have these designs printed by the vendor with a 10 µm resolution on a circuit board film.\n\tNOTE: For multi-layered microfluidic devices, the corresponding masks contain alignment marks.\nFor each device, fabricate the SU-8 master mold (Figure 1A) as follows.\nPrepare a 3-in diameter silicon wafer by pouring approximately 1 mL of SU-8 3025 photoresist onto the center of the wafer. Secure the wafer on the spin coater chuck by applying suction.\nSee Table 1 for a listing of the layer thicknesses and spin speeds for each device. For all devices, begin the spin coating with 30 s at 500 rpm, followed by 30 s at the indicated speed.\nRemove the SU-8-silicon wafer from the spin coater and soft bake it on a hotplate set to 135 °C for 30 min. Allow the wafer to cool to room temperature after baking.\nExpose the SU-8-silicon wafer with the appropriate microfluidic mask under a collimated 190-mW, 365-nm UV LED for 3 min.\nAfter the exposure, hard bake the wafer on a hotplate set to 135 °C for 1 min. Following this baking step, allow the wafer to cool to room temperature.\nFor a single-layered microfluidic device, skip to step 1.2.7. For a multi-layered microfluidic device, repeat steps 1.2.1 - 1.2.5 for the second layer of the photoresist (Figure 1B).\nFollowing the first hard bake for a single layer device (or the second hard bake for a multi-layered device), develop the wafer by immersing it into a bath of propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PGMEA) for 30 min.",
    "After the wafer's development, use a squirt bottle containing PGMEA to rinse the wafer. Then rinse the wafer with a squirt bottle containing isopropanol before placing it on a 135 °C hotplate for 1 min to dry.\nPlace the wafer (henceforth referred to as the master) into a Petri dish for casting with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS).\nWith the master prepared in step 1.2, proceed to perform the device fabrication with a PDMS casting.\nPrepare the PDMS by combining a silicone base with a curing agent in an 11:1 ratio by mass. Mix the silicone base and curing agent by hand with a stir stick.\nDegas the PDMS by placing it into a degassing chamber and applying a vacuum. Allow the PDMS to degas until air bubbles are no longer visible (typically 30 min).\nCarefully pour the degassed PDMS over the master, to a final PDMS-layer thickness of approximately 5 mm. Degas the PDMS again to ensure the removal of any air bubbles.\nAfter the degassing, bake the PDMS and the master at 80 °C for 80 min.\nCarefully excise the cured PDMS slab from the baked master using a razor blade. Ensure that all cuts are on top of the silicon wafer.\n\t\tNOTE: Any cuts made off the silicon wafer may result in a lip preventing a uniform bonding.\nPunch the inlets and outlets using a 0.75 mm biopsy punch. Remove any dust and stray PDMS using a packaging tape on the feature side of the device.\nPrior to plasma treating the device, clean a 50 mm x 75 mm glass slide by rinsing it with isopropanol and drying it.",
    "For the plasma treatment, place the PDMS slab and glass slide into the plasma bonder with the features facing up. Perform the plasma treatment using 1 mbar O2 plasma for 1 min. Bond the device to the glass slide by bringing the exposed, or face up, sides together.\nFollowing the plasma treatment, bake the device at 80 °C for 40 min.\nFinally, inject glass surface treatment fluid into one of the inlets to render the microfluidic channels hydrophobic. Ensure all channels are completely flooded with the solution and repeat the injection for each dropmaker. Bake the treated device at 80 °C for 10 min to evaporate excess solvent.\n2. Encapsulation of Cells in Agarose Microgels\nNOTE: See Figure 2A.\nPrepare 1 mL of 3% w/v low-melting temperature agarose in 1x Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer. Keep the agarose solution on a 90 °C heat block until immediately prior to the syringe loading.\nPrepare the cell suspension.\n\tNOTE: This protocol and its associated microfluidic devices have been validated to work with bacterial cells, either from a frozen stock or fresh preparation. Mammalian cells, depending on the cell type, may require an adjustment of the microfluidic channel dimensions to accommodate the larger cell sizes.\n\t\nResuspend the cells in 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nCount the cells in a hemocytometer or by flow sorting. For 25 µm microgels with a target cell encapsulation rate of 1 in 10, prepare 1 mL of cell suspension at a final concentration of 2.4 x 107 cells/mL.\nSpin the cells down at 3,000 x g for 3 min. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of 17% v/v density gradient medium (see Table of Materials) in PBS. Keep it on ice until the syringe loading.",
    "Load a 3-mL syringe with fluorinated oil (HFE) containing a 2% w/w perfluoropolyether-polyethylene glycol (PFPE-PEG) surfactant, fit it with a 27 G needle, and place it into a syringe pump.\n\tNOTE: Fit all syringes with a 27 G needle for the microfluidic steps in this protocol. To reduce the risk of accidental pricking, keep caps on all needles until the pump operation begins.\nLoad the cell suspension and molten agarose into 1-mL syringes, fit both with 27-gauge needles, and place these into syringe pumps.\nKeep the agarose syringe and pump warm with a small space heater to prevent the agarose from gelling in the syringe and inlet tubing. Set the space heater to HIGH and position it so that the heating surface is about 10 cm away from the syringe. Ensure that the temperature measured at the syringe is approximately 80 °C.\n\tNOTE: Users are advised to maintain the heater at the recommended distance from the pumping apparatus to reduce the risk of equipment damage, including melting of the tubing.\nGenerate 25 µm microgel drops using the co-flow dropmaking device.\n\tNOTE: See Figure 3A for a device schematic indicating the location of the reagent inlets and outlet.\n\t\nConnect the syringe needles to the microfluidic device inlets using pieces of polyethylene (PE) tubing. Before inserting the tubes into the device, prime the pumps to remove the air from the line.\nConnect a piece of tubing to the outlet and place the free end in a 15 mL collection tube.\nUse the following (recommended) flow rates for dropmaking: 800 µL/h for the HFE 2% w/w PFPE-PEG; 200 µL/h for the cell suspension in PBS; and 200 µL/h for the 3% w/v agarose.",
    "After the dropmaking, place the collection tube at 4 °C for 30 min to ensure the complete gelation of the agarose.\n3. Breaking and Washing the Agarose Microgels\nRemove the lower layer of oil from the collection tube using a 3 mL syringe fitted with a 20 G needle, taking care not to disturb the top layer of the agarose droplets.\nBreak the emulsions with perfluorooctanol (PFO).\nAdd 1 mL of 10% v/v PFO in HFE to the agarose drops. Pipet this solution up and down for 1 min to thoroughly coat the emulsions.\n\t\tNOTE: For all the microgel wash steps, pipet the solutions with a 1,000 µL tip. The microgel suspension should appear homogeneous and free of clumps after pipetting it.\nSpin the conical tube at 2,000 x g for 1 min to collect the agarose microgels. Remove the PFO/HFE supernatant by aspiration; the microgels are now free of their surfactant layer and will appear clear.\nWash the microgels with a surfactant in hexane.\n\tCAUTION: Hexane is a volatile organic solvent, and the wash in step 3.3 should be conducted in a fume hood.\n\t\nAdd 2 mL of 1% v/v sorbitan monooleate nonionic surfactant (see Table of Materials) in hexane to the agarose microgels. Pipet up and down 10x to mix, ensuring the complete breakup of the microgel pellet.\nSpin the tube at 1,000 x g for 1 min to collect the microgels. Aspirate the supernatant to remove the surfactant/hexane solution.\nRepeat the surfactant/hexane wash.\nWash the microgels in an aqueous buffer to remove any residual organic solvent.\nAdd 5 mL of TET buffer [0.1% v/v octylphenol ethoxylate nonionic detergent (see Table of Materials) in 1x TE] to the conical tube. Pipet up and down 10x to mix.",
    "Spin the conical tube at 2,000 x g for 2 min to collect the microgels. Aspirate the supernatant to remove the TET buffer.\nRepeat the TET wash 2x.\nAdd 5 mL of 1x TE buffer to the conical tube. Pipet up and down 10x to mix.\nSpin the conical tube at 2,000 x g for 2 min to collect the microgels. Aspirate the supernatant to remove the TE buffer.\nRepeat the TE wash.\nVerify the cell encapsulation in the microgels under a microscope at a 400X magnification by staining a 10 µL aliquot of gels with 1x nucleic acid stain (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Microgels will appear clear under the transparent channel while cell DNA will fluoresce under the GFP channel (497/520 nm excitation/emission wavelengths). An overlay of transparent and fluorescent channels will show the cells in the microgels as shown in Figure 4A.\n4. Lysis of Cells in Agarose via Lytic Enzymes\nPrepare 1 mL of a lytic enzyme cocktail using 800 µL of TE buffer (1x), 2 µL of yeast lytic enzyme (5 U/µL stock, 10 U/mL final), 30 µL of dithiothreitol (1 M stock, 30 mM final), 60 mg of lysozyme (lyophilized powder), 15 µL of EDTA (0.5 M stock, 7.5 mM final), 2 µL of mutanolysin (100 U/µL stock, 200 U/mL final), 2 µL of lysostaphin (10 U/µL stock, 20 U/mL final), and 30 µL of NaCl (1 M stock, 30 mM final).\nAdd additional TE to bring the volume to 1 mL.

Incubate the mixture at 37 °C for >2 h in a shaker (the maximum is overnight incubation).\n5. Detergent-based Microgel Treatment",
    "Following the lysis via lytic enzymes (step 4), wash the microgels.\nSpin down the microgels at 2,000 x g for 2 min and aspirate the supernatant. The droplets will appear opaque white due to cell debris dispersed in the pellet.\nResuspend the microgels in 5 mL of 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer and pipet up and down 10x to mix.\nSpin the mixture down at 2,000 x g for 2 min, then remove the supernatant by aspiration.\nPerform a detergent treatment on the microgels.\nResuspend the gels in a lithium dodecyl sulfate (LiDS) lysis buffer (0.5% w/v LiDS in 20 mM Tris-HCl) and 60 µL of 0.5 M EDTA to a final volume of 3 mL.\nAdd 5 µL of a Proteinase K enzyme (800 U/mL stock).

    "Repeat the polysorbate 20 wash 3x. Pass the solution through a 100-µm cell strainer prior to the last wash to remove any large clumps.\nResuspend the microgels in 5 mL of 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer to prevent DNA degradation. The microgels may be stored at 4 °C for up to 1 week prior to the tagmentation (step 7).\n6. Generating Barcode Droplets by Digital PCR\nPrepare a 500-pM stock of BAR primer (Table 2) in a 1x TE buffer in a low-bind tube.
