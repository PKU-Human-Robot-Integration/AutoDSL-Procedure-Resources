    "1. Preparation of near-infrared emitting AuNCs (1)\nAdd 7.8 mg (37.8 μmol) thioctic acid (TA) and 60 μL of 2 M NaOH to 23.4 mL of ultrapure water (resistivity 18.2 MΩ.cm at 25 °C) and stir (at least 1,000 rpm) until it dissolves completely (~15-20 min). For faster dissolution of TA, sonicate the mixture. For the synthesis, freshly prepared TA solution is recommended.\nAdd 10.2 μL of HAuCl4·3H2O (470 mg/mL) of aqueous solution to the solution.\nAfter 15 min, add 480 μL of NaBH4 (1.9 mg/mL) under vigorous stirring (at least 1,000 rpm) and stir the reaction mixture under the same conditions overnight.\n\tNOTE: Freshly prepare the NaBH4 solution in ice-cold ultrapure water and add to the reaction mixture immediately after preparation.\n\tNOTE: The synthesis of AuNCs is easily scalable. Up to 2 L of AuNCs was synthesized in a single batch, without any change in the optical properties of the particles.\n(Critical) The next day, purify the solution by applying three cycles of centrifugation/filtration using a membrane filtration device with a molecular weight cut-off of 3 kDa. Without this purification procedure, the following step does not work properly.\nAdd thiol-terminated polyethylene glycol (MW 2,000; 15.6 mg; 7.8 μmol) to the solution, adjust the pH to 7-7.5 and stir the mixture overnight to obtain 1. Purify the dispersion by applying three cycles of centrifugation/filtration using a membrane filtration device with a molecular weight cut-off of 3 kDa.\n\tNOTE: Adjustment of the pH to 7-7.5 is extremely important. Higher pH can result in a blue shift of emission maxima.\n2. Conjugation of 3-(aminopropyl)triphenylphosphonium bromide (TPP) on the surface of 1\nMix the 1 solution (24 mL) prepared in the previous step and 3-(aminopropyl)triphenylphosphonium bromide (12 mg, ~30 μmol). Adjust the pH to 4.5 with 1 M HCl.",
    "NOTE: 3-(Aminopropyl)triphenylphosphonium (TPP) bromide salt was prepared as described in the literature20.\nStart the reaction by adding an excess of N-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC·HCl) (60 mg, 312 μmol). The pH of the solution will increase and should not be allowed to go beyond 6. Monitor the pH of the reaction mixture for the first hour. If the pH increases above 6, reduce it to 4.5–6 by adding 1 M HCl.\nStir the reaction mixture overnight at room temperature.\nPurify the dispersion by applying three cycles of centrifugation/filtration using a membrane filtration device with a molecular weight cut-off of 3 kDa to obtain 2. Dilute 2 obtained here with ultrapure water to the initial volume of 24 mL. The concentration of Au in the solution is 200 μg/mL.\n3. Cell culture\nCulture HeLa cells (HPA culture collection) in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in 5% CO2 at 37 °C.\nSplit and passage the cells when they reach ~80% confluence. To minimize acquisition of new mutants, the number of cell propagations should not exceed 30.\n4. AuNC internalization into HeLa cells\nSeed the cells in a 12-well plate at a density of 20,000 cells/mL (1 mL/well). The goal is to achieve ~50% confluence after 48 h.\nAt 48 h post-seeding, aspirate the culture medium and add 400 µL of complete culture medium (for untreated controls) or 500 µg of nanoparticles in 400 µL of complete cultured medium (for treated samples) to each well. Return the cultures to a 37 °C incubator.",
    "NOTE: Addition of high volumes of AuNC solution adversely affects the cell viability. AuNC solutions need to be concentrated. Thus 2 obtained in step 2.4 is concentrated 100 times. 40 mL AuNC was concentrated to 400 μL. A 25 μL aliquot of this concentrated solution was added to 400 µL cell culture media to obtain the desired AuNC concentration.\nAfter 2 h of internalization, detach the cells by standard trypsinization according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\nCollect the samples in polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuge for 5 min at 350 x g at 4 °C.\nPrepare the following FCM buffer: pre-chilled phosphate buffered saline (PBS; 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 4.3 mM Na2HPO4, 1.47 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.4) supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C.\nWash the pellets with 1 mL of FCM buffer and centrifuge for 5 min at 350 x g at 4 °C.\nResuspend the pellet in 500 µL of FCM buffer and store samples at 4 °C prior to analysis.\n5. Flow cytometry analysis\nFilter all samples using a 5 mL polystyrene round-bottom tube with a cell-strainer cap.\nBefore acquiring data using the instrument software, specify the cytometer configuration.\nFormat all dot-plots and histograms for ‘Acquisitions’.\nPlot a two-parameter dot plot of the forward scatter area (FSC-A) and side scatter area (SSC-A) to show distribution of cells. To exclude doublets, create a two-parameter dot plot of FSC height (FSC-H) vs. FSC-A. To monitor the relative fluorescence intensity in the sample, plot a single-parameter histogram for the fluorescent channel area (FL-A). Use a linear scale to depict FSC and SSC data, and a logarithmic scale for all fluorescent parameters.",
    "Acquire untreated sample (without nanoparticles) at a low flow rate to minimize coincident events (if allowed by the instrument). During acquisition, adjust the photomultiplier tube (PMT) voltages to get the untreated population on scale on the FSC vs SSC plot. If necessary, adjust PMT voltages for the FL channel to place the unstained population on the left corner of the histogram.\nSelect the specific ‘gate tab’ in the software and draw an appropriate gate around the desired population. Cells inside the gate will move to the next checkpoint.\nRecord 10,000 events per sample.\nRecord all samples under the same instrument settings.\nUse an appropriate program to analyze the flow cytometry data.\n\tNOTE: Some applications might require customized setup of filters. For filter exchange always follow the manufacture’s recommendations in the user guide.\n\tNOTE: The experiment can be saved and reloaded to preserve the instrument settings and gating strategy.\n\tNOTE: A side scatter height (SSC-H) vs. side scatter area (SSC-A) plot can be also used for doublet exclusion. This type of gating can be more sensitive as the FSC detector is not usually a PMT.\n6. Internalization of 2 into HeLa cells for confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM)\nSeed the cells onto a 4-chamber glass bottom 35 mm dish at a density of 250,000 cells/mL (0.5 mL/chamber). Keep the chamber in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 atmosphere. The goal is to achieve ~50% confluence after 24 h.\nAt 24 h post-seeding, add 100 µg of 2 (or 10 µL from the stock solution of 10 mg/mL) to each dish chamber containing 0.5 mL of medium with the cells (for treated samples).\nReturn the dish to the incubator. Let the cells internalize the AuNCs for 24 h prior to using them for CLSM.",
    "After the internalization period, discard the medium and wash the cells with pre-warmed fresh medium for 5 min. Repeat the washing step once more. Then fill each chamber with 800 µL of fresh medium.\n7. CLSM Imaging of live Hela cells labeled with 2\nFor microscopic imaging, use 63x oil (n = 1.518) objective lens (NA = 1.4) in a confocal microscope with Plan-Apochromat.\nMount the dish on the microscope inverted stage with the chamber warmed to 37 °C and supplied with humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.\nTo detect internalized AuNC, use a 405 nm laser set at 2% power with an appropriate beam splitter. Set the range of detection wavelengths between 650 and 760 nm.\nSet the resolution of the image to 2048 x 2048 pixels. In the acquisition speed setting, aim for a pixel dwell time around 4 µs. Acquire the image with 2x averaging (line mode, averaging method mean). Set the pinhole to 1 Airy unit (for 405 nm light). For higher sensitivity, use photon-counting mode.\nFor correct illumination in transmitted light with differential interference contrast (DIC), use Köhler’s setting of the condenser and the field stop. For acquisition of transmitted light, use a 488 nm laser at 0.7% power without any fluorescence detector assigned. Set an appropriate beam splitter for the laser wavelength.\nAcquire two images for each track (red fluorescence and DIC). Track AuNCs by their red fluorescence; cell boundaries are easily determined in the transmitted light with DIC pictures.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
