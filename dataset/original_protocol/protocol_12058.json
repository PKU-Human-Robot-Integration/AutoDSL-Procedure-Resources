    "1. Preparation of Double Stranded RNA (dsRNA) for Shams Knockdown\nPCR amplification of the products\nUse wild-type yellow white (y w) genomic DNA and pAc5.1-EGFP as template and the following primer pairs to amplify the DNA fragments used in dsRNA synthesis. Use the following PCR thermal profile: Denaturation (95 °C, 30 s), Annealing (58 °C, 30 s) and Extension (72 °C, 1 min).\nEnhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) dsRNA primers (5'-3')-\n\t\tForward primer- GAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAG\n\t\tReverse primer- GAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGGTCTTTGCTCAGGGCGG\nShams dsRNA primers (5'-3')-\n\t\tForward primer- TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGAGATGCTGTATGTGGACACGGAT\n\t\tReverse primer- TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGAGATCCGTGGATAACCTTAACGA\n\t\tNOTE: EGFP dsRNA is used as negative control.\nGel-purify the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products using a commercial gel purification kit according to manufacturer's protocol.\nPerform in vitro transcription using a commercial product capable of transcribing from a T7 promoter according to manufacturer's protocol.\nPurify the dsRNA using an RNA purification kit according to manufacturer's protocol and store at -80 °C.\nAssess the efficiency of shams knockdown by using the following steps (1.5.1-1.5.5).\nCount the cells manually using a hemocytometer and plate 5 x 105 S2 cells in each well of a 6 well plate in 1 mL/well of Schneider's medium supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and 100 U/mL Penicillin-Streptomycin.\nAdd 7.5 µg of EGFP- or shams dsRNA to each well and incubate at 25 °C for 24 h.\nHarvest the control (EGFP dsRNA-treated) and shams dsRNA-treated S2 cells by gentle pipetting followed by pelleting down by centrifugation at 1,000 x g for 5 min at 25 °C and process for RNA isolation using an RNA extraction kit according to manufacturer's protocol.\nQuantify the RNA using a spectrophotometer and process 100 ng of RNA for 1-step qRT-PCR using commercial qPCR reagents and primer/probes and the following PCR thermal profile: Denaturation (95 °C, 15 s) and Annealing/Extension (60 °C, 1 min).",
    "NOTE: Please see the Table of Materials for information on the primer/probe sets and the instrument used for shams and control qRT-PCR experiments in these studies.\nCalculate relative shams mRNA levels using the 2-ΔΔCT method16.\n2. Assessment of the Binding Between the Notch Receptor and Trans-ligands\nPrepare signal-receiving cells (S2 cells expressing the Notch receptor).\nCount the cells manually using a hemocytometer and plate 5 x 105 S2 and stable S2-Notch cells in each well of a 6-well plate in 1 mL/well of Schneider's medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 U/mL Penicillin-Streptomycin.\n\t\tNOTE: For S2-Notch cells, which are available from Drosophila Genomics Resource Center (DGRC), add 200 nM methotrexate in media. To prepare a 0.5 mM methotrexate stock solution, first prepare a 20 mM methotrexate solution in 250 µL of 1 M NaOH. Next, dilute this solution to 0.5 mM in 1 M phosphate buffer saline and store at -20 °C. In S2-Notch cells, expression of the Notch protein is under the control of the Drosophila metallothionein promoter in the pMT vector.\nAdd 7.5 µg of dsRNA to each well and incubate at 25 °C for 24 h.\nAdd 0.7 mM CuSO4 to induce the expression of Notch and incubate at 25 °C for 3 days.\n\t\tNOTE: CuSO4 is used to induce expression of proteins controlled by the metallothionein promoter.\nPrepare signal-sending cells (S2 cell expressing Delta or Serrate ligands).\nCount the cells manually using a hemocytometer and plate ~5 x 106 stable S2-Delta or S2-SerrateTom cells in each well of a 6-well plate in 1 mL/well of Schneider's medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 U/mL Penicillin-Streptomycin.",
    "NOTE: Add 200 nM methotrexate for S2-Delta cells and 100 µg/mL hygromycin for S2-SerrateTom cells in media. Expression of Delta and SerrateTom—a Tomato-tagged, functional version of Serrate12—is under Drosophila metallothionein promoter in the pMT vector.\nAdd 0.7 mM CuSO4 to induce the expression of ligands and incubate at 25 °C for 3 h.\nPerform aggregation between signal-sending and signal-receiving cells.\nHarvest the dsRNA-treated S2 (control) and S2-Notch cells by gentle pipetting and plate 2.5 x 105 cells/well in a 24-well plate after manual counting by hemocytometer.\nAdd 5 x 105 stable S2-Delta or S2-SerrateTom cells in a total volume of 200 µL of Schneider's medium (supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 U/mL Penicillin-Streptomycin).\n\t\tNOTE: All S2 cells handling (including plating, induction and dsRNA treatment) was done under a biosafety cabinet.\nPlace the plate on an orbital shaker at 150 rpm (942.48 rad/min).\nAfter 1 min, mix the contents of each well and take 20 µL out for counting the number of aggregates.\n\t\t\nSimultaneously take a representative image under inverted compound microscope using 10x magnification (PLL 10/0.25 objective).\nManually count the aggregates (>6 cells) using a hemocytometer.\nPlace the plate on a shaker.\nRepeat the image acquisition and counting after 5 min and 15 min of aggregation.\nPerform quantification of trans-binding.\nCalculate the number of aggregates per mL between S2 cells and S2-Delta or S2-SerrateTom cells as a background control.\nCalculate the number of aggregates per mL between S2-Notch and S2-Delta or S2-SerrateTom cells (magnitude of trans-binding).\n3. Evaluation of Inhibition of Binding Between Notch and Trans-ligands by Cis-ligands\nPrepare signal-receiving cells.\nPlate 5 x 105 S2 cells in each well of a 6-well plate in 1 mL/well of Schneider's medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 U/mL Penicillin-Streptomycin.",
    "Add 7.5 µg of dsRNA to each well and incubate at 25 °C for 24 h.\nCo-transfect the dsRNA-treated cells with pBluescript and pMT-Notch11 (DGRC) alone or with pMT-Notch and pMT-Delta11 (DGRC) or pMT-Serrate17 for a total DNA concentration of 2 µg/well using a commercial transfection reagent according to manufacturer's protocol.\n\t\tNOTE: pBluescript is used as a control. The co-transfected cells will be called S2-Notch&Deltatransient or S2-Notch&Serratetransient cells hereafter.\nIncubate the transiently-transfected S2 cells at 25 °C for 24 h.\nAdd 0.7 mM CuSO4 to induce the expression of Notch and the ligands and incubate at 25 °C for 3 days.\nPrepare signal-sending cells as described in 2.2.\nPerform aggregation between signal-sending and signal-receiving cells as described in section 2.3.\nQuantify inhibition of trans-binding by cis-ligands.\nCalculate the number of aggregates per mL between S2 cells and S2-Delta or S2-Serrate cells as a background control.\nQuantify the magnitude of inhibition by cis-ligands as follows.\n\t\t\nDefine A as Number of aggregates between S2-Notchtransient and S2-Delta cells.\nDefine B as Number of aggregates between S2 cells transiently co-transfected with Notch and Delta (S2-Notch&Deltatransient) and S2-Delta cells.\nCalculate relative aggregation C = (B x 100)/A\nCalculate magnitude of inhibition by cis-ligand (Delta or Serrate) as 100 – C.\n\t\t\tNOTE: As an example, if relative aggregation is 45%, then cis-ligands are considered to inhibit the trans-binding by 55%.\nSubscription Required.
