  "procedures": [
    "1.\tSubject Preparation \nMeasure  subject's height, weight, and record their age. \nAssess  the subject's preferred treadmill speed by having them self-adjust treadmill speed  until comfortable.\nUsing  a felt tip pen, mark the vertex of the head as the midpoint between the nasion  and inion of the subject. Additionally,  mark 10% of the nasion to inion distance as a reference for aligning the cap.\n2.\tScalp Electroencephalography (EEG) \nAttach  EEG electrodes as specified by the 10-20 international system using an EEG cap  fitted to the subject as in  12. The  cap ensures proper placement of the electrodes on the scalp.\nPlace  the EEG cap on the subject by aligning the 10% mark from step 1.3 at the  midpoint of the Fp1 and Fp2 electrodes and the Cz electrode with the marked  vertex. More details for placement of  the cap are found in  12. Secure the  cap by strapping below the chin.\nConnect  EEG electrodes to the EEG control box.  Starting with ground and reference electrodes, use a small syringe to inject  electrolyte gel in each electrode until impedance of each measures below 25 kΩ  as indicated by electrode LED turning green.  Further details on EEG electrode preparation are available in  12,13.\nConnect  the EEG electrodes to the wireless EEG transmitter. Secure the transmitter to the subject on a  Velcro strap placed around the shoulders and connect the wireless EEG receiver  to two 32 channel amplifiers.\nConnect  the amplifiers to the host PC via a USB port using a fiber-optic to USB  converter.\nSet  EEG channel resolution to 0.1 μV, low cutoff frequency to DC, and high cutoff  frequency to 1,000 Hz in the EEG data collection software.\n3.\tSurface Electromyography (EMG)",
    "Prepare  for EMG electrode placement at 8 muscle sites: shave skin, abrade with  sandpaper, and clean with an isopropyl alcohol pad. Place electrodes on prepared sites and  connect to EMG data logging unit. Place EMG ground electrode on left or right  wrist, and connect to data logging unit.\n4.\tMotion Capture\nSynchronize  MARG sensors while docked according to manufacturer's instructions.\nRemove  MARG sensors and place on the subject using Velcro straps or double sided tape  at locations in  Table 2. \n5.\tEnvironment Preparation\nPrepare  treadmill by taping a diagonal line (45° from horizontal) on the  belt. Place a television monitor  connected to a video camera approximately 1 m in front of the treadmill. Tape a piece of paper with a 2 inch diameter  black circle on the television.\nSetup  walking arena by placing 5 sets of IR proximity sensors, cones, and television  screen as located in Figure 3. \n6.\tTreadmill \nSubject  ascends onto treadmill. Attach safety harness.\nPrior  to data collection, examine EEG and EMG signals to verify correct electrode  placement, electrode connection, and data transmission.\nBegin  data collection by running the C++ console application. Press the manual  trigger push button to initiate EMG recording and give an audio cue (beep) to  start the experiment.\nThe  subject stays in quiet stance for 30 sec.\nAfter  30 sec push trigger button to initiate walking; the treadmill is slowly  accelerated to the subject's pre-selected speed.\nThe  subject walks for 5 min.\nAt  the end of 5 min, push trigger button to initiate walk to stand transition  by slowly stopping the treadmill. After  coming to a stop the subject remains standing for 30 sec. Press the 'q'  button to stop data collection trial and save the data.\nRepeat  steps 6.2-6.7 for all three treadmill conditions:",
    "Treadmill  walking while looking at black dot in distance.\nTreadmill  walking while observing motion of own legs on TV monitor.\nTreadmill  walking while using video feedback to avoid diagonal line on treadmill (to  simulate cognitive load  6).\n7.\tArena Walking (1)\nPosition  subject at the start of the arena walking loop (Figure 3).\nBegin  data collection as in 6.2-6.4.\nPush  the trigger button to initiate walking.  At the time the trigger is given, the first directional arrow (→, ←, or  ↑) is displayed on the screen opposite the subject (Figure 3). If → or ← is observed, the subject exits the  entrance set of cones, turns 90° in that direction, completes the  loop and returns to the entrance cones.  If ↑is observed, the subject continues straight out of the entrance  cones and a manual trigger and direction arrow (→ or ←) is given when the  subject reaches approximately 2 meters before the IR sensors. The subject proceeds through the first set of  IR sensors and then makes the corresponding 90° turn to complete the  loop, returning to the entrance cones.  (During walking, the experimenter follows the subject at a distance of  approximately 3-5 meters with the host PC on a wheeled cart to enhance wireless  signal quality.)\nThe  subject continues walking when he/she reaches the entrance cones after  completing a single loop. Sequence 7.3  is repeated with random ordering of arrows until 3 loops have been completed  for each initial arrow (→, ←, or ↑).\nAfter  satisfying condition 7.4, push the manual trigger button when subject reaches  the entrance cones to signal transition to standing. Subject stands quietly for 30 sec and  then data collection is terminated by pressing the 'q' button on the host PC.\n8.\tArena Walking (2)",
    "Rearrange  arena walking course so that the five sets of IR sensors are positioned in a semi-circle  in front of the subject (Figure 4).\nBegin  data collection as with the previous trials (7.1-7.2).\nSimilar  to Arena Walking I, give a manual trigger to initiate walking. At the time of the trigger, one of 5  direction arrows (←, →, imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50602/50602larr.jpg, imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50602/50602rarr.jpg, or ↑) is displayed on the screen. Each arrow corresponds to one set of IR  sensors which are positioned around the arena (Figure 4).\nThe  subject observes the arrow on the screen and walks to the corresponding set of  IR sensors, making a U-turn around the cone beyond the sensors, passing through  the sensors twice (Figure 4). After  making the U-turn, the subject returns to the starting point and continues  walking.\nRepeat  sequence 8.3-8.4, with random ordering of arrows, until 3 loops have been  completed for each directional arrow.\nAfter  satisfying condition 8.6, push the manual trigger button when the subject  reaches the starting point to signal transition to standing. Complete data collection as in 7.5.\n9.\tSit to Stand\nPosition  a chair behind the subject and begin data collection as in 6.2-6.3. The subject  stands quietly for 15 sec at the start of data collection.\nAfter  15 sec, press the manual trigger button. After hearing cue subject  transitions from stand to sit posture, holding sitting position until the next  audio cue (button push).\nWait  a random interval (5-15 sec) and press manual trigger to give cue for sit  to stand transition. Standing posture is  held until the next audio cue.\nRepeat  9.2-9.3 until 10 complete stand-to-sit and sit-to-stand maneuvers are complete,  after which the subject stands quietly for 15 sec. Then, terminate data  collection by pressing 'q' button.",
    "Repeat  the stand-to-sit protocol (9.1-9.4) for self-initiated stand-to-sit and sit-to-stand transition.  Rather than giving the subject a trigger to transition, have the subject  initiate the transfer own their own until 10 of each maneuver is complete.\n10.\tHallway Walking  \nPosition  subject and data collection cart in the middle of 1/8th mile,  straight hallway. Begin data collection  as with the treadmill walking experiments (6.2-6.4). After the initial 30 sec resting period,  give a manual trigger to initiate walking.\nThe  subject walks continuously for 5 min.  When the subject reaches within 10 meters of the hallway end, he/she  self-initiates a U-turn and continues walking in the opposite direction.\nAt  the end of 5 min push the manual trigger button to stop walking. The  subject stands quietly for 30 sec while looking straight ahead. Terminate  data collection by pressing the 'q' button.\nBegin  a second hallway experiment as in 10.1.\nAfter  a random time interval of walking (20-40 sec), give a manual trigger and  audio cue to have the subject stop walking.\nThe  subject remains standing for short, random duration (5-15 sec).\nPush  the manual trigger button to have subject resume walking.\nRepeat  steps 10.5-10.7 until 10 cycles of stop-start are complete; terminate data  collection as in 10.3."
