    "Isolation of human RBCsCollect a sample of human venous blood in a test-tube with anticoagulant (BD Vacutainer spray coated K2EDTA tube).Dilute the human venous blood sample 1:10 with Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS).Wash the human venous blood sample for three times in DPBS (800 x g for 10 min at 4 °C) to remove serum and cellular buffy coat.Resuspend the resulting pellet of RBCs in DPBS to attain 1% hematocrit.Assessment of RBCs glycerol permeability by SFLSPrepare two solutions: A) isotonic solution of 1× DPBS (300 mOsM) and B) hypertonic solution consisting of 1× DPBS added with glycerol (final osmolarity: 500 mOsM).Verify the osmolarity of the above reported solutions by using an osmometer. Mixing of solutions A and B will result in a 100 mM inwardly direct gradient of glycerol.Set up the stopped-flow light scattering device (Figure 1) as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200816/20200816031510_1967.pngFigure 1. Stopped-flow light scattering apparatus. The SFM-20 injection system coupled to a spectrophotometer is an ideal system for 90° light scattering assays. In this protocol, the SFLS apparatus is employed for the assessment of erythrocyte glycerol permeability. The SFM-20 injection driving motor triggers the syringe pistons allowing the solutions to pass simultaneously into the mixing chamber directly connected to an observation cell irradiated with a xenon source lamp. With the SFM-20’s driving control of the total flow rate shear forces are minimized. A synchronized electro-valve stops the sample flow and prevents the occurrence of overpressure artifacts. All the data collected by a detector are then analyzed by the software Bio-Kine 32.Set the cryostat temperature at 20 °C;Initialize the injection system and the spectrophotometer by the MPS-20 and Bio-Kine 32 software, respectively;Set the SFLS apparatus using the following MPS-20 parameters (Figure 2):Dead time (time required for the solutions to flow from the mixing chamber to the observation cell): 1.",
    "6 ms;99% mixing efficiency in < 1 ms;Mixing time: 20 ms;Volume injected by syringe 1: 100 μl;Volume injected by syringe 2: 100 μl;Set the excitation and emission wavelengths on the spectrophotometer to 530 nm. The bandwidth of excitation and emission must be set to 20 nm.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200816/20200816031912_4675.pngFigure 2. SFM-20 software for single mixing applications. SFM-20 is set up for rapid and easy SFLS experimental design. The user sets the mixing ratio, the size of syringes and cuvette, and the volume samples. Color-coded windows display calculated values and alert the user to out of range experimental conditions. The estimated dead time is automatically displayed, and a pretrigger is also available to be sure the stationary state is reached accurately. Equilibrate 15 μl of RBCs suspension in 2.5 ml of isotonic DPBS for 5 min and then fill one of the two syringes with the cell suspension.Fill the other syringe with the hypertonic solution (DPBS added of glycerol, final osmolarity: 500 mOsM).Inject the erythrocyte suspension together with the hypertonic solution (osmotic gradient, 100 mOsM) into a mixing chamber. As a result of a glycerol gradient, at first, a rapid water outflow occurs leading to cell shrinkage and causing an increase in scattered light intensity (I) over time (s) (Figure 3), subsequently, as a consequence of the glycerol entry, water flows into the cells causing cell swelling whose kinetics is displayed as decrease in scattered light intensity (I) over time (s) (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200816/20200816031932_5871.pngFigure 3. Stopped-flow light scattering measurements of erythrocyte glycerol permeability. The addition of extracellular glycerol causes a rapid increase in the intensity of scattered light due to the water efflux induced by the osmotic gradient (shrinkage) followed by a slower scattered light decrease (swelling) induced by the osmotic influx of water the accompanies the entry of glycerol into the cells.",
    "Glycerol permeability is calculated by measuring the exponential time constant (imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200816/20200816053121_0998.jpeg, s) fitted to the cell swelling phase of the 90° light scattering time course associated to the influx of glycerol and water.By using the Bio-Kine 32 software, fit the data to a single exponential function and measure the time rate constant (imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200816/20200816054729_6108.jpeg, s) of the cell swelling phase during the entry phase of glycerol and water into the erythrocytes (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200816/20200816031950_0406.pngFigure 4. Bio-Kine 32 for data acquisition and analysis. Acquisition and analysis of signals produced by SFLS device are carried out using the Bio-Kine 32 software. Bio-Kine 32 has been designed to complement the SFM-20 software and to connect the spectrometer to the mixing device.For the inhibition studies (Figure 5), dissolve the compounds in DMSO as previously reported, add the right volume of inhibitor solution to the erythrocyte suspension and incubate for 10 min at 20 °C prior to the measurements of light scattering. The final concentration of HTS13286, DFP00173 and Z433927330 is 25 μM in 1% DMSO. Carry out all the inhibition assays while keeping the final concentration of DMSO constant at 1%. To keep constant the concentration of DMSO needed for inhibition studies, prepare a series of DMSO solutions of the drug with different concentrations, and do the same dilution with the buffer solution, in this way is possible to get buffer solutions of different drug concentrations while maintaining the same percentage of DMSO.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200816/20200816032012_9619.pngFigure 5. Inhibition studies of glycerol transport across erythrocyte plasma membrane. Stopped-flow light scattering technique is a valuable tool for assessing water and solute movement across biological membranes and the characterization of pharmacokinetic properties (efficiency, specificity, potency) of protein channels and carrier inhibitors, as well.",
    "Representative tracings of glycerol permeation into human red blood control cells (no inhibitor) or incubated for 10 min with two different concentrations of each inhibitor, one blocking mostly the glycerol-facilitated diffusion and the other being ineffective. A significant inhibition of glycerol permeability is seen adding 25 μM of all three inhibitors, HTS 13286 (A), DFP00173 (B) and Z433927220 (C) compared to the control cells (1% DMSO).RBCs suspensions incubated with 1% DMSO (solvent of all the three inhibitors) (10 min at 20 °C as well as the experimental conditions) represent the control condition.Calculation of the glycerol permeability coefficient (Pgly, cm/s).The osmotic water influx following glycerol entry into the erythrocytes and therefore the resulting swelling leads to a decrease of the scattered light intensity over time (Figure 2). Calculate the glycerol permeability coefficient (Pgly, cm/s) by measuring the imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200816/20200816034623_2544.jpeg value (using the Bio-Kine 32 software), exponential time constant fitted to the data related to the cell swelling phase of the curve, and using the following equation: imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200816/20200816032043_6157.jpeg      where S/V is the surface-to-volume ratio of the analyzed RBCs.A practical example for the calculation of the Pgly of the RBC plasma membrane is described below:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200816/20200816032130_3558.jpeg where S/V is the initial surface/volume ratio of RBCs. Assuming that the cell shape is roughly spherical and the cell outer surface is regular and completely smooth, S/V may be obtained as follows:where r is the cell radius.The above Pgly equation can now be also written as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200816/20200816032339_3551.jpeg The RBC mean radius is of 4 x 10-5 cm and the imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200816/20200816034657_6973.jpeg value corresponds to the reciprocal of a time constant, Ki (s-1), calculated from the exponential fitting of the SFLS traces (imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200816/20200816053402_2335.jpegRBC = 1/Ki (RBC) = 1/0.110 s-1 = 9.0 s). The Pgly value is then calculated as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200816/20200816032444_6974.jpeg"
