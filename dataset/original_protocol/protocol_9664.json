    "1. Recombinant caspase expression in bacteria\nClone the gene of interest (Caspase or putative substrate) into a bacterial expression vector with N- and/or C-terminal tag(s) using standard protocols23.\n\tNOTE: Tags can increase the solubility of the recombinant proteins and are used for purification of the recombinant proteins. Here, Dronc, Drice, and their catalytic mutants are cloned into the vector pET28a, which provides an N-terminal 6xHis tag (pET28a-6xHis-Droncwt, pET28a-6xHis-DroncC318A, pET28a-6xHis-Dricewt, pET28a-6xHis-DriceC211A); (for primer information see Supplementary Table 1).\nTransform the vectors with the genes of interest into competent BL21 (DE3) pLysS E. coli cells using standard procedures23,24. Plate the transformation mixture on LB agar plates with the appropriate antibiotic (kanamycin in case of pET28a) to select transformed bacteria. (Refer to Supplementary Table 2.)\nPick a colony from the plate and inoculate in 5 mL of LB medium containing the appropriate antibiotic to grow overnight at 37 ˚C at 220 rpm on a shaking platform.\nOn the next day, prepare 30-50 mL (per sample) of LB medium with antibiotic and add 1 mL of the overnight grown culture. The optical density at 600 nm (OD600) using a bio photometer/spectrophotometer should be between 0.1 and 0.2.\nGrow the culture at 37 ˚C at 220 rpm on a shaking platform until OD600 reaches 0.6. Check the OD600 every hour until it reaches 0.6. This takes about 2 to 3 h.\nTo induce protein (caspase) expression, add IPTG to a final concentration of 0.1-0.2 mM (dilute 1:1,000-1:500 from IPTG stock, see Supplementary Table 2).\nGrow the cultures for 3 h at 30 ˚C at 220 rpm.\n\tNOTE: Time and temperature are dependent on what kind of protein is being expressed and its solubility. These conditions may need to be adjusted if different caspases or substrates are expressed.",
    "After 3 h, spin down the cultures in 50 mL centrifuge tubes for 20 min at 4 ˚C at 2,000 x g. Discard the supernatant and proceed with the pellet.\n\t​NOTE: The protocol can be stopped at this point and continued later. Bacterial pellets can be frozen at -80 ˚C.\n2. Small-scale recombinant caspases extraction\nRemove the frozen tubes with the pelleted cultures from -80 ˚C storage and keep them on ice for 10 min to soften the pellet.\nAfter 10 min, add 0.6 mL of bacterial cell lysis buffer (Supplementary Table 2) supplemented with freshly added protease inhibitors, 10 mg/mL of lysozyme and 50 U/mL of benzonase into the pellet-containing tubes using a pipette controller with a 1 mL serological pipette.\nWith the same pipette tip, dissolve the pellet by pipetting up and down until a clear pale-yellow solution without any pellet particles is visible. Incubate for 30 min on ice.\nTransfer the lysate into appropriate centrifuge tubes and centrifuge the lysates at 17,000 x g for 40 min at 4 ˚C.\nTransfer the supernatants into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. This is the crude extract containing the caspases.\nKeep the tubes on ice and proceed for purification with Ni-NTA agarose.\n3. Small-scale His-tagged caspases purification\nAdd 0.2 mL of the 50% slurry of Ni-NTA agarose to each tube of the caspase extracts from step 2.5. Rotate the tubes on an end-on-end rotator for 1 h at 4 ˚C.\nAfter 1 h, add the extract with the Ni-NTA agarose to 1 mL polypropylene columns with the tip intact, placed in a rack. Let it stand for 5 min.\nAfter 5 min, remove the cap of the columns and let the supernatant flow out by gravity flow.",
    "Carefully add 1 mL of the wash buffer (Supplementary Table 2) to the columns without disturbing the packed resin of Ni-NTA agarose and wash it through gravity flow.\nPerform the washing step three times.\nFor elution of the caspases, place 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes under the collecting nozzle of the columns after complete draining of the wash buffer.\nAdd 0.5 mL of the elution buffer (supplemented with 1x protease inhibitors immediately before use) to each column and collect the eluate in the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\n\tNOTE: The fine purified eluate will be transparent in color.\nKeep the eluates on ice and measure the concentration of proteins by Bradford assay25. Confirm purity/homogeneity of the purified caspases by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining26.\n\t​NOTE: The yield of a 50 mL LB culture ranges between 0.5 and 1.5 mg of caspase protein. Given that 0.5 mL of elution buffer is used for elution, the concentration ranges from 1 to 3 mg/mL. It is important to use the purified caspase eluates for in vitro cleavage assays on the same day of lysis and purification as these caspase preparations lose activity over night.\n4. Expression of the putative caspase substrate in cell-free expression systems\nNOTE: In this protocol, Drice, the natural substrate of Dronc, is prepared by both recombinant expression in E. coli (see section 3 above) and by expression in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL), a mammalian cell-free expression system (this section, see below).\nClone the gene of the putative substrate into an expression vector containing either a T7, T3, or SP6 promoter using standard procedures23.",
    "NOTE: In this protocol, DriceC211A is being used as the model substrate and was cloned into the vector pT7CFE1-N-Myc, which carries a T7 promoter for gene expression and tags the putative protein substrate with an N-terminal Myc-tag for detection by immunoblotting.\nIn RRL, candidate substrates can be synthesized either radioactively or non-radioactively.\n\t\nNon-radioactive synthesis: In a 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, add 25 µL of RRL, 2 µL of reaction buffer, 0.5 µL of Amino Acid Mixture -Minus Leucine (1 mM), 0.5 µL of Amino Acid Mixture-Minus Methionine (1 mM), 1 µL of Ribonuclease Inhibitor (40 U/µL), 2 µL of DNA Template (0.5 µg/µL), and 1 µL of T7-RNA Polymerase. Add nuclease-free water to adjust the final volume of the reaction to 50 µL. Gently mix the components by pipetting or stirring with pipette tip, and spin down briefly.\n\t\tNOTE: The RRL lysate contains 100-200 mg/mL of the endogenous proteins. For in vitro translation reactions, add the RRL at 50% concentration (here 25 µL/50 µL reaction).\nRadioactive synthesis: In a 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, add 25 µL of RRL lysate, 2 µL of reaction buffer, 0.5 µL of Amino Acid Mixture-Minus Methionine (1 mM), 1 µL of Ribonuclease Inhibitor (40 U/µL), 2 µL of DNA Template (0.5 µg/µL), 2 µL of S35-labeled Methionine (1000 Ci/mmol at 10 mCi/mL) and 1 µL of T7-RNA Polymerase. Add nuclease-free water to adjust the final volume of the reaction to 50 µL. Gently mix the components by pipetting or stirring with pipette tip, and spin down briefly. Dispose of tips and tubes in a radioactive waste container.",
    "NOTE: Do not add the Amino Acid Mixture without Leucine. The pT7CFE1 vector uses a T7 promoter for protein expression. Other vectors use T3 or SP6 promoters. In that case, T3 or SP6 RNA polymerases should be used instead of T7 RNA polymerase. Please make sure that the DNA template is of high purity.\nIncubate the reaction at 30 ˚C for 90 min.\nSpin briefly for 10 s and place the tubes on ice. Check the expression level of the putative substrate in RRL by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting/autoradiography.\n\t​NOTE: The amount of RRL extract added to the cleavage reaction should be based on the amount of protein that can be detected by the detection method (either immunoblotting or S35 autoradiography). Proceed to the in vitro cleavage assay (next section) or store it at -80 ˚C.\n5. In vitro cleavage assay with substrates generated with RRL\nTake the putative substrate(s) generated, as described in section 4. In this protocol, N-Myc-DriceC211A is used as model substrate.\nDepending on the expression level of the putative substrate (to be determined separately by immunoblot or autoradiography analysis, see step 4.4), use 1-10 µL of the RRL programmed with the protein of interest in the cleavage assay.\nAdd 10 µg of purified caspase protein generated in sections 1, 2, and 3.\nBring the total reaction volume to 50 µL with caspase assay buffer.\nIncubate the reactions in a water bath at 30 ˚C for 3 h. Make sure to include the appropriate controls in the cleavage assay. Here, the catalytic mutant DroncC318A is used as control.\nAfter 3 h, stop the reactions by transferring the tubes on ice.\nAdd one volume of LDS sample buffer containing 50 mM DTT. The reaction is stopped completely with the addition of LDS sample buffer.",
    "Incubate the samples at 75 ˚C in a heat block for 10 min.\nQuickly spin, mix by flicking, load 24 µL per sample and run the SDS-PAGE (see section 7) or store the samples at -20 ˚C.\n6. In vitro cleavage assay with bacterially expressed recombinant substrate protein\nAdd 10 µg of purified candidate substrate (here 6xHis-DriceC211A, generated in sections 1, 2, and 3) to a 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 10 µg of the purified caspase proteins generated in sections 1 and 2. Bring the total volume to 50 µL by using caspase assay buffer.\nFollow steps 5.5 to 5.9.\n7. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting\nLoad the cleavage reactions (24 µL) onto 4%-12% Tris-Glycine or Bis-Tris gradient gels (Table of Materials) and perform protein electrophoresis and immunoblotting (or autoradiography if using S35-labeled substrates) to visualize results using standard procedures27,28.\n\tNOTE: Here, in this protocol, Bis-Tris gradient gels with Mops running buffer and LDS loading buffer were used. In general, the commonly used PAGE protocols of Tris-Glycine gels run using the Tris-Glycine-SDS running buffer and the SDS-loading buffer work well."
