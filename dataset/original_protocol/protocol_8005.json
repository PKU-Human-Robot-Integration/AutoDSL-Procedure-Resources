    "All methods described here have been approved by the University of Virginia Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Preparation of reagents\nOn the day of surgery, prepare 6.0 mL of injectable quinolinic acid (QA). Dissolve 450 mg of QA in 4.0 mL of 1.0 N NaOH. Add 0.6 mL of 10x PBS, pH to 7.4, and bring to a final volume of 6.0 mL with dH2O. Filter through 0.22 µm syringe filter. The solution is stable for 2 weeks at 4 °C.\nPrepare an aqueous dispersion of microbubbles in normal saline by probe sonication from decafluorobutane gas and stabilize with DSPC/PEG stearate monolayer shell12.\nSize microbubbles by flotation at normal gravity. Determine microbubble concentration and size by electrozone sensing using Multisizer III counter. Microbubble concentration and size distribution should be 6 x 108/mL and ~2 μm (mean particle diameter), respectively. The largest bubbles are removed by flotation exclusion/separation.\nAlternatively, purchase commercially available microbubbles.\n2. Preparation of animals\nAcclimatize the animal (rat or mouse) for 3 days after delivery. The experiments described here used Sprague-Dawley rats (5–6 weeks of age) or telencephalic internal structural heterotopia (tish) rats (local colony).\nHouse the animals under a 12 hour light: 12 hour dark cycle.\nRecord the animals’ weights. This information is important throughout the procedure.\nObtain T2-weighted MR images the day before the FUS procedure in order to establish preoperative baseline images. Use the following parameters for T2 imaging: repetition time/echo time [TR/TE] =3,000/138 milliseconds, 3 averages, field of view=29 x 45 mm2, matrix size = 125 x 192, slice thickness = 0.23 mm.\nAnesthetize the animal with isoflurane (4% induction, 2% maintenance). Confirm adequate depth of anesthesia using a toe pinch. Apply an ophthalmic ointment to the eyes.\nShave the animal’s scalp, and remove the remaining hair with depilatory cream.",
    "Use a tail vein catheter for the infusion of microbubbles, contrast agent, and QA. The catheters consist of a length of PE10 tubing fitted with a 30 G x ½ inch needle. Leave a 1 mL syringe with heparinized saline in line, to be removed and reattached when the line is used for infusions.\n3. MRI and PING procedures\nPerform the MRI on a 7 T MR unit with a gradient strength of 600 mT/m/ms (Figure 1 and Figure 2). Perform MRI acquisitions using a surface coil incorporated in the FUS system.\n\tNOTE: The FUS system used for the experiments comprises three parts: (i) the sonication system is a MR-compatible pre-focused, 8-element annular array, 1.5 MHz transducer (spherical radius = 20 mm ± 2 mm, active diameter = 25 mm (f-number = 0.8), with 80% electric-acoustic efficiency, which is connected to a phased array generator and RF power amplifier; (ii) a MR-compatible motorized positioning stage to move the transducer in the anterior-posterior direction and medio-lateral direction; (iii) a Thermoguide workstation to control the delivery of sonication, including electronic focusing through phase modulation to adjust the focal depth (Figure 2).\nPlace the anesthetized animal on the coil sled assembly (Figure 1) of the MR-compatible FUS system in the prone position. Immobilize the animal using the incisor bar and ear bars incorporated in the cradle of the sled.\nApply acoustic gel to the water-wetted scalp; ensuring that no bubbles exist, place the membrane barrier of the water circulator portion of the transducer assembly above the animal’s skull, and lower the transducer assembly as far as possible in a parallel planar orientation relative to the skull plate. Place the diaphragm of the transducer firmly against the animal’s shaven scalp directly over the skull plate.",
    "Attach a pneumatic sensor to the body with surgical tape, to monitor respiration. Position the pneumatic sensor on the left lower rib cage.\nMove the FUS arm assembly with coil, sled, and animal into the 7T MRI unit (Figure 1).\nRun a T2-scout sequence to determine the general physical position of the transducer assembly relative to the animal’s head, and make mechanical adjustments as necessary (Figure 2). The parameters for T2 imaging are: repetition time/echo time [TR/TE] = 3,000/138 milliseconds, 3 averages, field of view = 29 x 45 mm2, matrix size = 125 x 192, slice thickness = 0.23 mm. Thermometry is typically not used in this protocol.\nObtain T2 images to refine the transducer positioning. Precisely, define the transducer location and specify the focal point(s) of sonication using the targeting function of the software. The parameters for T2 imaging are: repetition time/echo time [TR/TE] = 3,000/138 milliseconds, 3 averages, field of view = 29 x 45 mm2, matrix size = 125 x 192, slice thickness = 0.23 mm.\nJust prior to sonication, inject 300 μL/kg of microbubbles14 via the tail vein.\nUse a 1.5 MHz transducer to produce sonications (30 ms wave packet, 3% duty cycle, 1 Hz burst repetition frequency, 240 s duration/sonication.\nImmediately after sonication, inject gadodiamide contrast agent via the tail vein, and then perform T1-weighted plus contrast scans to confirm opening of the BBB and the accuracy of targeting. The parameters for T1-weighted imaging: TR/TE = 900/12 milliseconds, 2 averages, field of view = 24 x 30 mm2, matrix size = 208 x 256, slice thickness = 0.7 mm. Typically, a single T1 scan is performed.\nRemove the FUS arm and sled from the MRI, and place the animal on a heating pad set to 40 °C, while maintaining 2% isoflurane anesthesia.",
    "Starting 30 min after sonication, use a syringe pump to infuse QA (75 mg/mL stock solution) via the tail vein for 1 h at a rate of 16.8 µL/min to achieve a final dosage of 225 mg/kg (q.s. to 1.0 mL saline).\nWhen the infusion is complete, discontinue anesthesia, keeping the animal on a heating pad until alert. Place the animal in a cage and make routine checks for its activity every 15 min, for several hours after the procedure.\nReturn the animal to the vivarium and check every 6 h for the first day for distress or irregular activity.\nOne day post-sonication, perform T2-weighted MR imaging to assess any damages in the area of sonication. The parameters for T2 imaging: repetition time/echo time [TR/TE] = 3,000/138 milliseconds, 3 averages, field of view = 29 x 45 mm2, matrix size = 125 x 192, slice thickness = 0.23 mm. Images are evaluated for areas of hyperintensity to identify possible tissue damage/edema.\n4. Post-mortem analysis of neuronal loss\nAllow a post-sonication, survival period of 4–5 days for assessing neuronal loss with Fluoro-Jade histochemistry.\nDeeply anesthetize the animal with isoflurane, and euthanize via intracardial perfusion with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer.\nRemove the brain from the skull and post-fix for 2 days in 4% paraformaldehyde.\nImmerse the brain in 30% sucrose for cryoprotection, and cut sections at a thickness of 20–30 μm with a cryostat.\nMount cryostat sections onto gelatinized slides and air-dry overnight.\nRehydrate slides in distilled water, and then dehydrate in ascending graded ethanols. After dehydration, rehydrate slides in descending graded ethanols.\nTransfer slides to a solution of 0.06% potassium permanganate for 15 min on an orbital shaker.",
    "Rinse slides for 1 min in distilled water and transfer to a 0.001% solution of Fluoro-Jade B in 0.1% acetic acid. Incubate under gentle agitation for 30 min at room temperature. Rinse slides three times for 1 min in distilled water.\nDry the slides on a slide warmer, equilibrate in xylenes for 3 min, and coverslip using DPX mounting media.\nSubscription Required.
