    "Worm synchronization and growthTransfer 10-15 N2 wild-type adult worms from a crowded non-starved NGM plate to a fresh 100 mm NGM plate.Let the worms lay eggs overnight at 20 °C.Next day, collect all the worms in the plate in 5 ml of M9W buffer.Filter the worm suspension through a 10 μm pluriStrainer into a 50 ml conical tube. Only L1-stage worms can pass through the filter.Count the number of L1-stage worms that pass through the filter. Put approximately 500 of L1-staged worms on a fresh 100 mm NGM agar plate with an OP50 bacterial lawn. Allow the worms to develop to the late L3 to early L4 stage at 20 °C, about 36 h, before starting the next step at which you will need worms at the young-adult stage.Preparation of E. faecalis plates and control E. coli plates for worm exposure The night before the worms reach the proper stage (young-adult), start an overnight culture of E. faecalis OG1RF in 2 ml of BHI broth and E. coli OP50 in 2 ml of LB broth at 37 °C with shaking.Add 400 μl of the E. faecalis culture to 100 mm BHI agar plates containing 50 μg/ml of gentamycin and spread to create a lawn. Gentamycin prevents the growth of any E. coli transferred over with the worms, as E. faecalis is inherently resistant. Grow at 37 °C for 4-6 h. Additionally, add 400 μl of the E. coli culture to 100 mm NGM agar plates and grow at 37 °C overnight. Make one plate each for every condition you wish to test.Remove the E. faecalis plates from the incubator and allow them to cool to room temperature.Wash the worms (young-adult stage) off from the NGM agar plate by adding 5 ml of M9W buffer.",
    "Transfer the suspended worms into 15 ml conical tubes. Wash the remaining worms off the plates using extra M9W buffer, if necessary. Either let the worms settle to the bottom of the tube or spin them down for one minute at 200 x g. Aspirate the liquid, being careful not to disturb the collected worms. Wash the worms twice with M9W buffer. Transfer worms to E. faecalis (OG1RF) or control E. coli (OP50) plates. Let the plates incubate overnight at 25 °C (about 16 h). This is the standard temperature used when exposing C. elegans to pathogenic bacteria.Preparation of reagents for Amplex Red Assay (enough for 20 reactions)Dilute the 5x reaction buffer that comes with the Amplex® Red assay kit to make a total of 25 ml of working buffer. Thaw a tube of the horse radish peroxidase (HRP) and aliquot 100 μl into 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tubes. One tube should then be aliquoted further into 20 μl volumes, also in microcentrifuge tubes. Keep one 20 μl volume out for immediate use and freeze the rest at -20 °C. Avoid repeated freezing and thawing.Using the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) that comes with the kit, add 60 μl to the Amplex® Red reagent provided in the kit (154 g) and dissolve. Aliquot the dissolved reagent into 11 μl volumes in 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tubes. Leave one tube out for immediate use and freeze the rest at -20 °C.Right before you are ready to begin the assay, add the reagents together with the following volumes: 970 μl 1x reaction buffer, 20 μl HRP, 10 μl Amplex® Red. Mix well and keep in the dark until use. Amplex® Red assay for C. elegans Wash the worms off the E. faecalis and control plates and use 1x reaction buffer to transfer.",
    "Collect the worms in 15 ml tubes suspended in reaction buffer.Let the worms settle to the bottom of the tube or spin them down for one minute at 200 x g. Aspirate the liquid, being careful not to disturb the collected worms. Wash the worms 3-4 times in 1 ml of reaction buffer to get rid of the bacteria.For each sample, transfer the 1 ml of worms and reaction buffer to a 60 mm empty Petri plate. Cut the end of a pipette tip to make the opening larger and, looking under the stereomicroscope, suck up about 15 worms in 25 μl of reaction buffer and transfer to a well of a 96-well plate. Do this twice to obtain 30 +/- 2 worms per 50 μl of reaction buffer/well. Count animals and adjust if necessary. Repeat twice more to generate technical triplicates of the sample. Prepare dilutions in 1x reaction buffer of H2O2 for the standard curve as described in the Amplex® Red kit literature. We use 0 μM, 1 μM, 2 μM, 3 μM, 4 μM and 5 μM as final concentrations. Dispense 50 μl of 2x concentrated H2O2 standards to 96-well plate in duplicate. Desired final concentrations of H2O2 standards will be achieved after adding the same volume of Amplex® red reagent mix. It is recommended that the H2O2-standard wells should be as far as possible from the sample wells in order to prevent interference of volatile H2O2 from high-concentration standard wells into the sample wells. Mix the Amplex® Red reagent, HRP and buffer (Step C4) and add 50 μl to each well of the 96-well plate with the worm samples, controls and standards. Record the time assay begins.",
    "Reading/recording assayUsing a microplate reader, read the fluorescence using 540 +/-20 nm excitation and 590 +/-20 nm emission, bottom optics position and “extended” gain. We use a Biotek Cytation 5 microplate reader with Gen5 software to obtain the data. Measurements are expressed as Relative Fluorescence Units (RFU). See Figure 2 for plate organization and fluorescence readings of a sample experiment designed to test the difference of H2O2 production by worms in the presence of non-pathogenic (E. coli OP50 strain) and pathogenic (E. faecalis OG1RF strain) bacteria as food. Take time points at 30, 60, 120 and 180 min. Generally, the 60-min reading demonstrates the best dynamic range.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191028/20191028032228_4947.jpgFigure 2. Sample plate organization and fluorescence readings. Row “A” has duplicates of increasing concentrations (0-5 μM) of H2O2 for creating the standard curve. Row “E” has technical triplicates of the samples with the worms exposed to E. coli OP50 and E. faecalis OG1RF bacteria. Note that the samples are placed in the wells relatively far from the H2O2 standards. The reading was taken 60 min after mixing the samples with the Amplex Red reagent."
