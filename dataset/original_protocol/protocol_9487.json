    "NOTE: All oxygen- and moisture-sensitive manipulations were carried out under an inert atmosphere (N2) using either standard air-free techniques or a glove box. THF (tetrahydrofuran), Et2O (diethyl ether), CH2Cl2 (dichloromethane), toluene, and pentane were purified by passing through a neutral alumina column under argon. Acetonitrile was dried over CaH2 (calcium hydride) and distilled under nitrogen atmosphere prior to use. Pd/C (palladium on carbon) was heated under high vacuum at 100 °C for 12 h prior to use. Silica gel (230-400 mesh) was dried for 12 h at 180 °C under high vacuum. Flash chromatography was performed with this silica gel under an inert atmosphere. All other chemicals and solvents were purchased and used as received.\nNOTE: Caution, please consult all relevant material safety data sheets (MSDS) before use. Several of the chemicals used in the synthesis are acutely toxic and carcinogenic.\n1. Preparation of 1,2-Azaborines\nNOTE: Characterization data of all compounds in this study have been previously reported12, 13, 16.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55154/55154fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Synthetic scheme of 1,2-azaborines.

Seal the flask with a rubber septum. Outside the box, cool the solution to -78 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere on a vacuum gas manifold.\nAdd 100 mL of 1.00 M boron trichloride solution (100 mmol) in hexane to the triallylborane solution at -78 °C via cannula transfer. Let the reaction mixture stir at this temperature for 4 h.\n\t\t​NOTE: Caution, boron trichloride is highly reactive with water.",
    "In a separate 100 mL flask, measure out 25.7 g N-(t-butyldimethylsilyl)-N-allylamine (150 mmol) and add 20.0 mL dichloromethane. To the 1 L reaction flask, add this solution via cannula transfer maintaining the reaction temperature at -78 °C.\nAdd 21.0 mL triethylamine (150 mmol) to the reaction. Maintain stirring under a positive flow of nitrogen and allow it to gradually warm to room temperature overnight.\nAfter 18 h of stirring, remove approximately one-half of the solvent through a vacuum gas manifold using high vacuum (300-500 mTorr) with a liquid nitrogen trap.\nTake the reaction flask into a glove box and filter off the white salt formed in the reaction mixture through an oven-dried medium-porosity frit equipped with a 24/40 vacuum adaptor and a 24/40 500 mL round-bottom flask with a stir bar. Use dichloromethane to transfer all the remaining materials.\nRemove all the remaining volatiles from the filtrate outside the box using a vacuum gas manifold with high vacuum.\nIn a glove box, transfer the concentrated reaction mixture into an oven-dried 14/20 100 mL round-bottom flask with a stir bar to prepare for distillation. Cap the flask with a septum.\nUnder a flow of nitrogen, quickly open the septum and add 200 mg calcium hydride as a drying agent.\nSet up distillation apparatus by fitting an oven-dried 14/20 distillation head attached with a thermometer, one side with a receiving 14/20 50 mL air-free storage flask and the other side with the 100 mL flask containing crude product. Equip the distillation head with chilled water. (Use grease for all the joints of the distillation apparatus.)\n\t\t​NOTE: The product begins to distill when the vapor temperature reaches 60 °C at 300 mTorr.\nContinue collecting the product by raising the temperature of the oil bath until the distillation head thermometer reads 75 °C.",
    "​NOTE: The product is a clear colorless liquid.\nStop distillation by removing the heat source and cool the apparatus to room temperature prior to storage. Upon cooling, repressurize the apparatus with nitrogen and tightly close the plug valve on the air-free storage flask. Store the isolated product in a glove box freezer.\n\t\tNOTE: The yield can vary from 65% to 84%.\nPreparation of N-TBS-B-Cl ring-closed product (2)\n\t\nIn a glove box, measure out 56.0 g N-allyl-N-TBS-B-allyl chloride adduct (1) (217 mmol) in an oven-dried 24/40 1 L round-bottom flask with a stir bar and add 500 mL toluene.\nMeasure out 1.79 g Grubbs 1st generation catalyst (2.17 mmol).\nAdd the catalyst portion-wise to the stirring solution of 1 at room temperature in a glove box. Purge the box during the addition to remove ethylene gas formed from the reaction.\n\t\tNOTE: The reaction is typically complete within 30 min of the cessation of gas evolution. As another indicator of completion, the reaction color will have completely changed from its initial purple to brown. At this point, the product can be isolated using vacuum distillation; see reference 12 for details. In this protocol, a one-pot, two-step procedure for the direct synthesis of 3 is described.\nPreparation of N-TBS-B-Cl-1,2-azaborine (3)\n\t\nTo the reaction solution of the ring-closed product (2) in toluene, add 14.0 g palladium on carbon (10 wt% Pd, 13.2 mmol).\nRemove the flask from the box and fit it with an oven-dried 24/40 reflux condenser that has been purged with nitrogen and equipped with chilled water.\nHeat the reaction using an oil bath to a vigorous reflux at 135 °C while stirring.",
    "After maintaining at reflux for 16 h, cool the reaction by removing the flask from the oil bath. Upon cooling to room temperature, withdraw a 0.5 mL aliquot from the reaction mixture using a syringe equipped with an oven-dried Luer lock needle. Transfer the 0.5 mL aliquot to a screw-top NMR tube to analyze via 11B NMR12.\n\t\tNOTE: The desired product peak appears at ca. 35.5 ppm12, while the starting material peak appears at ca. 42.9 ppm12. Usually at this point 11B NMR indicates the reaction is incomplete, with a minor starting material peak remaining.\nIf the reaction is incomplete, bring the reaction flask into a glove box and add an additional 3.00 g palladium on carbon (10 wt% Pd, 2.82 mmol).\nResubject the reaction to reflux conditions as described in 1.3.2 and 1.3.3.\nAfter an additional 24 h at reflux, analyze another aliquot of the reaction by 11B NMR. At this point, the reaction should be complete.\nTransfer the reaction flask to the glove box and pass the reaction mixture through a disposable flash chromatography column packed with paper wipes. Collect the filtrate by washing with 50.0 mL of toluene.\nRemove all the volatiles from the filtrate outside the box on a vacuum gas manifold equipped with high vacuum.\n\t\t​NOTE: Removal of the volatiles can take 40 min to 90 min depending on the vacuum pressure. When the vacuum gauge reads maximum pressure, it indicates that the removal of solvent is complete. While removing solvent, make sure that the water bath underneath the flask remains at room temperature for heat dissipation.\nIn a glove box, transfer the concentrated reaction mixture into an oven-dried 24/40 250 mL round-bottom flask with a stir bar. Cap the flask with a septum.",
    "Quickly remove the septum and add 200 mg calcium hydride as a drying agent.\nSet up distillation apparatus by fitting an oven-dried 24/40 distillation head attached with a thermometer, one side with a receiving 24/40 100 mL air-free storage flask and the other side with the 100 mL flask containing crude product. Equip the distillation head with chilled water. Use grease for all the joints of the distillation apparatus.\n\t\tNOTE: The product begins to distil when the vapor temperature reaches 65 to 70 °C at 1,000 mTorr with an oil bath temperature between 90-100 °C. The product is a clear colorless liquid.\nStop distillation by removing the heat source and cool the apparatus to room temperature prior to storage. Upon cooling, repressurize the apparatus with nitrogen and tightly close the plug valve on the air-free storage flask. Store the isolated product in a glove box freezer at -30 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The yield for the one-pot, two-step procedure is 52%.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55154/55154fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: 11B NMR spectra for monitoring formation of N-TBS-B-Cl-1,2-azaborine (3).

Measure out 1.14 g acetamide (19.3 mmol) and transfer to the reaction flask. Seal the flask with a rubber septum.",
    "Remove the reaction flask from the box and fit with an oven-dried 24/40 reflux condenser that has been purged with nitrogen and equipped with chilled water.\nHeat the reaction to reflux at 85 °C in an oil bath with stirring.\nAfter 3 h at reflux, cool the reaction by removing the flask from the oil bath. Upon cooling to room temperature, remove the solvent on a vacuum gas manifold equipped with high vacuum.\nAfter removing the volatiles under vacuum, redissolve the reaction residue in 15.0 mL THF. To this solution add 3.21 mL of n-butanol (35.1 mmol).\nStir the reaction at room temperature for 1 h.\nRemove the solvent on a vacuum gas manifold equipped with high vacuum to obtain the crude product.\nIn a glove box, isolate the product via silica gel column chromatography, using a mixture of pentane and diethyl ether (5:1) as eluent.

Seal the flask with a rubber septum and place under N2 on a vacuum gas manifold.\nIn a separate oven-dried 100 mL round bottom flask, add 26.5 mL of ethyllithium solution (0.5 M in benzene/cyclohexane, 13.2 mmol) under nitrogen atmosphere. Remove the mixture of the solvent (benzene/cyclohexane) from the ethyllithium reagent to avoid issues with isolating the desired azaborine product. Redissolve the solid ethyllithium in 13.0 mL Et2O.",
    "​NOTE: Caution: Organolithium reagents are pyrophoric (ignitable on contact with air or water). The desired product (5) is particularly volatile (MW= 106.96). Therefore, removal of benzene/cyclohexane solvent from ethyllithium reagent is required for effective isolation of the pure product due to the similar volatility with the desired product.\nCool the reaction flask containing 4 to -30 °C with a cooling bath.\nAdd the ethyllithium solution to the reaction flask via cannula transfer at -30 °C. Keep stirring at this temperature for 1 h and allow it to slowly warm to room temperature.\nMonitor the reaction by 11B NMR. (The desired intermediate peak appears at ca. 39.8 ppm.)\nUpon reaction completion, cool the reaction to -30 °C and add 6.62 mL HCl solution (2.0 M in Et2O, 13.2 mmol). Stir the reaction for 1 h while allowing it to slowly warm to room temperature.\nRemove the solvent on a vacuum gas manifold equipped with low vacuum (20-25 Torr) to obtain the crude product mixture.\nIn a glove box, isolate the product via silica gel column chromatography, using 2-methylbutane as eluent.

Place the dialysis tubing into a beaker containing 4.00 L of 100 mM sodium phosphate, 550 mM NaCl, 0.02% NaN3 (pH 6.5 for L99A and pH 6.3 for L99A/M102). Stir the 4 L solution overnight at 4 °C.\nAdd 2-mercaptoethanol (final concentration of 5 mM) to the dialyzed sample and concentrate to ~40.0 mg/mL using a centrifugal concentrator (10,000 MWCO). Determine the protein concentration by measuring absorption at 280 nm. Remove any precipitate by spinning prior to crystallization.\nUse the vapor-diffusion hanging-drop method for protein crystallization.
