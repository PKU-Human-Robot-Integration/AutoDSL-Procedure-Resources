  "procedures": [
    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nPrevious protocols for exocrine cell isolation and culturing (Gout et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) or isolation and adenoviral infections (Geron et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) were published. Here, we optimized an ex vivo protocol for isolation, adenoviral infection and culturing of primary exocrine cells for up to 8 days. This protocol allows studies of mechanisms underlying acinar to β-cell reprogramming by adenoviral expression of PDX1, NGN3 and MafA (PNM). It can be used to test the effects of various conditions on reprogramming efficiency and cell functionality. Conditions that can be manipulated include chemical/hormonal treatments, adenoviral overexpression or silencing of studied genes, the use of transgenic mouse lines, temporal changes in reprogramming etc. Use of cells isolated from a reporter mouse line for insulin such as MIP- GFP, permits enrichment for reprogrammed cells, as we previously demonstrated (Elhanani et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Isolated cells from such a mouse line can also be used to set up a system for high throughput screen of compounds that affect reprogramming efficiency. Furthermore, this protocol can be used for other applications that require pancreatic exocrine cell isolation and their culturing after adenoviral infections.\nIsolation of Primary Pancreatic Exocrine Cells\nTiming: 3 h\nThis stage allows the isolation of pancreatic exocrine cell clusters and their infection with adenoviral vectors to induce their reprogramming to insulin- or somatostatin-expressing cells. As we wish to study the formation of newly formed insulin-positive cells, this protocol includes a stage for elimination of native β cells by treatment with the β cell toxin alloxan. This protocol can be used for applications other than studies of β cell reprogramming. In this case, alloxan treatment is not required as native β cells comprise a small fraction of pancreatic cells and will not interfere with most other applications.",
    "Sacrifice the desired number of mice (8–12 week old) by cervical dislocation (in accordance with local IACUC guidelines).\nPlace on ice a 6-well plate containing 4 mL of cold HBSS wash solution per well.\nDissect the mouse and excise the pancreas into a single well.\nWash the tissue in the well and transfer to a new well containing cold HBSS wash solution.\nRepeat steps 3–4 for the desired number of mice. Do not let tissues stand on ice for longer than 30 min.\nTransfer one pancreas into 60 mm tissue culture plate containing 5 mL of cold collagenase solution. Mince the tissue with scissors (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) and gently transfer to a 50 mL conical tube using 1 mL pipettor trimmed at the end (to reduce shear forces on the cells, Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). Place the conical tube in ice while processing the remaining pancreata.\nIncubate for 12 min at 37°C. After the first 4 min of incubation, and every 2 min until the end of the incubation: pipette the tissues gently five times up and down using 1 mL trimmed pipette.\nCritical: Collagenase digestion is a critical stage as over-digestion of the tissue can impair cell viability (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D) and reprogramming efficiency. Batch to batch variation in collagenase may affect its activity and the time of digestion may require calibration to optimize viability at the end of the protocol.\nTo each tube (one digested pancreas in each tube), add 45 mL of ice cold HBSS wash solution.\nPerform two washes by centrifugation of the cells at 200 × g for 3 min followed by aspiration of the supernatant and adding an additional 45 mL of HBSS wash solution. After the first wash, the desired number of pancreata can be combined in a single 50 mL conical tube.",
    "Gently resuspend the pellet in 5 mL HBSS wash solution using 1 mL trimmed pipette and then add HBSS wash solution to a total volume of 30 mL.\nTo obtain desirable size of cell clusters and to remove clumps of undigested tissue, filter through a standard metal tea strainer followed by filtration through a 100 μm cell strainer.\nCentrifuge at 200 × g for 3 min and aspirate the supernatant leaving ∼3 mL of liquid.\nAlloxan treatment (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F and 1G):\nPrepare 1M stock solution in DDW.\nCritical: alloxan is unstable in solution, alloxan stock solution must be prepared fresh immediately before use.\nDilute alloxan stock solution 1:100 (10 mM) in desired volume of HBSS wash solution.\nFor each pancreas: prepare 3 × 15 mL conical tubes each containing 9 mL of HBSS+alloxan (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E, left panel).\nResuspend the cell pellet in 3 mL HBSS wash solution and transfer gently 1 mL to each of the 15 mL conical tubes containing the alloxan solution.\nIncubate for 10 min at room temperature (20°–30°C) and allow cell clusters to sediment by gravity (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E, right panel). This helps to deplete dead cells and enrich for large cell clusters.\nOptional: alloxan treatment depletes native β cells from the culture. This step is critical when studying reprogramming of exocrine to endocrine cells. However, as native β cells comprise a small fraction of the cells in the culture, their presence will not interfere with most other application of this protocol. Hence, if this protocol is to be used for other application than reprogramming, use HBSS wash solution without alloxan in this step.",
    "Aspirate alloxan solution leaving ∼1 mL at the bottom of the tube. Resuspend the cell pellet with trimmed 1 mL pipette tip and from each tube transfer to a new 15 mL tube containing 9 mL of HBSS wash solution (3 tubes per pancreas, Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E, left panel). Allow cell clusters to sediment by gravity to the bottom of the tube for 7 min.\nRepeat the last step but this time combine three tubes containing cells from the same pancreas into one 15 mL tube.\nFrom this stage, all subsequent steps should be performed in the tissue culture hood. Aspirate the HBSS wash solution from the 15 mL conical tube leaving a minimal volume at the bottom.\nResuspend the cells gently using a trimmed 1 mL pipette tip and resuspend in 3 mL of Waymouth’s culture medium in a 50 mL conical tube.\nPlating of cells: for reproducibility, in every experiment the ratio of virus titer to the number of cells should remain constant. Since cells are clustered, it is impractical to count them. As an alternative protein content is measured and 850 μg protein from cells is plated per well in a 6-well plate:\nMix cells gently by swirling the conical tube and immediately transfer 100 μL of cells to an Eppendorf tube.\nWash the cells twice with PBS by centrifugation of the cells at 500 × g for 4 min.\nLyse the cells using 100 μL of lysis buffer.\nMeasure protein concentration using Bio-Rad protein assay.\nCalculate the protein concentration in the original tube containing cells.\nDilute the cells to a final concentration of 1,700 μg protein equivalent /mL with Waymouth’s medium.\nAdd 1.5 mL of Waymouth’s medium to the desired amount of wells in 6-well plates (non-collagen coated at this stage).",
    "To each well add 0.5 mL of cell suspension.\nCritical: exocrine cell clusters sink very fast. While plating, it is important to continually and gently swirl the tube containing the cells in order to uniformly mix them. Otherwise, a non- uniform number of clusters will be plated in each well.\nTransfer the plates to a standard tissue culture incubator (37°C, 5% CO2) while preparing the adenoviruses for infection.\nAdenoviral Infections\nTiming: 20 min\nIn this section, exocrine cell clusters isolated in the previous section are infected with adenoviral vectors that induce reprogramming to the endocrine lineages: Ad-PDX1 and Ad-NGN3 induce reprogramming to the somatostatin δ cell lineage. The addition of Ad-MafA to this mix, results in reprogramming to the insulin-expressing β cell lineage. Notice that infection with this virus mix will result in formation of mutually exclusive mono-hormonal cells that express either somatostatin or insulin. Using a single viral vector that expresses all three PNM factors (namely Ad-M3-mCherry) results in formation of predominantly insulin-expressing cells. We provide below the titers we use for infections with each of these viral vectors. However, before initiating use of a new viral vector, it is important to calibrate the desired titer for infection, as different vectors achieve maximal expression at different titers and some vectors compromise cell viability at high titers. See the “Expected Outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]” section for further details on titer calibration.\nFor each well, prepare a mix that contains the desired volume of virus stocks in 50 μL Waymouth’s medium per well. See Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1], an example of preparation of virus mix. We use the following final titers (in the 6-well plate containing cells in 2 mL medium):\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_174_9.csv\nAd-rPDX1 10 × 106 IFU/mL (Sapir et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11])\nAd-hNGN3 20 × 106 IFU/mL (Gasa et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4])",
    "Ad-MafA 2.5 × 106 IFU/mL (Berneman-Zeitouni et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2])\nAd-M3-mCherry 20 × 106 IFU/mL (Addgene: pAD-M3cherry, plasmid #61041); (Li et al., 2014a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8])\nNote: To study reprogramming to the δ-cell lineage (somatostatin-expressing cells), we use infection with Ad-hNGN3 alone or together with Ad-rPDX1 (to increase efficiency (Elhanani et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3])). To study reprogramming to the β cell lineage (insulin-expressing cells), we use a mix of Ad-rPDX1, Ad-hNGN3 and Ad-mMafA, or a single adenoviral vector encoding all three PNM factors: Ad-M3-mCherry.\nCritical: The titer used for each virus should be calibrated separately. See the “Expected Outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]” section for further details.\nVortex the virus mix well.\nRemove the plate containing the cells from the incubator and add 50 μL of the virus mix to each well. Mix well by swirling the plate gently.\nPut the plate back into the incubator.\nCritical: Exocrine cell clusters tend to clump in the middle of the culture plate. To avoid this, open the incubator door, and just before placing the plate inside, swirl it once more in order to evenly distribute the cells in the plate.\nIncubate the cells for 16–24 h.\nPlating the Cells\nTiming: 1 h\nOn the next day, collect the cell suspension from each well (using 1 mL trimmed pipette tip) into a 15 mL tube. Cell suspensions from the same experimental group can be collected to a single tube.\nAllow the cells to sediment by gravity for 8 min to deplete dead cells and aspirate maximum amount of media leaving the cell pellet at the bottom.",
    "To wash away the virus, for each experimental group, prepare a new 15 mL tube containing 9 mL of Waymouth’s medium. Collect the cell pellet using 1 mL trimmed pipette tip and gently add the cell suspension to the top layer of media in the new tube.\nAllow the cells to sediment by gravity for 8 min to deplete dead cells and aspirate maximum amount of media leaving the cell pellet at the bottom.\nResuspend the cell pellet in Waymouth’s medium in the desired volume for plating. For volumes larger than 3 mL, we recommend using 50 mL conical tubes to allow proper mixing of the cells by swirling prior to plating.\nCritical: Do not mix the cells by pipetting them up and down, this can seriously damage the integrity and viability of exocrine cell clusters.\nPlate the cells on collagen-coated plates according to the desired subsequent application:\nFor RNA extraction: plate the cells on 6-well or 24-well plates. Cells from each infected well (from the original 6-well plate), can be plated on four wells of 24-well plate.\nFor immunofluorescence: plate on 24-well plates, or on 4-well μ slides (ibidi) or on wells containing collagen-coated plastic coverslips. Do not use glass coverslips as cells do not attach well to them.\nFor insulin secretion assay: plate cells on 12-well plates. Cells from each infected well (from the original 6-well plate) should be plated on two wells of 12-well plates\nFor application that require large numbers of cells such as flow cytometry or ChIP, plate cells on 10 cm culture dishes. All cells from a 6-well plate (from the original 6-well plate) should be plated on one 10 cm culture dish.",
    "Critical: exocrine cell clusters sink very quickly and this may result in an uneven distribution of the number of cells between wells. To avoid this, during plating, the tube containing the cells should be continuously mixed by gentle swirling.\nOptional: exocrine cell clusters can also be grown in suspension. If cells are plated on non-collagen-coated plates most will remain in suspension. In our hands, this did not affect reprogramming efficiency.\nTransfer the plates to a standard tissue culture incubator (37°C, 5% CO2).\nAfter 48 h change the medium: most cell clusters will attach to the plate. Aspirate the old medium containing dead cells and unattached cell clusters and add fresh medium.\nMedium should be changed every other day.\nEndocrine gene expression is already detected 3 days post cell isolation. Insulin-positive cells will begin to appear 5 days after cell isolation. Cells can be cultured for up to 8 days, after which they lose viability.\nAssessing Reprogramming: Endocrine Gene Expression Analysis\nTiming: 4 h\nTo analyze efficiency of the reprogramming protocol, endocrine gene expression can be measured by qPCR. Endocrine gene activation is detected 3 days following isolation of the cells. For control, wells infected with a mock adenovirus such Ad-mCherry (Li et al., 2014a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) or Ad-LacZ (Berneman-Zeitouni et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) are used.\nTo analyze gene expression, cells are harvested with Tri-reagent at the desired time point and RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis is performed using standard protocols.",
    "Critical: isolation of intact RNA from exocrine cells is often challenging due to high expression of digestive enzymes. Cultured exocrine cells lose enzyme gene expression with time in culture (Rooman et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). Therefore, RNA extracted after 3 days in culture will typically be intact. If analysis of RNA at earlier time points is required, RNA integrity should be thoroughly assessed by gel or tape-station.\nPerform qRT-PCR with desired primers for endocrine genes.\nAssessing Reprogramming: Hormone Production\nTiming: 4 h\nHormone production is analyzed by immunofluorescent staining of insulin and somatostatin. Hormones will be detected 5 days following exocrine cell isolation.\nAspirate the medium and fix cells for 12 min in 4% PFA\nPerform three washes of the cells with PBST (PBS supplemented with 0.2% Triton X-100). In the third wash, leave the cells in PBST for 15 min before continuing with the protocol. All subsequent washes are performed in PBST.\nFor blocking, incubate the cells for 1 h with CAS-Block.\nOptional: supplement CAS-Block with 5% horse serum during blocking.\nDilute primary antibodies in CAS-Block: guinea pig anti-insulin (DAKO, A0564, 1:300) and goat anti-somatostatin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-7819, 1:200).\nIncubate with primary antibodies for 1–3 h at room temperature (20–30°C) or overnight (16–20 h) at 4°C.\nWash the cells three times with PBST\nIncubate with secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted 1:200 in CAS-Block for 1 h at room temperature (20–30°C).\nWash the cells three times with PBST\nStain nuclei for 10 min using 1 μg/mL DAPI in DDW.\nWash DAPI with PBS.\nIf using 24-well plates or ibidi 4-well μ slides, cells can be directly imaged. Alternatively, if using plastic coverslips, mount on slides before imaging.\nFlow Cytometry\nTiming: 1 day",
    "Analysis of gene expression and hormone production as described in the previous sections can also be performed by Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) or analyzer. To analyze gene expression of PNM- expressing cells, Ad-M3-mCherry-infected cells, are sorted based on mCherry signal. By using exocrine cell clusters isolated from MIP-GFP mice (mouse insulin promoter-GFP, (Hara et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7])), a population enriched for reprogrammed cells can be obtained based on GFP expression, as we previously described (Figures 2A, S2B, and S2E in Elhanani et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). To analyze hormone production by flow cytometry, cells are dissociated, fixed and internally stained for hormone expression.\nAspirate culture medium following desired time of culture.\nWash the cells once with PBS.\nTreat cells with 0.025% trypsin (Biological Industries, 03-054-1B, diluted 1:2 in PBS) for 12 min in 37°C.\nFollowing incubation, dissociate the cells by pipetting up and down 10–15 times using 1 mL pipette tip.\nTransfer the cell suspension to Eppendorf tubes containing 100 μL FBS (for quenching of trypsin).\nCentrifuge the cells for 5 min at 500 × g and wash twice with FACS buffer (PBS, 2 mM EDTA, 2.5% FBS).\nCentrifuge again for 5 min at 500 × g and aspirate FACS buffer.\nResuspend the cell pellet in fixable viability dye eFluor450 diluted 1:1,000 in FACS buffer to label dead cells.\nCritical: The expected cell viability is 50%–75%. As a result, staining for dead cells is necessary to obtain reliable flow cytometry results. This step cannot be omitted from the protocol.\nIncubate for 30 min on ice.\nWash the cells once by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min and resuspend in FACS buffer.\nIf cell-sorting is required for gene expression analysis:\nPass the cell suspension through a 35 μm cell strainer to deplete cell clumps.",
    "At this stage cells are taken to the FACS instrument. Gate the living cells based on fixable viability dye eFluor450 stain (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nSort desired populations of cells directly into lysis buffer supplemented with RNA- extraction kit. We recommend the RNeasy micro kit.\nProceed with RNA extraction and follow standard protocols for qPCR or library preparation for RNA-sequencing.\nIf analysis of hormone production with intracellular stain is required:\nFix the cells in 4% PFA in PBS for 10 min.\nCentrifuge at 600 × g for 5 min and resuspend cell pellet in PBST.\nFollow the protocol for immune-staining in the previous section with 600 × g, 5 min centrifugations between stages.\nPass the cell suspension through a 35 μm cell strainer to deplete cell clumps.\nTake the cells to the flow cytometer, gate the living cells based on the fixable viability dye eFluor450 stain (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D) and analyze the data.\nAssessing Reprogramming: Insulin Secretion\nTiming: 4 days\nTo measure insulin secreted by reprogrammed cells (typically ∼3% of the cells in the culture), the cumulative secretion between days 5 to 8 is measured. Since cell culturing for this time frame is required to obtain detectable amounts of insulin, this assay is performed in complete RPMI culture media rather than the standard Krebs Ringer buffer usually used in insulin secretion assays. Cell lysates are also collected to allow measurement of insulin content. This assay is performed on cells plated on 12-well plates.\nAspirate the medium (Waymouth’s) of day 5 cells.\nWash the cells once with RPMI medium (supplemented with 2.5% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution and 25 ng/mL murine EGF, and the desired glucose concentrations) and aspirate.",
    "To each well, add 300 μL of RPMI medium. At this stage, cells in different wells can be exposed to different treatments (i.e., different glucose concentrations, hormone/compound treatments etc.)\nPlace the plates in the incubator for 3 days.\nOn day 8, collect all medium from each well into Eppendorf tubes.\nCentrifuge at maximum speed for 10 min and transfer the supernatant to new Eppendorf tubes or to 96-well plates. Discard the pellets. These samples contain the secreted insulin. Insulin can be measured on the same day, or samples can be kept at −20°C.\nAdd 1 mL of PBS supplemented with 2.5% FBS to each well, harvest the cells using a cell scraper and transfer the cell suspensions into Eppendorf tubes.\nNote: following harvest, exocrine cells do not pellet well after centrifugation. To improve this, we recommend adding 2.5% FBS to the PBS and to specifically use Eppendorf tubes rather than alternate brands (Eppendorf, #0030 120.086).\nCentrifuge cells at 600 × g for 5 min.\nAspirate all supernatant and discard it.\nResuspend the cell pellet using 30 μL lysis buffer.\nMeasure insulin both in the supernatant and cell lysates using Insulin ultra-sensitive kit according to manufacturer’s instructions.\nFor normalization, measure the protein content in the cell lysates using Bio-Rad protein assay.\nCalculate the total amount of secreted insulin, insulin content in cell lysates and protein content in lysates. Normalize secreted and content of insulin to total protein."
