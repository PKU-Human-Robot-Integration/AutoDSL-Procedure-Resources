    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCollect C. elegans embryos to add to cultures\nTiming: ∼1 h\nIn this step embryos will be isolated by hypochlorite treatment (“bleaching”) to obtain a synchronous population at a defined density. Additional bleach protocols are described elsewhere (Lewis and Fleming, 1995[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Porta-de-la-Riva et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; Stiernagle, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nPrepare bleach solution.\nDetermine how much bleach solution will be needed based on the number of strains that will be bleached. It is generally recommended to prepare at least 10 mL of bleach solution for each strain or condition that will be bleached separately.\nPrepare an appropriate amount of bleach solution: 1 part 5 M KOH or NaOH, 2 parts sodium hypochlorite solution (Sigma), and 7 parts ddH2O.\nWash worms from plates or from liquid culture with many well-fed gravid adults.\nWash worms from plates two times using ∼3 mL of S-complete each time per 6 cm plate and aspirate with a 10 mL serological pipet into a 15 mL conical tube. After washing, plates can be observed under a microscope to ensure adequate collection of worms.\nSpin the worms at 3,000 rpm (1,500 × g) in a clinical centrifuge for 1 min and aspirate supernatant.\nAdd 3–4 mL bleach solution to the worms in the 15 mL conical tube. Start a stopwatch. Vortex constantly with periodic shaking of the tube to disrupt the worms.\nAfter 1–2 min, spin the conical tube with worms at 3,000 rpm for 1 min to pellet.\nAspirate the bleach solution and add a fresh 3–4 mL of bleach solution to the tube. Shake and vortex the tube constantly until all worms have dissolved and only embryos are visible in the tube under a microscope. This may take up to 5 min more (7 min total time in bleach, including the centrifugation).",
    "When only embryos are visible, pellet embryos by centrifuging at 3,000 rpm for 1 min. If dauers are present, they will either take longer to dissolve or will not dissolve completely.\nTroubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]\nWash the embryos 3× in 10 mL S-basal by centrifuging and aspirating while being careful to leave the pellet of embryos intact with ∼100 μL of supernatant.\nResuspend the embryos in 10 mL of S-basal.\nDetermine and adjust the concentration of embryos.\nVortex gently for a few seconds to evenly distribute the embryos, and take at least three 10–100 μL samples from the resuspended embryos and count the number of embryos in each sample. Increase sample size, or dilute the sample, so that at least 100–200 embryos in total are counted across all samples taken to ensure accurate determination of density. If necessary, spin the sample down at 3,000 rpm and aspirate the S-basal down to a lower volume to increase the concentration of embryos. Minimize pipetting of the embryos since they may stick to plastic pipettes.\nAdjust the volume of S-basal such that embryos are at a concentration of 1/μL (or another desired concentration).\nTroubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]\nEmbryos can be cultured on a roller drum or in an Erlenmeyer flask in a shaker to hatch (hatching occurs 10–14 h post-bleach) and arrest as L1 larvae (Application I), or they can be added to S-complete with HB101 for growth in rich, dauer-forming, or dietary-restriction conditions.",
    "Critical: Do not leave the worms and embryos in the bleach solution for too long. In most cases, embryos should be washed with S-basal by 10 min at the very most after bleach addition, ideally closer to 7 min. The shells of embryos protect them from the damaging effects of bleach, but they will also be compromised if left in the bleach for too long. As soon as worm carcasses have dissolved S-basal should be added to dilute the bleach solution and prevent damage to the embryos.\nNote: Typically about ten embryos are recovered from each gravid worm bleached. Embryo yield therefore depends on the number of gravid worms per plate used. For example, a 10 cm plate seeded with a chunk from a fresh starved plate with many young larvae yields approximately 5,000 - 10,000 embryos when bleached on the first or second day of egg laying but before starving, and a similar 6 cm plate yields approximately one-third as many embryos. Alternatively, starvation can be avoided by either chunking plates before they starve, resulting in mixed-stage populations with a lower proportion of gravid adults and reduced embryo yield, or by using L4 larvae to seed plates and bleaching on the first or second day of progeny egg laying. For the latter, we typically use seven L4s per 10 cm plate (more could be used, but at this low density they avoid dietary restriction as progeny become gravid), typically yielding 2,000 - 5,000 embryos per plate when bleached after 96 h at 20°C. In summary, the number of gravid worms per plate at the time of bleaching can be estimated as an indication of embryo yield, and it is best to establish consistent culture methods for consistent yields.\nApplication I: starvation and L1 larval arrest",
    "Timing: 15 min setup, 12 h to several weeks culture time\nTo starve worms, suspend embryos obtained from bleach at a concentration of 1/μL in S-basal. Embryos will hatch within approximately 12 h and enter L1 arrest (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/409-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Representative images of C. elegans arrested as L1 larvae and dauer larvae resulting from liquid-culture growth in Applications I and III\n(A) Starved L1 larvae.\n(B) Dauer larvae. Scale bars, 50 μm.\nIncubate cultures in glass test tubes on a roller drum or in Erlenmeyer flasks at 20°C with shaking at 180 rpm. We recommend using a volume of 5 mL (5,000 total embryos) in a 16 mm tube, 10 mL (10,000 embryos) in a 25 mm tube, or 2 mL (2,000 embryos) in a 10 mm tube. For Erlenmeyer flasks, we recommend a volume equal to 10%–20% of the stated volume of the flask.\nCritical: Concentrations of worms other than 1/μL may be used; however, the density of larvae impacts starvation survival so consistency is essential (Artyukhin et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nNote: As far as we know, S-basal without cholesterol or ethanol (virgin) is comparable to M9. S-basal can be used with or without cholesterol and ethanol, but the presence of ethanol approximately doubles the duration of starvation survival while maintaining developmental arrest (Castro et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nApplication II: Large-scale liquid culture in rich conditions\nTiming: 15 min setup\nLiquid cultures can be used to grow large quantities of synchronized worms.",
    "A large-scale liquid culture can be established by diluting stock bacterial food to 50 mg/mL (2×) in S-complete and adding up to 5 embryos per μL (dauer formation occurs at higher densities). Worms can also be cultured at 1 per μL in 1× HB101. The culture is synchronized by starting with embryos, and tighter synchrony can be achieved by instead starting with larvae on the first day of L1 arrest (see Application I[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2]) (Baugh, 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nIncubate cultures at 20°C with shaking at 180 rpm for desired amount of time. For example, starting with embryos from bleach, cultures will be fully gravid after 72 h, and starting with arrested L1 larvae the first eggs are evident at 53 h and the cultures are fully gravid after 60 h. The worm and bacteria densities provided in step 3 are sufficient for the cultures to become fully gravid without starvation. We typically do not allow the cultures to continue after becoming fully gravid since C. elegans hold their eggs in liquid ( Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/409-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Scale bars, 200 μm.\nWorms may be collected from liquid cultures by centrifugation in a clinical centrifuge (3,000 rpm or 1,500 × g for 1 min) in 15, 50, or 250 mL conical tubes. Large populations of worms also may be bleached for collection of large numbers of embryos to scale-up for different applications.\nTroubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]\nTroubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]\nTroubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]",
    "Optional: Instead of starting liquid cultures with embryos collected from bleach treatment, it is also possible to wash worms from nematode growth media (NGM) plates and add them to liquid cultures. For example, a starved 6 cm plate can be used to start a 25 mL culture with 50 mg/mL (2×) HB101, producing a gravid population in 2–3 days. Also, if cultures begin to deplete the bacteria initially provided, additional bacteria can simply be added over time until the point of harvest (exchanging the buffer is not necessary), as long as bacterial density does not exceed 50 mg/mL (2×), but it is best to avoid this scenario.\nNote: HB101 has no detectable proliferation in S-complete based on optical density, but bacterial density does decrease over time in these batch cultures due to consumption, potentially exposing worms to dietary restriction before collection (Hibshman et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Worm density can be reduced to avoid this. If the density of worms in culture is too high, dauer larvae may begin to form even with high bacterial density. It is important to monitor cultures to ensure that worms are not entering the dauer state.\nApplication III: Dauer formation cultures\nTiming: 15 min setup, 1 week to 1–2 months culture time\nTo establish a liquid culture that will cause worms to enter dauer diapause, suspend embryos following bleach or arrested L1 larvae at a density of 5/μL in S-complete and add bacterial HB101 food stock to 1 mg/mL.",
    "Incubate the culture in an Erlenmeyer flask at 20°C with shaking at 180 rpm. We recommend using a 25 mL flask with a 5 mL volume of liquid culture, or a larger volume in larger flasks without exceeding 10%–20% of the flask's volume. We have not used glass test tubes in this application, but we presume they work as well.\nLarvae develop slowly and enter dauer diapause by day 4 or 5 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). Dauers can be maintained for at least 40 days in culture while maintaining viability and the ability to recover.\nDauers can be recovered on NGM plates or in a new liquid culture (after brief washing) with reduced density and high food availability (see rich conditions described in Application II[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3]).\nCritical: The density and food concentration are critical for ensuring the vast majority of worms enter dauer diapause. Increasing food concentration or lowering worm population density will increase the frequency of worms that do not enter dauer diapause.\nNote: There are several ways of identifying dauers as well as alternative protocols for dauer formation (Karp, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Nika et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). Strengths of this protocol include that it works with wild-type worms, dauer pheromone is not necessary, SDS or other selection is not necessary, dauer formation is relatively synchronous, and culture parameters are reproducible.\nApplication IV: Dietary restriction\nTiming: 15 min setup, 12 h to 4 days culture time",
    "To set up conditions for dietary restriction, any dilution of food may be established to create the desired level of dietary restriction. We recommend assaying the phenotype of interest over a range of bacterial densities for optimization. We suggest using 25 mg/mL (1×) HB101 as a baseline well-fed ( ad libitum) control. Based on maximum embryo size, we found 3.1 mg/mL HB101 (an 8-fold dilution of the 1×, 25 mg/mL, ad libitum concentration) to be optimal for dietary restriction (Hibshman et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Embryos or L1 larvae should be added to a concentration of 1/100 μL such that bacterial density is not significantly depleted as worms develop, approximating a chemostat rather than a typical batch culture ( Hibshman et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Low worm density makes it more challenging to obtain extremely large populations in this application compared to the others, but if this is limiting then density can be raised as long as there is no detectable effect on measured bacterial density over time during incubation.\nIncubate cultures in Erlenmeyer flasks at 20°C with shaking at 180 rpm.\nWorms can be collected for analysis at any point during their life cycle, or at 96 h for bleaching to collect their progeny (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2])."
