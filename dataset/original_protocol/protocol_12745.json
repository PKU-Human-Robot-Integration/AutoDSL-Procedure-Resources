    "All animal procedures were conducted with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Southern California and the Van Andel Research Institute and in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals from the National Institutes of Health15.\n1. Modify the gene of interest for repression by REMOTE-control\nUsing the guidelines below, identify a transcriptionally inert intron toward the 5’ end of the gene of interest for insertion of the Repron sequence (\"Repression intron\"; 12 symmetric lac operators plus a partial rabbit beta-globin intron). Be aware of alternative promoters for the gene of interest, and choose an intron according to the transcript(s) to be controlled (i.e. an intron shared by all transcripts or one specific to a desired transcript).\n\tNOTE: For genes without an intron or with ones toward the 3’ end, insert the Repron sequence into the promoter (see Lee, et al.10 for a detailed procedure).\n\t\nObtain the genomic sequence for the gene of interest.\n\t\t\nNavigate to the UCSC Genome Browser16,17, and select the latest draft of the mouse genome (Mouse GRCm38/mm10 at time of publication), which is currently under the Genomes tab.\nEnter the name or symbol of the gene of interest into the search bar to view the transcripts for the gene. Click go.\nSelect the desired transcript variant for the gene of interest.\nClick on the gene symbol next to the transcript variant of interest (the symbol of the previously selected transcript will be in a dark box).\nUnder the Sequence and Links to Tools and Databases banner, click the Genomic Sequence link.",
    "For Sequence Retrieval Region Options, select only Exons (5’ UTR, CDS, and 3’ UTR), Introns, and the default One FASTA record per gene. For Sequence Formatting Options, select Exons in upper case, everything else in lower case and Mask Repeats to N (to conceal repetitive sequences). Then click submit.\nSave this sequence, preserving the upper- and lowercase formatting, in a document or program that can be annotated.\nAvoid interruption of CpG islands, which may indicate regions with gene regulatory function.\n\t\tNOTE: Though a 5’ intron is preferable for insertion of the Repron sequence, the first intron may contain transcriptional regulatory elements such as CpG islands (examined in this step) or enhancer elements (examined in step 1.1.4), which are to be avoided for Repron insertion.\n\t\t\nUnder the Expression and Regulation banner of the UCSC Genome Browser, select show for the CpG Islands track, and click refresh.\nZooming in on the 5’ introns, click on each CpG island (shown in green at the time of publication if present), and select View DNA for this feature.\nAfter selecting Mask repeats to N, select get DNA to obtain the CpG island sequence.\nOverlay these sequences with the original sequence file, and annotate these as intronic regions to avoid due to possible gene regulatory functions.\nAvoid interruption of non-coding RNAs, in case they have a regulatory function.\n\t\t\nUnder the Genes and Gene Predictions banner of the UCSC Genome Browser, select show for the GENCODE (Ensembl) track, and click refresh.\nZooming in on the 5’ introns, click on each non-coding RNA (shown in green at the time of publication if present), and obtain the DNA sequence for each by clicking on its chromosomal coordinates.\nIn the View dropdown menu, select DNA, and click Mask repeats to N. Then click get DNA.",
    "Overlay these sequences with the original sequence file, and annotate these as intronic regions to avoid due to possible gene regulatory functions.\nAvoid intronic regions with enhancer signatures in the tissue(s) of interest, such as H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and DNase I hypersensitivity18,19,20,21, as well as CTCF binding sites, which regulate enhancer looping22,23.\n\t\t\nNavigate to the ENCODE database24,25, and select the Experiments icon.\nFor the assay type, select ChIP-seq or DNase-seq, and populate the other categories (Organism, Biosample type, etc.) according to the cells to be engineered.\nAfter feature selection, hover over the pictograms in blue, and select the one for which View Results as List appears (left-most pictogram at time of publication).\nSelect the datasets for the targets of H3K4me1, H3K27ac, DNase I, and CTCF that most closely match the cells to be engineered.\nWithin each relevant dataset, scroll to the Files section, verify that mm10 (or the latest genome version) and UCSC are selected, and click the Visualize button.\nNow in the UCSC Genome Browser and zooming in on the 5’ introns for the gene of interest, click on each H3K4me1, H3K27ac, DNase I, and CTCF peak in their respective annotated peak tracks.\nObtain the DNA sequence for each peak region by clicking on its chromosomal coordinates.\nIn the View dropdown menu, select DNA, and click Mask repeats to N. Then click get DNA.\nOverlay these sequences with the original sequence file, and annotate these as intronic regions to avoid due to possible gene regulatory functions.\nAvoid disruption of consensus splicing sequences, so as not to interfere with appropriate splicing of the exons.",
    "NOTE: Although sequences required for splicing are largely confined to about six bases at the 5' end of an intron26 and about 60 bases at the 3' end27, it is advisable to select a large intron, allowing for considerably wider margins from these consensus regions to minimize the likelihood of impacting splicing. Use of intron analysis tools, such as SVM-BPfinder28, is recommended for a more thorough analysis of potential splice sequences.\nAfter identifying an intronic region that meets the above criteria (as exemplified for Dnmt1 in the supplementary data), screen the sequence using an online sgRNA design tool to identify an sgRNA in the region with high specificity and predicted efficiency scores.\n\t\nNavigate to an online sgRNA design tool of choice, such as CRISPOR29.\nEnter the sequence of the intronic region of interest, specify the relevant reference genome, and select the desired Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM). Click Submit.\nSort the predicted sgRNAs by specificity score, and select one or more sgRNAs that also have a high predicted efficiency score29.\n\t\t\nOptional: To maximize the likelihood of using an effective sgRNA, first test the cleavage efficiency of several top-scoring sgRNAs in an in vitro assay30, and proceed with the most efficient sgRNA in vivo.\nDesign a DNA template containing a PITT (Pronuclear Injection-based Targeted Transgenesis) landing pad sequence, as exemplified in Supplementary Figure 1A,B, flanked on both sides by 60-base homology arms that correspond to the sgRNA cut site31.\n\tNOTE: The landing pad contains two heterotypic loxP sites (JT15 and Lox2272) and enables targeted insertion of large sequences through a two-step approach; be sure that the junctions of this insertion do not create cryptic splice sites. Alternatively, an embryonic stem cell (ESC)-based knock-in strategy can be used to insert the Repron sequence directly.",
    "Prepare the sgRNA, Cas9 protein, and the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) template for the landing pad, and microinject into fertilized eggs (from B6C3F1/J mice or other desired strain) according to established protocols32,33.\nScreen for mice with the landing pad knock-in.\n\t\nDesign PCR primers complementary to the genomic locus but outside of the regions targeted by the homology arms, as demonstrated for Dnmt1 in Supplementary Figure 1C. Avoid repetitive genomic sequences when designing the primers.\nExtract DNA from tail clips of the mice according to established protocols34.\nUse PCR and gel electrophoresis to identify mice with a landing pad insertion.\nConfirm that the knock-in was successful by sequencing the PCR products.\n\t\tNOTE: Unwanted large deletions and rearrangements can be introduced by CRISPR/Cas935, so careful screening for off-target editing is advised before proceeding35,36,37.\nUsing fertilized eggs from the landing pad mice, microinject iCre mRNA38 and a transgenic plasmid containing the Repron sequence flanked by JTZ17 and Lox2272 recombination sites31,39,40,41 according to established methods38,42,43.\nScreen for mice with the Repron insertion.\n\t\nDesign PCR primers complementary to the genomic locus, outside of the Repron insert. Avoid repetitive genomic sequences when designing the primers.\nExtract DNA from tail clips of the mice according to established protocols34.\nUse PCR and gel electrophoresis to identify mice with a Repron insertion.\nConfirm the knock-in was successful by sequencing the PCR products.\n2. Modify the gene of interest for upregulation by REMOTE-control\nUsing the guidelines below, identify a region in the promoter of the gene of interest that is unlikely to perturb promoter function upon insertion of tet operator sequences. Be aware of alternative promoters for the gene of interest, and choose a promoter according to the transcript(s) to be controlled (i.e. a promoter shared by all transcripts or one specific to a desired transcript).",
    "Obtain the genomic sequence for the promoter of interest.\n\t\t\nNavigate to the UCSC Genome Browser16,17, and select the latest draft of the mouse genome (Mouse GRCm38/mm10 at time of publication), which is currently under the Genomes tab.\nEnter the name or symbol of the gene of interest into the search bar to view the transcripts for the gene. Click go.\nSelect the desired transcript variant for the gene of interest.\nClick on the gene symbol next to the transcript variant of interest (the gene symbol of the previously selected transcript will be in a dark box).\nUnder the Sequence and Links to Tools and Databases banner, click the Genomic Sequence link.\nFor Sequence Retrieval Region Options, select only Promoter/Upstream by 1000 bases. For Sequence Formatting Options, select Mask Repeats to N (to conceal repetitive sequences). Then click submit.\nSave this promoter sequence in a document or program that can be annotated.\nSelect regions that are free of putative transcription factor binding sites, as interrupting these sequences may alter endogenous gene expression.\n\t\t\nNavigate to the UCSC Genome Browser, and open the latest version of the mouse genome.\nAbove the Mapping and Sequencing banner, select track hubs.\nClick mm10 next to the hub name of JASPAR 2018 TFBS (or the latest JASPAR version).\nEnter the name or symbol of the gene of interest into the search bar to view the transcripts for the gene. Click go.\nSelect the desired transcript variant for the gene of interest.\nScroll down to the JASPAR 2018 TFBS banner, and click the dropdown arrow to select the desired viewing option for the track, such as squish. Click refresh.",
    "Zoom into the promoter region of the gene of interest, and identify regions that are free (or relatively free) of transcription factor binding sites according to the JASPAR track. Record the chromosomal coordinates of these regions.\nObtain the genomic sequence of these chromosomal coordinates by typing them into the search bar and clicking go. In the View dropdown menu, select DNA, and click Mask repeats to N. Then click get DNA.\nOverlay these sequences with the original sequence file, and annotate these as ideal promoter regions to target due to lack of transcription factor binding.\nWithin these sequences, select a perturbable promoter region that is upstream but near the transcription start site of the gene of interest.\n\t\tNOTE: An insertion that is too close to the transcription start site may increase the chance of impairing promoter activity, but an insertion that is too far may decrease the level of upregulation. Inserting tet operator sequences about 200 basepairs upstream of the transcription start site has resulted in robust upregulation of the two promoters tested (see discussion)10.\nScreen the selected promoter region using an online sgRNA design tool to identify an sgRNA in the region with high specificity and predicted efficiency scores.\n\t\nNavigate to an online sgRNA design tool of choice, such as CRISPOR29.\nEnter the sequence of the region of interest, specify the relevant reference genome, and select the desired Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM). Click Submit.\nSort the predicted sgRNAs by specificity score, and select one or more sgRNAs that also have a high predicted efficiency score29.\n\t\t\nOptional: To maximize the likelihood of using an effective sgRNA, first test the cleavage efficiency of several sgRNAs in an in vitro assay30, and proceed with the most efficient sgRNA in vivo.",
    "Design a DNA template containing tet operators flanked on both sides by 60-base homology arms that correspond to the sgRNA cut site31,33.\n\tNOTE: The number of tet operators is customizable; insertion of two to four tet operator sequences in tandem has previously been shown to be effective, but in principle more operators are desirable for driving higher expression. Alternatively, an ESC-based knock-in strategy can be used to insert the tet operators.\n\t\nOptional: For experimental evidence that the proposed modifications will likely not disrupt the endogenous transcriptional activity of the gene of interest, clone the engineered promoter sequence into a firefly luciferase vector (such as pGL3-Basic), and compare its efficacy to the original promoter using a luciferase assay.\nPrepare the sgRNA, Cas9 protein, and the ssDNA template containing the tet operator sequences, and microinject into fertilized eggs (from B6C3F1/J mice or other desired strain) according to established protocols32,33.\n\tNOTE: Due to the complexity of synthesizing a repetitive sequence, an in vitro transcription/reverse transcription-based approach is recommended to synthesize a ssDNA template from a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) plasmid44. Alternatively, a dsDNA template may be used for microinjection, but the knock-in efficiency may be reduced45.\nScreen for mice with knock-in of the tet operators.\n\t\nDesign PCR primers complementary to the genomic locus, outside of the regions targeted by the homology arms. Avoid repetitive genomic sequences when designing the primers.\nExtract DNA from tail clips of the mice according to established protocols34.\nUse PCR and gel electrophoresis to identify mice with the insertion of the tet operators.\nConfirm that the knock-in was successful by sequencing the PCR products.\n\t\tNOTE: Unwanted large deletions and rearrangements can be introduced by CRISPR/Cas935, so careful screening for off-target editing is advised before proceeding35,36,37.\n3. Develop activator- and/or repressor-expressing mice",
    "Identify a robustly expressing promoter for the tissue(s) or cell type(s) of interest.\n\tNOTE: A literature search and the Tissue-Specific Promoter Database46 may be useful for identifying such a promoter.\nPlace the provided enhanced lac repressor or tet activator sequence downstream of the desired promoter to generate a transgenic construct.\nProduce the transgenic mouse line(s) using standard transgenic procedures42,43,47. Alternatively, a site-specific transgenesis approach can be used to avoid position effects and to allow single-copy transgene insertion31,48.\nPropagate the founders, and determine the expression pattern and level of the transgene in the offspring of each founder. Select lines with robust expression in the intended tissue type(s) for further breeding.\n\t\nBreed the founders to wildtype mice.\nDesign PCR primers that will detect the insertion of the activator and/or repressor.\nExtract DNA from tail clips of the offspring according to established protocols34.\nUse PCR and gel electrophoresis to identify mice with the insertion.\nConfirm the transgene insertion by sequencing of the PCR products.\nPropogate the transgenic lines.\nSacrifice a few pups from each line, and collect the tissues of interest for qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and/or western blotting to analyze the expression of the gene/protein of interest in the target tissue type(s).\nSelect the lines with the strongest expression in the tissues of interest for use in section 4.\n4. Manipulate gene expression in vivo\nBreed the mice with the modified gene of interest (section 1 and/or 2) with the transgenic mice from section 3 according to established breeding practices49. For maximal expression control, breed the mice to homozygosity for the modified allele.\nFor reversion or adjustment of repression of the target gene, administer IPTG in the drinking water.",
    "To experimentally determine the dose of IPTG to use, treat mice of the appropriate genotype and controls with one of a range of doses (recommended starting range: 0 – 400 mM IPTG) for at least one week50,51. Include at least three mice per treatment group, and select the age and sex of mice that are most relevant to the planned future experiments. NOTE: Breeding pairs of mice can be treated with IPTG water to provide developmental exposure of IPTG to the offspring if desired13, or mice can begin treatment any time after birth.\n\t\t\nDissolve the desired mass of IPTG in sterile distilled water on the day of administration, and stir with a stir bar for 5 minutes or until fully dissolved.\nWrap the bottle with foil, and administer the IPTG water in a light-protected bottle. Replace twice a week. Provide the same source of water to mice receiving 0 mM IPTG.\nAfter at least one week, sacrifice the mice, and analyze the expression of the gene of interest in the target tissue(s) using qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and/or western blotting.\nIdentify the dose that restores the expression of the gene of interest to that of wildtype controls, and use this dose to achieve normal expression of the gene in future experiments.\nFor induction of gene upregulation, administer Doxycycline (Dox) in the diet.\n\t\nTo experimentally determine the concentration of Dox to administer, treat mice of the appropriate genotype and controls with one of a range of Dox concentrations (recommended starting range: 0 – 5000 mg/kg Doxycycline Hyclate) for at least one week52,53, including at least three mice per treatment group. Purchase Dox-containing mouse food from a commercial vendor.",
    "NOTE: Breeding pairs of mice can be treated with Dox food to provide developmental exposure of Dox to the offspring if desired54,55, or mice can begin treatment any time after birth.\nReplace the diet once per week. Provide the same base diet to mice receiving Dox-free food.\nAfter at least one week, sacrifice the mice, and analyze the expression of the gene of interest in the target tissue(s) using qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and/or western blotting.\nIdentify the dose that elevates the expression of the gene of interest to the desired level, and use this dose to achieve overexpression of the gene in future experiments."
