    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMouse perfusion\nTiming: ∼30 min per mouse\nPerfusion allows the PFA to pass through the circulatory system to fix MuSCs in situ.\nPrepare 30 mL of 1× PBS, 30 mL of 0.5% PFA, and 30 mL of 2 M Glycine in 50 mL falcon tubes with labels for each mouse and place them on ice.\nSet up the perfusion pump at 70 rpm (∼5 mL/min) and the dissection stage.\nAnesthetize the mouse with 20 mg/mL sodium pentobarbital via intraperitoneal injection.\nNote: Suggested dosage for mice anesthetization\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3161_9.csv\nNote: Pinch the mouse by the toe to check whether it is fully anesthetized. Provide an extra dose of anesthetization reagent if needed.\nAfter the mouse is anesthetized, lay the mouse on the dissection stage in the supine position and immobilize with surgical tape/needles. Open the chest and expose the heart for perfusion.\nOpen the pump to drain the air from the needle with 1× PBS and stop. Cut on the right atrium for fluid removal. Pierce the heart in the left ventricle with the butterfly needle.

Graphical illustration of the fluid direction in the heart during perfusion\nPerfuse the mouse with cold 1× PBS for 5 min, then 0.5% PFA for 5 min, and finally with 2 M Glycine for 5 min to quench formaldehyde.\nNote: Pause the pump during solution change. Prevent air from entering the circulatory system.\nFACS preparation and cell sorting\nTiming: Muscle dissociation: ∼4 h; FACS sorting: ∼1 h per mouse\nThe detailed protocol for the preparation of single-cell suspension from unfixed tissue was previously published by Liu et al., 2015. We doubled the collagenase II amount in dissociation buffer for fixed tissue.",
    "Prepare a 10 cm glass Petri dish with 10 mL cold wash medium for each mouse.\nDissect the hindlimb muscles and place them into the Petri dish with wash medium.\nTransfer the muscle to the lid of the Petri dish and mince the muscles into fine pieces (∼1 mm3) in 10 mL dissociation buffer.\nTransfer the minced muscle pieces with dissociation buffer to a 50 mL falcon tube.\nSeal the tube with Parafilm and incubate in a 37°C shaking water bath for 90 min at 65 rpm.\nTop up the tube to 50 mL with fresh cold wash medium.\nCentrifuge the tissue suspension at 500 g for 10 min at 4°C. Aspirate the supernatant until only 20 mL remains in the tube.\nAdd 1 mL of stock Collagenase II solution and 1 mL of stock Dispase solution to the tube and resuspend the pellet.\nSeal the tube with Parafilm and incubate in a 37°C shaking water bath for 30 min at 65 rpm.\nAfter digestion, use a 20 mL syringe and a 20-gauge needle to aspirate and eject the muscle suspension 10 times.\nNote: Remove the undigested pieces that may clog the needle. Eject the muscle suspension towards the wall of the tube to avoid foaming.\nPlace a 40 μm nylon cell strainer onto a new 50 mL falcon tube. Transfer the cell suspension to the new 50 mL falcon tube through the cell strainer.\nAdd 20 mL of cold wash medium to the original tube. Swirl to rinse and transfer it through the same cell strainer.\nTop up the tube to 50 mL with fresh cold wash medium.\nCentrifuge the tube at 500 g for 10 min at 4°C. Remove all of the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet.",
    "Resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of wash medium. Transfer the cell suspension to a fresh 5 mL FACS tube through the filter cap.\nRinse the 50 mL falcon tube with 500 μL cold wash medium and transfer it to the FACS tube through the filter cap.\nSet up the cell sorter following the manufacturer’s specifications with a 70 μm nozzle.\nNote: Place the cell suspension on ice while waiting.\nCollect the singlet YFP+ population at room temperature (25°C) into 1 mL of 1× PBS in a FACS collection tube.\nNote: The sorting plot refers to our previously published STAR Protocol.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]\nCell lysis and de-crosslinking\nTiming: ∼1 day\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 5000 g, 4°C for 10 min.\nAspirate the supernatant carefully. Do not disturb the cell pellet.\nPause point: The cell pellet can be stored at −80°C by snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen.\nAdd 100 μL of RIPA buffer (containing 2% SDS) and mix by pipetting up and down.\nIncubate at 70°C for 2 h to de-crosslink the proteins.\nMeasure the protein concentration using the BCA assay.\nCool the cell lysate on ice. Add 400 μL of pre-cooled acetone to the lysate. Mix by pipetting up and down.\nStore the cell lysate overnight (for 12 h) at −20°C.\nCentrifuge at 15000 g, 4°C for 30 min and discard the supernatant.\nWash protein pellet with 500 μL of pre-cooled (at –20°C) acetone, then 500 μL of 70% pre-cooled ethanol, and finally with 500 μL of pre-cooled acetone. (Centrifuge at 15000 g, 4°C for 5 min after each wash).\nDry the protein pellet using the vacuum concentrator at 25°C for 5 min.\nProtein digestion and de-salting\nTiming: ∼3 h",
    "Sample preparation for bottom-up mass-spectrometry was carried out on the PreOmics system using the iST Sample Preparation Kit, which includes lysis denaturation, reduction, alkylation, Lys-C and trypsin digestion and peptide purification. We altered the lysis temperature to 83°C. Below is a simplified protocol based on the PreON system. The CAPITAL reagents are provided in the iST kit.\nAdd 50 μL of LYSE to 1–100 μg of protein sample, and then place the sample in the HEATING BLOCK (set to 83°C; 1000 rpm; 10 min).\nAdd 210 μL of RESUSPEND to DIGEST (1 tube for 4 reactions), pipette up and down.\nAdd 50 μL of DIGEST to sample tube and rotate at 37°C, 500 rpm for 1 h.\nAdd 100 μL of STOP to sample tube (precipitation may occur), shake at room temperature (25°C), 500 rpm for 1 min.\nTransfer the sample solution mixture to the CARTRIDGE. Spin the CARTRIDGE at 2250 rcf for 1–3 min).\nNote: Adjust the time if needed to ensure complete flow-through.\nAdd 200 μL of WASH 1 to the CARTRIDGE. Spin the CARTRIDGE at 2250 rcf for 1–3 min.\nAdd 200 μL of WASH 2 to the CARTRIDGE.
