    "The following protocol can be applied to various experiments. The information provided details an experiment in which SAI is used to quantify sensorimotor integration during a finger response to a validly or invalidly cued probe. In this protocol, SAI is assessed without a task, then concurrently during the cued sensorimotor task, and then again without a task. The cTMS stimulator can be replaced by any commercially available conventional TMS stimulator. However, the pulse width of the conventional TMS stimulator would be fixed between 70-82 µs depending on the specific hardware59,60. This study was approved by the University of Waterloo's Office of Research Ethics. All participants provided written informed consent.\n1. Hardware/software requirements\nNOTE: Figure 1 displays a schematic of the hardware requirements to integrate the peripheral electrical and TMS stimulators with a computer-controlled sensorimotor task. Figure 2A depicts the setup for SAI for PA-induced and AP-induced current. Figure 2B illustrates the sequence of events for the cued sensorimotor task and the relative timing of the SAI assessment. A stereotactic guidance system to track the TMS coil orientation relative to the participant is strongly recommended to reduce trial-by-trial variability in the physiological response associated with variation in coil position and trajectory61.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65212/65212fig01.jpg",
    "Figure 1: A schematic of the hardware used to assess SAI at rest and during concurrent sensorimotor behavior. PC1, which is used to control the sensorimotor task and the timing of the cTMS stimulus/peripheral electrical stimulation, is connected to a digital-to-analog converter capable of generating a 5 V TTL output trigger via a USB cable. For unconditioned trials, the trigger from digital input-output channel 1 is sent to the cTMS stimulator via a BNC cable. For conditioned trials, the trigger from digital input-output channel 1, which is sent to the cTMS stimulator, is preceded by a trigger from digital input-output channel 2 to the peripheral electrical stimulator. A BNC cable from the trigger out channel on the cTMS unit is sent to the EMG system analog-to-digital board to trigger the EMG amplifier recording and the display/saving of the data by the EMG acquisition software on PC2. An optional BNC cable from the cTMS trigger out is also sent to the stereotactic guidance system to record the coil position and trajectory at the time of the cTMS stimulus. Abbreviations: PC = personal computer; USB = universal serial bus; TTL = transistor-transistor logic trigger cable; BNC = Bayonet Neill-Concelman connector; cTMS = controllable pulse parameter transcranial magnetic stimulator; TMS = transcranial magnetic stimulation; A/D = analog-digital; EMG = electromyography.

Of note, the induced current in the brain is opposite to the direction of the current in the TMS coil. (B) A depiction of a valid index finger cue (top) and invalid index finger cue (bottom) trial. The cue is always depicted as the top stimulus (highlighted by the dashed circle). The cue color corresponds to a specific finger response. The participants were instructed to respond to the probe color as fast and accurately as possible. Cues and probes could be any color. The probability of a valid cue was 70%. Invalid cues occurred in 30% of trials.

Randomize the interval between any two stimuli (e.g., conditioned or unconditioned) using a rectangular distribution with a duration between 5-8 s.\n\t\nEnsure that the routine sends one digital output trigger to the trigger in the port of the cTMS unit for the unconditioned stimuli. Ensure that the routine sends separate digital outputs to the cTMS unit and the peripheral electrical stimulator for the conditioned stimuli.",
    "Ensure the trigger to the peripheral stimulator precedes the cTMS trigger by 21 ms. Ensure the number of unconditioned and conditioned stimuli is between 8 and 24. Ideally, the order of the unconditioned and conditioned trials should be randomized.\nSet up a software routine to control the sensorimotor task. Ensure this software also time-locks the digital output triggers sent to the cTMS and peripheral electrical stimulators to a specific point(s) during the behavior.\n\tNOTE: The outlined experiment used a cued sensorimotor task (Figure 2B). The triggers to the peripheral stimulator and cTMS stimulator were timed to occur 225-275 ms after the response cue onset using a rectangular distribution. The purpose of this timing was to assess changes in sensorimotor integration based on the validity between the response cue and the prior preparation cue, which was valid in 70% of all trials.\nEquip a second personal computer (PC2) with a two-channel electromyography (EMG) amplifier connected to an analog-digital converter. Ensure that the digital-analog converter has a digital input channel to time-lock the EMG to the TMS stimulus. Ensure PC2 is equipped with EMG data acquisition software to record the TMS-evoked muscle responses.\n\tNOTE: PC1 can be used to control the sensorimotor task and record the EMG. However, researchers should independently verify the timing of the triggers to the TMS stimulator, peripheral stimulator, and EMG system. Multiple devices connected to a single PC increase the potential for central processor conflicts, leading to instability in the relative timing of the event markers.",
    "Set up the EMG data acquisition software with the following settings: three recording channels, 2 EMG, one input trigger, triggered recordings with an epoch of −0.3 s to 0.5 s around the TTL trigger, an EMG amplification factor of 1,000x, a sampling rate of 4,000 Hz, a bandpass filter of 3 Hz to 1 kHz, and a mains filter (optional).\n\t​NOTE: The current protocol uses an epoched recording method. The EMG acquisition software continuously monitors the EMG signal. However, only epoched data time-locked to the TMS stimulus are displayed and recorded.\nConnect one digital output channel from PC1 to the trigger input on the cTMS stimulator. Connect the second digital output channel from PC1 to the trigger input on the peripheral electrical stimulator. When using the PC's operating system, independently confirm the relative timing of the two digital outputs from PC1.\nConnect the trigger output to the digital input of the EMG system. If using a stereotactic guidance system, it may be possible to split the trigger output to the guidance system to record the trial by trial position of the cTMS coil at the time of the cTMS stimulus.\n2. Participant screening and informed consent\nScreen the participant for contraindications to TMS9,62,63,64,65.\nInform the participant about the study objectives and procedures. Review the risks outlined in the institution's ethics review board-approved consent document. Answer any questions about the potential risks. Obtain written informed consent before beginning any study procedures.\n3. Electromyography (EMG) electrode placement\nInstruct the participant to sit in the experimental chair with their elbows resting on the arms of the chair and bent to allow the wrist/hand to rest comfortably on the desk workspace. Adjust the height of the chair and desk workspace as needed.",
    "Clean the skin over the first dorsal interosseous (FDI), abductor pollicis brevis (APB), and the ulnar styloid process using a mildly abrasive cream placed on a round cotton pad. Wipe any residue away using an alcohol prep pad.\nFor each muscle, place one disposable Ag-AgCl adhesive electrode over the muscle belly. Place a second electrode on a nearby bony landmark as a reference. Finally, place one additional Ag-AgCl adhesive electrode on the ulnar styloid process to serve as a ground.\n\tNOTE: A common FDI reference site is the bony prominence at the base of the second proximal phalanx on the radial side of the hand. A common APB reference site is the proximal phalanx's bony prominence on the thumb's radial side.\nConnect each pair of electrodes and the ground to the EMG amplifier and data acquisition system. Use channel 1 for the FDI and channel 2 for the APB.\n4. Peripheral electrical stimulator electrode placement\nConnect the digital output trigger of the peripheral stimulator to the trigger input channel on the EMG system to trigger EMG recording when the peripheral stimulus is delivered.\nUse a mildly abrasive cream to clean the skin on the inside of the forearm. Start from the wrist flexion crease and extend to ~6 cm proximal. Extend cleaning to the area starting from the wrist midline to the radial side of the forearm. Wipe away any residue using an alcohol prep pad.\nApply conducting gel to a reusable stimulating bar electrode. Use just enough gel to cover the metal disks of the anodal and cathodal contact points. Place the stimulating electrode over the skin on the palmar side of the wrist with the cathode proximal to the anode. Place the cathode slightly medial and proximal to the radial styloid process.",
    "Do not use excessive gel. If the gel creates a bridge between the anode and cathode terminals, clean the electrode to remove all the gel, and reapply. A gel bridge between the anode and cathode will divert substantial currents along the skin, making it difficult to stimulate the median nerve.\nOn the peripheral stimulator, set the stimulus type selector to monophasic, set the stimulus duration to 200 µs, and select an appropriate voltage and amperage, double-checking any multiplication factors. The voltage (Vmax) was set to 200 V for the hardware used here, with an initial amperage of 0.05 x 10 mA.\nWhile holding the stimulating electrode, deliver a single electrical stimulus by depressing the trigger switch on the constant current stimulator. Then, visually inspect the APB muscle and the EMG display (channel 2) for evidence of a muscle contraction. The muscle contraction, known as the M-wave, is elicited by direct activation of the motor axon by the electrical stimulus and should occur between 6-9 ms after the peripheral electrical stimulus artifact.\nIf there is no evidence of a muscle contraction, then ask the participant if they felt a tingling sensation radiating toward the fingers or immediately underneath the electrode. The optimal position will be the electrode position that elicits the most significant APB muscle contraction at the current stimulus intensity.\n\t\nIf no sensation is reported or the sensation is restricted to the skin immediately below the electrode, then increase the amperage in increments of 0.05 (multiplied by a factor of 10) until the participant reports a tingling sensation radiating up to the fingers/thumb. If a radiating sensation is reported in a digit other than the thumb, reposition the electrode by moving the electrode radially until the feeling radiates to the thumb.",
    "Once the optimal position of the stimulating electrode has been determined, secure the electrode to the wrist using three pieces of tape. Position the first piece over the middle of the electrode, and then use the second and third pieces to secure the top and bottom of the electrode.\n\tNOTE: Based on experience, it is suggested to first secure the band of tape to the back of the electrode and then run the tape down the side of the electrode to the skin. This approach seems to secure the electrode and minimizes the potential for lateral movement during the experiment.\nAfter securing the electrode, ask the participant to assume the desired limb orientation to be used during TMS stimulation. Check to make sure a thumb twitch is still elicited.\n5. Determination of the median nerve stimulus intensity\nDetermine the peripheral stimulus threshold by adjusting the amperage of the peripheral stimulus intensity until an M-wave of 0.2 mV is elicited37,56. If the M-wave exceeds the desired 0.2 mV target amplitude on three successive stimuli, then decrease the amperage. If the M-wave is below the desired 0.2 mV target amplitude on three subsequent stimuli, increase the amperage. The threshold is the first amperage value where the M-wave exceeds 0.2 mV.\n\tNOTE: A common alternative is to set the intensity to either 3x the perceptual sensory threshold or 1x the motor threshold11,16,17,66,67,68. The sensory threshold is the stimulus intensity at which participants correctly report a sensation on 5 of 10 electrical stimuli. The motor threshold is the stimulus intensity at which a visible twitch is elicited on 5 of 10 stimuli.\n6. Determination of the optimal coil trajectory for transcranial magnetic stimulation",
    "Use a template magnetic resonance image (MRI) file to create a new stereotactic guidance system project file to monitor the participant's position and coil orientation. Then, connect the digital output trigger from the TMS stimulator to the trigger input channel on the EMG system to trigger the EMG recording when the TMS stimulus is delivered.\n\tNOTE: When available, a subject-specific MRI may be used. However, the MEP is sufficient to determine the optimal coil position for motor cortex stimulation studies.\nAffix the guidance system's coil tracking tool to the PA TMS coil. Use the coil calibration tool to calibrate the orientation of the coil tracking tool to the midpoint of the TMS coil. Repeat this step using a second coil tracking tool for an AP coil with identical geometry to the PA coil.\nAffix the guidance system's subject-tracking tool to the forehead of the participant using two EMG electrodes. Use a fine-tip dry-erase marker or eye-liner applicator to place markings on the middle of the nose tip, the nasion, and the left and right preauricular pits. Use the guidance system's subject calibration tool to touch and record the position of each marker.\nSet an initial coil position by placing the coil on the participant's head and recording the coil trajectory. Ensure the center surface of the coil is tangential to the scalp. Align the midline of the coil at 45° to the mid-sagittal plane of the participant's head.\n\t\nTo obtain a starting approximation of the motor cortex hotspot, imagine a tangential line connecting a point 5 cm anterior to the vertex and 5 cm lateral to the vertex, and place a 70 mm coil at approximately 2 cm from the anterior point along the tangential line.",
    "NOTE: An alternate approach to approximate the cortical motor hotspot for the distal muscles of the contralateral hand is for the experimenter to place their left index finger (if stimulating over the participant's left motor cortex) on the head vertex and the thumb of the left hand on the preauricular point of the left ear. The position of the index finger metacarpophalangeal joint can be used to visualize an approximate position at which to place the coil center.\nOn the cTMS stimulator, set the pulse type selector to Monophasic-Positive to induce a PA current in the underlying neural tissue. Next, set the M-ratio to 0.2 and the stimulus intensity (also known as the power) to 30% of the maximal stimulator output. Finally, set the pulse width (also known as the positive phase duration) to 120 µs (the longest pulse width used in the study).\n\tNOTE: The coil position and trajectory determined using the PA-induced current will be employed for the AP-induced current16,36,37,38,56,69.\nDeliver three to five TMS stimuli while the participant maintains a slight contraction of the FDI muscle (~5%-10% of maximum voluntary contraction). If no motor-evoked potential (MEP) is elicited, increase the stimulator intensity by 10%, and deliver three to five additional TMS stimuli.\nRepeat the previous step until an MEP of at least 0.2 mV is consistently elicited to every stimulus, or until the stimulator intensity reaches 60%-70% of the maximal stimulator output. If no reliable MEP is elicited, keep the stimulation parameters constant, and move the TMS stimulator in a circle with ~2 cm diameter around the original stimulation site. Increase the circle's diameter by 1 cm if a reliable MEP is still not elicited at any point in the original circle.",
    "Once a reliable MEP is elicited, confirm the FDI motor hotspot by keeping the stimulation parameters constant and moving the TMS stimulator 2 cm north, east, south, and west of the current coil location. Deliver three to five TMS stimuli at each location70. Record the new coil position and trajectory if a consistently larger MEP is elicited at any of the four quadrants. Use the new coil position and trajectory as the cortical motor hotspot.\n7. Determination of the stimulus intensity for transcranial magnetic stimulation\nLaunch the freely available TMS motor threshold assessment tool (MTAT 2.1)71,72,73 to determine the stimulus intensity required to elicit an MEP of 1 mV (1 mV threshold)16,67,74. Set the estimation method to Without a priori information, and click on Start.\n\tNOTE: The current protocol uses a TMS intensity of 1 mV16. However, some studies prefer to set the intensity as 120% of the individual's resting motor threshold. For AP current, a 1 mV MEP may not be obtainable. In such cases, determine the stimulator output that elicits the maximal MEP elicited by the AP stimulus configuration, provided the maximum MEP is at least 0.5 mV.\nDetermine the maximum stimulator output available for the pulse width of 120 µs. Then, use a conversion chart to rescale the range of the stimulator output from 0 to 100 so that the stimulator output matches the scale of the MTAT 2.1 software.",
    "NOTE: For the model used in the current study, the maximal stimulator output for a pulse width of 120 µs is 50%. Therefore, the values provided by the MTAT 2.1 software are divided by 2 to determine the value set on the stimulator. For a pulse width of 70 µs, the maximal stimulator output is 66%, so all the values provided by the MTAT 2.1 software are multiplied by 0.66 (and rounded to the nearest 0.5%). For a pulse width of 30 µs, the maximal stimulator output is 100%. Therefore, no scaling adjustment is necessary.\nSet the TMS stimulator intensity to the initial percentage of maximal stimulator output indicated by the MTAT 2.1 software and deliver a single TMS stimulus. If the recorded MEP in the 20-50 ms time range after the TMS stimulus exceeds 1 mV, indicate \"yes\" by pressing the Y key. If the recorded MEP is less than 1 mV, indicate \"no\" by pressing the N key. Repeat this step until the stimulus intensity displayed by the MTAT software changes from black to green.\n\tNOTE: The initial value indicated by the MTAT 2.1 software is always 37%. For a pulse width of 120 µs, the actual stimulator value is 18.5%. For a pulse width of 70 µs, the actual stimulator value is 24%. For a pulse width of 30 µs, the stimulator value is 37%.\nRepeat for each combination of current direction and stimulus duration. For AP current, rotate the current direction to 180° by physically rotating the coil to induce the PA current by 180°, or utilize a custom coil manufactured to induce AP current.",
    "​NOTE: When using multiple TMS current directions and pulse widths, all the thresholds may be determined before the data collection or just before using that specific combination of current direction and pulse width in the protocol.\n8. Short-latency afferent inhibition (no task baseline)\nAttach the coil that will induce the PA current in the brain to the cTMS stimulator. Set the pulse type to Monophasic-Positive and the M-ratio to 0.2. Set the pulse width to 120 µs. Finally, set the stimulus intensity to the 1 mV threshold determined in step 7.\n\tNOTE: If using both PA and AP current directions, the order in which step 8 is conducted should be randomized across participants. If using multiple pulse widths, the order in which step 8 is performed should be counterbalanced across participants. PA120 and AP30 were the only current configurations employed in the described experiment.\nSet the peripheral electrical stimulus intensity to the intensity determined in step 5. Then, launch the no-task software routine on PC1. Next, set the interstimulus interval between the peripheral electrical and TMS stimuli to 21 ms.\nPosition the TMS coil over the FDI motor hotspot determined in step 6. Ask the participant to hold a slight contraction of the FDI muscle (~5%-10% of maximum voluntary contraction). Next, run the no-task software on PC1 to trigger both the peripheral and cTMS stimulators.\nRepeat the steps for the AP30 current configuration using the coil that induces AP current in the brain.\n\t​NOTE: It is recommended that the no-task baseline be repeated at the end of the experiment, time permitting. The pre- and post-no-task SAI assessments are strongly advised in order to provide an SAI baseline and to establish any pre-existing differences between groups (if applicable).\n9. Short-latency afferent inhibition (Sensorimotor task)",
    "Attach the PA coil to the cTMS stimulator. Set the pulse type to Monophasic-Positive and the M-ratio to 0.2. Set the pulse width to 120 µs. Finally, set the stimulus intensity to the 1 mV threshold determined in step 7.\n\tNOTE: When using multiple TMS current configurations (e.g., PA120, AP30), the current configuration employed during the sensorimotor task should be counterbalanced across the participants. Using the same counterbalancing used to determine the order for the no-task baseline assessment is recommended.\nSet the peripheral electrical stimulus intensity to the intensity determined in step 5. Then, launch the sensorimotor task software routine on PC1. Set the interstimulus interval between the peripheral electrical and TMS stimuli to 21 ms.\nPosition the TMS coil over the FDI motor hotspot determined in step 6. Ask the participant to hold a slight contraction of the FDI muscle (~5%-10% of maximum voluntary contraction).\nRun the sensorimotor task software routine to control the sensorimotor task and send the behavior-locked digital triggers to the peripheral and cTMS stimulators. Keep the desired number of unconditioned and conditioned trials between 8 and 24 stimuli per condition.\nRepeat the steps for the AP30 current configuration using the coil to induce AP current in the brain.\n10. Data processing and analysis\nVisually inspect the EMG data offline and discard any traces in which the root mean square of the prestimulus EMG (−50 to stimulus onset) exceeds a criterion amplitude. Calculate the root mean square error for each trial as follows:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65212/65212eq01.jpg",
    "where N is the number of data points between −50 and stimulus onset, and the EMG is the voltage at point n. For SAI conducted with the muscle at rest, use a criterion amplitude of 10-15 µV. For SAI assessed with a slight tonic contraction, use a criterion amplitude that is the average RMSE across all the trials plus two standard deviations, assuming contraction levels were monitored during the study.\nFor each trial, calculate the peak-to-peak MEP amplitude for the FDI as the difference between the minimum and maximum values in the time window between 20 ms to 50 ms post-TMS stimulus artifact in channel 170.\nFor the conditioned trials, calculate the peak-to-peak M-wave amplitude for the APB as the peak-to-peak amplitude 5 ms to 15 ms post-peripheral stimulus artifact in channel 2.\n\tNOTE: Calculating the peak-to-peak M-wave amplitude is a method to confirm that the stimulus intensity did not vary across the conditions throughout the experiment.\nCalculate the mean MEP amplitude for the unconditioned and conditioned trials and the mean M-wave for conditioned trials for each combination of TMS current direction, pulse width, and behavioral condition.\nExpress the conditioned MEP amplitude as a ratio of the unconditioned MEP amplitude for each participant using the equation below11:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65212/65212eq02.jpg\n\tNOTE: Lower ratios reflect more potent inhibition. Multiplying the ratio by 100% is common to express the conditioned MEP amplitude as a percentage of the unconditioned MEP amplitude.\nCalculate the mean across all the participants for each TMS current direction, pulse width, and behavioral condition combination. Report these values. Although mean values are generally reported, demonstrate individual data in figures where possible.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
