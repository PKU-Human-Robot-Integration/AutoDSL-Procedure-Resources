    "1. Preparing small molecule samples\nTransfer a small amount (0.01 - 1 mg) of powder, liquid, or solids into a small vial or tube.\nFor samples already in powder form, seal the tube using the cap until the sample is needed. Dry the liquid samples into powders prior to attempts at method 1 (step 3) or 2 (step 4).\n\t​NOTE: Samples dissolved in liquid may use method 3 (5.X) below\n2. Preparing TEM grids\nNOTE: Some TEMs with autoloader systems require that the grids be clipped and placed into a cassette prior to loading into the TEM column. Clipping involves physically securing the 3 mm TEM grid into a metal ring that the autoloader can manipulate. This step and subsequent steps can be performed using either normal TEM grids, or TEM grids that have been clipped. For these experiments, it is often easier to manipulate the grids if they have been clipped ahead of time.\nWrap plastic film around one end of a glass cover slide.\nPlace the TEM grids onto the film on the top of the cover slide with the carbon side facing up. Identify the two sides of the grid under a light. The copper side shines and appears metallic, whereas the carbon side appears a drab, brown color (Figure 1C,D). For clipped grids, the carbon side should face the flat face of the clip ring.\nPlace the slide with grids into the glow discharge chamber. Glow discharge the coverside for approximately 30 s using the negative setting at 15 pA. Store the grids on the cover slide inside of a glass Petri dish lined with filter paper prior to adding sample to the grids.\n3. Applying sample to grids by creating a homogenous fine powder (Method 1)",
    "Remove a glow discharged TEM grid from the covered Petri dish using tweezers. Place the grid onto a circular filter paper with the carbon side facing up.\nUsing a small spatula, remove a very small scoop of powder (approximately 0.1 mg) and place it onto a small, square, glass coverslip just next to the TEM grid on the filter paper. Place another small square glass slide or coverslip on top of the powder.\nWith fingers, gently rub the two glass slides together to make a fine powder.\nAngle the coverslips and position them just above the TEM grid on the filter paper and continue to rub the coverslips together, just a few cm above the glow discharged TEM grid (Figure 1).\nObserve to see if the powder is falling towards the grid. Uncover the finely ground powder by removing one of the two glass coverslips. Gently brush the fine powder off of the coverslip using a piece of filter paper onto the TEM grid (Figure 1).\n4. Applying sample to grids by applying the \"shaking\" method (Method 2)\nGrab a grid using a pair of tweezers and drop it into the vial or tube of powder sample. Close the vial using the plastic cap to ensure no material will escape when shaken.\nGrabbing the vial in the hand, shake the vial such that the powder and grid are both moving for approximately 10 - 30 s.\nEmpty the vial contents onto a circular filter paper. Grabbing the grid on an edge, gently tap the grid edge on the filter paper to remove any excess material from the grid.\n\t​NOTE: Depending on the type of vial and size, one may also use tweezers to remove the TEM grid without emptying the contents.",
    "5. Applying sample to grids using the evaporation method (Method 3)\nPlace a grid (clipped or not) onto the center of a circular piece of filter paper with the carbon side facing up and the copper side facing down.\nUsing a 10 µL gas-tight syringe, apply a small drop (approximately 1 - 3 µL) of dissolved compound onto the carbon side of the grid.\nGently move the filter paper with grids into a vacuum desiccation chamber. Cover the chamber and turn on the vacuum. Leave the grids under vacuum to dry for up to one day.\nTurn off the vacuum and allow the chamber to vent for 5 min. Venting the chamber avoids the grids moving or flying away when it is uncovered.\n6. Freezing and loading grids into the TEM\nGrab the edge of the TEM grid using a set of tweezers, assuring that the tips do not puncture any of the grid squares. Lift the grid 1 - 2 cm above the filter paper and angle the grid at 90° to the paper below. Gently tap the tweezers while keeping the grid firmly tweezed to remove any loose powder.\nFreeze the grid by moving the tip of the tweezers with the grid directly into a liquid nitrogen container by hand. This container is typically the grid loading station for the TEM, but can be any safe container, such as a liquid nitrogen safe thermos, is acceptable for transferring or storage. Liquid nitrogen is -196 °C.\nWait until the grid and tweezers stop boiling before further manipulations.\nUnder liquid nitrogen or in nitrogen vapors, place the grid in the sample holder with the carbon side oriented such that the sample will be hit by the beam prior to the carbon support film.",
    "Load the sample holder into the TEM assuring that the grid is kept at liquid nitrogen temperatures at all times.\n\t\nFor autoloader systems, place the clipped grids into a cassette in a liquid nitrogen cooled container. This cassette transferred into a shuttling container than allows the autoloader robotics to accept the cassette while keeping the samples safe for shuttling between the autoloader and the column.\nFor side-entry TEM setups, secure the grid to a commercial side-entry TEM holder. These holders have a sample preparation container that is filled with liquid nitrogen to allow transfer of the grid to the holder without warming the sample. The side-entry holder is inserted into the TEM directly with the sample secured at the end.\n7. Collecting MicroED data\nLocating and screening nanocrystals\n\t\nOpen the TEM column valves. Adjust the magnification using the hand panels to the lowest magnification possible. Find the beam by adjusting the intensity knob on the hand panels such that a round, bright area is visible on the fluorescent screen.\nTake an all-grid atlas at a low magnification (50 - 300x) using appropriate software14,15,16 (Figure 2). Ensure that the microscope is well aligned for both low and high magnification imaging prior to collecting high-resolution MicroED data.\nIdentify grid squares without broken carbon and have a visible black or dark material/grains on the film (Figure 2). Navigate around the grid, either physically using the joystick on the hand panels, or virtually on the collected Atlas, in order to search for grid squares that are not broken and contain microcrystals.\nAdd the center of each of these squares to a list of grid locations for investigation. These locations can be added to a notebook, in the microscope user interface, or in microscope automation software.",
    "Increase the magnification to 500-1,300x and adjust the eucentric height at each stored grid location and update the saved Z value to the positions noted in 7.1.4.\nSearch either on the fluorescent screen or on a fast camera at this higher magnification for small black spots/grains on the grid. A good sample with often have sharp edges at high magnification, suggesting crystalline order.\nMove a located potential crystal to the center of the screen and increase the magnification such that the TEM enters high magnification mode.\n\t\tNOTE: This is referred to as either high-magnification, Zoom2, or SA mode on different instruments and typically corresponds to magnifications of 3,000x or higher.\nInsert a selected area aperture. Change the aperture to a larger or smaller size to assure that the selected area is just larger than the crystal (Figure 3).\nSwitch to diffraction mode by pressing the diffraction button on the TEM hand panels, assuring that the fluorescent screen is inserted. Adjust the camera length using the magnification knob such that the edge is at least 1 Å resolution.\n\t\tNOTE: Calibration of the diffraction lengths should be performed by a service engineer using a gold waffle grating or known specimen prior to attempting MicroED experiments.\nAdjust the diffraction focus such that the central spot is as sharp and small as possible. Using the diffraction shift knobs, move the central beam to the center of the fluorescent screen\nInsert the beam stop and make sure the beam is behind it. Lift the fluorescent screen. Take a short (approximately 1 s) exposure on the camera (Figure 4).",
    "Inspect the corresponding diffraction pattern. A good candidate for collecting a full dataset will have sharp spots that are regularly arranged in columns and rows, and the diffraction will extent to beyond 2 Å, preferably at least to 1 Å (Figure 4). Save the crystal coordinates in either the TEM user interface or by writing them down.\nRepeat diffraction screening for all the potential crystals of interest on the current grid square.\nData collection\n\t\nCenter a screened crystal on the screen at a high magnification (> 1,000x). Adjust the eucentric height of the crystal using either an automatic routine or by hand.\nInsert the selected area aperture that best fits the crystal size and shape as determined in 7.1.8 (Figure 3). Tilt the stage in the negative and positive directions until the image is occluded by the grid bars (Figure 3). Note these angles for data collection purposes.\nDetermine the number of frames that will be required to span the total angular wedge of the dataset. It is typical to use 0.5 - 1.0° wedges for each frame, with frames being read out every 1 to 5s depending on the sensitivity of the camera. For example, a wedge spanning from -30° to +30°, rotating at a constant rate of 1° s-1 with a frame read out every 1s, would require 60 total frames.\nConsidering the maximum total tilt range of -72° to +72°, begin rotating the stage at a constant rate of 1° s-1 and then begin reading the data out every 1s on a modern camera with a rolling shutter readout mode (Movie 1). This process can be performed manually or by using TEM specific software.",
    "Set the rotation rate by specifying the % of the maximum tilt speed and when to stop in the microscope user interface or dedicated software. In this investigation, this was measured to be 0.3° s-1 for each % of maximum speed but will need to be independently verified for each microscope.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The tilting and camera data collection are set up independently here, but software programs14 can coordinate this to simplify the process.\nDiscard approximately 1° on each side of the specified wedge in most cases as dead time, where the stage is either ramping up or slowing down to the desired rotation speed.\nSave data in a variety of formats as either individual frames or as a stack of images (Movie 1).\nConvert these diffraction frames to a typical crystallographic format using MicroED tools -available here (https://cryoem.ucla.edu). Diffraction images saved in SMV format are readily processed using documented crystallographic software17,18.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
