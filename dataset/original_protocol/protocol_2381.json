    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nMouse Perfusion\nTiming: ∼20 min per mouse\nMouse perfusion is critical and the most difficult part of this protocol. Successful perfusion allows PFA solution to go through the circulation system from the left ventricle to the right atrium of the heart. For beginners, it takes some practices to be experienced in the mouse perfusion. In general, it is helpful to perform the perfusion in a place where you could position your hands comfortably and with sufficient lighting.\nPlace a 250 mL beaker with cold 1× PBS on ice, 30 mL 1× PBS per mouse. Label it as “PBS.”\nPrepare 0.5% PFA solution freshly, 30 mL per mouse (refer to Materials and Equipment for the buffer recipe). Place a 250 mL beaker with cold 0.5% PFA on ice. Label it as “PFA.”\nPlace a 250 mL beaker with cold 2 M glycine on ice, 30 mL per mouse. Label it as “Glycine.”\nPrepare the perfusion syringe by adapting a 25-gauge needle to a 10 mL syringe. Prepare a total of three syringes and label them as “PBS,” “PFA,” and “Glycine,” respectively.\nCritical: To better control the incision when you pierce the heart using a needle and inject the solution, it is recommended to use a piece of tape to wrap below the pointy end of the needle (See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). If the incision is too deep, the needle will pierce through the left ventricle to the left atrium, and the solution will pass through the pulmonary circulation (See Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] for details) and result in a failure of fixation. If the incision is too shallow, the PFA solution may not enter the left ventricle, which also leads to a failure of fixation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/202-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Example of a Wrapped Needle",
    "Illustration (A) and image (B) of how the needle is wrapped by the tape to control the depth of the incision.\nAnesthetize the mouse. We administrate ∼400 μL 1.2% Avertin solution for a 20 g mouse (2,2,2-Tribromoethanol 250 mg/kg body weight of the mouse) through intraperitoneal injection. Alternative anesthetization methods can be used.\nAfter the mouse is anesthetized, lay the mouse on the dissection board in a supine position. Stabilize its feet with tapes/needles. Open the chest and expose the heart for perfusion (See Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nUse the forceps to pick up the skin around the bottom of the sternum (the highest point of the mouse chest when lying down). Make an incision using a pair of scissors.\nUse the forceps to lift the bottom of the sternum and cut along the diaphragm using the scissors. Try to hold the forceps high and keep the scissor tip up to avoid damaging any organ.\nLift the rib cage and expose the heart.\nMake an incision on the right atrium (in a deep red color) using the scissors (i.e., Fine Scissors-ToughCut, 14058-11, FST) so the blood can bleed out (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nMethods Video S1\nVideo of the Chest Opening, Right Atrium Incision, and Perfusion. Related to Step 6\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/202-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic Illustration of the Incision Sites of the Heart\nUse blunt-end forceps to gently hold the heart, then pierce the heart near the bottom of the left ventricle using the perfusion syringe (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Perfuse 10 mL cold PBS using a 10 mL syringe with a 25G needle to wash away the blood. While you are piercing into the heart and pushing the solution in, the pressure would spontaneously draw the needle into the left ventricle (See Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).",
    "Critical: After the needle is already pierced into the left ventricle, keep the tip of the needle slightly tilted up at ∼60° above the horizontal line (See Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). Then you can stabilize your syringe with the blunt-end forceps during perfusion, making sure the syringe does not pierce into the left atrium during perfusion.\nNote: A sign of good perfusion is that the solution comes out from the right atrium. Usually, the liver will become pale within a few seconds (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/202-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Image of Liver Before and After Perfusion\nImage of the mouse liver (A) before and (B) after perfusion. The dotted white square shows the liver.\nRepeat step 7 twice, so perfuse a total of 30 mL cold PBS three times (10 mL PBS each time).\nNote: When exposing the heart under the dissection light, you should be able to see the incision site of the needle. Try to inject into the same site when you repeat the perfusion step. Under good lighting conditions, you would see the incision site already after PBS perfusion (See Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). Thus, it is critical to perform perfusion under sufficient light.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/202-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Image of the Incision Site by the Needle after PBS or PFA Perfusion\nImage of the incision site by the needle (A) after PBS perfusion and (B) after PFA perfusion. Arrows point to the incision site. The dotted white circle indicates the tissue around the incision site after PFA perfusion, which becomes white.",
    "Start a 5 min timer. Perfuse 10 mL cold 0.5% PFA using a 10 mL syringe with a 25-gauge needle 3 times, so the total perfusion volume is 30 mL. The speed of the perfusion is around 10 mL solution in 1 min by hand perfusion (See Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). Wait until the timer rings so the total fixation time is 5 min.\nNote: Right after the first PFA perfusion, you will notice the tissue around the incision site becomes rigid and white (See Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). From this point on, it should be easy to see the incision site and inject the solution into the same site again.\nPerfuse 10 mL cold 2 M glycine using a 10 mL syringe with a 25-gauge needle 3 times, so the total perfusion volume is 30 mL.\nNote: After perfusion, the tail of the mouse will become rigid. Usually, a light fixative (0.5% PFA) would not make the muscles very rigid, so you should not feel a huge difference when touching the muscles after perfusion.\nFACS Preparation + Sorting\nTiming: FACS preparation, 3–4 h for 1–4 mice; cell sorting, 1 h for 1 mouse if a high-speed sorter is used (i.e., BD influx)\nFACS preparation involves a series of enzyme digestions and washing steps to obtain single-cell suspension from the tissue. The FACS preparation for unfixed SCs was previously published in Liu et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]. We further optimized it for a higher yield. The FACS preparation protocol for unfixed SCs and fixed SCs are very similar except for step 17 (A total of 10,000 U Collagenase II is used for unfixed SC isolation while a total of 20,000 U Collagenase II is used for fixed SC isolation).\nPour ∼10 mL cold Wash Medium into a 10 cm glass petri dish.",
    "Use a No.11 blade and scissors to dissect the hindlimb muscles out. Put them into the petri dish.\nTake the muscle pieces out. Mince them with a No.20 blade on the cover of the glass petri dish.\nNote: Fixed muscles are slightly more rigid compared with the unfixed muscles. You may notice the resistance when you mince the muscles using the blade.\nPour ∼2 mL first enzyme digestion solution to the minced muscle slurry. Use scissors to further cut it.\nPour the muscle slurry back to the first enzyme digestion solution in a 50 mL conical tube.\nWrap the cap of the 50 mL tube with parafilm to prevent leakage.\nFirst enzyme digestion: Put the tube into the 37°C shaking water bath at medium-high speed for 90 min.\nNote: The Collagenase II used in the first enzyme digestion for fixed cells is 2,000 U/mL × 10 mL, which doubles the amount compared with the enzyme used for unfixed cells (1,000 U/mL × 10 mL).\nOptional: Pre-cool the centrifuge 5408R to 4°C.\nAfter the first enzyme digestion, take the tube out and fill it up with cold Wash Medium (50 mL in total). Flip the tube upside down for a few times to mix.\nPour 25 mL of the slurry to another tube. Fill up both tubes with cold Wash Medium (50 mL in total for each tube).\nNote: Splitting the slurry into two tubes helps to reduce the complexity of the solution for debris clearing.\nCentrifuge at 500 × g, 4°C, for 10 min using the centrifuge 5408R.\nNote: During the centrifugation, warm the Collagenase II and Dispase II aliquots on a 37°C heat block.\nTake the tubes out carefully. Use the aspirator to aspirate away the Wash Medium till ∼12.5 mL solution remains.",
    "Note: Place a 1 mL pipette tip in front of the aspirator to avoid aspirating too fast. Do not disrupt the pellet.\nAdd 1 mL Collagenase II (3,000 U/mL) and 1 mL Dispase II (30 U/mL) to one tube. Mix it by pipetting up and down 5 times using a 25 mL serological pipette.\nNote: Dispase II may have precipitates after long term storage, but it does not affect the second digestion. You can spin the precipitates down and use only the supernatant. Either way works in our lab.\nTransfer the solution with enzymes to another tube. Mix it by pipetting up and down 5 times using the same 25 mL serological pipette.\nAdd cold Wash Medium to 30 mL (i.e., the concentration of the second digestion enzyme is 100 U/mL for Collagenase and 1 U/mL for Dispase II).\nSecond enzyme digestion: Put the tube into the 37°C shaking water bath at medium-high speed for 30 min. Wrap the cap of the 50 mL tube with parafilm to prevent leakage.\nAfter the second enzyme digestion, mix the cell solution using a 30 mL syringe adapted to a 20-gauge needle ten times.\nNote: It is important to syringe the cell solution ten times to obtain high yield. Any undigested small muscle pieces that clog the needle should be removed.\nFilter the cell solution with a 40 μm filter adapted to a new 50 mL conical tube.\nAdd cold Wash Medium to 50 mL.\nCentrifuge at 500 × g, 4°C, for 10 min using the centrifuge 5408R.\nTake the tubes out carefully. Use the aspirator to aspirate away the Wash Medium until ∼2–3 mL solution remains.",
    "Note: Place a 1 mL pipette tip in front of the aspirator to avoid aspirating too fast. Furthermore, place a 200 μL pipette tip in front of the aspirator when the solution goes down to ∼15 mL, and do not disrupt the pellet. Aspirate until the solution reaches 2–3 mL.\nUse a 1 mL pipette to resuspend the cell solution. Filter the cell solution with a 40 μm filter adapted to a new 50 mL conical tube.\nTransfer the single-cell suspension to a 5 mL round-bottom polypropylene tube as the loading tube.\nNote: If using size calibration beads for size reference, dilute individual size beads at around 1:100 in PBS respectively in each loading tube (i.e., add 3 μL beads to 297 μL PBS). Sonicate the beads before usage to avoid aggregates. Load individual size beads and record ∼1,000–2,000 events for each beads.\nSort cells using a cell sorter.\nNote: For Pax7nGFP mice, SCs are marked by GFP signals. Gate for singlets and then the GFP+ population (See sorting scheme in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). Our lab usually uses a BD Influx cell sorter for cell sorting. The sorting time is ∼1 h per mouse worth of single-cell suspension.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/202-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. FACS Gating Plots and Size Analysis of pSCs and fSCs\nFACS plot and population hierarchy of fSCs and pSCs. Each gate shows the enrichment corresponding to the mononuclear cell population amount of the total cell population in the previous gate. The forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) analysis plots of the size calibration beads are used as size references. The FSC and SSC analysis of fSC and pSC populations are revealed in pseudocolor plots. The sort plots have previously been published in Yue et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4].",
    "Collect the sorted cells in a 5 mL round-bottom polypropylene tube with 1 mL cold Wash Medium. Sorting does not need to be at 4°C.\nRNA Isolation from Fixed Cells [Optional]\nTiming: ∼1.5 h\nThe RNA isolation protocol was adapted from the manufacturer’s protocol with modifications (Thomsen et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). 100K fSCs are tested and sufficient for RNA isolation and later library generation step. To handle RNA, all pipette tips, microcentrifuge tubes, and reagents should be RNase-free. All the reagents used in the RNA isolation step are included in the miRNeasy FFPE Kit.\nTransfer the sorted cells to a 2 mL round-bottom microcentrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the cell at 15,000 × g, 4°C for 3 min using a pre-chilled centrifuge 5427R or equivalent.\nPipette away the supernatant. For 100K fSCs input, you will observe a small white pellet near the bottom of the tube. Do not disturb the pellet.\nNote: If desire, the procedure can be stopped here. Snap freeze the cell pellet using liquid N2. Store the cell pellet at −80°C.\nAdd 100 μL buffer PKD. Mix by pipetting up and down.\nAdd 10 μL proteinase K. Mix by pipetting up and down.\nIncubate at 56°C for 1 h.\nCool down the tubes on ice. Then centrifuge at 20,000 × g, 20°C–25°C (room temperature in lab, RT) for 20 min.\nTransfer the supernatant to a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 10 μL DNase Booster Buffer and 10 μL DNase I stock solution. Mix by pipetting up and down.\nIncubate at RT for 15 min.\nAdd 320 μL buffer RBC. Mix by pipetting up and down.\nAdd 1120 μL ethanol (100%). Mix well by pipetting up and down 5 times.\nTransfer 700 μL sample to the RNeasy MinElute spin column.\nCentrifuge at 15,000 × g, 30 s at RT.",
    "Discard the flow-through.\nRepeat step 48–49 until all sample has passed through the column.\nAdd 500 μL buffer RPE to the column. Centrifuge at 15,000 × g, 30 s at RT.\nDiscard the flow-through.\nAdd 500 μL buffer RPE to the column. Centrifuge at 15,000 × g, 30 s at RT.\nDiscard the flow-through.\nPlace the column into a new 2 mL collection tube, open the lid of the spin column, and centrifuge at 15,000 × g for 5 min.\nPlace the column into a new 1.5 mL collection tube. Add 14 μL RNase-free water to the membrane of the column. Wait for 5 min. Close the lip during elution.\nCentrifuge at 15,000 × g for 1 min.\nDiscard the column. Keep the collection tube.\nTake 1 μL RNA for quantification using Qubit RNA HS Assay. Alternative RNA quantification method that is suitable for low input can be used.\nNote: Store the RNA at −80°C. The isolated RNA is now compatible for traditional cDNA generation methods such as the SMART-seq 2 protocol."
