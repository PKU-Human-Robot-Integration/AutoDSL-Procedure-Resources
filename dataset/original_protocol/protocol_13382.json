    "The following protocol has been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Wayne State University. The protocol here describes steps for utilizing rodent experimental subjects, but can be adapted for use in other model organisms.\n1. Preparation\nObtain the experimental subject and allow it to acclimate to the lab.\nPrepare 250 mL of perfusion solution and 250 mL of modified Tyrode's solution (Table 1), by oxygenating each to 10-20 ppm of O2, with pH 7.3.\nPrepare a 5 mL syringe with a cannula attached. Fill the syringe with perfusion solution. Use cannulas that are 23 G for a mouse, and 18 or 16 G for a small or large rat, respectively. Slide a 1 mm length of polyethylene (PE) tubing on the end of a blunted needle (Table of Materials), to help prevent the aorta from slipping off the cannula after being tied.\nComplete preparation of the dissection and cannulation area (Figure 1)\n\t\nFill two clean weigh boats at least halfway with perfusion solution. Submerge the tip of the cannula in perfusion solution with at least one double-looped suture placed around the cannula. Hold the syringe in place with a bar clamp.\nPlace surgical scissors, a hemostat, iris forceps, a pair of small curved scissors, and two #3 forceps for easy access.\nPrepare the experimental system (Figure 2) by priming and circulating the modified Tyrode's solution throughout the experimental system. Ensure that the chamber is completely full and stable.\nTurn on all data acquisition boxes, including the force transducer, the length motor, the pacing system, the temperature control system, and the data acquisition computer.\nCopy and rename a template folder containing the required *.dap and pointer files to reference the current experiment. Open the data acquisition software.",
    "Prepare the trabecula isolation tools (Vannas scissors, #5 or #55 forceps, glass probe) by submerging their tips in 10% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in ultrapure water or perfusion solution, to coat the metal with protein (Figure 2B).\n\t​NOTE: The entire experimental system must be prepared prior to dissection.\n2. Gross dissection and cannulation\nRecord the identification, body weight, and other relevant information of the animal subject.\nOptionally, inject 1,000 U/kg of heparin in sterile saline to the rodent via intraperitoneal injection at least 10 min prior to euthanasia, to minimize risks of clotting before coronary perfusion.\nPlace the animal in an induction chamber and induce general anesthesia using 3%-5% isoflurane vaporized in 100% oxygen, according to standard procedure.\n\tNOTE: Turn on any external scavengers, down draft tables, or fume hoods used to minimize exposure to isoflurane.\nOnce the rodent loses its righting reflex and the breathing rate has slowed:\n\t\n(For a rat) remove the animal from the induction chamber and place it supine on a dissection pad, with continued anesthesia through a nose cone.\n(For a mouse) perform cervical dislocation immediately after removing the animal from the induction chamber. The nose cone is not necessary. Turn the isoflurane vaporizer to 0%.\nIf needed, affix the upper limbs of the rodent to the dissection pad away from the chest wall using tape supported by pins, taking care not to pierce into the animal. Check for proper anesthesia depth (lack of toe-pinch response) prior to proceeding to the dissection.\nUsing surgical scissors (Mayo for rats, Metzenbaum for mice), just below the xyphoid process, cut the skin transverse across the full width of the rodent's abdomen into the peritoneal space.",
    "Using surgical scissors, make two vertical cuts parasagittal (up the sides of the chest wall) on both the left and right sides of the chest wall from the transverse cut. Then, cut across the diaphragm, connecting the parasagittal cuts, and freeing the thoracic space.\nClamp and lift the xyphoid process using a hemostat toward the rodent's head, to move the sternum and chest wall up toward the rodent's head, exposing the thoracic space and the heart. If needed, quickly extend the parasagittal cuts to near the second vertebral space, to fully expose the heart and/or break the pericardial membrane.\nUsing curved iris forceps, carefully lift the heart to visualize the great vessels. Place the forceps between the myocardium and the spine of the rodent, clamp down on the greater vessels, and lift the heart, taking care not to clamp the atria or ventricular segments.\n\t\nWhile slightly lifting the heart, quickly place the curved iris scissors (concave up) between the curved iris forceps and the spine of the rodent, and cut the great vessels and lungs away from the heart. Quickly move the heart into a weigh boat or beaker containing fresh perfusion solution, and shake to help clear blood off of the heart. \nTurn the isoflurane vaporizer to 0%, if not already done. If large segments of lung, pericardial, or other tissues remain attached to the heart, carefully cut away and discard them at this time to minimize interference with the cannulation.\nUsing the curved iris forceps, move the heart into a clean weigh boat or beaker, with the prepared cannula submerged. Cannulate the aorta, secure the aorta by tightening the looped silk suture, and flush with up to 5 mL of perfusion solution.",
    "Remove the heart from the cannula and place it in a silicone elastomer-coated weigh dish to prepare for trabecula isolation.\n3. Isolation and equilibration of trabecula\nPlace the heart in the silicone elastomer-coated dish under a stereomicroscope and illuminate it.\nLocate the right ventricular outflow tract. Pin the left atrium and the ventricular apex to the silicone elastomer in the dish.\nUsing long Vannas scissors, cut from the right ventricular outflow tract to the apex along the septum. Cut from the right ventricular outflow tract to the right atrium near the aorta, then cut through the right atrium (Figure 3B).\nUsing forceps, carefully pull open the right ventricular (RV) free wall from the outflow tract, being careful not to stretch the tissue.\n\tNOTE: Experimenters may find thin, white connective tissue strands, which can be cut without concern. Larger, pink (tissue) colored strands should be evaluated with care, as they may be trabeculae that can be isolated.\nPin the free wall of the right ventricle triangle to the dish, to expose the right ventricle (Figure 3C).\nUsing a glass pipette that has been melted and formed with a thin (<500 µm diameter) but not sharp end, search the exposed endocardium for free-standing trabeculae (Figure 3C).\n\tNOTE: A free-standing trabecula is a strip of muscle that one can fully probe underneath. Use trabeculae that have parallel sides (constant width), avoiding triangular papillary muscles. Be careful during this process and subsequent dissection, as applying strain on the trabecula can cause damage, reducing the developed force.",
    "Dissect the trabecula using small Vannas scissors. Leave a ≥1 mm cubed piece of tissue at each end of the trabecula to allow for attachment. Do not stretch the trabecula where possible, and minimize contact of metal tools, as both can also cause damage to the muscle. Relocate the pins holding the heart as needed to minimize strain on the muscle near the trabeculae identified.\nCut ~2 inches off the end of a 7 mL transfer pipette, slowly draw the trabecula into the pipette, and transfer it into a new weigh dish containing 50% perfusion solution and 50% modified Tyrode's solution. Allow the muscle to equilibrate to the increase in extracellular calcium within the mixed solution for several minutes.\n\t\nRepeat steps 3.7-3.8 to dissect additional trabecula at this time, to obtain additional trabecula as backup.\nTurn off the pump supplying superfusion and/or suction to the experimental chamber. Using the large bore transfer pipette, move the trabecula into the experimental chamber filled with Tyrode's solution.\nPin one >1 mm cube piece of tissue at the end of the trabecula to a hook on the force transducer, then pin the second cube to the motor.\n\tNOTE: Separate the motor and force transducer when mounting the first side for better access to the transducer, then move the hooks as close together as possible when mounting the second cube of tissue while the trabecula remains slack.\nRestart superfusion and begin pacing the muscle to determine the threshold voltage. Pace at 20% above the threshold voltage for approximately 1 h to allow the trabecula to equilibrate.",
    "At the end of this equilibrium period, slowly stretch the muscle using the micrometer connected to the motor until optimal developed stress generation is achieved, by observing the developed (minimum to peak) tension. Stop increasing the muscle length when the passive diastolic tension rises faster than the peak tension, indicating the optimal length has been passed.\nTurn off the transmitted microscope illumination, and illuminate the trabecula using a gooseneck illuminator at a steep angle. Using a camera connected through the microscope optics that has previously been calibrated, capture an image of the trabecula during diastole into the experimental folder. If the trabecula is wider than the camera's field of view, take multiple images across the muscle.\nOpen the image(s) in an imaging software that reports pixel distances.\n\t\nMeasure the pixels distance of the muscle diameter four times along its length. Measure the muscle (trabecula) length in pixels, excluding the large cube of tissue.\nIf the muscle length is longer than the field of view, use reference points along the muscle to measure the entire length.\nUsing the template in the experimental folder, average the diameter measures, and convert the diameter and lengths from pixels to mm using a previously obtained calibration. Calculate the cross-sectional area as π*diameter2/4 in mm2, and the muscle length in µm.\n4. Data acquisition\nOnce the muscle is equilibrated, open the data acquisition software, select Experiments | Length Control, and enter the calibrated trabecula length (FL) and cross-sectional area (area [m2]) in the Calibration box.\nFrom the template folder (Step 1.7), ensure that the freeform_file.txt points to the correct folder, and open the freeform.dap file in a text editor. Set the isotonic level (isoton) to 32,000 in the *.dap file.",
    "In the Length Control box, select the Freeform tab and browse to the appropriate Freeform list file. Ensure the Data Filing path is also the correct folder to save data. Begin acquiring data from fully isometric twitches by pressing Run Experiment, before acquiring load-clamp data using a feedback control with proportional and integration gain parameters.\nAcquire load-clamped data by defining the afterload (isoton) in the *.dap file, and iterate values of proportional gain (propgain) and integration (Ki) parameters by saving the file in the text editor. Press Run Experiment in the data acquisition software interface.\n\t\nEnsure that the clamp includes relengthening back to its original length (sometimes referred to as relaxation loading5) during this iteration to attain the maximal range of strain rates, by setting mode (flswitch) from one and increasing the threshold for ending the load-clamp (flthreshold) from zero.\nControl the end of the load-clamp by changing the mode (flswitch) from one to zero. Repeat the acquisition while changing the end of the load-clamp from zero relengthening to complete relengthening back to the starting length.\n\t\nTo increase the length, incrementally increase the threshold for ending the load-clamp (flthreshold) from zero until the muscle nearly relengthens back to its original length.\nReset the mode (flswitch = 1) and threshold (flthreshold = 0), and run one final data acquisition.\nIf desired, modify the afterload in the study by repeating steps 4.4-4.6. This acquisition may be done immediately.\nIf desired, modify the preload by stretching or shortening the muscle, or treat the muscle by adding compounds to the Tyrode's solution. If altering the preload or adding compounds, wait a minimum of 20 min to ensure that the slow-force response9,15 has stabilized and/or for the compound to fully penetrate the muscle.",
    "Once the data acquisition is completed, remove the trabecula. If needed, freeze or fix the trabecula for biochemical or histological analysis.\nClean the work areas and experimental system, flush all tubing with water, and turn off all components.\n5. Data analysis\nOpen the data files using a quantitative analysis program by directing the program to the appropriate file path.\nQuantify relaxation by ensuring that the data analysis program analyzes the clamped beat, and that the program correctly acquires the start of the load-clamp.\n\t\nEnsure that the end of the load-clamp is identified, so that the relaxation rate (1/τ) is quantified from the peak negative derivative of stress during an isometric relaxation.\nUse the Glantz method16 to determine this exponential time constant, or other appropriate quantification of relaxation (minimum derivative of stress, logistic time constant17, or kinematic model18).\nEnsure that the data analysis program calculates the strain rate by taking the time derivative of the strain, where strain is calculated as the length as a function of time divided by length at optimal contraction.\nRepeat the above steps for all traces of a given condition.\nPlot the relationship between the relaxation rate and strain rate, limiting the maximum data to a physiological strain rate of less than 1 s-1. Exclude data at low strain rates (Figure 4C), as the relaxation phase may not reflect the exponential decay17,18.\nObtain the slope of the line between the relaxation rate and the strain rate, and record the slope as the index of MCR.\nRepeat the above analysis for each condition interrogated."
