Schematic overview of the general steps involved in the\n          enrichment of neutrophils from fresh whole blood samples\n        \n        To begin, if the anticoagulant in the vacutainer is not EDTA, add 1 μL\n        of 0.5 M EDTA to the whole blood.\n      \n        Prepare the following solutions (see “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]”):\n        \n1× PBS+EDTA.\nTCL+2-mercaptoethanol lysis buffer.\n        For each individual sample, gently open the vacutainer tube and move\n        500 μL of whole blood to a 15 mL conical tube.\n      \n        Add 8 mL of ACK lysis buffer to each tube using a 10 mL serological\n        pipet, pipetting up and down 5 times to mix the sample and lyse the\n        RBCs.\n      \n        Centrifuge the samples at 300 × g for 5 min at 25°C with max\n        acceleration and max deceleration.\n      \n        Aspirate the supernatant, being careful not to disturb the pellet.\n        \nThe pellet contains the neutrophils and all other PMBCs.\n        Resuspend the pellet of cells in 250 μL of 25°C 1× PBS+EDTA by pipetting\n        up and down gently 5 times.\n      \nNeutrophil enrichment\nTiming: 40–60 min\n    \n      Once most RBCs have been removed and the pellet is resuspended, enrichment\n      for neutrophils via EasySep isolation can be performed (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\n    \nVortex EasySep™ RapidSpheres™ for 30 s.\nAdd 50 μL of EasySep™ Isolation Cocktail to each sample.\nAdd 50 μL of RapidSpheres to each sample.\nMix gently by pipetting up and down 10 times.\nIncubate samples for 5 min at 25°C.\nTop up the volume of each tube to 4 mL with 1× PBS+EDTA.\nCap all of the 15 mL conical tubes tightly.",
    "Mix gently by tilting the samples back and forth 5 times.\nRemove the lid from each 15 mL conical tube.\n        Place samples in the EasyEights™ EasySep™ Magnet, ensuring that all\n        tubes sit all the way down.\n      \nIncubate samples on the magnet for 5 min at 25°C.\n        Use a 5 mL serological pipet to transfer the supernatant of the samples\n        into a new set of labeled 15 mL conical tubes.\n        \nDiscard tubes containing the RapidSpheres.\nNote: Angle the pipet such that the tip is\n      opposite the magnet to avoid touching the magnetic beads. The procedure is\n      a negative selection, meaning that neutrophils remain in the supernatant\n      while PBMCs are captured by the RapidSpheres.\n    \n        Add 25 μL of RapidSpheres to the tubes containing the supernatant from\n        the first selection step.\n      \n        Cap samples tightly and mix gently by tilting the samples back and forth\n        5 times.\n      \nIncubate samples for 5 min at 25°C.\n        Following the incubation, place tubes on the EasySep magnet and incubate\n        for 5 min.\n      \n        Use a 5 mL serological pipet to transfer the supernatant of the samples\n        into a new set of labeled 15 mL conical tubes.\n        \nDiscard tubes containing the RapidSpheres pellet.\n        Place the samples (supernatant) back on the EasySep magnet and incubate\n        for 5 min.\n      \nNote: This additional incubation on the\n      magnet is necessary in order to pull any remaining RapidSpheres from the\n      suspension.\n    \n        Use a 5 mL serological pipet to carefully transfer 3.5 mL of the\n        supernatant of the samples into a new set of labeled 15 mL conical\n        tubes.\n        \nDiscard tubes containing the RapidSpheres pellet.\n        Cap all samples and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 25°C.\n      \n        Aspirate the supernatant, being careful not to disturb the pellet.\n      \nNote: The cell pellet should now be highly\n      enriched for neutrophils with minimal other cell species present.",
    "Resuspend the isolated neutrophils in 1 mL 1× PBS + EDTA.\nMix thoroughly by pipetting up and down.\nCell counting and lysis\nTiming: 5–20 min\n      Once isolated, neutrophils should be counted in order to determine the\n      yield and to determine the correct volume of lysis buffer to use so that\n      all samples are at the same concentration for bulk RNA sequencing library\n      preparation.\n    \n        Mix 10 μL of neutrophil suspension with 10 μL of trypan blue by\n        pipetting.\n      \nAdd 10 μL to a counting chamber of a hemocytometer.\n        Using a hemocytometer or an automated cell counter, determine the total\n        number of neutrophils isolated from each sample.\n      \nNote: if an automated cell counter is\n      used, be sure to adjust the detection gates to count only the smaller\n      population of cells. Larger leukocytes may still be present at low levels\n      in the sample, and the goal is to determine the neutrophil count, not the\n      absolute cell count of each sample.\n    \n        Move 2 × 105 cells to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube by transferring\n        an appropriate volume of the cell suspension based on the determined\n        count/concentration.\n      \n        Top up the tube of cells to 1.5 mL total volume by adding additional 1×\n        PBS+EDTA.\n      \nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 25°C.\n        Aspirate the supernatant, being careful not to disturb the pellet.\n        \nRemove the last bit of supernatant with a 20–200 μL pipette.\n        Resuspend the neutrophils in 200 μL of the prepared TCL + 1%\n        2-mercaptoethanol lysis buffer.\n        \n            If a lower number of cells than desired were retrieved, resuspend\n            the cells in a lower volume such that the final lysis concentration\n            is 1,000 cells/μL.\n          \nMix well to fully lyse all cells.\n        Transfer 100 μL per tube to two labeled cryopreservation tubes.\n        \nPlace tubes on dry ice immediately.",
    "After 5 min, the aliquoted lysates can be moved to storage at −80°C.\n      \nOptional: If enough of the original\n      sample remains, it may be helpful to check for successful enrichment by\n      flow cytometry, comparing the unenriched whole blood to the enriched\n      neutrophil product. A suggested antibody panel for discriminating between\n      the various PBMCs and neutrophils is suggested in LaSalle et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\n      and includes CD3, CD14, CD16, CD19, CD20, CD56, CD66b.\n    \nModified Smart-Seq2 cDNA generation\nTiming: 6–8 h\n      Once neutrophils have been enriched, cDNA can now be prepared via a\n      modified version of the Smart-Seq2 protocol11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] and\n      then used for downstream library preparation. These steps involve\n      purifying RNA from the lysed cells, reverse transcription of mRNA\n      transcripts to cDNA, whole-transcriptome amplification, and purification\n      of amplified cDNA.\n    \n        Prepare neutrophil samples for cDNA generation.\n        \nBring RNA-SPRI beads to 25°C.\nThaw lysed neutrophils on ice.\n            Pipette 20 μL (at a concentration of 1,000 cells/μL) of each\n            neutrophil lysis sample into the well of a 96-well plate on ice.\n          \nCentrifuge plates at 1,500 rpm for 30 s at 4°C.\nPlace plate(s) back on ice.\n            Cover with the lid of a pipette tip box, until beginning the\n            following step.\n          \n        Prepare RNA-SPRI beads.\n        \nVortex the beads for 30 s.\n            Use a serological pipet to transfer the necessary volume (44 μL per\n            sample, plus excess) into a reagent reservoir.\n          \n        Using a multichannel pipette, add 44 μL of RNA-SPRI beads (2.2 times the\n        sample volume) to samples.\n      \nMix thoroughly by pipetting up and down.\n        Cover the plate(s), then incubate for 10 min at 25°C.\n        \n            During this incubation, prepare 50 mL of 80% EtOH: 40 mL EtOH and\n            10 mL ddH2O.\n          \n            Also prepare the appropriate volume of Smart-Seq2 Mix-1 (see\n            “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]”),\n            plus excess (10%), and set aside on ice.",
    "Following the incubation, place the plate on the DynaMag™-96 Side\n        Skirted Magnet and incubate for 5 min at 25°C.\n      \n        Remove the supernatant.\n        \n            Aspirate the liquid by angling the tips of the pipette opposite to\n            the beads.\n          \nCritical: Do not disturb the beads.\n      RNA from the neutrophils is bound to them, and any loss of beads at this\n      step will result in loss of genetic material input for subsequent steps.\n    \n        Use a serological pipet to fill a reagent reservoir with 80% EtOH.\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2496-Fig3.jpg\n              Figure 3. Smart-Seq2 cDNA generation bead washing\n            \n              (A–C) As the 96-well plate is moved side to side on the\n              side-skirted plate magnet as depicted in A–C, note how the pellets\n              of beads move from the right side of the well to the left, and\n              then back to the right. This movement of the beads through the\n              ethanol allows for superior removal of non-nucleic acids and\n              better retrieval of RNA.\n            \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2496-Fig4.jpg\n              Figure 4. Appropriate way to cover SPRI beads during drying\n            \n              The lid must be slightly skewed in order to increase airflow. If\n              the plate is covered too tightly, the beads will dry unevenly and\n              take too long, enabling RNA degradation.\n            \n        Wash the beads in 100 μL of 80% EtOH twice.\n        \nAdd the EtOH, ensuring the beads are covered.\n            Agitate the beads, moving the plate side to side on the magnet such\n            that the beads move from one side of the well to the other side (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\n            \nNote: Make sure to move in both\n              directions so that samples in columns A and H are washed properly.\n            \n            Place the plate on the magnet and incubate for 30–60 s to allow all\n            beads to come out of solution.\n          \nUse a P200 pipette to remove the ethanol.\nRepeat steps a-d (total 2 washes).",
