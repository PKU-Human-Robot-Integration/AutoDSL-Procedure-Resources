    "Note: The Canton-S strain is the standard wild-type background line obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center.\n1. Food Preparation and Recipe for 1,000 ml of Food\nNote: This section describes the protocol for food preparation. Large metal pots are used to prepare about 18 L of food at a time. The protocol described here is downsized and uses 1,000 ml H2O. Food is autoclaved twice.\nMix 113 g sucrose and 28 g brewers yeast in 643 ml water. Leave ingredients on a hot plate set at 25 °C with a stir bar to mix throughout for 15 minutes.\nAutoclave food solution for 20 min.\nMix 49 g cornmeal and 8.1 g agar in 268 ml water and add to the autoclaved food mixture described in step 1.2. Mix well with a large spoon or a whisk.\nAutoclave food mixture for another 20 min.\nPlace the food on a plate and let cool down with constant mixing with a stir bar. If additional solutions should be added to food, such as mifepristone (RU486), keep the food on a hot plate set up at 60 °C and add solution when the food reaches the required temperature.\nDissolve 2.4 g tegosept in 10.7 ml 100% EtOH and keep on a cold plate with a stirrer to completely dissolve and mix for about 15 min.\nAdd tegosept solution to food when the temperature of food is 60 °C and mix well.\nUse a pump or a food dispenser to pour about 10 ml of food into a wide vial. By using a food dispenser one can pour food simultaneously into 100 wide, plastic vials (1 tray) at a time.",
    "Cover the vials with Kimwipes and cheese cloth and leave food at room temperature for 12-24 hr to cool down. Keep the food at 4 °C and use within 3-4 weeks. Warm up the food to room temperature before use for fly work.\n2. Preparation of Glass Vials\nPrepare food according to the protocol listed in step 1.\nAliquot 5 ml of food into each narrow, glass vial, which is the correct size for the population monitors. This amount of food should be low enough to be below the lowest ring of the population monitor.\nAfter the food cools down to room temperature cover the vials with sponge plugs and keep them at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks. Because the amount of food in a vial is rather low, it is best to use the food within a week or two to prevent any drying.\nWarm up the vials to room temperature before use.\n3. Maintenance of the Parental Flies\nGrow the flies in wide plastic vials with standard laboratory food and keep the vials in a humidified, temperature-controlled environmental chamber at 25 °C on a 12 hr light/dark cycle. The daylight period starts at 6:00 AM in this laboratory.\nIn the morning clear adult flies from the vials from which parental flies will be collected.\nCollect newly eclosed flies and separate them by gender on a CO2 pad within 8 hr after eclosion to make sure that the female flies are virgins. Flies start to mate 8 hr after eclosion.\nWhen the virgin male and female flies are between 5 and 10 days of age, put 10 males and 10 female flies in a vial with standard food and several grains of active yeast on top.",
    "Note: Control the density of the larvae by using the same number of flies and keeping them in a vial for two days. Addition of active yeast promotes egg production.\nKeep the flies to mate and lay eggs in a temperature-controlled environmental chamber at 25 °C with a 12 hr light/dark cycle for 2 days. Set up 5-10 vials of parental flies.\nPass the flies to a new plastic vial every other day and keep the vials with the eggs in an incubator at 25 °C.\n4. Collection of Experimental Flies\nAfter 9 days flies will start to eclose from the vials where the parental flies laid eggs (described in step 3.6.). Clear and discard the flies that eclosed during the first day and return the vials to incubator. Most of the flies eclosed on day 1 are females. A more synchronized population of flies will eclose on day 2.\nWithin 24 hr place newly eclosed flies on CO2 pads and collect 25 male and 25 female flies per vials with a paintbrush or metal spoon. Keep flies on CO2 pads for a short period of time to minimize any effects of CO2. Write down the day of eclosion on the vial. Assemble at least 5 replicate vials for experimental and for control groups.\nKeep the vials in temperature-controlled environmental chambers at 25 °C with a 12 hr light/dark cycle.\nPass the flies to a new plastic vial every other day using a funnel.\nAge the flies until the desired age for experimentation is reached.\n5. Setting Up the Mobility Monitors\nPlace the population monitors in a temperature-controlled incubator.",
    "Connect each monitor with a 4-wire telephone cable to the Power Supply Interface Unit (PSIU) via 5-way splitters (multi-line), which can connect up to 5 individual monitors to one opening in the PSIU. See Figures 1A and 2B.\nConnect the PSIU to a line power outlet (100-240 V). Plug the power supply output connector into one of the 2 mating PSIU jacks. The adjacent green light illuminates green when connected properly.\nConnect the PSIU to the Universal Serial Bus (USB) hardware. Connect the USB cable between the USB hardware with a Macintosh or a Windows PC for data recording. It would be best to have a computer dedicated only for data collection since collection runs for days at a time.\nDownload the USB software (PSIUdrivers.zip). USB driver software is used by the Power Supply interface and needs to be downloaded only once. It synthesizes a data link between the computer program and the PSIU/activity monitors. For a PC use a COM port and for a Macintosh use a simple serial port.\nDownload the computer program for Macintosh OSX (Intel) or for Windows PC (XP/Vista/7) programs by following instructions provided by manufacturer Notes 308.pdf.\nStart the computer program and set up the program by clicking on the Preferences, Lights or Monitors. The program will run until the user selects “quit” to stop the program. If the computer program or the computer is shut down the monitors will continue to count beam interruptions, but the counts will not be recorded until the program is re-launched. In that case the first reading will include all the counts since the last time the PSIU sent the data to computer.\nSelect the Preferences tab and choose the Serial Port, PSIU for Macintosh and COM for the PC.",
    "Select the reading interval that ranges from seconds, minutes, or an hour.\nSelect the monitors: Each monitor has its unique number that is given by the manufacturer. Select the Monitor Range that corresponds to the numbers given to the monitors by the manufacturer.\nThe Lights box: Make sure that all the monitors are properly connected, which is marked by a green light next to the monitor number on the software. A red light indicates that the connection is lost, and a black box indicates that the system is off or improperly set up.\n6. Setting Up the Experiment\nRemove glass vials containing food from 4 °C and let them warm to room temperature.\nSeparate male and female flies of the same age on CO2 pad. For aging studies it is possible to start mobility studies as early as 3 days of age.\nPut 10 male or 10 female flies into each glass vial containing food. Use at least three vials for each experimental and control line of flies and for each gender.\nKeep the vials on their side until the flies recover from CO2 to ensure the flies do not get stuck in the food. Separate flies at about 8:00 AM and leave them for about 2 hr at room temperature to recover from CO2.\nPlace the vials inside the population monitors housed in the incubators.\nDiscard the data collected within the first 24 hr after the flies are put into the incubator to let them adjust to the novel environment.",
    "Pass the flies after 3 or 4 days to new vials to avoid drying of the food. If flies are prone to death or are age 40 days or older, pass the flies after 2 days and use data collected for day 2. Also, use more than three vials per group to ensure adequate replicates. Data from vials with dead flies should be disregarded and not included in analysis.\n7. Running the Activity Monitors and Calculating the Total Spontaneous Activity\nSelect preferences - the interval for data collection.\n\tNote: The computer program allows collection of the data at intervals ranging from 1 second to 60 minutes. 10 and 30 minute periods have been found to provide adequate information about mobility without having an overwhelming number of time points. At the selected time period, the program will send the current total count for each monitor to the computer and start counting again from zero. The computer program stores the data in a new folder created by the computer data system. The data collected in each monitor are stored separately, and individual text documents are created for each vial. The data are continuously collected as long as the program operates.\nAt the end of the experiment, scan the data using the FileScan110X for Macintosh OSX (Intel) or SystemMB108 for Windows PC (XP/Vista/7) program.\n\tNote: The Scan program eliminates duplicate readings and makes sure that the recordings are complete.\nSave the data collected within a specific time and period of days. Choose an experimental name and copy the files from the computer data folder for analysis.\n\tNote: At this time, activity intervals can be changed and converted to different ones. The original data will stay stored in the computer data folder and can be retrieved as long as they are not deleted.",
    "8. Data Analysis\nCopy the data collected in the text files into columns of Excel spreadsheets for data analysis. Data collected by this software are in columns, which contain numbers representing total activity in a single monitor over a period of time selected by the investigator.\n\tNote: Data collected for each monitor are in separate text files. There are 32 columns for each monitor. The first six columns are empty and contain only 0; next three contain the data collected at the bottom ring, in the middle, and at the top ring. The rest of the channels can be deleted since they do not contain any data. Each ring outputs a single value per time. See screen shot of the raw data in Figure 2.\nCalculate the total activity within a desired period of time for each monitor that represents the sum of activity collected at three different heights of infrared beams.\n\tNote: The time period can range from several hours, 24 hours or several days.\nDetermine the average locomotor activity and the standard deviation between the 3 monitors that represent 3 biological replicates.\n\tNote: The data can be analyzed for statistical significance by using a number of tests. A two-tailed Students’s t-test, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a Tukey HSD post-hoc test could be used to determine the effects of several environmental or genetic manipulations on 24 hours of spontaneous locomotor activity16. There are a number of other programs that can be used and have been previously published17.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
