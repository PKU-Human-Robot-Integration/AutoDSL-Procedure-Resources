    "All work involving animals was performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the College of William and Mary.\n1. Animal Care and Embryo Handling\nInduce natural mating by administering a subcutaneous injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) into the dorsal lymph sac of adult Xenopus laevis at a dose of 600 U for females and 400 U for males.\nAfter injection, place at least one male and one female frog in a room-temperature holding tank overnight. Egg laying typically begins 9-12 h after HCG administration.\nCollect embryos. Dejelly by gently washing with 2% cysteine (pH 8.0) for 2-4 min.\nRinse the embryos 3x in 0.1x Mark's Modified Ringer's solution (MMR) (100 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4, 2 mM CaCl2, 5 mM HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4–7.6).\nTransfer the embryos to 100 mm glass Petri dishes containing 0.1x MMR and 50 µg/mL gentamycin. A density of 50-100 embryos per plate is appropriate.\nIncubate the dishes at 14 °C–22°C and allow the embryos to develop until they reach the desired developmental stage(s). Periodically remove unfertilized cells and necrotic or abnormally developing embryos with a plastic transfer pipette.\n\tNOTE: To ensure consistency, developmental staging is performed according to morphological criteria defined by Nieuwkoop and Faber16. Stages of interest will vary based on experimental focus. For example, key neurodevelopmental landmarks are associated with Stage 14 (onset of neurulation), Stage 18 (onset of neural tube closure), and Stage 22 (onset of tailbud elongation).\n2. Embryo Dissection and Sample Preparation\nSolution preparation",
    "Prepare 2 mM Ca2+ solution containing 116 mM NaCl, 0.67 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2·2H2O, 1.31 mM MgSO4, and 4.6 mM Tris. For every 100 mL solution, add 1 mL of penicillin/streptomycin (10,000 U/mL penicillin; 10,000 µg/mL streptomycin). Adjust pH to 7.8 and filter-sterilize.\nPrepare calcium- and magnesium-free (CMF) solution by combining 116 mM NaCl, 0.67 mM KCl, 4.6 mM Tris and 0.4 mM EDTA. Adjust pH to 7.8 and autoclave to sterilize. For every 100 mL solution, add 1 mL of penicillin/streptomycin (10,000 U/mL penicillin; 10,000 µg/mL streptomycin). Adjust pH to 7.8 and filter-sterilize.\nPreparation of plates for dissection and imaging\nUV-sterilize two 35 mm plastic Petri dishes and one 35 mm Cell Culture Dish (see Table of Materials).\nWhile working in a laminar flow hood, prepare two 50 mL plastic conical tubes containing 10 mL of 2 mM Ca2+ solution each.\nRemain working in the laminar flow hood and add 2 mL of 2 mM Ca2+ solution to one 35 mm plastic Petri dish, 2 mL of 2 mM Ca2+ solution to one 35 mm Cell Culture Dish, and 2 mL of CMF solution to one 35 mm plastic Petri dish.\nOutside of the laminar flow hood, fill two 100 mm plastic Petri dishes and one 35 mm plastic Petri dish with 0.1x MMR with gentamycin (50 µg/mL). Fill a 60 mm plastic Petri dish with 70% ethanol.\nImmediately before dissection, add 0.01 g of Collagenase B to one of the 50 mL tubes containing Ca2+ solution. Mix well and transfer the solution to a fresh 60 mm plastic Petri dish.",
    "With the help of a dissecting microscope, identify embryos of the desired developmental stage. Use a sterile transfer pipette to transfer at least six appropriate embryos to one of the 100 mm plates containing 0.1x MMR + gentamycin prepared in step 2.2.4. This will serve as the holding plate.\nUse a sterile transfer pipette to transfer one embryo to the second 100 mm plate containing 0.1x MMR + gentamycin. This will serve as the dissection plate.\n\t\nIf dissecting embryos old enough to move (approximately stage 23 or older), anesthetize each embryo prior to dissection by transferring it to a dish containing 0.1% 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester diluted in 0.1x MMR with gentamycin (50 µg/mL). Once the embryo is immobilized, transfer it back to the dish containing 0.1x MMR with gentamycin (50 µg/mL) and continue with the dissection.\nCarefully remove the vitelline membrane that surrounds the embryo. This can most easily be done by using a pair of blunt forceps to stabilize the embryo while using a pair of fine forceps to grasp the membrane. Carefully pull with the fine forceps to peel the vitelline membrane apart.\nUse fine forceps to separate the dorsal and ventral regions of the embryo. This can be done by using the forceps to 'pinch' the embryo along the anterior-posterior axis, cutting it in half. With a sterile transfer pipette, transfer the dorsal portion to the 60 mm plate with collagenase solution prepared in step 2.2.5. Discard the ventral portion.\nAllow the dorsal explant to incubate in the collagenase solution for 1–2 min at room temperature. Gently transfer it back to the dissection plate.",
    "Complete the dissection by carefully removing all residual endodermal and mesodermal contamination from the presumptive neural tissue of the ectoderm. For embryos at Stage 22 or older, the neural tube should also be removed and discarded.\n\tNOTE: If necessary during the dissection, the dish of 70% ethanol prepared in step 2.2.4 can be used to clear or re-sterilize the forceps.\nOnce the dissection is complete, gently transfer the explant to the 35 mm plate of Ca2+ solution prepared in step 2.2.3.\nRepeat steps 2.4-2.9 until four explants have been collected.\nUse a P1000 micropipette to transfer all four explants to the 35 mm plate containing CMF solution, taking care to avoid any contact between the explants and the air-water interface. Gently swirl the dish so that all of the explants cluster in the center of the plate.\nIncubate 1 h at room temperature to allow explants to dissociate.\n\tNOTE: To aid in dissociation, 0.025%–0.01% trypsin can be added to the CMF solution. This may be necessary for efficient dissociation of older embryos (Stage 22 and older).\nAt this point, at least two appropriately staged embryos should remain on the holding plate. Transfer these embryos to a fresh dish filled with 0.1x MMR with gentamycin prepared in step 2.2.4 and allow them to develop undisturbed with the dish covered to match the explant dish. These embryos will serve as sibling controls.\nUse superglue to attach a micro-ruled coverslip (see Table of Materials) to the bottom of the 35 mm Cell Culture Dish prepared in step 2.2.3.",
    "NOTE: Place small dabs of superglue around the edges of the coverslip, then press it firmly against the underside of the Cell Culture Dish. The positional markings will be obscured anywhere the glue contacts the grid, so it is important to keep the central gridded portion of the coverslip free from adhesive.\nAfter the explants have dissociated for 1 h, use a P100 micropipette to transfer them to the Cell Culture Dish. In order to plate as many cells as possible on the gridded portion of the dish, hold the pipette at a shallow angle close to the surface of the dish, position the pipette tip in the corner of the grid facing inwards, and firmly expel the cell suspension across the gridded area. Ideally, cells will settle in a tight dense cluster.\nIncubate for 1 h at room temperature to allow cells to adhere to the plate. Determine and record the developmental stage of the sibling control embryos when this incubation begins.\nCombine 5 µL 1 mM Fluo-4 AM (see Table of Materials) with 2 µL of 10% Pluronic F-127 acid.\n\tNOTE: Fluo-4 AM is light sensitive and should be kept in a light-safe or foil-covered tube at all times.\nAfter the incubation is complete, move the sample dish to a darkroom or other light-protected location. Use a micropipette to remove 100 µL of solution from the edge of the dish. Add this solution to the aliquot of Fluo-4 AM/Pluronic F-127 acid, pipette up and down to mix, and return the full volume to the sample dish. Swirl gently to mix.\nCover the plate with aluminum foil and allow to incubate for 1 h at room temperature. Determine and record the developmental stage of the sibling control embryos when this incubation begins.",
    "At the end of the incubation, use the remaining conical tube of 2 mM Ca2+ to perform three media washes in the following way: 1) remove 1 mL of solution from the dish, add 3 mL of fresh solution, 2) remove 3 mL of solution from the dish, add 3 mL of fresh solution, 3) remove 3 mL of solution from the dish, add 3 mL of fresh solution.\n3. Calcium Imaging\nNOTE: Calcium imaging was performed using an inverted confocal microscope (Table of Materials).\nPlace the sample plate on the microscope stage, taking care to protect it from ambient light exposure. Once the plate is secured, use a marker to label the front point of the plate so that the same field of view can be found in subsequent imaging.\nLocate the sample under the microscope — first at 10X and then at 20X magnification — and select an appropriate field of view for imaging. An ideal field of view is cell-dense, but not so dense that cells are clumped or difficult to distinguish individually.\nAdjust microscope focus so that the grid-ruled coverslip is visible. The numbers marked on the coverslip serve as unique identifiers for particular grid locus and can be used to locate the same field of view for additional imaging. If the originally selected field of view does not overlap with any numbers, readjust until an identifiable number is in frame.\nTake a bright-field image of the selected field of view with the grid-ruled coverslip in focus.\nAdjust the focus settings and take a bright-field image of the selected field of view with the cells in focus.",
    "With the cell layer in focus, illuminate the samples with a 488 nm laser. HV and Offset values can be optimized for each experiment to ensure that a dynamic range of fluorescence is detected on the FITC channel.\nFor a two-hour image, modify the imaging configuration to record 901 frames with a scan time of 3.93 s and an interval of 8 s. Run configuration to acquire image.\nOnce imaging is complete, remove the plate from the microscope stage. Remove 1 mL of solution from the plate and replace it with 1 mL of 2x MEMFA (200 mM MOPS, 2 mM EGTA, and 2 mM MgSO4 in 7.4% formaldehyde).\nIncubate the plate for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Determine and record the developmental stage of the sibling control embryos when this incubation begins.\nAfter fixation is complete, remove all solution from the plate and replace it with 2 mL of 1x PBS. Store plates at 4 °C for further processing.\n4. Gene Expression Analysis: Probe Synthesis\nAs described below, generate an antisense RNA probe for in situ hybridization. Additionally, generate a sense probe for the same gene for use as a negative control.\nIn order to purify plasmid DNA containing the probe template sequence, inoculate 150 mL of LB broth with bacterial glycerol stocks containing the template plasmid. Incubate at 37 °C with shaking overnight or until culture is turbid.\nPurify plasmid DNA from the bacterial culture using your method of choice.\n\tNOTE: We use the McNary-Nagel midi-prep kit to obtain high yields of plasmid DNA.\nTo confirm that the plasmid contains the expected insert, perform a restriction digest and analyze the products on an agarose gel. Uncut plasmid can also be analyzed on an agarose gel to check for genomic DNA contamination.",
    "To linearize the template DNA, set up a 100 µL restriction digest reaction containing 20 µg of plasmid DNA, 2 µL of appropriate restriction enzyme, and 1x appropriate buffer. Incubate at 37 °C for at least 2 h.\nExtract linearized DNA by performing a phenol/chloroform extraction followed by a chloroform extraction.\nPrecipitate DNA with 100% ethanol. This can be done quickly by adding two volumes of cold ethanol to the sample and incubating it at -80 °C until it solidifies (15-30 min).\nUse a refrigerated centrifuge to pellet DNA by spinning for 20 min at 12,000 x g/4 °C.\nRemove the supernatant and wash the pellet with 200 µL of 70% ethanol. Spin for 5 min at 12,000 x g/4 °C.\nRemove the supernatant and air-dry pellet for approximately 5 min. Resuspend in 20 µL of 1x TE and store at 4 °C until further use.\nTo synthesize and purify antisense RNA probe, create a 2.5 mM rNTP mix by combining 15 µL of 10 mM rCTP, 15 µL of 10 mM rGTP, 15 µL of 10 mM rATP, 9.75 µL of 10 mM rUTP, and 5.25 µL of 10 mM dig-11 UTP (See Table of Materials).\nSet up a 50 µL in vitro transcription reaction containing 4 µg of linearized template DNA from step 4.2-4.10, 15 µL of 2.5 mM rNTP mix from step 4.11, 10 µL of 5x transcription buffer, 5 µL of 0.1 M DTT, 0.5 µL of RNAse inhibitor (20 U/µL), and 1.5 µL of appropriate RNA polymerase (T3, T7, or SP6). Incubate 1 h at 37 °C.\nAdd an additional 1.5 µL of RNA polymerase to the reaction and return to 37 °C for an additional hour.",
    "Add 1 µL of RQ1 DNAse to reaction and incubate at 37 °C for 10 min to degrade DNA template.\nAdd 30 µL of 7.5 M LiCl solution to sample. Pipette to mix and incubate at -20 °C for at least 1 h.\nUsing a refrigerated centrifuge, spin the sample 25 min at 14,000 x g/4 °C.\nRemove the supernatant and rinse the pellet with 500 µL of 70% ethanol. Spin for 5 min at 14,000 x g/4 °C.\nRemove the supernatant and air-dry pellet for approximately 5 min. Resuspend in 20 µL of nuclease-free water.\nCreate at 10x probe stock by diluting the sample to a concentration of 10 ng/µL in Hybridization Buffer (50% formamide, 5x SSC (saline-sodium citrate; 750 mM NaCl, 75 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 1 mg/mL torula RNA, 0.1 % Tween-20, 1x Denhardt's Solution, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mM EDTA, and 100 µg/mL heparin). Store at -20 °C until further use.\n5. Gene Expression Analysis: Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization\nNOTE: All washes should be performed with approximately 1 mL of solution using a sterile, individually wrapped transfer pipette. The pipette should be positioned at the edge of the plate when removing or adding solution, and washes should be performed as gently as possible to ensure that cells are not dislodged from the plate surface and lost.\nRemove 1x PBS from plate (from step 3.10). Replace with fresh 1x PBS and incubate 5 min at room temperature.\nCombine 25 mL of 0.1 M triethanolamine (pH 8.0) with 62.5 µL of acetic anhydride. Mix well. Wash the plate with this solution for 10 min.\nWash the plate with 1x SSC for 5 min.\nWash the plate with 0.02 M HCl for 10 min to permeabilize cells.\nWash 2x with 1x PBS for 5 min each.",
    "Remove the solution and add 1 mL of Hybridization Buffer (50% formamide, 5x SSC (750 mM NaCl, 75 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 1 mg/mL torula RNA, 0.1% Tween-20, 1x Denhardt's Solution, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mM EDTA, and 100 µg/mL heparin) to plate. Incubate with shaking for at least 6 h at 60 °C.\nRemove Hybridization Buffer and replace with 750 µL of 1x RNA Probe solution (diluted form the 10x stock made in step 4.19. Sense RNA probes can be used as a negative control.\nIncubate with shaking for 8-14 h at 60 °C.\nRemove the probe and store at -20 °C.\n\tNOTE: 1x probe dilution can be reused up to three times before being discarded.\nRinse the plate with 0.2x SSC.\nWash with fresh 0.2x SSC for 1 h at 60 °C.\nMove the plates to room temperature and equilibrate for 5 min.\nWash the plate with 0.2x SSC for 5 min.\nWash the plate with 1x PBT for 15 min.\nWash the plate with 2% H2O2 in 1x PBT (0.1% Triton-x-100) for 1 h.\n\tNOTE: This solution is light-sensitive, so it should be made fresh for each experiment and shielded from light. Plates should also be shielded from light or foiled during this incubation.\nWash the plate with 1x TBST (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1%Tween-20) for 15 min.\nDilute Blocking Reagent to 2% in Maleic Acid Buffer (100 mM maleic acid, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5). Block the cells in this mixture for at least 1 h at room temperature.\nReplace blocking solution with anti-digoxygenin-POD antibody diluted 1:1,000 in 2% Blocking Reagent in Maleic Acid Buffer. Incubate overnight at 4 °C.\nRinse the plate 3x with 1x TBST.",
    "Wash 4x with 2mL of 1x TBST for at least 15 min per wash with continuous rocking.\nWash 2x with 1x PBT for at least 10 min per wash with continuous rocking.\nDilute Cy3-conjugated tyramide 1:25 in 1x PBT. Wash the plate with 750 µL of this dilution for 5 min.\n\tNOTE: This solution is extremely light sensitive, and plates should be kept foiled or shielded from light for the remainder of the experiment to avoid signal deterioration.\nAdd 2.5 µL of 0.3% H2O2 to this solution and incubate with continuous rocking for an additional 40 min at room temperature.\nWash 4x with 1x TBST for at least 15 min per wash with continuous rocking.\nRinse with 1x PBT.\nFix the cells by incubating for 1 h at room temperature in 1x MEMFA (100 mM MOPS, 1 mM EGTA, and 1 mM MgSO4 in 3.7% formaldehyde).\nRemove the solution and replace with 1x PBS. Store the plates in a foiled container at 4 °C until further processing.\n6. Imaging Cells\nNOTE: Imaging was performed using an inverted confocal microscope.\nPlace the sample plate on the microscope stage, aligning the mark made in step 3.1 to the front of the stage.\nFocus the image so that the grid-lined coverslip is visible and, using the grid image taken in step 3.4 as a reference, adjust the field of view to match the field of view captured in the calcium image (Section 3).\nAcquire bright-field images of both the grid and the cells.\nIlluminate the samples with a 595 nm TRITC laser. Adjust gain values to appropriately distinguish signal from background using the images from the negative control cells and acquire a still image.",
    "NOTE: Ideally, background fluorescence levels are determined based on a negative control plate processed in parallel with a non-targeting sense RNA probe. Gain settings are adjusted so that this plate appears completely black (corresponding to background levels), then held constant for other plates imaged from that experimental batch.\n7. Data Processing\nNOTE: Data processing was performed using Nikon Elements software.\nOpen the 2 h calcium image from step 3.7. Identify the pixels corresponding to each individual cell by selecting Binary > Spot Detection > Bright Spots. Make sure the FITC channel is selected.\nColored circles will appear over individual cells after this layer has been generated. Adjust the cell distribution and size parameters so that as many cells as possible are recognized and associated with a unique identifier.\nTrack the cells across all frames of the image by navigating to View > Analysis Controls > Tracking Options. Set 5 frames as the maximum gap between tracks, delete objects associated with fewer than 600 frames, and select the Close Gaps option. Select Track Binaries to apply cell tracking to the image.\nAfter the cells have been tracked, manually delete any object that does not correspond to an individual cell (for example a clump of cells). However, data points should not be excluded from further analysis based on the morphology of the calcium activity trace.\nOn the Image pane, select View Overlay > Show Binary Object ID. Scroll to the end of the image (Frame 901) and select Edit > Create View Snapshot (8bit RGB)> Current Frame > OK. This will create a snapshot of the last frame of the image with each cell's associated binary ID visible. Save this image.\nExport time-series data by selecting all objects followed by Export Data to Excel. Save output as a CSV file.",
    "Open the FISH image. Optimize spot detection as in steps 7.1–7.2, using the TRITC channel instead of the FITC channel. Manually delete any incorrectly assigned binaries, then select Automated Measurement Results > Update Measurement to calculate the signal intensity of each cell. Export an image snapshot and data table by repeating steps 7.5 and 7.6.\nCreate a spreadsheet where Column A is labeled FISH Binary ID and Column B is labeled Calcium Binary ID. Open the images exported in steps 7.5 and 7.7. For each object identified in the FISH image (step 7.7), record the binary ID in Column A. Then, locate the corresponding cell in the calcium image (step 7.5) and record that binary ID in Column B. Cells that cannot be confidently identified in both images should not be added to the spreadsheet.\n\tNOTE: It can be helpful to use a photo editing program such as Adobe Photoshop or GIMP image editor to open both images, make one semi-transparent, and overlay it onto its partner image to more easily identify and link the two binary IDs associated with each cell.\nFor each identified cell, collate (either manually or with a script) its time-series calcium data (associated with the Calcium Binary ID and exported in step 7.6) and its gene expression data (associated with the FISH Binary ID and exported in step 7.7).\n\tNOTE: Downstream data processing and analysis may involve collating these data into a single data table and applying an array of analytical techniques including spike counting, fractal analysis, and Markovian entropy that allow the investigator to discern novel patterns of calcium activity 17,18."
