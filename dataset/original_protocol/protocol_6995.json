    "Optional: Synchronization of animals for fixationTo compare results across control and mutant strains, it is important that animals are age-matched. However, this step may be omitted if the purpose of the experiment is to detect an epitope across all stages of the development of C. elegans nematodes.Grow C. elegans using standard methods on a 6 cm NGM plate seeded with OP50 E. coli (see wormbook.org for standard growth conditions and instructions for M9 solution, NGM plates, and culture of OP50).When many gravid hermaphrodites are present, wash worms off the plate(s) by pipetting 0.5 ml M9 solution onto the plate, tilting the plate to wash hermaphrodites off, and pipetting worm suspension into a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube. Add 20 μl of 5 M KOH and 100 μl of 5.65-7.5% sodium hypochlorite (bleach; we use Clorox. Optionally, a 5.65-6% sodium hypochlorite solution works just as well). Incubate for about 5-10 min, occasionally inverting tube to keep worms suspended. This step dissolves the adults but spares the embryos, which are surrounded by a tough eggshell.Every few minutes, check for disappearance of adults, either by viewing the tube under a dissecting microscope or holding it up to the light and viewing by eye. When few adults are visible in the suspension, spin tube(s) at ~900 × g (~3,000 rpm) in a benchtop centrifuge for ~20 s to pellet embryos (eggs) released by hypochlorite digestion of adults.Optional: Remove most of the supernatant by pipetting, but leave ~100 μl so that the pellet is undisturbed. Then add 900 μl M9 solution and resuspend to wash, eliminating most of the sodium hypochlorite. Sodium hypochlorite could induce oxidative stress that could alter expression of some genes. Spin tube(s) at ~900 × g (~3,000 rpm) in a benchtop centrifuge for ~20 s to pellet embryos (eggs).",
    "Remove most of the supernatant by pipetting but leave ~100 μl.Pipette up and down gently to resuspend the pellet of embryos in the 100 μl. (If few worms survive the sodium hypochlorite treatment, consider including one or two washes (Step A4) with M9 solution to remove the sodium hypochlorite).Pipette drops of the embryo suspension onto fresh NGM plates with lawns of OP50. Place the drops outside the lawn of OP50, and tilt the plates to spread the drop out so that the liquid (which still includes sodium hypochlorite) will more rapidly soak into the NGM plate and/or evaporate. (If embryos continue to soak in the hypochlorite mix too long, they will become non-viable). Try adding approximately 100-200 embryos per plate to each of five plates. If you don’t have enough embryos, scale up the number of starting plates that you synchronize by bleaching.Incubate at 20°C for approximately three days to reach the first day of adulthood. Temperature or time can be adjusted depending on differences in aging rate and reproduction of your worm strain to provide a loosely synchronized population of young adults or your desired larval stage.Note: This method isolates only embryos that are contained in the uterus of adult hermaphrodites. Embryonic development is occurring inside the adult hermaphrodite uterus, such that embryos could be several hours apart in terms of development. Therefore, embryos will be only loosely developmentally synchronized using this method. For tighter synchronization, other methods must be used. FixationCollect worms from 3-5 non-starved, non-contaminated plates by washing them off with M9 and transfer them to 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes. Many worms from several plates are needed because some worms are lost at each subsequent step.",
    "Because worms stick to the inside of plastic pipette tips, using sterile glass Pasteur pipettes to transfer worms in this step can help prevent the loss of worms.Wash four times over ~60 min by resuspending in 1 ml M9 so that the bacteria in the gut are excreted. Between washes, pellet worms by centrifuging at ~900 × g (~3,000 rpm) for 2 min before carefully withdrawing most of the supernatant using a pipette. Be sure to leave the pellet of worms untouched.Chill worms on ice and centrifuge at ~900 × g (~3,000 rpm) for 2 min. Remove supernatant to reduce volume to 500 μl, then add 500 μl ice-cold 2× Ruvkun buffer to a final concentration of 1×. Add 54 μl 37% formaldehyde (final concentration ~2%). Fixation by formaldehyde may negatively affect some epitopes, and its concentration (within a range of ~1-4%) may need to be adjusted by trial and error. Mix by inverting the tubes or pipetting.Freeze rapidly in liquid nitrogen or dry ice/ethanol. This step may help crack or permeabilize the tough worm cuticle. Frozen samples can be stored at -80°C.Melt the frozen worm pellet under tap water.Incubate on ice, inverting the tube occasionally, for 30 min.Wash worms twice in Tris-Triton buffer by centrifuging at ~900 × g (~3,000 rpm) for 2 min, carefully withdrawing supernatant, and resuspending in 1,000 μl Tris-Triton buffer. Triton detergent helps prevent worms from sticking to the pipettes, tubes, and one another.Pellet worms by centrifuging at ~400 × g (~2,000 rpm) for 2 min. After this step, the animals should be considered fragile. From this point on, when pelleting worms, centrifuge at no more than ~400 × g (~2,000 rpm). Remove supernatant, carefully avoiding pellet, and resuspend the worms in 500 μl Tris-Triton buffer +1% β-mercaptoethanol.",
    "Incubate for 2-8 h with gentle agitation on a rocker platform in a 37°C incubator. β-mercaptoethanol can reduce disulfide bonds in proteins, which may improve permeability of the cuticle. The incubation with β-mercaptoethanol at high temperature may also help to denature enzymes like DNases, proteases, and peroxidases that could damage epitopes.Wash the worms once by pelleting in the centrifuge, carefully removing supernatant, and resuspending with 1,000 μl 1× BO3 + 0.01% Triton buffer. The BO3 buffer has a basic pH that benefits the redox reactions in the subsequent steps.Pellet worms, remove supernatant leaving pellet undisturbed, and resuspend the worms in 500 μl of 1× BO3 + 0.01% Triton buffer + 10 mM DTT. Incubate for 15 min with gentle agitation on the rocker platform at room temperature. DTT also may improve cuticle permeability by further reducing disulfide bonds.Wash the worms once by pelleting in the centrifuge, carefully removing supernatant, and resuspending with 1,000 μl of 1× BO3 + 0.01% Triton buffer.Pellet worms, remove supernatant leaving the pellet undisturbed, and resuspend the worms in 500 μl of 1× BO3 + 0.01% Triton buffer + 0.3% H2O2. Incubate for 15 min with gentle agitation at room temperature. H2O2 may oxidize sulfhydryl groups to prevent disulfide bonds from reforming.Wash the worms once by pelleting in the centrifuge, carefully removing supernatant, and resuspending with 1,000 μl of 1× BO3 + 0.01% Triton buffer.Pellet by centrifugation, remove supernatant, and resuspend with 1,000 μl Antibody buffer B. Allow to wash for at least 15 min with gentle agitation at room temperature to remove any residual BO3 buffer or H2O2. Pellet by spinning at ~400 × g (~2,000 rpm) for 2 min and resuspend in ~100-300 μl of Antibody buffer A, depending on how many worms are present.",
    "Worms are now fixed and can be safely stored for up to a month at 4°C in Antibody buffer A.Primary Antibody BindingResuspend fixed worms by gently inverting the tube, then transfer 30 μl of fixed worms to a fresh 1.5 ml tube using a pipette tip that has been cut to enlarge the opening (this may prevent damage to the fragile fixed worms). Visually confirm that many worms are present and, if necessary, adjust volume. There should be hundreds of worms.Add 170 μl Antibody buffer A with the appropriate amount of the desired primary antibody. For example, we often use GT335 (a monoclonal antibody that binds the branch point glutamate of post-translationally polyglutamylated proteins, such as tubulins) at a dilution of 1:450. If we had three C. elegans strains to compare, we would dilute 1.33 μl GT335 into 510 μl Antibody buffer A, and then add 170 μl of the dilution to the 30 μl worm suspension for the final dilution of 1:450 in a final volume of 200 μl. Incubate overnight, either at room temperature or at 4 °C in a cold room, depending on the antibody documentation. (Incubation time can be reduced, but a minimum of 2 h is recommended to allow diffusion through cuticle and tissues.) Dilution and incubation temperature may need to be determined empirically. Especially when trying a new antibody, it is also worthwhile to include a control in which no primary antibody is added. Use a rocker to provide gentle agitation.Wash the worms twice with Antibody buffer B by pelleting in the centrifuge, carefully removing all but the last ~50-100 μl of supernatant, and resuspending in 500 μl Antibody buffer B.",
    "Then pellet worms, remove supernatant, and resuspend worms for a third time in at least 500 μl Antibody buffer B and incubate for at least 2 h to overnight with gentle rocking at room temperature to eliminate all unbound primary antibody.Wash the worms once by pelleting in the centrifuge, carefully removing all but the last ~50-100 μl of supernatant, and resuspending in 500 μl Antibody buffer A. Pellet worms and remove supernatant leaving approximately the last 50 μl.Secondary Antibody BindingAdd 150 μl of the secondary antibody diluted in Antibody buffer A for a final volume of 200 μl. We typically use Alexa-fluor 568-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:2,000 or 1:2,500 in the final volume of 200 μl of worm suspension. Enclose the tubes in a cardboard freezer box or cover with aluminum foil to protect from light, and incubate at room temperature for 2 h on the rocker.Wash worms five times over several hours by pelleting in the centrifuge, carefully removing all but the last ~50-100 μl of supernatant, resuspending in 500 μl Antibody buffer B, and gently rocking to remove unbound secondary antibody. If excessive non-specific secondary antibody staining is observed, continue washing worms with Antibody buffer B for several more hours and/or leave on rocker in Antibody buffer B overnight. Fixed stained worms can be stored for a month or more at 4°C.Make an agarose pad by adding a drop of liquid 2% agarose to a slide and immediately placing another slide on top to create a flat thin layer. Remove the top slide and mount worms for imaging by using a pipette tip that has been cut to slightly enlarge the opening to transfer a drop of 3-5 μl onto the agarose pad.",
    "Position gently using an eyelash glued to a toothpick and apply a cover slip before imaging. Use the eyelash to manually clear away any debris or precipitates that might remain from the fixation or staining process. If few stained worms are transferred to the slide, allow worms to settle to the bottom of the tube and either reduce the volume in the tube or draw worms up directly from the pellet rather than resuspending, before attempting to mount worms again."
