    "1. Induction of Benign Non-invasive Tumors\nUse stocks listed in Table 2 for the induction of benign tumors.\nPrepare a starter culture for the \"tester\" stock of the following genotype: y,w, ey-FLP1; Tub-Gal80,FRT40A; Act5C>y+>Gal4, UAS-GFP\nPrepare a starter culture for the \"tested\" stock of the following genotype: w; FRT40A, UAS-RasV12/CyO\nCollect ten female virgins from the \"tester\" stock and ten males from the \"tested\" stock.\nCross the males and females from the \"tester\" and the \"tested\" stock by placing them both in a vial with fly food.\nPlace the cross in a 25 °C incubator and allow the males and females to mate and lay eggs for 24-48 hr.\nCheck the vials for sufficient egg deposition and for the presence of first instar larvae making sure that the culture is not drying out.\n\t\nAdd a few drops of autoclaved distilled water to the culture to keep it moist (if the culture is drying out).\nContinue to monitor the culture and repeat step 1.7.1 as needed.\nObserve wandering third instar larvae under a fluorescence stereomicroscope as outlined in section 3.\n2. Induction of Invasive Tumors\nUse stocks listed in Table 2 for the induction of invasive tumors.\nUse the starter culture from step 1.2 above of the following genotype: y,w, ey-FLP1; Tub-Gal80,FRT40A; Act5C>y+>Gal4, UAS-GFP\nPrepare a starter culture for the \"tested\" stock of the following genotype: w; lgl4, FRT40A, UAS-RasV12/CyO\nCollect ten female virgins from the \"tester\" stock and ten males from the \"tested\" stock.\nCross the males and females from the \"tester\" and the \"tested\" stock by placing them both in a vial with fly food.\nPlace the cross in a 25 °C incubator and allow the males and females to mate and lay eggs for 24-48 hr.",
    "Check the vials for sufficient egg deposition and for the presence of first instar larvae making sure that the culture is not drying out.\n\t\nAdd a few drops of autoclaved distilled water to the culture to keep it moist (if the culture is drying out).\nContinue to monitor the culture for dryness and repeat step 2.7.1 as needed.\nObserve third instar larvae under a fluorescence stereomicroscope as outlined in section 3.\n3. Observation of Benign and Invasive Tumors\nUse third instar larvae for benign tumor isolation and visualization.\n\t\nWet a paint brush in distilled water, and using this paint brush scrape a few third instar larvae from the wall of the culture vial.\nPlace larvae in a depression slide with 1X PBS and then using a wet paint brush scrape off any food material from the larval epidermis.\nPlace the larvae in a Petri plate and leave at -20 °C freezer for 30 min to immobilize the larva.\n\t\t\nAlternative method to immobilize larvae using FLYNAP.\nPlace a FLYNAP wand dipped in FLYNAP to the vial from 3.1.3.2 and after plugging the vial let plugged vial with larvae stand for 30 to 40 min.\nPlace the immobilized larva on a glass slide, add a drop of light halocarbon oil, cover with a cover glass and observe under a fluorescence stereomicroscope with the capability to visualize Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP).\nThe benign tumor bearing larvae will fluoresce green in the anterior region where the cephalic complex is present.\nSelect day 10 larvae (after induction) from the culture set in step #2 above for observation of invasive tumors. Day 10 larvae are selected because invasive tumor bearing larvae have an extended larval stage and generally fail to pupariate.\nFollow steps 3.1.1 to 3.1.4 except instead of third instar larvae use day 10 larvae.",
    "The day 10 invasive tumor bearing larvae will fluoresce green in the anterior region where the cephalic complex is present.\nIf the fluorescent microscope is equipped with a digital camera then take pictures of the fluorescing benign and invasive tumor bearing larvae.\n4. Dissection of the Cephalic Complex and Further Observation of Benign and Invasive Tumors\nThe translucent epidermis of the larva makes it difficult to observe the extent of invasion of tumors. Thus the extent of invasion is better visualized by dissecting the cephalic complex out of the larva. The following steps should be utilized to dissect the cephalic complex.\nUsing a wet paint brush select third instar larvae (for benign tumors) and day 10 larvae (for invasive tumors) from the respective culture vials.\nPlace larvae in a well of a dissection dish containing cold 1X PBS. Use paint brush to scrape off any food particles from the larval epidermis.\n\t\nTransfer clean larvae to a fresh well of the dissection dish containing cold 1X PBS.\nCheck for presence of GFP fluorescence using a stereomicroscope capable of detecting fluorescence. Discard non-GFP bearing larvae.\nAdd 1.0ml of cold 1X PBS to a fresh well on the dissection dish and using a pair of forceps transfer a larva bearing either the benign or invasive tumors (the dissection protocol remains the same for these two types of tumors).\nHold the larva down using a pair of forceps about 2/3rds from the anterior end.\n\t\nUse the other pair of forceps and smartly separate the posterior 1/3rd of the larva and discard it.\nLet go of the anterior 2/3rds of the larva. As the pressure inside the larva is released the contents of the larva will ooze out of the body cavity.",
    "Use a pair of forceps to remove the gut, fat body and other inner contents of the larva that have oozed out of the body cavity.\nUse a pair of forceps to hold the mouth hook of the larva and push it into the larval epidermis and using the other pair of forceps invert the larva completely.\nUse the forceps to gently and carefully remove the fat body, salivary glands, gut, the wing disc complex and any tracheal tubes. The cephalic complex should now be visible attached to the mouth hook of the inverted larva. The brain hemispheres and the ventral nerve cord (VNC) would still be connected to the larval epidermis through the nerves emanating from the VNC.\nUse a pair of forceps to gently break the connections between the cephalic nerves and the larval epidermis.\nAs the nerve connections between the VNC and the larval epidermis are broken and excess fat body and other tissue removed, the cephalic complex would become clearly visible and will be attached to the larval epidermis only at the mouth hooks.\nThe cephalic complex can be left attached to the larval epidermis if the complex needs to be fixed for downstream applications like antibody staining or for later visualization.\nIf no further downstream applications would be performed then the cephalic complex can be detached from the larval epidermis and placed in a drop of a glycerol based mounting media for further observation and analysis. Use VECTASHIELD as the mounting media.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
