    "The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Region Midtjylland (1-10-72-259-21) and performed in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration and its amendments.\n1. Fabrication of a custom-made spacer (optional)\nNOTE: A custom-made 3D-printed spacer may be used during image acquisition to standardize the positioning of the camera head. The spacer is not mandatory for the recording of the fluorescence images.\nDesign of the spacer\n\t\nDesign a spacer that fits the camera head of the intraoral fluorescence camera. To do so, perform a scan of the camera head with a digital scanner. Import the scan into dedicated software.\nDesign the spacer to fit the camera head with the desired morphology and positioning distance to the camera head (i.e., 4 mm). Export as an STL file (an example of a design is attached as Supplemental File S1).\nAdditive manufacturing of the spacer\n\t\nOpen the printer-associated additive manufacturing software, and select the basic settings. Click on Printer | Select the available 3D printer | Next | Shape: Clear | Next | Print mode: 50 microns | Next | Build Style: Standard | Next.\nImport the STL file by clicking on File | Import | Select the STL file | Open.\nDefine the position of the spacer on the print platform; click on Transform, and drag the spacer to a corner of the platform as close to the surface of the platform as possible.\nTo print additional spacers, click on Copy | Linear pattern. Adjust the count and distance to fit additional objects to the print platform, and click on Set.\nTo design the support of the objects, click on Smart support | Style: General | Generate | Type: Gate | Create support.",
    "Send the print job to the 3D printer. Click on Add to queue. The software automatically performs a quality check of the STL file to identify errors when adding to the queue. Then, click on Add to queue | Job name | F4X | Add to queue.\nMount a clean print platform on the 3D printer, and add an appropriate resin. Click on Start job, and scan the QR code of the resin. Confirm that the print platform is empty and clean, that the resin tray is full, and that the resin has been stirred before addition. Click on Start job.\nWhen the print job is finished, remove the spacers from the print platform.\nClean the spacers in an ultrasound bath with isopropanol for 3 min. Repeat the cleaning using fresh isopropanol. Air-dry the spacers.\nSecure the total polymerization of the material by polymerizing the spacers in a post-curing oven for 10 min.\nRemove the support material, and stain the spacers to prevent light from penetrating through the material.\n2. Plaque disclosure and image acquisition\nMount the custom-made spacer on the fluorescence camera (optional). Connect the intraoral camera to a computer, and open the camera software.\nClick on Patient | New patient to create the patient in the system. Fill out the patient information. Click on Patient | Save to save the patient data. Click on Video. The intraoral camera is now ready to use.\nDim the room lights.\nApply a red disclosing dye (i.e., 5% erythrosine) with a cotton pellet on the tooth surfaces of interest to disclose the plaque.\nInstruct the patient to rinse with water for 10 s to remove excess dye. Remove any gingival stain using a cotton pellet. Air-dry each tooth for 3 s.",
    "Place the intraoral camera in a horizontal position in front of the tooth of interest, with the spacer touching the gingiva/adjacent teeth. Acquire the fluorescence image by pressing the camera button.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that the entire tooth surface of interest is in focus and captured in the image without including antagonist or contralateral tooth surfaces.\nRepeat steps 2.4-2.6 for all the teeth of interest.\nMark all the images in the camera software. Click on Save images/videos in the menu.\n\tNOTE: Make sure that the images are saved in \"plaque\"-mode and not in \"caries\"-mode. The symbol P/C in the menu indicates the current mode.\nTo export the images, go to the Viewer. Choose the images to be exported. Click on File | Export (save as…) | All images of the patient to export the images. In the export window, choose the following settings: Mode: Standard | Export path: Choose the desired folder | Image type selection: Check off the left box | Image state: Original data. Expand the export window to display more options. Select the following: File name contains: Cardnumber OR User input OR Patient name | Format: TIF. Click on OK to export the images.\n\t\nAlternatively, set up an automated file export prior to imaging. Click on Options | Show configuration | Modules | Viewer | Export/Email | Export options | Mode: Autoexport| Export path: Choose the desired folder | Image state: Original data. Select the following: File name contains: Cardnumber OR User input OR Patient name | Format: TIF. Click on OK to set up the default export settings. When the automated file export is set up, the images will automatically be exported when saved (step 2.8).\n3. Digital image analysis",
    "NOTE: The digital image analysis can be performed at any time after the image acquisition. Batches of up to 1,000 fluorescence images can be processed in parallel. If the analysis of large image batches exceeds the computing power, the image size may be reduced prior to analysis.\nQuantification of the total tooth area\n\t\nRename all the images with sequential index numbers (i.e., Planimetry_001, Planimetry_002,…). Import the fluorescence image series into a dedicated image analysis software (i.e. Daime15) in Red-Green-Blue (RGB) mode by clicking on File | Import images | Import as color.\nPerform a threshold-based segmentation of the image series by clicking Segment | Automatic segmentation | Custom threshold. Set the \"Low\" threshold above the intensity of the oral soft tissues (i.e., 80). Leave the \"High\" threshold at 255. Thus, only the teeth (both clean and plaque-covered areas) are recognized as objects in the software. Click on Apply | OK | Segment! to initiate the segmentation.\nOpen the visualizer by double-clicking on the name of the image series. Enter the object editor (OBJ). Perform a visual quality control of the segmented images, and delete artifacts by rejecting and deleting such objects.\nMerge the remaining objects in all the images (In all images | Merge selected objects). Now, there is one object per image. Quantify the total tooth area in each image (Analysis | Measure objects | Clear all | Pixels). Export the data.\nQuantification of the plaque-covered areas\n\t\nImport the fluorescence image series again into the software, this time with split red, green, and blue color channels (File | Import images | Import as grey). Close the blue channel images. Transfer the object layer from the RGB images to the red channel images (Segment | Transfer object layer).",
    "Delete non-object pixels in the red channel images using the object editor (In all images | Delete non-object pixels (voxels)). Soft tissues are now removed from the images.\nTo enhance the contrast between plaque-covered and clean tooth areas, multiply the red channel image series by a factor of two (Edit | Image calculator | Multiplication | Parameters: Factor 2.00 | Apply | OK).\nTo remove clean tooth areas from the images, subtract the green channel image series from the enhanced red channel image series (Edit | Image calculator | Second operand images: Planimetry_green | Subtraction | Apply | OK).\nTo identify the plaque-covered areas on the teeth, perform a threshold-based segmentation of the resulting image series (Segment | Automatic segmentation | Custom threshold). Set the \"Low\" threshold above the intensity of the clean tooth areas (i.e., 80). Leave the \"High\" threshold at 255. Only plaque-covered areas are recognized as objects in the software. Click on Apply | OK | Segment! to initiate the segmentation.\nPerform a visual quality control of the segmented images in the object editor, and delete artifacts by rejecting and deleting such objects. Merge the remaining objects in all the images (In all images | Merge selected objects). Quantify the plaque-covered area in each image (Analysis | Measure objects | Clear all | Pixels). Export the data.\nOpen the exported data tables in a dedicated software. Calculate the PPI according to equation (1):\n\t\tEquation (1)     imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65035/65035eq01.jpg"
