    "Note: The present study was carried out according to the guidelines provided by CPCSEA (Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals, Ministry of Environments and Forests, Government of India). Surgery protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee of our department under registration with CPCSEA (CPCSEA/ORG/CH/REG NO.925/295). Maintenance of fishZebrafish stock population is either bred in our animal house facility or obtained from local pet shop. Fish are kept in separate groups of 15 in the aquatic system maintained at 28 °C on a 14 h light and 10 h dark cycle.Preparation of surgical plates106 mm glass Petri dish is used and moist tissue paper is placed in it, where the anesthetized fish is laid laterally (Figure 1a; Video 1). The gill is covered with tissue paper soaked in water or PBS.Fishes of same size and age (approximately 3-4 cm in length, 4-6 months old) are anaesthetized by dipping them in 0.02% tricaine (MS222) for 3-5 min (long exposure like 10 min or more could affect post-surgical recovery of spinal cord injured fish) at room temperature. It is important to check that fish are completely anaesthetized prior to surgery. After placing the anaesthetized fish on the Petri dish, the body is touched with a needle and absence of twitching movement confirms complete anaesthesia. Petri dish with anaesthetized fish is placed under stereozoom dissecting microscope and surgery is performed under the microscope.Surgery protocolCrush injury:A longitudinal incision is given with a single-edged blade on the second stripe of the fish body at the level of the dorsal fin, which corresponds to the 15/16th vertebrae (Figure 1b; Video 1). After making the cutaneous wound (Figure 1c; Video 1), one has to scrape muscle sidewise to reach the vertebral column, which resides at a much deeper level.",
    "Blood coming to the wound site can be cleared by using a sterile cotton swab (Figure1d; Video 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161130/20161130012351_6390.jpgFigure 1.

Inflicting spinal cord injury in adult zebrafish  Vertebral column is a hard but translucent tissue and spinal cord, encased within the vertebrae, is visible as the meninges are pigmented. After clearing the surrounding tissues, vertebral column is crushed dorso-ventrally with Dumont forceps #5 for 1 sec (Video 1; Figures 2 and 4, where the injury epicentre is marked with an asterisk).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161130/20161130012455_1311.jpgFigure 2.

Star indicates the injury epicentre.One can use the bony projections of vertebral column and mark the corresponding fin rays of dorsal fin as a land mark.",
    "We cannot perform laminectomy in zebrafish spine, as we do while inflicting SCI in mouse, because the vertebral column is too thin here. After completing injury, surrounding muscle tissues are placed back to cover the injury site and only a single suture can be given through skin to reduce the wound size. Fishes are returned into shallow water in a Petri dish and water is gently blown over the gills using a plastic pipette so that fish can recover from anaesthesia quickly and can swim on their own. Fishes are finally transferred to larger tanks and allowed to regenerate for a specified period of time at 28 °C.Transection injurySimilar to crush injury a longitudinal incision is given on the skin laterally with a single-edged blade on the second stripe of the fish body at the level of dorsal fin, which corresponds to the 15/16th vertebrae. After carefully scrapping the muscle beneath the wound, spinal cord encased in the vertebral column can be visualised clearly. On reaching the vertebral column deep to the wound site, the spinal cord is completely transected using a micro-dissecting spring scissors (Figures 3 and 4).As spinal cord is a soft spongy tissue, a sharp cut through the gap between the two vertebrae by the two blades of micro-scissors is enough to ensure complete transection separating the rostral and caudal stumps completely from each other. The injury epicentre is marked with an asterisk in Figure 4c. The injury would lead to paralysis of posterior part of the body. After completing injury procedures, surrounding muscle tissues are placed back to cover the vertebral wound. The suture may be given through the skin (Figure S1[href=https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20161128/20161128214839_5292.docx]) or tissue glue can be used (optional) to reduce the wound size.",

SC = Spinal cord, VC = Vertebral column.Histological analysis to study time course after injuryLuxol fast blue and cresyl violet staining (0.05% lithium carbonate solution and glacial acetic acid are used for differentiation step) is performed on the spinal cord tissue sections according to the standard Klüver-Barrera protocol (Sheehan and Hrapchak, 1980). Both uninjured and injured fishes are dissected, spinal cord taken out, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, decalcified in 0.5 M EDTA, passed through graded alcohol and xylene and embedded in paraffin (Hui et al., 2010). Time course analysis of stained section in uninjured cord shows relative distribution of white matter and grey matter as depicted in Figure 5a.",
    "Anatomical distribution of neurons in the subependymal and axons and cell bodies in white matter are obvious. Details of the cellular components are discussed in our previous publication (Hui et al., 2010). Here substantial tissue loss is shown at the early stages after crush injury (Figure 5b) with some tissue sparing, a characteristic feature of the crush injury model. Time course cellular response depends on the degree and extent of injury. In this case, as the transection injury is very clean, not much tissue has been lost and the stump tissues are very closely apposed (Figure 5c). Regeneration is very impressive and the time frame does not vary much when compared with crush injury.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161130/20161130012926_9928.jpgFigure 5.
