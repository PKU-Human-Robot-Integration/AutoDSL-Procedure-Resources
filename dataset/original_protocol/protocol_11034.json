    "The murine experiments were planned and performed in accordance with regulations and under animal protocol #AABB1502, reviewed and approved by Columbia University's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The mice were housed at a proper animal care facility that ensures the humane treatment of mice and provides appropriate veterinary care for the mice and laboratory safety training for the laboratory personnel.\n1. Treatment of mice with 4NQO to induce esophageal IEN and ESCC lesions (time consideration: up to 28 weeks)\nNOTE: To generate MEOs representing neoplastic esophageal lesions, the mice are subjected to 4NQO-mediated chemical carcinogenesis as previously described by Tang et al.14. Normal/non-neoplastic MEOs are generated from untreated mice.\nMice\n\t\nHouse four to five mice per cage, and acclimate them to the animal facility for at least 1 week before starting an experiment. To reduce the possibility that age-related disorders result in premature termination of the full 28 week experiment, start with 8 week old to 16 week old mice.\n\t\tNOTE: C57BL/6 mice weighing approximately 20-30 g were utilized in this protocol. For shorter experiments, older mice may be used. Male or female mice are acceptable. Control (no treatment, see section 1.3.1) mice must be matched in age and sex.\nPreparation of drinking water containing 4NQO\n\t\nPrepare 1 mg/mL 4NQO stock solution in ethylene propylene glycol (Table of Materials). Dissolve 100 mg of 4NQO into 100 mL of 99.9% ethylene propylene glycol in a 500 mL glass beaker covered with sealing film. Mix thoroughly at room temperature (RT) using a magnetic stirrer at 800 rpm for 30 min. Store at 4 °C.",
    "Add 900 mL of autoclaved deionized water to 100 mL of 1 mg/mL 4NQO stock solution, and mix by inversion in a 2 L plastic graduated cylinder covered with sealing film. A volume of 1 L of 100 µg/mL 4NQO in 10% ethylene propylene glycol will serve two mouse cages equipped with a 500 mL drinking bottle.\n\t\tCAUTION: Of note, 4NQO is a synthetic chemical carcinogen that may cause cancer. Handle with nitrile gloves and a long-sleeved lab coat, and wear closed-toe shoes. Consider proper eye protection, face protection, and head covering. For waste disposal, 4NQO should be placed in a labeled container in accordance with institutional guidelines for hazardous waste management by environmental health and safety.\nTreatment with 4NQO and monitoring\n\t\nAttach the drinking bottle, and administer 4NQO via the drinking water ad libitum to the mice for 16 weeks. Use 10% (w/v) propylene glycol as a vehicle (no treatment) control.\n\t\tNOTE: Shorter durations of 4NQO treatment may be used to induce IEN.\nRefill the water once per week.\nWeigh each mouse weekly by placing it in a plastic container on a laboratory balance.\nAt the end of the 16 week 4NQO treatment period, start giving the mice regular drinking water during the post-4NQO observation period for up to 12 weeks (Figure 1).\nMonitor the mice daily for signs of distress (e.g., impaired mobility, hunched habitus, and withdrawn behavior), dysphagia, and dehydration. Additionally, evaluate the mice weekly for changes in body weight or food and liquid intake. Should the body weight drop by more than 10% from the initial body weight, feed the mice with a liquid dietary supplement.",
    "NOTE: A loss of body weight refractory to liquid dietary supplements may be indicative of ESCC, and mice that lose more than 20% of their body weight should be euthanized. Importantly, MEOs can be generated from prematurely euthanized mice. Note that C57BL/6 mice without genetic modifications do not typically display signs of morbidity or have visible ESCC lesions until the end of the post-4NQO observation period.\nAnimal preparation\n\t\nEuthanize the mice in a CO2 chamber filled with CO2 at a flow rate that displaces 30%-70% of the chamber volume per minute. Confirm death by cervical dislocation.\nPin the limbs and nose of the mouse in the supine position to the dissection platform using 21 G needles.\nDisinfect the ventral surface of the mouse with 70% ethanol.\nDissection (time consideration: 0.5 h)\n\t\nOpen the skin by pinching the midabdominal fur and skin to ensure it is released from the viscera below. Use the surgical scissors to make a craniocaudal, ventral midline incision from the lower abdomen to the chin.\nStarting at the midline incision, use surgical scissors to make radial cuts extending to the limbs on both sides of the mouse. Flay the skin flaps open.\nTo expose the cervical trachea, use the dissecting scissors to divide the salivary glands at the midline. The trachea lies deep in the glands.\nTo expose the thoracic trachea, remove the sternum.\n\t\t\nGently pinch and lift the peritoneum with forceps, and use scissors to divide the peritoneum craniocaudally and laterally along the rib cage.\nGently retract the liver from the caudal surface of the diaphragm, and use scissors to make a small incision in the diaphragm at the sternal notch, specifically at the dorsal surface of the xiphoid process. This releases the lung and heart from the visceral pleura.",
    "Separate the ribcage from the thoracic contents. Insert scissors into the incision in the diaphragm, and dissect cranially to the cervical girdle. During this dissection, adhere closely to the dorsal surface of the sternum to avoid damage to the organs below. Ensure that the plane of dissection is anterior to the trachea.\nCut the ribs on either side of the sternum using scissors, and remove the sternum. Ensure that the thoracic contents are exposed.\nExpose the abdominal esophagus. Gently lift the stomach anteriorly by holding the antrum with forceps. Dissect the spleen, pancreas, and mesentery off the stomach and esophagus with scissors.\nExpose the thoracic esophagus (Figure 2).\n\t\t\nGently lift the trachea immediately caudal to the thyroid cartilage, and dissect the esophagus of the dorsal side of the trachea using iris scissors.\nDivide the trachea at the thyroid cartilage with iris scissors.\nPeel the trachea off the remainder of the esophagus via careful dissection in the caudal direction.\nRemove the lung, heart, and thymus en masse with the trachea. Take care to avoid damage to the esophagus when dissecting and dividing the aorta and vena cava.\nDivide the stomach at the pylorus with scissors.\nSeparate the esophagus from the vertebra by holding the antrum with forceps and dissecting cranially.\nDivide the esophagus at the level of the thyroid cartilage, and harvest the esophagus and stomach en masse (Figure 3).\nSeparate the stomach and esophagus by dividing the esophagus at the cardia (Figure 4, top panel, red line).\nDissect off any fascia on the outer surface of the esophagus. To reserve a sample for histology (optional), remove half of the esophagus and split longitudinally with scissors. Place the remaining intact esophagus in cold PBS on ice.",
    "Open the stomach along the greater curvature, and wash with PBS sufficiently. Separate the forestomach, and wash with cold PBS. Place the forestomach in cold PBS on ice.\nTo harvest the tongue, remove the 21 G needle on the nose, and pull out the tongue with tweezers. Cut the tongue as long as possible. Place the tongue in cold PBS on ice.\n2. Establishment of murine esophageal organoid (MEO) culture\nNOTE: This protocol can also be used to establish a murine tongue organoid culture with the addition of a step in which the tongue tissue is minced before trypsinization. See the note in step 2.2.3.\nPreparation of reagents\n\tNOTE: A list of reagents may be found in the Table of Materials. Prepare and store the stock solutions according to the manufacturer's instructions unless otherwise indicated.\n\t\nEnsure that the single-use aliquots of the basement membrane matrix (BME) utilized in this protocol are stored at −20 °C until the day of use, are subsequently thawed on ice or at 2-8 °C, and are kept on ice at all times when not in use.\nDissolve 250 mg of soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI) in 1,000 mL of PBS (250 mg/mL stock concentration), and filter-sterilize (0.22 µm) it. Dispense 50 mL aliquots into conical tubes, and store for up to 6 months at 4 °C.\nPrepare the mouse organoid medium (MOM): Supplement advanced DMEM/F12 with 1 mM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), 2% R-Spondin and Noggin conditioned medium (RN CM), 1x N-2 supplement, 1x B-27 supplement, 10 mM HEPES, 1x antibiotic-antimycotic, 1x GlutaMAX supplement, and 100 ng/mL mouse epidermal growth factor (mEGF). Prepare the MOM 500 mL at a time, divide it into 50 mL aliquots, and store at 2-8 °C until ready to use. Add 0.5 µg/mL amphotericin B and 10 µM Y-27632 just prior to use.",
    "Prewarm the MOM, 0.25% trypsin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI) to 37 °C in a water or bead bath before use.\nIsolation of keratinocytes from the dissected mouse tissue (time consideration: 2 h)\n\t\nTransfer the esophageal tissue into 500 µL of dispase in PBS (2.5-5 units total), and incubate in a thermomixer for 10 min at 37 °C and 800 rpm.\nTransfer the tissue to a culture dish, and carefully remove the muscle layer from the epithelium using forceps (Figure 4).\n\t\tNOTE: This step can also be performed by an experienced researcherprior to incubation with dispase.\nTransfer the epithelium to a microcentrifuge tube containing 500 µL of 0.25% trypsin, and incubate in a thermomixer for 10 min at 37 °C and 800 rpm.\n\t\tNOTE: If the starting material is tongue tissue, mince the tissue with a sterile scalpel into smaller pieces, approximately 1-2 mm2 in size, before adding the trypsin.\nBriefly centrifuge for 5-10 s at 2,000 x g to pellet the tissue. Prepare a 50 mL conical tube with a 100 µm cell strainer. Transfer the tissue/cell suspension through the strainer with a wide bore tip using circular motions.\nAdd 3 mL of STI through the strainer, using circular motions to wash.\nScrub the strainer with the base of a 1 mL tuberculin syringe plunger to push the cells through.\nWash the strainer with 3 mL of PBS 3-5 times, scrubbing the strainer with the base of the syringe between washes.\nCentrifuge the tube at 300 x g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet the cells.\nRemove the supernatant, leaving 1 mL of solution in the tube.\nResuspend the pellet in the remaining 1 mL, and transfer the cell suspension through a 70 µm cell strainer into a new 50 mL conical tube.",

Maximize the number of wells plated and prepare enough cells in BME for one extra well according to the example calculations below.\n\t\tNOTE: Cryopreserve any excess cells in the cryopreservation medium (10% DMSO in FBS) at a maximum concentration of 1 x 106 cells/mL. Store the cryovials in a freezing container overnight at −80 °C. Transfer them to vapor phase liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.\nIn a microcentrifuge tube, prepare an appropriate cell dilution in MOM first, and then add BME using a wide bore tip just before plating.\nUsing a 200 µL wide bore tip, slowly add a 50 µL droplet to the center of the well, avoiding contact between the tip and the bottom or sides of the well (Figure 5). Be careful not to use too much force to expel the liquid from the tip, or the dome will flatten.\nAllow the BME to solidify for 30 min in a 37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% relative humidity (RH) incubator.\nCarefully add 500 µL of MOM per well supplemented with 0.5 µg/mL amphotericin B and 10 µM Y-27632.\n\t\tNOTE: Add amphotericin to all the MOM throughout the initial primary culture. Add Y-27632 only on the day of passaging (day 0) for all passages.\nChange the MOM on days 3-4 and then every 2-3 days after that until ready to passage.",
