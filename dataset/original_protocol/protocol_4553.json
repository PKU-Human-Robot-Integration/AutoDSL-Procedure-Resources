    "Live imaging of Golgi apparatus by using Confocal microscopeThis protocol is suitable for performing the long-term live imaging of plant cells. Put seeds on ½X MS media solidified with 0.8% Bacto agar and grow them vertically at 22 °C for 4-5 days under continuous light.Collect 4-5 days old Arabidopsis seedlings and transfer them onto ½X MS media solidified with 0.8% Bacto agar, including inhibitor or control DMSO solvent.Note: To prevent damaging root cells of Arabidopsis seedlings, transferring Arabidopsis seedlings by holding cotyledons with light forceps are recommended. Inhibitor stocks are dissolved in DMSO and thus corresponding amount of DMSO should be contained in control medium. Working concentration of inhibitors can vary depending on chemicals and cell types analyzed but it is normally 10-100 µM. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150904/20150904233731_5732.jpgFigure 1. Preparing specimen for long-term live cell imaging using Arabidopsis seedlings. A. Required materials. B-I. Sample preparation for imaging Arabidopsis cells. Transfer Arabidopsis seedlings and solid media onto the Lab-Tek Chambered Coverglass. Seedlings should be sandwiched between coverslips and solid media (see Video 1 and Figure 1).    <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p>   Video 1. Specimen preparation for long-term live cell imaging using Arabidopsis seedlings  Place prepared Lab-Tek Chambered Coverglass on the inverted confocal laser microscope equipped with 63x or 100x objectives.Focus specimen and observe cells.Note: Observing cells located close to the coverslip, such as epidermal cells, can provide better image. For performing long-term time lapse imaging, be sure that the objective does not dry out. To prevent water immersion objective from drying, place one drop of Zeiss Immersol W directly onto the objectives or coverslips as immersion medium. As a marker of Golgi apparatus, fluorescently labeled ERD2, ST, COPI proteins can be used (Naramoto et al., 2014). Please note that this experimental setup allows for limited gas exchange, which might affect several processes in the plant.",
    "Alternatives for long-term imaging include imaging chambers or microfluidic devices for plants (Busch et al., 2012). Detailed live-imaging analysis of Golgi-localized proteins by using TIRF microscopyThis protocol is suitable for visualizing the detailed subcellular localization of proteins that localized around cell surface.Place seeds on ½X MS solid media (0.8% Bacto agar) and grow them vertically on 22 °C for 7 days under the continuous light.Transfer 7-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings into ½X MS liquid medium and incubate them for longer than 30 min. If necessary, inhibitor or DMSO control solvent can be added. Note: Incubation time can vary depending on the experiments but it is normally from 30 min to 2 h.Excise root or hypocotyl segments from 7-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings by using fine scissors or surgical knives (see Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150904/20150904233812_8509.jpgFigure 2. Excision of Arabidopsis roots for TIRF microscopy imaging. A. 7-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings. B. 7-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings, excised by scissor. Excision position at roots or hypocotyls are indicated by dashed white line.Mount root or hypocotyl segments with liquid media using glass slides and cover slips. Place prepared specimen on the TIRF microscope equipped with an oil immersion CFI Apo TIRF 100x H/1.49 numerical aperture objective.Focus the specimen and observe cells.Note: Only cells in contact with the surface of coverslip can be imaged. For the roots, cells in elongation zone, especially those close to the differentiation zone, are suitable for observation. Please see example TIRF image of pGNOM::GNOM-GFP that localize at Golgi apparatus (see Video 2).    <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p>   Video 2. Live imaging of GNOM-GFP localized at Golgi apparatus by TIRF microscopy as described in this protocol  Immunogold labeling of Golgi localized proteins by using TEMSubmerge seedlings grown on ½ MS plates and expressing a fluorescently-tagged Golgi-localized protein in a drop of 0.1 M sucrose.",
    "Cut 1 mm-long root segments and place them inside freezing planchet (Figure 3A) filled with 0.1 M sucrose. Besides transgenic roots expressing fluorescently-tagged proteins, process also wild-type samples to use as negative controls during immunolabeling. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150904/20150904233917_9186.jpgFigure 3. Preparation of root samples for immunogold labeling. A. Freezing planchets for high-pressure freezing. B. Mounting of HM20 resin-embedded roots on stubs for sectioning. Place another freezer planchet on top, flat side down, to close the chamber. Freeze the two planchets containing the root segments in a high-pressure freezer.Under liquid nitrogen, separate the two planchets and transfer the one containing the frozen roots to a cryovial with cryosubstitution solution.Place cryovial with cryosubstitution solution and samples into a cryosubstitution device pre-cooled to -90 °C. Samples should remain at -90 °C for at least 3 days. Raise the temperature of the cryosubstitution device to -60 °C. Remove cryosubstitution solution and rinse samples with fresh, pre-cooled (-60 °C) anhydrous acetone 3-4 times. Remove empty freezing planchets using pre-cooled tweezers (all root segments should be detached from the planchets and free inside in the cryovial with acetone). Remove acetone and add pre-cooled (-60 °C) 30% HM20 solution for at least 3 h. Repeat this step with pre-cooled (-60 °C) 60% HM20 solution (3 h) and 100% HM20 (3 h). At least 3 more changes with 100% HM20 are recommended. During the entire embedding procedures, samples should remained at -60 °C.Assemble embedding chambers by attaching Coverwell® imaging chambers to a glass slide. Fill embedding chambers with fresh 100% HM20 and transfer roots from cryovial to embedding chambers. Cover with a glass coverslip.Polymerize HM20 resin at -50 °C with UW light for 48 h.Once polymerized, remove resin blocks from embedding chambers. Locate roots within resin block with the help of a dissecting microscope.",
    "Cut pieces or resin containing roots and mount them on top of resin stubs using super glue (Figure 3B).With a razor blade trim the resin block around the root. Start sectioning with a glass knife in an ultramicrotome until reaching the root. Switch to a diamond knife; collect 70 nm-thick sections on Formvar coated-nickel grids.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150904/20150904234004_4691.jpgFigure 4.

(2014) Copyright American Society of Plant Biologists.Place 10 μl drops of blocking buffer on a piece of parafilm and float nickel grids on top of drops (the root sections should be in contact with the blocking buffer) for 15-20 min.
