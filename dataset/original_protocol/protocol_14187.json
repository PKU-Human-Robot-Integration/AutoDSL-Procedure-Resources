    "Experiments were performed on male C57BL/6 mice, aged 12 weeks. This study was conducted in compliance with guidelines of the German Animal Law under Protocol TSA 16/2250.\n1. Materials Preparation\nNOTE: All steps are performed under clean, non-sterile conditions. Sterile conditions would be required if animal is to be survived postoperatively.\nIntroduce 3 fenestrations into a 2-Fr polyurethane tube using a surgical blade under a microscope with 16X magnification.\n\tNOTE: All fenestrations must be located in the distal third of the cannula to ensure optimal blood drainage.\nPrepare the priming solution (Materials Table). Include 30 IU/mL heparin and 2.5% v/v of an 8.4% solution of NaHCO3. Refrigerate this solution at 4 °C until it is ready to use. Prime the circuit with 500 uL of priming solution.\nPlace the outflow cannula into the priming solution and fill the ECMO machine by switching on the peristaltic pump. Continue to circulate the priming solution through the machine for the next 30 min at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.\nGive 0.5 L/min of 100% oxygen to the oxygenator.\n2. Anesthesia\nPlace the animal in an induction chamber filled with a 2.5% v/v isoflurane/oxygen mixture. Provide 0.5 L/min of 100% oxygen to the vaporizer. Before surgery, check that full anesthesia is achieved by testing pedal withdrawal and pain reflexes. Apply eye gel to prevent drying damage.\nUse a warming pad to maintain the body temperature at 37 °C.\nPerform inhalation mask anesthesia using an isoflurane vaporizer and inject 5 mg/kg carprofen subcutaneously.\nRegularly observe spontaneous breathing and adjust the concentration of isoflurane so that it is between 1.3 and 2.5%.\n3. Surgery",
    "Expose the left jugular vein by using a lateral skin incision of 4 mm with the help of fine scissors on the left side of the neck. Together with sharp and blunt preparation using micro-forceps and cotton swabs, use bipolar coagulation of the small vessels.\nOnce the left jugular vein is exposed, ligate the distal part using an 8-0 silk suture with the help of micro-forceps.\nPlace a slip knot at the proximal end of the vein. Incise the anterior wall of the vein using micro-scissors.\nTo achieve full heparinization, inject 2.5 IU/g heparin into the jugular vein via a 26 G braunula.\nRaise the head side of the animal pad by 30° to avoid excessive blood loss from the vein during insertion of the cannula.\nInsert a 2-Fr polyurethane (PU) cannula into the proximal part of the jugular vein, rotating it slightly while pushing it to a depth of 4 cm; while doing so, the iliac bifurcation of inferior vena cava (IVC) will be reached.\nSecure the cannula with 8-0 silk knots using microforceps.\nExpose the right jugular vein using the steps described in 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3.\nCannulate the right jugular vein with a 1-Fr PU cannula and gently move it 5 mm towards the direction of right atrium.\nRepeat step 3.7.\nCatheterize the left femoral artery with another 1-Fr PU cannula and use it for invasive pressure monitoring as well as blood sampling for blood gas analysis (BGA).\nInsert electrocardiogram (ECG) needles connected to a data acquisition device subcutaneously into both forelimbs and into the left thoracic wall.\nInsert a rectal thermometer connected to a data acquisition device.\n4. Veno-Venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation and Blood Gas Analysis\nNOTE: For a schematic of the complete ECMO circuit, see Figure 1.",
    "Initiate ECMO on the animal by turning on the pump with an initial flow rate of 0.1 mL/min. Adjust the flow rate of the pump within the next 2 min to 3-5 mL/min.\nIn case of air suction in the outflow cannula via the cannulation site, reduce the flow and add 0.1 mL of priming solution to the circuit via an air-trapping reservoir.\nUnder stable flow, continue to monitor in real-time mode all vital parameters via the data acquisition device.\nConstantly observe backflow from the venous drainage and monitor the level of the blood in the air-trapper reservoir.\nCollect any blood leaking from wounds into a 1 cc syringe with the tip of a 24 G branula andreturn it to the ECMO circuit via the air-trapping reservoir.\nFor BGA, use a blood sampling cartridge to collect approximately 75 µL of arterial blood at the following time points and from the following locations:\n\t\n10 min after the initiation of ECMO, collect blood from the IVC via an extra tube built in before the oxygenator, via similar extra tube after oxygenator (control), and directly from the femoral artery.\n30 min after the initiation of ECMO, collect blood from the femoral artery.\nGive an extra 0.1 mL of priming solution to compensate for intravasal liquid loss every 45 min via the air-trapper or femoral artery catheter or by sucking the air bubbles through the blood draining cannula.\nFor BGA, use a blood sampling cartridge to collect approximately 75 µL of arterial blood:\n\t\n1 h after the initiation of ECMO from the femoral artery.\n2 h after the initiation of ECMO, collect blood from the IVC via an extra tube built in before the oxygenator, via similar extra tube after oxygenator (control), and directly from the femoral artery.",
    "After 2 h, reduce the flow rate on the pump gradually (over the course of 5 min), thereby stopping ECMO.\nContinue to record vital parameters for another 10 min.\nFinish the experiment by exsanguinating the animal and harvesting the blood and organs.\nSubscription Required.
