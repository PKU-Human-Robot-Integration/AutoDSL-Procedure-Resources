    "1. Generation of the E. coli Double Knock Out Mutant with P1 Transduction\nObtain the E. coli single-knockout mutant strains ΔPotE and ΔCadB from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center (http://cgsc.biology.yale.edu[href=http://cgsc.biology.yale.edu]).\nNOTE: The ΔPotE strain is kanamycin resistant26 and the ΔCadB strain is tetracycline resistant27.\nConstruct the PotE/CadB double knockout (DKO) strain using the P1 transduction protocol28.\n\t\nLysate preparation\n\t\t\nDilute an overnight culture of ΔPotE in fresh LB (1:100) supplemented with 10-25 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2, and 0.1-0.2% glucose.\nGrow at 37 °C for 1-2 h.\nAdd 40 µL of P1 phage lysate to the culture, and continue growing at 37 °C. Monitor for 1-3 h until the culture has lysed\n\t\t\tNOTE: When the culture is lysed, cellular debris will be visible in the tube and the culture will have a significant loss of turbidity.\nAdd several drops of chloroform (50-100 µL) to the lysate and vortex. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 2 min to remove cellular debris and transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube.\nTransduction\n\t\t\nGrow ΔCadB strain overnight in LB medium.\nHarvest the cells by centrifugation at 4,000 x g for 2 min and resuspend in 1/5-1/3 the harvested culture volume in fresh LB supplemented with 100 mM MgSO4 and 5 mM CaCl2.\nAdd the ΔCadB cell suspension to the tube with phage from step 1.2.1.4 and mix rapidly.\nAdd 200 µL of 1 M Na-Citrate (pH5.5), then add 1 mL of LB. Incubate at 37 °C for 1 h to allow the expression of the antibiotic resistant marker.\nSpin cells at 4000 x g for 5 min.\nResuspend in 100 µL LB supplemeted with 100 mM Na-Citrate (pH 5.5) and vortex well to disperse cells.",
    "Select the recombinant strains on LB agar plates with 50 µg/mL kanamycin and 10 µg/mL tetracycline and then confirm by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) with appropriate primers26,27.\nVerify the PCR fragments by sequencing.\n2. Expression of the Target Gene (AtBAT1) in E. coli Mutant\nAmplify the full-length sequence of the target gene by PCR and insert into the Gateway entry vector pENTR/D-TOPO29.\nNOTE: In this case ATBAT1.1 was amplified using forward primer 5'CGGCGATCAATCCTTTGTT and reverse primer 5'GCTAAGAATGTTGGAGATGG, an initial denaturation at 98 °C for 2 min and then 30 cycles of denaturation at 98 °C for 0.1 min, annealing at 59 °C for 0.3 min, extension at 72 °C for 0.40 min and final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR product was purified using a PCR cleanup kit, quantified using a spectrometer. Insertion of the PCR product into the Gateway vector was done following the manufactrurers directions.\n\t\nTransform the entry vector into competent Top10 E. coli cells by heatshock and select for successful recombinants on LB media with 50 µg/mL kanamycin following standard molecular cloning protocols30.\nExtract plasmid DNA using a plasmid extraction kit, following the manufacturer's directions, and sequence to confirm the correct insertion.\nTransfer the target gene into the E. coli destination vector, pBAD-DEST49 by Gateway LR cloning to create an expression vector29.\n\t\nTransform the expression vector into competent Top10 E. coli cells by heatshock for 30 s and select successful recombinants on LB media with 100 µg/mL ampicillin30.\nExtract plasmid DNA30 and sequence to confirm the correct insertion.\nTransform expression vector into E. coli ΔpotE740(del)::kan, ΔcadB2231::Tn10 and select on LB plates with ampicillin, kanamycin, and tetracycline30.",
    "In order to determine the optimal concentration of arabinose for induction, express the target gene under the control of the araBAD promoter in LB media with gradient concentrations of arabinose as described29.\nCollect the cell pellets and assess protein expression by SDS-PAGE and visualization of protein bands as described in the product manual29.\nNOTE: The E. coli ΔpotE740(del)::kan, ΔcadB2231::Tn10 was used as the control sample without BAT1 expression. E.coli double knock out mutant cells with the empty pBAD-DEST49 vector was not used as a control due to the presence of the ccdB gene in the vector.\n3. Generation of Inside-out Membrane Vesicles\nCulture the E. coli mutant cells expressing the target protein by growing a single colony overnight in 5 mL of polyamine-free media (2% glycerol, 6 g of K2HPO4, 3 g of KH2PO4, 0.5 g of NaCl, NH4Cl, 50 mg of thiamine, 0.79 g yeast complete synthetic media adenine hemisulfate (10 mg/L), L-Arginine (50 mg/L), L-Aspartic acid (80 mg/L), L-Histidine hydrochloride monohydrate (20 mg/L), L-Leucine (100 mg/L), L-Lysine hydrochloride (50 mg/L), L-Methionine (20 mg/L), L-Phenylalanine (50 mg/L), L-Threonine (100 mg/L), L-Tryptophan (50 mg/L), L-Tyrosine (50 mg/L), L-Valine (140 mg/L), Uracil (20 mg/L)). Transfer this culture to 500 mL of polyamine-free media supplemented with 0.0002% arabinose and grow until the cell culture reaches an OD600 of 0.6-0.8 (usually ~5 h).\nCollect the cell pellet by centrifugation at 2,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. Resuspend the pellet and wash three times with 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.6, containing 10 mM EDTA (Buffer 1). The final volume of cells in Buffer 1 after the third spin should be 10 mL.\nGenerate inside-out membrane vesicles by French Press treatment (10,000 p.s.i.) of the intact cells using a 35 mL French pressure Cell.",
    "Prior to loading the sample into the standard French pressure cell, lubricate the piston and O-rings to make it easier to insert into the cell.\nNOTE: These instructions are specific for the use of the standard pressure cell31.\n\t\nCarefully screw the closure plug into the lower end of the cell. Ensure that the cell is right-side up based on the lettering on the side of the cell. Insert the piston into the cell and move it into the cell, until the max fill line on the piston reach the top of the piston. Flip the unit over and place on the provided stand between the three posts.\nPour the cell suspension into the body of the cell.\nNOTE: We have been using only 10 mL, so there will be plenty of room left in the French pressure cell chamber, which has a capacity of 35 mL.\nMount the standard pressure cell on the French pressure cell unit.\n\t\t\nFirst check that the power is off. On the left side of the panel is the Ratio Selector switch. It has three positions: Down at the end of the run, Low for using a smaller pressure cell, and High for use with the standard French pressure cell. If the French press was previously used with the smaller cell the piston may not be fully retracted. Set this switch to Down.\nTurn the machine on with the switch on the RHS at the back of the unit and turn the Pause-Run switch to the Run position. This will result in the piston being fully retracted. Move the switch back to Pause, and shut the machine off.",
    "Loosen the thumb screws and move the safety clamp that spans to two stainless steel columns to the side. It will swing out to the right. With one hand holding the base of the closure plug in place, pick the French pressure cell up with both hands, and rotate it 180°, so the piston is now in the upright position. Set it onto the platform, and move the safety clamp back in place so that this clamp holds the French pressure cell in position.\nNote the Flow Valve assembly on the closure plug needs to be accessible to the operater and positioned so that the valve can be turned freely. Open the the flow valve assembly with a few counter clockwise turns. Position the the arms of the piston so that they are oriented in a two o'clock and eight o'clock position. Tighten the thumbs screws so that the standard pressure cell is held in place.\nInsert the Sample outlet tube into the closure plug, and connect a short piece of flexible tubing so that the broken cell debris can be collected in a falcon tube. We usually use an 300 mL ice-filled beaker to hold the falcon tube upright, and to keep the cell debris chilled.\nMake sure the Pause-Run switch is set to Pause, and the valve assembly is in the open position. Turn the machine back to on, adust the Ratio Selector switch to High, and turn the Pressure Increase Valve on the front panel to the right about a half turn.\nThe piston will begin to rise from the base to displace the air in chamber. Direct the air coming out of the Tygon tubing attached to the sample outlet tube to the tube in the beaker.",
    "When the first drops of liquid come out, close the the flow valve assembly by turning it clockwise. This creates a metal to metal seal, with the pressure cell, so do not overtighten.\nThe front of the French Press has a chart on the front panel to generate the proper pressure on the biological cells inside the pressure cell. In this case, increase the pressure by turning the Pressure Increase Valve clockwise, until the Gauge reaches 640 psi. This will create an internal pressure of 10,000 psi.\nOnce the cell has reached target pressure open the flow valve assembly slightly by turning it counter clockwise. Adjust the the opening of the valve to allow a flow rate of only about 10 drops per min.\nWhen the stop line on the piston body reaches the top of the flow cell. Switch the Pause-Run Switch to Pause. This is critical because having the piston inserted farther into the cell will damage the unit. Open the flow valve assembly and collect the remaining drops.\nTurn Ratio Selector switch to Down, and then set the Pause Run switch to Run. When the bottom plate is fully retracted set the Run switch to Pause, and turn the machine off.\nRemove the French pressure cell from the French press, and disassemble for cleaning. Store all parts dry with a light covering of glycerol. Remove and replace any gaskets or seals with signs of wear.\nRemove unbroken cells and cell debris of the French press eluent by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. Discard the pellet, and transfer supernatant to ultracentrifuge tubes.\nPellet membrane vesicles from the resulting supernatant by ultracentrifugationat 150,000 g for 1 h at 4 °C.",
    "Wash the membrane vesicles once, without resuspension, in 1 mM Tris-maleate, pH 5.2 containing 0.14 M KCl, 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 10% glycerol and resuspend in the same buffer (Buffer 2)23 using a Dounce tissue grinder. Typically the membrane fraction from 500 mL of culture would be suspended in 5 mL of buffer, and a concentration of 5-10 mg of membrane protein/mL using the Biochinic Acid assay32.\nStore 100 µL aliquots of membrane preparations at -80 °C in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\n4. Western Blot and Orientation of Transporter Assay\nWash and resuspend vesicles from step 3.7 in 30 mM Tris pH 7.8 + 0.1 mM CoCl2.\nTo 100 µL samples, add 1 µL of 2 mg/mL carboxypeptidase A in 0.1 M NaCl, 30 mM Tris, 0.2 mM CoCl2 pH 7.8.\nInculate for 20 min at 20 °C. Stop digestion by adding 5 µL of 0.5 M NaEDTA, 0.5 M 2-mercaptoethanol pH 7.5.\nTo fully inactivate the enzyme, incubate the solution for 1 h at room temperature.\nNOTE: Vesicles without the catboxypeptidase A treatment were used as a control.\nAnalyze samples by electrophoresis in the presence of lithium dodecyl sulfate. Add 5-10 µL of 150 mg/mL lithium dodecyl sulfate, 450 mg/mL glycerol, 0.1 mg/mL bromophenol blue, 0.4 M Tris pH 7.5 to 100 µL of sample.\nPerform immunoblotting by laying a nitrocellulose filter moistened with 25 mM sodium-hydrogen phosphate pH 7.5 upon the polyacrylamide gel. Place these between two moistened cellulose filters and finally between two moistened plastic scouring pads. Place this assemblage between the electrodes of a chamber containing 25 mM sodium-hydrogen phosphate pH 7.5 at 2-4 °C.\nAllow electrotransfer of proteins to proceed for 3 h at 20 V and 2-3 A.",
    "Block the nitrocellulose membrane overnight at 2 °C in a blocking buffer of 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5 and 0.5 mg/mL Tween 2033.\nIncubate the nitrocellulose filter for 2 h with a 1:5000 dilution of Anti-His (C terminal)-HRP antibody in the blocking buffer (20 mL) and wash twice with 50 mL of buffer for a total of 60 min.\nTo visualize the immunoblot, dissolve 6 mg of 4-chloro-1-naphthol in 20 mL of denatured alcohol and add 80 mL of 15 mM Tris pH 7.5 and 50 µL of 30% H2O2. Bathe the filter paper in the substrate solution for 20 min. The reagent will react with the antibody to form a blue precipitate on the nitrocellulose membrane. When sufficient color has developed, rinse the membrane with water, and allow to dry.\n5. Transport Assay\nIncubate 100 μL aliquots of membrane vesicles at 12 °C for 5 min.\nInitiate transport by adding radiolabeled polyamines to the membrane vesicles at a final concentration of 50 µM (unless otherwise stated). Make 3H-substrate (spermidine or putrescine) solutions in an assay buffer consisting of 10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 8.0 and 0.14 M KCl23 (Buffer 3) with modifications depending on the assay.\nConduct transport assays for 1 min at 12 °C in 1.5 mL microfuge tubes.\nAfter 1 min, transfer the reaction mixtures to filtration manifold and filter through a 0.45 µm nitrocellulose membrane filter.\n\t\nAdd 3 mL of ice-cold assay buffer containing a 10-fold higher concentration of unlabeled polyamines followed by 3 mL of assay buffer without the polyamines to reduce nonspecific binding.",
    "Transfer the washed filters to 20 mL disposable scintillation vials containing 10 mL of scintillation liquid and determine radioactivity by using a liquid scintillation counter. The scintillation counter measures the radioactivity in the sample and reports it as disintegrations per min (dpm).\nCalculate the net polyamine uptake as the difference between the uptake at 1 min by vesicles incubated at 12 °C and uptake at 0 min by vesicles incubated on ice.\nNOTE: The mass of substrate imported into the vesicles is calculated as follows. If the sample volume in the microfuge tube is 0.2 µL and the starting concentration of substrate is 100 µM, then the total mass of substrate in the microfuge tube is 20 x 10-12 M. Because of the very high specific activity of commercially labelled substrates (often 2.22 x 109 dpm/mM) the mass of the isotope added can be ignored in the calculation. So if the total amount of isotope that was added to the microfuge tube was 100 x 106 dpm and the vesicles had a net uptake of 1,000 dpm, then the total mass of substrate taken up by the vesicles was 1% of the total number of moles of substrate or 2 x 10-13 M.\n\t\nDetermine Km for the substrate by measuring the uptake of 10, 25, 50, 250 and 500 μM radiolabeled substrate into vesicles expressing the target protein. Calculate Michaelis-Menten kinetics using a nonlinear regression method using the Michaelis Menton model of the statistical software package34.\nFor the competition experiments, add 100 μM, 500 μM, 1 mM, 1.5 mM or 2 mM nonlabelled competitive substrate made in the assay buffer to the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing 100 µL of vesicles at 12 °C.\n\t\nAdd radiolabeled polyamine (50 µM) to the microcentrifuge tube simultaneously.",
    "Measure radioactivity trapped inside vesicles as mentioned above by repeating steps 5 through 5.4.2.\nDetermine apparent Km (Km,app) for the competitive substrates by measuring the uptake of 10, 25, 50, 250 and 500 μM radiolabeled polyamines in the presence of 100 μM or higher nonlabelled substrate and using a nonlinear regression method to plot the curve.\nSubscription Required.
