  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: This protocol begins after one has isolated mitochondria from red skeletal muscle. Mitochondria were isolated as previously described from ~ 75 - 100 mg of red skeletal muscle13. Between 5 - 10 µg/µl of mitochondrial protein will be attained from this amount of tissue by resuspending the final mitochondrial pellet in ≤50 µl of isolation buffer for mitochondria (IBM) 2 (See Frisard et al13).\n1. Setup\nPrepare working stock solutions (Table 1) and mitochondrial assay solution (MAS) mixes (Table 2) for subsequent assays.\n\tNote: Most of the preparation for the assays can be done in advance as most stocks solutions and MAS can be stored.\nHydrate a respirometric assay cartridge in 1 ml calibration solution the night before the experiment in a non-CO2 incubator at 37 °C.\nThe day of the experiment, take out frozen stocks (substrates and mitochondrial modulators, MAS mix, MAS w/o BSA, Table 1) and thaw in 37 °C bath or incubator.\nPrepare all substrate solutions (Table 3) and injections (Table 4-5) and adjust pH as desired (pH 7.4). After the pH is adjusted, store on ice.\nProgram the multi-well oxygen consumption measurement machine to proper mix, wait, and measure parameters (See Table 6) and label background and group/condition wells by first entering the analysis software, followed by the “Standard” mode.\n\t\nEnter into the “Guest” forum and click on the “Assay Wizard”. Once in the “Assay Wizard”, click on “Protocol” to change mix, wait, and measure parameters. Label the background wells under the “Back. Correction” tab and be sure to highlight “Do background correction”.\nLabel conditions by first clicking on the “Groups & Labels” tab, followed by the “Group Info” tab. After these parameters are entered, click “End”, followed by “Save Template”.\n2. The Assay Run",
    "Load the injection solutions into an assay run cartridge and start the calibration by first entering the analysis software, followed by entering the “Standard” mode. Enter into the “Guest” forum. Open the template saved in Step 1.5 under the “XF” drive, under the “Templates” tab. Once open, click “Start” to begin calibration.\n\tNote: The assay run cartridge must be entered into the machine with the notched corner to the bottom left. This takes about 30 min. Take care to inject solutions into the proper ports. Injections in Table 4-5 are listed in order of loading.\nGently, but thoroughly mix the mitochondria stock by stirring the solution with a 200 µl pipette tip, followed by gently triturating the stock with a 200 µl pipette tip that has had its orifice widened by cutting ~ 3 mm off the end of the tip with scissors.\nPerform a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay to determine the protein concentration of the mitochondrial stock.\nUsing the stock concentration acquired from step 2.3, resuspend 10 µg of mitochondrial protein/200 µl of the succinate/ rotenone substrate mix (Table 3). Resuspend 14 µg of mitochondrial protein/ 200 µl of the remaining substrate mixes (This must be done for each substrate mix) (Table 3). Place all mitochondrial protein/substrate mixes on ice.\n\tNote: The optimal amount of mitochondrial protein per well for each assay was determined as previously described9. It was determined that the pyruvate /malate, palmitoyl carnitine/malate, glutamate/malate and electron flow assays utilizes 3.5 µg of mitochondrial protein, while the succinate/rotenone assay utilizes 2.5 µg of mitochondrial protein per well. Therefore, the researcher needs to resuspend enough mitochondrial protein for 4 replicates in this step since either 2.5 µg or 3.5 µg per 50 µl is loaded per well (See step 2.6).",
    "Mix the mitochondria/ substrate solutions gently, but thoroughly by stirring the solution with a 200 µl pipette tip, followed by gently triturating the stock with a 200 µl pipette tip that has had ~ 3 mm of its end cut off.\nPlace a cell culture plate on ice and in triplicate, load 50 µl/well of each of the mitochondria/substrate mixes. The developers of the microplate based respirometric assay recommend leaving a minimum of two blank (no mitochondria) wells, preferably on either side on the cell culture plate.\nSpin the cell culture plate at 2,000 g for 20 min at 4 °C. While the plate is spinning, warm up the substrate solutions in a 37 °C water bath.\nAfter the spin is complete, carefully load 450 µl of each substrate solution on top of its respective wells (i.e., load the pyruvate/malate substrate to the wells that have mitochondria initially resuspended in this substrate solution). Be sure to load the plate at RT. Note: Blank wells should be loaded with 500 µl of substrate. Blank wells designated for the electron flow assay should be loaded with the electron flow substrate (Pyruvate/Malate + FCCP), while the coupled assay blank wells can be loaded with any coupling assay substrate.\n\tNote: If performing the coupled and electron flow assays on the same plate, the researcher must reassign background wells to the respective assays after the assay run is complete using the “XF Reader” platform via the “Instrument” tab. Once within the “Instrument” setting, click on the “Administration” tab, followed by “Background Correction”. Hit “End Instrument Setup Mode” when complete. This is because the combination of ascorbate/TMPD can consume O2, thus a separate background correction is needed for each assay type.",
    "After the 450 µl of substrate is added to each well, view the layer of mitochondria in the well to ensure the mitochondria are dispersed evenly in a single monolayer (20X magnification [See Rogers9, Figure 4]). Wells that do not appear to have an evenly distributed monolayer can be removed post hoc.\nAfter checking for mitochondrial adherence, insert the microplate into the respirometric assay instrument and start the assay run by clicking “OK”.\n\tNote: The calibration from step 2.1 must be complete before the run will begin. Once the researcher clicks “OK”, the machine will eject the utility plate that was used for calibration.\n\t\nRemove the utility plate and place the cell culture plate that contains the mitochondria on the tray. The blue notch on the cell culture plate should be placed in the bottom left corner of the tray. Click on, “continue” to start the assay run.\nAfter the run is complete, eject the cell culture plate and cartridge by pressing “Eject” on the screen.\n\t\nOnce the plate is ejected, remove and discard the cell culture plate and cartridge and click “Continue” on the screen. The run will be automatically saved as an .xls file in the “Data” file.\nOpen this file and change the display from “O2” to “OCR” by hitting the downward arrow under the “Y1:” marker.\n\t\nNext change “Middle Point” to “Point-to-Point Rates” under the “Rate Data Displayed As:” option. Click “OK” to apply these changes.\nClick the “Well Group Mode” tab on bottom left of the screen to group wells of similar conditions together. Finally, click the “Sample Mean/Standard Error” tab toward the middle of the screen, to the left. Alternatively, these commands can be setup before the assay begins in the “Assay Wizard” setting.",
    "Note: Each condition will have a mean ± standard deviation displayed for each rate and each condition. There are rate measurements taken per condition (State 2[Coupling]/State3u [Electron Flow] respiration followed by four injections). Use the mean of the State 2 rate of the second measurement, determine State 4o at the minimum point after oligomycin injection, use the maximum point for State 3 and State 3u after ADP and FCCP injection, respectively, and use the minimum point for Antimycin A induced respiration for the Coupling Assays. Use the maximum point for pyruvate/malate induced State 3u respiration, use the minimum point for rotenone induced respiration, use the maximum point for succinate induced State 3u respiration, and use the minimum point for Antimycin A induced respiration for the Electron Flow assay. All experiments were performed 3 times and the data shown are the results of a representative tracing."
