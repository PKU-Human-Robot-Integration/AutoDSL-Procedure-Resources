    "Collection of olfactory mucosa tissueA fresh sample (diameter of 4 mm) was obtained endoscopically from the superior turbinate tissue of a patient under general anesthesia.This study was approved by the Ethical Commission of the Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Before operation, a signed written consent was given by the patient.There is no age limitation for providing fresh sample in this study.After coordination with an Ear Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon, the olfactory mucosa tissue was placed in a 15 ml tube containing 5 ml cold HBSS with 10% antibiotics (Antibiotic-antimycotic).Olfactory mucosa tissue was delivered to the lab on dry ice.Isolation of OECs from olfactory mucosaWash the olfactory mucosa tissue 3 times with 5 ml cold PBS each time. Incubate the olfactory mucosa tissue in 1 ml dispase II solution (2.4 IU/ml), for 1 h at 37 °C.Dissect lamina propria from the olfactory epithelium using a micro spatula under an inverted light microscope. Lamina propria is the thick orange layer and epithelium is the thin translucent gray layer. Cut the lamina propria into small pieces.Transfer the pieces to a new 15 ml Falcon tube containing 1 ml of collagenase IA and incubate for 20 min at 37 °C.Inactivate collagenase IA by adding 9 ml of PBS into the tube.Centrifuge the suspension at 250 x g for 5 min.Resuspend the resulting pellet in 1 ml of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)/F12 medium supplemented with neuronal growth factor (NGF, 50 ng/ml), 1% (100 U/ml) antibiotic-antimycotic. Transfer the suspension containing tiny pieces of tissue into two T25 flasks containing 5 ml of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)/F12 medium supplemented with neuronal growth factor (NGF, 50 ng/ml), 1% (100 U/ml) antibiotic-antimycotic each.Incubate in an incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity for 3-4 weeks.Change culture medium every 3 days.",
    "Note: After 14 days culture of human olfactory lamina propria, OECs are released from periphery of spherical clusters. The morphology of most cells is spindle-shaped and bipolar with long processes and small cytoplasm or multipolar form with short processes and plentiful cytoplasm such as stellate morphology. Note that there may be fibroblast contamination in lamina propria culture. Fibroblast morphology is also spindle-shaped and bipolar with long processes. (Figures 1 and 2)After 3-4 weeks, OECs are ready for subculture.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170515/20170515181635_4703.jpgFigure 1.

OECs after first passage. Scale bar = 100 µm.Sub-culture of primary OECs of olfactory mucosa lamina propriaCheck the confluency of OECs under an inverted microscope. Subculture the cells when the cell density reaches 80% confluence 3-4 weeks after seeding.Remove the medium from each T25 flask under a biological hood with a 5 ml sterile pipette.Wash the cells with 3 ml of warm (37 °C) PBS and then remove PBS. Trypsinize the cells with 1 ml of warm (37 °C) 0.05% trypsin-EDTA for 1 min in an incubator at 37 °C.Stop trypsin-EDTA reaction by adding 4 ml of DMEM/F12 containing 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic into each T25 flask and then transfer the cell suspension from each flask to a 15 ml Falcon tube. Centrifuge the cell suspension at 250 x g for 5 min at room temperature.Remove the medium from each tube with a 5 ml sterile pipette.",
    "Resuspend the pellet in each tube with 1 ml of fresh medium containing DMEM/F12, 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic.After re-suspend and counting, seed the cells into a 24-well dish (at a density of 5 x 103 cells per well) for immunocytochemistry (go to step D2) and into T25 flasks (5 x 106 cells in flask) for subculture.Subculture the T25 flasks containing OECs in (DMEM)/F12 medium containing 10% FBS and 1% (100 U/ml) antibiotic-antimycotic in the incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity for 4-5 days. (Figure 2)ImmunocytochemistrySeed 5 x 103 cells into each well of a 24-well culture dish.Wash each well three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) after 24 h at room temperature.Fix cells with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min.Wash cells three times in PBS at room temperature for 5 min each.Permeate cell membranes with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min.Wash cells three times in PBS at room temperature for 5 min each.Block cells with 10% bovine serum albumin for 1 h.Dilute the primary antibody of rabbit anti-S100-beta 1:100 in 1% BSA in PBS.Wash cells three times in PBS at room temperature for 5 min each.Dilute the secondary antibody of FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit 1:500 in 1% BSA in PBS.Incubate cells with secondary antibody of FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit for 2 h at room temperature in the dark.Wash cells three times in PBS at room temperature for 5 min each.Image cells by an inverted fluorescence microscopy (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170515/20170515185033_9973.jpgFigure 3.
