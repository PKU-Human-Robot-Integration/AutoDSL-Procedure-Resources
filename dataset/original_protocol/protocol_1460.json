    "Step by step method details\nStep by step method details\nPart 1: Budding yeast cell culture, treatment, and chromatin isolation\nTiming: 2 days\nBudding yeast cell culture, synchronization, and DNA damage treatment\nGrow 2 L of the desired MATa budding yeast strain for 14–16 h (h) in YPAD media at 30°C until logarithmic growth phase (OD600= 0.4–0.6, equivalent to 5 × 106 cells/mL). See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] for workflow of the protocol. We used 1 l per treatment per strain analyzed, thus from a 2 L synchronized culture one derives one treated sample and one control (Challa et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1004-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Workflow for sucrose gradient chromatin enrichment for mass spectrometry protocol\nSee text for details. Part of this figure is reprinted with permission from Challa et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1].\nSpin the cells, 2000 × g, 5 min, wash 1x with 50 mL H2O and replace with 2 L fresh YPAD containing alpha factor (1 mL, 1:2000, stock 5 mg/mL). The appropriate alpha factor dose varies among strains, thus the optimal amount for G1 arrest by 60–90 min, such that the culture has <10% budded cells (bud emergence correlates with entrance into S phase), should be determined ahead of time.\nNote: if comparing two strains, it is important that they synchronize similarly, as pheromone induces a physiological mating program. If one strain forms shmoos and the other does not (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A), this will affect gene expression and the proteome. The goal of synchronization is to achieve 90% arrest at G1 with no small buds, without inducing shmoo formation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1004-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Reproducibility and chromatin enrichment measurements",
    "(A) Sketch of successful alpha factor arrest and inappropriate shmoo formation, which is indicative of too much alpha factor. Shown below are representative light microscope images of alpha factor arrested cells before and after incubation with nonionic detergent, which lyses spheroplasts (wild-type background).\n(B) Flow cytometry (FACS) analysis of cell cycle stages for a wild-type background.\n(C) Coomassie blue stained SDS-PAGE of WT chromatin fractionated sample showing whole cell extract (WCE), supernatant (SUP), 0 and 8 0min formaldehyde cross-linked, Wash fraction, Chromatin fraction and recombinant histone H3+H4 mix (1μg). Fractions and volumes loaded are shown on top of the gel.\n(D) Reproducibility among normalized chromatome (C) samples of the indicated yeast strains (for full genotype see Challa et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) in Undamaged (UD) and Damaged (D) TMT 9plex samples. The samples a, b, c, for each condition (UD or D) are separate biological replicates of one strain.\n(E) Correlation plot for chromatome components vs total proteome components. All DNA binding proteins (highlighted in green; 96%) are enriched in the chromatome, as are histones (highlighted in purple). This validates our purification protocol. Panels C, D and E of Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] are reprinted with permission from Challa et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1].\nIncubate the cultures with shaking at 25°C for 60 min and add another full dose of alpha factor (1 mL). Incubate a further 40 min (check by light microscopy for arrest without new buds) and collect the samples for FACS analysis before and after alpha factor arrest to confirm cell cycle stage (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).",
    "Split the synchronized cells into two 1 L cultures and start treatment by adding Zeocin® to final concentration 300 μg/mL to one culture only and incubate a further 60 min at 25°C. The control should receive an equal volume of the solvent minus Zeocin®. Collect 10 mL samples for Western blot analysis before and after Zeocin® treatment to check the DNA damage status. This can be done with antibodies that identify DNA damage-induced markers such as phosphorylated Rad53 or γH2A (see Western blot sample collection and processing below). Other DNA damaging agents can be used. For instance, cells can be released from alpha factor-containing media into 0.2M hydroxyurea, to monitor replication fork arrest induced changes in chromatin (Hurst et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5], in revision). Cell cycle progression should be comparable. Check by FACS and microscopy.\nSpin down cells at 25°C; 2000 × g, 5 min and wash 1× with 50 mL PBS (2000 × g, 3 min spin).\nNote: Avoid storing pellets in −80°C and continue the next steps on same day for better yield of proteins.\nSpheroplasting and cell lysis\nTiming: 1 h\nResuspend cells in 45 mL Buffer B. Incubate at 22°C–25°C (room temperature) slowly shaking/rotating for 10 min in 50 mL Falcon® tube or equivalent. The sodium azide (NaN3) in the buffer will kill the cells.\nSpin down 2000 × g for 2 min and resuspend thoroughly in 20 mL Buffer C in a 50 mL Falcon tube.",
    "Add 750 μL Zymolyase® T100 stock (20 mg/mL in H2O – final concentration about 0.75 mg/mL) and incubate at 30°C shaking very slowly for 15–20 min. Invert the tubes every 5 min, and check for efficient spheroplasting by mixing a 1:1 ratio of sample and E Buffer +0.5% TritonX-100. Observe under a light microscope for the percentage of lysed vs unlysed cells (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) to determine when spheroplasting is complete (>80%–90% of cells should lyse).\nSpin down spheroplasts at 1500 × g, 2 min at 4°C, and wash in 10 mL of 4°C spheroplast wash buffer (SW buffer) carefully dislodging the pellet with a cut pipet tip or a rubber tipped baton. Spin down at 1500 × g, 2 min, and wash one more time with 10 mL chilled SW buffer.\nResuspend spheroplasts without very extensive pipetting in 3 mL of E buffer that lacks TritonX-100.\nAdd 5–8 mL of E Buffer +0.5% TritonX-100 so that final volume is 10 mL and mix on ice by inversion. Lyse for approximately 5 min. Check the cell lysis under the microscope (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Keep 1 × 100 μL and 1 × 500 μL of total cell extract for Western blot and mass spec analysis, respectively.\nCritical: Thorough resuspension of cells prior to spheroplasting and a thorough but gentle resuspension of spheroplasts in wash buffer using cut pipet tip / rubber capped pasture pipet to avoid unequal suspension or premature lysis, are important. Both may lead to chromatin-bound protein loss.\nChromatin fractionation and cross-linking\nTiming: 2–3 h\nOverlay the total lysis mixture on 5 mL of 30% sucrose in E buffer +0.25% TritonX-100 (with 1.5% formaldehyde final concentration) in an Ultra Clear Beckman Coulter 14 mL tube.",
    "Spin at 11100 rpm (21875 × g) for 15 min at 4°C in a Beckman Coulter SW40 Ti swinging bucket rotor.\nKeep 100 μL and 1 mL samples of supernatant (above the sucrose cushion) for Western blotting and mass spectrometry analysis (if necessary).\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend pellet gently in 5 mL of E buffer +0.25% TritonX-100 with 1% final formaldehyde concentration (diluted from 37% stock or use freshly dissolved para-formaldehyde, see Reagent preparation).\nTransfer to a 5 mL Eppendorf tube and incubate for 60 min at 4°C rotating slowly.\nNote: take samples for different crosslinking time points here: 50 μL at 0 min, 30 min, and 60 min, and again after a further 25 min at 22°C–25°C (85 min), see next step (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C)\nPlace the tube at 22°C–25°C and incubate for another 25 min on a rolling device (= 85 min sample)\nAdd 250 μL of 2.5 M glycine (125 mM final concentration) and incubate for 10 min to quench the crosslinking reaction\nSpin 14000 × g for 15 min at 4°C (if desired, keep 500 μL of wash fraction to determine chromatin loss by Western blot for histones or calculation of genomic DNA lost) and discard supernatant.\nFor subsequent steps, resuspend chromatin pellet carefully, but completely, in a final volume of 4 mL TEE buffer, in a 5 mL Eppendorf tube\nRNase digestion and urea washes\nTiming: 1–2 h\nTo each sample add RNaseA (100x stock) to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/mL and incubate for 20 min at 37°C.\nNote: keep 100 μL before and after addition of RNaseA to check for proper RNA digestion by Qubit® RNA detection kit\nSpin 14000 × g for 5 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.",
    "Resuspend pellet carefully (using cut pipette tip) but fully in 0.5 mL TEE buffer + 2% SDS.\nAdd 1.5 mL urea buffer (freshly prepared 8M urea stock in TEE) and mix thoroughly by inverting the tube several times.\nSpin 14000 × g for 5 min at 22°C–25°C (keep 500 μL of supernatant for analysis “Urea wash” (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C) and discard supernatant.\nRepeat washes twice (first in 0.5 mL TEE buffer + 2% SDS then 1.5 mL TEE + urea)\nTo wash out the urea, resuspend in 2 mL TEE buffer + 2% SDS.\nNote: try to be fast with the urea washes and do not allow the sample to go above 25°C as urea causes protein carbamylation.\nSpin 14000 × g for 5 min at 22°C–25°C , discard supernatant.\nAdd 1.5 mL TEE buffer and only flick tube, do not pipet up and down. Spin 14000 × g for 5 min at 22°C–25°C, discard supernatant.\nDissolve the chromatin pellet in 200–300 μL of TEE. Take aliquot of 20 μL, and at this point flash freeze the main chromatin samples in liquid nitrogen and store at −80°C for use in TMT labeling steps described below.\nHeat the 20 μL aliquot to 95°C for 15 min to reverse crosslinking for Western blot analysis and protein concentration determination.\nTCA precipitate (Koontz, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) the heated aliquot and resuspend in 20 μL (20 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5 + 4 M urea). Then measure whole protein content using the Qubit® Protein assay kit using BSA as standards (expected concentrations range from 2.5–5 μg/ μL).\nPart 2: Isobaric peptide labeling using the PreOmics iST-NHS kit and tandem mass tag (TMT) reagents and analysis\nStarting material",
    "This labeling protocol assumes that the desired amount of peptides after pooling all TMT-labeled samples (see below) is roughly 500–750 μg, or 50–75 μg per TMT channel, sufficient for single shot LC-MS/MS analysis and offline basic pH reversed-phase fractionation. The PreOmics iST-NHS kit is compatible with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester-based amine-reactive isobaric reagents due to the lack of primary amine-containing components and by using 2-chloro-N-N′-diethylacetamide for cysteine alkylation. iST kit protocols and components can be found on the PreOmics website https://www.preomics.com/resources[href=https://www.preomics.com/resources]. The original publication regarding iST kits is (Kulak et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nLysis and benzonase treatment\nTiming: 1–2 h\nTake an aliquot of 100–150 μg chromatin sample, sediment by centrifugation and resuspend and dissolve in 100 μL of PreOmics LYSE NHS component\nHeat the chromatin samples at 95°C (to reverse crosslinking) for 15 min.\nAdd 2 μL Benzonase (stock: 250 U/μL) and digest while shaking slowly for 20 min at 37°C.\nSonicate the chromatin samples in Bioruptor® at 4°C for 10 min, 30 s ON, 30 s OFF, with maximal power settings.\nSpin 300 × g for 10 s at 22°C–25°C to recover vaporized droplets.\nPlace half (50 μL) of the sample into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. The sample should be around 50–75 μg of protein. Keep the rest of the sample in −80°C as reserve.\nNote: if desired, measure the protein content again using the Qubit Protein assay.\nDigestion and labeling (using PreOmics iST-NHS kit and buffers therein)\nTiming: 6–12 h",
    "Any sample-to-sample variability in protein concentrations, buffer composition, digestion, labeling, quenching, mixing, desalting or storage of each sample can result in artifacts of the proteomic analysis. We assume equal amounts of protein input, of similar composition, all in the same sample buffer, for digestion, to ensure comparable peptide amounts and reagent-to-analyte ratios. By using commercial reagent kits and performing steps of the protocol for each sample in parallel, using original reagent and solvent vials, many issues can be avoided. It is advised to build thorough quality checks into the protocol. Digestion and labeling steps are performed for all samples in separate plastic tubes using PreOmics iST-NHS kit components. Tandem-Mass-Tag (TMT) reagents are sensitive to hydrolysis. To avoid reduced labeling efficiency, store TMT reagents in a closed zip-bag with desiccant, equilibrate bag to 22°C–25°C before opening, and use TMT solutions immediately for labeling. We use a TMT reagent to peptide ratio of 4:1, as recommended by PreOmics, with a ratio of acetonitrile:aqueous buffer volume of 41:100 (> 40% anhydrous organic solvent). For example, one vial of 0.2 mg TMT10plex reagent is sufficient to label 50 ug of peptides.",
    "As a recommended quality check for digestion, an aliquot of each sample should be quenched, desalted and analyzed using the Pierce peptide quantification assay (Thermo Fisher), and through a single shot LC-MS/MS analysis to assess sample complexity and total amounts, as evident from the MS chromatograms and base peak signal intensities. Digestion and labeling efficiency can be assessed in a database search by allowing up to 3 enzyme missed cleavages and variable TMT modifications. We usually observe around 90% of peptide-to-spectrum matches in a whole cell extract proteomic experiment with no missed cleavages. In budding yeast chromatome samples, which are dominated by histone peptide identifications which have a significantly higher arginine and lysine content than whole cell extract samples, we commonly observe more missed cleavages; this number was frequently found to be between 60% and 80%. When searching for fixed TMT lysine modifications (all lysines are assumed to be TMT labeled), but variable TMT modification on peptide N-termini (either TMT labeled or unlabeled), the fraction of unmodified peptide N-termini of all confidently identified peptide-to spectrum matches in the experiment in percentage provides an estimate of the TMT labeling efficiency. We generally aim for TMT labeling efficiencies >99%. It is also common to mix equal amounts of aliquots of all TMT labeled samples intended to be used for a multiplex experiment prior to a quality control analysis by LC-MS, and check the same QC parameters as above, including the quantification of TMT reporter ion intensities. By generating boxplots for all TMT abundance channels and/or summing all non-normalized TMT abundances per channel, issues of sample loading or mixing errors for individual samples can be spotted easily as outliers and corrected by adjusting sample amounts in the pooling step. After pooling of TMT-labeled samples we use PreOmics cartridges for peptide purification.",
    "Carefully document the desired experimental design by labeling tubes with sample names and TMT channel names (126, 127N, 127C, etc.). One should keep track of TMT reagent lot numbers.",
    "Add 210 μL of PreOmics RESUSPEND to PreOmics DIGEST and shake (500 rpm, 10 min, 22°C–25°C).\nAdd 50 μL of this mixture to each protein sample tube and place it in a pre-heated heating block (37°C, 500 rpm; 8 h).\nNote: keep the lysis buffer and digestion buffer volume ratio to 1:1.\nNote: we performed 8 h digestion for convenience (end of the day), but according to the PreOmics protocol 3 h digestion is sufficient.\nAdd 41 μL of anhydrous acetonitrile to each TMT label until dissolved.\nTo each of the digested protein samples, add one of the dissolved TMT reagents of your choice and, incubate while shaking (22°C–25°C ; 1 h).\nAdd 2 μL of 50% hydroxylamine to each sample tube and mix to quench the labeling reaction.\nAdd 100 μL of PreOmics STOP to each sample and shake (500 rpm, 1 min, 22°C–25°C).\nNote: in this sample acidification step, a precipitate may be observed, turning the sample slightly cloudy.\nPool all the labeled samples for TMT-multiplexing into a single tube, vortex and centrifuge briefly to remove any precipitate.\nPeptide sample desalting\nTiming: 1–3 h\nPlace PreOmics CARTRIDGE into ADAPTER and WASTE tube, use multiple cartridges in parallel to purify the entire mixture.\nTransfer only the supernatant of the pooled TMT sample to a PreOmics cartridge, if there is a precipitate. The maximum peptide binding capacity per cartridge is 100 μg; adjust the loading volume per cartridge accordingly.\nSpin the cartridge in a centrifuge 2800 × g for 1–3 min.\nNote: adjust the centrifugation speed and time (maximum speed 6000 × g, 5 min) to ensure complete flow-through.\nAdd 200 μL of PreOmics WASH1 to cartridge and repeat step 46, discard flow-through.\nAdd 200 μL of PreOmics WASH2 to cartridge and repeat step 46, discard flow-through.",
    "Place the cartridge in a fresh collection tube using PreOmics ADAPTORs.\nAdd 100μL of PreOmics ELUTE to each cartridge and repeat step 46.\nRemove cartridge and place collection tube in a speed-vacuum concentrator (45°C, until completely dry, about 45 min).\nPause point: Store the dry peptides in −80°C for the next steps.\nHigh pH fractionation and mass spectrometry analysis\nTiming: 3–4 days\nFractionate aliquots of 50–100 μg TMT-labeled peptides dissolved in 40 μL of 10 mM ammonium formate (pH 10, Buffer A) by high-pH reversed phase chromatography using an Agilent 1100 HPLC system (Agilent Technologies) equipped with an auto sampler, a YMC Triart C18 0.5 × 250 mm column (YMC Europe GmbH) and a fraction collector. Separate the peptides using the following chromatography method: binary buffer system: high pH Buffer A: 20mM ammonium formate in water, pH10, high pH Buffer B: 20mM ammonium formate pH 10 in 90% acetonitrile, Flow rate: 12 μL/min, Gradient: 115 min in total (mobile phase compositions in %B): 0–5 min 2%–15%, 5–15 min 15%–25%, 15–80 min 25%–45%, 80–85 min 45%–65%, 85–95 min 65%–100%, 95–100 min 100%, 100–101 min 100-2%, 101–115 min 2%.\nCollect fractions from 3–112 min, then combine (concatenate) fractions (Yang et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]) to minimize the total number of samples for LC-MS analysis.",
    "Note: choose the kind of fractionation, concatenation and MS run time that achieves an acceptable ratio of instrument time vs. proteome coverage with your instrument configuration. We routinely collect 13.8 μL/fraction (96 fractions) into a microtiter plate and pairwise combine fractions from the earlier and the latter half of the gradient (i.e., fr1+fr49, fr2+fr50, etc.) to achieve a total of 48 fractions for each experiment, which we then analyzed with a 60 min MS method. If this concatenation seems excessive for an analysis in budding yeast, alternative schemes can be employed.\nFor each LC–MS run, approximately 1 μg of peptides were loaded onto a PepMap 100 C18 2 cm trap (Thermo Fisher) using an EASY nLC-1000 system (Thermo Fisher).\nOn-line peptide separation was performed on a 15 cm EASY-Spray C18 column (ES801, Thermo Fisher) by applying the following chromatography method: buffer A: 0.1% formic acid, buffer B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile, flow rate 250 nl/min, gradient 60 min in total, (mobile phase compositions in % B): 0-1:20 min 3%–6%, 1:20-49:30 min 6%–22%, 49:30–53 min 22%–40%, 53–54 min 40%–80%, 54–60 min 80–80% at a flow rate of 300 nL/min.",
    "An Orbitrap Fusion or Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer equipped with an EASY spray source (both Thermo Fisher Scientific) was operated in a data-dependent mode and TMT reporter ions were quantified from MS2 fragment ion spectra. Every 3 s, the most intense precursor ions from the Orbitrap survey scan (MS1) were selected for higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) fragmentation with 37% normalized collision energy. The Orbitrap analyzer was used to record MS2 spectra at either 15k (TMT6plex) or 50k (TMT9plex) resolution. To improve quantification accuracy and to avoid peptide fragment co-fragmentation, use of the instrument’s TMT Synchronous Precursor Selection (SPS) MS3 feature and real-time database search capabilities may be a good alternative.\nNote: We chose to use MS2 spectra detected in the Orbitrap analyzer for TMT peptide quantification and identification to achieve deep-proteome coverage and to allow potential localization of low abundant post-translational modifications where high mass accuracy and resolution can be beneficial."
