    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nInstall an implantable guide screw into the mouse skull\nTiming: 20 min/mouse\nThis step describes how to anesthetize mice and install an implantable guide screw into the mouse skull.\nNote: For more details about an implantable guide screw system, please refer to the reference by Lal et al.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nPrepare a heating pad to place mice after anesthesia.\nWeigh the mice and anesthetize them via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection with the dose of 100 μL/20 g bodyweight of anesthesia mix.\nNote: The dose applied would lead to anesthetizing mice for 40∼60 min. C57BL/6 mice of age 4∼6 weeks are usually around 20 g of body weight, and it is OK to apply 100 μL of anesthesia mix when the mouse body weight is 20 ± 1 g.\nPlace the anesthetized mice on the heating pad, and apply ophthalmic ointment to both eyes of the mice.\nNote: Ophthalmic ointment should be applied to mice for anesthesia longer than 5 min. Missing this step may result in mice being blind since the mouse's eyes remain open under anesthesia.\nLocate the point of the skull to install a guide screw.\nTake an anesthetized mouse to put on an operating table, and let the operational light focus on the mouse head.\nSterilize the mouse head with an alcohol swab and betadine.\nUse a Lance blade to make an incision in the center of the mouse skull vertically between the ears and reveal the midlines.\nFind the bregma of the skull (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2375-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. The position of the guide screw on the skull\nThe guide screw locates 2.5 mm on the right and 1.5 mm up from the bregma on the skull.",
    "Note: It may have blood when making the incision, making it hard to find the bregma. Use a cotton swab to remove the blood and let the skull dry for a while, making the bregma easier to find.\nUse a ruler to locate 2.5 mm to the right and 1.5 mm up, and make a point marker using a fine-tip Sharpie pen.\nInstall the guide screw into the skull.\nDrill a hole on the point marker with a small hand-controlled drill that is 1 mm in diameter.\nPlace a guide screw in the hole and rotate it until the guide screw is tight in the skull.\nCritical: It is crucial to make a proper size of the hole in the skull. A large hole leads to loosening an installed guide screw in the mouse skull. A 21-gauge needle or forceps with a similar diameter can be used to hold the guide screw and to gently squeeze into the hole (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nSeal the incision by using a surgical suture.\nAlternatives: A clip can seal the incision with an autoclip (stapler); however, the clip needs to be removed by a stapler remover one week later.\nConduct intraperitoneal injection (IP) injection of pain killer Meloxicam solution with 5 mg/kg dose (i.e., inject 200 μL of 0.5 mg/mL meloxicam solution into a mouse with a body weight of 20 g).\nPlace the mouse back on the heating pad until it wakes up.\nCheck the breathing of the mouse.\nReflex mouse routinely.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Demonstration of guide screw installation and intracranial implantation in mice, related to “Step-by-step method details” step 5 and step 11",
    "The movie illustrates the procedure of preparation and manipulation of how to install a guide screw into the mouse skull and conduct intracranial implantation of cells into the mouse cortex using the lab-customized stereotaxic frame with the syringe pump for 10 mice at one time.\nIntracranial implantation of QPP7 cells into mice\nTiming: ∼1–2 h/10 mice\nThis step describes how to perform intracranial implantation of tumor cell lines (e.g., QPP7 cells) into mice.\nAnesthetize the mice as described in steps #1-#3.\nDraw xenograft cells into Hamilton syringes.\nWash each syringe 10 times in each solution in the following order: 100% ethanol, 70% ethanol, and sterile DPBS.\nCritical: It is important not to introduce bubbles into the syringe when drawing the cells. Gently and slowly wash the syringe with 100% ethanol, which will eliminate bubbles in the syringe.\nTake the cells from the ice and gently flick the tube to mix the cells.\nPrepare 10 syringes by gently withdrawing about 7 μL of cells in solution into each one.\nPut the syringes on the injector frame and make the plunger underneath the driver of the infusion pump.\nControl the pump to push the driver, ensure each syringe has a little liquid coming out, and all the plungers touch the driver well.\nIntracranial implantation of tumor cells into 10 mice using the screw-guide stereotactic frame (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] and Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2375-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Intracranial implantation using the lab-customized screw-guide stereotaxic surgery platform\nSet-up of the intracranial implantation of 10 mice via the screw-guide stereotaxic frame with a syringe pump. The tumor cell line QPP7 of 1×105 cells in 5 μL DPBS were intracranially injected into each anesthetized C57BL/6 mouse.\nTake an anesthetized mouse to put on an operating table, and let the operating light focus on the mouse head.",
    "Sterilize the mouse head with an alcohol swab and betadine.\nUse a Lance blade to make a small incision to expose the guide screw.\nMove the mouse under the rack/clamp on the stereotactic frame.\nMake the needle of the Hamilton syringe into the guide screw hole.\nMake the plastic sleeve on the needle contact the skull tightly using forceps.\nAlternatives: Experienced researchers can avoid creating an additional incision by following the steps.\nUse a Hamilton syringe needle with a plastic sleeve (or cuff) to find the guide screw under the head skin and pierce it.\nPut the needle of a syringe with pre-loaded tumor cells into the guide screw.\nCarefully move the mouse together with the syringe and assembly into the stereotactic frame.\nPut a small piece of cotton under the mouse head to stabilize the mouse syringe set-up if needed.\nNote: Do not put too much cotton under the mouse's head since it may block the mouse's breathing. Ensure the syringe plunger touches the injector pump driver well.\nRepeat steps a-d until all the mice are set up in the stereotactic frame.\nNote: The number of mice for intracranial implantation depends upon the channel number of the injector. However, it is recommended not to perform more than 12 mice each time.\nIntracranial injection of 5 μL tumor cells by setting the pump with a speed of 0.5 μL/min.\nAfter the intracranial injection is finished, leave the needle in the guide screw for 10 min.\nCritical: It is important to leave the needle in the mouse brain for a while to let the cells stabilize in the brain and prevent them from coming out. Gently press the mouse head to make the needle move out a little every three min.",
    "Wash each syringe 10 times with sterile DPBS. If no additional intracranial injection is performed, wash 10 times in each solution in the following order: 70% ethanol and 100% ethanol.\nNote: Immediately wash the syringe after each intracranial injection to prevent blocking in the needle.\nApply pain killer (Meloxicam solution) to mice and wait for them to wake up, as described in steps #7 - #8.\nIntracranial delivery of the peptide for the treatment\nTiming: ∼1–2 h/10 mice\nThis step describes how to treat mouse glioblastoma by directly delivering the peptide to brain tumors using an implantable guide screw system.\nPrepare anesthetized mice and syringes with 20 μM peptides dissolved in sterilized DPBS as described in steps #9-#10.\nIntracranial injection of 5 μL peptides as described in step #11.\nApply pain killer (Meloxicam solution) to mice and wait for them to wake up, as described in steps #7 - #8.\nExamine tumor size with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nTiming: 20 min/mouse\nThis step describes how to examine tumor growth and the size of xenograft tumors by MRI.\nAnaesthetize mice by inhalation with isoflurane.\nPut a mouse in a clear plexiglass anesthesia induction box that allowed unimpeded visual monitoring of the animal.\nSet 3% isoflurane mixed with oxygen in the induction box for a few min until the mouse achieves the anesthesia plane.\nNote: The depth of anesthesia of the mouse can be checked by toe reflex and respiration rate.\nAcquire an MRI imaging of each mouse.\nTransfer the mouse to the animal bed for imaging. Monitor the mouse’s respiration by using a pneumatic sensor between the animal bed and the mouse’s abdomen, and maintain the animal’s temperature at 37°C.\nPut a nose cone with 1∼2% isoflurane in oxygen to maintain anesthesia.",
    "Scan the mouse with an MRI spectrometer with proper parameters.\nPlace the mouse back in the animal cage and monitor the mouse until it wakes up.\nNote: The time to check the tumor by MRI after intracranial implantation varies in different glioblastoma lines. For QPP7 cells, it usually takes about one month to form a tumor in the mouse brain; hence, it is recommended to start MRI in the third week after the intracranial implantation.\nDetermine the tumor size by MRI images.\nOpen the MRI image in ITK-SNAP (v.3.8.0).\nGo through each layer and find the largest tumor layer. In the software (e.g., Mac OS), go to Tools > Image Contrast > Contrast Adjustment. In the pop-up window, drag the circle in the “index into the color map” to make the tumor has good contrast with its around the tissue in the image.\nNote: We usually get 11∼13 scanning image layers, and 5∼8 layers often have the biggest tumor intersection.\nGo back to the main window of ITK-SNAP, choose the brush in the Main Toolbar on the left, and choose the proper size in the Brush Size drop-box.\nNote: Beginning with a bush size of 5 is a good start.\nUse the brush to paint and cover the tumor in each layer that has the tumor.\nNote: Try to cover the tumor part with brush painting accurately. Do not over-painting or leave some part of the tumor unpainted since the software will determine the tumor size based on the painting of each layer.\nOnce finishing painting the tumor in each layer, go to Segmentation > Volumes and Statistics. The software will calculate the tumor size.\nSample collection after peptide treatment\nTiming: ∼15–20 min/mouse\nThis step describes how to collect mouse serum, spleen, and brain.",
    "Note: When the mouse appears with phenomena of brain tumor (e.g., hunchback, irritability, trembling, and apastia), cease the animal for collecting samples.\nCease the mouse by CO2.\nPlace the mouse with the cage or directly into a clear plexiglass box that connects to a CO2 tank or pipeline.\nTurn on the valve of CO2 to cease the mouse.\nOnce the mouse stops breathing, remove it from the plexiglass box.\nStabilize the mouse as its abdomen upwards by pinning its four claws on a polyform.\nCollect blood from mouse heart (Cardiac blood collection) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2375-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Cardiac blood collection\nThe mouse was euthanized with CO2. The blood was collected immediately using a 1-mL syringe with a 26G ×1/2 inches needle.\nSpray the skin with 70% ethanol to disinfect, and use a scissor to dissect the skin along the ventral midline.\nExtend the dissection and gently open the skin without entering the peritoneal cavity.\nUse the needle with a 1 mL syringe to puncture the thoracic cavity a little right of the ventral midline.\nWithdraw the syringe plunger a little and slightly move the needle until the mouse blood enters the syringe.\nHold and stabilize the syringe, and withdraw the plunger until no more blood can be picked up.\nPush the plunger to let the blood into an EDTA-coated 1.5-mL centrifuge tube.\nNote: The mouse must be anesthetized or euthanized immediately prior to blood collection. The blood can be set in the 1.5-mL centrifuge tube at 25°C for about 30 min until all other samples are collected. Do not disturb the tube.\nCentrifuge the tube at 2000× g for 20 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the upper layer of the serum to a clean 1.5-mL centrifuge tube and store at −80°C.\nPerfuse the mouse (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2375-Fig5.jpg",
    "Figure 5. Perfusion of the mouse\n(A) Creation of a perfusion solution outlet by cutting the mouse liver.\n(B) Conduction of the perfusion by a hypodermic needle filled with DPBS.\nUse a scissor to open the peritoneal and thoracic cavities.\nFind the liver in the peritoneal cavity, and use a scissor to make a cut in the liver.\nFind the heart in the thoracic cavity and gently hold it in place with forceps.\nTake a DPBS-filled 30 mL syringe with an infusion needle attached.\nAlternatives: If the samples will be only used for immunohistochemistry, it is recommended to use 4% of PFA instead of DPBS to perform perfusion.\nInsert the needle into the left side of the heart.\nPush the syringe plunger to perfuse the heart with 20 mL of DPBS.\nNote: If perfusion is successful, the DPBS will come out from the incision in the liver, and it will gradually turn light brown. If the liver remains dark red, try perfusing again with additional DPBS.\nCollect spleen.\nReflect the liver craniodorsally and find the spleen on the right side of the abdomen, inferior to the stomach.\nRemove the spleen with forceps and scissors.\nPlace the spleen in DPBS in one well of a 6-well plate at 25°C.\nAlternatives: If the sample is perfused with 4% PFA, place the sample in a 15-mL conical tube with 4% PFA for about 12 h at 25°C, then switch to 20% sucrose for another day at 4°C before embedding into paraffin or OCT block.\nCollect brain.\nDecapitate the mouse using scissors.\nGently pull and remove the mouse head skin and fur with scissors.\nKeep the scissors toward the outside of the skull and carefully cut up the brainstem along the midline of the skull.",
    "Note: Try not to cut the brain when using scissors to cut the skull.\nBlunt dissection of the skull by using hemostatic forceps.\nGently insert the hemostatic forceps underneath the brain and remove the brain from the skull. Compared to the normal mouse brain, the brain with tumors shows hemorrhage on the cortical surface and swelling (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2375-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Comparison of normal mouse brain vs. brain with tumors\n(A) A normal mouse brain.\n(B) A mouse brain with tumors. The tumors grew in the cerebral cortex of the brain and emerged in the olfactory bulbs; the brain shows hemorrhage on the cortical surface and swelling.\nPlace the brain in DPBS in one well of a 6-well plate at 25°C.\nAlternatives: If the sample is perfused with 4% PFA, place the sample in a 15-mL conical tube with 4% PFA for about 12 h at 25°C, then switch to 20% sucrose for another day at 4°C before embedding into paraffin or OCT block.\nMouse brain and spleen processing and staining for flow cytometry analyses\nTiming: ∼8–10 h\nThis step describes how to isolate the mouse brain and spleen and then analyze the cell populations by flow cytometry.\nProcess brain.\nPlace the brain on the lid of the 6-well plate.\nUse a carbon blade and scissors to isolate the tumor region of the brain.\nTransfer the tumor back to the 6-well plate well containing DPBS, and use scissors to cut the tumor into 1 mm slices.\nNote: Do not mash up or mince the tumor since this will reduce cell viability.\nUse a P1000 pipettor with a slightly cut tip to transfer the tumor tissue into a 15-mL conical tube. Rinse the well with DPBS and transfer all residues of tumor tissue to the same 15-mL conical tube.",
    "Centrifuge the tube at 400 × g for 5 min at 25°C, and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 2 mL of Collagenase IV cocktail to the tumor tissue, and use a P1000 pipettor with a slightly cut tip to pipette the tumor tissue slurry up and down 15∼30 times.\nNote: Slowly pipette up and down the tumor slurry to ensure no tissue gets stuck in the pipette tip and then suck it up into the barrel.\nIncubate the tumor tissues in a Biometra OV5 Duo-Therm Hybridization Oven Incubator by rotating the conical tube bottom-to-top for 15 min at 37°C.\nNote: One can start to process the spleen by following step #24 while the brain tumor sample is incubating.\nCheck for tumor dissociation by gently pipetting up and down 30 times with a P1000 with a slightly cut tip and then 20∼30 times with a P1000 uncut tip.\nNote: Usually, 15 min of incubation with Collagenase IV cocktail followed by pipetting up and down is enough for the tumor tissues to be dissociated into single cells. If tissue dissociation remains incomplete, repeat step g one or two times with additional 15-min incubation until the tumor fragments can fit through an uncut P1000 tip.\nAdd 8 mL of ice-cold DPBS into the conical tube to make the total volume 10 mL, and gently flip the tube to mix the tumor cells.\nFilter the suspension through a 70-μm cell strainer into a new 15-mL conical tube, and rinse the strainer twice with 1 mL of ice-cold DPBS each time.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C, and discard the supernatant.\nLyse the red blood cells by resuspending the cell pellet with 2 mL of ACK Lysing Buffer.",
    "Note: Place the conical tube at 25°C for 1∼2 min, and swirl the tube several times every 30 s.\nAdd 8 mL of ice-cold DPBS into the conical tube and gently flip the tube to mix the tumor cells to quench the lysis.\nAliquot 10 μL of the suspension into a 1.5-mL centrifuge tube for cell counting.\nNote: It is recommended to use auto-counting equipment to count cells at this step if multiple samples are processed.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C, discard the supernatant and remove any liquid residue.\nPause point: The cells can be placed into Bambanker Cell Freezing Medium and stored in liquid nitrogen for up to 2 months before staining.\nResuspend tumor cells in the appropriate volume of ice-cold FACS Buffer and plate 2∼3 × 106 tumor cells in each well of a 96-well round bottom polypropylene plate on ice. Bring the final volume in each well to 100 μL with ice-cold FACS buffer.\nProcess spleen.\nPlace a 40-μm cell strainer in the 6-well plate well containing DPBS at 25°C, and transfer the spleen to the strainer.\nUse the end of a 1-mL syringe plunger to macerate the spleen. Once the majority of the spleen tissue has filtered through the cell strainer, rinse the end of the syringe plunger and strainer with DPBS. Discard the strainer.\nTransfer the dissociated spleen cells to a 15-mL conical tube. Rinse the 6-well plate well with DPBS and transfer it to the same conical tube. Add additional DPBS to make the volume up to 10 mL in total.\nCentrifuge the spleen cells at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C.
