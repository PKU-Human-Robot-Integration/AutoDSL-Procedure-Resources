    "Animal procedures were conducted according to European Community Council Directives 86/609/EEC guidelines and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.\n1. Animal Model\nAnesthetize male Wistar rats weighing 300 - 400 g with isoflurane in N2/O2 flow (70%/30%) through a facemask for the duration of the operation and MRI experiments. Induce anesthesia in ventilated hood. Maintain isoflurane levels between 1.5 and 2.4%.\nMonitor depth of anesthesia during MRI from breathing frequency via a pneumatic pillow under the torso. Lack of response to pinch reflex is taken as a sign of sufficient depth for surgical anesthesia. Use isoflurane scavenger attached to a magnet bore.\nPerform permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) to induce focal ischemic stroke. Use the intraluminal thread model for MCAO and carry out the operation according to methods given by Longa et al.22.\nLeave the occluding thread (silicon-PTFE tempered monofil filament, diameter 0.22 mm) in place for the duration of the MRI experiment.\nAnalyze arterial blood gases and pH using a blood analyzer.\nDuring the MRI, monitor the breathing rate with a pneumatic pillow placed under the torso and the rectal temperature using a rectal temperature monitoring system. Maintain a core temperature close to 37 °C using a water heating pad under the torso.\nImmediately after MCAO, secure the rat in a cradle at the center of the magnet bore using a rat head holder. Inject 2 mL of saline intraperitoneally before transferring the rats into the magnet bore.\n2. MRI\nAcquire MRI data using a 9.4T/31 cm (with the 12-cm gradient insert) horizontal magnet interfaced to a console equipped with an actively decoupled linear volume transmitter and quadrature receiver coil pair.",
    "Scan each rat for up to 5 h post MCAO. At hourly intervals (60, 120, 180, 240 min post MCAO), acquire 12 congruently sampled (0.5 mm slice-gap, slice thickness = 1 mm, field of view = 2.56 cm x 2.56 cm) coronal slices of the trace of diffusion tensor (2.2.1.), Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill T2 (2.2.2.) and Fast Low Angle Shot T1 (2.2.3.).\nObtain the trace of the diffusion tensor images (Dav= 1/3 trace [D]) with three bipolar gradients along each axis (the duration of the diffusion gradient = 5 ms, the diffusion time = 15 ms) and three b-values (0, 400 and 1400 s/mm-2s), where, Δ = 15 ms, ∂ = 5 ms, echo time (TE) = 36 ms, repetition time (TR) = 4000 ms and acquisition time = 7.36 min.\nObtain the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill T2 sequence with 12 echoes for T2 quantification, where echo-spacing = 10 ms, TR = 2000 ms and acquisition time = 4.20 min.\nObtain the Fast Low Angle Shot (FLASH) for T1, where the time from inversion to the first FLASH sequence (T10) is 7.58 ms, with 600 ms increments of 10 inversions up to 5407.58 ms, TR = 5.5 ms, time between inversion pulses (Trelax) = 10 s and acquisition time = 8.20 min.\n3. Image Processing\nComputation of relaxometry and ADC maps: Compute qT2, qT1 and ADC maps using Matlab functions provided on University of Bristol website [DOI:10.5523/bris.1bjytiabmtwqx2kodgbzkwso0k], for which the input is a file path to the location of the MRI data.",
    "For T2 data, apply Hamming filtering in k-space prior to reconstruction of images (or in image domain by convolution, with equivalent results but computationally less efficient). Compute qT2 maps by taking the logarithm of each time series and solving on a voxel-wise basis by linear least-squares (a bi-exponential fit can also be performed to the T2 decays, but the voxel-wise F-tests tests revealed that voxels within the image for which additional parameters could not be justified).\nFor T1 data, apply Hamming filtering in k-space prior to reconstruction of images. Perform T1 fitting according to methods given in reference 23. To deal with the problem of unknown sign (due to the use of magnitude images), the lowest-intensity point may be either excluded, or estimated in the course of fitting with similar results.\nFor diffusion-weighted data, apply Hamming filtering by convolution in image domain (this is more straightforward due to the segmented k-space trajectory). Fit ADC maps by the method in13.\nIdentification of ischemic tissue\nIdentify ischemic tissue on reciprocal Dav images (1/Dav) as this provides clear contrast for lesion identification. To generate ischemic volumes of interest (VOI), define ischemic tissue as voxels with values one median absolute deviation above the median value of the whole-brain 1/Dav distribution. To identify homologous regions in the non-ischemic hemisphere, reflect the ischemic VOI about the vertical axis. Manually adjust non-ischemic VOIs to avoid including voxels containing cerebrospinal fluid.\nIn order to determine the relationship of qT1 and qT2 with time post MCAO, for each rat and time-point, load the ischemic and non-ischemic VOIs onto qT1 and qT2 maps. Extract mean relaxation times and calculate the percentage difference in qT1 and qT2 between hemispheres (ΔT1 and ΔT2) using the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55277/55277eq1.jpg",
    "Where Tx is the chosen parameter, qT1 or qT2. imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55277/55277eq2.jpgrefers to the mean relaxation time of the ischemic VOI and imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55277/55277eq3.jpg the mean relaxation time in the non-ischemic VOI. The non-ischemic VOI should be used so that each rat serves as its own control.\nUse the following criteria to identify voxels with elevated qT1 and qT2: any voxels within the ischemic VOI with relaxation times exceeding the median relaxation time of the qT1 or qT2 distribution in the non-ischemic VOI by more than one half-width at half-maximum (HWMH). These criteria mean relaxation times must be in the 95th percentile or higher to be classified as 'high'. Use of the median relaxation time of the non-ischemic VOI allows each rat to serve as its own control.\nTo picture the spatial distribution of relaxation time changes within regions of decreased diffusion, identify and color code voxels with elevated qT1 or qT2 as well as voxels with both elevated qT1 and qT2 termed 'qT1 and qT2 overlap'.\nTo determine the size of the lesion according to qT1 and qT2, compute the parameter f (as introduced by Knight et al. 18) from MRI data acquired for each rat and time-point. f1 and f2 represent the number of voxels with high qT1 or qT2 (respectively) as a percentage of the size of the ischemic VOI.\n\t\t\nUse the following equation to calculate f1 and f2:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55277/55277eq4.jpg",
    "Where imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55277/55277eq5.jpg refers to the relaxation time (qT1 or qT2), imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55277/55277eq6.jpgrefers to the number of 'high' relaxation time voxels in the ischemic VOI, imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55277/55277eq7.jpg is the number of 'low' relaxation time voxels in the ischemic VOI and imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55277/55277eq8.jpg, the total number of voxels within the ischemic VOI. Criteria for identifying voxels with elevated qT1 and qT2 are outlined in section 3.2.3. 'Low' voxels are voxels with relaxation times less than the median qT1 or qT2 of the non-ischemic VOI by one HWHM. The subtraction of imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55277/55277eq7.jpg allows for decreases in relaxation times due to ischemia or other pathologies 17. \nDetermine the extent of 'qT1 and qT2 overlap' by calculating the volume of overlapping elevated qT1 and qT2 as a percentage of whole brain volumes, hereby referred to as 'VOverlap'. Use the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55277/55277eq9.jpg\n\t\t\tWhere, imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55277/55277eq10.jpg refers to the number of voxels within the ischemic VOI with both 'high' qT1 and 'high' qT2 and imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55277/55277eq11.jpg represents the total number of voxels in the whole rat brain. Determine the number of voxels in the rat brain by manually creating a VOI around the whole brain on qT2 relaxometry maps.\n4. Verification of Ischemic Lesion with Triphenyletrazolium Chloride (TTC)\nImmediately after decapitation, carefully extract the rat brain from the skull. Complete this procedure within 10 min from the time the rat was decapitated.\nStore brains in refrigerated 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) before using a rat brain slicer matrix to section the brain into serial 1 mm-thick coronal slices.\nAfter sectioning, incubate each brain slice in 20 mL PBS containing TTC at 37 °C for 30 min in the dark, as recommended in 24. Although 1% TTC concentration is acceptable, use 0.5% for improved contrast.\nCover the containers of the sections in foil to keep it dark.",
    "After incubation, remove the TTC solution using a pipette and wash slices in three changes of PBS.\nImmediately photograph slices using a standard light microscope and a digital camera.\n5. Statistical Analysis\nCarry out statistical analysis using Matlab and statistical software.\nDetermining the relationship of MR parameters with time\nPerform Pearson's correlations on pooled rat data to determine the relationship of ΔT1, ΔT2, f1 and f2 andVOverlap with time post MCAO.\nFor parameters that show a significant linear relationship (p <0.05), perform linear least square regression to determine whether stroke onset time can be predicted by quantifying the parameter of interest. Use the root mean square error (RMSE) to assess the accuracy of onset time estimates.\nQuantification of lesion size\nTo compare lesion sizes according to different qMRI parameters, conduct one-way related ANOVAs and Fisher's least significant difference post-hoc on the average number of voxels in the ischemic VOI and the average number of voxels with high qT1 and qT2. Differences are considered significant at p <0.05. If sphericity assumptions are not met per Mauchly's sphericity test, correct degrees of freedom and significance values according to Greenhouse Geisser estimates."
