    "Eyes were obtained according to the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki for research involving human tissue.\nNOTE: Eyes from reputable eye banks (e.g., Lions Eye Institute for Transplant, Research, Tampa FL) were harvested within 6–12 h of death and donor serum was tested for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus 1 and 2. Once they were received, the eyes were dissected and set up in the TAS model within 24 h. Exclusion criteria included any ocular pathology. Eyes were not excluded based on age, race, or gender. To ensure the viability of the retina upon receipt, retinal explants were harvested from the tissue donors and cultured for 7 and 14 days (Supplemental Figure 1). These retinas were also dissociated and grew healthy RGCs in culture for 7 days with positive staining for RGC marker, RNA-binding protein with multiple splicing (RBPMS), as well as positive neurofilament light chain (NEFL) staining in their neurofilaments (Supplemental Figure 2). .\n1. Preparation and sterilization of equipment and supplies\nRefer to the Table of Materials for a complete list of supplies required as well as supplier and catalogue numbers.\nPrior to use, sterilize all equipment and instruments by autoclaving or using ethylene oxide ampules.\n2. Preparation of perfusion medium\nAdd 1% penicillin streptomycin (10,000 U/mL penicillin, 10,000 μg/mL streptomycin in 0.85% NaCl) and 1% L-glutamine (200 mM) to 1,000 mL high glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM).\nSterilize the perfusion medium by passing through a 0.22 μm filter.\n3. Translaminar autonomous system (TAS) setup\nSet up inflow syringes (IOP and ICP reservoirs).",
    "Add 30 mL of the perfusion medium (section 2) to a 30 mL syringe. Attach a 3-way stopcock to the 30 mL syringe. Attach a 0.22 μm hydrophilic filter to the 3-way stopcock. Attach a 15 G Luer stub adapter to the 0.22 μm hydrophilic filter.\nRemove air bubbles from the syringe setup. Attach tubing to the 15 G Luer stub adapter. Close the side port of the stopcock with an unvented universal lock cap. Repeat for a total of two setups.\nLabel one syringe as channel 1 intracranial pressure (CH1 ICP) and the other syringe as channel 2 intraocular pressure (CH2 IOP).\nSet up outflow syringes (IOP and ICP reservoirs).\n\t\nAttach a 3-way stopcock to a 30 mL syringe. Attach a 15 G Luer stub adapter to the 3-way stopcock. Attach tubing to the 15 G Luer stub adapter.\nClose the side port of the stopcock with an unvented universal lock cap. Repeat for a total of two setups. Label one syringe as CH1 ICP and the other syringe as CH2 IOP.\n4. Preparation of human whole eye globe\nNOTE: If whole eyes are received, follow the procedure below to separate the anterior segment from the posterior segment of the eye. If the eyes are received bisected, start at step 4.4.\nPlace a whole eye into povidone-iodine solution for 2 min.\nRinse the eye in sterile phosphate buffered solution (PBS) to rinse off the povidone-iodine. Repeat 2 times.\nRemove the adnexa from the whole eye globe using forceps and scissors. Bisect the eye at the equator to separate the anterior and posterior segments of the eye.\nRemove the optic nerve sheath. Remove the vitreous humor from the posterior segment.",
    "Trim additional sclera from posterior segment, if needed, to ensure a good fit on the round dome of the IOP (bottom) chamber. Using forceps, ensure that the retina is spread evenly over the posterior of the segment.\nIOP (bottom) chamber setup\n\t\nPlace the human posterior segment into the IOP (bottom) chamber of the TAS over the round dome with the optic nerve facing the top.\nSeal the posterior segment using the epoxy resin O-ring with four screws, ensuring a tight seal.\nInsert the tubing into the IN and OUT ports of the IOP (bottom) chamber. The IOP inflow syringe with tubing containing medium is inserted into the IN port and the empty IOP outflow syringe with tubing is inserted into the OUT port.\nUse the push/pull method to slowly infuse the perfusion medium into the inflow port to fill the posterior eye cup while simultaneously slowly pulling the perfusion medium out through the outflow syringe to remove any air bubbles from the lines. Stop infusing medium once both the IN and OUT tubes are void of air bubbles.\nLock the stopcocks in the off position. Remove the 30 mL syringe from the IOP IN port filter assembly and refill with a total of 30 mL of medium. Replace the 30 mL syringe onto the filter assembly.\nICP (top) chamber setup\nPlace the ICP (top) chamber/lid over the back of the posterior segment. Make certain that the optic nerve is within the top chamber. Seal the top chamber with four screws.\nInsert the tubing into the IN and OUT ports of the ICP (top) chamber. The ICP inflow syringe with tubing containing medium is inserted into the IN port and the empty ICP outflow syringe with tubing is inserted into the OUT port.",
    "Gently and slowly infuse the medium into the IN port to fill the ICP chamber and remove air bubbles from the lines using the push/pull method. Stop infusing medium once the ICP chamber as well as both the IN and OUT tubing are void of air bubbles.\nLock the stopcocks in the off position. Remove the 30 mL syringe from the ICP in port filter assembly and refill with a total of 30 mL of medium. Replace the 30 mL syringe onto the filter assembly.\n5.
