    "This protocol was approved by the Emory Institutional Review Board and the Atlanta Veterans Administration Research & Development Committee. All participants signed an informed consent document prior to participation.\n1. Participant recruitment\nRecruit older adults and individuals with PD and prodromal Alzheimer's disease (pAD) through flyers, registries, referrals, PD newsletters, educational meetings, webinars, support groups, older adult living communities, and websites (see Table 1 for participant information).\nEnsure the participants with PD have been diagnosed with \"idiopathic\" Parkinson's and positively respond to dopaminergic therapy7. Ensure that those with pAD have mild cognitive impairment with subjective memory loss.\nConfirm that participants with either PD or pAD have no other neurological insult and can ambulate 3 meters or more with and without assistance.\n2. Safety training\nTrain staff, instructors, care partners, and volunteers through an in-person experiential balance management class, a systematic approach to understanding balance, by presenting information about the three systems underlying balance: vestibular, visual, and somatosensory.\n\t\nIntroduce principles such as the base of support, the center of gravity, and limits of stability. Perform exercises such as (1) standing while shifting to the edges of one's feet and maintaining balance, (2) closing the eyes while standing and shifting weight from foot to foot, (3) observing a partner shift their weight until the partner has to take a step and learning to use body weight to support the weight of a partner.\nUse the balance management exercises from the previously mentioned balance management class (step 2.1.1) to increase the team's ability to detect and prevent potential falls in a rehabilitative movement class.\nProvide ongoing education to staff given by the principal investigator (PI) and staff physical therapists regarding protecting participants with specific gait and balance impairments.\n3. Technological considerations",
    "Identify and use any commercially available fitness app (see the Table of Materials) that can track time, distance, steps, pace, elevation, and other parameters needed for goal setting and to show progress.\nIdentify a team meeting platform with video and sound capabilities (see the Table of Materials) for the virtual warm up.\nUse a one-tap mobile or conference call line for the virtual walk and cool down.\nUtilize heart rate monitors (see the Table of Materials) to track the heart rate throughout the walk.\nCreate detailed written and picture instructions for using the fitness app, video team meeting platform, and conference call line. Email the instructions to all new participants 2 days prior to the walk day. Give technical support to all participants prior to and throughout the walks.\n4. Overground walk environment\nPlan and inspect a safe outdoor walking route in terms of the convenience, safety, and appropriateness for older adults with sensory and motor impairments prior to the in-person walk in the local neighborhood, town, or near the older adult center.\n\t\nMake a note of rest spots, benches, and shade, which can be useful during the walk, any uneven surfaces and curbs, which may present safety issues, and other important environmental assets or hazards. Consider the amount of traffic in the area and the overall quality of the sidewalks and/or walking paths.\nEnsure that there is an appropriate, older adult-safe walking environment, including limited traffic, clear and even sidewalks, benches or other rest spots, shade, and mostly level ground. Some small inclines and declines may be tolerable, but check for ramps for those participants using rolling walkers.\n5. Participant screening for virtual versus in-person walking groups",
    "Request that the participants complete a questionnaire regarding their age, education, medical history, fall history, use of assistive devices such as canes/walkers, and current medications during their initial testing session or prior to the first walk. Review the form with all the participants to ensure completeness/accuracy.\n\tNOTE: Participants are not deemed appropriate for virtual walking classes due to safety considerations if they have a score of 4 or higher or if they answer \"yes\" to any of the first three key questions on the Stay Independent Screener8, if the participant scores a 2 or higher on item 3 of the New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire9, if an assistive device is used regularly, or if the participant reports falling more than once per month.\nUse other fitness metrics to assess the fitness to maintain safety and to evaluate progress (e.g., heart rate monitoring, VO2 submaximal assessment, 6 min walk test, Mini Best test, and vascular function measurement using a commercially available device)10,11,12 (see the Table of Materials).\n6. Schedule the participants for a walk\nHost virtual and in-person walks simultaneously with the number of staff necessary to fill the lead, co-lead, and back-marker positions, as well as any other staff needed for safety/assistance.\nSchedule the walks at a time of day that is appropriate for the group.\nSchedule the walks twice per week for 12 weeks, ensuring a minimum of 20 walks in total. After 12 weeks, invite the participants to walk once per week. The walk presented in this study was 90 min, including the warm up, walk, and cool down.\nEmail the virtual walk group instructions to participants 2 days prior to the day of the walk. The instructions are below:\n\t\nUse an invitation with a link to a one-tap mobile or other video or conference call line.",
    "Provide new participants with instructions on how to use the technology and fitness tracking app, as well as regarding safety and appropriate attire.\n7. Staff roles and responsibilities\nGroup lead responsibilities\n\t\nIdentify participants who have similar walking abilities before the walk. Assign back-markers/staff to participants who are deemed a high fall risk to protect them during the warm up, walk, and cool down.\nIntroduce the self and the co-leader at the beginning of the session, along with other staff members. Educate the participants on the Borg Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) 10-point scale13, which is used to determine the participant's perceptions of their physical effort. Briefly discuss the session's agenda.\nLead a total body warm up using cues for safety, effort, and time/repetitions.\nMonitor the remote participants during the warm up to ensure proper form, alignment, and safety.\nMotivate the participants. Tell them they are doing well if they participate. Congratulate all the participants on their efforts.\nPay attention to the time for the warm ups, breaks, walks, and cool downs.\nAssess the participants continuously during one-tap mobile/conference call during the walk for safety, intensity, and form.\nProvide verbal cues for posture and gait mechanics (Table 2) after each RPE update and if a participant has not been heard speaking for a long period of time (to ensure we do not lose contact with a participant).\nEncourage rest and hydration breaks.\nAsk the participants about their walking environment (e.g., sidewalks, hills, etc.) and their walking form (posture). Check in with the participants frequently about safety concerns and how they can monitor and maintain good biomechanics of gait.\nLead the cool-down after the walk on the one-tap mobile or conference call line.\nAnswer any questions regarding the technology, walking form, intensity, goals, etc.",
    "Take over responsibilities if the co-leader becomes disconnected for any reason.\nCo-lead responsibilities\n\t\nEmail the participant information and instructions for the fitness tracking app and team meeting links to all the participants 2 days prior to the walk.\nTake attendance at the start of the meeting. If a participant is not in attendance, call the participant to check on them.\nAssist the participants with the use of technology during the practice team meeting video calls.\nAssist the participants during the transition between the video call and the one-tap mobile call during the 5 min break.\nAssist the participants with the setting up, usage, and starting/stopping of the fitness tracking app.\nAsk and record the participants' RPE and heart rates pre-warm up, post-warm up, and at the 15 min, 30 min, and 45 min time points of the walk.\nManually record the RPE, heart rates, steps, distance walked, elevation, and average pace for the participants at the 45 min time point of the walk.\nEnter the data into any commercially available database survey software immediately or as soon as possible after collecting the data.\nTake over group leader responsibilities should the group leader become disconnected from the call for any reason.\nBack-marker/other staff responsibilities\n\t\nEnsure all the participants' safety, particularly for the participants who have slower walking speeds, use an assistive device, or have a heightened fall risk, postural instability, or freezing of gait. Staff may be paired one-on-one or even two-on-one with participants who have been deemed a high fall risk.\nEnsure participants are walking along the same route and no participants become lost on the route. Watch for traffic carefully, and alert the group to oncoming traffic.\nAssist with any additional responsibilities as requested by the group leader or co-leader.\nSocialize with the participants during the walk.",
    "8. Virtual and in-person walk: Preparation steps\nVirtual walk procedure\n\t\nAt 15-20 min prior to the class time, log into the video team meeting. Educate new participants on the RPE scale. Lead a warm up for 25 min. Take the RPE pre- and post-warm up (co-leader).\nThe warm up is performed by the group leader with whole-body large-amplitude movements incorporating posture, weight shifting, rotation, and stepping. Lead the warm up in both seated and standing positions with cues for safety, effort, amplitude, and form. Verbally ensure the safety of the participants.\nImplement a break for 5 min to prepare the participants for the walk. Assist the participants in logging on to the approved fitness tracking app and one-tap mobile or other conference call line.\nInstruct the participants in proper posture and gait mechanics after every RPE check-in and through the walk. See Table 2 for a complete list of cues. Ask the participants to be mindful of their environments and to describe their surroundings.\nLimit the walking group to four to six participants. Strongly encourage the participants to bring a caregiver or a walking buddy to their walks. Discuss with the participants the location and terrain of the walks prior to the first walk to ensure safety and familiarity with the chosen area.\nTake and record the participant's RPE at 15 min, 30 min, and 45 min.\nAsk the participants to stop their fitness tracking app after 45 min and participate in a 5-10 min guided cool down from the instructor delivered through the audio function.\nIn-person walk procedure\n\t\nArrive at an established walking location wearing a mask. Screen the participants for COVID-19, and assist with wearable HR and fitness tracking technology. Educate new participants on the RPE scale and agenda.",
    "Lead a warm up with whole-body large-amplitude movements incorporating posture, weight shifting, rotation, and stepping. Lead both seated and standing exercises with cues for safety, effort, amplitude, and form. Have an assigned staff member protect the participants with balance impairments to ensure their safety.\nRecord the RPE and HR pre- and post-warm up.\nImplement a break for 5 min to prepare the participants for the walk. Assist the participants in starting the walking app technology.\nDivide the walking group into smaller groups based on speed, ability, and fall risk. Assign each walking group a leader, a back-marker, and/or other study staff, with one person in each group remaining on the audio call. The leader of the group with the greatest walking mobility leads the virtual walking group.\nRecord the RPE and HR at the 15 min, 30 min, and 45 min time points.\nGive posture and gait cues at the beginning of the walk at 15 min, 30 min, and 45 min. Safety is of the utmost importance. Participants who are considered a high fall risk will have at least one person walking with them for safety and guarding. These individuals should be closely monitored for fatigue. Give cues for environmental hazards and encourage rest breaks and the use of assistive devices.\nAsk the participants to stop their walking app at the 45 min time point and participate in a 5-10 min guided cool down.\nAdminister a satisfaction questionnaire intermittently (approximately every 10 classes) to determine the level of enjoyment the participants are experiencing.\n9. Participant post-evaluation\nMeasure the chosen fitness metrics, as noted in step 5.2, to determine the change in the participants' fitness over the course of the walking program.\nAdminister a participant satisfaction survey.\nSubscription Required.
