    "1. Requirements for In ovo Electroporation\nPreparing the vector construct: \n  miR sense and antisense primers were designed after the instructions of Ambion, annealed and ligated into ApaI/EcoRI digested pSilencer U6.1 vector. After successful transformation one of the resulting clones was grown and pSilencer plasmid was isolated by alkaline lysis method using a Quiagen midi preparation kit.  \nElectrodes: \n  Electrodes can be purchased or easily be built13. We use self-made electrodes of platinum wire (Φ = 0.2, 0.25, or 0.5 mm in diameter) or in some cases an even smaller tungsten wire electrode (Φ = 0.1 mm)8 depending on which area we want to electroporate. To avoid scorching of tissue, we use as a rule the nearer to the tissue the thinner the electrodes. For broad electroporation of midbrain, we use 0.5 mm platinum wires soldered to a brass/stainless steel tubular shaft and fixed to an electrode holder with a distance of 3-5 mm (Figure 1). To electroporate specific areas, we use 0.25 mm platinum wire anodes and 0.2 mm platinum wire or 0.1 mm tungsten for the cathode with an approximate distance of 1 mm or less.   \nSolutions: Have the following solutions ready:  \n    \nAutoclaved chicken Ringer, pH 7.5 (9.0 g NaCl, 0.42 g KCl, 0.24 g CaCl2, dissolve in 1 L distilled water).\nPBS (8 g NaCl, 0.2 g KCl, 0.24 g KH2PO4, 1.44 g Na2HPO4, dissolve in 1l distilled H2O).        \nFast Green: stock solution 10 mg/ml distilled H2O\n Slow drying ink (less shellac and thus less poisoning for the embryo). Note: A blue dichroic filter attached to a fiber optic lamp as described in Canto-Soler and Adler14 enhances the contrast and can eliminate the need to inject ink.  \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50024/50024fig1.jpg",
    "Figure 1. Schematic diagram of electrodes and electrode holder.  (A, B, C) Platinum wire was soldered to one side of a stainless steel tubular shaft. A hole was drilled into the other side of the tubular shaft thus that pin plugs can fit in. (A) Red and blue colored wires were connected to the pin plugs. At the opposite end the wire was fitted to banana connectors that work with the electrical sockets of the electroporator. (A, C) The platinum wire was bent in an angel of 90°.  A layer of nail varnish isolated the shaft above the bend.\n2. Preparations Directly Before  In ovo Electroporation\nPrepare the following material:\n    \nDilute Ink with chicken Ringer 1:6, add Antibiotic-Antimycotic solution (100x from Gibco) 1:100.\nPrepare vector solution: 1-2 μg/μl per specific DNA in H2O supplemented with Fast Green (1:20).\nSterilize forceps, scissors, tungsten needle and electrodes with 70% ethanol.\nPull micropipettes for nucleic acid injection from borosilicate glass capillaries (length to outer diameter: 100 mm x 0.9 mm). We use a simple puller PUL-1 (WPI, Berlin) with the settings shown in Table 1. \nSet the parameters of the electroporator as shown in Table 2.\ntable:\n﻿0,1\nParameters,Values\nHeat,350\nPull,100\nVelocity,50\nDelay,200\nTable 1.

    "Incubate fertilized chicken eggs on their longer side at 37 °C with 65% humidity for 39 hr to acquire embryos between Hamburger & Hamilton (HH) stages15 9-11. The embryo settles at the topmost part of the egg, so you should mark it with a pencil line.\nDisinfect the eggs with 70% ethanol. \nPierce the egg at its broader side, where the air cavity should be. \nRemove 1-2 ml of egg white. This will detach the embryo from the eggshell. \nCello-tape the eggshell to avoid shell splinters falling onto the embryo. Use a pair of scissors to cut a small window into the eggshell around the pencil line. \nInject a bit of ink underneath the area opaca to visualize the embryo.\nMake a cut into the vitelline membrane with a sharpened tungsten needle to achieve a better accessibility of the embryo for nucleic acid injection and electroporation. \n3. Electroporation and Incubation\nAdd a few drops of warm Ringer's solution onto the embryos. This will lower the embryos, prevent overheating, sticking of the electrodes to the tissue and provide a medium for the current between the two electrodes.    \nInject the vector solution into the lumen of the neural tube at midbrain level. If your DNA expression vector contains no reporter gene (e.g. EGFP), add a slightly lower concentrated reporter gene vector (1 μg/μl miR expressing vector to 0.9 μg/μl reporter gene vector) to the DNA solution. This will ensure that you recognize transfected cells later8. We use the so-called pCAX vector, a kind gift from C. Krull 13.",
    "For a broad transfection of the midbrain, place the electrodes left and right of the embryo at the height of the midbrain. The distance between the electrodes should be around 3-5 mm. The other settings are 15V, 20 msec pulses and 50 msec delay for HH 10. Changing the position of the two electrodes slightly along the dorso-ventral (DV) axis of the midbrain assures a more a broad transfection of cells  the DV axis transfection. \nFor ventral transfection, add some Ringer to raise the head from the yolk membrane and place the anode beneath ventral midbrain. If the head does not rise push the electrode under the membrane that separates yolk and embryo to avoid scorching of the neural tube. The cathode should be placed above the midbrain dorso-laterally opposite to the anode. Do not touch the neural tube. We transfect the left ventral half of the midbrain to avoid any difficulties with heart development. The distance between the electrodes is around 1-0.5 mm, the rest of the settings are 10V, 20 msec width and 50 msec delay.\nApply another drop of Saline on top of the embryos to cool it down and remove air bubbles. \nSeal the eggs with the tape and incubate for at least 4 hr; the minimum time required for vector expression. \n 4. Fixation of Chicken Embryos\nRemove the embryos from their eggs. \nClean embryos under a stereomicroscope and assess the  extent of transfection with a fluorescent stereo microscope. \nFix the embryos over night in 4% PFA at 4°C. Proceed with sectioning and/or staining (in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry) to analyse changes in the transfected area. \nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
