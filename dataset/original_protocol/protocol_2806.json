    "This section describes how to measure the fasting blood insulin level from tail veins at different time point after D-glucose injection. Refer to troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\nFast mice for 6 h with free to access autoclaved water.\nPrepare 0.15 g/mL glucose solution in saline to increase plasma insulin level rapidly.\nLabel the mice with ear tag or marker pen.\nScale mice body weight and calculate the D-glucose volume (3 g/kg bodyweight) for each mouse according to the body weight.\nI.p. inject D-glucose to mice in sequence and start timing.\nMeasure blood glucose level and collect blood samples from tail-tip bleeding at 0, 2, 5, and 15 min (first phase insulin secretion) after glucose injection.\nCentrifuge the blood by 5,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C, collect the plasma, and store at −80°C for later use.\nDetermine plasma insulin levels by insulin ultra-sensitive kit according to the manufacturer’s instruction (https://www.crystalchem.com/media/catalog/product/9/0/90080c.pdf[href=https://www.crystalchem.com/media/catalog/product/9/0/90080c.pdf]).\nPause point: If measurements of insulin level will be done on another day, store plasma at −80°C.\nCritical: Pancreatic β-cells secrete insulin in a biphasic manner at first and second phase. First phase insulin secretion occurs within 10 min of glucose stimulation, while second phase insulin secretion is occurring 25–30 min after glucose stimulation. Loss of first phase insulin secretion is an independent predictor of T2D onset. Don't collect blood samples from tail-tip bleeding more than 15 min after glucose injection.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]\nPancreas histologic analysis for islet number and insulin expression\nTiming: 5 days\nThis section describes how to perform histologic analysis for islet function by measuring insulin expression, total islet number, and islet size distribution in pancreas.
