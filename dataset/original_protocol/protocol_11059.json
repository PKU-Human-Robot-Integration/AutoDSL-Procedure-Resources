    "Ethical animal use was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), which acts in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act. Animals were housed in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC) approved facility and treated according to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n1. Anesthesia\nPlace mice in the box of a small animal anesthesia system (Figure 1). Deliver 4% isoflurane to the box and wait for 5-10 min at which time lower the isoflurane to 2-3%.\nConfirm the anesthesia depth via toe pinch. Apply eye lubricant to prevent drying. Move the subject to the nose cone with 2% isoflurane flow.\nUse the above technique to anesthetize each mouse for shaving and limb measurement assay. Use an intraperitoneal pentobarbital injection dose of 1.25 mg/kg to anesthetize mice for irradiation.\n2. Skin area preparation\nPlan to shave the mice 2-3 days before irradiating. Trim the hair using a clipper (Figure 2A).\nApply depilatory cream and wait for 1-2 min (Figure 2B). Wipe the cream with dry gauze and rinse the skin with a phosphate buffer saline (PBS)-soaked gauze (Figure 2C).\n3. Irradiation procedure\nAnesthetize each mouse with an intraperitoneal injection administered 5 min before irradiation. Position the limb in the radiation field (25 cm x 25 cm) and secure it with surgical tape (Figure 3A-C).\nRestrict the body using surgical tape (Figure 3D). Place a 1 cm thick bolus to prevent/minimize deep penetration of radiations (Figure 3E).",
    "Calculate the applicator and cutout factors to deliver 40 Gy to the mouse skin. For the experiment here, use a linear accelerator to generate a 6 MeV electron beam for 3740 monitor units to induce irradiation burns. In this setting, a 25 cm x 25 cm radiation field at 1,000 MU/min dose with 100 cm source to surface distance (SSD), which is the distance from the irradiation source to the top of the bolus to deliver the 40 Gy. Irradiation time will vary according to linear accelerator used, beam energy and field size. A radiation or medical physicist should be consulted to calculate the monitor units necessary to deliver 40Gy on the linear accelerator.\n4. Visual monitoring of fibrosis development\nUse a handheld digital camera to document the progression of fibrosis. Use the macro setting to capture detailed photos.\nAnesethetize mice by inhalation of isoflurane.\nTake pictures by positioning the lens closer to the skin and press capture. Try to keep the photos as consistent as possible. Keep the subject under direct supervision until sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency is regained.\n5. Measurement of leg excursion as a functional outcome of fibrosis\nStarting from third week after irradiation, plan to have measurements each week for up to 6 weeks.\nInitiate and maintain the anesthesia as described above. Prepare a field in front of the nose cone and fix a protractor with tape in the center (Figure 4A).\nTransfer the mouse to the field and gently place its nose on the cone. Position the right knee to the protractor's center (Figure 4B).\nKeep the knee fixed using the left hand and use the right hand to dorsiflex the foot with the index and pollex fingers (Figure 4C,D).",
    "Note the degree of extension by reading the value indicated by the toes. Perform the same procedure on the contralateral non-irradiated leg.\n6. Measurement of gait functional index\n3D-print the rodent walking track to create a 40 cm walking path suspended at a height of 15 cm with a transparent floor (Figure 5). Place a video recorder underneath the track and start filming. The camera is adjusted to record a video at the highest possible resolution and at a minimum frame rate of 60 frames per second.\nOpen one end of the track and transfer the mouse inside. Let the animal walk freely on the track. Capture the animal walking as smoothly as possible at least three times.\nCheck the quality of the video before recording the next mouse.\nTransfer the videos to a computer with a video player, screenshot application, an image processing program, and spreadsheet software. Watch the recordings to capture three different, clear footprints using the screenshot function (Figure 6).\nOpen the image processing program for toe spread measurements. Select File from the upper panel and click Open to find and display the image to analyze.\nSelect Straight Line Tool from the second row of the upper panel (Figure 7_1). Using this tool, mark the wall width and click Analyze > Set Scale, then enter the exact value for a known distance to calibrate the scale (Figure 7_2-5).\nUse the Straight Line Tool to mark the footprint for different measurements (Figure 6C, D; 1: foot length, 2: outer toe spread, 3: inner toe spread), select Analyze > Measure, and record the length value (Figure 8).\nPerform the analyses for both the irradiated and non-irradiated limbs. Use the following equation published previously to assess the functionality24\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64251/64251eq01.jpg",
    "where SFI = sciatic functionality index, E = experimental or injured paw, N = normal or uninjured paw, TS = toe spread, and PL = print length.\n7. Euthanasia\nTransfer the subject to a CO2 line-connected box. Start the CO2 infusion to reach 30%-70% concentration within the chamber. For a 5 L chamber, the gas infusion must be between 1.5-3.5 L/min.\nWait for the animal to cease respiration for 5-10 min. Euthanize by cervical dislocation via holding the head in place from the skull base and firmly pulling the tail25.\n8. Histology and downstream analyses 17\nPull the irradiated hind limb to prepare it for excision. Select a 2 cm x 1 cm area to the posterior plane of the extremital skin.\nUse pair of sharp scissors to carefully collect the skin sample. Cut the tissue in half from the long axis to obtain two separate pieces.\nFix one tissue piece in 10% formalin buffered saline. Process the fixed tissue for preparing histological sections on slides.\nTransfer the second piece to a box filled with dry ice to preserve the proteins and RNA. Then, quickly transfer the tissue samples to a -80 °C freezer and keep them frozen until further processing.\nStain the slides for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain and Masson's Trichrome stain. Visualize the stained slides under a microscope and take images using 10x magnification. Measure the epithelium thickness using image processing software as explained above for the gait functional assay.\n9. Statistics\nPresent the data as mean ± standard deviation. Evaluate the results using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni's multi-comparison test or Student t-test.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
