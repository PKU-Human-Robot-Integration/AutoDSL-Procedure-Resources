    "This protocol is a standard procedure suggested by the EU guidelines (2010/63) and the European Society for Fish Models in Biology and Medicine (EuFishBioMed) in Karlsruhe Insitute of Technology (KIT). All methods described after here have been approved by the ethics commission (Landesdirektion Dresden; document number TVV-52/2015).\n1. Preparation of Aβ42 Peptide\nSynthesize peptides (see Table 1) using the standard 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry with 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronoiumhexafluorphosphate (HBTU) as the coupling reagent on an automated solid-phase peptide synthesizer52. The scale of the synthesis was 100 µmol.\nLoad the automated peptide synthesizer with 500 mg of the Fmoc-protected resin as the solid phase (loading capacity of 0.2 mmol/g). Load the dissolved Fmoc-protected amino acids at a concentration 0.5 M in the volume required and as calculated for the respective synthesizer.\n\tNOTE: The calculations are made to enable the coupling of each Fmoc-protected amino acid twice with 5 times excess of each building block to the resin47.\nDissolve the required reagents for peptide synthesis in dimethlyformamide (DMF). For example, prepare the activator, HBTU, at a concentration of 0.48 M, 45% v/v N-Methylmorpholine (NMM) (the base), and 5% v/v Acetic Anhydride (the capping mixture) to cap the non-reacted amino groups.\nCleave all the peptides from the resin by continuously mixing the solid support using an agitator in a freshly prepared cleavage mixture consisting of Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA): Triisopropylsilane(TIS): water: Dithiothreitol (DTT) at 90 (v/v): 5 (v/v): 2.5 (v/v): 2.5 (m/v), for 4 h. Use 10 mL for the synthesis scale of 100 µmol.\nPrecipitate the cleaved product by adding the cleavage mixture to 100 mL ice-cold diethyl ether. Pass through a filtration unit containing a Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter with a pore size of 0.45 µm and wash with 20 mL ice-cold diethyl ether.",
    "Collect the filtered peptide from the filter paper and dissolve 100 mg of precipitated peptide in 5 mL distilled deionized water: acetonitrile at 1:1.\nPurify via reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a semi-preparative HPLC equipped with a porous polystyrene divinylbenzene column of bead size 10 µm.\nPre-heat the column and maintain at 50 °C using a column heating device. Collect all the major fractions using an automated fraction collector by applying a gradient from 5% to 100% solvent B over 25 min at 4 mL/min.\n\t\tNOTE: Solvent A is 0.1% TFA in water and solvent B is 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile52.\nMonitor the chromatogram at 220 nm, collect the appropriate peaks, and analyze using the LC-MS.\nConfirm the purity by analytical reverse phase ultra-high Pressure Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) at 220 nm by monitoring with a UV Detector while passing the sample through an analytical C18 column (bead size 1.7 µm). Confirm the peptide product by mass spectrometry.\n\tNOTE: The UPLC is coupled to an electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and Tandem Quadrupole Detector.\nLyophilize the correct fractions of the desired peptide in a round bottom flask, by applying a vacuum of 0.052 mbar, to a fluffy powder. Couple the vacuum pump to a freezing unit maintained at -78 °C. Store at -80 °C, indefinitely.\nUse the lyophilized peptide to prepare a stock solution of 1 mM in a mixture of acetonitrile: DMF: analytical grade water at 1:1:1 for the experiments. This solution can be stored for at least 6 months, as the peptides do not aggregate in this solution.\n2. Preparation of the Injection Mixture\nPrepare phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 2 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4) for diluting the lyophilized peptides.",
    "Dissolve the peptide to a final concentration of 20 µM in PBS. Prepare this solution fresh. Mix well and store on ice until the injection. Do not exceed 30 min to prevent aggregation in solution.\n3. Anesthesia\nPrepare the stock solution of the anesthetics, 0.1% ethyl-m-aminobenzoate methanesulphonate (MESAB), in regular fish water from the circulating system. Prepare the anaesthetization solution to a final concentration of 0.0025% (v/v).\nRemove the desired number of fish from their tanks into a transport container with 5 L of system water.\nHalf-fill a plastic Petri dish (90 mm) with 40 mL anesthetics. Use this dish for injections.\nIncubate the fish in the anesthetics until the opercular movement has ceased.\n4. Cerebroventricular Microinjection\nPreparation of injection apparatus\nPrepare the glass injection capillaries using a needle puller with the following parameters: heating cycle, 537; pulling cycle, 250; velocity, 1.5 s; time, 80 ms.\nBring the pressure setting on the pressure source to 25 psi.\nSet the microinjector parameters to the following: hold pressure 20 psi; eject pressure 10 psi; period value 2.5; gating value 100 ms.\nLoad the glass capillary with the injection solution. Insert the glass capillary into the microinjection holder. Adjust the injection angle to 45°.\n\t\tNOTE: More detailed protocols can be found as described in references27,46.\nPlace one fish into a new Petri dish filled with anaesthetization solution (as in step 3.3).\nHold the fish with the forceps and orient for injection.\nGenerate a slit using the tip of a 30 G needle in the skull over the optic tectum where the two lateral plates meet. Do not insert the tip into the brain tissue, this would cause bleeding and damage. See references27,45,46 for additional details.\nInsert the glass capillary into the slit.",
    "Use only the tip of the needle and do not penetrate more than 1 mm through the skull.Keep holding the fish and insert the tip of the glass capillary through the incision site.\nOrient the tip of the glass capillary towards the telencephalon at a 45° angle. Inject 1 µL of the solution. The liquid disperses immediately after injection.\n5. Recovery\nPlace the fish back to a transport container until it recovers. Connect the container to the regularly circulating fish water to ensure optimum water quality.\n\tNOTE: The recovery should normally take 1 min. If it takes longer, the fish must be kept in the anesthetics for a shorter time (this needs to be optimized by the experimenter).\n6. Tissue Preparation and Sectioning\nWait for a desired period of time before sacrificing the fish.\n\tNOTE: This depends on the experimental question. Amyloid deposition can be seen as early as 1 day after injection.\nSacrifice the fish using the appropriate method depending on the ethical regulations (e.g., treat the fish with 0.1 M MESAB).\nCut open the skull above the optic tectum using pointed forcep on the dorsal side, and dissect the head just behind the pectoral fin using a scalpel.\nFix the heads using 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight at 4 °C. Use 3 mL of PFA per head in a plastic tube with a screw lid.\n\tCAUTION: Wear the appropriate personal protective equipment when handling PFA.\nFor cryoprotection and decalcification, wash the heads thrice in 0.1M Phosphate Buffer (pH 7.4), then transfer them into 20% sucrose/20% ethylenediaminetetraacetic (EDTA) solution and incubate overnight at 4 °C.",
    "To embed the tissue into sectioning resin, freeze the heads in 7.5% gelatin/20% sucrose solution in plastic histology molds on dry ice (approximately 3-5 min to freeze a block). Store the samples at -80 °C or continue to the next step (cryosectioning).\nSection the heads into 12 µm thick cryosections using a cryostat as described28,42. Transfer the cryosections directly onto glass slides and store at -20 °C for long-term usage.\n7. Immunohistochemical Staining and Microscopy\nNOTE: Perform all incubation steps in a humidified chamber. And, all the washing steps are for 10 min each.\nDry the sections for 30 min at room temperature. After thawing, wash the sections twice in PBS and once in PBSTx (PBS with 0.03% Triton-X-100).\nIncubate with the primary antibody (anti-Aβ42 antibody; 1:500 dilution in PBSTx) at 4 °C overnight.  Following day, wash once in PBS and twice in PBSTx.\nIncubate the sections with the secondary antibody (fluorescence-coupled detection, 1:500 dilution) along with DAPI (1 μg/mL) in PBSTx for 2 h at room temperature.\nWash three times in PBSTx. After the final washing, mount the slides with a coverslip  using 100 μL 70% glycerol.\nAcquire fluorescent images using a confocal microscope (for example with 20X PL APO N.A. 0.7 objective with 488 excitation range and a standard green filter; Figure 2)39.\nSubscription Required.
