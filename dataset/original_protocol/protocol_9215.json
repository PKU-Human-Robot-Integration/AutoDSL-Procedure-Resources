    "1. Materials \n1. Suspension Box\nThe tail-suspension test (TST) involves suspending mice above the ground by their tails. At the most basic level, the procedure only requires a suspension bar or shelf ledge, and tape. However, the experimenter should consider the use of a background that provides optimal contrast. Additionally, it is prudent to take steps to prevent mice from observing other animals that are being tested. In our laboratory, we use specially manufactured tail suspension boxes (Four-Hour Day, Baltimore MD), made of plastic with the dimensions (55 height X 60 width X 11.5 cm depth). In order to prevent animals from observing or interacting each other, each mouse is suspended within its own three-walled rectangular compartment (55 height X 15 width X 11.5 cm depth). The mouse is suspended in the middle of this compartment and the width and depth are sufficiently sized so that the mouse cannot make contact with the walls. In this setting, the approximate distance between the mouse's nose and the apparatus floor is 20-25 cm. There are four such identical compartments in the apparatus allowing us to test four mice at a time. An aluminum suspension bar (1 cm. height X 1 cm. width x 60 cm. length), used to suspend the tail of each mouse, is positioned on the top of the box. The dimensions that we use in our laboratory should be regarded as a general reference. For example, the size of individual compartments of the tail-suspension box can be increased if a large outbred mouse strain (e.g. CD-1) is used.",
    "At the bottom of each compartment we place a detachable aluminum tray that collects feces or urine from the animals. We use a dark grey box for albino animals and a cream colored box for mice of other coat colors. This arrangement gives us better contrast and therefore more reliable behavioral scoring of the test.\n2. Tape\nTape should adhere securely to both the mouse’s tail and the suspension bar, and be strong enough to carry the weight of the mouse being tested (e.g. TimeMed Labeling Systems, Inc, Burr Ridge IL, 1.9 cm width). However, the tape should not be excessively sticky since at the end of the session it will be removed from the tail. We cut 17 cm fragments of tape and place a mark 2 cm from one end. This 2 cm portion was used for attaching the tape to the tail, while the remaining 15 cm was used for suspension of the mouse.\n3. Timer\n4. Video recording device\nA video camera and a tripod (or other support structure) are needed. Since this test usually involves multiple animals being tested at the same time, live scoring will be difficult and is not advised. The video camera should record in high enough resolution to render a quality picture that will be used later for behavioral scoring. Always make certain that there is sufficient recording memory in the camera before starting the test. We use a video camera that records digitally without the use of physical media (i.e. video cassette), allowing for straightforward transfer of videos. \n5. White noise generator",
    "The noise generator should mask intermittent environmental sounds. The use of a noise generator is particularly recommended in laboratory environments where sudden loud noises can be heard that would potentially startle mice. In our experimental room the ambient noise level (without the white noise generator activated) is around 60 dB. The total sound level with the white noise generator activated at the location where the TST is conducted is 70-72 dB. However, it should be noted that these figures are provided as example only, and each laboratory should select the right noise levels according to their unique environment and circumstances.\n6. Cleaning supplies\nThe suspension box should be wiped thoroughly after each session with a sterilization solution (e.g. MB-10, Quip Laboratories Inc., Wilmington, DE, or similar).\n7. Climbstoppers (optional: dependent upon strain used)\nMice of some backgrounds, such as C57BL/6, may climb their tails during the test1. Clear hollow  cylinders (4 cm length, 1.6 cm outside diameter, 1.3 cm inside diameter, 1.5 grams) that are cut to four cm length (by FourHourDay Inc, Baltimore MD) from polycarbonate tubing (#8585K41, McMaster-Carr, Santa Fe Springs, CA) are placed around the tails of  mice to prevent such tail climbing behavior2,3. These devices can be made in any laboratory with common tools and materials. \n2. Behavioral Procedures\nThe overall experimental design should reflect proper counterbalancing between variables specific to your experiment. For example, in our experiments we try to represent each group equally in every TST session (i.e., if there are four treatment groups, each will be represented in each session). Also, the positions of mice are rotated in a way such that mice from each treatment group are placed in a different position in each session.",
    "Place the camera in position. The camera should be as close as possible in order to obtain the highest possible resolution of the animals.\nTape fragments that will be used during the session should be cut, marked, and prepared for the session.\nStart the white noise generator, if being used, before the mice are introduced to the testing room. The level of white noise should only be enough to mask external noises. Avoid a high volume and make sure the same level of white noise is used for all animals.\nBring the animals into the testing room. If the room where the animals reside and the testing room are adjacent to each other with similar ambient conditions, no acclimation period may be necessary. Otherwise, place the animals in the testing room for a period of acclimation (generally at least one hour). Be aware that the other animals placed in the same room can sense olfactory and ultrasonic cues.\nIf a strain known to climb their tails, such as C57BL6/J, is being used place Climbstoppers around the tails prior to applying the tape.\nAdhere the tape to the tails of mice. Use the marked end of the tape and make sure the tape sticks to the tail and back on itself. The tape should be applied to the very end of the tail with 2-3 millimeters of tail remaining outside of the tape. \nOnce each piece of tape is attached to a mouse tail stick the middle portion of the tape to the inner walls of the cage. This will help prevent tangling of tape pieces to each other. Note that confinement in this fashion may cause stress and that it is important to complete the process of applying the tape to each animal as soon as possible.",
    "Once all tape is applied, start the recording and identify the session before the mice are suspended.\nSuspend the animals by placing the free end of the tape on the suspension bar or shelf in an order that is counterbalanced between treatment groups. Suspend mice in a way that is does not obstruct the camera view because the entire TST session will be scored and obstructing the camera will lead to the inability to assess behaviors during that time. Check that all tape ends are hanging parallel to the suspension bar or shelf with a similar length of slack for each mouse. \nAt the end of the session (which is typically six minutes), return the animals to their homecage and carefully remove the tape from each tail by gently pulling it off. Do not rip the tape from the tail since doing so may cause pain to the mice. \nAfter returning the mice to their colony room discard the fecal boli and urine from the collection trays and wipe the apparatus with a sterilizing solution. \n3. Behavior Analysis\nGenerally, the TST is from start to finish six minutes in length. Unlike another widely used antidepressant efficacy procedure, the forced swim test, the whole session is scored. This is due to the general finding that mice tend to manifest immobility earlier in the TST.\nIn our laboratory we upload the video files directly from the camera to a PC where the analysis is conducted.\nDuring the behavioral analysis the time that each mouse spends as mobile is measured. While it is possible to measure the immobility time directly, we have found it easier to detect and measure active movements rather than the lack of such movements.",
    "The most important aspect of TST behavioral analysis is the consistent identification of movements that are recorded as bona fide mobility. Mice, especially at the beginning of the session, manifest behaviors that are overtly escape related. These include trying to reach the walls of the apparatus and the suspension bar, strong shaking of the body, and movement of the limbs akin to running. These movements clearly constitute mobility. These behaviors then subside and become subtler. In our laboratory small movements that are confined to the front legs but without the involvement of the hind legs are not counted as mobility. Additionally, oscillations and pendulum like swings that are due to the momentum gained during the earlier mobility bouts also are not counted as mobility.\nIn our laboratory we use an on-screen stopwatch software for time measurements (Xnote Stopwatch, dnSoft Research Group). Two separate stopwatches are used on the screen. The first stopwatch counts down from 360 seconds and alerts the observer when the behavioral analysis period ends. The second stopwatch —controlled by the observer—measures the time spent mobile. Certain stopwatch software has the ability to assign keys to start and stop functions, so that on-screen the keyboard can control the stopwatch. Instead of a regular keyboard, we use an input device commonly known as a 'gamepad' to control the stopwatches. \nIf there is more than one mouse tested and present on the screen it is a good idea to cover the other animals so that their movements will not distract the observer. This can be accomplished by using another program window or by physically covering the other mice on the screen with paper.",
    "There may be some bias occurring if the total amount of mobility time elapsed for a particular mouse is visible prior to completion of the analysis session. If an on-screen stopwatch is used, we suggest to cover all but the millisecond decimals of the stopwatch. By covering the stopwatch the observer only knows whether the stopwatch is on or off at any point but does not know the total time elapsed and therefore cannot be affected by any bias. Using this approach the observer, while blind to the group assignments of the animals, will not have a general idea of level of mobility in each animal.\nAn interobserver reliability test should be conducted for every new observer before beginning to collect data from test animals. In our laboratory each new observer first watches an experienced observer while he or she is scoring. After the new observers gain enough confidence to differentiate mobility from immobility, they then score in real time with the experienced observer watching and pointing out any mistakes. Once this phase is successfully completed, the new observers will analyze a specific set of TST videos that we maintain in our laboratory for training purposes. Only after a high level of interobserver correlation is obtained with the experienced observer does an investigator analyze TST videos from actual experiments. We archive the data from these training analyses to constitute an internal standard for the laboratory. We have observed differences between strains in the manner in which they express mobility (and immobility) behaviors, and mean immobility time between sexes. When a new strain, sex, or genetically modified mouse model is tested in the laboratory it is necessary to again undertake this type of reliability analysis.  \n4. Representative Results",
    "We have used the TST to assess antidepressant-like responses to lithium treatment in various mouse strains (Figure 1)3. Experimental details of this experiment are published in Can et al., 20113. \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3769/3769fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.  Immobility time in the tail suspension test after chronic lithium administration in five inbred mouse strains. Mice were group housed, four mice per cage. Mice in the lithium treatment group received lithium chow containing 4 g/kg LiCl for three weeks. Control animals received identical food without the lithium chloride. **:p<0.01, ***:p<0.001 denote a significant, unpaired t-test. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. n:10-12 animals per group for each strain. (figure reproduced from 3).\nIn this example, a significant treatment effect of chronic lithium delivered in food is observed only in C57BL/6J and DBA/2J strains. In the other three strains, no statistically significant decrease in immobility time was observed. These data indicate that an antidepressant-like response to chronic lithium treatment is strain dependent as has also been observed with other antidepressant medications4-8.Subscription Required.
