    "Preparation of ligand-coated Dynabeads20 µl of Dynabeads Protein A is washed with 1 ml of PBS (see Recipes) in a microtube.Note: The standard procedure can be scaled up for multiple samples.Beads are collected using Magnetic Separation Rack.The solution is removed from the beads.The beads are resuspended in 100 µl of PBS.2 µl of 100 ng/µl DLL4-Fc/PBS (see Recipes) or JAG1-Fc/PBS (see Recipes) is added to the tubeThe beads are incubated for 20 min at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C using a tube rotator (Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Dynabeads Protein A was incubated at room temperature using a tube rotator. Note that Dynabeads have brown color in the video.Beads are collected using a Magnetic Separation Rack.The solution is removed from the beads.Beads are washed 3 times with 1 ml of PBS.The solution is removed from the beads.100 µl of PBS is added to the tube.Just before use, 900 µl of ice-cold complete culture media is added to the tube.Preparation of Notch-expressing cellsHEK293T cells are seeded in a 6-well plate at 6 x 105 cells per well in complete culture media (see Recipes).Next day, the culture media are replaced with 800 µl of Opti-MEM.Cells are incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator.Plasmid DNA (2 µg) is diluted into 200 µl of Opti-MEM in a microtube.Note: To identify transfected cells, GFP expression vector (e.g., pMAX-GFP) is included at 1/8 amount of total plasmids.The tube is vortexed gently.6 µl of 1 mg/ml PEI solution (see Recipes) is added to the DNA solution.The mixture is incubated for 30 min at room temperature.The DNA/PEI mixtures are gently dropped onto each well of the plate.Cells are incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator.The culture media are replaced with 2 ml of complete culture media.",

The fixed cells were washed with PBS for using an orbital rotator PBS is removed from the culture plate using aspirator (Video 3).Note: The beads accumulated in the center of each well can be removed using aspirator.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 3. PBS was removed from the culture plate using aspirator Cells are washed 5 times in total by repeating steps C5 and C6.1 ml of PBS is added to each well of the dish (Figure 2I).Phase contrast and fluorescence images are captured using FSX100 (Figure 3).The number of bound beads on GFP-positive cell is counted (Figure 4).Note: 50 GFP-positive cells were counted for quantification. Floating beads were excluded for counting.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171016/20171016005119_9698.jpgFigure 3. Counting of Dynabeads-bound cells. A-C.",

HEK293T cells or cells transiently transfected with Notch1 with or without Eogt, were incubated with DLL4 or JAG1 beads. The number of Dynabeads bound per transfected cell marked by GFP expression was determined (n = 50). Data are mean ± SD from three independent experiments. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; bar by Welch’s t-test."
