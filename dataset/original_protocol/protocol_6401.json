    "Note: For all procedures approval should be obtained from the appropriate animal use committees.Part I: Tail-skin transplantationNote: Perform all procedures as sterilely as possible. References: Schmaler et al. (2014); Jayachandran et al. (2019). Preparation of surgeryAll instruments and materials (surgical equipments, cotton swab, gauze), should be autoclaved.Prepare and organize instruments and materials as mentioned in Materials and Reagents section A1-A22 and Equipment section A1-A8, B1-B2 as well as turn on the anesthesia mobil unit (Figure 1A) and warm up the heating pad (Figure 1B).Open the finger strip bandages and apply Vaseline on the wound pad (use a cotton swab ensuring the gauze is covered) (Figure 1C).Prepare 10-15 cm strips of leukotape per mouse (Figure 1D).Administer analgesia: Buprenorphine 0.05 mg/kg body weight is administered intraperitoneally using an insulin syringe post dilution in PBS in a volume of 100 μl (weigh the mouse!) to ensure analgesia immediately after the surgery.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200216/20200216100645_9421.jpgFigure 1. Preparation of the material for the surgery. The surgical set-up prepared for skin transplant surgery: anesthesia mobile unit (A) and warm pad (B). The Hansaplast plaster is coated with Vaseline on the non-adhesive area with a cotton swabs (C). 10-15 cm of leukotape strips are prepared (D).Preparation of the tail-skin for transplantationDonor mice [e.g., H2-bm12 (H-2bm12) (McKenzie et al., 1979)] are euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation.Disinfect the tails with 70% ethanol.Place the animal on a surgical board with its tail black stripe facing down. Dissect the tail longitudinally throughout the mid-line (here marked with a marker to make it easier to see Figure 2A).Make a circular incision at the proximal end of the tail and a superficial incision only involving the skin layer starting from the proximal to the distal end.",
    "Use a tissue forceps to peel off the tail skin starting from the proximal site (where the circular incision is seen (Figure 2B) to the distal end (Figure 2C) and transfer the tail skin into a 10 cm Petri dish with 10 ml of PBS (Figure 2D).Using a scalpel, make a transplant to match the size of the incision done on the dorsal part of the recipient (see Figure3), make a round/circle using the scalpel (Figures 2E-2G).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200216/20200216100705_6435.jpgFigure 2. Donor tail skin graft preparation. A. The tail donor is dissected from the proximal to the distal end with a scalpel. The skin of the tail is pulled off from the proximal (B) to the distal end (C). D. The donor tail skin graft is stored in sterile PBS. A piece of the graft is dissected using a scalpel (E) and reshaped on the corners (F) then placed on the scalpel blade for placement in to graft bed prepared on the recipients’ dorsal skin (G).Surgical ProcedureThe recipient mouse (e.g., C57BL/6, H-2b) is anesthetized by inhalation of a 3% Isofluorane solution (it should take 3-5 min to reach surgical plane anesthesia) in a closed chamber. Once anesthetized, vitamin A ointment is applied to the eyes to prevent corneal dryness while under anesthesia.Transfer the mouse to the cushioned warm pad maintained at 37 °C and apply 1.5% Isofluorane via a mouth mask (check the reflexes by toe pinching to make sure the mouse is properly anesthetized).The dorsal site of the recipient mouse skin (e.g., C57BL/6), about 2 cm below the ear line is shaved (3 cm2 area) and any hairs removed using a dry gauze swab (Figure 3A).Use betadine solution to disinfect the transplantation site using a cotton swab (Figure 3B).",
    "Lift the skin upwards using forceps in the middle/right site of the dorsum and make a round incision using curved scissors (~ 1 cm x 0.6 cm) (Figure 3C).Immediately clean the wound when bleeding occurs (using a sterile cotton swab).Dry off any excess PBS using a sterile cotton swab and place the transplant onto the recipient mouse (use a scalpel) (Figure 3E).Use tissue adhesive (Histoacryl) to fix the transplant (only on the contact zone) to the recipient skin avoiding any overlap of donor and host skin (Figure 3F).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200216/20200216100731_3371.jpgFigure 3. Preparation of the dorsal part of the recipient mouse for surgical implantation of the donor tail skin. The recipient mouse is placed under the anesthetic mask and its dorsal skin is shaven (A) and cleaned with Betadine (B). The dorsal skin is grasped with a blunt end forceps and a small area of skin about 1 cm2 is snipped of with a curved scissor (C). The graft bed is prepared to host the recipients’ dorsal skin (D). The donor tail graft is gently placed (E) within the surgical opening created on the dorsal surface of the recipient and glued with the surrounding dorsal skin using Histoacryl without any overlapping on recipient’s skin (F).Protection of the graft after surgeryOnce the Histoacryl dries up (1-2 min), cover up the surgical site with a plaster. Carefully wrap a plaster (Hansaplast Finger Strips, no creases) around the mouse waist (see Figures 4A-4B).Fix the plaster using an adhesive non-elastic bandage to the mouse (3 mm shifted posteriorly relative to the anterior margin of the Hansaplast plaster) (Figures 4C-4D).To prevent the mouse’s teeth to be trapped during the recovery phase, make a ~3 mm incision in the upper ventral site of the bandage (Figure 4E).",
    "When fully recovered the transplanted mice are transferred to their cages and mobility is assessed (Figure 4F) (bandage should not be too tight; if the bandage is too loose or too tight, remove the old bandage (under anesthesia) and reapply the bandage). At this point, the animals receive wet food until bandage removal.Sterilize all instruments (70% ethanol) prior to performing the subsequent surgery.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200216/20200216100815_5370.jpgFigure 4. Protection of the graft after surgery. For plaster application, a Hansaplast plaster that has been generously coated with Vaseline on the non-adhesive area is gently layered on top of the graft and rounded up along the girth of the abdomen (A-B). Subsequently, another layer of Leukotape (white in the figure) bandage is applied to firmly fix the graft in place (C-D). A 3 mm incision in the upper ventral site of the bandage (E). The mouse is placed back in a transitional cage under a red lamp to warm up and allowed to wake up (F).Post-operative CareAnalgesia is provided by using paracetamol-containing syrup in the drinking water (4 mg/ml) for 7 days.Once fully recovered, as judged by alertness and mobility, the mouse can be returned to the animal room. This takes usually ~30 min; Housing can be in either single or grouped cages.Transplanted mice should be monitored for behavioral changes (eating or immobility), abnormal appearance (lack of grooming) or posture (pilo-erection or hunched posture) for the time the bandage is in place (1 week). If animals are unable to move (e.g., trapped bandage), re-apply the bandage under anesthesia.Bandage removal (6-7 days post-transplantation)Initiate anesthetizing the mouse through inhalation of a 3% Isofluorane solution.Remove the bandage and plaster by carefully dissecting these using an artery scissor while avoiding disturbance of the transplant site.",
    "Monitor the mice for signs of discomfort (crouching, immobility, alertness, eye discharge and fur changes) and score the transplanted skin for signs of rejection (Figure 5). In case of discomfort or infection, antibiotics can be administered.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200216/20200216101014_5410.jpgFigure 5. Scoring of the skin grafts. The images represent a skin piece of approximately 1 cm in diameter.Part II: Lymphoid organ analysis (Lang et al., 2017)Preparation of cells suspensionsIsolation of the lymphoid organsEuthanize the mice with CO2, pin each paw of the mouse using a needle (25 G) to a Styrofoam board (Figure 6A), open the skin in the middle of the abdomen (Figure 6B, arrow) to make an incision through the all body (double Y forms: Figure 6C), and detach the skin from the peritoneal membrane. Use needles (25 G) to fix the skin to the styrofoam board (Figure 6D)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200216/20200216101038_8983.jpgFigure 6. Opening of the mouse skin. A.
