    "Basic Protocol 1 Mannan-induced skin inflammation Epicutaneous application of 50 μL of mannan mixture with incomplete Freund’s        adjuvant at the back of the BALB/c female mice for three days induces psoriasis-like        skin inflammation. Monitoring skin redness, scales, and thickness daily for        7–9 days or until the inflammation subsides using the scoring protocol        described in Support Protocol 1 is essential. Before starting any animal experiment,        apply for and get valid ethical permits from ethical review boards of respective        institutions/regions.Protocol steps—step annotations Preparation of mannan stock solution Dissolve the mannan powder (5 g/vial) by gently adding 2 mL of sterile PBS            and then transfer all the contents into a 50 mL centrifuge tube, adding            another 48 mL of PBS to get a 100 mg/mL concentration.Note: Avoid foam formation, though occasional shaking of the              solution is required to dissolve the powder completely. Aliquot and label the mannan solution in sterile 10 mL tubes and freeze them            at -20 °C until used.Note: Mannan solution at 100 mg/mL concentration is stable for over              12 months if stored at -20 °C. Epicutaneous application of mannan for psoriasis induction To get consistent results, 8–12-week-old BALB/c female mice (5–10            mice/group) from specific pathogen-free breeding centers are required.            Acclimatize the mice for at least one week before starting the experiment.Use at least five mice per cage in a climate-controlled environment with            12:12 h light/dark cycles; provide food and water ad libitum.Use mice epicutaneously treated with PBS on the back, similarly to the mannan            application (minimum five mice), for control.Thaw 1 mL of mannan-PBS solution, previously stored in the freezer, at room            temperature for 15 min.Note: Avoid frequent freeze-thaw cycles. The volume of mannan thawed              depends on the number of mice used in an experiment. Remove the hair from the mouse skin at the back (2.0 cm × 3.",
    "5 cm area)            first by using a small mouse shaver, which has a 2.4 cm wide blade that can            cut as close as 0.1 mm to the skin.Note: Avoid making wounds on the skin surface. Use the hair removal cream to remove the remaining hair from the specified            area of the mouse skin. Take the hair removal cream on a smooth plastic            plate and then smear the cream on the surface of the skin. Wait for 20 min            and finally remove the cream from the hair using a paper towel.Accurately weigh the mice and give an intraperitoneal injection of 80 mg/mL            phenobarbital-normal saline solution to anesthetize mice.Note: The weight of mice is measured in grams and accurate to one              decimal place, and intraperitoneal injection of phenobarbital-normal              saline solution should be no more than 200 μL in volume. Mix 100 μL of mannan-PBS solution (50 mg/mL) with IFA (100 μL) and            apply mannan + IFA mixture for each mouse. Place mannan-PBS solution at the            bottom of a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube, and then add IFA gently; use a pipette            to mix mannan-PBS and IFA until the mixture becomes an emulsion. Treat at            least five mice with the prepared mixture and use another five mice treated            with PBS as a control.Note: Mannan and IFA mixture need to be prepared before each              experiment, and homogeneous mixture preparation is required before              application on the back of mice to get reproducible results. Smear the mixture on the back of the mouse uniformly using a cotton swab            pre-soaked in PBS.Note: Apply a thin layer of the mixture on the skin and avoid              applying the mixture too much to any one place. Use a fine brush              (natural or synthetic, but not foam) for application.",
    "Applying a higher              concentration (10 mg) of mannan leads to acute inflammatory reactions,              and the scales will peel off quickly, hence not optimal for psoriasis              induction. Repeat steps B8 and B9 for three consecutive days.Note: Apply mannan-IFA mixture at 9:00–10:00 am for three              days. Remember to apply mixture at 24-hour intervals. Score the psoriasis lesions daily by following Support Protocol 1.Note: The disease progression and scoring start 48 h after mannan              treatment for the first time and should be monitored every 24 h for 9              days. Observe redness, scales, and thickness from day 2 onwards. Redness              and scales are typically apparent after days 3 and 4, respectively.              These psoriasis symptoms reach maximum severity on day 5, and the mice              gradually start recovering from day 7 onwards. In most inbred mouse              strains (BALB/c, C57Bl/6J, C57Bl/6NQ, KM, DBA/1, ICR, and NIH), signs of              inflammation could be observed in naïve mice exposed to mannan              under experimental conditions described herein (Wu et al., 2022 and              2023). Support Protocol 1 Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scoring protocol After mannan application, mice should be inspected daily for disease            symptoms, as shown in Figures            1–5. PASI involves scores for redness (0–4), scales            (0–4), and thickness (0–4). The standard of PASI scoring was            reported earlier (Van der Fits et al., 2009). The total score of PASI            (maximum disease severity) per mouse is 12, as shown in the psoriasis            inflammation scoring protocol (Table 1). Score redness and            scales visually and measure skin thickness using a digital vernier caliper.Table 1. Scoring standards of PASI for psoriasis inflammation in mice table:",

    "Protocol steps—step annotations Gently take each mouse from its cage and observe the back of the mice                for psoriasis progression.Note: The critical components of the PASI scoring are                  outlined in Table 1. Evaluate the redness using a 0–4 scale for mannan and                PBS-applied mice during disease. Example images are given below for                redness scores (Figure                2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4845/bioprotoc-13-20-4845-g002.jpgFigure 2. Scores for redness (0 and 3) are given by observing                      the back skin of the mice. An example is shown in the above figure (n = 10/group).                      BALB/c female mice were used for experiments. Right                      column images with 3 points were reproduced from Figure                      1A of the published paper (Wu et al., 2022).Evaluate the scales using a 0–4 scale for mannan and                PBS-applied mice during disease. Example images are given below for                scoring the scales (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4845/bioprotoc-13-20-4845-g003.jpgFigure 3. An example was given for scale scores (0 and 3) by                      observing the back skin of the BALB/c female mice in                      mannan-induced skin inflammation (MISI) (n = 10/group). The right column picture was reproduced from Figure 1A of                      the published paper (Wu                      et al., 2022).Measure the skin thickness with a caliper daily.Choose the same place and angle on the skin for measuring thickness,                using a digital vernier caliper (0.1 mm = 1 score), above that of                naïve mouse skin, scored as 0 (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4845/bioprotoc-13-20-4845-g004.jpgFigure 4.

Skin thickness is measured using a vernier caliper.Perform scoring procedures daily for psoriasis development (refer to Figure 5                and Table 2                ).Note: The incidence of psoriasis is generally very high (100%) and              consistent from experiment to experiment. However, disease severity is              strain dependent. The most disease-prone strains are BALB/c and C57Bl/6              mice. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4845/bioprotoc-13-20-4845-g005.jpgFigure 5.",

    "Skin starts to show redness from day 1 and scales from day 2 after the mannan-IFA        mixture application, with a maximum psoriasis severity at days 4 or 5. Symptoms of        psoriasis disappear entirely around day 9. A second cycle of exposing the mice to        mannan on days 10–12 induced even more severe psoriasis symptoms than the        first cycle of exposure (Wu et al., 2023).Basic Protocol 2 Imiquimod-induced skin inflammation (IISI) Imiquimod (IMQ) treats keratosis, basal cell carcinoma, and external genital/anal        warts. However, topical treatment with IMQ induced typical psoriasis-like        inflammation, including increased epidermal thickness, erythema, and skin thickness        (Cai et al., 2011). IMQ is a toll-like        receptor-7 and -8 (TLR7 and 8) ligand and can exacerbate psoriasis development in        patients, possibly acting via the IL-17/IL-23 axis.Protocol steps—step annotations Divide IMQ cream from a 250 mg pack into five portions.Note: Preparing equal portions of Aldara cream may sometimes be              challenging to achieve. Hence, careful attention is required to have a              constant amount of IMQ smeared on the back of mice. Thirty-six mice were randomly divided into three groups containing PBS,            mannan, and IMQ groups. Remove the fur using a mouse shaver and hair removal            cream from a 2 cm × 3.5 cm area of the back of the mouse.Note: Avoid making wounds on the skin surface. Accurately weigh the mice and give an intraperitoneal injection of 80 mg/mL            phenobarbital-natural saline solution to anesthetize mice.Note: The weight of mice is measured in grams and accurate to one              decimal place, and intraperitoneal injection of phenobarbital-natural              saline solution should be no more than 200μL in volume. Apply 50 mg of IMQ cream on the back of the mouse from 9:00 to 10:00 am daily            for five days consecutively.Note: Apply the cream at 24 h intervals for five days.",
    "Apply a thin              coat of IMQ cream on the skin and avoid applying too much cream to any              one place. Use a fine brush (natural or synthetic, but not foam) to              apply the IMQ cream. Score mice’s redness, scales, and thickness before applying IMQ using            Support Protocol 1.Notes:  A similar disease course was observed in MISI and IISI, as                  shown in Figure                  6. Individual scores and total PASI in MISI (day 5) and                  IISI (day 5) were given in Table 3. There is negligible weight loss after mannan application,                  while in the IMQ-induced psoriasis model, 12%–15% loss of                  initial weight was observed (Wu et al., 2022). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4845/bioprotoc-13-20-4845-g006.jpgFigure 6.

    "Basic Protocol 3 Histological staining of psoriasis skin Use hematoxylin and eosin staining to assess the skin morphology from                psoriasis and naïve mice. Hematoxylin has a negative charge,                and it is alkaline, which gives it a blue color after binding with                the nucleus. Eosin binds with protein cations so that the cytoplasm                is stained red. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining can show                the epidermis’ hyper-proliferation and immune cell                infiltration in the epidermis and dermis. Determine the epidermal                thickness by measuring the average interfollicular distance under                the microscope in a blinded manner. Histopathological evaluation of                diseased skin sections shows hyperkeratosis and acanthosis,                elongated “rete-like” ridges, and infiltration of immune                cells in the diseased skin.Protocol steps—step annotations Cut a specified area (2 cm × 3.5 cm) of the mouse skin and prepare for            the histology.Fix the skin by submerging it in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h at 4 °C.            Then, cut the skin into 1 cm × 1 cm pieces using scissors and            tweezers.Note: Adequate fixing of the tissues is essential to avoid stiff and              brittle specimens because of dehydration and tissue processing steps.              Several factors (quality of buffer, penetration into tissues, volume,              temperature, concentration, and time) can affect this fixation step. Dehydrate the skin tissues in different concentrations of alcohol for 12 h            using Support Protocol 2.Embed the dehydrated skin in paraffin using 1 cm × 1 cm skin pieces in            a plastic paraffin-embedding cassette.Cut the tissue into 8 mm sections using a tissue microtome at room            temperature.Note: Use longitudinal instead of cross-sectional paraffin sections              and then store them at -20 °C before staining. Stain the skin sections with H&E by using Support Protocol 3.Note: Use plus-loaded slides (for example, FisherbrandTM SuperfrostTM Plus microscope slides) for electrostatic              adherence of tissue sections to the glass without adhesives or protein              coatings.",
    "This step will avoid the loss of tissue sections from the              slides during the staining process. Support Protocol 2 Dehydrate the skin tissues through graded ethanol baths. Next, skin samples            are made transparent in xylene solution, immersed in 75 °C paraffin oil            separately, and embedded in the paraffin-embedding cassettes, which are            stable for many years. Paraffin wax is a mixture of n-alkanes with a carbon            chain length between 20 and 40 that is solid at room temperature but melts            at temperatures between 65 °C and 70 °C.Protocol steps—step annotations Dehydrate the skin samples as follows:Dehydrate in 50% ethanol for 60 min.Dehydrate in 70% ethanol for 120 min.Dehydrate in 80% ethanol for 120 min.Dehydrate in 90% ethanol for 90 min.Dehydrate in 95% ethanol for 90 min.Dehydrate in 95% ethanol for 30 min.Dehydrate in 100% ethanol for 40 min.Dehydrate in 100% ethanol for 30 min.Rehydrate the skin sections in xylene solution with two changes for                10 min each.Immerse the skin sections in 75 °C paraffin oil with two changes                for two hours each.Support Protocol 3 H&E staining of skin samples The H&E stain is one of the primary medical diagnostic stains                performed with formalin-fixed skin samples. This stain gives a                candid picture of the different cells and structures in the skin.                Hematoxylin (a complex of aluminum ions and oxidized hematoxylin)                stains nuclei and keratohyalin granules in blue. The nuclear                membrane will stain dark blue. The counterstain, eosin, gives a                pink/orange color. Eosin stains red blood cells as a dark shade,                muscles, and connective tissues as light orange, and the cytoplasm                as a faint pink. Hematoxylin and eosin may be diluted in water and                ethanol, respectively, as required.",
    "Protocol steps—step annotations Submerge the skin samples in each solution as described below:Deparaffinize the skin sections in xylene solution with two changes                for 10 min each.Rehydrate them in absolute ethanol for 5 min.Rehydrate them in 95% ethanol for 5 min.Rehydrate them in 85% ethanol for 5 min.Rehydrate them in 75% ethanol for 5 min.Wash the slides in flowing water for 3 min.Stain the slides with Mayer’s hematoxylin solution for 8 min.Wash the slides in running tap water for 5 min.Note: Do not stain the sections with excessive hematoxylin;                  if it happens, then wash the slides with 1% H2O2 in 70% ethanol. Counterstain the slides using 0.2% eosin in PBS for 2 min.Dehydrate the slides in 75% ethanol for 5 min.Dehydrate the slides in absolute ethanol for 5 min.Treat the slides with xylene solution, two changes for 5 min each.Mount the slides with a xylene-based mounting medium.Note: Xylene is toxic (Kandyala et              al., 2010), and commercially available alternatives can be used (Falkeholm et al., 2001).              Representative examples of H&E-stained skin sections are shown in Figure 7a              –7c. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4845/bioprotoc-13-20-4845-g007.jpgFigure 7.

However, sample collection methods and different sample        processing procedures for histology, like fixation, dehydration, embedding, and        staining, may alter the tissues, leading to inaccurate thickness measurements.",
    "Hence, control and diseased skin samples collected and processed in the same way        should be measured simultaneously to minimize such issues. Measure the thickness of        the epidermis with a computerized light microscope system (Figure 8), which performs systematic area        measurements in sections. The images thus obtained can be analyzed using an image        analysis software like Image-pro plus.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4845/bioprotoc-13-20-4845-g008.jpgFigure 8.

Choose at            least three images from three different mice for mannan-induced psoriasis            skin. Choose 10 places to estimate the size of the epidermis. Use similar            protocols for PBS and IMQ groups as well. Obtain at least 30 measurements            for the epidermis from each group.
