    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nT cell isolation from peripheral blood\nTiming: 7 h\nCD4+ and CD8+ T cells are magnetically isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) after Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation of peripheral blood (PB) derived from healthy adult donors.\nAlternatives: Other methods of T cell isolation are also suitable, e.g., FACS-sorting.\nFicoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation.\nAliquot 8–15 mL of PB into 50 mL tubes.\nDilute PB with PBS/0.5% BSA to a volume of 35 mL.\nPrepare one 50 mL tube with 10 mL Lymphocyte Separation Media (MS00ZZ1002, Biowest) for each PB tube.\nCarefully overlay the separation media with the diluted PB from step b sustaining clear phase separation. See also troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nCentrifuge at 20°C for 30 min at 400 × g without brake to enable separation of PBMC.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1981-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Phase separation of PB after Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation\nPBMC = Peripheral blood mononuclear cells.\nNote: PB is now separated in four phases. The supernatant is the plasma diluted with PBS/0.5% BSA, followed by the white layer of PBMC, the Lymphocyte Separation Media and a pellet consisting of erythrocytes and granulocytes (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nCarefully pipette the plasma into another 50 mL tube without disturbing the white PBMC layer.\nUse a 1,000 μL pipette to transfer the PBMC into a separate 50 mL tube. The remaining layers can be discarded.\nCritical: Avoid co-transfer of erythrocytes.\nAdd PBS/0.5% BSA until reaching a volume of 50 mL to wash the PBMC.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min with brake.\nDuring centrifugation, the plasma from step 2 can be sterile filtered using a 50 mL syringe capped with a 0.20 μm sterile filter.\nCritical: Store filtered plasma below −20°C. The plasma will be used as cell culture media supplement. See also troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].",
    "Optional: Plasma can be heat inactivated at 56°C for 30 min in a preheated water bath prior to storage as beneficial effects of heat inactivation on T cell proliferation were reported (Fante et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). In our study, we did not perform heat inactivation and the Treg expansion was still efficient.\nOptional: If the PBMC pellet generated in step 5 appears to be red in color, erythrocytes were co-transferred during step 3 and a red blood cell (RBC) lysis step can be performed.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend pellet in RBC lysis buffer and incubate at 20°C for 10 min.\nAdd 30 mL PBS/BSA 0.5%.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min with brake.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend pellet in 7 mL PBS/BSA 0.5%.\nCount the total number of PBMC.\nUse CD4 and CD8 MicroBeads human (130-045-101, 130-045-201, Miltenyi Biotec) together with MS columns (130-042-201, Miltenyi Biotec) and OctoMACS™ separator (130-042-109, Miltenyi Biotec) to magnetically separate CD4+ and CD8+ T cells according to the manufacturer’s protocol[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/upload/assets/IM0001293.PDF].\nCritical: Use at least 66% of total PBMC suspension for CD8+ enrichment to achieve approximately equal numbers of isolated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as CD4+ T cells are more abundant than CD8+ cells in PB.\nAlternatives: If available, also the autoMACS® system can be used for automatic T cell isolation.\nPerform T cell activation using the T Cell Activation/Expansion Kit human (130-091-441, Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s protocol[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/upload/assets/IM0001106.PDF].\nCritical: Use at least 1 × 106 CD4+ and 1 × 106 CD8+ T cells.\nAdditionally, keep at least 1 × 106 CD4+ and 1 × 106 CD8+ T cells for purity assessment in step 12.\nUse a bead-to-cell ratio of 1:2 and follow the T cell activation protocol, following the T cell expansion protocol is not necessary.",
    "Cultivate activated T cells in T cell media 16 h at 37°C and 5% CO2 and saturated humidity.\nPerform flow cytometry with 1 × 106 CD4+ and 1 × 106 CD8+ non-activated T cells (step 11) to check purity of MACS enrichment.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1981-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Exemplary dot plots visualize purity assessment of isolated T cells\nNote: Staining of CD3, CD4 and CD8 is sufficient to discriminate between T cell populations and other cells. Use unstained T cells in comparison to the isolates to set the gates as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nCritical: A minimal purity of 85% is tolerable. See also troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nSeeding of leukemia cells in T cell media\nTiming: 1 h\nOn the day of T cell isolation and activation, seeding of leukemia cells in T cell media should be done in parallel. This allows for equilibration of the cells. Culture leukemia cells and T cells in the same media with plasma supplement from the same donor to avoid any kind of interference between soluble factors from two different donors. We used our established cell culture models SEM::mock and SEM::EGR3 which were generated with the sleeping beauty transposon system. In this system, the transgene is under control of a tetracycline responsive promotor which requires induced transcription the day before co-culture through addition of Doxycycline (Kowarz et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nSeed 2 × 106 SEM::mock and 2 × 106 SEM::EGR3 cells in 2 mL T cell media in a 6-well plate.\nAdd 2 μL of a 1 μg/μL Doxycycline working solution to reach a final concentration of 1 μg/mL in the media.\nCultivate cells 16 h at 37°C and 5% CO2 and saturated humidity.\nCo-culture onset\nTiming: 3 h",
    "The next day, two hours prior to co-culture onset, SEM::mock and SEM::EGR3 cells are treated either with a neutralizing α-ICOSLG antibody or an IgG1 isotype control. EGR3 overexpression fosters ICOSLG transactivation and antibody receptor blockade enables evaluation of the effect of ICOSLG expression on Treg differentiation.\nCount SEM::mock and SEM::EGR3 cells.\nSeed two wells of a 24-well plate with 1 × 106 cells of each cell line in 880 μL T cell media supplemented with 1 μg Doxycycline to sustain transgene expression.\nTreat each cell line with 40 μL of a 0.5 μg/μL working solution of neutralizing α-ICOSLG antibody or IgG1 isotype control to reach a final concentration of 20 μg/mL and cultivate for 2 h at 37°C and 5% CO2 and saturated humidity.\nCount the number of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and adjust to 1,25 × 107 T cells/mL.\nAdd 40 μL CD4+ (=5 × 105 cells) and 40 μL CD8+ (=5 × 105 cells) T cells to each well with SEM cells and carefully mix by pipetting up and down.\nCultivate the co-culture for 48 h at 37°C and 5% CO2 and saturated humidity.\nTreg quantification using flow cytometry\nTiming: 4 h\nThe flow cytometry analysis consists of two different staining batches. Half of the co-culture undergoes a viability staining, the other half a Treg quantification staining. The viability assessment is performed as a surface staining of CD3, CD4 and CD8 followed by Annexin V and 7-AAD. Treg quantification is conducted as a surface staining of CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD25 followed by an intracellular staining of the Treg-specific transcription factor FOXP3.",
    "Note: In our case, flow cytometry was performed using the BD FACSVerse™ flow cytometer with three lasers and four blue, two red and two violet fluorescence channels. The selected antibodies are conjugated with those fluorophores displaying the lowest level of interference and are listed in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]. Please select your own FACS panel that fits your instrument.\nAfter 48 h of co-culture, the whole cell suspension is transferred to a tube and centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 min.\nTransfer each supernatant into another tube and store at −80°C.\nNote: Use the supernatants for subsequent cytokine analysis e.g., using ELISA quantifying IL-2 and IL-10.\nResuspend cell pellet in 100 μL PBS/0.5% BSA.\nAdd 5 μL of Human BD Fc Block (564220, BD Biosciences) and incubate for at least 10 min at 20°C.\nPrepare two antibody master mixes with 5 μL of each antibody in 50 μL Brilliant Stain Buffer (563794, BD Biosciences) according to Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1], mix and dispense among FACS tubes.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1981_5.csv\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1981-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Flow cytometry gating strategy\nFirst, low granularity cells were gated and CD3+ T cells selected to separate CD4+ and CD8+ cells. Following this, viability of these populations was assessed using Annexin V and 7-AAD staining to ensure survival of T cells throughout co-culture. CD25+FOXP3+ Tregs were gated and their percentage among the CD4+ population was quantified. Figure taken from Külp et al. (2022)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8].\nNote: FACS gating of CD25 and FOXP3 requires fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls. Accordingly, prepare two additional Treg FMO staining master mix, one without CD25 and one without FOXP3. These FMO controls will be used to set the gates as shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]. CD3, CD4 and CD8 gates were set at step 11 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).",
    "Add 50 μL of blocked cell suspension to each FACS tube with antibody mix and incubate for 30 min at 20°C protected from light.\nWash by adding 2 mL PBS/0.5% BSA, centrifuge at 400 × g at 20°C for 5 min and discard the supernatant.\nNote: Beginning with the next step, the Viability staining is performed differently to the Treg staining. Both staining can be carried out simultaneously due to incubation times, or successively with cells stored on ice in PBS/0.5% BSA protected from light.\nViability staining.\nWash by adding 2 mL PBS/0.5% BSA, centrifuge at 400 × g at 20°C for 5 min and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend pellet in 100 μL 1× Annexin Binding Buffer (V13246, Invitrogen).\nAdd 5 μL Annexin V Pacific Blue (A35122, Invitrogen).\nIncubate 15 min at 20°C protected from light.\nWash by adding 2 mL PBS/0.5% BSA, centrifuge at 600 × g at 20°C for 6 min and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend in 300 μL 1× Annexin Binding Buffer.\nAdd 3 μL 7-AAD (130-111-568, Miltenyi Biotec).\nIncubate 5–15 min on ice. Avoid an incubation longer than 15 min until flow cytometry.\nPerform flow cytometry with gating as explained in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]. A viability above 70% can be regarded as tolerable.

    "Centrifuge at 600 × g for 6 min at 4°C and discard supernatant.\nResuspend in 80 μL Perm/Wash.\nAdd 5 μL of FOXP3 antibody except to the FOXP3 negative control batch prepared at step 25.\nIncubate at 2°C–8°C for 40–50 min protected from light.\nVortex and wash through addition of 2 mL Perm/Wash.\nCentrifuge at 600 × g for 6 min at 4°C and discard supernatant.\nWash through addition of 2 mL Perm/Wash.\nCentrifuge at 600 × g for 6 min at 4°C and discard supernatant.\nResuspend pellet in 350 μL PBS/0.5% BSA.\nPerform flow cytometry with gating as explained in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nNote: Use the CD25 and FOXP3 negative controls to set the respective gates. CD3, CD4 and CD8 gates were set during T cell isolation (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nCalculate the percentage of the CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ population among the CD4+ population.\nAlternatives: Instead of the BD Biosciences Transcription Factor Buffer Set, the eBioscience Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (Thermo Fisher, 00-5523-00) could also be used.\nAssessment of cytokine levels\nTiming: 7 h\nTo further analyze the function of Tregs and non-Tregs, a cytokine quantification can be performed using ELISAs of the frozen co-culture supernatants from step 23. IL-10 is secreted by Tregs and therefore indicates their function (Maynard et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]), whereas IL-2 represents general T cell activation. Particularly ICOS+ Tregs were reported to mainly sustain their suppressive function through IL-10 secretion (Löhning et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Ito et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) which renders an IL-10 ELISA an important means to investigate the ICOSLG/ICOS-induced Treg expansion.",
    "You can use either timesaving precoated ELISA plates or the cheaper ELISA development kits where plate-coating is performed by the experimenter. Perform ELISAs according to the manufacturer’s protocol of your kit of choice. We performed ELISAs using the IL-2 ELISA Kit (human) (OKBB00179, Aviva)[href=https://www.avivasysbio.com/pub/media/pdf/products/OKBB00179.pdf] and IL-10 (human) ELISA Kit (ADI-900-036, Enzo)[href=https://www.enzolifesciences.com/fileadmin/files/manual/ADI-900-036_insert.pdf] according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\nAlternatives: Instead of using ELISA, ELISpot assays or cytokine bead arrays might also be suitable."
