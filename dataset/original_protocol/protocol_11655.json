    "Ethics statement: Procedures involving human subjects have been approved by the Stichting Beoordeling Ethiek Biomedisch  Onderzoek (Foundation BEBO) and the Leiden University Medical Center.\n1. Integrated Pain Assessment Tasks\nNOTE: The task administration and interface is based on Spike2 software and an analogue-to-digital converter that performs the conversions needed for stimulus triggering and signal recording. This ensures uniform task administration, data capture, handling and storage, and standardizing the delivery of tasks by controlling the stimulus generation equipment while presenting instructions to the subject and feedback on slider position via a second monitor.\nNOTE: Perform the tasks in short succession and in the order presented. The duration of performing all the tasks is approximately 30 min.\nPain scoring\n\tNOTE: For most tasks, stimuli of progressively increasing intensity are presented.\n\t\nPrior to the task, present the subject with an electronic visual analog scale (eVAS) slider.\nInstruct the subject to indicate the intensity of their pain on a scale from 0 (none) to 100 (intolerable pain) by moving the slider from left to right.\nDuring training, and when necessary, provide the subjects with standardized definitions (Table 1) and instructions.\nInform the subject that moving the slider all the way to the left ends the administration of the painful stimulus.\nRecord when stimulus becomes painful (eVAS >0), corresponding to the pain detection threshold. Record when the pain is no longer tolerable to the subject (eVAS = 100), corresponding to the pain tolerance level of the subject and the area under the stimulus-response curve (AUC).\n\t\tNOTE: During training, it is beneficial to provide subjects with a context of pain intensity. Following each task assess the maximal pain intensity using a 100 mm eVAS, with 0 and 100 defined as 'no pain' and 'worst pain imaginable', respectively (Table 1).\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2",

Electrical Stimulation Task\nNOTE: The task has been shown to primarily assess nociception generated from the Aδ and C sensory afferent fibers, which pass nociceptive signals from the periphery to the spinal cord. The Aδ fibers conduct the signal relatively rapidly, causing the sharp localization of pain and the rapid spinal response which is perceived during a transcutaneous electrical stimulus9. The method of electrical stimulation is based on methods described previously15.\nClean an area of skin with skin preparation gel overlying the tibial bone, 100 mm distal from the caudal end of the patella. If required, shave the area beforehand.\nPlace two Ag-AgCl electrodes on the skin. Place the middle of the first electrode (anode) 100 mm distal to the caudal end of the patella. Place the middle of the second electrode (cathode) directly (±135 mm) underneath the first.\nRecord the resistance of the 2 electrodes using an ohmmeter. Ensure it is <2 kΩ. Optionally, remove the electrodes and re-cleanse the skin with skin preparation gel. Instruct the subject to sit comfortably with their foot flat on the floor.",
    "Connect the electrodes to a constant current stimulator and apply a tetanic pulse from 0 mA in steps of 0.5 mA/s (cutoff 50 mA), with a frequency of 10 Hz with a duration of 0.2 ms.\n3. Pressure Stimulation Task\nNOTE: This method of pressure pain induction has been shown to primarily assess nociception generated from the muscle with minimal contribution by cutaneous nociceptors17 and is based on methods described previously16.\nPlace an 11 cm wide tourniquet cuff over the gastrocnemius muscle. Instruct the subject to sit comfortably with their foot flat on the floor. Inflate with a constant pressure rate increase of 0.5 kPa/s up to 100 kPa. Control the pressure with an electro-pneumatic regulator.\n4. Cold Pressor Task\nNOTE: The cold pressor task involves the submersion of an extremity (generally a hand) into cold water. It is used in clinical studies to investigate cardiovascular responses and nociception. It is also a method to induce iCPM (formerly known as diffuse noxious inhibitory control (DNIC)-like effect)18. The method of cold pressor pain is based on the methods previously described8,10.\nPrepare two thermostat-controlled, circulating water baths set at 35.0 ± 0.5 °C and 1.0 ± 0.5 °C.\nPlace a 35 cm tourniquet on the subject's non-dominant upper-arm. During hand immersion, either regulate the blood pressure manually using a sphygmomanometer or by using a custom built electro-pneumatic regulator.\nInstruct the subject to sit comfortably with their palm flat, fingers spread wide without touching the bath and rate their pain intensity using the eVAS.\nInstruct the subject to place their non-dominant hand into a warm water bath for 2 min.\nAt 1 min 45 sec inflate the blood pressure cuff on their upper-arm to 20 mmHg below resting diastolic blood pressure.",
    "At 2 min instruct the subject to move their hand from the warm water bath, directly placing their hand into the cold water bath to similar depth.\nAfter reaching pain tolerance, or after reaching a time limit (120 sec), instruct the subject to remove their arm from the water. At this point deflate the blood pressure cuff and give the subject a towel to dry their forearm.\n5. Conditioned Pain Modulation Paradigm\nNOTE: iCPM is the activation of the pain-modulatory mechanism, as part of the descending endogenous analgesia system18. The degree of iCPM is assessed by comparing the electrical pain thresholds for the single stimulus paradigm before and after the cold pressor task.\nRepeat the electrical stimulation task (section 2) within 5 min after the end of the cold pressor task.\n6. Ultra-violet Inflammation Model\nNOTE: The UVB \"sun burn\" model is a pain model in which erythema is induced on the skin by exposing the skin to UVB light in a well-controlled and reproducible manner. This exposure causes changes to the skin which leads to pain perception being intensified in the affected area (primary hyperalgesia) and is used as biomarker for inflammatory pain. This inflammation model is based on the methods previously described4. Inform subjects that the UVB exposure may leave long-lasting (6 - 12 months) skin marking/tanning and that exposure to UVB in general has been linked to premature skin aging and skin cancer.\nDetermining a Subject's Minimal Erythemic Dose (MED)\n\t\nTurn on the UVB lamp and allow it to warm up for at least 10 min prior to use. Replace the fluorescent tubes once output is <3.0 mW/cm2 (after approximately 50 - 100 working hr).",
    "Instruct the subject to stand with their right hand holding their left shoulder. Place the UVB lamp on the right upper back / shoulder of the subject, in direct contact with the skin. Only induce the erythema on even-toned healthy skin; moles, tattoos, nevus and acne must be avoided.\nApply the UVB exposure at the screening visit in ascending doses (see Table 2) to 6 different 1 x 1 cm areas of skin on the back to determine the individual UVB dose that produces the first clearly discernable erythema (minimal erythemic dose (MED).\nAssess the erythemic response 24 hr (±2 hr) after the exposure of the 6 doses. Determine the MED visually, by means of consensus of two observers with good color vision, by observing which dose produces the first clearly discernable erythema. Choose the 3rd UVB dose to approximate the mean MED for the respective skin type20.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4\nSkin type,I,II,III,IV\nDose,I,II,III,IV\n#1,64,126,176,234\n#2,91,177,248,330\n#3,128,251,351,467\n#4,181,355,496,660\n#5,256,502,702,934\n#6,362,710,993,1321\nTable 2. UVB Dose Regimen Per Skin Type ( mJ/cm2 )\nUVB exposure\n\t\nApply a 3 x 3 cm UVB exposure equivalent to the subject's 3-fold individual MED. Apply this UVB exposure to the subject's back 24 hr prior to the first battery of tasks/dosing. Ensure the UVB exposure produces a homogeneous, well-demarcated area of skin erythema and hyperalgesia.\nAssessment of Skin Thermal Detection Threshold\n\t\nUsing a 3 x 3 cm thermode measure the thermal pain detection threshold on normal skin contralateral to the site of UVB irradiation followed by UVB irradiated skin. Set the temperature initially to 34 °C, then ramp up by 0.5 °C/sec. Record the average pain detection threshold of 3 stimuli.\n7. Subjects",
    "NOTE: In addition to standard selection criteria and to ensure a reasonably homogeneous subject population the following exclusion criteria should be considered. Exclude subjects who meet the following criteria:\nIndicate nociceptive tasks are intolerable at screening.\nAchieve tolerance of >80% of maximum input intensity for cold, pressure and electrical tasks (to exclude pain tolerant individuals which may obfuscate an analgesic effect).\nHave any current, clinically significant, known medical condition, particularly any existing conditions that would affect sensitivity to cold (such as atherosclerosis, Raynaud's disease, urticaria, hypothyroidism) or pain (parasthesia, etc.). Use healthy subjects only.\nUse prescription or nonprescription drugs (especially analgesics) and dietary/herbal supplements within 7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study treatment.\nHave dark skin (Fitzpatrick skin type V or VI), widespread acne, tattoos or scarring on back (due to interference with the UVB model).\nSunbathe or have used sunbeds in the 6 months prior to screening or are unable to not be exposed to excessive sunlight or to sunbathe for the duration of the study. Skin coloration due to sunlight and sunburn affect the UVB study endpoints.\nNOTE: Unless contraindicated, women should be included and where possible menstrual cycle should be either monitored or controlled for (e.g., testing only during luteal phase)."
