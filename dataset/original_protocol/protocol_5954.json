    "Cell cultureMaintain cells using standard cell culture procedures for the cell line of interest. We used mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells (JM8.A) expressing BAC-SRSF3-GFP or NLS-GFP grown on irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder cells. A detailed description of the generation and culture properties of the ES cell lines used here can be found in Ratnadiwakara et al. (2018) and the media composition can be found under Recipes. Transfect the cells with WT-Nanog or ΔSRSF3-Nanog vectors as described in Ratnadiwakara et al. (2018) and 24 h later collect the cells using 0.1% trypsin. WT-Nanog construct carries the wildtype version of Nanog mRNA including the 3’UTR whereas in the ΔSRSF3-Nanog construct synonymous mutations have been introduced within the SRSF3 binding sites. Deplete the MEF feeder cells by seeding the cells on non-gelatine coated plates and incubating for 45 min. This step can be omitted when using feeder-free cell lines.Collect the feeder-free embryonic stem cells in suspension and centrifuge 470 x g for 3 min at 20 °C.Count the cells manually or by using an automated cell counter. We prefer automated counter for consistency and accuracy. Use 5 x 106 cells per immunoprecipitation (see also Note 1).Magnetic bead preparation (Figure 1–step 1)Add 50 μl of Protein G Dynabeads to a fresh microcentrifuge tube corresponding to each of the experimental samples. Wash beads twice each with 900 μl of NET-2 buffer using a magnetic rack.Re-suspend the beads in 100 μl NET-2 buffer with 2-10 μg of antibody of your interest per reaction. We used 10 μg rabbit ChIP grade anti-GFP antibody per 50 μl beads. It is critical to include a negative control in the experiment. Here we used NLS-GFP expressing cells with anti-GFP coupled beads as a negative control.",
    "If an antibody against an endogenous RPB instead of an epitope-tag is used, beads coupled to IgG (antibody isotype control) should be prepared as a negative control reaction.Note: The amount of the antibody needs to be optimized before the first use. The selection of protein G or A beads may depend on the source species of the antibody (Refer to: https://www.neb.com/tools-and-resources/selection-charts/affinity-of-protein-ag-for-igg-types-from-different-species[href=https://www.neb.com/tools-and-resources/selection-charts/affinity-of-protein-ag-for-igg-types-from-different-species]). Rotate the tubes for 60 min at room temperature to allow for antibody coupling to the beads. Note: The cell extract can be prepared during this time. Place the tubes on the magnetic rack and wash two times each with 900 μl NET-2 buffer to remove any unbound antibody and leave the beads in the last wash. Remove the buffer only when ready to proceed to Step D1. Preparation of the cell extract (Figure 1–step 2)Wash the cell pellet by re-suspending it in 1ml of PBS and centrifuging for 3 min at 470 x g at 20 °C.Re-suspend the washed cell pellet in 1 ml of ice-cold NET-2 buffer supplemented with 1x protease inhibitor and 1:1,000 RNaseOUT.Note: From here onwards perform all steps on ice.Sonicate the cells using Bioruptor® for 5 cycles of 20 s on/30 s off at low intensity at 4 °C to disrupt the cell and nuclear membranes and to fragment chromatin.Spin for 10 min at 15,000 x g at 4 °C to remove cell debris.Transfer the supernatant to a fresh microfuge tube.Save 50 μl (5%) of the lysate as input sample and store on ice until the IP is complete. Immunoprecipitation (Figure 1–step 3)Add the remaining lysate to the antibody-coupled beads prepared in Step B5 and rotate at 4 °C for 2 h on a tube rotator to facilitate the binding of the antibody to RBP-RNA complexes (here SRSF3-GFP-RNA and NLS-GFP negative control).",
    "Place the tubes on the magnetic rack and carefully remove and discard the supernatant using a vacuum pump. Note: When performing the IP for the first time, the supernatant can be collected and used for Western blot analysis together with the input and bead eluate to determine how well the antibody depletes the cell extract of the protein of interest, and to confirm the specificity of the antibody. Wash the beads five times by carefully re-suspending in 1 ml of ice-cold NET-2 buffer during each wash. Collect the beads using a magnetic rack between washes. Notes: To improve washing efficiency, the beads can be rotated with the wash buffer for 5 min at 4 °C for the final wash. Leave behind a small amount of the buffer solution during the early washing steps to prevent the loss of beads. Use the recommended amount of the buffer through subsequent washes (10x bead volume or more).  RNA extraction (Figure 1–step 4)Add 500 μl of TRI Reagent to the tubes with beads and inputs.Add 100 μl of chloroform and shake vigorously for 15 s. Allow the tubes to stand for 10 min at room temperature.Centrifuge the mixture at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.Transfer the aqueous layer into a fresh tube and add 250 μl of 2-propanol and 1 μl of Glycogen.Note: Addition of glycogen helps the maximum recovery of the RNA and visualization of the RNA pellet.  Mix carefully and allow to stand at room temperature for 10 min to precipitate the RNA.Collect the precipitated RNA by centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Remove the supernatant and wash the RNA pellet by adding 500 μl of 75 % ethanol, vortex and centrifuge at 7,500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.",
    "Briefly air-dry the RNA pellet for 5-10 min.Note: Avoid over-drying the pellet as this will greatly decrease its solubility.  Re-suspend RNA in 10 μl of RNase-free water and proceed to cDNA Synthesis. Note: Use the complete 10 μl of RNA as a template for cDNA synthesis for each sample allowing the calculation of the enrichment over input (IP/input). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181031/20181031194325_3699.jpgFigure 1. Summary of the workflow of RNA immunoprecipitation in mouse embryonic stem cells using protein G Dynabeads and rabbit anti-GFP antibodyQuantitative PCRPerform DNase I treatment on all samples to remove any genomic DNA contamination that can affect the downstream analysis. We used Promega RQ1 DNase kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Note: Adjust the volumes to total of 13 μl at the end of the DNaseI treatment allowing to proceed directly to cDNA synthesis in a single tube. Carry out the reverse transcription of the input and IP samples using a reverse transcription kit. We used SuperScript III Reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's protocol with 1:1 of random hexamers and oligodT18 for reverse priming. Note: A mixture of random hexamers and oligodT18 can improve the sensitivity of the cDNA synthesis.  Dilute the cDNA 1:10 with nuclease-free water for quantitative PCR. Perform quantitative PCR with primers specific for the gene of interest. Use the optimized manufacturer’s protocol for specific SYBR Green master mixes. We used 5 µl of Luminaries 2x HiGreen qPCR Master Mix per reaction, optimized concentration of each forward and reverse primers (typically 0.15-0.30 µM end concentration) and 2 µl of diluted cDNA per reaction. Perform two or more technical replicates for each sample (see Note 2)."
