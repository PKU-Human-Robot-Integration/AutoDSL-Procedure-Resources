    "The following methods are in accordance with the guidelines of the Sunnybrook Research Institute Animal Care Ethics Committee.\n1. Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy System\nCollect diffuse reflectance spectra using a handheld, fiber-optic probe and portable spectroscopic acquisition system that has been previously described (Kim et al. 2010) and is briefly reviewed in Figure 1 (and related captions) for completeness1,2.\n2. Preparation of Mouse Model of Acute Radiation Skin Damage\nOrder 6-week old mice (preferably hairless, such as athymic or SKH-1) and allow them to acclimate in the animal facility for a week before starting experiments. Reserve at least 3 mice for a non-irradiated control group and 5 mice for an irradiated group.\nBefore baseline DOS measurements and irradiation, label the mice using ear punches or permanent marker markings on the tail. If mice are not nude, remove the hair on a 2 cm by 2 cm patch of flank skin, but this may cause skin irritation.\n3. Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy Data Acquisition\nTurn on the power supply to the electronics.\nFor mouse skin, set the signal parameters for the acquisition software by typing in 25 msec for collection time, 25 for signal averages and 1 for boxcar filter width. These parameters offer a reasonable balance between acquisition time and signal to noise.\nUsing custom programmed acquisition software, automatically acquire a background reading, Rbg (LED off) and diffuse reflectance at two source-detector separation distances, Rmeas (260 μm, 520 μm) by clicking the \"Acquire\" button. The total acquisition time is ~ 2 sec.\nSwitch off all fluorescent room lights by pressing on the room light switch before performing measurements.",
    "NOTE: Fluorescent room light interfere with the detected signal (these lights produce a time-varying light intensity and thus it is difficult to subtract as a background signal). Although incandescent bulbs may be employed keep the lights at a distance from the DOS probe to avoid high background levels (and poor signal to noise).\n4. Animal Anesthesia and Baseline DOS Measurements\nPrepare the anesthesia machine by ensuring that all connections are intact and liquid isoflurane level is adequate. Use an anesthesia induction chamber with an attached tube and nose cone that can be taped down to a sterilized, softly padded surface within comfortable reach of the DOS probe.\nAnaesthetize one cage of mice at a time in the induction chamber by inducing with 4% isoflurane for 30 sec. Lower the isoflurane amount to 2% for the next 2 min. Verify that the mouse is anaesthetized by observing no response from pinching a toe of the hind limb.\nQuickly move one mouse onto the sterilized DOS probing area, place it on its side, fasten its snout into the nose cone and open the nose cone tubing to the flow of anesthesia (2% isoflurane).\n\tNOTE: If the procedure takes longer than 1 - 2 min, apply vet ointment on the eyes to prevent dryness.\nBefore acquiring mouse skin measurements, sterilize the probe by wiping with 70% ethanol. Do not sterilize the skin.\nPlace the probe gently on the flank skin making sure to avoid dispersing the local vasculature. Hold the probe by hand for the duration of the measurement.",
    "Acquire reflectance data by probing a flank skin area of about 2 cm by 2 cm (the area to be irradiated) by following the 5-dot formation on a die. Keep this probing pattern, area, probe pressure and body side (left or right) consistent for all subsequent measurements.\n\tNOTE: The complete scan takes approximately 60 sec. Probe pressure should be just enough to obtain a scan without dispersing local vasculature.\nMove the mouse into a recovery cage, and move the next mouse over to the DOS probing area. Repeat steps 4.2 - 4.6 until all mice have been measured. Do not leave an animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\n5. Animal irradiation\nNOTE: This protocol requires the use of an irradiator, and animal preparation may need to be adjusted to meet the needs of the irradiator device. During irradiation, only the small area of flank skin should be exposed to the radiation beam. The irradiator should be located in a sterile facility and appropriate cage sterilization should be observed when returning mice to their sterile housing area.\nPrepare the anesthesia machine (as in steps 4.1 - 4.2) and anaesthetize one mouse at a time in the induction chamber before preparing it for irradiation.\nRemove the mouse from the induction chamber, gently pinch the flank skin and place tape over and below the stretched skin, forming a flap.\nPlace the mouse onto a plexiglass stage and cover the body with a custom lead jig (a working design is a rectangular box with the bottom and at least one end open, along with a side window to allow flank skin to be pulled through). Pull the skin flap through the jig window and gently tape the flap onto the stage.",
    "NOTE: The custom lead jig is small enough to immobilize the mouse. If the custom jig does not completely immobilize the mouse, then use additional restrainers and/or administer ketamine (80 - 100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 - 12.5 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection to keep the mouse immobilized throughout the entire irradiation procedure.\nPlace the plexiglass stage with the jig and mouse into the irradiator. Determine the settings (skin distance from x-ray source, voltage, duration and amperage) and deliver the desired dose (e.g., 11 cm from a 160 kVp x-ray source for 2.5 min with 6.3 mA).\n\tNOTE: Use CAUTION with the x-ray source by following machine use guidelines to avoid burns and DNA damage.\n\tNOTE: Athymic nude mice develop moist desquamation around 14 days post irradiation in response to 35 Gy, but only minor patchy desquamation with 17 Gy.\nTake the apparatus and mouse out of the irradiator, remove the shielding, remove the tape and place it into an individual recovery cage. Return the mouse to its normal shared cage after it has recovered from the anesthesia. Repeat steps 5.2 - 5.4 for all mice, and perform a sham operation on control mice.\nAfter irradiation, house the animals in their regular conditions. If abnormal behavior develops (e.g., hunched posture, which may signify pain), consult a veterinarian to diagnose the problem. Pain alleviation may include administering 0.1 mg/kg buprenorphine subcutaneously or as directed by the veterinarian. If weight loss exceeds 20% of normal body mass, house it separately in its own cage and provide high-nutrient food.\n6. Follow-up DOS Measurements",
    "Monitor and measure skin reaction intensity using the quantitative DOS technique. Visual inspection of skin changes and previous work suggest that large changes in DOS parameters can be expected (relative to baseline) around 6 - 12 days following irradiation3,4. However, since appreciable changes may take place even earlier or later depending on the model, other measurement time points may be useful to investigate.\nSet up DOS equipment and calibrations as described in section 3.Prepare the anesthesia machine and acquire DOS measurements as described in section 4.\n7. Post-acquisition Processing\nNOTE: All steps in the following section are performed using a custom program created in a high performance software environment. Standardized naming conventions for each spectral acquisition file are employed to allow for batch processing. All steps are illustrated in Figure 2.\nSubtract the baseline (noise floor) from all the measured spectra including the background reading.\nSubtract the background reading, Rbg (LED off), obtained in Step 3.3 from the measurement spectrum, Rmeas.\n\tNOTE: For the remainder of this article all spectra are assumed to be noise floor and background subtracted and referred to as Rcorr.\nConvert Rcorr to absolute reflectance, Rabs, as described in references 1,2 in Section 1.\n\t\nObtain relative reflectance measurements, Rrel, in Intralipid-20% phantoms (Fresenius Kabi, Sweden) phantoms with increasing 3% aliquot fractions up to 48% (i.e., 3%,6%,9%, ..., 48%) and create of plot of Rrel versus Intralipid concentration.\nGenerate an absolute plot of Rabs versus μs' using the diffusion equation for reflectance.14\nMatch the peak of both curves and adjust the Rrel x-axis to match the Rabs x-axis.\nAt a given wavelength and source-detector separation, scale the y-axis using:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53573/53573eq2.jpg\n\t\tNOTE: In the following section, all fitting of measurements will refer to Rabs.\n8. Spectral Data Fitting",
    "NOTE: The following section outlines the theory and fitting algorithm utilized for extracting functional parameters of mice skin. For all theory employed, refer to the following articles14-18 and references therein. All equations are assumed to be programmed in a high end scientific software environment (containing pre-programmed modules) commonly used in physics or engineering labs.\nProgram a function that describes the absorption spectrum, μa(λ) of skin as the sum of relevant individual chromophores in the spectral range of interest using the equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53573/53573eq4.jpg\n\tHere, Hb is the total hemoglobin concentration (g/L) , while StO2 is the unitless oxygen saturation ranging from 0 to 1.\nObtain oxy, imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53573/53573eq5.jpg, and deoxy, imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53573/53573eq6.jpg, hemoglobin spectra (stored as text files) from the on-line collection of Prahl19.\nProgram a function that describes the scattering spectrum of skin, imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53573/53573eq7.jpg, using a power law dependence, where A (cm-1) is the value of μs' at λo = 1 nm and k is a medium dependent power factor16.\nProgram a mathematical function for the forward model of diffuse reflectance based on equations from reference 14 that incorporate the spectral equations from Steps 8.2 - 8.3 into the forward model function (i.e., R(r, μa(λ), μs'(λ)) = R(r, Hb, StO2, A, k).\n\tNOTE: While various models exist, the steady-state diffusion theory equation provides a simple and accurate description of the light distribution in tissue.\nProgram a function that squares the difference between the forward modeled reflectance spectra from Section 8.4 and the measured reflectance spectra.\nIteratively change Hb, StO2, A, and k until the least squares difference function in Section 8.5 is smallest. MatLab's lsqcurvefit can be used to automatically perform this step.\nRepeat steps 8.5 - 8.6 to obtain DOS parameters (Hb, StO2, A, and k) for all measured reflectance data sets.",
    "Plot the relative change in DOS parameter with the corresponding unique baseline measurement using the average of each mouse's set of 3 - 5 normalized probe spot measurements. These plots are created using MatLab's plot command.\n9. Visual Radiation Dermatitis Scoring Period\nMonitor and score skin reaction intensity using a qualitative grading scale (see Douglas and Fowler grading scale20) after irradiation every 48 hr (one may also observe changes 3 - 24 hr following irradiation). Two blinded investigators are ideal. Acquiring photographs with a hand-held camera and reference scale (i.e., ruler) may help with evaluations. \nNOTE: Scoring the skin every two days after irradiation may help determine optimal DOS measurement times for the model. More frequent scoring may yield important data depending on the model and research question.\nPlot the median of each group at each time point. Compare groups at specific time points or the median overall areas under each curve.\nAfter mice have been followed to the point of skin healing that is desired (e.g., 4 weeks), euthanize the mice by an appropriate (approved) method."
