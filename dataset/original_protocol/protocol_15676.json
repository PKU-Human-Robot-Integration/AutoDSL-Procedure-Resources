    "The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Université de Montréal (#22053, #22054) approved all animal procedures. See Table 1 for a list of solutions and their composition and the Table of Materials for a list of materials, equipment, and reagents used in this protocol.\n1. NK cell isolation, culture, and stimulation\nGenerate nociceptor neuron intact (littermate control; TRPV1wt::DTAfl/wt) and ablated (TRPV1cre::DTAfl/wt) mice by crossing lox-stop-lox-diphtheria toxin mice (DTAfl/fl) with TRPV1cre/wt mice.\nUsing CO2 inhalation, euthanize a naïve littermate control (TRPV1wt::DTAfl/wt) mouse.\nCollect the spleen in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing 500 µL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nHomogenize the spleen using a pestle.\nDilute the cells with 1 mL of sterile PBS.\nFilter the mixture through a 50 µm cell strainer into a 15 mL conical tube.\nTop up the volume (10 mL) with sterile PBS.\nCollect 10 µL and count the cells using a hemocytometer.\nCentrifuge the cells (500 × g, 5 min) and remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells at a concentration of 108 cells/mL in supplemented RPMI 1640 medium.\nFollow the manufacturer's instructions to magnetically purify spleen NK cells using a mouse NK cell isolation kit. Confirm NK cell purity using flow cytometry11.\nCollect 10 µL and count the cells using a hemocytometer.\nCentrifuge the cells (500 × g, 5 min) and remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the NK cells in supplemented RPMI 1640 culture medium (containing IL-2 and IL-15).\nCulture 2 × 106 NK cells/mL in a 96-well U-bottom plate for 48 h.\n2. DRG neuron isolation and culture\nAt 24 h prior to the end of the NK cell stimulation (step 1.15), coat a 96-well plate with 100 µL/well of laminin (1 ng/mL) and incubate for 45 min (37 °C).",
    "After incubation, remove the solution and allow the wells to air-dry in a biosafety cabinet.\nUsing CO2 inhalation, euthanize nociceptor neuron intact (littermate control; TRPV1wt::DTAfl/wt) or ablated (TRPV1cre::DTAfl/wt) mice.\n\tNOTE: CO2 inhalation is preferred to cervical dislocation as it avoids disrupting the spinal nerves connected to the DRG.\nSecure the mouse on the board in a prone position, lift the skin, and incise the skin along the dorsal column. Refer to Perner et al. for a detailed video12.\nCut off the lumbosacral joint and separate the sacrum from the lumbar spine with scissors.\nSeparate the spine by cutting the muscles and ribs on both sides of the spine in the cranial direction until the base of the skull is reached.\nUsing scissors, cut off the spine at the atlanto-occipital joint.\nRemove muscle and fatty tissue from the spine.\nPin and open the vertebral column to remove the spinal cord and gain access to the DRG. Look for the DRG in the intervertebral foramina connected to the spinal cord through the dorsal root but separated from the meninges.\nHarvest the DRGs into a 15 mL conical tube filled with 10 mL of ice-cold supplemented DMEM.\nCentrifuge the preparation (200 × g, 5 min, room temperature) and remove the supernatant.\nAdd 250 µL of PBS containing Collagenase IV (1 mg/mL) and Dispase II (2.4 U/mL).\nIncubate the DRG with Collagenase IV/Dispase II (C/D) solution (80 min, 37 °C, mild agitation). When pooling ganglia from several mice, maintain a ratio of 125 µL of C/D solution per ganglion.\nTo inactivate the enzymes, add 5 mL of supplemented DMEM medium.\nCentrifuge the solution (200 × g, 5 min) and gently remove the supernatant using a pipette.\nTo avoid unwanted cell loss, leave ~100 µL of the supernatant.\nAdd 1 mL of supplemented DMEM medium.",
    "Using a pipette gun and three glass Pasteur pipettes of decreasing sizes, gently triturate (~10 up/down per Pasteur pipette size) the DRG into a single-cell preparation.\nIn a biosafety cabinet, dilute bovine serum albumin (BSA) in sterile PBS to a final concentration of 15%. Store 1 mL aliquots at −20 °C.\nCreate a BSA gradient in a 15 mL conical tube by adding 2 mL of sterile PBS and slowly dispensing 1 mL of 15% BSA solution at the bottom of the tube. Avoid disrupting the gradient by gently removing the pipette.\nUsing a P200 pipette, slowly pipette the triturated ganglia suspension (which contains the neurons) onto the side of the tube into the gradient.\nCentrifuge the neuron-containing BSA gradient (200 × g, 12 min, room temperature). Set the acceleration and deceleration of the centrifuge to the minimum speed.\n\tNOTE: After centrifugation, the neurons will be at the bottom of the tube while the cell debris will be trapped in the BSA gradient.\nGently remove all of the supernatant using a pipette.\nResuspend the cells in 500 µL of Neurobasal.\nPlate 104 neurons per well (200 µL of neurobasal/well) in a laminin-coated, flat-bottom 96-well plate.\n\tNOTE: On average, an investigator will be able to fill ~8 wells per mouse.\nCulture the neurons (37 °C, overnight) to allow attachment.\n3. Co-culture and flow cytometry\nSlowly remove the neurobasal from the neuron culture.\nAfter 48 h stimulation with IL-2 and IL-15 (see steps 1.14-1.15), resuspend the NK cells and add 105 NK cells/well to the neuron culture (96-well flat bottom plate).\n\tNOTE: On average, the investigator will be able to fill ~6 wells per mouse.\nCo-culture the cells in supplemented neurobasal MX (37 °C, 48 h).\nCollect the cells, wash with PBS (3x), and centrifuge (500 × g, 5 min, 4 °C).",
    "Discard the supernatant and stain the cells with Viability Dye eFlour-780 (1:1,000, 15 min, 4 °C).\nCollect the cells, wash with PBS (3x), and centrifuge (500 × g, 5 min, 4 °C).\nBlock nonspecific sites on the cells with CD16/32 (1:100, 15 min, 4 °C).\nCollect the cells, wash with PBS (3x), and centrifuge (500 × g, 5 min, 4 °C).\nStain (15 min, 4 °C) the cells with BV421 anti-NK-1.1 (1:100), fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) anti-NKp46 (1:100), and phycoerythrin (PE) anti-GM-CSF (1:100).\nCollect the cells, wash with PBS (3x), and centrifuge (500 × g, 5 min, 4 °C).\nDiscard the supernatant, resuspend the cells in FACS buffer (500 µL) and immunophenotype the NK cells by flow cytometry11.
