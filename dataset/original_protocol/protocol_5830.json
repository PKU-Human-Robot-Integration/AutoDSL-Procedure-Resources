    "Note: All experiments are conducted according to the guidelines of the Ethics committee, Medical University of Vienna approved by the Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Culture, Austria. Code number: BMWFW-66.009/0206-WF/V/3b/2015. HousingRats were housed individually in standard Makrolon cages (type 4, 59 cm x 38 cm and 20 cm in height), the grounds of which were covered with commercial bedding material (autoclaved wood chips). Standard food (ssniff, R/M-H, Soest, Germany) and tap water were given ad libitum until the beginning of handling. The animals were adapted to the testing room place, with the same conditions as in the colony room (22 ± 2 °C; humidity: 55 ± 5%; 12 h artificial light/12 h dark cycle: light on at 7 AM). Rats were adapted to the experimental rooms for at least 24 h before starting the experiment and remained in the experimental room, throughout the entire duration of the experiment.Animal handlingAll experimental procedures start at 9 AM in the light phase (overview in Figure 2).Pick the rats up by the body (not the tail), and let them set on the experimenter's arm. If the rat becomes agitated, then it should be released and returned to its home cage. Handling is essential to reduce stress effects during experiments, which can severely affect the behavioral outcome of the tests. Handle each rat for 15 min each day for three consecutive days before habituation. Record the body weight of the animals from the first day of handling throughout the experiment. The animals are mildly food deprived (6 g of standard food per rat/day) during this period to decrease the body weight to 85% of initial free feeding and maintain this throughout the experiment while tap water is given ad libitum.",
    "Give 15 reward food pellets in the home cage during the handling days prior to training in order to familiarize the rat with the pellets.The experimenter stays in the room behind a wall barrier observing the rats on the computer screen connected with the video camera.HabituationHabituate the rats to the T-maze on days 4 and 5. During habituation the rats are allowed to freely explore the maze for 15 min. Food reward pellets are available during habituation. At day 4, scatter 20 pellets over the maze in a short distance to each other in order to let the animals learn that food is available in the maze and to motivate the rat to move forward. At day 5, pellets are located only in the cups at the end of the two-goal arms.TrainingDay 6 is the first day of training. Place the animals in the box of the starting arm and release after 10 sec (Figure 3A).During the forced trial, place a reward pellet at the end of one randomly selected open arm, block the opposite arm with the guillotine door (Figure 3B).In the following trial, open both arms but only bait the opposite arm of that arm baited during the forced trial (Figure 3C).After completion of each trial (Figures 3D-3E) pick up the rats and transfer them to their home cage until the next trial starts (intertrial interval of 5 min).Place a food reward pellet in the food cup of the arm not previously rewarded.Record arm entries when the entire animal (including the tail tip) has moved into one arm.After selection of the unbaited arm, apply a self-correction procedure by keeping the baited arm baited until it is visited, allowing the rat to shift their choice. The food reward remains in its location until it is found and eaten.",
    "Ten trials (including the forced trial) are performed.At days 7 and 8, repeat Steps D1 to D7 (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180717/20180717183033_7835.jpgFigure 2.

Example of a training sequence starting with the forced trial (A-C) followed by a training trial (D-F). A. The rat is waiting for 10 sec in the starting chamber; B. Forced trail; C. The rat is eating the pellet; D-F. The rat in the second trial should always choose the opposite arm of its previous visit, otherwise a memory error is recorded.Notes: The T-maze is cleaned with 1% Incidin between trials to remove any olfactory cues.It is very useful to measure the time the animal needs to leave the start box until entering an arm (latency) in order to control for possible sensory or motoric side effects of treatment.If the rat enters the unbaited arm, record a working memory error and place the rat back at the start position without a food reward. Record the number of correct entries into baited arms, number of reentries into unbaited arms (Video 1).Indirect illumination provides similar light intensities in the three arms (40-50 lux). Higher illumination differences between arms cause a bias of the rat responses to the darker arm since rats prefer dark areas for safety reasons.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1.
