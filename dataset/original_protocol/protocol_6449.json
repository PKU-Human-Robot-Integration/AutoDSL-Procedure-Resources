    "Induction of ovalbumin (OVA)-induced AADPrepare a stock solution of OVA at 2 mg/ml in PBS (Recipe 1).Thaw a vial of OVA stock solution and prepare OVA/Alum cocktail (100 µl of cocktail needed per mouse). This mixture contains 10 µg of OVA and 4 mg of Alum per 100 µl inoculum.OVA/Alum cocktail:70% 1x PBS25% Aluminum hydroxide 5% OVA (2 mg/ml)Transfer OVA/Alum cocktail into a 1 ml syringe and intraperitoneally (i.p.) inject 100 µl into each mouse on days -18 and -11 (see Figure 1 and Table 1). A fresh OVA/Alum cocktail should be made for each day.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200413/20200413004050_3827.jpgFigure 1. The ovalbumin (OVA)-induced AAD-influenza H1N1 virus–S. pneumoniae triple challenge model. The schematic diagram of OVA-induced AAD and influenza–S. pneumoniae co-infection in mice. The triple challenge model consists of treating mice intraperitoneally (i.p.) with OVA in Aluminum hydroxide (OVA/Alum) and challenging them intranasally (i.n.) with OVA followed by infection with influenza virus, Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), and/or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).Table 1. Experimental layoutimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200413/20200413005246_5767.jpgOn day -4, thaw a vial of OVA stock solution (2 mg/ml in PBS).Place the anesthesia chamber in the biosafety cabinet and “pre-charge” the anesthesia chamber with 3% isoflurane by following the manufacturer’s instructions.Place mice into the anesthesia chamber; mice are ready once their breathing has slowed. This usually occurs after 1-2 min in the chamber.Pick up an anesthetized mouse with one hand by grabbing the dorsal skin and positioning the mouse upright and facing you–please see Video 1 in Tibbitt and Coquet (2016).With the other hand, pipette 50 µl (100 µg) of the OVA stock into the nostril. Continue to hold the mouse upright for a few seconds to allow the inoculum to be completely taken up; heavy breathing indicates that the inoculum has reached the lungs.Repeat the intranasal (i.n.) OVA inoculation for 5 consecutive days.",
    "Excess OVA can be stored at -20 °C but discarded after 2-3 freeze-thaw cycles. Successful induction of AAD in mice can be confirmed by measuring allergic airway associated cytokines (interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-13), OVA-specific anti-IgE antibody concentrations by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), cellular infiltration into the lung by flow cytometry, lung damage/inflammation by histology, and/or airway responsiveness to methacholine (as described in Roberts et al., 2019), our original paper.Alternative approach: House-dust mite (HDM)-induced AADWe have used HDM as an alternative allergen to OVA and observed comparable results (Roberts et al., 2019). Mice are intranasally challenged with HDM for three consecutive days per week for three weeks before the influenza virus and subsequent bacterial infection (Figure 2):imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200413/20200413004318_9532.jpgFigure 2. House-dust mite (HDM)-induced AAD and influenza-S. pneumoniae coinfection. Schematic diagram of HDM-induced AAD and subsequent influenza–S. pneumoniae coinfection.Prepare a stock solution of HDM at 1 mg/ml in PBS (Recipe 2).On day -16, thaw a vial of stock solution of HDM (1 mg/ml in PBS).Place the anesthesia chamber in the biosafety cabinet and “pre-charge” the anesthesia chamber with isoflurane by following the manufacturer’s instructions.Pipette 50 µl (100 µg) of the HDM solution into the nostril of each mouse. Continue to hold mouse upright for a few seconds to allow the inoculum to be completely taken up. Excess HDM can be stored at -20 ℃ but discarded after 2-3 freeze-thaw cycles.Repeat HDM inoculation on subsequent days as outlined above.Influenza H1N1 virus and S. pneumoniae coinfection of AAD miceNote: We produced a lab stock of influenza H1N1 A/California/4/2009 (CA04) and A/PR8/34 (PR8) in chicken eggs. See protocol for growing viruses (Cottey et al., 2001; Zhao et al., 2018) or purchase from vendors.",
    "Influenza H1N1 virus challenge On day 7 following the last OVA or HDM treatment, working in an ABSL-2 cabinet, dilute the influenza H1N1 virus stock to 200 plaque-forming units (PFU) per ml in sterile 1x PBS (Final dose: 10 PFU in 50 µl inoculum per mouse) and store on ice.Place the anesthesia chamber into the biosafety cabinet and pre-charge the anesthesia chamber with isoflurane by following the manufacturer’s instructions.Pipette 50 µl of the diluted influenza virus into the nostril of each mouse. Continue to hold the mouse upright for a few seconds to allow the inoculum to be completely taken up.Weigh mice individually or as a group either before or after influenza infection.Weigh daily until mice start to recover their weight.Note: Sub-lethally infected mice will start losing weight around day 3 and will begin to recover on days 6-9. On average, mice typically lose about 10% of their starting weight with a low-dose influenza challenge. Secondary S. pneumoniae challenge On day 8 after influenza virus infection, in an ABSL-2 cabinet, thaw a vial of frozen S. pneumoniae stock (Recipe 3) and serially dilute it in 1.5 ml conical tubes to a sublethal dose in sterile 1x PBS and store on ice.For our stock of S. pneumoniae type 3 A66.1 strain, 100-500 colony forming units (CFU) is a sublethal dose for non-influenza-infected mice and is 90-100% lethal for influenza-infected mice.For our stock of serotype 2 D39 strain, 1 x 105 CFU is lethal for influenza-infected mice but sublethal for non-influenza-infected mice.",
    "To quantify the initial bacterial input, pipette 100 µl of the bacteria from the serially diluted tubes onto blood agar plates (aiming for 100-300 CFU per plate) and store in a 37 °C incubator overnight–count the number of CFU on the plates the following day to determine the actual infectious dose.Anesthetize mice using isoflurane, as described above.Infect mice with bacteria by pipetting 50 µl into the nostril.Monitor mice for survival or sacrifice and harvest bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and/or lungs to analyze cellularity, cytokine production, and/or histology for lung architecture.Note: Non-AAD influenza–S. pneumoniae-infected mice will succumb to infection day 1-3 after bacterial challenge. We typically monitor survival or harvest bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and/or lung tissue for analysis on day 16 (day 1 post S. pneumoniae infection) to assess bacterial burden, cytokine expression, lung damage, and/or cell infiltration (as described in Roberts et al., 2019, our original paper)."
