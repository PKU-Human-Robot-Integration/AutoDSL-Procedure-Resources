    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nYeast Engineering\nTiming: 7–11 days\nThis protocol describes how to recombine large fragments of phage genomic DNA in yeast and how to extract and validate the genomic DNA containing the YAC- λ construct. Steps include yeast culture, genome assembly by transformation of phage DNA into competent yeast cells, genomic DNA extraction, and transformant validation by PCR. Depending on the desired modifications to the phage genome, simpler phage engineering protocols could be substituted such as recombineering in bacteria instead of yeast (see Thomason et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). We chose the yeast recombineering method as it is easier to multiplex multiple modifications to the phage genome simultaneously, does not need a separate selection marker per modification generated and requires screening fewer colonies.\nPick single colonies of S. cerevisiae BY4741 and inoculate in 3 mL YPD broth a day prior to yeast recombination protocol and grow at 30°C for 16 h.\nDilute the overnight (grown for 16 h) cultures 1:10 into 30 mL of YPD broth and incubate at 30°C for 4 h.\nCentrifuge cells at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 24°C.\nWash with 25 mL water, and centrifuge as step 3.\nWash with 1 mL of 100 mM lithium acetate (LiAc), and centrifuge as step 3.\nPerform the final resuspension in 240 μL of 100 mM LiAc.\nCritical: After resuspension in LiAc, competent cells are promptly used for transformation and not stored.\nMix all PCR products (phage genome fragments and YAC) in an eppendorf tube up to a total volume of 50 μL, including H2O.\nAdd approximately 1 μg of DNA per fragment and 300 ng of YAC.\nNote: The DNA should be concentrated during the PCR purification step to reach ∼1,000 ng/μL so that only 1 μL of each fragment is added.",
    "In addition, add approximately 1 μg of pRS415 plasmid DNA to 50 μL of water as a positive control and 300ng of the YAC vector to 50 μL of water as a negative transformation control.\nNote: The original yeast recombineering protocol (Ando et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), recommends 400 ng DNA/fragment; however, we have found the protocol to be more robust with 1 μg of DNA/fragment and at least 3× molar excess for fragments less than 1 kb.\nBoil 2 mg/mL salmon sperm DNA (Invitrogen) at 95°C for 5 min.\nMake three transformation mixtures, each with 50 μL yeast competent cells, 240 μL 50% PEG3350 (Sigma-Aldrich), 36 μL 1 M LiAc and 25 μL boiled salmon sperm DNA.\nCombine each of the DNA mixtures (reaction mixture, negative and positive controls) with a transformation mixture.\nVortex the mixture gently at medium speed.\nIncubate at 30°C for 30 min in a rotating nutator.\nIncubate the mixture at 42°C for 45 min.\nCentrifuge at 8,000 × g for 30 s and resuspend in 200 μL water.\nPlate the transformants on SD-LEU plates and incubate at 30°C for 3–5 days.\nAfter colonies are visible, transformants can be screened for proper assembly. The positive control transformed with prs415 should have close to a lawn of colonies after plating the whole transformation volume. If the transformation efficiency is low, see Troubleshooting: Problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nPick 8 colonies and resuspend each in 30 μL of H2O.\nMix 20 μL of colony suspensions with 100 μL of freshly made 20 mM NaOH and incubate at 95°C for 10 min.\nNote: This step can be reduced to 5 min of incubation.\nCritical: Save the remainder of the colony suspension for liquid growth.\nVortex and centrifuge at 8,000 × g for 1 min.",
    "Use 1 μL of lysate as a template in a colony PCR reaction with each of the junction check primers using GoTaq Green Mastermix (Promega). See Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] for primer sets, Table 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6] for reaction mixture and Table 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl7] for thermocycler setup (see Figures S1A and S1B of Bodner et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] for example junction PCR design and gel electrophoresis)\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_127_10.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_127_11.csv\nNote: Validate the two outside junctions between the phage and the YAC and all of the new junctions introduced before proceeding to check all junctions.\nFor colonies containing all correct junctions, inoculate 10 μL of suspension in 20 mL of SD-LEU liquid medium and grow cultures at 30°C for 3–5 days (or until OD600=1.0 is reached).\nPause Point: Yeast cultures containing YAC- λ constructs can be glycerol stocked (15% glycerol) and stored at −80°C.\nExtract total yeast genomic DNA (gDNA) from a volume of cells containing OD600=10 equivalent from the liquid cultures using the YeaStarTM Genomic DNA Kit (Zymo Research) using protocol I.\nTypical yields range from 30–70 ng/μL when eluted in 30 μL volume.\nCritical: Perform PCR reactions for all junctions once more with the junction primer sets to confirm unwanted recombination did not occur during growth.\nPause Point: Yeast genomic DNA can be stored for several weeks at 4°C prior to bacterial electroporation.\nRecombinant Phage Particle Formation\nTiming: 7 days",
    "These steps describe how to generate or reboot phage particles from phage genomic DNA extracted from yeast. After the YAC- λ genome is electroporated into E. coli, the phage will excise, replicate, and form viral particles. The λ genome should excise from the YAC just as it would from the E. coli genome and viral particles will go on to infect untransformed cells, integrate, and form lysogens, which can be selected for with an antibiotic resistance gene on the phage. A plaque assay to detect spontaneous generated phage particles from the lysogen is then performed by mixing lysogens with a susceptible non-lysogen strain to generate plaques. Ultimately, plaques are propagated to form a high titer stock of liquid recombinant phage particles.\nMix 2.5 μL validated yeast gDNA with 25 μL of E. coli MegaX DH10B T1R Electrocomp Cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on ice. Add 25 μL of transformation mixture in a 1-mm gap electroporation cuvette (Fisher) and electroporate at 2,000 V, 25 μF, and 200 Ω.\nNote: Chill cuvette, eppendorf tubes and pipette tips on ice prior to electroporation.\nAlternatives: DH10B cells were chosen as a highly electrocompetent, λ negative and T1 phage resistant strain, along with genetic recombination deficiencies. Other electrocompetent strains that have efficiency close to 1010 cfu (colony forming units)/μg of pUC19 DNA may be used, but homemade electrocompetent strains likely do not have efficiency high enough for this protocol. For engineering other phages besides λ, this competent cell line must be able to be lysogenized by the phage of interest. A high efficiency protocol for generating electrocompetent cells for other bacterial cell lines of interest is necessary.\nMix cells with 1 mL of Recovery Medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and recover at 37°C for 3 h.",
    "Alternatives: This recovery medium may be replaced with a standard transformation rich recovery medium such as SOC or a media specific to another bacterial line protocol.\nPlate onto LB agar plates supplemented with 20 μg/mL kanamycin, and incubate for 16 h at 37°C.\nNote: If working with a temperature sensitive mutant of cI such as cI857, then this step should be performed at 30°C.\nNote: Formation of kanamycin resistant lysogens suggests that the phage was able to excise from the YAC-phage construct, form particles and infect and lysogenize untransformed E. coli.\nNote: Plates may have only several colonies of lysogens. The phage-YAC construct makes up 0.4% of the total yeast genomic DNA transformed into E. coli.\nPick several colonies per lysogen, resuspend in 20μL H2O, and use 1 μL as template in a colony PCR reaction with primers across the attR site to validate that the attR site formed as a result of phage integration. Use primers KB302, KB303 and follow the reaction mixture in Table 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6] and thermocycler settings in Table 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl7].\nNote: This colony PCR protocol assumes that the strain of bacteria can be denatured in the first 95°C step.\nPerform another PCR to validate the lysogens formed with the recombinant phage particles rather than contaminating WT phage. Perform a Phusion PCR reaction using the insert 6 primers (KB48, KB51) across the mKate cassette and purify with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, according to the standard protocol, with the following modifications:\nFor optimal yield, elute DNA in a small volume, 15 μL, and incubate the product for 1 in at RT prior to centrifugation.\nSend off PCR product directly for sequencing to confirm there was no cross-contamination with WT λ to form the lysogens.",
    "Isolate recombinant λ mKate phage particles produced by the DH10B lysogens by detecting spontaneous induction in a plaque assay when mixed with a susceptible indicator strain. First, generate plating cells to be used as a susceptible indicator strain. Grow phage-susceptible MG1655/pUC19 E. coli for 16 h in 3 mL of LB supplemented with carbenicillin at 37°C.\nNote: The pUC19 provides carbenicillin resistance for the spontaneous induction assay where the donor phage strain has no antibiotic resistance. When the donor strain and the plating cells are mixed in the plaque assay, the released phages should infect the plating cells and form plaques. The donor bacterial strain will be killed by the carbenicillin on the plates. The choice of pUC19 was arbitrary. Any plasmid that has no effect on phage life cycle and has a single antibiotic resistance gene can be used in this step along with the corresponding antibiotic plates.\nThe next morning, dilute E. coli plating cells 100-fold into 20 mL TB + 0.2% maltose (EMD Chemicals) and culture at 37°C until OD600=0.4 (roughly 2 h).\nIncubate cells on ice for 15 min.\nCentrifuge cells at 3,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nResuspend in cold TB + 10 mM MgSO4 (Sigma-Aldrich) to a final OD600=2.0.\nPause Point: Plating cells remain viable for use when stored at 4°C for up to 1 week.\nGrow the lysogens from step 26 for 16 h in 3 mL LB + kanamycin. Dilute 1:100 in LB + 10mM MgSO4 + 0.2% glucose and grow at 37°C until mid-exponential phase.\nNote: If working with a temperature sensitive mutant of cI such as cI857, then this step should be performed at 30°C. Furthermore, a 15 min heat shock should be performed prior to step 33 at 42°C.",
    "Note: The glucose is added to the growth medium to repress expression of the phage receptor, LamB. This prevents uninduced bacteria from taking up released phage particles.\nMix 100 μL of plating cells and 100 μL of lysogen culture along with 3 mL of TB soft (0.7%) agar and plate onto TB Carb plates and incubate for 16 h at 37°C.\nNote: Include a plating cell only control to control for contamination.\nNote: The Carb allows a lawn of only the plating cells to grow, and any spontaneously produced particles should propagate as plaques.\nPick several “cloudy” plaques and store in 100 μL of SM+gelatin buffer at 4°C. If there are no obvious plaques, see Troubleshooting: Problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]. See Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9] for an example of cloudy plaque morphology.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/127-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. Example Plaques from λ-mKate\nAn example TB agar plate from a titering protocol of a lawn of MG1655 E. coli mixed with a 104 dilution of λ-mKate. Arrows indicate examples of cloudy plaques.\nNote: Make sure to pick the plaque by carefully skimming the “top agar”.\nNote: Cloudy plaques are those that have a region of growth in the center of the plaque with a zone of clearance around the center. This indicates the formation of lysogens within the plaque. If the plaque is totally clear with no growth center, this could indicate a purely lytic mutant phage.\nOnce more, validate the phage for the presence of the mKate by PCR.\nPause Point: Plaques can be stored at 4°C in the dark until ready for step 36.\nPropagate the plaque to increase phage titer by performing a plate lysis protocol. First, grow a propagation host (MG1655/pUC19) for 16 h overnight in LB.",
    "The following morning, prepare propagation plates for phage. Mix 1.2% Bacto Agar (Thermo Fisher Scientific, DF0140), 0.3% glucose, 2 mM MgSO4 (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.075 mM CaCl2 (EMD), 0.004 mM FeCl3 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.01 mg/L Thiamine Hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) in distilled water and autoclave. Pour plates and let solidify while performing steps 38–39.\nAfter 16 h growth, dilute the bacterial propagation host culture 100-fold into 20 mL TB and culture until OD600=0.4 at 37°C.\nMix the resuspended plaques with 1 mL of propagation host, vortex at medium speed for 10 s and incubate at 4°C for a minimum of 15 min (up to a couple of hours), and mix 350 μL of the mixture with 3 mL of soft TB (0.7%) agar and plate onto propagation plates.\nIncubate the plates at 37°C without inversion until plaques cover the whole plate, typically <5 h.\nAdd 5 mL of SM buffer to each plate and incubate for 2 h on a shaking platform.\nPause Point: SM incubation can proceed for 16 h overnight.\nRe-collect 5 mL of buffer from the plate and add back 1 mL of fresh SM to the plate for 15 min at 4°C.\nCombine the second SM harvest with the first, mix with 100 μL of chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubate at 24°C for 10 min.\nCentrifuge lysates at 4,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min.\nCollect the top layer (above the chloroform) in a conical tube, wrap in aluminum foil to store in the dark, and store at 4°C.\nPause Point: We now have our stock of phage particles that can be stored until ready to titer.\nDetermine titers by plaque assay. Mix 50 μL of plating cells with 50 μL of phage stock (in serial dilutions from 1:103 to 1:109).\nIncubate plating cell/phage mixture at 37°C for 20 min.",
    "Mix 100 μL of phage/cells mixture with 3 mL of soft agar (TB + 0.7% agar) and plate onto TB Agar Carb plates.\nIncubate overnight for 16 h at 37°C.\nCount the number of plaques on the plate that contains between 10 and 100 plaques, multiply by the dilution factor and divide by the plating volume of the phage to get the titer in PFU (plaque forming units)/mL.\nTiters tend to be ∼109-1010 pfu/mL after plate lysis.\nPause Point: We now have our stock of phage particles ready for creating lysogens.\nLysogen Creation and Validation\nTiming: 3 days\nOnce phage particles are generated, these steps cover how to infect a non-lysogenic bacterial strain to generate lysogens with the recombinant phage. After infection and lysogen creation is complete, the bacterial strain that has phage integrated within its genome must be validated by colony PCR.\nGrow parent bacterial strains overnight (∼16 h) in LB supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic.\nNote: We have used both MG1655 and BW25113 E. coli lab strains in the λ infection protocol. These were transformed with a constitutive mCerulean3 expression plasmid (see Key Resources Table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) for compatibility with downstream live-cell imaging. The mCerulean expression plasmid contains a chloramphenicol resistance cassette.\nDilute 100-fold into fresh TB supplemented with 0.2% maltose, and grow until early stationary phase (roughly 5 h).\nNote: Maltose is specific to stimulating lamB receptor expression for the lambda phage; other\nbacterium/phage pairs may require different stimuli to express the phage receptor.\nCentrifuge cells at 8,000 × g for 1 min at 24°C and resuspend in 1 mL of 10 mM MgSO4.\nIncubate for 1 h at 30°C.\nMix 50 μL of cells with 50 μL phage at Multiplicity of Infection (MOI) 0.01 and incubate at 4°C for 30 min.",
    "Combine the mixture of cells and phage with 900 μL of pre-warmed LB + 10 mM MgSO4 and incubate for 45 min at 30°C.\nPlate 100 μL of this mixture onto LB + kanamycin plates to select for kanamycin resistant phage lysogens.\nIncubate plates at 37°C for 16 h.\nNote: If working with a temperature sensitive mutant of cI such as cI857, then this step should be performed at 30°C.\nPick several colonies with an inoculating loop and resuspend in 20 μL of H2O.\nValidate all generated lysogens by performing a colony PCR using 1 μL as template, as in step 26, with primers across the attR site to ensure phage integration.\nPause Point: The validated lysogens can be grown for 16 h overnight at 37°C in LB with kanamycin and glycerol stocked (15% glycerol) and stored at −80°C.\nLysis Reporter Functional Validation\nTiming: 2 days\nThe next steps demonstrate how to validate the function of the phage lysis reporter using live-cell agar pad microscopy and plaque assay. By live-cell imaging, the reporter can be validated by observing mKate fluorescence as a proxy for phage induction in the lysogen. Lysogens are stimulated with a DNA-damaging antibiotic, norfloxacin (NFX). DNA-damaging antibiotics such as norfloxacin are known to stimulate the bacterial SOS response, the main pathway responsible for prophage induction with lambda phage in E. coli (Matsushiro et al., 1999[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). Stimulated lysogens are then spotted onto an agar pad and imaged for several hours. Recombinant lysogens should also be validated by plaque assay comparison with the WT phage.",
    "Validate that the recombinant phage does not have different induction behavior from the WT by performing a plaque assay for spontaneous induction. First, inoculate single colonies of lysogens for the same E. coli strain of recombinant λ and WT- λ in 3 mL of LB at 37°C for 16 h.\nThe next day, back-dilute the recombinant and WT lysogens in 3 mL of LB supplemented with 10mM MgSO4 + 0.2% glucose and grow at 37°C until mid-exponential phase (OD600=0.4).\nSerial dilute each of the bacterial cultures in 1 mL of TB from 1:10 to 1:109.\nMix 50 μL of each dilution with 50 μL of plating cells (see steps 27–31 in Recombinant Phage Particle Formation), and incubate at 37°C for 15 min to allow for phage DNA injection.\nAdd 100 μL of phage mixture to 3 mL of 0.7% TB soft agar and plate onto TB Agar plates supplemented with carbenicillin.\nIncubate plates overnight (16 h) at 37°C.\nThe following day, 16 h later, count the number of plaques on the plate with between 10 and 100 plaques, and calculate the spontaneous induction frequency (PFU/CFU) for the recombinant λ and WT- λ.\nNext validate that the phage reporter functions by performing live-cell imaging. Inoculate and grow single colonies of non-lysogenic E. coli and lysogenic E. coli strain of recombinant λ in 3 mL of LB at 37°C for 16 h.\nThe next day, dilute bacterial cultures 100-fold into two flasks each of fresh LB, and grow until mid-exponential phase (typically 2 h until OD600=0.4).\nAdd 50 ng/mL NFX to the lysogen and incubate at 37°C for 30 min. Keep the second culture unstimulated and continue to grow for 30 min.",
    "Alternatives: Depending on the phage and bacterial strains of interest, other prophage induction stimuli may be used. Other DNA-damaging antibiotics may be supplemented, such as mitomycin C, to trigger the SOS response, or UV light or heat shock for temperature sensitive mutants.\nConcentrate each strain to OD600=0.2 and spot 1 μL onto individual agarose pads (described in Before You Begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]: Prepare Bacteria Culture Materials). See Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10] for detailed instructions on spotting and transferring the agarose pads.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/127-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10. The Workflow for Generating Agarose Pads with Bacteria for Live-Cell Imaging\n(A) Individual agarose pads are cut from a slab of 1% agarose with a biopsy punch. (B) Pads are transferred to a glass slide, and bacteria are pipetted to the center of each pad. (C) Pads are placed, bacterial side down, on a Lab-tek chamber. The chamber is sealed with parafilm prior to imaging. (D) The agarose pads are placed on a microscope with a 37°C environmental temperature chamber for live-cell imaging.\nWait 5 min for bacteria to dry onto the pads.\nUsing a scalpel, transfer pads into a Labtek Chambered Coverglass (1 well, Fisher Scientific) upside-down.\nAfter all pads are transferred, wrap the Labtek junction between the Labtek cover and base several times around with Parafilm, to maintain moisture (Fisher Scientific).\nTransfer the Labtek to a microscope.\nFollow the protocol in: Live-cell Imaging Conditions, steps 82–83.

In our model system, the mammalian cells and bacterial cells have both been engineered to constitutively express fluorescent proteins compatible with live-cell imaging. The RAW264.7 macrophages have been engineered to contain a far red nuclear marker - the fluorescent protein miRFP670 is fused to Histone 2B. The E. coli strain contains a plasmid with a constitutive promoter that expresses mCerulean3. For details on creation of these strains, see Bodner et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] and the Key Resources Table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table].\nOne day prior to imaging prepare bacterial and mammalian cell cultures.\nSeed RAW264.7-H2B-miRFP670 cells at 1.5 x 104 cells/well on a 2 μg/mL fibronectin-coated (Sigma, F0895) 96-well glass imaging plate (Fisher Scientific, 164588) in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Omega Scientific) and 2 mM L-Glutamine (Life Technologies).\nNote: The seeding density is determined such that the macrophages are less than 50% confluent on the day of infection.\nGrow up from single colonies of lysogenic and non-lysogenic strains overnight (∼16 h) in LB supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic.",
    "16 h after seeding RAW264.7 cells start the infection workflow. Pre-heat a large centrifuge, with plate adapters, to 34°C.\nBack-dilute E. coli (lysogenic and non-lysogenic) from those that were grown for 16 h in LB cultures, into fresh LB (without antibiotics) and grow to mid-exponential phase (OD600=0.4). Grow all E. coli strains at 37°C.\nNote: Always include a non-lysogenic strain control to monitor macrophages for efficient bacterial clearance and to have a negative control strain for the phage fluorescence reporter.\nNote: We optimized the strain growth phase by trying mid-exponential (OD600=0.4), freshly stationary (OD600=2.0) and saturated stationary strains (OD600=4.0). The mid-exponential phase E. coli are cleared the slowest by the macrophages, giving a longer time period for phage induction to occur. For other bacterial strains such as Salmonella, stationary phase cells may be used for the purposes of virulence factor induction.\nCritical: Always maintain RAW264.7 cells in antibiotic free DMEM prior to infection. If cells were maintained with antibiotics prior to the start of the experiment, wash the RAW264.7 cells twice with imaging media (IM), and add back 150 μL IM.\nAlternatives: For experiments using temperature sensitive phage, grow lysogens at 30°C.\nWash bacteria twice with PBS and resuspend at the appropriate concentration to achieve MOI 10 for live-cell experiments.\nFor MOI 10, since there are 15,000 macrophages/well, add 150,000 E. coli/well containing macrophages.\nWe make the assumption that OD600 of 1.0 = 8 x 108 bacterial cells/mL. For other strains of bacteria, you may need to do colony formation unit assays to determine the relationship between OD and cell count.",
    "Alternatives: MOI can be manipulated depending on the nature of the experiment. We optimized by trying MOI 1, 5, 10 and 30. While prophage induction was observed with each MOI, 1 and 5 required imaging many more cells, and MOI 30 led to poor macrophage health.\nTo infect RAW264.7 cells, add 5 μL per well of the lysogenic or non-lysogen bacterial strain. As a control, leave at least 2 wells uninfected to monitor cell viability during the imaging time course.\nCentrifuge plates at 200g at 34°C for 15 min, and incubate at 37°C for 1 h.\nNote: Since this is a long centrifugation step, we set the temperature of the centrifuge as close to 37°C as possible without overheating.\nNote: During incubation step, prepare the microscope settings and begin heating the environmental chamber to 37°C.\nAlternatives: Incubation time window is flexible; times can range from 30 min to 1 h depending on the nature of the experiment. Shorter incubations can be used to avoid missing the induction time window of temperature sensitive phages.\nWash cells two to three times with imaging media (IM).\nNote: When washing, make sure to pipette from a consistent corner of the well rather than the center. Pipetting into the center of the wells could disturb the cell monolayer.\nAdd back 150 μL IM supplemented with gentamicin to each well.\nSeal the plate with an AeraSeal and immediately image the cells with the lid removed to ensure adequate gas exchange.\nLive-Cell Imaging Conditions\nTiming: 2 days\nIn this final section, settings and conditions necessary for microscope preparation are outlined for both bacterial agar pad and RAW264.7 live-cell imaging.\nFor all imaging experiments, we use a Nikon Eclipse Ti fluorescence microscope, encased in an environmental chamber maintained at 37°C along with 5% CO2.",
    "The microscope is controlled by Micro-Manager.\nAll images are acquired on an Andor Neo 5.5 sCMOS camera.\nFor imaging agar pads:\nAt least 2 images/pad are taken in every 10 min intervals with a 40×/0.95 numerical aperture objective + 1.5× tube lens with 2 × 2 binning, at 37°C for 3–5 h.\nFor imaging infected mammalian cells:\nImages are taken at 1 h intervals with a 20×/0.75 numerical aperture objective with 2 × 2 binning for at least 18 h.\nImage an uninfected control well in order to monitor cell health throughout the time course.\nAt least 3 wells per strain and 9 fields-of-view are imaged per well.\nNote: 1 h interval imaging is required for a phage induction imaging experiment to allow for the imaging of 6 strains in parallel. A tradeoff exists between the number of positions that can be imaged and the interval between time points. Shorter time intervals may be used if one is imaging fewer strains.\nCritical: Focus images using the bacterial channel to ensure the bacteria stay in focus throughout the time course.\nAlternatives: Imaging time intervals, objectives, and binning can be changed depending on the nature of the model experimental system used.\nThe engineered E. coli λ lysogens contain a constitutive mCerulean3 plasmid as a bacterial cell marker and an mKate2 fluorescent protein in the late lysis operon. RAW264.7 macrophages contain an H2B-miRFP670 nuclear marker. See Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11] for example images from a 21 h time course.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/127-Fig11.jpg\nFigure 11.

Adapted from Bodner et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2].\nThe fluorescent markers dictate which microscope filter sets to use:\nDIC - for cell morphology\nFarRed - for nuclear marker\nCFP - for bacterial marker\nTRITC - for phage marker\nCritical: To avoid phototoxicity due to imaging in the CFP channel (mCerulean3), one can use the Neutral Density Filter (ND)-60 setting to dampen the intensity of light to achieve shorter interval imaging (<30 min). The 60 refers to the average transmitted light percentage by the filter, meaning an ND-60 filter transmits 60% of the incident light from the light source."
