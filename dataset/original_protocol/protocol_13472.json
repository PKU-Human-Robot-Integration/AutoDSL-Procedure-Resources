    "1. Cell culture\nPrepare complete medium for U87 MG cells by adding fetal bovine serum (final concentration 10%) and penicillin-streptomycin (final concentration 1%) to the minimum essential medium (MEM). Use plastic cell culture dish for cells subculture.\nPassage cells 2 to 3 times a week.\n\t\nRemove the culture medium and rinse the cell layer with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS) 2~3 times when confluent (80%~90%).\nAdd 1.0 to 2.0 mL of Trypsin-EDTA solution to the cell culture dish and observe cells under an inverted microscope until cells become round (3~5 min).\nAdd 3.0 mL of prepared complete medium and disperse the cells by gently pipetting.\nAdd cell suspension (1 mL) to new culture dish with fresh cell medium (3 mL) and resuspend the cells.\nMaintain the cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere.\n2. Microscope slide preparation\nNOTE: U87 MG cells of third to tenth generation with high activity are used in SPT experiments.\nSterilize 22 mm × 22 mm coverslips already cleaned with Piranha solution by immersing in ethanol (99.9%).\nUse forceps to take out the cover slip from the ethanol solution (step 2.1) and sterilize by burning ethanol on the flame. Once all ethanol is burnt, place coverslips in a plastic cell culture dish (35 x 10 mm) filled with 2 mL of cell medium (no phenol red).\nAdd 50 µL of the cell suspension from step 1.2.3 on the coverslip and gently push the dish back and forth and left and right to evenly distribute the cells. Place it in a humidified atmosphere.\nWhen U87 MG cells on the coverslip reach 20%–40% confluency (~12 h), add 20 μL of CTAB-AuNRs (138 pM) into the dish and disperse. Incubate in humidified atmosphere for 5 min.",
    "Add 100 μL of the culture medium (no phenol red) from dish in step 2.4 into the groove of the grooved glass slide (Figure 1) which is precleaned with Piranha solution.\nTake the coverslip out from the dish and inverted on the top of the groove of the microscope glass slide (Figure 1). Seal with nail polish, let it dry and place it on the stage to perform SPT experiments.\n3. Performing single particle tracking experiments with darkfield microscopy (Figure 1).\nPlace a drop of oil on the oil-immersed darkfield condenser (NA 1.43-1.20) and turn the knob to make the condenser contact the glass slide.\nPut a drop of oil on the top of the cover glass and turn the focusing knob to make the 60x oil immersion objective (NA 0.7–1.25) touch the oil.\nTurn on the light source and slightly turn the focusing knob to focus the imaging plane.\n\tNOTE: In the field of view, the background is black, the cells are bright, and the CTAB-AuNRs (aspect ratio~2:1, Figure 2) are small colored (red, yellow, or green) scattering spots.\nCapture sample scattering light by a color CMOS camera. Click “Camera icon” in the software to record and export TIFF format to save images.\n4. Data acquisition\nExtract single long-term trajectory\n\t\nOperate as described in Figure 3 to convert the time-series dark-field images from “RGB color” mode to “8 bit” mode. In the Image J click Image | Type | 8 bit. To adjust the contrast, click Image | Adjust | Brightness | Contrast.\nSelect a target particle and cutoff the time-series backgrounds by boxing and deleting the background with \"Ctrl+X\".\nOpen the particle detection and particle Linking window by clicking the “Plugins | Particle Tracker Classic | Particle Tracker”.",
    "Set Radius to 6, Cutoff to 0 and Percentile to 0.01%.\n\t\tNOTE: To detect the particle, adjust above three parameters with the assistance of Preview. Ensure that radius is slightly larger than the targeted particle and smaller than the smallest inter-particle separation. Percentile is the lower limit of intensity distribution that to be candidate particles.\nSet the Link Range to 5 and Displacement to 10.\n\t\tNOTE: To link the particle between consecutive adjacent frames, adjust the above two parameters. Displacement is the maximum pixels that a particle can move between two succeeding frames, and Link Range is the number of consecutive frames to consider when determining the best corresponding match.\nClick “OK” to open the ParticleTracker Results window to see the results.\nClick “Visualize All Trajectories” to inspect the generated trajectories.\nClick “Relink Particles” menu at the top to re-link the detected particles with different link range and percentile parameters, if the software generated trajectory does not match the moving trajectory of the AuNR.\nClick “Save Full Report” to save results if the software generated trajectory and the moving trajectory of the AuNR are matched.\n\t\tNOTE: An example of extracting single long-term trajectory with Image J is shown in Figure 4.\nExtracting Multi-trajectories\n\tNOTE: An example of extracting multi-trajectories with Fiji is shown in Figure 5. There are several stages, and each stage constitutes a step in the tracking process. The result of each step is displayed immediately, which allows the user to go back to readjust settings when the output is unsatisfactory.\n\t\nOperate as described in Figure 3 to convert the time-series dark-field images from “RGB color” mode to “8 bit” mode. In the Image J pathway click “Image | Type | 8 bit”. To adjust their contrast, click “Image | Adjust | Brightness | Contrast”.",
    "Open the start panel by clicking “Plugins | Tracking | TrackMate”. Click “Next”.\nChoose the “LoG detector” from the drop-down menu and click “Next”.\nAdjust parameters of the detector configuration panel. Set Estimated blob diameter to 10, set Threshold to 0, and Select “Do Sub-pixel Localization”.\nClick “Next” to open initial spot filtering panel.\n\t\tNOTE: Several parameters can be adjusted to further optimize the target points. In this example, no other parameters were adjusted.\nClick “Next” and select “HyperStack displayer” from the drop-down menu.\nClick “Next” to open Spot filtering panel. Set the Quality above 1.88, X above 38.86, Y above 56.54.\nClick “Next” and select “Simple LAP tracker” from the drop-down menu. Configure the simple LAP tracker by adjusting three parameters, that is, the Linking max distance = 15, Gap-closing max distance = 15 and Gap-closing max frame gap = 5.\n\t\tNOTE: Linking-max distance is the maximum displacement of a point between two frames. Gap-closing max distance is the maximum displacement of two segments. Gap-closing max frame gap is the largest frame between two points to be bridged.\nClick “Next” to track. When finished, continue to click “Next”.\nSet filters on tracks, such as set Number of spots in track above 300.\nKeep clicking “Next” until the final save panel open. Select “Export tracks to XML file” from the drop-down menu, and then click “Execute” to save in csv format.\nR/G values\n\tNOTE: Scattering intensities of targeted AuNRs in the R and G channels are obtained from color darkfield images by using a code written in MATLAB (https://github.com/fenggeqd/JOVE-2020/tree/master/RGandPolarangle), and the extraction principle is presented in Figure 6.\n\t\nUse the function of xycoordination.m to find the center pixel coordinate of the AuNR in each frame according to the x-y coordinate (extracted by ImageJ/Fiji).",
    "Use the function of RGextraction.m to delimit a 3 x 3 pixels matrix, extract the 9 scattering-intensity values of R or G channels, and calculate an average value (μ, defined as R or G).\n\t\tNOTE: The 3 x 3 pixels matrix is centered on the pixel coordinates obtained from step 4.3.1.\nPolar angle\n\tNOTE: The polar angle is the angle between the longitude of the AuNR and the optical axis (as shown in Figure 1), which can reflect the spatial (Z axis) rotation dynamics of the AuNR.\n\t\nUse the function of polarangle.m to calculate the polar angles (θ) by the dual-channel differential method22, imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61603/61603equ10.jpg.\n5. Data analysis\nNOTE: A systematic and robust data analysis framework is essential for the performance and efficiency of SPT analysis methods. The custom software written in MATLAB is used (https://github.com/fenggeqd/JOVE-2020/tree/master/Analysis_parameters). A graphing and analysis software (see Table of Materials) is used for drawing the plots.\nAnalysis parameters\n\t\nUse scripts of csv_data_extract_dis_vel_ss.m and csv_data_MSD.m to calculate dynamic parameters according to formulas shown in Table 1.\n\t\tNOTE: These parameters are used to analyze the dynamics of AuNRs and consist of three parts. (1) Trajectory related parameters: displacement, step size, velocity, radius of gyration (Rg), and turning angle (Ta); (2) MSD parameters: diffusion coefficient (Dt) and abnormal diffusion exponent (α); and (3) Rotation related parameters: polar angle and rotational lability (σ).\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\nMeasures,Definition,Definition,Physical meaning\nDisplacement,imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61603/61603equ01.jpg,imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61603/61603equ01.jpg,Changes in position of objects\nStep size,imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61603/61603equ02.jpg,imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61603/61603equ02.jpg,Distance between two adjacent points\nVelocity,imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61603/61603equ03.jpg,imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61603/61603equ03.jpg,Speed of objects motion\nRg,imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61603/61603equ04.jpg,imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61603/61603equ04.jpg,Moving range of objects in a specific time interval\nTa,imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61603/61603equ05.jpg,imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61603/61603equ05.jpg,Motion direction of objects between two adjacent points\nMSD,imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61603/61603equ06.jpg,imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61603/61603equ06.jpg,Average moving distance of objects in a specific time interval\nDt,imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61603/61603equ07.jpg,imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61603/61603equ07.jpg,Diffusion ability of objects\nα,imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61603/61603equ07.jpg,imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61603/61603equ07.jpg,Normal diffusion (α~1)\nPolar angle,imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61603/61603equ08.jpg,imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61603/61603equ08.jpg,3D orientation information of objects\nσ,imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61603/61603equ09.jpg,imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61603/61603equ09.jpg,Degree of dispersion of the polar angle data set",
    "Table 1: Three types of parameters used for analysis. These include trajectory related parameters (displacement, step size, velocity, Rg and Ta), MSD parameters (MSD, Dt and α) and rotation related parameters (polar angle and rotational lability).\nVisual analysis of trajectory\n\tNOTE: Trajectory visualization can intuitively present the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of particle motion and the trajectory (coordinate) distribution of dynamic parameters, such as time-mapping trajectory, Rg- and Dt-mapping trajectory, and polar-angle mapping trajectory. Mapping trajectories were drawn using the graphing and analysis software.\n\t\nSet x coordinate as X, y coordinate as Y, and time (Rg, Dt, polar angle) as Z.\nClick “Plot | Scatter plot | Color-mapping Plot”.\nAdd the color bar.\nMSD analysis\n\tNOTE: Motion activity and motion mode of the particles can be obtained by MSD analysis23. The larger the Dt, the more active the diffusion motion of the particles. when α~1, particles do normal diffusion motion, otherwise they perform abnormal diffusion motion.\n\t\nMSD-τ figures\n\t\t\nSet time interval (τ) as X, MSD data as Y.\nClick “Plot | Scatter plot”\nFit data by clicking “Analyze | Fitting | Nonlinear curve fitting (Function: Allometricl)”.\nMSD-τ double-logarithmic figure\n\t\tNOTE: MSD-τ double-logarithmic figure, whose slope is α and intercept is Dt, can intuitively present particle motion.\n\t\t\nSet logarithmic time interval as X, and logarithmic MSD as Y.\nClick “Plot | Scatter plot”.\nFit data by clicking “Analyze | Fitting | Linear curve fitting”.\nD-τ figure (MSD/4t)\n\t\tNOTE: D=MSD/4τ, is a function of time τ and anomaly factor α, and the D-τ figure directly shows the change of diffusion coefficient with time. When D increases with time, α is greater than 1 and particles do superdiffusion motion.\n\t\t\nSet logarithmic time interval (τ) as X, and logarithmic D as Y.\nClick “Plot | Scatter plot”.",
    "Fit data by clicking “Analyze | Fitting | Nonlinear curve fitting (Function: “Allometricl”)”.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The shorter the trajectories, the higher the inaccuracy of the diffusion estimates. In general, Dt and α through MSD-τ analysis of long interval time (> 30 τ) were obtained. However, simple and rough fitting will smooth out motion details. Hence, MSD-τ analysis of short interval time (< 10 τ) should be performed to analyze the motion behavior of particles in a short time.\nStatistical analysis\n\t\nMulti-particles statistical analysis\n\t\tNOTE: Multi-particles statistical analysis can reflect the motion state of particles in a spatial region, which indirectly indicates the spatial heterogeneity environment. For instance, if the histogram of Dt exhibits a large-scale distribution or multi-peaks distribution, it means that the motion activities of particles are heterogeneous.\n\t\t\nSet dynamic parameters (such as Dt, Rg, max displacement) as Y.\nClick “Plot | Histogram”.\nDouble click the histogram, and set division size or the number of divisions. Click “Apply”.\nSingle-particle statistical analysis\n\t\tNOTE: The statistical analysis of single particles can show the motion behavior of individual particles, which also indirectly reflects the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the surrounding environment.\n\t\t\nMultiple frames\n\t\t\t\nCalculate dynamic parameters (such as Ta, step size, polar angle) of all frames of single long trajectory, and copy to Origin table and set as Y.\nClick “Plot | Histogram”.\nDouble click the histogram, and set division size or the number of divisions. Click “Apply”.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: If both Ta and step size exhibit a small value distribution, the particles do a small-step super-diffusion motion.\nMoving windows\n\t\t\t\nCalculate dynamic parameters (such as Rg, Dt) of all frames of single long trajectory through moving-window method (11 frames), and copy to Origin table and set as Y.\nClick “Plot | Histogram”.",
    "Double click the histogram, and set division size or the number of divisions. Click “Apply”.\nTime-series analysis\n\tNOTE: Statistical analysis can reveal the motion state of NPs, and time-series analysis can present the motion behavior as a supplement. Combining several time-series parameters, it can discriminate the motion behavior of NPs at the temporal and spatial levels.\n\t\nSet time as X, time-series parameters as Y (such as displacement, polar angle and Rg).\nClick “Plot | Multi-pane diagram | Stacked plot | Line + Symbol”.\nSubscription Required.
