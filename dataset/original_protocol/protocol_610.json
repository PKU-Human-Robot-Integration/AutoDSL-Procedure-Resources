    "**Reagent Setup**\n**B5 cell culture media** Add 4 mg l<sup>-1</sup> 2.4-D, 2 mg l<sup>-1</sup> kin, 2 gr l<sup>-1</sup> activated charcoal, 30 mg l l<sup>-1</sup> sucrose, and 7 gr l<sup>-1</sup> of agar into B5 media and adjust the PH to 5.8-6.\n**Cell suspension media** Add 4 mg l<sup>-1</sup>  2.4-D, 0.5 mg l<sup>-1</sup>  kin, and 30 mg l<sup>-1</sup> sucrose into B5 media.\n**Ethanol\\(70%)** Mix absolute ethanol and H<sub>2</sub>O at a ratio of 70 ethanol:30 H<sub>2</sub>O\\(v/v).\n**Sodium hypochloride\\(2.5 %v/v)**  Mix sodium hypochloride \\(5%) and H2O at a ratio of 50 sodium hypochlorite \\(5%): 50 H2O ml \\(v/v).\n**Preparation of pegylated nano niosomal 2,4-D** SECTION 1 Dissolve 30 mg cholesterol in 30 ml ethanol. Then add span20, tween20, and PEG3000, respectively according to the Table 1. Add 5 mg 2,4-D to the above solution. The reactants were allowed to react for 30 minutes at room temperature on magnetite stirrer at 120 rpm .The solvent was evaporated by rotary evaporator. SECTION 2 Add 50 ml sterilized distilled water to the gel containing 2,4-D. The obtained suspension containing 2,4-D was subjected to sonication by ultra sonic sonicator. This was further passed through filter 0.22µm in order to obtain uniform niosomes.\n**Extraction medium** Mix methanol and hydrochloric acid at a ratio of 75 methanol:25 hydrochloric acid \\(v/v).\nPreparation of mobile phases Mix methanol, H2O, and acetonitrile at a ratio of 5 methanol : 35 H2O: 60 acetonitrile \\(v/v).CRITICAL It is important that the solution should be filtered before use.\n**TABLE 1.

Soak the samples in the water containing dish washing liquid for sterilization and then place them under running water for 20 minutes\n  2.  Wash the explants with 70 % ethanol for 1 minute",
    "3. Transfer the samples to 2.5 % sodium hypochlorite containing two drops of tween 20 for 15 minutes\n  4.  Wash the samples with the sterilized distilled water for 3 times, and each time for 15 minutes\n  **Tissue culture proliferation** TIMING 60 days\n5. Dry the explants on filter paper, and then transfer the lateral meristem into B5 media, including 2,4-D \\(4 mg.l<sup>-1</sup>), Kin \\(0.5 mg.l<sup>-1</sup>), and activated charcoal \\(2 gr.l<sup>-1</sup>)\n  6.  Incubate the samples at 25° C ,completely dark condition for a month\n  7.  Subculture the explants into B5 media containing 2.4-D \\(4 mg.l<sup>-1</sup>), Kin \\(0.5 mg.l<sup>-1</sup>), and activated charcoal \\(2 grl<sup>-1</sup>) and incubate the explants at 25°C ,completely dark condition for a month\n  CRITICALSTEP Measure different traits of callus for determination of : 1.Dry weight 2.Fresh weight 3.Callus surface 4.Callus mass and 5.Percentage of surviving\n**Cell suspension growth in presence of nano niosomal 2,4 D** TIMING 25 days\n8.  Add 2 g callus \\(biomass) to 50 ml cell suspension medium and then incubate them at 25°C , 130 rpm , completely dark condition\n  9.  Add nanoparticles into cell suspension growth media at logarithmic phase, \\(21 days)\n  CRITICALSTEP To determine the logarithmic growth phase, take 1 ml cell suspension every day, centrifuge at 13000 rpm for 10 min, wash the cells with sterile distilled water thrice and then weigh out the cells.\n10. After 96 h, remove the cells by centrifugation at 13000 rpm for 10 min\n  12.  Discard the supernatant and transfer the precipitated cells to a 2 ml tube.\n  **Extraction of crud Taxol from the cells** TIMING 2hours\n13.  Homogenate 1 g of samples with 1 ml extraction buffer\n  14.  Place the homogenate at room temperature for 1 h and vortex it each 5 min\n  15.  Remove the cell debris by centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 10 min",
    "16.  Transfer the supernatant to a new tube, and then filter through filter paper 0.22 µm, the extract was used to determine Taxol content by HPLC method.\n  \nFigure 1 shows a schematic model of all steps in Taxol extraction procedure.\nFigure 2 shows a schematic model of all steps in pegylated nano niosomal 2,4 D- preparation.\n."
