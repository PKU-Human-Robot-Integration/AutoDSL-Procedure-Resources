    "1. Growing plants\nNOTE: Considering that a single barley plant usually has 5 to 6 tillers and only the middle 5 to 6 spikelets of each spike should be used for dissection, then a maximum yield per plant is 72 seeds for two-row and 216 seeds for six-row cultivars.\nTo germinate barley seeds, prepare a Petri dish padded with three layers of cellulose tissue paper covered with one layer of filter paper. Moisturize it with distilled water, so there is no excess water, put the seeds on the surface and close the Petri dish. Filtration paper avoids growing the roots through the cellulose tissue. Germinate the seeds for 3 days at 25 °C in the dark.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, germinate seeds by putting them directly in a wet soil mixture (see step 1.2).\nTransfer germinated seeds with a visible radicle and shoot of about 5 cm into 5 cm x 5 cm peat pots with a mixture of soil and sand (3:1, v/v). Water regularly. After 10 days, transfer the plants into 12 cm x 12 cm pots filled with the same soil mixture.\nGrow the plants in a climatic chamber under the controlled long-day regime (16 h day 20 °C, 8 h night 16 °C; light intensity 200 µmol m-2 s-1; humidity 60%).\n\tNOTE: Spring barley requires approximately 8-10 weeks from sowing to the beginning of anthesis, with no requirement for vernalization. Winter barley needs 7-8 weeks of vernalization (short-day conditions, 8 h day 4 °C, 16 h night 4 °C; light intensity 200 µmol m-2 s-1; humidity 85%) to induce flowering.\n2. Determination of pollination",
    "NOTE: Precise determination of pollination is needed for proper estimation of developmental progression. Barley is a self-pollinating species. To define day of pollination (DOP), we monitored the day of self-pollination. This trait is cultivar specific, but starting protrusion of the awns from the leaf sheath is a good indicator of approaching DOP (Figure 1B).\nOpen the leaf-sheath covering the spike. Use fine-pointed tweezers to check anthers and the ovary inside the spikelets in the central part of the spike. Spikelets with yellow anthers and “fluffy” stigma will pollinate within few hours16 and are considered as DOP (Figure 1B).\nClip off the spike near the tip of the last spikelet, and remove the flag leaf and the upper part of the awns. Then, clip off the top 1/3 of hulls in each spikelet. This dries the anthers and leads to their more synchronized opening and release of pollen.\nCover the spike with a glassine bag with the spike ID, plant number and defined DOP date. This also prevents cross-pollination, which may compromise specific experiments.\nNote the information to a tabular editor. Use the following formula to calculate the day after pollination (DAP) when tissue isolation should take place.\nxDAP = DOP + x\n\tx = expected DAP\n\tNOTE: The values should have ‘Data’ format.\nFor seed tissues dissection, collect the spikes at DAP according to the prepared tabular calendar.\n3. Dissection of the seed tissues",
    "NOTE: The following steps should be performed using a stereomicroscope. Remove the hulls before dissection using tweezers. Note that hulls become drier and more adherent from around 16 DAP. To keep physiological conditions and avoid drying of the plant materials during dissection, moisten the samples by putting them into a drop of 1x PBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, pH = 7.4). Use a new seed for dissection of each tissue to avoid DNA, RNA, or protein degradation due to extended sample collection time. For RNA isolation from dissected material, use only RNase-free materials and chemicals. Do not exceed the total dissection time 15 minutes for one sample consisting typically from tissues dissected from 5-10 seeds to minimize RNA degradation.\nRemove the rest of the hulls using fine-pointed tweezers before tissue dissection. Moisturizing with 1× PBS for 1 minute helps to remove dry residues of the spikelet.\nPlace the peeled seed on a Petri dish with a drop of 1× PBS and dissect individual parts using fine-pointed tweezers, fine-needle, and microcapillary pipette. A slightly different strategy is applied for dissection of individual tissues: the seed maternal tissues (step 3.3), the embryo (step 3.4) and the endosperm (step 3.5).\nDissection of seed maternal tissues\n\t\nDissection from seeds up to 8 DAP\n\t\t\nPlace a seed on the dorsal side and gently cut the seed along a longitudinal axis, and peel off seed maternal tissues except the last layer bordering endosperm from the apical to the basal part using tweezers.",
    "Collect seed maternal tissues from 5 to 10 seeds into a 1.5 mL tube with 50 µL of 1× PBS, discard the buffer using a pipette, rinse the tissue twice with 100 µL of PBS, remove excessive buffer by pipetting and close the tube and freeze in liquid nitrogen or use directly for flow cytometric ploidy measurement. The amount of material is sufficient for typically one downstream application (e.g., RNA isolation or flow cytometric ploidy measurement).\nDissection from seeds after 8 DAP\n\t\t\nPlace a seed on the dorsal side, gently cut in the middle of the ventral side of seed maternal tissues and gradually peel off the tissue around whole seed including nucellar projection. For each downstream application collect and wash the tissue from 5 to 10 seeds as described in step 3.3.1.\nDissection of embryo\n\t\nDissection from seeds at 8 DAP and younger\n\t\t\nPlace a seed on the dorsal side and cut basal 1/3 of the seed. Carefully split separated part in half and release the embryo. For each downstream application collect and wash the embryos from 10 to 20 seeds as described in 3.3.1.\nDissection from seeds after 8 DAP\n\t\t\nPlace a seed on the dorsal side and remove seed maternal tissues from the basal part of the ventral side. Gently disturb the thin layer of endosperm around the perimeter of the embryo by fine-needle or fine-pointed tweezers and peel out the embryo. For each downstream application collect and wash embryos from up to 5 seeds as described in 3.3.1.\nDissection of endosperm\n\t\nDissection of syncytial endosperm from 4 DAP seeds.",
    "Place a seed on the dorsal side, and remove seed maternal tissues except the last layer of cells bordering endosperm. Gently puncture layer in the middle of the ventral side by a thin needle, and suck the syncytial endosperm by capillary action using a microcapillary pipette.\nFor each downstream application collect liquid endosperms from 10 to 15 seeds into a new 1.5 mL tube with buffer suitable for the planned downstream analysis (i.e., 1x PBS, RNA isolation buffer, flow cytometry buffer). Buffer volume should reflect the protocol for the planned downstream aplication. Freeze in liquid nitrogen.\nDissection of celullarizing endosperm from 5 to 8 DAP seeds\n\t\t\nPlace a seed on the dorsal side, and remove all seed maternal tissues and embryo. For each downstream application collect and wash the endosperm from 10 to 15 seeds into a new 1.5 mL tube with 1x PBS and freeze in liquid nitrogen.\nDissection of celullarized endosperm from seed after 8 DAP\n\t\t\nPlace a seed on the dorsal side, remove all seed maternal tissues and embryo. For each downstream application collect and wash endosperm from a single seed per tube as described in step 3.3.1.\nStore the tubes with isolated material at – 80 °C until use.\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\n4. Control of tissue purity using flow cytometry",
    "NOTE: The sample purity can be checked using flow cytometry before RNA isolation. Proper instrument calibration is critical for the biological sample analysis. The flow cytometer/ploidy analyzer optics should be adjusted using calibration beads (fluorescently stained polystyrene microspheres highly uniform with respect to their size and fluorescence intensity) until the maximal peak sharpness, typically reaching the coefficient of variation (CV) < 2%. Cereal seed tissues contain mainly populations of G1, G2 and endoreduplicated nuclei; therefore, using a logarithmic scale is recommended. Start with a leaf tissue that contains mostly G1 nuclei and serves as a basal ploidy control.\nUse freshly prepared samples kept on ice (see step 3.3.1) or frozen tissue as described17.\n\tNOTE: Because the whole < 8 DAP sample is used for flow cytometry, this represents only an indirect control. We recommend researchers performing multiple isolations and measurements until reaching high proportion of pure samples (>90%) before proceeding to RNA isolation with < 8 DAP samples.\nRelease the nuclei from the 4 and 8 DAP embryo samples (for other samples see step 4.4) by homogenizing the tissues by 5 to 10 turns of the plastic pestle in 1.5 mL tube containing 300 µL of Otto I buffer (0.1 M citric acid monohydrate, 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20, filtered through a 0.22 µm filter)18.\nFilter the crude suspension through 50 µm nylon mesh into a flow-cytometry analysis tube and add 600 µL of Otto II buffer (0.4 M Na2HPO4·12H2O) containing 2 µg mL-1 DAPI (4´,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)18 to stain DNA.\nPlace all other tissues (including 16 DAP or older embryos) on a Petri dish containing 500 µL of Otto I buffer and homogenized by chopping with a razor blade. Filter the suspension as in step 4.3 and stain with 1 mL of Otto II buffer containing DAPI.",
    "NOTE: Manipulation with a sharp double edge razor blade requires special attention. To reduce the risk of injury, there are a single edge razor blades or special blade holders available.\nEstimate the nuclear DNA content of the sample using a flow cytometer. At least 2000 particles per sample are required for analyzing the sample purity.\n5. RNA isolation and quality measurement\nUse frozen tissue to prevent RNA degradation by endogenous ribonucleases. From seed maternal tissues and embryo samples isolate RNA using commercially available kits or TRIzol reagent19. Due to a high starch content in endosperm tissues, isolate total RNA from all samples using commercial on-column RNA extraction protocols for problematic tissues (e.g., Spectrum Plant Total RNA Kit) with an on-column DNase I treatment20.\nMeasure RNA concentration and integrity using a dedicated protocol for RNA gel electrophoresis or Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.\n\tNOTE: Intact total RNA has a clear 18S and 25S rRNA bands/peaks of size around 1.9 and 3.7 kb respectively. The 25S rRNA band should be approximately two times more intense than the 18S rRNA band.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
