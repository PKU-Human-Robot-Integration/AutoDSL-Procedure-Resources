    "Ethics Statement: Procedures involving animal subjects have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Virginia Tech.\nCaution: Extreme precautions must be taken when handling and disposing several components used in this protocol. Before use, the local institutional guidelines and health and safety practices must be established and followed, particularly for osmium tetroxide, which is volatile and extremely poisonous, uranyl acetate, which is both a heavy metal and source of radioactivity, and lead nitrate, which is a heavy metal poison. Thiocarbohydrazide (TCH) can decompose to produce explosive and poisonous gases, if incorrectly handled. Many institutions will have an EM core facility in which these reagents are routinely utilized and can provide assistance.\n1. Preparation of Brain Tissue and SBFSEM Imaging\nAnesthetize a young (~2 - 4 months old) C57 black mouse (C57BL/6J strain) using 4 - 5% isoflurane following the institutional guidelines. Confirm anesthetization by monitoring the loss of muscle tone, lack of voluntary movements and responses to aversive stimuli like a tail pinch.\nPin the mouse on a dissection tray and make an incision on the skin along ventral midline. Make further incisions in the skin to expose the rib cage of the mouse. Incise the diaphragm, and carefully dissect out the chest cavity along the periphery to expose the beating heart, and then make an incision on the right atrium.\nUsing a butterfly cannula, cannulate the left ventricle. Perfuse the mouse transcardially using 10 - 20 ml of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) pH 7.2, until exsanguination is confirmed by a change in the color of the liver.\n\tNote: A change in the color of liver is used as a guide to determine the extent of exsanguination. Confirm that the liver color changes from reddish brown to pale pink.",
    "Perfuse the mouse transcardially using 10 - 20 ml of 2% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde made in 0.10 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2), to fix the brain tissue rapidly from within. Fixation is monitored by observing the tail stiffening.\n\tNote: Prepare 0.10 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) by dissolving 2.14 g of sodium cacodylate in 80 ml water, add hydrochloric acid to adjust the pH, and make the volume to 100 ml with water.\nFollowing perfusion, decapitate the mouse, dissect the brain, followed by fixation in 0.10 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 2% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 hr at 4 oC.\nAfter 48 hr make 400 µm coronal sections using a vibratome and then carefully dissect the region of interest in the brain (for example, the hippocampus) under the dissection microscope 42. Carefully trim the tissue and take a picture for preserving orientation.\n\tNote: Post processing methods of tissue staining in SBFSEM combines a variety of heavy metal staining methods in order to improve resolution and are based on the method developed previously by Deerinck et al40.\nWash the glutaraldehyde-fixed tissues 3 times, 5 min each in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2).\nPrepare 0.1% tannic acid solution by dissolving tannic acid in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2). Swirl until dissolved and filter through 0.45 µm filter, if necessary.\nPostfix the tissues with cacodylate buffered 0.1% tannic acid by incubating in 1 ml reagent for 30 - 60 min at RT.\n\tNote: The incubation time is dependent on tissue size, but 30 min works best for most tissues.\nWash tissues 3 times, 5 min each in cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2).",
    "Dissolve 0.3 g potassium ferrocyanide and 0.86 g sodium cacodylate in 10 ml distilled H2O (dH2O). Keep the potassium ferrocyanide solution on ice. Just before use, add 10 ml of 4% osmium tetroxide (OsO4).\nStain the tissues with 2% osmium-ferrocyanide solution for 90 min, on ice. Wash 3 times, 5 min each in dH2O.\nPrepare 1% thiocarbohydrazide (TCH) solution by dissolving 0.1 g TCH in 10 ml dH2O. Dissolve at 60 °C by swirling every 10 min until fully dissolved. Observe safety precautions while handling TCH, particularly take care to avoid use of metals, heating to high temperature, or allowing solution to dry out.\nTreat the samples with freshly prepared 1% TCH for 20 min at RT. Wash 3 times, 5 min each in dH2O.\nDilute 4% OsO4 to 2% with dH2O, stain tissues with 2% aqueous osmium tetroxide by incubating for 1 hr. Wash tissues 3 times, 5 min each with dH2O.\nIncubate the samples O/N in 1% uranyl acetate in dH2O at 4 °C.\nPrepare Walton's lead aspartate solution (as described by Deerinck et al40).\n\t\nDissolve 0.998 g L-Aspartate in 250 ml dH2O and then add 10 N potassium hydroxide (KOH) in a dropwise fashion until the pH reaches 5.5. After pH adjustment, add 0.066 g of lead nitrate in 10 ml aspartic acid stock and heat to 60 °C for 30 min.\nRinse tissues in dH2O and incubate with Walton's lead aspartate stain for 30 min in a 60 °C oven. Wash 3 times, 5 min each in dH2O.\nDehydrate samples through a graded series of alcohol using chilled solutions of 20%, 50%, 75%, 85% and 95% ethanol for 5 min each, followed by 100% ethanol 3 times, 10 min each.",
    "Note: Use 100% ethanol from freshly opened bottle, as opened ethanol absorbs water from the air and cause embedding to fail. Longer incubations will be necessary with larger tissue samples.\nWash samples 2 times, 15 min each in propylene oxide.\nMake plastic embedding resin using 25 ml resin, 10.5 ml DDSA (dodecenyl succinic anhydride), 15.5 ml NMA (nadic methyl anhydride) and 1 ml DMP-30 (2,4,6-Tris dimethylaminomethyl phenol). Mix the resin by shaking. Spin and allow the resin to stand until bubbles resolve.\n\tNote: This is the standard medium hardness recipe. Other types of electron microscopy (EM) plastic resin may be used, but should be tested with a non-essential control sample in advance as not all resins work for SBFSEM.\nIncubate the tissues O/N in a 50 : 50 mix of embedding resin and propylene oxide, in a vial that is capped initially, then uncapped after 2 hr so that the propylene oxide evaporates over the period of about 8 - 10 hr.\nTransfer the tissues to 100% fresh embedding resin in clean vials for 2 hr.\nEmbed samples in fresh embedding resin, in flat molds containing printed paper labels, and cure them in an oven at 60 °C for 48 hr. After about 1 hr, check the tissue placement and alignment again, and adjust if necessary.\nTrim samples to the area of interest and mount on an aluminum pin using gelling cyanoacrylate superglue or a conductive epoxy resin, then coat with colloidal silver paste around the sides of the block to provide a conductive path to the aluminum pin.\nExamine tissue specimens using a scanning electron microscope system equipped with an in-chamber ultramicrotome stage and low kV backscattered electron detector 32.",
    "Note: Obtain instrument- and site-training in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) use and become an authorized user. Alternatively, collaboration with a researcher or core facility for small projects may be possible. Radiation training may also be required as SEMs generate x-rays.\nTo image the samples, use the following settings: 2.25 kV, at 5 - 10 nm/pixel resolution, with field sizes between 80 - 250 µm in x,y (other field sizes possible), and slice thickness of 50 - 100 nm, with a total of 250 - 600 slices in a 16 - 20 hr time period.\n\tNote: Settings vary substantially between different microscopes, individual samples, and desired resolution. These settings should produce images that are readily interpretable for many samples.\n2. Analyzing the Imaging Dataset\nNote: The Image J/Fiji software is used to analyze the dataset and relies upon the TrakEM2 plugin. Preprocessing steps may be performed using a variety of software, and may be extensive or minor depending on experience level and the stacks obtained. The main transformations using the open-source software (ImageJ ver 1.50b, FIJI download Oct 1, 2015) are described here.\nConvert images to 8 bit tiff format from the original proprietary 16-bit images by opening in the software and selecting menu items Image→Type→8 bit.\n\t\nIf automatic contrast/brightness conversion during this step is not ideal for images, reopen the 16-bit images, and press Image→Adjust→Brightness/Contrast. Select a range that works for all images, and press Apply. Then perform conversion. Note: On some SEMs, this step may require microscope manufacturer software.\nIf required, due to unacceptable image movement between slices (e.g. drift due to charging), register/align the image stacks (menu items Plugins→Registration→Linear StackAlignmentWithSIFT). In most registration software, set for \"translation-only\" mode rather than \"rigid body\".",
    "Note: Many approaches and software may work: the SIFT registration plug-in works for many applications and there is a virtual stack version.\n\t\t\nIf required, enlarge the canvas size prior to registration (Image→Adjust→CanvasSize) or reduce it to an area of interest (Image→Crop).\n\t\t\tNote: Some drift or splaying may occur, and trying other plugins or software may produce better results. Manual options are also available (e.g. ImageJ/FIJI, Plugins→Registration→ManualLandmarkSelection).\nIf desired, scale images to smaller, more manageable size (e.g. 25%) using ImageJ (Image→Scale).\nLaunch the software, select File→import→image sequence and then select the tiff files.\nLaunch the plugin by selecting File→new→TrakEM2 (Blank). Two windows will open; one manages the project and area_lists and the other manages tracing, and is referred to as the 'canvas'.\nLoad the image stack into the plugin by making a right-click on the canvas import. Select import and click on import stack. In the pop-up options, check the box for virtual stacks.\n\tNote: Although the image stacks are already opened in the software, they must also be opened in the plugin. The computer may run more smoothly if the virtual stacks box is checked.\nAfter the mipmaps are created and the stack is loaded, right click to name the project under the plugin window. Right click on 'new project' in the template column, and select 'add new child' for that project. Right click again to select 'area_list'.\nSet the Z-axis scale of the project to agree with the original electron micrograph settings by right clicking on the canvas, then click display and select calibration. Also, set the Z-scale by selecting all layers in the plugin window, right click to select scale Z and thickness.",
    "Click and drag the 'project' and all 'children' into the project objects section to create the 'area lists' under the 'Z space' tab in the canvas window.\nSelect the 'area list' and right click to select and set a color. Now, use the paint brush tool to trace objects such as mitochondria, in the electron micrograph images. Use 'Shift + click' to fill in an enclosed circle, 'Ctrl + scroll' to zoom in and out, and 'Alt + click' to turn paint brush cursor into an eraser.\nSelect two areas of ~10 - 15 µm by 10 - 15 µm at the top left corner and bottom right corner of the image and identify all mitochondria within these areas to allow unbiased sampling of mitochondria in each dataset.\nOn the 'canvas', observe and trace mitochondria throughout the sections. Note: Mitochondria are quite dark/dense appearing organelles, of similar size in diameter and loosely cylindrical. The unique cristae formed by the inner membrane are easily distinguishable inside this organelle.\nWhen finished with tracing, right click on the area_list under the Z space tab, select 'Show in 3D'. This will launch the 3D viewer plugin to view a 3D reconstruction of the traced image.\n\t\nTo perform mitochondrial volume measurements, select object in 3D viewer, click on 'Edit' tab and select 'Object Properties'. The mitochondrial volume estimate is listed along with several other measurements.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
