    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis protocol describes a 5-day SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion assay based on the HIV-1 Env protein-based fusion assay (Ikeda et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Kondo et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) with some modifications. Briefly, cells are seeded (day 1) and then transfected with plasmids encoding genes for SARS-CoV-2 S, DSP, and a SARS-CoV-2 receptor, such as ACE2 (and the serine protease, TMPRSS2, if necessary) (day 2). SARS-CoV-2 S protein-expressing cells are then re-plated in a 96-well plate (day 3), RL substrate is incorporated into the target cells, which are then mixed with cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 S (day 4), and RL activity is monitored over 24 h in the living cells (days 4–5).\nCells\nHEK293 cells (a human embryonic kidney cell line; ATCC, CRL-1573) and HOS-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells (HOS cells stably expressing human ACE2 and TMPRSS2) (Ozono et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]) were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S). Calu-3/DSP1–7 cells (Calu-3 cells stably expressing DSP1-7) (Yamamoto et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]) were cultured in Eagle’s minimum essential medium (EMEM) supplemented with 20% FBS and 1% P/S. HeLa-ACE2/TMPRSS2 (HeLa cells stably expressing human ACE2 and TMPRSS2; JCRB Cell Bank, JCRB1835) (Suzuki et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]) and VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells (VeroE6 cells stably expressing human TMPRSS2; JCRB Cell Bank, JCRB1819) (Matsuyama et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]) were cultured in low glucose DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1% P/S, and G418 (1 mg/mL). All cells were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2. Cells were split in the following ratio for passage; HEK293 cells and HOS-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells were 1:5 or 1:10. Calu-3/DSP1–7 cells were 1:2 or 1:3. HeLa-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells were 3:10 or 1:5. VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells were 4:10 or 3:10. Importantly, Calu-3/DSP1–7 cells needed daily medium change to maintain a healthy condition.\nPlasmids",
    "Plasmids expressing the codon-optimized SARS-CoV-2 S proteins of parent (S gene bearing D614G mutation) (Ozono et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]), Delta (Saito et al., 2022a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]) and Omicron BA.1 (Suzuki et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]) were prepared in previous studies. Each S gene includes the following amino acid substitution compared to the reference sequence of Wuhan-Hu-1 S gene (GenBank accession number: NC_045512.2); parental S: D614G. Delta S: T19R/G142D/E156G/FR157-158del/L452R/T478K/D614G/P681R/D950N.

The function of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins expressed by these vectors in HEK293T cells was also previously reported (Ozono et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nThe creation and generation of DSP1–7 expression vector pDSP1–7 and DSP8–11 expression vector pDSP8–11 have been described previously (kindly provided by Jin Gohda) (Kondo et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). It has been reported that the expression of the engineered dual split reporter proteins can monitor the fusion kinetics of HIV-1 Env protein (Ikeda et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Kondo et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7], 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nMaps of pC-SARS-2 S D614G, pC-ACE2, pC-TMPRSS2, pDSP1–7 and pDSP8–11 expression vectors created by SnapGene are shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2090-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

One well is used for re-seeding (step 7) and cell lysate preparation (step 21) and the other is used for quantifying surface S protein expression by flow cytometry (step 13).\nSeed 0.6–0.8 × 106 target cells per well in a 6-well plate.\nNote: Various target cells can be used, such as HEK293, Calu-3/DSP1–7, HeLa-ACE2/TMPRSS2, HOS-ACE2/TMPRSS2, or VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells.\nNote: In general, 0.75 × 106 target cells per well in 6-well plates are sufficient for mixing with 10–12 SARS-CoV-2 S protein-expressing effector cells if experiments are performed in quadruplicates (i.e., the number of target cells plated on day 1 are comparable to that in 40–48 wells of a 96-well black plate on day 4) (step 11). Calu-3/DSP1–7 cells should be seeded at a density of 0.8 × 106/well and the medium should be changed daily to maintain healthy cells until mixing with effector cells (step 11).\nPreparing effector cells and target cells by the transfection of expression vectors containing SARS-CoV-2 S, DSP, and ACE2 (and TMPRSS2) (day 2)\nTiming: 1–2 h\nTransfect the HEK293 cells with pCAGGS vectors expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S gene and pDSP8–11 using TransIT-LT1.\nDilute the following plasmids in a serum-free medium in an Eppendorf tube.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2090_4.csv\nAdd 2.4 μL of TransIT-LT1 reagent to the mixture.\nMix gently by pipetting, followed by incubation for 15 min at 20°C–25°C.\nAdd the transfection mixture dropwise to the corresponding well of a 6-well plate.",
    "Incubate the plates for 24 h at 5% CO2 and 37°C.\nNote: This step is for preparing effector cells (SARS-CoV-2 S and DSP8–11-expressing HEK293 cells).\nNote: A vector control using the pCAGGS vector (Niwa et al., 1991[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]) should be included.\nNote: In this study, we used the SARS-CoV-2 S genes of the B.1.1 variant bearing a D614G mutation, the Delta variant, and the Omicron BA.1 variant.\nNote: This is for one well of a 6-well plate. At least two wells of a 6-well plate are required for each SARS-CoV-2 S gene-encoding plasmid. Therefore, the double amount of the aforementioned transfection mixture is needed to prepare one S protein-expressing cells.\nNote: Many S protein expression plasmids have been used to characterize the virological phenotypes of newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants to date (Kimura et al., 2022a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3], 2022b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4], 2022c[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Motozono et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Saito et al., 2022a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14], 2022b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]; Suzuki et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]; Yamasoba et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]).\nIn parallel, prepare the target cells by transfecting HEK293 cells with pC-ACE2 and pDSP1–7.\nDilute the following plasmids in a serum-free medium in an Eppendorf tube.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2090_5.csv\nAdd 1.8 μL of TransIT-LT1 reagent to the mixture.\nMix gently by pipetting, followed by incubation for 15 min at 20°C–25°C.\nAdd the transfection mixture dropwise to the corresponding well of a 6-well plate.\nIncubate the plates for 24 h at 5% CO2 and 37°C.\nNote: This step is for preparing HEK293 cells transiently expressing ACE2 and DSP1–7 (HEK293-ACE2).\nNote: The requirement for ACE2 in this assay was previously reported (Saito et al., 2022a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nCo-transfect the target HEK293 cells in selected wells using pC-TMPRSS2 in addition to pC-ACE2 and pDSP1–7.\nDilute the following plasmids in a serum-free medium in an Eppendorf tube.\nNote: This is for preparing HEK293 cells transiently expressing ACE2, TMPRSS2, and DSP1–7 (HEK293-ACE2/TMPRSS2).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2090_6.csv",

    "Note: We used various cell lines as target cells in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion assay. For example, HEK293-ACE2 (Kimura et al., 2022b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Motozono et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Saito et al., 2022a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]; Suzuki et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]), HEK293-ACE2/TMPRSS2 (Kimura et al., 2022b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Motozono et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Saito et al., 2022a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]; Suzuki et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]), Calu-3/DSP1–7 (Kimura et al., 2022c[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Saito et al., 2022b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]; Suzuki et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]; Yamasoba et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]), and VeroE6/TMPRSS2 (Kimura et al., 2022c[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Suzuki et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]; Yamasoba et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]) cells have been used as target cells in previous studies. HEK293, HeLa-ACE2/TMPRSS2, VeroE6/TMPRSS2, and HOS-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells require supplementation with pDSP1–7, whereas Calu-3/DSP1–7 cells do not; therefore, the target cells used may require supplements (DSP, ACE2, and TMPRSS2) for successful SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion assay.\nRe-plating the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein-expressing cells (day 3)\nTiming: 1–2 h\nAt 24 h posttransfection, collect and re-seed 16,000 effector cells into each well of a 96-well black view plate (Key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#consortia]).\nAlternatives: The 96-well flat bottom plate listed in the Key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] can be used instead of a 96-well black view plate.\nNote: Occasionally, the RL signal indicating successful cell–cell fusion varies between the wells. Experiments should be performed in quadruplicate at least to obtain sufficient data for statistical analysis.\nNote: Detach the effector cells by adequate pipetting without using trypsin or any cell dissociation buffer. To avoid cell clumps, we repeated pipetting at least 20–30 times and verified the cells under a microscope. Adequate pipetting always detaches more than 95% of cells; unrepresentative cells, if any, are usually under 1%.\nRe-seed the remaining effector cells at a density of 0.6–0.8 × 106 cells per well in at least two wells of a 6-well plate.",
    "Note: one well is used for cell lysate preparation of immunoblotting and the other well is for flow cytometry in triplicate.\nNote: Approximately 64,000 effector cells are required to perform fusion assays in quadruplicate for each target cell type. A total of 1.5 × 106 effector cells is sufficient for a fusion assay, including cell mixing with one target cell type (step 7), flow cytometry (step 13), and immunoblotting (step 21).\nRe-seed the target cells at a density of 1 × 106 cells/2 mL/well in 6-well plates to prepare for the incorporation of EnduRen live cell substrate (step 10).\nNote: HEK293-ACE2, HEK293-ACE2/TMPRSS2, Calu-3/DSP1–7, HeLa-ACE2/TMPRSS2, HOS-ACE2/TMPRSS2 and VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells were used as target cells.\nNote: The detachment of HEK293-ACE2 and HEK293-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells is usually performed by adequate pipetting (step 7). However, the detachment of firmly adherent cells, such as that of Calu-3/DSP1–7 and VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells, requires the use of an enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer (Gibco, Cat# 13150-016; see https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/13150016[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/13150016]). In this case, cells are washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and treated with cell dissociation buffer for 10 min at 37°C. Next, the cells are harvested from the plates by gentle pipetting, transferred to an Eppendorf tube and washed with PBS. Finally, an appropriate number of cells is resuspended in a fresh medium to be added to 6-well plates.\nNote: One well of the 6-well plate contains sufficient cells on day 1 (step 1) to re-plate into two wells of the 6-well plate, which is sufficient for 10–12 effector cells if experiments are performed in quadruplicate (i.e., they are comparable to 40–48 wells of a 96-well black plate on day 4).\nNote: Step 9 is not necessary for Calu-3/DSP1–7 cells.\nIncorporation of RL substrate into target cells and mixing of target cells with SARS-CoV-2 S-protein-expressing cells (day 4–5)\nTiming: ∼30 h",
    "At 48 h posttransfection, incubate the target cells with EnduRen live cell substrate for 3 h at 5% CO2 and 37°C.\nDissolve 60 mM EnduRen solution in dimethyl sulfoxide.\nDilute to a final concentration of 60 μM with a prewarmed medium (1.25 mL of medium per well of target cells).\nReplace the cell culture medium with 60 μM EnduRen-containing working solution.\nIncubate the target cells with EnduRen for 3 h at 37°C.\nNote: Complete resuspension of EnduRen in a prewarmed medium is mandatory and is performed by adequate pipetting immediately prior to adding the medium to cells.\nAfter detaching the cells, add 32,000 target cells to each well of the 96-well view plate containing the effector cells.\nNote: The detachment of HEK293 cells is usually performed by adequate pipetting (step 5). However, the detachment of firmly adherent cells, such as that of Calu-3/DSP1–7 and VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells, requires the use of an enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer (Gibco, Cat# 13150-016; see step 7) after the 3-h incubation. In this case, the EnduRen-containing medium is removed and stored in an Eppendorf tube. The cells are then washed with PBS and treated with an enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer for 10 min at 37°C. After incubation, the cells are harvested from the plates by gentle pipetting, transferred to an Eppendorf tube and washed with PBS. Finally, an appropriate number of cells is resuspended in the stored medium for mixing with the effector cells.\nMeasure the RL activity at 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h using a Centro XS3 LB960 microplate luminometer with a counting time of 1 s per well (Troubleshooting Problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).\nMeasurement of S protein expression levels on the surface of transfected cells (day 4)",
    "Expression levels of SARS-CoV-2 S protein on the cell surface impact S protein-mediated membrane fusion activity. Therefore, the surface expression levels of S protein should be measured by flow cytometry and the fusion activity of SARS-CoV-2 S protein is normalized according to the surface expression levels (Kimura et al., 2022b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4], 2022c[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Motozono et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Saito et al., 2022a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14], 2022b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]; Suzuki et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]; Yamasoba et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]).\nStaining cell surface S proteins for flow cytometry\nTiming: ∼3 h\nHarvest the effector cells by adequate pipetting (prepared in step 8).\nIncubate the cells with rabbit anti-SARS-CoV-2 S S1/S2 polyclonal antibody (1:100) or normal rabbit IgG (1:100; as an isotype control) at 4°C for 30 min.\nAlternatives: Other anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibodies are available (Key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#consortia]).\nNote: It is critical to use an anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibody to measure the S protein expression levels on the cell surface because S protein expression levels are used to normalize luminescence and indicate successful cell–cell fusion. The normalized value represents the fusion activity of the S protein.\nNote: Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) data using rabbit anti-SARS-CoV-2 S S1 monoclonal antibody (Motozono et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Saito et al., 2022a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]), rabbit anti-SARS-CoV-2 S S1/S2 polyclonal antibody (Kimura et al., 2022b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4], 2022c[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Meng et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Saito et al., 2022a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14], 2022b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]; Suzuki et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]; Yamasoba et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]), and mouse anti-SARS-CoV-2 S monoclonal antibody (Suzuki et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]) antibodies are predicted to show variable patterns depending on their epitopes and potentially alter the reactivity with S protein with mutations in the epitope. Therefore, an appropriate anti-S antibody should be considered for each experiment.\nWash the cells three times with 2% FBS in PBS (2% FBS/PBS).\nIncubate the effector cells with APC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG polyclonal antibody (see the Key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#consortia], 1:50) at 4°C for 30 min.",
    "Alternatives: An appropriate secondary antibody may be selected depending on the primary antibody used for FACS analysis. The secondary antibodies used are shown in the Key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#consortia].\nWash the cells three times with 2% FBS/PBS.\nResuspend the cells in 2% FBS/PBS for immediate FACS analysis.\nAlternatives: To evaluate the expression levels of surface S proteins in live cells, 7AAD viability staining solution (BioLegend, Cat# 420403) can be used before the FACS analysis. After washing, the cells are treated with 5 μL of 7AAD solution at 20°C–25°C for 5–10 min in the dark, and then proceeded to the FACS analysis (step 19).\nMeasure the surface expression level of S proteins using a FACS Canto II clinical flow cytometry system.\nAnalyze the data using FlowJo software v10.7.1. Representative FACS data are shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] (Troubleshooting Problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2090-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

S protein-expressing-HEK293 cells were harvested at 48 h posttransfection and stained using rabbit anti-SARS-CoV-2 S S1/S2 polyclonal antibody. Expression levels of the indicated S proteins on the cell surface were measured by flow cytometry and are shown as the MFI in the histogram. Normal rabbit IgG was used as isotype control (gray). pCAGGS was used as the vector. The parent S protein was derived from the B.1.1 variant bearing a D614G mutation.",
    "(B) A summary of S protein expression levels on the HEK293 cell surface. The graph indicates the mean ± standard deviation (SD) MFI (n = 3). pCAGGS was used as a vector. The parent S protein was derived from the B.1.1 variant bearing a D614G mutation. Statistical significance was assessed using two-sided paired t test. ∗ p < 0.05 compared with the parent S protein (blue) and Omicron BA.1 S protein (green).\nImmunoblotting\nThe S1/S2 cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 S protein by cellular proteases, such as Furin, is important for the fusion of the effector cells to the target cells and subsequent pathogenicity. The Delta variant showed significantly higher fusogenicity of its S protein than that of the parental virus, which harbors a D614G mutation (Saito et al., 2022a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). This higher fusogenic potential was partially mediated by a P681R mutation in the S protein that facilitated S1/S2 cleavage and was associated with higher pathogenicity (Saito et al., 2022a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). In contrast, the S protein of the Omicron BA.1 variant showed less efficient S1/S2 cleavage and less fusogenicity to target cells compared with that of the Delta variant (Meng et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Suzuki et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]).\nFrom sample preparation to protein visualization for immunoblotting\nTiming: ∼3 days\nDetach the HEK293 cells co-transfected with the S expression plasmids and pDSP8–11 (prepared in step 8) by adequate pipetting 20–30 times.\nTransfer the cells into an Eppendorf tube on ice and pellet down by centrifugation (300 × g at 4°C for 5 min) for washing twice with 1 × PBS.\nAfter discarding the supernatant, tap the tube to loosen the cell pellets.\nResuspend the pellets in ice-cold lysis buffer containing the protease inhibitor cocktail (see “Materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]” section).\nNote: Approximately 1 × 105 cells are resuspended in 100 μL of ice-cold lysis buffer.",
    "Incubate on ice for 30 min.\nCentrifuge at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 15 min.\nCollect the supernatant in a new Eppendorf tube as total cell lysate.\nQuantify total protein using a Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent (Bio-Rad, Cat# 500006) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nNote: First, the working assay dye is prepared by diluting the concentrated assay dye at a ratio of 1:5 using deionized water. Then, 5 μL of the total cell lysate is added to 995 μL of the working assay dye by mixing well and the reaction mixture is incubated at 20°C–25°C for 5 min. After incubation, 200 μL of each sample is transferred into a well of the 96-well plate in quadruplicates. The absorbance is read at 595 nm by SpectraMax ABS (Molecular Devices). It is noted that the absorbance should be read as soon as possible as the absorbance increases over time and exceeds the detection limit. Moreover, samples should be incubated at 20°C–25°C for not more than 30 min. Finally, the protein concentration of each sample is calculated by plotting the sample’s OD value at 595 nm against the standard curve. The standard curve is established by plotting the OD value of 6 standard samples prepared by making serial dilutions out of 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin solution; 5 μL of each standard is mixed with 995 μL of working assay dye and the OD value at 595 nm is recorded after 5 min incubation.\nDilute the lysates with 2 × sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer (see “Materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]” section).\nBoil the mixture at 98°C on a heat block for 10 min.\nLoad 10 μL of each sample (50 μg of total protein) onto gradient 4%–20% SDS-PAGE gels for separation.",
    "Note: The molecular weight of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein is ∼180 kDa. Therefore, an SDS-PAGE gel that can cover a broad protein size range should be used.\nTransfer the proteins to methanol-activated PVDF membranes using a Bio-Rad wet/tank blotting system.\nNote: A wet tank transfer is recommended to successfully transfer high-molecular weight proteins.\nBlock the membrane with 4% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (0.1% TBST) under gentle shaking at 20°C–25°C for 1 h.\nIncubate the membranes at 20°C–25°C for 1 h or at 4°C for 12–16 h for protein detection with the following primary antibodies (Key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#consortia]).\nNote: A mouse anti-SARS-CoV-2 S monoclonal antibody was diluted at a 1:10,000 ratio in 4% skim milk/0.1% TBST. A rabbit anti-beta actin monoclonal antibody was diluted at a 1:5,000 ratio in 4% skim milk/0.1% TBST.\nWash the membrane three times with 0.1% TBST under gentle shaking at 20°C–25°C for 10 min.\nIncubate the membrane with the following secondary antibodies under gentle shaking at 20°C–25°C for 1 h (the secondary antibodies are listed in the Key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#consortia]).\nNote: A horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG polyclonal antibody or HRP-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody was diluted at a 1:10,000 ratio in 1% skim milk/0.1% TBST.\nWash the membrane three times with 0.1% TBST under gentle shaking at 20°C–25°C for 10 min.\nMeasure chemiluminescence using SuperSignal west femto maximum sensitivity substrate according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nVisualize only the bands that are not overexposed using an Amersham Imager 600 (Troubleshooting Problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5])."
