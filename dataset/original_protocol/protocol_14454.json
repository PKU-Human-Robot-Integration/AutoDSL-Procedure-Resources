    "The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Chonbuk National University approved this study. The treatment, use, and handling of animals followed all guidelines and policies. Maintain the operating room at 24 °C.\n1. Anesthesia\nAcclimatize miniature pigs, aged 12 months, in the experimental unit for at least one week. Perform a clinical examination measuring the respiratory rate, heartrate, and body temperature. Do not feed each miniature pig for 12 h before the anesthesia procedure.\nInject atropine (0.05 mg/kg) and ketamin (20 mg/kg)/ xylaxine (2 mg/kg)  into the lateral cervical muscle region, behind the ear, for premedication.\nAfter sedation, tightly apply a rubber band around the base of the ear and clean the ear with topical alcohol.\nPlace an over-the-needle plastic catheter in the ear vein and remove the rubber band. Confirm that the catheter is correctly placed. Flush the catheter with heparinized saline and fix with tape.\nFor endotracheal intubation, position the miniature pig in sternal recumbency. With the help of an assistant, hold the jaw of the pig with a suitable sling and open its mouth.\nPass the tip of laryngoscope into the pharyngeal cavity to displace the epiglottis from the soft palate. Use the tip of the laryngoscope blade to make the vocal cords visible and advance the endotracheal tube into the trachea during expiration.\nFeel for a free passage of air for proper intubation and check the chest auscultation for respiration sounds in both left and right sides of the miniature pig.\nFill cuff with appropriate volume of air of the endotracheal tube with air using a 10-mL syringe and fix the tube to the snout using adhesive tape.",
    "Provide a 2.0% concentration of isoflurane, an inhalation anesthetic for prolonged anesthesia, through the endotracheal intubation tube. Test the corneal and palpebral reflexes to confirm the anesthetization and use ointment on the eyes to prevent dryness.\nMonitor the cardiovascular system, the respiratory system, and the body temperature during anesthesia at least every 5 min until the miniature pig recovers.\n30 min before the spine surgery, apply 30 mg/kg cefazolin IV slowly, the 1st generation of cephalosporin antibiotics.\nAdminister 5 - 10 mL/kg/h of warm (37 °C) saline using an IV line to maintain homeostasis and provide 50 µg/kg/min of fentanyl to control pain.\nAfter the spine surgery, perform extubation when a strong swallowing reflex is apparent.\nTake the miniature pig into a room and monitor until it recovers from anesthesia. Provide food and water when the miniature pig is fully conscious.\nApply 3 mg/kg enrofloxacin antibiotic with 4.4 mg/kg carprofen daily for pain control during the first 3 days.\nMonitor the pig daily until the removal of the sutures.\n2. Spine Surgery\nAutoclave the transpedicular screws and posterior fixator systems for sterilization, following the manufacturer's guidelines.\nShave the back of the miniature pig, approximately 10 cm from the center to the left or right, using a shaver while the pig is in a supine position. Clean the skin with povidone-iodine solution and 70% alcohol.\nMake a longitudinal midline incision from the second spinous process of the lumbar spine to the first median sacral crest using a scalpel. Dissect through the subcutaneous tissue and fascia to the tip of the spinous processes.\nElevate the paraspinal muscles subperiosteally from the underlying laminae using a Cobb elevator. Dissect along the spinous process and lamina limited to the facet joints.",
    "Open the superficial cortex of the entry point (which is just inferior to the mammillary process from L3 to L5 on both sides) with a burr or a rongeur.\nInsert the guide pin at an open site, parallel to the superior endplate and at a 20° angle to the spinous process. Define the ideal starting point using C-arm or portable postero-anterior/lateral X-rays.\nInsert a pedicle probe up to 25 mm according to the X-ray. Confirm the complete intraosseous trajectory by pedicle and body palpation using a pedicle sounding device.\nInsert six pedicle screws into the prepared pedicle of L3 to L5 until the screw head is well-seated. Point the side opening of the implant head in the desired direction and align the horizontal position with the rod trajectory.\nInsert two rods into both sides of the pedicle screw heads, respectively. Put in the sleeve and nut at the pedicle screw head using a universal handle.\nLoosely tighten the nut using a straight socket wrench and firmly tighten the nut using a counter torque wrench.\nConfirm the positions of the pedicle screws using portable postero-anterior/lateral X-rays.\n\tNOTE: Wait for the miniature pig to wake up and check the gait patterns and motor function of the hind limb to determine whether a screw has been badly implanted.\nIrrigate the surgery site with 3 L of normal saline using a bulb irrigation syringe with suctioning.\nPlace a silicone drain in the surgery site and take out the silicone tip. Close the paraspinal muscles and subcutaneous using 1.0 metric absorbable sutures. Close the skin with 2.0 metric non-absorbable nylon sutures.\nDisinfect the suture site with povidone-iodine and apply a dressing using sterilized gauze and tape.\n3. Harvest Procedure",
    "At 12 weeks postoperatively, inject xylazine (2 mg/kg) and ketamine (10 mg/kg) into the lateral cervical muscle region, behind the ear, for premedication.\nAfter sedation, administer 15 mg/kg KCl  directly into the ear vein catheter for euthanasia.\nMake a longitudinal midline incision at the previous surgery scar lesion. Dissect the soft tissue and paraspinal muscles.\nExpose the spinous process of the lumbar spines, laminas, rods, nuts, and transverse processes from L3 to L5.\nRemove the nuts using a counter torque wrench and rods. Cut the L2-3 disc space and the L5-S1 disc space using an oscillating saw.\nDissect both sides of middle and anterior part of the L3-5 spine with a Cobb elevator and tower forceps. After harvest, if the spine cannot be tested immediately, wrap it in gauze soaked with saline and store at -20 °C.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
