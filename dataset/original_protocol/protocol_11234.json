  "procedures": [
    "All animals were housed and maintained in an AAALAC-approved facility, and experiments described in this protocol were approved by the MUSC Institutional Animal Care & Use Committee (IACUC). Animals for use in reciprocal transplantation should be an inbred or isogenic strain, with congenic status preferred or backcrossed for at least 6 generations.\n1. Harvesting donor rat mammary gland epithelium\nDetermine the number of donor rats needed for transplantation.\n\tNOTE: Generally, 1 donor rat (4 weeks of age) can provide enough cells for transplantation into 4 recipient animals. Certain applications of this protocol will require additional numbers of cells, and there can be strain-specific differences in total yield.\nLabel all supplies and ensure accessible placement for the surgeon (Table 1).\nRecord the body weight of each female donor rat. Follow institutional guidelines to fully anesthetize or euthanize the donor rat. Check for the depth of anesthesia by the lack of response to the toe pinch.\nMove the animal to the sterile surgical field. Place the animal on its back and spray the entire ventral surface with 70% ethanol.\nMake a sagittal, X-shaped incision, allowing access to thoracic, abdominal and inguinal mammary glands. Dissect all the mammary gland tissue from the donor rat using scissors (Figure 1). Remove all visible lymph nodes.\nExtract the mammary tissue using forceps and place in a labeled 60 mm dish on ice. Add 500 µL of serum-free DMEM/F12 media to the 60 mm dish. Adjust the placement of the mammary gland tissue so it stays completely wet.\nFinely mince the mammary tissue using scissors. To do so, cut the tissue into pieces 1-2 mm3 in size (Figure 1C). Keep the gland on ice until all the donor tissue has been harvested (do not exceed 60 min).",
    "NOTE: Additional personnel can mince mammary glands and additionally prepare collagenase solution while the surgeon proceeds with tissue extractions.\n2. Extract brain tissue from euthanized donors\nCarefully turn the body of the donor animal over to place it in a prone position. Secure with pins. Spray the head and upper back with 70% ethanol.\nLocate the base of the skull and make an incision beneath the occipital condyles. Insert sharp scissors beneath the skin and cut the skin away from the skull, including the sides of the head.\nUse bone cutters or strong scissors to cut the skull along the midline, from the occipital to frontal bones. Keep the blade as superficial as possible and angle upward to prevent the destruction of the underlying brain tissue.\nPeel the bone away using rongeurs or strong forceps. Insert the tool lateral to the cerebellum to break the bone on either side, exposing the bony auditory canal. Sever the connections to the meninges.\nGently lift the brain with curved, fine-tip forceps. Place the brain on a piece of foil and record the weight, and then immediately transfer to a 15 mL tube with an equal amount (w:v) of media, stored on ice.\n\t\nOptionally, use fine-tip forceps to remove the pituitary gland (located beneath the brain) for additional use in the transplant procedure, if needed.\nUse a mechanical homogenizer to disrupt the tissue. Homogenize the brain for 10-15 s on low speed. Let the mixture sit on ice for at least 1 min, and then homogenize again. Homogenization is sufficient when the final mixture is free of large pieces.\nFilter the homogenate by passing it through a 100 µm filter. Keep the filtrate on ice until use (less than 4 h).\n3. Digestion and processing of mammary gland extracts",
    "Thaw or warm reagents as indicated (Table 1). Follow the appropriate steps for recovering organoids or monodispersed cells.\nPrepare 10 mL of serum-free digestion media (without collagenase) for every donor animal (Supplemental File 1).\n\tNOTE: The volume of digestion media used can be adjusted (scaled up or down) to accommodate the grouped tissue, if applicable.\n\t\nFor organoids skip to 3.3.\nFor monodispersed cells, prepare fresh Monodispersion Mixture and Inactivation Solution (Supplemental File 2, Supplemental File 3) in addition to the serum-free collagenase digestion media. Proceed to step 3.3.\nWhen all the mammary tissue from donors has been extracted and minced, add the collagenase enzyme to the warm (or room-temperature) digestion media (Supplemental File 1). Mix by inverting.\nPass the collagenase digestion media through a 20 µm filter. Dispense 10 mL of filtered media in the labeled 50 mL tubes for digestion.\nUse a new 1,000 µL pipette tip for each sample and transfer the minced donor tissue from each 60 mm dish to the collagenase digestion tube. Cut 1 cm off the end of a 1,000 µL tip and manually place it on the device before use. Gently mix the minced tissue by pipetting up and down 1-2 times.\n\tNOTE: If the tissue is difficult to pipette during transfer, use a small amount of the collagenase digestion media from the 50 mL tube, and then transfer it back.\nPlace the samples in the horizontal position in a shaking incubator and allow the samples to digest 1.5-2 h at 37 °C, 200-220 rpm.\n\t\nFor organoids skip to 3.7.\nFor monodispersed cells add DNase I (0.2 µg/mL) to the mixture for the last 10 min of the digestion. Incubate as before, with vigorous shaking. Proceed to step 3.7.",
    "When the tissue is fully digested, pellet the suspension using cold centrifugation (4 °C) for 10 min at 1,200 x g (Figure 1D).\n\tNOTE: Keep tubes on ice between every step to increase viability of cells.\nEnsure that a pellet has formed, and then carefully pour off the supernatant and fat layer. Gently resuspend the pellet in 10 mL of fresh DMEM/F12 media.\nBriefly spin at 68 x g for approximately 10 s. The length of the spin (but not the speed) may be increased if there is no clear separation of cells. Visually inspect the pellet before proceeding (Figure 1D).\nCarefully remove the supernatant, leaving behind a small volume. Proceed to the next step, based on whether organoids or monodispersed cells are needed.\n\tNOTE It is important to leave a small volume of media in the tube because the pellet will be very loose. The residual volume of media will be diluted through wash steps.\n\t\nFor organoids, add another 10 mL volume of DMEM/F12 media and repeat the wash/spin. After the second wash, resuspend the cells in a smaller volume (1-2 mL) of DMEM/F12 media for filtration. Proceed to step 3.11.\nFor monodispersed cells, dissolve in 2 mL of pre-warmed HBSS with 0.025% (w/v) Trypsin and 6.8 mM EDTA. Digest for 3-5 min at 37 °C. Inactivate immediately.\n\t\t\nAdd 4 mL of DMEM/F12 with 10% FBS to stop inactivate the trypsin.\nSpin the cells at 270 x g for 5 min, and then resuspend in DMEM/F12 with 10% FBS again. Proceed to step 3.11 to filter the cells.",
    "Filter the cells using a 40 µm cell strainer placed in a new 50 mL tube. Pre-wet the strainer by pipetting 1 mL of the same base medium used to suspend the cells, and then pass the cell suspension through the filter using a pipette to collect ductal fragments/organoids.\n\tNOTE: The approximate yield of filtered epithelium from the mammary gland tissue of a single, 4-week-old donor rat is 1 x 106 cells.\n\t\nFor organoids, discard the filtrate. Mammary organoids will remain inside the basket of the cell strainer and smaller, unwanted cells will be eliminated. Invert the cell strainer over a new 50 mL tube, and rinse with any volume necessary to collect the cells. Proceed to step 3.12.\nFor monodispersed cells, discard the cell strainer and keep the filtrate because the mammary epithelial cells will pass through the filter, along with smaller stromal and immune cells. Rinse the tube that was used for the digestion/centrifugation with another volume of DMEM/F12 with 10% FBS and pass through the same cell strainer. Pellet the monodispersed cells by centrifugation at 1,200 x g for 5 min. Proceed to step 3.12.\n\t\tNOTE: The resuspended cells are ready for subsequent applications.\nPulse spin the solution and ensure the formation of a cell pellet before proceeding to the next step. Pulse spin again, if necessary.\nCarefully remove the supernatant. Resuspend the pellet in a small volume (1,000-2,000 µL of DMEM/F12) to concentrate the cells for counting.\nCount cells and dilute if needed. Resuspend the desired number of cells for transplantation in 20 µL of DMEM/F12 media for each animal. Always keep cells on ice.",
    "NOTE: Donor cell counts in the range of 1 x 105 - 1 x 106 cells will be required for each graft site based on the endpoint of the study. For example, carcinogenesis experiments often require a greater number of transplanted cells, relative to other applications. The number of cells needed must be experimentally determined for each strain. The procedure described in this protocol utilized 250,000 donor cells in 20 µL media per graft site, prior to mixing with brain homogenate, as described in step 3.16.\nPrepare any aliquot(s) of cells needed for other experiments (e.g., FACS isolation3,26,27,30,33).\n\t\nFor organoids, proceed to step 3.16.\nFor monodispersed cells, quantify the viable cells using Trypan or methylene blue staining, and then proceed.\nPrepare single batches of donor material for all the transplant recipients. Combine equal volumes of the cell suspension (20 µL) with 50% brain homogenate (20 µL) for every site of transplantation.\n\tNOTE: A total of 40 µL per site will be injected at each site, but it is recommended to include a minimum of 25% extra volume for waste.\nImmediately proceed to transplantation or freeze cells for the transplantation later (potential stopping point).\n\tNOTE: Frozen cells have not been tested with this protocol and will require optimization in advance of generating a cohort of animals for transplantation experiments. It is strongly recommended to transplant fresh cells.\n4. Transplantation procedure (recipient rats 4-5 weeks of age)\nWeigh each recipient rat and calculate the correct dose of approved analgesic that will be used in the procedure.\n\tNOTE: Body weights can be measured up to 24 h in advance of the procedure. Follow institutional guidelines to restrain or briefly anesthetize each animal for the duration of shaving.",
    "Shave the surgical area on each animal using electric clippers. Identify the base of the skull and start of the vertebral column. Approximately one-third of the way down the spine, shave a 3 cm x 2 cm area on the upper thoracic portion of the back.\n\tNOTE: Shaving can also be performed under anesthesia on the day of transplantation but must be performed outside the sterile field. Return the rat to its home cage until it is needed.\nLocate all of the supplies needed for transplantation (Table 1).\nEvaluate the Laboratory Animal Anesthesia System before use. Top off any fluids and replace any tanks or parts that are needed. Ensure the gas line to the anesthesia chamber is open and all peripheral lines are closed so isoflurane anesthesia and oxygen may freely flow to the animal once it is placed in the chamber.\nWarm heating pads to support the body temperature of recipient animals.\nGenerate the sterile field that will be used for surgery. Arrange the supplies as described in Table 1.\nAdminister preoperative analgesic to recipient rats as indicated by institutionally-approved animal care protocol.\nFlush the Hamilton syringes with sterile DMEM/F12 media to prevent loss of cells. Ensure the needle is secured to the body of the syringe, insert the needle into the liquid, and draw back the plunger. Fill to the maximum volume. Press the plunger down and expel the contents into a waste collection tube. Repeat 3-5 times.\nLoad the entire volume of donor material (prepared in step 3.16) into a separate syringe for each condition (e.g., control, treated, wildtype, knockout, etc.). Insert the tip of the needle into the liquid, draw back the plunger and keep the needle beneath the surface of the mixture as the volume in the tube decreases.",
    "NOTE: Include at least 10% extra volume in each syringe. Do not dispose of the remaining mixture close the tube and keep it on ice in case more is needed.\nInvert the syringe after it is fully loaded and press the plunger slightly to remove air bubbles at the tip of the needle. Proceed to the next step when everything is prepared.\n\tNOTE: Make sure the tip of the needle never touches any other surface, even within the sterile field. It is helpful to rest the body of the syringe over a small container of ice to promote viability of the cells.\nPlace the recipient animal in the anesthesia chamber and turn on the machine.\nWhen the animal is fully relaxed (does not react to tapping or gentle movement of the chamber), direct the anesthesia to the nose cone and transfer the animal to the sterile field.\n\tNOTE: Extended duration of anesthesia is not well-tolerated by rats. Complete the procedure for each animal in 10 min or less.\nPlace the animal in a prone position (on its stomach) so the back of the head and the upper spine is accessible.\n\tNOTE: Ensure adequate heat support for the animal all times and regularly assess the depth of anesthesia using a firm toe pinch.\nOptionally, apply ophthalmic vet ointment to prevent drying of the eyes.\nClean the freshly-shaved area to remove excess hair. Use a circular motion and apply 70% ethanol (or another reagent, per institutional guidelines) to the skin, followed by an antiseptic (such as iodine), and repeat. Place a towel drape over the animal so only the region for the shaved area is exposed.\nEnsure the animal remains unresponsive to deep stimuli with a firm toe pinch, and then proceed to the next step.",
    "Make a small (2 cm) interscapular incision using a sharp surgical blade.\n\tNOTE: The cut must be superficial, as the fat pad is located just beneath the skin.\nLocate the medial blood vessel for orientation (Figure 2B).\nLift the skin on one side of the incision using forceps and hold it away from the fat pad while the transplant is performed (Figure 2B). Insert the needle into the graft site.\n\t\nOptionally, move the tip of the needle inside the tissue and create a small pocket to collect the cells. Use a small, repetitive motion. Do not remove the needle.\n\t\tNOTE: This step is recommended for first-time users of the protocol. Use extreme caution when creating a pocket, as the interscapular fat pad tissue is very delicate.\nCarefully inject 40 µL of the cell mixture into the interscapular fat pad tissue. Remove the needle slowly.\nHold the tissue in place and allow the transplanted cells to settle for 3-5 s. Use an additional pair of forceps, if needed.\nRemove the needle. Repeat the injection procedure (steps 4.18-4.21) at the second site of transplantation.\n\tNOTE: The epithelium from one donor group can be injected into the same side of the fat pad in every animal, or alternating sides to prevent batch effects from the hand-dominance of the surgeon.\nClose the surgical wound using wound clips or sutures, and then discontinue anesthesia.\nProvide post-operative analgesic as indicated by institutionally-approved protocol.\nImmediately move the animal to a recovery cage with the heat support. Monitor for signs of distress such as bleeding from the incision or trouble breathing.\n\tNOTE: The animal should fully recover within 5-10 min. Refer to institutional guidelines for returning animals to the colony and post-operative monitoring after survival procedures.",
    "Optionally, perform carcinogenesis studies at the graft site(s) by administering carcinogens to the recipient rats 3-4 weeks after transplantation.\n\tNOTE: Typically, rat mammary carcinogenesis is performed using a chemical carcinogen treatment at 50-57 days of age. This treatment dictates the age of the transplant surgery (which must be done between 29-36 days of age) to allow enough time for the grafted cells to initiate growth of the mammary gland.\n5. Assessment of epithelial outgrowth\nMonitor the estrus cycle of rats through daily vaginal lavage and examine the cytology on a microscope slide. Begin 8-12 days before the endpoint of the study. Sacrifice all rats in the same stage. This is an optional step.\n\tNOTE: The rat estrus cycle is 4-5 days. Allowing the animal to go through 1-2 full cycles will facilitate interpretation, as lavage slides from previous cycles can be used for comparison.\nSacrifice transplant recipient rats 6-8 weeks after transplantation, per institutional guidelines.\n\tNOTE: Outgrowth is usually detectable 3-6 weeks after transplantation, but additional time may be required.\nPlace the animal in a prone position and clean the body with 70% ethanol. Lift the skin with forceps and make an incision along the vertebral column to expose the interscapular fat pad. Dissect the skin away from the tissue so the majority of the fat pad is visible.\nIdentify the medial blood vessel that separates the graft sites in the interscapular fat pad. Excise the entire pad as a single piece of tissue or cut along the blood vessel and remove sides individually.\nPlace the tissue on a positively-charged microscope slide for whole mount. Use 2 pairs of blunt forceps and gently spread the tissue to restore its original conformation on the slide.",
    "NOTE: Rat mammary tissue is extremely delicate. The edges of the tissue may curl under itself. Always handle with care and hold in place until the tissue adheres to the slide (a few seconds).\nWhole-mount at least one of the endogenous abdominal-inguinal mammary glands (with lymph nodes for orientation) for comparison.\nPlace the slides in 70% ethanol for 7-10 days to defat the tissue. Replenish ethanol as often as necessary to ensure the tissue does not dry out.\nPrepare alum-carmine stain and process the slides when the tissue is sufficiently opaque. Allow the stain to cool before usage (Supplemental File 4).\n\tNOTE: The stain can be prepared up to one day in advance of the fixation and rehydration steps. The solution can be stored at 4 °C and has limited potential for reuse.\nFix the tissue by placing the slides in 25% glacial acetic acid : 75% ethanol for 60 min.\n\t\nRehydrate the tissue through a series of 3 washes in a series of decreasing concentration of ethanol: 70% ethanol for 15 min, 50% ethanol for 5 min and dH2O for 5 min.\nStain with alum carmine for 4-8 days. Check the back of the slides each day to determine if the stain has fully penetrated the tissue. Proceed to the next step when the staining is complete.\n\tNOTE: Staining is complete when the thickest parts of the gland have a purple hue and no longer appear white.\nDestain and dehydrate the tissue by transferring the slides through a series of increasing concentration of ethanol: 70% ethanol for 30 min, 95% ethanol for 30 min and 100% ethanol for 30 min.\nPlace dehydrated slides in xylene for 3+ days to clear the tissue. Transfer to mineral oil for long term storage.",
    "After the slides have cleared, use low-powered light microscopy or high-resolution digital photography to acquire images of the slides for analysis. Ensure image acquisition parameters are consistent for all slides.\n\tNOTE: Epithelial outgrowth must be clearly distinguishable.\nTreat the presence of outgrowth as a binary outcome.\nCalculate the mean number of transplanted epithelial cells that produced ≥1 mammary outgrowth in 50% of graft sites using the acquired images. Quantification other physical features, as needed.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
