    "All animal studies were carried out in accordance with the Committee on the Use of Live Animals in Teaching and Research (CULATR) in the Centre for Comparative Medicine Research (CCMR) at the University of Hong Kong, a program accredited by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC). The animals used in the study were female BALB/cAnN-nu (Nude) mice at the age of 6-8 weeks, weighted at 20 g ± 2 g. Food and water were provided ad libitum.\n1. Subcutaneous injection of human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines\nNOTE: MHCC97 is a human HCC cell line that is used to generate the subcutaneous HCC xenograft model. MHCC97L cells are obtained from the Liver Cancer Institute, Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, the People's Republic of China9 and authenticated by short tandem repeat (STR) profiling.\nCulture MHCC97L cells and maintain in culture media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin in a T-75 cell culture flask at 37 °C in a humidified incubator supplied with 5% CO2 (see Table of Materials). Change the culture media every 2 days and harvest the cells at 80%-90 % confluency.\n\tNOTE: The starting cell number is 1.5 x 106 cells, and the cells are used within 6-8 passages.\nStore the culture media and trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (trypsin-EDTA) at 4 °C in the dark until use. Pre-warm the culture media to 37 °C and the trypsin-EDTA to room temperature before use. Refer to the Table of Materials for all reagents and consumables used in this section.\nRemove the culture media. Rinse the cell layer with 10 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS, see Table of Materials).",
    "Add 5 mL of trypsin-EDTA to the culture flask and incubate the cells at 37 °C. Check the cells under an inverted microscope at 20x magnification (see Table of Materials) until the cell layer is dispersed and completely detached from the flask. Make sure that the cells are not left in trypsin-EDTA for more than 15 min.\nAdd 5 mL of culture media to the culture flask. Aspirate the cells by pipetting gently. Transfer the cell suspension to a centrifuge tube and spin at 1,107 x g for 5 min (see Table of Materials).\nRemove the supernatant and gently resuspend the cell pellet with 1 mL of PBS. Pipette thoroughly to obtain a single-cell suspension. Determine the cell number using the automated cell counter (see Table of Materials) and prepare the cell suspension to a concentration of 5 x 106 cells/mL in PBS.\nDraw up 200 μL of cell suspension with a 25 G needle in a 1 mL syringe. Each syringe contains 1 x 106 MHCC97L cells (in 200 μL). Keep the syringe on wet ice.\nAnesthetize the mouse with an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of a mixture of ketamine (87.5 mg/kg) and xylazine (12.5 mg/kg). Ensure proper anesthesia using the toe-pinch reflex. Make sure to apply eye lubricant to the mouse to prevent drying and the potential formation of corneal ulcers. Place the mouse in a supine position on a sterile pad (see Table of Materials).\nSterilize the dorsal region near the lower flank (either left or right side) of the mouse with 70% ethanol (see Table of Materials). Lift the skin up with forceps and gently insert the needle bevel up underneath the skin.",
    "Advance the needle 4-5 mm along the subcutaneous plane from the puncture site to avoid accidental leakage of the cell suspension from the injection site upon withdrawal of the needle. Make sure that the needle insertion is not too deep under the skin, which may cause accidental organ damage.\nRelease the forceps and carefully and slowly discharge the contents of the syringe, taking care not to penetrate the opposite side. Pull out the needle to check for a swell on the injection. Place the mouse back into the cage sitting on top of a pre-warmed heating pad to assist with recovery from the anesthesia and to regain mobility. Continue to monitor the mouse until the mouse is fully awake and maintains sternal recumbency.\nMonitor the tumor growth and wellbeing of the mouse on a weekly basis. Measure the tumor volume (V) using a caliper (see Table of Materials). Calculate and record the tumor volume using the following formula10:\n\tV = (W2× L)/2\n\twhere W is the width and L is the length of the tumor.\nBetween 4-6 weeks post injection, check that a significant size of subcutaneous tumor, between 800-1000 mm3, is obtained. Make sure that the total tumor load does not exceed 10% of the body weight.\n2. Orthotopic liver implantation and hepatic artery ligation\nPrepare the following surgical reagents and tools in a disinfected biological safety cabinet: 10 mL of culture media in a dish, 10% povidone-iodine solution, 70% ethanol, autoclaved surgical instruments, i.e., sharp scissors, spring scissors, forceps (curved fine and straight blunt), needle holder, scalpel blade, 6-0 and 5-0 nylon suture, a heating pad.",
    "Autoclave all the surgical instruments and handle them only on a sterile bench. Provide the adequate and necessary pre-, intra-, and post-operative care to the mice throughout the surgical procedures (see steps below).\n\t\nFor pre-operative pain relief, inject the mouse with a subcutaneous injection of buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) at least 30 min prior to the start of the surgical procedure. For post-operative care and management, inject the mouse with a subcutaneous injection of buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) for 3 days continuously, once every 8-12 h. Refer to the Table of Materials for all reagents and consumables used in this section.\nEuthanize the subcutaneous tumor-bearing mouse with an i.p. injection of pentobarbital (330 mg/kg). Make an incision on the skin of the tumor site using a scalpel blade. Excise the subcutaneous tumor block and transfer it immediately to the culture media. Perform this step as quickly as possible.\nCut the tumor block into 1 mm3 small tumor cubes using sharp surgical scissors. Keep all the tumor cubes in the culture media. Avoid using the core region of the subcutaneous tumor block.\nAnesthetize the mouse that will be undergoing the subsequent orthotopic tumor implantation surgery with an i.p. injection of a mixture of ketamine (87.5 mg/kg) and xylazine (12.5 mg/kg). Make sure that at least 30 min has elapsed after giving the buprenorphine prior to anesthetizing the mouse. Make sure to apply eye lubricant to the mouse to avoid drying and the potential formation of corneal ulcers.\nPlace the mouse in a supine position on a sterile pad that is on top of a pre-warmed heating pad. Monitor and record the physiological state of the mouse every 15 min until the end of the surgical procedure.",
    "Extend the limbs of the mouse. Secure them with tape to maximize exposure of the ventral abdomen and thorax. Sterilize the entire abdominal skin of the mouse with a 10% povidone-iodine solution, followed by 70% ethanol. Assess the anesthetic depth of the mouse by checking for no response to toe pinching-the pedal withdrawal reflex.\nPerform a laparotomy by making an approximately 10 mm midline incision to access the peritoneum using sharp scissors. Clamp and pull the xiphoid process toward the head with forceps and apply the subcostal retractors to open the surgical field. Make sure that a proper incision is made to enable a good surgical view of the operation site.\nRetract the median and left lobes upward with a wet gauze swab. Move the intestines outside the abdomen onto the left side of the mouse and cover them with a wet gauze swab. Perform hepatic artery ligation (HAL) on the common hepatic artery (CHA), which originates from the pancreatic head to its root in the hepatic pedicle, under a magnifying lamp for optimized visualization.\nRetract the median and left lobes back/downward with a wet gauze swab to expose the left lobe. Make an incision of roughly 2 mm in length and depth on the surface of the left lobe with a sterile scalpel blade.\n\tNOTE: It is also possible to use the median lobe of the liver for tumor implantation to minimize accidental tears or laceration by trauma to neighboring abdominal organs.",
    "Immediately insert a tumor fragment into the liver incision with sterile forceps. Bury the tumor so that it sits securely in the liver. Apply a figure-of-eight suture with a 6-0 nylon suture over the incision site to ensure proper tumor fragment implantation into the liver and hemostasis. Perform this operation as quickly as possible to avoid excessive bleeding. Upon completion, close the abdomen incision with interrupted 5-0 sutures.\nPlace the mouse back in the cage sitting on top of a pre-warmed heating pad to assist with recovery from anesthesia and to regain the righting reflex. Continue to monitor and record the physiological state of the mouse every 15 min until the mouse is fully awake and maintains sternal recumbency.\nRepeat the procedure until all mice have gone through orthotopic tumor implantation. Provide post-operative care to all mice by continuously monitoring their physiological state daily for the next 3 days after the surgical operation. Give buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) every 8-12 h.\n3. Setting up of PET/MR calibrations and workflow\nNOTE: Imaging is performed using a preclinical PET/MR 3T system (see Table of Materials).\nUse 5% isoflurane (1 L/min medical O2) to anesthetize the mouse in an induction chamber. For each scan, carefully place the anesthetized mouse on an imaging bed with continuous heating; first, scan with MR (scout view) as an anatomical reference for static [18F]FMISO or [18F]FDG PET scans, followed by anatomic reference MR imaging.\nCreate a sequential PET/MR imaging workflow in the software (see Table of Materials) to include a static PET scan, T1-weighted (attenuation correction) and T2-weighted (anatomic reference) MR imaging, and PET reconstruction 1 day before the scheduled imaging session.\nTo acquire PET, select 400-600 keV level discrimination, F-18 study isotope, 1-5 coincidence mode, and 20 min scans.",
    "To acquire whole-body T1-weighted MR, use gradient echo-3D with TE = 4.3 ms, TR = 16 ms, field of view (FOV) = 90 mm x 60 mm, number of excitations (NEX) = 3, 28 slices with 0.9 mm thickness, and voxel size = 0.375 mm3 x 0.375 mm3 x 0.9 mm3.\nTo acquire whole-body T2-weighted MR, use fast-spin echo 2D with TE = 71.8 ms, TR = 3000 ms, FOV = 90 mm x 60 mm, NEX = 5, 28 slices with 0.9 mm thickness, voxel size = 0.265 mm3 x 0.268 mm3 x 0.9 mm3.\nTo reconstruct PET, select Tera-Tomo (TT3D) algorithm, iterations = 8, subsets = 6, 1-3 coincidence mode, and with decay, dead-time, random, attenuation, and scatter corrections to create images with an overall voxel size of 0.3 mm3.\nPerform a PET activity test before the start of the experiment to check the accuracy of PET quantitation11.\n\t\nFill a 5 mL syringe with 5-8 MBq [18F]FMISO diluted in water or saline as per the manufacturer's recommendation. Use a dose calibrator to record the activity of the syringe (see Table of Materials). Note the time of measurement.\nDraw a volume of interest (VOI) on the reconstructed image to cover the whole syringe. Compare the recovered activity from the image to the value obtained from the dose calibrator. Proceed with imaging studies when the recovered activity is accurate within ±5%.\n4. [18F]FMISO and [18F]FDG injection\nObtain a clinical dose of [18F]FMISO from the supplier 30 min before the start of the imaging studies. Wear the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), such as a lab coat, gloves, over spectacles, a film badge, and ring dosimeters when handling radioactive materials. Change gloves frequently to avoid cross-contamination of the radioactive substances.",
    "Place the radioactive stock solutions in the lead storage container behind an L-block table-top shield. Dispense an aliquot of [18F]FMISO and dilute with sterilized saline. Ensure that the total activity concentration is 18-20 MBq in 100 μL.\nDraw up the [18F]FMISO with a 1 mL syringe with needle (see Table of Materials). Record the radioactivity and time shown on the dose calibrator.\nRecord the mouse weight before the injection of the radiotracer. Use 5% isoflurane (1 L/min medical O2) to anesthetize the mouse, then carefully inject the prepared [18F]FMISO via the tail vein. Record the injection time and residue activity of the syringe to account for decay correction. Place the mouse back in the cage for 180 min to allow [18F]FMISO uptake prior to the PET scan. Allow the mouse to recover for 1 day after [18F]FMISO PET.\n\tNOTE: Despite the very different in vivo pharmacokinetic profiles for [18F]FMISO and [18F]FDG, both radiotracers are radiolabeled with F-18, which is a PET radionuclide with a half-life of 109.77 min (< 2 h). Since the PET signal originates from F-18, half of the initial injected radioactivity will be lost every 2 h. In this case, the residual signal 24 h post injection can no longer be detected by the PET scanner. In addition, the 1 day gap between both [18F]FMISO (day 1) and [18F]FDG (day 3) injections will allow complete decay of [18F]FMISO when [18F]FDG PET is performed, hence no overlapping of [18F]FMISO signal in the [18F]FDG PET scan.\nRepeat steps 4.1.-4.4. for the [18F]FDG injection on day 3, with the exception that a total activity concentration of 6-8 MBq in 100 μL is injected with a 60 min uptake before the start of the PET scan.\nCalculate the injected [18F]FMISO or [18F]FDG activity using the following formula11:",
    "Injected activity (MBq) = Activity in the syringe before injection - Activity in the syringe after injection\n5. PET/MR acquisition\nTurn on the air heater to warm the mouse imaging bed before the scheduled PET scan. Use 5% isoflurane (1 L/min medical O2) to anesthetize the mouse in an induction chamber.\nOnce properly anesthetized and checked using the toe-pinch response, carefully and immediately transfer the mouse to the heating bed and maintain anesthesia at 2%-2.5% isoflurane. Place the mouse head-prone onto the bite bar and apply eye lubricant to both the eyes to avoid drying and the potential formation of corneal ulcers. Cover the imaging bed with a plastic sheet to maintain the bed's surrounding temperature.\nMonitor and record the respiratory rate and body temperature of the mouse using the in-house respiratory pad and thermal probe, respectively. Ensure that the mouse's body temperature is maintained at 37 °C while the respiratory rate is kept in the range of 40-50 breaths per min (bpm) by adjusting the isoflurane level.\nPerform a scout view to locate the mouse position inside the scanner. Adjust the mouse bed position to cover the whole mouse body, with the torso region located at the center FOV of the MR.\nTo start a PET scan, select PET Acquisition in the study list window, then choose Scan Range on Previous Acquisition to use the pre-determined mouse bed position from the scout view. Click on Prepare > OK to automatically move the mouse bed from MR to PET and start the acquisition.\nUnder the Radiopharmaceutical Editor, select the appropriate radionuclide, then enter the details of the injection dose and time before and after [18F]FMISO or [18F]FDG injection, as measured in step 4.3. and step 4.4. Enter the weight of the mouse under the Subject Information menu.",
    "Proceed with MR acquisitions upon completion of the PET scan. To do so, select Prepare to move the mouse to MR from PET. Click OK to continue.\nOnce all the scans are completed, select Home to move the imaging bed back to the default position.\nTurn off the anesthesia and flush the imaging bed with medical O2. Check the mouse pedal withdrawal reflex. Transfer the mouse from the imaging bed back to a clean housing cage placed on top of a heating pad to assist with recovery from anesthesia and to regain the righting reflex.\nUnder the Raw Scan, select PET Acquisition to load the acquired raw PET data for PET reconstruction. Select MM for use as a material map. Proceed with PET reconstruction using the parameter as described in step 3.6.\nStrictly adhere to the local and institutional guidelines when handling mice after PET imaging studies. Treat all used consumables, e.g., syringes, needles, gloves, wipes, and biological waste, e.g., cage bedding and fecal matter, that have been in direct contact with the mouse as radioactive waste, and handle with care according to the local regulations.\n6. PET image analysis\nOpen the Image Analysis software (see Table of Materials), and select Load DICOM Data to open the PET and MR images.\nDrag the corresponding PET and MR images to the software display window, and select Automatic Registration to perform automatic co-registration of the resulting PET and MR images.\n\t\nUnder the Registration Setup menu, select Rigid transformation. Use Shift and Rotation in the Rigid/Affine menu.\nUnder the Global Role Selection menu, click on MM as Reference and Static PET Scan as Reslice.\nInspect the co-registered PET/MR images to ensure proper alignment. If necessary, use Manual Registration to adjust the images manually.",
    "Locate the orthotopic tumor in the liver using the MR image. Use Interpolated Ellipse ROI to draw a VOI on the tumor, using the MR image for reference. Transfer the created tumor VOI from the MR to the PET image. Select the Brush Tool and Eraser Tool to carefully define the VOI border slide-by-slide. Make sure to avoid spillover of radioactivity uptake from the liver on the PET image.\nUse Ellipsoid VOI to create a 3 mm3 VOI on the liver as a reference organ. Make sure to avoid areas of visible hepatic vascular and biliary structures by using the MR image as a guide.\nSelect Show ROI Table to rename all the drawn VOIs. Record all the necessary data, e.g., radioactivity (kBq/mL) and tumor volume (mm3), in a spreadsheet. Save a copy of the VOI drawings and archive both the raw and reconstructed imaging data to an external hard drive when completed.\nCalculate the standardized uptake value (SUV) for all VOIs using the following equation11:\n\t\tSUV = CPET(t)/(ID/BW)\n\t\twhere CPET(t) is the measured activity in the VOI, ID is the injected dose measured in kBq, and BW is the mouse body weight in kg, assuming a tissue density of 1 g/mL.\nSubscription Required.
