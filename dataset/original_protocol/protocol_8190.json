    "The rodents were housed in an animal care facility and experiments were reviewed and approved by the Committee for Animal Welfare at the University of Bern, Switzerland (BE 108/16) and (BE65/16). All animals were maintained on a standard laboratory diet with free access to food and water. All animal experiments were conducted under careful consideration of the 3Rs (replacement, reduction and refinement). Ten female New Zealand White rabbits and 48 male Wistar rats were included. ARRIVE guidelines were followed strictly8.\nNOTE: Twenty sidewall aneurysms were created in 10 rabbits by suturing a decellularized arterial vessel pouch on the carotid artery of a donor rabbit. In addition, 48 microsurgical sidewall aneurysms were created in 48 rats as described before4,9. The imaging procedure and macroscopic analysis was performed 4 weeks after aneurysm creation.\n1. Preparation of material needed for fluorescein video angiography\nModify the flashlight by taping on a blue bandpass filter (see the Table of Materials), which will function as an excitation filter. The torch should then only emit blue light. Use black tape to avoid any leakage of unfiltered light.\nEquip the camera (e.g., attached to the microscope) with a green bandpass filter (see the Table of Materials), which will function as a emission light filter. Only green light should now be able to pass through.\n2. Preparation of workplace and materials\nDisinfectant the workspace with disinfectant solution.\nCover the table with sterile drapes to prevent contamination.\nUse sterile instruments for the surgery.\n3. Preparation of animals for the surgery\nWeigh the animals.\nInduce anaesthesia and adjust the dose according to the weight.\n\t\nFor rabbits, start balanced anesthesia. Shield their eyes with one hand during injection to reduce their fright reaction. Cover the cage with a sheet to help sedate the animals.",
    "Anesthetize rats in a gas chamber with 4% isoflurane and 96% oxygen prior to the injection.\nMonitor the depth of anaesthesia. Pinch between their toes to make sure the animals are asleep.\n\t\nReposition the rabbits onto their backs. They should not react.\nFor rats, pinch their tails and ensure that no reaction is observed.\nApply ointment on the rodents' eyes to prevent dryness. Pull out the rats' tongues to avoid any chance of swallowing.\nStart with preservation of anaesthesia.\n\t\nFor rabbits, catheterize (22 G shielded IV catheter with injection port, see the Table of Materials) the ear vein. Maintain balanced anaesthesia. Use a three-way stopcock to enable multiple simultaneous injections.\nFor rats, inject 50 mg/kg ketamine hydrochloride and 0.5 mg/kg medetomidine hydrochloride intraperitoneally. Monitor anaesthesia with a noxious toe pinch during surgery. In the case of reaction, administer additional anaesthetic.\nTape the animals onto the board in a supine position and closely shave the incision location. Disinfect the area with Betaseptic. \n\t\nFor rabbits, disinfect the neck, especially around sternocleidomastoid muscle.\nFor rats, disinfect the area from bladder to transvers colon.\nAdminister oxygen through a mask throughout the surgery and maintain body temperature with a heating pad.\n4. Preparation of the artery\nFor best results, thoroughly dissect the chosen vessel from the surrounding tissue9,10.\n\t\nFor rats, identify the tail vein (less invasive, preferably used for surviving animals) or dissect a femoral vein for fluorescein injection4,11.\n\t\tNOTE: For rabbits, no further dissection of vessels is needed for fluorescein injection as the ear vein is already being used for anaesthesia.\nPosition a white pad under chosen vessel to increase contrast with the surrounding tissue.\nFocus the camera mounted to the microscope on the dissected artery.\n5. Fluorescein video angiography",
    "Cover the 5 mL syringe filled with fluorescein sodium (100 mg/mL, see the Table of Materials) with aluminium foil to protect from exposure of light. Turn off the lights (as much as possible) and inject fluorescein sodium intravenously. Inject under darkness to prevent photobleaching.\n\t\nFor rabbits, inject 0.3 mL/kg fluorescein sodium through the three-way-stopcock into the catheterized ear vein.\nFor rats, inject 0.4 mL/kg fluorescein sodium into the femoral vein via a catheter or a 25 G needle.\nFlush the needle or the catheter with 0.5 mL saline solution to ensure that all dye is injected.\nIlluminate the surgical field with the modified flashlight.\nCommence filming with the modified camera. Blood flow should be visible a few seconds after injection (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: Here, we used frame rate = 50 frames/s, focal length = 70 mm, and F3.4.\n6. Macroscopic analysis\nResect the aneurysms and parent artery complex, and evaluate the patency macroscopically by opening the parent artery with micro-scissors and evaluate the lumen of the parent artery and the anerysm’s orifice (see Figure 1, 2)9. Measure the sizes of the aneurysms. Aneurysm-parent-artery-complex can then be stored for further analysis (e.g., histology).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
