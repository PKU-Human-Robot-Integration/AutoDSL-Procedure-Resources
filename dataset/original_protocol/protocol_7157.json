    "Cell preparationInoculate 1 mL of frozen M. mobile stock into 10 mL of Aluotto medium in a 25 cm2 tissue culture flask and statically cultivate it at 25°C for a few days, to reach an optical density at 600 nm of 0.06-0.08.Collect 2 mL of cultured cells by centrifugation at 12,000 × g and room temperature (RT) for 4 min, discard the supernatant, resuspend the cell pellet in 400 µL of PBS/G, and centrifuge it again at 12,000 × g and RT for 4 min (Note 1).Repeat this process twice.Resuspend the cells in 100 µL of PBS/G to 20-fold density of the original culture.Glass stage treatmentLightly press the substrate surface against the #3000 sandpaper and scrub 200 times back and forth to scratch the surface (The rough surface provides a more stable observation. This step is optional). Note that this process should not be applied to the other side.Put the glass stage into the 1.5 mL microtube filled with acetone and shake it to remove glass debris. (Optional: as mentioned above)To prepare saturated KOH-ethanol solution, add 10 g of KOH into 50 mL of ethanol, stir using a magnetic stirrer for 5 min, and transfer the supernatant of the saturated KOH-ethanol solution into a new beaker.Put several glass stages into the prepared saturated KOH-ethanol solution.Leave for 15 min to hydrophilize the glass surface.Discard the solution, add some deionized water, and shake the beaker gently.Repeat this process ten times to remove the chemicals.Move the glass stages onto Kimwipes and remove the water.Keep the glass stages with some slant in a heater, for 20 min at 40–45°C to dry.Cell immobilization on the glass surface.Treat the sides of the glass stage with Fluorosurf for hydrophobization.Note: If not treated, the liquid placed on the substrate surface will spill over to the sides.",
    "Fix the glass stage onto the Z-piezo of the HS-AFM scanner with nail polish (Figure 1).Just before use, dilute 1 µL of APTES with 999 µL of water.For silanization on the glass stage surface, load 5 µL of APTES solution onto the treated glass substrate immediately after the dilution and leave it for 10 min.Rinse the substrate surface with 20 µL of water dropwise. Repeat this four times (Figure 2).Replace the water on the glass substrate with 0.1% glutaraldehyde solution and leave for 5 min.Rinse the substrate surface with 20 µL of water dropwise. Repeat this four times.Replace the glutaraldehyde solution on the substrate with PBS/G.Replace the PBS/G on the substrate to cell suspension and leave for 10 min at 25–28°C.Rinse the substrate surface with 20 µL of PBS/G dropwise. Repeat this four times.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4344/bioprotoc-12-05-4344-g001.jpgFigure 1. HS-AFM scanner with glass stage and sample drop. Piezoelectric elements are used to drive each axis in the XYZ directions. Z piezo, glass stage, and sample solution are seen in a pink dashed circle, as illustrated in the lower right. The glass stage is fixed onto the Z-piezo using nail polish.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4344/bioprotoc-12-05-4344-g002.jpgFigure 2. Procedure for liquid replacement on the glass stage. Observation by HS-AFM.Set the HS-AFM scanner equipped with the glass stage and sample solution upside down to the HS-AFM mechanical unit and start imaging (Figure 3).Set the cantilever’s free oscillation amplitude (A0) and set-point amplitude (Asp) at ~2.5 nm and ~0.8 × A0, respectively. Under these conditions, the average tapping force <F> can be approximated as ~40 pN using the following equation:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20220302/20220302183540_5147.jpg where kc and Qc are the spring constant and the quality factor of the cantilever, respectively. The nominal values of kc and Qc in liquid are ~0.08 N/m and 1.5, respectively. The detail conditions were described previously (Uchihashi et al., 2012).",
    "For searching cells (Figure 4a), scan the sample at 150 × 150 pixels with an imaging rate of 1,000 ms per frame in an area of 3,000 × 3,000 nm2.(https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mBio.00040-21#movS1[href=https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mBio.00040-21]).To observe particle structure like Figure 4b, scan the cell surface with an imaging rate of 330 or 200 ms per frame in an area of 200 × 200 nm2, with 100 × 100 pixels.(https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mBio.00040-21#movS3[href=https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mBio.00040-21]).Other details are common with general observation of samples in solution using HS-AFM (Uchihashi et al., 2012).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4344/bioprotoc-12-05-4344-g003.jpgFigure 3.

The AFM unit (scanner and cantilever) is mounted on an inverted optical microscope which is placed on an anti-vibration table. (b) Schematic of experimental setup. Cantilever and M. mobile cells are not in scale. The optical view around the cantilever and the glass substrate can be observed through the monitor.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4344/bioprotoc-12-05-4344-g004.jpgFigure 4.
