    "All experimental procedures were performed at the Jikei University, Tokyo Japan. Animal handling and experimental procedures were approved by The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of The Jikei University (Approval no: 26-060) and performed in accordance with the Institutional guidelines for use of laboratory animals at the Jikei University, which agree with the Guidelines for Proper Conduct of Animal Experiments by the Science Council of Japan (2006). Animal care was conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, 1996).\n1. Preoperative Examination\nTake a cranial Computed Tomography (CT) scan of animals (common marmosets) in order to facilitate the identification of individual anatomical structures at least one month before surgery.\nCarry out an audiometric test at least one month before surgery.\n\tNOTE: Here, we used the ABR to assess hearing status. Briefly, a positive electrode was subcutaneously placed at the vertex and a reference negative electrode at the dorsal base of the stimulated ear. The ground electrode was subcutaneously placed at the dorsal part of the neck.17,18 ABRs were evoked with tone burst (1.0 ms tone burst duration with 0.1 ms rise and fall time). The sound level was then reduced in 10 dB steps from its maximum amplitude. At each sound level, 512 responses were averaged (with stimulus polarity alternated). ABR threshold was defined as the lowest sound pressure level (SPL) at which any wave could be detected.\n2. Anesthesia\nFast animals from the night before surgery under general anesthesia.\nAdminister 4% isoflurane and ambient air at 5 - 6 mL/min with mask-to-face ventilation or in an induction chamber for slow induction (Figure 1A). Confirm that the animal does not respond to painful stimuli, such as the toe pinch.",
    "Anesthestize common marmosets with intramuscular injection (into the femoral muscle) of a combination of medetomidine (0.04 mg/kg), midazolam (0.4 mg/kg), and butorphanol (0.4 mg/kg).\nInject ampicillin (0.08 mg/g) subcutaneously 30 min or more prior to skin incision as a preoperative antibiotic.\nPlace the marmoset in the supine position with its head toward the top, and extend the head and neck. Fix the maxilla to the table with a nylon thread, and pull up the tongue to obtain a good view, or use a laryngoscope to visualize the epiglottis and the entry of the larynx alternatively (Figure 1B).\nInsert an endotracheal tube along the laryngeal surface of the epiglottis.\n\tNOTE: It is possible to use a 16-gauge intravenous catheter, or 6-French gauge feeding tube, as an endotracheal tube (Figure 1C).\nCheck the EtCO2 from the endotracheal tube in order to confirm that it has been properly placed into the trachea. After the tube has been positioned and respiratory gas movement has been checked, fix the endotracheal tube to the marmoset's face with tape.\nMaintain anesthesia between 1-3% Isoflurane during the operation.\nMonitor the SpO2, EtCO2, body temperature and rectal temperature during operations. Perform all procedures on a heating mat to prevent a reduction in body temperature.\n3. Preoperative Preparation\nPrepare the marmoset in a supine position, and incline the head to a 30 - 45 degree angle to the non-operative side (Figure 2A).\nShave the post-auricular region of the operative side.\nDisinfect the surgical area with alcohol and povidone iodine, both in the post-auricular region and the external auditory canal.\nPlace a surgical drape sheet with a round hole onto the marmoset (Figure 2B).\n4. Surgical Procedures",
    "Inject 1% of lidocaine hydrochloride (with 1:100,000 epinephrine, 0.1-0.2 mL) subcutaneously into the skin incision site. Make an incision in the postauricular skin with a No.15 round-shaped blade.\nFor hemostasis, apply pressure to the bleeding area using a gauze soaked in 1:5,000 diluted epinephrine. Bipolar cauterization is also effective (Figure 2C).\nOpen up the soft tissue of the post-auricular region so that auricular cartilage (c) and post-auricular muscle (m) can be recognized. Expose the external auditory canal bone that should be visible deep in the cartilage (Figure 3A).\nTo confirm the depth of the tympanic membrane, expose the bony part of the tympanic rim which can be recognized as the adhesion of skin and bone in the deepest part of the posterior ear canal.\n\tNOTE: This step allows us to recognize how deep the lateral part of the middle ear cavity is (Figure 3A).\nPeel the post-auricular muscles (sternocleidomastoid muscle, splenius capitis muscle, and posterior belly of digastric muscle) toward the caudal aspect, separated from the temporal bone. Then expose the lateral surface of the temporal bone (asterisk in Figure 3B).\nMake a hole approximately 5 mm behind the external auditory canal with a 1.0 mm diamond bur. (Figure 3C). Use a drill speed of 1,000 - 8,000 rpm depending on the drilling site.\n\tNOTE: A slow speed is adequate for delicate manipulation near the semicircular canal or the facial nerve. Drip the saline in drilling site properly to prevent the thermal injury.\nEnlarge the hole by drilling and confirm the position of the horizontal semicircular canal (HSC), which bulges toward the mastoid cavity (Figure 3D).",
    "Confirm the position of the facial nerve whose vertical part runs anterior of HSC. Drill and remove all the bone septa, if they exist, to obtain a clear view of the facial recess, which is located at the center of the triangular area between the facial nerve and the chorda tympani.\nMake a small hole by drilling in between the vertical part of the facial nerve and the tympanic rim (asterisk in Figure 4A) with a 0.6 mm diameter diamond bur at 1,000 rpm.\nMove the bur parallel to the posterior canal wall to prevent damage to the facial nerve, which can be seen as a pink line through the thinned bone. Stop the drilling immediately before the nerve is exposed as a white line structure (Figure 4B).\nEnsure the round window niche can be visualized through the hole (Figure 4C). Then, administrate drugs into the niche with a 25-gauge or thinner needle. In order to retain drugs in the round window niche, place a viscous solution on the niche (Figure 4D).\nAfter confirming that hemostasis is securely controlled, close the layers (epidermal layer and dermal layer) with simple interrupted suture using 6-0 absorbent threads.\nFix gauze on the surgical wound and affix a bandage.\n5. Postoperative Care\nAdministrate atipamezole hydrochloride (0.15 mg/kg) intramuscularly into the femoral muscle to antagonize medetomidine.\nWhen spontaneous breathing starts, remove the endotracheal tube.\nMaintain the common marmoset in an intensive care unit at 30% O2, 29 ℃ until anesthesia wears off to complete arousal.\nConfirm that there are no findings suggestive of vestibular dysfunction such as nystagmus, and return the animal to the breeding cage.\nSubscription Required.
