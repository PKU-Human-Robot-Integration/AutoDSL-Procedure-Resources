    "NOTE: All experiments were carried out in accordance with the Canadian Council of Animal Care and were approved by the University of Calgary, Animal Care Ethics Committee.\n1. Breeding and Animal Preparation\nOrder pregnant rats from standard laboratory animal suppliers or breed pups in-house according to standard breeding protocols.\nHouse all animals with ad libitum access to food and water, in a temperature controlled rat housing room (21 °C), that is maintained on a 12:12 hr light:dark cycle.\nWhen pups reach postnatal day 21 (P21), wean pups from their mothers and house in same-sex groups of 3 or 4.\n2. Set-up of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) Apparatus\nPrior to commencement of procedure, mill weights to the desired mass (e.g. 150 g). Securely attach a metal loop to the top end of the weight allowing the fishing line to be fixed to the weight.\nScore tin foil with a sharp razor blade. Ensure that the scored tin foil supports the body weight of the rat but will not interfere with acceleration of the rat following head impact with the weight.\nTape the scored tin foil to the U-shaped stage made of clear plastic (38 x 27 x 27 cm3) that contains a collection sponge (38 x 25 x 15 cm3) (Figure 1), so that it is taut.\nPlace the U-shaped plastic stage in the correct position underneath the guide tube made of clear plastic.\nHold the plastic guide tube (2.2 cm diameter x 1.5 m) in place with a clamp stand and position the guide tube so that it is 3.5 cm above the scored tin foil.\nAttach the fishing line through the metal loop to the weight ensuring that the bottom of the weight freely hangs 2.5 cm above the scored tin foil.",
    "Securely attach the fishing line to the clamp stand.\n\tNOTE: Tethering the weight to the clamp stand at a height of 2.5 cm above the tin foil prevents re-hits while the rat is falling from the impact to the collection sponge).\nPull the weight up through the plastic guide tube with the fishing line and hold it in place with an allen key pin at 1.0 m.\n3. Induction of mTBI\nWhen rats reach P30 move cages into the procedural room.\nPlace rats in an isoflurane chamber and lightly anesthetize the rat until it is non-responsive to a paw or tail pinch.\nQuickly place the rat chest-down on the scored tin foil with its head directly in the path of the falling weight. See Figure 2. If the rat begins to move or wake-up before it can be placed on the scored tin foil, return to the isoflurane chamber until non-responsive to a paw or tail pinch and begin again.\nPull the Allen key pin, allowing the weight to fall vertically through the plastic guide tube and strike the rat on the head. The rat will rapidly undergo an 180° rotation and land in the supine position.\nImmediately remove the rat from the collection sponge and apply topical lidocaine to the rat’s head with a cotton tipped applicator.\nPlace the rat in the supine position in a clean cage that is heated by setting it upon a commercially available heating pad.\nUsing a stopwatch or digital timer acquire the “time-to-right”. Time-to-right is the time taken by the rat to wake from the anesthetic and flip from the supine position to the prone position or begin walking.\nReturn the rat to its home-cage after it has recovered normal behavior (grooming, walking, exploring, etc.).",
    "Repeat steps 3.2–3.8 for each additional rat requiring a mTBI.\nRepeat the procedure on the same rat at multiple time points for repetitive mTBI experiments.\n4. Induction of the Sham Injury\nLightly anesthetize the rat with isoflurane until it is non-responsive to a paw or tail pinch.\nQuickly place the rat chest-down on the scored tin foil with its head directly in the path of the falling weight.\nRemove the rat from the tin foil without pulling the allen key pin from the plastic guide tube and apply topical lidocaine to the head of the rat with a cotton tipped applicator.\nPlace the rat in the supine position in a clean cage that is heated by setting it upon a commercially available heating pad.\nUse a stopwatch or digital timer to acquire the “time-to-right”.\nReturn the rat to its home-cage after it has recovered normal behavior (grooming, walking, exploring, etc.).\n5. Verification of mTBI with the Beam Walking Test 8\n24 hr after the induction of the mTBI or sham injury return animals to the procedural room.\nTransfer the rats to a clean holding cage and place the rat’s home-cage at the narrower end of the 165 cm tapered beam such that the open-ended portion of the home-cage faces the narrower end of the beam.\n\tNOTE: The tapered beam is 165 cm long. The center platform of the beam has a width of 6 cm at the wide end and 1.75 cm at the narrow end. The center beam has ledges (2 cm wide and 2 cm below the center beam) that provide safety when the rat’s foot slips. Place foam padding below the beam to reduce risk of injury to rats that may fall off the beam during the test.",
    "Place a video camera at the wide end of the tapered beam and position/zoom the video camera to ensure that the investigator watching the video can clearly see the movements of the rat for the entire length of the tapered beam.\nPlace the rat at the wide end of the tapered beam and encourage it to walk across the beam to its home-cage. Once the rat crosses the tapered beam, leave the rat in its home-cage for at least 60 sec to reinforce the target location. This is Trial #1 and not included in the analysis.\nTurn the video camera on and allow the rat to complete the beam-walking task 4 additional times (maintaining the 60 sec reinforcement periods in the home cage). Once the rat has completed all trials, return the rat to its home-cage.\nTo score, record the number of hind leg foot-slips that occur and the time/duration to cross the beam, for each individual trial. Use this data to compute the average number of hind leg foot-slips and time to cross the beam for each rat."
