    "NOTE: All product information used for this work is presented in the Table of Materials.\n1. Collagen immobilization\nNOTE: Ensure each well in the microplate used during the binding assay has adjacent wells free to avoid cross-fluorescence. Carry out this part of the protocol on ice because collagen self-assembles at rising temperatures and pH levels. Perform this procedure in a tissue culture hood and under sterile conditions because the microplates are subsequently incubated in a tissue culture (TC) incubator.\nImmobilization of type I collagen on the 96-well microplates (Figure 2)\n\t​Day 1\nPrepare a silicone tray with ice. Place the vial containing type I collagen, the cold 10x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the microplates on ice, and spray everything with 70% ethanol. Place the material under the TC hood.\nNeutralize the collagen using equal volumes of type I collagen and 10x PBS (pH 7.4).\nInvert the solution a few times, ensuring that no bubbles form.\nAdd 100 µL of the neutralized collagen to every other well and every other row of the microplate, and incubate at 37 °C for 18-20 h to evaporate the collagen to dryness.\nDay 2\nWash the microplates with 100 µL of 1x PBS, pH 7.4, twice to remove any unbound collagen.\nTransfer the microplates into the incubator at 37 °C for another 2 h to dry before using them for further binding experiments.\nImmobilization of collagen type III on the 96-well microplates (Figure 3)\nDay 1\nPrepare a silicone tray with ice. Place the vial containing type III collagen, the cold 10x PBS, and the microplates on ice, and spray everything with 70% ethanol. Place the material under the TC hood.\nNeutralize the collagen using equal volumes of type III collagen and 10x PBS (pH 7.4).",
    "Add 70 µL of the neutralized collagen to every other well and every other row of the microplate, and incubate at 37 °C for 2 h by placing the microplate under the tissue culture hood to evaporate the collagen to dryness.\nDay 2\nWash the microplates with 70 µL of 1x PBS, pH 7.4, twice to remove any unbound collagen.\nTransfer the microplates to the incubator for 1 h at 37 °C, and then transfer the microplates to the bench, and allow 1 h to dry before using them in further binding experiments.\n2. Assessment of the stability of the immobilized collagen gels/films\nIncubation with PBS for 1 h\n\tNOTE: During the binding experiment, incubate the immobilized collagen with the compound of interest. It is important to investigate the stability of the resulting collagen gel or film. To do this, measure the stability of three conditions: no wash = measures the immobilized collagen directly after incubation; washing = measures the immobilized collagen after washing the plate twice with 100 µL of PBS; and 1 h PBS mimic & wash = measures the immobilized collagen after incubating for 1 h with PBS followed by two washes with PBS. Below, the PBS incubation method is explained.\n\t\nAdd 70 µL of PBS (1x) to each of the wells coated with collagen, and incubate the microplate at room temperature for 1 h.\nAspirate the excess liquid from each well using a pipette, and wash with PBS (1x) twice before carrying out the protein quantification assay described below.\nQuantification of the amount of immobilized collagen using a bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA)",
    "​NOTE: Use the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Table of Materials) following the manufacturer's instructions. Make respective collagen standards for this assay. The concentration range for collagen I is from 0-3,000 µg/mL and for collagen III from 0-750 µg/mL. In total, make 11 standards per collagen.\n\t\nPrepare the total volume of working reagent (WR) needed by following the manufacturer's instructions.\nAdd 25 µL of each of the collagen standard into the microplate wells (in duplicate). These solutions are used to draw the standard curve.\nAdd 200 µL of working reagent solution to each of the wells containing the standards and the wells coated with unknown concentrations of collagen.\nPlace the microplate on a plate shaker for 30 s. Cover the microplates, and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min.\nRemove the microplates, and allow to cool at room temperature. Measure the absorbance at 560 nm using a plate reader.\nPlot a calibration curve by plotting the A560 (AU) against the concentration (µg/mL) of the 11 standard solutions, and use the calibration curve to calculate the amount of collagen.\n3. Europium(III) TRF ligand binding assay (Figure 1)\nNOTE: The compound used is a candidate collagen-binding peptide (CBP) labeled with a single Eu(III)-DO3AAm complex, referred to as Eu(III)-DO3AAm-CBP (Figure 4).\nIncubation of the collagen-coated plates with the Eu(III)-DO3AAm-CBP compound\n\t\nPrepare solutions of the Eu(III)-DO3AAm-CBP compound with concentrations ranging between 0.1-15 µM (0.1 µM, 0.5 µM, 1 µM, 3 µM, 5 µM, 7 µM, 10 µM, and 15 µM) in 1x PBS.\nAdd 75 µL of each concentration of compound into the collagen-coated wells (Plate A). Perform the experiment in triplicate to calculate the amount of compound that binds to the collagen.",
    "Use a second uncoated plate (Plate B), and add 75 µL of each compound to the empty wells to calculate the non-specific binding of the compound to the plate. Use triplicates for each concentration.\nIncubate the microplates for 1 h at room temperature.\nUsing a pipette, aspirate and discard the excess solution from each well, and wash the wells with 1x PBS twice to remove excess, unbound compound. Perform this step using both the collagen-coated and uncoated microplates.\nTo a third uncoated plate (Plate C), add 10 µL of the same range of Eu(III)-DO3AAm-CBP concentrations (in duplicate). Use the fluorescence reading from the Eu(III)-DO3AAm-CBP in solution to make a calibration curve.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not wash or aspirate the solution from this plate.\nAcid extraction of Europium(III) and time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) readings\n\tNOTE: Please refer to the supplemental information about the preparation and calibration of the volumes of the acidic solution (AS) and the buffering solution (BS). The volumes of the AS and BS required to reproducibly achieve an optimal pH were 54 µL and 46 µL, respectively, in this work. Carry out the following operation on plate A, plate B, and plate C.\n\t\nAdd 54 µL of acidic solution (AS) to each well, and place the plate in the incubator at 37 °C for 90 min, covering the microplates with foil to avoid evaporation. The temperature and incubation time must be carefully controlled to achieve reproducible decomplexation.\nAdd 46 µL of buffering solution (BS) to each well, and gently shake the plate for 30 s.\nAdd 100 µL of enhancement solution (ES), and shake the plate for 30 s.\nWait for 30 min before reading the plate using a TRF plate reader. Use the parameters listed in Table 2.\n4. Data analysis",
    "Quantification of the concentration of collagen immobilized on the wells\n\t\nObtain the equation of the calibration curve of the A560 (AU) versus the concentration (µg/mL) of the 11 standard solutions.\n\t\t\nUse the absorbance readings acquired from the wells containing the collagen standards.\nTabulate the average values from the duplicate wells, and plot the mean absorbance against the known protein (collagen) concentrations (µg/mL) to obtain the equation for the standard curve.\nUse the absorbance values to calculate the mass (µg) and concentration (M) of immobilized collagen.\n\t\t\nCompute the average absorbance values across the three wells that contained immobilized collagen, and record the standard deviation.\nUse the standard curve equation obtained from the collagen standard curve (step 2.2.6) to convert the absorbance measured from the collagen-coated wells into concertation. From this, calculate the concentration of collagen that was immobilized within the experimental wells in µg/mL.\nConvert the concentration calculated in step 4.1.2.2 (µg/mL) first to grams/liter and then, based on the molecular weight of the collagen, into molar (M).\nFinally, calculate the mass of the collagen immobilized in each well by dividing the concentration by the volume of collagen added to the well (100 µL for type I collagen and 70 µL for type III collagen).\nCalculation of the dissociation constant (Kd) (Figure 4)\n\t\nExtract the fluorescence readings.\n\t\t\nExport the fluorescence readings from the plate reader to a spreadsheet.\n\t\t\tNOTE: In binding assays, it is important to account for the potential non-specific binding of a compound to the plastic surface of the plates.\nCalculate the mean values of triplicate measurements from each compound concentration for the three different plates: the specific binding readings from the coated wells (Plate A), the non-specific binding from the uncoated wells (Plate B) and the total Eu(III)-DO3AAm-CBP in solution in the uncoated wells (Plate C).",
    "Determine the fluorescence values for the bound compound by subtracting the fluorescence readings of the uncoated wells (Plate B) from that of the coated wells (Plate A).\n\t\t\tEquation 1: Determining the bound fluorescence17:\nBound fluorescnece = Specific (coated wells) - Unspecific (uncoated wells)\nGenerate a calibration curve using the readings from the Eu(III)-labeled compound in solution (Plate C). Plot the fluorescence readings obtained against the concentration of the Eu(III)-labeled compound. Perform a linear regression fit.\nConvert the fluorescence readings to concentrations.\n\t\t\nConvert the readings of the bound fluorescence (step 4.2.3) into concentration using the standard fluorescence curve from the data generated using the compound concentrations in solution (step 4.2.1.4).\n\t\t\tNOTE: When comparing the binding properties of one compound toward different target proteins that immobilize at different concentrations, the latter will need to be considered when calculating the amount of compound bound to the target (i.e., bound compound/protein).\nDivide the concentration of the bound compound by the concentration of the protein immobilized in the well.\n\t\t\tNOTE: For this calculation, use the concentration of immobilized collagen that was calculated after the wells were incubated with PBS for 1 h (so-called PBS mimic experiment; section 2.1 above). This is to account for potential losses of collagen during the incubation step and washing step that will not contribute to the final fluorescence signal.\nPlot the data using a scatter plot that has the concentrations of the compound on the x-axis (µM) and the bound compound/protein on the y-axis.\nObtain the Kd values.\n\t\t\nFit the data acquired in step 4.2.2.3 using two possible binding kinetic models: one-site binding and one-site binding with a hill slope. The equations for each model are shown in Figure 6.\nChoose the model that provides a non-ambiguous fit with the highest R-squared value when fitting the data.",
    "Exclude the outliers (s) for each set of fluorescence readings per concentration per plate.\nCalculate the final Kd value, and present the data as the mean ± standard deviation of independent experiments.\n\t\t\tNOTE: For robust results, perform triplicate measurements within each plate and at least three independent experiments with different microplates.\nCalculate the fractional occupancy (FO).\n\t\tNOTE: From Equation 2, the concentration of the target is unknown, and, therefore, by using algebra and the Kd, from Equation 3, a workable equation for calculating the fractional occupancy arises in the form of Equation 4.\n\t\tEquation 2: Definition of fractional occupancy17:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64720/64720eq2v3.jpg\n\t\tEquation 3: The dissociation constant, Kd, which is the concentration at which the compound occupies 50% of the target at equilibrium17:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64720/64720eq3v2.jpg\n\t\tEquation 4: Rearranged equation to calculate the FO equation17:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64720/64720eq4v2.jpg\nCalculate the FO using the independent Kd values obtained for each individual plate. Plot the results, mean, and standard deviations of the FO against the concentration of the compound.\nReport the FO with values ranging from 0 to 1 or as a percentage with values ranging from 0%-100%.\nSubscription Required.
