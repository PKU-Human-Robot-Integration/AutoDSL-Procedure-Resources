    "Plants are kept overnight in the dark for before gas-exchange measurements. The overnight dark-treatment lasts at least 14 h to ensure complete stomatal closure.Note: In our case, we keep the plant in the dark in the same experiment room as the gas-exchange system. Warm up and calibrate the Li-6400XT, following the official instruction manual https://www.licor.com/env/support/resources?p=6400XT[href=https://en.bio-protocol.org/CantOpen.aspx?wzid=2226&url=https://%77%77%77%2E%6C%69%63%6F%72%2E%63%6F%6D/env/support/resources?p=6400XT].Set the control for the fixed flow model, at 500 μmol sec-1. Important: For the standard chamber, a flow rate lower than 500 μmol sec-1 will cause insufficient gas circulation, especially when the leaf area is smaller than the chamber area (6 cm2). Adjust the desiccant to keep the reference relative humidity (RH_R) at about 65%. Note: In our case, a relative humidity lower than 60% will cause unstable stomatal conductance (low humidity stress).Set the reference CO2 at ambient CO2 concentration (400 μmol mol-1) using the CO2 mixer. Set leaf temperature at room temperature. Note: In our case, we set the leaf temperature at 24 °C.Important: Do not set the ‘block temperature’ (chamber temperature) to constant instead of the ‘leaf temperature’, because even when the ‘block temperature’ is stable the leaf temperature will still fluctuate. According to the equation for stomatal conductance (see the official instruction manual for the Li-6400XT), the leaf temperature is one of the key factors for calculating stomatal conductance. A stable leaf temperature makes the stomatal conductance value representative of stomatal transpiration. After these parameters become stable, match the system as described in the official instruction manual, then clamp the rice leaf in the center of the chamber (Figure 1B). After all the parameters have stabilized, match the system again.Note: Make sure the lower side of the leaf touches the temperature sensor (see Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170412/20170412224533_3699.jpgFigure 1.

Images of the red and red + blue light illumination system.Open a log file, name it, and add some necessary notes, such as the name of the researcher performing the measurement. Then, open Auto Program (see Figure 2), set the logging frequency (Log every_ _ secs), duration (Run for _ _ _ minutes), and match frequency (Match every _ _ _ minutes). Note: In our case, we set those parameters as shown in Figure 2 (right panel).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170412/20170412224644_0163.jpgFigure 2. Parameters of Auto Program. A. A picture of the content in the Auto Program. The highlight option ‘AutoLog’ is the program used in this measurement. B. A picture of the parameter settings on entering the ‘AutoLog’ program.Note: Data in steps 9 and 10 are recorded by Auto Program. First measure stomatal conductance under dark condition for 30 min, and then illuminate the leaf with 700 μmol m-2 sec-1 red light from the top of the chamber, until the stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate reach steady states (stable for at least 10 min). Note: In our case, it always takes more than 120 min to reach the steady state.Under the red light background, add a weak blue light (3 μmol m-2 sec-1) for 30 min and then turn the blue light off, keeping the leaf illuminated under red light for another 90 min or more. For images of red light and red + blue light illumination see Figures 1C and 1D.Close the Auto Program and the data log file.",
    "Open the chamber and measure the width of the leaf. Because the length of the chamber is 3 cm, the area of the leaf sample is equal to the leaf width x 3 cm.Transfer the data from equipment to computer. Open the data file (.xls) with Excel (Microsoft, USA). Change the default leaf area of 6 cm2 to the actual leaf area determined following step 12 (the data file is shown in Figure 3). The data sheet will recalculate the stomatal conductance and other parameters automatically with the new leaf area. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170412/20170412225009_1795.jpgFigure 3. Example of data in Excel: changing the data for leaf area in the Excel file. The highlighted column ‘Area’ shows the default leaf area (6 cm2) that should be changed to the actual leaf area following step 12."
