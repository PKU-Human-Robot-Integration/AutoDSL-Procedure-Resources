    "Prepare reagents and buffersNote: Calculate the required amount of MS medium and cordycepin before starting reagent preparation based on experimental settings. Approximately 50 ml MS medium is required to prepare one 150 mm plate. Each well of the six-well plate requires around 3 ml MS medium. At least two replicates should be included for each sample at each time point. Depending on the size of the seedlings, approximately 10 to 20 seedlings could fit into one well of the six-well plate.Prepare 1× MS agar medium plates using 150 mm Petri dishes as described in the ABRC Arabidopsis protocols (Rivero et al., 2014). Prepared plates can be wrapped up and stored at 4 °C for at least a month.Prepare 0.5× MS liquid growth medium by making a two-fold dilution of 1× MS medium. Do not add agar. Autoclaved medium can be stored at 4 °C for at least a month.Prepare seeds surface-sterilization solution: Use 50% household bleach with distilled water to make solutions with final concentration of 2.6 % w/v sodium hypochlorite, add Tween® 20 to a final concentration of 0.05%.Dissolve cordycepin in nuclease-free water to make 0.6 M stock concentration. Store 0.6 M cordycepin stock solution at -20 °C.Dilute qPCR primers to 100 μM in nuclease-free water. Store at -20 °C.Prepare plant materialsSterilize seeds in microcentrifuge tubes by soaking them in the surface-sterilization solution for 5 to 10 min. Remove all bleach by rinsing five to seven times with sterile distilled water (Rivero et al., 2014).The Arabidopsis seeds (control and mutant groups, as shown in Figure 1) are sown onto the 1× MS agar plates at a density of about one seed per 1 cm2, facilitating manipulation during subsequent seedling transfer.",
    "After cold stratification, the plates are placed vertically in the growth chamber, thus preventing growth of the root into the solid media. Grow Arabidopsis in sterile condition for approximately 12 days following the ABRC Arabidopsis protocols (Rivero et al., 2014).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200713/20200713071501_8216.jpgFigure 1. Work flow illustration of RNA stability measurements using RT-qPCR in Arabidopsis. Twelve-day-old Arabidopsis wild type and mutant whole seedlings were transferred from MS medium agar plates to six-well plates with 0.5× MS liquid medium and incubated overnight (Note: Only roots will be submerged in liquid MS). The next day, cordycepin was added to a final concentration of 0.6 mM and the seedlings were collected for RNA extraction at indicated time points after cordycepin treatment. RT-qPCR was then performed to determine RNA levels, and statistical analysis was used to determine the significant difference between wild type and mutant RNA stability.Note: Prolonged sterilization might kill some Arabidopsis mutants. Seedlings of Arabidopsis can also be grown in liquid medium following ABRC protocols (Rivero et al., 2014). If grown in six-well plate in liquid medium, skip Day 1 procedures and add cordycepin to six-well plate directly as described in Day 2 Step 1.Experimental proceduresDay 1Use sterilized forceps to transfer Arabidopsis whole seedlings to six-well plates with 3 ml 0.5× MS medium per well in tissue culture hood. Be careful not to damage the seedling roots during the transfer.Incubate the plates on a shaker at 120 rpm in an Arabidopsis growth room or chamber to equilibrate the seedlings overnight.Day 2Note: Read the RNA extraction kit, cDNA synthesis kit and qPCR kit complete protocols before starting the experiment if using those kits for the first time. Use RNaseZapTM (Invitrogen) or ELIMINase® (DeconLabs) to wipe and decontaminate all pipettes and workstations. Add cordycepin (Sigma-Aldrich) to a final concentration of 0.",
    "6 mM (1 to 1,000 dilution of 0.6 M stock), and treat for required lengths of time (e.g., 0 min, 30 min, 90 min, 150 min, 210 min, 270 min, as shown in Figure 1).Note: The longest treatment (e.g., 270 min in this experiment) can be performed first, and then add cordycepin based on required lengths of treatment time, and finally collect all samples at the same time (Figures 1 and 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200713/20200713071522_3073.jpgFigure 2. Schematic representation of cordycepin treatment time course analysisCollect seedlings and blot on KimwipesTM to remove excessive liquid.Immediately, freeze the seedlings in liquid nitrogen and grind to a fine powder. Transfer to a cooled, appropriately sized, tube and allow liquid nitrogen to evaporate without allowing the sample to thaw, and then add lysis buffer. Repeat for the remaining seedling samples. Proceed to the next step of RNA extraction as soon as possible following the RNA extraction kit protocol (see Reference 8).Perform RNA quality control: Use a Nanodrop or Qubit to determine the RNA sample purity and concentration.Perform cDNA synthesis following Bio-Rad iScriptTM cDNA Synthesis Kit protocol (see Reference 3), and qPCR following SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix protocol (see Reference 10).Note: Negative controls for reverse transcription are required to make sure all DNA are eliminated during RNA extraction. To set up negative controls, replace reverse transcriptase with nuclease-free water during the cDNA synthesis reactions. Include the negative control samples in the following qPCR analysis. qPCR reaction conditions will need to be optimized for different primers, targets or cDNA samples. The amount of the cDNA reaction that is recommended for downstream qPCR is one-tenth of the reaction volume, typically 1 μl for 10 μl reaction. Try to keep Ct values under 35, which indicates strong positive signals. Include at least two housekeeping controls for qPCR analysis.",
    "Because qPCR assay is highly sensitive to pipetting errors and variabilities, use multichannel pipettes and low-retention tips to setup qPCR reactions."
