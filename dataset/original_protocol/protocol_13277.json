    "This study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, Sichuan University. Permission was obtained from relevant local agencies before the experiment. Eight 8-10 week old male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, with an average weight of 200-250 g, were used for the present study. The animals were obtained from a commercial source (see Table of Materials). Food and water were provided ad libitum throughout the experimental period.\n1. Preoperative preparation for the generation of carbon-nanoparticle-assisted PTX rats\nAnesthetize the 8-10 week old rats using 2.0%-2.5% isoflurane inhalation, followed by an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of tribromoethanol at 10 mL/kg body weight. Guarantee a sufficient depth of anesthesia by testing the absence of the pupillary light reflex. Use vet ointment on the eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\n\t​NOTE: Rats that are 8-10 weeks old are recognized as adult rats. However, this modeling method can be used on rats as young as 7 days old.\nPrepare the anesthetized SD rats for surgery by shaving the fur of the ventral neck region in the supine position. Disinfect the operative area using povidone-iodine cotton balls (see Table of Materials).\nCover the animal with surgical drapes (see Table of Materials), and expose the surgical region, aiming to minimize microbial contamination.\n2. Parathyroidectomy (PTX)\nStart at the midpoint between the two ears, and cut a 2 cm incision longitudinally toward the tail using a surgical scalpel. Dissect the fascia and fat layer successively with sharp, curved, serrated forceps.\nSeparate the paratracheal muscles, and expose the trachea using relatively blunt forceps under a stereo microscope at 4x-5x magnification.\nLocate the left and right lobes of the butterfly-shaped thyroid glands by the side of the trachea.",
    "Inject 1 µL of the carbon nanoparticle suspension (see Table of Materials) beneath the membrane of the thyroid glands using a 10 µL syringe with a 30 G beveled needle. After 5 min, irrigate the operative region with saline to clean the extra carbon nanoparticle suspension covering the thyroid gland membrane.\n\tNOTE: The recommended injection point is the mesial portion of the thyroid gland lobe, which has fewer blood vessels. A carbon nanoparticle suspension is commonly used in thyroid surgery due to its ability to detect the lymph nodes. Staining the thyroid glands and leaving the parathyroid glands unstained eases the identification of the latter.\nCheck to ensure that the thyroid glands turn black while the parathyroid glands remain unstained in ~5 min. Observe the highlighted parathyroid glands under ordinary light using either the light of a stereo microscope or a table lamp.\n\tNOTE: Typically, rodents have two drop-shaped parathyroid glands located on the left and right surfaces of the thyroid glands. Occasionally, additional parathyroid glands may be located further away.\nPrecisely cut the unstained parathyroid glands with microsurgery forceps and scissors. Use sterile cotton balls for hemostasis or a gelatin sponge if there is more bleeding.\nClose the muscles, fat layers, and skin, layer by layer, with an interrupted horizontal mattress suture using 6-0 polyglactin 910 sutures (see Table of Materials).\nFor the sham group, perform all the steps of the preoperative preparation and PTX except step 2.6. Anesthetize the rats, and separate the tissues above the trachea. Locate the parathyroid glands but do not remove them. Conduct postoperative recovery and observation together with the rats of the PTX group.\n3. Postoperative recovery and observation",
    "After surgery, place the rats on a thermostatic electric blanket (37 °C) to maintain their body temperature. Inject buprenorphine hydrochloride 0.01 mg/kg subcutaneously (s.c) every 12 h as postoperative analgesia. Transfer the rats to a sterile cage when they begin to move and try to crawl. \nClosely observe the rats postoperatively for 2 h. Return the rats to the rearing room, observe them routinely, and record their state.\nDraw 10 µL of blood from the tail vein 7 days after the surgery. Measure the serum Ca2+, serum Pi, and serum PTH using appropriate commercial kits (see Table of Materials). A successful parathyroidectomy produces a reduced serum ionized Ca2+ level 2 SD lower than that of sham-operated rats (9.00 mmol/L, n = 16).\n\tNOTE: A statistics and graphing software (see Table of Materials) was used for the statistical analysis. A Student's t-test was used to compare the serum and urinary parameters between the sham and PTX groups. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Serum and urinary Ca2+ and Pi and serum urea and creatinine were measured with commercial kits according to the manufacturers' instructions (see Table of Materials). Serum C-telopeptide of type I collagen and osteocalcin were measured with commercially available ELISA kits (see Table of Materials).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
