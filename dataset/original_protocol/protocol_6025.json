    "Preparation of materialThis protocol was established for the lysis of either 8 larval body walls, 50 larval brains or 20 fly heads to a final volume of 500 μl. Larvae or flies expressing the dMetRSL262G cell-type specifically and that were fed with the non-canonical amino acid azidonorleucine (ANL), to enable its incorporation into proteins, are needed. A detailed protocol on cell-type specific metabolic labeling of proteins with ANL in Drosophila is available (Erdmann et al., 2017).Preparation of larval body wallsPrepare larval body walls in HL3 solution (see Recipes) as described above in the Procedure of Part I according to previously reported procedures by Brent et al. (2009) or Ramachandran and Budnik (2010). However, skip the final flattening necessary for FUNCAT and immunostaining (Step 1 in the Procedure of Part I). Cut the most anterior and posterior parts to remove the mouth hook and the posterior spiracles from the body wall.Take the remaining body wall using forceps and wipe it carefully over a tissue to remove excess HL3 solution.Transfer the body wall directly into a glass homogenizer containing 50 μl homogenization buffer (see Recipes) on ice and repeat dissections until 8 body walls per group are collected. Alternatively, larval body walls may be processed at a later time point. To do so, collect 8 body walls in 50 μl homogenization buffer in a 1.5 ml tube on ice, shock-freeze in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C until further processing. To continue, thaw frozen samples on ice before proceeding with Step B.Preparation of larval brainsPrepare larval brains in HL3 solution by opening the dorsal site of a Drosophila larva and remove the brains from the heads using forceps.",

To continue, thaw frozen samples on ice before proceeding with Step B. Preparation of fly headsAnesthetize flies with CO2.Cut off 20 fly heads using either a pair of small scissors or forceps and transfer them directly into a glass homogenizer containing 50 μl homogenization buffer (see Recipes) as shown in Video 2. Figure 3 shows the main dissection steps. Alternatively, fly heads walls may be processed at a later time point. To do so, collect heads in 50 μl homogenization buffer in a 1.5 ml tube on ice, shock-freeze in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C until further processing. To continue, thaw frozen samples on ice before proceeding with Step B.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Fly head dissection. First, a glass homogenizer containing 50 µl homogenization buffer is put on ice. Flies are anesthetized with CO2 in the vial for a few seconds. Once the flies are immobile, they are transferred to a PDMS dissection plate, which is placed on top of a cold plate. Using a pair of fine forceps the abdomen is hold, and the head is gently pinched off with a second pair of forceps or fine scissors. Finally, the head is directly transferred into the glass homogenizer containing homogenization buffer. Continue until a total of 20 dissected heads are collected in the homogenizer.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190113/20190113232821_6693.jpgFigure 3. Fly head dissection. A.",
    "Prepare a glass homogenizer containing 50 µl homogenization buffer, put it on ice. B. Anesthetize flies with CO2. C. Transfer anesthetized flies to a PDMS dissection plate, which is placed on top of a cold plate. D. Use fine forceps to keep hold of the abdomen and a second pair of forceps or fine scissor to gently pinch off/cut off the fly head. E. Transfer the head directly into the glass homogenizer containing homogenization buffer. Repeat steps (Figures 3D and 3E) for a total of 20 dissected heads.Protein extractionNote: If not stated otherwise all subsequent steps are performed on ice.Optionally (for frozen and stored material): Transfer the thawed samples into a glass homogenizer containing 50 μl homogenization buffer.Homogenize material with the homogenization pistil for 60-120 s or until the suspension is homogeneous and devoid of any debris on ice.Add 2.5 μl 20% SDS (see Recipes) and 1 μl Benzonase® and homogenize again.Spin the material down with a mini centrifuge to collect all of the samples at the bottom of the tube (approximately 2,000 x g for 5 s) at RT.Transfer the suspension into a 1.5 ml tube. Rinse the glass homogenizer with 50 μl homogenization buffer, spin the material down with the mini centrifuge (approximately 2,000 x g for 5 s) and transfer the suspension into the 1.5 ml tube from Step B5.Incubate suspension for 20 min at room temperature in an end over end mixer.Spin the material down with the mini centrifuge.Heat suspension for 7 min at 95 °C and subsequently cool it down on ice for 5 min.Add 5 μl 20% Triton® X-100 to the suspension and mix briefly using a vortex mixer. Note: Suspension should be cooled down completely; otherwise the proteins will denature when adding 20% Triton® X-100. Add 391.",
    "5 μl homogenization buffer to a final volume of approximately 500 μl.Incubate suspension for 1 h, at 4 °C in an end over end mixer.Centrifuge at 3,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and transfer supernatant (= protein lysate) into a new 1.5 ml tube sitting on ice.Click chemistryNote: This protocol was modified according to Dieterich et al. (2007). In contrast to the FUNCAT reaction reagent, the individual components of the click chemistry are directly added to the protein lysates.Weigh Cu(I)Br into several 2 ml tubes and calculate the amount of ultra-pure water needed to reach a concentration of 10 mg/ml for each tube. Do not dissolve the Cu(I)Br yet. One Cu(I)Br suspension can be used for two click reactions.Add 0.5 μl of 200 mM triazole-ligand (final concentration 200 µM) to the protein lysate and mix for 10 s using a vortex mixer at highest speed, 2,700 rpm.Add 0.5 μl of 25 mM Biotin-PEO3-alkyne tag (final concentration 25 µM) to the protein lysate and mix for 10 s using a vortex mixer at highest speed, 2,700 rpm. Add the appropriate amount of ultra-pure water to your Cu(I)Br (10 mg/ml) and mix for 10 s using a vortex mixer at highest speed, 2,700 rpm.Add 10 μl of the 10 mg/ml Cu(I)Br suspension (final concentration 0.5 mg/ml) to your protein lysate and mix for 30 s using a vortex mixer at highest speed, 2,700 rpm. Incubate the reaction mix overnight at 4 °C in an end over end mixer.Centrifuge the reaction mix at 3,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Note: The Cu(I)Br and remaining triazole-ligand will precipitate at the bottom of the tube. Transfer the supernatant into a new 1.5 ml tube.DesaltingNote: All subsequent steps are performed on ice.",
    "Remove the bottom’s closure from the desalting column, loose cap and place the column in a 15 ml centrifuge tube.Centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 2 min at 4 °C.Discard the flow-through after each centrifugation step of the washing procedure.Add 1 ml of PBS-SDS pH 7.8 (see Recipes) to the column.Centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 2 min at 4 °C.Repeat Steps D4 and D5 twice. Place the column in a new 15 ml centrifuge tube and add the clicked protein lysate to the column.Centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 2 min at 4 °C.Discard the column and add 20 μl of 50x PI w/o EDTA (see Recipes; final concentration 2x PI w/o EDTA) to your clicked and desalted protein lysate sample.Adjustment of protein concentrationsWe use a standard amido black assay as described in Dieterich et al. (2006) to determine the protein concentrations of the samples and adjust the concentration of all samples to the concentration of the sample replicate that has the lowest amount of protein with PBS-SDS pH 7.8 + 2x PI. This adjustment improves the quality of the subsequent electrophoresis. We control the adjustment with standard silver gel staining. Other methods for the measurement of detergent-containing protein samples and subsequent adjustment are just as suitable.NeutrAvidin purificationThe appropriate amount of NeutrAvidinTM agarose depends on the concentration of ANL-labeled protein in your sample. If you observe a strong biotin signal in the unbound fraction of your processed samples, increase the amount of NeutrAvidinTM agarose accordingly. As a starting point, you may use 100 µl NeutrAvidinTM agarose suspension for ANL-tagged proteins from a pan-neuronal driver line and 150 µl suspension for ANL- labeled glial or muscle protein. Gently stir the NeutrAvidinTM agarose suspension several times until the beads at the bottom are mixed uniformly within the storage buffer.",
    "Transfer the appropriate amount of NeutrAvidinTM agarose suspension using a cropped pipette tip into a 1.5 ml tube.Equilibrate the NeutrAvidinTM agaroseAdd 1 ml PBS-Igepal-630 (see Recipes) and invert the tube several times.Centrifuge at 3,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Discard the supernatant carefully either with a pipette or a syringe.Repeat Steps F3a-F3c twice.Simultaneously incubate the desalted, clicked protein lysate with Igepal-630 (final Igepal-630 concentration in the sample: 1%) for at least 20 min at 4 °C in an end over end mixer.Transfer 20-40 μl of the protein lysate to a new 1.5 ml tube (= input fraction) for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses, prepare the samples for SDS-PAGE as is custom in your lab and freeze the sample at -20 °C. Add the protein lysate to the equilibrated NeutrAvidinTM agarose and incubate the mixture overnight at 4 °C in an end over end mixer.Centrifuge at 3,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Transfer supernatant into a 1.5 ml tube (= unbound fraction). For SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses, transfer 20-40 μl to a new 1.5 ml tube and prepare the samples for SDS-PAGE as is custom in your lab. Freeze the sample at -20 °C.Wash NeutrAvidinTM agaroseAdd 1 ml PBS-Igepal-630.Incubate NeutrAvidinTM agarose for 5 min at RT in an end over end mixer.Centrifuge at 3,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Discard supernatant.Repeat Steps F9a-F9d another 4 times.Add 1 ml 1x PBS pH 7.8 to the NeutrAvidinTM agarose.Incubate NeutrAvidinTM agarose for 5 min at RT in an end over end mixer.Centrifuge at 3,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Discard supernatant.Repeat Steps F9f-F9i twice.Elution of ANL-labeled biotin-tagged proteinsAdd 2x SDS elution buffer (see Recipes) to the tube containing the washed NeutrAvidinTM agarose.",
    "Rule of thumb: the volume of the elution buffer should be ½ of the NeutrAvidinTM agarose suspension volume (that is, when you used 100 μl NeutrAvidinTM agarose suspension, use 50 μl elution buffer). Heat your samples at 95 °C for 7 min.Cool samples down on ice for 5 min.Centrifuge at 3,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Transfer supernatant into a new 1.5 ml tube (= eluate fraction).SDS-PAGE and Western blotUse a standard protocol for SDS-PAGE and Western blot. We use 5-20% PAA, Tris-glycine gradient gels in a Hoefer Mighty Small System SE250 (Amersham Biosciences) with a constant current of 10 mA per gel. Separation of proteins is stopped once the bromophenol blue front leaves the separating gel. Proteins are subsequently transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (e.g., Protran BA85, 0.45 µm, Whatman) at 200 mA for 1.5 h. For the detection of ANL-labeled and biotin-tagged proteins use an anti-biotin antibody (e.g., rabbit-anti-biotin antibody, Bethyl Laboratories, catalog number: A150-109A). For the detection of cell-type specific candidate proteins use specific antibodies such as an anti-Dlg antibody (DSHB, USA, antibody ID 4F3 anti-discs large) for the detection of the scaffold protein Discs Large after muscular ANL-labeling, an anti-Draper antibody (DSHB, USA, antibody ID Draper 8A1) for the detection of the glial engulfment receptor Draper after glia-specific ANL-labeling or an anti-synapsin antibody (DSHB, USA, antibody ID 3C11 [anti SYNORF1]) for the detection of a synaptic protein after neuronal ANL-labeling. A sample Western blot is shown in Figure 4 depicting biotinylated ANL-harboring proteins as well as de novo synthesized synapsin in neurons.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190113/20190113232844_3310.jpgFigure 4. Western blot protein visualization and identification after chronic ANL incorporation into neuronal protein and bio-orthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT).",
    "Heads from adult flies (a) chronically exposed to ANL and (b) expressing the dMetRSL262G pan-neuronally (elavC155-Gal4, UAS-dMetRSL262G-EGFP, see our detailed bio-protocol on cell-type specific metabolic labeling of proteins with azidonorleucine in Drosophila [Erdmann et al., 2017]) were lysed (see ‘protein extraction’, Part II B), the ANL incorporated in the proteins was clicked to a biotin tag (see ‘click chemistry’, Part II C) and desalted (see ‘desalting’, Part II D). The protein concentration was normalized (see ‘adjustment of protein concentrations’, Part II E) before NeutrAvidin purification (Part II F). The representative Western blot shows the input fraction (lysate before NeutrAvidin purification), the unbound fraction (no ANL-containing proteins), and the eluate fraction (enriched ANL-labeled proteins after NeutrAvidin purification) at the global protein level (anti-biotin antibody) and for a selected candidate neuronal protein (anti-synapsin antibody). The input fraction contains all protein, that is, biotinylated and non-biotinylated protein. Therefore, the biotin signal of samples from flies exposed to ANL is diluted to approximately 1:10 depending on the respective protein compared to the same sample after NeutrAvidin purification (eluate fraction). Note that no biotin signal is observed in samples from flies not exposed to ANL, demonstrating a proper signal-to-noise ratio of the purification step. Similarly, no biotin signal is observed in the unbound fraction, demonstrating an appropriate amount of NeutrAvidinTM agarose. The relatively high synapsin signal in the unbound fraction shows that not all synapsin is biotinylated, thus that not all synapsin has ANL incorporated. This result is explained by the relatively non-invasive nature of our technique as the endogenous MetRS is not knocked out and loading methionine onto the Met-tRNA and consequently methionine into elongating polypeptide chains at the ribosome."
