    "1. Calibrate the Spring Constant of Cantilever\nLoad the cantilever into the AFM according to the manufacturer's instructions. It is necessary to clean the cantilever holder with ethanol before any experiments. This will help limit bacterial contamination to culture during the AFM measurements.\nCalibrate InvOLS (Inverse Optical Lever Sensitivity). This parameter describes the amount of photodiode response (Volts) per nanometer of cantilever deflection.\nLoad a clean glass slide onto the sample stage, then install the AFM head and adjust the laser beam and alignment according to the manufacturer's instructions. Engage the AFM tip on the glass slide.\nWith the piezo withdrawn, realign the mirror to a photodiode reading of -2 V. Perform a force spectroscopy measurement with a trigger point (maximum photodiode response) of +2 V.\nWith the piezo withdrawn, realign the mirror to a photodiode reading of -2 V. Perform a force spectroscopy measurement with a trigger point (maximum photodiode response) of +2 V. Note: The voltage values here are specific to the Asylum AFM. This value should be set according to the specifications provided by manufacturer.\n\tAfter data acquisition is complete, zoom in to the firm-contact region of the force curve. Perform a linear fit to this region to find the slope, which will be in V/nm. The reciprocal of this value describes the optical sensitivity of the cantilever-photodiode ensemble.\nReset the mirror alignment to a free deflection of 0 V.\nCalibrate the cantilever spring constant. A thermal-tune method is used to determine the spring constant of the cantilever 28.\nAfter calibrating the InvOLS, raise the scanner away from the sample stage such that there are no interactions between the tip and sample.",
    "Begin capturing thermal data. During this process, the thermal vibration of the cantilever beam is recorded. The AFM software analyzes a power spectrum of such a thermal vibration and plots it in a data window.\nAfter a few seconds of data acquisition, perform a fit to the data segment centered at the lowest-frequency (fundamental resonance) peak to determine the spring constant.\n2. Loading the Sample\nInstall the Dish Heater accessory on the AFM stage, if not already equipped.\nSet the temperature to 37 °C, and wait for 20 min for the system to reach a stable thermal equilibrium.\nPlace the culture dish on the AFM stage and secure it using the clamp provided with the dish heater. It is important to minimize the time between removal of the dish from the incubator and placing it on the stage, to avoid trauma to the cells. For measurements longer than 30 min, CO2 independent medium should be used to replace the normal culture medium.\nApply a small drop of 37 °C culture medium to the tip of the AFM cantilever, and lower the AFM head until the tip is just submerged in liquid.\nUsing the top-view CCD camera, realign the laser beam on the cantilever (the alignment in liquid will be different than in air, because of the change in refractive index of the medium).\nEngage the AFM tip on a clean area of the culture dish.\nPerform calibration of the InvOLS as described above, for the cantilever sensitivity in the liquid environment.",
    "Note: a) If cells are cultured on hydrogels, the calibration of InvOLS should be performed in advance against the bottom surface of a culture dish filled with cell culture media. When switching to cell samples, special attention has to be paid to not change the laser beam alignment with the cantilever. b) InvOLS has to be recalibrated whenever there is a change in the laser alignment. c) It is also recommended to take InvOLS as the average of value from several calibration curves, since each calibration generates a different InvOLS. The variation in InvOLS is, however, small comparing to the mean value. For example, calibrating an Bruker DNP-10 cantilever with spring constant 0.06 N/m in liquid by 100 times produce a mean InvOLS value of 66.3 nm/V, with standard deviation of only 0.5 nm/V.\n3. Collecting Force Curves of Cell Indentation\nSelect a cell for indentation. With the aid of the optical microscope, move the stage to position the cantilever above the cell so that the tip is located in the peri-nuclei region. Precise adjustment of the cantilever position may be accomplished by applying offsets to the X and Y scanners.\nNote: The AFM cantilever has to be withdrawn from the sample surface while moving the sample stage to select a target cell. This protects the cantilever from knocking into the sample, since the sample surface may not be flat.\nSwitch to Force Spectroscopy mode. Set the Indentation rate to within the range of 1-10 μm/sec, low enough to avoid hydrodynamic effects.",
    "Set the deflection trigger point, which limits the maximum indenting force to avoid damage to cells. Select the Relative triggering option, which will correct for any drift in the deflection signal. A maximum force of 2 nN is a good starting point for most samples. This value, however, should be adjusted according to the sample stiffness. For soft samples a lower value should be used to avoid excessive indentation to the sample. For stiff samples a high value should be used to generate measurable indentation.\nSet the force distance large enough to ensure that the tip will be fully detached from the cell between force measurements. Usually, the force distance is set at 5 μm.\nCommand the AFM to take a single force curve.\nCollect at least three force curves at different locations in the peri-nuclei region of each cell. Although it is beneficial to take multiple curves on each cell for reliable statistical data, taking too many force curves can lead to changes in cell stiffness due to stress from the AFM probe.\nWhen data collection is complete, withdraw the tip, and repeat steps 3.1-3.6 for as many cells as needed for good statistical data on cell stiffness under a certain sample condition. Usually, 30 cells are measured for each condition.\nTo characterize the distribution of stiffness within a single cell, force-map mode is applied. In the Force-map mode, set a scan size to include the region of interest; set an appropriate resolution; set the indentation parameters as those selected for single force curves; the AFM will then raster across the defined sample area and take single force curves at each pixel in the sample region.\n4. Data Analysis",
    "The recorded force curves are analyzed using a custom MATLAB procedure to calculate the cell stiffness. The following is a brief description of MATLAB procedure:\nThe MATLAB program identifies the contact point coordinates z0 and d0 (see Figure 1) using an algorithm adopted from a published method by Lin et al. 29:\nFor each data point in the force curve, perform a linear fit of the data to the left of the point of interest, and a Hertz model fit to the right (using the selected point as the initial point of contact), up to the set maximum indentation (200-300 nm recommended).\nFor each point, calculate the relative RMS error of both fits and sum these values.\nThe point which attains the minimum total fitting error is selected as the initial point of contact.\nNote: Computation time can be reduced by implementing a golden-section search rather than linearly scanning the entire force curve.\nSample deformation δ and indenting force F are calculated as:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50497/50497eq1.jpg\nA least squares fitting is applied to fit the F vs. δ data in the post-contact region, z  ≥  z0 , to the Hertz model to extract the Young's modulus, E of the cell:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50497/50497eq2.jpg\n\t, where v is the Poisson's ratio.\nNote: When δ is more than 10% of the sample thickness (cell height), the measured cell stiffness is affected by the substrate stiffness. The thickness of peri-nuclear region is usually on the order of a few micrometers. Therefore, only the first 200-300 nm of F-δ curve is fit to the Hertz model.\nSubscription Required.
