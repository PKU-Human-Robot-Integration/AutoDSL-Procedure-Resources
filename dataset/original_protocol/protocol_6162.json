    "Excisional skin wounds in rats (Figure 1)Anesthetize the animal with an intramuscular injection with a mixture of ketamine and xylazine (20 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg, respectively) or following the requirements from the local ethics committee.Shave the dorsal region and gently remove two fragments from the skin using an 8 mm diameter circular biopsy punch (the distance between wounds should be approximately 1.5 cm).Note: This procedure should be handled carefully to not damage the muscular layer below the skin. Measure the wound area immediately using a digital caliper and repeat the procedure on Days 3, 7, 14 and 21 after wound creation.Note: This time-course corresponds virtually with phases of skin healing processes. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190701/20190701010903_5478.jpgFigure 1.

Wound area measurement using a digital caliper. Histological evaluation of woundsEuthanize the animals on Days 3, 7, 14 and 21 after wound creation. This procedure must be in agreement with protocols approved by the local ethical committee.Collect the skin fragments using a 10 mm punch. It should cover the entire wound area.Immediately fix the skin fragments in 10% buffered formaldehyde. After 6 h in fixation solution, cleaves the tissues in half using a razor and keep the tissues in fixation solution for 24 h. It is crucial to establish the cleave orientation for all wounds (craniocaudal or later-lateral direction), as showing in Figure 2.Note: For longer-term storage, after 24 h transfer the fragments to 70% ethanol. Use routine procedures for processing paraffin embedding tissues (dehydration, clearing and wax infiltration).",

    "The morphological analyses are performed on new tissue in formation and, at later time-points, on the formed cicatricial tissue. Six fields per slice should be evaluated to encompass the borders (area of boundary between the intact connective tissue and the one in formation) and the center of the wound or the scar. For each parameter, five slices are analyzed. The qualitative histology studies should be performed by analyzing the stained tissues using a specific score for each parameter, according to described below:InflammationEvaluate the cellular infiltration (polymorphonuclear and mononuclear) in HE-stained sections using the 10x objective (Table 1 and Figure 4).Table 1.
