  "title": "Elevated Plus Maze Test to Assess Anxiety-like Behavior in the Mouse",
  "procedures": [
    "The maze should be assembled in an isolated room away from any extraneous interference of noises, scents or movement. You may choose to place a source of low-intensity white noise in the behavioral experiment room. It should be noted that guidance cues, such as drawings on the walls around the room might skew the animalâ€™s activity to a certain area of the maze. Therefore, any sort of paintings or artifacts that may serve as cues must be removed.   The experimenter must restraint from making any excessive noise or movement during the entire trial and from wearing perfumes, colognes or any product with a strong smell, since it could act as anxiogenic stimulus for mice.    Illumination in the room must be measured with the aid of a lux meter, kept constant and controlled according to the analysis that is to be performed. Given that low-intensity luminosity reduces open arm avoidance (Morato and Castrechini, 1989; Bertoglio and Carobrez, 2002; Cosquer et al., 2005; Pereira et al., 2005), to analyze an anxiogenic effect low-intensity lighting (5-30 Lux) should be preferred, whereas an anxiolytic effect should be analyzed under higher intensity lighting (200-400 Lux or more).   After these experimental conditions are adjusted to a standard, the animals will be brought into the experiment room, where they will be left in their home cages for 45 to 60 min in order to recover from the stress of being moved.   Clean the maze with 70% ethanol before starting the test in order to remove any dirt or smells accumulated on the apparatus.   Turn on the video camera and place the first mouse in the center square of the maze facing one of the open arms, preferably the one opposite to the experimenter.",
    "The experimenter will stand as far away as possible from the maze and out of sight of the test animal, outside of the room if necessary. He must also avoid making unnecessary movement or sounds.   After 5 min of free exploration, the mouse may be moved out of the maze and back into its home cage.   All the urine and fecal boli must be removed and the maze cleaned entirely with 70% ethanol to remove any residual smell from the first mouse. Afterwards, the next mouse may be submitted to the test.   Repeat steps 6-9 until all the animals have been tested.   The recorded videos can be analyzed by automated computer software or manually with the aid of a chronometer. Several parameters can be considered:   Entries in closed arms and time spent in closed arms: Measures of total locomotion on the maze throughout the experiment (Carola et al., 2002; Walf and Frye, 2007).   Entries in open arms and time spent in open arms: May be used as inverse measures of anxiety, that is to say, reduced open arm avoidance reflects lower levels of anxiety (Carola et al., 2002; Walf and Frye, 2007; Griebel et al., 1993).   Risk-assessment behavior: the frequency and the duration of head-dipping (downward movement of the head towards the floor while on the open arms) and stretch-attend posture (stretched posture with the head and two or three paws on the open arm and retraction to previous position) can be a direct measure of anxiety, i.e. increased risk-assessment behavior indicates higher levels of anxiety (Carola et al., 2002; Weiss et al., 1998; Carobrez and Bertoglio, 2005).     Statistical analysis: Parameters should be examined separately by analysis of variance across all treatment schedules. The data can be further analyzed by a post-hoc test, if applicable."
