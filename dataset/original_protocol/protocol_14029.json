    "This protocol focuses on the reconstruction phase of PD using mSLR and follows the guidelines of the ethics committee of the Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany.\nNOTE: Patients with a resectable tumor of the pancreatic head, the papillary region or severe refractory chronic calcifying pancreatitis underwent PD. Resectability was present if the tumor had less than 50 % contact to the peripancreatic arteries and did not infiltrate the portal vein or the superior mesenteric vein. Distant metastases in cases of adenocarcinomas were also contraindications for PD. The resection technique in PD is standardized and described in detail elsewhere11,12. It does not affect the type of reconstruction itself.\n1. Patient preparation\nAfter the patient has been brought to the operation theatre by the nurses, have the anesthesiologist start the anesthesia. Monitor the depth of anesthesia throughout the operation by the anesthesiologist including continuous check of the vital signs.\n2. Establishing the indication for mSLR\nConfirm the indication for a mSLR after the resection phase in PD. Construct a mSLR in cases of a high-risk pancreatic remnant characterized by soft and fragile pancreatic tissue and/or a tiny main pancreatic duct with a diameter of 1-2 mm.\nPalpate the pancreas to determine subjectively whether the pancreatic texture is soft or hard. Use a Shore durometer to measure the pancreatic texture. Shore units < 40 are characteristic for soft pancreata.\n3. Reconstruction phase: mobilization of the jejunal loop\nResect the first 10 inches of the jejunum to provide enough length of the mesentery. The jejunum follows the duodenum and begins after the ligament of Treitz.\nAdvance the loop into the right upper abdominal quadrant through a wide slit in the transverse mesocolon distal to the right colic artery.\nClose the slit with an interrupted polypropylene 4 – 0 suture.",
    "Oversew the stapled line with a continuous PDS 5-0 suture.\n4. Reconstruction phase: pancreaticojejunostomy\nPosition the jejunal loop as demonstrated in Figure 1 (“modified single-loop reconstruction”) to construct an end-to-side pancreaticojejunostomy.\nCreate a double-layer, end-to-side, duct-to-mucosa PJ using an interrupted polydioxanone (PDS) 5-0 suture for the outer layer and interrupted polypropylene 5-0 suture for the inner layer.\nUse interrupted sutures between the pancreatic duct and the jejunal mucosa for the inner layer. Construct the outer layer with single sutures between the pancreatic parenchyma/capsule and the seromuscular layer of the jejunal loop.\n5. Preparation of the long jejunal limb and jejunojejunostomy\nChoose a jejunal segment between the PJ and HJ (which will be constructed afterwards), which measures 25–35 cm instead of 10 cm as in conventional single-loop reconstruction. Create the jejuno-jejunostomy before or after construction of the HJ.\nNow construct an additional side-to-side jejunojejunal anastomosis at the lowest point between the afferent and efferent limbs of the HJ. Begin by placing marking sutures at the sites of the jejuno-jejunostomy with single PDS 5-0 stitches.\nPerform the intestinal anastomosis in a continuous double-layer PDS 5-0 suture technique. Construct the outer layer of the backwall with a continuous seromuscular suture. Perform the inner layer of the backwall with a continuous suture with stitching of all jejunal layers on both sides. Construct the inner layer and the outer layer of the front wall in the same way.\nEnsure that the anastomosis is sufficiently wide – about 1 inch. This allows good flow of bile and pancreatic secretions even in the early postoperative period when themucosa is edematous and may obstruct a narrow anastomosis. Close the slit around the jejunal loop using interrupted polypropylene 5-0 sutures.\n6. Reconstruction phase: hepaticojejunostomy",
    "Use a single-layer interrupted or continuous PDS 5-0 suture for construction of the HJ. Use interrupted sutures especially for tiny ducts. Ensure that the stitches enclose all jejunal layers and all layers of the common bile duct.\nSplint thin-walled and tiny common bile ducts with an externally diverted T-tube.\n7. Reconstruction phase: duodenojejunostomy\nReconstruct the intestinal passage with an end-to-side, double-layer duodeno(pyloro-)jejunostomy using continuous PDS 4-0 sutures.\nConstruct continuous seromusculary sutures for the outer layer of the back- and front wall as described in step 5.3. Use continuous sutures with stitching of all duodenojejunal layers for the inner layers of the anastomosis.\n8. Management of drainages, postoperative medical treatment and POPF - monitoring\nAt the end of the surgery, place 2 intraabdominal soft silicone drains in the vicinity of the HJ and PJ. Channel them separately through the skin of the right and left middle abdomen.\nApply subcutaneous octreotide 100 µg three times a day for 7 days after surgery. Use pasireotide as an alternative.\nDetermine pancreatic amylase and lipase activity in the drain fluid every 48 h beginning on postoperative day 3.\nDischarge the patient once they have recovered from surgery – usually around postoperative day 21. Ensure that the drainages have been removed, the patient is fully mobile and able to eat regularly.\nPerform follow-up investigations including computed-tomography of the abdomen, magnet-resonance-cholangiopancreatography and esophagogastroscopy at least 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery to rule out tumor recurrence, metastases and anastomotic ulcers. The tumor marker carbohydrate antigen 19 – 9 must be determined as well.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
