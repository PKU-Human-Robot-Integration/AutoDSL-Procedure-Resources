    "Breeding pairs of C57BL/6 and CD-1 IG-S mice were purchased from Charles River. Animals used in this study were handled in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care, and study protocols were approved by the Animal Use Subcommittee at Western University, London, Canada.\n1. Animal Care\nAfter birthing is complete and pups have been initially breast-fed by their mother for a few hr, place them in a different cage with a CD-1 foster mother. CD-1 mothers display a calmer phenotype with a strong fostering instinct, and have a lower tendency to cannibalize injured pups15.\n2. Surgery\nInduce anesthesia by placing the pup in a sealed isoflurane chamber (approximately 500 µl of 100% v/v isoflurane allowed to dissipate over 1,300 cm3 chamber). Keep the mouse in the chamber until cessation of movement (about 30 sec).\nRemove mouse from isoflurane chamber and induce hypothermic anesthesia by placing mouse on wet ice. To avoid frostbite, place ice inside a sterile surgical glove, wrap the mouse within the glove and cover the glove with ice OR wrap the mouse in sterile wet gauze and place it on ice.\n\tNOTE: Mice cool faster when contact with ice is over a larger surface area, and as such melted ice can shorten hypothermia induction time.\nConfirm anesthesia by lack of movement response to toe and tail pinch.\n\tNOTE: Cessation of provoked movement occurs at a body temperature between 15 °C and 8 °C. (Cooling time to this temperature approximately 1 min). Complete apnea and asystole is NOT required for LAD ligation.\nMove the ice bed to the surgical area equipped with an operating microscope. Ensure that the mouse pup remains on ice during the whole surgical procedure.",
    "NOTE: The surgical area, gauze and surgical instruments should be sterilized. Maintain sterile field throughout the procedure, and wear single use, sterile surgical gloves. Ophthalmic ointment is not required as mice are born with their eyes closed 17.\nPlace the mouse pup in the right lateral decubitus position. Disinfect chest by gently wiping with povidone-iodine solution followed by an ethanol swab.\nPerform skin incision on the left chest along the mid-axillary line by cutting skin between the xyphoid and left axilla a few millimeters below the left foreleg. Also use scissors to cut through the underlying pectoral muscle layer.\nPerform a left thoracotomy in the 4th intercostal space by separating ribs and intercostal muscles with forceps.\n\tNOTE: Neonatal ribs are very fragile and can be easily broken. To avoid this, gently separate ribs by opening forceps along the intercostal muscle (rather than grasping ribs).\nVisualize the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) emerging from the left auricle behind the pulmonary vein and descending beyond the great cardiac vein.\n\tNOTE: In this early neonatal window, the thymus is often visualized and may cover part of the cardiac base. The LAD can be seen emerging beside the position of the thymus, depending on the angle of thoracic incision.\nLigate the LAD by passing an 11-0 nylon suture (0.007 mm diameter needle) below the artery through the mid ventricle below the left auricle (Figure 1C). Ischemia is confirmed with blanching of the myocardium below the suture site (Figure 1G).\nClose the thoracic incision using 8-0 nylon sutures (0.15 mm diameter needle). Use two sutures to close the ribs. Place both rib sutures before ligating to ensure the needle does not puncture the lungs when passing through the body cavity.",
    "After closing the ribs, remove the mouse from the ice bed. Keep the mouse within the surgical area and place it directly on the sterile surgical towel over a warm heating pad at 37 °C to begin warming.\nOnce on the sterile heated area, close the muscle and skin layers using 8-0 nylon sutures (0.15 mm diameter needle). Use one suture for the muscle layer and use two sutures for the skin incision.\n\tNOTE: Muscle and skin layers may be closed on a heating pad to reduce hypothermia exposure time. Mouse temperature begins to rise once placed on the heating pad, but remains sufficiently low enough for anesthesia maintenance during muscle and skin closure.\n3. Surgical Recovery\nContinue rapid warming on a warm heating pad until return of spontaneous movement. Do not leave an animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Remove povidone-iodine and blood by gently wiping injury site with ethanol swab.\nAfter sufficient recovery from anesthesia, remove it from sterile surgical area, smear it with bedding from foster mother's cage, and return pup to foster mother. This helps prevent maternal rejection or cannibalization.\n\tNOTE: Do not return pups to a cage with other animals until fully recovered. If an entire litter has not been used, and littermates remain with foster mother, place recovered pups in the middle of the litter. If performing more than one surgery, complete all surgeries required for an individual litter before returning mice to their foster mother.",
    "Observe behavior of foster mother toward the pup every 10 - 15 min for 2 - 3 hr to ensure acceptance of the pup. If the mother displays aggression towards the injured pup, remove the pup and euthanize by isoflurane overdose (> 5%; until cessation of breathing), followed by decapitation. NOTE: Perioperative analgesia medications are not required as the centralized pain reflexes are not fully developed at this early age15.\n4. Measurement of Myocardial Infarct Size 4 - 6 hr Post-MI\nAllow pups to recover in the care of a CD-1 foster mother for a period of 4 - 6 hr. Remove the pup from cage with mother and euthanize it by isoflurane overdose followed by decapitation with large scissors.\nExcise the heart under dissecting microscope, careful not to rip the myocardium.\n\t\nCut the skin from the xyphoid process to the top of the thorax. Open abdominal wall below the ribcage. Grasp the lower rib cage and cut through the ribs and musculature longitudinally along the left mid-axillary line from the diaphragm to the axilla.\nHold scissors in transverse plane and carefully cut through diaphragm from left to right side. Make sure to place scissors below the level of the heart so as to avoid any damage to the apex.\nGrasp rib cage and cut right side of ribs and musculature along the right mid-axillary line. Remove all vascular connections to the heart with scissors. Remove the heart from chest cavity by grasping the base.\nSection the heart into three pieces using a surgical carbon steel razor blade. Make the first cut along the short-axis of the heart at the midpoint between the suture and the cardiac apex. Make the second cut at the level of the suture (Figure 3A).",
    "NOTE: This leaves an apex section approximately 0.75 mm thick weighing 0.0018 g; a mid-base section approximately 1 mm thick, weighing 0.0065 g; and the base of the heart.\nPlace the heart sections in 1% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) at room temperature for 10 - 15 min. Carefully watch specimen to avoid over-staining.\nTo increase contrast, fix stained heart slices with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C. To calculate % infarct area, photograph heart sections and measure infarct area on imaging software. The viable myocardium stains red while the infarct area is demarcated as white18.\n5. Measurement of Cardiac Function by Echocardiography Post-MI\nAllow pups to recover in the care of a CD-1 foster mother for a period of 24 - 48 hr. Induce anesthesia by placing the pup in a sealed isoflurane chamber (5% isoflurane). Keep the mouse in the chamber until cessation of movement (about 30 sec).\nSecure the pup in the supine position on a heated dock (temperature 37 °C) with its nose in a cone to deliver 0.5 - 1% isoflurane (for anesthesia maintenance). Place pre-warmed echo gel on the left thoracic area.\nObtain a parasternal long-axis view of the left ventricle (LV). Ensure the images are obtained below the level of the suture in the LV. After acquiring the position, turn the ultrasound probe (40 MHz) 90° to obtain a parasternal short-axis view, and record M-mode echocardiographic images.\nMeasure the end diastolic and end systolic left ventricular internal diameters from the short-axis M-mode images. Calculate ejection fraction and fractional shortening.\n6. Measurement of Myocardial Infarct Size 24 hr Post-MI\nAllow pups to recover in the care of a CD-1 foster mother for a period of 24 hr. Remove the pup from cage with mother and euthanize it by isoflurane overdose followed by decapitation with large scissors.",
    "Open the chest cavity as in step 4.2. Before excising the heart, carefully grasp the thoracic aorta just above the diaphragm with fine forceps. Hold fine scissors in the coronal plane, flat against the thoracic wall, and cut the thoracic aorta off the posterior thoracic wall moving scissors in the cranial direction.\nCut the aorta free from the thoracic wall and any other connections until it reaches the heart. Excise the heart by grasping the superior vena cava and cutting all other vascular connections to the body.\nRinse the heart (with aorta attached) in saline. Carefully cannulate the thoracic aorta with a 30 gauge needle and tie aorta to cannula with 8-0 nylon suture thread.\nPerfuse the heart with 1 ml of saline through the aorta via a 30 gauge needle at a rate of 1 ml/min. Perfuse the heart with 150 µl of 2% Evans blue solution at a rate of 1 ml/min. Remove the heart from the cannula, section it into three pieces and stain it with TTC as described in section 4.\nTo calculate infarct size, photograph heart sections and measure infarct area on imaging software. The viable myocardium stains blue, the area at risk stains red, and the infarct area is demarcated as white.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
