    "NOTE: Please consult all relevant material safety data sheets (MSDS) before use. Fumes produced by laser ablation of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) can be toxic. Be sure that the laser engraver is connected to a working ventilation system. Use all appropriate safety practices when building the microfluidic device including the use of engineering controls (fume hood, sharps container) and personal protective equipment (safety glasses, face mask, gloves, lab coat, full length pants, closed-toe shoes). It is of utmost importance to use High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) grade reagents whenever possible, with all being of ACS grade or higher to decrease interfering contaminants during analysis.\n1. Preparation of the Microfluidic Device\nConstruction of the PMMA Microfluidic Platform\n\t\nObtain a standard PMMA block (8.9 x 3.8 x 0.6 cm) and laser-ablate an input channel for introducing the reagents, a proteolysis chamber, and an output channel using a laser engraver17,18.\n\t\tNOTE: Etch the proteolysis chamber in an elongated oval shape (30 x 5 x 0.05 mm). The input and output channel must extend to the end of the PMMA block and be no larger than 75 µm in both width and depth in order to accommodate a 30 ga capillary.\nCut a 30 ga stainless steel metal capillary into two pieces of approximately 10 cm each using a rotary tool with a 1/64\" thick cut-off disc. Use sandpaper to smooth the ends of the capillaries (this can be facilitated by viewing under a light microscope).\nMelt the capillaries into the etched poly(methyl methacrylate) block using a soldering iron. The input channel will be connected to automated syringe pumps, and the output channel will be used for coupling into the MS.\nConstruction of the Continuous-Flow Time-Resolved Kinetic Mixer",
    "Obtain a fused silica glass capillary (ID: 75 µm, OD: 150 µm) of approximately 40 cm, and insert it into a 28 ga stainless steel metal capillary of approximately 15 cm. Depending on the reaction time required, use a longer outer metal capillary or one with a larger ID.\n\t\tNOTE: Determining the 'true' inner diameter of the metal capillary is critical for obtaining accurate reaction times. This can be done by attaching the metal capillary to an HPLC, flowing solvent though the capillary, and recording the back pressure. A backpressure to inner diameter calculation can be made, and the true inner diameter of the metal capillary determined. This can be calculated using the Molecular Weight Calculator software (for Windows Version 6.49).\nProduce a 2 mm notch using low power laser engraver settings on one end of the inner glass capillary and seal this end of the inner glass capillary (Figure 2). Alternatively, make the notch using a ceramic glass capillary cutter tool or a rotary grinder with a fine cutting blade.\nLine-up the inner glass capillary with the end of the metal capillary (this can be facilitated by viewing under a light microscope).\nAttach this kinetic mixer to one end of the mixing tee (Figure 2).\nAttach a fused silica glass capillary (ID: 75 µm, OD: 150 µm) of approximately 40 cm to the opposite end of the kinetic mixer on the mixing tee. This is used to deliver acid (5% acetic acid, pH 2.4) to quench the reaction.\n\t\tNOTE: Reactants are supplied to the device with gas-tight syringes through polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubing using automated infusion pumps.\nPepsin Activation\n\t\nWeigh out 20 mg of pepsin from porcine gastric mucosa and suspend it in 1 mL of coupling buffer (0.1 M sodium phosphate, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 6.0).",
    "Weigh out 50 mg of N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-activated agarose beads, add to the re-suspended protease and rotate gently overnight at 4 °C.\nSpin down at 1,000 x g for 2 min at room temperature to collect the resin.\nAspirate the unbound protease.\nIncubate the agarose in 1 mL of blocking buffer (1 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.0) and rotate gently at room temperature for 1 h.\nSpin down at 1,000 x g for 2 min at room temperature to collect the resin.\nAspirate the blocking buffer.\nIncubate the pepsin-agarose with 1 mL of 5% acetic acid, pH 2.4 for 5 min.\nSpin down at 1,000 x g for 2 min to collect the resin.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nRepeat steps 1.3.8 - 1.3.10 for a total of three washes.\nStore the beads in 1 mL acetic acid at 4 °C for long-term use.\nDevice Assembly\n\t\nFill the proteolysis chamber with the slurry of activated pepsin-agarose beads in 5% acetic acid using a sterile spatula.\nPlace the PMMA microfluidic platform in between two blank PMMA blocks as a cover to seal the device, lined with silicone rubber to create a liquid tight seal.\nUse metallic clamping plates to pressure-seal the device.\n\t\tNOTE: The clamp was custom made in order to fit the microfluidic platform and is composed of two plates measuring 10.1 cm x 7.4 cm x 1.2 cm.\nFlow 5% acetic acid, pH 2.4 at a rate of 10 µL/min. Flow 50 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 6.9) though the protein line at a rate of 1 µL/min.\n\t\tNOTE: It is extremely important that the acetic acid is continuously flowing through the device throughout the entirety of the experiment. Ensure that there are no leakages and that fluid is exiting only from the output channel, which will serve as the ESI source.",
    "Couple the device to the front end of a modified quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer using an adjustable insulated stage to achieve optimal electrospray conditions.\n\t\tNOTE: A bypass switch is introduced in order to simulate the presence of a commercial ESI source.17\n2. Time-resolved ElectroSpray Ionization Hydrogen-deuterium Exchange\nAcquisition of Pepsin and Protein Only Spectra\n\tNOTE: ESI-MS acquisition is carried out in positive ion mode with a voltage of +4,500 to +5,000, 60-V declustering potential, and 250-V focusing potential. Spectra are acquired over a range of 350-1,500 m/z with a scanning rate of 1 s-1.\n\t\nAcquire a pepsin only spectrum. Any peaks appearing in this spectrum are subtracted once the protein is added.\nIntroduce 50-100 µM tau/phospho-tau protein (purify and prepare as previously described13,19) at a rate of 1 µL/min where the 50 mM ammonium acetate buffer was previously flowing.\nAcquire a protein only spectrum.\nAcquisition of Time Points\n\t\nWhile 100 µM tau/phospho-tau protein is flowing at 1 µL/min, introduce D2O at a rate of 3 µL/min via a tee connector and allow to react in the kinetic mixer. Allow for the system to equilibrate for at least 10 min before acquisition of the spectrum.\n\t\tNOTE: After the exchange, the labelling reaction is quenched by the flow of acetic acid pH 2.4 at 10 µL/min and digestion of the labelled protein occurs in the proteolytic chamber.\nIn order to increase the labelling time, manually pull back the position of the inner glass capillary to achieve mixing times of 42 ms to 8 s. Allow for the system to equilibrate for at least 10 min in between each pull-back.\n3. Data and Statistical Analysis\nIdentifying Peptides and Calculating the Percentage of Deuterium Exchange\n\t\nPerform MS spectra analyses using mMass software, version 5.5.020.",
    "Identify peptides using the ExPASy FindPept proteomic server and confirm by collision-induced dissociation (CID) when required21.\n\t\tNOTE: Here, deuterium uptake incorporation was measured using an in-house developed FORTRAN software for isotopic distribution analysis22,23.\nCalculate the theoretical intrinsic rates based on the primary sequence using the SPHERE web tool22,24.\nFit the data using single exponential non-linear regression and normalize using a graphing and statistical software (e.g., SigmaPlot).\n\t\tNOTE: The ratio of kint / kobs yields the Protection Factor (PF), a semi-quantitative measure of the degree that a particular region is structured within the conformational ensemble.\nSubscription Required.
