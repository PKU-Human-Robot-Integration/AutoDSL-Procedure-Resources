    "All data used for this manuscript were recorded after participants gave their informed consent and in line with the ethics approval of the Faculty of Human Sciences of the University of Bern [2020-04-00004].\n1. Materials\nIn order to estimate vestibular perception thresholds, ensure that there is access to a motion platform or a rotatory chair.\nEnsure that a control software for programming the motion profiles and interfacing the motion platform is present.\n\tNOTE: PlatformCommander15,16, an open-source software package to interface the motion platform, was used in this study. PlatformCommander allows for defining sinusoidal acceleration profiles, which are often used to estimate vestibular thresholds.\nEnsure that a response device, for example, a game controller, is present for registering the participants' responses.\nMotion platforms produce noise correlated with the movement intensity. Participants can use this auditory noise as an additional, unintended source of information during the estimation of vestibular perception thresholds. To mask the sound of the platform, present the participants with white noise via noise-canceling headphones during each trial.\nBlindfold the participants to eliminate the influence of visual motion cues.\nDecide on which estimation algorithm to use and define the respective parameters. If a staircase approach is used, define the starting point, the step size, the up-date, and termination rules. If the user does not know what values to choose, perform pilot measurements or consult the literature. Defaults are provided by the example scripts available online (https://gitlab.com/dr_e/2022-jovedemo).",
    "NOTE: The starting point defines the peak velocity of the platform in the first trial. Determine suitable starting velocities by pilot testing or by consulting the threshold literature (for yaw thresholds, see Grabherr et al.5). The step size describes by how much the intensity changes between trials. The up-date rule describes whether and how the stimulation intensity is changed based on the participants' responses. In the vestibular domain, a three-down/one-up staircase procedure is common. This means that the intensity is decreased after three consecutive correct answers but increased after each wrong answer. The termination criteria are usually defined by either a fixed number of trials or the number of intensity reversals. Intensity reversals are trials in which the response causes an intensity increase after one or more intensity decreases or vice versa. The provided script keeps track of the reversals, terminates the procedure, and automatically calculates the final threshold value.\nDecide for which frequency the threshold needs to be estimated. In the demonstration, 1 Hz was used.\n\tNOTE: Vestibular thresholds are typically investigated for frequencies between 0.1 and 5 Hz, and thresholds are known to decrease as stimulation frequency increases3.\nDecide for which type of motion the threshold needs to be estimated. In the demonstration, yaw rotations are performed.\n\tNOTE: Thresholds can be estimated for translations and rotations. Thresholds are most often estimated for the three main axes (naso-occipital, inter-aural, head-vertical) and the rotations around them (roll, pitch, yaw). The provided script only estimates one defined motion (direction, frequency) at a time. However, for estimating multiple thresholds, the script can be rerun with the same or different motion parameters (direction, frequency, rotation axes).",
    "Start every threshold estimation procedure with training, allowing the participant to familiarize themselves with the task. Use the script \"threshold-training.jl\" available online (see step 1.6) for this purpose.\n\tNOTE: The training script presents a series of supra-threshold motion stimuli. The test script automatically controls the estimation procedure, handles the staircase algorithm updating, the stimulus intensity, the presentation of the motion stimulus, the presentation of auditory white noise during each motion stimulus, as well as the logging of all relevant data. During the training, ensure that the participant understands the task and provide guidance in case of uncertainties.\n2. Instructions\nExplain the experimental procedure to the participant and obtain informed consent.\nSeat the participant on the chair mounted on the motion platform.\nSecure the participant using seat belts.\nGive the response buttons to the participant and explain how the keys are assigned to the responses.\nBlindfold the participant. Position the headphones on the participant's head.\nApply a proper head fixation.\nTurn on the motion platform using the main, battery, and controller switch.\nEnsure that the area around the platform is clear and that no people can approach the moving platform during the test.\nStart the training procedure script by typing julia threshold-training.jl into the command line.\nInform the participant about the engagement of the motion platform.",
    "Ensure a successful initialization of the session by checking the status displayed in the GUI of the server software (PlatformCommander). When successfully initialized, the status display will switch from Session Not Underway to Short Sequence. It will also display the IP address of the connected client and the time when the session was initialized. If the session is not successfully initialized after a few seconds, check the network connection between the client and the server. Ensure that the motion platform is switched on and that the controller is connected.\nEnsure that the participant understands the task, point out mistakes by the participant (e.g., when they push the wrong buttons), and respond to potential questions the participant may have.\nInform the participant that the training procedure is finished, and the estimation procedure is about to start.\nStart the estimation procedure script by typing julia threshold-test.jl into the command line.\nSupervise the fully automated estimation procedure until the termination criteria are reached.\nDepending on the design, repeat the procedure starting at step 2.13 using different stimuli or terminate the procedure.\nPark the motion platform.\nRemove the head fixation, headphones, blinder, and buttons, and let the participant descend.\nDebrief the participant about the procedure and ask them about their experience to improve further experiments.\n\tNOTE: The procedure can be paused and then restarted at any time, preferably not during the threshold estimation phase (steps 2.15-2.17)."
