    "1. Helmet Fit Scenarios Arrangement\nDefine fit scenarios to be studied on an anthropometric test device head and neck (Hybrid III 50th percentile male) with a head circumference of 575 mm.\n\tNOTE: An example of four fit scenarios is shown in Table 1 with helmet positions corresponding to Figure 1. The forward and backward fit scenarios were based on definitions of correct helmet use from previous epidemiological studies, which specified proper helmet position as not covering the eyebrows or exposing the forehead3.\nFor each scenario, mark each helmet position on the headform to ensure the helmet fit scenario is consistently repeated.\nUse a CPSC certified helmet, available in universal and extra-large sizes, for all fit scenarios.\n\tNOTE: According to the manufacturer provided fit guide, a universal size most appropriately fits the headform circumference.\n\t\nFor each fit scenario, keep other fit parameters consistent. Specifically, tighten the chinstrap to leave approximately one finger width of space under the chin and hand-tighten the adjustable dial to maintain a secure fit.\n2. Fit Force Measurement\nArrange five fit sensors on the skin of the headform, positioned on the front, back, left, right and top (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: The sensors are a modified version of Bragg grating force transducers developed within the research group19,20,21,22, optimized to measure fit forces over a range of 0 to 50 N. The modified sensors have a thickness and diameter of 2.6 mm and 14 mm respectively.\nTake a reference measurement with the transducers on the un-helmeted headform under no load. Take this reference measurement prior to each fit force measurement.\nPlace the helmet onto the headform and measure force data for 3 s at a rate of 2.5 kHz. Repeat the same fit scenario six times for repeated measurements.\nRepeat the same measurement procedure for all fit scenarios.",
    "Convert wavelength shift data to force measurements by multiplying the measured wavelengths from the transducer by the pre-determined calibration constant for the fit force transducer.\n3. Drop Tower for Impact Simulation\nSimulate impact to the helmeted head by linearly guiding the headform to hit an impact surface19,23. The equipment required to do this is context specific, as detailed below.\nAssemble a drop tower to consist of an adjustable drop gimbal, an anthropometric test device head and neck, and a variable impact surface.\n\t\tNOTE: The total drop assembly mass is approximately 11 kg. The added mass of the gimbal accounts for the exclusion of the full human body as an effective torso mass to better simulate a realistic impact24.\nArrange 9 uni-axial accelerometers in a 3-2-2-2 configuration within the headform to allow linear and angular accelerations of the headform to be determined at the center of gravity25.\nArrange a purpose built velocity gate on the impact tower to measure impact velocity immediately before impact.\nCollect head acceleration and neck force/moment data using the data acquisition system. Filter analog voltages, sampled at 100 kHz for all channels. Prior to the data acquisition system, include a hardware anti-aliasing low pass filter with a corner frequency of 4 kHz26.\nArrange the impact scenario.\nFor all impacts, remove the helmet visor to allow for better visibility during motion tracking. The effect of the visor during impact is assumed to be negligible due to its loose attachment.\nArrange all drops to impact the forehead. This is a common impact location in cycling27, although other scenarios could also be simulated.\nSimulate six different impact scenarios by varying impact speed, impact surface, and either head-first or torso-first impacts as per Table 2.",
    "Raise the headform to the appropriate height, corresponding to specified impact velocities. Drop the headform from an appropriate height, typically 0.82 m and 1.83 m, to achieve velocities of 4 m/s and 6 m/s, respectively.\n\t\tNOTE: Add height as necessary to overcome friction losses. Two impact velocities of 4 m/s and 6 m/s can be chosen based off previous literature and standards28.\nArrange the impact surface.\n\t\t\nArrange either a flat or a 45° angled anvil (Figure 4). The flat anvil simulates falls on a flat surface, while the angled anvil simulates impacts with a tangential velocity component.\nCover both of the surfaces of the anvils in abrasive tape to simulate an asphalt surface. Adjust the anvil position as necessary between impacts to ensure the helmet to be impacted contacts only the flat surface of the anvil.\nArrange the drop tower for either head-first or torso-first impact. Simulate both head-first and torso-first impacts, with torso impacts similar to the combined loading impact configuration presented in Smith et al.18\nTo simulate a head-first impact, do not adjust the drop tower.\nTo simulate the torso hitting the ground before the head, place a wooden block in the path of the drop gimbal. Place this wooden block at a height such that the head is approximately 25 mm away from impacting the anvil at the torso-impact. The head will then continue to hit the anvil by means of neck flexion only.\nInclude a layer of foam to minimize vibrations from the drop tower (Figure 5).\nIn contrast to head-first impacts, adjust the angle of the neck in torso-first impacts.",
    "NOTE: This neck angle adjustment allows for the head to impact the anvil on the forehead after flexion, so that impact location is comparable to the head-first impact case (Figure 6). In addition to forehead impacts, this torso-first scenario would certainly be relevant in side impacts as well. In both head-first and torso-first impacts, this gimbal system allows for movement of the head and neck along the track after impact.\nTrigger the data acquisition system, high speed cameras (see section 4), and drop of the headform simultaneously. Repeat the same impact and fit scenario configuration 3 times with new helmets each time.\n\tNOTE: The high-speed cameras will need to be set up concurrently with the drop tower, detailed in section 4.\nSubject each of the four fit scenarios to each of the 6 different impact scenarios. Perform a total of 72 drops after 3 trials of each configuration.\nPost-process the headform kinematic and kinetic data.\nFilter analog signals for acceleration and force/moment subsequently using a 4th order Butterworth filter in post processing to meet industry suggested practice26. Filter head accelerations and neck forces as per Channel Frequency Class (CFC) 1000. Filter neck moments as per CFC 600.\n4. Motion Capture Using a High Speed Dual Camera System\nNOTE: Recording marker positions from two high speed cameras allow three-dimensional marker positions to be determined with the DLT method16 in post-processing. To determine head-helmet displacements, track markers on both the headform and helmet during impact.\nArrange high-speed cameras around the drop tower.\nArrange two high-speed cameras around the drop tower to capture synchronized images of the helmet and headform movement during impact.",
    "Place a master camera to the side of the drop tower and place a slave camera at approximately 45° from the master (Figure 7). Setup a 250 W light between the cameras to allow for sufficient exposure.\nConfigure high speed cameras.\nEquip each camera with either a 50 mm f/1.4 or 100 mm f/2.0 macro lens, depending on the field of view required. Set the apertures on the lenses at f/8.0.\n\t\tNOTE: This aperture allows for sufficiently sharp focus in the desired depth of field. The required field of view ranged from 30-60 cm, depending on the impact scenario.\nConfigure both cameras to record at 1280 x 800 pixels at a frame rate of 1000 frames per second or faster. Thus, the maximum exposure time per frame will be 600 µs.\nSynchronize the two cameras in frames and internal clock. Set up a trigger so that both cameras trigger simultaneously.\nCalibrate the space by taking a still image of a calibration frame from each camera.\n\tNOTE: For the direct linear transformation (DLT) method, the space must be initially calibrated.\n\t\nMove a calibration cage with 17 known calibration point locations into the field of view of both cameras and take a single image from each camera. A minimum of 11 common points must be visible from both cameras.\nFind the two-dimensional coordinates of each marker with tracking software.\n\t\tNOTE: A coordinate measuring machine (CMM) determines the point locations of the calibration cage prior to DLT calibration.\nUsing a series of calculations performed with the calibration markers' coordinates (known as DLT)16, transform any two dimensional marker locations into three-dimensional coordinates relative to the calibration cage coordinate system in post-processing.",
    "To quantify helmet displacement, track the distance between a point on the headform forehead and the brim of the helmet using the tracking software.\n\tNOTE: Because these points are not visible from both cameras, track a set of three visible markers on each the headform and helmet instead. The points on the forehead and helmet can then be indirectly tracked.\nPlace motion tracking markers on the headform and take a still reference image of the headform from each camera.\nFor this method of indirect marker tracking, take a headform reference image with each camera. Ensure that this reference image consists of three markers and a reference marker defined on the head.\nMaximize the distance between markers using three reference point locations while remaining in both cameras' field of views.\n\t\tNOTE: Maximizing the distance allows for better accuracy by decreasing indirect marker tracking sensitivity to tracking errors. The three markers allow for the three-dimensional reconstruction of motion in post processing, as well as the estimation of the forehead location.\nHold the reference marker between the eyes on the lower forehead and the other markers spread across the headform. Ensure that these three other markers are visible from both cameras throughout an impact (Figure 8).\nPlace motion tracking markers on the helmet and take still reference images of the helmet from each camera as described for the headform reference (section 4.5).\nEnsure that the reference consists of viewing at least four motion tracking markers. Hold one marker on the bottom of the helmet brim as a reference and spread the other three markers on the helmet. Ensure that these three markers are visible from both cameras throughout an impact. Take a single image from each camera for the helmet reference (Figure 9).",
    "Trigger the data acquisition system, high speed cameras, and drop of the headform simultaneously as described in section 3.\n\tNOTE: The drop tower will need to be set up concurrently with the high-speed cameras. After taking reference images, a drop may be performed.\n\t\nArrange the helmet fit scenario. Record the drop. Signal a trigger to the cameras manually upon impact. Arrange recording so that 3 s is recorded prior to the trigger and 8 s is recorded after the trigger. Manually review and bracket the synchronized camera images to contain the impact only.\n5. Head-helmet Marker Tracking and Post-processing\nTrack head and helmet markers throughout the impact, using camera-specific software.\nTrack six points per drop: three on both the helmet and headform (Figure 10). With the software, determine the transient two-dimensional pixel coordinates of each marker.\nUse the DLT method to calculate three-dimensional coordinates of tracked markers during a drop.\n\tNOTE: With the calibration data from the calibration cage and the drop data from the two cameras, the DLT method can determine the three-dimensional coordinates of the tracked markers during a drop.\nUse the SVD (singular value decomposition) method17 to calculate the 3-D dimensional coordinates of the headform forehead and helmet brim. The difference between these two points is head-helmet displacement.\nUse the SVD method to estimate the location of a reference point on each the headform forehead and helmet brim from the tracked markers.\nUse the SVD method to find the transformation matrix of the three markers between the reference frame and each individual frame of a drop. This transformation can be applied to find either the forehead or helmet brim locations.\nPerform this indirect tracking on both the helmet and headform. The displacement between the forehead and helmet brim can then be monitored (Figure 11).",
