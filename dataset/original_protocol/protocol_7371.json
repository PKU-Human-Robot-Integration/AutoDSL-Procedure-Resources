    "Generation of a stable and inducible MTS-eGFP cell line with lentiviral particles   Note: All steps described in section A have to be conducted in a laboratory approved for lentiviral work.  Seed 3.5 × 106  HEK 293T cells in a 10 cm tissue culture dish containing DMEM (v/v) 10% FBS medium to obtain a density of 80% confluence the next day.Exchange medium with 9 mL of pre-warmed DMEM (v/v) 1% FBS the day after seeding.Mix plasmids with corresponding ratio (5 μg total DNA for 10 cm culture dish) of pHDM-VSV-G (ratio: 2, 0.4 µg), pHDM-Hgpm2 (ratio: 1, 0.2 µg), pHDM-tatIB (ratio: 1, 0.2 µg), pRC-CMV-revIB (ratio: 1, 0.2 µg), and pLD-puro-MTS-EGFP (ratio: 20, 4 µg) with 500 µL of Opti-MEM I in tube number 1.Mix 15 µL of lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent with 500 µL of Opti-MEM I in tube number 2. Note: Instead of Lipofectamine 2000, other transfection reagents can be used.  Add DNA mixture from tube number 1 to tube number 2, mix, and incubate for 10 min at room temperature.Add mix to the cells in a dropwise manner to reach 10 mL in total.Exchange medium with 10 mL of pre-warmed DMEM (v/v) 10% FBS after 6 h.Harvest lentiviral particles after 48 h by collecting medium.Spin the collected supernatant at 2000  × g  for 3 min to pellet transferred HEK 293T cells. Transfer the supernatant containing lentiviral particles to a new tube. Note: Alternatively, 0.45 µm filters can be used to remove transferred HEK 293T cells.  Store the lentiviral particle containing supernatant at 4 °C for up to one week or at -80 °C for longer storage.Seed 2 × 106  HeLa FlpIn TRex cells in a 10 cm tissue culture dish containing RPMI (v/v) 10% FBS medium to obtain a density of 60% confluence the next day.Add 0.",
    "8–1 mL of supernatant containing lentiviral particles obtained in step A9 per 10 cm dish with polybrene (final concentration of 8 µg/mL) the day after seeding. Note: Do not remove the culture medium before adding the supernatant containing lentiviral particles. Also, it is not necessary to determine the concentration of lentiviral particles in the supernatant.  Incubate cells with lentiviral particles for 48 h. Note: Exchange the medium with fresh, pre-warmed RPMI (v/v) 10% FBS medium during the incubation period if the cells show signs of stress.  Start selection of lentivirus-infected HeLa FlpIn TRex cells by puromycin addition (final concentration of 1 µg/mL) to the RPMI (v/v) 10% FBS medium, 48 h after transduction.Select for lentivirus-infected cells for a total of 11 days and by a minimum of three passages in RPMI (v/v) 10% FBS medium containing 1 µg/mL puromycin. Note: The generated cell line is stable, can be frozen in RPMI (v/v) 10% FBS medium containing 10% DMSO (v/v) at -80 °C and stored ≤ -150 °C. Cells can be cultured in regular RPMI (v/v) 10% FBS medium after completing puromycin selection for 11 days.   Cell seeding  Aspirate medium from a 10 cm tissue culture dish containing HeLa FlpIn TRex cells carrying the genomically integrated MTS-eGFP reporter grown in RPMI (v/v) 10% FBS at 60%–80% confluence. Note: This step is performed with cells obtained in the previous step, i.e., after 11 days of puromycin selection.  Wash cell layer once with 5 mL of room temperature PBS and aspirate.Add 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin to cell layer and incubate the plate for 5 min in the incubator.Add 9 mL of RPMI (v/v) 10% FBS to stop tryptic reaction and resuspend cells by pipetting up and down repeatedly.",
    "Collect cell suspension in a 15 mL tube and pellet cells by centrifugation at 800  × g  for 3 min.Aspirate supernatant and resuspend cells in 5 mL of RPMI (v/v) 10% FBS by pipetting up and down repeatedly.Transfer 5 µL of cell suspension to a 1.5 mL tube and mix with 5 µL of trypan blue solution.Transfer 8.5 µL of stained cell suspension to a counting slide and count viable cells.Seed 10–20,000 viable cells per well of a black 96-well cell culture microplate in RPMI (v/v) 10% FBS and grow cells overnight in the incubator. Treatment, induction of MTS-eGFP expression, and mitochondrial staining  Prepare treatment solution containing the compound or vehicle at the appropriate concentration and 0.25 µg/mL doxycycline to induce MTS-eGFP expression in pre-warmed RPMI (v/v) 10% FBS. Note: According to Moullan et al. (2015), the used doxycycline concentration should not affect mitochondrial function in HeLa cells.  Start treatment and doxycycline induction by aspirating the growth medium and adding the treatment medium to the cells in the 96-well plate. Note: The protocol was tested for 6 h of treatment with 10 µM CCCP, a mitochondrial uncoupler, and 10 µM GTPP, a mitochondrial chaperone inhibitor, both of which rapidly reduce mitochondrial protein import and might be used as positive controls (Michaelis et al., 2022). DMSO was used as vehicle control.  Incubate cells in the incubator during treatment.Aspirate treatment medium and stain cells with 50 nM MitoTrackerTM  Deep Red FM in pre-warmed RPMI (v/v) 10% FBS for 20 min in the incubator.Aspirate medium, wash cells once with PBS, and add fresh RPMI (v/v) 10% FBS. Live cell imaging  Transfer the 96-well plate with cells to the Yokogawa CQ-1 microscope chamber pre-equilibrated to 37 °C, 5% CO2  .",
    "Acquire live cell images of eGFP (488 nm excitation, 525/50 nm emission) and MitoTrackerTM  Deep Red FM (640 nm excitation, 685/40 nm emission) of at least 100 cells per replicate at 60× magnification with automated focus (example images shown in Figure 1). Notes:   Adjust the laser power and exposure times (maximum 500 ms) to obtain non-saturated images.   It is recommended to acquire z-stacks to obtain in-focus images of as many cells as possible per field of view. Z-stacks are typically acquired with 6–10 slides within 3–5 µm radius around the central focus.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4578/bioprotoc-12-24-4578-g001.jpg Figure 1. Live cell images of MTS-eGFP and MitoTrackerTM  Deep Red FM upon DMSO and CCCP treatment.  HeLa FlpIn TRex cells carrying MTS-eGFP were treated for 6 h with doxycycline and 10 µM CCCP or 1 µL/mL DMSO as vehicle control (left). Scale bar represents 25 µm. Results of correlation-based co-localization analysis using ImageJ Coloc2 are shown (right)."
