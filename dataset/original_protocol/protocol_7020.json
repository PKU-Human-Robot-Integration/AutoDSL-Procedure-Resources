    "Generation of yeast competent cells for long-term storage:Grow 100 ml of your fission yeast strain auxotrophic for leucine in PMG medium supplemented with leucine, histidine, lysine, adenine, and uracil at 30°C till they reach mid to late-log phase (A600 0.5 to 0.9). Use shaking conditions of 220 rotations per minute. Note: Cells must be grown in medium lacking thiamine. Do not grow cells in YES medium (Sabatinos and Forsburg, 2010), which contains thiamine.  Transfer cells to a 250 ml centrifuge bottle and spin cells at 4,500 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Remove supernatant, resuspend in 5 ml of sterile water, and transfer suspension to a 15 ml centrifuge tube. Spin cells at 4,500 × g for 3 min.Remove supernatant and resuspend in 2 ml of LiOAc-mix.Note: Resuspend using 5 ml serological pipette (or greater volume). Split sample into two 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tubes and spin cells at 4,500 × g for 2 min at room temperature.Resuspend cells in LiOAc-mix in a final volume (cells + LiOAc-mix) of 1 ml for each aliquot.Add 0.5 ml of 50% glycerol/LiOAc-mix for each aliquot and mix by inverting the tubes or gentle pipetting.Split sample into 300 µl aliquots and store in standard 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tubes at -80°C.Note: Each 300 µl aliquot is sufficient for four transformations. Smaller or larger aliquots can be made. Each aliquot can be thawed (on ice) and re-frozen a maximum of two times. Limit the time in between thaw and re-freeze to maintain competence. In the interim, dry ice may be used for freezing cells before transfer to -80°C. Transformation efficiency decreases with each freeze-thaw cycle (empirical observation). Yeast transformationThaw competent cells (on ice), ssDNA, and plasmid DNA (concentration of approximately 1-2 mg/ml).",
    "For each transformation, mix 3 µl ssDNA, 2 µl plasmid DNA, and 70 µl cells. A mix of ssDNA and cells can be made before making aliquots for each transformation.Incubate at room temperature for 10 min (shaking not required).Add 290 µl PEG-mix and mix by gently inverting tubes multiple times till uniform.Incubate samples at 30°C for 1 h (shaking not required).Heat shock at 42°C for 5 min.Cool samples at room temperature for 5 min (shaking not required).Spin for 1 min at 4,500 × g at room temperature.Remove supernatant and resuspend cells in 100 µl sterile water at room temperature.Gently spread sample(s) on selective agar plate(s) using glass beads and incubate at 30°C till the appearance of single colonies (3-4 days). Leucine dropout or Leu-PMG agar medium is used for selecting the pTIN-system plasmids.Patch single transformants on Leu-PMG agar and incubate at 30°C for 1-2 days. It is best to use freshly grown transformants, but agar plates may be stored at 4°C for up to 5 days.Induction and expression from the pTIN-system in yeastInoculate patched transformants in Leu-PMG medium and grow for 5-6 h at 30°C.Dilute cells in Leu-PMG or Leu-PMG with 15 µM thiamine liquid medium and grow for the requisite amount of time needed for the experiment. The mRNA is expressed to peak levels by 1 h, and half-maximal protein expression, as assayed by Pho1 (cell surface acid phosphatase) reporter activity, is achieved by 5.6 h (Garg, 2020). To achieve lower target gene expression, thiamine concentration can be varied between 0.01 and 0.3 µM. Concentrations ≥0.3 µM lead to maximal derepression of the target gene (Garg, 2020). [15 µM thiamine has been widely utilized to repress the  nmt1+ promoter (Forsburg, 1993) and is thus used for maximal derepression from the pTIN-system].",
    "Cells can be used for the assay of choice after the desired period of overexpression.For growth analysis, continue from step 1. Dilute cells to 0.1 A600 and make serial dilutions (e.g., 5-fold dilution series) in Leu-PMG medium. Spot 3 µl of the serial dilutions on Leu-PMG Agar or Leu-PMG Agar containing 15 µM thiamine. Incubate plates at the desired temperatures. Incubation time can be adjusted until the desired colony size is achieved. Incubation duration must be standardized to allow the formation of similar colony sizes of wild-type cells when grown at different temperatures."
