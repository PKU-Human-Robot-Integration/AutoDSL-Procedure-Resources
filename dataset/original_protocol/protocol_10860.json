    "This protocol was executed in compliance with the procedural regulations of the Bioethics Committee of the University of Burgos (Spain) number IO 03/2022. Before participating, the respondents were made fully aware of the research objectives and provided their informed consent. They received no financial compensation for their participation.\n1. Participant recruitment\nRecruit adult participants aged between 20 years old and 56 years old from two groups (students and teachers) in higher education, specifically undergraduate students in occupational therapy.\n\tNOTE: Table 1 shows the list of students disaggregated by teaching modality and by age and gender. The PBL methodology was used at two different periods during the COVID-19 pandemic: the state of emergency with full confinement (teaching had to be via e-Learning due to total confinement) and the state of emergency with partial confinement (only students who tested positive for COVID-19 or who had been in direct contact with someone testing positive were confined; in this case, b-Learning was applied).\nTable 1: Sample characteristics. Sample characteristics (age, gender) in both groups (e-Learning teaching method vs. b-Learning teaching method). Abbreviations: e-Learning = online classes; b-Learning = blended classes (online and physical classes); M age =Mean age; SD age=Standard deviation age.

Experimental procedure\nSession 1: Collecting consents and briefing the participants\n\t\nCollect informed consent, personal data, and background knowledge.\nDuring the first week of teaching, inform the trainees about the objectives of the study and about data collection, processing, and storage. If the students agree to participate, ask them to sign an informed consent form.\n\t\tNOTE: Participation in this study was voluntary, and there was no financial compensation. This aspect ensures motivation toward the execution of the task free of economic conditioning factors.\nSession 2: Assessing the students' prior knowledge",
    "During the first week of teaching, ask the students to complete a questionnaire about their prior knowledge of the core subject concepts. Record the answers to the closed questions in a dichotomous manner or on a Likert-type scale from 1 to 5 (Table 2).\n\t\tNOTE: The prior knowledge questionnaire contains closed questions related to the methodology to be applied in the subject, which, in this case, includes personalized voice assistants to report course events, process-oriented automatic feedback systems, virtual laboratories, flipped classroom experiences, and PBL. The questionnaire was applied anonymously through the UBUVirtual learning platform, which is a Moodle environment (Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment) and was filled in by the students online. The questionnaire in this study had a Cronbach's alpha reliability index of α = 0.88 for the overall scale and α = 0.87-0.89 for each of the items if the item was removed. The questionnaire also includes an open-ended question about the student's motivation toward the subject.\nSession 3: Informing the students about the project-based teaching methodology and the different resources to be used\n\t\nProvide the students with a guide for how PBL will be delivered as well as rubrics for the evaluation of the project and the presentation of the project.\nInform the students about the advanced learning technology resources available (intelligent voice assistants, process-oriented personalized feedback, virtual laboratories, questionnaires with feedbackon the qualification, flipped classroom experiences,and PBL experiences).\n\t\tNOTE: Students have access to a document detailing the PBL methodology (see Supplemental Material Appendix 1) and two rubrics for carrying out the project and presenting it (see Supplemental Material Appendix 2).\n\t\t\nEnsure that, in the e-Learning group, students are assisted by an intelligent voice assistant that informs them about course events.",
    "In the b-Learning group, do not use this resource, but ask the participants to carry out the project in a physical simulation laboratory and not only virtually, as in the case of the e-learning group.\nSession 4: Choice of case study\n\t\nOrganize the students into groups of two to five participants and ask each group to choose from a series of practical cases related to different developmental disorders (physical, psychological, or sensory) in children aged 0-6 years.\n\t\tNOTE: The case studies include data from the clinical history (an example can be found in the Supplemental Material Appendix 3).\nSession 5: Description of the scope of the project intervention\n\t\nAsk each group to prepare an introduction describing the type of service in which they will implement their project (they can choose between an intervention in the field of health, education, patient groups, or private services within the framework of early care).\n\t\tNOTE: The students elaborate the works in a creative way; some examples can be consulted in the Supplemental Material Appendix 4.\nSession 6: Description of the professionals working in the intervention area\n\t\nAsk each group to describe the role of the professionals who will intervene, as well as the relationship structure that will be applied, encouraging interdisciplinary working.\nSession 7: Description of the intervention case study\n\t\nAsk each group to describe the characteristics of the pathology or developmental disorder.\nSession 8: Creation of the intervention program",
    "Ask each group to prepare various phases within the intervention program that address the following elements: an initial user assessment, the proposed evaluation indicators based on the results from the initial assessment, the proposed intervention procedure to achieve the development of skills or behaviors in children, the materials required for the intervention, a proposal of the generalization activities, and a plan for the follow-up for the intervention.\n\t\t\nIn virtual laboratories, have the teacher help the students in the e-Learning group.\n\t\t\tNOTE. For an example of the help provided to the e-Learning students in virtual laboratories, see Supplemental Material Appendix 5.\nCarry out this part of the project via practical classes in the simulation center for the b-Learning group.\nSession 9: Production of a project document\n\t\nAsk each group to provide a document explaining the project created for the practical case chosen.\n\t\tNOTE: The project is evaluated using the project development evaluation rubric (see Supplemental Material Appendix 2).\nSession 10: Presentation of the project\n\t\nAsk each group to present the project about the practical case they chose.\n\t\tNOTE: The presentation is given to their classmates and the professor.\nEvaluate the presentation. Perform the evaluation of the presentation according to the presentation evaluation rubric (see Supplemental Material Appendix 2).\nSession 11: Follow-up of the students' work\n\t\nAssess the interaction of the student groups on the UBUVirtual platform via the students' behavior monitoring software41 tool, which allows the interaction of students to be analyzed individually (Figure 2) and in groups (Figure 3).\nTo perform group analysis: Click the Group Icon > Group 01 > Select All > Logs. Select Components > Select All pointing from Visual Analytics and then select Heatmap. This will generate a heatmap that allows the interaction to be analyzed individually, as shown in Figure 2.",
    "To perform the individual analysis: Click Select All > Comparisons. Select Logs > Components. Then, click Select All pointing from Visual Analytics and select Heatmap. This will generate a heatmap that allows the interaction to be analyzed as a group, as shown in Figure 3.\nUse the tool to determine what interactions each student has individually (Figure 4) and within a group (follow step 2.11.2 and step 2.11.3).\nSession 12: Evaluation of student satisfaction with project-based learning\n\t\nAsk each student to complete an opinion survey about their satisfaction with PBL work at the end of the course (Table 3).\n\t\tNOTE: The PBL satisfaction survey consists of 17 closed response questions measured on a Likert-type scale from 1 to 5 and two open response questions. The Cronbach's alpha reliability index in this study was α = 0.89 for the overall scale and α = 0.88-0.91 for each item if the item was removed.\nSession 13: Data analysis\n\t\nFor the first question (RQ1: Are there significant differences in the learning outcomes and satisfaction of health sciences students studying occupational therapy depending on whether the PBL methodology is implemented via e-Learning versus b-Learning, considering the effects of students' prior knowledge?), import all the data from the spreadsheet into the statistical program, SPSS42: elaboration of PBL (LOEPBL), presentation of PBL (LOEXPBL), learning outcomes total (LOT), obtaining LMS access (LMSA), satisfaction of the students with teaching (SPBL), the independent variable (the type of e-Learning modality, i.e., implementation year of the teaching, and the covariate (prior knowledge).\n\t\t\nDo this for both the groups of e-Learning versus b-Learning teaching modalities (during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic with online teaching) and for b-Learning (during the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic with mixed teaching, partly in person and partly online).",
    "Perform an ANCOVA with fixed effects (teaching modality: e-Learning vs. b-Learning) and the covariate (prior knowledge).\nSelect Multivariate Analysis and include the dependent variables (LOEPBL, LOEXPBL, LOT, LMSA, and SPBL), the independent variable (the type of teaching modality for b-Learning), and the covariate (prior knowledge).\nEstimate the marginal means and perform the ANCOVA analysis by pressing the OK button.\nFor the second question (RQ2: Do the clusters of participants found match the learning outcomes, learning behaviors, and perceived satisfaction as a function of teaching modality [e-Learning vs. b-Learning]?), perform the following steps:\n\t\t\nSelect Means cluster analysis and then the variables LOEPBL, LOEXPBL, LOT, LMSA, and SPBL. Then, select Cluster Membership then pause very slightly, click Continuous and pause very slightly again. Select Initial cluster centers > ANOVA table > cluster information for each case. Then, select Continue.\nSelect the cross table between the data found for cluster membership and the e-Learning versus b-Learning teaching modality groups. For Row, select the Variable Year (the type of e-Learning modality, i.e., teaching implementation year). For Column, select the Cluster Number of the case.\nPerform a cluster analysis using visualizing software. To do so, import the data into the visualizing software and select Heat Map > Radviz. Implement the visualization of the clusters with the different variables studied with respect to the relationship with the teaching modality used.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The free data mining software43 (see the Table of Materials) was used for this analysis.\nFor the third question (RQ3: Are the students' suggestions for the improvement of the PBL methodology different depending on the teaching modality, e-Learning versus b-Learning?), perform the following steps.",
    "Perform a qualitative analysis of the open answers found in the PBL13 satisfaction scale for the two groups of e-Learning versus b-Learning using qualitative data analysis software44. Import the answers to the open-ended questions obtained on the satisfaction of the students with the teaching (SPBL) into the software.\nSelect Categorizing Student Responses in the two teaching modalities, e-Learning versus b-Learning.\nSelect the Document group (teaching modality: e-Learning vs. b-Learning) analysis.\nSelect Sankey Diagram.\nExport the results into a spreadsheet software.\n\t\t\tNOTE: First, the responses to the open-ended questions were categorized in each teaching modality group (e-Learning vs. b-Learning), and a frequency analysis was performed on the responses by group and categorization. The results were visualized using a Sankey diagram. This was done using qualitative data analysis software44 (see the Table of Materials)\nTable 2: Prior knowledge questionnaire13.
