  "procedures": [
    "Threshold detectionThis protocol is designed to measure odorant sensitivity by determining the lowest concentration of a certain odor that is perceivable by the sense of smell.The group of mice that is going to be tested is kept in ventilated racks in a different room. Each mouse is extracted from its cage under a hood and placed in an empty clean box for transportation to the testing room. After the test, the mouse is returned to the original cage and the transportation box is thoroughly wiped clean.General habituation to the testing conditionsThe mice are first exposed to the general environment and procedure.The mouse is gently placed in the testing box (Figure 2) previously covered with a uniform layer of clean bedding not exceeding 1 cm in height. We recommend covering the box with the transparent lid during testing.Note: An excess of bedding in the testing box stimulates exploratory behaviors, such as scratching and digging, which may distract the mouse from the main task. On the contrary, mouse mobility is hindered and interferences with depositions are increased if the bedding is too little or absent at all.The mouse is allowed a 3-min period of free exploration for context processing and habituation (Fanselow, 2000).A cotton stick soaked in mineral oil is introduced into the box through the little hole located in one of the box walls. The stick should protrude from the wall approximately 3 cm and it is held in place for 1 min.Note: To impregnate the sticks, take 20 µl of the solution with a micropipette, close the tube lid immediately afterwards and deposit the 20 µl-drop directly into the swab head. An easy way to hold the stick in place without vibrations during the one-minute exposure is to use sticks that have been manually bent at right angles.",
    "Once the soaked end of the stick is passed through the hole, the other end can be easily fixed to the outside of the box wall with adhesive tape. It takes only a few seconds to change the stick. Avoid touching the testing box walls or the inner part of the hole with the impregnated swab. Use a lab timer without acoustic alarm to control time.The first exposure to the mineral oil-soaked stick is followed by 4 more successive exposures to new sticks freshly soaked in the same mineral oil to produce a habituation to the stick and to its movement in and out of the box. This part of the test can also reveal differences between genotypes/strains in their exploratory response to novel objects. Use a digital video system to record the behavior of the animal throughout the testing.Threshold detectionAfter the 5 trials with the non-odorant stimulus, the mouse will be exposed to cotton sticks with increasing concentrations of one of the scents (diluted in mineral oil at 1:160, 1:80, 1:40, 1:20, and 1:10) to determine the minimum concentration that triggers exploration by the animal. We usually employ citralva for this task, but it can be done with any of the two odorants.A cotton stick soaked in the scent at the lowest concentration is introduced into the box, as done previously for sticks with mineral oil, and held in place for 1 min.Note: Use a new stick for every trial and immediately discard used sticks by placing them in a sealed container or zipped garbage bag.A cotton stick soaked in mineral oil is then used in the same way. Next stick is soaked in the same scent but at double the concentration of the previous one.The procedure is then repeated until all concentrations have been tested.",
    "Use a digital video system to record the behavior of the animal throughout the testing.The inter-trial interval (ITI) is defined as the time between exposures to the odorants. This interval should allow the mouse to show specific olfactory behaviors towards each scented stick without resulting in a general loss of interest in the task. For this test, an ITI of 1-2 min is recommended. Indeed, we use a one-minute ITI, during which we expose the animal to a stick impregnated in mineral oil (see step A2g). It is important to keep in mind that a very prolonged ITI can change the novelty value of each trial (Breton-Provencher et al., 2009) whereas very short ITIs can induce one habituation to context too fast (Sanderson and Bannerman, 2011). Differences in the behavioral performance of mice in the control and experimental groups under analysis in this test indicate differences in olfactory perception (see, for example, Delgado et al., 2014; Figure 3A).Olfactory habituation-dishabituationThe animals will be exposed to two different scents to test olfactory discrimination, or how the animals perceive the difference. This protocol is designed to test the habituation to a specific odor, indicated by the progressive decrease in the exploration time in successive presentations, and the dishabituation, indicated by increased exploration of a novel, distinct odor.This second test should be run with a set of mice that is different from the ones tested in the odorant detection test, as novel and familiar odors are coded differently (Kato et al., 2012) and familiarity of odors could influence olfactory exploration and the grade of stimulus novelty perceived by the mouse.General habituation to the testing conditions (follow section 1 in Procedure A).",
    "Habituation/dishabituation: After the 5 trials with the non-odorant stimulus, the mouse will be exposed to 5 presentations of one scent followed by 5 exposures to a different scent.Note: A concentration of odorant that is perceived equally well by the control and experimental group will be used for this task. We routinely use 1:20. A cotton stick impregnated with 20 µl of geraniol at 1:20 is introduced into the box, as done previously for sticks with mineral oil, and held in place for 1 min. Note: Use a new stick for every trial and immediately discard used sticks by placing them in a sealed container or zipped garbage bag.A cotton stick soaked in mineral oil is then used in the same way.Steps B2a-b are repeated 4 more times.A cotton stick impregnated with 20 µl of citralva at 1:20 is introduced into the box and held in place for 1 min. A cotton stick soaked in mineral oil is then used in the same way.Steps B2d-e are repeated 4 more times. Use a digital video system to record the behavior of the animal throughout the testing.Habituation is reflected as a reduction in exploratory time after the first or first and second exposures to the same odor; dishabituation is reflected as a renovated interest in the novel odorant stimulus (see Figure 3B). It is important to use a scent concentration that is appropriate for the test. The same odorant molecule can induce attractive or repulsive responses depending on its concentration (Yoshida et al., 2012). Moreover, olfactory sensory receptors may fail to generate action potentials at very high odorant concentrations (Ghatpande and Reisert, 2011).",
    "We recommend using the lowest concentration at which all animals clearly perceived the olfactory stimulus in the threshold detection test; that is, the concentration at which more animals exhibit the highest exploration time. In our experiments with geraniol and citralva in CD1 and C57BL/6J mice, these concentrations were either 1:40 or 1:20."
