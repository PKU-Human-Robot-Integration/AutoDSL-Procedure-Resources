    "Simultaneous intranasal/intravascular antibody labeling (see Videos 1 and 2)Dilute 0.25 μg CD45-BV510 antibody in 100 μl DPBS in a 1.5 ml microtube (for intranasal labelling). Dilute 0.5 μg CD90.2-APC-eFuor 780 antibody in 300 μl DPBS in another 1.5 ml microtube and load the antibody into a 1 ml insulin syringe with a 28 G x ½ needle (for intravenous labelling). Place the microtube and the syringe on ice until use. (see Note 1)Put a plastic desiccator in a fume hood. Place some gauze in the bottom chamber followed by 5 ml of isoflurane. (see Note 2)Place a mouse on the grate inside the desiccator (see Note 3). Load a P200 micropipette with 100 µl of CD45-BV510 antibody.Immediately after the rate of respiration slows, pick up the mouse, hold it vertically and slowly deliver 100 µl of CD45-BV510 antibody onto the mouse nostrils. Hold the mouse upright so that the liquid on the nostrils is completely aspirated into the lungs.Place the mouse back in the cage. After 2 min, turn on the heat lamp over the cage and warm up the mouse for 1 min.Remove the mouse from the cage, put it in a mouse restrainer and inject 0.5 μg CD90.2-APC-eFuor 780 antibody in 300 μl DPBS through the tail vein with the 1 ml insulin syringe prepared in point 1. Release the mouse from the restrainer and immediately anesthetize the mouse by intraperitoneal injection of 300 µl of avertin solution. Secure the mouse in the palm of the hand and hold it horizontally, then insert the needle at a shallow angle tangential to the mouse and slowly dispense avertin solution into the peritoneal cavity.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1.

    "Harvest of bronchoalveolar fluid, to obtain airway resident cells  Prepare a 1 ml syringe with 20 G x 1 needle. Carefully pass about 1.25 inches 20 G tubing onto the needle. Sharpen the end of the tubing with scissors. Load the syringe with 1 ml complete RPMI 1640 medium and put it on ice until use (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161229/20161229181131_1874.jpgFigure 1. Representative pictures of syringe preparation and surgery for BALF lavageWhen the mouse is fully anesthetized, typically within 2 min, immobilize it on a piece of polystyrene foam with absorbent pad on top by pinning each limb with a 25 G x 5/8 needle.Use a spray bottle filled with 70% ethanol to wet the fur of the mouse.Cut open the skin covering the abdominal and thoracic cavities through to the lower jaw. Use scissors to remove the tissue from the neck and expose the trachea.Use tweezers to separate the trachea from the underlying tissue and place a 200 μl tip under the trachea.Use a razor to cut through ½ of the trachea. Insert the 1 ml syringe with 20 G x 1 needle into the incision. Lavage for 4 times with complete RPMI 1640 medium. Collect the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in a 15 ml conical tube on ice. Typically 3-3.5 ml of BALF is recovered (Figure 1).Spin down cells for 5 min at 400 x g at 4 °C in a bucket tabletop centrifuge and resuspend the cells in 1 ml of ice cold FACS buffer (see Note 5).Sacrifice the mouse and harvest cells from lung (see Video 4)<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 4. Perfusing and harvesting lungs for cellular analysis  After collection of BALF, cutting open the abdominal cavity to expose the underside of the diaphragm.",
    "Cut through the diaphragm with scissors and then remove the ribcage to fully expose the heart and lung.Fill a 10 ml syringe with ice cold sterile DPBS and attach a 25 G x 5/8 needle. Insert the needle into the left ventricle of the heart and smoothly dispense 5 ml of DPBS into the heart. In the meantime, use tweezers to break the right atria to allow blood to drain from circulation. Remove the needle from the left ventricle and insert it into the right ventricle to directly perfuse the lung with the remaining 5 ml of DPBS. (see Note 6)Cut the heart away from the lung and then remove the lung from the thoracic cavity after cutting the trachea and any remaining connective tissue.Place the lung into the well of a 12 well tissue culture plate filled with 2.5 ml of DPBS on ice. Rinse the lung with DPBS and transfer it into another well without DPBS. Mince the lungs into very fine pieces using scissors.Transfer minced lung with a 2.5 ml transfer pipette to 5 ml of digestion buffer in a 15 ml conical tube.Place tubes on a rocker and gently rotate at room temperature for 30 min in the dark.Place a 70 µm cell strainer into a 60 x 15 mm tissue culture dish.Transfer lung tissue in digestion buffer to the cell strainer using a 2.5 ml transfer pipette. Gently press and dissociate tissue through strainer with the flat end of a 3 ml syringe plunger. Process tissues until there is only connective tissue remaining on the strainer and rinse the strainer with complete RPMI 1640 medium. Transfer the resulting suspension to a 50 ml conical tube.Spin down lung cells for 5 min at 400 x g at 4 °C in a bucket tabletop centrifuge.",
    "Pour off supernatant and resuspend the cells in 3 ml of ACK buffer for 1 min to lyse the remaining red blood cells. Neutralize the ACK buffer with 30 ml of ice cold DPBS.Spin down the cells for 5 min at 400 x g at 4 °C and resuspend the cells in 5 ml of ice cold FACS buffer. Cell stainingCount the cells from BALF and lung using a hemocytometer in the presence of trypan blue. Spin down lung cells for 5 min at 400 x g at 4 °C and resuspend the cells in FACS buffer at 1 million cells per 50 µl. Spin down cells in the BALF for 5 min at 400 x g at 4 °C. Since much fewer cells are recovered from airway, resuspend 1-5 x 105 cells per 50 μl FACS buffer as needed.Dilute 0.25 μg CD4-FITC and 0.1 μg CD16/32 antibodies in 50 μl FACS buffer (see Note 4). Gently mix 50 μl cells and 50 μl antibodies together in a FACS tube.Incubate the cells in the dark for 15 min at 4 °C.Wash the cells once with 2 ml of FACS buffer at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 100 µl FACS buffer.Pass the cells through a 70 µm cell strainer into new FACS tubes using a pipetman. Acquire FACS data using a flow cytometer and analyze data using Flowjo software (Figure 2).

Gating strategy to distinguish CD4+ T cells in the airway, parenchyma and pulmonary vasculature. To localize memory CD4+ T cells in the respiratory tract, 0.25 μg of fluorochrome-conjugated CD45 and 0.5 μg of fluorochrome-conjugated CD90.2 antibody were injected into a SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein-experienced mouse by i.n. and i.v. routes, respectively.",
    "Cells in the airway and lung were then harvested, stained and collected as described in Experimental Procedures and analysis using Flowjo software. A. CD4+ T cells in the airway: CD4+CD45+CD90.2-. B. CD4+ T cells in the parenchyma: CD4+CD45-CD90.2-. CD4+ T cells in the vasculature: CD4+CD45-CD90.2+. Data are representative of 10 independent experiments. (Zhao et al., 2016)"
