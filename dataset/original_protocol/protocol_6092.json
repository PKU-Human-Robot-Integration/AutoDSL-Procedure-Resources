    "Extraction of total protein from rice stemsChill the mortar and pestle with liquid nitrogen and divide 30 g of fresh or -80 °C frozen stem samples into 4 parts of 7.5 g each for convenience and freeze in liquid nitrogen. Take each part of sample, cut the tissue into small pieces of about 1-2 cm long with pre-chilled scissors in a pre-chilled mortar.Grind the tissue to a fine powder by using mortar and pestle using liquid nitrogen. Collect the powder in a 50 ml centrifuge tube with the help of an ice-chilled spatula and place it in liquid nitrogen. Repeat the same for the remaining sample.Add 45 ml of extraction buffer to each centrifuge tube and invert the tubes to homogenize. Place the centrifuge tubes on a rocker at 4 °C for 1 h with a set speed of 50 rockings per min. Centrifuge for 45 min at 7,177 x g, 4 °C.Filter the supernatant through Whatman filter paper to a fresh autoclaved conical flask.Transfer the filtrate into 10 cm long dialysis bags and dialyze overnight in 3 L of dialysis buffer at 4 °C on a stirrer at 120 rpm.The dialyzed protein sample is collected and used for purification of laccases.Purification of laccases from crude protein extractSlowly load the econo-column with concanavalin-A beads using a cut 1 ml pipette tip. Allowed it to settle at the base of the column. Length of separation column was 1.5 cm x 2.5 cm (diameter x length).Wash the column with 4 column volume (CV) of wash buffer. A flow rate of 1 ml/min was maintained throughout the procedure using a peristaltic pump.Pre-equilibrate the column with 4 CV of equilibration buffer.Pass the total crude protein sample through the walls of column slowly without disturbing using a 1 ml pipette.",
    "Wash the column with 3 CV of wash buffer to wash the unbound protein.Elute laccases with 9 ml of 50 mM mannose in three elutions of 3 ml each.Load the protein concentrators with purified laccase and centrifuge at 7,177 x g, 4 °C to concentrate the eluted protein to up to 200 μl.Wash the column with 3 CV of equilibration buffer and then with Milli-Q-filtered water.Regenerate the column by passing regeneration buffer A and B alternatively for 4 times.Pass 1 CV of storage buffer through the column and store the beads in storage buffer at 4 °C.Obtained purified laccases can be used for in-gel staining (Swetha et al., 2018). Perform standard mass-spectrometry (LC-MS) using cut prominent bands around 50-65 kDa from native gel to confirm the presence of laccases and to rule out contamination from peroxidases (as plant peroxidases range from 40-50 kDa).Load concentrated protein in about 30 μl onto 12% SDS gel and subject to electrophoresis in TGS buffer for 2 h at 80 V.Stain the gel with CBB overnight and then destain for 4 h in destaining solution at room temperature.In-gel staining of purified laccasesSample preparation was done by adding 8 μl of native gel sample loading dye (6x) to the concentrated protein of about 30 μl.Load the protein sample onto a 12% native gel and subject to electrophoresis in TG buffer for 2 h at 80 V and 4 °C.Wash the gel with water 3 to 4 times and then stain the gel with 30 ml of 5 mM 4-hydroxyindole for 2 h."
