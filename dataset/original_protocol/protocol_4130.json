    "Maintain cells under standard tissue culture conditions at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Keep cell density below 1 x 106/ml.  Caution: Prior to analysis cell should be kept for several hours (min 12 h) in fresh medium to avoid potential activation of autophagy due to nutrients exhaustion. Generally culture medium contains autophagy affecting substances: amino acids, glucose, growth factors, hormones etc. Take care when comparing autophagic flux in different conditions to normalize for all the necessary factors. Normalize also for the solvent used when analysing the effect of different substances on autophagy – for example DMSO, ethanol etc. might affect autopagic flux.    Incubate the cells for the desired time and under the conditions of interest. Negative control subjected to vehicle treatment should be included.  Caution: When analysing prolonged periods of time and/or under conditions potentially affecting cells numbers or viability, differences in nutrient consumption and therefore abundance might occur and influence your results as autophagic activity is highly related to the nutritional status.    Positive control [rapamycin (1-5 µmol/L), PP242 (1-5 µmol/L), Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution containing 6 mmol/L glucose (starvation medium)] and negative control [3-methyladenine (3-MA) (3-10 mmol/L), wortmannin (30-100 nmol/L), LY294002 (7-20 µmol/L), nocodazole (12-50 µmol/L), vinblastine (12-50 µmol/L), ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) (10-20 mmol/L), hydrohychloroquine (HCQ) or chloroquine (CQ) (5-10 µmol/L)] may be also included.    Upon completion of treatment period, wash the cells with DPBS. For suspension cells use centrifugation, for adherent cells wash as they are adherent (do not trypsinize).   Resuspend suspension cells, or add to adherent cells Cyto-ID Green containing indicator free cell culture medium, containing 5% FBS. Suggested cell density for staining stage is 105 to 106 cells/ml. Suggested Cyto-ID Green concentration is 1 μl of Cyto-ID Green Detection Reagent in 1 ml cell culture medium.",
    "Mix well and incubate for 30 min under standard tissue culture conditions at 37 ºC, 5% CO2 in the dark.    At the end of staining procedure, wash away the Cyto-ID containing medium. Wash once more with DPBS and resuspend suspension cells or trypsinize, wash and resuspend adherent cells in ice cold DPBS containing 2% FBS.  Note: Caution upon completion of staining step whenever possible keep always on ice and in the dark.    Analyze samples using flow cytometer and plot data of cell counts as FITC (FL1) fluorescence intensity. Table 1 may be used to facilitate the interpretation of the results.  Table 1.

Caution: The calculation of ΔMFI Cyto-ID requires both +CQ/NH4Cl and -CQ/NH4Cl condition for each individual sample!   Suggested incubation with ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) (10–20 mmol/L) or chloroquine (CQ) (5–10 µmol/L) is 5 h.   (Activator): autophagy induction [rapamycin (1-5 µmol/L), PP242 (1-5 µmol/L) or starvation medium]. Suggested incubation 5 h. (Caution: The concentration of the activator should be established for the particular cell type.)   Analysis of unknown substance X should include co incubation with one or more activators. Table 1 illustrates three possible scenarios. a) Scenario (I) unknown substance X does not impact cellular autophagic activity; b) Scenario (II) X is an activator; c) Scenario (III) X is an inhibitor of autophagy.    Caution: Although considered the most accurate sensitive and reliable method for analysis of autophygic flux, flow cytometry determination of Cyto-ID stained cells should be combined with alternative methods with non overlapping limitations such as electron microscopy (EM) fluorescence microscopy (FM), western blotting (WB) etc.    Example data:  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140401/20140401005330_0940.jpg Figure 1.
