  "procedures": [
    "1. Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-g-chondroitin Sulfate Synthesis\nPrior to the synthesis of the bioadhesive hydrogel, purify N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm) monomer and methacrylate chondroitin sulfate (CS).\n\t\nWeigh out at least 10 g of NIPAAm and dissolve the monomer in 400 ml of n-hexane at 60 °C. Stir the container periodically until complete dissolution. Recrystallize the solution in a -20 °C freezer for 24 hr.\nRemove the crystallized monomer from the container and vacuum filter the n-hexane using a Buchner funnel. Place the monomer in a vacuum oven at RT for 24 hr to remove any remaining n-hexane. Store the monomer in a -20 °C freezer for later use (see step 1.2).\nWeigh out and dissolve 2.0 g of chondroitin sulfate in 8.0 ml of deionized water. Gently heat the solution to 60 °C.\nAdjust the pH of the solution to 10 using approximately 10 to 40 µl of 50% (w/w) NaOH.\nAdd 0.298 ml of methacrylic anhydride (MA). Reflux for 24 hr, while stirring at 60 °C.\nPour 400 ml of acetone solution into a jar and chill O/N in a -20 °C freezer.\nAfter 24 hr have elapsed, slowly pour the entire methacrylated CS (mCS) solution into 400 ml of cold acetone, while stirring with a magnetic stir bar.\nRemove the mCS from the acetone and place the precipitate into a vacuum oven. Perform this step quickly to maintain an intact and cohesive state for mCS. Allow the residual acetone to evaporate under vacuum for at least 24 hr.\nCo-dissolve 10 g of purified NIPAAm and 2.209 g of mCS in 232 ml of deionized water.\nPurge the solution of oxygen by using inert nitrogen gas. Maintain a vigorous, yet low gas flow rate to prevent the solution from bubbling over for 15 min.",
    "Continue purging the solution with nitrogen gas and add 0.976 ml of tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED).\nNext, initiate the polymerization reaction by mixing 97.6 mg of ammonium persulfate (APS).\nMix the solution for approximately 20 sec and quickly seal the solution to prevent any air from entering the vessel. Allow the solution to polymerize under fluorescent light for 24 hr.\nAfter 24 hr, place the reaction vessel into a 37 °C oven. Allow the hydrogel to transition from a liquid to a gel-like state. Submerge the polymerized hydrogel in 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for a total of 7 days to allow for diffusion of unreacted monomer out of the hydrogel.\nUsing a pair of scissors, cut the hydrogel into several small pieces, no greater than 5 cm in diameter. To prevent the hydrogel from transitioning from a gel-like state to a liquid, dice the polymer within the 37 °C PBS solution. Transfer the portions into 50 ml conical tubes.\nPrepare the samples for lyophilization by wrapping the tops of the tubes with Kimwipes and rubber bands. Freeze the tubes at -70 °C for 1 to 2 hr.\nPlace the conical tubes on the freeze dryer to remove all of the water from the hydrogel. Before operating, the freeze dryer needs to reach a temperature and pressure of approximately -40 °C and 0.04 mbar, respectively. A minimum of 7 days is required for complete drying.\nGrind the freeze dried polymer into a fine powder and store in a 4 °C refrigerator for later use (see step 3.1).\n2. Calcium-alginate Crosslinked Microparticle Synthesis\nPrepare a 2% (w/v) alginate solution by dissolving 400 mg in 20 ml of deionized water. Heat the solution to approximately 60 °C to facilitate dissolution.",
    "Prepare a 2% (w/v) calcium chloride solution by adding 400 mg to 20 ml of deionized water.\nCreate an oil in water mixture by combining 100 ml of canola oil, 1.0 ml of Tween 20, and 20 ml of 2% (w/v) alginate. Emulsify the mixture for 10 min with a homogenizer at 15,000 rpm. Additionally, mix with a magnetic stir bar at 200 rpm or 2,000 rpm to create large or small microparticles, respectively.\nAspirate the 2% (w/v) calcium chloride solution using a syringe with an 18 G needle tip. Slowly add the calcium chloride drop-wise into the emulsion.\nOnce the 20 ml of calcium chloride have been exhausted, allow the microparticles within the emulsion to crosslink for 10 min.\nEvenly distribute the batch of microparticles into capped 50 ml conical tubes and centrifuge to a force of 1,400 x g for 2 min to remove the initial layer of canola oil.\nConsecutively wash, vortex, and centrifuge the microparticles with isopropanol a total of three times at 1,400 g for 2 min to remove any residual canola oil. Discard the isopropanol supernatant after each centrifugation step and wash with fresh isopropanol.\nOnce the oil has been removed, repeat the washing procedure three additional times with deionized water to remove any residual isopropanol. Discard the deionized water supernatant after each centrifugation step and wash with fresh deionized water. Remove approximately 100 mg of wet microparticles and store in a vial. The wet microparticles will be used to measure the average diameter of the batch by light microscopy.",
    "Using light microscopy, disperse a small sample of wet microparticles in deionized water on a microscope slide. Depending on the size of the microparticles, use a 10X or 20X objective, and adjust the numerical aperture until the particles come into focus. Ensure that the microscope is calibrated for the correct objective and adjust the brightness of the light source as needed. Use a line tool to measure the longest diameter of 50 random alginate microparticles and obtain an average size for the batch.\nPrepare the microparticles for lyophilization by wrapping them with Kimwipes and securing them with rubber bands. Freeze the microparticles at -70 °C for 1 hr.\nPlace the microparticles on the lyophilizer and allow the sample to dry for at least 24 hr. Grind the freeze dried microparticles into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle and store in a 4 °C refrigerator for later use (see step 3.3).\n3. Preparation of the Adhesives\nUsing the freeze-dried polymer powder, create a 5% (w/v) PNIPAAm-g-CS solution by dissolving 50 mg of hydrogel powder in 1 ml of 1x PBS.\nMix the solution using a vortex and chill in a refrigerator at 4 °C for 24 hr.\nOnce the viscous solution forms, create a homogenous composite by adding 25 or 50 mg of freeze dried alginate microparticles to the hydrogel solution and vortex. Store the composite in a refrigerator at 4 °C for later use (see steps 4.3 and 4.8).\n4. Bioadhesive Mechanical Tensile Tests\nPrior to performing tensile tests, extract cartilage substrate from a porcine ear.\n\t\nDefrost a porcine ear in a warm 0.9% (w/v) NaCl solution; this will help to loosen the tissue.",
    "Using a scalpel, isolate and section off a flat, rectangular area by cutting vertically though the epidermal layer, subcutaneous tissue, and cartilage. Avoid cutting the curved ridges of the porcine ear.\nSeparate the epidermal layer of skin from the cartilage by cutting parallel through the subcutaneous tissue. The cartilage is a hard, white tissue found beneath the porcine skin.\nCarefully scrape the subcutaneous tissue that is attached to the cartilage with the side of the scalpel. Avoid cutting into the cartilage tissue with the scalpel blade.\nEnsure that only one side of the cartilage is exposed and flat during tensile testing. If necessary, flatten the cartilage by cutting off the uneven skin on the underside.\nCut the cartilage tissue into several pieces with dimensions of 1 cm x 1 cm. Store the cartilage tissue in conical tubes filled with 0.9% (w/v) NaCl solution in a -20 °C freezer.\nPrepare 2.0 L of 0.9% (w/v) NaCl solution. Pre-heat the saline solution to 37 °C. The temperature of this solution will need to be maintained throughout testing.\nDefrost the frozen cartilage. Keep both the porcine cartilage and the hydrogel samples in a Styrofoam container with ice packs.\nAttach the force gauge to the arm of the test stand. Place a hotplate on top of the force stand and set the temperature to 50 °C.\nAffix a 1 cm x 1 cm piece of cartilage to the stainless steel block with cyanoacrylate glue and a pair of tweezers. Glue an additional piece of cartilage to the Delrin cylinder and attach the cylinder to the force gauge. It is very important that both cartilage surfaces face each other and contact the hydrogel.",
    "Place the Plexiglas water bath on top of the hot plate and insert the stainless steel block with the cartilage substrate inside the bath.\nLower the arm of the test stand and align both cartilage substrates with one another. Raise the arm and leave enough room to apply the hydrogel.\nWith a positive displacement pipette, dispense 200 µl of the bioadhesive hydrogel to the bottom piece of cartilage.\nLower the arm of the force stand at 1 mm/min until the hydrogel contacts the upper piece of cartilage and exerts a preload force of 0.001 N.\nPour the 37 °C saline solution into the bath until the volume reaches the designated water level. Check the temperature of the solution with a thermocouple.\nAllow the hydrogel to set for a total of 5 minutes. Once the gel has solidified, raise the arm at a speed of 2 mm/min. The test is completed once the bioadhesive detaches from the cartilage substrate or when a significant drop in force occurs, signaling failure.\nCollect the recorded data and raise the arm of the test stand. Remove the Delrin cylinder from the force gauge. Pour the saline solution into its previous container and reheat to 37 °C.\nCalculate stresses by subtracting the force exerted by the polymer from the buoyant force of a \"blank\", the Delrin attachment with no cartilage or adhesive, raised at the same rate, and dividing by the bond area.\n5. Swelling Study of PNIPAAm-g-CS with Alginate Microparticles\nPrepare clean glass vials and label them appropriately with a time point, sample type, and sample number. The adhesives may also be created, as previously described. Prepare a total of five samples (n = 5) for each sample type per time point.\nPre-weigh all glass vials and record their initial mass at RT.",
    "Using a syringe, dispense approximately 0.4 ml of the prepared adhesive sample into each of the five vials. Repeat this step for each sample type across all tested time points.\nWeigh and record the mass of each vial with the adhesive sample type at RT.\nPre-warm an orbital incubator and 1 L of 1x PBS solution to 37 °C.\nOrganize all of the vials on a rack and insert the rack into the incubator. Allow the adhesives to transition from a liquid to a gel for approximately 5 to 10 min.\nAdd 5.0 ml of 1x PBS to each vial. Be sure to carefully add the PBS solution along the side of the vial to prevent the hydrogel disc from breaking apart.\nCap each vial to prevent evaporation of the PBS solution and maintain the internal temperature of the incubator at 37 °C. Each set of hydrogel discs will need to remain submerged in PBS for a designated length of time.\nOnce a 7 day time point has been reached, uncap the set of vials and remove the PBS solution from each vial. Weigh each vial with the adhesive sample again at RT.\n6. Qualitative Cell Viability Using a Live/Dead Assay\nBefore performing the Live/Dead assay with PNIPAAm-g-CS, grow human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK-293) to 80% confluence.\n\t\nQuick-thaw the frozen HEK-293 cell suspension by placing the cryovial in a 37 °C water bath, then centrifuge the cells at 400 x g at 4 °C for 5 min in a 15 ml conical tube.",
    "To make the first passage cell growth medium, combine in high glucose (4.5 g/L) Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) with heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) to a final concentration of 20% and the 100x penicillin-streptomycin solution (pen-strep) to a final concentration of 100 I.U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For all other passages, switch to DMEM with 10% FBS and 1x pen-strep.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 10 ml of growth medium and transfer the suspension into one 100 mm diameter petri dish. Evenly distribute the cells by gently tilting the dish front to back and left to right a few times each direction.\nCulture the cells in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. If necessary, change the medium every two days.\nWhen cells reach 80% confluency, replicate the culture into multiple dishes. Remove the medium from the plate.\nAdd 1 ml of 0.5% trypsin to the plate. Allow the plates to incubate at 37 °C for 10 min.

Increase the suspension volume of medium if the initial cell concentration is too high, and conversely decrease the volume if the concentration is too low, in order to preserve a target concentration of 1 x 106 cells/ml. Centrifuge the HEK-293 cells at 400 x g and resuspend the cell pellet in the corrected volume of media accordingly.\nGently vortex the cell suspension and evenly distribute the cell mix into four separate 15 ml conical tubes for the following test conditions: positive control monolayer, negative killed control in PNIPAAm-g-CS using 70% (v/v) methanol, HEK-293 cells encapsulated in PNIPAAm-g-CS, and HEK-293 cells encapsulated in PNIPAAm-g-CS with alginate microparticles.\nCreate positive control monolayers by pipetting multiple 300 µl volumes of the cell mix into a 24-well plate to generate 4-6 replicate samples.\nRemove the media from the conical tubes pertaining to the killed control, PNIPAAm-g-CS, and PNIPAAm-g-CS with alginate microparticles.\n\t\nCentrifuge the conical tubes for 5 minutes at 400 x g and remove the supernatant.",

Use the slide warmer to maintain well plate temperature and pipette 600 µl of pre-warmed media into each well. To further prevent the transitioning of the polymer to a liquid state, position a lamp with a fluorescent bulb above the dish to warm up the air above it.\nIncubate the cells for 5 days at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\nAfter five days have elapsed, prepare the Live/Dead dye mix using ethidium homodimer (EthD-1) and calcein AM.
