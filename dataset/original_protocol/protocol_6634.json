    "Cell lysate preparationGrow cultures to the desired optical density in the appropriate culture medium for the bacteria. Record the culture optical density for normalization. For optimal sample preparation, aim for 1010 bacteria or higher (e.g., 10 ml at 1 unit OD600, 50 ml at 0.2 units OD600). Samples can be scaled up but require more reagents and are more time-consuming.For statistical analysis, prepare and process samples in triplicates.Transfer the cultures to 50 ml conical tubes and harvest the cells at 3,000 x g for 15 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1.5 ml of its own media. Alternatively, pellets can be resuspended in PBS or Tris HCl buffers. Final volume is not critical, but lower volumes are preferred to shorten the number of washes required later (Figure 1A).Note: Resuspension media containing potassium (e.g., M63 minimal medium) can interfere with sacculi preparation as potassium salts react with SDS producing insoluble KDS. Transfer the samples to 15 ml conical tubes. The tubes must be suitable for boiling. Place a small stirring bar (magnet) per tube (Figure 1A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200923/20200923192200_5538.jpgFigure 1. Pipeline for peptidoglycan sample preparation. A. Lysate preparation: bacterial cultures are collected and SDS is added to the resuspended pellets, which are boiled and stirred to facilitate solubilization of all cell components except for the peptidoglycan sacculus. B. Sacculi are washed repeatedly with water and submitted to enzymatic treatment. Released muropeptides in the supernatant are injected in a chromatographic system. C. Mobile phase gradient applied during UPLC separation. D. Steps of the gradient separation of muropeptides by UPLC.Add 1.5 ml lysis buffer and place the tubes on a beaker with boiling water on a magnetic hot stirrer plate. Boil the samples for 30 min-2 h, then switch off the hot plate and let the lysate stir overnight.",
    "Cells will immediately lyse upon boiling in SDS, but longer stirring times are recommended for shearing the DNA (Figure 1A).Boiled lysates can be stored at room temperature for long time. Make sure the lid is tightly closed to avoid desiccation.Isolation of Gram-negative bacteria peptidoglycanTo completely remove SDS, perform several washes with water by centrifugation. Spin down the samples 10 min and 150,000 x g using 3 ml polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tubes. Use 20 °C or higher since SDS precipitates at low temperature. Fill the tubes with 3 ml lysate. Make sure the rotor is properly balanced. After centrifugation, all soluble compounds will remain in the supernatant. The resulting pellet is usually transparent and hard to distinguish. It is recommended to mark one side of the tube and use this as reference to locate the pellet (Figure 1B).Note: If during the washes a white precipitate (likely insoluble KDS) is observed, use Tris HCl 100 mM pH 8.0 buffer instead of water. Carefully discard the supernatant with a vacuum pump without removing the pellet. Resuspend the pellet in 900 µl MilliQ water and check for the presence of SDS by assessing the production of bubbles. If needed, add 2 ml MilliQ water, mix and centrifuge again. Repeat this wash step until SDS is completely removed (no bubbles are formed after the pellet is resuspended in water, typically 2-4 washes).To remove Braun’s lipoprotein or other PG-associated proteins, treat the washed sacculi with a protease. This step is optional, but highly recommended. Transfer the resuspended pellet (~900 µl) to 2 ml microtubes. Add 100 µl Tris HCl 1 M pH 8 buffer and 1 µl proteinase K 20 mg/ml. Incubate samples at 37 °C during 1 h. Stop the reaction by adding 110 µl SDS 10% (w/v) and boil for 5 min in water.",
    "Note: Proteinase K is a broad-spectrum serine protease used for removal of PG bound proteins such as Braun’s lipoprotein. The enzyme retains activity in SDS 1% (w/v). Some bacteria do not require Proteinase K treatment, but it is recommended for removal of other PG-associated proteins.Other proteases as chymotrypsin (EC 3.4.21.1) or trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4) can also be used. Let the sample cool down before transferring to the ultracentrifuge tubes again. Wash the Proteinase K digested sacculi by adding 2 ml MilliQ water. Mix and ultracentrifuge as described before. Carefully discard the supernatant and, after total removal of SDS, resuspend the pellet in 50-100 µl digestion buffer. The final volume is critical, since soluble muropeptides will remain in the soluble fraction after the muramidase digestion. Washed sacculi should be stored at 4 °C to avoid degradation or contamination. Storing the samples at -20 °C is not recommended since sacculi can break due to freeze/thaw processes.Muramidase digestionTransfer resuspended sacculi (50-100 µl) to 1.5 ml microtubes.Add 2 µl mutanolysin 1 mg/ml and let the reaction work 2-16 h at 37 °C. The reaction is almost complete after 2 h, but to ensure total digestion, let it proceed for longer times. To inactivate the enzyme, boil the samples for 5 min. Do not add any detergent to the sample.Centrifuge 15 min at room temperature and 20,000 x g in a benchtop centrifuge and transfer the supernatant to new 1.5 ml microtubes. This supernatant contains the soluble muropeptides released by the mutanolysin (Figure 1B). These samples are very stable and can be stored at 4 or -20 °C.Sample reductionNote: Sample reduction is optional but highly recommended. Digestion with mutanolysin produces a terminal reducing NAM.",
    "Sample reduction avoids the different anomeric configurations and the consequent appearance of two to four peaks per muropeptide in the PG profile, as the NAM is reduced to muramitol. Perform this procedure in a laminar flow cabinet. If no reduction is performed, adjust the sample pH to 2.0-4.0 with diluted orthophosphoric acid instead (0.25%, v/v).Add borate buffer to the sample to adjust pH to 8.5-9.0. For a 100 µl reaction, 15-20 µl borate buffer are typically used. Check pH using indicator strips: take 0.5 µl sample and drop on the indicator strip. Check the color/pH on the reference table. Do not leave samples at high pH for too long, since it leads to alkaline β-elimination (Tipper, 1968).Add 20 µl freshly prepared NaBH4 2 M and let the sample reduce at room temperature for 30 min. This reaction produces H2 and bubbles are accumulated, do not close the tube lids to prevent gas accumulation.Adjust sample pH to 2.0-4.0 with orthophosphoric acid 25% (v/v). Addition of the acid will cause a violent reaction and sudden bubble formation. First add 4 µl and check the pH with the appropriate indicator strip as indicated before. If needed, carefully add acid µl by µl to ensure the sample reaches the desired pH.Spin the tubes for 1 min at maximum speed to ensure maximum sample recovery. Transfer the samples to a 96-well V-shaped-bottom microplate. Seal the plate using a pierceable adhesive seal. Samples can be stored long-term at -20 °C. Insoluble precipitates might form and if observed, filter the samples prior to injection in the UPLC.UPLC separationNote: settings will depend on the software, model and manufacturer of the UPLC. For muropeptide profiling, reverse-phase (RP) columns, typically C18-bonded silicas that are able to retain and separate medium-polar and non-polar metabolites provide a good separation pattern.",
    "For RPLC, maximum retention of analytes is ensured by loading samples onto the column using solvents of low eluotropic strength (i.e., composed mainly or entirely of water). Elution of retained metabolites is accomplished using a gradient of increasing acetonitrile content.Set the column temperature to 45 °C.Prepare mobile phases and refill bottles A and B with organic buffer A [formic acid 0.1% (v/v)] and organic buffer B [formic acid 0.1% (v/v) in acetonitrile] respectively. Purge pumps and tubes according to the UPLC system instructions.Equilibrate the column with organic buffer A, flow 0.25 ml/min until pressure is stabilized.Using the system auto-sampler, inject 10 µl sample.Perform the LC run using the gradient described in Figures 1C and 1D and measure absorbance at 204 nm.Run a blank injection to monitor and subtract the baseline.TroubleshootingCarefully control parameters such as flow rate and column temperature following the manufacturers indications to ensure repeatability of the separations. Typically, ~2,000 samples can be injected in a chromatographic column before separation efficiency is lost, peaks degrade and retention times change. If the chromatogram shows poor peak shapes, this is indicative of column degradation or sample overloading. To solve this problem, dilute the sample or improve sample preparation. If the problem persists, consider cleaning or replacing the column.The injection volume can be modified depending on the sample concentration:For concentrated samples (e.g., PG from large starting cultures), inject less volume, ensuring the system is working within its detection limits.If there are no or few peaks or the signal is too low, increase the injection, concentrate the sample using a Speedvac concentrator or prepare new sample by resuspending the washed sacculi in a lower volume prior to mutanolysin digestion.Changes in the retention time can be due to improper sample pH or presence of detergent (SDS) in the sample.",
    "When sample pH is greater than 5, it results in shifted chromatograms. Adjust pH with orthophosphoric acid 25% (v/v) and rerun the sample. If there is detergent in the sample, either prepare new sample increasing the amount of washing steps or wash the column after each run to get rid of the retained detergent.Improper sample reduction results in profiles with altered retention times. Repeat the sample preparation adding an excess of NaBH4.Contamination with other components or short re-equilibration time between runs also contribute to the appearance of ghost peaks.When sample concentration is low, the baseline drift and noise become more evident. Run a blank injection with water and subtract the baseline during the data processing."
