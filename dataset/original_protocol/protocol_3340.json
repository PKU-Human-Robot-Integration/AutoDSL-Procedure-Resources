    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\n      The protocol below describes the specific steps needed to study the\n      binding of 10 compounds to a protein of interest. Each compound is tested\n      in triplicate at four concentrations (20, 10, 5, and 2.5 μM). We also use\n      this general protocol to study interactions with additives other than\n      compounds, such as metal co-factors or peptides. See\n      Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] for a simplified schematic of this protocol.\n      See\n      Figure S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3107-Mmc1.pdf]\n      for a plate-view map of the full experiment and for plate layout.\n    \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3107-Fig2.jpg\n          Figure 2. Schematic of step-by-step procedure for testing the binding\n          of one small molecule by DSF\n        \n          The step-by-step protocol describes the testing of ten compounds by\n          DSF; for simplicity, only one compound is represented in this\n          schematic. Steps 1–3: First, 4× solutions of compound and protein are\n          prepared and combined in a 1:1 ratio. See “Combine protein and\n          additives” in text. A complementary no-protein control, containing\n          buffer and compound, is also prepared at this step. Step 4. Next, a 2×\n          solution of DSF dye is prepared in buffer. See “make concentrated dye solution[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2]” in main text. Steps 5 and 6: The dye solution is then combined in a\n          1:1 ratio with the protein+compound samples and no protein controls.\n          Step 6: These final samples are then distributed into the wells of a\n          qPCR plate.\n        \nCombine protein and compounds\nTiming: 30–60 min\n    \n      We begin by creating 4× working solutions of both protein and compounds.\n      These 4× solutions are then mixed in equal volumes, creating 2× solutions\n      containing both protein and compound, and incubated. We prepare and\n      incubate these solutions in PCR strip tubes.\n    \n      Combining protein and additives as a first step allows this solution to\n      incubate in the absence of dye. This dye-free incubation can reduce",
    "possible interference of the DSF dye with the folded protein and it\n      minimizes competition between dye and compound for binding to the folded\n      protein. This step also minimizes other artifacts, such as, dye-assisted\n      binding of otherwise non-binding compounds,16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]\n      and dye-induced compound aggregation (see\n      troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\n    \nNote: For experiments testing more than 5\n      to 10 conditions, we recommend completing all required calculations before\n      beginning experimental set-up. This step is particularly helpful to\n      identify how much excess volume should be added to the starting solutions\n      to account for pipetting loss in consecutive dilution and transfer steps\n      (e.g., see steps 3d and 4a, 7d, and 9 below).\n    \nNote: In this sample experiment, each\n      compound is tested at four concentrations: 20, 10, 5, and 2.5 μM, and each\n      condition is tested in triplicate. The compound stock solution is 10 mM.\n      The final protein concentration is 1 μM, and the stock protein\n      concentration is 100 μM.\n    \n        Prepare 10 mL of buffer containing 1% DMSO. This buffer is used in all\n        subsequent steps of the protocol.\n      \nNote: When working with small molecules,\n      we include 1% DMSO in the buffer to improve the solubility of both\n      compounds and DSF dye (see\n      troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] for more information on\n      additive and dye solubility in DSF experiments). In experiments where\n      solubility is a major concern, such as high throughput screening or when\n      an additive is known to be relatively insoluble, we also include 0.01%\n      Triton X-100.17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17],18[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]\n        Prepare 4× solutions of each compound at each concentration to be tested\n        (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], Step 1) and set aside.\n        \n            Calculate the number of wells required for each compound at each\n            concentration.\n            \n1\nconcentration\n×\n3\nreplicates\n=\n3\nwells\nper\ncompound\nat\neach\nconcentration\nInclude\na\nno\n−\nprotein\ncontrol\nfor\nevery\ntested\ncondition\n:\n3\nwells\nwith\nprotein\n+\n3\nwells\nwithout\nprotein",

For step 9, we repeatedly fit three matrix pipette tips into the\n      2 mL microcentrifuge tube, draw up the maximum allowable volume, and\n      multi-dispense 18 μL of dye into the top edge of each PCR strip tube (Figure S3[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3107-Mmc1.pdf]), carefully avoiding any cross-contamination between PCR strip tubes,\n      and ensuring the full volume of dye combines with the protein and compound\n      solution in each tube. For step 10, we program the pipette to first mix\n      the solution by slowly pipetting 10 μL up and down 5 times, followed by a\n      step to draw up 33 μL of solution, and then dispense 10 μL of solution\n      three times.\n    \nNote: When pipetting small volumes into\n      wells (e.g., 2–5 μL), we pipette each component onto opposing\n      vertical sides of each well, and then spin the plate down to settle and\n      mix the components into the bottom of each well (Figure S3[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3107-Mmc1.pdf]).
