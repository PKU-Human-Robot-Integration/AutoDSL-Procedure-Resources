    "Preparation of the lipid filmClean the Hamilton syringes by flushing them five times with chloroform:methanol (1:1, volume/volume) under a fume hood.Note: Chloroform is a hazardous solvent. Conduct all work in a fume hood, while wearing appropriate personal protective equipment. Using Hamilton syringes, transfer 200 µL of a 25 mg mL-1 DOPC stock solution (see Recipe 9) into a round bottom glass tube placed on ice.Note: Avoid any use of plasticware when handling organic solvents. Evaporate the organic solvent at room temperature (RT) under in a rotary evaporator at the reduced pressure of 250 mbar overnight, followed by evaporation at ~10 mbar for 15 min, see Figure 1.The dried lipid film can be stored at -20 °C.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4552/bioprotoc-12-22-4552-g001.jpgFigure 1. Scheme of lipid film preparation. (A) The desired amount of lipid (I) in chloroform is transferred to a glass tube. Subsequently, the solvent is evaporated in a rotary evaporator under the reduced pressure of 250 mbar overnight (ON), resulting in a thin lipid film on the sides of the glass tube (II). (B) The glass tube containing the desired lipids in chloroform is connected to the rotary evaporator.Preparation of calcein-loaded LUVsAdd 1 mL of loading buffer (see Recipe 10) and a 3-mm glass bead to the lipid film. Vortex for 10 min (see Figure 2A).Transfer the lipid suspension to a new glass tube, without the glass bead.Subject the lipid suspension to five freeze-thaw cycles by placing the tube alternatively into liquid nitrogen for 10 min for freezing and in a water bath at 50 °C for 5 min for thawing.Note: Wear a face shield and insulating gloves when handling liquid nitrogen. Use glass tubes with high thermal shock resistance.",
    "Assemble the mini-extruder, consisting of two Hamilton glass syringes, a Teflon cylinder with two drain discs, and a 200-nm polycarbonate membrane in between them, see Figure 2B.Note: We routinely use polycarbonate membranes of 200-nm pore size and perform the extrusion at RT. However, for lipids containing saturated, long-chain fatty acids, which have a high lipid phase transition temperature (Tm), the extruder needs to be heated up to a temperature 5–10 °C above the Tm. This temperature can vary greatly between lipid formulations. A useful table of lipid phase transition temperatures is provided by the manufacturer at https://avantilipids.com/tech-support/physical-properties/phase-transition-temps/[href=https://avantilipids.com/tech-support/physical-properties/phase-transition-temps/].Check the tightness of the mini-extruder by flushing with 1 mL of buffer A (see Recipe 1), i.e., pass back and forth between the syringes three to four times. Continue only if the buffer volume stays the same for each passing.Fill one Hamilton glass syringe with ~1 mL of lipid/calcein solution, and place the filled syringe into one end of the mini-extruder.Carefully place an empty syringe into the opposite end of the mini-extruder. The plunger of the empty syringe should be depressed completely into the syringe barrel.Extrude lipid suspension by passing through the filters a minimum of 11 times, starting in syringe 1 and finishing in syringe 2.Note: The number of passages through the extruder needs to be uneven so that the final liposome sample is collected in syringe 2, which is uncontaminated by residual multilamellar vesicles that have never passed the extruder. Inject the final lipid solution into a 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube, and store it at 4 °C.Note: Size distribution of the resulting liposomal preparations can be evaluated by dynamic light scattering. When using polycarbonate membranes of 200-nm pore size, we typically obtain a preparation with an hydrodynamic diameter in the range of 168.5 ± 2.5 nm.",
    "Immediately wash all parts of the extruders with Milli-Q water, then with 70% ethanol, and dry it thoroughly before storing. Solvent-rinse syringes before storing. When extruding additional vesicles, disassemble and clean all parts of the extruder, and replace the membrane and filter supports.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4552/bioprotoc-12-22-4552-g002.jpgFigure 2. Scheme for preparation of calcein-loaded LUVs. (A) The dry lipid film is hydrated in a loading buffer containing the fluorescent dye calcein (step I) by vortexing for 10 min (step II). The lipid suspension (step III) is subjected to five freeze-thaw cycles using liquid nitrogen (-196 °C, step IV) and a water bath at 50 °C (step V). Next, the suspension is passed 11 times through 0.2-μm nucleopore polycarbonate membranes mounted in a mini-extruder to form LUVs (step VI). (B) Assembly of mini-extruder. Use four filter supports, two on each side. Use two polycarbonate membranes, with blank sides towards each other. Further directions and guidance on proper extruder assembly are provided on the manufacturer’s web site (https://avantilipids.com/divisions/equipment-products/mini-extruder-assembly-instructions[href=https://avantilipids.com/divisions/equipment-products/mini-extruder-assembly-instructions]; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6WPvGv5eY[href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6WPvGv5eY]).Separation of calcein-loaded LUVs from free dyePrepare two G50 columns, using 2-mL plastic syringes without a plunger, and filter supports as a stopper, see Figure 3A.Place the syringes into disposable 15-mL reaction tubes, add 3 mL of Sephadex G50 fine slurry (see Recipe 4) using a Pasteur pipette, centrifuge at 180 × g for 5 min, and transfer the columns to a new 15-mL reaction tube.Load the sample on the top of one of the G50 columns.Centrifuge at 180 × g and RT for 5 min (see Figure 3B).Transfer the eluate to the top of the second G50 column.Centrifuge again at 180 × g and RT for 5 min (see Figure 3C).",
    "Note: Repeat the size exclusion chromatography of the eluate with a new G50 column, if you do not achieve a separation of the free dye (intense yellow part of the column) from the vesicles (colorless lower part of the column). Collect the eluate containing the calcein-loaded LUVs in a new 15-mL Falcon tube.Cover the tube with aluminum foil.Note: Calcein-loaded LUVs could be stored at 4 °C in the dark until the next day. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4552/bioprotoc-12-22-4552-g003.jpgFigure 3. Separation of calcein-loaded LUVs by size exclusion chromatography. (A) For size exclusion chromatography, two filter supports are placed as a stopper in a 3-mL plastic syringe without a plunger, and 3 mL of Sephadex G50 fine slurry is added. (B) Calcein-loaded LUVs are separated from free calcein during the size-exclusion chromatography. The LUVs will elute with the void volume in the early fractions, whereas the non-liposome-associated calcein will elute in later fractions. (C) Image showing a G50 filtration column after the filtration with the trapped free calcein. Free calcein is in the first G50 filtration column after the first separation. After the next separation, the second G50 filtration column contains no free calcein.Monitoring ion permeabilityCool buffer A (see Recipe 1), the cuvette, and the calcein-loaded LUV at 10 °C (e.g., by storing in a fridge at 10 °C).Note: To suppress the rate of uncatalyzed transport in the absence of the ionophore, the assay is performed at 10 °C. Liposomes of other lipid compositions might exhibit lower passive permeability and thus allow higher assay temperatures. Turn on the fluorometer and set up the parameters as follows: excitation wavelength 480 nm, emission wavelength 520 nm, and measurement duration approximately 10 min, with 1 s resolution. Adjust slits as necessary; a bandpass of 3 nm is usually sufficient.",
    "Cool down the sample holder of the fluorometer to 10 °C.Note: We use Peltier-based temperature control with magnetic stirring, providing temperature stability and full control software during the measurements. Add 20 µL of calcein-loaded LUV in the fluorometer cuvette, and top up to 2 mL using precooled buffer.For probing the impact of ionophores on ion permeability, add 1 µL of ionophore (see Recipe 6, final concentration 3 µM) into the cuvette, and incubate in the fridge for a further 5 min.As a control for quenching of calcein in the presence of ions, prepare one sample by adding 10–20 µL of 20% Triton X-100 (see Recipe 11) into a cuvette, and incubate in the fridge for 5 min.Introduce the cuvette into the fluorometer (remember to include the magnetic stir bar), and start monitoring the emission intensity.Wait until fluorescence is stable (90 s).Measure the fluorescence intensity. After 1.5 min, add 3 µM CuCl2 (3 µL of 2 mM CuCl2, see Recipe 3), and record the fluorescence for another 8.5 min.Note: To ensure your setting and the calcein-loaded LUVs are working properly, run an excitation scan from 450 to 500 nm (emission 520 nm) and an emission scan from 500 to 550 nm (excitation 480 nm) at the start of the measurements. For calcein, the excitation and emission maxima should be at 480 nm and 520 nm, respectively (see Figure 4). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4552/bioprotoc-12-22-4552-g004.jpgFigure 4. Excitation and emission scans of the calcein-loaded LUVs were measured using a fluorometer. In the fluorometer cuvette, add 20 µL of calcein-loaded LUVs, and fill up to 2 mL using precooled buffer A. An excitation scan (black trace) was performed from 450–500 nm (emission 520 nm, slit 3 nm) and an emission scan (grey trace) from 500–550 nm (excitation 480 nm, slit 3 nm)."
