    "All animal procedures were approved by the David H. Murdock Research Institute IACUC located on the North Carolina Research Campus (NCRC), under protocol 14-017, Characterization of a nonhuman primate model of diabetes and prediabetes/insulin resistance and efficacy of therapeutics to improve insulin sensitivity and metabolic function.\n1. Animal Selection and Study Preparation\nSelect diet and weight stable animals based on monthly food intake and body weight records.\n\tNOTE: Animals that have exhibited a recent decline in appetite should not be characterized until their food intake has stabilized.\n\t\nFor mature animals (> 5 - 6 yr), do not select animals whose body weights between consecutive months differ by more than 10% without first examining the monkey and ruling out causes other than changing metabolic status for the dramatic change in weight.\nFor glucose, insulin and c-peptide analytes, prepare K2EDTA sample collection tubes with protease inhibitor (Aprotinin and DPP4I).\n\tNOTE: The DPP4I + Aprotinin cocktail provides a broad spectrum of protease inhibition should this be required for additional analytes (glucagon, GLP-1). In the event that additional analytes are not collected, the blood tubes should be prepared in the same way to maintain consistency in sample collection. Samples for assays not validated for this method should be collected separately, according to the recommendations of the manufacturer.\n\t\nPrepare the protease inhibitor cocktail by mixing 100 mg lyophilized Aprotinin with 10 ml of DPP4I. Add 10 µl of the Aprotinin + DPP4I mixture to each blood tube for every milliliter of blood collected.\nAdd an additional 10 µl of the protease inhibitor cocktail to each tube for possible collection overage. Store the treated-blood tubes at -20 °C until use. Keep the tubes on wet ice during the procedure and spin at 4 °C.",
    "Use a serum separator tube to collect a blood sample at baseline for standard serum chemistry analysis. For the Complete Blood Cell count (CBC), use a standard K2EDTA without protease inhibitors. Use cryovials to aliquot plasma and serum after the blood samples have been spun down.\nLabel the blood tubes and the cryovials appropriately with the animal identification, date, procedure, timepoint, and sample volume. Label the cryovials with the analyte(s) in plasma for appropriate assay.\nPrepare the heparinized saline flush by injecting 0.15 ml of 1,000 USP units per ml heparin into a 250 ml bag of normal saline. Obtain a solution of 0.06 mg heparin/ml. Draw 40 - 60 ml of this solution into a saline lock for flushing between samples. Draw an additional 1 ml and 5 ml into separate syringes for flushing the dextrose infusion port before and after the infusion, respectively.\n2. Animal Sedation and Preparation\nRemove food from the animal's cage no less than 14 hr before the procedure, and no more than 18 hr.\n\tNOTE: It is important that animals be fasted for the procedure to avoid any post-prandial variation in glycemic values. It is also a precaution to avoid regurgitation and aspiration of stomach contents while anesthetized.\nSedate animals for the duration of the IVGTT procedure with ketamine given intramuscularly as a general anesthetic, at 10 mg/kg. Administer additional ketamine (5 - 10 mg/kg) at intervals of 20 - 30 min, or as needed, during the procedure.\n\t\nWeigh the sedated animal. Place the animal in a laterally recumbent position on a heated procedure table.",
    "Monitor clinical parameters every 15 to 20 min to ensure the animal is in a stable plane of anesthesia. Measure heart rate (100 - 200 bpm) and SPO2 (> 92%) with a pulse oximeter. Measure respiratory rate (20 - 50 breaths/min) with a stopwatch, counting respirations visually or by hand over fifteen seconds and multiplying by four. Measure temperature (> 97 °F) rectally. Monitor the color of the mucous membrane around the gum and lips (moist, pink).\nPrepare two cannula sites. Use hair clippers to trim the hair from the area of interest where the catheter will be inserted, and sterilize the entire region with alternating scrubs of chlorhexidine and 70% alcohol.\n\t\nPlace one catheter in the region of the left or right cephalic or saphenous veins and attach it to a heparin saline flush (0.06 mg heparin/ml) with a three-way stopcock. This is the sampling blood draw site.\nPlace the second catheter in another leg or arm in the region of the cephalic or saphenous veins and attach a port. Use this site for the dextrose infusion. Use a small, 1 ml flush of heparinized saline to keep the cannula patent prior to dextrose infusion.\n3. IVGTT Procedure\nNOTE: The IVGTT procedure consists of 8 blood draw sampling time-points (Table 1).\nTake the baseline sample and use a hand held glucometer to measure the fasting blood glucose level. Obtain a serum sample for standard chemistry analysis, as well as a whole blood sample for a CBC in order to assess the overall health of the animal. Collect plasma samples to assay glucose and insulin levels from the baseline sample using a kit validated for use with macaques as per the manufacturer's instructions 8, 9.",
    "NOTE: It is important to have a pre-draw of 0.5 ml taken from the cannula prior to taking any sample for blood collection to remove residual blood or heparin in the dead-space of the cannula.\nAfter obtaining the baseline sample, infuse the dose of 50% dextrose (250 mg/kg) over 30 sec into the dextrose infusion port.\n\tNOTE: Higher dose models (500 mg/kg) can be used, though the dose should be fixed across procedures in order to make longitudinal comparisons.\n\t\nFlush the infusion port with 5 ml of heparinized saline to make sure that there is no dextrose left in the port. The end of the infusion is the T0. Have the technician replace the gloves, as residual dextrose from the infusion may contaminate subsequent blood samples.\nThe first post-infusion sample time point is at T3 min, from the end of dextrose infusion, followed by T5 min, T7 min, T10 min, T15 min, T20 min, and the last sample time point is at T30 min. Collect plasma from each timepoint to assay glucose and insulin levels with the baseline sample (see step 3.1).\n\t\nAt the T3 min time point, use the hand held glucometer to once again check the blood glucose level.\n\t\tNOTE: The glucometer readings at baseline and T3 are only to confirm the infusion of the dextrose. The blood glucose level at the T3 min time point should be ~100 mg/dl higher compared to the fasting baseline plasma glucose level.\n4. Animal Recovery and Sample Processing\nRemove the cannulas and apply pressure to the catheterized sites for hemostasis after the T30 min time-point. Monitor the animal until it has regained consciousness and is sitting up. Offer feed once the animal is fully recovered.",
    "Immediately place each whole blood sample into K2EDTA tubes on ice. Centrifuge at 3,000 rpm at a temperature of 4 °C within 10 min of collection. Aliquot plasma samples into cryovials, freeze and store at -80 °C until analysis.\n\t\nAllow the blood into the serum tube for standard serum chemistry analysis to sit at room temperature for no less than 20 min and no more than 30 min before centrifugation at 3,000 rpm at RT. Freeze the serum samples until assayed within 48 hr of collection.\n\t\tNOTE: Refrigerate the whole blood samples collected for CBC analysis until assayed within 24 hr of collection.\n5. Data Treatment\nAfter establishing the plasma insulin and glucose curves, determine the glucose clearance rate K from the slope of the natural log of glucose values above baseline 16, 17.\n\tNOTE: A healthy NHP may be expected to have a glucose clearance rate K well above 1, often greater than 2 or more, as a healthy animal will often return to their baseline glucose values within 30 min. As insulin production drops off, the glucose clearance rate K will drop more dramatically, falling below 1.\nCalculate the AUC as a whole, as the sum of totals of the area of the trapezoids representing the area under the curve of each line segment between time-points, through T30 16, 17.",
    "NOTE: Traditionally, the AUC of the first ten minutes of the procedure is considered the acute insulin response to glucose (AIR), while the AUC from the last 20 min of the procedure is considered the late insulin response (LIR). As the animal becomes more dysmetabolic, the insulin AUC will increase, reflecting compensation for increasing insulin insensitivity. As the animal transitions to overt diabetes, however, the AUC will decrease, often initially in the acute insulin phase, captured by the AIR.\nSubscription Required.
