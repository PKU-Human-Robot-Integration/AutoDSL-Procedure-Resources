    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTIF analysis\nTiming: 2 days\nTiming: 3.5 h for antibody incubation\nTiming: 20 h for probe hybridization\nDNA damage response or DDR at telomere is considered as TIFs (Takai et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). The TIF assay is performed by the co-localization of DNA damage marker, γH2AX or 53BP1, and telomere markers, such as TRF1 (Takai et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]), TRF2 (Mender and Shay, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) or PNA probe (Rai and Chang, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nAntibody incubation\nRemove the medium of cell culture and wash cells with 1×PBS once.\nFix cells with 100% cold methanol at −20°C for 10 min.\nWash cells three times with 1 mL 1× cold PBS for 5 min.\nIncubate cells with blocking solution for 40 min at 15°C–25°C.\nIncubate cells with primary antibody (anti 53BP1 antibody, 1:100 dilution) diluted in blocking solution for 1 h at 15°C–25°C. Coverslips are incubated cell-side-down on antibody solution (10 μL per slide, spotted on parafilm) in a humidified chamber.\nWash cells three times with 1× PBS, each for 5 min.\nIncubate cells with secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution) diluted in blocking solution for 40 min at 15°C–25°C. Coverslips are incubated cell-side-down on antibody solution (10 μL per slide, spotted on parafilm) in a humidified chamber.\nWash cells three times with 1 mL 1×PBS, each for 5 min.\nProbe hybridization\nFix the cells for 2% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at 15°C–25°C.\nWash cells three times with 1× PBS for 5 min.\nDehydrate the cells in 70%, 95% and 100% ethanol consecutively for 5 min each.\nDry the cover slips for 5–10 min.\nPlace the humidified chamber into 80°C oven for preheating.\nPlace 25 μL hybridization solution on the slide and flip the cover slips upside down in hybridization solution.\nPlace the slide in preheated humidified chamber.",
    "Denature with hybridization solution for 8 min at 80°C.\nTake the humidified chamber containing slides out of the 80°C oven\nPut the humidified chamber containing slides in 4°C refrigerator for 16 h.\nWash cells twice with 1 mL washing solution at 15°C–25°C, each for 15 min.\nWash cells three times with 1×PBS, each for 5 min.\nStain the nuclear in DAPI solution (0.1 μg/mL) for 5 min.\nWash cells once with 1 mL PBS for 5 min.\nDry the slides for 10 min.\nPlace coverslips cell-side-down on slides with one drop of antifade mounting medium being careful to eliminate all air bubbles. Seal the coverslip with clear nail polish and slides are ready for microscopy or can be stored at 4°C and images acquired at a later time.\nImaging with a fluorescent microscope\nTiming: 1 day\nImaging\nAcquire images by a DeltaVision® fluorescent microscope with 60x objective.\nThe images were taken by softWoRx 6.0 software.\nSet the image size: 1,024 × 1,024.\nSet the parameters: three channels: TRITC (excitation: 555/28 nm, emission: 617/73 nm, for telomere probe), FITC (excitation: 490/20 nm, emission: 528/38 nm, for 53BP1 signal) and DAPI (excitation: 360/40 nm, emission: 457/50 nm, for DNA staining).\nAdjust light source intensity and exposure time for each channels: TRITC, 50% intensity and 0.6 s, FITC, 32% intensity and 0.5 s and DAPI, 2% intensity, 0.1 s.\nSet Z-stack distance: approximately 2 μm, make sure the middle location got the most clear images and take an image every 0.5 μm.\nTake images and label the name the images.\nPerform de-convolution and quick projection processes to improve the quality of images. Particularly, Z-projection using maximum pixel intensity is applied.\nData collection: A total of 50 images were taken for each condition.\nImage analysis\nTiming: 1 day",
    "Co-localization analysis Images were de-convoluted followed by quick projection process and the co-localization analysis of two different fluorescence signals was performed by Image J software.\nQuantitation is performed using Image J software\nIdentify images in Photoshop.\nSelect images using Image J, and split channels, blue (nuclear, DAPI staining), red (telomere, PNA probe) and green (53 BP1, 488 secondary antibody)\nChoose Plugins: CO-LOCALIZATION threshold, channel 1 (red) and channel 2 (green) will be displayed, choose red and green channels, and pick show scatter button.\nChoose Plugin and use Colocalization Finder, to analyze the co-localization of channel 1 and channel 2, and then press OK button.\nView results in the scatter plot windows.\nConfirm the co-localization: the Pearson’s R value in 0.5–1.0 and the Mander’s value in 0.6–1.0 was considered as co-localization.\nSummarize the results: record the co-localization values in an Excel sheet and get the number of co-localization in cells.\nIn one cell, more than 3 co-localizations of 53BP1 and telomeres were considered to be TIF positive cell. About 300–500 cells were calculated in one condition."
