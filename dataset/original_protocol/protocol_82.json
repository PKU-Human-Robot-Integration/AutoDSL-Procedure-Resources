    "**Small RNA extraction** ●TIMING 1 h\n**1**| Prepare RNA from fresh or cry preserved tissue or cells \\(or cell lines) with the use of a mirVana miRNA isolation kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions and using the small-RNA fraction option, which allows purification of small RNA molecules of 200 nt.  A 50 μl volume is obtained.\n**2**| Precipitate the RNA from the 50 μl volume of sample obtained in Step 1 by adding 2.5 μl of 5 M NaCl and 150 μl ethanol, keep it on dry ice for 30 min, centrifuge it at 14,000 g for 20 min at 4 °C, discard the supernatant and rinse the precipitate with 80 % ethanol before allowing it to air dry.  Dissolve the RNA precipitate in 5 μl DEPC water.  If the yield of RNA is thought to be >0.5 μg, determine the RNA concentration by measurement of absorbance at 260 nm.  If the concentration of RNA is >1μg μl–1, then it should be adjusted to 1μg μl–1 with DEPC water.  \n**▲CRITICAL STEP** Precipitation of a small amount of small RNAs requires that the volume of the solution be small.\n**■PAUSE POINT** The RNA solution can be stored at –80 °C for several weeks. \n**Polyadenylation of small RNAs**●TIMING 2h\n**3**| In a sterile 0.2 ml microfuge tube\\(**Table 2**).\n**4**| Incubate the mixture at 37 °C for 1h. \n**■PAUSE POINT** The incubation can be extended up to 16 h.\n**5**| Add 50 μl phenol-chloroform to the reaction mixture.  Mix, then spin at 13,000 g at 4 °C for 15 min.",
    "**6**| Collect the aqueous phase, add 5 μl \\(1/10 vol), 3 M sodium acetate \\(pH 5.2), add 150 μl \\(3 vol) 100 % ethanol, and add 1 μl glycogen \\(20 μg/ μl).  Precipitate Poly \\(A)-tailed small RNA for at least 2 h at –20 °C.  Precipitation overnight is preferred.\n**7**| Spin precipitated Poly \\(A)-tailed small RNA at 13,000 g for 20 min.\n**8**| Carefully remove the supernatant and add 1ml 80 % ethanol to wash the pellet.  Spin at 12,000 g at 4ºC for 10 min.\n**9**| Carefully remove all the liquid, avoiding touching the pellet.  Air–dry the pellet at room temperature. \n**10**| Dissolve the dried pellet in 10 µl DEPC-H2O. \n**■PAUSE POINT** The sample can be stored at–20 °C for several months.\n**Ligation of 5’adaptor to Poly \\(A)-tailed small RNA** ●TIMING 1.5 h\n**11**| In a sterile 0.2 mL microfuge tube\\(**Table 3**).\n**12|** Incubate the mixture at 37 °C for 1h. \n**■PAUSE POINT** The incubation can be extended up to 16 h.\n**13**| Add 50 μl phenol-chloroform to the reaction mixture.  Mix, then spin at 13,000 g at 4 °C for 15 min.\n**14**| Collect the aqueous phase, add 4 μl \\(1/10 vol), 3 M sodium acetate \\(pH 5.2), add 120 μl \\(3 vol) 100 % ethanol, and add 1 μl glycogen \\(20 μg/ μl).  Precipitate 5’adaptor-small RNA-Poly \\(A)n for at least 2 h at –20 °C.  Precipitation overnight is preferred. \n**15**| Spin precipitated 5’ adaptor-small RNA-Poly \\(A)n at 13,000g for 20 min.\n**16**| Carefully remove the supernatant and add 1ml 80 % ethanol to wash the pellet.  Spin at 12,000 g at 4ºC for 10 min. \n**17**| Carefully remove all the liquid, avoiding touching the pellet.  Air–dry the pellet at room temperature. \n**18**| Dissolve the dried pellet in 10 µl DEPC-H2O.",
    "**■PAUSE POINT** The sample can be stored at–80 °C for several weeks.\n**Reverse transcription** ●TIMING 1.5 h\n**19**| Combine the following in a 0.2 ml microfuge tube on ice \\(**Table 4**).\n**20**| Incubate at 65°C for 5 min, then place on ice for 2 min.\n**21**| Prepare the following cDNA Synthesis Mix, adding each component in the indicated order \\(**Table 5**).\n**22**| Add 10 µl of cDNA Synthesis Mix to each RNA/primer mixture, mix gently, and collect by brief centrifugation. \n**23**| Incubate the mixture at 50 °C for 1 h.\n**24**| Terminate the reactions at 85°C for 5 min then chill on ice. \n**25**| Collect the reactions by brief centrifugation.  Add 1 µl of RNase H to each tube and incubate for 20 min at 37°C. \n**■PAUSE POINT** The sample can be stored at–20 °C for several months.\n**PCR amplification of small RNA-derived cDNAs by 5’miR-RACE and 3’miR-RACE** \n●TIMING 4.5 h\n**First-round amplification** ●TIMING 2.5 h\n**26**| In a sterile, 0.2 ml microfuge tube, mix the following reagents for each experimental and control sample from Step 25 \\(**Table 6**).\n**27**| Add a 1 ml aliquot of the diluted first-round amplification products \\(obtained in Step 25 above) and 25 pmol each of mirRacer 3’ primer and mirRacer 5’ primer \\(**Fig. 1b**).  Set up a ‘no-template’ control as well.\n**28**| Mix and then heat in a DNA thermal cycler for 5 min at 98 °C to denature the first-strand products and to activate the polymerase.\n**29**| Carry out 25 cycles of amplification with a ‘step’ program  \\(**Table 7**).\n**■PAUSE POINT** The products can be stored at -20 °C for several weeks.\n**Second-round amplification** ●TIMING 2.5 h \n**30**| Dilute a portion of the amplification products from the first round 1: 20 in TE buffer.",
    "**▲CRITICAL STEP** A second round of amplification is required because the use of mirRacer 5’ primer and the mirRacer 3’ primer \\(in combination with a universal primer that binds to all of the cDNA templates present in the starting mixture) results in a substantial yield of a pool of non-gene-specific products.  The second round, which uses a gene-specific primer \\(again in combination with a universal primer), eliminates most or all of the nonspecific products.\n**31**| In a sterile, 0.2 ml microfuge tube, mix the following reagents on ice  \\(**Table 8**).:\n**32**| Add a 1 ml aliquot of the diluted first-round amplification products \\(obtained in Step 31 above) and 25 pmol each of primers GSP2 and GSP1 \\(**Fig. 1**).  Set up a ‘no-template’ control as well. \n**■PAUSE POINT** The PCR products can be stored at –20 °C for several months.\n**33**| Mix and heat in a DNA thermal cycler for 5 min at 98 °C to denature the first-strand products and to activate the polymerase.\n**34**| Carry out 30 cycles of amplification with a ‘step’ program  \\(**Table 9**).\n**PAUSE POINT** The products can be stored at -20 °C for several weeks.\n**35**| Separate 10 % of the products of first-and second-round amplification by electrophoresis through a 2.5 % agarose gel.  Use the information gained from this analysis to optimize the miR-RACE procedure \\(see **ANTICIPATED RESULTS**). \n**■PAUSE POINT** The DNA solution can be stored at–20 °C for several months."
