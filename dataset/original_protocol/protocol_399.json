    "**Procedures A. Flow chamber preparation and whole blood perfusion**\n**A1. Preparation of coverslips**\n_CRITICAL. Wash cleaned coverslips thoroughly with water._\n \n**1.** Degrease new coverslips \\(use tweezers) with 2 M HCl in 50% ethanol.\n**2.** Wash coverslips twice with milliQ water to remove residual HCl.\n**3.** Leave coverslips to dry on drying rack.\n**A2. Coating of coverslips**\n_CRITICAL. Prevent drying of biological material on coverslip by storing in humid environment._\n**4.** Prepare coating material \\(collagen, collagen peptide, decorin, fibrinogen, fibronectin, laminin, osteopontin, rhodocytin, thrombospondin, vitronectin, vWF), at 50-250 μg/mL, as described.<sup>9</sup> \n**5.** Mount coverslip onto precision mall for coating.\n**6.** Apply 0.5 µL of coating solution\\(s) in the assigned place\\(s), and remove from the mall.\n**7.** Store coverslip in humid environment to prevent drying out of microspots. Allow coating material to bind for 60 minutes at room temperature.\n**8.** Block uncoated glass with blocking buffer, and leave in humid environment for 30 minutes.\n**9.** Wash blocked coverslip with saline. If not immediately used, leave coverslip in humid environment to prevent drying.\n**A3. Assembly of coverslip and flow chamber** \n_CRITICAL. Check for leakage of the mounted flow chamber. Also check rigorously for absence of air bubbles before starting the experiment. Note that temperature changes can lead to appearance of air bubbles. Keep inlet tubing as short as possible_\n**10**. Connect tubing to inlet and outlet of the flow chamber.\n**11.** Rinse chamber and tubing with flow buffer, check for absence of air bubbles, and mount coated coverslip on top of chamber.\n**12.** Place chamber with coverslip in aluminium holder and tighten screws.\n**13.** Check that flow chamber system is leak-tight by perfusion with flow buffer, flush out any bubbles in chamber.\n**A4. Drawing of human blood by venipuncture**",
    "_CRITICAL: Before drawing human blood, obtain permission from your Medical Ethical Committee, according to the local and national regulations, and get full informed consent from donor. Coagulation \\(traces of thrombin) need to be rigorously prevented by drawing without constraints, mixing well with anticoagulant, and incubation at 37oC. Note that PPACK is only shortly active as an anticoagulant at neutral pH. Other possible errors are described elsewhere.<sup>4</sup>_\n**14.** Add 0.5 mL saline into a 5 mL polystyrene blood collection tube. Add 40 U/mL \\(f.c.) fragmin, and add 40 µM PPACK \\(f.c.) just before venipuncture.\n**15.** Draw blood according to local protocols, and let smoothly flow into collection tube. Directly mix blood with anticoagulant solution. We prefer an open system using a 23 gauge needle, to ensure undisturbed flow. Discard first 1 mL of blood before filling blood collection tube.\n**16.** Incubate the collected blood at 37°C for 10-15 minutes to allow platelets to resensitize.\n**17.** Preferably, determine platelet and red cell counts. A decrease in platelet count points to aggregation of platelets, e.g. by traces of thrombin.\n**18.** Add additional 20 µM PPACK \\(f.c.) once per hour.\n**A5. Blood perfusion through flow chamber**\n_CRITICAL: Check for correct pump settings to obtain the requested shear rate. Check for absence of air bubbles and fibrin clots during the experiment. Preferably use an inverted microscope. Several possible errors are described elsewhere._<sup>4</sup>\n**19.** Only for experiments to determine stable platelet adhesion or thrombus volume, add 0.5 µg/mL DiOC6 \\(f.c.) to 0.5 mL blood sample. Allow staining of the blood cells for 5 minutes.\n**20.** Draw 0.5 mL blood sample into 1 mL syringe equipped with blunt needle. Make sure that no air is present in top of needle.",
    "**21.** Connect syringe with blood sample to inlet tubing of prepared flow chamber. Carefully avoid air bubbles \\(fluid-fluid contact).\n**22.** Prepare 1 mL syringe with flow buffer with required fluorescent labels. The following labels are suitable for post-staining: FITC-labeled anti-CD62P mAb \\(1.25 µg/mL) or FITC-labeled anti-fibrinogen mAb \\(1:100) and/or AF647-labeled annexin A5 \\(0.25 µg/mL) \\(all f.c.).\n**23.** Mount flow chamber and holder on stage of the microscope, and identify position of microspots with camera. Focus on optical plane of one microspot.\n**24.** Place syringe filled with whole blood on perfusion pump \\(push mode). Ensure proper pump settings \\(arterial wall shear rate: 1600 s<sup>-1</sup> for 3.5 minutes or 1000 s<sup>-1</sup> for 4 minutes; venous wall shear rate 150 s<sup>-1</sup> for 6 minutes). Note that the wall shear rate depends on the flow rate and the dimensions of the flow chamber. For calculation, see elsewhere.<sup>4</sup>\n**25.** Switch pump on. The experiment starts when the blood has reached the site of the microspots.\n**A6. Recording of stable adhesion and thrombus volume using DiOC<sub>6</sub>-labeled platelets**\n_CRITICAL: Rinse shortly to prevent disaggregation of thrombi._\n**26.** During the first 2 minutes of whole blood perfusion, record DiOC<sub>6</sub> fluorescence microscopic images at 2-seconds intervals \\(real-time recording of stable platelet adhesion).\n**27.** After 3.5, 4 or 6 minutes of perfusion \\(depending on shear rate), change syringe with blood by syringe with flow buffer; set pump rate at 1000 s<sup>-1</sup>.\n**28.** For 2 minutes, rinse chamber with flow buffer.\n**29.** Take confocal z-stacks from thrombi during stasis; 2 to 3 stacks per microspot \\(recording of thrombus volume).\n**A7. Recording of brightfield images and post-staining with fluorescent labels**\n_CRITICAL: Rinse shortly to prevent disaggregation of thrombi. Prevent air bubbles in flow chamber during syringe replacements._\n**30.** Starting from point 25.",
    "**31.** At the end of the whole-blood perfusion, change syringe with blood by syringe with fluorescent labels; set pump rate at 1000 s-1.\n**32.** For 2 minutes, perfuse buffer with labels through flow chamber; leave 1 minute for staining.\n**33.** During the perfusion, take brightfield microscopic images \\(5 per microspot) under flow.\n**34.** Change syringe with labels by syringe with flow buffer; and perfuse for 2 minutes to remove unbound label.\n**35.** Take fluorescence images during stasis \\(5 images per microspot).\n**Procedures B.

    "_CRITICAL: Measurement of surface area coverage of brightfield and fluorescence images. The following procedures apply to 8-bit TIFF and PIC images. Conversion to 8-bit images can be done using ImageJ software \\(Open access). Image analysis can also be performed with ImageJ. Output data are given as numbers of pixels per region. To determine surface area coverage, use total pixel number of images. Note that the outcome of the analyses depends on the quality of the recorded images._\n**1. Protocol for stable platelet adhesion \\(see Fig. 2)**\na. Threshold every image within one time series with the same threshold → binary image.\nb. In “process” and “arithmic”, choose the first binary image as “source image 1” and the second binary image as “source image 2”.\nc. Click “subtract” with constant values at “0”.\nd. Choose apply.\ne.
