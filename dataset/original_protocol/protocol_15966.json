    "To promote the development of CeD, DQ8-Dd-villin-IL-15tg mice must be exposed to gluten via the oral route (Abadie et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0002]). Mice that are born and raised on a gluten-free diet are transferred to a gluten-containing diet. Although rodent regular chow might provide sufficient gluten exposure, intragastric administration of gliadin—a major component of wheat gluten protein—by oral gavage ensures that all the animals receive a consistent amount of antigen. This protocol details the preparation of gliadin for intragastric administration and the regimen of gluten administration used to study the initiation of CeD, remission upon gluten withdrawal, and relapse following gluten re-exposure.\nMaterials\nGliadin from wheat (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no.

    "To study the immunological and histological features developing during the initial gluten-induced activation phase (with patent villous atrophy typically observed after 4 weeks of gluten exposure), set up the regimen in Figure 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-fig-0001]. To study remission and gut healing after gluten withdrawal, set up the regimen in Figure 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-fig-0001]. To study disease reactivation with a regimen that mimics clinical trials in patients with established CeD who are on a gluten-free diet and are then challenged with gluten, set up the regimen in Figure 1C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-fig-0001].\nPreparation of gliadin balls\nThe studies outlined above require administration of gliadin balls by oral gavage; this is accomplished as follows:\n1. Weigh 200 mg of gliadin in a weighing dish.\n2. Add to a microcentrifuge tube, and then add 1 ml of 1× DPBS. Mix using a toothpick and let sit for a couple of minutes.\nThe consistency should be similar to raw pizza dough.\n3. Extract from the microcentrifuge tube using the toothpick, pressing against the tube's walls to remove any excess fluid, and place in a dish. Using a razor blade, cut the preparation in 10 equal pieces so as to obtain 10 “balls” each containing ∼20 mg of crude gliadin.\nOral gavage\n4. Ear tag the mice for identification.\n5. Transfer mice that are to be exposed to gluten into a cage containing regular rodent chow. Maintain control mice on a gluten-free diet.\n6. Fit an animal feeding needle on a 1-ml syringe, and place a gliadin ball on the tip of the needle. For controls, fill a syringe with 100 μl of DPBS, avoiding formation of any air bubbles.",
    "7. Remove the first mouse from the cage by the base of the tail. Using the thumb and index finger, grasp the nape of the neck. Lift the mouse and hold it in an upright position, securing the tail between the palm and little finger of the hand.\nThe head of the mouse should be stabilized.\n8. Once the mouse is properly restrained, insert the feeding needle into the mouse's mouth, over its tongue, and deposit a gliadin ball into the back of the mouth. The mouse will either swallow it directly or chew it first before swallowing it. For DPBS administration (control), slowly inject the 100 μl of DPBS into the esophagus using the gavage needle. In both cases, slowly remove the needle following the same angle used for its insertion.\nMice are gavaged every other day during the duration of the experiment.\n9. Monitor the animal for normal breathing pattern before returning it to the cage.\n10. Clean the work area with appropriate disinfectant. Discard the syringes. Wash feeding needle with soap and disinfect with 70% ethanol before sterilizing.\n11. Euthanize mice (Donovan & Brown, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0019]) at 30 days or at later time points (see Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-fig-0001] regarding the timeline of gluten administration) following the first gluten exposure to assess the development of villous atrophy (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-prot-0002]), determine the activation of cytotoxic intraepithelial lymphocytes (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-prot-0006]), and analyze TG2 activation and the levels of anti-gluten or anti-gliadin antibodies (Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-prot-0007]).",
    "The DQ8-Dd-villin-IL-15tg mouse model phenocopies key features of active CeD following gluten exposure, including intraepithelial lymphocytosis and the development of villous atrophy. However, the site of these changes in the mouse model differs from that in humans with CeD. While in humans the lesions are classically found in the proximal small bowel, in gluten-fed DQ8-Dd-villin-IL-15tg mice, the ileum is the major site of histopathological changes. This may stem from differences in gut physiology between mice and humans, such as the mouse stomach being less acidic and mice having a significantly faster transit time (Hugenholtz & de Vos, 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0027]). In support of this explanation, in gluten-dosed rodents, the ileum contained the highest concentration of gluten, followed by the jejunum, and gluten was almost absent in the duodenum (Gass, Vora, Bethune, Gray, & Khosla, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0024]). In addition, we have found that while the primary site of tissue damage at 4 weeks after gluten exposure is the distal ileum, after prolonged exposure to gluten (for up to 11 weeks), alterations in the proximal ileum and jejunum are also present. Yet another difference between CeD in humans and the DQ8-Dd-villin-IL-15tg mouse model is that crypt hyperplasia is not consistently observed in this model.\nBasic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-prot-0002] describes how to process small intestine biopsies, as well as methods required to perform quantitative histology, i.e., measurements of villous height and crypt depth presented as a villous height–to–crypt depth ratio, and intraepithelial lymphocyte counts that allow the most accurate and reliable determination of mucosal injury in CeD (Adelman et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0004]; Arguelles-Grande, Tennyson, Lewis, Green, & Bhagat, 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0006]; Cummins et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0011]; Daveson et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0012]; Picarelli et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0065]; Taavela et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0077]).\nMaterials\nGluten-fed mice (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-prot-0001])\n70% ethanol\nDPBS, sterile (Corning Cellgro)\nFormalin solution, neutral-buffered, 10%, histological tissue fixative (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no.

Euthanize the mouse using CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation in accordance with your Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines.\nSee Donovan & Brown (2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0019]) for detailed protocols on these euthanasia procedures.\n2. Place the mouse on its back on a dissecting board and spray 70% ethanol on its chest and abdomen to prevent contamination by hair.\n3. Perform a midline incision using sharp straight scissors and retract the skin from the peritoneal wall underneath using forceps. Pin the skin on both sides of the abdomen.\n4. Using sharp straight scissors and forceps, perform an incision through the peritoneal wall to reveal the abdominal cavity.\n5. Cut the small intestine 0.5 cm from the stomach, below the pyloric sphincter and at the lowest extent of the distal small intestine above the cecum. Slowly pull out the whole small intestine and place it on a PBS-moistened paper towel.\nAlways orient the small intestine from the proximal part on the left to the distal part on the right to easily identify duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.\n6. Cut a ∼0.8 cm segment of the distal ileum 0.5 cm from the cecum. Gently push the luminal content out of the gut segment using the back of the curved tips of forceps.",
    "To accurately compare tissue alterations between different mice, it is important to analyze segments of the distal ileum that have been consistently taken 0.5 cm from the cecum.\n7. Place the segment in a tissue-processing histology cassette (identified by marking with a pencil) and immerse the cassette in 10% (v/v) neutral-buffered formalin solution for 24-48 hr.\n8. Transfer the cassette to 70% ethanol until the tissue can be processed and embedded in paraffin. Cut 5 μm transverse section, apply the tissue section onto a slide, and stain with hematoxylin and eosin.\nTissue processing, paraffin embedding, sectioning, and hematoxylin & eosin staining are standard procedures that can be performed in a histology laboratory. See Hofman & Taylor (2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0025]) for detailed protocols.\nThe orientation of the intestinal segment is critical. The best section is composed of an intact submucosa, muscularis, and serosa. The best ileal cross-sections should comprise two serosal attachments (the mesentery and the ileocecal fold). It is essential to only analyze specimens for which the lumen is devoid of any fecal material and for which the plane of sectioning is perpendicular to the luminal surface, as indicated by the presence of only one longitudinally cut crypt between two adjacent villi.\n9. Analyze the sections under a standard light microscope to assess gluten-mediated small intestinal histopathological changes (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-prot-0003]).",
    "Morphometric analyses of small intestinal biopsies in well-oriented sections represent the best way of assessing the extent of tissue damage and remodeling in CeD (Adelman et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0004]; Arguelles-Grande et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0006]; Daveson et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0012]; Picarelli et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0065]; Taavela et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0077]). Intestinal damage is the hallmark of CeD, yet CeD can be heterogeneous in its histological presentation, with various degrees of villous atrophy ranging from mild villous blunting up to partial or total villous atrophy (Husby et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0029]; Marsh, 1990[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0051]).\nVillous height–to–crypt depth ratio measurement\n1. Under a light microscope equipped with a high-resolution camera and imaging system, take pictures of the whole intestinal section.\n2. Using image processing and analysis software allowing distance measurements, measure the villous height and crypt depth of five well-oriented villi starting with the shortest ones for any sample analyzed. The villous height is measured from the tip to the shoulder of the villus or up to the top of the crypt of Lieberkuhn. The crypt depth is measured as the distance from the top of the crypt of Lieberkuhn to the deepest level of the crypt (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-fig-0002]).\nAs mentioned in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-prot-0002], tangential sections can erroneously indicate tissue abnormalities. Therefore, if the poor orientation of a section prevents correct morphometric assessment of the sample, additional tissue sections must be cut and analyzed.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ff53adfd-14a0-41a0-872a-8611f7dc81b0/cpz1515-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nMorphometric measurements of the villous height and crypt depth.\n3. The villous height/crypt depth ratio is calculated by dividing the villous height by the corresponding crypt depth.\nOf note, as in celiac patients, duodenal inflammation can be patchy (Husby & Murray, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0030]; Rubio-Tapia & Murray, 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0068]), with histological changes only present in some portion of the intestinal sections. Performing the analysis on the five shortest well-oriented villi ensures data accuracy.",
    "All assessments must be performed blindly by two independent investigators.",
    "BrdU incorporation analyses have demonstrated that the decrease in villous height to crypt depth ratio in DQ8-Dd-villin-IL-15tg mice are associated with increased epithelial cells renewal. In DQ8-Dd-villin-IL-15tg mice with villous atrophy, BrdU incorporation is seen at the tip of villi, i.e., at a site where epithelial cells are proliferating to compensate for epithelial cells loss. In the other DQ8 and IL-15 tg mouse strains that do not have mucosal injury upon gluten administration, BrdU incorporation is only visible at the bottom of the villi and in crypt cells (Fig. 3).\nMaterials\nBrdU solution (BD Biosciences, cat.no. 550891)\nBrdU In-Situ Detection kit (BD Pharmingen, cat. no. 550803)\nXylene (Sigma-Aldrich)\nEthanol (Sigma-Aldrich)\nHydrogen peroxide (H2O2; Sigma-Aldrich)\n1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), sterile (see recipe)\nGill's hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich)\nAquamount mounting medium\nCoplin jars\nCoverslips\n1. 24 hr before euthanasia of mice subjected to one of the studies outlined in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-prot-0001], inject mice intraperitoneally with 100 µl (1 mg) of BrdU solution.\n2.

Deparaffinize slides in two changes of xylene for 5 min each. Transfer the slides to 100% ethanol. Perform two changes for 3 min each time. Transfer once into 95% ethanol for 3 min\n4. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating the slides for 10 min in 3% H2O2 in PBS.\n5. Rinse the slides in PBS, three times for 5 min each time.",
    "6. Proceed to antigen retrieval by immersing the slides in a Coplin jar containing the working solution of BD Retrievagen A (from the BrdU In-Situ Detection kit) and heat in a microwave oven to 193°F (89°C). Hold the slides at that temperature for 10 min. BD Retrievagen A is prepared per manufacturer's recommendations by mixing 9 ml of Solution 1 with 41 ml of Solution 2 and bringing up the volume to 500 ml with distilled water.\nAntigen retrieval is the critical step of this protocol, and its correct performance requires careful control of the temperature in the microwave oven. Thus, the temperature program of the microwave oven needs to be verified before proceeding to this step.\n7. Remove the Coplin jar with the slides, cover the jar tightly, and allow the solution to slowly cool down to room temperature for 20 min.\n8. Rinse the slides three times in PBS, each time for 5 min.\n9. Dilute the biotinylated anti-BrdU antibody 1:10 in the Diluent buffer.

Prepare the DAB substrate solution by adding 1 drop of DAB chromogen to 1 ml of DAB Buffer, according to the kit manufacturer's recommendations. Apply DAB substrate solution to cover the tissue sections and incubate for 5 min. Monitor the development of the color and the color intensity.\n14. Rinse the slides three times in distilled water, 2 min each time.",

BrdU staining was performed on paraffin-embedded slides to visualize epithelial cells proliferation. BrdU-positive cells appear in brown.",
    "Another hallmark of CeD is a sharp increase in the density of intraepithelial lymphocytes, a factor that correlates with the grade of villous atrophy (Kutlu et al., 1993[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0043]). The amount of intraepithelial lymphocytes per one hundred intestinal epithelial cells is determined on hematoxylin & eosin–stained ileal sections (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-prot-0002]) from sham and gluten-fed mice.\nMaterials\nSample: Hematoxylin and eosin stained small intestine tissue sections (Basic Protocol 2)\nBal supply cell counter (Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 02-670-12)\n1. Under a light microscope equipped with high-magnification objective, count the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes throughout the surface epithelium using a two-key differential counter.\nIntraepithelial lymphocytes are usually identified by their small spherical dense nuclei and are located between epithelial cells that have a rectangular shape, a large cytoplasm, and an oblong centrally located nucleus.\nCell counting can be performed directly under a light microscope or on a computer screen after high-resolution photographs have been taken.\n2. Express results as the number of intraepithelial cells per 100 intestinal epithelial cells. In sham-fed DQ8-Dd-villin-IL-15tg mice, the density of intraepithelial lymphocytes ranges from 15 to 25 per 100 intestinal epithelial cells, while gluten-fed DQ8-Dd-villin-IL-15tg mice have, on average, 40 intraepithelial lymphocytes per 100 intestinal epithelial cells\nImmunohistochemistry can simplify the detection and enumeration of intraepithelial lymphocytes. More specifically, the sections can be stained with a CD3-specific antibody to enhance the identification of infiltrating activated T cells, which can have a more irregularly shaped nucleus (Mino & Lauwers, 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0056]).",
    "In CeD, intraepithelial cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes are the key cell type mediating tissue destruction (Jabri & Sollid, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0035]; Meresse et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0055]). Enterocyte lysis by intraepithelial CD8 lymphocytes is not mediated through gluten-specific mechanisms, but rather involves recognition of stress-induced non-classical MHC class I molecules expressed by intestinal epithelial cells by activating natural killer receptors (NKR) such as NKG2D and CD94/NKG2A, whose expression is upregulated by IL-15 on the surface on IELs (Meresse et al., 2004[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0054]). The pathways employed by cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes to mediate the killing of target cells rely on the release of cytolytic granules. These granules are composed of a dense core containing perforin, various granzymes, and granulysin complexed with proteoglycan, surrounded by an outer membrane containing various lysosomal membrane proteins including CD107a, CD107b, and CD63. During the process of degranulation, the membrane of the granule fuses with the plasma membrane, and the granule contents are released into the immunological synapse between the activated cell and the target cell (Betts & Koup, 2004[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0008]; Betts et al., 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0007]). Degranulation is required for perforin-granzyme mediated killing, and hence the detection of CD107a and CD107b proteins is the best indicator of the functional cytotoxic activity of activated T cells.\nIn the DQ8-Dd-villin-IL-15tg mouse model, the critical role for IELs in mediating intestinal epithelial cells destruction was supported by the finding that CD8 T cell depletion prevented the induction of villous atrophy, and that the expression of activating NK receptors, granzyme B, and CD107 by intraepithelial lymphocytes strongly correlated with the development of villous atrophy (Abadie et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0002]).

    "Additional reagents and equipment for removing the small intestine (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-prot-0001]) and counting cells using a hemacytometer (see Current Protocols article Phelan & May, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0063])\nA. Isolation of epithelial cells and intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) from the small intestine\nThe intestinal epithelial compartment comprises both epithelial cells and IELs. For IEL purification, this compartment is first dissociated from the subjacent lamina propria and is then processed by Percoll centrifugation to separate/isolate the IELs from the epithelial cells as follows:\n1. Remove the small intestine as described in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-prot-0002], and place the intestine on a PBS-moistened paper towel. Remove any fat and connective tissue by teasing with two sets of forceps. Excise all the Peyer's patches by gently positioning them in the tips of forceps and pulling them out. Gently push the feces out of the gut segment using the back of the curved tips of forceps.\nUsing a lighted magnifying glass may be very useful to ensure that all the fat and Peyer's patches have been removed.\n2. Remove any remaining fecal matter or luminal content. To do so, fill a 25-ml syringe equipped with 18- or 20-G gavage needle with 20 ml of cold PBS. Hold the intestine with forceps on top of a large beaker, insert the needle into the gut lumen, and inject the cold PBS to flush out the luminal content.\nThis step can be avoided if the longitudinally opened small intestine is directly washed at least twice, as described in step 3.\n3. Place the intestine back on the PBS-moistened paper towel. Using fine sharp straight scissors, cut the small intestine longitudinally. Transfer tissue to a cell culture dish containing PBS and wash carefully by moving the tissue around, held by forceps, to remove any remaining fecal matter.",
    "4. Cut the small intestine into ∼1 cm pieces on top of a 50-ml conical centrifuge tube containing 15 ml of pre-warmed (37°C) harvest IEL medium, marked with the sample name.\n5. Shake the 50-ml conical centrifuge tubes at 250 rpm, 37°C, for 20 min in a shaker-incubator. The tubes must be placed either on a tube rack that can be inclined, or horizontally into a plastic box that is secured to the shaker with platform clamps.\n6. Following incubation, pour the contents of the 50-ml conical centrifuge tube into another labeled 50-ml conical centrifuge tube through a 70-μm cell strainer. Spin the harvested sample 10 min at 450 × g, 4°C. Resuspend the pellet with 1 ml of PBS containing 2% FBS.\n7. Add 15 ml of pre-warmed (37°C) harvest IEL medium to the first tube containing the tissue pieces. Close the tube tightly and shake the 50-ml conical centrifuge tubes at 250 rpm, 37°C, for 20 min in a shaker-incubator.\n8. Pour the contents of the 50-ml conical centrifuge tube into another labeled 50-ml conical centrifuge tube through a 70-μm cell strainer. Spin the harvested sample 10 min at 450 × g, 4°C. Resuspend the pellet with 1 ml of PBS containing 2% FBS and pool together the cells recovered after each shake.\nThis step separates the released epithelial compartment comprising epithelial cells and intraepithelial lymphocytes from the lamina propria cells still entrapped in the remaining intestinal pieces.\n9. Centrifuge the cell suspension 5 min at 510 × g, 4°C. Discard the supernatant.\n10. Resuspend the pellet in 2 ml of a pre-warmed (room temperature) 40% Percoll solution and transfer the cell solution into a labeled 15-ml conical centrifuge tube that has been pre-filled with 8 ml of the 40% Percoll solution.",
    "11. Centrifuge the gradient 20 min at 1800 × g, room temperature, with minimal acceleration and without brake.\n12. Following centrifugation, the gradient is composed of a layer that contains unwanted cells and debris, and a pellet that contains the lymphocytes. Gently aspirate and discard the gradient and top layer, being careful not to disrupt the pellet, and rinse the pellet with 10 ml of PBS containing 2% FBS.\n13. Centrifuge 5 min at 650 × g, 4°C.\n14. Discard the supernatant and resuspend intraepithelial lymphocytes with 1 ml of culture medium.\n15. Count viable cells using trypan blue dye exclusion, a hemacytometer, and a microscope. Keep cells on ice until further use.\nA detailed protocol for this procedure can be found in Phelan & May (2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0063]).\nB. Assay of IEL cytotoxic potential\nThe functional potential of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (in this case IELs) can be determined ex vivo by cellular expression of CD107a, the best indicator of cell degranulation. In this part of Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-prot-0006], the main steps involved in cell stimulation, cell-surface staining, and intracellular detection of CD107 are described.\nIntraepithelial lymphocytes stimulation in vitro\n16. Dispense 100 μl of cell suspension (2 × 106 cells, from step 15) in culture medium into appropriate wells of a 96-well round-bottom cell culture plate.\nDispense cells into additional wells for instrument setup and compensation controls (well with unstained cells, well with cells only stained with the viability dye, wells containing cells for single-color compensation if cells and not compensation beads are used).",
    "17. Add 100 μl of culture medium supplemented with GolgiPlug (1:500 dilution from stock in culture medium), GolgiStop (1:500 dilution from stock in culture medium), diluted PMA (prepared as indicated in the Reagents and Solutions; 50 ng/ml final), and diluted ionomycin (prepared as indicated in Reagents and Solutions; 1000 ng/ml final).\nFor unstimulated control wells, add 100 μl f culture medium supplemented with GolgiPlug (1:500 dilution from stock) and GolgiStop (1:500 dilution from stock).\n18. Add 10 μl of CD107a/CD107b-FITC cocktail (prepared as indicated in Reagents and Solutions) to each well. Mix wells by pipetting up and down several times.\n19. Cover plate and incubate for 4 hr in a cell culture incubator (5% CO2, 37°C).\n20. Centrifuge the plate 5 min at 450 × g, 4°C.\nCell-surface antigen staining\n21. Following centrifugation, discard supernatant by inverting the plate above a waste tray.\n22. Add 50 μl FcR blocking reagent (anti-CD16/CD32 diluted 1:300 in FACS wash buffer) to each well and mix by pipetting up and down. Incubate the plate 10 min at 4°C in the dark.\n23. Wash the cells with 150 μl of FACS wash buffer. Centrifuge the plate 5 min at 450 × g, 4°C.\n24. Following centrifugation, discard supernatant by inverting the plate above a waste tray. Add 50 μl per well of the viability dye prepared at the appropriate dilution (determined in advance by titration) in DPBS. Mix by pipetting up and down. Incubate the plate for 15 min at 4°C in the dark.\nDuring the viability dye staining, prepare the cell-surface staining cocktail by mixing the appropriate dilutions of all antibodies (determined in advance by titration for each antibody) in cold FACS wash buffer.",
    "25. Wash the cells with 150 μl of FACS wash buffer. Centrifuge the plate 5 min at 450 × g, 4°C.\n26. Following centrifugation, discard supernatant by inverting the plate above a waste tray. Add 50 μl of cell-surface staining cocktail to the appropriate wells. Mix gently by pipetting up and down with a multichannel pipettor. Incubate the plate for 20 min, at 4°C, in the dark.\nBe careful not to add any more CD107 antibodies to this mix. CD107 staining only takes place during cell stimulation.\n27. Wash the cells twice, each time with 150 μl of FACS wash buffer. Centrifuge the plate 5 min at 450 × g, 4°C, following each wash.\nIntracellular antigen staining\n28. Following centrifugation, discard supernatant by inverting the plate above a waste tray. Following the BD Cytofix/Cytoperm “Alternative Fixation and Permeabilization Protocol” steps, resuspend cells in 100 µl of 4% paraformaldehyde solution. Incubate the plate for 20 min, at 4°C, in the dark.\nUsing this protocol instead of the regular fixation protocol (that employs the fixation/permeabilization solution) allows one to fix and store the cells for intracellular staining at a later time. Note that you can permeabilize with the fixation/permeabilization solution and proceed to the intracellular staining and flow cytometry acquisition right away.\n29. Wash the cells with 100 μl of FACS wash buffer. Centrifuge the plate 5 min at 650 × g, 4°C.\nNote that the cells are fixed at this point and thus require stronger centrifugation to pellet. Be sure to centrifuge at 650 × g for this and all following centrifugation steps.\n30. Following centrifugation, discard supernatant by inverting the plate above a waste tray. Wash the cells with 200 μl of FACS wash buffer. Centrifuge the plate 5 min at 650 × g, 4°C.",
    "31. Resuspend the cells in 200 µl of FACS wash buffer and place the plate covered with aluminum foil at 4°C (in the refrigerator) overnight.\n32. Centrifuge the plate 5 min at 650 × g, 4°C, and resuspend cells in 200 µl of 1× Perm/Wash buffer. Incubate the plate for 15 min, at 4°C, in the dark.\nDuring this incubation step, prepare the intracellular staining cocktail by mixing the appropriate dilutions of all antibodies (determined in advance by titration for each antibody) in cold Perm/Wash buffer.\n33. Centrifuge the plate 5 min at 650 × g, 4°C.\n34. Following centrifugation, discard supernatant by inverting the plate above a waste tray. Add 50 μl of intracellular staining cocktail to the appropriate wells. Mix gently by pipetting up and down with a multi-channel pipettor. Wrap plate in aluminum foil to protect from light and incubate for 45 min on ice.\n35. Wash the cells with 150 μl of Perm/Wash buffer. Centrifuge the plate 5 min at 650 × g, 4°C.\n36. Discard supernatant by inverting the plate above a waste tray. Wash two times the cells with 200 μl of Perm/Wash buffer. Centrifuge the plate 5 min at 650 × g, 4°C.\n37. Resuspend cells in 200 μl of FACS wash buffer. Filter cells using round-bottom polystyrene test tubes with cell-strainer snap cap right before flow cytometric analysis.\nCells should be read using a flow cytometer within 24 hr and results analyzed as in Figure 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-fig-0004].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/58e1f24f-6953-47d9-83d1-eb37339c47a6/cpz1515-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nDot-plots showing an example of CD107 and IFN-γ staining on CD8αβ intraepithelial lymphocytes from DQ8-Dd-villin-15tg mice gavaged with PBS (sham) or gluten for 30 days.",
    "Gluten proteins are the source of the immunogenic peptides that are the proximal triggers driving CeD pathogenesis. Following ingestion, these proteins are generally resistant to proteolytic degradation (Shan et al., 2002[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0071]). Yet, they are good substrates for transglutaminase 2 (TG2, a ubiquitous enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of selected glutamine residues in gluten peptides into glutamate; Arentz-Hansen et al., 2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0005]; Molberg et al., 1998[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0058]; van de Wal et al., 1998[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0079]), and thus promote the generation of immunogenic deamidated peptides that bind to HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 with much stronger affinity than native gluten peptides (Abadie et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0003]; Tollefsen et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0078]). Generation of highly disease-specific antibodies against deamidated gluten peptides and autoantibodies against TG2 itself is a hallmark of CeD (Dieterich et al., 1997[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0016]; Dieterich et al., 1998[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0017]; Husby et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0028]). Although TG2 is activated upon gluten and gliadin exposure in the DQ8-Dd-villin-IL-15tg mouse model, and one can measure the production of anti-deamidated gluten and gliadin peptide antibodies, the detection of circulating anti-TG2 antibodies has proven inconsistent, perhaps reflecting the absence of a mouse homolog of the human VH5-51 gene segment that recognizes TG2 in its germline configuration (Abadie et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0002]). This protocol describes how to detect and quantify TG2 activation and antibodies against both native and deamidated gliadin peptides in the DQ8-Dd-villin-IL-15tg mouse model of CeD.\nMaterials\nMice (including sham-fed and gluten-fed; see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-prot-0001])\n5–(biotinamido)-pentylamine (5-BP; Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 914134)\nTissue-Tek OCT embedding compound (Sakura Finetek)\n4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution (Alfa Aesar, cat. no.

To fix the section, immerse the slides in a Coplin jar or staining dish containing 1% PFA diluted in DPBS from the 4% stock solution for 30 min at room temperature.",
    "5a. Wash the slides three times in PBS, each time for 10 min under agitation using a rocker platform.\n6a. Draw a hydrophobic circle around the tissue section using a Pap pen.\n7a. Add IHC blocking solution and incubate for 1 hr at room temperature.\n8a. Tilt the slides to remove the solution and remove the remaining solution using Kimwipes.\n9a. Apply primary antibody against TG2 diluted at 1 μg/ml in IHC blocking solution in sufficient quantity to cover the tissue (∼ 300 μl per slide).\n10a.

Analyze the sections under a confocal microscope.\nTG2 activity can be quantified by estimating 5-BP and TG2 protein signal on a per-villi basis using analysis software. The results can be presented as the mean 5-BP signal/TG2 protein signal for each mouse.\nMeasurement of antibodies against native and deamidated gliadin peptides",
    "Both antibodies against native gliadin peptides and deamidated gliadin peptides can be measured by ELISA using different preparations of gliadin as antigen coating. Pepsin-trypsin digestion of gluten induces chemical deamidation (Molberg et al., 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0059]). Hence, an ELISA assay using pepsin-trypsin digested gliadin (PT-gliadin) will detect anti-gliadin antibodies directed against both native and deamidated gluten peptides, while TG2-treated chymotrypsin-digested gliadin (CT-gliadin) should be used to solely detect anti-deamidated gliadin antibodies.\n1b. Collect blood at the desired time points from sham-fed and gluten-fed mice. Allow the blood sample to clot and centrifuge 5 min at 1800 × g to further separate the serum from the clot and blood cells.\n2b. Coat ELISA 96-well plates with 50 μl of 100 μg/ml deamidated CT-gliadin or PTD-gliadin in 100 mM Na2HPO4 overnight at 4°C.\n3b.

Incubate overnight at 4°C.\nSerum is always assessed in duplicate and at two dilutions, typically 1/50 and 1/200 for this assay.\nA standard curve using purified mouse IgG or mouse IgA can be added to the plate to ascertain that the ELISA is working. To do so, make a 7-point standard curve, 2-fold serial dilutions starting from 50 ng/ml in 0.1M Na2HPO4. Add 100 μl of the diluent buffer to the wells set aside for the blanks.\n6b.

Cover the plate with aluminum foil, and incubate for 1 hr at room temperature. Use anti-mouse IgG-HRP or anti-mouse IgA-HRP to detect one or the other isotype.\n8b. Wash the plates five times with 250 μl of ELISA wash buffer.\n9b. Add 50 μl of the HRP substrate TMB per well. Monitor the appearance of a blue coloration and stop the reaction by adding 50 μl of 2 N H2SO4 that changes the color of the HRP-TMB byproduct from blue to yellow.\n10b.

Weigh out the desired number of 500 mg aliquots of gliadin in individual 50-ml polypropylene tubes.\nThese tubes will be boiled later, so be sure they can withstand boiling. Some control tubes that will not be treated with proteases are needed.\n2. Add 22.5 ml of Milli-Q water to each tube, followed by 2.5 ml of 10× Tris buffer and then 125 µl of 1 M CaCl2 solution (10 mM final concentration). Vortex well until gliadin is suspended (it will not dissolve, but the powder will be dispersed in the liquid and not sitting at the bottom of the tube).\n3. Place the tubes in a shaking incubator at 37°C for 30 min.\nThis step helps to suspend the gliadin.\n4. Dissolve the chymotrypsin to a concentration of 4 mg/ml in cold 1 mM HCl solution.\n5. After the suspended gliadin has pre-dissolved in the shaking incubator for 30 min, add chymotrypsin to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml by adding 1.25 ml of the 4 mg/ml chymotrypsin stock. For control tubes without protease, add 1.25 ml of 1 mM HCl.\n6. Vortex tube briefly and return to 37°C shaking incubator for 12 hr.",
    "After the digestion step, the control tubes left untreated should have visible clumps of gliadin either floating as a top layer, settled to the bottom of the tube, or both. There will still be a significant amount of undissolved material in the tubes with protease, but it should be clear that some gluten or gliadin has gone into solution.\n7. After digestion, quench by boiling (be careful—ensure caps are vented) at 95°–98°C for 10 min.\n8. Centrifuge the digests 10 min at 1800 × g to pellet insoluble, undigested gliadin.\n9. Dialyze the digests by pipetting 25 ml of the digests into one dialysis tubing. Seal the tubing with dialysis clamps. Dialyze at 4°C for 6–8 hr in dialysis buffer. Repeat the procedure with fresh dialysis buffer three times, with the last incubations lasting 12 hr.\nDetailed protocols for dialysis are found in Phillips & Signs (2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.515#cpz1515-bib-0064]).\nNote that enough tubing should be cut to hold approximately 40 ml of liquid, since the volume of the dialysis buffer in the bag will increase as dialysis proceeds. 2 L of dialysis buffer is required to dialyze 25 ml of digest.\n10. Transfer the digests into 50-ml polypropylene tubes that have been weighed beforehand.\n11. Flash freeze digests in liquid nitrogen and lyophilize to dryness (∼48 hr).\n12. Dissolve the digest in Milli-Q water and measure the absorbance at 280 nm using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. Calculate the concentration of a 2-µl aliquot using the extinction coefficient below, and dilute to the desired final concentration.\nExtinction coefficient (molar absorptivity) of gluten/gliadin peptides = 0.7 ml/cm*mg.\n13. To proceed to enzymatic deamidation using TG2, dissolve the CT-gliadin to 5.5 mg/ml in water.\n14. Add an appropriate volume of 10× digest buffer to bring the buffer concentration to 1×.",
    "This will also bring the gliadin concentration to 5.0 mg/ml.\n15. Add mTG2 such that the w/w ratio is 1:250. To negative control tubes, add 10× digest buffer alone. Mix by inverting the tubes.\n16. Incubate at 37°C for 1 hr with gentle shaking.\n17. Quench the digestion by boiling at 95°–98°C for 10 min (again making sure that the tubes are compatible with boiling).\n18. After cooling, centrifuge 5 min at 2300 × g in a tabletop centrifuge to pellet any TG2 that precipitated upon boiling. Freeze tubes, or continue directly with dialysis, as described above adjusting volumes depending on the volume that was used for the deamidation and control reactions.\n19. Resuspend the peptide solution at the desired concentration in water or PBS based on the mass of peptide that was used for the deamidation reaction. Vortex well and confirm the concentration as described in step 2.\nAliquots can be stored at −20°C for several weeks.",
