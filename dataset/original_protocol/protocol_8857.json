    "1. Preparing and Running the Gel\nPrepare the non-denaturing 12% polyacrylamide gel gels using the Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) recipe found in Sambrook and Russell14 but using water instead of SDS.\n\t\nTo prepare 5 mL of resolving gel, use 1.7 mL of distilled water, 2 mL of acrylamide/bis acrylamide (30/0.8% w/v), 1.3 mL of 1.5 M Tris pH 8.8, 0.05 mL of 10% ammonium persulfate, and 0.002 mL of TEMED.\nTo prepare 2 mL of stacking gel use 1.5 mL of water, 0.33 mL of acrylamide/bis acrylamide (30/0.8% w/v), 0.25 mL of 1 M Tris pH 6.8, 0.02 mL of 10% ammonium persulfate, and 0.002 mL of TEMED. The dimensions of the gel are 7.3 cm x 8.2 cm x 0.075 cm (l x w x d).\nNote: Use a 15 well comb of 0.75 mm thickness for the best sensitivity.\nAdd the appropriate amounts of 6x loading buffer and DNA sample to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube (e.g. use 1 µL of 6x loading buffer to 5 µL of DNA sample).\nPlace the gel in the vertical electrophoresis chamber.\n\t\nFill the chamber with 750 mL of 1x TAE buffer to run 2 gels. To prepare 1 L of 50x TAE, use 442 g of Tris base, 57.1 mL of glacial acetic acid, and 100 mL of 0.5 M EDTA pH 8. Add distilled water to a final volume of 1 L.\nLoad the samples in the gel. Run the gel at 100 V for 2 h.\nAlternatively, prepare a 1x TAE agarose gel using the recipe found in Sambrook14.\n\t\nAdd 300 mL of 1x TAE to the horizontal electrophoresis chamber. Run the gel for 45 min at 100 V.\n2. NBT-SG I Staining (Figure 1).\nAcrylamide Gel Staining.",
    "Prepare the solutions: 0.1% w/v NBT and 1.2x SG I.\nNote: It is possible to use ethidium bromide, GelRed and SYBR Gold instead of SG I, but SG I had the best performance.\nPour 16.75 mL of 1.2x SYBR Green I solution into a container of appropriate size.\nNote: We used the lid of a pipette tip box as a container, and these volumes are calculated to cover the gel using this container; its dimensions are 11.6 cm x 7.6 cm x 2.6 cm (l x w x d).\nPlace the gel in the solution. Add 3.25 mL of 0.1% w/v NBT solution to give 0.2 mM NBT and 1x (equivalent to 2.0 µM) SG I final concentrations.\nSeal the container with plastic film, and completely wrap the container with aluminum foil to block any ambient light.\nNote: The plastic film is used to prevent splashing and to avoid reaction of the aluminum foil with the staining solution.\nShake for 25 min on an orbital shaker at 60 rpm.\nRemove aluminum and plastic cover. Expose to sunlight for 90 min maximum. Check every 5 min until the band of interest appears.\nTo use blue light, prepare a protoboard with 3 Light-Emitting Diodes (LED) and place the LEDs about 5 mm from the gel surface (check the staining continuously, as the time needed will depend on the intensity of the LED light source).\nAgarose Gel Staining.\nAfter preparing and running a 1% agarose gel as described in sections 1.4 (the dimensions are 1 cm x 6.2 cm x 7 cm; l x w x d), follow the same steps as in 2.1 with these modifications:",
    "Pour 41.9 mL of 1.2x SG I solution into the lid of a pipette tip box; its dimensions are 11.6 cm x 7.6 cm x 2.6 cm (l x w x d). Add 8.1 mL of 0.1% NBT solution.\nSeal the container with plastic film, and then completely wrap the container with aluminum foil to block any ambient light.\nShake for 1 h on an orbital shaker at 60 rpm.\n3. Data Analysis.\nNBT-SG I Calibration Curves.\nObtain gel images by scanning at 1200 dpi.\nOpen software for image analysis. Straighten the images using an image editor. Run an image densitometry.\nCalculate the area under the curve. Prepare a graph of Signal/SignalMax versus DNA concentration.\n4. DNA Recovery.\nPrepare a 1% agarose gel in 1x TAE using the recipe found in Sambrook14.\nAdd 300 mL of 1x TAE to the horizontal electrophoresis chamber. Load 4 µL of 100 ng/µL pDJ10015 plasmid and DNA ladder following the scheme given in Figure 2. Run the gel for 1 h at 100 V.\nMark and weigh two 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nCut the gel down the middle in order to have two identical halves. Each one should contain the ladder and the sample plasmid to compare the different staining techniques. A schematic representation is in Figure 2.\nStain one half with NBT-SG I as in step 2.\n\t\nCut out the plasmid band using a clean scalpel. Save the gel piece in one tube and weigh.\nStain the other part of the gel with SG I with 50 mL of 1x SG I solution and slowly shake (60 rpm) the gel for 1 h in darkness.\n\t\nPlace the gel on a transilluminator and expose for 2 min. Cut out the plasmid band using a clean scalpel.",
    "Save the gel piece in the other tube and weigh.\nNote: The protocol can be paused here while keeping the tubes at -20 °C.\nCarry out plasmid extraction using a commercial gel extraction kit.\n5. Plasmid Normalization.\nIn a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, add 10 µL of extracted plasmid and 60 µL of type I water. Mix and transfer to a 60 µL quartz cuvette or use 2 µL directly in a Nanodrop.\nMeasure absorption spectra between 230 to 320 nm. Calculate the sample's plasmid concentration using the following formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56528/56528eq1v3.jpg\n\twhere D is the dilution factor applied (in this case it is 70/10), Ax is absorption at x nm, and 50 is the conversion factor to µg/mL for dsDNA.\nDilute samples to 9.1 ng/µL.\nTransform Escherichia coli (E. coli) competent cells (e.g. XL10 Gold) following the Inoue transformation procedure16 using 5 µL of dilute sample.\nCount the number of colonies on the Petri dishes and note the dilution. Calculate the Colony Forming Units (CFU) with the following formula17:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56528/56528eq2v2.jpg\n\twhere D is the dilution factor applied from the initial culture.\nPerform an unpaired t-test.\nSubscription Required.
