    "In cultured mammalian cells, as well as tissue slices and tissues in vivo, the stoichiometry of O-GlcNAc moieties per protein molecule can be increased by treating cells/tissues/animals with inhibitors of O-GlcNAcase. Several inhibitors exist (Dennis et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0014]; Kim, Kang, Love, & Hanover, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0048]; Macauley, Whitworth, Debowski, Chin, & Vocadlo, 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0057]; Shanmugasundaram et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0076]; Yuzwa et al., 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0096]), although only PUGNAc (Toronto Research Chemicals; Haltiwanger, 1998[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0029]) and Thiamet-G (Cayman Chemicals; Yuzwa et al., 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0096]) are commercially available. Unlike Thiamet-G, PUGNAc also inhibits lysosomal hexosaminidases. Several OGT inhibitors have been developed (Gross, Kraybill, & Walker, 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0027]). Although these initial inhibitors were demonstrated to work in neonatal cardiomyocytes (1-5 μM; Ngoh et al., 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0065]) and breast cancer cells (500 μM; Caldwell et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0008]), recent data suggests that they react with the protein backbone, limiting their utility (Jiang, Lazarus, Pasquina, Sliz, & Walker, 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0043]). Recently, high-throughput screening led to the development of a small-molecule OGT inhibitor, OSMI-1, that is cell permeable (Ortiz-Meoz et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0066]). Further structure-based evolution of OSMI-1 yielded three additional compounds, OSMI-2, -3, and -4, with higher affinities for OGT (Martin et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0058]). One alternative strategy has been to use cell-permeable compounds that are metabolized by the cell to generate non-hydrolyzable analogs of UDP-GlcNAc. Examples include Ac45SGlcNAc (effective in cells; Gloster et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0024]) or 5SGlcNHex (effective in animals; Liu et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0054]). However, it is important to note that OGT inhibitors that mimic UDP-GlcNAc are likely to affect other enzymes that utilize UDP-GlcNAc as a substrate. Streptozotocin (STZ; Roos et al., 1998[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0071]), glucosamine (Han, Oh, & Kudlow, 2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0033]), and the glutamine fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT) inhibitors 6-diazo-5-oxonorleucine (DON) and azaserine have also been used to alter the stoichiometry of O-GlcNAc on proteins.",
    "However, STZ has been shown to induce poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase–mediated apoptosis in Min6 cells (Gao, Parker, & Hart, 2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0022]) and should be used with caution. STZ and glucosamine treatments are most effective in cells that express the glucose transporter GLUT-2 (Schnedl, Ferber, Johnson, & Newgard, 1994[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0074]). Notably, inhibitors of GFAT can have off-target effects on other glutamine-utilizing enzymes. Benzyl-α-GalNAc and benzyl-β-GlcNAc, which have been reported to inhibit OGT, should be avoided, as these have been characterized as inhibitors of prototypical O-GalNAc-type glycosylation. Care should be taken when using inhibitors of OGT and OGA, as treatment at too high a dose or for too long can affect the maturation of the mRNAs encoding OGT and OGA and thus protein expression (Park et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0067]; Tan et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0081]).",

Grow cells in monolayer culture in a sufficient number of 100-mm dishes.\n2. Add (or replace) growth medium with fresh medium containing 0.1-1 μM Thiamet-G (added from 1 mM stock), 10-100 μM PUGNAc (added from 100 mM stock), or 5 mM glucosamine (added from 500 mM stock). Incubate the cells in a humidified water-jacket CO2 incubator at 37°C for 4-18 hr.\nTreatments should be optimized for the desired cell type for 4-18 hr. Longer treatments alter the expression of OGT and OGA, as well as leading to significant toxicity (Slawson et al., 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0079]).\nThe vehicle is either 1 M HEPES, PBS, or 0.5 M HEPES, pH 7.5.\nWhen using glucosamine, mannitol is often added to the controls at the same concentration. The use of mannitol controls for changes in osmolarity due to the additional sugar in the medium (Heart, Choi, & Sung, 2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0038]).\n3. At the end of treatment, take the dishes out of the incubator and place on ice. Extract as desired. Separate proteins by SDS-PAGE and electroblot onto an appropriate membrane (Gallagher, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0021]).\nAlternatively, extract proteins and proceed with protein purification or immunoprecipitation (Bonifacino, Dell'Angelica, & Springer, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0003]).",
    "Several antibodies have been developed that recognize terminal GlcNAc residues or the O-GlcNAc modification (Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-tbl-0001]). Additionally, site-specific O-GlcNAc antibodies have been raised against glycosylation sites on proteins including c-Myc (Kamemura, Hayes, Comer, & Hart, 2002[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0044]), tau (Cameron et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0009]; Yuzwa et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0098]), SirT1 (Shan et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0075]), and CRMP2 (Muha et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0063]), as well as IRS2 and a subset of histones (H2A, H2B, H3, H4; available from GlycoScientific). These tools allow researchers to probe the O-GlcNAc modification state of key proteins without first purifying the protein. Site-specific antibodies are not discussed further because they are not widely available. When using O-GlcNAc pan-specific antibodies (antibodies that recognize O-GlcNAc linked to Ser/Thr residues) or GlcNAc pan-specific antibodies (antibodies that recognize any terminal β-GlcNAc residue, including those linked to longer glycan structures), it is important to run appropriate controls, as some antibodies cross-react with peptide sequences that mimic GlcNAc residues (Shikhman, Greenspan, & Cunningham, 1994[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0078]), whereas others have some dependence on the peptide backbone (Holt et al., 1987[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0040]; Snow, Senior, & Gerace, 1987[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0080]). Appropriate controls include: (1) elevating O-GlcNAc levels in tissue culture using inhibitors of the O-GlcNAcase or glucosamine (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-prot-0001]); (2) lowering O-GlcNAcylation in tissue culture cells using inhibitors of OGT or the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway; (3) removing O-GlcNAc from samples in vitro using hexosaminidase (see Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.",
    "129#cpz1129-prot-0008]); (4) elevating the levels of O-GlcNAc in tissue culture by overexpressing OGT or performing RNA interference (RNAi) of O-GlcNAcase; (5) lowering O-GlcNAcylation by overexpressing O-GlcNAcase or performing RNAi of OGT; (6) treating lysates with PNGase F to remove N-linked glycans; (7) using appropriate purified control proteins, such as ovalbumin, which bears N-linked glycans with terminal GlcNAc residues, or synthetic neoglycoconjugates, such as BSA-aminophenyl-GlcNAc (BSA-AP-GlcNAc); or (8) competing away antibody binding with free GlcNAc that controls for nonspecific binding and cross-reactivity with endogenous immunoglobulin.",

Modulating O-GlcNAc levels is an appropriate control.\nUsing the Millipore Sigma Immobilon Western Enhanced Chemiluminescent (ECL) Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) Substrate system, the authors have found that 10 μg of nuclear or total cell extract is sufficient. However, 20-30 μg of cell extract provides the highest quality data. For the detection of O-GlcNAc from tissue samples, the authors have established that 25-30 μg of total tissue lysate is required for detection using CTD110.6. For detection using the RL2 antibody, 15-20 μg of tissue lysate is sufficient to be within the linear range of detection using the aforementioned ECL system. For purified proteins, Comer and co-workers found that 25-50 ng of a neoglycoconjugate was sufficient (Comer, Vosseller, Wells, Accavitti, & Hart, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0013]).

A table summarizing conditions for a subset of commercial antibodies is included; the protocols are similar to that for CTD110.6 (Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-tbl-0002]).\nTable 2.\n                Conditions for Some Common Commercial Antibodies\ntable:\n﻿Primary antibody,Blocka[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-tbl2-note-0001_92],Primary concentration,Primary buffer,Secondary antibody,Secondary buffera[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-tbl2-note-0001_93],GlcNAc competition\nCTD110.6,3% milk,1 μg/ml,3% BSA,Mouse anti-IgM,3% BSA,100 mM",

    "Commercially available CTD110.6 is purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation. Thus, it may be necessary to titrate antibody concentration when using a new lot number. Typically, we find that 1 μg/ml is a good place to start. For the detection of O-GlcNAc in tissue lysates, we find that higher concentrations of CTD110.6 are necessary.\nTo control for specificity, it is important to perform a control blot. Here, the antibody is preincubated with 100 mM GlcNAc for ∼5 min on ice before being applied to the control blot. This control is most important when probing immunoprecipitations and tissue lysates that may contain immunoglobulin. Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-tbl-0002] reports the concentration of free GlcNAc to use for other O-GlcNAc antibodies.\n4.

Wash the blots with 25 ml TBST four times, each time for 10 min at room temperature.\n7. Wash the blots with 25 ml TBS once, for 10 min at room temperature.\n8. Develop the HRP reaction using, e.g., the ECL system (Gallagher, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0021]).\nCTD110.6 should bind BSA-AP-GlcNAc, but not BSA-AP. A number of bands in total cell lysate should be detected, predominantly over 40 kDa. Treatment with Thiamet-G should elevate the levels of O-GlcNAc 2- to 3-fold on numerous proteins in total cell lysate. Reactivity toward both BSA-GlcNAc and total cell lysate should be completely competed away by free GlcNAc. Note that the antibody often cross-reacts with prestained markers.",
    "Many lectins are reportedly specific for β-GlcNAc residues. The authors have typically used succinylated wheat germ agglutinin (sWGA), which is widely available and is derivatized with a number of useful functional groups including HRP. Before succinylation, WGA will recognize both sialic acid and GlcNAc (Monsigny et al., 1979[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0061]). For additional information concerning lectin chromatography, see Freeze (2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0019]).\nThe amount of “test” protein used is dependent on the technique(s) used to develop the HRP reaction. Using the Millipore Sigma Immobilon Western Enhanced Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate system, the authors find that 15 μg of cytoplasmic or nuclear extract is sufficient, but 20-30 μg of protein produces the best data.\nIt is important to include an appropriate positive (100 ng ovalbumin) and negative (100 ng BSA) control. As a control, a portion of the sample should also be treated with hexosaminidase (see Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-prot-0006]), to show that reactivity is toward GlcNAc. Alternatively, the levels of O-GlcNAc can be manipulated in cell culture (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-prot-0001]). An additional control is to subject the blot to mild reductive β-elimination to verify that lectin/antibody reactivity is towards O-linked glycans (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-prot-0004]), rather than N-linked glycans.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Volumes are given for 9 × 14-cm membranes washed in 10.5 × 15.5-cm boxes.

A number of bands, predominantly over 40 kDa, in total cell lysate should be detected. Treatment with Thiamet-G should elevate the levels of O-GlcNAc 2- to 3-fold on numerous proteins in total cell lysate. Reactivity toward BSA-GlcNAc, ovalbumin, and total cell lysate should be completely competed away by free GlcNAc. Using the ECL system described, 100 ng of ovalbumin should be visualized in 5-15 s.",
    "Traditionally, mild alkaline reduction (reductive β-elimination) has been used to release O-linked carbohydrates from proteins (Amano & Kobata, 1989[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0001]). This method has been adapted for blots to show that lectin/antibody reactivity is toward O-linked rather than N-linked glycans (Duk, Ugorski, & Lisowska, 1997[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0016]). Proteins blotted to PVDF are treated with 55 mM NaOH overnight (releasing O-linked sugars) and then probed using lectins or antibodies (Reeves, Lee, Henry, & Zachara, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0070]). The authors note that this protocol will not differentiate between O-GlcNAc and other forms of O-linked glycosylation.\nThere are a number of reasons why lectin/antibody reactivity could be lost after NaOH treatment, e.g., the sugars were destroyed instead of being released, or the protein was degraded. To control for these, it is important to have control proteins with N- and O-linked sugars, and to stain one blot for protein after treatment, preferably with an antibody. The authors suggest a control blot of bovine asialofetuin (Millipore Sigma), which contains both N- and O-linked sugars terminating in GlcNAc, treated and not treated with PNGase F (Powell, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0068]).\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Volumes are given for 9 × 14-cm membranes washed in 10.5 × 15.5-cm boxes.

On the treated blot, only the asialofetuin without PNGase F should react with sWGA.",
    "WGA lectin affinity chromatography provides a convenient method for enriching and detecting O-GlcNAc-modified proteins. This procedure has been adapted for detecting proteins that are difficult to purify or are present in low copy numbers, such as transcription factors. In this protocol, the protein of interest is synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) in vitro transcription-translation (TNT) system (Promega) and labeled with either [35S]Met, [35S]Cys, or [14C]Leu. After desalting, the proteins are tested for their ability to bind WGA-agarose in a GlcNAc-specific manner (Roquemore, Chou, & Hart, 1994[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0072]). This protocol is readily adapted to purifying proteins from cell extracts, but, as WGA binds proteins with both terminal GlcNAc and sialic acid residues, typically one would purify proteins from nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts to avoid co-purifying proteins with prototypical glycans.\nAlternatively, the lectin Ricinus communis agglutinin 1 (RCA1) has been used to select for O-GlcNAc proteins that have previously been labeled by galactosyltransferase (see Alternate Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-prot-0007]). Proteins modified by terminal Gal are specifically retained on an RCA1 affinity column. Labeled O-GlcNAc-modified proteins are released under mild conditions, whereas those containing N-linked structures require lactose addition to the buffer before elution results (Greis & Hart, 1998[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0025]; Hayes, Greis, & Hart, 1995[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0037]). The method described in this protocol can be adapted for RCA1 affinity chromatography by substituting RCA1-agarose (Vector Laboratories) for WGA-agarose and changing the order of the Gal and GlcNAc elution buffer. In choosing a label to use, ensure that the labeled amino acid is well represented in your protein of interest, although [35S]Met is usually the most cost-effective and sensitive choice.\nMaterials\ncDNA subcloned into an expression vector with an SP6 or T7 promoter (∼0.5-1 μg/μl)\nTNT Lysate Systems kit (Promega)\nLabel: [35S]Met, [35S]Cys, or [14C]Leu\nWGA-agarose (Vector Laboratories; AL1023)",

    "The volumes given are appropriate for a sample derived from a TNT reaction. For enrichment of other protein samples, the volume of WGA should be optimized for the protein sample applied.

Apply the sample (∼30 μl of an TNT reaction) to the column and let stand at 4°C for 30 min, or cap and incubate at 4°C for 30 min with rotating or rocking.\nSave a small amount (1%) of the starting material as a control to count and to run on a gel.\nWash the column and elute GlcNAc\n6.

    "To precipitate proteins with methanol, mix 1 vol of sample with 10 vol of ice-cold methanol. Incubate overnight at −20°C. Recover protein by centrifuging for 10 min at 16,000 × g, 4°C, in a microcentrifuge tube (which is the most efficient procedure) or in 15-ml conical centrifuge tubes for 10 min at 3000 × g, 4°C.

Typically, a fraction of the GlcNAc elution containing a total of 1000-2000 dpm [35S]Met is precipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Gallagher, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0021]).\nThe use of acetone to precipitate proteins is not recommended, as free GlcNAc will also precipitate.\n12.

    "The enzyme β-1,4-galactosyltransferase (from bovine milk) will label any terminal GlcNAc residue with Gal, using uridine diphospho-D-Gal (UDP-Gal) as a donor substrate (Brew, Vanaman, & Hill, 1968[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0005]). Hart and colleagues have exploited this property, using the enzyme to label terminal GlcNAc residues on proteins with [6-3H]Gal, forming a [3H]βGal1-4βGlcNAc (Greis et al., 1996[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0026]; Roquemore et al., 1994[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0072]; Torres & Hart, 1984[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0085]). The labeled sugar can be chemically released (via β-elimination) and analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography on a BioGel-P4 column, using the 3H radiolabel to detect the fraction of interest (Roquemore et al., 1994[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0072]). Labeling the O-GlcNAc residue allows the subsequent detection of proteins and peptides of interest during SDS-PAGE, HPLC, protease digestion, and Edman degradation steps. Researchers have been able to identify glycosylation sites on as little as 10 pmol using these methods (Greis et al., 1996[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0026]). Recently, this technique has been adapted to allow the incorporation of unnatural sugar analogs that can be derivatized to facilitate either the purification or detection of O-GlcNAc-modified proteins and peptides (Kim, 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0047]), a technique that is marketed by Invitrogen under the “Click-it” brand (Invitrogen).\nTo achieve efficient labeling of some proteins, it is necessary to denature samples, for example by boiling in the presence of 10 mM DTT and 0.5% (w/v) SDS. Galactosyltransferase has been shown to be active in solutions containing 5 mM DTT, 0.5 M NaCl, up to 2% (v/v) Triton X-100, up to 2% (v/v) NP-40, and 1 M urea. Up to 0.5% (w/v) SDS can be used if it is titrated with a 10-fold molar excess of either Triton X-100 or NP-40 in the final reaction mixture. Digitonin, which is commonly used to solubilize cells, should be used with caution, as it is a substrate for galactosyltransferase. The total ionic strength should be <0.2 M.",
    "Galactosyltransferase requires 1-5 mM Mn2+ for activity but is inhibited by Mg2+ and concentrations of Mn2+ >20 mM. EDTA (or analogs) should be avoided unless titrated with appropriate levels of Mn2+. Note that 1 mole of EDTA binds 2 moles of Mn2+.\nFree UDP is also an inhibitor of galactosyltransferase. For studies where complete labeling of the GlcNAc is preferable, such as site mapping, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase is included in the reaction, as it degrades UDP (Unverzagt et al., 1990[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0120]). Although this increases the efficiency of the reaction, it is important to add this to the control, as some preparations of alkaline phosphatase contain proteins that will label with galactosyltransferase (R.N. Cole, pers. commun.).\nNOTE: Protease inhibitors, such as PIC 1, PIC 2, and PMSF (see the recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-rec-0004] for 1000× protease inhibitors in Reagents and Solutions), can be included (final concentrations, 1×), but GlcNAc and 1-amino-GlcNAc should be removed prior to labeling by spin filtration or another method of desalting.\nMaterials\nProtein sample(s)\nDithiothreitol (DTT)\nSodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS; see Moore, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0062], for 20% stock solution)\nLabel: 1.0 mCi/ml UDP-[3H]Gal (17.6 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals) in 70% (v/v) ethanol\n25 mM 5′-adenosine monophosphate (5′-AMP) in Milli-Q water, pH 7.0\nBuffer H (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-rec-0002])\n10× galactosyltransferase labeling buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-rec-0005])\nGalactosyltransferase, autogalactosylated (see Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-prot-0008])\nCalf intestinal alkaline phosphatase\nUnlabeled UDP-Gal\nStop solution: 10% (w/v) SDS/0.1 M EDTA\n30 × 1-cm Sephadex G-50 column equilibrated in 50 mM ammonium formate/0.1% (w/v) SDS\n100°C water bath\nSpeed-Vac evaporator or nitrogen source\n37°C incubator\nLiquid scintillation counter\nAdditional reagents and equipment for acetone precipitation of protein (Lovrien & Matulis, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0055]), PNGase F digestion of proteins (Powell, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0068]), SDS-PAGE (Gallagher, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0021]), and product analysis (see Basic Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-prot-0010])\nPrepare the reaction",

Collect 1-ml fractions.\nThe column dimensions should be 1 × 30 cm, and the flow rate between 0.4 and 1 ml/min. Note: Slower flow rates result in greater resolution. This step should be performed at room temperature.\nSize-exclusion chromatography using Sephadex G-50 (∼30 cm) is traditionally used to desalt samples. However, TCA precipitation, spin filtration/buffer exchange, or other forms of size-exclusion chromatography (e.g., Cytiva Life Sciences PD-10 desalting column) can be used. The addition of carrier proteins, such as BSA (∼67 kDa) and cytochrome c (∼12.5 kDa), to samples and buffers will reduce the amount of protein lost due to nonspecific protein adsorption.\n10. Count a 50-μl aliquot of each fraction using a liquid scintillation counter.\nApproximately 2 × 106 dpm of [3H]Gal should be incorporated into 2 μg of ovalbumin.\n11.

    "The detection and analysis of O-GlcNAc on proteins is only the first step in the analysis of O-GlcNAc and the protein(s) of interest. More important is determining the function of the modification. Protocols for the analysis of the enzymes that add and remove O-GlcNAc have been included in this unit, as they may aid in understanding the role of O-GlcNAc in a particular model.

OGT activity is assayed by determining the rate at which [3H]GlcNAc is transferred to an acceptor peptide. A number of peptides have been identified as substrates for OGT in vitro, but a peptide (340PGGSTPVSSANMM352) from the α-subunit of casein kinase II (CKII) is an efficient in vitro substrate that is commonly used (Kreppel & Hart, 1999[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0051]).",
    "OGT activity can be assayed in crude preparations (Haltiwanger et al., 1990[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0031]) or using recombinant protein (Kreppel & Hart, 1999[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0051]). OGT activity is sensitive to salt inhibition and reducing agents, so it is important to desalt the preparation before assaying if high salt concentrations are present (see Support Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-prot-0013]). Typically, 0.2-1 μg of purified recombinant protein is used per assay. To assay OGT activity in cell/tissue lysate, 10-50 μg of desalted lysate is required per assay.\nMaterials\n0.1 mCi/ml UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (20-45 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals) in 70% (v/v) ethanol\n25 mM 5′-adenosine monophosphate (5′-AMP), in Milli-Q water, pH 7.0\nCrude or purified OGT sample, desalted (see Support Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-prot-0013])\n10× OGT assay buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-rec-0008])\nCKII peptide substrate (OGT peptide): +H2N-PGGSTPVSSANMM-COO− (custom synthesized and dissolved in H2O to 10 mM, with pH adjusted to 7, if necessary)\n0.5 mM Thiamet-G in 0.5 M HEPES, pH 7.5\n20 U/μl calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (18009019; Thermo Fisher Scientific)\nQuenching buffer: 50 mM formic acid/500 mM NaCl\n50 mM formic acid\nAcetone\nMethanol (HPLC-grade)\nScintillation fluid\nSpeed-Vac evaporator or nitrogen source\nClear round-bottom 96-well plate\nStrata C18 96-well plate (25 mg/well; 8E-S001-CGB; Phenomenex)\nScintillation counter\n1.

Resuspend in an appropriate volume of 25 mM 5′-AMP, so that the concentration is 1 μCi/μl.\n5′-AMP is included in the assay to competitively inhibit any pyrophosphatase in the sample that will hydrolyze the UDP-GlcNAc.\n2. Prepare a master mix containing each of the following per reaction:\n         \n5 μl of 10× OGT assay buffer\n5 μl of 10 mM CKII peptide substrate\n0.5 μl 1 μCi/μl UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (0.5 μCi per reaction)\n1 μl of 0.5 mM Thiamet-G",
    "0.25 μl of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (5 U per reaction)\nH2O to 20 μl.\nOGT is feedback inhibited by a byproduct of the reaction, UDP. Calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase degrades UDP and hence increases the efficiency of the reaction.\n3. Array master mix in a clear round-bottom 96-well plate and initiate reactions by adding 30 μl of desalted OGT.\nIt is critical to include a negative control. A mimic of the CKII peptide in which the Ser and Thr residues are replaced with Ala is appropriate, or, simply, a “no-peptide” control can be included.\nRecombinant His-OGT purified in house and diluted in desalting buffer is included as a positive control.\nThe results generated are variable and the reactions should be set up in triplicate.\n4. Incubate for 30 min to 1 hr at room temperature.\nAn incubation time of 15-30 min at room temperature is usually sufficient.\n5. Stop the reaction by adding 150 μl quenching buffer.\n6. Activate a C18 96-well plate (Phenomonex; 25 mg resin/well) with 100% acetone (1.5 ml). Once the acetone has passed through the columns, add methanol (1.5 ml). Finally, equilibrate the columns by adding 1.5 ml quenching buffer; repeat two more times.\nPlates can be reused up to ten times; however, plates should be precycled (by performing steps 6 and 7) before use.\nIt is also possible to use Sep-Pak C18 cartridges. The method is similar to that described below.\n7. Load the reaction (200 μl total) onto the 96-well plate. Wash the plate sequentially with quenching buffer, water, and 50 mM formic acid (two times with 1.5 ml each).\nThe CKII peptide binds to the C18 resin. Unincorporated UDP-[3H]GlcNAc is eliminated by the wash.\n8. Elute the peptide with 1.5 ml of 100% methanol.",
    "9. Add 0.75 ml of the eluate to 5 ml scintillation fluid and count 3H. Calculate OGT activity as peptide micromoles of GlcNAc incorporated, per minute per milligram of protein.\nNotably, for UDP-GlcNAc with a specific activity of 60 Ci/mmol, 1000 dpm represents 7.54 fmol of GlcNAc added.",
    "OGT activity is sensitive to salt inhibition (IC50 = 40-50 mM NaCl). It is important to desalt the enzyme preparation before setting up the assay if a high concentration of salt is present. Additionally, O-GlcNAcase activity is sensitive to detergent present in extraction buffers. The protocol described below is also used to desalt O-GlcNAcase before setting up assay reactions.\nMaterials\nOGT desalting buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-rec-0009])\nSample: volume range 20-100 μl\nZeba 96-well Spin Desalting Plates, 40K MWCO (87774; Thermo Fisher Scientific)\n96-well wash plates\n96-well collection plates\nIce\n1. Place the desalting plate on top of the wash plate and centrifuge 2 min at 1000 × g, 4°C, to remove the storage solution.\n2. Discard the flowthrough and replace the desalting plate onto the wash plate.\n3. Add 250 μl desalting buffer on top of the resin. Centrifuge and discard flowthrough. Repeat this step two additional times.\nAfter each spin, make sure resin appears white and free of liquid. Incomplete centrifugation may lead to poor sample recovery.\n4. Blot the bottom of the desalting plate to remove excess liquid and place it on top of a new collection plate.\n5. Load the protein sample (20-100 μl) onto the resin. Centrifuge 3 min at 1000 × g, 4°C, and retain the flowthrough that contains the sample.\nAlternatively, Zeba Spin Desalting Columns, 7K MWCO columns (Thermo Fisher Scientific), PD-10 columns (Millipore Sigma), or G50 Sephadex columns (Cytiva Life Sciences) can be used.",
    "O-GlcNAcase, also known as N-acetylglucosaminidase or hexosaminidase C (EC 3.2.1.52), is a cytosolic glycosidase specific for O-linked β-GlcNAc. The activity of O-GlcNAcase can be conveniently assayed in vitro with a fluorogenic substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl-GlcNAc (4MU-β-GlcNAc). The cleavage product, 4-methylumbelliferone (4MU), is fluorescent with an emission at 460 nm (Macauley et al., 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0057]).\nMaterials\nPurified O-GlcNAcase (0.2-1 μg) or cell/tissue extract (10-50 μg, desalted; see annotation following step 1)\n10× O-GlcNAcase assay buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-rec-0007])\n1 M GalNAc\n100 mM 4MU-βGlcNAc in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Millipore Sigma, M2133)\n100 mM 4MU-βGalNAc in DMSO (Millipore Sigma, M9659)\nOGT desalting buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-rec-0009])\nFree 4MU standards: 100 mM 4MU in DMSO\nPositive control: 5000 U/ml β-N-acetylhexosaminidasef (New England Biolabs, P0721)\nQuenching buffer: 200 mM glycine, pH 10.75\nBlack flat-bottomed 96-well plate and sealing tape\nCentrifuge, 4°C\n37°C incubator\nPlate reader\n1. Prepare O-GlcNAcase.\nNative or recombinant O-GlcNAcase can be partially purified from animal tissues or cultured cells by several chromatographic steps (Dong & Hart, 1994[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0015]; Gao, Wells, Comer, Parker, & Hart, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0023]). Alternatively, a crude enzyme preparation can be generated by passing cell extract over a 1-ml concanavalin A (Con-A) column. Most of the interfering acidic hexosaminidases are modified by N-linked sugars and bind to Con-A, whereas neutral O-GlcNAcase will be found in the flowthrough (Izumi & Suzuki, 1983[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-bib-0042]). Additionally, O-GlcNAcase activity is sensitive to detergent present in extraction buffers. Therefore, cell/tissue extracts or enzyme preparations should be desalted (see Support Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.129#cpz1129-prot-0013]) before the assay reaction is set up. Free GalNAc is used in the assay to inhibit lysosomal hexosaminidases. The lysates are assayed against both 4MU-βGlcNAc and 4MU-βGalNAc, the latter to confirm that lysosomal hexosaminidases have been effectively inhibited.\n2. Precool a 96-well plate or microcentrifuge tubes on ice.",
    "3. Set up reactions in triplicate in the precooled plate wells or tubes by adding 20 μl partially purified O-GlcNAcase enzyme or cell/tissue extract to each well or tube as appropriate.\n20 μl of desalting buffer is used as a negative control. 4MU-GlcNAc breaks down chemically, and therefore blank reaction without enzyme is included to determine the background. 20 μl of β-N-acetylhexosaminidasef (diluted to 25 U/ml in desalting buffer) is used as a positive control.\n4. Prepare a master mix containing each of the following per sample:\n         \n5 μl 10× O-GlcNAcase assay buffer\n5 μl 1 M GalNAc\n0.5 μl 4MU-GlcNAc\n19.5 μl H2O.\n50 mM GalNAc (final) is included in the reaction to inhibit lysosomal hexosaminidases A and B that may be present in the enzyme preparation. O-GlcNAcase is not inhibited by 50 mM GalNAc.\nPrepare a similar master mix containing 4MU-GalNAc instead of 4MU-GlcNAc as a substrate.\n4MU-GalNAc acts as a negative control substrate that allows an assessment of the activity of any contaminating lysosomal hexosaminidases.\n5. Add 30 µl of the appropriate master mix to each sample.\n6. Prepare a 4MU standard curve (0-10 nmol) in DMSO. Add 50 μl of each dilution to separate wells in triplicate.\n7. Quench one reaction of the three from every triplicate reaction set up at time point zero by adding 150 μl quenching buffer (200 mM glycine, pH 10.75).\nThis is done to determine the background cleavage of 4MU-GlcNAc that is not due to O-GlcNAcase activity.\n8. Mix well and cover.\n9. Incubate 30-60 min at 37°C.\nReactions should be optimized to keep the fluorescence intensity within the linear range of the plate reader. The authors find that 10-50 μg of cell/tissue extract used in a reaction of 50 μl, with a 1-hr incubation time, is appropriate.",
    "10. At the end of the incubation, add 150 μl quenching buffer (200 mM glycine, pH 10.75) to the remaining reactions, including the 4MU standards.\n11. Read the fluorescence intensity with an excitation wavelength at 368 nm and an emission wavelength of 450 nm on a plate reader.\n12. Calculate O-GlcNAcase activity according to the following equation:\n         formula:\n\\begin{eqnarray*} &amp;&amp;{\\rm{Moles}}\\;{\\rm{of}}\\;{\\rm{GlcNAc}}\\; {\\rm {or}}\\; {\\rm{GalNAc}}\\;{\\rm{released}} \\\\[-3pt] &amp;&amp; \\quad = [\\left( {{\\rm{average}}\\;{\\rm{fluorescence}}\\;{\\rm{intensity}}\\;{\\rm{after}}\\;60\\;{\\rm{min}}} \\right)\\\\[-3pt] &amp;&amp; \\qquad - \\left( {{\\rm{fluorescence}}\\;{\\rm{intensity}}\\;{\\rm{at}}\\;{\\rm{time}}\\;{\\rm{point}}\\;0} \\right)]/{\\rm{slope}}\\;{\\rm{of}}\\;{\\rm{the}}\\;4{\\rm{MU}}\\;{\\rm{standard}}\\;{\\rm{curve}} \\end{eqnarray*}\nOGA activity is normalized by subtracting the fluorescence signal resulting from lysosomal hexosaminidase contamination, which was assessed using 4MU-GalNAc.\nOGA activity is expressed in moles of GlcNAc released per milligram of purified OGA or cell extract per minute of total reaction time."
