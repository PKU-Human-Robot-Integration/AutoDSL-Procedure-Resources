    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCollection and freezing of larvae for metabolite extraction\nTiming: 1 day\nUsing forceps, collect 20 larvae at the stage of interest in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, either from the walls of the vial or, in the case of non-pupating larvae (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]), from the fly food. Alternatively, fill the vial with 50% glycerol diluted in 1× PBS: larvae will come up to the surface.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1454-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Larvae with knockdown of candidate factors controlling maturation commitment failed to wander out of the food\nInsets are magnifications of control larvae and larvae with RNAi of a hit gene.\nNote: We use 20 larvae here, but this protocol can also be applied to 10 adult flies.\nWeigh the animals with a precision scale.\nFreeze on dry ice.\nPause point: Store larvae at −80°C.\nMetabolite extraction\nTiming: 1 day\nAllow twenty frozen larvae (−80°C) to thaw for 5 min on ice (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Add a quality control (QC) sample consisting of a mixture of 5 representative metabolites, including the most unstable ones, for example ATP+ADP+histidine+methionine-sulfoxide+citrate. Perform exactly the same steps with the QC sample as with the larvae samples.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1454-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Metabolite extraction and NMR sample preparation\nCritical: Samples and solvents have to be kept ≤ 4°C during the whole procedure to avoid metabolite degradation.\nAdd 240 μL of methanol, 48 μL of deionized water, and 200 μL of chloroform on ice.\nCritical: The solvents must be added to the larvae sequentially. The solvents cannot be mixed together in advance because, owing to the different polarities of the solvents, the mixture may not be uniform and different amounts of solvent could be added to different samples.",
    "Note: No need to vortex samples after adding the solvents as the solvents will be mixed during the homogenization process with the pestle.\nAfter 10 min, homogenize samples with a small teflon pestle for 2 min and resuspend with a pipette, on ice.\nFor uniform cell breakage, place the samples in liquid nitrogen for 1 min and then allow to thaw on ice for 2 min. Repeat this step two more times.\nCritical: Handle liquid nitrogen with care. Wear gloves and protective goggles.\nAdd 120 μL of deionized water and 120 μL of chloroform to each sample on ice and vortex for 5 s.\nCentrifuge the samples at 10,000 g for 15 min at 4°C to allow phase separation into an aqueous (top) and an organic (bottom) phase, containing polar and non-polar compounds, respectively. The middle layer, containing mainly proteins and cell membranes, can be discarded, or stored at −80°C for quantification of the total protein in each sample. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nTransfer each phase to a different 1.5 mL Eppendorf ® tubes on ice. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nFor lyophilization, make a hole with a needle in the caps of the tubes containing the aqueous phase, introduce the tubes into liquid nitrogen, and transfer them to the lyophilizer overnight to remove water and methanol.\nTo remove the solvents from the organic phase, tubes are placed in a fume hood and solvents evaporated under a gentle stream of nitrogen.\nPause point: Store extracts at −80°C.\nNMR sample preparation\nTiming: 5 min per sample\nPlace extract samples on ice and allow to thaw for 5 min.",
    "For aqueous extract: transfer 550 μL of NMR buffer (100 mM Na2HPO4, 0.1 mM TSP, pH 7.4, in 100% D2O) to each sample and mix with a pipette. Transfer the samples into 5-mm NMR tubes on ice (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1454-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. NMR spectrum acquisition\nOrganic extract: dissolve extracts in 600 μL of deuterated chloroform (CHCl3-d1) with 0.0027% tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. Vortex samples, transfer into 5-mm NMR tubes, and seal the tubes.\nPause point: Store samples up to 12 h at 4°C.\nNote: ATP in samples can be stable during 24 h at 4°C, but as a precaution to the possible presence of less stable metabolites, it may be safer to reduce this delay.\nCritical: Small air bubbles inside the NMR tubes affect the resolution of the NMR spectra. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\nNMR spectra acquisition\nTiming: 20–50 min per sample\nIntroduce the sample into the NMR spectrometer.\nSet the temperature to 27°C (aqueous phase) or 25°C (organic phase) and allow to stabilize for 5 min.\nAqueous extracts: record 1H 1D NOESY NMR spectra with 400 scans.\nCritical: To obtain good quality spectra, apply the following settings: 64k data points digitalized over a spectral width of 30 ppm for optimal baseline correction, a 4-s relaxation delay between FIDs and a water presaturation pulse of 25 Hz to minimize the water signal.\nOrganic extracts: record 1H 1D NOESY NMR spectra with 128 scans.\nCritical: To obtain good quality spectra apply the following settings: 64k data points digitalized over a spectral width of 30 ppm for optimal baseline correction and a 4-s relaxation delay between FIDs.",
    "Acquire 2D experiments for selected representative samples to confirm metabolite assignment. Perform total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) and multiplicity heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) of the aqueous phase and the organic phase. For each of these experiments, use 256–512 t1 increments and collect 32–96 transients. Set the relaxation delays to 1.5 s and acquire the experiments in the phase-sensitive mode. Record TOCSY spectra using a standard MLEV-17 pulse sequence with mixing times (spin-lock) of 65 ms.\nNMR spectra processing and integration\nTiming: 3 min per sample\nPerform Fourier transformation on each spectrum. Multiply the FID values by an exponential function with a 0.5-Hz line broadening factor.\nPerform automatic phase correction on each spectrum. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7].\nCritical: Adjust manually, if phase is not correct after automatic correction.\nReference the spectra of the aqueous extracts to the TSP peak (0.00 ppm) and the spectra of the organic phase to the TMS peak (0 ppm) using Mnova 12 or ChenomX.\nAssign signals to metabolite identities by comparison to reference values for chemical shift and multiplicity, and spectra of pure compounds in the human metabolome database (Wishart et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9].\nGenerate automatic integration regions in Mnova 12 or ChenomX, taking into account signal assignment.\nGenerate integration tables in Mnova 12 or ChenomX by applying automatic integration with the GSD deconvolution option.\nNormalize integration tables to total intensity.\nQuantitative RT-PCR of lipid- and carbohydrate-metabolism-related genes\nTiming: 3 days\nTo assess mRNA levels of lipid and carbohydrate-metabolism-related genes, extract the total mRNA from five Drosophila larvae using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Cat#74106).\nTo remove contaminating DNA, treat RNA with an RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen Cat#79254).\nSynthesize cDNA with the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR using random oligo-dT primers (Invitrogen Cat#18080-051).",
    "Perform quantitative real-time PCR using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems Cat#4367659) with gene-specific primers and an ABI 7500 system (Applied Biosystems). For primers used, see Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1454-Mmc1.extension].\nNormalize to ß-actin.\nNote: We perform comparative qPCRs in triplicate and calculate the relative expression with the comparative Ct method.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1454_4.csv\nHemolymph sample preparation\nTiming: 20 min per sample\nRinse 15 larvae (three replicates per sample) in PBS and dry on tissue paper.\nImmerse the larvae individually in Schneider’s Drosophila medium (ThermoFisher Scientific Cat# 21720024), a medium with L-glutamine and sodium bicarbonate suitable for insect cell culture. Carefully tear the cuticles to release the hemolymph.\nIn a 0.5 mL tube, puncture a cross using a #22 surgical blade and collect larvae in this tube.\nTo collect the hemolymph (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]), place the 0.5 mL tube (with a cross-shaped hole in the lower part) inside a 1.5 mL tube. Then, spin using a 5415 R centrifuge (Eppendorf) 3 times for 3 s each time at room temperature and with the caps open.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1454-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Collection of the hemolymph\nTransfer 10 μL of the supernatant to a new 1.5 mL tube.\nCritical: To prevent melanization, the handling time should be as short as possible and proceed in cold conditions (i.e., keep on ice before and after larval cuticle breakage).\nGlucose, trehalose, triglyceride, and cholesterol measurements\nTiming: 2 days",
    "Lipids are a heterogeneous group of organic compounds that are insoluble in water, and are used as cell membrane components, energy storage molecules, and hormones. Cholesterol is a precursor of steroid hormones and an essential structural component of animal cell membranes. To determine cholesterol levels, use an Amplex Red Cholesterol Assay Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific Cat#A12216, https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Fmp12216.pdf[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Fmp12216.pdf]). To analyze triglycerides (TAG), the primarily nutrient store in the fat body, use a Serum Triglyceride Determination Kit (Sigma-Aldrich Cat#TR0100-1KT, https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/deepweb/assets/sigmaaldrich/product/documents/320/307/tr0100bul.pdf[href=https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/deepweb/assets/sigmaaldrich/product/documents/320/307/tr0100bul.pdf]). Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.11].\nStored (glycogen) and circulating (glucose and trehalose) carbohydrates are essential energy sources present in the larval hemolymph that, on cellular uptake, satisfy many of the energy needs of cells. To determine glucose levels, use a GAHK20 Glucose Assay Kit (Sigma-Aldrich Cat#GAHK20-1KT) for dissected tissues or whole larvae, according to the manufacturer's instructions (https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/deepweb/assets/sigmaaldrich/product/documents/211/614/gahk20bul.pdf[href=https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/deepweb/assets/sigmaaldrich/product/documents/211/614/gahk20bul.pdf]). To determine trehalose levels, convert to glucose with porcine trehalase (Sigma-Aldrich Cat# T8778) incubating all standards and samples at 37°C for 18–24 h and measure using the same kit described above. To determine glycogen levels, use amyloglucosidase (Sigma-Aldrich Cat# A1602) to break down glycogen into molecules of free glucose, which is then quantified using the GAHK20 assay.\nCritical: The amount of triglycerides in larval tissues is very high; depending on the larval stage being analyzed, we use different numbers of individuals per sample (20 animals for second-instar larvae, 6 for early third-instar larvae, 4 for mid third-instar larvae, and 2 for late third-instar larvae). For glucose measurements and determination of cholesterol in hemolymph we use 15 animals per sample.\nDissection, immunostaining, mounting, and super-resolution imaging of larval tissues\nTiming: 2 days\nUsing forceps, collect 10–20 larvae at the stage of interest, either from the walls of the vial or, in the case of non-pupating larvae, from the fly food.",
    "Place larvae in a petri dish layered with Sylgard 184 transparent resin (Dow Corning Cat# 000000818156) containing drops of cold 1× PBS (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1454-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

Scale bars, 1 mm in (B) and (C).\nRemove the brain lobes (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B and Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]), fat bodies (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C and Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]), or imaginal discs by holding the larval body with one pair of forceps and pulling from the larval mouth hook with a second pair. Discard the larval body and remove excess unwanted tissue with fine mounted pins.\nPlace clean fly tissues (brain lobes with intact prothoracic endocrine glands or imaginal discs or fat bodies) in a glass well containing 150 μL of cold 1× PBS. Fix the larval tissues by adding 50 μL of 16% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences Cat#15710) for a final concentration of 4% paraformaldehyde. Incubate in the dark on an orbital shaker with gentle agitation for 20 min at room temperature.\nCritical: Paraformaldehyde is an irritant. Avoid inhalation and wear gloves when handling this reagent. After use, proper disposal according to appropriate guidelines is mandatory.\nWash the fixed tissues three times with 1× PBS.\nNote: Add 200 μL of blocking solution (5% normal goat serum) and incubate the fixed tissues in the dark on an orbital shaker with gentle agitation for at least 30 min at room temperature. For the majority of commercial antibodies, it is possible to omit the blocking step and incubate the dissected tissues directly in primary antibodies overnight (10–12 h).",
    "To label relevant architectural features, dilute primary antibodies (mouse anti-Dlg 4F3 (1/100, DSHB) or rat anti-DE-Cad DCAD2 (1/50, DSHB)) in 0.3% Triton in 1× PBS in 1.5 mL tubes (you will need 200 μL per well).\nIncubate larval tissues with primary antibodies in the dark, overnight (10–12 h) at room temperature.\nNote: If the ambient temperature is very high, use a humidified chamber to avoid evaporation, adding moist papers to the chamber. For longer periods incubate at 4°C.\nWash the samples three times with PBS.\nDilute secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 555 (1/500) or 647 (1/200) for anti-Dlg 4F3 and Alexa Fluor 647 (1/200) for anti- DE-Cad) in 0.3% Triton in 1× PBS in 1.5 mL tubes (you will need 200 μL per well).\nIncubate with secondary antibodies in the dark for 3 h at room temperature.\nWash the samples three times with PBS.\nNote: To label neutral lipids, after incubation with the corresponding secondary antibodies, rinse larval tissues three times with PBS and then incubate for 40 min with a 1:500 dilution of PBS with 1 mg/ml Nile Red (Sigma-Aldrich Cat#72485) at room temperature. Troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.13].\nMounting: Add 4 μL of Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (H-1200, Vector Labs) and use the bridge method (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D) to mount larval tissues and preserve their three dimensional configuration.\nUse a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope with Airyscan for super-resolution imaging of larval brains, fat bodies, and prothoracic gland cells. Airyscan is a module for super-resolution imaging that uses an array detector with laser scanning confocal microscopy.\nUse ImageJ software to measure total fluorescence intensity or lipid droplet size in larval tissues.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nVideo S1.
