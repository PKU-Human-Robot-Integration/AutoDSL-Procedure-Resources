    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nStep one: Liver perfusion\nTiming: 21–25 min\nHigh quality liver perfusion is critical to wash out red blood cells and completely digest the liver so that it is ready for the dissociation into individual cells.\nFill the bubble trap with pre-warmed EGTA Working Buffer before liver perfusion.\nEuthanize mouse using isoflurane in an animal holding jar.\nMove animal to a flat experimental table and perform laparotomy as soon as the mouse is dead.\nExpose Internal Vena Cava (IVC) of the mouse.\nCannulate IVC with 18-gauge catheter.\nNote: The site of IVC cannulation is above the renal veins and below the liver.\nStabilize the catheter after cannulation to ensure it does not move throughout the perfusion.\nUse absorbable tissues to remove extra fluid around the liver. See Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. IVC cannulation and initiation of EGTA buffer perfusion. Related to major step one, sub-steps 4 and 5\nUse all of the 35 mL of EGTA Working Buffer to perfuse liver and wash out RBCs. The total time of EGTA perfusion is 5–8 min depending on the mouse diet.\nNote: A well-perfused liver looks pale at the end of perfusion. See Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nWhen the liver starts to look engorged by the EGTA Working Buffer (usually 3–5 s), cut the hepatic vein.\nCarefully clamp the IVC above the diaphragm immediately after cutting hepatic vein.\nNote: Please make sure the catheter is in place without movement.\nAfter perfusing the EGTA Working Buffer, take the end of the tubing out and directly put it into the 50-mL centrifuge tube containing pre-warmed Pronase Working Buffer within 3 s. Perfuse the liver with the entire 35 mL Pronase Working Buffer.\nNote: Total perfusion time is 8–10 min.",
    "Place heat lamp over the liver during all enzyme perfusion steps including Pronase and Collagenase D Working Buffer perfusions.\nNote: Make sure the transition among different buffers is smooth and bubble trap remains filled. See Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2].\nAfter perfusing the Pronase Working Buffer, perfuse liver with the entire 40 mL of Collagenase D Working Buffer. Total perfusion time is 8–10 min.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2134-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Gross liver morphology after perfusion\nNote: In the end, the liver should be soft and well-digested. See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nRemove the liver and place it into a 60-mm cell culture dish for further liver dissociation.\nCritical: Sub-steps 4 and 5, see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].

Transition to Pronase working buffer perfusion. Related to major step one, sub-step 7\nStep two: Dissociation of livers cells\nTiming: 25 min\nThis step is to dissociate the digested liver to release all liver cell types. The homogenized mixture is a combination of all liver cells and debris. The goal is to have few clumps of liver tissue.\nAdd 5 to 10-mL of preheated Liver Dissociation Buffer into the 60-mm cell culture dish with the liver. Use tweezers to dissociate liver until the mixture becomes largely homogenous.\nNote: Total time is 5–8 min. See Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3].\nTransfer homogenized liver mixture to a clear Boston round bottle with black phenolic polycone cap.\nNote: Add the remaining 40 to 45-mL of pre-heated Liver Dissociation Buffer together with 600 μL DNase Stock Solution into the glass bottle. See Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4].\nFurther dissociate homogenized mixture in glass bottle above using gentle rotation by hand swirling in a 39°C water bath (see video) for 20 min.

Related to major step two, sub-steps 11 and 12\nStep three: Gradient centrifugation\nTiming: 90 min\nThis step is to wash homogenized liver tissue mixture to remove debris and undigested liver tissue.\nTransfer homogenized tissue mixture into a 50-mL centrifuge tube by filtering the mixture through a 70-μm cell strainer.\nCentrifuge the mixture at 580 g at 4°C for 10 min.\nRemove and discard the top 40 mL without disturbing the bottom pellet. 10 mL of the supernatant and cell pellet will remain in the centrifuge tube.\nAdd 150 μL DNase Stock Solution to the tissue mixture and using a 10 mL pipette and mix.\nAdd 40 mL GBSS buffer to the tissue mixture using a 10 mL pipette and mix.\nCentrifuge the mixture at 580 g at 4°C for 10 min and repeat steps 15 and 16.\nAdd 16-mL pre-made Nycondez Buffer to the mixture and use GBSS buffer to bring the total volume to 48 mL. Mix well using a 10 mL pipette.\nAliquot 12 mL into four 15-mL centrifuge tubes.\nCarefully add an additional 3-mL GBSS buffer using a 3-mL syringe with a 25-gauge needle to the top of the 12-mL aliquot so that a gradient can form.\nNote: Make sure not to disturb the gradient layer. See Methods video S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5].",
    "Centrifuge the 4 centrifuge tubes at 1,380 g at 4°C for 17 min. Acceleration of centrifuge is set at 9 while deceleration of centrifuge is set at 0. The total centrifugation time is ∼37 min.\nAfter centrifugation, the bottom pellet is a mixture of all cell types.

Related to major step three, sub-step 21\nStep four: Liver cells harvest before single cell RNA sequencing\nTiming: 20 min\nThis step is to obtain viable hepatocytes with other liver cell types.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant using a 2-mL plastic serological pipette and discard without disrupting the pellet. See Methods video S6[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc6].\nAdd 1 mL RBC Lysis Buffer (stored at 4°C) to each of the four 15 mL centrifuge tubes above.\nPlace tubes on ice for 5 min.\nAdd 13 mL pre-chilled PBS stored at 4°C to each 15-mL tube and mix well using a 10 mL pipette. Centrifuge at 400 g at 4°C for 4 min.\nRemove the supernatant and re-suspend pellet in 1 mL pre-chilled PBS stored at 4°C and transfer the mixture to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube using 1 mL pipette set at 500 μL.\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 100 g for 3 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant, and wash pellet using 1 mL chilled PBS and repeat centrifugation to harvest hepatocytes.\nAlternatives: Centrifuge cell suspension at 400 g for 4 min at 4°C to harvest both hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells.\nResuspend hepatocytes using 500–1,000 μL chilled PBS at 4°C for cell counting and determination of cellular viability by trypan blue staining.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2134-Fig4.jpg",
