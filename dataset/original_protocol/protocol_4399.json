    "DNA and total RNA were extracted with respectively DNeasy Plant mini kit and RNeasy mini kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.    Each RNA sample was DNase treated (Recombinant DNase I) and quantified with a Nanodrop.   cDNAs were generated by M-MLV reverse transcriptase using oligo (dT) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.   The cDNA produced was diluted with four parts of sterile deionized water.   PCR amplification of the target (containing the putative editing region) was performed using KOD high fidelity polymerase and target specific oligonucleotide primers (it’s better to design primers that spans introns to prevent the amplification of residual contaminant genomic DNA).    PCR product was purified using a Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery Kit and cloned into a pJET vector using pJET cloning kit.   Direct sequencing was performed on plasmid containing the target cloned in pJET vector. For each sample, 2 independent RT-PCR reactions were performed."
