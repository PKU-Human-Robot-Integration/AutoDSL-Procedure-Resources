    "1. Library construction\nUse a synthetic combinatorial single-domain antibody library with a diversity of ~1.23–7.14 x 109, as previously described19. While this protocol does not include library construction, it can be applied to other combinatorial binder libraries.\n2. Biotinylation of ligand target or ligand\nBiotinylate the selected ligand, for example, CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)19, via various chemical synthesis strategies, depending on the suitable biotinylation sites of a target.\n3. Anchor binder screening\nBeginning of selection\n\t\nBegin every round of selection by inoculating a single TG1-cell colony, freshly grown in 6 mL of 2YT at 37 ˚C and 250 revolutions per minute (rpm) to a 600 nm (OD600) absorbance of ~0.5. Incubate the cells on ice for the use in step 3.5.1.\nNegative selection with biotin-bound streptavidin beads\n\t\nPrepare the \"negative selection beads\" by washing 300 µL of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads using a magnetic separation rack, 3x with 0.05% phosphate-buffered saline with Tween buffer (PBST, 1 x PBS with 0.05% vol/vol Tween 20%) and 2x with 1 x PBS.\nResuspend the beads with 1 mL of 1% casein in 1 x PBS (pH = 7.4), and saturate the beads by adding 5x the reported binding capacity using biotin. Incubate at room temperature (RT) on a rotator for 1 h.\nWash the beads 5x using 0.05% PBST and 3x using 1 x PBS, for a total of eight washes.\nAdd ~1013 phage particles in 1% casein/1% BSA in 1 x PBS (pH = 7.4) and incubate at RT on a rotator for 1 h.\nAfter incubation, collect the supernatant to be used in step 3.3.6.\nPositive selection with biotinylated ligand-bound streptavidin beads\n\t\nPrepare the \"positive selection beads\" using 1/2 the volume of the beads used for the \"negative selection beads\" following steps 3.2.1.",
    "Re-suspend the beads with 1 mL 1% casein in 1 × PBS, pH 7.4 and saturate the beads by adding 5x the full binding capacity calculated based on the manual using the biotinylated ligand of choice. Incubate at RT on a rotator for 1 h.\nWash the beads 5x using 0.05% PBST and 3x using 1 x PBS, for a total of eight washes.\nBlock the beads with 1 mL of 1% casein/1% BSA in 1 x PBS (pH = 7.4) and incubate at RT on a rotator for 1 h to prevent nonspecific binding between the phages and the streptavidin-coated magnetic beads.\nWash the streptavidin-coated magnetic beads 3x using 0.05% PBST and one time using 1 x PBS, for a total of four washes.\nResuspend the streptavidin-coated magnetic beads using the unbound phages taken from step 3.2.5 and incubate at RT on a rotator for 1 h.\nExtract the supernatant without disturbing the magnetic beads. Save the unbound phages as input, to be used in step 3.5.1.\nWash the beads 10x using 0.05% PBST and 5x using 1 x PBS. In between every three washes transfer them to a new tube to avoid phages nonspecifically bound to the tube walls.\nElution of phage-displayed nanobodies\n\t\nCompetitively elute bound phages by adding 450 µL of the non-biotinylated ligand, using a concentration in the micromolar range (e.g., 10–50 µM) and incubating at RT on a rotator for 30 min. The selected ligand concentration for the competitive elution of bound phages is dependent on desired KD of the \"anchor binder\". Ligand concentrations can be relatively high in initial selection rounds and then decreased in later rounds.\nCollect supernatant and save the eluted phages as output, to be used in step 3.5.2.\nInput/output titrations and infection",
    "For input titration, prepare 10x serial dilutions in 1 x PBS up to 109-fold with the input phage from step 3.3.7. Use the 107–109 serial dilutions to do infections by transferring 10 µL input phage from each dilution to 70 µL TG1 cells (OD600 of ~0.5). Incubate at 37 ˚C for 45 min, plate the infected TG1 cells on three 90 mm 2YT-agar dishes containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 2% (wt/vol) glucose, and incubate overnight at 37 ˚C. From the overnight plates, phage input can be calculated as follows:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60738/60738eq1.jpg\nFor output infection and titration, transfer the eluted phages from step 3.4.2 to 3 mL of TG1 cells (OD600 of ~0.5). Incubate in a water bath at 37 ˚C for 45 min. Then prepare 10x serial dilutions in 2YT up to 103-fold, plate each dilution on 90 mm 2YT-agar dishes, and incubate overnight at 37 ˚C. From the overnight plates, phage output can be calculated as follows:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60738/60738eq1.jpg\nDivide the remaining infected TG1 cells on three 150 mm 2YT-agar plates containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 2% (wt/vol) glucose. Incubate plates overnight at 37 ˚C.\nLibrary amplification and recovery for further rounds of selection\n\t\nAdd 3 mL of 2YT per plate, scrape with a sterile cell scraper and collect all cells in a 50 mL conical tube. Mix the collected cells with sterile glycerol (20% wt/vol final concentration). Measure the OD600 of the mixture and make 3–5 stock aliquots. Store at -80 ˚C for long-term storage.\nFor phage rescue, dilute the phagemid-containing TG1 bacterial mixture using 25 mL of 2YT media supplemented with 2% glucose and 100 μg/mL ampicillin to an OD600 of ~0.1. Culture cells at 37 ˚C and 250 rpm to an OD600 of ~0.5.",
    "Superinfect the cells by adding CM13 helper phage at 5 x 109 pfu/mL and incubate at 37 ˚C and 250 rpm for 45 min. The CM13 helper phage provides required phage coat proteins for the assembly of complete phage particles.\nCentrifuge the culture at 8,000 x g for 10 min to remove the glucose. Resuspend the cells using 50 mL of 2YT media supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 50 μg/mL kanamycin and incubate at 25 ˚C and 250 rpm overnight.\nCentrifuge the cells from the overnight culture at 9,000 x g, 4 ˚C for 30 min. Transfer supernatant to a new tube and precipitate phages in the supernatant using 1/5 volume PEG/NaCl solution (20% wt/vol polyethylene glycol-6,000 and 2.5 M NaCl). Mix gently and place on ice for 1 h.\nCollect phage particles by centrifugation using 12,000 x g at 4 ˚C for 30 min. Resuspend the pellets using 1 mL of 1 x PBS, and transfer the suspension to a microcentrifuge tube. Centrifuge the tube at 20,000 x g and 4 ˚C for 10 min to remove residual bacteria.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new microcentrifuge tube without disturbing the bacterial pellet. Use a 1:100 dilution to measure the absorption at 269 nm and 320 nm. The total number of phages can be calculated using the following formula23:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60738/60738eq3.jpg\nStore phage library at 4 ˚C for short-term use or with 25% glycerol at -80 ˚C for long-term storage.\nRepeat rounds of selection (steps 3.1–3.6) for 3–6 rounds or until desired enrichment is observed (refer to Results section). Plate and pick single clones (section 4) in order to characterize their affinity and specificity to the ligand (sections 5–7).\n4. Single clone isolation",
    "To isolate individual clones from an enriched sublibrary, prepare 10x serial dilutions of the phage-infected TG1 cells (step 3.5.2). Plate serial dilutions on 90 mm 2YT-agar dishes containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 2% (wt/vol) glucose and incubate at 37 ˚C overnight.\nFrom the overnight plates, pick single colonies into 250 μL of 2YT media supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin per well in sterile deep-well plates and grow at 37 ˚C overnight.\nFrom the overnight cultures, inoculate 10 µL into 500 µL of fresh 2YT media supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin.\nGrow cells to an OD600 of ~0.5, add CM13 helper phage at 5 x 109 pfu/mL and incubate at 37 ˚C and 250 rpm for 45 min.\nAdd 500 µL of 2YT media supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 50 μg/mL kanamycin. Incubate at 25 ˚C and 250 rpm overnight.\nCentrifuge the deep-well plates from the overnight cultures at 3,000 x g for 10 min. Collect the supernatant containing the phage particles without disturbing the cell pellet.\nPhage particles can be used for ELISA to determine the specificity of the selected clones to the ligand. Biotin or a structural homolog of the target can be used as a negative control.\n5. Anchor binder validation by ELISA\nCoat 96 well ELISA plates using 100 μL of 5 μg/mL streptavidin in coating buffer (100 mM carbonate buffer, pH = 8.6) at 4 ˚C overnight.\nWash the ELISA plates 3x using 0.05% PBST and add 100 μL of 1 μM biotinylated target to the target wells. Add 100 μL of 1 μM biotin or target homolog to the control wells. Incubate at RT for 1 h.\nWash plates 5x using 0.05% PBST and block nonspecific binding by adding 300 µL of 1% casein in 1 x PBS. Incubate at RT for 1 h.",
    "Wash the ELISA plates 3x using 0.05%-PBST and add the purified phage supernatant. Incubate for 1 h at RT.\nWash the ELISA plates 10x using 0.05% PBST and add 100 μL horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-M13 major coat protein antibody (1:10,000 dilution with 1 x PBS with 1% casein). Incubate at RT for 1 h.\nWash the ELISA plates 3x using 0.05% PBST and add 100 μL tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate. Incubate for 10 min or until a visible color change is observed. Stop the reaction by adding 100 μL of 1 M HCl. Read the plate at 450 nm on a spectrophotometer.\nFor protein expression and purification, choose the clones showing high affinity and specificity for the target (see Discussion).\n6. Protein expression, purification, and biotinylation\nAs previously reported19, subclone selected clones from section 5 and express as C-terminal Avi-tagged and His-tagged nanobodies.\nExpress selected nanobodies in the periplasm of E. coli WK6 cells (typically in 1 L culture), release by osmotic shock, and purify using a nickel-NTA column (see Table of Materials).\nExchange buffer with a desalting column (1 x PBS with 5% glycerol; see Table of Materials).\nBiotinylate nanobodies using a commercial kit (see Table of Materials) for further use.\n7. Anchor binder characterization by BLI\nAnalyze the binding affinity and kinetics of selected anchor binders by immobilizing 200 nM biotinylated anchor binders on streptavidin biosensors (see Table of Materials) with binding assay buffer (1 x PBS (pH = 7.4), 0.05% Tween 20, 0.2% BSA, 3% methanol).\nCalculate dissociation constants (KD) of anchor binder-ligand interactions by steady-state analysis using data analysis software (see Table of Materials). Obtained KD values typically range from single- to double-digit micromolar.\n8. Dimerization binder screening",
    "NOTE: The biopanning screening of \"dimerization binders\" is similar to that of anchor binders, except for two critical steps: 1) Dimerization binders are selected using a selected biotinylated anchor binder and the anchor binder-ligand complex for the negative and positive selections, respectively. 2) During the elution step, 100 mM triethylamine is used to elute positively selected phages that were only bound to the anchor binder--ligand target complex. The 100 mM trimethylamine solution (pH = 11.5) is used to elute positive clones by disrupting the protein interactions.\nBeginning of selection\n\t\nBegin every round of selection by inoculating a single TG1 cell colony, freshly grown on a minimal media, in 6 mL 2YT at 37 ˚C and 250 rpm to an OD600 of ~0.5. Incubate cells on ice.\nRemoval of negatively selected nanobodies\n\t\nPrepare the \"subtraction tube\" by using 400 µL of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads and follow step 3.2. However, instead of saturating with biotin, add 5x the calculated full binding capacity using the selected biotinylated anchor binder and save the unbound phages to be used in step 8.3.3.\nSelection of positively selected nanobodies\n\t\nPrepare the \"capturing tube\" by using 1/2 the volume of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads used for the \"subtraction tube\" and following steps 3.3.2 to 3.3.3. However, instead of saturating with the biotinylated ligand, add five times the calculated full binding capacity using the selected biotinylated anchor binder.\nTo form the anchor binder-ligand complex for the positive dimerization binder selection, add a high enough concentration of non-biotinylated ligand. This will allow most streptavidin-bound anchor binder to form the ligand-bound complex.\nFollow steps 3.3.3 to 3.3.8, using the unbound phages taken from the \"subtraction tube\".\nElution of positively selected nanobodies",
    "Elute the phages bound to the anchor binder-ligand complex by adding 450 µL of 100 mM triethylamine, and incubating at RT on a rotator for 10 min.\nCollect the competitively eluted phages and follow steps 3.4.1 to 3.4.2.\nFurther rounds of dimerization binder selection\n\t\nFollow steps 3.5 and 3.6 to amplify and recover the library in order to perform further rounds of selection. Repeat rounds of selection for 3–6 rounds or until desired enrichment is observed. Plate and pick single clones (refer to section 4) in order to characterize their affinity and specificity to the target.\n9. Dimerization binder characterization by ELISA\nFollow the steps in section 4 to isolate individual clones for characterization via ELISA.\nTo test the affinity of dimerization binder candidates to the anchor binder-ligand complex, coat the ELISA target plate using 100 μL of 100 nM biotinylated anchor binder. After incubation for 1 h, add 1 μM of the ligand target to form the anchor binder-ligand complex.\nThe control plate should be coated using the biotinylated anchor binder alone to screen out clones that can also bind to the free anchor binder. Add 100 μL of 100 nM biotinylated anchor binder and incubate at RT for 1 h.\nFollow sections 5.3–5.7.\n10. Dimerization binder characterization by BLI\nThe binding affinity and kinetics of dimerization binders for the anchor binder--ligand complex can be analyzed by immobilizing biotinylated dimerization binders on streptavidin (SA) biosensors with the binding assay buffer and then assayed with 1 μM anchor binder pre-equilibrated with serial dilutions of the ligand. The KD, kon, and koff of the interactions can be calculated using our reported method19.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
