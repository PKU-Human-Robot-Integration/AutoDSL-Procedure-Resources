    "NOTE: All procedures were performed in compliance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care & Use Committee of Drexel University College of Medicine. Timed-pregnant CD-1 mice were used for astrocytic culture, and all dams were received 15 days after impregnation. Ten-twelve weeks old C57BL/6 mice were used for in vivo uptake experiments.\n1.
