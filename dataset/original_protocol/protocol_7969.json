    "NOTE: The protocol was adapted from Ref. 24.\n1. Obtain RNA and Enzyme of Interest\nUse in vitro transcribed RNAs internally labeled with 32P, and recombinant His6-Mod5 expressed in and purified from E. coli, as previously described24.\n\t\nIntroduce in vitro transcribed RNAs (section 3) using T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of unlabeled ATP, UTP, CTP, GTP and 10 µCi of gel-purified, ethanol-precipitated α-ATP, resuspended in 1x TE (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA), and stored at -80 °C24.\nAlternatively, obtain commercially available fluorescently labeled RNAs of interest. Produce the enzyme(s) of interest in any preferred expression system.\n\tCaution: Internal fluorescent tags in the RNA can alter RNA structure and recognition by enzymes.\n2. Prepare a 20% Polyacrylamide Denaturing Gel\nNote: In order to obtain sufficient resolution of RNA fragments, a 40 cm length vertical slab gel is recommended. The width of the gel used is determined by the number of samples to be analyzed.\nThoroughly clean glass plates. First, wash with soap and water, rinse well with deionized water, and finally clean with isopropanol and lint-free wipes.\nAssemble the plates and spacers.\nMix the following reagents to make 100 mL of 20% acrylamide, 7.5 M urea, 1x TBE gel: 80 mL of urea gel concentrate (237.5 g/L of acrylamide, 12.5 g/L of methylene bisacrylamide, 7.5 M urea in deionized water), 10 mL of urea gel diluent (7.5M urea in deionized water), and 10 mL of urea gel buffer (0.89 M Tris-Borate-20 mM EDTA buffer pH 8.3 and 7.5 M urea).\n\tNOTE: The volume of gel solution must be adjusted according to the dimensions of gel.\nAdd 40 µL of N,N,N′,N′-Tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) and 800 µL of freshly prepared 10% ammonium persulfate (APS).",
    "Draw gel solution up into a large syringe and dispense between glass plates. Tap on glass with fingers while pouring to prevent bubble formation.\nAllow gel to solidify for 30 min.\nClamp solidified gel onto vertical gel apparatus using binder clips.\nFill upper and lower buffer chambers with 1x TBE.\nTwo hours prior to loading the gel, pre-run the gel at 20 mA, for 2 h to allow the buffer boundary to outrun the smallest oligonucleotides - otherwise the smallest nucleotides and oligonucleotides tend to collapse at the buffer front.\n3. RNA Isopentenylation Assay\nPrepare reactions in a final volume of 17 µL, containing 58 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 1.2 mM ATP, 5.8 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM DMAPP, 10 U of RNase inhibitor (e.g., SuperRNaseIn), 40,000 CPM of internally 32P-labeled RNA, 5.3 µM Mod5, and 1.2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol.\nIncubate reactions at 37 °C for 1 h.\nEthanol-precipitate RNAs using 2.5 volumes (42.5 µL) of 100% ethanol and 1/10 volumes (1.7 µL) of 3.5 M sodium acetate pH 5.5, and place at -20 °C for 1 h or overnight.\nCentrifuge RNA samples for 20 min at 15,400 x g and 4 °C.\nCarefully remove the supernatant and wash the RNA pellet with 500 µL of 70% ethanol.\nCentrifuge samples at for 5 min 15,400 x g and 4°C.\nCarefully remove the supernatant and air-dry RNA pellets for 15 min, or until all ethanol has evaporated.\nResuspend RNA pellets in 10 µL of 8 M urea.\nAdd 150 U of RNase T1 and incubate at 37 °C overnight.\nAdd 2 µL of 6x loading buffer (60% glycerol, 0.1% xylene cyanol).\nLoad 10 µL of each RNA sample on a pre-run, 20% polyacrylamide, 7.5 M urea gel (see section 2 of Protocol).",
    "NOTE: Radiolabeled RNA size ladders may be included as an additional mobility marker.\nRun gel for 2 h at 25 mA.\nStop gel and remove from apparatus.\nBreak seal between the two glass plates and remove one of the glass plates, with the gel remaining on the \"bottom\" plate.\n\tNOTE: Take care not to tear the gel during this step.\nPlace a layer of plastic wrap over the gel and expose on a phosphor screen for 3 h. Alternatively, place gel on chromatography paper and dry with a gel dryer prior to phosphor screen exposure.\nImage phosphor screen on a phosphor imager.\nSubscription Required.
