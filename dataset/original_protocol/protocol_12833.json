    "1. Restriction Enzyme Treatment\nLinearize mtDNA by treating total human DNA with the restriction enzyme BamHI, that cuts at position 14258 in the human mitochondrial DNA.\n\tNOTE: For mouse DNA, use the restriction enzyme BglII under identical conditions as below.\nFor each sample where mtDNA methylation is to be assessed, prepare one 0.2 mL reaction tube and add the following mix:3 μg genomic DNA (quantified by fluorometry), 15 μL Buffer 3, 3 μL BamHI and water up to of 150 μL\nPlace tubes in a thermal cycler for 4 h at 37 °C.\n2. Bisulfite Conversion\nConvert BamHI-treated DNA using sodium bisulfite as described elsewhere29.\nUse 200-500 ng BamHI-treated DNA for each conversion reaction in a total volume of 20 μL. The DNA recovery is 50-70%.\nElute the Bisulfite-converted DNA in 10 μL elution buffer.\nQuantify the single-stranded DNA by fluorometry.\nOptional: Store bisulfite-converted DNA at -20 °C before proceeding the remaining of the protocol. For long-term storage, store bisulfite-converted DNA at -80 °C\n3. Design of Bisulfite Sequencing Primers\nDesign primers for bisulfite sequencing using the online tools Methprimer30 and BiSearch31,32.\n\tNOTE: Methprimer and BiSearch allow to search for primer binding sequences on genomic sequences where cytosines are converted to thymines, similarly to post-bisulfite treatment.\nFor optimal and unbiased amplification, avoid CpG dinucleotides in the primers and design the amplicon size between 100-300 bp.\nEnsure that designed primers are specific to the mitochondrial DNA using BiSearch's function Primer Search. Insert the already designed bisulfite converted primers, tick the bisulfite box and include a reference genome and PCR parameters.\n\tNOTE: A list of possible PCR products will be displayed.\nCopy the top 1-5 primer sequences and paste them into an ordering form for oligonucleotide synthesis.",
    "NOTE: A list of human and mouse mtDNA primer sequences that has been validated in the lab is displayed in Table 1.\nTest primers using bisulfite converted PCR following agarose gel electrophoresis as described in step 4. Test and optimize all primer pairs separately and ensure the correct amplicon size appears on the agarose gel.\n\tNOTE: If multiplexing primers are needed, add multiple primers to one single PCR reaction and visualize the PCR products on agarose gel electrophoresis or, a more resolutive method such as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, to distinguish products of similar size.\n4. Bisulfite Converted PCR and Gel Extraction\nTo amplify the regions of interest, perform PCR using a hot start Taq polymerase. Briefly, mix 100 ng converted DNA, 500 µM sense and anti-sense primers, 1 µL dNTP mix (10 µM of each dNTP), and polymerase at 7.5 U/reaction in a total volume of 50 µL. Run PCR with the following conditions: 5 min at 95 °C (60 s 94 °C; 60 s 55 °C*; 60 s 72 °C) imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57772/57772eq2.jpg 35 cycles; 10 min 72 °C. Use primers either separately or multiplexed.\nOptional: When multiplexing primers, use 200 ng converted DNA and the following cycling conditions: 5 min 95 °C (60 s 94 °C; 90 s 55 °C*; 90 s 72 °C) imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57772/57772eq2.jpg 35 cycles; 10 min 72 °C.\n\tNOTE: Temperature may vary depending on the melting temperature of primers.\nSubject PCR products to gel electrophoresis on 2% agarose at 100 volts.\nUnder gentle UV light, extract PCR products with a scalpel and add to microtubes. Do not expose PCR products to excessive UV light to avoid DNA damage. Avoid exposure time over 30 s.\nPurify the PCR products using gel purification as described previously3.",
    "Quantify the purified DNA from step 4.5 using fluorometry. Proceed to step 5 or store samples at -20°C.\n5. Bisulfite Sequencing Library Preparation\nPerform library preparation of bisulfite-converted PCR products.\n\tOptional: multiplex PCR products at this stage.\nPerform end-repair using up to 100 ng of PCR product. Add 3 µL End prep enzyme and 6.5 µL End repair reaction buffer (10x) to 55.5 µL PCR product in a 0.2 mL tube. Place and incubate tube in a thermal cycler for 30 min at 20 °C followed by 30 min at 65 °C.\nLigate sequencing adaptors by mixing the end-repaired DNA with 15 µL Blunt/TA ligase mix, 2.5 µL Adaptor and 1 µL Ligation enhancer. If using <100 ng PCR product as input, dilute adaptor 10 times.\nPlace the mix (step 5.3) in a thermal cycler and incubate 15 min at 20 °C. Pause the thermal cycler and add 3 µl USER Enzyme to the tube. Mix and place the tube back in the Thermal cycler and incubate 15 min at 37 °C.\nSize select the adaptor-ligated DNA by using Solid Phase Reversible Immobilization (SPRI) beads with varying ratios of beads to DNA depending on PCR product size.\nAdd 13.5 µL H2O to adaptor-ligated DNA from step 5.4 and 55 µL resuspended SPRI beads. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min and place tube on a magnetic stand. When the solution is clear, transfer the supernatant to a new tube and discard tube containing the beads.\n\tNOTE: The supernatant contains the adaptor-ligated DNA and large unwanted fragments are bound to the discarded beads.\nAdd 25 µL resuspended SPRI beads to the supernatant from step 5.6, mix and incubate for 5 min at room temperature. Place the tube on the magnetic stand and discard the supernatant when the solution is clear.",
    "NOTE: The discarded supernatant contains unwanted DNA, whereas the adaptor-ligated DNA is bound to beads.\nWhile the tube is on the magnetic stand, add 200 µL 80% ethanol (freshly prepared) to wash the beads. Incubate 30 s and remove and discard the supernatant. Repeat this step for a total of 2 washes.\nAir dry beads for 5 min while the tube is on magnetic stand with an open lid.\nRemove the tube from the magnet, elute the DNA in 23 µL elution buffer and mix. Incubate at room temperature for 2 min.\nPlace the tube on a magnetic stand and when the solution is clear, transfer 2 µL to a 96-well PCR plate for the pre-PCR amplification (step 5.14).\nTransfer the rest approximately 21 µL to a new 0.2 mL tube for PCR amplification (step 5.17).\n\tNOTE: Be sure NOT to transfer any beads as beads can inhibit enzymatic reactions of next steps.\nProceed to step 5.14 or store samples at -20°C.\nPerform pre-PCR amplification by RT-qPCR to estimate the number of cycles needed to amplify the adaptor-ligated DNA. Per reaction, add the following in the 96-well PCR plate containing 2 µL DNA (step 5.11): 0.4 µL Index primer, 0.4 µL universal PCR primer, 7.2 µL H2O, 10 µL RT-qPCR master mix.\nPlace the plate in a real-time PCR machine and subject the plate to the following conditions: 30 s at 98 °C (10 s 98 °C; 75 s 65 °C) imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57772/57772eq2.jpg 20 cycles; 5 min 65 °C.\nEstimate the number of amplification cycles needed for each sample by subtracting one Ct-value to the Ct-value of the pre-amplification RT-qPCR corresponding to the end of the linear phase of the PCR reaction.",
    "Amplify the adaptor-ligated DNA from step 5.12 by mixing: 21 µL DNA, 25 µL PCR master mix, 1 µL Index primer, 1 µL Universal PCR primer and 2 µL H2O. In a thermal cycler, subject each sample to the following conditions: 30 s at 98 °C (10 s 98 °C; 75 s 65 °C) imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57772/57772eq2.jpg [calculated Ct from step 5.16] cycles; 5 min 65 °C.\n\tNOTE: Remember to only use one Index primer per sample to allow for multiplexing. The index is inserted during the PCR.\nPurify the amplified DNA SPRI beads and elute in 22 µL elution buffer.\nControl library quality by gel electrophoresis or alternative method. Look for correct library peak sizes (PCR product(s) size plus adaptor).\nEstimate the average base-pair size of the library product(s) by smear analysis: In advanced global settings, double-click on \"Table\" under smear analysis. Define the region from 100-1000 bp and click OK. Under Region Table, the defined region appears and library average size (bp) is calculated.\nQuantify libraries by fluorometry. Proceed to step 6 or store libraries at -20 °C.\n6. Next Generation Sequencing\nCalculate the nM concentration of libraries using the formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57772/57772eq1.jpg\nDilute libraries to the same nM concentration e.g. 2 nM (choose 4 nM, 2 nM, 1 nM, or 0.5 nM depending on library concentrations). Pool all libraries to achieve a pool of 2 nM libraries.\nDenature and dilute libraries following the sequencing instrument guide. In short: Denature the 2 nM pool by adding 0.2 N NaOH and incubate at room temperature for 5 min. Dilute the denatured pool to a final dilution of 10 pM. Denature and dilute a commercially available Control library to a final dilution of 12.5 pM. To a new tube, mix the 10 pM pool with 20% 12.5 pM Control library.",
    "NOTE: Bisulfite conversion introduces very low complexity. 20% Control library spike-in will result in better sequencing quality.\nRun a 150 bp paired-end sequencing using a deep sequencing instrument.\n7. Computational Analysis - Estimate Methylation Levels\nGenerate .fastq files (here called sample1_R1.fastq.gz and sample1_R2.fastq.gz), generate a bismark index of the entire genome of interest (here in a folder called bismarkIndex) and make sure that the genomic sequence of chrM is available in fasta format (here in a folder called chrM).\nPre-process reads to remove adapters and bias introduced by the primers: Use the tool Trim_galore33. Remove two nucleotides from the 5' end of both the forward and reverse reads.\n\ttrim_galore --clip_R1 2 --clip_R2 2 -o ./ --trim1 --paired sample1_R1.fastq.gz sample1_R2.fastq.gz\nAlign pre-processed reads to the entire genome using Bismark34\n\tbismark --dovetail --bam -o ./ ./bismarkIndex / -1 ./sample1_R1_val_1.fq.gz -2 ./sample1_R2_val_2.fq.gz\n\tNOTE: If another aligner is used, make sure that reads that cannot be uniquely aligned are discarded.\nExtract reads mapping to the chromosome M, here using Samtools35\n\tsamtools sort -l 0 -O BAM -o sample1_sorted.bam\n\tsample1_R1_val_1_bismark_bt2_pe.bam\n\tsamtools index sample1_sorted.bam\n\tsamtools view -u sample1_sorted.bam chrM | samtools sort -n -O BAM -o sample1_chrM.bam\nExtract the methylation information\n\tbismark_methylation_extractor -p --CX --cytosine_report --comprehensive --genome_folder ./chrM ./sample1_chrM.bam\nUse the .bedGraph, the .cov or the CX_report.txt files for further analysis. Use the sample1_chrM.CX_report.txt file for visualization and testing.\nPerform further clipping in the preprocessing step, if multiple regions are interrogated and a primer bias may be visible in the M-bias plots generated during the mapping. Refer to the Bismark documentation for more information.\n8. Computational Analysis - Test of differences\nEnsure that the CX_report.txt file contains 7 columns, chromosome (here chrM), position, strand, number of methylated reads, number of unmethylated reads, C context and surrounding sequence, for every C on chromosome M.",
    "As the CX_report covers chrM in its entirety, check the subset to the region(s) which is amplified.\nUse non-parametric tests for differences between samples, such as a Fishers's exact test for individual C's or a sign-test for an entire region.\n\tNOTE: Quantification will often be close to 0% methylation, which is the reason why assuming normality is not appropriate.\nSimilarly, for visualization, either visualize quantiles or calculate binomial proportion confidence intervals.\nSubscription Required.
