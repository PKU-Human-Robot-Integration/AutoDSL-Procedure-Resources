    "Note: These procedures should be performed at the same time each day. For example, our lab times these procedures to Zeitgeber time (ZT) 1-5, relative to lights-off at ZT 12. Collection and classification of mouse vaginal smear samplesIn a 50 ml Falcon tube, dilute 10x PBS to a 1x PBS solution by adding 5 ml of 10x PBS to 45 ml of distilled water and shaking gently to mix. Place tube in tube rack and prepare a clean slide for the sample(s).Using a 20-200 μl pipette, aspirate 20 μl of 1x PBS into a 200 μl pipette tip. Retrieve mouse from cage, and place on cage top while gently holding the tail for restraint. Allow the mouse to grip the top of the cage lid. Orient the mouse so that its posterior is visible.Using the non-dominant hand, gently hold the tail of the mouse between the thumb and forefinger and gently pull upwards so that back feet come off the cage top. Use the ring and pinky fingers to gently push on the mouse’s hind quarters to angle the hips upward so as to easily view and access the vagina (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190830/20190830080133_2293.jpgFigure 1. Orientation of mouse for sample collectionWith the dominant hand, pick up the pipette. Insert the pipette tip into the mouse’s vagina approximately 0.2 cm deep, making sure to not insert the tip too far and cause internal injury or stress (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190830/20190830080158_8231.jpgFigure 2. Gentle insertion of pipette tip into vaginal cavityPipette the solution in and out 1-3 times, and aspirate as much liquid as possible to use for the smear sample.Replace the mouse in its home cage.Gently expel the smear sample onto the slide, making a vertical ellipse shape (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190830/20190830080325_0870.jpgFigure 3. Extraction of smear sample onto microscope slide.",
    "Note that multiple smears can be placed on the same slide.Repeat this step for subsequent mice until there is no room left on the slide for samples (usually 5 to 8 samples per slide).To evaluate the samples, place slide on the stage of a compound binocular microscope. Identify the stage for each sample, and record the information in a lab notebook.Once vaginal smears have been collected on a slide, they must be analyzed and classified into stages based on the cell type(s) present in each individual smear. There are four canonical cycle stages: proestrus (nucleated epithelial cells), estrus (cornified epithelial cells), metestrus (approximately 50% cornified epithelial cells and leukocytes), and diestrus (leukocytes at very high density). A stage in which only a few cells are obtained, and in which all the cells are leukocytes, can be observed, particularly when diestrus is prolonged. For the purposes of characterizing these smears and entering the data into the analysis program, give these smears the name “few”. Only one stage can be entered into the analysis program; if a smear appears to have more than one cell type (e.g., both nucleated and cornified epithelial cells), record the stage that the majority cell type represents (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190830/20190830080342_9145.jpgFigure 4. Representative smears illustrating cytology for each cycle stage. The white arrow in the “Proestrus” example indicates a nucleated epithelial cell. The red circle in the “Estrus” example indicates a cornified epithelial cell. The red arrow in the “Few” example indicates a leukocyte. Images obtained at 10x magnification. Scale bar = 100 μm.Application of Python code for data visualization and analysisGenerate an Excel file that contains the following columns:Mouse id: a unique identifier for each mouse.CycleDate: the date on which the estrous cycle monitoring was performed.CycleStage: the estrous cycle stage.",
    "The function will only take P, E, M, D, and FEW as valid estrous cycle stage data terms. The first four terms represent proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus, respectively. See Note 7 for full descriptions and visualizations of each stage. “FEW” is described as the stage following diestrus, when leukocytes are clearly still visible in the smear, but are significantly diminished in number compared to a full diestrus smear. Days listed as FEW will be plotted as D for the purposes of data visualization. Invalid data will be discarded.Time: gives a label to the period of estrous cycle monitoring. For example, if estrous cycle monitoring is performed on the same mouse before and after a drug treatment, label the data as 1 for the time before the treatment and label the data as 2 for the time after the treatment. This function enables efficient visualization and plotting of the different time periods.Note: Each row will represent the smear for a given mouse on a single day. Multiple mice can be included in the same spreadsheet, as long as they are labeled with distinct IDs. Ensure that the input Excel file has columns named exactly as described; otherwise, the plot will not be properly generated. Use the functions implemented in the pyEstrousCycle.py file.plotCycles(fileDir, animalID, saveOutPutFile, resolution, time, colors)Note: This function will generate the estrous cycle plot for a given mouse (example in Figure 5). •fileDir: the directory for the input file•animalID: a unique identifier for each mouse•saveOutPutFile: set to True to save the plot to local a directory. The default is False.•Resolution: set the dpi value for the plot. The default is 80.•Time: if needed, select time periods to group data into different sessions of monitoring in a list of values, e.g.",
    ", [1, 2] to indicate session 1 and session 2, respectively.•Colors: select colors for different time periods, listed in the order of assignment to each period of monitoring; e.g., ['black', 'red'] to assign black to session 1 and red to session 2.plotAllofThem(fileDir, saveOutPutFile, resolution, time, colors)Note: This function will generate estrous cycle plots for all mice in the input file. Input argument settings are the same as in the plotCycles function.percentage_table = analysis(fileDir, saveOutPutFile)Note: This function will calculate the percentage of time spent in each cycle stage for each mouse. Set saveOutPutFile to True to save the result table as an Excel file in the local directory.  Example code, estrous cycle data, and an example output file are provided on Github at the link above. Run the example.py code to learn how to use the Python functions and to generate example estrous cycle plots.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190830/20190830080400_8286.jpgFigure 5. Example estrous cycle plot for an individual mouse generated from the function plotCycles. The black circles and lines indicate cycle stage assessment during the first session of monitoring, and the red circles and lines indicate assessment during a second time. The dates of assessment are on the X-axis, and the observed cycle stage is on the Y-axis. P = proestrus; D = diestrus; M = metestrus; E = estrus. The number at the top of the graph signifies the mouse ID number. Note that these data were obtained from an epileptic mouse, and that during the first period of monitoring, this mouse was placed in a new environment for continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) recording, thus giving rise to more variation and irregularity in the estrous cycle pattern. Nevertheless, this example illustrates that the data acquisition and plotting method presented here can accurately reflect both regular and disrupted cycles."
