    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparing acute brain slices\nTiming: 2 h\nHere, we describe how to prepare acute brain slices from embryonic (E13-E20) or postnatal brains (≥P0) for patch clamp recording. We use both male and female animals.\nBefore you begin, prepare for the dissection and slicing.\nBubble the slicing aCSF with 95% O2 / 5% CO2 for at least 30 min (to set pH to 7.2–7.4), on ice.\nCalibrate the vibratome blade according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nPlace the slicing chamber in the freezer for at least 5 min.\nOnce it is cooled, place the slicing chamber on the vibratome, and fill the outer chamber with ice.\nOnce you have bubbled the slicing aCSF for 30 min, fill the chamber with ice-cold slicing aCSF, and continuously bubble the slicing solution with 95% O2 / 5% CO2 until the last slice is cut (step 6), so that the pH of the aCSF is maintained throughout the procedure.\nCool two beakers (one 10 mL and one 50 mL) and a glass petri dish on ice.\nFill the resting chamber with slicing aCSF and continuously bubble with 95% O2 / 5% CO2 until the end of the recording day.\nFill the two beakers with bubbled slicing aCSF (after the 30 min of bubbling).",
    "Optional: When slicing from young postnatal brains (up to P20), we suggest using a block of agarose to support the brain while slicing. This is also useful when slicing from brains regions where the required slicing angle is not readily maintained (such as the cerebellum), but is usually not needed when cutting coronal forebrain slices from adult mice, as the brain is stiff enough to remain stable when slicing at low speed. If you choose to use agarose, cut out a cube of 5% agarose and glue it on the vibratome slicing platform. Make sure that the brain will rest against a flat surface (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nOptional: If preparing embryonic slices, dissolve 1 g low melting point agarose in 50 mL of 1× recording aCSF by bringing the agarose to boiling point using a hot plate. Then, cool down the 2% agarose to avoid damaging the tissue when embedding, but do not allow it to set. This can be done while the slicing aCSF is bubbling (step 1a).\nHumanely sacrifice an animal in accordance with local regulations.\nNote: When preparing embryonic slices, sacrifice the pregnant female first, then dissect the embryos.\nRemove the head and immerse it in the 50 mL glass beaker containing bubbled slicing aCSF.\nDissect the brain.\nCut the skin along the midline, exposing the skull, and use it to hold the head by folding it under the head.\nMake a cut between the eyes, make lateral cuts in the skull anterior to posterior, and remove the skull. Alternatively, make a cut near the midline above the hindbrain, peel off the skull above the brainstem and cerebellum, and then make lateral cuts in the skull above the forebrain, posterior to anterior, and peel off the skull.",
    "Carefully extract the brain using a small spatula. For best results, dip the spatula in slicing aCSF first.\nImmerse the brain in the 10 mL glass beaker containing bubbled slicing aCSF.\nFill the glass petri dish with bubbled aCSF and transfer the brain into the petri dish using the large spatula. Keep the petri dish on ice.\nOptional: For postnatal brains, dissect the meninges, and then dissect the region of interest (for instance, the forebrain).\nOptional: For embryonic slices, fill one well in a 4-well plate halfway with the melted agarose. Place a dissected brain in the well and add more agarose to fill the well. Ensure that the brain is correctly positioned for the required slice orientation (coronal/sagittal/transverse). Repeat this procedure for each brain. Place the plate on ice or in the fridge to allow the agarose to set rapidly. We recommend preparing embryonic slices with two people: one person should dissect while the second person should embed the brains.\nGlue the brain to the vibratome slicing platform in the correct orientation for the required slices (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Consult a brain atlas to determine the right slicing orientation to keep axonal fibers intact in the region of interest.\nOptional: For embryonic slices, once the agarose has set, cut a block around the embedded brain and glue this block to the vibratome slicing platform (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nCut 225 μm–325 μm thick slices. Cut enough slices for a full day of recording.",
    "Note: Slice thickness is a compromise between axonal integrity (thicker slices allow for better axonal preservation) and cell visibility, especially when patching small cells and using fluorescent reporter lines. For instance, when recording from OPCs in postnatal brains, we typically use 225 μm thick slices. For embryonic slices, we recommend cutting 325 μm thick slices, as embryonic slices are fragile, and slice integrity is not always maintained in 225 μm thick slices. Embryonic slices are more transparent, as they are not myelinated, and thus, cell visibility is better, even with thicker slices.\nTransfer each slice into the resting chamber using the glass Pasteur pipette.\nAllow the slices to rest for 1 h before recording.\nCritical: Time is crucial when preparing acute brain slices. If the delay between sacrificing an animal and placing the brain in the ice-cold aCSF-filled vibratome chamber is too long, the slices may not be healthy enough, which will make patch clamp recordings particularly difficult. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nWhole-cell patch clamp recording in reporter mice with dye loading\nTiming: 8–10 h\nHere, we describe how to record from OPCs in acute brain slices from fluorescent reporter mice such as NG2-EYFP, NG2-dsRed, or PdgfrαCreERT2:tdTomato using whole-cell patch clamp. OPCs can be identified in acute brain slices without any fluorescent label, but this requires a trained eye, and post-hoc immunohistochemistry to confirm cell identity (for more detail on identifying oligodendrocyte lineage cells for patch clamp, see Agathou and Káradóttir (2019)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). The following steps can be used for recording non-neuronal cells in acute brain slices with or without the use of reporter mice.\nPrepare the pipettes and patch clamp set up for the day.\nFire-polish both ends of glass capillaries using a Bunsen burner (unless you are buying in fire-polished glass capillaries).",
    "Use the fire-polished capillaries to pull glass electrodes using an electrode puller. For OPCs, we recommend pulling electrodes with a 5–7 MΩ resistance.\nNote: It is possible to use electrodes with resistances as low at 4.5 MΩ to patch OPCs, but this is very challenging, as they tend to have almost the same diameter as most OPCs. A resistance of 5–7 MΩ is a good compromise between ease of seal formation, ease of cell opening, and series resistance during the recording. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7].\nThaw an aliquot of internal solution and keep it on ice and protected from light.\nNote: To record from OPCs, we typically use Cs-gluconate or K-gluconate based internal solutions. Cs-gluconate allows for more stable recordings than K-gluconate, as it blocks some K+ channels (Hille, 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). We tend to use Cs-gluconate when recording NMDA currents as these currents can be very small, and could be masked by K+ channel noise. Cs-gluconate internal is also recommended to record voltage-gated Na+ currents. When recording K+ currents, a K-gluconate based internal solution is more appropriate.\nThaw an aliquot of 4% PFA and keep it at room temperature (19°C–23°C) for fixing slices after recording.\nCritical: PFA is harmful. Handle with care. Wear gloves and use in a fume hood or under an air extraction vent.\nTurn on all the electrical equipment.\nOxygenate the recording aCSF with 100% O2 (when using a HEPES-buffered recording solution; for a bicarbonate-buffered aCSF, bubble with 95% O2 / 5% CO2) and start running the solutions through the gravity-fed perfusion. Ensure that the lines are free of air bubbles. Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.11]. Bubble the solutions throughout the recordings.\nTransfer a slice from the resting chamber into the recording chamber using a glass Pasteur pipette.",
    "Use a harp (a thin U-shaped non-conductive metal strung with nylon, for instance) to hold the slice in position at the bottom of the recording chamber.\nUse the 4/5× objective to locate the slice under the microscope, and identify the region of interest (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/583-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Choosing an OPC for whole-cell patch clamp\nThe top left panel shows a coronal forebrain slice imaged with a 5× IR-DIC objective. The cortex (CTX), corpus callosum (CC) and subventricular zone (SVZ) are labeled on the slice. A harp string is holding the slice in place. Using a low magnification objective to visualize the slice first is useful to choose the region of interest. The top right panel shows PdgfrαCreERT2:tdTomato cells in the cortex imaged with a 40× water immersion objective. Identifying potential tdTomato+ cells to patch is the second step to pick a cell to record. The bottom left panel shows a cortical OPC (black arrow head) under IR-DIC. This is a good cell for patch clamp, as it has smooth but clear outlines, is not too deep in the slice, and has good access. The bottom right panel shows a patched OPC filled with Lucifer Yellow (LY). Scale bar for the 5× image: 200 μm. Scale bar for the 40× images: 25 μm.\nSwitch to a 40×/63× immersion objective with IR-DIC optics (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nUse the fluorescence to identify reporter-expressing OPCs.\nSwitch back to brightfield to identify a good OPC to attempt patch clamp.",
    "Note: Under IR-DIC, good OPCs appear smooth, with a soft and clear outline, while shiny cells with a hard outline should be discarded as they are difficult to seal. Round cells with a visible nucleus should be avoided, as they are dying cells. Cell location (proximity to other cells, depth in the slice) cannot be assessed when using fluorescence only. Thus, it is best to alternate between fluorescence and brightfield until a suitable cell is identified (healthy, with good access and good slice depth).\nNote: When using fluorescent reporters under the NG2 promoter, we avoid cells adjacent to blood vessels, as pericytes also express NG2. Pericytes are covered by vascular basement membrane and are therefore much more difficult to seal than OPCs, requiring smaller pipette tips and/or pre-incubation of slices in collagenase, as well as a longer time to seal (Mishra et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]; Peppiatt et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]). Nonetheless, the current-voltage relationship (IV) differs between OPCs and pericytes, with pericytes displaying a different capacitive current and potassium conductance (Sakagami et al., 1999[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]). It is therefore particularly important to apply a voltage step protocol (see step 27) at the beginning of each recording, as each cell type have their specific ion channel expression and IV. We recommend consulting several IVs for the cell type of interest before starting patch clamp experiments.\nMark the location of the cell on the screen to easily locate it once the electrode is in the bath.\nFill a glass pipette with internal solution and fit it in the electrode holder on the micromanipulator headstage so that the chlorided electrode is in contact with the internal solution.\nRaise the objective so that it is still in contact with the bath solution, but there is enough space to lower the electrode into the bath.",
    "Lower the electrode into the bath, and begin applying a ±5 mV (or 10 mV) 15 ms voltage pulse every 30 ms. Display the resulting current on your computer monitor using Clampex (or another appropriate software). Continue these pulses until you have achieved whole-cell configuration (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/583-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Sealing and opening a cell\n(A) When the electrode is in the bath, applying a −5 mV voltage pulse leads to current flow across the pipette resistance (Rpipette) only. This current can be calculated using Ohm’s law, V=IR.\n(B) Once a giga-ohm seal is achieved, the same voltage step will elicit current flow across the pipette resistance and the seal resistance (Raccess). We use Ohm’s law to calculate this current, but it is near 0, as Raccess is very large. In most cells, the formation of a giga-ohm seal is not instantaneous. It can be monitored by tracking the change in current (and resistance) with (A) as a starting point and (B) as the end point.\n(C) Once the cell is open, current flows across the pipette resistance, access resistance (adding up to the series resistance, Rseries), the membrane resistance (Rmembrane) and the membrane capacitance (Cm). Analysis of the capacitive current elicited by a −5 mV step allows the calculation of Rseries, Rmembrane and Cm (see Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\nAdjust the pipette offset current to zero on the amplifier.\nApply positive pressure to prevent debris from collecting at the tip of the electrode. We use a lab-made system where we apply positive pressure by blowing into a 1 mL syringe connected to the headstage by tubing.\nNote: This initial positive pressure can be achieved by blowing into the syringe and locking the valve connecting the syringe to the tubing.",
    "Find the electrode under the microscope, and lower the electrode and objective until you are just above the cell of interest.\nIncrease the positive pressure by continuously blowing into the syringe as you approach the cell.\nWhen the electrode contacts the cell, a dimple should appear and resistance should slightly increase while current decreases. Switch from positive pressure to negative pressure (achieved by suction into the syringe).\nSet the holding potential to −60 mV on the amplifier.\nNote: We measured a junction potential of −14 mV between our internal solutions and recording aCSF. Corrected for junction potential, a holding potential of −60 mV on the amplifier is a −74 mV holding potential. However, junction potential should be measured experimentally for each internal-external solution combination, and the holding potential on the amplifier may need to be adjusted.\nContinue to apply negative pressure until a giga-ohm seal is achieved. Monitor the formation of a seal on Clampex, using the continuous voltage pulses and paying close attention to the resistance, which should reach at least 1 GΩ, and the resulting reduction in current (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\nNote: Different OPCs seal at different rates. For some cells, simply switching from positive pressure to light negative pressure is enough to obtain a giga-ohm seal. However, other cells require sustained negative pressure for 30 s–1 min before a seal is achieved. The negative pressure will have to be adapted for each cell. This can be gaged by monitoring the increase in resistance and decrease in current.\nOnce a giga-ohm seal is achieved, compensate pipette capacitance on the amplifier (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). Follow the instructions in the manufacturer’s manual to apply compensation.",
    "Apply short, hard, negative pressure pulses to open the cell. Once the cell has opened, a membrane capacitive current will be visible in response to the voltage pulses (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). In addition, the Lucifer Yellow-containing internal solution will be visible in the cell (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9].\nNote: As with sealing, different OPCs will require different negative pressure to open. Be cautious, as too much negative pressure will break the seal and the cell will have to be discarded. However, some cells will require many pulses before opening. OPCs in slices from aged mice are typically harder to open than OPCs in slices from neonates. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9].\nApply a 50 ms ± 5 mV voltage pulse. From this pulse, we calculate Rs, membrane capacitance (Cm) and membrane resistance (Rm). See quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis] for more detail.\nCompensate series resistance (Rs) (according to the instructions in the manufacturer’s manual). If recording large current changes, it is critical to compensate for Rs. Monitor Rs throughout the recording by regularly applying a 50 ms ±5 mV voltage pulse.\nNote: We recommend recording from cells with an Rs ≤ 25 MΩ. However, if Rs is larger than 25 MΩ, but the cell has a stable baseline and there is minimal leak current (see step 28), recording from OPCs with Rs ≤ 40 MΩ is still acceptable. If Rs is larger than 40 MΩ, the cell should be discarded. Similarly, if Rs changes by more than 20% throughout the recording, the cell should be discarded.",
    "Apply a protocol delivering voltage pulses to step the membrane potential from −120 mV to +40 mV (using 10 mV or 20 mV steps) and record the current responses. From this protocol, you can determine the ion channel expression in the recorded cell. While we found that OPCs are heterogeneous with respect to their voltage-gated ion channel expression (Spitzer et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]), this profile can be used to distinguish them from more mature oligodendrocytes if necessary (see Agathou and Káradóttir, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). See quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis] for more detail on quantifying voltage-gated Na+ channel current responses.\nOptional: When recording in the grey matter of adult animals, we recommend switching to a recording aCSF containing BaCl2 after the first voltage step protocol. This will block potassium conductance, which has been shown to increase with age (Maldonado et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). This is particularly important if comparing bath applied agonist responses in neonates and adults; however, avoid using BaCl2 when investigating K+ currents.\nApply any stimulation or voltage protocols and drugs required to answer your research question. For instance, in Spitzer et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25], we typically applied NMDA, then kainate, as we were studying changes in NMDA and AMPA/kainate receptors with age and brain region. See quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis] for more detail on quantifying receptor agonist responses.\nOnce you have recorded a stable baseline, bath apply NMDA first. If the cell responds, keep NMDA on until a stable peak is reached or the response begins to recover (indicating receptor desensitization). Wash out with recording aCSF. If the cell does not respond, leave NMDA on for 4–5 min to confirm that the lack of response is due to an absence of NMDA receptors, and not receptor desensitization due to a decrease in perfusion flow rate. Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.11].",
    "Once the cell has fully recovered from an NMDA response and you have acquired a stable baseline, bath apply kainate. Keep kainate on until a stable peak is reached.\nNote: If the recording becomes unstable and does not recover within a few minutes, the seal may have broken, or the cell may be dying. The recording should be stopped, as the results may become uninterpretable. Similarly, if the leak current is larger than −400 pA (in Cs-gluconate; −200 pA in K-gluconate), the recording should be stopped.\nOnce the recording is done, capture an image of the Lucifer Yellow filled cell (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Switch back to the 4/5× objective to capture an image of the pipette location on the slice (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). Record this in your lab book. This will help to locate the cell when imaging post-hoc antibody staining.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/583-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Post-hoc immunohistochemistry for cell identification and cell location\n(A) Image taken with a 5× IR-DIC objective after patch clamp, to record cell location for post-hoc immunohistochemistry. Scale bar 200 μm.\n(B) Following patch clamp of NG2-EYFP cells, and dye loading with Lucifer Yellow (LY), we fixed the slices and performed post-hoc immunohistochemistry against EYFP to confirm cell identify, and Cux1, a marker of cortical layers 2/3 to locate the cells. This image shows a cell in cortical layer 1. Scale bar 25 μm. (B) is reprinted from Spitzer et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25] (with permission according to a Creative Commons Attribution License (CC BY)).\nRemove the electrode from the cell, trying to keep the cell in the slice. Depolarizing the cell to 0 mV may help.",
    "Note: For cells with a high seal resistance (>10 GΩ), we recommend slowly pulling the pipette away and upwards. A thread of membrane should appear between the electrode and soma, and detach from the cell body, leaving it intact in the slice. If this is not sufficient, or for cells with lower seal resistance, positive pressure or moving the pipette sideways may help to detach the electrode from the cell body. When neither of these methods work, pulling the pipette away quickly, or gently taping the stage may help, although the dye may leak out. In addition, long recordings make it significantly more difficult to keep the cell in the slice when removing the electrode.\nIf attempting your next cell on the same slice, repeat steps 12–30. We recommend changing slices approximately every hour, as slice health will deteriorate in HEPES-buffered recording aCSF. If using drugs that are difficult to wash out, or bind irreversibly, change slices after each cell.\nIf changing slices, repeat steps 10–30.\nNote the slice orientation in your lab book. It may be necessary to make a mark on symmetrical slices. Use a disposable scalpel to do so. This will be helpful for post-hoc immunohistochemistry.\nImmediately fix the finished slice in 4% PFA in a 24-well plate for one hour at room temperature (19°C–23°C) on a rotating shaker, or overnight (10–20 h) at 4°C, on a rotating shaker. After fixing the slices, wash 3 × 30 min in PBS and store at 4°C in 0.05% NaN3 in PBS.\nPause Point: When kept in these conditions, fixed slices can be used for up to a month after patch clamp with successful recovery of Lucifer Yellow filled cells. However, for best results, we recommend performing immunohistochemistry within a week following patch clamp and slice fixation.",
    "Post-hoc immunohistochemistry for cell identification and cell location\nTiming: 2–3 days\nHere, we briefly describe how to use immunohistochemistry to confirm the identity of patched cells, or obtain more information on the cells, such as location (with layer specific markers for instance) or proliferative state. As this has previously been described in great detail (please consult Karadottir and Attwell (2006)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] for an in-depth protocol), we simply summarize the key steps.\nWash the slices for 15 min in PBS.\nIncubate the slices in blocking solution (10% goat or donkey serum and 0.5% Triton-X 100, in PBS) at room temperature (19°C–23°C) on a rotating shaker for 4 h.\nIncubate the slices with primary antibodies in PBS overnight (10–20 h), at room temperature (19°C–23°C) on a rotating shaker.\nNote: To confirm OPC identity, we recommend staining with an antibody against your reporter (this is not always necessary, as the endogenous signal may still be detected post-fix; however, EYFP fluorescence is quenched by PFA fixation, so using an antibody is important to detect the cells in EYFP reporter mice), or anti-NG2 or anti-Pdgfrα, two OPC markers (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). In addition, staining with anti-Olig2 (an oligodendrocyte lineage marker) can help confirm that the cell is an OPC rather than a pericyte (as pericytes are also NG2+). Appropriate markers should be used if performing this protocol with a different cell type.\nNote: To confirm cell location, a range of markers can be used, depending on the region of interest. For instance, in Spitzer et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25], we located cells within specific cortical sections. To do so, we used Cux1, which labels cells in cortical layers 2/3, and CTIP2, which labels cells in cortical layers 5/6 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nWash 3 × 30 min in PBS.",
    "Incubate the slices with secondary antibodies in PBS at room temperature (19°C–23°C) on a rotating shaker for 5 h.\nPause Point: Alternatively, the secondary antibody incubation can be done overnight (10–20 h) at 4°C on a rotating shaker.\nWash 2 × 30 min in PBS.\nIncubate with DAPI for 20 min.\nWash 30 min in PBS.\nMount the slices on glass microscope slides.\nImage the patched cells using a confocal microscope (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nNote: To locate Lucifer Yellow-filled cells in brain slices, we recommend using a low magnification objective (20×) and scanning the slice through the eyepiece. Recording the cell location after patch clamp should help to confine the search region.\nIsolation of OPCs for bulk RNA sequencing\nTiming: 5 h\nHere, we describe how to isolate OPCs from wild-type C57BL/6 mice at different timepoints using Magnetic Associated Cell Sorting (MACS). We briefly list our pipeline for RNA sequencing following cell isolation, but do not detail it, as this is not the focus of this protocol (and thus, is not included in the timing for this step).\nPause Point: This section of the protocol is independent from the preparation of acute brain slices, whole-cell patch clamp and post-hoc immunohistochemistry sections. Thus, it can be performed at any given time.\nBefore you begin, prepare for the dissection:\nPrepare a 7 mL universal tube per sample with 2 mL (adult brain) or 1 mL (neonatal or embryonic brains) papain dissociation medium.\nAdd L-cysteine to the papain dissociation medium (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) and incubate for 10 min at 37°C.\nHumanely sacrifice an animal in accordance with local regulations.\nDissect the brain (as described in Preparing acute brain slices) and place the whole brain, or the dissected region of interest in a large weighing boat.",

There are clear peaks for a marker and ribosomal RNA (18S and 28S).\n(B) Sample with high levels of genomic DNA contamination, as evidenced by the high signal in the inter region between the 18S and 28S peaks. This occurs for example when omitting DNase during the RNA extraction (see step-by step method details[href=https://www.wicell.org#step-by-step-method-details] step 60a).\n(C) Sample showing RNA degradation (with high signal immediately after the marker peak), and therefore, a low RIN. The samples shown in B and C should not be sequenced.\n(D) Sample with good quality RNA and a high RIN value.",
    "Be sure to add β-mercaptoethanol to buffer RLT, as cells isolated from tissues will be rich in RNAses (as described in the first note of the Qiagen Protocol; see Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C).\nCritical: β-mercaptoethanol is acutely toxic. Wear gloves and manipulate in a fume hood when adding to buffer RLT.\nCritical: Perform the RNA extraction in a microbiological safety cabinet, to preserve RNA.\nPause Point: RNA can be kept at −80°C until all the samples have been processed.\nRun a quality control check on the RNA\nQuantify the RNA in your samples, using a Qubit Fluorometer as this will determine which kit is needed to prepare the cDNA library. For instance, after MACS sorting OPCs, we found that our RNA concentration fell in the 250 pg–10 ng range, and therefore used the kit described in step 62.\nMeasure the RNA Integrity Number (RIN; see Schroeder et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]) using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Typically, RIN values above 7 can be used for analysis (Sheng et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]) (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nPrepare the RNA-seq library using Takara Clontech’s SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-seq Kit v2 - Pico Input Mammalian according to the manufacturer’s instructions: https://www.takarabio.com/learning-centers/next-generation-sequencing/technical-notes/rna-seq/stranded-libraries-from-picogram-input-total-rna-(v2)[href=https://www.takarabio.com/learning-centers/next-generation-sequencing/technical-notes/rna-seq/stranded-libraries-from-picogram-input-total-rna-(v2)]\nSequence the libraries on an Illumina sequencer (or another appropriate instrument).\nAssess read quality and trim the reads using standard protocols (for instance, Trim Galore! (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore[href=https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore]).\nAlign the reads to a reference mouse genome (such as e GRCm38/mm10) using standard protocols (for instance, Tophat (version 2.1.1, https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/index.shtml[href=https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/index.shtml]).\nProceed with normalization and differential expression analysis with appropriate software and protocols (for instance, the R Bioconductor DESeq2 package (Love et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html[href=https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html]).\nPerform any other required analyses, such as GO term analysis with appropriate software and protocols (for instance DAVID (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/[href=https://david.ncifcrf.gov/]) and REVIGO (Supek et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]; http://revigo.irb.hr[href=http://revigo.irb.hr])).",
