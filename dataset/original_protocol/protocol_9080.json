    "1. Preparation of Reagents\nAdd 10 µL of (1 mM) phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride solution, 10 µL (1x from 100x stock) of protease inhibitor cocktail solution, and 10 µL (1x from 100x stock) of phosphatase inhibitor cocktail solution to 1 mL of 1x radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer to prepare the complete RIPA lysis buffer.\nPrepare 10x general tubulin buffer (PEM) buffer.\nAdd 800 mM (6.0474 g) piperazine-N-N'-bis-2-ethanesulfonic acid, 10 mM (95.1 mg) ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, 10 mM (51 mg) MgCl2, and 1.25 M (3 mL of 10 M) NaOH in a 50-mL tube, mix with 15 mL distilled water, and dissolve by using a vortex. Check the pH (should be 6.9). If pH > 6.9, discard the buffer and remake a fresh lot.\n\t\tNOTE: NaOH should be below 1.25 M to ensure that pH does not overshoot 6.9. It is not advised to use HCl for adjusting pH >6.9.\nAdd NaOH dropwise until pH is 6.9. Add distilled water to make up to 25 mL of 10X PEM buffer. Finally, filter using a syringe and a 0.2 µm syringe filter. Divide this buffer into aliquots in 1.5 mL tubes and store at 4 °C.\nPrepare 5x sample buffer with reducing agent and dye.\nMix 300 µL (60 mM) of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2.5 mL (25%) of 50% glycerol, 1 mL (2%) of 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and 1.2 mL distilled water to make up 5 mL of 5x SDS sample buffer. Store at −20 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Because glycerol is viscous, measuring 1.25 mL glycerol is difficult. One mL of 100% glycerol weighs 1.26 g. Thus, weigh 1.575 g of 100% glycerol (which equals 1.25 mL of 100% or 2.5 mL of 50% glycerol) in a 15 mL tube first; mix well with the other components.",
    "2. Cell Culture, Treatment with Curcumin or LiCl Treatment, and Examination of Protein Expression\nAdd ~1 x 106 HCT 116 cells into 100 mm tissue-culture dishes containing the Minimum Essential Media (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. After one day of culturing, cells will reach 60-70% confluence.\n\tNOTE: The number of plates needed depends on the number of treatments described below.\nWhen cells reach ~65% confluence (approximated using microscopy), remove the MEM supplemented medium and add serum-free MEM with 5 µM, 10 µM, and 30 µM curcumin or 25 mM, 50 mM, and 100 mM LiCl. Incubate at 37 °C for 24 h in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.\n24 h after treatment, wash the cells with 1 mL ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and scrape the cells using a cell scraper. Transfer the scraped cells into 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes and centrifuge for 4 min at 1,800 x g at 4 °C to obtain cell pellets.\nLyse the cells by suspending the pellets in 100 µL of complete RIPA buffer at 4 °C for 20 min while regularly tapping the tubes. Sonicate the samples briefly.\nCentrifuge the cell homogenates in a benchtop centrifuge at 22,570 x g for 20 min at 4 °C. Transfer the supernatants to other labeled tubes using a pipette.\nMeasure the protein concentration in the supernatants by the Bradford assay45 using commercial protein-assay kits.\nPrepare samples of equal protein concentration (10 µg protein/13 µL sample) of cell lysates with 4X SDS gel-loading buffer. Prepared 4x SDS gel-loading buffer fresh containing 400 mM dithiothreitol (DTT).\n\tNOTE: At this stage, samples can be stored at −20 °C if needed.",
    "Incubate the samples on a heat block at 100 °C for 5 min. Mix the samples by using a vortex and wait to cool them for ~10-15 min.\nAssemble an electrophoresis system.\n\t\nLoad 10 µg protein (13 µL sample) per well on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Load the molecular-weight ladder onto the gel to one lane.\n\t\tNOTE: As electrophoresis starts, the protein ladder will resolve into protein bands of apparent molecular weights. Use these bands to estimate the molecular weights of the unknown protein bands.\nAfter loading the samples, connect the positive and negative electrodes of the electrophoresis system to a power source to maintain a constant voltage. Initially, start at 70 V for 20 min to move the protein samples from the stacking gel into the resolving gel. Then, increase the voltage to 125 V for approximately 70-120 min until samples and protein ladder reach the end of the gel.\nAfter completion of electrophoresis, transfer the gel to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane using a wet electroblotting system. Transfer for ~100 min at 100 V. Block the membrane in 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA) blocking buffer for 90 min at room temperature of around 25 °C.\nMark the blot by cutting it on the side with the molecular-weight ladder. Use a transparent plastic sheet and a sharp cutter for cutting the blot. Prepare the primary-antibody solutions (anti-tau at 1:5,000; anti-phospho-tau at 1:4,000) and incubate the blot in this solution at 4 °C overnight.\nAfter overnight incubation, wash the blot for 7 min four times in phosphate-buffered saline-Tween-20 (PBST) solution.\nPrepare the relevant secondary-antibody solutions (goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG at 1:5,000), and incubate the blot in this solution for 90 min at room temperature of around 25 °C. Wash in PBST four times, 7 min each.",
    "Develop the blot using a chemiluminescence kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cover the blot using a transparent plastic wrap. Acquire images by a chemiluminescence imaging system for chemiluminescence with relevant software.\n3. Phosphatase Assay\nTreat the cell lysates (from step 2.5) with alkaline phosphatase in the alkaline phosphatase buffer.\nFor both control and treated samples, prepare 20 µL samples containing 20 µg total protein. Add the volume of cell lysates that contains 20 µg total protein, followed by 2 µL alkaline phosphatase buffer and 10 µL alkaline phosphatase. Add distilled water to make up 20 µL.\nIncubate the samples at 37 °C for 1 h. Stop the reaction by adding ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) at a final concentration of 50 mM, or by adding sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4) at a final concentration of 10 mM. The reaction can also be stopped by heating at 75 °C for 5 min.\nBefore the incubation of samples with phosphatase finishes, prepare samples of the same concentration without adding phosphatase for comparison with phosphatase-treated samples.\nAdd the freshly prepared 4X SDS gel-loading buffer containing 400 mM DTT.\nIncubate the samples on a heat block at 100 °C for 5 min. Mix the samples using a vortex. Cool at room temperature for ~ 10-15 min.\nAssemble an electrophoresis system for running a 10% polyacrylamide gel by SDS-PAGE.\nLoad 10 µg protein (13 µL sample) per well on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Load the molecular-weight ladder.",
    "After loading the sample, connect the positive and negative electrodes of the electrophoresis system to a power source to maintain a constant voltage. Initially, start at 70 V for 20 min to move the protein samples from the stacking gel into the resolving gel. Then, increase the voltage to 125 V and run the gel for approximately 70-120 min until samples and protein ladder reach the end of the gel.\nAfter completion of electrophoresis, transfer the gel onto a PVDF membrane using a wet electroblotting system. Transfer for ~100 min at 100 V.\nMark the blot by making a small cut on the side the molecular-weight ladder. Use a transparent plastic sheet and a sharp cutter for cutting the blot.\nBlock the membrane in 4% BSA blocking buffer for 90 min at room temperature.\nIncubate the blot in primary-antibody solution (anti-tau at 1:5,000) at 4 °C overnight. Wash the blot in PBST four times, for 7 min each.\nPrepare the relevant secondary-antibody solution (goat anti-mouse IgG at 1:5,000), and incubate the blot for 90 min at room temperature. Wash in PBST four times, for 7 min each.\nDevelop the blot using a chemiluminescence kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cover the blot within a transparent plastic wrap. Acquire images by a chemiluminescence imaging system for chemiluminescence with relevant software.\n4. Microtubule-binding Assay\nFor the microtubule binding assay, repeat steps 2.1-2.6.\nPrepare 1X (2 mL) PEM buffer from 10X PEM buffer stored at 4 °C by adding 20 µM (40 µL) paclitaxel and 1 mM (20 µL) GTP. Take the microtubule (MT) stock from −80 °C freezer and the E. coli tau working stock from −20 °C freezer.\nPrepare samples as per Table 1.",
    "Incubate at 37 °C for 30 min. Ultracentrifuge at 25 °C for 60 min at 100,000 x g.\nTransfer 120 µL of supernatants containing unbound tau, to clean and labeled tubes.\nAdd 120 µL (same volume as supernatant) of 5X sample buffer to the pellet containing bound tau and mix thoroughly. Transfer the solution to clean labeled tubes and mix thoroughly.\nMeasure the protein concentration (see step 2.6).\n\tNOTE: While preparing samples, use the volume of solution (step 4.6) for preparing both the pellet and supernatant samples.\nPrepare samples of equivalent protein concentration and add freshly prepared 4x SDS gel-loading buffer containing DTT (400 mM).\n\tNOTE: Samples can be stored at −20 °C at this stage.\nRepeat steps 3.5-3.10.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\nSample,Name,Name,Microtubule needed,Microtubule needed,Main Protein needed,Main Protein needed,PEM-GTP-PTX,PEM-GTP-PTX\n1,HCT 116-Control (6.21 μg/μl),HCT 116-Control (6.21 μg/μl),2 μl,2 μl,9.66 μl (60 μg),9.66 μl (60 μg),108.34 μl,108.34 μl\n2,HCT 116-Curcumin 10 μM (4.81 μg/μl),HCT 116-Curcumin 10 μM (4.81 μg/μl),2 μl,2 μl,16.63 μl (80 μg ),16.63 μl (80 μg ),101.37 μl,101.37 μl\n3,HCT 116-Curcumin 20 μM (3.28 μg/μl),HCT 116-Curcumin 20 μM (3.28 μg/μl),2 μl,2 μl,30.49 μl (100 μg),30.49 μl (100 μg),87.51 μl,87.51 μl\n4,HCT 116-LiCl 25 mM (5.43 μg/μl),HCT 116-LiCl 25 mM (5.43 μg/μl),2 μl,2 μl,18.42 μl (100 μg),18.42 μl (100 μg),99.58 μl,99.58 μl\n5,E. coli tau,E. coli tau,2 μl,2 μl,1 μl tau-352,1 μl tau-352,117 μl,117 μl\n6,MT Only,MT Only,2 μl,2 μl,X,X,118 μl,118 μl\n,,,,,,,120 μl each,120 μl each\nTable 1: Sample preparation for microtubule-binding assay.\n5. Localization and Expression of Tau after Treatment of Cells with Curcumin\nClean a coverslip using 70% ethanol and dry it using a laboratory tissue. Insert a single coverslip in each well of a labeled 6-well tissue-culture plate. Place the plate on a biological safety cabinet and switch on a UV light for at least 3 h.",
    "Subculture the cells and seed them into the relevant wells of the 6-well plate at 2.5 x 105 cells/well in recommended culture medium.\nAfter ~24 h, examine the cells using an inverted microscope by using both the 10X and 40X objectives to check for cellular morphological changes. Record photos if needed.\nRinse the cells twice using PBS. Fix the cells in 3.7% formaldehyde in a 37 °C incubator in the dark.\n\tNOTE: Fixation by formaldehyde at room temperature works well, too. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment when handling formaldehyde.\nWash the cells in PBS. Fix cells in ice-cold methanol at −20 °C for 15 min. Permeabilize the cells by incubating them in 3% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS on ice for 10 min. Wash the cells with PBS.\nIncubate the cells in blocking buffer (3% BSA and 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS solution) for 1 h at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: Incubation for 2 h at 4 °C works well, too.\nPrepare the primary-antibody (anti-tau at 1:200) solution in 3% BSA and 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS (e.g., 2 µL tau-13 antibody in 0.4 mL buffer).\nCut small pieces of a PVDF membrane so that the pieces fit properly within each well of the 6-well plate; soak them in water for 5 min. Place the cut PVDF in each well.\nAdd 60 µL of primary antibody solution to the cut PVDF pieces in each well. Place the coverslips such that the cells can touch the primary-antibody solution. Incubate at 4 °C in a dark, humid chamber overnight. Wash in PBS four times.\nPrepare the secondary-antibody solution (fluorescein-conjugated 594 anti-mouse IgG at 1:400) in 3% BSA and 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS.",
    "Cut small pieces of a PVDF membrane so that the pieces fit properly within each well of the 6-well plate, and soak them in water for 5 min. Place the cut PVDF in each well.\nAdd 80 µL of the secondary-antibody solution to each of the PVDF pieces in the 6-well plate. Place the coverslip such that the cells can touch the secondary-antibody solution. Incubate in a dark, humid chamber at room temperature for 2 h. Wash with PBS four times.\nMount samples in the mounting medium with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and fix the coverslips on glass slides.\nAdd one drop of the mounting medium with DAPI on glass slides. Remove the coverslips from each well and place them on the glass slides containing the mounting medium with DAPI. Ensure that the surface of each coverslip containing stained cells touches the mounting medium on the corresponding glass slide.\nApply nail polish all around each coverslip to seal and fix them airtight on the glass slides. If needed, do this step twice.\nIncubate for 1.5 h at room temperature in a dark chamber.\nExamine the slides using a confocal microscope by using immersion oil on the coverslip in a dark room.\nSubscription Required.
