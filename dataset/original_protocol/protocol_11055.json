    "1. Culturing cancerous urothelial cells and isolation of EVs\nNOTE: A protocol to obtain EVs from a human invasive bladder cancer urothelial (T24) cell line is presented. However, culturing conditions have to be optimized to use other cell types.\nPlate T24 cells with a density of 3 × 104 cells/cm2 in three flasks (growing surface of 75 cm2) and start with culturing the cells in a CO2 incubator for 3 days at 37 °C and a 5% CO2 (Figure 2A).\n\t\nUse a culture medium for T24 cells in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of A-DMEM and F12 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 4 mM Glutamax, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 100 U/mL penicillin.\n\t\tNOTE: The following isolation yields EVs enriched in MVs. Before starting the isolation, inspect the cells with a light microscope to confirm viability and confluence (Figure 2B). Start collecting the EVs from the conditioned culture media when the T24 cells are at 70% confluence.\nCollect the culture medium with MVs with a pipette from flasks (T75) into conical centrifuge tubes (Figure 2C). Centrifuge at 300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C (Figure 2D).\nCarefully collect the supernatant into a new centrifuge tube with the pipette (Figure 2E).\nCentrifuge the supernatant at 2,000 × g  for 20 min at 4 °C.\nCarefully collect the supernatant with the pipette into a new centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge at 10,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. Look for the presence of a whitish pellet at the bottom of the tube.\n\tNOTE: If necessary, change the centrifuge rotor to reach the required g-force. The EV pellet is seen as a white pellet at the bottom of the centrifuge tube (Figure 2F); mark its location to avoid losing the pellet during pipetting (Figure 2G).",
    "Carefully discard the supernatant with a pipette. To the pellet, add 1.5 mL of PBS and resuspend the pellet containing MVs. Put the suspension into a new centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge at 10,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C and look for the presence of a white pellet at the bottom of the tube.\n\tNOTE: The EV pellet is seen as a white patch at the bottom of the centrifuge tube; mark its location to avoid losing the pellet during pipetting.\nCarefully discard the supernatant with a pipette. Gently add the fixative, 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2). Leave for 20 min at 4 °C (Figure 2H).\n\tCAUTION: Glutaraldehyde and sodium cacodylate are toxic. Work in a fume hood, wear protective gloves, and discard them appropriately.\nCarefully remove the fixative with a pipette. Add washing buffer (0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer) to the pellet. Leave for 10 min at 4 °C without resuspending the pellet.\n2. Freezing of EVs\nNOTE: Before freezing, first cryoprotect the samples with glycerol.\nPrepare 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer. Remove the washing buffer and add 50 µL of 30% glycerol in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer. Gently resuspend the EVs to make the solution homogeneous. Incubate for 30 min at 4 °C.\nClean the copper carriers with a central pit in the ultrasonic bath with chloroform for 5 min (Figure 3A). Air dry them and mark them with colors if using multiple samples (Figure 3B). Until use, keep the carriers in a dry, clean place (e.g., on lens paper in a Petri dish). Do not touch the carriers with bare hands.\n\t\nPrepare pipettes, solutions, filter paper, tweezers, a stereomicroscope, a Dewar flask with freon and liquid nitrogen (LN2), a metal rod, and cryovials. Cool it down with LN2.",
    "CAUTION: Wear protective equipment and work accordingly when handling LN2 and cooled freon.\nResuspend the EVs again before freezing. Avoid the formation of air bubbles.\n\tNOTE: Perform steps 2.4-2.7 rapidly.\nWork under a stereomicroscope (Figure 3C). Transfer 1.5-1.7 µL of the sample into the central pit of the copper carrier to make a convex drop reaching higher than the copper carrier edge while not spilling the sample over the edge (Figure 3D). In case of overspill, use filter paper to dry the outer ring of the carrier.\nMix solidified freon with a metal rod to liquefy it again (Figure 3E).\nGrip the outer ring of the copper carrier with tweezers and immerse it into cooled freon with a gentle shaking of tweezers for 8 s (Figure 3F). After 8 s, quickly transfer the carrier into another Dewar flask filled with LN2.\nProceed immediately with fracturing or storing the samples in LN2. In the latter case, mark a cryovial and cool the vial and tweezer tips by submerging them into LN2 (Figure 3G). Under LN2, collect frozen copper carriers into the vial, close it, and store them in the LN2 container (Figure 3H) until freeze fracturing.\n3. Fracturing of EVs and making the replicas\nNOTE: Prepare the freeze-fracturing unit according to the manufacturer's operating instructions. (Figure 4A). Clean the chamber of the unit. Position platinum (Pt/C) and carbon (C) guns at angles of 45° and 90°, respectively (Figure 4B).\nStart the unit vacuum system. When pressure of 6.6 × 10−2 Pa (5 × 10−4 Torr) is reached, cool down the unit chamber to −150 °C.",
    "Transfer the copper carriers with frozen samples into a freeze-fracturing unit using dry tweezers (Figure 4C). Use cryotransfer or work fast to avoid thawing the sample and deposition of the ice crystals. Secure the carriers onto the sample table.\nWait until the vacuum reaches again 6.6 × 10−2 Pa (5 × 10−4 Torr), and then set the knife temperature to −100 °C (Figure 4D).\nWait until the vacuum reaches 1.0 × 10−3 Pa (8 × 10−6 Torr).\nObserve the sample with binoculars and carefully approach the knife (Figure 4E).\nBegin sectioning the sample by turning on the motorized movement of the knife (Figure 4F) and section until the surface of the sample is smooth (Figure 4G).\nFor fracturing, turn off the motorized movement of the knife and proceed with slow manual control of the knife, thereby fracturing the sample (Figure 4H). In order to protect the fractured surface from forming ice crystals and debris until shadowing, move the knife above the fractured sample.\nProceed with the Pt shadowing at 45° (Figure 4I, J).\n\t\nPrepare a stopwatch and/or turn on the quartz crystal monitor on the freeze-fracturing unit, which will allow supervision of the thickness of the Pt on the sample. The recommended thickness of the Pt layer as measured on the quartz crystal monitor is 2.5 nm, which corresponds to 4 s of shadowing at a given high tension and current (i.e., the speed of Pt shadowing is 0.63 nm/s).\nBefore starting the shadowing, move the knife away from the sample. Apply high tension on the Pt/C gun (1,600 V), and increase the current to 60 mA. Sparks of Pt should appear and should begin to shadow the sample. At this point, start the 4 s countdown and/or observe and locate the position of Pt on the quartz crystal monitor.",
    "NOTE: The recommended thickness of the C layer is 2.5 nm, which corresponds to 10 s of shadowing at a given high tension and current.\nTurn off the current and high tension when the desired thickness of Pt is obtained.\nProceed with the C shadowing at 90° (i.e., the speed of C shadowing is 0.25 nm/s).\n\t\nApply high tension on the C gun (1,900 V), increase the current to 90 mA, and sparks of C should appear and begin to shadow the sample; at that moment, start the 10 s countdown. Turn off the current and high tension when the desired thickness of C is obtained.\n4. Cleaning the replicas and replica analysis\nUse the copper carriers from the sample table and transfer them with tweezers to distilled water at room temperature in a porcelain 12-well plate (Figure 4K). The replicas will float on the water surface, while the carriers sink (Figure 4L).\nTransfer the replicas with a wire loop from distilled water into a well with sodium hypochlorite. Cover and leave overnight at room temperature in a fume hood.\n\tCAUTION: Sodium hypochlorite is toxic. Work in a fume hood, wear protective gloves, and discard them appropriately.\nTransfer the replicas to ddH2O and wash for 30 min. Repeat 3 times.\nTransfer the replicas with a wire loop to a mesh copper TEM grid (e.g., square or honeycomb 100+ mesh). Air dry the grids for 2 h, and then store them in a grid storage box until microscopy.\n\tNOTE: Generally, grids can be stored for months in dark, dry, room temperature conditions.\nUse a TEM microscope to image the replicas and obtain micrographs.\n\t\nTo do so, insert a TEM grid with a replica and start the TEM imaging according to the manufacturer's operating manuals. Work at 80 kV or 100 kV.",
    "Inspect the sample and acquire micrographs at lower and higher magnifications with a camera on TEM.\nAnalyze the micrographs of the MVs. For measurements of the MV diameters, use Fiji/ImageJ software16. The diameter of MVs is 4/π times the measurement on the micrographs according to Hallett et al.17."
