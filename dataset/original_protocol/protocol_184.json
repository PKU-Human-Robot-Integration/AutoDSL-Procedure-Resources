    "**Restriction digest**\n**1 |** Prepare intact, high-quality genomic DNA samples each containing 1 µg at a high concentration \\(at least 250 ng µl<sup>-1</sup>). Dilute all samples to the same volume \\(4 µl) with nuclease free water.\n**2 |** Prepare a master mix for restriction digest by combining the following components in a single tube and mixing thoroughly by back-pipetting. The volumes listed here are intended for a single reaction, so multiply by the number of samples plus some small amount for pipetting error.\n0.6 µl 10X Buffer R\n0.4 µl 150 µM SAM \n1.0 U AlfI\nNuclease-free water \\(NFW) to total volume 2.0 µl\n**3 |** Combine 2 µl master mix with each 4 µl DNA sample, and incubate 1 hr at 37°C, then inactivate the enzyme at 65°C for 20 min and hold samples on ice.\n**Adaptor ligation**\n**1 |** Prepare two partially double stranded adaptors by combining each pair of oligonucleotides at a final concentration of 4 µM each. Adaptor 1 is prepared by combining sld-ada1-AlfI and anti-sld-ada1, and adaptor 2 by combining sld-ada2-AlfI and anti-sld-ada2 \\(Table 1).\n**2 |** Prepare a master mix for ligation by combining the following components in a single tube. The volumes listed here are intended for a single reaction, so scale up as needed.\n0.5 µl 10 mM ATP\n2.0 µl 10X T4 ligase buffer\n2.5 µl 5 µM Adaptor 1\n2.5 µl 5 µM Adaptor 2\n11.5 µl NFW\n**3 |** Combine 20 µl master mix with 5 µl of digested DNA.  Incubate for 1 hour \\(16°C for heat-inactivatable enzymes e.g. AlfI, or at 4°C for enzymes that cannot be inactivated, e.g. BsaXI), then hold on ice.\n**Barcode incorporation**",
    "**1 |** Conduct a test-scale PCR to determine the minimum number of cycles required to produce a visible product, and evaluate relative yield across samples. Prepare a master mix for PCR by combining the following components in a single tube, and mix thoroughly by backpipetting. The volumes listed here are intended for a single reaction, so scale up as needed.\n6.5 µl NFW\n2.5 µl 2.5 mM dNTP\n0.4 µl 10 µM sld-p5\n0.4 µl 10 µM sld-p6\n1.0 µl 1 µM sld-p3\n1.0 µl 1 µM sld-p4 \\(barcode)\n4.0 µl 5X HF buffer\n0.2 µl Phusion polymerase\n**2 |** Combine 16 µl master mix with 4 µl ligation from each sample, and amplify on the following profile: \\(98°C 5 sec, 60°C 20 sec, 72°C 10 sec) X 12 cycles.\n**3 |** Sample 5 µl from each reaction at two-cycle intervals \\(n = 6, 8, 10, & 12 cycles). The thermocycler can be paused during each sampling interval. \n**4 |** Visualize PCR products using standard gel electrophoresis methods \\(2% agarose TBE gel), including a low-molecular weight marker. Select the minimum number of cycles required to produce a visible product at ~130 bp.\n**5 |** Prepare a master mix for preparatory-scale PCR by combining the following components in a single tube, and mix thoroughly by backpipetting. The volumes listed here are intended for a single reaction, so scale up as needed.\n32.5 µl NFW   \n12.5 µl 2.5 mM dNTP\n2.0 µl 10 µM sld-p5\n2.0 µl 10 µM sld-p6\n5.0 µl 1 µM sld-p3\n5.0 µl 1 µM sld-p4 \\(barcode)\n20.0 µl 5X HF buffer\n1.0 µl Phusion polymerase\n**6 |** Combine 80 µl master mix with 20 µl ligation and amplify using the optimal cycle number determined in step 4.\n**Gel purification**",
    "**1 |** Resolve samples on 2% agarose gels using standard electrophoresis methods and reagents. Large wells are required to accommodate each 100 µl sample in a single well.\n**2 |** Using a UV transilluminator set to low intensity, excise the target band \\(~130 bp) from each lane, being careful to limit the UV exposure of each sample to no more than 30 seconds. \n**3 |** Extract preparations from excised gel slices either:\nA. using a commercial gel-extraction kit of your choice according to the manufacturers instructions; or\nB. by eluting directly from the gel slice into water \\(40 µl NFW in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube). Gel slices are held overnight at 4°C, and the eluent collected the following morning. \n**4 |** Collect a small aliquot \\(~2-10 µl) from each preparation and combine in a multiplex pool for sequencing. Remaining preparations can be held for 6 months at -20°C and sampled again for sequencing if additional coverage is required for any samples."
