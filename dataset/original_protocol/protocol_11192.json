    "Human samples used in the following experiments were obtained from reduction mammoplasties carried out at Clínica Pilar Sant Jordi (Barcelona) under standard procedure consent. All procedures are performed in a Class II Biological Safety Cabinet unless otherwise stated.\n1. In vitro culture of human mammary epithelial cells and growth curve plot build-up\nIn vitro culture of breast primary epithelial cells (BPECs): cell passaging\n\tNOTE: For BPEC derivation and cell culture follow instructions described by Ince et al., 20076.\n\t\nMedium preparation.\n\t\t\nSupplement WIT basal defined medium with P or T supplements, provided by the manufacturer, depending on whether primary or transformed BPECs are cultured.\nAdd cholera toxin to the supplemented WIT medium to a final concentration of 100 ng/mL for primary or 25 ng/mL for transformed BPECs.\n\t\t\tCAUTION: Cholera toxin is fatal if swallowed. Use personal protective equipment. Avoid its release to the environment.\nCell culture maintenance and passaging.\n\t\tNOTE: For the following steps keep in mind that cells are growing in a T25 flask. Nonetheless, volumes can be adapted to other cell culture formats maintaining the proportionality in terms of surface area.\n\t\t\nCheck on the cell confluency every day. When the culture is 90% confluent, perform cell passaging.\nAcquire 1x PBS, 3x trypsin, medium and a 15 mL conical tube containing 2 mL of Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) for each flask.\nRemove the medium from the flask and keep it in the 15 mL conical tube containing FBS.\nRinse cells with 1x PBS.\nDetach cells from the surface by adding 1 mL of 3x trypsin. Incubate for 5 min at 37 ˚C.\nCheck if cells have been detached. Apply vigorous shaking if cells are not completely detached.\nInactivate trypsin by adding the reserved medium supplemented with FBS.\nHarvest the cellular suspension and place it in the 15 mL conical tube.",
    "Centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min, eliminate the supernatant, and resuspend the pelleted cells by flicking the bottom of the tube with a finger.\nAdd 1–2 mL of fresh media to the pellet and measure the cell concentration using an automatic cell counter or a hemocytometer. This data will later be used to calculate the population doublings and draw the growth curve. Seed 12,000 cells/cm2 (e.g., 300,000 cells for a T25 flask) in modified cell culture surface flasks (see Table of Materials).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Dilute the cell suspension solution if the concentration is too high to ensure proper quantification.\nAdd medium to a final volume of 5 mL and incubate the cells at 37 ˚C and 5% CO2 atmosphere.\nReplace the cell culture medium every 48 h.\nPopulation doubling calculation and data visualization\nUsing data of the cell count obtained in the step 1.1.2.10, apply the following formula to obtain the accumulated population doubling (PD) values:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61716/61716equ01.jpg\n\t\tWhere, PDi denotes the number of population doublings achieved by the cells until the previous subculture (it refers to the PD accumulated on the previous subculture), Nh is the number of harvested cells, and Ns is the number of seeded cells.\nRepresent data for a specific interval of time using an XY graph where the number of days in culture (x-axis) and the accumulated PD (y-axis) are represented.\nGet the best-fit line and the fitting equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61716/61716equ02.jpg\n\t\tNOTE: An increased slope (b) means an increased proliferation rate.\n2. Three-dimensional (3D) culture in basement membrane matrix and immunofluorescent protein detection\n3D culture in basement membrane matrix\n\tNOTE: This protocol has been adapted from Debnath et al., 200310 and is optimized for 24 well plates (see Table of Materials).",
    "Prepare the material a day before the experiment: pre-chill basement membrane matrix overnight at 4 ˚C and let pipette tips, microcentrifuge tubes, and well plates cool in the freezer.\n\t\tNOTE: The matrix must be kept at -20 ˚C for long-term storage. Make aliquots to avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.\nOn the day of the experiment, place pre-cooled material on ice.\nRinse wells with cold sterile 1x PBS in order to reduce surface tension.\nCover the bottom of each well with 100 µL of basement membrane matrix.\n\t\tNOTE: Dispense the matrix slowly and spread it throughout the well; it is crucial to avoid bubble formation in the bottom layer to avert monolayer cell culture growth.\nPlace the plate in the incubator, at 37 ˚C, to let the matrix layer solidify.\n\t\tNOTE: It usually takes about 20 min to solidify.\nMeanwhile, trypsinize cells as explained previously in step 1.1. Centrifuge the cells at 500 x g for 5 min and resuspend in medium. Prepare a 400,000 cells/mL suspension and gently disaggregate any cell clump by pipetting.\nPrepare the medium with 8% basement membrane matrix and mix 1:1 (v/v) with cellular suspension to obtain a 200,000 cells/mL solution in 4% matrix.\n\t\tNOTE: Calculate the amount of medium needed to avoid matrix unnecessary waste.\nPlace 500 µL of cell suspension in matrix solution on top of the already solidified matrix layer to seed a total amount of 100,000 cells in medium with 4% basement membrane matrix.\nIncubate cells at 37 ˚C for a few minutes and then, add 500 µL of the medium with 4% basement membrane matrix. Incubate the cells at 37 ˚C in an incubator with 5% CO2 for 14 days. Seeded cells will group and proliferate to originate the acini-like structures.",
    "NOTE: Cell motility and aggregation can be monitored by time-lapse during the 3D formation process. Use image analysis software (e.g., Fiji/ImageJ or Imaris) to evaluate these events. The number and size of the acini depend on the aggregation process and the proliferation rate and might vary between cell types. Adjust basement membrane matrix concentration and seeded cells to obtain desired 3D structures.\nAdd 500 µL of the medium with 4% basement membrane matrix 2–3 times per week.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid disturbance of the layers carrying the plate gently during manipulation.\nIf desired, the number and size of acini can be measured during the culture period. To do so, take random pictures at different times after seeding using a phase contrast or DIC inverted microscope. Use image analysis software to measure the diameter of 100–200 3D structures.\nImmunostaining\n\tNOTE: Sterile conditions are not required during this part of the protocol.\n\t\nRemove the culture medium.\nTear the basement membrane matrix using a p200 pipette tip with the end cut off. Place ~50 µL of disaggregated matrix on top of a glass slide and smear it in an area of 1–2 cm2.\nLet the sample dry completely at room temperature or use a heating plate at 37 ˚C to accelerate the process. Fix samples with methanol:acetone (1:1, v/v) at -20 ˚C for 30 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Fluorescent signal of previous markers, such as that of fluorescent proteins expressed by the cells, will be erased.\n\t\tCAUTION: Methanol is flammable, toxic if inhaled, swallowed or in case it comes in contact with skin. Wear personal protective equipment and work inside a fume hood.\nDiscard the fixation solution and remove the excess, if any, by reclining the slide on filter paper.",
    "NOTE: The protocol can be paused here. Once dry, slides can be stored at -20 ˚C for several months.\nBlock samples epitopes with 5% normal goat serum and 0.1% triton-X-100 in 1x PBS (blocking solution) for 2 h at room temperature.\nMeanwhile, prepare antibodies working solutions by diluting primary or secondary antibodies at the desired concentration in blocking solution.\n\t\tNOTE: Antibody concentration must be accurately adjusted depending on the cell type and the antibody reference. As a guide, to identify cells from luminal and myoepithelial lineages in BPEC, primary anti-Cytokeratin 14 and anti-Claudin-IV antibodies (see Table of Materials) can be used. The recommended working solution concentration is 1:100 for these primary antibodies and 1:500 for anti-Mouse and anti-Rabbit secondary antibodies (see Table of Materials).\nAdd 30 µL of primary antibodies working solution and cover it with a strip of laboratory wrapping film to avoid evaporation. Incubate overnight at 4 ˚C in a humid chamber.\nWash three times with 1x PBS for 1 h each.\nRepeat step 2.2.7 for secondary antibodies. Incubation should be performed in darkness.\nWash with 1x PBS for 2 h.\n\t\tNOTE: Adjust antibodies concentration, incubation time, and washing hardness to improve the signal/noise ratio for specific samples.\nRemove the remaining PBS and, once dry, counterstain with DAPI at 0.25 µg/mL diluted in antifade mounting medium. Cover slides with a coverslip by letting it settle without applying pressure. Seal with nail polish.\n\t\tNOTE: Samples can be stored at 4 ˚C for several weeks. For long-term storage, keep them at -20 ˚C.\nAnalyze fluorescent signal distribution for each acinus using a confocal microscope.",
    "NOTE: Confocal microscope configuration must be accurately determined depending on the equipment used and the antibodies applied to the sample. As a guide, with the equipment and reagents detailed in the Table of Materials, use a 40x objective and the following laser and detector settings: for DAPI use excitation with a 405 laser (3%–5%), detection with a PMT detector (800V, Offset: -9) and a spectral band from 410 nm to 500 nm; for A488 (Claudin-IV) use excitation with a 488 laser (7%–10%), detection with a PMT detector (800V, Offset: -20) and a spectral band from 490 nm to 550 nm; and for Cy3 (Cytokeratin 14) use excitation with a 555 laser (2%–10%), detection with a PMT detector (800V, Offset: -35) and a spectral band from 560 nm to 600 nm.\n3. Anchorage-independent assay, MTT staining and automatic colony quantification\nAnchorage-independent assay: agar and cellular suspension plating\n\tNOTE: Protocol has been adapted from Borowicz et al., 201411 to perform experiments in BPECs.\n\t\nPrepare a 1.2% agar solution diluted in ultrapure water in a sterile bottle. Autoclave the solution and maintain it at 42 ˚C during the experiment. The agar solution can be stored at 4 ˚C; when required, heat the agar solution until it is liquid again.\n\t\tCAUTION: Use heat-resistant gloves to avoid burn after autoclave.\n\t\tNOTE: From now on, sterile conditions must be maintained.\nPrepare a 0.6% agar solution by mixing 1:1 (v/v) complete pre-warmed medium with 1.2% agar solution. Maintain at 42 ˚C to avoid premature solidification.\n\t\tNOTE: Medium can be previously double supplemented to obtain a fully supplemented 0.6% agar + medium solution once mixed.",
    "Cover the bottom of a 35 mm well with 1.5 mL of 0.6% agar in medium solution and let it solidify at room temperature. Make sure that the bottom of the plate is completely covered before agar solidification, otherwise, cells may adhere to the plate and grow in monolayer.\n\t\tNOTE: Adherent and non-adherent surface plates can be used.\nMeanwhile, trypsinize cells and, once centrifuged and resuspended in medium, prepare a 50,000 cells/ml solution and gently disaggregate any cell clump by pipetting repeatedly.\nPrepare a 0.3% agar + cell suspension in the medium at a final concentration of 25,000 cells/mL.\n\t\tNOTE: Optimal cell concentration may differ among cell types. Try different concentrations until individualized colonies are formed.\n\t\t\nPlace a 40 µm strainer filter on top of a 50 mL sterile tube and filter the 50,000 cells/mL solution letting it drop into the bottom of the tube.\nRemove the filter from the 50 mL sterile tube, tilt the cell-containing tube to a 45˚ angle and drop the same volume of 0.6% agar + medium solution pouring it through the internal wall of the tube. This will allow the agar solution to cool down just enough to not damage the cells and avoid its premature solidification.\nHomogenize the mixture and deposit 1 mL of 0.3% agar + cell suspension in the medium (containing 25,000 cells) on top of the previously solidified bottom agar layer.\nVisualize seeded cells using an inverted microscope to make sure that the cells are individualized. Otherwise, the experiment should be repeated.\nWait until the agar layer is completely solidified, then carefully add 1 mL of the fresh medium on top without disturbing the delicate agar layers beneath.\nIncubate the cells at 37 ˚C and 5% CO2 in an incubator for 3 weeks.",
    "NOTE: The time required for colony formation can vary among different cell types, but usually 3 weeks are sufficient.\nChange medium twice per week. To do so, gently tilt the plate toward you, aspirate medium in the lower corner, and add 1 mL of fresh medium.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid touching the agar layers as they easily detach from the plate.\nMTT staining\nPrepare Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide (MTT) stock solution at 6 mg/mL in ultrapure water in a sterile bottle and filter solution using 0.2 µm filters. This MTT solution can be stored for up to 6 months at -20 ˚C.\n\t\tCAUTION: MTT may cause irritation and is suspected of causing genetic defects. Use safety glasses, gloves, and a respiratory filter.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.\nPrepare a working solution of MTT at 1 mg/mL by diluting the stock solution with sterile ultrapure water.\nOnce the colony formation period has concluded, remove the medium from the plate and add 1 mL of 1 mg/mL MTT to each well.\nIncubate for 24 h in the incubator. Remove the MTT solution by aspirating it gently. Plates can be stored at 4 ˚C for several weeks.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid light exposure to prevent non-specific crystal formation.\nColony quantification\nObtain images of each plate using an inverted microscope. Adjust the magnification in order to acquire the maximum field of view with fewer images and still being able to detect small colonies (usually 4x or 10x objectives).\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure that images present a homogeneous background. Neither phase-contrast nor differential interference contrast is required since non-stained colonies will not be quantified.\nUpload images to ImageJ/Fiji software12 to count the number of colonies and the area of each MTT-positive colony.",
    "NOTE: A script for automatic quantification is provided as a Supplementary File. To execute the code, paste it to the macro editor (Plugins | New | Macro) and follow the instructions.\n\t\t\nObtain a binary mask through thresholding the original image (Image | Adjust | Threshold) to obtain well-delimited colonies (Figure 1).\n\t\t\tNOTE: 8- or 16-bit images are usually required to perform this step. The “Minimum threshold” method is recommended.\nRun the Extended Particle Analyzer from Biovoxxel plugin13 (Plugins | BioVoxxel | Extended Particle Analyzer) to identify MTT positive colonies (Figure 2). Initial guiding conditions: Size (µm2) = 250–Infinity; Solidity = 0.75–1.00.\nEstimate the average diameter (D) from each colony area value (A) according to the formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61716/61716equ03.jpg\nFilter results by excluding low proliferative colonies (e.g., low diameter).\n\t\t\nChoose a minimum number of divisions per week (m) to be considered (e.g., 1).\nEstimate the radius of a colony (R) with n cells according to the following formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61716/61716equ04.jpg\n\t\t\tWhere, r is the average radius of individual cells in suspension, n is the number of cells forming a colony that suffered m divisions each week during w weeks in culture. In exponential growth: n = 2(m*w). ρ is the Packaging efficiency. Note that, in random movement, packaging efficiency is ~0.64 and the densest possible packing fraction for identical spheres is 0.7414.\nDiscard all colonies that present a diameter lower than 2R as their cells have not achieved the minimum number of divisions considered in step 3.3.4.1.\nSubscription Required.
