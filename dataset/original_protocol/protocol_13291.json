    "This research procedure closely adhered to the rules of human research ethics committee of China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University. Patients who underwent radiofrequency ablation of atrial fibrillation were searched on the Carto system (3D mapping system). Then, the PACS system was used to determine whether the patient underwent left atrial CT examination before surgery to ascertain that each selected patient had left atrial CT images for comparison. Soundstar is the ICE catheter used in this study, and a Cartosound module is available in the 3D mapping system. Each patient provided written informed consent before ICE 3D modeling.\n1. Preparation before scanning\nCheck patient information, such as accurate heart rate, rhythm, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation. Let the patient be supine with the arms on both sides and the thighs slightly abducted.\nProvide deep conscious sedation with fentanyl (200 µg/mL) to all patients throughout the procedure. Select the right femoral vein as the puncture point, which is disinfected and paved for local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine.\nSet up the ICE catheter: Connect the ICE catheter tail line with the 3D mapping system and an ultrasonic machine. Open the Study interface in the 3D mapping system and select P500 in Connected Machines.\nPlace the ICE catheter (Diameter: 10f; ultrasound mode: B-mode) inside the femoral vein. During the pushing process, monitor the ultrasound in real-time to ensure that the catheter is in a safe space.\nPass the ablation catheter to the right atrium to develop the right atrium and coronary sinus model. Place the coronary sinus electrode by combining it with ICE guidance.",
    "After the ICE catheter enters the right atrium, ensure that the left atrium and left atrial appendage structure are displayed on the 3D mapping system display screen using the short and long axes of the left atrium while excluding the left atrial thrombus.\nDetermine the optimal puncture site under ICE guidance after inserting the atrial septal puncture needle. Then, perform transseptal puncture.\n\t\nUse the Home view to confirm that the ICE reached the right atrium. Then the software displays the left PV section. Click Right Bend to demonstrate the inferior vena cava and atrial septum.\nMove the puncture needle sheath to point in the four o'clock direction. Retract the needle sheath to the oval fossa while monitoring ICE, and the \"tent sign\" is visible.\nAdjust the ICE catheter to reveal the left PV as a \"rabbit ear sign.\" Under ICE guidance, slowly withdraw the needle sheath to the lower edge of the oval fossa.\nRotate the puncture needle clockwise to break through the oval fossa. Then, inject heparin saline through the atrial septum puncture needle.\n\t\t​NOTE: Salt blisters were observed in the LA, indicating successful puncture of the atrial septum.\n2. 3D modeling of the left atrium and pulmonary vein\nNOTE: The ICE constructs the left atrium model in two directions.\nAfter pushing the ICE catheter into the femoral vein, pass it through the inferior and superior vena cava and enter the right atrium.\nPush the ultrasound catheter to the middle of the right atrium on the short axis and rotate clockwise. Now, the ultrasound fan points toward the one o'clock (Home view) direction depicting the right atrium and the right ventricle.",
    "Tighten the Tension Knob to achieve locking tension tuning. Then turn to the Home view and click Antecurvature (A) to fully display the tricuspid annulus. Attach to the tricuspid annulus for gating training and use the end-breath phase modeling.\nFrom the Home view, turn clockwise to the left atrial anterior wall, leading to the appearance of the left atrial appendage.\nContinue the clockwise turn to the left atrium, leading to the appearance of the left upper and lower pulmonary veins, displayed as a \"rabbit ear sign.\" Then, turn it clockwise and counterclockwise to precisely gather the image of the left pulmonary veins by identifying the anterior and posterior venus boundaries.\nContinue to turn clockwise to the left atrium, establishing the posterior wall, and in the process, the esophagus appears as the \"double track sign.\"\nTurn to the left atrium along the clockwise direction to observe the right lower pulmonary vein, displayed as a \"3-word sign\". Then, turn it clockwise and counterclockwise to precisely capture the image of the right pulmonary veins by identifying the anterior and posterior boundaries.\nOn the long axis, click Palintrope (P) to make the tip of the catheter at the same height as the coronary sinus mouth. This supplements the left atrium model. Adjust Left Bend/Right Bend (L/R) to observe the front wall of the long axis of the left atrium. This image captures the anterior wall of the left atrium.\nMark the important anatomical locations, including pulmonary vein ostia, left atrial appendage, and other vital sites accordingly (Video 1).\n3. Image acquisition and measurement of the pulmonary vein area\nLeft atrial CT\n\t\nOpen the PACS system by double-clicking the icon. Click on Advanced Query to enter the patient name and inspection item. Click OK to find the image.",
    "Click on Tune to transfer the image to the vue pacs system (picture archiving and communication system).\nTransfer the 3D volume reconstruction image to the work box and click Export Image to save the left atrial posterior anterior (PA), left later (LL), and right lateral (RL) position images within the folder.\nAfter returning to the previous program, transfer the left atrial arterial phase enhancement sequence to the work box, and click on the image displayed as 3D.\nDouble-click on the 3D image, then click on 3D in the toolbar. Select the Resection Tool to remove the ribs, spine, aorta, and other structures to expose the left atrium and pulmonary vein system.\nExpose the pulmonary vein vestibule. Click on Figure in the toolbar and select Area to calculate the cross-sectional area of the pulmonary vein vestibule.\nICE\n\t\nOpen the 3D mapping system. Then, click on Review Study and enter the name of the patient. Finally, use Search for Current Patient to identify the image.\nClick on OK to open the work interface.\nClick on Study > Continue Study and select the Model and Channel sequences.\nClick on Capture Preferences, then select Region and adjust the image to \"Posterior-anterior\", \"Left lateral,\" \"Right lateral,\" \"Left anterior oblique (LAO),\" and \"Right anterior oblique (RAO).\"\nClick on Picture, select the photo area, and click OK to save the picture.\nClick on the Map option and select Save Map. Then, use Eraser in the toolbar to remove the left and right pulmonary veins.\nClick on the image, select Area Measurement and measure the area of the pulmonary vein vestibule.\nSubscription Required.
