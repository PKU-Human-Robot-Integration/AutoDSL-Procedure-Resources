    "Male mice (5 mice per cage) were housed at a temperature of 21 ± 1°C and a humidity of 55 ± 10% under controlled laboratory conditions and maintained with food and water ad libitum. Mice were tested during the light phase of a 12-h light cycle (lights on at 6:00 am and off at 6:00 pm).AnesthesiaSix-week-old Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice, weighing 25-35 g, were purchased from Koatec Co. (Pyeongtaek, Korea). After arrival, the mice were housed in an animal facility for 7 days for acclimatization.The mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of anesthesia solution (8.5 ml·kg−1; Recipe 2). All procedures for the sweat assay were terminated within 1 h before the mice woke up.The mice were placed on a 37°C-heating pad in an empty cage for 5 min without any stimulus (e.g., noise and light) for stabilization of anesthesia.The anesthetized mice were carefully transported into a mouse restrainer (Equipment 7) and covered using a screw-lid.Drug administrationThe drug solutions (pilocarpine, glycopyrrolate, BoNT/A, myricetin, and M-LNP, see the Recipes section) were prepared and warmed to 37°C immediately before administration. If needed, the drug solutions were sterilized by passing through a 0.2-μm syringe filter before use.Administration of the drug solution after stabilization of anesthesiaApplication on hind footpad skin (Figure 1A)The drug solution was pipetted onto the hind footpad skin. Precautions were taken not to over-apply the solution.A mouse-containing restrainer was placed on the heating pad for 30 min to allow sufficient time for absorption and action of the agents.Subcutaneous injection (Figure 1B)A needle-equipped syringe was loaded with drug solution. Care was taken not to inject the drug solution over 20 µl to avoid excessive bulging of the skin.To remove the air in the syringe column, the piston was pressed while keeping the syringe with the needle-side up.",
    "The needle was slowly inserted into the right hind footpad skin as close to the surface as possible, while maintaining an almost parallel angle between the needle and the skin surface to avoid subcutaneous structural damage and bleeding. Thin needles (17 gauge) were used to minimize skin damage, and fresh needles were used every time to prevent infection.The drug solution was injected and the needle was removed. If saliva secretion stimulants such as pilocarpine hydrochloride were used, saliva overflow was eliminated using a wipe to prevent suffocation.Any overflow was wiped off.The mouse-containing restrainer was placed down on the heating pad for 10 min to allow sufficient time for action of the agents.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4047/bioprotoc-11-11-4047-g001.jpgFigure 1. Administration of the drugs in the sweat assay after anesthesia. A. Procedures for the application of the drug solutions on the skin of the right hind footpads of mice. B. Procedures for the subcutaneous injection of the drug solutions into the right hind footpads of mice.Iodine-starch test (Figure 2)After administration of the drugs (pilocarpine, glycopyrrolate, BoNT/A, myricetin, and M-LNP), the remainder of the solution was wiped off the footpad skin, the skin washed with warm PBS, and the liquid wiped off again.Using a paintbrush, the iodine solution was applied to both the left and right hind footpads and allowed to dry for 1 min. The paintbrush used was wider than the horizontal width of the hind footpads, which enabled painting of enough iodine solution at once. Further, the paintbrush was soaked in iodine solution before use to avoid the formation of iodine crystals resulting from ethanol-drying. To avoid the formation of spots with iodine crystals, which can influence the values of the resulting sweating area %, application was done only once.",
    "To block sweat evaporation from the skin surface, a coat of starch-oil solution was applied once on the footpad skin by brushing at 37°C. A different paintbrush was used for this step. To avoid starch aggregation during the application, the starch solution was stirred.Immediately after coating with the starch solution, photographs of the hind footpad were acquired under fixed conditions of distance, magnification, and exposure. Atmospheric exposure of the starch-covered hind footpads for longer than 5 min can affect the unwanted color change due to moisture; thus, we suggest 5 min as the time limit for determining the sweating area (%).Description of the test: The iodine-in-ethanol solution was first applied over the footpad skin and the ethanol was then evaporated for 1 min. Next, the starch-in-oil solution was applied over the footpad skin covered with iodine. The sweat is captured between the skin and the oil layer since the moisture cannot diffuse out through the hydrophobic oil layer. In turn, dissolution into the captured sweat makes the brownish iodine react with the starch and turns a blue-black color as a result of ionization to polyiodide ions. In addition, the concentrations of starch and iodine in the starch solution and iodine solution, respectively, are high enough to induce the blue-black color change if the mice sweat.Note: The number of solution applications, once each, is more important than the volume. Therefore, the color can be changed to blue-black by each serial application of the iodine and starch solutions only once, without any risk of a lack of color change. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4047/bioprotoc-11-11-4047-g002.jpgFigure 2.
