Intracerebroventricular injection\n(A) Detailed picture of the injection set-up, it includes: the injection pipette (1), the silicon tube (2), the 18G needle (3), the 10 mL syringe (4), the stereotaxic arm (5), the P20 pipette (6), the container filled with ice and a Petri dish to put the pup in (7) and the digital display console (8).\n(B) P0 mouse pup being injected with a mix of viral solution and blue dye.\n(C) Injection site is located at ⅖ on the imaginary line from the eye to lambda indicated by the red triangle.\n(D) Picture of previously injected pup. By transparency you should be able to see the shape of the ventricle.\nMake a glass pipette:\nTake a 3.5″ Drummond glass pipette (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A item 1) and pull using a Narishige puller (PC-100).\nCut the tip of the pipette to a diameter that ranges from 25 to 40 μm.\nNote: We only keep pipettes with a sharp opening and discard all the others (no need to polish the opening).\nPrepare the injection system:\nConnect the pipette to a silicon tube (Tygon R-3603) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A item 2) that is connected to a 18G needle (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A item 3).\nConnect the needle to a 10 mL syringe (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A item 4).\nClean the pipette with alcohol and rinse thoroughly with sterile water or sterile PBS. Let it dry.\nAttach the system to a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Model 940) that will allow precise control of the injection depth (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A item 5).",
    "Dilute the viral solution with 0.05% trypan blue (T8154 Sigma) to verify the injection site (see step 10, Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B, 1C, and 1D).\nWithdraw 2 μL of this colored solution using a P20 pipette (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A item 6). Place this solution on parafilm and aspirate it.\nAnesthetize a newborn (P0.5-P1) pup on ice for 3–5 min (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A item 7).\nGently hold the head of the animal between two fingers (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). The injection site is approximately at two fifths of the imaginary line between lambda and the eye4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C and for more information see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] in Kim et al.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nPlace above the location site:\nPlace the pipette above the injection site.\nLower until it reaches the skin. Keep lowering the glass pipette and until a small deformation of the skull under this pressure is noticed.\nNote: When piercing through the skull, its surface bounces back.\nAt this step, zero the z-axis reference on the digital display console (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A item 8).\nDescend to a depth of 400 μm (150 μm/s) and inject the viral solution (500 nL/s, this step should take roughly 10 s in total).\nNote: You should see the ventricle filling up at this point (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D). Troubleshooting 1\nCheck the injection position by positioning the head of the pup against a source of light. Look through and you should see a “banana shape” labeling (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nWarm up the pup on a heating pad (set to 37°C) for 2 min after injecting before placing it back in the litter. Rinse the pipette with sterile PBS between each injection.",
    "Critical: To be effective, this injection needs to be performed a few hours after birth (typically works fine in pups less than 24 hours old). The longer you wait the more difficult the injection will be (mainly because of the skin transparency).\nPreparation for cranial window surgery\nTiming: 45 min\nIn this section, we will outline all the essential steps for preparing and executing a successful, high-quality cranial window surgery.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6],7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]\nPreferably, choose the more robust animal in the litter (weight is a good indicator).\nIt’s important to wait a minimum of 5 days between the intracerebroventricular and the surgery to induce a strong and stable expression of GCAMP (see discussion).\nInject subcutaneously the analgesic (buprenorphine 0.05 mg/kg)8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] at the back of the neck and keep the pup on a heating pad for 30 min. Troubleshooting 2.\nPrepare your setup (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3164-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Cranial window implantation setup\nTools required for the cranial window surgery: heat pad (1), isoflurane mask (2), vacuum pump (3), sealed Erlenmeyer (4), thin GELoader pipette (5), flexible silicon tube (6), spring scissors (7) and (8), fine forceps (9), straight forceps Dumont (10) and (11), angled fine forceps (12), titanium headplate (13), cannula (14), stick of liquid glue (15), syringe (16), dental cement kit and brush (17, 18, 19, 20), Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) (21), cotton swabs (22), Super-Bond (23), Parafilm piece (24), 0.3 mL insulin syringe (25), 26G needle (26), headpost (27) and Kwik-Sil (28).\nEnsure the entire setup is disinfected with alcohol.\nCover the heating pad (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] item 1) and the platform (Stoelting ref #51625) with a sterile diaper.",
    "Turn the heating pad on, with the heat stabilized at 37°. Fix the rectal probe with a tape, and place it underneath the pup. Fix the isoflurane mask (Minerve veterinary induction anesthesia machine, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] item 2) on the pad.\nConnect a vacuum pump (WPI ref. 801963; Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] item 3) to a 500-mL sealed Erlenmeyer with a flexible silicon tube for aspiration (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] item 4). Fix a thin pipette (0.5–20 μL Eppendorf GELoader; Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] item 5 and 6) at the end of the tube.\nSterilize your scissors (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] items 7 and 8) and tweezers (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] items 9, 10, 11 and 12) in a hot bead sterilizer (Fine Science Tools sterilizer, at 240°C during 20 s).\nRinse the headplate (Luigs and Neumann headpost small and round P6 + adapter plate type 1) and the cannula (custom made by MicroGroup, Gauge 11.5, welded. Outside Diameter: 0,1150 inches; Inside diameter: 0,0945 inches; Length: 0,060 inches) with ethanol to remove any impurities (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], yellow circle, items 13 and 14).\nNote: A 3 mm glass window (Warner Instrument CS-3R-1) was previously glued (Norland Optical Adhesive 81) to one side of the cannula (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] item 14) and cured through UV light.",
    "On the side, set a sterile field and put the previously cleaned and sterilized tools (all listed in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]), add a stick of liquid glue (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] item 15), a fine-tip transfer pipette (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] item 16), items for dental cement preparation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] items 17, 18, 19 and 20), saline solution (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] item 21), cotton swabs (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] item 22), the Super-Bond (Sun Medical Super-Bond C&B, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] item 23), a parafilm piece (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] item 24), a needle (BD Microfine insulin syringe, 30 G, 0.3 mL, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] item 25), a 26G needle with its syringe (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] item 26), the headplate holder (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] item 27), and the Kwik-Sil syringe (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] item 28).\nCranial window surgery\nTiming: 1.5 h\nIn this section, we will review all the necessary steps involved during the cranial window surgery that are required to grant optical access to the hippocampus.\nInduce the pup with isoflurane (3% in a 90% O2 / 10% air mix at a rate of 0.4 L/min) in an anesthetic chamber. This step typically lasts 5 min.\nTransfer the pup on the heating pad (37°C) and place its nose in the mask where the isoflurane exits (maintained between 0.5%‒1.5% in a 90% O2 / 10% air mix during the procedure. With this O2 and air mixture concentration, we achieved a consistently stable state of anesthesia.). Troubleshooting 3.\nGently apply the povidone-iodine antiseptic (betadine) on the skin using a cotton swab.\nMake a small incision at the midline between the eyes using curved scissors. The scalp should be taken off above the cerebral hemispheres until lambda has been reached.",
    "Remove the connective tissues with a cotton swab soaked with saline solution. At the same time, use the cotton swab to gently push away the skin on the side.\nNote: During this step, if the exposed area appears to be too small, extend it, especially on the side of the future cortectomy.\nTo dry out the surface of the skull, apply a tiny amount of Super-Bond onto the skull with a brush, spread and push the liquid on the sides. Wait for 20 s, and wipe the surface with cotton swabs soaked with saline solution.\nTo increase adherence, gently scratch the skull with a thin needle, in a grid pattern. Remove the impurities with a cotton swab soaked with saline solution and dry again.\nFix the headplate onto the skull with glue.\nNote: The inner diameter of the headplate should follow the medial sinus and lambda. Troubleshooting 4\nFollowing up, apply a sufficient quantity of dental cement onto the skull surface. This will both anchor, and reinforce the overall strength of the headplate onto the skull.\nNote: Make sure the cement only touches the skull, not the skin nor the hair. If so, the fixation will be unstable and movement artifacts will be observed during imaging.\nStart the vacuum pump and cut the tip of the pipette with the curved scissors.\nUsing a small needle (BD Microfine insulin syringe, 30 G, 0.3 mL), pierce the skull following the edges of the headplate. Eventually the skull can be lifted up and removed with a pair of forceps.\nNote: To prevent any damages to the cortex, the skull should be lifted up in one complete piece. If the skull is successfully removed, blood vessels should be visible and no skull pieces should exceed the edges.",
    "With a hooked needle, gently scratch the surface of the pia mater. Continue to rinse and aspirate with saline. Gently pinch and remove the rest of the meninges using thin forceps.\nCritical: Make sure that no meninges are left on the edges; otherwise, they will prevent a correct flow of aspiration during the upcoming steps.\nRemove the cortex and expose the fibers from the corpus callosum (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3164-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Schematic of the principal steps for cranial window surgery\n(A) Coronal slice exposing the future location of the window indicated by the dotted circle.\n(B) Steps to follow until the fibers are reached: 1. Remove the skull 2. Remove the cortex starting from a small area 3. Dig deeper until the fibers are reached on the small area. Once there, expand the area by pushing the tip forward and up. 4. With the same movement, increasingly expose the fibers.\n(C) Top view of the cortex removal: 1. When fibers are reached, follow their directions while removing the cortex. 2. Before cannula implantation, the fibers should be visible, the surface flat and no bleedings left. 3. Implant the cannula and seal with dental cement if there is some space left between the cannula and the headplate.",
    "(D) Instructions for attaching the cannula to the forceps. 1. Secure the forceps firmly onto the stereotaxic frame, ensuring it is aligned vertically, and tighten the screw marked by the red arrow. 2. Grasp the end of the forceps and approach the cannula with the glass facing downward. 3. Maintain pressure and gently insert the ends of the forceps until they make contact with the glass at the base of the cannula. 4. Release the pressure on the forceps; the cannula will remain in position due to the tension exerted by the forceps against the cannula walls.\nStart to remove several layers of the cortex on a small area with the tip (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A, B1 and B2).\nContinuously adjust the focus on the aspirated area. Continue to remove the cortex until the fibers of the corpus callosum are reached (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B3 and B4).\nNote: The fibers are distinguished by their stringy, elongated texture compared to the upper layers (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). An adjustment of the light source onto the surface should bring them out.\nOnce the fibers are well exposed, start vacuuming the remaining part of the cortex, by placing the aspiration tip on the lowest layer of cortex, right above the fibers.\nNote: Aspirate the cortex in the same direction as the fibers in order to limit the damages to the fibers (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C1 and C2).\nTo finalize this step, make sure that the field of view exposing the fibers is as flat as possible. Continue rinsing until the bleeding stops.\nNext, attach the forceps to the stereotaxic frame, so that it's secured, and further pinch the clamp ends in order to insert the cannula (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nUsing the pressure ends of the forceps to keep the cannula in place, move the cannula above the cortectomy (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).",
    "To ensure a perfect fit of the cannula for craniotomy, initiate an initial descent with the cannula, stopping just after it passes the skull level, and then return upward.\nNote: It’s important to ensure that the cannula is parallel to the surface of the brain.\nNote: This step could trigger some bleeding during the final descent of the cannula.\nContinuously rinse and aspirate the saline solution until the bleeding stops, and draw out the remaining saline.\nUsing a thin needle, lay a tiny droplet of transparent silicone (Kwik-Sil WPI) onto the surface of the brain.\nImmediately descend the cannula and apply slight pressure so that the droplet of silicon spreads evenly and travels along the sides of the cannula, filling the area between the cannula walls and the brain (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C3).\nCritical: To prevent the formation of air bubbles in the silicone drop, the descent of the cannula and its implantation should not exceed 20 seconds.\nCritical: The imaged structure is localized deeply within the brain, therefore, the thickness of every element crossed by the laser should be optimized, more specifically, the thickness of the Kwik-Sil layer should be minimal and the top edge of the cannula must not be deeper than the lower bound of the headplate.\nNote: The cannula should fit perfectly in the craniotomy, however, if there is some space left, fill it with Kwik-Sil.\nUse liquid glue to seal the top edge of the cannula with the headplate.\nPinch the end of the forceps and lift it up using the stereotaxic frame.\nStop the anesthesia and remove the animal from the isoflurane mask.\nInject subcutaneously saline solution/physiological serum (same volume as buprenorphine) and leave the pup on a heating pad at 37°C.",
    "Note: In neonatal mice, the anesthesia is likely to affect the brain activity;9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] therefore, we leave the mouse to rest on a heating pad for at least one hour. After that, the imaging session can be started.\n2 photon imaging in behaving pups\nTiming: 0.5-2h\nIn this section, the central focus will be to outline all the essential steps required for the concurrent recording of neuronal activity and behavior (ranging from simple recordings of animal movements to any kind of behavioral tasks) in head fixed mouse pups.\nTwo-photon microscopy and behavior recordings setup (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3164-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. 2-photon calcium imaging set-up\n(A) Custom-made saddle: The system relies on a small aluminum board (1), two optical posts (2) and (3) attached to the platform and connected by a third post (4). A C-shaped object (5) is fixated on (4) and acts as a saddle to support the animal during the recording.\n(B) P8 animal under the objective: the heat lamp (1) is directed towards the saddle which is set right under the immersion objective x16 (2), infrared cameras (3) and (4) will closely record the animal behavior.\nTurn on all necessary equipment to perform imaging experiments. This includes the laser, the fluorescent lamp, the data acquisition system, the heating lamp (adjusted to 37°C; Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B item 1), and the xyz-stage controller.\nSeparately, on a small aluminum Breadboard (Thorlabs MB1015/M, Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A item 1), fix two Thorlabs optical posts (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A items 2 and 3) using some screws and connect them with a third post (Thorlabs MS05 R/M and MSRA90; Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A item 4).\nFind a small c-shaped object (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A item 5) likely to hold the pup.\nGlue it to the metallic post and apply some medical silicon on the entire surface.",
    "Note: This custom saddle can be adapted depending on the size of the pup (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nPlace the custom saddle on the main stage, right underneath the objective (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B item 2). On each side, fix an infrared camera (Basler camera acA 1920–155 μm; Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B item 3 and 4) directed towards the saddle and finally the infrared light source (TPL VISION, SBAR-850-NL-DO).\nPrepare the pup.\nIn order to avoid any leakage during the imaging session, contour thinly the outer edges of the headplate with some Kwik-Sil. Leave it to dry for 2 min.\nPlace the head-fixed mouse on the custom “saddle”; adjust the angles of the headpost, such that the cannula is perfectly orthogonal to the objective (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nInsert some water and verify that no air bubbles are present in the cannula. If you lose the meniscus during the acquisition, see Troubleshooting 5.\nFind the surface of the hippocampus using the binocular and a fluorescent lamp. If you can’t find the surface of the brain, see Troubleshooting 6.\nStart recording animal behavior as well as CA1 multi neuron dynamics (specific details about acquisition parameters/equipment use are given in the following section).\nTwo photon imaging of spontaneous CA1 dynamics in the hippocampus.\nUse a single-beam multiphoton pulsed laser scanning system coupled to a microscope (TriM Scope II, LaVision BioTec).\nSet the Ti:sapphire excitation laser (Chameleon Ultra II, Coherent) at 920 nm.\nNote: GCaMP fluorescence is isolated using a bandpass filter (510/25). Images are acquired through a GaAsP PMT (H7422-40, Hamamatsu) using a 16X immersion objective (NIKON, NA 0.8 for a total duration of 33 min or 15000 frames).",

(step #1) Extraction of cells and their traces with Suite2p using the motion corrected movie. (step #2) Inference of neuronal activity using DeepCINAC takes as input the calcium imaging movie (left) and outputs a binary raster (right). The processing results and the data are stored in a temporary NWB file (step #1 + step #2). (step #3) Manual annotation of the behavior using the BADASS GUI, each line corresponds to one specific behavior.

The cicada logo indicates the use of the Graphic User Interface of CICADA for analysis and manual annotation.\nMotion correction.\nTo correct the possible motion artifacts occurring during the imaging session, we use custom MATLAB codes (adapted from Miri et al.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]) available at GitLab.12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]\nNote: For this step, movies need to be in tiff. format.\nNote: This step can also be performed using the Suite2p algorithm which uses .tiff movies as an input.\nIn brief, for each recording session, a subset of frames is selected as a reference and the shifts in the x and y axes are corrected with a rigid and / or non-rigid method.\nSegmentation (cell detection and variation of fluorescence extraction).\nInstall Suite2p13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13] following the instructions.14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]",
    "Before running the algorithm, adapt the values to the current experimental values. The most important parameters to fine tune are the sampling rate ‘fs’ at 8, the Gaussian smoothing for registration ‘smooth_sigma’ to 1.15, ‘tau’ to 1.25, and the average diameter in pixels of ROIs in the recordings ‘diameter’ to 10.\nRun the algorithm. The output will be used in the next steps.\nNote: Suite2p can perform a non-rigid motion correction simultaneously, if ‘reg_tiff’ and ‘non_rigid’ are set to 1.\nNeuronal activity inference (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5], Step #2).\nNeuronal activity extraction2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]\nNote: Numerous algorithms have been developed to infer neuronal activity13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13],15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15],16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16],17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17] from calcium fluorescence signals. However, these algorithms rely on having several reference points established through simultaneous targeted patch clamp recordings and 2-photon calcium recordings3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3],18[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18],19[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19] of different cell types. Unfortunately, such data is unavailable when it comes to the developing hippocampus. As a result, we opted not to infer the spiking activity of every recorded neuron within our field of view. Instead, we assumed that neurons were active from the onset to the peak of any given calcium transient (depicted in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5], blue and red stripes on calcium transient). Consequently, we developed DeepCINAC,2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] an innovative toolbox using a deep learning-based approach. This toolbox is designed to infer neuronal activity exclusively based on calcium imaging recordings (i.e., movies). The performance of this toolbox is impressive not only on developing hippocampus datasets, but also on recordings from other cortical areas, such as the barrel cortex.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] It particularly excels in cases involving overlapping co-active cells, a common occurrence in densely packed layers like the CA1 pyramidal layer. Furthermore, DeepCINAC2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] has been trained to predict interneuron activity without any specific labeling to identify interneurons.",
    "Since the algorithm is already published and available online, we will not detail how to infer activity with DeepCINAC; rather we invite you to follow the tutorial online on the GitLab page20[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20] in demos.\nThe code outputs a binary array with the activity of all cells as a function of time, with 1 if the cell is active at the current frame, 0 otherwise. (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] Step# 2).\nNote: When used locally, the code needs to access the GPU to perform the prediction of activity, therefore, follow the instructions in the “inferring neuronal activity” section on the GitLab page.20[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]\nThe activity can also be predicted online on Google Colab.\nCritical: At the end of this step, it’s important to create a temporary Neurodata Without Borders21[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21],22[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22] (NWB) file (see below) to move to the next steps. The activity can also be predicted online on Google Colab.\nBehavioral annotation.\nCICADA and BADASS GUI.\nNote: The goal of our experiment is to link neuronal activity (Steps #1 and #2) with pups' behavior. To do so, we developed a graphical user interface (GUI) named CICADA (Calcium Imaging Complete Automated Data Analysis). This GUI accepts as inputs any NWB file to perform any kind of analysis. One example is BADASS (Behavioral Analysis of Data And Some Surprises) analysis that we use to manually annotate animal behavior during our imaging session (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] Step #3). To install and run it, refer to the instructions and the video on the GitLab repository.23[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]",
    "Note: NWB formatting (not specific to this experiment): We decided to use NWB (Neurodata Without Border, Kavli Foundation) files as a data standard to share and store our data (including metadata). NWB files are similar to a container storing collections of data, including the raw data and the results of the preprocessing steps above. (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] Step #1+Step #2). These datasets are stored with the metadata describing each experimental condition or preprocessing parameters. Regardless of their content, for example two-photon imaging data or extracellular recordings data, NWB files are organized following a similar structure.21[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21],22[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]\nFinal NWB file and analysis.\nFinal NWB file.\nThe final NWB gathers the content of the temporary version, namely the segmentation and the activity predictions (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] step #1, step #2) and the manual annotation performed in BADASS GUI (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] step #3) as well as the raw data. This final version is used as the input to CICADA GUI to perform analyses (see below).\nData analysis in CICADA.\nTo link pups’ behavior to neuronal activity, analyses such as Peri Movement Time Histogram (PMTH) or displaying the raster with the behavior epochs are performed on the final NWB. The outputs of such analyses are displayed on Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] step #4.\n: Note This entire step-by-step analysis pipeline is specific to our data which includes two photon calcium imaging and behavioral recordings. However, CICADA can be extended to other new avenues of analyses, of which can be implemented through CICADA following the template in.23[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]"
