    "All surgical and animal handling procedures were performed as approved under the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council) and the Guidelines of the Indiana University School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Preparing the Animal and Performing the T10 Spinal Laminectomy\nSterilize the surgical instruments and metal spine stabilizer in an autoclave. Clean the surgical operating table. Warm a heating pad to 37 °C. Place the heating pad on the operating table and cover it with sterile surgical drapes. Use sterile technique throughout the operation.\nUse female young adult C57/6J mice at 10 weeks old for this study. Anesthetize each animal with an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of a ketamine (87.7 mg/kg) and xylazine (12.3 mg/kg) mixture. Confirm complete anesthesia by eliciting no response to a paw pinch-induced nociception stimulation.\nSubcutaneously administer buprenorphine (0.01-0.05 mg/kg), an analgesic agent, and carprofen (5 mg/kg), a non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug.\nShave the hair over the thoracolumbar spine using an electric clipper. Scrub the skin with betadine solution and 70% alcohol wipes.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to the corneas to protect the eyes from drying during surgery.\nWith a scalpel, make a 1.5 cm midline skin incision on the back of the animal to expose the 9th to 11th thoracic vertebral laminae. Push the subcutaneous adipose tissue rostrally. Dissect the paraspinal muscles away from spinous processes and laminae, toward the lateral facets on each side.\nPosition the mouse on the U-shaped trough of the stabilizer (Figure 2A and 2B). Bilaterally clamp the stainless steel arms beneath the exposed facets of the T10 vertebra (Figure 4A) and tighten using the thumb screws attached to the arms (Figure 2A).",
    "Remove the T10 spinous process and lamina (laminectomy) using a micro-rongeur that exposes the dura mater overlying the spinal cord (Figure 4B).\n2. Performing the T10 Contusion Injury Using the LISA Impactor\nTurn the knob of the pressure regulator on the nitrogen tank to set the compressed nitrogen to 20 PSI or 138 kPa (Figure 1A) for this study.\n\tNOTE: The pressure is adjustable from 10-120 PSI. A higher pressure will result in a higher-velocity impact. The SCI device tip with a diameter of 1.2 mm is designed for mice, and the tip with a diameter of 2.2 mm is designed for rats. When changing from mice to rats, the larger-diameter tip can be formed by adding a ring to the metal tip (id 1.2 mm/od 2.2 mm). We used the 1.2 mm tip in this mice SCI study. Sterilize the SCI tip before use.\nTurn on the computer to start the software. Push Button 1 (Figure 1B) to activate the impactor tip into a fully-extended position (Figure 3A-1).\n\tNOTE: The function of Button 1 is to manually activate or deactivate the pneumatic cylinder.\nPlace the U-shaped container with the mouse onto the stage (Figure 2B). Fix the stage in place by tightening the thumb screws of the mount (Figure 2B).\nUnder the \"SET ZERO LEVEL\" zone (green), set the zero level, with a laser sensor measuring the distance to the fully-extended plunger tip, by clicking the \"START READING\" button (Figure 3A). The distance will be shown in the \"Range\" parameter in this zone (Figure 3A). Click the \"SET ZERO\" button (Figure 3A), and a number in mm will appear in the \"Zero\" parameter box (e.g., 8.951 mm, shown in Figure 3A).",
    "Push Button 1 (Figure 1B) to withdraw the impactor tip (Figure 3B-1, indicated by an upper arrow) and unlock fastening Screw 1 (Figure 2B). Pull the screw to the right position (Figure 3B-1, indicated by a lateral arrow) to move the tip away from the laser beam path and turn the screw 90° clockwise to lock the screw.\nMove the stage by adjusting the frontal and lateral micro-drivers (Figure 1C) to aim the laser beam onto the center of the exposed dorsal spinal cord. After the injury location is targeted, measure the tissue distance by clicking the \"START READING\" button under the \"SET INJURY LEVEL\" zone (blue) (Figure 3B and 3B-1).\nSlowly adjust the distance between the sensor and the spinal cord via the vertical micro-driver (Figure 1C) to reach the desired displacement parameter (e.g., 0.500 mm, shown in the \"Injury\" parameter box) in the \"SET INJURY LEVEL\" zone (blue) (Figure 3B).\nWhen the desired injury displacement is reached, record the tissue distance (e.g., 8.451 mm, shown in the \"Range\" parameter box) (Figure 3B). Define the desired displacement (Injury) = tip distance (Zero) - tissue distance (Range) (Figure 3B). When the desired injury (e.g., 0.500 mm tissue displacement) is reached (Figure 3B), click the \"SET INJURY\" button under the \"SET INJURY LEVEL\" zone to set the injury.\nTurn Screw 1 90° counterclockwise to unlock the screw, push the impact tip back into the laser beam trajectory (Figure 3C-1, direction indicated by an arrow), and lock Screw 1 by turning it 90° clockwise.\nClick the Run button under the red \"RUN EXPERIMENT\" zone (Figure 3C) to execute the impact. The parameter boxes under this zone will show the injury time (s), the force (mV), the velocity (m/s), and the injury displacement (mm) (Figure 3C).",
    "After all injury data are recorded and saved, remove the U-shaped trough with the mouse from the stage. Visually confirm the spinal cord injury under a surgical microscope (Figure 4C).\nSuture the paravertebral muscles, superficial fascia, and skin using continuous suture with 3-0 silk (Henry Schein, 776-SK).\nInject the animal with 1 mL of 0.9% saline subcutaneously for hydration and place it onto a temperature-controlled pad until full consciousness has been regained. Place the mouse into a cage with accessible food and water.\nFor post-operative care, manually express the bladder until spontaneous bladder voiding returns.  For analgesia, inject Buprenorphine (0.05-2.0 mg/kg, SQ) 8-12 h/day for 2 days. If urinary bladder infection occurs, inject Baytril (SQ, 5-10 mg/kg in 0.1 mL, 1 dose daily) for 7-10 days. If regional/systemic infection occurs, inject Gentamycin (SQ, 5-8 mg/kg, diluted in 1 mL sterile saline, every 8-12 h) for 4 days.\nRemove the suture threads at 14 days post-SCI. \nOn the 42th day post injury, mice will be sacrificed by perfusion. After appropriate anesthesia as 1.2, they will be perfused with 30 ml (0.01M) phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and 30 ml 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.01 M PBS. One centimeter of the spinal cord including the lesion epicenter will be collected and processed for sectioning and histological analysis."
