    "ETHICS STATEMENT:\nAll animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE.\n1. Induction of Experimental Autoimmune Myocarditis\nPrepare the peptide solution by dissolving Myhc-α 334-352 in 1x phosphate-buffered saline to a final concentration of 2 mg/1.5 ml.\nPrepare the pertussis toxin (PT) by adding 1 ml of sterile 1x PBS to a vial containing 50 μg of lyophilized PT to obtain a stock concentration of 50 ng/μl. Take 20 μl of the stock into a sterile 1.5 ml tube and add 980 μl of sterile 1x PBS to obtain a working concentration of 1 ng/μl.\nPrepare complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) by adding 40 mg of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (MTB) extract to 10 ml of CFA to obtain a final concentration of 5 mg/ml.\nPrepare the peptide-CFA emulsion. NOTE: For EAM induction, the peptide-CFA emulsion was administered in 150 μl containing 100 µg of Myhc-α 334-352 per animal. For example, to immunize ten mice use 1.5 ml of peptide-CFA emulsion containing 1 mg of Myhc-α 334-352.\n\t\nTo prepare 1.5 ml of emulsion, aliquot 750 μl of Myhc-α 334-352 peptide solution in one 1.5 ml tube, and CFA supplemented with MTB into another 1.5 ml tube. Using a 3 ml luer-lok syringe, draw the peptide solution first, followed by the CFA/MTB extract.\nAttach the syringe to a 3-way stopcock and connect the other outlet of the stopcock to an empty 3 ml syringe. Adjust the patency of the stopcock so the peptide-CFA mixture flows from one syringe to the other with reasonably good resistance.",
    "Mix by pushing the contents from one syringe to the other repeatedly for ~1 min and then place the entire assembly on ice for ~3 min. Repeat this procedure a minimum of 10x.\nDetermine the consistency of the emulsion by carefully placing a tiny droplet on still water in a 100 ml glass beaker. The droplet is not expected to disperse in water. If it does, continue mixing until the desired consistency is achieved.\nTransfer the contents of emulsion from 3 ml syringes into 1 ml luer-lok syringes by replacing one of the two 3-ml syringes attached to the stopcock with the 1-ml syringe, and attach a 27 ½ G needle to the 1 ml syringe.\nInject 150 µl of the peptide-CFA emulsion in split doses subcutaneously in the two inguinal regions of six-to-eight-week-old female A/J mice (~75 µl each).\nAdminister 100 μl of PT suspension (100 ng) intraperitoneally to each animal on day 0 and day 2 postimmunization.\nRepeat the immunization procedure on day 7 by administering 150 µl of peptide-CFA emulsion in split doses subcutaneously into either side of the sternum (~75 µl each). Prepare this emulsion fresh as above. Then, on day 21, subject the animals to MRM imaging, see step 3.\n2. Animal Handling\nPlace each mouse in an anesthetic induction chamber containing 2% isoflurane-air mixture with a heating pad placed underneath to maintain warmth, and transfer the animal to a specially designed animal holder (Figure 1).\nImmobilize the animal in the prone position on the animal holder so its snout fits into the nose cone to maintain anesthesia (Figure 1). Secure the head of the mouse with a bite-bar attached to the front teeth of the mouse.",
    "Turn on the air blow heater with its outlet hose inserted in the scanner’s vertical bore to maintain the animal’s body temperature during the experiment.\nMaintain anesthesia at 0.5 to 2% isoflurane with a flow rate of 2 ml/min during the entire imaging session. Confirm anesthesia using the toe pinch method, no movement expected.\nSet up a pneumatic pillow sensor, mouse tail/ankle fiber optic pulse oximetry sensor, and rectal temperature probe to monitor respiration, heart rate and body temperature, respectively (Figure 1). Note: Cardiac gating is performed through Pulse Oximetry, which allows noninvasive monitoring of arterial blood oxygen saturation. The pulse oximetry sensor should be attached to the left ankle, and the foot should be secured with a thread loop and taped to maintain the ankle in the sensor. MRM imaging is achieved by gating the respiration and cardiac signals without the use of any contrast agents.\n3. Image Acquisition\nAfter preparing the animal (Figure 1), place the mouse in the center of the MRM scanner with the heart positioned in the center of the field of view (FOV), where magnetic field homogeneity is maximum. NOTE: A wide-bore (89 mm) 9.4 T vertical-bore magnet equipped with triple axis gradients of 100 G/cm and a 4 cm radio-frequency (RF) imaging coil is to be used to obtain high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) images. Note: Be sure to non-magnetic supplies when using an MRI scanner.",
    "Run the imaging interface and select “New Study” from the “Study Options” menu. Type “mtune” at the command bar and run it to pull up the “Tune GUI”. Then select “Start Probe Tune” and click on “Autoscale” button. The Tune GUI will change to show the RFsignal. Use the remote tune/match knobs at the end of the coil to tune the RF coil to the proton resonance frequency (400 MHz). On the “Start” tab go to the “Prescan” page to run the frequency and power calibration by clicking on the related buttons. Hit the XYZ (quick) button on the ‘Shim” tab of “Study’ tab to pull up the shimming page. Go to the shim page, select all of the iterations, and hit the shim button to perform auto shimming.\nSelect a scout sequence from the “Study” tab of the imaging interface to localize the mouse heart. On the “Acquire” tab change the FOV to 35 mm2 and keep the machine’s default settings. Click Start to run the sequence; adjust the position of the animal holder if the heart is not in the center of FOV, retune the RF coil and obtain the scout images again.\nClick the “GEMS” sequence button on the “Study” tab then enter the acquisition parameters on the corresponding “Acquire” tab to obtain two orthogonal planes along the short axis and long axis of the heart20,21. NOTE: Typical acquisition parameters for a gradient-echo scan are: slice thickness, 1 mm; repetition time (TR), 200 msec; echo time (TE), 2.67 msec (minimum); flip angle, 25°; inplane matrix size, 128 x 128; FOV, 22 mm2; number of acquisitions, 4; and an approximate acquisition time of 1 min and 30 sec.",
    "On the “Adv” tab select the “CINE” sequence to collect the pulse oximetry-gated short-axis cine MR images in order to measure the LV anatomic and functional parameters. Adjust the position and angle of the imaging slices based on the long axis view of the heart by mouse hovering and dragging. Enter the following imaging parameters on the “Acquire” tab to obtain the gradient echo cine sequence: TR, 500 msec; TE, 5 msec; FOV, 22 mm2; acquisition matrix, 256 x 256; slice thickness, 1 mm; number of acquisitions, 8; number of frames, 6; and an acquisition time of ~17 min. Click start to begin the acquisition.\nConvert the acquired images to DICOM format using the “I/O” tab of the imaging software and transfer the corresponding files to the data center for processing.\nAt the end of imaging procedure, allow the mice to recover from anesthesia within the filter-top cages. Do not leave the mice unattended until they regain sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency and keep them for further studies as needed.\n4. Data Analysis of Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Microscopy Imaging\nUse Segment software to analyze the anatomic and functional parameters of the LV19. By loading the DICOM format cine images into the software using the “Open Image File(s)” submenu of the “File” menu. On the GUI select ‘MRGE’ as the imaging technique, ‘Cine’ as the image type and ‘short-axis mid-ventricular’ as the image view plane.\nSpecify the time frames to be used for end-diastole and end-systole through the “Set Current Timeframe to End Diastole” and “Set Current Timeframe to End Systole” submenus of the “Edit” menu respectively.",
    "First click the “LV” command button and then the “ENDO” and “EPI” command buttons on the bottom-right panel to manually draw the left ventricle endocardium and epicardium respectively. Remove the papillary muscles by hitting the corresponding command button in order to increase the accuracy of the calculations.\nRead the quantified LV parameters such as diastolic volume, systolic volume, stroke volume, and ejection fraction on the top-right panel. Click the “Misc” command button and then the “Measurement Caliper” command button to measure the LV parameters such as wall thickness, and ventricular diameter22.\nClick the “Save Both Image Stacks and Segmentation” submenu of the “File” menu to save the images, including the segmentations, in ‘.mat’ format to reprocess the images as needed.\nSubscription Required.
