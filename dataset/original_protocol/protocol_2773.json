Remove the plasmids from the -20\n      C and thaw for an hour at 18–25 C prior to transformation. Prior to use,\n      spin briefly to transfer the DNA to the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube\n      and set aside.\n    \n        If plasmids were not aliquoted ahead of time, aliquot them into\n        pre-labeled microcentrifuge tubes. You will need 300 ng of plasmid per\n        transformation at a concentration of 50 ng/μL or higher. Once aliquoted,\n        spin briefly to move the DNA to the bottom of the tubes and set aside.\n      \n        Adequately sterilize the laminar flow hood prior to beginning work.\n        \n            Perform 15 min of UV irradiation with the sash closed, followed by\n            15 min of air circulation with the sash open, though the specifics\n            will depend on the model available to the experimenter.\n          \n            Spray down the working surface of the laminar flow hood with 70%\n            isopropanol or ethanol.\n          \n            Wipe down all required equipment (pipettes, pipetteman) with 70%\n            isopropanol or ethanol prior to moving them into the hood.\n          \n        Take the healthy growing OD750 0.8–1.2 range\n        A. platensis from the lighted incubator and move it into the\n        laminar flow hood.\n      \n        Calculate the volume of growing A. platensis required for the\n        number of transformations being performed.

It\n        is okay if some supernatant remains. A. platensis forms a loose\n        pellet, and it is more important to not lose cells.\n      \n        Add an equivalent volume (ex. 10 mL of 1×SOT to a pellet formed from\n        10 mL of A. platensis culture) of 18–25 C 1×SOT to the\n        A. platensis pellet.\n      \nResuspend the pellet by gently inverting the tube.\n        Centrifuge the cells at 1,600 × g for 5 min at 18–25 C. Carefully\n        aspirate the supernatant, taking care to not disturb the pellet.\n      \n        Use the following formula to calculate the 1×SOT volume for\n        resuspension:\n      \n30\nμ\nL\n∗\n[\nn\nu\nm\nb\ne\nr\no\nf\nt\nr\na\nn\ns\nf\no\nr\nm\na\nt\ni\no\nn\ns\n+\n1\nn\ne\ng\na\nt\ni\nv\ne\nc\no\nn\nt\nr\no\nl\n]\n=\nt\no\nt\na\nl\nμ\nL\nn\ne\ne\nd\ne\nd",

You have generated\n        A. platensis transformation slurry.\n      \n        Remove 30 μL of the transformation slurry from the conical and add it to\n        your first plasmid containing microcentrifuge tube by pipetting gently\n        into the bottom of the tube.\n      \n        Pipette the slurry-DNA mix up and down gently at least 10 times.

Transformation requires a minimum of 2.5 h but can be done\n        for as long as 5 with no reduction in efficiency.\n      \n        During the transformation period, set up and label the 14 mL round\n        bottom tubes.

Pipette up and\n        down 2–5 times gently to resuspend.\n      \n        Move the tubes into the shaker set to the following conditions: 30 C,\n        120 RPM orbital shaking, 50–100 μEi light, ambient CO2 (about\n        0.04%).

In addition, set out\n        the antibiotic that will be used for selection.\n      \n        Move the A. platensis transformation tubes into the hood.

For example, if you need a\n        final concentration of 100 μg/mL of an antibiotic, you will need\n        125 μg/mL in the master mix to account for dilution.\n      \nNote: the authors have found that starting\n      with a lower concentration of antibiotic and ramping it up throughout the\n      transformation process works better than immediately exposing the cells to\n      the maximum antibiotic concentration. This will require empirical\n      optimization, and it depends on the strain of A. platensis and the\n      antibiotics used.\n    \n        Add the appropriate amount of antibiotic to your 1×SOT master mix and\n        swirl to mix.\n      \nNote: the authors have successfully used\n      the following concentrations for A. platensis selection: 2.5 μg/mL\n      streptomycin (maximum concentration 5 μg/mL), 70 μg/mL kanamycin (maximum\n      concentration 100 μg/mL), 30 μg/mL gentamicin (G418) (maximum\n      concentration 60 μg/mL).\n    \n        Using an aliquoting pipettor, add 2.4 mL to each 14 mL round bottom\n        A. platensis tube.

For each passage:\n        \nRemove the tubes from the shaker.\n            Centrifuge the cells at 1,600 × g for 10 min in a tabletop\n            centrifuge.\n          \nAspirate the spent media.",
    "Add 3 mL of fresh 1×SOT with selection antibiotic.\nPlace tubes back into the shaker.\nNote: the dying and resurrection phase\n      generally follows a pattern of Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]. Days 1–5:\n      cells look healthy. Days 6–8: cells become a deep, dark green (does not\n      always happen, some cells proceed to next step directly). Days 8–18: cells\n      become yellow, brown and clumpy. Days 18–21: cells appear to disappear\n      from the tubes. The tubes will look clear, except when spun down you will\n      often see a small, white pellet. (This does not always happen, some cells\n      proceed to next step directly). Days 21–35: the strains will start to\n      emerge with a light green that will at first only be visible by pelleting.\n      This is a successful transformation. If green cells do not emerge by day\n      35, this means the strains did not successfully transform.\n    \n        Once the strains emerge, the passaging process changes from pelleting\n        the cells to aspirating the cells, diluting the A. platensis to\n        an OD750 of about 0.1 in 3 mL of media.\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2468-Fig5.jpg\n              Figure 5.

The authors typically use SapphireAmp Fast PCR Master\n        Mix (Takara, RR350B) for PCR segregation screening and KAPA HiFi (Roche,\n        KK2101) for high-fidelity PCR for amplicon sequencing."
