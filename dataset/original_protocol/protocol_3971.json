    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nLibrary preparation and library pooling\nTiming: 3–4 h\nIn this step, the prepared cDNA of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is tagmented (tagged and fragmented), indexed and amplified to become sequencing-ready libraries.\nTagmentation of PCR amplicons\nLabel a new 96-well PCR plate as TAG plate.\nFrom COV1 and COV2 plates, combine 10 μL of contents from each well to their respective wells in TAG1 plate, and mix well. This results in a total volume of 20 μL in each well of the TAG1 plate.\nTo make Tagmentation Mastermix:\nLabel a 15 mL tube as Tagmentation Mastermix.\nFollow the table below to prepare Tagmentation Mastermix.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_937_4.csv\nVortex for 30 s to mix well.\nAdd 30 μL of Tagmentation Mastermix to each well in the TAG1 plate.\nSeal and shake the TAG1 plate at 1600 rpm for 1 min.\nCentrifuge at 1000 × g for 1 min if the contents of the well are found sticking to the walls or the seal of the TAG1 plate.\nPlace on a thermal cycler and run the following program.\nChoose the preheat lid option\nSet the total volume of the reaction as 50 μL.\n55oC for 5 min\nHold at 10oC.\nPost Tagmentation Clean-up\nCentrifuge the TAG1 plate at 500 × g for 1 min.\nRemove the seal and add 10 μL of ST2 HT to each well of the TAG1 plate.\nSeal and shake at 1600rpm for 1 min.\nIncubate the plate at room temperature (22°C–25°C) for 5 min.\nCentrifuge the TAG1 plate at 500 × g for 1 min.\nRemove the seal carefully and place the plate on a magnetic stand.\nWait for 3 min/until the liquid is clear.\nRemove and discard all supernatants from the wells.\nWash the beads as follows\nRemove the plate from the magnetic stand.",
    "Add 100 μL of TWB HT to each well.\nSeal and shake at 1600 rpm for 1 min and centrifuge at 500 × g for 1 min.\nRemove the seal and place the plate on the magnetic stand. Wait for 3 min/until the liquid is clear.\nRemove and discard the supernatant from each well.\nRepeat the wash steps (step i; i-v) one more time.\nCritical: Do not discard the supernatant after the second wash, to prevent the beads from over drying.\nAmplification of tagmented amplicons\nIn a 15 mL tube, prepare Enhanced PCR Mix\nAdd 2304 μL of EPM HT (24 μL × 96 samples).\nAdd 2304 μL of Nuclease-free water (24 μL × 96 samples).\nVortex the tube to mix.\nRemove and discard the supernatant from the TAG1 plate.\nUse a 10 μL or 20 μL pipette to remove any remaining TWB HT from the TAG1 plate.\nAdd 40 μL of Enhanced PCR Mix to each well of the TAG1 plate.\nAdd 10 μL of index adapters to each well of the TAG1 plate.\nSeal and shake the plate at 1600 rpm for 1 min and centrifuge the plate at 500 × g for 1 min.\nCritical: Inspect the tubes to make sure the beads are fully resuspended and are not found at the bottom of the tubes.\nPlace on a thermal cycler and run the following PCR program\nChoose the preheat lid option and set the temperature to 100oC.\nSet the total volume of the reaction to be 50 μL.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_937_5.csv\nLibrary pooling and Clean up\nCentrifuge the TAG1 plate at 500 × g for 1 min.\nRemove the seal and place the plate on a magnetic stand and wait for 3 min/until the liquid is clear.",
    "Transfer 5 μL of library from each well into an 8-tubes strip. This results in a pooled volume of 60 μL in each tube of the 8-tubes strip.\nCritical: Discard and change tips for each column of samples while transferring.\nTransfer 55 μL of pooled library from each tube to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. This results in a total of 440 μL of pooled libraries (from 96 samples).\nAdd 396 μL of ITB to each tube (ITB volume is calculated by multiplying the total volume of the pooled libraries with 0.9 i.e., for 96 samples: 440 μL × 0.9 = 396 μL)\nVortex the tube to mix well.\nIncubate the tube at room temperature for 5 min.\nSpin briefly and place the tube on a 1.5mL tube magnetic stand and wait for 5 min.\nRemove and discard all supernatants.\nWash the beads as follows:\nAdd 1000 μL of freshly prepared 80% ethanol to the tube and wait for 30 s.\nRemove and discard the supernatant.\nRepeat the above-mentioned wash steps one more time for a total of 2 washes with 80% ethanol.\nRemove any residual ethanol left on the tube.\nAir dry the beads for 2 min.\nAdd 55 μL of Resuspension Buffer to the tube and vortex to mix.\nIncubate at room temperature for 2 min.\nSpin briefly and place the tube in the magnetic stand and wait for 2 min.\nLabel a new 1.5 mL tube as Final Pool.\nTransfer 50 μL of the supernatant into the Final Pool tube.\nPause point: The procedure can be paused here and the Final Pool tube can be stored at −20oC for 30 days.\nQuantification and Normalization of the library pool\nUsing the Qubit High Sensitivity dsDNA quantification kit (Invitrogen), quantify the library pool",
    "Dilute 1 μL of the pooled library sample in the ratio of 1:3.\nUse 2 μL of the diluted library for quantification.\nCalculate the actual concentration of the library by factoring in the dilution.\nLoad 2 μL of the pooled library (undiluted) onto a 2% agarose gel. The libraries should be observed between the size 300–400 bp.\nUsing the formula below, calculate the concentration of the library in Molar units.\nDilute the library with Resuspension Buffer to a final concentration of 4nM.\nThe formula for calculating Molarity:\n[Library Conc (ng/μL)]/ [660(g/mol) x average library size (bp)]×106= Conc. of Library (nM)\nSequencing the libraries\nTiming: ~22 h: according to MiSeq reagent kit V3 (2 × 75bp)\nThe prepared COVIDSeq libraries will be sequenced in this step using the MiSeq sequencing platform\nPreparing PhiX\nLabel a new 1.5 mL tube as PhiX Control.\nCombine 2 μL of PhiX stock library (10nM) and 3 μL of Nuclease-free water to make 4nM PhiX library\nCritical: Prepare a fresh PhiX dilution and use it within 12 hours of preparation.\nLabel a new 1.5 mL tube as PhiX-Final and add 5 μL of diluted PhiX (4nM) and 5 μL of 0.2N freshly prepared NaOH.\nVortex the tube briefly to mix. Spin and incubate the tube at room temperature for 5 min.\nAdd 990 μL of prechilled HT1 to the PhiX-Final tube resulting in 1mL of 20pM PhiX library.\nDenaturation of COVIDSeq library\nLabel a new 1.5 mL tube as Library-Final and add 5 μL of diluted library (4nM) and 5 μL of 0.2N freshly prepared NaOH.\nVortex the tube briefly to mix. Spin and incubate the tube at room temperature for 5 min.\nAdd 990 μL of pre-chilled HT1 to the tube resulting in 1mL of 20pM Final library.",
    "Critical: For instructions regarding final loading concentration and PhiX spike-in for MiSeq system, refer to the MiSeq system Denature and Dilute Libraries Guide.\nTo prepare 6pM final loading concentration library\nLabel a new 1.5mL tube as 6pM Final Library tube.\nAdd 180 μL of the 20pM library from the Library-Final tube.\nAdd 420 μL of pre-chilled HT1 and mix well.\nDiscard 6 μL of the mixture.\nAdd 6 μL of the 20pM PhiX library for 1% spike in as recommended by Illumina Inc.\nMix well with a pipette, spin briefly and place the tube on ice. The library is ready to be loaded onto the flow cell.\nCritical: The final library has to be loaded onto the flow cell within 30 minutes of preparation.\nNote: To reduce the handling time, the denaturation of the library and PhiX can be performed simultaneously.\nSequencing and expected Output\nLoad the library into the MiSeq Sequencing cartridge and initiate sequencing as per the MiSeq Sequencing guide by Illumina Inc.\nFor sequencing using MiSeq v3 2×75 cycles kit, the estimated yield is about 3.3–3.8 Gb as per Illumina Inc."
