    "Parasynchronization and infection of cellsPlate 5 x 106 cells at a concentration of 0.5 x 106 cells/ml in 10 ml Isoleucine-minus media in 15 cm dishes for 36-42 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Murine A9 fibroblasts and human NB324K kidney cells are permissive to MVMp infection and can be parasynchronized by isoleucine deprivation. Release cells into G1/S-phase by aspirating the media and adding 10 ml complete DMEM media. Simultaneously, infect with MVMp virus at an MOI of 5 (25 µl of MVMp at 1 x 106 Pfu/µl) for 16 h. Note: MVMp replication starts as cells enter into S-phase, approximately 10 h post-release into complete DMEM.Crosslinking and lysisCrosslink cells in the dish by adding 540 µl of 37% formaldehyde (final concentration of 2%). Mix well by pipetting and incubate at room temperature for 10 min on a rocker (12 oscillations/min). Quench the crosslinking reaction by adding 1.425 ml of 1 M glycine (final concentration of 0.125 M). Mix well by pipetting and incubate at room temperature for 5 min on a rocker (12 oscillations/min).Gently scrape cells using a disposable cell scraper (by moving horizontally, and vertically) and collect the cell suspension (in 12 ml media, formaldehyde and glycine) in 15 ml Falcon tubes. Centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C in a refrigerated centrifuge. Aspirate supernatant with a vacuum manifold or gently with a pipette.Wash cells with 10 ml PBS.Centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C in a refrigerated centrifuge. Aspirate supernatant.Suspend pellet in 5 ml cold 3C Lysis buffer (freshly supplemented with protease inhibitors) and incubate on ice for 10 min.Centrifuge at 3,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Aspirate the supernatant. A small white pellet should be visible at the bottom of the tube.",
    "This is mostly made up of cell nuclei. The tube can be snap frozen in liquid nitrogen at this point and stored at -80 °C. Thaw samples on ice if starting from this step.Note: Aspiration should be performed using a vacuum manifold. In its absence, pipettors may be used to carefully remove the supernatants without disturbing the cell (or nuclear) pellet.Primary restriction digestSuspend nuclei in 500 µl 1.2x NEB buffer 2.1 (60 µl of 10x stock diluted in 440 µl ddH2O) and transfer to Eppendorf tube.Add 7.5 µl of 20% SDS (final concentration of 0.3%) and place tube in a shaker at 37 °C at 900 rpm. Note: This process permeabilizes the nuclei. However, the formation of bubbles or too much SDS affects enzyme activity. Therefore, avoid forming bubbles, and ensure proper concentration of SDS solution. Incubate for 1 h at 37 °C while shaking at 900 rpm.Add 50 µl of 20% Triton X-100 (final concentration of 2%). Note: Prepare 20% Triton solution well in advance, mix and keep at 56 °C to ensure homogeneous solution. Otherwise, SDS is inadequately sequestered, leading to premature inactivation of the restriction enzyme. Incubate for 1 h at 37 °C while shaking at 900 rpm.Take out 10 µl aliquot as undigested gDNA Control. Store at -20 °C.Add 20 µl (400 U) of HindIII to remaining sample and incubate overnight at 37 °C while shaking at 900 rpm.Add 15 µl (300 U) of additional HindIII and incubate on a 37 °C shaker at 900 rpm for 4 h.Take out 10 µl aliquot as digested DNA Control. Store at -20 °C. Reverse crosslinks and determine digestion efficiency as follows:Add 2 µl of Proteinase K to the undigested DNA and digested DNA tubes, and incubate at 56 °C for 1 h.",
    "Dilute the samples to 100 µl with 90 µl ddH2O. Add 100 µl of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and vortex (setting: 10) for 10 s.Centrifuge at 13,000 x g at room temperature for 5 min. Transfer supernatant to new Eppendorf tube and add 1 ml isopropanol, and 2 µl glycogen. Vortex thoroughly for 10 s.Centrifuge at 13,000 x g at room temperature for 5 min and aspirate the supernatant. A white pellet should be visible at the bottom of the tube.Add 1 ml of 70% ethanol to the tube.Centrifuge at 13,000 x g at room temperature for 5 min and aspirate the supernatant.Resuspend pellet in 20 µl Buffer EB. Perform qPCR (using Bio-Rad SYBR Green Supermix; annealing temp: 60 °C) with 2 µl of undigested and digested gDNA using the primer sets P1-P2 (Input) and P1-P3 (undigested). Set up each qPCR reaction in triplicate.Digestion efficiency is calculated from the mean Cq value of each reaction in the digested gDNA sample using the formula:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190313/20190313030723_4852.jpgLigationAdd 40 µl of 20% SDS (final concentration of 1.6%) to the digested chromatin. Incubate for 20-25 min at 65 °C.Transfer digested nuclei to a 50 ml Falcon tube.Add 6.125 ml of 1.15x Ligation buffer (10x concentrated buffer is diluted in ddH2O).Add 375 µl of 20% Triton X-100 (final concentration of 1%).Incubate for 1 h at 37 °C while shaking gently.Add 1 µl T4 DNA Ligase (100 U total) and incubate for 4 h at room temperature.Note: Can also perform the ligation reaction at 16 °C. Add 15 µl of 20 mg/ml Proteinase K (final 300 μg).Incubate at 65 °C overnight to reverse crosslinks.Note: We also de-crosslink at 56 °C. Any temperature within this range reverses protein crosslinks without affecting the DNA.DNA purificationAdd 10 µl of 10 mg/ml RNase A (final 100 µg).",
    "Incubate for 30-45 min at 37 °C.Add 7 ml phenol-chloroform and mix by vortexing (setting: 10).Centrifuge for 5 min at 2,000 x g at 4 °C.Collect the upper aqueous phase, transfer to a new tube, add 7 ml chloroform, vortex (setting: 10).Centrifuge for 5 min at 2,000 x g at 4 °C.Transfer supernatant into a 50 ml tube, add 25 ml isopropanol and 5 µl glycogen (10 mg/ml). Mix and place at -80 °C for 1 h.Centrifuge for 20 min at 4,200 x g at room temperature.Remove supernatant and add 10 ml 70% ethanol.Centrifuge for 15 min at 4,200 x g at 4 °C.Remove supernatant and dry pellet at room temperature.Dissolve DNA pellet in 200 µl of Buffer EB.Secondary restriction digestSet up NlaIII digest on all of the 3C DNA overnight at 37 °C with 25 µl of 10x Cutsmart buffer and 15 µl of NlaIII.Inactivate NlaIII by incubating at 65 °C for 20 min.Add 1x Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamyl alcohol (250 µl); vortex, spin (10,000 x g), collect supernatant.Add 250 µl chloroform, vortex, spin (10,000 x g), collect supernatant.Add 700 µl of isopropanol and 2 µl glycogen (10 mg/ml), vortex, spin (10,000 x g to precipitate), aspirate supernatant.Add 1 ml of 70% ethanol, spin (10,000 x g), aspirate supernatant.Resuspend in 1 ml of ultrapure water.CircularizationSet up ligation reaction overnight with 1.5 ml of 10x ligase buffer, 12.5 ml of water, 1 ml resuspended NlaIII digested DNA, 1 µl T4 DNA ligase in a 50 ml Falcon tube.Add 15 ml Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamyl alcohol, vortex, spin (4,200 x g), collect supernatant.Add 15 ml Chloroform, vortex, spin (4,200 x g), collect supernatant.Add 25 ml Isopropanol and 5 µl glycogen (10 mg/ml) to precipitate DNA.
