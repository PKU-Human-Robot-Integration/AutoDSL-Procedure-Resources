  "procedures": [
    "This protocol for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing was approved by the University of Tulsa Institutional Biosafety Committee following NIH guidelines. Throughout this protocol, sterile technique was practiced. All steps of this protocol were carried out using reagents that were free of nucleases. Special care was taken to prevent RNase contamination such as cleaning gloves as well as workspaces and equipment (e.g. pipettes, exterior of glassware, etc.) with an RNase decontaminating solution.\n1. crRNA design\nFind the PAM that enables Cas9 to cut closest to the edit site.\n\t\nThe PAM site is 5'-NGG-3'.\nRemember that the PAM can be on either strand of the DNA.\nSelect 20 bp at the 5' end of the PAM as the crRNA sequence.\n\tNOTE: The actual crRNA sequence that is synthesized by commercial companies is longer than 20 bp as it has an additional generic sequence that is automatically added to the target-specific 20 bp crRNA sequence by the synthesizing company. With regard to off-target effects, recent studies have not found off-target effects of Cas9 in C. elegans36,37,38,39,40. Further, the resultant CRISPR-edited strains are outcrossed. Therefore, we are not very concerned about off-target effects of the designed crRNAs. However, online websites including http://genome.sfu.ca/crispr/ and http://crispor.tefor.net/ can be used to find and select the crRNAs with the least off-target effects38,41. crRNAs that end with a G or GG and those with greater than 50% GC-content are predicted to be more efficient19,23,42.\nOrder at least 10 nmol of the crRNA from a company (e.g. IDT, Horizon Discovery, etc.).\n\t\nOnce the lyophilized crRNA arrives, store it at -30°C until the day of the microinjection.",
    "On the day of performing the microinjection, spin the lyophilized crRNA at maximum speed (17,000 x g) for one minute and resuspend it in 5 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) to make a 8 µg/µL stock of the crRNA.\nStore the unused crRNA stock frozen at -80 °C.\n2. Repair template design\nDownload a sequence manipulation software (e.g. CLC sequence viewer, APE, Snapgene, Vector NTI, etc.). We use CLC sequence viewer version 8.0 (Qiagen) as it is user-friendly and can be downloaded for free.\nPaste the sequence of the target DNA of interest into the sequence viewer.\nThe orientation of the repair template influences the editing efficiency28. For inserting a repair sequence to the 5' end of the PAM, design a single-stranded repair template with DNA sequence from the same DNA strand on which the PAM sequence is located (protospacer strand)28. While for inserting a repair sequence to the 3' end of the PAM, design a single-stranded repair template with DNA sequence from the DNA strand that does not carry the PAM sequence (spacer strand)28.\nSelect 35 base pairs of sequence with uninterrupted homology on both sides (on the 5' and 3' end) of the edit.\nMutate or delete the PAM to prevent cutting of the repair template or the edited genomic DNA by Cas9.\n\t\nIf mutation of the PAM is not possible, introduce several silent mutations close to the 5' end of the PAM to prevent cutting of the repair template or the edited genomic DNA.\nMake sure to only introduce silent mutations of the PAM if it is present in an exonic region.",
    "Check the codon usage frequency to ensure that the mutated codon is introduced at a frequency that is comparable to the original non-mutated codon (e.g. https://www.genscript.com/tools/codon-frequency-table). In some cases, it might not be possible to introduce the mutated codon at a similar frequency to the unmutated codon. However, for making mutations of a few amino acids, we do not expect the expression level of the mutant protein to be altered significantly.\nIf the edit is small (e.g. mutation of a few bases), introduce a unique restriction site close to the edit by silent mutagenesis. We use http://heimanlab.com/cut2.html to find restriction sites that can be introduced by silent mutagenesis.\n\t\nCheck the codon usage frequency to ensure that the mutated codon is introduced at a frequency that is comparable to the original non-mutated codon. As stated above, this is not always possible. However, for experiments involving mutations of a few amino acids, we do not expect the expression level of the mutant protein to be altered significantly.\nSynthesize and purchase linear single-stranded repair templates for HDR as 4 nmol ultramer oligos.\nResuspend the lyophilized oligonucleotide repair template in nuclease-free water to make a 1 µg/µL stock of the repair template and store it at -30 °C until further use.\n3. Screening primer design\nUsing CLC sequence viewer or other similar applications, design 20 to 23 base pair forward and reverse primers on either side of the edit respectively, such that they produce a band of between 400 to 600 base pairs upon PCR amplification.",
    "For larger insertions that are several kilobases in size, design the forward primer to be located just outside the left homology arm of the repair template. Design the reverse primer to be located within the repair template itself. In this case, a PCR product will only be obtained in the case of positively-edited worms.\nTo identify homozygous-edited worms for longer insertions, amplify the entire region of the insertion by designing forward and reverse primers that are located outside the insertion junctions.\nTest the primers and optimize PCR conditions with wild-type genomic DNA prior to using the primers for genotyping.\n\t\nEnsure that a single band of expected size is produced upon PCR amplification of the genomic DNA (where applicable).\n4. Preparing young adult worms for injection\nPick L2-L3 stage C. elegans onto a fresh bacterial lawn on an MYOB plate and incubate at 20 °C overnight.\n\tNOTE: The protocol for making MYOB plates can be found here: http://www.wormbook.org/wli/wbg13.2p12a/\nOn the day of microinjection, pick young adult worms with fewer than 10 embryos in the uterus to inject.\n5. Preparing the injection mix\nPrepare the injection mix in the same order as shown in Table 1 in sterile nuclease-free tubes.\n\tNOTE: The components of the injection mix can be scaled down to make 5 µL injection mixes (instead of 20 µL) if future injections with this mix are not anticipated.\nMix the injection mix by pipetting.\nIncubate the injection mix at 37 °C for 15 minutes to assemble ribonucleoprotein complexes.\nSpin the injection mix at 4 °C at 17,000 x g for 5 minutes.\n6. Microinjection into the C. elegans  gonad\nPerform microinjection of the CRISPR injection mix into the C. elegans gonad, as described in Iyer et al. 201943.",
    "Inject about 30 worms with CRISPR injection mix. The unused injection mix can be re-used by storing at 4°C for a period of about 6 months without loss of efficiency49.\nInject both gonad arms if possible. Injected worms are considered the P0 generation.\n7. Injected worm recovery and transfer\nAfter microinjection, move the microinjected P0 worms using a worm-pick to a 60 mm MYOB agar plate seeded with OP50 E. coli and let them recover at room temperature for about one hour.\n\t\nNote that the recovery temperature will depend upon the genotype of the injected worms. For example, for temperature-sensitive strains, worm recovery at a different temperature may be necessary.\nUsing a platinum wire worm pick, transfer each injected worm onto a single seeded 35 mm MYOB agar petri plate and allow them to lay eggs at 20 °C until the next day.\nNote that some worms will die as a result of injury from the microinjection procedure. Only pick those worms that are alive and exhibit movement.\nAfter 24 hours, transfer the injected worms to new individual plates (1 worm per plate).\n8. Picking C. elegans for screening\n3 to 4 days at 20°C after the injection was performed, monitor all the plates that contain the progeny of the injected worms using a dissecting microscope.\nIdentify plates that have F1 progeny exhibiting roller (Rol) and dumpy (Dpy) phenotypes. A Dpy phenotype is where worms appear shorter and stouter than control worms at the same developmental stage (WormBase: https://wormbase.org/species/all/phenotype/WBPhenotype:0000583#0--10). Plates with Rol and Dpy worms represent plates where the F1 progeny have been successfully edited with the dpy-10(cn64) mutation to be present in its heterozygous or homozygous state, respectively.\nPick the plates with the most roller and dumpy worms for screening.",
    "Single out 50 to 100 F1 Rol worms from these plates to their own individual plates (1 worm per plate) and allow them to lay eggs.\n\t\nAllow L4-staged F1 Rol worms to lay eggs and produce progeny (F2) for 1 to 2 days.\n9. Single worm lysis and PCR\nAfter producing F2 for 1 to 2 days, transfer each singled F1 Rol mother into 2.5 µL of lysis buffer (Table 2) with a 1:100 dilution of 20 mg/mL Proteinase K.\nFreeze the tubes at -30 °C for 20 minutes. The worms can be stored at this stage for an extended period until further analysis.\nPerform single worm lysis on a PCR thermocycler with the following conditions: 60 °C for 1 hour, 95 °C for 15 min and hold at 4 °C.\nAdd the following reagents directly to 2.5 µL of the lysed worm containing PCR tube: 12.5 µL of 2x PCR mix containing dNTPs, DNA polymerase, MgCl2 and loading dye, 1 µL of 10 µM forward primer, 1 µL of 10 µM reverse primer, and sterile water to 22.5 µL. The total volume of each PCR reaction is 25 µL.\n\tNOTE: In case of screening multiple F1 worms, it is faster and more convenient to make a PCR master-mix for multiple reactions and add 22.5 µL of the master-mix to each lysis tube.\nSet up PCR reactions on a thermocycler with the following conditions: 95 °C for 1 minute, 35 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 15 s (optimize for each primer set), 72 °C for 1 minute (optimize for each target DNA)44. Hold reactions at 4 °C.\n10. Restriction digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis\nNOTE: A restriction digestion is only necessary while screening for small edits (less than 50 bp).",
    "Transfer 10 µL of the PCR DNA from step 9 to a new tube.\nAdd between 2 to 4 units of restriction enzyme and 1x restriction enzyme buffer (1.5 µL of 10x reaction buffer) per 15 µL reaction.\nIncubate at 37 °C (or at other enzyme-specific temperature) for 2 hours (shorter incubation times may be possible with fast acting enzymes).\nHeat inactivate the restriction digest by heating the PCR tubes at 65 °C (or other enzyme-specific temperature) for 10 to 15 minutes.\nLoad the entire reaction from each PCR tube into a single well of a 1%-2% agarose gel and run gel at 110 mA until proper band separation is achieved.\n\tNOTE: We use a PCR mix that already has a loading dye included for visualization while running on an agarose gel. This mix does not interfere with the restriction digestion reaction and is therefore convenient to use for screening many worms at one time.\n11. Identify positively-edited worms\nVisualize agarose gels under UV light (for ethidium bromide gels) to detect DNA band sizes.\n\tNOTE: Positively-edited worms will display an extra band of DNA at the expected size due to editing using the repair template carrying the restriction site at the desired locus within the worm genome. F1 roller worms are expected to be heterozygous for the edit and are therefore expected to exhibit three bands (one wild-type uncut PCR product and two smaller fragments from the edited cut PCR product). Although rare, it must be noted that homozygotes do arise occasionally.\nSave all the original positively-edited plates until the presence of the edit is verified by Sanger sequencing.\n12. Homozygose edit of interest",
    "Pick between 8 and 12 wild-type looking non-rolling F2 worms from the respective positively-edited F1 Rol worm plates and allow them to lay eggs and produce progeny for 1 to 2 days.\n\tNOTE: Since C. elegans are self-fertilizing hermaphrodites, if the edited allele does not affect viability or development, the proportion of expected homozygous mutants should be approximately 25%. Non-rolling F2 worms must be wild-type for the dpy-10 locus. Picking non-rolling worms enables the generation of edited worms that have lost the dpy-10(cn64) mutation and only have the mutation at your gene of interest.\n\t\nNote that the dpy-10 gene is present on chromosome II. If your gene of interest is linked to dpy-10, you may not be able to easily segregate the dpy-10 mutation away from your gene of interest.\nPerform steps 9 thru 11 to identify homozygous worm lines.\n13. Confirm edit by sequencing\nOnce homozygous worms are identified, perform lysis and PCR as described in step 9.\n\t\nSet up at least 3 PCR reactions for each homozygous line to be sequenced.\nPurify the PCR reactions using a PCR purification kit.\nMeasure DNA concentration using a nanodrop spectrophotometer.\nSend sample with the respective forward primer for Sanger sequencing. Ensure that the forward primer is designed to be at least 50 bases away from the edit to be sequenced.\nAnalyze the sequencing results using sequence analysis software to confirm the presence of the edit."
