    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nsiRNA transfection\nTiming: 2–3 days\nTo test GAS2L1 function in centrosome separation, we have used siRNA-mediated knockdown of GAS2L1 expression in RPE-1 cells. Here, we describe the procedures for transfecting siRNAs into cells by using the Lipofectamine RNAiMax transfection reagent.\nCritical: Cells should be ∼20% confluent at the beginning of transfection to ensure efficient siRNA transfection.\nReplace the medium in each well of 12-well plates (containing RPE-1 cells on coverslips; see steps 9 and 10 from the section “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]”) with 0.9 mL of prewarmed fresh culture medium.\nTransfect RPE-1 cells with 20 nM siRNAs (control and gas2l1-targeting siRNAs) by using Lipofectamine RNAiMax according to the manufacturer’s protocol[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FLipofectamine_RNAiMAX_Reag_protocol.pdf]. Specifically, separately dilute 2 μL of Lipofectamine RNAiMax reagent and appropriate amounts of siRNAs in 50 μL of Opti-MEM medium. After incubation for 5 min, add the Opti-MEM–Lipofectamine mix into the Opti-MEM–siRNA mix and incubate further for 15 min before applying to the cells.\nMaintain the cells in a humidified 37°C incubator for 36–48 h until the cells are 80% confluent (similar to the high density shown in this website: https://www.atcc.org/products/crl-4000[href=https://www.atcc.org/products/crl-4000]).\nAlternatives: Lipofectamine 2000 or Lipofectamine 3000 can be used instead of Lipofectamine RNAiMax.\nNote: Knockdown efficiency should be tested in parallel by immunoblotting with an antibody against GAS2L1 (Au et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). Refer to Problem 1 of the section “troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]” if low knockdown efficiency of target proteins is observed.\nNote: Refer to Problem 2 of the section “troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]” if massive cell death occurs after transfection.\nImmunofluorescent staining\nTiming: 3 h\nTo study centrosome separation at late G2, cells are immunostained with an antibody against γ-tubulin to label centrosomes and an antibody against CENP-F to identify late-G2 cells. Inter-centrosome distance is measured in late-G2 cells as an indicator of the centrosome-separating activity.",
    "Critical: Pre-chill methanol at −20°C for optimal fixation.\nFixation\nAspirate culture medium from the transfected cells.\nAdd ∼1 mL of pre-chilled absolute methanol to cells by using a Pasteur pipette and incubate in a −20°C freezer for 5 min.\nAspirate the methanol and rehydrate the cells by incubating with ∼1 mL of PBS for 10 min at 21°C–24°C.\nPause point: Cells can be stored in PBS at 4°C for 2–3 days.\nBriefly rinse the coverslips twice with ∼1 mL of PBST.\nIncubate the coverslips with 0.5 mL of blocking buffer for 30 min at 21°C–24°C.\nStaining with primary antibodies\nDilute the rabbit polyclonal anti-CENP-F antibody (1:200 v/v) and mouse monoclonal anti-γ-tubulin antibody (1:500 v/v) in blocking buffer.\nLoad a 30-μL drop of the diluted antibodies on a piece of parafilm.\nPlace each coverslip on a drop of the antibody mixture by using forceps; cells are placed face down and therefore are in contact with the antibody mix.\nIncubate at 21°C–24°C for 1 h.\nCritical: Ensure that no air bubbles are present in the drop of antibody mix.\nAlternatives: Antibodies against pericentrin can be used instead of anti-γ-tubulin to label centrosomes.\nTransfer the coverslips to the wells of 12-well plates by using forceps; cells are placed face up.\nRinse the coverslips 5 times with ∼1 mL of PBST.\nSecondary antibody staining is performed similarly as the primary antibody staining (step 5), except that donkey anti-mouse IgG (Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated) and donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated) are diluted in PBST (1:1000) for the staining. Cells are incubated with antibodies at 21°C–24°C for 1 h in a dark box.\nTransfer the coverslips back to 12-well plates; cells are placed face up.\nRinse the coverslips thrice with 1 mL of PBST and twice with 1 mL of PBS.",
    "Incubate the coverslips with Hoechst 33258 (1 mL, diluted in PBS to 1 μM) at 21°C–24°C for 2 min to label DNA.\nRinse the coverslips once with ∼1 mL of PBS.\nMount the coverslips on microscopic slides as follows:\nLoad a drop of mounting medium (∼10 μL) on a microscope slide.\nTransfer coverslips onto a Kimwipe by using forceps with cells facing up.\nAir-dry the coverslips for ∼1 min on the Kimwipe and then place each coverslip slowly on a drop of the mounting medium by using forceps (with the cells facing down).\nRemove excess mounting medium from the coverslip edge by using Kimwipes.\nAllow the slides to dry at 37°C for 1 h or at 21°C–24°C for 12–24 h.\nCritical: Ensure that no air bubbles are present in the drop of mounting medium at step 13c.\nPause point: Slides can be stored at 4°C for one month or at −20°C for >6 months in the dark.\nImage acquisition and analysis\nTiming: 1 h\nCells are imaged using an epifluorescence microscope (Axio Observer ZI) equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash4.0 Digital CMOS camera [2048 (H) × 2048(V) effective number of pixels] and an X-Cite series 120Q lamp (Lumen Dynamics); the microscope is operated using ZEN 3.0 software (blue edition), and cell images are acquired using a Plan Apo 100× NA 1.4 oil objective. An epifluorescence microscope with a 60× or 100× objective and a conventional setup is sufficient for imaging and image acquisition. Acquired images are processed using ZEN 3.0 to determine inter-centrosome distances. The analysis can also be performed using other software, such as ImageJ (Schneider et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nImage acquisition",
    "Acquire epifluorescence images by using DAPI (ultraviolet excitation filter), Alexa Fluor 488 (blue excitation filter), and Alexa Fluor 594 (green excitation filter) channels for imaging the signals of nuclear DNA, γ-tubulin, and CENP-F, respectively.\nNote: The two separated or unseparated centrosomes in a majority of cells are well-focused in the same focal plane. Cells containing centrosomes at different focal planes are excluded from the image acquisition and analysis. Both CENP-F–positive and –negative cells are included in the image acquisition.\nImage analysis and measurement of inter-centrosome distance\nLate-G2 cells are identified by the positive staining of CENP-F at nuclei.\nWe determine the nuclear intensity of CENP-F by measuring the mean intensity of CENP-F within the nuclear region (drawn manually using the Contour graphic tool of ZEN software), and we derive the cytosolic intensity as the mean intensity of three 10-μm-diameter circles (created using the Circle graphic tool of ZEN software) randomly positioned in the cytosolic region. The fluorescence intensity of a non-cell area in the micrograph is recorded for background subtraction. Other methods can be used to obtain the same information.\nCells featuring a nuclear-to-cytosolic fluorescence-intensity ratio of >2.5 are scored as late-G2 cells. We measure inter-centrosome distances in both cells in late G2 and cells in stages preceding late G2 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1480-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. RPE-1 cells were transfected with a control siRNA or a gas2l1-targeting siRNA (si-GAS2L1)",
    "Inter-centrosome distances were measured from late-G2 cells (n = 152 and 194, si-Control and si-GAS2L1, respectively) and prior-to-G2 cells (n = 188 and 186, si-Control and si-GAS2L1) in three independent experiments. White dashed lines indicate the cell boundary. Scale bars, 10 μm. Error bars denote SD of three independent experiments. Box-and-whisker plots: lower and upper edges of the boxes represent lower and upper quartiles (25%–75%), respectively; lines within the boxes are the medians; lower and upper whiskers extend from the lower quartile down to 10% and from the upper quartile up to 90%, respectively. ∗, p < 0.01; n.s., not significant (p > 0.5); unpaired Student's t test. [Reproduced from (Au et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1])].\nMeasurement of inter-centrosome distance.\nManually position a circle surrounding centrosomes as defined by γ-tubulin staining by using the Circle graphic tool of ZEN software. The software tool automatically marks the circle centers, which are the centrosome centers.\nUse the LINE tool of ZEN software to measure the distance between the centers of two centrosomes, which provides the inter-centrosome distance.\nNote: Acquired cell images can be imported into ImageJ to identify late-G2 cells and to quantify inter-centrosome distance by using similar methods as described above."
