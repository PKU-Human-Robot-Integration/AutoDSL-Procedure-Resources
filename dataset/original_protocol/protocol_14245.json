    "All experiments were completed in accordance and compliance with all relevant regulations (‘European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and other Scientific Purposes’ (Directive 2010/63/EU) and animal care was in accordance with institutional guidelines. All experiments have been performed with male C57BL/6JRj mice at the age of 6 months.\n1. Preparation\nPrepare a surgical microscope and a heating pad as well as a rectal probe to monitor the body temperature. Clean and sterilize all surgical instruments.\nPrepare 2 pieces of 10 cm 5-0 silk thread for vessel ligation, 5 cm of 6-0 polypropylene thread, and 2 mm silicon tube for ligation of the LCA.\nPrepare the PV catheter calibration cuvette by pre-heating it to 37 °C and prepare a 100 µL Hamilton syringe filled with 15% sodium chloride (NaCl) in H2O for saline calibration.\nPlace the PV catheter (3 cm, 1.4 F) in 37 °C pre-heated 0.9% NaCl in H2O (saline) at least 30 min before measurement. Connect the catheter to the data acquisition device and connect the device to an analog/digital converter. Connect both devices to a computer.\nSet up the software. Perform software-guided pressure calibration and conductance calibration as demanded by the software-guided workflow8.\n2. Anesthesia and Analgesia\nAnesthetize the mouse using ketamine 100 mg/kg body weight and xylazine hydrochloride 10 mg/kg body weight by intraperitoneal injection. At the beginning of I/R surgery, administer 0.05 mg/kg body weight buprenorphine intraperitoneally to maintain analgesia.\nAfter 10 min, perform an endotracheal intubation using a 20 G intravenous (iv) catheter and ventilate the mouse with 40% oxygen (O2) and 2% (v) isoflurane. Set appropriate ventilation parameters (e.g., 220 µL stroke volume, 150/min for a 25 - 30 g C57BL/6JRj mouse).",
    "Continuously monitor body temperature via rectal probe. Fasten mouse on the heated plate with the head pointing towards the investigator. Mouse normal body temperature is 36.5 - 38 °C. Maintain body temperature within 1 degree by adjustment of heated plate temperature.\n3. Left Ventricular Catheterization\nDisinfect chest and neck with three alternating scrubs of betadine and 70% alcohol.  Wait for skin disinfectant to dry. Remove the chest hair by using a small animal shaving system. \nPerform a 10 mm longitudinal median incision 5 mm beneath the bottom lip towards the sternum using small surgical scissors.\nDissect the left and right part of the submandibular gland via blunt preparation using a forceps. Separate muscle and fat tissue in the right paratracheal region to expose the right commune carotid artery. Mobilize and separate the vessel for a total length of 5 - 10 mm from connective tissue via careful blunt preparation alongside the vessel with a bent forceps.\n\tNOTE: Avoid mechanical manipulation of the vagus nerve or the carotid body at all time as this can cause severe hypotension and bradycardia.\nPass the two prepared silk threads under the vessel. Ligate the distal vessel with a tight knot and place a loose knot on the proximal exposed region that still allows passage of the catheter.\nFix the threads of the cranial (tight) knot next to the head of the mice to apply a light tension on the vessel as this will facilitate the introduction of the catheter. Place a hemostat vascular clamp on the proximal vessel proximal of the loose knot to reversibly block blood flow.\nPerform a wedge-shaped incision 1 mm proximal to the cranial knot to open the vessel with micro scissors.\n\tNOTE: A small drop of blood will indicate proper execution of this step.",
    "Insert the catheter carefully for 10 mm. Start recording of catheter data.\n\tNOTE: Stretching the incision with a forceps can make this process easier.\nExtract the vascular clamp. Add 1 - 2 drops of saline to the incision to facilitate catheter movement. Continue introducing the catheter for approximately another 10 mm. After passing the proximal knot with the sensor tip, fasten the knot carefully just enough to prevent blood reflux alongside the thinner parts of the catheter without impairing catheter movement.\n\tNOTE: The size of the sensor at the tip of the catheter prevents reflux of blood when extracting the vascular clamp.\nGently continue inserting the catheter until pressure analysis shows arterial blood pressure profile indicating that the catheter is placed in the aorta (Figure 3A).\n\tNOTE: The catheter reaching the aortic valve will be indicated by light resistance and pulse-synchronized motion of the catheter.\nWhen experiencing resistance trying to advance through the aortic valve, pull the catheter back 5 mm and advance again until LV catheterization will be indicated in a change in PV analysis as diastolic pressure will reach 0 - 20 mmHg (Figure 3B). Note changes in volume monitoring to further confirm left ventricular placement of the sensor tip (Figure 3C). Fasten the proximal knot more tightly to prevent catheter movement.\n4. Ischemia/Reperfusion Surgery\nPerform skin incision from caudal sternum towards the left axilla for a total length of 15 mm. Proceed with blunt preparation of the two muscle layers until the ribs can be visualized.\nOpen the thorax via incision between the third and fourth left rib. Use surgical hooks to gain access to the pericardium. Resect the pericardium above the heart. Before continuing with LCA ligation, wait 30 s without touching the animal to record PV data for valid analysis.",
    "Localize the LCA emerging under the left auricle and descending at the left side of the heart towards the apex. Use a 6-0 polypropylene suture to encircle the artery with a loop 2 mm underneath the left auricle. Place a small silicon tube under the loop and place a tight knot above.\n\tNOTE: Distal myocardium turning grey serves as positive control for LCA occlusion6. I/R surgery should be performed within 5 min independently from the operating investigator.\nCut the suture at 1 mm length. Release the surgical hooks and manually close the muscle layers above the incision. Wait 45 min while continuously recording PV data.\nAfter 45 min, re-open the incision and remove the silicon tube to induce reperfusion. Record data for another 20 min.\n\tNOTE: A change to a red color as seen before ischemia indicates successful reperfusion.\n5. Calibration\nNOTE: The calibration of the PV catheter system consists of 4 mandatory steps, two of which have to be performed after the measurement. Calibration should be repeated after every experiment to ensure valid results.\nPerform pressure calibration and conductance calibration before the experiment as described in Step 1.5.\nPerform saline calibration when the catheter is still placed in the left ventricle after the experiment itself is finished. Localize the right jugular vein lateral of the carotid artery in the prepared area. Inject 10 µL 25% NaCl in H2O via a Hamilton syringe while recording data.\nCalculate the calibration using the acquisition software by highlighting the ascending phase in volume curve (Figure 5C). Repeat this process for a total of 3 times. Avoid loss of blood after syringe extraction by using a vascular clamp to rapidly compress the puncture.",
    "Perform volume calibration to calibrate volume data acquisition by analysis of standardized volumes. Obtain approximately 500 µL mouse blood from cardiac puncture with a slightly heparinized 1 mL syringe (e.g., 5 µL per 200 IE heparin). Pull back the PV catheter 10 - 15 mm to avoid damaging the catheter.\nFill the obtained blood into the 37 °C pre-heated calibration cuvette (Figure 5A). Avoid bubbles as it may interfere with the results. Add the catheter tip into each well and record data. Obtain a standard curve by software-guided analysis (Figure 5B). Repeat the process for a total of 3 times.\nEuthanize mice by exsanguination or cervical dislocation while sufficient isoflurane anesthesia is maintained at all time.\n6. Data Analysis\nAfter completing the calibration steps, perform software-guided data analysis. Therefore, highlight the appropriate section (at least ten cycles) within the Analyze section of the PV Workflow and perform baseline analysis. Exclude cycles with deviations due to ventilation or manipulation if necessary (Figure 3D).\nPerform PV baseline analysis before passage of the aortic valve (arterial pressure only), immediately before and after LCA occlusion. Proceed by conducting PV baseline analysis and in intervals of 5 min. while ischemia and after reperfusion. At the end of the experiment, perform analysis of pressure data after retraction of the catheter from the left ventricle (arterial pressure).\nAnalyze at least 10 consecutive cycles to avoid sampling error. When experiencing strong interference of obtained values with the ventilation, transient interruption of the ventilation for a maximum of 5 s can be considered.\nUse the following parameters that are calculated in Baseline Analysis (Figure 3D) to characterize LV function:\n\t\nStroke volume (µL)\nEjection fraction: Stroke volume / end-diastolic volume (%)\nCardiac output: Stroke volume * heart rate (µL/min)\nCardiac index: Cardiac output / body surface area (µL/(min*cm²)",
    "Stroke work: Inner area of PV curve (mmHg*µL)\nMaximum pressure (Pmax); Mean pressure (Pmean)\nmax dP/dt (mmHg/s) as a parameter of LV systolic function\nmin dP/dt (mmHg/s) as a parameter for LV compliance\nTime constant of isovolumetric relaxation: Tau (ms)\nSubscription Required.
