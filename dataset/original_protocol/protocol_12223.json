    "All animal uses are approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Boston Children's Hospital.\n1. Sample Preparation\nTimed mating\nPlace a C57Bl6 wild type male and a female together in the same cage.\nCheck for the formation of a mating plug early next morning. The mating plug (aka, vaginal or copulation plug) is a hardened gelatinous deposition that blocks the vagina.\nSet the plug date as embryonic day 0.5 (e0.5).\nIsolation of mouse embryos\nEuthanize pregnant females by CO2 asphyxiation.\nPut mice supine on an absorbent pad and spray abdominal region with 70% ethanol.\nLift the skin and make an initial 5 mm incision at the caudal abdominal region using surgical scissors. Cut and remove the abdominal skin to fully expose the internal organs\nCut near vagina to remove the entire uterus.\nCut between implantation sites along the uterine horn. Each segment or conceptus should have only one embryo inside.\nKeep the uterine segments in 1x ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\nEmbryo dissection\nPlace each conceptus in a separate dish with ice-cold PBS under a stereoscope.\nRemove uterine tissues, placenta and then fetal membranes sequentially using fine dissecting forceps.\nTransfer the dissected embryo to a 50 ml tube with 1x ice cold PBS using a large transfer pipette. Avoid picking up embryo directly with forceps to minimize tissue damage.\nFixation\nFix the dissected embryos in 10% neutral buffered Formalin solution at 4 °C for more than 24 hr with at least 10 sample volumes of fixative.\nPretreatment\nPrepare the Clearing Solution: 4 M urea, 10% glycerol, 4% Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) in double distilled water.\nReplace the fixative with the Clearing Solution.",
    "Gently rotate the specimen on a rocker at room temperature for 1 - 2 weeks. Exchange the Clearing Solution once on the second and the third day. The specimen slowly becomes clear and translucent.\nReplace the Clearing Solution with 10% formalin and leave on a rocker for 2 days.\nDehydration\nWash the pretreated samples with 1x PBS 3 times for 5 min each.\nDehydrate samples in an ascending ethanol series at room temperature on a gentle rocker. For E15.5 embryos, use an ascending ethanol series including 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% and 100% ethanol, 2 hr each step. For older embryos, the incubation time needs to be increased.\nStaining\nPrepare Staining Solution: add 0.1375 grams of Eosin Y Disodium Salt and 0.0275 grams of Acridine Orange hemi (zinc chloride) salt to 50 ml of 100% ethanol. Stir for 2 hr. Filter with a filter paper. Store at room temperature and avoid light by covering with aluminum foil.\nTransfer specimen to the Staining Solution for 1 hr.\nReplace with fresh Staining Solution and stain overnight.\nInfiltration\nPrepare Infiltration Solution: combine 100 ml of Solution A of JB-4 embedding kit, 1.25 g of Catalyst C, 0.275 g of Eosin Y Disodium Salt and 0.055 g of Acridine Orange hemi (zinc chloride) salt. Stir to mix (200 rpm) in an ice bucket for 2 hr, and then filter with the filter paper.\nStore the Infiltration Solution at 4 °C and avoid light by covering with aluminum foil.\nTransfer the embryos to Infiltration Solution:Staining Solution (1:1), and incubate for at least 3 hr on a rocker at 4 °C.\nTransfer the embryos to Infiltration Solution and incubate for 3 hr on a rocker in a cold room.",
    "Replace Infiltration Solution once every day, and leave in a cold room on a gentle rocker for three more days.\n2. Embedding\nKeep Solution B and Infiltration Solution on ice.\nMake Embedding Solution (1:25 of Solution B and Infiltration Solution) immediately before embedding.\nOrient the specimen in a embedding mold, then pour cold Embedding Solution into the embedding mold gently. Re-orient with a pin if needed.\nUse a pin to examine whether the Embedding Solution is solidified. Push out the specimen block, and trim it if needed.\nReorient the specimen block using the separate mold to obtain a cross orientation.\nPut a block holder on top of the embedding mold. Gently pour Embedding Solution into the mold until the mold and the block holder are submerged by Embedding Solution.\nKeep the specimen in a secondary container and leave it on ice for 3 - 4 hr in a fume hood.\nStore the solidified specimens in a 4 °C.\nPeel away the embedding mold. Put the block under the stereomicroscope with oblique illumination to inspect position of the specimen in the block. On the block face, mark grid lines around the specimen.\nTrim the block to remove access amount of embedding material using the marked grid lines as references.\n3. Image Acquisition\nClamp the specimen block to the microtome and obtain a fresh cut surface. Set section thickness (e.g., e9.5-10.5, 1.5 µm; e11.5-12.5, 2.0 µm; e13.5-15.5, 2.5 µm; e16.5-older, 3 µm). Keep the specimen/block at the home position of microtome.\nMount the stereo zoom microscope horizontally facing the block surface of specimen.\nTurn on the computer and microscope, and start the image acquisition software.\nVisualize and focus the optics to the block-face under the \"live view\" mode of imaging software.",
    "Align microscope and microtome if needed so that the block-face is at the center of viewfinder.\nAdjust zoom so that the entire block-face is within the viewfinder.\nSelect green fluorescent protein (GFP) filter (excitation 470 ± 20 nm, dichroic 495 nm, emission 525 ± 25 nm) and refocus if needed.\nMeasure and set the exposure time manually (e.g., 80 - 400 mini sec).\nAcquire images of the block-face after each fresh cut and save images automatically if possible.\nRecord important parameters including resolution, section thickness and zoom.\nAfter finishing the entire specimen, export and convert all image files to JPEG format if necessary.\nInvert all original images using an imaging processing software, and adjust brightness and contrast.\nSave all the processed images in a separate folder.\n4. 3D Visualization\nUpload all the processed images to a 3D visualization software following the instructions.\nInput resolution and section thickness to convert all images to volumetric data (i.e., voxel size) and save the 3D file.\nAlign all images using the automatic mode. Adjust individual images manually if needed.\nSave the aligned image to a new file name.\nAnalyze morphometric features of the specimen using the 3D visualization software.\nSubscription Required.
