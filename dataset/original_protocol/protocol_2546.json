    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nBody Temperature Measurement\nTiming: 5 min\nBody temperature, one of the vital signs measured in the clinical setting, allows for evaluation of the presence of fever (i.e., elevated body temperature) or hypothermia (i.e., low body temperature). Interestingly, mice do not develop fever when they have systemic infection/inflammation; in fact, their body temperature decreases during these conditions (Copeland et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Therefore, by measuring the body temperature we can evaluate the response of mice to different stimuli, indirectly distinguishing between a local and a systemic inflammatory response. In line with this concept, we recently investigated the changes in body temperature among different mouse models of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced preterm birth. We showed that the intra-amniotic injection of LPS induced preterm birth without changing the body temperature, resembling the sub-clinical nature of this condition in pregnant women. However, the intra-peritoneal administration of LPS induced preterm birth accompanied by maternal hypothermia, showing that these models resemble a systemic inflammatory response (Gomez-Lopez et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). A summary video of the procedure is shown in Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nTransport the mouse to the Vevo® imaging station.\nPlace a small amount of Aquagel® lubricant gel on a piece of gauze in preparation for the body temperature measurement. The gel will be used once you are holding the mouse (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nMethods Video S1. Measurement of Maternal Body Temperature (Refer to Body Temperature Measurement, Steps 2–8)\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/218-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Temperature Measurement Procedure\n(A) Application of Aquagel® lubricant gel to the gauze pad.\n(B) Dipping the rectal probe in Aquagel® lubricant gel.\n(C) Insertion of the rectal probe into the mouse’s anus.\nSee also Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nTake the mouse out of the cage and place it on the wire lid.",
    "Hold the mouse by the base of its tail, exposing the anus.\nIf the mouse begins to defecate (a natural stress response), gently remove any adherent feces with tweezers if needed.\nTake the rectal probe (thermometer) and dip the tip of the probe into the Aquagel® lubricant gel that was previously prepared (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nStimulate the anal sphincter with the tip of the rectal probe and insert the rectal probe into the anus while holding the mouse firmly to avoid movement (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nLook at the physiological monitor and record the temperature once it has stabilized.\nTake the probe out carefully to avoid any damage to the rectum or anus.\nPlace the mouse back in its cage.\nClean the rectal probe with disinfectant spray.\nCritical: We recommend measuring maternal temperature as the first step of the evaluation of physiological parameters because the body temperature of the mouse changes while under anesthesia. Be very careful to insert the rectal probe into the anus instead of the vagina. If you notice that the mouse is nervous, you can cover it with a napkin to keep it calm and avoid the risk of injury of the mouse\nNote: Aquagel® can be stored at room temperature.\nBlood Pressure Measurement\nTiming: 40 min",
    "One of the greatest physiological changes during pregnancy occurs in the maternal cardiovascular system, resulting in reduced maternal blood pressure and an increased resting pulse (Robson et al., 1989[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]; Clark et al., 1989[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Mahendru et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]) due to hormonal and anatomical changes (Wilson et al., 1980[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]; Chapman et al., 1998[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). On the other hand, around 2%–7% of pregnant women present with pre-eclampsia, a pregnancy complication characterized by hypertension and proteinuria that has deleterious effects on both the mother and the fetus (Redman and Sargent, 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]; Chaiworapongsa et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Moreover, during severe inflammatory processes in humans, such as sepsis, maternal blood pressure decreases, causing hypotension (Singer et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]). Therefore, measuring blood pressure in pregnant mice is a useful tool to understand the systemic changes induced by any type of treatment. A video demonstrating the mouse preparation for blood pressure measurement is shown in Methods Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2].\nSoftware setup for the CODATM Non-invasive blood pressure system\nPersonnel Manager\nGo to “Tools,” then select “Manage Personnel.”\nIn the “Researcher” tab, click on the “+” button and add the Researcher’s name or identifying information as preferred.

Once you click “Finish,” the experiment will start.\nAnimal Setup\nAnimal restrainer",
    "Place the cage containing the mouse next to the CODA™ platform.\nOpen the restrainer, removing the rear hatch. Release the nasal cone in order to have free movement in case the nasal cone needs to be moved while placing the mouse into the restrainer.\nHold the mouse by the base of its tail and place it into the restrainer with its head facing toward the nasal cone.\nSecure the rear hatch, being careful not to pinch the mouse’s tail or any other body parts. Keep its tail in your hand the entire time, do not release it.\nWhile holding the mouse by the base of its tail, slide the nasal cone backward to limit the mouse’s movements. Secure the nasal cone.\nPlace the restrainer over the warming platform. Keep the mouse on the warming platform for 5 min to acclimate it. We recommend covering the restrainer with a dark cloth to reduce stress to the mouse.\nCuff Setting (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A)\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/218-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "High-resolution Doppler ultrasound has emerged as a key tool for evaluating maternal and fetal well-being. In the clinical setting, maternal Doppler ultrasound assessment (i.e., uterine arteries) is used to stratify the risk of developing pre-eclampsia and intra-uterine growth restriction (Martin et al., 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]; Figueras and Gratacos, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Poon et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]; Sotiriadis et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]). Moreover, the umbilical artery Doppler is used to evaluate fetal well-being and to predict deleterious outcomes in a fetus with fetal growth restriction (Yoon et al., 1993[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]; Turan et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]; Tarca et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]; Meyer et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). In addition, the Doppler wave shape can be used to measure fetal heart rate. A video demonstrating the anesthesia and mouse preparation for ultrasound is shown in Methods Video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]. A video summarizing the high-resolution Doppler ultrasound procedure is shown in Methods Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4].

    "Once the ultrasound is turned on, click on the “New” button located at the top of the screen.\nClick on “New Study.”\nEnter the Study name (e.g., “Star Protocol”) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nSelect the “Owner.”\nOptional: Enter the “Grant Institution.”\nEnter the “Series Name.” We recommend keeping the “Series name” the same as the “Animal ID.”\nIn “Acquired By,” select the person who is going to perform the ultrasound experiment.\nIn “Application,” select “General imaging.”\nIn “Measurement Package,” select “Cardiac Package.”\nIn “Animal ID,” copy and paste the name chosen as the “Series Name.”\nEnter the “Color,” “Strain,” “Weight,” “Date of birth,” and “Sex” of the mouse.\nSelect “Pregnant” and add the “date plugged.”\nIn “Series note” experimental details or notes can be recorded.\nClick on the “Ok” button located in the top-right corner of the screen.\nIf the 3D motor stage is connected, there will be a message asking whether you would like to initialize it. Select “No”.\nAnesthesia (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C)\nTurn on the oxygen tank and set the oxygen flow to 2 L/min.\nTurn on the isoflurane and set it to 2%.\nRemove the mouse from its cage and place it into the “Induction chamber.”\nStart a timer immediately after placing the mouse in the “Induction chamber.”\nAfter 3 min, remove the tubing from the “Induction chamber” and connect it to the tubing for the nasal mask on the heating pad at the ultrasound station.\nCarefully remove the mouse from the “Induction chamber” and move it to the heating pad of the ultrasound station.\nPlace the mouse in the supine position (i.e., with the face and torso facing up) and connect the mouse’s snout to the nasal mask on the heating pad. If the mouse starts moving, see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: Problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].",
    "Place 1 drop of Syntane® lubricant eye ointment on a cotton swab (approximately 3mm in diameter). Use the swab to place the drop in one of the mouse’s eyes, and then repeat this step for the other eye (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/218-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

Use as many gauze pads as needed to remove all of the Nair™ cream.\nIn case there are still areas of fur that were not removed by the initial application of Nair™ cream, more Nair™ cream can be applied locally in these spots. All of the abdominal fur must be removed prior to performing the ultrasound (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D).\nCritical: Nair® cream can irritate the skin of the mouse, even causing chemical burns. Therefore, it is imperative to remove the cream completely with the dampened gauze. Avoid applying Nair® cream to the genital area of the mouse because irritation may occur and be a confounding variable for the experiment.",
    "Fixation of the mouse and insertion of the rectal probe (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D).\nRemove the Aquasonic® ultrasound gel from the oven and place a drop of gel on each of the electrodes of the heating pad.\nTake each of the mouse’s paws and secure them on the electrodes of the heating pad using the tape that was previously prepared.\nPlace a drop of the Aquagel® lubricating gel on a napkin and spread the gel on the tip of the rectal probe (thermometer) before inserting the rectal probe into the anus of the mouse.\nHold the tail and insert the rectal probe in the anus of the mouse.\nSecure the rectal probe to the heating pad using the last piece of tape that was previously prepared.\nGeneral ultrasound scan (B-mode)\nTake the Aquasonic® ultrasound gel out of the oven and shake it vigorously to move all of the gel toward the nozzle to avoid creating bubbles.\nCover the mouse’s abdomen with the Aquasonic® ultrasound gel (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]E). Avoid creating bubbles because they can distort the image.\nThe transducer should be oriented transverse to the abdomen and positioned directly over the lower part of the abdomen (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]F). If the ultrasound image is disturbed/not clear, see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: Problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nCount and determine the localization of the pups (Figures 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A&B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/218-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Representative Maternal Bladder Imaging and Mapping of Pups\n(A) Representative ultrasound image showing the maternal bladder from the transverse view.\n(B) Example of drawn map showing the location of each pup relative to the maternal bladder.\nSee also Methods Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4].",
    "First, localize the maternal bladder. It is usually located in the midline and is recognized as a non-echogenic round structure. Its size will vary according to the presence of urine. This organ is going to be our reference point for localizing and mapping the pups (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A).\nOnce the bladder is identified, start scanning the abdominal midline of the mouse from the bladder to the sternum. We recommend drawing the position of the pups immediately after identifying them to document the correct number of pups as well as the correct location of each.\nOnce you finish scanning the midline, move the transducer back to the bladder (reference point). Then, using the bar located under the stage, tilt the heating pad to orient the right side of the mouse higher than the left side.\nWith the mouse tilted, start scanning from the bottom to the upper part of the right side, counting and localizing the pups on this side.\nRepeat the previous two steps for the left side of the mouse.\nUpon finishing the general scan, you should have a map similar to the one shown in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B showing the distribution of each pup.\nUmbilical Artery Doppler Ultrasound\nTo obtain representative measurements and to avoid keeping the mouse under anesthesia for too long, we performed the measurements in three pups per dam. We included the first pup in each uterine horn plus one of the pups that is easier to measure according to its position.\nAfter you localize the pup to measure, scan its abdominal wall as well as the placenta to identify the position of the umbilical cord.\nPress the “Color” button to activate the color Doppler and to better identify the umbilical cord.",
    "You can adjust the size of the square frame of the color Doppler to make it larger or smaller by pressing the “Update” button and simultaneously moving the scroll ball.\nAdjust the “Velocity” button to optimize the vessel image.\nAdjust the “Doppler Gain” button to optimize the vessel image.\nThe umbilical artery is the vessel that has a pulsatile image.\nYou can use the “Image depth” button as well as the “Zoom” button to better localize the umbilical cord. To obtain an optimal measurement, focus on the area of the umbilical cord between the placenta and the abdominal wall of the pup.\nPress the “PW” button to activate the pulsed-wave Doppler.\nUsing the scroll ball, move the cursor to place it at the center of the umbilical cord. Adjust the size of the cursor by moving the “SV/Gate” up or down. The cursor has to be inside of the umbilical artery. If not, the measurement is going to include the umbilical vein, distorting the wave shape.\nAdjust the angle of insonation by turning the “PW angle” button. The angle has to be as close to 0o as possible. An angle <30o is acceptable.\nPress the “PW” button again to see the wave of the umbilical artery.\nIf the entire wave is not seen, the baseline can be moved down using the “baseline” button.\nIf the wave is inverted, its direction can be modified by pressing the “Invert” button.\nOnce an adequate wave shape is obtained, press the “Cine Store” button to save a mini-video of the measurement.

The uterine artery is a curve-shaped artery that has a high velocity flow; therefore, the color that you will see varies between red, yellow, and blue (i.e., aliasing).",
    "Once you localize the artery that seems to correspond to the uterine artery, press the “PW” button. The uterine artery is characterized by having a velocity of >100 cm/s. If the artery has a velocity <100 cm/s, it is likely not the uterine artery. Therefore, continue moving the transducer until the uterine artery is found.\nOnce an optimal wave is obtained, press the “Cine Store” button. The typical wave shape of the uterine artery is shown in Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B.\nPress the “Study management” button to double-check that the video was recorded and to identify the artery that was measured, following the same steps used for the identification of the umbilical artery.\nRepeat the same procedure in the left uterine artery.\nCompleting the animal experiment\nAfter obtaining the measurement of the left uterine artery, lift the transducer up.\nWipe off all of the Aquasonic® ultrasound gel from the mouse with the dampened gauze.\nRemove the tape from the rectal probe (thermometer) and carefully remove the rectal probe from the rectum.\nRemove the tape from the paws of the mouse and clean them off.\nDepending on the aim of the study, you can leave the mouse in a recovery cage with a heating lamp. It should be recovered in about 5–10 min after removal from anesthesia. On the other hand, if the mouse will not be used to observe pregnancy or neonatal outcomes, it can be euthanized by cervical dislocation while still unconscious from anesthesia.\nTurning off the anesthesia and oxygen and cleaning the machine\nImmediately after removing the mouse from the nasal mask, stop the timer and record the length of the experiment.\nTurn the Isoflurane to 0% and the oxygen to 0 L/min.\nTurn off the oxygen tank.",
    "While the oxygen tank is off, turn the oxygen to 10 L/min to flush the rest of the oxygen from the system.\nRemove the isoflurane tubing from the nasal mask back and connect it back to the “induction chamber.”\nClean all of the gel from the heating pad as well as the ultrasound transducer.\nDisinfect the thermometer, heating pad, and probe with disinfectant spray.\nAnalysis of umbilical artery and fetal heart rate\nGo to “Study management” (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]C).\nSelect the video of the first umbilical artery measured by double-clicking on it (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]C).\nThe video will start playing immediately.
