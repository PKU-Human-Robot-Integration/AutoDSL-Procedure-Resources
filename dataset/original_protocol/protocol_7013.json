    "Cell preparationPlace coverslips in 24-well plateTake out coverslips from the 75% ethanol-containing centrifuge cube using sterile tweezers and place them on a sterile plate. Expose them to ultraviolet (UV) light for approximately 30 min with the other required material, including PBS, trypsin, culture medium (DMEM medium with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin, see Recipe 1), and 24-well cell culture plate.Ensure that both sides of the coverslips are dry to avoid cells being killed by the remaining ethanol.Drop approximately 5 μl cell culture medium on each well. Place dry coverslips on the drop with sterile tweezers. Press the coverslips gently and remove the excess fluid to ensure they are firmly stuck to the bottom of the well.Cell seeding and cultureRemove the medium from the cell culture flask (T25) containing the cells and wash with 2 ml PBS. Remove the PBS and add 500 μl 0.05% trypsin for 2 min to detach cells from the cell culture flask wall.Seed a number of cells according to the experimental requirements, e.g., transfecting with siRNAs or overexpression plasmids (see Note 1). Shake the plate crosswise and lengthwise to prevent the local growth of cells from being too dense. Then allow cells to grow at 37°C in an incubator with 5% CO2. Remember to add control groups when performing the colocalization (see Note 8).Treat cells in accordance with the experimental requirements. Aim at cell densities resulting in 70-80% confluency to avoid cells overlapping.Immunofluorescence stainingWhen cells grow to 70-80% confluency, remove the medium and rinse once with 500 μl PBS for 5 min. The following steps do not need to be performed under sterile conditions.Unfreeze the 4% PFA in advance. Add 300 μl of 4% PFA to each well for 20 min at RT.",
    "Remove the fixative and rinse cells with PBS three times for 5 min (see Note 4).Remove the PBS and add 300 μl of permeabilization solution to each well for 5 min at RT.Remove the permeabilization solution and rinse with PBS three times for 5 min.Block with 300 μl of blocking solution for 1 h at 37°C.Remove the solution and rinse with PBS three times for 5 min.Primary antibody incubation:Dilute antibody A (MRPL12, 1:200) and antibody B (Nrf2, 1:300) with PBS (see Notes 5, 6, 7).Add several drops of PBS on adhesion microscope slides, and then place a piece of parafilm on each slide. Expel bubbles to ensure the film tightly attaches to the slide.Clamp out coverslips from the plate with tweezers and touch the edge of the paper towel to remove the remaining solution.Put coverslips on the parafilm with cell-facing upward and add approximately 50 μl diluted antibody to cover it fully.To avoid loss of the antibody by volatilization, incubate the slides in a wet chamber overnight at 4°C.Optional step: After overnight incubation, keep slides at room temperature for approximately 30 min.Lift up coverslips and put them back into wells with the cell-facing surface facing up. Rinse with PBS three times for 5 min.Secondary antibody incubation:Dilute the secondary antibody Alexa Fluor®-488 (1:1,000) and Alexa Fluor®-594 (1:1,000) with PBS (see Notes 5, 6).Add 300 μl secondary antibody solution to each well.Incubate the samples at 37°C for 1 h in the dark.After secondary antibody incubation, protect the cells from light exposure. Remove the secondary antibody and rinse with PBS three times for 5 min.To visualize nuclei, add the PBS-diluted Hoechst 33342 (1:1,000) to the coverslips for 10 min at RT.Remove the solution. Rinse with PBS three times for 5 min.Mounting, storage, and imagingLabel microscope slides with the sample information.",
    "Drop approximately 5 μl antifade mounting medium for each coverslip on the glass slide. Then, place the coverslips on the mounting medium with the surface containing the cells facing down and ensure that there are no bubbles. Remove the excess fluid if needed.Samples can be stored for approximately 1 week at 4°C or 2 months at -20°C in the dark. Longer storage is not recommended.Use a Nikon inverted fluorescence microscope to capture images from five different fields on each sample; select regions randomly (Figure 1). The excitation wavelengths of Hoechst 33258, Alexa Fluor 488, and Alexa Fluor 594 are 345 nm, 499 nm, and 591 nm, respectively. Record fluorescence from individual channels separately.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4191/bioprotoc-11-20-4191-g001.jpgFigure 1. Immunofluorescent staining in Nrf2 overexpressed or knocked down HK-2 cells. HK-2 cells were fixed with methanol. Nrf2 (red), MRPL12 (green), and nuclei (blue) were stained as described in the protocol. Images were captured and merged using a Nikon inverted fluorescence microscope. Scale bar is 50 μm.
