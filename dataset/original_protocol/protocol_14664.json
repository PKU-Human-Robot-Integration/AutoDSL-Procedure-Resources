    "All procedures on experimental animals described in both the video and manuscript were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and followed the guidelines set by the Canadian Council of Animal Care.\n1. Surgical Anesthesia and Surgical Preparation of the Neonatal Pigs\nIn a separated anteroom, premedicate 25 kg pigs near the base of the neck with an intramuscular sedative-anesthetic drug cocktail containing: azaperone (0.3 mg/kg), ketamine hydrochloride (10 mg/kg), dexmedetomidine (15 µg/kg).\n\tNote: Add buprenorphine (0.005-0.02 mg/kg) in the pre-anesthetic drug cocktail for enhanced intra-operative pain control.\nAnesthetize the pigs with inhaled isoflurane inhalation gas (4-5% isoflurane at 500 ml-1,000 ml/min O2) using a face mask. Visualize the vocal cords using a veterinary laryngeal scope (17-25 cm long straight blade), and apply topical 10% lidocaine spay to the vocal cords. Allow the lidocaine spray to contact the vocal cords 30-60 sec prior to intubation to reduce the possibility of vocal cord spasm and airway obstruction.\nIntubate the pigs by passing a cuffed endotracheal tube (5.0-7.0 mm Internal Diameter (ID)) between the vocal cords and maintain the anesthesia with isoflurane gas (0.5-2.0% isoflurane at 1,000-2,000 ml/min O2) using a closed circuit rebreathing anesthetic system throughout the surgery. Assess the level of anesthesia by jaw tone, and both pedal and palpebral reflex responses. Expired anesthetic gas is scavenged and vented outside the surgical suite.\nClean the exterior surface of the ear with 2.0% chlorhexidine surgical scrub solution followed by a 70% isopropyl alcohol rinse. With a 20 G intravenous catheter, catheterize an ear vein to provide intravenous fluids (Lactated Ringer's Solution; 5-10 ml/kg/hr) during the surgery. Secure a pulse oximeter to the mucosal surface of the tongue with medical tape to monitor heart rate and the saturation of peripheral blood oxygenation (SpO2).",
    "Place the anesthetized pig in a dorsal recumbent position and shave the ventral abdomen from the mid thorax caudally to the ventral aspect of the pubis. Clean this area with two alternating 2.0 % chlorhexidine surgical scrubs and sterile water washes.\nTransfer the anaesthetized pig to the surgical suite and apply the final surgical scrub of 70% isopropyl alcohol rinse, allow it to dry, and then drape the animal.\nInsert a rectal temperature probe approximately 2-4 cm into the rectum to monitor body temperature. Place the pigs on a water recirculating heating pad to maintain normal body temperature (38-40 °C) during surgical procedure.\nDrape the pig with four towels drapes placed in an overlying quadrant pattern around the abdomen. Place the first drape across xiphisternum, the second drape along lateral aspect of the abdomen approximately 5 cm lateral to the abdominal midline. Place the third drape across the ileal crest of the pelvis and the fourth drape, like the second drape (although on the opposite side), is placed along the lateral aspect of the abdomen approximately 5 cm lateral to the abdominal midline.\nPlace a large table drape, with a slit-opening allowing access to the surgical site, over the underlying towel drapes and cover the pig and entire surgical table. The final drape is a disposable steri-drape placed over the large table drape.\n2. Abdominal Surgery and Catheterization of the Intestinal Lymphatic Trunk\nMake a 20 cm skin incision with a scalpel blade to expose the underlying abdominal muscles. Incise the abdominal muscle layers with mono-polar electrocautery (20 Watts setting) to expose the parietal peritoneum. Open a 20 cm linear segment of parietal peritoneum with Metzenbaum scissors to access the abdominal viscera and lymphatic vessel.",
    "Place a retractor at the cranial aspect of the surgical incision to keep the abdominal cavity open for the duration of the surgery.\nMoisten all tissues with warm (37 °C) sterile saline for the entire surgical procedure. Gently lift a large segment of intestine including the colon, cecum, ileum and jejunum from the abdominal cavity and exteriorize it to the left flank of the pig to access the upper abdomen, liver and lymphatic vessel. Secure the exteriorized intestine in position with additional towel drapes to form a sling to gently support the intestine.\nLocate the lymphatic vessel, it lays approximately 4 cm cranial-medial of the right renal vein, 6 cm caudal-medial- ventral of the caval foremen and underneath the visceral aspect of the right liver lobe near the pancreas22,36,37. Identify the lymphatic vessel as a translucent structure juxtaposed to the right ventral segment of the portal vein36,37.\nSeparate the lymphatic vessel from the surrounding fascia by gently teasing away the attached tissue with Q-tip applicators. Once the lateral aspects of vessel are separated from the surrounding tissue, create a \"tunnel\" opening underneath the vessel with fine blunt tipped forceps.\nPass three 2-0 silk sutures underneath the lymphatic vessel with fine forceps. Ligate the most caudal suture first to occlude, dilate and fill the vessel with lymph. Purposefully leave the ends of this suture relatively long (4 cm) to secure the catheter to the lymphatic vessel. Place two other sutures separated 1.0 cm from each other and are approximately 1.0-1.5 cm cranial to the secured caudal suture. Leave these two sutures with a 'single loose ligature tie' to allow for faster securing of the catheter into the vessel.",
    "Note: The segment of the lymphatic vessel located between the most caudal ligating suture and middle suture (of the two cranial sutures) is the site for catheterization. Regarding suture material, 2-0 polyglactin suture can substitute for 2-0 silk sutures if required.\nCut a small hole into the vessel with iris scissors and dilate the vessel with fine blunt forceps. Insert approximately 1.0-1.5 cm of specialized catheter tubing (4.06 Outer Diameter (OD) X 2.31 mm ID) with a beveled end into the vessel and tie the two cranial sutures to secure the catheter in place. Use the long suture ends of the caudal suture to secure the catheter to the vessel.\nWash the exteriorized intestine with copious amounts of warm saline and gently return it to the abdominal cavity ensuring correct anatomical positioning of the gut.\nExteriorize the catheter at the left mid flank (5-10 cm ventrally from the paralumbar fossa). Make a skin incision with a scalpel and pass a trocar from the abdominal cavity to the skin surface to create an opening for the exteriorization of the catheter. Use a large Kelly forceps to exteriorize the catheter from the abdominal cavity through the trocar opening.\nClose the parietal peritoneum with a simple continuous suture pattern of 2-0 polyglactin suture with a round (tapered) needle. Close the abdominal muscle layers with a simple interrupted suture pattern with a 2-0 polyglactin suture on a round needle.\nClose the skin in a subcuticular pattern with 2-0 polyglactin suture on a cutting needle. Secure the exteriorized catheter to the skin with a purse-string suture pattern and a 2-0 nylon suture on a cutting needle.\nPlace a specialized jacket on the pig while still anesthetized to ease its placement and reduce the stress of the pig during recovery.\n3. Post-surgical Recovery and Lymph Collection",
    "Approximately 10 min prior to the discontinuation of inhalation anesthesia, administer bupenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) intramuscularly to provide immediate post-surgery analgesia. Continue bupenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) every 12 hr for 24-48 hr to maintain post-surgery analgesia.\nMonitor the pigs for post-surgical complications every 8-12 hr for a 7 day period.\nCollect the lymph in 500 ml polypropylene wash bottles, coated with ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), and supplemented with antibiotics; penicillin (6,000 IU), streptomycin (6 mg) and amphotericin B (3 mg) every 12 hr for a 7 day period.\n4. Quantification of Lipoprotein ApoB48, Triglyceride, Cholesterol and Total Protein Collected from Lymph\nCentrifuge the lymph sample at 1,800 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Collect the supernatant and use it for the quantification of triglyceride, cholesterol and total protein.\nDivide the supernatant into three samples: an undiluted sample, a sample diluted 1:20 distilled water and a final sample diluted 1:100 with distilled water.\nUse the undiluted supernatant to measure cholesterol levels, with a commercially available kit.\nUse the 1:20 and 1:100 diluted samples to measure triglyceride and total protein levels with a commercially available kit and the bicinchoninic acid-total protein assay respectively.\n5. Quantification of Lipoprotein ApoB48, Collected from Lymph38\nDetermine the concentration of lipoprotein ApoB48 with an adapted immune Western Blotting method38. Separate total lymph with 3-8% tris-acetate- sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).\nTransfer the separated proteins to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (0.45 µm) and incubate them with a goat polyclonal antibody to ApoB (1:4,000), then bind it with an anti-goat secondary antibody.\nQuantify the lipoprotein ApoB48 with chemiluminescence using a linear densitometric comparison with purified rodent ApoB48 protein standard.\nSubscription Required.
