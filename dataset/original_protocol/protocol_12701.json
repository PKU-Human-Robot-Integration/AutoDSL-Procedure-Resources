Parasite Culture Preparations\nTulahuen strain of Trypanosoma cruzi is used throughout this report. Maintain epimastigotes of T. cruzi in LIT medium (10% FCS, see Supplemental Table 1). Securely close the cap and keep the culture flask at 28 °C.\nGenerate a transgenic strain of T. cruzi that harbors the Cas9 endonuclease. Examples of the expression plasmids that contain Cas9 coding sequence and G418 (neor) selection marker can be found in Lander et al.4 and Peng et al.5\nTransfect the above plasmid into epimastigote by electroporation, using the kit listed in the Table of Materials. For 1 cuvette, spin down 2 x 107 cells, discard the supernatant, and resuspend with 100 µL of electroporation buffer containing the provided supplement solution.\nNOTE: The electroporation buffer can be substituted with EM buffer24 (3:1 mixture of cytomix25 and phosphate-sucrose buffer).\nAdd 20-40 µg of plasmid and transfer the mixture into a 2 mm gap electroporation cuvette. Apply the pulse with an electroporation device (see Table of Materials), using the X-14 program26.\nTransfer the cuvette contents into a T-25 flask containing 5 mL of LIT medium (10% FCS). Incubate the flask at 28 °C for 24 h.",
    "Add G418 to a final concentration of 250 µg/mL and continue incubation at 28 ˚C. It takes about 1 week to kill off the non-transfected epimastigotes. Once the G418-resistant population starts to recover, passage the culture once or twice a week to avoid saturation and to dilute out the dead cells. Establishment of a stable cell line usually takes total of 4 weeks.\nNOTE: If constitutive expression of Cas9 is a burden for the cell5, make the expression specific to the amastigote stage by conjugating the 3’-UTR of amastin gene immediately downstream of the Cas9 open reading frame27. The detailed description of the amastigote-specific Cas9 expression plasmid can be found in Takagi et al.22\nEstablish a host-parasite co-culture of Cas9-expressing T. cruzi and mammalian host cells. In this report, use 3T3-Swiss Albino fibroblast cell as a host.\nDifferentiate T. cruzi epimastigotes into metacyclic trypomastigotes. Determine the cell density of the epimastigote culture using a hemocytometer and collect 5 x 107 cells by centrifugation for 15 min at 2,100 x g. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cells with 10 mL of RPMI medium. Incubate the parasite at 28 °C for 1 week28.\nCollect metacyclic trypomastigotes in RPMI medium. Carefully tilt the flask and pipet out the solution without disturbing the parasites adhered to the bottom surface. Transfer the medium to a conical tube and centrifuge for 15 min at 2,100 x g. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the parasite with 5 mL of DMEM (10% FCS).\nNOTE: The parasite population is a mixture of metacyclic trypomastigotes, epimastigotes, and some intermediate forms. Although not necessary, you can isolate trypomastigote by DEAE ion exchange chromatography29. Alternatively, epimastigotes can be eliminated by incubating the parasites with active serum to subject them to complement lysis30.",
    "Seed 3T3-Swiss Albino fibroblast cell to 60-70% confluency, or about 1.7-2.0 x 106 cells in 5 mL of DMEM (10% FCS) in T-25 culture flask. Remove growth medium and apply the parasite mixture from step 1.3.2. Incubate for 24 h at 37 ˚C under 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator to establish infection.\nRemove the parasites remaining outside of the host 3T3 cells by washing the co-culture with DMEM (10% FCS) twice.\nOnce the co-culture is saturated, passage amastigote-infected host cells by trypsinization. Aspirate the medium and rinse the culture once with PBS. Apply 1 mL of 0.05% trypsin solution to cover the entire culture surface, and incubate for few minutes at room temperature until the attached host cells become loose. Detach the cells from the flask surface by flushing 3 mL of DMEM (10% FCS) over the cells.\nTransfer detached host cells into a conical tube, and centrifuge for 3 min at 300 x g. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells with 3 mL of fresh DMEM (10% FCS). This step helps to eliminate remaining epimastigotes. Transfer all into a clean T-75 flask containing 9 mL of DMEM (10% FCS). Continue culturing until trypomastigote is released into culture supernatant.\nMaintain the co-culture by passaging with trypsinization twice a week. Once 70-80% of the host population become infected, regularly add uninfected host 3T3 cells at the ratio of 5:1 (carryover:fresh), in order to avoid culture deterioration. Trypomastigote egresses continuously if the balance between host cells and T. cruzi is properly maintained.\n2. Differentiation of Trypomastigotes into EA",
    "On the day before this experiment, remove the growth medium of host-parasite co-culture and add fresh DMEM (10% FCS) to wash away EA and trypomastigotes that had already been released from the host cells in previous days. Regular experiments require at least two T-75 flasks of confluent co-culture.\nCollect culture supernatant into a conical tube to harvest freshly emerged trypomastigotes. Check the sample under a microscope (10x or 20x objective lens) for the quality. If there is host cell debris, briefly centrifuge the sample and transfer the supernatant into a new tube. If there are significant number of EAs, isolate trypomastigotes by the following swim-out procedure.\nSpin down the mixture of trypomastigotes and amastigotes for 15 min at 2,100 x g. Discard most of the supernatant, leaving 0.5-1.0 mL of medium in the tube.\n\t\tNOTE: Reducing the volume is optional, but it makes the following step easier.\nIncubate the pellet at 37 ˚C for 1-2 h, allowing active trypomastigotes to swim out of the pellet (Figure 2).\nTransfer the supernatant containing trypomastigotes to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the conical tube for 15 min at 2,100 x g to collect trypomastigotes. If the swim-out procedure was performed above, centrifuge the 1.5 mL tube for 2 min at 4,000 x g to pellet the trypomastigote. Discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet with 5 mL of DMEM buffered with 20 mM MES (pH 5.0), supplemented with 0.4% BSA19. Transfer the parasite to a T-25 culture flask. Leave the cap loose. The cell density must be around or below 1 x 107 cells/mL, since oversaturation increases the chance of cell death.",
    "NOTE: The color of the DMEM must be yellow, not orange. If the original DMEM had high buffering capacity, 20 mM MES (pH 5.0) is not enough to lower the pH. The pH of the medium must be adjusted by addition of HCl in that case. The acidic medium can be kept at 4 ˚C, but no longer than 1 month.\nIncubate the culture flask at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Around 95% of parasites differentiate into amastigotes after 24 h.\n3. Electroporation of EA\nPrepare gRNA for electroporation. This can be done by in vitro transcription, or simply by purchasing synthetic RNA oligonucleotides from a manufacturer. In this report, crRNA and tracrRNA from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. are used.\nCentrifuge the culture of EAs for 15 min at 2,100 x g. Discard supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet with electroporation buffer containing provided supplement solution to the final cell density of 1 x 108 cells/mL.\n\tNOTE: EM buffer causes more cell deaths compared to the electroporation buffer listed in Table of Materials; thus, it is not recommended for amastigote transfection (Supplemental Figure 1).\nAliquot 100 µL of resuspended parasites (1 x 107 cells) into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes. Add 5-10 µg of gRNA and gently mix by pipetting.\nTransfer the mixture to a 2 mm gap electroporation cuvette. Apply the pulse with the electroporation device, using X-14 program.\nTransfer the cuvette contents into a T-25 flask containing 5 mL of pre-warmed LIT medium (10% FCS). Leave the cap loose and incubate the flask at 37 °C under 5% CO2.\nMonitor the cell growth either by continuation of axenic culturing (section 4) or as intracellular amastigotes after host cell infection (section 5).\n4. Monitoring the Growth of Knockout Cells as Axenic Amastigotes",
    "EAs settle at the bottom of the culture medium, so gently shake the flask to resuspend them into the solution. Washing the flask surface by pipetting helps, as some cells are adhered to the flask.\nMix 1 µL of propidium iodide (PI) solution (20 µg/mL) with 20 µL of amastigote culture.\nNOTE: Do not leave the culture flask outside of incubator for longer than necessary. Temperature is one of factors that enables axenic proliferation22.\nApply the sample onto hemocytometer and observe under a fluorescence microscope. PI is permeant to damaged cell membrane but is excluded from live cells. Count the number of viable amastigotes that are not stained by PI (ex/em 570 nm/602 nm).\n5. Monitoring the Growth of Knockout Cells as Intracellular Amastigotes\nSeed host 3T3 cells in a 12-well plate with DMEM (10% FCS). Adjust the cell density to 70-80% confluency, or about 3 x 105 cells per well.\nNOTE: Since amastigotes are not motile, covering most of the growth surface by the host cells improves infection efficiency.\nCollect knockout amastigotes from step 3.6 by centrifugation one day after electroporation. Discard the supernatant, and resuspend the parasite with 2 mL of DMEM (10% FCS).\nRemove medium from the host cell culture and apply resuspended amastigotes. Multiplicity of infection should be 20 or higher. Incubate the plate at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for 2 days to allow amastigotes to establish infection.\nNOTE: Infection period can be 1 day, depending on the purpose.\nWash away EAs remained outside of the host cells twice with DMEM (10% FCS).\nAdd fresh DMEM (10% FCS) to the host-parasite co-culture and continue the incubation at 37 °C for additional 2 days.\nTo evaluate infection efficiency, visualize nuclei of the host cells and intracellular amastigote.",
    "NOTE: Nuclei tend to be overlapped in saturated co-culture. Re-plating the cells at lower cell density (such as 1:5 dilution) prior to fixation and staining helps to count nuclei more easily.\n\t\nRemove culture medium and apply 1 mL of 10% formalin solution in PBS to fix the cells. Incubate for 10 min at room temperature.\nReplace the formalin solution with 1 mL of PBS containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst 33342 and 0.1% Triton X-100. Incubate for 5 min at room temperature.\nRemove the Hoechst solution and rinse the cells once with PBS. Add 1 mL of fresh PBS.\nObserve under fluorescence microscope and identify host cell nuclei that are associated with smaller parasite nuclei (Figure 4). Host cells that contain more than 2 amastigotes should be considered as infected, not to include nonproductive initial infection or unwashed EAs.\nSubscription Required.
