    "The differentiation protocol (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.137#cpz1137-fig-0002]) begins with plating hPSCs into a culture regime that allows precise control of BMP signaling levels, achieved by simultaneous treatment with BMP4 recombinant protein along with a BMP type-I receptor inhibitor (DMH-1, an approach dubbed as Top-Down inhibition; Hackland et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.137#cpz1137-bib-0013]), WNT signaling activation through GSK-3 inhibition mediated by the WNT agonist CHIR99021, and TFG-β pathway inhibition by employing the ALK receptor inhibitor SB431542. Following 4 days of treatment, the resulting population displays an anterior/cranial NC character reflected by the upregulation of SOX10, PAX3, PAX7, p75, and the lack of HOX gene expression. Medium supplementation with RA during days 4 to 6 induces a vagal axial identity marked by the upregulation of the corresponding HOX genes (HOXB4, HOXB5), a step which coincides with the acquisition of an ENS precursor character as evidenced by ASCL1, PHOX2B expression.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d30fb65b-1e2e-4f93-a085-411c72ead72f/cpz1137-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nVagal NC/early ENS progenitor induction from hPSCs.

Remove PBS.\nAdd Accutase solution (100 μl per cm2) and incubate at 37°C for 5-7 min.

Do not aspirate Accutase solution as this will result in losing the cell population.\nAgitate conical tube to ensure adequate mixing and transfer 10 μl cell suspension to a hemocytometer.\nCount cells using the hemocytometer.\nMeanwhile centrifuge cell suspension at 300 × g for 4 min at room temperature.\nAfter centrifugation, aspirate supernatant carefully and dislodge cell pellet in neural crest induction medium supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 2HCl (see Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.137#cpz1137-tbl-0002]).\nWe recommend resuspending cells at a ratio of 1 million cells per ml.\nPlate cells at a density of 30,000 to 40,000 cells per cm2 on a Geltrex pre-coated plate in neural crest induction medium supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 2HCl.\nThat is, plate 30 μl of cell suspension (∼30,000 cells) per cm2.\nFor a well of a 6-well plate with a surface area of ∼10 cm2, transfer 300 μl of cell suspension.",
    "Cell density is very critical for neural crest differentiation efficiency and it is cell line dependent. We highly recommend performing cell density titration for every cell line used to ensure optimal yield.

    "Replace culture medium with freshly made and supplemented medium (200 μl/cm2).\nRetinoic acid is extremely sensitive to light and high temperature; do not warm up medium with retinoic acid and keep plate out of light.\nAt Day 4, cells reach ∼95% of confluency (Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.137#cpz1137-fig-0002]), an indicator of the success of the protocol.

Day 6:\n         \nEnd of vagal neural crest differentiation: Cells cover 95%-100% of the growth surface forming a monolayer, appear dark and spiky (Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.137#cpz1137-fig-0002]).\nCells are ready for replating in non-adherent conditions prior to the generation of enteric neurons and glia (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.137#cpz1137-prot-0002]).\nOptional: Assess vagal neural crest induction by flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR; for details about experimental techniques refer to Frith et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.137#cpz1137-bib-0008]; Frith et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.137#cpz1137-bib-0009]).\nUnderstanding results",
    "At the end of the differentiation, vagal NC cells/early ENS progenitors should form an almost confluent monolayer, exhibiting stellate-like morphology and appearing darker compared to hPSCs. The characteristic morphology of the cells as the NC protocol progresses is depicted in Figures 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.137#cpz1137-fig-0002] and 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.137#cpz1137-fig-0003]. The efficiency of NC induction is indicated by the upregulation of NC-associated transcripts such as SOX10, PAX3, PAX7, and TFAP2A as well as ENS progenitor markers (e.g., ASCL1, PHOX2B; Fig. 2C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.137#cpz1137-fig-0002] and Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.137#cpz1137-tbl-0003]). The acquisition of a vagal axial identity can be verified by the marked increase in the expression HOX PG (3-5) transcripts (e.g., HOXB4, HOXB5; Fig. 2D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.137#cpz1137-fig-0002]). At this stage we also found that typically around 45%-65% of cells are positive for SOX10 protein following intracellular staining and analysis by flow cytometry and this SOX10+ population also co-expresses high levels of p75 (Hackland et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.137#cpz1137-bib-0013]; Fig. 2E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.137#cpz1137-fig-0002] and Table 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.137#cpz1137-tbl-0004]) and the surface marker alpha-4 integrin (CD49D; Fattahi et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.137#cpz1137-bib-0007]; Fig. 2E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.137#cpz1137-fig-0002]).\nTable 3.\n                List of Primers Used for Vagal Neural Crest/Early ENS Progenitor Characterization\ntable:\n﻿Gene,Forward,Reverse,Roche UPL probe\nGAPDH,5′-agccacatcgctcagacac-3′,5′-gcccaatacgaccaaatcc-3′,# 60\nSOX10,5′-ggctcccccatgtcagat-3′,5′-ctgtcttcggggtggttg-3′,# 21\nPAX3,5′-aggaggccgacttggaga-3′,5′-cttcatctgattggggtgct-3′,# 13\nPAX7,5′-gaaaacccaggcatgttcag-3′,5′-gcggctaatcgaactcactaa-3′,# 66\nASCL1,5′-cgacttcaccaactggttctg-3′,5′-atgcaggttgtgcgatca-3′,# 38\nPHOX2B,5′-ctaccccgacatctacactcg-3′,5′-ctcctgcttgcgaaacttg-3′,# 17\nTFAP2A,5′-aacatgctcctggctacaaaa-3′,5′-aggggagatcggtcctga-3′,# 62\nHOXB1,5′-ccagctagggggcttgtc-3′,5′-atgctgcggaggatatgg-3′,# 39\nHOXB2,5′-aatccgccacgtctcctt-3′,5′-gctgcgtgttggtgtaagc-3′,# 70\nHOXB4,5′-ctggatgcgcaaagttcac-3′,5′-agcggttgtagtgaaattcctt-3′,# 62\nHOXB5,5′-aagcttcacatcagccatga-3′,5′-cggttgaagtggaactccttt-3′,# 1\nHOXB7,5′-ctacccctggatgcgaag-3′,5′-caggtagcgattgtagtgaaattct-3′,# 1\nHOXC9,5′-gcagcaagcacaaagagga-3′,5′-cgtctggtacttggtgtaggg-3′,# 85\nTable 4.\n                Antibody List Used for Flow Cytometry Analysis of Vagal Neural Crest/Early ENS Progenitorsa[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.137#cpz1137-tbl9-note-0001_70]\ntable:\n﻿Antibody,Company,Catalog number,Species,Class\nAnti-CD49d,BioLegend,304302,Mouse,Monoclonal\nAnti-SOX10,Cell Signaling Technology,89356,Rabbit,Monoclonal\nAnti-p75,Cell Signaling Technology,8238,Rabbit,Monoclonal\na Working dilutions have to be optimized depending on antibody data using a series of dilutions in a titration experiment.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2bb286cc-7792-4465-822b-ffe4c1a6139c/cpz1137-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4",

    "The protocol (Fig. 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.137#cpz1137-fig-0004]) continues with re-plating vagal NC cells generated from 2D monolayer differentiation into non-adherent conditions that promote formation of 3D cell sphere aggregates. These are then subsequently re-plated in adherent conditions and in the presence of neurotrophic medium to promote further differentiation toward ENS components. During that stage, SOX10+ progenitor cells migrate out of the re-plated spheres to give rise to enteric neurons and glia. The emergence of neurons, marked by downregulation of SOX10 and induction of neural markers, precedes glial occurrence, which is accompanied by sustained expression of SOX10 and upregulation of glial markers.\nMaterials\nVagal NC cells (from Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.137#cpz1137-prot-0001])\nDulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12 Ham (Merck Life Science, cat. no.

    "Be gentle while transferring cells to the plate; avoid scraping the bottom of the well with the pipet tip.\nPlace plates into a plate holder and centrifuge at 100 × g for 2 min at room temperature.\nThis step collates single cells in the middle of the well to increase cell-cell contact and assist sphere formation.\nFollowing centrifugation, cell suspension is visible at the center of the well.\nIncubate cells at 37°C for 24 hr.\nDo not disturb plates for the first 24 hr.\n4.

    "Spheres are re-plated into neurotrophic medium for further differentiation towards ENS derivatives.\nIf spheres have fused, forming large irregularly shaped aggregates, we prefer to break them up into smaller spheres and culture them for an additional day prior to culture in neurotrophic medium (see Troubleshooting, Table 10[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.137#cpz1137-tbl-0010]).\nTransfer spheres to a 50-ml conical tube and triturate sphere suspension two to three times by pipetting towards the side of the tube.

However, the wells should remain confluent to allow neural induction to occur otherwise the differentiation will fail.\nCells could be maintained in culture under ENS conditions for extended periods to allow further maturation. To date, cells have been successfully cultured in ENS medium up to day 100.\nAfter day 30-35, perform half medium change biweekly (every 3-4 days) and increase medium volume from 200 μl/cm2 to 400 μl/cm2.\nIf cells start dethatching or axons seem to wobble with plate movement, supplement medium with vitronectin (1:100) once a week.\nUnderstanding results",
    "The neurons tend to form at regions of high density across the well, converge, and create big clumps of neuronal cell bodies that are interconnected with axonal processes that span the whole well (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.137#cpz1137-fig-0004]). Neurons first appear and migrate out of the spheres around day 12 of the protocol (2 days after culture in neurotrophic medium; Fig. 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.137#cpz1137-fig-0004]). Between day 17-22, neural fibers are visible and cells express pan-neuronal markers such as neurofilament heavy chain (NF-H), HuCD, TUJ1, PERIPHERIN, and TRKC (Fig. 4C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.137#cpz1137-fig-0004] and D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.137#cpz1137-fig-0004]), markers widely used in the literature for enteric neuron characterization (Table 9[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.137#cpz1137-tbl-0009]). Glial cells expressing S100β and SOX10 emerge around day 20-22 and grow in close vicinity to the neuronal cell bodies (Fig. 4D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.137#cpz1137-fig-0004]). At this stage, the cell cultures are comprised of a mixture of neural and glial cells that differentiate and mature further as the protocol progresses (Fig. 4E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.137#cpz1137-fig-0004]). For a more detailed expression analysis of the generated neurons, refer to the original study of Frith et al. (2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.137#cpz1137-bib-0009]). We regularly observe emergence of contaminant cells that lack the characteristic neuronal morphology and are not immunoreactive to ENS lineage markers (ASCL1, PHOX2B, SOX10). These do not appear to influence negatively the induction of neurons and/or glia."
