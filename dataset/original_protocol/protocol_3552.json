    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAnalysis of protein trafficking by western blot and endo H analysis\nTiming: 1 week\nThe analysis method described here relies on the differential PAGE mobility and molecular weights of distinct forms of lysosomal proteins that occur during the maturation process, such as proteolytic cleavage and N-linked glycosylation. N-linked glycosylation of lysosomal proteins occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which permits the proper folding and export out of the ER. Once proteins have passed the quality control checkpoints in the ER, transport into the Golgi occurs, where the enzyme -mannosidase II further modifies N-linked glycans. N-linked glycans are then resistant to endoglycosidase H (Endo H), a bacterium-derived glycosidase commonly used in protein-glycan analysis. Therefore, by determining the amount that is Endo H resistant, the approximate subcellular location of lysosomal proteins is revealed. Endo H resistant and sensitive forms are identified by SDS-PAGE/western blot by molecular weight analysis. Below, we focus on the lysosomal protein β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) as a representative example. However, similar principles apply to other proteins that mature through the lysosomal and secretory pathways. Analysis of protein extracts from any source, including cell cultures, whole organism model systems, or tissues, can be performed using this protocol.\nHydrolases measured by this method include hexosaminidase, B-galactosidase, cathepsin B, iduronate-2-sulfatase, and GCase.",
    "When setting up the culture experiment, it is useful to include a tunicamycin-treated culture well as a control. Tunicamycin will prevent glycosylation and maturation of the protein of interest, allowing for a direct comparison of this control sample and your experimental sample, aiding in the assay's interpretation. Each assay should be done with at least three technical replicates and confirmed in two to three independent experiments or iPSC passages. If desired, digestion of purified RNase B can be used as an additional control to confirm the activity of activity of Endo H and PNGase F. Glycosylated RNase B can be purchased from New England Biolabs.\nMaking an extract (4 h)\nUsing a cell scraper, scrape cell cultures from a 12 or 6-well dish of iPSC-derived neurons into 1 mL cold 1× PBS and pellet by centrifugation at 400 × g, 5 min, 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend pelleted material in an appropriate volume (200–400 μL per well of a 6-well dish) of cold protein extraction buffer containing 1% Triton X-100.\nUse a Teflon homogenizer with a motor-driven spindle to homogenize the extract in a conical glass vessel 20–40 times at 2,000 × g. Then, incubate the extract in an ice-water slurry with gentle rotation for 20 min.\nNote: When homogenizing the cell pellets, use care not to generate excessive froth. Homogenize the extract until there are no particles; it should be even and slightly translucent. If a pipet tip is not visible when inserted in the solution, add more lysis buffer to the extract and re-homogenize.\nClarify the extract by centrifugation at 20,000 × g, 4°C for 10 min. Transfer the supernatants to a new 1.5 mL tube.",
    "Perform a protein assay on the supernatant using a Pierce micro BCA kit (Thermo Fisher # 23235) or standard Bradford reagent (Boston Bioproducts # BPA-200).\nNote: Keep the pellet fraction if desired, but the supernatant fraction of this extract will contain most hydrolases.\nDigest the lysate with Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) and PNGase F (3 h).\nDenature 50 μg of protein lysate from each sample by adding 1× denaturation buffer (included with Endo H and PNGase F from New England Biolabs).\nAdd 50 μg of protein lysate + water, up to 18 μL.\nAdd 2 μL of 10× denaturation buffer and incubate at 100°C for 10 min in a dry bath.\nPulse-centrifuge the sample to spin down any evaporated liquid.\nDigest the denatured lysate with glycosidase enzymes Endo H and PNGase F in two separate tubes:\nFor the addition of Endo H: add 2.5 μL of 10× G5 digest buffer (included with the enzymes from NEB) + 1.5 μL of water + 1 μL of Endo H and incubate for 2 h at 37°C.\nFor the addition of PNGase F: add 2.6 μL of 10× G5 buffer + 2.6 μL of 10% NP-40 (included with the enzymes from NEB) + 1 μL PNGase F and incubate for 2 h at 37°C.\nNote: In parallel, prepare an undigested control sample by using water instead of enzymes. Incubate the control sample under the same conditions as experimental samples.\nPause Point: After the 2-h incubation, the digest can be stored at −80°C until western blot analysis is performed.\nRun a western blot (3 h).\nBoil digest samples in 1× Laemmli sample buffer for 10 min at 100°C.",
    "Critical: Boil for at least 10 min to fully separate the different glycosylated forms of the proteins. After boiling, do not place the sample on ice since this may cause SDS to precipitate and prevent efficient separation of protein. The sample will be stable at 20°C for up to 1 h until the gel is loaded.\nRun the samples on 10% Tris-glycine gels that are 1.5 mm thick and can hold 10 wells. Set the initial voltage at 120 V for 20 min, followed by running at 150 V for 1–3 h depending on the protein of interest. GCase migrates between 55 kDa and 70 kDa. To achieve sufficient separation of distinct GCase forms, run the gel until a 36 kDa marker of the ladder is 1 cm from the bottom of the gel, which usually takes about 3 h.\nNote: The mature forms of some hydrolases (e.g., Cathepsins and Hexosaminidase B) migrate at 10–20 kDa. To prevent run-off of these forms, stop gels at the appropriate time.\nTransfer onto PVDF membranes according to the particular transfer apparatus used. For the Thermo Fisher mini blot apparatus, transfer for 1 h at 20°C at a constant voltage of 20–30 V (approximately 300 mA starting current per gel). This protocol utilizes fluorescent secondary reagents, and therefore Millipore Immobilon-FL 0.45 μm membranes (# IPFL00005) are used to prevent high background signals.",
    "Remove the membrane and postfix in 100% MeOH for 1 min, then wash in 1× Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) (TBS) for 2–5 min until the membrane sinks. Stain the gel in Coomassie brilliant blue for 12–24 h, followed by washing in water for 2 h. This gel is to be used as a loading control. Under these transfer conditions, a portion of the total protein remains within the gel due to the presence of 20% MeOH in the transfer buffer. While the MeOH promotes protein binding to membranes, it slows the elution from SDS-PAGE gels. This is particularly noticeable in high and middle molecular weight proteins that do not elute out of the gel as easily as low molecular weight proteins.\nNote: Alternatively, postfix the membrane in 0.4% PFA. The PFA is made in 1× PBS and incubated for 20 min on a slow rotator, followed by 3 × 5 min washes in water. The optimal postfix method should be determined by the end-user and depends on the protein of interest and antibody. For GCase, either MeOH or PFA postfixing methods work equally well.\nBlock the membrane in a 1:1 mix of 100% Odyssey Block Buffer (OBB) and 1 × TBS (No Tween) for 1–1.5 h.\nNote: This protocol is optimized for fluorescent-conjugated secondaries using the Li-Cor Odyssey scanner. Other scanners can be used with equal success. Other secondaries, such as HRP and ECL reagents, are not recommended due to the limited quantitative range.",
    "Add primary antibodies for the lysosomal hydrolases of interest to a 1:1 mix of OBB: 1× TBS-Tween 0.2%. Add this solution to the membranes and incubate for 12–24 h 4°C. For GCase antibodies from Sigma, a dilution of 1:500 to 1:1,000 should work, depending on the secondary reagent's antibody lot and sensitivity. Through pilot studies, the end-user can determine optimal antibody conditions. It is crucial to record the antibody lot number, as different batches tend to change in both antibody concentration and binding efficiency.\nPause Point: Incubate the membrane for 12–24 h at 4°C until performing western blot imaging and analysis the following day.\nImage and quantify western blots (4 h).\nWash the membranes three times, 10 min each, in 1× TBS-Tween 0.2% at 20°C.\nAdd secondary antibodies in at 1:10,000 in OBB : 1× TBS-Tween 0.2% 1:1 mix and incubate the membranes at 20°C for 1–2 h.\nWash membranes three times, 10 min each, in 1× TBS-Tween 0.2% at 20°C.\nScan and analyze using an Odyssey infrared imaging system (or similar system), and analyze with Imaging software (e.g., Image Studio Software (Li-Cor) or Image J).\nBy comparing the undigested, Endo H digested, and PNGase F digested samples, identify and quantify the post-ER/ER forms of each protein. Quantify protein maturation by calculating a ratio of post-ER/ER forms. Each form can also be quantified separately and normalized to a loading control (e.g., GAPDH, tubulin, or Coomassie blue).",
    "Critical: During the lysis step, efficient homogenization is necessary, and a fresh enzyme is required for the complete digestion of samples. To achieve a clean separation of individual glycosylated forms of lysosomal hydrolases, avoid gradient gels and use the acrylamide percentage suited for the protein of interest. For most proteins that average 50–70 kDa in weight, 10% polyacrylamide is suitable. Using an antibody that is capable of detecting mature and immature forms is also critical. During the maturation process, portions of most hydrolases are cleaved in the ER, and therefore some epitopes may be removed. It is best to use a specific polyclonal antibody that will react with multiple regions of the protein of interest and to know the exact amino acid sequence where the antibody reacts.\nAnalysis of protein trafficking by immunofluorescence staining of iPSC-derived neurons\nTiming: 2 days\nThis assay is used in combination with Endo H/western blot analysis to confirm the location of lysosomal hydrolases in fixed cells. Changes in hydrolase trafficking are a dynamic process but can be estimated by quantifying the hydrolase’s steady-state levels within ER, Golgi, and lysosomal compartments by colocalization analysis. Complementation of the Endo H analysis with this immunostaining protocol will provide stronger evidence for changes in protein trafficking. Immunofluorescence staining does not involve cell lysis, thereby eliminating confounding biochemical processes that could occur post-lysis.\nFix and immunostain cells (2 days).\nPlate cells on PDL and laminin-coated coverglass in 24 or 12 well plastic culture plates.\nNote: iPSC-neuron cultures require plates with PDL and laminin coating; other cell types may require different coating conditions. Cells should be plated at a density that allows for imaging of individual cells.",
    "Quickly remove the culture media and immediately add 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 1× PBS for 20 min at 20°C under a fume hood. The cells should not be left dry for more than a few seconds, so this may require the fixation of only a few wells at a time.\nRemove the 4% PFA and wash the cells 3 times for 5 min in cold PBS to completely remove PFA. Place both the 4% PFA and washes in a designated waste container according to the institution's hazardous waste guidelines.\nPermeabilize and block cells: For GCase, use 0.2% saponin (w/v)/1× PBS for 5 min, then 0.2% (w/v) glycine/0.2% saponin in 1× PBS for min. Next, block the cells with 2% bovine serum albumin, 5% normal goat serum in 0.2% saponin/1× PBS for 30 min.\nMake the primary antibody dilutions in blocking buffer, preparing 50 μL of solution per 24 well-sized cover glass. For anti-GCase, use a 1:1,000 dilution. Place a 50 μL droplet of the primary antibody solution for each cover glass onto a parafilm sheet inside a humidity chamber.\nNote: To create a humidity chamber, place a water-saturated paper towel along the side of a large square culture plate (e.g., Thermo Fisher #166508).\nCarefully remove the cover glasses from the plastic culture plate while the block solution is still in the well, and flip onto the primary antibody solution on parafilm so that the cell-side is facing down. Place the chamber in a safe location and incubate for 12–24 h at 4°C. Keep the plastic culture plate at 4°C for the washing steps the next day.",
    "Pause Point: The cells will be incubated in primary antibodies for 12–24 h at 4°C. This step could extend to 2 days, which may enhance the signal. However, water should be added to the chamber once or twice a day to prevent drying. The frequency depends on the humidity conditions of the surrounding environment.\nPlace the cover glasses back into the plastic culture plate. Wash the cells very gently 3 times for 20 min each in 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS at 20°C.\nNote: During the wash steps, it is advisable to avoid using a vacuum aspirator since iPSC-derived neurons are occasionally not well attached to the cover glass. Gentle pipetting using a P-1000 tip is advised.\nAdd secondary antibodies at 1:300 or 1:400 dilutions in blocking buffer for 2 h at 20°C.\nNote: Alexa conjugated antibodies may aggregate over time. To avoid adding aggregates to the samples, spin down the secondary antibody stocks before each use for 10 min, 20,000 × g, 4°C.\nWash cells 3 times for 20 min each in 0.1% Triton in 1× PBS at 20°C.\nPlace a 5–10 μL droplet of DAPI-containing Fluoromount G onto a glass slide.\nQuickly rinse the cover glasses in pure water, then invert the cover glasses onto the slides containing Fluoromount G. Remove any bubbles if necessary and allow to dry for 10 min. Once dry, seal the edges with a thin layer of clear nail polish.\nNote: Depending on the confluency and number of cell clumps, more than 10 μL of Fluoromount G may be required. Any large three-dimensional cell clumps should be removed or flattened to provide a tight seal when mounting. Background autofluorescence will occur if a tight seal is not achieved.",
    "Pause Point: Dry the slides at 20°C for 24 h in the dark, followed by long-term storage at 4°C. Image the cells within 1 week.\nImage and quantify (4+ h).\nExamine cells by confocal microscopy through a 10 μM section by Z-stack at 1 μM per section.\nUsing Image J software, outline individual cells and define them as regions of interest to be calculated individually.\nObtain Pearson's correlation values for colocalization using ImageJ software using the Coloc 2 plugin.\nCritical: The fixation and permeabilization steps of this protocol have been optimized to detect Lamp2 and GCase. The specific methods used for the permeabilization (permeabilization reagent, concentration, time) and fixation step should be adjusted and optimized for the antibody and epitope of interest.\nMeasurement of hydrolase trafficking and activity in lysosomal compartments of living cultures\nTiming: 2 days",
    "This portion of the protocol complements the preceding trafficking assays by assessing functionality of hydrolases through activity measurements, specifically within acidic cellular compartments in living cells. Hydrolase activity is measured by adding an artificial substrate into the media of living cell cultures that fluoresces upon cleavage within lysosomes. Cell-permeable substrates are available for multiple hydrolases, but the protocol below focuses on the GCase substrate, 5-(Pentafluorobenzoylamino) Fluorescein Di-β-D-Glucopyranoside (PFB – FD-Gluc). This substrate is internalized into cells within 30 min and trafficked to lysosomes through the endolysosomal system. Once cleaved by GCase, the substrate emits fluorescence at ~510 nm of the spectrum (similar to GFP or FITC) and accumulates within lysosomal compartments. Therefore, the fluorescein signal increases gradually over time as the substrate accumulates. Specific lysosomal activity is estimated by treated parallel cultures with a lysosomal inhibitor such as Bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1) that reduces lysosomal acidity. The difference between control and Baf A1 treated cultures is a measurement of hydrolase activity within acidic cellular compartments. In this case, it is safe to assume that most of this activity is lysosomal. The presence of PFB-FD-Gluc in lysosomes can be confirmed, if desired, by fixing cells treated with PFB-FD-Gluc, immunostaining with a lysosomal marker, and examining by confocal microscopy (see previous section). The PFB-FD-Gluc signal should dramatically decline in cultures treated with a GCase inhibitor, such as conduritol-β-epoxide (CBE).",
    "The advantage of this protocol is that it can assess enzymatic activity in situ, within lysosomes of living neurons. Alternative methods employ activity measurements from cell lysates, which can help determine the amount of potentially active GCase inside cells, but confounding variables may occur post-cell lysis. For example, the buffers used in lysate assays are artificially optimized for enzymatic activity, including the optimal pH and required co-factors for activity (such as sodium taurocholate, in the case of GCase). The live-cell assay described here eliminates these issues, since substrate cleavage occurs naturally within the lysosomal environment. When identifying lysosomal phenotypes in cells, this issue is critical, as many artificial factors could synergize and contribute to declined activity. In Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies, one mechanism underlying lysosomal dysfunction occurs from defects in hydrolase trafficking, where immature hydrolases accumulate within the ER or other compartments (Cuddy et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). This phenotype is difficult to detect in lysate assays since the immature enzymes stuck in the ER are still capable of substrate turnover, once liberated in a lysate and placed into an optimal buffer system in vitro. In this case, using a live-cell or in situ lysosomal activity assay is a more accurate method for detecting a deficiency that occurs from enzyme mislocalization.\nDay 1: Add dextran cascade blue to cells at a final concentration of 1 mg/mL 12–24 h before starting the activity measurements. Do not treat one or two wells; these will serve as a blank during the microplate readings.\nDay 2: Measure lysosomal activity (5 h).",
    "In a typical assay, n = 8–10 culture wells are required per condition. To half of the wells, add Baf A1 to a final concentration of 200 nM. For example, if a single well contains 100 μL media, add 11 μL of 2 μM Baf A1 to achieve 200 nM Baf A1 [final]. The control wells should get the same volume or final percentage of the vehicle (DMSO). A multi-channel pipettor will be useful here.\nNote: A complete media change can be done but is not necessary or recommended. Excessive media changes can cause loosely attached iPSC-derived neurons to lift off of the plate. Add Baf A1 directly to the wells so that treatment can be done while the dextran blue remains in the media.\nIncubate the cells for 1 h with Baf A1 and dextran blue in a tissue culture incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nAfter 1 h, aspirate off the media to remove the dextran blue. Replace with media containing the fluorescent substrate of the lysosomal enzyme being analyzed, along with DMSO or Baf A1 in the appropriate wells.\nNote: For GCase, use PFB-FD-Gluc at 100 μg/mL for 30–45 min. It is not recommended to exceed 100 μg/mL or to increase incubation time past 1 h. Be sure to replace the Baf A1 or DMSO in the appropriate wells during incubation with the fluorescent substrate.\nIncubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 45 min to allow the substrate to be fully taken up by cells and into lysosomes.",
    "Gently wash the cells once with complete media, and replace with the same media containing either DMSO or Baf A1 in the appropriate wells. The volume of media in each well should be precise between wells (including the wells used for blanks) since the volume will greatly influence the background signal in the plate reader. For iPSC-neurons, use complete Neural basal (NB) media supplemented with B27 (Thermo Fisher) or Neurocult SM1 (Stem Cell Technologies), and replace the media with 100 μL/well of SM1-NB media without PFB-FD-Gluc and phenol red. Be careful not to let the cells dry out or lift off during the media changes.\nAfter the media change, immediately read the plate in the microplate reader to get the initial fluorescent reading. Depending on the plate reader speed and number of wells to be read, this step could require 5–10 min to read through the plate.\nNote: Before starting, set the temperature of the plate reader to 37°C and assure it will read fluorescence from the bottom. Some plate readers require a plate-well adapter for bottom reading applications. Start with default sensitivity and change if necessary (6, PMT at medium). As mentioned above, default settings in the Molecular Devices Plate reader will normally read one strip in the middle, left to right. If the cells are clumped together, use a well-scan setting (in the Softmax settings) to read multiple areas of the well to reduce well-to-well error. There should be a minimal signal at time = 0 since the substrate requires approximately 30 min post-chasing time to be degraded and accumulate inside lysosomes at a detectable level. However, the dextran blue signal should be strong at t = 0 and should not change much between the initial and final readings.",
    "When the first reading is complete, cover the plate with foil to protect the cells from light and place the plate back into the incubator. Continue to read every 30 min for up to 4 h to get a full kinetic activity curve. After each read, place the cells back into a humidified tissue culture incubator. No further media changes are required.\nAfter the final read, remove the media and fix the cells in 4% PFA for 20 min. If activity is measured in neurons, staining the cells with a primary antibody for neurofilament followed by a secondary antibody IRDye800, will detect neurite degeneration. If a decline in neurofilament staining is observed, this indicates neurotoxicity in the cells that will affect results.\nSimultaneously, CellTag700 can be used as a total cell volume staining, or Draq5 to specifically stain nuclei. After a 1 h incubation at 20°C, wash the stained cells with 1× PBS and scan on an infrared imager such as the Li-cor Odyssey, Azure Sapphire, or Typhoon system. Both CellTag700 and Draq5 should indicate the total cellular material per well and can be used to normalize the lysosomal substrate signal. Even though plates should be seeded with an equal number of cells/well at the start of the experiment, normalization is required since cell numbers can change dramatically between the time the iPSC-neurons were seeded and the time of the lysosomal assay.",
    "To analyze the data, the relative fluorescent units (RFUs) of the hydrolase substrate for each time point should be normalized to either cell volume or lysosomal mass and plotted vs. time. If lysosomal mass is used, it is best to normalize the values to only the last time point collected of dextran cascade blue. The dextran fluorescence should not vary between time 0 and the final time point collected at 4 h. However, using final time point values will assure that the signal occurs from lysosomal compartments instead of endosomes and other vesicles en route to the lysosome. Once plotted, the area between the DMSO and Baf A1 curves is the “lysosomal” value (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). The remaining area under the Baf A1 curve is the activity that occurs outside of acidic subcellular compartments (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). For example, for the PFB-FD-Gluc substrate, some cleavage may occur from cytosolic GBA2 or GBA1 that is mislocalized in non-lysosomal compartments.\nThese experiments can be done to compare the effect of investigational small molecules that activate lysosomes, or to identify lysosomal phenotypes in patient-derived culture systems of lysosomal storage disorders (Kim et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Zunke and Mazzulli, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) or Parkinson's disease (Cuddy et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Mazzulli et al., 2016a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Each experiment should be done using 8–10 wells (4–5 each for DMSO and Baf A1) and 2 or 3 distinct cell passages/differentiations. If possible, the analysis should be done in a blinded manner."
