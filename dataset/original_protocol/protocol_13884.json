    "1. Synthesis of gold nanoparticle probes\nSynthesize 40 nm citrate capped gold nanoparticles, using two-steps standard seeding growth method as detailed below.\n\t\nSynthesize 15 nm citrate capped gold nanoparticles (AuNPs seeds) using the classical Turkevich–Frens method13,14.\n\t\t\nWash all glassware with aqua regia (HCl:HNO3 in a 3:1 v/v ratio).\nHeat 250 mL of 0.25 mM HAuCl4 to boil while uniformly stirring.\n\t\t\tCAUTION: HAuCl4 is corrosive and toxic.\nImmediately add 25 mL of 38.8 mM Na3∙citrate.\nContinue boiling and stirring for 30 min, while the solution turns to a red ruby color.\nRemove the solution from the heat and let cool to room temperature while stirring.\nFilter using 0.22 µm PTFE membrane syringe filters.\nStore at 4 °C in a glass bottle.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The experiment can be paused here.\nSynthesize 40 nm citrate capped gold nanoparticles (40 nm AuNPs) by seeding growth15.\n\t\t\nPrepare solution A: 390 µL of freshly prepared 0.1 M hydroxylamine sulfate with 13 mL of AuNP seeds in a total volume of 120 mL in H2O.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The amount of AuNPs seeds needed to obtain the desired size can vary; it must be titrated for each new AuNPs seed stock.\n\t\t\tCAUTION: Hydroxylamine sulfate is corrosive, toxic, mutagenic, and hazardous to the environment. For handling: Wash thoroughly after handling. Remove contaminated clothing and wash before reuse. Use with adequate ventilation. Minimize dust generation and accumulation. Avoid contact with eyes, skin, and clothing. Keep container tightly closed. Avoid breathing dust. Do not use with metal spatula or other metal items. For storage: Store in a tightly closed container. Store in a cool, dry, well-ventilated area away from incompatible substances. Keep away from metals.\nPrepare solution B: 12.25 mL of H2O + 0.25 mL of 0.1 M HAuCl4.\nLoad solution B in a syringe and load the syringe in a syringe pump.",
    "Set the syringe pump parameters: diameter of the syringe in mm; flow rate: 90 mL/h; total volume: 10.80 mL (of which, 0.8 mL are the excess needed for system equilibration, i.e., tube filling).\nStart the syringe pump. After the initial 0.8 mL of solution B have filled the tubing and dropped out to a waste container, position the tube on top of the reaction flask containing solution A (kept under moderate and uniform stirring) and let solution B enter dropwise.\nCap by adding 2.65 mL of freshly prepared 0.1 M Na3∙citrate, and stir for 5 min.\nConcentrate the obtained 40 nm AuNPs by centrifuging at 2,460 x g for 18 min at 10 °C.\nRemove the supernatant by gently aspirating. Resuspend gently in the residual volume.\nStore at 4 °C.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The experiment can be paused here.\nFunctionalize 40 nm citrate capped gold nanoparticles by standard thiol chemistry16.\n\t\nDigest disulfide bond by incubating thiolated probe oligonucleotides (5′ T(30)–(O–CH2–CH2)3–SH 3′) with 10 mM Tris(2-carboxyethil)phosphine (TCEP) at room temperature for 3 h under mild shaking (400 rpm).\nIncubate a large excess of the digested oligonucleotides overnight with 10 nM AuNPs, at room temperature under mild shaking (400 rpm).\nBring the AuNPs-DNA mixture to 0.3 M NaCl in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.01% SDS, by adding salt stepwise over a 10 h timespan, under mild shaking (400 rpm).\nIncubate overnight at room temperature under mild shaking (400 rpm).\nWash the DNA-conjugated AuNPs 3 times with 0.25 M NaCl in 10 mM phosphate buffer plus 0.01% SDS, to remove the excess unbound oligonucleotides.\nStore the obtained universal probes-AuNPs at 4 °C until use.\n\t\tNOTE: The experiment can be paused here.\nDetermine the density of DNA probes on the AuNPs using a commercial fluorescence-based assay",
    "Measure the concentration of AuNPs by UV-vis spectroscopy. In order to derive AuNPs concentration from the absorbance data, the Lambert & Beer’s Law (A=εbc) and published extinction coefficients for 40 nm AuNPs16 can be used.\nCharacterize AuNPs probes by dynamic light scattering (DLS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).\n\t\tNOTE: The experiment can be paused here.\n2. Colorimetric discrimination of BRAFV600E rare mutation\nPrepare target samples for analysis: mixtures of synthetic BRAFV600E DNA and BRAFWT DNA at different ratios (BRAFV600E:BRAFWT 1:10, 1:100, 1:200, BRAFV600E 100%, BRAFwt 100%).\nEquilibrate paramagnetic microparticles by washing them twice with hybridization buffer (HB) (1x PBS pH 7.4, 5% w/v PEG 600) and resuspend them in a volume of HB equal to the starting volume. For washing, put an aliquot of paramagnetic microparticles in a 1.5 mL tube (maximum 50 µL/tube), add 500 µL of HB and mix three times by gently pipetting, apply the magnet, separate the clear supernatant, immediately add 500 µL of HB and repeat the procedure for a second washing step. After removing the supernatant, immediately add the HB to avoid bead drying, as advised by the manufacturer.\nFor each sample to be tested, prepare a tube containing 2.5 µL of washed paramagnetic microparticles in HB.\nFunctionalize paramagnetic microparticles by incubating 2.5 µL of paramagnetic microparticles with 10 µL of a 10 µM solution of a biotinylated first discriminating probe (DP1), harboring BRAFV600E mutation, for 5 min at room temperature.\nMagnetically separate the microparticles from interfering unbound probes and resuspend them in 12.5 µL of HB. To this aim, apply the magnet to the side of the tube, and wait until the solution is transparent. Remove the solution by carefully pipetting, immediately add HB and gently pipette until the beads are homogeneously resuspended.",
    "Add to the suspension 10 µL of a 10 µM mixture of the DNA target samples described in step 2.1.\nIncubate for 30 min at room temperature.\nDuring the incubation, shake samples every 3 min to avoid sedimentation of the paramagnetic microparticles.\nAdd to the suspension 10 µL of a 2 µM solution of a second discriminating probe (DP2), designed to have a portion complementary to the target and a poly-A tail.\nIncubate for 15 min at room temperature.\nDuring the incubation, shake samples every 3 minutes to avoid sedimentation of the paramagnetic microparticles.\nMagnetically separate excess DP2 after incubation.\nAdd immediately 300 fmol of AuNPs conjugated with detection probes and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.\nMagnetically separate supernatant containing excess AuNPs and perform the 1st washing step by adding 100 µL of HB at room temperature.\nMagnetically separate the supernatant and perform a 2nd washing step by adding 100 µL of HB.\nIncubate at 52 °C for 5 min.\nMagnetically separate supernatant at 52 °C.\nResuspend immediately in 12.5 µL of HB for the readout of the colorimetric result.\nPhotograph results and store the samples at 4 °C.\nSubscription Required.
