    "Once data is collected, a single file per subject per session of raw data is obtained. Using statistical software, all sessions per subject are combined into a single file. Subsequently, the target intensity must be calculated for each subject. The adherence rate to that target intensity can then be calculated per session per subject, for each session for all subjects combined, or per group.\n1. Data Collection (carried out by personnel supervising the training session)\nMinimize electrical interference by turning off wireless devices (e.g. cell phones, Wi-Fi, etc.) and minimize crosstalk by ensuring the heart rate monitors and equipment are at least 1 meter apart. Refer to Figure 1 for placement of heart rate transmitter.\nTurn on the data tracking software. Press start on the aerobic equipment and train the participant at the target intensity. For example, in our studies, participants are asked to train within ± 5 beats/min of their target heart rate. Refer to Figure 2 for CardioMemory.\nCollect data second-by-second for each participant for each rehabilitation session. Collected data includes the following: subject ID, duration (hhmmss), level of intensity (1-30), workload (watts), pedaling speed (revolutions/minute), distance (km), pace (mm:ss/km), heart rate (beats/minute), estimated oxygen consumption (VO2, ml/min/kg), metabolic equivalent of physical effort (METs), estimated energy expenditure (kcal/hour), and estimated energy consumed (kcal). See Figure 3.\nPress stop on the aerobic equipment. Click \"save\" to upload the data to CardioMemory. Click \"export\" to save the document outside of CardioMemory. The document will be in .cvs format and will automatically include the date of the session.\n2. Data Extraction",
    "CardioMemory software does not allow for the distinction of various exercise-training phases. As such, the data obtained must be exported to a statistical software in order to eliminate the phases that are not of interest (e.g. warm-up and cool-down), merge the data files, and compare achieved against target intensity.\nOpen statistical analysis software to import excel file. Procedure: File → Open → Data → In \"Open Data\" window, select All Files in the dropdown menu of \"Files of Types\" → Select Excel. xls file → Open → In \"Opening Excel Data Source\" window click OK.\nSave the data file in a statistical analysis software. See Figure 4 for a sample database.\nEliminate the nontraining phases, i.e. warm-up and cool-down, if the interest is time spent at the target intensity during the training phase.\n\t\nEliminate warm-up phase (e.g. first 10 min):\n\t\t\nTo recode duration, create a variable to identify every second as 1.
