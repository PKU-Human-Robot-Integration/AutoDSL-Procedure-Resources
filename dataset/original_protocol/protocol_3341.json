    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMyoblast isolation: Removal of muscle\nTiming: 30 min\nThe below offers a basic text for the isolation of myoblast.\nFollowing IACUC guidelines, euthanize mice.\nCollect muscle tissue from the gastrocnemius, quadriceps, soleus, and hamstring muscles in both legs at 4–8 weeks of age from 4–6 mice.\nNote: Less or more mice can be utilized but we generally found batches of 4–6 to be a good quantity.\nCritical: This protocol works to make tissue-type specific cell lines. If the muscle types will not be combined, double the number of mice, to 8–12 mice, to ensure an adequate sample count.\nTransfer the collected tissue to an Eppendorf tube.\nNote: From this point on, ensure a sterile environment is utilized.\nMyoblast isolation: Preparation of muscle, shaking, and grinding of tissue\nTiming: 2.5 h\nWash isolated tissue 2–3 times with the initial PBS wash mixture.\nNote: The PBS solution is prepared right before dissecting the tissue.\nIncubate muscle tissue in the initial DMEM-F12 incubation mixture.\nCritical: Avoid filtering the DMEM-F12 media containing collagenase, 1% pen/strep, and 3 μL/mL Fungizone. This initial DMEM-F12 incubation mixture must be chilled (4°C) when added to reduce temperature shock.\nMaintain the muscle solution in a 37°C water bath for 10–15 min.\nShake at 220 rpm, for an overall time of 1.5 h.\nAfter incubation, wash the tissue 3–4 times with PBS.\nIncubate in warmed secondary DMEM-F12 incubation mixture while the tissue is shaken for 30 min in a 37°C water bath.\nNote: Secondary DMEM-F12 incubation mixture has to be pre-warmed to 37°C to ensure efficient mixing of dispase and since the muscles were at 37°C after incubation.\nAfter shaking, grind tissue with a mortar and pestle in the presence of liquid nitrogen.\nPass through a 100 μm, then 70 μm, cell strainer.",
    "Centrifuge the solution at 1000 rpm/27 rcf for 5 min to pellet the cells. Avoid doing longer for this step (see Problem #1)\nMyoblast isolation: Plating\nTiming: 1–3 h\nThe protocol below offers details to isolate myoblasts through plates.\nTransfer the to a plate and resuspended using DMEM-F12 growth media supplemented with 40 ng/mL bFGF.\nPre-plate the cells for 1–3 h on UNCOATED dishes to reduce the number of fibroblasts.\nCritical: Fibroblasts can dilute satellite cells. Recommended for dystrophic or injured muscle. Pre-plating on an uncoated plate causes fibroblasts to stick and be isolated (see Problem #2). Fibroblasts can separately be used to isolate and for other experiments.\nDilute cells 1:15 in PBS, then plate in a Matrigel-coated dish.\nNote: To create Matrigel-coated dishes, dilute stock concentration (while keeping on ice) to 1:15 in sterile PBS in the hood. Put Matrigel solution on flask/plate, shake/tilt to coat the bottom, incubate at 22°C (room temperature) in a chemical hood for 30 min, and remove Matrigel solution back into its original tube. Matrigel solution may be reused up to 5 times in total.\nMyoblast isolation: Differentiation\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nThe below protocol offers subsequent differentiation to myotubes, if desired.\nWait for activation, which takes 24–48 h, after which myoblasts will grow rapidly.\nTo maintain healthy myoblast cells, use the growth media supplemented with bFGF (10 ng/mL).\nCritical: Use Differentiation Medium to go from myoblasts to myocytes and then to myotubes (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nPlate primary myoblast at ∼.8 × 106 cells per well and to differentiate the cells, add differentiation media, supplemented with 1:10,000 bFGF.\nNote: This will depend on # of cell passages and type of treatment, adjust accordingly.\nIncubate for 4–7 days for differentiation to myotubes.\nNote: Switch out with fresh differentiation media every 2 days, supplemented with 1:10,000 bFGF.",
    "Cells are split using 2–5 mL of accutase for 5–15 min, dependent on cell count.\nOptional: 3 days after differentiation, infect myotubes with GFP-expressing adenovirus per previous procedures,16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16] if imaged with light microscopy.\nNote:  DO NOT use trypsin to split the cells. Accutase is less harsh to the extracellular matrix, surface proteins, and cytoskeleton of skeletal cells than trypsin, so it is highly preferred.20[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20] Accutate total incubation time and volume will differ depending on cell yield (see Problem #3).\nCells are maintained in (5% CO2) at 37°C. If growing myotubes, a confluency of 70%–85% has to be reached prior to adding growth media.\nValidation day 1: Permeabilization and blocking\nTiming: 1.5 h\nImmunofluorescence staining is effective for examining differences in skeletal muscles simultaneously. Refer to Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for a list of validated primary antibodies for skeletal muscles. Select secondary antibodies that are compatible with the epifluorescence or confocal microscope available to you.\nCritical: All steps are performed at 22°C (room temperature) unless otherwise indicated.\nNote: This protocol for Immunofluorescence staining and antibody validation of isolated skeletal muscle cells is an adaptation of Esper et al., skeletal muscle tissue immunofluorescence labeling protocol.21[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]\nFix cells by incubating them in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 5 min.\nWash three times for 5 min using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nNote: Ice-cold 100% methanol or acetone is an effective fixative for cryosections and more suited for some antigens. Acetone is less harsh than methanol.\nIncubate cells in permeabilization buffer for 10 min.\nIncubate cells in blocking solution for 1 h at 22°C (room temperature) or up to 18 h overnight at 4°C.",
    "Note: When using permeabilization buffer, keep the solution away from the hydrophobic barrier to avoid loss of hydrophobicity. If this happens, wash the slide well with PBS. Include Mouse on Mouse (MOM) blocking reagent at a 1:40 dilution when staining mouse tissue with antibodies raised in the mouse.\nValidation day 2: Antibodies\nTiming: 30 min\nTo begin immunostaining, dilute the primary and secondary antibodies in a blocking solution according to the manufacturer’s suggested ratio.\nNote: It is acceptable to dilute antibodies in hybridoma supernatant when targeting multiple antigens.\nAspirate the blocking buffer and cover the slide with the primary antibody solution.\nIncubate the slides for up to 18 h (overnight) at 4°C.\nValidation day 3: Preparing slides for imaging\nTiming: 2–3 h\nThis final day prepares slides for imaging prior to final imaging, although imaging may be performed on this same day.\nOn the following day, wash three times for 5 min with PBS.\nAfter washing, cover cells with secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h at 22°C (room temperature) in the dark.\nNote: Keep slides in the dark for the remainder of the protocol.\nAfter incubation, wash the slides three times for 5 min with PBS.\nIncubate the cells with 1 μg/mL DAPI diluted in PBS for 5 min.\nWash once with PBS for 5 min.\nAspirate the PBS and place 1–2 drops of mounting media onto the cells\nCarefully place a coverslip on the slide, while avoiding air bubbles.\nLet the slides dry in the dark for 1–2 h before sealing the slides with clear nail polish.\nStore the slides at 4°C and image within 2 weeks.\nLight microscopy studies\nTiming: 2–6 h",
    "All imaging experiments were performed at Central Microscopy Research Facility, University of Iowa, while adenoviruses were obtained from University of Iowa Viral Vector Core facility.\nPlate myotubes on 35 mm dishes with a glass bottom and imaged for light microscopy.\nPerform staining of myotubes on Olympus IX-81 (done in this protocol) or equivalent.\nSeahorse analyzer studies\nTiming: 2–3 days\nThis is a well-reported procedure that may be found in more depth per established protocols.16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16],22[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22] Oxygen consumption rate was measured for using an XF24 bioanalyzer (Seahorse Bioscience: North Billerica, MA, USA), as previously described.16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16],22[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]\nPlate Myotubes and myoblasts at a density of 20 × 103 per well and differentiate for 3 days (in step by step above).\nTreat isolated myotubes and myoblasts with 10 nmol/L insulin for the specified time.15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]\nReplace media with XF-DMEM (supplemented with 1 g/L D-Glucose, 0.11 g/L sodium pyruvate, and 4 mM L-Glutamine) and deprive cells of CO2 for 60 min.\nPerform oligomycin (1 μg/mL), carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP; 1 μM), rotenone (1 μM), and antimycin A (10 μM) treatment. For quantifications, time points 1–3 measure basal respiration, or baseline rate of oxygen consumption by cells in culture without any treatment. Add Oligomycin (1 μg/mL) to inhibit ATP synthase, which reduces mitochondrial respiration and leads to an increase in proton gradient, to measure the amount of oxygen consumed by the myoblasts and myotubes to maintain the proton gradient in time points 4–6. Add carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP; 1 μM) in time points 7–9, which allows electrons to flow freely through the electron transport chain allowing for measurements of reserve capacity and maximum oxygen consumption. Finally, add rotenone (1 μM) and antimycin A (10 μM) in time points 10–12, which inhibit electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone and ubiquinol to cytochrome c, respectively, to measure non-mitochondrial respiration.23[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]",
    "For normalization of proteins, after measurement, add 20 μL of 10 mM Tris with 0.1% Triton X-100 at pH 7.4 to lyse cells per prior protocols,22[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22] and replace with 480 μL of Bradford reagent.\nTransmission electron microscopy\nTiming: 2–3 days\nThis is a well-reported procedure that may be found in more depth per established protocols.17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17],24[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]\nOnce Myoblasts and myotubes are isolated according to the step-by-step above, place them in six-well poly-D-lysine-coated plates for TEM processing per established protocols.17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17],24[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24].\nFix cells by incubating at 37°C with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer for 1 h.\nRinse twice with 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, prior to fixation at 22°C (room temperature) for 30 min to 1 h using 1% osmium tetroxide and 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer.\nWash samples for 5 min with 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (7.3 pH), then diH2O (2 × 5 min).\nIncubate samples with 2.5% uranyl acetate, diluted with H2O, at 4°C for up to 18 h (overnight).\nDehydrate samples and replace ethanol with Eponate 12 mixed in 100% ethanol in a 1:1 solution for 30 min at RT. Repeat three times for 1 h using 100% Eponate 12, replace media, and cure in an oven at 70°C for up to 18 h (overnight).\nAfter cracking and submerging the plate in liquid nitrogen, use an 80 nm thickness jeweler’s saw to cut the block to fit in a Leica UC6 ultramicrotome sample holder.\nFrom there, place sections section on formvar-coated copper grids.\nCounterstain grids in 2% uranyl acetate for 2 min and Reynold’s lead citrate for 2 min.\nAcquire by TEM on either a JEOL JEM-1230, operating at 120 kV, or a JEOL 1400, operating at 80 kV (used for these representative data), our equivalent.",
