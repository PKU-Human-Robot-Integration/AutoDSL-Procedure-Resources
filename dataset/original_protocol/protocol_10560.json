    "1. Sample Preparation\nMaintain CHOK1 cells in tissue culture flasks using DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 I.U/ml of penicillin 50 µg/ml of streptomycin. Incubate the cells in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C.\nHarvest and then plate CHOK1 cells on a 14 mm diameter micro-well with a surface thickness of 0.16 mm. Seed cells for optimal density for imaging, around 60-70% confluency.\nIncubate cells overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Wash the cells three times in HBSS (Hank Buffered Saline Solution), and incubate cells in a solution containing 50 nM of Lysotracker DND26 green and 150 nM of tubulin tracker green. Incubate cells for 1 hr at 37 °C. Optional step: Prior to incubation, perform an additional stain with a mitochondrial matrix staining dye (25 nM).\nWash the cells three times in HBSS to remove any unbound dye. Add fresh DMEM growth medium prior to imaging the cells.\n2. Microscope Configurations\nThe microscope for the particle tracking described in the video protocol is assembled on the frame of a commercially available inverted microscope (Figure 4). However commercial modules for 3D orbital particle tracking are now available.\nUse a Coherent Chameleon-Ultra II Ti:Sa femtosecond laser excitation light source, with a tunable output wavelength range between 690 nm-1,040 nm.\nEnsure that the laser beam is aligned in the rear port of the microscope using IR-coated mirrors. The laser beam is attenuated using a rotating half-wave plate followed by a calcite linear polarizer. Attenuate the beam so that the average power at the sample is between 0.5 and 2 mW.",
    "NOTE: The laser beam is reflected by a pair of galvanometer-motor actuated mirrors that allow control of the position and trajectory of the focused beam in the sample plane. In a typical configuration the collimated laser beam exiting of the galvanometer mirrors is expanded (10X) passing through a beam expander, before entering the rear of the microscope objective after reflection on short-pass dichroic mirror.\nCollect the fluorescence light from the sample by placing a high numerical aperture water objective (60X, NA 1.2) into the light path. Choose a fluorescence filter cube according to the desired emission wavelengths in either one or two channel configuration. Employ emission bandpass filters to further select the spectral range of the emitted fluorescence.\nPlace the sample onto a motorized stage, and adjust the fine motion of the microscope objective using an objective piezo-controller.\nDirect the light from the filter cube into photomultiplier tubes where the signal is discriminated and sent to a digital I/O data acquisition card.\n\tNOTE: Computer generated waveforms are the analog output of the I/O card and are provided to the scanners control electronics. The photon counting input from the photomultipliers and the output signal to the scanners are measured and controlled via the I/O card by the Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics SimFCS software.\n3. Imaging\nPosition the cells on the stage and focus using transmitted light illumination.\nSwitch to raster scan imaging to identify the cells that have incorporated the dye and to visualize the underlying microtubules. Identify the initial area where vesicle movement is present.\nOnce an isolated vesicle is identified, set the following parameters for orbital tracking:",
    "Select the radius of the orbit to define the size of the circular scan according to the size of the particle being tracked. For a point emitter, set the radius of the orbit equal to the waist of the Point Spread Function (PSF) of the excitation beam to maximize sensitivity and response.\nSet the axial distance to define the distance between the two orbits that are performed to localize the particle position along the axial direction. Set the axial distance to 1.5-3 times the PSF waist.\nDefine the dwell time according to the brightness of the particle to set the time spent on each point of the orbit, which will also determine the photo-bleaching rate. Use a dwell time between 10-100 µsec.\nSet the number of points in each orbit to 64 or 128 to yield orbit periods in the order of 4-32 msec and provide a high temporal resolution for determining the particle position.\nChange the DC offset signal sent to the mirrors in order to center the beam on the particle through the graphical user interface via a cursor selection in the raster-scanned image.\nBegin tracking by switching the microscope mode from raster-imaging to orbital scanning.\nActivate the feedback and data collection.\n4. Trajectory Analysis\nUse the software to display the fluorescence collected at each point along the orbit and at each time point in the form of an ‘intensity carpet’. The intensity collected along the carpet provides information on the interaction of the particle with other bright objects. Use the software to display both the trajectory information (i.e. the DC displacement over time of the x,y scanners and of the z-piezo) as well as the fluorescence intensity collected from the photomultiplier tube over time in the form of time series.",
    "Use the time series representation and the ‘intensity carpet’ information to select only a region of interest in the trajectory.\nUse the software to display a 2D projection of the selected portion of the particle trajectory. Select the appropriate controls to color-code the trajectory according to the particle fluorescence intensity.\nSelect the option to display the particle trajectory in 3D, and color-code it according to the fluorescence intensity. Rotate the trajectory in 3D using the controls to visualize the features of the lysosome motion along the microtubule.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
