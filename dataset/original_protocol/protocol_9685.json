    "Human aortic specimens were utilized for primary HASMC isolation under the approval of Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University Ethics Committee (NO. B2020-158). Aortic specimens were collected from patients who underwent ascending aorta surgery at Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before participation.\n1. Primary human aortic smooth muscle cell isolation\nWash the right lateral region of the ascending aorta with sterile PBS, 1x-2x.\nRemove the intima and adventitia layers of the tissue with two ophthalmic forceps and retain the media layer to harvest the cells.\nPlace the media layer onto a 10 cm culture dish and cut it into small pieces (2-3 mm) with scissors. Add 5 mL of smooth muscle cell culture medium (SMCM) containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.\nMove the small tissue into the culture bottle with a sterile dropper, spreading the tissue evenly. Discard the culture medium as much as possible, then invert the bottle upside down.\nAdd 2 mL of SMCM into the inverted culture bottle and place it in the incubator (5% CO2) at 37 °C for 1-2 h, then slowly turn it right side up and add another 2 mL of SMCM.\nAfter 5-7 days of incubation, exchange the SMCM with 4 mL of fresh SMCM. Generally, sporadic smooth muscle cells climb out in approximately 2 weeks.\nSlowly discard the SMCM and add it slowly when changing the medium. Transport the culture bottle slowly when moving to a microscope station; otherwise, the tissues will float, and the cells will grow slowly.\nWhen the cells reach approximately 80% confluency, wash with 2 mL of PBS, digest with 2 mL of 0.25% trypsin, and divide them into two new culture bottles with 4 mL of fresh SMCM.",
    "Identify the cells through an immunofluorescence analysis of four different specific markers for smooth muscle cells (CNN1, SM22)14.\n2. Preparation of PDMS chip\nTo polymerize PDMS, add curing agent (B component) to base (A component) at a weight ratio of A: B = 10:1 w/w and mix the complex completely for 5 min; the volume depends on the need of the study.\nPlace the prepared PDMS gel in a vacuum extraction tank for 30-60 min and maintain the pressure below -0.8 mPa.\n\tNOTE: High pressure will lead to insufficient extraction of small bubbles inside the PDMS gel that will affect the next step of chip fabrication.\nUsing computer-aided design (CAD) software, design the mold with a 100 mm × 40 mm × 8 mm external frame structure and a 70 mm × 6 mm × 4 mm channel.\nCustom make the molds of the three layers using a high-precision computer numerical control engraving machine. Carve out the frame of the molds and the microchannels using polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) plates, and then glue them onto another PMMA plate.\nPour the prepared PDMS gel onto a mold with a 100 mm × 40 mm × 6 mm outer frame and 70 mm × 6 mm × 4 mm channel, and then cross-link at 70 °C for 1-2 h.\nPeel off the cross-linked PDMS slabs from the mold and cut the commercialized PDMS membranes into 100 mm × 40 mm sections.\nTreat the three prepared PDMS slabs and two PDMS membranes with oxygen plasma for 5 min for PDMS surface activation. Apply the following specific settings: room air as the process gas; pressure set to -100 kPa; current set to 180--200 Ma; voltage set to 200 V; process time to 5 min.",
    "Punch holes on the three PDMS slabs using a 1 mm hole puncher to make the inlet and outlet of air and medium microchannels on the PDMS chip.\nBond three PDMS slabs and two PDMS membranes together in the order: air channel PDMS slab (top layer) - PDMS membrane - medium channel PDMS slab (middle layer) - PDMS membrane- air channel PDMS slab (bottom layer). Perform this step under a stereoscopic microscope at 4x to fully overlap the air microchannels with the medium microchannels.\nPlace the assembled PDMS chip in a 70 °C incubator for 1 h.\nPrepare several 1 mm inner diameter and 3 cm length latex hoses. Insert a 1 mm outer diameter and 1 cm long stainless-steel needle into one end of the prepared hose, and then insert a Luer into the other end of the hose to create the tube connected to the air and medium microchannels of the PDMS chip.\nInsert the prepared tubes into the outlets and inlets of the air and medium microchannels on the PDMS chip.\n3. PDMS chip surface treatment and sterilization\nInfuse 2 mL of 80 mg/mL mouse collagen into the medium microchannel of the PDMS chip using a 2 mL syringe and incubate at room temperature for 30 min.\nAfter incubation, remove the collagen from the channel and recollect with a 2 mL syringe. Place the collagen-coated PDMS chips in a 60 °C incubator overnight.\nPlace the PDMS chips in a UV sterilizer for more than 1 h. Place the sterilized PDMS chips on an ultraclean bench in preparation for the cell experiment.\n4. Cell seeding on the PDMS chip and cell stretching process",
    "Culture 4 x 105 primary human smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) from patients using smooth muscle cell medium (SMCM) containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in an 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C.\nWhen the HASMC density reaches 80%, discard the SMCM and wash the cells with 2 mL of PBS.\nDigest the cells using 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin for 2 min and centrifuge at 100 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of fresh SMCM. Use 8 mL of SMCM to culture the cells on a 10 cm culture dish.\nCalculate the cell number using a cytometer and use the cells at a final concentration of 2 x 105 cells/mL.\nSlowly pour 2 mL of PBS into the collagen-coated and sterilized PDMS chip medium microchannel and later discard using a 2 mL syringe.\nSlowly pour a total of 2 mL of 2 x 105 cells/mL HASMC suspension into the medium microchannel of the PDMS chip using a 2 mL syringe. Then, close the Luer at the entrance and exit of the PDMS chip. Place the PDMS chip in an incubator (5% CO2) at 37 °C for 1 day.\nAfter the cells are attached to the PDMS membrane in the PDMS chip, nearly after 24 h, connect the outlet of the air microchannel on the PDMS chip to the vacuum controller system. When the cell is attached, an elongated, normal cellular form can be seen under the microscope, contrasting with the suspended round cells.\nTurn on the solenoid valve and the vacuum pump. Open the vacuum regulator and adjust the pressure level to 10 kPa for 7.18 ± 0.44% strain and 15 kPa for 17.28 ± 0.91% strain.",
    "After the parameters of the control system are set, place the PDMS chips in an incubator (5% CO2) at 37 °C and stretch for 24 h.\n5. Preparation of the mechanical control system\nPrepare several solenoid valves, vacuum filters, vacuum regulators, a vacuum pump, a peristaltic pump, and a programmable logic controller (PLC) controlling the solenoid valve.\nProgram the PLC controller and set the on/off time interval to 1 Hz. Connect the solenoid valves to the programmed controller.\nConnect the inlet of the vacuum pump to the vacuum filters, and then connect the outlet of the vacuum filters to the vacuum regulators. Connect the outlet of the vacuum regulators to solenoid valves, and finally, connect the outlet of the solenoid valves to the outlets of the air microchannels of the PDMS chips.\nConnect the outlet of the peristaltic pump to the inlet of the medium microchannel of the PDMS chip and the inlet of the peristaltic pump to the outlet of the medium microchannel PDMS chip for culture medium replacement and drug handling.\nAdjust the amplitude of the strain by the regulator and the strain frequency by the microcontroller.\nSubscription Required.
