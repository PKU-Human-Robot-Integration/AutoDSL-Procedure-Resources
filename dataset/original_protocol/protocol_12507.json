    "1. The Oxford Paddling Pools\nThe paddling pool has been made according to three successive designs, Mk 1-3. All employ shallow (2 cm) water contained in a white (to enhance its aversiveness) base, which is surrounded by transparent walls made of Perspex or clear acrylic plastic. These have true/false exits set in them. The false exits are occluded by black painted wooden plugs, whereas the true exit is open and joined to a black plastic pipe which can be removed with the mouse inside. The mouse is then swiftly and atraumatically returned to its home cage while inside the pipe. After the first publication of the paddling pool, it was reported that return to the home cage was also an effective motivator for learning the Lashley III maze2.\nA water temperature of 20-25 °C is used. 20-21 °C is ideal; it has been noted that some mice seem less motivated at higher temperatures.\nThe first maze5 was circular. However, sometimes mice (particularly those with lesions to the hippocampus) would appear not to notice the open exit tube. An octagonal design, with the exit tubes placed in the corners so as to attract the attention of the mice, greatly ameliorated this problem. However, the error rate at chance performance would be 4/trial, as opposed to 6/trial with the 12-tube circular design. Therefore a dodecagonal pool is now used with 11 false and 1 true exit set in the angles made by the junctions of the walls.\n1.1. Evolution and characteristics of the paddling pools\nMk 1: a circular pool 85 cm in diameter with 12 true/false exits (Figure 1).\nMk 2: an octagonal pool 86 cm in diameter with 8 true/false exits set in the corners.",
    "Mk 3: a dodecagonal (12 sided) pool 120 cm in diameter with 12 true/false exit set in the corners (Figure 4).\nIn all the above (and the paddling Y-maze; see below) the exit tubes were 40 mm diameter. However, it was occasionally sensed that the mice were reluctant to enter these, and control performance in the Y-maze would sometimes dip after they had been responding well. Therefore, and considering how readily they entered the burrowing apparatus (see JOVE publication \"Assessing burrowing, nest construction and hoarding in mice\"), also that the exit holes in the Barnes maze are 50 mm diameter, it was considered if 40 mm was too small. A test was carried out in the home cage of six C57BL/6 mice. (They seem more ready to enter 40 mm tubes in the home cage as presumably stress is lower here than in a piece of apparatus, so doing the test in the home cage would minimize differences in entry if the smaller tubes were slightly aversive, making the test more conservative). Two 40 mm tubes and two 50 mm tubes were placed on the floor in an alternating pattern. As predicted, there were more entries into 50 mm tubes (28 entries) than 40 mm (9 entries). Therefore pilot tests are planned on a new Y-maze with 50 mm exit tubes; if this is successful the old 40 mm tubes on the dodecagonal pool and paddling Y-maze will be replaced with new 50 mm ones.\nAs the paddling pool, paddling Y-maze and spatial novelty Y-maze are all spatial tests, relying on the room cues which the mouse sees through the transparent walls of the apparatus, the room should be well furnished with distinctive cues (e.g shelves, cupboards, black plastic shapes on the walls).\n2. Running the Paddling Pool",
    "Place a mouse in the center of the pool facing one of four positions on the perimeter (9, 12 or 3 o'clock if the escape tube is at 6 o'clock). Placement is semi-random; a maximum of three consecutive trials can be in the same direction. This can be difficult to achieve in practice, because as learning proceeds the mice tend to orientate themselves towards the correct exit as they are lowered into the pool by the tail. If they do this strongly no attempt should be made to force them into the planned position, since they are simply demonstrating learning.\nRelease them when they are just above the water, as then they drop in and instantly know that they are no longer being held. Slowly releasing them results in them struggling to free themselves and this can impair initial orientation. This also applies to the paddling Y-maze.",
    "Maximum trial length is 60 sec. If the mouse fails to escape by then, manually guide it to the exit using a couple of clear Perspex paddles, each measuring about 30 x 20 cm. The measures taken are the time to find the exit (definition: all of the head within the tube) and errors. Errors were defined as coming within a head's length from a tube (including the real exit). Passing close by the real exit, without entry, generally occurs infrequently after the first few trials. Although a case can be made that this is a problem, an alternative view is that mice impaired in spatial cognition do this because they don't know there is an exit around there. Controls do know, and therefore investigate more fully. A ceiling of 11 errors/trial is imposed on the number of errors in the analysis, to prevent too much skew of the data. This would mitigate against a deficit being found in spatially impaired mice, i.e. it is a conservative measure. Mice which fail to reach the exit within 60 sec are assigned a score of 11 errors for that trial. So 60 sec times always have 11 errors.\n3. The Paddling Y-maze",
    "To simplify the paddling pool procedure and the apparatus it was decided to experiment with a Y-maze, operated according to the same principles as the paddling pools. The apparatus consists of three arms made of transparent polystyrene or Perspex, each 30 x 8 x 20 cm. This is mounted on a white base (Figure 7). White was chosen to maximize the aversiveness of the floor color and so encourage escape from the shallow (2 cm deep). As in the water maze, there is only one true exit, with the other two arms terminating in false exits which look the same from inside the maze (Figure 8).\nRunning the paddling Y-maze\nPlace a mouse at the end of one of the closed arms, facing away from the center. The sequence of arms chosen as the starting position is defined by a semi-random sequence; no more than three consecutive trials with the same position, and equal numbers of the left or right arms. Each trial lasts 60 sec. If the mouse fails to exit (whole head in exit tube) within this time encourage it to enter the arm with the aid of a piece of transparent Perspex. The exit arm's base is blocked by the Perspex and the mouse allowed to finds the exit by itself; this should encourage better learning than pushing it right into the tube. But this may need to be resorted to if the mouse is reluctant to enter the tube after 15 sec. Take measures of the total time to exit and the number of errors (whole body excluding tail enters a blind arm).\nScoring the paddling Y-maze",
    "There are two definitions of a correct trial: firstly one in which the mouse finds the exit in <60 sec and makes no entries into blind arms, with errors being scored if blind arms are entered and/or if the exit is not found within 60 sec. This analysis confounds failures to start moving with errors in arm entries. Secondly, a trial analysis that emphasizes cognitive ability can be performed by excluding, for each mouse, all trials where the mouse did not leave the start arm within 60 sec, (i.e. delete all 0+60 scores) then calculating the % correct of the remaining trials.\n4. Two types of Y-maze Combined\n1. Apparatus\nWhen building a paddling Y-maze, it is useful to incorporate two doors to enable it to be run as a (dry) spatial novelty memory experiment 6 (Figure 13). A transparent guillotine door covers the exit hole in the end wall of the exit arm, while an opaque guillotine door can be inserted to seal of one arm from the other two during the sampling phase of the test. It is important that the runners for these doors are not within reach of the mice, as otherwise they may divert their attention because they appear potential escape routes. Ideally they should extend 7 cm down from the top of the maze wall.\n2. Set-up\nPlace a thin (0.5 cm) layer of wood chip bedding material on the floor of the Y-maze. This is redistributed between the two test phases for individual mice, and between mice. For best practice, to make the olfactory environment more similar for the first versus subsequent mice, place one or two non-experimental mice in the maze for a few minutes before the experiment starts.\n3. Procedure",
    "With the exit arm blocked off by the opaque door and its exit hole blocked by the transparent door, place the mouse in the start arm (one of the two non-exit arms of the maze) and allow it to explore for 5 min. Then remove it, raise the opaque door to allow access to all three arms, replace it in the start arm and observe it for 2 min. Note the number of entries and the time spent in each arm. Control mice should remember that the first two arms, and spend more time in the previously inaccessible arm."
