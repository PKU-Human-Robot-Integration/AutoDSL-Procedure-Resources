    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMouse ventricular myocyte isolation and preparation\nTiming: 1–2 h\nNote: Preheat the water bath (Model 9105, Fisher Scientific, USA) of the Langendorff apparatus to 37°C.\nMouse anesthesia. Inject 80 mg/kg of ketamine and 5 mg/kg of xylazine to adult mice (both male and female, 12–16 weeks) intraperitoneally. Assess level of anesthesia by firm toe pinch.\nInject 300 USP unit sodium heparin intraperitoneally.\nPerform a midline thoracotomy and heart excision.\nTransfer the heart to a petri dish containing ice-cold Ca2+-free Tyrode’s solution.\nTrim the connective tissues using a fine scissor.\nCannulate the heart through aorta onto a Langendorff apparatus prefilled with Ca2+-free Tyrode’s solution, gassed with 100% O2. Retrogradely perfuse the heart with the Ca2+-free Tyrode’s solution at 37°C, circulated by a perfusion pump (MasterFlex, Cole Parmer Instrument Co., USA).\nWashout the blood by perfusion for 3 min, and adjust the perfusion speed at a flow rate of 4–6 mL/min and control the initial pressure at ≈75 mmHg using a pressure monitor (BP-1, World Precision Instruments, USA) connected to the Langendorff apparatus. Switched the perfusion solution to Ca2+-free Tyrode’s solution containing collagenase type II (0.8 mg/mL) for digestion of the tissue.\nContinuous monitoring of the declining perfusion pressure for 15–20 min during tissue digestion by collagenase type II, until the pressure is below 30 mmHg. Check the color of the heart surface, and the softness of heart tissue to determine the digestion level.\nPerfuse the heart with high potassium solution for 3 min. The high potassium solution depolarizes the membrane potentials of cardiomyocytes to allow cardiomyocytes and cardiac tissues to become less excitable.\nRemove the heart from the perfusion apparatus and transfer to a petri dish containing high potassium solution. Mince the left ventricle and mechanically dissociate the tissue to obtain the cardiomyocytes by pipetting.",
    "Harvest single isolated cardiomyocytes by filtering through nylon mesh cell strainer (100 μm) and store the cell in high potassium solution at room temperature for recording. The cardiomyocytes in high potassium solution will be quiescent and can be stored for 6–8 h.\nWhole-cell patch-clamp recordings\nTiming: 4–8 h\nRecording glass patch pipette preparation. Pull borosilicate glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments, TW150F-4) to make glass patch pipette with a P-97 micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA), and polish the pipette tip with a microforge (Narishige MF-830, Tokyo, Japan). The resistance of the electrodes is 1.5–3.0 MΩ when filled with the pipette solution.\nCritical: To minimize pipette capacitance, pipettes should be filled with a small amount of internal solution and relatively thicker wall glass capillaries should be used. Coating the pipette tip with a layer of SYLARDTM 184 (Dow Corning) will also reduce the pipette capacitance.\nSet the voltage-clamp protocol. In Clampex 10 software, set the stair voltage protocol ranging from −140 to +100 mV with 10-mV increment as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1102-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Nonlinear capacitance (NLC) in ventricular myocytes from WT and Slc26a5−/− mice\n(A) The voltage stair protocol used for NLC recordings.\n(B) Representative traces of capacitive currents recorded from WT and Slc26a5−/− cardiomyocytes at baseline (left panels), after application of 25 μM blebbistatin (BLEB, middle panels) and 10 mM BDM (right panels).

    "(C) Normalized NLC as a function of voltage. The data is fitted with the first derivative of Boltzmann function. 10 mM salicylate is applied to inhibit the NLC as shown in the left panel (n=6 for WT, and n=5 for Slc26a5−/−). In the presence of salicylate, Qmax /Cln for WT cardiomyocytes is significantly reduced, while Qmax /Cln for Slc26a5−/− cardiomyocytes is not significantly altered. NLC for WT and Slc25a5−/− at baseline are shown in dotted lines in the middle and right panels. The NLC of Slc26a5−/− myocytes at -20, -10, 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 mV in the presence of BLEB or BDM is significantly smaller than that in the absence of BLEB and BDM (p<0.05). Reprinted with permission from (Zhang et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Data represent mean ± SEM.\nPatch-clamp recordings. Seed cardiomyocytes in a recording chamber with a volume size of 0.5 mL connected to a gravity driven solution perfusion system. The perfusion speed is kept at 1–2 mL/min.\nCritical: To minimize pipette capacitance, the solution level is kept low to reduce the depth of the pipette immersion.\nConnect the recording chamber with the silver/silver chloride ground electrode by a 3 M KCl agar bridge.\nFive minutes after seeding the cells, healthy cardiomyocytes will attach to the cover glass of the recording chamber, and the perfusion of the solution will wash away the unhealthy and dead cells.\nUse a square 5 mV test pulse with a holding potential of 0 mV for seal test, and form a seal with a resistance larger than ten giga-ohm.\nAfter giga-ohm seal formation, compensate the pipette capacitance in cell-attached mode by adjusting “Fast” and “Slow” pipette capacitance compensation knobs of the amplifier to minimize the pipette capacitive currents.",
    "After rupturing the membrane in whole-cell configuration with a seal resistance of at least one giga-ohm, hold the membrane potential at 0 mV.\nWith continuous perfusion, perform whole-cell recordings at room temperature (21°C–22°C) to record the capacitive currents using the voltage stair protocol and an Axopatch 200A amplifier, Digidata 1440 digitizer, and pClamp10 software (Molecular Devices, LLC., Sunnyvale, CA). The recordings are digitally filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 2 kHz.\nPharmacological interventions. To separate the NLC component resulting from prestin function, use bath solution containing 10 mM salicylate to perfuse the cells for 3 min, and then record the salicylate-sensitive capacitive currents during perfusion.\nNote: 10 mM salicylate is used for effective NLC inhibition in outer hair cells with a half-maximal concentration of 1.6 mM (Kakehata and Santos-Sacchi, 1996[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Zheng et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). The salicylate inhibitory effect on NLC is shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C, left panel.\nNote: During the capacitive current recordings, we also add two different excitation-contraction (EC) uncouplers, 25 μM blebbistatin (BLEB) or 10 mM 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM) to the bath solution for 3 min to inhibit the myosin ATPase to disengage cellular excitation from contraction (Bond et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), and then record the capacitive currents during perfusion.\nAnalyses of NLC using biophysical and mathematical methods\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nUse pClamp 10, Microsoft Excel, Origin 6.1, and GraphPad Prism software to analyze the capacity currents.",
    "Determine total membrane capacitance (Cm) by analyzing the capacitive currents and measuring the input resistance (Rin) at each step voltage (Vc). Cm=(Rin/Rm)2Q/Vc, where Rin (Rin = Rm+Rs) is the input resistance which can be determined by the steady state current and Vc; Rm is membrane resistance, Rs is the series resistance which can be calculated by the time constant (τ) of the capacitor discharge current, the charge movement (Q), step voltage and Rin (Rs= τVcRin/(QRin+τVc)).\nNote: As part of Rs, the pipette resistance has been considered and accounted for in determining the Cm from the experimental data, and will not affect the quantification of NLC due to pipette resistance changes in different recordings.\nDetermine the NLC. Cm= Cln + Cv, where Cln is the linear capacitance, and Cv is the nonlinear capacitance. Normalized NLC can be expressed as [Cm- Cln]/ Cln. Cv is described as a function of voltage and fitted with the first derivative of a Boltzmann function describing the nonlinear charge's movement(Santos-Sacchi, 1991[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Specifically, we plot Cv as a function of voltage and fitted with the first derivative of Boltzmann function: Cv= (Qmaxze/kT)exp(-ze(V-Vh)/kT)/(1+exp(-ze(V-Vh)/kT))2, where V is the membrane potential, Vh is the voltage at half-maximal nonlinear charge transfer, e is the electron charge, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute temperature, z is the valence, and Qmax is maximum nonlinear charge transfer. The original recording traces of the total capacity currents are shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B. The normalized NLC is shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C. The total NLC has two components, one is generated from the voltage-gated ion channel gating charge movement, and another one results from prestin activities."
