    "On-cell biotinylation    Grow 25 ml of H. pylori liquid culture in Brucella broth containing 10% fetal bovine serum until late-log phase (OD600 = 0.7) at 37 °C.    Pellet all bacteria from the 25 ml culture at 3,500 x g for 20 min at 4 °C, and discard media.   Resuspend bacterial pellet in 10 ml Biotinylation buffer.   Pellet bacteria at 3,500 x g for 10 min at 4 °C, and discard buffer.   Resuspend bacterial pellet in 10 ml Biotinylation buffer.   Add S-NHS-LC-biotin to a final concentration of 200 μM.   Incubate on ice for 30 min.   Quench reaction by adding 20 ml TNKCM, incubate at room temperature for 10 min.   Pellet bacteria at 3,500 x g for 20 min at 4 °C, and discard buffer.   Resuspend bacterial pellet in 10 ml TNKCM, pellet bacteria at 3,500 x g for 10 min at 4 °C, and discard buffer. Repeat two more times for a total of three washes.      Bacterial lysis and subcellular fractionation   Resuspend bacterial pellet in 3 ml lysis buffer + protease inhibitor cocktail.   Sonicate (4 times, 10 sec each, at 25% maximum amplitude) on ice to lyse bacteria, pellet intact bacteria at 7,000 x g for 10 min, collect lysis supernatant.   Pellet membranes by spinning lysate at 40,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C.   Discard supernatant.   Rinse membrane pellet with TKE three times.   Collect membrane pellet by scraping with a clean pipette tip and resuspend in 1 ml TKEZ + protease inhibitor cocktail.   Solubilize for 1 h at 4 °C with head-over-head mixing.   Spin at 100,000 x g for 1 h at 4 °C, collect supernatant.      Isolation and enrichment of biotinylated proteins   Dilute the supernatant 10x with sample dilution buffer (resulting in a volume of 10 ml).   Aliquot 50 μl of avidin magnetic bead suspension into a microfuge tube.",
    "Place tube on magnet, remove storage buffer.   Resuspend beads in 500 μl PBS, place on magnet and discard buffer.   Resuspend beads in 200 μl blocking buffer.   Incubate beads for 10 min with head-over-head mixing.   Place on magnet, discard buffer, resuspend beads in 400 μl regeneration buffer.   Place on magnet, discard buffer, resuspend beads in 500 μl wash buffer.   Place on magnet, discard buffer.   Add 1 ml aliquot of sample described in step C19 to equilibrated beads and incubate at room temperature with head over head mixing for 10 min. Then place the tube on magnet, discard supernatant, and apply another 1 ml aliquot. Repeat this procedure until the entire 10 ml of sample is applied to the beads.    After entire 10 ml sample from step C19 has been incubated with the magnetic beads, resuspend beads in 1 ml wash buffer, and incubate for 5 min with head-over-head mixing. Then place the tube on magnet and discard supernatant. Repeat two more times for a total of three washes.   Resuspend beads in 1 ml wash buffer and transfer the suspended beads to a clean tube.   To elute biotinylated proteins: place the bead suspension on magnet, discard supernatant, resuspend beads in 1 ml elution buffer, and incubate at room temperature for 10 min with head-over-head mixing.   Place the tube on magnet and save the supernatant. Add another 1 ml elution buffer to the beads and incubate at room temperature for 10 min with head over head mixing. Then place on the magnet and again save the supernatant. Repeat this procedure once more, resulting in a total elution volume of 3 ml.    Precipitate proteins by adding 1 ml TCA to the 3 ml elution (25% final concentration TCA).   Vortex to mix, incubate at 4 °C for at least 30 min.",
    "(Overnight storage at 4 °C is possible at this stage).   Spin at 21,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C, discard supernatant.   Add 1 ml ice cold acetone, spin at 21,000 x g at 4 °C for 10 min, discard supernatant, repeat once for a total of two acetone washes.   Air dry pellet at room temperature, store at -20 °C until needed."
