    "Bone marrow isolation (Figure 2)Euthanize mouse using institutionally approved protocols.Use sterile forceps and scissors to isolate femur and tibia.Remove residual muscle or tissue attached to the bones.Store isolated bones in a 6-well plated in PBS on ice until further processing.Push a G 18 needle through the bottom of a 0.5 ml microcentrifuge tube to generate a small hole.Place the 0.5 ml microcentrifuge tube in a larger 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.Carefully place the isolated femur and tibia (maximum 1 femur and 2 tibia) in the 0.5 ml microcentrifuge tube nested in the 1.5 ml tube and close the lid.Centrifuge the tubes at 10,000 × g for 30 s.After centrifugation confirm complete transfer of marrow into the bottom tube. If transfer was not successful, cut off epiphysis and repeat centrifugation step.Discard the 0.5 ml microcentrifuge tube containing the bones. They should be empty of marrow.Resuspend the obtained bone marrow in 1 ml ACK lysis buffer and incubate at room temperature for 2 min.Place a 0.70 µm sterile filter on a 50 ml Falcon tube.Filter the bone marrow suspension into tube and wash the filter with 10 ml PBS.Add an additional volume of 30 ml PBS through the filter; discard the filter.Close the lid on the tube and centrifuge at 350 × g for 4 min.Remove PBS by gently decanting; retain bone marrow pellet.If desired, repeat PBS wash by gently resuspending the pellet.Count isolated bone marrow cells using a Vi-CELL or other standard method.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210218/20210218212927_2776.jpgFigure 2. Experimental outline depicting bone marrow isolation steps Isolation and culture of monocytesFollowing bone marrow isolation, monocytes are enriched by negative selection using the monocyte isolation kit (Miltenyi) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Please note that other mouse monocyte isolation kits can be used for this step (e.g.",
    ", EasySepTM, Stemcell Technologies); however, these have not been evaluated for this specific protocol.Isolated monocytes can be cultured in macrophage media supplemented with 5 ng/ml rmGM-CSF and 2.5 ng/ml rmIL-4 for up to 5 days. Monocytes should be plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells in 2 ml final volume in a non-tissue culture treated 6-well plate.If desired, monocytes can be enriched from the day 5 culture by sorting for Ly6C positive, F4/80 negative, MHCII negative and CD11c negative cells at day 5 (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210218/20210218212938_5456.jpgFigure 3. Flow cytometry analysis of freshly isolated and cultured monocytes. Example of surface marker expression of Ly6C, F4/80, CD11b and I-A/I-E of freshly isolated and cultured monocytes. Monocytes are identified as Ly6C high, F4/80 low, MHCII low and CD11c low.Differentiation into bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs)Supplement macrophage media with 50 ng/ml rmM-CSF and pre-warm in a water bath to 37 °C.Suspend 12 million isolated total bone marrow cells (from Procedure A) or enriched monocytes (Procedure B) in 20 ml supplemented macrophage media and plate cells in 15 cm non-tissue culture treated plates.Place dish in cell culture incubator at 37 °C and 5 % CO2 and culture for a total of 5 days.At day 3 add 20 ml freshly supplemented macrophage media without removal of the original media.At day 5 confirm adherence of differentiated BMDMs under a microscope. Assess differentiation by flow cytometry (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210218/20210218212954_5382.jpgFigure 4. Flow cytometry analysis of monocytes differentiated into bone marrow derived macrophages (day 5). Differentiated, resting macrophages can be identified as Ly6C low, F4/80 high, CD11c low and I-A/I-E low.For downstream assays, remove media and gently wash day 5 cells in 20 ml sterile PBS. Carefully scrape cells off the dish using a cell scraper in 5 ml macrophage media.",
    "If desired, wash the dish with an additional 5 ml of macrophage media to collect additional cells.Count collected cells and re-suspend in macrophage media supplemented with 50 ng/ml rmM-CSF at desired cell density (typical density is 0.5 x 106 cells/ml). Plate cells onto tissue-culture treated dishes of desired formats.If desired, resting macrophages can be enriched from the day 5 culture by sorting for Ly6C low, F4/80 high, CD11c low and I-A/I-E low."
