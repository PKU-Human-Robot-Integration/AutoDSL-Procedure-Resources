    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDay 1: Cell seeding and transfection\nTiming: 2 h\nNote: The HEK cells are seeded at the beginning of the day and transfected with plasmid DNA around 7–8 h later.\nNote: Various co-IP and IP protocols have previously been outlined in detail (Bonifacino et al., 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; DeCaprio and Kohl, 2017b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; DeCaprio and Kohl, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Lin and Lai, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]; Takahashi, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]; Markham et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]). Here, we present an adapted step-by-step guide for co-IP experiments from lysates of cultured cells.\nNote: For this protocol, the HEK cells are grown in cell culture plastic dishes with 10 cm diameter. At confluency a dish can yield around 9 million cells. For the transfection, the cells are seeded at 5 million cells per dish. Before the experiment, expand sufficient amounts of cells.\nDay 1, morning. Aspirate the cell culture medium and add 5 mL of sterile PBS to wash the cells.\nAspirate the PBS and add 1 mL trypsin/EDTA solution. Incubate at 37°C in the cell culture incubator for around 2 min or until the cells detach.\nAdd 8 mL of PBS and resuspend the cells. Collect the cell suspension in a 50 mL conical tube.\nSpin down the cells at 180 × g for 2 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend cells in 5–10 mL PBS.\nMix 20 μL cell suspension with 20 μL trypan blue solution in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and pipette into a cell counting slide.\nCount live cells manually with a hemocytometer or with an automated cell counter to determine the cell density. Trypan blue stained dead cells are excluded. Per 10 cm dish 5∗106 cells are needed. Calculate the required volume of cell suspension.",
    "Prepare cell master mix. Per dish fill 10 mL of DMEM/10% FBS/AA medium in a 50 mL conical tube.\nAdd the corresponding volume of cell suspension to the conical tube. Mix thoroughly by inverting the tube.\nAdd 10 mL of cell master mix per 10 cm dish.\nPlace the dishes in the incubator for 7–8 h.\nBreakpoint: the cells can be grown longer (e.g., 9–14 h) but they should be transfected within 12 h after seeding. If the cells are not in the exponential growth phase and grown to high densities the transfection efficiency may be reduced (Tom et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28]).\nDay 1, afternoon. Thaw a fresh aliquot of PEI transfection solution.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_770_18.csv\nTo prepare the transfection mix, use DMEM medium without serum or antibiotics.\nNote: Here PEI transfection is used for transient protein expression in HEK cells (Longo et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]). However, alternative transfection approaches including calcium phosphate transfection or viral gene delivery may be considered.\nNote: If more than two plasmids are used, adjust the amount of DNA to not exceed 10 μg in total.\nAdd DMEM to two microcentrifuge tubes. Add plasmid DNA to tube 1, and add PEI to tube 2. Pipette the PEI suspension from tube 2 dropwise to tube 1 and mix by tipping the tube. Let stand for 15 min at 20°C–24°C.\nNote: Do not extend beyond the 15 min incubation time. The transfection efficiency decreases with prolonged incubation.\nAdd the transfection mix dropwise to the HEK cells across the 10 cm dish. Slightly rotate the dishes to mix the medium and transfection mix. Put the dishes back into the incubator.\nDay 2: Cell collection, lysis, and incubation with antibodies and protein-G agarose beads\nTiming: 4 h",
    "Note: Prepare fresh lysis buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described above. Cool down the lysis buffer and PBS on ice. Cool down cell lifters and 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes in the cold room. Cool down the refrigerated table top centrifuge to 4°C. Prepare a 1 mL pipette and pipette tips in the cold room. Cool down an aluminum cooling block for 2 mL tubes in an ice bucket in the cold room.\nDay 2. At 12–15 h after transfection, check the GFP expression in a fluorescence microscope that fits plastic cell culture dishes and is equipped with filters for GFP.\nNote: HEK cells are receptive to PEI transfection and after 12–15 h most cells should show GFP expression. If the expression is low, wait up to 18 h post transfection. Upon prolonged culture the number of cells increases. To maintain efficient cell lysis and protein and lipid solubilization, the volume of lysis buffer should be adjusted accordingly. See troubleshooting comment below (problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).\nTransfer the cell culture dishes to the cold room. Aspirate the medium. Wash cells once with 5 mL ice cold PBS. Aspirate the PBS and remove the remaining liquid with a pipette.\nNote: HEK cells are weakly adherent and may detach when washed. Be observant to add the PBS slowly to the edge of the dish.\nNote: Cell collection, sonication, solubilization, immunoblotting and the long-term incubations are performed in a cold room at 4°C.\nDetach the cells with a cold cell lifter and collect cells in one spot of the dish. With a 1 mL pipette add 500 μL of PBS and collect the cell suspension in a 2 mL tube. Place the plastic tube in an aluminum cooling block on ice.",
    "Spin down the cells in a refrigerated table top centrifuge at 4°C at 400 × g for one minute. Aspirate the supernatant. Resuspend the cells in 1 mL of ice-cold lysis buffer.\nNote: Adjust the centrifugation speed, some cells may require more gentle spins. Also, the composition of the lysis buffer can be adjusted depending on the nature of the protein and the cell line (DeCaprio and Kohl, 2017a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nNote: In this protocol the bait and prey proteins are strongly overexpressed in HEK cells. If low abundant endogenous protein complexes are analyzed by co-IP, the volume of lysis buffer may be reduced. With smaller volumes of lysis buffer, however, make sure that the cells are still properly lysed and that the membrane lipids are solubilized.\nDisrupt the cells with a probe-type sonicator for 10 s at 20% amplitude in the cold room. To solubilize proteins and lipids, rotate the tubes in the cold room for 30 min.\nNote: Sonication rapidly disrupts the cells, shears nucleic acids and generates homogenous cell lysates. Adjust the sonication conditions to reduce the generation of foam and splashes.\nTo remove cell debris, spin down the cell lysate in a table top centrifuge at maximum speed for 10 min. Collect the supernatants in fresh ice cold 1 mL microcentrifuge tubes. Discard the pellets.\nFor each sample, collect 50 μL cell lysate in an ice-cold 1.5 mL tube and store at 4°C in the fridge. These samples will be used to address the protein expression before co-IP.",
    "Note: Here it is assumed that for all samples equal amounts of cells are lysed in equal volumes of buffer. However, the overexpression of certain proteins may reduce or enhance the growth rate of the cells. To further adjust for potential variabilities, the protein concentration should be determined (e.g., by a BCA assay) and samples should be adjusted for equal amount and concentration of lysate. Moreover, the protein concentration of the lysate should be assessed by probing the expression of a housekeeping protein by immunoblotting. Frequently used housekeeping proteins are actin, tubulin, and GAPDH (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nTo the remaining 950 μL cell lysate add 2 μL GFP antibody (mouse monoclonal, Roche, 11814460001, corresponds to 0.8 μg of antibody).\nNote: In this protocol a mouse monoclonal GFP antibody is used for the immunoprecipitation and detection of the bait protein and an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag antibody is used for the detection of the prey protein. There are other tags and corresponding high affinity antibodies available, including FLAG and V5. Depending on the species and the immunoglobulin isotype protein-A or protein-G coupled agarose is used. Resources for the selection can be found in previously published co-IP protocols (Bonifacino et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nNote: Antibody affinities vary and the antibodies are stored at different protein concentrations. Consult the information provided in the datasheet on how to best use the antibody of interest for co-IP experiments.",
    "Note: Some proteins display an affinity to agarose beads. To reduce non-specific binding, the cell lysates can be pre-cleared with protein-G agarose beads in the absence of antibody. To this end, protein-G agarose (for volumes and preparation see below) is incubated with the cell lysate rotating for 30 min at 4°C. The beads are spun down at 10 × g and the supernatant is collected and processed as described above.\nFor each co-IP sample 30 μL of protein-G agarose slurry is needed. Thoroughly mix and resuspend the protein-G agarose stock solution to get a homogenous slurry.\nTo facilitate the pipetting of the beads, cut 2 mm from a 1 mL pipette tip and transfer the corresponding total volume of slurry to a 2 mL tube. Fill the tube with ice cold lysis buffer and mix.\nSpin down the slurry at 10 × g in a refrigerated table top centrifuge at 4°C. Repeat the wash step two more times to remove the storage solution from the beads.\nResuspend the beads in 100 μL lysis buffer per sample.\nNote: Slowly pipette the bead solutions to avoid damaging the agarose beads.\nNote: Alternatively, magnetic beads coated with antibody can be used. See problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7] in the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section for more detail.\nNote: To assure equal amounts of protein-G agarose beads in all samples, the beads can be distributed to the corresponding number of microcentrifuge tubes and the protein concentration per tube can be determined using a BCA assay. Once the volume of beads is equilibrated across all the tubes, the beads are spun down, the supernatant is removed and the cell lysates are added to the beads.\nAdd 100 μL bead suspension per cell lysate sample.",
    "Note: In this protocol the interaction of two exogenously overexpressed proteins is probed. As a negative control, GFP without a fused bait protein is used. In an experiment where endogenous protein complexes are being pulled down, antibody isotype controls can be used to rule out non-specific binding. Optimized isotype control antibodies are available for many species. Alternatively, knockout cells lacking expression of the protein of interest can be used as a negative control.\nNote: Here, unconjugated antibodies specific for GFP are used for the co-IP. Alternative experimental setups use antibodies covalently coupled to agarose beads or to magnetic beads or biotin conjugated antibodies that are pulled down with streptavidin conjugated beads.\nRotate the samples in the cold room at 4°C for at least 9–12 h.\nDay 3: Gel electrophoresis, protein transfer, and incubation with primary antibodies\nTiming: 6 h\nNote: Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) has been described in detail and step-by-step protocols and video instructions are available (Chrambach and Rodbard, 1971[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Smith, 1994[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]; Brunelle and Green, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nBefore you start: cool down the table top centrifuge. Thaw an aliquot of 6× sample buffer and warm to 37°C to dissolve precipitated detergent. Add 10% β-mercaptoethanol (BME) to the 6× sample buffer to establish reducing buffer conditions.\nDay 3. Spin the co-IP samples at 10 × g in the table top centrifuge for 1 min at 4°C to pellet the agarose beads.\nCollect the supernatant in a separate 1.5 mL tube for potential follow up analyses. To avoid perturbations of the bead pellet, leave behind around 100–200 μL liquid in the tube (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/770-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Critical agarose bead washing procedures",
    "(A) For the washing steps 100–200 μL lysis buffer are left behind in the microcentrifuge tube at each washing step to keep the pellet intact. The 200 μL pipette tips (yellow) are placed well apart from the beads at the wall of the tube.\n(B) After the last washing step, the entire liquid is removed from the beads via a 20 μL tip (red) placed at the bottom of the tube. Multiple rounds of aspiration may be needed to remove the liquid.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/770-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Representative immunoblot data for the experiment laid out in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]\n(A) Uncropped original immunoblots are shown. They were obtained from an experiment as it is outlined in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]. Immunoprecipitation (IP) and input (Input) samples are shown. The cropped regions are indicated by boxes. For these immunoblots, three repeats of the same experiment were loaded, the replicate in the middle was chosen for the figure panel in (B).\n(B) Cropped immunoblots from (A) are assembled into the figure panel. Most blots are shown in full size in (A). Data is reproduced with permission from Burckhardt et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4].\nAdd 1 mL ice-cold lysis buffer to wash the agarose beads. Flip the tube upside-down to wash the beads. Spin the tubes at 10 × g for one minute at 4°C. Aspirate and discard the supernatant. Repeat the wash step for two more times.\nAfter a total of three wash steps use a 20 μL pipette to remove the remaining liquid from the beads. Place the tip at the bottom of the tube and aspirate the liquid until the beads are dry (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: alternatively, a syringe with a narrow needle can be used to aspirate the remaining liquid.",
    "Add 40 μL of 6× sample buffer/10% BME to the beads. Add 10 μL 6× sample buffer/10% BME to the 50 μL lysate samples, which were collected on day 2.\nHeat all co-IP and lysate samples at 95°C for 5 min.\nMix samples by tapping the tubes and spin down for 30 s at 10 × g at 20°C–24°C in a table top centrifuge.\nNote: Here the agarose beads remain in the co-IP sample. Alternatively, to exclude the beads, elute the proteins with 0.1 M glycine pH 2–3 for 1 min. Spin down the samples for 1 min at 10 × g and collect the supernatant and neutralize with 1 M Tris pH 8.5. Repeat elution 2–3 times, pool the supernatant and add sample buffer. Elution with glycine is advantageous for co-IP reactions where the antibody is covalently coupled to the beads (Kaboord and Perr, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]). In this situation the antibody is not eluted into the sample. However, elution with glycine increases the sample volume and thus dilutes the co-IP sample. Alternatively, to reduce antibody elution, the antibodies can be crosslinked to the beads prior to the co-immunoprecipitation (Iqbal et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nPlan the number of gels that will be needed.\nNote: For the example experiment that is presented here (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C), two blots for the co-IP are analyzed (GFP, HA/14-3-3ε where the membrane is cut according to molecular weight) and six blots are used to analyze the input lysate (GFP, HA, 14-3-3ε, Akt, pS473, pT308), resulting in a total of eight blots.\nAssemble the glass plates on the gel casting system and add tap water to test for potential leaks. Reassemble if needed or seal the corners of the plates with grease.\nAfter the leak test, remove and drain the water from the space between the plates.",
    "Note: In our experience, fresh self-cast polyacrylamide gels give the most reproducible results. However, the use of pre-cast gels may be more time effective.\nPrepare a small volume of fresh 10% (w/v) ammonium persulfate (APS) stock solution. Per gel, weigh 10 mg APS and add 100 μL ddH2O.\nNote: Leftover 10% APS solution can be stored at 4°C for a few days. But the APS solution is not stable and loses activity.\nFor a 1 mm thick 10% polyacrylamide separation gel (mini-gel format, Bio-Rad) around 4.5 mL of separation gel solution are needed. Use the following volumes:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_770_19.csv\nMix the Acrylamide/Bis solution, Tris, ddH2O and TEMED in a 15 mL conical tube at 20°C–24°C.\nAdd the APS and quickly mix the solutions and start pouring the gels.\nWith a 1 mL pipette add the separation gel solution between the glass plates to a level 5 mm below the reach of the comb.\nOverlay the separation gel with 1 mL of isopropanol to smoothen the upper surface of the gel. The polymerization of the separation gel may take 5–10 min. Follow the polymerization state of the leftover gel in the conical tube.\nNote: For one co-IP experiment up to 6–10 gels may be needed. Prepare a gel master mix in a 50 mL conical tube and cast the gels in one run.\nNote: The Acrylamide/Bis solution and the TEMED are stored at 4°C.\nWhen the leftover gel in the conical tube is polymerized, remove the isopropanol from the top of the separation gel by inverting the gel.\nRinse the surface of the gel once with ddH2O and remove and drain the residual water.",
    "Note: Depending on the molecular weight of the proteins of interest, higher or lower-percentage gels may be needed. Consult gel separation charts for best separation results. Charts are provided by various vendors of electrophoresis equipment and reagents.\nFor the 5% stacking gel use the following volumes:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_770_20.csv\nMix the solutions in a 15 mL conical tube in the same order as for the separation gel and add the APS right in time to cast the gels.\nAdd the stacking gel solution on top of the separation gel and fill to the top of the glass plates.\nSlowly place the comb for either 10 or 15 wells. Follow the polymerization status of the leftover gel solution in the conical tube.\nOnce the leftover gel is polymerized, assemble the electrophoresis unit, place it in the buffer tank, remove the comb and add running buffer to the top of the chamber.\nWith a 20 μL pipette flush the wells with running buffer to remove unpolymerized gel solution from the wells.\nLet the electrophoresis chamber stand for a couple minutes and check for leaks. Reassemble the unit or refill with running buffer if needed.\nFill the unit with running buffer until the marks. Remove the air bubbles at the bottom end of the gel with a pipette.\nLoad the molecular weight standard according to the instructions on the datasheet. The amount of molecular weight standard needed depends on the sensitivity of the gel imaging system.\nLoad 15-20 μL of protein sample for 10-well gels and 12–15 μL of sample for 15 well gels (volumes for 1 mm thick gels).\nNote: Store leftover samples at −20°C in case some of the immunoblots need to be repeated or additional proteins need to be probed.",
    "Connect the electrophoresis unit to the power supply. Run the gel at constant 100 V for 90 min and regularly check the fill level of the electrophoresis chamber and the progress of the samples. If necessary, refill the unit with running buffer.\nRun the samples until adequate protein separation is reached.\nNote: Gels can be run at higher voltage but the higher running speed may affect the quality of the protein separation.\nPrepare 2 L (per 2 gels) of ice cold 1× transfer buffer with 10% ethanol.\nCut the PVDF membrane to cover the gel region of interest and add 5 mm extra membrane. Cut the Whatman papers to extend 1 cm beyond the gel.\nDisassemble the electrophoresis unit and remove one glass plate from the gel. Use a razor blade to cut away the stacking gel.\nAdd 1 L of transfer buffer to the transfer unit. Add 1 L of transfer buffer to a square plastic casserole dish (25 × 25 × 7 cm). Use enough buffer to submerge all components of the immunoblot sandwich.\nLabel the PVDF membrane with a pencil (e.g., with date and experiment ID). To wet and activate the PVDF membrane, add 10 mL methanol to a small plastic container and soak the PVDF membrane for 2 min in methanol.\nAssemble the immunoblot sandwich in the casserole dish with the white or clear side of the blotting cassette facing down.\nAdd one sponge and two Whatman papers. Place the PVDF membrane on top of the Whatman papers in the casserole.\nRemove the gel from the glass plate and place the gel on the membrane.\nArrange the gel, membrane and Whatman papers and press down the stack to remove bubbles.",
    "Keep the stack submerged and add two more Whatman papers and another sponge and close the cassette with the black lid, while keeping the sandwich submerged in transfer buffer.\nPlace the immunoblot sandwich in the transfer unit with the latch facing up and the black lid facing the black side of the unit.\nMove the transfer unit to the cold room and place it in a plastic tray to contain potential spillovers. Fill the unit to the top with transfer buffer.\nAdd the lid and place some extra weight on the lid to prevent connectivity issues (e.g., use a bottle with leftover buffer) and connect with the power supply.\nRun the transfer at a constant current of 400 mAmp for 1 h at 4°C. Check for the emergence of gas bubbles on the outside of the electrophoresis unit as an indicator for transfer activity.\nCritical: Methanol and ethanol are toxic and flammable and are considered hazardous waste. See comments above.\nNote: Immunoblotting has been described in detail (Gallagher et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Litovchick, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]). The transfer conditions can be adjusted according to the size and properties of the protein of interest. Here wet-blotting is described, however, semidry blotting can be used too.\nNote: Some combinations of proteins and antibodies may work best on nitrocellulose membranes. Consult the literature as per the antibody of interest.\nBreakpoint: the transfer can be run over night in the cold room with appropriately adjusted transfer conditions and timing. Colling packs may be inserted into the transfer unit to avoid overheating.\nCheck the antibody datasheet on how to best block the membrane. Most antibodies are used in combination with membranes that were blocked with 10% milk or 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution.",
    "Prepare 50 mL of 10% dry milk in TBST and pour the solution into a small plastic container.\nOnce the transfer is completed, take out the transfer cassette and blotting sandwich, recover the PVDF membrane and place it in the milk solution.\nBlock the PVDF membrane for 20 min at 20°C–24°C on a shaker.\nNote: Rinse the transfer unit, the sandwich cassette and the sponges with deionized water. Over time proteins will accumulate in the sponges and may transfer on the membrane and increase the background signal. The sponges can be soaked in methanol to remove residual protein. Afterwards, rinse the sponges with deionized water and let dry. Discard the methanol following hazardous waste protocols.\nPrepare the primary antibody incubation solutions. For small plastic containers an incubation volume of 4–5 mL is sufficient.\nNote: For the selection of the antibody incubation solution consult the datasheet. Frequently used solutions are 5% BSA in TBST, 5% dry milk in TBST or proprietary antibody incubation solutions.\nDilute the antibody according to the instructions and your prior optimization. Incubate the PVDF membranes with primary antibody for 9–12 h on a shaker in the cold room at 4°C.\nNote: the primary antibodies described in this protocol can be used at 1:1000 dilution.\nBreakpoint: depending on the antibody, the incubation time can be reduced to a couple hours.\nNote: In order to reduce the antibody incubation volume to save reagents, the membranes can be sealed in plastic wrap. A volume of 1–2 mL antibody solution may sufficiently cover the membrane.\nNote: Antibody solutions can be stored at −20°C for reuse. Label the tube to keep track of the usage. Antibodies will be depleted with each use.",
    "Note: The membrane can be cut into smaller portions to probe for multiple proteins of different sizes. Make sure each membrane fragment is clearly labeled.\nDay 4: Incubation with secondary antibody, exposure, and signal quantification\nTiming: 4 h\nDay 4. Get the membranes from the cold room and collect the primary antibody solution in a 15 mL conical tube. Label the tube and store at −20°C for reuse.\nAdd 25 mL TBST to rinse the membrane, and discard the solution. Repeat for a total of three rinse steps. Then wash the membrane in TBST on the shaker for 20 min at 20°C–24°C. Repeat the rinse and wash cycle for a total of three times.\nPrepare the secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP) coupled antibodies. Here, the HRP coupled antibodies are diluted 1:5000 in a 5% milk/TBST solution.\nCheck the instructions on the datasheet and use the recommended incubation solution and antibody dilutions. Incubate the membrane with the HRP-coupled antibodies for 1 h shacking at 20°C–24°C.\nNote: To reduce the signal from immunoglobulin light and heavy chains, secondary HRP coupled antibodies are available that detect only the properly folded primary antibody that is used for the immunodetection. These secondary antibodies do not detect denatured immunoglobulins from the co-IP step and thus reduce or eliminate the signals from immunoglobulin heavy and light chains from the blots.\nRinse and wash the membrane as described above. Do three cycles.\nPrepare fresh ECL solution.\nIncubate the membrane in 10 mL ECL solution in a plastic container for 30–60 s at 20°C–24°C.\nDrain the membrane and move to a fresh plastic container and place in the blot imaging station. Adjust the position of the membrane and start the image acquisition.\nRecord images until the chemiluminescence signal is clearly visible and stop before the signal reaches saturation.",
    "Note: For particularly weak signals, commercial high sensitivity ECL reagents can be used (e.g., SuperSignal West Femto, Thermo Fisher).\nAt the end of the imaging series, acquire an image of the molecular weight standard on the immunoblot membrane. This image will be used to estimate the molecular weight of the protein bands.\nOnce image acquisition is completed, extract the images in 16-bit TIF format for the densitometry and quantification.\nFor the immunoblot densitometry, open Image Studio Light. Open the image of interest in 16-bit TIF format.\nNote: Various free and commercial software packages for immunoblot densitometry are available (e.g., ImageJ/Fiji, the software at your imaging station, etc.).\nMake sure that no pixels in the region of interest are saturated. Otherwise chose images with shorter exposure times.\nDraw boxes around the protein bands of interest (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/770-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Densitometry of immunoblot data for semi-quantitative analysis\n(A) Example immunoblot data is shown with representative boxes used for the densitometry of the protein signal by the Image Studio Light software. For an experiment as outlined in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], representative immunoblots for the co-Immunoprecipitation (IP) of 14-3-3ε and Eps15 are shown.\n(B) Example of the quantification of 14-3-3ε co-immunoprecipitation (IP) signal after normalization with the SH3BP4-GFP IP signal (see Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/770-Mmc1.xlsx]A). Negative intensity values were set to zero. The intensity values are normalized with the middle sample.\n(C) Example quantification of the experiment outlined in Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]. The data from seven repeats that were performed on three separate days was combined. The function AVERAGE in Excel was used to calculate mean values (see Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/770-Mmc1.xlsx]B).",
    "(D) The co-IP data and statistical analysis of SH3BP4-GFP binding to HA-Eps15 and to endogenous 14-3-3ε are shown. The data is from the experiment described in Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], and 4A–4C. For statistical analysis the Wilcoxon rank sum test was used and mean and +/− standard error of the mean are shown, ∗ P < 0.05. The data is reproduced with permission from Burckhardt et al., (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4].\nCopy the resulting background subtracted intensity values into a spread sheet (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B, Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/770-Mmc1.xlsx]A).\nNote: The intensity values from the co-IP of 14-3-3ε are found in the cells D4 to D6. In this example the value of D4 was negative and was therefore set to zero. The intensity values of the protein bands from the co-IP immunoblot for SH3BP4-GFP are found in the cells D10-D12 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nNext, normalize the signal of the prey proteins with the signal from the GFP-tagged bait protein.\nNote: Here, the intensity of the co-IP of 14-3-3ε is divided by the intensity of the co-IP of SH3BP4-GFP. Thus, in the spreadsheet, cell E5 reads “=D5/D11” (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B, Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/770-Mmc1.xlsx]A).\nNext, use the intensity of the control sample of the experiment to normalize the samples with perturbations.\nNote: In this experiment, the second sample with the co-IP of SH3BP4-GFP wt in the absence of Akt1-wt-HA overexpression (cell E5) is considered the control. Consequently, the cell F5 is set to one. The intensity values for the other samples are divided by the intensity value of the control. To this end, the cell F4 reads “=E4/E5’ and cell F6 reads “=E6/E5” (Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/770-Mmc1.xlsx]A).\nCombine the normalized values from 3-5 experiments in the spread sheet (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C, Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/770-Mmc1.xlsx]B).",
    "Note: Here, the data from seven experiments that were performed on three separate days were combined (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C). The values from Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B cells F4 to F6 were transferred to the spreadsheet in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C in the cells E9 to E11. Next the arithmetic mean values are calculated. Hence for the co-IP of 14-3-3ε vs. SH3BP4-GFP wt in the presence of Akt1-wt-HA overexpression (row 11) the mean is calculated in the spreadsheet by the function “=AVERAGE(D11:J11)” in the cell K11 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C, Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/770-Mmc1.xlsx]B).\nUse a spreadsheet or statistics software package to calculate mean, error bars and statistical significance and to plot the data (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nNote: In this plot, the values from the cells D5 to J5 are plotted for the second sample of the co-IP of Eps15 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D). And the mean value for this sample is obtained from the cell K5 in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D and Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/770-Mmc1.xlsx]B.\nNote: Densitometry has been used to quantify immunoblots and the protocols and limitations have been described in detail (Taylor and Posch, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]; Gassmann et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). Critical factors include sample preparation, the validity of the antibodies, the linear range of the assay and the setup of the detection system (Pillai-Kastoori et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]). Moreover, here a fix point reference sample is used (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B and 4C). However more advanced approaches for sample normalization have been proposed and can be implemented (Degasperi et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nProcess the immunoblot images to assemble the figure panel. Open the TIF image in ImageJ/Fiji (or your image processing software of choice).\nScale the image intensity, crop the region of interest and save in a format that is compatible with the software used for the assembly of the figures (e.g., Illustrator, PowerPoint, etc.).\nAssemble the figure according to the guidelines from the journal of interest."
