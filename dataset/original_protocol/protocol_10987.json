    "1. Preparing the feeding chamber\nNote: The feeding chamber for dye-labeling feeding assay consists of two parts: the outside container (as a cover) and the inside container (as food source).\nModify the outside container from a glass vial for culturing Drosophila (with an internal diameter of 31.8 mm and a height of 80 mm) (Figure 1A, 1C). Cover the bottom of the container with a layer of 1% agarose (5 mL) to keep the feeding setup properly humidified and serve as a soft substrate for the flies to walk upon (Figure 1B). The container thereby provides a controlled but naturalistic setting carrying with minimal stress or disturbance to the flies.\n\t\nPrepare the outside container. Suspend 0.5 g of agarose in 50 mL of double distilled water, heat with frequent agitation, and boil to dissolve completely on a magnetic stirrer with a heat plate.\nWhen the 1% agarose cools to about 60 °C, transfer 5 mL of 1% agarose to an empty outside container (Figure 1B), and let the container stay open until cooled down to room temperature to yield an agarose pad.\nPrepare dye-labeled food. Composition of the dye-labeled food varies according to different experimental purposes. Here is an example of preparing the dye-labeled food containing only sucrose.\n\t\nAdd 0.5 g of agarose to 50 mL of double distilled water, heat with frequent agitation, and boil to dissolve completely on a magnetic stirrer with a heat plate.\nWhen the above 1% agarose cools to about 60 °C, add 1.71 g of sucrose to the agarose to obtain 100 mM sucrose.\nAdd 0.25 g of blue dye (erioglaucine disodium) to the agarose solution to obtain 0.5% (w/v) dye-labeled food.",
    "Prepare the inside container. Put the empty inside containers on a flat horizontal surface, then add 750 µL of blue dye-labeled food to individual food container, let it solidify for at least 5 min.\nNote: The inside container is a small plastic dish with an internal diameter of 13.6 mm and a height of 7.5 mm (Figure 1A, 1C). It is filled with dye-labeled food, and is then positioned at the center of the agarose pad of the outside container.\nTransfer a filled inside container into a prepared outside container and position it at the center of the agarose pad. Let the feeding chambers stay open at room temperature for 40 min until the wall of the outside container is free of condensation.\nNote: The dry wall is necessary to prevent the flies from being stuck onto the wall by contacting water drops.\nPrepare feeding chambers with dye-free food (same composition but without dye) for background subtraction.\n2. Preparation of flies\nNote: Adult female flies 5 to 10 day after eclosion are normally used for feeding assays. It is recommended to Prepare flies of different genotypes, including genetic controls, and to test in parallel. 20 flies (from one feeding chamber) generate one data point.\nConsider the population density for rearing adult flies. Typically, control the population density by varying the number of parental flies according to the strains and the dimensions of culture bottles. As an example, transfer 15 males and 30 females of Canton-S to a culture bottle (with a diameter of 31.8 mm and a height of 80 mm) and let the females to lay eggs for one day then remove the adult flies.\nPrepare flies for thermogenetic activation.",
    "Use the Gal4/UAS system38 to express dTRPA133 in various neurons by crossing UAS-dTrpA1 flies with different GAL4 driver lines (Figure 2B).\nKeep the adult flies on standard food at 22 °C, 60% relative humidity, and a 12 h/12 h light-dark cycle.\nTwo days prior to the feeding assay, sort and collect flies on a CO2 fly pad under a stereo microscope into a fresh food vial and keep a density of 20 flies per vial.\nPrepare flies for optogenetic activation.\n\t\nUse the Gal4/UAS system38 to express CsChrimson36 in different neurons by crossing UAS-CsChrimson flies with different GAL4 driver lines.\nCollect newly eclosed (within 24 h) flies and transfer them into a vial with standard food containing 400 µM all-trans-retinal.\nTo prevent premature activation, wrap the rearing vials with aluminum foil and then put them into a dark box to protect flies from unwanted light stimulation. Keep the flies at 25 °C, 60% humidity in the dark for 4 - 6 days.\nTwo days prior to the feeding assay, sort female flies on CO2 fly pad under a stereo microscope. Collect 20 flies into one food vial and keep them in the dark prior to the feeding test.\nConduct all operations under dim light as quickly as possible to avoid the effects caused by ambient light. Use a LED lamp placed far away from the working area, the intensity at the working area is 5 µW/cm2.\nNote: Use starved Canton-S flies as a positive control for the feeding assay. Deprive these flies of food and maintain on 1% agarose for 24 h prior to the feeding test. The levels of food consumption of these flies help evaluate the day-to-day fluctuations.\n3. Thermogenetic activation",
    "Conduct all feeding experiments at the same time of the day, around Zeitgeber time 4 - 631,32, to minimize variations due to circadian rhythms.\nPrepare an incubator (or a small room with a temperature-controlled heater) as the heating environment.\nBefore behavioral experiments, equilibrate the prepared feeding chambers at the experimental temperature (30 °C) for 2 h to ensure the temperature is relative uniform in the feeding chamber.\nTo start the feeding process, carefully transfer 20 flies from their home vial into a preheated feeding chamber by gentle tapping. Continue the feeding process at 30 °C for 60 min ( Figure 3A) .\nNote: Frequent agitations, such as opening and closing the incubator door, adversely affect the feeding behavior, thus should be minimized.\nCease feeding at 60 min by freezing the feeding chambers at -80 °C (or -20 °C) for 30 min.\nNote: Freezing helps to stop feedings in all chambers simultaneously. Freezing flies at -80 °C serves two purposes, for euthanizing the flies and for storage until homogenization for up to one week.\nFor the temperature control group, transfer 20 flies into a room temperature feeding chamber with dye-colored food to start the feeding process at 22 °C for 60 min.\nCease feeding of the temperature control group by freezing the chambers at -80 °C (or -20 °C) for 30 min.\n4. Optogenetic activation\nConduct all feeding experiments at the same time of the day, around Zeitgeber time 4 - 631,32, to minimize variations due to circadian rhythms.\nCarefully transfer 20 flies from one vial into a feeding chamber by gentle tapping, and then put the chamber sideways on the illumination setup (Figure 4A, 4B).",
    "For optogenetic manipulation, use an array of orange LEDs (607 nm) as the source of light stimulation, and fix a horizontal plexiglass plate above the LEDs to support the feeding chambers during illumination. Keep the setup in an incubator at 25 °C with 60% humidity (Figure 4A, 4B).\nStimulate the genetic control flies in parallel with the Taotie>CsChrimson flies, but in different feeding chambers.\nContinue the feeding process for 60 min with back illumination by the orange light.\n\t\nDetermine the optimal illumination intensities for optogenetics experimentally36. For the Taotie>CsChrimson flies, an intensity of 2.2 mW/mm2 induces paralysis (cessation of locomotion and loss of postural control), therefore, use an intermediate intensity of 0.1 mW/mm2 to stimulate the Taotie>CsChrimson flies during the feeding test.\nCease the feeding by freezing feeding chambers at -80 °C (or -20 °C) for 30 min.\n5. Visual estimation of food consumption\nNote: The visual scoring approach provides a semi-quantitative estimation of food consumptions. Although it is not as objective as the optical method, this method allows for going through a large number of fly strains in a timely fashion, making it suitable for the first round of a genetic screen to quickly narrow down the list of candidates for further tests.\nAfter the feeding process, anesthetize and score the flies on a CO2 fly pad under a stereo microscope. Give individual score to each fly based on the volume and intensity of dye-colored food in its abdomen (Figure 2A).\n\tNOTE: Criteria for visual estimation: the score system has 4 levels of food intake corresponding to different volumes and intensities of colored food in the abdomen.",
    "Score flies without detectable dye-colored food a score of 0; give those with faint (barely detectable) blue dye or with dye-colored food occupying less than one third of the volume of the abdomen a score of 1.\nScore flies with intense dye-colored food occupying one-half of the abdomen a score of 2.\nScore those with intense dyed content occupying greater than half of the abdomen a score of 3 (Figure 2A).\nCalculate the proportion of flies with different scores in each experimental condition (Figure 2B).\n6. Colorimetric quantification of food consumption\nAfter cessation of feeding, pour out all 20 flies from a feeding chamber onto a piece of weighing paper, then transfer them into a 1.5 mL tube using a soft brush.\nNote: Do not take all of the chambers out of -80 °C storage at the same time to avoid flies sticking to the chamber wall because of water condensation on the cold chamber.\nAdd 500 µL of PBST to the tube and homogenize the flies using a grinding mill at 60 Hz for 5 s.\n\t\nConfirm sufficient homogenization by observation when there are no detectable fragments of body parts.\nSpin the tubes with homogenates for 30 min at 13,000 rpm to clear the debris.\nAfter centrifugation, transfer 100 µL of supernatant to a well of a 96-well plate.\nAfter all samples are loaded, put the plate into a plate reader to measure the absorbance of the samples at 630 nm.\nTo remove the background absorbance, subtract the absorbance of the supernatants from flies fed on food without dye from the absorbance of the supernatant from the blue food-fed flies.",
    "Note: This step is optional, depending on the compositions of the food used. When a fly food (without the dye) generates absorbance at 630 nm, it is necessary to perform this step to eliminate the background.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
