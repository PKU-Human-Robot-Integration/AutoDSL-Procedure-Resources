    "All procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) Research Ethics Committee (REC) and the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 (in its most recently amended version). Informed consent must be obtained from all patients if further clinical trial is prepared.\nNOTE: The anesthesia procedure can be categorized into three steps: pre-operative evaluation of the patient, intraoperative management, and postoperative management. During pre-operative evaluation, all patient data, including the thorough history and physical examination, should be collected and the staff should recognize patient comorbidities and how they relate to the anesthetic care of the patient. A thorough airway exam should be performed, and the staff should be aware of the anesthetic options to formulate a basic anesthetic care plan. During intraoperative management, the anesthesiologist should check the basic functions of the anesthesia machine, and apply basic physiologic monitors recommended by the American Society of Anesthesiologists, which include a pulse oximeter, electrocardiography, a noninvasive blood pressure device, and a temperature monitor, airway management options, pharmacology of inductions agents, and indications during an anesthetic induction. Intraoperative events, such as hypotension, hypertension, hypoxia, and oliguria, must be recognized, evaluated, and managed. Additionally, the staff must recognize when the patient meets the extubation criteria.\n1. Pre-operative setting and planning\nNOTE: During surgery, sterile surgical drapes should be used to prevent contact with unprepared surfaces and to maintain surgical site sterility of the environmental surfaces, equipment, and patient’s surroundings. To reduce the risk of pathogen transmission to both the patients and the surgical team, sterile surgical gowns should be worn over the scrub suits by the operating team during surgery.\nRemove all components that can affect fluoroscopy from the surgical site; this depends on the surgical plan according to each individual patient.",
    "Place the patient in a prone position after administering anesthesia and prepare as per surgical requirements.\n\tNOTE: All anesthesia procedures must be performed under the supervision of an anesthesiologist and each plan should be adjusted according to each individual patient.\nClean and sterilize the surgical site of the patient.\nCover the OP-site at the surgical site of the patient.\nPlace the sterile surgical drape on the patient, except at the surgical site.\nAnchor the FF to the patient; users can choose one of the following two methods according to their needs.\n\t\nAnchoring to the iliac bone (applicable surgical site: L5 or S1).\n\t\t\nPlace two percutaneous wires (Φ = 1.5 mm) on the posterior iliac crest and check the entry point under fluoroscopy. Repeat the step if surgeon has a concern about the entry point. Mark the entry point by using a marker pen.\nInsert the first percutaneous pin (Φ = 5 mm, L = 140 mm) into the patient’s posterior iliac crest by using a power drill (1000 RPM).\nPlace the FF along with the first percutaneous pin. Adjust the FF until it is recognized by the optical tracking camera. Fix the FF to the first percutaneous pin using a screwdriver.\nInsert the second percutaneous pin (Φ = 5 mm, L = 140 mm) along with a hole on the FF using a power drill (1000 RPM). Fix the screw on the FF to the second percutaneous pin using screwdriver.\n\t\t\tNOTE: According to the manual of the optical tracking system, the marker sphere can be identified within 3 m from the optical tracker.\nAnchoring to the current or adjacent vertebral spinous process with a clamp applicable surgical site: thoracic, lumbar, or sacral vertebrae.",
    "Place a wire (Φ = 1.5 mm) on the patient’s back as a reference under fluoroscopy. Check the surgical field under fluoroscopy. Repeat the step if surgeon has a concern about the surgical field. Mark the surgical field by using a marker pen.\nIncise the skin tissue on surgical field using a surgical scalpel. Fix the FF to the spinous process using a screwdriver. Due to the difference of bone mineral density, have the surgeon determine if the FF is anchored on spinous process firmly.\nCheck whether the equipment and components of PSNS have been prepared, including the handpiece, the optical tracking system, the robotic workstation, and the navigation toolkit (i.e., probe) (Figure 3 & Figure 4).\n\tNOTE: Avoid interfering with the surgical staff; Avoid blocking the optical tracking camera; Ensure the tracker is stable and recognized by the optical tracking system; Sterilize the navigational toolkit and place it on the operating table.\n2. Spatial labeling and registration\nTransfer the patient’s preoperative CT images to the system through DVD or USB and crop the image size to adjust the orientation based on surgical needs. The system provides virtual surgical guided images, including sagittal, coronal, axial, and oblique planes, and customized 3D reconstructions for each vertebra.\nAs the PSNS software provides the labeling interface, ask the surgeon to label each vertebra with the anterior-posterior view and lateral view, differentiating the intervertebral disc for the subsequent steps to be identified.\nSelect the optimal screw length and implant dimensions based on the device software.\nPlan the optimal positioning and trajectory of the screw based on the 3D and multi-planar image reconstruction of the preoperative CT scan.\nConfirm whether all the planned screws are correct and appropriate.",
    "Enter the DRF monitoring interface in the PSNS software that presents multiple planar views (include 3D volume and three cross-sectional planes on the side). All the DRFs should be inside the vision area of the optical tracking system (according to the user instructions, the recommended best recognition range is range B.) When the DRF vector arrow indicating the tracker is displayed on the user interface, it is stably recognized by the tracking system (Figure 5).\nPerform a subperiosteal dissection bilaterally along the spinous process, the laminae out to the tips of the transverse processes of all the levels. Remove the facet joint capsules to expose the joints. The use of self-retained retractors aid in vertebra exposure by holding the musculature off to the side.\nPerform registration procedures, including landmark registration and surface matching. Follow the sequence below to ensure the correctness of the registration result.\n\t\nLandmark registration\n\t\t\nSelect at least four non-coplanar feature points (such as the spinous process, the laminar, and the transverse process) on the patient’s pre-operative 3D reconstruction CT images.\nUse the tip of probe to keep in contact with the first feature point selected in step 2.8.1.1 in the actual surgical area.\nPress the probe selection button on the software interface to confirm the access point.\nRepeat steps 2.8.1.2-2.8.1.3 until the four feature points selected in step 2.8.1.1 are confirmed.\nPress the calculation button on the software interface; the system will calculate the result of the landmark registration and present it in the software interface.\nThe acceptance criteria for the registration accuracy must meet the needs of the clinical indications (<5 mm). If the result is not satisfactory, repeat steps 2.8.1.1-2.8.1.5 until the registration result meets the acceptance criteria.",
    "NOTE: Ensure that the validity of using the probe to obtain the position information of the bone surface, such as clearing the soft tissue on the bone surface and avoiding the dangling of the probe tip when collecting points.\nSurface matching\n\t\t\nUse the probe tip to continuously contact any point on the bone surface in the actual surgical area.\nPress the probe selection button on the software interface to confirm the access point\nMove the probe (make probe different from previous pick point), and repeat steps 2.8.2.1-2.8.2.2 until at least 50 pick points are completed.\nPress the calculation button on the software interface; the system will calculate the surface matching result and present it on the software interface.\nThe acceptance criteria for the registration accuracy must meet the needs of the clinical indications (<0.5 mm). If the result is not satisfactory, repeat steps 2.8.2.1-2.8.2.4 until the registration results meet the acceptance criteria.\nUse the probe to select obvious anatomical landmarks (such as spinous process, transverse processes, facet joint) of the actual surgical area for confirmation once the registration result is accepted (Figure 6).\n\tNOTE: Appropriate reflection and reception of the infrared light must be maintained during surgery. If the optical tracking system cannot recognize the markers, the software interface will display a red light reminder. The camera should be adjusted such that the surgical field is at the center of the camera’s detection range, and the tracker should be protected from light and blood.\n3. Robot assembly and motion\nCover the handpiece with sterilization drapes and install the surgical instruments on the robot (e.g., trocar (Φ = 5 mm) and k-pin (Φ = 1.8 mm)).",
    "Adjust the angle and position of the handpiece in space according to the following instructions (steps 3.2.1-3.2.2) so that the handpiece is within the compensation range (within a distance of one centimeter and an included angle of 4 degrees from the planned path).\n\t\nAngle adjustment: Turn the angle of the handpiece in space so that the two circles representing the angle of the handpiece coincide on the software interface.\nPosition adjustment: horizontally and vertically move the position of the handpiece in space, so that the dots representing the position of the handpiece on the software interface are aligned with the entry points of the planned path.\n\t\tNOTE: When steps 3.2.1 & 3.2.2 are completed at the same time, the handpiece will automatically activate the active compensation function to maintain the angle and position of the instrument to conform to the pre-planned path (Figure 7).\nDetermine the robot's operating status by judging the marker color of the robot displayed on the UI. If it is green, it can be operated, if it is red, it cannot be operated.\n\tNOTE: If the handpiece comes in contact with the patient or the surrounding obstacles, an emergency stop button located above the navigation workstation housing can be pressed by the surgeon or technician. Regular maintenance of the robot should be performed. The platform must be recalibrated for the kinematics parameters after 250 uses. The trocar and k-pin must be discarded after a single use.\n4. Pedicle preparation and screw insertion\nActivate the drill function of the handpiece, and drill the instruments mounted on the front end (including K-pin: Φ = 1.8 mm and trocar: Φ = 5 mm) into the patient's body along the planned path.\nUse the c-arm to confirm the position of k-pin and trocar.",
    "If the k-pin and trocar positions are not correct under fluoroscopy, remove the k-pin and trocar. Then, using the handpiece, drill into the pedicle again until the k-pin and trocar insert into prone positions under fluoroscopy (refer to 4.3.1-4.3.2).\n\t\nUnder AP view, determine whether the instrument is located in the oval area formed by the pedicle in the perspective image.\nUnder LAT view, determine whether the instrument is within the range of the pedicle and vertebra.\nReplace K-pin and trocar with guidewires (Φ = 1.5 mm, L = 400 mm) once the positions are appropriate.\nInsert the pedicle screw through the guidewires.\nRepeat steps 4.1–4.4 to complete all surgical planning paths.\n\tNOTE: As for postoperative management, patients should be monitored in the post-anesthesia recovery unit (PACU) and the post-operative analgesia options should be selected. The basic PACU events, such as nausea, pain, hypotension, hypertension, and hypoxia, should be evaluated. Additionally, the staff should recognize when the patient meets the criteria for PACU discharge.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
