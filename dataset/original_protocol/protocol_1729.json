    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis guide is designed to enable identification and quantification of individual phosphorylation events and proteins by LC-MS. All necessary phases of the experiments are explained in detailed steps (for an overview, see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]), including lysis of the cells, bottom-up proteomic sample preparation, LC-MS data acquisition and raw-data processing and analyses. The LC-MS analysis and respective down-stream processing are carried out for samples of the unenriched (total proteome) and phospho-enriched peptide samples (phosphoproteome).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1317-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Phosphoproteomics workflow for the quantitative analysis of phosphorylation events in cortical neurons\nThe major sections of the protocol are shown in the boxes of the flowchart with their corresponding steps listed below. Different coloring of the boxes indicates the two separate analyses for profiling of the phosphoproteome (plum) or the total proteome (turquoise) after splitting the purified peptides of each sample in step 31.\nCell lysis\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThe first step of the protocol aims at physical cell disruption to access all cellular contents. To break cells sufficiently, we use the classical approach of mechanical disruption, i.e., a mild method using shearing forces induced by pipetting. To solubilize the proteins – especially hydrophobic membrane proteins – but also to minimize activity of endogenous proteases and phosphatases, we add detergents to the lysis buffer. Homogenous and reproducible cell lysis is essential in proteomics protocols as accurate protein concentration determination as well as digest efficiency heavily rely on this step.\nBriefly thaw frozen cell pellets in hand.\nLyse the cells in lysis buffer (200 μL per 3 million neurons) by pipetting up and down using a mechanical pipette (i.e., P200). Repeat pipetting at least 15 times or until the solution is clear.",
    "Add 1 μL benzonase to each sample, mix well by pipetting up and down and incubate for 10 min at room temperature (20°C–22°C).\nClear the lysate by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 × g at room temperature.\nTransfer the supernatant in a fresh reaction tube.\nCritical: In step 2, make sure that the cell pellet is lysed homogeneously. If a considerable pellet remains after step 4, lysis was insufficient (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).\nPause point: Neuronal lysates can be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for up to a year.\nProtein concentration determination\nTiming: 1 h\nFor comparative, label-free proteomics studies, it is essential to determine the protein concentration in all samples accurately to normalize protein input for each digest preparation. We typically measure protein concentrations using commercially available colorimetric kits such as the Pierce BCA protein quantification kit.\nPrepare a standard curve using bovine serum albumin (BSA; range: 35–2000 μg/μL) in lysis buffer (same dilution as samples).\nPerform the BCA-procedure as described in the manufacturer’s protocol.\nMeasure the absorbance in a microplate reader at (or around) 562 nm.\nCalculate a standard curve using the values from the different concentrations of BSA and determine the protein concentration of all samples accordingly.\nCritical: Do not add reducing agents to the sample at this point, as they heavily interfere with the colorimetric assay. Similarly, detergents cause noticeable interference with analysis. Hence, we recommend diluting the sample below 5% SDS for the BCA-analysis.\nNote: To generate reliable and precise data, work in technical duplicates and/ or apply different dilutions of each sample.\nNote: A protein concentrations of 3–5 mg/mL is within the expected range for the undiluted SDS-lysate. Protein concentrations should be similar for all samples of the same preparation.\nProtein digestion\nTiming: 18–20 h",
    "In bottom-up proteomics, proteins are cut into peptides in a controlled digestion reaction. This process is enzymatically catalyzed by proteases that cleave the extracted and solubilized proteins in a residue-specific manner. Trypsin is the most widely-used protease for this type of experiment cleaving the proteins C-terminally of lysine or arginine residues. The cleavage results in peptides with a positively charged amino acid at the C-terminus that is beneficial for the ionization required for LC-MS. Here we use an adapted version of the suspension trapping protocol (Hailemariam et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Zougman et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib33]) to perform digestion working with commercially available mini spin columns, S-traps (Profiti). We found that in our hands these spin filters are scalable to different sample amounts and generate clean, detergent-free samples with little preparational loss.\nAlternatives: This part of the protocol is based on S-trap mini spin columns. This product can be substituted with other centrifugal filter units such as the Microcon centrifugal filter unit with 10 kDa molecular weight cut-off (Millipore). In combination with this type of filter it is, however, necessary to switch to a digestion protocol suitable for the different filter membrane material (as described in Wiśniewski et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib29]).\nAdjust the protein content of all samples to 350 μg protein and prepare them in the same volume. Required volume depends on protein input and/or lysis efficiency. Dilute with lysis buffer if necessary.\nAdd DTT dissolved in lysis buffer to reduce protein disulfide bonds. Use a final concentration of 20 mM.\nHeat and incubate for 5 min at 56°C shaking at 400 rpm.\nIncubate for additional 5 min at room temperature shaking at 400 rpm.\nAlkylate free sulfhydryl groups on cysteine residues with IAA dissolved in lysis buffer. Use a final concentration of 40 mM.",
    "Incubate 30 min in the dark shaking with 400 rpm.\nAdd 12% aqueous phosphoric acid at 1:10 for a final concentration of 1.2% acid to the lysate and mix it well.\nAdd six parts of binding buffer to one part of the acidified sample (7:1 ratio) and carefully mix it by pipetting up and down a few times.\nAdd the mix onto the spin column in 400 μL steps. Centrifuge at 4,000 × g for 20 s or until all solvent has passed through the filter. Discard the flow-through when necessary.\nWash the captured protein by adding 400 μL protein binding buffer and centrifuge at 4,000 × g for 20 s. Repeat this step for a total of four washes. Discard the flow-through when necessary.\nTransfer the mini spin column into a new reaction tube.\nAdd 125 μL digestion buffer containing the protease in 1:50 enzyme-to-protein ratio to each sample.\nSpin down the liquid very briefly (1–2 s) to ensure that the whole filter is soaked in digestion buffer and return any solution that passes to the top of the filter again. Ensure that there are no air bubbles on top of the filter.\nIncubate the samples overnight (approx. 16 h) in a wet chamber at room temperature. Close the caps of all reaction tubes.\nNote: At step 14, the acidified SDS-lysate forms a protein particulate suspension in the organic environment. Do not centrifuge at this point to prevent pellet formation and to ensure a complete transfer of protein to the filter.\nNote: Depending on the volume of the lysate, step 15 needs to be repeated several times until all lysate has been loaded onto the column.\nNote: Efficiency of the tryptic digest can be checked in the downstream data analysis (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).",
    "Note: To prevent evaporative loss during step 20, prepare a wet chamber to generate a humid environment during digestion. Such a chamber can be easily set up using a microtube storage box with a lid and pre-wetted tissue sheets that are placed at the sides within it.\nPeptide collection and purification prior phosphopeptide enrichment\nTiming: 1–1.5 h\nTo remove chemicals that might interfere with the subsequent enrichment of phosphorylated peptides or the following LC-MS analysis of the total proteome, peptides resulting from the digest are washed using C18 cartridges, e.g., the SepPak C18 cartridge with 100 mg sorbent (Waters).\nAdd 80 μL of digestion buffer (without protease) to the filter unit and centrifuge at 4,000 × g for 60 s to elute generated peptides.\nAdd 80 μL of 0.2% FA to the filter unit and centrifuge at 4,000 × g for 60 s. Repeat this step once.\nMix the elution fractions.\nCondition the Sep Pak C18 cartridge with 2 mL pure ACN. Either apply positive pressure using a syringe to pass the solvent through the resin or employ a vacuum manifold (step 24–30).\nWash the sorbent with 1 mL of 50% ACN/ 0.5% acetic acid.\nEquilibrate the sorbent with 2 mL of 0.1% TFA.\nLoad acidified peptide digests onto the cartridge.\nWash and desalt with 1 mL of 0.1% TFA.\nWash with 200 μL 0.5% acetic acid to remove TFA prior elution.\nElute the desalted peptides with 200 μL of 50% acetonitrile/ 0.5% acetic acid into a fresh reaction tube. Repeat this step once.\nTake a fraction of the sample (5% v/v) and transfer it into a new reaction tube for screening of the total proteome. At this point, there are two samples (95% v/v or 5% v/v) for each experimental and replicate condition.",
    "Dry all samples in a speedVac at room temperature.\nCritical: Remember to split the yield of the purified peptides to analyse the proteome (5% v/v of the digest) and the phosphoproteome (95% v/v of digest for phosphopeptide enrichment) before the samples are dried!\nNote: If you work with limited sample amounts and/or to maximize the yield, we recommend to repeat step 27 and to re-load the peptides. For this purpose, use a fresh reaction tube before loading and then re-add the solution that passed the tip.\nAlternatives: Desalted peptide samples can be dried using a speedVac (step 32) or any other equivalent vacuum dryer, i.e. using a freeze dryer (lyophilisation).\nPause point: Purified and dried peptides can be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −20°C until LC-analysis or phosphopeptide enrichment for at least 6 months.\nPhosphopeptide enrichment and purification\nTiming: 1.5–2 h",
    "Previous in-depth analyses suggest that the majority of (human) proteins may be modified by phosphorylation (around 75%; Sharma et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]). However, these post-translational modifications are generally sub-stoichiometric. In complex samples such as neuronal lysates, low-abundant phosphopeptide species are hard to detect as they are masked by unmodified, higher-abundant peptides. Thus, affinity purification or enrichment steps are typically used to reduce sample complexity and to enrich for phosphorylated peptides prior to LC-MS analysis. There are different strategies available to purify phosphopeptides (Leitner, 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]; Low et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). Phosphopeptide enrichment using TiO2-beads has proven to be an easy and robust method in our hands, which we employ using commercially available TiO2-tips (High-Select TiO2 phosphopeptide enrichment kit, Thermo Scientific). When necessary, this step can be replaced by any other phosphopeptide enrichment approach that yields phosphopeptides in similar purity and quantity. Subsequent stage-tip purification prior to MS-analyses is required as residual particulates or salts can negatively affect the C18 columns and interfere with the analysis (Rappsilber et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]).\nResuspend the dried peptides (95% v/v of previous elution) in 150 μL of Binding/Equilibration buffer.\nVortex the sample briefly and spin down in a tabletop centrifuge.\nUltrasonicate the sample in a water bath for 1 min at room temperature and spin down in a tabletop centrifuge.\nTo ensure binding, control for acidic pH of the resuspended sample using pH-paper (at or below pH 2).\nPerform the phosphopeptide-enrichment as described in the manufacturer’s protocol.\nDry the samples in a speedVac at room temperature.\nPrepare stage tips with a 200 μL pipette tip and two disks of C18 material for each sample (for details see Rappsilber et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]).\nDissolve phosphopeptides in 0.1% aqueous FA.\nVortex the sample briefly and spin down in a tabletop centrifuge.",
    "Ultrasonicate the sample in a water bath for 1 min and spin down in a tabletop centrifuge.\nCondition the disks by adding 100 μL pure methanol. Centrifuge at 2,000 × g for 3 min.\nWash with 100 μL of 50% ACN/ 0.5% acetic acid. Centrifuge at 2,000 × g for 3 min.\nEquilibrate with 100 μL of 0.5% acetic acid. Repeat this step once.\nLoad phosphopeptides onto the tip. Centrifuge at 1,500 × g for 5 min.\nWash and desalt with 100 μL of 0.5% acetic acid. Centrifuge at 2,000 × g for 3 min.\nElute the desalted phosphopeptides with 75 μL of 50% acetonitrile/ 0.5% acetic acid into a fresh 1.5 mL reaction tube. Centrifuge at 2,000 × g for 3 min. Repeat this step once.\nDry the sample in a speedVac at room temperature.\nNote: To maximize your yield (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]), we recommend repeating step 41 and re-loading the phosphopeptides. For this purpose, use a fresh reaction tube before loading and re-add the solution that has passed the tip.\nCritical: Duration of the centrifugation steps during the phosphopeptide purification (steps 38–43) can vary. Generally, centrifuge until all solvents passed the membrane, while preventing it from drying out completely.\nPause point: Purified and dried phosphopeptides can be stored at −20°C for at least 6 month. Do not freeze the peptides in the elution buffer after TiO2-affinity enrichment. The basic pH can lead to a loss of the phosphate moiety from the modified peptides.\nLC-MS/MS analysis\nTiming: 1 day–1 week; depending on samples",
    "The purified peptides are separated using reverse-phase (RP) chromatography, ionized via electro-spray ionization (ESI) and analysed in the mass spectrometer. Peptide mass is determined in full scans (MS1). The acquisition of fragment spectra (MS2) then allows unambiguous assignment of peptide identity and phospho-site location. This protocol is designed as a label-free, bottom-up approach, meaning that MS1 signal intensities of peptides are quantified and compared between experimental conditions, i.e., a treated and an untreated (control) sample.\nAlternatives: The following steps are optimized for our LC-MS setup but any equivalent nano-HPLC system coupled to a high-resolution tandem mass spectrometer applicable for high-throughput proteomics can be used instead (e.g., Thermo Q Exactive, Exploris or Tribrid or Bruker TimsTOF Pro series).\nDissolve the dried peptides of each sample in 15 μL reconstitution buffer.\nVortex the sample briefly and spin down in a tabletop centrifuge.\nUltrasonicate the sample in a water bath for 1 min and spin down in a tabletop centrifuge.\nTransfer the samples in autosampler vials, e.g., QuanRecovery vials (Waters).\nInject and load 3 μL of the reconstituted samples on C18 columns (e.g., trapping column: particle size = 3 μm, C18, length = 20 mm; analytical column: particle size = 1.7 μm, C18, length = 50 cm) using an Ultimate 3000 RSLC nano (using the LC-gradients described in the “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]” section).\nIonize the eluting peptides via a nanoESI source and detect them using a Thermo Scientific Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (using the MS-parameters described in the “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]” section).\nRaw data processing\nTiming: 1 day–1 week; depending on samples",
    "To extract quantitative information, MS raw-files are processed using dedicated software tools. In this protocol we describe the use of the open-source program MaxQuant (Cox and Mann, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]), but any other proteomics software platform (e.g., Proteome Discoverer, PEAKS, MS Fragger, MetaMorpheus) can be used alternatively.\nProcess raw files using the open-source software MaxQuant. Data analyses of the phosphoproteome and the total proteome are performed in separate sessions. Differences in the analyses are stated in the text. If not indicated otherwise, the MaxQuant default parameters are used.\nImport the raw-files of the phosphoproteome or total proteome (“Raw data” > “Load”).\nAssign a distinct sample name for each file (“Raw data” > “Set experiment”) indicating condition and replicate.\nDownload a sequence database for Rattus norvecigus from UniProtKB (uniprot.org[href=http://uniprot.org]) and import it into MaxQuant (“Global parameters” > “Sequences”).\nSet false-discovery rates (FDR) to 0.01 on protein, peptide and site level and a minimum of one unique peptide for protein identification (“Global parameters” > “Identification”).\nUse a precursor mass tolerance of 4.5 ppm (“Group-specific parameters” > “Instrument”). For MS2 spectra acquired in the ion trap, use a fragment mass tolerance of 0.5 Da (“Global parameters” > “MS/MS - ITMS”). For MS2 spectra acquired in the orbitrap, use a fragment mass tolerance of 20 ppm (“Global parameters” > “MS/MS - FTMS”).\nFor total proteome analyses, quantify proteins in a label-free approach (LFQ) using unique peptides. To perform pair-wise ratio determination, use at least two common peptides in at least three consecutive full scans identification (“Global parameters” > “Protein quantification”; “Group-specific parameters” > “Instrument”).\nFor phosphoproteome analyses, assign variable phosphorylation on serine, threonine and tyrosine (“Group-specific parameters” > “Modification”).\nUse the “phospho(STY)site” output-table to analyse the phosphoproteome on the level of phosphorylation events.",
    "Use the “proteinGroups” output-table to analyse the total proteome on the level of proteins.\nNote: The processing time of MaxQuant depends on the number and size of the raw-files, accessible computer power and speed of the hard drive or network (if files are not stored locally). The number of threads or processors used for computation can be adjusted manually. Each thread requires a size of at least 2 GB RAM."
