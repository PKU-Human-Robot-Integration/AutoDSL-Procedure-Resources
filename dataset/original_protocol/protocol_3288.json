    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe following protocol is designed to work ideally with a self-sporulating haploid h90 strain or with a cross between sexually compatible strains of h– and h+ haploid cells.\nRevive cells\nTiming: 1–2 days\nThis step involves monitoring the transition of cells from a physiologically dormant state in a glycerol stock to a state of active metabolism and growth on a solid, nutrient-rich medium plate.\nTake a small amount of frozen biomass from the glycerol stock of cells (approximately the size of a grain of rice) and place it onto a plate of solid rich medium, such as supplemented yeast extract (YES) medium (e.g., YE5S).10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10],11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]\nLeave the biomass to thaw and dry completely.\nIncubate the plate at a temperature of 25ºC to 32ºC, depending on the requirements of the genetic background (e.g., thermosensitivity), for 1–2 days until a patch of biomass grows.\nStarter culture\nTiming: 12–16 h\nCells are transferred from a suboptimal physiological condition for survival and proliferation on a solid, nutrient-rich medium plate to an optimal state of growth in a liquid, nutrient-rich medium.\nTake a small amount of the grown biomass (approximately the size of a grain of rice) and inoculate it into 5–10 mL of liquid YES medium in a 25–50 mL Erlenmeyer flask.\nIncubate the culture at a temperature of 25ºC to 30ºC at 200 rpm, depending on the requirements of the genotype (e.g., thermosensitivity), until it reaches saturation, which is typically indicated by an optical density of 1.\nPartial nutrient starvation\nTiming: 16–20 h\nIn order to achieve a more synchronized induction of meiosis, cells are subjected to partial glucose starvation by reducing its concentration from 3% to 1%.",
    "Dilute the pre-culture in a new flask in a total volume of 10 mL of fresh MM with 1% glucose and growth the culture for approximately 16–20 h until it reaches an optical density of 0.6–0.8.\nCritical: Allow the cultures to grow for a minimum of two additional generations.\nCritical: Do not dilute this pre-culture (in MM 1% Glucose) to initial O.D lower than 0.01 since poor fission yeast inocule could result in problems to resume growth.\nMeiosis induction\nTiming: 4–6 h\nThe initiation of the meiotic program in cells is triggered when nitrogen is entirely absent from the medium.\nNote: We have chosen MEA medium over other sporulating media (such as SPM or SPA), since we have obtained a more robust synchronisation, i.e., a higher percentage of meiocytes after 4–6 h of incubation. As the exchange of mating factors between cells of opposite sexual types is more effective in a solid medium, the most synchronous induction of cell conjugation is attained by growing the cells in liquid culture under partial glucose deprivation and then plating them out onto solid medium.\nTransfer the culture from its current vessel to a 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge the culture at 1000 × g for 3 min.\nCarefully discard the supernatant from the centrifuged culture and then wash the pellet by pipetting an equal volume of minimal medium without nitrogen, MM-N (2% glucose) onto the pellet.\nNote: We use MM-N for the washes and for the filmation since it is crucial to maintain the cells in nutrient-poor conditions (specially deprivation of N) to ensure the progression of the meiotic program throughout prophase and meiotic divisions, otherwise, if a nutrient-rich medium is used, meiocytes could abort such meiotic program and return to vegetative growth.",
    "Centrifuge the culture once again at 1000 × g for 3 min.\nDiscard the supernatant from the centrifuged culture and use a pipette to remove any remaining liquid.\nResuspend the pellet in 100–150 μL of liquid MM-N, adjusting the volume according to the size of the pellet.\nPlace a 10 μL drop of the resuspended pellet onto a plate of MEA medium and allow the drop to dry.\nIncubate the plate at a temperature of 28°C for 4–6 h.\nNote: Zygotes typically start to appear after approximately 4 h of incubation at 28°C, but this timeframe may vary depending on the strain, incubation temperature, and medium used for conjugation. Temperatures between 25°C and 30°C can be used. Other solid media, such as Sporulation Agar (SPA) medium, can be used for meiosis induction, but in our experience, MEA enables better synchronous and efficient meiocyte formation than SPA.\nSample preparation for microscopy\nTiming: 15 min\nFollowing meiosis induction, meiocytes are moved and immobilized within a microscopy chamber for time-lapse fluorescence microscopy.\nNote: The selection of the microscopy chamber format depends on whether a small or large volume of medium is needed, which in turn may be affected by factors such as the inclusion of drugs in the sample. To accommodate both scenarios, we include instructions for both the iBidi 8-well μ-slide (for low volume) and the iBidi 35mm high μ-Dish (for high volume) here.\nAdd 10 μL (iBidi 8-well)-50 μL (iBidi 35 mm high μ-Dish) of soy lectin (1 mg/mL) to the center of the chamber bottom and allow it to settle for 2 min.\nUse a pipette to extract as much of the lectin as possible from the chamber, then allow the remaining residue to air dry.",
    "Using a 1 mL pipette tip, gently resuspend a small amount of biomass from the MEA plate (approximately the size of half a grain of rice) in 300 μL of MM-N.\nImmobilize the cells by placing 100 μL of the prepared suspension onto the lectin-coated microscopy chamber and allow it to settle for 4 min.\nWash away the non-immobilized cells (i.e., cells that are suspended and not adhered to the bottom of the chamber by lectin):\nFor the iBidi 8-well μ-slide:\nAdd 300 μL of fresh MM-N from one side of the well towards the cell spot at the bottom of the well, in order to wash away the loosely adhered cells, while the strongly adhered cells will remain immobilized.\nDiscard the 300 μL of washing medium.\nFor the iBidi 35 mm high μ-Dish:\nAdd 1 mL of fresh MM-N from one side of the dish towards the cell spot at the bottom of the dish, to wash away the non-immobilized cells.\nRepeat this step 3 times, discarding the washing medium.\nAdd either 300 μL of MM-N for the iBidi 8-well μ-slide, or 1 mL for the iBidi 35 mm high μ-Dish.\nNote: To maintain nitrogen deprivation during the timelapse experiment, ensuring the continuation of the meiotic program (prophase and meiotic divisions).\nFluorescence microscopy timelapse\nTiming: 5–6 h\nTiming: 30 min -1 h (for steps 22 to 29)\nTiming: 5 h (for step 30)\nTo observe specific structures like chromosomes and microtubules throughout the meiotic process, particularly using endogenous fluorescent protein tags, we employ fluorescence microscopy.",
    "Note: To facilitate optimal image acquisition, set the required temperature in the microscope (28°C for efficient meiotic progression) at least 3 h before starting the timelapse. This gives the microscope sufficient time to reach the required temperature and allows it to maintain this temperature throughout the timelapse.\nPrepare the necessary hardware for your microscopy system.\nNote: We have used various microscopy systems for our research, including the Confocal Spinning Disk Dragonfly system by Andor-Oxford Instruments, the Confocal Spinning Disk system by Nikon, and the DeltaVision system by Applied Precision.\nInitiate your microscopy software program.\nNote: The image acquisition software used varies depending on the microscopy system. For example, the Confocal Spinning Disk Dragonfly system by Andor-Oxford Instruments uses Fusion, the Confocal Spinning Disk system by Nikon uses Metamorph by Molecular Devices LLC, and the DeltaVision system by Applied Precision uses SoftWorx.\nSelect the 100× objective (with immersion oil capability) on your microscope and apply a drop of immersion oil onto the objective.\nNote: Coming into contact with immersion oil may lead to skin irritation.\nInsert the microscopy chamber into the microscope stage with the appropriate adapter, ensuring that the medium is accessible (for adding drugs if necessary).\nCritical: this product (micro-slide 8 well slide, Ibidi) is only compatile with certain immersion oils (see compatible oils in product instructions or on www.ibidi.com[href=http://www.ibidi.com]). Otherwise, the slides could crack.\nMove the objective towards the bottom of the chamber until you reach the focal plane where the cells are immobilized.\nChoose multiple positions throughout the spot of previously immobilized cells (steps 15-20), seeking for obtaining the maximum number of meiocytes per field, which will depend on the efficiency of meiotic induction for each given strain (e.g., 2–5 meiocytes per field in our hands).",
    "Note: Choosing positions containing the maximum number of meiocytes is strongly advised, since it will increase the efficiency of data acquisition during the timelapse.\nNote: Choosing positions that are as close as possible to each other, as long as they are not overlapping, will reduce the time spent travelling between positions. This will maximize the number of positions that can be imaged for a given acquisition rate and/or minimize the acquisition rate.\nCritical: You ought to familiarize yourself with the setup of your microscopy system and the risk of photobleaching or phototoxicity due to fluorescence cross-incidence radiation between close positions.\nNote: For example, to optimize the path between selected positions, microscopy software such as Fusion provides built-in algorithms. If your software lacks this option, you can implement a script that uses external or custom algorithms such as the nearest-neighbour method.12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]\nConfirm that all positions remain in focus using a brightfield view before initiating the timelapse. If not, re-focus the correspondent position.\nNote: Re-focusing all the taken positions before initiating the timelapse is important because as the last position is acquired, the first few positions may have become slightly defocused.\nActivate the required laser lines and ensure they are passing through the sample.\nIn cases where you need to use drugs at the time of the filmation, add the necessary volume of drug to the medium before starting the timelapse.",
    "Critical: Ensure that the drug is added on top of the medium surface to prevent the generation of flow currents that could detach cells from the chamber bottom. It is important to avoid hitting the chamber with the pipette, as it can cause the selected positions to drift apart. It is recommended that during the addition of the drug, you monitor a live brightfield view of a selected position to check for drifting.\nNote: For example, we have used fast-acting drug-based systems at the time of filmation, when meiocytes are progressing through meiotic prophase, such that it is ensured that the effect of the drug is achieved before the formation of the spindle in meiosis I and II, to study the impact of these on spindle formation and/or function. For example, we have used the auxin-induced degron system to deplete specific proteins and latrunculin A to disrupt the F-actin network in this context, adding the drug just before starting the timelapse, with no incubation periods.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]\nInitiate the timelapse acquisition.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3057_12.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3057_13.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3057_14.csv\nNote: For example, with the Confocal Spinning Disk Dragonfly system, we can record ten positions, using an acquisition rate of 5 min-1 and taking 14 Z planes with a spacing of 0.4 μm between them covering three fluorescence channels during a total recording time of 5 h. This allows us to avoid significant bleaching and phototoxicity while ensuring that meiotic progression of meiocytes is not compromised. The fluorophores we have used are all endogenous (protein fusions) and they comprise CFP, GFP and m-Cherry. Please, refer to the Tables 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1], 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2], and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] for further explanation on the settings of the timelapse, which are strongly dependent on the microscopy system used.",
    "Note: It is advisable to verify if the selected acquisition rate is sufficient to capture images of all positions and to provide enough time to refocus positions during acquisition rounds.\nNote: As temperature changes can cause defocusing, it is advisable to refocus all selected positions after adding a drug, as it may be at a different temperature than the medium or the microscope. Furthermore, periodic refocusing of selected positions may be necessary due to fluctuations in the microscope temperature.\nNote: For example, the Confocal Spinning Disk Dragonfly system is equipped with the Perfect Focus System (PFS) feature, which automatically refocuses positions before each acquisition event. The PFS measures the difference between the current and initial coordinates (reference) using infrared light. If you are using a different microscopy system that does not have this feature, you may need to manually refocus the positions in the spare time between acquisition rounds.\nFluorescence imaging quality control\nTiming: 15 min (for steps 31 to 34)\nExamine the acquired microscopy images to ensure they meet a set of criteria essential for subsequent analysis.\nTo obtain an initial overview of the timelapse, create a maximum projection of all Z planes for each position across all time points.\nNote: This can be achieved using the microscopy software or other image analysis software, such as ImageJ. Macros or plugins can be used to automate the process. The outcome will be a stack consisting of slices that display the maximum projection of each corresponding time point.",
    "Note: For example, the files obtained from timelapse acquisition with Fusion and Softworx software contain separate Z planes of all time points, while Metamorph generates separate files for each Z plane of each time point together with an .nd file that contains image metadata and an index of all generated files. Regardless of the acquisition software used, the maximum projections can be obtained using the open-source software ImageJ (also known as FIJI), along with the plugin \"Metamorphnd& ROI files importer (nd stack builder)\" (mm_nd_and_roi_pack.jar).\nCarefully review the entire timelapse for any events that could affect the microscopy analysis, such as defocusing, drifting in the XY or Z planes, bleaching, phototoxicity, disturbances in meiotic progression, and other similar issues. These events can affect the quality and accuracy of the data, so it is crucial to address them before proceeding with any further analysis.\nVerify that the range of acquired Z planes covers the entire vertical range of fluorescently labeled structures for each channel.\nNote: This can be achieved by ensuring that the uppermost and lowermost Z planes do not detect the fluorescence signal of the structure whereas the remaining planes do.\nEnsure that the number and spacing of the acquired Z planes are appropriate to cover the entire fluorescent signal seamlessly. To do this, examine each individual plane and ensure that there is minimal overlap of the signal captured by that plane and its adjacent planes in the maximum projection.\nNote: This ensures that no signal is missed within the correct vertical range. This redundancy in signal capture also aids in identifying potential issues such as XY/Z drift or other artifacts when analyzing the maximum projection.",
    "Note: Performing checks is particularly crucial when imaging the spindle. As the spindle is a thin structure that can elongate significantly throughout the length of the cell, capturing the entire spindle body without gaps requires an adequate number and range of planes.\nSelf-assembled spindle analysis\nTiming: 5 h (for steps 35 to 38)\nIdentify appropriate meiocytes and conduct an analysis of the structures of interest, primarily focusing on chromosomes and microtubules (the spindle).\nIdentify the meiotic cells (meiocytes) among the vegetative cells by looking for cells that are larger in size and have a bent shape (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3057-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Prerequisites for selecting suitable meiocytes for analyzing spindle formation\nThe necessary conditions for fluorescence microscopy analysis of SPB-dependent and self-assembled spindles in fission yeast meiosis include obtaining and selecting meiocytes that are the required type and are in the appropriate stage of meiosis.\nEvaluate the quality of the meiocytes, classifying each one in each position in the timelapse as suitable or unsuitable according to the following criteria:\nMeiocytes that are suitable (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) include:\nMeiocytes that result from complete fusion of mating cells and exhibit a bent shape with a thick middle part, which indicates the presence of a thick bridge joining the mating cells.\nMeiocytes that have successfully completed karyogamy, resulting in the fusion of the nuclei of the mating cells into a single nucleus.",
    "Meiocytes in the meiotic prophase stage, where the nucleus is surrounded by several fibers of astral microtubules that span the entire cytoplasm and oscillate between both tips of the meiocyte. In a wild-type case, the oscillating forces of microtubules are transmitted to the nucleus through the connection between telomeres and the SPB, resulting in horsetail movement where the nucleus follows this oscillatory movement. However, in the genetic background required for self-assembled spindle formation, the telomeres/centromeres are not connected to the SPB, causing the nucleus to not follow the oscillatory movement (and thus no horsetail movement). Observing meiocytes in the meiotic prophase stage guarantees that the subsequent proper spindle formation has not yet occurred.\nMeiocytes that are not suitable (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) include:\nMeiocytes that are formed early or immaturely, with unfused or partially fused mating cells that display an intact cell wall or a thin bridge between them. This can be observed through the brightfield channel.\nMeiocytes that may have correct cell fusion but have incomplete or partial fusion of the mating nuclei (karyogamy). This can be observed using fluorescent labeling of chromosomes, such as histone proteins.\nMeiocytes that are in a late meiotic phase, such as post-prophase, with several microtubule fibers surrounding the still nucleus at the center of the meiocyte or during the meiotic divisions (meiosis I or II), with the spindle already formed. In such cases, several structures may require labeling, including the nucleus (chromosomes or nuclear envelope) together with microtubules, depending on the observation method used.\nIn our hands, we have not found any association between successful of meiosis progression or expected spindle behavior and the size of meiocytes. The final size of the meiocytes are the result of the size of the parental cells whose mating give rise to the meiocyte.",
    "Note: To ensure that karyogamy is complete and stable and that nuclear movement is concordant with the background, it is recommended that the timelapse captures a minimum period of meiotic prophase (e.g., 30 min to 1 h). However, as the meiotic divisions span several hours, especially in the wild-type case, it is convenient to capture only the end of the meiotic prophase and not its entire duration.\nIdentify the window of time in which the spindle forms.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3057-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Examples of SPB-dependent spindles and self-assembled spindles in fission yeast meiosis\n(A) Representative images of spindle and chromosome dynamics in a wild-type setting, where SPB-dependent spindles are formed.\n(B) Representative images of spindle and chromosome dynamics in a bqt1Δ sad1.2 mutant, where self-assembled spindles are formed. (A and B) Time stamps indicate the first frame in which spindle microtubules nucleate from a tubulin focus at the onset of meiosis I. The scale bars at the right of each panel represent 5 μm. The images are captured using fluorescent markers, where tubulin is labeled with leu1+::SV40-GFP-atb2 and chromosomes are labeled with hht1-RFP.",
    "Note: Observe the very end of the meiotic prophase, when the oscillating astral microtubules limit their movement and migrate from the tips to the center of the meiocyte, surrounding the static nucleus. As the microtubule fibers are dismantled, the nucleus will condense, and eventually microtubule filaments will begin to form within the nucleus, indicated by the tubulin signal in the vicinity of the chromosome signal. These filaments assemble into a rod-shaped bipolar structure, with a midbody and two poles, known as the spindle assembly. The spindle will then elongate, and the chromosomes will be segregated along the spindle axis in opposite directions. Finally, the microtubules comprising the spindle will dismantle, resulting in the spindle disassembly, and the chromosomes will remain separated in several masses (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nMeasure the length of the spindle body (see the quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis] section)."
