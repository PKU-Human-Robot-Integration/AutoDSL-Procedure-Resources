    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nICV injection of CD4+ GFP T cells\nTiming: 40–50 min/mouse\nNote: This protocol describes the procedure for injection of one mouse.\nAnesthetize the mouse in the induction chamber filled with 2% isoflurane.\nCritical: Confirm sufficient anesthesia by assessing the foot-pinch response.\nOnce the mouse is anesthetized, clean the head area with a cotton tipped applicator soaked in 70% ethanol, avoiding the eye area.\nUsing a scalpel, make a vertical incision down the center of the head, starting between the eyes, and use a cotton tipped applicator to expose the skull and dry the area.\nNote: Be careful not to damage the skull with the scalpel.\nPlace the mouse in the stereotaxic apparatus (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A), positioning the nose in the anesthesia adaptor, with a constant flow of 2% isoflurane, and tighten the ear bar on the right-hand-side until the head is firmly in place.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/908-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic of ICV injection apparatus and mouse skull exposure\n(A) Set-up of the mouse in the stereotaxic apparatus for the injection of CD4+ T cells.\n(B) An exposed mouse skull showing the reference points, bregma (1), interaural line (2) and lambda (3), used for the correct positioning of the injection site.\nNote: The position of the left-hand-side ear bar is set at the start of all the injections and should not be adjusted throughout the injections.\nCritical: Place mouse over the heating pad to prevent hypothermia during the procedure.\nLubricate the mouse's eyes with Viscotears Liquid Gel to prevent corneal dryness.\nInsert the drill into the holder of the stereotaxic apparatus.\nNote: Ensure the drill is correctly inserted into the holder. If not, the drill can move during drilling and damage the brain or drill the hole in the wrong area.",
    "Using the drill, ensure the bregma and lambda are on the same horizontal plane. For this, gently place the tip of the drill at the bregma position. Set the dorsoventral axis to zero mm on the stereotaxic apparatus. Raise the tip of the drill and move directly down to the Lambda position. Lower the tip of the drill to the skull. If the dorsoventral axis is now ≤ 0.1 mm, the head of the mouse is straight. If not, adjust the position of the head and repeat until the bregma and lambda are on the same horizontal plane.\nCritical: Ensure the head is in the correct position and stable to achieve injection to the ventricles.\nOnce the head is straight, drill two small holes in the skull, just large enough for the needle to pass through and infiltrate the brain surface. Follow the coordinates measured from the bregma, to reach the lateral ventricles: −0.5 mm in the anteroposterior axis, ±1 mm in the mediolateral axis and −2.3 mm in the dorsoventral axis (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/908-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Outline of bilateral ICV injection procedure\n(A) ICV injection coordinates showing the reference points, bregma and lambda.\n(B) The skull is exposed by incising the skin.\n(C) Two holes are drilled in the skull, using the bregma and lambda as reference points.\n(D) The cells are ICV injected.\n(E) The skin is closed using a metal suture clip.\nCritical: Be careful not to cause brain damage.",
    "Note: Stereotactic coordinates are optimized for 2-month-old mice and older (Allen Brain Atlas). The injection range for the dorsoventral axis is −2.3 to −3 mm. It is optimal to calibrate this coordinate for your specific mice prior to experiments, as it might change depending on the mouse strain and age. This can be achieved by injecting a dye at different coordinates in the dorsoventral axis. A successful injection is identified by the presence of the injected dye in the lateral ventricles.\nPrepare cells for injection by adding 1 mL of PBS to a previously prepared aliquot. Centrifuge at 500 g for 5 min at 20°C. Remove the supernatant and suspend in 2.5 μL PBS.\nNote: Prior to experiment cells are prepared in aliquots and kept on ice.\nLoad the Hamilton syringe, holding either the 26 G or 30 G needle, with the desired treatment (here transduced CD4+ GFP T cells suspended in PBS) and place it in the arm of the stereotaxic device connected to an automated microinjection system. For control mice, inject 2.5 μL of PBS or control cells suspended in PBS, to lateral ventricle of the brain.\nCritical: Ensure there are no air bubbles in the syringe.\nPosition the syringe over the first hole, lower the needle until it is touching the brain, and set the dorsoventral axis to zero mm.\nVery slowly lower the needle to −2.3 mm in the dorsoventral axis.\nSet the infusion pump to administer the injection at a rate of 1 μL per minute.\nOnce the infusion is finished, wait for 2 min before raising the needle slowly to −1.15 mm in the dorsoventral axis. Then, wait 1 min before slowly raising the needle out of the hole.",
    "Critical: Always wait the recommended time before raising the needle and raise the needle slowly to minimize backflow.\nBased on your experimental design, repeat the same procedure for the second lateral ventricle.\nClose the incision using a stainless steel wound clip.\nNote: It is recommended to use an appropriate analgesic post-injection, for example, buprenorphine 0.05 mg/kg subcutaneously.\nReturn the mouse back to the colony.\nMonitor the mouse until it wakes up and moves around normally.\nPreparation of brain sections for immunohistochemistry\nTiming: 5–6 days\nSacrifice the mouse 72 h post injection.\nPerfuse the mouse with 10 mL cold PBS.\nNote: Perfusion was important for our experimental setup as we were interested in locating the brain-infiltrating injected cells and not the injected cells located within the brain vasculature.\nHarvest the brain.\nIn a 15 mL centrifuge tube, suspend the brain in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h at 4°C.\nSwitch to 30% sucrose in PBS solution for 48 h, or until the brain has sunk to the bottom of the 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nPause point: The brain can be left immersed in 30% sucrose at 4°C for up to 5 days.\nEmbed in O.C.T. compound and freeze blocks at −20°C.\nPause point: O.C.T. blocks can be stored at −80°C for up to 6 months.\nUsing the microtome, cut brains to 40 μm sections.\nIn a 48 well plate, rinse the tissues in 0.5% Triton in PBS solution for 30 min.\nRinse tissue twice with PBST for 5 min.\nTransfer the tissues to DAPI 1:3000 in PBS and incubate for 5 min.\nRinse the tissues with PBST for 5 min.\nTransfer the tissue onto a slide. Once they have dried, add anti-fade fluorescence mounting medium and cover the sections with a cover slip.",
