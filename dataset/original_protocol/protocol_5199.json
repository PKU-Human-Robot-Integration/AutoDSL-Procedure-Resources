    "Dissection of musclesTools used to dissect muscles of mice are shown in Figure 1A. Video 1 shows how to dissect muscles from a mouse. Position the mouse supine on a dissection board (Styrofoam board) and secure the leg with a T-pin (Figure 1B). Peel off the leg skin to expose the hind limb muscles. Expose tendons of tibialis anterior (TA) muscle and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle (Figure 1B). Gently remove the fascia covering the TA muscle. Cut the distal TA tendon and use it to peel off the TA muscle. Carefully remove the TA muscle at its proximal attachment (Figure 1C). After removing the TA muscle, cut distal EDL muscle and peel off the EDL muscle. Carefully cut the proximal EDL tendon and remove the EDL muscle. To dissect soleus muscle (SOL), position the mouse prone on a dissection board and secure the leg with a T-pin (Figure 1D). Cut the tendon of gastrocnemius (GA) muscle and use it to peel off the GA muscle till the exposure of a SOL tendon (Figure 1E). Cut the SOL tendon and use it to peel off the SOL muscle (Figure 1F). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170511/20170511200909_6223.jpgFigure 1.

Dissection of skeletal muscles from a mouse Embedding of muscleAfter dissection, skeletal muscles (e.g., tibialis anterior, soleus, extensor digitorum longus) are embedded in embedding molds (e.g., SPI Supplies) with minimum amount of Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound possible to cover the muscles (Figure 1G).",
    "Place a cold-resistant beaker of 2-methylbutane into a slurry of dry ice and ethanol (pure), which allows fast cooling to -78 °C. When the correct temperature is attained, no bubble will appear after putting a piece of dry ice into the 2-methylbutane. Freeze the embedded muscle by placing it into the cooled 2-methylbutane for 5 min and then transfer the muscle sample to a -80 °C freezer for storage.CryosectioningBefore cryosectioning, the cryostat with the blade is pre-cooled to -22 ± 2 °C. Samples are placed in cryostat for at least 20 min for thermal equilibration. Attach the sample on the round metallic holders of the cryostat with Tissue-Tek O.C.T. Make 10 µm-thick sections and collect them on room temperature positive charged microscope slides and then store the slides in a slide box in a -80 °C freezer. These slides can be processed further for H&E staining or immunostaining.H&E stainingBring the slides from the -80 °C freezer to room temperature.Incubate the slides with hematoxylin solution in a staining jar for 10 min to stain the nuclei.Transfer the slides to a staining jar with running water (tap water is fine) till the water is clear.Transfer the slides to a staining jar with Eosin solution for 3 min.Successively transfer the slides into staining jars with 70% ethanol for 20 sec, 90% ethanol for 20 sec, 100% ethanol for 1 min and xylene for 3 min.Take out slides from xylene and place the slides in a fume hood till the slides are dry.Mount the slides with xylene-based mounting media and cover with cover slides. Clips are used to press the slides to squeeze bubbles.Store the slides at room temperature.Hematoxylin and Eosin-stained images were captured with a 14.",
    "0 MP digital microscope camera which is attached via a c-mount to the side port of a Leica DMI 6000B microscope.Immunostaining with MyHC antibodiesBring the slides from the -80 °C freezer to room temperature and surround the sections with a liquid blocker (Ted Pella) to limit the usage of the incubation solutions.Place the slides in a wet chamber (Note 5) and block the sections with blocking buffer for at least 30 min at room temperature. For the immunostaining with MyHC antibodies from DSHB, do not fix samples or sections with fixative solution (this is specifically for the MyHC antibodies).Dilute primary antibodies with blocking buffer. Myh2, Myh4 and Myh7 antibodies are diluted at a ratio 1:300. Dystrophin antibody is diluted at a ratio 1:1,000. Remove blocking buffer from the sections and add diluted primary antibodies on sections. Place the slides in a wet chamber overnight at 4 °C.Dilute secondary antibodies with PBS at a ratio 1:1,000. Incubate secondary antibodies with sections for 30 min to 1 h at room temperature. Slides are placed in a wet chamber.Wash the slides with PBS for 5 times. Before mounting the slides, remove PBS as much as possible, but keep sections wet.Mount the slides with immunostaining mounting media and cover with cover slides. Clips are used to press the slides to squeeze bubbles. Seal the slides with clear nail polish.Store the slides at 4 °C.Fluorescent images were captured using the Leica DMI 6000B fluorescent microscope."
