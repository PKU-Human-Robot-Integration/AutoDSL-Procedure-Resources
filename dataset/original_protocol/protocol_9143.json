    "1.  Preparations Prior to Electroporation\nAmplify the DNA for electroporation by a maxi prep (Prime-It or Qiagen).  The concentration of the DNA should be a minimum of 1 mg/mL for efficient uptake.\nRemove 495 μL of DNA and mix with 5 μl of 0.01% Fast Green in 1 X PBS (phosphate buffered saline) in a microcentrifuge tube.  \n2.   Embryonic Harvest\nEstablish timed matings of CD-1 mice (Harlan).  Check for the presence of vaginal plugs and regard the date a vaginal plug is observed as embryonic day (E) 0.5.  Embryos will be harvested 11 days after visualizing plug (E11.5).\nPlace sterilized tools in 70% ethanol.  Treat a laminar flow hood with UV light for at least one hour prior to use.  Spray hood, dissecting tray, and dissecting scope with 70% ethanol.  Pre-heat 1 X PBS to 37 °C.\nOn E11.5 euthanize the female according to conditions approved by the Institutional Committee for the Care and Use of Animals (ICCUA).  Place dissecting tray in the laminar flow hood.  Spray down the abdomen of the female with 70% ethanol.  \nOpen the peritoneal cavity and pin the walls to the dissecting tray. Pull out the uterine horns so that it rests within the peritoneal cavity.\nCarefully cut open the wall of the uterine horn.  Use a 20 mm spoon (Fine Scientific Tools) to gently remove the embryo in the yolk sac away from the placenta.  Place embryos into a 100 mm tissue culture dish prefilled with 10 mL of sterile 1 X PBS that was preheated in 2.2.\nRepeat for all embryos present.\n3.  Electroporation of E11.5 Embryos (Figure 1)\nUsing a 20 mm spoon, transfer the first embryo to a new 100 mm dish prefilled with 10 mL of sterile 1XPBS that was preheated to 37 °C.",
    "Use 11 cm forceps with a 0.05 x 0.02 mm tip (Fine Scientific Tools) to carefully remove and discard the yolk sac.\nPosition embryo so that its dorsal side is facing up so that it resembles the cartoon in Figure 1A.  Use 7 mm electrode paddles (Harvard Apparatus) to gently hold the embryo.  The electrodes should be positioned at either side of the neural tube at the level of the hindbrain fourth ventricle.  The ventricle is visible to the naked eye but using a dissection microscope can facilitate accurate paddle placement.  Positioning of the paddles is critical to determining the region that receives the electroporated DNA. If the lower rhombic lip (LRL) of the dorsal embryonic hindbrain is desired, paddles must be place such that they are directly flanking the widest part of the fourth ventricle opening.\nUse a 1 cc syringe to draw up the plasmid DNA mixed with 0.01% Fast Green.  500 μL of the mixture should be sufficient for the electroporation of at least 8-10 embryos (see 3.5).\nGently puncture the roofplate overlying the fourth ventricle with a 25G 5/8 tuberculin needle attached to the 1 cc syringe and inject the DNA-dye mixture into the ventricle.  Successful injections are characterized by the DNA-dye mixture filling the entire ventricular system (Figure 1C).  The amount of DNA-dye mixture typically injected is less than 50 μL.  Exact amounts are variable between embryos as a portion of the mixture tends to leak out of ventricle into the PBS surrounding the embryo.  An alternate means of delivering the DNA-dye mixture would be through accessing the ventricular system by puncturing the velum overlying the midbrain.  Again, successful injections are characterized by the DNA-dye mixture filling the entire ventricular system.",
    "Deliver five square pulses using an electric pulse generator (BTX) and 7 mm electrode paddles.  Each pulse is 50 V lasting 5 ms per pulse with 500 ms between each pulse.  The tissue closest to the positively charged electrode will then take up the plasmid.\n4.  Culture of Embryos\nIn a laminar flow hood, fill the outer wells of a 12-well culture dish with 2 mL of DMEM/F12 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% equine serum, 1% glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin that was preheated to 37 °C. The culture conditions were adapted from de Diego and colleagues.15\nIn laminar flow hood pinch embryos at midsection (below the heart) with forceps and remove posterior portion of embryo.  Place the anterior portion into one of the filled wells of the 12-well culture dish. \nRepeat for all embryos.  Fill only the outer wells of the 12-well plate to avoid contamination of cultures.\nCulture embryos in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2.  Expression of the electroporated plasmid should be observable within 24 hr.\nShould longer culture times be desired, fill the out wells of a new 12 well plate with 2 mL of the media used in 4.1.  With a sterilized spoon transfer the embryos to a well in the new plate.  Place back into the 37 °C incubator.  Culture for up to 48 hr is possible.\nWhen the desired culture time is reached, fix embryos for analysis (see below). \n5.  Preparation of Embryos for Analysis\nRinse embryos in 1 X PBS at 4 °C for five min.  Repeat.\nFix embryos for analysis in 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 1XPBS for 2 hours at 4 °C.\nRinse embryos in 1 X PBS at 4 °C for five min.  Repeat.\nEquilibrate embryos in 30% sucrose in 1 X PBS overnight at 4 °C.",
    "Embed embryos in Optimal Cutting Temperature (O.C.T) compound using a dry ice/ethanol bath.  Embryos can be stored at -20 °C.\nSection embryos on a cryostat (Leica) into 30 μm sections and mount on slides (VWR, Superfrost Plus). Store at -20 °C.\n6.  Immunohistochemistry Analysis\nImmunohistochemistry was performed as described in 16. Primary antibody dilutions used for this study include rabbit α-GFP (Invitrogen) 1:2500; mouse α-Mash1 (BD Biosciences) 1:100; rabbit α-Ngn1 (Jane Johnson) 1:5000; rabbit α-Ptf1a (Jane Johnson) 1:2500; rabbit -Math1 (Jane Johnson) 1:100.  Incubate slide flat, specimen side up on a staining tray at 4 °C overnight.\nSlides were analyzed  on a compound microscope (Olympus BX51).\n7. Representative Results\nA schematic in Figure 1A depicts the  electroporation experiment. Figure 1B shows a sagittal view of an E11.5  embryo prior to manipulation.  The same  embryo following injection of the plasmid containing CAG::GFP in 0.01% Fast Green is shown in Figure 1C and a  representative unfixed embryo exhibiting unilateral GFP expression in the dorsal hindbrain 24 hr following culture is  shown in Figure 1D.  The extent of  the area of the LRL that is successfully electroporated is variable and appears  to be highly dependent on positioning of the electrodes.  In our studies it was found that 52 out of 65  (80%) of the electroporated embryos successfully expressed GFP. Tissue was deemed to be successfully electroporated if it was  positive for GFP in localized regions over several sections following fixation  and immunohistochemical analysis (see below).   Embryos that failed to meet this criteria were scored as unsuccessful  attempts at electroporation.",
    "Further assessment of electroporation efficiency can  be ascertained by performing immunohistochemistry against GFP on transverse  sections of electroporated embryos at the level of the fourth ventricle.  Figure 2 shows representative serial  sections from an embryo displaying unilateral GFP expression.  Figure 2A shows an idealized schematic  that illustrates that the left side of the embryo was toward the positive  electrode.  Transverse sections (at  levels represented by the middle cartoon of Figure 2A) reveal localized  GFP expression exclusively on the left side of the hindbrain tissue (Figures  2C and 2D).  The electroporated area  of the LRL did not extend the entire anterior-posterior axis of the neural tube  as examination of sections 300 μm rostral or  greater to that shown in Figure 2C does not express GFP (Figure 2B).\nThe utility of this assay for manipulation of gene expression is dependent upon the stability of the expression domains for the endogenous proteins.  The LRL has been characterized as possessing unique progenitor domains characterized by the differential expression of proneural transcription factors (reviewed in 1).  A subset of these factors (Mash1, Math1, Ngn1, and Ptf1a) were chosen for analysis due to their proposed and/or characterized roles in the specification of precerebellar neural subtypes in the LRL, a subject of future studies 16-18.  All four proteins have highly characteristic expression domains in the caudal hindbrain at E11.5 16-18. We observed that embryos that were placed cultures failed to increase in size and also failed to initiate production of choroid plexus epithelium and invagination of the LRL and roofplate, morphological events that occur between E11.5 and E12.5 5.  Based on these observations it was determined that normal development in these embryos was halted or grossly delayed and the comparable control for the cultured embryos should be uncultured embryos at E11.5.",
    "To ensure that culture and electroporation do not  disturb levels of endogenous proteins, we analyzed four different proteins by  immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 34 different embryos that were electroporated and  then cultured for at least 24 hr.  Table  I shows the number of embryos analyzed for each marker and the percentage  of the embryos analyzed that retained normal protein levels.  Figure 3 shows representative IHC data  from two of the proteins analyzed, Mash1 (Figures 3A and 3B)  and Math1 (Figures 3C and 3D).  We  observed that the majority of the embryos retained normal levels of expression  following electroporation and culture (Figures 3B and 3D) as compared to  the control embryos at E11.5 (Figures 3A and 3C).  Importantly, the characteristic expression  domains of these proteins were not perturbed.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3983/3983fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.
