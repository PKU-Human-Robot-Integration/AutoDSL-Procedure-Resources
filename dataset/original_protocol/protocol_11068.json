    "All studies were conducted within the guidelines of the Animal Ethics Committee of The University of Queensland (UQCCR/186/19), and the Australian Code for the Care and Use of Animals for Science Purpose.\n1. Preparation of cancer cells for injection\nNOTE: In this study, the human breast cancer cell line, BT-474 (BT474), was used. BT474 was cultured in complete growth medium comprising RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% insulin. The cells were maintained in an incubator at 37 °C with 5% carbon dioxide in air atmosphere. Authenticate the cell line by satellite tandem repeats testing35, confirm expression of the reporter protein (e.g., luciferase) if any, and check for mycoplasma infection.\nSeed BT474 cancer cells at a seeding density of 2.0 x 106 cells into a T75 flask using 10 mL of complete growth media and culture (at 37 °C with 5% CO2) to 70%-80% confluency prior to injection.\nOn the day of injection, discard growth media and wash the cell monolayer with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) twice.\nAdd 5 mL of prewarmed cell culture dissociation reagent (see Table of Materials) and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min or until cells have detached. After 5 min, gently tap the flask to aid cell detachment.\nAdd 5 mL of complete growth media containing 10% fetal bovine serum to quench the dissociation reagent activity.\nGently resuspend the cells by pipetting to reduce cell clumps.\nTransfer the cell suspension into a 50 mL tube and centrifuge at 180 x g for 3 min at room temperature.\nDecant the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 10 mL of Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) without calcium and magnesium to minimize cell clumping.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 180 x g for 3 min at room temperature.",
    "Decant the supernatant to remove residual serum/dissociation reagent and resuspend the cell pellet in 3 mL of HBSS.\nPlace a 100 µm cell strainer on a fresh 50 mL conical tube and pass the cell suspension through to remove cell clumps.\n\tNOTE: A single cell suspension is essential to minimize blood vessel occlusion and the risk of stroke on injection.\nCalculate the number of viable cells using Trypan Blue exclusion and a hemocytometer with standard methods.\nDilute the cell suspension with HBSS to a cell concentration of 2.5 x 106 cells/mL.\nKeep the tube horizontal on ice and gently rock the tube periodically to minimize clumping. The cell suspension can be stored on ice for a maximum of 6 h.\n\t​NOTE: Rocking was done manually but this can also be done using a shaker at low rpm.\n2. Preparation of the mouse for the procedure\nNOTE: In this study, 4-5 weeks old, female NOD scid mice were used. Introduce soft-diet recovery food (e.g., diet gel, hydrogel, mashed mouse chow) to mice 3 days before the procedure to encourage feeding after the procedure.\nAutoclave surgical tools. Spray and wipe down the surgical area and equipment with surface disinfectant, followed by 70% ethanol.\nPlace an animal heat mat under the surgical board to prevent hypothermia. Switch this on 30 min prior to surgery. Spray and wipe down the surgical board with surface disinfectant followed by 70% ethanol.\nPrepare a clean animal housing cage and a warm heating pad for recovery.\nPut on clean personal protective equipment (gown, mask, hairnet, and gloves). Maintain sterility throughout the procedure by using clean exam gloves and a 'instruments tips-only' technique.\nAnesthetize the mouse with an anesthetic chamber using 5% isoflurane with an oxygen flow of 2 L/min until the mouse loses pedal reflex.",
    "Take the animal out of the chamber and place it in a nose cone delivering 2% isoflurane at an oxygen flow of 2 L/min for the remaining surgical procedure.\nEar punch mouse for identification and use electric clippers to shave the fur from the neck region. Clean excess hair from exposed skin using tape.\nWeigh the mouse for calculating the anesthetic and analgesic drug doses required. Administer buprenorphine and meloxicam at 50 µg/kg and 1 mg/kg, respectively, via subcutaneous injection.\nTransfer the mouse to a warm surgical board and secure the nose cone with tape.\nApply ocular lubricant to the eyes to prevent drying.\nSecure the mouse gently by first hooking the upper incisor teeth using thread taped to the surgical board, followed by taping the front and hind legs. This step extends the body and keeps the neck straight during the procedure.\nPerform preoperative skin preparation as described below.\n\t\nWipe the neck with topical antiseptic (povidone-iodine) to reduce skin microflora load and remove loose hair. Clean from the center of the skin, working outward to prevent recontamination of the incision site. Repeat the process using 70% ethanol. Perform three alternating rounds of iodine and ethanol for disinfection.\nLay a surgical drape over the animal. This is cut and fashioned from a piece of sterile paper towel or autoclave bag.\nLay out sterile paper towels or autoclave bags for surgical tools.\nCheck for reflex via 'Pinch test' to ensure sufficient anesthesia before continuing with the procedure.\n3. Internal carotid injection",
    "NOTE: In this experiment, a 31 G infusion cannula and foot-activated syringe-driver setup was utilized to facilitate the injection procedure (Supplementary Figure 1). This setup is optional and the user can use a 31 G insulin syringe and skip steps 3.11 and 3.12. To prepare the infusion cannula, pull and separate the needle portion from the syringe fitting portion of a 31 G needle using two pairs of suture clamps. Next, attach the needle portion to one end of a fine infusion tubing approximately 10 cm in length.\nPosition the dissection microscope over the mouse.\nUsing scissors, make a vertical 15 mm incision along the midline at the neck region starting from 5 mm below the jaw to the thoracic inlet.\nUsing two pairs of angled forceps, part the skin and underlying salivary glands, and apply retractors to keep the trachea exposed. The next step will expose the carotid sheath that lies parallel to the trachea.\nUsing two pairs of fine angled forceps, bluntly dissect the muscle and fat tissue adjacent to the trachea to expose the right carotid sheath. The carotid sheath is the fibrous layer covering the common carotid artery, vein, and vagus nerve, and this bundle can be visualized by the bright red common carotid artery. In this study, the injection was performed on the right carotid artery.\nClear a segment of the common carotid artery caudal to the carotid bifurcation of the surrounding fascia and separate it from the vagus nerve and veins.\nIsolate and clear the carotid bifurcation (the junction that joins the external and internal carotid arteries) from the surrounding nerves and fascia. Position fine forceps under the external carotid artery and pass a silk suture (5-0 thickness) under the artery. Knot and tighten the suture and cut excess line.",
    "NOTE: This ligature (L1) will prevent injectate from transiting through the external carotid artery.\nPosition fine forceps under the common carotid artery and pass a silk suture (5-0 thickness) under the artery. Tie a knot and tighten the suture at a position proximal to the proposed injection site. Cut the excess suture leaving about 10 mm of line.\n\tNOTE: This second ligature (L2) will restrict blood flow and bleeding after injection. It is also used to position and hold the carotid artery during the injection.\nCut and moisten a strip of (autoclaved) low-lint disposable wipers (see Table of Materials) about 10 mm x 5 mm. Fold the strip into 4 mm x 5 mm, 2-3 mm thick, and place it underneath the carotid artery at the proposed site of injection. This will support the vessel during the injection.\nOn the common carotid artery rostral to the proposed injection site, place a third ligation (L3) with a loose knot. This is tightened only after the injection (at step 3.16).\nGently agitate the cell suspension and draw 200 µL of cell suspension into an insulin syringe (with 31 G needle).\nLoad the syringe into the syringe driver that is connected to an activating foot pedal.\nAttach a fine cannula with a 31 G needle to the syringe and prime the line.\nCheck whether the carotid artery is well-positioned and pressurized.\nUsing two fine angled forceps, one gently tensioning onto the end of the first ligature and the other holding the 31 G needle, slowly insert the needle with bevel up into the lumen of the blood vessel taking care not to puncture it.",
    "Slowly inject 100 µL of cell suspension (from step 1.13) into the common carotid artery at 10 µL/s. This will deliver 2.5 x 105 cells into the blood vessel. Successful injection is visualized via the clearing of blood from the carotid blood vessel.\nGently lift and tighten the loose ligature (L3) (from step 3.9) immediately after withdrawing the needle to prevent backflow and bleeding. Trim excess suture.\n\tNOTE: It is normal to observe a small amount of blood spurting after the withdrawal of the needle. However, there must not be any active bleeding after the third ligature is tightened.\nRemove the piece of moistened low-lint disposable wipers.\nUsing a P200 pipette, rinse the surgical cavity twice with 150-200 µL of sterile water or saline.\nCheck again for bleeding, and then remove the retractors.\nReposition the soft tissue, salivary glands, and skin over the carotid artery and trachea.\nClose the skin layer of the incision using a suture needle holder, forceps, and an absorbable or non-absorbable 6/0 monofilament suture in a continuous pattern.\nDiscard the cannula needle syringe and prepare a new setup for the next mouse. Using a new syringe will ensure that the number of cells injected into each mouse is consistent.\n\tNOTE: Representative snapshots of the procedure are in Supplementary Figure 2. If the vessel is punctured or torn by the needle, indicated by the leakage of injectate or bleeding, the procedure is deemed unsuccessful. Following this, the needle must be withdrawn, and the third ligature must be immediately tightened to prevent further bleeding. If bleeding is persistent after tightening of the suture, the animal must be euthanized with pentobarbital.\n4. Post-injection recovery\nInject buprenorphine (50 µg/kg) and meloxicam (1 mg/kg) via subcutaneous injection as post-surgical pain relief.",
    "Move the animal to a warm and clean cage to recover from anesthesia. It is normal for an animal to have subdued activity (huddled and inactive or moving around slowly) after waking up.\nAfter 30-45 min, transfer mice to a long-term holding facility.\nProvide mice with a soft diet (diet gel, hydrogel, mash) for at least a week post-surgery and check physical status daily with special attention for signs of stroke, infection, bleeding around the wound site.\nTwo days post-surgery, it is typical for the animal to have reduced activity, mild ruffled fur and lost 15% of pre-operative body weight. Administer analgesic (meloxicam) daily for 2-3 days post-surgery to manage pain and aid recovery.\nFrom day 3 onwards, animals must have regained activity, increased in feeding and grooming frequency, and regaining weight. Euthanize animals with persisting physical condition deficits (pain, huddled, inactive, weight loss) after 4 days post-surgery by injecting sodium pentobarbital at 200 mg/kg via intraperitoneal injection.\nTumor engraftment and progression can be monitored using anesthesia and imaging modality of choice such as bioluminescent imaging, MRI or PET/MRI. The requirement and ability to undertake such imaging will be inherently dependent on the individual project aims and facility within which it is undertaken, and depending on the type of reporter tag the cell lines used, accessibility of relevant radiochemistry and nuclear imaging facilities36,37\n\tNOTE: Some animals may not respond well and experience a stroke despite a successful procedure. After the procedure, animals that present with any symptoms of neurological distress (turning head and pulling to one side, circling behavior, rolling, thrashing, loss of motor function) must be euthanized immediately.\nSubscription Required.
