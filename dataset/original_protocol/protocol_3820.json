    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe following steps describe the process of isolating intact nuclei from snap-frozen mouse WAT.\nNote: To minimize contamination with blood cells from the vasculature, it is recommended to do cardiac perfusion with 1× PBS in DEPC-treated water (typically 12 mL per perfusion) prior to isolating the tissue.\nTissue homogenization\nTiming: 30 min\nThe following steps describe how to homogenize adipose tissues using a glass Dounce homogenizer.\nTransfer 400 mg of gonadal adipose tissue (or 100 mg of inguinal adipose tissue) to a pre-cooled Petri dish on ice (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/738-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Adipose tissue homogenization\n(A) Gonadal adipose tissue prior to mincing (step 1).\n(B) Gonadal adipose tissue coarsely minced (step 2).\n(C) Gonadal adipose tissue finely minced (step 2).\n(D) Minced gonadal adipose tissue transferred to a 2 mL Dounce homogenizer (step 3).\n(E) Gonadal adipose tissue Dounce homogenized lightly using only pestle A (step 4).\n(F) Gonadal adipose tissue after Dounce homogenization using both pestle A and B (step 4).\n(G) Gonadal adipose tissue homogenate after filtration (steps 5–9).\nAdd 500 μL of NIB and mince the tissue thoroughly (<1 mm3) using a scalpel (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C).\nCritical: Nuclei yield will be reduced if the tissue is not finely minced.\nWith the scalpel, transfer the minced adipose tissue to a pre-cooled 2 mL glass Dounce homogenizer on ice (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nHomogenize the tissue to release nuclei by applying 5 strokes with pestle A (loose) followed by 5 strokes with pestle B (tight) (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E and 1F).\nCritical: Homogenize carefully to minimize generation of heat and foam, which will impact nuclei intactness.",
    "Note: For adipose tissues from obese mice, use the same amount of tissue as for lean tissues, but homogenize in a total volume of 1 mL NIB and apply 10 strokes with pestle A followed by 5 strokes with pestle B.\nPre-wet a 70 μm cell strainer with DEPC-treated water.\nFilter the homogenate through the pre-wetted cell strainer into a pre-cooled 50 mL tube on ice.\nWash the Dounce homogenizer with 1 mL NIB and filter through the same cell strainer.\nTransfer the filtered homogenate to a pre-cooled 5 mL DNA Low binding tube on ice using a P1000 pipette.\nWash the cell strainer with 1 mL NIB and add to the filtered homogenate in the 5 mL tube to a total volume of ∼2.5 mL using a P1000 pipette (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).\nIsolation of nuclei\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThe following steps describe how to use centrifugation to isolate nuclei from the adipose tissue homogenate.\nCentrifuge the homogenate at 1000×g for 10 min at 4°C using a fixed-angled rotor (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/738-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Isolation of nuclei\n(A) Filtered gonadal adipose tissue homogenate following initial centrifugation using a fixed-angled rotor with a top lipid layer (top arrow). Nuclei are located as a smear along the side of the tube (below bottom arrow) (step 10).\n(B) Adipose tissue homogenate with top lipid layer removed (step 11).\n(C) Resuspension of nuclei in remaining supernatant + additional NIB (steps 12 and 13).\n(D) Nuclei pellet located at the bottom of the tube (arrow) after second centrifugation using a swing-bucket rotor (step 14).\n(E) Nuclei after removal of supernatant, resuspension in NRB and filtration (steps 15–18).\nNote: Nuclei are located as a smear along the side of the 5 mL tube.\nAspirate the lipid layer using a vacuum pump (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).",
    "Critical: Only remove the top lipid layer. Do not remove the entire supernatant, as this will lead to loss of nuclei.\nResuspend the pellet in the remaining supernatant using a P1000 pipette and transfer the resuspended nuclei to a new pre-cooled 5 mL DNA Low binding tube on ice.\nTo make sure that all nuclei are transferred, wash the first 5 mL tube twice with 1 mL NIB and transfer any remaining nuclei to the new 5 mL tube containing the resuspended nuclei using a P1000 pipette (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nPellet the nuclei by centrifuging at 500×g for 10 min at 4°C using a swing-bucket rotor (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nAspirate the supernatant.\nUse vacuum aspiration to remove most of the supernatant (leave 80–100 μL supernatant) and remove remaining supernatant with a P100 pipette.\nCritical: Be careful not to disturb the nuclei pellet.\nResuspend the nuclei pellet in 100 μL NRB by pipetting using a regular P1000 pipette.\nPre-wet a 40 μm tip strainer with NRB.\nFilter the nuclei through the pre-wetted tip strainer using a P1000 pipette into a pre-cooled 1.5 mL DNA Low binding tube on ice (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E) to remove any remaining debris and avoid nuclei aggregation.\nNote: The nuclei concentration will decrease by 30%–40% following filtration.\nProceed to nuclei counting using a Bürker counting chamber and Trypan Blue.\nMix nuclei and Trypan Blue in equal ratio in a separate tube.\nTransfer 10 μL of the nuclei-Trypan Blue solution to the Bürker counting chamber.\nCount at least 3 squares using bright-field microscopy and quantify the nuclei concentration.\n   Nuclei mL  =   ∑ nuclei count in  n  squares   n  ×  10 4  × 2  \nNote: If nuclei are diluted while counting, multiply the equation for calculating the concentration of nuclei with the dilution factor.",
    "Critical: Verify that nuclei are mostly intact and not clumping (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B). Note, that intact nuclei isolated from adipose tissues have a heterogenic morphology.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/738-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Nuclei isolated from epididymal adipose tissue\nNuclei isolated from epididymal adipose tissue and stained with Trypan Blue (A) or DAPI (B). Nuclei are imaged at 20× magnification. Scale bars represent 100 μm.\n10x Genomics single-nucleus RNA sequencing\nTiming: 2–3 days\nThe following steps describe how to partition nuclei into barcoded gel bead droplets using 10× Genomics v3.1 chemistry and library preparation for Illumina sequencing.\nImmediately following nuclei counting, take out 12,000 nuclei and resuspend in NRB in a new pre-cooled 1.5 mL DNA low binding tube on ice to a total volume of 43.2 μL.\nNote: Here, we used 12,000 nuclei as input for 10× Genomics-based snRNA-seq aiming at an initial recovery of 7,000–8,000 nuclei. Following quality control, nuclei recovery will be further reduced, as nuclei with poor quality metrics, e.g., low number of UMIs and transcripts, are excluded. For details concerning quality control steps of the snRNA-seq data, refer to Sárvári et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4].\nLoad nuclei into the 10× Genomics Chromium Controller and run according to the recommendations of the manufacturer (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/index/doc/user-guide-chromium-single-cell-3-reagent-kits-user-guide-v31-chemistry-dual-index[href=https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/index/doc/user-guide-chromium-single-cell-3-reagent-kits-user-guide-v31-chemistry-dual-index]; steps 1 and 2).\nDual-indexed paired-end sequencing libraries are prepared for Illumina sequencing according to the recommendation of the manufacturer (https://support.10×genomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/index/doc/user-guide-chromium-single-cell-3-reagent-kits-user-guide-v31-chemistry-dual-index[href=https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/index/doc/user-guide-chromium-single-cell-3-reagent-kits-user-guide-v31-chemistry-dual-index]; step 3).",
    "Note: For indexing, it is possible to run the sample index PCR step using half sample volumes with a total reaction volume of 50 μL (25 μL Amp Mix to 15 μL sample (post ligation) and 10 μL of individual Dual Index TT Set A). The remaining sample can be stored at −20°C up to at least a month and used for another round of sample index PCR if needed, e.g., for adjusting the total number of PCR cycles prior to sequencing.\nEach library is sequenced using an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer, aiming at a read coverage of 30,000–50,000 read pairs per droplet (250 million reads in total)."
