    "The experiment was approved by the Ethics Committee of Beijing Foreign Studies University and it complied with the guideline for experiments with human subjects. All subjects in this research provided written informed consent.\n1. Stimuli construction\nDesign experimental stimuli based on the specific research questions. As this study is intended to examine foreign language learning using a semi-artificial language, create the experimental sentences by rearranging sentences in the participants' native language in accordance with the grammatical rules of the tested foreign language. Sample experimental sentences are provided in Table 2.\n\tNOTE: As our study was intended to investigate the learning of Japanese grammar by Chinese learners, a semi-artificial language (Chipanese) was generated with the vocabulary of Chinese and the syntax of Japanese. The experimental sentences were adapted from the experimental stimuli used in Liu, Xu, and Wang27.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60773/60773table2c.jpg\nTable 2: Sample experimental sentences used in this study. Sentence (a) is a Chinese sentence and (b) is its Japanese equivalence. Sentence (c) is the experimental stimuli generated by rearranging sentence (a) in accordance with the syntactic structure of (b). This semi-artificial language was first designed by Liu, Xu, and Wang27.\nSelect representative grammatical structures in the tested language. Make sure to include a variety of grammatical structures to maintain the grammatical complexity and diversity of a natural language.\n\tNOTE: Four grammatical structures were tested in our study, including two simple grammatical structures (SOV, SIOV) and two complex ones ([SOV]SV, [OSV]SV). The lexical frequency of nouns and verbs was matched between different types of sentences.\nFor the training phase, design at least 20 sentences for each grammatical structure in the tested language for the grammaticality judgment task. The grammatical and ungrammatical sentences should be counterbalanced and controlled for lexical variables such as lexical frequency and number of strokes.",
    "For the testing phase, design at least 12 sentences for each grammatical structure in the tested language. Make half of the sentences grammatical and the other half ungrammatical. The grammatical and ungrammatical sentences should be counterbalanced and controlled for lexical variables.\nRandomize the sentences and design the experiment.\n\t\nRandomize the sentences before presenting them to the participants in both the training phase and the testing phase. Find the 'Selection' tab on the Property Page in the stimulus presentation software and set the selection method to 'Random'.\nDivide the experiment into blocks with each lasting for no more than 10 min.\n2. Participant recruitment and preparation for the experiment\nRecruit participants who have no reading difficulties and no background in the foreign language that will be tested. Make sure participants have normal or corrected-to-normal vision.\nRandomly assign the participants into two groups (an experimental group and a control group), with each group containing at least 30 members. Ensure the two groups do not differ in years of education or gender ratio.\nInform the participants that they should be free from exhaustion, hunger, illness, or other conditions that make them uncomfortable on the day of the experiment.\nInvite the participants individually or in groups to the laboratory.\n3. Procedure\nTake the participants to the laboratory room and instruct them to sit down at computer workplaces.\nAsk the participants to read and sign the written informed consent forms.\nHave the participants complete emotion induction.\n\t\nGive the participants the pencil-and-paper version of the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) pictorial rating scale28,29. Ask participants to rate their emotion by using pencils to mark the corresponding manikin.",
    "NOTE: The Self-Assessment Manikin scale is a non-verbal assessment tool to measure the three dimensions of emotion (i.e., valence, arousal, and dominance). The scale we administered was a nine-point scale that ranges from one to nine in each of the three dimensions.\nInstruct participants in the experimental group to listen to the positively-valenced music through headphones for 10 min.\n\t\tNOTE: In this study, Good Time was used to induce positive emotion. A pilot study was implemented in a group of 20 participants to test the validity of the music in emotional induction, and results indicated that participants rated their emotion as significantly more positive after the induction, which showed that the music was effective in placing participants in the positive affective state. Participants in the control group were not exposed to any emotionally-loaded materials. Rather, they proceeded directly to the learning task.\nGive participants the pencil-and-paper version of the Self-Assessment Manikin scale28,29 and ask them to rate their emotional states.\nAsk participants to perform the training task.\n\t\nPresent the following written instructions on the computer screens to inform participants that they will learn a language containing the vocabulary in their native language and a new grammar: \"Welcome to our experiment! In this experiment, you will be required to learn a new language that contains Chinese words and a new grammar. When you are ready, press any key to proceed to the experiment.\"",
    "Present the following written instructions on the computer screens to instruct participants to perform the learning task: \"Next, you will see some sentences on the screen. Please observe them carefully and decide whether they are grammatical or not. Press '1' if the sentences are grammatical, and '0' if they are ungrammatical. After each response, you will receive a feedback reply ('CORRECT!' or 'INCORRECT!') and the correct sentence will be presented. Press any key to proceed to the learning task.\"\nHave the participants judge the grammatical acceptability of the sentences on the computer screen with a press of the button ('1' for grammatical and '0' for ungrammatical) and present a reply ('CORRECT!' or 'INCORRECT!') on the screen after each response. Present the correct structures after the replies to reinforce the effect of learning.\nWhen all trials are completed, present the following written instructions on the computer screens to inform participants that the training task is over: \"The learning task is completed!\"\nGive participants the pencil-and-paper version of the Self-Assessment Manikin scale28,29 and ask them to rate their emotional conditions.\nAsk participants to perform the grammaticality judgment task for the testing session.\n\t\nPresent the following written instructions on the computer screens: \"Please continue to answer similar questions. Please decide whether the grammatical structures of the sentences are correct. Press '1' if you think they are correct and press '0' if you think they are incorrect. You will be given seven seconds to respond. If you fail to respond within the time limit, the next question starts automatically. Press any key to start the experiment.\"\nHave participants read the sentences shown on the screen and judge the grammaticality of the sentences with a button press (\"1\" for grammatical and \"0\" for ungrammatical).",
    "When all trials are completed, present the following written instruction on the computer screens to inform participants that the task is over: \"The end. Thank you for your participation!\"\nAsk the participants to fill in a questionnaire about their demographic details. Prepare their payment during the questionnaire.\nProvide the monetary compensation or reward to participants.\n4. Data analysis\nCollect data from the output files from the stimulus presentation software.\nPerform an ANOVA analysis with emotion (positive, control) and sentence type (SOV, SIOV, OSVSV, SOVSV) as the independent variables and the average accuracy of learning as the dependent variable to explore the effect of emotion on accuracy.\nPerform an ANOVA analysis with emotion (positive, control) and sentence type (SOV, SIOV, OSVSV, SOVSV) as the independent variables and the average RTs as the dependent variable to explore the effect of emotion on RTs.\nSubscription Required.
