    "All animal studies were approved by the University of Maryland and the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. C57BL/6 female mice, 6-8 weeks of age, were used for the present study. The mice were obtained from commercial sources (see Table of Materials). All Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) regulations were followed, including the usage of masks, gloves, and gowns.\n1. Initial intracranial tumor implantation\nAt the initial phase of the study, intracranially inject each mouse with 100,000 cells (GL261 murine glioma cell line) suspended in 4 µL of phosphate-buffered saline (1x PBS) to a depth of 2.5 mm following the previously published report7.\nQuantify the tumor signal in each mouse using the in vivo imaging system8 9 days following tumor implantation.\n\tNOTE: If needed, stratify the mice into two groups based on tumor burden. In the present study, the two groups were: (1) mice with relatively small tumor burden (mean bioluminescent signal = 5.5e+006 ± 0.1e+006 photons/s, n = 10) and (2) mice with relatively large tumor burden (mean bioluminescent signal = 1.69e+007 ± 0.2e+007 photons/s, n = 10), (p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney test)9.\nDivide each group into two comparable subgroups.\n\tNOTE: In this study, the two subgroups were: untreated mice (n = 5) and mice with tumors undergoing surgical resection using the MIRS (n = 5), (p > 0.05, Mann-Whitney test)9.\nStarting from the day of the resection, track the tumor progression using the in vivo imaging system at a frequency based on the tumor growth pattern.\n\tNOTE: For the GL261 cell line, track the tumor progression on the day of the resection and then every 3-6 days.\n2. Tumor resection using MIRS\nAnesthetize the mouse using an isoflurane-O2 gas mixture in an induction chamber or intraperitoneal injection of xylazine/ketamine solution.",
    "If using the gas anesthetic, set the gas flow rate to 1.0 mL/min and the vaporizer to 2.0% for anesthesia induction, typically requiring 3-5 min in the chamber (see Table of Materials).\nIf using the injectable anesthetic, anesthetize the mice by injecting 0.2 mL of anesthetic solution (80-100 mg/kg of ketamine and 10-12.5 mg/kg of xylazine, see Table of Materials) intraperitoneally.\nAssess the animal for adequate sedation by pinching the toe. Apply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes to avoid dryness of the cornea. Administer an analgesic (0.03-0.06 mg/kg buprenorphine subcutaneously) prior to the procedure.\nPlace the mouse onto the stereotactic frame (see Table of Materials) once full sedation has been confirmed.\n\tNOTE: If using the gas anesthetic, place the nose of the mouse in a nose cone where it will continue to receive the isoflurane-O2 mixture during the procedure (1.5%).\nRemove the previous staple, then remove the hair either with a depilatory cream or by shaving. Disinfect the skin with alternating cycles of a chlorhexidine/betadine-based scrub and alcohol. Then, using a sterile scalpel, create a 1 cm longitudinal midline incision along the previous surgical scar.\nAttach the MIRS handpiece to the stereotactic arm through the stage adapter/handpiece holder for enhanced stability and precision.\nSet up the MIRS machine (see Table of Materials) using the following settings (Figure 1).\n\t\nInsert the power cord set on the rear panel into the power cord receptacle. Turn the power to the system on or off by toggling (1 = ON, 0 = OFF).\nInsert one end of the nitrogen hose (supplied with the console) into the male fitting on the console's rear panel. Rotate the connection nut clockwise to tighten the connection.\n\t\tNOTE: The opposite end of the hose needs to be connected to the nitrogen supply.",
    "Before attaching the hose to the nitrogen supply, confirm that the supply pressure does not exceed 100 psig, which is the input supply pressure recommended for the console.\n\t\tNOTE: The console will generate its own aspiration when activated by the foot pedal once the nitrogen has been supplied to the console.\nSecure the lid of the vacuum port and seal it to avoid any leakage in the vacuum system. Any leaks in the aspiration system will affect the performance of the MIRS console.\nIf the aspiration is below 17 during setup or priming, check that the aspiration knob on the front of the console is set at the maximum level (100), ensure there is no leakage in the aspiration system, and confirm that the nitrogen input supply pressure is correct.\nTo connect the foot pedal to the console, insert the gray foot pedal connector into its gray receptacle until it clicks and fits into position.\n\t\tNOTE: The foot pedal connector connects to the console in one orientation, and it is keyed.\nTo connect the handpiece to the console, insert the blue handpiece connector into its blue receptacle until it clicks and fits into position.\n\t\tNOTE: The handpiece connector connects to the console in one orientation, and it is keyed.\nPrime each handpiece before using the system by aspirating sterile fluid from a small bowl into the aperture, through the tubing and handpiece, and then into the canister to ensure that the inside of the tubing and handpiece are lubricated to reduce the tissue occlusions.\nPrepare for aspiration alone or aspiration with cutting by selecting the appropriate mode on the console's front panel. Initiate using the foot pedal.\nInsert the 23 G MIRS cannula into the burr hole to a depth of 2.5 mm.",
    "Initiate the resection process by depressing the foot pedal connected to the cannula. Perform one full cycle (360°) or more of resection using the control knob in the handpiece.\n\tNOTE: The more cycles performed, the more volume of tumor tissue resected.\nOnce the resection process is complete, withdraw the 23 G MIRS cannula from the burr hole and use 5 mL of 1x PBS to flush the tubing and dislodge any residual debris.\nRemove the mouse from the stereotactic frame and close the wound with a stapler or 4-0 suturing material (see Table of Materials).\nPlace the mouse on a heating pad or under a warming light during recovery from anesthesia before returning it to its cage.\nAfter the experiment is complete, purge the cannula via flushing. Alternate with chilled media and air to \"push\" all of the resected tissue back to the collection canister. Remove the collection canister from the system and cap off with the provided cap.\nAfter completing step 2.12, place the distal tip of the cannula into 3% H2O2 and apply suction at 24-25 in Hg to fill the suction line back to the suction collection canister and let stand for 60-90 s. Flush with sterile media pulsing air and media intermittently.\nMonitor the mice for any neurological signs (abnormal erratic movements or seizures) following the procedure.\nEuthanize the mice with severe neurological impairments (become lethargic, have a gaunt appearance, hunched back, or have erratic movements).\n\tNOTE: For the present study, 200 mg/kg of a commercially available euthanasia solution (see Table of Materials) was used to euthanize each mouse.\n3. Tissue collection via  TPS\nImmerse the tumor sample in a tissue culture dish containing an RBC lysis medium (see Table of Materials) for 5 min at room temperature.",
    "NOTE: The tissue harvested from the MIRS into the TPS will be primarily in the form of single cells along with small chunks of tissue.\nPlace a 70 µm filter (see Table of Materials) on a 50 mL conical tube and use a plunger of a 5 mL syringe to pass the tumor sample through the filter.\nWith a transfer pipette, use the RPMI-1640 media to facilitate the passing of cells and any tissue mass through the filter.\nCentrifuge at 428 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant by a pipette.\nResuspend each sample in 5 mL of prepared RPMI-1640 medium.\nTo increase tissue viability, especially if large tissue chunks are visualized on initial impression, add the required volumes of the enzyme cocktail (containing DNAse I, collagenase IV, dispase, Papain, and EDTA, see Table of Materials) to each sample. Use the vortex to mix the solutions.\n\tNOTE: Step 3.6 is optional. The composition of the enzyme cocktail (for a total volume of 5 mL/sample): 300 µL of DNAse I Grade II, 150 µL of Collagenase/Dispase (cleaves fibronectin, collagenase IV, I, and nonpolar amino acids), 250 µL of Papain (nonspecific protease), and 6 µL of 0.5 M EDTA.\nPlace the samples in a shaker incubator set at 200 rpm, 37 °C for 20 min.\nAfter 20 min, spin the samples at 428 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant.\nFilter single cells through a 70 µm cell strainer and spin down at 274 x g for 3 min at 4 °C. Conduct cell viability analysis10 with Trypan Blue and Hemocytometer (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Day 0 viability ranges from 30%-70% and increases significantly within 2-3 days.\nProceed to Steps 4, 5, or 6, depending on the viability test needed.",
    "4. Growing cells in adherent culture\nIn a certified laminar flow hood, resuspend the pellet in serum-containing adherent medium (such as DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) solution) and plate cells in an adherent cell flask.\nMaintain the cells in a controlled incubated environment (37 °C, 5% CO2).\n5. Growing cells in suspension culture (neurospheres)\nIn a certified laminar flow hood, resuspend the pellet in serum-free complete stem cell medium11 and plate in a suspension flask.\nMaintain the cells in a controlled incubated environment (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 2-3 days to allow neurosphere formation.\nAfter visualization of the neurospheres in the culture medium, use Trypsin-EDTA or Accutase (see Table of Materials) to obtain single-cell suspensions for passaging.\n\tNOTE: As long as special care is taken during harvest and appropriate media supporting neural stem cells is used, the stem cells in the harvested tissue must form neurospheres within a few days.\n6. Preparing cells for reimplantation\nResuspend the pellet at a concentration of 100,000 live cells per 4 µL of 1x PBS.\nImmediately inject into naïve mice using the intracranial tumor implantation method (step 1).\n7. Histological analysis\nImmediately following resection, extract and fix the brains in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 24 h12.\nTransfer the brains to a 30% sucrose solution until they are saturated with sucrose (sunken down to the bottom of the container).\nTransfer the brains to a 70% ethanol solution.\nPerform paraffin block embedding, sectioning, and standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining following previously published report13.\n\tNOTE: The thickness of each section taken for staining was 10 µm.\nSubscription Required.
