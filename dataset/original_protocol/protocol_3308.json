At the end of the section,\n      each well will contain one of the 384 uniquely barcoded i7 primers (well\n      indexes) and each plate will contain a different plate-specific barcoded\n      i5 primer (plate index). i7 and i5 primers amplify and fully barcode\n      tagmented fragments of open chromatin (scATAC-seq fragments).\n    \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3075-Fig7.jpg\n          Figure 7. The automated preparation of barcoded lysis buffer\n        \n          Liquid handling platforms used at individual steps, as well as volumes\n          transferred, are indicated next to the arrows.

Bottom right: setup for volume transfer between plates.\n          Note that this instrument has 3 plate holders, but an instrument with\n          2 plate holders can also be used.\n        \nCritical: Decide in advance how many\n      plates will be sequenced on the same sequencing run (or in the same lane),\n      to estimate the required number of different i5 indexes. Refer to the note\n      after part 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4], point 60, for considerations about the",
    "required sequencing depth per cell for scATAC-seq libraries.\n    \nOptional: Here, we describe the\n      procedure for generating five lysis buffer 384-well plates, but more\n      plates can be prepared at the same time for convenience and stored at\n      −80°C for at least 2 months.\n    \nNote: 384-well or 96-well plates can be\n      used. Here, we describe the procedure for 384-well plates. If 96-well\n      plates are used instead, we recommend doubling all the volumes.\n    \nNote: Part 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1] should\n      be performed in a designated pre-PCR clean area, ideally in a biosafety\n      cabinet, to avoid contaminations from PCR products.\n    \nNote: In the following steps, we describe\n      the usage of the MANTIS and of the INTEGRA VIAFLO 96/384 electronic\n      pipettor in detail. These liquid handling platforms will also be used\n      throughout the later stages, but for detailed instructions about their\n      setup and usage please refer to these initial steps. We advise getting\n      familiar with the working procedures of these platforms in advance (Figures 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]\n      and 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9] and Methods videos S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc8],\n      S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc9], S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc10], and\n      S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc11]). Note that the use of these platforms is not\n      essential, but drastically increases throughput. Finally, note that\n      alternative equivalent liquid handling platforms can be used.\n    \n        Prepare 50 mL of 1.1× lysis buffer as outlined in the table below:\n        table:files/protocols_protocol_3075_15.csv\nMix well using a serological pipette. Keep the buffer cold.\n        Dispense 27 μL of 1.1× lysis buffer into each well of a fresh 384-well\n        plate.\n        \nNote: Here, we describe the procedure\n          using the MANTIS liquid handling platform (alternative platforms can\n          be used).\n        \n            Switch on the MANTIS.\n            \n                Clean the MANTIS plate holder and chip holder with 70% ethanol.\n              \nOpen the MANTIS software.\n                Insert a High Volume (HV) chip into the chip holder (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc8]).\n              \n            Perform manual priming of the chip:\n            \nInsert a 1 mL non-filtered tip into the chip.",
    "Pipette 500 μL of nuclease-free water into the tip (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A).\n              \n                Make sure “HV” is selected next to the “Reagent Name” column (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B).\n              \n                Click on the chip position number: this indicates to the MANTIS\n                arm to grab the chip at the indicated position (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B).\n              \n                Click on the “Manual Priming Input on MANTIS Arms” icon (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B) and wait until all water passes through the chip.

Make sure the plate sits well\n            inside the rack.\n            \nInsert a new non-filtered 1 mL tip into the chip.\n                Pipette ∼1500 μL into the tip. Ensure that there are no bubbles\n                at the bottom of the tip.\n              \n                Click the green start icon (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]C) to\n                start dispensing (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc8]).\n                Depending on the “Tip volume” you set, the dispense will pause",
    "after a given time and allow you to refill the tip with 1.1×\n                lysis buffer.\n              \n            Once the dispense is done, remove the plate rack from the MANTIS,\n            cover the plate with an aluminum or plastic adhesive seal, and\n            centrifuge in a plate spinner for 10 s at 500 × g. You can\n            leave the plate at 21°C.\n          \n            Replace the 1 mL tip on the chip with an empty clean tip for\n            washing.\n            \nClick the chip position number to grab the chip.\n                Click the “Wash Input on MANTIS Arms” icon (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]E) – this will flush the chip with 500 μL of 70% ethanol and\n                500 μL of water.\n              \n                When done, click the “Recover Input on MANTIS Arms” icon (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]E) 1–2 times to aspirate any remaining volume from the chip.\n              \nClick on the chip position again to release the chip.\n                Remove the tip.\n                \nNote: We perform the water\n                  priming step (point 2b) each time we start using the MANTIS.\n                  Hereafter, we refer to this step as ‘manual priming with\n                  water’.\n                \nNote: We recommend using one\n                  MANTIS HV chip exclusively for lysis buffer preparation steps.\n                \nCritical: Set a high\n                  enough “Pre-dispense” volume (at least 15 μL) to get air\n                  bubbles outside of the chip prior to dispensing. This avoids\n                  insufficient volume being dispensed inside the first wells.\n                  Hence, whenever using the MANTIS, prepare at least ∼15% of\n                  dead volume of the dispensed mix.\n                \nCritical: Make sure to\n                  have enough 70% ethanol and nuclease-free water in the washing\n                  tubes to properly flush the chip. Always use nuclease-free\n                  water.\n                \n        Transfer 3 μL of the 100 μM barcoded i7 indexes to the 1.1× lysis buffer\n        plate, to obtain a stock plate of 10 μM barcoded i7 indexes in 1× lysis\n        buffer.\n        \nNote: We perform this step using the",
    "INTEGRA VIAFLO electronic pipettor with a 384-well 12.5 μL pipetting\n          head (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]), but this step can be performed\n          with any multichannel pipette system.\n        \n            Switch on the VIAFLO. When prompted, press the RUN key to home the\n            instrument, and when prompted press the RUN key again to home the\n            pipettor.\n          \n            Make sure the 384-well pipetting head is installed. If you need to\n            switch heads:\n            \n                Scroll to “Toolbox” on the display with the touch wheel, select\n                it with the OK key, and select “Change Head” with the OK key.\n              \n                Follow the instructions on the display (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc9]).\n              \n            Select “Pipet” from the display. Set the pipetting volume to 3 μL,\n            Aspirate Speed to 4, and Dispense Speed to 1.\n          \n            Load the tips (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc10]):\n            \n                Make sure the stage lever is set to the central position (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]).\n              \nPlace a new 384 tip box in the plate holder position B.\n                By holding the controller, lower the pipetting unit towards the\n                tips until the tip loading button starts flashing.\n              \n                Push the tip loading button while keeping the pipetting unit\n                down. When the tip loading button stops flashing, pull up the\n                pipetting unit. Tips should now be fully loaded on the head.\n              \n            Place the 100 μM barcoded i7 index plate and the 1.1× lysis buffer\n            plate in two adjacent plate holders (positions A and AB,\n            respectively).\n          \n            Insert the tips close to the bottom of the 100 μM barcoded i7 index\n            plate and aspirate 3 μL by pressing the RUN key on the controller.\n            \n                Move the pipetting unit up and insert the tips into the 1.1×\n                lysis buffer plate.\n              \n                Press the RUN key again to release the volume and wait until the\n                display signals “Done”. This will generate a 10 μM barcoded i7",
    "index plate at a total volume of 30 μL per well (Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc11]).\n              \n                Change the pipetting volume to 12 μL on the display while the\n                tips are still inserted in the plate.\n              \n                Aspirate and dispense using the RUN key 3–5 times to properly\n                mix the i7 indexes with the lysis buffer (Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc11]).\n              \n            Once mixing is complete:\n            \n                Remove the 100 μM barcoded i7 index plate from the holder, cover\n                well with two aluminum adhesive seals, and place on dry ice for\n                snap freezing.\n              \n                Remove the stock 10 μM i7 index plate, cover with an aluminum or\n                plastic adhesive seal, and centrifuge in a plate spinner for\n                20 s at 500 × g.\n              \n                Label the plate as “i7 10 μM stock” and let it rest for 10 min\n                at 21°C.\n              \nPlace the plate in the fridge or on a cold rack.\n            Finally, remove the tips from the pipetting head: place the empty\n            384 tip box on a plate holder position B, insert the tips into the\n            box (do not touch the bottom of the box), and press the tip ejection\n            key twice (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc10]). Dispose of the\n            tips.\n            \nCritical: Take absolute care\n              to avoid any cross-well contamination of i7 indexes at this point,\n              especially when handling the 100 μM barcoded i7 index plate.\n            \nNote: When dispensing the 384\n              barcodes, visually inspect the volume in the tips to make sure all\n              the barcodes were aspirated.\n            \nNote: When using the VIAFLO to\n              transfer or mix viscous solutions (as the 1.1× lysis buffer), keep\n              the Dispense Speed low, to avoid retention of the volume inside\n              the tips.\n            \n        Dilute the 100 μM i5 plate barcodes in 1.1× lysis buffer:\n        \n            Mix 50 μL of 100 μM i5 plate barcode with 450 μL of 1.1× lysis",
    "buffer, to obtain a 10 μM i5 plate barcode/1× lysis buffer mix.\n          \nMix well and keep cold.\nRepeat for all i5 barcodes.\nCritical: Avoid any\n      cross-contamination of different i5 barcodes. Clean the pipettes between\n      dispenses with 70% ethanol, to avoid traces of the previous i5 barcode\n      contaminating the next one. Also, make sure to use filtered tips! If you\n      notice cross-contamination, do not use these barcodes!\n    \nNote: The number of different 10 μM i5\n      mixes depends on the number of 384-well plates that will be multiplexed on\n      the same sequencing run. We usually multiplex 5 plates on the same\n      sequencing run; hence, we prepare 5 different 10 μM i5 plate barcode\n      mixes.\n    \nNote: The volumes here are sufficient to\n      prepare one 384-well plate per i5 barcode. If you are preparing more\n      384-well plates with the same i5 barcode, prepare more 10 μM i5 plate\n      barcode/1× lysis buffer mix accordingly.\n    \n        Transfer 1 μL of the 10 μM barcoded i7 indexes from the i7 10 μM stock\n        plate into fresh 384-well plates. Prepare five fresh 384-well plates.\n        \nNote: Here, we describe the procedure\n          using the VIAFLO in Repeat Dispense pipetting mode.\n        \n            Load a new set of 384 tips (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc10]).\n          \n            Place the i7 10 μM stock plate and the first fresh 384-well plate on\n            two plate holders of the VIAFLO. Keep the stage lever at the central\n            position.\n          \n            In the display, select “Repeat Dispense”. Set “Dispense” to 1 μL;\n            “Count” to 6; “Aspiration Speed” to 1; “Dispense Speed” to 1.\n          \nAspirate 6 μL from the i7 10 μM stock plate.\n            Transfer 1 μL into the fresh 384-well plate (insert the tips close\n            to the well bottom).\n          \n            Remove the aliquoted plate from the holder and cover with a plastic\n            or aluminum adhesive seal.",
    "Repeat points 5e and 5f for the remaining fresh 384-well plates.\n          \n            Dispense the remaining volume into the i7 10 μM stock plate with the\n            PURGE key.\n          \nRemove the tips (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc10]).\n            Centrifuge all the plates in a plate spinner for 10 s at\n            500 × g. Snap freeze the i7 10 μM stock plate on dry ice.\n            Place the five aliquoted 384-well plates in the fridge. Switch off\n            the VIAFLO.\n            \nCritical: When aliquoting\n              small volumes into empty plates as described here, make sure that\n              the tips are in close proximity of the well bottom. Otherwise, the\n              liquid may be retained on the tips.\n            \nCritical: After all plates are\n              dispensed, visually inspect the bottom of each plate to make sure\n              that each well contains the i7 index. Sometimes, a few wells are\n              not dispensed due to liquid retention on the tip. If this happens,\n              manually transfer 1 μL from the i7 10 μM stock plate to the\n              missing wells.\n            \n        Finally, aliquot 1 μL of 10 μM i5 index (point 4) into the five plates\n        containing 1 μL of 10 μM i7 indexes (point 5), to obtain 2 μL of fully\n        barcoded lysis buffer per well. A different 10 μM i5 index will be\n        aliquoted into each plate.\n        \nNote: Here, we describe the procedure\n          using the MANTIS.\n        \n            Create a new Dispense List to aliquot 1 μL of into each well.

However,\n      note that this may result in lower scATAC-seq library complexity and\n      higher percentage of mitochondrial reads.\n    \nCritical: Considerable nuclei loss can\n      occur at this step. The nuclei pellet is usually harder to see than a\n      cellular pellet and, sometimes, a spread of nuclei can be observed instead\n      of a round pellet. If pellets start falling toward the bottom of the tube,\n      leave a few μL on the bottom. However, do not leave excessive liquid in\n      the tube – this causes Tn5 dilution and retention of mitochondrial DNA.\n    \nNote: When working with many samples,\n      pellets drop slowly toward the bottom of the tube. This is usually not a\n      point of concern if you can still see them, but make sure not to aspirate\n      pellets.\n    \n        Resuspend nuclei in 50 μL of Tn5-tagmentation mix and pipette mix gently\n        ∼20 times.

A “wavy” shape is expected, with variable\n        peak heights.\n        \n            If you observe excessive traces of primers or primer dimers, perform\n            an additional AMPure XP bead purification using 1.2× bead:sample\n            ratio.\n          \n            If a large high-bp peak (details in Figure 18[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig18])\n            is present, repeat the AMPure XP double-side exclusion (points\n            46–55).\n          \nNote: If running many pools, we recommend\n      using either the Agilent 4200 TapeStation System with a High Sensitivity\n      D5000 Kit in 96-well plate format, or the Agilent Fragment Analyzer HS NGS\n      Fragment Analysis Kit (1–6000 bp).\n    \n        Once you obtain the concentration [ng/μL] and the average size for each\n        pool, combine equimolar ratios of each pool that will be sequenced on\n        the same run into a fresh DNA LoBind 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube (or\n        equivalent). Use\n        Table S4[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3075-Mmc4.xlsx]\n        as pooling template.\n      \n        Quantify the final pool using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit and estimate\n        its average size with Agilent Bioanalyzer or TapeStation.\n        \n            Input the results into appropriate columns in\n            Table S4[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3075-Mmc4.xlsx]\n            to estimate library molarity.\n          \n            Dilute the library to 4 nM for sequencing on Illumina platforms.\n          \nCritical: Be precise when diluting the\n      final library for sequencing. Excessive library will result in flow cell\n      over-clustering, which might cause the sequencing run to fail. If the\n      library is too diluted, under-clustering will result in low data amount,",
    "and excessive under-clustering may lead to a failed run.\n    \nSequence the libraries on an Illumina platform.\nNote: The choice of platform and kit\n      depends on the desired sequencing depth. We usually aim for 200,000\n      reads/cell, and thus sequence 5 pooled 384-well plates on an Illumina\n      NextSeq platform, using a High Output kit. If more plates are sequenced\n      together, a HiSeq or a NovaSeq platform might be more suitable. We usually\n      perform 75 bp paired-end sequencing (150 cycles), but it is also possible\n      to sequence using fewer cycles. Classic Illumina primers from the kits are\n      used for sequencing.\n    \nNote: Different samples and tissues\n      display variable library complexity. While 200,000 reads/cell might be\n      suitable for some tissue types, this may be either excessive or\n      insufficient for others. PCR duplication values are usually a good metric\n      of whether you sequenced the libraries to saturation.\n    \nPart 5: Single-cell genotyping library preparation\nTiming: 2 days for 5–20 genotyping\n      plates; 3 days for 20–40 genotyping plates\n    \n      In this section, we describe the procedures for generating\n      Illumina-compatible libraries for single-cell genotyping, starting from\n      the genotyping stock plates prepared in part 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3],\n      point 38. For each cell, non-barcoded genotyping amplicons were generated\n      in part 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3], point 36 by target-specific genotyping\n      primers. Now, genotyping amplicons need to be further enriched and fully\n      barcoded, to be able to assign them to single cells. This is achieved via\n      two additional PCR steps (Figure 13[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig13]).\n    \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3075-Fig13.jpg\n          Figure 13. Single-cell genotyping procedures\n        \n          Liquid handling platforms used at individual steps, as well as volumes\n          transferred, are indicated next to the arrows. A schematic overview of\n          the amplification and barcoding strategy at each step is shown below.\n        \n      The first step (genotyping PCR1) uses primers that are nested within the\n      original amplicon(s) and which contain universal CS1 (forward primer) and",
    "CS2 (reverse primer) adapters. Plate-specific 6 bp barcode sequences are\n      incorporated into these primers, between the CS adaptors and the\n      target-specific sequence, enabling libraries from different plates to be\n      pooled together later. The second step (genotyping PCR2) uses primers that\n      bind to the CS1/CS2 adapters (from the Access Array Barcode Library for\n      Illumina Sequencers-384, Single Direction kit) and that attach\n      Illumina-compatible sequencing adapters to genotyping amplicons. The\n      primer that binds to the CS2 adapter also contains a 10 bp index, serving\n      as cell barcode, which is well-specific. The combination of plate and cell\n      barcode is unique for each cell across all plates, allowing all amplicons\n      to be sequenced together. After genotyping PCR2, libraries are pooled,\n      purified, and quantified for sequencing.\n    \nNote: The steps described in\n      part 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.5] are performed using the MANTIS, INTEGRA\n      VIAFLO, and the Mosquito HTS Nanolitre Liquid Handler (Figure 13[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig13]). However, users might automate the protocol on other liquid handling\n      platforms, such as the Biomek FxP Liquid Handling Platform (Beckman\n      Coulter).6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\n        Order barcoded genotyping PCR1 primers, validated in\n        preparation two[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3] and\n        preparation three[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.4] (nested genotyping primers), for\n        each genotyping locus of interest. Examples on how to design barcoded\n        genotyping PCR1 primers6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] are provided in\n        Table S5[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3075-Mmc5.xlsx].\n        \n            Reconstitute barcoded genotyping PCR1 primers at 100 μM in TE\n            buffer, in a designated pre-PCR clean area, ideally in a biosafety\n            cabinet.\n          \n            Keep reconstituted primers at −20°C prior to use or proceed directly\n            with point 62.\n          \nNote: The plate barcode is defined by the\n      unique combination of the forward and the reverse 6 bp barcodes on the\n      genotyping PCR1 primers. The number of different barcoded combinations of\n      genotyping PCR1 primer pairs to order for each locus depends on the number\n      of genotyping stock plates that you have. For example, if you sorted the",
    "sample into 10 plates, you need 10 different barcoded genotyping PCR1\n      primer pairs for each genotyping locus. For details, refer to\n      Table S5[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3075-Mmc5.xlsx].\n    \nCritical: When ordering barcoded\n      genotyping PCR1 primers, name each primer according to the locus and\n      barcode, to avoid confusion. We also advise labelling the tube caps.\n    \n        Prepare 770 μL of each genotyping PCR1 primer mix: add 8.58 μL of each\n        100 μM genotyping PCR1 primer to the respective mix and top up with\n        nuclease-free water to 770 μL. A template for genotyping PCR1 primer mix\n        preparation can be found in\n        Table S6[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3075-Mmc6.xlsx].\n        \nNote: At this point, the final\n          concentration of each primer in the primer mix should be 1.11 μM.\n        \nNote: The total number of primer mixes\n          depends on (a) the number of genotyping stock plates, and (b) the\n          number of genotyped loci per cell. Each genotyping stock plate\n          requires a different primer mix, due to different plate barcodes.\n          Furthermore, in preparation three[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.4], point 21, you\n          defined how many different genotyping reactions are required per\n          single cell, which depends on the number of targeted loci. Usually, up\n          to 4 different genotyping amplicons per cell can be combined in the\n          same reaction. To provide examples:\n        \n            If you have 5 genotyping plates and amplify 1 locus/cell, prepare 5\n            primer mixes;\n          \n            if you have 5 genotyping plates and amplify 4 loci/cell, prepare 5\n            primer mixes;\n          \n            if you have 5 genotyping plates and amplify 6 loci/cell, prepare 10\n            primer mixes;\n          \n            if you have 10 genotyping plates and amplify 8 loci/cell, prepare 20\n            primer mixes.\n          \nNote: All primers used to amplify\n          targets from a single initial genotyping stock plate need to have the\n          same plate barcode, even if they are not all in the same genotyping\n          PCR1 reaction (given that they barcode the same “original” plate).

    "Switch on the Mosquito and set up a program as in\n            Figure 14[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig14]B: this will pool an entire PCR2 plate\n            into column 1 of the PCR2 pooling plate, taking 1 μL from each well\n            of genotyping PCR2 plate.\n          \n            Insert one genotyping PCR2 plate and the PCR2 pooling plate into\n            magnetic racks for the Mosquito (Figure 14[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig14]C).\n          \n            Place the genotyping PCR2 plate at position 1 and the PCR2 pooling\n            plate at position 2 of the Mosquito (Figure 14[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig14]C).\n          \nRun the program.\n            When the program is done, cover the genotyping PCR2 plate with an\n            aluminum adhesive seal and snap freeze.\n          \n            Repeat points 69d–69g for the second genotyping PCR2 plate, this\n            time pooling into column 3 of the PCR2 pooling plate (Figure 14[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig14]A). The third genotyping PCR2 plate will be pooled into column 5,\n            etc.\n            \nNote: Given that you pool into\n              every second column of the PCR2 pooling plate, you can pool up to\n              12 genotyping PCR2 plates into one pooling plate.\n            \nNote: Switch Mosquito tips between\n              each genotyping PCR2 plate to maintain pipetting accuracy.\n            \nOptional: Genotyping PCR2\n              plate pooling can also be performed with a multichannel pipette or\n              with an alternative liquid handling platform.\n            \n        When the PCR2 pooling plate is ready, pool all the wells of a single\n        column into a fresh DNA LoBind 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube (or\n        equivalent), labeled according to the genotyping PCR2 plate, using a\n        P200. The total number of tubes equals the number of genotyping PCR2\n        plates.\n      \nOptional: If you have many columns to\n      pool, we suggest using a 12 × 200 μL multichannel pipette and transferring\n      the material into a V-bottom 96-well plate. Keep track of which pool is in\n      which well.\n    \n        Prepare for bead purification of the pools using V-bottom 96-well\n        plates:\n        \n            Incubate AMPure XP beads for 30 min at 21°C. After 30 min, vortex",
    "thoroughly and pour into a clean reservoir, labeled “beads”.\n          \n            Prepare 80% (vol/vol) ethanol by mixing 40 mL of ethanol 100% and\n            10 mL of nuclease-free water. Pour 80% ethanol into a clean\n            reservoir, labeled “EtOH”.\n          \n            Pour nuclease-free water into a second clean reservoir, labeled\n            “H2O”.\n          \n            Transfer 100 μL of each pool to a well of a fresh V-bottom 96-well\n            plate.\n          \nOptional: You can also bead-purify in\n      microcentrifuge tubes or in PCR strips, but for higher numbers of\n      libraries, using an 8 × 200 μL multichannel pipette and the V-shaped\n      96-well plates is more practical.\n    \n        Add 120 μL of beads (1.2× beads:sample ratio) to each pool and mix 20–30\n        times. Avoid bubbles.\n        \n            Incubate at 21°C for at least 5 min – this will allow DNA fragments\n            of interest to bind to the beads.\n          \n        Place the plate on a magnetic stand for plates. Beads will accumulate\n        towards the magnet. Wait for the liquid to become completely clear of\n        beads (minimum 3 min).\n      \n        When the supernatant is completely clear, carefully remove and discard\n        all supernatant (∼220 μL), taking care not to aspirate the beads.\n      \n        Proceed immediately with 80% ethanol washing:\n        \n            Dropwise, add 200 μL of 80% ethanol to each pool, not disturbing the\n            beads.\n          \nIncubate for 30 s.\nRemove and discard all 80% ethanol, not disturbing the beads.\nRepeat points 75a–75c 1–2 more times.\n            After the final wash, carefully remove traces of ethanol using 20 μL\n            tips.\n          \n        Let the beads air-dry for a few minutes (usually 4–5 min at this step).\n        The beads are dry enough when the surface of the pellet changes from\n        shiny to matt.\n      \n        Remove the plate from the magnet. Resuspend beads in 50 μL of\n        nuclease-free water. Mix thoroughly 20–30 times to completely resuspend\n        the beads and incubate at 21°C for 3 min.",
    "Place the plate back on the magnet and wait for 2–3 min for the\n        supernatant to be completely devoid of beads. Libraries are now in the\n        supernatant.\n      \n        Transfer 48–50 μL of clear supernatant to fresh DNA LoBind 1.5 mL\n        microcentrifuge tubes (or equivalent), labeled accordingly. Take care\n        not to transfer any beads.\n      \n        Measure the concentration of each pool using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay\n        Kit. Use 1 μL of each library. Take note of the pool concentration\n        [ng/μL].\n      \n        For each pool, check genotyping library size distribution using a\n        microcapillary assay such as Agilent Bioanalyzer or TapeStation with a\n        D1000 Kit. Check that each pool contains peaks at the expected size and\n        record the average library size by choosing the region between 50 and\n        900 bp. Representative good quality libraries can be found in\n        Figure 15[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig15].\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3075-Fig15.jpg\n              Figure 15.

When pooling, consider the average library\n        size, the concentration [ng/μL], and the number of amplicons per pool.\n        Use\n        Table S7[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3075-Mmc7.xlsx]\n        as template.\n      \nOptional: At this stage, you may\n      perform a double-size AMPure XP bead selection on the final pool, by using\n      a 0.6×, followed by a 1.2× beads:sample ratio. This step can help remove",
    "or reduce the high-bp peak which is likely a trace of the scATAC-seq\n      library. However, do not perform this step if you expect a genotyping\n      amplicon to be of that size!\n    \n        Measure the concentration [ng/μL] of the final pool with Qubit and the\n        average library size with Agilent TapeStation D1000.\n        \n            Dilute the library to 4 nM for sequencing (Table S7[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3075-Mmc7.xlsx]).\n          \n        Sequence the library on either a MiSeq platform, using custom sequencing\n        CS1 (read 1), CS2 (read 2), and CS2rc (index read) primers, or on a\n        NextSeq platform, using custom sequencing LCS1 (read 1), CS2 (read 2),\n        and CS2rc (index read) primers (Figure 16[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig16]).\n        Single-use primer aliquots were prepared in\n        preparation four[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.5].\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3075-Fig16.jpg\n              Figure 16.
