    "Prepare 100x Planarians Artificial Medium (PAM) stock solution (see Recipe 1).Note: Separated stocks of 100x PAM water and 100x CaCl2•2H2O solution should be prepared to avoid salt precipitation. It is not recommended to prepare a higher concentrated stock because salts may precipitate. Dilute the appropriate amount of both solutions and mix them just before their use (see Recipes). Do not store the diluted stocks in the water tanks for more than 1 week. Prepare 100x CaCl2 Stock solution (see Recipe 2).When required, dilute the stocks to 1x in Millipore water using the water tanks. For 10 L of 1x PAM water use 100 ml of each stock.Put planarians, obtained from a clonal line strain of Schmidtea mediterranea in a glass Tupperware and fill it with 1x PAM water up to ¾ of the Tupperware capacity (Figure 1B). Keep planarians in a \"Planarium\": a separated room or incubator with controlled temperature (around 20 °C) and maintained in the dark.Note: To increase the population, planarians can be cut at postpharyngeal level, which is the region that fissions during natural asexual reproduction. The fragments will completely regenerate the missing parts in two weeks. If planarians are big (> 0.5 cm) and a high increase in the population is desired, an additional cut can be performed prepharyngeally. To promote planarians grow and reproduction, feed them 2 or 3 times a week with organic beef liver. To do that, immerse small pieces of liver in the water during 5-7 h (a piece of 4 cm2 cut in smaller fragments can be added in a 150 cm2 Tupperware). After this time, remove the liver and change with the PAM water. When mucus is observed in the Tupperware walls, clean it with a piece of paper without touching planarians and add new 1x PAM water.",
    "Notes:For long-term storage, beef liver should be cut into small pieces (around 3-5 cm), wrapped in foil and frozen. When use it to feed planarians, remove the foil and cut it into small pieces with a scalpel. Be aware to cut some openings in the Tupperware cover to allow the gas exchange. Normally PAM water must be changed only after feeding. However, when mucus is clearly observed in the Tupperware walls, planarian water should be changed even if they have not been fed. You must be aware to avoid infections. To increase the planarian population, planarians can be cut at postpharyngeal level, which is the region that fissions during natural asexual reproduction. The fragments will completely regenerate the missing parts in two weeks. If planarians are big (> 0.5 cm) and a high increase in the population is desired, an additional cut can be performed prepharyngeally. The density of the planarians can be varied according to the specific requirements of each researcher. The culture showed in Figure 1B corresponds to a low-density culture. It can be increased up to 2-3 times more."
