    "1. Primer Design for PCR Amplification of Gene Flanks\nDownload to a word processing file the genomic region of the gene of interest (GOI) including the open reading frame (ORF) and at least 2 kb flanking the gene on each side from FungiDB or other genomic data resource.\nHighlight the ORF intended for deletion and label start and stop codons.\nIdentify and highlight adjacent ORFs within the downloaded sequence.\nUse the 2 kb 5' end of the GOI ORF and the primer design tool (see Materials List) to design PCR primer pair O1 and O2 to generate a minimum size product of 1 kb. Take care to not impact adjacent ORFs.\nPaste the 2 kb 5' flank into the \"Sequence Entry\" window. Click on \"Show Custom Parameters\" box. Enter the following custom design parameters: primer TM 58 (min), 60 (opt) and 62 (max); Primer GC 40 (min), 50 (opt) and 60 (max); Primer Size 22 (min), 24 (opt) and 26 (max); Amplicon Size 1250 (min), 1500 (opt) and 2000 (max).\nChoose the result that places the reverse primer (O2) closest to the ORF. Capture a screen shot of the assays and copy and paste the primer sequences into the word processing document.\nRepeat the process for 3' flank to generate primers O3 and O4, this time choose the result placing the forward primer (O3) closest to the target ORF.\nAdd appropriate attach sites to 5' ends of primers 1 through 4 (see Table 1).",
    "Also design and order ORF specific primers to be used for deletion confirmation in section 4 below. Parameters should be the same as in step 1.4.1 except use Amplicon Size 500 (min), 750 (opt) and 1000 (max) adjusting for length of ORF if necessary. Finally, for confirmation of homologous recombinants, generate 5' out and 3' out primers found just outside the flanks within the chromosome. These \"out\" primers will be used with hygR (210) and hygF (850), respectively (Fig 2).\nOrder primers.\n2. Production of OSCAR Constructs\nUsing a hi-fidelity Taq, carry out two reactions, one each for the 5' and 3' flanks, using primers (100 µM) O1 and O2 in one reaction and primers O3 and O4 in the second. Reaction mixture contains the following: 29.5 µL sterile distilled water (SDW), 5 µL 10x LA PCR buffer, 8 µL 2.5 mM dNTP mix, 5 µL 25 mM MgCl2, 1 µL template (50 ng/µL), 0.5 µL hi-fidelity Taq, 0.5 µL Primer O1 and 0.5 µL Primer O2 for 5' flank (or 0.5 µL Primer O3 and 0.5 µL Primer O4 for 3' flank) Use reaction conditions are as follows: 94 °C for 1 min, then 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 2 min, then final steps of 72 °C for 5 min and then hold indefinitely at 10 °C.\nRun 0.8% agarose 1x TAE (40 mM Tris acetate pH 8.3, 1 mM EDTA) gel electrophoresis for approximately 125 Vh in a standard minigel apparatus to determine product size and relative concentration. Post stain the gel with non-ethidium stain according to the manufacturer instructions. Visualize on a UV illuminator.",
    "If 5' and 3' flank products are in roughly even concentration, combine them and use an affinity column kit (or PEG precipitation 90 µL combined PCR products, 240 µL TE buffer pH 7.5, 160 µL of 30% polyethylene glycol PEG8000 30 mM MgCl2) to co-purify the PCR products according to the manufacturer's protocol. If they are not of equal concentration combine all of low concentration product with an estimated equal amount of product from the higher yield reaction.\nUse a spectrophotometer to measure purified DNA concentration.\nCarry out BP reaction by mixing the following: 1 µL of 60 ng/µL pOSCAR, 2 µL of 60 ng/µL pA-Hyg-OSCAR, 1 µL of 60 ng/µL combined flanks, 1 µL of clonase. Incubate for 16 h at 25 °C. Terminate the reaction by adding 0.5 µL proteinase K and incubate for 10 min at 37 °C.\nTransform high competence E. coli cells. Both commercially available competent cells and home-made DH5α CaCl2 competent cells were used successfully as recipients as described by the manufacturer's instructions. Plate on low sodium (0.5 g/L NaCl) LB containing 100 µg/mL spectinomycin (Spec).\nIdentify the correct construct by performing DNA minipreps10 of colonies generated above. Perform double digestion with HindIII and KpnI as follows: pipette 5 µL DNA, 2 U of each enzyme, 2 µL appropriate 10x buffer with SDW to a 20 µL total volume. This releases the insert (approximately 4.5 kb with 1.5 kb gene flanks) from the vector (ca. 7 kb) and cuts any sites in flanks which can give predictable band sizes.\nSequence11 select clones showing an appropriate banding pattern.\n3. Agrobacterium tumefaciens Mediated Transformation (ATMT) of Fungi\nTransform Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain AGL1 with OSCAR deletion construct12.\nTransform fungus with AGL1 containing the GOI OSCAR deletion plasmid. To do this carry out the following steps:",
    "Prepare a fungal spore suspension with sterile water at 2 x 106 spores/mL. Quantify spores on a hemocytometer or automated cell counter. Place 500 µL of this in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. This set up is for 4 transformation plates.\nUse a blue sterile disposable loop to add an easily visible gob (should cover about 20% of the loop diameter) of the deletion plasmid containing AGL1 from 2-3 day old LB-Spec 100 medium (see Materials List for composition) containing plates and mix into the spore suspension. Vortex till bacterial cells are well dispersed (ca. 5 min medium speed).\nPipette 100 µL of the conidia-Agro suspension onto the center of a cellulose membrane filter placed on each of four 6 cm Petri dishes containing co-cultivation medium12.\nSpread the suspension with sterile glass beads (about 4) to cover the whole surface of the membrane filter. Alternatively spread the suspension using a traditional spreader tool. Allow the membrane filter to dry in a hood for approximately 10 min, wrap with paraffin film. Repeat steps 3.2.2 and 3.2.3 to set up multiple transformations.\nIncubate the plate for 2 days at room temperature, inverted.\nTransfer the membrane filter onto 6 cm Aspergillus selection medium12 plates containing hygromycin B (Hyg) 150 µg/mL, 200 mM cefotaxime and 100 µg/mL moxalactam. Incubate at room temperature for 5-7 days before isolating Hyg resistant colonies.\nWith sterile toothpicks, transfer putative transformants onto 6 cm Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) plates containing 150 µg/mL Hyg, 100 µg/mL kanamycin.\n4. Deletion Mutant Identification by PCR\nExtract DNA for PCR from transformants by thermolysis13.",
    "Once transformants form colonies on the PDA from step 3.2.7, use a sterile toothpick to transfer a small amount (2 mm x 2 mm) of mycelium or yeast cells from the colony into 100 µL of lysis solution (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol) in a microcentrifuge tube.\nIncubate the mixture at 85-90 °C for 20-30 min. Store the crude extract containing genomic DNA at -20 °C until use in step 4.2.\nCarry out 4 PCR reactions per transformant, one each to detect homologous recombination of the 5' and 3' flanks, respectively, one for the selectable marker (hygromycin phosphotransferase in this case) and one for the GOI ORF.\n\tNOTE: We generally use inexpensive low-fidelity Taq for these reactions. Reaction conditions are as described in step 2.1 above and contain SDW 20 µL, 10x Taq buffer 2.5 µL, dNTPS (10 mM) 0.5 µL, homemade Taq14, 0.5 µL, Primer A (100 µM) 0.5 µL, Primer B (100 µM) 0.5 µL, Template 0.5 µL. Lower concentration primer stocks (10 µM) can be used equally well.\nRun an agarose gel (e.g. 0.8%) of the PCR products. Deletion mutants will produce the Hyg band but not an ORF product. Ectopic integrants will show both bands. Wild type will produce only the ORF band.\nPermanently store deletion mutants (and an ectopic transformant or two for controls) for future use.\n\tNOTE: 15% glycerol is used to store our strains long-term at -80 °C.\nSubscription Required.
