    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nProtein expression and purifications\nTiming: 3 days\nInduce and purify GST-AFC2 kinase and MBP-RSZ21 substrate protein, respectively.\nInduce GST-AFC2 protein expression.\nStreak a GST-AFC2 single colony into 5 mL of LB liquid medium supplemented with 50 μg/mL ampicillin and incubate at 37°C for 12–14 h at 230 rpm.\nTransfer all the bacterial culture into 300 mL of LB liquid medium supplemented with 50 μg/mL ampicillin and incubate at 37°C at 230 rpm until OD600 = 0.6–0.8.\nAdd 600 μL of 500 mM IPTG into 300 mL bacterial culture for the final IPTG concentration is 1 mM and incubate them at 37°C for 3 h at 230 rpm to induce protein expression.\nCentrifuge at 4°C for 10 min at 926 g to collect pellets.\nInduce MBP-RSZ21 protein expression.\nStreak a MBP-RSZ21 single colony into 5 mL of LB liquid medium supplemented with 50 μg/mL ampicillin and incubate at 37°C for 12–14 h at 230 rpm.\nTransfer all the bacterial culture into 300 mL of LB liquid medium supplemented with 50 μg/mL ampicillin and incubate at 37°C at 230 rpm until OD600 = 0.6–0.8.\nAdd 600 μL of 500 mM IPTG in 300 mL bacterial culture for the IPTG final concentration is 1 mM and incubate them at 30°C for 3 h at 230 rpm to induce protein expression.\nCentrifuge at 4°C for 10 min at 926 g to collect pellets.\nPause point: At this step, bacterial pellets can be stored at −80°C for one week until processing protein purifications.\nPurify GST-AFC2 protein and MBP-RSZ21 protein.\nAdd 20 mL of GST-lysis buffer into GST-AFC2 pellets and 20 mL of MBP column buffer into MBP-RSZ21 pellets, respectively. Transfer them into 50 mL centrifuge tubes and vortex to suspend bacteria pellets.\nNote: Pellets should be completely suspended.",
    "Add 200 μL of 100 mM PMSF, 200 μL of TritonX-100 and 50 μL of lysozyme solution into the suspended pellets, and then incubate at 4°C for 1 h with gentle shaking.\nNote: Proteinase inhibitor PMSF has short half-life (∼ 30 min) in the aqueous solution. Add 200 μL of 100 mM PMSF every half hour throughout the purification process.\nKeep the 50 mL centrifuge tubes on ice and lyse bacteria cells under sonication.\nNote: In this protocol, we used SONICS Ultrasonic Cell crusher (total sonication in 18–25 cycles, for each cycle: sonicate 15 s and pause 45 s).\nCentrifuge at 4°C for 18 min at 14,811 g and then collect supernatant.\nPre-clean columns. For GST-AFC2 protein purification, wash the column with 10 mL of 1 × PBS buffer for 3 times and then add 30 μL of glutathione Sepharose (Cytiva, Cat# 17075601) to the column. For MBP-RSZ21 protein purification, wash the column with MBP column buffer for 3 times and then add 30 μL of amylose resin (New England Biolabs, Cat# E8021S) to the column, wash with 10 mL of MBP column buffer for 4–5 times (invert to mix and then flow through the column).\nNote: Because the glutathione sepharose beads are stored in 20% ethanol, flow through the supernatant first and then wash with 10 mL of 1 × PBS buffer for 4–5 times (invert to mix and then flow through the column).\nNote: It is recommended to do the protein purification experiments (start from this step) in a cold room. Otherwise, keep all the solutions and columns cool (prepare solutions and store them in a 4°C freezer in advance).\nTransfer all the supernatant into the corresponding purification column.",
    "Note: The pellet in the 50 mL centrifuge tube contains bacterial debris. When transferring supernatant, use a disposable plastic pipette to gently pick up supernatant.\nIncubate the supernatant with beads at 4°C for 2 h with gentle shaking.\nNote: Prepare 10% separating gel and stacking gel at this time.\nFlow through the supernatant out of column.\nWash columns. For GST-AFC2 purification, wash the column with 10 mL of 1 × PBS buffer for 4–5 times. For MBP-RSZ21 protein purification, wash the column with MBP column buffer for 4–5 times.\nPrepare 1 mL of elution solution.\nNote: The elution solution varies according to the fusion tags and must be freshly prepared before use.\nFor protein elution, gently place 200 μL of elution solution to the column bottom and maintain for 1–2 min, then flow through the solution into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube (collection Eppendorf tube), label this Eppendorf tube as elution 1 and place this tube on ice immediately. Repeat this procedure for five time, to obtain five individual protein elution samples (elution 1–5).\nNote: Remove the washing buffer as much as possible. We used to keep the column vertical and sometimes close and open the column cap for more times to impose air pressure for pushing the washing buffer out of the column.\nNote: Eppendorf tubes should be labeled in advance to save time.\nTransfer 12 μL of eluted protein sample from each collection Eppendorf tube into another 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, add 4 μL of 4 × SDS loading buffer and place the Eppendorf tube at 100°C for 10 min.\nNote: Turn on the water bath or heater in advance.\nPerform routine SDS-PAGE electrophoresis to check the protein purification result.",
    "Coomassie brilliant blue stain for 1–2 h and then decolorizing for 8–12 h with decolored solution, image the gel and compare the protein purity and concentration among all the eluted samples.\nNote: After protein purification, it is recommended to carry out the downstream kinase assay immediately. Otherwise, the eluted protein samples can be aliquoted and stored in −80°C. Try to minimize the freeze and thaw cycles.\nNote: The concentration and purity of each eluted protein is not identical. In general, the concentration of the first elution is higher, but its purity is lower. One simple way to determine the protein concentration is to compare the corresponding band with the molecular weight marker. The separated band in the protein marker has its own concentration according to the product manual. For the purity issue, we choose the eluted sample with only one specific band on the gel. However, it is not uncommon to come across samples with multiple non-specific bands. They are still fine for downstream kinase assays when control experiments are properly included.\nPause point: The eluted proteins can be stored at −80°C.\nKinase reaction\nTiming: 2–3 h\nMonitor the GST-AFC2 kinase activity under different temperatures or chemical inhibitor treatment. The phosphorylation levels of MBP-RSZ21 are characterized to determine the AFC2 kinase activities (Lin et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nGST-AFC2 kinase assays at different temperatures.\nExperiment set up: test the kinase reactions at four different temperatures (22°C (positive control), 27°C, 32°C, 37°C).",
    "Add 8 μg of GST-AFC2 protein, 2 μg of MBP-RSZ21 protein and 80 μL of kinase reaction ATP buffer in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube for kinase reactions. We also set up a non-reaction negative control (Add 8 μg of GST-AFC2 protein, 2 μg of MBP-RSZ21 protein and 80 μL of kinase reaction ATP-free buffer in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube) at 22°C.\nNote: The exact protein concentration is determined with spectrophotometer.\nPut reaction Eppendorf tubes into Eppendorf ThermoMixer at different temperatures for 1 h (without shaking).\nAdd 40 μL of 4 × SDS loading buffer and place the Eppendorf tubes at 100°C for 10 min to stop reactions.\nNote: Try to start reactions simultaneously.\nPause point: The samples can be used for subsequent experiments immediately or stored at −80°C.\nGST-AFC2 kinase assays with chemical treatment.\nExperiment set up: test the kinase reactions under different dosage (30 μM or 100 μM) of TG-003 or Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, mock) treatment.\nAdd 8 μg of GST-AFC2 protein and different dosage of TG-003 or DMSO and 80 μL of kinase reaction ATP buffer in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. We also set up a positive control (8 μg of GST-AFC2 protein and 80 μL of kinase reaction ATP buffer) without TG-003 or DMSO and a non-reaction negative control (8 μg of GST-AFC2 protein and 80 μL of kinase reaction ATP-free buffer).\nKeep Eppendorf tubes at 22°C for 30 min for pre-reactions.\nAdd 8 μg of MBP-RSZ21 protein in pre-reaction Eppendorf tubes for kinase reactions.\nKeep Eppendorf tubes at 22°C for 1 h for kinase reactions.\nAdd 40 μL of 4 × SDS loading buffer and place Eppendorf tubes at 100°C for 10 min to stop reactions.\nNote: TG-003 is a reported CLK kinase inhibitor (Muraki et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Haltenhof et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).",
    "Pause point: The sample can be used for subsequent experiments immediately or stored at −80°C.\nActivity detection\nTiming: 2 days\nRun kinase reaction products on regular SDS-PAGE or Phos-tag SDS-PAGE.\nPerform SDS-PAGE electrophoresis as loading controls.\nPerform Phos-tag SDS-PAGE electrophoresis to separate the phosphorylated bands and non-phosphorylated bands.\nPrepare 8% Phos-tag gel and regular stacking gel.\nLoad samples into gel (from left lane to right lane): 5 μL of prestained protein marker, 5 μL of WIDE-VIEW prestained protein size marker III, 10 μL of each reaction product, 5 μL of WIDE-VIEW prestained protein size marker III and 5 μL of prestained protein marker.\nPerform the Phos-tag SDS-PAGE electrophoresis at 80 V in a cold room or on ice.\nNote: In general, perform the electrophoresis until the bromophenol dye reaches gel bottom edge. Electrophoresis time can be adjusted according to the actual protein molecular weight. The protein samples move relatively slow in the Phos-tag gel than in the stacking gel. Therefore you would perform the Phos-tag SDS-PAGE electrophoresis at 80 V for about 6–8 h.\nNote: Phos-tag SDS-PAGE is very sensitive to chelating agents such as EDTA. Avoid preparing samples with reagent containing EDTA, and use EDTA-free buffer when performing Phos-tag SDS-PAGE.\nNote: Due to the feature of phos-tag reagent, the regular prestained protein marker cannot separate well, commercial WIDE-VIEW prestained protein size marker III is recommended. But WIDE-VIEW staineded protein size marker cannot estimate molecular weight, so regular prestained protein marker is also required. If there are empty lanes, try to load the same volume of 4 × SDS loading buffer.\nAfter electrophoresis, cut the whole gel and wash the gel with 20 mL of Phos-tag transfer buffer with gentle shaking for 10 min. Repeat this washing step twice.",
    "Note: Prepare a square plastic petri dish for washing the gel with Phos-tag transfer buffer. The EDTA contained in the Phos-tag transfer buffer can chelate Mn2+ and improve the efficiency of protein transfer.\nNote: The concentration range of EDTA is 1–10 mM, and its concentration can be chosen according to the experiment.\nWash the gel with 20 mL of 1 × transfer buffer for 10 min with gentle shaking in a cold room (4°C).\nNote: 1 × transfer buffer was used to clean the EDTA chelated with metal ions on the gel surface to improve the efficiency of protein transfer.\nTransfer proteins to nitrocellulose membrane (NC membrane) using wet transferring system at 100 V for 60 min on ice.\nNote: Keeping the protein transfer tank on ice prevents temperature rise and improve the protein transfer efficiency.\nBlock the membrane with 5% skim milk in a cold room (4°C) for 2 h or overnight (8–12 h) with gentle shaking.\nWash the membrane with 1 × PBST buffer briefly.\nIncubate with the primary antibody against the target protein in 1 × PBST buffer in a cold room (4°C) for 2 h or overnight (8–12 h) with gentle shaking.\nWash the membrane with 15 mL of 1 × PBST buffer for 10 min in a cold room (4°C) with gentle shaking. Discard the buffer, and repeat washing for three times.\nIncubate the membrane with corresponding secondary antibody in 1 × PBST buffer for 1 h in a cold room (4°C).\nWash the membrane with 15 mL of 1 × PBST buffer for 10 min in a cold room (4°C) with gentle shaking. Discard the buffer, and repeat washing for three times.\nAdd 400 μL of mixed enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) solution to the membrane.",
    "Note: The ECL solution consists of solution A and solution B. 200 μL of solution A and 200 μL of solution B were mixed in a petri dish. Use a disposable pipette to gently cover the mixed ECL solution on the membrane surface for about 10 times.\nNote: If fluorescent secondary antibody is used, the ECL solution is not required.\nRemove excess ECL solution.\nNote: The dilution ratio of the primary antibody and the secondary antibody should be optimized according to the antibody sensitivity and protein concentrations.\nNote: The ECL solution treatment time varies among different suppliers. Refer to the product manual and adjust the reaction time accordingly.\nThe luminescent signal on the membrane was recorded with a charge-coupled device (CCD) based gel imaging system.\nAlternatives: The luminescent signal on the membrane is also suitable for a traditional film development system. If film developer machine and dark room are available, you can use this system to detect signals on the membrane.\nNote: The buffer and the Phos-tag gel used for the Phos-tag SDS-PAGE electrophoresis must be freshly prepared."
