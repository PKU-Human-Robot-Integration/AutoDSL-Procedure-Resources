    "1. Peptide Serial Dilution\nPrepare assay buffer: Hanks buffered salt solution (HBSS) supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, 0.1% BSA and 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), pH 7.4.\nUse a bulk reagent dispenser to systematically add 5 µl of assay buffer to each well of five 384-well low volume assay plates.\n\t\nUse internal software to create a dispensing program for 5 µl volume addition to every well of a 384-well plate as per manufacturer's instructions.\nImmerse dispensing cassette tubing in assay buffer and prime fluid.\nPlace 384-well low volume assay plate on plate carrier.\nPress start.\nDilute all peptide samples, regardless of storage vehicle, into assay buffer to produce a 100x peptide stock.\n\tNOTE: Peptides requiring screening may be provided in Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as is deemed appropriate (e.g., DMSO will have a deleterious effect on peptides with secondary modifications such as PEGylation).\nDispense 25 µl 100x peptide stocks into columns 1-5 of an acoustically qualified 384-well polypropylene microplate. This plate is designated 'source plate A'. Ensure that source plates, but not destination plates, are flat bottomed and conform to specific acoustic tolerances as defined by the manufacturer of acoustic instruments.\nDispense 25 µl 100x reference control into wells A23 and A24 of source plate A.\nDispense 10 µl assay buffer into columns 11-15 and 30 µl assay buffer into columns 21-22 of source plate A.\nDispense 10 µl assay buffer into columns 6-10 and columns 16-20 of a second acoustically qualified 384-well polypropylene microplate. This plate is designated 'source plate B'.\nCentrifuge source plates A and B at 300 x g for 1 min. Include an appropriate balance plate.",
    "Use acoustic fluid dispensers integrated into an automated robotic system to prepare three sequential 1:100 intermediate dilutions (in assay buffer) of the 100x peptide stocks from column 1 in source A.\n\tNOTE: Programming requires plate reformatting and dose response software (as provided by the manufacturer of the acoustic fluid dispenser) to allow three acoustic transfers between source A and source B (see Figure 1 for plate layouts). Step 1.9 details specifically the use of fluid dispensers used in this laboratory under automated robotic control (see Materials Table):\n\t\nLoad source plates and assay plates into plate hotel section of robotics.\nOpen automated robotic software and load plate reformatting and dose response program expansion protocols. Click 'Run'.",
    "NOTE: Automation instructs an acoustic fluid dispenser to transfer 250 nl from columns 1-5 of source plate A into columns 6-10 of source plate B, and a second acoustic fluid dispenser capable of handling larger fluid volumes to backfill with 15 µl assay buffer to mix. Automation then transfers source plate B to integrated centrifuge and centrifuges at 300 x g for 1 min (an appropriate balance plate is included for all centrifugation steps). Source plate B is returned to the acoustic fluid dispenser for the transfer of 250 nl from columns 6-10 of source plate B into columns 11-15 of source plate A and backfill with 15 µl assay buffer to mix. Automation transfers source plate A to integrated centrifuge and centrifuges at 300 x g for 1 min. Source plate A is then returned to the acoustic fluid dispenser for the transfer of 250 nl from columns 11-15 of source plate A into columns 16-20 of source plate B and backfill with 15 µl assay buffer to mix. Automation then transfers source plate B to integrated centrifuge and centrifuges at 300 x g for 1 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Finally the dose response protocol directs acoustic dispensing to transfer the required volume from each of the 4 serially diluted source plate wells (in both source plate A and source plate B) to construct a full 11-point curve in duplicate in assay plates (pre-filled with 5 µl assay buffer in step 1.2 above). Automation transfers assay plate to integrated centrifuge and centrifuges at 300 x g for 1 min.\n2. Cell Preparation\nThaw cryopreserved Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing the target mouse GLP-1 receptor rapidly in a 37 ºC water bath and resuspend in 20 ml assay buffer.",
    "Centrifuge cell suspension for 5 min at 200 x g at room temperature (RT). Include an appropriate balance.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in 10 ml assay buffer.\nDilute cell stock 1:1 in Trypan blue and determine viable cell density using an automated cell counter. Resuspend cells in assay buffer at 1.6 x 106 cells per ml (equivalent to 8,000 cells per well of assay plates).\nUse a bulk reagent dispenser to add 5 µl of cell suspension to each well of the assay plates (containing serially diluted peptides in 5 µl assay buffer) and incubate at RT for 30 min.\n3. HTRF cAMP Detection Assay\nBring HTRF cAMP assay kit to RT for 30 min prior to use.\nPrepare each HTRF reagent (cryptate and d2) separately at 1:20 dilution in lysis buffer (proprietary formulation, provided by manufacturer of cAMP detection assay).\n\tNOTE: CAUTION: Lysis buffer contains potassium fluoride (KF) which is toxic and a teratogen13. For disposal, assay plates containing KF should be sealed and incinerated, and any liquid waste must be diluted to <1 mmol/L with water prior to disposal down the sink.\nUse a bulk reagent dispenser to add 5 µl cryptate reagent to all wells of the assay plates.\nUse a bulk reagent dispenser to add 5 µl d2 reagent to columns 1-22 of the assay plates.\nImmediately manually pipette 5 µl lysis buffer into wells A23-D24 of the assay plates to give non-specific binding (NSB) control wells, and 5 µl of d2 reagent into wells E23-P24.\nCentrifuge the assay plates for 1 min at 200 x g at RT to mix the wells.\nCover the assay plates to minimize evaporation and photo-bleaching and incubate at RT for 1 hr.",
    "Measure fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signal using excitation at 320 nm and emission at 620 nm and 665 nm using a plate reader.\n4. Data Analysis\nUse mean NSB to subtract background from all wells.\nCalculate %Delta F from the 665 nm/620 nm ratio as follows:\n\tRatio = (A665nm/A620nm) x 104\n\tDelta F = ((Sample Ratio - RatioNSB)/RatioNSB)) x 100\n\twhere RatioNSB = wells with no d2 reagent.\nCalculate % activation between unstimulated cells and cells stimulated with maximum GLP-1 ligand as follows:\n\t% activation = (%Delta Fsample - %DeltaFunstimulated cells)/(%DeltaFGLP-1 stimulated cells - %DeltaF unstimulated cells) x 100\nAnalyze concentration-response curves via 4-parameter logistical analysis, and graph as % activation as defined by reference control1.\nSubscription Required.
