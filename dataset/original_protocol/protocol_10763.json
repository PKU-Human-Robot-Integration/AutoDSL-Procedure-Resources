    "1. MEA Preparation\nMEAs for use in electroporation experiments can either be fabricated using standard photolithography technique as described previously18 or purchased directly from vendors of MEA manufacturers such as Multi Channel Systems (http:/www.multichannelsystems.com/)[href=http://www.multichannelsystems.com] and Alpha MED Scientific, Inc. (http://www.MED64.com)[href=http://www.med64.com/].The MEAs used in our experiments were fabricated in-house at the clean room facility in Arizona State University, which is administered by the Center for Solid State Electronics Research (CSSER). The MEAs used in our experiments had 32 indium tin oxide electrodes in an 8 by 4 array with electrode diameter sizes from 50-200 μm within a 1 cm inner diameter glass well. The glass well was bonded on the MEA using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS).\nSterilize the MEA in an autoclave prior to cell seeding. Other methods of sterilization such as a soaking in 70% ethanol, UV treatment and hot water treatment as described elsewhere can also be used as long they do not compromise the integrity of the MEA.\nTransfer the autoclaved MEA to a laminar flow hood and place it in a standard sterile polystyrene Petri dish. Prior to seeding cells on the MEA, sterilize the laminar flow hood by turning on the UV light for 20 min. If the MEA is sensitive to UV light cover the Petri dish containing the MEA with sterile aluminum foil while the flow hood is under UV illumination.\n2. Seeding Cells on the MEA\nHarvest cells from a running cell line of adherent mammalian cells using Trypsin/EDTA and raise them to a concentration of 100-200 cells/μl in 1 ml cell media for plating. In our experiments we have been successful in culturing NIH 3T3 fibroblasts cell line, HeLa cell line and primary cortical and hippocampal neurons on the MEA.",
    "Place a 20-30 μl drop of media with cells on the MEA. Transfer the Petri dish with the MEA to the incubator. It is important to ensure that the cell drop size is large enough to cover all the electrodes on the MEA.\n2 hr after seeding the cells transfer the Petri dish with the MEA from the incubator to laminar flow hood and gently add 400-500 μl of pre warmed media (37 °C) to the MEA well. Check under the microscope to ensure that cells are still attached and evenly spread on the MEA surface. Transfer the MEA back to the incubator. The 2 hr wait period before the addition of media ensures enough time for the cells to adhere with the MEA surface. Addition of cell media too soon after seeding the cells can wash away the cells. If cells do not adhere well on the MEA, its surface can be treated with cell attachment factors such aspolylysine, fibronectin, and laminin to improve cell adhesion. In our HeLa cell experiments we typically treat the MEA surface with fibronectin (10 μg/ml) for 1-2 hr.\n8-12 hr after seeding the cells, perform 1-2 washes with PBS to remove any dead cells. Cell medium can replaced every 24-48 hr as needed. In a typical experiment, the cells are usually ready for transfection 24-48 hr after seeding. To maintain consistency in electroporation efficiency it is recommended to wait until the culture is at least 80% confluent before electroporation.\n3. Site-specific Transfection of siRNA\nPrepare nucleic acid solution. For siRNA transfection, prepare a 1-2 μM siRNA electroporation solution in ice cold electroporation buffer to attain a final volume of 200-400 μl. In this video article we demonstrate the transfection of HeLa cells with Alexa 488 conjugated scrambled sequence of siRNA.",
    "Transfer the MEA with cells from the incubator to sterile laminar flow hood. Remove the cell media from the MEA and perform a wash with PBS. Thereafter, add 200-400 μl of the ice cold 1 μM siRNA electroporation solution to the well.\nApply anodic square electric pulses to the targeted electrodes (Refer to step 4 for determining optimal parameters of the electric pulse). In our experiments we used a Pragmatic Instruments 2414A waveform generator to generate electric pulses and a dual-inline-package (DIP) 16 pin clip to make contact with the MEA bond pads. The waveform generator can be connected to the DIP clip via a demultiplexor printed circuit board to provide selectivity of individual electrodes. For the reference electrode, place a steel cathode in the cell media. While lowering the steel reference electrode in the media it is extremely important to ensure that it does not make contact with the MEA surface. Upon contact, it can cause damage to the cells and the MEA. It is recommended to lower the reference electrode to a position of 1 mm above the cells. A spacer with a height of 1 mm can be placed in the well to assist in placement of the reference electrode. An alternate approach to using an external reference electrode is to use neighboring electrodes as cathode-anode pairs.\nImmediately after applying the electric pulses to the targeted electrodes on the MEA, transfer the MEA back to the incubator. After an incubation period of 5 min, gently replace 75% of the electroporation buffer with pre-warmed (37 °C) cell media. Later, fluorescent imaging can be done to confirm the delivery of fluorescently tagged siRNA to the cells.\n4. Electroporation Parameter Optimization",
    "To determine the optimal electric pulse parameters for electroporation, design electroporation experiments for a range of values of pulse amplitude, pulse duration, and number of pulses. In our experience with HeLa cells, we observed that a single voltage pulse of amplitude from 3 V to 9 V, and duration from 1 msec to 10 msec for an electrode size of 100 μm led to successful electroporation with minimal cell death. It is our recommendation that one parameter be varied at a time and others are kept constant. To quantitate the electroporation efficiency for each of the pulse parameters, we use propidium iodide (PI), a cell impermeant dye that stains nucleic material, and live assay based methodology, as described in steps 4.2-4.5.\nEstablish a cell culture on the MEA following the directions outlined in steps 1 and 2.\nPrior to electroporation prepare a 300-500 μl of 30 μg/ml PI solution in ice cold electroporation buffer and 400 μl of 4 μM calcien AM solution in PBS.\nTransfer the MEA from the incubator to the laminar flow hood. Remove the cell media from the MEA and perform a wash with PBS. Thereafter, add 300-500 μl of the ice cold electroporation buffer with PI.",
    "Apply electric pulses with desired pulse amplitude and duration to the targeted electrodes (The equipment used in our experiments for generating and applying the electric pulse to the MEA is described in step 3.3). For the reference electrode either lower a steel electrode into the electroporation buffer in the MEA well or use the neighboring electrode as reference. By selectively applying pulses of varying amplitudes or durations to different electrodes multiple experiments can be performed on the same device. For example, on a 32 electrode MEA, 8 experiments can be performed by splitting the 32 electrodes in 8 groups, each consisting of 4 electrodes. Each of the 8 groups can then be stimulated by a single rectangular voltage pulse of duration 5 msec with amplitudes varying in 3 V-6 V range in 0.5 V increments and one group can be used as a control.\nImmediately after applying the voltage pulses transfer the MEA to the incubator for 5 min. Afterwards, gently remove 75% of the electroporation buffer from the MEA well and replace it with warm cell media. Transfer the MEA back to the incubator.\nAfter an incubation period of 2-4 hr replace the cell media in the MEA well with 300-500 μl of 4 μM Calcein AM solution in PBS. Transfer the MEA back to incubator for another 30 min.",
    "Following the incubation of the cells with Calcein AM, replace the Calcein AM solution in the MEA well with PBS after two washes with PBS. Obtain fluorescent images of cells using with an optical microscope with filters for PI (Excitation/Emission - 535 nm/617 nm) and Calcein AM (Excitation/Emission - 490 nm/520 nm). The uptake of PI, due to electroporation, causes cells to fluoresce red and the Calcein AM causes cells that are alive to fluoresce green. Three possible scenarios that can be observed are 1) cell electroporated and alive (will fluoresce both red and green), 2) Cells alive but not electroporated (will fluoresce just green) and 3) Cells dead due to electroporation (will fluoresce just red). The cell viability was calculated as a percent of the total number of cells alive on the electrode and the electroporation efficiency was calculated as percent of the total number of cells loaded with PI/siRNA.\n5. Representative Results\nFigure 1 shows the site-specific loading of HeLA cells with PI. It can be observed that only cells on the electrode demonstrate an uptake of PI (Figure 1B). A live assay performed post electroporation was used to assess the viability of cells (Figure 1A). The electroporation efficiency and cell viability for the example shown in Figure 1 are 81.8 % and 96.1 % respectively. High cell viability and electroporation efficiency can be achieved by optimizing the electroporation pulse parameters. Site-specific transfection of HeLA cells with fluorescently tagged siRNA for an optimized electroporation pulse (8 V, 1 msec) is shown in Figure 2. The electroporation efficiency for the siRNA at 8 V, 1 msec was found to be 74.4 ± 16.0 % and cell viability was found to be 87.9 ± 8.4 % (all data represented as mean ± standard deviation, N=5).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4415/4415fig1.jpg",
