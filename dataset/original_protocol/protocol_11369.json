    "All samples were obtained with the informed consent of the children's parents or guardians and approval of Ethical committee of Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic, the study no. NV15-28848A.\n1. Preparation of Reagents\nPrepare 500 mL of PBS by dissolving 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 4.3 mM Na2HPO4, 1.47 mM KH2PO4, in ddH2O. Adjust the pH to 7.4 with HCl. Sterilize by autoclaving.\nPrepare 100 mL of RPMI medium: RPMI-1640 medium with L-Alanyl-Glutamine supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 U/mL) and streptomycin (100 μg/mL).\nPrepare 50 mL of 0.1 M NaHCO3 in distilled water. Adjust the pH to 8.1, filter sterilize (0.22 μm) and store at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: For two 8-well extracellular flux analyzer plates, prepare 250 μL of 0.1 M NaHCO3 pH 8.1.\nPrepare 1 mL of 2 M D-glucose in distilled water. Filter sterilize (0.22 μm) and store at -20 °C.\nPrepare 100 μL of 1 mM Oligomycin A in ethanol. Filter sterilize (0.22 μm) and store at -20 °C.\nPrepare 250 μL of 1 M 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) in Minimal DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium). Warm to 37 °C and adjust the pH to 7.4 (carry out pH measurement at 37 °C). Filter sterilize (0.22 μm) and store at -20 °C.\nPrepare 100 μL of 1 mM FCCP (carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone) in DMSO. Filter sterilize (0.22 μm) and store at -20 °C.\nPrepare 100 μL of 1 mM Rotenone in ethanol. Filter sterilize (0.22 μm) and store at -20 °C.\nPrepare 100 μL of 1 mg/mL Antimycin A in ethanol. Filter sterilize (0.22 μm) and store at -20 °C.",
    "Just before the use, prepare 10 mL of Glycolysis stress test medium. Warm Minimal DMEM to 37 °C in a water bath and adjust the pH to 7.4 (carry out pH measurement at 37 °C).\nPrior to the use, prepare 10 mL of Cell Mito stress test medium with BSA. Supplement Minimal DMEM with 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM D-glucose, 1 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mM pyruvate and 0.1 % BSA (bovine serum albumin). Warm to 37 °C in a water bath and adjust the pH to 7.4 (carry out pH measurement at 37 °C).\nPrior to the use, prepare 10 mL of Cell Mito stress test medium without BSA. Supplement Minimal DMEM with 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM D-glucose,1 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) and 1 mM pyruvate. Warm Cell Mito stress test medium without BSA to 37 °C in a water bath and adjust the pH to 7.4 (carry out pH measurement at 37 °C).\n\tNOTE: BSA is added to the Cell Mito stress test medium because the cells respond better to FCCP when the medium is supplemented with BSA (different conditions were tested). Cell Mito stress test medium without BSA is used for loading the ports as the manufacturer does not recommend using BSA in the medium.\n2. Isolation of Mononuclear Cells from Bone Marrow\nNOTE: Ideally, measurement of metabolic state of primary leukemia cells should start immediately after bone marrow collection and cell isolation. Nevertheless, relevant data could be also obtained from cells isolated after transportation from other hematology centers in the Czech Republic. Perform all sub-steps in a sterile tissue culture hood.\nWarm up PBS and the density gradient medium to room temperature.",
    "Dilute the bone marrow sample of leukemia patient with PBS, in a ratio of 1:1. Make sure that the sample contains at least 80% of leukemic blasts.\nDetermine the percentage of blasts by flow cytometry using specific CD markers for immunophenotype characterization of cell types. After density gradient separation, detect nucleic acid positive events with a nuclear dye in order to establish the overall cell count.\nThen, determine leukemia cells using specific CD markers for each type of leukemia: B-ALL (CD19, CD45), T-ALL (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD5, CD7, CD99) and AML (CD45, CD33, and specific myeloid markers)24. Divide the number of leukemia cells positive for specific CD markers by all nuclear cells to determine the percentage of leukemia blast cells.\n\tNOTE: The bone marrow has to be collected into the tubes with anticoagulants.\nCarefully layer 6 mL of diluted bone marrow sample over 6 mL of the density gradient medium in a 15 mL conical tube. Centrifuge at 400 x g for 35 min at 4 °C in a swinging-bucket rotor without the brake.\n\tNOTE: Larger volume of the sample could be divided into more aliquots or 50 mL conical tube can be used with the larger amount of density gradient medium.\nUsing a Pasteur pipette, carefully transfer the interphase layer which consists of mononuclear cells (Figure 1) to a new 50 mL conical tube with 5 mL of PBS. Centrifuge at 400 × g for 10 min at 4 °C in a swinging-bucket rotor.\n\tNOTE: Transfer all mononuclear cell layers into a single 50 mL conical tube with 5 mL of PBS.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 2 mL of sterile PBS. Count the cells using a hemocytometer.\n\tNOTE: The number of leukemia cells in one mL of aspirated bone marrow differs significantly among patients25.",
    "3. Overnight Cultivation of Mononuclear Cells\nNOTE: Perform all sub-steps in a sterile tissue culture hood.\nPrepare two T75 flasks with 20 mL of RPMI. To each flask, add 30 x 106 isolated mononuclear cells. Incubate the cells with the flask standing up for 16–24 h at 5% CO2 and 37 °C.\n4. Preparation of Cell Adhesive-coated Plates\nCoat two 8-well extracellular flux analyzer plates.\n\tNOTE: Perform the coating in a sterile tissue culture hood.\nAdd 2.2 μL of cell adhesive(density: 2.54 mg/ml) to 250 μL of 0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 8.1, and pipette immediately 12.5 μL of the solution into each well.\n\tNOTE: Cell adhesive stock solutions can differ in their density, adjust the volume added to NaHCO3 accordingly.\nLet the plates sit in the hood for about 20 min, then aspirate the cell adhesive and wash each well twice using 200 μL of sterile water. Let it sit in the hood with the lid open until wells are dry.\nUse the plates right away or save up to 1 week at 4 °C with the rim wrapped in paraffin film to avoid condensation. Ensure that the plates are warmed up to room temperature (for about 20 min) in the hood before seeding the cells.\n5. Hydration of Sensor Cartridge\nNOTE: Hydrate two 8-well extracellular flux analyzer cartridges.\nSeparate the utility plate and the sensor cartridge. Place the sensor cartridge upside down on the lab bench.\nFill each well of the utility plate with 200 μL calibrant. Fill each moat around the outside of the wells with 400 μL of calibrant.\nReturn the sensor cartridge to the utility plate that now contains the calibrant.\nPlace the cartridge assembly in a humidified, non-CO2, 37 °C incubator overnight.",
    "Turn on the extracellular flux analyzer and let it warm to 37 °C overnight.\n6. Seeding Cells in Cell Adhesive-coated Plates\nNOTE: For Glycolysis stress test, use Glycolysis stress test medium. For Cell Mito stress test, use Cell Mito stress test medium with BSA.\nSeed cells for the Glycolysis stress test and the Cell Mito stress test in separate plates. For each test, use cells from one flask with overnight culture.\nCentrifuge cells at 200 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Resuspend cells in 1 mL of the appropriate medium and count them.\nAdd 4 x 106 of live cells to the final volume of 400 μL (use appropriate medium).\nPlate 50 μL of the cell suspension into wells B-G. Ensure 500,000 cells are seeded in one well.\n\tNOTE: It is crucial to seed exactly 500,000 cells per well as no other normalization is performed. That way, the results from different patients can be compared. The optimal number of replicates is six, as is described here. Using less replicates is not recommended since primary cells could sometimes behave erroneously.\nAdd 180 μL of the appropriate medium into wells A and H (these wells will serve as a background correction).\nCentrifuge the plate at 400 x g for 5 min at room temperature with brake set to 1.\nAdd 130 μL of appropriate medium to wells B-G in two 8-well extracellular flux analyzer plates slowly and carefully. Visually confirm that the cells are stably adhered to the bottom of the wells by viewing under the microscope.\nPlace the plate into a humidified, non-CO2, 37 °C incubator for 30 min.\n7. Loading the Sensor Cartridge",
    "For the Glycolysis stress test, prepare 250 μL each of 100 mM glucose, 20 μM Oligomycin A and 1 M 2-DG, all in Glycolysis stress test medium.\nFor the Cell Mito stress test, prepare 250 μL each of 20 μM Oligomycin A, 15 μM FCCP, 30 μM FCCP and a mixture of 10 μM Rotenone and 10 μg/ml Antimycin A, all in Cell Mito stress test medium without BSA.\n\tNOTE: Injecting two concentrations of FCCP in one assay is recommended since there is not enough patients' material for the FCCP titration. Nevertheless, the concentrations should be determined by the researcher.\nLoad the compounds into the appropriate injector ports of the cartridge as follows (Table 1):\n8. Setting Up the Program\nFor the Glycolysis stress test, set up the program as described in Table 2.\nFor the Cell Mito stress test, set up the program as described in Table 3.\nStart the program. Replace the calibrant plate with the assay plate (when prompted).\n9. Evaluation and Interpretation of the Results\nIn the Glycolysis stress test results, subtract the lowest ECAR value after 2-DG injection from all other ECAR values.\n\tNOTE: This lowest value represents the non-glycolytic acidification. Usually, the lowest value is from the 4th measurement.\nCalculate Basal acidification, Glycolysis, Maximal glycolysis and Glycolytic reserve parameters from glycolytic function (Figure 2A). After subtracting the lowest ECAR value, calculate Basal acidification as a mean of ECAR from the first three measurement points (omit the first ECAR value if it significantly differs from the other two), calculate Glycolysis as a mean of ECAR from three measurement points after glucose injection and calculate Maximal glycolysis as a mean of ECAR from three measurement points after Oligomycin A injection. Calculate Glycolytic reserve as Maximal glycolysis minus Glycolysis.",
    "NOTE: Alternatively, for Maximal glycolysis calculation, use the highest ECAR value from the three points measured.\nIn the Cell Mito stress test results, subtract the lowest OCR value after Rotenone/Antimycin A injection from all other OCR values.\nCalculate Basal respiration, ATP production, Maximal respiration and Spare capacity parameters from mitochondrial function (Figure 2B). After subtracting the lowest OCR value, calculate Basal respiration as a mean of OCR from the first three measurement points.\n\tNOTE: Maximal respiration is the highest OCR value after FCCP injection.\nFor ATP production calculation, subtract the mean of the three OCR measurement points after Oligomycin A injection from Basal respiration. Calculate Spare capacity as the Maximal respiration minus the Basal respiration.\n\tNOTE: Always calculate the Maximal respiration from the highest OCR value, regardless of the FCCP concentration used.\nSubscription Required.
