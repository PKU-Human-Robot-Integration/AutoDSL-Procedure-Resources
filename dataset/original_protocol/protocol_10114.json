    "The protocol follows the animal care guidelines of King Saud University's ethical committee. Surgical procedures, anesthetics, and other medications used on animals are approved by King Saud University's ethical committee. All experimental work is performed by appropriately trained personnel.\n1. Cell Sheet Construction\nCoat the culture dishes (3.5-cm temperature-responsive culture dishes) with undiluted fetal bovine serum (FBS) and ensure to cover all the surface of the dish.\n\tNOTE: This step is important for the detachment of the cell sheet since it supports the growth of the cells in a monolayer and prevents cell aggregation.\nIncubate the dishes for 24 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 95% air.\nRemove the excess FBS from the coated dishes and allow the dishes to dry at room temperature (RT) for at least 1 h.\nPrepare the three cell suspensions: 1 x 106 HepG2 cells, 1 x 106 HepG2 cells with BMMSCs, and 1 x 106 HepG2 cells with UCMSCs (in a ratio of 4:1 for both BMMSCs and UCMSCs).\nSeed the appropriate cell suspension to each labeled dish.\nSuspend all cells in DMEM culture medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 95% air.\n2. Cell Sheet Detachment\nAt 100% cell confluence, take the dishes out of the 37 °C incubator.\nIncubate the HepG2 cell sheet dish for 1 h at RT, while incubating the HepG2/BMMSC and HepG2/UCMSC cell sheet dishes for 30 - 40 min at 20 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 95% air.\n\tNOTE: The cell sheet made from only HepG2 is fragile; reducing the temperature to 20 °C causes damages to the structure of the sheet.\n3. Performance of the Surgical Procedure",
    "Note: During the incubation time for the cell sheet detachment, start the animal procedure.\nInstructions for the preparation of the surgery area\nConduct all surgical procedures in a sterile separate area within the laboratory, such as a hood, laminar flow cabinet, or an aseptic surgery room. Ensure that all surfaces of the surgery area are non-porous, sealed, durable, and sanitizable.\nWear proper protective gear, including scrubs, gloves, facemasks, and head and shoe covers.\nUse surgical tools that are clean and sterilized (via autoclaving; saturated stem under high pressure) at the beginning of the surgery.\nChange gloves between rats.\nPreparation of the animal for surgery\nUse 8- to 12-week-old nude rats.\nCreate injectable anesthesia for rats.\n\t\t\nTo prepare the anesthesia solution, ketamine-xylazine, mix 2 mL of ketamine, 1 mL of xylazine (at a concentration of 20 mg/mL), and 1 mL of sterile physiologic saline (e.g., 0.9% sodium chloride) in a sterile 10-mL serum collection vial and shake well before use.\nTo apply anesthesia, inject 0.2 mL of the ketamine-xylazine solution per 100 g of body weight of the rat intraperitoneally.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The total dose of the solution is 100 mg/kg of ketamine and 10 mg/kg of xylazine.\nRemove visible dirt/debris from the surgical site.\nCheck the depth of anesthesia by testing the pedal withdrawal reflex (foot pad pinch on both hind feet).\n\t\tNOTE: If the foot pad pinch causes a response, repeat at a dose of 0.05 mL/100 g (approximately every 30 min), then recheck the anesthetic depth.\nDisinfect the surgery area with a two-stage scrub by povidone-iodine/isopropanol.\nCover the rat with a sterile drape to avoid contamination of the incision.\nInject the rats subcutaneously with buprenorphine (0.01 - 0.05 mg/kg)8 prior to making the incision.",
    "Using a sterile scalpel, make a 7- to 10-cm cut between the skins and underlying muscles to expose the liver.\n\t\t\nSeparate the abdominal muscle from the skin with the flat back edge of the scalpel.\nCarefully stab the linea alba using a scalpel and extend the cut with sharp scissors.\n4. Cell Sheet Transplantation\nNote: Cell sheet transplantation is performed on the liver .\nCollect the cell sheet from the culture dish.\n\t\nGently tap the culture dish over the bench to detach the sheet from its surface.\nSeparate the cell sheet from the dish's surface by scraping the edge of the sheet in a half circle using a sterile pipette tip.\nGently remove the entire medium from the culture dish.\nEnsure the sheet is intact without any damage; otherwise, it cannot be used (Figure 1).\n\t\tNOTE: The resulting sheets can be detected directly by the eye.\nPrepare a sterile membrane (filter paper) to harvest the cell sheet from the dish.\n\t\nFirst, soak the membrane with normal saline. Then, remove the excess saline with a sterile cotton pad.\nPlace the wet membrane over the cell sheet, while avoiding creases and air bubbles between the membrane and the cell sheet.\nAdd few drops of normal saline over the membrane and the cell sheet to collect them easier.\n\t\tNote: To avoid breaking the cell sheet, do not use cold saline and lift the membrane and the cell sheet with forceps.\nLeave the membrane for a few seconds to ensure that the cell sheet is properly attached to the membrane, and then collect it.\nPrepare the liver for cell sheet transplantation.\n\t\nMake sure the liver surface is dry by gently tapping it with a sterile cotton pad.",
    "Using sterile forceps, place the membrane with the cell sheet over a single lobe of the rat's liver.\nAdd a few drops of sterile saline and apply a gentle pressure to the membrane to detach the cell sheet from it.\nWait for 5 min before carefully removing the membrane.\n\t\tNOTE: This is done to ensure the cell sheet is properly attached to the liver.\nFinally, close the underlying muscles and skin incisions with 5-0 nylon sutures.\nDisinfect the surgery area with povidone-iodine.\n\t\tNote: Figure 2 shows a diagram of the cell sheet transplantation procedure on the liver of a nude rat.\n5. Post-surgery Care\nImmediately after the surgery, house the rat individually to avoid cannibalism or suffocation, and monitor it regularly (at least every 15 min) until it is conscious and fully ambulant.\nThen, assess the rats daily for 5 - 14 d, at least 5 d post-operatively, to ensure that there are no complications. During the daily assessment, make sure of the following.\n\t\nThe wound is closed, and the sutures are intact, without being excessively tight.\nThere are no signs of infection in the incision site, such as heat, excessive swelling, or purulent discharge.\nThere are no signs associated with pain, such as decreased food and water consumption, weight loss, dehydration, skin tenting, or rapid and open mouth breathing. To control moderate to severe post-surgery pain, if any, inject the rats subcutaneously with buprenorphine (0.01 - 0.05 mg/kg) every 6 - 8 h9 for a minimum of 48 - 72 h postoperatively.\n6. Analysis of the Transplanted Area\nOne month after the transplantation, scarifice the rat and collect the transplanted area for histological and immunohistochemical analysis.\nSubscription Required.
