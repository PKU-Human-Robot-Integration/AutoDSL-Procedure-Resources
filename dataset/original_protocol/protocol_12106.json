    "NOTE: This protocol has three parts: 1) observing the pattern formation in wild-type Arabidopsis embryos using DIC microscopy; 2) characterizing the embryo pattern formation via the observation of marker protein expression using confocal laser scanning microscopy; and 3) determining the role of a specific gene in embryogenesis (using the naa10 mutant as an example).\n1. Ovule Clearing\nPlant material preparation\n\tNOTE: The protocol described here is an example on how to grow healthy plants; other ways to grow healthy plants also work.\n\t\nAdd 100 seeds to a 1.5 mL tube, and then add 1 mL of 1.5% sodium hypochlorite (mix 15 mL of 10% chlorine with 85 mL of water) to sterilize the seeds for 5 min. Invert the tube several times to ensure that the seeds and solution are well-mixed to sterilize the surface seeds completely.\nForce the seeds to the bottom of the tube by centrifugation for 30 s at 1,200 x g, remove the supernatant, and wash the seeds with sterile water four times at a bench to remove the residual sodium hypochlorite.\nAdd 4.4 g of Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal salt mixture and 10 g of sucrose to 1 L of ultrapure water. Stir the mixture to dissolve the salts and sucrose. Adjust the solution to pH 5.8 with 1 M KOH, add 3 g of gelling agent, such as Phytagel, to the MS-sucrose solution, and sterilize the solution at 121 °C for 15 min to make MS medium.\nPour 30 mL of the MS medium into a 12-cm culture dish to generate MS medium plates.",
    "Place the sterilized seeds on the MS plate. Transfer the plate to a growth chamber and keep the plate under long-day conditions (22 °C for 16 h in the light and 18 °C for 8 h in the dark) after seed stratification (3 days at 4 °C in the dark).\nAfter 8 days of growth, transfer the plants to soil (mix nutrient-rich soil and vermiculite at a 1:1 ratio) in a tray, cover the tray with a white, transparent lid for 5 days to avoid water loss, and leave a gap to avoid vitrification of the plants.\nTake the lid off the tray and cultivate the plants in a walk-in chamber under long-day conditions (see 1.1.5). Switch the light on at 6:00 am and off at 10:00 pm. After about 20 days of growth in the walk-in chamber, the plants will have flowered and produced siliques.\nMark the flower buds with a thread at the position of the seed stalks in the inflorescence at 8:00 pm (do not use the first to the third flower buds; the siliques generated from these flower buds usually develop a few aborted seeds, and this may alter the proportion of normal to abnormal ovules). Define the beginning of pollination of the ovule as when the marked bud opens to flower at 8:00 am the next morning.\nPreparation of Hoyer's solution\nAdd 24 g of chloral hydrate to a 50-mL tube and wrap the tube completely with aluminum foil (solutions of chloral hydrate are not stable under light).\nNext, add 9 mL of ultrapure water and 3 mL of glycerol to the above solution and shake the tube to dissolve the chloral hydrate. To make Hoyer's solution, let the tube stand overnight at room temperature to eliminate any bubbles.\nOvule separation and clearance",
    "Attach a piece of double-sided adhesive tape to a microscope glass slide. Place a silique grown for the desired number of days after pollination (DAP) on the slide with the pseudoseptum perpendicular to the surface; this will make it easy to split the carpels (Figures 1A and 1B).\nSplit the carpels on both sides of the pseudoseptum with a syringe needle and attach the two dissected carpels to the slide so that the ovules in the silique are visible under a stereoscope (Figures 1C and 1D).\nDispense 70 µL of Hoyer's solution onto the glass slide, and then moisten the tip of a pair of fine-tipped tweezers with Hoyer's solution by dipping. Using the stereoscope, move the ovules into the Hoyer's solution on the slide with the tweezers to clean the embryos. Apply a coverslip to the slide gently to avoid generating any bubbles.\nPut the finished slide into a box in a dark room for 2 - 12 h (the more mature an ovule is, the more time will be needed) at room temperature. Embryos at the 2/4-cell stage (1 - 2 DAP) can be observed microscopically after 2 h, while embryos between the octant and early globular stages (3 DAP) can be observed after 4 h. More mature embryos (4 - 8 DAP) can be observed after 12 h.\nExamine the cleared ovules using the DIC function of a microscope. Locate the embryos under a low-power field (10X) and then change to a high-power field (100X oil immersion lens) to observe the cellular pattern in the developed embryos.\nExamine the embryos at different developmental stages.\n2. Characterization of Embryo Patterning and Cell Identity via the Observation of Marker Protein Expression\nPreparation of plant materials",
    "Clone the promoter and coding sequence of the marker gene or hormone response element and then fuse it with a fluorescent protein (such as GFP); next, insert the construct into the binary vector (such as pCambia1300). Here, the auxin response element DR5 is presented as an example10.\nIntroduce the resulting DR5-GFP plasmid into the wild-type plants by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation11. Select the T1 plants using MS medium plates containing hygromycin (50 mg/mL of mother liquor, diluted 1:1,000). The transgenic plants will exhibit long roots and generate two rosette leaves after 8 days of growth under the conditions described in 1.1.5.\nTransfer the transgenic plants to soil and cultivate them as indicated in 1.1.6 and 1.1.7.\nCollect the T2 seeds from the independent T1 lines. Sow the seeds on MS-hygromycin plates, select the plants carrying one copy of the DR5-GFP insertion (the ratio of resistant plants to sensitive plants will be roughly 3:1), and transfer them to soil.\nCultivate the T2 plants as indicated in 1.1.6 and 1.1.7.\nCollect the T3 seeds from the T2 plants. Sow the seeds on MS-hygromycin plates, select the homozygous transgenic plants (all of the plants from a single line will exhibit hygromycin resistance), and transfer them to soil.\nMark the flower buds of the homozygous T3 plants as indicated in 1.1.8.\nGFP signal observation\nMix 3 mL of glycerol with 47 mL of ultrapure water to generate a 6% glycerol solution.\nAttach a piece of double-sided adhesive tape to a glass microscope slide and fix a silique as indicated in 1.3.1.\nSplit the carpels on both sides of the pseudoseptum with a syringe needle and attach the two dissected carpels to the slide under a stereoscope as indicated in 1.3.2.",
    "Dispense 30 µL of 6% glycerol onto the glass slide and place all of the ovules from the dissected carpels into the solution using fine-tipped tweezers. Place a coverslip on the slide gently.\nAs the seed coat and endosperm in each ovule can prevent the observation of GFP signals in the embryo, extract the embryo from the ovule. Tap the slide quickly and gently to extrude the embryo from the ovule (the more mature an ovule is, the less force should be applied to the slide).\nExamine the slide for GFP fluorescence using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Find the isolated embryos under a low-power field (10X) and record their location, then change to a high-power field (100X oil immersion lens) to observe DR5-GFP expression in the embryos by setting the excitation light source to 488 nm for detection of the GFP signal.\nDetect the GFP expression in the embryos to select the suitable T3 line for further analysis.\n3. Characterization of Embryo Pattern Formation in an Embryo-lethal Mutant via Ovule Clearance and Marker Protein Observation:  Naa10 as an Example\nEmbryo patterning in naa10 mutant plants\nPrepare the plant materials as indicated in 1.1.1-1.1.7.\nIdentify the naa10+/− plants by PCR using gene-specific primers5, and then mark the flower buds of the naa10+/− plants as indicated in 1.1.8.\nPerform ovule clearance and the microscopic examination of naa10+/− embryos as indicated in 1.2 and 1.3.\nMarker protein analysis using naa10 embryos\nObtain suitable DR5-GFP transgenic lines using the procedure outlined in 2.1 - 2.2.\nCross a homozygous DR5-GFP transgenic line with an naa10+/− plant to obtain naa10+/− plants that are homozygous for the GFP fluorescence marker at the F2 generation (identified by gene-specific PCR) to characterize naa10+/−5 and observe the GFP signal under a microscope using a homozygous DR5-GFP line.",
    "Mark the flower buds of naa10+/− plants that are homozygous for DR5-GFP as indicated in 2.1.7.\nSearch for the GFP signal in naa10 embryos that are homozygous for DR5-GFP as indicated in 2.2.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
