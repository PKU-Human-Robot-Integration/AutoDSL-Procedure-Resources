    "Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-prot-0001] describes how to biaxially test anisotropic, heterogeneous soft tissues and soft tissue analogs. The testing sequence is intended to induce multiple heterogeneous strain states. If conducted properly, this protocol will result in arm normal and shear forces as well as full-field displacement data. If desired, the data can be fitted using an inverse method to parameterize the sample's mechanical behavior according to a constitutive model or strain-energy function selected to accurately reflect the sample's behavior under the prescribed loading conditions. Parameterizations have been achieved using neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin, Fung exponential, and Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden strain-energy functions (Davis et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-bib-0016]; Katia Genovese et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-bib-0028]; Kroon & Holzapfel, 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-bib-0044]; Raghupathy & Barocas, 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-bib-0065]; Raghupathy, Witzenburg, Lake, Sander, & Barocas, 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-bib-0067]; Seshaiyer & Humphrey, 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-bib-0076]; Shih et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-bib-0077]; Witzenburg et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-bib-0091]; Zhao et al., 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-bib-0097], 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-bib-0098]).\nMaterials\nSpeckled and clamped cruciform-shaped soft tissue sample (see Support Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-prot-0003] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-prot-0004])\n0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; ∼6 L)\nDesktop computer (referenced biaxial system requires Intel i5-8500 processor and 16 GB RAM or better)\nBiaxial testing system, containing:\n               \nActuators [e.g., TestResources, E216SP Electro Dynamic Actuator; four (4)]\nLoad cells: one-degree-of-freedom (1DOF) load cells [e.g., TestResources, WF12S Miniature Fatigue Resistant Submersible IP65 Load Cells; two (2)] and 6DOF load cells [e.g., ATI, Nano 17 IP68 F/T Transducers; two (2)]\n1DOF software (e.g., TestResources, B8-16 TestBuilder and MTL32-2020)\n6DOF software (e.g., National Instruments LabVIEW 2019)\nControl software (e.g., TestResources, B8-16 TestBuilder)\nCamera (e.g., Imperx, PoE-C2400, 2464 × 2056 pixels, 5 megapixels, 36 fps), with lens (e.g., Computar, M3Z1228C-MP) and image capture software (e.g., Imperx, IpxPlayer)\nIsolation table (e.g., Thorlabs PFA51504 and B4860U)\nWatertight acrylic bath\nConnectors [3D printed or machined; four (4); STL Files 1 to 4 are provided in Supporting Information[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#support-information-section]]\nGripping system (see Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-prot-0004])\nPrior to biaxial testing",
    "1. At least 30 min before the desired testing time, turn on desktop computer, biaxial testing system, and camera. Confirm that isolation table, upon which the biaxial testing system is secured, is functional and ready for use.\nDifferent systems may require different warm-up periods. Consult the manufacturer.\n2. Ensure that there is enough space on hard drive for data files generated during testing.\nAt a resolution of ∼2400 pixels by ∼2000 pixels and a frame rate of 7 images per second, the testing protocol produces ∼50 GB of data. This size will vary based on the level of prescribed displacement and the displacement rate. We typically impose between 5% and 20% strain on each arm at a rate of ∼1%/s.\n3. Place empty watertight acrylic bath in the center of the actuators (see Fig. 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-fig-0001]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/bdbc068c-d13a-4c81-8762-ba48aa68addb/cpz1493-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\n(A) Prior to testing, an empty bath should be placed in the center of the biaxial testing system. To aid in image clarity, a colored background may be placed under the bath, and to prevent accidental leaks, an underpad/spill pad may be placed between the bath and the isolation table. (B) Attach the load cells to the actuators and turn them on ≥30 min prior to testing. The amount of time necessary to warm up the load cells will vary between manufacturers. (C) Positioning of the 6DOF load cells on adjacent arms enables measurement of in-plane shear forces throughout the test. The inability to measure shear forces is a limitation of many planar biaxial testing systems. (D) Grip connector attached to a 6DOF load cell.\n4. Attach load cells to their appropriate actuators (see Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-fig-0001] and 1C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-fig-0001]).\n5. Zero the load cells.",
    "Monitor the cells for ∼10 min to ensure that readings do not drift substantially (more than ∼0.2 N) from zero. If the readings drift outside of the load cells’ manufacturer's tolerance level, attempt to recalibrate them. If this does not resolve the issue, the load cells may be damaged and/or malfunctional and require service or replacement.\n6. While carefully monitoring the applied forces in the 1DOF and 6DOF control softwares, attach a connector to each load cell (see Fig. 1D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-fig-0001]).\nSoft tissues typically require cells with low load ranges. Therefore, careful handling is necessary to prevent overloading and load cell damage.\n7. Place speckled and clamped cruciform-shaped soft tissue sample in the gripping system and secure it to the biaxial testing system (see Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-prot-0004]).\n8. Slowly add 0.01 M PBS to bath.\nA layer of underpads and/or spill pads placed between the bath and the isolation table is useful for preventing leakage from reaching the table or actuators (see Fig. 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-fig-0001]).\n9. Focus camera on the surface of the sample and adjust exposure so that the speckle pattern is sharp and well defined and has sufficient contrast between light and dark regions.\nA black or white background placed immediately beneath the bath may aid in identifying image sample boundaries. A discussion of speckling methods is included in the Commentary.\n10. Add preload to tissue by incrementally moving the actuators outward in the control software.\nIn general, preload should be ≤10% of the maximum load achieved during testing (Debes & Fung, 1995[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-bib-0017]).\n11. Set position of each actuator to zero.\nOnce the position of the actuators has been set to zero, the resultant configuration of the sample will serve as the reference configuration for the following biaxial tests.\nConducting biaxial testing\n12. Begin imaging sample surface and recording forces.",
    "Adjust the camera settings so that the sample is in focus and will not be out of frame when maximally extended. To record images of the sample, navigate to the data acquisition tab in the imaging software, set the desired imaging frequency (i.e., 7 Hz), ensure that the files are being written to the appropriate folder with a consistent naming convention, and, once satisfied, begin recording images. To record forces, locate the data acquisition window in the software for the 1DOF and 6DOF load cells. Create a new file for the test with a consistent naming convention, ensure that the forces are being sampled and recorded at a desirable rate (i.e., 100 Hz), and then begin recording and conduct the planned test.\n13. Apply 10 equibiaxial stretch tests to sample at a rate of 1%/s for preconditioning such that the sample achieves a state of pseudoelasticity (Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-tbl-0001]).\nPreconditioning is commonly applied to tissue analogs and soft tissues such that they reach a state of pseudoelasticity characterized by repeatable force-displacement curves in response to the same loading conditions. The total amount of applied arm stretch, the rate of stretch, and the number of cycles necessary to achieve pseudoelasticity vary with sample type. In general, 10 equibiaxial stretches at the desired maximum strain level and a strain rate of 1%/s are sufficient to precondition tissue analogs and many soft tissues (Demer & Yin, 1983[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-bib-0018]; Fung, Fronek, & Patitucci, 1979[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-bib-0025]; Sacks, 2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-bib-0074]).\nTable 1.\n                Mechanical Tests Utilized in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-prot-0001]\ntable:\n﻿Test,Setup,Displacement ratioa[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-tbl1-note-0001_73]\nPreconditioning,imgsrc:/cms/asset/f1ebb6cb-5dac-45ff-a2f9-ac4de37b96c3/cpz1493-gra-0001.png,1:1:1:1\nEquibiaxial,imgsrc:/cms/asset/dd175015-e4b1-4425-817d-166e7e7e55f8/cpz1493-gra-0002.png,1:1:1:1\nTwo-arm pull,imgsrc:/cms/asset/14aa6009-7165-4290-bdbc-63f307673f2b/cpz1493-gra-0003.png,1:1:0:0 0:1:1:0 0:0:1:1 1:0:0:1\nSingle-arm pull,imgsrc:/cms/asset/92299751-b608-471e-a5cc-7c0e6405c467/cpz1493-gra-0004.png,1:0:0:0 0:1:0:0 0:0:1:0 0:0:0:1\nStrip biaxial,imgsrc:/cms/asset/c8cf1dbb-8501-4d2b-a73f-ff24c7cac999/cpz1493-gra-0005.png,0:1:0:1 1:0:1:0\nThree-arm pull,imgsrc:/cms/asset/f4fd722d-e065-4be7-95e0-d57aaf18dfa8/cpz1493-gra-0006.png,1:0.67:0:0.67 0.67:1:0.67:0 0:0.67:1:0.67 0.67:0:0.67:1\nEquibiaxial,imgsrc:/cms/asset/d5bb7617-054a-4818-b2fa-235bbe6843fc/cpz1493-gra-0007.png,1:1:1:1",
    "a Displacement ratios are given as right arm:top arm:left arm:bottom arm. A displacement ratio of 1 indicates the maximum prescribed displacement, 0 indicates no displacement, and values between 0 and 1 are a percentage of the maximum displacement (e.g., 0.67 is 67% of the maximum displacement).\n14. To maximize both shear and normal strains, conduct 15 different biaxial tests in which stretch is applied to different sample arms (Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-tbl-0001]).\nNote that for stiffer or softer samples, load cells with different ranges and tolerances than those specified may be required.\n15. Conduct one final equibiaxial stretch test (Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-tbl-0001]).\nResults from this test can be compared with earlier equibiaxial extensions to confirm that the sample maintained pseudoelasticity and sustained minimal damage during testing.\n16. Repeat steps 13 through 15 for additional imposed arm displacement levels if desired.\nFor new sample types, it is useful to conduct testing at increasing amounts and/or rates of arm displacement to avoid tearing the sample prematurely. An applied strain of 5%-10% is often a safe starting point. We utilize a strain rate of 1%/s (Sacks, 2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-bib-0074]).\nFollowing biaxial testing\n17. Drain PBS from the bath.\n18. Remove sample and gripping system from the tester while carefully monitoring the forces applied to the load cells in the 1DOF and 6DOF softwares.\n19. Remove connectors from each load cell.\n20. Remove and clean load cells.\nIf load cells are repeatedly exposed to PBS, it is important to rinse all surfaces in distilled water to avoid corrosion. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for load cell disassembly and cleaning.\n21. Dispose of sample appropriately.",
    "IMPORTANT NOTE: Follow local rules and regulations. Soft tissues may be considered hazardous waste. We deposit animal-derived soft tissue samples containing no pathogens into a plastic container and store it in a –20°C freezer. Once filled, we insert the container into a plastic bag, place the bag in a cardboard box, and seal the box. Boxes are retrieved and disposed of by the University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Environment, Health, and Safety.\n22. Sanitize laboratory surfaces and system components.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Again, follow local rules and regulations for soft tissue handling. Isopropyl alcohol and bleach are commonly used disinfectants. Sharps should be placed in an appropriate container and disposed of according to institutional protocols.\nData analysis\n23. Perform data analysis as desired.\nCompletion of Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-prot-0001] produces boundary forces for the prescribed extensions and raw images of the deforming sample's surface throughout the extensions. We create a 2D mesh of the sample's surface with quadrilateral elements using Abaqus. Then, we apply DIC to compute full-field displacement and strain (Raghupathy & Barocas, 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-bib-0066]). This DIC code is available at https://license.umn.edu/product/robust-image-correlation-based-strain-calculator-for-tissue-systems[href=https://license.umn.edu/product/robust-image-correlation-based-strain-calculator-for-tissue-systems]. Boundary forces and full-field displacements can then be used to construct load-displacement or stress-strain plots or input into a more advanced inverse mechanical analysis to identify material parameters.",
    "Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-fig-0002] shows arm forces throughout our biaxial testing protocol (Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-tbl-0001]) for TissueMend samples aligned along the horizontal axis of the biaxial testing machine and aligned at ∼45° from the test axis. TissueMend (TEI Biosciences and Stryker Corporation) is a surgical patch composed of non-denatured, non-crosslinked collagen derived from fetal bovine skin. This analog is a Class II FDA-approved material for soft tissue (e.g., rotator cuff, patellar, and Achilles tendon) repair surgeries. We normalized the shear forces to the maximum force for each extension to compare the samples quantitatively in Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-fig-0003]. Figure 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-fig-0004] depicts Green strain contours for these two samples at maximum extension for the strip biaxial tests. We computed the spatial averages and standard deviations of strain to compare the strain contours measured in the TissueMend samples quantitatively in Figure 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-fig-0005]. Together, these figures demonstrate the primary advantages of our protocol to produce and measure shear forces at a sample's boundary, pronounced heterogeneity in the strain fields, and large shear strains.

In the symmetric extensions, shear forces were small for the aligned sample (<23%) and sometimes larger for the offset sample (up to 44%). For the asymmetric extension, shear strains were larger for both samples; however, they were much larger for the offset sample.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c74a8fce-7e07-44be-aff7-f29aaa733073/cpz1493-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4",

For a TissueMend sample that had its stiffest direction aligned with the x-axis of our testing system (top), relatively homogeneous strain distributions can be seen, as can the shear strain contours that, for the most part, are nearly an order of magnitude smaller than their normal counterparts.

It is especially useful for samples with varying thicknesses or pronounced heterogeneity. The biaxial testing protocol discussed earlier (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-prot-0001]) produces 2D forces and full-field displacement data. In combination with these data, the full-field thicknesses obtained from this protocol enable quantification of sample stress.\nMaterials\nCruciform-shaped soft tissue sample (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-prot-0003])\nDesktop computer (referenced biaxial system requires Intel i5-8500, 16 GB RAM or better)\nLaser micrometer (e.g., Keyence, LJ-V7080), with software for laser micrometer visualization (e.g., LJ-Navigator 2 and LJ-Observer)\nMotorized stage (e.g., motor: Applied Motion, NEMA 23 STM23Q-2AN; ball screw and nut: McMaster-Carr, 6641K1 and 6641K21), with motor control software (e.g., Applied Motion, ST Configurator; Applied Motion, Q Programmer)\nFull-thickness measurement\n1.

To produce the image in Figure 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-fig-0007], the output file was read into MATLAB, the stage level was set to zero, noise was removed using a Gaussian filter, and the 3D geometry was visualized as a surface. Supporting Information[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#support-information-section], File 6, is the MATLAB code used to analyze the output file and produce surface plots of the sample's thickness.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d0f98f00-d0e4-4721-a06e-d11e64bd29d9/cpz1493-fig-0007-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 7\nExample of the thickness contours obtained from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-prot-0002]. In the central region of the hydrated TissueMend sample, the thickness was relatively uniform, at 0.995 ± 0.01 mm, suggesting homogeneity.",
    "Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-prot-0003] details how to prepare soft tissue and soft tissue analog samples for biaxial testing (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-prot-0001]). By definition, planar biaxial testing relies on the application of in-plane forces only, such that a state of plane stress can be assumed. For this assumption to be valid, samples must be thin. Because soft tissues are often naturally thin slabs, sheets, or membranes (Humphrey, 2002[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-bib-0037]), planar biaxial testing is a common testing modality for soft tissues and tissue analogs. In general, it is recommended that samples undergoing biaxial testing have a thickness at least one order of magnitude less than their overall length and width (Ventsel & Krauthammer, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-bib-0087]). Additionally, the ex vivo and planar nature of biaxial testing generally limits its application to quantification of passive tissue properties. Cruciform-shaped samples are commonly utilized in biaxial tests and lend themselves well to clamping (Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-prot-0004]). To quantify full-field deformations using DIC, texture is applied to the sample. Here, an approach utilizing an airbrush and India ink is detailed. It produces a fine, random texture that adheres to the sample surface without altering mechanics. After achieving a satisfactory sample shape and sufficient speckle pattern, the sample is ready for gripping and biaxial testing (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-prot-0001]).\nMaterials\nSoft tissue or soft tissue analog sample\n0.01 M PBS (e.g., Sigma-Aldrich, P3813-10PAK; pH 7.4, ∼50 ml)\nForceps (e.g., Fine Science Tools, 11053-10)\nCutting board\nBiopsy punches (e.g., Robbins Instruments, Disposable, 10 mm Diameter, RBP-100)\nRazor blades\n100 × 15–mm petri dishes (e.g., VWR, 25384-302)\nAirbrush (e.g., Master Airbrush G233) filled with India ink (e.g., Speedball Super Black India Ink 3378)\nAir supply (∼45 psi)\n1. Remove soft tissue or soft tissue analog sample from storage and place in 0.01 M PBS.",
    "We recommend immersing TissueMend samples in room-temperature PBS for ∼10 min for full hydration (see Fig. 8A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-fig-0008]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e1250d33-460f-4322-8759-0789bf7439ba/cpz1493-fig-0008-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 8\n(A) Place the TissueMend in a petri dish, cover with room-temperature PBS, and allow 10 min for the sample to become fully hydrated. (B) Using a biopsy punch, remove the corners of the rectangular analog to create a roughly cruciform-shaped sample. (C) Use a razor blade to trim away excess material, yielding the desired cruciform shape.\n2. Use forceps to move sample from PBS to the cutting board.\nTake note of the sample's orientation before and after cutting. This is critical for samples with prominent levels of anisotropy and/or heterogeneity.\n3. Use a biopsy punch and razor blade to trim sample into a cruciform shape.\nBiopsy punches create smooth, curved edges near the sample center (see Fig. 8B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-fig-0008]). Razor blades can then be used to trim any small remnants and form sample arms (see Fig. 8C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-fig-0008]). Care should be exercised such that the final sample is sufficiently thin. Note the final sample in Figure 8C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-fig-0008] is ∼20 mm in length and width, which is approximately 20 times the average thickness in Figure 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-fig-0007].\n4. Return cruciform-shaped sample to PBS to prevent dehydration prior to testing.\n5. Dispose of any trimmed remnants appropriately.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Follow local rules and regulations. Soft tissues may be considered hazardous waste. We deposit TissueMend remnants into a plastic container and store it in a –20°C freezer. Once filled, we insert the container into a plastic bag, place the bag in a cardboard box, and seal the box. Boxes are retrieved and disposed of by the University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Environment, Health, and Safety.",
    "6. Place sample in an empty 100 × 15–mm petri dish and speckle sample using an airbrush filled with India ink with an appropriate air supply.\nThe airbrush technique can be difficult to implement initially and requires practice. Hold the airbrush ∼6 in. away from the sample and spray lightly. Continue spraying the sample in bursts until the desired speckle pattern has been achieved. After speckling, allow ≥10 min for the dye to dry. This is important for maintaining the integrity of the speckle pattern once the sample is placed in PBS for mechanical testing. We use a spray nozzle that is 0.2 to 0.3 mm in diameter and attach the airbrush to an air supply at 30 to 50 psi.\nSupport Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-prot-0003] produces a cruciform-shaped sample with a high-quality speckle pattern that can be biaxially tested using Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-prot-0001]. Proper handling and careful trimming are necessary to create a sample with clean, smooth edges that reduce the likelihood of tearing during testing. The speckle patterns applied to samples should follow the general guidelines for speckling intended for strain tracking via DIC, which are outlined in more detail in the Background Information section of the Commentary.\n7. Sanitize instruments and laboratory surfaces.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Follow local rules and regulations for soft tissue. Isopropyl alcohol and bleach are common disinfectants. Sharps (i.e., razor blades and biopsy punches) should be placed in an appropriate container and disposed of according to institutional protocol.",
    "This protocol describes how a custom gripping system is used to attach a small soft tissue or soft tissue analog sample to a biaxial testing machine (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-prot-0001]). The specialized gripping system was designed such that a sample could be secured using a stereoscope, away from the testing machine. This gripping system utilizes clamps to secure the sample, rather than sutures, rakes, or hooks, to induce in-plane shear during biaxial testing.\nMaterials\nAll-purpose Krazy Glue (∼2 g)\nCruciform-shaped soft tissue sample (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-prot-0003])\nWater-resistant sandpaper (e.g., McMaster-Carr, 4660A14)\nCustom gripping system (3D printed or machined; STL Files 1 to 4 are provided in Supporting Information[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#support-information-section]), containing:\n               \nBottom clamps (4)\nBase (1)\nLarge thumb screws (e.g., McMaster-Carr, 99607A142)\nTop clamps (4)\nSmall socket head screws (e.g., McMaster-Carr, 92196A108)\nConnectors (4)\nSmall thumb screws (e.g., McMaster-Carr, 91185A257)\nHex-key Allen wrench set\n1. Prior to testing, cut small rectangular pieces of water-resistant sandpaper and glue them to bottom clamps between the threaded holes in the custom gripping system using all-purpose Krazy Glue.\nSandpaper helps eliminate slipping or pinching of the sample. Small dabs of Krazy Glue are sufficient for bonding the sandpaper to the grips. The glue should dry within 10 min but takes ∼24 hr to fully cure.\n2. Attach bottom clamps to the base with large thumb screws using a hex-key Allen wrench set (see Fig. 9A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-fig-0009]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d11a6791-a3d5-4a31-ae31-3e6f3915957a/cpz1493-fig-0009-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 9",
    "(A) The bottom clamps are attached to the base with large thumb screws. Strips of sandpaper can be seen on each of the bottom clamps. (B) Each of the speckled TissueMend sample's four arms are placed such that the sample rests on the strips of sandpaper glued to the bottom clamps. (C) Top clamps are attached to the bottom clamps using the small socket head screws. Although not visible, sandpaper strips are also glued to the surface of the top clamps that come into contact with the sample. (D) The clamped and secured sample is placed into the connectors attached to the biaxial testing machine. At this point, the base is still in place. (E) The gripping system without the supportive base. Each bottom clamp is secured to a connector using a small thumb screw, and then the base is removed.\n3. Place cruciform-shaped soft tissue sample on the bottom clamps and base. Take note of sample orientation.\nSee Figure 9B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-fig-0009]. Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-prot-0003] details the sample preparation.\n4. Secure top clamps on the sample using small socket head screws (see Fig. 9C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-fig-0009]).\n5. Place “T”-shaped ends of the bottom clamps into the connectors (see Fig. 9D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-fig-0009]).\nCarefully monitor the applied forces to avoid damaging the load cells. The connectors were attached to the biaxial testing system load cells in step 6 of Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-prot-0001].\n6. Secure each bottom clamp to a connector using a small thumb screw and then slowly remove base (see Fig. 9E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-fig-0009]).\nOnce the clamps are attached to the connectors and the base has been removed, the sample is secured in the biaxial testing machine (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-prot-0001], step 7). The gripping system now enables motion from the actuator to transfer to each sample arm during biaxial testing.",
    "Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-prot-0004] outlines our procedure for off-machine clamping of soft tissue or tissue analog samples intended for biaxial testing. The custom gripping system (Files 1 to 4 in the Supporting Information[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#support-information-section]) was designed to limit sample handling and reduce damage risk. It is simple to produce and implement and enables samples to be quickly and safely connected to the biaxial testing machine (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.493#cpz1493-prot-0001], step 7)."
