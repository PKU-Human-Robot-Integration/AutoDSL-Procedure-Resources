    "All animal experiments were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Experimental Research Center, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences and Zhejiang University.\n1. Solution Preparation\nPrepare all solutions as described in Table 1.\n2. Isolation of Left Ventricular (LV) Cardiomyocytes\nNOTE: LV cardiomyocytes are isolated enzymatically using a Langendroff perfusion system as previously described7,8,9,10,11.\nSet up the Langendroff perfusion system. Fill the perfusion system with Normal Tyrode (NT) solution, set the temperature at 36.5 °C, and eliminate any air bubbles in the tube.\nWeigh and anesthetize a Sprague-Dawley rat by intraperitoneal injection (ip) of chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg). Confirm the anesthetic status by evaluating tail or toe pinch response after 5 min.\nOpen the abdominal cavity under the xiphoid process with a surgical scissor, lift the xiphoid process, and open the chest with the scissor. Remove the pericardium, slightly lift the heart with curved forceps, identify the aortic arch, and cut off the heart by scissors from the root of the aorta.\nTransfer the heart to a 60-mm dish and wash it with NT solution. Hold the aorta with two micro-dissecting forceps, and mount it onto the Langendorff perfusion cannula, and then firmly ligate the aorta onto the cannula using surgical sutures.\n\tNOTE: A skilled operator can finish this process within 15 s.\nPerfuse the heart with 30 mL NT solution to recover circulation of the coronary arteries. Then, switch the perfusate to 30 mL Ca2+-free Tyrode solution (10 mM Taurine, 1 mg/mL BSA) to stop the heartbeat. Next, switch the perfusate to Collagenase A isolation solution (0.6 mg/mL) for enzyme digestion.\n\tNOTE: Use Collagenase A for experiments with diabetic rats, or Collagenase II for experiments without diabetic rats.",
    "After digestion for 20-25 min, quickly change the perfusion solution to the Ca2+-free Tyrode solution to stop further digestion. Then, hold the heart with forceps, cut it off from the cannula, and place the heart in a 35-mm dish containing KB solution (see Table 1).\nDissect the LV wall with scissors and forceps. Cut off the atrium, right ventricle and atrioventricular junction area. The remaining tissue is the LV; transfer it into a new 35-mm dish with KB solution. Mince the LV tissue into small pieces.\nGently pipette the pieces with a filtered plastic dropper, and re-suspend in 10 mL KB solution.\nFilter the cells with 150 µm aperture stainless steel filter, and transfer to a 15 mL centrifuge tube. Centrifuge at 150 x g for 30 s and discard the supernatant. Re-suspend the myocytes in 10 mL KB solution, free settle for 6 min, discard the supernatant, and re-suspend the pellet in 10 mL KB solution.\n\tNOTE: All steps were performed at 36 °C in solutions gassed with 100% O2.\n3. Calcium Reintroduction\nAfter settling for 20 min in KB solution, discard the supernatant, and re-suspend the myocytes with calcium reintroduction solution A (0.3 mM Ca2+, 4.5 mL Ca2+-free Tyrode solution, 1.5 mL NT solution) for 10 min.\nRepeat the above procedure with calcium reintroduction solution B (0.3 mM Ca2+, 3 mL Ca2+-free Tyrode solution, 3 mL NT solution).\nRepeat the above procedure with NT solution (1.2 mM Ca2+) to purify the available myocytes. Store the isolated LV myocytes in this solution and study them within 4-6 h.\n4. Set Up of Perfusion System\nConnect the inflow tube with the NT solution for chamber perfusion (Figure 1A).",
    "For needle perfusion of the target myocyte, connect the multi-barrel manifold tip (e.g., perfusion pencil, referred to as pencil henceforth), fixed in the micromanipulator, to the valve controlled perfusion system. Add NT solution and 10 mM caffeine solution to each column of the pencil (Figure 1A).\nEvacuate any air bubbles in the tubes to avoid air blockage.\nCount the drip number from the micron tip of the pencil for 10 s, and manually adjust the flow regulator to keep the flow speed at an approximate velocity of 3 drip/10 s.\n5. Measurements of Intracellular Ca2+ Transient and Sarcomere Shortening 7,8,9\nPipette 10 µL cell suspension on the slide, count cell numbers by a cell counter under the microscope, and calculate the density. Dilute myocytes to an approximate concentration of 50,000 cell/mL.\nAdd the Fura-2 acetoxymethyl (AM) stock (a calcium sensitive dye) into a 1 mL suspension of myocytes to bring the final concentration to 2 µM. Keep in the dark for 20 min at room temperature.\nCentrifuge at 150 g for 30 s, and re-suspend the cardiomyocytes with NT solution 2 times.\nTurn off the light and keep the cells in the dark. Place the myocytes in the perfusion chamber for 15 min. Then start the chamber perfusion (1.5 mL/min) with NT solution. Pace the myocytes with 1 Hz field stimulation using a stimulator (wave duration 4.0 ms, pulse amplitude 8.0 V) for 5 min.\nSelect a myocyte with good shape (rod shape, sharp edge, and clear cross striations) and stable stimulated twitch (no spontaneous contraction) under the 10x microscopic objective lens. Next, change the microscopic magnification to 40x, and rotate the CCD camera orientation to keep the myocyte in a horizontal position.\nFrame the single myocyte by adjusting the cell framing adapter. Ensure that the background is clear.",
    "Expose the myocytes to the light emitted by a Xenon lamp, with 340 or 380 nm wavelength excitation filters, and image the myocytes through a 40x objective. Detect fluorescence signal at 510 nm. In the meantime, note the sarcomere length changes of the myocytes and record using the soft-edge module simultaneously.\nRecord fluorescence by a dual-excitation fluorescence photomultiplier system. Run the recording program for the calcium imaging system, click \"File/new File\" to create a new recording file, and click the \"start\" button to synchronously record fluorescence and sarcomere length.\n6. Assessment of SR Ca2+ Reserve and Diastolic Ca2+ Removal Function 7,8,9\nInterlink the \"Aux Out\" port in the stimulator with the \"Analog In\" port on the valve control system (e.g., valve commander, see Table of Materials) by a BNC cable (to synchronize the TTL signal).\nPreset a program for switching the perfusion valves automatically as previously described8,9; Detailed steps for operation are listed as following.\n\t\nPreset the parameters in the valve control software as per Table 2, and click the \"Download\" button to download the sequence loaded in the program. Click the \"Trigger\" button to enable the trigger function.\n\t\tNOTE: The valve control system can execute the sequence after receiving TTL signal.\nPreset the stimulator to sequence mode, and set the parameters as per Table 3.\nSet the stimulator at \"S1 step\" to pace the LV myocytes at 1 Hz. Start the needle perfusion at the speed of 1.5 mL/min with NT solution.\n\tNOTE: Because the speed of the needle stream is faster than chamber perfusion, the light refraction of the needle stream is different from the light refraction of chamber perfusion. The difference of light refraction indicates the range of effective needle perfusion, which surrounds the target myocyte.",
    "Select a target myocyte under the low power microscopic view (in the sequence of downstream to upstream), and make sure it can be reached by the micro tip of the pencil. Change the microscope magnification to 400x. Rotate the CCD camera orientation to keep the myocyte in the horizontal position. Adjust the rectangular aperture under the cell framing adapter to a suitable window that fills with the myocytes. Ensure that there is minimal background; do not allow other myocytes or dead cell debris in this window.\nAdjust the position of the pencil fixed on the micromanipulator, and carefully place the micro tip at the distance of the radius of vision field to the target myocyte under 400x microscope magnification.\nAdjust the needle stream range to mostly cover the target myocyte and make sure that the myocyte cannot be swept away by the needle flow.\nAfter 60 s basic pacing, roll the stimulator cursor to the \"D2 step\".\n\tNOTE: The rest of protocol will be executed automatically by the stimulator and valve control system. Based on the above setting, the protocol could be executed automatically as in Figure 2A, 1 Hz basic pacing with NT solution for 60 s. Then pause pacing and delay for 2 s, rapidly switch to 10 mM caffeine perfusion for 15 s (to functionally release Ca2+ storage in the SR), and then switch back to NT solution.\nAt the end of the recording, detect the background fluorescence for individual myocytes. Click the \"pause\" button to pause the file recording, move the microscopic view to a nearby blank area. Click the \"record\" button to resume recording for seconds, and record numerical 340 and 380 nm intensity values for background correction.",
    "Open the \"Operation/Constant\" dialog box and fill the values into the \"background\" form, respectively; the software can correct Fura 2 ratio values by subtracting the background.\n7. Data Analysis 9\nFor measurements of calcium transients and sarcomere shortening at the basic pacing stage, average the twitch pulses, and then analyze dynamic parameters, such as calcium transients, the time constant of calcium transient decay (Tau-1 Hz), using the software automatically.\n\tNOTE: If the software does not fit the decay segment well, export the decline trace for manual mono-exponential curve fitting.\nFor caffeine-induced calcium pulses, select only the pulse with a steep wave for analysis of calcium removal function. Exclude cells with signal disturbance, abnormal pulse, or those that flowed away midway.\nMeasure the amplitude of the caffeine-induced calcium pulse (Ca-caffeine, an index of SRCa2+ reserve).\nObtain the decay time constant of caffeine-induced calcium pulse (Tau-caffeine) by mono-exponential curve fitting (10 s duration) manually from software (Figure 2C).\nSubscription Required.
