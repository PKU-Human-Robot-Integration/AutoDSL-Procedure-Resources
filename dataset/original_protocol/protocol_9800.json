    "1. Synthesis of pBAE polymer with end oligopeptides (OM-pBAE)\nPolymerization of C6-pBAE\n\t\nAdd 5-amino-1-pentanol (38 mmol; MW = 103.16 Da) 1-hexylamine (38 mmol; MW = 101.19 Da) into a round-bottom glass flask (100 mL). Then, add 1,4-butanediol diacrylate (82 mmol; MW = 198.22 Da).\nPre-heat the silicone oil bath at 90 °C, place the round-bottom flask into the oil bath and stir the mixture with the aid of a magnetic stir bar overnight (~18 h). Then, take the product from the round-bottom flask and place it in the freezer at -20 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The product is in the form of a sticky powder and is taken out from the flask with the help of a spatula. It is essential to validate the structure of the obtained polymer through 1H-NMR. NMR spectra were recorded in a 400 MHz instrument (see Table of Materials) using chloroform-d and D2O as solvents. Around 10 mg of each poly(β-amino ester) were taken and dissolved in 1 mL of the deuterated solvent.\nReaction with peptides to obtain OM-pBAE\n\t\nAdd 25 mL of 0.1 M HCl to selected peptides, e.g., peptide Cys-His-His-His with Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, 200 mg), into a previously weighed 50 mL centrifuge tube that can stand freeze-drying and manually stir overnight to obtain a clear solution.\nFreeze the solution at -80 °C for 1 h and freeze-dry the resulting peptide hydrochloride.\n\t\tNOTE: Check whether the final weight corresponds to the theoretical value.\nMake a solution of C6-pBAE (0.031 mmol) in dimethyl sulfoxide. Also, make a solution of the peptide hydrochloride (0.078 mmol) in dimethyl sulfoxide.\nMix the two solutions in a screw cap tube and screw on the cap. Stir the mixture solution in a water bath with a controlled temperature of 25 °C for 20 h with a magnetic stir bar.",
    "Add the mixture to 7:3 (v/v) diethyl ether/acetone. Centrifuge the resulting suspension at 25,000 x g at 4 °C to remove the solvent. Next, wash the solid with 7:3 (v/v) diethyl ether/acetone twice. Then, dry the product under a vacuum (<0.2 atm).\nMake a solution of 100 mg/mL of the product in dimethyl sulfoxide. The resulting product is named C6-peptide-pBAE. It is essential to validate the structure of the obtained polymer through 1H-NMR to confirm the disappearance of the olefin signals associated with terminal acrylates. If not used, the polymer can be frozen at -20 °C.\n2. Polyplexes formation\nNOTE: All the procedures should be performed inside a conditioned room to maintain a constant temperature.\nThaw the polymers C6-peptide-pBAE and vortex the solution.\nPipette the polymer mix up and down and prepare a solution of 12.5 mM (V1) in sodium acetate (NaAc). Then, vortex the mixture and wait for 10 min.\nPrepare the mRNA at 0.5 mg/mL and mix by pipetting (V2).\n\tNOTE: It is crucial to avoid vortexing the mRNA.\nVortex the polymer mixture at the final concentration to achieve a homogeneous solution between the polymer stock in DMSO and the acetate buffer.\n\tNOTE: The final polymer concentration depends on the N/P (nitrogen to phosphate groups) ratio selected. The N/P ratio depends on each specific mRNA to be used. For eGFP encapsulation, for example, a 25:1 ratio was used, as previously reported14.\nMix the genetic material solution and C6-peptidepBAE solution (25x of the mRNA concentration) in a ratio of 1:1 (Vi = V1 + V2).\n\tNOTE: C6-peptide-pBAE is loaded in a microcentrifuge tube where the mRNA is added by pipetting up and down for mixing. Once prepared, the polyplex, the nucleic acid, and C6-peptide-pBAE concentrations are half diluted.",
    "Incubate at 25 °C for 30 min in a thermoblock. Precipitate with 1:2 RNase free water by adding the sample to a pre-loaded microcentrifuge tube with water.\nInclude the excipients. Add the same volume as the mixture of mRNA and pBAE (Vi) in HEPES 20 mM and sucrose 4% by pipetting up and down. At this point, the sample has been diluted 3x.\n3. Polyplexes lyophilization\nInstantaneously, freeze at -80 °C freezer of the previous polyplex solution for 1 h.\nPerform the primary drying by following the steps: (1) 1 h at -60 °C and 0.001 hPa; (2) 1 h at -40 °C and 0.0001 hPa; (3) 4 h at -20 °C and 0.0001 hPa; (4) 12 h at 5 °C and 0.0001 hPa.\nStore at -20 °C immediately to avoid rehydration until use.\n4. Polyplex resuspension\nNOTE: This protocol describes the process used to reconstruct the lyophilized C6-peptide-pBAE nanoparticles for their further use either for characterization, in vitro, or in vivo analysis.\nTake the lyophilized nanoparticles from -20 °C just at the moment of use and rapidly add the corresponding amount of depyrogenated (DEPC) water to redisperse the solid to achieve the desired concentration.\n\tNOTE: The volume will be the same as the initial volume of the nanoparticles if the same concentration is envisaged, but it will be indicated for each experiment.\nPipette gently until total resuspension, accompanying the liquid with the pipette.\n\tNOTE: Assure that no material remains on the wall of the vial.\nOnce dissolved, pipette up and down vigorously, avoiding bubbles.\n\tNOTE: The sample should have a transparent to translucent aspect, which is more evident at higher concentrations\nStore the samples on ice or at 4 °C for a maximum period of 24 h once reconstituted. Avoid freezing.\n5. Polyplex characterization\nDynamic light scattering",
    "NOTE: Hydrodynamic diameter (nm), polydispersity index (PDI), and surface charge of nanoparticles were measured at 25 °C, 633 nm laser wavelength, and 173° signal detector, using a Zeta potential analyzer (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nHydrodynamic diameter (nm)\n\t\t\nPrepare the nanoparticles mixing mRNA and pBAE thoroughly by pipetting the gene material to the polymer fraction to a final concentration of mRNA of 0.25 mg/mL as previously described above (step 2).\nPre-rinse a microcuvette with filtered dilution media to completely clean it from impurities. Then, fill the cuvette with at least 50 µL of the sample solution and cap it. Next, introduce the sample inside the DLS instrument, ensure that the cell is correctly inserted.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The dilution media is filtered using a 0.22 µm syringe filter.\nOpen the Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) file created and introduce the desired Sample Name. Select Size Measurement.\n\t\t\tNOTE: All the parameters to create an SOP for size measurements are provided in Table 1.\nRun the particle size measurement using DLS by clicking on Play.\n\t\t\tNOTE: After the triple beep sounds, the analysis is complete.\nSelect the results corresponding to the sample on the measurement sheet to obtain the average particle size, average PDI, standard deviation, and graphics. Once done, remove the cell from DLS equipment.\nRemove the sample, keep it for zeta-potential analysis, and clean and rinse the cell with deionized water. Finally, dry the cleaned cuvette under a compressed air gas stream.\nSurface charge (mV)\n\t\t\nPrepare the nanoparticles mixing mRNA and pBAE thoroughly by pipetting the gene material to the polymer fraction to a final concentration of mRNA of 0.25 mg/mL as previously described above (step 2, Polyplex formation). Next, freeze and dry the solution.",
    "NOTE: In this case, for the measurement of surface charge, the freeze-drying of the sample is strongly recommended before performing the measures to redisperse the sample in the appropriate buffer, simulating body conditions of pH and electrolyte concentration.\nResuspend the lyophilized sample using water. Dilute the sample 1/10 in water (final concentration 0.025 mg/mL).\nPre-rinse a disposable folded capillary cell (zeta potential cuvette) with filtered dilution media to completely clean it from impurities. Then, fill the cuvette with diluted nanoparticles, using a 1 mL syringe, and cap both sides of the fillers.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The nanoparticle dispersion has to fill the volume available in the cuvette (~1 mL), taking special attention to the bubble's formation, which could perturb measures.\nIntroduce the sample inside DLS; ensure that the cell is correctly inserted.\nOpen the SOP file created for zeta potential analysis and introduce the desired Sample Name. Select Zeta-Potential Measurement.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Parameters to create an SOP for zeta potential measurements are given in Table 2.\nRun zeta-potential measurement using DLS by clicking on Play.\n\t\t\tNOTE: After the triple beep sound, the analysis is complete.\nSelect the results corresponding to the sample on the measurement sheet to obtain the average zeta-potential, standard deviation, and graphics. Once done, remove the cell from the DLS equipment.\nRemove the sample and keep it if it is necessary. Next, clean and rinse the cuvette cell with deionized water, followed by ethanol and water again. Finally, dry the cleaned cuvette under a compressed air gas stream.\n\t\t\tNOTE: To analyze the data, use the recommended software.\nNanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA)\n\tNOTE: Hydrodynamic diameter (nm) and concentration of nanoparticles were measured at 25 °C, 488 nm laser wavelength using a Nanoparticle Tracking Analyzer (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nNTA and sample preparation",
    "Switch on the computer and the equipment. First, check whether all the components are plugged in correctly. Next, open the recommended software. The software will check whether all the accessories are correctly connected.\nConnect the Top plate, here, the O-ring cell, into the laser module.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Do not overscrew this part.\nFirst load the chamber with buffer and/or deionized water with a 1 mL syringe. Repeat the procedure at least two times. Avoid introducing bubbles in the chamber.\nPrepare the sample by diluting 1/1000 in deionized water from the concentration used in DLS size measurement. Prepare at least 1 mL and load it into a 1 mL syringe, avoiding introducing bubbles.\nLoad the samples into the chamber using a syringe. Then, plug the laser module into the NTA big chamber.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Big chamber denotes the space where the chamber is placed for the measurement.\nImage optimization\n\t\t\nFirst, in the Hardware, check whether the Camera and the proper laser are selected.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Here, there is only one camera and the Blue Laser 488 nm.\nStart with the camera level at 0 and press Start Camera on the Capture window.\n\t\t\tNOTE: At this point, adjust the following parameters. Beam position (it can be moved up and down on the screen). Camera Level: avoid oversaturated pixels. Focus (lateral wheel): try to focus as better as possible. It is better to have particles with a halo instead of unfocused particles. Concentration: Adjust the concentration to have between 10 to 100 particles per field.\nVideo recording\n\t\t\nIn the software, go to the Measurement Selection- SOP window (down left) and select Standard Measurement.",
    "NOTE: Program to perform three measures of 30 s each (to enable the software to perform mean and standard deviation calculations). Provide a name and a folder path (on Base filename) to save the records of the sample. When the SOP parameters are correctly set up, press Create and Run Script. Once the first replicate is measured, the program will ask to add a new sample. Then, another fraction of the sample must be introduced in the chamber by pushing the syringe's plunger. Finally, repeat a third time to analyze the third replicate.\nVideo processing\n\t\t\nReadjust the Screen Gain and Detection Threshold once the three measures are finished to analyze the measured particles. At this moment, around 100 particles should appear in each frame to perform the analysis (high red crosses and low blue crosses are expected).\nExport the results in a pdf file after the analysis is completed. In addition, it is possible to export as videos and excel files.\nCleaning the NTA\n\t\tNOTE: Close all the opened measurements before studying the following sample; since the generated files are enormous and depending on the computer, it isn't easy to maintain more than one open.\n\t\t\nClean the NTA chamber by repeatedly flushing water before performing the subsequent measurement until no particles are observed; subsequently, flush the buffer used (PBS) to continue with the measures.\nFlush air inside the chamber and dry it with microscopic grade paper once the last measurement of the day is completed.\nCharacterize the size and shape by Transmission Electronic Microscopy (TEM). Prepare the samples. 30 µL of the final volume is enough for TEM characterization.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Both fresh and lyophilized - after resuspension- nanoparticles can be measured.",
    "Drop 10 µL of sample on a carbon-coated copper grid. Let it dry for 10 min. Remove the excess liquid, if necessary, by softly tapping on filter paper.\nDrop 10 µL of uranyl acetate (2% w/v) solution for negative staining. Let it dry for 1 min. Remove the liquid excess, if necessary, by softly tapping on filter paper.\nIntroduce the sample in the microscope and scan (voltage operation 80 kV).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Appropriate software can be used for further analysis of the images.\nEncapsulation efficiency\n\t\nSample preparation\n\t\t\nPrepare the nanoparticles at the desired concentration and freeze and dry them. Then, resuspend the nanoparticles and dilute them at a final concentration of 6 µg/mL.\nPrepare 1x TE buffer from the 20x stock solution.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Vt (Total volume) = (number of samples x 100 µL x 4) (number of samples x 290 µL) + 2 mL.\nPrepare TE buffer with 3 µg/µL of Heparin from the stock of 100 µg/µL.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Vt = Number of samples x 50 µL x 2.\nPrepare the standards\nPrepare an RNA standard ranging from 0.2 µg/mL to 0.025 µg/mL in 1x Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer (Table S1A).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Use mRNA in the RNA standard in case that differs from the Ribosomal RNA.\nPrepare RNA:pBAE standard with Heparin (Table S1B). Prepare Heparin standard (Table S1C).\nPrepare a 96-well plate as follows.\n\t\t\t\nLoad 295 µL of TE buffer in the first lane of a 96-well plate (as many wells as samples to analyze). Then, load 50 µL of 1x TE buffer into lanes B and C (duplicates for each sample).\nLoad 50 µL of 1x TBE buffer with 3 µg/µL of Heparin into lanes D and E (duplicates for each sample). Next, load 100 µL of each standard in lanes F, G, and H (duplicates for each standard).",
    "Load 5 µL of each sample in lane A (concentration in each well is 0.1 µg/mL). Mix properly by pipetting and load 50 µL of each sample on the four wells below (two of them containing 50 µL of buffer 1x TE and two more containing 1x TE buffer with 3 µg/µL of Heparin).\nIncubate the sample for 30 min at 37 °C. Prepare RiboGreen reagent as per the manufacturer's protocol (see Table of Materials) in 1x TE buffer.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Dilute 1:200 and vortex. Protect from light. Vt = Number of full wells x 100 µL.\nLoad 100 µL of RiboGreen solution into each well. Detect fluorescence using the microplate reader with an excitation wavelength of 500 nm and an emission wavelength of 525 nm.\nResults analysis\n\t\t\nPrepare the three calibration curves\n\t\t\t​NOTE: First, Ribosomal RNA standard. Interpolate in this calibration curve the samples that do not contain Heparin. Second, mRNA:pBAE with Heparin. Interpolate in this calibration curve the sample that has Heparin. Third, Heparin. Used to assure the working concentration is in the linear range.\nCalculate encapsulation efficiency (EE%) as follows:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62889/62889eq01.jpg\n6. In vitro characterization\nFluorescence microscopy for qualitative assessment\n\t\nPlace the 96-well plate onto the microscope after 24 h of transfection. Start visualizing cells with the 10x objective.\n\t\tNOTE: HeLa cells are used in this case. Cells are localized using the transmission mode (bright field), and the focus must be adjusted at this time.\n\t\t\nFirst, apply a white balance to reference the software about the background of the samples. Then, acquire an image to overlay it with the fluorescence image during the analysis.\nChange the microscope mode to reflection mode (fluorescence) and move the filter wheel to the blue laser (488 nm) to visualize eGFP.",
    "NOTE: At this point, the Exposure time and Gain must be adjusted. Gain must be adjusted in values between 3 and 5 to avoid artifacts and excess on background signal. The adjustment of the exposure time depends on the transfection efficiency (from ms to 1 s).\nAcquire images for all the conditions or wells employing the same exposure time to compare all the samples.\nFlow cytometry (FC) for quantitative assessment\n\t\nUse a multichannel pipette to prepare the 96-well plate for the flow cytometry experiment.\n\t\tNOTE: When working with semi-adherent cells, such as in the JAWSII cell line, recover all the media volume and store it into another 96-well plate. Do not aspire to this media since it might contain a significant number of transfected cells.\nClean the cells (HeLa cells are used here) with 100 µL/well of 1x PBS and aspire it. Next, add 25 µL/well of trypsin and incubate it at 37 °C for 5 min.\nOnce the cells are detached, add previously recovered media to stop the trypsin action and fix the cells, adding 31.25 µL/well of formalin 10% for 20 min (final concentration 2.5%).\n\t\tNOTE: At this point, it is crucial to visualize the state of the cells by microscopy to ensure the detachment of the cells. It is highly recommended to pipette up and down several times to help the cells detach and avoid their agglomeration. This will produce a reliable result.\nTurn on the flow cytometer and the software. In the software, set up the proper conditions for the experiment (type of plate, sample volume, and other parameters such as shaking, rinsing between samples.",
    "NOTE: For step 6.2.5, the flow rate should be 120 µL/min. Mix one cycle every 1 min and rinse one cycle every one well. Mixing is essential to maintain the cells dispersed in the media and permit a better analysis of individual cells. In addition, rinsing is necessary to clean the microfluidics of the cytometer between samples. Finally, check whether there are enough buffers and whether all components are correctly connected.\nSet up the appropriate parameters to quantify the percentage of positively transfected cells.\n\t\t\nFirst, view the flow data on (Forward scattered light) FSC versus SCC (Side scattered light) scatter plot to distinguish the cells from the debris. Then, another scatter plot comparing the amplitude (FSC-A) versus height (FSC-H) is plotted to gate and discriminate individual cells.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: The untreated population allows to gate the populations corresponding to positively transfected cells. Then, quantification of the positively transfected cells is performed on the proper channel on a histogram plot. Therefore, the positively transfected cells must be represented as a continuum of events on the histogram.\n7. In vitro functionality tests: capacity to activate model immune cells by using ovalbumin (OVA) as antigenic model mRNA\nPlate 10,000 cells/well (JAWSII cells are used here) in a 96-well plate the day before transfection.\n\tNOTE: Plate as many wells as required to have triplicates for each condition. Let the cells attach to the plate at least for 12 h (an overnight incubation is recommended).\nPrepare pBAEs NPs as described in the NOTE below to transfect 0.6 µg mRNA per well.",
    "NOTE: As a positive control, transfect the cells using a transfection reagent. Here, we used 0.1 µg mRNA per well and 0.25 µL of the transfection reagent per well. mRNA codifying for OVA was purchased (see Table of Materials). It is polyadenylated, modified with 5-methoxyuridine, and optimized for mammalian systems, and is protected through an end-capping with Cap1 structure, a proprietary method from the supplier.\nIncubate the 96-well plate for 24 h in a dry air incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n\tNOTE: After this time, do not aspire the media since it might contain a certain number of cells. Recover the cells and save them in another well or plate.\nWash the cells remaining on the well with 25 µL of 1x PBS. Next, aspire it and add 25 µL of trypsin and incubate the plate for 5 min at 37 °C to detach the cells. Stop the trypsin reaction by adding the previously recovered media onto the correspondent well.\nCentrifuge the plate at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Aspire the media. Add 50 µL/well of a 1x PBS and 2.5% of formalin. Incubate it at 4 °C for 20 min to fix cells.\nRepeat steps 7.5 and 7.5.1. Then, add 50 µL/well of 1x PBS and 3% BSA (Blocking buffer) and incubate for 30 min at 4 °C. Again, repeat steps 7.5 and 7.5.1, and then add 50 µL/well of the primary antibody (mouse α-OVA) in 1x PBS and 3% BSA and incubate for 30 min at 4 °C.\nRepeat steps 7.5 and 7.5.1, and then wash the cells with 50 µL/well of 1x PBS. Aspire media, and then add secondary antibodies solution (α-mouse-AlexaFluor488/PerCP and Cy5.5-CD11b/APC-CD86) in 1x PBS and 3% BSA. Incubate it for 1 h at 4 °C.",
    "Centrifuge the plate at 400 x g for 5 min. Then, wash the cells with 50 µL/well of 1x PBS. Next, centrifuge (400 x g for 5 min), aspire, and then resuspend the cells in 100 µL/well of 1x PBS and 2.5% Formalin.\nAnalyze it by flow cytometry, as described above (step 6.2).\nSubscription Required.
