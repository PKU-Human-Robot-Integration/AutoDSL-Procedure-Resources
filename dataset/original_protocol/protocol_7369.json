    "Primers design  Primers should be designed according to the GoldenBraid syntax, including BsmBI (Esp3I) restriction sites followed by pUPD2 and GoldenBraid fusion sites in both extremities (Figure 1A).In case the sequence from the gene or DNA fragment of interest presents BsmBI (Esp31) or BsaI restriction sites, the fragment should be divided into sub-fragments, inserting synonymous mutations in the primers to silence the restriction site (Patron et al., 2015).Alternatively, the target gene can be amplified using primers with the BsaI sites instead of BsmBI sites, with the forward overhang GGGGTCTCAAATG and reverse overhang GGGGTCTCAAAGC (Figure 1B). The PCR products can be used directly in the Golden Gate reaction without the pUPD2 cloning step.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4576/bioprotoc-12-24-4576-g001.jpg Figure 1. Primer design to clone  attL  sequences and the target gene into GoldenBraid bricks, according to Vazquez-Vilar et al. (2017).  Primers are designed to use the standard (A) or alternative (B) BiG protocol. Green box: BsmBI recognition site with the pUPD2 fusion sites (underlined); Orange box: fusion site to follow the Golden Gate assembly syntax; Purple box: specific sequence to amplify  attL  or target gene; Blue box: BsaI recognition site; RC: reverse complement. GoldenBraid bricks assembly into pUPD2 vector  Individually amplify  attL1  and  attL2  fragments, as well as the target gene, by touchdown PCR using a high-fidelity DNA polymerase such as the platinum SuperFi II polymerase.Use a pENTRTM/D-TOPOTM  vector as a DNA template to amplify  attL1  and  attL2  sequences.Perform the PCR reaction in 50 μL of final volume according to the enzyme manufacturer's instructions.",
    "Touchdown PCR steps: 98 °C for 1 min, followed by nine cycles of 98 °C for 30 s, proper melting temperature for 30 s, and 65 °C for 1 min, starting with 66 °C of melting temperature and decreasing 1 °C each cycle, plus 30 cycles of 98 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 30 s, and 65 °C for 1 min, and ending with 65 °C for 3 min.Add loading dye to the PCR samples to the final concentration of 1× and perform the electrophoresis using the total PCR reaction volume and the 1 Kb plus DNA ladder in 1.5% agarose with 0.002% of SYBRTM  Safe DNA gel stain.Confirm the PCR amplification and the amplicon size, 150 pb, by visualizing in the Blue-Light transilluminator.Cut the DNA band corresponding to  attLs  or the target gene fragments and purify it from the agarose using the gel extraction kit. Note: Purification can be performed directly from the PRC products.  Quantify DNA concentration using the spectrophotometer.Clone the  attL1, attL2, and target gene fragments into the GoldenBraid acceptor vector (e.g., pUPD2) by an assembly reaction using BsmBI restriction enzyme and T4 DNA ligase (Figure 2).Set up the GoldenBraid reactions according to Recipe 1 (see Recipes).Thermal cycler steps: 37 °C for 10 min followed by 30 cycles of 37 °C for 3 min and 25 °C for 4 min, ending with 37 °C for 10 min and 80 °C for 5 min.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4576/bioprotoc-12-24-4576-g002.jpg Figure 2. Schematic GoldenBraid bricks assembly.    attL  s and target gene individual PCR fragments (top) flanked by the BsmBI (dark green box), pUPD2 fusion sites (light green box), and Golden Gate fusion sites (light blue box) along with the pUPD2 vector (middle), were submitted to the GoldenBraid reaction to obtain the first bricks (bottom). All fusion sites are in the sense direction.",
    "Transform  E. coli  DH10α chemically competent cells with the total assembling reaction volume by heat shock.Plate the cells using plating beads on LB (see Recipe 2) with chloramphenicol (25 μL/mL), IPTG (1 mM), and X-gal (200 μg/mL) and incubate cell plates at 37 °C overnight.Select from two to five isolated white colonies and pick them to perform PCR colony using GoTaq green master mix to confirm the assembly construction.Perform PCR colony using specific primers for each cloned DNA sequence.Inoculate a single positive colony in liquid LB medium with chloramphenicol (25 μL/mL) and incubate shaking at 37 °C overnight.Extract the plasmid DNA from the liquid culture using plasmid Miniprep kit and quantify DNA concentration with the spectrophotometer. Golden Gate assembly  Perform the Golden Gate (GG) assembly with  attL1-pUPD2,  attL2-pUPD2, target gene-pUPD2, and a GG acceptor vector (e.g., pICSL86900OD) using BsaI restriction enzyme and T4 DNA ligase (Figure 3).Set up the Golden Gate reactions according to Recipe 3 (see Recipes).Thermal cycler steps: 37 °C for 10 min followed by 30 cycles of 37 °C for 3 min and 25 °C for 4 min, ending with 37 °C for 10 min and 80 °C for 5 min.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4576/bioprotoc-12-24-4576-g003.jpg Figure 3. Schematic Golden Gate assembly to produce the BiG entry vector.  Individual bricks harboring  attL  s and the target gene were submitted to the Golden Gate reaction with the pICSL86900OD vector.Transform  E. coli  DH10α chemically competent cells with the total assembly reaction volume and plate on selective LB medium with the proper antibiotic as described previously.Select from two to five isolated white colonies by performing PCR colony. Then, one colony can be used to cultivate cells in a liquid LB medium following the plasmidial DNA extraction.Perform PCR colony using specific primers for each cloned DNA sequence.",
    "LR reaction  Perform LR reaction using the GoldenGate entry vector containing the gene of interest flanked by  attL  sites and the Gateway expression vector of choice.To reduce costs, we performed the LR reaction with half the volume indicated by the manufacturer’s protocol in an overnight incubation at room temperature (see Recipe 4).Transform  E. coli  DH10α chemically competent cells with the LR reaction and plate in selective LB medium with the proper antibiotic as described previously.Plasmidial DNA extraction from positive colonies selected by PCR colony can be used in further experiments."
