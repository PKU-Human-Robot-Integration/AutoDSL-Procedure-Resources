    "The protocol described below is executed under guidance and approval of Western University's Animal Care and Use Committee. All experiments are performed in compliance with all relevant guidelines, regulation and regulatory agencies.\n1. Cell Culture\nPreparation of Complete Medium\nUsing a Class II biological safety cabinet, prepare complete medium by aseptically adding fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin streptomycin (P/S) to a 500 ml bottle of RPMI medium. Mix gently by swirling. The final concentration of each supplement is 10% FBS and 1% P/S (v/v). For example, supplement 500 ml of media with 56 ml FBS and 6 ml P/S.\nPlace complete medium in a water bath at 37 °C.\nThawing and Propagating Cells\nRetrieve PANC-1 GFP cells from liquid nitrogen. Thaw the vial by gentle agitation in a water bath at 37 °C.\n\t\tNote: Thawing should be rapid (approximately 2 - 3 min).\nLabel T-75 flasks to be used with (a) cell-line name, (b) passage number, (c) date, and (d) researcher's initials.\nWipe the vial with 70% ethanol and transfer vial to a biosafety cabinet.\nTo propagate the cells, add 9.0 ml of complete medium to a 15 ml conical tube. Using a 1.0 ml pipette, carefully transfer the cell suspension and suspend it in 9 ml of complete medium.\nCentrifuge at 125 x g for 8 min at RT. Transfer the conical vial to a biosafety cabinet and aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.\nSuspend the pellet in 10 ml of fresh complete medium by gently pipetting the suspension up and down.\nCount the cells with a hemocytometer and plate them in T-75 flasks at a density of 2.1 x 106 cells/flask. Place flask in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.",
    "Monitor the cells daily by eye and under the microscope. If fluid renewal is needed, aseptically aspirate the complete growth medium from the flask and discard. Add equal volume of fresh complete medium.\nPropagating Cells\nAseptically remove medium from the flask. Add 5 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate buffer saline (DPBS) to rinse cells and discard.\nDetach the cells from the flask by adding 3 ml of 0.25% trypsin. Incubate flask containing trypsin at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 5 to 10 min.\nObserve cells under the microscope (10X magnification) and ensure they are round and dislodged.\nNeutralize trypsin by adding an equal volume of complete medium and break up clumps by gently pipetting up and down.\nCount the cells using a hemocytometer and transfer the appropriate cell suspension volume to new flasks at the cell density mentioned in 1.2.7; add enough fresh media so the final volume is 10 ml per flask.\nCell Suspension Preparation for Injection\n\tNote: Since the basement membrane matrix, high concentration, solidifies at RT, keep all materials on ice. Place all sterile pipette tips and vials in the freezer overnight, and keep on ice while working on the suspension.\n\t\nKeep a bottle of RPMI media without any additives on ice. Thaw the basement membrane matrix, high concentration, by following manufacturer's instructions. Preferably, aliquot into smaller vials to avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles 10.\nAspirate media from all flasks, and rinse with 5 ml of DPBS. Repeat all steps on the previous section up to step 1.3.4.\nTransfer contents to a 15 ml conical tube and centrifuge at 125 x g for 8 min at RT. Transfer conical vial to biosafety cabinet and re-suspend pellet using 10 ml of DPBS.\nGently pipette the suspension up and down to break up the pellet. Count cells using a hemocytometer.",
    "Centrifuge again as outlined in step 1.4.3. Aspirate supernatant and depending on the number of cells, add appropriate diluent to yield 3 x 106 cells into a volume of 50 µl. The diluent will be a mixture of serum free media and high concentration basement matrix membrane in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio.\nVortex the suspension gently and keep on ice at all times. The suspension is now ready for injection.\nSurgical Implantation\n\tNote: Ensure that all surgical materials and instruments are sterile. Practice aseptic techniques at all times.\n\t\nPlace a heating pad on the table and cover with a sterile drape. Set up the anesthesia machine and ensure all the supplies are within arm's reach.\nPlace the animal's snout into the anesthesia mask and set up the anesthesia to 1 L/min of oxygen and 2.5% isoflurane.\nGently scrub the flank of the animal with iodine, and rinse with 70% ethanol. Repeat three times.\nConfirm the animal is fully anesthetized by pinching the hind paw. The animal is fully anesthetized and ready for surgery if no response is observed. However, if the animal flinches, ensure there is sufficient anesthesia in the vaporizer and allow the animal more time to go completely under anesthesia.\nLoad approximately 200 µl of the cell suspension into a 1.0 ml TB syringe with an 18 G needle (previously cooled). Replace the needle with a 27 G needle and return to ice until ready to use.\nLocate the general area of the spleen (left upper quadrant of the abdomen) and using forceps pinch the skin on top of that region. Using surgical scissors make an incision of approximately 1.0 cm to create a pocket. Similarly, pinch the smooth muscle on top of the spleen and cut through in order to access the peritoneal cavity.",
    "Gently grab the caudal end of the spleen and pull it out of the body. The pancreas will be attached to the spleen. Spread the pancreas using a wet sterile Q-tip and locate the tail of the pancreas.\nDeliver the 50 µl injection into the tail of pancreas, leave the needle inside for 10 sec and slowly rotate the needle out of the pancreas. A successful implantation will look like a superficial bubble without any leaks.\nReturn the pancreas and spleen to the peritoneal cavity. First enclose the muscle and then enclose the skin separately. Use a 6-0 suture or staple to close the incision. To avoid pain in the animal, administer ketoprofen subcutaneously (SC) (5 mg/kg) over 24 hr. Alternatively, administer buprenorphine sc (0.05 - 0.1 mg/kg) every 12 hr over a 36 hr period.  \nRecover the animal from anesthesia and return it to its cage. Also monitor for pain. Animals must be provided with pain relief at the time of (or even prior to — pre-emptive) surgery. Additional pain relief must be provided to animals that experience pain according to IACCUC-protocol or as prescribed by the attending veterinarian or designee.\nIn vivo Imaging\n\tNote: Image capture was performed using a commercial imaging system equipped with a dark chamber and the appropriate filters for GFP imaging. Image acquisition was accomplished using a CCD camera and an optical system consisting of interchangeable excitation/emission lenses (excitation: 455 - 495 nm; emission: 513 - 557 nm). Bright field images were captured without a filter at 1 x 1 binning for each time point. Excitation of GFP utilized a xenon multispectral light source. Animals were maintained under anesthesia throughout the imaging process by connecting the anesthesia machine to a gas anesthesia manifold integrated into the dark chamber of the imaging system.",
    "Anesthetize the animal as outlined in 1.5.2. An anesthesia mask is in the interior of the commercial imaging system's dark chamber in order to keep the animal under anesthesia during the imaging process.\nSet up the correct excitation and emission filters.\nBegin by obtaining an initial image using white light only. Keep the same position of the animal throughout the imaging session and switch to GFP filters to take a second image.\nFor best results superimpose both images. Analyze the image for fluorescent area and intensity.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
