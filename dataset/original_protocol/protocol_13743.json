    "NOTE: The following is a general protocol used to quantify membrane ruffle formation in RAW 264.7 macrophages using SEM microscopy. Optimization may be required for different cell types.\n1. Cell line and cell culture\nGrow RAW 264.7 macrophages in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) heat-inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 100 IU/mL of penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Replace growth media every other day.\nWhen cells become 80% confluent, wash the plate two times using sterile PBS.\nDetach cells by adding 1,000 µL of 0.5% trypsin-EDTA and incubate the cell culture plate for 3-5 min in a humidified incubator at 37 °C.\nExamine the plate under a light microscope to confirm cell dissociation. Add 10 mL of growth media containing 10% FBS to inactivate trypsin.\nCollect the cell suspension in a 50 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 400 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Gently resuspend cells in the complete cell culture medium and determine the cell count and viability using Trypan Blue (0.4%) staining.\n\tNOTE: The recommended minimum cell viability for this experiment is >90%.\nPlace sterile glass coverslips in wells of a 24-well plate using autoclaved forceps. Seed cells onto coverslips at a density of 1 x 106 cells/mL and incubate the plate overnight in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nChange media of each well with fresh 500 µL complete media before treatment. Pretreat macrophages with vehicle (DMSO or other solvents used to dissolve EIPA) or the macropinocytosis inhibitor 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-Amiloride (EIPA, 25 µM21) for 30 min.\nTreat cells with vehicle and stimulators of macropinocytosis to promote membrane ruffling: phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 1 µM, 30 min21) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF, 100 ng/mL, 30 min3).",
    "NOTE: Alternative inhibitors [e.g., latrunculin A (1 µM, 30 min) or cytochalasin D (1 µM, 30 min)] and stimulators [e.g., epidermal growth factor (EGF, 100 ng/mL, 10 min) or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF, 100 ng/mL, 15 min)] of macropinocytosis can be also used to characterize macropinocytosis in macrophages and other cell types16,27,28,29. Cells may require overnight serum starvation prior to the treatment with physiological stimulators of macropinocytosis. It is important to note that the most effective concentrations and incubation times will have to be determined to stimulate macropinocytosis in other cell types.\n2. SEM fixation\nAfter the treatment, aspirate the media from wells and wash coverslips with ice-cold PBS twice.\nFix cells (4% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by overnight incubation in the fixative at 4 °C.\nGently wash and incubate coverslips with 500 µL of following reagents without disturbing the cell monolayer.\n\t\nWash once in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate and incubate for 15 min.\nWash twice with dH2O with 10 min incubation in each wash.\nWash twice with 25% ethanol with 10 min incubation in each wash.\nWash twice with 50% ethanol with 10 min incubation in each wash.\nWash twice with 75% ethanol with 10 min incubation in each wash.\nWash twice with 80% ethanol with 10 min incubation in each wash.\nWash twice with 95% ethanol with 10 min incubation in each wash.\nWash twice with 100% ethanol. Perform 10 min of incubation in each wash.\n\t\tNOTE: Changing/replacing of reagents should be done fast to prevent air drying of cells. Coverslips can be left in 100% ethanol for several days at 4 °C. For long-term storage, add additional 100% ethanol and cover wells with parafilm to prevent air drying of the sample.\n3. Critical point drying",
    "Place coverslips in a Critical Point Dryer and cover with 100% ethanol. Press the Power button and open the CO2 tank.\nPress the Cool button for approximately 30 s until the temperature decreases to 0 °C. Press the Fill button until a bubble appears in the chamber window.\nPress the Purge button until the smell of ethanol from the purge exhaust disappears. Press the Cool button again until the temperature decreases to 0 °C.\nRepress the Fill and Purge buttons to turn them off and close the CO2 tank. Repress the Cool button to turn it off and press the Heat button.\nSet the temperature at 42 °C and pressure at 1,200 psi. Once the pressure and temperature stabilize, press the Bleed button to allow the pressure to decrease slowly.\nOnce the chamber pressure reaches 150 psi, press the Vent button and wait until the pressure decreases to 0 psi. Turn off the critical point dryer and remove the coverslips.\nMount coverslips on SEM aluminum specimen mounts using Carbon Adhesive tabs and subject to sputter coating using gold/palladium in a sputter coater.\nTurn on the Power button and wait until the vacuum reaches 30 mTorr. Flush the chamber to remove humidity and air by turning off the gas switch and turning the Fine gas valve counterclockwise.\nOnce the vacuum increases to 200 mTorr turn off the gas switch and wait until the vacuum reaches 30 mTorr. Repeat this step 3 times.\nPush the Timer button and adjust the Voltage knob until the gauge reads 10 mA. Remove coated coverslips from the chamber.\n\tNOTE: Follow manufacturer's instruction to perform critical point drying and sputter coating of the sample.\n4. Imaging and quantification\nInsert sample coverslips into the chamber of a scanning electron microscope. Close the door and press the Evac button.",
    "Open the SEM operation software. Set the accelerating voltage to 15 kv and the working distance to 10 mm.\nPress the Coordinates button and move around the controller until the cells appear in the center of the observation screen. Set the magnification to 3,500x and image the sample by clicking the Photo button.\n\tNOTE: Use a higher level of magnification (8,500x to 16,000x) to show the plasma membrane at greater details.\nTake images from at least 10 random locations on the coverslips, making sure that each microscopic field contains multiple cells. Save images as .tif files.\nFrom the images, locate membrane ruffles, defined as protruding blanket-like folds of the plasma membrane, with a size greater than 500 nm (Figure 1). Count the number of ruffles per cell.\n\tNOTE: C-shaped ruffles were identified as curved membrane protrusions that did not fuse on their lateral ends [(Figure 1 (M-CSF treatment) and Figure 2B]. Fused circular membrane ruffles, prior to their closure, were identified as macropinocytotic cups (Figure 2C).\nNormalize the number of membrane ruffles to the total number of cells in the microscopic field evaluated. Repeat this analysis for the samples from each group.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
