    "Animal care and procedures were in accordance with Finnish national legislation for the use of laboratory animals, the European Convention for the protection of vertebrate animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes (ETS 123), and the EU Directive 86/609/EEC.\n1. Fabrication of minireservoirs for cultivation of mouse embryonic kidneys and renal organoids on chicken CAM and setting up xenotransplantation experiments\nUse transwell cell culture inserts designed for 6 well or 12 well plates.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the particular experiment, large or small minireservoirs can be used. It is best to use small minireservoirs for xenografting up to eight embryonic kidneys or when several minireservoirs will be placed on same chicken embryo (e.g., experiment and control samples on same chicken CAM).\nCut down the sides of the inserts using a rotary multitool with a circular saw blade or a hand saw to create a 2 mm high plastic ring with a permeable membrane attached to it.\nPolish the edges of these minireservoirs with a scalpel or a sharp knife.\nSterilize the minireservoirs in 70% ethanol for at least 1 h.\nWash the minireservoirs in autoclaved double-distilled water and let them dry in a laminar hood.\nRinse the minireservoirs in PBS and culture medium (high-glucose DMEM/10% FBS/1% penicillin-streptomycin).\nPlace the reservoir in a Petri dish, on top of a drop (600 µL/400 µL) of culture medium with the membrane facing up.\nArrange dissected ex vivo embryonic kidneys or renal organoids evenly on the membrane with the help of a pipette or a glass capillary tube. Avoid leaving a lot of liquid around the kidneys.\nLet the samples attach to the membrane for 2–24 h in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.",
    "NOTE: Up to eight E11.5 embryonic mouse kidneys or kidney organoids can be arranged on the small insert. The large insert is recommended if either bigger pieces of embryonic tissue will be used for xenotransplant or a cell-hydrogel mixture on a larger area of the CAM.\nTake 8-day-old ex ovo cultured embryonic chickens prepared according to previously published methods out of the cell culture incubator12,13.\nTransfer the minireservoirs to the CAM so that the grafts are facing the CAM, and the membrane overlays them. Place the minireservoirs in the periphery of the CAM, so that they are not covering the chicken embryo.\n\tNOTE: When using the smaller minireservoirs fabricated from transwell inserts for 12 well plates, up to three minireservoirs can be placed on one CAM.\nAdd 500 µL (6 well insert) or 300 µL (12 well insert) of culture medium to the minireservoirs.\nCultivate the samples on chicken CAM for a maximum of 9 days. Replace the culture medium in the minireservoirs daily.\n\tNOTE: Vascularization of the samples can be observed as soon as 24–48 h after transplantation.\n2. Fabrication of custom-designed plates and setting up FiZD cultures\nDrill 20 mm diameter holes in the bottom of a 6 well plate.\n\tNOTE: For FiZD experiments, use 6 well plates with a 16 mm well depth (specified in Table of Materials).\nPolish the rims of the holes (especially on the upper side) using an electric drill with a countersink drill bit, a scalpel, or a sharp knife.\nSterilize the plates in 70% ethanol for at least 1 h.\nWash the plates in autoclaved double-distilled water and let them dry in sterile conditions.\nThoroughly wash 22 mm x 22 mm glass coverslips with 70% ethanol or clean them according to the published protocol by Saarela et al.11.",
    "Glue the coverslips to the upper side of the holes in 6 well plates using a nontoxic tissue glue. Apply glue around the hole and gently place the coverslip to cover it. Let the glue dry.\nInspect the plates under a stereomicroscope and remove excess dried glue from the surface of the coverslips if needed.\n\tNOTE: Check that there is no glue above the coverslip to ensure even compression of the samples.\nMix polystyrene beads (70 µm particle size) with an equal volume of hydrogel. A volume of 50–100 µL per well is sufficient.\n\tNOTE: Keep the mixture of hydrogel and polystyrene beads on ice.\nPlace a transwell insert under a dissecting microscope with the membrane up.\nArrange the samples (e.g., ex vivo embryonic kidneys or renal organoids) evenly on the membrane.\nAdd the hydrogel/polystyrene bead mixture next to the samples carefully to avoid damage to fragile tissues.\nFlip the transwell insert so that the membrane with the samples assembled on it is facing down.\nGently place the insert into a well of the modified 6 well plate and gently press it down so the samples are compressed to the level of the beads.\n\tNOTE: Follow the progress of the compression using a microscope.\nKeep the insert slightly pressed to the well with one hand and fix it to the plate by melting plastic with a soldering iron at three points at the periphery of the insert.\nWhen the insert is fixed to the plate, add 2 mL of culture medium (DMEM/10% FBS/1% penicillin-streptomycin) to the well and continue assembling the remaining wells in the plate in the same way.\nTransfer the finished plate to an on-stage incubator of an inverted microscope for time-lapse imaging.\nPerform time-lapse imaging of the samples using appropriate experimental settings.",
    "NOTE: Changing the culture medium in the wells of the plate during time-lapse experiments is not required but can be easily done through the holes on the sides of the insert.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
