    "1. Exosome Isolation\nNote: The isolation of exosomes from plasma samples, was performed with a commercial kit, according to manufacturer's protocol and by adding RNAse treatment: (all these steps must be performed with personal and environment protective equipments and following specific legal procedure for manipulation of biological samples).\nTake 1 ml of plasma of each sample, stored at -80 °C, and place it on ice.\nCentrifuge the sample at 2,000 × g for 20 min at RT; this passage is mandatory in order to remove cells and debris.\nTransfer the supernatant containing the clean plasma to a new 1.5 ml tube.\nCentrifuge the new tube at 10,000 × g for 20 min at RT.\nTransfer the supernatant containing the clean plasma to a new 1.5 ml tube.\nAdd 100 ng/ml of RNAse to the supernatant and incubate the tube at 37 °C for 10 min in order to degrade circulating RNAs.\nTransfer all the treated plasma to a new 2 ml tube and add 0.5 volume of 1x PBS.\nVortex the sample in order to mix the solutions.\nAdd 0.05 volumes of Proteinase K solution (enclose in the kit) to the sample.\nVortex the sample and then incubate at 37 °C for 10 min.\nAdd 0.2 volume of exosome precipitation buffer to the sample and mix the solutions by inversion.\nIncubate the sample at 2 °C to 8 °C for 30 min and then centrifuge the sample at 10,000 × g for 5 min at RT.\nAspirate and discard the supernatant. The pellet contains the isolated exosomes.\nAdd selected buffer to the exosome pellet in order to resuspend the exosomes. The selection of the buffer depends on the downstream analysis planned, in this case:\n\t\nAdd 100 µl of 1x PBS in order to perform TEM analysis.",
    "Add 346.5 µl of specific lysis buffer for RNA extraction (from commercial kit) (CAUTION: chemical hazard).\nAdd 100 µl of lysis buffer for protein extraction (Tris-HCl 50 mM pH 7.6 - NaCl 300 mM - Triton X-100 0.5% - PMSF 1 mM - Leupeptin/Aprotinin 10 µg/ml) in order to perform Western Blotting analysis. (CAUTION: chemical hazards).\nStore the resuspended exosomes at −20 °C.\n2. Exosome Characterization by Western Blot Analysis\nNote: In order to characterize the isolated nanovesicles, western blotting with antibodies against ALIX and TSG101 (well-known exosomal markers) is recommended.\nAfter resuspension of the exosome pellet in Lysis buffer, place it on ice for 1 hr in order to dissolve the exosomal membrane.\nCentrifuge the lysate at 12,000 g for 10 min and transfer the supernatant to a new tube without disturbing the pellet.\nQuantify the total exosomal protein content by Bradford Assay or other methods and load 50 µg of proteins per well in a Tris/Glycine SDS - 8% Polyacrylamide gel. (CAUTION: chemical hazards).\nSeparate the proteins (and an appropriate molecular weight marker) in 8% SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis with running buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS) for 1 hr and 30 min at 120 V. (CAUTION: chemical hazards).\nTransfer the protein to a nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting with 4 °C cold transfer buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% methanol) for 1 hr at constant 50 V. (CAUTION: chemical hazards).\nBlock the membrane for 1 hr in slow agitation with 5% non-fat dry Milk in 1x TBS -Tween 0.1%.\nWash the membrane 4 times for 5 min in fast agitation with 1x TBS - Tween 0.1%.",
    "Add the primary antibodies against ALIX and TSG101 (one per membrane) in appropriate buffer (accordingly to the antibody datasheet from the manufacturer) and incubate the membrane O/N in slow agitation.\nWash the membrane 5 times for 5 min in fast agitation with 1x TBS - Tween 0.1% in order to remove excessive antibody.\nAdd the appropriate secondary antibody in appropriate buffer (accordingly to the antibody datasheet from the manufacturer) and incubate the membrane for 1 hr in slow agitation.\nWash the membrane 5 times for 5 min in fast agitation with 1x TBS - Tween 0.1% in order to remove excessive antibody.\nDetect the selected protein by chemiluminescence analysis 11.\n3. Exosome Characterization by TEM Analysis\nNote: In order to visualize the isolated exosomes, TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy) analysis was performed.\nPlace  ~10 µg (previously quantified by Bradford assay) of sample of intact exosomes resuspended in 1x PBS on a parafilm and put on the sample drop a formvar carbon coated nickel grid for 1 hr.\nWash the grid 3 times by positioning it on three 40 µl 1x PBS drops.\nWash the grid 5 times by positioning it on five 30 µl ultrapure water drops.\nFix the sample by adding a drop of 2.5% glutaraldehyde (CAUTION: chemical hazard) for 10 min.\nWash the grid 3 times by positioning it on three 40 µl 1x PBS drops.\nAdd a drop of 2% uranyl acetate (CAUTION: chemical hazards) and put the grid on top of it for 15 min in order to contrast the sample.\nEmbed the sample on a drop of 0.13% methylcellulose (CAUTION: chemical hazards) and 0.4% uranyl acetate and incubate the grid on top of the drop for 10 min.",
    "Gently remove liquid excess with an absorbing paper and dry the grid for 5 min with the coated side up.\nExamine the grid by transmission electron microscope12.\n4. Exosomal RNA Extraction and Quantification\nNote: We decided to perform the total RNA extraction from exosomal samples using a commercial kit, according to manufacturer's protocol: (CAUTION: chemical hazards, review the manufacturer's protocol and guidelines).\nAfter resuspension of the exosome pellet in 346.5 µl of lysis buffer, add 3.5 µl of β-Mercaptoethanol (CAUTION: chemical hazards) and vortex vigorously; this passage is mandatory in order to destroy the lipid membranes.\nAdd the lysate to the washing column in a collection tube and centrifuge at 11,000 × g for 1 min. After centrifugation, discard the column and transfer the filtrate to a new 1.5 ml RNase-free tube.\nAdd 350 µl of 70% Ethanol (CAUTION: chemical hazards) and mix by vortexing for 5 sec.\nLoad the lysate in the resolving column and centrifuge for 30 sec at 8,000 × g. After centrifugation, discard the flowthrough and transfer the column to a new collection tube.\nLoad 350 µl of desalting buffer and centrifuge at 11,000 × g for 1 min. After centrifugation, discard the flowthrough and return the column into the same collection tube.\nAdd 95 µl of DNase I reaction mix (10 µl of reconstituted DNase I + 90 µl of DNase buffer, for each sample) on the silica membrane of the column and incubate at RT for 15 min at RT. (CAUTION: chemical hazard)\nAdd 200 µl of washing buffer (CAUTION: chemical hazard) to the column and centrifuge at 11,000 × g for 1 min. Place the column into a new collection tube.",
    "Add 600 µl of washing buffer to the column and centrifuge at 11,000 × g for 1 min. After centrifugation, discard flowthrough and place the column into the same collection tube.\nAdd 250 µl of washing buffer to the column and centrifuge at 11,000 × g for 2 min. Place the column into a 1.5 ml RNAse-free tube.\nElute the RNA in 40 µl of RNAse-free water and centrifuge at 11,000 × g for 1 min, in order to have a high RNA concentration in this small volume.\nImmediately place eluted RNA on ice to prevent potential degradation or store at -80 °C.\nQuantify the RNA content. Note: Here, the RNA quantization was performed by using 1 µl of sample through spectrophotometer.\n5. Retrotrascription of Exosomal miRNAs\nNote: Due to the described limited quantity of miRNAs content in exosomes, it was decided to perform the reverse transcription of selected miRNAs through a commercial kit using an individual assay for each miRNA, according to manufacturer's protocol. For each sample, 8 miRNAs correlated to NSCLC status were selected (miR-30b; miR-30c; miR-103; miR-122; miR-195; miR-203; miR-221; miR-222; and miR-1228-3p as endogenous control).\nPrepare the Reverse transcription master mix (RT mix). For each reaction prepare 7 µl of RT mix, as described in Table 1 (click here to download)[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53900/Table1.xlsx]. (CAUTION: chemical hazard)\n\tNote: In this experiment, 9 different RT mix were prepared for each sample.\nMix gently and store the RT mix on ice. Add 7 µl of RT mix per reaction tube.\nAdd 5 µl of sample RNA (10 µg of total RNA) per reaction tube and mix gently.\nAdd 3 µl of the 5x reverse transcription primers (CAUTION: chemical hazard) from each assay set into the corresponding reaction tube.\nMix slowly, close the tube and incubate on ice for 5 min.",
