N’ denotes reverse complement of N in forward primer.\nPhosphorylate the oligonucleotides as indicated below and incubate them at 37°C for 1 hour.\n5 μL 10 × T4 DNA Ligase buffer (TAKARA) 1 μL Spacer-F (100 μM) 1 μL Spacer-R (100 μM) 1 μL T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (TAKARA) 42 μL ddH2O\nNote: Gently mix all the reagents and collect them by a quick spin. The order of addition of the reagents can be random.\nAdd 0.5 μL of 5 M NaCl into the phosphorylated product. Incubate the reaction solution at 95 °C for 5 min and then slowly cool it down to room temperature (20-30°C) using a thermocycler, during the process of which the temperature decreases by 1°C per 10s.\nAlternatives: You can anneal the oligonucleotides using hot water instead of a thermocycler. Incubate the tube containing the aforementioned reaction solution in a hot water bath of boiling water for 5 min. Then get the tube out of the water bath and let the solution slowly cool down to room temperature (20-30°C).\nDilute the annealed oligonucleotides 20 folds with ddH2O.

    "Critical: To achieve a high editing efficiency, we suggest using the freshly-prepared pCasAb-harboring A. baumannii electrocompetent cells for editing. According to our experience, the genome editing efficiency mediated by the frozen pCasAb-harboring electrocompetent cells is less than 10% of the fresh cells.\nThe Two-Plasmid pCasAb/pSGAb-Mediated Genome Editing\nTiming: 1–2 days\nAdd approximately 200 ng spacer-introduced pSGAb-km plasmid and 3 μL of 100 μM ssDNA or 300 ng dsDNA donor repair template into a tube of freshly prepared pCasAb-harboring A. baumannii electrocompetent cells, and then gently transfer the mixture into an ice-cold 2 mm electroporation cuvette (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).

The spacer-introduced pSGAb-km plasmid without the insertion of a donor DNA can be used as negative transformation control. ssDNA donor template can be used for gene deletion and point mutation. dsDNA donor template can be used for point mutation and gene insertion. Long homologous template (>200 bp each) can improve the efficiency of gene insertion. The deletion length flanking Cas9 cleavage sites should be similar and no more than 1 kb each.\nPerform the electroporation using a Gene Pulser XcellTM Electroporation System with the following parameters: 2.5 kV, 200Ω and 25 μF.\nNote: Adjust the appropriate parameters when using different electroporation systems.\nAfter being pulsed, immediately add 1 mL of prechilled antibiotic-free LB broth into the cuvette to resuspend the cells.",

The transformation of the spacer-free pSGAb plasmid can produce thousands of colonies (positive control). The transformation of the spacer-introduced pSGAb without a donor DNA can only produce less than 20 colonies (negative control).\nRandomly pick several colonies to verify the success of the genome editing by colony PCR.

In general, the genome editing efficiency is more than fifty percent.\nCritical: The locations of the two primers used for verification should be outside of the donor template in the genomic DNA.\nPerform DNA sequencing using one of the specific primers employed above (for example, oxyR-seq-F or oxyR-seq-R) to confirm the desired genome editing.\nCure Both the pCasAb-apr and pSGAb-km Plasmids\nTiming: 2–3 days\nInoculate the desired A. baumannii mutant in 5 mL of antibiotic-free LB broth and shake it at 250 rpm for 14-16 hours at 37°C.\nStreak a fraction of culture onto an LB agar plate supplemented with 5% w/v sucrose, and incubate it at 37°C until colonies are visible (approximately 16 hours).",
