  "procedures": [
    "This protocol was developed to characterize seeds before the start of any cycle of seed increase. It allows for the characterization of the original phenotypes of seeds from heterogeneous materials, if the cycle to be carried out is the first (development of SSD lines from heterogeneous accessions), and for obtaining data on the seed morphology of each SSD line for each subsequent cycle of seed multiplication. Such data are important not only to obtain a characterization of seeds from different genetic resources but also to detect human and/or technical errors that can eventually occur during the chain of the selfing cycles.\nNOTE: Record the seed traits as detailed below at the beginning of each primary seed increase cycle. The phenotypic characterization must be performed before using the seeds in any (and all) selfing cycles.\nMaterials\nSeeds\nRuler\nAnalytical balance\nSpreadsheet software\n1.

    "The aim of SEED bean imaging is to document the beans during their respective propagation steps in regard to the following traits:\n         \nVisual quality control of the propagation result;\nReference images for shape, color, and size;\nPicture material for presenting the SSD line in various media;\nBasis for automated image analysis.\nA comprehensive discussion on the digitization of collections based on Nelson, Paul, Riccardi, and Mast (2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.133#cpz1133-bib-0054]) is given in de la Hidalga, van Walsun, Rosin, Sun, and Wijers (2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.133#cpz1133-bib-0019]). Accordingly, the following requirements should be fulfilled as the best-practice standard.\nNOTE: Image capture should be done using a defined process under comparable conditions, and any institution and/or research group involved in seed increase of shared SSD lines should implement a standardized system to take images of seeds.\nImportant considerations for photography are listed below.\n         \nTo obtain good separation of the beans from the background, it is advisable to place them on a background of a color not present in skins of the beans. Light gray is ideal here for a neutral picture impression; if this is too close to the color of the beans, a black or white background can be used. The background should be flat and should not have any structural pattern.\nInclude a color chart in the photographs for quality control and postprocessing. This allows the lighting, white balance, and color accuracy of the image to be verified.\nInclude a scale bar to allow measurement of the dimensions of the objects.\nMaterials\nUniform background (see above)\nColor chart: e.g., ColorGauge Micro Target (Image Science Associates) or ColorChecker Classic Mini or Nano (X-Rite)\nScale bar\nPhoto lighting studio made of a lighting box (40 × 40 cm) with brightness-adjustable LED lamps (allowing gradual adjustment of light level)",

Select at least five beans to be photographed. Selected bean seeds should be typical of the respective line in terms of color and size, although any variability should also be captured.\n2. Place the bean seeds, color chart, and scale bar on the background. Arrange the beans so that they are separated from each other, and position one bean near the rule, at scale position zero of the scale. Be sure to leave enough space for the subsequent insertion of the label information and barcode.\n3. Begin photography, processing only one bean line per pass to avoid mixing or confusion of the material. Before recording, verify the identity of the material.\n4. Within the project space, the name of the image should be set to start with the unique IncreaseID followed by the sample ID or plant ID, and a unique image number separated by underscores, as: <IncreaseID>_<SampleID>_<ImageID>\n5. Set the image resolution and size. The resolution and size of an image depends on the intended use. The higher the initial values, the more versatile the application is, as smaller versions can be easily created. The following values in Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.133#cpz1133-tbl-0001] provide the guidelines for the resolution.

Transfer the finalized images to a central repository for the project and reference them in a management system.\nWorking versions of the images should be clearly labeled. It is recommended that interim versions not be deleted before safe storage of the final images.\n8.

    "The main aim of this protocol is the phenotypic evaluation of the different lines grown in controlled conditions during the cycles of seed multiplication. These phenotypic data, along with those obtained by applying Basic Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.133#cpz1133-prot-0001] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.133#cpz1133-prot-0002], will be uploaded into the project database and integrated with those obtained for the same lines in other experiments (i.e., field trials). All of these data will represent precious information for future users, such as researchers, breeders, and so on.\nUsers should record the following Mandatory Traits (Priority 1, steps 1-27), which are considered as essential within INCREASE and must be recorded for each selfing cycle, along with Non-Mandatory Traits (Priority 2, steps 28-33). Non-Mandatory Traits are considered within INCREASE as non-essential, but preferable. The collection of Non-Mandatory Traits overlaps with the collection of Mandatory Traits, and thus the step numbers are not fully sequential in time.\nNOTE: This protocol assumes that plants and seeds are evaluated by visual inspection and manual measurement.\nNOTE: During Primary Seed Increase, one plant is grown and characterized for each line, for at least the first two selfing cycles (development of SSD seeds); in subsequent cycles it may be possible to grow more than one plant per line, depending on the available space in controlled conditions (see Fig. 3). If more than three plants are grown per line, traits can be recorded on a subsample (at least three randomly chosen plants).\nNOTE: Before starting the protocol, collect the following information on the experimental site: data collector name, location of experimental trial, latitude of experimental trial, longitude of experimental trial, altitude of experimental trial, and controlled-condition/insect-free measures applied (e.g., tunnel, greenhouse, grow chamber).\nMaterials\nSeeds\nRuler\nAnalytical balance\nSpreadsheet software\nRecording Mandatory Traits (Priority 1)",
