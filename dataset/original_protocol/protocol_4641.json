    "Part I. DNase treatmentPrepare total RNA from cell and tissue samples of human or animals by TRIzol reagent or miRNeasy kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Mix following reagents in microtubes for DNase treatment on ice. table:\n﻿0,1\nComponent,Volume (µl/reaction)\nRNA (100 ng/µl),2\nDNase I,0.5\n10x DNase I buffer,2\nPCR grade water,15.5\nTotal volume,20\nNote: For measurement of ms2 modification in multiple samples, it is recommended to prepare a master mixture of all reagents except RNA to reduce variability. When preparing a master mixture, it is usually desirable to prepare a slight excess to compensate for pipetting inaccuracies.Put microtubes in PCR apparatus and use the following program.table:\n﻿0,1,2\nTime and temperature,Time and temperature,Time and temperature\nDigestion,Inactivation,Hold\n37 °C for 20 min,75 °C for 10 min,4 °C\nUse DNase I-treated sample for subsequent reverse transcription or store at -80 °C.Part II. Reverse transcription imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160103/20160103180151_2058.jpgFigure 1. Workflow of the method to detect ms2 modification. The mitochondrial tRNA is reversely transcribed by r1 primer and r2 primer, respectively. Because of the inhibitory effect of ms2-modification to the reverse transcription, the amount of cDNA generated by r2 primer (Green lines) highly depends on the ms2 levels in a given RNA sample. On the other hand, the cDNA generated by r1 primer (Blue lines) is independent of ms2 level, and could be utilized as an internal control. The amount of each cDNA is quantified by a subsequent quantitative PCR (qPCR) using f1 and r1 primers.For each tRNA species, mix DNase I-digested RNA with primer r1 or primer r2 on ice.table:\n﻿0,1,2\nComponent,Volume (µl/reaction),Volume (µl/reaction)\n,Sample (r1),Sample (r2)\nDNase-digested RNA,2.5,2.5\nPrimer r1 (10 µM),1,―\nPrimer r2 (10 µM),―,1\nWater,3,3\nTotal volume,6.5,6.5",

    "Part IV. Data analysis Analyze data from Samples (r1) and (r2) to obtain Ct values. The results obtained Samples (r1) and (r2) represents the total tRNA level and ms2-modification level in individual tRNA, respectively. The normalized modification level in any given RNA sample is calculated as dCt = Ct (r2) – Ct (r1). Because the dCt value precisely reflects the modification level (Xie et al., 2013), the dCt value could be directly used for comparison of modification levels between multiple samples (see below for the representative data)."
