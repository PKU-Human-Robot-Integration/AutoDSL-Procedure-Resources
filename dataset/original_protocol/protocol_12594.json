    "This protocol was developed using human plasma samples from consented individuals with approval from the Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board (NA_00092491).\n1. Sample collection and preparation\nCollect 5 mL of whole blood from the antecubital vein via standard venipuncture methods34 into a 6 mL vacutainer ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) collection tube.\nAdd 0.5 mL of aprotinin (10,000 KIU/mL) competitive serine protease inhibitor to the tube after collection to block the lysis of the target peptide. Invert the tube 10 times to allow the aprotinin to adequately mix with the blood. Afterward, store the tubes on ice until the next step.\nCentrifuge the tube at 604 x g for 4 min at 4 °C within 60 min of blood collection.\nTake off the plasma fraction with a pipette and transfer to 2 mL round-bottom sterile cryovials.\nImmediately store the cryovials at -80 °C for up to 2 weeks.\n2. Extraction of the plasma samples\nPlace an extraction cartridge inside a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube with the outer ridges of the cartridge supported by the outer ridges of the tube.\nActivate the cartridge by first passing 5 mL of 100% methanol and then 10 mL of ultrapure water through the cartridge.\n\t\nAs fluid is passed through the cartridge via gravity-driven flow, it will collect in the tube.\nThrow out excess fluid as it accumulates to ensure that the fluid does not engulf the cartridge.\nEnsure that the cartridge does not dry during the course of the experiment.\nDilute 250 µL of plasma with 750 µL of 4% acetic acid.\nPass the 1 mL of plasma and acetic acid solution slowly through the cartridge.\n\tNOTE: This step should take approximately 30 s via gravity-driven flow for each milliliter passed.",
    "Wash the cartridge with 10 mL of 4% acetic acid. As done previously, throw out the excess fluid as it accumulates to ensure that the fluid does not engulf the cartridge.\nAfter the last drop of acetic acid is released from the cartridge, remove the cartridge from the tube and place it in a new 15 mL conical centrifuge tube.\nPrepare a 10:1 solution of 100% methanol and 4% acetic acid by mixing 2.7 mL of 4% acetic acid and 0.3 mL of 100% methanol. Use this to elute the CGRP by passing this solution through the cartridge 1 mL at a time. Pause for 25 min between each milliliter of solution passed. Do NOT throw out the eluent.\nThe tube will contain 3 mL of the eluted fluid 25 min after the last milliliter of the methanol and acetic acid solution has passed. Place each 1 mL of the eluent into a 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube.\n\tNOTE: This should yield three microcentrifuge tubes from each cartridge.\nPlace each tube in a mini centrifuge for 1 s to ensure that all the eluent is at the bottom of each tube.\nDry all the samples by vacuum centrifugation at 4 °C (set to concentrator function, for aqueous solutions, at 1,400 rpm; the g-force varies depending on the position of the tubes and therefore ranges from 130-250 x g).\n\tNOTE: The time taken for the vacuum centrifuge to dry the samples will depend on the type of microcentrifuge tube used.\nImmediately before proceeding to the assay procedure (step 4.1), reconstitute the previously dried sample with enzyme immunoassay (EIA) buffer (see Table of Materials) thawed to room temperature (RT) or 20 °C.",
    "​NOTE: The volume of EIA buffer used to reconstitute the dried sample should be equal to the original sample volume, or 250 µL.\n3. Preparation of the ELISA plate - blocking to limit non-specific binding\nAdd 250 µL of tris-buffered saline (TBS)/fish gelatin blocking buffer to each well on the plate.\nPlace a cover sheet over the plate and incubate for 2 h at RT.\nRemove the cover sheet and empty the plate by inversion or aspiration using a multichannel pipette. Then, blot the plate on a paper towel to discard any trace of liquid.\nDry the plate by leaving the plate in a laminar flow hood for 10 min.\nAfter the plate is visibly dry, place it in a grip-sealed foil pouch with a silica gel desiccant sachet and store the pouch at -20 °C for 24 h.\n\t​NOTE: The plates should be used within 4 weeks of plate incubation.\n4. Prior to the assay procedure\nPrepare reagents (EIA buffer, CGRP standard, CGRP quality control, CGRP tracer, wash buffer) as per the kit instructions. Prepare Ellman's reagent only after the 16-20 h incubation period ends.\nThaw all samples and reagents to RT before performing the rest of the protocol.\n5. Assay procedure\nRinse each well in the blocked plate five times with a kit-provided wash buffer (300 µL/well). For each rinse, pause 30 s after placing the wash buffer in the wells, then throw out the liquid or aspirate using a multichannel pipette.\nAfter the final rinse, remove all the buffer from the wells by inversion (inverting the plate to expel the liquid within wells) or aspiration using a multichannel pipette. Blot the last drops onto a paper towel and tap the inverted plate until all the liquid is visibly removed from the wells.",
    "Set aside at least two wells with no reagents or buffer to be known as \"Blank\" wells. Then, set aside at least two other wells for non-specific binding (NSB).\nDispense 100 µL of EIA buffer into each NSB well.\nDispense 100 µL of the CGRP standards in duplicate into appropriate wells.\nDispense 100 µL of samples (reconstituted in EIA buffer) and quality control in duplicate into appropriate wells.\nDispense 100 µL of CGRP tracer (anti-CGRP antibody attached to acetylcholinesterase) to each well containing NSB, CGRP standards, samples, and quality control. Do not dispense tracer to the \"Blank\" wells.\nCover the plate using a clear cover sheet, sealing each well such that the samples and reagents in each well do not evaporate significantly. Incubate the plate for 16-20 h at 4 °C.\nAfter incubation is completed, reconstitute the Ellman's reagent as per the kit instructions.\nInvert the plate to remove all liquid. Rinse each well (as described above) three times with 300 µL of wash buffer.\nAfter the third rinse, remove the liquid from the plates, place the plate on a shaker plate, and shake at 120 rpm for 2 min.\nWash the plate an additional three times. After the final rinse, remove all buffer from the wells by inversion or aspiration using a multichannel pipette. Blot the last drops of liquid onto a paper towel and tap the inverted plate until all the liquid is visibly removed from the wells.\n\tNOTE: The additional three washes described in this step may not be necessary if using an ELISA microplate washer.\nDispense 200 µL of Ellman's reagent into each well (not including the \"Blank\" wells).",
    "Cover the plate with a new cover sheet and wrap it in aluminum foil to prevent any light exposure. Incubate in the dark at RT for 1 h.\nEnsure that there is no liquid on the backside of the plate that may confound the spectrophotometer reading by wiping the backside with a dry paper towel.\nRead the plate for absorbance at 405 nm (yellow color).\n6. Data analysis\nCalculate the average absorbance for each \"Blank\", NSB, standard, quality control, and the samples.\nSubtract the NSB average absorbance values from the standard, quality control, and sample absorbance values.\nPlot absorbance on the y-axis and concentration on the x-axis. Construct a standard curve using a four-parameter logistic regression model.\nOnce the curve is constructed, use the curve's equation to determine the interpolated concentrations for quality control and samples, which can be read on the x-axis.\n\tNOTE: The standard curve is validated only if the calculated interpolated concentration for the quality control is within 25% of the expected concentration (usually 125 pg/mL, but see the label of the quality control vial).\nSubscription Required.
