    "Patulin induction with PDA (solid) medium (Zong et al., 2015)Five-microliter spore suspension (5 x 106/ml in 16% glycerol, stored at -80 °C) of Penicillium expansum is inoculated on PDA plate (Figure 1A) and cultured for 2 weeks at 25 °C in the dark. Conidia are harvested with a glass spreading rod with 3-5 ml 0.05% Tween 20 (Figure 1B) and filtered through four layers of sterile cheesecloth (Figure 1C). Conidia are counted with a hemocytometer and diluted to a concentration of 1 x 105 conidia/ml with sterile distilled water.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170531/20170531030350_1467.jpgFigure 1. Preparation of P. expansum spore suspension. A. Activation of P. expansum on PDA plate; B. Conidia harvesting with 0.05% Tween 20; C. Filtration of spore suspension with four layers of sterile cheesecloth.Five-microliter spore suspension is inoculated at the center of 9-cm PDA plates and incubated at 25 °C in the dark for 10 days (Figure 2A).Each of the Petri dish is washed with a glass spreading rod with 5 ml of acidified distilled water (pH 4.0) and the spore suspension is transferred to a 10 ml centrifuge tube with a 100-1,000 µl pipette (Figure 2B). Then, the spore suspension is centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 min and the supernatant is filtered through a 0.45 μm filter for patulin detection.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170531/20170531030447_8310.jpgFigure 2.

The spore suspension washed with 5 ml of acidified distilled water (pH 4.0).Patulin induction with CY (liquid) mediumP. expansum spore suspension is prepared as described above and diluted to a concentration of 1 x 106 conidia/ml with sterile distilled water.",
    "Aliquots of 1 μl of spore suspension are spread on cellophane sheets (1 x 1 cm) placed on PDA plates and cultured at 25 °C for 36 h (Figure 3A). Then the cellophane sheets covered with P. expansum mycelia are transferred to CY liquid medium. Each cellophane sheet is floated on 1 ml CY liquid medium in a 24-well culture plate (Figure 3B). The whole plate is covered and sealed with Parafilm, then cultured under static conditions at 25 °C in the dark. At 48 h after transfer, mycelium and spores are collected with a tweezer and quickly frozen with liquid nitrogen for some other use (RNA/DNA/protein extraction) and the medium (Figure 3C) is filtered through a 0.45 μm filter for patulin detection.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170531/20170531030732_9256.jpgFigure 3.

Cellophane sheets covered with mycelium incubated on CY liquid medium in a 24-well culture plate; C. CY medium after removal of mycelium.HPLC analysisHigh-performance liquid chromatography analysis is performed for determining patulin production.10 μl of the filtrate extract is injected into a liquid chromatography equipped with an auto sampler (WATERS 2498), a binary HPLC pump (WATERS 1525), and a UV/Visible detector (WATERS 2487). A C18 column (5 μm, 250 x 4.6 mm, GL Sciences, Japan) is used for patulin detection.The mobile phase is a mixture of water and acetonitrile (90:10, v/v) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min in isocratic elution mode.The detection wavelength of patulin is 276 nm and the column oven is set at 25 °C."
