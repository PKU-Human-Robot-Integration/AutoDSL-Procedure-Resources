    "Total lipid extraction (TLE) is a technique based on the like-dissolves-like principle of solvent separation, whereby solvents readily dissolve analytes of approximately the same polarity. Typically, an azeotrope of solvents is refluxed through a ground plant, rock, or unconsolidated soil or sediment sample to isolate leaf waxes. There are multiple ways to extract lipids, of which the most common are the use of a Soxhlet apparatus, accelerated or pressurized solvent extraction (ASE or PSE), and ultrasonic extraction. Although Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20114#cppb20114-prot-0001] will focus on PSE, the different techniques share inherent principles in that the goal of each is to ensure high analyte recovery while reducing time and solvent consumption and avoiding carryover or cross-contamination between samples. Each extraction technique requires samples to be homogenous and dry and equipment to be precleaned, so sample pretreatment and cleaning recommendations are included in each protocol. See Alternate Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20114#cppb20114-prot-0004] (Soxhlet extraction) and 2 (ultrasonic extraction) for the extraction of total lipids when PSE is not available.",
    "A PSE apparatus is an automated system for extracting organic compounds from a variety of solid and semisolid samples. Although these are still relatively rare pieces of equipment in many labs, they are quickly being adopted because of their efficiency in extracting compounds over short time periods. PSE uses elevated temperature and pressure in combination with organic solvents to increase the efficiency of the extraction process. During the procedure, an extraction cell containing the sample is filled with solvent and then heated and pressurized to maintain the solvent in a liquid state for a predetermined amount of time. After this hold time, the extract is discharged from the cell into a collection vessel, and then the process is repeated. PSE has major benefits over other methods in terms of speed and overall compound recoverability. First, higher temperatures increase the extraction speed and the solubility of lipid analytes. Elevated pressure allows temperatures above the solvent boiling points to be used, which is essential given that the boiling points of organic solvents and target lipid compounds are often low (see solvents listed in Materials). Operating at elevated pressure also expedites and enhances the overall extraction, as pressurized solvent is forced into and through the pore spaces of the sediments, improving biomarker recovery.",
    "The type of solvent used has a major impact on the extraction, and it is best to choose solvents with polarities similar to those of the target lipids; in this instance, the target analytes are nonpolar (n-alkanes) and slightly polar (n-alkanoic acids as fatty acid methyl esters). Mixtures of solvents with different polarities often provide better recoveries. A temperature of 100°C, a pressure of 1500 psi (103 bar), and a 9:1 volume/volume mixture of dichloromethane and methanol have been shown to be good starting points for a wide range of extraction applications.\nMaterials\nCompressed nitrogen gas (N2), 99.99% purity\nDichloromethane (DCM), HPLC grade, 39.7°C boiling point, 3.1 polarity index (Millipore Sigma cat. no.

Homogenize samples using mortar and pestle (precleaned with DCM and MeOH) so that each is uniform in particle size.\n16. Transfer samples to individual, precleaned, labeled 60-ml glass vials or porcelain evaporation dishes, and oven dry or lyophilize. Residual water can reduce extraction efficiency, so be sure that samples are completely dry before extracting.\nUse porcelain evaporating dishes if oven drying and 60-ml glass vials for lyophilizing (freeze drying).\nThe drying time depends on the water content of the sample, but lyophilization should be done for at least 24 hr and oven drying for at least 48 hr at 60°C.\nIf lyophilizing, remove the caps from the glass vials and cover with Kimwipes™ secured with rubber bands.\n17. After drying, weigh out sample amounts for extraction using an analytical balance and weigh boats.",
    "The amount of sample being extracted depends on the age of the material and the organic content. With younger material, less overall sample (by weight) is needed: that is, only 1-2 g of modern material such as ground plant leaves or topsoil may suffice for a successful extraction. On the other hand, with more ancient sediments, such as paleosols from the Pleistocene, 20-30 g (or more) may be required.\nTo determine the amount of sample needed for successful lipid extraction, experiment with one or two samples using different sample amounts by weighing the overall yield (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20114#cppb20114-prot-0002]).\nIn some cases, the organic content of a sediment may be low regardless of age. In this instance, include a larger amount of sample in the extraction to achieve results.\n18. Mix the weighed sample with Ottawa sand.\nThe amount of sand needed will depend on the sample weight and grain size and the size of the extraction cell. Büchi recommends a sand-to-sample ratio of 5:1, but this can be modified depending on experimental results and whether samples are efficiently extracted with a smaller ratio.\n19. Gently pour the sample-sand mixture into a cleaned PSE extraction cell using the precleaned (DCM and MeOH) stainless steel funnel that is provided with the PSE. Do not fill the cell completely, but retain a void ∼0.5-1 cm in height from the top of the inner shoulder of the cell to prevent sample clogging.\n20. Use DCM-rinsed forceps and Büchi-provided plunger to place a cellulose top filter into the open-ended PSE extraction cell so that it rests on the inner shoulder.\n21. Label the 150-ml wide-necked collection vessel with permanent marker; include initials, date, sample name, and project name.",
    "Do not attach labels to the extraction cell as the high temperatures in the PSE will damage the label.\nEvery extraction cell is etched with a serial number, which can be included in the label of the collection vessel.\nExtraction process\n22. Make sure the solvent reservoirs with DCM and MeOH are filled and connected to the corresponding ports on the right side of the PSE.\n23. Select EXTRACTION >> OPEN METHOD, and select the method created in steps 6-14.\n24. Select EXTRACTION >> PREHEAT. Wait for the oven to reach 100°C.\n25. Place the filled extraction cells in the heating block and the corresponding labeled collection vessels in the vessel tray, so that Sample X goes in heating block position 1 and Collection Vessel X goes in vessel tray position 1.\n26. Push the heating block with samples into the PSE, close the glass screen, and mount the vessel tray into the mounting fixture.\n27. Activate the extraction positions by using the LCD control panel and select EXTRACTION >> OCCUPIED POSITIONS >> OCCUPY ALL >> YES.\nAlternatively, if processing fewer than six samples, specify the positions occupied by extraction cells.\nAll six heating block positions must contain a cell, however, even if the cell is empty. Solvent will only pass through the positions denoted as occupied.\n28. Push START to extract the samples.\nIf a problem (such as a leak) occurs during an extraction, the PSE will pause and will need to be reset.\nPost-extraction procedures\n29. CAUTION: Be careful handling the cells after extraction, as they will be extremely hot and can cause burns.\n30. Remove the heating block, and take out the extraction cells using the extraction cell gripper (provided by Büchi).\nPlace the hot extraction cells into the portable cell rack and let cool.",
    "31. Once the cell has cooled, remove the top cellulose filter and pour the sample-sand mixture into a labeled sample bag.\nAlthough the lipids should now be extracted from the sample, store the mixture until analysis is fully complete.\n32. Disassemble the PSE cell by removing the bottom plug screw, metal frit, and bottom cellulose filter.\nSee Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20114#cppb20114-prot-0003] for cleaning the cells.\n33. Remove the collection vessels from the tray rack, and evaporate the solvent using rotary or vacuum evaporation until only ∼1 ml of solvent remains.\nThe collection vessels have a 1-ml residual volume marking on the glass.\nEvaporation with nitrogen gas is another option, but this will take a long time and use a lot of nitrogen.\n34. Transfer the ∼1 ml of solvent to an oven-cleaned 4-ml vial labeled with the sample name, date, and “TLE.”\n35. Add 1-2 ml DCM to the collection vessels, rinse the insides thoroughly, and transfer the solvent to the 4-ml vial; repeat this step three times.\nUse a different pipet for each sample.\nThe collection vessel can now be cleaned, first by hand washing and then by oven cleaning at 500°C.\n36. Evaporate the remaining solvent from the 4-ml vial using nitrogen gas.\n37. Store the TLE in a refrigerator.",
    "A simple method for calculating the total amount of lipid extracted from a sample is to weigh the 4-ml vials before and after adding the TLE. This provides a general understanding of the lipid content of a soil, sediment, or paleosol, which can then be compared across all samples analyzed. It also indicates whether the total amount of sample needed for extraction must be increased and whether the extraction protocol is working efficiently. If the TLE weight is >35 mg, split into two aliquots (store one, use another for analysis) to avoid overloading the column during chromatography.\nMaterials\nTotal lipid extract (TLE) from Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20114#cppb20114-prot-0001]\nCompressed nitrogen gas (N2), 99.99% purity\n4-ml borosilicate glass screw-thread vials with PTFE-lined caps\nAnalytical balance\n14.6-cm (5 3/4-inch) borosilicate glass Pasteur pipet\nNitrogen evaporator (e.g., Thermo Scientific Reacti-Vap Nitrogen Evaporator)\n1. Label 4-ml vials with the sample name, date, and “TLE.”\n2. With the caps on, record the weight of the labeled 4-ml vials.\n3. Transfer the TLE to the 4-ml vials (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20114#cppb20114-prot-0001], steps 29-37).\n4. Evaporate the solvent from the 4-ml vials using nitrogen gas.\nIf the extraction was successful, the TLE should be visible in the 4-ml vials.\n5. Reweigh and record the weight of the 4-ml vials now containing the TLE.\n6. Subtract the weights of each sample from step 2 (empty vial) from that of step 5 (vial with TLE).\n7. To compare TLE across samples, divide the weight of the TLE (likely in mg) from the weight of the sediment (likely in g) used in the extraction.\nThis will give a value in mg/g that can be compared across samples.",
    "The best method for cleaning the stainless-steel extraction cells is through the PSE. After they are washed with mildly alkaline liquid detergent and thoroughly rinsed with water to remove all soap traces, empty cells can be added to the PSE and cleaned with the same solvents used during extractions.

    "Soxhlet is designed to extract organic materials from crushed rocks, sediments, and recent biological materials by distillation and the continuous recycling of solvent. This method is the most commonly used extraction technique, even though it is gradually being replaced by automated solvent extraction (Richter, Jones, Ezell, & Porter, 1996[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20114#cppb20114-bib-0060]). This is the longest of the techniques described here and can take up to 72 hr to finish extracting total lipids. The advantages are that it uses small amounts of solvent and is relatively maintenance free except for cleaning the Soxhlet after the extraction. During the procedure, organic solvent is evaporated and refluxed into an Allihn (bulb) condenser where cool temperatures condense the vapor back into liquid solvent, causing it to drip into the extraction chamber containing the sample. The condensed solvent fills the extraction chamber while bonding to lipids and siphons the extracted organics into the boiling flask.

    "Ultrasonic extraction is typically used when only a small amount of sample (≤10 g) is available or where it is desirable to quickly test the organic content in a sediment. Depending on the number of samples being extracted, however, it can be a very time-consuming process. It involves agitating the sample using temperature and high-frequency vibrations in dichloromethane and methanol to isolate organic compounds from a soil or sediment sample. In this technique, cavitation bubbles generated by high-frequency sound remove total lipids bound in a sedimentary matrix. Samples are then centrifuged and the organic solvent (with TLE) is filtered into glass vials and evaporated. The major benefit of ultrasonic extraction is that an ultrasonic cleaner is a relatively inexpensive instrument and can be purchased for about the same cost as one Soxhlet apparatus (∼$600 USD for a 3-liter tank).

    "Column chromatography is an analytical technique used to separate organic compounds into individual components, so that these components can be analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Like total lipid extraction, column separation is based on the principle that like dissolves like, whereby solvents readily elute analytes of approximately the same polarity. Generally, the targeted analyte is dissolved in various organic solvents and loaded onto the column, and due to solvent polarity, the different compounds of the analyte either adhere to or elute through the column. Two different stationary-phase separation techniques are outlined in the following protocols: (1) aminopropyl column chromatography (this protocol) and (2) silver nitrate (SiAgNO3)-infused silica gel column chromatography (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20114#cppb20114-prot-0007]); and (3) silica gel column chromatography.\nAminopropyl (NH2(CH2)3) column chromatography is a silica-based stationary-phase extraction technique in which the silica gel is functionalized with amino groups. Silica is a polar adsorbent, so nonpolar compounds (e.g., n-alkanes) elute before more polar compounds. This is a normal-phase ion-exchange chromatographic type that uses stationary-phase columns to retain polar analytes, and nonpolar mobile-phase solvents to separate neutral lipids from fatty acids and phospholipids out of the TLE. Neutral lipids, or those soluble only in solvents of very low polarity, are eluted with 2:1 DCM/isopropanol, fatty acids with 4% glacial acetic acid in diethyl ether, and polar phospholipids with MeOH. The ability of aminopropyl columns to retain acids when total extracts are eluted with DCM/isopropanol, and then release the acids when eluted with acetic acid in ether, make this the ideal technique for quickly separating carboxylic acids from the neutral lipid fractions before further separation into n-alkanes and n-alkanoic acids.\nMaterials\nDichloromethane (DCM), HPLC grade, 39.7°C boiling point, 3.1 polarity index (Millipore Sigma cat. no.

    "SiAgNO3 is chromatographic technique designed to separate organic compounds according to polarity. It is based on the ability of silver ions (Ag+) to interact with unsaturated compounds (e.g., alkenes; McWilliams & Angelici, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20114#cppb20114-bib-0051]; Nikolova-Damyanova, 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20114#cppb20114-bib-0053]) so that straight-chain hydrocarbons (n-alkanes and n-alkanoic acids) can be isolated from other neutral or acidic compounds. Silver ions form weak, reversible electron donor–acceptor complexes with multiple-bonded compounds to separate lipids based on their degree of unsaturation and resolve complex lipid mixtures into simpler molecular species (Nikolova-Damyanova, 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20114#cppb20114-bib-0053]). This is often used to minimize the impact of unresolved complex mixtures on sample analysis. Therefore, SiAgNO3 is well suited for isolating saturated n-alkanes and n-alkanoic acids from unsaturated compounds that may form due to compound (bio)degradation.\nNOTE: Although Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20114#cppb20114-prot-0007] is used to isolate both n-alkanes and n-alkanoic acids, the “Acid” fraction must first be methylated.

    "Gas chromatography mass spectrometry is an analytical technique for identifying and quantifying organic compounds in complex matrices. The gas chromatograph separates compounds by (i) volatilizing a sample in a heated inlet, (ii) using an inert carrier gas (e.g., helium) to transfer the sample from the inlet through a fused silica capillary column containing a stationary-phase coating, and (iii) passing the sample from the column into the mass spectrometer, which provides structural information on the injected compounds. The mass spectrometer ionizes the analytes eluting through the GC column as they enter the detector, and the ions are deflected by a magnetic field and finally distinguished electrically according to their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z). The fragmentation of the ions that represent the original molecule injected into the GC is then used to determine the structure of targeted compounds.

Create a new method with the recommended parameters above using the Agilent GC-MS (MSD ChemStation) software.\nNote that some variables, such as flow rates and pressures, will vary from instrument to instrument.\nMethods can be created directly on the GC instrument panel, but it is easier to use the provided software.\n13.

Run the n-alkane and FAMEs standards on the GC-MS apparatus.\n18. Run the prepared samples from steps 1-7 on the GC-MS apparatus.\n19. Use the retention times and m/z ratios of the C21-C40 n-alkane or C4-C24 FAMEs standards to compare with retention times and m/z ratios of the unknown samples (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20114#cppb20114-fig-0003]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/af255616-efb5-4872-8748-361965b42b56/cppb20114-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nThree mass spectra for the molecular ions representing the mass of the C29-C33 n-alkanes.

    "Gas chromatography isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-IRMS, or IRMS) follows the same principles as GC-MS, except that instead of yielding structural information by scanning fragmented ions, IRMS measures, with high precision, small variations in the relative abundances of carbon (13C/12C) and hydrogen (2H/1H or D/H) isotopes, as well as nitrogen (15N/14N), oxygen (18O/16O), sulfur (34S/32S), and other elements and their isotopes. Samples are first converted to gas (e.g., H2, CO2) before the mass spectrometer calculates the corresponding ratio of ions within the gas and monitors the mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios of the target compounds. For example, in the analysis of 13C to 12C, the mass spectrometer monitors the ions with m/z values of 44, 45, and 46, which correspond to the ions produced from CO2 molecules containing 12C and 13C, as well as 16O, 17O, and 18O in various combinations (Carter & Barwick, 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20114#cppb20114-bib-0012]). Therefore, minute variations in the natural abundance of the heavier isotope can be detected in the presence of larger amounts of the lighter isotope. This ratio—(R) abundance of heavy isotope/abundance of light isotope—is expressed using the delta (δ) notation in units of per mil (‰), which reports changes in isotopic abundance as deviations compared to a designated isotope standard. Isotope composition of a sample is expressed (see Equation 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20114#cppb20114-disp-0003]):\n         imgsrc:/cms/asset/6920f5c8-6dbb-4d19-ac0a-ae1cf8da1337/cppb20114-math-0002.pngwhere δHX is the heavy isotope mass of element X (e.g., δ2H, δ13C) relative to a standard, Rsample is the ratio if the heavy isotope to the lighter isotope of element X in the sample (e.g., 2H/1H, 13C/12C), and Rstandard is the ratio of the heavy isotope to the lighter isotope of element X in the standard.\nMaterials\nHexane (HEX), HPLC grade, 69°C boiling point, 0.1 polarity index (Millipore Sigma cat. no. 100795)\nCompressed nitrogen gas (N2), 99.99% purity",
