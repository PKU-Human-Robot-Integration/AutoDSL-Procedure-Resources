    "1. Establishment of Three Independent Afatinib-resistant PC-9 Cell Lines\nDetermination of the initial afatinib exposure concentration for PC-9 cells using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay\nCulture PC-9 cells in growth medium containing fetal bovine serum (10%), penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 µg/mL) in a cell-culture treated 10-cm dish in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C.\nResuspend PC-9 cells at 4 x 104 cells/mL in growth medium and then seed at 50 µL/well in a 96-well microplate. The final concentration of cells is 2.0 x 103 cells/50 µL/well. Incubate overnight in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C.\nAdd 50 µL of afatinib solution at different concentrations: 0, 0.002, 0.006, 0.02, 0.06, 0.2, 0.6, 2, 6, and 20 µM to the wells containing the growth medium (50 µL). The final volume and concentrations of afatinib are 100 µL and 0, 0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 µM, respectively.\nIncubate the 96-well plate for 96 h in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C.\nAdd 15 µL of the dye solution (see Table of Materials) to each well and incubate for 4 h in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C, and then add 100 µL of solubilization/stop-solution (see Table of Materials) to each well and incubate overnight in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C.\nMeasure the optical density at 570 nm (OD570) using a microplate reader (see Table of Materials). Prepare 6-12 replicates and repeat the experiments at least three times.\nUse statistical software (see Table of Materials) to graphically plot these data as a semi-log graph and calculate the IC50 value, which is the drug concentration that reduces response to 50% of its maximum (see Table of Materials).",
    "Continuous exposure of PC-9 cells to the irreversible EGFR-TKI, afatinib, by stepwise dose escalation in three independent 10 cm dishes\nCulture PC-9 cells in p100 dishes containing 10 mL of growth medium. When the PC-9 cells reach the sub-confluent stage, transfer 1 mL of cell suspension into three new p100 dishes, with 9 mL of growth medium. The 1:10 diluted PC-9 cells become sub-confluent in 3-4 days, with a cell number of approximately 4-5 x 105 cells/mL.\nOn the next day, add 1/10 of the IC50 value of afatinib into each of the three p100 dishes.\nNOTE: Afatinib is reconstituted in DMSO at stock concentrations of 1 μM, 10 µM, 100 µM, 1 mM, and 5 mM. 1 to 10 µL of afatinib-solution is added into 10 mL of growth medium in the culture, as per the required final concentrations.\nWhen the cells in the afatinib-containing p100 dishes become sub-confluent, mix well by aspiration with a 1 mL pipette and add 1 mL of the cell suspension to 9 mL of fresh growth medium in a new p100 dish. Next, add 10-20% higher concentrations of afatinib to the new culture.\nIncrease the afatinib concentration of 0.1 nM to 1 μM in the medium by the stepwise dose escalation with the afatinib concentration increased by 10-20% at each step over the period of 10-12 months.\nNOTE: When the afatinib concentration approaches the IC50 value, cell growth becomes quite slow. If the cells are split 1:9, they may not grow, as these cells are killed by higher concentrations of afatinib. Therefore, at higher afanitib concentrations, the cells can be split at a ratio of 1:2. The most resistant cells were grown in afatinib-contained medium for 3-14 days, and the medium was not changed until the resistant cells needed to be passaged.",
    "Culture the afatinib-resistant cells for 2-3 months in 1 µM afatinib-containing growth medium. At an afatinib concentration of 1 µM, 10-12 months are required for developing resistance to afatinib in this model. Perform the MTT assay to confirm that the cells are resistant to afatinib. The three independently established afatinib resistance cell lines were named AFR1, AFR2, and AFR3.\n2. Characterization of Three Independent Afatinib-resistant Cells\nDetermination of the growth curve of parental PC-9 cells and establishment of afatinib-resistant cells\nCulture the PC-9, AFR1, AFR2, and AFR3 cells in growth medium in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C.\nResuspend the cells at 5 x 103 cells/mL with growth medium, and seed 100 µL/well into a 96-well microplate, such that the final concentration of cells is 500 cells/100 µL/well.\nNOTE: The MTT assay is performed to measure the OD570 values at 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 days. Six 96-well microplates are required for each day.\nPerform the MTT assay every 24 h and then on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7. Measure the OD570 values and prepare 6-12 replicates; repeat the experiments at least three times, and graphically plot the results using a statistical software (see Table of Materials).\nIdentification of the genomic DNA alterations in EGFR by real-time PCR\nNOTE: Afatinib is a small molecule inhibitor that targets EGFR tyrosine kinase. The EGFR expression status is determined at the DNA and protein levels.\n\t\nGenomic DNA is isolated using a DNA purification kit (see Table of Materials) following the manufacturer's instructions. Measure the concentration of the isolated genomic DNA with a spectrophotometer (see Table of Materials) and adjust all genomic DNA samples to 25 ng/ µL.",
    "Amplify 50 ng of genomic DNA, which is equivalent to 2 µL of the 25 ng/µL stocks, using a SYBR Green master mix (see Table of Materials) and analyze the results using a fluorescence-based RT-PCR-detection system (see Table of Materials).\nNOTE: PCR cycling conditions began with an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 20 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C denaturation for 3 s, 60 °C annealing for 30 s. The specific primer sets are as follows: EGFR F: 5′-CAAGGCCATGGAATCTGTCA-3′, R: 5′-CTGGAATGAGGTGGAGGAACA-3′. Normalization gene LINE-1 F: 5′-AAAGCCGCTCAACTACATGG-3′, R: 5′-TGCTTTGAATGCGTCCCAGAG-3′.\nEvaluation of the effect of protein alterations on the EGFR level by western blot analysis\nTreat the cells with afatinib continuously prior to experiments for 24 h. Wash PC-9, AFR1, AFR2, and AFR3 cells twice with PBS and then seed them in growth media without afatinib. Wash PC-9, AFR1, AFR2, and AFR3 cells twice with 5 mL of ice-cold PBS.\nLyse the cells in RIPA buffer containing 1% protease inhibitor cocktail (see Table of Materials) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail II and III (see Table of Materials) and incubate this solution at 4 °C for 30 min. Centrifuge the lysates for 10 min at 100 x g and 4 °C and collect the cleared lysates.\nDetermine protein concentrations using the bicinchoninic acid assay (see Table of Materials), adjust all protein samples to 0.5 or 1 µg/µL using 4x sample buffer (500 mM Tris (PH 6.8), 40% glycerol, 8% SDS, 20% H2O, 0.02% bromophenol blue) and boil at 96 °C for 5 min. Store these protein samples at -80 °C until western blot analysis is performed.\nSeparate equal amounts of protein samples, preferably 20-30 µL, by 8% SDS-page and transfer the proteins to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane.",
    "NOTE: Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) is commonly used in the lab for the separation of proteins based on their molecular weight.\n\t\t\nClean glass plates with ethanol and assemble the glass plate and spacers. Prepare 8% poly-acrylamide gels containing 1.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 40% Bis-acrylamide, 10% SDS, 10% APS, and TEMED. Polymerize for 30 min at room temperature.\nSubsequently, prepare a stacking gel containing 0.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 40% bis-acrylamide, 10% SDS, 10% APS, and TEMED. Add the stacking gel solution, insert the comb, and polymerize the gel for 20-30 min at room temperature.\nPlace the gels in the electrophoresis apparatus and fill the tank with running buffer (0.25 M Tris, 1.92 M glycine, and 1% SDS). Load equal amount of protein samples (20-30 µL) and run the gel at 180 V. Stop electrophoresis once the dye front flows out of the gel, after approximately 60 min.\nWash the gel for 1-2 min with TBST and then transfer the proteins on to a PVDF membrane by semi-dry blotting (see Table of Materials) for 1.5 h at a constant current of 300 mA.\nBlock the membranes with 5% of nonfat dry milk (see Table of Materials) diluted with TBST solution (see Table of Materials) for 1 h at room temperature, and then probe the membranes with anti-EGFR, anti-phospho-EGFR (Y1068), anti-HER2, anti-HER3, anti-MET, and anti-actin antibodies (diluted 1:3,000 in TBST) (see Table of Materials) at 4 °C overnight.\nWash the membranes with TBST three times for 10 min, and then expose the membranes to the secondary antibody (diluted 1:200 in TBST) for 1-1.5 h at room temperature. Wash the membranes five times with TBST for 10 min at room-temperature, expose them to the ECL solution (see Table of Materials), and visualize the signals using films.",
    "Analysis of EGFR mutations by sequencing\nAmplify genomic DNA using specific primers for EGFR exons 19-21. The PCR cycling conditions begin with an initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 1 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 98 °C for 10 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min.\nNOTE: The specific primers for EGFR exon 19: F: 5′-GCAATATCAGCCTTAGGTGCGGCTC-3′ R: 5′-CATAGAAAGTGAACATTTAGGATGTG-3′, exon 20: F: 5′-CCATGAGTACGTATTTTGAAACTC-3′, R: 5′-CATATCCCCATGGCAAACTCTTGC-3′, and exon 21: F: 5′-ATGAACATGACCCTGAATTCGG-3′, R: 5′-GCTCACCCAGAATGTCTGGAGA-3′.\nPurify the amplified PCR products using a PCR purification kit (see Table of Materials) and sequence the amplicons.\nSubscription Required.
