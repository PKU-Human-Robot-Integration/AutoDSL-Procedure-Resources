    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSample preparation\nTiming: ∼30 min\nThis step involves the sedation of worms and inserting them into the worm trap of the microfluidics chip.\nSedate worms.\nSelect ∼10 (young) adult worms from the strain you would like to image.\nPut them in a droplet of 10 μL 5 mM levamisole. Cover them with a small petri dish to avoid evaporation of the droplet, which would make the worms dry out.\nIncubate the worms for ∼15 min, till they are fully sedated and you cannot see them moving anymore.\nNote: Whether a worm does or does not fit well in the worm trap, depends on the worm’s thickness. The older the worms, the thicker they are. By experience, you will figure out which worms fit your chip best.\nUse a stainless steel pin (New England small tube corporation, 0.025″ OD × 0.013″ ID) into a Tygon tube to flush the chip with buffer (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A–2C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2489-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Sample preparation and microfluidics set-up\n(A) Stainless steel pin in Tygon tubing, which is via a valve connected to a 3 mL syringe filled with M13 buffer.\n(B) Picture of the microfluidics chip as presented by Chronis et al.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] Scalebar: 1 mm. The fluidic inlets are indicated by the number that corresponds to the syringe they have the be connected to.\n(C) Flush the chip with M13 buffer.\n(D) Suck up a worm head-first.\n(E) Insert the steel pin to the inlet of the chip’s worm channel to insert the worm.\n(F) Manually apply pressure to insert the worm. Dotted lines clarify the channels of the chip. Scalebar: 0.5 mm.\n(G) Worm in the chip’s worm trap, with the tail exposed to the fluidic streams. Dotted lines clarify the channels of the chip. Scalebar: 0.5 mm.",
    "(H) Fill four 3 mL syringes with the appropriate solutions: syringe 1 and 4 with 5 μm fluorescein; syringe 2 with your chemosensory stimulus and syringe 3 with M13 buffer.\n(I) Connect the syringes to a pressure controller via Tygon tubing.\n(J) Connect the syringes with Tygon tubing and a stainless-steel pin to the fluidic inlets of the microfluidics chip.\n(K) Put the sample under the microscope.\n(L) Microfluidics set-up with the sample under the microscope.\n(M) Close 3 of the 4 fluidic inlets with a closed steel pin, replace the steel pin that is connected to the M13-filled syringe to the waste outlet and manually apply pressure on the syringe to let the worm leave the chip via the (open) 4th fluidic inlet.\n(N) Worm leaves the chip via channel 2. Arrow indicates direction of movement of the worm.\nNote: the Tygon tube is via a valve connected to a 3 mL syringe filled with M13 buffer.\nNote: this is an additional syringe, specifically used for worm loading, in addition to the four syringes that are connected to the pressure controller.\nNote: Ensure that all in- and outlets are open, i.e., not blocked, and do not contain air bubbles.\nCarefully suck up a worm, head-first, using the stainless steel pin that is connected to the M13-filled syringe such that the worm is placed at the tip of the steel pin (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2D).\nNote: We do this gently manually, with a not well-defined pressure.\nInsert the steel pin to the inlet of the chip’s worm channel (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E) and manually apply pressure to the syringe to ensure the worm enters the worm trap (tail-first) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nGently keep applying pressure till the worm is at the appropriate position (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G).",
    "Note: If the worm does not enter smoothly or gets stuck halfway, it might help to change the direction of the flow back and forth slightly by pushing and pulling gently on the plunger.\nLeave the syringe connected to the insert of the worm trap and close the valve. This will avoid the worm from being pushed back when you apply pressure on the fluidic inlets.\nNote: Sample preparation is a time-consuming step in the process. On a good day, we image 10–20 individual worms, which limits the throughput of this method.\nCalibration of microfluidic flows\nTiming: ∼15 min\nThis step accomplishes the calibration of the microfluidic flows to ensure that the worm is only exposed to the chemosensory stimulus when the pressures are switched to ‘stimulus ON’ mode.\nFill four 3 mL syringes with the appropriate solutions: syringe 1 and 4 with 5 μm fluorescein; syringe 2 with your chemosensory stimulus and syringe 3 with M13 buffer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H).\nConnect the syringes to a pressure controller (Fluigent MFCS™-EZ) via Tygon tubing (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I).\nConnect the syringes with Tygon tubing and a stainless-steel pin to the fluidic inlets of the microfluidics chip (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]J).\nNote: The order in which you connect the syringes does not matter.\nPut the sample under the microscope (a 10× objective works well) (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]K and 2L).\nUsing the Fluigent All-in-one software (included with the pressure controller), apply 100 mbar to channels 1, 3 and 4 and 90 mbar to channel 2, to ensure no stimulus is delivered to the worm prior to starting the experiment (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2489-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Calibration of microfluidic flows\n(A) Apply 100 mbar to channels 1, 3 and 4 and 90 mbar to channel 2.",
    "(B) Decrease the pressure on channel 2 to 0 mbar. A backflush of fluorescein from channel 1 and M13 buffer from channel 3 will occur.\n(C) Apply 100 mbar to channels 1, 3 and 4 and 90 mbar to channel 2. The lower concentration of fluorescein in channel 2 can now be distinguished from the fluorescein in channel 1 and 4 and the colorless buffer in channel 3. Determine the appropriate pressures for ‘stimulus OFF’ mode, so that fluid from channel 2 will not pass the worm’s tail.\n(D) Determine the appropriate pressures for ‘stimulus ON’ mode, so that fluid from channel 2 will pass the worm’s tail.\nGently increase and decrease the pressures on the different channels one by one to check if the flows are properly responding to changes in pressure.\nNote: If the flows do not respond properly to changes in pressure, there may be air bubbles in the tubing or the chip. Swiftly increase and decrease the pressure to let the air bubble get out of the way. See problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nDecrease the pressure on channel 2 to 0 mbar. A backflush of fluorescein from channel 1 and M13 buffer from channel 3 will occur (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). Wait for ∼10 s.\nPut all pressures to 0 mbar, to allow mixing of the fluids. Wait for ∼10 s.\nApply 100 mbar to channels 1, 3 and 4 and 90 mbar to channel 2.\nNote: The lower concentration of fluorescein in channel 2 can now be distinguished from the fluorescein in channel 1 and 4 and the colorless buffer in channel 3 (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C and 3D).\nDetermine the appropriate pressures for ‘stimulus OFF’ and ‘stimulus ON’. Save the settings (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C and 3D).",
    "Note: The precise settings vary every time you do a new experiment, but typically we use pressures for Stimulus OFF: channel 1–25 mbar, channel 2–25 mbar, channel 3–35 mbar, channel 4–30 mbar; and for Stimulus ON: channel 1–30 mbar, channel 2–35 mbar, channel 3–30 mbar, channel 4–30 mbar.\nNote: You can now freely change the pressures in the different channels to find the right settings, because there is no stimulus coming from channel 2.\nSwitch to ‘stimulus OFF’ and wait till the fluorescein from channel 2 has disappeared.\nNow the chemosensory stimulus is coming from channel 2 and you can start your measurement. Remain in ‘stimulus OFF’ mode for now.\nImaging\nTiming: ∼10 min\nThis step includes the actual measurement and data acquisition while exposing the worm to a chemosensory stimulus.\nDepending on your research question, switch to an appropriate objective. We either use a 40× air objective or a 100× oil objective.\nBring the phasmid chemosensory cilia (or other region of your interest) in focus.\nStart acquiring images for a certain time period.\nNote: This is your ‘baseline measurement’, when the worm is exposed to buffer and not yet to a chemosensory stimulus.\nSwitch pressures to ‘stimulus ON’. Write down frame number so that you remember when you switched the stimulus on. See problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nWhen you want to stop the stimulus, switch back to ‘stimulus OFF’ mode. Again, write down the frame number.\nNote: The time frame to record the chemosensory response in C. elegans depends strongly on your scientific question. We typically expose the worm from several seconds to a few minutes. Performing repeated stimuli, prolonged exposure times or recovery experiments (in which you expose the worm to M13 buffer for a long time after exposure to a chemical stimulus) are all possible.",
    "When you want to stop your measurement, stop acquiring images. Put all pressures to 0 mbar and disconnect the tubings from the chip.\nUse the syringe that is still connected to the worm channel to push the worm out of the worm trap, by manually applying pressure to the syringe.\nClose 3 of the 4 fluidic inlets with a closed steel pin, replace the steel pin that is connected to the M13-filled syringe to the waste outlet and manually apply pressure on the syringe to let the worm leave the chip via the (open) 4th fluidic inlet (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]M and 2N).\nAfter the last experiment of the day make sure to clean the chip by flushing it with milliQ. The chip can be used multiple times, as long as it does not leak or is not clogged by dust or PDMS particles.\nPause point: Worms can be imaged for up to two hours after they have been sedated. Afterwards, it is advisable to sedate a new batch of worms."
