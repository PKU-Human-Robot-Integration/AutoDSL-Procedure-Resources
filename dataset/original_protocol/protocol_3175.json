Terminally differentiated human neurons, generated from hESC-derived NPs, are post-mitotic and will not divide after the differentiation process.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] Therefore, the wild-type (ATG5+/+) and autophagy-deficient (ATG5−/−) hESC- derived NPs must be first expanded and then seeded at appropriate densities for neuronal differentiation as per the requirement of the experiments. NPs differentiated from multiple clones of genome-edited ATG5−/− hESCs are recommended to avoid clonal effects. However, this is not necessary for NPs derived from the wild-type parental hESCs on which genome editing was performed to generate the autophagy-deficient clonal lines.\nEstablish ATG5+/+ and 3 independent clones of ATG5−/− hESC-derived NPs in culture.\nWarm the pre-prepared NP culture medium without growth factors at 37°C in a water bath for at least 30 min for use in the steps below.\nMake up 40 mL of complete NP culture medium by adding 8 μL EGF (from 100 μg/mL stock) and 8 μL FGF-2 (from 100 μg/mL stock) to the pre-prepared NP culture medium without growth factors. Mix by inversion.\nRemove laminin solution from plates, add NP culture medium (1 mL per well of 6-well plate) and warm in the incubator at 37°C.\nRemove frozen NP vials from liquid nitrogen and rapidly thaw at 37°C in a water bath. Clean cryovial with ethanol, then immediately transfer cells by adding dropwise to a 15 mL Falcon tube containing 8 mL of NP culture medium.\nSpin cell suspension in a centrifuge at 200 × g for 3 min at room temperature.\nRemove supernatant completely, taking care not to disturb the cell pellet. Resuspend cells in 1 mL of NP culture medium.",
    "Take the PO-L coated warmed plate containing NP medium out of the incubator and add 1 mL cell suspension dropwise per well of 6-well plate. Move plate gently in crisscross motion to distribute cells evenly in the well.\nPlace the plate in a humidified incubator at 37°C and do not disturb for at 48 h to allow the cells to attach. Repeat the process for each cell line.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2944-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Scale bar: 100 μm.\nOptional: When reviving frozen stocks of NPs, RevitaCell Supplement (1:100 dilution) can be added to the complete NP culture medium at step 1b to improve cell viability during post-thaw recovery.\nCulture and freeze down NPs.\nCulture hESC-derived NPs in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37°C. Change media every day. When culturing NPs, media can be aspirated using a P1000 or vacuum pump system.\nPassage cells once they become 100% confluent.\nCritical: Split NPs at 1:2 or 1:3 ratio, maintaining a high density to promote cell growth and reduce differentiation risk (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nCoat 6-well plates according to the first Preparation step at least 24 h before passaging cells.\nWarm NP culture medium and DPBS at 37°C in a water bath for at least 10 min.\nRemove laminin solution from PO-L coated plate, add NP culture medium (1 mL per well of 6-well plate) and warm the plate in incubator at 37°C.\nRemove media from 6-well plate containing the NPs and wash cells once with DPBS.",
    "Remove DPBS and add Accutase dissociation reagent (1 mL per well of 6-well plate) dropwise to cover surface of well.\nIncubate cells at 37°C for 3–5 min. Gently tap the plate afterwards to dissociate the cells.\nNeutralize Accutase with 3 mL DPBS (1:3 ratio) per well.\nTransfer cell suspension into a 15 mL Falcon tube. Tilt the plate and gently flush any remaining cells from the well with DPBS and collect in Falcon tube.\nSpin cell suspension at 200 × g for 3 min at room temperature.\nRemove supernatant completely, taking care not to disturb the cell pellet.\nResuspend cells in 1 mL NP culture medium.\nTake media-containing pre-warmed PO-L coated plate out of the incubator add 1 mL cell suspension dropwise per well. Move plate in a crisscross motion to distribute cells evenly.\nPlace plate in a humidified incubator at 37°C and do not disturb for 24 h to allow the cells to attach.\nOptional: NPs can be counted at step 2bxi after resuspending cells in NP culture medium. This can be done to maintain the same density across the cultures of different cell lines. Also, NP cultures can be scaled up into T75 PO-L coated flasks. We experienced that Accutase Dissociation Reagent may not be effective in flasks. Below is an alternative dissociation protocol using 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA.\nCritical: A minimum of 5 × 106 cells is required to seed a T75 flask to ensure an appropriate cell density for preventing spontaneous differentiation and promoting cell growth.\nAlternative dissociation protocol for culture flasks using 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA.\nCoat T75 flasks according to the first Preparation step at least 24 h before passaging cells.\nWarm NP culture medium, DPBS and KnockOut Serum Replacement (KOSR) at 37°C in a water bath for at least 10 min.",
    "Remove laminin solution from PO-L coated flask, add 14 mL NP culture medium and warm the flask in incubator at 37°C.\nRemove media from T75 flask containing the NPs and wash cells once with DPBS.\nRemove DPBS and add 2 mL of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA to dissociate the cells.\nIncubate cells at 37°C for 1–3 min. Gently tap the flask afterwards.\nQuench Trypsin-EDTA with 1 mL KOSR, dilute further with 7 mL NP culture medium and transfer the cell suspension into a 15 mL Falcon tube.\nSpin cell suspension at 200 × g for 3 min at 21°C.\nRemove supernatant completely, taking care not to disturb the cell pellet.\nResuspend cells in 1 mL NP culture medium.\nTake NP medium-containing warmed PO-L coated flask out of the incubator and add 1 mL cell suspension to it. Move flask in a crisscross motion to distribute the cells evenly.\nPlace flask in a humidified incubator at 37°C and do not disturb for 24 h to allow the cells to attach.\nTo freeze down NPs, follow dissociation protocol in steps 2biv–x or 2civ–ix without preparing a culture plate or flask.\nPrepare NP freezing medium (1 mL per cryovial) and keep inside the hood at room temperature for at least 30 min.\nResuspend cells in 1 mL NP freezing medium and transfer all the cell suspension into a labelled cryovial.\nPlace cryovial into a freezing chamber at −80°C freezer before transferring to liquid nitrogen 24 h later.\nCritical: Freeze down hESC-derived NPs of each cell line regularly to maintain backup of frozen stocks in case of spontaneous differentiation or contamination during NP culture.\nOptional: The cellular identity of hESC-derived NPs can be confirmed by lineage-specific markers, such as NESTIN and PAX6,5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] through immunofluorescence, immunoblotting or qPCR.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nTerminal differentiation of hESC-derived neural precursors into neurons",

Adjust cell suspension volume with neuronal differentiation medium as per Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] in order to dropwise add 1 mL, 500 μL or 100 μL of cell suspension per well of 6-, 24- or 96-well plate, respectively.\nSeed one 6-well plate per NP line (wild-type line and independent clonal lines of ATG5−/−) for immunoblotting analysis.\nSeed a 24-well plate containing glass coverslips with at least 3 replicates of each cell line for immunofluorescence and TUNEL staining.\nSeed a 96-well plate containing at least 6 replicates of each cell line, for the cytotoxicity assay.\nPlace the plates in a humidified incubator at 37°C and do not disturb for 24 h to allow the cells to attach.\nCulture cells in neuronal differentiation medium for 3–4 weeks (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nChange medium every alternate day using a P1000 pipette (for 6-well or 24- well plate) or a multichannel pipette (for 96-well plate). Tilt the plate and slowly remove 70% of the media from each well of the plate to avoid disrupting the neurons.
