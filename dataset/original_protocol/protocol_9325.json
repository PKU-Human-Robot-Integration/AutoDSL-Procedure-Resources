    "1. Neuron transfection\nCulture embryonic day 18 (E18) rat hippocampal neurons on poly-d-lysine-coated MatTek 35-mm glass-bottom dishes1. On 16-18 days in vitro(DIV), transfect neurons using the Clontech CalPhos Mammalian Transfection Kit. First, replace the culture medium with 1.5 ml Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium[href=http://www.invitrogen.com/site/us/en/home/Products-and-Services/Applications/Cell-Culture/Mammalian-Cell-Culture/Classical_Media/dmem.html] (DMEM) per 35-mm dish 0.5 hour prior to transfection. Save the original culture medium in a sterile 15 ml tube for later (step 1.6) use.\nMix 10 μg pEGFP-N1 plasmid DNA with sterile H2O (Clontech) and 12.4 μl 2 M calcium solution (Clontech) to a total volume of 100 μl.\nAdd the mixture from step 1.2) to 100 μl 2×HBS dropwise while vortexing 2×HBS at medium speed.\nLet the mixture sit at room temperature for 20 minutes and then add the final mixture from step 1.3) into DMEM-incubated neurons.\nPut the neurons back into the 37 °C incubator for 1-1.5 hours.\nRemove the calcium phosphate-containing medium, then wash cells with DMEM three times. Before returning the culture dish to the incubator, exchange the DMEM medium with the original culture medium.\n2. FRAP experiment on a spine\nNeurons are used for the FRAP experiment two to four days after transfection.\nReplace the culture medium from the 35-mm glass-bottom dish, by immediately adding pre-warmed Tyrode Solution, which contains (in mM) NaCl 145, KCl 5, HEPES 10, Glucose 10, Glycine 0.005, CaCl2 2.6, and MgCl2 1.3 (pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH).\nA Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope is used for the FRAP experiment. The Zeiss TempModule system is used to control the temperature (37°C), the humidity and the CO2 (5%) of the working system. Make sure that the CO2 tank is connected and the water bottle, which is used for balancing humidity, is filled with water.",
    "Find a transfected mature dendrite with the 100×objective (αplan-APOCHROMAT 100×/1.46 oil). If the transfected cells in the dish are sparse, search for a desired cell with the 40× objective (plan-NEOFLUAR 40×/1.3 oil), and then switch to the 100× objective to capture images.\nUse 5× optical zoom and a 256×256 pixel resolution to image a short piece of dendrite with several spines. To capture images, use nominal speed 9 (pixel dwell time 3.15 μsec) which takes 0.5 second to finish a scan. The pinhole is set to 2μm to obtain strong fluorescence. When taking images, try to use low laser transmission, for example 1-5 %, to avoid photobleaching the entire image.\nSelect the spine of interest. In our experiment, we choose mushroom spines with their spine head diameters of ~1 μm.\nTo do a FRAP experiment, take 5 control images before bleaching, then bleach the spine of interest 10 times at nominal 100% laser transmission [The argon laser power is 30 mW, with 50% (15 mW) in the 488 laser line, and approximately 3-4 mW reaches the microscope through the 488 laser line], and then capture a series of images immediately after bleaching. For this experiment, images are captured every 1 second for 15 seconds after bleaching. The interval of time should be adjusted according to different targeting proteins and different experimental designs (Fig. 1).\nSave images.\n3. Data analysis\nOpen images with ImageJ software.\nAlign the stack of images using the align tool ('plugins' →'stacks - shuffling' →'align slices in stack' →'translation' and/or 'rigid body') in ImageJ, so that the spine of interest does not float, in other words - it remains in the same position on the image.",
    "Measure relative fluorescence intensity of the spine of interest (Fs), a transfected but unbleached region (control), and a background region (Fb) in time lapse images, using the 'Intensity v Time Monitor' tool of ImageJ ('plugins' →'stacks - shuffling' →'Intensity v Time Monitor'). The control region could be a piece of well-focused distal dendrite. The background region is a non-fluorescent region.\nCalculate the photobleaching rate (r) by comparing the fluorescence of the control region before (Fc0) and after (Fc) photobleaching.\n\tr = Fc/Fc0.\nNormalize the fluorescence intensity of the target spine (F) as follows:\n\tF = (Fs - Fb) / r.\nCurve fit the fluorescence intensity of the target spine with a one-phase exponential equation of Graphpad Prism software (Fig. 2) or other similar software.\nCalculate the mobile fraction (fm) and the immobile fraction (fi) by the following equations:\n\tfm = F∞/ F0, \n\twhere F∞ is the fluorescence intensity after full recovery, and F0 is the fluorescence intensity before photobleaching.\n\tfi = 1 - fm. \n4. Representative Results:\nIn this study, we perform a FRAP experiment on mature hippocampal neurons. At 18-22 DIV, mushroom spines are already formed. Using our method, the dynamic changes of the fluorescence intensity in a small region, such as a spine, can be recorded.\nTo analyze the fluorescence recovery process of EGFP, we take 5 images as controls before bleaching and then 1 image every 1 second immediately after bleaching for 15 seconds. The resolution of the image is sufficent for quantitative analysis. The fluorescence recovery profiles of tagged fluorescence proteins are highly reproducible.\nWe also briefly show how to define the mobile and immobile fractions of a fluorescence protein, using ImageJ and Graphpad Prism software. The FRAP method and analysis we show here can be broadly used in neuroscience, cell biology and other studies.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2568/2568fig1.jpg",

Photographs represent the same area before (Pre) and at 0, 1, 5, 10, 15 seconds after photobleaching. The region of the spine, control and background are marked with letters S, C and B, respectively. Neurons were maintained at 37°C during the experiment. Scale bar, 1 μm.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2568/2568fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. FRAP curves of EGFP fluorescence over a 15-second period. The green line shows the original curve; the red line shows the normalized curve. The dots on curves show the FRAP every 1 second. The curves were fitted by one-phase exponential equations. The average fluorescence before photobleaching was counted as 100%. In this experiment, the mobile fraction (MF) is 94% and the immobile fraction (IF) is 6%."
