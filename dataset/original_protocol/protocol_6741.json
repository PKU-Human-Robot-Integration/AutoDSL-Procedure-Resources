    "Tissue cultureMaintain HK-2 cells (passages 18-30) in DMEM/F-12-containing FCS, EGF and penicillin-streptomycin growth media, which has a high basal glucose concentration (17.5 mM) to encourage cell growth.Seed HK-2 cells on sterile 35 mm fluorodishes at a seeding density of 1 × 104 in 2 ml DMEM/F-12-containing FCS, EGF and penicillin-streptomycin growth media (see Note 1).Prior to treatment, culture HK-2 cells in low (5 mM) glucose DMEM/F-12-containing FCS, EGF and penicillin-streptomycin medium for a period of 48 h, followed by an overnight incubation in serum free low (5 mM) glucose DMEM/F-12-containing EGF and penicillin-streptomycin medium to negate any pre-stimulatory effects from the high (17.5 mM) glucose.After overnight incubation in serum free low (5 mM) glucose DMEM/F-12-containing EGF and penicillin-streptomycin media, treat HK-2 cells with a desired stimulus (e.g., TGF-β1, 10 ng/ml) against control HK-2 cells in serum free low (5 mM) glucose DMEM/F-12-containing EGF and penicillin-streptomycin media for 48 h with a final confluence of 80%.Balanced salt solutions and 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein preparationPrepare 1 L 1× calcium-containing and 1 L 1× calcium-free balanced salt solution (see Recipes) and keep warm at 37 °C in the small water bath.Prepare two adequate carboxyfluorescein solutions (200 µM) in 50 ml Falcon tubes (see Note 2). One in 50 ml 1× calcium-containing balanced salt solution and one in 50 ml 1× calcium-free balanced salt solution (see Note 3). Sonicate both solutions at 44 kHz for 10-20 min (37 °C) until the carboxyfluorescein powder has fully dissolved. Leave the solutions at 37 °C in the water bath and use as needed.Initial rig preparationAs seen in Figure 1, and in this order:Switch on EBX 75 isolated lamp.Switch on tempcontrol 37, adjust the setpoint to 37 °C (real). Allow 20-30 min for the heated stage to reach the desired temperature.Switch on the CoolSNAP HQ CCD monochrome camera.",
    "Switch on Lambda 10-2 optical filter change, ensure light emission at 510 nm on the Axiovert 200 inverted microscope (see Note 4).Remove cover and switch on microscope.Switch on PC, load Metamorph and press ‘acquire’ from the acquire tab at the top of the screen.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3901/bioprotoc-11-03-3901-g001.jpgFigure 1. Axiovert inverted fluorescent microscope rig. A schematic of the inverted fluorescent microscope setup for carboxyfluorescein dye uptake assessment. Mounted on an anti-vibration Metafluor imaging workbench, the inverted fluorescent microscope has an XBO 75 microscope lamp connected to an EBX 75 isolated housing unit, along with a Lambda 10-2 optical filter changer. A heated stage is also fitted and controlled by a tempcontrol 37 unit. Located at the front of the microscope, a coolSNAP HQ CCD monochrome camera is mounted, linked to a power supply and subsequently connected to a PC for image visualisation.Carboxyfluorescein dye uptakeRemove one fluorodish from the humidified incubator and aspirate the media using a Pasteur pipette into a waste pot.To permit hemichannel dye uptake, incubate cells in 2 ml 1× calcium-free carboxyfluorescein solution at 37 °C in a humidified incubator for 10 min (see Note 5).To close the hemichannels, using a Pasteur pipette, remove the 1× calcium-free carboxyfluorescein solution and replace with 2 ml 1× calcium-containing carboxyfluorescein solution at 37 °C in a humidified incubator for 5 min.To remove any residual carboxyfluorescein dye which may interfere with imaging, wash cells carefully using 20 ml pre-warmed 1× calcium-containing balanced salt solution leaving 1-2 ml of 1× calcium-containing balanced salt solution in the fluorodish (see Note 6).Image captureEnsure image capture is completed in a dark environment. To standardise image capture, cells producing the brightest signal (TGF-β1 treated cells) are measured first and exposure opening time is fixed for comparison between treatments.",
    "To fix the exposure time, initially place the cells on the microscope heated stage, turn on the fluorescence (emitted light captured at 510 nm) and set the slider switch to the lens (eye symbol) on the microscope (see Note 7).Locate a cell population producing a bright image, switch the microscope slider to the camera (camera symbol), and using the acquire window in Metamorph, press ‘F2: Show Live’ to visualise cells on the PC screen. Adjust the focus of the image and press ‘AutoExpose’ (Figure 2) (see Note 8).Once the exposure time is set, to reduce photobleaching, set the slider switch back to the lens and efficiently move the fluorodish to locate another isolated cell population for image capture. After this time, set the slider switch to the camera and in Metamorph, press ‘F2: Show Live’, adjust the focus of the image and finally press the ‘Acquire’ button to capture the image (Figure 2) (see Note 9).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3901/bioprotoc-11-03-3901-g002.jpgFigure 2. A representation of the ‘Acquire’ tab in Metamorph V.7.7.5.0. A screenshot of the ‘Acquire’ window to understand the different functions is shown. In order to visualise the cell image on the PC screen, ‘F2: Show Live’/’F2: Stop Live’ should be pressed, followed by either the ‘AutoExpose’ button or the ‘Acquire’ button to capture the live image.Repeat the process until 10-15 images are captured (see Note 10).To save the images in Metamorph, go to:File (located top left of the screen).Setup Sequential File Names…Set the ‘Base Name’ as the condition (i.e., TGF-β1).Set the Image Number starting from 1.Set the number width to 1.Set the ‘Save As Type’ to ‘Metamorph TIFF’.Set ‘If image already exists’ to ‘Skip to end of sequence’.‘Select Directory’ saves the files to a designated folder.On the PC keyboard, use the ‘Control+U’ shortcut to complete this for each image.",
    "Turn off the fluorescence, discard the fluorodish and repeat from Section D (do not alter the exposure time for the remainder of the experiment)."
