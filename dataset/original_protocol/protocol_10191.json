    "hBMSCs were isolated from the femur head of osteoarthritis patients undergoing femur head replacement surgery. The procedure was performed under the approval of the Local Ethics Committee of the University of Wuerzburg and informed consent of the patients. Primary microvascular endothelial cells were isolated from foreskin biopsies of juvenile donors. Their legal representative(s) provided full informed consent in writing. The study was approved by the local ethical board of the University of Wuerzburg (vote 182/10).\n1. Isolation of hBMSCs and HDMECs\nHuman bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hBMSCs)\n\t\nRemove spongy bone from the femur head by using a sterile spoon.\n\t\tNOTE: The spongy bone appears as a loose and granular substance inside the cortical bone, which is hard and rigid. It may be necessary to scratch parts of the spongy bone from the cortical bone by using a scalpel.\nInsert the removed spongy bone in two 50 mL tubes. The volume of the spongy bone can vary from 5 to 10 mL according to the dimension of the removed femur head during the hip replacement surgery.\nWash with DMEM-F12 (1:1 mixture of DMEM and Ham F12 medium), filling the tube with approx. 30 mL of medium.\nShake the tube manually, in a longitudinal way, for 5 s to let adipose cells out of the spongy bone. Centrifuge at 300 x g and 22 °C for 5 min.\nAspirate with a graduated plastic pipette, the fat-cell layer and approx. 20 mL of the remaining supernatant. Let enough medium to cover the spongy bone.\nFill the tubes with 10 ml of DMEM-F12 and shake vigorously longitudinally by hand, for 10 - 15 s, to let the cells out.\nTransfer 10 - 15 mL of cell suspension with a graduated plastic pipette from the tubes to a new 50 mL tube.",
    "Repeat 2 - 3 times from step 1.1.6 pooling together the obtained cell suspension until the spongy bone collected in the 50 mL tube is white.\nTransfer the cell suspension with a graduated plastic pipette to two new tubes, avoiding aspirating the collagen pellet deposited on the bottom of the 50 mL tubes.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 300 x g and 22 °C for 5 min. Discard the supernatant by aspirating it with a graduated plastic pipette.\nAdd 40 mL of DMEM-F12 10% FCS 1% Pen/Strep 50 µg/mL Ascorbate-2-phosphate in a third tube. Transfer 5 mL of this medium to each tube containing the cell pellet. Re-suspend the cell pellets by flickering the bottom of the tubes vigorously and transfer the cell suspensions to the tube containing only medium.\nOPTIONAL: Dilute 100 µL of cells suspension for cell counting, diluting first 1:100 with PBS and then 1:10 in trypan blue, by adding 15 µL of the first dilution to 15 µL of DPBS and 30 µL Trypan Blue to obtain a DPBS: Trypan Blue ratio of 1:1. Count the cells with a standard Neubauer chamber.\nSeed the cells at 109 cells/175 cm2 T-Flask in 25 mL of medium as described in 1.1.11. Alternatively, divide the whole cell suspension in up to ten 175 cm2 cell culture flasks without counting. At this stage, hBMSCs are not distinguishable from the erythrocytes, which greatly outnumber them. hBMSCs will appear as sparse colonies (1 - 2/flask) over the course of the first 7 days.",
    "Change medium after 4 days from seeding to allow interaction of the blood cells with the hBMSCs. After the first medium exchange, change the medium every 2 - 3 days. Perform the medium exchange by completely removing the culture medium with a graduated plastic pipette, washing two times with DPBS (by adding 10 mL of DPBS to the adherent cells and removing completely the DPBS with a graduated plastic pipette) and then adding 20 mL of fresh medium, as described in 1.1.11.\nHuman dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs)\n\t\nTreat the skin biopsies and isolate the HDMECs according to previously published protocols21. Briefly, after separation of dermis from epidermis, incubate the dermis in trypsin for 40 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After incubation time, transfer the dermis to a Petri dish containing culture medium, and scratch each piece with the use of a scalpel. Transfer the obtained cell suspension to a 50 mL plastic tube and centrifuge for 5 min at 300 x g and 22 °C. Count the cell suspension using a Neubauer chamber and seed at a density of 1.2 x 104 cells/cm2. Change the medium completely every other day.\n2. Set-up and sterilization of spinner flasks, RCP microcarriers, and bioreactor\nSpinner flasks and RCP microcarriers\n\t\nOne day before the experiments, set-up the spinner flasks and prepare them for sterilization by autoclave.\n\t\tNOTE: Leave the caps of the spinner flasks loose and, when possible, sterilize them in an upright position.\n\t\t\nWrap the spinner flasks with aluminum foil around the side caps separately in order to avoid contamination during unwrapping. Wrap the flasks with 1 - 2 layers of aluminum foil for autoclaving in order to minimize contamination risks after sterilization.\nWeigh the required amount of RCP macroporous microcarriers in 20 mL of DPBS.",
    "NOTE: 30 mg is required per spinner flask. Let them hydrate for at least 1 h before heat sterilization by autoclave (121 °C for 15 min).\nPerfusion bioreactor\n\t\nUse the bioreactor system described to produce vascularized tissue equivalents20. This bioreactor consists of a vessel, in which the biomatrix is placed, a medium reservoir and a pressure bottle.\n\t\t\nConnect the vessel with the medium reservoir and the pressure bottle through silicon tubes (see Figure 3C). Leave the caps loose and place it in an autoclave plastic bag, close well, and place this in a second autoclave plastic bag. Sterilize by autoclave.\n3. Culture of hBMSCs and HDMECs on RCP macroporous microcarriers\nNOTE: The HDMECs used to seed the RCP microcarriers were labeled with RFP by lentiviral transduction. This protocol was modified after a previously published protocol5.\nLet the RCP macroporous microcarriers settle to the bottom and wash them with 10 mL of culture medium. Repeat 3 times.\nWash spinner flasks with 10 mL of culture medium.\nAdd 30 mg of RCP macroporous microcarriers per spinner flask in 8 mL of culture medium. Equilibrate the spinner flasks containing the RCP microcarriers at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 30 min, before seeding the cells.\n\tNOTE: This is based on approximate dry weight of RCP microcarriers before sterilization.\nSeed 5 x 105 hBMSCs or HDMECs (passage 3) per spinner flask in 2 mL of culture medium.\nPlace the spinner flasks on the stirrer plate and start stirring at 90 rpm for 5 min and rest for 55 min, at 37 °C and 5% CO2, for a total of 1 h static/dynamic incubation. Repeat 4 times.\nAdd 10 mL of cell culture medium per spinner flask and then start continuous stirring at 95 rpm. Incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2.",
    "With the use of a micropipette take samples at days 1, 4 and 7: 333 µL for DNA content (~ 0.5 mg), 1000 µL for SEM analysis (~ 1.5 mg) and 333 µL for live/dead staining (~ 0.5 mg).\n\tNOTE: This is based on approximate dry weight of RCP microcarriers before sterilization.\nChange 10 mL of culture medium every other day. For this, wait until the RCP microcarriers settle to the bottom and very carefully aspirate 10 mL from the spinner flask, with the use of a 10 mL pipette, and then add 10 mL of fresh culture medium.\nKeep the cultures on the stirrer plate set at 95 rpm, at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 7 days.\n4. DNA content, SEM analysis, live dead staining, and sprouting assay\nDNA content\n\t\nWith the use of a micropipette, collect approx. 0.5 mg of microcarriers from each spinner flask (contained in 333 µL of suspension) and transfer to a 2 ml plastic tube.\n\t\tNOTE: This is based on approximate dry weight of RCP microcarriers before sterilization.\nWash once with 1 mL of DPBS, then aspirate supernatant.\nRemove remaining DPBS in a lyophilizer and weight the lyophilized microcarriers for later normalization.\nFreeze samples at -80 °C for at least 6 h.\nIncubate samples at 60 °C overnight with 300 µL papain 5 U/mL.\nEstablish the appropriate titration curves following the manufacturer´s instructions of the quantitation assay (e.g., PicoGreen dsDNA assay) kit and perform measurement of the fluorescent signal at 520 nm with a luminescence detector.\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis\n\t\nCollect ca. 1 mg of microcarriers from each spinner flask and transfer to a 2 mL plastic tube.\nWash microcarriers once with 1 mL of DPBS.\nRemove DPBS and incubate in 1 mL of 70% ethanol for 1 h.",

Keep on ice.\nTake ~0.375 mg of microcarriers (250 µL) with the use of a micropipette. Transfer to a 1.5 mL plastic tube, wait for the RCP microcarriers to settle to the bottom and remove the medium completely.",
    "NOTE: This is based on approximate dry weight of RCP microcarriers before sterilization.\nAdd the volume of NaOH 0.2 N required to neutralize the collagen mixture and immediately mix it with the RCP microcarriers.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Determine the required amount of NaOH 0.2 N in advance by adding it to the mixture until change in pH (turn from yellow color to pink), and then placing the mixture in the incubator for 1 min, after which a gel must be formed.\nPlate the collagen gel-RCP microcarriers mixture in a well of a 24-well plate. Incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 30 min.\nAdd 200 µL of the vascular endothelial growth factor (e.g., VascuLife VEGF-Mv culture medium). Incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nObserve under a inversed phase contrast microscope, using a 10X magnification object, and acquire images.\n5. Biomatrix seeding and start of bioreactor system for HDMECs\nOne day before starting the bioreactor cultures, cut open BioVaSc (the biomatrix) longitudinally on the antimesenteric side and fix it in a previously disinfected polycarbonate frame (see Figure 3A, B).\n\tNOTE: The BioVaSc is a biomatrix obtained from a decellularized porcine jejunal segment, prepared as previously published21.\n\tNOTE: As the polycarbonate frame cannot be sterilized by heat, disinfect it by 20 min incubation in sonic bath (40 kHz) followed by 3 times incubation in ethanol 70% for 25 min. Then, wash the frame 3 times with DPBS sterile.\n\t\nPlace the biomatrix-frame system in a 100 mm Petri dish and fill it with the vascular endothelial growth factor + 1% Penicillin Streptomycin (Pen/Strep).\nEquilibrate the biomatrix by incubating overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2.",
    "After detaching and counting the cells, inject 10 x 107 HDMECs in 1000 µL of culture medium through the preserved vasculature of the biomatrix, with the use of a 2 mL syringe.\n\tNOTE: Inject ~700 µL through the arterial inlet and ~300 µL through the vein outlet.\nIncubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 3 h, to allow cell attachment.\nFill the bioreactor system with 350 mL of the vascular endothelial growth factor + 1% Pen/Strep and incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nPlace the frame inside the vessel of the bioreactor.
