    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nStromal cell isolation\nTiming: 3 h\nStromal cells in lymphoid tissue are bound to the extracellular matrix and form a mesh like network that act as scaffolds for antigen presentation. Lymphocytes are either bound to the stromal cells or loosely interact with this mesh network. This protocol is optimized for the isolation of stromal cells from human tonsils but can also be used on other (human) lymphoid tissue. Here we describe the steps needed to isolate stromal cells from tonsils via enzymatic digestion and enrichment using Percoll™ (Cytiva).\nDiscard the liquid from beaker containing the tonsils.\nAdd ice cold PBS to the beaker and remove any blood cloths from the outside of the tonsils using tweezers and scissors.\nPour ice cold PBS (20–30 mL) in a Petri dish or equivalent container.\nNote: If mass spectroscopy is one of the end goals make sure that the container is not made from Polyethylene. This greatly increases noise in the mass spectrometer. To avoid this completely, a stainless-steel container can be used.\nPlace the metal sieve on top of the petri dish and transfer the tonsils to the sieve. We recommend a regular kitchen sieve.\nCut the tonsils into 1–2 mm slices using tweezers and scissors. (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2791-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Tonsil processing and Percoll gradient\n(A) Tonsils are cut into smaller pieces with scissors on top of the sieve.\n(B) Glass plunger is used to push the tissue fragments through the metal mesh and lymphocytes and smaller tissue fragments are collected in PBS.",
    "(C and D) (C) White connective tissue and some blood cloths that remain after the brown tissue has been forced through the metal sieve (D) After underlaying 21% and 34% Percoll and centrifugation of 300 g for 25 min a faint band containing the stromal cells can be seen on the interface between 21% and 34% Percoll.\nUsing a flattened glass rod, you can push the tissue through the metal sieve (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). Making sure that the light brown colored tissue makes it through. This contains the cells we need. If done correctly, mainly white tissue remains (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nCritical: The brown tissue passes through the metal sieve when moderate force is applied. Overworking the tissue in this step will result in a lot of the connective tissue to be carried over to the subsequent digestion steps. This should be avoided as much as possible as this will lower yield.\nDiscard the residual (white) tissue in the metal sieve.\nUsing a 10 mL serological pipet, you can use some of the cell suspension in the petri dish to wash any remaining tissue that is stuck to the underside of the sieve and transfer it to the Petri dish.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 50 mL Falcon tube (Greiner Bio-One). Make sure you transfer all the tiny debris as this contains the stromal cells. You can add some fresh PBS to acquire all the tiny fragments.\nSpin the suspension in a centrifuge (10 s up to 200 g) to pellet all the tissue fragments. The pellet contains the tissue with the stromal cells. The supernatant will contain all the free-floating lymphocytes.\nRemove the supernatant containing the lymphocytes. The supernatant can be used to isolate lymphocytes if required.",
    "Optional: Underlay lymphocytes with 21% and 80% Percoll™ (Cytiva) and continue at step 20.\nAdd the 3 mL digestion mix (HBSS, 20 mM HEPES, 0.5% FCS, Collagenase type IV (200 U/mL), DNase I (50 μg/mL)) gently mix by pipetting and incubate for 15 min at 37°C.\nTransfer the supernatant (2–3 mL) to a 50 mL Falcon tube on ice containing 20 mL HBSS w/o calcium/magnesium + 20 mM HEPES + 5% FCS + 2 mM EDTA + gentamycin. This should stop any activity of the enzymes in the digestion mix.\nRepeat steps 12 and 13 three times until the tonsil is fully digested, up to 1 h. The last two times 2 mL digestion mix can be added.\nCritical: Be gentle while mixing the tissue fragments and the digestion mix. The mixing is used to add some mechanical stress to the collagen fibers aiding the enzymes. Pipetting to rough will result in killing the cells.\nFilter the cell suspension through a final metal sieve. We recommend a tea sieve containing a fine metal mesh. This will filter out the bigger undigested fragments and spin down at 200 g at 4°C for 6 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 25 mL PBS.\nFilter through a cell strainer (70 μM).\nCarefully underlay with 10–15 mL of 21% Percoll™ [1.03 g/mL] using gravity mode on a pipetboy.\nCarefully underlay with 10–15 mL of 34% Percoll™ [1.045 g/mL] using gravity mode on a pipetboy.\nOptional: Underlay an additional 80% Percoll™ layer to isolate lymphocytes as well.",
    "Critical: The densities used in this protocol do not differ much therefore they mix easily. Take your time when underlaying Percoll density solutions. Underlaying at a slower rate will result in better separation. Slightly angling at the start of underlaying in the 50 mL falcon tube gives more control over the flow rate. When there is no clear (cell) band visible between the 21% and 34% fractions after centrifugation, this generally means the underlaying was performed too fast which mixes the fractions.\nSpin w/o breaks in a swinging bucket centrifuge at 300 g for 25 min at room temperature.\nCollect the stromal cells at the interface between 21% and 34% Percoll™ (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D) using a Pasteur pipette and transfer to a 50 mL falcon tube with 20 mL HBSS w/o calcium/magnesium + 20 mM HEPES + 2 mM EDTA + 5% FCS + gentamycin.\nSpin down at 200 g for 7 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant to remove any residual Percoll™.\nResuspend the pellet in 5 mL FDC medium and count the cells.\nCells are now ready for FDC enrichment (MojoSort or cell sorter).\nNote: Yield will be highly dependent on the size of the tonsils. In general, we get between 105 and 107 cells with a cell viability >80%. Both yield and viability will be highly dependent on the time between surgery and the start of processing. Also, the speed at which the steps above have been performed will influence total yield and viability. Minimizing the time the intact tonsils spend at room temperature will have the biggest effect on yield and viability.\nFDC enrichment using MojoSort\nTiming: 1 h",
    "FDCs are only a small subset of all stromal cells present in lymphoid tissues. CD35 is highly abundant on FDCs but not on other cells in the stromal cell fraction. To further enrich the FDCs, the stromal cell fraction is stained with biotinylated anti-CD35 antibodies. This can then be bound by streptavidin nanobeads (Biolegend) and separated using a strong magnet (MojoSort magnet). This method will suffice for most experiments when culturing FDCs is the goal. All steps are performed at 4°C.\nTransfer cells to a Round-Bottom Polystyrene Tubes (FACS tube) and adjust the total cell amount to a maximum of 1 × 108 cells.\nWash the cells with sort buffer and spin down at 200 g for 5 min.\nAspirate supernatant and resuspend the cell suspension in 100 μL sort buffer.\nFor every 1 × 107 cells add 1 μL biotinylated CD35 antibody and incubate on ice for 15 min.\nWash the cells with 2.5 mL sort buffer spin down at 200 g for 5 min.\nAspirate supernatant and resuspend cells in 100 μL sort buffer.\nResuspend the streptavidin nanobeads (Biolegend) by vortexing at max speed with 5 touches.\nAdd 10 μL of streptavidin nanobeads per 1 × 107 cells of sample.\nIf < 1 × 107 cells, use of 10 μL of nanobeads\nAdjust the volume so that the nanobeads do not exceed 20% of the total volume.\nWash the cells with 2.5 mL sort buffer spin down at 200 g for 5 min.\nResuspend the cells in 2.5 mL sort buffer and place in the MojoSort magnet for 5 min.\nAfter 5 min pour off the unlabeled cells. This fraction can be stored to check the efficiency of the enrichment.",
    "Resuspend the labeled (selected) cells in 2.5 mL sort buffer and place in the MojoSort magnet for 5 min.\nRepeat step 35–36 two more times to a total of three separations.\nResuspend the cells in FDC medium to the desired concentration.\nPlate the cells in collagen and laminin coated wells.\nIncubate at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nNote: Yield should be between 102–104 cells. Some lymphocytes will still be attached to the FDCs at this point hence the purity is hard to monitor. The most important part will be that the FRCs and MRCs are not labeled by CD35 and will be removed in step 35–37.\nNote: If you opt for separation with a cell sorter the magnet sort step should be skipped.\nCritical: The streptavidin nanobeads sediment very quickly, it is therefore essential to properly resuspend and vortex right before use. If this is not done properly you will add too few nanobeads and the cell separation will fail.\nFDC enrichment using Sony MA900 cell sorter\nTiming: 1–3 h\nFDC enrichment via flow cytometric cell sorting. This method allows for more precise separation of FDCs from all the other cell types that are present in the stromal cell fractions but results in lower yields. Continue the protocol from step 24.\nWash the cells with 2.5 mL sort buffer and spin down 200 g for 5 min.\nResuspend the cells in 100 μL sort buffer add the FDC antibody cocktail and incubate on ice for 30 min in the dark. A viability dye will be added later to exclude dead cells.\nWash the cells with 2.5 mL sort buffer and spin down 200 g for 5 min.\nResuspend the cells in sort buffer to a concentration of 3 × 107 cells per mL.",
    "Just before starting the sort add 2.5 μL helix-NP per 1 mL of cell suspension to discriminate live and dead cells.\nSort the cells using a 100 μm nozzle on the Sony MA900 cell sorter (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A for gating strategy). Yield should be around 103–104 FDCs per tonsil pair.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2791-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Expected outcomes for stromal cell FACS and FDC culture\n(A) Gating strategy for stromal cells. This sample was measured after step 24 of the protocol before MojoSort beads enrichment. SSC-Ahigh were selected, then PDPN+, CD31- cells. FDCs were identified with CD35+, CD55+. Data acquisition on Cytoflex LX.\n(B) FDCs isolated using MojoSort magnetic bead isolation after 1 week of culture at 37°Cat 5% CO2. Cells were stained for CD35 and CD55 to identify FDCs. GC B cells are attached to cultured FDC. Dotted line indicates the FDC. Images were taken using a spinning disk confocal (Yokogawa CV7000S) with a 40× objective at 37°C and 5% CO2. CD35-FITC, 488-laser on 30% and 525/50 filter. CD55-APC, 647-laser on 30%, 676/29. Confocal-Brightfield path was used for brightfield acquisition. Scale bar = 20 μm.\nCollect the FDCs in a tube with 1 mL FDC medium at 4°C.\nSpin down the cells at 200 g for 5 min.\nResuspend the cells in FDC medium to the desired concentration. The cells can then be plated in collagen and laminin coated wells and incubate at 37°Cin a 5% CO2 incubator.\nOptional: Cells can be sorted directly in lysis buffer for sequencing or mass spectrometry.\nNote: Other cell sorters can be used when the nozzle is > 100 μm and the pressure below 30psi."
