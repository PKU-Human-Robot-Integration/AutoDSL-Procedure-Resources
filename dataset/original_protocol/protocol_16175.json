    "This protocol describes methods for the efficient derivation of hiPSC-mono in 14 to 15 days, which had been tested and proven robust with multiple hiPSC lines previously (Cao et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-bib-0005]).",
    "Monocyte differentiation from hiPSCs is divided into five steps (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-fig-0001]). The first is seeding and culture of hiPSCs. The seeding density determines the differentiation efficiency so needs to be optimal because higher seeding densities can suppress HPC induction from day 5 to day 9. The second step is mesoderm induction with bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), activin A, and CHIR99021 for 2 days, followed by HE induction for 3 days with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2), SB431542, and stem cell factor (SCF). On day 2 and day 5, the differentiation efficiency can be determined by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) for mesoderm (CD140a+) and HEs (CD144+CD34+CD73-), respectively. The fourth step is hematopoietic induction from day 5 to day 9 using VEGF, FGF2, SCF, interleukin 3 (IL-3), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and thrombopoietin (TPO). The differentiation efficiency can easily be estimated based on the number of round HPCs that emerge or are quantified by FACS for the HPC-specific marker CD43 on day 9. The last step is monocyte induction from HPCs using IL-3, IL-6, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) in suspension culture. On day 9, the round HPCs are collected first before dissociation of adherent cells using TrypLE and Accutase sequentially to minimize cell stress. Large numbers of dead cells and cell debris may lead to unintended monocyte activation. CD14+ monocytes can be harvested and isolated either on day 14 or day 15 depending on differentiation efficiency and/or on the hiPSC line, and optimal time can be determined either by FACS or by observing a small number of cells that start to adhere to the plate and differentiate towards macrophages.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/535e36ba-4ad2-4b0d-924f-b010aecafa65/cpsc108-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1",
    "Timeline of all protocol procedures. Bright-field images of representative cellular morphology are shown for day 0 (undifferentiated hiPSCs), day 2 (mesoderm), day 5 (HE), day 9 (HPCs), day 14 or 15 (monocytes before isolation), and day 21 (M0, M1, and M2 macrophages). FACS analysis of stage-specific markers at day 0, day 2, day 5, day 9, and day 15 of differentiation are shown. Wright-Giemsa staining of hiPSC-mono after isolation at day 15 is also shown. Scale bar represents 200 μm in all bright-filed images and 50 μm in Wright-Giemsa staining. Abbreviations: hiPSCs, human induced pluripotent stem cells; HE, hemogenic endothelium; HPCs, hematopoietic progenitor cells; FACS, fluorescence activated cell sorting; hiPSC-mono, hiPSC-derived monocytes\nExpected results are large numbers of round HPCs forming by day 9 of differentiation and >50% CD14+ monocytes before isolation. More details on expected results are described in the Understanding Results section.\nPart or all of the protocol can be tailored to specific end-user interests. For instance, the differentiation protocol for CD73- HEs from hiPSCs can be useful to study HE development in vitro and the subsequent endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT). HPCs derived from this protocol on day 9 show multilineage differentiation potential in a colony forming unit (CFU) assay, developing to erythroid, myeloid (granulocytes, monocytes, macrophages), and megakaryocyte lineages (Cao et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-bib-0005]). Uenishi and colleagues showed that T lymphoid cells can also be generated from hiPSC-derived HPCs differentiated using a comparable method, even though Tenascin C was used as an extracellular matrix protein to promote lymphoid differentiation (Uenishi et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-bib-0025]). These results suggest that HPCs derived using this protocol can also be used for the induction of other hematopoietic lineages, including granulocytes, erythrocytes, megakaryocytes, and T lymphocytes.\nMaterials\nHuman induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)\n               \nLUMC0020 (LU20, generated from skin fibroblasts; Zhang et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-bib-0031]);",

Add 1 ml GCDR to each well of a 6-well plate and incubate 5 min at room temperature.\nThe timing of GCDR dissociation varies and should be monitored carefully. A prolonged dissociation time may lead to cell detachment.\n5. Aspirate GCDR and add 1 ml TeSR-E8 to each well of a 6-well plate.\n6. Detach cell colonies by scraping them with a cell scraper.\n7. Transfer cell colonies into a 15-ml tube and pipet up and down one to two times gently with a 1-ml pipet.",
    "It is critical to break large pieces of colonies by pipetting to increase their adherence and survival after seeding.\n8. Wash vitronectin-coated plate with 1 ml dilution buffer for each well and add 2 ml TeSR-E8.\n9. Add 33 to 100 µl cell suspension from step 7 into each well (with a splitting ratio 1:10 to 1:30). Distribute cells evenly and place plate with the cells in an incubator at 37°C.\nIt is important to ensure that the cell suspension is well mixed and the cells do not precipitate at the bottom of the tube. Gently tap the bottom of the tube before taking up the cell suspension from the tube.\n10. Refresh cells every day starting 48 hr after passaging of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs).\nMore than 2 ml TeSR-E8 can be added when the cells become relatively dense 5 to 6 days after passaging of the hPSCs.\n11. Passage cells once a week when hiPSC colonies start to contact each other (∼90% confluency).\nPassage hiPSCs for myeloid differentiation\nPassage hiPSCs when they reach 90% confluency, as for the passaging for maintenance.\n12. Prewarm a Matrigel-coated 6-well plate (or use a freshly prepared Matrigel-coated plate) and TeSR-E8 at room temperature for at least 30 min.\n13. Dissociate hiPSC colonies, following steps 2 to 7.\n14. Remove Matrigel and add 2 ml TeSR-E8 in each well of the 6-well plate.\n15. Add 20 to 30 µl cell suspension into each well (with a split ratio 1:33 to 1:50). Distribute cells evenly and place in an incubator at 37°C.",
    "The seeding density of hiPSCs is of essential importance for differentiation efficiency. Too high a density will inhibit the emergence of hematopoietic cells from hemogenic endothelium from day 5 to day 9. When hiPSCs are dissociated from a confluent well, a higher split ratio (1:50) is recommended.\nDifferentiate hiPSCs toward HPCs in 9 days\n16. Mesoderm induction from day 0 to day 2: 24 hr after the passaging from step 15 (day 1), replace TeSR-E8 medium with mesoderm induction medium (2 ml per well). Place plate with the cells into an incubator at 37°C.\nOptimal density of hiPSC colonies on day 0 should be around 30 colonies per well. Always prewarm medium to room temperature and add growth factors to the medium right before refreshing.\n17. Hemogenic endothelium induction from day 2 to 5: On day 2, replace mesoderm induction medium with hemogenic endothelium induction medium (3 ml per well).\nOn day 5, the differentiation efficiency of hemogenic endothelium can be determined by FACS analysis. More than 30% of the total cell population should be CD34+CD144+CD73-.\n18. Hematopoietic induction from day 5 to 9: On day 5, replace hemogenic endothelium induction medium with hematopoietic induction medium. Refresh cell culture on day 7 of differentiation. See Supporting Information Video 1 for the morphology change from day 7 to 9. Time lapse taken from differentiation day 7 to 9 at a frequency of 30 min each frame. The video plays at 10 frames/s. Scale bar represents 200 μm.",
    "On day 5, multiple cell layers should appear in the central area of the colonies while the edges stay as a monolayer. Most colonies have a dark sphere in the middle. Round single hematopoietic cells should start to appear in the central area already from day 7. At first, they will stay attached to the colonies, but as more cells appear, they will partly be released into the supernatant. On day 9, the differentiation efficiency of hematopoietic progenitors can be determined by FACS. More than 50% of CD43+ cells can be obtained on day 9.\nMonocyte induction from HPCs in 5 to 6 days\n19. Prewarm Accutase solution to 37°C.\n20. Gently detach loosely attached HPCs by flushing the colonies with the medium using a 5 ml-pipet. Collect all floating cells and transfer cell suspension into a 50-ml tube.\n21. Wash each well with 1 ml Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) and collect it into the same 50-ml tube from step 20. Add 0.5 ml TrypLE to each well of a 6-well plate and incubate at 37°C for 5 min. Tap plate several times and collect all cell suspension into the same 50-ml tube from step 20.\n22. Add 0.5 ml Accutase solution to each well of the 6-well plate and incubate at 37°C for 5 min.\nThe incubation time needed may vary for different hiPSC lines and seeding densities. Prolonged dissociation (up to 8 min) may be needed to detach most of the colonies. Some cells might remain attached.\n23. Add 1 ml IF9S medium to each well. Scrape off cells using a cell scraper. Collect all cell suspension into the same 50-ml tube from step 20.",
    "Avoid pipetting too vigorously and too often as it could damage the cells. Introducing too many dead cells and cell debris may be toxic and induce the activated phenotype of monocytes.\n24. Add 1 ml IF9S medium to each well. Pipet up and down three to four times to wash off the remaining cells and collect whole cell suspension in the same 50-ml tube from step 20.\n25. Centrifuge cells collected in the 50-ml tube at 1,100 rpm (300 × g) for 3 min at room temperature, then resuspend pellet in 12 ml monocyte induction medium for each 6-well plate used to collect cells.\n26. Distribute cell suspension over twelve wells of a 24-well low-attachment plate, adding 1 ml to each well.\nMix cell suspension well before adding it to the 24-well plate.\n27. Refresh cells on day 12 with monocyte induction medium. To refresh, slowly flip plate 45° and remove 0.5 ml of the old medium from each well using a 5-ml pipet, then add 1 ml fresh medium.\nAvoid disturbing the plate in order to keep all cells at the bottom before refreshing. Aspirate only upper supernatant from the well.\n28. On day 14 or 15, collect all floating cells and perform isolation of CD14+ monocytes as described in Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-prot-0002].\nThe time of harvesting can be either day 14 or 15 depending on each differentiation and hiPSC line. Cells should be collected when a small number of cells start to adhere and differentiate into macrophages. It is highly recommended that the differentiation efficiency is checked by FACS. Efficient monocyte induction should result in >50% of CD14+ cells.\nSample data for Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-prot-0001] are provided in Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-fig-0001].",
    "This protocol describes methods for both isolation and cryopreservation of hiPSC-mono, which have proven robust using at least three hiPSC lines (Cao et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-bib-0005]). CD14 expression can be determined by FACS before monocyte isolation to determine the differentiation efficiency. The isolation should be performed on day 14 to day 15 depending on the differentiation efficiency and adherence of monocytes to the plate. The aim is to get the highest percentage of CD14+ cells before large numbers of adherent monocytes are observed at the time isolation is performed. Expected results are >50% CD14+ monocytes before isolation, with a yield of ∼5 × 106 monocytes after isolation on day 14 or day 15 from each 6-well plate of hiPSCs.

Count total cell number and centrifuge at 1,100 rpm (300 × g) for 3 min at room temperature.\nIt is critical to remove cell clumps by filtering, as they can block the column during magnetic isolation. Total cell number varies per differentiation. Usually 20 to 40 million cells can be collected from one 24-well low-attachment plate.\n5. Discard supernatant and resuspend cells in FACSB (80 µl for every 10 million cells). Then add 50 µl CD14 MicroBeads for every 10 million cells.

Add 1.5 ml FACSB for every 10 million cells. Mix well by flicking the bottom of the tube and spin down at 1,100 rpm (300 × g) for 3 min at room temperature.\n7. Discard supernatant and resuspend cells (up to 40 million) in 500 µl FACSB.\n8. Assemble QuadroMACS Separator according to the manufacturer's instruction. Place LS column in the magnetic field. Wash LS column with 3 ml FACS buffer. Collect fluid into a 15-ml tube.\nThe QuadroMACS Separator is a very strong magnet and should be kept away from all electrical devices.\n9. Wait until the reservoir of the column becomes empty, then add the 500-µl cell suspension into the reservoir. Collect unbound cells into a 15-ml tube.",
    "10. Wait until the reservoir of the column becomes empty. Add 3 ml FACSB into the column to wash off the unbound cells. Collect unbound cells into a 15-ml tube. Repeat washing for another two times (wash column three times in total).\n11. Remove column from the magnetic field and put it on the top of a new 15-ml tube. Add 5 ml FACS buffer to the column. Immediately flush out cells from the column by firmly pushing the plunger into the column.\n12. Count number of cells in the collection tube. Take an aliquot for the characterization of purified monocytes.\nMore than 90% of CD14+ monocytes can be obtained after the isolation step.\n13. Spin down monocytes at 1,100 rpm (300 × g) for 3 min at room temperature.\n14. Cryopreservation of monocytes: Resuspend monocytes in CryoStor® CS10 cryopreservation medium to get a final concentration of 3.75 million/ml. Aliquot 400 µl into each cryovial (1.5 million cells per vial).\nMonocytes and CS10 cryopreservation medium should be kept on ice. Cryovials should also be on ice during aliquoting of cells.\n15. Place all cryovials into a Mr. Frosty™ Freezing Container and leave at −80°C for 24 hr. Then transfer all cryovials into liquid nitrogen for prolonged storage.\nMonocytes can be stored in liquid nitrogen for up to 2 years.",
    "Isolated monocytes are characterized by Wright-Giemsa staining (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-fig-0001]) or FACS (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-fig-0002]). Wright-Giemsa can be used to examine nucleus shape and cell size, and flow cytometry can be used to check for specific surface makers expressed on monocytes. Characterization can be done on either freshly isolated or cryopreserved monocytes after thawing. Cryopreserved hiPSC-mono can be compared with freshly isolated monocytes for the expression of monocyte-specific makers (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-fig-0002]) as well as characterized functionally based on their ability to adhere to hiPSC-derived endothelial cells (hiPSC-ECs) or human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs; Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-fig-0002]-D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-fig-0002]).

    "1b. Place a 100-μm CellTrics filter on the top of a 5-ml FACS tube. Apply monocyte suspension through the filter and wash once with 2 ml FACSB.\n2b. Spin down at 1,100 rpm for 3 min at room temperature.\n3b. Wash cells once by resuspending them in 1 ml FACSB and spin down at 1,100 rpm for 3 min at room temperature.\n4b. Aspirate supernatant but leave around 50 μl inside. Add fluorescent-conjugated FACS antibodies to the cell suspension to the desired working concentration. Suspend cells by flicking the bottom of the tube and incubate in the dark 30 min at 4°C.\nAntibodies used for the characterization of monocytes include those for CD45, CD14, CD11b, and CD18. Fc-R blocking antibody should be added to each tube to reduce non-specific binding of antibodies. Details of all antibodies are listed in the Reagents and Solutions section.\n5b. Turn off the light of the cell culture hood. Wash cell suspension with 1 ml FACSB and centrifuge at 1,100 rpm (300 × g) for 3 min at room temperature.\nStained cells can be analyzed using flow cytometry immediately or fixed with 1% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) and analyzed the next day.\n6b. Analyze samples with a flow cytometer.\nWe used the MACSQuant VYB flow cytometer with the following instrument settings: Blue/488 FITC, A488: 525/50; yellow/561 PE: 586/15; APC: 661/20; APC-Cy7: 750LP. FlowJo software was used for data analysis.\nThe MACSQuant VYB laser setup may require additional compensation between PE and APC channels. For that, extra compensation tubes need to be prepared and run before the analysis. Refer to the manual of the flow cytometer you are using for the setup and compensation procedures.\nSample data of Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-prot-0003] are given in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-fig-0002].",
    "This protocol describes methods for the induction of iPSDMs from freshly isolated or cryopreserved hiPSC-mono, which had been tested and proven robust with multiple hiPSC lines previously (Cao et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-bib-0005]). Cryopreserved hiPSC-mono are thawed and seeded on FBS-coated plates. An example of recovery is 43.2% ± 9.9%. Adherent monocytes are then further differentiated into M0 macrophages in the presence of M-CSF for 4 days in defined IF9S medium. hiPSC-mono (1.5 × 106 cells; one cryovial) are seeded either into four or six wells of a 6-well plate, in order to get a confluent monolayer of M0 macrophages in 4 and 6 days, respectively.\nMacrophages are highly heterogeneous due to the diverse stimuli and immune response induced by local tissue environment; they can be classified as pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages (M1) and anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages (M2; Mantovani et al., 2004[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-bib-0017]; Rőszer, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-bib-0022]). In this protocol, we describe methods for the polarization of M1 using LPS and interferon γ (IFN-γ) or M2 using interleukin 4 (IL-4) for another 48 hr from M0 in IF9S medium. Identities of polarized macrophage subtypes can be examined based on the expression of macrophage-specific markers by FACS (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-fig-0003]). Alternatively, a multiplex cytokine assay can be used to quantify their protein secretion profile. Expected results are ∼90% confluent monolayer of M0 macrophages 4 or 6 days after seeding. With this protocol, a confluent monolayer of polarized M1 and M2 iPSDMs can be derived from thawed hiPSC-mono in 6 days, which could easily provide enough iPSDMs for multiple characterization and functional assays in vitro. More details on expected results are described in the Understanding Results section.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2e65b67c-8ee0-403e-b1d2-93ffd4157b43/cpsc108-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3",

The quality of cryopreserved hiPSC-mono may vary across different batches and hiPSC lines, which could affect their recovery rate and proliferation after thawing. In general, a confluent monolayer of M0 macrophages can still be obtained from a relatively low-quality batch of cryopreserved hiPSC-mono by a longer culture (up to 7 days) or a higher seeding density in M0 medium.\nMaterials\nCryopreserved monocytes (from Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-prot-0002])\nIF9S medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-rec-0015])\nM0 medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-rec-0024])\nM1 medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-rec-0025])\nM2 medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-rec-0026])\nFBS, South America, ultra-low endotoxin (Biowest, cat. no.

Turn on the water bath and set to 37°C.\n2. Take out cryovial with monocytes from liquid nitrogen and thaw in the water bath right away. Transfer all cell suspension in the cryovial into a 15-ml tube that contains 10 ml IF9S medium. Wash cryovial once with medium to collect remaining cells.",
    "The thawing procedure should be performed as quickly as possible to minimize the time monocytes stay in cryopreservation medium. Move the cryovial in the water bath in a circle to thaw. Pipet cells gently to reduce mechanical stress.\n3. Centrifuge the 15-ml tube at 1,100 rpm (300 × g) for 3 min. Discard supernatant.\n4. Resuspend monocytes from each cryovial in 8 ml M0 medium.\n5. Remove FBS from the 6-well plate and add 2 ml cell suspension into each well. Place plate back into the incubator and move plate in a cross-like pattern to distribute cells evenly.\nAlternatively, cells can be seeded into six wells instead of four wells of a 6-well plate so that they become confluent in 6 days, in order to harvest more M0 macrophages at the expense of two additional days of culture.\n6. Refresh cells with M0 medium 2 days post thawing.\nDo not disturb cells during the first 2 days. Only a small number of cells adhere after 2 days (∼10%), which is normal and cells at this stage are still proliferating so that 80% confluency should be reached on day 4 (when starting with four wells of a 6-well plate) or on day 6 (when starting with six wells of a 6-well plate). An additional day may be needed for both starting formats to allow cells to become confluent before starting polarization.\nPolarization of iPSDMs\nPolarization of M1 and M2 from M0 can be performed either in a 6-well plate directly without dissociation or in a 96-well plate for functional assays described in Support Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-prot-0006]. For the polarization in a 96-well plate, M0 are first dissociated and seeded in new 96-well plates.\n7. Two days before the assay, dissociate confluent M0 macrophages with Accutase solution at 37°C for 10 min.",
    "8. Resuspend cells in M0 medium to reach 0.5 × 106 cells/ml.\n9. Seed 50 × 103 cells (in 100 μl) into each well of a 96-well black imaging plate.\nTo obtain enough cells for analysis, seed two wells for each sample of the assay.\n10. Start polarization 24 hr after seeding. Refresh cells with M0, M1, and M2 media, respectively, for polarization of M0, M1, and M2. Polarization lasts overnight (∼12 hr) for functional assays (in 96-well format) and 48 hr for other analysis (in 6-well format).\nIt is critical to reach >80% confluency for M0 macrophages before polarization.",
    "iPSDMs that have been polarized can be characterized by flow cytometry and the multiplex cytokine assay. Flow cytometry can be used to determine specific surface marker expression on each macrophage subtype (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-fig-0003]). The multiplex cytokine assay is used to measure cytokine and chemokine secretion by macrophages. The major factor requiring optimization in this protocol is the dissociation time of polarized iPSDMs for FACS. In some cases, a longer dissociation time (10 to 20 min) may be required to detach iPSDMs from the plate. For the supernatant collected for the multiplex cytokine assay, we recommend diluting three times for the first trial and adjusting it later based on the result. Clear M1 and M2 specific signatures of polarized M1 and M2 macrophages should be observed by both FACS (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-fig-0003]) and multiplex cytokine assay (Cao et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-bib-0005]).\nMaterials\nhiPSC-derived macrophages (iPSDMs) subtypes (from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-prot-0004])\nIF9S medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-rec-0015])\nAccutase-Solution (PromoCell, cat. no.

Add 50 μl cell suspension to each well of iPSDMs. Incubate at 37°C for 1 hr.\n11c. Wash each well of iPSDMs with 100 μl IF9S medium.\n12c. Dissociate iPSDMs with Accutase at 37°C for 10 min. Collect cells from duplicate wells in a 5-ml FACS tube. Wash once with FACSB.\n13c. Stain cells with anti-CD11b fluorescent-conjugated antibody 30 min at 4°C.\n14c. Wash once with FACSB and analyze by flow cytometry immediately to measure the CFSE intensity within the population of CD11b+ iPSDMs.\nTumor phagocytosis assay\nJurkat cells (an immortalized line of human T-lymphocyte cells) are used in this assay as targeted tumor cells to be phagocytosed by iPSDMs. Jurkat cells without anti-CD47 antibody treatment serve as a negative control. Jurkat cells are cultured in Jurkat medium in a T75 flask and passaged every 4 days at a 1:10 ratio.\n1d. On the day of the assay, collect Jurkat cells and count cell number.\n2d. Calculate volume of Jurkat cell suspension needed (200,000 cells per well). Centrifuge at 1,100 rpm (300 × g) for 3 min.",
    "3d. Resuspend cells in 1 ml CFSE working solution (5 μM in PBS, 1 μl in 999 μl, 1/1000 dilution). Incubate at 37°C, 20 min.\n4d. Add 5 ml FACSB-10 to the tube. Aliquot cell suspension into two tubes: One for the negative control without anti-CD47 treatment and the other for the experimental group with anti-CD47 treatment. Centrifuge both tubes at 1,100 rpm (300 × g) for 3 min.\n5d. Suspend cells in both tubes in 50 μl FACSB. Add 3 μl anti-CD47 (3 μg) for every million Jurkat cells in the experimental tube. Leave the negative control tube untreated. Incubate at 4°C, 30 min.\n6d. Wash once with FACSB and resuspend cells in both tubes in IF9S medium to a final concentration of 4 million/ml.\n7d. Add 50 μl cell suspension to each well of iPSDMs. Incubate at 37°C, 2 hr.\n8d. Wash each well of iPSDMs with 100 μl IF9S medium.\n9d. Dissociate iPSDMs with Accutase at 37°C, 10 min. Collect cells from duplicate wells into a 5-ml FACS tube. Wash once with FACSB.\n10d. Stain cells with anti-CD11b fluorescent-conjugated antibody 30 min at 4°C.\n11d. Wash once with FACSB and analyze by flow cytometry right away to measure CFSE intensity within CD11b+ iPSDMs.\nSample data of Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-prot-0002] are presented in Figures 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-fig-0004] and 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.108#cpsc108-fig-0005]."
