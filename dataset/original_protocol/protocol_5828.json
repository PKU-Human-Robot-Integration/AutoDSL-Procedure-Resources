    "Put one male mouse and two female mice into a home cage at 20:00. Detect the presence of Vaginal plug at 8:00 AM next day. If the female mouse has a vaginal plug, the embryonic stage is denoted by 0.5 days (E0.5). Otherwise, divide male and female mice into two home cages and put them into one home cage again at 20:00.Sterilize all metal surgical instruments for 30 min at a station of high temperature (121 °C) and high pressure (0.12 MPa). Disinfect the other nonmetal apparatuses with 75% ethanol.Fill PBS and ampicillin solution into two centrifuge tubes respectively. Keep the tubes in a water bath at 45 °C.Pull a Pipette using a micropipette puller. Break the Pipette tip with scissors to make it open. Fill the Pipette with mineral oil and then fit it in Nanoject II. CTB-555 is inhaled into pipette using Nanoject II.Note: The diameter of the pipette tip is about 50 μm.Anesthetize the pregnant mouse with 1.5% isoflurane in oxygen in a chamber until its respiratory frequency decreases to 60 times per min and then transfer it onto a heat pad at 32 °C controlled by DC temperature controller.Place the head of the pregnant mouse into a face mask to make sure that mouse is anesthetized by 0.5-1% isoflurane in oxygen continuously until respiratory frequency maintains between 80-100 times per min.Shave the mouse abdomen and disinfect successively by using a cotton ball with 75% ethanol and iodophor.Cover the mouse abdomen with a sterile gauze which is cut a 2-cm long slit to expose the position of the abdominal incision.Slit the abdominal skin and peritoneum carefully at the middle of abdomen from outside to inside.Note: Incision at the precise middle of abdomen can avoid capillary vessels.",
    "Otherwise, bleeding induced by damaged capillary vessels is easier to cause wound infection.Pull Embryos out carefully with tweezers and place them on dry sterile gauze over the abdomen.Note: The tension should be slight to avoid tearing uterine wall. Be careful not to damage vessels and placenta.Cut a slit (~1 mm) on the uterine wall over the eyeball of the embryo a slit (~1 mm) using ophthalmic scissors (Video 1).Note: If there are vessels on the uterine wall over the eyeball of the embryo, the embryo is rotated by hand softly to avoid vessels.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. The posture of intravitreous injection One hand holds embryo. Another hand holds Nanoject II. Pipette pass through the slit of uterine wall, eye slide, sclera and then plug it in vitreous chamber. Inject 1 μl CTB-555 into the vitreous chamber of one eye at the speed of 69 nl per time, 1-2 sec interval (Video 1).Notes: One millimeter long pipette tip is inserted subretinally. After injection, the pipette stays in the eye for 5 sec.A second person adds warm PBS using a dropper to the surface of uterine wall to keep it moist throughout the whole process.Resting the arms of the experimentalist on the table helps to prevent disturbance during the injection process. Inject eyes of other embryos successively with the similar volume and speed.Replace the embryos into abdomen carefully with tweezers.Fill the abdomen cavity of the pregnant mouse with 1 ml ampicillin solution to prevent infection. Absorb the extra solution with gauze over the abdomen.Suture the peritoneum and abdominal skin from inside to outside.Apply 1% lidocaine solution on the wound to relieve the pain.Anesthetize the pregnant mouse continually with 0.5-1% isoflurane for 10 h.Note: The pregnant mouse is anesthetized to make the surgical procedure smooth.",
    "After 10 h, anesthetize pregnant mouse with 10% chloral hydrate solution at the dose of 0.06 ml per 10 g weight. Note: The pregnant mouse still has a heartbeat after chloral hydrate solution injection to avoid fetal hypoxia.Cut the abdomen open again to expose embryos. Made a slit on the uterine wall using scissors. Cut the umbilical cord to take out embryo.Fix the embryo on a board and implement heart perfusion using 4% PFA solution.Note: The process of transcardial perfusion of embryos is similar to that of adults. It is best to perform transcardial perfusion under an atomic microscope to reveal the structure of the heart.Take brains of embryos out and fix in 4% PFA for 12-18 h.Note: Retinas of embryos are taken out and fixed in 4% PFA for 2 h. Retinas are mounted on slides and observed with the fluorescence microscope. It is necessary to make sure that majority of retinal ganglion cells are labeled by CTB-555.Dehydrate brains in 30% sucrose.Embed brains in O.C.T after they sink in 30% sucrose solution, and then rapidly transfer into a -80 °C freezer. Half an hour later, take the brains into freezing microtome to rewarm for 20 min.Cut brains into coronal slices of 20 μm thick. Wash the brain slices 5 times (5 min per time) using TBS solution to remove O.C.T away.Note: All brain slices of LGN and SC section are collected.Stain brain slices with DAPI (see Recipe 12) for 7 min, and then wash 5 times with TBS solution (how long each time).Mount brain slices on microscope slides. Apply mounting medium on slices until slices are dry in the air without light. Finally, coverslips are mounted on slices.Take pictures of brain slices under a fluorescence microscope (Figure 1).",
