    "To better mimic in vivo growth of tumor cells, we used a 3D culture system with extracellular matrix protein mixture for tumorspheres development from a single cell. For testing the effect of shRNA-mediated knockdown of a gene of interest on the growth of tumor cells in 3D culture, prepare cells transduced with virus encoding shControl RNA as well as an shRNA specific for a gene of interest.Note: In the text, the words ‘spheroids’ and ‘tumorspheres’ are used as synonyms. Transduction of cells with virus encoding shRNAAt the time of transduction, the confluence of the cells should be about 60-70%. Aspirate the medium, wash the plate with sterile PBS and detach cells with Trypsin. Stop the reaction with media containing FBS, centrifuge (300 x g, room temperature; 2 min) and wash the cell pellet with PBS containing SureEntry reagent. For one transduction, use no more than 50,000 cells. Transduce cancer cells in a sterile Eppendorf tube by direct mixing of virus stock solution with cell pellet, washed previously with sterile PBS (pH 7.4) with SureEntry reagent (the final concentration of SureEntry reagent in PBS should be 8 µg/ml). For transduction, use 10 µl of high titer virus (109 TU/ml) per 50,000 cells.Notes:Before mixing the pellet with virus solution, aspirate the supernatant leaving small amount (~10 µl) of PBS with SureEntry just above the cell pellet. Discard pipettes and vials containing residual amount of virus into a plastic bottle containing 10% Clorox bleach solution.To monitor the efficiency of transduction, control virus can be used (e.g., Mission pLKO.1-puro-CMV-TurboGFP Positive control Transduction Particle, High Titer).Transduction of cells is always performed in a Biological Safety Level (BSL-2) laminar flow hood. Use precautions for bloodborne human pathogens and decontaminate the area with 10% bleach.",
    "Using forceps carefully transfer the open Eppendorf tube containing the transduction mixture (cells and virus) into a 50 ml Falcon tube. Loosen the cap of Falcon tube to allow gas exchange during incubation. Transfer the Falcon tube containing the Eppendorf tube into an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) and incubate for 30 min.Remove cells from the incubator and transfer them to a sterile hood. Add sufficient amount of culture media (2 or 3 ml) and plate the cells into a 6-well plate or 10 cm Petri dishes.Change the medium next day (discard the aspirated medium into a bottle containing 10% bleach). Allow transduced cells to recover for 2-4 days (the time of recovery depends on confluency of cells).Add selection antibiotic at a recommended or pre-tested concentration to get rid of non-transduced cells.Keep selection antibiotic in culture medium for 12-14 days.Test the efficiency of gene knockown in transduced cells with appropriate methods – qPCR (mRNA level) or Western blot (protein level).3D spheroid culture with cells embedded in ECM protein matrix (Matrigel)Note: Although more difficult and time consuming, 3D culture with cells/spheroids embedded in matrix is (in our lab) a preferred method for testing the effect of gene silencing on tumorsphere growth. Growing spheroids embedded in solid or semi-solid protein gel matrix do not have the tendency (or the chance) to clump (Figure 1), which makes quantitative analyses (e.g., counting the number of spheroids or measurement of spheroid diameter) difficult.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180531/20180531193132_0699.jpgFigure 1. Tumorspheres cultured in CSC media only (left panel, A) or embedded in Matrigel matrix (right panel, B). Note the tendency of tumorspheres to clump when grown in CSC media only. Scale bars represent 50 µm.Detach cells from 2D plates using Trypsin or other detachment solution for cells.",
    "Stop the reaction with media containing FBS and transfer cells from the plate into a 15 ml Falcon tube. Pellet the cells by centrifugation (2 min, 400 x g) at room temperature.Aspirate the supernatant and re-suspend the cell pellet in sterile PBS. Filter cell suspension with a 70 µm cell filter and count the number of cells manually or using automated cell counter.Note: The number of cells plated per well must be empirically determined for every type of cancer cells. We recommend starting with 5,000 cells/well (24-well plate) or 10,000 cells/well (6-well plate) and adjusting the cell number as needed (toward lower number of cells per well).Spin down the cells by centrifugation (2 min, 400 x g) at room temperature.Aspirate the supernatant and re-suspend the cell pellet in sterile culture media (abbreviated here as CSC medium) and place the Falcon tube with cells on ice to chill down.Pipet ice-cold CSC culture media up-and-down several times to chill the plastic pipette.Pipette ice-cold Growth Factor Reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences, USA) or Cultrex Reduced Growth Factor Basement Membrane Extract, PathClear (Trevigen, USA) on ice. With chilled pipette, transfer Matrigel into the vial containing ice-cold culture media and cells. Use at least 1:3 ratio (1 part of Matrigel with 3 parts of ice-cold media with cells).Mix gently, avoid making bubbles.Plate the mixture on an ultra-low attachment surface culture plate (Corning, USA) and transfer to the incubator. Next day, gently add CSC culture media to cover solidified matrix:media with cells. Add fresh media every 3-5 days. Note: Aspirate the old media with pipette, not with the vacuum pump (there is a risk of aspiration of Matrigel with spheroids). 3D spheroid culture (basic, without ECM protein matrix)Pellet cells by centrifugation at 300 x g for 2 min (at room temperature) and aspirate the supernatant.",
    "Mix cell pellet gently with medium (abbreviated here as CSC medium) and plate cells into an ultra-low attachment plate.Note: The number of cells plated per well must be empirically determined for every type of cancer cells. We typically prepare several wells (with serially diluted cells) to find the concentration of cells that can be easily imaged without problems associated with higher-than-optimal density of cells (clumping, too dense spheroids, etc.).We recommend starting with 5,000 cells/well (24-well plate) or 10,000 cells/well (6-well plate) and adjusting the cell number as needed.Media replenishment can be performed either by adding extra fresh media (this is preferred in first 2-7 days after cell plating during the time spheres are formed) or by changing media completely. To change the media completely, collect the floating cells from the well and centrifuge at 300 x g, for 2 min. Aspirate the supernatant carefully (cell pellet is sometimes not visible, so leaving small amount of media above the pellet is recommended) and add fresh CSC medium. Mix gently and transfer the cells back to the plate.Monitor tumorsphere formation daily. Sometimes, cells or spheroids have the tendency to clump in the center of the plate (this is caused by micro vibration of cell culture incubator). In this case, re-suspend the tumorspheres gently by tapping the plate, or mechanically using serological pipettes (in the sterile hood).Establishing a new primary 3D spheroid culture line from human tumor tissue Note: Before performing an experiment, make sure to obtain an informed consent letter from each patient which acknowledges the use of residual tumor tissue for research. All procedures that involve research with human tumor tissues must be approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB). All collected tissues must be de-identified.",
    "Transfer the native tumor sample from the hospital in sterile PBS or culture media or (the best option) in Hibernation medium (Hibernate®-A, Gibco, Invitrogen), supplemented with Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Gibco, Invitrogen), on ice.Note: Tumor samples should be as fresh as possible – the ideal situation is to receive/transfer freshly isolated tumor tissue directly from the surgery room – however, in most cases, the tissue used in experiment is residual (leftover) tissue provided by pathologist.Wash 2 x or 3 x with sterile PBS supplemented with Antibiotic-Antimycotic (100x) (Gibco Invitrogen). Perform final wash with PBS without antibiotics.Cut the tumor sample with a surgical blade (Figure 2) into small pieces (1-3 mm) and transfer them into a Falcon tube with ~1 ml of 0.5-1% solution of Collagenase IV (Sigma-Aldrich). Sometimes, collagenase digestion is ‘too strong’ – it is important to monitor sample digestion (take a small portion of the tissue sample in collagenase every 15 min of digestion at 37 °C and check the viability of cells with Trypan blue and TC20 Automated cell counter (Bio-Rad) or equivalent method).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180531/20180531194501_9450.jpgFigure 2. Scheme of tumor tissue processingAdd sterile PBS to the Falcon tube with the tissue sample to wash out the collagenase by centrifugation (200-500 x g, 3 min, room temperature).Re-suspend the pellet with sterile PBS and filter cells with 70 µm cell filter. Count cells.Re-suspend filtered primary cells with i) CSC media or ii) ice cold CSC media mixed with Matrigel (1:3) and plate into Ultra low attachment plates. Use up to 0.5 x 106 cells per well (for 6-well plate).Monitor the growth of spheroids every day. Add small amount of fresh media every 3 days without disturbing the solid phase with embedded cells. Once spheroids are formed, passage them as described below.Notes: Sometimes it is difficult to establish 3D culture in serum-free media.",
    "We recommend preparing one or two wells with cells cultured in CSC media, supplemented with 1% FBS.Freshly digested tumor tissue can be also used for establishing cancer cell lines for 2D growth. In that case, treat the tumor tissue with collagenase as described above. Once digested, wash collagenase with sterile PBS and without filtration the cells, re-suspend tissue fragments/cells in media containing DMEM/F12, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin , and 10% FBS). Plate into a Petri dish or 6-well plate. Change the medium next day to get rid of unattached (dead) cells and debris.Note: For 2D cell line generation, we do not pass cells through a cell filter – it is better to seed them in clumps and with the ‘trash’ and wash the unattached cells and debris next day when changing the media. Passaging the spheroidsAspirate the media from the plate carefully with the pipette, not vacuum aspirator. Try not to disturb the spheroids in Matrigel.Collect the Matrigel with embedded spheroids with a 10 ml pipette and transfer it into a fresh 15 ml or 50 ml Falcon Tube (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180531/20180531194957_6771.jpgFigure 3. Scheme of procedure for tumorspheres passagingAdd 10 ml of Dispase (1 U/ml, StemCell Technologies, Canada) and place the tube into an incubator (37 °C) for 30-60 min. Tap the tube gently several times during digestion.Once spheroids settle at the bottom of the tube, stop the reaction with 100 µl of 0.5 M EDTA (Gibco, Life Technologies, USA) for final EDTA concentration = 0.005 M and centrifuge (1 min, 300 x g, room temperature).Discard the supernatant carefully and add 10 ml of sterile PBS to wash. Centrifuge for 1 min (300 x g) and repeat 2 x.",
    "Note: At this point, pelleted tumorspheres can be used for further expansion in Matrigel, isolation of RNA (for qPCR), or preparation of protein lysates for Western blot.Discard the PBS leaving just a little bit above the pellet containing tumorspheres and add 5 ml of Accutase (StemCell Technologies, Canada). Do not close the Falcon tube tightly to allow gas exchange inside the incubator. Place the tube in the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) and monitor the enzyme reaction. Note: To monitor the enzyme reaction, pipette spheroids several times up and down with 10 ml serological pipette. Properly digested spheroids can be easily re-suspended into single cells. To prepare single cell suspension, re-suspend pellet from digested spheroid with 5 ml serological pipette. Add sterile PBS to wash and centrifuge (300 x g, 2 min, room temperature). Repeat 2 x.Note: At this point, cells can be used for further expansion in Matrigel, FACS analysis, isolation of RNA (for qPCR), or proteins for Western blot. Cryopreservation of tumorspheresTumorspheres could be cryopreserved in the form of single cell suspension (prepared with Dispase-Accutase treatment) or tumorspheres (Dispase treatment only).Mix either single cells (0.5 x 106 to 2 x 106) or tumorspheres (tumorspheres from one well from 6-well plate per one cryovial) with fresh CSC culture media (final volume = 1 ml) containing 10% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), and place the cryovials immediately into Mr. Frosty Freezing Container (Thermo Scientific). Transfer Mr. Frosty into a -80 °C freezer. Next day, transfer vials with frozen tumorspheres/cells into liquid nitrogen storage tank. Use the vapor phase for long storage of tumorspheres/cells."
