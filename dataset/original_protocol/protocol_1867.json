    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSUMOylation test: Prepare seedlings and DEX treatment\nTiming: ∼12–13 days\nIn the following section, we will describe on how to prepare the plant material for the protein extraction.\nSterilize the T2 seeds of pLhGR>>CrINDK124R:3×FLAG using the aforementioned methods.\nScreen the seeds on selection MS medium containing 25 mg/L DL-phosphinothricin, 200 mg/L Cefotaxime and 10 μM GA3.\nPut the seeds evenly on the medium and store the seeds in dark at 4°C for 24–48 h for stratification.\nTransfer the seeds into the growth room under long-day (16 h light/8 h dark) conditions at 22°C for 12 days, the seeds are normally germinated in ∼24–48 h (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1460-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG beads. Immunoblots were probed with anti-FLAG or anti-SUMO1 antibodies. The SUMOylation of the protein were seen as a protein band with higher molecular weight using anti-SUMO1 antibodies and such a band was diminished by K124R mutation. Scale bar in (A) represents 1 cm.",
    "Put 100 μL 10 mM DEX into 100 ml DEX treatment MS liquid medium. Set a mock experiment by putting 100 μL 100% ethanol into the DEX treatment MS medium.\nCollect the 10-day-old seedlings (∼500 individuals per treatment) and put them into the DEX MS liquid medium and DEX mock MS liquid medium, respectively (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). Fix the flasks on the shaker, grow the seedlings at 80 rpm in the growth room under long-day (16 h light/8 h dark) conditions at 22°C for ∼12–16 h.\nSUMOylation test: Total protein extraction from seedlings\nTiming: ∼2.5 h\nIn the following section, we will describe the details on how to extract the total proteins from the DEX-induced seedlings.\nDilute 10× PBS buffer to 1× PBS buffer with sterilized ddH2O and add 37% formaldehyde to a final concentration of 1% to make the 100 mL fixative buffer.\nNote: Fixative must be freshly prepared. Seal the fixative after the preparation since formaldehyde is toxic and evaporative.\nHarvest the DEX-treated seedlings, wrap the sample in a single layer of miracloth and cross-link the proteins in the fixing buffer using 50 mL beaker under vacuum (minimum to 100 mbar) for 15 min. Release the vacuum slowly to avoid any damage to plant tissues.\nNote: As the SUMOylation is a reversible and highly dynamic process in the cell, we recommend fix the proteins using 1% formaldehyde under vacuum for 15 min.\nStop the fixing process by adding 6.25 mL 2 M Glycine to a final concentration of 125 mM under vacuum for another 5 min.\nRinse the sample 3 times with ddH2O, dry the sample with lab tissues and weigh the sample.\nNote: As paraformaldehyde is toxic and evaporative, wear a mask and change the buffers in the fume hood.",
    "Pre-cool the mortar, pestle, 15 mL falcon tubes and spatula in liquid nitrogen until they are completely cooled down.\nGrind the sample (∼1.0 g) in liquid nitrogen ∼2–3 times using mortar and pestle into fine powder (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nCritical: Grind the sample as much as you can, the finer the powder more protein will be extracted.\nTransfer the sample powder to the cooled conical tube (15 mL) using the pre-cooled spatula.\nAdd 2.5×V (2.5 mL) protein extraction buffer into the samples.\nCritical: NEM in the protein extraction buffer is absolutely necessary for a successful SUMOylation test as it dramatically inhibits the SUMO protease activity.\nGently invert the tube to mix the sample powder with the protein extraction buffer.\nFix the tubes on the rotator and extract the protein at a speed of 40 rpm for 1 h at 4°C (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nPre-cool the centrifuge at 4°C when extracting the proteins.\nCentrifugate the samples at ～15,000 rcf (g) and 4°C for 10 min.\nCollect the supernatant and split it into two 2.0 mL eppendorf tubes (∼1.5 mL/each) on ice.\nCentrifugate the samples again at ～15,000 rcf (g) and 4°C for 5 min.\nTransfer the supernatant to new 2.0 mL eppendorf tube on ice.\nNote: Repeat step 19 and 20 until the supernatant is clear.\nCritical: Always perform step 14–21 on ice as low temperature is critical to protect the proteins from degradation.\nTake 50 μL of lysate as input and add 50 μL of 2× SDS loading buffer, boil the sample at 100°C for 5 min.\nNote: Open the tube lid carefully after boiling.\nStore the input samples at −20°C.\nSUMOylation test: Immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 beads\nTiming: ∼4 h\nIn this section, we will introduce the details of recombinant protein immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG M2 magnetic beads.",
    "Wash the anti-FLAG M2 magnetic beads (20 μL/g sample) ∼3 times with 1 mL IP wash buffer. For each wash, rotate the samples with a speed of 40 rpm for 5 min at 4°C.\nNote: Mix the anti-FLAG M2 magnetic beads gently before use. A magnetic rack is required for collecting the beads after each wash. Between each wash, please keep the samples on the magnetic rack for ∼2–3 min at 4°C to allow complete collection of the beads (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nResuspend the anti-FLAG M2 magnetic beads with 50 μL IP wash buffer per tube. Add 50 μL beads into the lysate of each eppendorf tube, mix the samples on a rotator with a speed of 40 rpm for ∼2–3 h at 4°C.\nCollect the anti-FLAG M2 magnetic beads with the magnetic rack. Discard the lysate and wash the beads ∼4 times using 1 mL IP washing buffer. For each wash, keep rotating the samples at a speed of 40 rpm at 4°C for 5 min.\nNote: Between each wash, please keep the samples on the magnetic for ∼2–3 min at 4°C to allow complete collection of the beads.\nAdd 50 μL of 2× SDS loading buffer, boil the beads at 100°C for 10 min, mix the sample from the same genotype, a total of 100 μL IP protein are collected.\nStore the IP samples at −20°C.\nSUMOylation test: SDS-PAGE separation of proteins and membrane transfer\nTiming: ∼3.5 h\nIn this section, we are going to introduce the detailed protocol on how to separate the proteins and transfer the protein onto the PVDF membrane for western-blot.\nPut two SDS-PAGE gels (each SDS-PAGE contains a 5% stacking gel and a 10% separation gel) in the protein electrophoresis system.",
    "Note: The SDS-PAGE gels should be prepared in fresh; we don’t recommend using commercial pre-made SDS-PAGE gels for this SUMOylation test protocol.\nLoad 10 μL IP protein sample, 5 μL input sample and 2.5 μL protein marker into the SDS-PAGE gels.\nSDS-PAGE electrophoresis at the voltage of 90 V for 1.5 h at room temperature.\nNote: The 1× SDS running buffer should be fresh-prepared and single use.\nCut the PVDF membrane and filter pater into 6.0 cm × 8.5 cm in size, rinse the membrane with 100% methanol for 2 min in a square petri dish, then gently remove the methanol and decant 1× transfer buffer (pre-cooled) in the petri dish.\nCarefully collect the SDS-PAGE gels and put them into 1× transfer buffer (pre-cooled) in a square petri dish.\nSoak sponge pad, filter paper in the 1× transfer buffer (pre-cooled).\nMake the gel-membrane transfer sandwich in the clump (negative charge-sponge pad-filter paper-SDS-PAGE gel-PVDF membrane-filter paper-sponge pad-positive charge).\nNote: Care should be taken when putting the PVDF membrane onto the SDS-PAGE gel.\nCritical: Avoid bubbles between the SDS-PAGE gel and PVDF membrane. The bubbles could be avoided by flushing the gel with 1× transfer buffer before adding the PVDF membrane. Also, be sure that the gel and membrane are in order with the charge.\nTransfer the proteins onto the PVDF membrane by electrophoresis at the voltage of 100 V for ∼1.5–2 h at 4°C.\nCritical: Be sure that the transfer buffer is always in cold environment. Carry out this process in the cold room or in the fridge. Also, a pre-cooled (−20°C) ice rack is recommended to put into the electrophoresis tank.\nSUMOylation test: Western blot\nTiming: ∼16 h\nIn the following section, we will provide the details on how to detect the protein SUMOylation using anti-SUMO1 antibodies by western blot.",
    "Collect the membrane in small WB incubation boxes and decant 10 mL 5% non-fat milk blocking buffer in each box, keep on the shaker at 4°C for 2 h (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G).\nNote: Check the color of the biggest protein marker on the membrane as an indication of protein transfer efficiency.\nCritical: Blocking for 2 h at 4°C is enough to reduce the unspecific backgrounds.\nRemove the blocking buffer and add another 5 mL 5% non-fat milk blocking buffer. Dilute the antibody in the blocking buffer, 1:1,000 for anti-SUMO1 and 1:5,000 for anti-FLAG-HRP. Keep on the shaker at 4°C for ∼12–15 h.\nNote: anti-FLAG antibody could also be used in the step, the concentration, incubation time, temperature and secondary antibodies can be adjusted following the instructions of the anit-FLAG antibody.\nCritical: Aliquot the antibodies upon its arrival, keep the aliquots at −20°C and avoid repeated freezing and thawing.\nRemove the primary antibody solution completely and rinse the membrane with the 1× TBST buffer three times, with 5 min each time on the shaker at 4°C.\nNote: The primary antibody solution can be reused in ∼3–4 times and keep in −20°C.\nCritical: Remove the primary antibody completely after each wash using a pipette, residual primary antibody on the membrane will generate high back-ground signals.\nDecant 5 mL secondary antibody (1:10,000 anti-rabbit IgG in 5% non-fat milk blocking buffer) into the WB incubation box. Keep on the shaker at 4°C for 2 h\nNote: The anti-FLAG antibody has already conjugated with HRP, this step can be passed for the anti-FLAG membrane and directly go to step 39.\nRemove the secondary antibody solution completely and rinse the membrane with the 1× TBST buffer three times, 5 min each time on the shaker at 4°C.",
    "Note: The secondary antibody solution can be reused in ∼5–6 times and keep in −20°C.\nCritical: Remove the secondary antibody completely after each wash using a pipette, residual secondary antibody on the membrane will generate high back-ground signals.\nAdd 200 μL Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate mixture (ThermoFisher, follow the manufactures instructions, https://assets.thermofisher.cn/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/MAN0011536_Pierce_ECL_West_Blot_Subs_UG.pdf[href=https://assets.thermofisher.cn/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/MAN0011536_Pierce_ECL_West_Blot_Subs_UG.pdf]) evenly on the membrane.\nExpose the signal onto a film (Kodak) using a chemiluminescence reaction system.\nNote: For the anti-FLAG membrane, the explosion time normally takes ∼1 min to produce a desirable signal. For the anti-SUMO1 membrane, the input sample normally need ∼30 s to 1 min to generate the signal and the IP sample may take longer (∼15 min)."
