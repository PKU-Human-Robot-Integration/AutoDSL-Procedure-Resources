Here, we describe the procedures used for the main sleep session in Experiment 1 in the previous study (Tamaki et al., 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib37]), in order of the timeline. Subjects were trained for a visual perceptual learning task, and then simultaneous MRS and PSG experiments were initiated. See our previous study (Tamaki et al., 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib37]) for details of the procedures for the visual task.\nBefore the sleep session, there were several behavioral sessions (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) where a standard texture discrimination task (TDT) was used.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1200-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. The experimental design used in the Experiment 1 in our previous study (Tamaki et al., 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib37])\nThe numbers in the white box (1, 2, 3 and 4) represent test sessions of the texture discrimination task (TDT), which is a standard visual perceptual learning task, and colored boxes represent training of the TDT.\nPrior to test sessions, sleepiness was measured both by the Stanford sleepiness scale (SSS) (Hoddes et al., 1972[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15], 1973[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]) and psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) (Dinges and Powell, 1985[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Sleepiness tests were used to test whether performance and sleepiness were correlated. Thus, PVT and SSS were administered 4 times in total.\nThe SSS was completed on a computer, coded in MATLAB.\nThe PVT was performed on a computer and was implemented with open-source Psychology Experiment Building Language (PEBL) software (Dinges and Powell, 1985[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).",
    "After Test #2, the electrodes for PSG were attached to the subjects, using an MRI-compatible PSG cap (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). When a 32-channel PSG cap was used, 23 electrodes were used for EEG, 2 electrodes were used for horizontal EOG, 2 electrodes were used for vertical left EOG, 2 electrodes were used for vertical right EOG, 2 electrodes were used for EMG (the mentum), and 1 electrode was used for ECG to the lower shoulder blade. The electrode configurations were customized for our study. See Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nEEG and ECG signals were referenced to the Fz electrode. Electrode impedances were kept at or below approximately 5 kΩ for EEG and ECG\nThe ground electrode was placed at AF4. Electrode impedances were kept approximately at approximately 10 kΩ for EOG and EMG\nAll data were recorded using an MRI-compatible amplifier (BrainAmp MR, Brain Products GmbH, Gilching, Germany), an MRI-compatible battery (Powerpack, Brain Products GmbH, Gilching, Germany) and a recording software (BrainVision Recorder, Brain Products GmbH, Gilching, Germany) at a sampling rate of 5000 Hz.\nNote: The electrodes for the reference and ground were placed in the MRI-compatible PSG cap. Avoide the Cz position referencing or grounding because it is easy for it to become detached from the head.",
    "Note: In our experience, the good impedance level of electrodes remains for 2 h. Thus, we recommend to make sure that all the electrodes are within the acceptable levels of impedance before the MRS scan starts. Once the concurrent MRS and PSG scan starts, it is impossible to check or fix impedance levels of electrodes, unless the concurrent MRS and PSG scan is stopped. This is because the PSG recording software needs to be switched to the impedance measurement mode. If PSG is stopped, we would also have to stop the MRS scan, otherwise the MRS scan would occur without concurrent PSG recording.\nPart 2. Instruction regarding when to sleep\nTiming: 5 min\nThis part started after electrodes were attached but before subjects entered the MRI gantry.\nNote: Instructions regarding sleeping are important. In our design, turning the lights off served as a signal for the start of the sleep session. Thus, we needed to convey this information to subjects. However, at the same time, we do not want subjects to feel pressured to sleep, as such obligatory feelings may actually bother sleep onset.\nInstruct the subjects when to sleep.\nTell the subjects that they should feel free to fall asleep after lights are off following completion of PSG preparation.\nTell the subjects to remain awake as much as possible before lights-off even if they felt sleepy because the period of wakefulness is required to be measured by MRS for subsequent normalization. In addition, in this way, the vigilance level at the start of the sleep session could be consistent across subjects. See Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].",
    "Critical: We did not give strong or definitive instructions in a way that may have caused the subjects to feel pressured. Do not use demanding instructions, including “you need to fall asleep”, “please sleep deeply” or “we need high-quality sleep data”.\nPart 3: A sleep session with repetitive MRS scans\nTiming: 120 min\nNote: A sleep (nap) session was conducted in the early afternoon. Subjects were scanned using a 3T Siemens Prisma scanner (Siemens) with a 64-channel head coil.\nPart 3 describes the procedure after subjects entered the MRI room, with the PSG cap placed on their heads. See Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nPlace the subject on the patient table of the MRI scanner.\nHave the subject lay down with their heads fixed with thin pillows/gauze.\nNote: The starting time of the sleep session was fixed in the early afternoon (around 1–2 pm) across subjects. We recruited subjects who were not extreme morning or evening type and wake up at a consistent time regularly, based on information reflected in questionnaires including the MCTQ.\nCritical: The electrodes placed around the occipital region may hurt the participants as the scanning time goes by, due to the pressure from the occipital electrodes to the inion. It is important for subjects to sleep without discomfort and head motion during the MRI measurements. Thus, good protection around the back of the head is key for successful long scans during sleep sessions. Place cotton around the occipital electrodes so that the head weight would not be concentrated on these particular electrodes.\nStabilize subjects’ heads with cushions and gauze, and ensure that there would be no space left between subjects’ heads and the head coil to reduce head motion.",
    "Use a thin back cushion and knee cushion upon the subjects’ request. Use several blankets to keep the subjects warm and to initiate sleep during the scan.\nCritical: Instructions to keep subjects’ head still throughout the scan are important. Unlike postprocessing for functional magnetic resonance imaging, motion correction was not possible for MRS data analysis. This lack of motion correction posed the possibility that the data would be unusable when a large amount of head motion occurred. Thus, careful instructions for participants to keep their heads still is extremely important. Some of the instructions we provide informed participants that the data may not be usable if they moved their heads even slightly to the left or right.\nNote: Head motion is a serious problem which leads to unusable data. It may be a good idea to add a mock-scanner training to reduce head motion by giving feedback to subjects when head motion is detected (Epstein et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]) prior to the sleep experiments with simultaneous MRS and PSG. However, the mock-scanner training may increase the alertness of the subjects and make it more difficult for them to fall asleep. Thus, we would need to investigate whether the mock-scanner training impacts the quality of sleep. Another possibility for motion correction for PSG recording taken in the MRI environment may be to use a carbon-wire loop based artifact correction (van der Meer et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib39]).\nCritical: The electrode cords must not form loops, as this could have led to heating and damage to the electrodes.\nAfter moving a subject to the inside of the MRI bore, connect the PSG cap to the MRI-compatible amplifier via the flat cable inside the MRI bore (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1200-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Illustration for the setup of PSG system inside the MRI bore",
    "A shorter flat cable reduces artifacts in the PSG recording.\nPull the bundle of electrodes from the PSG cap out from the hollow of the head coil.\nLay out the bundle of electrodes and the flat cable as straight as possible to reduce the artifacts in the PSG data.\nPlace the MRI-compatible amplifier on a stack of paper in the MRI bore (just outside the head coil) so that the height of the flat cable from the amplifier would be at the same height as the bundle of electrodes.\nPlace the MRI-safe battery for the amplifier above the amplifier.\nPlace a heavy sandbag on the MRI-safe battery to stabilize the tower of amplifier and battery.\nPlace another stack of paper on to the plastic case that was on a folded bed sheet to lift up the line of the electrode bundle, the connector and the flat cable and to stabilize the plastic case.\nStabilize the bundle of electrodes further by pieces of surgical tape attached to the stack of paper.\nProvide instructions again, while the experimenter is looking the subjects in the eyes through a mirror attached to the coil, reaffirming that it is important that participants keep their heads still and reiterating the meaning of lights being turned off.\nExamples of instructions: “How are you? This is the last moment you can move, so please try to find a position where you find comfortable without moving your head…. I’m going to check the PSG recording; I’ll be right back.”\nTest the impedance value of each electrode again, as placing and fixing the subjects’ heads in the head coil might move the electrodes.",
    "If the impedance of electrodes is all OK, give the instructions regarding the lights being turned off and keeping their heads still. For example, “Everything looks fine, so we will start the scan shortly. During the scan please try not to move as much as possible. When we start the main scan, we will turn the lights off, and this is the signal for you to take a nap. Do you have any questions? When you have a question or when you want to talk to us, please do not hesitate to squeeze the ball. Have a great nap!”\nIf an unacceptable amount of impedance is noted, the subject should be pulled off from the bore, and the problematic electrodes should be fixed. Most of the time, the problem is that an electrode is slightly shifted or moved up. Adding more EEG gel and fixing the electrode by a piece of surgical tape suffices.\nMRI procedures before MRS\nScout: quick anatomical scan (one slice each for sagittal, horizontal and transverse orientations; slice thickness 7 mm, TR = 8.6 ms, TE = 4.0 ms, flip angle 20°, FoV = 280 mm).\nCollect high-resolution anatomical images by an MPRAGE sequence (256 slices, voxel size = 1 × 1 × 1 mm, 0 mm slice gap, TR = 1900 ms, TE = 3.02 ms, flip angle = 9°, FoV = 256 mm) and use them for localization of the voxel of interest (VOI) for the subsequent MRS sequences.",
    "VOI placement: Looking at the MPRAGE images carefully, manually place the VOI on the most posterior part of the occipital lobe, covering the calcarine sulci that corresponded to early visual areas bilaterally (Shibata et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib30]) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). Carefully place the VOI to include the least amount of white matter, as lipids in the white matter may alter the shape of the spectra.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1200-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. VOI placement of a representative subject\nEach image shows sagittal (A), coronal (B) and transverse (C) view.\nShimming: use a vendor-provided automated tool (defined by the full width at half maximum of the water peak). See Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nMRS\nConduct a quick MEGA-PRESS sequence test (TR = 1.25 s, TE = 68 ms, 32 spectral averages, for edit-on and edit-off) to check whether the spectrum is acceptable, using the LCmodel (Provencher, 1993[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25], 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]).\nAcquire an unsuppressed water spectrum (TR = 1.25 s, TE = 68 ms, 16 spectral averages) as a standard water concentration reference for single-voxel proton MRS (Klose, 1990[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]; Oeltzschner et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]; Gasparovic et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nUp until this point, the procedure takes approximately 20–30 min. Since we had a 2 h-MRI slot, we would have remained 90–100 min for a sleep session.\nWhen ready to start the sleep session, tell the subjects “Have a good nap!”, which is meant to be the start of the sleep session.\nThen, turn off the lights and started MRS scans. For the sleep session, run the 5-s dummy scans for the steady state of longitudinal magnetization and 10-min water-suppressed MEGA-PRESS sequence (TR = 1.25 s, TE = 68 ms, 240 spectral averages for each edit-on and edit-off, and VOI = 2.2 × 2.2 × 2.2 cm3) repeatedly until the sleep session is over (approximately 9–10 repetitions).",
    "Stop the MRS scan when 9 or 10 times of MRS are conducted just before the 2 h MRI slot is over.\nNote: The MEGA-PRESS sequence (Mescher et al., 1998[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]; Edden and Barker, 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Hu et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]) was employed for J-difference editing of the 3.0 ppm GABA resonance. We used this sequence because MEGA-PRESS allowed us to measure concentrations of both GABA and Glx simultaneously from the VOI. Thus, the concentrations of GABA and Glx were acquired from the same scan during the same sleep stages, according to the procedure used in previous studies (Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]; Stagg et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib33], 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib32], 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib31]; Robertson et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28]; Henry et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). In contrast, in a previous study (Shibata et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib30]), a PRESS sequence was used for measurement of glutamate concentration measurements, and a MEGA-PRESS sequence was used for GABA measurements.\nNote: In the study (Tamaki et al., 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib37]), we used the Glx signal, which is a combined signal from glutamate with glutamine, as an excitatory neurotransmitter. This is because clear dissociation between the glutamate and glutamine may be difficult with a 3T machine. It is estimated that the contribution of glutamine to Glx is less than 15% (Floyer-Lea et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]), so that the Glx mostly represents glutamate.\nNote: In the MEGA-PRESS sequence, we used a shorter TR and a larger VOI size than a previous study (Shibata et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib30]) to increase the signal-to-noise ratios.",
    "Optional: In our study, because we wanted to test the role of REM sleep in visual perceptual learning, we had an NREM sleep-only condition without REM sleep, in which subjects were woken up before REM sleep started when the PSG display suggested that NREM sleep was ending and stopped the sleep session. The amount of artifacts that contaminated onto the online PSG data with MRS was smaller than the functional MRI scanner artifacts. Thus, while the online PSG display was noisier than the normal PSG data taken at a normal earthly magnetic field, some of PSGs were still able to be readable, especially between TRs (1.25 s) of the MEGA-PRESS sequence. Based on the online PSG, we terminated the sleep session when sleep stage N1 or N2 reappeared following stage N3 after NREM sleep lasted more than 40 min and when PSG showed desynchronized EEG activity and decreased EMG activity, a sign that indicates the end of NREM sleep and the start of REM sleep.\nPart 4: Postprocessing. First PSG segmentation by 10-min MRS scans\nTiming: 120 min\nSegmenting PSG by the start of MRS recording",
    "It is very important to locate the starting point of each MRS recording on the PSG data chronologically. The scanner artifacts caused by MRS is easily detected in the PSG data. This allows us to align the start of each MRS measurement on the PSG recording. Since the most of simultaneous MRS and PSG sessions takes approximately for 90 min, there will be 9 times of starting point of MRS on the PSG data. The duration of the sleep session was 90 min in our study (Tamaki et al., 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib37]), because the duration of one sleep cycle which includes NREM sleep and REM sleep is estimated as 90 min in human (Rechtschaffen and Kales, 1968[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]). In our study (Tamaki et al., 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib37]), the average (± SEM) time spent in NREM sleep was 43.7 ± 3.3 min, and that in REM sleep was 5.8 ± 1.3 min during the 90-min sleep session.\nOmit PSG data that correspond between MRS scans for later coregistration.\nBecause of these intervals between MRS scans, the artifact removal process described below works better after PSG was segmented.\nPSG recordings taken inside the MRI bore are contaminated by two types of artifacts: scanner and ballistocardiogram artifacts. Both types of artifacts were removed in the postprocessing phase in our study (Tamaki et al., 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib37]).\nRemove scanner artifacts using Brain Vision Analyzer 2 (Brain Products GmbH, Gilching, Germany) by subtracting an averaged artifact waveform, followed by adaptive noise cancellation to reduce any residual artifact (Allen et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). The steps taken in Brain Vision Analyzer 2 for scanner artifact removal with MRS are slightly different from those with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This is because trigger information that is synchronized with volume acquisition is available in fMRI, but not with MRS. Take the following three steps:",
    "Use a “detection method” in Brain Vision Analyzer 2 to detect the scanner artifacts in the PSG recording. Because scanner artifacts in PSG recording appear with a much larger amplitude than artifacts induced by spontaneous oscillatory activity, the detection method utilizes the peaks of scanner artifacts.\nAfter selecting all the channels for artifact removal, select “continuous” for the scan type in Brain Vision Analyzer 2, since the MRS scans are carried out continuously.\nAfter the baseline correction, reduce the sampling rate to 250 Hz for the next step for a ballistocardiogram artifact removal. While EEG data are usually recorded with high sampling frequency (e.g., 5000 Hz), it would take extremely long time for a ballistocardiogram artifact removal with such a large data size. The reduced sampling size (250 Hz) is sufficient for the ballistocardigram artifact removal. Apply a low-pass filter at 100 Hz.\nRemove ballistocardiogram artifacts by detecting heart-beat events and subtracting an artifact template from the PSG data processed by EEGLAB (The University of Oxford) with the FMRIB plug-in. Brain Vision Analyzer 2 could also be used.\nSubsequently, rereference EEG data to TP9 and TP10 using EEGLAB for sleep stage scoring.\nSleep stage scoring for each PSG segment according to these studies (Rechtschaffen and Kales, 1968[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]; Iber et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]).\nEach PSG segment should be approximately 10-min long. One sleep stage is assigned for a 30-s epoch. Assign one of sleep stages (wakefulness, N1, N2, N3, REM sleep, and artifacts, which is unsuccessful denoising that precludeded sleep scoring).\nNote: The timing for the lights off should be identified in the PSG data.\nNote: We also conducted frequency analysis on the EEG data in a previous study (Tamaki et al., 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib37]). Please see the previous study for details about the frequency analysis.",
    "Note: The FMRIB plug-in processes data based on triggers synchronized with volume acquisition. However, because there was no trigger information available with MRS, the FMRIB plug-in was not used for the removal of scanner artifacts in our analysis.\nPart 5: Postprocessing. How to assign sleep stages to MRS data, including decision-making guidance for further segmentation in a 10-min segment\nTiming: 15 min\nAfter PSG segmentation, assign one of the sleep stages to the MRS data. Here, we explain the procedure when there are 9 MRS recordings during the sleep session.\nIdentify the 10-min segment of PSG that correspond to one MRS scan. There will be 9 segments that are of 10 min each.\nAs mentioned above, on PSG data, identify the start of each MRS scan, which lasts approximately 10 min. If there are 9 times of MRS scans, there should be 8 time-intervals (up to 10 s) between each MRS scan on the PSG data, as each MRS is manually started. Do not use these PSG data corresponding to the intervals of MRS. One MRS scan and one PSG segment are the same length (approximately 10 min).\nCombine sleep stages N1, N2 and N3 together and label them as “NREM sleep” in each PSG segment, after sleep stage scoring (as mentioned above).\nIn total, we classify sleep stages into 4 categories: NREM sleep, REM sleep, wakefulness and artifacts (which is not wakefulness, NREM sleep or REM sleep).\nFollow the guidelines below for the decision whether to consider a whole 10-min segment as one segment or to further split the segment into multiple segments.\nDo not further split the segment in the following two cases.\nOne 10-min MRS scan corresponds to a single sleep stage (wakefulness, NREM sleep, or REM sleep)",
    "More than 80% of the 10-min MRS scan is dominated by one of the sleep stages.\nCoregister one sleep stage label to a 10-min MRS segment .\nPerform further segmentation of 10-min MRS data when one 10-min MRS scan corresponds to multiple sleep stage labels.\nWhen none of the wakefulness, NREM sleep, or REM sleep states in a 10-min PSG segment exceeds 80% of the segment, split one 10-min MRS scan into five 2-min MRS segments using the raw data (twix files).\nSplit the 10-min PSG segment that is originally coupled with the 10-min MRS segment into five 2-min PSG segments. Thus, each 2-min MRS segment is coupled with its corresponding 2-min PSG segment.\nFor each 2-min MRS segment, register the mode (the most frequent) sleep stage. Note that there should be 4 (each 30-s) sleep stages in the 2-min PSG segment.\nIf the same number of different sleep stages is observed in a 2-min PSG segment, follow the identification hierarchy: wakefulness > NREM sleep > REM sleep. For instance, if there were 2 epochs of wakefulness and 2 epochs of REM sleep, label the segment wakefulness.\nThis hierarchy is implemented for the following two purposes. The first purpose is to remove any MRS segments containing a wakefulness stage from MRS segments identified during sleep stages. This reduces possible contamination of the MRS data for a sleep state with that for a wakefulness state. The second purpose is to obtain MRS data for REM sleep with a reduced possibility of contamination by an NREM sleep state.\nRemove an MRS segment from further analyses if either the number of PSG segments contains artifacts or the number of epochs shows arousal.\nThis way you classify each MRS segment (2-min or 10-min) as either wakefulness, NREM sleep or REM sleep.",
    "Note: Splitting data into five 2-min segmentations may occur in the first part of sleep due to the shift from wakefulness to sleep onset then in the later phase of sleep due to the shift from NREM sleep to REM sleep.\nPart 6: Postprocessing. Calculation of the mean E/I balance for each of NREM sleep and REM sleep\nTiming: 15 min\nStart this part after completion of coregistration between MRS and PSG segmentation. Here, we explain how to obtain the E/I balance for NREM sleep and REM sleep when there are 9 MRS scans, and the two out of nine 10-min MRS-PSG segments are split into five 2-min segments during the sleep session. Thus, the example contains seven 10-min and ten 2-min MRS-PSG segments, for a total of 17 MRS-PSG segments. Assume that there are 5 MRS-PSG segments labeled as wakefulness, 8 as NREM sleep and 4 as REM sleep.\nFor each MRS-PSG segment (2 min or 10 min), using the LCmodel, obtain the concentrations of NAA, Glx, and GABA. Use NAA as a reference metabolite.\nDivide the amounts of Glx and GABA by the amount of NAA. The results refer to as the concentrations of Glx and GABA, respectively. Although NAA would be canceled out when measuring the E/I balance (see b next), this step is necessary to measure the concentrations of Glx and GABA.\nCalculate the E/I balance by dividing the concentration of Glx by GABA for each of 17 MRS-PSG segments.\nCalculate the baseline E/I balance by averaging the E/I balance for MRS-PSG segments labeled as wakefulness (in this example, using 5 MRS-PSG segments).\nIn each of the remaining 12 MRS-PSG segments, calculate the E/I balance by normalizing to the baseline.\n(E/Isegment − E/Ibaseline)/(E/Ibaseline)",
    "Obtain the mean E/I balance for NREM sleep by averaging the normalized E/I balance across 8 MRS-PSG segments labeled NREM sleep.\nObtain the mean E/I balance for REM sleep by averaging the normalized E/I balance across 4 MRS-PSG segments labeled REM sleep.\nNote: While creatine has sometimes been used as a reference metabolite in other MRS studies, we used NAA as the reference metabolite. NAA was chosen because the creatine singlet cancels out in the final spectra in the MEGA-PRESS sequence. At any rate, in the calculation of E/I balances, the contribution of the reference metabolite is canceled out.\nNote: An alternative way is to average the MRS data from all the segments for each of sleep stages first and then using the LCmodel to obtain the concentrations of Glx and GABA.\nNote: In the calculation of the E/I balance, the weighted average based on the duration is another option."
