    "Notes: This protocol was adapted from the protocol of PrimeFlow RNA Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).Up to 4 different target probes may be used simultaneously. Thermo Fisher Scientific provides 4 probe types: Type 1: Alexa Fluor 647 Type 4: Alexa Fluor 488 Type 6: Alexa Fluor 750 Type 7: Alexa Fluor 568 In our protocol, we used Type 1 IRF4 and Type 4 MAFB.We recommend using the 96-well v-bottom plates supplied by Thermo Fisher Scientific for an easier and faster procedure. Discard supernatant by inverting the plate. However, other plates or tubes can also be used. (see ‘Notes’ for details)For this protocol, we used human CD14+ monocytes purified from fresh blood that were kept on ice (baseline) or cultured in RPMI with 100 ng/ml of M-CSF or 100ng/ml M-CSF, 5 ng/ml of IL-4, 5ng/ml of TNFa and 62 nM of FICZ for 3 or 12 h (Goudot et al., 2017).Day 1: from cell harvest to cell fixationPre-warm PrimeFlow RNA Wash Buffer to room temperature. Pre-warm the incubator to 40 °C. You need to turn on the incubator 24 h prior to using it to ensure temperature stability.Distribute 1.5 x 106 cells per well.Stain cells with 50 μl of eFluorTM 506 fixable viability dye (1/250 dilution in flow cytometry buffer) for 20 min. Centrifuge at 450 x g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.Add 200 μl of flow cytometry buffer to each sample and resuspend cells by pipetting.Centrifuge at 450 x g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.Prepare Fixation Buffer 1 by mixing equal parts of PrimeFlow RNA Buffer 1A and PrimeFlow RNA Buffer 1B. Distribute 200 μl of Fixation Buffer 1 to each sample and mix by pipetting. Incubate for 30 min at 2-8 °C.",
    "Centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 4 min at 4 °C and discard supernatant.Prepare 1x PrimeFlow RNA Permeabilization Buffer. Dilute 10x PrimeFlow RNA Buffer to 1x with RNase-free water and add RNase inhibitors at 1/100 dilution. Distribute 200 μl of Permeabilization Buffer 1 to each sample and mix by pipetting. No incubation is required. Centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 4 min at 4 °C. Discard supernatant.Repeat Step A11.Prepare 1x Fixation Buffer 2. Dilute 8x PrimeFlow RNA Fixation Buffer 2 in PrimeFlow RNA Wash Buffer. Mix by inverting.Distribute 200 μl of Fixation Buffer 2 to each sample and mix by pipetting. Incubate for 60 min in the dark at room temperature. Centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 4 min at room temperature and discard supernatant.Add 200 μl of PrimeFlow RNA Wash buffer to each sample and resuspend cells by pipetting. Centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 4 min at 4 °C and discard supernatant.Repeat Step A16. Store cells in 100 μl of PrimeFlow RNA Wash Buffer with RNase inhibitors diluted 1/100 overnight in the dark at 4 °C.Day 2: Target probe hybridizationNote: For the following steps, to ensure reproducibility across wells, it is important that the residual volume after each wash remains lower than 10 μl. The volume for the hybridization step (Procedure B) must be 200 μl. Thaw 20x target Probe sets at room temperature. Pre-warm Prime Flow RNA Target probe diluent to 40 °C and PrimeFlow RNA Wash Buffer at room temperature. You will need 100 μl of Prime Flow RNA Target probe diluent maximum per sample.Dilute target probes 1/20 in PrimeFlow Target Probe diluent. Mix by inverting.Distribute 100 μl of diluted target probes to each sample (100 μl of cells) and mix by pipetting. Incubate plate with the lid on for 2.",
    "5 h at 40 °C in the dark. Centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 4 min at room temperature. Discard supernatant.Add 200 μl of PrimeFlow RNA Wash buffer to each sample and resuspend cells by pipetting. Centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 4 min at 4 °C and discard supernatant.Repeat Step B6.Add 100 μl of PrimeFlow RNA Wash Buffer to each sample and resuspend cells by pipetting.Day 2: Signal amplificationNote: For the following steps, to ensure reproducibility across wells, it is important that the residual volume after each wash remains lower than 10 μl. The volume for all the hybridization steps must be 200 μl.Pre-warm PrimeFlow RNA pre-Amp mix, PrimeFlow RNA Amp Mix and PrimeFlow Label probe RNA Diluent to 40 °C.Distribute 100 μl of PrimeFlow RNA pre-amp mix to each sample and mix by pipetting.

Centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 4 min at 4 °C and discard supernatant.Repeat Step C4.Distribute 100 μl of PrimeFlow RNA Wash Buffer to each sample. Then distribute 100 μl of PrimeFlow RNA Amp Mix to each sample and mix by pipetting. Incubate for 1.5 h at 40 °C in the dark.Thaw PrimeFlow RNA Label Probes (100x) in the dark.Centrifuge the plate at 1,000 x g for 4 min at room temperature. Discard supernatant.

Discard supernatant and resuspend cells in 100 μl of flow cytometry Buffer.Day 2: Data acquisitionPrepare single-color compensation tubes for AF488 and AF647 using the PrimeFlow® Compensation kit. You should also have single color controls for your fixable dye and for each fluorescent antibody you used.Label two tubes ‘AF488’ and ‘AF647’.Mix UltraComp eBeads microspheres by vortexing.Add one drop of UltraComp eBeads to each tube. Add 5 μl of AF488 compensation control and AF647 compensation control to the appropriate tube.

Each single color tube will have both a negative and a positive bead population.Acquire each single color compensation tube. A minimum of 2,000 total events is recommended to enable proper calculation of compensations. Acquire each sample tube. A minimum of 100,000 total events is recommended."
