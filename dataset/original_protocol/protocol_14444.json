    "The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Massachusetts Eye and Ear. Experiments were carried out according to the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association.\n1. Preparing the Dissection\nPreparing the surgical table\nUse 70% ethanol to disinfect the surgical table.\nPlace two nonsterile prep pads next to the microscope.\nPrepare the instrument tray, including heat-sterilized operating scissors, a scalpel handle, a micro knife, and forceps (two each of #4 & #55). Place the instrument tray and a 50 mm, clear-walled, glass-bottomed petri dish onto one non-sterile pad.\nObtain a sterile #15 scalpel blade; a sealable plastic bag or container (to dispose of the carcasses in line with institutional guidelines); ice in a bucket; and cold, sterile Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). Place these items onto the other nonsterile pad.\nTransfer the HBSS into a 50 mL plastic laboratory tube and put it on ice.\nPreparing the culture\nPrepare all materials in a laminar flow hood. For every four specimens, put four autoclaved 10 mm round glass cover slips in the four inlays of the 35 mm 4-well petri dish.\nFor every 4 specimens, mix a total volume of 300 µL consisting of the following in a microcentrifuge tube: 10 µL of tissue adhesive, 285 µL of NaHCO3, and 5 µL of NaOH.\nPut 45 µL of the resulting solution on every cover slip and leave it there for at least 20 min at RT; this solution can be left on the coverslip for several hours but cannot be left O/N.\nPlace one or two 35 mm 4-well petri dish(es) inside a 10 cm Petri dish in order to create two barriers against contamination.",
    "Prepare culture medium containing 98% Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM), 1% N-2, and 1% ampicillin (65 µL per well in a (micro)centrifuge tube). Warm the solution to 25 °C prior to use.\n2. Murine Cochlear Explant Dissection\nDecapitation of the neonatal mouse\nObtain a 60 mm plastic petri dish and spray 70% ethanol in its lid so that the surface is wet.\nPour cold HBSS from the plastic laboratory tube into the bottom part of the 60 mm plastic and the 50 mm clear-walled, glass-bottomed petri dish. Store the plastic laboratory tube and both petri dishes on ice to keep the tissue cold whenever it is not being dissected.\nPlace a P3 - P5-aged neonatal mouse on ice in a cutoff finger of a latex glove and wait until the hypothermia induces loss of consciousness (approximately 1-3 min).\nDecapitate the mouse quickly with operating scissors and dispose of the body in the sealable plastic bag. Put the severed neonate head in the 70% ethanol in the lid of the 60 mm plastic petri dish.\nMacroscopic dissection of the temporal bone\nRemove the skin of the skull by making a superficial cut from the anterior to the posterior end (directly on top of the sagittal suture) using the scalpel blade.\nCut both external auditory canals with the scalpel blade and fold the skin anteriorly to expose the whole cranium.\n\t\t​NOTE: Although no dissection microscope is usually needed for this step, it can be used for improved visualization.\nOpen the cranium along the sagittal suture using the #15 scalpel blade. Make sure to cut the cranium by gently moving the blade up and down from anterior to posterior to avoid compression of the cochleae.\n\t\t​NOTE: The cranium should not be ossified at this age and should cut easily.",
    "Remove and discard the snout by making a vertical cut directly posterior to the orbits using the #15 scalpel blade.\n\t\t​NOTE: The posterior part of the skull should still contain the brain and cochleae.\nDispose of the forebrain, cerebellum, and brainstem through blunt dissection with #4 forceps.\nMicroscopic extraction of the cochleae\nAdjust the microscope (6.5X magnification) and light source by placing forceps under the scope and optimizing the illumination and focus.\nPlace the two halves of the cranium into the 60 mm plastic petri dish filled with cold HBSS.\nCompletely expose the cochlea/e, identifiable as being adjacent to the surrounding stapedial artery (a tortuous artery within the temporal bone), and bluntly separate the organ from the temporal bone using #4 forceps.\nTransfer the cochlea into the 50 mm, clear-walled, glass-bottomed petri dish and position the dish under the microscope.\nPlace the 60 mm plastic petri dish with the other half of the cranium on ice.\nRemove the cochlea from the vestibular system and carefully dissect the cochlear otic capsule (typically cartilaginous at this age) with #4 forceps. Use #55 forceps for all further steps.\nFinal steps of tissue processing\nContinue with the processing of the inner ear tissue by carefully separating the spiral ligament adherent to the organ of Corti from the rest of the cochlea and the modiolus using the micro knife or two forceps.\n\t\t\nCut into the darker, translucent area at the crevice between the spiral ligament and the hair cell region and proceed to the subsequent removal of the spiral ligament by grasping it at the most basal aspect and gently unwinding it while moving apically.",
    "Position the specimen to obtain a longitudinal, sagittal view of the cochlea and cut the cochlea into two to three sections using the micro knife, classifying these sections as the apical, (middle,) and basal turns. Remove the tissue superior and inferior to the actual layer of hair cells and neurites in order to achieve a cochlear explant piece that can lay horizontally on the petri dish.\n\t\t​NOTE: An appropriate size for stable adhesion to the culture dish is approximately half of one cochlear turn.\nRemove the tectorial membrane, a very thin translucent layer immediately superior to the organ of Corti, by gently peeling it away with forceps.\nRemove Reissner's membrane, immediately superior to the SGNs, by touching it with forceps on both sides and peeling it away.\n\t\tNOTE: Remove any laterally-located damaged hair cell areas by cutting them away with the micro knife.\n3. Transfer of Specimens to the Culture Plates\nRemove the 45 µL of tissue adhesive solution from the four cover slips. Wash each cover slip with 50 µL of sterile H2O. Aspirate the water.\nPick up the 1 mL pipette. Wet the pipette tip with approximately 120 µL of DMEM to prevent the specimen from adhering to the inside of the tip.\nTransfer the specimens individually using the 1 mL pipette. Pipette a maximum of 70 µL from the HBSS-filled, small, clear-walled, glass-bottomed petri dish and place the specimen along with the liquid on one of the 4 inlays (prepared with cover slips) in the 4-well petri dish.",
    "Check under the microscope (50X magnification) that the specimen is in the correct orientation. Ensure that the area of hair cells from which the tectorial membrane was removed faces upwards. Ensure that the basilar membrane, together with the trimmed, basal part of the modiolus, faces downwards and adheres to the coverslip.\nIf the specimen is oriented upside-down upon inspection, deposit the HBSS that remains in the pipette tip into the inlay and reposition the piece until it is correctly oriented.\n\t\tNOTE: This will prevent hair cells from floating in culture medium without structural support from the coverslip, which could lead to degeneration.\nAspirate excess HBSS using the 1 mL pipette. Wait for 15 s.\nPipette 60 µL of the prepared warm culture medium (98% DMEM, 1% N-2, and 1% ampicillin) directly onto the specimen. Take care not to touch the specimen with the pipette. Replace the inner and outer petri dish covers and incubate O/N at 37 °C.\nPut all of the stock solutions back in their proper places, dispose of carcasses and residual waste, decontaminate the surgical table according to institutional guidelines (e.g., using ethanol or hypochlorite), clean and autoclave the instruments, and discard the sharps in the appropriate container.\n4. Adding Final Culture Media and Substances of Interest\nNOTE: Cochlear explants will be ready for use 10-16 h later.\nPrepare a mixture of 97% DMEM, 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% N-2, and 1% ampicillin (65 µL per well in a microcentrifuge tube; warm the solution to 25 °C prior to use).",
    "Add other substances of interest to the solutions for the respective treatment groups. If fluorescent substances are added (e.g., green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing viruses; in a recent publication, a concentration of 1010 GC of Adeno-Associated Viruses (AAVs) was used for 48 h in 50 µL)18, protect from light.\nTransfer the cochlear explant-containing petri dishes from the incubator and place them under the laminar flow hood.\nAspirate the old culture medium (w/o FBS) with the pipette from the inlays.\nAdd 60 µL per well of the prepared warm culture (treatment) medium (97% DMEM, 1% FBS, 1% N-2, 1% ampicillin, and the substances of interest).\nPlace the petri dish back into the incubator (37 °C).\nView regularly under the microscope to identify signs of contamination, cellular migration, or detachment of the cochlear explant and perform staining after a maximum of 7 days.\n5. Immunofluorescence - Day 1\nPrepare blocking solution (94% Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS), 5% normal goat or horse serum (NGS/NHS, depending on the secondary antibodies), and 1% non-ionic surfactant (see the Table of Materials)) and stock antibody solution (98.6% PBS, 1% NHS, and 0.4% non-ionic surfactant with the respective antibodies).\n\tNOTE: Antibodies include rabbit anti-Myo7A at a concentration of 1:400+ (myosin 7A, for inner and outer hair cells) and mouse anti-TuJ1 1:200+ (β-tubulin, for SGNs) OR mouse(IgG1) anti-CtBP2 1:200+ (c-terminal binding protein, for presynapse), mouse(IgG2a) anti-PSD95 1:50+ (postsynaptic density, for postsynapse), and chicken anti-NF-H 1:1000+ (neurofilament, for SGNs and nerve fibers). \"+\" means \"or higher.\"\nAspirate the culture medium using a pipette. Take care not to touch the specimen.\nUnder the laminar flow hood, rinse the cochlear explants twice with sterile PBS, placing the specimens on a shaker for 5 min after each wash.",
    "Fix the tissue in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA - CAUTION) for 20 min on the shaker (under the hood). Aspirate the PFA.\nApply 60 µL of PBS to the cochlear explants and place the petri dish on a shaker for 5 min. Aspirate the PBS. Repeat 3x.\nPlace the cochlear explants in prepared blocking solution (94% PBS, 5% NHS, and 1% non-ionic surfactant) for 30 min on shaker.\nPlace the cochlear explants in a prepared stock antibody solution (98.6% PBS, 1% NHS, and 0.4% non-ionic surfactant) with the respective primary antibodies (vortex before use) O/N on a counter at RT.\n\tNOTE: Wrap the petri dishes with damp paper towels enclosed in plastic wrap (or aluminum foil if the added solution contains fluorescent materials such as GFP-expressing viruses) to keep the dishes humid and to prevent evaporation of the antibody solution O/N.\n6. Immunofluorescence - Day 2\nPrepare the 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) stain (300 nM) and use the stock antibody solution to obtain the correct secondary antibody mixtures, complementary to the primary antibodies in step 5.1. (e.g., goat anti-rabbit 488 1:200+ and goat anti-mouse 568 1:200+ OR goat anti-mouse (IgG1) 568 1:1000+, goat anti-mouse (IgG2a) 488 1:500+, and goat anti-chicken 647 1:200+ OR Phalloidin 568 1:200+ (for inner and outer hair cells)).\nAspirate the primary antibody solution.\nApply 60 µL of PBS to the cochlear explants and place the petri dish on a shaker for 5 min. Aspirate the PBS. Repeat 3x.\nPlace the cochlear explants in prepared stock antibody solution (98.6% PBS, 1% NHS, and 0.4% non-ionic surfactant) with the respective secondary antibodies (vortex before use) for 1.5 h on a counter and protect from light.\nAspirate the secondary antibody solution and rinse the cochlear explants with a DAPI stain (placing on a shaker for 1 min and then aspirate).",
    "Apply 60 µL of PBS to the cochlear explants and place the petri dish on a shaker for 5 min. Aspirate the PBS. Repeat 3x.\nUse forceps to remove coverslips with specimens from the 4-well plate, dip them into a recipient filled with distilled H2O, and dry the coverslips by vertically bringing them into contact with paper towels.\nPlace a drop of antifade mounting medium onto the microscope slide and invert the coverslips to immerse the downward-facing tissue in the medium.\nSeal the coverslip using clear nail polish circumferentially covering the edge (without crushing the specimen under the glass). Leave the slides lying flat in a covered area away from light for 15 - 20 min until dry and then place them in a box or examine under the confocal microscope.\n\tNOTE: Fluorescent staining is best preserved by storing the slides at 4 or -20 °C.\n7. Confocal Imaging\nObtain an overview and zoomed-in pictures for the organ of Corti region, including neurites and SGNs.\n\tNOTE: Standard settings for the imaging process: Format of 1,024 x 1,024 pixels, speed of 400 Hz, frame average of 3, 20% overall laser intensity, and usually 20X and 63X lens with oil immersion (potentially combined with 2X digital zoom). Channel settings for the DAPI, Myo7A, and TuJ1 staining protocol are outlined above: 405 5% DAPI, \"Smart Gain\" 766.8V, \"Smart Offset\" 0.0% - 488 15% fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), \"Smart Gain\" 622.2V, \"Smart Offset\" 0.0% - 561 13% tetramethylrhomadine isothiocyanate (TRITC), \"Smart Gain\" 562.4V, \"Smart Offset\" 0.0%.\nMerge the images in a z-stack using the software to obtain a z-axis projection.\nSubscription Required.
