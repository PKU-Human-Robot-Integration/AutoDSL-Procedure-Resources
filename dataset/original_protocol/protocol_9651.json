    "The C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Zhejiang University School of Medicine Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital. The New Zealand rabbits were purchased from Zhejiang University. The animals were maintained in natural light-dark cycle conditions and given food and drinking water freely. All experimental procedures were approved ethically by the institutional guidelines of the Zhejiang University Ethics Committee standard guidelines (ZJU20200156) and Zhejiang University School of Medicine Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital Animal Care and Use Committee, which conformed to the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (SRRSH202107106).\n1. Synthesis of NB-COOH\nPrepare 4-hydroxy-3-(methoxy-D3) benzaldehyde (8.90 g, 58.5 mM, 1.06 equivalents [eq.]), potassium carbonate (10.2 g, 73.8 mM, 1.34 eq.), and methyl 4-bromobutyrate (9.89 g, 55.0 mM, 1.0 eq.) based on the protocol proposed in the previous study10. Dissolve the compounds in 40 mL of N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and stir at ambient temperature for 16 h.\nAdd 200 mL of 0 °C water to the mixture and precipitate the mixture to obtain a crude product.\nRepeatedly dissolve the crude product in DMF and then precipitate for five cycles. Precipitate the crude product and dry it at 80 °C for 2 h to obtain the early product.\n2. Chemical modification and processing\nPerform the ipso substitution of methyl 4-(4-formyl-2-methoxyphenoxy methoxyphenyl) butanoic acid methyl ester as described below.\nAdd 9.4 g of methyl 4-(4-formyl-2-methoxyphenoxy) butanoate (37.3 mM, 1 eq.) slowly to a precooled (-2 °C) solution of 70% nitric acid (140 mL) and stir at -2 °C for 3 h.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the temperature of the nitration reaction, the ipso substitution of the formyl moiety will occur.\nFilter the mixture (~9.0 g) with 200 mL of 0 °C water, then purify it in DMF to precipitate a solid product.",
    "Hydrolyze the solid product in trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/H2O, 1:10 v/v (100 mL) at 90 °C and dry. Remove the solvent under 80 kPa to obtain the final intermediate product, a dry pale-yellow powder.\nDissolve the intermediate product (7.4 g, 23.8 mM, 1.0 eq.) in tetrahydrofuran (THF)/ethanol, 1:1 v/v (100 mL). Then add 1.43 g of NaBH4 (35.7 mM, 1.5 eq.) slowly at 0 °C. After 3 h, remove all solvents under a vacuum and suspend the residue in a 1:1 water and dichloromethane solution (50 mL each).\nPrepare dichloromethane to extract the product from the aqueous layer. Remove the organic layer and dry over magnesium sulfate.\nPurify the crude product by silica gel column chromatography using DCM/MeOH at a 10:1 ratio (1% TEA). Finally, obtain 5.31 g (18.6 mM, 78.3%) of relatively pure yellowish powder NB-COOH.\n3. Synthesis of gelatin-NB\nPrepare 5 g of gelatin for one batch of modification. Prepare a homogeneous gelatin solution by dissolving 5 g of gelatin in 100 mL of deionized water and store at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: Here, the original 33 x 10-5 moles ε-amino groups/g gelatin11 is defined.\nDefine the feed ratio (FR) as the molar ratio between NB groups and primary amino groups in gelatin. In this study, 53 mg of NB with 1 g of gelatin was defined as FRNB = 1.\nDissolve 1,060 mg of NB-COOH in 5 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to activate the carboxyl groups of NB-COOH. Since the NB-group is sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) light when in solution, always keep it away from light.\nAdd 746 mg of 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodimide hydrochloride (EDC) into the NB-COOH DMSO solution and stir for 5 min. After EDC has dissolved, add 448 mg of N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) and stir for 5 min.",
    "Use a dropping funnel to slowly drop the mixture at a rate of 0.5 mL/min into the dissolved gelatin solution with vigorous stirring to react at 45 °C for 4 h.\n4. Purification and storage of the product\nDialyze the gelatin-NB solution against excess deionized water for at least 3 days, then collect, freeze, and lyophilize it to obtain the gelatin-NB foams. Keep the foams in a desiccator in the dark for further use.\nDissolve the freeze-dried gelatin-NB foams in deionized water at 37 °C, immediately before use.\nSubscription Required.
