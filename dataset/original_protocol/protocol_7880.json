    "Microtubule binding assayPreparation of the soluble (cytoplasmic) extractThis step necessarily depends on the cells or tissues on which one is working. In theory, soft tissues (such as animal tissues) can be lysed directly in the lysis buffer using either plastic Eppendorf pestles or an Ultra-Turrax homogenizer in case of complex tissues. For plant cells, it is preferable to freeze the tissue of interest under liquid nitrogen and then grind it with pestle and mortar. After the tissue was completely powdered, the liquid nitrogen is allowed to evaporate. The tissue powder is moved to a suitable tube, like eppendorf tubes or 15-ml conical tubes (depending on the amount of starting material). The lysis buffer is added and the sample is incubated at 4 °C or on ice for 15 min with gentle agitation. At the end, the sample is centrifuged at high speed (> 100,000 x g) for pelleting cellular debris and for getting cytosolic proteins in the supernatant. Although the extract of soluble proteins can be frozen under liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C, we always prefer to work with fresh material because it is difficult to estimate the temporal stability of the extract. The composition of lysis buffer may be adjusted from species to species, please refer to the literature on the specific tissue in order to determine the best lysis buffer.Determine protein concentration of the cytoplasmic extract in order to mix known protein quantities. Several commercial kits are available for determination of protein concentration (such as the 2D Quant Kit or the Bradford Protein Assay kit). Always take an aliquot for electrophoresis.Preparation of microtubulesThaw one aliquot of lyophilized tubulin (animal or plant source, 1 mg), then add 200 μl of TDB so that the final concentration is 5 mg/ml.",
    "Add 25 μl of GB and incubate at 35 °C for 20 min.Mix 1.8 ml of TDB with 81 μl of 500 μM taxol (TDB-T). Incubate at 35 °C for 15-20 min in such a way that the temperature of the taxol solution is the same of tubulin.At the end of incubation, add 1.8 ml of TDB-T to 225 μl of the tubulin sample. Mix gently. Tubulin is now in a final volume of ≈ 2 ml at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml.Prepare additional TDB-T by mixing 1.8 ml of TDB with 81 μl of 500 μM taxol.Preparing the binding mix.Mix the cytosolic extract (in variable amounts, for example from 0 to 40 microliters, in order to work with a range of 10-100 micrograms of protein) with a constant volume of the microtubule sample (40 microliters). Use the remaining volume for the addition of other substances (i.e. inhibitors), and then adjust the volume to 100 microliters with TDB-T buffer. Volumes can be increased correspondingly to accommodate for different rotors and tubes.Incubate the samples at room temperature for 30 min.The test temperature can be adjusted if it is a variable examined in the experiment.Separation of cytoskeletal filamentsCentrifuge the samples at 100,000 x g for 40 min at 20 °C over 0.5 ml of sucrose cushion buffer.After centrifugation, the supernatant is located above the sucrose cushion and may therefore be removed with a pipette without touching the sucrose cushion. Process the supernatants for electrophoresis.Resuspend the pellets directly into a denaturing buffer suitable for electrophoretic analysis (e.g. Laemmli buffer) (max. 100 microliters).AnalysisTest individual fractions (supernatants and pellets) by electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and possibly by western blot, the latter being required to identify specifically and to quantify the protein of interest.",
    "Actin filament binding assayPreparation of cell lysateIt depends on the particular tissue or cells on which one is working. See the previous protocol for more details.Determine the protein concentration of samples using commercial kits (such as the 2D Quant Kit or the Bradford Protein Assay kit) and always collect one aliquot for electrophoresis.Preparation of actin filamentsThaw one aliquot of lyophilized actin (animal or plant sources, 1 mg).Dilute the actin to a concentration of 10 mg/ml by adding 100 μl of A-buffer. Remove solution from the tube (usually an Eppendorf tube) and place in 5-ml or 15-ml tubes.Dilute the actin at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml with A-buffer (100 μl of actin + 2.4 ml of A-buffer). Incubate on ice for 1 h (agitation is not required).Add the Polymerization Inducer 1x final: 2.25 ml + 0.25 ml of actin Polymerization Inducer 10x. Incubate at room temperature for 1 h.Preparing the binding mix.Mix the cytosolic extract (in variable amounts, for example from 0 to 40 microliters, in order to work with a range of 10-100 micrograms of protein) with a constant volume of the actin filament sample (50 microliters). Use the remaining volume for the addition of other substances (i.e. inhibitors), and then adjust the volume to 100 microliters with the A-buffer/Polymerization Inducer mix (which is the same buffer of the actin solution). Volumes can be increased correspondingly to accommodate for different rotors and tubes.Incubate samples at room temperature for 30-60 min.The test temperature can be adjusted if it is a variable examined in the experiment.Separation of cytoskeletal filamentsCentrifuge samples at 150,000 x g for 60-90 min at 20 °C over 0.5 ml of the cushion buffer for F-actin.Take the supernatants and process them for electrophoresis.Resuspend the pellets in 100 μl of a denaturing buffer suitable for electrophoretic analysis (e.g. Laemmli buffer).",
    "AnalysisTest individual fractions (supernatants and pellets) by electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and possibly by western blot, the latter being required to identify specifically and to quantify the protein of interest (Figure 1).In both cases, the relative quantification of bands after western blot analysis can be performed using image acquisition systems and specific software (free like ImageJ or paid such as the Bio-Rad Quantity One). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20131120/20131120195132_2138.jpgFigure 1. Example of binding analysis with actin filaments. Specifically, the protein myosin from rabbit skeletal muscle (arrow) was incubated with filamentous actin (arrowhead). S and P indicate the supernatants and pellets, respectively. Lane 1, molecular weight standard, the value of which is indicated by numbers on the left. Lane 2, myosin (commercially available). Lanes 3-4, supernatant and pellet obtained after incubation of myosin with actin filaments. Lanes 5-6, supernatant and pellet obtained after incubation of myosin with actin filaments in the presence of 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate (AMPPNP, a non-hydrolyzable analogue of ATP). Lanes 7-8, supernatant and pellet obtained after incubation of myosin with actin filaments in the presence of ATP. Note that myosin binds weakly in the presence of ATP but very strongly in the presence of AMPPNP."
