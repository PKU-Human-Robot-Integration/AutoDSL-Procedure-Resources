    "The experimental protocol was conducted in accordance with the requirements of the Use of Laboratory Animals and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Ningxia Medical University. Male Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs weighing 300-450 g were used for the present study. The effect of digoxin on contractility was observed in isolated right atria from the guinea pigs (Figure 2).\n1. Oxygenation preparation for the isolated right atria of guinea pigs\nPrepare the experimental instruments, including a biological signal acquisition and processing system, a JH-2 muscle force transducer, a Magnus bath, an L-shaped ventilation hook, thick scissors, a Petri dish, paraffin, etc. (see Table of Materials).\nPrepare 1,000 mL of Krebs-Henseleit solution (K-H solution) by adding 7.02 g of NaCl (120.0 mM), 2.10 g of NaHCO3 (25.0 mM), 0.30 g of KCl (4.0 mM), 0.07 g of MgSO4 (0.6 mM), 0.07 g of NaH2PO4 (0.6 mM), 0.28 g of CaCl2 (2.5 mM), and 1.98 g of glucose (11.0 mM) into 1,000 mL of double-distilled water, and rinse the Magnus bath two to three times (see Table 1 and Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Keep the temperature of the K-H solution at 37 °C ± 1 °C.\nPrepare 100 mL of low-calcium K-H solution by adding 0.70 g of NaCl (120.0 mM), 0.21 g of NaHCO3 (25.0 mM), 0.03 g of KCl (4.0 mM), 0.01 g of MgSO4 (0.6 mM), 0.01 g of NaH2PO4 (0.6 mM), 0.01 g of CaCl2 (0.8 mM), and 0.20 g of glucose (11.0 mM) into 100 mL of double-distilled water (see Table 1 and Table of Materials).\nPlace approximately 20 mL of the 37 °C K-H solution in the operating basin (see Table of Materials).",
    "Spread 5 mm of thick paraffin over the bottom of the Petri dish, and then fill the Petri dish with the 37 °C K-H solution (see Table of Materials).\nInstall the L-shaped ventilation hook on the latex tube end of the bladder, put it in the Petri dish, and adjust to 1-2 bubbles/s (see Table of Materials).\n\t​NOTE: Slowly adjust the bubbles; if the action is too quick, the oxygen may soon run out.\n2. Preparation of isolated right atria from guinea pigs\nWeigh guinea pigs on a scale (see Table of Materials).\nInduce anesthesia using an induction box with 5% isoflurane in 100% oxygen, and then switch to a nose cone with 1.5%-3% isoflurane for maintenance (see Table of Materials).\nCut the carotid artery with rough scissors, and induce exsanguination before placing it on a plate. Then, using scissors, open the thorax (starting with the xiphoid process and completely separating the sides to expose the heart), and peel off the pericardium.\n\t\nHold the heart up with the left hand, use the right hand to cut the heart from the root of the aorta, and quickly place it in the operating basin with the K-H solution. Finally, gently press the ventricle with the hand two to three times, squeeze out the ventricular blood, and place the heart in the Petri dish.\n\t\tNOTE: The action should be brisk and completed in 2-5 min, and the temperature must be controlled at 35 °C. The temperature of the K-H solution must be controlled at 37 °C.\nFix the tip of the heart to the paraffin-coated Petri dish with a needle while providing oxygen (60 bubbles/min).\nIdentify the right atrium.",
    "NOTE: In guinea pigs, the atria are separated on their ventral surface by the pulmonary artery and dorsally by the aorta. Both the left and right atria are attached to the ventricles like an \"inverted triangle\", and the right atrium is slightly smaller than the left atrium and has uneven edges. The myocardium of the right ventricle is thin, and the upper end of the collapse is the right atrium; the left ventricle is more puffed, and the distribution of coronary vessels is rich18 (Figure 3).\nGently lift the edge of the right atrium with ophthalmic forceps, and cut along the atrioventricular junction (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Avoid damaging the sinoatrial node, and try to cut more close to the ventricle while cutting along the atrioventricular junction. Automatic rhythmic contraction of the right atrium can be observed in this step.\nUse 4-0 surgical sutures (see Table of Materials) to ligate the top and bottom of the right atrium, respectively (both ends of the \"diagonal line\"), with one end looped and the other end left with a long thread end that is also looped.\n\t​NOTE: Try to ligate as few tissues as possible when ligating both ends of the \"diagonal line\" of the atria.\n3. Measurement and recording of the systolic function of isolated right atria from guinea pigs\nTurn on the computer, and enter the biological signal acquisition and processing system (see Table of Materials). Adjust the gain (50 mV), time constant (DC), filter (20 Hz), and scanning speed (1.00 s/div) after determining the connection channel (first channel, tension).\nHang one end of the specimen on the L-shaped ventilation hook with the Petri dish and oxygen beside the Magnus bath. Hang the other end of the specimen on the JH-2 muscle force transducer (see Table of Materials).",
    "Observe the atrial systolic curve, adjust the preload to 0.5-1.0 g, and wait for it to stabilize (about 30 min).\n\tNOTE: Change the K-H solution every 20 min. When normal, take the observed curve as the standard, and mark \"normal\". If the screen is scanned a little fast, this must be slowed down.\nAdminister 0.2 mL of low-calcium K-H solution, and observe for 5 min until the curve no longer declines.\nAdminister 0.2 mL of 5% digoxin (see Table of Materials), observe for 5 min, wash three times, and then return to normal.\n\tNOTE: Mark the administration. When the effect is obvious, scan the screen faster. When the curve no longer rises, that is, when the contraction amplitude no longer increases, wash three times quickly; otherwise, arrhythmia will occur, which will affect the results of the subsequent drug experiments.\nCollect the data, and save it to a floppy disk.\nSubscription Required.
