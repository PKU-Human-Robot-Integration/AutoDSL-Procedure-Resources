    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nEmbryo collection and brain isolation\nTiming: 30 min–2 h\nIsolation and fixation of embryonic (E12-E19)/postnatal (P0-P10) ACTB-Flpe:Pitx3-ITC brains. For adult brain, we recommend use of the iDISCO protocol with perfusion (Renier et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; https://idisco.info/idisco-protocol/[href=https://idisco.info/idisco-protocol/]) instead of the 3DISCO protocol.\nBrains are isolated in 1× PBS using a dissection microscope.\nAfter brain isolation, the meninges must be removed to allow better antibody penetration.\nBrains or whole embryos are fixed in 4% PFA in PBS (pH 7.4) without rotation at 4°C overnight (approx. 16 h).\nThe next day, PFA is removed and 1× PBS is added.\nCritical: Do not fix brain tissue longer than recommended. Immunostaining can otherwise be compromised due to excessive cross-linking of proteins.\nNote: For the analysis of embryos up to E15.5, whole embryos can be processed using this protocol depending on the quality of the primary antibody used. The anti-GFP antibody used here (Invitrogen) does not work effectively in whole embryos or in isolated brains with meninges. Therefore, when GFP immunostaining is required isolated brains without meninges are used for experiments, even for embryonic tissues (E13.5). For the analysis of E16.5 and older samples, brains are isolated from the embryo or pup.\nPause point: Brains can be stored at 4°C in 1× PBS for one week. For longer storage, add 0.01 % Thimerosal to the PBS.\nBleaching (for whole embryos)\nTiming: 2 days\nBleaching facilitates background reduction. This is accomplished by controlling autofluorescence derived from biomolecules such as heme, nicotinamides (NADP), and retinols (Croce and Bottiroli, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nNote: This step applies only to whole embryos (embryonic stages <E16.5). When isolated brains are used, skip this step and proceed to the immunostaining step.\nDehydration",
    "Leave the whole embryo in 1× PBS for 1.5 h (or longer) at room temperature (RT, 15°C–25°C) on a rotator.\nRemove PBS and add 50% methanol (diluted in PBS). Leave the sample for 1.5 h (or longer) at RT on a rotator.\nRemove 50% methanol and add 80% methanol (diluted in PBS). Leave the sample for 1.5 h (or longer) at RT on a rotator.\nRemove 80% methanol and add 100% methanol. Leave the sample for 1.5 h (or longer) at RT on a rotator.\nBleaching\nMove the embryo into the bleaching solution. Bleaching solution (100 mL) is prepared as 90 mL absolute methanol + 10 mL of 30% H2O2 stock (Final concentration of H2O2 in solution is 3%) and leave the sample overnight (approx. 16 h) at 4°C.\nCritical: (step 6) Do not rotate or shake the sample as this can lead to formation of bubbles which is not desirable at this step.\nRehydration\nMove the embryo to 100% methanol and incubate at RT on a rotator for at least 1 h.\nSubstitute the solution with new 100% methanol solution and leave it at RT on a rotator for at least 1 h.\nSubstitute the solution with 80% methanol (in PBS) and leave the sample at RT on a rotator for at least 1 h.\nSubstitute the solution with 50% methanol (in PBS) and leave the sample at RT on a rotator for at least 1 h.\nRemove the methanol and add 1× PBS. Leave the sample at RT on a rotator for at least 1 h.\nCritical: Methanol is toxic for the CNS and liver. It is volatile and inflammable. It must be used with caution in a fume hood.",
    "Pause point: Brains can be stored at 4°C in 1× PBS for one week. For longer storage, add 0.01 % Thimerosal to the PBS.\nWhole mount immunostaining\nTiming: variable – from 6 to 15 days\nBrains are immunostained to detect tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and Citrine which in ACTB-Flpe:Pitx3-ITC label the entire DA system and a subtype of SN DA neurons, respectively.\nBlocking\nThe sample is incubated in the blocking solution PBSGT at RT on a horizontal shaker (70 rpm in specified shaker). For incubation timing, follow the instructions in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_871_2.csv\nPause point: Longer incubation times at this step do not affect staining outcome (We recommend a maximum of 2 days).\nPrimary antibody incubation\nThe blocking solution is discarded and the primary antibody solution is added [primary antibodies: sheep anti-TH (1:500) and rabbit anti-GFP (1:1000) are diluted in PBSGT + 0.1% saponin]. The sample is incubated on a horizontal shaker at 37°C (70 rpm in specified shaker) as specified in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\nNote: Saponin removes membrane cholesterol, leaving pores in the membrane that aid tissue penetration. Saponin also facilitates the entry of antibodies into cells by forming saponin/cholesterol micelles (Seeman et al., 1973[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Lucy and Glauert, 1964[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nWashes\nThe sample is transferred to a 15 mL Falcon tube with 15 mL PBSGT. The tube must be rotated at RT for 1 h. 6 consecutive washes (of at least 1 h each) are required.\nPause point: The sample can be stored in PBS at 4°C. (We recommend a maximum of 2 days).\nSecondary antibody incubation\nThe selection of secondary antibodies is crucial. See Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] for suggestions.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_871_3.csv\naThe power of the individual lasers may be different in other setups.",
    "The sample is incubated in secondary antibody solution [donkey anti-sheep 568 (1:750) and donkey anti-rabbit 647 (1:750) are diluted in PBSGT + 0.1% saponin; the solution is filtered with a 0.20 μm filter before use]. The sample is incubated on a horizontal shaker at 37°C according to Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. Protect from light.\nNote: incubations are normally performed at 37°C to promote antibody penetration. In case the antibody is not compatible with incubation at 37°C, lower temperatures can be considered.\nNote: The Ultramicroscope set-up comes with two options: a laser beam combiner in which multiple laser lines are arranged in one set-up or a white light laser covering a range of wavelengths (460–800 nm). Depending on the Ultramicroscope set-up used, the 730 nm laser can be positioned in a separate beam combiner which might cause minor alignment variations in the light sheet angles. In such cases, pixel-based co-localization analysis should not be performed.\nWashes\nThe sample is transferred to a 15 mL dark Falcon tube with 15 mL PBSGT. The tube must be rotated at RT for 1 h. 6 consecutive washes (of at least 1 h each) are required.\nPause point: The sample can be stored in PBS at 4°C. (We recommend a maximum of 2 days).\nNote: For primary and secondary antibody incubation, 2 ml Eppendorf tubes with 2 ml antibody solutions are used. Secondary antibody incubation is performed in the dark.\nNote: Using this protocol it is also possible to use conjugated primary antibodies or nanobodies. In this case steps 11 and 12 can be skipped.\nTissue clearing\nTiming: 2 days\nTissue clearing renders brain tissue transparent thereby facilitating imaging of and through whole tissue.",
    "Critical: Several chemicals used in the tissue clearing step are hazardous. Appropriate precautions should be applied in handling and disposing of these chemicals (summarized in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). All clearing steps must be performed in the fume hood and while using protection.\nCritical: All incubations are performed at RT in Falcon tubes wrapped with aluminum foil / dark falcons to protect the sample from light. The sample is placed on a rotator (Stuart rotator SB3, rotor diameter 27 cm, 14 rpm).\nNote: In the incubation steps, 100% THF solution is refreshed once. The solution for the first incubation cycle can be reused for up to two weeks, while that of the second incubation cycle is always used fresh.\nNote: Before every step, remove excess fluid with a tissue. Dispose tissue in hazardous waste. Fill up tubes for dehydration and clearing as much as possible without airgap to prevent oxidation of solvents.\nDehydration\nThe sample is sequentially incubated in 50%, 80%, 100% and 100% solutions of tetrahydrofuran (THF) diluted in Milli-Q® ultrapure water at RT (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]). Leave the sample in 50% THF overnight (approx. 16 h) followed by incubation in 80%, 100% and 100% THF solutions for at least 1 h. Longer incubations do not necessarily improve the clearing process.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_871_4.csv\nCritical: THF is an organic solvent that forms peroxides upon long term storage increasing the risk of explosion. This process can be suppressed by adding butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) as a stabilizer. BHT removes the free radicals required for peroxide formation. The solvent quoted in the resource table contains BHT stabilizer. Old stock solutions should be avoided (stocks should not be used for more than 2 weeks) or checked meticulously for peroxide levels using peroxide strips.\nRemoval of lipids",
    "The sample is transferred into 100% Dichloromethane (DCM) for 20 min or until it sinks at RT.\nNote: THF-dehydrated tissue floats when it is placed in DCM. At the end of this step, the sample must sink. If the sample did not sink, lengthen the DCM step (step14). If the sample does not sink after 4 hours, it probably contains an air bubble in which case it is safe to proceed to the next step.\nClearing\nMove the sample to 100% Dibenzyl ether (DBE) overnight (approx. 16 h) at RT.\nNote: After DBE incubation, the sample must be transparent, having the same refraction index as DBE (1.56) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/871-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Clearing of postnatal mouse brain tissue\n(A and B) (A) Uncleared P0 brain sample, and (B) P0 brain sample cleared using 3DISCO. The borders of the cleared brain are indicated with a dashed line. Scale bar = 2 mm\nPause point: The sample can be stored in DBE at RT in brown glass vials until imaging. The sample must not be stored in the fridge, otherwise it loses its clarity and will become opaque. In our experience the samples can be stored for months without a significant decrease in staining intensity, although we had some rare examples in which this was not the case. It is therefore advisable to image your samples within a couple of weeks after finishing tissue clearing.\nUltramicroscopy imaging\nTiming: 1 hour (E13.5 brain) / 4 hours (P0 brain)\nMicroscope calibration: check whether the alignment of the light sheets has been recently evaluated and adjusted with the alignment tool (150-000-520). See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section.\nCheck for sufficient clearing solution in the chamber. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section.",
    "Critical: The light sheet objective should always be handled with a dipping cap to avoid damage to the lens (unless a special DBE resistant lens is used). Handling DBE should be done with utmost care. Any spillage of the fluid onto the stepping motor located below the clearing solution chamber will cause damage.\nDeciding on optimal sample orientation and mounting method: A number of points are to be considered when deciding on sample orientation and mounting. Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] summarizes a few critical points.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/871-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Mounting of brain samples\n(A and B) Mounting of samples as in A and B allows excitation light to pass through the width and length of the brain, respectively. In A the distance excitation light has to travel is shorter and therefore this way of tissue mounting is ideal for imaging. The arrows indicate the direction of the incident light.\n(C and D) Dopamine (DA) neurons are located in the ventral midbrain. Therefore, it could be an option to mount the brain sample such that the medial sulcus is up and the cortex down (C) which reduces the distance emitted light (arrow) has to travel to the lens. In D, emitted light has to travel a long distance in the brain tissue.\n(E–G) DA neurons should be present within the working distance (wd) of the objective following mounting (E). If the sample is not trimmed well, e.g., when cleared in an agarose block (F), or mounted in the incorrect manner (G), the DA system will not be positioned entirely within wd.",
    "Although the tissue sample is cleared, longer paths of the excitation light through the sample will lead to more diffraction. It is therefore important to mount the sample such that the propagation length of the excitation light is as short as possible (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B).\nIf the region of interest (ROI) is located on one side of the sample, the sample should be mounted such that the ROI is at the top. This minimizes the depth the emitted light has to propagate through the sample to reach the objective (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C and 3D).\nThe sample should be oriented such that imaging the full ROI does not exceed the working distance of the objective. (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E–3G).\nNote: Moving the sample too close to the objective may cause tissue damage, tissue dropping from the sample holder or damage to the dipping cap. When the step motor is moved to the lowest Z position, the sample should not extend above the sheet thereby making it difficult for the user to predict the actual working distance (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F and 3G).\nSample alignment should be chosen in accordance with the alignment of the laser scan as this significantly impacts the quality of the final scan. The quality of the 3D reconstruction will be higher in the XY plane as compared to the XZ and YZ planes. The axial (Z) resolution is limited by the thickness of the sheet.\nChoice of sample holders (See Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] for a comparison of samples holders).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/871-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Comparison of sample holders\nDifferences between sample holders and (dis)advantages of the different holders.",
    "Note: There must be clear rules for which parts of the Ultramicroscope can be handled with/without gloves. For instance, users should handle sample mounting with gloves and the microscope without gloves to keep it free of clearing solution.\nNote: Small samples that are challenging to mount with screw holders or with glue can be embedded in 1% agarose to facilitate mounting. It is important to perform the embedding before tissue dehydration after the immunostaining. Agarose embedding can cause tissue damage, in our experience, embedding works well for spinal cords and organoids and less for embryos and embryonic brains. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section.\nGently but firmly mount the brain in the sample holder and lower it into the cuvette of the microscope. Pay attention to the force applied to the sample while securing it in the holder. The sample has the consistency of glass and with higher forces it can crack. On the other hand, if not firmly done, the sample runs the risk of dropping out when immersed into the clearing solution when not firmly put in the sample holder.\nSwitch-on one visible laser with low laser power (10–20%) and high exposure time. Subsequently, move the sample in the Z direction until the light sheet is on top of the sample. This is done to minimize the risk of crashing the objective into the sample while lowering the objective into the clearing solution.\nChoose the width of the light sheet and check whether the entire sample is illuminated.\nFigure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] shows the relationship between sheet width and sample coverage while imaging.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/871-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Relationship between sheet-width and sample coverage",
    "The relationship between sheet-width and sample coverage is shown here. 30% sheet width illuminates the entire sample (E13 mouse embryo) in this example showing complete sample coverage (A) whereas 10% sheet width covers only the middle aspect of the sample (B).\n(A and B) show sample coverage with sheet width used.\n(C and D) show corresponding autofluorescence images made with the Ultramicroscope II using sample settings as in A and B, respectively. Scale bar = 300 μm.\nNote: By default, the tissue sample is illuminated by three beams: one central beam and two lateral beams projected at a small angle. The lateral beams can minimize artifacts, like horizontal dark stripes, caused for instance by air bubbles or pigmentation. The use of lateral beams, however, comes at the cost of axial (Z) resolution. This is because the waists (this is where the beam is thinnest, the Gaussian beam stops converging here and starts diverging) of the three beams can be aligned to each other only in the center of the field of view (FOV). When the three beams are combined, the sheet will only keep the same thin waist over the same length in the center of the FOV, at the top and the bottom of the FOV the thin waist will be significantly shorter (for a detailed description of this phenomenon see Ariel, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).",
    "Use the camera to focus (the microscope does not have an ocular). Once inside the clearing solution, use the min-max intensity function (accessible with F9-F10 in keyboard or via icon as shown in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]) to visualize the sample and adjust the focus in small steps. The min/max function changes the scaling of the colormap such that the lowest pixel on the displayed image is set as the lower boundary and the highest pixel as the upper boundary of the color map.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/871-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Software icons used for imaging and analysis\nImages of icons as they appear in the graphical user interface (GUI) of the software are shown here. The corresponding software and the function of the icon is also indicated.\nNote: In order to prevent excessive movement in Z while inspecting the sample, it is possible to mark the upper side of your sample as “0” using the “set as zero” button, like this it can be easily monitored, if the current position does not exceed the working distance.\nPerform a sample inspection at low laser power to check the quality of the sample. (See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section for possible solutions).\nNote: If the sample is well cleared and has small dimensions, the sample can be imaged unidirectionally. The alignment of the right and left image is never perfect, even after calibration of the microscope. For estimating if illumination from one side is ideal, the horizontal focus can be moved to the outer edge of the sample away from the illumination direction of the sheet to check if the sample is still in focus at this position. Using unidirectional illumination also significantly decreases scanning time.",
    "Note: For quantitative comparisons of different brain samples, microscope configuration and settings that may influence intensity values and imaging resolution must be applied consistently (e.g. between wild type and knockout brains). This includes settings of the diaphragm of the zoom-body, type of dipping cap, exposure time, laser power, light sheet width, light sheet NA, magnification, and step-size (See Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_871_5.csv\naExplanation of sample name: (name staining method (in this example 3DISCO), date in YYYY-MM-DD format (for optimal sorting files) this was the date the staining started, sample number, age, genotype).\nbFor the file name of the image, the sample (code) name was used, so it could be easily traced back in a digital lab journal, additionally the zoombody magnification was added to the name.\nNote: In this setup two types of dipping caps can be used: a standard (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A) and a correction (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B) dipping cap. With the standard dipping cap, the diaphragm should be opened half-way in order to reduce the strong spherical aberration that is caused by this type of dipping cap. The correction dipping cap incorporates a lens to correct spherical aberrations allowing the diaphragm to be fully open. The correction dipping cap has a shorter working distance (5.7mm instead of 10mm).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/871-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Dipping caps\nA standard dipping cap (A) allows light to pass through without correction for spherical aberration. A correction dipping cap contains a lens that corrects for spherical aberration when light passes through (B).\nSet the objective correction collar to the appropriate position (3.5 for correction dipping cap and 5 for standard dipping cap).",
    "Select the instrument mode which matches the objective/dipping cap and hereafter choose the appropriate magnification of the zoombody and zoom in the software. This is very important since processes like dynamic focus position and scaling are determined by both settings (See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section for more details).\nSelect the correct mode of measurement (e.g., 3D acquisition, Multi-color 3D). For multi-color imaging, select the appropriate laser/filter combinations.\nDetermine the appropriate sheet NA. A higher NA results in a thinner light sheet but only in a small region near the light sheet focus. A lower NA results in a thicker light sheet but a more even axial (Z) resolution over the FOV. In order to get a high axial (Z) resolution with a high sheet NA over the whole FOV use dynamic horizontal focusing (See step 31).\nEnter the step-size in the “Scan Range”. As a general rule of thumb, the value used is half the thickness of the sheet. (For example, with a sheet thickness of 5 μM, a step size of 2.5 μM was used). Choosing a too small step-size will lead to oversampling, longer imaging time and increased risk of bleaching without improving the axial (Z) resolution. A too large step-size on the other hand will cause decreased axial (Z) resolution. It is advisable to experiment with several step-sizes and check the axial resolution by inspecting the scan in XZ and YZ orientation.\nStart with focusing on the dye with the lowest wavelength. For the best focus put the horizontal focus on a thin feature in the image (such as axons), zoom in digitally and adjust focus.\nAdjust the focus of the other channels by adapting the chromatic correction settings (via icon shown in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).",
    "Select “Dynamic focus” in order to get an even axial (Z) resolution over the whole FOV. Select the dynamic focus range and adjust it until it covers the full ROI. Based on this (and factors like magnification, instrument mode etc.) the number of horizontal focus steps necessary to achieve a homogeneous axial (Z) resolution is approximated. The more horizontal focus steps, the longer the image acquisition time. It is therefore wise to experiment with different numbers of steps before applying one to all the samples to be compared in a dataset.\nAfter all the parameters are set for the experiment, set exposure time and laser power for imaging. Ideally for imaging exposure time is low (in order to decrease imaging time) and laser power just enough to image the signal without causing bleaching. Illumination intensity is not only determined by the laser power, but also by sheet width and sheet NA.\nChoose a contrast range for your image. High contrast images are facilitated by having a broad range of grayscales in the image. How broad this range should be, depends on whether the signal-to-background ratio is high enough to depict/analyze the staining well.",
    "To be able to use the full range of your camera while not overexposing the sample, use the following strategy: 1) Choose a color map in the Imspector software in which the pixel with the highest intensity is depicted in another color (In the colormap shown in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6] the most intense pixel is depicted in blue), 2) Now set the upper boundary of the colormap to 65534 (The Andor camera is a 16-bit camera with 216 gray values. Because 0 is also counted as a gray value (black) the formula should be 216-1 = 65535, but because of a software bug the highest pixel (blue pixel in our case) is not shown in that color. Therefore, subtract one extra gray value 216-2 = 65534), and 3) Now change the exposure time and or laser power such that the staining is clearly depicted while there is no overexposure throughout the sample (seen by the blue pixel). Aiming for the highest contrast can come at the cost of imaging time and/or at the risk of bleaching.\nIt is highly recommended to autosave the scan (in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6] it is shown as enabled or disabled) with a unique code and magnification details. The filepath (this includes folders) should be <256 characters, without spaces to avoid processing errors in image analysis software. The date and time are automatically saved in the image name.\nNote: In the advanced setting for autosave, select “Add meta data only to first image of series”. This will reduce the overall scan size. However, it is important to note that this first tiff image should be used to open your data with proper scaling.\nImaris™-based analysis of DA neuron subset position and migration\nTiming: 2–6 hours/brain (Analysis time is influenced by experience)",
    "Using Imaris™ software, the DA system of the ventral midbrain is selectively visualized and Citrine+ SN neurons positioned in this area are detected. These neurons are divided in groups based on their relative position to a reference frame in the X, Y, and Z axes. The number of neurons in each group is determined. When performed at different developmental stages, this procedure allows analysis of the migration of Citrine+ SN neurons.\nBelow the analysis procedure is explained in detail. Snapshots of the steps involved are shown in Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]. The complete procedure, as described below, can also be viewed in an instructional video (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/871-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8.

Bins can be created equidistant to each other from a reference frame and these can be individually analyzed in multiple directions.

    "In this video the complete analysis as described in the chapter “Demonstration of Imaris™ based analysis of DA neuron subset position and migration” is shown using a whole-mount and 3DISCO cleared, TH and Citrine immunostained ACTB-Flpe:Pitx3-ITC P0 mouse brain imaged with a Ultramicroscope II. Related to step 36-42.\nWe used Imaris™ software, but technically it should be possible to perform these kinds of analysis with other software packages (e.g., Fiji or Aivia™).\nConvert file formats to facilitate the analysis.\nConvert acquired light sheet files (ome.tiffs) to Imaris™ file (.ims) format by using ‘Imaris™ File Converter’, by dragging and dropping the first file of the Z stack (Z0000) to the file converter.

    "Visualization of the DA system in 3D. (See Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1], 0:01:20) The ‘Surfaces’ visualization creates an artificial solid object within a volume object in order to visualize/manipulate these objects in isolation. In our case, this procedure consists of manual drawing of a surface using TH immunostaining as template to isolate the DA system.\nNote: According to our experience, automatic creation of a surface does not allow a complete and specific selection of the DA system. Once the surface is created by manual drawing as explained below, a new channel is created wherein the voxels outside the DA system are set to zero and become black.\nOpen the image in 3D view (as above) and add a ‘Surface’ (3D view> Surface). (Icon shown in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6])\nIn the surface wizard, select ‘Skip automatic creation, edit manually’ and deselect the ‘Volume’’ function. This enables the user to visualize the ‘Slice View’ function which is necessary for drawing the mask of the DA system.\nThe camera type should be in the ‘Orthogonal’ mode (instead of ‘Perspective’) to keep the image in a straight position.\nSelect the ‘Draw’ tab and, using the slice position slider, determine the position where the boundary of the area containing TH-positive cells is clearly defined.\nPick the drawing mode, depending on the staining/task. In our study the ‘Click’ function selected.\nFirst adjust the mode of the pointer from ‘Navigate’ to ‘Select’ by pressing Esc and then select ‘Draw’.\nNote: It is not always necessary to draw at each slice position. It is possible to skip several planes depending on how much the boundary of the TH-positive area changes in shape among different planes. In this example, we skip between 5-20 slice positions (Figures 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]A–9C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/871-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. 3D rendering of the TH-positive dopamine (DA) system",
    "(A–C) The generation of multiple cross-sectional drawings (B) allows 3D rendering of the entire TH-positive DA system (sample shown is of a P0 brain) (A). In C, each line represents a single cross-sectional border drawing. Sagittal view.\n(D–F) The use of fewer cross-sectional drawings (E and F) allows the generation of a basic structure (D), which can be fine-tuned by adding more cross-sections at levels where more details are needed, as judged by visual inspection.\n(G and H). Representation of TH boundaries showing only the plane being drawn (visibility “None” mode; G) or showing all planes drawn (visibility “All” mode; H) in one field of view. Scale bars = 100 μm.\nDraw with a left mouse click. If a point is not placed well, it can be moved by turning off ‘Draw’ and pressing ‘T+left click’. Also, additional points can be added by activating ‘Draw’ and pressing ‘T+left click’.\nWhen the first plane is drawn, move to the next slice position and repeat the same process (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B).\nNote: While drawing TH boundaries in different planes it is helpful to simultaneously visualize the drawings in other slices. This can be achieved using the ‘Contour > Board’ subtab of the ‘Draw’ tab by putting the ‘Visibility’ to ‘All’ or ‘Next’ to see all or only see the previous drawn slice(s), respectively (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]H). When ‘Visibility’ is changed to ‘None’ only the drawing in the current plane is visualized (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]G).\nWhen the complete ROI is drawn press ‘Create Surface’ (Resolution, shape and impact values were unchanged in our analysis) (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]C).",
    "Note: Sometimes the quality of immunostaining in one hemisphere is low, in this case it is possible to use only one half for analysis by digitally sectioning the surface in half. To divide the surface into two halves, select the ‘Edit’ tab and put the pointer on ‘Select’ mode (Esc). Then press ‘Shift+left click’ on the position you want to split and select ‘Cut Surface’. The cutting function works only when the ‘Edit’ tab is active.\nSetting coordinates for the DA system. (See Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1], 0:04:53) In order to facilitate data analysis of different samples, 3D brains were oriented and aligned along a specific spatial coordinate. For this the ‘Reference frame’ function was used. Reference frames are orthogonal coordinate systems that can be positioned manually to mark coordinates in the 3D space.\nSelect ‘Reference Frame’ (3D View> Reference Frame). The reference frame will appear in the upper left corner of the image. (Icon shown in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6])\nTo move the Reference frame to the correct position, select ‘Navigate’ mode (Esc)∗. Then press ‘Ctrl+right click’. In order to orient the reference frame to the desired location, rotate the reference frame by pressing ‘Ctrl+left click’ and move it with the click and drag function of the mouse.",
    "Critical: It is important to choose histological landmarks that are uniform between samples in order to be able to perform this analysis. For example, for medio-lateral quantification of DA neuron migration the midline along the ventricles was chosen to set the reference frame (Figures 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]C and 10D). For dorso-ventral quantification, the most upper edge of the ventricles was chosen as the histological landmark (Figures 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]E and 10F). For rostro-caudal quantification, the most caudal point of the TH mask was the selected histological landmark (Figures 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]G and 10H). One reference frame/sample for all axes was used throughout the analysis.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/871-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10. 3D rendering of the dopamine (DA) system and ventricular system in the P0 brain\n(A and B) Front (A) and side (B) views of the P0 brain with the TH-positive DA system shown in red and the ventricular system shown in gray.\nThe boxed area in A is shown at higher magnification in (C). The ventricular structure at the midline acts as a histological landmark for setting the central image plane from which equidistant planes are drawn until the ventral-most TH-positive point. This enables medio-lateral position analysis by creating bins (b1-6) as shown in (D). The boxed area in B is shown at a higher magnification in (E). The top edge of the ventricular structure and the upper edge of medial sulcus act as a histological landmark for setting the top and bottom image planes within which equidistant planes are drawn for creating dorso-ventral bins (b1-7) as shown in (F). For rostro-caudal analysis, the rostral-most and ventral-most TH-positive points are used to draw the boundary image planes (G and H) and between these equidistant planes are drawn (b1-4).",
    "Note: Imaging without any staining in the 488 nm channel can be used to aid the identification of the above-said histological landmarks (due to the high level of autofluorescence in this channel).\nAdding ‘Planes’, by ticking the ‘Visible’ checkbox in the ‘Reference Frame’ wizard in xy, xz and yz axes can help to visually cross-check if the orientation and rotation angle of the reference frame is set as desired.\nPlace the reference frame at the most medial, caudal, ventral position of the surface and take care that the axes are aligned properly so they resample the medio-lateral, rostro-caudal and dorsal-ventral positions.\nIsolating the DA system for analysis. (See Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1], 0:05:59) The creation of a masked channel allows defining a region of interest (ROI) by nullifying voxels outside the mask such that they are ignored for further analysis. This allows analysis of Citrine+ cells only within the TH+ DA system, as voxels outside the TH mask are excluded from analysis.\nSelect the (split) surface you are going to use for analysis, by placing the pointer in the ‘Select’ mode (Esc) and then left-click on that part of the surface (the selected area should turn yellow). In the surface wizard, with the ‘Edit’ tab active, choose ‘Mask Selection’.\nSelect the channel that needs the masking function. In our case, this is the channel for the Citrine staining which needs to be masked. Select ‘Mask Settings’>’Constant Inside/Outside’. After this, select ‘Set Voxels Outside Surface to’ and put 0.000 in the text box. This will create an additional channel, in which the intensity of the voxels that are outside the surface are set to zero.",
    "A new channel is created in order to inspect the masked channel, open the ‘Display Adjustment’ window with ‘Ctrl+D’ (or Edit>Show Display Adjustment), turn off other channels and select ‘Volume’ function.\nNote: The same procedure can be repeated for the TH channel. This step is not necessary for data analysis but helps to examine how well the mask was prepared and can help with data display. (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]D)\nQuantification of Citrine+ cells in the DA system. (See Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1], 0:07:39) Spot detection provides a procedure to automatically detect and visualize point-like structures, and provide quantitative output of these structures. The Citrine+ cells in this ROI can be detected with spot analysis function.\nStart the ‘Spots’ wizard (3D View> Spots). (Icon shown in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6])\nPerform spot analysis on the whole image. If the dataset is large, it is possible to select ‘Segment only a Region of Interest’ and followed by ‘Process entire image finally’.\nAt page 2 of the ‘Spots’ analysis wizard (blue arrow), select the non-masked channel for Citrine staining.\nNote: When the analysis is performed in the masked channel, there is a sharp contrast between voxels within and outside the mask creating many false positive spots at the edges of the mask. For this reason, a non-masked Citrine channel was used for spot detection.\nCell detection is facilitated by estimating the spot diameter in ‘Slice view’ (Ctrl+1) by measuring the diameter of a couple of cells by drawing a line between 2 extremes of a neuron cell body. Then enter the average value in ‘estimated XY diameter’. In our analysis the diameter used was 6 μm.",
    "Note: Since objects smaller than the estimated diameter are not detected as spots it is better to under- than overestimate cell size. For spot estimation, size variation in the desired cell population should not be too high, otherwise underestimation of cell diameter can result in multiple spots generated within a single large cell thereby skewing data analysis.\nDeselect ‘Model PSF-elongation along the Z-axis’. The Gaussian shape of the light sheet beam renders it nearly impossible to calculate point spread. Therefore, we choose to not model PSF in this analysis.\nSelect ‘Background Subtraction’ to smoothen the image by creating a Gaussian filtered channel minus the intensity of the original channel.\nNote: For spot detection, a Gaussian filtered copy of the selected channel is created which uses a ratio of ¾ of the radius of the entered ‘Estimated Diameter’, to smoothen the image. When background subtraction is enabled a second Gaussian filtered copy of the original channel is made which uses a ratio of 8/9 of the radius of the entered ‘Estimated Diameter’. The second Gaussian blurred copy (8/9) is subtracted from the first blurred copy (3/4). This works as a difference of gaussians (DoG) algorithm and is useful for enhancing edges in the image and the suppression of noise.\nPage 3 of the spot analysis wizard (blue arrow) provides options to filter the spots. By default, the quality filter is selected. In addition to the quality filter (>300), we also added an intensity max (> 1500 on masked channel) and mean filter (>1000 on masked channel).",
    "Note: When background subtraction is disabled, the quality filter algorithm uses the intensity of the ¾ radius Gaussian filter channel (as described above). When background subtraction is enabled, it uses the intensity of the 2 subtracted gaussian filtered channels (DoG algorithm). The intensity is taken for the central voxels at a radius of 8/9 of the ‘Estimated Diameter’. Since the goal is to detect Citrine+ cells within the mask, we increased the stringency of spot detection by introducing two additional parameters for error-free spot detection. The intensity max selects cells with a certain brightness and intensity mean ensuring that the brightness value is spread over a defined cell area and is not a false positive pixel.\nClick on the green arrow to execute all the creation steps and to terminate the wizard. (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]E)\nCritical: Place the reference frame before performing spot detection. (See Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section).\nSpot segmentation along reference frame and analysis of Citrine+ subset within the DA system. (See Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1], 0:10:14) This step provides information about the relative position of spots with respect to the reference frame. The reference frame rightly placed along x-y-z axes can provide data on the distribution of Citrine+ cells along the medio-lateral, rostro-caudal and dorso-ventral axis within the ROI (SN and VTA).\nThe positional distance from the reference frame can be derived using the ‘Statistics’ tab in the spots menu, by selecting ‘Position Reference Frame’ from the dropdown menu (Statistics>Detailed>Position Reference Frame).\nSelect ‘Export Statistics on Tab Display to File’. Export as .xls or .csv. (Icon shown in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6])",
    "In the spreadsheet you will find the distance from the reference frame in all axes divided over three columns. These data can be used to make subgroups based on their distance from the reference frame. To be able to make subgroups based on their relative position from the reference frame it is necessary to determine which point along the axes of interest should be considered the end point. Measure the length of this axis by manually placing spots on the most lateral, rostral or ventral position of the surface.\nTo measure the medial-lateral axis, open a new spots object (3D View> Spots).\nThen select ‘Skip automatic creation, edit manually’.\nGo to the ‘edit’ tab and select ‘Surface of Object’. This ensures that the spot is nicely placed on the outside of the surface.\nPress ‘Shift+left click’ to place the spot.\nFrom the ‘Statistics’ tab > ‘Selection’ tab, choose ‘Position Reference Frame’ from the dropdown menu. Retrieve the value for the specific axis you want to measure.\nThe retrieved value is then used to subdivide the cells (spots) in groups/bins, to determine exact number of Citrine+ cells in each bin.\nRepeat this procedure for the other axes.\nGraphical display of segmented groups within the DA system (optional). (See Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1], 0:12:41) If a graphical display of the subgroups is desired, Imaris™ can be used to color-code each group using the following steps.\nUse the ‘Filter’ tab within spots to create new groups.\nThen add filter ‘Position X Reference frame’ or ‘Position Y Reference frame’ or ‘Position Z Reference frame’, to create medio-lateral, dorso-ventral and rostro-caudal subgroups, respectively.",
    "Determine the distances from the reference frame for each bin. For instance, for medial-lateral subgroups we used the most lateral position of the surface and the midline (medial position defined by the reference frame) and divided this region into 8 bins.\nIn the upper threshold text box, enter the value of the farthest distance from the reference frame. In the lower threshold text box, enter the value of the nearest distance from the reference frame and click on ‘Duplicate Selection to new Spots’.\nContinue this action until there is a new subset for all bins created.\nFor the sake of clarity all these groups can be put in one folder (3D View > Group). After the folder is created the spot subgroups can be manually dragged into this folder.\nEach subgroup can now be color-coded by a unique color by clicking on ‘Color’ tab, selecting ‘base’ and a unique color. (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]F)\nRepeat this procedure for the dorso-ventral (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]G) and rostro-caudal axis (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]H).\nNote: Since version 9.6 of Imaris™ (July 2020) the division into groups can also be done at once, by selecting the classify spots function in the spot wizard. But the method described above can also still be used."
