    "All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of North Carolina State University.\n1. Room set-up and study subject acclimatization\nPerform QST in a dedicated space where there is ample room for a QST operator, handler, and dog of any size to move about comfortably. Minimize potential auditory and visual distractions and use a white noise machine to block out ambient sound.\nPlace a large yoga mat or similar padding on the floor to ensure that the dogs are comfortable in lateral recumbency during testing.\nAllow the dog at least 10 min to freely explore and acclimate to the room and become comfortable with the QST operator and handler. Offer fresh water ad libitum in the room, and give occasional food rewards.\nRandomize the testing site (left or right side) by a coin flip. Clip an approximately 2 x 4 cm section of fur centered around the space between the dorsal surface of the third and fourth metatarsals halfway between the tarsometatarsal joint and the metatarsophalangeal joint. Clip an approximately 1 x 2 cm fur section on the lateral antebrachium just proximal to the antebrachiocarpal joint over the ulna.\n2. Electronic von Frey anesthesiometer\nInstrument set-up\n\t\nGently apply a rigid 0.9 mm von Frey tip to the load cell and ensure that the load cell is securely screwed into the handpiece. Connect the cord from the handpiece to the recording device through the M0 channel (Figure 1A,B).\nTurn on the recording device and press the MAX button so that the device will record and display the maximum force achieved when the dog responds to the applied stimulus (Figure 1C).\nZero the instrument by pressing the CLR button.\nData collection\n\t\nPlace the dog in lateral recumbency for measuring thresholds.",
    "NOTE: Dogs are placed in right lateral recumbency for measuring thresholds on the left limbs or placed in left lateral recumbency for measuring thresholds on the right limbs. If the dog will not willingly lay in lateral recumbency when given verbal cues, the QST operator and handler can manually lay the dog in lateral recumbency.\nApply minimal to moderate restraint as needed to maintain the dog in lateral recumbency and relatively still.\n\t\tNOTE: The handler performs this step.\nApply the stimulus once the dog is calm and relaxed and the limb being tested is in at least 70% extension. Provide gentle manual support to the limb being tested to keep the limb off the floor and provide stable backing to apply force against while not preventing the dog from withdrawing the limb.\n\t\tNOTE: The QST operator performs this step.\nApply the von Frey tip perpendicular to the skin of the area being tested. If the dog exhibits reflex movements (e.g., twitching of the paw or withdrawal of the limb before force is being applied) from the sensation of the von Frey tip on the skin, allow the dog to relax the limb again before reapplying the von Frey tip. Take a measurement when the skin does not cause reflex movements by applying the von Frey tip.\nApply steadily increasing force with the von Frey tip (~20 g/sec) until the dog withdraws the limb, vocalizes, turns to look at the stimulus, or exhibits other movements or behavioral responses that indicate the conscious perception of the stimulus. Remove the stimulus when the dog withdraws the limb, or the maximum force is reached.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not exceed 1,000 g of force.\nRecord the maximum force applied that is displayed on the recording device.",
    "NOTE: If the safety cut-off of 1,000 g of force is reached, 1,000 g is recorded as the sensory threshold, and it is noted that there was no response before the safety cut-off.\nRepeat the measurements for a total of five trials, allowing 1 min between each measurement (inter-trial interval). Zero the instrument between each step by pressing the CLR button.\n\t\t\nAllow the dog to remain in lateral recumbency during the inter-trial intervals if they remain relatively calm and relaxed with no or minimal restraint. Otherwise, allow the dog to sit, stand, or move about the QST room to maintain their comfort. Place the dog back in lateral recumbency before the subsequent measurement.\nRecord a feasibility score of 0-5 to indicate the ease with which the data was collected.\n\t\tNOTE: Feasibility scores are as follows: 0 = no problem, 1 = mild difficulty, 2 = moderate difficulty, 3 = significant difficulty, 4 = extremely difficult, 5 = impossible. The rubric used for assigning feasibility scores is provided in Table 1.\nGive the dog a 5 min break before starting measurements with the blunt probed pressure algometer.\n3. Blunt probed pressure algometer\nInstrument set-up\n\t\nEnsure that the small blunt probe is securely screwed into the device (Figure 2A).\nTurn on the recording device and press the MAX button to continue when prompted on the screen. Press the UNIT button until the unit is displayed as grams (g) at the top of the screen (Figure 2B).\nZero the instrument by pressing the ZERO button.\nData collection\n\t\nPlace the dog in lateral recumbency for measuring thresholds.",

If the dog exhibits reflex movements (e.g., twitching of the paw or withdrawal of the limb before force is being applied) from the sensation of the blunt probe on the skin, allow the dog to relax the limb again before reapplying the blunt probe. Take a measurement when the application of the blunt probe to the skin does not cause reflex movements.\nApply steadily increasing force with the probe (~20 g/s) until the dog withdraws the limb, vocalizes, turns to look at the stimulus, or exhibits other movements or behavioral responses that indicate the conscious perception of the stimulus. Remove the stimulus when the dog withdraws the limb or the maximum force is reached.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not exceed 2,500 g of force.\nRecord the maximum force applied that is displayed on the recording device.",
    "NOTE: If the safety cut-off of 2,500 g of force is reached, 2,500 g is recorded as the sensory threshold, and it is noted that there was no response before the safety cut-off.\nRepeat the measurements for a total of five trials, allowing 1 min between each measure (inter-trial interval). Zero the instrument between each step by pressing the ZERO button.\n\t\t\nAllow the dog to remain in lateral recumbency during the inter-trial interval if they remain relatively calm and relaxed with no or minimal restraint. Otherwise, allow the dog to sit, stand, or move about the QST room to maintain their comfort.Â Place the dog back in lateral recumbency before the subsequent measurement.\nRecord a feasibility score of 0-5 to indicate the ease with which the data was collected.\n\t\tNOTE: Feasibility scores are as follows: 0 = no problem, 1 = mild difficulty, 2 = moderate difficulty, 3 = significant difficulty, 4 = extremely difficult, 5 = impossible.\nGive the dog a 5 min break before starting measurements with the hot thermal probe.\n4. Hot thermal probe\nInstrument set-up\n\t\nConnect the thermosensory analyzer to the computer via the USB cable and ensure that the 16 x 16 mm thermode is connected to the analyzer. Turn on the analyzer.\nOpen the thermosensory analyzer software on the computer and select the TSA II analyzer from the startup menu. Click on OK on the pop-up warning for the analyzer self-test. Ensure that the thermode is not connected to the study subject during the self-test.\nIn the TEST tab (upper right-hand corner), under the Select Patient prompt (left-hand side of the screen), select the appropriate patient by double-clicking on the name in the list.",
    "To create a new patient, click on the PATIENTS tab to the right of the TEST tab. Click on the New Patient icon in the lower left-hand corner and fill in the patient details (department, patient first and last name, ID, gender, and date of birth).\nUnder the Select Program prompt in the TEST tab, select the appropriate program by double-clicking on the program in the list.\n\t\t\nTo create a new program, single-click on the PROGRAMS tab to the right of the PATIENTS tab. Click on the New Program icon in the lower left-hand corner and fill in the program details.\n\t\t\tNOTE: For this protocol, the program details are given in Table 2. A body site does not need to be selected under the Select Body Site prompt in the TEST tab.\nOnce the appropriate patient and program have been selected, click on the Go to Test prompt under the TEST tab. Single click on the Pre-Test button in the lower left-hand corner to calibrate the analyzer to the specified program.\nOnce the Pre-Test is complete, the Pre-Test button is replaced by the Start button, and the test window displays: Press Start button to start the test (Figure 3A).\nUnwind the thermode cable and ensure that the thermode is easily accessible.\nData collection\n\t\nPlace the dog in lateral recumbency for measuring thermal latency.\n\t\tNOTE: Dogs are placed in right lateral recumbency for measuring thresholds on the left limbs or placed in left lateral recumbency for measuring thresholds on the right limbs. If the dog will not willingly lay in lateral recumbency when given verbal cues, the QST operator and handler can manually lay the dog in lateral recumbency.\nApply minimal to moderate restraint as needed to maintain the dog in lateral recumbency and relatively still.",
    "NOTE: The handler performs this step.\nApply the stimulus once the dog is calm and relaxed and the limb being tested is in approximately 70% extension. Provide gentle manual support to the limb being tested to keep the limb off the floor while not preventing the dog from withdrawing the limb. Also, hold and operate a stopwatch with the hand supporting the limb.\n\t\tNOTE: The QST operator performs this step.\nApply the thermode to the skin of the area being tested (Figure 3B). If the dog exhibits reflex movements (e.g., twitching of the paw or withdrawal of the limb before heat is being applied) from the sensation of the thermode on the skin, allow the dog to relax the limb again before reapplying the thermode. Take a measurement when the application of the thermode to the skin does not cause reflex movements.\nClick on the Start button in the lower left-hand corner of the TEST tab to start the test.\n\t\tNOTE: The QST operator signals to the handler to start the test (e.g., by nodding their head), and the QST operator simultaneously starts the stopwatch.\nRemove the thermode when the dog withdraws the limb, vocalizes, turns to look at the stimulus, or exhibits other movements or behavioral responses that indicate the conscious perception of the stimulus or when the maximum latency is reached while simultaneously stopping the stopwatch.\n\t\tNOTE: The QST operator performs this step. Do not exceed 20 s of thermode application or 49 Â°C of maximum thermode temperature.\nRecord the latency to withdrawal. If the safety cut-off of 20 s of thermode application is reached, record 20 s as the sensory latency, and note that there was no response before the safety cut-off.",
    "Repeat the measurements for a total of five trials, allowing 1 min between each measure (inter-trial interval). Click on the End Test button, and then the Pre-Test button between each measurement to stop heating the thermode and recalibrate the thermode to prepare for the next application.\n\t\tNOTE: The handler performs this step.\n\t\t\nAllow the dog to remain in lateral recumbency during the inter-trial interval if they remain relatively calm and relaxed with no or minimal restraint. Otherwise, allow the dog to sit, stand, or move about the QST room to maintain their comfort.Â Place the dog back in lateral recumbency before the subsequent measurement.\nRecord a feasibility score of 0-5 to indicate the ease with which the data was collected.\n\t\tNOTE: Feasibility scores are as follows: 0 = no problem, 1 = mild difficulty, 2 = moderate difficulty, 3 = significant difficulty, 4 = extremely difficult, 5 = impossible.\nSubscription Required.
