    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nFine needle aspiration\nTiming: 30–60 min (for steps 1–6)\nIn this step of the protocol, ultrasound is used to identify superficial lateral axillary lymph nodes in donors. The lymph node to biopsy is selected based on accessibility, larger size/cortical thickness, and relative distance to the surface of the skin. If no lateral lymph node is accessible, a central lymph node may be biopsied instead, however, posterior and/or apical lymph nodes are never sampled. Once a suitable lymph node is identified, ultrasound guidance is used to insert the tip of the needle into the lymph node and gently aspirate lymphoid cells from the cortex. After aspiration, the specimen is expelled from the syringe into ice cold media to collect the cells. FNAs are performed similar to those reported in Havenar-Daughton et al. (2020),8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] with a few minor differences highlighted below.\nPrior to the FNA procedure, prepare the collection syringes by attaching a 25-gauge needle to a 10 mL syringe and withdraw the plunger to pull 1 mL of air into the syringe.\nNote: This helps to eject the specimen. A separate sterile needle/syringe is prepared for each pass (5 total).\nNote: In the original protocol,8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] a 22-, 25-, or 27-gauge needle along with a 3 mL or 5 mL syringe were all successfully used. We opt to consistently use a 25-gauge needle with a 10 mL syringe.\nUse an ultrasound instrument (Philips EPIQ ELITE or PHILIPS IU222) to visualize superficial axillary draining lymph nodes. Select the most accessible and best visualized lymph node for biopsy.\nClean the skin around the lymph node with 4% chlorhexidine gluconate solution, or another antiseptic solution. Anesthetize this area by injecting 2–6 mL of 0.9% buffered lidocaine solution.",
    "Under ultrasound guidance, place the tip of the 25-gauge needle into the cortex of the lymph node and move back and forth for 10–20 s to collect cells.\nEject the sample into the prepared tube of ice-cold Culture Media.\nThis step is considered as a single “pass”. See Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nNote: Negative pressure (light suction) is usually applied to the syringe in step 4 to increase the cell yield and is recommended in the original protocol.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] Suction should be released prior to removing the needle from the lymph node to avoid aspirating subcutaneous fat.\nRinse the needle with 1–2 mL of media to collect residual cells before disposal.\nPerform a total of five passes (as defined in step 4).\nNote: In the original protocol,8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] four lymph nodes, with a total of four passes each, were probed per donor. In our recent study, we opted for a single lymph node per donor with a total of five passes.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] In some donors, it can be difficult to visualize multiple lymph nodes that are accessible for FNA, thus a single lymph node per donor tends to be more feasible for collection.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Cine of an ultrasound guided FNA pass, related to step 4\nFlow cytometry\nTiming: 4–6 h (for steps 7–28)\nAfter the FNA is performed, cells are immediately processed and stained with fluorescent antibodies to identify B cell and T cell populations by spectral flow cytometry.\nPrepare single-color compensation controls.\nIn a V-bottom 96-well plate, set up an unstained control and a compensation control for the viability dye by adding 1 × 106 cells per well into two separate wells.",
    "Note: Since FNA cell recovery can be limiting, fresh PBMC or other human cells (e.g., tonsillar cells) can be used for these compensation controls.\nBring the volume of the well to 200 μL with FACS Buffer, then spin the plate at 400 × g for 2 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells with 100 μL of FACS Buffer (unstained control) or eBioscienceTM Fixable Viability Dye eFluorTM 780 diluted 1:4,000 in FACS Buffer (viability dye control). Keep the plate at 4°C (or on ice) until step 7g.\nFor the other single-color compensation controls, add 15 μL per well of UltraComp eBeadsTM Compensation Beads to the plate. One well is needed for each fluorochrome included in the panel.\nThe total volume of each well is brought to 100 μL by adding 85 μL of FACS Buffer.\nAdd 1 μL (or more) of each individual antibody to the appropriate wells.\nIncubate all controls at 4°C for 30 min.\nCritical: It is critical that, for each fluorochrome, the single-color compensation controls are as bright, or brighter, than the stained sample. For this reason, the concentration of the antibody used to stain the samples (see Stain Mix 1 and Stain Mix 2 tables for the suggested concentrations), is an appropriate starting point for staining the compensation beads. From there, the concentration may need to be adjusted depending on signal brightness (use lower concentration if the signal is too bright, or higher concentration if the signal is too dim).",
    "Note: The fluorescently labeled tetrameric B cell probes do not bind to these compensation beads. To set up compensation controls for the tetrameric probes, we instead stain compensation beads with an antibody conjugated to the same fluorochrome as the one conjugated to the probes (i.e., we use an anti-CD4-PE antibody as the single-color compensation control for the RBD-PE tetrameric probe). Importantly, if possible, tandem dyes should be avoided for making tetrameric probes as tandem dyes have a much higher variability from lot-to-lot (due to the dissolution of the tandem fluorochromes) and cannot be accurately compensated in this manner.\nAfter incubation, add 100 μL of FACS Buffer to each well and spin the plate at 400 × g for 2 min at 4°C.\nAspirate supernatant and wash the single-color compensation controls one additional time by adding 200 μL of FACS Buffer to each well and spin as above.\nResuspend the single-color compensation controls in 100–200 μL of FACS Buffer and use to set the compensation matrix on the spectral flow cytometer.\nNote: Single-color compensation controls can be prepared during any incubation steps.\nNote: Spectral flow cytometers, such as the Cytek Aurora, tend to be quite stable over time. For this reason, we have had success with acquiring single-color compensation controls once and reusing the same controls across multiple weeks to set the compensation matrix.",
    "Critical: If adopting the above strategy and staining fresh FNA samples on different days, the same selected frozen human sample should be used as an internal control for every new FNA sample acquisition. This internal control is used to validate the accuracy of the compensation matrix over time and ensure the consistency of the gating strategy between batches. A tonsil sample is preferred for this purpose, as it contains the cell populations of interest. However, PBMC could also be used if human tonsils are not available, keeping in mind that certain markers (e.g., BCL6) are not be expressed, or expressed at low levels in cell populations from blood.\nAfter obtaining the FNA sample, spin at 300 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant by aspiration, leaving 100–200 μL of residual volume. If red blood cells appear abundant in the pellet, proceed to step 10. Otherwise, proceed to step 13.\nTo lyse red blood cells, resuspend cells in 2 mL of ACK Lysis Buffer and incubate on ice (or at 4°C) for 3–5 min.\nNote: Longer incubation times in ACK Lysis Buffer can decrease cell viability. We tend to keep this step as short as possible by ending the incubation as soon as the solution clears (becomes transparent).\nStop the lysis reaction by adding 20 mL of ice-cold PBS and spin cells at 300 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant by aspiration.\nResuspend cell pellet in 500 μL of Culture Media. Count cells on a hemocytometer. Cells should be kept at 4°C (or on ice) throughout processing, unless otherwise denoted.\nPrepare staining mixes. It is recommended to prepare a two-sample excess of these mixes.",
    "Note: The concentrations listed below are 2× concentrations, as Stain Mix 1 and Stain Mix 2 are ultimately combined 1:1 (see step 19).\nStain Mix 1: Prepare by mixing the appropriate volume of each antibody in FACS Buffer as described in the table below. 50 μL of mix is required per sample.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2203_6.csv\nStain Mix 2:\nFirst prepare the eBioscienceTM Fixable Viability Dye eFluorTM 780 by diluting it 1:1,000 in FACS Buffer (for a final dilution of 1:4,000).\nThen combine diluted viability dye 1:1 with Brilliant Stain Buffer to achieve a total volume of 50 μL of mix per sample (mix 25 μL of diluted viability dye with 25 μL of Brilliant Stain Buffer per sample).\nAdd the appropriate volume of each antibody/tetramer as described in the table below to obtain a 2× dilution.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2203_7.csv\nAdd the appropriate number/volume of cells to a V-bottom 96-well plate. 0.5–1 × 106 cells per staining are recommended, but lower numbers can be stained according to the FNA yield.\nNote: If larger numbers of cells have been collected, they can be cryopreserved as described in the FNA cryopreservation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3] section.\nSpin cells at 400 × g for 2 min at 4°C.\nAspirate supernatant and resuspend cells in 50 μL of Stain Mix 1.\nIncubate plate for 10 min at 37°C.\nCritical: Chemokine staining with Stain Mix 1 must be performed at 37°C. Staining for chemokine receptors at 4°C yields poor separation of positive and negative signals, while staining at 37°C markedly improves separation.\nAfter incubation, add 50 μL of Stain Mix 2 directly to each well (without washing) and gently resuspend by pipetting.\nIncubate for 1 h at 4°C. During this incubation, prepare the solutions for the fixation/permeabilization step (see step 22a).",
    "After the incubation is complete, add 100 μL of ice-cold FACS Buffer to each sample and spin cells at 400 × g for 2 min at 4°C.\nFix and permeabilize the cells using the FoxP3 / Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set:\nDuring the incubation in step 20, prepare 200 μL per sample of the Fixation/Permeabilization Solution by diluting the 4× Fixation/Permeabilization Concentrate in the Fixation/Permeabilization Diluent (for 200 μL total: mix 50 μL Concentrate with 150 μL Diluent).\nAspirate supernatant and resuspend in 200 μL of Fixation/Permeabilization Solution per well.\nIncubate for 1 h at 4°C. During this time, complete steps 23 and 24.\nPrepare a 1× Permeabilization Buffer by diluting the Permeabilization Buffer (10×) in milliQ water (for 1 mL total: mix 100 μL of 10× Buffer in 900 μL of water).\nPrepare 100 μL of BCL6 staining mix per sample by diluting the BCL6 antibody 1:50 in 1× Permeabilization Buffer.\nAfter incubation is complete, spin cells at 400 × g for 2 min at 4°C. Then, aspirate supernatant and resuspend samples in 100 μL of BCL6 staining mix.\nIncubate for 1 h at 4°C.\nAfter incubation, add 100 μL of 1× Permeabilization Buffer to each sample and spin cells at 400 × g for 2 min at 4°C.\nAspirate supernatant and resuspend in 200 μL of FACS Buffer and proceed to flow cytometry sample acquisition.\nCritical: To ensure an adequate number of events for analysis, the entire sample volume should be acquired on the flow cytometer.\nNote: Because of the intracellular BCL6 staining, samples are best acquired as soon as possible on the flow cytometer. In extreme circumstances they can be left up to 16 h before acquiring, but this will decrease the intensity of BCL6 signal.\nFNA cryopreservation\nTiming: 24 h (for steps 29–31)",
    "If enough cells are recovered from the FNA procedure, excess sample can be cryopreserved for future use. In this section, we describe how to cryopreserve these samples for long term storage.\nIf freezing cells, after spinning at 300 × g for 10 min at 4°C, gently resuspend the desired number of cells in the appropriate volume (2–10 × 106 cells/mL) of Freezing Media and rapidly transfer to a cryogenic vial.\nImmediately transfer vials to a pre-chilled isopropanol freezing container, such as a Nalgene® Mr.Frosty, and place in a −80°C freezer.\nThe following day (approximately 24 h following step 30), transfer the vials into cryoboxes and place in vapor phase liquid nitrogen (below −135°C) for long-term storage.\nNote: Performing the flow analysis on frozen samples, instead of fresh, is possible if enough cells are recovered from the FNA procedure to allow for cryopreservation. FNA cell recovery will depend on the time point of collection post-vaccination and on whether the subjects undergoing the FNA collection are immunocompetent or immunocompromised. In our published study,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] we opted to perform spectral flow cytometry analysis of fresh FNA samples because of the variability in cell yield at certain time points for immunocompromised individuals. It is also worth mentioning that while the concurrent analysis of multiple cryopreserved samples might reduce variability introduced by performing the staining on different days and/or the cytometer set up, cryopreservation itself can affect the quality of detection for certain markers. For instance, the signal intensity of some chemokine receptors might be reduced after cryopreservation."
