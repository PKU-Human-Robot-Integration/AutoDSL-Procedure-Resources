    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis mitochondrial isolation protocol uses the Agilent Seahorse XF96 Analyzer to analyze respiratory function. Note that oxygen consumption can be analyzed in these isolated mitochondrial fractions using other equipment as well. The primary adjustment that might be required when using other equipment is to increase the amount of mitochondrial mass loaded per measurement.\nSample collection\nTiming: 30 min\nThe first section of this protocol describes the dissection and preparation of murine brown adipose tissue, prior to its mechanical lysis to liberate mitochondria and lipid droplets. We are currently adapting this protocol to other mouse and human tissues, which will be described in a separate publication.\nNote: The number of mice needed for effective isolation of PDMs varies according to tissue lipid content. A sufficient amount of lipids is required to effectively form a buoyant fat layer on the surface of the homogenate (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Fewer animals can be used if mice have higher lipid content due to age, diet, or genetic manipulation. This protocol has been optimized for BAT isolation from 6 mice, with dissected BAT weights per mouse varying between 80–300 mg. Thus, a minimum of 480 mg of tissue is needed.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/346-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Separation of the fat layer containing PDMs by low-speed centrifugation\n(A) Image of 50 mL Falcon tube containing BAT homogenate after first low-speed centrifugation (step 3). Note the separation of fraction 1, containing the fat layer and peridroplet mitochondria (PDMs), from fraction 2, containing cytosolic mitochondria (CMs).\n(B and C) (B) Fraction 1 in the decanted original Falcon tube after pouring (C) the supernatant containing CMs, namely fraction 2, into a clean tube.\nCritical: The buoyancy of lipid droplets is the process that separates peridroplet mitochondria (PDMs) from the other mitochondria.",
    "Euthanize mice one-by-one using isoflurane and secondary cervical dislocation as approved by your institutional animal care and use committee in compliance with US Public Health Service Regulation. Cervical dislocation should be performed carefully to avoid tearing interscapular brown adipose tissue at the base of the neck.\nCritical: Isoflurane must be handled in a fume hood, as it is a volatile anesthetic.\nExsanguinate mice by cardiac puncture using a syringe with a 23G needle to minimize blood within the isolated BAT.\nDissect interscapular BAT from 6 male 12-week-old C57BL/6J mice and immediately place in 6-well plate or petri dish containing ice-cold PBS.\nUse surgical scissors and forceps to separate BAT from connective tissue, muscle, and white adipose tissue, preferably using a dissection microscope.\nWeigh pooled BAT tissue from 6 mice (480 mg minimum) and mince it into ∼2mm pieces with scissors or razors.\nRe-suspend tissue pieces in 10:1 (volume: weight) in ice-cold MIB + BSA.\nTissue and cell mechanical lysis\nTiming: 10 min\nCritical: All tubes and materials must be ice-cold and remain ice-cold throughout the protocol.\nDisrupt tissue with 9–10 strokes in ice-cold glass/Teflon Dounce homogenizer until the MIB and tissue appear as a homogenous solution, with the Dounce head moving smoothly through the solution.\nCritical: Do not use detergents or soaps to clean the homogenizer, as they can disrupt mitochondrial membranes. Use warm water and clean brushes. For samples with higher content of connective tissue, a glass-glass loose Dounce homogenizer is recommended. As glass can break during homogenization, one should be mindful of sharps hazards.\nSeparating fat cake by low-speed centrifugation\nTiming: 20 min\nPeridroplet mitochondria (PDMs) are separated from cytosolic mitochondria (CMs) during the low-speed centrifugation step, which also separates nuclei, insoluble cell debris and unbroken tissue (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).",
    "Transfer homogenate into ice-cold 50mL Falcon tube (Corning) and centrifuge 900 × g (low speed) for 10 min at 4°C, using a centrifuge with swinging bucket rotor.\nCritical: When using a swinging bucket rotor, measure the distance between the center of the rotor and the center of the liquid homogenate mass within the tube, when in horizontal position, in order to transform 900 × g into the actual rpm needed.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/346-Si1.jpg\nCarefully pour the supernatant, which is fraction 2 that contains CMs, into a new ice-cold falcon tube (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). A cell strainer (70–100 μm) can be used to prevent debris or loose fat to mix with the CM fraction. Pouring will leave the fat layer on the side of the tube, which is fraction 1 that contains PDMs, and the pellet in the original tube (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nBy keeping the tube horizontally, scrape fraction 1 into a second and clean ice-cold 50 mL tube and re-suspend in 4 mL of MIB + BSA buffer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nAlternatives: Use a P1000 micropipette with 1/3 of its tip cut, collect fraction 1, and transfer it to a clean tube. Cutting 1/3 of the tip increases its bore size, which prevents tip clogging when aspirating the fat layer. Collecting fat layer by pipetting is not the preferred option, as fat can remain attached to the tip and thus lost. Consequently, this alternative should only be used if the fat layer does not remain intact and adherent to the side of the tube, after pouring fraction 2 to a clean tube. See Troubleshooting, problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nCritical: It is critical that sufficient tissue is homogenized to generate a compact and floating fat layer on the surface of the homogenate. See Troubleshooting, problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] if a floating layer is absent.",
    "Critical: Save 1 μL of fraction 1 for peridroplet mitochondria imaging, as a quality control assessment.\nDiscard the original 50 mL tube that contains the pelleted unbroken cells, nuclei, and debris.\nRepeat the low-speed centrifugation on fraction 1 re-suspended in 4 mL of MIB + BSA and on fraction 2 in the new tube, to further eliminate debris.\nCritical: Fractions 1 and 2 must be completely cleared of debris prior to high-speed centrifugation steps. If necessary, perform a third low-speed centrifugation. If a residual lipid layer is generated after a second slow spin of fraction 2, discard it and do not pool it with clean fraction 1.\nIsolating CMs and PDMs by high-speed centrifugation\nTiming: 1 h 30 min\nBy using high-speed centrifugation, PDMs will be separated from fraction 1 and cytosolic mitochondria (CMs) from fraction 2.\nTransfer clean fraction 1 and fraction 2 to 2mL Eppendorf tubes and centrifuge at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C using a microfuge (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/346-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Mitochondrial isolation by high-speed centrifugation\n(A) Re-suspended fraction 1 in MIB + BSA and fraction 2 before high-speed centrifugation.\n(B) Top and side views of the mitochondrial pellets generated from high-speed centrifugation of fraction 1 and fraction 2. Note that fraction 2 after high-speed centrifugation should have minimal fat layer compared to fraction 1.\nDiscard the lipid layer and supernatants generated after centrifuging Fractions 1 and 2.\nUse a P1000 pipette to physically scrape the lipid layer and gently evacuate residual lipids before removing supernatant. This step is to prevent the lipids from mixing with the PDM pellet.\nCritical: Save at least 1 μL of the discarded lipid layer for quality control measurements.\nThe pellet obtained from fraction 1 will contain PDMs and the pellet from fraction 2 will contain CMs (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).",
    "Re-suspend pellets in 200 μL MIB + BSA and transfer them to clean 1.5 mL tubes.\nCritical: There should be minimal lipid content floating after high-speed centrifugation of fraction 2. The presence of large amounts of lipid in fraction 2 can indicate a contamination of CMs with PDMs. Refer to “Separating Fat Cake by Low-Speed Centrifugation” steps to optimize slow centrifugation steps and minimize lipid content in fraction 2.\nRepeat high-speed centrifugation step to wash residual lipids and non-mitochondrial contents with MIB + BSA.\nFollowing the second high-speed centrifugation, remove supernatant and preserve washed pellets with mitochondria.\nCritical: There should be no visible lipid layer at this step. Perform additional centrifugation steps until no lipid layer is observed.\nGently re-suspend mitochondrial pellets by pipetting up and down (do not use vortex) in ice-cold MIB without BSA and determine protein concentration by BCA assay (Thermo). When re-suspending pellet in MIB, aim for a concentration of ∼10 μg/μL (1:2–1:3 volume pellet: buffer). These ratios result in re-suspending fraction 1 in 20–40 μL and fraction 2 in 40–60 μL of buffer.\nCritical: Use MIB without BSA for protein determination, as BSA will cause an overestimation of protein content in the mitochondrial fractions. See Troubleshooting, problems 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.2].\nPause Point: Isolated CMs and PDMs can be pelleted and stored long-term at −80°C. Frozen and thawed mitochondria can be used to measure maximal respiratory capacity, with the exception of mitochondrial coupled respiration (Acin-Perez et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Osto et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). It is recommended to determine the protein concentration before use.\nFunctional assessment of PDMs and CMs by respirometry\nTiming: 1 h",
    "Here we describe how to measure oxidative function of PDMs and CMs under different fuels, using the Seahorse XF96 analyzer from Agilent Technologies. This equipment allows the use of minimal amounts of biological sample, namely 2–4 μg of protein per measurement. Respiration can be measured in these same fractions using other equipment measuring oxygen consumption, but the amount of mitochondria loaded will likely need to be increased. Consult “Before You Begin” section to prepare the equipment and XF96 cartridge before starting the assay.\nLoad the cartridge with 15 μL MAS + ADP in port A, 16.6 μL MAS + oligomycin in port B, 18.5 μL MAS + FCCP in port C, and 20.5 μL MAS + antimycin A in Port D (see Tables with Solution composition in Materials and Methods section).\nAlternatives: As basal respiration with substrates in the absence of ADP is functionally equivalent to respiration under oligomycin, one can plate mitochondria already with ADP, then add 15 μL MAS + oligomycin in port A, 16.6 μL MAS + FCCP in port B, 18.5 μL MAS + antimycin A in port C and 20.5 μL MAS + TMPD/Ascorbate in Port D to determine maximal complex IV activity. This alternative is critical for models with less healthy or less resilient mitochondria. Starting at state 3 reduces the time of the assay itself and of mitochondria being hyperpolarized. The reason is that hyperpolarized, highly respiring mitochondria are not as stable at 37°C. See Troubleshooting, problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nLoad the protocol prepared the day before the assay, press start, and place the utility plate containing the hydrated sensor cartridge, with its ports loaded, into the XF96 analyzer to begin oxygen and pH sensor calibration. Calibration takes 30 min, during which one can load mitochondria into the XF96 cell culture microplate.",
    "For each mitochondrial fuel, generate a master mix with sufficient volume for at least triplicate measures (3 wells), with up to three different fuels assessed per sample. Each well will contain 2–4 μg mitochondria in 20 μL MAS + the substrate to be assessed (pyruvate + malate, succinate + rotenone or palmitoyl-carnitine + malate). Thus, each master mix will contain at least a total of 60 μL with 6–12 μg of mitochondria per substrate to cover triplicates.\nLoad 20 μL of each master mix into individual wells of the microplate using a P20 pipette. Mitochondria show higher respiratory rates under succinate + rotenone. Thus, 2 μg of mitochondria should be loaded under succinate + rotenone and 4 μg for the other substrates.\nCentrifuge the plate at 2,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C using a swinging bucket rotor with plate carriers and running with the rotor brakes off, to sediment mitochondria at the bottom surface of the well.\nCritical: Load mitochondria in the center of the well. If mitochondria attach to the wall of the well, oxygen consumption will not be properly measured. Turn OFF centrifuge brake and allow the rotor to reduce speed gradually, so that the plate is not shook by a sudden decrease in speed and mitochondria can stay at the center of the well.",
    "Add 115 μL MAS + GDP + substrate using multichannel pipette at a 45° angle to the top of each chamber well. Total volume in the well is going to be 135 μL. The total volume needs to be accurate, as 10× solutions for ADP (15 + 135 = 150 μL), oligomycin (16.6 + 150 = 166.6 μL), FCCP (18.5 + 166.6 = 185.1 μL), and antimycin A (20.5 + 185.1 = 205.6 μL) will be injected from the ports on top.\nCritical: The additional 115 μL of MAS should be added gradually, to prevent detaching mitochondria from the bottom of the well. Mitochondria can be visualized by bright field or fluorescent microscopy, using a 40×–63× objective. A homogenous layer of bacteria-like structures (mitochondria) should be observed on the surface of the well (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nWarm the Seahorse plate with mitochondria in a 37°C incubator for 5 min before loading the plate into the XF96 Analyzer.\nReplace the utility plate with the Seahorse plate loaded with mitochondria and start the assay. Assay duration is around 1 h.\nData analysis\nTiming: 1 h\nExport Point-to-point oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) of individual wells from Seahorse instrument (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/346-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Respirometry assay of isolated PDMs versus CMs from brown adipose tissue\nRepresentative trace of oxygen consumption rates (OCR) of isolated PDMs and CMs fueled by pyruvate + malate. ADP, oligomycin, FCCP, and antimycin A were sequentially injected to assess mitochondrial respiratory states. The injection of ADP in port A increases, oligomycin decreases, and FCCP increases respiration only when mitochondria are intact after isolation. Antimycin A blocks respiration, leaving some oxygen consumption attributed to other mitochondrial processes (i.e., ROS generation). 4–6 technical replicates per group. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Adapted from Benador et al. (2018)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2].",
    "Check that the oxygen tension traces are linear in each measurement, as a quality control parameter. Non-linear traces do not allow a reliable calculation of OCR.\nUsing Microsoft Excel, perform the following calculations described with the OCR values measured in each individual well. For each calculation, the OCR under Antimycin A is subtracted from other values to obtain the OCR that corresponds to mitochondrial respiratory function. This is because Antimycin-resistant oxygen consumption cannot arise from mitochondrial respiration, since Antimycin A blocks electron transfer from complex III to complex IV, with complex IV being responsible for respiration (reducing oxygen to water).\nState 2: Subtract minimal OCR value following antimycin A injection from maximal OCR value at the start of the assay. State 2 represents respiration of mitochondria with fuels, without ATP synthesis, as ADP should be absent.\nState 3: Subtract minimal OCR value following antimycin A injection from maximal OCR value following ADP injection. See Troubleshooting, problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3] if poor response to ADP is observed.\nState 4o: Subtract minimal OCR value following antimycin A injection from minimal OCR value following oligomycin injection (mitochondria with fuels, with ATP synthase blocked, functionally equivalent to state 2).\nMaximal: Subtract minimal OCR value following antimycin A injection from maximal OCR value following FCCP injection. See Troubleshooting, problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.4] if OCR is unstable.\nQuality control\nTiming: variable",
    "To assess the quality of isolated mitochondria, Option A describes a quantitative parameter to assess integrity of mitochondrial function after isolation. Option B describes a microscopic assessment of the lipid droplets with mitochondria still attached by fluorescence microscopy and the presence of lipid droplets in the PDM fraction. Option C describes measuring the relative mitochondrial protein content in each fraction by biochemical techniques, to determine correspondence of protein loaded to the respirometry assay with mitochondria loaded. Option D describes assessing mitochondrial function by membrane potential analysis.\nOption A: The respiratory control ratio (RCR) is the ratio between state 3/state 2 or state 3/state 4o respiration and can be used as a quantitative measure of mitochondrial inner membrane damage. Physical damage to the mitochondrial inner membrane is indicated by RCR values < 4, when respiring under pyruvate + malate, or < 2, when respiring with succinate + rotenone or palmitoyl-carnitine + malate. A similar or greater fold increase in OCR should be seen after injecting FCCP.\nOption B: Measurement of mitochondria and lipid droplet (LD) content by fluorescence microscopy.\nCombine 1 μL of non-stripped fat layer (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A), 1 μL stripped fat layer and 1 μL isolated PDMs (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B) with 1 μL Imaging solution A.\nPlace 1 μL of each sample- Imaging solution A mix on a #1.5H coverglass and cover with an additional coverglass.\nPlace the coverglass on a confocal microscope stage and image BODIPY using 488 nm laser for excitation and collect fluorescence emission at 500–550 nm. Using a separate track, image MitoTracker with 633 nm excitation and collect emission at 650–700 nm. Use 20× lens for low-magnification imaging of LD content (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]) (Benador et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/346-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Note the localization of mitochondria to lipid droplet surface.\n(B) Image of re-suspended PDM pellet stained with mitochondrial marker MitoTracker red. Isolated PDMs have little to no lipid droplets.\n(C) Images of re-suspended fraction 1 after high-speed centrifugation, stained with the lipid droplet dye BODIPY (green) and the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker red.

Scale bars, 5μm. Adapted from Benador et al. (2018)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2].\nThe non-stripped fat layer should have mitochondria closely attached to lipid droplets (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A) and the isolated PDM fraction should not have lipid droplets (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). The stripped fat layer should have little to no mitochondria (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nOption C: Quantification of total mitochondrial content in each fraction by western Blot.\nCombine 1–10 μg isolated mitochondria and boil at 95 °C for 5 min.\nRun and transfer an SDS gel as specified by gel apparatus manufacturer.\nProbe for the relative content of mitochondrial markers, such as TOMM20 or VDAC and quantify per microgram of protein loaded.\nCritical: The semi-quantitative data obtained from Option B can provide evidence that functional differences detected between samples of different types do not arise from differential enrichment of PDMs in the isolated fraction. Option C is an essential step when comparing PDMs from different tissues or mice with different ages or genetic manipulations.\nAlternatives: Evaluate mitochondrial content by mass spectroscopy proteomic analysis using MitoCarta 2.0 to estimate mitochondrial protein content.\nOption D: Assessment of mitochondrial function by membrane potential imaging.",
    "Combine 1 μL of isolated mitochondria with 1μL Imaging solution B.\nPlace 1 μL of mitochondria-solution B mix on a #1.5H coverglass and cover with an additional coverglass.\nPlace the coverglass on microscope stage and image MitoTracker green using 488 nm laser excitation and 500–550 nm emission. Using a separate track, image MitoTracker red with 633 nm excitation and 650–700 nm emission (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D and 5E).\nNote: MitoTracker red staining is more sensitive to differences in membrane potential, while MitoTracker green is less sensitive. Therefore, mitochondria with intact membrane potential will stain with both green and red (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D and 5E), while depolarized mitochondria will only stain green (Benador et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2])."
