    "1. Preparation of standard 3NT, Kyn, 3HKyn, 3HAA, XA standard stock solutions\nWeigh the reagents in a vial with the highest accuracy (0.3 mg each). For better accuracy, scale up the reagents, adjusting the volume of the solvent according to step 1.2.\nDissolve the reagents in 300 µL of the solvent to obtain a stock solution of 1 g/L. Dissolve 3NT in 1% (v/v) formic acid (FA) in water; Kyn, 3HAA, and XA in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); 3HKyn in water acidified to pH 2.5 with hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n\tCAUTION: 3HAA irritates eyes, nose, throat and lungs. It is harmful when inhaled, in contact with skin, and if swallowed. Wear appropriate protection i.e., gloves and mask.\nTightly close the vial and place it in an ultrasonic bath for 1 min to accelerate dissolution.\n\tNOTE: Store the stock solutions at -20 °C and minimize freezing/thawing (3 cycles max) due to the instability of the stock solutions.\n2. Preparation of charcoal treated culture medium\nIn a tube, weigh 280 mg of activated charcoal and add 5 mL of the liquid medium prepared for culturing the cells of interest.\nShake the tube with the medium and charcoal on a see saw rocker for 2 h, at room temperature (set speed to 50 oscillations/min). Next, centrifuge the tubes at 6000 x g for 15 min.\nRemove the tube from the centrifuge and carefully collect the supernatant without disturbing the sediment. Repeat centrifugation if necessary, to remove all charcoal residues.\nFilter the supernatant using a 0.45 µm syringe filter.\nEnsure that the charcoal pretreated culture medium is deprived of kynurenines traces by running a pilot sample on LC-MS as described in step 6.3.2. Otherwise, repeat steps 2.1-2.4.",
    "NOTE: If the complete culture medium initially does not contain kynurenines, purification step using charcoal might be omitted. In this case, prepare calibration standards and quality control samples using the complete medium usually prepared for cell culturing.\nStore the prepared medium at 4 °C until analysis.\n3. Making the calibration solutions and calibration curves\nSpike the charcoal pretreated culture medium with 0.75 µL of 0.1 g/L 3NT solution and add four standards (3HKyn, 3HAA, Kyn, XA) at least at six different concentrations to cover calibration ranges. Keep the final volume of each sample at 150 µL. Vortex well. Use 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes for sample preparation.\n\tNOTE: Suggested calibration points for 3HKyn: 0.018, 0.045, 0.22, 1.12, 2.23, 4.46 µmol/L; for Kyn: 0.0096, 0.048, 0.24, 1.20, 2.40, 3.84 µmol/L; for 3HAA: 0.033, 0.16, 0.65, 3.27, 6.53, 13.06 µmol/L; for XA: 0.019, 0.13, 0.49, 1.22, 3.65, 4.87 µmol/L.\nAdd 150 µL of cold methanol (kept at -20 °C) containing 1% (v/v) formic acid into each tube for sample deproteinization. Tightly close the tubes and vortex well.\nIncubate the samples at -20 °C for 40 min.\nCentrifuge the samples at 14,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. Remove the tubes from the centrifuge. Collect supernatants into the new tubes. Do not disturb the sediment.\nTransfer 270 µL of the supernatant into the glass vial using an automatic pipette. Put the vials into the evaporator and gently evaporate until dry. Use the appropriate program for water/methanol fractions to evaporate volatile components. Do not apply temperature higher than 40 °C and avoid over-drying.\n\tNOTE: Flat bottom glass vials, i.e., chromatographic vials facilitate faster evaporation and higher recoveries in comparison to plastic conical tubes.\nAfter 30 min, check the evaporation status. If necessary, continue evaporation (e.g., add extra 10 min). Avoid over-drying.",
    "Remove the vials from the evaporator. Reconstitute each sample in 60 µL of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water. Add the solvent into the vial containing the residual material. Tightly close the vials and vortex-well.\nTransfer the sample into a 1.5 mL tube and spin at 14,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C to separate the precipitated protein.\nWithout disturbing the protein pellet, transfer the supernatants into chromatographic vials with conical glass inserts with an automatic pipette. Tightly close the vials.\nCheck for the presence of air bubbles in the insert vial and remove them if necessary (e.g., by vortexing).\nTransfer the chromatographic vials containing samples into LC autosampler. Record the position of samples placed in an autosampler tray.\n4. Preparation of quality control (QC) samples\nSpike the charcoal-pretreated culture medium (prepared in a 1.5 ml centrifugal tube) with 0.75 µL of 0.1 g/L 3NT solution and standards of four kynurenines (3HKyn, 3HAA, Kyn, XA) at one concentration selected from the linear range of the calibration curves. Keep the final volume of the sample at 150 µL.\n\tNOTE: If applicable, prepare several QC samples at different concentrations falling under the linear range of the calibration curve.\nFollow the protocol described in section 3 (steps 3.2-3.11).\n5. Setting up the LC-MS system\nPrepare the mobile phase solvents: Solvent A: 20 mmol/L ammonium formate in ultrapure water (pH 4.3 adjusted with formic acid); Solvent B: 100% acetonitrile.\n\tNOTE: Use borosilicate glass bottles only. Rinse bottles with ultrapure water before refilling it. Do not use bottles cleaned with detergents.\n\tCAUTION: Acetonitrile causes severe health effects or death. It is easily ignited by heat. Acetonitrile liquid and vapor can irritate eyes, nose, throat and lungs.",
    "Prepare 5 mol/L stock solution of ammonium formate by dissolving a crystalline reagent (15.77 g) in 50 mL of ultrapure water in a glass bottle. Stir until all residuals dissolve. Filter through the 0.45 µm membrane to remove any residual debris (e.g., by using a nylon syringe filter). Store the stock solution at 4 °C.\nPrepare Solvent A by adding 4 mL of 5 mol/L ammonium formate in water to 980 mL of ultrapure water in an amber glass bottle and stir well. Immerse a stirring bar and put the bottle with the solvent on a magnetic stirrer. Immerse a pH electrode into the solution and control the pH under stirring. Add formic acid stock solution (98%-100%) dropwise using an automatic pipette with 0.2 mL tip to obtain pH 4.3, adjust the volume up to 1 L with ultrapure water and stir well.\n\t\tNOTE: Prepare the solvents at least once a week to prevent any microbial growth.\n\t\tCAUTION: Formic acid (FA) is toxic when inhaled, causes skin burns and eye damage. Work under the fume hood; wear protective gloves and coat.\nFilter all solutions through the 0.22 µm membrane (e.g., nylon syringe filter) to remove any residual debris. Optionally, use the solvent inlet filters dedicated for LC solvent reservoirs to protect the system from incoming particles.\nStart LC-MS control and data acquisition software.\nPurge the LC system with the mobile phase to remove bubbles, and to prime all solvent channels.\nEnsemble a guard column to protect the analytical column from clogging.\nFlush the guard and analytical column (C18, 2.1 x 100 mm, 1.8 µm) with 100% acetonitrile for about 30 min, and then with 100% solvent A until a stable pressure in the column is observed. Control the system performance using the control software.",
    "Set the appropriate LC parameters in the data acquisition software.\n\t\nSet up the gradient program: 0-8 min solvent B 0%; 8-17 min solvent B 0-2%; 17-20 min solvent B 2%; 20-32 min solvent B 10-30%; 32-45 min solvent B 0%.\nSet the mobile phase flow rate at 0.15 mL/min, total analysis run time for 45 min, column temperature at +40 °C and injection volume at 10 µL.\nSet the acquisition parameters of the mass spectrometry detector.\n\t\nApply ionization parameters: single ion monitoring (SIM), positive ionization, nebulizer pressure of 50 psi, +350 °C drying gas temperature, drying gas flow of 12 L/min, and 5500 V capillary voltage.\nSelect the analyte monitoring ions: for 3HKyn m/z 225.0 (scan period: 2-6 min, fragmentor voltage: 100 V); for Kyn m/z 209.0 (scan period: 6-12 min, fragmentor voltage: 80 V); for 3HAA m/z 154.0 (scan period: 12-18 min, fragmentor voltage: 80 V); for 3NT m/z 227.0 (scan period: 18-23 min, fragmentor voltage: 100 V); for XA m/z 206.0 (scan period: 23-45 min, fragmentor voltage: 100 V).\nConstruct a worklist and run samples on the LC system.\nAt first, before the analysis of the experimental samples, run a blank sample (Solvent A) at least in triplicates, followed by one QC sample.\nOpen the data analysis software and load the results obtained for the QC sample.\nCheck the position of analyte peaks on the chromatogram. When signals shift beyond the expected position adjust the time gates for appropriate analyte signals collection. See the software manual for instruction on signal integration.\n6. Constructing the calibration curve\nIn the data acquisition software, add calibration standards into the worklist and run the standards in triplicates.",
    "Integrate and measure the peak area corresponding to 3HKyn, Kyn, 3HAA, 3NT, and XA at the retention time of about 4.4 min, 10 min, 16 min, 21 min, and 30 min, respectively.\nConstruct individual calibration curves for each metabolite using a spreadsheet program.\n\t\nTo create the calibration chart, plot the value for a ratio of analyte peak area over the 3NT peak area versus the concentration of the analyte.\nAnalyze the blank sample (charcoal-pretreated culture medium spiked only with 3NT) to ensure there is no trace of the studied analytes in the medium. Otherwise, subtract the obtained value from each calibration point.\nCheck the linearity of each calibration curve.\n\t\t\nIndividually, for each analyte, create a slope-intercept linear equation (y = ax +b), where y corresponds to the ratio of the analyte peak area versus 3NT peak area, a is the slope, x is the analyte concentration (µmol/L), and b refers to the curve intercept. Plotting the graph ‘y’ versus ‘x’ will generate the calibration curve.\nAdd a linear trendline to the chart, display the calibration curve equation and regression coefficient on the chart. Ensure that the regression coefficient is > 0.990. In case of mismatched calibration standards, prepare and/or analyze these once again. Optionally, change the concentration range of the calibration curve.\nAnalyze the QC samples to check the system performance before analyzing the experimental samples. In case of incompatibilities (± 20% deviation from the reference value), prepare the new calibration curves.\n7. In vitro cell culture and sample collection for analysis",
    "Plate the studied cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 or SK-OV-3) in DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium) containing 4.5 g/L of ᴅ-glucose, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mmol/L ʟ-glutamine and 1 U penicillin/streptomycin and culture at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 to expand them for the experiment. Passage the cells at 80% of confluency.\nDetach cells from the culture dish using trypsin, seed for the experiment on 12-well plates at a density of 0.3 × 106 cells per well and place in an incubator overnight.\nThe next day, aspirate the culture medium and add fresh DMEM with or without the addition of the studied compounds, depending on the experimental design.\nAfter 48 h, collect the medium from above the cells (about 500 µL) into a 1.5 mL tube. Centrifuge at 14, 000 x g for 5 min to remove any cell debris. Collect the supernatant and store at -80 °C until the analysis.\nSave the cellular pellet from step 7.4 for protein estimation. Freeze the samples at -20 °C.\n\tNOTE: The results obtained for a medium from different wells should be normalized to total protein content to account for the variability in cell number in individual wells. Protein concentration can be assessed as described in step 9.\n8. Prepare samples for LC-MS analysis\nThaw the frozen sample at room temperature and mix well. Transfer 149.25 µL of the culture medium into a centrifugation tube (1.5 mL).\nAdd 0.75 µL of 0.1 g/L of 3NT solution (internal standard).

Close the tubes and vortex well.\nContinue with sample preparation as described in section 3 (steps 3.3-3.11).",
    "NOTE: Some cancer cells like SK-OV-3 secrete large amounts of Kyn into a culture medium. To fit the data into a linear range of the calibration curve, approximately 100-fold dilution of the sample is necessary. In this case, dilute a portion of the sample with 0.1% (v/v) FA in water and analyze in addition to the undiluted sample. The reference samples of standards for the calibration curve should be prepared in 100 times diluted complete culture medium. Alternatively, add more points in the calibration curve (if proper solubility and linearity are achieved) to adjust it to the concentration level of Kyn in the experimental sample.\nAnalyze the samples by LC-MS as described in section 5. Construct a worklist and run each sample in triplicate.\nAfter the worklist is completed, measure the peak area of analyte.\nGenerate a spreadsheet using the available software and the obtain numerical data.\nIn one spreadsheet column calculate the ratio of the analyte peak area over the 3NT peak area.\nUse an individual linear calibration equation dedicated for each analyte (from step 6.3.) to calculate concentrations of analytes present in the experimental samples.\n9. Assessing protein content and data normalization\nResuspend the cellular pellet from step 7.5 with 100 µL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in 1.5 mL tube.\n\tNOTE: Prepare PBS solution by dissolving 8 g of sodium chloride, 0.2 g of potassium chloride, 1.44 g of sodium phosphate dibasic, potassium dihydrogen phosphate in 950 mL of ultrapure water. Stir well. Adjust the pH to 7.4 with hydrochloric acid (dropwise). Adjust volume up to 1 L with ultrapure water. Stir well until homogeneous.",
    "CAUTION: Hydrochloric acid is highly corrosive and must be handled with suitable safety precautions. Contact with human skin can cause redness, pain, skin burns. Work under the fume hood; wear protective gloves and coat.\nFreeze the samples at  -20 °C and then defrost on ice. Repeat this step 3x.\nCentrifuge the samples at 14, 000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. Collect the supernatants into the new tubes. Do not disturb the pellet.\nDilute the supernatants 10x with PBS.\nConstruct a calibration curve from 0 to 2 µg of the protein per well range.\n\t\nPrepare bovine serum albumin (BSA) standard solution for the calibration. Dissolve 1.23 µg of BSA in 1 mL of ultrapure water and vortex well.\nOn a 96-well plate, load different amounts of BSA standard solution (1.23 µg/mL): 0 µL, 2 µL, 4 µL, 5 µL, 7 µL, 10 µL, 15 µL, 20 µL.\nFill the well with PBS to the final volume of 50 µL.\nLoad 10 - 15 µL cell lysate from step 9.4 on the same 96-well plate. Fill the wells with PBS to reach to the final volume of 50 µL.\n\tNOTE: If needed, adjust the volume of the cell lysate aliquot in each well to fit in the linear range of the calibration curve. Keep the final volume to 50 µL of the sample per well.\nAdd 200 µL of a Bradford reagent (diluted 5-times with ultrapure water) to each well.\nIncubate the 96-well pate for at least 5 min at room temperature. Insert the plate into a microplate reader. Measure absorbance at λ = 595 nm.\nConstruct a calibration curve using a spreadsheet program. Plot the BSA amount (µg) versus absorbance. Add a linear trendline, display the calibration curve equation and regression coefficient on the chart.",
    "Use the linear equation (y = ax +b, where y corresponds to the absorbance at λ = 595 nm, a is the slope, x is a protein content (µg), and b refers to the curve intercept) to calculate protein amount in the sample.\n\tNOTE: Consider a sample dilution factor in calculations.\nUse the estimated protein content to normalize kynurenine amount in the sample per 1 mg of protein. To do this, divide the concentration of kynurenines determined in step 8.9 with the total protein content from step 9.10.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
