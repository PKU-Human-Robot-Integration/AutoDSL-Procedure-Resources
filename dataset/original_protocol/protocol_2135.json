    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nCell Isolation\nTiming: 3 h\nAdult murine cardiac ventricular tissue is dissociated to isolate single interstitial cells (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/172-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Workflow\nGraphic summary of the main steps to obtain live nucleated single interstitial cells from adult murine hearts.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/172-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Images of Critical Steps\n(A) Images of the set up before the experiment, which include preparing the buffers and turning on the AutoMACS; preparing the ice buckets, the collection tubes, the dissection stage; refrigerating the centrifuges at 4°C and warming up the water bath at 37°C.\n(B) Images showing the dissection of the ventricles, enzymatic digestion in Erlenmeyer flask on a magnetic stirrer and collection of the cell suspension in a collection tube (CT) on ice.\n(C) Images of the Red blood cell (RBC) lysis step and the pellet suspension in dead cell removal beads.\nNote: This protocol is adapted from a previous protocol (Chong et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nAfter euthanizing the mouse according to the protocol approved by your own Institution, place it on the dissection stage in supine position and fix the paws in place with four needles/pins.\nSpray with 70% ethanol, cut the skin below the thoracic cavity, pull it up and place it under the two top needles/pins.\nUse a different set of tools for the internal organs (to avoid mycoplasma contamination deriving from the fur/skin).\nOpen the rib cage: hold the lower edge of the sternum and pull it slightly up, cut upward along the right side of the sternum, down on diaphragm from the right side to the left side of the mouse and finally up on the left side to expose the full cavity.",
    "Note: the heart will be pointing to the left so avoid starting the cut from the left side. This is particularly important when dissecting mice previously subjected to myocardial infarction (MI), with possible adhesion to the rib cage on the left side, and having a good view of the heart from the right side is pivotal for correct dissection without damage.\nRemove the heart (it is easier to run the tools along the abdominal aorta upward and cut the heart from the back), collect the heart still beating in a dish containing in HBSS, dissect out the atria and outflow tract, place on ice.\nCritical: If the cervical dislocation is not performed properly or the dissection takes too long and the heart is not pumping when placed in HBSS, there are high chances of getting solid blood clots in the ventricles. To reduce this risk, inject the mice intraperitoneally with Heparin, 5 min before culling, about 50 USP units per mouse. The recommended dose is 20–50 units per mL of blood; an adult mouse has an average of 58.5 mL of blood/kg body weight; 1.46 mL in 25 g mouse (https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/mouse-decision-tree-blood-sampling[href=https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/mouse-decision-tree-blood-sampling] from the National Center for Replacement Refinement & Reduction of Animals in Research).\nAlternatives: To distinguish resident from circulating immune cells, labelled antibodies can be injected intravenously 1–3 min before culling the mice as in (Cochain et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nMove to the tissue culture cabinet, cut the myocardium in small pieces 1 mm circa using a blade or scalpel, on a bacteriological petri dish. Add 1 mL of enzymatic solution and mince again to obtain pieces of homogeneous size. Transfer in a container (autoclaved Erlenmeyer flask (50 mL) with a magnetic bar) with additional 7 mL of enzymatic solution using a wide bore 1 mL transfer pipette.",
    "Alternatives: The tissue suspension can also be transferred using a 10 mL serological pipette; or 1 mL pipette tip, modified by cutting the narrow-edge of about 2 mm with a blade.\nNote: aspirate some enzymatic solution before collecting the tissue fragments to avoid unwanted adhesion to the dry plastic surface of tip/pipette.\nPlace the flask in the glass troughs filled with distilled water pre-warned at 37°C on the magnetic stirrer.\nLeave in agitation 250 rpm at 37°C for the first 15 min digestion. After gently pipetting the suspension, collect the supernatant in the pre-assembled collection tube on ice (50 mL tube topped with a 40 μm cell strainer, pre-wet with 1 mL of FBS). Leave the remaining tissue fragments in the flask and add 7 mL of enzymatic solution for a second 15 min digestion at 37°C.\nWash cell strainer with 3 mL of wash buffer (2% FCS in PBS)\nAfter the second digestion, collect the cell suspension through the strainer and wash with 3 mL of wash buffer.\nNote: During the digestion pre-warn 1 mL aliquots of RBC lysis buffer at 37°C, in 1.5 mL tubes (one per each sample).\nSpin down the cell suspension preferably in a refrigerated centrifuge, 30 s at 600 × g, 5 min at 300 × g.\nRed blood cell removal: resuspend the cell pellets in 1 mL pre-warmed RBC lysis buffer and transfer in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. After 1 min, spin down in a refrigerated microcentrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant, resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of wash buffer and spin down at 300 × g for 5 min.",
    "Alternatives: to reduce one centrifugation step, the RBC lysis can be also done in the original 50 mL collection tube. After 1 min, dilute with 10 mL wash buffer and spin down at 300 × g for 5 min.\nCritical: It is important to perform RBC lysis before the dead cell removal to prevent unspecific depletion of viable immune cells. Immune cells can interact with activated platelets, which bind the magnetic microbeads in presence of Ca+2. Therefore, complexes of immune cells and platelets could be retained in the magnetic columns and depleted.\nDead cell removal: remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 200 μL dead cell removal beads. Incubate 10 min at 20°C–22°C in the dark. Place empty 50 mL tubes under each exit port of the AutoMACS; the live cells will be eluted through the negative selection port (“neg”) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). Transfer the beads-cell suspension in a 15 mL tube with 6 mL of binding buffer, and place it under the uptake port. Using the touchscreen, select the “Separation” menu and the depletion program “DepleteS” (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 3C). After completion start the “QRinse” cleaning program before performing the separation on the next sample. Estimated time of DepleteS and QRinse is about 5 min per sample, and the live cells will be eluted in about 8 mL of running buffer.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/172-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "(E) Each pellet is resuspended in in 500 μL of FACS buffer with DRAQ5. PI is added after 5 min, before sorting.\n(F) Full gating strategy for the selection of single live (PI-) nucleated (DRAQ5+) cells.\nDivide the cell suspension in two flow cytometry round bottom 5 mL tubes. Spin 8 min at 400 × g (the pellet should not be too compact to avoid doublets and breaking cells) (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D and 3E).\nResuspend cell pellets in FACS buffer (500 μL/tube). Add DRAQ5 at the final concentration of 2 μM and after 5 min at 20°C–22°C, add Propidium iodine at the final concentration of 3 μM and transfer the cells on ice. Proceed to the flow cytometer. In the 5 min incubation time, prepare the collection tubes: 1.5 mL tubes with 50–100 μL collection buffer, and vortex and/or place on a tube roller shaker to equilibrate the tube walls with the buffer. The complete gating strategy can be found in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F.\nNote: The combination of DRAQ5 and PI is compatible with cells expressing green fluorescent reporter proteins as ZsGreen1 and eGFP, when using a 5-laser flow cytometer. Other combinations of dyes were tested as shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]. We tested DRAQ5 5, 10, 20 μM in combination with DAPI 180 nM (stock 1 mg/mL, diluted to 1 μg/mL used 1:20). Both dyes intercalate DNA: DRAQ5 permeates all cells, whereas DAPI permeates only dead cells. The percentage of DAPIneg DRAQ5pos cells was very similar in the three conditions (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A) but by increasing the concentration of DRAQ5, the intensity of DAPI staining would decrease, making the separation DAPIneg/DAPIpos less clear. Therefore, we used the lowest concentration of DRAQ5 (2mM) and replaced DAPI with PI which intercalates both DNA and RNA.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/172-Fig4.jpg",
    "Figure 4. Additional Combination of Dyes Tested for the Selection of Live Nucleated Cells\n(A) FACS plots showing cells labelled with DAPI (180nM) and 3 serial dilutions of DRAQ5 (0.1, 1, 10 μM).\n(B) FACS plots showing the gating strategy for cells co-labeled with PI, CalceinV450, and DRAQ5. Cells in Q1: Calcein +PI- (live metabolically active cells) and Q4: Calcein-PI- were further subclustered based on the DRAQ5 expression (right panels, top and bottom, respectively). Percentages of populations are reported on each plot and presented as average ± SEM of 3 replicates.\nNote: We also tested Calcein Violet 450 AM, a dye which labels metabolically active live cells. Once inside the cell this membrane-permeable compound is converted by intracellular esterases in a membrane-impermeable violet fluorescent dye, which can be retained only by live cells with intact membrane. We tested 3 concentrations (0.1, 1, 10 μM) with incubation of 20 min or 1h at 20°C–22°C, and found that 10 μM to be the optimal concentration, labelling about 30% of total events both a 20 min and 1h. When combining PI 3 μM, DRAQ5 2 μM and Calcein 10 μM, we observed a good overlap between DRAQ5 and Calcein but about 10% of the PInegCalceinpos cells were not nucleated (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Given also the longer incubation time (20 min 20°C–22°C followed by an extra wash) we decided not to use Calcein in the final experiments.\nUse a flow cytometer temperature at 4°C, preferably with a 130 μm nozzle. Collect 24,000–32,000 events, keeping the flow rate between 900–1,100 events/s and the sorting efficiency over 90%. In these conditions, about 2 min per samples should be sufficient to collect the above-mentioned number of events. See Troubleshooting.",
    "Note: We used a 130 μm nozzle as the pressure on cells is 12 psi, which is half of the pressure exerted by a 100 μm nozzle.\nNote: We observed that with our preparation the cell counter Countess® II Automated Cell Counter underestimated the real number of cells, possibly due to the wide range of cell sizes. Additionally, time is an important factor, so rather than sorting the whole sample, counting and risking cell death post-selection, we sorted just the minimum number of events required for loading the right number of cells in the 10× Chromium chip. We aimed to load 12,000 cells per lane, which with the capture efficiency of 50% (Zheng et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]) would result in about 6,000 cells lysed and sequenced, and a low percentage of multiplets (4.6% multiplet rate). Based on previous tests and calculations we estimated an error of 20% between the number of events sorted (when sorting with a digital efficiency over 90% on our instrument, a customized FACSAria II- BD Biosciences), and the number of cells counted with a hemocytometer. With a 25% loss after centrifugation, we estimated that 32,000 events would give us 12,000 cells to load. In preparations from hearts in later phases of remodeling (d14-d28 post-MI) we observed higher efficiency of recovery (possibly due to the prevalence of larger-sized cells), therefore 24,000 events were used.\nTransfer the collection tubes with sorted cells on ice. Add 800 μL of collection buffer per tube.\nCentrifuge at 300g for 8 min in a refrigerated swing bucket microcentrifuge.",
    "Alternatives: When using a centrifuge with fixed rotor, we found that spinning for 4 min, then turning the tubes and spinning for additional 4 min, helps to collect the cells at the bottom of the tube, and reduce loss due to cells sticking to the wall of the tube. We recommend using Low Retention Tube.\nAspirate the supernatant leaving ∼40 μL of collection buffer\nProceed following the 10× Chromium protocol. In (Forte et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) we used the version 2 chemistry, according to the protocol described here (https://assets.ctfassets.net/an68im79xiti/16hQRgC8GoEgMOagGGCucm/a773eeb791949f8f9f6d6472771a7455/CG000075_Chromium_Single_Cell_3__V2_Ref_Cards_Rev_C.pdf[href=https://assets.ctfassets.net/an68im79xiti/16hQRgC8GoEgMOagGGCucm/a773eeb791949f8f9f6d6472771a7455/CG000075_Chromium_Single_Cell_3__V2_Ref_Cards_Rev_C.pdf])\nCritical: Always use fresh 80% Ethanol for all the purification steps.\nNote: Agilent Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity Chips were used for the quality control of QC the cDNA and Library samples."
