    "All animal procedures described in this protocol were conducted in accordance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUCs) at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.\n1. Aspiration of Bone Marrow (BM) Cells from the Femur\nAnesthetize the mouse which will undergo femoral bone marrow aspiration with isoflurane (1-4%) administered with a precision vaporizer. Depth of anesthesia should be monitored every 5-10 min throughout the procedure by observing that there is no change in respiratory rate associated with surgical manipulation and/or ear, toe, and tail pinch. Anesthesia is induced with isoflurane and also maintained throughout the procedure with isoflurane. A pre-emptive pre-procedural dose of buprenorphine at a dose of 0.05-0.1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 6-12 hr can be used to prevent pain associated with the procedure as an adjunct to the Carprofen.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes of the mouse following induction of anesthesia to prevent corneal drying.\nThe fur is carefully clipped from an area of skin approximately 150% larger than the area of the intended aspiration site.  Loose fur is removed with a moist gauze pad. Please keep the mouse on a circulating warm water pad or other safe thermostatically controlled surface to prevent hypothermia during the procedure.\nDisinfect the entire leg containing the femur which will undergo aspiration with three sets of alternating scrubs (alternating with either a povidone-iodine (Betadine) or a chlorhexidine  (Nolvasan) scrub and 70% isopropyl alcohol or 70% ethanol soaked gauze sponges).\nWet a 0.5 ml Tuberculin Syringe (volume: 0.5 cc; gauge: 27.5 G) with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before aspirating the BM. Fill the syringe with 200-500 μl of PBS and immediately expel the PBS. Repeat this procedure 2-3 times.",
    "Keep the tibia bent from the femur by pushing the tibia with either the ring finger or the fifth finger.  Confirm that a suitable anesthetic plane has been attained. The syringe is held using the thumb and the index finger. This allows the condyles to be exposed and facilitates insertion of the needle. \nAfter wetting the syringe, insert the needle through the patellar tendon so that the needle is lodged securely between the two condyles of the femur. By holding the diaphysis close to the epiphysis of the femur with the thumb and the index finger, the needle is inserted into the shaft of the femur easily.\nSwivel the needle outward and upward so that it is parallel with the shaft of the femur. This action facilitates retrieval of bone marrow contents from the femur shaft.\nTurn the needle clockwise and counterclockwise while pushing it slowly into the femoral marrow cavity.  Confirm the correct positioning of the needle by gently moving the syringe laterally.",
    "Gently pull the needle plunger back, creating negative pressure, while moving the needle back and forth within the BM cavity. Note: The volume of BM aspirated will be approximately 5 µl which typically corresponds to 0.4-0.8 x 106 mononuclear cells. Successful aspiration will be confirmed visually by the appearance of blood in the top of the needle in the base of the syringe. If no blood is seen in the syringe it is likely that a small bone or tissue fragment is stuck in the needle. This can be removed from the needle by moving the plunger up and down in PBS (this is one reason why the syringe should be prefilled with PBS before aspirating the BM). If the tissue cannot be dislodged from the syringe, use a new needle and syringe (again wet the syringe with 200-500 µl of PBS).\nOnce BM is successfully aspirated from the femur, remove the needle and syringe from the femur and mouse.\nMove aspirated BM to a microfuge tube prefilled with 500 µl of PBS. For most applications, the BM cells should then be kept on ice until further processing if possible.\n\t Following completion of the procedure, administer analgesic with carprofen 5 mg/kg subcutaneously.  Then remove mouse from the anesthesia and place on a heated pad until fully recovered. NOTE: There should be no complication or distress experienced following the aspiration procedure if done properly.",
    "Before returning mice to the housing area, ensure they are able to ambulate and reach food and water.  Observe the mice for signs of distress or infection post procedure in the next 24 hr. Signs include: constant bleeding, anemia, lethargy. If any of these signs are seen post procedure, the animal(s) should be euthanized. Note: BM aspiration/sampling can be repeated but the repeat procedure should be performed  on the opposite femur to prevent repeated trauma to the same leg. There is little information available regarding the frequency that BM aspiration can be performed. Femoral bone marrow aspiration is generally repeated no more frequently than every 2 weeks.\n\t\n2. Assessment of Cellular Content in Aspirated BM Cells\nPellet cells retrieved from BM aspiration and place in a microfuge tube by centrifugation at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 oC or RT.\nAspirate the supernatant and then resuspend the pellet in 500 µl of ACK red blood cell lysis buffer (“ammonium-chloride-potassium” lysis buffer).\nIncubate the cells in red cell lysis buffer for 10 min and then add 1 ml of PBS and spin down the mixture again at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 oC or RT. Note: The red blood cell lysed pellet now consists of BM mononuclear cells. These can be resuspended for FACS staining, cell counting, transplantation, cytospin analysis and/or any other use (just as BM cells harvested from sacrificed mice would be used).\nSubscription Required.
