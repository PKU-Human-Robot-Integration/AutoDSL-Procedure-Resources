    "Sample preparation for the membrane permeability assayInoculate a single colony of E. coli XJ141026 into 5 ml LB broth in a glass culture tube and incubate it overnight in a shaking incubator at 220 rpm at 37 °C.Take 0.1 ml of stationary growth phase of the E. coli XJ141026 culture and inoculate 10 ml of the LB broth in a 50 ml glass conical flask. Allow the culture to grow for 12 h at 37 °C and 220 rpm.Add 100 μl of LB broth to 8 wells of the 96-well microtiter plate. Transfer 100 μl of the culture to the first well and make serial twofold dilutions in the LB broth (final volume of 100 μl per well). Determine the OD600 of each well via the microplate spectrophotometer.Calculate the dilution factor according to the above serial OD600 values. Dilute a portion of the remaining culture to OD600 = 0.1 (determined by using the microplate spectrophotometer with a sample volume of 100 μl) in the LB broth to obtain 40 ml diluted bacterial suspension.Transfer the diluted bacterial suspension into two 50 ml glass conical flasks, 15 ml per group.Add 12 μl of 1,000 μM thanatin (dissolved in sterile PBS) to one of the 15 ml bacterial suspensions, in which the final concentration of thanatin is 0.8 μM. Add an equal volume of sterile PBS (pH = 7.2) to the other flask and use as the untreated control. Mix well and grow at 37 °C and 220 rpm.Collect the samples of thanatin-treated and untreated cultures at the different time intervals of 0, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min. For each group, 2 ml culture was collected and separately added into two 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes, 1 ml per tube.Pellet the cells at 8,935 x g for 10 min in 1.",
    "5 ml Eppendorf tubes, and remove the supernatant.Wash the cells through resuspension in 1 ml of 5 mM HEPES and 5 mM glucose buffer (pH = 7.2) and the pellet cells via centrifugation at 8,935 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant.Repeat Step A9 twice.Resuspend the cells in 1 ml of 5 mM HEPES and 5 mM glucose buffer (pH = 7.2).Outer membrane permeabilityTo determine the outer membrane permeability of thanatin, add 8 μl of 500 μM NPN (dissolved in acetone) to 1 ml resuspended cells (A11) and vortex well.Incubate in darkness for 30 min at room temperature.Turn on the fluorescence spectrometer, and allow the lamp to warm up for 30 min.Define the operating parameters of the spectrometer as follows: photomultiplier tube (PMT) voltage: 700 V, excitation wavelength: 350 nm, and emission wavelength: 420 nm.Note: The PMT voltage settings are machine- and sample-dependent. To prevent the fluorescence signal values from exceeding the measurement range, the appropriate PMT voltage for the experiments must be established before a series of experiments is started. To set the appropriate PMT voltage, collect and stain the antimicrobial agent-treated bacteria at the last time point of the experiment, detect the fluorescence signal using different PMT voltages, and choose the optimal PMT voltage that can maximally amplify the signal in the detector range. Carefully clean a fluorescence cuvette with water and ethanol.Transfer 1 ml of the incubated culture to the cuvette and place it in the spectrometer.Start the data acquisition and record.Inner membrane permeabilityTo determine the inner membrane permeability of thanatin, add 5 μl of 1 mM PI (dissolved in sterile ddH2O) to 1 ml of resuspended cells (A11).Incubate in darkness for 30 min at room temperature.",
