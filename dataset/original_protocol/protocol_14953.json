    "All animal experiments were approved by the Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz (LANUV) according to German Animal Protection Law.\n1. Materials and Experimental Setup\nAnimal care\n\t\nUse female or male mice of any strain weighing 20 to 25 g and house them according to local animal care legislation.\nFeed mice with special chow for rodents and apply alfalfa-free chow at least three days prior to fluorescence examinations to minimize endoluminal auto-fluorescence.\nProvide autoclaved drinking water ad libitum.\nInduction of acute DSS-induced colitis\n\t\nPrepare a 3% (w/v) dextran sulfate sodium (DSS, molecular weight: 36,000–50,000 Da) solution by dissolving 3 g of DSS in 100 ml autoclaved water. Offer this solution as the exclusive drinking water to mice ad libitum and calculate 5 ml of DSS-solution per mouse/day. Feed control mice with autoclaved water without DSS ad libitum9.\nInduction of colorectal cancer\n\t\nDissolve mutagenic azoxymethane (AOM) (CAUTION! May cause cancer and genetic damage!) in sterile isotonic saline to obtain a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Apply a single dose of 10 mg AOM per kg bodyweight intra-peritoneally using a 1 ml syringe (30 G)10.\nChallenge mice (excluding control mice) with repetitive cycles of 3% (w/v) DSS from day 0 to 7, day 14 to 21, day 28 to 35 and day 42 to 49 to induce inflammatory driven colorectal cancerogenesis. Feed mice with autoclaved water only in between these challenges (see Figure 4A for a detailed time schedule). Feed control mice with autoclaved water throughout the experiment.\nPreparation of fluorescence endoscopy (FE)\n\t\nUse Fluorescein-Isothiocyanat (FITC) - dextran (molecular weight 70,000 Da; FITC:Glucose = 1:250) for detection of colonic adenoma by visual enhancement of dysplasia associated vascular pattern.\nAdminister 60 mg FITC-conjugated dextran diluted in 100 µl PBS intravenously 5 min before fluorescence endoscopic examination.\nAnesthesia",
    "Provide continuous isoflurane supply for anesthesia (1.5 L O2/min; 1.5–2 vol% isoflurane [2-chloro-2-(difluoromethoxy)-1,1,1-trifluoro-ethane]). Use special veterinary anesthesia equipment with a facemask to tightly control anesthesia.\nPreparation of enema\n\t\nInstill 2 ml of fluid enema (contents: disodium hydrogenphosphate 1.5% (w/v) and sodium dihydrogenphosphate 11% (w/v)) into the colon if significant fecal loading is suspected that may obscure the view.\n2. Technical Equipment\nUse a veterinary endoscopic workstation that is developed and approved for the use of small animal endoscopy. Connect the workstation to a camera unit, a xenon light source, an air pump and to a conventional PC monitor for white light endoscopy. Then connect the camera and the miniature rigid telescope (1.9 mm outer diameter, 10 cm length; Figure 5).\nUse endoscope sheath with working channel (Figure 5D) for the application of biopsy forceps or injection tube. Use the sheath without working channel for diagnostic colonoscopy.\nConfigure the settings of the light source for fluorescence endoscopy to excite used tracers (e.g., 490 nm for FITC-conjugated dextran). Additionally, integrate an appropriate bandpass filter between the telescope and the camera (e.g., 525 nm for FITC-conjugated dextran).\nInsert flexible biopsy forceps (3 Charr., 28 cm) through the working channel of the endoscope to obtain biopsies.\nIntroduce flexible injection tube (0.96 mm) through the working channel for topical, intramucosal or endoluminal administration of diagnostic or therapeutic agents.\nUse a heatable examination table with a temperature of 42 °C. This prevents mice becoming hypothermic during the examination.\n3. Anesthesia of Animals\nPlace mouse in a small but leakproof box and administer isoflurane (100% (v/v), 5 vol%, 3 L/min). Wait until the mouse loses consciousness.",
    "Transfer the mouse onto the examination table for endoscopy. Continue isoflurane inhalation via face mask with a dose 100% v/v, 1.5 vol%, 1.5 L/min. Always apply eye ointment to prevent eye dryness while under anesthesia.\nEvaluate efficacy of anesthesia by checking the reflexes. Check the ‘turn around reflex’: if sufficiently anaesthetized, a mouse laying on its back should not turn around. Check the ‘toes reflex’: when anesthesia is adequate, soft pinching in between the animal’s toes should not lead to withdrawal of leg (stage of surgical tolerance).\n4. Colonoscopy\nLay anesthetized mouse prone /on its back on the examination table.\nAdminister 2 ml of enema via buttoned cannula into the colon if significant fecal loading is suspected that may obscure the view. Wait for mice to defecate after administering the enema. Insert the endoscope very carefully to avoid perforation.\nOpen both valves of the sheath with one of them being connected to the air pump. Seal the other valve with your index finger to dispense air. Inflate colon with air, slowly and carefully, especially in case of biopsy or injection.\nAdvance endoscope only as far as the right colonic flexure to avoid perforation (4–5 cm from anus).\nDiagnostic colonoscopy\n\t\nExamine the mucosa for inflammatory or malignant alterations while pulling back the endoscope. Pull back slowly to assess the whole circumference of the bowel. Assess intraluminal pathologies using appropriate established scoring systems as required.\nTo warrant identical endoscopic position for image acquisition during repetitive visualizations of wound areas, note the distance between the murine anus and the mucosal lesion. Moreover, use the tip of the biopsy forceps as a spacer to achieve identical distance between the endoscope and the wound area during image acquisition. The wound size is related to the size of the endoscope sheath, which comprises 3 mm.",
    "NOTE: Place endoscope in identical position by optical comparison with photo documentation of previous examinations. Measure lesions in the same angle and distance at each follow up endoscopic examination.\nBiopsy procedure\n\t\nTake biopsies with the help of two investigators. Introduce the biopsy forceps carefully through the working channel until the tip of the forceps is visible on the monitor to the second investigator. Open and close forceps carefully to avoid perforation.\nMove forceps to the site of pathology.\nInjection procedure\n\t\nPerform injection procedure with the help of two investigators. Pre-fill flexible injection tube (0.96 mm) completely with the agent to be administered. Push tube through the working channel until the cannula (30 G) is visible on the monitor to the second investigator. Prepare the fine syringe and gently administer the requested amount of diagnostic or therapeutic agent. Injection volumes should be 50 µl maximum.\nInsert the needle into the submocosa at an angle of 15–30 degrees. Face the bevel in direction of the mucosa. The mucosa shows a characteristic lifting sign after successful injection.\nFluorescence endoscopy (FE)\n\t\nAdminister 60 mg FITC-conjugated dextran diluted in 100 µl PBS intravenously prior to fluorescence endoscopic examination.\nCheck the optimal time point between injection of your fluorescent labeled tracer and the imaging procedure which is dependent on tracer pharmacology. Configure settings of bandpass filter system in accordance to excitation and emission wavelength of the tracer used. Perform fluorescence endoscopy for non-specific blood volume tracers (e.g., FITC) immediately after intravenous injection of the fluorescent dye to assess the vascular pattern of the mucosal surface.\nConsider imaging several hours after tracer application in case of targeted tracers or ‘smart probes’ to provide a better target to background-ratio.\nPerform photo- and video-documentation of the results.\n5. Post-colonoscopy",
    "Separate the mouse in a vacant cage and lay it on a paper towel to protect the mouse from aspirating the litter. Warm the mouse with a redlight lamp to prevent hypothermia. Observe the mouse and do not leave unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Once completely conscious, place the mouse back to its respective cage.\nAt the end of experiment, place mouse in a small but leakproof box and administer CO2 (100% (v/v), 100 vol%, 3 L/min). Wait until the mouse loses complete consciousness and stops breathing. Dispatch mouse by neck fracture. Perform abdominal laparotomy and explant the colon. Open the colon longitudinally and wash it for further histological or molecular evaluation.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
