    "Activating Dowex 1x8-400 Anion Exchange Resin.Prepare large batches of Dowex resin:Dissolve 400 g Dowex resin in 4 L 1 M NaOH.Mix solution at room temperature for 15 min.Note: To mix, a magnetic stir plate was used. Allow resin to settle by gravity and remove supernatant.Wash resin with 4 L of deionized H2O until pH 7.0, using pH paper to measure.Note: This may take up to 30 x washes. At pH 7.0, allow resin to settle and remove supernatant.Suspend resin in 4 L 1 M HCl and mix for 15 min at room temperature.Allow resin to settle and remove supernatant.Finally, wash resin in 4 L of deionized H2O 3x until pH 3.0, using pH paper to measure.Stop mixing of solution after each wash to allow resin to settle before carefully removing deionized H2O and refilling with fresh deionized H2O.Store resin in deionized H2O at 4 °C.Add ethanol and deionized H2O to resin at a 1:1:1 ratio (dowex:ethanol:dH2O) prior to use in assay.Label triplicate 1.5 ml Eppendorf® tubes per sample for assay (i.e., three technical replicates), including blanks. Incubate on ice.Thaw all stock solutions being used.Heat water-bath to 30 °C.Prepare sample(s) to be assayed.Incubate appropriate volume/concentration of PDE containing sample in 50 µl Buffer A (Recipe 1).Note: Pilot studies should be carried out to assess optimal concentration(s) of PDE containing sample being used. Typical concentration range of purified protein / PDE overexpressing cellular lysates: 1-10 μg/μl in a total volume of 50 μl Buffer A. If investigating effect of inhibitor(s), make sample up in 40 µl Buffer A and 10 µl of appropriately diluted inhibitor.Add 50 µl of Buffer A only for blanks.Add 50 µl of cAMP substrate solution (Recipe 5) to each PDE containing sample, including blanks, and vortex.",
    "Radioactively tagged cAMP in mix will be hydrolyzed to 5’-AMP in samples containing PDEs.Incubate samples in a water bath at 30 °C for 10 min.To terminate reaction (i.e., inactivate PDEs in sample), boil samples at 100 °C for 2 min.Cool samples on ice for 15 min.Add 1 mg/ml snake venom to each sample (i.e., 0.2 mg/ml final concentration), including blanks, and mix.Note: Snake venom dephosphorylates the 5’-AMP to adenosine, preventing 5’-AMP from recircularising into cAMP. Incubate samples in a water bath at 30 °C for a further 10 min.Add 400 µl Dowex:ethanol:dH2O mix (aka Dowex anion exchange resin) to each sample and vortex. Ensure Dowex anion exchange resin is thoroughly suspended before adding to sample(s). Dowex anion exchange resin separates negatively charged cAMP from uncharged adenosine.Cool samples on ice for a further 15 min.Vortex samples thoroughly and centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 3 min at 4 °C in a refrigerated bench-top centrifuge.Concurrently, add 1 ml of Opti-Flow SAFE 1 scintillant to freshly labeled 1.5 ml Eppendorf® tubes.Remove 150 µl of clear supernatant from PDE containing reaction samples (see Step 14) and add to a appropriate scintillant tube containing 1 ml of Opti-Flow SAFE 1 scintillation fluid.Vortex all samples thoroughly.Using a TRI-CARB 2900TR Liquid Scintillation Analyzer (Figure 2), measure/count unbound 8-[3H]-adenosine. This determines the rate of cAMP hydrolysis and thus PDE activity.Analyse data (i.e., determine PDE activity. See Tables 1 and 2 for example set up/data analyses.)Table 1.
