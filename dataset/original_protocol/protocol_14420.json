  "title": "Surgical Angiogenesis in Porcine Tibial Allotransplantation: A New Large Animal Bone Vascularized Composite Allotransplantation Model",
  "procedures": [
    "The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Mayo Clinic Rochester. Yucatan miniature swine were serving as both donors and recipients during this surgical VCA procedure. Pairing of donor and recipient was based upon DNA sequence swine leukocyte antigen (SLA) haplotyping to ensure a major mismatch in the SLAs 22,23. Animals were age- and weight-matched and of identical blood type. Two surgical teams simultaneously harvested a porcine tibial bone segment with its nutrient vessel from the donor and prepared the recipient to receive the orthopically-placed allogeneic tibial bone segment. Simultaneously with microvascular repair of the bone nutrient vessel, a recipient-derived arteriovenous bundle was placed within the tibial segment for autogenous angiogenesis.\n1. Presurgical Preparations\nFast Yucatan miniature swine the day prior to the procedure and weigh them for controlled drug administration.\nSedate animals with Xylazine (2 mg/kg) and the combination of tiletamine HCL and zolazepam HCL (5 mg/kg), administered subcutaneously.\nPlace a peripheral catheter in an ear vein for intravenous drug and saline delivery and administer buprenorphine (0.18 mg/kg) and prophylactic antibiotics (1 g cefazoline intravenous and 5 mg/kg ceftiofur intramuscular).\nShave the right hindlimb and the left neck that will serve as harvest site for the vascularized tibial bone segment and site for the placement of the central venous catheter, respectively.\nCheck vital signs and the level of sedation by testing the relaxation of mouth muscles.\nIntubate the animal with an appropriately sized endotracheal tube in sternal recumbency24.\nTransfer the miniature swine to the operation table and connect to a ventilator machine for maintenance of anesthesia by administering isoflurane (1-3%).\nConfirm the anesthetic depth by testing palpebral, pupillary light and corneal reflexes.",
    "Monitor oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter transmission probe attached to the ear. Use a blood pressure cuff and temperature probe for intraoperative vital sign monitoring.\nPlace Yucatan miniature swine in a supine position on a warming pad. In addition, use a forced-air warming blanket during the operation to prevent hypothermia.\nUse vet ointment on eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\n2. Harvest of a Vascularized Tibial Bone Segment\nWash the right leg of each miniature swine with povidone-iodine solution. Dry the skin with a sterile towel and drape the extremity in a sterile fashion. Envelop and isolate the limb with an iodine impregnated adhesive incision drape to minimize the risk of contamination.\nPerform an incision with a scalpel anterolaterally in the hindlimb, beginning at the knee joint, extending distally along the anterior ridge of the tibia to the tibiotalar joint.\nDissect the skin and the subcutaneous tissue with scissors and retract the anterior compartment muscles from the tibia laterally.\n\tNOTE: Release of the tibialis anterior muscle origin facilitates exposure. The interosseous membrane is now exposed.\nIdentify the cranial tibial artery and vein (to be later used as the arteriovenous bundle for the surgical angiogenesis).\n\tNOTE: The cranial tibial artery and vein lie on the anterior surface of the interosseous membrane.\nTo improve the operative field of view, release a part from the tibial anterior muscle from its insertion and remove a part of the tibial ridge by using an oscillating saw.\nProtecting the cranial tibial vessels, incise the interosseous membrane beginning at the level of the tibial tubercle with a scissor.\nVisualize the caudal tibial vessels, running distally beneath the membrane.",
    "NOTE: They branch from the cranial tibial vessels and give rise to the nutrient pedicle of the tibial diaphysis just distal to the tubercle. It is now possible to visualize the nutrient foramen and vessels entering the tibia on its posterior lateral surface just distal to the tibial tubercle.\nTag the nutrient pedicle with a microclamp. Do not detach the vascular pedicle.\nIdentify a muscle branch in the tibial anterior compartment near the nutrient foramen; this may be used for the anastomosis to the vascularized bone allotransplant nutrient vessel. Mark the muscle branch with a microclamp.\nHarvest of a 3.5 cm tibial bone segment including the vascular pedicle.\nUse a cutting jig to ensure a precise and reproducible bone resection. Position and fix the cutting jig on the medial surface of the tibia to include the nutrient foramen and vessels.\n\t\t\nGuided by the jig, perform parallel bone cuts with an oscillating saw to remove a 3.5 cm tibial segment. Use the same positioning and jig for both donor and recipient animals to maximize size- and shape-match.\nOnce both cuts have been made with the oscillating saw, rotate the tibial bone segment to visualize the nutrient pedicle on the posterior surface. Divide the nutrient pedicle at its origin from the cranial tibial artery with scissors. Dissect and free the tibial segment with scissors, leaving a thin cuff of periosteum and muscle on its surface.\nRetract the tibial bone segment and elevate the tibial bone segment with its vascular pedicle with a sharp clamp, leaving the cranial tibial artery in place.\n\tNOTE: The vascularized bone segment is now ready for microvascular transfer and a 3.5 cm tibial bone defect has been created in each Yucatan miniature swine.",
    "Ligate the cranial tibial vessels at the ankle with absorbable polyglactin 3-0 sutures, freeing them with a cuff of perivascular tissue to create an arteriovenous (AV) bundle. Leave the sutures at least 5 cm long to ease the implantation into the tibial bone segment.\n3. Orthotopic Tibial Bone VCA Reconstruction in Combination with Surgical Angiogenesis\nExchange the harvested tibial bone segments with its nutrient pedicles between the two animals to use them as bone VCAs.\nTo allow passage of the cranial tibial arteriovenous (AV) bundle into the tibial bone segment, remove the V shaped segment from the proximal junction site using the oscillating saw.\nDrill a hole of 0.5 cm diameter in the distal part of the tibial bone defect site and into the medullary canal of the tibial bone segment and introduce the recipient AV bundle that has been ligated distally, into the intramedullary canal to promote subsequent autogenous new blood supply.\nPlace the vascularized tibial bone segment orthotopically into the recipient defect.\nAnastomose the nutrient pedicle of the tibial bone segment to the prepared muscle branch of the tibial anterior compartment in an end-to end manner using the simple interrupted suture technique and 9-0 sutures25.\nConfirm patency of the microvascular anastomosis using the milking test26.\nAchieve osteosynthesis by using a 9-hole 3.5 mm locking plate.\nPlace the 9-hole plate on the tibia anteromedially. Fix the plate with three bicortical screws above and below the tibial bone segment. Additionally, place unicortical screws in the tibial bone segment for internal fixation. To confirm correct positioning of the bone VCA and plate, use anteroposterior and lateral radiographs.\nPerform fascial and layered skin closure using interrupted 3-0 and 2-0 absorbable sutures. Finally seal the wound with an occlusive transparent dressing.\n4. Central Venous Catheter Placement in Jugular External Vein",
    "For postoperative drug administration and immunosuppressive (IS) drug level monitoring, place a venous catheter into the external jugular vein using an open technique. Perform the placement at the conclusion of the allotransplantation procedure under anesthesia (see section 1).\nPerform an anterolateral incision in the neck with a scalpel. Dissect the subcutaneous tissue with scissors and expose the left jugular vein.\nPlace a Hickman catheter into the jugular vein through a small hole in the external jugular vein and secure it with non-absorbable sutures. Exteriorize the catheter in the back by tunneling subcutaneously.\nSecure the catheter in place to the skin and close the neck in layers using interrupted 3-0 and 2-0 absorbable sutures.\nPlace occlusive bandages over the incision. Use a fishnet bandage to hold the bandages and the catheter in place.\n5. Postoperative Treatment and Follow Up\nImmediately after the operation, treat the Yucatan miniature swine with an intramuscular injection of carprofen (4 mg/kg) for postoperative analgesia. Administer buprenorphine (0.18 mg/kg) to treat pain of high intensity as needed.\nAllow the pig to recover for 60 min and then return the pig to a special intensive care unit pan and monitor closely until complete recovery.\nMove the Yucatan miniature swine to a normal cage and provide ad libitum access to water and food.\nAdminister tacrolimus (0.8-1.5 mg/kg/day) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (50-70 mg/kg/day) orally and methylprednisolone sodium succinate intravenously (starting with 500 mg/day) for two weeks.\nAdjust daily doses of immunosuppressive drugs according to trough blood levels, aiming for 5.0-30.0 ng/mL for tacrolimus and 1.0-3.5 Âµg/mL for MMF, respectively. Reduce the dose of methylprednisolone gradually until the maintenance dose of 50 mg per day is reached.\nAdminister prophylactic antibiotics gentamicin (3 mg/kg intravenously) and ceftiofur (5 mg/kg intramuscularly) for two weeks.\nSubscription Required.
