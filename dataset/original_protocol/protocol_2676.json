This is performed on both the full-length and truncated constructs of the GalNAc-T, with the two-point mutations introduced in a sequential manner.\nSite directed mutagenesis (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).\nFor this step we use the Q5® Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (https://international.neb.com/protocols/2013/01/26/q5-site-directed-mutagenesis-kit-protocol-e0554[href=https://international.neb.com/protocols/2013/01/26/q5-site-directed-mutagenesis-kit-protocol-e0554]).\nIt is advisable to run the PCR product on an agarose gel to confirm the success of the PCR reaction prior to the KLD treatment.\nPurify plasmid DNA by Miniprep.\nPick a single colony from the transformed bacteria and inoculate a 3 mL culture of LB medium containing the appropriate selection antibiotic.\nThe tip used to pick the bacterial colony can be used to streak an appropriate selection agar plate before placing the tip into the LB culture to have a backup.\nIncubate at 37°C for at least 6 h (preferably for 16–20 h) in a shaking incubator at >200 rpm.\nTransfer 2 mL of the culture into a 15 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuge at >10,000 × g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nWe use the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit and a microcentrifuge to purify and isolate the plasmid DNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/download.aspx?id=22df6325-9579-4aa0-819c-788f73d81a09&lang=en[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/download.aspx?id=22df6325-9579-4aa0-819c-788f73d81a09&lang=en]).\nConfirm the presence of the point mutation and the absence of any undesired mutations by Sanger Sequencing.\nRepeat steps 1–3 to introduce the second point mutation.\nOnce the presence of both mutations has been confirmed by Sanger Sequencing, use a positive colony to inoculate a 100 mL culture of LB medium containing the appropriate selection antibiotic.",
    "Incubate at 37°C for at least 6 h (preferably for 16–20 h) in a shaking incubator at >200 rpm.\nPurify plasmid DNA by Maxiprep.\nWe use the ZymoPURE™ II Plasmid Maxiprep Kit and a vacuum manifold according to the manufacturer’s instructions (https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d4202_d4203_zymopure_ii_plasmid_maxiprep.pdf[href=https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d4202_d4203_zymopure_ii_plasmid_maxiprep.pdf]).\nPause point: The PCR products can be stored at −20°C before performing the KLD reaction. The KLD reaction products can be stored at −20°C before performing the transformation step.\nNote: We recommend using the pDONR221 and pGEN2-DEST vectors for the full-length and truncated constructs respectively which are commercially available in DNASU. We have observed that the mutagenesis efficiency strongly depends on the vector used therefore if alternative constructs are used the mutagenesis protocol may need to be optimized accordingly.\nProtein expression and Ni-NTA purification of WT and BH GalNAc-T\nTiming: 2 weeks\nThis step is performed to express purified recombinant His-tagged truncated WT and BH GalNAc-Ts.\nExpress His-tagged truncated WT and BH GalNAc-T in Expi293F™ cells (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]).\nTransfect the cells with the expression plasmids coding His-tagged truncated WT and BH GalNAc-T using the ExpiFectamine™ 293 Transfection Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0007814_Expi293_ExpressionSystem_UG.pdf[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0007814_Expi293_ExpressionSystem_UG.pdf]).\nAfter four days centrifuge the cells at 200 × g for 5 min, collect and filter the supernatant.\nWe use Steritop Threaded Bottle Top Filters to filter the collected supernatant.\nPurify His-tagged truncated WT and BH GalNAc-T by Ni-NTA purification.\nAdd 1 mM NiSO4 to the collected supernatant.\nThis step is performed to prevent non-specific binding to the beads.\nIncubate for 15 min at 4°C on a tube roller shaker.\nCondition Ni-NTA® Agarose beads three times with 5 column volumes (CV) of water and twice with 5 CV of Wash buffer.\nAdd the supernatant to the beads.\nIncubate the samples for 16–20 h at 4°C on a tube roller shaker.",
    "Wash the beads three times with 10 CV of Wash Buffer.\nElute the protein by adding 2 CV of:\n20% Elution Buffer (100 mM imidazole = 4/5 Wash Buffer and 1/5 Elution Buffer).\n40% Elution Buffer (200 mM imidazole = 3/5 Wash Buffer and 2/5 Elution Buffer).\n40% Elution Buffer (200 mM imidazole = 3/5 Wash Buffer and 2/5 Elution Buffer).\n60% Elution Buffer (300 mM imidazole = 2/5 Wash Buffer and 3/5 Elution Buffer).\nDialyze the eluted protein for 16–20 h using SnakeSkin™ Dialysis Tubing against Freezing Buffer.\nDetermine the protein concentration.\nAliquot, flash-freeze in liquid nitrogen and store at −80°C.\nWT and BH GalNAc-T should be stable for months when stored at −80°C in Freezing Buffer.\nNote: We recommend determining the protein concentration by densitometry of Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel bands and comparison to known standards of bovine serum albumin since certain components in the enzyme preparation (e.g., imidazole) may interfere with measurements performed by BCA assay or Nanodrop.\nIn vitro glycosylation experiments\nTiming: 2 days\nThis step assesses and compares the enzymatic activities of the WT and BH systems. To ensure successful bump-and-hole engineering, the BH GalNAc-T must remain biochemically competent whilst orthogonal to the WT enzyme. Moreover, to ensure that bump-and-hole engineering does not affect the enzyme’s peptide substrate affinity and specificity this experiment should also be carried out with a small panel of synthetic peptides.\nMix the following reagents in PCR tubes:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2330_6.csv\nIncubate at 37°C for 16–20 h.\nQuench by heating at 95°C for 10 s before placing on ice.\nDetermine glycopeptide formation by HPLC-MS and MS+ peak integration (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]) using Equation 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2330-Fig6.jpg",

However, the chromatography method may need to be optimized to separate the peptide starting material and glycopeptide product peaks. The UDP-GloTM Glycosyltransferase Assay may also be used as an alternative way of quantifying the activity of the enzymes, however it will not take into account UDP-sugar hydrolysis which may skew the results.",
    "Note: The activity of the enzymes may vary between GalNAc-Ts and enzyme preparations. The conditions of the glycosylation reaction may therefore need to be optimized accordingly. We have demonstrated that accurate quantification by MS+ peak integration is possible due to comparable ionization efficiencies of the peptide starting material and glycopeptide product. Nevertheless, since ion counts might differ between (glyco-)peptides it is recommended that whenever a new (glyco-)peptide is used that the ion count is compared against the native enzyme-substrate pair to confirm that this is the case. We have previously demonstrated that compound 1 is compatible with several GalNAc-Ts for the BH approach in that orthogonal enzyme activity is observed for compound 1 as a substrate (activity is observed with BH GalNAc-T only, with comparable glycopeptide turnover to the native system).12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] However, alternative UDP-GalNAc analogues may be investigated for other GalNAc-T systems.\nMichaelis-Menten kinetics\nTiming: 2 days\nThis step confirms whether the BH GalNAc-T/compound 1 pair retains the kinetic parameters of its WT GalNAc-T/UDP-GalNAc counterpart. First, the enzyme concentration at which ∼10%–20% glycopeptide formation is achieved needs to be determined and this value is chosen to fulfill the prerequisites of the Michaelis-Menten kinetics.\nSet up in vitro glycosylation reactions using different WT and BH GalNAc-T concentrations: 2 nM, 4 nM, 8 nM, 16 nM, 32 nM, 64 nM.\nFor less active enzymes, higher enzyme concentrations might be needed.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2330_7.csv\nIncubate at 37°C for 1.5 h.\nQuench by heating at 95°C for 10 s before placing on ice.\nDetermine glycopeptide formation by HPLC-MS and MS+ peak integration using Equation 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd1].\nDetermine the enzyme concentration at which ∼10%–20% glycopeptide formation is obtained (starting kinetics).\nSet up in vitro glycosylation reactions using the determined enzyme concentration and different UDP-sugar concentrations: 15.6 μM, 32.2 μM, 62.5 μM, 125 μM, 250 μM, 500 μM.",

If any of the requirements of Michaelis-Menten kinetics are not fulfilled, the model will be unsuitable. Furthermore, not all enzymes adhere to Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The Michaelis-Menten equation describes a rectangular hyperbola. If the plot of initial rate of reaction against substrate concentration does not display this behavior, alternative kinetic models may be more suitable.\nNote: Higher WT and BH GalNAc-T enzyme concentrations can be investigated. The peptide concentration used in the experiment using different UDP-sugar concentrations will depend on the Km of the GalNAc-T with the peptide used. We chose 1.5 h as a convenient endpoint to measure glycopeptide formation at the initial stage of the reaction. Alternative timepoints may be used instead as long as ∼10% glycopeptide formation is obtained.

    "Critical: As the CF680 picolyl azide is light-sensitive, once the CuAAC solution is added to the samples these should be covered with aluminum foil. The Revert™ Destaining Solution should not be left for longer than 10 min. Compound 1 has been shown to be accepted by GALE,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] an epimerase which catalyzes the interconversion of UDP-GalNAc and UDP-GlcNAc in living cells. This means that the alkyne-containing UDP-GlcNAc analogue product of the epimerization reaction may be incorporated into GlcNAc-containing extracellular glycoproteins, such as N-glycans. PNGase F treatment of the cell lysates is therefore crucial to remove N-glycans prior to analysis. This helps discern between N- and O-glycans and reduces background fluorescence.\nNote: The cell lysates can be stored at −20°C for short-term storage or at −80°C for long-term storage. We recommend using K-562 cells to assess whether the approach works. Other cell lines may need optimization in constructs, sugar concentration and feeding time. We also recommend using constructs with both AGX1 and GalNAc-T on the same plasmid. Co-transfection or sequential transfection has led to inferior labeling outcomes in the past. This may be particularly important in the case of cell lines that make elaborated O-glycans, as these likely incorporate the GlcNAc derivative into their O-glycans. Many cancer cell lines have short O-GalNAc glycans and are easier to use in this procedure. Analyzing in-gel fluorescence from glycoproteins labeled with the CF680 fluorophore using a laser-scanning system has given the best results. Other read-outs e.g., using alternative fluorophores, camera-based imagers or blots to visualize the labelled glycoproteins have led to lower signals. We use an Odyssey CLx Imager and Image Studio software for image acquisition and processing.",

To characterize O-GalNAc glycans specifically, the lysates should be treated with PNGase F prior to the click reaction or GALE KO cells should be used for the experiment. We recommend using Protein LoBind® Tubes throughout the procedure to minimize sample loss due to protein-surface binding.\nPause point: The whole cell lysates can be stored at –20°C prior to the click reaction. The clicked lysates can also be stored at –20°C prior to the protein precipitation. Combined supernatants after protein precipitation and resuspension can be stored at –20°C prior to enrichment. The dried pellets before sample-desalting can be stored at –80°C. The dried pellets after sample-desalting can be stored at −80°C.\nNote: The protein expression levels, sugar feeding conditions and click reaction efficiency may vary between cell lines so the experimental conditions might need to be optimized. The cells should be 30%–60% confluent at the time of sugar feeding. We recommend detaching the cells by pipetting using a 1 mL pipette since we have seen that scraping can lead to a lower cell viability.",
    "Optional: When desalting the peptides, the flow-through may be collected after loading the sample and washing the column in case not all the sample is retained in the column. If the secretome is to be analyzed instead of whole cell lysates the procedure is the same with the exception that serum-free medium should be used and two 15 cm dishes should be prepared per sample instead of one. After sugar feeding and incubation for 16–20 h, the secretome can be collected and harvested to remove cellular debris. The samples can then be concentrated to 200 μL using Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filters (3 kDa MWCO) and the medium exchanged with PBS. Even though we haven’t done this ourselves, if one would like to estimate the amount of protein bound to the neutravidin beads during the enrichment step we believe that the AVIDITY assay34[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib34] may be applicable for this purpose. The beads would have to be first incubated with HABA, the supernatant collected and the absorbance of free HABA at 350 nm measured. The supernatant would then be returned to the beads and the samples added. The supernatant would be collected and the absorbance at 350 nm measured again. Since the biotinylated glycoproteins in the samples will displace the HABA bound to the beads, measuring the change in absorbance due to free HABA in the supernatant before and after adding the samples to the beads could be used to infer the amount of proteins bound to the beads.\nMass spectrometry data acquisition\nTiming: 1 day\nThis step is performed to acquire the raw MS data from the peptide and glycopeptide fractions from lysates of cells transfected with the BH GalNAc-T system.\nPrepare Buffer A: 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in LC/MS-grade water.\nPrepare Buffer B: 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in LC/MS-grade acetonitrile.",
