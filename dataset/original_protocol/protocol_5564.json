    "AnesthesiaAfter fasting 12 h, the rat is anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (300 mg/kg, see Recipes) by intraperitoneal injection and the rat should reach surgical anesthesia within 5-10 min.Note: Depth of anesthesia is assessed by corneal blink and tail-pinch reflexes. Surgery should not be operated until the rat has reached full anesthesia. Anesthesia should be maintained at least for 1 h to complete all surgical procedures. Expose the common carotid artery of rat (Video 1).    <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p>   Video 1. Expose the common carotid artery of rat. This video shows the exact surgical procedures of how to expose common carotid artery covered by omohyoideus.                                                       Note: To maintain body temperature, it is recommended to place the rat on a heating pad (37 °C) during procedures.Mount the rat onto an electric heating pad and clean the fur around neck using an electric shaver. (Figure 2A) Sterilize neck skin using 75% alcohol cotton ball and then cut a 2-cm incision above the manubrium along the anterior midline of the neck. (Figure 2B) Carefully blunted dissect hypoderm and expose the sternohyoid muscle. (Figure 2C) Carefully blunted dissect the fascia in order to expose the carotid triangle muscle structure that is consist of posterior belly of digastric muscle, omohyoideus and sternocleidomastoid, and then vertically separate omohyoideus to finally expose the sheath for crucial vessels and nerves. (Figure 2D)Note: Within the exposed triangle area, two important vessels and nerve trunks could be identified, including internal vein and common carotid artery with their tributaries, and Vagus and aortic depressor nerve (50-80 μm varying upon the age and gender) that commonly located between carotid artery and Vagus. The dark red pulse-free internal vein mostly covered by sternocleidomastoid muscle is located outside the red pulsing common carotid artery. So they can be easily distinguished by the color and pulse.",
    "Importantly, Careful attention would be necessary for successful surgery during the blunted dissection to avoid damaging both nerves.Separate the common carotid artery from the Vagus and aortic depressor nerve. (Video 2)    <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p>   Video 2. Separate the common carotid artery from the Vagus and aortic depressor nerve  Carefully peel off the sheath around the common carotid artery. (Figure 2E)Slightly lift up the common carotid artery with one forceps and gently separate vagal nerve from the common carotid artery using the glass hook. (Figure 2F)Note: More attention should be paid to avoid the damage of the Vagus as well as aortic depressor never, as the damage can induce vegetative nerve functional disturbance and increase mortality rate.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171227/20171227181239_1998.jpgFigure 2. The Procedures 2-6 of 2VO rat model. A. Mount the rat to the heating pad; B. Cut a 2.0 cm incision above the manubrium; C. Expose the sternohyoid muscle; D. Expose the carotid triangle muscle structures that are consist of posterior belly of digastric muscle, omohyoideus and sternocleidomastoid; E. Carefully peel off the carotid sheath; F. Separate the Vagus from the common carotid artery; G. Permanently ligate the bilateral common carotid artery; H. Schematic diagram of permanent ligation of bilateral common carotid artery; I. Cut off the common carotid artery in between the two ligated silk sutures; J. Schematic diagram of cutting off the common carotid artery in between the two ligated silk sutures; K. Use 20 mg/ml gentamycin sulfate solution to avoid potential postoperative infection; L. Close the wounds.Permanently ligate or cut off the common carotid artery. (Video 3)    <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p>   Video 3. Permanently ligate or cut off the common carotid artery  Clamp the common carotid artery using two artery clips at the heart and head side each to avoid bleeding. (Figure 2G) Two 3-0 silk sutures (immersed in the 0.",
    "9% sterile sodium chloride) are placed beneath the common carotid artery with the help of forceps and right in between the clips (Figures 2G and 2H). For the permanent ligation of the common carotid artery, silk sutures are tightened up and then the common carotid artery is cut off in between the two ligated silk sutures (Figures 2I and 2J). Gently take off the artery clips.During the surgical procedures, the medical absorbent cotton would be necessary to remove any potential bleeding and exudates to reduce the chance of postoperative infection maximally.Perform the same procedures on the contralateral common carotid artery. (Video 4)    <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p>   Video 4. Permanently ligate the contralateral carotid artery  Postoperative caringAfter the surgical procedures, all the anterior cervical muscles should be back to their original location.To avoid potential postoperative infection, the wounds should be washed before closing by 20 mg/ml gentamycin sulfate solution and the redundant solution has to be removed completely. (Figure 2K) (Video 5)    <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p>   Video 5. Protect the wounds from infection  Close the wounds. (Figure 2L)Place the rat back to the cage, and use a warm illuminant to keep a stable temperature until the rat recovers from anesthesia that may take at least 1-2 h after the surgery."
