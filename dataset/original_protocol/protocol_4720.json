    "In the first part of this publication we will describe the quantitative capillary assay using as an example the chemotaxis towards g-aminobutyrate (GABA). These experiments have shown that P. aeruginosa PAO1 shows GABA chemotaxis and that this response is mediated by the PctC chemoreceptor (Reyes-Darias et al., 2015a). To characterize in more detail the PctC chemoreceptor, we have produced a chimeric receptor (Figure 1), which is reported in further detail (Reyes-Darias et al., 2015a). There is now a significant body of information showing that different receptor chimera constructs are functional (Feng et al., 1997; Krikos et al., 1985; Kristich et al., 2003; Repik et al., 2000; Reyes-Darias et al., 2015a; Reyes-Darias et al., 2015b; Weerasuriya et al., 1998). In the second part of this publication we will describe the gradient plate chemotaxis assay on the example of the chemoreceptor free strain E. coli UU1250 into which a construct encoding the PctC-Tar chimera had been introduced. This approach is a convenient means to determine the chemoeffector profile by in vivo experimentation.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160420/20160420022309_2079.jpg Figure 1. Construction of the PctC-Tar chimeric receptor. Tm: Transmembrane region; LBD: ligand binding domain; The HAMP linker domain (present in Histidine kinases, Adenyl cyclases, Methyl-accepting proteins and Phosphatases) is an approximately 50-amino acid alpha-helical region; MA: Methylaccepting domain; Modified version of Figure taken from (Reyes-Darias et al., 2015a).Part I. Quantitative capillary chemotaxis assayThe principle of this assay consists of immersing chemoeffector filled capillaries into a bacterial suspension. In the case of chemotaxis, cells will preferentially swim into the capillary whereas in the case of chemorepellation, fewer cells will swim into the capillary as compared to the buffer filled control capillary. Capillaries are then emptied and the number of colony forming units is determined. We detail here a modified version of the original capillary assay developed by Adler (1973).P.",
    "aeruginosa PAO1 is grown overnight (12-18 h) in LB medium (pH=7.4) on a rotator shaker at 200 rpm and 37 °C.Subsequently 0.1-0.2 ml overnight culture is transferred to 20 ml of fresh LB medium (pH=7.4) in 100 ml Erlenmeyer flasks. The initial OD600 should be between 0.05-0.07.The culture is grown to early stationary phase (OD600 0.25-0.35) at 37 °C and 200 rpm.The cells then have to be changed to an appropriate medium for mobility and chemotaxis. Wash twice 4 ml of the culture with four ml of chemotaxis buffer (HEPES, pH=7.0) by centrifuging at 1,667 x g (4 °C) for 5 min, followed by resuspension of cell pellet to a density of OD600= 0.04-0.05 in 4-8 ml of chemotaxis buffer. Harsh cell treatment may result in the loss of the flagella.Subsequently, 230 μl aliquots of bacterial suspension are placed into the wells of a 96-well plate. Capillaries are heat-sealed at one end over the flame of a burner (Figure 2A). The open end is then inserted into the chemoattractant solution (Figure 2B), of which the pH had been adjusted to that measured for the bacterial suspension (pH=7.0). As negative controls, capillaries are filled with chemotaxis buffer and for positive controls, capillaries are filled with a known, strong chemoattractant such, in the case of Pseudomonas strains, with 0.1 % of casamino acids. The closed end of the capillary is inserted into the rubber adaptor, which is then placed onto the wells in a way that the open end of the capillary is immersed into the bacterial suspension (Figure 2C).After incubation for 30 min, the capillaries are removed from the plate and the section of the capillary that was in contact with bacteria is rinsed with water.",
    "The sealed end of the capillary is broken and its contents emptied into a microfuge tube containing 1 ml of 0.9% (w/v) NaCl solution (Figure 2D) using a bulb dispenser. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160420/20160420022339_1287.jpgFigure 2. Experimental setup of capillary assays. A. One end of the capillary is sealed on open fire. B. Sealed and warmed capillary is inserted into the chemoattractant solution for filling. C. The rubber adaptor with the capillary is placed onto the well, which submerges the open end of capillary into the bacterial suspension that had been placed previously into the well. D. The capillary content is emptied into an Eppendorf tube containing 0.9% (w/v) NaCl.After a short centrifugation (5-10 sec), serial 10-fold dilutions of the resulting cell suspension are prepared in 0.9% (w/v) NaCl. For cell counting, a modified version of the protocol described in (Hoben and Somasegaran, 1982) is used. Agar plates containing LB medium (pH=7.4) supplemented with 17.5 µg/ml chloramphenicol are divided into six sectors, and three individual 20 µl aliquots are placed onto a plate sector as shown in Figure 3. Plates are incubated at 37 °C for 20-24 h prior to cell counting.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160420/20160420022424_9148.jpgFigure 3. LB agar plates containing chloramphenicol used for cell counting in the quantitative capillary chemotaxis assay. P. aeruginosa PAO1 colonies from the buffer control (left) and from chemotaxis towards 1 mM GABA (right). Shown are 10-fold dilutions and further dilutions are necessary to precisely quantify colonies of the GABA chemotaxis experiment.Part II. Gradient plate assaysIn this assay aliquots of chemoeffectors are deposited on an agar plate. After incubation permitting chemoeffector gradient formation, aliquots of the bacterial suspension are placed at a defined distance from the deposited chemoeffector. After approx. 1 day, plates are inspected.",
    "In the case of chemoattraction, the bacterial halo is acentric towards the chemoeffector, in the case of chemorepellation the halo is acentric away from the chemoeffector.Square petri dishes (120 mm x 120 mm) with vents are filled with 80 ml of Minimal A gradient plate medium (pH=7) (see Note 1). Plates are cooled at room temperature for at least 3 h. Care must be taken when moving the plates since the agar is semi-solid and can be damaged easily.Along the vertical central line of the plate, 10 μl aliquots of a concentrated chemoeffector solution (10 mM GABA in the case shown, see Note 2), dissolved in sterile water, are placed at regular distances (Figure 4). Plates are incubated for 12-16 h at 4 °C for gradient formation.Bacteria, in the case shown E. coli HD49, are grown overnight in TB medium supplemented with 17.5 µg/ml chloramphenicol at 30 °C.1 ml of the cell culture is then washed twice with 1 ml of 0.9 % (w/v) NaCl by consecutive centrifugation at 1,667 x g at 4 °C for 5 min and resuspension. The cell suspension is then diluted with 0.9% (w/v) NaCl to an OD600 of 0.4-0.6. Initially, 2 microliter aliquots of bacterial suspension are placed horizontally to each of the chemoattractant spots but with varying distances of 0.5-3.5 cm to the chemoeffector deposit (Figure 4). Plates are incubated at 30 °C for 16-30 h. The distance at which chemotaxis is seen best is then used for further analyses. Typically, cells can be deposited on either side of the attractant, which is a way to generate duplicate measurements or to assess taxis of different strains (wt and mutant strain) towards the same chemoeffector deposit.",
    "From these plates the magnitude of chemotaxis can be determined in a semi-quantitative manner by calculating the response index as described by (Pham and Parkinson, 2011). Briefly, the distances from the site of inoculation to the colony edges closest to (D1) and furthest from (D2) the chemoattractant source are determined to calculate the response index (RI) using RI = D1/(D1 + D2). RIs superior to 0.52 indicate chemotaxis, whereas RIs inferior to 0.48 represent chemorepellation. RI values between 0.48 and 0.52 indicate neutral behavior. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160420/20160420022458_2365.jpgFigure 4.
