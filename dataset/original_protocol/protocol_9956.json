    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC No. 17-0164-S1A0) of the Seoul National University Hospital.\n1. Scaffold Manufacturing\nNOTE: Two-layered esophageal scaffolds are manufactured by combining electrospinning and 3D printing. The inner membrane of the tubular scaffold was fabricated by electrospinning polyurethane (PU) with rotating stainless steel mandrels as the collectors9.\nFor the preparation of tubular PU nanofibers, prepare a 20% (w/v) solution of PU polymer by stirring in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) for 8 h at room temperature.\nPlace the PU solution on the syringe with a blunt metal needle (22 G), and electrospin on rotating stainless steel mandrels (diameter = 2 mm) at a distance of 30 cm between the needle tip and the rotating collector.\n\tNOTE: The power supply is set to a high-voltage direct current of 15 kV potential. The feeding rate of the solution is fixed at 0.5 mL/h using a syringe pump.\nMake a tubular nanofiber layer on the surface of the mandrel rotating at 3.14 m/s.\nDry the PU nanofiber in a vacuum oven at 40 °C overnight to completely remove residual solvent.\n\tNOTE: The 3D-printed outer wall of the esophageal scaffold is prepared using a rapid prototyping system. The 3D printing equipment consists of a dispenser, nozzle, compression/heat controller, 3-axis conversion stage, and software system.\nPCL pellets are dissolved at 100 °C in a heating cylinder and then printed on the surface of the nanofibers at high pressure (7 bar) under the control of a bioplotting system. The nozzle size is 300 µm and the strand distance is 700 µm.\nAfter removing the two-layered scaffold from the mandrel, sterilize by soaking in 70% ethanol under ultraviolet light.\n\tNOTE: More detailed characteristics of the scaffold have been reported in previous studies10.",
    "2. Cell Seeding on the Grafts and Bioreactor Cultivation\nNOTE: Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) purchased from a company were used without modification.\nPrior to cell transplantation, sterilize the 3D printed esophagus scaffold for 1 h under ultraviolet light, wet it for 10 min with ethanol, and wash it 3x with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nCulture and expand the hMSCs in growth medium (basal medium/growth supplement). Two-layered tubular scaffolds were transferred into nonadherent 24 well tissue culture plates.\nTo attach the cells to the inner surface of the scaffold, gently add the hMSC suspension at a density of 1 x 106 cells/mL in basement membrane matrix containing the growth medium.\nUniformly deposit the basement membrane matrix suspension on the inner surface of the two-layered tubular scaffold.\nFirmly fix the hMSC-seeded tubular scaffold to the acrylic holder in the culture chamber of the bioreactor using a pulsatile flow bioreactor system.\n\tNOTE: The custom-designed bioreactor system consists of a pump, bubble trap, flow chamber, pressure gauge, controllable valve, and medium reservoir. When applying shear stress in the culture chamber, allow a resting time of 1-2 min11.\nAdd growth medium to the culture chamber and apply 0.1 dyne/cm2 flow-induced shear stress under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO210.\n\tNOTE: The value of flow-induced shear stress was calculated by simulating the peristalsis of the esophageal tissue derived from the human body from previous studies10.\nDetermine the cell responses on the inner surfaces of the two-layered tubular scaffolds without bioreactor cultivation after 5 days using a LIVE/DEAD Viability Assay Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Obtain images via confocal microscopy using the Z-stack tool.\nOn the third day, observe surface morphology of the hMSC-seeded tubular scaffold through a scanning electron microscope (SEM).",
    "Fix the scaffold that was incubated with hMSC with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and OsO4 for 24 h and dehydrate with ethanol.\nCoat the fixed hMSCs with platinum using a sputter coater under argon atmospheric conditions and obtain SEM images at an accelerating voltage of 25 kV.\n3. Surgical Preparation for Animal Surgery\nNOTE: Surgical preparations are applied before both gastrostomy and esophageal transplantation.\nSet up the sterile surgical instruments: Scalpel blade, Weitlaner retractor, microneedle holder, microsuture forceps, microtissue forceps, microscissors, Mayo-Hegar needle holder, operating scissors, iris scissors, dressing forceps, tissue forceps, splinter forceps, iris forceps, 5 mL syringe (21 G needle), 10 mL syringe (22 G needle), 9-0 polyamide suture, 4-0 polyglactin suture.\nAnesthetize the animal with an intramuscular injection of tiletamine/zolazepam (50 mg/g dose) and 2% xylazine hydrochloride (2 mg/kg dose).\n\tNOTE: Adult Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats weighing 398-420 g were used for esophageal transplantation.\nBefore transferring to the surgical drape, check the appropriate anesthetic condition of the animal by pinching the tail with the forceps.\nPlace the animal in a supine position on the sterile drape and use clippers to remove the hair from the neck (for esophageal transplantation) or abdomen (for gastrostomy). Then scrub the surgical site with betadine and 70% ethanol.\nPrior to incision, subcutaneously inject an analgesic such as buprenorphine (0.05-0.1 mg/kg) for pain relief.\n4. Gastrostomy Surgery Using a T-tube in Rats\nNOTE: A modified gastrostomy was performed in all experimental animals to allow temporary bypass nonoral tube feeding (n = 5).\nHave rats fast the day before surgery. Prepare surgery as in section 3.\nExpose the stomach through a midline incision of the skin and abdominal muscles of the anesthetized rats.\nCreate a 3 mm orifice in the anterior gastric wall with a scalpel blade.",
    "Insert the tip of the silicone T-tube into the defect site to fix it to the stomach wall.\nSuture properly so that the T-tube does not detach from the gastric wall.\nTake out the distal end of the implanted T-tube through the subcutaneous tunnel into the back of the neck.\nInsert the heparin cap to the end of the T-tube to prevent the stomach contents from flowing backwards.\n\tNOTE: Use an angiocatheter to connect the end of the T-tube with the heparin cap.\nSuture all layers of the abdominal wall and skin using 4-0 polyglactin sutures.\nKeep all experimental rats separate in a metabolic cage after the gastrostomy has been completed.\n5. Esophageal Transplantation\nNOTE: The esophageal transplantation of the two-layered tubular scaffold is performed 1 week after the gastrostomy (n = 5). Prior to the transplantation, inoculate hMSCs (cell density: 1 x 106 cells/mL in basement membrane matrix) into the inner wall of each scaffold and incubate for 3 days in the bioreactor system. The surgical procedure is as follows.\nRemove the neck hair of the model animals and perform standard draping of the surgical site for aseptic surgery.\n\tNOTE: Create a large shaving area is recommended to maintain asceptic surgery on the animal.\nAfter anterior median incision of the neck, separate the strap muscles and expose the tracheoesophageal structure.\nBluntly dissect the vagus nerve from the esophagus before resecting the segment, otherwise the animal's breathing is compromised.\nUnder magnification, isolate the left side of the esophagus from the trachea and carefully separate the upper part from the thyroid gland.\nCreate a 5 mm long full circumferential defect containing all layers of the esophagus using surgical scissors.\n\tNOTE: Prior to esophageal transplantation, cut the prepared scaffolds using surgical scissors to match the length of the transplant site.",
    "Under a microscope, perform microanastomosis at both ends of the distal esophageal defect using a 9-0 suture thread. Place the first suture between the right inferoposterior margin of the upper esophagus remnant and scaffold. Continue suturing from right to left between the upper esophagus remnant and the scaffold. Anastomose the scaffold in the same manner as the upper margin of the lower esophagus remnant.\n\tNOTE: Perform microvascular anastomosis as used in clinical surgery for esophageal transplantation. Work with a microscope for precise, watertight suturing of the implant site.\nAfterwards, lay the surrounding thyroid gland flap over the transplanted site to ensure stable maintenance of and vascular supply to the grafts.\nAfter transplantation, stitch the subcutaneous muscle and skin tissue with a 4-0 vicryl suture.\nKeep all experimental rats individually in metabolic cages.\n6. Post-operative procedures\nNOTE: Postoperative procedures are performed after both gastrostomy and esophageal transplantation.\nAfter closure of the abdominal wound, put the rats into individual metabolic cages and place the cages on infrared warming devices to prevent hypothermia.\nMonitor the animals until they achieve and maintain sternal recumbency (i.e., lying upright on chest).\nTo minimize inflammation at the surgical site, administer the antibiotic gentamicin (20 mg/kg) daily to the rats.\nBegin oral liquid feeding on the third postoperative day until the endpoint of the study. Supply the whole nutrition formula (20.6 g/100 ml [g%] carbohydrate, 3.8 g% protein, 0.2 g% fat) through the heparin cap 3x per day beginning the day after surgery.\nCheck the animals' appearance and body weight daily. Check to manage behavior, such as self-harming incision site or resistance to the tube intake, as well as various surgical complications. When the body weight of the rat models decreases rapidly by 20% or more, perform euthanasia by CO2 inhalation.\n7. Histology and immunohistochemistry",
    "NOTE: For histological analysis, all of the esophageal tissue of the euthanized animals is extracted using surgical scissors. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and Masson's trichrome staining were performed using standard histological techniques. Immunohistochemistry was performed according to the following protocol.\nFix the whole esophagus containing the transplanted sites in 4% paraformaldehyde. Create a paraffin block and cut 4 µm thick sections.\nDeparaffinize the tissue sections and dehydrate them in an ethanol series. Immerse the tissue slides in citrate buffer and heat for 10 min in the microwave. Cool the cells with cold PBS for 20 min. Immerse in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 6 min, and wash with PBS for 10 min.\nIncubate in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature to block nonspecific reactions of tissue sections.\nWash 3x with PBS for 5 min. Incubate with primary antibodies against Desmin (diluted to 1:200), keratin 13 (diluted to 1:100), and von Willebrand Factor (vWF; diluted to 1:100) overnight at 4 °C.\nWash 3x with PBS for 15 min. Incubate with the appropriate secondary antibody at a concentration of 1:500 for Desmin and Keratin 13 at room temperature. Then, wash the slides twice with PBS for 10 min.\n\tNOTE: Tissue sections for vWF were incubated using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated kit (see Table of Materials) and then visualized using 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB).\nMount using a glass coverslip and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenolindole (DAPI) containing mounting medium.\nSubscription Required.
