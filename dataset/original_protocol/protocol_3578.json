    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCollection and preparation of mouse brain for ISH-tissue dissection, fixing, and cryoprotection\nTiming: 2 days\nThis step describes the protocol from dissecting mouse brain until it is fixed and ready for embedding. Keep the time between perfusion or sacrificing of the animal and fixation as short as possible, for best preservation of morphology.\nDay 1: Animal procedure. Place mouse in isoflurane chamber to anesthetize the animal.\nPrior to surgery, a ketamine/xylazine mixture dissolved in saline (up to 80 mg/kg body weight ketamine and 10 mg/kg body weight xylazine) is administered via intraperitoneal injection (27-gauge needle and 1 mL syringe).\nUse toe pinch response method to determine depth of anesthesia. Animal must be unresponsive before continuing.\nOnce the animal has reached a surgical plane of anesthesia, place mouse on its back on the shallow tray.\nMake a 5–6-cm lateral incision through the integument and abdominal wall just beneath the rib cage.\nContinue the diaphragm incision along the entire length of the rib cage to expose the pleural cavity.\nInsert the 30-gauge needle into the posterior end of the left ventricle, being careful to keep the tip of the needle in the lumen of the ventricle.\nFinally, make an incision to the animal's right atrium using iris scissors to create as large an outlet as possible without damaging the descending aorta. At this point the animal is ready to be perfused.\nPerfusion. Open and attach outlet port to needle base and pump up the manometer bulb to a pressure of 80 mm Hg.\nPerfuse with saline solution for 10 min.\nAfter 10 min, switch the stopcock to allow for flow of formalin solution, at same flow rate as saline.\nPerfuse with 4% PFA solution for 10–15 min.\nThe mouse should be stiff at this stage.",
    "Separate the mouse head with surgical scissors by making a cut posterior from the ears. Make a caudal midline incision in the skin and work rostrally to remove the skin from skull.\nStarting from the caudal part, cut through the top of the skull along midline and between the eyes with Iris scissors. Remove the parietal and frontal bone plates by tilting one side of a bone plate each time and snapping it off with tweezers.\nGently tilt the brain upward from the anterior part with tweezers and cut the optic nerves and other cranial nerves. Gently lift the brain out of the skull.\nRemove the brain and place it in a vial of fixative containing fluid at least 10× the volume of the brain itself. Swirl the vial occasionally.\nFix biopsies (3×3 mm) immediately in freshly prepared 4% (w/v) PFA/PBS for 12–18 h.\nCritical: When handling paraformaldehyde (PFA), both solid and aqueous, wear PPE and use a safety cabinet. Prepare formaldehyde solution by dissolving 4% (w/v) PFA into 1× phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution using heat (55°C). Filter the formaldehyde solution with filter paper.\nCritical: Proper fixation protocol followed by an appropriate tissue preparation form the basis for good histology (Montero, 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). The ideal fixative should preserve the antigens in the tissue in a form that is accessible and recognizable to the antibodies applied for the labeling technique.\nDay 2: Cryoprotection. Following fixation, keep the brain in 15% sucrose for 2–3 h and 30% sucrose for 12–18 h.\nBrain can be embedded for cryosectioning.\nCritical: This step is important for keeping the intact structure of the brain anatomy, including astrocytes morphology.\nPreparation of frozen tissue blocks/embedding and sectioning\nTiming: 2 days\nThis part describes the preparation of frozen tissue blocks for the mouse brain.",
    "Day 3: Label plastic molds for frozen block preparation with a permanent marker. It is necessary to make marks on the mold to indicate the orientation of the brain. Place a piece of clear tape over the labeling to prevent smearing. Place the molds on a flat surface, cover the bottom of the mold with the NEG50 or OCT freezing compound.\nPrechill acetone in a Petri dish placed on dry ice pellets. Keep this Petri dish on top of dry ice inside a Styrofoam box.\nCritical: Tissues should be frozen as rapidly as possible to avoid ice crystals. The method we prefer uses dry ice in pellet form. Work in a fume hood. Put a minimal amount of acetone into a petri dish so the bottom is covered. Carefully add a couple small dry ice pellets to the dish with acetone, leaving enough room for the mold. When the pellets stop bubbling vigorously, the \"slurry\" is ready. To maintain the temperature, you might have to add more dry ice pellets. Once you have filled the mold and oriented the tissue, place it in the cold acetone to freeze it.\nCritical: This step is important for keeping the intact structure of the brain anatomy, including astrocytes morphology.\nRemove the brain from the 30% sucrose solution. Use forceps to keep the brain in upright position. Hold a corner of the brain on a Kimwipe to release excess liquid and then place the brain on the empty dish on ice. Cut the bottom part of the brain to keep it level, if required.\nPlace the brain into molds filled with NEG50. Mix the brain gently with NEG50. Orient the brain as required for the most efficient sectioning. Cover the tissue with NEG50 and fill up the mold.",
    "Freeze quickly by placing the mold on petri dish with acetone on dry ice. Make sure the acetone only goes to the bottom quarter of the mold. Allow it to stand on dry ice until the block is fully white and solid. Dry the bottom of the mold with a paper towel. Wrap the mold with aluminum foil or parafilm and label it. Store at −20°C for short storage (5 days or less) or −80°C for long term storage.\nPause Point: Frozen blocks can be stored at −80°C for years. However, after freezing, the block should never be allowed to thaw. For transport, keep the blocks on dry ice.\nCryosectioning, fixation, and permeabilization of the sections\nTiming: 3 days, 1–2 h each day; 2 h incubation\nThis step describes how to section the frozen tissue and then fix and permeabilize the sections\nCryosectioning. Label the slides in order.\nSet up the cryostat (Equipment Setup) and clean the stage. Use a new blade for sectioning.\nCritical: Keep frozen blocks inside the cryostat. Do not let the blocks thaw or even soften. However, blocks stored at −80°C must be allowed to warm to −20°C prior to sectioning.\nCut 10–15 μm thick frozen sections. Note: The suggested cryostat temperature is between −15°C and −23°C. The section will curl if the specimen is too cold. If it is too warm, it will stick to the knife.\nThaw-mount the sections onto Superfrost-coated positive charged histological slides.\nDry the slides for approximately 10 min on a slide warmer at 37°C. Slides containing cryostat sections can be stored at −20°C to −-80°C for up to 12 months.",
    "Critical: The specimen preparation technique greatly contributes to the histochemical properties of the tissue and hence the excellence of the subsequent histology. In this study, cryosectioning performed well in respect to the detection of intracellular peptide antigen like GFAP. The penetration of the IHC staining into the cryostat sections is key to good staining. A number of requirements regarding section thickness, staining intensity, and penetration must be carefully tested (Wirenfeldt et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). In the present study, GFAP-positive cells visualized better at 12 μm section.\nNote: The drying time is important to properly mount the tissue sample onto the slide. Insufficient drying may cause section detachment. To avoid RNA degradation, the drying time should not exceed 10 min.\nFixation and Permeabilization of the Sections: day 1. When staining cryostat sections stored in a freezer, thaw the slides at 20°C–22°C for 10–20 min. Procedures from here can be done in a coplin jar or slide holder.\nPost-fix sections for 5 min with sterile 4% PFA in PBS.\nWash with sterile PBS, 2× 5 min each time.\nPermeabilize sections for 2 min with 1 μg/mL RNase-free Proteinase K in PBS.\nWash with PBS, 1 × 5 min.\nRe-fix sections for 5 min with 4% PFA in PBS.\nWash with PBS, 3× 5 min each time.\nIncubate sections with 70% EtOH for 5 min.\nFollowed with 95% EtOH for 2 min.\nAir dry in open humid chambers 5 min or until dry\nPrepare hybridization probe in Hybridization Solution in dry dock at 80°C for 3 min.\nNote: RNA probe is generated based on standard protocol from Promega.\nThe majority of probes work between dilutions of 1:400–1:1,000 in hybridization buffer. Using two dilutions is helpful if probe produces high background. https://www.promega.com/products/cloning-and-dna-markers/molecular-biology-enzymes-and-reagents/t3-rna-polymerase/?catNum=P2083[href=https://www.promega.com/products/cloning-and-dna-markers/molecular-biology-enzymes-and-reagents/t3-rna-polymerase/?catNum=P2083]",
    "Pipette 250–300 μL/slide of probe and place a parafilm coverslip over the sections. Place slides in humid chamber and incubate for 12–18 h at 65°C.\nDay 2: Turn on water baths 37°C and 65°C\nRemove coverslips from slides by immersing in 5× SSC. Use fine forceps if needed. Slides are now back in coplin jar.\nIn water bath at 65°C, wash sections with high-stringency wash for 30 min.\nIn water bath at 37°C, wash sections with RNase buffer for 3 × 10 min each time\nTo digest any single-stranded (unbound) RNA probe, incubate sections for 30 min at 37°C in RNase Buffer containing 20 μg/mL RNase A.\nIn water bath at 37°C, wash sections with RNase buffer for 15 min.\nIn water bath at 65°C, high-stringency wash sections for 2 × 20 min.\nIn water bath at 37°C, wash sections in 2× SSC for 15 min.\nIn water bath at 37°C, wash sections with 0.1× SSC for 15 min.\nWash the sections with PBT (PBS + 0.1% Tween 20) at 20°C–22°C for 15 min.\nCover slides for 120 min with 250–300 μL/slide blocking solution (10% NGS in PBT with 0.5 mg/mL Levamisol) in humid chamber.\nWash the slides with PBT at 20°C–22°C 4 × 5 min each time.\nCover the slides with 250–300 μL/slide anti-DIG antibody 1:2,500 with10% NGS in PBT in a humid chamber at 4°C for 12–18 h.\nDay 3: Decant anti-DIG antibody and wash the slides in coplin jar with PBT 6 × over 5 h.\nWash sections with NTMT buffer 2 × 10 min each time.\nCover each sample slide with approximately 300 μL of BM-Purple exposure solution for 30 min to 16 h in a dark humid chamber until desired color has developed.",
    "When color development is optimal (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]), stop the color reaction by incubating the slides in PBS 2 × 5 min each time.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/501-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Example of combined IHC-in situ hybridization staining\nCombined IHC-in situ hybridization protocol shows expression of (A) LCN2 (lipocalin 2) and (B) C3 (complement C3) in astrocytes\nAMPK KO mouse astrocytes labeled with GFAP antibodies and hybridized with the RNA probes set for LCN2 and C3 shown in blue. Insets show magnifications of co-localization of LCN2 or C3 with GFAP. Scale bars, 50 μm.\nSlides can be moved to IHC steps now\nImmunohistochemistry\nTiming: 2 days\nWash sections in PBS for 5 min.\nWash with 0.3% H2O2 in PBS to inhibit endogenous peroxidase activity for 10 min at 20°C–22°C\nWash sections in PBS for 3 × 5 min each time.\nDry back of slide with tissue paper and add ∼325 μL anti-GFAP antibody (1:1,000) in blocking buffer and incubate for 12–18 h in humid chamber at 20°C–22°C.\nCritical: Antibody concentration needs to be optimized, as its critical for the success in GFAP staining. We systematically tested different GFAP antibodies and concentrations. In our hands, the staining result and the morphology of GFAP-positive cells visualized in this study are consistent with the original description of astrocytes.\nDay 4: Wash sections in PBS for 3 × 5 min each time.\nAdd ∼325 μL biotinylated secondary antibody (1:500) in blocking buffer and incubate 2 h in humid chamber.\nWash sections in PBS for 3 × 5 min each time.\nIncubated the sections in avidin and biotinylated horseradish peroxidase macromolecular complex (ABC reagent), 10 μL/mL each of reagents A and B and 10% Triton X-100 in 1 mL PBS for 1 h.\nWash sections in PBS for 3 × 5 min each time.",
    "Add ∼300 μL DAB per slide. Carefully observe the color development through a microscope and stop the reaction when the desired color obtained. DAB prepared according to the manufacturer’s directions. https://vectorlabs.com/dab-peroxidase-hrp-substrate.html[href=https://vectorlabs.com/dab-peroxidase-hrp-substrate.html]\nWash sections in PBS for 3 × 5 min each time.\nMount slides with appropriately sized coverslip and Vectashield antifade mounting medium\nNote: Any standardized protocol for imaging can be used. We image with a Leica light microscope DM2500 with a Lecia DMC6200 camera and perform image acquisition and processing in the Leica Acquisition Software (LASX) suite. All imaging data are analyzed by Image J.\nQuantification of the GFAP-positive astrocytes\nAssessing astrocyte structure and morphology requires complementary approaches to assess varying levels of detail. Currently, there are multiple tools available to analyze and quantify the extremely complex astrocyte morphology (Parekh and Ascoli, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]) (Kulkarni et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). The choice between options is normally based upon both the level of detail needed to answer the scientific question and the resources that are available. Reproducible visualization of astrocytes in brain is essential for quantitative studies of the cellular changes in CNS diseases. Lyck et al describe a detailed procedure to identify antibodies and protocols that could preserve and visualize astrocytes and neurons for quantitative stereological studies (Lyck et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Another reliable protocol is to perform intracellular iontophoresis of astrocytes using fluorescent Lucifer yellow dye in lightly fixed brain tissue from adult mice (Moye et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). More recently, a method utilizes a genetically encoded membrane associated fluorescent marker of astrocytes, called lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck), which is tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP)(Testen et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).",
    "For the quantitative evaluation in this study, we identified astrocytes as typical gray matter bushy cells with numerous short and ramified processes; fibrous astrocytes were typical white matter star-shaped cells with long, thin, and relatively non-ramified processes. We only considered reactive astrocytes as LCN2 or C3 positive cells that co-stained with GFAP and exhibited a clear soma with minimum overlapping branches in the fields.\nTo calculate astrocyte density, we selected three consecutive visual fields under 20× objective. We counted the number of astrocytes using Image J Cell Counter plugin."
