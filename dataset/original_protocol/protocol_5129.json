    "Design of guide RNA (gRNA) constructs for the target gene of interestInsert the genomic sequence coding for the C-terminal region of the protein of interest in a guide design tool of choice (e.g., crispr.mit.edu[href=http://crispr.mit.edu/]). In most cases, an input sequence with a total length of 250 nucleotides surrounding the stop codon harbors enough PAM motifs for the design tool to generate multiple guide sequences. Select guides in close proximity of the C-terminus. Bear in mind potential off-target effects when defining the guides. Most design tools provide this information directly by ranking potential guides based on off-target hit-scores in the target genome.Clone guides in a Cas9 expression vector of choice. Use of the Cas9 D10A nickase mutant (nCas9, Addgene plasmids #48140 and #62987) is advised to minimize off-target cleavage events. Alternatively, wild-type Cas9 expression vectors are also available on Addgene (plasmids #48138 and #62988). Detailed cloning procedures for the constructs are described by Ran et al. (2013). When using the Cas9 D10A nickase (nCas9) maintain a minimal offset between the guide pairs to ensure optimal efficiency.Note: It is recommended to assess the cleavage efficiency of multiple gRNAs in a separate experiment. This can be done by transfecting the constructs and performing a mismatch cleavage assay (e.g., Surveyor mismatch cleavage assay) on the selected cell population (Qiu et al., 2004). We usually test 2-3 different gRNAs for each genomic region of interest. In case of using nCas9 it is recommended to test 2-3 pairs of gRNAs.Generation of the rAAV targeting construct by PCR amplification of homology regionsA backbone plasmid for C-terminal tagging with a combinatorial tag consisting of the PQS1 peptide (Vandemoortele et al., 2004) and a 3xFlag tag has been deposited in Addgene (plasmid #84883).",
    "An alternative version of this targeting construct containing the PQS2 peptide and a 3xHA-tag is also available on Addgene (plasmid #84917). 5’ and 3’ homology regions (HRs) can be inserted in multiple cloning sites present in these plasmids via standard cloning procedures. Prepare genomic DNA (gDNA) using a phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation protocolDetach and pellet 2.5 x 106 cells corresponding to a subconfluent T25 flask in an Eppendorf tube by centrifugation at 500 x g for 5 min at room temperature (RT).Add 500 µl gDNA Phase Lock lysis buffer (see Recipes) to the pellet and incubate overnight at 37 °C.Prior to adding the lysate, spin down the Phase Lock tubes by short centrifugation. Shake the lysate samples well before transferring to the Phase Lock tube. Add 500 µl phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v) and shake vigorously for 1 min.Centrifuge Phase Lock tube for 3 min at 16,000 x g at RT. Transfer aqueous phase into a fresh Eppendorf tube and add 50 µl 3 M NaCl and 500 µl 2-propanol. The genomic DNA can be observed after inverting the tubes several times.Centrifuge for 2 min at 16,000 x g at RT. Discard supernatant and add 1 ml 70% ethanol to the DNA pellet. Invert several times and incubate for 5 min at RT. Centrifuge for 2 min at 16,000 x g at RT.Discard supernatant. Air dry the pellet at 52 °C for 5 min prior to re-suspending the pellet in 100 µl 10 mM TE-buffer pH 7.5. Allow pellet to dissolve for 1 h by incubating at 65 °C in a thermoshaker. Measure genomic DNA concentration.Design primers to amplify the HRs with appropriate overhanging restriction sites for insertion in the backbone plasmid. Note: It is recommended to use HRs of at least 650 bp.",
    "Shorter HRs are reported to substantially reduce homologous recombination potential (Vasileva et al., 2006). Targeting constructs exceeding 4.7 kb in total length between inverted terminal repeat (ITR) sequences will hamper packaging efficiency of rAAV (Wu et al., 2010). Prepare PCR mixtable:",

Alternative cloning methods (e.g., Gibson assembly, In-Fusion) are also compatible with these vectors.rAAV production and purificationAAV-293 transfectionSeed 10 T75 flasks with 4 x 106 AAV-293 cells 24 h before transfection.Aspirate and add fresh growth medium at least 30 min prior to transfection.Prepare DNA transfection mix for every T75.table:\n﻿0,1\npAAV targeting construct (1 µg/µl),15 µl\npDG (1 µg/µl),30 µl\n2.5 M CaCl2,75 µl\nddH2O,630 µl",
    "Note: The pDG plasmid serves as a helper plasmid for rAAV packaging. pDG contains all the required AAV and adenoviral functions to ensure amplification and packaging of (r)AAV vectors.Add DNA transfection mix dropwise to 750 µl 2x HEBS (see Recipes) while using a vortex to ensure thorough mixing. Incubate mixture for 10 min at RT.Transfer transfection mix to cells in a dropwise fashion.Note: Transfected AAV-293 cells and purified rAAV virus should be handled in a BSL-2 facility from this point onwards.Replace growth medium with 12 ml of fresh DMEM growth medium 24 h after transfection and incubate for an additional 48 h.Note: Before replacing the growth medium a fine precipitate should be found between the transfected cells by visual inspection using a light microscope. The calcium-phosphate-DNA precipitate aids binding of the DNA to the cell surface before entering the cells by endocytosis. Suboptimal transfection buffers (e.g., 2x HEBS) or DNA qualities can affect precipitate formation leading to low transfection efficiencies. Growth impairment may occur due to transfection.  Harvest and purification of rAAV particlesCollect growth medium with detached cells in 50 ml tubes.Note: Cells may detach during rAAV production. The total amount of growth medium of all T75 Falcons used for production is equally divided over 4 50 ml tubes for convenience in further steps of the purification procedure. Collect cells in 1.5 ml PBS/T75 flask using a cell scraper and add cell suspensions to the 50 ml tubes. Centrifuge the cells for 3 min at 500 x g and transfer the supernatants to new 50 ml tubes.Add 2.5 ml PBS to the obtained cell pellets, re-suspend the cell pellets and combine all cell suspensions in one new tube. Centrifuge for 3 min at 500 x g and re-suspend the cell pellet in 3 ml rAAV lysis buffer.",
    "Subject pellets to 3 freeze-thaw cycles with brief vortexing between cycles. Transfer the lysate to the supernatant of step C2b. Note: Unpurified virus can be stored at -80 °C. Tubes should be thawed prior to purification using a 37 °C water bath while swirling the tube to maintain low temperature.Centrifuge the tubes at 900 x g for 30 min at 4 °C. Collect supernatant in a 250 ml sterile bottle and add Benzonase nuclease (final conc. 50 U/ml).Purify rAAV particles using the VIRAPUR AAV Purification Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Purified virus should be stored in aliquots at -80 °C until use. Transfection and infection of HCT116 cellsSeed 2.7 x 105 HCT116 cells/well in a 24-well plate containing 1 ml McCoys growth medium.Prepare following mixes in separate tubes.table:",

    "Gently add the Fugene HD mix to the DNA mix, tap the tube gently and incubate the mixture for 10 min at RT. During this incubation step, replace the medium on the HCT116 cells with 250 µl Opti-MEM.Note: McCoys growth medium is replaced by Opti-MEM during transfection since cytotoxicity of Fugene-based transfections can increase due to the presence of antibiotics in the growth medium (e.g., penicillin and streptomycin).Add the Fugene HD-DNA mix dropwise to the HCT116 cells. Add 250 µl additional McCoys medium containing 20% FBS to the cells 6 to 8 h after transfection. Detach cells with trypsin 24 h post transfection. Transfer half of the cell suspension to a T25 flask. The remainder of the cells can be either discarded or used as non-infected G418 control population described in step D7.Dilute 50 µl of rAAV virus in 1 ml McCoys growth medium and add the mixture to the transfected cells 24 h after seeding in T25 flasks. Note: If colony numbers are markedly lower than expected (Figure 2), infection volumes can be increased to 150 µl or even 500 µl. Selection of cells transfected with CRISPR-Cas9 plasmids by the Zhang lab (see Materials) using puromycin or EGFP-based cell sorting prior to infection is optional. In most experiments, it is sufficient to solely rely on Geneticin/G418 selection for enrichment as this is a direct indicator of rAAV cassette insertion in the target genome. Moreover, treatment of the cells with puromycin or FACS sorting before G418 selection may have a detrimental effect on survival. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170327/20170327231037_9313.jpgFigure 2. Crystal violet staining of rAAV-infected (left) and non-infected HCT116 cells (right) after 14 days of G418 selection. The crystal violet stain visualizes cell foci resistant to G418.Add G418 to the cells at a concentration of 1 mg/ml 72 h after transfection.",
    "Note: An additional infected HCT116 population and non-infected HCT116 population is subjected to G418 selection to assess infection efficiency by crystal violet staining of the G418-resistant cell foci or colonies. The expected staining outcome is shown in Figure 2.Split cells and add fresh G418-supplemented growth medium when culture reaches 70% confluency. After 14 days of selection, seed single HCT116 cells in 96-well plates by manual dilution. Maintain 1 mg/ml G418 selection in the 96-well plates.Note: In a typical manual dilution step the cells are detached, counted and diluted to 10, 20 and 40 cells/ml. For each density (1, 2 or 4 cells/well) one plate is seeded by pipetting 100 µl of diluted cell suspension in each well of a 96-well tissue culture plate prefilled with 100 µl growth medium. It is recommended to seed different densities to ensure sufficient wells with single cells. Screen every well for presence of clonal cell populations one week after seeding by visual inspection using light microscopy.Once the majority of clonal populations reach approximately 70% confluence (Figure 3) PCR screening of the clonal cell populations can start (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170327/20170327231117_7463.jpgFigure 3. Typical view of an HCT116 clonal population. Once most identified populations reach 70% confluence PCR-based screening can be started. Left: expanding colony; right: colony ready for screening. Scale bars = 100 µm.PCR-based screening for homology-directed repair eventsThe different primers used for PCR screening are depicted in Figure 4. It is recommended to design HR screening PCR reactions containing the junction of the HR with the flanking genomic DNA sequence in order to avoid the detection of random integration events (false positives). Random integration events can be detected by Southern blotting (step G2 and Data analysis section).   imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170327/20170327231220_2028.jpgFigure 4. rAAV-mediated homology-directed repair of CRISPR-induced double stranded breaks on a single allele.",
