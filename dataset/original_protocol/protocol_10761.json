    "This study was performed according to the international, national and institutional rules considering animal experiments. The study protocol was approved by the animal ethics committee of Nankai University.\n1. MPTP and L-DOPA administration\nNOTE: Ten-week-old female BALB/c mice were provided by the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Mice were housed six per cage under a 12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 08:00-20:00), a constant temperature of 21-22 °C and a relative humidity of 55% ± 5%. Autoclaved standard mice chow of the same formulation and water ad libitum was given to all animals.\nAfter one week of acclimatization, divide the animals into three groups of six mice each.\nTo Group 1, administer intraperitoneal injections (see step 1.5) of 250 µL/mouse/day of saline from day 1 to day 7 and then perform intragastric administration (see step 1.6) of 250 µL/mouse of saline on day 8.\nTo Group 2, administer intraperitoneal injections of 20 mg/kg/day of MPTP every day from day 1 to day 7 and then perform intragastric administration of 250 µL/mouse of saline on day 8.\nTo Group 3, administer intraperitoneal injections of 20 mg/kg/day of MPTP from day 1 to day 7 and then perform intragastric administration of 5 mg/kg of L-DOPA on day 8.\nPerform the intraperitoneal injection as follows.\n\t\nLoad the drug into a sterile 1 mL syringe with a 26 G needle. Eliminate air from the syringe.\nScruff the mouse with its belly facing up. Keep the head, neck and body of the mouse in a straight line as well with the head fixed.\nAngle the needle to penetrate the peritoneum. Push the needle for a proper distance until there is little resistance, and then inject the drug. Pull out the needle smoothly.\nPerform the intragastric administration as follows.",
    "Prepare the medication in a sterile 1 mL syringe with an oral-gavage needle. Eliminate air from the syringe.\nHold the mouse with its belly facing up. Keep the head, neck and body of the mouse in a straight line with the head fixed.\nKeep the needle parallel to the body of the mouse, and insert it from the corner of the mouse's mouth, pressing the tongue and pushing inward against the upper jaw.\nWith little resistance, which shows the needle is entering the esophagus smoothly, carefully push the needle in a proper distance. Before the tip of the needle reaches the bottom part of chest, inject the medication.\nPull out the needle smoothly.\n2. Cylinder test\nNOTE: The behavioral tests were performed on day 8. L-DOPA was injected to the third group of mice 40 min before the behavioral tests. If the behavioral testing is not done in the same room where the animals are housed, animals need to be acclimated to the new room for 30-60 min before test.\nPerform the test 24 h after the last dose of MPTP.\nPlace a transparent glass cylinder (height = 19.5 cm, diameter = 15 cm, weight ≥1 kg) at the center of a table. Surround the cylinder on three sides with black cardboard to reduce the effect of environmental lighting. Leave one side of the cylinder facing the camera for video recording.\n\tNOTE: The distance between the cardboard and cylinder should be about 4 to 8 cm.\nAttach a camera (> 1 million-pixel resolution) at ~40-60 cm away from the cylinder to ensure that the full cylinder is visible.\n\tNOTE: This is neither too near nor too far so as to not disturb the mouse while recording the video of its movement.",
    "Place one mouse into the cylinder at a time and start filming at once. Stop filming after 3 min.\n\tNOTE: During this process, try to avoid noise or light changes in order avoid influencing the mouse’s behavior.\nPlace the mouse back into the home cage after testing.\nClean the cylinder with water and then spray 70% v/v ethanol over the inner wall to sanitize it and remove mouse scents. Wipe the cylinder dry before another mouse is placed into.\nPlay back the video at a rate of 0.5x the regular speed and count the number of paw lifts against the wall of each mouse.\n\tNOTE: Paw lifts occur when the mouse rears up on its hindlimbs, raises both forelimbs above shoulder level and lands. One forelimb lift is NOT counted. Usually, a mouse raises its forelimbs to touch the cylinder walls. If the mouse raises its forelimbs above shoulder level several times continuously without landing, it should be counted only as once.\n3. Open field test\nPerform the open field test 24 h after MPTP dosing.\n\tNOTE: It can be carried out at the same time of the cylinder test.\nPrepare a transparent open field reaction box (45 cm L x 45 cm W x 25 cm H) with a wooden plate cover at the bottom by a black cloth. Fix a camera (> 1 million-pixel resolution) over the field at a height of 1 m.\n\tNOTE: The color of open field box bottom should be different from the tested mouse color to ensure color contrast in the video.\nAdjust the camera to make sure that the open field reaction box is right in the center of the video.\nPut one test mouse into the box, and let the mouse familiarize itself with the environment for about 1 min.",
    "Record a 5 min video using the camera connected to the computer.\nAnalyze the video using software tools (e.g., MATLAB) to get the movement trace figure, the distribution of static (velocity <1 cm/s), walking (velocity 1-20 cm/s) and running (velocity >20 cm/s) time, the total traveled distance, and average speed of each tested mouse.\n\tNOTE: When analyzing the video, we track the whole body of the mouse. The average speed of a body means the total length of path covered, divided by the elapsed time. Therefore, if a mouse is not moving, its instantaneous velocity would be considered as zero.\nClean up any feces in the open field reaction box. Spray 70% ethanol on the box and wipe it.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
