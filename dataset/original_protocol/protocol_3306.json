    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTumor and blood storage\nTiming: 5 min\nIf tumor and/or blood samples are collected late and digestion cannot be performed the same day, the tumor can be stored overnight in MACS Tissue Storage Solution (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat# 130-100-008) at 4°C and the blood at 20°C–25°C.\nTumor dissociation\nTiming: 2 h\nHere we describe the best practices for dissociating a tumor sample and obtaining a tumor cell suspension that can be analyzed by flow cytometry.\nBring the RPMI to 20°C–25°C 30 min before starting the manipulation.\nRemove the digestive enzymes from the freezer so that they have time to thaw.\nRemove the tumor sample from the Tissue Storage Solution.\nPlace it in a sterile petri dish under a microbiology safety cabinet (MSC) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3073-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Digestion and preparation of cell suspension from colorectal cancer\n(A and B) Mechanical digestion of the colorectal tumor: The tumor is cut into the smallest possible fragments with scissors.\n(C) Transfer of tumor fragments into the C-tube and addition of digestion enzymes.\n(D and E) Mechanical and enzymatic digestion of tumor fragments: the C Tube is placed on the Gentle Macs with the heater and the 37C_h_TDK1 program is started. The movement of the C Tube helix will enable mechanical digestion, and thanks to the heater, the digestion enzymes will be at the optimal temperature to perform enzymatic digestion.\n(F) Filtration of the cell suspension on a 70 μm SmartStrainer filter to remove aggregates.\nCritical: It is critical to separate tumor samples larger than 2 g into two tubes for optimal digestion.\nAdd 1.7 mL of RPMI.\nUsing a scissors and/or scalpel, cut the tumor into small pieces of not exceeding 2 mm in width (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).",
    "Critical: It is critical to cut the tumor into pieces that are as small as possible for optimal digestion (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nTransfer the whole set (medium + tumor pieces) into a C-tube (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nRinse the petri dish with 3 mL of RPMI (or 500 μL of RPMI if tumor weight is less than 0.2 g, see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] below) and transfer it to the C-tube.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3073_1.csv\nAfter vortexing the C-tube well, add the enzymes previously reconstituted from the Human Tumor Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat# 130-095-823) to the C-tube in the following amounts.\nCritical: Dissociation enzyme mix has to be prepared at the last moment and cannot be stored.\nVortex the C-tube again and place it on the Gentle Macs.\nAdd a heater on the C-tube (allowing the dissociation at 37°C) (Yellow addition on top of the C-tube in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nSelect the program “37C_h_TDK_1\" on the Gentle Macs and start the enzymatic and mechanical digestion of the tumor (the program takes about 1 h) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nWhen digestion is complete, place a 70 μm SmartStrainer on a 50 mL tube and filter the tumor suspension (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F). The digested tumor solution should be cloudy at the end of digestion. Depending on the weight of the tumor and its composition, small tissue clumps may remain after the hour of digestion.\nAdd 20 mL of RPMI to the C-tube, and rinse properly by closing the tube and inverting it.\nRinse the filter with the 20 mL and if necessary, use a 1 mL syringe plunger to gently pass the sample through the filter.\nCentrifuge the suspension at 300 g for 7 min at 20°C–25°C.\nCarefully remove the supernatant with a pipette and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of RPMI.",
    "Perform a cell count on a Kova Slide using trypan blue to assess cell viability (the dilution is to be adapted according to the cell pellet, generally dilution to the 20th or 100th).\nNote: Viability is usually around 90%.\nResuspend the cells at 107 cells/mL.\nPlace 106 cells (i.e., 100 μL of the cell suspension) in a 5 mL tube with cap.\nTumor infiltrating leukocyte (TIL) pre-staining\nTiming: 30 min\nThis section describes the pre-labeling of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes from the tumor cell suspension.\nAdd 1.25 μL (62.5 ng per test, dilute 1:80) of Brilliant Violet 785 anti-human CD45 antibody (Cat# 304048, BioLegend) to the 5 mL tube, which contains 106 cells in 100 μL (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3073-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Pre-labeling of tumor-infiltrating T cells with Brilliant Violet 785 anti-human CD45 antibody\nVortex gently and incubate for 15 min at 20°C–25°C in the dark.\nWash the cells with 2 mL of RPMI and centrifuge at 300 g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and repeat Step 23.\nCell activation and immunostaining\nTiming: 5 h\nIn this section, we describe the different steps involved in non-specific activation of blood and tumor, and in labeling to study T cell secretory capacity.\nNext, resuspend the cells in 50 μL of the patient’s heparinized whole blood (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3073-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Cell activation\n(A) Re-pelleting of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes labeled with anti-human CD45 antibody with 50 μL of blood.\n(B) Transfer of blood containing TILs into a DURActive 1 tube before incubation for 3 h at 37°C in the dark.\nTransfer the 50 μL into a DURActive 1 tube (Cat# C11101, Beckman Coulter) containing PMA, ionomycin and brefeldin A (to enable non-specific activation and blocking of secretory vesicles) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).",
    "Vortex for 15 s and incubate for 3 h at 37°C in the dark.\nAt the end of the activation, add 25 μL of R1 fixator from PerFix-nc kit (Beckman Coulter, Cat# B31167) and vortex immediately for 15 s (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3073-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Cell fixation\n(A) The fixative solution is added directly to the tube of activated cells.\n(B) The tube is immediately vortexed for 15 s.\nIncubate for 15 min at 20°C–25°C in the dark.\nAdd 2 mL of 1X PBS and mix by turning the tube and gently vortexing.\nCentrifuge the tube for 5 min at 150 g at 20°C–25°C.\nWhile the cells are in the centrifuge, add the liquid antibodies to the DURAClone tube (Beckman Coulter) (see Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] below):\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3073_2.csv\n2.5 μL of Brilliant Violet 650 anti-human IL-2 Antibody (BioLegend, Cat# 500334).\n5 μL of PE-Cyanine5.5 anti-human granzyme B Antibody (Thermo Fisher, Cat# GRB18).\nNote: To use this panel, you must ensure that your flow cytometry equipment has an optical configuration compatible with this panel.\nAt the end of centrifugation, discard the supernatant and resuspend cells in 25 μL of inactivated FBS, adding the 25 μL on a vortex to enable all the cells to resuspend in the FBS (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A–5C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3073-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Cell permeabilization and labeling with intracellular antibodies\n(A and B) After centrifugation, the supernatant is very carefully removed by inverting because the pellet is very slippery.\n(C) The pellet is vortexed while adding FBS to the cells.\n(D) The cells are resuspended in the R2 to be permeabilized and then transferred to the antibody tube.\nCritical: Be very careful when removing the supernatant by inversion because the pellet may slip due to the presence of red blood cells (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).",
    "Add 300 μL of R2 permeabilizer from PerFix-nc kit (Beckman Coulter, Cat# B31167) to the cells and transfer the whole suspension to the DURAClone tube containing the liquid antibodies prepared in step 32 (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D).\nNote: A non-specific binding blocker such as FcR Block can be added at this stage.\nVortex for 15 s and incubate for 1 h in the dark at 20°C–25°C.\nStop the reaction by adding 3 mL of 1X PBS to the cells and incubate for 5 min in the dark at 20°C–25°C (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3073-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Stabilization of the reaction\n(A) Solution R3 is added to stabilize the reaction.\n(B and C) The supernatant is removed by turning it over and tapping lightly on a paper towel.\n(D) Labeled cells are collected in 150 μL of R3 and well homogenized before being moved to the cytometer.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 500 g at 20°C–25°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend cells in 3 mL of 1X R3 stabilizer from PerFix-nc kit (Beckman Coulter, Cat# B31167) (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B and 6C).\nCentrifuge again for 5 min at 500 g at 20°C–25°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend cells in 150 μL of 1X R3 (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D).\nAcquisition on the flow cytometer\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section details the acquisition of cellular fractions on the DxFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) using CytExpert software.\nPrepare unstained and single-stained controls for each fluorochrome used in your panel. We recommend the use of compensation beads for the single-stained controls.\nFrom the VersaComp Antibody Capture Kit (Cat# B22804, Beckman Coulter), add one drop of positive beads and one drop of negative beads to each test tube (one test tube per antibody).\nAdd the antibody you want to test at the concentration used in the panel and vortex immediately.",
    "Incubate for 20 min in the dark at 20°C–25°C.\nAdd 2 mL of PBS 1X to the tube and centrifuge the beads at 300 g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the beads in 500 μL of PBS 1X.\nOnce the controls for the compensations are done, you can go to the flow cytometer and create a new experiment.\nUse the unstained and single-stained beads to define the appropriate APD gain or PMT voltage and prepare the compensation matrix.\nCreate the gating strategy as shown in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3073-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Flow cytometric analysis of the functionality of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and blood T cells from a patient with a colorectal tumor\nAfter doublet cell exclusion, the lymphoid cells were selected by their morphological aspect. The TILs are defined as CD3+ CD45+ and the blood lymphoid cells as CD3+ CD45-. In these two populations, it is then possible to distinguish CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, then to differentiate regulatory T cells (CD4+ or CD8+ FoxP3+) and conventional T cells (CD4+ or CD8+ FoxP3-). Finally, we analyzed within the conventional T cells each of the following subpopulations: T helper (Th) 1 (CD4+ IFNg+ IL17-), Th 17 (CD4+ IFNγ- IL17+), Th1/17 (CD4+ IFNγ+ IL17+), Th2 (CD4+ IFNγ- IL17- IL4+), T cytotoxic (Tc) 1 (CD8+ IFNγ+ IL17-), Tc 17 (CD8+ IFNγ- IL17+), Tc1/17 (CD8+ IFNγ+ IL17+), Tc2 (CD8+ IFNγ- IL17- IL4+). It is also possible to look at the cytokine production of each of the different populations visualized previously (here for example, we look at IFNγ, TNF-α, Granzyme B and IL-2 on conventional CD4+ T cells).\nLoad and record all your samples.",
    "Pause point: If tumor and/or blood samples are collected late in the day and digestion cannot be done the same day, they can be stored following the “tumor and blood storage” part conditions.\nPause point: If the protocol has been started, it can be stopped at Step 33. Cells can be stored overnight at 4°C after adding 25 μL of FBS (step 33. in “cell activation and immunostaining” part). The next morning, the protocol can be resumed directly at Step 34."
