    "This protocol has been generated for a prospective clinical trial and co-clinical research. The study was compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and approved by the Stanford University institutional review board (IRB). All patients or their legally authorized representative signed a written informed consent, and all children between 7 and 18 years of age signed an assent form.\n1. Installing and starting the T2 Fit Map plugin\nStart the Osirix software. Install the T2 Fit Map plugin from the plugin manager and restart the software.\n\t\nOn the menu bar, click the Plugins button. Click on the drop-down menu and select Install a plugin package (Figure 1).\nOnce the plugin manager is loaded, select the available plugins from the drop-down menu and then T2 Fit Map (Figure 2).\nClick download & install. Close the plugin manager and restart the software.\nLoad the multi-echo gradient echo sequence images as DICOM files into the software.\nChange the mouse button function to draw a Region of Interest (ROI) (Figure 3).\nUsing this mouse button function, define a shape for the required ROI: select Oval or Closed Polygon, or the desired shape from the drop-down menu (Figure 4).\nDraw ROIs in the required images with different echo times (TEs).\nSelect the ROIs in all the images with different TEs for which the T2* map is required.\nClick the Plugins button, select Image filters from the drop-down menu, and then select T2 Fit Map.\nClick on T2 Fit Map. A dialog box will open; click on Generate Map (which is located at the bottom of the dialog box) (Figure 5).",
    "NOTE: A fitting curve is generated with minimum, mean, and maximum T2* values for the selected ROIs with various TEs (ms). The mean T2* value is calculated and displayed below the curve (Figure 6).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64773/64773fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Selecting 'Install a plugin package' from the drop-down menu.

Exclusion of noise using the definition of mask\nNOTE: To define a mask on the first echo of the T2map_MSME data used to calculate the parametric maps, set a lower first-echo signal threshold for T2* value calculation (the T2* map volume will now exclude the pixels with signals too low for accurate calculation at the first multi-spin multi-echo (MSME) echo. The threshold can be increased to exclude more pixels, or decreased to include more pixels).\nTo define the mask ROI on an image series outside the parametric data, open the desired series (e.g., first echo of the T2map_MSME with TE = 15) and select a slice.",
    "At bottom of the ROI drop-down menu, select Grow Region….\nSelect the 3D Growing Region… radio button (Figure 7).\nIn the Algorithm drop-down menu, select Threshold (lower/upper bounds).\nSet the lower and upper thresholds to 0 and X% of the contralateral calf muscle signal, respectively (e.g., set the threshold to the value that will mask out the most speckle in the tumor ROI and will leave the most evaluable tumor T2(*)s).\nSet the ROI name as desired.\nClick on the image to place a seed for ROI growing.\nClick the Compute button.\nIn the ROI menu, select Save All ROIs of this Series… (Figure 8).\n\tNOTE: Now, the ROI defining the area to mask out of the parametric maps has been saved and can be applied to the parametric data.\nOpen the Parametric dataset in the 4D viewer.\nIn the ROI menu, select Import ROI(s)....\n\tNOTE: The mask ROI is now in the first parametric series.\nCheck that the ROIs are in the first 3D volume and not 4D.\nApply mask to map the data. To do so, at the bottom of the ROI drop-down menu, select Set Pixel Values To. Then, select apply to: ROIs with same name… (Figure 9).\nCheck the Propagate to 4D series box.\nSet pixels that are Inside ROIs.\nSet To this new value: as 0.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64773/64773fig07.jpg\nFigure 7: Screenshot showing the segmentation parameters.
