    "Precautions: RNA is very sensitive and easily degraded by RNases! Therefore always wear gloves, use RNase-free water as well as glass- and plasticware. Recommended is the use of commercially available reagents for eliminating RNase and DNA contamination from the surface of glassware or plasticware e.g. RNase away! FixationCut segments of Arabidopsis roots containing feeding sites of H. schachtii (syncytia) or M. incognita (giant-cells embedded within galls) and corresponding non-infected root fragments.Immediately put the root pieces into a microcentrifuge tube containing freshly prepared and pre-chilled fixation solution and vacuum infiltrate it on ice for 15-20 min to ensure the proper penetration of the fixative. Incubate samples 42 h or longer at 4 °C on a shaker with gentle shaking.EmbeddingSubsequently wash fixed samples 3 x 10 min in 63% ethanol in PBS and 1 x 10 min in PBS.Embed the tissue in low melting agarose (5% w/v in PBS) in small petri dishes (imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150916/20150916193538_2877.jpg 50 mm) placed on a heating plate (35-40 °C) in the laminar flow. Grab the root fragments with the forceps, swab them carefully with a paper towel to remove the excess of PBS and dip them into warm agarose parallel to the bottom of the Petri dish or 12/24-well plate and approx. at the half depth of the agarose. Approx. 10 root segments/dish or 1-2 root segments/12/24-well plate (Figure 1A).Cool down the agarose in the laminar flow.Petri dishes sealed with Parafilm can be stored in the fridge (4 °C) for several weeks.Preparation of cross sections with the vibratome and DNase treatmentCut out small agarose blocks (approx. 8 mm high x 5 mm wide) containing the syncytia or non-infected root segments with a scalpel. Trim the agarose block under the microscope (Figure 1B) and glue it on the round vibratome plate with a drop of common superglue.",
    "To produce cross sections the root segments within the agarose block have to be placed perpendicular to the bottom of the vibratome plate (Figure 1B-C).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150917/20150917023427_1052.jpgFigure 1. Placement of the root fragments within a well of the 12-well plate (A; view from above), trimmed agarose block with a root fragment in the perpendicular position (B; view from the side) and agarose block glued onto the vibratome plate (C)Cut 20-25 µm thick tissue sections in the vibratome tray filled with DEPC-H2O. Using forceps (in case the tissue section remains in the agarose section) or a pipette (in case the tissue section disconnects from the agarose section) collect the sections in a watchglass or similar container filled with DEPC-H2O supplemented with RNase inhibitor.With a pipette remove the excess of DEPC-H2O (as much as possible). To prevent non-specific DNA signals digest the DNA within the tissue by adding 2 µl RNase-free DNAse and 1 µl RNase Inhibitor to the remaining DEPC-H2O covering the cross-sections. Subsequently incubate the samples overnight at 37 °C in a watchglass in a Petri dish sealed with parafilm.WashingAdd several drops of 0.5 M EDTA and incubate the cross-sections at 65 °C for 10 min to inactivate the DNase.Subsequently wash sections as follows:2 times with 2x SSC buffer1 time with 1x SSC buffer1 time with 0.5x SSC buffer2 times with ddH2OEach step should be performed with 1 ml of buffer or ddH2O in a sealed Petri dish at 37 °C for 10 min.Reverse transcriptionTransfer several sections into a PCR tube using a pipette (in ca. 11.5 µl ddH2O).Add 0.5 µl 3’ primer and 1.0 µl dNTPs and start the first step of the RT reaction: 65 °C for 5 min.",
    "Cool down the samples, incubate them at least 1 min on ice and add 4 µl of the 5x First-Strand Buffer, 1 µl 0.1 M DTT, 1 µl RNase Inhibitor and 1 µl SuperScriptTM Reverse Transcriptase. Total volume 20 µl.Run the following program in a PCR cycler:25 °C - 5 min55 °C - 1 h75 °C - 5 min (inactivation of DNase)PCRPrepare a dNTPs mix containing 10 mM dGTP, dATP and dCTP. Add to the RT-mix as follows:5.0 µl - 10x PCR buffer1.0 µl - 3’ primer (final concentration 0.5 µM)1.0 µl - 5’ primer (final concentration 0.5 µM)1.0 µl - dNTPs mix2.36 µl - 2 mM dTTP0.5 µl - DIG0.25 µl - BioThermTM Taq DNA Polymerase18.89 µl - ddH2OTotal volume 50 µl (30 µl of PCR-mix and 20 µl of RT-mix).In case of the negative control the polymerase will be omitted.Washing and detectionThe following steps are carried out under the stereo microscope at room temperature (from step G5 in dark room with a weak source of light e.g. small table lamp). Short centrifugation could be necessary between each washing step to collect the sections at the bottom of the PCR tube. This procedure might prevent the accidental removal of tissue sections during several washing rounds. You might also check the discarded liquids for unintended removed sections after each washing step. Wash the samples twice in 1x PBS buffer for 5 min.To block unspecific binding sites incubate the sections for 30 min in freshly prepared blocking solution containing 0.1% w/v BSA in 1x PBS.Remove the blocking solution and add 50 µl Anti-DIG-AP, Fab fragments diluted 1:500 in blocking solution. Incubate 1 h at RT.Remove the blocking solution containing Anti-DIG-AP, Fab fragments and wash the sections 2 x 15 min with 10x washing buffer.",
    "Using a pipette place a drop of the washing buffer containing section(s) on a microscopic slide and replace the washing buffer with 50 µl of the NBT/BCIP solution (1:50 in washing buffer). Keep the slide in darkness (use e.g. lid from chemical bottle as a cover) since the NBT/BCIP is light sensitive!From time to time observe the progress of the staining reaction under the microscope, it appears usually within first 2-3 min (keep the light exposure as short as possible).If the violet staining is clearly visible stop the reaction with ddH2O and photograph your sections. Figure 2 shows an example of an in situ RT-PCR analysis made for two β-1, 4- endoglucanases, AtCel1 and KOR3, which are specifically up-regulated in syncytia induced by H. schachtii in Arabidopsis roots.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150917/20150917023454_9201.jpgFigure 2.
