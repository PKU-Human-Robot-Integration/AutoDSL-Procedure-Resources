  "procedures": [
    "All procedures are performed following the guidelines described in \"Principles of Laboratory Animal Care\" (National Institutes of Health publication no. 85-23, revised 1985) and the approved Rosalind Franklin University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee animal protocol 08-19.\nThere are 2 important abbreviations that are used in this manuscript. 1) DM: refers to fish that are in an acute (300 mg/dl) hyperglycemic state and have been for at least 3 weeks. 2) MM: refers to fish that were 21 day (see protocol) DM fish and allowed to restore glycemic control through pancreatic regeneration. This is achieved within (14) days of drug removal. The fish are considered MM fish from this point onward. It is also important to note that fish that are referred to as control are treated identically as DM or MM fish in terms of the number of injections (saline only), the incubation times at the various temperatures and the number and timing of caudal fin amputations.\n1. Generation of Zebrafish with Diabetes mellitus, DM Fish\nPrepare both recovery and anesthetic water tanks. Recovery water is normal fish water. For anesthetic water add sufficient 2-phenoxyethanol so that a 1:1,000 dilution in normal fish water is achieved.\nPrepare a 0.3% solution (in a fume hood) of streptozocin (STZ) by adding 6 mg of STZ to 2 ml of 0.09% sodium chloride and immediately place the solution on ice . This will provide enough injection solution for the injection of approximately 20 fish in 20 min. If you exceed the 20 minute mark, stop, and make a fresh STZ solution before proceeding. In a separate tube aliquot enough saline solution for control fish. Once the STZ is solubilized all subsequent steps do not require fume hood use.",
    "Fill a ½ cc syringe equipped with a 27 1/2 gauge needle with the STZ or control solutions ensuring that no air bubbles are trapped.\nAnesthetize each fish individually by placing the fish in anesthetic water, and wait until their swimming motion ceases (1-2 min).\nOnce anesthetized briefly place the fish on a paper towel to absorb any excess water, place the fish in weigh boat and measure the mass of the fish.\nPlace the fish on a firm surface (Petri dish lid) for injection.\nInject the STZ or control solution into the peritoneal cavity of the fish by inserting the needle past the bevel into the posterior aspect of the ventral peritoneum.\n0.35 mg/g (350 mg/kg) of STZ should be delivered to each fish and the volume of the 0.3% solution required can be calculated in the following manner.\n\t\nMultiply mass of fish (g) by 0.35 to yield the amount of STZ in mg required.\ndivide the product generated above by 3 to yield the volume of the 0.3% solution required for injection in μl.\n\t\tSample: For a 0.5 g fish : a) 0.5 x 0.35 = 0.175 b) .0175/3= 0.058 ml = 58 μl.\n\t\tThe same volume without the STZ would be injected for a control fish. A sheet for volumes to inject per fish mass should be generated and used for quick reference.\nFollowing injection place the fish in the recovery water tank and monitor them for normal swimming activity. Once this has been achieved the fish are transferred to a normal living tank that is maintained at the reduced temperature range of 22 °C - 24 °C. This reduced temperature is critical for efficient induction of hyperglycemia (diabetes mellitus, DM).",
    "Although hyperglycemia is detected within 24 hr of the first injection, in order to induce a prolonged state of very high hyperglycemia the zebrafish require a frequent injection induction phase followed by weekly maintenance injections as shown below.\nWeek 1: 3 injections (Day 1, 3, 5), Week 2: 1 injection (Day 12), Week 3: 1 injection (Day 19),\nWeek 4: (Day 21) Perform assay of interest.\nAt this point the zebrafish are considered to have been in a prolonged state of hyperglycemia and exhibit the diabetic complications of retinopathy, nephropathy and also impaired fin regeneration. These are referred to as DM fish. Additionally if desired the fish can be maintained in the hyperglycemic state with weekly maintenance injections. Approximately 5% death during this process should be expected.\n2. Blood Collection and Fasting Blood Glucose Level (FBGL) Determination\nEach group of DM and control fish must include enough fish to accurately determine the average FBGL of the group as this assay requires these fish to be sacrificed.\nPrepare a labeled PCR tube for each blood sample containing 5 μl of sterile normal saline.\nFor blood collection, anesthetize fish as above, remove all water, place the fish on a microscope slide and using a scalpel, remove the head of the fish at the base of the operculum.\nCollect the blood (up to 2 μl) that is released from the fish onto the slide and quickly add it to the 5 μl of sterile normal saline pipetting up and down to make sure that the blood does not clog. Immediately place the sample on ice.\nDetermine the blood sample volume by measuring the total volume of the liquid (saline + blood) and then subtracting out the 5 μl of saline.",
    "Transfer 5 μl of the diluted blood from each PCR tube into a 1.5 ml microfuge tube and determine the blood glucose concentration using the QuantiChrome Glucose Assay Kit. This is performed by following the manufacturer's protocol without exception. Expected results: normal/control fish 60 mg/dl and DM fish 310 mg/dl.\n3. Caudal Fin Regeneration Studies\nAnesthetize fish as described in 1.0-1.4.\nPlace fish on a Petri dish lid and amputate the caudal fin in a straight line using a sterile size 10 scalpel proximal to the first lepidotrichia branching point while viewing the fin through a dissecting microscope.\nAllow the fish to recover as in 1.10 but place the fish at 33 °C for the regenerative growth phase of the assay. This is an established temperature for accelerated fin regeneration analysis.\nThe fins can be imaged at any time post amputation however we routinely examine the regenerative growth at 24, 28 and 72 hr following trans-section.\nAnesthetize fish as before (see 1.0-1.4), place the fish under a dissecting microscope equipped with a camera (we use a Nikon SMZ-1500 equipped with a Q-imaging Camera) and collect all fin images at 1X magnification with NIS elements software. The fin should be spread for imaging so that it is fully extended without stretching or damaging the tissue and should be free of any water droplets. For consistency always place the dorsal side to the right.",
    "Print images and measure the regenerative growth area using Image J software and the use of a drawing pad. Trace around the whole area of new growth and determine the area. Each measurement should be made five times and averaged to ensure accuracy of tracing. It is important that the images used do not have shadows or water droplets as these contribute to errors in measuring the outgrowth area.\nMeasure the length of the amputation site along the dorsal-ventral axis and divide the area determined in 3.6 by this measurement. This allows fish of different sizes to be compared directly.\n4. Generation of Metabolic Memory (MM) Zebrafish\nInitiate a group of DM fish and their appropriate controls as described in section 1.\nAt 21 days determine the FBGL for a subset of the group and divide the DM fish into 2 subgroups. Continue weekly STZ injections for one of the groups as DM controls for the duration of the experiment. Cease STZ injection for the second group and incubate the fish at normal temperature. Within 14 days these zebrafish will restore normal blood insulin and glucose control through pancreas regeneration. These fish are now called MM (metabolic memory fish).\nAt day 30 post drug removal amputate the caudal fins of control, DM and MM fish via the method described in 3.2.\nReturn fish to normal water conditions for fin regeneration for 30 days. This allows the growth of what we term, metabolic memory tissue.\nAt day 60 perform a second amputation (as described in 3.2) within the tissue that was regenerated in the period from 30-60 days and perform the caudal fin regeneration assay (3.1-3.7) Figure 1.\nIsolate tissue and perform assay of interest. See Table 1 for a protocol summary.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
