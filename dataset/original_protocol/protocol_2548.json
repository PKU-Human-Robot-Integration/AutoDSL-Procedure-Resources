The circulating erythrocytes which are labelled by gata1:dsRed can be sorted based on the fluorescent protein expression.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2183-Fig1.jpg\nFigure1. Isolation of zebrafish erythrocytes\n(A) The adult zebrafishes with Tg (gata1:dsRed) background were incrossed to acquire the embryos. The fertilized eggs were collected and then raised in E3 embryonic medium in the incubator at 28.5°C until 2 dpf. The circulating erythrocytes which are labelled by gata1:dsRed can be sorted based on the fluorescent protein expression. Scale bar, 50 μm.\n(B) FACS results of gata1:dsRed+ cells in Tg (gata1: dsRed) embryos at 2 dpf.\nCollect the Tg (gata1:dsRed) zebrafish embryos into the 60 mm culture dish.\nAdd 1 mL DPBS into dish using a pipette.\nShake the embryos gently and remove the DPBS using a pipette.\nWash the embryos with DPBS twice.\nAdd the 1 mL digestion medium into the 60 mm culture dish and pipette up and down 10–20 times till the dissociated solution began turbidity.\nIncubate the samples at 28.5°C for 10 min and pipette up and down several times.\nNote: The digestion process can be examined under a microscope until the formation of single cells.\nAdd the FBS into the 60 mm culture dish to a final concentration of 10% for 30 s to stop trypsin dissociation.\nTransfer the sample into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge (eppendorf, 5424R) at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in DPBS containing 1% FBS.\nNote: Gentle with the pipetting during resuspension to keep the cells in good shape.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRepeat the steps 6 and 7.",
    "Discard the supernatant, resuspend the cell pellet using DPBS containing 1% FBS and filter the cells in a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube using cell strainers (BD Falcon, 352235).\nPut the cell suspensions on ice.\nThe erythrocytes (gata1:dsRed+) were sorted using MoFlo XDP (Beckman Coulter) and collected into 1% FBS in DPBS in a new 200 μL microcentrifuge tube.\nNote: The number of cells should be around 10,000–50,000 per tube.\nPut the tube on ice and prepare to perform the lysis step.\nTransposition reaction\nTiming: 1–1.5 h\nThis step describes the procedures used for transposition of open chromatin regions. The amount of transposition enzyme and time for transposition reaction need to be optimized between different cell types.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3],4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]\nCentrifuge the tube containing the RBCs at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nNote: The cells should be harvested freshly and make sure these cells are placed on ice.\nDiscard the supernatant gently without disturbing the cell pellet.\nAdd 100 μL cold DPBS to the tube and resuspend the cell pellet on ice.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant gently without disturbing the cell pellet.\nAdd 50 μL cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2 and 0.15% NP-40) into the cell pellet.\nResuspend the pellet in the lysis buffer.\nIncubate for 5 min on ice.\nCentrifuge and discard the supernatant to get the cell pellet (about 2 μL).\nAdd the transposition reaction system combining 5×TTBL, TTE Mix (components of TruePrep™ DNA Library Prep Kit V2 for Illumina, Vazyme, TD501) and H2O immediately to the cell pellet and pipette up and down gently for several times.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2183_1.csv\nIncubate the sample at 37°C for 30 min.",
    "Note: The time of transposition reaction is critical for the successful transposition of open chromatin regions. DNA extraction need to be performed immediately after the incubation step to avoid the over digestion.\nDNA extraction\nTiming: 1 day\nThis step describes the procedures used for DNA extraction after Tn5 incubation.\nPrepare the extraction mix in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2183_2.csv\nTransfer the DNA into the extraction mix.

The sample can be kept at −80°C for 1 day.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and wash pellets with 75% ethanol without disturbing the pellet.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant, air dry for 5 min and add 24 μL H2O to resolve DNA.\nDNA library construction\nTiming: 1.5 h\nThis step describes the procedures used for DNA library construction.\nPrepare the PCR reaction master mix to amplify transposed DNA fragments. The DNA was amplified by PCR using TruePrepTM DNA Index Kit V2 for Illumina (Vazyme, TD202).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2183_3.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2183_4.csv\nNote: After PCR reaction, the PCR mix can be stored at −20°C for 1 day or proceed with step 33.\nDNA fragments length purification and sequencing\nTiming: 1.5 h\nThis step describes the procedures used for DNA fragments length purification and sequencing.\nVortex the VAHTSTM DNA Clean Beads (Vazyme, N411).",
    "Add 60 μL (1.2×) DNA Clean Beads into the PCR mix.\nPipette up and down to mix the beads.\nNote: The VAHTSTM DNA Clean Beads need to be taken from the fridge and let it reach the 25°C before use.\nIncubate at 25°C for 5 min.\nPut the reaction tube on a magnetic rack to separate the beads and liquid (about 5 min).\nGently discard the supernatant, do not disturb the beads.\nAdd 200 μL freshly prepared 80% ethanol into the tube, do not disturb the beads.\nIncubate at 25°C for 30 s.\nGently discard the supernatant.\nRepeat the steps 37–39.\nOpen the cover and air dry for 3–5 min.\nNote: There should be no ethanol left because it will hamper the downstream steps.
