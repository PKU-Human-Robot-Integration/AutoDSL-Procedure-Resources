Recommended 10× objective.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/651-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10.

    "Pipet each barcode A mixture directly into the inlets following the sequence as indicated in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]. This sequence corresponds to the ordering of the channels across the center region of interest (for example, channels from top to bottom of Chip A correspond to 1-50 in the pipetting order).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/651-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.
