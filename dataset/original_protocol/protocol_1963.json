    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDesigning guide RNAs\nTiming: ∼1 day\nTo modulate expression of HERV-K(HML-2) elements, guideRNA (gRNA) sequences need to be designed targeting, ideally, as many 5′LTRs of the HERV-K(HML-2) group as possible. Various sequence databases may be considered as sources for HERV-K(HML-2) sequences of interest, for instance, Dfam (Storer et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]) and UCSC Table Browser (Karolchik et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) to retrieve sequences and subsequently generate multiple alignments that aid in gRNA design.\nCompile HERV-K(HML-2) sequences of interest from a suited database.\nDfam provides group-specific consensus sequences and pre-generated multiple sequence alignments available for download.\nAs for UCSC Table Browser,\nSelect a recent human reference genome assembly (e.g., hg19 or hg38).\nSelect group:Repeats; track:Repeatmasker; table:rmsk.\nDefine the region of interest as “genome”.\nCreate a filter depending on your HERV sequences of interest. For instance, the HERV-K(HML-2) group comprises different LTR subgroups, specifically LTR5, LTR5A, LTR5B, and LTR5_Hs. Thus identify respective LTR elements by applying those designations to “repName does match” each.\nOptionally, identify elements on plus and minus strands separately by applying “strand does match + or –”.\nRetrieve data as output format:sequence (or “all fields from selected table” in case elements compiled shall be further inspected before actual sequence retrieval).\nRetrieve data by selecting “get output”.\nDesignations of sequences retrieved in fasta format may be further modified.\nMultiply align sequences compiled from UCSC Table Browser employing a suited algorithm, for instance, MAFFT (Katoh and Standley, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) or MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). Potentially optimize the resulting multiple alignment manually using a suited software.\nUse the consensus sequence generated from the multiple alignment (or as provided by Dfam) for gRNA design. Software such as CRISPR-ERA (http://crispr-era.stanford.edu/[href=http://crispr-era.stanford.edu/]) may be employed for gRNA design.\nNote: The Cas9 protein used in this study recognizes NGG as the PAM site.",
    "Potentially further assess (dis)similarities of gRNA sequences with target sequences in order to identify best suited gRNAs.\nSelect at least two gRNAs suggested by the software, with an emphasis on least off-target effects and maximum efficiency.\nNote: We usually choose 2–3 different gRNA sets and test their efficiency in a HEK293T-dCAS9-VP64 and HEK293T-dCAS9-KRAB cell line before moving into human stem cells. HEK293T-dCAS9-VP64 as well as HEK293T-dCAS9-KRAB can be generated in the same way as explained in this protocol.\nCritical: gRNA design is crucial and care should be taken in order to limit off-target effects. We employed two gRNAs targeting HERV-K(HML-2) LTRs to ensure proper activation or repression, as described in Kearns et al. (Kearns et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nCloning of guide RNAs (gRNAs)\nTiming: ∼3–4 days\nDesigned gRNAs are cloned into lentiviral transfer vector pLKO.1-puro U6 sgRNA BfuAI stuffer (Addgene #50920) to ultimately generate a hPSC line stably expressing dCAS9 and the respective gRNA pair.\nDigestion of lentiviral plasmid vector.\nAssemble the restriction digestion reaction set up on ice as shown in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. Digest 1 μg of lentiviral vector (pLKO.1-puro U6 sgRNA BfuAI stuffer) with 1.5 units of BfuA1 enzyme in a 50 μL reaction. Pipette and combine all the reagents into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, mix well by tapping the tube or by gently pipetting up and down and spin them down to collect the entire reaction mixture at the bottom of the tube. Incubate the reaction at 50°C for 1.5–2 h in a benchtop heating block or a water bath. Terminate the reaction by heat inactivation at 65°C for 20 min.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1561_3.csv\nDouble-check proper digestion by electrophoresis of 3 μL of the digestion in a 0.8% [w/v] agarose gel.",
    "For preparing the agarose gel for purification of the remaining plasmid vector, mix 0.8 grams of electrophoresis grade agarose and 100 mL of 1× TAE buffer and boil in a microwave until the agarose dissolves completely. Cool the agarose solution to approx. 45°C. Add Ethidium Bromide and pour the gel in a clean standard gel casting tray with a comb with a sufficiently large well volume. Allow the gel to solidify.\nNote: Extreme care should be taken while working with Ethidium Bromide by complying with all the safety requirements.\nLoad the digested vector sample along with a tracking dye (e.g., Bromophenol Blue) and a suited DNA size standard.\nUse undigested vector as a control for proper and complete digestion.\nPerform electrophoresis in 1× TAE buffer at approx. 100–120 V. Ensure adequate separation of restriction fragments by electrophoresis for 20–30 min. The restriction enzyme-treated plasmid should linearise and produce a single DNA fragment. Visualize DNA fragments on a standard UV table.\nOnce complete digestion of the vector is confirmed, purify the remaining digested vector using a PCR purification kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions https://www.mn-net.com/media/pdf/02/1a/74/Instruction-NucleoSpin-Gel-and-PCR-Clean-up.pdf[href=https://www.mn-net.com/media/pdf/02/1a/74/Instruction-NucleoSpin-Gel-and-PCR-Clean-up.pdf].\nWe usually use Macherey Nagel NucleoBond PCR purification kit. Elute the digested plasmid DNA in 20 μL of nuclease-free water.\nYou may also load the entire reaction product onto an agarose gel and, after electrophoresis, extract the digested vector DNA from the agarose gel. Excise the digested product using a clean razor blade by placing the gel on a UV transilluminator and transfer the gel slices into a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Purify DNA from extracted gel pieces using a suited Gel extraction Kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions.",
    "Note: As for gel extraction of restriction fragments, remove as much excess gel as possible. Protect eyes and skin from UV light while handling the agarose gel on the UV transilluminator.\nNote: The agarose gel should be exposed to UV for as short as possible to minimize UV induced DNA damage. Nucleic acid stains other than ethidium bromide, not requiring illumination by UV, may be used instead.\nAfter the purification step, measure the concentration of the digested plasmid vector DNA using a Nanodrop.\nLoad and electrophorese 100 ng of the purified vector sample in a 0.8% agarose gel to control for proper digestion and purification.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1561-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Cloning of guide RNAs (gRNAs)\nAgarose Gel electrophoresis showing partial digestion of plasmid pLKO.1-puro U6 sgRNA BfuAI stuffer using BfuAI enzyme.\nCritical: Digestion of plasmid vector with BfuA1 is extremely crucial for successful cloning of single guide RNAs into the lentiviral backbone. The vector should be completely digested. After 2 h of digestion, check 3 μl of the digested product on an agarose gel along with the undigested vector. If it is not completely linearized (as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]), prolong the digestion for another hour. Excess amounts of BfuA1 enzyme might also hamper the digestion efficiency. Always perform the digestion in a total volume of 30–50 μl.\nAnnealing of single guide RNA oligonucleotides.\nUpper and lower strands of single guide RNA oligonucleotides must be annealed before proceeding for cloning. The annealing reaction set up for the first pair of gRNA (G3) for HERV-K(HML-2) is given in the Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]. The same is to be done for the second gRNA (G10). Refer to the “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]” section for the composition of the annealing buffer.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1561_4.csv",
    "Add 1 μL of the upper strand of the oligonucleotide and 1 μL of the lower strand of the oligonucleotide. Incubate the reaction mixture at 95°C for 5 min and then ramp down to 25°C at 5°C/min. For annealing the desired oligos, set up a reaction in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube as shown in Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1561_5.csv\nThe annealed oligos are to be used as the insert for the ligation reaction.\nLigation of the gRNAs. To ligate the annealed gRNA oligos into the pLKO.1-puro U6 sgRNA BfuAI stuffer vector, set up a ligation reaction (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]).\nUse 50 ng of the digested and purified pLKO.1-puro U6 sgRNA BfuAI stuffer.\nAs for the insert, pre-dilute the annealed gRNA oligonucleotides 1:10 using nuclease free water, add 4 μL of the 1:10 dilution per reaction mix.\nAdd 1 μL of 10× NEB ligase buffer and 1 μL of T4 DNA ligase.\nNote: Include a “vector-only” reaction as a control. Add 4 μl of nuclease free water instead of the gRNA insert for that control.\nTransformation of the ligation reaction.\nPre-warm ampicillin-agar plates in a 37°C incubator.\nSet a water bath to 42°C.\nThaw a required amount of E. coli competent cells, stored at −80°C, on ice. We used E. coli strain Stbl3. For each transformation, use 30 μL of Stbl3 cells.\nNote: Competent cells can also be self-made as described in, for example, (Inoue et al., 1990[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nAdd 5 μL of vector-plus ligation reaction to 30 μL of Stbl3 competent cells kept on ice. The same for the ligation control reaction.\nDO NOT mix with a pipette, but gently tap the tube, then incubate on ice for 30 min.\nSubject the reaction to a heat shock in a water bath at 42°C for 45 s.",
    "Snap-cool the reaction for 5 min on ice.\nAdd 200 μL of prewarmed S.O.C nutrient medium and grow the cells in a 37°C shaking incubator for 45 min.\nPlate the transformation mixes (“vector-only” as well as “vector-plus ligation”) onto prewarmed LB Agar plates with the respective antibiotics, here Ampicillin (100 μg/mL), using a sterile loop and incubate at 37°C for 16–18 h in a bacterial incubator.\nOn the next day, check for growth of bacterial colonies on the agar plate.\nThe vector-only ligation control plate is expected to show no colonies.\nNote: Some colonies might grow on the “vector-only” ligation control plate due to sporadic relgation events.\nThe vector-plus ligation should show at least 90% more colonies on the plate in comparison with the vector-only control.\nPick at least 5–8 single colonies from the vector-plus ligation plate and inoculate in 5 mL of LB media supplied with 5 μL of Ampicillin.\nIncubate in a shaker at 37°C shaker for 16–18 h.\nOn the next day, the culture should appear cloudy.\nSpin down the bacterial culture for 5 min at 1,000 × g at 20°C–25°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and store the pellet in a -80 deep freezer or proceed to plasmid DNA isolation directly.\nCritical: The transformation may be done according to standard protocols. Choice of suited competent cells for transformation is crucial in this cloning method, especially when working with lentiviral plasmids. Therefore E. coli competent cells with low recombination rate should be used.\nIsolation of Plasmid DNA. Isolation of plasmid DNA may be done according to the manufacturer’s instructions, for instance, Machery Nagel NucleoSpin Plasmid DNA isolation Kit https://www.mn-net.com/media/pdf/45/51/02/Instruction-NucleoSpin-Plasmid.pdf[href=https://www.mn-net.com/media/pdf/45/51/02/Instruction-NucleoSpin-Plasmid.pdf].\nPrepare 5-6 bacterial culture tubes with 5 mL of LB medium supplied with 5 μL of ampicillin (100 mg/mL) each.",
    "Pick a single colony from the bacterial transformation agar plate using a pipette tip and transfer into culture medium.\nIncubate the culture at 37°C in a shaker for about 16 h.\nNote: Care should be taken not to overgrow the culture as it can affect plasmid DNA yield negatively.\nOn the next day, pellet bacteria at 11,000 × g for 30 s, and start plasmid DNA isolation.\nDiscard supernatant.\nAdd resuspension buffer A1 and vortex.\nNote: Vortexing the pellet after adding resuspension buffer will increase the DNA yield.\nAdd buffer A2 and invert tube 6–8 times.\nIncubate at 20°C–25°C for 5 min.\nNote: Do not vortex at this step, as this will release chromosomal DNA into the suspension.\nAdd pre-cooled buffer A3 and invert tube 6–8 times.\nCentrifuge the suspension at 11,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nLoad the cleared lysate onto the column.\nCentrifuge the column at 11,000 × g for 1 min.\nWash the column with buffer AW.\nCentrifuge the column at 11,000 × g for 1 min.\nWash the column with buffer A4.\nCentrifuge the column at 11,000 × g for 1 min.\nDry the silica membrane by centrifugation of the column at 11,000 × g for 2 min.\nElute the plasmid DNA in 30–50 μL of nuclease-free water at 11,000 × g for 1 min.\nMeasure the DNA concentration in a Nanodrop.\nThe successful insertion of the guide RNA sequence into the vector needs to be verified by sequencing plasmid DNA using a U6 promoter primer.\nCritical: Before proceeding to generation of stable cell lines it is important to confirm successful integration of the respective gRNA into the lentiviral transfer vector, here pLKO.1-puro U6 sgRNA BfuAI stuffer vector, by sequencing.",
    "Critical: We usually employ HEK293T cells to test the efficiency of the cloned gRNAs and define the most efficient gRNA combinations to activate or repress specific HERV groups before further proceeding in the protocol. HEK293T cells can be transfected efficiently with the respective plasmids, instead of lentiviral infections. This usually takes a week. After defining the most efficient gRNA set we proceed to generation of stable stem cell lines.\nProduction and concentration of lentiviruses\nTiming: ∼1 week\nHere we describe how lentiviruses carrying gRNAs, dCas9-VP64 or dCas9-KRAB are produced and concentrated. Once the lentiviruses are ready they can be used to transduce human pluripotent stem cells.\nCell culture. HEK293T cells are maintained in DMEM, supplemented with 10% [v/v] FBS and 5% [v/v] Penicillin/Streptomycin, in an incubator at 37°C and 5% [v/v] CO2. Cells should be passaged every 3 days.\nCritical: It is important to use an early (less than 30) passage of HEK293T cells for viral production. Moreover care needs to be taken that HEK293T cells are not to be overgrown at any time.\nSeeding HEK293T cells for transfection.\nStart with a 80%–90% confluent T75 flask of HEK293T cells. Discard the cell culture medium, wash cells with 10 mL of 1× PBS and trypsinize cells using 2 mL of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA solution and incubate for 3–4 min at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nResuspend the detached cells in 5 mL of DMEM medium and collect in a 50 mL Falcon.\nPellet cells at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nDiscard the medium and resuspend cells gently but thoroughly in fresh 5 mL of DMEM medium.\nTake 10 μL of the cell suspension and count cells in a hemocytometer or another suited cell counting device.",
    "Seed 2 × 106 cells in 7 mL of fresh cell culture medium in a 10 cm cell culture dish.\nPlasmid transfection.\nOn the next day, HEK293T cells (at approx. 70% confluency) can be transfected with the packaging plasmid, psPAX, pMD2.G along with the transfer plasmids which contain the dCas9 fusion constructs or the respective gRNAs. In this protocol, fusion constructs pHAGE EF1 dCas9-VP64 and pHAGE EF1 dCas9-KRAB are used.\nFor transfection mixture preparation, pipet 250 μL of Opti-MEM in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube supplied with 1.5 μg of psPAX, 1 μg of pMD2.G and 1 μg of the respective transfer vector, mix the Opti-MEM and DNA by vortexing, then add 8 μL of Xtreme gene DNA transfection reagent.\nIncubate the transfection mixture for 30 min at 20°C–25°C.\nIn the meantime, replace the medium in cell culture dish with 7 mL of fresh culture medium.\nAdd the transfection mixture to the medium in a dropwise manner. Swirl the plate to evenly distribute the mixture.\nCulture the cells for 72 h in a cell culture incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nNote: Transfection efficiency can be tested by including a transfection of HEK293T cells with a transfer plasmid encoding a fluorescent marker of choice.\nCollection and concentration of viral particles.\nAfter 72 h, using a 10 mL syringe, collect the cell culture medium from the 10 cm dish, pass it through a 0.45-micron filter into a fresh 50 mL Falcon.\nTransfer the filtered medium into 100 kDa Amicon filter tubes.\nCentrifuge the Amicon filter tubes at 5,000 g for 20 min at RT.\nNote: Do not centrifuge Amicon filter tubes at more than 5,000 g to prevent tearing of the Amicon filter membrane.\nThe medium should be concentrated to approx. 250 μL.",
    "Transfer concentrated medium into fresh 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nConcentrated media containing virus particles can be used immediately or stored at −80°C for up to 3 months.\nNote: Storage of concentrated virus at −80°C for more than 3 months might reduce viral titers and transduction efficiency.\nTransduction of human pluripotent stem cells\nTiming: ∼1–2 weeks\nFor successful establishment of CRISPR activation and CRISPR inhibition method in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) (H9/ WA09) in order to manipulate expression of HERV-K(HML-2) elements, cells need to be transduced with the generated viruses carrying gRNAs as well as dCAS9-VP64 or dCas9-Krab, respectively. A detailed protocol for transducing hPSCs is described below.\nCell Culture. Human PSCs (H9/ WA09) are maintained in Essential E8 Flex medium at 37°C and 5% CO2. Cells are passaged when one of the following occurs: (1) PSC colonies are becoming too dense or too large; (2) colonies cover more than approx. 85% of the surface area of the culture dish. Passaging is done usually every 3–4 days and replacing fresh media every second day following the manufacturer’s instructions https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FEssential_8_Flex_Medium_UG.pdf[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FEssential_8_Flex_Medium_UG.pdf].\nSeeding of human pluripotent stem cell.\nCoat a 6-well culture plate with vitronectin at a coating concentration of 0.5 μg/cm2.\nThaw vitronectin at 20°C–25°C.\nNote: You will need approx. 60 μL per 6-well plate.\nAdd 6 mL of sterile 1× PBS (without Calcium and Magnesium) into a 15-mL conical tube at 20°C–25°C and add 60 μL of vitronectin.\nGently resuspend by pipetting the mix up and down several times.\nNote: This results in a working concentration of 5 μg/mL.\nAdd 1 mL of the diluted vitronectin solution to each well of a 6-well plate.\nIncubate the coated plate at 20°C–25°C for 1 h. After 45 min, proceed with step g.",
    "Note: The coated plate can be used directly or stored at 2°C–8°C, and wrapped in parafilm, for up to one week.\nDiscard the medium from an approx. 80% confluent culture of hPSCs (H9/WA09) cells in a 10 cm dish.\nWash once with 10 mL 1× PBS.\nDiscard 1× PBS and add 8 mL of EDTA solution.

Refer to the “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]” section for preparation of E8 flex medium.\nCarefully resuspend cells 2–3 times.\nNote: Resuspend with great care as it is important that cells remain in patches to avoid cell death as well as spontaneous differentiation.\nAspirate and discard the vitronectin solution (step f). It is not necessary to rinse the plate after removal of vitronectin. Cells can be seeded directly onto the vitronectin-coated plate surface.\nSeed 0.5 mL of the cell suspension (H9/WA09) into a vitronectin coated well of the 6-well plate each.\nAdd another 1.5 mL E8 flex Medium per well to reach a total volume of 2 mL per well.\nTransduction of human pluripotent stem cells (H9/WA09).\nOn the next day, check for the optimal confluency (30%–40%) of the hPSC (H9/WA09) culture (as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1561-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Add the virus/polybrene mixture to the cells.\nDo not add virus to one of the wells, this will serve as a transduction control.\nCulture the cells at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nOn the next day, replace medium with 2 mL of fresh E8 flex medium.\nNote: Cell death will occur due to viral infection.\nSelection of transduced cells.\nAllow the cells to grow for 3–4 days before selection.\nRemove medium and wash the cells twice with 1× PBS to remove dead cells.\nDetach cells using EDTA and transfer them into a vitronectin-coated 10 cm cell culture dish.\nWhen cells reach at least 50% confluency subject transduced as well as untransduced control cells to 2 μg/mL puromycin and 200 μg/mL blasticidin for 48 h.\nNote: Suited puromycin as well as blasticidin concentrations vary depending on the cell line used.\nNote: Transduction efficiency varies, depending on the virus preparation, but usually is within 50%–60% range.\nOn the next day, wash cells with 1× PBS to remove dead cells and replace medium with fresh medium containing antibiotics.\nAfter three days of selection, wash cells and add fresh medium without antibiotics and allow the cells to grow until reaching 80% confluency.\nFurther expand the cell culture and perform verification of successful integration. Freeze cell lines in liquid nitrogen following standard procedures.\nVerification of successful dCAS9-VP64 or dCAS9-KRAB integration as well as expression in hPSCs\nTiming: ∼1–2 weeks\nAfter the lentiviral transduction of hPSCs (H9/WA09) with dCas9-VP64 or dCas9-KRAB, cell lines must be verified for successful integration as well as expression of dCas9. In this section we will focus on the isolation of genomic DNA, followed by PCR to verify successful dCas-9 integration into genomic DNA (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]), as well as immunofluorescence analysis to detect successful dCas9 expression (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1561-Fig3.jpg",

Usage of filter tips and DNAse/RNAse and pyrogen-free consumables is highly recommended.\nThaw reaction buffer and dNTPs on ice.\nDilute forward and reverse primers to produce a concentration of 10 μM, for instance, from a 100 μM stock.\nDilute the genomic DNA template to 50 ng/μL from the stock concentration.\nSet up a PCR program as given in Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1561_6.csv\nNote: Determine the optimal annealing temperature by calculating the Tm of the primer pairs used.\nSet up the PCR reaction as given in Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1561_7.csv\nUse dCas9 primers to amplify the integrated dCas9 in the transduced cell lines. As an internal control for the PCR reaction, a housekeeping gene, for instance, RNA polymerase II was used (Radonić et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nFor preparing the master mix, take fresh DNAse/RNAse and pyrogen free 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nPrepare the reaction as per the manufacturer’s instructions https://www.promega.de/products/pcr/taq-polymerase/gotaq-dna-polymerase/?catNum=M3001 - protocols[href=https://www.promega.de/products/pcr/taq-polymerase/gotaq-dna-polymerase/?catNum=M3001%20-%20protocols].\nRun the reaction in a PCR machine programmed as indicated.\nNote: If the thermal cycler does not have a heating lid, overlay the reaction mixture with 50 μl of mineral oil to avoid evaporation of samples.",
