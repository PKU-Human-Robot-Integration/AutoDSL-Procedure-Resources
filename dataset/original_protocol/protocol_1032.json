    "**Protocol I: Procedure for knock-in/knock-out in cultured cells using the VIKING method**\n**Day 1: Cell culture**\n •  Incubate HaCaT or human embryonic kidney 293F \\(HEK293F) cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin \\(D10 medium).\n\\(see Remark 2).\n**Day 2: Transfection \\(Fig. 1a)**\n- Electroporation method \\(HaCaT cells)\n •  Suspend cells in 400 µL Opti-MEM.\n •  Transfect cells with the VIKING module and the target genome cleavage vector using a total of 15 µg DNA \\(molar ratio of donor cleavage vector \\(VKG1-gRNA-pX330):donor vector \\(pVKG1-PURO):target genome cleavage vector \\(pX330) = 1:1:17) using an electroporator.\n •  Transfer cells to 100 mm dishes and culture in D10 medium lacking antibiotics for 24 h.\n- Lipofection method \\(HEK293F cells).\n •  Suspend cells in 400 µL Opti-MEM.\n •  Transfect cells with the VIKING module and the target genome cleavage vector using a total of 15 µg DNA \\(molar ratio of donor cleavage vector \\(VKG1-gRNA-pX330):donor vector \\(pVKG1-PURO):target genome cleavage vector \\(pX330) = 1:1:17) using TurboFect transfection reagent.\n •  Transfer cells to 100 mm dishes and culture in D10 medium lacking antibiotics for 24 h.\n \\(see Remark 3).\n**Day 4: Selection**\n •  Refresh D10 medium.\n •  Add puromycin \\(0.3 µg/mL) to the D10 medium and culture cells for 1–2 weeks.\n**Day 14: Clone picking \\(Fig. 1b)**\n •  Wash cells with phosphate-buffered saline.\n •  Place the cloning ring on a single colony. Pick at least 20 colonies. Limiting dilution is also possible．\n •  Add 20 µL trypsin to each ring.\n •  Incubate cells at 37ºC for 2 min \\(HEK293F cells) or 10 min \\(HaCaT cells).\n •  Transfer cells to a 24-well or 48-well plate.\n •  Incubate cells at 37ºC for several days.\n •  Transfer cells to a 12-well plate and incubate.\n •  Isolate a portion of the cells for DNA extraction.",
    "**Day 16: DNA extraction**\n •  Add 180 µL of 50 mM NaOH and transfer to a 1.5 µL tube.\n •  Incubate at 95ºC for 30 min.\n •  Add 20 µL of 1 M Tris HCl, pH 8.0.\n •  Centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 10 min.\n •  Transfer the supernatant to a new tube.\n**Day 17: Genotyping \\(confirmation of knock-in by PCR) \\(Fig. 1c)**\nKnock-in and random insertion are confirmed by PCR using the extracted DNA as a template \\(see Remark 4 and 5). \nThere is no need for a special polymerase.\nGoTaq polymerase is used in this protocol.\n- Design primers to amplify the VKG1 sequence.\nExample:\nPrimer 1 \\(VKG 1_4561 F), 5'-GCCTATGGAAAAACGCCAGC-3'.\nPrimer 2 \\(VKG 1_250 R), 5'-TTCCTGTCTAGCGGTACGCG-3'.\n- Design primers that specifically bind to the target genome sequence.\nExample:\nPrimer 3 \\(VDR genome_del 3 F), 5'-GGTGGGCCTCATGTCTTCTG-3'.\nPrimer 4 \\(VDR genome_del 1 R), 5'-CCTTCATCATGCCGATGTCC-3'.\n**Genotyping by PCR**\n • PCR sample\n2× GoTaq GreenMaster Mix, 12.5 µL\n10 µM Primer A, 2.5 µL\n10 µM Primer B, 2.5 µL\nNuclease-free water, 6.5 µL\nGenomic DNA, 1 µL\nTotal, 25 µL\n • Thermocycle\n95ºC for 2 min.\n30 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 2 min.\n72ºC for 4 min.\n12ºC hold.\nStep 1. Confirm random insertion.\nPCR is performed using Primer 1 and Primer 2 for Amplicon1.\nRandom insertion is confirmed by amplification of Amplicon1.\nStep 2. Confirm knock-in at the target locus.\n- Forward direction\nPCR is performed using Primer 1 and Primer 3 for Amplicon2, or Primer 2 and Primer 4 for Amplicon3.\nKnock-in in the forward direction is confirmed by amplification of Amplicon2 and Amplicon3.\n- Reverse direction\nPCR is performed using Primer 2 and Primer 3 for Amplicon4, or Primer 1 and Primer 4 for Amplicon5.",
    "Knock-in in the reverse direction is confirmed by amplification of Amplicon4 and Amplicon5.\n**Protocol II: Procedure for knock-in in cultured cells using the VIKING method \\(Fig. 2)**\n**Day 1–16**\nSame as Protocol I.\n**Day 17: Genotyping**\n- Design primers to amplify the VKG1 sequence.\nSame as Protocol I.\n- Design primers to amplify the VKG1 sequence.\nExample:\nPrimer 1 \\(pEN_ObLi_40_For), 5'-TACCGCCTTTGAGTGAGCTG-3'.\nPrimer 2 \\(pEN_ObLi_190_Rev), 5'-AAACCTGTCGTGCCAGCTGC-3'.\n- Design primers that specifically bind to the target genome sequence.\nExample:\nPrimer 3 \\(AAVS_F5), 5'-GGAAATGGGGGTGTGTCACC-3'.\nPrimer 4 \\(AAVS_R6), 5'-CCCTACCCCCCTTACCTCTC-3'.\n**Genotyping by PCR**\nSame as Protocol I. \n**Remarks**\n1. This vector is selected according to the target locus for knock-in.\n  2. In addition to HaCaT and HEK293F cells, the VIKING method has been validated in the C4-2 \\(human prostate cancer), UMR-106 \\(rat osteogenic), and MC3T3-E1 \\(mouse preosteoblastic) cell lines. 3. These two transfection methods are examples and should be changed depending on cell lines to attain a high transfection efficiency.\n  4. The backbone of the donor vector is integrated into the genome in principle.\n  5. Tandem insertions of the donor vectors sometimes occur."
