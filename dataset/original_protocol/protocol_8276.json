    "All the procedures have been approved by the University of Hong Kong/Hospital authorities Hong Kong West Institutional Review Board (HKU/HA HKW IRB, Ref. Number: UW17-129).\nThis protocol is applicable to patients who demonstrated clinical symptoms such as numbness, tingling, or pain over the median nerve-innervated area of the hand, with a positive outcome in Tinel's sign and Phalen's test. Those subjects with comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and other peripheral neuropathies, are not eligible for this protocol.\n1. Measurement of the Nerve Conduction Studies\nAsk the patient to wash his/her hands with warm water. Dry the hands before placing the electrodes. Keep the hand skin temperature above 32 Â°C.\nMeasure the conduction in the median sensory nerve (Figure 1).\n\t\nPlace the recording (E1) ring electrode at the proximal interphalangeal joint while the reference electrode (E2) is attached over the distal interphalangeal joint.\nPlace the recording electrodes at the wrist between the tendons of the flexor carpal radialis and palmaris longus (12 cm proximal to the E1 electrode) and, ideally, proximal to the distal wrist crease. Ensure that the ground electrode is between the stimulation and recording sites.\nApply supramaximal stimulus 10x to the median nerve via the attached electrodes over the index finger.\nCollect the averaged readings of the distal sensory latency, the sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitude, and the conduction velocities displayed in the NCS system.\nMeasure the conduction in the ulnar sensory nerve (Figure 1).\n\t\nPlace the E1 ring electrode halfway on the proximal phalanx of the fifth digit while the E2 ring electrode should be located 4 cm distal to the E1 ring electrode.",
    "Place the recording electrodes near the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris (12 cm proximal to the E1 ring electrode). Ensure that the ground electrode is between the stimulation and recording sites.\nApply supramaximal stimulus 10x to the ulnar nerve via attached electrodes over the fifth finger.\nCollect the averaged readings of the distal sensory latency, the SNAP amplitude, and the conduction velocities of the ulnar nerve displayed in the NCS system.\nMeasure the conduction in the median motor nerve (Figure 2).\n\t\nPlace the recording electrode E1 in the most prominent eminence of the thenar area at the motor point of the abductor pollicis brevis (APB).\nPlace the reference electrode E2 on the proximal phalanx of the thumb.\nStimulate at the mid-palm (3 to 4 cm distal to the distal wrist crease), 6.5 cm proximal to the E1 at the wrist (between the tendons of the flexor carpi radialis and palmaris longus) and the elbow (medial aspect of the antecubital space, just lateral to the brachial artery), using an electronic stimulator.\nCollect the supramaximal readings of the distal motor latency, the compound motor nerve action potential (CMAP) amplitude, and the conduction velocities displayed in the NCS system.\nMeasure the conduction in the ulnar motor nerve (Figure 3).\n\t\nPlace the E1 over the belly of the abductor digiti minimi while the E2 is attached to the distal phalanx of the fifth digit. The ground electrode is between the stimulation and the recording sites.\nStimulate at the wrist (7 cm proximal to the E1 electrode, just lateral or medial to the flexor carpi radialis tendon), below and above the elbow (5 cm distal and proximal to the ulnar groove) (Figure 3).",
    "Collect the supramaximal readings of the distal motor latency, the CMAP amplitude, and the conduction velocities of the ulnar nerve displayed in the NCS system.\n2. Measurements Using Ultrasound\nEnsure that the patient is seated on a plinth facing the examiner, with their hands resting in a horizontal supination position and the fingers semi-extended (Figure 4).\nPlace some ultrasound gel over the probe of the transducer, the wrist site, and the distal one-third forearm (Figure 4).\nPerform a transverse scan using a 14 - 13 MHz linear array transducer at the inlet of the carpal tunnel. Freeze the real-time imaging and continuously caliper the hyperechoic epineurium of the median nerve at the inlet of the carpal tunnel (Figure 5).\nScan proximally along the innervated area of the median nerve to the site of the one-third distal forearm. Freeze the real-timing imaging and caliper the hyperechoic epineurium of the median nerve at the one-third distal forearm (Figure 6).\n3. Screening of Potential Coexisting Axonal Degeneration in Carpal Tunnel Syndrome\nScreen the possible coexisting axonal degeneration primarily based on the NCS criteria listed in Table 1.\n\tNOTE: Those patients who fulfilled the criteria for associated axonal degeneration according to the NCS criteria in Table 1 will be primarily screened for the potential coexistence of axonal degeneration.\nConsider the ultrasound readings as complementary information for screening axonal degeneration.\n\tNOTE: The patient will be considered associated with the coexistence of axonal degeneration should any of the measured readings of the ultrasound parameters be above the cut-off value(s).\nTake the ultrasound readings into account when the NCS readings failed to fulfill the NCS criteria from Table 1 (e.g., the NCS signal is absent or a conduction block or temporal dispersion occurs).",
    "NOTE: The patient can also be considered as potentially associated with axonal degeneration should any of the measured readings of the ultrasound parameters be above the cut-off value(s). Further golden standard testing, such as EMG or biopsy, can be applied for confirmation if needed.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
