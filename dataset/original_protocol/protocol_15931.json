    "This protocol describes the partial digestion of murine long bones by collagenase I. While hindlimbs are often used, the procedure is the same for forelimbs, and these can be combined to maximize cell yield. This digestion method results in 3‒6 × 106 cells released from long bones per animal (see Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.400#cpz1400-fig-0002] and Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.400#cpz1400-tbl-0001]).

For this study, 8-week-old male and female Balb/c mice and 18- or 28-week-old C57Bl/6 mice were purchased to optimize the protocol across strains, sex, and age under an approved Wake Forest School of Medicine IACUC protocol. Long bones were isolated from mice and processed as described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.400#cpz1400-prot-0001].

    "This protocol describes the isolation of bone marrow stromal cells from the vertebrae of nonhuman primates or humans. The protocol begins with the isolation from whole spines, but individual vertebrae can also be processed starting from step 6.

    "A biosafety hood is recommended due to the potential for aerosolization and biohazards associated with primate tissues.\n3. Using a bone saw, Dremel, or scalpel, remove vertebrae from the remainder of the spine.\nIf using a power tool, irrigate the area with water to prevent aerosolization of the bone. Rewrap remaining spine in gauze covering the bone and keep on ice until ready to return to freezer.\n4. Using a Dremel and a bone saw, remove spinal processes from the vertebrae.\n5. Using a Dremel and a scalpel, remove intervertebral discs from both sides of the vertebrae.\n6. Using a Dremel and a bone saw, cut a wedge into the vertebral body containing both cortical and trabecular bone and representing approximately one-sixth of the tissue mass. Further subdivide this wedge into 8 to 10 small pieces to expose as much surface area as possible for digestion.\nAdditionally, cores can be drilled from the vertebrae and will provide equivalent results.\n7.

    "This protocol describes controls that can be used to compensate for spectral overlap and to improve staining. Single color compensation controls and an unstained control are run with each experiment to determine autofluorescence. Antibody titration is performed to determine the optimal staining concentration of antibodies for high signal-to-noise peak expression while retaining identification of cell markers prior to collecting experimental data. FMO controls are conducted to assess the proper gating of positive cell populations due to the spread of the data along the log axis at the optimal antibody concentration for each multi-fluorophore staining group (Roederer, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.400#cpz1400-bib-0024]). If there is a spectral spread between channels that is not compensated by the single color stained beads, then FMO controls must be run every time. FMO analysis should be performed on fixed and unfixed cells representative of the cells being analyzed in experiments. Isotype controls, while controversial (Herzenberg, Tung, Moore, Herzenberg, & Parks, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.400#cpz1400-bib-0010]; Hulspas, O'Gorman, Wood, Gratama, & Sutherland, 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.400#cpz1400-bib-0011]; Maecker & Trotter, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.400#cpz1400-bib-0016]), can be run for each experimental group (i.e., animal age, genotype, subject) to serve as controls for nonspecific staining, which can be a problem for rare cell populations. Isotype control antibodies must be at the same final concentration and fluorophore-to-protein ratio as the experimental antibody.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.400#cpz1400-prot-0004])\nIsotype antibodies\n1.

For primate samples, within the population gated above, gate on the CD146 high and CD90 high population, and then gate the CD146 high and CD29 high population (Fig. 4D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.400#cpz1400-fig-0004]).\nCD146 is considered a definitive marker for mesenchymal stem cells (Correa et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.400#cpz1400-bib-0005]), whereas Sca1 is found on multiple murine progenitor cell populations.\nOsteoblasts\n9c. Within the population gated above, gate on the alkaline phosphatase high and CD90 high population (murine: Fig. 3E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.400#cpz1400-fig-0003]; primate: Fig. 4E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.400#cpz1400-fig-0004]).\nOnly mature osteoblasts express alkaline phosphatase.\nOsteocytes\n9d. Within the population gated above, gate on the SPARC high and podoplanin high population (murine: Fig. 3F[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.400#cpz1400-fig-0003]; primate: Fig. 4F[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.400#cpz1400-fig-0004]).\nMacrophages",
    "9e. Within the population gated above, for murine samples, gate on the CD11b high and CD68 high population followed by the CD265 low and CD115 low (Fig. 3G[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.400#cpz1400-fig-0003]). For primate samples, gate on the CD11b high and CD68 high population followed by the CD254 low and CD115 low (Fig. 4G[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.400#cpz1400-fig-0004]).\nCD265/RANK or CD254/RANKL should be low on macrophages, whereas CD11b should still be expressed highly.\nOsteoclasts\n9f. Within the population gated above, for murine samples, gate on the CD68 high and CD115 high population followed by the CD11b low and CD265 high population (Fig. 3H[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.400#cpz1400-fig-0003]). For primate samples, gate on the CD68 high and CD115 high population followed by the CD11b low and CD254 high population (Fig. 4H[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.400#cpz1400-fig-0004]).\nCD11b should be lost as monocytes/macrophages differentiate into osteoclasts. CD265/RANK or CD254/RANKL is highly expressed on differentiated osteoclasts.\n10. Calculate cell percentages or mean fluorescence intensities using analysis software, and graph to profile changes in the numbers of bone marrow-residing cells.",
    "This protocol describes how to prepare compensation beads for cell sorting and flow cytometry. Compensation beads are used to set voltages and gating parameters while running samples to obtain accurate data across experiments. The use of compensation beads for this protocol is crucial as the cells being examined are rare within the sample. Further information on compensation beads in flow cytometry has been described by Perfetto, Ambrozak, Nguyen, Chattopadhyay, & Roederer (2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.400#cpz1400-bib-0021]).\nMaterials\nCompensation beads (e.g., UltraComp eBeads; Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 01-2222-41)\nAntibodies of interest (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.400#cpz1400-prot-0004] and Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.400#cpz1400-prot-0005])\nFlow cytometry staining medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.400#cpz1400-rec-0002])\n1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube\n96-well plate\nVortex mixer\nCentrifuge\n1.
