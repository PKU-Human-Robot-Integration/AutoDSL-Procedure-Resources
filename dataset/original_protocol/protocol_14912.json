    "1. Target Cell Preparation\nMaintain target cells (e.g. Raji lymphoma cells) in growth media (RPMI 1640 culture medium, with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 4nM L-glutamine, and 500 IU/ml penicillin/ streptomycin) at 37oC in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nCentrifuge the sample to pellet the target cells in a 15 ml tube. Centrifugation time varies with different cell types; centrifuge for 3 min at 468 x g for Raji cells.\nFirst aspirate any bubbles formed on surface of the supernatant, and remove the entire supernatant.\nAdd 10 ml of PBS to the tube. Re-suspend the cells by pipetting the solution up and down several times to break up the cell clump.\nCentrifuge the sample for 3 min at 468 x g.\nAspirate any bubbles formed on the surface of the supernatant, and remove the entire supernatant.\n2. Preparation of Cell Microarrays\nObtain cell attachment 96 well plate kits or single cell array 8 well chamber slides (see table of materials/reagents).\nApply 1.2 μl of the Activator to the DNA reagent from the kit. Cap the vial, invert it, and gently shake to mix the solution.\nAllow the solution to react for 20 min at RT.\nApply the mixed solution to the target cells pellet (in the 15 ml tube).\nAdd green fluorescence cytosolic dyes at a final concentration of 500 nM.\nIncubate the target cells with the mixed solution and the dye for 30 min at RT on an orbital shaker.\nWash the cells twice with 5 ml PBS, and resuspend the cells in 10 ml growth media.\nApply 100 µl of the solution from step 2.7 to each well. Count the cell number by using a hemacytometer. Make sure cell numbers range between 5×104 to 1×106 cells per well.",
    "After 10-15 min of incubation at RT, gently wash the samples twice with 200-300 µl growth media to remove any unbound cells.\n\tNOTE: About 5-10 µl growth media remains in each well after washing.\n3. Whole Blood Cytotoxicity Assays\nAdd 180 μl of human whole blood to each sample well.\nObtain Anti-CD20 antibody solution at 5 mg/ml, and perform serial dilution to make 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1, 0.5 μg/ml of Anti-CD20 antibody solution in 1.5 ml tubes. Add 20 µl of each concentration of Anti-CD20 antibody to each sample well making triplicates.\nAdd Propidium iodide at a final concentration of 500 nM to each well.\nIncubate the resulting plate at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 16 hr.\nImage the cells on the slides or 96 well plates with an automatic imaging system with 8X magnification.\nUse the cell counting program of the automatic imaging system to quantify the results.\n\tNOTE: The software of the automatic imaging system provides simple step-by-step operations for cell counting. The protocol of using this software can be found at provider’s website.\nSelect [Review Results] from the main page of the software.\nSelect [The File Saved for The Samples].\nFirst gate FITC mean intensity >50, then gate TxRed mean intensity >20.\nSelect [Plate Overview].\nSelect [Export Tables].\n\tNOTE: The percentage cell killing formula of the program is shown below:\n\t% target cell killing = (# of cells stained both green and red/ # of cells stained green)*100%\nSubscription Required.
