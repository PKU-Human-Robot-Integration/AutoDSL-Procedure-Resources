    "The following protocol provides a step-by-step manual for using VNS in the continuous treatment of TRD. The protocol is mainly based on the experiences and recommendations of the authors from different psychiatric centers in Germany. The protocol follows the guidelines of our institution's human research ethics committee.\n1. Pre-operative Examination\nNOTE: Before performing pre-operative steps, patients must be evaluated for solid compliance and willingness to attend regular (and likely irregular) control and tuning visitations after the implantation. In particular, aspects of compliance after implantation require careful consideration.\nContraindications\nBefore implantation, exclude contraindications for VNS therapy such as acute suicidality, substance addiction, and documented and difficult-to-treat non-compliance or non-adherence during previous psychiatric and/or somatic treatments.\nNOTE: Bipolar disorders and psychotic depressive symptoms are not contraindications for VNS therapy.\nNeurosurgical examination\nAfter positive psychiatric indication and evaluation, refer the probands to surgical evaluation to determine contraindications from a surgical perspective, then evaluate the eligibility for general anesthesia.\n2. Surgical Procedure\nImplantation\nAdminister general endo-tracheal anesthesia to the patient using standard techniques. Use propofol (4–12 mg/kg/h iv) for general anesthesia. Add an analgesic drug (e.g., remifentanyl at 1 µg/kg/min iv) and a muscle relaxant (e.g., rocuronium at 0.6 mg/kg iv).\nPosition the patient supine on the operating table. Turn the head slightly to the right. Prepare the left side of the neck for supraclavicular lead implantation and an infraclavicular or axillar approach for the generator.\n\t\t\nUse a specific agent for skin preparation to avoid surgical side infection. Scrub the skin with an aqueous-based iodophor such as povidone-iodine (PVP-I).\nPerform an axillary incision by following a skin line. After hemostasis, bluntly dissect the subcutaneous fat to free the pectoralis major fascia and form a space for the generator.",
    "Make an oblique skin incision of 4 cm approximately halfway between the mastoid and clavicle, with the medial border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle at the center. Then, divide the platysma muscle and dissect the cervical fascia.\nPalpate the carotid artery to safely identify the correct neuro-vascular compartment. After opening the deep layer of the cervical fascia, carefully retract the carotid artery and internal jugular vein. The vagus nerve can be found between and below the vessels.\nNOTE: At this point, we usually continue the procedure with operating microscopes.\nDissect the vagus nerve longitudinally for approximately 4–5 cm, carefully sparing all branches and avoiding damage to the vasa nervorum.\nBring the lead in place from infra- to supra-clavicular using the tunneller device, enabling implantation.\nCarefully wrap the inferior anchor tether of the VNS lead around the caudal aspect of the vagus nerve, then fix both positive and negative contact electrodes at the nerve. Insert the connector pin into the generator infraclavicularly.\nAfter testing (see below), fix the lead with the tie-downs, facilitating a \"spare loop\". This allows the patient to move the head without tethering the probe. Suture the generator to the pectoralis major muscle fascia.\nNOTE: It is important to place the electrodes inferior to the cardiac branches of the vagus nerve to avoid cardiac side effects.\nIntraoperative lead testing\nNOTE: It is necessary to first perform an intraoperative (lead) test, which should exclude the most common and serious side effects. Most notably, asystole can occur when the VNS is activated intraoperatively.\n\t\nIn situ testing\n\t\t\nConnect the programming wand of the VNS while maintaining sterility intraoperatively in situ. Perform lead testing with a minimum of 10 seconds of stimulation of 0.5–1.0 mA and 25 Hz. If no serious cardiac side effects occur, proceed to impedance testing.\nIntraoperative impedance testing interpretation",
    "Check the impedance during the in situ testing of the device. Check repeatedly.\nNOTE: High impedances (>1,700–2,000 Ω) indicate poor contact between the helical electrodes and the nerve. During this phase, the anesthesiologist should be prepared for the occurrence of bradycardia or even asystole. Impedance is tested for a maximum of five seconds with an output current of 2.00–3.00 mA and should be under 100 Ω.\nFixing the electrodes after implantation\nUse a tunneller to position the stimulator lead by passing it from the subcutaneous thoracic pocket into the cervical incision.\nTunnel the wire, and finally, secure the loops around the nerve to reduce the probability of dislodging the electrode.\nFinishing the operative procedures\nCreate a strain relief bend to provide slack during movements of the neck.\nSecure the electrode by tacking nonabsorbable sutures to silicone head holders at the deep cervical fascia and near the sternocleidomastoid muscle.\nFix the battery to the lead electrode and anchor it with nonabsorbable sutures in the fascia. Close the incisions by standard techniques.\n3. Post-surgical Treatment and Dosing\nDischarge\nDischarge the patient one day after surgery, following an X-ray to ensure regular positioning of the device.\nVNS dosing\nCommence regular VNS dosing 2 weeks after implantation using the recommended stimulation settings (1.5–3.0 mA; 500 µs pulse width; 20–30 Hz; 30 s on, 5 min off), which must be gradually reached with 0.25–0.5 mA increases per week.\nStart dosing (recommended) at 0.25 mA intervals as needed, and increase up to 2.00–3.00 mA. Most patients (>90%) will require dosing no higher than 2.00 mA.\nDosing in cases of persisting depressive symptoms\nSet the on/off time to 30 s on/5 min off.\nEnd dosing when a response to VNS is achieved, after a maximum of 9–12 months.\nDosing alternatives in cases of non-response or partial response",
    "In cases of non-response or partial response, as an alternative to increasing the output current (mA), change the signal frequency (Hz) tuning (typically by decreasing from 30 to 20 Hz) or reduce the off time to 3 min.\nDosing in cases of side effects\nIf side effects occur (mainly laryngopharyngeal dysfunction such as hoarseness, dyspnea, and coughing), which tend to be transitory and directly associated with stimulation of the inferior (recurrent) laryngeal nerve, reduce the maximum mA tuning (typically no lower than 0.75 mA) and/or change the on/off timing.\nNOTE: An additional overview of the protocol is provided in Table 2."
