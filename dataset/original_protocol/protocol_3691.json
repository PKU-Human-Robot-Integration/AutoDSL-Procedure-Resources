This protocol is optimized for muscles that have clear identifiable tendinous insertions at both ends. Recently, a method that allows isolation of fibers from sources without tendinous ends has been published (Feige, Tsai and Rudnicki, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). We have successfully isolated fibers from soleus muscles using this protocol. Others have reported isolating myofibers from flexor digitorum brevis (FDB; (Garcia-Pelagio, Pratt and Lovering, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]), but we have not tried this. The surgery is a critical step; therefore, the strategy needs to be optimized for muscles other than EDL. Stretching the target muscles will significantly decrease the yield of viable fibers. In addition, speed is an important factor, since allowing the muscle(s) to cool excessively will also decrease yield. For those starting with this protocol, practice EDL dissections on surplus mice (i.e., mice euthanized in other experiments) prior to the experiment are advised.\nNote: These steps can be performed outside the laminar flow cabinet.\nEuthanize mouse in line with institutional regulations. Here animals were killed by cervical dislocation.\nDisinfect the hindlimbs with 70% EtOH.\nOpen the skin of one of the hindlegs to expose the lower leg muscles.\nRemove the fascia covering the TA muscle from knee to ankle using the fine-tip forceps (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/617-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Lift EDL at proximal tendon (1) and cut distal tendon to release EDL (2). The number in the pictures indicate the order of events.\nCritical: Remove as much fascia as possible, as remaining fascia will complicate the next step. If fascia are not sufficiently removed it will require more force to liberate the TA and EDL from the underlying bone and from each other. Applying too much force may damage or stretch the muscle and may decrease the yield and viability of isolated fibers .\nFree the TA/EDL muscles from the bone.\nInsert the fine-tip forceps behind the ankle-tendons of both the EDL and TA (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1F).\nLiberate the EDL and TA muscles from the underlying tibial bone by moving the forceps behind the EDL/TA up and down from knee to ankle (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C and 1G).\nLiberate the TA from the EDL.\nInsert the fine tip forceps between the EDL and TA ankle tendons and lift up the TA and carefully move the forceps up towards the knee (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H).\nExpose the proximal EDL and fibularis longus tendons by removing tissue around the patella.\nInsert the fine tip forceps behind the proximal EDL and fibularis longus tendons.",
    "Cut the proximal EDL tendon using a scalpel blade (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D and 1H).\nRemove TA muscle.\nCut the TA distal tendon (near the ankle; Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]I).\nLift the TA at the distal tendon.\nCut TA proximal to the knee to remove it (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]I). The EDL muscle is now exposed.\nRemove the EDL muscle.\nCarefully lift the EDL at the proximal tendon.\nCritical: Prevent stretching the EDL during handling (See troubleshooting – problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).\nRemove the EDL by cutting the distal (ankle) tendon (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E and 1J). Make sure to cut as distal as possible to ensure cutting the tendon, not the muscle .\nPlace the EDL into a 1.5 mL tube with 1 mL of prewarmed Col II solution and shake (500 rpm) at 37°C for 1.5 h. in an Eppendorf Thermomixer (See troubleshooting – problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).\nRepeat step-by-step method details[href=https://www.wicell.org#step-by-step-method-details] steps 3–7 for the remaining EDL.\nNote: For some steps it may be easier to turn the animal 180° (head facing towards you) for dissecting the contralateral EDL.\nCritical: To increase the yield of intact myofibers ensure to (See troubleshooting – problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]):\nWork fast to prevent excessive cooling of EDL.\nAvoid damaging the EDL when liberating the muscles at step-by-step method details[href=https://www.wicell.org#step-by-step-method-details] steps 5 and 6.\nAvoid stretching the EDL when removing it from the animal.\nPurifying intact myofibers\nTiming: 3 h\nNote: For adult FVB/N mice we usually get 150–250 fibers per EDL. Nevertheless, the yield of fibers per EDL will vary depending on the mouse model. For example, disease models with muscle damage may yield lower number of fibers compared with healthy mice (see expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]).\nIn these steps the myofibers are liberated from the digested EDL muscle and subsequently purified by sequential transferring intact myofibers into clean dishes.",
    "Note: These steps were performed outside a laminar flow cabinet. Prepare 3 × 15 mL conical tubes to disinfect and wash the utensils. 1 tube with 70% EtOH, 1 tube with PBS, and 1 tube with HS. For each use the pipet tips were cleansed by sequentially pipetting up/down 3 times in EtOH, PBS and HS. HS is to prevent fibers sticking to the walls of the pipet tips.\nLiberate fibers from the digested muscles.\nTake purification dish #1 (dish 1-1) for the first EDL (EDL1) from incubator and place on slide warmer.\nEmpty tube with EDL in dish #1-1.\nCut ±2 mm from the top of a sterile 1 mL plastic pipet tip (Fisher Scientific cat # 22170403) and polish by carefully passing the pipet tip through the flame (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) (See troubleshooting – problems 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/617-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

To work outside the laminar flow cabinet, prepare a clean curtailed/polished 1 mL pipet tip by pipetting up/down, respectively, EtOH, PBS and HS. The pipette is now ready to use. Repeat this step each time you insert the pipette tip in medium again.\nPipet up/down with HS before using a new tip to coat it and prevent adhesion of muscle fibers to the inside of the tip.",
    "Release myofibers by pipetting EDL up/down using a P1000 pipette.\nCritical: Aspirate and eject the EDL along the length axis; pipet in a smooth motion (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). Too much force will damage the myofibers and decrease the yield and viability of the isolated fibers. After the EDL breaks down in smaller parts, move the EDL parts along the length axis through the pipette tip (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1: Liberating myofibers from digested EDL muscle, related to step-by-step method details step 10\nThe video shows the first aspirating and releasing steps with the digested EDL.

This step is performed with the dish on the slide warmer.\nContinue for maximally 10 min., then place dish #1-1 back in the 37°C incubator. Leave the dish for at least 15 min to recover (See troubleshooting – problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).\nPerform step-by-step method details[href=https://www.wicell.org#step-by-step-method-details] steps 10a-f for EDL2 in a new dish (dish 2-1).\nWhile myofibers released from EDL2 are recovering repeat step-by-step method details[href=https://www.wicell.org#step-by-step-method-details] steps 10f-g for dish #1-1.\nAlternate between dish #1-1 and #2-1 until no more fibers release.",
    "Note: Although isolated viable myofibers can reach up to 5 mm in length, they are typically 1.5–3 mm long, transparent, with smooth sarcolemmal surface when visualized using phase contrast microscopy (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). However, it is unclear whether isolated fibers are intact fibers or whether they self-seal (Järvinen et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Cross-striations and protuberant peripheral nuclei are visible at 200× magnification. Contracting, dying, and damaged fibers are short, opaque, and often curved.\nSequentially select viable myofibers.\nPlace dish #1-1 (with fibers) under the dissection microscope and dish #1-2 (empty dish with warm fiber selection medium) on the slide warmer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nCurtail and flame-polish a 200 μL tip (Fisher Scientific cat # 10739254).\nNote: The sharp edges left after cutting the tips using scissors may damage the fibers while pipetting up and down. Polishing using a flame will smoothen the edges of the tips for successful isolation of viable myofibers.\nOptional: When working outside a laminar flow cabinet clean pipet tip through EtOH, PBS, and HS as described above. Repeat this for each new pipette tip.\nTransfer transparent, elongated, straight myofibers from dish #1-1 to dish #1-2 using a P200 pipette (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3] and S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).

    "Continue selecting myofibers for maximally 10 min before returning the dishes to 37°C incubator. Leave the dishes for (at least) 15 min to recover.\nIn the meanwhile, perform step-by-step method details[href=https://www.wicell.org#step-by-step-method-details] steps 11a-d for dish #2-1 and #2-2.\nWhen dish #1-1 contains no more intact myofibers, repeat step-by-step method details[href=https://www.wicell.org#step-by-step-method-details] steps 11a-d to transfer myofibers from dish #1-2 (under dissecting microscope) to dish #1-3 (on slide warmer). The same applies for EDL2: when dish #2-1 is empty, start transferring myofibers from dish #2-2 to #2-3.\nWhen dishes #1-3 and #2-3 contain no more viable myofibers (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D), move fibers to the dish with experiment base medium (dishes #1-4 and #2-4, respectively).\nNote: Experiment base medium is medium used for the actual experiment but without experiment additives such as growth factors, inhibitors, activators etc. These additives have been added to the respective wells during plate preparation (see before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] step 12).\nContinue transferring fibers to dish #1-4 and #2-4 until no more viable myofibers are detected in dish #1-3 and #2-3, respectively.\nNote: When the yield is high (>250 myofibers from 2 EDL muscles), dishes #1-4 and #2-4 may still contain debris and fiber fragments. If necessary, add an extra purification step by introducing a fifth dish (dishes #1-5 and #2-5) with experiment base medium and continue purifying intact viable fibers. A highly pure collection of myofibers is necessary to prevent transferring contaminants to experimental wells.\nOptional: If proliferation of non-myogenic cells is observed using this culturing strategy, an alternative plating method can be used to ensure formation of pure myogenic fiber-derived cultures, as described in the Optional Step below.",
    "Optional: Single fibers can be first cultured for 48 h in experiment base medium in dishes coated with 20% HS. This promotes contaminating non-myogenic cells to release from the fibers and to adhere to the dish, while at the same time preventing fibers to adhere to the bottom of the well. After this step, single fibers are replated in the experiment dishes and the protocol can continue as described below (step-by-step method details[href=https://www.wicell.org#step-by-step-method-details] step 12a).\nPlating myofibers for assessment of satellite cell activation.\nPlace the 96-well plate prepared at before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] step 12 in an incubator at 37°C for at least 15 min to warm.\nPlace the 96-well plate on slide warmer.\nUse a freshly cut and polished tip (cleaned with EtOH, PBS and HS as described at the note before step-by-step method details[href=https://www.wicell.org#step-by-step-method-details] step 10) to select a single viable myofiber in 50 μL experiment base medium from dish #1-4 (EDL1) or #2-4 (EDL2), and transfer to a 96-well containing 50 μL experiment medium (i.e., medium with 2× concentrated treatment).\nNote: As mentioned in before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] step 12b, the respective treatments in the 96-well plates are 2× concentrated and will be diluted to the appropriate concentration automatically by adding the myofiber in medium.\nCritical: Avoid transferring any debris with the myofibers, as this may affect the experiment outcome (Tsuchiya et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nPick the next fiber and allocate to a well containing the next treatment (i.e., next row in the plate layout).\nNote: We recommend adding a single myofiber to the first well of each treatment before transferring a myofiber to the second well per treatment (first well of next column). This approach allows equal and random distribution of myofibers across all treatments and minimize selection bias (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).",
    "After 10 min return the 96-well plate and fiber-containing dish to the incubator.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/617-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Suggested fiber pipetting scheme\nTreatments are arranged in rows. Start adding the first fiber to well A1 (treatment 1), the second to well B1, etc. The dashed red line indicates the order of adding fibers to the respective wells.\nContinue with a second set of dishes or wait 15 min before resuming picking intact myofibers.\nIncubate the myofibers in the respective treatments for desired times. Typically, myofiber-derived colonies can be observed within 72 h after start incubation. Treatment time depends on background strain and selected treatments (See troubleshooting – problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]).\nFixation and immunostaining myofibers\nTiming: 5 h\nFixing treated myofibers.\nPre-warm 8% PFA (v/v) at 37°C.\nPlace 96-well experiment dish with cultured fibers on slide warmer.\nAdd 100 μl of prewarmed 8% PFA (v/v) to each well and incubate for 15 min.\nCritical: This step has to be performed inside a chemical safety cabinet to contain toxic fumes.\nNote: After incubating 15 min in PFA, plates can be further processed at 18°C–22°C .\nAspirate PFA solution and replace with PBS.\nNote: Fixed fibers can be stored at 4°C up to 2 weeks or stained directly.\nCritical: Rinse wells thoroughly with PBS to remove all PFA. This is to prevent over-fixation, as this will compromise subsequent immunostaining and may require antigen retrieval approaches.\nImmunostaining fiber-derived cells.\nNote: Activation of myogenic cells can be measured assess in several manners. Here we describe a PAX7 and KI67 co-staining that allows to assess proliferative, thus activated, myofiber-derived cells. (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). Additionally, we describe a PAX7 and MYOD co-staining that allows a complementary method to assess activation of myogenic cells (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). Other combinations of antibodies are possible (See troubleshooting – problems 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]).",
