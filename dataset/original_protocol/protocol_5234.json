    "Acute reporter assay in liquidThe acute assay in liquid is used for the determination of the expression of reporter genes induced by short exposure to heavy metals. It can also be used for the preparation of protein extracts of treated worms. For the determination of reporter expression, we recommend using worm strains carrying an appropriate GFP reporter, such as gcs-1p::gfp. Some worm strains carrying a GFP reporter are available from Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC) (Table 1). Table 1.

    "Prepare worms grown on 6 cm NGM dishes with OP50. Although the mixed stage of worms is acceptable, a specific stage of worms (except embryos) can be used if you desire. Avoid starving the worms.Adding the proper amount of heavy metal solution to M9 buffer (Notes 1 and 2). Dispense 0.5 ml of the solution to 1.5 ml tubes.Add 1 ml of M9 buffer (without heavy metals) to the NGM dishes, in which worms are grown, and gently shake it. Transfer the M9 buffer containing worms from NGM dishes to 1.5 ml plastic tubes, using gelatin-coated 1 ml pipetman tips (Note 3). Although the concentration of worms depends on the culture conditions, we usually use approximately 1,000 worms per ml. The worm numbers can be estimated by transferring 10 μl of the solutions to a slide glass just after vortexing and counting the number of worms under a stereomicroscope.Centrifuge at 700 x g, 2 min, 20 °C. Discard the supernatant. Add 1 ml M9 buffer to the tube and centrifuge at 700 x g, 2 min. Discard all but a small aliquot (< 0.05 ml) of the supernatant. Transfer the appropriate amount of worms to 1.5 ml plastic tubes filled with 500 μl of heavy metal-containing M9 buffer. Do not exceed 20 μl of worm volume in each tube.Rotate (2 sec/rotation to keep an aerobic condition) at 20 °C (or room temperature) by rotator, from 30 min to a few hours. While waiting, make an agar pad for the end of incubation with heavy metals (Video 1). First, add a double-layered paper tape on the surface of two slide glasses. Place a clean slide glass side by side between the two taped slide glasses (Figure 1A).",
    "Put 100 μl of 2% agarose solution with 10 mM sodium azide in the middle of the clean glass (Figure 1B), then immediately put another clean slide glass on the agarose perpendicular to the bottom slide glass (Figure 1C). After 1 min, carefully remove the two taped slide glasses (Figure 1D), and then remove the top slide glass (Figure 1E). Avoid drying until ready to use.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Making an agar pad imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170530/20170530235032_8370.jpgFigure 1. Preparation of agar padCentrifuge at 700 x g, 2 min. Discard the supernatant and retain the remaining ~50 μl of M9 with worms. Transfer the worms from the 1.5 ml tube to an NGM agar dish (without heavy metals) by using a gelatin-coated pipetman tip. Put 2 μl of M9 on the agarose pad. Pick the worms from the NGM dish, transfer them to the agarose pad, and seal with a cover glass. Immediately use a fluorescent microscope to determine the fluorescence intensity of the reporter gene.Acute reporter assay on dishThis assay is suitable for a small number of worms (20-100 worms) in a desired developmental stage, except embryo.Prepare NGM solution (see Recipes) for dishes.Add the appropriate amount of heavy metal stock solutions into 50 ml Corning tubes (see Note 2). Add 50 ml of NGM solution at 60 °C into each tube and shake them to mix. Incubate at 60 °C until bubbles disappear. Pour into 3.5 cm dishes. Pour also the remaining NGM solution into 3.5 cm dishes (use as a control). Leave overnight at room temperature. Make an overnight culture of OP50 with LB broth. Add 20 μl of the OP50 solution to the 3.5 cm dishes. Leave overnight at room temperature.Transfer the plates into closed boxes or wrap them with polystyrene bags and store at 4 °C until use.",
    "Just before use, incubate the dishes at 20 °C for 1 h (Note 4). Put > 20 young adults (grown 1-3 days from late L4 stage) in a 3.5 cm NGM dish containing heavy metal by using a worm pick made from a platinum wire attached to the tip of a Pasteur pipet (Note 5). As a control, use NGM dishes without heavy metals. Incubate for 30 min to several hours at 20 °C.While waiting, make agarose pads (see Procedure A: Acute reporter assay in liquid). Transfer the worms onto an agarose pad and determine the fluorescence intensity of the reporter gene using a fluorescent microscope.Acute assay for immunoblottingWhen you want to prepare protein extracts for Immunoblotting, perform the following procedure (Note 6). Note: Steps C1 to C8 is the same as A1 to A8 in ‘Acute reporter assay in liquid’.Centrifuge tubes at 700 x g, 2 min. If the amount of worm pellet seems to exceed 25 μl at this step, divide the samples to additional empty tubes and re-centrifuge them.Add 1 ml M9 buffer and centrifuge at 700 x g, 2 min. Discard the supernatant and retain the remaining approximately 50 μl of M9 with worms. We estimate the approximate volume of the worm solution by comparing with a sample tube that contains 50 μl of water, and then confirm by sucking the solution with a pipetman adjusted to 50 μl with a gelatin-coated tip.Add 25 μl of 3x SDS sample buffer.Boil in water bath (or heat block) for 3 min. Centrifuge the samples at 15,000 x g for 3 min before loading. The samples can be used for immunoblotting of desired proteins, such as PMK-1 and phosphorylated PMK-1 (Inoue et al., 2005). Growth assayGrowth assay is used for the determination of the sensitivity to heavy metals.",
    "This assay can also be used for the survival assay.Follow the steps B1-B6 of the procedure in ‘Acute reporter assay on dish’.Transfer > 20 young adults to a 3.5 cm NGM dish without heavy metals. Incubate for several hours at 20 °C.Pick ~50 eggs from the NGM dishes and transfer them to an NGM assay plate containing heavy metal (see Video 2). E. coli grown on the normal NGM dish is used as glue to attach the eggs to the platinum wire (Note 7). As a control, transfer the same number of eggs to an NGM plate without heavy metals. Seal the side of each dish with Parafilm. Incubate at 20 °C. The next day, determine the number of hatched eggs by counting the unhatched eggs. Continue to incubate at 20 °C.The worms that developed into adulthood are counted 4 days after egg laying (Note 8).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2.
