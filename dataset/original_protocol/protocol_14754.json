    "The study was conducted with the prospectively approval of the hospital’s Ethics Committee; informed consent was obtained. The study was in adherence to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.\n1. Donor Endothelium Preparation\nUse a donor cornea as prepared by the local eye bank at room temperature.\nIn the surgery room, pull out the donor cornea from its delivery container and set apart the solution for tissue preservation and nutrition that is used for corneal transport.\nPlace the donor corneo-scleral rim over an artificial anterior chamber, into which a liquid can flow and create a variable pressure; cover the cornea with the tissue retaining head.\nConnect the artificial anterior chamber (AAC) through a 3-way connector to a syringe filled with the cornea preservation and nutrition liquid.\nUse the compression ring to hold the retainer securely in place.\nUse the syringe connected to the AAC to maintain the intracameral pressure: fill the anterior chamber with the tissue preservation solution until reaching the optimal pressure (see 1.7). Close the connector.\nTest the pressure inside the anterior chamber with a finger. Change the inside pressure until reaching the right internal pressure (in the range 60–70 mmHg). Close the 3-way connector.\nMeasure the thickness of the donor cornea with Optical Coherence Thomography (OCT). Maintain the anterior chamber with that cornea in a fixed position in front of the instrument optics and then take a full thickness-OCT acquisition.\n2. Femtosecond Laser Preparation of Donor Endothelium\nPerform applanation of the donor cornea under the femtosecond laser device. Use the femtosec laser to cut the donor tissue with three subsequent cuts: posterior side cut, full lamellar and anterior side cut. Set the following parameters for the three cuts.",
    "For the full lamellar cut (raster pattern, start out), set the cut depth corresponding to the thinnest point of the donor cornea (measured with the OCT as described in 1.8), always subtracting 95 µm. Set the pulse energy in the range 0.8-0.9 µJ (depending on the working depth). Set the diameter to 8.7 mm. Set the tangential spot separation to 2 µm. Set the radial spot separation to 2 µm.\nFor the anterior side cut, set the posterior depth 30 µm deeper than the previous full lamellar cut. Set the pulse energy to 2.10 µJ; the diameter to 8.6 mm; the spot separation to 3 µm, while the layer separation to 3 µm.\nFor the posterior side cut, locate the anterior depth of the posterior side cut 30 µm anteriorly than full lamellar cut. Set the posterior depth to 900 µm. Set the pulse energy to 2.10 µJ; the diameter to 8.3 mm; the spot separation to 2 µm; the layer separation to 2 µm.\n3. Recipient Eye Preparation\nPrepare the patient for surgery. Make one 4.00 mm corneal incision at 12 o'clock with a 4.0 mm precalibrated blade. Make one limbal paracentesis with a 1.2 mm precalibrated blade, placed at 2 o'clock. Make another one limbal paracentesis at 6 o'clock with a 30° stab knife.\nInsert an anterior chamber maintainer in the patient’s anterior chamber, through the 2 o'clock paracentesis.\nPerform one 8.2 mm diameter circular descemetorexis with the dedicated hook.\nStrip the Descemet membrane and endothelium from the posterior stroma and remove the tissues with a Descemet hook.\n4. Chromophore Preparation\nPut 1 mg of Indocyanine Green powder in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 9 mg of sterile water (the ICG water solution is 10% w/w).",
    "Manually mix the ICG powder and the water with a metal stirrer.\n5. Staining of Donor Endothelium\nPut the donor endothelium onto the wider part of a Busin-injector, with the inner side in contact with the injector surface.\nStain the inner side of donor endothelium with the chromophore solution, in its peripheral part, using a spatula. The correctly stained tissue has a homogeneous greenish color. Wait 3 min before starting step 5.3.\nPull the donor endothelium on the anterior part of the Busin-injector, rolled.\n6. Inserting the Donor Endothelium\nGrasp and insert the folded donor endothelium using an atraumatic coaxial forceps for endothelial lenticule.\nRemove the anterior chamber maintainer.\nSuture the corneal incision and the paracentesis (performed in step 3.1) with a Nylon 10.0 single stich.\nInject an air bubble to unfold the donor tissue and to press it against the recipient cornea. The air bubble must completely fill the anterior chamber space.\n7. Laser Welding\nPlace the donor lenticule in the center of the recipient cornea, from inside with a hook or moving the air-bubble from the outside of the cornea with a spatula.\nUse a diode laser emitting at 810 nm, equipped with a 300 µm core diameter sterile fiber optic, with 0.22 as a numerical aperture (NA).\nKeep the fiber tip outside the eyeball, and deliver the laser light towards the stained endothelium, through the transparent corneal tissue. The fiber tip is in non-contact configuration.\nUse the following settings for the laser: single spot emission mode, 70–80 msec pulse duration, 35–40 mJ per pulse. He-Ne aiming beam on.",
    "Deliver single laser spots at the stained periphery of the donor endothelium. Deliver the spots sequentially: the final aspect is a ring of spots in the periphery of the donor lenticule. The distance between two adjacent spots center is the double of a spot diameter.\nApply a contact lens on the patient eye, along with 0.3% tobramycin and 0.1% dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension.\nSubscription Required.
