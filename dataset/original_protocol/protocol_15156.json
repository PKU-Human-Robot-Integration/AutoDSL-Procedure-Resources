    "Mouse allograft and syngeneic graft transplantation model\nAll animal studies were approved by the institutional animal care and use committees of Yale University. For allograft model, segments of thoracic aorta from male, 4-5 week old WT (C57BL/6J) or IFN-γR-KO mice were interposed into the abdominal aorta of female recipient, 8-12 week old WT using an end-to-end microsurgical anastomotic technique (see next for details). For syngeneic graft model, segments of thoracic aortae from male, 4-5 week old WT mice were interposed into the abdominal aortae of male, 8-12 week old IFN-γR1-KO using an end-to-end microsurgical anastomotic technique. At 1 week postoperatively, the animals were inoculated i.v. with Ad5.CMV-mouse IFN-γ or Ad5.CMV-LacZ (Qbiogene) at 1 x 109 PFU. Serum mouse IFN-γ levels were measured by ELISA (eBioscience) at 1 and 5 weeks after adenovirus administration. Certain animals received BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich) at 100 mg/kg s.c. for 2 weeks before sacrifice.\nEnd-to-end microsurgical anastomotic technique (Video will be taken for this part):\n1. Donor Procedure\nAnesthetize the donor mice with intraperitoneal injections of ketamine (50 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg).\nAfter ensuring adequate anesthesia, place the donor mice under the operating microscope at X8-30 magnification on a tray in a supine position, and use Iodine Prep Pad and Alcohol Prep Pad for chest wall preparation.\nIncise the anterior chest wall through the ribs and diaphragm to expose the heart.\nOpen the right atrium, inject 10 ml of heparinized (100 U/ml) saline solution into the left ventricle to flush the mice using a 10-ml syringe with a 25-gauge needle.\nResect the heart and lungs to expose the entire length of thoracic aorta.\nDissect the thoracic aorta carefully to minimize the direct trauma, while identify, ligate and divide the lumber branches using 11-0 suture near the aorta.",
    "Once the thoracic aorta is free from surrounding tissue, excise the whole thoracic aorta for transplantation.\nFlush the cut end of the donor aorta with heparinized (100 U/ml) saline solution, and store it in the same solution on ice (up to 6 hr) until transplantation.\n2. Recipient Procedure\nInject the recipient mice with i.p. ketoprofen (5 mg/kg) for analgesia, and thenanesthetize the mice with i.p. ketamine (50 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). The recipient mice are deeply anesthetized within 10 minutes for a duration of 60-90 min. During surgery, the level of anesthesia is assessed every 15 min by pinching the anterior abdominal wall or foot using forceps. If the animal reacts to the noxious stimuli at anytime during surgery, an additional dose of ketamine and xylazine (1/4 or 1/3 original dose) will be administered by s.c. or i.m.\nAfter ensuring adequate anesthesia, shave off the fur in the anterior abdominal wall using an electric shaver, clean the skin using Iodine Prep Pad and Alcohol Prep Pad, cover the eyes using ophthalmic ointment. During surgery, the following aseptic techniques will be used for the operations, including cleaning the operating table with 10% bleach, wearing sterile gloves and using sterilized microsurgery instruments(steam-sterilized instruments for the start of the operation, then hot glass bead-sterilized instruments between multiple operations, etc).\nPlace the recipient mice under the operating microscope at a magnification of X8-30 on a tray in a supine position.\nIncise the abdominal wall at the midline from xyphoid to pubis, and spread the abdominal wall apart using a micro-retractor to expose the abdominal cavity.",
    "Retract the intestines superiorly and wrap with gauze moistened with saline solution. The recipient mice become chilled by loss of heat through externalized intestines. It is important to maintain animal warmth. However, the heating board is not used during the surgery as modest hypothermia is of benefit in preventing spinal injury during occlusion of aortic blood flow as well as there is inefficient heat transfer with absent blood flow to the lower half of the mice body.\nMove the reproductive organs inferiorly, wrap the abdomen areas of recipient mice with saline-solution-moistened gauze, and use it to retract the rectum to right side of the abdomen. The exposed tissues are irrigated periodically with saline solution during transplantation.\nDissect bluntly a segment of infrarenal aorta between the renal vessel proximally and aortic bifurcation distally and separate from inferior vena cava (IVC) carefully.\nIdentify and ligate all of the small branches originating from this segment of abdominal aorta using 11-0 Polyamide Monofilament suture.\nCross-clamp the isolated segment of abdominal aorta using two vascular clamps proximately 5 mm apart, one at each end.\nTransect the abdominal aorta between the clamps using sharp micro-scissors to create the anastomotic sites.\nResect a small segment of abdominal aorta (up to 0.4 mm in length) from one cut end of transected recipient aorta to accommodate the donor aortic graft.\nFlush the aortic segments between clamps using heparinized saline solution to remove the residual blood. The aortic segments between clamps and the donor aortic graft are irrigated periodically with heparinized (100 U/ml) saline solution (up to 40 ml/kg) during anastomosis.\nTransect both sides of donor aorta with sharp micro-scissors to create a segment graft of 2.5 mm in length for transplantation.",
    "Place the donor aortic graft in the orthotopic position, anastomose the donor graft's proximal and distal end to the recipient's proximal and distal cut end of abdominal aorta, respectively, with an end-to-end pattern using 11-0 Polyamide Monofilament suture.\nFor the continuous sutures, place the stay sutures at 3 and 9 o'clock positions firstly. Between two stay sutures at each side of graft, anastomose both cut edges in 3-4 stitches using the running sutures, and tie the running sutures to stay sutures with a double knot. Since both layers of closure are continuous, the risk of dehiscence is increased. The donor aortic graft should be in appropriate length to connect the recipient's proximal and distal cut end of abdominal aorta.\nFor the interrupted sutures, construct four anastomosis at 3 and 9 o'clock positions in both sides of graft firstly, and anastomose both cut edges in 3-4 stitches between two stay sutures at each side of graft.\nRelease the distal clamp to allow the retrograde flow into graft, identify the bleeding sites and make additional stitches within 3 minutes.\nAfter ascertaining satisfactory hemostasis, release the proximal clamp.\nConfirm the graft patency by presence of vigorous pulsation in the graft and the proximal adjacent segment of native abdominal aorta, in particular in the distal adjacent segment of abdominal aorta and inferior mesenteric artery. Consider thrombosis in anastomotic sites if the pulsation diminish within a few minutes after the restoration of blood flow.\nReturn the intestines into the abdominal cavity.\nSuture close the abdominal wall using 5-0 Nylon suture in muscle layer and skin layer, respectively.",
    "Place the recipient mice into a clean cage on the top of a heating pad, and wait 1-2 hr for the mice to regain consciousness and recover from anesthesia. It is important to maintain animal adequate warmth during recovery. Keep the mice in the warm and dry cage before animal wake from anesthesia.\nAssess the motor function of hind limbs after mice recovery, and again on the second day. A successful transplantation surgery will be confirmed if no dysfunction of hind limbs is observed in recipient mice on the second day.\nAdminister the recipient mice with Ketoprofen in drinking water (5 mg/kg/d = 27 ug/ml in drinking water) for 48 hr. If any recipient mice suffer from pain unrelieved by the postoperative analgesics as evidenced by loss of mobility, failure to groom, abnormal bunched posture, etc, they will be euthanized. The animals will be euthanized at predefined end-points after 1-60 days.\nGraft analysis\nArtery grafts in allograft were procured at 4 weeks and grafts in syngeneic graft model were 6 weeks post-operatively (5 weeks after viral infection) and analyzed by standard histological techniques for Elastica-van Gieson (EVG) staining, hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and immunofluorescence staining. Pictures were taken using an immunofluorescence microscope system (Zeiss). Cell counting of nuclei surrounded by positive immunostaining was performed under high magnification and averaged from 5 cross-sections for each graft. The graft area measurements of the lumen (within the endothelium), intima (between the endothelium and internal elastic lamina, IEL), media (between the IEL and external elastic lamina, EEL), wall thickness (between the endothelium and external elastic lamina) and whole vessel (within the EEL) were calculated from 5 serial cross-sections, 150 μm apart for each graft, using computer-assisted image analysis and NIH Image 1.60 (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/nih-image[href=http://rsbweb.nih.gov/nih-image/]).\nStatistical analysis",
    "All data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Two-tailed, paired t tests and a two-way ANOVA analysis were performed using the Prism software program (GraphPad Software). Differences with P<0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance.Subscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
