    "The Medical College of Wisconsin Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved all protocols described in this paper and all procedures are in compliance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW) regulations.\n1. Preparation of Solutions and Vessel Chamber\nPrior to conducting a series of experiments, prepare 2 L of 20x concentrated salt stock solution consisting of 278 g/L NaCl; 14 g/L KCl; 11.52 g/L MgSO4 .7H2O; and 9.4 g/L CaCl2 .2H2O. Also prepare 2 L of 20x concentrated buffer stock consisting of 80.8 g/L NaHCO3 and 0.4 g/L EDTA, and 2 L of 20x concentrated Ca2+-free stock solution consisting of 281.6 g/L NaCl; 14 g/L KCl, and 11.52 g/L MgSO4 .7H2O.\n\tNOTE: 20X stock solutions can be stored in the refrigerator until use.\nOn the day of the experiment, prepare 2 L of physiological salt solution (PSS) from the 20x concentrated stock solutions as follows: add 100 mL of 20x salt stock to 1,800 mL of deionized water in a 2 L Erlenmeyer flask or beaker on a motorized stirring plate. Add 100 mL of 20x buffer stock while continuously equilibrating the solution with a gas mixture containing 21% O2, 5% CO2, balance N2, and stirring it with a magnetic stirring bar. Slowly add 0.28 g NaH2PO4 while monitoring the pH; adjust as necessary to pH 7.4 by adding drops of 6 N HCl or 6.5 N NaOH solution from a Pasteur pipette. After the PSS is prepared and the pH is adjusted, add 1.98 g of glucose to the PSS.",
    "NOTE: It is important to slowly add the NaH2PO4 last while monitoring the pH of the PSS because the addition of NaH2PO4 to an alkaline solution (pH >7.4) could form a calcium phosphate precipitate, as indicated by the appearance of a cloudy solution or a white precipitate in the bottom of the container.\n\tNOTE: The final composition of the PSS is 119 mM/L NaCl; 4.7 mM/L KCl; 1.17 mM/L Mg2SO4; 1.6 mM/L CaCl2; 1.18 mM/L NaH2PO4; 24 mM/L NaHCO3; 0.03 mM/L EDTA; and 5.5 mM/L glucose. Although the composition of the PSS can differ among laboratories, this recipe is highly suitable for maintaining vascular tone, endothelial function, and responses to vasoactive agents in isolated resistance arteries.\nTo determine the maximum diameter and to assess active tone in the artery by producing maximum dilation of the vessel, prepare 500 mL of Ca2+-free PSS by adding 25 mL of the 20X Ca2+-free salt stock to 450 mL of deionized water, followed by 25 mL of 20x buffer stock in an Erlenmeyer flask or beaker similar to step 1.2 above. Add 0.07 g of NaH2PO4 to the solution while monitoring and adjusting the pH of the solution. The Ca2+-free PSS is added to the PSS reservoir and vessel chamber at the end of the experiment to avoid depleting intracellular Ca2+ stores that could affect vessel responses in normal PSS. Because the Ca2+-free solution is added at the end of the experiment to produce maximum relaxation of the arteries, there is no need to add glucose to the PSS.\n\tNOTE: When complete, the final composition of the Ca2+-free PSS is 120.6 mM/L NaCl; 4.7 mM/L KCl; 1.17 mM/L Mg2SO4; 1.18 mM/L NaH2PO4; 24 mM/L NaHCO3; 0 mM/L CaCl2; and 0.03 mM/L EDTA.",
    "NOTE: For many studies requiring maximum dilation of the artery, a calcium entry blocker such as verapamil (1 µM) and/or a nitric oxide donor such as sodium nitroprusside (10 µM) can be added to the solution, in addition to removing Ca2+ from the PSS.\nMaintain the PO2, PCO2, and pH of the PSS by continuously equilibrating the PSS flowing into the vessel chamber in a standard organ bath used to study isolated aortic rings, intestinal smooth muscle, or other tissues (Figure 1). Use synthetic fluoropolymer of tetrafluoroethylene tubing to connect the gas tank to the organ bath because this type of tubing is gas impermeable, in contrast to many other forms of tubing, e.g., latex.\nPlace a small air stone connected to the equilibration gas mixture in the vessel chamber to help maintain the PSS gas composition.\n\tNOTE: Vessel responses to changes in PO2 can be tested by equilibrating the PSS in the vessel chamber and luminal perfusate with gas mixtures containing various percentages of O2, e.g., 21% O2, 10% O2, 5% O2, and 0% O2, with 5% CO2 and balance N233,34,35. For larger arteries with thicker walls, where diffusion of oxygen into the center of the vessel wall may be a limitation, a higher percentage of oxygen, e.g., 95% O2 can be used.\nMonitor the temperature in the vessel chamber closely, as individual chambers may vary in their heat transfer characteristics.\n\tNOTE: Many commercially-prepared vessel chambers used for studies of cannulated resistance arteries utilize a peristaltic pump to deliver oxygenated PSS from a gas-equilibrated reservoir and provide very precise control of bath temperature and oxygenation of the PSS.",
    "Place the PSS in a large (2 L) Mariotte bottle, with a stopper and central glass tube to serve as a reservoir to continuously deliver PSS into the organ bath that heats and gas-equilibrates the PSS flowing into the vessel chamber (Figure 1A).\nPlace the opening of the central glass tube in the Mariotte bottle at the same level as the top of the PSS in the organ bath, to maintain a constant hydrostatic pressure head for delivery of PSS into the organ bath. Use polyethylene tubing connected to a J-shaped glass or plastic tube to deliver the PSS from the Mariotte bottle into the organ bath.\nFor luminal perfusion (Figure 1A), use polyethylene tubing to connect the inflow pipette to a PSS reservoir composed of a 60 cc plastic syringe elevated to a position that maintains the desired inflow pressure (usually 80 mmHg for studies of rat cerebral arteries), as measured with a pressure transducer connected to the system via a stopcock.\nConnect the outflow pipette to a polyethylene tube to allow the PSS to flow through the vessel in response to a pressure gradient, and connect the outflow line to a reservoir similar to the inflow reservoir. Use a similar stopcock and pressure transducer connection to measure outflow pressure.\n\tNOTE: Procedures for setting transmural pressure and controlling flow through the vessel are described in section 2, below.\nAt the end of the experiment, thoroughly rinse the chamber, delivery lines, and reservoir systems with distilled water. At frequent intervals, replace the tubing and delivery lines, clean or replace the stopcocks in the system, and periodically subject any glass PSS reservoirs to an acid wash to prevent the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms that cause contamination and affect vessel reactivity.\n2. Cannulated Artery Preparation",
    "Anesthetize a Sprague-Dawley rat with 5% isoflurane and maintain the anesthesia using 1.5-2.5% medical grade oxygen36. Alternatively, administer an intramuscular injection containing ketamine (75.0 mg/kg), acepromazine (2.5 mg/kg), and xylazine (10.0 mg/kg); an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (50-60 mg/kg); or any other approved method of anesthesia, depending upon protocols and/or investigator preferences.\nDecapitate the rat under deep anesthesia and remove the brain for studies of cerebral resistance arteries.\nAfter removal of the brain, carefully isolate the middle cerebral artery (MCA) (or other arteries of interest, e.g., basilar artery or posterior cerebral artery)37,38. To isolate the MCAs, place the brain supine in a glass Petri dish filled with ice-cold PSS (Figure 2).\nUse Vannas scissors and a Dumont #5 fine tip forceps to excise the MCA from the brain.  Clean any residual brain tissue from the MCA using the forceps and transfer the artery to a temperature controlled vessel chamber containing PSS as previously described.33,34 .\nTo transfer the artery to the vessel chamber, gently hold the excised vessel by the ACA or the posterior communicating artery segment and carefully place it into the chamber.\n\tNOTE: In addition to the MCA, the cannulated vessel system is suitable for a wide variety of small vessel preparations, including skeletal muscle resistance arteries33,39,40, mesenteric resistance arteries38,41,42, and large (first order) arterioles of the cremaster muscle43, as well as human coronary arterioles and human arterioles obtained from subcutaneous adipose tissue during gluteal biopsy44,45,46,47.",
    "Attach the artery to the inflow micropipette by pulling it toward the pipette base until the tip advances into the lumen of the MCA. Secure the artery on the inflow pipette by tying a loop prepared from a single strand fiber previously teased from 10-0 sutures around the artery (Figure 1B). Secure the opposite end of the MCA to the outflow pipette by tightening a second suture loop around the vessel (Figure 1B).\n\tNOTE: Place the suture loops on the micropipettes prior to mounting the vessel and position them close to the final point of attachment, allowing them to be easily slipped over the artery and quickly secured when the vessel is in position, which minimizes the risk of the artery sliding off the pipettes.\n\tNOTE: Micropipettes are prepared from borosilicate glass capillary tubing (2 mm outer diameter; 1 mm inner diameter; 10 cm long) using a vertical micropipette puller.Prior to attaching the artery, match the tip diameters of the micropipettes as closely as possible to prevent mismatches of inflow and outflow resistance in the perfusion system.\nAfter the artery is securely tied to the micropipettes, use the micrometer connected to the inflow pipette holder to stretch the artery to its in situ length.\nTie off all side branches with single strands teased from 10-0 sutures in order to maintain a constant pressure in the artery.\nVerify the absence of leaks by making sure that the intraluminal (transmural) pressure remains constant after temporarily closing the inflow pipette. Tie off any branches or check for holes in the vessel if the pressure falls. Restore perfusion after verifying that the transmural pressure remains constant.",
    "NOTE: Cannulation of isolated resistance arteries requires manual dexterity and practice. The main precautions to be observed are to avoid breaking the pipettes and to make sure that the artery does not slide off the pipettes. It is important to be gentle with the isolated arteries throughout the entire procedure, as trauma to the vessel can damage the endothelium and/or interfere with normal function of the vascular smooth muscle.\nMeasure the internal diameter of the artery using a video microscopy setup (Figure 1A) consisting of a video camera attached to a dissecting microscope and connected to a video micrometer and television monitor (Figures 1B, 1C). This allows the observer to measure vessel diameters manually by placing movable reference lines on the inner wall of the artery and, if desired, on the outer wall of the artery as well, in order to measure vessel wall thickness.\n\tNOTE: Some video micrometers offer automatic tracking of vessel dimensions.\n\tNOTE: Calibrate the video micrometer with a microscope stage micrometer and the inflow and outflow pressure transducers with a mercury manometer (0 mmHg, 50 mmHg, 100 mmHg, 150 mmHg, and 200 mmHg) between experiments in order to insure accurate measurements of vessel diameter and intraluminal pressure.\n\tNOTE: The standard control transmural pressure for rat MCA experiments is 80 mmHg. Calibration for higher and lower pressure levels assures accuracy for studies of myogenic responses to changes in transmural pressure and passive pressure-diameter curves in maximally dilated arteries.\nAdjust the height of the inflow and outflow reservoirs to maintain the desired transmural pressure at a constant level. Raising the inflow reservoir by a small amount (< 5 mmHg) and lowering the outflow reservoir by the same amount maintains the mean transmural pressure and creates perfusion flow in the vessel lumen6.",
    "NOTE: Raising the inflow reservoir and lowering the outflow reservoir by equal amounts maintains the same mean transmural distending pressure in the artery, but generates a hydrostatic pressure gradient that causes flow and shear stress in the vessel, allowing the investigator to evaluate endothelium-dependent responses to changes in intraluminal shear stress in different experimental groups48.\nTo assess myogenic responses and vessel responses to vasodilator stimuli, make sure that the artery exhibits a suitable level of active tone (approximately 40%) prior to the experiment. Discard any arteries lacking active tone at rest with the exception of vessels, e.g., small mesenteric arteries that do not normally exhibit active resting tone.\n\tNOTE: For vessels that do not normally exhibit spontaneous tone, pre-constrict the arteries by an equivalent amount utilizing a vasoconstrictor agonist such as norepinephrine or phenylephrine. A good approach to choosing the dose of the agonist used to pre-constrict the artery is to utilize an EC50 dose of the vasoconstrictor agent, e.g., norepinephrine41,42. However, pharmacological vasoconstrictor agents should not be applied to arteries that exhibit spontaneous active tone under resting conditions.\nTest endothelium-dependent reactivity of the cannulated resistance artery by measuring vessel diameters during the addition of increasing concentrations of ACh (10-10 M–10-5 M) to the vessel chamber. Test endothelium-independent nitric oxide sensitivity of the vascular smooth muscle by measuring vessel diameters during the addition of increasing concentrations (10-10 M–10-5 M) of the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside to the vessel chamber.\n\tNOTE: Sensitivity to vasoconstrictor agents and other vasodilator agonists can be tested in a similar fashion by adding increasing concentrations of the agonist to the vessel chamber.",
    "NOTE: In addition to vasoactive agents, various drugs, inhibitors, and other pharmacological agents can be added to the tissue bath and/or to the luminal perfusate. Changes in PO2 (as well as PCO2 and pH) can be selectively administered to the endothelial side or the extra-luminal side of the artery by separate equilibration of the luminal perfusate with an air stone connected to a calibrated gas mixture different from the mixture used to equilibrate the PSS in the tissue bath33,34,49. Myogenic responses to changes in transmural pressure can be studied by closing the outflow pipette and raising (or lowering) the height of the PSS reservoir connected to the inflow pipette49,50,51 to increase or reduce intraluminal pressure.\nTo test the role of the endothelium in mediating vessel responses to specific stimuli, remove the vascular endothelium and compare vessel responses to those stimuli in the presence or absence of the endothelium. To remove the endothelium, carefully untie the artery from the outflow pipette and slowly perfuse the lumen of the artery with an air bolus (0.5-1.0 mL). After air perfusion, restore PSS perfusion to clear the cellular debris before re-tying the vessel to the outflow pipette43.\n\tNOTE: Following the endothelial denudation procedure, it is important to verify that the endothelium is removed by testing vascular responses to an agonist (usually ACh) known to produce endothelium dependent vasodilation in that vessel type. However, in certain pathologic conditions, endothelium-dependent vasoconstrictors are released, in which case, it is important to verify that the constrictor response is eliminated following endothelial removal.",
    "At the end of the experiment, determine the maximum diameter of the artery by adding Ca2+-free PSS to the perfusate and superfusate. Calculate active resting tone (%) as((Dmax-Drest)/Dmax) x 100, where Dmax is the maximum diameter in the presence of Ca2+-free solution and Drest is the resting control diameter.\n\tNOTE: Diameter measurements of maximally relaxed arteries in different experimental groups are valuable in comparing active resting tone, structural remodeling (i.e., changes in wall thickness and lumen diameter), and passive mechanical properties (stress-strain relationships calculated from passive diameters at different levels of transmural pressure).\n3. Evaluation of Cerebral Blood Flow Responses with LDF\nAnesthetize the animal with 5% isoflurane and secure the rat in a stereotaxic apparatus9,10.\nMaintain the animal under constant anesthesia while monitoring breathing frequency, end tidal CO2, and depth of anesthesia with a toe pinch36.\nCarefully thin the skull to translucency using a low speed dental drill and mineral oil to provide optical coupling10. Exercise caution to avoid generating excessive heat and to avoid penetrating the bone.\n\tNOTE: Thinning of the skull allows the laser light to reach the underlying tissue and to be reflected back to the probe in order to measure the Doppler shift, the magnitude of which is determined by the number of moving particles (i.e., red blood cells) and their velocity.\nSecure the LDF probe in a micromanipulator and position it directly over the thinned area of the skull. During the experiment, it is very important to prevent movement of either the LDF probe or the preparation itself, as the LDF is designed to measure flow in one restricted area of the tissue and is extremely sensitive to motion artifacts.",
    "NOTE: Any movement of the probe away from its initial position will provide an estimate of blood flow in a different area of the tissue, precluding comparisons. While LDF does not provide absolute flow values and is not suitable for comparison between subjects, it is an excellent way to noninvasively evaluate changes in tissue perfusion in response to experimental interventions in individual subjects; and relative changes in LDF signal from control values can be averaged and compared to changes in LDF signal from control in other experimental groups.\n\tNOTE: LDF is a convenient approach to gain insight into factors regulating blood flow at the level of the whole vascular bed in different experimental groups8,9,10. Evaluation of tissue perfusion with LDF provides a practical approach to assimilate knowledge gained from isolated vessel studies into a whole bed perspective. Barring regional differences in vascular control mechanisms between resistance arteries and the microcirculation, measurements obtained with LDF provide a good indication of tissue blood flow control that is generally consistent with results obtained with cannulated artery preparations.\n4. Evaluation of Skeletal Muscle Microvessel Density with GS1 Lectin\nRemove the cremaster muscle from a male rat by cutting open the scrotum with standard fine surgical scissors and then using a Dumont #5 forceps to grasp the muscle.\n\tNOTE: Thin muscles (e.g., the cremaster muscle, as well as the extensor digitorum longus and tibialis anterior muscles that are found in both male and female rats) are ideally suited for use as whole mounts for lectin studies, although histological sections can be used for thicker tissues.",
    "Remove the cremaster muscle from the testicle using a single cut. Place it in ice-cold PSS and pin it out in a Petri Dish with a silicone elastomer lining on the bottom inside surface. Gently tease away connective tissue using Dumont #5 forceps.\nRinse the muscle samples with 2 mL of buffered PSS and then immerse them in rhodamine-labeled GS1 lectin (20 µg/mL PSS) for 50 min in a 12-well cell culture plate with 2 mL/well that is wrapped in aluminum foil to exclude light.\nRemove the tissues from the lectin solution, rinse them three times in PSS with 5 min \"wash\" incubations on a rocker, and mount them on microscope slides. Make sure to incubate the tissues in the dark and store the slides in the dark to prevent loss of fluorescence.\n\tNOTE: If the slides cannot be used immediately, they can be kept in the refrigerator with no loss of fluorescence. For prolonged storage, the slides can be kept in a freezer to prevent deterioration11.\nEvaluate microvessel density by counting the number of intersections of the labeled microvessels with computer-generated grid lines superimposed over the image52, or with a clear grid overlay superimposed over the monitor being used to view the slides.",
    "NOTE: GS1 lectin approaches have been used to demonstrate: salt-induced microvascular rarefaction53, the protective effect of preventing salt induced angiotensin II suppression in restoring microvessel density in salt-fed animals17,53,54; the role of NRF2 mediating the protective effect of low dose angiotensin II infusion to prevent microvessel rarefaction in salt-fed rats17; and also to evaluate the role of angiotensin II in maintaining angiogenic responses to chronic muscle stimulation in salt fed rats54,55. One advantage of the GS1 lectin technique is that it can be used to assess microvessel density in the same animals used for studies of cannulated resistance arteries or LDF.\nSubscription Required.
