    "The experiments were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.The experiments were performed following the recommendations of the Declarations of Helsinki and Tokyo and the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the European Community. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 300-350 g, were used in the present study. The animals were housed at a room temperature of 22 °C ± 1 °C and a humidity of 40%-60% with light-dark cycles.\n1. Animal preparation\nSelect at random 30 adult male rats, and divide them into two groups: TBI and sham.\nProvide chow (see the Table of Materials) and water ad libitum.\n\tNOTE: Perform all the steps of the test at the same time to control for the effect of time of day on behavioral performance. It is best to conduct the behavior tests in the morning (between 6:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m.) to avoid disturbance from general activity.\nPerform baseline assessments of the neurological severity score before injury in both groups of rats, as detailed in step 3 and Table 1.\nAnesthetize the rats with 4% (for induction) and 1.5% (for maintenance) isoflurane. Inject Buprenorphine (0.05-0.1 mg/kg; SC) for preemptive analgesia.\nCheck for the immobilization of the rat by testing for a lack of movement or pedal reflex in response to a stimulant.\n\tNOTE: For anesthesia administration, a continuous flow of isoflurane is recommended.\n2. Surgical procedure\nNOTE: All procedures are to be performed in aseptic conditions. Use sterile gloves. Change the gloves if any non-sterile surface is touched. Apply ophthalmic lubricant to both eyes to prevent drying. The parasagittal fluid-percussion injury was performed following previously published reports18,20.\nInfiltrate the scalp with 0.5% bupivacaine (see the Table of Materials), perform a 10 mm incision, and retract the tissues laterally.",
    "Perform craniotomy18,20 4 mm posterior and 4 mm lateral of bregma.\n\tNOTE: The surgical area must be disinfected several times in a circular motion with both an iodine-based or chlorhexidine-based scrub and alcohol. \nInduce TBI18,19 by a fluid-percussion device (see the Table of Materials) over 21-23 ms through the three-way stopcock.\n\tNOTE: Perform moderate TBI with an amplitude of 2.5 atm.\nPerform craniotomy on the group of sham-operated rats (Figure 1). Do not induce TBI for the sham-operated group.\nPerform 0.1% bupivacaine infiltration before closing the wound. Administer intramuscular buprenorphine (0.01-0.05 mg/kg) as postoperative analgesia before withdrawing the isoflurane.\n\tNOTE: Repeat doses of buprenorphine every 12 h for at least 48 h.\nTransfer the rat to the recovery room, and monitor its respiratory (e.g., respiratory arrest), neurological (e.g., paralysis), and cardiovascular state (e.g., changes in the color of pupils, decreases in soft tissue perfusion, and bradycardia) for 24 h.\n3. Neurological severity score evaluation\nNOTE: The highest possible score for behavioral alterations and motor function is 24 points. A score of 0 represents intact neurological status, and a score of 24 represents severe neurological dysfunction21,22,23 (Table 1).\nEvaluate the neurological severity score (NSS) as previously described24 on the TBI and sham rats before surgery, at 48 h after surgery (Figure 2A), and on day 28 after surgery (Figure 2B).\n4. Studying the dominant- submissive behavior\nRandomly divide the rats into cages 1 week before the test.\n\tNOTE: Each cage should contain one sham-operated rat and one TBI rat.\nPerform one 15 min session every day for 2 days before testing so that rats can acclimate to the protocol.\n\tNOTE: The dominant-submissive task was initiated on day 29 after injury (Figure 1).",
    "Use an apparatus (see the Table of Materials) made from two transparent acrylic glass boxes (30 cm x 20 cm x 20 cm, Box A and Box B, Figure 3) connected by a slender 15 cm x 15 cm x 60 cm tunnel15,19,25.\nFill a feeder (Figure 3) with sweetened milk, and place it at the tunnel's center. Use milk consisting of 10% sugar and 3% fat.\nPlace the apparatus on a table with a height of 80 cm above the floor.\nPlace each rat in the apparatus for 15 min for habituation on the first 2 days. Start the task after 2 habituation days.\nRandomly select one rat from the control group and one from the traumatic brain injury (TBI) group, and set them at equal distances from the feeder, allowing them to explore for 5 min.\nAllow the rats access to water ad libitum.\n\tNOTE: The task lasted for 5 days. Food restriction was performed for the entire task period. The food was given every day for 1 h after the test period.\nClean the equipment with 5% alcohol before performing the subsequent tests with other rats.\n\t​NOTE: Cleaning the apparatus will eliminate the smell of the previous rats. Perform the test in a room with proper air circulation.\n5. Recording the video and data analysis\nPosition a camera, and install the recommended computer software (see the Table of Materials) to capture, save, and process the data.\n\tNOTE: The camera needs to be installed at a height of 290 cm from the floor.\nRecord the video while the rats are in the arena.\n\tNOTE: The camera and the apparatus were positioned 210 cm apart. The part of the arena where the test is conducted must be visible in the camera frame.",
