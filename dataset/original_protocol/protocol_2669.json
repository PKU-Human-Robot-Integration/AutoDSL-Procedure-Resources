    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAssessment of mitochondrial complex stability\nTiming: 2 h\nThe following steps utilize calorimetry to conclude mitochondria complex stability for confirmation of steroidogenic ability. To determine whether the desired mitochondrial complex is viable, it will be confirmed via isothermal calorimetry to evaluate the enthalpy of the initiated reaction. Using the knowledge acquired pertaining to the mitochondrial ETC complex of interest, defining the stability of the complex is the first step in determining the ETC complex’s vital role in metabolism.\nCritical: The samples tested in the following steps must be from the same, uniform isolated mitochondrial preparation. Use of a confluent sample throughout the protocol is essential to eliminate potential bias or discrepancies in supporting data.\nCritical: All buffers should be prepared in degassed water and prefiltered through 0.22 μm to reduce inconsistencies in calorimetry data.\nNote: Mitochondrial preparation must be kept on ice between steps to preserve full metabolic activity.\nPrepare mitochondrial samples for calorimetric experiment.\nThaw all samples at 4°C for 15 min.\nTransfer samples to calorimeter chamber.\nNote: Within calorimeter, there are 2 chambers that will contain mitochondrial protein sample, one that will be tested and one for a constant allowing for comparison in heat production.\nResuspend 100 μL of mitochondrial sample (1 μg/μL) in 1.5 mL of mitochondria isolation buffer containing 1 mM ATP.\nPlace 20 μL of mitochondrial protein suspension into each enclosed chamber of the isothermal calorimeter (ITC).\nNote: Isothermal calorimeter has two independent, enclosed cells (also called chambers) and is equipped with an automatic injector. The reason for utilizing both chambers is to have a control data point used when calculating change in heat. All steps following that involve addition of substrates will pertain to tested chamber.",
    "Gradually increase heat in calorimeter every 15 min until the sample has reached 37°C prior to proceeding to next step.\nInject 5 μL of succinate at a speed of 0.5 μL/s into calorimeter in 7-min intervals.\nMeasure heat content reading following each interval.\nContinue step above describing 5 μL succinate injection every 7 min until the heat content (ΔH) readings show minimal variation in data points resembling a plateau.\nRepeat measurements 3 times for all data points acquired.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2324-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Isothermal titration calorimetry data interpretation with raw data obtained assessing mitochondrial ETC complex stability\nTitration of succinate was continued until the enthalpy (ΔH) remained unchanged signifying full saturation of the enzyme. When enthalpy is expressed visually (as shown), the amount of succinate required to reach maximum saturation can be determined and utilized in later steps throughout the procedure. Software built into the calorimeter (MicroCal) was used to calculate ΔH. Data from Bose et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nNote: Measurements will show a resemblance in the pattern of data points, independent to data values, depicted in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]. The amount of succinate injected, heat content readings, and number of data points required to reach plateau phase may vary depending on samples used. The graph provided in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] exemplifies the correct data trend supporting the point of full enzymatic saturation and stability. The amount of succinate required to reach plateau phase will be used in later steps as a guide assess ETC complex metabolic capacity. See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nRepeat measurements three times for all data points acquired.\nCalculate enthalpy (ΔH) for each interval by dividing power generated by the reaction with the corresponding concentration. ΔH = ΔG – TΔS.",
    "Note: G = free energy; T = temperature; S = entropy; H = enthalpy. Enthalpy calculation will yield either a positive or negative value. Negative values signify stability of the assessed reaction while positive values correspond to increased reactivity and less stability. Data calculation was performed via software that was preinstalled on calorimeter system from MicroCal, but calculations may be done manually yielding the same results.\nNote: Once ΔH begins to plateau, Vmax has been reached signifying full enzymatic saturation and consumption of available substrates within mitochondria. At this point, the complex has reached peak stabilization in association with enzymatic saturation and succinate concentration. See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nOptional: If desired, repeat beginning at step 2 above with mitoplast substituted for mitochondria sample as a negative constant.\nMeasurement of mitochondrial complex activity via RIA and conjugate calorimetry\nTiming: 8–10 h",
    "This section includes steps of combined calorimetry and steroidogenic activity assay. It was unknown which substrates and cofactors were essential in the stabilization of ETC complex II and its role in regulating steroid metabolism by SCC protein folding. By determining the enthalpy in various combinations of known substrates/cofactors including succinate, mitochondria, mitoplast, and ATP, the possibility to conclude which compounds aid in ETC complex II stabilization became attainable. The difference in required substrates and cofactors for various samples may vary allowing for substitution for compounds of interest. The process of determining which substrates and/or cofactors are necessary for the stabilization of ETC complex II are explained as an optional step below. The enzymatic substrate assay revealed the essential component in stabilizing the reaction being succinate; however, the question of whether the confirmed substrates regulate enzymatic activity remained. The following steps are designed to measure products of downstream reactions to confirm metabolic capabilities. For this protocol, the conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone, which is an early reaction in steroidogenesis, was measured to confirm intact enzymatic activity (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2324-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic illustration and example of data for measuring enthalpy and pregnenolone synthesized during ETC complex II formation\nDepicted is a technique using a combined calorimetry experiment paralleled to a metabolic activity assay. [Data from Bose et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]].\n(A) Illustration provided to emphasize the technique in maintaining corresponding samples for calorimetry and RIA independently. Samples were created in centrifuge tubes for each amount of succinate titrated into the calorimeter for activity measurement via RIA.\n(B) To conclude which substrates were required to stabilize ETC complex II, the enthalpy was acquired in the presence and absences of hypothesized substrates/cofactors.",
    "(C) RIA results and relative trend of activity measured. Procedure to perform RIA is available from MP Biomedicals Protocol references. Data is correlated with results obtained from enthalpy measurements to determine the capacity of succinate in ETC SCC-associated complex II steroid metabolism.\nNote: The mitochondrial protein solution used in this step is the same solution used in steps 1–8 and for all future steps.\nPrepare calorimeter by adding a fixed 20 μL of mitochondrial sample to isothermal calorimeter.\nIncubate at 37°C for 1 h.\nAdd 2 μL of 10 mM ATP into calorimeter.\nWait for 30 min following this addition and record enthalpy.\nThis is the first data point for this portion of the protocol.\nTitrate each time with 1 μL of 50 mM of succinate into calorimeter.\nWait 2 min after each addition.\nDocument enthalpy of the reaction.\nContinue titration until enthalpy is unchanged.\nNote: Amount of added succinate may vary and is dependent on the results acquired from step 8. The amount of substrate added in step 12 will exceed the amount of substrate required to reach maximum reaction stabilization resembled as plateau phase depicted in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nRepeat succinate titration in the previous step until enthalpy begins to increase signifying loss of ETC complex stabilization.\nPause point: If the reaction is continually producing a positive value of ΔH, reassess necessary substrate concentration needed to reach stabilization calculated in step 6. This is a good point to explore hypothesized substrates and/or cofactors that may be a limiting factor in complex stability. See troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7].",
    "Optional: Test combinations of substrates by removing and/or adding different compounds in steps 11 and 12. Resulting ΔH measurement will signify the enzymatic requirement for stability. This step is not essential if the substrates and cofactors are known for mitochondrial stability and functionality; however, this step provides opportunity to test unknown substrates and their contributions to the enzymatic reaction being investigated.\nNote: At this point in the protocol, the goal is to prepare samples for RIA identical to sample conditions observed in steps 9–13. By doing so, it is important to recall the number of titrations performed. This number plus 1 is the number of tubes that must be prepared and labeled. The “plus 1” accounts for the enthalpy of the initial mitochondria protein sample.\nLabel tubes 1 through Xn equivalent to the number of titrations performed in previous step for RIA preparation.\nNote: For explanation, if 30 data points were obtained from calorimetry above, tubes should be labeled 1–30.\nAdd 20 μL of mitochondrial sample to each labeled tube.\nAdd 1 μL of 50 mM succinate independently to labeled tubes increasing amount by 1 μL each addition in correspondence to total succinate titrated at each data point.\nThe first tube labeled tube should not contain succinate and will be correlated to data point “time 0” of the calorimetry data collected. The amount of succinate added to the second labeled tube will correspond to the data point obtained after the first titration of 1 μL of succinate in above calorimetry. In the third labeled tube, 2 μL of succinate is added in correspondence to the third data point in the calorimetry performed and so on.",
    "Note: At this point in the procedure, the RIA samples in labeled tubes must be identical to the amount of succinate added at each data point in calorimetry. Since the sample amount in the calorimeter is fixed, the amount of succinate continues to increase with each data point; however, the succinate in the sample used for RIA will be unchanged.\nFollowing the addition of succinate to each independent tube, add 1–2 μL of 100 mM concentration of Trilostane.\nImmediately following additions, transfer to a 37°C water bath for 2 h.\nThe incubation time is independent for each labeled tube and must be maintained precisely.\nCentrifuge at 3,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C–8°C.\nCollect supernatant from each tube independently for RIA beginning at step 20 below.\nNote: If RIA to determine ETC complex activity and metabolic conversion is not performed immediately following step 19, the supernatant must be stored at −86°C and gradually thawed on ice prior to starting RIA experiment. Trilostane is soluble in Ethanol and stops further conversion.\nDirect measurement of progesterone by radioimmunoassay\nTiming: 2–3 h\nIn this procedure, we used radioimmunoassay (RIA) for a quantitative analysis of the enzymatic activity. The antibody used to determine activity may vary depending on the target product downstream for the reaction of interest. When performing RIA for specific compounds, use caution and proper PPE with radioactive components. Protocol for RIA provided by MP Biomedicals and additionally listed in “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]” section.",
    "Note: All samples must remain on ice throughout completion of metabolic reactions. RIA counting may produce variations in results due to static on scintillation vials thus ensure to allow sufficient time to decrease outliers. RIA procedure may differ depending on target product synthesized. If the radiolabeled product differs, interpretation of the data remains consistent and is discussed in “quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis]” section.\nTo measure the conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone, use the supernatant obtained in step 19 for RIA procedure provided by MP Biomedicals. See troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9].\nOptional: After the ETC complex activity has been determined by RIA above, thin layer chromatography (TLC) was used to further confirm the conversion studied throughout the protocol. This is an additional confirmatory step and not required. Confirmation of enzymatic products may be performed in ways other than TLC; therefore, we have provided key points for TLC as this is a widely used method in the scientific field. To initiate the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, incubation of isolated mitochondrial protein sample and a significant amount of cholesterol must be done. Essential substrates of the desired metabolic reaction must also be added during the incubation process. Stopping the conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone is accomplished by incubation with Trilostane, which is an inhibitor of 3-βhydroxy steroid dehydrogenase. Following incubation, extraction of steroids/metabolites is performed allowing for the analysis of conversion via TLC."
