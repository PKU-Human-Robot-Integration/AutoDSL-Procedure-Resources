    "1. Teflon block preparation\nPrepare the Teflon block from chemical-resistant PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) resin. Make holes on the block using a general drill followed by the dimensions labeled in Figure 1.\n2. Monolayer lipid preparation\nNOTE: Estimated operating time: 30- 45 minutes\nLipid stock preparation\n\t\nPrepare a 0.01 mg/mL lipid mixture in 9:1 (v/v) chloroform/methanol using 8.91 mL of chloroform, 0.99 mL of methanol and 0.01 mL of 10 mg/mL lipids.\nTeflon plate preparation\n\t\nSonicate a Teflon plate in a methanol bath for 5 minutes.\nWash with hot water for 15 minutes.\nRinse with distilled water.\nDry the Teflon plate in a desiccator for 30 minutes and keep it under vacuum when not in use (Figure 1).\n3. Formation of lipid monolayer on buffer reservoir\nNOTE: Estimated operating time: 1.5 hours\nFreshly prepare a lipid mixture of 0.01 mg/mL in a 9:1 mixture of chloroform/methanol on the day of the experiment.\nPlace a Type-1 filter paper in a Petri dish and arrange the Teflon block on top of the filter paper.\nFill the wells of the Teflon plate with 60 µL of the buffer.\nCarefully add lipid mixture on top of the buffer surface drop by drop (ideally 1 µL per drop) using a Hamilton syringe.\nWet the filter paper with distilled water to keep humidity in the Petri dish.\nIncubate at room temperature for 60 minutes. The chloroform should evaporate, and a monolayer of lipid on the surface of the buffer should be formed.\n4. Application of an EM grid on a lipid monolayer\nNOTE: Estimated operating time: 1.5 hours\nGently place a holey carbon-coated EM grid without glow-discharging, carbon side down, onto the top of each buffer reservoir.",
    "Carefully inject proteins into the side injection well. Use final protein concentrations in the well around 1 µM of protein as a starting point. Pre-optimize the protein concentration before the experiment.\nIncubate for 60 minutes at room temperature.\nGently inject approximately 20-30 µL of buffer into the side injection port. This will raise the grid above the surface of the Teflon block.\nImmediately pick up the grid with a tweezer and lift it vertically off the droplet.\nPrepare monolayer samples for negative staining or cryo-TEM imaging (Figure 2). If the proteins form a 2D array, the image power spectrum or Fourier periodogram will show diffraction intensities at the spatial frequencies based on the crystal symmetry. If no diffraction spots are shown in the power spectrum, the proteins are unlikely to form a 2D crystal.\nCheck the coverage of the lipid monolayer on the EM grid using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). A lower-magnified electron image is helpful to identify the morphology of the covered monolayer. Usually, the image contrast of the monolayer-covered area will be slightly lower than that of the uncovered areas. In addition, the computed 2D image power spectrum will help identify the location of the 2D crystalline.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
