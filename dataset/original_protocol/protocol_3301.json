    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIn vitro transcription of Cas9 mRNA – Day 1\nTiming: 8 h\n      Cas9 expression plasmid was linearized and Cas9 mRNA was\n      in vitro transcribed, purified and then quality inspected by\n      electrophoresis.\n    \nPlasmid linearization\n        Check the map of plasmid which will be used as the DNA template and\n        chose proper digestion enzyme to linearize this plasmid. Any plasmid\n        expressing the Cas9 or Cas9-fusion with a T7 promoter can be used, such\n        as AddGene plasmid #101178 , #183194 etc.\n      \n        Based the chosen enzyme, determining the information below:\n        \nrecommended digestion buffer.\nrecommended plasmid amount (optimally: 8000 ng).\nrecommended reaction incubation time and temperature.\n        Run the digestion reaction according to the information obtained from\n        above (Step-2).\n      \nNote: Here is an example reaction for\n      using MssI to digest Cas9wt plasmid\n    \ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3069_4.csv\nReaction Condition: incubate at 37°C, 15 min\nRun agarose gel to check linearization quality and product size.\nmRNA in vitro transcription\n        Thaw the necessary kit (HiScribe T7 ARCA mRNA Kit (with tailing))\n        components, mix and pulse-spin in microfuge to collect solutions to the\n        bottoms of tubes.\n      \n        For each linearized plasmid, take 1μg and assemble the reaction in the\n        following order in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube:\n      \ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3069_5.csv\n        Mix thoroughly and pulse-spin in a microfuge. Incubate at 37°C on heat\n        block for 30 min.\n      \nPause point: the reaction can be\n      stored at –20°C for one week.\n    \nNote: Reaction time depends on template\n      amount, quality, and RNA transcript length. For reactions with transcripts\n      longer than 0.5 kb, 30 min incubation should give the maximum yield.\n    \n        To remove the DNA template, add 2 μL of DNase I to each tube from\n        pervious step (step 7). Mix well and incubate at 37°C for 15 min.\n      \nNote: Keep the DNase I on the ice or in\n      the freezing rack.",
    "Optional: If desired, save 1 μL for\n      gel analysis.\n    \nNote: Do not heat the reaction or purify\n      the RNA in this step and continue to proceed to the tailing reaction (step\n      9).\n    \n        The Poly(A) tailing reaction can be set up as below in each tube from\n        the previous step (step 8):\n      \ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3069_6.csv\nNote: Keep the PolyA polymerase on the ice\n      or in the freezing rack.\n    \nNote: The unpurified IVT reaction contains\n      enough ATP, no extra ATP is necessary for the tailing reaction. Standard\n      tailing reaction volume is 50 μL.\n    \n        Mix thoroughly and pulse-spin in a microfuge. Incubate at 37°C for\n        30 min. Save 1 μL for analysis if necessary.\n      \nmRNA purification by LiCl precipitation\n        Add 25 μL of LiCl solution (7.5 M Lithium Chloride, 50 mM EDTA) to the\n        50 μL transcription reaction, and mix well. The final concentration of\n        LiCl in the RNA solution is 2.5 M.\n      \n        Incubate at –20°C for 30 min or longer. If needed, keep it overnight\n        at –20°C.\n      \n        Centrifuge at 4°C for 15 min at top speed (>12000rpm) of a\n        microcentrifuge to pellet the RNA.\n      \n        Remove the supernatant carefully. Rinse the pellet by slowly adding\n        500 μL of ice-cold 70% ethanol to remove residual salt, and then\n        centrifuge at 4°C for 10 min.\n      \n        Remove the ethanol carefully. Spin the tube briefly to bring down any\n        liquid on the wall. Remove any residual liquid carefully with a sharp\n        pipette tip (e.g., 10μL).\n      \n        Air dry the pellet – a white or transparent pellet of the RNA will form\n        within few minutes (do not dry more than 10 min).\n      \n        Resuspend the mRNA in nuclease-free water. Make aliquots in PCR tubes,\n        label and store the mRNA at –20°C (less than 6 months) or –80°C (more\n        than 6 months).\n      \nPause point: the reaction can be",
    "stored at –20°C for a short time before run mRNA electrophoresis.\n    \nmRNA electrophoresis\n      This is a quality control step for the in vitro transcribed mRNA,\n      in order to check if the size of the mRNA is correct, and if any mRNA\n      degradation happened, thus this step is highly recommended. An RNA\n      integrity number (RIN) with a Bioanalyzer is also recommended.\n    \n        Prepare the denaturing gel:\n        \n            add 1 g agarose in 72 mL water and heat until dissolved, then cool\n            to 60°C.\n          \n            In the fume hood, add 10 mL 10× MOPS running buffer and 18 mL 37%\n            formaldehyde (12.3 M) to the agarose.\n          \n            Mix gently but thoroughly by inverting the bottle several times. Do\n            not introduce bubbles in the melted mixture.\n            \nCritical: Formaldehyde is\n              toxic through skin contact and inhalation of vapors. Manipulations\n              involving formaldehyde should be done in a chemical fume hood.\n            \n            In the fume hood: Pour the gel into the plastic chamber and insert\n            the gel comb. Use a comb that will form wells large enough to\n            accommodate at least 25 μL.\n            \nNote: If you see any bubbles\n              formed, remove then by poking them with a small pipette tip. Let\n              the gel solidify for at least 2 h in the fume hood.\n            \n            Assemble the gel in the tank and add enough 1× MOPS running buffer\n            to cover the gel.\n            \nNote: Normally, the gel solidified\n              in 30 min to 1 h. Do not let the gel dry out in the hood. Then\n              remove the comb.\n            \n        Prepare the mRNA sample:\n        \n            Add no more than 5 μL of the sample RNA to a 1.5-mL microcentrifuge\n            tube. Add 3 volumes of Formaldehyde Load Dye to the sample RNA.\n            \nNote: Each tube should typically\n              contain 0.5–2 μg of poly(A)+ mRNA. If the volume of the sample RNA",
    "is larger than 5 μL, first precipitate the RNA and resuspend in a\n              smaller volume.\n            \n            Incubate the samples for 15 min in a 65°C water bath to denature any\n            RNA secondary structure. Briefly spin down samples in a\n            microcentrifuge and place on ice.\n          \n            Add 0.5 μL ethidium bromide to the samples to visualize the RNA\n            directly during and after electrophoresis.\n            \n                Load the samples on a denaturing formaldehyde agarose gel using\n                RNase-free pipette tips.\n                \nNote: To keep the samples as\n                  dense as possible, make sure there is no air trapped in the\n                  end of the pipette tip.\n                \nPlace the tip just inside the top of the well.\nExpel the sample slowly.\n                Gently raise the tip out of the well.\n                \nNote: Remember to record the\n                  well number and corresponding sample name.\n                \nCritical: Ethidium bromide\n                  is a mutagenic compound that intercalates double-stranded DNA\n                  and RNA. Wear protective gloves, clothing, and eye/face\n                  protection when handling.\n                \nNote: Ethidium bromide can be\n                  replaced by SYBR Safe Stain from Invitrogen. SYBR Safe Stain\n                  is specifically formulated to be a less hazardous alternative\n                  to ethidium bromide and it can be viewed with blue-light or by\n                  UV excitation. The stain is also suitable for staining RNA in\n                  gels, and in our experience, when using SYBR Safe Stain, the\n                  resolution of the gel is slightly worse than using ethidium\n                  bromide.\n                \n        Run the gel:\n        \n            Load the RNA size markers on the gel and run gel with 10V voltage\n            per centimeter of distance between electrodes.\n            \nNote: In general, stop\n              electrophoresis when the bromophenol blue dye front (corresponding\n              to approximately 500 nt) has migrated approximately 3/4 the length\n              of the gel. (Usually 1–2 h)\n            \n            Use a computer-controlled CCD camera system with a UV\n            transilluminator to photograph the gel.\n            \nNote: Any gel imaging system with",
    "ultraviolet (UV) light between wavelength 300 and 360 nm can be\n              used to photograph the gel, for the ethidium bromide has UV\n              absorbance maxima at this wavelength range.\n            \nCritical: Agarose gel\n              containing formaldehyde are always handled and run in the chemical\n              hood\n            \n      Editing fibroblast with Cas9 mRNA electroporation transfection – Day 2–6\n    \nTiming: 4–5 h\n      Cultured fibroblasts are electroporated with in vitro transcribed\n      Cas9 mRNA and other related editing components - sgRNA and ssDNA repair\n      template.\n    \nNote: Transfection results may be donor\n      dependent. Culture conditions may differ between cell types. Please follow\n      your established procedure or the supplier’s recommendations.\n    \nNote: It's critical to use sgRNA, not\n      crRNA-tracrRNA hybrids as the latter won't work.\n    \nNote: The average HDR editing levels that\n      can be reached with the protocol and using of CleanCap mRNA gives somewhat\n      higher editing levels.

    "Add pre-warmed cell culture medium up to 30mL and pipette up and down\n        using a 25mL pipette. Check under microscope for cell presence.\n      \n        Transfer cell suspension into a 50mL Falcon tube and centrifuge at 300×g\n        (relative centrifugal force, RCF) for 5min.\n      \n        Discard supernatant and first resuspend cell pellet in 1000μL pre-warmed\n        cell culture medium using a 1000μL pipette, then fill up to 10mL with\n        pre-warmed cell culture medium.

Record\n            cell viability and amount of living cells/mL.\n          \nNote: Be as gentle as possible with cells\n      and avoid vigorous pipetting.\n    \nTake the required volume of the cells for electroporation.\n        Prepare mRNAs, sgRNA and ssDNA repair template and Cas9WT RNP in 96-well\n        PCR plate.\n        \n            Take out the Cas9 RNAs out from −80°C (or –20°C) and place it on\n            ice.\n          \n            Take out the sgRNA(s) and ssDNA repair template(s) and place on ice.\n            Let thaw completely.\n          \n            Place a sterile 96-well plate into the hood and pipette 1 μL of\n            target gene sgRNA (100 μM) into each needed well for electroporation\n            (for the test group(s) and control group(s)).\n          \n            Next, pipette 1 μL of IDT Cas9WT protein (60 μM) (used for positive\n            control) into the wells (wells already added sgRNA from Step 29-c)\n            going to be used for electroporation to form RNPs.\n            \n                Cover the plate with tinfoil, briefly spin, and mix gently with\n                a pen scrapping over the bottom of the 96-well plate.\n              \n                Place into the bench at room temperature (around 20°C–30°C) and\n                let incubate for 15 min.\n              \n                After that, place on ice.\n                \nNote: Prepare Cas9WT RNP wells\n                  as positive control at this step.\n                \n            Then, add 1 μL of ssODN repair template (100μM) for the editing\n            locus into each well containing RNPs (positive control) or",
    "containing sgRNA only (test group, will add Cas9 in mRNA format\n            later). Cover with foil again, place on ice until use.\n            \nNote: mRNA will be added later to\n              avoid degradation.\n            \n        Spin the cells for 5 min at 300g. Remove supernatant, add 30mL of warm\n        PBS, wash gently and spin once more for 5 min at 300g. Remove the PBS\n        and resuspend in an appropriate volume of electroporation buffer\n        (20μL/well).

Keep the plate on a\n        cooling rack (4°C).\n      \n        Pipette the mRNAs onto corresponding test wells at this step. Use 100μL\n        pipette mix once before loading into the electroporation strip.\n      \nNote: Use ethanol and RNase Away spray to\n      clean the hood environment to sure sterility of the mRNA.\n    \n        Load 20μL into corresponding wells of the electroporation\n        strip(s)/plate(s).

GUIDE-seq (genome-wide, unbiased identification of DSBs\n      enabled by sequencing) provides us with a genome-wide, unbiased,\n      in vitro detection method to detect the off-target effect of living\n      cells by sequencing.\n    \nNote: an optimized GUIDE-seq method can be\n      used in various cell types, such as primary human T cells including\n      patient-specific variants, and is capable of identifying off-target\n      cleavage/gene editing sites in a highly sensitive, unbiased, and\n      genome-wide manner.\n    \n        Optimize the dsODN concentration.\n        \nNote: GUIDE-seq requires the\n          transfection of double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (dsODN) into\n          cells. Considering that different cell types have different tolerances\n          to dsODN, for example, high concentration of dsODN are required for\n          certain transfection refractory cells, and low concentration are\n          needed for many primary cells sensitive to cytotoxic from the dsODN,\n          therefore, the concentration of dsODN must be optimized according to\n          the cell type.\n        \nNote: The blunt-ended dsODN used in\n          our GUIDE-seq experiments was the same as used in the original\n          GUIDE-seq paper (Tsai et al., 2015), and prepared by annealing (in the\n          same way as annealing the Y adapter) two modified oligonucleotides of\n          the following compositions:\n        \n        5ʹ- P-G∗T∗TTAATTGAGTTGTCATATGTTAATAACGGT∗A∗T -3ʹ and,\n        5ʹ- P-A∗T∗ACCGTTATTAACATATGACAACTCAATTAA∗A∗C -3ʹ. (Where P represents a",
    "5ʹ phosphorylation and ∗ indicates a phosphorothioate linkage.)\n        \nNote: To optimize the dsODN\n          concentration, two Affinity Plus (IDT) probes were designed for dsODN\n          used in GUIDE-seq, and the sequences of the two probes are:\n        \n        dsODN probe-fwd: /5HEX/TT + G + A + G+TTG+T+CATATGT/3IABkFQ/ and,\n        dsODN probe-rev: /5HEX/ACATATG+A+CAA+C+T + C + AA/3IABkFQ/, These two\n        probes use “HEX” as the 5′ reporter dye and “Iowa Black FQ” as the 3′\n        Quencher.

Both forward and reverse probes work well in the\n        ddPCR experiments.\n        \n            The dsODN concentration optimization steps start with testing the\n            different amounts of dsODN in cells undergoing CRISPR-Cas9 editing.\n            \nNote: For optimization of dsODN\n              concentration, both the amount of dsODN added and the volume of\n              the electroporation transfection buffer system need to be\n              considered. In our experiment setting, the proper concentration of\n              dsODN after the test is 1 μM (20pmol in 20 μL electroporation\n              transfection buffer), while in the original paper [Tsai, S. et al.\n              2015], the concentration of dsODN used in U2OS cells is 5 μM\n              (100pmol in 20 μL buffer), and in HEK293 cells is 0,25 μM (5pmol\n              in 20 μL buffer).\n            \nNote: first, the dsODN is provided\n              at the amount ranging from about 1 pmol to about 10 nmol to the\n              cells (the specific range depends on cell types) during\n              electroporation (step 22–39), and the cell viability was monitored\n              every day after the dsODN transfection until the samples are\n              harvested.\n            \n            When editing fibroblast with Cas9 mRNA electroporation transfection\n            (day-2), add the dsODN in wells which will be used as to check the\n            off-target profile. dsODN should be added together with other",
