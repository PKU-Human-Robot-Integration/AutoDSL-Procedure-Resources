    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nNote: The protocol for construction of cDNA libraries in CapZyme-seq enables single-nucleotide-resolution analysis of RNA 5′ ends. In particular, single-stranded oligonucleotide adapters are ligated to RNA 5′ ends and the 5′-adapter-ligated products are used as templates for generation of cDNAs that are analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. For each sequencing read, the precise identification of the RNA 5′ end sequence is accomplished by using the sequence of the 3′ end of the 5′ adapter as a point of reference.\nEnzymatic Treatments of RNA\nTiming: ∼1-2 h\nCapZyme-seq relies on ligation of single-stranded oligonucleotide adapters to RNA 5′ ends prior to cDNA synthesis. This ligation step requires that the RNA have a 5′-monophosphate. Thus, analysis of RNAs without a 5′-monophosphate requires enzymatic processing of the RNAs to yield RNAs having a 5′-monophosphate. In CapZyme-seq the processing enzymes NudC and Rai1, which are specific for NCIN-capped RNA, along with RNA 5′ polyphosphatase (Rpp), a processing enzyme specific for uncapped, 5′-triphosphate RNA, are employed to enable differential detection and quantitation of NCIN-capped RNA and uncapped, 5′-triphosphate RNA.",
    "For selective processing of NCIN-capped RNA to 5′-monophosphate RNA, we use the bacterial NCIN-decapping enzyme NudC or the fungal RNA-decapping enzyme Rai1. NudC processes NCIN-capped RNA to 5′-monophosphate RNA by cleaving the diphosphate group of the NCIN cap, yielding products comprising 5′-pNp- (where N is the 3′ nucleoside moiety of the NCIN) followed by the remainder of the RNA (Cahová et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Höfer et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Rai1 processes NCIN-capped RNAs to 5′-monophosphate RNA by cleaving the phosphodiester bond connecting the NCIN cap to the remainder of the RNA, yielding products comprising 5′-p- followed by the remainder of the RNA (Jiao et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). NudC and Rai1 process RNA capped with at least four of the nucleoside-containing metabolites that can serve as NCINs: NAD+, NADH, dpCoA, and FAD (Bird et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Cahová et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Jiao et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Vvedenskaya et al., 2018a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/16-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Enzymatic Processing of RNA 5′ Ends by Rpp, NudC, and Rai1\nSet heat block to 37°C.\nAliquot RNA into 1.7 mL nuclease-free tubes.\nRpp Treatment\nFor selective processing of uncapped, 5′-triphosphate RNA to 5′-monophosphate RNA we use the RNA processing enzyme RNA 5′ polyphosphatase (Rpp), which cleaves the phosphodiester bond between the triphosphate β and α phosphates, yielding products comprising 5′-p- followed by the remainder of the RNA (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Reaction mixtures performed without addition of Rpp serve as a control.\nAssemble the reactions as indicated below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_16_4.csv\nIncubate at 37°C for 30 min.\nNudC Treatment",
    "NudC processes NCIN-capped RNA to 5′-monophosphate RNA by cleaving the diphosphate group of the NCIN cap, yielding products comprising 5′-pNp- (where N is the 3′-nucleoside moiety of the NCIN, for example the adenosine moiety of NAD+) followed by the remainder of the RNA (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Reaction mixtures performed without addition of NudC serve as a control.\nAssemble the reactions as indicated below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_16_5.csv\nIncubate reactions at 37°C for 30 min.\nRai1 Treatment\nRai1 processes NCIN-capped RNAs to 5′-monophosphate RNA by cleaving the phosphodiester bond connecting the NCIN cap to the remainder of the RNA, yielding products comprising 5′-p- followed by the remainder of the RNA (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Reaction mixtures performed without addition of Rai1 serve as a control.\nAssemble the reactions as indicated below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_16_6.csv\nIncubate reactions at 37°C for 30 min.\nNote: As mentioned above, NudC and Rai1 process RNA capped with at least four of the nucleoside-containing metabolites that can serve as NCINs: NAD+, NADH, dpCoA, and FAD. Therefore, use of NudC or Rai1 enables detection of NAD+-, NADH-, dpCoA-, and FAD-capped RNA by CapZyme-seq.\nRecovery of RNA Products after Enzymatic Processing\nTiming: ∼4 h\nRNA Products Generated In Vitro\nAdd 20 μL of 2x RNA loading dye to the sample and load along with a ssRNA ladder on a 10% TBE-urea slab gels. Run gel in 1x TBE buffer until bromophenol blue dye front reaches ∼1/2 of the length of the gel.\nIncubate gel with SYBR Gold nucleic acid gel stain and visualize bands with UV transillumination. Excise RNA products of the expected size from the gel using a scalpel. Gels for distinct reactions should be stained in separate containers.\nElute RNAs from gel using the procedure described in (A, Isolation of RNA products, step 1-7).",
    "Resuspend RNAs in 10 μL of nuclease-free water. Pipette the suspension and incubate on ice for at least 20 min to permit full resuspension of the RNA.\nNote: Considering the relatively low amount of RNA generated by in vitro transcription, we do not recommend acid phenol/chloroform purification after enzymatic treatments as this may result in significant RNA loss. Instead, we recommend gel purification as described above.\nCritical: We do not recommend heating samples prior to gel loading as it may result in degradation of the 5′ end NCIN cap.\nOptional: If desired, GlycoBlue can be used to assist in the visualization of the RNA pellet. However, use of GlycoBlue interferes with quantification of cDNA by Qubit ssDNA and dsDNA Assay kits.\nRNA Products Generated In Vivo\nAdd nuclease-free H2O to 200 μL, mix with 200 μL of acid phenol/chloroform pH 4.5 and purify RNAs using the procedure described in (B, RNA isolation, step 5a-f).\nResuspend RNA in 10 μL of nuclease-free water. Pipette the suspension and incubate on ice for 20 min to permit solubilization of RNA.\n5′ Adaptor Ligation\nTiming: ∼18-20 h\nCapZyme-seqNudC involves quantitative comparisons between RNA samples treated with Rpp or NudC, along with two “mock” treated samples. CapZyme-seqRai1 involves quantitative comparisons between RNA samples treated with Rpp or Rai1, along with two “mock” treated samples. Thus, to enable quantitative comparisons between the four samples in CapZyme-seqNudC or CapZyme-seqRai1, a unique, barcoded 5′-adaptor oligonucleotide is used in ligation reactions performed with each of the four individual samples (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] and table below).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/16-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. CapZyme-Seq Library Construction Workflow",
    "After the ligation reactions have been performed, the four samples of adaptor-ligated products are isolated by gel electrophoresis, combined together, and used for the remaining steps of library construction. After high-throughput sequencing, the identity of the 5′-adaptor barcode is used to associate each sequencing read with the sample from which it was derived.\nThe barcoded 5′-adaptor oligonucleotides also carry an extended randomized region that provides each sequencing read with a unique molecular identifier, “UMI,” enabling quantitative comparisons between cDNA libraries generated from RNA subjected to distinct enzymatic treatments. A typical CapZyme-seq experiment involves analysis of RNA subjected to four distinct treatments, and thus requires use of four barcoded 5′-adapters. Each barcoded 5′-adaptor contains a four nucleotide barcode followed by an 11-nucleotide randomized sequence. The barcode comprises the first four bases of each sequencing read while the 11-nucleotide randomized sequence comprises bases 5 to 15 of each sequencing read. Thus, the identity of the first four bases of each read is used to associate each sequencing read with a corresponding enzymatic processing reaction while bases 5 to 15 of each sequencing read are used as a UMI to reduce effects of PCR amplification bias.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_16_7.csv\nAssemble ligation reaction as indicated below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_16_8.csv\nNote: The concentration of the 5′ adapter in reactions performed using RNA generated in vivo is three times greater than in reactions performed using RNA generated in vitro.\nIncubate reactions at 16°C for 16 h.\nStop each reaction by adding 30 μL of 2x RNA loading dye. Load the four ligation reactions along with a ssRNA ladder on a 10% 7M urea slab gel. Run gel in 1x TBE buffer until the bromophenol blue dye front reaches ∼1/2 of the length of the gel.",
    "Incubate gels with SYBR Gold nucleic acid gel stain and visualize bands with UV transillumination (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Gels for individual ligation mixture should be stained in their own container.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/16-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Pipette the suspension and incubate on ice for at least 20 min to enable full resuspension of the 5′-adaptor-ligated products.\nNote: For analysis of RNA products having a defined range of lengths, excise the portion of the gel slightly above and slightly below the desired size range. For analysis of all RNA products, excise the portion of the gel slighlty above the 5′ adapter to the top.\nFirst-Strand cDNA Synthesis\nTiming: ∼6-7 h\nMix 15 μL of 5′-adaptor-ligated products with 0.3 μL of 100 μM of the reverse transcription (RT) primer (or a mixture of several RT primers to analyze several promoter sequences that are each upstream of a distinct transcribed region).\nIncubate the mixture at 65°C for 5 min, then cool to 4°C.\nPrepare the RT reaction mix as indicated below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_16_9.csv\nAdd mixture prepared in step 1 to mixture prepared in step 2.

Submit libraries for sequencing.\nNote: Use of ePCR minimizes the generation of amplicons derived from “template switching.”\nNote: Optimization of the amplification of cDNAs by ePCR is critical for successful library sequencing. In our experience, use of a Qubit ssDNA Assay kit to prepare ssDNA dilution of ∼109 molecules/μl provides an imprecise measure of ssDNA concentration, likely because of chemicals in the solution that interfere with quantitation.",
    "Note: Barcoded libraries generated by CapZyme-seq are suitable for sequencing on Illumina NextSeq and Illumina HiSeq platforms in high-output mode. Sequencing primers provided by Illumina typically contain a mixture of several oligos. To avoid potential complications that may arise due to the presence of additional primers in the Illumina reagents we use a custom sequencing primer (s1115)."
