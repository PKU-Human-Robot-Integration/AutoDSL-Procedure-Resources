    "NOTE: No ethics consideration since animal and human cancer cells were purchased or kindly provided to us.\n1. Making Collagen Plugs (Pseudo-primary Tumor)\nPrepare a collagen dispersion. Type I collagen from rat tail tendons (RTT) can be either extracted and sterilized as previously reported17, or purchased. Disperse freeze-dried RTT collagen (3.25-3.50 mg/ml in 0.02 N acetic acid) using a blender (high-speed setting; five 2 min runs) for a uniform mixing.\nHarvest (trypsin-EDTA, usually) and use trypan blue exclusion for counting viable cells using a hemocytometer. Adjust to the desired cell density (5 x 104 cells per plug).\nPrepare all solutions (NaOH, fetal bovine serum, DMEM 5x, NaHCO3) separately (Table 1) under sterile conditions and keep chilled on ice. Note: The order of addition of the various solutions is important to prevent osmotic or acidic shocks in cells.\nPerform cell dispersion (1.25 x 106 cells) into the final collagen solution (5 ml) as quickly as possible. Mix well (by pipetting up and down) while avoiding air bubbles, and then quickly distribute 200 µl of the ready-to-use solution in each well of a 96-well plate. Gently strike the multi-well plate on the work area surface of the cell culture hood to remove air bubbles and to spread the solution evenly inside the wells.\nAfter filling up all the wells (this step takes about 15-20 min per 96-well plate), store it into the incubator.\nIncubate the plate at 37 °C from 2 hr to overnight. Collagen gelation (i.e., fibrillogenesis) occurs within 30 min. Add culture medium (100 µl/well) to the culture to perform an overnight incubation.\n2. First Layer of Fibrin Gel\nFibrinogen Solution Preparation.\n\tNOTE: The same batch of fibrin gel should ideally be used for more reproducible results, as fibrin gel formation may vary between different batches of commercial freeze-dried fibrinogen.",
    "Always use a freshly prepared fibrinogen solution. Bring the freeze-dried fibrinogen to room temperature before opening the vial to avoid hydrate crystal formation.\nProgressively dissolve the fibrinogen in pre-warmed (37 °C) Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) with Ca2+/Mg2+ at a working concentration of 3 mg/ml (consider preparing a 15% excess of the minimum final volume required: e.g., 17.25 mg in 5.75 ml for a 5 ml solution).\n\t\t\nAdd pre-warmed HBSS dropwise at first to solubilize fibrinogen fragments. Break down larger fragments with a spatula in the beaker. Agitate the beaker from time to time to facilitate mixing. Do not use a stirrer plate during the procedure. Dissolve the remaining powder by pipetting the suspension up and down.\nKeep the fibrinogen solution lukewarm while sterilizing the solution by passing it through a 0.22 µm filter. Note: If the HBSS is not warm enough or the fibrinogen not fully dissolved, the solution may clog the filter. If applicable, replace filter once or twice, which may decrease the fibrinogen concentration, and thus fibrin clot stiffness.\nSuspend the cells of interest (e.g., endothelial cells) into ready-to-use fibrinogen solution while adjusting its final volume, as an alternative procedure.\nPreparing the Thrombin Solutions.\n\t\nPrepare a stock solution in ddH2O (50 NIH units/ml), then sterilize it using a 0.22 µm filter.\nUse a fibrinogen/thrombin ratio ≥1:0.0075 (v/v) in order to generate the fibrin gel.\nGenerating the Fibrin Gel.\n\t\nKeep the sterile fibrinogen and thrombin stock solutions on ice during all the next steps. The fibrin gels are allowed to form in 24-well plates.\nPromptly overlay the surface of each well with the fibrinogen solution (200 µl/well) while avoiding air bubble formation. Process 6 wells at a time.",
    "Once the fibrinogen solution completely covers the surface of the wells, tilt the plate at a 45° angle and add 1.5 µl of thrombin solution to the first well by dropping the thrombin into the center of the well, and then gently swirl the plate horizontally for 1-2 sec.\n\t\t\nLeave the plate in a stable position under the laminar flow hood (5-10 min) until the gelation/clotting process has completed (N.B.: the polymerization process must not be disturbed, e.g., by transporting the plate to the incubator).\nOnce the first six wells have polymerized, repeat the same sequence (i.e. the 3 previous steps) for the next six wells until all wells have been processed.\n3. Second Layer of Fibrin Gel and Sandwiched Collagen Plug\nOption A: (Using the Collagen Plug Immediately).\n\t\nMake sure that the first layer of fibrin gel has polymerized in all wells by delicately tilting the plate. Place the 96-well plate containing the collagen gel plugs side by side with the 24-well plate (containing the fibrin gels) to ease transfer of the collagen plugs.\nAdd one drop of HBSS into each well of the plate containing the collagen plugs.\nRemove each collagen plug from the well with a thin needle mounted on a syringe (used as a handle) or using a micro-spoon (see video). Transfer each collagen plug onto the first fibrin gel layer using one or two micro-spoons, while making sure that the collagen plug is well centered into the well and that sterility is well maintained.\nOverlay the previously formed fibrin gel with the second layer of fibrinogen solution (300 µl/well) and introduce the thrombin as described in 2.3, keeping a minimal 1:0.0075 ratio and a sequence of six wells at a time.",
    "Option B (Coating the Collagen Plug with a Thin Layer of Growth Factor-reduced Basement Membrane (GFRBM)).\n\t\nCool all the prepared solutions and instruments beforehand and keep them at 4 °C or on ice (e.g., pipettes, tips, test tubes) during handling since frozen aliquots of GFRBM are very sensitive to excessive heating rate during thawing (follow the manufacturer's instructions).\nFollowing removal from the plate wells, soak each collagen plug for 2 min in a 1.5-ml centrifuge tube on ice containing 100 µl of a pure GRFBM solution.\nTransfer each coated plug onto the first fibrin layer while ensuring it is well-centered, as described earlier. Incubate the plug-containing plates at 37 °C for 5 min to allow the GRFBM to form a gel. Add the second fibrin layer as in step 3.1.4.\n4. Cell Culture Medium Conditions\nFill each well with culture medium (400 µl). The culture media and supplements will be selected based on the cell line and experimental conditions.\nAdd aprotinin, an antifibrinolytic agent, to culture medium at a final concentration of 100 kallikrein inhibitor units (KIU)/ml.\n\tNOTE: Store the plates in a cell culture incubator under the conditions used for the cell line tested.\nReplenish cultures with fresh medium every other day or according to the experimental schedule, and add aprotinin. Before adding fresh medium, slightly tilt the plate (at a 30-35° angle) and incline the pipet against the side of the well while carefully suctioning the conditioned medium under constant observation.\nSubscription Required.
