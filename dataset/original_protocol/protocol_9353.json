    "1. Creating the exposure chamber\nCut a vial plug in half using a razor blade. Alternatively, use cotton balls.\nPush the vial plug half, or the cotton ball, to the bottom of a food vial to make a smooth surface that flies will not get stuck in.\nIf making multiple exposure chambers, make sure that the vial plug and food take up the same volume in each chamber. A mark on the side of the vial can facilitate this.\n2. Exposing the flies\nCollect 8 flies of one sex, age 1-5 days, the day before exposure into regular food vials without yeast.\nLabel them in code, such that the experimenter is blinded to the actual genotype/strain used.\nTransfer the eight flies into the exposure chambers by tapping. Do not anesthetize.\nAdd a small amount of food dye, e.g. acid blue 9, to 200 proof ethanol to make it easily visible.\nCoat the bottom of a vial plug, or cotton ball, with 0.5 ml ethanol.\nInsert the ethanol plug into the exposure vial. Ensure that the alcohol is facing into the vial, and not towards the wall of the vial.\nStart a timer counting up.\n3. Record ethanol-induced intoxication\nEach minute after the timer is started, tap the exposure chamber on the bench to startle the flies and observe them for ten seconds.\nRecord the number of stationary flies for each minute. Flies are stationary if they cannot get off their backs, remain in one location, or rapidly vibrate their wings throughout the entire ten-second observation-period. The latter flies are considered stationary because the vast majority of these flies are stationary between periods of rapid wing movement.  Flies are NOT stationary if they can get off their backs and walk away and/or up the vial wall.",
    "An exposure trial is finished when 4 or more flies are recorded as stationary.\nDiscard flies and let the exposure chamber air out for later reuse.\n4. Determine the time to 50% sedation\nThe time to 50% sedation (ST50) is the time after the start of the ethanol exposure when four of the eight flies remain stationary. This is determined as follows:\nEither: the first measurement minute when exactly four flies are stationary.\nOr: if less than four flies (Y1) are stationary at one time point (minute X), and more than four (Y2) at the next measuring time point (minute X+1), then linearly interpolate the ST50 using the formula:\nST50 = (4 - Y1)/(Y2 - Y1) + X\n5. Repeat exposure to determine tolerance\nExposing the flies\nDetermine the ST50(wt) for the wild-type control strain used in your experiment.\nExpose the experimental groups of flies to ethanol as described above.\nMeasure their ST50(1), but continue to expose until you reach the time 2x ST50(wt).\nTransfer the flies back into an empty food vial, and hold for 4 hours.\nRe-expose the flies, and determine the ST50(2) of exposure 2.\nDetermine tolerance\nCalculate tolerance in % as  (ST50(2)/ ST50(1) - 1)x100.\n6. Representative Results:\nShown here, are some representative results we obtained with 6-8 vials of flies per genotype and dose. If your standard error is substantially larger, then a systematic problem likely occurred. Make sure that the ethanol faces into the exposure chambers, and that the chambers are the same volume.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2541/2541fig1.jpg",
    "Figure 1. Dose response curve of wild type flies exposed to increasing percentages of ethanol. Eight vials of flies were exposed per dose and sex. Male and female flies show the same ST50 at each dose (p>0.22, 2-way ANOVA), while the ST50 across doses decreases significantly with increasing ethanol dose (p<0.001). Note that flies from over-crowded bottles can be substantially smaller than those from healthy bottles, and this size difference can affect the ST50. Seed each bottle with 15-20 females laying for 1-2 days to get optimal larval density per bottle.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2541/2541fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Exposing flies to either 90%, or 100% ethanol reproduces the previously described ethanol-resistance caused by the white rabbit1 mutation2 (p<0.001, 2-way ANOVA).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2541/2541fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Repeat exposure to 100% ethanol, spaced by a 4 hour recovery interval, causes a significant increase in ST50 after the second exposure (p<0.001, paired t-test). Note that the flies were exposed for 24 minutes during the first exposure (corresponding to twice their na ve ST50). Exposure for a shorter amount of time (12 minutes) did not cause a significant increase in ST50 upon re-exposure (data not shown)."
