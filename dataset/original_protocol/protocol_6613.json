    "This procedure provides step-by-step instructions for HaloTag-fused protein expression, molecular barcoding of HaloTag-fused proteins, and detection of protein-protein interactions with the barcode (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200916/20200916111349_1031.pngFigure 1. Flowchart of HaloTag-barcoding assay procedures. Designations on the left indicate the amount of time expected to complete each step. Prepare HaloTag expression clones (Steps 1-13) and Ligand-DNA complex (Steps 21-22) in advance before use. Because reagents include only DNA and chemical compounds, they require no special storage condition (-20 °C). Prepare the HaloTag fused proteins immediately prior to use. We have not tested the shelf-life of HaloTag fused proteins (Steps 14-20) and purified barcode proteins (Steps 26-40). We recommend that the barcoded proteins be used within a few months.Preparation of DNA clones with HaloTag fusionORFs cloned into pENTR are available from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC, here[href=https://www.arabidopsis.org/servlets/TairObject?type=stock&id=3501867839]) for $13 USD per pENTR clone (Yazaki et al., 2018). The pENTR clones are then recombined with the custom-designed HaloTag expression vector pIX-His-Halo:ccdB that was derived from pIX-Halo:ccdB (Yazaki et al., 2016; available here[href=https://www.arabidopsis.org/servlets/TairObject?type=vector&id=1001200298]). Note that pENTR clones, in the link listed above, are named pENTR-sﬁ and pENTR-topo and contain spectinomycin and kanamycin resistance genes, respectively. Recombination of the clones with the HaloTag fusion vectors is performed to construct the barcoded proteins in this procedure; however, the procedure can be applied to HaloTag-ORF fusion clones from other organisms such as humans and mice.Reagents for a single reaction (modified from a standard Gateway cloning reaction)1 μl 5x Buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)1 μl pIX vector DNA (100 ng/μl)1.5 μl TE buffer0.5 μl LR clonase enzyme (Invitrogen)Sub total volume: 4 μl per single LR recombination reactionPipet 4 μl from Step 2 into low profile tubes (0.2 ml).",
    "Add 1 μl pENTR clone DNA (50 ng/μl) to each tubeFinal total volume: 5 μl per single LR recombination reactionSeal and vortex briefly to mix the contents. Then centrifuge briefly to collect the sample.Incubate the sealed tube overnight at RT.TransformationThaw DH5α-T1-R competent cells on ice and aliquot 10 μl of cells per tube (low profile tubes) using pipette.Add 1 μl of the LR recombination reaction to aliquoted competent cells (do not pipet up and down). Mix by tapping the tube several times on the bench. Incubate on ice for 30 min.Heat shock cells at 42 °C for 45 s in a heat block. Place cells on ice for ~2 min.Add 100 μl SOC to each tube. SOC should be prewarmed to 37 °C prior to addition. Incubate at 37 °C for 1 h with or without shaking.Inoculate 50 μl of transformation mix from Step 10 into 3 ml of Plusgrow II with ampicillin in a 5 ml conical inoculate tube and culture overnight at 37 °C with shaking. Prepare frozen glycerol stocks of the transformants. Pipette 300 μl of 50% glycerol to each of empty tube. Add 700 μl of overnight culture from Step 11 and mix well by pipetting up and down. Glycerol stocks should be stored at -80 °C.Proceed to plasmid DNA extraction from the remaining culture using the Qiagen Miniprep Kit, following the manufacturer's recommendations.Preparation for HaloTag fused DNA and proteinsCentrifuge the 5-ml conical inoculate tube at 1,500 × g at RT (25 °C) for 10 min to pellet the bacterial cells.Decant the supernatant under a draft chamber and open the caps and dry the tube on a bench.Purify plasmid DNA from the bacterial cell pellet using the Qiagen Miniprep Kit, following the manufacturer's recommendations.Measure the DNA concentration using the Nanodrop.",
    "The expected concentration should be approximately 700 ng/μl.Proceed with protein expression using IVX mix. IVX is an in vitro protein expression system that expresses proteins from a DNA template using a coupled transcription and translation reaction without eukaryote or prokaryote cells. The HaloTag-fused query proteins are individually expressed using the TNT system (see Recipe 5 of IVX mix). The IVX mix should be prepared immediately before use.Incubate the tube with IVX mix at 30 °C for 2 h.Freeze and store at -80 °CPreparation of ligand-DNA complex and barcoded HaloTag-fused proteinsPrepare 500 μM barcode DNA oligonucleotide with 5′ modification by dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) in RNase-free water (Table 1 and Recipe 14). Prepare 500 μM azido-HaloTag ligand, AzHLT-1 (Recipe 4).Table 1. Cycloalkyne-modified 100-bp DNA oligonucleotides. This table has been adapted from Yazaki et al. (2020). The Barcode DNA are synthesized by Eurofin as single stranded DNA with the 5′-modified by dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) and the 3′-modified tetramethylrhodamine (TMR).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200916/20200916111415_4332.pngMix 2 μl of 500 μM DNA (Table 1) and 0.5 μl of 500 μM azido-HaloTag ligand AzHLT-1 (4:1) and incubate at RT for 1 h (click reaction). The final concentrations of the mixture ingredients are 400 μM DNA and 100 μM HaloTag ligand.Combine 100 μl of HaloTag fused proteins obtained in Step 20 with 1 μl of DNA-ligand mixture from Step 22 at RT. Separately, combine 1 μg of HaloTag protein G with 1 μl of DNA-ligand mix for conjugation control.Incubate at RT for 1 h.Confirm DNA-protein conjugation by SDS-PAGE using 5-12.5% gradient gels (Figure 2). The size of the conjugated products should be higher than that of non-barcoded proteins. DNA conjugated proteins (10 μl; ~10% of total amount of reaction 101 μl) were loaded. Non-barcoded proteins (2.5 μl: 2.",
    "5% of input) were loaded as a negative control (lanes B1-B5, B6-B10) to indicate the original protein size. The results of HaloTag protein staining using TMR-modified DNA barcode are shown in Figure 2 (lanes A1-A5, A6-A10). The size of the protein-DNA conjugation shows a higher molecular weight in Figure 2 (lanes A1-A5, A6-A10) compared to HaloTag proteins with no conjugated DNA barcode according to TMR ligand staining in Figure 2 (lanes B1-B5, B6-B10). Stained proteins were visualized based on the fluorescence of TMR at 532 nm using a Fluorescent Image Analyzer (FujiFilm,  FLA3000  ).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200916/20200916111437_6669.pngFigure 2.

Right panel (proteins 6-10) was modified from Supplemental Figure S3 of Yazaki et al., 2020.Purify DNA-HaloTag fusion proteins (barcoded proteins) from Step 24 using a histidine tag purification kit (Pure Speed PS/E4 Multi Starter Kit and 1000/20 μl IMAC tips) at RT (Figure 3). Set the ColorTrack Guide under the platform with the deep-well plate aligned above (Figure 3A).",
    "Place the deep-well plate on the platform and slide it into position along the rails of the platform of the Pure Speed PS/E4 Multi Starter Kit (Figure 3B).For 10 barcoded protein purifications, use the E12-1200XLS multichannel pipette to add 500 μL buffer A2 (Recipe 7) to wells A2-A11 in a 96-deepwell plate for column equilibration (Equilibration rows in Figure 3A, 3B). Add 1,100 μl buffer A2 to wells B2-B11 to capture the sample (Capture rows in Figure 3A, 3B). Add 500 μl buffer A2 to wells C2-C11 to wash the sample (1st wash rows in Figure 3A, 3B). Add 500 μl buffer A2 to wells D2-D11 to wash the sample (2nd wash rows in Figure 3A, 3B). Add ~100 μl buffer B2 to wells E2-E11 to elute the purified sample (Elution rows in Figure 3A, 3B). After preparing the plate, add all barcoded protein sample (101 μl or rest of all samples) from Step 24 to wells B2-B11 immediately before starting purification (Capture rows in Figure 3A, 3B).Load the PureSpeed resin tips (PS Tips 1000/20 μl IMAC) to channel numbers 2-11 on the E12-1200XLS multichannel pipette (Figure 3C).Load the two adapter tips (blue adapter for PS Tips 1000/20 μl IMAC) to channels number 1 and 12, which is next to the outer resin tip on the E12-1200XLS multichannel pipette to secure the pipette assembly (Figure 3C).Place the E12-1200XLS multichannel pipette with 12 loaded tips in wells A1-12 (equilibration rows) of the 96-deep-well plate for column equilibration (Figure 3D).Choose the default program for IMAC 1000/20 μl on the E12-1200XLS multichannel pipette. The program for histidine tag purification contains resin equilibration (Figure 3D), capture (Figure 3E), wash (Figures 3F, 3G), and elution of the sequence (Figure 3H).",
    "Press the CONT key on the E12-1200XLS multichannel pipette to start the purification process and follow the instructions given on the screen of the multichannel pipette. This step allows for the elimination of excess amounts of barcode DNA, ligand, and barcode-ligand complex which are not conjugated to the proteins.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200916/20200916111523_6511.pngFigure 3.

Insert the Amicon Ultra-2 10k column device into the filtrate collection tube.Pipet all purified barcoded proteins into the Amicon-ultra 10k column and add 1x PBS up to 2 ml in the column. Cover the column with the collection tube.Place the filtrate collection tube, covered with the 10k column, into the centrifuge rotor. Orient the membrane panel in the column to the center of the rotor (one panel facing up and the other panel facing down). Confirm that the device composed of the filtrate collection, filter column, and collection tube are seated on the bottom of the rotor. Ensure that the rim of the collection tube is completely inside the rotor walls.",
    "Ensure that the rotor is balanced with a second column device placed directly opposite of the first column.Centrifuge at 4,000 × g at 4 °C for 20-30 min.Remove the filtrate collection tube. Invert the filter column and collection tube.Place the collection tube with filter column in the centrifuge. Ensure that the rotor is balanced by a second column device placed directly opposite of the first column.Centrifuge at 1,000 × g at 4 °C for 2 min to transfer the concentrated and dialyzed proteins from the filter column to the collection tube. The final concentrate volume is to be 30-60 μl. The protein levels produced by TNT and conjugation ratios are constant for most ORFs (Yazaki et al., 2016 and 2020 and Figure 2). Therefore, it is not necessary to check all purified conjugations using SDS-PAGE.Freeze and store the sample at -80 °C (not necessary to Snap-freeze).Detection of protein-protein interaction with barcoded proteinsPipette 5 μl HaloTag Magna beads into a 200-μl PCR tube. Wash the beads three times with 1x PBST on the Magna Stand. Add 10 μl of PBST to the washed beads.Add 9 μl of bait protein from Step 20 to tubes containing 10 μl of beads in a total volume of 19 μl.

Hold the sample at 4 °C. Calculate the sample concentration based on the standard curve with 200 pM, 20 pM, 2 pM, and 0.2 pM of Oligo01 (Table 1) without TMR modification.Vortex the sample from Step 46. Prepare 12,000 molecules per 2 μl of sample with beads based on the qPCR results in Step 47 using the dilution buffer (Recipe 11). i.e., to obtain 12,000 molecules, follow the dilution condition below;Prepare 1 pM of barcoded proteins based on the results of Step 47.Next, dilute 1 pM sample from Procedure A by 100-fold to prepare 0.01 pM of the proteins.Pipette 2 μl of 0.01 pM of the proteins as 12,000 molecules.Prepare the PCR master mix for all sample reactions.

The size of the amplified products should be 174 base pairs.Note: PCR primers with the forward and reverse index can be used for PCR amplification with Mighty Amp. Non-specific amplification may occur based on the combination of primers and amounts of template DNA used (Figure 4B black arrows).",
    "To avoid nonspecific amplification, we recommend changing the primer combination and template DNA, as non-specific amplification products may be obtained rather than the 174-bp product. Non-specific amplification in Figure 4B was observed with a primer combination of Foward6-Reverse3 in Table 2. To avoid this, pairs of primer Foward8-Reverse1 in Table 2 showed specific amplification (Figure 4A black arrows).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200916/20200916111720_1817.pngFigure 4. Barcode DNA amplification results from library preparation steps. A. PCR amplification yields consistent results as 174-bp products (arrow). B. Anticipated results from nonspecific PCR amplification. Improper pairs of forward and reverse combination of primers lead to unexpected results in amplification (arrows). We recommend changing the pairs of indexed primer and template DNA when unexpected amplification results are observed. Please see the notes section for our recommended changes to the primer pairs to avoid unexpected amplification products.

The Flow Cell Chart (left) shows a color matrix of the data quality at each swath (section of flow cell). The flow cell for MiSeq is a single lane flow cell. The Data by Cycle (top middle) shows plots of signal intensities, Q30 score, and base percentages, which can indicate the quality of the sequence data by each cycle. The Data By Lane (bottom middle) shows the density of clusters passing the filter as a percentage of raw cluster density. QScore Distribution (top right) shows the percentage of reads with a QScore.",
    "A QScore ≥ 30, the percentage of bases with a quality score of 30 or higher, is positively correlated to the base call quality. A higher QScore indicates a smaller probability of error. A quality score of 30 represents an error rate of 1 in 1,000, with a corresponding call accuracy of 99.9%. A detailed explanation for QScore can be found here[href=https://jp.illumina.com/science/technology/next-generation-sequencing/plan-experiments/quality-scores.html]."
