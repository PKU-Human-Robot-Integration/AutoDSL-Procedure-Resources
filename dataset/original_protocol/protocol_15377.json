    "All equipments and reagents used are sterile. The protocol was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) at the NEI/NIH (animal study protocol NEI-553), and was performed according to the NIH guidelines and regulations.\n1. Producing the angiogenic factor-containing pellets\nIn this part, the pellets containing the angiogenic factor of interest are prepared.\nMake 10% (w/v) sucralfate solution with PBS. Store under room temperature.\nMake 12% (w/v) poly-HEMA with absolute ethanol. Store under room temperature.\nMake 1 μg/μl bFGF solution. Store in -80 °C.\nTo make 50 pellets, mix 5 μl of poly-HEMA, 1μl of sucralfate and 4 μl of bFGF stock solution, vortex thoroughly.\nPlace a piece of clean parafilm in a Petri dish, expose it under UV light for 15 min in a tissue culture hood. Drop 0.2 μl of the solution mixture on the parafilm for one pellet. Thus, 10 μl of the solution mixture should yield 50 pellets. Let the pellets dry at room temperature for 1-2 hours. The dried pellets can be stored in 4 oC for several days, or -80 °C for several months.\nUpon usage, pry and pick up the pellets with the tips of a pair of forceps. Be extremely careful not to break them or make them spring away.\n2. Performing the mouse cornea pocket assay\nIn this part, we will demonstrate how to make a pocket in the mouse cornea, and how to insert a pellet into the pocket. The angiogenic factor contained in the pellet will be released gradually to the surrounding areas of the cornea (Fig. 1). In this demonstration, we use 8-week female C57/Bl6 mice.",
    "The mouse is deeply systematically anesthetized with the mixture of ketamine (75 mg/kg) and xylazine (5mg/kg, i.p. injection). This will keep the mouse under an anesthesia state for 30-60 min. Topical anesthetic (0.5% proparacaine HCl) is applied to the cornea. After 5 min, fix one eye under a dissecting microscope.\nA very gentle cut is made in the middle of the cornea 1.2 -1.4 mm from the corneal limbus (as illustrated in Figure 1) with a von Graefe cataract knife. Be extremely careful not to cut through the cornea.\nA pocket is made under the epithelium layer of the cornea by horizontally inserting the knife into the middle of the cornea and extending the knife toward the limbus carefully (Fig.1). The size of the pocket has to be big enough to accommodate one angiogenic factor-containing pellet. Be extremely careful not to puncture through the cornea.\nInsert a pellet with a pair of forceps into the pocket slowly. Try to make the pellet as flat as possible.\nAfter implantation of the pellet, a topical ophthalmic antibiotic ointment is applied to the eye. Instruments are wiped with 70% alcohol pads between animals.\nMove the mouse to a warm and dry area and monitor it, until it is able to maintain an upright posture and then return it to its home cage. Systemic analgesics (e.g., buprenorphine, 2 mg/kg, i.p. injection) and topical antibiotic ointment (e.g. gentamicin) are given twice daily for 2 days after the surgery and the mouse is closely monitored for 3 days. Healing is expected to complete within the first 48 hours post-surgery. The eye with the pocket will be examined under a slit-lamp biomicro scope between days 4-10 after pellet implantation.\n3. Representative results",
    "Seven days after the pellet implantation, the mouse is anesthetized systemically and topically as described in 2.1.\nObserve the blood vessels in the cornea induced by the angiogenic factor under a dissecting microscope. In the cornea treated with vehicle, no blood vessel growth can be observed (Fig. 2A, vehicle-treated cornea). In the cornea treated with bFGF, robust angiogenesis can be seen (Fig. 2B). The blood vessel growth can be assessed using the maximum length of the blood vessels (from the normal limbal vessels to the top of the new vessels), and the total blood vessel areas (Fig. 2B, delineated with a red dashed line in the bFGF-treated cornea). Other quantification methods have also been described 2,5.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3077/3077fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. A. Normal cornea with H&E staining. No blood vessel exists in a normal cornea. B. Make a pocket underneath the epithelium layer of the cornea. C. Embed a pellet into the pocket. D. The angiogenic factor is released from the pellet, and new blood vessels grow from the normal limbal vessels.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3077/3077fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Representative result five days after implantation of the pellet. A. Cornea with a pellet \ncontaining the vehicle only. No new blood vessel formation in the cornea. Only the pre-existing normal limbal vessels are visible. B. Cornea with a pellet containing bFGF. Robust new blood vessels (dot-lined) grew from the pre-existing normal limbal vessels.Subscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
