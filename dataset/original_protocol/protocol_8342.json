    "All surgical procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Sungkyunkwan University.\n1. Sample Preparation\nNote: Autoclave all surgical instruments before animal handling. Conduct all surgical performance in a room dedicated to surgical procedures. Sterile surgical gowns and gloves should be worn by all personnel in the surgical room at all times.\nTissue Fixation\nPrepare two 10 mL syringes each filled with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS.\nAnesthetize a 7-12-week-old mouse, (C57BL/6J or any mouse lines with either gender) by administering a mixture of zoletil and xylazine (1:1, 20 mg/kg each) or an alternative suitable anesthesia regime (e.g., mixture of 80 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine) with an intraperitoneal injection.\nOnce the mouse has reached a surgical plane of anesthesia (use the toe pinch-response method), expose the heart by cutting off the skin and the rib cage with scissors.\nSnip the right atrium with small scissors to drain the blood and perfuse the PBS and PFA solution sequentially through the left ventricle with a needle (perfusion rate = 4 mL/min, volume = 10 mL for each solution).\n\t\tNote: The mouse becomes stiff if the procedure is successfully completed. The use of eye ointment or sterilization is not necessary as the procedure is terminal. The fixation procedure may be skipped. However, this step is recommended to minimize structural deformations including mechanical tissue damage and ischemic axonal swelling. For further details on tissue fixation, refer to the article by Gage, G. J. et al.10\nPreparation of the Brain Slice \nDecapitate the mouse with surgical scissors through the ventral thorax and abdomen.\nRemove the scalp and periosteum using a suitably small scissors until fully exposing the cranium.",
    "Break the frontal bone and cut the cranium along the sagittal suture from the occipital bone using small scissors with care not to damage the brain.\nGently remove the cranium and the dura mater sequentially using fine forceps.\nExtract the brain using a soft plastic spoon, taking care not to damage the tissue.\nRinse and soak the extracted brain in a 4% PFA solution for 30 min at 4 °C.\nSlice the fixed brain into 100 – 150 µm sections using a vibratome.\n\t\tNote: For further details on the tissue preparation, refer to the article by Segev et al.11. For subsequent procedures, the tissue should be sliced into sections thinner than the thickness of the spacer.\nMounting of the Brain Slice\nPrepare 1 glass slide and 2 square cover glasses (22 × 22 × 0.17 mm) for each tissue slice.\nCut one of the square cover glasses into half (two rectangular pieces) by using a glass cutter.\nAttach the two of the halved cover glasses using a super glue on the slide glass.\n\t\tNote: The space between the two halved glasses should be slightly larger than the size of the tissue slice.\nHarvest the brain slice using a brush or a pipette and lay the tissue on the slide glass between the spacer. Take care not to fold the tissue.\nDispense 100 μL of PBS on the tissue surface.\nPlace the other square cover glass on top of the tissue. Avoid inclusion of air bubbles during this stage.\nSeal around the cover glass using a nail polish (or alternatively suitable adhesives) to prevent evaporation of PBS and contamination by dust during the subsequent imaging session.\n\t\tNote: The experimenter may pause at this stage.\n2. Calibration",
    "Switch on the microscope at least 1 h before the imaging to allow thermal stabilization of the laser source (see Table of Materials). Then, turn on the software for spectral scanning (see Table of Materials) and click the Acquire button on the top of GUI (Figure 3a).\nTurn on the software shutter for the white-light laser (WLL) and photomultiplier tube (PMT) (Figure 3a).\nSelect the xyΛ mode on the drop-down list in Acquisition Mode, then, the laser input mode is automatically changed from Constant percent to Constant Power. Uncheck the check-box of Automatic SP Movement. And then, set the spectral window of the input laser to 470–670 nm and the spectral step size to 4 nm on Λ-Excitation Lambda Scan Settings (Figure 3b).\nSET the spectral range of PMT to 450-690 by double-clicking or moving the adjustment bar for spectral range (Figure 3c).\n\tNote: This spectral range should include the complete bandwidth of the input source.\nSelect a water-immersion objective lens, suitably with a high numerical aperture (NA > 0.7) and give any value to PMT and laser power to activate AOBS configuration and Live Scan button. Switch the optical path by checking reflection in the AOBS Configuration (Figure 3d).\nMount a reference mirror (see Table of Materials) on the microscope stage. The mirror surface should be faced against the objective lens. If it is not easy to put the mirror on the microscope stage, bond a mirror onto the flat plate (e.g. slide glass).\nControl the microscope stage to align the focal plane to the mirror surface.\nAdjust the PMT gain and the laser power considering the dynamic range of the detector and then change the laser input mode from Constant Percent to Constant Power.",
    "Note: As is typical, a PMT gain of 500 (V) and a relative laser power of 0.1% are used at 570 nm.\nConfirm in a pseudo-color mode to check that there is no saturation throughout the wavelength range. If saturation is observed, lower the laser power (Figure 3a).\nRun the Lambda Scan acquisition.\nRemove the mirror from the stage and repeat the same acquisition without a sample in order to obtain the dark reference (i.e., dark offset).\nSave the data in a Multistacked TIF format.\n3. SpeRe Image Acquisition\nPlace the mounted tissue on the microscope stage. To roughly align the tissue to the focal plane of the objective lens, use the wide-field fluorescence mode through an eye-piece.\nWith the Live Scan on, control the microscope stage to align the focal plane to the region of interest in the tissue. To avoid the background noise from the cover slip, select the target region of at least 15 μm depth from the glass-tissue interface.\nAcquire the spectral image stack for the target region using the same procedure as described in steps 2.1–2.10.\nSave the data for the tissue and the dark offset in Multistacked TIF format.\n\tNote: The experimenter may pause at this stage.\n4. Image Processing and Analysis\nOpen the spectral data (multistacked TIF) for the reference mirror and the brain tissue in ImageJ.\nSelect the ROIs (regions of interest) for the opened image stacks—the central area for the reference mirror and the segment of an axon fiber for the brain tissue.\nAcquire the raw spectra for the selected ROIs by running Image → Stacks → Plot Z-axis profile on the ImageJ menu.\nOpen the dark offset data, one taken for the reference mirror and the other taken for the brain tissue.",
    "Acquire the spectra for the dark offsets by running Image → Stacks → Plot Z-axis profile on the ImageJ menu.\nSave all the acquired spectra by using the Copy and Paste options.\n\tNote: For SpeRe imaging, use of the central imaging field to minimize off-axis optical aberrations is recommended. The axon fibers may be structurally heterogeneous along their length. Hence, selecting the ROI on a small axon segment, typically < 5 µm, to minimize partial-volume artifact is recommended.\n5. Baseline Correction and SpeRe Signal Analysis\nSubtract the offset spectra from the spectra of the reference mirror and the brain tissues.\nNormalize each spectrum by dividing the maximum intensity of the spectrum.\nDivide the normalized spectrum of the axon by the normalized spectrum of the reference mirror and subtract DC offset from the normalized spectrum.\nMeasure the wavenumber frequency by fitting the acquired spectrum to a sinusoidal curve (see Table of Materials), and then convert the acquired wavenumber to periodicity by taking reciprocal.\nConvert the wavenumber periodicity to the axon diameter using the equation in Figure 4c.\nSubscription Required.
