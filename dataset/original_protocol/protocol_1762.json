Regional indications for skeletal muscle collection from the turquoise killifish\nA representative image of male fish at 5 weeks after hatching with a 1 cm scale bar. The yellow line indicates shallow cutting sites for skin removal. The area surrounded by the black line is the region of muscle collection.\nCollect the skeletal muscle area, indicated as a black line in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], while avoiding contamination with other tissues.\nFreeze in liquid nitrogen and store tissue at −80°C before use.\nGrind the frozen muscle finely (particle size < 100 μm) with a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen. [Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]]\nNote: Due to the hardness of frozen muscle, we have also tried to grind tissue with a bead beater using different sizes of tungsten beads ranging in diameter from 3 mm to 1 cm. However, the desired fineness was not achieved.\nCritical: It is hard to measure particle size while grinding, but particle fineness to be optimal when the muscle powder sticks to the mortar wall tightly even in the presence of liquid nitrogen, or you might grind 600 mg of skeletal muscle for 15 min.\nAdd 200 mg aliquots of tissue powder to e-tubes.\nStore the tubes at −80°C.\nRibosome purification\nTiming: 2 days—Ribosome purification should be performed on ice.\nHomogenize 600 mg of finely ground skeletal muscle in 30 mL of homogenization buffer. [Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]]\nNote: To purify enough ribosomes for a single Cryo-electron microscopy (EM) experiment, we generally use 600 mg of tissue.",
    "Filter homogenized tissue through two layers of miracloth (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1351-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Procedure of ribosome enrichment\n(A) Filtering of homogenized skeletal muscle.\n(B) Removal of cell/tissue debris. Homogenized skeletal muscle transferred to a polypropylene centrifuge tube.\n(C) Preparation of sucrose cushion. Sucrose cushion buffer is filled from the bottom of an ultra-clear centrifuge tube avoiding bubble formation by using a long-tip Pasteur pipette.\n(D) Loading of protein extract onto the sucrose cushion. The yellow arrow indicates the intact sucrose/protein extract layer.\n(E) Discarding of the supernatant after centrifugation.\n(F) Ribosome pellet (yellow-dashed circle) on the bottom of the tube.\n(G) Collection of ribosome pellet after three washes.\n(H) Transfer of the ribosome pellet to a new tube.\nNote: Collect homogenized solution by squeezing miracloth, thereby minimizing sample loss.\nCentrifuge at 14,000×g for 5 min at 4°C to remove debris.\nTransfer supernatant into polypropylene centrifuge tubes.\nCentrifuge at 30,000×g for 20 min at 4°C (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nRepeat steps 11 and 12.\nCollect clear supernatant in a 50 mL tube.\nPrepare sucrose cushion tubes by adding 4 mL of sucrose cushion buffer to ultra-clear centrifuge tubes (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nNote: Because the ultra-clear centrifuge tubes have a narrow neck, it is much easier to use a Pasteur pipet as a funnel for filling sucrose from the bottom.\nLoad cleared solution from step 14 onto sucrose cushion. Make sure not to disrupt the sucrose cushion layer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nHeat-seal the top of the tube after balancing with a seal former and cordless tube topper.\nCentrifuge at 150,000×g for 12 h at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant very carefully so as not to lose the ribosome pellet (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nVery carefully wash the pellets three times with 1 mL of washing buffer.",
    "Note: Make the washing buffer flow the surface of the pellet couple of times per wash. Try not to touch pellet while washing.\nCritical: It is easy to lose a ribosome pellet in this step, so make sure that the ribosome pellet stays on the tube wall every wash. [Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]]\nCheck to see if a transparent ribosome pellet is visible at the bottom of the tube (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nCollect ribosome pellets with a tip and resuspend them in 50 μL of resuspension buffer (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G and 2H).\nNote: The pipette tip should be cut diagonally for easier collection of the ribosome pellet. The ribosome pellet is sticky, making it difficult to collect from the tube. Transferring a ribosome pellet can be facilitated by touching the e-tube wall. The remaining ribosome pellets should be collected by adding resuspension buffer directly to the centrifuge tube.\nGently dissolve ribosome pellets by pipetting, while avoiding bubble formation. [Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]]\nCentrifuge at 20,000×g for 10 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the clear supernatant to a new tube.\nRibosome purity check\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThis step determines the quality and quantity of the isolated ribosomes prior to making a cryo-EM grid.\nMeasure optical density (OD) at 260 nm (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1351-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Enriched ribosomes\n(A) Determination of ribosome quantity and purity by measuring RNA concentration. A260 should be over 8 and wave-length dependent absorbance should be checked shown as in the Figure.\n(B) Contamination check by TEM.\n(C) Reference image of ribosomes by Cryo-EM.\nNote: OD 8–12 at 260 nm is a good quantity range. If OD is higher than 12, adjust ribosome into OD 8–12 with resuspension buffer.\nAssess ribosome purity by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (tecnai G2 F20, ThermoFisher) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nGlow discharge a grid (Quantifoil R2/2) with argon gas for 30 sec.",
    "Note: We used the Gatan Plasma System (US100, Gatan) using the instructions on the screen of the equipment.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1351_2.csv\nLoad 4 μL of isolated ribosome onto the grid and incubate for 30 sec.\nWash the grid twice by placing the grid briefly onto a drop of distilled water.\nRemove excess water from the grid by touching the grid edge with filter paper.\nIncubate the grid in uranyl acetate for 30 sec.\nWash the grid twice by placing the grid briefly onto a drop of distilled water.\nRemove excess water from the grid by touching the grid edge with filter paper.\nDry the grid for 5 min at 25°C.\nNote: Ribosomes usually stained darker than background in our trials. It is critical to check ribosome particle distribution, aggregation and contamination.\nPreparation of cryo-EM grid\nTiming: 2–4 h\nThis step describes preparing grids for cryo-EM. This step can be adjusted according to sample condition.\nGlow discharge both sides of a new grid with argon gas for 30 s which is the same condition above (step 27a).\nCoat the grid with graphene oxide. [Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]]\nLoad 3 μL of graphene oxide solution onto the carbon side and incubate for 2 min\nRemove excess graphene oxide from the grid by touching the grid edge with filter paper and wash three times by placing the grid on distilled water drop.\nRemove excess water on the grid touching grid edge to filter paper.\nDry for 5 min and use within a month without additional glow-discharge.\nNote: This step is performed according to a described protocol (Bokori-Brown et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nCryo-EM grid preparation\nSet-up Vitrobot for Cryo-EM grid preparation.\nNote: We used VitrobotTM (FEI, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the process parameters on the screen of the equipment.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1351_3.csv",
    "Load 3 μL of sample onto the graphene oxide coated grid.\nWait 30 s and blot the ribosomes for 3 s with 10 of blotting force.\nNote: When you are trying to optimize sample blotting conditions for a new sample, it is recommended that 6–12 grids be prepared per sample and that different sample concentrations and waiting and blotting times to be tested.\nStore grids in liquid nitrogen before imaging and data collection.\nCollect data (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C)."
