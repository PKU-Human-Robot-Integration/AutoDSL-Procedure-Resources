    "Procedures involving animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System. Surgical instruments and solutions were sterilized prior to surgery to limit postoperative infections and complications.\n1. Surgical technique\nConduct experiments using aseptic techniques and according to institution specific animal use protocols.\nSterilize instruments and materials that contact living tissues to prevent infections, avoid negatively impacting animal welfare, and minimize potential negative influences on the study. Clean surgical instruments thoroughly with water and detergent or enzymatic products to remove foreign materials and sterilize by steam or flash sterilization.\nAliquot liquids into sterile containers in a tissue culture hood. Sterilize the microliter syringe by flushing it with 70% ethanol and rinsing it with sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\n2. Anesthesia\nAnesthetize rats using an isoflurane vaporizer system. Vaporize isoflurane at a concentration of 4.5% using medical grade oxygen at a rate of 1 L/min into an attached anesthesia box. Place the animal into the anesthesia box until breathing slows and the animal is sedated.\n\tNOTE: This initial step using anesthesia with a gas anesthetic is not necessary if the operator is comfortable and familiar with administering injectables anesthetics to non-sedated animals.\nWithdraw a sufficient volume of an anesthetic cocktail composed of ketamine (50 mg/kg), xylazine (2.6 mg/kg), and acepromazine (0.5 mg/kg) into a 30 G tuberculin syringe. Remove the sedated animal from the anesthesia box. Administer the injection of anesthesia intraperitoneally to attain consistent depth of sedation throughout the procedure and return the animal to its cage.\nBegin the procedure when a toe pinch fails to evoke a response. Evaluate the animal for depth and rate of breathing and with a toe pinch every 5 min throughout the procedure to ensure the absence of pain.",
    "Upon completion of surgery, remove the animal from the stereotaxic frame. Administer a subcutaneous injection of saline (3 mL), ampicillin (0.15–0.2 mg/kg), and banamine (2.5–5 mg/kg) to provide analgesia and fluid support. Transfer the animal to a heated incubator to maintain body temperature.\n3. Surgical approach\nPlace the rat (7–8 weeks of age, Fischer 344 strain) in a head stereotaxic frame and on top of a heated pad. Position the stereotaxic frame with the rat head facing the surgeon’s left and center the left orbit in the surgical field of view.\nTo the left eye apply a drop of proparacaine and clean the eye by applying 5% povidone-iodine to the eyelid and the eye. Spread ophthalmic ointment on the cornea of both eyes to maintain corneal moisture and prevent cataract formation.\nPass a 4–0 polyglactin suture through the epidermis of the upper eyelid to the central aspect of the eyelid margin, using this suture for a temporary tarsorrhaphy in later steps. Use the suture to evert the eyelid and expose the superior fornix.\nTape the polyglactin suture to the stereotaxic frame to apply constant traction and exposure. Avoid excessive traction as this can limit exposure of the retroorbital contents.\nUsing Colibri forceps, elevate the superior conjunctiva and incise the conjunctiva along the limbus with a pair of Vannas scissors. Make a 4 o’clock peritomy along the superior limbus.\nApply slight inferior traction to the globe by placing a looped polypropylene suture along the superior limbus with the free ends below the globe. Residual tissue along the superior limbus following the peritomy is sufficient to provide traction on the suture loop without needing to pass the suture through the sclera or limbus.",
    "Secure the ends of the loop with a bulldog clamp and allow the clamp to dangle freely in midair. The weight of the clamp will apply inferior traction on the globe and expose more of the retroorbital space.\nBlunt dissect with Vannas scissors along the sclera following the posterior aspect of the globe and under the superior rectus. Disinsert the superior rectus muscles from the globe by cutting the muscle tendon with Vannas scissors to access the retroorbital space.\n4. Accessing the optic nerve\nBlunt dissect with Dumont #5/45 forceps along the temporal aspect of the posterior globe and identify the superior lateral vortex vein. Further blunt dissect nasal to the superior lateral vortex vein to expose the orbital muscle cone around the optic nerve and avoid prematurely damaging the optic nerve. Avoid injuring the vortex vein as this can cause significant bleeding. If bleeding occurs, a cotton tip applicator can be applied until the bleeding stops.\nUsing the Dumont #5/45 forceps, carefully insert the tip into the temporal aspect of the orbital muscle cone and open the forceps parallel to the course of the muscle fibers to reveal the optic nerve. Use the forceps to laterally displace the muscle fibers overlying the optic nerve and fully expose the nerve. Ensure that only the optic nerve sheath is covering the optic nerve as residual muscle fibers will prevent the pulled glass capillary pipette from easily piercing into the optic nerve.\nMaintain exposure of the nerve by placing two Dumont #5/45 forceps along both lateral aspects of the nerve and opening the forceps. The amount of exposure should allow for the optic nerve to be crushed 1.5–2.0 mm posterior to the globe and for a pulled glass capillary pipette to be inserted into the optic nerve from the dorsal aspect.",
    "5. Transecting the optic nerve inside the optic sheath\nUsing Dumont #5/45 forceps, place the tips on either side of the optic nerve at least 1.5–2.0 mm posterior to the globe. Ensure the tips of the forceps span the diameter of the nerve. Completely close the forceps for 5 s to crush the optic nerve and make note of the position of the crush site.\nWith a microliter syringe, fill a glass pulled capillary pipette with 1–2 µL of PBS and attach the pipette to a pipette holder. Mount the pipette holder to a micromanipulator and attach the micromanipulator onto the stereotaxic frame.\nAdjust the microinjection system to deliver a single pulse of 4 ms duration at a pressure of 20 psi with each push of the button. Position the pipette into the surgical field.\nUnder the surgical scope, use a pair of #55 forceps to break and bevel the pipette tip to a size (~20–30 µm diameter) capable of delivering a small volume but large enough to provide sufficient rigidity to penetrate the optic nerve sheath. Confirm patency of the pipette tip by giving a single pulse and observing for fluid at the pipette tip.\nRefine the position of the pipette tip to just above the site of the optic nerve crush in the center of the optic nerve and in contact with the optic nerve sheath. Note the vertical position of the pipette on the micromanipulator to later determine a depth of 200 µm.",
    "Lower the pipette while observing the tip under the surgical scope until the pipette enters the optic nerve. If the pipette tip bends and lacks the rigidity to penetrate the optic nerve sheath, retract the pipette and use a pair of #55 forceps to decrease the length and increase the diameter of the pipette tip. Once adjustments to the pipette tip have been made, reattempt to penetrate the optic nerve sheath with the pipette.\nUpon entry into the optic nerve with the pipette tip, retract the pipette if necessary. The position of the pipette tip, as indicated by the stereotaxic micromanipulator, should be 200 µm below the surface of the optic nerve from the initial position noted in step 5.5.\nWhile observing the optic nerve under the surgical scope, apply pulses of hydrostatic pressure with the microinjection system. As pulses are applied, a linear separation between the distal and proximal ends of the optic nerve should be noted to verify transection of the optic nerve.\n\tNOTE: Injection volume of 250–500 nL is generally sufficient to provide the force necessary to transect the optic nerve. Injections requiring more than 1 µL may indicate a need to reposition the injection site. Larger volumes injected into the intact parenchyma may not cause additional RGC damage given the method completely transects the optic nerve but is more likely to track along the fascicles of the optic nerve. Failure to observe a linear transection of the optic nerve despite injection of a sufficient fluid volume likely indicates mispositioning of the pipette at the crush site and a need for repositioning. A 50% increase in the injection pressure may also be necessary.\n6. Closing and recovery",
    "Retract the pipette and remove the retracting Dumont #5/45 forceps. Return the eye to a neutral position by removing the bulldog clamp and looped polypropylene suture from the globe.\nReposition the conjunctiva to the corneal limbus, insuring to release any conjunctiva that has inverted to allow for proper apposition of the tissue and healing. Apply ophthalmic topical antibiotic ointment to the eye.\nRemove the tape from the eyelid 4–0 polyglactin suture and maintain the suture in place to use for a temporary tarsorrhaphy. Pass the suture through the eyelid margin of the lower eyelid, through the subcuticular area inferiorly, and exiting through the epidermis. Tie the suture with just enough pressure to close the eye.\nAdminister postsurgical analgesics according to institutional protocols and animal care authority guidelines. House the animal independently in a heated cage to recover after surgery. Do not place bedding in the recovery cage to prevent accidental aspiration."
