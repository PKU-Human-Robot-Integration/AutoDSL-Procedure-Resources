    "1. Transformation, expression, and purification of scaffold protein component\nBL21 bacterial transformation with apoE4-NT containing plasmid\n\t\nThaw a tube of BL21 (DE3) competent cells on ice for 10 min.\nOnce all the ice has melted, mix gently and carefully pipette 50 µL of the cells into a transformation tube on ice.\nAdd 5 µL containing 50 ng of plasmid DNA (for sequence, see Supplemental Table 1) to the cell mixture. Carefully flick the tube four or five times to mix. Do not vortex.\nPlace the mixture on ice for 30 min.\nHeat shock the mixture at exactly 42 °C for 10 s.\nPlace on ice for 5 min.\nPipette 950 µL of S.O.C. medium into the tube at room temperature.\nPlace the tube in a 37 °C shaking incubator for 60 min with oscillation set to 250 rpm.\nMix the cells thoroughly by flicking and inverting, then spread 100 µL of cell solution onto a 20 mL Luria Broth + Agar selection plate treated with ampicillin at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL.\nIncubate overnight at 37 °C, or until visible colonies have grown.\nUsing an electronic pipettor, transfer 25 mL of sterile, NZCYM medium into a sterile 250 mL conical flask at room temperature and add ampicillin to a final working concentration of 0.1 mg/mL.\nUsing a sterile inoculation loop, transfer one individual colony from the selection plate containing the appropriately transformed bacterial strain and add directly to the flask containing 25 mL of NZCYM media + ampicillin.\nPlace the 25 mL of NZCYM seed culture flask into a 37 °C shaking incubator with orbital oscillation set to 250 rpm.",
    "NOTE: It is recommended that this seed culture be grown overnight to reach a suitable bacterial concentration (~1.5-2.0 optical density units), as measured using a spectrophotometer set to wavelength = 600 nm.\nTransfer 250 mL of sterile NZCYM medium into four 1 L baffled flasks and add ampicillin antibiotic to a working concentration of 0.1 mg/mL.\nUnder sterile conditions, transfer 5 mL of saturated seed culture into each of the four 250 mL culture containing flasks and place in a 37 ˚C shaking incubator with orbital oscillation set to 250 rpm.\n\tNOTE: At this point, the culture will be referred to as an expansion culture and exponential growth will be monitored using a UV1800 spectrophotometer. Growth is allowed to proceed until the culture optical density at 600 nm (OD600) reaches a value between 0.6-0.8.\nOnce the expansion culture has reached the desired OD600 value of 0.6-0.8, add 59.6 mg of isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to each 250 ml culture containing flask for a final concentration of 1 mM to induce protein expression. At this point, the expansion culture is referred to as the expression culture. Commence expression for a period of 5 h.\nAt the end of the 5 h expression period, remove the four flasks from the shaking incubator and pipette 125 mL into six 250 ml centrifuge bottles (750 mL total).\nBalance each centrifuge bottle to ensure the total mass is within ±0.5 mg of one another.\n\tNOTE: This step is essential to ensure safe operation of the centrifuge device.\nPrepare the centrifuge device by first flipping the power switch to the on position.

While DMSO is often used15,16,17,18,19, dimethylformamide20,21 or tetrahydrofuran22 have also been successfully employed23.\nPipette 0.5 mL of apoE4-NT scaffold protein (concentration of ~4 mg/mL) to the glass test tube containing the dispersed phospholipid and ampB. The final volume of the sample should be approximately 1 mL.\nBath sonicate the sample at 24 °C until the solution clarifies (generally 10-15 min).\nNanodisk centrifugation\n\t\nTransfer the clarified ampB-nanodisk solution to a sterile 1.7 mL micro-centrifuge tube.\nPlace the tube into a tabletop micro-centrifuge rotor with the addition of a balance tube placed directly opposite.\nTighten the rotor cap and close the centrifuge lid.\nProgram the centrifuge to spin for 10 min at ~11,000 x g using the corresponding dials located on the front of the micro-centrifuge unit.",
