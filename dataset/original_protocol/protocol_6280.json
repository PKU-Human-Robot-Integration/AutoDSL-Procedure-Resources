    "Reverse transfection and plating of cellsThe presented example is an experiment to determine if 10 μM of the BH3-mimetic ABT-263 can displace the BH3-only protein, Bad, from the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL in live cells (Figure 1). The acceptor fluorescent protein is fused to the N-terminus of Bad (Venus-Bad), while the donor fluorescence protein is fused to the N-terminus of Bcl-XL (mCer3-Bcl-XL). Our cell line of choice is baby mouse kidney (BMK) cells genetically deficient for the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak (BMK-dko cells, Liu et al., 2019) stably expressing mCer3-Bcl-XL. These cells are resistant to apoptotic stimuli, and thus tolerate higher expression of pro-apoptotic proteins and higher concentrations of apoptotic inducing agents like BH3-mimetics. It is worth noting that a wide range of different cell lines and proteins can be used with this protocol. Our laboratory has previously used MCF-7 and HCT-116 cell lines. Additionally, we use a wide range of different proteins, both pro-apoptotic (Bad, Bim, tBid, Puma, Noxa, etc.) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-XL, Bcl-2, Bcl-w, and Mcl-1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191015/20191015002603_4097.jpgFigure 1. Overview of FLIM-FRET in live cells. The donor fluorescence protein (mCer3) alone has a measured lifetime of 3.8 ns. In close proximity to the acceptor fluorescent protein, Venus, the lifetime for mCer3 decreases, indicative of Förster resonance energy transfer. The BH3-mimetic ABT-263 binds to Bcl-XL, displacing and/or preventing protein interactions. When fully displaced, the fluorescence lifetime for mCer3 returns to 3.8 ns. Partial displacement results in intermediate fluorescence lifetimes enabling estimation of relative binding affinities.The following conditions are for the transfection of 2 wells in a 384-well format plate (~10,000 cells per well). In a sterile tissue-culture hood, put 10 μl of Opti-MEMTM into a sterile 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tube, then add 200 ng of plasmid DNA with the Venus-Bad gene.",
    "Vortex the mixture, ensuring the small volume of 10 μl falls back to the bottom of the tube.Note: Other plate types can be used, such as 6-well dishes and whole mount slides. However, we prefer using 384-well plates as less reagents are required per experiment. For all plate types, it’s critical that there is no background fluorescence from the plate and that the plate or chamber slide must be compatible with cell culture. Add 0.2 μl of Mirus TransIT-X2® then immediately vortex the mixture. Ensure a thorough vortex for up to 20 s. After mixing, ensure the small volume falls back to the bottom of the tube. Let the reaction sit at room temperature for approximately 10 min.While the transfection reaction sits, we often use this time to split and count the BMK-dko cells stably expressing our donor fluorescent protein (mCer3-Bcl-XL), as follows:Remove a 10 cm culture dish containing cells that are ~80% confluent from the incubator, and place it in the sterile tissue culture hood.Aspirate the DMEM media in the dish.Wash the cells with 10 ml of PBS and then remove the PBS using vacuum aspiration. Add 1 ml of 1x-Trypsin. Using your hands, tilt the 10 cm dish to ensure the 1 ml of Trypsin is evenly distributed. Place the 10 cm dish back into the 37 °C incubator, periodically checking on the plate (every few minutes) until it becomes visually apparent that the majority of cells have detached from the dish.When the cells are detached from the dish, add 4 ml of fresh DMEM media to the dish and gently pipette the cells up and down (~10 times) to disrupt large cell aggregates. Then place the suspended cells into a 15 ml falcon tube.",
    "Using a hemocytometer, count the number of suspended cells and express this value as (number of cells) per (1 μl). In our example experiment, we counted a total of 520 cells/μl.Since the prepared transfection is for 2-wells (of a 384 well plate), 2 x 104 cells in a total volume of 80 μl are required (this is 1 x 104 cells in a volume of 40 μl per well). Dilute a small fraction of your counted cell suspension to a final concentration of 250 cells/μl (2 x 104 cells divided by 80 μl volume).Take 80 μl of your suspended cells (at a concentration of 250 cells/μl) and when the 10 min incubation (Step A2) is complete, mix with the transfection reaction. Add 45 μl of this mixture to a single well of a PerkinElmer cellcarrier ultra 384-well plate (2 wells in total).Allow the cells to settle to the bottom of the plate by leaving the plate to rest flat in the tissue culture hood for approximately 10 min. Afterward, the plate should be placed in the 37 °C incubator.Approximately four hours after Step 6, remove the plate from the incubator and place in the sterile tissue culture hood.Remove all media from the wells, and replace with desired media containing the treatment of choice. In our example experiment, either media containing DMSO, or media containing 10 μM ABT-263 is added back to the wells of the 384-well plate.Return the plate back to the incubator, and wait 20 h.Calibrating the ISS-Alba systemTurn the ISS-Alba instrument on in the following order: computer, climate control unit (set at 25 °C), TI-PS100W power supply, Nikon TI-S-CON motorized stage control, Nikon Intensilight C-HGFIE, excitation boxes for 445 and 514 nm lasers (Ext.",
    "20 MHz), Detector box, Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope, A320 FastFLIM (91070 2012), on the computer load VistaVision Suite software, A512 3-Axis DAC controller, A403 scanning mirror driver (91032 1009), signal conditioning unit (98018 3001). Allow the entire apparatus to warm up for 30 min.Note: This protocol is not limited to the ISS-Alba microscope. Several other commercial and custom-built instruments can be used, but with differences in downstream image processing (Osterlund et al., 2019; Hirmiz et al., 2019). We recommend using confocal microscopy as many Bcl-2 family interactions occur on mitochondrial membranes, confocal microscopy allows you to achieve sub-cellular resolution interaction maps. For more accurate estimation of fluorescence lifetime, we also recommend single photon counting detectors. Single photon avalanche photo-diodes (SPADs) with single photon time correlated or time-gating capabilities are ideal. Frequency domain FLIM measurements can also be utilized but the data interpretation is less straight forward (Sun et al., 2012). Take the plate out of the incubator and add to an empty well ~60 μl of fluorescein at a concentration of 10 nM in 0.1 M NaOH (see Recipe below).Note: We often find day to day variability in the photon count, despite not making any changes to laser power or filters. As a result, we use this fluorescein sample as a reference point to ensure we consistently achieve the same photon counts as previous experiments. Additionally, we measure the mono-exponential lifetime of fluorescein as a control for the instrument. Lower the objective, and apply a small bead of water. Ensure the water resupply tube is in close proximity to the droplet. Place the 384-well plate into the holder on the microscope, and begin raising the objective until the water droplet makes contact with the bottom of the plate.",
    "Move the stage to a well containing cells, and use the brightfield to focus on the cells.Once focused on the cells, select “z-reset” on the microscope, and move 100 μm above the cells to ensure the focal plane in within the solution. Move the stage to the well containing fluorescein, turn off brightfield, cover the stage with a black dark fabric, and select L100 on the microscope to connect the light path to the detectors.Within the VistaVision software, select “TD-FLIM” under “Measurement” on the left hand side, this is time-domain FLIM using the method of time-correlated single photon counting (Osterlund et al., 2015).Note: Use Figure 2 as a reference for the correct buttons or location of certain settings within VistaVision. The red numbers indicate which step it’s referring to.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191015/20191015002655_7323.jpgFigure 2. Screenshot of VistaVision software for acquiring FLIM-FRET data. Note that red numbers within the figure refer to the corresponding step in the protocol.Next, set the 445 nm and 514 nm lasers to ~70%. We often cycle through the filters under “Motor Alignment” to ensure they are in their correct positions. Set Channel-2 to the 479/40 nm filter and Channel-1 to the 542/27 nm filter. Filter #1 is a multi-band filter which allows the light of three different wavelengths to pass, enabling the examination of the three most common fluorescent proteins (cerulean, green and red fluorescent protein). Filter #4 will pass the emission of Venus and reflect the light of mCer3, resulting in the signal of Venus for Channel-1 (Ch1) and mCer3 for Channel-2 (Ch2).Under the “Multi-well Plate” tab, select the correct plate-map configuration as your experiment. For ours, we are using a 384 well plate from Corning as it works for the PerkinElmer plate.",
    "Under “Device Monitor”, select the small microscope icon, and select Alba to direct light from the microscope to the instrument.Select the green circle directly below to open the shutters. You should now be able to see the photon counts from Ch1 and Ch2 directly below. We often strive to achieve photon counts between 1 x 105 – 1.5 x 105 for both channels by adjusting the laser power or using the “Motor Alignment” to adjust the pin hole location. Using either one of these tools to achieve consistent photon counts between experiments means the data collected from multiple experiments can be directly comparable. Record the photon counts for Ch1 and Ch2 then uncheck the green circle to close the shutters.The next step is to ensure we are measuring the correct lifetime for fluorescein. Under the “Scan Settings” tab, change the pixel dwell time to 0.5 (ms), and averaging mode set to “none”. Also, uncheck both “Position Series” and “Macro Position series” directly below.Click “filename” and enter the name of “reference”.Finally click “Start”. A new window should appear on the right-hand side. After image acquisition, please follow Steps A3-A6 under Data Analysis, A. VistaVision Analysis, to check if the instrument can correctly measure fluorescein’s lifetime (4 +/- 0.1 ns). In addition to lifetime, we also use this fluorescein image to check for homogeneity of intensity. Being a pure solution of fluorescein, we expect the intensity to be homogenous, or at the very least, well centered. If it’s not, you may consider changing the X and Y position for the field of view as seen in step 16 of Figure 1.Live cell image acquisition on ISSNote: From this step we enter the process to collect data for cells and regions of interest.",
    "Next, on the microscope turn on the brightfield, reset the stage from 100 back to 0 (focal height of cells), and move to your most top-left well containing your cells (Since the stage moves left to right, up to down to collect data). Confirm you are focused on your cells in the most top-left view within the most top-left well using the eyepiece and brightfield. Press “Zero reset” on the microscope, select “Scanner Auto-Focus” to lock the focal plane. Finally, press “L100” to switch from the brightfield to the detector.Within VistaVision, select your wells of interest under “Macro Position Series” (always refer your starting well as A1) then your fields of view within each well under “Position series”.Select Z-reset under the “Stage and scanners” tab, then check “Use Scanner Auto-Focus”.Finally, change the file name to a name that makes sense to store your data (for example the name of the cells and experiment) and click “start”. By the end of the experiments, a “. iss” file will be automatically stored in your selected path.Be sure to check the water supply has enough reservoir for the time of image acquisition."
