    "Wash hRBCs as follows:After receiving blood (bag containing approximately 500 mL of total blood) from a donation center, mix gently by inverting the bag 2–3 times. Aliquot blood samples into 50 mL centrifuge tubes and store at 4 °C until washing. Unwashed blood can be stored at 4 °C for up to one month.To wash an aliquot of blood, use incomplete DMEM or RPMI media. Use roughly four volumes of medium per one volume of packed RBCs. Mix the suspension gently to resuspend the RBCs and centrifuge at 1,800 rpm (757 × g) for 10 min at room temperature (RT).Note: For washing RBCs, DMEM/RPMI from any source can be used. Following centrifugation, gently aspirate the medium and carefully remove the buffy coat containing the white blood cells from the top RBC layer. Repeat the washing steps twice.After the final wash, add an equal volume of incomplete DMEM or RPMI media to make 50% hematocrit (HC).The washed RBCs (50% HC) can be immediately used for in vitro culture or stored at 4 °C for further use. Washed RBCs can be stored at 4 °C and used for up to two weeks in cell culture.Thawing cryo-preserved B. duncani–infected erythrocytes:Take a cryovial of frozen parasite from the liquid nitrogen and immediately put in a 37 °C water bath for a few seconds until the contents of the vial turn into liquid.Transfer the contents of the thawed vial containing the B. duncani–infected hRBCs to a 50 mL centrifuge tube inside the biosafety cabinet.Add 200 μL of 12% (w/v) NaCl (0.2× original cryovial volume) dropwise while gently shaking the tube. Incubate for 5 min at RT.Add 9 mL of 1.6% (w/v) NaCl dropwise while gently shaking the tube.Centrifuge at 1,500 rpm (526 × g) for 5 min at RT.",
    "Remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.Add 25 mL of the incomplete DMEM/F-12 medium to wash the parasite pellet. Centrifuge at 1,500 rpm (526 × g) for 5 min at RT.Repeat the above step one more time and resuspend the pellet in 3.6 mL of complete DMEM/F-12 media (see Recipes). Add 400 μL of washed 50% HC A+ RBCs (step 2) to maintain culture at 5% HC.Seed the culture into a well of 6-well plate and place it in the incubator at 2% O2, 5% CO2, and 93% N2 atmosphere with 95% humidity setting (see Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4549/bioprotoc-12-22-4549-g003.jpgFigure 3. Representative image of Tri gas incubator used for B. duncani in vitro culture Maintain the culture as follows:Replace culture medium every day by aspirating old medium with aspirating pipette and replace with complete DMEM/F-12 medium prewarmed to 37 °C.Note: Take extra precaution while aspirating the medium to not disturb the bottom of the plate containing the iRBCs. Monitor the culture and P level by smear preparation as follows:Aspirate medium as described above and resuspend culture in fresh medium by gently pipetting a few times.Take 50 μL culture in a microcentrifuge tube and spin at 2,500 rpm (700 × g) for 2 min at RT.Carefully remove supernatant with a 200 μL pipette tip (set to 40 μL), leaving behind 10 μL of medium. Resuspend RBCs pellet by gently pipetting a few times.Place a drop of the resuspended RBCs on a slide and make a smear by sliding another slide at an angle of 25°–45° as shown in Figure 4.Fix the blood smear for 10 s in the fixative solution I followed by 10 s in solution II. Stain with the solution III for 25 s.",
    "Rinse the stained slide in water, air dry, and visualize the slide under the light microscope at 100× (representative image of blood smear with 10% P shown in Figure 5).Estimate P as follows:Make a smear from in vitro culture and perform Giemsa staining as described above in steps i–v.Air dry for 3–4 min. Put a drop of immersion oil and visualize under microscope.Count iRBCs and total RBCs (tRBCs) (tRBCs = iRBCs + uninfected RBCs) in the field.Repeat step 3 for different fields until the tRBCs count from adding all the fields is 1,000–2,000 RBCs (for more accuracy).Calculate percentage of iRBCs as follows:Field 1=(9 iRBCs)/(80 tRBCs) Field 2=(10 iRBCs)/(110 tRBCs) Field 3=(11 iRBCs)/(120 tRBCs) Field 5=(8 iRBCs)/(70 tRBCs) Field 6=(12 iRBCs)/(130 tRBCs)(9+10+11+8+12)/(80+110+120+70+130)= 50/510×100=9.8% imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4549/bioprotoc-12-22-4549-g004.jpgFigure 4.

Representative image depicting 10% P of B. duncani–infected human erythrocytes Note: Increasing the number of fields for calculating the proportion of iRBCs and tRBCs and percentage of P levels allows a more accurate determination of P. Maintain the parasite culture by inoculating 0.5%–1% P of original culture once the P level reaches 10%–15%.Example: For a starter culture of 5 mL with 0.5% P and 5% HC, take 250 μL of the stock culture (10% P and 5% HC) and add 475 μL of 50% HC washed hRBCs and 4.275 mL of complete DMEM/F-12 medium.For specific assays that require high P, culture the parasites continuously with media replacement after every 24 h until it reaches the desired P. B. duncani in vitro cultures can reach up to 20%–25% P.Cryopreservation of in vitro cultured B.",
    "duncani–iRBCs Estimate P levels by light microscopy following Giemsa staining of blood smears prepared from in vitro cultured parasites as described in step A4a if P is >5%, then proceed with the following steps of cryopreservation.Pellet the culture (5 mL) by centrifugation at 1,800 rpm for 5 min at RT.Aspirate the supernatant leaving behind the RBC pellet.Add 250 μL of filter-sterilized glycerolyte dropwise while tapping the bottom of the tube to mix.Gently mix the suspension and put in a cryovial. Label the cryovial describing the parasite strain and % P of the culture on the day of cryopreservation.Store the cryovial at -80 °C.For long-term storage (more than six months), take out the cryovial from -80 °C and place in liquid nitrogen.Purification of B. duncani merozoites Initiate and maintain B. duncani in vitro culture in hRBCs in DMEM/F-12 medium until P reaches 18%–20% and free merozoite can be observed in blood smears (Figure 6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4549/bioprotoc-12-22-4549-g006.jpgFigure 6. Representative image depicting 18%–20% P with free merozoites indicated by arrows To isolate the free merozoites, centrifuge the parasite culture at 1,800 rpm (757 × g) and 37 °C for 5 min.Use the pellet containing the B. duncani iRBCs for initiating fresh starter cultures or for other assays. The supernatant containing the free merozoites is collected using a pipette in a fresh centrifuge tube.The supernatant is centrifuged at 4,000 rpm (1,932 × g) and 37 °C for 10 min. The resulting pellet contains the free merozoites.Resuspend the merozoite pellet in warm DMEM/F-12 in 1:5 ratio (v/v). For example, for a packed pellet of 10 μL, add 50 μL of culture medium.Estimate the purity of the merozoites by Giemsa staining. The purity of a merozoite preparation is determined by the amount of free merozoites with little to no intact uninfected or infected RBCs.",
    "Figure 7 shows an example of a merozoite preparation with no RBCs detected. The merozoite preparations that are more than 95% pure are considered suitable for subsequent cell biological and molecular analyses.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4549/bioprotoc-12-22-4549-g007.jpgFigure 7. Representative image showing free merozoites (black arrows). Pink structures in the image represent RBC membranes resulting from lysis of infected erythrocytes.Mouse infection Use 5–6 weeks old female C3H/HeJ mice after one week acclimatization post procurement.To infect mouse, use either B. duncani in vitro cultured purified merozoites (2 × 107) or human iRBCs (8.5 × 105) and inject by retro-orbital intravenous (IV) route.Note: Higher doses of parasite infection will expedite the establishment of infection in mouse. However, results may vary depending on the success of infection and handling. Calculate the amount of ihRBCs containing 8.5 × 105 parasites as follows:Calculation of iRBCs in the in vitro culture:1 mL of human blood = 5 × 109 RBCs (100% HC)1 mL of 5% HC human blood = 2.5 × 108 RBCsIf the P estimated by Giemsa stain is 10%1 mL of 5% HC with 10% P = 10/100 × 2.5 × 108 = 2.5 × 107 iRBCsTake the desired amount of parasite (8.5 × 105) by serial dilution as follows:Take 100 μL of above culture (step D3a) containing 2.5 × 106 iRBCs and dilute 1:10 by adding 900 μL of 1× PBS to attain a concentration of 2.5 × 103 parasites per μL.For 8.5 × 105 parasites from above diluted culture, take 340 μL (8.5 × 105 ÷ 2.5 × 105 = 340 μL) and pellet down by centrifugation at 1,800 rpm (757 × g) for 5 min at RT. Carefully aspirate the supernatant leaving behind 100 μL of supernatant.Resuspend by gentle tapping and inject as described below in step D5.",
    "Note: A serial dilution to take the desired amount of parasite is important, rather than taking a very little amount (e.g., 34 μL) directly from original culture (to avoid pipetting error). Perform IV infection as follows:Use a jar with cotton soaked in 30% isoflurane (inhalation anesthetic) diluted in PEG 400 placed at the bottom and covered with a mesh. Place a single mouse inside the sealed chamber containing the above-mentioned inhalation anesthetic (see Figure 8).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4549/bioprotoc-12-22-4549-g008.jpgFigure 8. Representative image showing reagents and materials required for mouse infection Inject 100 μL of parasite (in PBS) diluted as mentioned above in step D3b and inject via IV route.Monitor P by microscopy of thin blood smears prepared from blood collected from the tail vein on a regular interval of 24 or 48 h. Plot the P and survival curve using GraphPad Prism.Blood from an infected mouse can be used to infect another uninfected mouse to maintain the parasite stock. Parasitemia in the stock mouse can be monitored by microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood smears.Calculate the amount of blood required for mouse-to-mouse infection:Calculation of iRBCs1 mL of mouse blood = 10 × 109 RBCsIf P (estimated by Giemsa stain) is 10%1 mL of 10% P = 10/100 × 10 × 109 = 109 iRBCsDilution of iRBCsIf the desired dose of infection is 104 parasites, collect 30 μL of blood from the mouse by retroorbital bleeding in a heparinized blood collection tube and dilute as follows:Take 10 μL of blood (1.0 × 107 iRBCs) and add 990 μL of 1× PBS to make 1 × 107 iRBC/mL.Dilute above diluted iRBCs to 1:10 for two more times by taking 100 μL each time from previous dilution and adding 900 μL of 1× PBS (serial dilution).",
    "This will result in 1 mL containing 1 ×105 iRBCs (102 iRBCs/μL) at final step. Use 100 μL (1 × 104 iRBC) of this dilution to inject each mouse.Notes:  1. Calculate the dose for N+2 mice to account for any volume loss. Infection from mouse to mouse is established faster than from in vitro culture to mouse (see Pal et al., 2022). 2. A dose response infection (ranging from 102–107 iRBCs) was tested in mouse-to-mouse transmission of B. duncani and successful infection was achieved at all doses (Pal et al., 2022). Compared to higher doses, subsequent lower doses led to delays in the establishment of infection. However, results may vary depending on the handling. Any animal showing signs of distress should be humanely euthanized per approved IACUC protocol by CO2 asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation."
