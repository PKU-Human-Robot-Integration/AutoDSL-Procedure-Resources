Schematic representation of steps for construction of asRNA mediated gene knockdown mutant in Anabaena. Abbreviations: Km, Kanamycin; Neo12.5, Neomycin (12.5 µg/ml); Neo25, Neomycin (25 µg/ml); npt, neomycin phosphotransferase; bla, beta-lactamase; cat, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase.Note: The handling of cyanobacterial cultures should be done exclusively under sterile conditions. DNA manipulationDesign primers for (a) promoter e.g., PpsbA1 (alr4866; encoding Photosystem II protein D1) and (b) target gene in reverse orientation (hereafter asGENE) and amplify the DNA fragments by PCR. All the steps in this section are illustrated in Figure 1A. The primers can be designed either manually or using programs such as Geneious (https://www.geneious.com[href=https://www.geneious.com/]). Primers used for construction and confirmation of knock-down mutant of alr0277 gene in Anabaena (Srivastava et al., 2017) are listed in Table 1.Note: In this protocol, use of the Gibson assembly, as described by the manufacturer (Gibson et al., 2009), was employed. Primer designing in the Gibson assembly method does not require the addition of restriction sites in primers.Table 1.

Measure the concentration and purity of the purified fragments on a NanoDrop instrument.Combine promoter, asGENE and linearized plasmid (pAM1956-XmaI), in the Gibson assembly reaction (contains the enzymes: T5 Exonuclease, Phusion DNA Polymerase and Taq DNA Ligase) and follow the manufacturer's instructions.Transform the ligation mix into competent E. coli HB101, spread on a LB agar plate (1.5% agar) supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and wait for the colonies to grow overnight at 37 °C. The competent E.",
    "coli HB101 cells can be prepared by treatment with CaCl2 (Sambrook et al., 2006).Once the colonies have appeared, they can be confirmed by colony-PCR by using the forward primer of PpsbA1 and the reverse primer of asGENE.Construction of recombinant Anabaena strainGrow Anabaena in 25 ml BG11 medium (Rippka et al., 1979) (Recipe 1) under continuous light illumination (40 μmol photons/m2/s) at 30 °C and shaking at 150 rpm for 4-5 days until it is in the exponential phase (OD730 ~0.5). All the steps in this section are illustrated in Figure 1B.Collect the cells by centrifugation at 4,000 x g for 10 min at room temperature and resuspend the cell pellet in 25 ml BG11 media in a 150 ml Erlenmeyer flask.Break filaments by sonicating the cultures for 60-120 s, using a water bath sonicator to an average 3-5 cell length and confirm it by bright field microscopy.Grow the broken filaments for one day under continuous light illumination (40 μmol photons/m2/s) at 30 °C and shaking at 150 rpm.On the same day, inoculate the colonies of E. coli HB101 bearing the cargo plasmid (KmR), which has been constructed in the step 5 (section A), and E. coli HB101-R2 harboring pRL443 (ApR) and pRL623 (CmR) in 2 ml LB broth with 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 100 μg/ml ampicillin + 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol respectively for 12-16 h at 37 °C at 200 rpm.Next day, sub-inoculate 100 μl of the overnight-grown cultures of the above-mentioned E. coli strains into 5 ml of fresh LB liquid media supplemented with appropriate antibiotics and allow them to grow until they reach an exponential phase (OD600 ~0.5).Harvest the 5 ml culture by centrifugation at 4,000 x g in a table centrifuge for 10 min at 25 °C (room temperature).",
    "Wash the cell pellets three times with 1 ml LB to remove antibiotics completely, and then add 200 μl LB to re-suspend the pellets in both. Do not vortex the cells and if required, use a sterile pipette to gently re-suspend the E. coli cells.For the mating experiment, mix 100 μl HB101 bearing the cargo plasmid with 100 μl HB101-R2 (harboring pRL443 and pRL623) and incubate at room temperature for 30 min (experimental group). For negative control, mix 100 μl LB with 100 μl HB101-R2 and incubate at room temperature for 30 min (control group).Note: We have used an E. coli strain (HB101) that contains both plasmids pRL443 and pRL623, which differs from the original method (Elhai and Wolk, 1988) where one strain contains conjugal plasmid (pRL443), and other strain contains the helper plasmid (pRL623) and the cargo plasmid. The same day, harvest 15 ml Anabaena culture by centrifugation at 4,000 x g for 10 min at room temperature. Re-suspend the cell pellet in 1 ml BG11, transfer the cells into a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, and then centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 1 min at room temperature. Re-suspend the pellet in 400 μl of 2x BG11; then divide cells equally into two tubes.Mix 200 μl of Anabaena resuspension with 200 μl of the mated E. coli mixture (experimental group) or the control mixture (control group), respectively, and incubate at room temperature and low light (20 μmol photons/m2/s) overnight.Spread the conjugal mixtures onto the autoclaved Supor® PES Membrane Disc Filters (Supor-800, 0.8 μm, 47 mm) placed on BG11 agar plate (1.5% agar, Recipe 2) containing 12.5 μg/ml neomycin and incubate at 30°C, with continuous low light illumination (20 μmol photons/m2/s).",
    "Transfer the membrane to a fresh BG11 agar plate (25 μg/ml neomycin) every fourth day until neomycin-resistant colonies gradually appear after 15-20 days.Observe the Anabaena colonies under a fluorescent microscope and select the colonies emitting GFP fluorescence (100x/1.3 oil objective lens, an excitation filter BP 470/40 nm and emission filter BP 525/50 nm) for further experiments.Pick up the desired colony with a sterile inoculation loop or a toothpick and inoculate into a sterile glass tube (3-4 ml total volume) containing 250 μl of BG11 medium with 25 μg/ml neomycin. Keep this tube under continuous low light illumination (20 μmol photons m2/s). After 3-4 days, once the visual increase in growth is observed, add another 250-500 μl of BG11 medium (25 μg/ml neomycin). Once the OD730 of this culture reaches 0.3-0.4, transfer cells into 5 ml of BG11 medium (in a 25 ml sterile glass tube) containing neomycin as mentioned above. Now the tube can be placed under continuous light illumination of 40 μmol photons/m2/s. After sufficient growth is observed (OD730 ~0.6-1.0), cells can be transferred to a 150 ml sterile Erlenmeyer flask containing 25 ml BG11 medium (25 μg/ml neomycin). Now cells can be subcultured as required in the above-mentioned medium for routine maintenance or for performing experiments. All these steps can be performed at 24-26 °C.Confirmation of expression of asRNA and downregulation of target geneTo confirm the expression of asRNA by a semi-quantitative PCR approach, design the forward primer internal to asGENE and reverse primer internal to gfpmut2 gene. To confirm the downregulation of the target gene, design the forward primer from the upstream sequence of the target gene that is present in the genome but absent in the antisense construct so that it can be selectively amplified from cDNA derived from GENE mRNA and not from its asRNA.",
    "All the steps in this section are illustrated in Figure 1C.Note: A regular PCR was used for amplification after the reverse transcriptase reaction. However, qRT-PCR can also be employed to evaluate differences in the expression of mRNA between the wild-type and the knockdown strain, which is a more sensitive technique. Alternatively, if antibodies against the proteins that are knocked down are available, then Western blotting may also be employed to monitor the reduction in the protein content. Filter 20 ml of exponential phase (OD730 ~0.5) Anabaena culture on the membrane filter (Supor® PES membrane disc filters-supor-800, 0.8 μm, 47 mm) using a vacuum pump assembly for harvesting the cells. Alternatively, cells may be also harvested by centrifugation (4,000 x g, 10 min) and reagents such as TRI Reagent (Sigma)/Trizol (Invitrogen) may be used to isolate total RNA using the manufacturer’s protocol.Insert the filter containing cells in the vial containing PGTX solution (see Recipes) using tweezers and vortex until the filter is broken into small flakes and mixed with phenol properly. Keep samples on ice.Freeze the samples in liquid nitrogen immediately, store at -80 °C and perform the RNA extraction exactly as described by Pinto et al. (2009).Detect the RNA on a denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel (1.5-2.0% w/v agarose). After staining with ethidium bromide, intact total RNA on migration will show sharp, clear 23S and 16S rRNA bands. Measure the RNA concentration and purity using the NanoDrop instrument as described by the manufacturer.Treat the RNA (usually 1:10 dilution of original stock) with the DNase I enzyme and subsequently inactivate the DNase I by DNase inactivation reagent according to the manufacturer’s instruction.DNA contamination of RNA preparations is not necessarily detected by gel electrophoresis or similar methods.",
    "To test if a detectable amount of genomic DNA is absent, use the diluted RNA sample as a template for PCR using primer pairs for a constitutive gene rnpB. Measure the RNA concentration and purity using the NanoDrop instrument.Prepare cDNA using Reverse transcriptase with 1 μg of RNA as template and 0.5 μM of random primers, following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR amplify a small fragment of the housekeeping gene rnpB as a control and target gene using specific primers in different PCR reactions, increasing the number of cycles from 25 to 36.Detect the PCR products on an agarose gel and document the image.Measure the intensity of PCR bands using ImageJ software for comparison of the transcript level."
