    "The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the Istanbul Faculty of Medicine. Written consent was obtained from the patients before the surgical procedure.\n1. Preoperative procedures\nPerform the procedure under general anesthesia with an anesthetist. Set the endoscopic and optic instruments, and C-arm devices in the operation room.\nEnsure the following tools are available for the procedure; dilator, working sleeve, endoscope with a 20° viewing angle, Kerrison punch, ronguer, punch, tip control radioblator probe that applies a radiofrequency current of 4 MHz, fluid conrol irrigation, and suction pump devices.\n2. Technical note\nPosition of patient\n\t\nPlace the patient in a prone position (support the thorax and pelvis with pillows) with the hip and knee flexed to achieve a wider interlaminar space.\nPreparing the surgical field\n\t\nSterilize the lumbar region with iodine or chlorhexidine (10%).\nUse sterile sheets to outline the prepared surgical site.\nDrape the operation field and C-arm with a waterproof surgical drape.\nDetermine the entry point.\n\t\nObtain an anteroposterior (AP) X-ray view and mark the interlaminar space at the L5-S1 level (Figure 1A).\n\t\tNOTE: The C-arm is a device that can rotate 360° around the patient and obtain anteroposterior (AP) and lateral X-ray views intraoperatively.\nMark (with a sterile, surgical skin marker) as close to medial in the craniocaudal middle of the interlaminar window as possible for enough lateral access.\nIncision\n\t\nMake a 10 mm skin incision as close to the midline as possible with a 20-blade.\nCheck that the fascia of the paraspinal muscle has been passed.\nInsertion of the dilator\n\t\nInsert the dilator through the incision and laterally advance until it reaches the facet joint (Figure 1B).",
    "Obtain a lateral and AP X-ray view with the C-arm to confirm that the tip of the dilator is at the desired level and facing toward the facet joint of the ipsilateral pathology.\nInsertion of working sleeve\n\t\nSlide the working sleeve with the beveled opening toward the midline over the dilator.\nObtain a lateral X-ray view with the C-arm to confirm that the tip of the working sleeve has reached the end of the dilator.\nRemove the dilator.\nIntroduce the endoscope.\n\t\nIntroduce an endoscope with a continuous inflow of saline (0.9% sodium chloride) over the working sleeve until the interface of the ligamentum flavum and muscle (Figure 1C).\n\t\tNOTE: The flow rate is arranged by fluid control irrigation and suction pump devices. There is no specific rate flow. The surgeon can arrange the rate of flow to obtain optimum visualization.\nPerform the rest of the procedure with continuous irrigation. Fluid flow will keep the surgical field clear. Control any risk of bleeding with the fluid pressure and direct application of the cautery (RF 4 Mhz).\nExposure of ligamentum flavum\n\tNOTE: The first structures to be visualized after the endoscopic introduction should be at the interface of the ligamentum flavum and muscle.\n\t\nRemove the soft tissues using a rongeur until the ligament flavum is exposed (Figure 1D).\nPerform bone resection via a high-speed burr to achieve a wider interlaminar space if there is not a wide enough interlaminar window to fit the endoscope.\nResection of ligamentum flavum\n\t\nTense the ligamentum flavum with the long side of the working sleeve.\nSeparate the ligamentum flavum from the dura for a safer resection, as the dura is more prominent in the midline.\nBegin the ligamentum flavum resection from the medial side using a 5.4 mm punch.",
    "Control the cutting edge of the punch while the ligamentum flavum is being resected. Doing so otherwise risks a dural tear.\nContinue ligamentum flavum resection laterally until the lateral recess and pedicle are visualized to expose the nerve root and its lateral border (Figure 1E).\nDiscectomy\n\t\nRemove the epidural fat tissue totally using the rongeur for a clear view of the compression.\nMobilize the nerve root medially using the dissector to relieve it from any adhesions.\nRotate the long side of the working sleeve clockwise or counterclockwise to medialize the nerve root and expose the pathology (Figure 1F).\nVisualize the anterior epidural space, annular defect, disk interval, and end plates.\nRemove the migrated disc material and loosen the fragments under the annulus through the defect if they are present and visualized.\nUse the punch to open the posterior longitudinal ligament and the annulus fibrosis if there is a subligamentous protruding material.\nUse the rongeur to remove the disc material, after detecting the annular defect and disc material in both situations.\nUse the punch to obtain enough space if no annular defect is encountered or the annular defect is too narrow for sufficient removal.\nEvacuate the disc space with the rongeur or punch until achieving nerve root decompression.\nDuring the discectomy, do not perform excessive retraction, so as to prevent neural trauma. Intermittent release or de-rotation of the working sleeve is necessary to decrease neurological complications.\nAfter the discectomy, coagulate the defect of the annulus by bipolar electrocautery for sealing and hemostasis purposes.\nAchieve hemostasis in every procedure step with continuous fluid flow or bipolar electrocautery (RF 4 Mhz).\nRemove the endoscope and working sleeve.\nClose the incision with a single proline suture (2.0) without drainage.\n3. Postoperative procedures and follow-up",
    "The hospital stay is short, and mobilization is immediateon the day of surgery.\nDischarge the patients the next day if there are no complaints.\n\tNOTE: Rehabilitation and physical therapy are not necessary. Analgesics and rehabilitative measures are not primarily necessary.\nRecommend the patients to be admitted to an outpatient clinic in the 1st and 4th weeks.\nSubscription Required.
