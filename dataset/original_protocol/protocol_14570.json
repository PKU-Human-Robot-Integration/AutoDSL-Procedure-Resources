    "All studies were completed in accordance with regulatory and institutional guidelines. The animal aspects of this study were evaluated by the Kent Scientific Corporation Animal Use Program, approved by the Purdue Animal Care and Use Committee (PACUC), and performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals22.\nNote: The low-flow digital anesthesia system used in this protocol is equipped with an integrated pulse oximeter.\n1. Set Up the Low-flow Anesthesia System with Integrated Pulse Oximeter\nFor Isoflurane Delivery\n\t\nSelect a carrier gas source. To utilize the internal air pump, unscrew Inlet Port on back, allowing the internal pump to intake room air.\nConnect charcoal canister to exhaust port.\nConnect Y adapter to front of the low flow, digital anesthesia system. Use the color-coded clips to connect the white branches to the nose cone, and blue branches to the induction chamber.\nClose white clip clamps and open blue clip clamps to direct airflow to the chamber.\nSelect 2 ml syringe.\nFor Physiological Monitoring, Using the Integrated Pulse Oximeter\n\t\nConnect the pulse oximeter paw sensor to port on the back of the low-flow anesthesia system, labeled \"AUX\".\n2. Configure the Settings\nFor Anesthesia\n\t\nPower on the anesthesia system, and access the Set Up menu. Press Set Up to access Main Menu > Anesthesia > Setup in red.\nChoose the anesthetic agent. Press Set Up to highlight Type Anest in red. Use the Up and Down arrows to select Isoflurane.\nSet the syringe size. Press Set Up to highlight Syr Size. Use the Up and Down arrows to select a 2 ml syringe.",
    "Set the Empty Position. Press Set Up to highlight Set Empty in red. Secure empty, fully depressed glass syringe in the Syringe Retention Block by placing the syringe so that the Syringe Holding Clamp is seated on the metal collar of the syringe. Press the Up or Down arrows to move the Pusher Block so that the Pusher Block makes light contact with the top of the syringe plunger. Press select to set empty position.\nPress Set Up to highlight Remove in red. Remove the syringe and fill the syringe with isoflurane using the bottle top adapter.\nConnect the Syringe to the anesthesia system.\nPrime the anesthetic delivery tubing. Press Set Up to highlight Prime Tube in red. Press Down until the anesthetic travels through the syringe and into the black fitting on the vaporizer block.\nEnable anesthesia. Press Set Up to highlight Enable in red. Use the Up and Down arrows to select Yes. Press Run/Back to return to the Main Menu.\nSelect the air supply and minute volume. Press Set Up to highlight Air Supply in red. Use the Up and Down arrows to select Internal Pump. Press Set Up to highlight Minute Vol in red. Set flow rate to 250 ml/min.\nFor Physiological Monitoring\n\t\nSet the minimum detected heart rate to Mouse (240). Press Set Up to access Main Menu > MouseStat. Use up and down arrows to set minimum heart rate.\n3. Begin Anesthesia Delivery\nInduce the Mouse\n\t\nPress Run/Back twice to enter run mode and begin airflow.\nPlace the mouse in the induction chamber, closing the lid tightly. Adjust the Anesthetic Agent Concentration knob to 3%.\nMonitor until the mouse has reached the desired plane of anesthesia, determined by loss of righting reflex. Adjust the Anesthetic Agent Concentration as necessary.",
    "Once the animal loses its righting reflex and is sufficiently anesthetized, turn the Anesthesia concentration dial to 0%. The authors have previously found that allowing the airflow to flush the induction chamber 30-60 sec is sufficient to purge the chamber without reversing the anesthetic depth1.\nQuickly open the white clamps to direct the air to the facemask, and close the blue clamps leading to the induction chamber.\nOpen the chamber away from researcher, remove the mouse, and immediately fit the nose cone.\nCenter the animal on an infrared warming pad, set to maintain body temperature at 37 Â°C via a rectal probe on a feedback loop.\nWhen the mouse is stable on the nose cone, adjust the concentration of isoflurane to 1.5% or as needed for maintenance by turning the Anesthetic Agent Concentration knob.\nReduce minute volume for maintenance. The minimum flow rate to support the animal is equal to 1.5-2.2 times the animal's minute volume (for a 30 g mouse, a minimum of 52 ml/min). Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for a recommended flow rate setting specific to the nose cone style and adjust as necessary. Press Set Up to access the Main Menu, and then press Set Up until Minute Vol is highlighted in red. Use the Up and Down arrows to adjust target flow. Press Run/Back to return to the main screen.\nConfirm depth of anesthesia as determined by a lack of withdrawal reflex during an interdigital pinch. Apply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes to prevent dryness during anesthesia.\n4. Begin Physiological Monitoring",
    "Place sensor over pad of hind paw. Position the sensor so that the red light is beneath the paw and illuminates the paw. Use the up and down arrows on the screen to display the oxiwave. The animal is now safely anesthetized using a low flow, syringe-driven, digital vaporizer.\n5. Remove the Animal\nTurn Off the Anesthesia Delivery.\n\t\nTo stop the delivery of anesthetic, turn Anesthetic Agent Concentration knob to Min (or 0%) and remove animal from facemask.\nMonitor the mouse during anesthesia recovery. Once the mouse has become fully ambulatory, return it to the cage."
