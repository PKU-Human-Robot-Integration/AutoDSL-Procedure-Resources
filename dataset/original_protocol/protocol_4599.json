    "Euthanize the mouse with CO2 and place mouse onto a sterile surgical pad in a sterile hood. Sterilize the mouse abdomen area and skin of hindlimbs with 70% ethanol (Figure 1). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20151019/20151019054841_9711.jpgFigure 1. Sterilization of mouse abdomen area and skin of hindlimbsOpen the abdominal cavity with blunt-end sterile scissors and remove the surface muscles and find the pelvic-hip joint (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20151019/20151019055710_5320.jpgFigure 2. Find the pelvic-hip joint.

Cut off the tibia from the hind leg below the knee joint with sharp sterile scissors (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20151019/20151019055737_9100.jpgFigure 3.

Cut off the tibia at knee joint(Optional) If higher yield of bone marrow cells is needed, tibia can also be used for bone marrow cell isolation. Cut at the tibia ankle joint to dissect the tibia. The following procedures can be applied to both femur and tibia. Remove the muscles and residue tissues surrounding the femur with sterile forceps and scissors (Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20151019/20151019055041_8417.jpgFigure 5. Remove the muscles and residue tissues surrounding the femurCut the femurs at both ends with sharp sterile scissors (Figure 6). Use a 23-gauge (some literature suggests 25-or 26-gauge) needle and a 10 cc syringe filled with ice-cold HBSS to flush the bone marrow out onto a 70 µm nylon cell strainer placed in a 50 ml Falcon conical tube (Figure 7). Use all the 10 ml HBSS or until the flow through turns white.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20151019/20151019055110_8109.jpgFigure 6.

Flush the bone marrow onto the cell strainer with HBSS(Optional) In case some residue bone marrow cells could not be flushed off (very few bone marrow visible in the flow through or the yield is significantly less, e.g.",
    ", < 1 x 107 cells), scrape the inner surface of the femur with the needle and flush with extra ~5 ml HBSS (Figure 8).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20151019/20151019055206_8618.jpgFigure 8. (Optional) Scrape the inner surface of femur with needleSmash the bone marrow through the cell strainer with a 5 ml plunger (Figure 9). Wash the strainer with another ~5 ml HBSS.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20151019/20151019055238_1867.jpgFigure 9. Smash the bone marrow cells through the cell strainer with a 5 ml plungerCentrifuge cells at 1,500 rpm for 7 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant and blot on paper towel (Figure 10). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20151019/20151019055302_7411.jpgFigure 10. Cell pellet before RBC buffer resuspensionResuspend the cell pellet with 1 ml RBC lysis buffer (for each mouse). Incubate for 5 min at room temperature or 2 min at 37 °C, and neutralize the lysis buffer by adding 5 ml FBS.Centrifuge cells at 1,500 rpm for 7 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant and blot on paper towel. Resuspend the cell pellet with appropriate media for the next step of assay such as 5 ml DMEM medium containing 10% FBS. Cells are then placed on ice. Count the bone marrow cells with a hemocytometer or a Beckman Z2 coulter counter. Cells are ready for assays or culture. Cells can stay viable on ice for at least 5 h. It is recommended to perform the experiment (culture or assays) right after isolation for best results."
