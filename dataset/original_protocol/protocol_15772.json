NMR Methods",
    "NMR Sample Preparation\nPurify 15N-labeled wild-type or R1914E E-PRD protein as previously described using 20 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM DTT, pH 7 as the S buffer for step 2.2.6. Protein stock solutions usually range from 0.3 to 1 mM with volumes of about 1 mL.\n\t\tNOTE: Protein can be concentrated to >100 µM using a MWCO 3 kDa, 5 mL centrifugal ultrafiltration device to bring the concentration into a suitable range for sample preparation.\nPurify a sample of unlabeled VimRod protein using 20 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM DTT, pH 7 as the S buffer for step 2.1.10.\nIn a final volume of 500 µL, add wild-type or mutant E-PRD protein to a final concentration of 100µM, deuterium oxide (D2O) to a final concentration of 10% (v/v), and DSS (4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid) to a final concentration of 20 µM. Bring the sample volume up to 500 µL using 20 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM DTT, pH 7. A representative sample preparation is described in Table 4.\n\t\tNOTE: The 0 ppm resonance of DSS is used to calibrate the 1H chemical shifts as well as for indirect referencing of the 15N chemical shifts of the protein6. D2O is used for the deuterium lock signal to keep the spectrometer operating at a constant net magnetic field.\nMake up a second sample of E-PRD, D2O and DSS as in the previous step and add VimRod to a final concentration of 50 µM before bringing the volume up to 500 µL.\nTransfer the 500 µL samples to a 5 mm wide NMR tubes for the experiment.\nNMR Experimental Setup",
    "Turn on the air flow with the eject command “ej”; this will bring the sample up from the magnet. Now, place the sample within a spinner on top of the magnet by the opening and insert with the command “ij”. Wait until sample settles inside the magnet before proceeding.\nCreate a new dataset using the “edc” command and load standard 1H NMR parameters by selecting experiment “ZGPR” (Figure 1). Fill in the NAME, EXPNO (experiment number) and PROCNO (processed data folder number) fields. Select the solvent in the “Set solvent” field and click on “Execute ‘getprosol’” to read standard probehead and solvent dependent (prosol) parameters.\nLock the sample to the deuterated solvent, i.e., D2O, using command “lock” and wait until it is finished sweeping and achieves lock.\nCorrect the resonance frequency of the magnet by tuning the sample using the automatic tuning command “atma”. Monitor the wobble curve until the automatic tuning is complete.\nShim the magnetic field using TOPSHIM (command “topshim”). Shimming is process of adjustments to magnetic field to achieve uniformity around the sample. It is good practice to store the shim values with the command “wsh” and read them using “rsh” before topshim, if using the same or similar samples.\nAdjust the receiver gain with “rga” command to achieve maximum signal to noise ratio.\nPlace the center of the spectrum on the water resonance offset (o1) and set the 90 degree proton pulse (p1) at high power using “calibo1p1”.\nCollect the proton spectrum using the zero go “zg” command and process with “efp” which includes exponential multiplication (“em”), the free induction decay (FID) incorporating line broadening, “ft” fourier transformation of FID and “pk” to apply phase correction.\nApply the automatic phase correction “apk” and the automatic baseline correction “absn” using the polynomial without integration option.",
    "Create a new dataset (as in 3.2.2) for the SOFAST HMBC experiment by selecting “SFHMQC3GPPH” in experiment.\nCopy optimized P1 and O1 from proton spectrum and populate P1 dependent pulses by using command “getprosol 1H p1 plw1”, where p1 is the optimized P1 value and plw1 is the power level for P1.\nOptimize the CNST54 constant to set the offset for amide chemical shift and CNST55 to define the bandwidth in order to encompass the spectral regions of interest which allows the receiver gain to be optimized (Figure 2). To select these parameters, extract the first FID (free induction decay) from the two-dimensional spectrum and look for the observed signal to define them. In addition, vary the relaxation delay (D1), number of scans (NS), and dummy scans (DS) to obtain acceptable signal sensitivity with command “gs”, which enables go and scan to monitor data quality in real time.\nRecord the spectra using Zero Go “zg”.\nNMR Data Processing\nSet the processing parameters to the size of the direct F2 (1H) and indirect F1 (15N) dimensions of the spectrum using “SI F2=2048, F1=512” with optional linear prediction in indirect dimension (Figure 3).\nSelect “QSINE” as the Window function and enter a Sine bell shift (SSB) of 2 to process the two-dimensional spectrum.\nEnter the command “xfb” to process the data in both directions with window function and fourier transformation.\nUse the command “apk2d” to carry out automatic phase correction in both directions. If the automatic process does not achieve a satisfactory level of phase correction, extract FIDs with the “rser” command, calculate phase values from 1D processing, and apply them to the 2D data.",
    "Correct the baseline with the automatic baseline correction function “abs2” for 2D data. This applies a polynomial function between the ppm values defined in the processing parameters and will produce a 2D spectrum for further analysis.\nIf planning to perform serial processing for comparison of interaction data with another molecule, store the processing parameters with the command “wpar” and recall them with “rpar”. In this way all the datasets will be processed with same parameters and variations will not be introduced due to processing differences.\nNMR Data Analysis\nEnter the command “pp” to begin the process of peak picking.\nDefine the ppm range and minimum intensity/maximum number of peaks based on expected peaks (Figure 4). Click on OK and verify the results by visual inspection. If needed, re-run the process until results are satisfactory based on spectra quality.\nGenerate a peaklist with the “pp” command.\n\t\tNOTE: This peaklist contains data height/peak intensity information by default and can be exported to subsequent spectrums and can be read by other programs.\nObserve changes in the peak intensities or movement in chemical shifts in the protein HSQC spectra that indicate interaction with another molecule. If the interacting molecule is large, expect reductions in peak intensities along with disappearance of some peaks.\nImport the peak list to the next data set by clicking on the “peaks” tab and selecting “import” with a right click in the peaks window.\nVisualize the peaks over the spectrum and if needed shift them to new positions. Click on “reset intensities” for “complete table” to generate a peaklist for the spectrum with intensities (Figure 5). This peak list will carry over the position information from stored peak list.\nExport the peak lists from different datasets to a spreadsheet or other mathematical program for analysis by selecting the “Export” function.",
    "Calculate the change in peak intensities with the function “peak intensity in complex spectrum/peak intensity in protein spectrum” for each peak. Values can be converted to percentage change by multiplication of 100. Note that peak volumes are also useful although peak intensities are easier to measure for peaks that are positioned close to each other, as is usually the case for proteins with a high density of relatively broad peaks.\n4. MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST)\nPreparation of the Ligand Protein E-PRD\nExchange the ligand into an MST compatible buffer by dialyzing up to 800 μL of protein in a 3.5 kDa mini-dialysis unit suspended in 1 L of 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, stirring slowly at 4 °C overnight.\nConcentrate the ligand using a centrifugal ultrafiltration unit (3 kDa MWCO) by centrifuging at 14 000 x g for 10 min. Transfer the concentrated protein to a clean tube.\nCentrifuge the ligand at 21,000 x g for 10 min and carefully transfer the supernatant to a new tube to remove any precipitated protein. Determine the concentration of the ligand using the absorbance at 280 nm and the ligand extinction coefficient. Add 10% Tween-20 to give a final concentration of 0.015%. Tween-20 is added to the assay buffer to prevent adsorption to the capillaries. The final assay buffer that is used for the MST experiments is 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, 0.015% Tween-20.\nPreparation of Dye-labeled Target Protein VimRod\nReconstitute the RED-tris-NTA dye by adding 50 μL of 1x PBS-T supplied with the RED-tris-NTA to give a concentration of 5 μM. Dispense 2 μL aliquots into 200 μL tubes and store at -20 °C.",
    "Dilute the target protein to 0.34 μM with assay buffer. Add 58 μL of target to a 2 μL aliquot of RED-tris-NTA dye and incubate for 30 min at room temperature. The final concentration of dye-labeled target is 0.33 μM. Centrifuge the labeled target at 21,000 x g for 10 min and carefully transfer the supernatant to a new tube to remove any precipitate. The RED-tris-NTA dye binds to proteins through the His6 tag and has a binding dissociation constant (KD) in the sub-nanomolar range. It is effectively 100% bound to the target protein so no further purification is required.\nTurn on the MST instrument and open the Control Software. Select the Red setting for the RED-tris-NTA dye. Turn on the temperature control to 25 °C.\nSelect the Pretest to validate the labeling of the target and check for aggregation or adsorption to the cuvettes. An assessment of these parameters is automatically provided.\nMix 17 μL of assay buffer and 3 μL of target protein and mix by pipetting. Fill two standard capillaries by dipping them in the diluted target and drawing up liquid into the center of the capillary. Place capillaries in the tray and into the instruments. Start the measurement.\nReview the results looking for a sufficient level of fluorescence and no signs of adsorption (distortion in the capillary line shape) or aggregation (distortions in the MST trace) which will be flagged in the software analysis. If results are positive move on to the ligand steps, if not a different buffer must be tried or the amount of Tween-20 may be increased to 0.05% or higher.\nPreparation of the E-PRD Ligand Two-fold Dilution Series\nPrepare a dilution series by labeling 16, 200 μL tubes from 1-16.",
    "Add 17 μL of the ligand at 1.17x greater concentration than the maximum ligand concentration desired to Tube1. This volume is twice the amount needed (8.5 μL) as an aliquot will then be transferred to the next tube in series. The final volume of the assay is 10 μL so 8.5 μL of 1.17x concentration of ligand will be diluted to 1x by addition of 1.5 μL of the target protein, VimRod. This maximum concentration chosen should be at least 20 times the estimated KD value.\nAdd the 8.5 μL of assay buffer to Tubes2-16 using a new pipette tip for each aliquot. Reusing pipette tips can affect the accuracy (for advice on accurate pipetting see manufacturer’s instructions). Transfer 8.5 μL of ligand from Tube1 to Tube2 slowly releasing the solution into the assay buffer without generating bubbles. Mix the ligand and buffer by pipetting up and down at least 6 times, again without generating bubbles. The E-PRD in the most concentrated tube was 1.5 mM and the labeled VimRod was present at a final concentration of 50 nM.\nTransfer 8.5 μL of ligand from Tube2 to Tube3 and mix with the assay buffer. Repeat the serial dilution until all tubes have had ligand added. Discard 8.5 μL from Tube16 so that all tubes contain 8.5 μL of ligand in a series of two-fold dilutions.\nPreparation of the Binding Reaction and MST experiment\nAdd 1.5 μL of the labeled target protein to each of the tubes and mix gently by pipetting up and down being careful to avoid bubbles. Incubate for 15 min.",
    "Select the Expert Mode for the binding assay and enter in the parameters for a serial dilution series. Make sure temperature control is set to 25 °C, the excitation power is set to 40%, and the MST power to medium. These parameters must be optimized for other binding partners being studied.\nFill the capillaries with the binding reactions and place in the capillary tray. Load the tray into the instrument, wait for the temperature to regain 25 °C and start the measurement.\nData Analysis\nOpen the binding assay file in the Affinity analysis software. Review the capillary scans; Fluorescence levels should not vary more than 10% from the average, no aggregation or adsorption should be detected as described in section 3.6.\nSelect the MST analysis on the right panel and drag the assay data into the analysis set. If there are multiple runs of the same target-ligand binding assay under identical conditions they can be merged by dropping in the same set. Alternatively, each run can be dropped into analysis independently.\nMove to the Dose Response Fit tab to graph the data. Choose the KD model if a single binding site is expected. The Hill model is also an option for multiple binding sites with cooperative behavior. Outlier points that did not pass quality control can be removed from the fit at this stage. Merge sets with multiple assays will be averaged and errors calculated as the standard deviation.\nOpen the final tab and compare results between all plots on a single graph. Retrieve fitting results for each curve from the table that is generated. Export the data or fitted curves to other presentation or analysis software if desired."
