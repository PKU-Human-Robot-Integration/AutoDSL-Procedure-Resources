    "Isolation of intact chloroplastsSampling 0.5-1 g of seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana. Whole seedlings for one-week-old plants or shoots for eleven-day-old plants were used. Add 6 ml of grinding buffer and homogenize with homogenizer 3-5 times for 3 sec on ice. Filtrate the homogenate through 2 layers of gauze and a layer of Miracloth (put gauzes on the Miracloth). Centrifuge at 2,500 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant and gently resuspend the pellet in 1.5 ml of grinding buffer with a paintbrush. Brush the pellet gently with paintbrush little by little to avoid breaking of intact chloroplasts. Note that pipetting the pellet breaks chloroplasts. Add 1.5 ml of grinding buffer and 1 ml of 80% Percoll and gently mix. (Final concentration of Percoll is 20%.)Prepare Percoll step gradients. Layering first 3 ml of 80% Percoll and then 5 ml of 40% Percoll in 15 ml centrifuge tubes. Put the tip of pipette on the surface and slowly lay 40% Percoll to avoid disturbance of the gradient. See Figure 1. Lay 4 ml of crude chloroplast suspension (the results of step A5) on the top of Percoll gradients.Centrifuge at 3,200 x g for 30 min at 4 °C using a swing rotor. Set speed of acceleration and deceleration at minimum. Collect a green band with a Pasteur pipette corresponding to intact chloroplasts at the interface between 40% and 80% to 2 ml tubes. Remove carefully the upper band (broken chloroplasts) and transfer lower band to 2 ml tubes with a Pasteur pipette. See Figure 1. Add grinding buffer up to 2 ml and centrifuge at 700 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.",
    "Discard the supernatant and wash the pellet two times by resuspension in 1 ml of grinding solution and centrifugation at 700 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Suspend the pellet (intact chloroplasts) in 0.3 ml of grinding buffer. Take a part of the samples for measurement of protein concentration (step B9).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160205/20160205072033_7257.jpgFigure 1.

The tube after centrifugation; 5. Remove the upper band (broken chloroplasts); 6. Collect the lower band (intact chloroplasts).Extraction of PI4PAdd 750 μl of ice cold 0.75 M TCA to 250 μl of intact chloroplast samples. Vortex and incubate on ice for 5 min. Centrifuge at 700 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatant. Add 1 ml of 5% TCA with 1 mM EDTA to the pellet and vortex for 30 sec. Centrifuge at 700 x g for 5 min at room temperature and discard the supernatant. Add 1 ml of methanol:chloroform (2:1) to the pellet for extraction of neutral lipids and vortex 3 times for 30 sec at an interval of 5 min at room temperature. Centrifuge at 700 x g for 5 min at room temperature and discard the supernatant. Add 1 ml of methanol:chloroform (2:1) to the pellet for extraction of neutral lipids again and vortex for 1 min at room temperature. Centrifuge at 700 x g for 5 min at room temperature and discard the supernatant. Add 750 μl of methanol:chloroform:12 N HCl (80:40:1) to the pellet for extraction of acidic lipids and vortex 4 times for 30 sec at an interval of 5 min. Add 250 μl of chloroform and 450 μl of 0.",
    "1 M HCl and vortex. Centrifuge at 700 x g for 5 min, collect the lower phase and transfer it to new tubes.Dry samples in a vacuum dryer. Measure protein concentration. Add 1-10 μl of samples (step A13) into 1 ml of Bradford assay reagents (1:5 dilution). Incubate for 5 min at room temperature and measure absorbance at 595 nm. Measure absorbance of standard protein samples too. Make a standard curve using standard protein samples and calculate the PI4P concentration according to the reads. The concentration of protein is usually 0.3-0.8 mg/ml.Measurement of PI4P levelsAdd 15 μl of chloroform: methanol: water (1:2:0.8, v/v/v) to the sample. Vortex for 30 sec and sonicate (100% output) in icy water bath for 5 min. Vortex again for 30 sec. Centrifuge 15,000 x g for 5 min and transfer 10 μl of supernatant to new tube. Do not suck the pellet at the bottom of tube. Spot samples onto a PI(4)P Strip. Spot 1 μl of sample at a time. Before spotting sample again in the same area, dry the spot. After all samples are spotted, dry the strip for 30 min at room temperature. See Figure 2.Incubate the membrane with blocking solution (3% fatty acid-free BSA in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. Incubate the membrane with 5 ml of blocking solution containing 1 vial of PI(4)P Detector (2.5 μg protein) for 1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. Discard the solution and wash the membrane with 10 ml of PBST three times at room temperature with gentle agitation for 5 min each. Incubate the washed membrane with 5 ml of blocking solution containing 75 μl of secondary detector for 1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation.",
    "Discard the solution and wash the membrane three times with 10 ml of PBST at room temperature with gentle agitation for 5 min each. Incubate the washed membrane with enough ECL solution to cover the membrane at room temperature for 5 min.Wash the membrane with water three times to stop the reaction and dry the membrane.Scan the membrane to record the obtained data. See Figure 2."
