    "The experimental protocol was approved by the Animal Experimentation Committee at Kyoto University. The study utilized C57BL/6 mice, aged over 10 weeks and weighing between 25 g and 30 g, obtained from a commercial source (see Table of Materials). All animals were anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane (following institutionally approved protocols), maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions, and all experimental procedures were conducted in compliance with Kyoto University's Regulations on Animal Experimentation. The appropriate instruments used for the study are listed in the Table of Materials and depicted in Figure 1 and Figure 2.\n1. Animal selection\nUse mice with a body weight of 25-30 g.\n\tâ€‹NOTE: While mouse liver allografts2 are generally accepted across major histocompatibility complex barrier, we opted for the syngeneic MOLT model in this study to focus on the detailed mechanism of cold ischemia reperfusion injury10. Mice weighing less than 25 g are not recommended because it is impossible to insert an inner stent into a thin bile duct. Similarly, mice weighing more than 30 g are not recommended due to the presence of a large amount of intraabdominal fat around the vessels.\n2. Cuff making\nPrepare 20 G and 16 G intravenous catheters for the PV and IHIVC, respectively.\nUsing a scalpel, cut the catheter to create the cuff. The main body of the cuff should measure 2 mm in length, with an extension handle of 1 mm (Figure 3A).\n\tNOTE: If the handle is too large, it may become challenging to insert the cuff.\nOn the cuff's surface, create a shallow groove for thread fixation using the back of the scalpel blade.",
    "NOTE: When applying the back of the scalpel blade to the cuff, ensure that the tip of the blade is at an angle of approximately 60 degrees (as shown in Figure 3B). After making the first groove, secure the scalpel blade and rotate the cuff. Ideally, two grooves are recommended, but a single groove can suffice without issues.\n3. Cuff attachment\nIn a plastic rectangular-shaped container, place small ice cubes and position a small metal cup (6 cm in diameter) on top. Fill the cup with organ preservation fluid (see Table of Materials) and place the syngeneic graft within.\nGently roll the syngeneic liver graft (extracted from another donor mouse) using a cotton swab, ensuring that the porta hepatis faces upwards. Thoroughly remove any blood stored in the lumen of the IVC with organ preservation fluid.\nThread the PV through the cuff using a thread attached, for example, to the splenic vein (see Figure 4A).\nWith the cuff handle at the 12 o'clock position, secure both the handle and cuff with a bulldog clamp (see Table of Materials), positioning it 2 to 3 mm from the PV edge.\nSecure the bulldog clamp further using large vascular forceps and a fixation mold to establish the operative field (see Figure 4B).\nCarefully inspect the PV lumen at approximately 15 to 20x magnification. If necessary, dripping water can enhance visibility of the lumen.\nGently grasp the PV lumen and externalize it through the cuff.\nOnce fully externalized, secure it with a double ligation using 8-0 silk thread along the cuff's groove (Figure 4C,D).\n\tNOTE: Ensure that the ligature is not loose. Also, take care that the ligature point is not too large, as it may interfere with cuff insertion. The ligature point can be positioned in any direction.",
    "Attach the cuff to the IHIVC using a procedure similar to that used for the PV (Figure 4E).\n\tNOTE: When clamping the IHIVC with the cuff, avoid biting into the liver parenchyma. Since the neck is shorter than the PV, carefully determine the clamping position.\nCreate a slipknot by passing the thread around the base of the IHIVC to temporarily ligate the IHIVC (Figure 5). This thread will be removed after reperfusion.\n4. Portal vein reconstruction\nAnesthetize the recipient mouse following institutionally approved protocols and extract the native liver as described in published literature2.\nEnsure that the hepatic lobe is properly positioned and that the cuffed PV is free from kinking and torsion.\nGently grasp the recipient's PV edge using Pean forceps and secure it with a vise.\nApply a vascular clamp to the recipient's PV and pass an 8-0 silk thread around it.\nCreate a 1/4 circumferential section approximately 0.5 mm from the PV edge (Figure 6A). Enlarge the hole while passing saline solution through the lumen using a specialized instrument (a 27 G needle with the tip cut off and bent into an L-shape).\nUse straight forceps to grip the cuff handle and insert it into the lumen.\nOnce fully inserted, secure the cuff with an 8-0 silk thread. A single ligation is sufficient for fixation.\nRemove the vascular clamp and reperfuse the liver.\nCarefully release the Pean forceps and complete the portal vein reconstruction. The entire PV reconstruction process should take approximately 5 min.\n5. Infrahepatic inferior vena cava reconstruction\nPosition the liver lobe appropriately and move the Pean forceps attached to the recipient IHIVC dorsal to the graft's right lower lobe, securing it with a vise.\nEliminate any remaining liver tissue around the recipient's IVIHC by gently rubbing with a cotton swab.",
    "Pass an 8-0 silk thread around the recipient's IVIHC.\nCreate a 1/4 circumferential section at approximately 0.5 mm from the recipient's IVIHC edge (Figure 6B).\nAfter introducing normal saline solution into the lumen, insert the cuff into the lumen.\n\tNOTE: Due to the short neck, the cuff is often inserted more shallowly than in the PV.\nCarefully secure the cuff with an 8-0 silk thread and then remove the vascular clamp and Pean forceps.\n6. Postoperative care\nUtilize a heating pad and warming lamp to facilitate postoperative recovery.\nContinuously monitor blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, body temperature, as well as food and water consumption.\nRoutinely administer analgesics and antibiotics following institutional guidelines to alleviate postoperative pain.\nSubscription Required.
