  "procedures": [
    "The study was approved by the ethics committee of the SWPS University of Social Science and Humanities in Warsaw (number 46/2016).\n1. Choosing an experimental site for logger deployment\nChoose an indoor experimental site that will allow mounting the logger in close proximity to the light source (for adequate light changes detection) as well as to gather the data on the behavior regarding the room occupancy status (for adequate movement detection) of individual participants (i.e., one at a time).\nEstablish the intended use of the room and its designated users (males, females or co-ed).\n\tNOTE: An example of an experimental site could be a public single-stall restroom due to the fact that this type of room is frequently and individually visited by its users. Furthermore, in most instances, it is possible to specify if the room is visited by males or females, based on its designation.\nVisit a chosen site and note the type / number of functioning light sources along with their light switches. Check whether multiple light sources are controlled by one or multiple light switches.\nCheck the possibilities of mounting the logger next to the light source. Ensure that the place of logger mounting is not in proximity to any kind of heating sources (e.g., heaters, windows or mirrors) to ensure that only the body heat of the room users will be recorded.\nAcquire any necessary written permissions from the site owner for installation of the logger and conducting the experiment. Provide the site owner with the details of the experiment, loggers' type and its application in written form.\n2. Logger configuration before deployment\nDownload and install the dedicated software (see Table of Materials) available for Windows/Mac platforms for launching, reading out, and plotting data from data loggers.",
    "NOTE: Additionally a detailed description with basic system requirements and the software manual can be found on the manufacturer's website (see Table of Materials).\nConnect the logger via USB cable to the computer (plug the larger end of the USB interface cable into a USB port on the computer and the smaller end of the USB interface cable into the port on the device).\nLaunch the software.\nClick the Launch icon on the toolbar (or select Launch command from the device menu) which opens loggers' setup window.\n\tNOTE: This option will be unavailable when the logger is not connected to the computer. The Launch Logger window is divided into the following three sections: 1) logger Information which presents model, serial number, deployment number, and current battery level of the selected logger; 2) list of the sensors available for the logger; and 3) deployment configuration. From this interface, one can set specific features that will configure the logger before deployment, such as those previously mentioned: sensor configuration, configuration of data display filters, start/stop logging, and display of the LCD screen.\nEnter a name for the launch which will be used as the default file name during read out and saving the data recorded by the logger.\nSelect the Light sensor. Set the measurement to log State from the drop-down list, and choose the state description off/on from the drop-down list.\nSelect the Occupancy sensor. Set the measurement to log State from the drop-down list, and choose the state description unoccupied/occupied from the drop-down list.",
    "NOTE: Occupancy and light sensor channels can be configured to log state changes or runtime. On the state change setting, the work of the logger is event-dependent. While checking every second for a state change, the logger will only record a time-stamped value (how long an event lasts, date and time) when the state change occurs. On the other hand, on the runtime configuration setting, the logger checks and records the state of the sensor status once every second.\nClick the Filters button to enable automatic calculation of additional values (e.g., maximum, minimum, average, or total).\n\tNOTE: Step 2.8 is optional and serves for filtering data for each series during loggers' readout.\n\t\nSelect the sensor type of choice. Select the type of filter and the interval to use.\nEdit the Name and click Create New Series. Click Done.\nClick the Advanced button to access the sensor properties.\n\t\nSelect the Light sensor. Select Set to maximum sensitivity for calibration and click the Save button.\n\t\tNOTE: By default, the light sensor can be auto-calibrated at the location where the logger will be deployed using the control button located on the top panel. By simply pressing the calibration button, while on the site of deployment, the loggers' LCD screen will display the signal strength of the light being monitored (use this option when light levels in the experimental site are unknown prior to deployment). The sensors' sensitivity can also be adjusted via option \"Set to Maximum/Minimum Sensitivity\" - if the light levels in the place of deployment are known in advance. These forms of calibration ensure an accurate readout of light changes between ON and OFF states.",
    "Select the Occupancy sensor. Select a preset timeout value (i.e., 10 s; 30 s; 1 min; 2 min; 5 min) or select Custom and enter a value in minutes and seconds if needed. Click the Save button.\n\t\tNOTE: The timeout value specifies the period of inactivity required for the sensor to consider the area unoccupied. By default, this attribute is set to 1 min.\nSelect when to launch the logger, depending on the experimental plan: 1) immediately; 2) at intervals (available when logging runtime); 3) on a specified date/time; or 4) by manually using the start button.\nSelect when logger should stop logging: 1) when memory fills; 2) stop at a specified date/time; 3) stop manually or 4) never stopâ€”resulting in the newest data overwriting the oldest.\nClick the Start button upon finishing the configuration. Unplug the logger from the computer.\n3. Deploying the logger in the field settings\nVisit the experimental site before the time the logger will start recording the data.\nEquip the logger with an additional fiber optic light pipe (see Table of Materials) by connecting it to the back of the logger, in order to filter out any ambient light (coming from windows or mirror reflections) and ensure the most accurate readings.\n\tNOTE: The light pipe is 30.48 cm long and can be bent to gain access to hard-to-reach areas, which can be also useful in hiding the logger from the sight of any room user.",
    "Mount the logger with the light pipe next to the designated light source with the use of: 1) four built-in magnets on the back of the logger that can attach it to a magnetic surface; 2) adhesive strip that can be attached to the back of the logger to mount it on walls or other flat surfaces; 3) any double-sided tape to stick the logger to a surface; or 4) the hook-and-loop strap which can be used through the mounting loops on both sides of the logger to mount it to a curved surface.\n\tNOTE: The choice of the mounting method depends on the type of surface to which the logger will be mounted.\nLeave the experimental site for the time of data logging set or planned.\nAfter finishing recording, revisit the experimental site and remove the logger for the purpose of data readout.\n4. Data readout\nConnect the logger via USB cable to the computer and launch the analysis software package dedicated to the data logger (see Table of Materials).\nClick the Readout device button from the control panel or select Readout from the device menu, which will enable the logger to unload the gathered data.\nChoose a location and a filename or accept the default location and name to save the data. Click Save and select the sensors and/or events to display in a graph and click Plot.\nSelect the series to view on the table data and plot. Click the All or None button to select or deselect all series, or click the checkboxes to select or deselect individual series.",
    "NOTE: The table data is presented numerically using added filters that were set before the deployment. Each column corresponds to the type of data gathered. For example, the column labeled \"light\" presents the occurrences of light-switching, whereas the column labeled \"occupancy\" presents the information about the presence of movement in the field where the logger was deployed. In each column, the state changes are presented dichotomously (the number \"0\" represents the light status of off in the \"light\" column and a lack of movement in the \"occupancy\" column).\nSelect Export table data from the control panel. Choose destination folder for the export.\n\tNOTE: It is possible to perform a data readout and export it to text, comma-separated values, or spreadsheet files. Other options, such as data plotting, are also available; however, due to the fact that most researchers work on exported data and use statistical packages, we decided to present the most basic data readout.
