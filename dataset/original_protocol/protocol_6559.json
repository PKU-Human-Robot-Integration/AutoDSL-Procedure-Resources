    "Representation of SMART assayFigure 1 shows a representative scheme of the SMART assay.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200729/20200729004015_9106.pngFigure 1. Schematics of SMART assay. First of all, label HeLa cells with IdU for 24 h followed by CPT treatment; at the end of incubation trypsinize cells and dilute them at a 2.5 x 105 cells/ml concentration. Mix labelled and unlabelled cells 1:8 and spot 2.5 μl of this mix onto the upper part of the slide; after incubation with 7.5 μl of spreading buffer, tilt the slide form the end to allow the stretching of the DNA fibres.Figure 2 shows representative images acquired through confocal microscopy.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200729/20200729004032_5509.pngFigure 2. Representative images of the SMART technique. Panel A shows two images from HeLawt or siEXOI cells treated with 1 μM of campthotecin for one hour; following the SMART assay images were analyzed as reported in the protocol through the Fiji software. As shown in panel B the silencing of EXOI, one of the principal exonucleases involved in the generation of single strand DNA upon DNA damage, reduces the length of the processed DNA up to two times. The Figure 3B reports the mean ± standard deviation of the fibre length measured in μm, for each condition.SMART assay protocolCulture HeLa cells in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 μg/ml penicillin and 1 µg/ml streptomycin.Treat HeLa cells in a 6 cm dish at 80% confluency with 10 μM of IdU (we made a 28 mM IdU stock solution in 0.2 N NaOH) and incubate at 37 °C in a standard 5% CO2 incubator for 24 h.Note: The length of incubation with BrdU or its analogs such as IdU has to be determined for each different cell type, depending on the cell cycle length. A pulse labelling time needs to allow BrdU incorporation during one complete cell cycle.",
    "Prepare a 6 cm dish of HeLa cells at 80% confluence as non-IdU-marked.Note: The dilution of IdU marked cell with the non-marked cells is essential to reduce the presence of marked fibres onto the glass slides favouring a correct immunofluorescence analysis. Treat HeLa cells with 1 μM of camptothecin in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 μg/ml penicillin and 1 µg/ml streptomycin and incubate at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 2 h.Note: The incubation time and drug concentration for the DNA damage agent can change in different cell types. As control, perform a DNA damage response analysis with different conditions evaluating DNA damage and resection through Western blot using an anti phospho-RPA32 S4/8 antibody (Bethyl Laboratories). Detach HeLa cells from the dish with 1 ml of Trypsin-EDTA solution for 5 min at 37 °C in a standard 5% CO2 incubator.Inactivate the trypsin-EDTA solution with 3 ml of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 μg/ml penicillin and 1 µg/ml streptomycin.Centrifuge HeLa cells for 5 min at 800 x g (rcf).Wash the cell pellet with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 800 x g (rcf). Repeat Step B8 twice.Resuspend HeLa labelled cells with the ice-cold PBS at 2.5 x 105 cells/ml. Prepare another mix of unlabelled cells at the same concentration (2.5 x 105 cells/ml).Dilute labelled cells by mixing them in a 1:8 proportion with unlabelled cells.Mix 2.5 μl of cells with 7.5 μl of spreading buffer directly on the upper part of the slides.Incubate at room temperature (RT) for 10 min.Tilt the slide, from the ends, to 15°.DNA spreads are air-dried, approximately 10 min.Fix DNA fibres in 3:1 methanol/acetic acid at -20 °C for 15 min.Wash slides in PBS twice.",
    "Note: The volume of PBS depends on the container used for the immersion of the slides Incubate DNA fibres in 70% ethanol and 30% water overnight at 4 °C.Wash slides with PBS twice.Note: This step is essential to remove all the ethanol residues before blocking DNA fibres. The volume of PBS depends on the container used for the immersion of the slides. Block DNA fibres with PBS + 5% BSA for 30 min at RT.Note: The volume of PBS depends on the container used for the immersion of the slides Incubate slides with 1:300 Anti-BrdU clone BU1/75 (ICR1) for one hour at 37 °C.Wash slides with PBS twice.Note: The volume of PBS depends on the container used for the immersion of the slides. Incubate slides with 1:400 Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated chicken anti-rat.Wash slides with PBS twice.Note: The volume of PBS depends on the container used for the immersion of the slides. Mount the slide with ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent.Analyse the slide through a confocal microscope (we used the Zeiss LSM100) with a minimum of 63x oil immersion objective."
