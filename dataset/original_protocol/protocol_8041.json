    "All animal experiments were approved by the Norwegian Food Safety Authority experimental animal administration’s supervisory and application system (FOTS-18/106800-1).\n1. Zebrafish husbandry\nSet up matings of wild type adult male and female zebrafish (Danio rerio) stocks, maintained under standard conditions25 the evening before. Here, Tupfel long-fin (TL) strain is used.\nRemove barriers the next morning and allow to mate through natural spawning.\nCollect eggs out of the mating tanks.\nRemove unfertilized eggs and other debris, then transfer eggs to petri dishes (n = 60) and raise in an incubator at 28 °C in embryo medium: 1.5 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 17.4 mM NaCl, 0.21 mM KCl, 0.12 mM MgSO4, and 0.18 mM Ca(NO3)2.\nRenew half of the embryo medium and remove dead larvae daily until 6 dpf.\n\tNOTE: All experiments were performed on individual larvae at 6 days post-fertilization (dpf).\n2. Pharmacological agents and pre-treatment of larvae\nDissolve apomorphine and ketamine in E3 medium to make 500 µM and 10 mM stock solutions respectively.\nDissolve haloperidol in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to make a 10 mM stock solution. The final concentration of DMSO used was 0.1%.\nUse 0.1% DMSO and E3 medium as vehicle controls.\nUse the following final concentrations of drugs: 10 mg/mL of apomorphine, 1 mM ketamine and 20 µM haloperidol16.\nPre-expose the apomorphine and ketamine groups larvae for 10 min and the haloperidol and DMSO vehicle control groups for 20 min16.\n3. Setup prior to the behavior test\nOn the day of the experiment, transfer larvae and all relevant materials into the experiment room. Set the experiment room to a temperature of 27 ± 1 °C.\nEnsure that the background noise in the test chamber is as low as possible, preferably not more than 45 dB sound pressure level (SPL).",
    "Install the sonometer microphone of the decibel (dB) meter in the test chamber (the opening for installation is already bored by the manufacturer).\nTo reduce the background noise in the room, insulate the test chamber with a custom-built sound booth (see Figure 1B for an overview of the set-up).\nPrepare a 96-well plate for the prepulse inhibition test.\n\tNOTE: The video camera has a 2048 × 500 pixel resolution, meaning only a maximum of 3 lanes (33 wells) can be imaged at a time.\n\t\nUse a custom-made acrylic plate of 96-well format to reduce interference from shadows.\n\t\tNOTE: The measurements for the custom plate can be found at the following website: https://zenodo.org/record/3739378#.XooyLW5uKas\nWith the aid of a transfer pipette, transfer 310 µL of exposure solution/medium with one larva into each well.\nCalibrate and measure the stimulus intensity using the volume knob of the stereo amplifier and a decibel meter respectively.\nRegister the maximum sound intensity in the “level reference” section.\n4. Stimulus parameters and video acquisition\nTurn on the computer, the amplifier system and the dB meter (see Figure 1A for an overview of set-up).\nUse the volume knob by turning it to minimum or maximum to adjust the sound intensity.\n\t\nCheck the sound level with the dB meter each time, the volume knob is adjusted. This is important in finding the maximum and minimum sound intensity that can be produced by the set-up.\n\t\tNOTE: The dB meter computes the RMS dB output for the stimulus. The system generates the sound inside the solid components of the test-chamber, keeping the plate firm while producing a vibration in the horizontal plane of the entire plate support.\n\t\t\nAdjust the volume knob to maximum, measure the sound intensity with the dB meter and use this value.",
    "On the interface of the PPI generator, define the parameters: inter-stimulus interval represented as Delay; inter-trial interval represented as Acquisition delta time; duration of prepulse etc.\n\t\nFor prepulse alone trials, ensure that the “Amplitude” or Duration of stimulus for Startle parameters are set to zero and vice versa for startle alone trials.\nTo generate a trial list, select Add > give a name to the trial. For example, “Prepulse 50 dB alone”.\n\tNOTE: One can generate as many trials as desired, but be careful of how long the list is since this can crash the program.\n\t\nInterleave prepulse trials with pulse alone trials in all PPI experiments using a pseudorandom order. Where multiple stimuli are presented in an experiment, an inter-trial interval (ITI) of 30 s is used.\n\t\tNOTE: In this study, a 100 ms startle stimulus (pulse) of 660 Hz, and 5 ms prepulse stimuli of 440 Hz were used. For PPI experiments, inter-stimulus interval (ISI) was 100 ms.\nTo save the protocol, select File > Save as.\nAdjust lighting conditions in the test-chamber as follows.\n\t\nLaunch USB measurement computing, select analog out then go to D/A OUT O (P13) to make changes to the lighting. A value of zero means no light while increasing the D/A OUT O value, increases the intensity of light in the box. Light intensity of 100 was used for all experiments.\nSet-up the camera\n\t\nLaunch the software and wait for the camera to load.\nSelect Adjustments (found on right-hand side) and set the acquisition frame rate to 1,000 then click apply to effect the change.\nAcclimate larvae to a 100% light illuminated test chamber for 5 min before the experiments are started.",
    "To begin an experiment, select the Experiment menu on the PPI generator, click Run and the select well format (e.g., 33 wells).\n\t\nAlways make sure that the camera software is launched with the right settings before running an experiment.\nAcquire a 2 s video for each trial.\nMake sure that the acquisition frame rate is set at 1,000.\n5. Automated tracking and analysis of acoustic startle response and PPI\nProtocol setup.\n\t\nLaunch the analysis software (see the Table of Materials). Choose New from template > Apply a predefined template and then go through other menus (details below).\n\t\t\nChoose from video file under Video Source.\nBrowse video file. Set subject as fish > zebrafish larvae > zone template (no template). Specify Number of arenas under Arenas.\nSpecify Number of subjects per arena (set as 1) under Subjects.\nSelect Center-point, nose-point and tail-base detection under Tracked Features (see Figure 2A,B).\n\t\t\tNOTE: This is important to calculate the body angle of the C-start response (see Figure 2C).\nClick Name > save as. Units used are mm, s, deg for distance, time and rotation respectively.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Remember to use the same unit for calibrating the scale.\nChoose Arena setting.\n\t\t\nClick Grab background image.\nGo through the steps on the right-hand menu (if in doubt, use the Help menu).\nChoose the circle drawing tool to draw the arenas.\nChoose Trial control settings > create new > name.\nChoose Detection settings, go through the steps on the right-hand menu.\n\t\t\nSet sample rate to 25. Choose advanced detection settings. Under Method, select dynamic subtraction, advanced model/adult fish, then set Subject color compared to background as Darker and move the slider to define the larva’s contrast.\nUnder subject contour, select erode first, then dilate and increase the contour erosion and dilation values until the animal is completely detected.",
    "Save the protocol and use for subsequent analyses of PPI videos acquired.\nTrial list setup.\n\t\nChoose trial list, define independent variables such as larval ID, treatment, stimulus type, etc. Select the path of videos and define a list of trials for batch acquisition.\nAcquisition setup.\n\tNOTE: If a trial list has been generated, one can perform a batch acquisition of the videos.\n\t\nIf some tracks are lost, use the track editor to adjust the tracked features.\nExclude from analysis, the tracking errors that remain unresolved after using the track editor.\nSet track smoothing profile to 1 mm to decrease noise from data. This can be adjusted based on the background activity of larvae.\nAnalysis setup.\n\t\nTo select trials to be analyzed, choose Data profiles and define tracks based on the independent variable of interest.\n\t\tNOTE: If components are hidden, click on the eye symbol to the upper right-hand corner to display.\n\t\t\nFilter parts of trials to be analyzed (e.g., based on treatment or type of stimulus group).\nSelect part of the tracks to be analyzed (nesting). For this study, data was nested for tracks between onset of stimulus and 100 ms after stimulus onset.\nRemember to connect all filters and nesting boxes with arrow lines to complete the instruction.\nDefine dependent variables to be analyzed, select Analysis profiles and specify the variables of interest (focus on Body under dependent variables).\n\t\tNOTE: If components are hidden, click on the eye symbol to the upper right-hand corner to display.\n\t\t\nDouble click Body angle. Select absolute bend. Go through Trial settings and select maximum, then click on add.",
    "Double click body angle state. Set averaging interval to 5 samples. Set bend angle threshold. To calculate statistics for bent, go through Trial statistics and select latency to first > add. Repeat steps until varying thresholds are obtained (between 20–80° was used) and name accordingly.\nGenerating statistics and charts.\n\t\t\nChoose analysis > results > statistics & charts, then click calculate.\nMake sure the data and analysis profiles are set to the right template since several templates can be made under each section.\nExport trial and group statistics as spreadsheet files for processing and analysis.\n6. Data analysis\nOpen the spreadsheet file containing the trial statistics.\nSelect the columns Body angle Maximum deg, Bent latency (of the various body angle thresholds).\nConsider every change in body angle ≥ 30° within a cut-off latency of 50 ms after stimulus onset as a positive C-start response (i.e., a responder); those with < 30° body angle are non-responders.\nIn a binary fashion, assign 1 to a responding larva and 0 to non-responding larvae for each plate.\n\t\nCount the total number of responders and non-responder larvae for each plate. Calculate the responders (%) in each case calculated as (number of larvae responding/total number of larvae) × 100. Exclude larvae that respond less than 30% to the startle stimulus from the analysis16.\n\t\tNOTE: Any stimulus intensity capable of eliciting a C-start response in equal to or more than 70% of the larvae is considered a suitable startle stimulus16.\nCalculate %PPI as 100 × (percentage responding to startle stimulus − percentage responding to prepulse + startle sequence)/ (percentage responding to startle stimulus)16.\n7. Statistical analysis\nPresent data as the mean ± standard deviation, S.D. (see the Table of Materials for statistical software).",
