    "All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the standards of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and approved by West Virginia University’s IACUC.\n1. Pre-handling\nSet Up the Pool\n\t\nProp the pre-handling pool so it is raised to a comfortable height.\nPlace 2 L of water (21 °C) in the pre-handling pool to a level of approximately 1 cm.\n\t\tNote: Do not add coloring.\nProcedure\n\t\nBring the mice from the vivarium to the testing room.\nVerify the subject identification (subject number, tail tattoo, ear clip, etc.).\nMark the mouse’s tail with a permanent marker to distinguish mice within the cage that have undergone pre-handling testing from those that remain to be tested. Mark all mice in one cage with the same color.\nPlace a mouse in the transfer beaker for approximately 5 sec. Then, gently pour the mouse out of the beaker into the pre-handling pool.\nUsing a timer, allow the mouse to remain in the pool for 20 sec.\nAfter 20 sec, gently place the scoop (without angling it) in front of the mouse. Briefly allow the mouse to explore the scoop, and if needed, encourage the mouse to get on the scoop by gently sliding the scoop under the mouse while slowly lifting. Take care not to frighten the mice with the scoop.\nOnce the mouse is in the scoop, transport it back to the holding cage.\nRepeat these procedures for each mouse in the cage once per day for 10 days. At regular intervals (e.g. after each animal), pick up fecal boli and bedding from the pool using a net.\nRinse the transfer beaker with water at regular intervals (e.g. following the completion of a cage of mice).",
    "Once these steps are completed, rinse the transfer beaker with water several times, dump out water from the pool, and rinse the pool approximately two times with water.\n2. Visible Platform Training\nSetup the Mouse Performance Tracking Software e.g. Viewer (See Table of Materials).\n\t\nCalibrate the video to match the dimensions of the maze under the 'Configuration' –“Filters and Objects” tab.\nSet filters so that the software can differentiate a mouse from the background.\n\t\t\nAdjust the “sensitivity” beneath the “Background filter” area so that the tracking software identifies the animal.\nClick the “accept” option once the tracking software identifies the animal. Choose the “edit” option to blackout areas outside the maze area.\nSelect the appropriate “animal filter” and “min. animal size”.\nCreating the Run Sheets\n\t\nCreate a run sheet listing each mouse, each potential location, and a space for notes containing information about aberrant behavior.\nPredetermine locations for the visible platform test that are the same for each group of mice. Thus, for the first trial, pre-determine that the platform will be placed on the side opposite to where the mouse is placed into the maze, on the right side close to the wall. For the second trial, pre-determine that the platform will be placed in a different location along the back wall for each mouse and that this will continue for each of the 6 trials.\nSet Up the Room\n\t\nHang curtains around the room so that any spatial cues are obscured.\nSet Up the Tub.",
    "Place the tub so it matches the configuration in the tracking software by ensuring the maze matches up with the configuration setup on the “Configuration” –“Zone Definition” tab. Note: It helps to ensure the tub is in the proper location prior to filling it with water as the tub is not easily relocated once filled.\nFill the tub with tap water, and using a thermometer, ensure the water temperature is approximately 21 °C. Ensure that the water remains within one degree of this temperature throughout testing, as colder water can impact performance especially when using aged mice 8.\n\t\tNote: Do not add coloring.\nUsing the predetermined locations, place the platform, which has a mounted flag that reaches a height of 13 cm and is 4.5 cm x 4.5 cm with a bold “S” shaped character embossed on it, in the first location of the tub so that it is approximately 1 inch above the surface of the water.\nProcedure\n\t\nTake the first mouse from the cage, verify the subject identification, mark the tail using a permanent marker of the correct color, and place in the beaker.\nGently place the mouse into the tub, start the timer, and ensure that the tracking software is tracking the animal. Allow the mouse up to 2 min to locate the platform. Once the mouse locates the platform, allow the mouse 20 sec on the platform.\nIf the animal finds the platform and proceeds to jump or fall off, scoop the mouse and place the mouse on the platform. If the mouse continues to jump or fall off the platform, hold the mouse on the platform, so the mouse learns that remaining on the platform leads to escape from the tub.",
    "Note: The mouse should remain on the platform for a combined time of 20 sec; thus, if the mouse jumps off after 5 sec, the amount of time left on the platform is 15 sec and does not reset to 20 sec.\nIf the animal fails to find the platform in the 2 min period, scoop the mouse and place it on the platform for 20 sec.\nFollowing 20 sec on the platform, remove the mouse from the platform as done in pre-handling training and place the mouse in the heated cage lined with paper towels and warmed to ~31 °C by a heating pad and heat lamp for 30 sec. Perform periodic assessment of body temperature with a rectal thermometer to ensure that certain strains of mice or mice at a certain age are not differentially susceptible to hypothermia induced by exposure to the water.\nAfter 2 min to the holding cage with the heating lamp, transfer the mouse to the holding cage with only a heating pad, but no heat lamp, to recover between trials. Eventually, place all mice from a single home cage into the same holding cage during testing.\nClean the maze of debris with a net after each mouse has completed a trial, to disrupt olfactory cues.\nRepeat these steps for each mouse in the group. After each mouse has completed the first trial, move the platform to the second predetermined location.\n\tNote: The platform will remain in the same location for each mouse during a single trial and will be moved to the other predetermined locations for the ensuing trials. This is done to ensure that mice 1) learn there is a platform to escape from, 2) swim directly to the visible platform, thus demonstrating intact visual competence, and 3) have no motor deficits.",
    "Perform these procedures for 6 trials for the first 3 days of testing. Thus, perform visible training on testing days 1, 2, and 3, with approximately 10 min between each trial (Figure 2).\nDuring visible platform training, use the animal tracking software to measure latency to reach the platform, track the pathlength of the animal, and swim speed. Obtain these measurements from the “Water maze” tab under “Experimental list” and export directly to an excel spreadsheet.\n\tNote: The use of a hand timer can also be beneficial to ensure the accuracy of the tracking software.\n3. Morris Water Maze Hidden Platform Training\nSet Up the Room\n\t\nHang up curtains in the room to obscure spatial cues in the laboratory.\nPlace cues strategically on the curtains. Ensure that the cues are large and contain contrasting colors (ex.: black and white) for better visibility. Hang cues at a distance and height where they are visible to mice from inside the tub. Note: The cues are static and do not move during the course of testing.\nSetup the Mouse Performance Tracking Software\n\t\nCalibrate the video to match the dimensions of the maze under the 'Configuration' –“Filters and Objects” tab.\nSet the filters so that the software can differentiate the mice from the background.\n\t\t\nUse the same procedures as described in the visible platform testing (steps 2.1.2.1-2.1.2.3) to set up the filters for Morris water maze hidden platform training.\nCreate four equal quadrants inside the maze\n\t\t\nClick the “Ellipse” option under the “Zone Definition” tab first, and create a circle that matches the maze on the screen. Note: On this tab, the actual maze set up is displayed, so it allows the option to match the computer setup with the actual maze setup.",
    "Click the “Rectangle” option and create four equal squares. Place these squares on the screen to create four equal quadrants within the newly created circle.\nCreate the platforms in the maze.\n\t\t\nSelect the “Ellipse” option, and create a circle the size of the platform that will be used. Note: Placing the platform in the maze beforehand can be beneficial to create an ellipse the exact size of the platform.\nPlace the newly created platform location in the center of the target quadrant. (it is recommended to name this object “target” to distinguish the correct platforms from the rest). Critical step: In the box just below “Grid”, select the “stop” option under “trigger” for the target platform. This will cause the program to stop once the mouse reaches the platform.\nCreate three other identical platform areas, and place them in the exact locations in the other quadrants. Do not select “stop” in the “trigger” option.\nCreating the Run Sheets\n\t\nCreate a run sheet listing each mouse, each trial, a space to write down the time to reach the platform, and a space to note aberrant behavior (Table 1).\nPre-determine the release point of each mouse in a pseudorandom manner. Use pseudo-random selection such that the distance to the platform is equal each day, each of the 4 locations is used equally, and the angle from the start to platform (i.e., from left or right) is balanced within and between days.\n\t\tNote: the location of the platform on the run sheet to ensure the location of the platform does not move from the original position. Ensure that the platform is in the center of one of the four zones that were created on the tracking software.",
    "Note: If longitudinal testing is being conducted at various ages, move the platform to a new location at each age.\nSet Up the Maze\n\t\nAdjust either the water maze or the camera such that there is a match between the maze and the configuration setup on the “Configuration” –“Zone Definition” tab.\nLabel the four unseen quadrants of the maze (N, S, E, W). Check that these match with the configuration in the tracking software to ensure mice are being released from the correct starting points.\n\t\tCritical Step: Place these labels outside of the maze and out of view of a swimming animal given that cues within the maze constitute a non-spatial, non-hippocampal dependent task.\nFill the maze with tap water (approximately 21 °C) so that the platform is approximately 5 mm below the surface of the water.\nPlace the platform in the predetermined location.\n\t\tNote: The location of the platform will remain the same for all mice being tested across all days and trials.\nUse non-toxic white tempera paint to make the water opaque. Do this to ensure that the top of the platform is invisible from the animals’ eye level while swimming.\nProcedure\n\t\nTake the mouse from the cage, mark the tail using a permanent marker of the correct color, and place in the beaker.\nGently pour the mouse into the maze, so that it enters facing the wall. Note: Each mouse will be placed in the same starting location for a unique trial.\nAt the initial release of the mouse, begin the timer and stand in an area where the tester is not easily visible by the mice. Ensure that animal tracking software is properly tracking the animal.\nOnce the animal reaches the platform, allow it to remain on the platform for 15 sec.",
    "Note: This allows the animal to orient to its spatial location within the room.\nAfter 15 sec on the platform, remove the animal from the maze and return the mouse to the heated cage.\nIf the mouse finds the platform and proceeds to jump or fall off prior to 15 sec, scoop the mouse and place it back on the platform for the remainder of the 15 sec so the mouse learns to associate the platform with escape.\nIf the mouse does not locate the platform within 60 sec, gently scoop the mouse and place it on the platform. Allow it to remain on the platform for 15 sec, then remove the animal with the scoop and bring it back to the heated cage.\nClean the maze of debris with a net to disrupt olfactory cues.\nRepeat these procedures for the remaining mice in the group. Thus, for testing days 4 through 9, conduct four trials of hidden platform training per day with approximately 20 min between each trial.\nChange the starting location pseduorandomly for each trial. Thus, during trial 1, release all mice from the same starting location, then repeat the procedure from a different starting position for the ensuing trials. Each day, vary the release points to ensure animals do not develop a non-spatial, non-hippocampal dependent motoric strategy. For example, if mice are released from N, S, E, and W points on day one, do not release them in that same order the following day.",
    "During hidden platform training, use the animal tracking software to measure latency to reach the platform, the pathlength of the animal, and the percentage of time or distance the animal spends in each maze quadrant. Obtain these measurements from the “Water maze” tab under “Experiment list” and can be exported directly to an excel spreadsheet.\n\t\tNote: The use of a hand timer ensures the accuracy of the tracking software.\n4. Probe Trials\nSetup the Mouse Performance Tracking Software\n\t\nUse the same procedures as in the Morris water maze hidden platform procedure (steps 3.2.1-3.2.4.3) with one exception. Critical step: For probe trials, ensure the “stop” option for “trigger” is turned off during probe trials. This will prevent the program from stopping when a mouse crosses the platform area.\nCreating the Run Sheets\n\t\nCreate a run sheet listing each mouse, each trial, and a space to note aberrant behavior. Pre-determine the release point during the probe trials such that they alternate between the two sides opposite the platform. Thus, pre-determine the release points such that mice are not released from the two sides that are adjacent to the platform.\nProcedure\n\t\nConduct probe trials similar to hidden platform training, with the exception that no platform is in the maze.\nRelease a mouse from a predetermined release point. During the probe trial, remove the platform and the mouse has 60 sec to swim in the maze.\nDuring testing, conduct 4 probe trials. Alter the release point of the mice between the probe trials. Thus, change the release point of the current probe trial from that of the previous probe trial.",
    "During the probe trials, use the animal tracking software to track the pathlength of the animal, the percentage of time the animal spends in each quadrant of the maze, and the number of times an animal swims over the previously platformed area. Obtain these measurements from the “Data analysis” tab and the “Water maze” tab under “Experimental list”, and export directly to an excel spreadsheet.\n\t\tNote: The use of a hand timer can also be beneficial to ensure the accuracy of the tracking software.\nConduct a probe trial prior to hidden platform training on days 6, 7, 8 and 10. (Figure 2). After these probe trials, carry out 4 trials of hidden platform training each day. Thus, perform a probe first, immediately followed by hidden platform training for all mice using the same procedures as described in section 3. In contrast, do not perform additional hidden platform training after the probe trial on day 10.\n5. Analyses\nVisible Platform Training\n\t\nConduct repeated measures ANOVAs separately for (a) pathlength, (b) latency to find the platform, and (c) swim speed, with transgene (or another variable, such as treatment) as the between-subject variable and days or training blocks as the within-subject variable. Note: For more complex designs, a consultation with a statistician can be useful. See 8,13 for information on group sizes sufficient to properly power this task with commonly used models of Alzheimer’s disease.\nPerformance Incompetence\n\t\t\nIdentify performance-incompetent mice, including mice that demonstrate visual or motor incompetence, or animals that do not acquire the procedural components of the test, and remove these mice from subsequent statistical analyses of hidden platform and probe performance.",
    "Calculate the mean latency and swim speed for the last day of visible platform training for each mouse. Remove mice with means 2 standard deviations above the group mean, as this may be indicative of motor or visual impairments.\nIdentify and remove mice failing to orient to or follow the escape scoop, or mice exhibiting aberrant behavior, such as cork-screw swimming or floating.\nMorris Water Maze Hidden Platform Training\n\t\nConduct repeated measures ANOVAs on (a) pathlength, (b) latency to find the hidden platform, (c) swim speed, and (d) percent time or percent distance in quadrant with transgene as the between-subject variable and trials as the within-subject variable.\nProbe Trials\n\t\nSwim speed\n\t\t\nConduct repeated measures ANOVAs on swim speed across probe trials with transgene as the between-subject variable and trials as the within-subject variable.\nPlatform crossing index\n\t\t\nUsing the probe trial configuration for each mouse, platform crossing index (PCI) is computed using the following formula:  PCI = number of times the mouse crosses the target location – average crossings of the equivalent location in the other 3 quadrants.\n\t\t\t​Note: This is conducted to determine whether the mouse is using a spatial search strategy, as indicated by more crossings over the trained platform location, or a non-spatial strategy of thigmotaxic swimming, as indicated by approximately equal crossings over all four locations.\nConduct repeated measures ANOVAs on PCI with transgene as the between-subject variable and trials as the within-subject variable.\nPercent time or percent distance in quadrant",
    "Compute the percent time or distance each mouse spends in the four quadrants of the maze. Conduct repeated measures ANOVAS on the percent of time, or distance, with transgene as the between-subject variable and trials as the within-subject variable. Use the percent time to determine whether a spatial search strategy is being used; findings of approximately 25% time in the target quadrant indicate mice are performing at chance level and not using a spatial search strategy.\nO/N forgetting\n\t\t\nCompare the latency of platform area crossing on the probe trial to the latency to locate the platform on the final trial of the previous day. Note: If the latency of the platform crossing on the probe trial is significantly longer than the latency to find the platform during the last trial of hidden platform on the previous day, then O/N forgetting of the platform location is occurring.\nPost Hoc Analysis\n\t\nFollow significant RMANOVAs with post hoc comparisons of transgene at each trial.\n6. Example of Re-optimization for a New Testing Environment\nPre-handling. Conduct pre-handling in the housing room. Place the cages without lids on a transport cart for the entire session.\n\tNote: Objectives for modification of the pre-handling procedure are to more gradually introduce handler manipulations and exposure to the transportation devices (beaker and scoop) and to increase the time mice are in the home cage without microisolator lids and outside of their cage in an open field and brighter light conditions.\n\t\nDays 1 and 2\n\t\t\nAllow mice to acclimate to hands being in the cage, followed by gentle touching, followed by being lifted for tattoo inspection and marking of the tail. Starting on Day 2 of pre-handling, place supplemental nesting material in the cage to provide additional material for nest building and shelter while lids have been removed 9.",
    "Days 3 and 4\n\t\t\nPlace the transport beaker, scoop, and flag of the visible platform in the pre-handling box and allow mice to explore for  2 trials at 2 min per trial.\nDo not use water in this protocol during pre-handling. Rather, ensure the box contains enough clean bedding to cover the floor and is scented with a small amount of female and male soiled litter if both genders are being tested. Change the bedding each day.\nDay 5\n\t\t\nPlace mice in the pre-handling box containing lightly soiled litter and the visible platform flag for 3 trials, for 20 sec each. Use the beaker and the scoop to transport the mice to and from the box.\nVisible Platform Training\n\t\nSet water temperature at 27 °C (routinely used for the Minnesota testing environment).\nReturn the mice to the home cage upon acquiring the cued platform.\nAllow mice up to 60 sec to acquire the visible platform.\nConduct training sessions consisting of 3 trials per day for 5 days.\nHidden Platform Training\n\t\nModify visual cues. Except for one large curtain to obscure the handler, either eliminate or make narrower other curtains surrounding the pool so as to have a more open room. Place additional objects about the room (e.g., exposed shelving, black fabric poster with a white symbol, a black and white beach ball, large black funnels, notebooks, and a black stuffed animal), resulting in a balanced but more varied visual cue-set than previously used.\nBegin hidden platform training 72 hr following completion of visible platform training, with an interval of approximately 30 min between trials.\nConduct training sessions consisting of 2 trials for 8 days.\nProbe Trials\n\t\nPerform probe trials 72 hr following hidden training trials 8, 12, and 16.Include a 3-day interval between trials 8-9, and 12-13 of training.",
