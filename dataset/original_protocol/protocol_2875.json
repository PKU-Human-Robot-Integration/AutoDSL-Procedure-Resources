    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nGeneration of KHYG-1 cell line stably expressing FCγRIIIa (CD16)\nTiming: 2 weeks\nImmortalized natural killer cell lines, including the KHYG-1 cell line, either do not express Fc receptor FcyRIIIa (CD16) or rapidly lose its expression in culture.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4],5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] CD16 expression is essential for recognition of therapeutic antibodies and killing of cancer cells through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Two variants of this receptor have been described, CD16 variant V158 shows increased antibody binding and increased cytotoxicity versus the F158 variant.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6],7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] This step describes the generation of a natural killer cell line stably expressing CD16 (V158) that induces potent and specific ADCC. Starting with the generation of retroviruses with a CD16-V158 variant expression construct (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A), these retroviruses are used to transduce KHYG-1 natural killer cells and stably insert the CD16-V158 construct into the genomic DNA. Cell line KHYG-1 (DSMZ ACC 725) was established and described in 19971[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] and obtained from Leibniz Institute DSMZ - German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2584-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

KHYG-1 CD16+ cells stably express CD16 for over 3 months.\nNote: Use freshly thawed phoenix AMPHO cells at around 80% confluence. Seed phoenix AMPHO cells in antibiotic free medium before transfection.\nDay 1.\nFor the reverse transfection prepare DNA lipofectamine2000 complexes.\nAdd 12 μg of pMSCV_IRES_GFP_CD16a vector to 1.5 mL optimem in a 15 mL tube. Mix by tapping gently.",
    "Add 36 μL lipofectamine 2000 to 1.5 mL optimem in a 15 mL tube. Mix by tapping gently and incubate at 20°C–25°C for 5 min.\nAdd the diluted lipofectamine 2000 to the diluted DNA. Mix by tapping gently.\nIncubate for 20 min at 20°C–25°C. Gently mix after 10 min.\nDuring DNA lipofectamine incubation prepare the phoenix AMPHO cells.\nTrypsinize and collect the phoenix AMPHO cells in a 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 210 × g for 5 min.\nCount the cells and resuspend cells to reach 1.2∗106 cells/mL in antibiotic-free medium.\nAdd 5 mL antibiotic-free medium to a 10 cm cell culture plate pre-coated with 0.1% gelatin.\nAdd DNA lipofectamine complexes in a drop wise fashion. Gently distribute the complexes in the plate with a cross-like movement.\nAdd 5 mL of cell suspension (6∗106 cells) to the plate. Gently distribute the cells in the plate with a cross-like movement.\nPlace in a 37°C 5% CO2 incubator.\nNote: From now on retrovirus particles will be present. Work with the appropriate biosafety precautions.\nDay 2.\nReplace medium 24 h after transfection.\nCarefully remove and discard the medium.\nGently add 6 mL KHYG-1 culture medium without IL-2 or antibiotics.\nIncubate overnight in a 32°C 5% CO2 incubator.\nNote: As the vector contains GFP, fluorescent microscopy can be used to assess transfection efficiency.\nCritical: Virus collection medium should be similar to the medium used for culturing the KHYG-1 cells, as this medium will be used for transduction of the KHYG-1 cells.\nCritical: Use 6 ml medium for viral collection as this is the minimum to cover a 10 cm dish and will result in a high viral titer.\nCritical: Viruses are more stable at 32°C. Producing the virus at 37°C will reduce the transduction efficiency.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]\nDay 3.\nCollect 48 h viral medium.",
    "Collect all medium (around 6 mL) from the phoenix cells and place into a 50 mL tube.\nOptional: Fresh medium can be added to the phoenix cells to collect 72 h viral medium.\nCentrifuge the viral medium at 400 × g for 5 min to pellet any cell debris.\nFilter the viral medium using a 0.45 μm filter.\nAdd 2.8 μL IL-2 (10 μg/mL) to 6 mL viral medium for a final concentration of 4.6 ng/mL.\nNote: Viral medium is best used directly but can be stored at 4°C for up to 1 week.\nTransduction of KHYG-1 cells.\nEquilibrate the viral medium to 20°C–25°C.\nTransfer 2 mL viral medium to a new 15 mL tube and add 1.6 μL of polybrene (stock 10 mg/mL) for a final concentration of 8 μg/mL.\nNote: Working polybrene concentration varies for different cell lines. In our experience 8 μg/ml works well for KHYG-1 cells.\nCount KHYG-1 cells and prepare two 15 mL tubes with 2∗106 cells. Centrifuge at 210 × g for 5 min.\nNote: Use fresh KHYG-1 cells that have recovered from thawing (this takes about 2 weeks) with at least 95% cell viability. Seed cells at 0.4∗106 cells/ml in antibiotic free medium the day before transduction.\nNote: Cell density at transduction is 0.5∗106 cells/ml.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend cells from one tube in 2 mL viral medium with polybrene and cells from the other tube in 2 mL growth medium, as a negative control.\nSeed 2∗106 cells in the middle wells of a 6-well plate.\nTape the plate to prevent spilling of the viruses.\nCentrifuge the plate at 560 × g for 45 min with low acceleration (=1/9) and deceleration (=1/9). Use swinging buckets.\nRemove the tape and place the plate in a 32°C 5% CO2 incubator for 16–24 h.",
    "Critical: IL-2 in the medium is essential for KHYG-1 maintenance and efficient transduction.\nNote: Centrifuging the cells with viral medium greatly improves transduction efficiency.\nDay 4.\nCollect control and transduced cells in a 15 mL tube and centrifuge at 210 × g for 5 min.\nRemove supernatant, count the cells and seed in antibiotic free KHYG-1 medium to a cell density of 0.5∗106 cells/mL in a 6-well plate.\nPlace the cells back in the 32°C 5% CO2 incubator.\nNote: Use bleach to inactivate the viral particles in the discarded medium.\nDay 5.\nCollect control and transduced cells in a 15 mL tube and centrifuge at 210 × g for 5 min.\nRemove supernatant and seed the transduced cells in 10 mL KHYG-1 medium with antibiotics into a 10 cm dish.\nPlace the cells in a 37°C 5% CO2 incubator for 72 h to recover.\nDay 8.\nStart antibiotic selection of the transduced and control cells.\nCount transduced and control KHYG-1 cells and seed at a density of 0.3∗106 cells/mL in culture medium supplemented with 1 μg/mL puromycin.\nRefresh medium with puromycin every 2–3 days. Monitor cell death of the transduced and control cells by resuspending the cells and counting them using trypan blue.",
    "Note: Culture conditions can impact sensitivity to puromycin. It is recommended to do a puromycin titration in advance to select the optimal concentration for killing of the wild type cells. For example, in a 12-well plate seed 1 ml of 0.3∗106 cells/ml cell suspension in 7 wells. To the wells add 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 or 30 μl 10 mg/ml puromycin for a final concentration of 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 or 3 μg/ml. Replace medium after 2 days. After 4 days assess cell death. The optimal puromycin concentration for selection is the lowest concentration at which all wild type cells are dead.\nDay 15.\nAfter 7 days all control cells should be dead. Expand the transduced cells in KHYG-1 culture medium until freezing.\nFreeze 2∗106 cells/mL in 20% FBS and 10% DMSO KHYG-1 culture medium as described in step 5 of culturing of KHYG-1 (CD16+) cells.\nCD16 expression analysis\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step describes how to monitor the expression of FcyRIIIa (CD16) on the cell surface of KHYG-1 cells after transduction and selection with puromycin. The construct used for transduction also contains the EGFP gene connected to the gene for selection (pac) with an IRES element. GFP fluorescence can be used as a reporter of the integration of the construct in the genomic DNA of the KHYG-1 cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nCollect wild type KHYG-1 and transduced KHYG-1 cells in a 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 250 × g for 2 min at 20°C–25°C.\nRemove supernatant, resuspend cells in 2 mL PBS and count.\nMove 6∗104 cells into two 1.5 mL tubes per cell line.\nCentrifuge at 250 × g for 2 min at 20°C–25°C.\nPrepare antibody dilutions (in the dark, on ice).",
    "Add 2 μL IgG-PE or CD16-PE in 50 μL PBS 1% BSA per sample.\nResuspend cells in 50 μL IgG-PE or CD16-PE dilution.\nIncubate for 45 min at 4°C in the dark while rotating.\nWash 3 times with 200 μL PBS 1% BSA.\nResuspend cells in 0.5 mL PBS 1% BSA and transfer cells to a flow cytometry tube.\nAnalyze GFP and PE signal by flow cytometry using the LSRFortessa.\nAlternative: The same procedure can be performed in a 96-well plate when handling a lot of samples.\nCo-culture setup\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step describes how to prepare and plate effector and target cells and antibody solutions for the ADCC assay (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Initially, a serial dilution of trastuzumab can be performed to determine optimal antibody concentration (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). We have determined a concentration 1 μg/mL of trastuzumab as the lowest concentration to obtain the highest cytotoxicity from KHYG-1 CD16+ cells in co-culture assays using 1∗104 BT474 target cells at a 5:1 effector:target ratio (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). This concentration is used for comparing different target and effector cell lines and effector:target ratios (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2584-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Schematics for co-culture conditions\nConditions required in each plate (preferably as triplicates in 3 wells) are: medium only (wells A–C in column 1) and medium with lysis buffer (wells D–F in column 1) to measure the medium background signal, target cells with antibody to measure target spontaneous release (column 3), lysed target cells to measure the target maximum release (column 4), natural killer cells with antibody to measure effector spontaneous release (column 2), co-culture of effector and target cells without antibody for detecting nonspecific cytotoxicity (column 5) and co-culture of effector and target cells with antibody for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) (column 6).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2584-Fig4.jpg",

In both cases the steps are: 1) Plating of target cell lines (light and dark brown refer to 2 different target cell lines). Medium (pink) is added to wells without target cells. 2) Addition of only medium (pink) or antibody (yellow). 3) Seeding of KHYG-1 CD16+ cells (purple) at fixed ratio for antibody titrations experiments (A) or at different effector:target ratios (B). Lysis buffer is added to wells D–F in column 1 and wells A–F in column 4 (A) or wells A–F in column 6 (B) 45 min before the end of the co-culture incubation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2584-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Co-culture conditions influencing LDH release and cytotoxicity\n(A) Normalized cellular cytotoxicity of KHYG-1 CD16+ cells on BT474 target cells in the presence of different antibody concentrations (0.001–2 μg/mL trastuzumab) at an effector:target ratio of 5:1 (n = 2).

LDH release is normalized to cells cultured without antibody (n = 3). Error bars represent standard error of the mean (SEM).\n(E) LDH release of 1∗103 to 4∗104 BT474 (blue), MCF7 (green) and MDAMB361 (red) cells with or without lysis buffer.",
    "(F and G) LDH release of KHYG-1 CD16+ and BT474 alone or in co-culture after 6 h (F) or 24 h (G) incubation.\n(H) For the BT474 cell line, but not for the MDA-MB-361 cell line, antibody-dependent KHYG-1 CD16+ mediated cell killing is enhanced by increasing assay time from 6 h to 24 h.\nWe recommend using a range of 5∗104 to 2∗105 target cells per well. Decreasing the cell number reduces the detection window between the target cell background LDH release and the target cell maximum (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]E). This will compromise the ability to detect cytotoxicity changes. The effector:target ratio is limited by the concentration of KHYG-1 cells as exceeding 1∗106 cells/mL results in reduced proliferation and loss of cytotoxicity.\nNote: To minimize pipetting errors and produce more reliable results, use a multichannel pipet for transferring cells, antibody or medium to the 96-well plate.\nNote: Always use triplicates for each co-culture condition.\nOptional: IL-2 preactivation enhances ADCC,9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] but is not absolutely required during the assay (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nCalculate the number of cells needed for the experiment taking into account that 1∗104 target cells will be seeded per well in a 96-well plate.\nPrepare target cells suspension.\nHarvest target cells (BT474, MCF7 or MDA-MB-361).\nCentrifuge at 210 × g for 5 min.\nResuspend cells in ADCC assay medium and count.\nPrepare a cell suspension of target cells of 2∗105 cells/mL.\nPlate 50 μL of target cell suspension in the appropriate wells of a round bottom 96-well plate to get 1∗104 cells per well (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nCritical: Use a round bottom 96-well plate to ensure interaction between the effector and target cells. A flat bottom plate will yield no to little cytotoxicity in this setup.\nAdd 50 μL ADCC assay medium to wells without target cells.\nPrepare antibody dilutions.",
    "Prepare a 10× dilution of trastuzumab for a stock concentration of 2.1 mg/mL.\nPrepare 2× concentrated working stocks of trastuzumab, because the trastuzumab will be diluted 1:2 when added to the wells containing 50 μL medium.\nNote: Trastuzumab is also added to control wells with only target cells or effector cells. This does not alter the viability of these cells as measured by LDH release (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D).\nFor Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A - antibody serial dilutions: First prepare a 4 μg/mL working stock by adding 1.4 μL trastuzumab (2.1 mg/mL) to 750 μL ADCC assay medium.
