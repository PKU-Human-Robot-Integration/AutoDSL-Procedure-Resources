    "The reaction partners first need to be activated with a chemical crosslinker to allow covalent binding of the antibodies to the beads. The reaction using EDAC [1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide-hydrochloride] should mainly result in amide bonds between any carboxyl groups of the antibodies and the amine groups of the beads, but EDAC has no specificity for this reaction, so crosslinking of different reactive groups of the antibodies is also possible. The concentration of EDAC, the sequence in which the different reagents are added, and the timing of the incubation, therefore, are critical.\nMaterials\nAliphatic Amine Latex Beads [2% (w/v); ∼3 × 107/ml; Thermo Fisher Scientific, SKU no.

Use approximate concentration of the Aliphatic Amine Latex Beads as delivered (3 × 107/ml) to estimate the volume needed for the entire experiment. Mix beads well and place this volume plus ∼10% more (to account for variations and loss during sample processing) in an appropriate conical centrifuge tube (e.g., a 1.5-ml tube for volumes <400 µl or a 15-ml tube for larger volumes).",
    "2. Wash beads twice with an excess (at least twice the volume of the bead suspension) of 1× MES buffer with 0.1% SDS. Mix well and spin down 5 min at 5000 × g in a microcentrifuge or 1000 × g in a centrifuge with a swinging bucket. Aspirate supernatant carefully so as not to disrupt the pellet.\nAlways store the 1× MES buffer with 0.1% SDS at room temperature and check for precipitates of SDS before use. If necessary, warm the buffer to 37°C to completely dissolve the SDS.\nYou can minimize loss of beads by using a centrifuge with a swinging bucket. In any case, be careful because the pellet is fragile.\n3. Dilute beads in 1× MES buffer with 0.1% SDS, count beads using a cell counter (e.g., CASY) or a hemocytometer and microscope, and wash for a third time (see step 2). Calculate exact amount of beads in the tube and resuspend them in 30 µl of 1× MES buffer with 0.1% SDS per 1 million beads (3.3 × 107/ml).\nUsing a CASY cell counter with settings identical to those for lymphocytes works fine, but you can also count with a hemocytometer as the beads are as big as lymphocytes. You should dilute the bead sample appropriately for the counting method that you are using. With our CASY settings, a pre-dilution of 1:10 compared to the initial volume of the bead suspension is usually within the good range.\n4. Add EDAC in anhydrous DMSO to beads to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml.",
    "EDAC hydrolyzes pretty quickly just by opening the container repeatedly and loses its activity. We recommend preparing a 100 mg/ml stock solution in water-free DMSO and storing it at −20°C because it can be reused several times without a reduction in activity. EDAC does not dissolve well in DMSO, so you might have to warm the tube to 37°C and vortex vigorously.\n5. Incubate for 30 min at room temperature on an end-over-end rotator.\n6. Wash beads once with an excess of 1× MES buffer with 0.1% SDS (see step 2) and resuspend in 30 µl of 1× MES buffer (without SDS) per 1 million beads (3.3 × 107/ml).\n7. Add desired amount of unconjugated monoclonal mouse IgG antibody to the beads and incubate for 1 hr at room temperature on an end-over-end rotator.\nUse a standardized unit to make comparisons between experiments possible, e.g., µg antibody per million beads. Concentrations between 10 ng and 2 µg per million beads should yield good titrations.\nInclude at least one sample without antibody and, if applicable, another negative control appropriate to your experiment.\n8. Add 20 µg BSA per million beads to bead/antibody mix and continue incubation on rotator for an additional 30 min.\nA stock solution of BSA of 10 µg/µl in 1× MES buffer is convenient here.\nAlso add this to the sample without antibody.\n9. Wash beads twice with an excess of DPBS (see step 2).\nCount the beads diluted in DPBS (see step 3) before the final wash step because some beads will be lost during the coating process and this may vary between samples. To make sure that the correct amount is used in your experiments and that different samples are comparable, it is essential to adjust concentrations.",
    "10. Use beads directly or resuspend beads in storage buffer, e.g., at a concentration of 1 × 107 beads/ml, and store at 4°C until use (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.111#cpim111-prot-0002]).\nSee the Commentary for information about the stability of the coated beads.",
    "The manual for the QIFIKIT® provides plenty of information on how different samples can be prepared and analyzed. Nevertheless, we describe here how we adapted this protocol to fit the requirements of our assay.\nMaterials\nQIFIKIT®, including tubes containing setup and calibration beads and labeled secondary antibody (Dako/Agilent, cat. no. K0078)\nAntibody-coated latex beads (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.111#cpim111-prot-0001])\nFACS buffer [PBS with 2% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS)] with or without 2% (w/v) formaldehyde\n96-V-well plate\nCentrifuge with swinging bucket\nFlow cytometer and analysis software\nSpreadsheet program\n1. Vortex tubes containing the setup beads and the calibration beads of the QIFIKIT® and transfer 50 µl of each to a 96-V-well plate.\nThe QIFIKIT® manual uses 100 µl each, but results using fewer beads are comparable.\nYou can also perform the staining in other vessels, but using 96-V-well plates worked best in our hands to reduce sample loss and to guarantee equal treatment and comparability of samples.\n2. Take same amount of antibody-coated latex beads to be quantified from each condition (100,000 to 200,000 beads per sample) and transfer these samples to 96-V-well plate. Include one sample as an unstained control.\n3. Wash QIFIKIT® beads and latex beads once by adding 150 µl FACS buffer to each well of the 96-V-well plate, centrifuging 5 min at 500 × g in a centrifuge with a swinging bucket, and aspirating the supernatant.\n4. Prepare a master mix of labeled secondary antibody in FACS buffer. Resuspend all beads except unstained control (just QIFIKIT® beads and latex beads) in 50 µl of this master mix. Incubate for 20 min at room temperature in the dark.",
    "The QIFIKIT® contains a FITC-labeled anti-mouse antibody, which should be diluted 1:50 and works fine. However, we usually use a PE-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (e.g., Goat Anti Mouse F(ab)2 IgG (H+L) PE, Dianova, cat. no. 115-116-146) diluted 1:200 because we found that the assay was more sensitive, with a better, lower detection limit, when we used the brighter PE fluorophore.\n5. Wash once with 150 µl FACS buffer (see step 3) and resuspend beads in 100 to 150 µl FACS buffer with or without 2% (w/v) formaldehyde per sample.\nUse FACS buffer if you can analyze the samples directly or FACS buffer with 2% formaldehyde to fix the samples and analyze the beads the next day.\nMake sure the QIFIKIT® beads are treated in the same way as the other samples.\n6. Analyze samples using a flow cytometer.\nThe beads from the QIFIKIT® and the latex beads have very similar FSC and SSC signals. Adjust the amplification so that you can nicely separate beads from debris and draw a gate in FSC and SSC around the main population, excluding debris and aggregates (Fig. 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.111#cpim111-fig-0001] and 1D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.111#cpim111-fig-0001]). Look at events from this gate in the fluorescence channel that you used (FITC or PE) on a logarithmic scale. Set the amplification of this channel so that you can see both populations of the setup beads (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.111#cpim111-fig-0001]). The higher population may be close to, but not at, the maximal detection limit. Then, record the setup and calibration beads and your latex beads without changing the settings.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5e716a02-c7da-4d4b-a014-d18b8b9d53c4/cpim111-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1",
    "Analysis of the antibody coating with the QIFIKIT®, with exemplary quantification of antibody-coated beads. (A) Beads from the QIFIKIT® are first gated via their FSC and SSC signals. A gate is drawn around the main population of single beads and excludes debris and aggregates. (B) The fluorescence channel is set to logarithmic scale, and both populations of the setup beads must be visible. (C) The five populations of the calibration beads are clearly separated. All beads have to be recorded without changing the settings of the fluorescence channel. (D) The latex beads have very similar FSC and SSC signals as the beads from the QIFIKIT®, so the same settings and gating can also be applied here. (E) The beads coated with αNKp30 show only one narrow peak at all antibody concentrations and therefore are homogeneously coated. (F) Two populations among the beads coated with αNKG2D show heterogeneous coating: at 80 ng/Mio, there are two peaks visible, and at 250 ng/Mio, the population is smeared across a wide range. Depending on the intended use of the beads, those samples might have to be excluded. (G) After drawing gates around the individual populations of the setup and the calibration beads (B and C), a linear regression is calculated from the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and the antibody binding capacity (ABC) values of the five calibration bead populations using a spreadsheet program. With the linear regression, the ABCs of the beads coated with αNKp30 can be calculated from their MFI values (G, gray symbols).\n7. Perform analysis using analysis software and a spreadsheet program.",
    "In the analysis software, you now need to gate on single beads using FSC and SSC signals. Display the fluorescence channel as a histogram. For the beads from the QIFIKIT®, you need to draw additional gates around the individual populations: two in the setup beads and five in the calibration beads (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.111#cpim111-fig-0001] and 1C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.111#cpim111-fig-0001]). Then, export the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values of these populations to a table or spreadsheet program.\nIf the latex beads are coated homogeneously, you will see only one narrow peak, but, especially at very low antibody concentrations, the coating can be heterogeneous. In the case that you have more than one peak or a very smeared population, we recommend repeating the coating (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.111#cpim111-prot-0001]).\nFor the calibration beads, the QIFIKIT® provides information about the exact number of antibodies bound to the surface, which is called antibody binding capacity (ABC), for each of the five populations. Using the logarithm of the ABC and the logarithm of the corresponding MFI, a linear regression can be calculated:\nlog (ABC) = a × log (MFI) + b. Using this formula, the ABC of the latex beads can be calculated from their MFI. Also perform this calculation for the negative-control beads without antibody coating that have been stained in the same way. Subtract this from the ABCs of the other beads for background correction.",
    "Following the steps of Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.111#cpim111-prot-0001], virtually any protein can be covalently bound to the beads; we use this protocol to coat the beads with streptavidin at one constant concentration. These beads can then bind any biotinylated protein. The amount of protein on the surface can be modified by titrating the recombinant biotinylated protein. Additionally, when the biotinylation of the protein is targeted, correct orientation on the beads can be ensured.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.111#cpim111-prot-0001])\nStreptavidin (BioLegend, cat. no. 405150)\nFACS buffer: PBS with 2% (v/v) FBS\nBiotinylated protein (biotin: Sigma, cat. no. B4501)\n1. Follow steps 1 to 6 of Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.111#cpim111-prot-0001].\n2. Add 0.5 µg streptavidin per million beads and incubate for 1 hr at room temperature on an end-over-end rotator.\nHere, we do not use uncoated beads as a negative control, but rather streptavidin beads without biotinylated protein added (see step 4).\n3. Continue with steps 8 and 9 of Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.111#cpim111-prot-0001].\n4. Resuspend beads in storage buffer, e.g., at a concentration of 1 × 107 beads/ml, and store them at 4°C. To bind biotinylated protein to the beads, incubate beads for 20 min at room temperature in FACS buffer containing the biotinylated protein.\nSimilar to direct coating with antibodies (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.111#cpim111-prot-0001]), concentrations between 10 ng and 2 µg per million beads have yielded good titrations in our experiments. Include a negative control without protein.\nFree streptavidin on the beads might interact with biotin in later stages of your experiment if the sites are not already blocked, e.g., by incubation in cell culture medium that contains biotin. In the case that you expect that free streptavidin could cause problems, add an additional blocking step with 10 µM biotin for 20 min at room temperature.",
    "5. Wash beads twice with an excess of FACS buffer (see step 2 of Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.111#cpim111-prot-0001]).\n6.

    "To quantify the protein loaded onto the beads with Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.111#cpim111-prot-0003], one additional step is needed relative to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.111#cpim111-prot-0002], but it can be done very easily with the QIFIKIT®.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.111#cpim111-prot-0002])\nStreptavidin-coated latex beads with or without biotinylated protein (see Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.111#cpim111-prot-0003])\nUnconjugated monoclonal mouse IgG antibodies against biotinylated proteins used (see Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.111#cpim111-prot-0003])\n1. Take same amount of streptavidin-coated latex beads with biotinylated protein to be quantified from each condition (100,000 to 200,000 beads per sample) and transfer them to a 96-V-well plate. Include one sample of streptavidin-coated latex beads without biotinylated protein for each antibody that is going to be used. If the beads are in storage buffer, wash them once by adding 150 µl FACS buffer to each well of beads in the 96-V-well plate, centrifuging 5 min at 500 × g, and aspirating supernatant.\n2. Resuspend beads in 50 µl FACS buffer containing 5 µg/ml unconjugated monoclonal mouse IgG antibody against the respective biotinylated protein used. Treat sample of streptavidin-only beads in the same way. Incubate for 20 min at room temperature.\nThe antibody concentration must be saturating so that one epitope on the bead corresponds to one antibody bound.\n3. Wash beads once with 150 µl FACS buffer. Prepare setup and calibration beads from the QIFIKIT® as in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.111#cpim111-prot-0002], steps 1 and 3.\n4. Prepare a master mix of labeled secondary antibody in FACS buffer and resuspend all samples in 50 µl of this master mix. Incubate for 20 min at room temperature in the dark.\nSee the annotation to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.111#cpim111-prot-0002], step 4, for more information about the antibody.\n5. Follow steps 5 to 7 of Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.111#cpim111-prot-0002].",
    "The ABC of the latex beads can be calculated in the same way as in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.111#cpim111-prot-0002]. Use the beads coated with streptavidin only and stained with the same antibody for background correction and subtract this from the ABC of the protein-coated beads.",
    "One of the main functional assays that we use and an excellent way to test beads that are coated with antibodies (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.111#cpim111-prot-0001]) that are directed against activating NK cell receptors is a degranulation assay that detects surface CD107a. We use antibodies to coat the beads that have been successfully used in our laboratory to stimulate NK cells via other methods.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.111#cpim111-prot-0002])\nPreferred culture medium for NK cells\nNK cells (e.g., primary human NK cells or NK-92 cell line)\nαCD107a (clone H4A3) PE-Cy5 (BD Pharmingen, cat. no. 555802)\nNOTE: All solutions and equipment coming into contact with cells must be sterile, and proper sterile technique should be used accordingly.\nNOTE: All culture incubations are performed in a humidified 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator unless otherwise specified.\n1. Take same amount of antibody-coated latex beads from each sample to test (e.g., 1 × 105) and transfer them to a 96-V-well plate.\n2. Wash beads once with 100 µl of the preferred culture medium for NK cells to remove the storage buffer. Centrifuge 5 min at 500 × g in a centrifuge with a swinging bucket and aspirate supernatant.\n3. Count NK cells, centrifuge 5 min at 500 × g if necessary, and resuspend the same number of cells as beads (1:1 ratio) at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml in culture medium.\nAs beads and NK cells are used at a 1:1 ratio, for example, you need 1 × 105 NK cells per sample of 1 × 105 beads and 2 × 105 NK cells for control samples.",
    "4. Allocate NK cells (e.g., 1 × 105 NK cells in 50 µl) as an unstained control in an empty well of the 96-V-well plate. Add 0.2 µg/ml αCD107a PE-Cy5 to remaining NK cell suspension and mix by carefully inverting tube. Remove NK cells (e.g., 1 × 105 NK cells in 50 µl) as an unstimulated control. Then, resuspend beads in 50 µl NK cell mix per sample.\n5. Incubate 96-V-well plate containing control cells and samples mixed with beads for 3 hr in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.\n6. Wash all samples once with 150 µl FACS buffer and resuspend them in 150 µl FACS buffer.\n7. Analyze samples directly using a flow cytometer or store them for a short time at 4°C protected from light before flow cytometry.\n8. Perform analysis using analysis software and a spreadsheet program.\nAlthough the latex beads are similar in size to NK cells, the SSC signals are very different. Adjust the amplification of both scatters so that both the NK cell and the latex bead populations are visible. Draw gates around the NK cell population, excluding cell debris, and a gate around the bead population, which can include conjugates between NK cells and beads (see Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.111#cpim111-fig-0002] and 2C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.111#cpim111-fig-0002]). Set the flow cytometer to acquire fluorescence of PE-Cy5. The autofluorescence of the beads is very similar to the signal for NK cells, with the exception of a higher signal at 450 nm after excitation at 405 nm. You can use this in addition to the SSC signal to distinguish single cells, beads, and conjugates.",
    "To analyze the percentage of degranulating NK cells, you can combine the NK cell gate and the latex bead gate in a boolean OR gate. Look at events within this combined gate using the bead autofluorescence and the PE-Cy5 signal (Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.111#cpim111-fig-0002] and 2D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.111#cpim111-fig-0002]). In Quadrant 1 (Q1), you see single beads. Q4 is NK cells that have not degranulated, Q3 is NK cells that have degranulated, and Q2 is NK cells that have degranulated and are still attached to a bead. The formula to calculate the percentage of degranulating NK cells is\n         imgsrc:/cms/asset/c1c9bb86-cac8-4d26-9386-ab9221d3e733/cpim111-math-0001.png\nOf course, other gating strategies can also be applied; just make sure to exclude the beads and not to “lose” the conjugates when you want to analyze NK cells.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/cd6625ae-2687-4d82-b3a1-63a997c21e72/cpim111-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nDegranulation assay with primary NK cells and latex beads. The amplification of the SSC must be adjusted so that both the NK cell and the latex bead populations are visible (A). Beads without antibody do not form many conjugates with the NK cells, but the gating should include possible conjugates, as with αCD16-coated beads (C). With the bead autofluorescence that causes a higher signal at 450 nm after excitation at 405 nm, single NK cells can be distinguished from beads as well (B and D). The gates for αCD107a-positive events are set very strictly to only include the highly positive events. This is to avoid beads that had contact with a degranulating cell and that also show slight staining with αCD107a (see D, Q1) being accidentally counted as NK cells."
