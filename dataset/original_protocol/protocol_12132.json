  "procedures": [
    "Institutional Review Board approval was obtained from The Ohio State University for this study and all participants signed an informed consent form.\n1. Characterize the High Stress Work Environment\nMeet with the managers and staff employees of the high stress environment separately from each other to characterize the impact of personal stress on the work environment. Assess various perspectives on the nature and sources of stress experienced by personnel. Ask both managers and staff employees for thoughts on causes and ways to modulate stress within the given environment.\nUtilize all pre-existing quality improvement data concerning the nature of staff satisfaction, sick leave data, job turnover data etc. to determine level of personnel stress.\n2. Determine Appropriate Location/time/interest for MIM\nCommunicate the research background on mindfulness and the intent to obtain institutional support for staff coverage necessary for participation.\nPresent findings of personnel stress assessment during staff meeting, determining time/location that would best work for MIM to be least disruptive for work flow.\n3. Obtain institutional support for MIM\nWork with administrative staff to allocate funding for coverage of staff attending MIM. Determine process for staff manager to solicit and schedule staff coverage for participants. Reserve location onsite for MIM.\nObtain written consent from interested employees so they fully understand the research, commitment involved in the intervention and understand that they can withdraw at any time, for any reason.\nDecide upon the outcomes that would be clinically significant for the particular employees.\n\tNOTE: For example, employees of ICU personnel showed a desire to become more resilient in spite of the daily stressors that they face in their day to day job and remain engaged in their important work.\n4. Baseline Assessments – 1 Week Prior to Intervention",
    "Measure resilience using the 10-items version of the Connor-Davidson Resiliency Scale (CD-RISC)41 1 week before intervention to establish a baseline.\n\t\nAsk participants to rate each of the 10 statements from 0 - 4 (not true at all, to true nearly all the time) indicating how often the statement applies to them.\nTally the total score by summing scores from each of the 10 statements.\n\t\tNOTE: Resilience corresponds to the ability to maintain good functioning in face of stress or trauma. The 10-items version of the CD- RISC has been validated with good reliability (alpha value of 0.85) and validity to differentiate individuals functioning well after adversity from those who are not42.\nMeasure work engagement using the 9-item Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES)43 1 week before intervention to establish a baseline.\n\t\nAsk participants to rate each of the 9 statements from 0 - 6 (never to always) indicating how often the statement applies to them.\nTally the total score, as well as the 3 sub-scores for vigor, dedication and absorption.\n\t\tNOTE: Higher scores indicate higher work engagement. Internal consistency of the scale is demonstrated with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.92 for the total score, 0.86 for vigor, 0.86 for dedication, and 0.79 for absorption subscales43.\n5. MIM\nFollow the same format during each 1 hr weekly session of the 8 week program.\nBegin each session by asking participants to count their respiration by placing their right hand on their chest and counting only inhales for 30 sec as timed by the instructor. Ask each participant to record their breath count on a log provided.\nPlay relaxing music in the background to set the climate for MIM.",
    "State that the intent of the didactic/experiential sessions is to encourage the explicitly defined objective of the program: resiliency building and stress reduction through mindful awareness of habitual patterns of stress reactivity.\nEach week, deliver a prompt for contemplation during the next hour and assure the participants that the response to the prompt is personal and silent. Invite the participants to choose to share responses, without any pressure to verbalize personal reflections. The prompts directly relate to each weekly theme. Ask the participants to reflect upon the following prompts:\n\ttable:\n﻿0,1\nWeek,Prompt\n1,What physical or cognitive habits did you catch yourself doing during the last week?\n2,\"What thoughts or worries keep you up at night? What thought, if you could put it out of your mind, would allow you to sleep better?\"\n3,What commonalities or differences do you see in your self-image versus how other people see you? What image of self allows you to breathe easier and deeper?\n4,Describe the most relaxed and satisfying meal you can remember. What factors made it so enjoyable?\n5,Are there any factors you can identify that were present during the times in your life when you felt balanced?\n6,What do you notice about the commonalities between the experiences you judge as “pleasant?” What about the experiences you judge as “unpleasant?”\n7,\"Is the “thing/person/situation” that is making you unhappy unchangeable? If so, how might you be able to change your reaction to it or experience of that “thing/person/situation?”\"\n8,Describe a time at work that you felt grounded and empowered.\nDeliver a 15 min Powerpoint presentation on topics including stress and work-related stress, theoretical material related to mindfulness, the somatic mind/body connection, relaxation, yoga, meditation, self-awareness, and bodily cues relating to emotional reactivity and the relation of these topics to the specific workplace stressors.",
    "Following the prompt, lead the participants through a mind body relaxation relating to the weekly prompts:\n\t\nWeek 1: Discuss what types of communication/relational patterns participants notice in life, and how there are also bodily patterns of which people are often unaware. Ask the participants to cross their arms over their chest, then, to cross their arms the opposite way and notice whether or not this feels uncomfortable, or unusual, as it is different than their typical habit of which arm is typically on top. Ask the participants to relax their feet, their legs, drop their weight into the chair, relax shoulders down, relax the muscles of the face. Mindfully relax all the muscles of their body.\nWeek 2: Ask the participants to settle into their chairs. Instruct the participants to close their eyes and begin a body scan, thereby tensing and relaxing each part of the body. Ask the participants to bring attention to their feet, legs, buttocks, stomach, chest, shoulders, lips, open and close the lower jaw, relaxing it.\nWeek 3: Ask the participants to become aware of their breathing by concentrating on the rise and fall of their chest. For just a few minutes, allow the mind-chatter to become quiet. Instruct the participants to tense each part of the body (the lower body, the torso, the neck and shoulders, the head) and then release the tension as each body part relaxes.",
    "Week 4: Pass out an orange and a small piece of dark chocolate. Instruct the participants to eat both of these with all five of their senses. For example, ensure that the participants hear the orange peel come off the orange, the wrapper off the chocolate. Direct the subjects to taste each of these 2 food items, smell each the orange and the chocolate, notice the difference and to notice the surface of the chocolate as opposed to the surface of the orange. Instruct the participants to take 3 min in silence to eat each of these 2 food items, noticing the experience, and the potential enhanced enjoyment of food, involved in mindful eating.\nWeek 5: Lead participants through yoga poses appropriate for the worksite, that can be performed without changing clothes or taking off one’s shoes38 (balancing poses such as tree pose, eagle pose and chair pose). Ask the participants to notice the factors that are helpful to physically balance their body in these poses.\nWeek 6: Guide the participants through a self-massage as an example of a pleasurable break from stress. Instruct the participants to use all ten finger tips to begin massaging their head and scalp, moving down the back of the neck. Use the left hand to massage the right side of the neck, down the upper arm, to the elbow, ending at the palm of the hand and the fingers. Repeat using the right hand to massage the left side of the body.",
    "Week 7: Ask participants to bring to mind the list of stressful items present in life. Instruct the participants to stand up. From a standing position, ask the participants to shift their weight to the right foot to represent the factors(e.g., people, situations, etc.) in their lives that cannot be changed, while tipping their torso to the left to represent the factors that are stressful yet are in part amendable to change. Ask participants to recognize that we all have both unchangeable and modifiable features present in our lives. Then ask the participants to rotate their shoulders in circles, followed by arms and hands moving in circles, ending by shaking out hands and participants return to seated position.\nWeek 8: Display an image of a mountain for the group. Ask the participants to imagine themselves as a solid mountain, with all the situations in life circling around the mountain while the mountain stays still. Imagine the body as an unmovable mountain.\nEnd each session by asking each participant to count their respirations for 30 sec and record their individual end-of-weekly-session breath count in the log provided. Assign the homework for the next week as follows.\n\t\nWeek 1: Ask the participants to notice each day the habits displayed – mental, physical, reactive, interactive. Instruct them to listen to a CD that has relaxing music in the background to reinforce the habit of relaxing for 20 min a day at least 5 days this week.\nAsk the participants to notice what comes to mind when awake at night, or unable to fall asleep. Instruct them to listen to a CD that has relaxing music in the background that encourages falling asleep for 20 min a day at least 5 days this week.",
    "Week 3: Ask the participants to notice breathing patterns this week in correlation with emotional states, and how breathing differently can change the emotional reactivity to a situation. Instruct them to listen to a CD that has relaxing music in the background that reinforces diaphragmatic breathing exercises that were practiced in the group session for 20 min a day at least 5 days this week.\nWeek 4: Ask the participants to notice where, when, and with whom meals are eaten, and the correlation with the enjoyment that is derived from eating food in a particular setting (for example in the car versus in one’s dining room). Instruct them to practice mindful eating during one meal a day at least 5 days this week to reinforce the pleasure that can be derived from eating mindfully.\nWeek 5: Ask the participants to notice on a daily basis when the feeling of balance is elicited by various situations or people. Instruct them to listen to a CD that has relaxing music in the background and that includes balancing yoga poses included for 20 min a day at least 5 days this week.\nWeek 6: Ask the participants to notice pleasurable versus uncomfortable sensations that occur daily and what or whom these experiences may be correlated with. Instruct them to listen to a CD that has relaxing music in the background that encourages pleasurable experiences 20 min a day at least 5 days this week.",
    "Week 7: Ask the participants to notice which situations may have an element that can be changed to make the situation itself less stressful. Instruct them to listen to a CD that has relaxing music in the background that encourages flexibility to reinforce the content presented in the group session for 20 min a day at least 5 days this week.\nWeek 8: Ask the participants to notice situations at work (frustrations, successes) that are comparable to passing conditions that will not move a solid mountain (the participant). Instruct them to listen to a CD that has relaxing music in the background that encourages staying grounded for 20 min a day at least 5 days this week.\n6. Evaluation of MIM Delivered Onsite\nOne week after the last session, ask the participants to rate the various component parts of the weekly sessions. Additionally, ask them to fill out a post intervention survey to measure resilience and engagement (see step 4.2 and 4.3).\nUsing a spreadsheet program evaluate the results obtained for differences in respiration by plotting the scores for that weekly session of the breath count (the average of all participants) at the beginning and end of each weekly session average breath count.\nIn a similar fashion, using a spreadsheet program, assess the resiliency and work engagement scores (total and sub-scales scores) for each group. Assess the changes between baseline and 2 month values in each study arm (MIM and group randomized to waitlist) using the paired t-test, consider P < 0.05 as significant."
