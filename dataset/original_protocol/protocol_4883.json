    "Extraction of total lipids from HeLa cells according to the protocol from Bligh and Dyer (1959)Plate 20 flasks of 150 cm2 with HeLa cells in complete DMEM medium and incubate them for 3 days at 37 °C, in presence of CO2 (up to 100% confluency).Rinse the monolayers with 20 ml of DPBS.Scrape the HeLa cells in DPBS and pool them in 50 ml DPBS in a 50 ml glass tube (PYREX® disposable glass conical centrifuge tubes without cap).Centrifuge the cells for 10 min, at 4 °C, 350 x g and get rid of the supernatant.In the fume hood, resuspend the cell pellet in 3 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:2) at room temperature.In the fume hood, vortex the cell lysate every 5 min for 30 min to solubilize the lipids (room temperature).In the fume hood, add 500 μl of chloroform and 900 μl of H2O, vortex.Centrifuge for 10 min at 1,300 x g, room temperature.In the fume hood, transfer the bottom organic phase into a new glass tube tube (Disposable screw thread culture tubes with marking spot, ø13 mm) (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161010/20161010191144_0966.jpgFigure 1. Photo of a tube showing the separation of the upper aqueous phase from the bottom organic phaseIn the fume hood, repeat the extraction with 500 μl of chloroform and 900 μl of H2O (steps A7-A9) to increase the lipid purity. In the fume hood, aliquot the bottom organic phase (1.5 ml per tube) into 5 ml glass tubes (disposable screw thread culture tubes). In the fume hood, evaporate the solvents under an N2 flux (0.5 to 1 psi). Note: This evaporation step also eliminates O2 molecules, which would oxidize the fatty acids of phospholipids.Keep the dried lipid films (~200 μg/tube) at -20 °C until being used.",
    "Note: Quantification of the glycerophospholipids is performed by gas chromatography after methanolysis (see next section).Quantification of extracted glycerophospholipids by gas chromatography after methanolysisTo separate the fatty acids from the glycerol backbones and methylate them, a lipid film (such as the ones obtained at the end of section A) is resuspended in 3 ml of 2.5% H2SO4 (in methanol). Resuspend by pipetting several times. This step must be performed under a fume hood.Add a specific fatty acid as internal standard dispersed in methanol, for example 1 nmol (this should represent a small volume: usually 1 or 2 μl) of C21:0.Seal the tube hermetically with a Teflon cap.The methylation of fatty acids is performed for 1 h at 100 °C in an oven.When the tube has cooled down (at room temperature: this takes just a few minutes), stop the reaction by adding 3 ml of H2O and mix by pipetting several times (in the fume hood).Phases are formed by the addition of 3 ml of hexane: mix by vortexing, centrifuge for 10 min at 1,300 x g, room temperature, and using a Pasteur pipette, transfer the upper phase containing the methylated fatty acids into a glass tube (disposable screw thread culture tube). This step must be performed under the fume hood.Repeat the hexane extraction on the aqueous bottom phase (step B6) and pool the second upper organic phase with the first one. This step must be performed under the fume hood.Dry the pooled hexane phases that contain the fatty acid methyl esters under a stream of N2 (0.5-1 psi). This step must be performed under the fume hood.The lipid film is resuspended in 10 μl hexane (in the fume hood), injected into a BPX70 gas chromatography column (SGE) and analyzed by gas chromatography using a flame ionization detector (Perkin Elmer).",
    "The used temperature program is 1) 7 min 30 sec at 130 °C, followed by 2) an increasing ramp of temperatures from 130 °C to 180 °C, with an increase of 3 °C per minute, and finally 10 min at 180 °C. The fatty acids are separated by the N2 mobile phase (3.5 ml/min) according to their size and solubility. They are quantified by comparison of their retention time with that of the C21:0 internal standard fatty acid that was added during the methanolysis step.Note: A 150 cm2 flask of confluent HeLa cells yields ~400-420 μg of glycerophospholipids. Formation of large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) by extrusionRehydrate a lipid film overnight at room temperature in 10 mM HEPES-150 mM NaCl (pH 7.4).Note: The lipids naturally organize themselves into MLVs of various diameters.To obtain a population of large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) of defined diameter (example: 100 nm) the solution is:Frozen in liquid N2.Vortexed.Thawed in a 37 °C water bath.Note: The steps C2a-C2c, which are repeated 3 times, begin the separation of the lipid layers.Passed through an extruder: forcing 20 times the passage of MLVs through the calibrated pores of a polycarbonate membrane maintained between two Hamilton syringes separates the lipid bilayers one from another and allows the formation of LUVs. The photo of a mini-extruder equipped with two Hamilton syringes can be seen on the following website: https://avantilipids.com/divisions/equipment/mini-extruder-extrusion-technique/[href=https://avantilipids.com/divisions/equipment/mini-extruder-extrusion-technique/.].Note: The LUV solution must be kept at 4 °C and be used for experiments within 2 days. Protein-lipid binding assayThe binding assay is performed at room temperature for 30 min, under mild agitation (rotating agitator): 6 μg of purified (recombinant) protein are incubated with LUVs formed from 150 μg of extracted lipids and extruded at 100 nm.Analysis of the incubation product by TEMA carbon rod (3.",
    "05 mm diameter) is carved with a pencil sharpener.The carbon rod is placed between the two electrodes of the carbon evaporator and the mica sheet is positioned at the center of the evaporator chamber.Once the vacuum in the chamber is reached, carbon is evaporated for 400 msec.2 μl of the incubation product is adsorbed on the clean side of a carbon film that had been pre-evaporated on a mica sheet.The carbon film is detached from the mica by floating it in a ceramic well (maximum volume: 200 μl) containing 100 to 150 μl of the negative stain solution (2% uranyl acetate solution) (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161010/20161010192722_9219.jpgFigure 2. Photo on how to float the carbon film into a well containing the negative stain solutionThe carbon film is picked up onto a 400 mesh copper grid using a small square of newspaper (Figure 3) and air dried.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161010/20161010192811_5628.jpgFigure 3. Photo illustrating how the copper grid covered by the carbon film is separated from the newspaper used to fish the grid from the wellThe grids are observed using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) such as a JEOL-1400 Plus (MET 120 kV) operating at 100 kV. Images are recorded at the nominal magnifications of 10,000x or 40,000x (see the section ‘Representative data’).Analysis of the incubation product by flotation across a discontinuous sucrose gradientThe protein-lipid incubation product is mixed with 160 μl of a 40% sucrose solution and deposited at the bottom of a 750 μl open tube.Using a P200 micropipette, the bottom fraction is covered stepwise by 110 μl fractions of each of the following sucrose solutions: 30%, 20%, 10%, 5%, 0%.Note: The sucrose solutions are prepared in the binding buffer.The gradient is ultracentrifuged for 16 h, at 100,000 x g, 4 °C in a MLS-50 Swinging-Bucket rotor using a TL100 ultracentrifuge.",
    "The photo of a discontinuous sucrose gradient (although used for other purposes) can be observed on the Bio-Protocol ‘Isolation of Growth Cones from Mouse Brain’ (http://www.bio-protocol.org/e853[href=http://www.bio-protocol.org/e853], Figure 2, left image).The sucrose fractions are collected from the top and analyzed byImmunoblot to detect the studied protein (see section G below)Iodin fumigation to reveal the glycerophospholipids (see section H below)Analysis of the proteins by immunoblot25 μl of each sucrose fraction (or 40 μl of the bottom sucrose fraction) are mixed with 5 μl of loading dye solution and loaded into an SDS-PAGE (percentage of polyacrylamide to be adjusted to the molecular weight of the studied protein, typically a 12% gel allows the resolution of proteins in the range of 15-250 kDa) (see http://www.bio-rad.com/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/Bulletin_6040.pdf[href=http://www.bio-rad.com/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/Bulletin_6040.pdf] and BioProtocol [Bio101] Laemmli-SDS-PAGE[href=http://www.bio-protocol.org/e80]).The proteins separated by SDS-PAGE are transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and further revealed using a specific antibody (standard immunoblot technique revealed by chemiluminescence [ECL]) (Figure 4A, lower panel).Revelation of the glycerophospholipids by iodin fumigation5 μl of each sucrose fraction are spotted onto a Thin Layer Chromatography plate: use a pencil to draw a line and separate the spots one from each other by 1 cm on the line.The plate is introduced into a tank (a photo of such a tank can be seen on the website[href=http://images.google.fr/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.capitolscientific.com%2Fcore%2Fmedia%2Fmedia.nl%253Fid%253D96999%2526c%253D1250437%2526h%253Dbd0e36b51d03d1012532&imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.capitolscientific.com%2FKONTES-416180-1020-Rectangular-Shorty-Thin-Layer-Chromatography-Developing-Tank-with-Lid-for-10-x&h=255&w=255&tbnid=2rkzc5Pia_YQ3M%3A&docid=2HrttSP8M4QktM&ei=lHNyV4WcKsiQaJmVk_AL&tbm=isch&client=firefox-b-ab&iact=rc&uact=3&dur=310&page=1&start=0&ndsp=12&ved=0ahUKEwiFtv6g4srNAhVICBoKHZnKBL4QMwggKAEwAQ&bih=481&biw=1089]) saturated in iodin fumes (iodin crystals introduced into the tank 30 min before the introduction of the plate into the tank): iodin binds to the double bounds of fatty acids and thus allows to reveal the glycerophospholipids present in each fraction (Figure 4A, upper panel)."
