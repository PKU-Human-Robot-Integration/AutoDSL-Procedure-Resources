    "Huh7 hepatoma cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin under a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C in 5% CO2.    Cells were passaged every three days. 2 x 106 of Huh7 cells were seeded in 10 cm dish, one day before the transfection.   Next day, cells were (co)-transfected using polyethylenimine (PEI).  PEI transfection method:    In a sterile tube, total 10 μg of plasmid DNA (5 μg of phosphoacceptor site mutant and 5 μg of P-deficient mutant) was mixed with 500 μl Opti-MEM.    Add 30 μl of PEI solution (1 μg/1 μl) to DNA-Opti-MEM solution and then vortex immediately.    Incubate 15 min at room temperature.   Then add PEI/DNA-Opti-MEM mixture to cells.     Transfection experiments were repeated at least three times.    Cytoplasmic core particles were prepared as previously described (Kim et al., 2004).  Three days after transfection, cells were used for core particle preparation. Cytoplasmic core particle preparations:   Discard medium and wash with 10 ml PBS.    Add PBS 1 ml, scrape the cells, and transfer to 1.5 ml tube.   Spin down at 13,000 rpm for 10 sec and discard supernatant.   Add 1 ml lysis buffer, vortex, and then incubate on ice for 10 min.   Spin down at 13,500 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C.   Transfer supernatant to fresh 1.5 ml tube.   Add micrococcal nuclease 1 μl (45 unit/μl), 1 M MgCl2 10 μl (final 10 mM), 1 M CaCl2 8 μl (final 8 mM).   Incubate 37 °C, 1 h.   Add 40% PEG 250 μl (26%), 5 M NaCl 100 μl (1.4 M), 0.5 M EDTA 118 μl (40 mM).   Put them in ice for 1 h.   Spin down at 13,500 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min.   Dissolve pellet in 20 μl nuclease free distilled water.",
    "To analyze HBV DNA synthesis by primer extension analysis, HBV DNA was extracted from isolated core particles (Kim et al., 2004). Prior to primer extension analysis, HBV DNA synthesis was analyzed by Southern blotting to see the levels of relaxed circular, double-stranded linear, and single-stranded DNAs (Jung et al., 2014) (Figure 1).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150805/20150805020814_5893.jpg Figure 1. HBV DNA synthesis in core particles formed by STSSSS (WT) and mutant C proteins. To examine HBV DNA synthesis in core particles formed by phosphoacceptor site mutant C proteins, phosphoacceptor site mutant and P-deficient mutant were co-transfected into Huh7 cells. HBV DNA was extracted from isolated core particles (Kim et al., 2004), and Southern blot analysis was performed (Jung et al., 2014). Replicative-intermediate DNAs, relaxed circular (RC), double-stranded linear (DL), and single-stranded (SS) DNAs, are indicated.     Oligonucleotide DNA primers were 5’-end–labeled with 30 μCi γ-32P-ATP at 37 °C for 3 h using T4 polynucleotide kinase.  Labeling method table:",

HBV DNA (total 20 μl) extracted from core particles isolated from co-transfected Huh7 cells in 10-cm dishes was divided into four batches (5 μl): One batch for Southern blotting and three batches for primer extensions to measure minus-strand, plus-strand, and circularized RC DNAs.

Dried gels were subjected to autoradiography (Figure 3), and relative levels of radioactivity were measured using the Fujifilm Image Gauge software, version 4.0."
