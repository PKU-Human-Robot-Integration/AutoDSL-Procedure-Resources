  "procedures": [
    "A mutant strain used for curli purification was S. enterica serovar Typhimurium 14028-3b ∆bcsA. This is a strain of wild-type S. Typhimurium 14028 that we engineered to produce more curli by introducing a csgD promoter mutation from S. enterica serovar Enteritidis 27655-3b (White and Surette, 2006). csgD encodes the master biofilm regulator in S. enterica and E. coli (Gerstel et al., 2003; Brombacher et al., 2006). The other modification was to introduce a single-gene knockout of bcsA (White et al., 2006), which encodes cellulose synthase, responsible for making cellulose polymers at the cell surface of S. enterica and E. coli biofilm cells (Zogaj et al., 2001; Solano et al., 2002). The presence of cellulose causes other substances to become trapped in the extracellular matrix during the purification process. Furthermore, because curli and cellulose are difficult to separate (White et al., 2003), these carbohydrates can represent a significant proportion of the final purified product. The use of a cellulose-negative ∆bcsA strain avoids purification of these unnecessary contaminants.The same procedure can be used to purify curli from strains of S. enterica or E. coli that produce cellulose; it is just important to note that cellulose will represent a proportion of the final weight of the “mature curli”. The tight association between curli and cellulose (White et al., 2003) will make it impossible to separate them.Mature Curli Extraction and PurificationBacterial Strain and culture condition Grow strain S. Typhimurium 14028-3b ∆bcsA in 5 mL of Luria broth (1% salt) overnight at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm.Dip sterile swabs in this overnight culture and spread evenly onto 120 large (150 mm × 15 mm) T agar plates to ensure that a homogenous lawn of bacteria covers the entirety of each plate.Incubate the inoculated plates at 28°C for 48 h.",
    "Mature curli extraction Collect the bacterial cells and extracellular material by scraping the agar surfaces using microscope slides (Video 1) or a sterile cell scraper.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Scraping Plates Suspend the cell materials from each set of 10 plates in 20 mL of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) supplemented with RNase A and DNase I (to 0.1 mg/mL final concentration).Vortex the suspended cell material until there are no visible clumps.Transfer 1 mL of cell slurry into 2 mL Safe-Lock tubes containing a 5 mm stainless steel bead (Qiagen) (approximately 20 tubes per 10 Petri plates).Place tubes in the mixer mill and homogenize at 30 Hz for 5 min in room temperature to break up the extracellular matrix.Transfer and combine the homogenized cell materials into 30 mL Oak Ridge centrifuge tubes.Lyse bacterial cells by sonication using the 3 mm probe with 10 × 30 s pulses at 30% amplitude with 2 min cooling on ice between pulses (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4419/bioprotoc-12-10-4419-g001.jpgFigure 1. Reference image of sonication apparatus used for bacterial cell lysis. Cells are suspended in a 30 mL Oak Ridge centrifuge tube, which is embedded in ice within a 500 mL beaker. The sonicator probe is placed within the centrifuge tube approximately 5 mm beneath the surface of the liquid cell slurry.After sonication, add 2 M MgCl2 to a final concentration of 1 mM and incubate the mixture at 37°C for 20 min without shaking.After incubation, add lysozyme to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL and incubate the mixture at 37°C for 40 min without shaking.Add SDS to a final concentration of 1%, along with 0.1 mg/mL DNase I, and incubate this mixture overnight at 37°C without shaking.The next day, centrifuge the mixture in 30 mL Oak Ridge centrifuge tubes at 25,000 × g and 4°C for 25 min.",
    "For each tube, remove supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 10 mL of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), boil for 10 min, and centrifuge the mixture at 25,000 × g for 25 min. Repeat this step twice.Resuspend the pellet with 10 mL of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) and add RNase A (0.1 mg/mL final conc.), DNase I (0.1 mg/mL final conc.) and Lysozyme (1 mg/mL final conc.) and incubate the mixture overnight at 37°C.Note: This step can be repeated several times, if the mixture is highly viscous (i.e., looks like a clump of mucus), without any reduction in amount or quality of the final, purified material. After the mixture has achieved a lower viscosity (i.e., becomes watery), centrifuge the mixture at 12,100 × g for 15 min.Wash the pellet twice with 10 mL of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) by centrifugation at 12,100 × g for 15 min. Reduced viscosity is necessary for this step to work efficiently and can slightly vary from batch to batch.Resuspend the pellet in 3 ml of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boil for 15 min (Crude protein sample).Mature Curli Purification in SDS-PAGE Gel. Prepare a 4 mm thick SDS-PAGE gel with 5% stacking gel and 12% separating gel (Figure 2A).Load 3 mL of Crude protein sample from step 16 (see above) into the well of preparative SDS-PAGE gel (Figure 2B) and run continuously at 100V until all the dye in the sample runs through the bottom (Figure 2C). Pack around the bottom of the electrophoresis apparatus with ice to prevent the gel from over-heating (Figure 2B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4419/bioprotoc-12-10-4419-g002.jpgFigure 2. SDS-PAGE gel apparatus for curli purification from bacterial cells. (A) Reference image of gel casting system. (B) Three milliliters of crude protein sample loaded into the well, prior to SDS-PAGE.",
    "Note: pack the SDS-PAGE gel apparatus with ice or run the experiment in a 4°C cold room to prevent gel overheating. (C) Electrophoresis is performed until the sample loading dye reaches the bottom.Collect the insoluble material retained on the top of the well (Figure 3; arrow) using a 5 mL syringe with 18-gauge needle. Purified curli fibers will not enter the SDS-PAGE gel unless they are depolymerized with 90% FA (Collinson et al. 1991) or 100% HFIP (Zhou et al., 2013).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4419/bioprotoc-12-10-4419-g003.jpgFigure 3. Collection of curli aggregates from the top of the gel after electrophoresis. The red arrow denotes the purified curli fibrils on the top of the well before collection. Using a syringe and an 18-gauge needle, the researcher can collect the white material from the top of the gel.Wash recovered insoluble material with 10 mL of sterile distilled water and sediment by centrifugation at 16,000 × g and 4°C for 10 min. Repeat this wash step three times.Dissolve the pellet with 5 ml of 95% ethanol and centrifuge at 16,000 × g and 4°C for 10 min. Repeat this step twice.Resuspend the pellet with 10 mL of sterile distilled water, transfer to suitable container (e.g., 30 mL Oakridge centrifuge tubes; Figure 4A), and freeze the mixture at -80°C.Wrap the frozen tubes with 1 ply kimwipes, secure them with rubber band, and lyophilize for 24 h. White, flocculent material should be present at the bottom of each tube (Figure 4B).Note: Tubes can be either wrapped with 1 ply kimwipes or with aluminum foil. If the tubes are wrapped with aluminum foil, make few holes for the proper lyophilization of frozen material. These holes allow the change of frozen material from solid to vapor state. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4419/bioprotoc-12-10-4419-g004.jpgFigure 4. Lyophilization of purified curli aggregates.",
    "(A) The solution of purified curli in water was frozen at -80°C in 30 mL Oakridge centrifuge tubes, wrapped with lint free tissue, and lyophilized for 24 h. (B) White, flocculent material (red arrow) present in the bottom of each tube after lyophilization represents curli fibrils.Dissolve the lyophilized material in 2 mL of 0.2 M glycine (pH 1.5) and boil this mixture for 10 min to solubilize any Type I fimbriae that might be present (Müller et al., 1991).Centrifuge the sample at 27,500 × g for 25 min.Wash the pellets five times with sterile distilled water with centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 25 min.Resuspend the pellet with 5 mL of distilled water and transfer the mixture into a pre-weighed glass vial.Freeze the mixture at -80°C and lyophilize for 24 h.After lyophilization, weigh the glass vial containing sample to obtain the rough sample weight. The final purified material (Figure 5) should be white to off-white in color and “more powdery” than the material described in step 6.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4419/bioprotoc-12-10-4419-g005.jpgFigure 5. Quantitation and long-term storage of purified curli. All material collected after the final lyophilization step was transferred into pre-weighed, sterile glass vials, and the rough weight was calculated. This purified material can be stored at -20°C.Store the lyophilized material (Curli standard) at -20°C. Stock solutions are best prepared by weighing out a desired amount of purified curli into a glass vial, and resuspending in distilled water to achieve the desired concentration, such as 1 mg/mL. Once a stock solution is prepared, aliquot the mixture into Eppendorf tubes. Because purified curli fibers are insoluble in water, make sure to evenly mix the stock solution and use a wide-bore pipette to transfer the aliquot.To prepare depolymerized curli, add 90% FA or 100% HFIP to the mature curli (purified curli from step 13).",
    "Note: HFIP and FA are irritating and corrosive chemicals. Always use them under a chemical fume hood and wear appropriate protective equipment while handling. Store them in a well-ventilated, cool place. For HFIP treatment, weigh 1 mg of curli, dissolve it in 1 mL of HFIP, and aliquot them into 0.5 mL Eppendorf tubes. For FA treatment, prepare 1 mg/mL of curli in sterile water, aliquot 10 µL of stock into 0.5 mL Eppendorf tubes, and add 92 µL of FA.Immediately freeze the mixtures for 1 h at -80°C, make a hole in the lids (i.e., using a sterile needle), and lyophilize for 24 h.Note: Samples containing acid may damage some lyophilizers. After lyophilization, dissolve mature (from step 13) and FA/HFIP-treated or depolymerized curli (from step 15–16) with 30 µl of 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and load them into each SDS-PAGE gel lane.Check the purity of mature and depolymerized curli by immunoblot analysis (Figure 6A and 6C).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4419/bioprotoc-12-10-4419-g006.jpgFigure 6. Comparison of different forms of curli as detected by immunoblot analysis. (A and B) Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE consisting of a 5% acrylamide stacking gel and 12% acrylamide resolving gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using the iBlot system. For all immunoblots, monomer (M), dimer (D), and higher molecular weight oligomers of CsgA were detected using rabbit anti-curli polyclonal serum, followed by IRDye 680RD goat anti-rabbit IgG and detection using the Odyssey CLx imaging system (Li-Cor Biosciences). (A) 20 µg and 10 µg of purified curli were depolymerized with 90% FA prior to SDS-PAGE. (B) 50 mg samples of homogenized tissues from mice infected with S. Typhimurium were treated three successive times with 90% FA prior to SDS-PAGE, as previously described (Miller et al., 2020).",
    "(C) 10 µg of purified full-length curli (Mature), curli intermediates (Interm) and FA or HFIP treated curli were loaded and resolved directly on pre-cast NovexTM 4–12% Tris-Glycine Mini Gels. The white star denotes the 25 kDa protein standard.Purification of Curli IntermediatesPurification of curli intermediates relies on generating a ∆msbB mutant strain (Nicastro et al., 2019).Studies on human amyloids have proved that different types of intermediate structures formed during the multistep process of amyloid polymerization. Wherein, soluble human amyloid monomers first form oligomers, which then polymerize into protofibrillar structures and then cross-assemble them into a stable, mature fibrils. Even though the process of curli fibrillar assembly in Enterobacteriaceae has been well-studied, the intermediate oligomeric structures of curli have not been identified or studied until recently by Nicastro et al. (2019). The authors have used the ∆msbB strain to understand the fibrillization kinetics of curli, their intermediates, as well as the role of mature curli fibrillar aggregates in the assembly of bacterial extracellular Matrix. The ∆msbB gene in Salmonella encodes the enzyme that catalyzes one of the two secondary acylation reactions that completes lipid A biosynthesis. It synthesizes a full-length O-antigen-containing LPS molecule that lacks only the expected secondary acyl chain, and is less able to induce cytokine and inducible nitric oxide synthase responses in both in vitro and in vivo conditions. They found that intermediate protofibrillar structures of bacterial amyloid (Curli intermediates) are more cytotoxic, and the addition of bacterial DNA accelerates them to form a mature fibrillar structure, limiting cytotoxic effects. The more detailed information regarding the kinetics of curli fibrilization and its stability can be found elsewhere (Nicastro et al., 2019). We used the lambda red recombinase knockout procedure (Datsenko and Wanner, 2000) to generate S. Typhimurium 14028s ∆msbB.",
    "Our first attempts to generate the ∆msbB strain were unsuccessful because we had difficulties recovering the antibiotic resistant transformants on LB agar. It has been reported that a Salmonella msbB mutant strain shows poor growth on LB agar and that growth can be restored to near wild-type levels by switching to MSB agar (LB with no NaCl supplemented with Mg2+ and Ca2+) (Murray et al., 2001). Once the procedure was changed to recover CMR (Chloramphenicol-resistant) transformants on MSB agar instead of LB agar, the lambda red procedure worked efficiently.Grow strain S. Typhimurium 14028s ∆msbB in 5 mL of MSB broth with 34 µg/mL chloramphenicol overnight at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm.Add 5 mL of overnight culture to 500 mL of YESCA broth supplemented with 4% DMSO in a 1-L flask and incubate at 26°C for 72 h with shaking at 200 rpm.After incubation, collect bacterial pellet by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min.Resuspend the pellet in 30 mL of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and treat with RNase A (0.1 mg/mL final conc.), DNase I (0.1 mg/mL final conc.), and MgCl2 (1 mM final conc.) for 30 min at 37°C.After enzyme treatment, sonicate the suspension to break open the bacteria with 3 × 30 s pulses at 30% amplitude with 1 min cooling on ice between pulses.To the mixture, add lysozyme to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL and incubate for 40 min at 37°C.Add SDS to a final concentration of 1% to the mixture and incubate for 20 min at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm.After incubation, pellet curli by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C).Resuspend the curli pellet in 10 mL of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and boil for 10 min.",
    "Cool down the sample on ice before adding RNase A (0.1 mg/mL final conc.), DNase I (0.1 mg/mL final conc.), lysozyme (1 mg/mL final conc.) and MgCl2 (1 mM final conc.). Incubate this mixture at 37°C for 2 h. Repeat this step until the desired viscosity is reached (see section A steps 13 and 14).Centrifuge the mixture at 10,000 × g and 4°C for 10 min.Wash the pellet three times with 10 mL 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and resuspend in 3 mL of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boil for 10 min.Load the 3 mL of crude protein sample (from previous step) into a 4 mm-thick SDS-PAGE gel with 5% stacking gel and 12% separating gel and run continuously at 100 V until all the dye in the sample has run through the bottom.After electrophoresis, use a 5 mL syringe with 18-gauge needle to collect the curli aggregates from the top of the gel, resuspend in 5–10 mL of sterile water, pellet by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min) and wash two times with sterile water.Resuspend the curli in 5 mL of 95% ethanol, pellet by centrifugation at 13,500 × g for 10 min, and wash two more times with ethanol.Resuspend the curli in sterile water and transfer the mixture into a pre-weighed glass vial.Freeze the mixture at -80°C and lyophilize for 24 h.After lyophilization, weigh the glass vial containing sample to obtain the rough sample weight and store the lyophilized material at -20°C. The purity of curli intermediates can be checked by immunoblot analysis (Figure 6C).Curli detection in host tissues/samplesThe procedure for analysis of mouse tissues was adapted from Miller et al. (2020). The same procedure could be used to analyze tissues from other animal species or for other types of samples.Place tissue samples (i.e.",
    ", liver, cecum, colon, and small intestine) in tinfoil packets, snap freeze in liquid nitrogen, and store at -80°C.Pre-chill a mortar and pestle by storing at -20°C. Grind the frozen tissue samples into a fine powder under liquid nitrogen. The powdered samples can be scraped out of the mortar and pestle using a metal spatula onto weigh paper and transferred in 2 mL screwcap freezer vials, and stored at -80°C.Weigh 50 mg samples of powdered tissue, transfer into Eppendorf tubes and resuspend in 500 μL of 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boil for 10 min. This step will dissolve most of the soluble cellular proteins.Cool down the solution on ice, and pellet the cell debris by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 5 min.Resuspend the pellet in 500 μL of sterile distilled water and centrifuge at 25,000 × g for 5 min. Repeat this step twice. This washes away any remaining residues of SDS-PAGE sample buffer.Resuspend the pellet with 500 μL of 90% FA and freeze the sample at -80°C for at least 1 h.Lyophilize the mixture for 16–24 h. Repeat steps 6 and 7 three times. For purified curli standards, FA treatment only needs to be performed once.Note: Samples containing acid may damage some lyophilizers. After FA treatment, resuspend the lyophilized samples in 50 μL of 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and centrifuge the samples at 25,000 × g for 2 min.Note: Do not boil the samples, because it will cause the curli monomers to aggregate. Load a 20 μL aliquot of supernatant into each SDS-PAGE gel lane. We have used self-prepared 5% acrylamide stacking and 12% acrylamide resolving gels or commercial 4–12% acrylamide gradient gels. Load at least one gel lane with a commercial prestained protein ladder.Perform electrophoresis at 110 V.",
    "Carefully remove and place the gel on the nitrocellulose membrane and perform protein transfer for 40 min at 25V in Trans-Blot SD semi-dry transfer cell. Alternatively, proteins can be transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using the automated iBlot system.Detect curli proteins present in the tissue samples using any standard immunoblotting procedure. We commonly use rabbit anti-curli polyclonal serum as the primary antibody at 1:500 dilution in 5% skim milk in TBST and incubate at 4°C overnight or at 37°C for one hour. The secondary antibody used is either IRDye 680RD goat anti-rabbit IgG at 1:10,000 dilution (for fluorescent applications) or Goat-anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate at 1:2,000 dilution in 5% skim milk in TBST. The incubation is for 1 h 30 min at room temperature in the dark for fluorescence or 1 h at 37°C on a tilted platform shaker for colorimetric detection.Antibody binding is visualized using fluorescence with the Odyssey CLX imaging system and Image Studio 4.0 software package (Figure 6B). For colorimetric detection of curli, soluble BCIP/NBT are used as substrates. Alkaline phosphatase will produce a stable blue-purple product that will not fade upon exposure to light, and you do not need special equipment to visualize.DNA extraction from curliPrevious work from the Tükel lab has shown that extracellular DNA (eDNA) associates with curli fibrils during the development of the mature biofilm and purified curli contains eDNA (Gallo et al., 2015). Since the presence of eDNA can influence immune recognition as well as TLR2/9 stimulation (Tursi and Tükel, 2018), it is good practice to determine just how much eDNA is associated with purified curli each time a batch is purified.Resuspend 500 μg of purified curli in 550 μL of TE buffer, 30 μL of 10% SDS, and 70 μL of proteinase K (20 mg/mL).",
    "Mix thoroughly and incubate at 37°C for 1 h.Add 100 μL of 5 M NaCl and mix by pipetting.Add 80 μL of CTAB/NaCl solution and mix thoroughly by pipetting using wide bore tips.Incubate at 37°C for 10 min.Add 300–400 μL phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol to samples and mix by inverting the tubesCentrifuge at 15,682 × g and 4°C for 5 min.Transfer upper phase to a new Eppendorf tube.Add 700 μL of chloroform and mix by pipetting.Centrifuge at 15,682 × g and 4°C for 5 min.Transfer upper phase to a new Eppendorf tube and add equal volume isopropanol and shake the tube by hand.Incubate at -20°C for 30 min.Centrifuge at 13,362 × g and 4°C for 5 min.Discard the liquid and rinse the DNA pellet with 1 mL of 70% EtOH and centrifuge for 5 min at 5,220 × g.Resuspend the final DNA pellet in 30 μL of TE buffer or water.Measure the DNA content using a DeNovix DS-11 FX spectrophotomer/fluorometer."
