(Alternatively, a strainer can be placed in a 50 mL Falcon tube for processing).\nUsing the syringe plunger from a 5 mL syringe, gently force the spleen through the cell strainer.\nUsing a P1000 pipette add 1 mL 10% FBS RPMI buffer to wash the strainer.\nFilter the splenocyte solution back through the strainer by taking from suspension in the petri dish and pipetting back onto the strainer. Repeat this 8–10 times using P1000 pipette until suspension is homogenous.\nPool the splenocyte suspension by transferring it into a 15 mL Falcon tube.\nWash strainer with 1 mL 10% FBS RMPI and transfer this to the 15 mL Falcon tube.\nCentrifuge Falcon tube at 500 × g for 5 min at 15°C–20°C.\nDecant supernatant and proceed to perform red blood cell lysis by resuspending the cell pellet in 1 mL of RBC lysis buffer.\nIncubate for 2 min on ice.",
    "Top up the 15 mL Falcon tube with 9 mL 10% FBS RPMI and centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at 15°C–20°C.\nDecant supernatant and resuspend cell pellet at cell concentration of 5 million/mL in 10% FBS RPMI and keep cells on ice.\nCulture setup\nTiming: 0–4 h\nThis part established how to modulate the TCR signal length in splenocyte cultures from Nr4a1-GFP Nr4a3-Tocky mice.\nOptional: Cultures are set up on 96 well round bottom plates (Corning) in a final volume of 190 μL, with 10 μL volume used to add the PP2 inhibitor, however depending on cell numbers and desired interactions other plate formats may also be suitable.\nNote: PP2 is reconstituted in sterile DMSO to a master stock concentration of 20 mM.\nPrepare master mixes of anti-CD3 and PP2, a src-kinase family inhibitor which will pharmacologically terminate TCR signaling in culture.\n20 μg/mL anti-CD3, (pre-warmed to 37°C).\n200 μm PP2 (keep on ice).\nPipette 100 μL of splenocyte suspension which is at 5 million/mL into 8 wells of 96 well round bottom plate. For this experiment there are 8 conditions representing 0, 2.5, 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min of TCR stimulation.\nAdd 40 μL of 10% FBS RPMI to each well.\nSpin plate for 1 min at 100 × g to settle cells to bottom of plate.\nPlace plate in incubator for 30 min to equilibrate at 37°C.\nRemove plate and add 50 μL of 20 μg/mL anti-CD3 stock (final concentration 5 μg/mL) to wells.\nAdd 10 μL of 200 μM PP2 to 0-min stimulation (gives final concentration 10 μM).\nPlace plate in incubator with 5% CO2 and 37°C and start timer.",
    "At 2.5-, 5-, 15-, 30-, 60-, 120-min remove plate and add 10 μL of 200 μM PP2 inhibitor. Place plate back in incubator until 240 min has expired.\nNote: During incubation, the staining mix can be prepared (see below).\nAfter 240 min proceed immediately to staining.\nStaining for flow cytometric analysis\nTiming: 0.5–1 h\nCentrifuge culture plate at 500 × g for 3 min, flick plate to decant supernatant and while still inverted blot against paper towel.\nAdd 25 μL of staining mix prepared as below in 2% FBS PBS (v/v). In our hands viability dye staining can be performed simultaneously with surface staining without adversely affecting performance.\nNote: Include single color compensation controls in addition to GFP, Timer-Blue, and Timer-Red.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_420_6.csv\nIncubate for 20 min at 4°C.\nAdd 180 μL of wash buffer to each well and centrifuge plate at 500 × g for 3 min, flick plate to decant supernatant and while still inverted blot against paper towel.\nResuspend pellet in 150 μL 2% FBS PBS and transfer to 5 mL FACS tube (BD Biosciences). Wash well with 150 μL 2% FBS PBS and transfer to FACS tube to make 300 μL final volume.\nPlace on ice in the dark and acquire samples on the flow cytometer within 2 h of staining.\nCritical: Cells should be analyzed as soon as possible following staining. In our hands, slow maturation of Blue to Red can occur after prolonged periods (e.g., overnight) at 4°C."
