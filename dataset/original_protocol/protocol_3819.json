    "Perform plasmid maxipreps using a commercially available kit to obtain enough plasmids (>100 μg) for following AAV preparation. We use TIANGEN HighPure Maxi Plasmid Kit (DP116) following the manufacturer’s instructions (http://www.tiangen.com.cn/asset/imsupload/up0004885001433129475.pdf[href=http://www.tiangen.com.cn/asset/imsupload/up0004885001433129475.pdf]).\nAAV production\nTiming: 4–5 days\nAAV8 is one of the most widely used AAV serotypes for in vivo gene delivery. Efficient transduction to the liver by a single tail vein injection has been well demonstrated(Sands, 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Outstanding liver tropism of AAV8 combined with a hepatocyte-specific promoter can specifically introduce Cre recombinase in hepatocytes of the spCas9 KI mouse. In this section, we will describe how to produce AAV in a step by step manner.\nHEK293T cells are cultured in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Pen/strep. 20–24 h before transfection, five 15 cm plates of cells with 80%–90% confluency are split to ten 15 cm plates such that the cells will reach ∼80% confluency the next day.\nPrepare transfection mixture: add the plasmid DNA as shown below into 49 mL of serum-free, antibiotic-free DMEM. Mix well, then add 1360 μL of 1 mg/mL PEI (assume the ratio of DNA: PEI is 1:4). Mix immediately. Incubate the mixture at 20°C–25°C for 15 min.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_737_12.csv\nCritical: The ratio of DNA: PEI needs to be tested for each batch of PEI.\nAdd 5 mL of transfection mixture to each 15 cm plate in a drop by drop fashion.\nAbout 14 h after transfection, change the media with DMEM supplemented with 1% Pen/strep.\nNote: FBS could be omitted in this step without lowering virus yield.\nAfter 60 h after transfection, scrape and transfer the cells with medium to several 50 mL tubes. Spin at 200 × g for 10 min and discard the supernatant.",
    "Re-suspend and combine the cell pellets by 20 mL of PBS. Spin at 200 × g for 10 min and discard the supernatant.\nRe-suspend the cell pellet by 5 mL of AAV lysis buffer.\nPause Point: The cell suspension can be stored at −80°C.\nFreeze-thaw the cells three times between liquid nitrogen and water bath (37°C) to lyse the cells.\nNote: Make sure to freeze and thaw the cells completely.\nAdd 5 μL of 1 M MgCl2 and 5 μL of 25 kU/mL Benzonase to the cell lysate. Mix well and incubate at 37°C for 15 min.\nSpin at 3200 × g for 30 min at 4°C. Carefully transfer the supernatant (lysate) which contains the virus to a new 15 mL tube.\nPrepare iodixanol gradient solution as shown in KRT.\nPrepare a discontinuous 17%-25%-40%-60% gradient in a 33 mL Optiseal tube (Beckman). Add from the bottom first 6 mL of the 17% iodixanol solution, then underlay 6 mL of the 25% iodixanol solution, then 5 mL of the 40% iodixanol solution and then 4 mL of the 60% iodixanol solution (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). Mark the interface between the 60% layer and 40% layer. (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B)\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/737-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "Transfer the lysate on the top layer gently and fill up the tube by AAV lysis buffer until the liquid level reaches the neck of the tube.\nCentrifuge for 2 h 40 min at 289, 100 × g (Type 70Ti) at 14°C.\nHarvest viral fraction (40% fraction): use a 10 mL syringe and insert the needle at the interface between 60% layer and 40% layer which has been marked before centrifugation (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C). The total volume collected is 3.5–4 mL.\nCritical: Bubbles should be avoided in step 16 and step 19.\nCritical: The volume of collected viral fraction should be no more than 4 mL. Contamination of 25% fraction will cause AAV impurity.\nEquilibrate the 100K Centrifugal filter (Millipore, Amacon 100k-UFC 910096): add 5 mL of 1× PBS containing 0.01% F188, and centrifuge at 2500 × g for 5 min.\nTransfer the viral fraction into the 100K Centrifugal filter and fill with 1× PBS containing 0.01% F188. Mix well and centrifuge at 2500 × g for 20 min. Discard the flow through and fill the column with 1× PBS containing 0.01% F188 again. Repeat spin and add PBS for 3 times.\nConcentrate the virus to about 500–1000 μL. Determine the purity of the virus by SDS-PAGE gel (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D). Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nPrepare standards using pX602-Cre-sgRNA. Make serial 10-fold dilutions of the 1 μg/mL stock to get 1 μg/mL, 10−1 μg/mL, 10−2 μg/mL, 10−3 μg/mL and 10−4 μg/mL standards. Calculate the vector genomes (Vg) of your standards according to the following formula:",
    "Vg / ml =   6.02 ×  10 23  × 2   L e n g t h  o f  t h e  v e c t o r   ( b p )  × 6.6 ×    10 8  μ g   m o l × b p     × C o n c e n t r a t i o n  ( μ g / m l )   \nLength of pX602-Cre-sgRNA: 5036 bp\nSo the vector genome concentration of the standards are 3.6×1011Vg/mL, 3.6×1010Vg/mL, 3.6×109Vg/mL, 3.6×108Vg/mL and 3.6×107Vg/mL respectively.\nExtract genome DNA from the virus.

Then add the following components\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_737_14.csv\nMix well and incubate at 37°C for 15 min, followed by at 95°C for 10 min.\nNote: this step will dilute the virus 20-fold.\nSet up the qPCR reaction as shown below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_737_15.csv\nRun the qPCR reaction using the following thermocycler program.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_737_16.csv\nAnalyze the qPCR data to get a calibration curve. Calculate the AAV titer in vector genomes per mL (Vg/mL) as described in “quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis]”. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nAdjust the concentration of AAV to 4 × 1012 Vg/mL by PBS.\nViral injection\nTiming: 2 weeks or longer\nInject 6- to 8-week-old male spCas9 KI mice with AAV-Cre-sgRNA via lateral tail vein injection. We recommend administering AAV at 4 × 1011 total genome copies to each mouse (100 μL of 4 × 1012 Vg/mL stock) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/737-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

    "(A) Sanger sequencing results of regions around the guide sequence. Primary hepatocytes isolated from spCas9 KI mice receiving AAV8-Cre-LacZ sgRNA or AAV8-Cre-Surf4 sgRNA are subjected to DNA extraction followed by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing. The guide sequence is underlined by the black line. The PAM sequence is underlined by the red dashed line.

Detection of protein levels is necessary with specific antibodies against proteins produced by GOI (in the case of SURF4, a home-made antibody is used, Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D). In some cases, this procedure is limited by the lack of specific antibodies, so we also describe a semi-quantitative method for validating gene editing on the genomic level which relies on Sanger sequencing and data analysis by software ICE.\nIsolate primary hepatocytes from control mice (injected with AAV-Cre-control sgRNA) and experimental mice (injected with AAV-Cre-GOI sgRNA). Please refer to (Charni-Natan and Goldstein, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) for step-by-step instructions.",
    "Optional: Sacrifice the mice by decapitation via the ethical and approved method and collect the livers. However, non-parenchymal cells make up 30%–40% of total cell population in the liver, so that using liver samples will underestimate the knockout efficiency (Seo and Jeong, 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nPause Point: Hepatocytes or tissues can be snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.\nExtract genomic DNA using QIANamp Genomic DNA (DP304-03) kit following manufacturer’s instructions (http://tiangen.com/asset/imsupload/up0875005001348194139.pdf[href=http://tiangen.com/asset/imsupload/up0875005001348194139.pdf]).\nDesign PCR primers to amplify 400 to 600 bp amplicons containing the sgRNA targeted region.\nPerform PCR using KOD-Plus-Neo kit.
