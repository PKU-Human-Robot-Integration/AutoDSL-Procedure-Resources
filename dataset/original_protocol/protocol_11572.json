    "Ethics Statement. When used in research, informed consent and/or assent from children is always required before collecting ultrasound images. When used clinically, clients should be informed of the purpose of the ultrasound imaging. Although diagnostic ultrasound imaging is considered \"minimal risk\" 30, users should always follow the ALARA principle when using ultrasound, meaning exposure to ultrasound should be as \"As Low As Reasonably Achievable\"31. This involves limiting acoustic power during imaging and also limiting exposure time. For example, if ultrasound is being used for visual feedback but the participant is not attending to the visual feedback, it would be prudent to discontinue imaging.\n1. Collecting Ultrasound Images of the Tongue\nNOTE: Technical Considerations. Diagnostic ultrasound probes are used to image the tongue. A frequency range between approximately 3 - 8 MHz with a frame rate of about 30 frames per second is recommended for clinical imaging the tongue 32.\nNOTE: The instructions below apply to the diagnostic Ultrasound System (see Materials Table) with a C6-2 transducer, which was selected based on visual comparison of ultrasound images collected from several transducers available for this system. These instructions are adapted from the diagnostic ultrasound system reference manual for this device and are intended to be an illustrative example for one ultrasound. Many other ultrasound systems are in use, and users should consult the operating manuals of their specific device.\nTurn on the machine. When powered on, observe the 2D imaging mode automatically displayed on the screen.\n\t\nWait for the system to complete self-diagnostic and calibration tests.",
    "NOTE: The automatically displayed image can be adjusted to optimize the clinician's view by altering the settings of the instrument. Because the use of ultrasound for speech therapy is new, settings appropriate for imaging the tongue surface during speech are not typically preinstalled and must be installed by a representative from the manufacturer (preferred method), or by the clinician. It is important to have the right settings in order to safely and accurately image the tongue for speech therapy purposes.\n\t\tNOTE: Users should familiarize themselves with the basic operations of their ultrasound equipment be sure they understand how to make adjustments of all controls including depth, intensity and contrast to obtain the best images with their equipment. Power should be set as low as reasonably achievable for safety reasons, with adjustments in Gain to compensate for low power settings.\nTo use system preset function, press the PRESETS key on the keyboard.\nObserve the Presets screen. Observe the menu items on the left and selections on the right of the screen.\nRoll the trackball to the menu item on the left of the screen and press the SET key on the control panel. Observe more selections for the selected menu item.\nTo save changes and exit the system presets, press the SAVE button at the bottom of the screen.\n\t\tNOTE: Table 1 shows the settings used for images in the video. Note that depth is transducer-dependent. Settings were developed in consultation with Siemens Corporation.\nPlace a small amount of ultrasound gel on the ultrasound transducer.\nPosition the participant comfortably in a chair with feet on the floor, back straight, and chin slightly forward.",
    "To collect a sagittal image and visualize the tongue from tip to root, position the transducer vertically, making tight contact with the skin underneath the chin and applying a firm but not uncomfortable degree of pressure. Orient the transducer along the midline between the mental spine of the mandible and the hyoid bone.\nBegin scanning with the ultrasound.\nView the screen to verify that the transducer is properly oriented. In these sagittal images, the front of the tongue is on the right of the screen and the back of the tongue is on the left. Angle the ultrasound transducer slightly forward or slightly back depending on what part of the tongue is of interest.\n\tNOTE: In some devices, the default settings will display an ultrasound image that is upside down. The user should check the default settings for their device and make adjustments as necessary.\nInstruct the participant to swallow to orient the user to the tongue position relative to the palate.\nObtain a coronal view to image the tongue from left to right sides. To collect coronal images, rotate the ultrasound transducer 90 degrees. Instruct the participant to sustain sounds requiring midline grooving of the tongue such as /r, s, z, ʃ/.It may be necessary to adjust the transducer slightly further forward or back to visualize tongue grooving for different sounds.\nOnce imaging is complete, wipe off excess gel and clean the transducer with ultrasound-approved disinfecting wipes or ultrasound-approved cleansing spray.\n2. Interpreting Ultrasound Images of the Tongue\nBasic interpretation of sagittal images\nIn a sagittal view, observe the tongue between two major shadows created by bone, which is opaque to ultrasound: the shadow of the mandible (anterior) and the shadow of the hyoid (posterior). At least one, and preferably both, of these landmarks are visible during tongue imaging.",
    "NOTE: If there is air below the tongue tip (as is typically the case when the tongue tip is extended), the extreme end of the tongue tip will not be visible on the ultrasound image.\nInstruct the participant to produce alveolar and velar sounds, such as /t d n/ then /k g/. This will help orient both the participant and the clinician to which side of the image is anterior/tongue tip and which side is posterior/tongue dorsum.\nCorrect /r/ production\nInstruct the participant to produce and sustain /r/. In a sagittal view of a correct production of /r/, the anterior portion of the tongue will elevate. The back part of the tongue dorsum slopes backwards for a correct /r/ production. Observe that if the probe is off midline or has rotated, the image will change and may be uninterpretable.\n\t\tNOTE: If the production is a \"retroflex\" /r/, then the tongue tip is raised toward the hard palate and the image of the tongue tip may be lost or may be represented as an artefact (e.g., tongue tip appears to raise through the palate). In a classically \"bunched\" /r/, the tongue tip and/or blade are either horizontal or angled down toward the floor of the oral cavity, but the anterior portion of the tongue dorsum will be raised. In both cases, the elevated portion of the tongue is narrowing the airspace between the tongue and the palate-that is, it is making a vocal tract constriction. The location of this constriction gives English /r/ its primary palatal place of articulation.\nWhile the participant is sustaining /r/, visualize the tongue root.",
    "NOTE: Depending on the particular type of ultrasound probe being used, this may require angling the probe back toward the hyoid. Perceptually accurate English /r/ requires a secondary constriction in the vocal tract caused by the retraction of the tongue root toward the back pharyngeal wall. The posterior pharyngeal wall cannot typically be visualized with ultrasound, but retraction can be inferred: if the tongue root is retracted, the slope of the tongue surface behind the anterior constriction will be shallow.\nRotate the probe 90 degrees to obtain a coronal view. Position the probe in the rough vicinity of the highest point of the tongue-about 1/3 of the distance between the chin and the throat in the sagittal plane.\n\t\tNOTE: While the participant is sustaining /r/, some elevation of the lateral margins of the tongue is generally visible. Although the teeth are not visible, it is common for individuals making a bunched type of /r/ to feel some contact with the back molars.\nAssessing distorted /r/ production with ultrasound\nInstruct the participant to imitate and sustain /r/.\n\t\tNOTE: In a sagittal view of a distorted production of /r/, the anterior aspect of the tongue is typically low, the tongue dorsum usually is raised high and back. Tongue root retraction is often absent, which is often indicated by a steep or nearly vertical slope of the tongue shape behind the anterior constriction.\nInstruct the participant to imitate /r/ in a number of syllables, such as /ɝ, ɑr, ɪr, rɑ, ri, ru/. Note any contexts that are perceptually correct and identify tongue shapes that are associated with correct vs. incorrect productions.\n\t\tNOTE: Dialect differences will influence articulation; these examples are for American English.",
    "Rotate the probe 90 degrees to obtain a coronal view and observe the lateral margins of the tongue. Repeat productions of syllables such as /ɝ, ɑr, ɪr, rɑ, ri, ru/. While the participant is sustaining a distorted /r/, the lateral margins of the tongue often remain low on one or both sides.\n3. Using Real-time Ultrasound Images for Feedback to Remediate Speech Sound Errors\nInstruct the participant on proper positioning of the ultrasound. Allow the participant to hold the ultrasound transducer if they are able. Alternatively, have the clinical researcher hold the transducer, or clamp the transducer to a microphone stand to keep it steady while the participant leans forward and rests the chin on it, maintaining firm pressure.\n\tNOTE: There may be a tendency for the probe to slide around. The clinician should be alert to correct movement of the probe to either side of the midsagittal plane, as the image becomes less consistent and harder to interpret.\nOrient the participant to ultrasound images in sagittal section by teaching them about the parts of the tongue. The participant should be able to trace sample tongue contours on a sagittal ultrasound image. Instruct the participant that /r/ requires both an oral constriction in the front and a pharyngeal constriction in the back.\n\tNOTE: It is often helpful to instruct the participant to identify the tip, blade, dorsum and root separately, as these correspond to independently moveable areas of the tongue.\nRequest that the participant point to the side of a real-time ultrasound image that represents the anterior and posterior, or \"front of the tongue\" and \"back of the tongue.\"",
    "Introduce the participant to different tongue shapes for /r/ using drawings, ultrasound images, or magnetic resonance images33. Make it clear where the oral and pharyngeal constrictions are, but also acknowledge that every tongue shape is slightly different.\n\tNOTE: See 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 for interpreting images from correct /r/ production\nRequest that the participant describe 2 major constrictions for /r/ that are visible in sagittal section. If the participant cannot identify the oral and pharyngeal constrictions just described, continue to instruct.\n\tNOTE: Participants should be able to report what is described in 3.4, indicating that some portion of the front of the tongue raises up, and that the tongue root moves back (as described in 2.2.1 and 2.2.2)\nOrient the participant to ultrasound images in coronal section. Instruct the participant in the desired tongue shape from left to right. Require that the participant trace the tongue shape, identify the left and right edges, and center line groove. Request that the participant explain the desired shape.\nAttempt to elicit correct /r/ in isolation or in syllables by providing phonetic cues to copy different tongue shapes.\n\tNOTE: It can be helpful to provide \"targets\" on the screen for the participant to match during /r/ production. Targets can be generated using a cursor or by drawing on a transparency placed over the screen. Provide explicit instructions such as \"If the tongue line doesn't match the red target, try doing something differently. Change the way one is saying the sound. Focus on making the dorsum go down,\" etc. See Supplement 1 for examples of Articulator Placement Cues.\nHave the participant provide an explanation of what they did correctly or incorrectly after some of their attempts.",
    "If necessary, use standard shaping strategies such as shaping /l/ to /r/ or /ɑ/ to /r/ while viewing the visual feedback.\nAfter achieving correct productions, press the Pause button to freeze the image. Discuss how the correct image looks different from previous incorrect productions.\nPractice throughout the session without the ultrasound to provide a break and to offer the opportunity for generalization to speech when visual feedback is not available.\n\tNOTE: As the participant achieves more accurate productions, increase the linguistic complexity from syllables to words, phrases, and sentences, and reduce the amount of feedback to facilitate generalization.\n\tNOTE: Accuracy of speech targets should be regularly monitored. This can be done perceptually by individuals (preferably who are blind to treatment status) who rate recordings of the sounds that are being trained with the ultrasound.\nSubscription Required.
