A UV-vis spectrophotometer\n      system is required in this section (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\n    \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2889-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Please make sure you are qualified to operate it.\n    \nNote: If the signal peak of the solvent",
    "D2O is much larger than signal peak of target compounds,\n      suppress the signal peak of the solvent D2O.\n    \nOptional: A detailed chemical\n      structure of self-assembly can be obtained from 2D-NMR, such as\n      correlation spectroscopy (COSY) and rotating-frame Overhauser effect\n      spectroscopy (ROESY). (Ma et al.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3])\n    \n        All the NMR data in .fid files are imported into MestReNova to determine\n        the variation tendency of hierarchical host-guest supramolecular\n        self-assembly system, see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E.\n      \nScanning electron microscopy (SEM)\nTiming: 1.5–2 days\n    \n      This section describes SEM test for morphology studying of hierarchical\n      host-guest supramolecular self-assemblies which have representative molar\n      ratio of host/guest molecules. Please attention: this section is not\n      suitable for very poor electrical conductive samples as well as magnetic\n      samples.\n    \n        The aqueous solution of the guest molecule is prepared according to the\n        Part:\n        Preparation of the aqueous solution of the guest molecule[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.1].\n      \n        The aqueous solution of the host molecule is prepared according to the\n        Part:\n        Preparation of host molecule aqueous solutions or dispersions[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2].\n        Mix the above-mentioned two aqueous solutions in different molar ratios\n        to prepare representative hierarchical host-guest supramolecular\n        self-assemblies which can be monitored by UV-vis and NMR experiments.\n      \nNote: (1) All vessels should be washed\n      with filtered deionized water. (2) The concentration of hierarchical\n      host-guest supramolecular self-assemblies in water should be higher than\n      the critical aggregate concentration (CAC, for acquiring CAC of sample,\n      please refer to Yan et al.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) of each hierarchical host-guest supramolecular self-assembly to make\n      sure that the photos of self-assemblies are easily taken. Meanwhile, the\n      sample concentration does not need to exceed the critical concentration by\n      an order of magnitude.\n    \n        The solution of hierarchical host-guest supramolecular self-assemblies\n        should be left standing for more than 1 h before being dropped on a dry\n        sliced wafer (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2889-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "(A) The images for the front side (top) and the reverse side\n              (bottom) of the wafer. The front side of the wafer possesses a\n              smooth mirror face and the back side of the wafer possesses a\n              rough surface.\n            \n              (B) The image of table for holding sample. In common, the sample\n              is stuck on the table by black conductive tape.\n            \n              (C–F) SEM images for hierarchical host-guest supramolecular\n              self-assemblies. The molar ratios of guest and host molecules are\n              1:0, 1:0.5, 1:1 and 1:1.5, respectively.\n            \nNote: 1. The wafer should be washed by\n      acetone and then dried. 2. The metal coating step is not recommended here.\n      (If you need metal coating step for your sample preparation, please refer\n      to Grillet et al.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5])\n    \nCritical: When handling the wafer, be\n      careful of the pipette tip to avoid damaging the smooth surface of wafer.\n    \n        Set the wafer with sample in the dark at a constant temperature (e.g.,\n        25°C) for about one night.\n      \n        Fix the wafer on the metal sample stage by double-sided conductive\n        adhesive (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\n      \n        Put the sample stage into specimen storehouse following with vacuuming.\n      \nNote: The SEM instrument is very\n      expensive. Please make sure you are qualified to operate it.\n    \n        Find the self-assemblies from the sample in low magnification with\n        original voltage carefully and patiently.\n      \nNote: In this step, patience is very\n      important.\n    \n        Once you find the self-assemblies in proper morphology, please increase\n        the magnification, turn down voltage (For example, 1.5–5 kV), focus on\n        the self-assemblies, and take photos as soon as possible.\n      \nNote: Don't stay at the same place for\n      a long time to avoid destroying the sample by electron beam (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C).\n    \n        Finally, we recommend adjusting and rearranging the photos in Microsoft\n        PowerPoint for normalization (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C–3F).\n      \nNote: The morphologies of the different\n      hierarchical host-guest supramolecular self-assembly depend on the",
    "chemical structures of host and guest molecules. For example, the CPDB is\n      an organic pyridinium salt, so the self-assembly morphology of CPDB tends\n      to be spherical nanoparticles based on amphiphilic interaction. When the\n      CPDBs interact with CB[8] molecules to form supramolecular self-assembly\n      in different binding ratios, the rigid part of host-guest complexes\n      increase, leading to the morphologies of the these supramolecular\n      self-assemblies to be more and more angular and to form 1D worm-like\n      nanoribbons, 2D rectangular nanoplates, and 3D micro polyhedrons. These\n      morphologies have also been confirmed by SEM and further TEM test results.\n    \nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM)\nTiming: 1.5–2 days\n    \n      This section describes TEM test for morphology studying of hierarchical\n      host-guest supramolecular self-assemblies which possess representative\n      molar ratio of host/guest molecules. Comparing to the SEM test, electrical\n      conductivity of sample does not need to be concerned in TEM test. However,\n      this section is not suitable for magnetic samples. Furthermore, as for\n      sample preparation, the solvent evaporation shows little effect on the\n      morphology of samples.\n    \n        The preparation of the solution of hierarchical host-guest\n        supramolecular self-assemblies is the same as that in the\n        Section: SEM test.\nNote: (1) Attention again: All vessels\n      should be washed with filtered deionized water. (2) For TEM test, the\n      concentration of sample should be no higher than 8 × 10–4 M.\n        The solution of hierarchical host-guest supramolecular self-assemblies\n        should be left standing for more than 1 h before being dropped into\n        gilder TEM grids, see Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B.\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2889-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

The front side of TEM grid is covered by\n              carbon film.\n            \n              (B) Illustration for preparing TEM sample. TEM grid is put on a\n              filter paper with the front side up, followed by dropping sample",
    "on the TEM grid slowly.\n            \n              (C–F) The TEM images for hierarchical host-guest supramolecular\n              self-assemblies. The molar ratios of guest and host are 1:0,\n              1:0.5, 1:1 and 1:1.5, respectively.\n            \nNote: 1. Put a filter paper under the\n      gilder TEM grids to keep the sample on the grids clean. 2. Normally, a\n      drop (5–10 μL) of solution is enough for one gilder TEM grid. 3. Don’t\n      mistake the front and back of the gilder TEM grid, that is, the side of\n      gilder TEM grid with carbon film should be put face to you.\n    \nCritical: When handling the grid, be\n      careful of the pipette tips and the tweezers to avoid damaging the grid\n      surface.\n    \n        Set the gilder TEM grids with sample in the dark at a constant\n        temperature (e.g., 25°C) for about one night.\n      \n        The grid should be put into a standard TEM holder, followed by placing\n        the TEM holder into specimen storehouse.\n      \nNote: The TEM instrument (More detail\n      about TEM instrument please refer to Wang et al.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) is very expensive. Please make sure you are qualified to operate it.\n    \n        Find the self-assemblies from the sample in low multiplier lens\n        carefully and patiently and take the photos in high multiplier lens.\n      \nNote: In this step, patience is very\n      important.\n    \n        Finally, we recommend to adjust and rearrange the photos in Microsoft\n        PowerPoint for normalization (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C–4F)."
