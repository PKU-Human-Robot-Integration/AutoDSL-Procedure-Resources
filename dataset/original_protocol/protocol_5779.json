    "Part I: Serial expansion of human airway basal stem cells Preparation of the ‘Complete Airway Basal Cell Culturing Medium’ (see Recipe 1)Preparation of 804G-conditioned mediumCulture 804G cells in RPMI + 10% FBS + 1:100 penicillin/streptomycin (optional) on 15-cm2 dishes or T175 flasks until they reach confluence. Change medium daily. Once the cells reach confluence, add a large volume of culture medium (60-100 ml) to each dish or flask.From this point, the medium will be collected to make 804G-conditioned medium. Change medium every other day. Collect the supernatant that is enriched with matrix proteins. The collection can be performed up to 4 times. Combine all collected supernatants, filter through 0.4 μm filter units and aliquot in 250 ml bottles. The 804G-conditioned medium can be stored at 4 °C for up to 2 months and -20 °C for up to 1 year.Culture and serial expansion of human airway basal cells (Figures 1A and 1B)Human airway basal cells are isolated from fresh discarded lung tissues using a protocol reported previously (Fulcher et al., 2005). Ensure that you have obtained proper authorization from your institution review board to obtain human samples for experimentation.Pre-coat culture plates for all airway basal cell culture. To coat the plates, add sufficient 804G-conditioned medium to cover culturable areas (see Table 2), incubate the plates at 37 °C overnight, or for at least 2 h. Aspirate as much 804G-conditioned medium as possible or briefly rinse with PBS. It is our experience, human primary airway basal cells prefer 804G coating over collagen, fibronectin, matrigel and other combinations of coating media. Morphology of human airway basal cells cultured on 804G-coated plates is better than those cultured on collagen-coated plates. However, if you are culturing mouse cells rather than human cells, collagen-coated plates or uncoated plates are preferred.",
    "Culture the airway basal cells in ‘Complete Airway Basal Cell Culturing Medium’ on 804G-coated plates until they reach 80-90% confluence. Change medium daily. Based on our experience, the initial cell density has minimal effects on cell morphology and cell proliferation rate. You can start the cell culture at a confluence from 3% to 30%. For the routine cell maintenance, we start the cells at 10-20% confluence; the cells will reach 80-90% confluence after 4 days.Table 2.

Immunofluorescence of basal stem cell markers (CK5 and p63) and airway-specific transcription factors (NKX2.1 and FOXA2) on cultured airway basal cells (Passage 6). Scale bars = 20 μm.To split the cells, wash the cells with PBS, then add enough volume of 0.5% Trypsin to cover the cells and incubate at 37 °C. Monitor the cell dissociation under a microscope after 3 min. When the cells are loosened, stop trypsin digestion by adding DMEM (or RPMI) + 10% FBS. Gently transfer the cell suspension to a centrifuge tube.Centrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature.Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in an appropriate volume of ‘complete Airway Basal Cell Culturing Medium’. Seed the airway basal cells at the desired density (from 5-20% confluence). Change the medium every day to maintain good morphology of the cells and their exponential proliferation rate. For a 6-well plate, add 1.5 ml to 2 ml per well.",
    "When the cells reach 80-90% confluence, split them again at 1:10 with the same procedure as described above. Human airway basal cells have a population doubling time around 30-35 h (Mou et al., 2016), so it takes ~4-5 days for another passage if the cells are split at 1:10.Immunofluorescence characterization of cultured airway basal cells (Figure 1C)Assess the stemness of airway basal cells every 3-4 passages along the course of their serial expansion. The stemness of airway basal cells is scored with the following criteria: (a) Expression of stem cell markers (p63 and CK5), and airway-specific markers (NKX2.1 and FOXA2); (b) Possession of robust proliferation potential, meaning that cells can self-renew at an exponential rate; (c) Possession of differentiation potential, meaning that cells can differentiate into main types of airway epithelium including basal cells, ciliated cells, club cells, and mucin-secreting goblet cells (see Part II and Figure 2). Note: The maximal passage number of a given airway basal cell line, until complete depletion of its proliferative potential, is variable and individual cell line-dependent. The airway basal cells can be expanded for a long time under the established conditions described herein. We are generally able to passage our cells to passage 25 or beyond, while maintaining the overall differentiation efficiency based on the staining of mucus-producing goblet cells and cilia-bearing ciliated cells. However, this potential likely declines with each passage. We have reported that the prolonged culture would influence some physiological functions such as CFTR expression and chloride conductance (Mou et al., 2016). The speed of the declination in channel function over cell passage is faster than the speed of the declination in the ability to proliferate and generate airway epithelium. Therefore, the recommendation of “working maximal passage number” is dependent on the cellular analysis to be performed.",
    "For example, if the one intends to study CFTR channel biology, we would suggest using the cells “younger” than passage 6-8 at 1:10 splitting ratio. Whereas, if one’s goal is to generate airway epithelium or to study the response of airway epithelium to cytokines and pathogens, he/she can expand the cells for more passages. Based on our data, airway epithelium differentiated from airway basal cells even at passage 20 still respond robustly to IL-13 to induce goblet cell hyperplasia.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180531/20180531225254_9913.jpgFigure 2.

The phase contrast images of primary airway epithelial culture of ALI culture at variable time points.Fix the cells in culture with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 5 min at room temperature. Wash the cells three times with PBS + 0.2% Triton X-100. Incubate the cells with washing buffer for 30 sec at room temperature for each interval of washing. Cover the cells with primary antibodies diluted in PBS + 1% BSA and incubate at room temperature for 2 h or at 4 °C overnight. For example, add 100 μl of antibody solution to each well of 48-well plate, or 500 μl of antibody solution to each well of 12-well plates.Wash the cells four times with PBS + 0.2% Triton X-100. Incubate the cells with washing buffer for 30 sec at room temperature for each interval of washing. Cover the cells with fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in PBS + 1% BSA and incubate at room temperature for 1 h (protect from the light).",
    "For example, add 100 μl of antibody solution to each well of 48-well plate, or 500 μl of antibody solution to each well of 12-well plates.Wash the cells four times with PBS + 0.2% Triton X-100. For most markers listed in Table 1, incubate the wash buffer for 10-30 sec. Cover the cells with enough 1 μg/ml DAPI solution in (Milli-Q®)-H2O. Incubate for 1 min and then image the cells with the Olympus IX81 inverted fluorescence microscope. Part II: Mucociliary differentiation of airway basal stem cells on the air-liquid interface Preparation of ‘Complete ALI Medium’ (see Recipe 2)Mucociliary differentiation of human airway basal cells on the air-liquid interface (Figure 2)Cell seeding (up to 1 day)A day prior seeding, pre-coat the transwell membranes with 804G-conditioned medium (for 24-well transwell, we add 150 μl coating medium/well; for 12-well transwell, we add 400 μl coating medium/well). Split the cells from the culture dishes and seed the cells at a density of ~5 x 103/mm2 in ‘Complete Airway Basal Cell Culturing Medium’ (see Part I). Add sufficient ‘Complete Airway Basal Cell Culturing Medium’ to both upper and lower chambers (for example, for a 12-well transwell plate, add 300-500 µl of culture medium to the upper chamber and 500-1,000 µl of culture medium to the lower chamber). At this seeding density, the cells should immediately reach 100% confluence upon attachment. Cell expansion on transwell membrane is not generally recommended since it will cause heterogeneity in differentiation and result in lower differentiation efficiency. If the cell number is not enough, briefly expand the cells until they reach 100% confluence (we suggest no more than 2 days of cell expansion).",
    "Pre-ALI treatment (up to 1 day)Remove ‘Complete Airway Basal Cell Culturing Medium’ from upper and bottom chambers, replace with ‘Complete ALI Medium’, incubate the cells at 37 °C overnight or at least for 2 h.Mucociliary differentiation on ALI (> 15 days)Remove the ‘Complete ALI Medium’ from the upper chamber to initiate an air-liquid interface. Add the same ALI medium only to the bottom chamber. Change medium every 2 days until the differentiation is well established.Ciliogenesis can be monitored by inverted-phase microscopy (Video 1). The appearance of ciliated cells can be observed after 11-14 days depending on cell passage. We usually culture ALI for 16-20 days as a standard protocol. For cells at later passages, a longer time of ALI differentiation may be required. To facilitate the cell stratification (the basal cells need to stratify from a single cell layer to more layers to differentiate) and mucociliary differentiation efficiency especially from the aged airway basal cells, we recommend adding 1 μM A8301 + 5 μM ROCKi to ‘Complete ALI Medium’ for use during the first week of differentiation.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Human airway stem cells (P6) were differentiated on ALI for 20 days. The cilia beating was visualized under the Olympus IX81 inverted microscope. Scale bar = 20 μm.Whole mount immunofluorescence characterization of differentiated airway epithelium (Figure 3A)Aspirate the ALI medium in the lower chamber.Fix the cells on transwell membranes by adding PFA 4% to both upper chamber and bottom chamber. Place the plates at 4 °C for 10 min.Aspirate the PFA and wash the membranes 3 times with PBS. At this point, transwell membranes can be stored in PBS for up to one week at 4 °C until the immunofluorescence staining can be performed.Excise the membrane from the transwell using a sharp scalpel.",
    "Cut the membranes into 4 pieces (if 12 mm2 membranes are used) or cut the membranes into 2 pieces (if 6.5 mm2 membranes are used).Place each membrane piece in a 2 ml Eppendorf tube and add PBS + 0.2% Triton to permeabilize the cells. Incubate for 5 min. Aspirate the PBS + 0.1% Triton solution. Cover the membrane piece with 150 μl primary antibodies diluted in PBS + 1% BSA and incubate at room temperature for 2 h or at 4 °C for overnight.Wash the membrane piece four times with PBS + 0.2% Triton X-100.Cover the membrane piece with 150 μl fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in PBS + 1% BSA and incubate at room temperature for 1 h (protect from the light).Wash the cells four times with PBS + 0.2% Triton X-100.Cover the membrane piece with 150 μl 1 μg/ml DAPI solution in (Milli-Q®)-H2O. Incubate for 1 min. Add a small drop of Fluoromount-G on a microscope slide. Take out the membrane piece and put it (with the cell side face up) in the Fluromount-G drop. Gently add the coverslip, avoiding any bubble formation.Image the immunofluorescence using an Olympus Fluoview FV10i Confocal Microscope or a Nikon A1 Confocal Laser Microscope.Immunofluorescence characterization of differentiated airway epithelium on transverse membrane sections (Figure 3B)Fix and excise transwell membranes as described above. Transfer the excised membranes in any containers to process the membranes for cryosectioning. We routinely use 12-well plates for this purpose. Incubate the excised membrane with 30% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4 °C.Transfer the membranes to 30% sucrose:OCT (1:1) and incubate for 1-2 h at room temperature.Transfer the membranes to 100% OCT and incubate for 15 min at room temperature.",
    "Cut the membranes into 2-4 pieces and embed the membrane in a vertical position in 100% OCT on a cold metal platform on dry ice.Cut 4-7 μm frozen sections using a standard cryo-sectioning protocol. Store the sections at -20 °C for up to 1 year or at -80 °C for a longer time.To stain the airway epithelial cells on transverse sections, remove the OCT by rinsing the slides briefly with tap water. Circle the tissue with ImmEdge Hydrophobic Barrier PAP Pen. Stain the slides sequentially with primary and secondary antibodies using a similar protocol described above.Image the immunofluorescence using an Olympus Fluoview FV10i Confocal Microscope or a Nikon A1 Confocal Laser Microscope.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180531/20180531230300_4516.jpgFigure 3.
