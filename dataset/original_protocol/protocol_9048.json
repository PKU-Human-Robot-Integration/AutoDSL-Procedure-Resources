    "1. Surgical Procedures and Fluid Percussion TBI\nAll animal experiments are first approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas and the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8th Edition, National Research Council).\nRats (adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, 400-500 g obtained from vendor Charles Rivers, Portland, Maine) are housed two per cage and provided food and water ad libitum in a vivarium with these constant conditions: light cycle (600 hr to 1,800 hr), temperature (21 °C to 23 °C), and humidity (40% to 50%) one week prior to use.\nAnesthetize rats with 4% isoflurane, intubate, and mechanically ventilate (NEMI Scientific; New England Medical Instruments, Medway, MA) the rats with 1.5-2.0% isoflurane in oxygen: air (70:30) and prepare them for parasagittal fluid-percussion injury as previously described.8,10\nSacrifice rats at the appropriate time point after injury depending on the experimental design. Quickly remove brains, freeze immediately on dry ice, and store at -80 °C in a 50 ml tube or proceed immediately to embed in OCT for frozen sectioning.\n2. Sectioning and Staining of Rat Brain",
    "Brain tissue that is not used immediately can be kept at -80 °C for up to one month if kept at a constant temperature. Brains that are frozen at -80 °C, then thawed to -20 °C for sectioning, and then re-frozen do not yield quality RNA after the second thawing. Once the brain is thawed, mounted in OCT and sectioned, slides should be stained within 24 hr and used for LCM within 30 min to one hour of staining. This will ensure good quality RNA. Following LCM, captured cells on LCM caps can be stored in lysis buffer at -80 °C for up to one week, but RNA should be isolated in a timely manner to ensure the highest quality.\nPrior to sectioning the brain, wipe the cryostat with RNase-Zap and clean the brushes with ETOH (replace the disposable blade between each brain).\nRetrieve the brain in the 50 ml tube from the -80 °C freezer; place it into the cryostat at a temperature of -22 °C and thaw in tube for approximately 10 min. Remove the brain from the tube and place onto the stage on gauze, ventral side up.\nUsing a razor blade, slice the brain to remove the posterior portion of the brain just rostral to the cerebellum and the anterior portion at the optic chiasm. Fill a cryomold with OCT mounting medium (Tissue Tek), and place the brain into the mold with the anterior side down. Allow the brain tissue to freeze in the mounting medium until it turns white (approximately 10 min).\nFreeze the specimen disc (Tissue Tek) onto the brain with OCT. Remove the brain from the mold. Insert the brain into the specimen head and tighten the screws.",
    "Insert a disposable, low profile blade (Fisher Scientific) into the knife holder and tighten the lever down.\nBegin slicing the brain at 20 μm to remove the outer layer of OCT. Once the hippocampal region is reached, set the micron dial to 10. Collect coronal serial sections by placing a glass slide or plus-glass slide onto the tissue section (Fisher Scientific). Slides are preserved at -20 °C in an RNase-free staining rack until sectioning is complete.\nTo remove all RNases from glassware where tissue sections are processed, wipe down all staining containers and graduated cylinders with Eliminase (Fisher Scientific) and rinse in Milli Q water. Prepare all solutions with RNase-free water and filter the cresyl violet (Sigma-Aldrich) and Fluoro-Jade (Histo-chem) stain with a 0.2 μm filter prior to use.\nThaw brain sections at RT for 30 sec and fix in 75% ETOH (1 min).\nFor LCM of single injured neurons after fixation, rinse slides in RNase-free water (1 min), counterstain with 1% cresyl violet (15-20 sec), rinse in RNase-free water (2 × 30 sec), stain with Fluoro-Jade (4 min), rinse in RNase-free water (3 × 1 min), dehydrate with 95% ETOH made from RNase-free water (30 sec), 100% ETOH (30 sec), and xylene ( 2 × 3 min).\nFor LCM of swaths of neurons after fixation, rinse slides in RNase-free water (1 min), stain with 1% cresyl violet (1 min), rinse in RNase-free water for (3 × 1 min), dehydrate with 95% ETOH (2 × 30 sec), 100% ETOH (2 × 30 sec), and xylene (2 × 3 min).",
    "Air dry all sections in a fume hood for 15 min prior to LCM. Slides can be stored, section sides up, in a slide box lined with dessicant, if they need to be transferred from room to room. However, optimal results are obtained if LCM is performed immediately after sections are dry. LCM should be limited from 30 min to 1 hr. In the next section, we describe first how to capture continuous swaths of cells, which is easiest to master for those who are learning this technique. Then we describe how to precisely capture single neurons. In our procedure, we identify dying neurons by their affinity for Fluoro-Jade-a marker of degenerating neurons. Fluoro-Jade-negative cells are presumed to be surviving neurons.\n3. Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM)\nLCM of swaths of enriched populations of hippocampal neurons\nLCM is performed using a PixCell IIe microscope with an infrared diode laser (Life Technologies).\nAdjust the center joystick to the vertical position. Rotate and lock the 4X objective into position.\nPlace a slide at the center of the microscope stage and manually adjust until the region of the hippocampus is in view. Use coarse and fine focus adjustments to bring the image into focus.\nActivate the vacuum chuck by pressing the vacuum button on the controller. Rotate and lock the 10X objective into place. Focus again with coarse and fine adjustments.\nLoad the CapSure Macro LCM caps (Life Technologies) into the CapSure cassette module and position a cap at the load line position. Rotate the Cap Placement arm and position around the cap. Raise the Cap Placement arm to remove the CapSure cap from the cassette module.",
    "Rotate the Cap Placement arm over the slide and lower the arm down over the slide; this will place the cap onto the slide. Adjust the fine focus and move the joystick to check if cells are inside the black circle on the cap. All cell captures should be inside this black circle.\nSet the laser parameters. First, press the laser-enable button on the controller. The laser target spot will be visible as a pink dot in the field of view on the computer monitor.\nSet the laser spot size to small (7.5 μm) to focus the laser and adjust the power and duration to 65 - 75 mW, for 1.0-2.0 msec as needed for optimal cell capture.\nTo test the laser, use the joystick to move the laser spot to an area where there are no cells to pick up. Fire the laser using the thumb switch. Use the joystick to move the laser spot away from the melted polymer spot and check to see if a visible dark ring surrounds a clear area where the laser was fired.\nTo capture cells, use the joystick to move the laser spot over the area of cells to capture. Fire the laser using the thumb switch. Move the joystick while firing the laser to capture a large area of cells. When the laser is fired it melts the thermoplastic polymer film on the cap to the surface of the target cells. The polymer absorbs the laser radiation, thus not altering the RNA, DNA or protein ensuring the integrity of the sample for future molecular applications.",
    "After firing all cells of interest, lift the Cap Placement arm. The captured cells will separate from the tissue section and adhere to the CapSure cap. The remaining tissue and missing cells will be visible in the field of view. The cells on the cap can also be viewed by placing the cap on an empty portion of the slide.\nLift the Cap Placement arm and rotate it to the Cap Unload Station. Lower the cap into the station and rotate the Cap Placement arm back into its previous position.\nSlide the CapSure insertion tool along the platform and onto the cap. Lift the tool from the platform. The cap will remain attached. Lightly touch the cap to the CapSure clean pad to clean away unwanted tissue.\nPlace the cap into a 0.5 ml RNase-free tube filled with 100 μl of lysis buffer obtained from the RNAqueous Micro-Isolation Kit. Immediately vortex the cap for 30 sec to lyse the cells. Incubate the samples at 42 °C for 30 min and freeze at -80 °C until RNA isolation.\nLCM of single FJ+ neurons in the hippocampus\nTo capture single cells, load CapSure HS LCM caps into the CapSure cassette module and position a cap at the load line position. Rotate the Cap Placement arm and position it around the cap. Raise the Cap Placement arm to remove the CapSure cap from the cassette module.\nSet the laser spot size to small (7.5 μm) to focus the laser and adjust the laser power and duration to 65 -75 mW for 0.45 to 0.50 msec for optimal cell capture of single cells.",
    "Rotate the Cap Placement arm over the slide and lower the arm down toward the slide. This will place the cap onto the slide. The Capsure HS cap surface sits elevated from the sample during LCM.\nUse the joystick to move the laser over single FJ+ cells. All cells being captured must be inside the small black ring on the cap. Fire the laser using the thumb switch.\nWhen all cells within the black circle area have been fired with the laser, lift the Cap Placement arm. The captured cells will separate from the tissue section and adhere to the CapSure HS cap.\nPlace another slide on the microscope stage and collect FJ+ cells until the HS cap is full. Place the cap into a 0.5 ml RNase-free tube filled with 40-50 μl of lysis buffer. Immediately vortex the cap for 30 sec to lyse the cells. Incubate the samples at 42 °C for 30 min and freeze at -80 °C until RNA isolation.\n4. Total RNA Isolation From LCM Samples (This section will just be described in the video presentation)\nTotal RNA from cells is isolated using the RNAqueous-Micro Kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's protocols. All reagents and wash solutions are provided in this kit. Pre-wet the micro filter cartridge assembly by adding 30 μl of lysis solution buffer to the filter. After 5 min, centrifuge the filter for 30 sec at 10,000 × g.\nAdd 3 μl of LCM additive to the sample lysate, pipette to mix, and centrifuge.\nAdd 52 μl of 100% ETOH (1/2 volume) to the sample lysate; pipette to mix, and transfer the lysate to the filter column.",
    "Centrifuge the filter column at 10,000 × g for 1 min to bind the RNA to the column. If there are multiple caps for one sample, spin each lysate through the same column separately.\nComplete the RNA isolation procedure as described in the RNAqueous Micro kit.\nPerform DNase treatment and DNase inactivation of LCM RNA samples as described in the kit, transfer the RNA to a RNase-free tube and store at -80 °C.\n5. RNA Quantification and Downstream Applications\nAssessment of RNA quality and quantification is performed with an Agilent Bioanalyzer using reagents from the Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol.\nTotal RNA is analyzed on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies). The software evaluates the concentration and the integrity of the RNA sample by assigning an RNA Integrity Number (RIN) to each sample ranging from 1 to 10. 1-5 indicates degraded RNA and 7-10 indicates good quality RNA.\nNon-degraded intact RNA will be used for Real-Time PCR; individual Taqman assays or RT2 profiler arrays using Sybr-green chemistry. The RNA can also be used for mRNA microarray analysis and microRNA microarray analysis."
