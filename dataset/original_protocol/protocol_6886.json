    "Plant growthGerminate Arabidopsis thaliana seeds (ecotype Columbia seed stock source CS60000) in (2.5‚Äù √ó 2.5‚Äù √ó 3‚Äù) pots filled with soil containing 1% marathon (OHP, Inc., Marathon 1% Granular, 5 lbs., 985490.0) and 1% osmocote (Classic 3-4 Month 14-14-4 Fertilizer 50 lb., E90550).Grow plants in Adaptis A1000 growth chambers (Conviron MODEL No. A1000, SERIAL No. 150031) set to 200 Œºmol m‚àí2 s‚àí1 photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), 24 ¬± 1¬∞C, 60% humidity, and a 14 h/10 h day/night regime.Water the plants once every three days.For all experiments, use Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 plants that are 3 weeks old (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4060/bioprotoc-11-12-4060-g001.jpgFigure 1. Leaves of 3-week-old Arabidopsis thaliana plants (Col-0) were used for nanoparticle infiltration Synthesis of quantum dotsTo synthesize quantum dots (QDs), prepare a colloidal solution of 0.01 g CdCl2 and 40 ¬µl mercaptopropionic acid in 50 ml molecular grade water.Label this solution A, add a stir bar, and stir the solution at 500 rpm and room temperature.Next, adjust the pH of solution A to 11.4 with 1 M NaOH added dropwise. Place solution A on a hot plate set to 100¬∞C and allow to reflux. Stir solution A at 700 rpm.Meanwhile, label a 20-ml glass vial with a cap as solution B.Add 0.05 g NaBH4 and 0.02 g tellurium powder into the 20-ml vial labeled solution B.Add 600 ¬µl 50% ethanol into the 20-ml vial and add a stir bar. Make sure to dispense the ethanol gently into the glass vial labeled solution B.Keep the solution lightly capped to avoid air entering the reaction (Figure 2A).Place solution B onto a hot plate set to 70¬∞C and stir at 300 rpm.Allow solution B to react for 5-10 min. The solution will turn from a dark black color to purple-blue, producing NaHTe for later use (Figure 2A-2B).",
