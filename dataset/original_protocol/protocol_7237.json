    "Genomic DNA digestionPlace approximately 3–4 µg of DNA (estimate using fluorimetry, spectrophotometrically, or via gel electrophoresis) from each sample in a 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube, and make up to 40 µL with ultra-pure water.Add 5 µL of 10× CutSmart buffer, and 40 units of the corresponding enzyme of interest. Make up the total reaction volume to 50 µL with ultrapure water.Incubate the sealed tubes in a water bath set to the optimal temperature for the enzyme being used for 12 to 16 h, to facilitate complete digestion. In case the water bath does not contain a flow agitator to mix the samples, manually mix by tapping at 3 h intervals.Post-incubation, add 8 µL of 8× DNA loading buffer to the reaction mix. Gently tap and spin the tube to collect the contents, and proceed for gel electrophoresis.Note: If required, digested DNA with loading buffer can be stored at -20°C indefinitely. Inference LINE1 is a conserved transposon that is regulated via DNA methylation in plants (Cui et al., 2013). In this example, DNA methylation and transposon copy number status were compared at the LINE1 locus between a wild type (WT) rice variety - Pusa Basmati1 (Oryza sativa Indica spp.), and a knockdown mutant of a plant specific RNA silencing mutant (for details, please refer to Sundar et al., 2021). Figure 1A demonstrates DNA hypomethylation in the mutant genotype, as additional lower size bands were observed in specific plant samples (HpaII lanes). Genomic DNA subjected to test was extracted from leaf samples of the equally-grown 40 days old WT and mutant rice plants. When the DNA is digested with methylation sensitive enzymes, portions that are hypomethylated are prone to enzyme activity, hence, accumulating shorter DNA fragments compared to their methylated counterparts.",
    "When hybridised to a complementary labelled strand, we observed additional lower sized fragments reflecting their hypomethylated states. Similar hypomethylation was observed in the MspI and HaeII lanes, for the corresponding sample. Taken together, these differential banding patterns corroborate that specific lines of mutant genotypes show DNA hypomethylation in the LINE1 locus.  Figure 1B shows the transposon display map (transposon copy number profile) of the LINE1 transposon in mutant lines. Additional bands (red arrow) in the mutants show that the LINE1 element has proliferated in the genome, upon loss of DNA methylation in the mutant genotype. When the transposon proliferates, the new integration sites in the genome will have a different pattern of enzyme recognition sites adjacent to the location of integration, compared to the original copies of the transposon. When digested with different enzymes, these additional copies tend to create a hybridisation profile that exhibits these new digested fragments.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4432/bioprotoc-12-11-4432-g001.jpgFigure 1. Southern blots for DNA methylation and copy number investigation of LINE1 transposon in different genotypes of rice. A. Profiles of LINE1-probe–hybridised fragments from different genotypes of rice. DNA digested with methylation-sensitive enzymes (HpaII, MspI, and HaeII) was electrophoresed, blotted, and hybridised with the probe amplified from the LINE1 fragment in rice genome, using the oligos 5’-tctctggacgagcctgttccaa-3’ and 5’-ggctaagtcgtcagttgaatgc-3’. The additional bands (red arrow) denote that the particular mutant genotypes have a differential methylation pattern when compared to the WT samples. B. Transposon copy number blot showing additional transposition events of LINE1 transposon in the mutant lines (red arrow).Gel electrophoresis:Setup a clean gel casting apparatus with a suitable comb (each well should be able to hold approximately 75 µL). Use a bubble-level to make sure that the gel tray is assembled on a straight surface without inclination.Weigh the amount of UltraPureTM agarose required for casting a 0.",
    "8% (w/v) gel, and melt this in a microwave oven, in an appropriate volume of 1× TBE buffer inside a glass bottle. Avoid boiling of the gel mix, as this may change the concentration of the buffer. Measure the molten gel mix again, and make up for the evaporation loss with sterile water. Allow the mixture to cool down. Once the temperature is approximately 65°C, pour the gel mix into the gel casting tray, and let it set for 45 min.Note: For a standard 15 × 10 cm gel tray, around 160 mL of 0.8% 1× TBE gel is needed for a ~1.5 cm-thick gel, accommodating ~75 µL-well volume. Fill the gel electrophoresis tank with the required volume of freshly diluted 1× TBE buffer, and place the gel in the apparatus until it is completely immersed.Load the digested DNA in the wells and include a 1-kb DNA ladder (~1 µg). Electrophorese at 80 V (~8 V/cm of gel length) until the bromophenol blue tracking dye reaches the bottom of the gel (~2.5 h).Ethidium Bromide staining and visualisationTransfer the gel to a clean glass tray (holding capacity of approximately 1 L) containing enough volume of ethidium bromide staining solution (~350 mL). The staining solution contains 0.5 µg/mL of ethidium bromide in water.Shake gently on a gel rocker for 15–20 min, and image the gel in a UV gel imaging system. This image acts both as loading control, and to examine the extent of digestion.Depurination, denaturation, and neutralisationTo aid in the efficient transfer of higher molecular weight DNA fragments, rock the gel gently in an immersing amount of depurination solution for 20–30 min, until the bromophenol blue dye changes to an orange colour.Note: In case the expected fragment sizes are less than 5 kb, the depurination step can be avoided.",
    "Discard the depurination solution, replace with copious amounts of denaturation solution, and gently shake in a rocker for 1 h.Discard the denaturation solution, and wash the gel with copious amounts of water (~20 gel volumes). Repeat four times to eliminate any residual buffer.Pour 20 gel volumes (~350 mL) of neutralisation solution, and continue gentle rocking for 1 h. Using a sharp scalpel, trim the wells of the gel retaining only the electrophoresed gel portion.Capillary transfer to nylon membrane (Figure 2A)In a large trough, place an inverted gel tray (acting as a plank). Cut a Whatman sheet into a long rectangular wick, whose width is equal to the width of the trimmed gel. The length of the wick should be long enough to fold within the tray bottom.Pour the trough with sufficient 20× SSC buffer, to completely wet the wick. Carefully invert the gel (with the loading side facing the bottom plank), and place it on the wet wick. Cut the Zeta Probe nylon membrane to the exact trimmed gel dimensions, and dip it in water for 3 s in a small tray first, and then immerse it in 20× SSC in another tray.Thoroughly pour the gel with the 20× SSC buffer, and carefully place the membrane on the gel, avoiding air bubbles.Note: Once placed on the gel, the membrane must not be moved. The gel contact-side of the membrane shall be labelled with pencil on the corner, as required for identification of the blot. Once the gel is placed, if air bubbles are to be removed, a sterile serological pipette must be used to gently roll over the membrane, eliminating air pockets. Cut three Whatman sheets of membrane dimensions, and carefully place sequentially over the membrane.",
    "Dip the first two sheets in 20× SSC buffer and place on the gel, while the third sheet is placed on the wet Whatman sheets, without pre-wetting. Use a serological pipette to gently roll over the sheets, to eliminate gaps and air pockets.Vertically stack up the setup with 10–12 cm of Whatman blotting sheets cut to the dimension of the membrane. Place a plank over the sheets, and top this up with a ~200 g weight (like a glass bottle). Allow the capillary transfer to proceed for 14–16 h post-setup at room temperature.Note: Make sure the trough has sufficient amount of 20× SSC buffer at the bottom for the entire duration of capillary transfer. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4432/bioprotoc-12-11-4432-g002.jpgFigure 2. Southern capillary transfer and crosslinking. A. Graphical representation of the Southern capillary blotting setup. B. Photograph of the UV crosslinker that generates continuous UV-C beam at the required dosage.UV-crosslinking the membrane:Carefully disassemble the setup, and keep a tray of freshly prepared 2× SSC buffer.Using forceps, carefully withdraw the membrane from the gel, and immerse it in a tray of 2× SSC for 15–20 s. This step removes salt precipitates deposited on the membrane.Immediately place the membrane on a dry Whatman paper, with the transferred side facing up, and proceed to the UV-crosslinker.Crosslink the DNA with the membrane using UV-C irradiation of 1200 Joules of continuous pulse. The UV irradiator provides a continuous beam of UV light, until 1200 joules of energy is irradiated uniformly over the surface of the membrane (Figure 2B).Place the membrane in a sealed plastic cover, and store at 4°C until hybridisation.Note: The post-transfer gel can be re-stained with ethidium bromide to check for residual DNA, and hence the transfer efficiency. It is normal to observe partial retention of high molecular weight DNA fragments (~above 25 kb).",
    "Radioactive labelling of the probe:Place approximately 25 ng of purified homogeneous DNA of the probe region of interest in a volume of 45 µL topped up with 1× TE buffer, in a 0.2-mL PCR tube.Note: The desired probe should be gel eluted and purified post PCR amplification or plasmid digestion, so that there is no other contaminating dsDNA molecule. The probe must be eluted in 1× TE buffer. See notes for characteristics of an ideal probe. Heat the probe solution in the thermal cycler at 99°C for 6–7 min, and immediately place on ice without delay, to retain the probe in a denatured state.Add the probe mix from ice to the vial of Rediprime labelling kit. To this vial, add 5 µL of [α-32P] dCTP, and gently mix 10 times using a pipette, to dissolve the lyophilised reaction mix without bubbles. Incubate in a thermomixer at 37°C for 30 min.Add 2 µL of 0.5 M EDTA to stop the reaction. Purify the reaction mix to remove unlabelled [α-32P] dCTP and other reaction components, using a G-50 column, as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, pinch off the plastic seal of the G-50 column, and spin at 800 × g for 1 min to remove the preservative buffer. Place the tube on the fresh 1.5-mL collection tube, and add the labelled reaction mix carefully over the column bed. Spin again at 800 × g to collect the purified probe.Hybridisation, stringency washes, and exposure to imaging screen:Heat the hybridisation buffer to 65°C in an oven. Place the rolled membrane in a hybridisation bottle, and add 50 mL of pre-heated (to 65°C) hybridisation buffer. Place the bottle in a pre-heated hybridisation oven. Allow this pre-hybridisation step at 65°C to proceed for 2 h with slow rotation (around 12–15 rpm) of the hybridisation bottles.",
    "(This is to facilitate uniform coverage of the membrane with hybridisation buffer, and to block the regions without DNA).Remove the hybridisation buffer, and replace with 10–12 mL of the fresh pre-heated hybridisation buffer. Allow rotation in the oven for 10–15 min.Denature the purified radio-labelled probe in a thermomixer at 99°C for 5 min. Immediately place on ice.Add the denatured probe into the hybridisation bottle at 65°C as quickly as possible. Allow the hybridisation to proceed with slow rotation at 65°C for 16–20 h.Discard the hybridisation buffer into the radioactive waste, and add 30 mL of wash buffer 1 pre-heated to 65°C. Shake and rinse the blot vigorously, and replace with 50 mL of fresh wash buffer 1. Proceed to rotation in an oven for 30 min.Note: All the wash buffers must be pre-heated to 65°C, and the washing steps occur at the same temperature with gentle rotation. Discard wash buffer 1, and replace with 40 mL of wash buffer 2. Incubate in an oven for 30 min. Replace wash buffer 2 with wash buffer 3, and again proceed for 30 min.After the washes, rinse the blot with 60 mL of 2× SSC buffer (at room temperature). Seal the blot in a wet state in a plastic cover, and fix the sealed blot in an exposure cassette with the DNA side facing up. Place the freshly erased phosphor imaging screen on the blot, and close the exposure cassette. Ideally, 2–3 days of exposure time at room temperature is sufficient.Imaging the screen, and stripping the blot:Image the screen on a molecular imager, with a suitable wavelength of laser excitation and maximum photo multiplier tube (PMT) excitation voltage. The image can be acquired with the software provided with the molecular imager (.gel format), and analysed using ImageJ software package.",
    "The blot is now ready for stripping and re-probing.Note: Ascertain that the blot is always kept wet with a layer of 2× SSC buffer, if stripping and re-probing is to be performed. Dry blots are hard to strip. Pre-heat the oven and wash buffer 3 to 92°C. Add the hot wash buffer 3 to a hybridisation bottle containing the blot, and rotate at the same temperature for 15 min. Discard, replace with fresh wash buffer 3, and continue for 15 more minutes.Wash the blot extensively with 2× SSC buffer at room temperature, and store it at 4°C in a sealed cover until a further round of hybridisation with a new probe."
