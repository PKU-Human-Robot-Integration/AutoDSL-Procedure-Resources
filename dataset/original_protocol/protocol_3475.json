    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSacrifice mice\nTiming: ~30 min\nThe steps include preparation of testes from mice.\nSacrifice mice using isoflurane inhalation in the closed chamber and open the lower abdomen using surgical scissors (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/362-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Preparation of mouse testes\n(A) View of mouse with opening at the lower abdomen on the dissection tray. Arrows indicate epididymal fat.\n(B) Pulling epididymal fat can expose testes and epididymis. Arrow indicates testis.\n(C) Removal of epididymal fat and epididymis around testes.\n(D) Removal of tunica albuginea. Arrow indicates tunica albuginea of testis.\nExpose testes by pulling epididymal fat and remove fat and epididymis around testes (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C).\nTransfer testes to cold DPBS, and wash blood. Then, remove the tunica albuginea of testes (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nTransfer the tunica albuginea-removed testes to digestion media I (10 mL).\nPreparation of single-cell suspension of testes (testicular cells)\nTiming: ~100 min\nThe steps exhibit dissociation of testes using enzymes to get single-cell suspension of testes (testicular cells).\nPrimary digestion is performed at 37°C (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/362-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Digestion of mouse testes\n(A) The left image shows decapitulated testes in digestion media I. In 15 min, seminiferous tubules of testes are dissociated (right).\n(B) Digested product poured over 5% Percoll solution is separated by gravity (left). In 20 min, high density seminiferous tubules sink to the bottom (right).\n(C) Secondary digestion results in single-cell suspension from seminiferous tubules.\nFollowing incubation for 5 min, dissociate testes thorough pipetting.\nIncubate for 15 min further. Then, gently pipette until seminiferous tubules are dissociated.\nCritical: Seminiferous tubules should be maintained intact. Too much pipetting can result in fragmentation of tubules.",
    "Load the digested product over the top of 5% Percoll solution (40 mL) at 20°C–25°C. In 20 min, while the majority of interstitial cells are distributed at the top of the solution, highly dense seminiferous tubules sink at the bottom (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nRemove 35 mL of supernatant and transfer 5 mL of bottom including seminiferous tubules to digestion media II (10 mL).\nSecondary digestion is performed for 20 min at 37°C. Carefully pipette until seminiferous tubules disappear (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nAdd FBS 3 mL to neutralize trypsin.\nCritical: Digestion for a long time can cause cell aggregation (see Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nThe digested product is filtered through a 70 μm cell strainer and 40 μm cell strainer sequentially.\nCentrifuge filtered cell suspension with 500 × g at 4°C for 10 min.\nPipette cell pellet with HBSS (1×) 1 mL and centrifuge it with 500 × g at 4°C for 2 min. Pipette cell pellet with RBC lysis buffer (1×, dilution with distilled water) 1 mL and incubate at 4°C for 1 min. Then, centrifuge it with 500 × g at 4°C for 2 min.\nCritical: Keep the time for this step. Too long time for RBC lysis can damage testicular cells.\nPipette cells with HBSS (1×) 1 mL and then centrifuge with 500 × g at 4°C for 2 min.\nPipette cells with 1 mL of 0.5% BSA.\nUnit gravity sedimentation in BSA density gradient\nTiming: ~4 h\nThrough these steps, 20 fractions of testicular cells are collected.\nLoad testicular cells in 1 mL of 0.5% BSA to the wall of column slowly over 0.5% BSA using serological pipettes (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nStand for 150 min at 20°C–25°C.\nOpen the valve at the bottom of column so that the flow rate is 2 mL/min.\nCollect fractions per 4 mL.",
    "Centrifuge all fractions with 1,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min.\nDiscard supernatant and pipette cell pellets with HBSS (1×) 1 mL.\nObserve cells in each fraction with a microscope.\nFollowing centrifugation with 1,000 × g at 4°C for 3 min, store cell pellet at −80°C."
