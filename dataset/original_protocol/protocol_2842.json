Some cell lines yield cell spheroids smaller than 100 μm diameter. This will slow down spontaneous sedimentation. In this case, the spin-down procedure is recommended.\nStage 1: Definitive endoderm differentiation – Day 0–3\nTiming: 3 days\nCell media are changed into Stage 1 medium after 5 h to induce definitive endoderm differentiation. Collect an aliquot of Stage 1 end cells for immunocytochemistry or real-time PCR analyses to examine the expression level of the definitive endoderm marker (ex. SOX17).\nCollect cell spheroids from one well into a 15 mL tube using a 5 mL serological pipette and spin down at 190 g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and wash the cells with 5 mL of PBS (+).",

A portion of Stage 3 end cells can be collected for immunocytochemistry or real-time PCR analyses. The cells will be tested for pancreatic progenitor markers and PDX1 or SOX9 expression levels.",

Stage 4 end cells will contain a majority of the PDX1/NKX6-1 double-positive cell population.\nCollect cell spheroids from one well into a 15 mL tube using a 5 mL serological pipette and spin down at 190 g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell spheroids with 5 mL of Stage 4 medium and move the cells into a new 6-well suspension culture plate.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C, 5% CO2 with 95 rpm (0.13 × g) agitation on an orbital shaker.\nPerform medium change every other day by replacing 90% of spent media with Stage 4 medium.\nAlternatives: Spin down procedure can be changed to spontaneous sedimentation.\nStage 5: Endocrine cell differentiation – Day 13–20\nTiming: 8 days\nThis stage is to generate INS/NKX6-1 expressing endocrine cells.\nCollect cell spheroids from one well into a 15 mL tube using a 5 mL serological pipette and spin down at 190 g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant.",
