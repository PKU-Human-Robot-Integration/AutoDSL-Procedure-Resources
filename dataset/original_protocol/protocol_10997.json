    "The joint ethics committee (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee) of the Hebrew University (Jerusalem, Israel) and Hadassah Medical Center (Jerusalem, Israel) approved the study protocol for animal welfare (MD-18-15417-5 \"Tissue dynamics in pancreatic cancer in mice\"), and the protocol presented here complied with all relevant ethical regulations for animal testing and research. The Hebrew University is an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International-accredited institute.\nNOTE: The mouse strain stock #007908, stock #019378, and stock #008179 were obtained from Jackson's laboratory. PRT (Kras+/LSL-G12D; Ptf1a-CreER; Rosa26LSL-tdTomato) mice were created by crossing the above strains. Mice from both genders, between 6 weeks and 15 months of age, were used for the study. Tamoxifen was prepared by dissolving the powder in corn oil. Adult mice (6-8 weeks of age, females and males), were injected with tamoxifen subcutaneously on days 0 and 2 at a dose of 400 mg/kg and examined twice a week following the injection. It was not possible to measure tumors as they were internally located; therefore, euthanasia was performed if abnormal clinical signs were observed according to the ethical protocol. Mice were euthanized at different time points post-tamoxifen induction, using isoflurane and cervical dislocation.\n1. Pancreatic dissection\nNOTE: For optimal yield during extraction and to ensure good cell viability, rapid dissection is critical. To shorten the time required for pancreas isolation, all instruments and equipment must be ready on ice before euthanizing the mouse.\nEuthanize the mouse by CO2 asphyxiation and verify using cervical dislocation. From this step on, all procedures must be performed with sterile dissecting instruments.\nFix the mouse and spray the abdomen with 70% ethanol. Make a V-shaped incision of 2.5 cm in the genital area with scissors and forceps and proceed upward to fully open the abdominal cavity.",
    "Locate the stomach on the left side of the mouse. Locate the pancreas, which is near the spleen. Separate the pancreas from the stomach and duodenum using two forceps (without tearing). Continue and separate the pancreas from the small intestine, jejunum, and ileum.\nMove the pancreas to the right side of the mouse. Separate the remaining connections between the pancreas and the thoracic cavity with forceps to completely detach the pancreas and attached spleen.\nRemove the pancreas and spread it out for examination in a Petri dish on ice.\n\tNOTE: Care must be taken during this step to remove only the pancreas, and not remove mesenteric fat tissue or other adjacent tissue along with the pancreas, to avoid cellular contamination.\n2. Enzymatic and mechanical dissociation of the pancreas\nPrepare the following buffers in advance.\n\t\nDissociation buffer 1: 4 mL of trypsin C + 6 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (see Table 1) for each sample.\nDissociation buffer 2: 9 mL of Hanks′ balanced salt solution (HBSS) 1x; 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA); 1 mL of collagenase P (10 mg/mL); 200 µL of trypsin inhibitor (10 mg/mL); and 200 µL of DNase I (10 mg/mL) (see Table 1).\nWash buffer: 50 mL of HBSS 1x; 2 g of BSA; 1 mL of trypsin inhibitor (10 mg/mL); and 1 mL of DNase 1 (10 mg/mL).\nEnzyme activity stop solution: HBSS 1x containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 150 g of DNase I (0.2 mg/mL).\nPlace the pancreas in a 50 mL tube on ice. Rinse the pancreas in 10% FBS in HBSS 1x. The fatty tissue will float and the pancreas will sink. This is an easy way to visualize and quickly remove the contaminating white adipose tissue still attached to the pancreas.",
    "Transfer the mouse pancreatic tissue to a sterile Petri dish containing 5 mL of HBSS 1x on ice. Cut the pancreas into small pieces of 1 to 3 mm3 using Noyes scissors and a scalpel (Figure 2A). In case of more than one sample, the samples should be kept on ice in 10% FBS/HBSS 1x.\nTransfer the tissues to a centrifuge tube. Centrifuge at 350 x g at 4 °C for 5 min. Aspirate and discard the supernatant to remove cell fragments and blood cells.\nResuspend the pieces in dissociation buffer 1 containing 0.02% trypsin C-0.05% EDTA for 10 min at 37 °C with agitation (180 rpm). Immediately wash with 10% FBS/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). Centrifuge for 5 min at 350 g at 4 °C.\nWash again by resuspending the pellet in 10 mL of wash buffer and centrifuging at 350 x g for 5 min at 4 °C before the next dissociation step.\nIncubate the pancreas in dissociation buffer 2 for 15 min at 37 °C with agitation (180 rpm).\nAfter 15 min, perform mechanical dissociation by vigorously pipetting the pancreatic fragments up and down in sterile pipettes of decreasing size (25, 10, and 5 mL serological pipettes) 10 times and bring back to 37 °C.\n\t\nAfter an additional 5 min, repeat the mechanical dissociation and use light microscopy to monitor the dissociation according to the amount of single-cell suspension. Usually if at this stage, less than 90% of the suspension consists of isolated single cells, a longer incubation time is needed. Use trypan blue to monitor cell viability.\nContinue with the incubation and take samples to detect the dissociation every 5 min.",
    "NOTE: The total incubation time depends on the tissue and can vary between samples. The incubation and tissue dissociation should end when 90% of the cells are separated into single cells or when a reduction in viability is detected.\nAfter the pancreatic tissue is well dissociated (corresponding to the disappearance of pancreatic fragments and the increasing turbidity of the solution) (Figure 2), stop the enzymatic reaction by washing twice with enzyme activity stop solution for 5 min at 4 °C. From this step, keep the cell suspension on ice.\nPass the cell suspension through a 70µm nylon mesh and check the cell viability under the microscope. Smaller sizes of nylon mesh may reduce cell viability.\nResuspend and wash the pellet with 5-10 mL of ice-cold buffered wash solution. Count the cells.\nIf several red blood cells are observed, treat the cells with a red blood cell lysis buffer for 2 min at room temperature. In cases where clumps are observed, the sample should be treated again with trypsin, as described in step 2.5. Viability is detected with trypan blue under the microscope, and if viability is less than 80%, live cells should be isolated using the magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) dead cells removal kit with MACS MS columns (see Table 1).\nSubscription Required.
