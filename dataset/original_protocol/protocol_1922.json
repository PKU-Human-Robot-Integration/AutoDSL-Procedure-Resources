    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSeeding and transfection of HBECs\nTiming: 3 days\nSeeding of HBECs prior to transfection:\nHarvest HBECs as described in steps 9 (a–e) of the “cell culture of HBECs before transfection[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.6]” section above.\nCount cells using a Neubauer glass chamber.\nSeed ∼8 × 104 cells in each well of a 6-well plate containing 2 mL keratinocyte medium to subsequently transfect the cells with the gRNA/Cas9 expressing vectors.\nTwo days after plating, the keratinocyte medium is replenished and double transfection with the gRNA/Cas9 expressing vectors can be performed. HBECs are transfected with 1.5–2.5 μg of each plasmid DNA using the FuGENE ® HD Transfection Reagent (#E2311).\nPrepare the Transfection reagent: DNA mixture in a tube using a 4:1 FuGENE® HD Transfection Reagent: DNA ratio, and add the mixture in 200 μL Opti-MEM (#11058021). For example, 3 μg of total plasmid DNA mixed with 12 μL FuGENE are added in 200 μL Opti-MEM.\nResuspend by thorough pipetting and incubate for 15 min at 15°C–22°C.\nAdd the mixture dropwise in each transfection well containing 2 mL keratinocyte medium, in antibiotic- and serum-free conditions.\nCritical: Avoid using antibiotics in the transfection medium, as they may reduce the HBEC transfection efficiency due to increased cellular stress.\nNote: Use only one gRNA per breakpoint per transfection.\nNote: Other adherent cell lines which are normally cultured in the presence of serum (e.g., Li-Fraumeni) can easily be transfected using serum-containing medium, as serum does not interfere with the FuGENE reagent.\nAfter 24 h, HBECs can be harvested to assess plasmid expression and/or used in downstream analyses.\nCritical: To minimize stress and achieve high co-transfection efficiency up to 35%, transfect HBECs (or other challenging cell lines) at a confluency of ∼80% (i.e., two days after seeding cells at the density indicated in step 1c.",
    "Single-cell sorting by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)\nTiming: 1 day\nFollowing transfection, HBECs are subjected to FACS sorting:\n24 h after transfection, trypsinize and collect HBECs as described in steps 9a–9d of the “cell culture of HBECs before transfection[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.6]” section.\nWash once with 1× PBS and spin down at 500 × g for 5 min at 15°C–22°C.\nAfter discarding the supernatant, resuspend the cell pellet in 500 μL Opti-MEM or Keratinocyte medium and keep on ice until sorting.\nNote: Cellular viability can be estimated by adding 4′,6-Diamidino-2-Phenylindole (DAPI) (at a final concentration of 500–1,000 ng/mL) into a portion of the transfected cells resuspended in 500 μL 1× PBS, directly before sorting. Only the DNA of non-viable cells is stained by DAPI due to the inability of DAPI to pass through intact cell membranes of living cells. In the case of HBECs the percentage of dead cells was estimated at 4%–7% of the population.\nPerform single-cell sorting of the cell suspension using a flow cytometer (BD FACS Aria III). Adjust the settings such that only double-positive single cells expressing both GFP and mCherry (GFP+/mCherry+) will be sorted.\nPrepare 96-well plates (#650180) for cell sorting, by adding in each well 100 μL keratinocyte medium supplemented with 1% Pen/Strep to avoid contamination during FACS. Prepare at least 4 × 96-well plates.\nSort cells by plating one cell per well of a 96-well plate.\nCritical: Given that the percentage of single cells surviving after single cell sorting is very low (approximately 30%), it is crucial to fill as many 96-well plates as possible, as this will facilitate the screening procedure and minimize experimental risk.\nPropagation of clones\nTiming: 3–4 weeks\nHBECs that survived after seeding into 96-well plates as single cells will gradually start proliferating, giving rise to separate clones in each well.",
    "Allow single cell cultures to recover by incubating undisturbed in humid 37°C/5% CO2 chamber for 7 days after FACS.\nAdd 100 μL antibiotic-free keratinocyte medium and start monitoring the clones under the microscope.\nReplenish the medium every week: Remove carefully the medium from each well using a 100 μL pipette or a multi-channel pipette, trying not to touch the bottom and slowly add 100 μL fresh Keratinocyte medium.\nOnce single cell-derived clones reach full confluency, the screening procedure can commence.\nNote: The use of a multi-channel pipette is highly recommended for easier and faster handling of the clones.\nScreening for inverted clone validation\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nDNA is first extracted from each clone separately and the presence of the inversion is queried via PCR.\nFor quick preparation of genomic DNA (Charette and Cosson, 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]):\nAfter aspirating the medium and washing once with 1× PBS, harvest the cells derived from each well of the 96-well plates by adding 30 μL Trypsin/EDTA 1× and incubating for 5 min at 37°C.\nAdd an equal or larger volume of Trypsin Neutralizer Solution and resuspend thoroughly by pipetting.\nFor each clonal culture, transfer half of the amount of solution containing the trypsinized cells in a new well of a 96-well plate containing 200 μL (or more) of keratinocyte medium.\nCritical: For HBECs and other sensitive cell lines which normally require centrifugation for total trypsin removal, the addition of a larger amount of medium (≥ 200 μl) in the new 96-well plates will yield equivalent results in regards to propagation.\nLyse the cells which were not transferred into new 96-well plates by directly adding 30 μL of Quick Lysis Buffer (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section above) and transfer the lysate in an Eppendorf tube.",
    "Heat for 45 min at 60°C, followed by 10 min at 80°C for Proteinase K inactivation.\nThe lysate contains the genomic DNA, and 4 μL of the lysate can be used directly as template for PCR.\nThe rest of the lysate can be stored at −20°C for 1–2 weeks or −80°C for long-term storage.\nFor the screening process:\nSet up the PCR reactions using F1/F2 and R1/R2 primers (each pair in a separate reaction) to verify the presence of the inversion and exclude “non-inverted” clones. Set up the reaction for each clone as described below:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1518_7.csv\nCritical: Before screening, it is essential that PCR conditions are optimized for the set of primers used. It is recommended to first use the F1/R1 and F2/R2 primer combinations on wild-type genomic DNA template, which should result in an unambiguous PCR product corresponding to the wild-type alleles. For guidance regarding the design of primers for efficient targeting, please refer to the “design of primers for identifying the inversion[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2]” section above.\nRun the reactions in a 1.3% agarose gel (for recipe see Table in the “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]” section prepared with SYBR Safe DNA gel stain (#S33102). The clones yielding a PCR product (at ∼770 bp and ∼1,300 bp for F1/F2 and R1/R2, respectively, in our experimental setup) harbor at least one inverted allele (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1518-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Validation of the engineered inversion through PCR",
    "(A and B) Agarose gel images representing: (A) PCR screening of CRISPR-Cas9-engineered clones using F1+F2 primers. Clone 13 possibly harbors the desired inversion. (B) Identification of heterozygosity regarding the inversion; F1+R1: amplification of wild-type product at 921 bp, F2+R2: amplification of wild-type product at 1,100 bp, F3+R3: amplification of the BHLHE40 gene located between the breakpoint sites at 856 bp, F1+F2: amplification of inverted breakpoint 1 region at ∼770 bp, R1+R2: amplification of inverted breakpoint 2 region at ∼1,300 bp. The presence of bands for both wild-type and inverted regions in the same clones indicates heterozygosity.\nTo assess heterozygosity, run PCR reactions as described in step 6a on the same clones, this time using the F1/R1 and F2/R2 primer combinations (again, each primer combination in a separate reaction). Amplification with these sets of primers will reveal the presence of a wild-type allele in addition to the inverted one previously identified, which indicates heterozygosity (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). Absence of amplification using the F1/R1 and F2/R2 primer combinations indicates homozygosity regarding the inversion.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1518_8.csv\nTo conclusively validate the engineering of the desired inverted area, PCR products should be first purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (#28104, https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/download.aspx?id=95f10677-aa29-453d-a222-0e19f01ebe17&lang=en[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/download.aspx?id=95f10677-aa29-453d-a222-0e19f01ebe17&lang=en]) and submitted for Sanger sequencing using the F1 or F2 primer for the inverted breakpoint 1 and R1 or R2 for the inverted breakpoint 2.\nNote: The inversion occurs at low frequency after CRISPR-Cas9 editing (<1.5% in HBECs), therefore a large number of clones should be screened via PCR to identify the few ones harboring the inversion.\nPropagation of the inverted clones\nTiming: 2–3 weeks",
    "The clones identified as “inverted” should be gradually expanded in the case of HBECs or other sensitive cell lines. Specifically, cells should be initially transferred from each well of a 96-well plate to a well of a 24-well plate and then to a 12-well plate before the cells can be safely transferred to a 6-well plate. This is an essential step to avoid additional stress of the cells growing in the presence of Trypsin/EDTA and Neutralizer (see step 5c in the “screening for inverted clone validation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4]” section), which cannot be directly removed, as centrifugation of such a small pellet is not recommended at this critical step, to prevent cell loss.\nCritical: HBECs should be transferred to larger wells only upon reaching confluency, as sub-confluent HBEC cultures exhibit lower viability and propagate at a slower rate."
