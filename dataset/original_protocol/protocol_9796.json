    "No living animals were involved in this study. The experiment was performed on an ex vivo model consisting of a porcine esophagus and stomach. The stomach and esophagus were purchased from a local butchery as their standard product. This procedure is in accordance with Czech laws, and we prefer it because of the \"3R\" principle (Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement).\n1. Fabrication of the pH sensor assembly\nNOTE: Observe precautions for handling electrostatic discharge (ESD) sensitive components throughout the fabrication of the pH sensor assembly. Be careful when working with the soldering iron.\nPlace the ISFET pH sensor mounted on a printed circuit board (PCB) on a flat surface. Locate the solderable contacts.\nTrim the solderable contacts, so their length is no longer than 3 mm.\nSolder a 15 mm section of fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) coated cable to the solderable electrodes of the pH sensor. Do not mechanically or chemically clean the bare die assembly. Try to avoid contamination of the die and PCB with flux during soldering.\nInspect the pH sensor-cable assembly under a microscope for open circuits and shorts. Then, check the shorts with an open-short tester. A correctly prepared assembly at this stage is shown in Figure 1.\nClean the pH sensor assembly in an ultrasonic cleaner for 5 min at 70 °C in a 5% solution of flux remover in water. The optimum range of ultrasound power is 50-100 W/l. Do not exceed 100 W/l.\nRinse the pH sensor assembly in technical grade isopropyl alcohol for at least 3 min and let it dry in an oven at 80 °C for 15 min.\nPlace all pH sensors on a flat surface (in case multiple are prepared simultaneously) before proceeding to the next step.",
    "Mix an appropriate amount of two-part epoxy for encapsulation of the soldered electrodes. Use a minimum of 2 mL to allow thorough mixing. Use black opaque epoxy to allow for inspection later- parts of the sensor exposed to the environment will be seen easier as they will not have opaque epoxy on them\nTransfer the mixed epoxy to a 1 mL syringe with a 0.5 mm flat end needle.\nCoat the soldering area of pH sensors with epoxy. Make sure to coat the whole area of PCB electrodes and the exposed wire.\nLet the epoxy cure either at room or elevated temperature (80 °C max), for this study 50 °C was used with the epoxy listed in the Table of Materials.\nInspect the coated area under a microscope. If any uncoated metal parts (either PCB electrode or wire) are exposed, repeat steps 1.8-1.11 until there are no visual signs of uncoated metal.\nTrim the wires to the length and angle shown in Figure 2. Coat the ends with solder to avoid fraying.\n2. Fabrication of the electronic assembly\nNOTE: Observe precautions for handling ESD-sensitive components throughout the fabrication of the electronics. Be careful when working with the soldering iron and hot-air gun.\nPlace the PCB (manufactured based on the supplementary files \"pcb1.zip\" and schematic diagram \"schematic.png\") on a flat surface, components side up.\nApply solder paste to all the exposed gold-plated pads.\nPlace all passive and active components using tweezers according to Figure 3 and the Table of Materials.",
    "Heat the PCB with the hot air gun to solder the components. Heat the PCB gradually to 150 °C for 2 min to expel residual water from the packages and activate the flux in the solder paste. Then, heat the PCB to 260 °C to solder the components. Let the PCB cool to room temperature, do not move it during the whole soldering process.\nAfter soldering and cooling down to room temperature, inspect the PCB under a microscope to verify the correct placement of all the components and shorts. If no shorts or incorrect component placement is observed, skip step 2.6.\nRepair any shorts or incorrect component placement with a soldering gun or hot air gun. Go to step 2.5.\nSolder 5 wires to the components (power and programming leads) as shown in Figure 4.\nTo connect the PCB to the programmer, connect the wires soldered in step 2.7. to the connector of the programmer.\nProgram firmware (see Representative Results for a detailed explanation of which file to use) to the microcontroller. Use the previously described procedure to set up the programming software19. Set the programmer to power the device with a voltage of approximately 2.5 V. De-solder the 5 wires after programming.\nPlace the PCB on a flat surface, component side up. Solder the AWG38 copper antenna wire (length of 3 cm) as shown in Figure 5 and wrap it around the edge of the PCB. Fix the antenna wire to the edge of the PCB with a cyanoacrylate adhesive. Solder the other two wire jumpers with SWG38 copper wire as shown in Figure 5. Avoid electrical contact with other components.\nPut the PCB on a flat surface, component side down.\nSolder two battery holders to the opposite part of PCB, as shown in Figure 6.",
    "Solder the pH sensor assembly to the terminals on the PCB, as shown in Figure 7.\nInsert two AG1 batteries into the battery holders.\n\tNOTE: Do not proceed with this step and next steps in this section earlier than 24 h before testing and endoscopic implantation of the sensor.\nPrepare an appropriate amount of epoxy as described in step 1.8. for encapsulation of the device.\nEncapsulate the device with the epoxy using the same procedure described in step 1.9 (syringe with a needle). Let the epoxy cure at room temperature or slightly elevated temperature (do not exceed 50 °C because of the presence of batteries). See Figure 8 for the correct encapsulation results.\nCreate a titanium wire hook according to Figure 9.\n\tNOTE: Titanium (Grade II) was chosen because of its biocompatibility and track record of use in implantable medical devices. Stainless steel may be used, too. However, the type and heat treatment must be chosen carefully as some stainless steel types are very brittle.\nAttach the wire hook to the device with a drop of fast-curing epoxy (see Figure 10) and let it cure at room temperature or slightly elevated temperature (50 °C maximum). The pH sensor is located on the bottom left side of the implantable device.\nThe sensor becomes activated 24 h after the insertion of the batteries. Meanwhile, proceed with step 3.\n\t​NOTE: Pause the protocol now if completion of step 3 within 24 h after insertion of the batteries is possible.\n3. Fabrication of passive rectenna receiver\nPlace the PCB (manufactured based on the supplementary file \"pcb2.zip\"). for the rectenna on a flat surface.\nSolder the components using the solder paste method described in steps 2.2-2.6 or use a soldering gun according to Figure 11A.",
    "NOTE: If the experimenter decides to manufacture the rectenna receiver again (it was previously manufactured and matched) or does not want to proceed with receiver matching, use the values of the components previously determined by the experimenter or provided in Figure 11B and skip steps 3.5-3.7.\nSolder the SMA connector to the PCB.\nInspect the PCB under a microscope. If any shorts or incorrect component placement is observed, fix the issues.\nAttach a vector network analyzer input to the SMA connector.\nRecord the S11 Smith chart of the rectenna from 300-500 MHz with 1 kHz resolution bandwidth. Observe the response and record the impedance at 431.7 MHz. Use an impedance matching calculator software to determine the values of matching components. The sample Smith chart is shown in Figure 12A.\nSolder the impedance matching components and inspect under a microscope for short circuits and component placement.\nMeasure with spectrum analyzer again and confirm that the voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) is under 3 between 300-500 MHz (inside the outer cyan circle shown in Figure 12B). If not, either repeat with different matching components or continue with the reduced performance of the rectenna in mind.\nConnect the 433 MHz band antenna to the SMA connector. Connect an oscilloscope to the rectenna output.\nSet the oscilloscope to single-channel operation, rolling time base, DC mode, 500 ms/div time base, and 5 mV/div voltage scale.\n4. Testing of the device\nNOTE: The following steps require the use of chemicals. Study the material safety data sheets of the chemicals beforehand and use proper protective equipment and common lab practices when manipulating them.",
    "Inspect the output of the sensor by observing the signal shown on the oscilloscope. The sample output is shown in Figure 13,14. The device will be active after 24 h past the insertion of the batteries. The period of transmitting the output of the pH sensor varies depending on the file which was programmed to the microcontroller (see Representative Results for a detailed explanation).\nPrepare 2% hydrochloric acid solution (use caution when handling hydrochloric acid). Prepare 100 mM buffer solutions of pH 4 (potassium hydrogen phthalate/hydrochloric acid), pH 7 (potassium dihydrogen phosphate/sodium hydroxide), and pH 10 (sodium carbonate/sodium hydrogen carbonate) using standard laboratory procedures and mark the beakers.\nVerify the pH of all four beakers using a calibrated pH meter. Adjust if needed.\nSubmerge the capsule in every beaker and record at least 3 samples. Measure the period between the second and third pulse and fill it in the provided spreadsheet (Supplemental File 1). Determine the calibration coefficients for the pH sensor using the spreadsheet.\nAfter calibration, measure the time between the second and the third pulse and input it into the spreadsheet to determine the pH of the solution to which the pH sensor is exposed.\n5. Endoscopic implantation of the sensor\nPrepare an ex vivo endoscopic porcine model made up of the stomach and a long segment of the esophagus.\nGrasp the sensor externally with a hemostatic clip, as shown in Figure 15 and Figure 16.\nInsert the endoscope with the sensor in the clip in the standard way into the model.\nPosition the clip with the sensor close to the lower esophageal sphincter.",
    "Rotate the endoscope against the esophageal wall, open the clip and then push toward the esophageal wall. Close the clip and release the clip. The sensor will remain attached to the esophageal wall at the desired location, as shown in Figure 17D and Figure 17E.\nExtract the endoscope.\n6. Experiment after implantation\nNOTE: The following steps require the use of chemicals. Study the material safety data sheets of the chemicals beforehand and use proper protective equipment and common lab practices when manipulating them.\nPlace the receiver within 10 cm (maximum) of the implanted sensor.\nInject 50 mL of the solutions with various pH values into the esophagus, as shown in Figure 18, and observe the changes in the sensor's response. Retract the endoscope after every injection and read the value no earlier than 30 s after injection. Wash the esophagus with 100 mL of deionized water between injecting solutions with different pH.\nUse the spreadsheet (Supplemental File 1) to calculate the pH measured by the sensor.\nSubscription Required.
