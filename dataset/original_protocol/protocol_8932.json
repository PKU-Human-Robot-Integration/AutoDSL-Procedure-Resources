    "1. Stain the Preparation with Supravital Dyes\nFor the garter snake dissection protocol see Stewart et al.5 and Teng et al.6 Reptilian tissue remains physiological for longer times, and with less bacterial contamination, when kept at low temperatures (see below). Mammalian tissue is usually maintained at room temperature or higher.\nFor lysosomal vital dye staining, dissolve the dye in cold reptilian Ringers solution 1:5,000 (0.2 μM). Incubate at 4 °C for 15 min. Wash several times with cold Ringers. Image as soon as possible.\nFor FM1-43 staining using KCl stimulation, dilute the dye in high-KCl Ringers 1:500 (7 μM). Incubate at 4 °C for 30-60 sec maximum. Wash quickly three times with cold Ringers, ~1 min/rinse. Image as soon as possible.\nFor FM1-43 staining using hypertonic (sucrose) stimulation, dilute the dye in 0.5 M sucrose Ringers as above. Incubate at 4 °C for 2-5 min. Wash as in step 1.3 above with cold Ringers. Image as soon as possible.\nFor FM1-43 staining via electrical stimulation, see Teng et al.6 Briefly, the preparation is placed a dish containing physiological saline solution and the dye. The nerve is stimulated with a preprogrammed train of 200 μsec rectangular pulses ( ~7 V, 30 Hz, 18 μsec). Wash as in step 1.3 above with cold Ringers. Image as soon as possible.\n2. Configure the Preparation for Imaging\nOrient the preparation so that structures of interest are as close as possible to the microscope objective.",
    "If an inverted microscope is used, utilize a chamber whose bottom contains a thin round cover slip. Typically, the imaging chamber should have a thin stainless steel bottom with a 25 mm diameter #1 thickness glass cover slip at the center. If an upright microscope is used, a bottom coverslip is not required but is useful to permit imaging with transmitted light (e.g. differential interference contrast, DIC) to orient the specimen and locate objects of interest.\nChoose an appropriate objective to obtain the highest possible 3D resolution. There are tradeoffs among numerical aperture (n.a.), working distance, magnification, and type of lens (dry, water- and oil-immersion). For thin preparations like tissue cultures, oil objectives are best. Using an upright microscope, float a cover slip on the aqueous bath, and use immersion oil between the top of the cover slip and the objective.\nIf deconvolution software is used, the vendor might provide predetermined point spread functions (PSFs) for certain objectives. If no such information is provided, or if an unsupported objective is chosen, determine the PSF by imaging fluorescent microdots or similar diffraction-limited objects7,8.\n3. Establish the Desired Depth of Field and Number of Images Desired per Time-lapse Frame\nSelect the total depth of field so that moving or interacting structures of interest do not disappear or go out of focus as they move in the z-direction. The z-field should slightly exceed the vertical dimension of the cell or cell process being imaged. For vertebrate motor terminals, 15-20 µm is typical.",
    "Calculate the z-axis step needed for each increment of focus. Resolution along the z-axis varies depending upon properties of the objective; it is about one-fourth of the x-y plane resolution. If either confocal imaging or deconvolution software is used, z-axis resolution is improved. Improve final resolution by deliberate oversampling in the z-direction 5, but see also step 3.3 below. A typical step interval is in the range from 400-1,500 nm for 40-100X objectives. Light should be shuttered off between each z-step image.\nSelect the number of images per z-stack, namely the desired depth of field divided by the step interval. Time to complete a typical z-stack is 1-10 sec. Fast-moving objects (100 nm/sec) can appear blurred in a 3D image stack because each image plane corresponds to a slightly different time point. Also, each additional image contributes to photobleaching and possible phototoxicity (see Discussion). If either situation pertains, choose a larger z-step to collect fewer images per stack. Compensate later using image interpolation software (step 6.3 below).\n4. Select the Time-lapse Frame Rate\nChoose by experimentation a rate that is just adequate to smoothly resolve changes with time such as movement, interactions or fusion events9. Under sampling can produce motion artifacts (sampling errors), while oversampling unnecessarily increases exposure to light. Collect either a single long sequence or several repeated sequences from the same preparation, each with a relatively small total time interval (e.g. 10 time points x 30 sec interval = 5 min). If possible, view the preparation with continuous epifluorescence illumination to roughly estimate movement velocities, including drift of the entire preparation if present.\n5. Complete All Live Imaging for a Particular Preparation\nReptilian preparations typically remain robust for ~1-2 hr, longer if cooled.\n6. Analyze Data According to Desired Use",
    "Retain all raw data files. While digital storage is usually not a problem, processing time is significant even with fast personal computers or workstations. For this reason, crop images into a region of interest [ROI]. Assure that the entire region of interest is in the cropped window during the entire time course.\nDeconvolve image stacks using appropriate software and the correct point spread function. Confirm that resolution is improved and that no artifact has been generated by the deconvolution algorithm. Figure 3 shows example images.\nUse an interpolation algorithm to expand z-axis apparent resolution. A 6X expansion from an actual 1.5 μm image plane separation to an apparent 0.25 μm separation is suggested. Alternatively, use some combination of oversampling (step 3.2) and interpolation.\nPerform contrast, brightness, noise filtering, photobleaching and other typical image processing adjustments if desired. Image manipulation standards dictate that for most scientific work, it is appropriate that the same corrections be applied to all images, both within a stack and at different time points. The consequence of a particular adjustment should be assessed among all images 9.\nSelect a particular display mode for export of data. The most straightforward display is stereo video using either red-green or red-blue anaglyphs (examples in Figure 3), stereo pairs, or alternating left/right eye frames with shutter glasses. Anaglyphs are limited to single-color. Enhance apparent image depth if desired to improve z-axis visual resolution.\nExperiment with various filtering and image enhancement techniques. For example, Laplacian filtering is useful to increase contrast of small structures above background. The brightness of pixels at the center of a running window is enhanced while brightness of surrounding areas is reduced. Note that some filtering methods do not work well in combination.",
    "Apply drift correction if there is substantial movement of the preparation over time. Such movement is common in living muscle, even with drugs added to suppress action potentials and synaptic potentials. A pixel registration algorithm (e.g. IMARIS, Adobe AfterEffects, TurboReg plugin for ImageJ) aligns time-lapse images and can reduce, but usually not completely eliminate, such motion.\nSubscription Required.
