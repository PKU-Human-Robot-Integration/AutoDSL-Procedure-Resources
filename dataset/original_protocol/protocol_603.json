Sacrifice two 8-16 week old reprogrammable mice/Oct4GFP mice by ventilating them with CO<sup>2</sup>.\n  2. Aseptically remove femurs and tibiae.",
    "3. Use scissors to remove all tissues from the bones.\n  4. Crush the bones in a mortar in 10 ml of labeling buffer.\n  5. Thoroughly resuspend the cells by pipetting them up and down.\n  6. Filter the cells with a 40μm cell strainer in a 50 ml conical tube. \n  7. Centrifuge the cells for 5 minutes at 300xg, resuspend them in fresh labeling buffer and count them in a hemocytometer.\n  8. Resuspend the cells in labeling buffer to a final concentration of 10X10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml.\n  9. Add Fc-block to the cell suspension at a concentration of 0.1μg/10<sup>6</sup> cells and incubate for 10 minutes on ice.\n  10. Add CD19-biotin conjugated antibody \\(0.2ug/10<sup>6</sup> cells) and incubate for 20 minutes on ice.\n  11. Wash the cells with 10ml of labeling buffer, centrifuge for 5 minutes at 300xg. Resuspend them in 90μl of labeling buffer and 10μl of Streptavidin beads per 10 x10<sup>6</sup> cells and incubate for 20 minutes on ice.\n  12. Wash the cells with 10ml of labeling buffer and proceed with purification using the MACS LS column.\n  13. Place the LS column in the MACS separator.\n  14. Wash the column with labeling buffer.\n  15. Pipette 500μl of cells in the LS column allowing the suspension to run through and collect the effluent as negative fraction \\(this fraction is enriched for myeloid progenitors).\n  16. Wash the column with 3ml of labeling buffer.\n  17 Repeat STEP 17 three times.\n18. Remove the column from the MACS separator and place it in a new 15ml collection tube.\n  19. Apply 5ml of labeling buffer and firmly flush out the cells using the plunger provided. This yields the CD19 positive B cell fraction.\n  \n**Reprogramming of Bells**\n_Retrovirus Production and B Cell Infection_",
    "1. Two days before viral transduction seed 9x10<sup>6</sup> PlatE cells \\(Cell Biolabs) into two 10cm dishes. To detach PlatE cells wash the cells once with PBS and then add 1-3ml of TrypLE select cell dissociation reagent. After 3-5 minutes at 37°C add PlatE medium and count the cells in the hemocytometer.\n  2. The following morning transfect PlatE cells with 20μg of C/EBP-ER-hCD4 plasmid using the calcium phosphate protocol. \n  3. Replace the transfection medium after 8 hours with 6 ml of fresh B cell medium per 10cm plate. Culture the cells at 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator.\n  4. After 18-20 hours of culture at 37°C collect the supernatant, filter it using a 0.45μm sterile filter, add 10ng/ml of IL-7 and use the filtered medium to infect the B cells. Use 2ml of supernatant to infect 2X10<sup>6</sup> B cells per well of a 6-weel plate. Add 6 ml of fresh B cell medium to the PlatE cells. Place the cells in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator.\n  5. 24 hours later collect the supernatant of the PlatE cells and use it to infect the B cells a second time.\n  \n_Plating of B cells on S17 Stromal Cells_\nWe use S17 stromal cells for the first days of B cell expansion before the reprogramming is initiated. \n1. The day of the viral transduction experiment prepare gelatin-coated dishes. Then plate Mitomycin C inactivated S17 cells at a density of 3X10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> onto 10cm plates. To detach S17 cells, wash the cells with PBS and add the adequate amount of TrypLE select cell dissociation reagent to the cells. After 3-5 minutes, add S17 medium and count the cells in the hemocytometer.",
    "2. Collect the infected B cells from the 6 well plate and centrifuge them at 300xg for 5 min. Then aspirate the supernatant, and resuspend the cells in 10 ml of B cell medium. Plate the B cells on the inactivated S17 cells. \n  3. Grow the cells 4 days or until they reach confluence \\(note that besides B cells that remain non-adherent, many of them move under the feeders, forming clusters of flattened cells with smooth edges that can easily be distinguished from the feeder cells).\n  4. Collect the B cells, stain them with human CD4 antibody and sort hCD4<sup>+</sup> transgene containing cells using a MACS column or a fluorescence activated cell sorter.\n  5. The day before the sorting prepare gelatin-coated 12 well dishes. Plate Mitomycin C inactivated MEF cells at a density of 3X10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. To detach MEF cells add the adequate amount of TrypLE select cell dissociation reagent. After 3-5 minutes, add S17/MEF medium and count the cells in the hemocytometer.\n  6. After the sorting of the hCD4<sup>+</sup> B cells, count the cells using the desired method and seed the cells on MEF feeders at a density of 25.000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. Let the cells grow for two days.\n  7. To activate C/EBPa add β-estradiol at a concentration of 100nM to the B cell medium.\n  8. After 18h collect the supernatant and carefully wash the cultures twice with 500μl of PBS. Then centrifuge the supernatant/PBS at 300xg for 5 min.\n  9. Resuspend the pellet in fresh reprogramming medium containing 2ug/ml of doxycycline and re-seed the cells into the original wells. \n  10. Gently replace the medium every two days. \n  11. Starting at day 1 Oct4GFP positive cells can be observed under a fluorescence microscope or recorded by FACS.",
    "12. After 2 days supplement the reprogramming medium with 20%KSR, 3uM CHIR99021 and 1uM PD0325901.\n  13. Starting at day 4 Oct4GFP positive colonies with ES-like morphology appear. \n  13. At day 8 change the medium to reprogramming medium without doxycycline to select transgene-independent iPS cell colonies."
