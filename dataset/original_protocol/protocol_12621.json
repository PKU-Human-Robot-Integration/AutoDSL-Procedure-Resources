  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: Autoclaved distilled and deionized water (ddH2O) is recommended for making buffers and reaction master mixes. Sections 1−4 describe cell lysis and sonication, sections 5−7 describe chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), sections 8−11 describe enzymatic reactions on beads, sections 12 and 13 describe ChIP elution and DNA purification, and sections 14−19 describe library preparation.\n1. Harvesting and crosslinking cells\nAfter differentiating mouse ES cells into postmitotic neurons, add 11% formaldehyde to the harvested cells to a final concentration of 1% (v/v). Rock cells on a rocking platform (a rocker, shaker, or rotator) for 15 min, at room temperature (RT, 25 °C).\n\tNOTE: Depending on the target protein to be crosslinked, less formaldehyde crosslinking (for example, a final concentration of 0.5%) or double crosslinking with disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG) can be used.\nAdd 2.5 M glycine to a final concentration of 150 mM to stop the crosslinking reaction. Rock cells on a rocking platform at RT, for 5 min.\nCentrifuge the crosslinked cells in 15 mL conical tubes at RT, for 6 min, at 1,350 x g. Aspirate the solution, then resuspend cells in 5 mL of 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\n\tNOTE: The crosslinked cell pellets can be stored at -80 °C after flash freezing with liquid nitrogen.\n2. Cell lysis\nNOTE: The following steps in this protocol are for approximately 2 x 107 neuronal cells differentiated from mouse ES cells. To break open cells, lysis buffers containing various detergents will be used. Add 50 µL of 1000x complete protease inhibitor (CPI) stock to 50 mL of buffer just prior to use.\nPrepare lysis buffers 1−3 as described in Table 2.",
    "Thaw crosslinked cell pellets on ice, then thoroughly resuspend cell pellets in 3 mL of lysis buffer 1 in 15 mL conical tubes. Rock at 4 °C for 15 min on a rocking platform. Centrifuge at 1,350 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and aspirate supernatant.\nThoroughly resuspend pelleted cells in 3 mL of lysis buffer 2. Rock at 4 °C for 10 min on a rocking platform. Centrifuge at 1,350 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and aspirate supernatant.\nAdd 1 mL of lysis buffer 3 to each pellet, then keep on ice. Immediately proceed to sonication.\n3. Sonicating chromatin\nNOTE: Keep samples on ice or at 4 °C during this sonication procedure to reduce crosslink reversal.\nUsing a sterile spatula, add sonication beads (Table of Materials) up to the 0.2 mL graduation mark on 15 mL polystyrene tubes. Wash sonication beads by vortexing in 600 µL of 1x PBS until no dry spots are visible. Centrifuge the tubes for 5 s at 30 x g and aspirate 1x PBS.\n\tNOTE: Sonication in polystyrene tubes is more efficient than sonication in polypropylene tubes. If a smaller number of cells (for example, <106 cells) is sonicated, use 1.5 mL polystyrene tubes without adding sonication beads.\nThoroughly resuspend the nuclear lysates in 1 mL of lysis buffer 3 (from step 2.4), then transfer to the 15 mL polystyrene tubes containing sonication beads. Briefly vortex the polystyrene tubes.\nTo fragmentize the crosslinked chromatin DNA, sonicate nuclear lysates at 4 °C for an optimized number of cycles, with power amplitude at 30 W, and sonication cycles set to 30 s on/30 s off.",
    "NOTE: Optimization of sonication for each cell type and batch will result in the best ChIP-exo yield. For 2 x 107 mouse neuronal cells, 20−30 sonication cycles at the mentioned settings will fragment the chromatin in the range of 100−500 bp.\nAfter sonication is complete, transfer all the supernatant (sonicated lysates), from each sample, to 1.5 mL tubes. Add 10% 2-[4-(2,4,4-trimethylpentan-2-yl)phenoxy]ethanol) to each sample at a final concentration of 1%. Mix by pipetting.\nTo pellet cell debris, centrifuge samples at 13,500 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Transfer all the sonicated lysates (supernatant) from each sample to new 1.5 mL tubes.\nTake 30 µL of sonicated lysate from each sample (~3% of sonicated lysate) and add to new 1.5 mL tubes to check sonication. Store remaining sonicated lysates at 4 °C until ready for incubation with antibody-coated beads.\n4. Checking sonication\nMake 20 mL of 2x proteinase K buffer by adding 2 mL of 0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mL of 0.5 M EDTA, 10 mL of 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 6 mL of autoclaved ddH2O. Do not add CPI to this buffer. Store in 50 mL tube at RT.\nTo reverse the protein-DNA crosslink, by removing the proteins, take the 30 µL of sonicated chromatin from each sample (from step 3.6), add 166 µL of autoclaved ddH2O, 200 µL of 2x proteinase K buffer and 4 µL of 20 mg/mL proteinase K. Briefly vortex the samples, and then incubate at 65 °C for 1−3 h at 24 x g.\nNOTE: The sonicated lysates can be reverse crosslinked at 65 °C overnight.\nExtract DNA using PCIA (25:24:1) and ethanol precipitation method as follows.\n\tCAUTION: PCIA is toxic. Use under a fume hood with standard personal protective equipment (PPE).",
    "Add 400 µL of PCIA to each sample in 1.5 mL tubes, set vortex to maximum speed and vortex samples for 20 s. Centrifuge at 18,400 x g for 6 min at RT. Two phases will be observed. Carefully transfer the upper aqueous layer (clear phase) of each sample to new 1.5 mL tubes.\nAdd 1 µL of 10 mg/mL RNase A. Incubate samples at 37 °C for 30 min.\nAdd 1 µL of 20 mg/mL glycogen to each sample, then precipitate with 1 mL of ice-cold 100% ethanol (stored in a -20 °C freezer). Mix briefly, then incubate samples in -80 °C freezer for 30 min to 1 h. Centrifuge samples at 18,400 x g for 10 min at 4 °C and carefully pour out 100% ethanol.\nWash pellets with 500 µL of ice-cold 70% ethanol (stored in a -20 °C freezer). Centrifuge at 18,400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Carefully pour out 70% ethanol.\nIncubate samples in 1.5 mL tubes at 50 °C until remaining ethanol is evaporated. Resuspend DNA pellets in 15 µL of autoclaved ddH2O or nuclease-free ddH2O.\nRun the extracted DNA samples, along with a DNA ladder, in a 1.5% agarose gel at 120−180 V and check the size of the sonicated DNA.\n5. Antibody incubation with beads\nNOTE: The following steps in this protocol are for approximately 2 x 107 neuronal cells differentiated from mouse ES cells. Do not freeze and thaw magnetic beads at any point during the ChIP-exo protocol as the beads may crack causing contamination of the sample or the antibody’s performance may be compromised.",
    "After cell lysis and sonication, prepare Protein G magnetic beads (Table of Materials) for ChIP, mix magnetic beads until homogenous, then add 25 µL of magnetic beads to 2 mL protein low bind tubes.\n\tNOTE: The type of magnetic beads used will depend on the species of the antibodies.\nWash beads with 1 mL of blocking solution (Table 2), mix well, then place on a magnetic rack for 1 min. While still on a magnetic rack, remove supernatant once it is clear.\nAdd 1 mL of blocking solution to the magnetic beads. Rock tubes for 10 min at 4 °C on a rocking platform. Briefly spin, then place tubes on a magnetic rack and remove supernatant.\nRepeat step 5.3 two more times.\nAdd 500 µL of blocking solution to magnetic beads. Briefly spin the antibody against Isl1 (0.04 µg/µL, Table of Materials), then add 4 µg of antibody to corresponding 2 mL protein low bind tubes containing the magnetic beads in blocking solution.\nRepeat step 5.5 without antibody (i.e., the no antibody control for ChIP).\n\tNOTE: The amount of antibody to add can be determined empirically by considering the quality of the antibody and the number of cells used for ChIP.\nRock samples at 4 °C for 6−24 h on a rocking platform.\n6. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)\nWash antibody-coated beads from step 5.8 with 1 mL of blocking solution. Place samples on a rocking platform at 4 °C for 5 min. Remove supernatant.\nRepeat step 6.1 two more times.\nResuspend antibody-coated beads in 50 µL of blocking solution, then transfer to new 2 mL protein low bind tubes. For each ChIP sample, add sonicated lysates (~1.0 mL from step 3.6) to antibody-coated beads in 2 mL protein low bind tubes.",
    "Incubate each sample on a rocking platform overnight at 4 °C.\n7. ChIP washes\nNOTE: Keep samples on ice or at 4 °C to maintain protein-DNA crosslinking during ChIP washes.\nMake high salt wash buffer, LiCl wash buffer and 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) as described in Table 3. Store in 50 mL tubes at 4 °C. Add 50 µL of 1000x CPI stock to all buffers just prior to use.\nBriefly spin samples in 2 mL protein low bind tubes to collect liquid from the caps, then place on a magnetic rack for 1 min and remove supernatant carefully with a pipette.\nFor ChIP washes, add 1 mL of lysis buffer 3 (at 4 °C) to each tube. Mix on a rocking platform at 4 °C for 5 min. Briefly spin samples, then place on a magnetic rack for 1 min and remove the supernatant with a pipette.\nAdd 1 mL of cold high salt wash buffer to each tube. Mix on a rocking platform at 4 °C for 5 min. Briefly spin samples, then place on a magnetic rack for 1 min and remove the supernatant with a pipette.\nAdd 1 mL of cold LiCl wash buffer to each tube. Mix on a rocking platform at 4 °C for 5 min. Briefly spin samples, then place on a magnetic rack for 1 min and remove the supernatant with a pipette.\nAdd 1 mL of cold 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) to each tube. Mix on a rocking platform at 4 °C for 5 min. Briefly spin samples, then place on a magnetic rack for 1 min and remove the supernatant with a pipette.\n\tNOTE: Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) can be used instead of Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4).\nRepeat steps 7.4−7.6 three times.",
    "Transfer the sample beads with 500 µL of Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) to fresh 1.5 mL tubes. Briefly spin samples, then place on a magnetic rack for 1 min and remove the supernatant with a pipette.\n8. End repair and dA-tailing reaction on beads\nNOTE: Sonication often generates non-blunt ended dsDNA. An end-repair reaction is required to make blunt-ended DNA prior to the dA-tailing reaction followed by the index adapter ligation step. For sticky end DNA ligation with index adapter DNA, dATP is added to the 3’ end of a blunt, dsDNA fragment by the dA-tailing reaction. End prep reaction mix contains dATP.\nAfter ChIP washes, add 38 µL of autoclaved ddH2O to the sample beads in 1.5 mL tubes for end repair and dA-tailing reaction.\nAdd 5.6 µL of end prep reaction mix and 2.4 µL of end prep enzyme mix (Table of Materials) to each sample (total reaction volume: 46 µL). Incubate samples at 20 °C for 30 min.\nWash beads as described in previous ChIP wash steps 7.4−7.6.\n9. Index adapter ligation on beads\nNOTE: The index adapter has 6−10 bases of barcoded index sequences, which are specific to a given sample used for multiplexing multiple samples in high-throughput sequencing. Index adapter DNA sequences are described in Table 1.\nFor index adapter ligation, add 27 µL of cold 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) to the sample beads. Add 2 µL of 15 µM index adapter, 0.5 µL of ligation enhancer, and 15 µL of ligase master mix (Table of Materials) to each sample (total reaction volume: 44.5 µL).\nIncubate samples at 20 °C for 15 min. Wash beads as described in steps 7.4−7.6.\n10. Fill-in reaction on beads",
    "NOTE: After adapter ligation, there is no phosphodiester bond between the 5’ end of the adapter and the 3’ end of the ChIP DNA. The nick can be repaired by a fill-in reaction.\nAdd 47 µL of cold 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) to the sample beads.\nMake the fill-in reaction mix (Table 4 and Table of Materials) on ice.\nAdd 11.1 µL of fill-in mix to each sample (total reaction volume: 58.1 µL). Incubate samples at 30 °C for 20 min. Wash beads as described in steps 7.4−7.6.\n11. Lambda exonuclease digestion on beads\nAfter fill-in reaction on beads, add 50 µL of cold autoclaved ddH2O to the sample beads.\nTo digest the ChIP DNA in the 5’ to 3’ direction, add 6 µL of 10x lambda exonuclease buffer and 2 µL of 5 U/µL lambda exonuclease (Table of Materials, total reaction volume: 58 µL). Incubate samples at 37 °C for 30 min. Wash beads as described in steps 7.4−7.6.\n12. Elution and reverse crosslinking\nMake ChIP elution buffer as described in Table 5.\n\tNOTE: Do not add CPI to ChIP elution buffer.\nTo elute ChIP samples from the beads, resuspend samples in 75 µL of ChIP elution buffer and incubate at 65 °C for 15 min at 130 x g.\nAdd 2.5 µL of 20 mg/mL proteinase K (Table of Materials) to the samples. Briefly vortex, then incubate the samples overnight at 65 °C.\n13. DNA extraction\nAfter samples have incubated overnight at 65 °C, briefly spin samples, place on a magnetic rack for 1 min, then transfer the supernatant from each sample to new 1.5 mL tubes.",
    "Add 1 µL of 10 mg/mL RNase A to the samples. Briefly vortex, then incubate the samples at 37 °C for 30 min. Add ~25 µL of autoclaved ddH2O to volume up to 100 µL.\nPurify DNA using magnetic beads (Table of Materials). Elute DNA with 16 µL of autoclaved ddH2O or nuclease-free ddH2O.\n14. Denaturing, primer annealing and primer extension\nAfter ChIP elution and reverse crosslinking, transfer 16 µL of the extracted DNA samples from step 13.3 to PCR tubes.\nMake denaturing and primer annealing mix (Table 6 and Table of Materials) on ice. Add 1.2 µL of denaturing and primer annealing mix to each sample (total reaction volume: 17.2 µL). Run samples using the program described in Table 6 to denature and anneal primers to the template DNA.\nMake primer extension mix (Table 7 and Table of Materials) on ice.\nOnce the program to denature and anneal primers is complete, add 3 µL of primer extension mix to the samples (total reaction volume: 20.2 µL). Run samples using the program for primer extension described in Table 7.\nImmediately proceed to dA-tailing reaction.\n15. dA-tailing reaction\nNOTE: For sticky end DNA ligation with universal adapter DNA, dATP is added to the 3’ end of blunt, dsDNA by the dA-tailing reaction.\nMake dA-tailing mix (Table 8 and Table of Materials) on ice.\nAdd 4.1 µL of dA-tailing mix to each sample (total reaction volume: 24.3 µL). Run samples using the program for dA-tailing (Table 8).\nImmediately proceed to universal adapter ligation.\n16. Universal adapter ligation\nNOTE: The universal adapter includes high-throughput sequencing-specific sequences for DNA sample recognition for sequencing chemistry. The universal adapter DNA sequences are described in Table 1.\nAfter dA-tailing reaction, make universal adapter ligation mix (Table 9 and Table of Materials) for universal adapter ligation.",
    "Add 21.5 µL to each sample (total reaction volume: 45.8 µL) and incubate samples for 15 min at 20 °C.\n17. DNA cleanup \nPurify DNA using magnetic beads (Table of Materials). Elute DNA with 21 µL of autoclaved ddH2O or nuclease-free ddH2O.\nStore samples at -20 °C until ready to perform ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR) and PCR purification.\n18. Ligation-mediated PCR\nNOTE: LM-PCR primer sequences are described in Table 1.\nAfter DNA cleanup, make LM-PCR mix (Table 10 and Table of Materials) on ice.\nAdd 29 µL of LM-PCR mix to each sample (total reaction volume: 50 µL) and run samples using the program for LM-PCR (Table 10).\nImmediately proceed to gel purification of PCR amplified DNA, followed by DNA purification for high-throughput sequencing.\n19. DNA purification of LM-PCR amplified DNA\nRun the LM-PCR amplified DNA samples, along with a DNA ladder, in a 1.5% agarose gel at 120−180 V and excise 200–400 bp bands.\nPurify DNA from the excised gel using a gel extraction kit (Table of Materials).\nAfter DNA purification, check the concentration (Table of Materials) of each ChIP-exo library sample. Submit samples for high-throughput sequencing for single-read sequencing.\n\tNOTE: The preferred read length for single-read sequencing is at least 35 bp, which is sufficient to uniquely align the sequencing reads to the reference genome in mouse or human cells. For most transcription factors in mouse or human cells, 10−20 million reads per ChIP-exo sample are sufficient to identify their genomic binding locations. At least 30 million reads per sample are required to map genomic regions enriched in histone marks in mammalian cells.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
