    "1. Antibody Labeling (Figure 1)\nMake 0.1 M NaHCO3 buffer:\n \n8.4 g NaHCO3\n29.2 g NaCl\n1 liter H2O\nBring the buffer up to a pH of 8.4 with this solution (10.6 g Na2CO3, 29.2 g NaCl, 1 liter H20).\nAdd 35 μl Atto550 NHS to 70 μl anti-hnRNPA1 and 500 μl NaHCO3 buffer and rotate for 1 hr at room temperature. After the hour-long rotation, inject the mixture into a dialyzer and dialyze in 2 liters of PBS overnight.\nThe next day, concentrate the dialyzed Atto550 NHS anti-hnRNPA1 using a spin column (Amicon Ultra 0.5).\nAfter the Atto550 NHS labeled anti-hnRNPA1 antibody has been concentrated, nano-drop sample to determine the concentration.\n2. Antibody Transfection (Figure 2)\nSeed 105 cells/well into 500 μl of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM/F12+10% FBS+1% antibiotic) in an 8 well slide 24 hr prior to transfection. Cell confluency should be at least 70%.\nTwenty four hours after seeding, add 2 μl of Ab-DeliverIN reagent into an Eppendorf tube.\nNext, add 2 μg of Atto550 NHS labeled anti-hnRNPA1 antibody (0.5 μg/μl) to the same Eppendorf tube and incubate 10-15 min at RT.\nDuring the incubation, aspirate media and add 394 μl of fresh DMEM media to the cells.\nNote: Add 500 μl DMEM to one chamber of untouched cells to act as a control.\nAfter incubation, add 100 μl of DMEM to the antibody mixture, mix by pipetting up and down, and add to the cells in DMEM for a total volume of 500 μl.\nChange the media after 48 hr of antibody delivery.\nNote: Protocol was repeated with FITC labeled rIgG as positive control.\n3. Live and Fixed Imaging to Determine Efficiency\nImage cells live at 48 hr using the Cy3 filter on a fluorescent microscope to image the transfected Atto550 NHS labeled antibodies.",
    "After live imaging has been completed, aspirate the media and fix cells.\nAfter aspirating media, treat cells with 0.4% Paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Wash cells 4 x 5 min each with PBS. Then, mount cells with mounting media containing DAPI reagent and fix coverslip. Measure transfection efficiency of the fixed cells with Axiovision software. If Axiovision software is not on hand, simply count the events from your image by hand and plug results into calculation in 3.7. Alternatively, ImageJ software can be used for these calculations.\nFirst, use the \"Events\" measurement to count the total number of cells in your image of choice at 20x magnification.\nNext, use the \"Events\" measurement to count the cells that were not successfully transfected with antibodies in the same 20x magnification image.\nTo access the measured \"Events\" in an Excel style format, click on \"Properties\", click the \"Measurement\" tab, and click to view \"As Table.\"\nFinally, use the following calculation to determine your transfection efficiency by comparing the two previously measured events: ((Total cells - Untransfected Cells) / Total Cells) x 100 = Transfection Efficiency.\n4. Representative Results\nThe live images of untransfected (Figure 3A) compared to transfected (Figure 3B) neurons reveal that the labeling of the antibodies (red or green in each figure) is clearly observed within cells (Figure 3B, C, D). Following aspiration and washing with media to remove antibodies between or adherent to the surface of cells, labeled antibodies are still present within neurons (Figure 3C, D). To calculate the transfection efficiency, use the Axiovision software to calculate total cells compared to cells that were not successfully transfected. These values were entered into a transfection efficiency formula to acquire the transfection efficiency as a percentage of total cells (Figure 4).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4154/4154fig1.jpg",
