    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAcquiring input data layers for prioritization\nTiming: minutes to weeks\nSeveral input data layers are needed to solve a systematic conservation planning problem successfully. This step details how I acquired spatial data layers for my wolverine conservation planning problem (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1156-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. The steps of the prioritization framework needed to generate conservation planning solutions\nStudy Area\nI selected areas with the highest connectivity value (20%) from the previous Circuitscape analysis (Carroll et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) in western Montana. This boundary defined areas in which I conducted all other analyses. For this analysis, having a smaller study area helped limit the prioritization analysis to the region of highest interest to collaborators and reduced computation time.\nEcological Features\nI included four input features to prioritize in the planning problem: current female presence, core size, human modification, and habitat core centrality. I selected these variables based on evidence in the literature and their importance for dispersal and population growth (Carroll et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nOf the four input features, three were generated using wolverine camera trap data from Lukacs et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] and a “core” habitat shapefile generated in Carroll et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2].\nPlanning Unit Cost\nUsing Montana cadastral data (www.cdastral.mt.gov[href=http://www.cdastral.mt.gov]), I generated a parcel-level estimate of easement costs. The cadastral data provided a unique tax-assessed property value for each parcel. Easement values were calculated by taking 50% of property value and adding $5000 (Ferraro, 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nProtected Areas\nI downloaded shapefiles of protected areas from the Protected Areas Database of the US (PAD-US 2.0) at usgs.gov[href=http://usgs.gov] (U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Gap Analysis Project (GAP), 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]).\nNote: There is a newer version (2.1) of the PAD-US dataset available.",
    "A spatial layer or column in a spatial layer can be used to identify whether parcels are already “locked-in.” A locked-in parcel can also be referred to as a “fixed” parcel or protected area. I designated conservation easements, state lands, and federal lands as fixed areas.\nIt should be noted that the activities permitted on protected lands vary greatly, and research goals should determine whether to treat a parcel as fixed or not. I treated all land with any degree of protection as fixed because the goal in this study was to find private land where willing landowners would consider easements.\nCritical: Spatial analysis is a growing field in ecology that requires understanding how any given feature was generated. All input feature layers should be thoroughly reviewed based on their conservation relevance, resolution, and accuracy to ensure the success of later steps.\nInteger linear programming with priortizr and a gurobi optimization solver\nTiming: minutes to weeks\nI recommend prior experience or practice with R Statistical Software for this section. For additional examples, see prioritizr.net[href=http://prioritizr.net] and Gurobi.com[href=http://Gurobi.com].\nInstall Gurobi\nGurobi is a commercial computer program and a powerful and fast solver that works well with priortizr. There are several steps to use this software:\nObtain a license from the Gurobi website. This license is free with an academic affiliation, otherwise, it has an associated cost. Save the license number obtained from the webpage.\nDownload the software. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.3]\nActivate and verify the license.\nNote: R Statistical Software (r-project.org[href=http://r-project.org]) is required for the following steps; RStudio is highly recommended as a user-friendly interface (rstudio.com[href=http://rstudio.com]). Both are free software.\nLoad necessary R Statistical Software Packages. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.5]\nUsing the library function in R, call the following packages: prioritzr, sp, sf, raster, and rgdal.\nImport all data layers into R Statistical Software.",
    "All of the layers detailed above must be imported into R Statistical software or RStudio (recommended). Shapefiles can be imported using readOGR and rasters using the raster function.\nCreate one or more planning problems using the example code provided at priortizr.net[href=http://priortizr.net].\nI created four planning problems.\nEach of the problems I created had a unique relative target. The targets I set were 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, and 0.50. These values (ranging from 0 to 1) tell the planning problem the maximum level of representation I wanted for each feature within the study area.\nI included a minimum set objective in all problems to minimize the cost of my solutions.\nI added binary decisions so that each parcel was either prioritized or not (e.g., a binary solution for each problem).\nI added the Gurobi solver to ensure the code called the Gurobi software for the problem.\nI added my fixed or already protected parcels.\nOptional: There are many additional options in the priortizr R package suite, including the addition of boundary penalties to reduce fragmentation and contiguity constraints to bolster connectivity. There is also an option to rank the irreplaceability of solutions. I chose not to implement these given my study area’s interspersion of private and public land (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1156-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Example of final prioritization map\nEvaluate Prioritization Performance\nThe performance of the solution can be evaluated by printing the solution cost summary as illustrated on priortizr.net[href=http://priortizr.net].\nSolutions should be visually inspected before being exported or mapped using the spplot function in R."
