  "procedures": [
    "This protocol has been performed on 6 common marmosets (4 males, 2 females; body weight = 320-470 g; age = 14-53 months). All procedures were carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The protocol was approved by the RIKEN Ethical Committee (No. H28-2-221(3)). All surgical procedures were performed under anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used as well as their discomfort.\n1. Preparation\nObtain a structural magnetic resonance image (MRI) of each individual brain. This will be used to identify electrode positions through registration with a marmoset brain atlas and computer tomography (CT).\nPreparation of the ECoG array: prepare a customized multichannel ECoG array (Figure 1A). A 96ch ECoG array consists of two sheets with 32 and 64 electrodes. To accommodate individual differences in brain size, the ECoG array has a flexible arm. The arm can cover the temporal pole, depending on individual brain shape. Place the reference electrodes facing opposite to the ECoG electrodes and the ground electrodes facing the same direction.\n\t\nAssemble the ECoG array with a connector case (Figure 1B) and seal gaps of connector (Figure 1C) using acrylic glue to prevent the inflow of liquid during surgery. Sterilize the array with ethylene oxide gas.\nPrepare and sterilize instruments.\nNOTE: All instruments used are listed in the Table of Materials.\n2. Implantation of ECoG Array\nNOTE: Withdraw ingestion of food and liquids greater than 4 h prior to surgery. Perform all surgical steps with aseptic technique using sterilized gloves and instruments.\nPre-implant procedures\nInduce anesthesia in the marmoset by intramuscular (i.m.) injection of ketamine (15 mg/kg) 5 min after i.m. atropine (0.08 mg/kg) injection.",
    "Anesthetize and maintain anesthesia using isoflurane (1-3% diluted with a mixture of oxygen/nitrous oxide) depending on the physiological state of the animal, which should be continuously monitored. Ensure that heart rate is 130-180 BPM and monitor body temperature and arterial blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) continuously to judge the animal’s condition.\nShave the top of the animal’s head with clippers and a hair remover. Fully rinse hair-removal cream off the skin with wet gauze, or it will cause skin damage.\nAdminister an antibiotic (cefovecin; 16 mg/kg s.c.), antihypertensive (furosemide; 2.0 mg/kg i.m.), and antihemorrhagic (carbazochrome sodium sulfonate hydrate; 0.2 mg/kg i.m.).\nPlace the animal on a stereotaxic frame. At this time, apply 2% lidocaine jelly to the ear-bars and ophthalmic ointment to the eyes to prevent dryness and postoperative pain.\nDisinfect the surgical area with iodine solution and cover it with sterilized drapes. Apply 2% lidocaine jelly to the place of the skin incision.\nImplantation procedures\nIncise skin about 4 cm through the midline of the scalp with a scalpel. Detach the temporal muscle from the skull with a curette until all of the surgical area is exposed. Clean out tissues on the skull surface and stop the bleeding completely with pressure hemostasis, and with bone wax, if necessary. Wrap the edge of the skin and muscles with moistened gauze. Keep the gauze moistened during surgery.\nPlace the frontal edge of the array onto the edge of the frontal pole. Mark a planned area for the craniotomy, slits, and holes on the skull with a sterile pencil. The craniotomy location will depend on the design of the array (Figure 2).",
    "Drill the craniotomy along mark 1, as shown in Figure 2. While drilling the bone, blow air at the cutting edge to maintain a clear view for the surgeon. Next, cut the bone all the way around mark 2, as the bone piece will still be attached to dura at the center. Lift the piece up gently from one edge and peel off the dura with a spatula. This process must be conducted slowly and carefully, or it will tear the dura easily.\n\t\t\nRemove the bone tips from the bone piece and wrap the piece with moistened gauze, as this piece will be returned after implanting the array.\nPerform craniotomy 3 and 4 as shown in Figure 2. These allow the insertion of electrodes into the orbitofrontal and occipital areas, respectively.\nDrill slits on mark 5 as shown in Figure 2. These slits allow examination of the array to ensure that it is properly inserted.\nThe dura will now be exposed. Wash the area with saline and stop the bleeding with pressure hemostasis and a gelatin sponge, if necessary. The edge of the open craniotomy may need to be cleaned with a curette or bone rongeur.\nMake the slits (marked 6 in Figure 2) into which the reference electrodes are placed. Place the reference electrodes in the epidural space at the contra-lateral sensorimotor and occipital areas. The position should be determined according to specific experimental needs.\nDrill screw holes at four points around each stem of the connector with a 1.0 mm screw (crosses in Figure 2). To prevent damage to the dura matter, insert a spatula under the skull. These holes should be orthogonal against the skull. Then, install PEEK screws (1.4 x 2.5 mm) as anchors to fix the connector to the skull.",
    "Insert the ECoG array into the epidural space. Use flathead forceps to hold the array.\nNOTE: The array should be inserted without bending. If the array is bent, create an appropriate space by inserting a spatula between the skull and dura. If the bending was caused by the relatively small size of the brain, cut off some of the electrodes.\nFix the reference and ground electrodes with a dental acrylic. Place the reference electrodes in the epidural space and ground electrodes on the cranial surface. Both contacts should face the skull.\nPut the bone piece back and fix the connector and head post to the skull with dental acrylic on the screws.\nSuture the skin with 6-0 nylon at the forehead and rear head, and fix the skin to the sides of the connector using skin closures.\nPost-implantation procedures\nRemove the animal from the stereotaxic frame. Ensure that the animal is kept warm and provided with oxygen during the following steps.\nImmediately after surgery, inject the animal with meloxicam (0.3 mg/kg i.m.) to decrease postoperative pain. Administer an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid (dexamethasone; 2.0 mg/kg i.m.) and subcutaneous infusion (lactated Ringer’s solution; 5.0 mL), including famotidine (0.5 mg/kg) as a gastroprotectant.\n\t\tNOTE: A concurrent use of NSAIDs with steroids has a potential for gastrointestinal side effects.\nAfter the animal has recovered (confirm by heart rate and SpO2), remove vital sign monitoring and transfer the animal into the ICU for 2-3 days.\n3. Postoperative Treatment\nNOTE: It typically takes 5 days for animals to recover completely from the surgery.",
    "To prevent brain swelling, administer the anti-inflammatory corticosteroid dexamethasone (2.0 mg/kg) twice a day on the first day after surgery. Then, reduce the dose to 1.5 mg/kg twice a day on the second and third days, and 1 mg/kg twice a day on the fourth day.\nAdminister pain relief (meloxicam; 0.1 mg/kg oral; once a day) and an antihemorrhagic (carbazochrome sodium sulfonate hydrate; 0.2 mg/kg i.m.; twice a day) for 5 days after surgery.\nNOTE: In our case, 1-2 days after the surgery, some marmosets (3 out of 6) became less active and vomited. This may have been caused by increased intracranial pressure due to a blood clot. When marmosets presented these symptoms, we reopened the head and removed the clot under general anesthesia (alfaxalone). If there was no bending of the ECoG array during the implantation, the blood clot was likely in the space between the array and where the bone piece was returned. In this case, the blood clot can be washed away by running saline into the space using a catheter. This procedure usually leads to recovery in the animal.\nIdentification of electrode locations\nAround 1 week after surgery, perform a computer tomography (CT) scan of the animal’s head.\nNOTE: This is a good opportunity to check if signals can be recorded properly. Open the connector case and remove any blood clots if they are present.\nAlign T2-weighted MRI to stereotaxic coordinates using AFNI software18 (https://afni.nimh.nih.gov) (Figure 3A). Align the CT image to T2-weighted anatomical magnetic resonance images with AFNI (Figure 3B). Register a marmoset brain atlas to MRI (Figure 3C) with AFNI and ANTS19.\nSubscription Required.
