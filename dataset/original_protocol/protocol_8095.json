    "All animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of South Carolina (federal assurance number: D16-00028).\n1. Preparation of DiI/Tungsten bead tubing\nDissolve 100 mg of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) with 10 mL of ddH2O. Vortex the PVP solution lightly.\nFill the tubing with the PVP solution (see Table of Materials) and leave it for 20 min. Then, expel the PVP solution through the other end of the tubing using a 10 mL syringe.\nCombine 170 mg of tungsten microcarrier beads with 250 µL of methylene chloride. Vortex the tungsten bead suspension thoroughly.\nCombine 6 mg of lipophilic DilC18(3) dye with 300 µL of methylene chloride. Vortex the DilC18(3) dye solution thoroughly.\n\tNOTE: Perform steps 1.3–1.4 in a fume hood.\nPipette 250 µL of the tungsten bead suspension onto a glass slide. Wait for the suspension to air dry (~3 min).\nAdd 300 µL of DilC18(3) dye solution on the top of the tungsten bead suspension layer. Mix the DiIC18(3) dye solution and tungsten bead suspension thoroughly with a pipette tip and allow the mixture to air dry (~3 min).\nOnce dried, use a razor blade to split the mixture into two 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes. Fill the tubes with water.\nSonicate in a water bath (Amp I, 100%) until homogenous (~5 min). Ensure that the tip of the sonicator lies directly on the tubes with the bead suspension.\nCombine the two 1.5 mL of homogenized mixture into a 15 mL conical tube. Sonicate the mixture for another 3 min.\nDraw the tungsten beads-DilC18(3) dye mixture into the PVP-coated tubing using a 10 mL syringe. Feed the tubing into the preparation station (see Table of Materials).",
    "Rotate for 1 min on the preparation station. Carefully remove all the water from the tubing using a 10 mL syringe.\nTurn on the nitrogen gas and adjust the nitrogen flow to approximately 0.5 Liters per minute (LPM), rotate the tubing in the preparation station, and dry with nitrogen for 30 min.\nRemove the tubing from the preparation station and cut into 13 mm lengths (matching the loading size of the cartridge) using a tubing cutter. Keep the 13 mm lengths in scintillation vials in the dark.\n2. Preparation of brain sections\nNOTE: Adult male F344/N rats were pair housed in a controlled environment under a 12/12 light:dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. All animals were cared for using guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\nDeeply anesthetize rats using 5% sevoflurane.\nProceed to the following step when the rats are not responsive to noxious stimuli and reflexes are absent.\nSecure the rat in a supine position inside a chemical fume hood.\nMake an incision through the skin along the thoracic midline. Separate the diaphragm and open the chest with scissors. Insert a 20 G × 25 mm needle into the left ventricle.\nImmediately cut the right atrium with scissors. Perfuse 50 mL of 100 mM PBS with 5 mL/min of flow rate. Perfuse 100 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde buffered in 100 mM PBS.\nRemove the entire rat brain right after perfusion.\nPostfix the entire brain for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde.\n\tNOTE: Do not postfix in 4% paraformaldehyde for more than 30 min, because it will affect the labeling.",
    "Cut 500 µm thick coronal sections using a rat brain matrix (see Table of Materials). Make the first cut and keep the blade in place. Make a second cut using a second blade and vertically remove the first blade, keeping the tissue on the blade surface.\nPlace the brain slices in a 24 well plate with 1 mL of 100 mM PBS in each well. Repeat this process until all slices have been cut.\n3. Ballistic labeling and visualization of brain sections\nRemove the PBS from each targeted well.\nLoad the cartridge with a piece of DiI/Tungsten bead tubing and place it into the applicator.\nPut a piece of filter paper between two mesh screens. Connect the applicator to the helium hose. Adjust the output pressure of helium to 90 pounds per square inch (psi).\nPlace the applicator vertically by hand on the center of the targeted well at a distance of 1.5 cm between the sample and the mesh screen. Fire the DiI/Tungsten beads tubing.\n\tNOTE: Be sure to remove all PBS from the targeted wells before shooting.\nLoad the cartridge with the next DiI/Tungsten bead tubing. Continuously fire the DiI/Tungsten beads from the tubing on the remaining slices.\nFill the 24 well plate with 100 mM of PBS. Wash with 500 µL of fresh 100 mM of PBS 3x. Do not let the slices flip over while washing with PBS.\nAdd 500 µL of fresh 100 mM PBS and keep the slices at 4 °C in the dark for 3 h.\nTransfer the brain slices onto glass slides using a fine brush.\n\tNOTE: Three brain sections can be transferred onto each glass slide.",
    "Immediately add 1 mL of antifade mounting medium onto each section. Place a 22 mm x 50 mm coverslip over the brain sections. Dry the glass slides in the dark for 2 days.\nTurn on the confocal microscope system and switch to a 60× objective.\nSet the confocal microscope system to have a magnification of 60× (A/1.4, oil) and a Z-plane interval of 0.15 μm (pinhole size 30 μm, back-projected pinhole radius 167 nm). Use a 543 nm wavelength to acquire images of the neurons of interest.\nObtain Z-stack images for the targeted neuron type based on brain region boundaries and morphological characteristics of neurons.\n\tNOTE: Acquire at least three images fromm each animal.\n4. Use of the methodology with cell culture\nIsolate primary cortical neurons from F344/N rats at postnatal day one using previously reported methodology14.\nCulture primary cortical neurons in a 35 mm glass bottom dish for one week. Change half of the culture medium with fresh neuron growth medium at third day after isolation. Wash the glass bottom dish 2x with 1 mL of 100 mM PBS.\nFix with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Repeat steps 3.2–3.6 to ballistically label the cells.\nWash with 1 mL of 100 mM PBS 3x. Add 500 µL of fresh 100 mM of PBS and keep it at 4 °C in the dark for 3 h.\nAdd 200 µL of antifade mounting medium.\nObtain Z-stack images for each targeted neuron using the parameters in step 3.10.\n5. Neuronal analysis and dendritic spine quantification\nBlind neurons using code numbers to prevent experimenter bias.\nEstablish selection criteria for neurons based on the brain region of interest.",
    "NOTE: Selection criteria for neurons include continuous dendritic staining, low background, no dye clusters inside of the cells, minimal diffusion of the DiI dye into the extracellular space, correct morphology of pyramidal neurons (Figure 1).\nOpen neuronal reconstruction software (See the attached Video 1).\nLoad an image file by clicking on the “File Folder” image in the upper left-hand corner.\nClick “Soma” and mark the soma of the neurons on the image.\nClick “Tree” and select “User-Guided”.\nTrace all dendritic branches of interest.\n\tNOTE: For pyramidal neurons, which are characterized by one apical dendrite and multiple basilar dendrites, only the apical dendrite is traced. Make sure all connecting branches are attached to one another.\nClick “Spine”.\nDefine Detection Parameters and click “Detect All”.\n\tNOTE: For brain slices, the consistent parameters utilized across brain regions are: 2.0 (Outer Range), 0.3 (Minimum Height), 100% (Detector Sensitivity), and 10 (Minimum Count). For cell culture, it is necessary to increase the Detector Sensitivity and decrease the Minimum Count.\nClassify spines by selecting “Classify All”.\n\tNOTE: Dendritic spines are classified using an algorithm integral to the neuronal reconstruction software15.\nSave tracing by selecting the Disk Image in the upper left-hand corner.\nPerform neuronal and dendritic spine morphological analyses.\n\t\nOpen neuronal reconstruction quantitative analysis software (See attached Video 2).\nLoad image by clicking “File” and “Open Data File”.\nClick “Analysis” and “Branched Structure Analysis” to analyze neuronal morphology and dendritic spine morphology.\nFor neuronal morphology, click “Tree Totals” and select the box for “Dendrite Totals”.\nFor dendritic spine morphology, click “Spines” and then select the box for “Spine Details”.\nSave output as a text (.txt) file by right-clicking the output table and selecting “Save to File”.\nClick “Analyze” and “Sholl Analysis”.\nSet the Starting Radius to 10 μm and the Radius Increment to 10 μm.",
