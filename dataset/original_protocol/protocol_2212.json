Wet the lower abdomen by spraying with 70% Ethanol, and use a surgical scissor and forceps to open the abdominal cavity (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1820-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Dissection of the mouse testis\n(A) Exposure of the perigonadal white adipose tissue (pgWAT) after opening the lower abdomen of an adult male mouse.\n(B) Exposure of the testis and the cauda epididymis by pulling out the pgWAT with forceps.\n(C) Morphology of the testis after peeling off the tunica albuginea.\nPull out the perigonadal white adipose tissue (pgWAT) with a tweezer. Dissect the two whole testes off the epididymis, remove any leftover fat, and keep them in cold 1×KREBS in a 60 mm dish on ice.\nUnder dissection microscopy, carefully remove the tunica albuginea with a pair of sharp forceps one by one for each testis, and pool them in a fresh drop of 500 μL 1×KREBS (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nTesticular Germ Cell Suspension Preparation.\nBriefly pull apart the seminiferous tubules using a pair of forceps to expose the interstitial cells (e.g., Leydig cells). See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A for an example of slightly dispersed seminiferous tubules.\nTransfer the spermatogenic tubules to a 50 mL centrifuge tube containing 10 mL of freshly prepared collagenase buffer.\nIncubate the centrifuge tube in a 37°C incubator at 80 rpm for 5 min.",
    "Note: This step is to roughly digest the interstitial cells out of the seminiferous tubules. Do not over-digest the tubules, which might cause over fragmentation resulting in a loss of germ cells. It is beneficial to gently disperse the tubules by pipetting up and down several times briefly with a wide-bore tip (by cutting out the end of a 1 mL tip).\nTop up the collagenase buffer to a final 40 mL with fresh ice-cold 1×KREBS, and let the tubes stand straightly on ice to allow the tubules to settle down for ∼1 min.\nNote: Watch carefully, and once the tubules all settle down to the bottom of the tube, carefully discard the supernatant using a 10 mL pipetman.\nAdd fresh 40 mL ice-cold 1×KREBS solution and gently mix. Repeat this wash step about 2–3 times until the supernatant turns from turbid to clear.\nNote: The initial supernatant consists of abundant interstitial cells, e.g., Leydig cells, and thus looks highly turbid. During a short time frame of settlement on ice, the big chunk of tubules settles down faster to the bottom while the interstitial cells remain in the supernatant. Therefore, repeated wash with fresh 1×KREBS will eliminate interstitial cell contamination. Do not let the tube stand on ice too long, which might cause concurrent sedimentation of somatic cells.\nAfter the last wash, carefully discard the residual 1×KREBS, transfer the tubules-containing solution into a 60 mm dish, use forceps to disperse the seminiferous tubules gently, and cut them into small pieces with sterile surgical blades. See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] for the representative morphology of the dispersed tubules before (B) and after cutting (C).\nNote: This step is optional. However, it will enhance the digestion efficiency for trypsin enzyme in the following steps, and thus increase the germ cell yield.",
    "Add 10 mL of freshly prepared trypsin buffer (1 mg/mL of trypsin in Ca2+/Mg2+-free 1×HBSS, plus 5 μg/mL DNase I), mix gently and place it in a 37°C incubator and shake for 10 min (∼80 rpm).\nNote: At this step, the buffer has no Ca2+/Mg2+, which guarantees the optimal reaction milieu for trypsin digestion.\nAdd 10 mL of 1×HBSS (1×HBSS with Ca2+/Mg2+, and plus 50 μL DNase I stock), then gently disperse the digested tubules with a 1 mL wide-bore tip every five minutes, shake for 10–20 min.\nCritical: Check the condition of the tubules. Once the solution turns cloudy and only a tiny fraction of fragmented tubules is present (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D), transfer the tube on ice and let the tubules settle down.\nNote: We found that the gentle pipetting greatly facilitates the trypsin digestion and thus boosts the cell yield. In addition, it is critical to use narrow-bore tips when tubules are fragmented into small pieces. Do not over-digest the cells, which likely causes cell death and DNA release resulting in cell clumping.\nCarefully transfer the supernatant containing single cells to a new 50 mL tube and quench the trypsin digestion by adding a final 2% FBS.\nTo the residual cell pellet containing undigested tubules, add ∼5 mL of freshly prepared trypsin buffer, mix gently and place it in a 37°C incubator and shake for 5–10 min (∼80 rpm).\nCombine both trypsin-digested single-cell suspensions into one 50 mL tube. Pellet the cells by centrifugation at 700 g for 5 min at 4°C. Gently discard the supernatant.\nNote: Centrifugation with a swinging bucket rotor at low speed will preserve the viability of germ cells.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 10 mL elutriation buffer supplemented with DNase I (5 μg/mL), gently pipetting up and down.",
    "Note: Use the elutriation buffer containing BSA. It helps reduce the loss of germ cells throughout the buffer flowing through the elutriation tubing system. In addition, the supplement of DNase I is helpful in preventing the cell clumping before and during centrifugal elutriation.\n(Optional) Add 90 μL of the germ cell suspension to 10 μL trypan blue (0.04%), incubate for 3 min, then take 10 μL of the cell suspension and count the number of living and dead cells under a microscope.\nFilter through a 70 μm cell strainer. Add a final 2% FBS to the flow-through mixture. Keep on ice before elutriation.\nNote: At this step, we recommend going straightly to the next step for elutriation without stop because long-term storage of single-cell suspension on ice will reduce cell viability and cause cell clumping.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1820-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Schematic diagram of the tubing pipeline connecting the buffer reservoir, sample chamber, and elutriator in the JE5.0 elutriator system (Beckman Coulter)\nSingle cells are sequentially purified into different fractions based on their distinct sedimentation velocity as implemented by the centrifugal force and pumping.\nCentrifugal elutriation\nTiming: 45 min",
    "The setup of the elutriation system (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) can be accomplished among the single-cell digestion procedures. The readers are strongly recommended to refer to the operational manual of Beckman JE5.0 system prior to first-time use. The parameters provided below are specifically for purification of germ cells from 2–10 adult mouse testes (from 1–5 mice).\nElutriation system set up.\nSet up the Centrifugal elutriator parameters: Speed: 3000 rpm; Temp: 20°C; Timer: HOLD Pump speed: 5.0 mL/min.\nNote: It is important to the buffer temperature must be constant from reservoir to elutriation chamber.\nFill the buffer reservoir tank with 1.5 L of elutriation buffer.\nPrior to testicular single-cell suspension loading to the sample chamber, switch the 3-way bypass valve to the position that allows single-cell suspension to flow into the chamber, but the air is restrained to enter the system.\nNote: Make sure that the bypass valve is closed.\nSet the initial flow rate of the peristaltic pump at 5.0 mL/min.\nNote: Determine an initial flow rate that will ensure all size ranges of particles to be fractionated are retained.\nPut the collection tube into the buffer reservoir chamber so that the buffer will circulate inside the tubing system at 4°C. Start the elutriator and the pump.\nElutriation process.\nRight before cell loading, gently pipet up and down and filter the cell suspension through a 70 μm cell strainer into a new 50 mL tube on ice.\nNote: High cell density (>108/ mL) can cause cell re-aggregation, and the maximum volume of cell suspension can be determined according to the injection device.\nOpen the injector valve and inject the cell suspension into the sample chamber.\nOnce the samples are loaded, open the 3-way valve to connect the buffer reservoir chamber to the elutriator.",
    "Let the buffer run out until all the cells flow into the sample reservoir.\nOnce the cell suspension has completely entered the elutriation chamber, close the injection valve.\nRefer to the procedure in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for cell collection.\nNote: Just before the suspension lowers down to the bottom of the syringe, turn the bypass valve back toward the syringe to stop the sample flow. This will prevent any air bubbles from entering the line.\nStart fraction collection (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]):\nFraction 1 (pump: 13.4 mL/min; elutriator: 3000 rpm): Collect four 50 mL tubes (200 mL in total): Major cell population-elongating spermatids ;\nFraction 2 (pump: 18.2 mL/min; elutriator: 3000 rpm): Collect two 50 mL tubes (100 mL in total): Major cell population-elongating spermatids;\nFraction 3 (pump: 23.6 mL/min; elutriator: 3000 rpm): Collect two 50 mL tubes (100 mL in total): Major cell population- elongating spermatids and round spermatids;\nFraction 4 (pump: 19.6 mL/min; elutriator: 2250 rpm): Collect three 50 mL tubes (150 mL in total): Major cell population-round spermatids;\nFraction 5 (pump: 21 mL/min; elutriator: 2250 rpm): Collect two 50 mL tubes (100 mL in total): Major cell population-round spermatids;\nFraction 6 (pump: 23.6 mL/min; elutriator: 2250 rpm): Collect two 50 mL tubes (100 mL in total): Major cell population-round spermatids;\nFraction 7 (pump: 34 mL/min; elutriator: 2250 rpm): Collect three 50 mL tubes (150 mL in total): Major cell population- round spermatids and pachytene spermatocytes;\nFraction 8 (pump: 40.5 mL/min; elutriator: 2250 rpm): Collect three 50 mL tubes (150 mL in total): Major cell population-pachytene spermatocytes.\nFraction 9 (pump: 45 mL/min; elutriator: 2250 rpm): Collect two 50 mL tubes (100 mL in total): Major cell population-pachytene spermatocytes.",
    "Note: Cell fractionation is achieved by adjusting the pump speed and elutriator speed. Collect 50 mL suspension each time using a 50 mL tube.\nOnce all fractions are collected, turn off the centrifuge, and let all leftover elutriation buffer run out.\nPerform the system cleaning: Turn off the elutriator, and replenish the buffer reservoir tank with 100 mL of freshly prepared 6% Hydrogen peroxide, followed by 500 mL of sterile water to rinse and sterilize the tubing system.\nNote: This cleaning step can be executed during the waiting periods of the centrifugation in the following steps.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation of each fraction at 700 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nNote: Centrifugation using a swimming bucket rotor at low speed will preserve the viability of germ cells.\nCarefully discard the supernatant, add 1 mL of 1×KREBS to each tube and resuspend the cell pellet. Transfer the cell suspension into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and repeat centrifugation at 700 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nNote: Depending on downstream applications, washing by 1×KREBS will eliminate BSA contamination.\nAfter the last wash, carefully remove all supernatant and freeze down the cell pellet at −80°C, or leave an appropriate volume of the supernatant as needed and resuspend the cells, proceed to downstream operations (RNA extraction, protein extraction, etc).\nNote: To achieve optimal results, it is necessary to thoroughly sterilize and clean the whole connecting tubing system in the elutriation machine at the end of each time. This will eliminate potential bacterial fermentation or other contaminations inside the chambers and the tubes.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1820_11.csv",
    "Note: The parameters provided in this table are specifically optimized for a standard chamber in the JE5.0 machine. If using a Sanderson chamber in the JE5.0 machine, the flow rate needs to be re-calculated based on the formula: [flow rate (Standard Chamber) =flow rate (Sanderson Chamber) ∗1.35].\nOptional: Validation of cell purity in each fraction by DAPI staining.\nNote: This procedure is only required for the initial validation of cell purification. Once the parameters are optimized, it can be skipped owing to the high reproducibility by centrifugal elutriation.\nLabel an appropriate number of glass slides. Draw a ring of ∼1 cm in diameter with a grease pen and let the grease dry.\nTransfer 20 μL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) into each ring on the slides.\nImmediately add 2 μL of the purified cell suspension from each fraction. Repeat for each fraction.\nNote: Always keep all cell suspensions on ice.\nLet the slides stand at 20°C–25°C for ∼1 h until samples become dry, or cover them in a chamber and leave 8–12 h.\nWash slides three times for 5 min each with 1×PBS at 20°C–25°C.\nRemove the excess buffer by gently tapping one corner of the slide on the desk or using lint-free kimwipes.\nAspirate ∼10 μL of DAPI-containing mounting medium to cover the circled samples (Antifade Mountant with DAPI, Invitrogen).\nImage the samples under a fluorescence microscope to evaluate the cell type enriched in each fraction.\nNote: Different cell types can be defined by their distinct nuclear morphology as visualized by DAPI staining.\nOptional: Indirect fluorescence staining.\nSpread 2 μL of cell suspension with 20 μL of fixative solution (4% PFA and 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) inside a grease pen-circled ring. Dry the slides at 20°C–25°C for ∼1 h.",
    "After the buffer is gone, wash three times with 1×PBST (1×PBS with 0.1% Tween-20) for 5 min each at 20°C–25°C.\n(Optional) Perform antigen retrieval by submerging the slides in boiled 0.01 M sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0).\nNote: It is not advisable to boil the slides directly in the buffer, as it likely causes cell detaching off the slides. In contrast, microwave the buffer tank until it becomes boiling (>95°C). Then immerse the slides in the boiled buffer till it cools down. Repeat this process to ensure the slides are heated > 30 min in the citrate buffer.\nWash three times with 1×PBST for 5 min each at 20°C–25°C.\nFor nuclear antigens, permeabilize the samples with 0.5% Triton X-100 in 1×PBST, for 15 min at 20°C–25°C.\nWash three times with 1×PBST for 5 min each at 20°C–25°C.\nBlock the slides with 5% BSA (Blocking buffer) for 1 h at 20°C–25°C.\nRemove the excess blocking buffer, incubated with primary antibodies as follows:\nPNA (1:1000 dilution in blocking buffer) that stains the acrosome in round and elongating spermatids;\nDDX4 antibody (1:200 dilution in blocking buffer) that labels chromatoid body (CB) in round spermatids;\nγH2AX antibody (1:800 dilution in blocking buffer) that recognizes sex body (XY body) in meiotic spermatocytes;\nSYCP3 antibody (1:400 dilution in blocking buffer) that recognizes the lateral element of the synaptonemal complex.\nIncubate the slides at 4°C for 12 h in a light-proof humidified chamber.\nThe next day, recover the slides to 20°C–25°C for 30 min. Wash three times with 1×PBST for 5 min each at 20°C–25°C.\nIncubate slides with secondary antibodies diluted in 5% BSA (CoraLite 488-conjugated Goat Anti-Mouse, 1:500; Rhodamine (TRITC)-conjugated Goat Anti-Rabbit, 1:500), for 1 h at 20°C–25°C in a dark humidified chamber.\nWash three times with 1×PBST for 5 min each at 20°C–25°C.",
    "Remove the excess buffer by tapping one corner of the slide on the desk gently and add ∼10 μL of mounting medium (Antifade Mountant with DAPI, Invitrogen). Cover the samples with appropriate coverslips.\nImage the samples with a wide-field Leica THUNDER Imager microscopy. Images can be processed using the Image J software."
