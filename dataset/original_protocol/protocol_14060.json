    "This animal protocol was approved by the local committee for animal care (LANUV, Recklinghausen, Germany; protocol no. 84-02.04.2015) and was performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the use of live animals (NIH publication No. 85-23, revised 1996).\n1. ALI induction\nUse adult C57BL/6 mice at ages of about 10-12 weeks. House the animals in individually ventilated cages with free access to water and standard rodent chow. However, it is possible to perform this approach on younger animals and with other mice strains.\nStore LPS (Escherichia coli O111:B4) in aliquots in concentrations of 5 mg/mL at -20 °C. For intratracheal instillation, dilute LPS in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to a final concentration of 2,000 µg/mL.\nWeigh the mouse. Inject ketamine [120 mg/kg mouse bodyweight (BW)] and xylazine (16 mg/kg BW) intraperitoneally (lower one-third of the abdomen, paramedian), and wait until the onset of anesthesia.\nCheck the depth of anesthesia by inducing a tactile stimulus. In case of insufficient anesthesia, repeat the injection with ketamine (30 mg/kg BW) and xylazine (4 mg/kg BW).\nPlace the mouse in prone position on a temperature-controlled table to maintain a body temperature of 37 °C.\nApply sterile ophthalmic lubricant to prevent desiccation of corneas under anesthesia.\nLift the head and hook incisors on a horizontal bar positioned approximately 5 cm above the table while the forepaws remain in close contact with the table. Super-extend the neck in a 90° angle relative to the table (Figure 1). Hold the tongue with forceps to straighten the throat for easier intubation conditions.",
    "Cut a 22 gauge (G) venous catheter to a length of 20 mm. Gently insert the catheter in the vertical direction along the tongue’s root. Place a cold-light source on the skin above the larynx to help visualize the vocal chords and aim for the trachea. If resistance of the larynx occurs, retract the catheter a few millimeters before advancing again.\nInsert the catheter approximately 10 mm into the trachea. Ensure that the insertion is not too deep as this will result in unilateral instillation of fluid into the right or left main bronchus.\nInject LPS (5 µg/g BW) diluted in PBS using a pipette [injected volume depends on mouse bodyweight (e.g., 20 g bodyweight → use 50 µL of LPS solution)].\n\tNOTE: The mouse will typically respond with coughing or gasping to proper instillation of fluid into the trachea.\nConnect a syringe and add a bolus of 50 μL air to assure that complete liquid volume is distributed in the lungs. Slowly remove the catheter.\nKeep the mouse's upper body in an upright position for 30 s to avoid leakage of the fluid from the trachea.\nIn sham-operated animals, inject 50 µL of sterile PBS intratracheally instead of LPS.\nInject buprenorphine hydrochloride 0.08 mg/kg BW subcutaneously into the loose skin over the neck immediately following ALI induction and every 12 h thereafter, during the first 48 h.\nMaintain a body temperature of 37 °C until full awareness is regained by keeping the mouse on the warming pad.\nTransfer the mouse into an individually ventilated cage with free access to food and water. Monitor the mouse regularly. Decreasing body temperature and respiratory depression indicates proper induction of ALI. \n2. Blood sampling, bronchoalveolar lavage, organ harvesting",
    "NOTE: Timing of euthanization depends on the scientific issue addressed. Usually, it is performed 12-72 h following LPS instillation3,4,9,10. Severity of ALI can be determined clinically by regular observation of body temperature and respiratory distress symptoms11.\nInduce anesthesia by placing the mouse in a chamber flooded with isoflurane. Use 3 vol% isoflurane with an oxygen flow of 1 L/min. Ensure deep narcosis by inducing a tactile stimulus. In case of insufficient depth of anesthesia, increase isoflurane up to 5 vol%.\nSacrifice the mouse in deep anesthesia by atlanto-occipital dislocation.\nFix the mouse with tape on an operation table and shortly disinfect the fur over the abdomen with 70% ethanol. Open the abdominal cavity carefully in the median line with scissors and tweezers. Remove parts of the intestine to achieve access to the vena cava inferior (IVC) right to the vertebral column and the abdominal aorta.\nLocate the kidney veins and insert a bent 23 G canula connected to a 1 mL syringe into the IVC directly below the confluence of the veins. Aspirate 250 µL of blood and transfer into a 1.5 mL tube filled with 20 µL of 0.5 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution. Shake gently to facilitate EDTA mixing and put the tube on ice.\nFor bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), prepare three 1 mL syringes with 0.5 mL of sterile PBS and 0.1 mL of air each. Shortly disinfect the fur of the throat with 70% ethanol and carefully expose the trachea with scissors and tweezers. Mobilize the trachea and wrap around a suture.",
    "Perform BAL: Puncture the trachea using micro-scissors and insert a 22 G venous catheter cut to a length of 20 mm. Fix the catheter with the suture and instillate 0.5 mL of sterile PBS and 0.1 mL of air. Aspirate the fluid after 60 s. Repeat the procedure with the additional two syringes and collect the whole aspirate in a 15 mL tube on ice.\nCarefully open the thorax with scissors and tweezers to harvest the lungs. Cut the diaphragm along the costal margin and cut through the ribs with two lateral incisions. Carefully avoid puncturing the lungs. Lift the sternum cranially and fix or remove it.\nPrepare two 10 mL syringes with 37 °C warm PBS (without calcium and magnesium). Make a small incision into the left ventricle. Puncture the right ventricle with a 26 G canula and flush the pulmonary circulation with the prewarmed PBS. Be aware of the lungs turning pale during the procedure. \nRemove the right lobe of the lungs and cut it in two halves. Snap-freeze them in liquid nitrogen, followed by long-term storage at -80 °C for further gene expression and protein analysis.\nRemove the whole left lung and homogenize it in a 48 well plate by mincing the tissue with scissor and tweezer. Incubate the tissue in 2 mL of digestion buffer [RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 0.1% NaN3, collagenase I (1 mg/mL), and DNase II (7 mg/mL)] at 37 °C for 60 min. Perform further homogenization by careful pipetting of the lung tissue pieces up and down.\n3. Tissue preparation for FACS analysis",
    "Prepare fresh FACS buffer (Table 1): always use calcium- and magnesium-free PBS to reduce cation-dependent cell-to-cell adhesion and prevent clumping. Supplement with FCS (1%) to protect cells from apoptosis, prevent non-specific staining, and prevent cells from sticking to the FACS tubes. Include EDTA (0.5 mM) to prevent cation-based cell-to-cell adhesion when working with sticky and adherent cells like macrophages. Add sodium azide (0.1%), as it prevents bacterial contamination and photobleaching of fluorochromes and blocks antibody shedding.\nTransfer the blood samples (step 2.4) into 5 mL FACS tubes and gently mix the blood with 2 mL of red blood cell lysis buffer. Put the tubes on ice and terminate the reaction after 2 min by adding 2 mL of ice-cold PBS. Centrifuge the samples for 5 min at 400 x g and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the cell pellet with 60 µL of FACS buffer and process for subsequent FACS staining according to previously described protocols12.\n\tNOTE: Timing of euthanization of the mouse influences leukocyte count as part of the systemic inflammation. Therefore, it is recommended to adjust the cell number to 1 x 106 cells/60 µL in this step to achieve the best staining results for flow cytometry analysis.\nCentrifuge BAL fluid (step 2.6) for 5 min at 400 x g. Aspirate the supernatant and freeze it in liquid nitrogen, followed by long-term storage at -80 °C for further protein analysis. Resuspend BAL cell pellet with 2 mL of cold FACS buffer, then transfer the suspension into a 5 mL FACS tube using a 100 µm mesh filter to restrain hairs.\nAgain, centrifuge the sample for 5 min at 400 x g. Resuspend the pellet with 60 µL of FACS buffer and process for subsequent FACS staining according to previously described protocols12.",

Therefore, it is recommended to adjust the cell number to 1 x 106 cells/60 µL in this step to achieve the best staining results for flow cytometry analysis.\nTransfer the digested left lung tissue (step 2.10) into a 5 mL FACS tube using a 100 µL mesh filter to extract clumps and terminate the digestion process by adding 2 mL of ice-cold FACS buffer. Centrifuge the sample for 5 min at 400 x g. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 60 µL of FACS buffer and process for subsequent FACS staining according to previously described protocols12.\n\tNOTE: Timing of euthanization of the mouse influences leukocyte count in lung tissue as part of the inflammation. Therefore, it is recommended to adjust the cell number to 1 x 106 cells/60 µL to achieve the best staining results for flow cytometry analysis.\nFor FACS analysis, incubate cells with CD16/CD32 antibody at 4 °C for 15 min to block non-specific binding of immunoglobulin to the Fc receptors. Add 20 µL of blocking solution to 1 x 106 cells in 60 µL in a 5 mL tube.\nMeanwhile, prepare a master mix with FACS buffer and antibodies as described in Table 2.\nAfter blocking, do not wash the cells. Add 20 µL of antibody master mix per sample to obtain a final volume of 100 µL. Incubate the samples for 20 min in the dark at 4 °C.\nWash each sample with 1 mL of FACS buffer and centrifuge for 5 min at 400 x g. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with FACS buffer to the appropriate cell concentration for FACS measurements.",
    "NOTE: A cell number of 1 x 106 cells/500 µL is suggested to achieve the best immune phenotyping results in FACS analysis with this protocol. However, it is recommended that antibodies have to be titrated individually.\nIf required, add live/dead staining prior to the surface staining using specific commercially available kits8.\nFinally, add fixed numbers of commercially available fluorochrome-coupled calibration beads (3 x 105 beads in 20 µL of FACS buffer) to each sample to determine absolute cell numbers12. The gating strategy for blood, BAL, and tissue cells is shown in Figure 2.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
