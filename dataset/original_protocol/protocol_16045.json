    "The first procedure for implementing the ARF-AID system is to establish ARF-TIR1 progenitor cells, as shown in Figure 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-fig-0002]. This protocol outlines the procedure of transfection, antibiotic selection, clonal cell expansion, confirmation of genetic integration, and freezing of the genetically modified progenitor cell lines.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/86ed80b7-e49f-4cf3-93ba-458e9e4007f8/cpmb124-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nGeneration of a stable progenitor cell line that expresses the components of the ARF-AID system at a safe harbor locus. (A) A stepwise strategy to integrate eGFP-ARF and TIR expressed from a CMV promoter. CRISPR is used to target the multicistronic construct into the AAVS1 locus. Primers F and R1 generate a PCR amplicon of 7256 bp if the construct is inserted and an amplicon of 1892 bp if the construct is not inserted. R2 primer recognizes a sequence internal to the TIR1 gene, so the primer combination F and R2 amplifies only if the construct inserts into the AAVS1 locus. (B) Clones show either heterozygous or homozygous integration of the insert. Compare the bands between the unintegrated (U) and integrated clones (HT, heterozygous; HO, homozygous). The clone in the fourth lane has one allele integrated and a deletion in the other allele. (C) Western blotting confirms that the eGFP-ARF and TIR1 proteins are expressed (right lane) compared to the unmodified HEK293T cells (left lane).\nNOTE: Only one of the two plasmids listed below will be used to generate a progenitor line. As described in Background Information, first try using pMGS56 (eGFP-ARF) to generate the progenitor cell line. If you find that the cell line is refractory to transfection or genetic editing, try using the ARF-HA plasmid (pMGS46), which is smaller and more easily incorporated.\nMaterials\nHEK293T cells (ATCC CRL-3216)\nHEK293T growth medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-rec-0001])\nPBS (Gibco 10010023)\nTrypsin 0.05% (Gibco 25300054)\nOpti-MEM I reduced-serum medium (Gibco 31985-070)",

Grow HEK293T cells in HEK293T growth medium for 2 days to ∼80% confluency in a 10-cm culture plate.\n2. Remove medium from HEK293T cells and store in a 50-ml conical tube at 4°C until step 15.\n3. Wash the cells with PBS and add 0.5 ml 0.05% trypsin to the plate. Incubate the cells for 2-3 min, rinse, and collect the cells with 10 ml medium.",
    "4. Centrifuge the cells 5 min at 500 × g using a swinging-bucket centrifuge, remove supernatant, and resuspend the cells in 10 ml fresh medium.\nThroughout this protocol, all centrifugation spins should be performed at room temperature unless otherwise stated.\n5. Count cells with a hemocytometer, and seed 2.0-3 × 105 cells per well in a six-well plate, to achieve 30%-40% confluency per well the next day.\n6. Add 125 µl Opti-MEM I reduced-serum medium in two 1.5-ml tubes for each transfection; label one tube with the description of the DNA sample and the other as Lipofectamine. Add 5 µl p3000 reagent (provided with Lipofectamine 3000 reagent) to the tube labeled DNA sample. Add 5 µl Lipofectamine 3000 reagent to the tube labeled Lipofectamine\nPerforming many simultaneous transfections increases the chances that you will isolate a homozygous insertion. The protocol is designed for four experimental transfections and two negative controls (parental sgRNA/Cas9 vector and untransfected) per six-well plate.\nTransfection reagents or methods of introducing foreign DNA into cells will vary by cell line. Here, we describe the use of Lipofectamine 3000, which works efficiently for HEK293T cells.\n7. Add 1 µg AAVS1 sgRNA and 1 µg of either eGFP-ARF-P2A-TIR1 or ARF-HA-P2A-TIR1 plasmid to the p3000 reagent mixture. Mix by pipetting up and down three times. In parallel, add 1 µg of the parental vector pX458 and the respective ARF-TIR1 plasmid to the negative control tube.\nFor HEK293T cells, we recommend a ratio of 2.5 µl Lipofectamine per microgram of DNA. If the transfection efficiency is low, increase the amounts of Lipofectamine 3000 and p3000 reagents.",
    "8. For each transfection, transfer the Lipofectamine mixture (step 6) to the DNA/p3000 mixture (step 7) dropwise slowly. This tube now contains ∼260 µl of transfection reagents, DNA, and Opti-MEM medium. Mix by pipetting up and down three times with the same pipette tip.\n9. Incubate 15 min at room temperature, and transfer the DNA complex into the cells dropwise in a serpentine pattern to uniformly distribute the reagent across the plate.\n10. Rock the plate sideways four times and front to back four times to distribute the reagent evenly over the cells—do not swirl the plate. Place cells in the incubator and incubate for 24 hr.\n11. Replace the medium with fresh medium, and allow the cells to grow undisturbed for an additional 24 hr.\n12. Expand each well of the six-well plate into a 10-cm plate with 10 ml medium as described in steps 3 and 4, and grow for an additional 24-72 hr.\nThe first time that you implement this protocol, we recommend that you grow the cells for an additional 24 hr at this point. However, if you find that there are fewer than 10 colonies total in step 17, in subsequent implementations of this step, increase the time to 72 hr.\n13. Add 1 µl 10 mg/ml puromycin directly to the 10-cm plate of cells and swirl the medium around the plate. Leave cells under selection for 3 days.\n14. Replace with fresh medium containing 1 µg/ml puromycin, and continue selection for 2 days.",
    "After 5 total days, if there are many remaining live cells in the negative control plate, then replace with fresh medium containing puromycin and continue selection for an additional 2 days, for a total of 7 days. After 5-7 days under selection, all the cells in the untransfected control well should be dead.\n15. Transfer the conditioned medium from step 2 into a 10-ml syringe and equip with a 0.22-µm syringe filter. Filter the medium into a fresh 50-ml conical tube.\nConditioned medium is stable for 2-3 months at 4°C.\n16. Add 8 ml growth medium to 2 ml of this conditioned medium. Remove selection medium from the plates and replace with the 8:2 mixture to expand the colonies.\nAllow colonies to grow and expand. Usually, it takes 2-3 weeks for colonies to appear after the start of puromycin selection (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-fig-0002]), but the time frame is variable and dependent upon the cell line. Check the plate under a microscope and scan for colonies that appear after 2 weeks. The presence of 5-10 times more colonies in the transfected plates compared to the control plasmid-transfected or untransfected plates suggests successful integration of the plasmid. The control sgRNA plasmid transfected plates often contain some colonies, but far fewer.\nPicking colonies\n17. Mark individual colonies on the bottom of the plate using a marker. Check for the presence of eGFP-ARF-P2A-TIR1 cells using a fluorescent microscope to identify GFP-positive colonies. Select colonies in which all the cells in the colony exhibit uniform nuclear expression of GFP. In the case of the ARF-HA-P2A-TIR1-transfected cells, you should select all colonies.\n18. Carefully pick individual colonies by using 10 µl 0.05% trypsin solution and a 20-µl micropipettor (P20 pipette) set to 20 µl. Alternatively, use cloning cylinders to pick individual colonies.",
    "For hand-picking colonies without the use of cloning cylinders: (1) hold the plate at a 45° angle to pool the medium away from the colonies; (2) use a P20 pipette set to 20 µl and aspirate ∼10 µl of trypsin solution into the pipette tip; (3) dispense a few microliters of the trypsin solution onto the colony such that a small droplet is formed between the plate and the pipette tip, taking care not to dispense so much that the droplet rolls down the plate; (4) scrape the colony with the pipette tip while the trypsin medium remains as a bridge between the plate and the tip; and (5) once the colony is dislodged, aspirate the cells into the tip and transfer of the entire colony to the 96-well plate. Resuspend the colonies in 200 µl medium and transfer into 24-well plates containing 1 ml medium per well.\nUsing cloning cylinders: (1) dispense silicone grease onto a glass petri dish and autoclave it along with a pair of forceps; (2) aspirate medium from the plate and wash with PBS; (3) hold the plate at a 45° angle to pool the PBS away from the colonies; (4) use forceps to pick up a cloning cylinder, dip the thicker edge into silicone grease, and place it over the colony; (5) add 20 µl of trypsin solution and incubate at 37°C until cells begin to detach; (6) resuspend the colony in 100 µl medium and transfer into a 24-well plate containing 1 ml medium per well.\n19. Wait for the cells to reach confluency before continuing, which can take between 5 and 8 days for HEK293T cells.\nExpanding cells",
    "20. Collect cells by pipetting up and down, transfer 100 µl from a well of the 24-well plate into a well of a fresh 24-well plate containing 1 ml medium, and continue passaging the cells. Transfer the remaining ∼0.9 ml into a 1.5-ml tube.\nThe plate allows the expansion of the positive colonies. HEK293T cells attach loosely to the plate, so pipetting is enough to dislodge the cells. For other cell lines, collect cells by trypsinization.\n21. Aliquot 100 µl of the 0.9 ml within the 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube into a fresh tube for genomic DNA isolation and PCR. Place cells immediately on ice.\n22. Centrifuge the remaining 0.8 ml of cells for 2 min at 6000 × g using a fixed-angle rotor tabletop centrifuge, and remove medium.\n23. Add 100 µl 2× SDS sample buffer (Laemmli buffer) and mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down to generate cell lysate for western blotting. As a negative control, prepare cell lysate from the parental HEK293T cells.\n24. Heat the lysates at 95°C for 5 min on a heating block and vortex for 10 s. Place back on the heating block for another 5 min. Briefly centrifuge the samples at 5000 × g, and store at −20°C.\nScreening for genomic integration at the AAVS1 locus\nTo screen the integration of ARF-TIR1 at the AAVS1 locus, we use genomic PCR using primers that amplify the integrated plasmid DNA.\n25. Centrifuge cells from step 21 for 2 min at 6000 × g using a fixed-angle rotor tabletop centrifuge, remove medium, and either flash freeze or proceed immediately with gDNA isolation. As a negative control, also freeze cells or proceed with gDNA isolation from parental HEK293T cells.",
    "Use any genomic DNA isolation kit or conventional phenol-chloroform extraction to isolate DNA from the cells. Here, we used a Qiagen genomic DNA isolation kit. The method described here is adapted from the kit's manual with minor changes (DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit, 69504).\n26. Resuspend the cells in 200 µl PBS and add 20 µl proteinase K (from kit).\n27. Lyse cells by adding 200 µl Buffer AL (from kit) and mixing thoroughly by vortexing to form a homogenous lysate.\n28. Incubate samples 10 min at 56°C.\n29. Add 200 µl 100% ethanol and vortex.\n30. Transfer the lysate into a DNeasy Mini spin column placed in a 2-ml collection tube.\n31. Spin 1 min at maximum speed in a tabletop centrifuge (10,000-17,000 × g) and discard the flowthrough.\n32. Place the spin column back into the collection tube and add 500 µl Buffer AW1 (from kit). Spin 1 min at 10,000-17,000 × g and discard the flowthrough.\n33. Place the spin column back into the collection tube, and wash by adding 500 µl Buffer AW2 (from kit) and centrifuging 1 min at 10,000-17,000 × g.\n34. Discard the flowthrough and centrifuge again for 2 min at maximum speed.\n35. Place the spin column into a 1.5-ml tube and add 100 µl nuclease-free water to the center of the column. Incubate 2-3 min at room temperature. Spin 2 min at 9000 × g.\nCentrifuging at 9000 × g reduces the chance of breaking off the microcentrifuge tube's lid.\n36. Quantify DNA using NanoDrop spectrophotometer or similar instrument and store at −20°C.\nGenomic DNA PCR\n37. Make a PCR master mix by adding all the components for the required number of reactions, using the following amounts per reaction:\n         \ntable:\n﻿0,1\n10 µM primer F,1.0 µl",
    "10 µM primer R1 or R2,1.0 µl\n10× High Fidelity buffer (provided with enzyme),2.5 µl\n100% DMSO,0.5 µl\n10 mM dNTP mix,1.0 µl\n50 mM MgSO4 (provided with enzyme),1.0 µl\nPlatinum Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity,0.5 µl\nNuclease-free water,12.5 µl\n38. Aliquot 20 µl of the master mix into 0.2-ml PCR tubes and add 5 µl of 10 ng/µl genomic DNA into each reaction mix. Use the parental HEK293T DNA as a negative control. Perform PCR using the following conditions:\n         \ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\nInitial step:,5 min,95°C,(denaturation)\n30 cycles:,30 s,95°C,\n,30 s,59°C,(annealing)\n,7 min,68°C,(extension)\nFinal:,10 min,68°C,\nHold:,∞,4°C,\nGel electrophoresis\n39. Prepare a 1% agarose gel with 1× TAE buffer.\n40. Add 5 µl 6× Orange-G Loading Dye directly to the PCR tubes and load onto the 1% agarose gel.\n41. Run the samples for 60 min at a constant 90 V.\n42. Stain the gel with SYBR Safe DNA gel stain diluted 1:10,000 with 1× TAE buffer (or 0.5 µg/ml ethidium bromide) for 10 min, and wash twice with 1× TAE for 10 min each.\n43. Visualize the bands using a UV transilluminator (see Figs. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-fig-0002] and B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-fig-0002]).\nThe negative control produces an amplicon of 1892 base pairs (bp) with genomic F and R1 primers, whereas successful homozygous integration of the construct produces an amplicon of 7256 bp; heterozygous integration yields both amplicons. The PCR using the AAVS1GenomicF (F) and Internal Primer (R2) primers produce a 4677-bp amplicon only in the integrated cells, and not in the negative and control cells (Figs. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-fig-0002] and B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-fig-0002]).\nConfirmation of the clones by western blotting\nIntegration of the ARF and TIR1 genes at the AAVS1 locus does not necessarily mean the genes are expressed. Use western blotting to test whether ARF and TIR1 proteins are present in the cell.",
    "44. Select homozygously integrated ARF/TIR1 clones from the PCR screen.\n45. Thaw the frozen protein lysate (step 24), and heat again for 3-5 min at 95°C.\n46. Separate proteins by loading 10 µl of the samples on a 10% acrylamide gel, transfer the proteins onto nitrocellulose or PVDF membrane, block membrane with 7.5% nonfat dry milk, and probe with anti-GFP or anti-HA and anti-TIR1 antibodies. Anti-β-actin (1:5000; Sigma, A1978) can be used as a loading control. A detailed western blotting protocol is available at https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/0471142727.mb1008s114[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/0471142727.mb1008s114] (Ni, Xu, & Gallagher, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-bib-0024]). Include the parental cell lysate from step 24 as a negative control (Fig. 2C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-fig-0002]).\nAfter both insertion and expression are confirmed by genomic PCR and western blotting, respectively, the construct should be sequenced to confirm that mutations were not incorporated during the process.\n47. Label an appropriate number of cryogenic storage vials—usually 5-10 vials per 10-cm culture plate. Freeze down ten 10-cm plates, for a total of 50-100 vials for each verified progenitor cell.\n48. Remove medium from an ∼80%-100% confluent 10-cm plate of progenitor cells and wash with PBS. Add 0.5 ml 0.05% trypsin to the plate. Incubate the cells for 2-3 min in the incubator, rinse, and collect cells with 10 ml of medium into a 15-ml conical tube.\n49. Count cells using a hemocytometer.\n50. Add 0.5 ml of the above cells into 9.5 ml fresh medium and plate into a 10-cm plate to maintain a backup plate. Keep this plate until the viability of the frozen cells has been tested and confirmed.\n51. Centrifuge the cells from step 48 for 5 min at 500 × g, and remove the ∼10 ml of medium-diluted trypsin.",
    "52. Resuspend cells with freezing medium (prepared by adding 1 ml 100% DMSO to 9 ml HEK293T growth medium) to a final concentration of 1 × 106 to 3 × 106 cells/ml. Transfer 1-ml aliquots of cells into each prelabeled freezing vial and close the vial.\n53. Place the vial into a freezing container and store at least 24 hr in a −80°C freezer. Transfer the frozen vials into a liquid nitrogen tank.\n54. Twenty-four hours after storing in the liquid nitrogen, remove one vial from the liquid nitrogen and quickly thaw the cells in a 37°C water bath for 2-4 min.\n55. Transfer the cells into a 15-ml conical tube containing 10 ml medium. Centrifuge cells 5 min at 500 × g and remove medium.\n56. Resuspend cells in 10 ml fresh medium and plate into a 10-cm tissue culture plate. Incubate in tissue culture incubator.\n57. After 24 hr, check the viability of the newly thawed cells under a microscope.\nThese frozen cell lines will serve as the progenitor cell line for tagging genes of interest with full-length AID.",
    "Fusion of the AID tag to the target gene via HDR requires the specific introduction of a double strand break near the gene of interest, and this can be done using CRISPR-Cas9. This protocol first outlines the design of sgRNAs to both the 5´ and 3´ ends of the gene of interest using Benchling (https://www.benchling.com/[href=https://www.benchling.com/]).

Return to the tab with the imported sequence, click “copy the primer list,” and paste the sequences for all generated oligonucleotides into a spreadsheet.\nThe two oligonucleotides (FWD and REV) can be synthesized for downstream cloning.\nAlternatively, choose the 20-nt target sequence without the PAM and add overhangs to clone into pX458 as follows: If the sequence does not start with a G, add a G to the 5′ end. Append 5′-CACC-3′ to the 5′ end of the forward sequence and 5′-AAAC-3′ to the 5′ end of the reverse complement of the target sequence, ensuring that the 3′ base is the complementing C nucleotide.

Confirm the sgRNA insertion by sequencing using the LKO.1 5′ primer or the U6 promoter primer.\nTesting sgRNA using Surveyor assay\nThe double-stranded DNA breaks generated by CRISPR-Cas9 are typically repaired by error-prone nonhomologous repair, which results in several types of mutations, including indels. The mutated PCR products, when annealed with the wild type or other mutated PCR products, generate a mismatch proximal to the cut site. The Surveyor enzymes recognize this mismatch and cleave the heteroduplex at the site of mismatch, producing two smaller fragments that can be resolved on a gel (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-fig-0003]). Therefore, this assay confirms the efficiency of sgRNA in making double stranded DNA cuts at the desired site.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/10fef2dd-1861-4ada-8fdf-e0e257155961/cpmb124-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3",

Replace medium with 2 ml fresh medium, and incubate for an additional 48 hr.\nGFP in the pX458 plasmid allows easy assessment of the transfection efficiency. Observe the transfected cells under a fluorescent microscope using a green filter. Higher transfection rates make it easier to assess the efficacy of the sgRNA using the Surveyor assay.\n45. Remove 1 ml medium, collect the cells in the remaining 1 ml medium by pipetting up and down, and transfer into a 1.5-ml tube.\n46.

We recommend Platinum Taq DNA polymerase or Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity for genomic PCR. For each primer set, it is necessary to determine the annealing temperature empirically. We find that an annealing temperature within 3° of the lowest melting temperature (Tm) works well. Additionally, adding denaturants such as DMSO or Betaine may help to amplify GC-rich genomic regions.\n52. Add 5 µl of PCR product to 2 µl 6× Orange-G Loading Dye and place on ice.\n53.

    "Homology-directed repair (HDR) is the mechanism by which AID is translationally fused to the N or C terminus of the target gene. CRISPR-Cas9 is directed to the region of interest by the sgRNA, and this complex cleaves double-stranded DNA, which can be repaired by nonhomologous end joining or homologous recombination/repair. For C-terminal fusions, the repair construct consists of AID separated from the hygromycin-resistance gene (HygR) by a porcine teschovirus-1 ribosomal skipping sequence (P2A; Kim et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-bib-0017]; Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-fig-0004]).

In both cases, the AID is separated from the protein of interest by adding a linker sequence of 6-9 amino acids (2-3× GGS).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/78d782e8-06d3-4986-b07b-03b51940eba8/cpmb124-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nStrategy for designing the HDR constructs for the N and C termini.

PCR products are gel purified and used as an HDR template.\nThe HDR construct can be PCR products or cloned into a plasmid. So, the first step in the HDR construct synthesis is designing primers to amplify the HDR template either for cloning into a plasmid (Elion, Marina, & Yu, 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-bib-0009a]) or for direct transfection of the PCR product.

Grow the ARF-TIR1 progenitor cells, split into a six-well plate with 2-3 × 105 cells seeded per well, and collect conditioned medium as described in steps 2 and 15 of Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-prot-0001].\n2. Cotransfect 1 µg of gene-specific sgRNA plasmid and 400 ng of double-stranded HDR template PCR product to the cells as described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-prot-0001], steps 6-10. Use 5-7.5 µl Lipofectamine reagent for transfection.\nThe parental pX458 cotransfected with HDR PCR product is used as a transfection control, and we recommend keeping an untransfected control cell well. Transfect multiple (at least four) wells to obtain a sufficient number of colonies.",
    "3. Replace the medium with fresh medium, and allow the cells to grow undisturbed for an additional 24 hr.\n4. Expand each well into a 10-cm plate and incubate for 24-72 hr.\nThe first time that you implement this protocol, we recommend that you grow the cells for an additional 24 hr. However, if you find that there are fewer than 10 colonies total in step 8, in subsequent implementations of this step, increase the time to 72 hr.\nExpanding cells into 10-cm plates ensures that the cells are sufficiently sparse to allow colonies to form in isolation.\n5. Add 20 µl hygromycin B to a final concentration of 100 µg/ml and swirl the medium. Alternatively, add an empirically determined concentration as described in Strategic Planning.\n6. Replace with fresh medium containing 100 µg/ml hygromycin B and continue selection for 3 days.\n7. Monitor the cells daily until all the cells in the control plate are dead (7-12 days), and then replace the medium with a mixture of 8 ml growth medium and 2 ml conditioned medium.\n8. Colonies will appear in the plates after 2 or 3 weeks.\n9. Pick colonies and expand cells as described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-prot-0001], steps 17-24, and screen for tagged clones by western blotting and gDNA PCR.",
    "In order to quantify the relative levels of the protein, use antibodies specific for the protein of interest, as opposed to α-AID antibodies. Protein-specific antibodies are necessary to quantify the tagged protein levels relative to the progenitor cells in the subsequent protocol. Successful tagging results in an increase in protein size of 24 kDa. Heterozygous integration will contain bands reflecting both the native and tagged proteins. Nonhomologous end repair is error prone and may result in an unexpected size shift that is not ∼24 kDa. Here, you are only determining whether the clonal cell lines exhibit an appropriate size shift and whether they are homozygous. Basic Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-prot-0007] is used to determine the relative expression level of the tagged protein compared to the progenitor. Confirm the integration and reading frame of the integrated AID-P2A-HygR or HygR-P2A-AID by PCR and sequencing; see below.\n10. Select colonies from the western blotting experiment and perform genomic DNA PCR using the same set of primers used for testing sgRNA efficiency according to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-prot-0002], steps 48-51, except with the PCR extension time increased to 4 min to amplify the insert.\n11. Run the whole PCR product on 1% agarose gel, excise the band using a clean scalpel, and use the Qiagen gel purification kit to isolate genomic DNA (follow Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-prot-0002], steps 19-29). Sequence the purified PCR product with the forward primer to confirm the reading frame.\n12. Freeze the cell lines as described in steps 47-57 of Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-prot-0001].",
    "All AID systems necessitate the expression of TIR1, so there are many progenitor cell lines and organisms already available that express TIR1 (Holland, Fachinetti, Han, & Cleveland, 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-bib-0014]; Li, Prasanna, Salo, Vattulainen, & Ikonen, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-bib-0020]; Natsume, Kiyomitsu, Saga, & Kanemaki, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-bib-0023]; Nishimura et al., 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-bib-0025]; Zhang, Ward, Cheng, & Dernburg, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-bib-0039]). In an effort to repurpose these cell lines and organisms but alleviate chronic degradation of target proteins, one can fuse the AID tag with ARF using a flexible linker to create the AID-ARF clamp (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-fig-0006]). This protocol covers tagging of the C-terminus of the protein of interest with the AID-ARF clamp using Addgene plasmid no. 138174. Here, we describe the procedure to tag ZNF143 at the C-terminus with the AID-ARF fusion protein (Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-fig-0007]) using the sgRNA and the donor primers given in the Materials list.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/39370a8b-46af-4930-ba42-32f3660c1a01/cpmb124-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\nAn overview of the components and their roles in engineered ARF-AID systems. The ARF-AID system (left) differs from traditional AID systems due to the presence of the ARF-PB1 domain, which binds to the AID tag and prevents auxin-independent AID degradation. The AID-ARF clamp system (right) fuses the ARF-PB1 domain to the AID tag, which also protects AID from auxin-independent degradation. An advantage of the clamp system is that previously generated TIR1-expressing cells and animals can be used as the progenitors for protein tagging. In both systems, auxin facilitates interaction between AID and TIR1 to mediate rapid degradation.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/828e98a7-8dc7-4d18-932f-e1882cb989b7/cpmb124-fig-0007-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 7\nThe AID-ARF clamp system facilitates the rapid auxin-inducible degradation of the AID-ARF-tagged proteins.

If TIR1-expressing progenitor cells are available, proceed to step 2 and directly tag the protein of interest with the AID-ARF clamp using pMGS59. Alternatively, you need to generate a TIR1-expressing progenitor cell using the TIR1 plasmid developed by the Kanemaki lab (Natsume et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-bib-0023]; Addgene no. 72834) and the sgRNA that targets the AAVS1 locus (Addgene no. 126582). Follow Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-prot-0001], steps 1-57, to generate progenitor cells using this construct.\n2. To tag the protein of interest with the ARF-AID clamp in the TIR1 progenitor cells, follow Basic Protocols 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-prot-0002], 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-prot-0003], and 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-prot-0005]. The only differences are the progenitor cells (TIR1 as opposed to ARF/TIR1) and the HDR template. Use the AID-ARF-P2A-Hygromycin plasmid (Addgene no. 138174) to generate the HDR template.",
    "Before using the AID-tagged cell lines to study the effect of acute protein depletion, use the following protocol to quantify the protein expression of the AID-tagged protein in comparison with the parental cells and measure the degradation rate upon auxin treatment.\nMaterials\nAID-tagged clones (Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-prot-0005])\nProgenitor cells (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-prot-0001], step 53)\nAuxin (3-indoleacetic acid, sodium salt; Abcam ab146403)\nImageJ software\nQuantify the expression level of the AID-tagged protein\n1. Thaw AID-tagged clones and progenitor cells and culture as described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-prot-0001], steps 54-56. Wait ∼3 days for the cells to reach >80% confluency.\n2. Seed ∼7-8 × 105 of each positive AID-tagged clonal cell line into a well of a six-well plate. The number of six-well plates is determined by the number of sequence-verified clones from Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-prot-0005]. Include a single well for the ARF-TIR1 progenitor line without an AID-tagged protein of interest. Wait 24 hr, which should result in ∼75% confluent cells in each well.\nThe remaining cells can be maintained and passaged, as they will be needed for step 15 below.\n3. Remove 1 ml medium from each well, collect all the cells by pipetting up and down in the remaining medium, and transfer the cells to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Put the cells on ice.\n4. Centrifuge cells immediately after collection using a fixed-angle rotor tabletop centrifuge for 2 min at 6000 × g, 4°C, and carefully remove medium by using a pipette.\n5. Add 200 µl 2× SDS sample buffer directly into the pellet and pipette up and down several times. The lysate will become highly viscous.\nAlternatively, add the 2× SDS sample buffer into the plate after removing the medium to directly lyse the cells. Collect the lysate with a pipette.",
    "6. Heat-denature proteins for 5 min at 95°C, vortex 20 s, and denature again for another 5 min. Store the lysate at −20°C.\n7. Check the expression level of the tagged protein by western blotting (Fig. 7A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-fig-0007]; Fig. 8A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-fig-0008] and B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-fig-0008]). Serially dilute the lysate of the untagged progenitor cell line that expresses ARF and TIR1 to ensure that the query bands of the western are within the linear range of the assay and to compare the level of expression in the tagged clones. Load the serial dilutions of the progenitor control lysate followed by all the AID-tagged clone cell lysates. Continue with western blotting using antibodies directed against the AID-tagged protein (Ni, Xu, & Gallagher, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-bib-0024]); use actin as a loading control.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/89d7097a-1bc2-49bc-b5f5-b9cbc7dd2f54/cpmb124-fig-0008-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 8\nThe ARF-AID system preserves the endogenous expression levels of AID-tagged proteins and facilitates auxin-inducible degradation.

Measure the density of both the protein of interest and corresponding control (actin) bands using ImageJ.\n9. Divide the signal density of the protein of interest by the signal density of the control actin signal to account for loading differences and to obtain the relative intensity of your protein.",
    "10. For the progenitor cell lysate serial dilution, the amount of protein in each lane is known relative to the undiluted sample. Plot the densitometry intensities against the known fraction of cells in the standard curve for both the actin bands and the bands for the protein of interest. Check that the standard curve intensities are linearly correlated to the fraction of cells loaded (Guertin & Lis, 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-bib-0013]). Very intense and very modest bands are most likely to fall outside the liner standard curve. The linear range of the assay is determined by the linear portion of the standard curve.\n11. Fit a linear regression to the standard curve.\nPoints outside the linear range of the assay should not be included in the model.\nIn Microsoft Excel, you can plot a scatter plot of the intensities (y axis) and fraction of cells loaded (x axis), add a linear trendline, and display the equation on the chart.\n12. Plug the protein of interest densitometry intensity into this equation as the y variable and solve for x. This value represents the relative intensity of the protein of interest compared to the progenitor cell line. The measured intensities represent the quantitative range of the assay, and one cannot use the regression formula to extrapolate beyond this range.\nMeasure the degradation rate of the AID-tagged proteins\n13. Prepare 50 mM auxin in water, divide into 500-µl aliquots, and store at −20°C.\nAuxin is stable for several months at −20°C. Use a fresh aliquot each time and do not refreeze.\n14. Label the six wells of the plate: no treatment, 15 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hr, and 3 hr.",
    "15. Choose AID-tagged HEK293T cell lines that express the tagged protein at the most comparable level to the progenitor cell line and seed ∼7-8 × 105 cells in each well of a six-well plate. Wait 24 hr, which should result in ∼75% confluent cells in each well.\nThese cells can be thawed fresh, as described in step 1, or the cells that are being passaged and maintained (see note following step 2) can be used.\n16. Add a final concentration of 500 µM auxin dropwise to the medium all over the plate and mix by moving the plate forward, backward, and sideways. Do not swirl the plate.\n17. Collect cells at regular intervals starting from no auxin treatment. Remove 1 ml of medium from each well and collect cells by pipetting up and down in the remaining medium and transfer the cells to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Put the cells on ice.\nInitially, we recommend time intervals of 15 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hr, and 3 hr, but depending on the degradation rate, subsequent time points should be empirically determined.\nKeeping cells on ice significantly reduces further degradation of the tagged protein.\n18. Centrifuge cells immediately after collection using a fixed-angle rotor tabletop centrifuge for 2 min at 6000 × g, 4°C, and carefully remove medium by using a pipette.\nCentrifugation at 4°C significantly reduces further degradation of the tagged protein.\n19. Add 200 µl 2× SDS sample buffer directly into the pellet and pipette up and down several times. The lysate becomes highly viscous.\nAlternatively, add the 2× SDS sample buffer into the plate after removing the medium to directly lyse the cells. Collect the lysate with a pipette.",
    "20. Heat-denature proteins 5 min at 95°C, vortex 20 s, and denature again for another 5 min. Store the lysate at −20°C.\n21. Check the auxin-induced degradation of the tagged protein by western blotting (Figs. 7B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-fig-0007]-D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-fig-0007] and 8C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-fig-0008]-E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-fig-0008]). Serially dilute the untreated lysate to ensure that the query bands of the western are within the linear range of the assay. Load the serial dilution of the untreated AID-tagged control lysate, and also include the treated cell lysate. Continue with western blotting using antibodies directed against the AID-tagged protein.\nThe degradation of the AID-tagged proteins starts immediately after the addition of auxin.\n22. Measure the density of both the AID-tagged protein and corresponding control (actin) bands using ImageJ. Account for loading differences by dividing the signal for the AID-tagged protein by the signal for the actin control. Normalize the auxin-treated samples to the zero/no treatment timepoint such that the signal at time 0 is equal to 1.\n23. Determine the rate of degradation by plotting the intensity of the AID-tagged protein bands (Figs. 7D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-fig-0007] and 8E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.124#cpmb124-fig-0008]) and fit the data using the following equation (see Internet Resources), where y(t) is the intensity of the protein time point t; y(0) is the initial relative intensity of the protein band, usually ∼1.0; y∞ is the y value that is asymptotically approaching at the infinite time point; k is the rate constant; and t is the time point:\n         imgsrc:/cms/asset/69f4884d-73b7-4cb9-98fd-f0f298ee6c04/cpmb124-math-0001.png"
