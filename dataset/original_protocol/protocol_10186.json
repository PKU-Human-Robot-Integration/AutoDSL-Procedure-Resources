    "The in vivo animal experiments described were performed according to an approved protocol and under the ethical guidelines of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke Ethics Committee for Animal Experiments.\n1. Antibody Peptide Conjugation\nNOTE: ChAcNLS can be synthesized at any commercial peptide manufacturer or university-affiliated peptide synthesis service platform. The synthesis of ChAcNLS can be found in reference 34. For Procedures 1 and 2 use the mAb 7G3, which is specific for the leukemia antigen IL-3Rα 39.\nIn a 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube, prepare a 10 mg/mL (~1 mg total antibody) solution of 7G3 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.6.\nDissolve sulfo-SMCC in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 5-10 mM. Vortexing the solution thoroughly works best in order to achieve complete dissolution.\nAdd to the tube containing 7G3 the dissolved sulfo-SMCC solution (typically between 5-20 μL depending on the molar ratio of sulfo-SMCC-to-7G3 desired). Testing sulfo-SMCC-to-7G3 ratios of 10-, 25-, and 50-to-1 is recommended. Incubate at room temperature for 1 h.\nPurify and concentrate the maleimide-derivatized 7G3 by using an ultrafiltration device and buffer exchange in PBS, pH 7.0. Centrifuge at 8,000 x g for approximately 5 min. Discard flow through and fill with PBS, pH 7.0 and centrifuge again.\nPerform this 7-8 times to completely exchange the buffer. Recover the concentrated 7G3 protein by placing the filter device upside down in a clean microcentrifuge tube. Centrifuge for 2 min at 1,000 x g. Recovery volume should be approximately 0.3 mL\nIn the tube containing the maleimide-activated 7G3, add 2-fold molar excess of ChAcNLS relative to the sulfo-SMCC-to-7G3 ratio used in the previous step and incubate overnight at 4 °C. For example, if a 10-to-1 sulfo-SMCC-to-7G3 ratio was used, then use a 20-to-1 ChAcNLS-to-7G3 ratio. Total volume should not be significantly changed.",
    "NOTE: Although ChAcNLS does not cause precipitation during the conjugation process this is a possibility that could occur with other peptides. Observe the tube during the reaction for signs of precipitation, which is most likely caused when peptides are hydrophobic. In these cases it may be worth revisiting the peptide of interest in order to design changes to provide increased hydrophilicity.\nConcentrate the 7G3-ChAcNLS using an ultrafiltration device to desired concentration and buffer exchange in PBS pH 7.4 (see step 1.4). The recovery yield of total protein should be ≥ 75% of the original starting material.\nPerform SDS-PAGE to evaluate the constructed 7G3-ChAcNLS candidates using a 12% polyacrylamide gel (provides sufficient separation of the ChAcNLS conjugated heavy and light chains from nonconjugated chains). Mix 10 μg of 7G3-ChAcNLS in PAGE loading buffer containing 2 μL β-mercaptoethanol and load into well.\nSet the appropriate voltage (120 V for 1 h for a 12% gel) and run the electrophoresis. Stop the electrophoresis when the Coomassie dye front reaches the bottom of the gel.\n\tNOTE: Do not let the Coomassie dye front run off the gel.\nRemove gel from electrophoresis apparatus and rinse with destaining solution containing 10% v/v of glacial acetic acid and 20% v/v methanol.\nTake a photo of the gel and with a ruler and measure the distance (cm) migrated for the standards and 7G3 conjugates. Calculate the retention factor (Rf) value, which is the distance migrated divided by the gel length (from where protein is loaded to the Coomassie migration front). Plot the molecular weight (MW) in log against the Rf values from each protein standard and extrapolate the size of the 7G3 conjugates.\nCalculate the number of peptides per antibody by dividing the difference in MW between 7G3 conjugates and unmodified 7G3 by 1768.5 g/mol (MW of ChAcNLS).",
    "Take digital images of the Coomassie-stained gel and perform densitometry analysis. At this point, selection of a lead candidate can be based on the AC with the maximum number of ChAcNLS molecules that does not contain significant aggregate species.\n2. Confocal Microscopy for Intracellular Accumulation Evaluation\nNOTE: It is important to test the cell selectivity of intracellular accumulation of the peptide-modified mAbs prior to developing formulations with a payload of interest. Because Tat has also been shown to have a propensity for nonspecific cell penetration, it is worth first analyzing intracellular accumulation and cell selectivity prior to undertaking costly development steps with expensive payloads. For this reason, Procedure 1 should also modify isotype specific irrelevant control mAbs. For the rest of the protocol we will work with ACs modified with 10 ChAcNLS molecules per antibody. A schematic including key steps for Procedures 2 and 3 is described in Figure 2.\nCAUTION: This step of the protocol involves the handling and manipulation of paraformaldehyde. Please follow manufacturer instructions when handling.\nTreat target TF-1a cells with 200 nM of 7G3-ChAcNLS including modified control mAbs. Incubate 5 x 106 antigen-positive cells with the conjugates for 1 h at 37 °C.\nAfter 1 h, remove supernatant and wash with 1 mL 3x in ice-cold PBS. Add fresh media and incubate for an additional hour at 37 °C.\nAfter the additional hour, remove supernatant and wash 3x in 1 mL ice-cold PBS. Add 0.5 mL of PBS containing 0.25% trypsin and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) at 37 °C for 3 up to 30 min.",
    "NOTE: During initial pilot testing it is recommended to not trypsinize cells in order to determine the differences in AC intracellular accumulation. This protocol promotes the use of trypsin and we demonstrate how this improves assessment of intracellular accumulation efficiency of different AC candidates.\n\t\nTest the different times for incubation by visually checking for all cells being detached. In addition, incubate cell aliquots with viability staining solutions and perform flow cytometric analysis as previously described 40.\nNeutralize trypsin with 1.5 mL of cell culture RPMI 1640 media/10% fetal bovine serum. Centrifuge cells at 500 x g for 5 min, remove supernatant, and wash 3x in 0.5 mL ice-cold PBS.\nFix cells in 0.5 mL PBS containing 1% paraformaldehyde and 1% sucrose on ice for 30 min. Wash cells 3x in 0.5 mL ice-cold PBS and centrifuge at 250 x g for 5 min. Permeabilize cells in 0.5 mL PBS containing 0.15% Triton X-100 for 5 min on ice. Wash cells in ice-cold PBS and repeat centrifugation.\nSuspend cells in 0.1 mL PBS containing 2 μg/mL (or the manufacturer recommended concentration) of an anti-murine (isotype specific) Fc secondary polyclonal antibody conjugated to AlexaFluor 647 for 1 h at room temperature in the dark.\nCentrifuge at 250 x g for 5 min and wash cells 3x in 0.5 mL ice-cold PBS. Suspend cells in 0.5 mL PBS.\n\t\tPAUSE: Cells can be stored in refrigerator.\n\t\tNOTE: It is essential to select a secondary antibody that recognizes the correct isotype of the mAb of interest. AF647 is selected because of its far-infrared emission, which does not interfere with propidium iodide (PI) staining of the nucleus.",
    "Add PI to a concentration of 10 μg/mL to the container with cells. Next, mount 1 x 105 cells onto glass slides using mounting media and cover with a glass coverslip.\nExamine cells with a Plan Apo 60X oil immersion objective NA 1.42 on an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope. Detect PI fluorescence using the 488 nm argon laser and the spectral scanning prism set for 600 - 650 nm. For AF647 fluorescence use the 633 nm helium-neon laser and the spectral scanning prism set for 650 - 700 nm. Collect fluorescence emissions from PI and AF647 sequentially.\n\tNOTE: Use the same setting throughout the evaluation and comparison of the cells. However, you will have to adjust settings for trypsinized cells compared to non-trypsinized cells.\nUse microscope software to acquire images. Collect images using serial horizontal optical sections of 1,024 x 1,024 pixels with 2X line averaging taken at 0.5 μm intervals through the entire cell thickness. Present the images as stacked z-projections from four consecutive slices at the maximum fluorescence intensity.\nAnalyze cells with microscope software. Record the cellular distribution pattern of the conjugates. Specifically, evaluate whether intracellular fluorescence in the cytoplasm is grouped and near the cell surface or diffuse and homogeneous. Also evaluate the relative fluorescence intensity per cell.\n3. Radiolabeled AC Construction and Cellular Fractionation for the Evaluation of 64 Cu Intracellular Delivery Efficiency\nCAUTION: Procedures 3 and 4 involve the handling and manipulation of radioactivity. Before performing these steps, researchers should have approved safety training and protocols approved from their home institution's radiation safety authority.",
    "NOTE: For Procedures 3 and 4 we use the mAb A14, which is specific for the invasive bladder cancer antigen IL-5Rα41. Also, all experiments are time sensitive due to the short half-life of 64Cu. In general, it is best to not wait past 1 week to perform in vitro experiments and no longer than 72 h for in vivo studies.\nIn a 1.7 mL tube suspend 2,2'-(7-(2-((2,5-dioxopyrrolidin-1-yl)oxy)-2-oxoethyl)-1,4,7-triazonane-1,4-diyl)diacetic acid (NOTA-NHS) in DMSO to a concentration of 10 mM.\nReact 50-fold molar excess of NOTA-NHS with A14 (2 mg starting material) in 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate at pH 8.6 for 1 h at room temperature in a volume ≤ 0.5 mL (the final NOTA-NHS volume should not exceed 2% v/v of total volume).\nPurify and buffer-exchange NOTA-A14 using an ultrafiltration device in PBS, pH 7.6 (see step 1.4).\nFor subsequent attachment of ChAcNLS, follow steps 1.2-1.6.\nReact NOTA-A14-ChAcNLS (250 μg batches) with 100 megabecquerel (MBq) of 64CuCl2 in 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate, pH 5.5 for 1 h at 37 °C ≤ 0.1 mL. 64Cu is produced on the TR-PET cyclotron at the CIMS 42.\nConcentrate 64Cu-A14-ChAcNLS in PBS pH 7.4 using an ultrafiltration device to the desired concentration (see step 1.4).\nDetermine the radiolabeling efficiency of 64Cu-A14-ChAcNLS by instant thin-layer chromatography (ITLC) using chromatography strips and 0.1 M, pH 5.5 sodium citrate (ITLC eluent) as solvent. Apply 0.5 μL aliquot of the reaction solution to the ITLC strip. Perform an autoradiograph of the strip and obtain a digital image.\nPerform densitometry to obtain the proportion of bound and free 64Cu. If free 64Cu content is > 5%, return to previous step and perform additional purification.",
    "In addition, perform SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining to evaluate aggregations. Perform a second SDS-PAGE followed by an autoradiograph of the gel to determine if there are radiolabeled aggregate species.\nAffinity binding quality check point: Incubate 64Cu-A14 conjugates at increasing concentrations (0-100 nM) in duplicate with 1 x 106 target cells per mL. To estimate nonspecific binding, mix duplicate samples of 64Cu-A14 conjugates with cells in the presence of 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled A14.\nAfter 1 h incubation on ice, wash cells and count total bound antibody samples and total nonspecific bound antibody samples in a gamma counter. Graph specific binding (total bound antibody - nonspecific bound antibody) against reactive free 64Cu-A14 (nM) used in the assay. Determine the dissociation constant (Kd) by nonlinear regression using graphing software.\nFor 64Cu cellular accumulation studies: Treat cells with 100 nM of the 64Cu-labeled A14 conjugates for 1 h, 6 h, and 24 h at 37 °C as previously described33. Include additional parameters such as treatment in the presence of unmodified A14 to block IL-5Rα sites and at 4 °C to block receptor-mediated internalization.\nAt the defined time points, as previously described in step 2.3 - 2.3.2, add 0.5 mL of PBS containing 0.25% trypsin and EDTA at 37 °C followed by neutralization and washing.\nIncubate cells in plasma membrane lysis buffer containing 1% NP-40, 10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2 buffer on ice for 10 min. Centrifuge the plasma membrane-lysed cells at 90 x g for 5 min.\nRemove supernatant and place in fresh tube. This represents cytoplasmic fraction. Wash nuclei 3x in ice-cold PBS and add washes to the cytoplasmic fraction.",
    "Ensure vials containing the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions are sealed. Then place them in a gamma counter calibrated for 64Cu in order to convert raw counts to MBq.\nDetermine the quality of nuclei isolation by performing Western blot analysis for Lamin A/C, a restricted nuclear protein, and Rab7, an abundant cytoplasmic protein on whole cell lysate, nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions.\nTreat 5 x 106 cells with 500 μL of radio-immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer and the plasma membrane lysis buffer in step 3.12 containing 1%, 2%, and 4% NP-40. Furthermore, treat the isolated nuclei in 500 μL of RIPA buffer to obtain isolated nuclear proteins.\nPrecipitate isolated nuclear, cytoplasmic and whole cell proteins using 4x the sample volume of cold acetone for 60 min at -20 °C. Centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 10 min and decant supernatant being careful not to dislodge the protein pellet. Add 100 μL of PBS to dissolve proteins.\nLoad 10 μg of protein into each well of a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Perform electrophoresis as described in 1.7-1.9. Perform Western Blot transfer as previously described in refeference 43.\nIdentify the ladder markers that best correspond to a MW of ~40 kDa. Cut the membrane in half at this marker. Probe the blot containing the higher MW proteins with Lamin A/C-specific antibodies. Probe the membrane with the lower MW proteins with the Rab 7-specific antibodies. Western blot is a well known technique and not described in this protocol.\n4. PET Imaging Evaluation of Tumor Targeting",
    "NOTE: The techniques of implanting tumor cells in mice to generate heterotopic xenografts are well known and most laboratories have in-house protocols tailored for their tumor system. Thus, this is not covered in the protocol. The xenograft model will be nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice bearing IL-5Rα-positive invasive bladder tumors HT-1376 and HT-B9. IL-5Rα-positive invasive bladder tumor cells comprise > 66% of total cells in the xenograft. In contrast, only ~11% of IL-5Rα-positive HT-B9 cells were contained in developed xenografts41. Thus this model provides an excellent example for evaluating AC tumor targeting in two tumors that represent foreseeable patient tumor heterogeneity.\nIn groups containing ≥ 4 (NOD/SCID) mice, inject 20-30 μg (6-9 MBq) of 64Cu-A14-ChAcNLS, 64Cu-A14-NLS, and 64Cu-A14 into the tail vein.\nOn the same day place a cylindrical phantom (24.8 mL) containing 5 MBq of 64Cu to convert the radioactive counts per second into injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g).\nWait 48 h and then anesthetize mice by placing them in an induction chamber with 1.5 L/min of oxygen flow with 2% isoflurane. Apply sterile ophthalmic ointment to mouse eyes after induction and before placement into PET scanner.\nRapidly transfer the mouse to a PET scanner table in the headfirst prone position with a nose cone for isoflurane. Position the respiration and rectal probes and monitor temperature and respiration rate to ensure that physiological conditions are maintained during the experiment as previously described 44.\nStart the PET data acquisition using a regular sampling mode setting and an energy window of 250 - 650 keV. Typically, a 45-minute static scan per mouse is sufficient to provide sufficient coincident events for reconstruction and production of high quality PET images.",
    "After the 64Cu-AC scan, remove mouse from the scanner and place it back in the cage. Allow for the mouse to sufficiently recover before returning to the animal facility.\nObtain reconstructed images using 20 iterations of a three-dimensional Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization algorithm.\nPerform region of interest (ROI) analysis of the tumor and visually assessable organs using the AMIDE software.\nDraw ROIs to obtain quantitative %ID/g data by manually using the 3D Freehand tool setting and carefully delineate the tumors or the adjacent thigh muscle. The counts per pixel in the ROI will be converted to %ID/g from previous step 4.2.\nCompare 64Cu-A14, 64Cu-A14-ChAcNLS, 64Cu-A14-NLS images for tumor contrast, and quantitative ROI %ID/g, and tumor-to-background ratios.\nSubscription Required.
