    "The animals presented here were maintained and handled in compliance with the institutional guidelines. All animal procedures were approved by the Michigan State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) in compliance with federal and state regulations.\n1. Drug-free confirmation of 6-OHDA lesion status\nPostural Tail hang test11,12,13\n\tNOTE: Assess lesion status at least 1 week following 6-OHDA lesion induction (See9,10,35 for details on lesioning) in experimental subjects (e.g., male or female, adult Sprague Dawley or Fisher 344 rats). \n\t\nSuspend the rat approximately 6 cm above its cage, firmly holding at the base of the tail, for ~5 s.\nRecord the direction of body contortion as + for a successfully lesioned animal twisting contralateral to the lesioned side and - for lack of twisting or twisting in both directions.\nNOTE: These tests are optional but recommended. See14,15,16,17 for additional drug-free testing options/variations.\nStep adjusting drag test (adapted from16)\n\tNOTE: Assess lesion status at least 1 week following unilateral 6-OHDA lesion induction in experimental subjects (e.g., male or female, adult Sprague Dawley or Fisher 344 rats).\n\t\nHold the rat by the base of its tail, elevating the back feet off the surface by ~6 cm; drag backward across a flat, smooth but not slippery surface, ~75 cm, over 5–10 s.\nObserve and record the number of tapping/step adjusting movements of each forepaw over three repeated tests.\nScore the subject as + for successful unilateral lesioning when 0–2 forepaw taps are observed contralateral to the lesioned side, together with rapid tapping (~10 taps) from the forepaw ipsilateral to the lesioned side (e.g., animals unilaterally lesioned on the left side show tapping deficit (0–2 taps) with the contralateral right forepaw).\nConversely, score moderate to rapid tapping (5–10 taps) from both forepaws as - to indicate incomplete or unknown lesion status.",
    "NOTE: An anxious animal can show rapid tapping/step adjusting even if successfully lesioned. If this is suspected, place the rat back in their home cage and re-test ≥30 mins later.\n2. Preparation of reagents and supplies\nDetermine L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride (levodopa or L-DOPA) and benserazide hydrochloride, a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor (see Table of Materials) dose, rating frequency, and experimental timeline that is appropriate for the investigational question12,18,19,20 (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: Investigational questions can be posed to seek any number of questions ranging from asking whether a specific therapy might reduce existing LID or prevent induction of LID. They can also explore whether therapeutic efficacy is dependent on the dose of levodopa or whether LID expression and/or therapeutic efficacy varies depending on the sex, species, and age of the subject.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62970/62970fig1v3.jpg\nFigure 1: Example of treatment timeline. Example L-DOPA dose-escalation timeline of 12 weeks in total length, with 8 weeks of L-DOPA injections beginning 3 weeks after 6-OHDA lesioning and 4 weeks following experimental treatment. In this example, L-DOPA is subcutaneously injected 5x per week (Monday–Friday) at approximately the same time each day, for 2 weeks at each prescribed L-DOPA dose (3, 6, 9, and 12 mg/kg). Behavioral LID ratings take place on days 1, 6, and 10 of each L-DOPA dosage level.

    "Calculate the amount of L-DOPA and benserazide required for each weekly concentration, weighing out lyophilized aliquots for each day of injection, and storing in combination for 1–2 weeks at -20 °C in glass amber vials until the day of treatment.\n\tNOTE: Target dose is 12 mg/kg or 12 mg L-DOPA/1000 g body weight. Example of calculations for determining the amount of L-DOPA and saline needed for each day of a week using 12 mg L-DOPA/kg body weight at an injection volume of 1 cc/kg of rat weight is given in Supplementary File 1.\n3. Room and cage set up\nOn the first day of L-DOPA treatment 3-4 weeks following 6-OHDA lesion surgery, transfer rats to single housing, including IACUC-approved enrichment.\nMaintain in single housing throughout the study to avoid peer interference with behavioral assessments.\nOn LID rating days, place the home cages on a steel wire rack, turned at an approximately 45° angle for optimal viewing of the rat (Figure 2A). Flip the identification tags (Figure 2B) upward and remove water bottles, food racks, and all types of enrichment in the cage (Figure 2C) to avoid interference with behavioral assessments.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62970/62970fig02.jpg",
    "Figure 2: Example of the cage set up for LID ratings of large-scale rat experiments. (A) Multiple cages can be set up for LID rating using large metal racks that allow for optimal viewing of each animal. Cages should be spread apart at a 45° angle with ID cards flipped upward (B), food, water bottles, nesting materials, and other enrichment removed to limit visual obscureness of the rat and distractions to the rat while examining dyskinetic behaviors (C). The metal racks need to be a few feet away from any wall to allow the rater to examine the rat at the front or back of the cage as needed. It is essential to label enrichment apparatuses (e.g., C- red rat retreat houses) with individual animal IDs to replace them into the same cage from which they came. This is particularly important when using animals of different sexes not to increase stress to the experimental subjects.

Levodopa injections and dyskinesia rating\nSubcutaneous injections of L-DOPA21,22\nImmediately preceding the daily injection of L-DOPA, add the appropriate volume of sterile saline to the pre-weighed lyophilized L-DOPA and benserazide mix in the amber vial and shake well for 10 s (step 2.3).\n\t\tNOTE: Target injection volume is 1 mL/1000 g body weight (with 12 mg L-DOPA per mL). The volume of the sterile saline will depend on the number of animals per study.\nFill individual syringes (e.g., 1.0 or 0.5 mL with 26 G needle) with the required volume for each animal (1 mL/kg rat weight) and label each syringe with individual animal identification.",
    "NOTE: Keep the filled syringes protected from light in sterile pouches until the time of injection. L-DOPA rapidly oxidizes in the presence of oxygen and light in an aqueous environment23,24,25,26.\nBring the first cage to the injection bench.\nRemove the rat from its cage and place it on the injection surface.\nGently restrain the head and shoulders against the surface on which the rat is resting with the palm of the non-dominant hand.\nGently, scruff the skin on the back overlying the scapulae with the thumb and forefinger of the non-dominant hand, inject L-DOPA volume with the dominant hand into the subcutaneous space between/below the fingers, keeping the needle as parallel to the body as possible to avoid intramuscular injection.\n\t\t​NOTE: The rats are not anesthetized before injection.\nDispose of each used individual syringe in a sharp's container.\nReplace the rat into its individual cage and add nutritionally complete treats except on LID rating days to avoid interference with behavioral assessments until after ratings are complete.\nSet the timer for 1–2 min depending on the rating time desired and the number of rats in the study on rating days. Retrieve the next cage and inject the next rat when the timer indicates.\nRepeat this, injecting one rat every 1–2 min, until all the rats are injected.\nLevodopa-induced dyskinesia rating post-injection\n\t\nRate the intensity (Table 1) and frequency (Table 2) of dystonic and hyperkinetic dyskinesia movements at the desired number of timepoints, which should include the initial onset of LID behavior, peak behavior, and the phase of decline (see Supplementary File 2 for an example of LID rating log sheet).",
    "For male and female adult Sprague Dawley or Fisher 344 rats, and a sample size of N = 40 rats, begin the dyskinesia ratings 20 min after the first L-DOPA injection, and then at 50 min intervals until 220 or 270 min post-injection, depending on when LID behaviors have discontinued in 90%–100% of rats.\nIf using 1 min rating intervals, set a timer for 1 min. Rate the first rat for one minute. Move to the next rat and rate it for 1 min. Continue through all the rats, rating for 1 min intervals.\nHave a timer positioned next to the cage visibly so that the LID behavior intensity (Table 1) can be observed while estimating the frequency of any given behavior (Table 2) during the rating period.\nAfter ratings for the first time point are completed start again with the first rat at the next time point (e.g; 70 min post-injection) and continue at the desired interval (e.g., every 50 min) until all time points are completed.\n\t\tNOTE: Due to the overlap of L-DOPA injection and LID rating tasks, two persons are needed on the rating days, one for injecting and one for behavioral ratings.\nSubscription Required.
