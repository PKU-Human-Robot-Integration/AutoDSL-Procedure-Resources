    "1. Establishment of the 3D Cell Culture Insert System\nPlace 2 polycarbonate cell culture inserts in an inverted orientation (filter side up) down in a 6 well plate (Figure 1A).\nApply a thin layer of 0.1% gelatin in water to the bottom side of the insert and allow to dry (10-20 min) in a biological safety cabinet to maintain sterility.\nRepeat step 1.2 two more times for a total of 3 applications of 0.1% gelatin on the inserts.\n\tNOTE: The gelatin coating will help limit diffusion between the chambers.\nTo collect the primary CRCs from standard culture conditions, add 5 mL of PBS to wash the culture flask.\n\t\nTrypsinize the cells using (1 mL for a T-25 and 2 mL for a T-75) 0.25% trypsin-EDTA for 5 min at 37 °C. Gently tap the side of the flask to aid in dislodging the cells. Then proceed to stop the trypsin reaction and collect the cells by adding 5 mL of complete DMEM.\nCollect the cells in a 15 mL tube. Centrifuge the tube at 4 °C and 188 x g and count using an automated cell counter or a hemocytometer.\nRe-suspend 600,000 CRCs in 250 μL conditioned media (CM) and add to the properly oriented (filter side down) culture insert (Figure 1B). This is referred to as the inner chamber.\n\t\tNote: CM is F-media conditioned by irradiated J2 cells and contains 10 μm Y-27632 as previously described7,8,9,11.\nApply 2 mL of CM to the outer chamber of the 6 well plate and incubate at 37 °C overnight (for at least 18 h).",
    "Carefully remove the CM on the inner chamber with a 1 mL or 200 μL pipette and slowly add differentiation media (DM) to the inner chamber with a 1 mL pipette until full. Be careful to not disturb the cell layer.\n2. Maintenance of 3D Cultures\nCheck the cultures every day. Healthy cells appear as shown in Figure 2.\nChange the CM in the outer chamber every day or every other day depending on the metabolism of the cells.\nWhen the media of the inner chamber changes color (yellow), carefully remove the media on the inner filter chamber with a 1 mL or 200 μL pipette.\nAspirate the media in the outer 6 well plate chamber with an aspirating tip.\nUsing a 1 mL pipette, slowly apply fresh DM to the inner chamber until full. Be careful not to scrape or otherwise dislodge the cell layer.\nReplace the media in the outer chamber with 2 mL of fresh CM.\nMaintain the cultures for 2 weeks, and then proceed to processing for the desired bimolecular isolation.\n\tNOTE: Each row in the 6 well plate, a total of six inserts (Figure 1B), should be processed per experiment to acquire enough cells for DNA, RNA or protein for analysis.\nAspirate media in the outer chamber and rinse with 2 mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\nCarefully remove media from the inner chamber with a 1 mL or 200 μL pipette and add 500 μL PBS. Avoid scraping or otherwise disturbing the cells on the membrane.",
    "Aspirate PBS from the outer chamber and carefully remove PBS from the inner chamber with a 1 mL or 200 μL pipette. Once the PBS has been removed, proceed directly to the appropriate application detailed below. Do not allow the membrane to dry out. The culture can be kept briefly in the PBS until the application is ready to begin.\n3. Processing the Filters for Pellet Banking\nAdd 100 μL  0.25% trypsin-EDTA to each inner chamber and incubate for 5 min at 37 °C.\nBriefly and carefully agitate/scrape the cells on the membrane surface with a 200 μL pipette while pipetting up and down (avoid puncturing the membrane). Incubate for 1 min at 37 °C.\nAdd 250 μL of CM to the first inner chamber and pipette up and down gently to rinse the filter.\nTransfer resuspended cells to the adjacent filter chamber that contains the same media conditions and repeat pipetting up and down.\nRepeat this procedure for each of the inserts of a single condition. Collect and transfer cells to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.\nRinse each inner chamber with an additional 100-200 μL of CM to collect any remaining cells. Add to the 1.5 mL centrifuge tube in step 3.5.\nSpin the cells at 423 x g in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and wash the cell pellet once with 1000 μL PBS.\nSpin again at 423 x g in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 5 min.\nAspirate PBS and freeze at -80 °C for later use.\n4. Processing the Filters for RNA or DNA Isolation\nAdd 200 μL of guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform or similar extraction reagent to the inner chamber and briefly agitate the cells on the membrane surface by pipetting up and down.",
    "Incubate in the extraction reagent for 5 min at room temperature with the outer chamber dry.\nAs the filter may dissociate from the insert, wash the disassociated filter membrane by pipetting the extraction solution up and down. Collect as much of the extraction reagent as possible by tilting the 6 well plate and aspirating any residual liquid.\nFollow the manufacturer's protocol for purification and recovery of DNA, RNA or protein.\n5. Processing the Filters for Protein Isolation\nPlace the filter insert in the 6 well plate on ice. To the inner chamber, add 10 μL of protein lysis buffer supplemented with 1 mM sodium fluoride (NaF), 1 mM sodium vanadate (NaV), 100 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 100 μL of anti-protease cocktail.\nAgitate/scrape the cells on the membrane surface with a 20 μL pipette while pipetting up and down. Avoid generating bubbles in the lysis buffer.\nIncubate the 6 well plate with filter inserts on ice for 10 min.\nRepeat scraping and then rinse the membrane surface with the lysis buffer.\nCollect the lysates from the 6 inserts and transfer to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube on ice.\nRinse the first membrane with an additional 10 μL of lysis buffer and transfer to the next filter.\nRepeat step 5.6 for all inserts, collecting any residual lysis buffer solution and add to the 1.5 mL tube (step 5.5).\nIncubate the sample on ice for an additional 5 min.\nSpin at maximum speed (16,873 x g in a table top centrifuge) for 15 min at 4 °C.\nPipette lysate supernatant into a fresh 1.5 mL tube.\nProceed to the analysis of protein concentration or store lysates at -80 °C.\n6. Processing for H&E and Immuno-staining",
    "Add 500 µL and 1 mL of 10% NBF (neutral buffered formalin) to the inner and outer chamber and let incubate overnight at 4 °C.\nAspirate the NBF from the outer chamber and add 1 mL hydroxyethyl agarose (HEA) processing gel to a 1.5 mL centrifuge. Slowly melt the agarose in a microwave using low power and repeated 10-20 s pulses until the agarose is melted.\nKeep the HEA in a 37 °C warm bath to prevent solidification until ready to use.\nRemove the NBF from the inner chamber and apply 25 μL of molten HEA to the inner chamber and allow the agarose to solidify for 2-5 min.\nWet 2 foam histology pads in 10% NBF and place one pad in an embedding cassette (see Figure 3D).\nUse a #11 blade scalpel (which has a very sharp, fine-pointed blade) to score the filter from the bottom side of the insert chamber, partially releasing it from the plastic insert chamber.\nPlace a small amount (100-200 μL) of NBF in a Petri dish and immerse the partially dislodged filter in the NBF (Figure 3A).\nWith a #10 blade scalpel, gently press against the middle of the filter, from the inside of the insert chamber, to fully dislodge the filter from the insert barrel (Figure 3B). If there is any part of the filter that is still attached to the barrel, sever it with the scalpel.\nCut the HEA-coated filter in half with the #10 blade scalpel (Figure 3C).\nPlace each half of the filter onto the foam pad in the histology cassette prepared in step 6.4 (Figure 3D).\nAdd the second 10% NBF soaked sponge to the cassette, sandwiching the filter.\nSnap seal the cassette, place in NBF, and incubate overnight.",
