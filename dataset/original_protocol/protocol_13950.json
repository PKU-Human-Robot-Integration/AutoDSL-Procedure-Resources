The taillights of the front vehicle will light up as per real-world driving to indicate a brake event.",
    "Provide participants with a 5 min practice trial to learn to maintain a two-second headway distance behind the front vehicle. The practice trial includes a set of 5 random brakes.\n\t\nDuring the practice trial, if the participants are less than 1.5 s behind the front vehicle, the driving simulation software will play a prompt with a female voice \"too close, please slow down\".\nIf the participants are between 2.25 to 2.5 s behind the front vehicle, the driving simulation software will play a prompt with a female voice \"too far, please speed up\".\nDo not include data from the practice trial for the analysis.\nLet the participants know that the study can be stopped without any penalty by notifying the experimenters at any time, if necessary.\nBegin the formal experiment once the participants have completed the practice session and can maintain a stable following distance.\nStart the formal experimental session, which consists of a total of four blocks (i.e., finger, wrist, temple, and driving-only) with 13 random braking events in each block, resulting in a total of 52 experimental trials. The order of conditions is counterbalanced with the Latin square design. No voice prompt is provided in the formal trials.\nAssist the participants to put on the vibrating toolkit using medical tape before each block of trials according to the conditions assigned. The vibrating toolkit (if worn) warns the participants to brake when the front vehicle is braking. The taillights of the front vehicle are illuminated every time the front vehicle brakes.\nEnsure that the participants are given a 2 min rest upon completion of each block to reduce carryover effects.",
    "Ask the participants for their preferred location for the vibrating toolkit and the perceived vibration intensity with a 7-point Likert scale upon completion of all trials. The usage rate of each daily wearable accessories (i.e., watch, glasses, earphones, and ring) is also recorded. In the preference scale for the location of the vibrating toolkit, \"1\" represents \"least favorite\" and \"7\" represents \"most favorite\", while in the vibration intensity scale \"1\" represents \"weak feeling\" and \"7\" represents \"strong feeling\".\n6. Data analysis\nCollect the driving behavior data of the participants at 50 Hz using the driving simulation software, including the brake response time, vehicle speed, steering wheel reversal rate, lane position (SDLP), and headway distance, etc.\nPerform data analysis of the drivers' performance.\n\t\nConduct an outlier analysis using the normal distribution with cut-off as three standard deviations from the mean to determine what data to be included for further analysis.\nCalculate the brake response time by subtracting the time when the participant vehicle brakes (i.e., a minimum reduction of 1% of the brake pedal36,42) from the time when the front vehicle starts to brake.\nLabel the data as “no brake response” if the brake response time is larger than or equal to 5 s (i.e., a failure to brake within 5 s after the front vehicle brakes).\nDivide the number of successful brakes by the total number of brakes performed by the front vehicle to calculate the brake response rate.\nAverage all the values of each participant to obtain the mean brake response rate and brake response time of each condition and compute the standard deviation on those values for further analyses.\nSubscription Required.
