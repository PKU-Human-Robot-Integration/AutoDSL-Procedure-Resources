    "1. Microfabrication of a Gut-on-a-chip Device\nNote: The gut-on-a-chip is a microfluidic device made by transparent, gas-permeable silicone polymer (polydimethylsiloxane, PDMS), containing two parallel microchannels (1 mm width x 150 µm height x 1 cm length) separated by a flexible porous (10 µm in pore diameter, 25 µm in spacing pore to pore) PDMS membrane5,9. Fabricate the gut-on-a-chip (Figure 1A, left) following the steps provided.\nMicrofabrication Procedure of the Gut-on-a-chip5,9.\n\t\nPrepare uncured, degassed PDMS by mixing the PDMS prepolymer and the curing agent (15:1 w/w), and place it in the vacuum desiccator for 30 min.\nPour 30 g and 3 g of uncured, degassed PDMS onto each silicon mold that has SU-8 based micropatterns of the upper and the lower microchannels of the gut-on-a-chip, respectively. Then cure at 60 °C in a dry oven for at least 4 hr.\nDemold the upper and lower PDMS layers from each silicon mold by cutting around the edge using a surgical scalpel. Punch 6 holes (two inlets, two outlets, and two vacuum chambers) using a biopsy puncher (2.0 mm in hole diameter).\nPrepare the porous membrane by pouring 10 g of uncured and degassed PDMS on a silanized silicon wafer containing post arrays with circular pillars (10 µm in diameter, 25 µm in height) overlaying with a flat, silanized PDMS support layer (15:1, w/w; 1 cm thick). Place a 3 kg weight presser on the setup and cure the polymer at 60 °C for 12 hr or longer.\nDemold the setup of a porous PDMS membrane adhered to the PDMS support slab from the silicon wafer by carefully lifting up the corner of the slab from the wafer, and peeling off until the porous PDMS membrane is completely detached from the wafer.",
    "Expose the channel side of an upper layer (PDMS, 15:1, w/w) and the porous membrane side to the plasma generated by a handheld corona treater for 1 min, and 3 sec, respectively.\nPlace the plasma-treated surfaces of the porous PDMS membrane and upper microchannel layer in a conformal contact by placing each piece in parallel without any air bubbles.\nIncubate the whole setup at 80 °C O/N for irreversible bonding of the two PDMS layers.\nPeel off the PDMS support layer from the assembly of an upper layer with a porous membrane by carefully lifting up the corner of the support layer, and peeling off until the support layer is completely detached from the upper layer with the membrane.\nTear off the portions of this membrane located over the vacuum chambers (the two chambers located on either side of the main channel) using a fine-tip tweezers to make hollow vacuum chambers.\nExpose the side with the membrane attached on the top piece and the side with the channels engraved on the lower piece to plasma in a same way as described in step 1.1.6 for 1 min.\nAlign the upper microchannel layer with a porous membrane and the lower layer with a conformal contact by placing each piece in parallel without any air bubbles under a stereoscope.\nCure the whole setup in a dry oven at 80 °C O/N to produce a complete scale gut-on-a-chip microfluidic device containing two hollow vacuum chambers next to the microfluidic cell channel.\nConnect tubing to the inlet and outlet of each port linked to the upper or the lower microchannels in a gut-on-a-chip via a 90° bent stainless steel blunt-end needle.\nConnect the tubing to the holes linked to the vacuum chambers using a 90° bent stainless steel blunt-end needle.",
