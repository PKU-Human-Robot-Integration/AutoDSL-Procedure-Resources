    "This protocol describes the careful dissociation and cryopreservation of hPSC-CMs (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-fig-0002]). There are several critical aspects to preserving the viability of hPSC-CMs during this process. The first is effective dissociation without degradation of the cells. This presents a challenge as often differentiating hPSC-CM monolayer cultures have a high cell density (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-fig-0003]), and tend to increase the amount of extra cellular matrix proteins they secrete and cell-cell junctions they generate, which all need to be digested. The most often cited approach uses fast but powerful enzymatic dissociation, which is what is described here. An alternative is more slow but gentle dissociation, requiring different reagents and protocol (see Background Information). The next important aspect is gentle handling of the cells. Slow regular trituration generating a minimal amount of effervescence and sheer stress is strongly advised. Finally, slow but steady cooling of −1°C/min and protection against intracellular ice formation via a cryoprotective agent (CPA) is important for all conventional cell cryopreservation. Here this is handled via proprietary Mr. Frosty™ cryopreservation boxes; however, other products and even controlled rate freezing machines such as ViaFreeze™ should work well. The impact of different cryopreservation media is discussed in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-prot-0002] and Understanding Results.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/bf250a8a-9c23-4861-9de7-5f1fa194b91d/cpsc125-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nSchematic of hPSC-CM dissociation and freezing (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-prot-0001]). 1. Dissociate hPSC-CMs by incubating with 10× TrypLE and gently pipetting; 2. Transfer hPSC-CMs to CM Suspension medium and centrifuge; 3. Resuspend hPSC-CMs, count and centrifuge again; 4. Resuspend hPSC-CMs in CM Freezing medium; 5. Transfer 0.5-1 ml cell suspension/cryovial, add to cooled cryostorage boxes and place overnight at −80°C before transferring to liquid N2.

    "Effects of dissociation and cryopreservation time points on hPSC-CMs. (A) Phase-contrast microscopy of hPSC-CM monolayers at day 14 or 21 of differentiation prior to initial dissociation. Bar = 100 µm. (B) Viability staining with trypan blue following initial dissociation of hPSC-CMs at different time points during differentiation. Points represent individual differentiation experiments from three different hPSC lines (represented by circles, triangles or squares), except for red, blue, and black, which are corresponding experiments dissociated at different time points. Regression analysis showed R2 = 0.45, with a coefficient y = −0.016× +107 (p = 0.048), indicating that around half the change in viability is due to day of dissociation. (C) Cell recovery following freezing and thawing of hPSC-CMs at different time points during differentiation. hPSC-CMs had been dissociated and re-plated at an earlier time point (∼days 12-16) and subsequently dissociated a second time before freezing at 3 × 106 cells/vial using CryoStor CS10. Mean recovery = 1.8 × 106 ±0.13 cells/vial ±SEM (60%), p = 0.22 (one-way ANOVA). (D) Representative flow cytometry plot and mean CM marker expression in dissociated fixed hPSC-CMs at day 13-15 of differentiation.

Dissociation of the two individual plates is slightly staggered to reduce disparity in 10× TrypLE incubation times.\n1. Ensure a sufficient amount of the following reagents and equipment are pre-cooled by placing them for 30 to 60 min at 4°C before starting (if not already stored there): cryostorage boxes, CM Freezing medium.\n2. Ensure a sufficient amount of the following reagents are brought to room temperature for 30-60 min before starting: CM Suspension medium, 10× TrypLE, PBS-.\n3. Aspirate culture medium from hPSC-CMs, wash wells once with 1.5 ml PBS- each, and aspirate.\n4. Add 1 ml of 10× TrypLE to each well of the first culture plate of hPSC-CMs and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-fig-0002]_1).\nNOTE: If hPSC-CM cell density is significantly lower than that shown in Figure 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-fig-0003], 10× TrypLE can be slightly diluted to 5-8× using PBS-. See Troubleshooting.\n5. After 2 min, add 1 ml of 10× TrypLE to each well of the second culture plate and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2.",
    "NOTE: If a cell shaker is available in the incubator, place plates on this at a speed of 50-70 rpm, and reduce total incubation time by 1-2 min. See Troubleshooting.\n6. Prepare a 50-ml Falcon tube for collection of cells, with 1.5 ml CM Suspension medium added per well.\nNOTE: For 2 × 6-well plates, add 18 ml.\n7. After 6-7 min incubation, remove each plate from incubator to check under the microscope for cell rounding and loosening (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-fig-0002], lower panel).\n8. Replace cells in incubator and check again after 1-4 min, until almost the whole culture has rounded into individual cells and clusters, but with only a few free-floating cells or small cell clusters detached from the culture plate surface (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-fig-0002], lower panel).\nCRITICAL STEP: Judging the period of time for dissociation is a critical parameter. Different hPSC lines and differentiation protocols cause variability in the cell density and adherence; hence, total dissociation time will generally vary within the range of 8-12 min. See Troubleshooting.\n9. Remove cells from incubator and using a 1000-μl pipette, gently triturate cells in each well, tilting the plate towards you and pipetting around the far side of the well in a semi-circular motion 3-4 times, then tilting the plate away from you and pipetting around the near side of the well in a semi-circular motion 3-4 times (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-fig-0002], lower panel).\nCRITICAL STEP: Steady but gentle pipetting at this stage is crucial to dissociate the cells fully but avoid effervescence and shear stress leading to cell degradation and clumping later on. See Troubleshooting.\n10. Carefully transfer the TrypLE-cell suspension into the 50-ml collection Falcon containing CM Suspension medium.\nNOTE: Albumin and other factors in CM Suspension medium partially quench the protease activity of 10× TrypLE.",
    "11. Add an additional 1 ml fresh CM suspension medium to each well and using a 1000-μl pipette gently wash and elute final remaining cells, adding them to the 50-ml collection Falcon.\nCounting and Freezing\n12. Centrifuge the cells for 3 min at 200 × g, (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-fig-0002]_2).\nNOTE: We have found that lower centrifugation speeds usually pellet cells as effectively as higher speeds, and importantly help to reduce clumping of hPSC-CMs. If significant amounts of cells are still in suspension following centrifugation, perform a second centrifugation for 2-3 min at 300 × g.\n13. Aspirate the supernatant and very gently flick the bottom of the Falcon tube to help disperse the large cell pellet.\n14. Carefully add 1 ml fresh CM Suspension medium directly to the cells at the bottom of the tube using a 1000-μl pipette, and gently pipette up and down several times.\n15. Add an additional 9 ml CM Suspension medium to the cells using a stripette (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-fig-0002]_3).\nNOTE: This step is important as a wash step to remove excess protease, as well as cellular debris, which allows a more accurate viable cell count. If significant cell clumping has occurred, it can also be more easily identified at this stage. See Troubleshooting.\n16. Invert to mix, remove a 10-20-µl sample of cells and perform a viable cell count using Trypan Blue (Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-fig-0003]).\nNOTE: For Countess II, use default settings, and perform at least one and ideally two cell counts on each side of a counting chamber.\nNOTE: It is advisable to extract any cells required at this stage for re-plating fresh without cryopreservation, or sampling, e.g., for QC by flow cytometry (Fig. 3D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-fig-0003]).\n17. Centrifuge again for 3 min at 200 × g.",
    "18. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend hPSC-CMs in cooled CM Freezing medium to a density of 2-10 × 106 cells/ml, pipetting gently to mix (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-fig-0002]_4).\nNOTE: For discussion on cell freezing density see Background Information.\n19. Pipette 0.5-1 ml hPSC-CM cell suspension into cryovials and place in cooled cryostorage boxes (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-fig-0002]_5).\n20. Place cryostorage boxes at −80°C for at least 4 hr (generally overnight) before transferring cryovials to the vapor phase of liquid N2 for long-term storage.\nSample data\nFollowing cardiac differentiation of hPSCs (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-fig-0001]), we investigated the effect of dissociation and cryopreservation on hPSC-CMs. We found that the time point (differentiation day) for initial (first) dissociation may make a difference to the viability of the hPSC-CMs. In our hands, the viability of hPSC-CMs tends to decrease with a later time point for initial dissociation, day 14 tending to be better than day 21 (Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-fig-0003]), with a mean viability of 84% ±2.9 (SEM). Where possible we would therefore suggest an initial dissociation at an earlier time point i.e., around day 14 of differentiation (see Background Information and Understanding Results). However, dissociation and freezing of hPSC-CMs at later time points additionally to an initial dissociation at an earlier time point does not significantly affect the recovery of cells (Fig. 3C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-fig-0003]). As a general workflow, we would also recommend taking a sample of ∼1 × 106 cells for QC by flow cytometry following dissociation (Fig. 3D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-fig-0003]) (e.g., see Berg Luecke, Waas, & Gundry, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-bib-0002]). Together these data and simple protocol should facilitate the preparation and handling of hPSC-CMs for dissociation and cryopreservation at specified time points during differentiation.",
    "Similar to many other cell types, maintaining good recovery and viability of hPSC-CMs during thawing is dependent on a controlled but fast thaw and a gentle resuspension in culture medium (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-fig-0004]). For hPSC-CMs, slow dropwise resuspension using a relevant culture medium is particularly important for avoiding osmotic shock and maintaining viability (see Background Information).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7d22502a-8c72-43f6-bdcb-4d3b96b8da5a/cpsc125-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nSchematic of hPSC-CM thawing and re-plating (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-prot-0002]). 1. Quick thaw of hPSC-CMs in water bath; 2.Transfer thawed hPSC-CMs into 50-ml Falcon tube and slow dropwise addition of 1 ml CM Suspension medium, swirling in between; 3. Slow dropwise addition of 5 ml CM Suspension medium, swirling in between, and then transfer into 15-ml Falcon tube; 4. Centrifugation and resuspension in CM Suspension medium; 5. Cell count and adjustment of volume to desired cell density; 6. Addition to pre-coated culture plates and incubation.\nCryopreserved cells should be kept frozen until all downstream steps for thawing and recovery have been prepared first. Most importantly this includes coated cell culture plates for the downstream application of the cells. Differentiated hPSC-CMs can be re-plated at specified densities onto different types of cell culture plate (Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-tbl-0002]) coated with various forms of extra cellular matrix (ECM). Re-plating can be done either immediately following dissociation or after thawing from cryopreservation. In our hands, Geltrex is largely equivalent to Matrigel and works well for applications where a complete monolayer is desired, including on glass and plastic bottom plates, and those containing electrodes. Fibronectin is also widely used, especially where a lower density of cells on glass bottom plates is required, e.g., for patch clamping. Other ECMs such as Laminin-221/211 are known to work.\nTable 3.\n                Volumes of CM Suspension Medium Required for the Resuspension of hPSC-CMs Immediately After Thawinga[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-tbl3-note-0001_68]\ntable:",

Using dry ice or liquid nitrogen, collect cryovial(s) of cryopreserved hPSC-CMs from liquid N2 and bring to cell culture.\n4. Perform a quick thaw in a 37°C water bath. Occasionally gently swirl tubes in the bath, avoiding immersion above the level of the cap. Continue until about 90% defrosted (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-fig-0004]_1).\n5. Sterilize the tube exterior before taking into laminar flow hood e.g., by wiping with 70% ethanol solution.\n6. Using a 1000-μl pipette with 1000-μl pipette tip, remove cells from cryovial(s) and gently pipette into the bottom of a 50-ml conical Falcon tube.\nNOTE: Check the lids of cryovials as some models can retain large droplets of medium.\n7. Using a fresh 1-ml pipette, add 1 ml CM Suspension medium to the cryovial to recover any last microliters of leftover cells.\nNOTE: If defrosting 2× vials, pipette the same 1 ml of CM Suspension medium from one vial into the other.\n8. Using the same pipette tip, take up the 1 ml of CM Suspension medium now in the cryovial.\n9. Dropwise and slowly, add the recovered 1 ml of CM Suspension medium into the 50-ml Falcon tube, aiming for about 1-2 drops every 3-5 s, gently swirling between (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-fig-0004]_2).\nCRITICAL: Slow resuspension of hPSC-CMs is crucial to avoid osmotic shock.\nNOTE: If thawing 2× cryovials, repeat this dropwise addition of 1 ml medium to the Falcon again (Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-tbl-0003]).",

Perform a cell count including trypan blue live/dead staining using Countess II and counting slides, followed by an adjustment of the volume using CM Suspension medium + RevitaCell (1% v/v) to the desired cell density (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-fig-0004]_5).\n15.

N = 1× differentiation experiment with 3× vials per condition, error bars ±SD. (B) Phase-contrast microscopy of hPSC-CMs one or 5 days following thawing. Bar = 100 µm. (C) Representative flow cytometry plots and mean CM marker expression in dissociated fixed hPSC-CMs 7 days following thawing from different cryopreservation media. Negative control used was undifferentiated hPSCs. Differentiation experiments using two different lines BIHi005-A (striped) and BIHi050-A (block) are shown, N = 3× vials per line/condition, error bars ±SD. (D) Immunofluorescence microscopy of hPSC-CMs fixed and immunostained 5 days following thawing from different cryopreservation media. Blue nuclear counterstain was performed using DAPI. Bar = 100 µm. (E) Analysis of hPSC-CM field potential (FP) using Axion Biosystems MEA and CytoView 48-well plate 5 days following thawing from different cryopreservation media. After recording baseline spontaneous contraction, 1 µM isoprenaline or equivalent vehicle was added and contraction analyzed. Correction of FP duration was done using Fridericia's formula (cFPD). N = 1× cryovial across 4× wells per cryopreservation medium, subsequently divided into 2× wells each for vehicle or drug, error bars ±SD.\nSample data",
    "By following Basic Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-prot-0001] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-prot-0002] described here, a hPSC-CM recovery rate of between 50% and 70% can generally be expected (Fig. 3C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-fig-0003]; Fig. 5A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-fig-0005]). We investigated potential differences between certain cryopreservation media (Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-tbl-0001]). In our hands, different media appear to have only marginal effects on hPSC-CM viability and recovery. An exhaustive study would be required; however, in a limited study we find that viability and recovery upon thawing are comparable between four common freezing media (Fig. 5A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-fig-0005]), with a coupled spontaneously contracting monolayer exhibiting typical hPSC-CM morphology forming after 5 days (Fig. 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-fig-0005]), and similar levels of CM marker expression (Fig. 5C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-fig-0005]). We further investigated the three more chemically defined freezing media (Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-tbl-0001]) and found recovered hPSC-CMs to have a similar intracellular morphology and expression of cytoskeletal components and cardiac markers (Fig. 5D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-fig-0005]), as well as a comparable electrophysiological profile (Fig. 5E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.125#cpsc125-fig-0005]). These data show that the workflow outlined here in combination with potentially any of the four media tested can provide effective cryopreservation and functional recovery of hPSC-CMs. Please see Background Information and Understanding Results for further discussion."
