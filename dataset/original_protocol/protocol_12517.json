  "procedures": [
    "We used the strains w1118 (white) and w[*] Pink1[B9]/FM7i, P{w[+mC]=ActGFP}JMR3 (referred to as Pink1B9) (FlyBase ID: FBgn0029891) from the Bloomington Drosophila stock center (ID number: 34749). In this study, male D. melanogaster PINK1B9-null mutants are compared with male D. melanogaster from the w1118 strain, which is used as a control group (genetic background). Other parameters must be analyzed concomitantly with the respirometry experiments to ensure that the flies have the correct genotype (Pink1B9/Y), such as thorax deformities and locomotion problems, which are well described for pink1B9 mutant flies24,25,26.\n1. Animals and housing\nKeep the flies in glass bottles containing 10 mL of standard diet (yeast 1.73%, soy flour 0.9%, corn flour 7.3%, agar 0.5%, corn syrup 7.6%, and propionic acid 0.48%) at constant temperature and humidity (25 °C and 60%, respectively), with a 12 h:12 h light/dark cycle.\nFor each experiment, use two flies aged 1-3 days post-eclosion.\n\t​NOTE: The PINK1B9-null mutant virgin female flies were crossed with w1118 males to obtain the F1 males with genotype Pink1B9/Y.\n2. Sample preparation\nPrepare the MiR05 buffer as described in Table 1.\nAnesthetize the flies on ice and transfer them to microcentrifuge tubes (two flies per tube).\nIn each tube, add 200 µL of chilled MiR05 buffer and homogenize the flies. Homogenize manually, applying gentle pressure (approximately 4-6 strokes of the pestle) to prevent the disintegration of mitochondria.\n3. High-resolution respirometry calibration of polarographic oxygen sensors\nNOTE: The OROBOROS chambers have a total volume of approximately 2 mL. Calibration is required to ensure the oxygen flux is close to 0 pmol to start the assay.\nStarting the calibration, add 2 mL of MiR05 to the chamber. Cover the chamber with the stopper leaving no air bubbles; then, carefully pull the stopper to form one single air bubble.",
    "Open the OROBOROS Dat.Lab software. Enter a temperature of 25 °C in the Block temperature field and click on Connect to Oxygraph-2k (Figure 1A).\nClick and select the folder where the calibration is to be saved and click on Save.\nWhen a new window opens, name the experiment and the samples (if calibrating, simply enter the name calibration) and click on Save.\nGo to the Layout menu and choose the first option: 01 Calibration Exp. Gr.3 - Temp as shown in Figure 1B.\nWait for the program to redirect to the calibration layout, wait until the red line shows a standard straight line with points around 0 pmol. Then, select two points: one for chamber A and the other for chamber B (Figure 1C) when the red line is exactly at zero.\n\tNOTE: The selected points must have oxygen flux (red line) around 0.\n\t\nTo mark the points of both chambers, select O2 concentration on the right of the screen, select the marked point, and copy both the temperature and barometric pressure values relative to the point. Paste these values in the boxes below and click on Calibrate and Copy to Clipboard in the lower right corner of the screen as shown in Figure 2.\nCarry out this process for both chambers (A and B), then go to the File menu and select Save and Disconnect.\n\t\t​NOTE: After the calibration process, the program will redirect the user to the home screen so that the software will be ready to start the HRR test. For this test, we will use the SUIT protocol.\n4. SUIT protocol\nWith the calibration completed, remove the stoppers and open the chambers.",
    "Wash the stoppers (holding the tip that does not touch the sample) and chambers with 100% ethanol, 70% ethanol, and distilled water, in that order.\n\tNOTE: Repeat the process for every sample change.\nHomogenize the flies in 200 µL of buffer, place all sample content in the chamber using a micropipette, and relocate the stopper in the chamber, taking care to not create air bubbles.\n\tNOTE: If air bubbles form, remove the stopper gently and add 100 µL of MIR05 buffer.\nClick on the Layout menu and select the option 05 Flow by Corrected Volume as shown in Figure 1B.\nWait to be redirected to a new window. Click on Save to select the folder where the experiment is to be saved.\nWait for another new window to open. Name the experiment in the space Experimental Code. Then, name each sample in its respective chamber A and B in the Sample field, and set the field Unit to unit.\n\tNOTE: Other units can also be chosen, for example, Millions of cells or mg.\nConsidering that this protocol uses two flies (2 units) and the chamber volume is 2 mL, in the Concentration field, define 1 per mL (Figure 1D).\n\tNOTE: Here, the sample amount was normalized by the number of flies; however, this normalization may be performed by the protein content of the sample, mitochondrial DNA quantification, or activity of citrate synthase.\nWhen the oxygen flux signal (red line) is steady on the positive value, start the HRR protocol with the titration of substrates, inhibitors, and uncouplers (Figure 3). All the subsequent reagents and equipment are shown in Table 1.\n\t\nAdd digitonin (5 μg/mL) to permeabilize the mitochondrial membrane.",
    "Add pyruvate (5 mM), malate (2 mM), and proline (10 mM) substrates and wait until the oxygen flux increases and stabilizes. To mark the event for each reagent addition, press the F4 key on the keyboard and enter the name of each reagent.\nAdd ADP (5mM) to couple the mitochondrial respiratory chain and wait for the increase and stabilization of the oxygen flux.\nAdd succinate (10 mM) and wait for the increase and stabilization of the oxygen flux.\nAdd Oligomycin (2.5 µM) to inhibit ATP synthase and look for a decrease in oxygen flux.\nWait until the red line stabilizes and uncouple mitochondrial electron transfer using Carbonyl-4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone cyanide (FCCP) with titers of 0.25 µM until the maximum oxygen consumption is reached, demonstrated by the rise of the red line. After stabilization of the oxygen flux, start adding the inhibitors of each complex, one at a time.\nAdd Rotenone (0.5 µM), a complex I inhibitor. Wait for the decrease and stabilization of the oxygen flux to add the next inhibitor.\nAdd Malonate (5 mM), a complex II inhibitor. Wait for the decrease and stabilization of the oxygen flux to add the next inhibitor.\nFinally, add Antimycin (2.5 µM), a complex III inhibitor. Wait for the decrease followed by the increase and stabilization of the oxygen flux.\n\t\tNOTE: The oxygen flux should stabilize at a positive value but below the value for the last inhibition of mitochondrial protein complexes.\nAt the end of the analysis, remove all the content of the chambers using a micropipette. Store at -20 °C for future analysis, when necessary.\n5. Data analysis\nUtilize an appropriate statistical software package for data analysis.\nPerform t-tests to assess differences between the two groups. For situations involving multiple treatments, use Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) as a statistical test 27.",
    "Extract the O2 flux values from the graph generated by the software. OXPHOS CI refers to the value of O2 flux after adding ADP. OXPHOS CII is obtained by subtracting OXPHOS CI&CII - OXPHOS CI. OXPHOS CI&CII is the value of O2 flux extracted after the addition of succinate. ETS CI&CII is the O2 flux value after adding FCCP. ETS CI = FCCP - Rotenone and ETS CII = Rotenone - Malonate.\nCalculate ATP synthesis as the difference between the OXPHOS (P) and LEAK (L) (P - L)28.\nDetermine the Respiratory Control Ratio (RCR) by calculating the ratio OXPHOS/LEAK, where RCR = P/L.11\nSubscription Required.
