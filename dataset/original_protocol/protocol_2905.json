    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIn utero electroporation (optional)\nTiming: 1 h/mouse\nFor in vivo calcium imaging, genetically-encoded calcium indicator (GECI)-expressing pups are necessary. This section describes the steps to sparsely introduce calcium indicator protein GCaMP6s to cortical layer 4 neurons using the Supernova system2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] by in utero electroporation.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6],7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7],8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] This step can be skipped if appropriate GECI-expressing transgenic mice are available.\nPull glass capillary using a puller (PC-100, Narishige) to make micropipettes for plasmid solution injection. Cut the tip to a diameter of ∼50 μm using scissors.\nNote: Beveled micropipette tips (obtained by scraping the tips) are more favorable.\nWarm saline to 37°C in a 50 mL conical tube.\nAttach an injection micropipette to an aspirator tube (2-040-000, Drummond) and fill the micropipette with the plasmid solution (1 μL per pup).\nAnesthetize a pregnant mouse at embryonic day (E) 14 using a combination of sodium pentobarbital intraperitoneal injection (50 mg/kg body weight) and inhalation of isoflurane gas (0.8%–1.2% in air). Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nTurn on a timer to record the time taken for the operation. Finish the surgery within 30 min to reduce the physical strain of pregnant mouse and obtain more viable pups.\nSterilize the incision surface with 70% ethanol. Make a midline laparotomy, place saline-moistened non-woven fabric (e.g., Kimwipe) around the incision, and expose one side of the uterus to the fabric.\nNote: After exposing the uterus, dip warm saline constantly to prevent drying of the uterus. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nUsing a micropipette, inject DNA solution into one side of the lateral ventricle of each embryo. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: Change the micropipette when this becomes too blunt to penetrate the uterus wall.\nNote: Avoid injecting the embryo closest to the vagina. If the embryo stops developing and dies, other embryos often die sequentially.",
    "Pinch the embryo heads with a forceps-type electrode (CUY650P5, BEX) so that the target location is under the positive side of the electrode. Deliver square electric pulses (40 V, 50 ms) five times at 1 Hz using an electroporator (GEB14, BEX). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: Check the current amplitude shown on the electroporator. For our conditions, the amplitude is 50–80 mA.\nExpose the other side of the uterus, and reposition the electroporated side of the uterus. Repeat steps 7–8.\nPlace the exposed uterus back into the abdominal cavity. Fill the peritoneal cavity with warm saline and gently knead the stomach to relieve abdominal distension.\nSuture the abdominal wall. Before closing completely, inject warm saline into the peritoneal cavity again to prevent adhesions between the internal organs.\nSuture the abdominal skin.\nNote: The skin can also be closed with metal clips.\nAllow the mouse to recover on a heater (37°C). After recovery, return the mouse to the cage rack.\nCritical: To introduce genes in layer 5 or layer 2/3 neurons, in utero electroporation should be performed on E12–13 or E15, respectively. Electric pulse amplitude, duration, and numbers should also be altered.\nPup selection at postnatal days (P) 1–3 (optional)\nTiming: 15 min\nThis section describes steps to select electroporated pups with appropriate gene expression.\nPrepare a fluorescence stereo microscope.\nObserve pup heads and check whether a GCaMP signal is seen in the electroporated side of the cerebral hemisphere.\nEuthanize pups with no expression or inappropriate GCaMP expression.\nNote: Shorten the time when pups are away from their mother as much as possible.\nNote: Avoid selecting pups at the day of birth because the mother is nervous and would neglect the pups.",
    "Note: If the number of pups with appropriate expression exceeds eight, euthanize some so the final number is eight or less; otherwise, too many offspring hinder their growth.\nSkull exposure\nTiming: 15 min/pup\nThis section describes the steps to expose the skull of pups (P3–12) and to fix the cut surface of the scalp with tissue adhesive (Vetbond). Though the protocol of skull exposure and the following cranial window surgery section has been described previously,3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] we have included our modified protocol to provide additional advice.\nPrepare a fluorescence stereo microscope.\nPlace saline into a 50 mL conical tube and maintain it at 20°C–25°C.\nFill a 1.5 mL tube with Vetbond.\nPlace the isoflurane-soaked fabric in an acrylic anesthetic container. Place a pup in the container and anesthetize.\nCritical: Pay attention to the pup’s breathing during anesthesia at every step hereafter. A breathing arrest for a few seconds may stop the cerebral blood flow and cause critical brain damage even if the pup recovers normal breathing and movement later.\nPlace the pup in front of a tube cup where isoflurane gas (2.0%–2.5% in air) exits.\nNote: To make the procedure easier, secure the tube cup to the stage with cellophane tape.Make a scalp incision of ∼5 mm in diameter to expose the skull and view the location of GCaMP expression using the fluorescence stereo microscope (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). Euthanize pups that have inappropriate expressions. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nRemove the scalp above the cerebral hemispheres with scissors to as wide as possible, especially on the side of making a cranial window.\nNote: Avoid cutting the large blood vessels such as the branches of superficial temporal vein and supraorbital vein near the ears and eyes.\nWipe the skull with a saline-soaked cotton swab or use tweezers to remove connective tissue above the skull.",
    "Wipe the skull with a dry cotton swab, and wait until the skull dries.\nApply Vetbond to fix the incised surface of the scalp to the skull.\nNote: Avoid VetBond attaching to the location to make a cranial window.\nAfter fixing the incised scalp surface for one round, wait for a few minutes, and then fix it for another round.\nNote: Incomplete fixation can cause: (a) difficulty in holding the pup’s head to open the skull hole with a razor blade (step 43), (b) scalp bleeding which makes the cranial window opaque, and (c) displacement of the brain region during imaging when the pup moves.\nReturn the pup to a plastic container on a 37°C heating pad to recover from anesthesia. Wait for at least 15 min to let Vetbond solidify.\nPause point: The pup can be kept in a plastic container on a 37°C heating pad for ∼1 h. Do not return the pup to the mouse cage, as the mother mouse often gnaws the Vetbond to bleed.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S1. Selection of GCaMP-positive pup during surgery, related to step 23\n    \nAn example movie showing GCaMP fluorescent changes observed through the skull in a P5 pup. The movie is shown at 3.2× faster than real time. Right: anterior, left: posterior, top: medial, bottom: lateral.\nPreparation for cranial window surgery\nTiming: 10 min\nThis section describes the steps to prepare for cranial window surgery (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2650-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Set-up and procedures of cranial window surgery\n(A) Operation desk set-up.\n(B) A mouse pup under isoflurane anesthesia.",
    "(C) Craniotomy. Curve the razor blade (reverse to the curvature of the skull) and insert the corner of the blade from the anterior side where a cranial window should be made (C1). Push the blade forward diagonally and slowly to shave off the skull and make a hole of appropriate size (C2). Pinch the cracked skull with tweezers and peel it off (C3). Rinse the brain surface with cortex buffer quickly using a micropipette until the bleeding stops completely. Put gelfoam to stop bleeding if needed (C4).\n(D) After positioning a cover glass and adding agarose, remove any agarose on the glass and any agarose distant from the glass edge (about 0.5 mm) with tweezers (D1, D2). Agarose should be completely covered by resin (D3).\n(E) An example image of a cranial window.\nAdd cortex buffer into a 50 mL conical tube and maintain it at 20°C–25°C.\nNote: The solution should be kept at 20°C–25°C as warming the cortex facilitates bleeding during cranial window surgery (step 45).\nPrepare agarose solution.\nPut 5 mL of cortex buffer and 0.05 g of agarose (Sigma, cat. no. A9793, gel point 36°C ± 1.5°C) in a 50 mL conical tube without the lid. Microwave the solution to dissolve agarose.\nNote: The solution should be almost boiled to dissolve agarose completely. Avoid overheating, to prevent the conical tube from bursting.\nTake ∼1 mL of agarose solution in a 1.5 mL tube and maintain it at 42°C with a table-top incubator.\nSelect a titanium bar whose screw holes fit the screw holes of the titanium plate.\nNote: Because titanium bars are thin and soft, some have screw holes that are unfit for the holes of the titanium plate.\nDilute analgesic (50 mg/mL carprofen, Rimadyl, Zoetis JP) 100× with saline to prepare analgesic solution.",
    "Fold razor blades into four pieces.\nTake some gelfoam (Pfizer No.12), tear it into small pieces (∼2 mm in diameter), and place them in a cortex buffer in a small container (e.g., a cap of a conical tube).\nCranial window surgery\nTiming: 0.5–1 h/pup\nThis section describes the steps to make an imaging window.\nSterilize scissors, tweezers, and razor blades with 70% ethanol.\nTurn on a timer to record the time taken for the surgery.\nAnesthetize a pup with isoflurane in an acrylic anesthetic container.\nPlace the pup on a heating pad (35°C) under the stereo microscope. Place the tube cup where isoflurane gas (2.0%–2.5% in air) exits in front of the pup’s nose (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nObserve GCaMP fluorescence using a fluorescence stereo microscope and mark the place to make a cranial window with a marker.\nApply one drop of cortex buffer to the skull of the hemisphere where a window should be made.\nNote: Keep the skull wet while making a hole to prevent the dura from sticking to the razor blade and tearing.\nWipe away any blood on the skull, using a cotton swab wet with cortex buffer.\nNote: Be careful not to make the skull too wet; otherwise, the Vetbond adhesion may be loosened.\nRotate the mouse so that the skull area where a cranial window should be made comes upward.\nCurve the razor blade in reverse to the curvature of the skull, and insert the corner of the blade from the anterior side where the cranial window should be made (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C1).\nPush the blade forward diagonally and slowly to shave off the skull and make a hole of an appropriate size (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C2).",
    "Note: If there is strong resistance while inserting the blade, only the surface of the skull has been cut. The resistance decreases when the blade penetrates the skull. However, because the dura should remain intact, avoid inserting the blade too deep.\nNote: Replace the blade when it is no longer sharp.\nPinch the cracked skull with tweezers and remove it (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C3). If a hole is successfully made, blood vessels can be seen.\nNote: Bleeding tends to occur with the force of peeling off. Another choice is to rotate the razor blade 90° and cut the peeled bone away after a hole of the appropriate size is made.\nIf there is bleeding, quickly rinse the brain surface with cortex buffer using a micropipette. Repeat rinsing until the bleeding stops completely (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C4).\nNote: If a blood clot is formed on the brain surface, take a piece of gelfoam with tweezers and gently wipe the surface to remove the clot. If the bleeding does not stop, place gelfoam in the bleeding position and let the blood soak into gelfoam (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C4). This will help to stop the bleeding, although the position covered by gelfoam tends to form a blood stain.\nAfter the bleeding completely stops, apply one drop of cortex buffer on the cranial bone hole, and place a 3-mm-diameter round cover glass over the hole.\nNote: If bleeding occurs at steps 43–45, wait a few minutes before moving on to the next step to improve the hemostasis and to reduce the risk of rebleeding.\nAfter the buffer around the glass has dried, quickly apply warm agarose solution around the edge of the glass using a micropipette.",
    "Note: During this step bleeding commonly occurs because vasodilation results from applying a warm agarose solution. If bleeding occurs, remove the glass and agarose, and restart from step 45. The glass can be reused after rinsing.\nCritical: Bleeding must be completely stopped. If bleeding occurs under the cover glass, imaging becomes impossible.\nRemove the agarose on the glass approximately 0.5 mm distant from the glass edge with tweezers (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D1). Only cover the outer periphery of the glass with agarose (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D2).\nNote: If air bubbles appear under the window, remove the glass and agarose, and retry from step 47.\nWait for the agarose to harden. Absorb any liquid on the skull with non-woven fabric and dry the skull entirely.\nNote: Agarose gel shrinks as it hardens. If a space appears under the glass, add more agarose so that the agarose will finally cover the entire edge of the glass.\nMix acrylic resin liquid and powder in a rubber container and aspirate this with a micropipette.\nPour the resin on the skull away from the glass little by little and check the resin’s hardness (resin hardens even after being aspirated by a micropipette). When the resin gets hard enough so that it does not flow laterally, fix the outer edge of the glass quickly.\nNote: If the resin is placed while too fluid, it will flow under the glass and make imaging impossible.\nNote: Cover the agarose completely with resin (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D3); otherwise, cerebral fluid will exit through the agarose and cause brain damage.\nFix the titanium bar with resin on the hemisphere contralateral to the window. Keep the bar angle parallel to the cover glass.\nNote: If the titanium bar fixation is not tight enough, pup respiration makes imaging plane displacement during imaging.",
    "Fix the entire skull surface with resin (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nAfter the surgery is finished, inject analgesics (carprofen 100× solutions, 0.1 μL/g weight; carprofen 5 μg/g weight) under the skin at the back of the neck.\nReturn the pup to a plastic container on a 37°C heating pad to recover from anesthesia.\nRecord the time required for the surgery.\nWait for >60 min to solidify resin before imaging.\nNote: Because isoflurane anesthesia suppresses cortical activity in neonatal brain,2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3],9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9],10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] waiting before imaging is important to observe normal activity.\nPause point: The pup can be kept in a plastic container on a 37°C heating pad for a few hours. Do not return the pup to the mouse cage, as the mother mouse often gnaws the resin and exposes the brain.\nTwo-photon microscopy set-up\nTiming: ∼10 min\nThis section describes the steps required for two-photon imaging.\nTurn on the microscope controller, confocal unit, PC, LasX, and Alcor Laser for GCaMP imaging.\nSet a stage plate with XY positioning (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Attach a two-axis goniometer (ThorLabs GN2) with a titanium plate (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) and a pillar with a tube cup where isoflurane gas exits to the stage plate.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2650-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Averaging: none.\nPreparation for two-photon imaging\nTiming: 10 min/pup\nThis section describes the preparation for two-photon microscopy.\nTurn on a timer to record the time taken for imaging.\nAnesthetize a pup with isoflurane in an acrylic anesthetic container.\nPlace the pup on a heating pad. Fix the titanium bar on the pup’s head to the titanium plate with screws (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). Place the tube cup for isoflurane gas (2.0% in air) on the pup’s mouth.\nAdjust the window angle horizontally via the goniometer.\nWipe the window softly with an ethanol-soaked cotton swab to remove any dust.\nAdjust the XY position of the stage to locate the window under the 5× objective lens (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nTurn on the backlight and ensure the window is visible through the eyepiece.\nNote: The field of view through the eyepiece is usually rotated 180° from the actual orientation.\nPut eye drops (Scopisol) on the cranial window and switch to the 25× water-immersion objective lens.\nNote: Scopisol is recommended as this dehydrates more slowly than water does.\nAdjust the z-position and make the window visible through the eyepiece. Confirm that blood flow is seen.\nNote: The window angle can be again adjusted in this step. Blood vessels are good landmarks to ensure that the brain surface is horizontal.\nNote: If blood flow is not seen in any or all the blood vessels, the pup may have received too much isoflurane in the previous steps.\nTurn off the backlight.\nStart Las X scanning using the one-photon mode. Increase the laser power for green fluorescence so that the autofluorescence of the glass or the brain surface is visible.\nLower the isoflurane concentration to 1.2%–1.5%.\nCover the microscope with a blackout curtain and turn off the room lights.\nNote: Avoid intense light entering the microscope afterwards.",
    "Two-photon imaging of spontaneous neuronal activity\nTiming: 0.5–1 h/pup\nThis section describes steps for imaging spontaneous neuronal activity by two-photon microscopy.\nSwitch the imaging software to the two-photon mode.\nTurn on the MP laser shutter for green fluorescence imaging. Select the imaging area and conditions. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nAdjust XYZ position to the field of interest where GCaMP positive cells are visible.\nIncrease the detector gain to 80%.\nIncrease the laser power. If the signal remains low, increase the detector gain to 100%.\nNote: To avoid bleaching, increase the laser power gradually. The required laser power may change for GECI-expressing transgenic animals.\nSet time-lapse imaging parameters.\nSet the scan rate to >1 Hz to observe the calcium transients in neonates.\nSet the number of frames to scan >20 min.\nStart time-lapse imaging and acquire GCaMP signals (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2650-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Two-photon imaging of spontaneous neuronal activity\nTwo-photon images obtained from a Supernova GCaMP6s-electroporated P5 pup.\n(A) Baseline signals obtained during anesthesia.\n(B and C) Representative GCaMP fluorescent changes (GCaMP-labeled cells with arrows).\nAfter 5 min of scanning of baseline activities, turn off the isoflurane.\nNote: After ∼5 min from the isoflurane offset, calcium transients will appear. After ∼10 min from isoflurane offset, activity level becomes normal (see limitations[href=https://www.wicell.org#limitations]).\nWhen the pup becomes too active for imaging, quit imaging and anesthetize the pup by administering isoflurane (2% in air).\nAfter the pup relaxes, repeat imaging from step 78. XYZ positions can be changed to scan another area as well.\nWhen enough data has been obtained, end the session.\n(optional) Euthanize the pup with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital. Fix the pup by transcardial perfusion of PBS, followed by 4% PFA. Remove the brain and post-fix in 4% PFA for 12∼16 h to proceed with additional observation or immunohistochemistry.\nAnalysis",
    "Timing: ∼1 h/pup\nThis section describes steps to analyze spontaneous synchronous activity.\nOpen the imaging files with image analysis software such as Image with Fiji.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]\nAdjust XY drift between the time-lapse images using two-dimensional cross-correlation.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] Remove images whose drift cannot be adjusted by this operation.\nSelect regions of interest (ROIs) for the analysis of GCaMP fluorescence changes. For the analysis of fluorescence in single cells, locate <20 μm-diameter circles on the center of GCaMP-labeled cells (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2650-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nObtain F from the ROIs. To avoid the effects of anesthesia, use movies after 10 min after stopping isoflurane.\nCalculate a threshold, the mean + 1 × standard deviation of the F wave.\nObtain F0 by averaging the F wave below the threshold.\nObtain Fb by conducting a square box scanning (the pixel number must be approximately equal to the pixel numbers in the ROI) on the first image of the movie, and calculating the minimum value of the scan.\nUsing software such as Microsoft Excel, calculate Pearson’s correlation coefficient by using dF/F obtained from each GCaMP-labeled cell, and generate a correlation matrix (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nNote: Correlation between inactive cells (unhealthy or dead cells) will be high. Therefore, only use active cells (we used cells that showed ≥5 calcium transients in 10 min)."
