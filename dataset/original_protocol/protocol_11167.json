    "All research methods using zebrafish and animal care/maintenance were performed in compliance with the institutional guidelines at Mayo Clinic.\n1. Preparation and microinjection of transgene constructs for the development of LMO1 transgenic zebrafish line with overexpression in PSNS\nTo develop the LMO1-pDONR221 entry clone, amplify the coding region of human LMO1 from cDNA obtained from human cell line using PCR.\n\t\nMake a 25 µL reaction as detailed here: 2.5 µL of 10x standard Taq Reaction Buffer, 0.125 µL of Taq DNA Polymerase, 0.5 µL of 10 mM dNTPs, 2 µL of cDNA template, 0.5 µL of 10 µM forward LMO1 ATTB1 primer, 0.5 µL of 10 µM reverse LMO1 ATTB2 primer, and 18.875 µL of water.\n\t\t​NOTE: Use forward LMO1 ATTB1 primer: 5'-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTACAC-3'.\n\t\tCATGATGGTGCTGGACAAGGAGGA-3' and reverse LMO1 ATTB2 primer: 5'-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTTTACT\n\t\tGAACTTGGGATTCAAAGGT-3'\nAmplify using the following program: 1 cycle of 94 °C, 2 min; followed by 30 cycles of (94 °C, 30 s, 55 °C, 30 s, 72 °C, 1 min) and 72 °C, 7 min.\nClone LMO1 PCR product into the pDONR221 gateway donor vector by BP recombinase reaction6,13 (PCR fragment + Donor vector = Entry Clone).\n\t\nFor a 10 µL reaction, mix 1 µL of purified LMO1 PCR product (150 ng/µL), 1 µL (150 ng/µL) pDONR221 donor vector, and 6 µL of TE buffer (pH 8.0) with 2 µL of BP enzyme mix, incubate for 1 h at 25 °C, and transform to TOP10 competent E. coli using the manufacturer's protocol.\nNext, spread 50-200 µL from the transformation vial on a Luria Broth (LB) agar plate containing 50 µg/mL kanamycin and incubate at 37 °C overnight.\nSelect clones by inoculating a single colony into 2-5 mL of LB with 50 µg/mL kanamycin and culturing overnight (16-18 h) at 37 °C.",
    "Use 2 mL of overnight bacterial culture for plasmid isolation according to the manufacturer's protocol. To verify the LMO1 plasmid, send plasmid sample out for sequencing with M13-F primer (5- GTAAAACGACGGCCAG-3').\nTo generate a dβh-pDONRP4-P1R entry clone, obtain dβh PCR product6,13 by amplifying the 5.2-kb promotor region using the CH211-270H11 BAC clone as template to prepare a 20 µL reaction as previously described in step 1.1.1. Use the following PCR program parameters: 94 °C, 2 min; 10 cycles of 94 °C, 15 s, 50 °C, 30 s, 68 °C, 8 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C, 15 s, 53 °C, 30 s, 68 °C, 8 min; 68 °C, 4 min (with forward primer 5'GGGGACAACTTTGTATAGAAAAGTTGGCGTACTC\n\tCCCCTTTTTAGG-3' and reverse primer 5'-GGGGACTGCTTTTTTGTACAAACTTGTGTTGCTTTG\n\tTCGTCTTTTGA-3').\n\tNOTE: Due to the long DNA templates in this step, ensure usage of an appropriate PCR system for accurate PCR amplification.\nClone dβh PCR product into the pDONRP4-P1R gateway donor vector by BP recombinase reaction6,13 (PCR fragment + Donor vector = Entry Clone).\n\t\nMix 1 µL of purified dβh PCR product (172 ng/uL), 1 µL (150 ng/µL) of pDONRP4-P1R donor vector, and 6 µL of TE buffer (pH 8.0) with 2 µL of BP enzyme mix in a total of 10 µL reaction, incubate for 1 h at 25 °C.\nTransform to TOP10 competent E. coli according to the manufacturer's protocol. Isolate the plasmid as described in steps 1.2.2-1.2.4 and verify plasmid by sequencing with M13-F (5'-GTAAAACGACGGCCAG-3') and M13-R (5'-CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-3') primers.\nGenerate the dβh:LMO1 expression construct.\n\t\nCombine 1 µL of each entry clone (dβh-pDONRP4-P1R, LMO1-pDONR221 and p3E-polyA11) (20 fmole each), 1 µL (60 ng/µL) of modified destination vector with I-SceI recognition sites, and 4 µL of TE buffer (pH 8.0) containing 2 µL of the LR recombinase enzyme mix. Incubate this mixture for 1 h at 25 °C.",
    "While following the manufacturer's protocol, transform bacteria to chemically competent TOP10 E. coli. Isolate plasmid as described in steps 1.2.2-1.2.4 and verify plasmid by sequencing with DBH Forward (5'-GAAGCTGTCACAGGGTTGTG-3') and LMO1 (5'-GGCATTGGACAAGTACTGGCA-3') primers.\nGenerate dβh:mCherry DNA construct with a gateway system by combining entry clones of a 5.2-kb dβh promoter, pME-mCherry, and p3E-polyA into the modified destination vector containing I-SceI recognition sites as mentioned previously in step 1.5.16. Isolate plasmid as described in steps 1.2.2-1.2.4 and verify plasmid by sequencing with DBH Forward primer (5'-GAAGCTGTCACAGGGTTGTG-3').\nLinearize dβh:LMO1 DNA construct and dβh:mCherry DNA construct (at a 3:1 ratio, respectively) in a total of a 15 µL reaction volume with 1 µL of I-SceI enzyme (5 U/µL) and 0.75 µL of buffer (10x), and incubate at room temperature for a minimum of 4 h or overnight. Ensure that DNA concentration does not exceed 750 ng in reaction.\nNext day and after linearization of constructs, add 0.5 µL of fresh I-SceI enzyme (5 U/µL) and 0.5 µL of 0.5% phenol red into 5 µL of total DNA mixture from previous step of 1.7. Microinject the total solution (of 50-80 pg of linearized DNA) into one-cell-stage wild-type AB embryos (and as many as 500 embryos) using 1.0 mm diameter glass micropipette needle as previously described17. Store the remaining DNA mixture at -20 °C for future injections.\n2. Screen and verify LMO1 transgenic fish line for germline transmission of LMO1 and mCherry\nAt 3-4 days-post-fertilization (dpf), anesthetize injected embryos with 0.02% tricaine and screen them for fluorescent mCherry expression, which presents anywhere throughout the fish body due to the mosaic transgenesis. Transfer mCherry-positive embryos into a Petri dish with fresh egg water and raise embryos to sexual maturity in accordance with the zebrafish book21.",
    "NOTE: Expect the ratio of positive fish to vary depending on the expertise and experience of research personnel. For example, beginning amateurs may have a low integration rate of 10%, compared to an expert's of ≥50%.\nTo determine the founder fish with dβh:LMO1 and dβh:mCherry transgenes integrated into germ cells, outcross single pairs of injected mCherry-positive F0 sexually matured fish from previous step (2.1) with WT AB fish. Screen the F1 generation for mCherry-positive embryos at 3-4 dpf.\nTo confirm that the mCherry-positive fish carry LMO1 transgene, isolate the gDNA from F1 mCherry-positive single embryo using the gDNA extraction buffer, which contains: 12.5 µL of 4x lysis buffer (500 µL of 1 M Tris with pH of 8.4, 2.5 mL of 1 M potassium chloride, and 47 mL of purified water), 35 µL of purified water, and 2.5 µL of proteinase K at 10 mg/mL. Incubate the sample for 16 h at 55 °C, followed by 10 min at 98 °C.\nUse the extracted gDNA (2 µL) as a template for the genotyping PCR with primers: LMO1 FW: 5'-GGCATTGGACAAGTACTGGCA -3' and LMO1 RV: 5'-CGAAGGCTGGGATCAGCTTG -3', and the following PCR program: 1 cycle of 94 °C, 10 min; 35 cycles of (94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s; 68 °C, 30 s); and 68 °C for 7 min. Confirm the amplified 182 bp fragment by sequencing.\nAfter confirmation of the genotype, raise the remaining mCherry-positive F1 embryos to maturity in accordance with the standard guidelines of the zebrafish book21. Fin clip and genotype them at 2-3 months of age using steps 2.3-2.4 from the protocol above to further confirm the integration of the LMO1 transgene in the fish.\n\tNOTE: The LMO1-positive F1 fish will be the stable transgenic fish [Tg(dβh:LMO1),Tg(dβh:mCherry)] (designated as LMO1 line).",
    "Breed F1 LMO1 stable transgenic fish with WT fish and repeat as needed to propagate this line.\n3. Outcross of LMO1  and MYCN  transgenic lines to create metastatic model\nOnce the LMO1 transgenic zebrafish line is generated, interbreed with MYCN line6,17 to develop heterozygous transgenic fish line overexpressing both MYCN and LMO1.\nAt 1 dpf, sort the progeny of outcross for EGFP expression with stereoscopic fluorescence microscope, which presents as EGFP-positive points in the hindbrain region.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, if not all embryos are sorted for MYCN at 1 dpf, raise the embryos to adulthood and genotype by fin clipping and using formerly stated guidelines from steps 2.3-2.4 for gDNA isolation and PCR genotyping, with primers: MYCN-F (5'-ATT CAC CAT CAC TGT GCG TCC-3'); MYCN-R (5'-TGC ATC CTC ACT CTC CAC GTA-3', and the following program with standard Taq polymerase: 1 cycle of 94 °C for 3 min, 35 cycles of (94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 3 min), and 68 °C for 7 min with expected amplicon size of 145 bp.\nAfter sorting for EGFP at 1 dpf, isolate screened embryos into separate Petri dishes and label dishes as: MYCN+ (EGFP-positive) or MYCN- (EGFP-negative).\nAt 3-4 dpf, visualize and sort embryos of both groups (step 3.3) for LMO1 expression with a stereoscopic fluorescence microscope. Look for red fluorescent protein expression as spots in both the superior cervical ganglion and non-PSNS dopaminergic neuronal cells in the head region, especially in oblongata medulla of the hindbrain6,13.\n\tNOTE: Screen for mCherry/LMO1 before embryos reach 5 dpf, because air-filled swim bladders fully develop by then and will cause the embryos to float, resulting in difficult microscopic focusing of the PSNS cells during the sorting process.",
    "Once sorting is completed, isolate sorted fish into four groups of different genotypes and label as below. Raise the sorted fish in identical conditions according to the standard protocols from the zebrafish book21.\n\t\nMYCN-only (EGFP-positive),\nLMO1-only (mCherry-positive),\nMYCN; LMO1 (EGFP and mCherry double positive),\nWT (EGFP and mCherry double negative).\n4. Visualizing tumor burden in transgenic zebrafish lines\nAt 4 weeks-post-fertilization (wpf), anesthetize sorted fish from step 3.5 with 0.02% tricaine in a petri dish.\nVisualize tumors with a stereoscopic fluorescence microscope by gently flipping fish with a metal spatula onto both lateral sides to view tumor. Expect tumors to present as single EGFP-, single mCherry-, or double EGFP-and-mCherry-positive masses that arise from the interrenal gland region (near head and kidney).\n\tNOTE: It is possible that the initial tumor onset is typically presented with a brighter and larger fluorescence positive mass on one side of interrenal gland, which is why it is crucial to visualize both sides of fish to avoid missing early tumor onset.\nAfter identification of the possible tumor-bearing fish, isolate fish into a separate tank with appropriate labels, which includes date of birth, date when tumor screened, and genotype.\nAt 6 wpf, repeat previous steps 4.1-4.3 to screen tumor-bearing fish and non-tumor bearing fish again to confirm the presence of tumors for previously screened tumor-bearing fish or identify new possible tumor-bearing fish, respectively. Look for sustained or increased size of fluorescence-positive mass in confirmed tumor-bearing fish.\nAfter identifying tumor-bearing fish, monitor them biweekly for evidence of tumor cell migration, which presents as tiny EGFP- and/or mCherry-positive tumor masses far from the primary site of tumorgenesis (interrenal gland region). Isolate these fish into separate tanks as needed and label appropriately to indicate possible metastasis.",
    "To further confirm the metastasis, continue tracking these fish regularly (every two weeks) until the distant fluorescence-positive tumor masses show clearly increased size, indicating growth of tumors in the metastatic sites.\n5. Tissue processing and paraffin sectioning of tumor-bearing fish\nNOTE: Perform this step to characterize the spontaneously developed primary and/or metastatic tumors in MYCN and MYCN;LMO1 transgenic fish.\nAfter identification and verification of tumor-bearing fish, sacrifice fish from step 4.6 in a Petri dish by submerging fish in 0.02% tricaine to anesthetize first and then increasing tricaine dosage until fish is no longer respiring. Cut the fish into two pieces-with one piece containing the head and a portion of the body's middle section (including tumor), and another piece with the rest of the fish's middle section and tail.\nFix both fish sections with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 1x PBS for 1 h at room temperature on a rocker. To enhance fixation efficiency, replace buffer with fresh 4% PFA to increase penetrance to the internal organs effectively and quickly. Leave fish with fresh fixing buffer on a rocker at 4 °C overnight or for 48 h.\n\tCAUTION: PFA is toxic. Since precautionary procedures and proper disposal of reagent depends on the regulations of your institution, seek proper guidelines before using and disposal of reagent.\nPrior to the processing, place sample(s) in 100% rapid decalcifier solution for 15-20 min at room temperature. Make sure to use a nonmetal container and to check sample(s) throughout incubation to prevent over decalcification. If sample tissue looks heavily degraded, place sample in water or at 4 °C to slow down the decalcification process.",
    "Once fixed and decalcified, wash fish sample(s) with running tap water for 1 h and place it into processor cassette(s). If there is more than one sample, separate each into its own cassette.\nDehydrate and prepare the tissue for paraffin embedding by placing cassette(s) with fish into the tissue processor where the sample(s) are submerged in various solutions, respectively, as follows: 70% ethanol (60 min, 40 °C), 85% ethanol (50 min, 40 °C), 95% ethanol (40 min, 40 °C) twice, 100% ethanol (30 min, 40 °C), another fresh solution of 100% ethanol (50 min, 40 °C) twice, xylene (30 min, 40 °C), another fresh solution of xylene (50 min, 40 °C), another fresh xylene (50 min, 45 °C), paraffin (30 min, 45 °C), paraffin (20 min, 58 °C) three times.\nAfter the tissue is processed, unload the cassette(s) from the processor machine while maintaining organization of each cassette and making sure to prevent mixing up the fish samples.\nChoose the appropriate sized mold based on the size of the fish, making sure the mold will fit the entire cassette with the fish sample. Cover the bottom of the mold with liquid paraffin at 60 °C.\nImmediately place cassette with the fish on top of mold (making sure the fish is laid on its flat lateral side for sagittal sections) with liquid paraffin, and finish filling with paraffin to the top of the mold to completely embed the fish.\nPlace the completed mold on the cold plate of the sectioning microtome until the paraffin is hardened.\nOnce the paraffin block is hard, which can be judged by visually observing higher opacity and a firm touch to the block, gently remove the block from the mold. Carefully scrape off any excess paraffin from the sides of the cassette.",
    "Section the paraffin-embedded fish block sagittally at 4 microns on the microtome and float the sections on a warm water bath at 40 °C containing distilled water.\nCarefully transfer the sections onto positively charged slides and bake in oven at 60 °C for 30 min prior to staining before proceeding to either step 6, 7, or 8.\n6. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of paraffin sections for pathology review\nPlace slides containing paraffin sections from step 5.12 into a slide holder. Inside a chemical fume hood, deparaffinize with xylene 3 times, 5 min each. Discard solution after each use.\nRehydrate sections with 100% ethanol for 3 min, and repeat twice with fresh 100% ethanol. Replace 100% ethanol with 95% ethanol for 3 min and then, 80% ethanol for 3 min.\nRinse sections with distilled water for 5 min. While the sections are washing in water, make sure to remove oxidized particles from hematoxylin by either filtering or skimming surface of hematoxylin with a lint-free wipe.\nBlot the excess water from the slide holder with lint-free professional grade wipes, and stain slides in 50% hematoxylin (1:1 dilution with distilled water) for 2-5 min depending on desired staining preference and reagent deterioration. Discard hematoxylin when solution color changes from plum to blue/brown or when staining time becomes excessive. Rinse the slides with running tap water for 20 min.\nDecolorize the sections in 1% acid ethanol (3.3 mL of Hydrochloric acid with 50 mL of 70% ethanol) by quickly dipping the slides multiple times. Slides can be dipped up to 3 s, but the longer the slides are dipped, the lighter the sections become.",
    "Rinse the slides in tap water twice for 1 min each, and once with deionized water. As an option, slides can be left overnight at this stage, soaking in water.\nImmerse the sections in 1.36% lithium carbonate solution (47 g lithium carbonate, 3500 mL water) for 3 s. Make sure not to over incubate the sections since the longer the time in lithium carbonate solution, the more likely the tissue will float.\nRinse the sections in tap water for 5 min, and blot the excess water from the slide holder with lint-free professional grade wipes.\nCounterstain the slides in 100% ready-to-use eosin for 15-30 s, and immediately dehydrate with 95% ethanol twice for 5 min each. Replace with 100% ethanol twice for 5 min each, discarding the solutions after each use.\nClear the sections in xylene for 15 min and repeat twice for 3 times in total. Optionally, the slides can be left in xylene overnight at room temperature to better clear excess water.\nAllow the slides to air dry in the chemical fume hood and then mount a cover slip using mounting medium to seal tissue sample.\nVisualize and image the stained tissue sections under microscopy. Carefully examine the tumors at the primary site (the interrenal gland region in head kidney) and the distant sporadic metastases in other tissues and organs of the fish. Send out stained slides for tissue sections to be reviewed by pathologists. Based on the fish model's similar pathological features to human neuroblastoma, expect the tumors that arose in MYCN-only or MYCN;LMO1 fish to be first diagnosed as neuroblastoma by pathologists.\n7. Immunohistochemical Analysis (IHC) with antibodies against NB marker and overexpressed transgenes to further confirm the spread of tumor and their sympathoadrenal lineage property\nStaining with fully automatic staining system",
    "To better compare the IHC result with that of H&E staining, select adjacent slides from step 5.12 for IHC staining.\n\t\t​NOTE: Although an automated staining system allows for faster and less laborious results, a manual protocol for IHC staining can be used in the absence of such by referring to steps of subsection 7.2.\nDilute the primary antibody against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (1:500), a neuroblastoma marker, based on desired concentration and total amount needed with the automated system's corresponding Primary Antibody Diluent.\n\t\t​NOTE: Optimal antibody concentrations may vary depending on antibody and tissue.\nSince the automated system uses onboard heat-induced antigen retrieval with epitope retrieval solution for 20 min and the system's corresponding detection reagent, ensure the parameters for the machine are set as: Peroxidase Blocking, 5 min; Primary antibody with desired concentration, 15 min; biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:500), 8 min; Streptavidin HRP, 8 min; mixed DAB intense substrate, 5 min; and Hematoxylin, 5 min.\nOnce the settings are set, place the antibody tray into the machine. Set up the slides by creating a new case, which will label the slides. The machine is now loaded and ready to run (dewaxing, staining, and counterstaining).\nOnce the slides are dewaxed, stained, and counterstained using the automated machine, dehydrate the slides in ethanol gradients of 70%, 95%, and 100% for 5 min each. Submerge slides of sections in 100% fresh ethanol again for 5 min.\nClear the sections in xylene for 5 min, twice, or leave slides in xylene overnight to better clear excess water.\nAllow the slides to air dry in the chemical fume hood and then mount a cover slip using a mounting medium. Visualize and image the stained tissue sections with microscopy.",
    "To firmly confirm metastasis in the fish model, compare the slides stained with antibodies against neuroblastoma marker from step 7 to those stained by H&E from step 6.\n\t\tNOTE: Expect to see positive staining for neuroblastoma marker, TH, in all tumor cells identified by H&E staining. Also expect no positive staining for TH in adjacent tissues where the metastatic tumors were identified in LMO1;MYCN fish. Make sure to select control WT and MYCN-only fish that are of similar age to MYCN;LMO1 fish for this analysis to rule out the possibility that the metastatic tumors are multifocal primary tumors.\nManually staining without automated IHC staining system\n\t\nAfter the slides are baked, select adjacent slides from step 5.12 to allow better comparison between H&E and IHC staining to deparaffinize. Inside a chemical fume hood, dewax and rehydrate the slides with xylene using previous steps 6.1 and 6.2., respectively.\nAfter deparaffinization and rehydration, soak slides in endogenous peroxide blocking solution (1x PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide and 0.3% hydrogen peroxide) for 5 min at room temperature. Wash slides in fresh 1x PBS for 3 min and repeat twice for a total of 3 times.\n\t\tCAUTION: Sodium azide is acutely toxic. Ensure to practice precautionary procedures and proper disposal of reagent depending on the regulations of your institution.\nRetrieve antigen by incubating slides in solution with proteinase K (1:500 in 1x PBS) for 10 min at room temperature. Wash slides 3 times with 1x PBS for 3 min each.\nBlock slides by incubating with 5% goat serum in 1x PBS for 30 min at room temperature on rocker. Wash slides with fresh 1x PBS twice for 3 min each.",
    "Add 4 drops of Avidin blocking solution directly onto slide and incubate for 15 min at room temperature. After washing slides with fresh 1x PBS twice for 3 min each, add 4 drops of Biotin blocking solution and incubate at room temperature for 15 min.\nAfter blocking slides, incubate in primary antibody of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (1:500) for 45-60 min at room temperature, or overnight at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Stain with additional antibodies against transgenes and other relevant markers to address physiology and activity of primary tumor and other metastatic sites. Optimal antibody concentrations may vary depending on antibody and tissue.\nWash slides with fresh 1x PBS for 3 min, repeating twice with a total of 3 times.\nIncubate slides in secondary antibody of biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:500) diluted in blocking solution for 45-60 min at room temperature. Repeat previous washing step 7.2.7.\nAdd HRP conjugated Avidin (1:300 in 1x PBS), and incubate for 20 min at room temperature. Wash slides 3 times with fresh 1x PBS for 5 min each.\nPrepare 3,3’-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) solution (2.5 mL distilled water, 1 drop of kit buffer, 1 drop of hydrogen peroxide, and 2 drops of DAB from kit), and place drops of DAB directly onto slides near a microscope. After adding DAB, observe the color change reaction on the slides under microscope. Once desired staining intensity is reached, stop reaction by placing slide sections in cold distilled water.\nCounterstain the slides with fresh 50% hematoxylin by submerging or dipping samples for a few short seconds and placing back into distilled water. Repeat as desired, but normally, once should be enough since tissue sections are thin.",
    "Dehydrate tissue samples on slides in alcohol gradient as previously described in step 7.1.5 and continue through the remaining steps (with the last step as 7.1.8) to finish the IHC analysis.\n8. Picrosirius red staining of paraffin slides for collagen accumulation in tumors as mechanism study\nRepeat steps 6.1-6.3 to dewax, hydrate, and wash paraffin sections on slides.\nAfter blotting the excess water from the slide holder with professional grade lint-free wipes, stain in 50% hematoxylin for 10 min. Rinse the slides with running tap water for 10 min.\nTransfer the slides into Picrosirius Red and incubate at room temperature for 1 h.\nWash the slides in acidified water (5 mL glacial acetic acid in 1 L of tap or distilled water) twice, incubating for 5 min on shaker.\nDecant most of the water from slides first before physically shaking and blotting sections on slides to remove as much water as possible.\nQuickly place slides into three changes of 100% ethanol to dehydrate paraffin sections.\nRepeat steps 6.10 and 6.11 to clear slides in xylene and mount sample. Next, image with compound microscope that is equipped with a camera.\nUsing ImageJ, count the picrosirius red-positive collagen fibers in at least three random fields for each section. Compare between slides of MYCN and MYCN;LMO1 fish sections.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
