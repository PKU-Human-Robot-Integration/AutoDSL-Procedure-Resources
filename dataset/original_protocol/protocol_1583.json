Preparation of the weighing paper and plastic sheet\n(A) Aluminum foil boat.\n(B and C) (B) Weighing paper and (C) plastic sheet are cut into appropriate sizes.\n(D) Cut weighing paper and plastic sheet are put in the aluminum boat over liquid nitrogen (LN2).\n(E) Setup: (a) Weighing paper, (b) Plastic sheet, (c) Aluminum boat, (d) LN2.\nCut the weighing paper into 15 mm squares (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) and the plastic sheet into 100 mm squares (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nFloat the aluminum foil boat on LN2 poured into the Styrofoam and place a plastic sheet in it. Finally, place the weighing paper on the plastic sheet (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D and 1E).\nNote: Pour LN2 into the Styrofoam right before freeze-drying to conserve LN2.\nNote: In areas with high humidity, we recommend using a lidded Styrofoam as an LN2 container.\nNote: Avoid adding too much LN2, as it might cause improper freezing of the sperm drops, which will later melt prematurely.\nCritical: LN2 must be handled with great care, as there are the risks of suffocation caused by saturation of nitrogen gas in the room and cold burns. It is recommended to wear specialized gloves and glasses when pouring LN2 into Styrofoam. Please ventilate and avoid closed spaces.\nPreparing the sperm\nTiming: 30 min–1 h\nSperm collection",
    "Euthanize mature mice (> three months old) by cervical dislocation and collect the epididymis (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1149-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Sperm collection from male mouse and pre-incubation\n(A) Reproductive organs of a male mouse. To collect condensed sperm mass, the cauda epididymides are separated from them. The red arrow indicates the testis and the green arrow indicates the cauda epididymis.\n(B) Collected cauda epididymis. Scale bar = 1 mm.\n(C) A small incision is made with a pair of fine scissors in the cauda epididymis after removing the adipose tissue and blood.\n(D and E) (D) Sperm mass is pushed out with fingers, picked up with tweezers, and (E) transferred into the HTF medium.\nRemove the fat and blood and cut the cauda epididymides using scissors (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). Push out the condensed sperm mass with your fingers (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D) and collect and deposit it into 200–500 μL of HTF medium (Quinn et al., 1995[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) using tweezers (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D and 2E). Pre-incubate the sperm mass for 30 min to 1 h in the incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nNote: The volume of the HTF medium can be adjusted according to the amount of collected sperm mass.\nOptional: Count the number of sperm and adjust the concentration of the sperm suspension (>1 × 106 sperm/ mL) by adding/removing HTF medium.\nNote: Before freeze-drying the sperm, it is better to check their quality and motility using inverted microscope. However, the sperm concentration is inconsequential as this method collects enough sperm for ICSI.\nNote: If the collected sperm are too poor to use in experiments (<1 × 106 sperm/ mL), please centrifuge the sperm suspension and reduce the HTF volume to increase the sperm concentration.\nFreeze-drying the sperm\nTiming: 7 h\nFreezing the sperm",
    "Drop 50 μL of pre-incubated sperm suspension onto the weighing paper floating in LN2 using a pipette (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1149-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Freezing process of the sperm suspension\nAfter pre-incubation for 30 min to 1 h in the incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2, sperm suspension in HTF medium are dropped on the weighing paper floating on LN2 and incubated for 10 min. (a) 200 μL yellow pipette tip. (b) 50 μL aliquot of the sperm suspension. (c) Weighing paper (cut into 15-mm squares). (d) Plastic sheet (Cut into 100-mm squares). (e) Aluminum boat. (f) LN2.\nLeave the sperm suspension to freeze inside the Styrofoam for 10 min.\nNote: Before dropping the sperm suspension, ensure that the weighing paper is cold enough to freeze the suspension.\nNote: If the lid of Styrofoam containing LN2 are opened for long time, the moisture in the air cools and condenses on weighing paper and plastic sheet but the inside of Styrofoam gets warm and the sperm drop does not freeze well, which disturb your operation. Therefore, it is recommended not to open the lid of Styrofoam for more than a minute.\nNote: Drop the sperm suspension on the weighing paper quickly; otherwise, it will freeze inside the pipet tip.\nDrying the frozen sperm\nImmediately after freezing the sperm drops for 10 min, transfer the aluminum boat into FreeZone® (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1149-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Drying process using vacuum dryer\n(A) FreeZone® (Labconco).\n(B) The weighing paper and plastic sheet in the aluminum boat are transferred the frozen sperm drop into the vacuum dryer.\n(C) A vacuum-proof lid covers the top of the dryer.",
    "(D–F) (D) During vacuum drying process of the frozen sperm drops for 6 h, the display and lamp are maintained as shown. The pressure is maintained at 0.100 mbar, and the temperature is maintained at −50°C. The sperm drop is shiny after freezing (E) and looks powder-like after drying (F).\nNote: Keep the weighing paper with the frozen sperm drop on the plastic sheet during vacuum drying for easy handling (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nCover the boat with vacuum-proof lids (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nStart the vacuum drying by pushing the vacuum button (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nNote: During the entire vacuum drying process, maintain the pressure at approximately 0.100 mBar and the temperature at −50°C inside the vacuum dryer (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nVacuum dry the frozen sperm drops for 6 h. The undried frozen drops are shiny (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E) but appear powder-like after drying (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F).\nCritical: Transfer the frozen sperm drops into the FreeZone® quickly to keep them from melting. Check the position and height of the lid, the contents inside the vacuum dryer, and vacuum dry the sheets within a few seconds.\nSealing the FD sperm\nAfter drying is complete, set the vacuum dryer to ambient pressure by removing the rubber stopper.\nTake out the plastic sheet with the weighing paper and FD sperm from the dryer (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1149-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Inserting FD sperm between the plastic sheets\n(A) FD sperm placed on the plastic sheet are removed from the vacuum dryer at ambient pressure.\n(B) Another weighing paper (15-mm squares) is put on each FD sperm drop and pressed with tweezers.\n(C) Sealing the glued sheet with fingers to release excess air.\n(D) FD sperm are stored between the plastic sheets.\nCover each pellet of FD sperm with another weighing paper (cut in 15-mm squares) using tweezers (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).",
    "Cover the FD sperm with a glued plastic sheet and press the sheet using fingers (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C and 5D).\nNote: Be careful while sticking the plastic sheets together as the weighing paper and the FD sperm might move due to static electricity.\nNote: Remove as much air as possible while sealing the plastic sheets (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nPreserving the FD sperm\nTiming: At least 3 months in a freezer\nStore all the samples in a Sperm book (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A and 6B) at −30°C until further use (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1149-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Storing and transporting of FD sperm preserved in plastic sheets\n(A) Sperm book.\n(B) A card file can compactly store several sheets containing FD sperm.\n(C–E) (C) FD sperm in plastic sheets can be stored for three months at −30°C. Before mailing, the sheets storing FD sperm are (D) put in an envelope or (E) attached to a postcard.\nNote: Files with multiple pages are useful for storing several samples (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A and 6B). We call this the Sperm Book.\nCritical: FD sperm can be stored at 15°C–25°C only for three days.\nDomestically mailing the FD sperm\nTiming: 1–2 days\nStore the plastic sheet containing FD sperm at −30°C until mailing.\nPlace the sheets in an envelope (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D) or tightly attach them to a postcard using sticky tape to prevent them from peeling off (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]E).\nRemove the sheets from the freezer on the day of mailing and post the envelope or postcards containing the sheets.\nFor domestic mail, the sheets will be delivered within a few days. Once received, store the sheets again at −30°C until further use.\nNote: To protect the sheets from light and scratches, wrap them in aluminum foil (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]E).",
    "Note: In the current study, the sheet preservation at 15°C–25°C is limited to three days; thus, the transport should not take a longer time.\nCollecting and rehydrating the FD sperm preserved in plastic sheets\nTiming: 3 min\nSeparate the plastic sheets preserving FD sperm by cutting them with scissors (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1149-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Collection and rehydration of FD sperm\n(A) Sheets are taken out from the freezer and cut into squares.\n(B) The plastic sheet and weighing paper are cut along the dotted lines.\n(C) Sheets are peeled off to expose the FD sperm.\n(D) FD sperm are transferred to 50 μL of distilled water with tweezers and rehydrated.\nCut the sheet (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B) and peel off the weighing paper to expose the FD sperm (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]C).\nPick the FD sperm pellets with tweezers and transfer them into 1.5 mL tubes (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]D). Add 50 μL of sterile distilled water and mix it with a pipette.\nNote: FD sperm can be scraped with tweezers if they are attached to the weighing paper."
