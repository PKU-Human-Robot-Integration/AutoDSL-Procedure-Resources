    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nHuman fibroblasts\nCardiac fibroblasts are an essential cell type of the human heart that not only provide structural support to the cardiomyocytes but are also an important source of paracrine growth factors (Tallquist and Molkentin, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]). Under pathophysiological conditions, FBs become proliferative and synthesize extracellular matrix that result in scar formation and fibrosis (Fu et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Sayed et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). Human FBs can be obtained from commercial vendors (who isolate FBs from human heart tissue) or can be obtained by differentiating human iPSCs (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). The acquisition of human heart tissue is rare and expensive, and thus iPSC-derived FBs pose as an ideal alternative. In this protocol we obtained human FBs from commercial vendor, ScienCell Research Laboratories. They were passaged and maintained as described below. We obtained human iPSC-derived cardiac fibroblasts (iPSC-CFs) from the laboratory of Dr. Joseph Wu following their established protocol (Zhang et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]). Healthy control iPSCs were obtained from Stanford CVI Biobank (https://med.stanford.edu/scvibiobank.html[href=https://med.stanford.edu/scvibiobank.html]) using an Institutional Review Board (IRB)–approved protocol. A brief summary is provided below.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/700-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Obtaining human fibroblasts\n(A) Representative brightfield image of commercially obtained primary human cardiac fibroblasts.\n(B) Representative brightfield image of iPSC-derived human cardiac fibroblasts. Image is of day 21 iPSC-CFs since start of differentiation. Scale bars, 50 μm.\nMaintenance and passaging of human cardiac fibroblasts\nTiming: 1 week\nPrepare a 6-well matrigel coated plate for the recovery of human cardiac fibroblasts. Incubate the plate for 30 min in a 37°C cell culture incubator.\nThaw and quickly recover one cryovial of commercial human fibroblasts in 1-well of the matrigel coated 6-well plate using 2 mL fibroblast medium.\nFollowing 24 h incubation, replace the medium with fresh 2 mL fibroblast medium.\nChange medium every 2 days till confluent.",
    "Once confluent, passage the human fibroblasts 1:6 split by incubating with 1 mL TrypLE per well for 5 min in a 37°C cell culture incubator and plate onto a new 6-well matrigel coated plate to achieve 70%–80% confluency.\nCritical: We recommend a confluency of 70%–80% before starting the transdifferentiation protocol and a confluency of 100% before cryopreserving them.\nPause Point: At this stage of the protocol, the cells can be cryopreserved for future use by resuspending them in Bambanker (freezing medium) and placing in CoolCell® at −80°C for 24 h followed by long-term storage in liquid nitrogen. Commercial human cardiac fibroblasts are usually received from the vendor at passage one and can be expanded for 15 population doublings as per the vendor’s recommendations.\nAlternate method to obtain human cardiac fibroblasts: Differentiation of human iPSCs into human cardiac fibroblasts\nTiming: 3 weeks\nHuman induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have served as an ideal platform to generate patient-specific cardiovascular cells to model human diseases (Sayed et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Sayed and Wu, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]) or assess cardiotoxicity (Sayed et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Stack et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]; Thomas et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]). In this protocol, we used healthy control iPSCs cultured in human iPSC medium (E8 medium) to generate cardiac fibroblasts. We include an overview of the protocol:\nSeed iPSCs in matrigel coated 6-well plate till 80%–85% confluency.\nOnce confluent, initiate the differentiation protocol by replacing the E8 medium with 2 mL RPMI/B27 minus insulin (RPMI/B27-insulin) per well supplemented with 6 μM CHIR99021 for 2 days.\nOn day 2, replace the medium with fresh 2 mL RPMI/B27-insulin per well for 24 h. After the initiation of the protocol, cells are not washed with 1× PBS.\nOn day 3, replace the medium with freshly prepared 2 mL RPMI/B27-insulin per well supplemented with 5 μM IWR-1 for 2 days.",
    "On day 5, replace the medium with fresh 2 mL RPMI/B27-insulin per well for 24 h.\nOn day 6, passage the differentiating cells with 1 mL TrypLE per well and seed them in new matrigel coated 6-well plates (at 1:12 split ratio) in freshly prepared 2 mL Advanced DMEM/GlutaMAX medium per well with 1% FBS supplemented with 5 μM CHIR99021, 2 μM retinoic acid, and 5 μM of Y27632.\nOn day 7, replace the medium with freshly prepared 2 mL Advanced DMEM/GlutaMAX medium per well supplemented with 5 μM CHIR99021 and 2 μM retinoic acid for 2 days.\nOn day 9, replace the medium with fresh 2 mL Advanced DMEM/GlutaMAX medium per well for 2 days.\nOn day 11, passage the cells with 1 mL TrypLE per well and seed them in new matrigel coated 6-well plates (at 1:3 or 1:6 split ratio) in freshly prepared 2 mL Advanced DMEM/GlutaMAX medium per well supplemented with 2 μM SB431542 for 24 h.\nOn day 12, replace the medium with fresh 2 mL Advanced DMEM/GlutaMAX medium per well supplemented with 2 μM SB431542, and change medium till the cells are confluent.\nOn day 14, passage the cells with 1 mL TrypLE per well and seed them in new matrigel coated 10 cm cell culture dish (at 1:3 split ratio or 2 full 6-well plates to one 10 cm dish) in freshly prepared 10 mL fibroblast growth medium supplemented with 20 ng/mL bFGF and 10 μM SB431542.\nOn day 16, replace the medium with fresh 10 mL fibroblast growth medium per dish supplemented with 20 ng/mL bFGF and 10 μM SB431542.\nOn day 18, replace the medium with fresh 10 mL fibroblast growth medium per dish supplemented with 20 ng/mL bFGF and 10 μM SB431542.",
    "By day 20, the resulting cardiac fibroblasts are confluent and can be passaged for transdifferentiation.\nCritical: By day 18, the purity of cardiac fibroblasts differentiated from iPSCs should be >95% (Zhang et al., 2019a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]). However, we recommend checking the purity of iPSC-CFs before initiating their transdifferentiation to ECs by assessing the expression of CF markers such as COL-I, DDR2, and TCF21 via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).\nPause Point: At this stage the iPSC-CFs can be cryopreserved for future use by resuspending them in Bambanker (freezing medium) and placing in CoolCell® at −80°C for 24 h followed by long-term storage in liquid nitrogen.\nTransdifferentiating human fibroblasts to endothelial cells\nTiming: 4 weeks\nActivation of innate immune pathways have been shown to play an important role in nuclear reprogramming (Lee et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Liu et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Liu et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Sayed et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]) and transdifferentiation of one cell type to another (Sayed et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]; Zhou et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]). The protocol described below employs a safe and efficient way to directly differentiate human fibroblasts to endothelial cells without the use of any exogenous transcription factors (Sayed et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]) (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B). Transdifferentiated ECs (iECs) attain an efficiency of 95%–98% by passage 1 and can be cryopreserved for future research purposes.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/700-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

The schematic outlines the time course and treatments of growth factors and small molecules for the transdifferentiation of fibroblasts.\n(B) Representative phase-contrast images of human fibroblasts undergoing transdifferentiation at different time-points (days) using Incucyte® Live-Cell Imaging system. Scale bars, 100 μm.",
    "Note: Human fibroblasts obtained either commercially or derived using human iPSCs should be cultured at least 3–4 days before initiating the transdifferentiating protocol. The protocol was optimized using a 6-well plate.\nOn day 0 (the day before transdifferentiation), prepare 6-well gelatin-coated plates 30 min prior to seeding the human fibroblasts.\nFollowing 30 mins, remove the excess gelatin and seed human fibroblasts in human fibroblast medium at a density of 1 × 105 cells per well of a 6-well plate for 24 h.\nOn day 1, aspirate the spent medium and replace with induction medium (see recipe) containing DMEM/F12 supplemented with 7.5% FBS, 7.5% knockout serum (KSR), and 30 ng/mL poly(I:C).\nTreat cells daily with fresh induction medium (day 2–6).\nOn day 7, switch the induced human fibroblasts over to transdifferentiation medium (see recipe) containing EGM2 medium supplemented with 50 ng/mL vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), 20 ng/mL bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), and 20 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) for 2 days.\nOn day 9, replace the spent medium with fresh transdifferentiation medium for 2 days.\nOn day 11, replace the spent medium with fresh transdifferentiation medium for 2 days.\nOn day 13, replace the spent medium with fresh transdifferentiation medium for 1 day.\nOn day 14, switch the transdifferentiated human fibroblasts over to maintenance medium (see recipe) containing EGM2 medium supplemented with 50 ng/mL VEGF, 20 ng/mL bFGF, and 100 μM 8-bromoadenosine-3’:5’-cyclic monophosphate sodium salt (8-Br-cAMP) for the next 2 weeks, changing medium every 2 days.\nOn day 28, the cells are ready for CD144 MACS sorting.\nCritical: We recommend observing the cells throughout the protocol as distinct morphological changes can be seen, especially after the addition of the transdifferentiation medium (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nCD144 magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS)\nTiming: 3 h",
    "This step sorts the iECs from the transdifferentiation protocol. CD144, also known as VE-Cadherin has been widely used for the isolation of ECs derived from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and iPSCs (Liu et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Sayed et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Sayed et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nAspirate the spent medium and dissociate the cells using 1 mL TrypLE express per well for 10 mins at 37°C.\nPipette the cells repeatedly to ensure single cell suspension and collect the cells in 1 mL basal EGM2 medium to neutralize the TrypLE express.\nStrain the cell suspension through a pre-rinsed 40 μm strainer into a 50 mL conical tube, centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min, and resuspend 1 × 107 cells in 160 μL ice-cold MACS buffer.\nCritical: Pre-rinse the strainer with MACS buffer before use. Typically, one strainer is used for every 6-well plate, however, replace the strainer with a new one if any clogging is observed.\nIncubate the cell suspension with 40 μL of CD144 magnetic microbeads at 4°C for 15 min in dark.\nWash the cells with 1 mL MACS buffer and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min.\nDuring the centrifugation step, setup the LS columns on the magnetic MACS sorting apparatus and pre-rinse the columns with 3 mL MACS buffer.\nCritical: Ensure the cells remain on ice before and after sorting to avoid cell death.\nAfter centrifugation, remove supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet with 1 mL MACS buffer.\nPass the cell suspension through the LS column.\nWash the column with 3 mL MACS buffer, repeating it 3 times to remove unlabeled cells.\nAfter washes, remove the column from the magnetic separator and place on a 15 mL conical tube.",
    "Add 5 mL MACS buffer to the column and firmly push the column plunger to elute CD144+ labeled cells.\nPause Point: CD144+ iECs can be cryopreserved using Bambanker in liquid nitrogen at this stage.\nCritical: Follow the steps listed in the Miltenyi Biotech MACS sorting protocol (https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/macs-cell-separation.html[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/macs-cell-separation.html]). Prewash the LS columns with MACS buffer to ensure removal of any bubbles. When washing the columns, wait till all the previous wash volume has passed through the column before adding the next volume. When plunging the cells from the column ensure steady and even pressure is applied on the column plunger.\nRe-plating iECs\nTiming: 30 min\nCritical: As the yield of transdifferentiated iECs at passage 0 (P0) is ~ 2.5 × 105 cells for each 6-well plate of human fibroblasts, seed the iECs in 1-well of a 6-well plate.\nCentrifuge the CD144+ labeled cells at 300 × g for 5 min. Resuspend the cell pellet in expansion medium (see recipe) containing EGM2 and 10 μM SB431542 and seed the cells in 1-well of a 6-well plate precoated with 0.2% gelatin.\nEnsure cells are evenly dispersed and place them in 37°C incubator.\nMaintaining and passaging iECs\nTiming: up to passage 8\nTransdifferentiated iECs can be maintained with medium changes every 2 days and expanded up to 8 passages (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/700-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Scale bars, 50 μm.\n(B) FACS analysis of cardiac fibroblasts (left panel) and iECs (right panel) with CD31 antibody shows ~96% purity at P1.",
    "(C) Quantitative PCR (qPCR) data of transdifferentiated iECs show expression of EC markers, CD31, CD144, KDR, vWF, and eNOS as relative fold change when compared to human fibroblasts and normalized to GAPDH, a housekeeping gene.

Scale bars, 25 μm.\nOnce 100% confluent, dissociate the P0 iECs with 1 mL TrypLE for 5 min at 37°C. Neutralize the cell suspension with basal EGM2 medium, centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min, and resuspend the cell pellet with expansion medium.\nCritical: Passage P0 iECs on gelatin-coated plates at a 1:3 split ratio.\nCryopreserving iECs\nTiming: 30 mins\nPause Point: Passage 1 (P1) iECs can be cryopreserved for future use.\nAspirate the spent medium from cells and dissociate them with 1 mL TrypLE for 5 min at 37°C. Neutralize the cells with media and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells gently with 1 mL Bambanker.\nTransfer the cell suspension into cryogenic storage vials and place them in CoolCell® freezing container to be placed in −80°C for 24 h.\nTransfer the cryogenic vials to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.\nValidating iECs: Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)\nTiming: 2 h\nOnce the iECs have been expanded they can be characterized and assessed for their purity using FACS (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). CD31, also known as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1), is highly expressed at the intercellular junctions of ECs and plays an important role in maintaining vascular permeability. It is a ubiquitous surface marker of ECs.",
    "Dissociate iECs from gelatin-coated plates with 1 mL TrypLE for 5 min at 37°C. Neutralize TrypLE with media and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet gently in 1× PBS containing 2% FBS at 5 × 105 cells per 100 μL volume per tube.\nIncubate the cells with PE-conjugated antibody against CD31 at 1:400 dilution for 30 min on ice.\nWash cells to remove excess antibody, centrifuge and resuspend in 1× PBS containing 2% FBS.\nRun FACS.\nNote: A FACSAria II cell sorter was used for sorting and data was analyzed using FlowJo 8.7 software (TreeStar).\nValidating iECs: Characterizing gene expression\nTiming: 6 h\nThe gene expression profile of iECs using quantitative PCR can be used to confirm the identity of the transdifferentiated cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). CD31 has been primarily used to demonstrate the presence of ECs. Similarly, CD144, also known as vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) is a marker for ECs (Liu et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Sayed et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nRNA extraction\nDissociate iECs from 1-well of a 6-well plate using 1 mL TrypLE for 5 min at 37°C.
