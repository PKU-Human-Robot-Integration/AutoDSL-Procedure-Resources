    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe following protocol outlines steps for isolating both CD71/CD24low and CD71/CD24high early erythroid progenitor cells from mouse fetal livers extracted from E14.5 pregnant C57BL/6J mice. Two methods for isolation, FACS and immunomagnetic isolation using the EasySep PE Positive Selection Kit II, are described. For both methods, fetal liver cells are isolated from fetuses from E14.5 pregnant mice, and subsequently lineage depleted. Lineage depleted cells are either stained for FACS isolation or immunomagnetic isolation using an EasySep PE Positive Selection Kit II. Isolated CD71/CD24low cells from each method can then be cultured and utilized for downstream applications including growth curve analysis, genomic DNA isolation, or retroviral transduction.\nBefore beginning, prepare ten 50 mL aliquots (500 mL total) of PNEG buffer.\nIsolation of lineage depleted cells\nTiming: 2.5 h\nDescribed here are detailed steps to isolate lineage depleted cells from fetal livers from E14.5 pregnant mice.\nEuthanize E14.5 pregnant mice using CO2 asphyxiation followed by an approved secondary method such as cervical dislocation\nNote: To minimize any cell death after euthanasia is performed, conduct CO2 asphyxiation in a vicinity close to a tissue culture hood, if possible.\nNecropsy mice and place fetuses in a sterile, 10 cm petri dish on ice containing 5–10 mL PNEG. Count the total number of fetuses (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nIn a sterile tissue culture hood, dissect out all fetal livers and place in 50 mL conical tube containing 5 mL PNEG",
    "Note: Two small pairs of forceps are most useful for extracting fetal livers. Gently clamp one pair above the liver and under the arms of the fetus, and gently but with increasing pressure clamp the other pair below the liver at the hips of the fetus. To further facilitate excision of the liver, tilt the two clamped forceps towards one another, angling towards the posterior side of the fetus (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nVigorously create a single cell suspension from the fetal livers using a well-charged 5 mL serological pipette\nUsing a P1000 pipette, apply the cell suspension to a 70 μm filter on top of 50 mL conical\nScrape the filter with the pipette tip to disrupt any clotted tissue\nTake any remaining connective tissue aggregates back into the first conical, add 5 mL PNEG to this conical tube, resuspend this mixture, and reapply to the filter, this time using a 5 mL serological pipette\nRepeat this step until a total of 50 mL of filtered cell suspension is collected in the second conical\nCentrifuge cells at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C and aspirate off the supernatant\nAdd 4 mL Ammonium Chloride solution to lyse red blood cells\nNote: While Ficoll-Pacque separation media can also be used to obtain mononuclear cells, the process for doing so takes significantly longer in this context than conducting RBC lysis, and often requires RBC lysis after Ficoll-Paque separation of cells. Therefore, RBC lysis is our preferred method for mononuclear cell isolation in this protocol.\nIncubate on ice for 6 min, then add PNEG to a total volume of 50 mL\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C and aspirate off the media\nThe pellet should be much whiter this time; if not, repeat the red blood cell lysis",
    "Vigorously resuspend the pellet in 5 mL PNEG using a 5 mL serological pipette\nApply this cell suspension to a 70 μM filter on top of a 50 mL conical\nTake any remaining red cell membrane aggregates (will appear similar in nature to connective tissue from step 6 above) from the filter back into the original 50 mL conical, resuspend vigorously with an additional 5 mL of PNEG, and apply to the same 70 μM filter\nBased on the number of fetuses, add the appropriate amount of Lineage depletion antibody mix to the 10 mL cell suspension. Refer to the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] for the appropriate amount of each lineage depletion antibody to add for the number of fetuses isolated.\nIncubate on ice for 30 min, then add PNEG to a total volume of 50 mL\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C and aspirate off the media\nResuspend the pellet in 2 mL PNEG\nVortex streptavidin magnetic beads for 20 s\nAdd streptavidin magnetic beads to the cells and mix well. For FACS isolation, add 125 μL of streptavidin magnetic beads per 8 fetuses. For immunomagnetic isolation, add 187.5 μL streptavidin magnetic beads per 8 fetuses.\nNote: Isolating CD71/CD24low cells via FACS includes a FITC-lineage gating step when sorting, whereas no such additional lineage removal step exists for the immunomagnetic isolation strategy; therefore, we recommend using 1.5× the amount of streptavidin beads when doing immunomagnetic isolation to ensure purity of lineage depleted cells.\nNote: Vortexing briefly works well for this\nIncubate in a 4°C refrigerator for 20 min. No tapping of the tube is required during incubation.\nDuring this time, set up two 5 mL polypropylene tubes in BD Imag magnetic stand",
    "Briefly mix the cell and bead mixture before adding the mix into the 1st tube on magnetic stand\nIncubate on the magnet in a 4°C refrigerator for 5 min\nCheck that the beads have moved to the magnet side of the tube when the incubation is finished\nCarefully pipette the supernatant into a second polypropylene tube that is on the same magnetic stand\nBe sure not to move the position of the first tube, or the magnetic beads will fall off and contaminate the bead-free supernatant.\nIncubate the magnet in a 4°C refrigerator for 5 min\nCarefully pipette the supernatant into a 15 mL conical and fill to a total volume of 15 mL with PNEG\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C\nResuspend the pellet in 1mL PNEG and keep on ice\nOptional verification step: Count the cells on a hemocytometer\nNote: On average, expect a total of at least 2–3 million lineage depleted cells per 8 fetuses used.\nCritical: To minimize loss of any cells from this rare population, keep cells on ice at all times when not actively manipulating cells.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1.

Dissection of fetal livers from mouse fetuses, related to step 3\nSurface marker staining of lineage depleted cells for both FACS and magnetic isolation\nTiming: 1 h\nThe following steps describe how to stain lineage depleted cells for FACS and immunomagnetic isolation of CD71/CD24low and CD71/CD24high erythroid progenitor cells.\nAdd 200 μL PNEG to each of 6 polypropylene FACS tubes and to each add the following antibody stains:",
    "Main Sample tube: 10 μL APC-CD117 (clone 2B8; [stock]: 0.5 mg/mL; [working]: 5 μg/mL), 3 μL PE-CD71 (clone R127217; [stock]: 0.2 mg/mL; [working]: 0.6 μg/mL), 3 μL PE-CD24 (clone M1/69; [stock]: 0.2 mg/mL; [working]: 0.6 μg/mL), and 2 μL FITC-streptavidin ([stock]: 0.5 mg/mL; [working]: 1 μg/mL)\nTubes ultimately used for compensation controls:\nPropidium Iodide (PI) single stain tube: no stain added yet at this step\nFITC single stain tube: 0.5 μL FITC-streptavidin ([working]: 1.25 μg/mL)\nAPC single stain tube: 2 μL APC-CD117 (clone 2B8; [working]: 5 μg/mL)\nPE single stain tube: 0.7 μL PE-CD71 (clone R127217; [working]: 0.7 μg/mL) and 0.7 μL PE-CD24 (clone M1/69; [working]: 0.7 μg/mL)\nUnstained control tube: no stain needs to be added to unstained control\nAdd 10 μL lineage depleted cells to each compensation control tube.\nNote: Lineage depleted cells are used to set up voltages during compensation so that voltages and gating are most accurate for this particular cell type. We have observed that some of these markers (in particular CD117, CD71, and CD24) have much higher surface expression density than any other surface markers that can be commonly used for staining compensation controls (e.g. anti-B220 staining of splenocytes). Thus, in order to correctly compensate for the high fluorescence intensities in our system, we must use single stains of the actual lineage depleted fetal liver cells.\nNote: Add 20 μL lineage depleted cells to each single-stain tube if only 1–2 pregnant mice are used.\nAdd the rest of the cells to Main Sample tube\nVortex all tubes and incubate on ice and in the dark for 20 min\nDuring this incubation, prepare 1× PI solution by adding 2 μL PI (1 mg/mL) to 2 mL PNEG and leave on ice until use",
    "During this incubation, also aliquot 2 mL PNEG into 15 mL conical tubes labeled with either CD71/CD24low or CD71/CD24high for FACS collection\nAfter the incubation, fill FACS tubes to near top with PNEG to wash\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C and pour off the supernatant\nNote: Gently pour off the supernatant rather than aspirate so as to not risk losing any cells. When pouring off the supernatant, pour in one swift and gentle motion and do not shake the tube so as to not dislodge the pellet.\nResuspend all samples, except for the PI single stain and Main Sample, in 200 μL PNEG\nResuspend the Main Sample in 1000 μL 1× PI solution and PI single stain sample in 200 μL 1× PI solution\nNote: Isolate cells by sorting or immunomagnetic purification purify as soon as possible after surface marker staining is complete. Cells can be left for a maximum 3–4 h after surface marker staining is completed, but the longer the elapsed time, the higher the percentage of dead cells is observed, and thus a lower cell yield.\nFACS isolation of CD71/CD24low and CD71/CD24high erythroid progenitor cells\nTiming: 1.5 h\nNote: FACS for this protocol has always been conducted on a BD FACSAria using an 85 μm nozzle.\nSet the voltages for each stain (APC, FITC, PE, and PI) using unstained and single-stain controls.\nSet gates to exclude cell fragments and multicellular aggregates and include only forward-scatter (FSC) singlets, side-scatter (SSC) singlets, live (PI negative) cells, and lineage-negative (FITC negative) cells.\nWhen running the Main Sample, plot PE (CD24&CD71) versus APC (c-Kit) and gate on CD117-high and CD24&CD71-low cells that make up 10% of the population to isolate CD71/CD24low erythroid progenitors (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1331-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. CD71/CD24low and CD71/CD24high FACS sorting schematic",
    "To isolate CD71/CD24high progenitors, gate on CD117-high and CD24&CD71-high cells that make up 20% of the population.\nNote: For optimal sorting results, an 85 μm nozzle and a flow rate of 1.5 should be used.\nCritical: Given the sensitivity of liver cells, once removed from mice, cells should be sorted into PNEG buffer and kept on ice or at 4°C whenever possible to ensure that the appropriate conditions and nutrients for short-term cell survival are maintained.\nImmunomagnetic isolation of CD71/CD24low\nTiming: 1.5 h\nIf a FACS facility is not easily accessible, CD71/CD24low progenitor cells can be isolated using the EasySep PE Positive Selection Kit II. Following surface marker staining, lineage depleted cells are stained with anti-PE antibodies. CD71/CD24low cells exhibit low expression of CD24 and CD71, and therefore can be isolated by depleting cells stained with PE.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1331-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Flow chart depicting the protocol for magnetic isolation of CD71/CD24low erythroid progenitor cells\nAll illustrations created with BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com].\nNote: If isolating cells using both FACS and immunomagnetic isolation methods on the same day, a good tip is to conduct the magnetic isolation protocol during the sort, as both take about 1.5 h. This is only possible, however, if two different people are available to carry out each protocol.\nNote: Reference Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] as a helpful guide for this protocol.\nCentrifuge the Main Sample cells at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C\nCount cells on a hemocytometer\nIf less than 10,000,000 cells total, resuspend cells in 100 μL PNEG\nIf more than 10,000,000 cells, resuspend in a volume of PNEG to make a final concentration of 100,000,000 cells/mL\nAdd 100 μL of EasySep PE Selection Cocktail to sample per mL of resuspended cells\nNote: If <10,000,000 cells total, add 10 μL EasySep PE Selection Cocktail",
    "Incubate mixture at 4°C for 15 min. No tapping of the tube is required during the incubation.\nVortex EasySep RapidSpheres for 30 s, then add 50 μL /mL of sample\nNote: If <10,000,000 cells total, add 5 μL EasySep RapidSpheres\nIncubate at 4°C for 10 min\nAdd 1.25 mL PNEG to the sample and mix gently by pipetting up and down 2–3 times\nCritical: Before every magnetic incubation, thoroughly wash the sides of the tube with the PNEG that was added to the sample, and briefly mix the solution by pipetting to get all cells in solution and to break up any cell-bead clumps.\nIncubate solution in the EasySep magnet at 4°C in a refrigerator for 5 min\nNote: This is the first out of six magnet incubation steps. It is a good idea to mark down each step so that one does not lose track.\nPour off the supernatant into a new polystyrene tube and label “magnet CD71/CD24low 1”\nNote: Keep all cell samples, such as the “magnet CD71/CD24low 1” sample, on ice whenever not in direct use.\nThoroughly wash the bead-bound fraction in the first tube with 1.25 mL PNEG\nIncubate the bead-bound fraction in the EasySep magnet at 4°C in a refrigerator for 5 min\nNote: This is the second out of six CD71/CD24low magnet incubation steps.\nPour off the supernatant into the “magnet CD71/CD24low 1” tube\nIncubate the “magnet CD71/CD24low 1” tube in EasySep magnet for 5 min at 4°C in a refrigerator\nNote: This is the third out of six CD71/CD24low magnet incubation steps.\nPour off supernatant and label a new polystyrene tube “magnet CD71/CD24low 2”\nWash the bead-bound fraction with 1.25 mL PNEG\nIncubate this fraction in the EasySep magnet at 4°C for 5 min in a refrigerator",
    "Note: This is the fourth out of six CD71/CD24low magnet incubation steps.\nNote: There should be a total volume of 3.75 mL in the polystyrene tube at this point. A maximum of 3 mL can be used for each magnetic incubation, which is why the cells must be pelleted in the next step before another magnetic incubation.\nCentrifuge “magnet CD71/CD24low 2” at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C\nCarefully pour off the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1.25 mL PNEG\nNote: When pouring off the supernatant, pour in one gentle motion so as to not dislodge the cell pellet.\nIncubate the “magnet CD71/CD24low 2” tube in EasySep magnet at 4°C for 5 min in a refrigerator\nNote: This is the fifth out of six CD71/CD24low magnet incubation steps.\nPour off the supernatant into a new tube labeled “magnet CD71/CD24low 3”\nWash the bead-bound fraction with 1.25 mL PNEG\nIncubate the bead-bound fraction in the EasySep magnet at 4°C for 5 min in a refrigerator\nNote: This is the sixth and final CD71/CD24low magnet incubation step.\nPour off the supernatant into the “magnet CD71/CD24low 3” tube\nNote: This is the final sample of magnetically-isolated CD71/CD24low cells. The total volume of the sample should be 2.5 mL.\nOptional verification step: Save a small amount of the Main Sample and of the “magnet CD71/CD24low 3” sample (minimum of 10,000 cells each) and conduct flow cytometry using the same gating strategy as specified in the FACS isolation of CD71/CD24low and CD71/CD24high cells section. Ideally, the cells should fall within the CD71/CD24low gate.\nCulturing CD71/CD24low and CD71/CD24high for growth curves\nTiming: 10 days\nPellet FACS- or immunomagnetically-isolated CD71/CD24low and CD71/CD24high cells at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C and aspirate off the supernatant",
    "Resuspend cells in 100 μL PNEG and keep on ice\nCount cells on a hemocytometer\nAdd 1 mL Serum-free erythroid liquid expansion media per well of a 24-well plate. Seed the appropriate number of cells in each well.\nNote: We perform 3 technical replicates (3 wells) per treatment condition and seed 10,000 cells per well. Two treatments, using Dex-supplemented and Dex-free Serum free erythroid liquid expansion media, were used for our growth curves.\nNote: Refer to materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] for Serum-free erythroid liquid expansion media recipe.\nIncubate cells at 37°C and 5% CO2\nIf conducting a growth curve, count cells on days 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and 10 after seeding. Refer to Tables 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] for examples of calculating expansion per single cell from raw cell counts.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1331_4.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1331_5.csv\nNote: From the raw cell count data (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]), the average number of cells for each biological replicate was generated (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]). To generate scaled averages, which accounts for re-seeding cells at 50,000 cells per well on days 3 and 6 after initial seeding, cell count averages on days 6, 8, and 10 were divided by the number of cells re-seeded (50,000 cells) and multiplied by the most recent scaled average value before re-seeding (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]). Average expansion per single cell was calculated by dividing each scaled average by the number of cells seeded on day 0 (10,000 cells).\nCritical: Re-seed cells at 50,000 cells per well on days 3 and 6.\nCritical: For each biological replicate, use the same stock solution of Serum-free erythroid liquid expansion media (with the appropriate 100 nM Dex or methanol supplements) for all replicates."
