    "NOTE: A schematic of the overall protocol described here is given in Figure 1. All samples used for the development of this method are surplus clinical diagnostic samples and have ethical approval from the London Bloomsbury Ethics committee.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54541/54541fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic Illustrating the Overall Process of Creating a Targeted CSF MRM LC-MS/MS Assay. Candidate marker peptides for evaluation are selected from protein targets. Through the use of custom synthesized peptides, a targeted LC-MS/MS multiplex method is created. After evaluation, the assay can be used to assess the efficacy of potential markers of neurodegeneration.\n1. Peptide Selection and Design\nNOTE: Criteria for a marker peptide is that it must be unique (proteotypic) and representing the quantitative abundance of the protein (quantotypic). To determine if a peptide is unique or not, the 'blast' search tool on the Uniprot website (http://www.uniprot.org/blast/) can be used.\nDefine a list of target proteins (markers), i.e., ApoE (see Table 2).\n\tNOTE: If the marker has been identified from previous proteomic profiling experiments8, then select the peptide that gives the best response from that data set.\nIf this information is unavailable, use open source websites, such as in silico trypsin digestion of target proteins, using a software tool such as MS-Digest.\nChoose the peptide which is tryptic and not susceptible to post translational modifications.\n\tNOTE: This information can be checked on the Uniprot website www.uniprot.org. Avoid peptides prone to chemical modification during LC-MS sample preparation.\nOrder the custom synthesis of the chosen peptides.",
    "NOTE: Marker peptides can be custom synthesized by various commercial companies. For ApoE the quantotypic peptide used to measure total ApoE levels was determined to be AATVGSLAGQPLQER. The proteotypic peptide sequences used to determine the E2 and E4 variants are the tryptic peptides for position 158 (RLAVYQAGAR and CLAVYQAGAR) and position 112  (LGADMEDVCGR and LGADMEDVR), respectively.\n2. Preparation of Standard Peptides\nNOTE: In order to select the best quantitative transitions, the detection of the matrix (CSF) needs to  be optimized. The most efficient way of optimizing multiplexed peptides is to create pools of the peptides at known concentrations. These pools can then be used for method development and standard curves.\nResuspend synthetic peptides (peptide details are given in Table 2) to 1 mg/ml stock concentration according to manufactures instructions. By default, if instructions are not available, resuspend peptides in 50:50 (v/v) acetonitrile (ACN)/H2O.\nPrepare the 1:10 dilutions of the peptide from the stock concentration and pool 1,000 pmol of each peptide into a low binding microcentrifuge tube. Dry down in a speed-vac concentrator the final pool and store at -20 °C. Prepare several pools for future use.\nAliquot 100 µl of CSF into low binding tubes. Freeze-dry the CSF.\nResuspend an aliquot of pooled 1,000 pmol peptides in digestion buffer (100 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.8, 6 M Urea, 2 M Thiourea, 2% ASB14) to obtain concentrations of 10 and 1 pmol/µl.\nSpike the pooled peptides into the freeze-dried 100 µl aliquots of CSF at 0, 1, 2, 5, 10 and 15 pM concentrations. Add 20 ng of intact unrelated protein such as yeast enolase to act as an internal standard and control for digestion efficiency of trypsin.\nTop up the CSF aliquots with digest buffer to a final amount of 20 µl. Vortex.",
    "Add 1.5 µl of dithiothreitol (30 mg in 1 ml of 100 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.8) and shake at room temperature for 1 hr.\nAdd 3 µl of iodoacetamide (35 mg in 1 ml of 100 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.8) and shake at room temperature for 45 min in the dark.\nAdd 165 µl of ddH2O.\nAdd 10 µl of 0.1 µg/µl sequencing grade modified trypsin solution resuspended in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.8. Incubate in a water bath at 37 °C O/N and stop the digestion by freezing samples. Store digests at -20 °C until ready to analyze.\n3. Optimization of MS Peptide Detection\nCopy and paste the sequence of the peptide to be optimized, into an appropriate software, e.g., Skyline9. Click on the peptide sequence to obtain the information of expected precursor ion mass and product ions.\nDilute the peptides from stock concentration (see section 2.1) further to 1 ng/ml concentration for MS method development.\nDirectly infuse the peptides in the mass spectrometer at optimized flow rate (usually 0.1 - 0.8 ml/min) and with 0 - 5% collision energy.\nAcquire MS spectrum in order to identify the experimental multiply charged precursor ions8. Choose the precursor ion (m/z) that gives the most intensity (doubly- or triply-charged precursor ions are advised).\nReinfuse the peptide and apply collision energy to fragment the peptide by collision-induced-dissociation (CID). Optimize the cone and collision energies to obtain the best fragmentation pattern (fragment ions singly or doubly charged, and mass of fragment ion preferably bigger than parent ion, are advised).",
    "Verify that the experimentally obtained transitions match transitions generated in silico (as described in step 3.1). Save the transition list in the MRM method file using at least 2 most intense transitions per precursor ion. Include 2 transitions: 1 for quantitation and 1 for confirmation in the final assay.\n\tNOTE: Some MS manufacturers have a function (i.e., Waters Intellistart) for automated MRM or SRM analysis optimization. If possible infuse peptides with combined mobile phases at 50 - 70% ACN with 0.1% FA.\n4. LC-MRM Method Development\nNOTE: Analyze the mixture of synthetic peptides by an Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) system coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Ensure the source is clean. Solvent A is ddH20 with 0.1% FA; Solvent B is ACN with 0.1% FA.\nUse the LC-MS system equipped with a UPLC column packed with C-18 phase (1.6 µm diameter, 90 Å pores, 2.1 mm x 50 mm length) and attached to a pre-column of the same phase.\nDefrost CSF digests on ice, centrifuge at 16,000 g for 10 min and transfer 60 µl into 300 µl glass insert vials and store the rest back at -20oC.\nInject the highest concentration from standard curve point using 10 min 1 - 40% ACN linear gradient (see Table 1 for gradient settings)\nOpen the resulting chromatogram and note retention time and top two most intense (quantitative) transitions per peptide with all transitions created in step 3.\nBased on this information, update a 10 min MRM method (created in step 3.6) with timed channels to measure peptides (see Figure 2 for an example). To maintain sensitivity, keep each channel with points per peak greater than 8 and dwell time greater than 0.01 sec for at least one transition for each peptide.",
    "Include 'solvent delays' in the MRM method: one at the beginning until 10 sec before the first peak elution and another at the end of the method, 20 sec after the last peak elution. Do this by selecting \"solvent delays\" in method events in MS method file.\nRun the standard curve through the timed MRM method and ensure there are no interfering nonspecific peaks with transitions (generated in step 3.6) by checking for linearity.\nDetermine if the peptides are detectable by running non-spiked pooled control and disease CSF through the method.\nRemove the peptides that are below the limit of detection from the assay.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54541/54541fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Example of a Dynamic MRM MS Method. Timed channels of peptide transitions can be grouped according to established retention times. Enabling MRMs to be incorporated into a timed fashion as the selected marker peptides elute from the chromatography column, minimizes the number of transitions over a time period and increases the sensitivity of the assay.

Addition of Internal Standards\nNOTE: As described previously10, stable isotope-labeled internal standards can be included in the assay. Due to the expense of these standards, it is advised to first assess the peptides in the matrix.\nDetermine the ideal peptides optimized for detection in CSF: choose the peptides which are the most recurrent, with the highest intensity and without interference peaks.\nDesign corresponding peptides to include heavy 13C 15N amino acid labels that increase the mass of the peptide by at least 6 Da relative to endogenous peptide. Also, add a tag of 4 - 6 additional amino acids to either the N- or C-terminus of the heavy peptide to control for tryptic digestion.",
    "Dilute stable isotope-labeled internal standards in digestion buffer (see step 2.4). Determine the ideal amount of stable isotope-labeled internal standard which will be spiked in CSF by spiking in various levels depending on the abundancies previously observed during development. Aim to achieve approximately 1:1 ratio of stable isotope-labeled standard to endogenous peptide.\n\tNOTE: Stable isotope-labeled internal standards can be synthesized by various commercial companies.\n6. LC-MRM Assay of CSF Patient Samples\nSpike optimized amount of stable isotope-labeled standards into 100 µl of CSF and freeze-dry the mixture.\nResuspend the CSF in 20 µl of digest buffer and perform the digestion as described in points 2.7 - 2.10.\nAnalyze the samples using LC-MRM method developed in step 4.\nFor quantitative analysis, run the standard peptides in concentrations of 0 -15 pmol in a standard curve. See step 2.5 for the preparation of standard curve.\n7. Data Analysis\nNOTE: Quantitative data is based on the intensity ratio of baseline peak internal standards (heavy labeled peptides). Detailed information regarding SRM/MRM data analysis was previously described10. Ratio data can then be used in a standard curve to determine absolute levels or calculate them from the added concentration of heavy-labeled peptide.\nAnalyze LC-MRM data using the mass spectrometers manufacturers' standard software10. Alternatively, use Skyline software to analyze quantitative MRM data10.\nCheck the sensitivity of the run by checking the response of an internal standard such as the spiked yeast enolase or a stable isotope-labeled standard in each run. Ensure that the coefficient of variation (CV) is not larger than 25%.\nManually review the data annotation to ensure accuracy. Analyze each peptide and ratio to an appropriate stable isotope-labeled internal standard, i.e., use the stable isotope-labeled version of the peptide if available.",
    "To obtain absolute values of pmol per 100 µl of CSF, run the ratio data through appropriate standard curves that were run at the same time.\nCalculate the coefficient of variation (CV). CV for each peptide should be below 25% and below 15% for high abundant peptides.\n\tNOTE: Absolute value pmol per 100 µl CSF values can used in subsequent downstream statistical analysis.\n8. Apolipoprotein E Isoform Status\nNOTE: To determine ApoE isoform status, the presence of the corresponding peptides can be performed by determining the presence of each isoform.\nConsider the ApoE in 100 µl of CSF threshold of > 1,000 signal-to-noise as positive for that peptide. See Figure 5 for the peptides required/absent to determine a patient's isoform status. Determine the allelic expression by calculating the % of each isoform to total ApoE expression. \nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
