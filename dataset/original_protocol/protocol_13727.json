    "The experiments were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at Innsbruck Medical University and by the Austrian ministry of science (BMWF-66.011/0110-V/3b/2019).\n1. Induction of anesthesia and operational set-up\nPrepare a suitable environment for animal procedures: sterilize equipment, disinfect surfaces, make use of disposable masks, isolation gowns and gloves.\nSedate a 18-12-weeks old mouse (strain and sex depending on the experimental setting) in a chamber attached to an isoflurane vaporizer at 4%.\nCheck for the sufficient sedation via pedal or pinna reflex as indicators for deep pain recognition.\nWhen the animal is sufficiently sedated, turn off isoflurane flow and administer analgesia and anesthetics as per the approved animal care and use protocol use e.g., ketamine hydrochloride (80 mg/kg body weight) as an anesthetic and xylazine hydrochloride (5 mg/kg body weight) as an analgetic intra-peritoneally.\n\tNOTE: Prepare syringe with intra-peritoneal medication before placing the animal in anesthesia chamber.\nExamine the depth of anesthesia 5 min after injection by assessing the pedal withdrawal reflex.\nApply eye ointment (e.g., 0.5 g Retinolpalmitat) to avoid corneal damage.\nRemove hair in and in the proximity to the surgical area, in particular the left hind limb and groin. Depilatory cream can be used instead of razors or trimmers to avoid skin injury.\nFixate the animal in a supine position with extended limbs on a heating plate using adhesive tape.\nDisinfect and clean the area of surgery with 10% povidone-iodine or similar disinfectant. Use sterile field drape.\n2. Procedure\nUse a microscope between 10x and 20x magnification to perform the surgery.\nMake a skin incision (~1.5 cm) proximal to the knee joint using surgical scissors.\nGently separate the skin from underlying tissue using blunt forceps.\nIdentify the femoral vessels. Carefully separate artery, vein, and nerve using forceps and scissors.",
    "Starting proximally at the level of the inguinal ligament, carefully remove the surrounding connective tissue until the artery is optimally displayed. As a distal endpoint, the arterial branching into the saphenous and popliteal artery should be visible.\nLigate the proximal femoral artery at the level of the inguinal ligament using a 7-0 polypropylene suture.\nOcclude the distal end of the femoral artery proximal to the branching into saphenous and popliteal artery using a 7-0 polypropylene suture.\nExcise the femoral artery segment between the distal and proximal knots using the diathermy.\n\tNOTE: Excising the femoral artery by cutting with surgical scissor is also possible. However, using a diathermy occludes the vessel in addition to the suture in case the knots fail.\nMake sure the femoral artery is safely occluded and no bleedings are visible in the field of operation.\n\tNOTE: Narrow distance between skin sutures is recommended to avoid ultrasonic gel decontamination of the wound during SWT application.\nSuture the skin incision using 5-0 non-absorbable nylon sutures with single knots.\nDisinfect the surgical area with cotton swabs.\n3. Shockwave therapy application\nMake sure skin incision is fully closed.\nDefine treatment parameters at shockwave device. In this experimental setting, an energy flux density of 0.1 mJ/mm2 at a frequency of 3 Hz for a total of 300 impulses was used.\n\tNOTE: The energy levels were adopted from previous results14 utilizing focused extracorporeal shockwave treatment.\nApply ultrasonic gel to the treatment area on the inner thigh for proper coupling.\nMake sure no air bubbles are trapped within the gel.\n\tNOTE: Proper coupling with enough gel is essential for adequate SWT application. Small air bubbles within the gel will absorb shockwaves and decrease their effect.\nApply 300 impulses by toggling the foot switch while slowly moving the applicator over the thigh.",
    "NOTE: If SWT is not applied immediately after surgery, avoid possible shockwave energy absorption due to re-grown hair by removal prior to treatment.\nAfter treatment, wipe off any residual ultrasonic gel to prevent cooling of the thigh.\nMove the animal into a recovery cage exposed to a heating lamp to avoid hypothermia.\nMonitor the animal carefully until awake and administer a dose of 0.05 mg/kg body weight of buprenorphine, subcutaneously for adequate analgesia.\nMonitor the health and wellbeing of animals daily until the surgical incision is healed fully.\n\tâ€‹NOTE: Treatment can be limited to one session or be repeated multiple times. In this example, a single application was performed.\n4. Blood flow measurement\nPerform blood flow measurement immediately after surgery and at various timepoints afterwards depending on the experimental setting.\nSedate the animal in a chamber attached to an isoflurane vaporizer at 4%.\nWhen the animal is sedated, turn off isoflurane flow and administer anesthetics and analgesics. As per the approved animal care and use protocol apply ketamine hydrochloride (80 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine hydrochloride (5 mg/kg body weight) intra-peritoneally.\nExamine the depth of anesthesia 5 min after the injection by assessing the pedal withdrawal reflex.\nUtilize eye ointment (e.g., 0.5 g Retinolpalmitat) to avoid corneal damage.\nFixate the animal in a supine position with extended limbs on a heating plate using adhesive tape.\nRemove hair from both hind limbs meticulously.\nMeasure limb perfusion via laser doppler according to manufacturer's instruction.\n\tNOTE: The ratio of ischemic limb versus non-ischemic limb blood flow should be used as the prime parameter.\nSubscription Required.
