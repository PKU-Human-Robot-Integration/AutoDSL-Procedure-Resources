    "The study protocol conforms to the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the institutional review board and ethics committee of Charité Medical University. All patients provided written, informed consent for use of heart tissue for experimental studies.\n1. Preparation of Human Myocardium for Sectioning\nObtain left ventricular myocardium (size varies depending on the type of surgery) directly from the operating room and transport in cold PBS in a sterile container.\nRemove all fat tissue with a sterile scalpel with a no. 10 blade under sterile conditions.\nCut the myocardium in cubes of approximately 1 x 1 x 1 cm using a scalpel.\nPlace the cubes in sterile 50 mL tubes.\n\tNOTE: To pause, perform step 1.5, otherwise continue with step 2.2. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles to prevent protein degradation and a decrease in tissue quality.\nStore the tubes containing the cubes at -80 °C. The tissue can be stored for several months.\n2. Sectioning of the Myocardium Cubes into Slices\nTake the tube(s) containing the prepared cubes out of the freezer.\nTransport on ice to the cryostat.\nSet the object and chamber temperature to -15 °C.\n\tNOTE: The right temperature is crucial to guarantee perfect sectioning.\nChill empty 50 mL tubes and stamps in the chamber or on dry ice.\nAdd a layer (approximately 0.5 - 1.0 mL) of cryosection medium onto the cold stamp and let it freeze until it is white and solid.\nAdd a second layer of cryosection medium and place a myocardium cube onto this layer.\nMake sure the cryosection medium and myocardium are completely frozen before you continue.",
    "NOTE: When the sample and cryosection medium are not frozen the sectioning will be impaired. Completely frozen cryosection medium turns from fluid and transparent to solid, white, and non-transparent. The myocardial cubes need at least 30 min up to 1 h to completely freeze if continuing immediately from step 1.4. When the tissue is frozen it should not deform when touched/handled with tweezers.\nInsert stamp with frozen myocardium into the holder and tighten all screws.\nTrim the surface of the tissue until an even sectioning surface is obtained.\nSet sectioning thickness to 300 µm.\nSection the frozen myocardium with automatic sectioning. This guarantees uniform cut sections. Approximately 30 - 40 sections can be sliced from one cube.\nPlace each slice after sectioning loosely in a precooled 50 mL tube.\n\tNOTE: Do not press the slices or pack tightly. Approximately 40 slices can fit in one tube.\nClose the filled tubes and place on ice.\n\tNOTE: To pause go on with step 2.14, otherwise continue with step 3.2.\nStore myocardium slices at -80 °C. The slices can be stored for several months.\n3. Decellularization of Human Myocardium Slices\nTake the necessary number of 50 mL tubes containing myocardium sections out of the -80 °C freezer and transport on ice.\nTransfer the frozen sections of all 50 mL tubes from step 3.1 into one sterile beaker. Approximately 40 slices are added to the beaker per 50 mL tube. The beaker should be three times the volume of the 50 mL tubes; for example, for decellularization of one 50 mL tube use a 150 mL beaker.\nAdd 50 mL lysis solution (10 mM Tris, 0.1% w/v EDTA, pH 7.4 in H2O) per 50 mL tube with myocardium slices.",
    "Shake the myocardium slices in a sterile beaker at 100 - 150 rpm continuously for 2 h at room temperature.\nStrain the liquid with the tissue slices through a coarse strainer. Transfer the tissue slices with a blunt tweezer to a new sterile beaker. Add 50 mL of 0.5% SDS in PBS per initial 50 mL tube of myocardium slices (e.g., use 100 mL SDS solution when two 50 mL tubes of myocardial sections are being decellularized).\nShake continuously for 6 h at 100 - 150 rpm at room temperature.\nStrain the liquid with the tissue slices through a coarse strainer. Transfer the tissue slices with a blunt tweezer to a new sterile beaker and wash 3 times with 50 mL PBS for 10 min each while shaking at 150 rpm. Next, wash overnight in PBS with 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin and 1% Nystatin (PBS-P/S-N) at 100-150 rpm and 4 °C while shaking.\n\tNOTE: Thorough washing is crucial to completely remove any residual SDS. Remaining traces of SDS are toxic when the ECM is used in combination with cells.\nRemove the washing solution and add 25 mL preheated FBS (37 °C) with 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin and 1% Nystatin to the decellularized slices per initial 50 mL tube of myocardium slices.\nIncubate for 3 h at 37 °C. In this step, any remaining DNA is removed from the matrix due to the intrinsic DNase activity of the FBS.\nTransfer the slices to a new sterile beaker and wash 3 times with 50 mL PBS for 10 min each while shaking at 150 rpm.\n\tNOTE: The ECM slices can be stored in PBS-P/S-N at 4 °C for several days. However, it is recommended to proceed immediately.\n4. Processing the Decellularized cECM to a Powder",
    "Place the ECM slices loosely in a new sterile 6-well plate. Freeze the ECM at -80 °C and lyophilize for 2 days in a lyophilizer.\n\tNOTE: More than one slice can be placed per well. Arrange the slices to completely cover the surface of the well. Overlapping the slices does not affect the subsequent pulverization success.\nFor the pulverization of the ECM slice, use specific milling tubes (see Table of Materials) containing 1.4 mm ceramic beads.Fill the tubes loosely with lyophilized ECM using sterile blunt tweezers. For optimal results, a total weight of ECM between 10 - 20 mg is recommended.\n\tNOTE: If the ECM is packed too tightly in the milling tubes the pulverization process will be negatively affected.\nSnap-freeze the tubes in liquid nitrogen.\n\tCAUTION: Liquid nitrogen is extremely low temperature, wear appropriate personal protection.\nInsert the frozen tubes into the milling machine and pulverize the ECM.\nSet a duration of 30 s and a maximum speed and start the device.\nAfter finishing, take out the tubes and snap-freeze again in liquid nitrogen.\nRepeat five times.\nWash the microparticles from the tubes by adding 1 mL ddH2O per tube and shake or vortex for complete solubilizing. Filter the heterogeneous solution through a 200 µm mesh into a 50 mL tube.\nFreeze the tube in -80 °C or liquid nitrogen.\nReplace the standard lid of the tube with a 0.22 µm filter. This filter lid prevents the powder from flowing out of the tube but allows air circulation for water evaporation.\nInsert the tubes in the lyophilizer and lyophilize again to remove the water from the step (step 4.5)\n\tNOTE: Lyophilization at this step can take up to 3 days.\nStore powder at -80 °C until further processing or continue with step 5.1.",
    "5. Enzyme Based Homogenizing of cECM Micro-Particles\nDissolve porcine pepsin in 0.01M HCl (pH 2.0) to a concentration of 1 mg/mL. Place on a rotary shaker at room temperature until it is completely dissolved.\nDissolve the lyophilized human ECM powder (Step 4.8) in the pepsin solution to a final concentration of 10 mg/mL. Mix thoroughly through pipetting. The total volume depends on the amount of ECM solution needed. For example, dissolve 10 mg of ECM powder in 1 mL pepsin solution.\n\tNOTE: Dissolving particles can be supported through gentle vortexing (1,000 - 1,500 RPM). Remaining lumps of microparticles will negatively affect the digestion.\nTransfer the solution to 2 mL tubes with a volume of 1 mL per tube.\nPlace the tubes in a tube shaker for 48 h at 27 °C and 1,200 rpm.\nTake the tubes out of the shaker and place on ice or a pre-cooled tube holder.\nMix 1/9 of the volume of ECM solution of cold 10x PBS (pH 7.4) with 1/10 of the volume of ECM solution of cold 0.1M NaOH in a precooled tube and place on ice. This mixture will neutralize the digested ECM solution and irreversibly inactivate the pepsin.\nAdd the ECM solution to the neutralization mixture and mix thoroughly through pipetting or vortexing.\nSet the ECM to the desired concentration with 1x PBS (pH 7.4). The pH of the solution can be checked with pH paper.\n\tNOTE: Example calculation for 10 mL digested ECM solution:\n\tAdd 10 mg porcine pepsin to 10 mL HCl (pH 2.0).\n\tAdd 100 mg ECM powder to pepsin solution.\n\tNOTE: Example calculation for neutralizing 10 mL digested ECM solution and setting the concentration to 8 mg/mL:\n\tVolFinal = cstart x Volstart / cFinal = 10 mg/mL x 10 mL / 8 mg/mL = 12.5 mL",
    "Vol10xPBS = Volstart / 9 = 1/9 from 10 mL = 1.11 mL 10x PBS\n\tVolNaOH = Volstart / 10 = 1/10 from 10 mL = 1 mL\n\tVol1xPBS = VolFinal - Volstart - Vol10xPBS - VolNaOH = 12.5 mL - 10 mL - .11 mL - 1 mL = 0.39 mL\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
