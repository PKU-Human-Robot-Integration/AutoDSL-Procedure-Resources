Schematic representation of a volatile collection device",
    "In step 1, connect the Teflon tubes to an activated charcoal filter and a Super Q adsorption filter, and the length of the Teflon tubes is determined according to the actual conditions. In step 2, connect the Teflon tubes prepared in step 1 to the glass chamber (20 cm in height and 10 cm in bottom diameter) and the air sampling instrument. In step 3, the mice (or other animals) are anesthetized and placed into the glass chamber, and the glass chambers are tightly sealed with metal caps. In step 4, air purified through an activated charcoal filter and then pump through the chamber at a flow rate of 1 L/min by air sampling instruments. Volatiles released from mice (or other animals) are absorbed by the Super Q 80/100 mesh.\nPurify the air through an activated charcoal filter.\nPump the clean air through the chamber at a flow rate of 1 L/min by a vacuum pump.\nCollect the volatiles released from healthy or DENV2/ZIKV-infected mice in a glass tube containing 100 mg of Super Q 80/100 mesh (GEEQ-008613, CNW).\nUse healthy mice and mice infected with DENV2/ZIKV for 4 and 6 days for volatile collection. Three time periods should be used for volatile collection every day: daytime (lights on, 9:00–11:00 AM, 3:00–5:00 PM) and nighttime (lights off, 7:00–11:00 PM).\nExtract the collected volatile compounds by 600 μL of n-hexane (1.00795, Sigma‒Aldrich) and store at −80°C.\nNote: To avoid interference of feces and urine with volatile collection, AG6 mice are anesthetized with 0.75% pentobarbital (P3761, Sigma‒Aldrich) in glass chambers.\nNote: To avoid environmental effects, cage the healthy and DENV2/ZIKV-infected mice together between experiments.\nCollection of volatiles from dengue patients and healthy donors\nTiming: Variable",
    "This procedure aims to provide detailed steps for collecting volatiles from dengue patients and healthy donors (or other individuals not eligible for collecting volatiles with the device shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nClinically diagnose the dengue patients from outpatient services with an immune colloidal gold kit against DENV nonstructural protein-1 (NS1) antigen.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] Record the age and gender information of dengue patients and healthy donors.\nUse a PDMS Twister with a 1-cm-long/1-mm phase thickness in the human volatile collection steps. Before usage, the Twisters are conditioned at 290°C under a purified helium stream for 2 h.\nInstall the PDMS Twister prepared in advance on a collection device specifically designed for volatile compound collection.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]\nCollect the human volatile compounds from armpit skin surfaces of dengue patients and healthy donors. Use a special roller device designed especially for VOC profiling of human skin.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] Place a preconditioned Twister in the collection device.\nRoll over two separate 5-cm-long stretches (10-cm2 skin area) of armpit skin from each donor with the PDMS Twister for 10 min.\nAfter collection, store the PDMS Twister at −20°C until use.\nUse a two-step extraction protocol to elute the human volatile compounds adsorbed on the PDMS Twister (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2264-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. A two-step procedure for volatile elution from the PDMS Twister\nIn step 1, extract the nonpolar volatiles adsorbed on the PDMS Twister. Stir the PDMS Twister at 700 rpm with 1 mL of n-hexane at room temperature (22°C–26°C) for 60 min. We designate the n-hexane extracts as nonpolar compounds. In step 2, elute the polar volatile compounds. Stir the PDMS Twister at 700 rpm with 1 mL of methanol at room temperature (22°C–26°C) for 60 min, and the methanol extracts are designated as polar compounds.\nFirst, we prepare n-hexane and methanol to extract the volatiles adsorbed on the PDMS Twister.",
    "Stir the PDMS Twister at 700 rpm with 1 mL of n-hexane in sealed 12-mL vials (B7999-12A, Thermo Scientific) at room temperature (22°C–26°C) for 60 min. Designate the n-hexane extracts as the primary extract.\nStir the PDMS Twister at 700 rpm with 1 mL of methanol in sealed 12-mL vials at room temperature (22°C–26°C) for 60 min. Designate the methanol extracts as the secondary extract.\nStore the n-hexane extracts and methanol extracts at −80°C.\nCritical: To avoid contamination from volatile compounds released by the collectors, gloves should be worn during the collection process.\nCollection of volatiles from mouse skin bacteria\nTiming: ∼3 days\nThis procedure provides methods for culturing skin bacteria in LB liquid medium and detailed steps for collecting volatiles from the fermentation supernatant.\nPrepare a 250-mL triangular flask containing 100 mL of LB liquid medium.\nCulture individual bacterial strains in liquid LB medium for 3 days at 30°C and 180 rpm.\nTo collect the volatile compounds produced by the bacteria, centrifuge the culture at 13,000 × g for 10 min to discard the cell mass.\nAfter the cell mass is separated by centrifugation, use the fresh fermentation supernatant for the behavioral assays or store at −80°C until use.\nNote: To avoid contamination, use all glass products in steps 14–17.\nCritical: To avoid light decomposition of volatile compounds in the fresh fermentation supernatant, brown sterile sample bottles should be used for storage. If a brown sample bottle is not available, the outside of the bottle should be wrapped in aluminum foil.\nMosquito behavioral assay in mice\nTiming: ∼2 h\nIn this experiment, we test the mosquito behavioral responses to volatile cues from healthy and DENV2/ZIKV-infected mice. Place the healthy and DENV2/ZIKV-infected mice in the glass chamber, and pump the volatiles into the observing cage by constant airflow.",
    "Inject six- to eight-week-old female mice intraperitoneally with 2 × 103 p.f.u. of either the DENV2 43 strain or the ZIKV PRVABC59 strain.\nUsed a three-cage olfactometer (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) to perform a behavioral assay on the mice. Before each assay, release 60 female mosquitoes into the middle cage for at least 30 min to acclimatize them to the environment.\nDuring the assay, place healthy or DENV2/ZIKV-infected mice into a glass chamber (20 cm in height and 10 cm for the bottom diameter), and seal the jar tightly with metal caps (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nConnect the glass jars containing the healthy or DENV2/ZIKV-infected mice to the left and right chambers in the three-cage olfactometer by Teflon tubes.\nPump the volatiles released from AG6 mice into the three-cage olfactometer.\nPurify the air through an activated charcoal filter.\nPump the clean air through the chamber containing the mice at a flow rate of 1 L/min by a vacuum pump.\nPump the volatiles released from the healthy or DENV2/ZIKV-infected mice into the left and right chambers, respectively.\nAfter 30 min, count the number of mosquitoes in each cage.\nNote: To avoid interference of feces and urine with the behavioral assay, AG6 mice were anesthetized with 0.75% pentobarbital in glass chambers.\nNote: To avoid environmental effects, cage the healthy and DENV2/ZIKV-infected mice together between experiments.\nMosquito behavioral assay for human volatiles\nTiming: Variable\nIn this assay, the volatile extracts from healthy donors and dengue patients are applied to filter papers, and the filter papers are subsequently attached to the palm of a volunteer for the mosquito behavioral assay.",
    "Use a two-port olfactometer (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) to perform the behavioral assay with the volatiles collected from healthy donors and dengue patients. Before each assay, release 60 female mosquitoes into a large Plexiglas box for at least 30 min to acclimatize to the environment.\nPrepare the filter paper (3 cm in diameter).\nApply 100 μL of volatile extracts collected from the skin of healthy donors or dengue patients to the filter paper. Use an equal volume of n-hexane (or methanol) solvent as a control.\nPlace the filter paper on the left and right palms of one donor.\nThe donor places his or her left and right arms in the two stimulus ports.\nAfter 30 min, count the number of mosquitoes in each cylindrical trap.\nNote: To avoid interference of exogenous volatile compounds released by the donor (from whom the volatiles were extracted) and the volunteer (who provided the hand for the procedure), both the donor and the volunteer are asked to avoid spicy foods, garlic, and alcohol and use unperfumed soap 24 h before the behavioral assay.\nNote: The distance between the two arms of the donors and the smaller cylindrical traps is equal.\nMosquito behavioral assay for skin bacteria\nTiming: Variable\nThis experiment explains how to study the mosquito attraction response to skin bacteria. Fresh bacterial fermentation supernatant is applied to the skin of AG6 mice, and the mice treated with fermentation supernatant or LB liquid medium are placed in a glass jar, as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A.\nPrepare the fresh bacterial fermentation supernatant. Alternatively, melt the fermentation supernatant (store at −80°C) at 4°C in the refrigerator.",
    "Use the three-cage olfactometer (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) to perform the behavioral assay of the bacterial volatiles. Before each assay, release 60 female mosquitoes into the middle cage for at least 30 min to acclimatize to the environment.\nApply one milliliter of the bacterial fermentation supernatant to the back and abdomen (approximately 10 cm2 in total) of healthy AG6 mice using a paintbrush. Use an equal volume of LB liquid medium as a control.\nTreat the AG6 mice with bacterial fermentation supernatant or LB liquid medium.\nPlace the treated mice into the glass chamber.
