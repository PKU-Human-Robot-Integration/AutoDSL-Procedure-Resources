    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCell induction\nTiming: 26 h\nS RBD is expressed in yeast from a galactose-inducible promoter. The first step is to expand cells from a frozen stock and then induce S RBD display by growth on galactose.\nThaw 1mL stock of yeast cells harboring the S RBD display plasmid of the desired library for identifying escape mutants and WT for controls (Confirm that antibodies selected bind and inhibit the displayed WT RBD). It is convenient to start this growth step in the morning so that cytometer screening can be performed during daytime hours on the following day.\nPellet the cells by centrifuging 1 min at 16000 × g using a microcentrifuge, remove supernatant, and resuspend in SDCAA+ (recipe[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nTransfer culture to a 14 mL culture tube for volumes lower than 1.5 mL (VWR Cat#10127-334) or a 250 mL shaker flask for large volumes (Fisher Cat# 10040F). Incubate cells at 30°C and 300rpm for 4–6 h.\nNote: Do not grow cultures of more than 1.5 mL volume in 14 mL tubes, as they are insufficiently aerated for optimal display.\nMeasure the culture OD600 with a spectrophotometer. If 1.2 < OD600 < 5, harvest the cells by centrifugation for 1 min at 16000 × g in a microcentrifuge and resuspend to OD600=1 in SGCAA+ (recipe[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nTransfer the appropriate amount of the culture to a new 14mL culture tube or a 250mL shaker flask as necessary and incubate 22h at 22°C and 300rpm in an incubator shaker. As previously stated, we recommend using 14 mL culture tubes for the volumes lower than 1.5 mL and 250 mL shaker flasks for larger volumes.\nCompetitive binding reactions\nTiming: 4 h",
    "Yeast cells displaying nearly all possible single point mutants on surface exposed positions of S RBD are pre-incubated with a neutralizing antibody before co-incubation with biotinylated ACE2. These cells are then labeled with secondary fluorophores to detect S RBD expression and ACE2 binding. Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) is used to isolate the population of cells still able to bind ACE2.\nCritical: The binding reactions cannot be stored to sort another day. If multiple antibodies are being tested, we recommend splitting the samples into multiple days.\nTransfer the culture to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube for low volumes or a 15 mL conical tube for larger volumes and centrifuge for 1 min at 16000 × g using a centrifuge.\nMeasure the culture OD600 and resuspend the cells in ice cold PBSF to an OD600=2 for the controls and to an OD600=10 for sorting. We typically perform a 10-fold dilution of culture to determine the OD600. The yeast culture will not necessarily increase in OD600 during this 16–24 h induction.\nNote: Keep this suspension on ice during the whole procedure except when otherwise specified.\nScreen unlabeled cells\nCombine 5 μL cells with 45 μL of PBSF (‘unlabeled’ cells) in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Incubate 30 min at 20°C–25°C.\nCentrifuge 1 min at 16000 × g using a microcentrifuge and resuspend the cells in 100μL ice cold PBSF. Screen 25,000 unlabeled cells and set the FSC-A/FITC+ gate as in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B.\nCheck display of S RBD\nLabel 5 μL cells with 44 μL of PBSF and 1 μL of anti-c-myc FITC in a 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube. Mix by pipetting up and down several times. Incubate the cells on ice for 10 min protected from light.",
    "Centrifuge the cells 1 min at 16000 × g using a microcentrifuge. Wash twice with 200 μL ice cold PBSF and remove supernatant. Cell pellets can be stored on ice until ready to screen.\nResuspend the cells in 100μL ice cold PBSF and screen 25,000 cells. If the yeast does not display the S RBD, do not prepare the binding reactions and refer to troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nCheck unlabeled cells, ACE2 binding, and competitive inhibition. These are the recommended controls for WT and each library sorted. The unlabeled cells will be used to set the correct gates on FACS for each different library sorted. The ACE2 binding is the positive control and the competitive inhibition the negative control.\nSet up three separate labeling reactions in three different 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes using the cells at OD600=2. Incubate 30 min at 20°C–25°C. Ensure that the biotin:protein molar ratio has been adjusted before starting the escape mutant identification, else, refer to ‘Confirm that neutralizing antibodies selected bind and inhibit the yeast displayed glycosylated WT RBD[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.6]’.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1061_19.csv\nCentrifuge 1 min at 16000 × g using a microcentrifuge. Wash twice with 200 μL PBSF and remove supernatant.\nResuspend the second and third pellet with 50 μL fluorescent labeling mix (recipe[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]). The first tube must not be labeled. Keep the fluorophores on ice and protected from light at all times.\nIncubate 10 min on ice and protect from light.\nCentrifuge 1 min at 16000 × g using a microcentrifuge. Wash twice with 200 μL PBSF and remove supernatant. The cell pellet can be stored on ice until ready to screen. We do not recommend storing on ice for longer than 1h as fluorophores might dissociate, resulting in a lower signal.\nResuspend the cells in 100 μL PBSF and screen 25,000 cells.",
    "Competitive binding reactions to identify escape mutants\nIn a 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube add 150 μL of cells, PBSF, and 10 μg/mL antibody to a final volume of 400 μL. Incubate 30 min at 20°C–25°C. Then, add biotinylated ACE2 to a final concentration of 75nM. Again, incubate 30 min at 20°C–25°C (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nCritical: If multiple samples are sorted, it is better to incubate pellets on ice before the next step. Fluorescent label right before sorting to ensure maximum fluorescence. To minimize binding loss, stagger the binding reactions to minimize the storage time so that when the reaction is completed, the sample can be sorted.\nCentrifuge 1 min at 16000 × g using a microcentrifuge. Wash twice with 1 mL PBSF and remove supernatant. Cell pellets can be stored on ice for ∼4 h without significant binding loss if all the supernatant is removed.\nResuspend each cell pellet with 200 μL fluorescent labeling mix (recipe[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]). Keep the fluorescent labeling mix on ice and always protected from light.\nCritical: Better results are obtained if the cells are fluorescently labelled right before sorting.\nIncubate 10 min on ice and protect from light.\nCentrifuge 1 min at 16000 × g using a microcentrifuge. Wash twice with 1 mL PBSF and remove supernatant. Cell pellets can be stored covered and on ice until ready to screen.\nOptional: While sorting, the fluorescence signal might decrease over time. If the decrease is significant, divide the sample into two 500 μL samples and spin down again, remove supernatant and spin down to make sure no liquid is left in the sample. Store each pellet on ice until ready to use.\nFluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)\nTiming: approx. 40 min per sorted sample",
    "Cells are sorted by FACS using four separate gates (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). We first set an SSC/FSC gate for isolation of yeast cells. The second gate set is on FSC-H/FSC-A to discriminate single yeast cells from budding cells and/or aggregates. The third gate is an FSC-A/FITC+ gate that selects the cells displaying the RBD on their surface and excludes cells not displaying RBD. The fourth gate is a square gate collecting the top 2% by a PE+/FITC+ (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). The first three gates are set using unlabeled cells as described below. The collection PE+/FITC+ gate is adjusted for each sorted sample to collect the cells giving the top 2% PE fluorescence signal. We set a 2% limit for collecting the population of the PE fluorescence signal for two reasons. First, collecting the entire population would require collecting considerably more cells to obtain the same quality in results since different PE signal increases correlate with varying affinity. In addition, collecting the top 2% allows us to set a false discovery rate (FDR) given that cells with higher signal are likely to contain escape mutants.\nUsing the unlabeled cells, set the FSC/SSC, FSC-H/FSC-A, FSC-A/FITC+ gates as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B.\nUsing the same unlabeled cells, obtain the reference population by collecting at least 200,000 cells by sorting only for passing through the FSC/SSC gate. This reference population contains all the mutations in the library. It will be the reference to calculate the enrichment ratio for each mutation. For this and all other cell populations, collect cells into a 14mL culture tube (VWR Cat#10127-334).\nSort the control population. Here we use cells that have not labeled with antibody or ACE2 but have been fluorescently labeled with SAPE and anti-c-myc FITC. Collect 200,000 cells that pass through FSC/SSC, FSC-H/FSC-A, FSC-A/FITC+, and the PE+/FITC+ gates.",
    "For every other sample, collect 200,000 cells that pass through FSC/SSC, FSC-H/FSC-A, FSC-A/FITC+, and the PE+/FITC+ gates. The square PE+/FITC+ gates will have to be reset for each sample to ensure 2% collection.\nNote: Using our Sony SH-800 cytometer, it typically takes 40min to collect 200,000 cells in the control and sample populations. This time results from a sorting rate of 5-10,000 cells per sec and maintaining a 70% sorting efficiency.\nNote: To avoid complexity bottlenecks, it is important that the number of collected cells is at least 150× the theoretical library size. For a library with NNK mutations on 56 and 63 mutations for library 1 and 2 respectively, 168,000 cells for library 1 and 189,000 cells for library 2 must be collected. Results are improved with more collected cells.\nCell recovery\nTiming: 3 days\nCells are recovered and yeast stocks are prepared.\nDay 1\nCentrifuge collection tube containing the collected cells 5 min at 3200 × g using a centrifuge. Collected cells are smaller than typical yeast bulk population, and therefore a longer centrifugation time of 5 min is required.\nRemove approx. 80% of the supernatant and resuspend in 1.5mL SDCAA+ at 30°C for 16–20 h at 300rpm in an incubator shaker in the 14mL culture tubes.\nNote: 14mL culture tubes cannot hold more than 1.5mL. Larger volumes are not well aerated. To use a larger resuspension volume, grow the culture in a 25 mL shaker flask.\nDay 2\nPassage cells into 3 culture tubes using 1.5mL SDCAA+ on each. Incubate at 30°C and 300rpm for 16–24 h.\nDay 3\nPrepare 1mL cell stocks at OD600=4 in yeast storage buffer at −80°C.\nCentrifuge the cell culture 2 min at 3200 × g.",
    "Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in yeast storage buffer (recipe[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) at OD600=4. Stocks can be stored for over a year at −80oC. In total, at least 1 mL cell stock at OD600=4 is needed for deep sequencing preparation.\nDeep sequencing library preparation\nTiming: 1–2 days\nAfter 16–24 h of growth, plasmid DNA from this population is isolated and prepared for deep sequencing. Plasmid DNA from cells is extracted and amplicons prepared for Illumina sequencing (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). The protocol used is adapted from Method B detailed in Kowalsky et al. (2015)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1061-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Schematic of deep sequencing library preparation\nBarcodes and Illumina adapters are added to the DNA library through two rounds of PCR. The amplicon is sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq.\nDay 1: Yeast miniprep\nPerform a yeast miniprep.\nOn ice, thaw a cell stock prepared in step 23.\nPellet the cells by centrifuging 1 min at 16000 × g using a microcentrifuge and resuspend in 200 μL Solution 1 from Zymo Yeast Plasmid Miniprep II kit.\nAdd 5μL Zymolyase (5U/μL).\nIncubate in a 37˚°C incubator for 4h on an end-to-end mixer or incubate at 37°C with mixing by pipetting up and down (ten times) every hour.\nPerform 1 freeze-thaw cycle using a dry ice/EtOH bath followed by a 42°C incubation for 10 min. Alternatively, freeze at −80°C for 20 min and thaw at 42°C in a temperature bath.\nAdd 200 μL Solution 2 from Zymo Yeast Plasmid Miniprep kit, mix end-over-end and let sit for 5 min. The solution will be transparent.\nAdd 400 μL Solution 3 from Zymo Yeast Plasmid Miniprep kit mix end-over-end centrifuge 5 min at 16000 × g. The solution will turn yellow, and precipitate will form.\nTransfer supernatant to a NEB miniprep column.",
    "Note: The NEB miniprep column has a higher DNA binding capacity (15 μg) compared to the Zymo miniprep columns (5 μg). The rationale for using NEB miniprep columns is that lysed cells contain large amounts of sheared yeast genomic DNA in addition to the desired plasmid DNA.\nCentrifuge 1 min at 16000 × g using a microcentrifuge.\nAdd 700 μL Wash 1 buffer from NEB mini-prep kit and centrifuge 1 min at 16000 × g.\nAdd 700 μL Wash 2 buffer from NEB mini-prep kit and centrifuge 1 min at 16000 × g.\nAdd again 700 μL Wash 2 buffer from NEB mini-prep kit and centrifuge 1 min at 16000 × g.\nDecant the supernatant and centrifuge 1 min at 16000 × g to dry the column.\nAdd 30 μL elution buffer from NEB mini-prep kit to elute the DNA and centrifuge 1 min at 16000 × g.\nReload column with eluate and spin again.\nEnzymatic cleanup of yeast genomic DNA.

If this band is not seen, refer to troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]. If products cannot be seen in a SYBR safe gel, there will not be enough DNA for sequencing (minimum 2ng DNA is required).\nClean up with Agencourt AMPure XP following standard procedure on a 96 well format (Instructions For Use[href=https://www.beckmancoulter.com/wsrportal/techdocs?docname=B37419]).\nQuantification with Quant-iT™ PicoGreen™ dsDNA Reagent following standard procedure (Quant-iT™ PicoGreen ® dsDNA Reagent and Kits[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Fmp07581.pdf&title=UXVhbnQtaVQgUGljb0dyZWVuIGRzRE5BIFJlYWdlbnQgYW5kIEtpdHM=]).\nPrepare Quant-iTTM reagent.\nThaw Quant-iTTM reagent at 20°C–25°C covered in foil.\nPrepare a working solution by diluting the Quant-iTTM reagent 200-fold in TE.\nCritical: The working solution must be prepared on the same day of the quantification and stay protected from the light, preferably wrapped in aluminum foil.\nIn a black 96-well plate (Product # 3792), prepare a 1:2 standard curve starting at 100ng/mL of Lambda DNA using the first row of the plate. Add 100 μL in each well and include a blank with 100 μL TE.\nIn the same plate, add 1 μL of purified sample in 99 μL TE.\nNote: If the sample concentration is < 40 ng/μL, up to 2.5 μL of sample can be used. On the contrary, if the concentration is too high, necessary dilutions in IDTE can be carried out.",
    "Add 100 μL Quant-iTTM working solution to each well and incubate for 5 min at 20°C–25°C while covered in foil.\nMeasure the fluorescence using a plate reader (ex: 480nm, em: 520 nm). Subtract the blank from all the samples and use the Lambda DNA serial dilutions to generate a standard curve of fluorescence vs DNA concentration. With the curve, determine the concentration of each sample. In our hands the concentrations are between 6 ng/μL and 60 ng/μL.\nPool individual barcoded amplicons into a single test tube. In a 1.5 mL tube, mix equivalent molar amounts of each sample to have the same number of reads and submit to a sequencing facility.\nIllumina sequencing\nLibraries can be sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq using the MiSeq V2-500 cycle kit. While we have used the University of Colorado sequencing core, there are commercial and academic cores that offer sequencing as a fee-for-service (NovoGene or Rush University Medical Center, for example). The libraries have been split into two tiles assuming the use of 250 bp paired end sequencing, but our software supports longer paired-end reads as well. One critical detail essential for sequencing is dealing with the low nucleotide diversity of the RBD libraries. We circumvent this issue primarily by instructing the sequencing core to add PhiX in the pooled library, which is a crucial step for correct clustering of the sequences. PhiX is a well characterized adapter-ligated library that helps balance nucleotide diversity. We have obtained good sequencing results with 35% PhiX. Refer to troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7] if the DNA is not clustering correctly.\nWe typically obtain around 90% coverage for all the libraries screened.\nRun software and generate results\nTiming:  <1 h",
    "This is the primary computational step in the protocol. This software package can perform all necessary analysis and interpretation of results. With the completion of this step, potential escape mutations are identified for a given antibody.\nSoftware description\nThis software is divided into two separate modules. The first module manages the input FASTQ files and is abbreviated ‘dms’ for deep mutational scanning. The second module, titled ‘analysis’, is responsible for interpreting the output generated from the dms module. Apart from specifying which experiment to analyze before the analysis module is run, the transition between these two modules is seamless.\nThis protocol results in a total of three output files. The dms module generates one of these files and the analysis module identifies the other two. The output from the dms module is a comma-separated values (CSV) file that identifies the single mutations, their corresponding counts in each population, and an enrichment ratio (ER) that compares these counts. Next, the analysis module generates a CSV file with additional columns to the file generated in the dms module. The new columns identify the following for each observed mutation: the threshold ER value determined from the control data for a given tile, the p-value calculated by the one-sided exact Poisson rate ratio test, the FDR value, and the minimum number of nucleotides away the given mutation could be from the wild type sequence. The second output of the analysis module is a heatmap in Microsoft Excel that identifies potential escape mutations in blue. Refer to Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] for details on the outputs mentioned above.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1061-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. An example of the analysis output from the software",
    "The CSV file is first generated, adding the results of statistical calculations. The second output from the analysis module is the Microsoft Excel document containing a heatmap with escape mutant residues identified. In the heatmap, wild type residues and positions are listed in the top two rows of the file and each possible mutation is listed in the left column. Three colors exist in each Excel output file: gray cells indicate that the mutation was not observed in the population; white cells indicate mutations that were observed in the population but did not meet the criteria for escape mutant; and, blue cells represent mutations that meet the necessary criteria to be classified as potential escape mutants for the given antibody.\nThe dms module assumes that amplicons are of the same fixed length and that each amplicon is read in both the forward and reverse directions, leading to a pair of FASTQ files. When the module is run, it merges the paired reads of the FASTQ files, collapses identical synonymous mutations into single counts, and subsequently calculates enrichment ratios between specified populations (see ‘quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis] section’). A detailed explanation of this process has already been published (Fowler et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Klesmith and Hackel, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nThe analysis module performs the necessary analytical steps to identify the escape mutations. While a thorough explanation of the statistical approach is detailed in Quantification and statistical analysis, please refer to Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] for an overview of the entire process.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1061-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

    "Complete the configuration file to include the details of the experiment. For the dms module, the user should fill out the configuration file to include all experiments. Therefore, the module can be run once and the analysis can be streamlined. An example configuration file is on Github. We recommend that this example file is copied and that the original document remains available for reference. For an explanation of each section and option in the configuration file, please refer to Tables 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3].\nIf the experiment of interest only uses one tile, refer to troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9].\nCritical: The example configuration file is already filled out so that users only need to complete the file names, the file paths, and create names for their experiments. If the original libraries are used, no additional changes are needed to the configuration file. All other parameters and details are set as default and do not need to be changed for a successful run of the software.\nRun the software by execution of commands at the command line. Some command line flags can be used here to override information set in the configuration file.

The files are always deposited into the folder titled “Output”. If that folder does not exist in the directory, an output folder will be created.",
    "Note: The dms package is a general deep mutational scanning tool. It can be run independently of any other analysis and does not depend on the other module described here.\nRun the analysis module with the following command (again, assume the configuration file is titled example.config and that it is found in the root directory). The [Analysis] section of the configuration file must be updated before every run to represent accurate experiments. However, all other sections of the configuration file should remain the same for both modules:\npython3 -m analysis --config example.config\nDetails on the approach for this analysis can be found in the Quantification and statistical analysis section.\nThe analysis module will deposit output files in a folder found in the root directory. The files are always deposited into the folder titled “Processed”. If that folder does not exist in the directory, the folder will be created.\nNote: We provide the CSV outputs of the dms module on Github in the “Output” folder. There are two files: one representing the control population (example_control.csv), cells without ACE2 labeling, and the other representing an antibody population for CC12.1 (Francino-Urdaniz et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]), titled example_CC12.1.csv. In addition, the example configuration file provided is already configured to properly run the analysis module with these example files. The only required change is to update the file paths to the Output folder containing the aforementioned example files. To run the analysis module with this data, follow the instructions in step 34b.\nCritical: The analysis module is written with the intention that it will be executed shortly after running the dms module. Therefore, if output files of the dms module are significantly edited, the analysis module may not run as expected.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1061_30.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1061_31.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1061_32.csv"
