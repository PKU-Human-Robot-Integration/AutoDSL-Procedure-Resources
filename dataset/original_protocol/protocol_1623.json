(2016)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7].\nThaw low passage (P16 or less) cryopreserved HEK293T cells in a 37°C water bath.\nAdd 10 mL of complete DMEM media to 15 mL falcon tube.\nRemove frozen HEK293T cryovial from liquid nitrogen tank.\nPlace HEK293T cryovial in a 37°C water bath immediately after retrieving from liquid nitrogen tank. As soon as there is one ice crystal remaining, transfer cells drop wise into the 15 mL falcon tube.\nCentrifuge tube at 300 × g for 5 min.\nRemove supernatant and count cells with Trypan Blue.\nResuspend 1.5–2 million HEK293T cells in 20 mL of complete DMEM media and transfer to a T-150 tissue culture flask. Culture flasks at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nNote: Always start lentivirus prep with freshly thawed HEK293T cells to ensure higher viral yield. Around 2–3 80% confluent T-150 flasks are needed for one batch of lentiviral prep.\n24 h prior to transfection, harvest HEK293T cells by washing flasks with 10 mL warm PBS and adding 3 mL warm 1× Trypsin-EDTA(0.05%). Place flasks in the incubator for 2–5 min and neutralize trypsin with 3× the volume of warm complete DMEM media.\nNote: Cells should be ∼80% confluent three days post-thaw. HEK293T cells are very loosely adherent thus do not require a long incubation time with Trypsin. Use Trypsin to harvest cells to prevent cell clumping.\nTransfer cell suspension to a 50 mL falcon tube and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min. Resuspend cell pellet with warm complete DMEM media and count cells using Trypan Blue.",
    "Note: Use antibiotic-free complete DMEM media to plate cells prior to transfection as it may interfere with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent.\nPlate 9 million HEK293T cells in 15 mL of antibiotic-free complete DMEM media per 15 cm NUNC tissue-culture treated plate. Incubate plates at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nRe-seed a T-150 flask with 1.5–2 million cells in 20 mL of complete DMEM media for lentiviral titration.\nNote: Typically, three 15 cm plates are required to obtain sufficient viral particles per prep, scale up as needed. Carefully place plates into incubator ensuring that plates are even to make sure media covers each plate evenly.\nTransfection can begin 24 h after plating HEK293T cells, at this point cells should be ∼70%–80% confluent.\nNote: Measure concentration of all plasmids used prior to transfection using a spectrophotometer that measures the concentration and purity of nucleic acids.\nFor each plate, prepare two 15 mL falcon tubes with 4 mL of Opti-MEM media labeled Tube A and Tube B.\nPrepare transfection mixture by following schematic in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1185-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Flowchart depicting how to prepare transfection mixture\n(1) Add required amount of plasmid DNA to Tube B and mix gently by inverting tube 3 times (3×). (2) Add 120 uL of Lipofectamine 2000 to Tube A and mix gently by inverting tube 3 times. (3) Incubate Tube A for 5 min at 20°C–22°C. (4) Add Tube B to Tube A, mix gently by inverting tube 3 times. (5) Incubate for 20 min at 20°C–22°C. (6) Add transfection mixture to each plate.\nSlowly add the DNA and Lipofectamine mixture to each plate drop wise making sure to cover the entire plate area. Swirl plate carefully and slowly to evenly distribute the mixture.\nIncubate plates at 37°C and 5% CO2.",
    "Alternatives: Lipofecatamine (lipid based transfection agent) can be substituted with chemical methods such as calcium phosphate for the transfection. However, the amount of total DNA added should be optimized using this method. Refer to Brown et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] and Follenzi and Naldini (2002)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] for protocols on LV production using calcium phosphate.\n12–16 h after transfection, carefully aspirate media and replace with 15 mL warm antibiotic-containing complete DMEM media supplemented with 1 mM of sodium butyrate.\nNote: Sodium butyrate is added as it has been shown to enhance HIV-1 derived vector production (Olsen and Sechelski, 1995[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nCritical: During this step, there may be lift off the HEK293T cells from the plate which can decrease viral yield. To avoid this ensure that DMEM media is warmed up to 37°C and aspirate media as slowly as possible. Only work with up to three plates at a time.\nIncubate plates at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nNote: From this point forward, you will be working with virus samples. Ensure you are following proper BSL-2 guidelines when handling lentivirus.\n36–48 h after transfection, lentivirus released in the supernatant can be harvested for viral concentration.\nCritical: In our experience, the use of ultracentrifugation to concentrate the virus cannot be replaced with other methods of viral concentration such ultrafiltration. We have found that viral preps obtained from ultrafiltration do not efficiently transduce NK cells.\nNote: Pre-cool the SW-32 Ti ultracentrifuge rotor and buckets at 4°C before starting the harvest.\nAspirate viral containing supernatant from the 15 cm plates and transfer to 50 mL falcon tubes.\nCentrifuge the 50 mL falcon tubes at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to sediment any collected cells.\nFilter supernatant using a 150 mL 0.45 μM PES filter to remove cell debris.",
    "Alternatives: A filter with a pore size of 0.22 μM can also be used to improve purity. However, a size of 0.45 μM is used in this protocol to avoid any loss of viral particles during the filtration.\nAdd filtrate into 38.5 mL ultracentrifuge tubes and use cold PBS to bring tube within 0.5 cm of the edge to prevent centrifuge tube from collapsing.\nCarefully balance the centrifuge tubes before placing into the ultracentrifuge buckets.\nCritical: Ultracentrifuge buckets containing tubes must be balanced within 0.02g.\nCentrifuge buckets at 130,000 × g for 1 h 40 min at 4°C with minimal deceleration.\nCarefully remove ultracentrifuge tube from ultracentrifuge bucket and pour the supernatant into a 20% bleach bucket.\nKeep the ultracentrifuge tube inverted and blot the excess supernatant onto paper towels for up to 1 min to prevent viral pellet from drying out.\nImmediately place the ultracentrifuge tube on ice and let it sit for 10 min to begin viral resuspension.\nCritical: Avoid the formation of bubbles during resuspension of the viral pellet. Keep virus on ice at all times until placing in the −80°C freezer.\nNote: From this point forward only use micropipette filter tips when handling the virus.\nAdd between 50–100 μL of cold PBS and start to slowly scrape the bottom of the ultracentrifuge tube using a micropipette filter tip.\nNote: Set the micropipette to a low volume (∼40 μL) and do not go to the second stop while resuspending to avoid formation of bubbles.\nNote: The volume of PBS added to resuspend the viral pellet can be adjusted depending on your experience with the particular LV. For example, you can add a higher volume of PBS to lentivirus preps that have higher yields. If you consistently obtain a low viral yield see Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].",
    "Using the same micropipette filter tip, slowing resuspend the pellet by gently pipetting up and down and wash the sides of the ultracentrifuge tube.\nOnce viral pellet is fully resuspended aliquot virus into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and immediately place into −80°C freezer.\nPrepare one aliquot of 13 μL to use for the lentiviral titration.\nDecontaminate anything that has come into contact with the virus using 70% ethanol.\nNote: Minimize the production of aerosols when working in BSL2 conditions.\nLentivirus titration on HEK293T cells\nTiming: 4 days; variable flow time\nThe lentivirus stock should be titrated using HEK293T cells prior to NK cell transduction. To determine the titer, HEK293T cells are first transduced with serial dilutions of the lentivirus stock and they are then stained to measure the expression of the transduction marker by flow cytometry. The titer is calculated using the following formula: Titer (TU/mL)= ((# of HEK293T cells transduced × % Transgene-positive cells × Dilution factor)/100). The expected titer for the lentivirus containing the HER2 CAR construct used in this study is between 3 × 107–2 × 108 TU/mL.\nCritical: The lentiviral constructs used in this study contain the NGFR transduction marker. Lentivirus with a titer >3 × 107 TU/mL is necessary for NK cell transduction (Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nHarvest HEK293T cells from a T-150 flask and count using Trypan Blue.\nNote: Perform two separate counts and take the average to ensure the cell count is accurate.\nCritical: The titration is dependent on accurately plating 30,000 cells per well.\nPlate 30,000 HEK293T cells per well in a 24-well tissue culture plate.\nResuspend cells to 6 × 104 cells/mL using complete DMEM media.\nUp to 6-wells will be needed for each lentivirus batch, using dilutions 10−2 to 10−6 and one control well with no virus.",
    "Resuspend the cell suspension 3 times and add 500 μL per well.\nIncubate plate at 37°C and 5% CO2 for at least 3 h to ensure HEK293T cells have adhered.\nPrepare lentivirus serial dilutions following Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1185-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Flowchart of serial dilutions for stock lentivirus titration on HEK293T cells.\nPrepare dilutions using 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes in complete DMEM media.\nMix each dilution thoroughly by pipetting or vortexing.\nThoroughly mix and add 500 μL of each dilution per well.\nAdd 500 μL of complete DMEM media to the no virus control well.\nIncubate plate at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 72 h.\nAlternatives: We find that assessing transgene expression after 72 h post HEK293T cell transduction is adequate to obtain a determination of LV titer. However, if a highly accurate titer is needed waiting 5 days post transduction could minimize the proportion of HEK293T cells that express the transgene but has not been successfully integrated.\nCarefully harvest the transduced HEK293T cells using 1000 μL micropipette filter tips.\nSlowly pipette up and down first in the centre of each well and then around the edges.\nTransfer cells to 5 mL polysterene tubes with caps.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min and decant supernatant.\nResuspend cell pellet, add 2 mL of cold PBS and invert capped tubes to mix.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min and decant supernatant.\nPrepare a 1:1000 dilution of viability dye using eBioscience Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 780 in PBS.\nResuspend cell pellet and add 100 μL of viability dye mixture to each tube.\nIncubate at 4°C for 30 min in the dark.\nPrepare antibody mix during the incubation by adding 1 μL of VioBright FITC Mouse Anti-Human CD271 (LNGFR) antibody into 49 μL of FACS buffer (1:50 dilution) per test.",

However, we recommend acquiring samples within 24–48 h.\nDecontaminate anything that has come into contact with the virus using 70% ethanol.\nNote: Minimize the production of aerosols when working in BSL2 conditions.\nTransduction of expanded NK cells with HER2 CAR lentivirus construct\nTiming: 3 days",
    "This step describes the process of transducing expanded NK cells with 3rd generation LVs. Prior to NK cell transduction, determine the number of NK cells you need to transduce to perform downstream functional assays. In addition, you need to determine the amount of lentivirus needed to transduce desired number of wells at the desired MOI. Typically an MOI of 5 results in sufficient transduction efficiency. This is based on the LV titers typically obtained with our construct after titration on HEK293T cells. However, the MOIs used should be optimized depending on the size of your CAR lentiviral construct.\nNote: Primary NK cells should be expanded by co-cultured with irradiated K562 mb-IL21 feeder cells at a 2:1 ratio for at least 2 weeks before transduction.\nA day before transduction, replenish expanded NK cells with irradiated K562 mb-IL21 cells at a 1:1 ratio.\nSeven days after the last replenishment, count NK cells with Trypan Blue.\nResuspend the co-culture to a final concentration of 0.5 × 106 cells/mL in complete RPMI media supplemented with 100 IU/mL of IL-2.\nPlate 200 μL of the co-culture into a 96-well U bottom plate for a total of 1 × 105 cells per well.\nIncubate plate for 12–18 h at 37°C and 5% CO2.\n18–24 h after plating, centrifuge 96-well U bottom plate at 300 × g for 10 min.\nDuring the centrifugation, prepare the NK cell transduction media.\nCarefully remove the supernatant from each well, and resuspend cells with 90 μL of NK cell transduction media using a multichannel pipette.\nCritical: Prepare fresh NK cell transduction media each time.\nPlace plate in the incubator (37°C and 5% CO2) while you prepare the viral suspension.",
    "Critical: Pre-warm the centrifuge to 32°C prior to thawing your virus so that you can perform the spinfection process as soon as possible.\nPrepare viral suspension by diluting the stock with the appropriate amount of cold PBS to add 10 μL of viral suspension per well at an MOI of 5.\nNote: Thaw your lentivirus containing the CAR construct and the control vector on ice. If the lentivirus titre is <5 × 107 TU/mL do not dilute in PBS.\nExample: To calculate the amount of lentivirus needed to transduced 5 wells at an MOI of 5 use the following calculation (use virus titer obtained from the HEK293T titration):\n((1 × 105 × MOI × # of wells)/virus titer(TU/mL)) × 1000 = Total amount of virus needed (μL)\nOnce the virus suspension is prepared, obtain 96-well plate from the incubator and add 10 μL of virus suspension per well.\nAdd 10 μL of PBS to the non-transduced control wells.\nImmediately centrifuge the plate at 1000 × g for 45 min at 32°C as the spinoculation step.\nNote: In our experience, we find that while spinoculation is not necessary for lentiviral transduction of human T cells, it does enhance the transduction efficiency of expanded NK cells. However, this step may be skipped depending on the size and titer of your lentiviral construct but should be optimized.\nGently resuspend the wells using a micropipette and incubate plate for 12–18 h at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nThe next day, centrifuge the plate at 300 × g for 10 min.\nCarefully remove the supernatant and resuspend cells to a final volume of 100 μL using complete RMPI media supplemented with 100 IU/mL of IL-2.\nThree to four days after transduction, HER2 CAR-NK cells can be stained to assess HER2 CAR transgene expression.",
    "Assessing HER2 CAR expression by flow cytometry\nTiming: 3–4 h set up and staining; variable flow time\nThis procedure describes how to assess expression of the HER2 CAR transgene after NK cell lentiviral transduction. The HER2 CAR transgene used in this study is under the EF1a promoter and the transduction marker is under the CMV promoter, the construct is described in Hammill et al.

However, we recommend acquiring samples within 24–48 h.\nNote: Prepare single color compensation controls using compensation beads prior to sample acquisition by flow cytometry.\nTransfer cells to appropriate tubes for flow cytometry and perform sample acquisition.\nNote: Ensure that HER2 CAR-NK cells have a minimum of 15% CAR transgene expression before functional assays (Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nFlow cytometry-based HER2 CAR-NK cell cytotoxicity assay\nTiming: 1–3 h setup time; 5 h incubation time; 2 h staining time\nThis step describes how to prepare target cells for the flow cytometry-based cytotoxicity assay and how to plate the effector and target cells. We recommend using 100,000–200,000 target cells but this number can be reduced to 50,000 cells. We recommend to include at least three Effector:Target (E:T) ratios in the cytotoxicity assay to obtain a killing curve.\nLabel a 96-well plate layout with all of your conditions, follow Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] as an example.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1185-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.
