  "procedures": [
    "Animal use follows approved breeding and animal use protocols that conform to the Animal Care and Use Guidelines of Colorado State University.\nNOTE: The protocol below describes the preparation and culture method for the long-term incubation and intermittent imaging of hippocampal slices. A single hippocampal slice is attached to a specially prepared photoetched coverslip using a plasma clot, and then the coverslips are sealed onto the flat side of a drilled-out roller tube, which is maintained in a roller incubator. Plasma clots are dissolved with plasmin before viral infection for fluorescent protein expression and high-resolution imaging. A fluorescent neuronal vital dye is used to image neurons within the slices.\n1. Preparation of Roller Tube Rack\nUse the template shown in Figure 1A printed to the size shown on the scale bar. With a nail, punch small holes (large enough for a fine point marker) in the template centered on the holes.\nSet the template on the bottom of a 15 cm tissue culture dish (nominal diameter of 14 cm) and mark the position of the holes. Repeat this on a second dish.\nWith drill bits designed for use on plastic, drill six 1.5 cm diameter holes on each dish in a hexagonal array (4.8 cm center-to-center) with hole centers 2.5 cm from the edge of the dish. Drill three holes (3 mm in diameter) 12 mm from the edge that are placed equidistantly between two of the larger holes as shown in Figure 1A.",
    "With the bottoms of each dish facing each other, place a 2.5 inch long machine screw (3/16 inch diameter) with a flat washer through one of the small holes followed by a second flat washer, a piece of polyethylene tubing (spacer, 4.7 cm), another flat washer, the second tissue culture dish, another flat washer, a locking washer, and a nut.\nRepeat step 1.4 on the other two machine screws, and tightening only loosely until all machine screws are in place. Then tighten the nuts securely.\nWork the grommets (5/16 inch thick, 5/8 inch hole diameter) into the holes of the bottom dish to obtain the final roller tube rack (Figure 1B; shown with two tubes in place). Place a sticker on each rack with a unique number.\n2. Preparation of Roller Tubes and Coverslips\nMaking the jig for drilling the hole in roller tubes\nDrill a 1.5 cm hole 8 cm deep in the center side of a 2 x 4 x 5.5 inch wooden block at an angle such that the flat side of the roller tube will be nearly parallel with the block when inserted (Figure 2A).\nEnlarge the hole using a round wood file to both widen and taper the hole to allow tube insertion (roller tubes are slightly larger in diameter near the cap end) (Figure 2B).\nDrill a 1.5 cm diameter vertical hole, 5.5 cm from the side of the block, and centered over the side hole (Figure 2C).\nWhen the side hole is tapered enough, insert a roller tube that is marked at the desired spot to center the hole for the slice and position the tube so the marked spot is centered in the 1.5 cm vertical hole.",
    "Remove the tube and measure the distance from the spot to the end of the tube. Mark this distance from the center of the hole in the jig and insert a nail to provide a stop to correctly position the tube for drilling (arrow in Figure 2C).\nUse a hacksaw to cut the nail off flush with the surface of the wood block to prevent injury.\nAdd spring clips on the bottom of the jig if there is a drill press with slots that allow it to be anchored (Figure 2D black arrow). Otherwise, use C-clamps to hold the jig securely onto the drill press.\nUsing the jig described above to hold and position a flat sided 11 cm plastic culture tube with the flat side up (Figure 2A), drill a 6 mm diameter hole with the center 1.0 cm from the bottom and centered between the sides of the tube.\n\tNOTE: A drill bit designed for plastic should be used.\nWith a swiveling deburring tool, smooth the edges of the hole (Figure 2E) and make 4 grooves on the inside edge of the hole (Figure 2E, inset) to facilitate draining of the hole during rotation.\nWith a 12 mm hole punch, cut 12 mm diameter disks from non-toxic double sided adhesive silicon rubber sheets. Using a standard one hole paper punch (6 mm diameter), make a hole in the center of each disk.\nRinse the drilled tubes with 70% ethanol, air dry them in a biological safety cabinet, and sterilize the tubes and the punched adhesive discs for 40 min under the UV lamp (30 W at 70 cm average distance) in the biological safety cabinet.",
    "Reposition the tubes and discs after 20 min so that all exposed surfaces are sterilized. Under sterile conditions, peel off the white backing from an adhesive disc and affix the silicone rubber to the outside of a tube, aligning the holes (Figure 2F).\n\tCaution: To avoid UV exposure, wear eye protection and close the cabinet before turning on the UV lamp.\nClean 12 mm diameter photoetched (100 center numbered 1 mm squares) German glass coverslips. Hold the coverslips gently with forceps and dip in absolute ethanol, followed by water, followed by absolute ethanol again, and finally dip the coverslips in a flame to burn off the ethanol. Allow coverslips to cool.\nHolding the coverslips with forceps, dip into 2% 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane in acetone for 10 s. Rinse the coverslips with ultrapure water and allow to air dry.\nSet the coverslips on sterile filter paper inside of a biological safety cabinet and turn on the UV light. Expose each side of the coverslips for 20 min.\n\tCaution: To avoid UV exposure, wear eye protection and close the cabinet before turning on the UV lamp.\n3. Hippocampal Slice Preparation\nBefore starting the dissection, prepare halves of double-edged razor blades for the tissue chopper. Fold the blades lengthwise carefully with fingers and snap in half.\nRinse the blade halves with acetone using a cotton swab to clean them, followed by rinsing in absolute ethanol and air drying. Before mounting a half blade on the tissue chopper, sterilize it by rinsing with 70% ethanol.\nFollow protocols approved by the institutional Animal Care and Use Committee; after isoflurane anesthesia, euthanize a 4-7 day old mouse or rat pup by decapitation and remove the head with scissors or guillotine.",
    "NOTE: The brain slice culture protocol is independent of mouse or rat strain or genotype. Many transgenic mouse lines with different genetic backgrounds have been used.\nRinse the head with 70% ethanol, and place it in a 60 mm Petri dish. Until the final mounting of the brain slice onto the roller tube, all of the following steps are performed in a laminar flow hood to maintain sterility.\nUsing a #21 surgical blade, make a sagittal cut through the skin and skull. With a #5 Dumont forceps, peel back the skin and skull to expose the brain.\nWith closed forceps, gently tease out the whole brain, releasing it by pinching with the forceps through the brain stem behind the cerebellum. Place the brain in a sterile 60 mm dish containing 4 °C Gey's Balanced Salt Solution/0.5% glucose (GBSS/glucose).\nUsing a dissection microscope to visualize the brain (Figure 3A), place the brain dorsal side up and cut off the front third of the brain and the cerebellum with a surgical blade (Figure 3B).\nWith forceps, hold the trimmed brain posterior side up and ventral side against the side of the Petri dish for stability. Gently tease away meninges around the sagittal midline and remove the midbrain tissue using a fine tipped Dumont #5 forceps (Figure 3C, dashed circle).\nMake two cuts along the side of the brain to spread it open (Figure 3C, dashed lines). Once the brain is placed dorsal side down and spread open, the hippocampal fissure should be visible (Figure 3D, arrow).\nTransfer the spread open brain to a piece of polychlorotrifluoroethylene plastic film and position it for slicing on the stage of a tissue chopper. Wet the blade with GBSS/glucose and chop the hippocampus into ~300 µm thick slices.",
    "With a transfer pipette, flush the sliced brain off the plastic film into a fresh 60 mm dish containing GBSS/glucose (Figure 3E). Gently pinch off and tease away, with fine tipped forceps, the remaining meninges and other non-hippocampal tissue (Figure 3F) from the slices (Figure 3G, H).\n4. Plating Slices\nOnce slices have been obtained, place 2 µL of chicken plasma on the center of the photoetched side of a prepared coverslip. Spread the plasma slightly to achieve a 3-4 mm diameter spot.\n\tNOTE: The photoetched side is the top side of the coverslip when viewed through a dissection microscope such that the numbers are oriented correctly.\nTransfer 1 brain slice with a sterile narrow-tip spatula (Figure 4A) to the plasma spot (Figure 4B). Use closed forceps to keep the slice on the spatula tip while lifting the slice from the GBSS/glucose.\nTouch the spatula to the plasma spot on the coverslip, and with closed forceps, push the slice onto the coverslip.\nMix 2.5 µL of plasma with 2.5 µL of thrombin in a separate tube. Quickly place 2.5 µL of this mixture over and around the slice and pipet up and down gently to mix it (Figure 4B).\n\tNOTE: The plasma will clot within 10-15 s, so this must be done quickly. If slice adhesion is a problem, mix 5 µL plasma with 5 µL thrombin and use  4-5 µL on the slice, removing some after mixing so that the slice lies flat on the coverslip.\nRemove the clear plastic covering from the exposed side of the silicone rubber adhesive previously affixed to a roller tube and place the coverslip with the brain slice onto the adhesive aligning the slice within the hole (Figure 4C).",
    "To ensure adhesion, apply soft, even pressure to the coverslip with the thumb by pressing the coverslip down evenly and holding it for about 1 min while transferring it to the biological safety cabinet.\nIn a biological safety cabinet, add 0.8 mL of complete Neurobasal A culture medium (Table of Materials) to each tube (Figure 4D).\nFlow a 5% CO2/95% air mixture through a sterile cotton-plugged Pasteur pipette held securely by a clamp. Flush the roller tube with the gas mixture and rapidly cap the tube as it is withdrawn from around the pipette.\nLabel the tubes with the slice number and rack number. Insert tubes into a roller rack, ensuring they are geometrically balanced. If there is an odd number of tubes, add tubes to balance.\nPlace the racks in a 35 °C roller incubator with rollers turning the roller rack at about 10-13 RPH (Figure 4E). To keep the medium in the bottom of the tubes, tilt the incubator back approximately 5° by raising its front on a board.\nEnter the slice and tube number onto a spreadsheet, which is used to record all information of slice treatments and observation dates.\nOn approximately day 6 in culture, add 1 µL (0.002 U) of active plasmin to each tube.\nAfter the clots dissolve completely (usually within a few hours), remove the medium and replace it with fresh medium without plasmin. If necessary, slices can be incubated with plasmin overnight and the medium changed the next day.\nSlices are usually incubated for at least 7-10 days before use in experiments. Aspirate medium and replace it on day 3 or 4, again on day 7, and every 7 days thereafter.\n5. Preparation of Viral Vectors for Transgene Expression",
    "NOTE: Expression of transgenes in neurons of slice cultures is achieved either by using brains from genetically engineered rodents or by introducing the transgene by infection with recombinant replication deficient viruses. Adenoviruses (AV), adeno-associated viruses (AAV), and recombinant lentivirus vectors have all been used in our hippocampal slice cultures for expression of different fluorescent protein chimeras in brain slices.\nPrepare replication deficient AV for expressing the RNA of interest according to methods described elsewhere13,14. Titer the viruses for infectious U/mL by the serial dilution method using an antibody to a virally expressed protein as described14. To observe cofilin aggregates and cofilin-actin rod formation, utilize the cofilin-R21Q-mRFP cDNA (plasmid #51279)16.\n\tNOTE: The synapsin 1 promoter is an excellent choice for neuronal specific expression15, whereas the cytomegalovirus promoter is useful for driving high expression levels in many cell types13.\nPrepare AAV by co-transfection of transfer plasmid containing the gene of interest and a rep/cap plasmid, with or without a helper plasmid, into HEK293 packaging cells, which supply the viral E1 gene, as previously described17,18.\n\tNOTE: Recombinant AAV can also be made for targeted insertion into the host cell genome19. For the transfer plasmid, we use human cofilin 1 with a C-terminal mRFP1 fluorescence protein tag (plasmid #50856) cloned into a synapsin promoter-containing AAV plasmid downstream from the calcium sensor GCaMP5G20. A piece of DNA encoding the P2A self-cleaving peptide sequence is inserted by PCR between GCaMP5G and cofilin-RFP during the preparation of the transfer plasmid to provide expression of both proteins from a single AAV transcript21.\nPrepare recombinant lentivirus vectors by co-transfection of transfer plasmid containing the gene or cDNA of interest and integration signals, along with a third-generation lentivirus packaging mixture that divides the viral gag, pol, rev, and vsv-g genes onto three separate plasmids22,23.",
    "For the transfer plasmid, use a single step cloning system24 to assemble the synapsin promoter and cofilin-R21Q-mRFP cDNA (from plasmid #51279) into pLKO.1-GFP (plasmid #30323), with the synapsin promoter and cofilin-R21Q-mRFP replacing the hPGK promoter and GFP cDNA, respectively.\nTransfect the final plasmid into HEK293T cells by calcium phosphate as previously described23.\nCollect medium from four 10 cm dishes, concentrate to 500 µL using 150K-cutoff centrifugal concentrators, and store the final lentivirus at -80 °C in small aliquots after quick freezing in liquid nitrogen. Thaw an aliquot only once for infecting cells.\nDetermine empirically the volume of each virus type prepared to achieve the degree of expression desired by setting up a number of different slice cultures to follow the expression of the transgenes after infection with various volumes of virus.\n\tNOTE: Typically, 1-10 µL of virus is used per slice.\n6. Slice Treatments\nInfecting slices with virus\nWorking in a biological safety cabinet approved for virus work at the biological safety level appropriate for the vector, mix an aliquot of the virus (usually 1-10 µL) with 0.8 mL of complete medium.\nAspirate the medium from the slice using a sterile Pasteur pipette into a collection trap containing bleach. A secondary trap is always used between the first trap and the vacuum source.\nReplace this medium with the virus-containing aliquot prepared above, return the culture tubes to a rack, and place in the incubator.\nAfter 2-5 days of incubating the slices with virus in the biological safety cabinet, remove the virus-containing medium with a sterile transfer pipette and place it into a bottle containing an approved antiviral agent to kill virus.\nStaining of neurons with vital dye",
    "Prepare and store aliquots of fluorescent neuronal vital dye25 by quick freezing 4 µL of aliquots in liquid nitrogen at a concentration of 100 µM and store these at -20 °C. Do not freeze/thaw the dye more than once.\nTo label neurons for visualization by fluorescence microscopy, thaw one aliquot of the neuronal vital dye and dilute to 4 mL in complete Neurobasal medium (final dye concentration is 100 nM).\nRemove the medium from slices by aspiration (or with a transfer pipette if the medium contains virus) and replace it with 0.8 mL of the medium containing 100 nM neuronal vital dye. Return the slices to the roller apparatus in the incubator.\nAfter incubating the slices for 2 h, aspirate the dye-containing medium and replace it with 0.8 mL of fresh complete medium in a biological safety cabinet.\n\t\tNOTE: Labeling of neurons in slices with vital dye requires several hours of incubation. The first images are usually taken 24 h after dye treatment. Although neurons are specifically labeled, there is background fluorescence that declines over 2-3 days to give better neuronal imaging. Intensity of the vital dye declines after 72 h.\nTo follow changes in slice morphology over time, relabel the slices every 7 days.\n7. Slice Imaging\nView slices on an inverted microscope. For brightest fluorescence imaging, at 24 h before imaging, exchange culture medium with complete Neurobasal A medium without the Phenol Red pH indicator.\n\tNOTE: For experiments reported here, slices are viewed on an inverted spinning disc confocal fluorescence microscope equipped with a linear encoded x, y stage with piezo z control and a sensitive high-resolution digital camera.",
    "Transfer the tube with the slice culture to be imaged from the roller tube apparatus to the custom-made tube holder (Figure 5A), which is placed in the stage adapter (Figure 5B), to keep the coverslip perpendicular to the objective and maintain the slice in the same orientation during repetitive imaging sessions over long intervals.\nPush the slider on the stage adapter tight against the tube to hold the tube in position (Figure 5B). Maintain slice temperature at 35 °C during imaging by use of heating strips and a thermoregulatory controller built into the custom-made stage adapter (Figure 5C).\n\tNOTE: Details of the tube holder, stage adapter, and heater can be accessed at: https://vpr.colostate.edu/min/custom-machining/roller-tube-holder/.\nUsing a low power (e.g., 4X) objective and bright field transillumination, focus on the photoetched grid pattern (Figure 6A) under the slice. For the initial imaging session, quickly scan around the slice to locate and record the number for the various regions where higher magnification imaging is desired (e.g., cornu ammonis (CA)1, CA3, dentate gyrus (DG), etc.).\nMove the stage to the first grid square containing a region of interest. Switch to the 20X air objective and locate a fiducial mark (e.g., tip of an etched number) (Figure 6B).\nSwitch to a higher power objective (40X or 60X), localize the fiducial mark, and then record the x and y position of the stage. Move the stage to find the field(s) of interest nearby and record their x and y offsets from the fiducial mark (Figure 6B, arrow). Repeat in other grid areas if desired.\n\tNOTE: These off-set positions from the fiducial mark allow consistent pinpointing of the same coverslip location when the slice is imaged, even though the original x, y setting of the fiducial mark changes when the tube or stage adapter are removed and replaced.",
    "Capture an image Z-stack within each selected field using either the microscope objective control or a piezo stage control, if available.\n\tNOTE: Image planes are usually obtained at intervals of 0.5 µm to 2 µm, depending on the size and desired resolution of the image features. Building a quality 3D image requires that image features extend over multiple planes of acquisition, and so to visualize smaller features, smaller intervals are required between planes.\nKeep the total imaging time for each slice as short as possible.\n\tNOTE: Most imaging sessions reported here were under 18 min/slice. However, we have imaged some slices ten or more times, and even as long as 40 min in a single session, without apparent harm in the long-term survival of the slice.\nSubscription Required.
