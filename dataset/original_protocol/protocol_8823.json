    "1. Neural Cell Harvesting\nAssessment by microscope:\n\t\nPrior to initiating an experiment, check the status of the culture with bright-field or phase contrast microscopy.\n\t\tNOTE: While primary neural tissue obtained from dissections is, in principle, equally amenable to flow cytometric analysis14,28, please note that the protocol’s focus is on cells obtained from in vitro neural cell systems.\nHarvesting cells7:\n\t\nGently wash the dish/flask of adherent cells with Mg2+/ Ca2+ free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at RT (e.g., 5 ml for T75 flask, 3 ml per well for 6-well plate, or 10 ml for 10 cm dish).\n\t\tNOTE: The PBS used throughout the protocol is Mg2+/ Ca2+ free.\n\t\t\nFor the video example, use a T75 flask of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells at 80% confluency. Apply additional washing steps in cases where considerable debris is present in the dish.\nConsider washes with serum albumin-containing PBS48, Percoll, or Ficoll49 centrifugation gradients and/or commercially available beads50,51. Removal of myelin and other lipid or other contaminants is critical, particularly when adult primary tissue sources are being used.\nAdd pre-warmed (37 °C) trypsin replacement at an appropriate volume that covers the entire surface of the tissue culture vessel.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, consider Accutase or other enzymatic digestion options. This critical step may negatively affect surface epitope expression (see 7).\nIncubate the dish/flask at 37 °C for 2 - 5 min (depending on the cell type) to allow cells to detach. Gently tap the tissue culture vessel or flush with a serological pipet to dislodge the cells. Avoid over digestion (as this can cause cell loss and clotting at later steps).\nQuench the trypsin replacement by adding twice the volume of flow buffer (2% FBS in PBS) and collect the cells in a 15 ml conical tube.",
    "Gently triturate the cell suspension using a microliter pipet (100 - 1,000 µl) or a 5 ml serological pipet to prepare a single cell suspension.\nCentrifuge the cells at 220 x g for 5 min at 25 °C. Carefully aspirate the supernatant leaving the pellet behind.\nRe-suspend the pellet in an appropriate volume of flow buffer, depending on the size of the pellet (e.g., for one confluent T75 flask of SH-SY5Y cells the typical yield is at least 10 x 106 cells, in which case the cells are resuspended in 5 ml of flow buffer).\n\t\tNOTE: If larger chunks or clotting are observed, filter through a 30 - 100 µm mesh.\nCell counting52:\n\t\nTransfer a small aliquot of the cell suspension to a microcentrifuge tube and dilute at a defined ratio in a volume of trypan blue or an alternative viability dye before transfer to a hemocytometer or automated cell counting system.\nDilute the cell suspension to a concentration of 1 x 106 viable cells/ml by adding the appropriate volume of flow buffer or PBS with 0.1% BSA (if proceeding with CFSE labeling).\n\t\tNOTE: Propidium iodide, 7-aminoactinomycin D, annexin V and commercially available fixable viability assay kits represent alternative options in order to assess the viability of cells. Also, apoptosis assays using caspase-3 fluorescence as described previously53 may be used. Fluorescent channels will be “occupied” by these reagents which may limit the options for subsequent steps if included in all samples.\n2. Intracellular Dye Labeling Using CFSE (Figure 3)\nDilute the CFSE to a desired stock concentration that can be easily used.\n\tNOTE: For these experiments a stock concentration of 0.01 mM was used. Determine the optimal working concentration of CFSE empirically.",
    "Add 10 µl of 0.01 mM CFSE solution per ml of cells (Section 1.3.2, concentration of 1 x 106 cells/ml in PBS + 0.1% BSA) for a final concentration of 0.1 µM. Briefly vortex to mix well.\n\tNOTE: CFSE concentrations used here are about ten-fold lower than the ones commonly applied in proliferation assays, hence cell toxicity of the dye is minimal. We do not observe negative effects on cell viability.\nIncubate for 5 min at RT with constant shaking (200 rpm). Protect from light.\nQuench the dye by adding 5 volumes of flow buffer to the tubes. Centrifuge at 94 x g for 5 min at RT.\nDiscard the supernatant leaving the pellet behind. Re-suspend the cells with 5 volumes of flow buffer.\nCentrifuge at 94 x g for 5 min at RT. Discard the supernatant and re-suspend the cells in flow buffer at a concentration of 1 x 106 cells/ml.\nAdd an equal number of unstained cells of interest to the stained cell suspension. Proceed to surface antigen staining protocol (Section 3).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52241/52241fig3highres.jpg\nFigure 3. Detection of differential CD surface antigen expression between two cell lines via CFSE dye labeling. SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells are pre-labeled with CFSE for subsequent identification in comparison to unlabeled BJ fibroblasts. Co-staining of the mixed sample (right panels) with surface markers CD24 or CD54 (both conjugated to APC) demonstrates that cell lines are easily distinguishable due to the CFSE staining (arrows = SH-SY5Y; arrowheads = BJ fibroblasts). The majority of SH-SY5Y cells express CD24 but not CD54 (ICAM-1). In contrast, BJ fibroblasts (CFSE-negative) are positive for CD54 but largely negative for CD24.

Selection of neural surface antigens. This table provides a list of surface epitopes found to be expressed by various neural cell types to exemplify the increasing panel of surface antigens used to characterize the neural lineage. Note that this selection is far from being complete and that most of these markers are also expressed by a range of other neural and non-neural cells. Consequently, combinations of several markers will be required to better define and isolate the indicated neural subsets.\nIncubate for 30 min on an orbital shaker (200 rpm) in the dark.\nFlow buffer wash",
    "Add 1 ml of flow buffer to the tubes. Centrifuge at 380 x g for 4 min at 4 °C.\nDiscard the supernatant leaving the pellet behind.\nRepeat the wash step again.\nAfter the second wash, decant the supernatant and re-suspend the cells in flow buffer to a final volume of 100 µl.\nUse sample for flow cytometric analysis. Alternatively, proceed with Section 4 and 5.\n\tNOTE: If cells are to be sorted and put back into culture post-FACS (i.e., viable cell suspension without fixation or permeabilization), apply aseptic techniques during the harvest, staining and analytical steps.\n4. Fixation and Permeabilization38\nFixation using paraformaldehyde (PFA):\n\t\nPrepare fixation buffer containing 2% PFA in PBS.\n\t\tNOTE: PFA is harmful to humans and the environment. Use appropriate personal protective equipment and discard waste in accordance with local regulations.\nAdd 500 µl of fixation buffer to 100 µl of cell suspension.\nIncubate the tubes at RT for 15 min on an orbital shaker (100 rpm) in the dark.\nPBS wash:\n\t\nAdd 1 ml of PBS to the tube.

Intracellular Antigen Staining38 (Figure 4)\nPreparation of primary antibody solutions:\n\t\nDilute the primary antibodies in dilution buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 10% serum (e.g., normal donkey or goat serum) and 0.5% Tween-20 in PBS.",
    "NOTE: Choose the serum to be used depending on the species the secondary antibodies were raised in.\nAlternatively, use Zenon fluorescein labeling of the primary antibody according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\n\t\t\nPrepare 1 µg of primary antibody in PBS at an appropriate dilution (total volume ≤ 20 µl).\nAdd 5 µl of Zenon fluorescein IgG labeling reagent (Component A) to the antibody solution.\nIncubate the mixture for 5 min at RT.\nAdd 5 µl of Zenon blocking reagent (Component B) to the reaction mixture.\nIncubate the mixture for 5 min at RT. Apply the antibody to the sample within 30 min.\nPrimary antibody staining:\n\t\nAdd 100 µl of the primary antibody solution to the cell pellet and gently triturate to mix.\nAlternatively, add Zenon fluorescein labeled antibody to the cell suspension at the appropriate dilution.\nIncubate the tubes at RT for 30 min on an orbital shaker (200 rpm), protected from light. Wash the cells once with PBS (as describes in Section 4.2) and remove the supernatant from the tubes completely, leaving only the pellet behind.\nSecondary antibody staining (not required for the Zenon fluorescein labeled antibodies):\n\t\nDilute the secondary antibodies in PBS at an appropriate concentration.\nAdd 100 µl of the secondary antibody solution to the cell pellet and gently triturate to mix. Incubate the tubes at RT for 30 min on a shaker (200 rpm) in the dark.\nWash the samples two times with PBS (as described in Section 4.2).\nWash once with flow buffer (see Section 3.5).\nRe-suspend the cells in approximately 150 µl of flow buffer and analyze on the flow cytometer.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52241/52241fig4highres.jpg",
    "Figure 4. Co-staining of surface and intracellular proteins. Flow cytometry data exemplifies a comparison between primary + secondary antibody-based versus Zenon fluorescein-based intracellular staining in combination with surface staining. Exclusive positivity on the y-axis (upper left quadrant) and the x-axis (lower right quadrant) shows cells stained for MAP2 and CD24, respectively. After co-staining, shared MAP2 and CD24 expression can be seen in the upper right quadrant (right panels). Comparison of using Alexa fluor 488 (top; AF488) versus Zenon fluorescein (bottom) for MAP2-labeling yields similar results.
