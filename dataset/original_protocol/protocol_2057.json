    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDigestion of thyroid tissues\nTiming: 1–2 h\nEstablish thyroid organoids starting from surgery specimens of thyroid cancer patients undergone to thyroidectomy.\nTake the surgical specimens (50–100 mg of tissue) in a 50 mL tube with 25 mL of DMEM PEN/STREP 10× on ice.\nPut fragments of the specimens in a 1.5 mL tube with 500 μL of DMEM medium without supplements and mince using a sterile scissors inside the vial (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1649-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. First steps of the digestion of thyroid tissues\n(A) The mincing of the specimens using a sterile scissors inside the vial.\n(B) Pellet after centrifugation of the specimens digested.\nDigestion step: transfer the minced tissue in a 15 mL tube and add 5–10 mL of DIGESTION MEDIUM, incubate the mixture for 30 min at 37°C with rotation.\nIn the meantime, working on ice, add 125 μL of 3D RGF-BME to each well in a sterile 96 well-plate with flat bottom, incubate the plate for 30 min at 37°C in the incubator (Debnath et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nAfter the digestion step, centrifuge cells in digestion medium at 1,000 rpm for 5′ and discard the supernatant (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). Resuspend cells in 2 mL of DMEM medium without supplements.\nPreparation of primary and organoid cultures\nTiming: 1 h\nThe cell suspension resulted in the step number 9 of the digestion phase is used to obtain both primary and organoid cultures.\nDivide the cell suspension resulted from digestion step into two parts, using two 15 mL tubes, transferring 1 mL of cells suspension in each tube. The cells will be used to obtain a primary culture and organoids respectively.",
    "Resuspend first half of the cells in 10 mL of CULTURE MEDIUM and plate it in 100 mm dish to obtain a primary culture. Incubate cells at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Replace the culture medium every 48 h.\nNote: store the discarded medium from primary culture (CONDITIONED MEDIUM) in 1 mL aliquots at −20°C.\nCount cells with the methods usually used in your laboratory.\nNote: Starting from a 50–100 mg specimen, we obtain usually among 1 × 105 and 1 × 106 cells/mL, we count cell with the hemocytometer.\nWorking on ice, resuspend the second part of the cells in ASSAY MEDIUM in order to dilute cells to 1 × 104 cells/mL and swirl to mix.\nNote: any unused 3D RGF-BME (both in the steps 8 and 13) can be stored at 2°C–8°C up to one week or stored in working aliquots at ≤ −20°C.\nAdd 175 μL of cell suspension to each well of the 96-well plate containing 3D RGF-BME prepared in step 7 of digestion of thyroid tissues[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1] section.\nIncubate the plate at 37° in an atmosphere of 5% CO2.\nEach day, observe cell growth and structure formation using an inverted microscope and put the plate back into the incubator (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1649-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. First step of organoid lines growth and confluence of particles\n(A) Some representative images of the growth of OrgT1 line, at 5× of magnification. The time points represented are after 5 days, 10 days, 20 days, and 60 days of culture.\n(B) Some representative images of the OrgT3 at low and high confluence of growth.\nLong-term culture in conditioned medium\nTiming: 1 week to 10 months",
    "The organoids can be cultured for long time replacing the medium every 4 days. When they reach higher confluence as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B, they need to be split into more than 1 well.\nEvery 4 days, carefully pipette off old medium using a sterile serological pipette and replace the culture medium with 200 μL of CONDITIONED MEDIUM, the medium from primary culture stored at −20°C in step 11 of preparation of primary and organoid cultures[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2] section.\nNote: There is no specific size that the organoids have to reach. It is mandatory that they grow for at least 10 days, when they show a more defined structure (as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], after 1 month of growth). When the desired size and quantity of organoids have been reached, the organoids can be trypsinized and collected in pellets or fixed on slides for molecular and morphological analyses, respectively.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1649-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Organoid line growth over the time\nSome representative images of the growth of OrgT2 line, at 10× of magnification. The time points represented are after 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 8 months. The reference bars correspond to 50 μm.\nSplit organoids\nTiming: 1 h\nWhen the organoid structures reach higher confluence (as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B), they need to be split into more than 1 well.\nPrepare the 96-well plate with fresh 3D BME-RGF as described in step 8 of digestion of thyroid tissues[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1] section.\nPipette off the medium from 96-well plate containing the organoids.\nAdd 125 μL of 0,05% trypsin EDTA, incubate the plate at 37°C in the cell’s incubator for 5 min and mix the solution using a 1,000 μL tips until 3D RGF-BME reach the liquid state.",
    "Dilute the mixture in 125 μL CULTURE MEDIUM and divide it into 3 wells of the 96-well plate with fresh 3D BME-RGF prepared in step 16."
