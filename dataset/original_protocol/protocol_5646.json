    "Preparation of islets for transplantationIsolation of pancreatic islet using the appropriate protocol (Graham et al., 2016)Briefly, sacrifice animal by cervical dislocation, open the mouse abdominal cavity and cut through the peritoneum. Place 3 ml of collagenase P into a 2 ml slip tip syringe with a 30 G needle. Perform the bile duct injection procedure and dissect the inflated pancreas, being careful not to cut the stomach, the intestines or other abdominal organs. Pour the inflated pancreases in a collection tube on ice. When all pancreata have been resected, incubate for 15 min at 37 °C in water-bath. Add ice-cold HBSS/Ca/HEPES as quick as possible to stop the digestion process. Disrupt the pancreases by vigorously hand shaking the tubes. Upon obtaining the digested tissue, the islets are separated by density gradient, recovered from the gradient interface, washed with RPMI 10% FBS and collected in a 50 ml Falcon tube containing 30 ml of RPMI 10% FBS. Note: RPMI with serum is demonstrated to maintain (or even augment) glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in murine islets (Andersson, 1978).Afterwards, 5 ml of islets is transferred into a Petri dish that is gently swirled to collect the islets at the center.Under an inverted microscope, healthy islets are picked with a P200 sterile pipette tip. Healthy islets have smooth borders in the absence of dark centers (Figure 1). Visual examination of the islets can provide basic information regarding health. Hand-picked healthy islets are then transferred into a new Petri dish containing 3 ml of fresh RPMI 10% FBS. Anticipate using one Petri dish for the totality of islets to be injected to one mouse. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180226/20180226220814_5674.jpgFigure 1.

Scale bars represent 150 µm.Isolated islets are highly stressed due to physical and chemical processing.",
    "To improve overall islet viability, islets cultured in Petri dishes are rested overnight in an incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. This allows a better discrimination between dead and alive islets as well as an optimum islets recovery. In case transplantation needs to be performed the same day of islet collection, due to experimental requirements, healthy islets are placed directly into a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube with 1 ml of sterile RPMI 10% FBS and kept on ice until transplantation. The following day islets are checked under the microscope to confirm viability. If needed, healthy islets are re-collected, leaving behind dead cells. Healthy islets are then transferred from each Petri dish into a sterile 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube containing 1 ml of fresh sterile RPMI 10% FBS (Figure 2). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180226/20180226220850_2960.jpgFigure 2. Collection and preparation of pancreatic islets. Healthy pancreatic islets transferred into a Petri dish are collected with a P200 (A) and transferred into a sterile 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube (B).The number of hand-picked islets to be transplanted under the kidney capsule varies from 300 to 600 depending on the experimental conditions required or the mouse strain used (e.g., chemically-induced or spontaneous diabetes, C57BL/6 or NOD, transgenic or knockout) (Battaglia et al., 2006; Gagliani et al., 2011 and 2015; Fousteri et al., 2015a and 2015b) (see Table 1).Table 1. Number of pancreatic islets required to reach normoglycemia in different mouse modelsimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180226/20180226221024_8092.jpgTransplantation under the kidney capsuleAll instruments and reagents used must be sterile. Ideal transplant recipients should be between 6 to 10 weeks old. The recipient mouse is anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of a weight-adjusted dose of avertin (240 mg/kg). Note: Avertin is a quick-acting, non-pharmaceutical grade anesthetic that is used for short duration surgical procedures in mice.",
    "It provides rapid and deep anesthesia, followed by fast and full postoperative recovery. This agent is listed on an approved Animal Protocol of the Italian Ministry of Health and procedures are performed by appropriately trained personnel. All guidelines for preparation and storage of avertin are followed. The level of anesthesia can be tested by pinching the animal’s toes. The mouse’s eyes are kept continuously humid with a physiologic saline solution, 0.9 % NaCl until the mouse awakens to prevent corneal drying. When anesthesia takes effect, islets are prepared for transplantation. All the islets sedimented (by gravity effect) in the 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube are transferred into a 25 μl Hamilton syringe connected to a P200 tip using the screw mechanism that allows for a slow less strenuous aspiration. Place a silicone tube adapter over the syringe tip. Insert PE50 tubing into the silicone adapter. Turn the Hamilton syringe the opposite site to let the islets into the PE 50 tube. Be careful to not lose the islets from the edge of the tip (Video 1 and Figure 3). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180226/20180226221219_5013.jpgFigure 3.

Preparation of islets for transplantation. Pancreatic islets are collected into a P200 tip and transferred into the PE50 tubing by slowly turned the Hamilton syringe.While the mouse is under anesthesia, the transplant area is shaved with the electric shears and disinfected with betadine (Video 2). <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Mouse preparation for islet transplantation. The transplant area is disinfected and the mouse’s eyes are kept humid.Localize the kidney using your fingers and make a 1-1.5 cm incision in the skin on the left back side to visualize the peritoneum.",
    "Make the 0.5-1 cm incision in the peritoneum to expose the kidney. Slight pressure is applied to both sides of the incision, to allow the kidney to slide out of the abdominal cavity. Keep the surface of the exposed kidney wet with sterile saline using soaked cotton-tipped applicator. Repeat wetting as many times as necessary to prevent the kidney capsule from drying out (Video 3). <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 3. Incision and kidney exposure. A small incision is made in the skin and in the peritoneum exposing the kidney.Make a small scratch on the right flank of the kidney capsule using a syringe 25 gauge needle, to allow the PE50 filled with islets and attached to a Hamilton syringe to be inserted. Reach the posterior end of the capsule and carefully create some space by moving the PE50 tube and slowly inject the islets. Once all islets are injected, carefully remove the PE50 tube, dry the area and cauterize.Note: Is highly recommended to use new PE50 tubes for each set of islets to be transplanted to avoid blood clotting.

Pancreatic islets are transplanted under the kidney capsule.The kidney is then placed back into the cavity and residual blood is cleaned with physiological solution. Both incisions (peritoneum and skin) are sutured with 3 or 4 stitches based on the size of the incision (Video 5 and Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180226/20180226221433_0881.jpgFigure 5.

Subcutaneous injection of ketoprofen is made and the mice are placed on a heating pad until are active.",
    "The mice are treated with ketoprofen (5 mg/kg) subcutaneously and placed on a heating pad. Animals should be kept warm until they recover from anesthesia and must be monitored until maintaining upright posture and walking normally. Blood glucose levels usually normalize 24 h after the procedure."
