    "Paraffin embedded 5 µm tissue sections were deparaffinized: 1 h on 58 °C, 5 x 6 min in xylene, 4 x 3 min in 100% (v/v) ethanol, 2 min in 96% (v/v) ethanol, 2 min in 80% (v/v) ethanol and 2 min in aqua dest.    Tissue sections were incubated for 1.5 min with crystal violet staining reagent and washed for 30 sec under running tap water.    The slide was flooded with Gram's iodine for 3 min followed by a second washing step for 20 sec with tap water.    The slide was flooded with decolorizing agent for 20 sec and once again washed for 20 sec under tap water.    The counterstain was safranin (1 min) which was followed by a last washing step under tap water."
