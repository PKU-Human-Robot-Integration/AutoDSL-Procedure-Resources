    "Using a brain stereotaxic atlas as a guide (e.g., Allen Brain Atlas http://mouse.brain-map.org/static/atlas[href=http://mouse.brain-map.org/static/atlas]) under a stereomicroscope cut general area from the intact brain, fixed with at least 2% PFA and variable proportion of glutaraldehyde (at least 0.1% up to as much as 2%). Continue to cut rodent brain under the stereomicroscope into a hemisphere wedge including the hippocampus.Mount the brain sample on vibratome plate with any type of cyanoacrylate superglue (Figure 1). Use a small drop (~50 μl) of superglue only, and spread it with a plastic pipette tip, so it covers the same area as the size of the brain block. Simply put the brain chunk onto the glue-covered area (do not apply pressure, nor let the brain dry out!). Once the tissue block is on the glued plate, move it quickly into the 0.1 M PB solution-filled chamber of the vibratome. The glue will rapidly polymerize, and sectioning can be started immediately.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180718/20180718210302_3039.jpgFigure 1. Coronal brain hemisphere wedge mounted on vibratome plate with superglueCut 50-90 µm thin free-floating sections with a vibratome (see Video 1). The chamber of the vibratome should be filled with 0.1 M PB, so the brain sample submerges beneath the surface of the liquid. The settings of the vibratome should be optimized to the actual machine in use, and are highly dependent on the condition of the tissue. For robustly fixed material, higher speed and lower frequency should be used. For weakly fixed material, lower cutting speed and higher frequency may be optimal. <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Vibrating blade microtome sectioning brain block.

    "Collect free-floating sections in glass vials (using a round bristle paint brush) and incubate them on a mildly moving shaker in the following solutions:Incubate for 2 x 5 min in 0.1 M PB, pH 7.4.Incubate for 1 h in 1% Osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M PB, pH 7.4 (toxic, wear protective clothing, under a hood).Incubate for 2 x 5 min in 0.1 M PB, pH 7.4 (Stopping point, the sample can be stored in a refrigerator overnight at this step).Incubate for 5 min in 30% ethanol.Incubate for 5 min in 50% ethanol.Incubate for 30 min in 1% Uranyl acetate in 70% ethanol. Notes: This incubation step (Step 4f) is light-sensitive; the solution should be protected from light by wrapping with aluminum foil. Uranyl acetate is toxic. Wear protective clothing, work under fume hood, and dispose of according to local regulations. Incubate for 5 min in 80% ethanol.Incubate for 5 min in 95% ethanol.Incubate for 2 x 5 min in 100% ethanol.Incubate for 5 min in 1:1 100% ethanol/Propylene oxide.Incubate for 2 x 5 min in 100% Propylene oxide.Incubate for 30 min in 1:1 Propylene oxide/ResinIncubate for 30 min in 1:3 Propylene oxide/Resin.Incubate for 2 x 1 h in resin (Stopping point, the sample can be stored in a refrigerator overnight in either resin step).Waferize: create a multi-layered sandwich composed of 5 layers: 1) Glass slide; 2) A rectangular ACLAR® film, that is 1-2 mm bigger in each direction, than the glass slide (this can be cut manually with scissors from the Letter or A4-sized film); 3) The osmicated, resin infiltrated sections can be directly transferred onto the ACLAR® film with a bit of extra resin.",
    "Once all the sections are arranged on the film; 4) Cover them with another ACLAR® film, same size as the one beneath the tissue samples, avoid the formation of bubbles; 5) Scratch the name/ID of your samples onto the glass slide that covers the entire ‘wafer’ with a diamond point glass engraving pen and polymerize in an appropriate thermostat at 60 °C for 36-48 h.After cured, remove upper glass slide and upper ACLAR® film, cut out the area of interest with No. 11 scalpel blade (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180718/20180718210420_3919.jpgFigure 2.

Scale bar = 1 mm.Mount on a resin block with super glue.Cut 50-70 nm thin ultrathin sections with an ultramicrotome (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180718/20180718210508_8970.jpgFigure 3. Image showing floating 50-70 nm ultrathin CA1 sections forming a ribbon in the distilled-water filled tank of a DIATOME ultra 45° 1.5 mm diamond knife (blue) Mount sections on e.g., 300 mesh copper grids with the help of a perfect loop. See details at the vendor’s website (Perfect Loop for Ultra Thin sections[href=https://www.emsdiasum.com/microscopy/products/preparation/ultramicrotomy.aspx]).Collect grids into a storage box.Use Leica’s Ultrostain II lead citrate solution to make ~50 μl droplets in a Petri dish covered by Parafilm, and incubate the grids within these droplets for 1 min. Eliminate traces of the contrasting lead solution by quickly (and gently) moving the grids in three consecutive dH2O filled glass vial.Examine sections with a transmission electron microscope."
