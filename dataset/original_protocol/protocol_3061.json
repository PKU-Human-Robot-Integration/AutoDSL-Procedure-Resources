    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nLiver preparation before perfusion\nTiming: 30–40 min\nTiming: 2–3 h (for step 18a)\nTiming: 2–3 h (for step 18b)\nTiming: 30 min for plating, 2–12 h for incubation, and 30 min for media change (for step 19a)\nTiming: 30 min for plating, 2–3 weeks for cells to reach 90% confluence (for step 19b).\nTiming: 1 h to prepare for control-rate step down with 1–2 h in freezer (for step 19c).\nCritical: All liver tissues are obtained in accordance with federal, state, and institutional regulations. Once the donor liver is transferred into the lab, all procedures are then performed in a biological safety cabinet (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A–2C). PPE, shoes cover, gloves and bouffant cap are required.\nTurn on biological safety cabinets and run for 10 min before using. Remove all materials and equipment from the cabinet. Clean the interior surfaces of the cabinet with an appropriate disinfectant, following the manufacturer’s instructions. Turn on biological safety cabinets and run for 10–30 min before using to purge any remaining contaminants from the air.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2806-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Isolation room images and workflow\n(A) Room images and workflow. Moving from left to right, the images depict the workflow of the cell isolation lab. The cell culture room (on the far right) is kept under the most strict and sterile condition to avoid possible contamination.\n(B and C) Images of normal (B) and cirrhotic (C) livers with the gallbladder attached.\nPlace peristaltic pump and filled water bath into the biological safety cabinet.\nTurn on water bath and warm to 39°C.\nPrepare perfusion solutions and place them in the water bath to warm up 20 min before starting the perfusion.",
    "Critical: The required volumes of solutions depend on the size of the liver. Dependent on the flow rate, the max flow rate used for 1 perfusion tubing/lobe is 30 mL/min. Only one tubing is usually used for perfusion of the left lobe at the perfusion rate of 30 mL/min for 20 min for max volume of 600 mL.\nLoad perfusion tubing into the peristaltic pump, with great care to maintain sterility, and place all ends into the Buffer A solution bottle.\nTurn on the pump to prime the tubing and allow the solution to circulate continuously.\nCover a pan of ice with a plastic bag and place it into a second biological safety cabinet.\nPlace a sterile field over the ice pan and then place the liver on top of the sterile field.\nPlace a second sterile field next to the ice pan with all surgical instruments and needed supplies opened and placed on the sterile field aseptically.\nDon sterile gloves, pick-up the liver and examine for any lacerations, bruising, and remarkable abnormalities.\nCritical: If gall bladder is still attached, use a scalpel to remove it (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Also, remove excess fat, muscle, and diaphragmatic tissues from the liver (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nResect the tissue into three pieces as shown in (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2806-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Overview of the human parenchymal and non-parenchymal isolation procedure\n(A) Resection of liver into 3 lobes (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]) and experimental setup.\n(B) Suturing the left and right lobes (Methods videos S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2], S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3], S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4], and S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5]), connection to pump, sequential perfusion with buffer A containing EGTA, buffer B with pronase and buffer C with collagenase solutions.\n(C) The digested liver is dissociated and filtered through 3 layers of nylon mesh (Methods video S6[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc6]).\n(D) Separation of hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells.",
    "(E) Percoll gradient centrifugation for hepatocyte isolation.\n(F) Wash hepatocytes to prepare for cryopreservation.\n(G) Culture and cryopreservation of hepatocytes.\n(H) Cells are centrifuged, and the pellet is washed with GBSS-B buffer.\n(I) Nycodenz gradient centrifugation, the HSCs are collected by removing the cell layer from the gradient interface, washed then followed by cryopreservation or culture.\nCritical: Use left lobe for hepatocyte isolation, use central lobe for snap frozen tissue and paraffin blocks, and use right lobe for non-parenchymal cell (hepatic stellate cell, Kupffer cell and endothelial cell) isolation.\nInsert barbed catheters into the major portal and/or hepatic vessels but do not secure.\nConnect a 60 mL syringe, filled with cold EMEM medium to the catheters, flush the liver tissue with EMEM medium to determine which vessels provide the most uniform perfusion of the liver, and to remove the residual blood (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nCritical: Multiple vessels can be used but use as few vessels as possible while achieving maximal inflation of liver.\nSecure the catheters into the selected vessels.\nNote: For this step, barbed luer adaptors can also be used to better secure the tubing in the vessel.\nPlace 6–7 loose loop stiches through the blood vessel wall opening.\nPlace the catheter (or luer adaptor) inside the vessel and tighten the suture around the blood vessel.\nAttach the tubing to the catheter.\nPlace multiple loops of suture, tightening with a knot each time for the final securing of the perfusion tubing.\nSeal the cut surface of the liver tissue with sutures (size 2-0) or surgical grade glue.\nNote: The cut surface must be sealed to achieve full inflation of the liver (Methods videos S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3] and S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4])\nCritical: All remaining major vessels on the cut surfaces must be closed with sutures or surgical grade glue.",
    "Flush the liver tissue again using the syringe filled with cold EMEM to test for any major leaks from the liver.\nCritical: Close any leaks with glue or sutures (Methods videos S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3] and S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\nPlace liver tissue with catheters in a sterile plastic bag. Weigh the liver tissue with the bag closed.\nPlace the bag containing the tissue into the 39°C water bath (Methods video S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5]), connect to the peristaltic pump with flow rate 20–30 mL/min and perfuse the tissue with Buffer A for 10–15 min (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nCritical: EGTA chelates calcium that leads to the separation of cell junctions and helps to remove any residual blood. Flow rate is based on the liver tissue size and number of catheters. Left lobe usually needs 500–600 mL of each perfusion buffer for complete digestion.\nNote: To ensure constant temperature during digestion, the liver lobe should be placed in a plastic bag and submerged in the water bath alongside the perfusion solutions (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). A key step in the procedure is successful suturing and stabilization of the perfusion setup to avoid dislocation of the perfusion tubing during the perfusion (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B, and Methods videos S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1], S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2], and S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]). Inflation of the whole liver lobe indicates successful insertion of tubing after beginning perfusion with buffer A",
    "Note: After perfusion with buffer A, vessels of the liver lobe should be a light brown color due to the EGTA chelating the remaining blood. This step helps to avoid contamination with red blood cells and clotting of hepatic vessels, which may result in incomplete perfusion and digestion. Aspirating buffer A from the bag before changing to the next buffer. Stop the pump while changing between buffers to prevent air. After perfusion with buffer B and/or C, the liver tissue starts fracturing under the capsule. The perfusion should be terminated after separation of liver tissue from the capsule is observed (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nChoose from the following options, depending on the type of cells to be isolated. Human hepatocytes are processed using option a. For non-parenchymal cells follow option b.\nParenchymal cell isolation\nNote: For parenchymal cell isolation, it is important to calculate the proper Percoll concentration to be used depending on the pathology of the liver to ensure adequate quantities of live cells are collected (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D). When performing the density gradient centrifugation, it is important to proceed with the break off to avoid contamination of live cells with dead cells. While washing the parenchymal cell population, the cell pellet must be resuspended gently (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E–3G).\nPerfuse the liver tissue with Buffer B for 15–20 min.\nCritical: Stop when liver tissue fractures and separates from the liver capsule.\nTransfer the liver from the plastic bag into a sterile container containing pre-warmed (37°C) DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 25 mM HEPES, 100 nM Dexamethasone, 1× ITS (Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium), 1% Pen/Strep.\nDissociate digested liver tissue from the liver capsule with sterile scissors or by sterile gloved hand to release hepatocytes.\nFilter cell suspension through sterile three-layer nylon mesh-covered funnels to remove cellular debris and clumps of undigested tissue.",
    "Critical: Three-layer nylon mesh from inside to outside size 500 μm, 250 μm, 85 μm, and must be autoclaved before use. Repeat Step 18a(iv) as many times as needed to obtain the maximum number of cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nNote: After the digestion, the liver is carefully removed and minced under sterile conditions (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). The liver cell suspension is then filtered through a 3-layer nylon mesh 500, 250 and 85 μm (outside to inside) to separate undigested tissue remnants, and is washed with warm supplemented DMEM (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C and Methods video S6[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc6]). The final step of the isolation procedure is a density gradient centrifugation including collection and counting of non-parenchymal and parenchymal cell types.\nCount cells using a hemocytometer and determine number of viable cells and yield with trypan blue staining.\nTransfer cell solution to 225 mL conical tubes and top with warmed (37°C) DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 25 mM HEPES, 100 nM Dexamethasone, 1× ITS (Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium), 1% Pen/Strep.\nCritical: A maximum of 1 billion hepatocytes should be added per 225 mL conical tube.\nPerform low speed centrifugation at 60–80 g for 5 min at 4°C to isolate hepatocytes from other cell types in the suspension (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nWhile waiting during the centrifugation step, weigh the bag with catheters and subtract from the previous weight in step 16 to determine the true liver weight.\nAfter centrifugation is complete, aspirate the supernatant leaving the hepatocyte pellets.\nResuspend the pellets in the Percoll gradient solution, and centrifuge at 100 g for 10 min at 4°C!\nCritical: Brake off! (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E)\nCritical: When resuspending hepatocyte pellet, do not use a serological pipette. Resuspend the pellet gently by swirling the centrifuge tube with approximately 50–100 mL of media.",
    "Following gradient centrifugation, aspirate the supernatant and wash hepatocyte pellet by gently resuspending in pre-warmed (37°C, 40 mL) DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 25 mM HEPES, 100 nM Dexamethasone, 1× ITS (Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium), 1% Pen/Strep. Plating conditions and cell density are described in the cell culture section.\nCentrifuge 60–80 g for 5 min at 4°C (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F).\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in a small volume of pre-warmed (37°C) DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 25 mM HEPES, 100 nM Dexamethasone, 1× ITS (Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium) 1% Pen/Strep.\nCheck final viability of isolated hepatocytes and cell number. Hepatocytes can now be plated on Collagen pre-coated plates 18b. Alternatively, hepatocytes can be cryopreserved, see 19c (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G).\nNon-parenchymal cell isolation\nNote: For non-parenchymal cell isolation, after resuspending the liver cell pellet with density gradient medium, it is important to add the cell mixture very slowly on top of the Nycodenz gradient solution, and subsequently adding the density gradient-free medium on top (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]H and 3I).\nSimilarly, it is important to centrifuge the gradient with the brake off so that the Kupffer Cell+ liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC)-containing layer on the bottom gradient and the HSC-containing layer on top of the gradient are not disrupted (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]I). After collecting HSCs and Kupffer Cell+LSEC fraction, cells are washed separately. Following final washes (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]H and 3I), the purity of each fraction can be immediately assessed using trypan blue staining and calculated as percent of viable (trypan blue negative) vs. damaged (trypan blue positive) cells.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nPerfuse the liver with Buffer C for 15–20 min.\nPerfuse the liver with Buffer D for 15–20 min.\nStop the perfusion when the liver tissue begins to show fractures and separation from the liver capsule (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).",
    "Critical: Adjust digestion time to the point of full digestion of the liver tissue but not further.\nRemove the liver tissue from the plastic bag and place in a sterile plastic beaker containing ice-cold EMEM. Then gently cut with sterile scissors to release cells.\nFilter the cell suspension through sterile three-layer nylon mesh-covered funnels to remove cellular debris and clumps of undigested tissues.\nCritical: Three-layer nylon mesh from inside to outside size 500 μm, 250 μm, 85 μm, and must be autoclaved before use. Repeat this step as many times as needed to obtain the maximum number of cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nTransfer filtered NPC suspension into 50 mL conical tubes. Remove hepatocytes from the other cell types in the suspension by low-speed centrifugation at 60–80 g for 5 min at 4°C (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nCritical: Centrifugation speed depends on the fat content of the contaminating hepatocytes. Fattier liver needs higher centrifugation speed.\nWhile waiting during the centrifugation step, weigh the bag with catheters and subtract from the previous weight in step 16 to determine the true liver weight.\nDecant the supernatant and centrifuge at 935 g for 8 min at 18°C to collect total NPCs (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]H).\nResuspend each pellet in 10 mL EMEM, and bring each tube up to 50 mL with EMEM. Spin again at 700 g for 8 min (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]I).\nDiscard supernatant, add 10 mL GBSS/B to resuspend the pellet, add 15 mL Nycodenz I, and bring the volume to 50 mL with GBSS/B. Mix well by inversion. This cell suspension will be used in the next step (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]I).\nCritical: Nycodenz I concentration must be adjusted based on the fat content in the liver. This is a critical step; the final concentration should be 10.4%–11%.",
    "Layer 10 mL Nycodenz II on the bottom of 50 mL tube. Then, layer 30 mL cell mixture from step 18b(x). Finally, slowly layer another 10 mL of GBSS/B onto the cell mixture using a 20 mL syringe with 19-gauge needle held against the inside of the tube wall to avoid mixing the layers. Combine the remaining 20 mL of cell mixture from step 18b(x) to repeat the procedure in step 18b(xi). Centrifuge 2000 g for 20 min at 4°C (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]I).\nCritical: Centrifugation without brake is critical.\nUnder the top layer of clear GBSS/B solution is a white layer. This layer contains enriched hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Collect this layer by carefully inserting a pipet through the clear GBSS/B layer, and transferring the HSC layer to new 50 mL tubes (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]I).\nThe second layer contains LEC and myeloid cells (Kupffer cells (KC) and bone-marrow derived myeloid cells). Remove enough of the remaining top solution to allow to safely collect the second layer with pipet. Collect this layer and transfer to new 50 mL tubes (for MACS selection). For myeloid cell purification, follow Miltenyi Biotec CD11b+ MicroBeads protocol. For LSEC purification, Miltenyi Biotec CD146+ Microbeads followed by Miltenyi Biotec CD31+ MicroBeads according to the vendor protocol.\nAdd 40 mL of GBSS/B to wash cells and centrifuge 935 g for 8 min at 18°C\nRepeat step 18b(xiv) but centrifuge 700 g for 8 min at 18°C\nProceed to applications.\nProceed with option a to culture hepatocytes, option b to culture hepatic stellate cells, and option C to cryopreserve hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells.\nCulturing hepatocytes\nCount cells using a hemocytometer and stain with trypan blue to determine the number of viable cells.",
    "Plate hepatocytes (0.5 × 106/mL) on Collagen coated plates and allow to attach for 2–12 h in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator.\nChange media to pre-warmed (37°C) DMEM supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, 100 nM Dexamethasone, 1× ITS (Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium), 1% Pen/Strep.\nAlternatively, if hepatocytes are used for cryopreservation as described in 19c, allow remaining hepatocyte stock to settle at 4°C for 1–2 h for cryopreservation.\nCulturing hepatic stellate cells (HSCs)\nPerform cell count.\nCulture 0.5 × 106 hepatic stellate cells with DMEM+10%FBS+1%AA in 10 cm dish.\nChange media (DMEM+10%FBS+1%AA) every 3–4 days until cells are 90% confluent. At this point HSCs should be trypsinized, split, and further cultured, or cryopreserved.\nCryopreservation of hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells\nCount cells using a hemacytometer.\nResuspend cell pellet in appropriate freezing medium∗ based on cell type.\nCritical: Hepatocyte Freezing Medium: CS10 + 100 mM Fructose. Hepatic stellate cell Freezing Medium: CELLBANKER® 1.\nFor Hepatocytes, aliquot 2 mL of cell suspension per freezing tube. Cell number per tube is 1.2 × 107.\nFor hepatic stellate cells, aliquot 1 mL of cell suspension per freezing tube. Cell number per tube is 1.0 × 106.\nPlace tubes with cell suspension in Control-rate step down Freezer.\nStart step down Program, and set the starting temperature to be 4°C.\nStep down Program\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2806_7.csv\nS = Sample Probe Temperature\nC = Chamber Probe Temperature\nC/m = Degrees Celsius per Minute\nThis program is from the CryoMed controlled-rate freezer preset program 1, which is commonly used for 2.0 mL sample size according to the instruction of CryoMed controlled-rate freezer.\nTransfer tubes into liquid nitrogen for long-term storage (vapor phase only).",
    "Note: HSCs can be identified by expression of Vitamin A (which is rapidly photobleached by the UV light) using fluorescent microscopy and immunocytochemistry for expression of GFAP and αSMA (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] qRT-PCR is another method which provides a sensitive assessment of contamination with specific cell types.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2806-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.
