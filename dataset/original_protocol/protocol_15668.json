    "All experiments in this study were performed in compliance with the Wayne State University and Detroit Medical Center Institutional Review Boards (IRB) under an approved protocol for the natural history of individuals with peripheral neuropathies. Informed consent was obtained from all human participants.\n1. Instrumental setup\nEnter the patient's name or other identifiers as needed to organize the captured images.\nSanitize the ultrasound probe (see Table of Materials) and apply ample ultrasound gel to the head of the transducer before imaging.\nSet the capture frequency to the highest frequency allowed by the ultrasound machine that does not require further image compounding or contrast.\n\tNOTE: For the present study, 20 MHz was used.\nSet the total imaging or screen depth to 1 cm, with two focal positions as superficial as possible.\n\tâ€‹NOTE: These depth and focal locations allow imaging of all the palmar and digital divisions of the median and ulnar nerves in the hand. Once determined by the examiner's preference, a consistent gain and grey map is recommended for the reproducibility of the measurements.\n2. Patient preparation\nNOTE: The patient inclusion criterion for inherited peripheral neuropathy was a confirmed mutation in a gene known to cause inherited peripheral neuropathy (please see the representative results section), with no exclusion criteria. For controls, the inclusion criterion was a normal result from electrodiagnostic testing of the upper extremities. Control exclusion criteria included a history or current diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction, any known vitamin abnormalities, previous bariatric surgery, metabolic syndrome, a body mass index greater than 29, a history of traumatic nerve injury, or a history of large or small fiber peripheral neuropathy.\nPlace the patient in a supine position with the elbow extended and the wrist supinated such that the dorsal surface of the forearm is resting comfortably on the table.",
    "NOTE: Before positioning, examine the hand and arm that will be evaluated as any wounds, rashes, or skin irritation near or over the areas to be imaged are relative contraindications and may preclude ultrasound imaging.\nExtend the patient's wrist and metacarpals so that the fingernails contact the table's surface. Allow the thumb to be slightly adducted and flexed for comfort.\n3. Ultrasound examination\nNOTE: There are four common palmar branches of the median nerve and two common palmar branches of the ulnar nerve13. Each digit has a medial and lateral digital branch, with digits 1-3 being purely median innervated and digit 5 being purely ulnar innervated. Digit 4 is dually innervated by the median nerve on the lateral surface and the ulnar nerve on the medial surface. This protocol concentrates on imaging the median common palmar nerve to digit 2, the lateral digital branch to digit 2, the ulnar common palmar branch to digit 5, and the medial branch to digit 5.\nStart by identifying the median common palmar branch to digit 2 using the lateral transverse flexor palmar crease as the landmark (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: The median common palmar branch to digit 2 and the ulnar common palmar branch to digit 5 are significantly larger than the accompanying blood vessels when compared to the digital nerves. Thus, identifying these nerves first can assist with identification in more distal branches, which are more similar in cross-sectional area to the blood vessels.\nPlace the transducer proximal to the radial flexor palmar crease (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: In the present study, individuals without a radial flexor palmar crease were not encountered. However, in the case of an absent palmar crease, place the transducer 2 cm proximal to the base of the second metacarpal.",
    "Hold the transducer perpendicular to the expected course of the nerve with as little pressure as possible while still ensuring complete contact with the transducer and skin.\n\tNOTE: Given the superficial location of the palmar and digital branches, they are susceptible to pressure distortions from the transducer.\nAdjust the angle of the transducer such that the smallest cross-sectional area with a uniform epineurium is identified. This technique lessens the likelihood of out-of-plane imaging, which can alter results.\nOptimize the image by making gentle back and forth movements of the transducer to minimize anisotropy of the nerve.\n\tNOTE: Anistrophy refers to the variance in the reflected ultrasound waveforms based on the angle of the transducer17. Adjusting the transmitted wave angle creates reflective waveforms that are out of plane and not received by the ultrasound transducer, leading to hypoechogenicity (or an increase in the black signal) of a structure. Nerves have relatively low anisotropy, meaning significant angle changes are required to create hypoechogenicity of the nerve. In comparison, muscles and tendons have relatively high anisotropy. By performing small back and forth motions with the transducer, the angular limits in which anisotropy arises can help identify the proper plane for nerve imaging18.\nIf possible, utilize Power Doppler imaging (PDI, see Table of Materials) to identify any blood vessels nearby (perform at all locations).\nOnce optimized, capture the image at this location. Mark the nerve within the ultrasound system prior to saving so that the nerve can be located for further measurement. Label the image with the nerve name, location, and side.",
    "Next, image the lateral digital branch of digit 2 at the metacarpophalangeal joint by advancing the transducer distally toward the end of the digit 2. Then, stop the transducer just distal and lateral to the center of the flexor crease of the second metacarpophalangeal joint.\nOnce optimized, capture the image at this location. Mark the nerve within the ultrasound system before saving so that the nerve can be located for further measurement. Label the image with the nerve name, location, and side.\nTo evaluate for focal pathologies or non-uniform cross-sectional enlargements of the palmar or digital branches to digit 2, advance the transducer distally toward the end of the digit 2.\n\tNOTE: Digital nerves can be adequately visualized within 1.5-2 cm proximal to the distal interphalangeal joint (DIP).\nThen, from the most distal point from which the branch can be visualized, follow the nerve proximally to the common median nerve just distal to the carpal tunnel.\nNext, image the ulnar common palmar branch to digit 5 by identifying the ulnar transverse palmar crease (Figure 1).\nPlace the transducer perpendicular to the expected course of the nerve and adjust the imaging as described in steps 3.3.-3.6.\nOnce optimized, capture the image at this location. Mark the nerve within the ultrasound system prior to saving so that the nerve can be located for further measurement. Label the image with the nerve name, location, and side.\nNext, image the medial branch at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint by advancing the transducer toward the end of the digit 5, stopping just distal to the flexor crease of the MCP.\nOptimize the image as previously mentioned in steps 3.3.-3.6.",
    "Once optimized, capture the image at this location. Mark the nerve within the ultrasound system prior to saving so that the nerve can be located for further measurement. Label the image with the nerve name, location, and side.\nEvaluate for focal or segmental cross-sectional abnormalities along digit 5. By identifying the distal-most location, visualize the nerve and scan proximally back to Guyon's canal.\n\tNOTE: Guyon's canal, also known as the ulnar canal or tunnel, is located on the medial aspect of the hand/wrist where the ulnar nerve and artery pass. The borders of Guyon's canal include the superficial carpal ligament superiorly, the flexor retinaculum and hypothenar muscles inferiorly, the pisiform and pisohamate ligament medially, and the hook of hamate laterally19.\nPerform all measurements on both sides.\n\tNOTE: For the present study, for individuals with a BMI of less than 33, imaging of the entire course of the median and ulnar nerve back into the brachial plexus was possible with the transducer used here. Although this protocol only focuses on a limited number of nerves, in the case of focal or traumatic neuropathies (for which the evaluation of nerves is not shown in this protocol), it is recommended to use the distal heads of the metacarpals as a starting point for tracing and evaluating other digital and palmar nerves.\nSave all the images and export them to a mass storage device. If using ImageJ, export the images as .jpg files.\n4. Measuring cross-sectional area\nNOTE: ImageJ, an open-source image processing software (see Table of Materials), was utilized for the present study, and the steps below are adapted for this software.\nOpen ImageJ software.\nSelect File in the program interface and click on Open. Navigate to the directory where the ultrasound images are stored.",
    "Select the .jpg associated with the nerve to be measured.\nSet the scale for the image by selecting the line tool and using the scale bar on the original ultrasound image to draw a 1 cm straight line. Click on Analyze and choose Set Scale.\n\tNOTE: The distance in pixels is automatically calculated from the 1 cm line and is auto-populated in the first box. To output measurements in millimeters squared (mm2), change the known distance to 10. Close the set scale box.\nUse the freehand selection tool to outline the nerve at the border of the epineurium and surrounding tissues (Figure 2, yellow line).\n\tNOTE: The zoom function can be used in ImageJ to determine the exact pixels separating the epineurium from the surrounding structures for more precise measurements.\nMeasure the cross-sectional area by clicking on Analyze and choosing Measure.\nSubscription Required.
