    "Neuronal cells preparation and freezing procedureEuthanize the pregnant mice with Carbon dioxide (CO2) overdose, remove uterus with dissection scissors and free individual fetuses from the embryonic sack. Place embryos into 10 ml sterile Dissection medium (see Recipe 1) in a 100 mm Petri dish and keep it on ice.Note: Clean the abdomen with ethanol 70% before cutting the skin with scissors to avoid embryo contamination. Decapitate mouse embryos with dissection scissors, remove skin and skull and place the brain in a sterile 100 mm petri dish containing 10 ml cold Dissection medium.Note: Remove skin and skull with sharp superfine tip dissecting forceps. Under a stereomicroscope discard the olfactory bulb, cerebellum, and midbrain from the mouse brain using the superfine tip forceps. Then remove meninges and blood vessels. Note: Be careful during the meninges removal procedure. Since the hippocampus is surrounded by meninges, you could inadvertently remove and discard it. Dissect out the hippocampus and the cortex from each hemisphere with the superfine tip forceps.Note: Hippocampus can be easily identified as a “banana” shaped tissue. You can also find images and the procedure to dissect hippocampus in Salazar et al., 2017. Collect the specimens in 12 ml cold Dissection medium in a 15 ml Falcon tube placed on ice.Note: Store the isolated specimens on ice during the whole procedure. Move the dissected tissues from the Petri dish to the 15 ml Falcon tube using the superfine forceps immediately after tissue isolation. At the end of the dissection procedure let the tissues settle at the bottom of the Falcon tube by gravity. Wash tissues three times each with 10 ml fresh Dissection medium previously warmed at 37 °C in a water bath.",
    "Notes: Add the dissection medium from the top of the Falcon and let the tissues settle at the bottom of the Falcon tube by gravity Remove as much medium as possible between each wash but keep the tissues covered by the medium during each step. Remove the medium gently using a 10 ml pipette. Avoid vacuum.  Discard the medium and then add 10 ml disruption medium (see Recipe 2) to the tissue specimen in a 15 ml Falcon tube. Warm at 37 °C for 15 min and mix by inverting the Falcon every 2 min.Let tissues settle at the bottom of the Falcon tube by gravity. Then discard the disruption medium and wash tissues with 10 ml Neutralization medium (see Recipe 3).Let tissues settle at the bottom of the Falcon tube by gravity. Then wash tissues three times each with 10 ml fresh Dissection medium previously warmed at 37 °C.Let tissues settle at the bottom of the Falcon tube by gravity. Discard the medium and then add to the tissue 5 ml Neuronal complete medium (see Recipe 4) previously warmed at 37 °C.Mechanically disrupt the tissue with a 10 ml pipette and resuspend the tissue 15-20 times or until almost tissue clumps are dissolved. Spin the cells at 600 x g for 10 min at room temperature in a 15 ml Falcon bench centrifuge. Discard all the medium with a 10 ml pipette and add 1 ml Neuronal complete medium. Resuspend cells 10-20 times with a P1000 pipette. Note: Avoid cell clumps formation! If some tissue debris remains, let it settle at the bottom of the Falcon by gravity. Then collect the medium that contains all dissociated cells and transfer it to a new 15 ml Falcon tube. Discard the old 15 ml tube with the tissue debris.",
    "Add 4 ml Neuronal complete medium.Count neuronal cells. Average yield is about 8 x 106 cell/cortices, 2.5 x 105 cells/hippocampi obtained from E15.5 mice embryos. For cell counting dilute a small amount of cell suspension (20 μl) 1:4 in Neuronal complete medium and count cells in a Bürker Counting chamber.Note: Diluting cells facilitate cell counting. Include the round shaped and bright cells and exclude irregular shaped and dark cells in the counting. Upon counting, remember to apply the dilution factor. Warm Neurostore medium (see Recipe 5) and cell cooler at 37 °C in a water bath.Upon counting, spin cells at 600 x g for 10 min.Discard all the Neuronal complete medium with a 10 ml pipette.Gently resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml of warm Neurostore medium with a P1000 pipette (about ten times). Once all cell clumps are removed, add warm Neurostore medium to reach the desired cellular concentration.Note: Suggested concentration is 5 x 106 cells/ml Neurostore medium. Store 1 ml of Neurostore medium containing neurons in each cryovial.Note: Aliquot cells with a P1000 tip, 5 x 106 cells/cryovial. Move cell cooler to -80 °C immediately. For long-term storage (above one month and up to one year) store cells in a liquid nitrogen tank.Thawing procedureWarm bath, Dissection medium, and neuronal complete culture medium at 37 °C.Put 9 ml warm Dissection medium in a 15 ml Falcon tube.Move cryovials to the 37 °C bath. Usually, complete thawing takes 2-3 min.Add 1 ml Neurostore containing cells to the 15 ml Falcon tube with warm Dissection medium using a P1000 pipette.Pellet cells at 600 x g for 10 min.Discard the medium.Gently resuspend cells in 1 ml warm Neuronal complete culture medium with a P1000 pipette (about ten times).Note: Resuspend until cell clumps disappear. Add 4 ml warm neuronal complete culture medium.",
    "Count the cells (as reported in Procedure A–Neuronal cells preparation and freezing procedure, Step A15).Note: Be fast in cell counting to reduce cellular stress. We suggest evaluating cellular viability by Trypan Blue staining. Seed the desired number of cells on proper culture support in Neuronal complete medium. Notes: We suggest coating culture support with Poly-D-Lysine coating solution (see Recipe 6). Incubate o/n at room temperature or 2 h at 37 °C followed by 3 x ultra-pure water washes. For 12-well plates, we suggest adding a volume of 500 μl/ well of Poly-D-Lysine coating solution. We suggest scaling up or down the volume of the poly-D-Lysine coating according to the diameter of the plate wells. We suggest seeding 750-1,000 cells/mm2. Mix the proper amount of cells and Neuron complete medium to reach the desired number of cell. Add the correct volume of the mix into each well."
