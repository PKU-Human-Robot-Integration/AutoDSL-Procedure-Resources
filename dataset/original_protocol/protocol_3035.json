The following step-by-step method summarizes the method for Tg(NEXT-cmv:tdtomato) construction as example.\nNote: For example, the In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit; https://www.takarabio.com/assets/a/112472[href=https://www.takarabio.com/assets/a/112472].\nAlternatives: Construct a transgenic plasmid by replacing the DNA cassette with the desired promoter/enhancer or cDNA of the gene of interest sequence with the fgk-egfp cassette in Tg(NEXT-fgk:egfp).\nDesign two primer sets in the prepared host plasmid for inverse PCR (cmv:tdtomato forward and reverse primer) and the inserted DNA fragment including the 665-bp tgfbr2l.L fragment (In-fusion tgfbr2l forward and reverse primer) (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nAmplify host plasmid DNA by inverse PCR and the tgfbr2l fragment with KOD One DNA polymerase (Toyobo; Cat#KMM-101).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2782_7.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2782_8.csv\nNote: The extension time depends on the PCR product size; i.e., approximately . <1 kb, 1 sec; 1–10 kb, 5 sec/kb.\nConfirm the PCR product size by electrophoresis. In this case, 768 bp of the inserted genome DNA fragment containing the 665-bp tgfbr2l.L fragment from Tg(NEXT-fgk:egfp) and 5194 bp of the pCS2 host plasmid containing the cmv promoter and tdtomato cDNA fragments were amplified.\nPurify the PCR products using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen; Cat#28104) following the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.qiagen.com/jp/landing-pages/microbiome-rna-research-workflow/sample-disruption/qiaquick-pcr-purification-kit/[href=https://www.qiagen.com/jp/landing-pages/microbiome-rna-research-workflow/sample-disruption/qiaquick-pcr-purification-kit/]).\nElute the PCR product with 30–50 μL of nuclease-free water.\nPause point: The purified PCR product can be stored at −20°C for subsequent experiments.\nMix the following reagents to obtain a 10 μL reaction mixture.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2782_9.csv\nIncubate the reaction mixture for 15 min at 50°C.",
    "Note: Details may change depending upon the desired gene of interest and plasmid size and concentration.\nAfter transformation, confirm the plasmid insert sequence by PCR and Sanger sequencing.\nDesign some primer sets in the host plasmid and the inserted DNA fragment.\nConfirm the PCR product size by electrophoresis.\nDNA sequencing (in-house or outsourced).\nUse a plasmid DNA extraction kit to isolate plasmid DNA (Thermo Scientific; Cat#FERK0502) following the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/fermentas-genejet-plasmid-miniprep-kit/FERK0502[href=https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/fermentas-genejet-plasmid-miniprep-kit/FERK0502]).\nPurify the plasmid DNA using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen; Cat#28104) following the manufacturer’s instructions.\nNote: This step is performed to avoid residues of ethyl alcohol, RNAases, and surfactants that can affect the viability of the injected embryos.\nElute the DNA in 30–50 μL of nuclease-free water.\nPause point: The purified plasmid DNA can be stored at −20°C for subsequent experiments.\nIn vitro synthesis of sgRNA targeting the tgfbr2l locus\nTiming: 5 h\nThis section describes the amplification of template DNA and sgRNA synthesis.\nPrepare the following oligonucleotide set13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13],14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14] : sgRNA PCR primer 1 (5′-AAAAGCACCGACTCGGTGCCACTTTTTCAAGTTGATAACGGACTAGCCTTATTTTAACTTGCTATTTCTAGCTCTAAAAC-3′); sgRNA PCR primer 2 (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGAGCCTTTGGGTCCGATACGTTTTAGAGCTAGAAATAGCAAG-3′). Underlined sequence is the T7 promoter and bold sequence is the tgfbr2l target sequence. Only this sgRNA set is used for targeted integration of the construct into the Xenopus genome during the NEXTrans procedure.\nAmplify the template by PCR according to the PCR-based sgRNA preparation strategy. We recommend using KOD FX Neo DNA polymerase (Toyobo; Cat#KFX-201).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2782_10.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2782_11.csv\nPurify the PCR products using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen; Cat#28104). Elute the PCR product with 30–50 μL of nuclease-free water.\nCheck the specificity of the amplification by agarose electrophoresis; PCR product size should be 117 bp.\nQuantitate the concentration using a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop).\nPause point: The purified PCR product can be stored at −20°C for subsequent experiments.",
    "Synthesize and purify the sgRNA using an in vitro transcription kit based on T7 RNA polymerase (e.g., Nippon Gene; Cat#314-08691) following the manufacturer’s instructions.\nMix the following reagents to obtain a 20 μL reaction mixture.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2782_12.csv\nIncubate the reaction mixture at 37°C for 2.5 h.\nAdd 2 μL of DNase I.\nNote: Make sure to add the DNase after transcription to remove the template DNA.\nIncubate at 37°C for 15 min.\nAdd 578 μL of sgRNA binding buffer.\nTransfer 600 μL of the solution to a spin column (supplied) for purification.\nCentrifuge at 13,000 × g for 1 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and add 750 μL of gRNA wash buffer.\nCentrifuge at 13,000 × g for 1 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and centrifuge at 13,000 × g for 1 min at 4°C.\nElute sgRNA with 30–50 μL of nuclease-free water.\nQuantify the concentration. Normally, 50–100 μg of sgRNA is synthesized. Divide the sgRNA into aliquots in the nuclease-free tubes. troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nPause point: The sgRNA can be stored in aliquots at −80°C until it is ready to be used for injection mixture preparation (step 22).\nPreparation of in vitro fertilization eggs\nTiming: 3 days\nThis section describes how to obtain fertilized eggs and preparation of injection mixture.\nInject 30 U (150 μL) of Serotropin into females 2–3 days before use.\nCritical: The egg quality is the most important factor for successfully generating transgenic animals.\nThe day before fertilization, inject 450 U (450 μL) and 100 U (100 μL) of HCG into females and males, respectively. Keep all animals at 18°C thereafter. In our case, we injected the hormone 20 h prior to the desired time for egg laying.\nSperm preparation.",
    "On the morning of the injection, deeply anesthetize two males by submersion in a bath of 0.2% MS222 for 15–30 min.\nAfter euthanasia, isolate the testes and keep them in a 1.5-mL tube on ice.\nJust before egg collection, grind gently one side of the testes from the two males with a pestle and approximately 1 mL of 1× MMR.\nCollect 300–500 eggs by gently squeezing from two to three females and keep them in separate sterile Petri dishes.\nAdd sperm solution to each plate and mix gently with pipette tips. Leave for 5 min at 18°C.\nCritical: Start the count-up timer immediately to record the precise time after in vitro fertilization, because the injection step must be finished in the period 1–1.5 h after in vitro fertilization to reduce mosaicism.\nSoak the dish with 0.1× MMR for 15 min at 18°C.\nDe-jelly the embryos with de-jelling solution containing L-cysteine within 3 min.\nRinse the embryos with 0.1× MMR several times.\nTransfer the embryos into pre-cooled 0.1× MMR (11°C).\nKeep the embryos at a low temperature (11°C) to delay the first cleavage.\nNote: To reduce mosaicism, inject Cas9 Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) before the first cleavage.\nCritical: The first cleavage should occur after 2–2.5 h of incubation at 11°C. The embryos must be kept at 11°C in an incubator to control their development.\nDilute stock Cas9 protein to 1 μg/μL with 1× Cas9 buffer just before use.",
    "Preparation of injection mixture. After transferring the embryos into an incubator, add 0.46 μL of 10× Cas9 buffer, 1 μL of Cas9 protein in 1× Cas9 buffer (1 μg/μL), 200 ng of sgRNA targeting tgfbr2l, and 50 ng of NEXTrans plasmid targeting tgfbr2l, and adjust the volume to 4.6 μL with nuclease-free water. The final concentration per egg is 1 ng of Cas9, 200 pg of sgRNA, 50 pg of NEXTrans plasmid. The Cas9 RNP and NEXTrans plasmid mixture must be kept at 25°C for at least 15 min. Prepare just before use.\nInjection of Cas9 RNP and NEXTrans plasmid into fertilized eggs\nTiming: 30 min for 400–500 embryos\nThis section describes the injection setup, dose, and rearing method after injection.\nMake 3–6 lines of V-shaped grooves on an agarose-coated injection plate using a blade and align the fertilized eggs (embryos) on it. The eggs can be placed in any way during injection (e.g., agarose-coated dish or nylon grid).\nPrepare the microneedles using a needle puller (Narishige; model PN-31) with the following settings: magnet main 60, magnet sub 20, and heater 86.8. Break off the tip of the glass needle with fine tweezers. Then, set up a microinjector and fill the microneedles with 1–2 μL of injection mixture containing Cas9 RNP and NEXTrans plasmid.\nCritical: The needles must be fine to efficiently perform injections for genome editing.\nAfter 1 h of total incubation from in vitro fertilization, inject 4.6 nL of the pre-mixed Cas9 RNP and NEXTrans plasmid into the embryos. Complete the injections within 30–40 min.\nCritical: We recommend that this injection step be completed 1–1.5 h after in vitro fertilization. We found that injection in this period was the most efficient way of obtaining transgenic animals.",
    "Incubate embryos at 18°C for 3–5 h in a Petri dish with injection medium.\nSelect injected embryos by transferring the embryos to 0.1× MMR at the morula or blastula stage because injection medium disturbs gastrulation, then store at 18°C. Using a fresh plate and rinsing multiple times are also recommended. Select normally developing embryos. troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nCritical: Avoid a high density of embryos on the Petri dish (100 mm) for embryo health (up to 100 embryos in the same dish). The next day, transfer the embryos at 20°C and keep them until they reach stage 45; normally 3–4 days is needed.\nCritical: To improve the development rate, the 0.1× MMR must be changed every day and dead and abnormally developing embryos should be removed.\nSelect the injected embryos with reporter gene expression. In the case of Xla.Tg(NEXT-fgk:egfp), strong GFP signals were observed in the tail and gill at stage 45 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). The developmental stage can be judged by Nieuwkoop (1967).15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15] troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2782-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "Germline transmission\nTiming: within approximately 1 year\nThis section describes the housing condition of transgenic X. laevis embryos.\nRear the transgenic animals until sexual maturation.\nNote: We recommend keeping the embryos that exhibit strong transgene expression in the gill and tail region, not those with half-transgenesis or spotted ectopic expression, for the case of Tg(NEXT-fgk:egfp). In our case, we kept the transgenic animals in dechlorinated water at approximately 26°C for 8–9 months to accelerate animal growth.\nCritical: Rear the embryos and froglets before sexual maturation at approximately 26°C. According to the housing method, it is recommended that X. laevis adults are reared at 18°C to maintain egg and sperm quality. However, low-temperature rearing delays the growth and sexual maturation of the embryos and young froglets.\nAfter 8–9 months, transfer all transgenic frogs to dechlorinated water at 18 °C at least 1 month before use.\nObtain the F1 siblings by crossing sexually mature transgenic males and wild-type females using in vitro fertilization or natural mating.16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]\nCritical: We recommend using sexually mature transgenic males to generate F1 siblings because males reach sexual maturity faster than females.\nCheck the transgene expression in the F1 siblings. In the case of Tg(NEXT-fgk:egfp), eGFP-positive signals can be clearly seen in the gill and tail fin until stage 45. troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nGenotyping by PCR\nTiming: 6 h\nThis section describes a method for detecting the transgene by genomic PCR in F1 embryos.\nRear reporter expressing F1 embryos to the stage at which the phenotype is to be evaluated and collect samples individually.\nDeeply anesthetize the embryos with 0.01% MS222 in 0.1x MMR, then euthanatize them for genomic DNA (gDNA) extraction.\nExtract gDNA from each sample using a silica column-based DNA purification kit (Qiagen; Cat#69504) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. https://www.qiagen.com/nl/resources/download.aspx?id=68f29296-5a9f-40fa-8b3d-1c148d0b3030&lang=en[href=https://www.qiagen.com/nl/resources/download.aspx?id=68f29296-5a9f-40fa-8b3d-1c148d0b3030&lang=en]",
    "Elute gDNA with 30–50 μL of elution buffer, then use 1 μL for the following PCR genotyping template. Normally, 5–10 μg of gDNA is extracted from each embryo at stage 45.\nPause point: The gDNA can be stored at −20°C for subsequent experiments.\nFor the case of Tg(NEXT-fgk:egfp), the NEXTrans plasmid can be integrated into the tgfbr2l.L and/or tgfbr2l.S locus in both directions, giving a total of four possible patterns due to NHEJ-mediated integration. Prepare PCR primers (primers 1–4) designed for each locus (host genome) region and a common primer (primer 5) designed for the eGFP (transgene) region in the NEXTrans plasmid to detect the integration site (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nAnalyze the genotype by performing PCR genotyping of the gDNA. To detect the plasmid integration into the tgfbr2l locus, mix each of primers 1–4 with common primer 5. For PCR genotyping, we recommend using KOD One DNA polymerase (Toyobo; Cat#KMM-101) and the following conditions. troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2782_13.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2782_14.csv\nVisualize the size of the PCR products using an electrophoresis system with high resolution, such as TapeStation (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).
