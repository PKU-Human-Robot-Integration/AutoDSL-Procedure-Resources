    "1. Co-immunoprecipitation\nSeed HEK293 cells at 2 x 105 cells per well in one 6-well plate in 2 ml Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplement with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 U/mL Penicillin-Streptomycin (Pen-Strep).\nGrow cells for 48 hr at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\nWash cells with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times. Harvest cells by centrifugation at 500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nPrepare nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions using commercial nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents. Follow manufacturer's instruction with some modifications.\n\t\nUse 3 x 106 cells for one co-immunoprecipitation experiment (approximately with 90% confluency from 3 wells of one 6-well plate). Add 300 µl cold cytoplasmic extraction solution (CER I) and vortex for 15 sec at the highest speed.\nIncubate for 30 min on ice. During incubation, vortex for 5 s every 10 min.\nAdd 16.5 µl cold cytoplasmic extraction solution II (CER II), vortex for 5 sec and incubate for 5 min on ice.\nVortex for 5 sec and centrifuge at 16,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nTransfer supernatant (cytoplasmic extract) into a new pre-chilled tube, and keep on ice until used.\nWash insoluble pellets (containing nuclei) three times with 1 ml cold PBS each time by pipetting up and down five times. Remove PBS after wash.\nAdd 150 µl cold nuclear extraction solution (NER), vortex for 15 sec and incubate 1 hr on ice. During incubation, vortex for 15 sec and pipette 10 times with a 200 µl tip every 10 min.\nVortex for 15 s and centrifuge at 16,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\nTransfer supernatant (nuclear extract) into a new pre-chilled tube, keep on ice until use.\nTake out 10% of the volume of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts each as inputs.",
    "Add cold PBS to the remaining extracts to a final volume of 1 ml. Keep on ice until use.\n\tNOTE: Pre-clearing is not essential when using Protein G-conjugated magnetic beads. However, if the background is high, perform pre-clearing by incubating 40 µl Protein G-conjugated magnetic beads (50% slurry) and 1 ml diluted lysate from this step at 4 °C for 30 min on a rotator. Separate supernatant (pre-cleared lysate) from beads with magnetic rack. Discard the beads.\nTo couple primary antibody with Protein G-conjugated magnetic beads, incubate 40 µl Protein G-conjugated magnetic beads (50% slurry) with 4 µg rabbit polyclonal anti-RBM3 antibody or rabbit IgG (negative control) in 200 µl PBS plus Tween 20 buffer (PBST, 0.02% Tween 20) at room temperature (RT) for 40 min on a rotator.\nSeparate antibody-coupled beads and supernatant with a magnetic rack, and discard the supernatant. Wash the beads once with 200 µl PBST (0.02%).\nAdd 1 ml diluted lysates (or if necessary, pre-cleared lysates) to the beads, and incubate on a rotator at 4 °C overnight.\nOn the next day, separate the beads and supernatant by a magnetic rack, and discard the supernatant. Wash 3 x 10 min with 0.5 ml PBST (0.02%) for each tube at 4 °C on a rotator with a fixed speed of 20 rpm.\nElute proteins from the beads by adding 40 µl sample buffer (1x commercial sample buffer and 50 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT)). Heat at 70 °C for 10 min. Spin down and transfer liquids to a new 1.5 ml tube.",
    "Dilute input lysates in sample buffer (final concentration: 1x commercial sample buffer and 50 mM DTT) and heat at 70 °C for 10 min. Load inputs and immunoprecipitated proteins from the last step to a precast 4-12% bis-Tris gel. The loading volume of each well should not exceed 20 µl. Perform electrophoresis in 1x commercial running buffer on ice for 35 min.\n\tNOTE: Load nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts in a ratio of 1:2 (V/V), which reflects the same initial amount of cells.\nTransfer proteins to PVDF membrane in 1x commercial transfer buffer at 30 V for 2 hr at 4 °C.\nBlock membrane with 5% skimmed milk in PBST (0.1% Tween 20) at RT for 40 min on a shaker.\nIncubate membrane with primary antibodies (both diluted in 1:1,000) in PBST (0.1%) at 4 °C overnight.\nWash 3 x 10 min with PBST (0.1%) at RT on a shaker.\nIncubate membrane with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (both diluted in 1:5,000) in PBST (0.1%) at RT for 1 hr.\nWash 3 x 10 min with PBST (0.1%) at RT on a shaker.\nUse 0.2 ml enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) substrate mixture per cm2 membrane, incubate at RT for 5 min. Avoid all light from this step onwards except red lights.\nDiscard liquid and expose to an X-ray film in a film cassette. Develop film using an automatic film processing machine.\n2. Immunocytochemistry and Proximity Ligation Assay\nSeed HEK293 cells at 1.5 x 104 cells per chamber in one 8-chamber poly-D-lysine coated slide in 0.4 ml DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 U/ml Pen-Strep.\nGrow cells for 48 hr at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\nAspirate medium, and fix cells with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min at RT.",
    "Aspirate PFA, and wash 3 x 10 min with 0.5 ml PBS per chamber.\nPermeabilize and block cells with 0.5% Triton X-100 and 5% normal goat serum (NGS) in PBS at RT for 1 hr.\nIncubate with primary antibodies in 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% NGS in PBS on a shaker at 4 °C overnight. Dilute mouse monoclonal anti-NF90 antibody and rabbit polyclonal anti-RBM3 antibody 1:100 in PBS for double-staining. For negative control, omit independently either of the two primary antibodies, and omit both antibodies in a third control.\n\tNOTE: Do not use commercial blocking and diluting reagents.\nWash 3 x 10 min with 0.5 ml PBS per chamber.\nSubject to immunocytochemistry or proximity ligation assay protocols\nImmunocytochemistry\n\t\t\nIncubate with 1:500 diluted green fluorescent dye-coupled anti-mouse and red fluorescent dye-coupled anti-rabbit secondary antibodies at RT for 1 hr.

Mount with 250 µ, mounting medium per slide.\nProximity ligation assay\n\t\t\nPrepare proximity ligation assay probes. Mix and dilute two proximity ligation assay probes (anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies attached with different oligonucleotides which can ligate through the addition of two other oligonucleotides in ligation solution) both 1:5 in 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% NGS in PBS, with a total volume of 320 µl for one 8-chamber slide (approximately 40 µl per cm2). Incubate at RT for 20 min.\nRemove the chambers from the glass slide and add the diluted probes. Incubate in a humidity incubator at 37 °C for 1 hr.\nPrepare ligation solution.
