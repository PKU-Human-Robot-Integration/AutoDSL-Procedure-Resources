  "procedures": [
    "Notes: The presented procedure is for analysis of Escherichia coli RNAP and the transcription initiation factor σ70. The procedure can be adapted to analysis of any other RNAP by replacing E. coli RNAP with the RNAP of interest, replacing the transcription factor σ70 by the transcription initiation factor(s) used by the RNAP of interest, replacing the promoter by a promoter used by the RNAP of interest, and replacing the transcription buffer with a transcription buffer suitable for the RNAP of interest. DNA templates are designed to facilitate generation and analysis of defined initial RNA products formed using NAD+, NADH, dpCoA, or ATP as the initiating substrate (Figure 2A). Initiation using NAD+, NADH, dpCoA, or ATP requires A:T (i.e., template-strand T) at the transcription start site (position +1; Bird et al., 2016). Use of CTP as the extending nucleotide requires C:G (i.e., template-strand G) at the first position downstream of the transcription start site (position +2). Generation of defined initial RNA products representing one, and only one, nucleotide-addition reaction requires a T:A or C:G (i.e., template-strand A or G, which are not complementary to NTPs present in reactions).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170616/20170616013953_8543.jpgFigure 2.

(Two columns are needed because the DNA quantity exceeds the binding capacity of a single column.)Analyze aliquots by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm production of 100 bp double-stranded DNA fragment (‘dsDNA transcription template’).Quantify dsDNA transcription template by UV-Vis spectrophotometry, and adjust concentration to 0.5-1 μM in water.Transcription reactionsTemplate + RNAP miximgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170616/20170616014444_2663.jpgNCIN + NTP mixesimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170616/20170616014549_4987.jpgNote: The water, 5x transcription buffer, [α32P]-CTP, CTP, and NCIN are pre-mixed to yield a ‘master mix’, of which 4 μl is added to 1 μl of the appropriate ATP dilution. Incubate Template + RNAP mix at 37 °C for 15 min to enable formation of a catalytically competent RNAP-promoter open complex.Add 5 μl Template + RNAP mix to pre-warmed NCIN + NTP mixes, and incubate 10 min at 37 °C.Add 10 μl ice-cold stop buffer. (Keep samples on ice if gel is to be loaded immediately, or at -20 °C if gel is to be loaded later.) Note: Do not boil samples that contain NCIN-capped RNA before loading gels. (NCINs can be heat-labile.)Analyze products by electrophoresis on 7.5 M urea 20% polyacrylamide nucleotide sequencing gel (National Diagnostics, Inc.",
    "; prepared per instructions of the vendor, but using one-half of specified ammonium persulfate and Temed concentrations)Pour gel.Pre-run gel at 50 W for 20-60 min before loading samples (top reservoir buffer, TBE; bottom reservoir buffer, TBE containing 0.3 M sodium acetate).Load samples (5 μl per lane).Optional: In a lane adjacent to sample lanes, load 1 μl transcription stop buffer with added 0.025% amaranth red as a marker. Amaranth red migrates similarly to free NTPs and allows a visual estimation of migration of dinucleotide products.Run gel at 50 W (buffers as above) for 120 min or until desired separation is achieved.Note: The addition of 0.3 M sodium acetate to the bottom reservoir buffer creates a salt gradient that compresses and improves resolution for short RNA products (Vo et al., 2003).Disassemble gel apparatus. Wrap gel on glass plate with polyethylene wrap, and expose to storage-phosphor screen for 3-18 h at 4 °C."
