  "procedures": [
    "All of the procedures were carried out in conformity with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health (NIH; Publication No. 85-23, revised 1985) and approved by the regional ethics committee of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences.\nCAUTION: This protocol includes the application of Class 3B laser instruments and will require proper training and adherence to safety guidelines. Class 3B lasers can seriously damage the eyes and can heat the skin. Class 3B lasers are not considered a burn hazard. Eye protection goggles must be worn at all times when operating the laser device.\n1. Laser light transmission experiments\nNOTE: Used here were three 18-month-old male BALB/c mice obtained from the animal facility of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. A 60 mW laser (660 nm) with a circular beam shape of 2.5 mm in diameter is used as the light source. The laser source produces a circularly polarized light with a Gaussian intensity profile and is operated in continuous wave mode. A commercial photodiode power meter with a 10 nW resolution, a square 1 cm2 photodiode active area, and a spectral response range from 400 to 1100 nm is used to measure the transmitted light power through the samples.\nSample preparation\nIn order to obtain fresh samples, deeply anesthetize the mouse with a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg).\nDissect the mouse's head with regular scissors, starting from the point located just above the shoulders.\nRotate the head so that the ventral side of the jaw faces up. Slide angled dissection scissors smoothly through the oral cavity until the resistance of the mandibular junction is noticed. Cut all large muscles linking the mandible bone to the skull and discard them.\nRemove the palatine bones, using angled dissection scissors.",
    "Discard all flesh surrounding the skull, using curved forceps.\nDissect the lower portion of the skull, and then, carefully take the brain out of the remaining skull bone, with a curved spatula.\nFix the intact brain tissue in a 2% agarose gel so the tissue will be suitable for slicing.\n\t\tNOTE: In order to obtain an intact skull plus scalp sample, the brain tissue should be removed from the ventral side of the animal's head without any damage to the dorsal portion of the head.\nBrain slicing procedure\nSpread a drop of superglue (~0.05 mL) on the surface of the vibratome mounting block.\nCarefully attach the agarose block to the vibratome mounting block so that the ventral surface of the brain is facedown, and adjust its position.\nSlightly match the vibratome blade to the upper surface of the agarose block and record the cutter value as the primary level.\nFill the vibratome tank with ice-cold normal saline solution.\nAdjust the vibratome parameters (e.g., the slice thickness [1 mm], speed [5 of 5 on device unit], and vibration frequency [5 of 5 on device unit]) to obtain satisfactory slicing.\nCut the brain transversely into a slice with a 1,000 µm thickness.\n\t\tNOTE: The slice is the portion of the brain tissue delimited by the cortical surface and a plane positioned 1,000 µm inferior to the cortical surface (the dorsal hippocampus).\nAdd a drop of water (~0.05 mL) on the optical glass surface and put the brain slice on top of it. Then, add a drop of water on the brain slice and carefully place the second optical glass on top of it.\n\t\tNOTE: A drop of water should be added to the sample glass boundaries in order to prevent tissue drying and light scattering from rough surfaces.",
    "Measurement of light transmission through the head tissues\nSet up the optical equipment, including the laser device, reflecting mirrors, and power meter unit.\n\t\tCAUTION: Put on protective eye goggles prior to turning on the laser.\nIn the absence of a sample on the power meter, turn on the laser device and focus the laser beam on the mirror that is located at the proper distance for guiding the beam perpendicular to the photodiode's active area.\n\t\tNOTE: Light transmission measurements must be performed in a darkroom at room temperature (23-25 °C), within 30 min after the head tissues have been extracted.\nPerform measurements on the sliced brain tissue.\n\t\t\nPlace two blank optical glasses on the surface of the power meter.\nRead the transmitted light power (I0) from the power meter's display screen and record the value.\nGently place the brain sample, which is encompassed by two optical glasses, on the surface of the power meter, focus the beam on the tissue's respective area, read the transmitted power, and record the value.\nPerform measurements on the skull plus the scalp.\n\t\t\nPlace a blank optical glass on the surface of the power meter.\nRead the transmitted light power (I0) from the power meter's display screen and record the value.\nLightly place an optical glass with fresh skull plus scalp tissue on the surface of the power meter, match the light beam on the bregma zone, read the transmitted power, and record the value.\nIn order to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio, repeat the light transmission measurement at least 3x for all samples.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The bregma zone is placed in an approximately 3 mm rostral to a line drawn through the anterior base of the ears. The thickness of the skull plus scalp tissue is measured by a standard caliper.\n2. Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT)",
    "NOTE: Forty-five male BALB/c mice assigned to three groups of 15 mice each were used. The groups were composed of young-control mice (2 months old) that received sham-PBMT, aged-control mice (18 months old) that received sham-PBMT, and aged-PBMT mice (18 months old) that received PBMT. The sham-PBMT treatment consisted of treatment identical to the PBMT group but with the laser inactive. Mice were obtained from the animal facility of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences and were housed in the animal holding unit of the Neurosciences Research Center (NSRC) at 24-25 °C and 55% relative humidity, with a 12 h light and 12 h dark photoperiod. Food and water were provided ad libitum. All mice were acclimatized for at least 1 week prior to treatment.\nLaser treatment procedure\n\tNOTE: A diode GaAlAs laser with continuous wave mode at 660 nm wavelength was used for transcranial PBMT treatment. The laser device was operated at an output power of 200 ± 2 mW and an irradiance of 6.66 W/cm2, with a spot size of 0.03 cm2. An average fluence of 99.9 J/cm2 per each session was delivered to the scalp surface for 15 s of irradiation. The irradiation was administered 1x daily for 2 consecutive weeks.\n\t\nBring the mice in their home cages to the therapy room, approximately 20 min prior to beginning the treatment.\nConnect an electric protector to the wall outlet.\nInsert the laser device plug into an electric protector.\nCover the tip of the laser probe with a transparent nylon film in order to prevent any scratching to the surface.\nCarefully connect the probe to the channel of the laser device.\nTurn on the laser device and wait a few seconds for it to warm up.\nAdjust the laser/treatment parameters, including the irradiation time and operation mode.",
    "In the absence of any samples, determine the laser average power by contacting the tip of the probe to the active area of the power meter on the laser device. Record the value.\nRepeat the calibration process (step 2.1.8) at least 5x, read the incident powers from the power meter's display screen, and record the values.\nGently hold a mouse by the dorsal skin of the animal's neck in the palm of a hand and immobilize its head.\n\t\tNOTE: In the current protocol, the laser probe is placed on the bregma zone, which is ~3 mm rostral to a line drawn between the internal base of the ears.\nLightly place the tip of the probe directly on the scalp at the midline, approximately 3 mm rostral to a line drawn through the anterior base of the ears.\n\t\tNOTE: Hold the probe at an approximately 45° angle to the plane of the abdomen.\nIn order to avoid direct irradiation to the animal's eyes, first contact the tip of the probe on the head and, then, turn on the laser device.\nTurn on the laser and stably hold the probe until the completion of the irradiation.\nAfter the end of the therapy, withdraw the laser probe from the head and gently return the mouse to its cage.\nTurn off the laser device and disconnect the probe from the device.\nClean the laser probe with an appropriate optical cleaner.\nTransfer the mice to the animal facility.\n3. Behavioral Tasks\nOpen-field test\nAssess the locomotor activity of each mouse by the total distance traveled during an open-field test, as described previously15.\nBarnes maze task\n​Apparatus",
    "NOTE: The spatial learning and memory task is performed in a Barnes maze16. The apparatus used for this neurobehavioral task consists of a circular platform made of black wood (95 cm in diameter) with 20 equidistant, 5 cm-diameter circular holes that are located on the platform, 3 cm from the perimeter. The apparatus is elevated 50 cm from the floor to prevent the animal from climbing down. A movable black plastic escape box (20 cm x 15 cm x 5 cm) is placed under the escape hole. A black maze is used for testing white mice, and a black mat should be placed under the maze when a software tracking system is used.\n\t\t\nPlace the maze apparatus in the center of a quiet room with bright overhead lighting.\nPlace a \"Do Not Enter\" sign on the outside of the task room door.\nAttach visual-spatial cues to the perimeter walls.\nPosition a digital video camera above the maze platform.\nClean the surface of the maze platform with 70% ethanol to remove unwanted olfactory cues.\nAdd a small amount of bedding from the animal's home cage to the inside of the escape box to serve as an olfactory cue.\nAdaptation session\nBring each mouse to the task room approximately 30 min prior to beginning the experiment, in order for the mouse to become habituated.\nRemove the mouse from its cage and gently place the animal in the escape box for 1 min.\nTraining session\n\t\tNOTE: The training session is repeated for each mouse on 4 consecutive days.\n\t\t\nGently remove the mouse from the escape box.\nPlace the mouse in the center of the arena; then, place the start chamber on top of the mouse.\nRemove the start chamber after 10 s, and allow the mouse to explore the arena for 3 min.",
    "Quietly move to the computer area and put on noise-canceling headphones.\nTrigger a negative auditory stimulus consisting of a loud white noise of approximately 80 dB at the platform level and begin videotaping the mouse.\nTurn off the white noise and stop videotaping when the mouse enters the escape box. Allow the animal to remain undisturbed in the box for 1 min.\nRemove the mouse from the escape box and place it back into its cage.\nRepeat steps 3.4.2 through 3.4.7 4x per day, with 3 min intervals between repeated trials.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Between all trials, remove any urine or feces from the arena surface and clean the maze with 70% ethanol.\nProbe trial session\nFollowing the last training trial, 24 h later, remove the escape box from the maze platform and repeat steps 3.4.2 through 3.4.5.\nAfter 3 min, turn off the white noise and stop videotaping. Remove the mouse from the maze arena and place it back into its cage.\nAfter all the animals have been tested, clean the maze platform and the start chamber. Turn off the room lights and remove the \"Do Not Enter\" sign from the door.\nStore the video recordings from the testing sessions to an external hard drive for further analysis.\nSet up the video-tracking software program and extract the parameters of interest from the recorded videos, including the latency time to find the target hole during 4 days of training sessions and the time spent in the target quadrant during the probe trial session.\n4. Biochemical assessment\nATP levels in the hippocampus\nDeeply anesthetize each mouse with an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine (100 mg per gram of body weight) and xylazine (10 mg per gram of body weight).\nDecapitate the animal and rapidly remove the brain tissue from the skull.",
    "Dissect out the hippocampus and homogenize the tissue in ice-cold sample buffer (provided by the kit) with a tissue homogenizer.\nImmediately centrifuge the homogenate at 2,000 x g for 3 min at 4 °C.\nTransfer the supernatant to a clean tube.\nAssess the hippocampal ATP levels, using the spectrophotometric method as described previously11.\nSubscription Required.
