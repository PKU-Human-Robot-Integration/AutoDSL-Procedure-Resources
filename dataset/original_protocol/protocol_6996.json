    "The re-contextualization of PTSD-like memory promotes its normalization.A decontextualized memory of the trauma, associated with the systematic avoidance of conscious recollection of the trauma, would contribute to the intrusive re-experiencing of the trauma in safe situations (i.e., flashbacks) characterizing PTSD (van Der        Kolk et al., 2001;        Bremner et al., 2003; Brewin and Holmes, 2003). Accordingly, treatment of PTSD would imply a switch from a decontextualized intrusive traumatic memory to a normal, contextualized fear memory. We thus reasoned that re-exposure to the most emotionally laden traumatic cue (i.e., the tone in our study) in the traumatic context could not only reactivate the traumatic memory but also promote the re-contextualization of the trauma and thereby cure PTSD-like memory.Cf. Part II, Procedure A, 1-3, and Post-conditioning injections of corticosterone or NaCl (Day 1)Cf. Part II, Procedure A, Memory tests (Day 2), 1-3.Two days after fear conditioning and one day after the classical memory tests (Day 3), re-expose the (Veh- and CORT-injected) animals to the tone cue in the conditioning context and record three successive sessions of the behavioral responses: one before (first 2 min), one during (next 2 min), and one after (2 last min) tone presentation. Therefore, the first 2 min (pre-tone) allows us to assess the level of conditioned fear to the conditioning context alone, while the conditioned response to the tone is assessed during the next 2 min, both by the percentage of freezing during the tone presentation and by the tone ratio described above.",
    "Three control conditions are designed:Veh- and CORT-injected mice are re-exposed to the tone alone (in the familiar context)Veh- and CORT-injected mice are re-exposed to the conditioning context aloneVeh- and CORT-injected mice are re-exposed both to the tone and to the context but spaced out of 2 hOn day 4 assess the quality of the fear memory resulting from these different re-exposure conditions to trauma-related stimuli by using the classical memory tests used on day 2.Animals from each re-exposure condition are first re-exposed to the tone cue in the familiar context.Animals from each re-exposure condition are then re-exposed to the conditioning context 2 h later.While an abnormal fear response to the tone together with a low conditioned fear to the context would confirm PTSD-like memory, an absence of conditioned fear to the tone together with a high conditioned fear to the context would attest for a normalization of traumatic memory (Figure 3, adapted from Al          Abed et al., 2020).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4174/bioprotoc-11-19-4174-g003.jpgFigure 3. Switching from PTSD-like memory to normal fear memory by trauma re-contextualization. Top panel, scheme illustration of the behavioral procedure: fear conditioning (Day 1), memory tests (Day 2), trauma re-contextualization by complete re-exposure to trauma-related cues (i.e., to the tone in the conditioning context vs. partial re-exposure to the tone alone, context alone, or tone and context spaced out of 2 h; Day 3), memory tests (Day 4). A. Curative effect of trauma re-contextualization with a switch from PTSD-like memory on Day 3 to normal contextual memory on Day 4: complete re-exposure to trauma-related cues in CORT-injected mice abolishes the abnormal fear response to the tone and normalizes the conditioned fear to the context (Veh vs. CORT: ns). B. Partial re-exposure to trauma-related cues (i.e.",
    ", tone and context spaced out of 2 h) on Day 3 does not modify the PTSD-like memory profile in CORT-injected mice, which still display an abnormal fear response to the tone together with a low conditioned fear of the context on Day 4 (minimum significance in the tone test: repeated measures × Veh/CORT: F2,36 = 4.755; P = 0.0147; in the context test: Veh/CORT: F1,18 = 4.570; P = 0.0465). Similar results are obtained after partial re-exposure to the tone alone or to the context alone (data not shown, cf. Al             Abed et al., 2020). CORT-injected mice discriminate the two contexts used, as attested by their higher freezing levels in the conditioning context than in the familiar chamber (first 2 min, 2a vs. 2b; F1,17 = 7.166; P = 0.0159).

Adapted from Al             Abed et al., 2020           .The optogenetic inhibition of dCA1 neurons during the re-contextualization of traumatic memory suppresses its normalization.Cf. Part I: Virus transfection and fiber implantation.Replicate Part III, Procedure A, 1-3 in CORT-injected mice only.When placing the CORT-injected animals in the conditioning chamber for the re-contextualization procedure, connect each animal to the fiber-optic patch cords for optogenetic manipulations (~6 mW per implanted fiber bilaterally conducted from the laser).In mice expressing ArchT channel and GFP in the dorsal hippocampus and chronically implanted with optic fibers in the dCA1, transitory inhibit the dCA1 neuronal activity by activating the laser (continuous light deliver, 526 nm) during the 6 min re-contextualization procedure.",
    "In control mice expressing ArchT channel and GFP in the dorsal hippocampus and chronically implanted with optic fibers in the dCA1, maintain the laser OFF during the re-contextualization procedure (Figure 4, adapted from Al            Abed et al., 2020).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4174/bioprotoc-11-19-4174-g004.jpgFigure 4. Trauma re-contextualization is hippocampus-dependent and is persistent in the long-term. Top panel, scheme illustration of the behavioral procedure: fear conditioning (Day 1), memory tests (Day 2), trauma re-contextualization (ReC) by complete re-exposure to trauma-related cues (i.e., to the tone in the conditioning context; short-term: Day 4, long-term: Day 30) in control CORT-injected and CORT-injected mice exposed to dCA1 inhibition during re-exposure, memory tests (Day 4). A. dCA1 inhibition during complete re-exposure to trauma-related cues on Day 3 blocks the curative effects of such re-exposure: compared to their control (PTSD-like) re-exposed with Laser OFF (ReC; n = 6), PTSD-like re-exposed animals with Laser ON (n = 7) still display an abnormal fear response to the tone (repeated measures x laser condition: F2,24 = 6.452; P = 0.0057) together with a low conditioned fear to the context (laser condition: F1,12 = 6.922; P = 0.0219) on Day 4 and Day 30 (right panel). B. The remained PTSD-like memory subsequent to partial re-exposure to trauma-related cues (tone and context spaced out of 2 h) persists in the long-term (minimum significance in the tone test: repeated measures x Veh/CORT: F2,34 = 7.935; P = 0.0015; in the context test: Veh/CORT: F1,17 = 4.607; P = 0.0466, repeated measures x Veh/CORT: F2,34 = 4.266; P = 0.0022). Similar results are obtained after partial re-exposure to the tone alone or to the context alone (data not shown here, cf. Al             Abed et al., 2020). Statistical significance was assessed by repeated measures (three 2 min-blocks) 2-sided ANOVA with post-hoc test when appropriate. *P < 0.",

The curative effect of trauma re-contextualization on PTSD-like memory by complete re-exposure to trauma-related cues (i.e., tone in the conditioning context on day 3) was shown to be long lasting (Figure 4A, right panel). Similarly, animals that still displayed PTSD-like fear memory on day 4 after having been subjected to the inefficient partial re-exposure (i.e., to the tone only, context only, or tone and context spaced out of 2 h), or to the optogenetic inhibition of dCA1 cells during the re-contextualization session, still display a PTSD-like memory on day 30 (Figures 4A and 4B, right panels)."
