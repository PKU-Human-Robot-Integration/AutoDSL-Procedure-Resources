Schematics of insertion of mNG in KRAS, NRAS, and Grb2. mNG sequence was inserted at amino terminus of KRAS and NRAS genes (A) and at carboxy terminus of Grb2 gene (B). Donor DNAs were generated for all three genes with homology arms ranging from 500 to 1,000 bp. ATG, Start codon; STOP, Stop codon; HA, Homology Arm; mNG, mNeongreen; gRNA-guide RNA; empty boxes represent exons of KRAS, NRAS and Grb2.Table 1.

Several guide RNA design tools are available online. We routinely use Benchling, Broad Institute GPP (now CRISPick), and CHOPCHOP, among others, to design target gRNAs. Using these tools, two targets for both KRAS and NRAS were identified, which were very close to the Start codons of both the genes. Order two complementary primers for each target (Table 2).Table 2.

Cloning of gRNAs for tagging Grb2 Identification of the target gRNAGrb2 was tagged with mNG at its carboxy terminal. Cloning of Grb2 gRNAs was performed using NEBuilder HiFi DNA assembly mix which allows assembly of a linear plasmid and a single stranded DNA fragment, just as multiple DNA fragments assembly.",

Purified PCR fragments can be used directly as donor DNAs, thus reducing the time of cloning. Cloning of donor DNA for tagging Grb2 To clone donor DNA for Grb2 gene editing, 5’ and 3’ homology arms (HA) were amplified from HeLa genomic DNA using primers designed by the NEbuilder algorithm (NEB), whereas KRAS donor DNA was used as a template to amplify mNG ORF.

Centrifuge the cells and wash once with PBS. Resuspend the final pellet in Cell sorting buffer.Pass the cell suspension through disposable filters to get rid of cell aggregates just before the sorting. Use positive (parental HeLa cells transiently or stably expressing mNG) and negative (parental untagged HeLa cells) controls to calibrate the sorting instrument.Collect single sorted cells in 96-well plate or in a 15 mL conical tube as a pooled population with prewarmed DMEM with 10% FBS and antibiotics to prevent contamination.Confirmation of positive clonesFreeze at least one vial of single cell clones as a backup before using them for confirmation.Clones can be confirmed by Western blot analysis using protein-specific antibody or mNG antibody. The correct fusion protein should have an apparent molecular mass ~25 kD larger than the parental protein. It is also important to sequence the region around the site of mNG sequence insertion to make sure there are no unwanted insertions or deletions during homology repair.Note: Head-to-head comparison of efficiency of different delivery methods was not performed. In all the cases, the yield of mNG positive cells as determined during flow sorting was 0.1% to 0.5%.",
    "Since we were interested in single cell colonies for screening, one 96 well plate of single sorted cells was sufficient to screen them. It should be noted that flow sorting could inadvertently result in clones expressing higher yields of fusion protein."
