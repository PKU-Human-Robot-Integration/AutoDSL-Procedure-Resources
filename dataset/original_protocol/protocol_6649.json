    "Prepare all solutions and mixtures at room temperature. All sample processing is conducted using Nitrile gloves. Anaerobic condition is not necessary. Saliva collectionSubjects with a primary disease without a history of prior malignancy.Subjects who did not receive any prior treatment in the form of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, or alternative therapy.The saliva providers were not allowed to take any food except water intake after 9:00 p.m. on the previous day.All samples were collected from 8:00 to 11:00 a.m.The subjects were required to brush their teeth without toothpaste on the day of saliva collection and had to refrain from drinking water, smoking, tooth-brushing, and intense exercise 1 h before saliva collection.They were required to gargle with water just before saliva collection.Approximately 400 μl of unstimulated saliva was collected in a 50 cc polypropylene tube (see Note 1).A polypropylene straw 1.1 cm in diameter was used to assist the saliva collection.After collection, saliva samples were immediately stored at -80 °C.Processing of saliva samples.The overview of saliva processing is depicted in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201014/20201014020124_9704.jpgFigure 1. A protocol of saliva processingA frozen saliva sample is thawed at 4 °C.100 μl of the saliva sample is moved to a 1.5-ml tube with a 5-kDa cutoff filter using a pipet.The tube is centrifuged at 9,100 × g for 3 h at 4 °C to eliminate large molecules.If the filtrate is not less than 45 μl (Figure 2), the rest of the raw saliva samples should be processed independently (Steps B2 and B3) and the filtrate should be merged.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201014/20201014020320_4563.jpgFigure 2. A tube with a filter. The filtrate of 45 μl is shown.45 μl of the filtrate is moved to a 1.5 ml of microtube using a pipet.",
    "5 μl of water containing an internal standards mixture (Recipe 1) was added to the tube using a pipet, mixed 30 s using vortex, and centrifuged at 4,550 × g for 1 min at 4 °C to mix well.7 μl of the mixture is transferred to a vial and the vial is covered with a snap cap.Setup for the cation measurementCECapillary: Fused-silica, i.d. 50 μm × 100 cmBuffer: 1 M Formic acidVoltage: Positive, 30 kVTemperature: 20 °CInjection: Pressure injection 50 mbar, 5 s (approximately 5 nl)TOFMSIon Source: Electrospray ionization (ESI)Polarity: PositiveCapillary voltage: 4,000 VFragmentor: 75 VSkimmer: 50 VOCT RFV: 500 VDrying gas: N2, 10 L/minDrying gas temp.: 300 °CNebulizer gas press.: 7 psigSheath liquid: Cation sheath liquid (Recipe 2)Flow rate: 10 μl/minLock mass: 2MeOH13Cisotope m/z 66.063061 and Hexakis(2,2-difluoroethoxy)phosphazene m/z 622.028963Setup for the anion measurementCECapillary: COSMO(+), i.d. 50 μm × 105 cmBuffer: 50 mM Ammonium acetate, pH 8.5Voltage: Negative, 30 kVTemperature: 20 °CInjection: Pressure injection 50 mbar, 30 s (approximately 30 nl)Preconditioning: 2 min at 50 mM Ammonium acetate, pH 3.4 and 5 min at run bufferTOFMSIon Source: ESIPolarity: NegativeCapillary voltage: 3,500 VFragmentor: 100 VSkimmer: 50 VOCT RFV: 200 VDrying gas: N2, 10 L/minDrying gas temp.: 300 °CNebulizer gas press.: 7 psigSheath liquid: Anion sheath liquid (see Recipes)Flow rate: 10 μl/minLock mass: 2CH3COOH13C isotope m/z 120.038339, Hexakis(2,2-difluoroethoxy)phosphazene+CH3COOH m/z 680.035541ESI needle: PlatinumMeasurementSample preconditioningCation for standard mixtures: 4 min at a cation run buffer (see Recipes).Cation for samples: 5 min at Ammonium Formate, 5 min at Milli-Q, and 5 min at an anion run buffer (Recipe 3).Anion for standard mixtures and samples: 2 min at 50 mM Ammonium acetate, pH 3.4, and 5 min at a cation run buffer (Recipe 3).Three samples and a standard mixture are measured for accessing the quality.",
    "Evaluate the stability of the total ion electrophoresis (TIE) (Figures 3 and 4). If the TIE is unstable, adjust the ESI sprayer until the intensities of the TIE becomes steady.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201014/20201014020350_6340.jpgFigure 3. An example of the stable TIE of the cation measurement. The X-axis indicates the migration time. The Y-axis indicates the intensities of TIE, the sum of intensities over the m/z range in the observed data. Under the successful conditioning, this line becomes flat except for a few parts. Two significant drops of the TIE are observed at the left because of the existence of the inorganic cations, such as Na+ and K+. Two large peaks are observed of the existence of neutral molecules. The other small alternations are negligible and the flat of the other part indicates the stability of the conditioning.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201014/20201014020459_8461.jpgFigure 4. An example of the unstable TIE of the cation measurement. Compared to the TIE line in Figure 3, the line here fluctuates, which indicate the unsuccessful conditioning. Most of the cases, the adjustment of ESI sprayer is not suitable and the electric current fluctuates, which causes such TIE fluctuations.Evaluate the stability of electric current during the measurement (Figures 5 and 6). Dilute the final solution and measure the sample again if the TIE is unstable.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201014/20201014020542_3300.jpgFigure 5. An example of the stable electric current of the cation measurement. The X-axis indicates the migration time. The Y-axis indicates the electric current during the measurement. Under the successful measurement, this line becomes flat except for the start of the measurement.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201014/20201014020556_9505.jpgFigure 6. An example of the unstable electric current of the cation measurement. The X-axis indicates the migration time. The Y-axis indicates the electric current during the measurement. This example shows many spike peaks. When the condition of capillary becomes abnormal, the line doesn't stay flat.Measure saliva samples."
