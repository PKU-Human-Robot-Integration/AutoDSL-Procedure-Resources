  "procedures": [
    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n1. Preoperative procedures\nSterilize surgical instruments. Autoclave all surgical instruments before surgery. If performing multiple surgeries on the same day, sterilize instruments between surgeries using a dry bead sterilizer.\nPrepare therapeutic in 25% Pluronic-127 gel (diluted in sterile distilled water).\nSet up a 2F Fogarty balloon catheter to the insufflator and place the balloon end of the catheter in a 1 mL syringe filled with saline solution.\nInduce anesthesia by placing the rat in a chamber with 5% isoflurane.\n\t\nRemove the rat from the chamber and record the rat’s weight. Use hair clippers to shave fur on the ventral neck region.\nPlace the rat back into the chamber with 5% isoflurane to ensure induction of anesthesia.\nPlace the rat supine on a surgical platform, inserting the face into the nose cone so that the rat face is toward the surgeon.\n\t\nReduce inhalational anesthesia to 1.5% isoflurane. Verify the depth of anesthesia by a toe-pinch reflex on all four feet.\nTape all four legs down to the surgical platform.\nTurn on the heat lamp.\nInject Atropine (0.01 mg/kg) subcutaneously to reduce airway secretions.\nInject Carprofen (5 mg/kg) subcutaneously for prophylactic pain management. If anti-inflammatory drugs are not acceptable for the experiment refer to steps 3.2.2 and 3.2.3.\nApply lubricant eye ointment to both eyes using a sterile cotton swab to prevent corneas from drying during surgery.\nSwab the neck three times in a circular motion alternating between 70% ethyl alcohol followed by Betadine from the center of the shaved region outwards to sterilize the incision site.\nInfiltrate the incision line s.c. with 0.25% bupivacaine.\nPut on sterile surgical gloves before handling sterile surgical instruments and supplies.",
    "Lay out all autoclaved surgical instruments on a sterile surgical sheet.\nCut three independent 1 inch strands of sterile 7-0 Prolene suture.\nPlace cotton swabs and gauze on surgical sheet.\nDrape the rat with a sterile surgical sheet that only exposes the sterilized neck region.\nCut an additional small opening in sheet that exposes part of the nose cone. This will be the site for taping down the balloon catheter during injury.\n2. Operative procedures\nDuring the entire surgical procedure, assess depth of anesthesia by monitoring the respiratory rate (rate should be consistent and deemed normal) as well by toe pinch every 15 min. If respiratory rate increases or there is a response to the toe pinch, then pause surgical manipulation and increase isoflurane up to 2.5%.\nExpose the common carotid artery (CCA).\n\t\nMake a superficial, straight, longitudinal neckline incision between the jaw bones of the rat. Incision will be approximately 1.5-2 cm in length.\nMake an incision through the connective tissue under the skin until the muscle layer is exposed. Displace the salivary glands underneath the skin to access the muscle tissue.\nBluntly separate the connective tissue from the muscle by inserting closed scissors between the muscle layer and connective tissue and gently opening the scissor while pulling the skin upward.\nDissect the two visible muscles (sternohyoid and sternomastoid) longitudinally along the left side of the trachea until a third muscle (omohyoid) that runs perpendicular to the two superficial muscles is observed.\nUse forceps to create a window separating this perpendicular muscle (omohyoid) from the longitudinal muscle (sternohyoid) running atop the trachea. Gently perform this separation to prevent blunt trauma to the trachea.\nReach forceps underneath the perpendicular muscle and cut to separate the two longitudinal muscles and expose the CCA.\nDissect the CCA.",
    "Dissect the CCA near the bifurcation until the internal carotid artery (ICA) and external carotid artery (ECA) are exposed.\nDissect the superior thyroid artery (STA), which branches from the ECA.\nUsing the pre-cut Prolene sutures, ligate the STA and the ECA near their respective bifurcation. Leave the majority of the suture to one side of the knot and grab each suture with a curved hemostat.\nFinish dissecting around the ICA, reach forceps underneath and around the ICA, and use a non-crushing vascular clamp to achieve distal control. Clamp the occipital artery together with the ICA.\nDissect the CCA proximal to the bifurcation, ensuring to separate the vagus nerve from the CCA.\nReach forceps underneath and around the CCA and use a non-crushing vascular clamp to achieve proximal control. Place clamp at least 5 mm from the bifurcation.\nPerform balloon injury.\n\t\nManeuver the curved hemostats holding each ligated artery branch to expose the bifurcation between the ECA and superior branch.\nGently dissect tissue at the bifurcation and then make an arteriotomy incision between the ECA and superior branch using microdissection scissors.\nUse a cotton swab to push all blood out of the CCA and clean up the arteriotomy site.\nInsert the uninflated balloon catheter through the arteriotomy and advance into the CCA until the proximal end of the balloon is past the bifurcation.\nTape catheter to the nose cone so the balloon does not slip out of the artery during inflation.\nSlowly inflate the balloon to 5 atmospheres of pressure and leave in the CCA for 5 min to induce arterial injury. Ensure that the pressure stays constant for the entire 5 min.\nAfter 5 min, deflate balloon and gently remove from the CCA through the arteriotomy.",
    "Flush the CCA by gently squeezing on the clamp at the CCA. Do not remove the clamp.\nLigate the ECA proximal to the arteriotomy and then remove the clamps from the CCA and ICA to restore blood flow through the CCA to the ICA. Ensure there is no visible bleeding around the arteriotomy and that the CCA is pulsating.\nApply 100 µL of therapeutic or Pluronic gel vehicle alone periadventitially along the injured CCA. Do so by applying 50 µL to the left side of the CCA and then 50 µL to the right side of the CCA to ensure even coating of the injured artery.\nClose the wound site.\n\t\nCut excess Prolene sutures.\nClose the wound using interrupted 4-0 or 6-0 vicryl layers along the connective tissue.\nFinish closing the wound using running 4-0 nylon suture along the skin.\n3. Postoperative procedures\nPlace the rat alone in a clean cage with half the cage under a heating lamp and monitor until rat regains sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Keep the rat in a separate cage until the animal is fully alert and mobile before transferring back to their original cage.\nMonitor the rat daily for the next three days and then three times per week until euthanasia. Euthanize using isoflurane overdose followed by bilateral thoracotomy as described below.\n\t\nUtilize the National Centre for the Replacement Refinement & Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs) grimace scale to identify postoperative pain levels. If any animal appears to be experiencing pain or develop any neurologic compromise, sacrifice immediately.\nFor animals that do not receive carprofen, administer acetaminophen 6 mg/mL in their drinking water 24 h prior to surgery through 48 h post-surgery. Acetaminophen provides analgesia with minimal anti-inflammatory effects.",
    "Alternatively, other analgesia strategies with minimal anti-inflammatory effects can be used, such as buprenorphine or buprenorphine extended release. Consult the veterinary team at your institution.\n4. Tissue harvest and imaging\nTwo weeks after surgery, euthanize the rat by overdose of anesthesia (5% isoflurane). Alternatively, euthanize rats at an earlier time point to analyze the various aspects of the arterial injury response.\n\t\nOnce breathing stops perform bilateral thoracotomy as a secondary method of euthanasia.\nMake a lateral incision through the abdomen, and then cut upwards, through the diaphragm and ribs, exposing the thoracic cavity.\nPerfuse and fix the arteries.\n\t\nInsert an 18 G cannula attached to a gravitational perfusion-fixation system through the left ventricle. Maintain equivalent pressure between rats by marking the height of the perfusion system relative to the benchtop (120 cm elevation, equivalent to 91 ± 3 mmHg).\nClamp the cannula together with the ventricle using a curved hemostat.\nMake a cut in the right atrium, opening the vascular circuit, and begin perfusion with PBS followed by 2-4% paraformaldehyde (about 250 mL each).\nPrepare paraformaldehyde diluted in PBS the day of sacrifice, or at most the night before sacrifice. If preparing on the day of sacrifice, ensure paraformaldehyde has cooled to room temperature before beginning the perfusion. Store paraformaldehyde at 4 °C.\nAfter fixation, extract the left and right carotid arteries and store at 4 °C for 2 h in 2-4% paraformaldehyde.\nTransfer arteries to 30% sucrose and store overnight at 4 °C.\nAfter 16-24 h, embed the arteries in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound and freeze OCT-embedded artery blocks.",
    "Condition arteries in OCT at room temperature for 10 min. Place the artery parallel to the plane of the cryomold filled with OCT, marking the side of the cryomold to which the arterial bifurcation is facing. Snap-freeze in liquid nitrogen.\nStore frozen blocks long-term at -80 °C.\nSection frozen blocks using a cryostat.\n\t\nCollect six 5 µm thick arterial cross sections per slide, with slide 1 starting at the bifurcation.\nSection frozen blocks until hyperplasia no longer visible (around 100 slides).\nHematoxylin & eosin (H&E) stain slides18\nFind the area of injury by staining one in every ten slides along the entire artery starting from the bifurcation (e.g., slides 1, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100).\nStain additional slides around the site of injury to find the slide with peak occlusion (e.g., slides 20, 30, and 40 had visible hyperplasia, thus stain slides 15, 25, 35, and 45).\nStain and quantify the slide with peak occlusion and equidistant slides before and after the peak occlusion slide (e.g., peak occlusion found at slide 35, then stain and quantify slides 25, 45, etc.) for a total of 3-10 slides per rat.\nFor light sheet fluorescence microscopy imaging, store arteries overnight at 4 °C after fixation in step 4.4.\n\t\nProbe artery with 1:500 dilution of rabbit anti-CD31 primary antibody in diluent (pH 7.4) for 3 days. Then counterstain artery with 1:500 dilution of anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 secondary antibody for 2 days19.\nClear the artery using iDISCO+20.\nImage the artery using a light sheet fluorescence microscope21. Render images using software (e.g., Imaris)19.\nQuantify neointimal hyperplasia. Perform quantification in a blinded manner if possible.",
    "Use ImageJ software to trace the perimeter of the intima, internal elastic lamina (IEL), and external elastic lamina (EEL) of an artery on each of the 3-10 slides determined above (step 4.8.3).\nQuantify the area of each traced region in ImageJ and export these values. The intima trace yields the lumen area, the IEL trace yields the IEL area, and the EEL trace yields the EEL area.\nAverage the values obtained from the 3-10 slides to get the average injury (% occlusion, intima:media (I:M) ratio, neointimal hyperplasia) per rat carotid artery.\nNeointimal Hyperplasia = IEL area - Lumen area\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60473/60473eq1.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60473/60473eq2.jpg\nSubscription Required.
