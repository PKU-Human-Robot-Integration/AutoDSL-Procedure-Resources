    "The information below is based on current safety and regulatory standards at the University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA. As a safety precaution, refer to the institution's biological safety program and the most current regulations and recommendations before working with human tissue.",
    "CAUTION: Human tissue can be a source of blood-borne pathogens, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and others. Working with human tissue poses the risk of infection from blood-borne pathogens. Therefore, certain regulatory and safety considerations are imperative when working with human tissue to protect laboratory personnel. Working with human tissue in the US requires a biosafety level 2 laboratory as well as safety precautions and training in accordance with NIH Section IV-B-7, OSHA Act of 1970 Clause 5(a)(1) and the user's institutional biological safety program. In general, Institutional Biosafety Committee and/or Institutional Review Board approval must be obtained prior to conducting any research involving human materials (tissue, body fluids). The training is required for all personnel working with human materials and includes basic laboratory safety training, e.g., Chemical Hygiene and Laboratory Safety, as well as specific training on biological safety, hazardous waste, and human blood-borne pathogens. All personnel working with human materials are highly recommended to obtain Hepatitis B vaccinations, prior to working with human materials. Personnel are required to wear specific personal protective equipment while working with human materials, e.g., a cuffed lab coat and a face shield, and wear gloves at all times. All work is performed in a biosafety cabinet (class 2). All equipment that comes in contact with human materials and any waste from human materials is handled appropriately to prevent contamination and/or infection of personnel. All equipment and surfaces are cleaned with 10% bleach and 75% ethanol following each procedure involving human materials. A spill with human materials must be immediately cleaned up. Glassware is autoclaved after each use. Waste, including unfixed human tissue, is collected in a labeled biohazard waste bag and autoclaved. Sharps are collected in a puncture- and leak-proof container labeled as biohazardous.",
    "All waste from human materials is disposed according to the institution's biological safety regulations.",
    "NOTE: Our laboratory obtains fresh frontal cortex samples from deceased individuals through the Sanders-Brown Center on Aging (IRB #B15-2602-M). Inclusion criteria are: enrollment in the UK-ADC longitudinal autopsy cohort study and a Post-Mortem Interval (PMI) ≤4 h64. Autopsies follow a standard protocol and all procedures conform to NIH Biospecimen Best Practice Guidelines65. A short PMI of less than 4 h is of highest importance to ensure capillary viability after isolation. Both fresh and frozen tissue can be used. If freezing is necessary, freshly obtained human brain tissue should be shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Fresh or thawed tissue should be stored in isolation buffer (see below) and processed quickly. We find that 10 g of fresh human tissue yields about 100 mg of brain capillaries (wet weight).\n1. Setup\nBuffer preparation\n\tNOTE: The volume of buffer needed depends on the amount of tissue. All buffer volumes in the following protocol are based on 10 g of human brain cortex tissue.\n\t\nL Isolation Buffer: Use 1.5 L of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS; 2.7 mM KCl, 1.47 mM KH2PO4, 136.9 mM NaCl, 8.1 mM Na2HPO4, 0.9 mM CaCl2, 0.49 mM MgCl2) and supplement with 5 mM D-glucose (1.35 g) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (0.165 g). After adding the glucose and pyruvate, adjust to pH 7.4 with sodium hydroxide. Cool and store the buffer to 4 °C prior to use.\nBovine Serum Albumin (BSA): Add 10 g of BSA powder to 1 L of isolation buffer to a final BSA concentration of 1%. Stir slowly to avoid bubbles, adjust to pH 7.4, and store at 4 °C overnight. Immediately prior to use, gently stir; avoid forming bubbles to avoid albumin denaturation.",
    "density gradient medium: Weigh 18 g of density gradient medium into a glass bottle and add a magnetic stir bar. Add 60 mL of isolation buffer and shake vigorously for 5 min until all powder is suspended. Store overnight at 4 °C to allow the density gradient medium to dissolve. Stir for 10 min right before use.\nStore all buffers at 4 °C; keep all tools and buffers on ice during the entire isolation procedure. Stir all buffers before use.\nExperimental setup\nMount the pestle of the Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder onto the electronic overhead stirrer. Place the Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder and the Dounce homogenizer with pestle on ice under the hood. Prepare a 300 µm filter mesh (5 x 5 cm2), fold it to a cone, and insert and attach it to a 50 mL Falcon tube with tape (Figure 1A).\nPlace connecting rings and cell strain filters (pore size: 30 µm) on 50 mL Falcon tubes. Prepare biohazardous waste bags. Place all required equipment in the biosafety cabinet (see Table of Materials).\n2. Brain Sample Preparation\nNOTE: Figure 1A shows the workflow chart of the entire isolation procedure described below. Human brain tissue can stem from any part of the cortex and can be used fresh or frozen. Frozen brain tissue can be thawed at room temperature (no buffer; ~30 min for 10 g). To achieve comparable results, the brain tissue should be obtained from the same brain region for each experiment. This protocol is optimized for fresh (PMI <4 h) human cerebral cortex that has not been frozen.",
    "Preparation of human brain tissue: Document the weight of the brain tissue. All numbers in the following protocol are appropriate for 10 g of fresh human brain tissue. Place the brain tissue in a 100 mm Petri dish. Carefully remove all the meninges with forceps. Use a scalpel to cut off the white matter.\nMincing of the human brain tissue: Carefully cut up the brain tissue and mince it with a scalpel. Mince for about 5 min (2–3 mm pieces). Transfer the brain tissue to the Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder. Add 30 mL of isolation buffer.\n\tNOTE: The minced tissue pieces are difficult to see since the brain tissue turns into mush through the mincing process.\n3. Homogenization\nPotter-Elvehjem tissue grinder (clearance: 150–230 µm): Homogenize each sample with 100 strokes at a homogenizer speed of 50 rpm. Document the time every 25 strokes and the total time needed for 100 strokes. See Table 1 for a proposed homogenization protocol; the total time for homogenizing 10 g of human frontal cortex is about 22 min. Do not stir in air to prevent bubbles.\nDounce homogenizer (clearance: 80–130 µm): Transfer the homogenate to a Dounce homogenizer on ice. Homogenize the suspension with 20 strokes (~6 s/stroke, total of ~2 min). Avoid bubbles.\n4. Centrifugation\nDistribute the brain homogenate equally into four 50 mL centrifugation tubes and document the total volume of the homogenate. Distribute 50 mL of density gradient buffer into the centrifugation tubes (12.5 mL per tube). Use 10 mL of isolation buffer to rinse the pestle and homogenizer, and distribute into the four centrifugation tubes (~2.5 mL per tube).",
    "Tightly close the centrifuge tubes with caps. Mix the homogenate, density gradient medium, and buffer by vigorously shaking the tubes. Centrifuge at 5,800 x g for 15 min at 4 °C (fixed angle rotor); select a medium deceleration speed to keep the pellet attached to the tube. Discard the supernatant and resuspend each pellet in 2 mL of 1% BSA.\n5. Filtration\nNOTE: To separate the capillaries from red blood cells and other cell debris, several filtration steps are necessary.\n300 µm mesh: After re-suspending the pellet, filter the suspension through the 300 µm mesh. Capillaries are filtered through the mesh, whereas larger vessels and larger brain debris remain on the mesh. Carefully wash the mesh with up to 50 mL of 1% BSA. Discard the mesh.\n\tNOTE: This filtration step clears the capillary suspension from any larger vessels or chunks of brain debris.\n30 µM cell strain filter\n\tNOTE: This filtration step separates capillaries from red blood cells and other brain debris.\n\t\nDistribute the capillary filtrate from step 6.1 over the five 30 µm cell strain filters (about 10 mL of capillary filtrate per cell strain filter). Capillaries are held back by this filter, whereas red blood cells, other single cells, and small brain debris pass through the filter and are collected in the filtrate.\nWash each filter with 25 mL of 1% BSA. Afterwards, pour all filtrates over the sixth filter to increase the yield. Wash each filter with 50 mL of 1% BSA; keep the cell strain filters with containing the capillaries and discard the filtrate.\n6. Capillary Collection",
    "Turn the filters upside down and wash the capillaries with 50 mL of 1% BSA for each filter into 50 mL tubes. Gently apply pressure with the pipet tip of a 5 mL pipettor and move it across the filter to wash off the brain capillaries.\nMake sure to wash off all brain capillaries, especially from the rim of the filter. Avoid bubbles since this makes the filtration process more difficult and increases the chance of capillary loss.\n7. Washing\nAfter collecting the capillaries, centrifuge all samples at 1,500 x g for 3 min at 4 °C (swinging bucket rotor). Remove the supernatant and re-suspend the pellet in approximately 3 mL of isolation buffer. Combine all resuspended pellets from one sample in a 15 mL conical tube and fill it with isolation buffer. Centrifuge again at 1,500 x g for 3 min at 4 °C and wash two more times.\nDocument the capillary purity with a microscope (100X magnification) and camera (Figure 1B).\n\tNOTE: The brain capillary yield from 10 g of human brain tissue is usually about 100 mg. The isolated brain capillaries can now be used for experiments, processed (e.g., lysate, membrane isolation), or be flash-frozen and stored at -80 °C in cryotubes for a minimum of 6–12 months (avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles).\nSubscription Required.
