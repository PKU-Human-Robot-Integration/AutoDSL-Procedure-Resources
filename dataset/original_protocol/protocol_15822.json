  "procedures": [
    "All experiments, including animal handling and tissue collection, were carried out in accordance with the University of Florida and the City College of New York Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), following the approved protocol 201508873 (UF) and 1071 (CCNY). For reagents and buffer please refer to the Supplementary File.\n1. Prepare acute rat brain slices\nNOTE: In this experiment adult male rats (250-350 g) were used. However, this set up is functional for different developmental points, female rats, and other species. If using a smaller animal, such as mice, the experimenter may adjust to optimize the protocol by using a different number of brain slices or punches per condition. Dissection buffer will be referred to as Buffer 1; efflux buffer will be referred to as Buffer 2.\nPrepare Buffer 1 as mentioned in the Supplementary File. Saturate Buffer 1 with oxygen by bubbling with 95%/5% (O2/CO2) for 20 min on ice. Remove 50 mL of Buffer 1, and chill on ice in a small beaker or a Petri dish. This buffer is used to hold the acutely harvested whole brain.\nAnesthetize one or two adult rats (250-350 g) with 1%-2% isoflurane, decapitate them using a guillotine, and rapidly remove their brains. Immediately place the brain in ice-cold oxygenated Buffer 1 in the container from step 1.1.\n\tNOTE: Ensure isoflurane and guillotine are used safely. Open isoflurane under a fume hood.\nUsing a vibratome or compresstome, cut 300 µm coronal brain sections from each region of interest (Figure 1). Bubbling Buffer 1 must be present while sections are being made. Using a stainless-steel spatula, carefully and immediately transfer brain slices into a new Petri dish filled with ice-cold oxygenated Buffer 1 (Figure 2).",
    "Further dissect brain slices (e.g., punches, cut out) by carefully moving the slices to glass slides (Figure 1G) using rat brain atlas57. For instance, identify the dorsal striatum based off its dark, striated structure, and identify the hippocampus based off its proximity to the cortex and unique spiral structure. The right and left hemispheres may be separated to use as control and experimental slices (Figures 2G - H). Here, the dorsal striatum was further dissected into 2 mm punches (Figure 1G).\nUsing a plastic transfer pipette with the tip cut off, transfer slices or brain punches into small containers immersed in oxygenated ice-cold Buffer 1 with oxygen bubbling. These containers may be stainless steel mesh, or small Petri dishes filled with buffer (Figure 1H).\n2. Ex-vivo endogenous monoamine release from brain slices or punches\nNOTE: The device used for this section consists of a 48-well plate and a tissue holder made of six microcentrifuge filter units without the inset-filters connected to a carbogen line (Figure 2). To make the holder, use a sturdy plastic rod (e.g., from a cell scrapper) and super glue the microcentrifuge filter units without the inset-filters to it. Let it dry for 1-2 days. Time required for the endogenous monoamine release experiment and concentrations of amphetamine, fluoxetine, and cocaine are based on the current literature and previous protocols13,20,58.\nTissue activation\nTransfer the brain tissue from step 1.1.5 to each well of the efflux chamber and allow recovery for 30-50 min at 37 °C on a slide warmer in 0.5-1 mL of oxygenated Buffer 2, with constant, gentle bubbling (Figure 2B1).\nDuring this incubation, dilute the drugs to the desired concentration for the experiment. All the drugs must be dissolved in Buffer 2, and concentrations are based off the current literature.\nFirst incubation",
    "Move the tissue holder with brain tissue to wells containing 500 µL of oxygenated Buffer 2 and incubate for 20 min at 37 °C. Ensure that minimal to no buffer is transported over by tapping the holder on the edge of the well until no excess buffer is in the holder.\nIn experiments with pharmacological agents such as monoamine transporter inhibitors, incubate the tissue samples with the drugs diluted in oxygenated Buffer 2 (e.g., 10 µM Fluoxetine, 40 µM cocaine; see Figure 2B2). The final volume in each well will be 500 µL.\nSecond incubation\nMove the holder with the tissue to a new set of wells containing 500 µL total Buffer 2 with or without the desired concentration of each drug. Ensure there is no excess buffer leftover. Each well represents an n = 1 for experimental conditions. Each experimental condition is performed in triplicate.\nOne well includes an oxygenated Buffer 2, the next 10-30 µM AMPH, and the final well includes 10-30 µM AMPH plus monoamine transporter inhibitors. Each drug is dissolved in oxygenated Buffer 2.\nIncubate the tissue for 20 min at 37 °C with 500 µL of the drug condition.\n\t\t​NOTE: Additional wells may include an oxygenated high K+ Buffer 2 with or without the monoamine transporter inhibitors. Dissolve each drug in the oxygenated Buffer 2 (500 µL).\nDuring this second incubation of 20 min, collect the solution from the wells from the first incubation in step 2.2.1 and transfer to microcentrifuge tubes containing 50 µL of 1 N perchloric acid or phosphoric acid (dependent on the type of HPLC, final concentration 0.1 N). The final volume of the sample will be 550 µL. Maintain microcentrifuge tubes on ice, and label the tubes #1.",
    "After the second incubation of 20 min, move the tissue holder with brain sections or punches to an empty well and maintain the plate on ice. Transfer the supernatant to microcentrifuge tubes containing 50 µL of 1 N perchloric acid or phosphoric acid. The final volume of the sample will be 550 µL. Maintain microcentrifuge tubes on ice, and label the tubes #2.\nAdd 1 mL of ice-cold Buffer 1 to each well containing tissue. Collect all of the tissue using small tweezers, and transfer to clean microcentrifuge tubes.\nMaintain tubes with brain tissue at -80 °C. Discard the 1 mL of Buffer 1 (Figure 2B4).\nFilter solutions obtained from each incubation using microcentrifuge filter tubes (0.22 µm) at 2,500 x g for 2min. Use the filtrate to determine monoamine content using HPLC with electrochemical detection (Figure 2B5).\n3. Tissue viability\nMTT assay\n\t​NOTE: A significant concern regarding this experimental setup is tissue viability as the tissue may be used for up to several hours59. An MTT assay60,61 is used to determine tissue viability by the end of the experimentation. This assay is based on the conversion of the yellow tetrazolium salt MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) to purple formazan crystals by viable cells with adequate metabolism.\n\t\nPost experiment maintain a separate group of tissue samples and separate them into two groups.\nIncubate one group for 20 min at 37 °C in Triton X-100 (1%) dissolved in Buffer 2 as a control. Triton X-100 treatment results in cell death. Maintain the second group in Buffer 2, and do not incubate in Triton X-100 (tissue viability control).\nAdd MTT (stock solution 5 mg/mL in PBS, pH 7.4) to both groups in the oxygenated Buffer 2 to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL.",
    "Incubate the tissue samples for 20 min at 37 °C, wash with PBS, and transfer into microcentrifuge tubes containing 250 µL of a mixture of SDS (10%, w/v), DMF (25%, v/v), and water to dissolve the formazan crystals.\nIncubate the samples for 24 h.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 10,000 x g for 10 min and measure the absorbance of the supernatant (200 µL) at 562 nm and 690 nm using a microplate reader. Tissue viability is calculated as follows: (A562-A690)/tissue weight.\n4. HPLC analysis of monoamines\nQuantify monoamine release from each experimental condition using HPLC-ECD according to previous protocols13,44, using a reverse phase column.\n\t\nPrepare the mobile phase required for detection. This consists of 100 mM phosphoric acid, 100 mM citric acid, 0.1 mM EDTA-Na2, 600 mg/L octanesulfonic acid, 8% v/v acetonitrile (final pH 6.0). The composition of the mobile phase is dependent on type of HPLC and column used.\nSet the potential of the electrochemical detector (2 mm glassy carbon electrode,) to 0.46 V, and set the flow rate to 0.05 mL/min.\nLoad 5 µL of each sample, including neurotransmitter standards into the HPLC for autoinjection and detection. The amount of each sample added depends on the type of HPLC used.\nOnce the HPLC has completed the run, use the given HPLC analysis software to acquire and analyze the chromatograph data.\nAnalyze monoamine content using a standard curve composed of each monoamine (Dopamine: DA, Norepinephrine: NE, and Serotonin: 5-HT; Figure 2C). Use the resulting chromatograms to obtain the area under the curve (AUC) based on the manufacturer's guidelines.\n5. Preparing tissue lysates for protein quantification\nProtein assay",
    "Add ice-cold lysis buffer plus protease inhibitors (0.1 g/1 mL) to each microcentrifuge tube containing brain sections/punches and homogenize using a pestle homogenizer. The microcentrifuge tubes must be maintained on ice while homogenizing to prevent protein degradation.\nIncubate tissue homogenates for 1 h at 4 °C with light rotation.\nCentrifuge tissue homogenates at 16,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C and recover the supernatant.\nDetermine protein concentration in the supernatants, with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard.\nNormalize the monoamine content in each brain sample to the total content of protein (µg) measured in 250 µL of brain tissue lysed. Use the below formula to determine the nmol monoamine/g protein. df = dilution factor.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62127/62127eq01.jpg\n6. Statistical analysis\nAnalyze monoamine release (nmol/g) using one-way ANOVA followed by Sidak's multiple comparisons test for post-hoc comparisons.\nAnalyze tissue viability using an Unpaired Student's t-test for independent groups (Control vs. 1% Triton X-100).\nFor all statistical analyses, set the alpha level to ≤ 0.05.\nSubscription Required.
