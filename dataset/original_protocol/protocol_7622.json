    "Preparation for immunofluorescence fixation Seed SAS, HaCaT, HUVEC, or HepG2 cells on culture medium in a 6-well plate. For SAS and HaCaT cells, seed 3 × 105 cells/well. Seed cells at 60% confluency. For SAS, HaCaT, and HepG2 cells, use DMEM with 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 10% FBS, and 0.5% trypsin-EDTA as culture medium. For HUVEC cells, use EGM2 as culture medium.On the next day, transduce lentiviruses that knockdown or over-express STK40 into seeded SAS, HaCaT, HUVEC, or HepG2 cells. The lentiviruses are generated by transfecting vectors of (1) shRNA plasmid targeting STK40 bought from Academia Sinica or (2) plasmid of over-expression construct targeting STK40 into HEK-293T cells. For our over-expression construct of STK40, YFP is tagged at the cytoplasmic domain of STK40 to ensure fluorescent visibility under the microscope.Select cells in a 6-well plate with antibiotics such as puromycin or blasticidin over 24–48 h.On the same day of antibiotics selection, perform collagen coating in a new 96-well plate or 4- or 8-well chamber slide. Coat poly-D-lysine 100 μg/mL in PBS for 5 min at 37 °C. Wash SAS, HaCaT, HUVEC, or HepG2 cells with PBS and then coat cells with bovine collagen 100 μg/mL in PBS. Collagen coating ensures better cell attachment for cell migration and subsequent observation of focal adhesion. Incubate chamber slides or 96-well plates at 37 °C overnight.On the next day, re-seed cells from the 6-well plate onto the coated 96-well plate or 4- or 8-well chamber slide. To observe nascent and prominent FAs, the transduced cells are re-seeded differently:To observe nascent FAs: seed cells at a higher density at 70%–80% confluency to perform wound scratch. The FAs on the first row of the wound will be analyzed later. For SAS cells, seed 2–3 × 104 cells per 96-well plate and 1.",
    "5 × 105 cells per 4-well chamber slide. For HaCaT cells, seed 1 × 104 cells per 96-well plate and 5 × 104 per 4-well chamber slide.To observe prominent FAs: seed cells at a lower density at 40% confluency. Cells will perform random migration and all of their prominent FAs will be analyzed later. For SAS cells, seed 6,000 cells per 96-well plate and 3 × 104 cells per 4-well chamber slide. For HaCaT cells, seed 5,000 cells per 96-well plate and 2.5 × 104 cells per 4-well chamber slide. The prominent FAs of HaCaT cells are shown as demonstration in this protocol.Incubate cells at 37 °C in supplemented medium with or without drugs according to their groups. The supplemented medium contains 20 mM HEPES, 0.1% BSA, 25 ng/mL FGF1, and 10 U of heparin. The experimental groups include untreated and drug-treated groups.Untreated group.Drug-treated groups:i. Blebbistatin (5 μM): inhibits myosin II.ii. Y27632 (5 μM): inhibits ROCK (Rho-kinase). Blebbistain or Y27632 are added to inhibit force-mediated FA. The FA results from the co-inhibition of STK40, and force-generating FA tell us whether the effect of STK40 on FA is due to force-mediated FA strengthening.iii. Trametinib (100 nM): inhibits MAPK kinase. The FA results from the co-inhibition of STK40, and MAPK kinase tell us whether MAPK is involved in the effect of STK40 on FA.iv. Leptomycin (100 nM): inhibits exportin to block nuclear exportation. The blockage of nuclear export by leptomycin renders the accumulation of our other target protein, YAP (Yes-associated protein), in the nucleus. The FA results of the co-inhibition of STK40 and exportin provide partial clues for us to explore whether the spatial distribution of YAP is involved in the effect of STK40 on FA.v. Verteporfin (2.5 μM): inhibits YAP activity.",
    "The FA results from the co-inhibition of STK40, and YAP tell us whether YAP is involved in the effect of STK40 on FA. Furthermore, the FA results of the inhibition of STK40, YAP, and MAPK support the STK40-YAP-MAPK system on FA in our published paper (Yu et al., 2021).To observe nascent and prominent FAs, the duration of drug treatment is different.To observe nascent FAs, treat cells with drugs as follows:i. 5 μM blebbistatin, 5 μM Y27632, or 100 nM trametinib: overnightii. 100 nM leptomycin B: 1 hiii. 2.5 μM verteporfin: 6 h.Go to steps 7–10 in this section to create wound scratch.To observe prominent FAs, treat cells with drugs as follows:i. 5 μM blebbistatin, 5 μM Y27632, or 100 nM trametinib: overnightii. 100 nM leptomycin B: 3 hiii. 2.5 μM verteporfin: 8 h.Go directly to section B for fixation.After incubation, keep the media by transferring it to a new 96-well plate or chamber slide. Wash cells with PBS.Create wounds with a tip for chamber slides and a scratcher for 96-well plates in cells immersed in PBS. A horizontal wound is created in the middle of the well for 96-well plates. To create wounding for chamber slides, draw a cross to create two wounds in each well.After wounding, put back media onto the cells.Incubate cells at 37 °C for another 2 h. During this period, cells migrate towards the wound, as shown in Video 1. The video demonstrates SAS cells wound-healing migration for 10 h. The purpose of the 2 h migration is to ensure that the cells migrate towards the wound to form nascent FAs (Olson and Nechiporuk, 2021). The lamellipodia of migrating cells towards the wound are stretched out. Nascent FAs are visible under this condition.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1.",
    "Wound-healing migration of SAS cells for 10 h Immunofluorescence fixation and staining Fix cells with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 15 min.Permeate cells with 0.25% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 10 min.Block cells with 5% BSA at room temperature for 1 h.Incubate cells with primary antibodies in 1% BSA in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Anti-PXN is used as primary antibody to stain FA.Stain cells with secondary antibodies and 10 μg/mL of DAPI (10 μg/mL) in 1% BSA in PBS.Use a Nikon Eclipse Ti for FA imaging. Focus on the FAs of the fixed cells and take z-stack images. Take images of FA with a step size of 1 μm.
