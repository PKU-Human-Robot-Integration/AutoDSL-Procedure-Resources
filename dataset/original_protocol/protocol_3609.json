Recombinant scFv often forms inclusion bodies in E. coli cells due to the reducing environment in the bacterial cytoplasm. We have tested scFv expression in NEB SHuffle T7 Competent E. coli cells that provide an oxidative environment, however scFv expression still results in inclusion body formation. Here we describe the refolding and purification of scFv from the inclusion body (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]), with modifications of the previous protocol (Pastan and Ho, 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) .\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/534-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Diagram of the workflow for refolding and purification of scFv from the inclusion body\nPreparation of scFv from the inclusion body\nTransform 1 μl pETHis6TEV-scFv plasmid into 20 μl BL21(DE3) RIPL cells following the manufacturer’s protocol. Spread ∼20 μL transformed cells onto an LB agar plate containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 18 h.\nInoculate a single colony into 10 mL LB medium containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin and grow in a 37°C incubator shaker at 220 rpm for 14 h.\nDilute the 10 mL LB cell culture into 1 L of 2x YT medium containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin. Continue to grow until the OD600 of the cell culture reaches 0.8.\nCool the cell culture and the incubator shaker to 25°C. Induce protein expression by adding 0.5 mM IPTG and continue to grow the cells in the 25°C incubator shaker at 220 rpm for 16 h.\nHarvest the cells by centrifugation at 3000xg, 10 min at 4°C in a Beckman Coulter Avanti J-20I centrifuge. Resuspend the cells in 35 mL Lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). Add 0.5 mL 50 mg/mL lysozyme stock solution and freeze the cells on dry ice.",
    "Thaw the cells in a 42°C water bath. The cell lysate should be very sticky. Break up the sticky cell lysate using a Misonix sonicator for 4 min (15 s ON, 1 min OFF with 15% power level), keeping the sample on ice.\nPellet the inclusion body by centrifugation at 27,000xg for 20 min at 4°C in a Beckman Coulter Avanti J-20I centrifuge.\nDiscard the supernatant, resuspend the pellet in wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100). If the pellet is still sticky, break it up with sonication for 30 s. Collect the inclusion body pellets by centrifugation. Decant the supernatant.\nWash the pellet two more time using lysis buffer and collect the inclusion body pellets as above.\nPause Point: The scFv inclusion body pellet can be stored at −80°C up to a month at this step.\nOptional: Inclusion bodies can be prepared from the bacterial cells using a commercially available reagent such as B-per Bacterial Protein Extraction Reagent (Pierce; Thermo Scientific Life Science, Rockford, IL, USA). Add 2.5 mL (official document states 4 mL) of the reagent containing 500 ug of lysozyme (10 μL of 50 mg/mL stock) and 20 U of DNase I (8 μL of 2500 U/mL (∼1 mg/mL) stock) per 1 g of wet cells to the bacterial cell pellet. After gentle shaking for 10 min, collect the pellets by centrifugation at 14,500xg for 20 min, and then suspend in 15 mL of B-per Reagent diluted 10 fold. After gentle shaking for 10 min, collect the inclusion body pellets by centrifugation at 14,500xg for 20 min.\nRefolding of scFv from inclusion body",
    "Dissolve the inclusion body pellet with 10 mL denaturation buffer (100 mM Tris-HCI, pH8, 6 M Guanidine buffer, 2 mM EDTA). Add 1,4-dithioerythritol (DTE) powder to a final concentration of 10 mg/mL. Break up the pellet briefly using a ceramic rod and shake with a BenchWaver 3D Rocker at 66 rpm for 16 h.\nClear the solution by centrifugation at 130,000xg, 10°C for 1 h in a Beckman Coulter ultracentrifuge.\nAdd oxidized glutathione powder fresh to the 10°C chilled scFv refolding buffer (100 mM Tris–HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 M arginine, pH 9.5) to a final concentration of 551 mg/L. Stir the buffer with a magnetic stirring bar at 600 rpm. Quickly add 10 mL of the supernatant from step 11 to 1 L of refolding buffer in a glass beaker and continue stirring the buffer for 2–3 min.\nCover the beaker with aluminum foil. Incubate the refolding solution in a 10°C refrigerator for ∼48 h without stirring.\nPrepare 2 x 4.5 L dialysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.4) and chill to 4°C.\nAdd 30.6 g urea powder to the dialysis buffer, dialyze 1 L of refolding solution against 4.5 L dialysis buffer using 6 - 8 kDa cut-off dialysis tubing for 16 h.\nReplace with fresh dialysis buffer, add 30.6 g urea powder and again perform dialysis for 16 h.\nPurification of scFv\nCollect all of the refolding solution in a 2 L beaker, adjust the pH to around 7.8 (add ∼2.6 mL 35% HCl) at 4°C and remove any aggregates by centrifugation at 4000xg, 4°C for 10 min. Filter the supernatant through a 0.22 μm filter unit.",
    "Equilibrate 4 mL SP Sepharose Fast Flow resin with 20 mL of SP binding buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4), 20 mL volumes of SP binding buffer with 1 M NaCl and then 20 mL volumes of SP binding buffer again. Add the resin directly into the scFv refolding solution, stirring the solution using a magnetic stir bar at 150 rpm. Let scFv bind to the SP resin for 1 h at 4°C.\nPass the solution through an Econo column, save the flow through temporarily. Wash the resin in the column with a total of 150 mL SP binding buffer (10 mL, 15 times), then wash the resin twice using binding buffer containing 100 mM NaCl. Elute the scFv with 48 mL SP elute buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 8 mL each, 6 times). Check the OD280 of each elution fraction (the OD280 for the second elution fraction should be around 0.3 - 0.6). Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]\nAnalyze each fraction and the flow through on an SDS PAGE gel. The flow through can be discarded if there is no more scFv in it. The protein yield after SP chromatography is ∼10 - 15 mg.\nEquilibrate a 5-mL Histrap column with 5 column volumes of Histrap wash buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 40 mM Imidazole, 300 mM NaCl), 5 column volumes of Histrap elution buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mM Imidazole, 300 mM NaCl) and then 5 column volumes of Histrap wash buffer again.",
    "Combine all fractions from step 19 that contain scFv, add 1/10 v/v of Histrap elution buffer to the sample (final imidazole concentration should be around 44 mM). Inject the sample into a 5 mL pre-equilibrated Histrap column, wash with 5 volumes of Histrap wash buffer. Elute by linearly increasing the imidazole concentration from 40 mM to 250 mM over 20 column volumes using an AKTA FPLC.\nCollect fractions from the main elution peak (appears around 80 mL). Check each fraction on an SDS PAGE gel (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], lanes 3–9). The protein yield after Histrap chromatography is ∼5 - 10 mg Combine the fractions containing scFv and concentrate them to around 4 mL.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/534-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. SDS PAGE analysis of scFv purification using Histrap HP and Superdex S75 column\nM: Thermo Scientific PageRuler Prestained Protein Ladder, 10 to 180 kDa; lane 1: samples injected into Histrap column; lane 2: flow through of Histrap column; lane 3–9: elution peak fractions from Histrap column; lane 10–13: peak fraction from Superdex S75 size exclusion column.\nCritical: Do not over concentrate the scFv as it will aggregate at concentration above 5 mg/mL.\nEquilibrate the Superdex S75 10/600 column with Gel-Filtration buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) for 2 column volumes.\nInject 2 mL of the scFv sample from step 23 to the Superdex S75 10/600 column with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The scFv with correct disulfide bonds appears at around 65 mL. Check each fraction on an SDS PAGE gel (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], lanes 10–13). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]",
    "Concentrate the peak fractions to ∼1.5 mL volume using a 10 kDa cut-off Amicon concentration device. Keep the concentration to around 5 uM, as a higher concentration can lead to aggregation and loss of scFv. The protein yield after S75 chromatography is ∼3 - 5 mg. Store scFv in a 4°C refrigerator. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]\nPreparation of the scFv stabilized chromatosome for cryo-EM study\nTiming: [2 - 3 days]\nTo prepare the scFv stabilized chromatosome, we first do small volume titration of 197 bp nucleosome with linker histone in the presence of chaperone ProTα and analyze each titration on a native PAGE gel. After the best ratio is determined, we then do large scale preparation of chromatosomes, and add scFv to the chromatosome sample before preparation of the cryo-EM grids.\nPreparation of chromatosome\nDissolve ∼ 5 mg H1 and ProTα protein powder in 0.5 mL nuclease-free water by rocking for 30 min, then mix with 0.5 mL gel filtration buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA and 600 mM NaCl).\nRemove any aggregates by centrifugation at 27,000xg, 4°C for 15 min. Inject the supernatant onto a Superdex S75 10/300GL Increase column that has been pre-equilibrated in gel filtration buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA and 600 mM NaCl). Run at 0.75 mL/min using an AKTA FPLC, collect the peak fractions and measure the concentration of each protein.\nCast a 4.8 % native PAGE gel (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]). Pre-run the gel in 0.2x TBE at 120V, 4°C for 2 h.",
    "Dilute nucleosome, ProTα, and H1 with TEN10 buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaCl and 0.5 mM TCEP) to a concentration of 1, 2, and 1 uM, respectively. Titrate 100 nM nucleosome with 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, or 200 nM of H1 in the presence of 200 nM ProTα and 2% Ficoll 400. Adjust the final volume of the binding reaction to 10 μL and incubate at 25°C for 15 min.\nLoad 5 μL of each reaction on a 4.8% native PAGE gel, run in 0.2x TBE buffer at 100 V for 120 min at 4°C.\nStain the gel with Midori Green Advance stain, visualize the gel using a ChemiDoc gel imaging system (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/534-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Titration of 100 nM nucleosome with various concentration of H1 resolved in a 4.8% native PAGE gel\nDetermine the best ratio for the nucleosome and H1. Use that ratio to make a large volume (>100 μL) of chromatosome by titration of the nucleosome with H1, in the presence of ProTα. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]\nCritical: Mixing H1 and nucleosome at a high concentration (>100 uM) can cause aggregation. To prevent sample loss, dilute both the nucleosome and H1 to a concentration below 10 uM before titration or mixing.\nPreparation of scFv stabilized chromatosomes\nDilute scFv with TEN10 buffer to a concentration of around 0.5 uM, add 3x molar ratio of scFv to the chromatosome sample and incubate on ice for 15 min.\nTo remove extra scFv and ProTα, concentrate the complex to around 500 μL and inject onto a Superose 6 10/300GL column pre-equilibrated with TEN10 buffer. Run at 0.5 mL/min using an AKTA FPLC. Collect the peak fraction and concentrate to ∼100 μL using an Amicon Ultra 30K MWCO centrifugal filter unit.",
    "Vitrification of scFv stabilized chromatosome and screen grids using cryo-TEM\nMeasure the concentration of the scFv-bound chromatosome. Adjust the concentration to 4–5 uM with TEN10 buffer for sample vitrification.\nPrepare liquid nitrogen cooled ethane and set the operation parameters of the Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to 4°C, 100% humidity, 3 s blotting time.\nPretreat Quantifoil 1.2/1.3 holy carbon copper grids at 15 mA for 60 s using an easiGlow Glow Discharge Cleaning System.\nApply 3 μL of the chromatosome sample to the grid, blot and vitrify the grid using the Vitrobot. Transfer and store the grid in a liquid nitrogen tank.\nFor the latest generation of electron microscope with an autoloading system, assemble the grid with a clip ring and a C-shape spring in the “auto-grid” cartridge system.\nInsert the grid into the electron microscope by the autoloader, screen the grids using SerialEM (Mastronarde, 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]\nOptional: For a traditional electron microscope with side-entry, chill the workstation with liquid nitrogen, carefully transfer the grid to the tip the cryo-holder and secure the grid with the clip ring. With the grid covered by the shutter, promptly insert the holder into the microscope from the side-entry. The grid is then ready for screening."
