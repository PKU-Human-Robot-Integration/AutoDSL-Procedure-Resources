    "The following protocol is performed in adherence to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Yale University Human Research Ethics Committee guidelines.\n1. Sourcing Human Donor Eyes\nObtain human donor globes from the National Disease Research Interchange (NDRI, Philadelphia, PA). Depending on the project, prepare no less than three pairs of donor eyes for each experimental group.\nEnucleate donor eyes within 10 h and ship within 48 h post mortem. Then transport the eyes to the laboratory in sterile Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) culture medium on ice. Previously reported studies have demonstrated that donor eyes harvested and transported in this fashion preserve the biological features and activities of Bruch's membrane25,26,29.\n2. Harvesting of Human Bruch's Membrane Explants\nPlace each eye on a 1.5 x 1.5 inch gauze soaked with carbon dioxide-independent DMEM media in a 100 mm culture dish, and use fine blade scissors to make an incision through the sclera 3 mm posterior to the limbus and circumferentially extending in either direction.\nMake a full-thickness circumferential incision (penetrating to vitreous) 1 mm posterior to the ora serrata. Remove and discard the anterior segment (cornea, lens, and iris), the vitreous and retina.\nUse fine surgical scissors to make four radial incisions in between the sclera and choroid, and then peel the sclera away from the periphery to the optic nerve, while taking care to avoid tearing the choroid/Bruch's membrane complex.\nNext, make a circumferential incision through the suprachoroidal space along the ora serrata and peel the RPE-Bruch’s membrane-choroid complex posteriorly from the sclera.\nRemove native RPE cells by bathing the explant with 0.02 M ammonium hydroxide in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) in a 60 x 15 mm polystyrene Petri dish for 20 min at room temperature, followed by washing it three-times in DPBS (Figure 1).",
    "Float the Bruch's membrane complex explant in carbon dioxide-free media over an unlaminated, hydrophobic 65 µm-thick polytetrafluoroethylene membrane with 0.2 µm pores, with the basal lamina layer of each explant facing the membrane.\nPlace a polytetrafluoroethylene membrane with Bruch's membrane explant on a fritted glass support in a glass microanalysis vacuum filter-holder system.\nFlatten the curled edges from the choroidal side with fine forceps coated with Teflon, taking care not to touch the Bruch's membrane basal laminin side.\nHeat 15 mL of agarose (4% in DPBS) and then cool it to 37 °C. Then pour 15 mL of the liquidized gel onto the Bruch's membrane-choroid complex from the choroidal-side while applying gentle suction to guarantee that the explant will remain flat. Keep the tissue at 4 °C for 2 - 3 min to solidify the agarose and then peel the polytetrafluoroethylene membrane away.\nPlace the Bruch's membrane explant (1.5 inches in diameter, within solidified agarose gel) in a 60 x 15 mm polystyrene cell culture dish (with Bruch's membrane facing up) that has been lined with warm liquid agarose on the bottom of the dish to fix the Bruch's membrane explant on the bottom of the well with the explant basal laminin layer facing up.\nThe agarose will solidify within 2 - 3 min at room temperature to stabilize the Bruch's membrane explants in the culture dish. Cover the Bruch's membrane explants in the culture dish with DPBS and store the dish at 4 °C for future use. Figure 2A demonstrates the isolated Bruch's membrane explants in a 60 x 15 mm culture dish.\nIf the desired culture system is in a 96-well plate, place the Bruch's membrane explant (1.5 inches in diameter, with solidified agarose gel) on a flat Teflon sheet with the laminin-side up.",
    "Using a trephine, cut five or six, 6 mm-circular buttons from the Bruch's membrane complex explant and place each on 4% agarose at 37 °C in a non-treated polystyrene well of a 96-well plate. The agarose will solidify within 2-3 min at room temperature to fix the Bruch's membrane explants (buttons) on the bottom of each well.\n\tNOTE: Figure 2B demonstrates trephined Bruch's membrane buttons in a 96-well plate. Typically, 9 - 11 buttons or explants can be harvested from each eye.\n3. Culturing of Retinal Pigment Epithelial (RPE) Cells on Human Bruch's Membrane Explants\nUpon receipt of the donor eyes, clean the extraocular tissue with DPBS. Make a circumferential incision 5 mm below the iris-sclera touch point (pars plana) into the subretinal space. Discard the anterior segment, vitreous humor, and retina.\nWash the eyecup, which contains the Bruch's membrane and RPE sheet, with cold DPBS. Dissociate the RPE cells with 5 mL of 0.25% trypsin for no longer than 10 min for each eye sample. Quench the trypsin reaction with 25 mL of DMEM complete medium with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) warmed at 37 °C in a 50 mL tube.\nCentrifuge the cells at 200 × g for 10 min at 24 °C, and resuspend the pellet in 5 mL of DMEM complete medium (with 15% FBS).\nCount the cells and seed 15,000 viable RPE cells onto the basal lamina of each various aged Bruch's membrane explants (buttons) in a 96-well plate in 200 µL of serum-free minimum essential media (MEM) containing antibiotics (100 IU/mL penicillin G, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, 5 mg/mL gentamicin, and 2.5 mg/mL amphotericin B). Assuming a cell diameter of 20 µm, plating at this density will allow RPE cells to cover approximately 15% of the plating area.",
    "Plate the cells onto the button, whereby the cell density can then be increased stepwise up to 100% confluence depending on the effect of each parameter on cell behavior.\nAllow the cells to attach to the explant for 24 h in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air/5% CO2 at 37 °C. Gently change medium with warm complete DMEM."
