    "Retina Injury (Kaur et al., 2018; Mitra et al., 2018; Mitra et al., 2019; Sharma et al., 2019)Prepare 50 ml of 1x tricaine methane sulfonate solution in the fish water.Anesthetize the fish by putting in tricaine solution till the gill’s movement slows down.Keep the anesthetized fish on a wet paper towel bedding with the right side facing upward.Focus the zebrafish eye under a stereomicroscope and tilt the dorsal side of eyeball gently with forceps.Poke one edge of the ventral side of the eye with 30 G needle by stab wound injury and then injure the other edge of the eye.Repeat the injuries on the dorsal side of the eye by tilting it gently from the ventral side so that a total of four injuries are made.Let the fish revive in the system water (see Video 1 for details).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Retinal injury in zebrafish In vivo mRNA transfection (Mitra et al., 2018; Sharma et al., 2019)In vivo overexpression of genes is achieved by mRNA transfection in the retina. It involves the following steps (see Video 2 for details):<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Intravitreal injection and morpholino electroporation Preparation of transfection reagentClone GFP or gene of interest into pCS2+ plasmid. Linearize the vector containing insert from the 3’ end. Prepare mRNA with a sp6 message machine in vitro transcription kit. Precipitate mRNA and dissolve in nuclease-free water to make a stock of 2,000 ng/µl.Prepare transfection mixture (8 µl) with lipofectamine 2,000 transfection reagent as follows:Mix 2 µl each of mRNA (2,000 ng/µl) and 2x HBSS solution at room temperature.Mix 2 µl of lipofectamine with an equal volume of 2x HBSS solution at a ratio of 1:1 and keep the solution at room temperature.Let both the solutions stand at room temperature for five minutes.",
    "Mix the solutions (i) and (ii), dropwise at a ratio of 1:1 and keep the mixture the room temperature for 30 min. Use the final transfection mixture containing 500 ng/µl of mRNA for intravitreal injection.Note: This transfection mixture is for intravitreal injections in 4-5 zebrafish and only a single concentration of mRNA has been used. Depending upon the experimental need, these volumes can be scaled up or down, without any loss in transfection efficiency. In vivo overexpression by intravitreal injectionAnesthetize the fish and injure the right eye by making four stab wounds with a 30 G needle.From the fourth poke inject 1 µl of transfection mixture using Hamilton syringe.Electroporate the fish by placing a negative electrode on the right eye and positive electrode on the other side.Electroporate with five pulses at 70 V of 50 milliseconds duration with a gap period of 950 milliseconds between the pulses.Harvest the eyes on 4 days post-injury as described in sections E and F.In gene overexpression retina check the proliferation in terms of BrdU positive cells in comparison to GFP transfected retinae (see Procedures E, F and G).Check the transfection by immunostaining for GFP and subsequent imaging which shows GFP in the whole retina. Two representative images to show GFP expression at the injury site and away from the injury site are appended here for reference (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191217/20191217015426_0190.jpgFigure 1.

ONL−outer nuclear layer; OPL−outer plexiform layer; INL−inner nuclear layer; IPL−inner plexiform layer; GCL−ganglion cell layer.Drug delivery and Morpholino electroporation (Kaur et al., 2018; Mitra et al., 2018; Mitra et al., 2019; Sharma et al., 2019)To study the localized effect of drugs, proteins, and gene knockdown approaches, intravitreal injections are made.",
    "Preparation of solution for injection:Dissolve the lyophilized morpholino (300 ng) in 300 µl of autoclaved Milli-Q water to make a stock of 1 mM. Use neat for 1 mM or dilute with Milli-Q water to make stocks of 0.5 or 0.25 mM for injection.Dissolve the protein in the recommended solvent to make a stock solution and dilute further in 1x PBS or recommended diluent.Dissolve the drugs in 1 ml DMSO (Dimethyl sulfoxide) or recommended solvent to make a stock solution of final concentration depending upon the molecular mass and weight of the pharmacological inhibitor. Make the required working concentrations from the main stock by diluting with Milli-Q water.Injection of the solution:Injure one retina by stab wound injury as described above.From the fourth poke inject around 1 µl of the reagent with Hamilton syringe.In the case of morpholino delivery, electroporate the morpholino to make their entry in the retina.Place the positive electrode on the eye injected with morpholino and the negative electrode on the other eye.Electroporate at the conditions given above.Harvest the eyes on 4 days post retinal injury (dpi) as described below.BrdU labelingBrdU pulse labeling is done for 3 h before harvesting the eye on 4 dpi. It labels actively proliferating cells by incorporating thymidine analog (BrdU) in the replicating DNA.Make 5 mM solution of BrdU by dissolving 15.35 mg of BrdU powder in 10ml of autoclaved Milli-Q water. Make 1 ml aliquots and store at -20 °C for later use.Bring the BrdU solution at room temperature before use and fill in the insulin syringe.Anesthetize the fish and hold on a wet paper towel under the microscope.Insert the insulin needle gently in the midway between pelvic fins and making needle parallel to the fish body taking care not to damage internal organs.",
    "Inject around one unit (15-20 µl) of BrdU solution and leave the fish for 3 h in the system water.Harvesting and tissue preparationHarvesting of eye (see Video 3 for details)Euthanize the fish by tricaine overdosing (prolonged immersion in 1x tricaine solution).Gently pull out the eye out of the socket with forceps.Keep the eye in chilled fixative in the Petri plate and focus under a stereomicroscope.Hold the eye with forceps and pierce the cornea with a needle. With the help of forceps tear the cornea and gently push the eye allowing the lens come out.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 3. Zebrafish euthanasia and harvesting of the eye Tissue fixationFix the eye overnight at 4 °C in 4% PFA with continuous rotation at 12 rpm on rotor spin.Remove the PFA and dehydrate the tissue in the sucrose gradient for 45 min each at room temperature with continuous rotation. Add the sucrose solutions as follows:5% sucrose, 1 volume5%:20% sucrose, 2:1 volume5%:20% sucrose, 1:1 volume5%:20% sucrose, 1:2 volume20% sucrose, 1 volumeFinally, replace 20% sucrose with 500 µl of fresh sucrose solution and add an equal volume of OCT into it. Mix by rotation at room temperature for 30 min.Make cubic molds of aluminum foil by wrapping on cubits.Fill the mold till half with OCT, put a labeled flag at the top and place the eye dorsoventrally parallel to it.Freeze the positioned eye immediately by keeping at -80 °C.Cryo-sectioning and ImmunostainingCryo-sectioningTurn on the cryostat and keep eye blocks inside the chamber for 10 min.Fix the tissue on specimen disc with the help of OCT.Fix the specimen disc on the specimen head and label the glass slides.Remove the excess of OCT till retinal tissue starts appearing.Take 8-10 µm thin serial sections on glass slides.Allow the slides dry overnight at room temperature.",
    "ImmunostainingTake one set of slides and lay them horizontally on the immunostaining rack.Give three washes with 1x PBS for 10 min each to remove OCT.Block the tissues with 5% BSA in PBST (1x PBS with 0.01% Triton X-100) for 2-3 h at room temperature.Remove the blocking solution and overlay the slides with the primary antibody at 4 °C overnight.Next day collect the primary antibody and wash the slides three times with PBST at room temperature for 10 min each.Overlay the slides with fluorescently labeled secondary antibody for 2-3 h at room temperature.Collect the secondary antibody and wash the slides thrice with PBST.Stop the reaction by washing with autoclaved water.Let the slides dry vertically in the dark for 10-15 min.Mount the slides with 60 µl DABCO and coverslip them.Let the slides dry overnight at room temperature in a dark chamber.Image acquisitionExamine the slides under a fluorescence microscope and take images with a confocal imaging system with a Nikon Ni-E fluorescence microscope equipped with fluorescence optics and Nikon A1 confocal imaging system."
