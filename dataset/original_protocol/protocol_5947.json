    "LaurdanAccording to most manufacturers, undissolved laurdan is stable for years if kept at -20 °C and protected from light. However, our experience is that its spectral properties might change much earlier depending on the individual batch. Since this significantly affects the reproducibility of results, we recommend checking the emission wavelength spectrum of the dye when excited at 350 nm. To this end, an emission wavelength scan of laurdan-stained liposomes (see protocol below) should be performed. A typical laurdan spectrum should show a clear peak at 440 nm and a second peak or shoulder at 480-500 nm (Figure 2) Deteriorated laurdan batches display two peaks at ~420 and ~460 nm with a clear drop at 440 nm (Figure 2), which drastically affects the GP measurements. Due to this problem, we recommend the following handling of the laurdan dye. A 10 mM Laurdan stock solution is prepared in DMF. Stock solutions can usually be kept at -20 °C for up to 3 months. In case of visible precipitation or formation of a micelle film on the surface, a new stock needs to be prepared. Every new 10 mM stock should be checked in an emission scan prior to first use. A 1 mM working solution is prepared from this stock by dilution in DMF. This ensures a final DMF concentration of 1%, which helps keeping laurdan soluble in the medium or buffer and increases reproducibility of the results. Aliquoted working solutions are stable for 4-6 weeks at -20 °C. Multiple freeze-thaw cycles should be avoided and laurdan solutions must be protected from light at all times. For optimal reproducibility, all experiments of one series should be performed with the same stock.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181017/20181017010424_1522.jpgFigure 2. Deterioration of laurdan over time. Emission wavelength scans of laurdan incorporated into 0.2 µm liposomes made from E.",
    "coli polar lipid extract were recorded with an excitation wavelength of 350 nm. Liposomes were stained as described in Step A1b. Measurements were taken in 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 at constant 30 °C. Note the change of the 440 nm peak into two peaks at 420 and 460 nm. Laurdan was kept undissolved at -20 °C and was protected from light constantly.Laurdan SpectroscopySpectroscopic membrane fluidity measurements with laurdan are straight-forward and easy to implement. Optimal results are obtained with a plate reader equipped with monochromators, but appropriate filter sets covering 350 nm excitation and 440 and 500 nm emission wavelengths are also suitable. The protocol can also be adapted for the use in fluorimeters, yet they do not offer the high throughput of the 96-well plate format (Note 1). A constant temperature is pivotal for membrane fluidity measurements and the plate reader must be equipped with a precision temperature control. Ideally, sample preparation is carried out in a climate room to ensure stable temperature. If this is not possible, samples must be handled quickly and all solutions and plastic ware must be pre-warmed. Pipetting steps are carried out in a thermomixer. If samples must be transported to another location, they must be kept warm at all times. Multistep or multichannel pipettes are recommended when preparing several samples to save sample handling time. In case of B. subtilis, which is extremely sensitive to oxygen depletion, cells also must be kept shaking at all times. In order to prevent membrane damage by shearing forces, pipetting of cells should be kept to a minimum and cell pellets should never be resuspended by pipetting up and down.",
    "Laurdan Spectroscopy of bacteria (Note 2)Set up overnight cultures in lysogeny broth (LB) or other medium of choice and grow overnight at the desired temperature (typically 30 or 37 °C; we used 30 °C for all experiments in this paper) (Notes 3 and 4).Dilute overnight cultures 1:100 in fresh LB or another medium of choice (Notes 3 and 4).Grow at the desired temperature until the desired cell density (standard: 30 or 37 °C, log phase) (Note 5).Add 10 µM laurdan from 1 mM working solution and incubate for 10 min.Harvest cells by centrifugation using pre-warmed (30 °C) 2 ml microtubes in a pre-warmed microtube centrifuge (up to 16,000 x g, 30 s, 30 °C). (Note 6)Wash 4x in pre-warmed (30 °C) laurdan buffer (Note 7). Keep tubes warm using a thermomixer while pipetting. Resuspend cells by vortexing shortly rather than pipetting up and down to avoid shearing forces that could damage the membrane.For end point measurements (Figure 3A)Resuspend cells to a final OD600 of 0.4.Add 200 µl (Note 8) of cell suspension per well to a pre-warmed (30 °C) black flat and clear bottom microtiter plate using a fluorescence plate reader. Depending on the number of samples, this step should be facilitated by using a multistep pipette (Note 9).Measure fluorescence in a suitable plate reader (excitation: 350 nm, emission: 460 and 500 nm).For end point measurements with antibiotics (Note 10) (Figures 3B and 3D)Resuspend cells to a final OD600 of 0.4Add 220 µl of cells to 2 ml pre-warmed (30 °C) micro tubes and add appropriate antibiotic concentrations.Incubate in a thermomixer at constant temperature and shaking for the desired time. Typically, 5-10 min of treatment are sufficient for most antibiotics. Treatment with 30-50 mM of the membrane fluidizer benzyl alcohol serves as positive control.",
    "As additional controls measure (i) the supernatants of the washing steps (to determine the efficiency of washing) and (ii) laurdan buffer (to subtract the background). The fluorescence intensity of stained cells should be at least 10 times higher than the fluorescence intensity of the laurdan buffer background control. Add 200 µl of the incubated cell suspension per well to a pre-warmed (30 °C) black flat and clear bottom microtiter plate (Note 10).Measure fluorescence in a fluorescence plate reader (excitation: 350 nm, emission: 460 and 500 nm).For kinetic measurements with antibiotics (Note 9) (Figures 3C and 4)Resuspend cells to a final OD600 of 0.8.Add 100 µl of stained cell suspension to 100 µl of pre-warmed (30 °C) laurdan washing buffer (control samples) in a pre-warmed (30 °C) black flat and clear bottom microtiter plate (Notes 6 and 8).Measure fluorescence in a fluorescence plate reader in 2 min intervals over 6-10 min to record the pre-treatment baseline (Note 11).Add 100 µl of stained cell suspension to 100 µl of pre-warmed (30 °C) laurdan washing buffer containing twice the desired antibiotic concentration in a pre-warmed (30 °C) black flat and clear bottom microtiter plate. If necessary, use a multistep pipette to reduce sample handling time.Immediately measure fluorescence in 2 min intervals over 30 min (Notes 12 and 13).If done correctly, laurdan GP measurements of untreated cells are very reproducible, even with different batches of growth medium (Figure 4). Antibiotic-treated samples might show a bit more variation but are usually very well reproducible as well (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181017/20181017010444_3564.jpgFigure 3. Spectroscopic Laurdan measurements in living bacteria. A. One point measurements of B. subtilis 168 (Anagnostopoulos and Spizizen, 1961) grown under different conditions. SMM (Spizizen minimal medium) and BMM (Belitzky minimal medium) are minimal media commonly used for B. subtilis (Anagnostopoulos and Spizizen, 1961; Stülke et al.",
    ", 1993; Wenzel et al., 2011). Note that different media have a far more drastic effect on membrane fluidity than moderate differences in temperature and growth phase. Early log phase refers to an OD600 of 0.3. Late log phase refers to an OD600 of 0.8. B. One point Laurdan measurements of B. subtilis 168 treated with antibiotics for 10 min (growth temperature 30 °C). Minimal inhibitory concentrations were used. C. Kinetic Laurdan measurements of B. subtilis 168 treated with the same antibiotics under the same conditions as in (B). Note the gradual effect of the antimicrobial hexapeptide MP196 compared to the immediate effect of the cyclic β-sheet peptide gramicidin S and the membrane fluidizer benzyl alcohol. D. One point Laurdan measurements of S. aureus NCTC 8325 (Bæk et al., 2013). S. aureus was grown in LB at 37 °C. Measurements were taken at an OD600 of 0.3. Note the different membrane fluidity that S. aureus and B. subtilis display under the same growth conditions.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181017/20181017010459_8234.jpgFigure 4. Reproducibility of laurdan measurements using B. subtilis. B. subtilis 168 was grown in LB at 30 °C under continuous shaking. Three independent biological replicates from three different days are shown. Laurdan stocks, buffers, and media were separately prepared for each replicate. Error bars show the standard deviation of 5 technical replicates. Untreated samples are highly reproducible, while antibiotic-treated samples show a slight variation.Laurdan spectroscopy of liposomesPrepare liposomes from the desired lipids with your method and buffer of choice. Here we used 10 mg/ml 0.4 µm liposomes prepared from E. coli polar lipid extract in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, using the detergent-dialysis method described in Strahl and Hamoen (2010).Dilute liposome stock with double-distilled water to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml liposomes and 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4.",
    "Add 10 µM laurdan from 1 mM working stock solution in DMF and incubate at 30 °C for 30 min. Keep the temperature stable at all times (here 30 °C).For one point measurements with antibiotics (Figure 5A)Add 20 µl of stained liposomes to 180 µl 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with and without antibiotic compound in a black flat and clear bottom microtiter plate (pre-warmed to 30 °C) and incubate for the desired time period (2-10 min are typically sufficient) (Note 13).Measure samples in a microtiter plate reader.For kinetic measurements with antibiotics (Figure 5B)Add 20 µl of stained liposomes to 180 µl pre-warmed (30 °C) 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (control samples) in a black flat and clear bottom microtiter plate (Note 13).Measure fluorescence in 2 min intervals over 6-10 min to record the pre-treatment baseline.Add 20 µl of stained liposomes to 180 µl pre-warmed (30 °C) 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 containing antibiotic compound (final concentrations calculated for 200 µl final volume) in a black flat and clear bottom microtiter plate.Measure samples for 30 min in 2 min intervals (Note 14).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181017/20181017010517_8105.jpgFigure 5. Laurdan measurements of liposomes composed of E. coli polar lipid extracts. A. One point Laurdan measurements with different concentrations of antibiotic. Liposomes were kept at constant 30 °C. Note the concentration-dependent rigidification/fluidization effect. Since lipid to compound ratios in vivo cannot be exactly determined due to unknown biological factors such as binding to cell wall components, they cannot be compared to in vitro lipid to compound ratios using artificial liposomes. We therefore recommend testing a range of concentrations to control, e.g., total membrane lysis at too high concentrations. B. Kinetic Laurdan measurements under the same conditions used in (A).",
    "Note the gradual effect of the antimicrobial hexapeptide MP196 compared to the immediate effect of the cyclic β-sheet peptide gramicidin S and the membrane fluidizer benzyl alcohol, which corresponds very well to the in vivo measurements (Figure 3C).Laurdan microscopyLaurdan microcopy requires a fluorescence light microscope with a high quality 100x oil immersion objective with correction for chromatic aberration (see Step A2a), a temperature chamber, and a specific set of filters. 350 nm excitation and 440 nm emission are usually covered by standard DAPI filter sets. For the second emission wavelength a special filter set with the exact same excitation filter and dichroic mirror as the DAPI set, but an emission filter that covers 500-540 nm, is necessary (see filters described in the Equipment section). Since temperature-dependent changes in membrane fluidity happen rapidly, a temperature-controlled chamber is of key importance for reliable and reproducible results.Microscope calibrationFor laurdan microscopy, a separate picture is taken for each emission wavelength. For correct GP calculation a perfect overlay of these pictures is essential. Therefore, it is necessary to determine wavelength-dependent differences in magnification and z-offset prior to laurdan microscopy experiments. These aberrations depend on the objective type and can be greatly reduced using a high-quality objective with a high degree of chromatic aberration correction, such as the Nikon APO or Zeiss APOCHROMAT series. In our laurdan setup using a Nikon CFI Plan Apochromat objective (see Equipment section for details on the objective and filters), chromatic aberration is neglectable. Calibration only needs to be done once the objective or filters are changed.Prepare a microscope slide covered with a 1.2% agarose film (Note 15) and spot an appropriate dilution of multicolor fluorescent beads (e.g., TetraSpeck).Select a field of view with beads located close the edges of the field.",
    "Perform a z-stack (200 nm step size, 5 µm depth) with both wavelengths.Select the exact focal plane for each individual wavelength by examining the captured z-stacks. Here the optimal focus is determined by measuring the point spread function (PSF) of a chosen fluorescent bead. The focal plane with the optimal focus is characterized by the narrowest PSF. This step can be carried out in ImageJ by determining the fluorescence intensity with line scan profile measured across the bead. If the optimal focal plane differs between the wavelengths used, correct this error by introducing a corresponding wavelength-dependent z-offset in the image acquisition routine of your microscope software.Select two beads at opposite edges of the field of view and measure the distance between the centers of the fluorescent beads for each wavelength. Depending on the objective, the distance (measured in pixels or in µm) will be slightly larger for the 440 nm emission wavelength picture. Use this value to later adjust the size of the 520 nm emission wavelength pictures during data analysis in ImageJ. Laurdan microscopy (Note 2) (Figure 6)Set up an overnight culture in lysogeny broth (LB) or other medium of choice and grow overnight at the desired temperature (typically 30 or 37 °C) (Notes 3 and 4).Dilute overnight cultures 1:100 in fresh LB or other medium of choice (Notes 3 and 4).Grow at the desired temperature until the desired cell density (standard: 30 or 37 °C, log phase) (Note 5).Add 10 µM laurdan from 1 mM working solution and incubate for 10 min (Note 16).Harvest cells by centrifugation using pre-warmed (30 °C) 2 ml microtubes in a pre-warmed microtube centrifuge (up to 16,000 x g, 30 s, 30 °C).Wash 4x in pre-warmed (30 °C) laurdan buffer (Note 6). Keep tubes warm using a thermomixer while pipetting.",
    "Resuspend cells by vortexing rather than pipetting up and down to avoid shearing forces that could damage the membrane (Note 17).Resuspend in laurdan buffer to an OD600 of 0.4.Prepare 50-200 µl aliquots in pre-warmed (30 °C) 2 ml microtubes and add antibiotics (or apply other condition of interest). Incubation times of 5-10 min are typically sufficient (Note 18).Withdraw 0.5 µl and spot on a glass slide covered with a thin layer of 1.2% agarose (Note 15). Wait until the droplet has just dried up (~60 s) and immediately add a coverslip. Prevent the formation of air bubbles between coverslip and agarose.Search for a good field of view with a sufficient number of cells using phase contrast or bright field. Perfect focus is crucial for laurdan microscopy.Take a picture in the laurdan custom channel followed by a second picture in the DAPI channel (typically 1 s exposure time each) (Notes 19, 20 and 21).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181017/20181017010532_7399.jpgFigure 6. Laurdan microscopy of B. subtilis 168. Separate pictures were taken with 440 nm (A) and 520 nm (B) emission wavelength using two filter cubes with exactly the same excitation filter (360 nm) and dichroic mirror (405 nm). After correction of wavelength-dependent size aberration and z-drift, a GP map can be generated using the ImageJ Calculate GP plugin (C). Since GP values will be calculated for any pixel, it is important to apply an individual background correction for each picture. However, nonsense GP values will still appear in the cytoplasmic space of the cells and for the untrained eye it can be difficult to distinguish the cell membrane from the rest of the cells.",
    "It is therefore helpful to create an overlay of the laurdan GP picture (grey) with one of the fluorescence channel pictures (red) to determine the exact position of the cytoplasmic membrane in the GP picture (D). This also greatly facilitates measuring GP values in an area of interest (e.g., membrane patch or rest membrane) using ImageJ. This figure was adapted from Saeloh et al. (2018).DiIC12DiIC12 microscopy can in principle be carried out with any good fluorescence microscope. It is advised to use a Cy3 filter (here 535 nm excitation and 590 nm emission) for an optimal signal. While detection of DiIC12 with standard RFP filters (around 570 nm excitation and 645 nm emission) is possible, the much lower signal often results in less clear RIFs. While the staining procedure is simple, observation of clear RIFs in B. subtilis critically depends on the growth phase, and stressed cells either display smooth DiIC12 stains or large patches. Therefore, stable culturing conditions are essential, especially with respect to temperature and oxygen supply.  Fluid membrane domain staining with DiIC12 can be easily adapted for other Gram-positive bacteria, e.g., S. aureus and S. pneumoniae (Figure 7). However, RIFs in strict sense are defined fluid foci as observed in B. subtilis and Escherichia coli and seem to be a phenomenon of MreB-dependent longitudinal cell elongation (Strahl et al., 2014; Oswald et al., 2016), and do not occur in bacteria that grow differently (Saeloh et al., 2018) (Figure 7). DiIC12 can be used in Gram-negative bacteria but may result in less intense membrane staining. A successful method for E. coli has been established by Oswald et al. (2016).",
    "DiIC12 microscopy (Figures 7 and 8)Set up overnight cultures in lysogeny broth (LB) or other medium of choice and grow overnight at the desired temperature (typically 30 or 37 °C) (Notes 3 and 4).Dilute overnight cultures 1:100 in fresh LB or other medium of choice (Notes 3, 4 and 22).Add 1 µg/ml DiIC12 from a 100 µg/ml stock in DMSO (1% final DMSO concentration) (Notes 23 and 24).Grow at the desired temperature until the desired cell density (Notes 25 and 26).Harvest cells by centrifugation using pre-warmed (30 °C) 2 ml microtubes in a pre-warmed microtube centrifuge (up to 16,000 x g, 30 s, 30 °C).Wash 4x in pre-warmed (30 °C) LB supplemented with 1% DMSO (and other supplements like inducers or co-factors, where appropriate) (Notes 25 and 28). Keep tubes warm (30 °C) using a thermomixer while pipetting. Resuspend cells by vortexing rather than pipetting up and down to avoid shearing forces that could damage the membrane (Note 17).Resuspend in the same medium to an OD600 of 0.4.For antibiotic treatment: Prepare 50-200 µl aliquots in pre-warmed (30 °C) 2 ml microtubes and add antibiotics (or apply other condition of interest). Incubation times of 5-10 min are typically sufficient (Note 18).Withdraw 0.5 µl and spot sample on a glass slide covered with a thin layer of 1.2% agarose (Note 15). Wait until the droplet has just dried and add a coverslip without air bubbles.Search for a good field of view with a sufficient number of cells using phase contrast or bright field.Take a picture in the Cy3 channel. If the microscope is not equipped with a Cy3 filter cube, DiIC12 can also be visualized with a standard RFP filter, yet this will yield a lower fluorescence signal (Notes 27 and 28).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181017/20181017010547_7315.jpgFigure 7.

    "pneumoniae D39 (Lanie et al., 2007), and S. aureus NCTC 8325. RIFs in B. subtilis are organized by the actin homologue MreB. Interestingly, S. pneumoniae and S. aureus, both of which do not have MreB homologues, do not display clearly distinct RIFs. However, both bacteria do not show completely smooth fluorescent membranes, and the slight irregularity of the membrane stain is indicative of fluid microdomains. Treatment with rhodomyrtone, which causes fluid membrane domains (Saeloh et al., 2018), results in a clear accumulation of the DiIC12 dye in fluid membrane foci in all bacteria (yellow arrows). Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB (B. subtilis, S. aureus) or Todd-Hewitt broth supplemented with 0.5 % yeast extract (S. pneumoniae).
