    "All experiments described in this protocol conform to NIH guidelines in accordance with the guidelines specified by the University of Kansas Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Neonatal Maternal Separation (NMS)\nMonitor pregnant dams daily for litter births.\n\tNote: The day the litter is born is considered P0.\nOn P1, remove the dam from the home cage and place into a clean secondary container.\nRub a handful of bedding between clean-gloved hands to maintain scent of the home cage.\nAdd a depth of 1 - 2 cm of the home cage bedding into a clean, appropriately labeled 2 L glass beaker. Add approximately half of any additional enrichment bedding material that is present in the home cage, e.g., nestlet, crinkle paper, to the glass beaker.\nGently place all of the pups from a single litter, individually, in the same beaker.\nImmediately place the beaker in an incubator held at 33 oC and 50% humidity for 180 min.\nRemove the dam from the secondary container and return her to the home cage. Return the home cage to its appropriate housing location within the vivarium.\nRepeat this procedure for each litter undergoing NMS, using clean gloves and secondary containers for each litter/dam.\nAt the end of the 180 min separation period, return the litters to their home cages in the same order as they were removed.\nRetrieve the home cage of the first litter that was separated earlier in the day. Remove the dam from the home cage and place into a clean secondary container.\nRemove the first beaker from the incubator and rub a handful of bedding between clean gloved hands to maintain scent of the home cage while handling the pups.\nGently move the pups, individually, from the beaker to the home cage.",
    "Return any enrichment and bedding remaining in the beaker to the home cage.\nReturn the dam from the secondary container to the home cage and return it to its appropriate housing location within the vivarium.\nRinse the beaker with water and return it to the incubator. Use the same beaker for each litter throughout the separation procedure.\nRepeat this procedure for each litter undergoing NMS in the same order as they were placed in the incubator.\nRepeat this entire procedure for each litter undergoing NMS every day through P21.\nWean NMS and naïve pups on P22 by placing littermates of the same sex together in clean cages complete with food and water. Naïve pups should be born and housed under the same conditions as NMS mice, but undergo no additional handling outside of normal animal husbandry tasks.\n2. Perigenital Mechanical Sensitivity\nvon Frey Apparatus Setup\n\t\nBring the mice to the testing room and allow them to acclimate for 30 min while remaining in their home cages.\nPrepare the testing area by placing an absorbent underpad beneath an elevated wire mesh-top table (79 cm x 28 cm) that provides enough space to allow the investigator to approach from the underside without startling the mice, approximately 55 cm in height.\nPlace up to 12 mice, individually, under clear, perforated plastic chambers (11 cm x 5 cm x 3.5 cm) on top of the wire mesh table. Place a heavy object on top of the chambers to prevent mice from escaping.\nAcclimate the mice for an additional 30 min on the screen prior to withdrawal threshold assessment.\nPerigenital Mechanical Sensitivity Assessment",
    "Perform the up-down method using a standard set of graded von Frey monofilaments43. Use the following monofilaments: 1.65 g, 2.36 g, 2.83 g, 3.22 g, 3.61 g, 4.08 g, 4.31 g, and 4.74 g.\n\t\t\nHold the base of the 3.22 g monofilament and expose the retracted monofilament.\n\t\t\tNote: Some models may not have a retracted monofilament.\nSituate the probe so that the monofilament is vertically oriented and when the mouse is alert, immobile, and its body weight is distributed evenly between the hind paws apply it to either the left or right side of the scrotum, avoiding the midline, until a slight bend is observed in the filament.\nHold the monofilament in place for 10 sec or until the animal shows a positive response.\n\t\t\tNote: A positive response is considered to be a brisk jerk or jump in response to monofilament application or licking or biting behavior directed towards the monofilament. If the mouse moves during the 10 sec monofilament application without displaying these behaviors, the monofilament must be retested following a minimum 1 min-long rest period. If a mouse neither moves nor exhibits any of above listed behaviors during the 10 sec monofilament application, it is considered a negative response.\nRecord the response, either negative or positive, in a lab notebook or laptop and repeat this procedure on all of the remaining mice using the 3.22 g monofilament.\nTest all of the mice again using the next appropriate monofilament. Note: If the mouse exhibited a negative response to the 3.22 g monofilament, apply the 3.61 g monofilament in the same manner and record the response. If the mouse exhibited a positive response to the 3.22 g monofilament, apply the 2.83 g monofilament and record the response.",
    "Continue testing each mouse using the next larger or smaller monofilament, as appropriate, for an additional 4 applications after the first positive response is observed.\nReturn mice to home cages.\nUse the value of the final von Frey monofilament applied in the trial series in log units to calculate a 50% g withdrawal threshold as described in Chaplan et al.43.\n3. Acidified Toluidine Blue Mast Cell Staining\nTissue Processing\n\t\nDissect prostate tissue44 from mice that have been intracardially perfused with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde45. Postfix the tissue in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 hr at RT and then cryoprotect in 30% sucrose in 1x PBS at 4 °C O/N.\nPrepare a small (30 ml) bath of heptane and place it on dry ice.\nRinse the prostate tissue in 1x PBS and dry using a light duty wipe.\nInsert the prostate tissue into the cold heptane until it is frozen.\nImmediately place the frozen prostate tissue in a cryomold containing mounting media and place on dry ice until frozen.\nStore cryomolds at -20 °C.\nTransversely cut the prostate tissue into 7 µm-thick cryosections using a cryostat.\nPlace 8 - 12 non-serial cryosections that span the length of the tissue, onto positively-charged microscope slides.\nStore finished slides at -20 °C until further processing.\nPreparing Acidified Toluidine Blue\n\t\nAdd 1 g of Toluidine Blue O to 100 ml 70% ethanol and vortex until in solution to prepare a 1% stock solution. The stock solution can be stored at RT for up to three weeks.\nAdd 1 g NaCl to 100 ml water in a beaker placed on top of a stir plate.\nAdjust the pH of the NaCl solution using 12 M HCl until a pH range of 0.5 - 1.0 is achieved.",
    "Prepare the 0.25% Toluidine Blue working solution by combining 8 ml of the Toluidine Blue stock solution and 32 ml of the 1% NaCl solution. Pipette up and down to ensure total incorporation of the Toluidine Blue stock solution and mix using a vortex. The working solution must be made fresh and discarded after using.\nStaining Prostate Cryosections\n\t\nRemove the slides to be processed from the freezer and allow to equilibrate to RT for approximately 30 min.\nWash the tissue sections by individually dipping the slides for approximately 1 sec into a 50 ml conical tube containing a sufficient volume of 1x PBS to ensure that the slide-mounted tissue sections will be completely submerged. Allow slides to air dry on a paper towel.\nPlace slides in a glass staining jar containing enough 0.25% working Toluidine Blue solution to ensure that the slide-mounted tissue sections will be completely submerged and incubate for 10 - 15 min while on a platform rocker set at 15 rpm.\nDip slides in 1x PBS for approximately 1 sec to wash out excess Toluidine Blue.\nPlace slides in a slide box or rack in such a way that the slides are on their sides to allow for drainage.\nDry the slides in an oven at 37 °C for a minimum of 2 hrs or O/N at RT.\nDehydrate slides quickly using alcohol, allowing the slides to completely dry between alcohol exposures. Dry slides by draining on a paper towel and wiping backs and edges with a light duty wipe.\n\t\t\nImmerse the slides in 95% EtOH for approximately 1 sec and allow to completely dry. Repeat this procedure 1 - 10 times until tissue dries more blue than purple.",
    "Immerse the slides in 100% EtOH for approximately 1 sec and allow to completely dry. Repeat this procedure 1 - 10 times until tissue is dark to medium blue, but not purple.\nFix the stain by incubating the slides in 100% xylene for 3 min. Allow to dry.\nCoverslip the slides with glycerol, PBS, or xylene-based permanent mounting media. Drain excess media and store at RT.\nQuantifying Mast Cells\n\t\nVisualize the toluidine blue-stained tissue sections at 20X magnification using light microscopy (Figure 2).\nCount the total number of mast cells present within the visualized area and differentiate between non-degranulated and degranulated mast cells. 40X magnification may be necessary to confirm granulation status in some mast cells.\n\t\tNote: Non-degranulated mast cells exhibit dense metachromasia with no or faint nuclear outline and/or no granular extrusion around the cell. Degranulated mast cells exhibit less intense metachromasia and have an obvious clear outline of the nucleus and/or free granules within the cytoplasm and outside of the cell border.\nContinue to assess the total number of non-degranulated and degranulated mast cells in the entirety of the current tissue section. Repeat this procedure on at least 7 additional separate sections, spanning the length each tissue.\nCalculate the percentage of degranulated (DG) to total mast cells for each tissue/mouse according to the following equation: (DG mast cells / Total mast cells) x 100.\nSubscription Required.
