    "1. Preparing Materials\nPrepare 10 mM HEPES buffer. Adjust the pH to 7.0 at RT and add NaCl to 0.9%.\nPrepare 5% alginate solution and 10 mM EDTA solution by mixing HEPES-buffered saline prepared in 1.1. Adjust the pH to 7.0 at RT.\nAutoclave the reagents (1.1, 1.2) for 20 min at 121 °C.\nPrepare gelatin-coated 60 mm dishes layered with 1.2 − 2.0 × 106 mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells, which are treated as feeder cells by incubation within DMEM containing 10% ES-qualified FBS and 10 µg/ml of mitomycin C for 90 - 120 min.\nMaintain mouse induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells on the dish with the feeder cells in the presence of 5 ml DMEM high glucose containing 20% of ES-qualified FBS, 50 µM of 2-mercaptoethanol, non-essential amino acid, and antibiotics (100 Units/ml of Penicillin G Sodium, 100 µg/ml of streptomycin sulfate, and 250 ng/ml of amphotericin B).\nSeed 4 × 105 iPS cells on a gelatin-coated 60 mm dish and incubate them at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Change the culture medium every day during incubation. After 3 – 4 days of culture, trypsinize cells for 1 min with 500 µl of 0.05% Trypsin containing 0.02% EDTA at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After that, detach cells by tapping the culture dish ten times.",
    "Add 2.5 ml of DMEM with 10% of ES-qualified FBS and antibiotics (following dissociation mouse iPS cells into single cells by pipetting with 1,000 µl micropipette three times) centrifuge cell suspension at 160 × g for 3 min and remove supernatant and count the cells. Following cell counting, reseed the collected cells on a gelatin-coated dish and incubate for 30 min to isolate the iPS cells from the MEF cells. After counting of the cells (usually 1 – 3 × 106 cells/dish can be collected), reseed 4 × 105 iPS cells on the dish.\n2. Cell Encapsulation into Alginate Hydrogel Capsules\nCollect the cells by the same procedure described in 1.5 and 1.6. Following centrifugation at 160 × g for 3 min, wash the iPS cell pellet with HEPES-buffered saline thrice. After re-suspending the cells in HEPES-buffered saline, filter the cell suspension through a 40 µm cell strainer in order to remove large aggregates, which could otherwise clog the nozzle.\nMix 2 ml of cell suspension within HEPES-buffered saline and 3 ml of 5% Alg-Na solution. Finally 5 ml of cell suspension within 3% Alg-Na solution is obtained. Cell density is desirably more than 106 cells/ml.\nAfter collecting the cell suspension into a 5 ml syringe, install a co-axial nozzle (Figure 1A, B) on the syringe and set them on syringe pump. Emit N2 gas flow (lower than 1L/min) through the outer needle of the co-axial nozzle and expel the cell suspension through the inner nozzle.\nCollect droplets into 250 ml of 0.5% CaCl2 solution and wait 10 – 20 min for gelation while stirring at 60-90 rpm.\n3. Treatment of Alginate Capsules (optional)\nIncubate Alg-Ca capsules in 0.05 % (w/v) poly-l-lysine (PLL) solution for 5 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2.",
    "After washing the capsules with HEPES-buffered saline, incubate them in DMEM containing 10% FBS in order to neutralize the electrical charge on their surface. Utilize them as coated capsules (Figure 1C).\nIncubate the capsules in HEPES-buffered saline containing 10 mM EDTA for 5 min. The EDTA-treated capsules are utilized as hollow capsules (Figure 1C).\n4. Culture and Collect Cells in Alginate Capsules\nIncubate the encapsulated cells at 75 rpm with shaking at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 10 days.\nCollect and incubate the capsules in 10 mM EDTA at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 10 min. Collect cells from the alginate capsules without PLL treatment by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 3 min.\nIf alginate capsules are treated with PLL, break the Alg-PLL membrane by pipetting up and down around ten times with a needle attached to a syringe and centrifuge it at 1,000 - 5,000 × g for 5 min. Needle diameter should be lower than capsule size and 25 G (260 µm) needles are used in this experiment (600 µm)\nAfter centrifugation, collect cell pellet strictly from broken Alg-PLL membranes if you want to collect mRNA samples from cells. Remaining Alg-PLL membranes possibly prevent mRNA purification.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
