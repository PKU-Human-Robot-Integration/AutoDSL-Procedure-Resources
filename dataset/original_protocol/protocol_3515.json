    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis protocol is aimed at co-injecting CRC cells and colonic fibroblasts to study tumor initiation and progression. As a result of the co-injection, tumor progression is more efficient, and metastases in lymph nodes, lungs, and liver will appear. We described two different approaches for mouse models of CRC. The first one is the co-implantation of mouse tumor organoids (MTOs) and colonic fibroblasts (CFs) in the cecum. The tumor develops in about 5–8 weeks allowing the metastases. The second one is the co-implantation in the rectum. In this method, the tumors develop in 4–5 weeks which allows you to study tumor progression in a shorter time than other models. Before the injection, MTOs and CFs are trypsinized, mixed and resuspended in Advanced DMEM/F12 and BME, and placed in ice. Following the anesthesia of the mouse, the peritoneal cavity is opened to expose the cecum. After the orthotopic injection in the sub-serosal layer, the peritoneum and the skin are closed. In the case of the rectum, the rectal mucosa is exposed after anesthesia of the mouse by grabbing the ventral wall of the rectum. The injection is performed in the submucosa. In both models, mice will be monitored for tumor progression, especially in the rectum model due to the possibility of intestinal obstruction.\nPreparation of mouse tumor organoids (MTOs) and colonic fibroblasts (CFs) for injection\nTiming: 1–1.5 h\nHere, MTOs and CFs are prepared for injection. MTOs and CFs are mixed 1:1 in HBSS, centrifuged and resuspended in Advanced DMEM/F12 with BME. The proportion of BME is different depending on the injection site: for cecum, BME will be 30% of the solution, and for rectum will be 50%.\nPrewarm 0.25% trypsin-EDTA at 25°C before use.",
    "Remove the medium from the dish of MTOs at around 80% confluence (3 days after passage).\nCritical: Avoid cell passaging for at least 2 days before implantation.\nRinse the dish with PBS (2–3 mL per 1 well of 6-well plate) and aspirate the PBS.\nRepeat step 3.\nAdd cold Cell Recovery Solution (1.5 mL per 1 well of 6-well plate) followed by mechanical disaggregation of the organoid fragments by pipetting using a 1 mL micropipette.\nTransfer the organoid suspension to a 15 mL polypropylene tube and keep on ice for 40 min.\nCentrifuge the tube at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate supernatant and wash the cell pellet with 2 mL of HBSS.\nCentrifuge the tube at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate supernatant and add 500 μL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA. Place the tube in the 37°C incubator for 20–30 min.\nAdd 9.5 mL of HBSS to dilute the trypsin.\nCentrifuge the tube at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nResuspend with 1 mL of HBSS and transfer to a 1.5 mL tube\nKeep the cell suspension on ice. Transfer 10 μL of cell suspension to 1.5 mL tube and mix with 10 μL of trypan blue for counting the number of live cells.\nRemove the medium from the dish of CFs at around 80% confluence (3 days after passage).\nCritical: Avoid cell passaging for at least 2 days before implantation.\nRinse the dish with PBS (6 mL per a 10 cm dish) and aspirate the PBS.\nRepeat step 16.\nAdd 2 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA. Place the dish in the 37°C incubator for 1–3 min.\nPipet the cells with a 1 mL micropipette to detach the cells and add 8 mL of maintenance medium to dilute the trypsin.",
    "Centrifuge the tube at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nResuspend with 1 mL of HBSS and transfer to a 1.5 mL tube\nKeep the cell suspension on ice. Transfer 10 μL of cell suspension to 1.5 mL tube and mix with 10 μL of trypan blue for counting the number of live cells.\nMix 5 x 105 cells from MTOs and 5 x 105 CFs per mouse in a 1.5 mL tube.\nCentrifuge the cells mix for 7–8 s at 12,000 × g in a table-top centrifuge with fixed rotor.\nCritical: Do not centrifuge more than 7–8 s.\nFor cecum injection, resuspend the cell mix (5 x 105 cells from MTOs + 5 x 105 CFs = 1 × 106 cells per mouse) in 10 μL of 30% BME diluted in Advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with GlutaMAX and HEPES per mouse. For rectum injection, resuspend the cell mix (5 x 105 cells from MTOs + 5 x 105 CFs = 1 × 106 cells per mouse) in 10 μL of 50% BME diluted in Advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with GlutaMAX Supplement and HEPES per mouse.\nCritical: Prepare 10% more volume than the exact volume in the case of the loss during resuspending the cells or with leakage during the injection. Keep the cell suspension on wet ice.\nOrthotopic co-implantation of syngeneic MTOs and CFs in cecum (sub-serosal injection)\nTiming: ∼10–15 min per mouse\nHere, MTOs and CFs are injected into cecum. After anesthetizing the mouse, the cecum is carefully exposed and flattened. The cell suspension is injected slowly and as shallow as possible. A swelling of the cecum surface can be seen after a successful injection. After the injection, the cecum is returned to the peritoneal cavity and the peritoneum is sutured. Skin is closed using the clips.",
