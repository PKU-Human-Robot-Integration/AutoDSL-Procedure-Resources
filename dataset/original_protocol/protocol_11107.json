    "All in vivo protocols were approved by the animal ethical agencies.\n1. CTC Amplification in 3D Culture Conditions\nTo culture CTCs in suspension, first seed CTCs in wells of an Ultra-Low Attachment (ULA) 24-well plate at the maximal concentration of 5 cells/µL and into 1 mL of M12 medium (i.e., advanced DMEM-F12 supplemented with 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 Unit/mL penicillin and streptomycin, N2 supplement, 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor and 10 ng/mL fibroblast growth factor10).\nTo allow sphere formation and cell expansion, incubate the cells in hypoxic conditions (2% O2) between 6 to 10 days.\nOnce the spheres are large enough (100 µm), to prevent necrosis, dissociate them for amplification.\n\t\nPlace the cell suspension in a 2 mL tube or a 15 mL tube and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 minutes.\nRemove the supernatant and add 500 µL of gentle dissociation reagent (e.g., Accumax) to the pellet.\nVortex gently and incubate the cell suspension with gentle dissociation reagent for 20 to 30 minutes at 37 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Exceeding the incubation time in the gentle dissociation reagent (Accumax) may cause abnormal increased cell mortality.\nAdd 1.5 mL of Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) and centrifuge the tube for 5 minutes at 300 x g.\nPour off the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in fresh M12 medium to reach the density of 1-5 cells per µL.\nSeed the cell suspension in new wells of an Ultra-Low Attachment plate: 10 mL for T75 flasks, 2 mL for 6 well plates and 100 µL for 96 well plates\n2. Immuno-Fluorescence (IF) Staining on CTC Sphere Sections\nCentrifuge CTC spheres into a 15 mL tube at 300 x g for 5 min, aspirate the supernatant, and wash the pellet twice with PBS.",
    "Resuspend the pellet with 500 µL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and incubate for 20 min on ice. Centrifuge the suspension at 300 x g and wash twice with 5 mL of PBS.\nResuspend the pellet with (i.e., 15 to 20 µL) hot and liquid Histogel. With a pipette, take all the suspension and make a droplet on a precooled surface at 4 °C and let it polymerize for 5 to 10 minutes.\n\tNOTE: Work fast to avoid the polymerization of the suspension into the tip.\nDetach the solid droplet with the blade of a scalpel and insert it into a compartmented embedding cassette.\nPerform the following steps: paraffin inclusion, paraffin sectioning, section rehydration, antigen retrieval and antibody incubation. These steps are the same as for any tumor or organ embedded in paraffin and processed for immunofluorescence staining12.\n\tNOTE: The cassette can be stored in 70% ethanol at 4 °C until paraffin embedding.\n3. Cytometry Analysis\nCentrifuge CTC spheres into a 15 mL tube at 300 x g for 5 min and wash the pellet twice with PBS.\nAspirate the supernatant and add 500 µL of the gentle dissociation reagent to the pellet.\nVortex gently and incubate the cell suspension with the gentle dissociation reagent for 20 to 30 min at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: Exceeding 40 min of incubation in the gentle dissociation reagent (Accumax) may result in an abnormal increased cell mortality.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension for 5 min at 300 x g, eliminate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 5 mL of blocking buffer (i.e., PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)).\nPass the cell suspension through a 40 µm cell strainer to eliminate the remaining spheres.",
    "After counting, put 200,000 cells into three fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) tubes, centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min and remove the supernatant. Use one of the three FACS tube as a control that will not receive any staining reagents.\nAccording to the datasheet, add the appropriate antibody into the two remaining FACS tubes (i.e., one conjugated antibody against the protein of interest, one conjugated isotype control).\nAfter the recommended incubation time, add 300 µL of the blocking buffer to wash the cells, centrifuge the 3 tubes at 300 x g and aspirate the supernatant. Repeat this step twice. Then, resuspend the pellet with the blocking buffer with a cell viability staining reagent (except for the FACS tube control without any staining).\nKeep the tubes on ice until FACS analysis. Use first the tube without staining to identify the gate for the cell viability and the antibody staining. Then analyze the FACS tube with the conjugated antibody against the protein of interest, to quantify the percentage of CTC expressing the protein of interest. The FACS tube with the conjugated isotype control should not indicate a shift. This confirms that the shift is specific to the targeted protein of interest.\n\t​NOTE: If possible, use a cell line expressing a high level of protein of interest as a positive control and a cell line that does not express the protein as a negative control.\n4. Luminescence Viability Assay (CellTiter-Glo)\nResuspend dissociated CTCs (as described in section 1.4.5) in M12 medium. Count the cells and adapt the cell concentration to 200,000 cells/mL.\nIn a ULA 96-well plate, seed 10,000 dissociated CTCs per well, in 50 µL, and incubate the plate in hypoxia (2% O2) for 24 h.",
    "The following day, add 50 µL of the tested drug to the CTCs. It is previously recommended to perform a titration of the drug concentration, to determine the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50). Treat some wells with vehicle only to determine basal cell viability.\n\tNOTE: The number of cells seeded may differ between CTC lines, depending on their doubling time. In addition, cells should be seeded in triplicates to minimize results variability.\nIncubate plates in hypoxia for another 48 h.\nAt day 3, place the cultured plates and the luminescence cell viability buffer and substrate at room temperature and reconstitute the substrate with an appropriate volume of buffer, according to manufacturer protocol.\nAdd 70 µL of the luminescence viability mix into each cultured plate well. Put plates on an orbital shaker for 20 min to induce cell lysis and then transfer 100 µL of the mix into an opaque-walled multi-well plate, compatible with the luminometer.\nAllow the plate to rest at room temperature, cover it with aluminum foil in order to stabilize the luminescent signal.\n\t​NOTE: Luminescent signal is stable for up to 3 hours.\nRecord luminescence using a microplate reader (i.e., Tecan Infinite 200 Pro).\nFor data analysis, calculate the mean of the triplicate relative light unit RLU per condition. To assess the percentage of viability according to each drug concentration needed: (RLU of treated cells/RLU of untreated cells) x 100.\n5. Subcutaneous Injections\nIn a microcentrifuge tube, resuspend cells in 100 µL of sterile PBS. If the number of injected cells is low, resuspend cells in 1:1 PBS/Matrigel, reduced in growth factors, to concentrate cells together and promote tumor initiation.",
    "NOTE: Cell density can be from 10 cells (to challenge the tumor initiation capacity) to 1 million of cells depending on the scientific question and the aim of the experiment.\nPull up the full volume in an insulin syringe.\nOn an immune-deficient mouse, pinch the skin of the flank between the index and the ring finger and gently insert the needle at the base of the skin.\n\tNOTE: This procedure is not painful and is done on conscious mice.\nSlowly inject the volume in the same spot to prevent the spreading of the cells. This will create a small bleb beneath the skin.\nApply gentle pressure on the injection site to prevent the backflow of the volume.\nMonitor the tumor growth, every other day, using a caliper.\nSacrifice the animal if the tumor exceeds 1500 mm3. Depending on the material availability, euthanize the mice by carbon dioxide or anaesthetic gases inhalation or by cervical dislocation.\n6. Intrasplenic Injection\nBefore starting, autoclave the surgical instruments (scissors and forceps) at 124 °C for 15 min and clean out all surfaces of the working space with 70% ethanol.\nIn a microcentrifuge tube, resuspend cells in 50 µL of sterile PBS and store them on ice. Cell density can go from 0.5 to 1 million cells. A larger number of cells can cause a clots development into the blood circulation.\nPrior to injecting the cells, inject 100 µL of 0.015 mg/mL buprenorphine subcutaneously, for pain relief.\nPlace the mouse in an induction chamber, where isoflurane is maintained at 3%, for 2-3 min. When the animal is no longer responsive to movement, put it on its right-hand side on a heating pad and maintain the anaesthesia using a breathing circuit face mask that delivers a gas mixture of O2 and isoflurane.",
    "Apply eye lubricant over each eye to avoid eye drying during the surgery. Disinfect the thoracic area with Povidone-iodine solution (i.e. Betadine).\nOn the dorsoventral side, make a small incision of 0.5 cm using scissors below the 10th false rib.\nGently lift the spleen out and lay it on sterile gauze. Using an insulin syringe, inject the 50 µL of CTCs in the tip of the spleen. Make sure to maintain the syringe upright and wait 3-5 min to avoid backflow, and then remove the needle.\nLigate the splenic vessels from the two sides (arteries and veins) and remove the spleen by cutting directly above the two ligatures. The spleen is removed to prevent unwanted tumor formation in this organ.\nStitch the abdominal peritoneum and then the skin using 5.0 degradable sterile sutures.\nKeep the mouse warm until its full recovery from anesthesia.\nMonitor the mouse 3 days per week for abnormal bodily function, abnormal movement and posture and for weight loss.\nSacrifice the animal when humane end points reach (approximately 6 weeks after the surgery) to analyze liver metastasis.\nSubscription Required.
