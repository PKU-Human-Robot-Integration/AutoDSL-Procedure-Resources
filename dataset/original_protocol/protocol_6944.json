    "Protein expression (Figure 3)Prepare, under sterile conditions, a saturated overnight culture of the MIG (or sfGFP) expression strain by inoculating a culture tube containing 5 ml LB media and 5 μl of 25 mg/ml (1,000×) chloramphenicol stock solution.Incubate at 37°C and 250 RPM for approximately 16 h.Under sterile conditions, dilute 1 ml of the overnight culture into 50 ml LB media and 50 μl 25 mg/ml (1,000×) chloramphenicol stock solution.Incubate at 37°C and 250 RPM for 90 min.Under sterile conditions, add 50 μl 1 M IPTG (final concentration of 1 mM IPTG).Incubate at 37°C and 250 RPM for 60 min.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4121/bioprotoc-11-16-4121-g003.jpgFigure 3. Steps for protein expression. Image generated using Biorender.Cell lysis (Figure 4)Transfer to 50 ml conical tube.Spin to pellet at 4,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature (~22°C).Discard supernatant without disturbing pellet.Resuspend pellet in 1 ml MIG buffer.Sonicate on ice (35% intensity) for 10 s on, then 10 s off for 2 min.Transfer lysed cells into 1.5 ml tube.Spin at 4°C and 16,000 × g for 10 min.Without disturbing pellet, transfer supernatant into 1.5 ml tube and place on ice.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4121/bioprotoc-11-16-4121-g004.jpgFigure 4. Steps for cell lysis. Image generated using Biorender.Protein splicingPipette 45 μl of supernatant into a 1.5 ml tube, add 15 μl 4× Laemmli dye and mix, and place at -20°C.Note: This is time point 0. Pipette 495 μl of supernatant and 5 μl ddH2O into a 1.5 ml tube and incubate under foil at room temperature (~21°C).In another 1.5 ml tube, pipette 99 μl supernatant and 1 μl 10 mM zinc acetate dihydrate and incubate under foil at room temperature (~21°C).At 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h time points, take 45 μl from the tube without zinc acetate dihydrate and pipette into a new 1.",
    "5 ml tube, add 15 μl 4× Laemmli dye and mix, and place at -20°C.Note: The rate of protein splicing is highly variable depending on the intein and incubation conditions. Adjust time points accordingly. These conditions are for the Mycobacterium smegmatis DnaBi1 intein. At the 24-hour time point, take 45 μl from the tube with supernatant and zinc acetate dihydrate and pipette into new 1.5 ml tubes, add 15 μl 4× Laemmli dye and mix, and place at -20°C.Tris-Glycine SDS-PAGEThaw samples at room temperature.Do not heat samples prior to electrophoresis.Note: Heating will denature sfGFP and result in loss of fluorescent signal (Figure 2). Add 1× running buffer to electrophoresis tank.Insert Tris-Glycine gel into the electrophoresis gel holder and add gel holder to tank.Add 1× running buffer inside of electrophoresis gel holder to cover gel wells.Load 4 μl ladder and 6 μl of each sample.Connect tank to power supply and run gel at 200 V for 40 min.Remove gel from plastic shell and place in ddH2O.Image GelMeasure in-gel fluorescence using a Amersham 600 Imager or an equivalent imager capable of detecting sfGFP fluorescence (Figure 5).Lay gel flat on imaging tray.Place tray in imager.Set imager to Epi-RGB: Blue light (460 nm, Filter Cy2).Set exposure to auto with high dynamic range.Save picture of gel as tiff or jpeg. Relative fluorescence can be calculated by densitometry using ImageJ.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4121/bioprotoc-11-16-4121-g005.jpgFigure 5.
