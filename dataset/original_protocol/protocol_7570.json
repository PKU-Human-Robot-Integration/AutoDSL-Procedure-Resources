    "Preparation of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) Draw human whole blood into a vacuum tube with trisodium citrate.Note: PRP is approximately 30%–40% of whole blood volume. Minimum volume of whole blood needed depends on number of assays to be performed [300 μL of PRP per assay is required, plus 500 μL to prepare platelet poor plasma (PPP) for background]. Centrifuge tube at 200× g with no brake for 10 min at room temperature.Transfer PRP layer using a 3 mL Pasteur pipette to a 15 mL centrifuge tube.Store the capped PRP sample at room temperature until ready for use, for no longer than 3 h.Note: Platelets can be activated if stored at 4 °C, affecting subsequent platelet function assays. Preparation of platelet-poor plasma Transfer 0.5 mL of PRP to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.Centrifuge tube at 1,000× g for 10 min at room temperature.Transfer the supernatant to another 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and label the tube PPP.Preparation of patient antibody from serum or plasma Centrifuge patient serum or plasma at 10,000× g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove any cells or debris. Fresh or frozen patient serum or plasma collected in ACD, EDTA, or sodium citrate can be used.Transfer a minimum of 0.5 mL of supernatant to a clean microcentrifuge tube.Add Protein G agarose beads to patient serum or plasma at a 1:1 ratio; then, transfer the mixture to a clean 1.5 cm × 10 cm Econo-Column® chromatography column.Incubate the column on a rotatory tube mixer at 4 °C for 2 h.Place the column into the AKTA purifier chromatography system.Wash the column with at least 10× the sample volume of washing buffer. Check the chromatography trace remains at baseline to confirm that the column has been washed sufficiently.Add 100 μL of neutralization buffer to 1.",
    "5 mL microcentrifuge collection tubes and place them on ice.Add 1× the sample volume of elution buffer to the column to elute bound immunoglobulins. Collect the fraction containing the protein peak in aliquots of 900 μL into the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes containing 100 μL of neutralization buffer. Invert the tubes to mix.Pool eluted antibody and transfer to a 100 kDa Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit.Centrifuge the Amicon Ultra-15 unit at 4,000× g for 15–20 min. Add 14 mL of PBS and repeat the centrifugation step twice to significantly reduce the concentration of the original buffer. Once buffer exchange to PBS is completed, transfer mixture and aliquot into 2 mL Eppendorf tubes.Pipette 2 μL of sample into a sample membrane and 2 μL of buffer onto another membrane on a direct detect assay-free card.Place card into the direct detect infrared spectrometer to dry and measure the sample concentration, setting the buffer as the blank. Expected sample concentration is approximately 7–10 mg/mL.Note: Other methods such as Bradford assay can be used to determine antibody concentration. The quality of the purified IgG can be tested using assays such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to confirm binding of purified IgG to antigen. Purity can be confirmed by SDS PAGE gel. The presence of multimeric IgG can be analyzed using size exclusion chromatography. Keep antibody in -80 °C freezer for long-term storage until required or at 4 °C for use the following day.Measuring antibody activity by platelet aggregation Transfer 300 μL of PPP into a cuvette. Place cuvette into the reference slot of the aggregometer (100% light transmission, used as a blank) (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4804/bioprotoc-13-17-4804-g002.jpgFigure 2.

    "Aggregometer setup for running four samples concurrently.Set temperature to 37 °C and stirring speed to 1,200 revolutions per minute (rpm) and select optical mode on the aggregometer.For each agonist to be tested, transfer 300 μL of PRP into each cuvette containing a stir bar.Place PRP cuvettes into heating slots for 2 min to warm up to 37 °C; then, place cuvettes into the measuring slot and ensure stir bars are stirring evenly.Set baseline on the aggregometer.Pipette reagent to be assessed into a cuvette containing 300 μL of PRP. Reagents include patient sera (5–50 μL), purified patient IgG (0.1–2 mg/mL), negative controls (equivalent amounts of sera or purified IgG from a healthy donor or buffer), or positive controls (0.5–1 U/mL thrombin, 1 μg/mL collagen, or 50 μL of weak positive HIT patient serum with 0.1 U/mL heparin to allow for detection of weak pathogenic antibodies).Note: Agonist or control volumes should not exceed 150 μL. Select Aggregometer, Run a new patient, or click Run new icon on the Aggro/Link software.Acquire data for 15–30 min (or until platelet aggregation has completed).Exporting and analyzing data Export image and raw data in del file format from the Aggro/Link software.Open raw data file in Excel.Replot datapoints into GraphPad Prism.Obtain AUC, maximum aggregation %, velocity, and latency time from Aggro/Link software."
