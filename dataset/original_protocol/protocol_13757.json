  "procedures": [
    "Procedures were approved by the University of Maryland, Baltimore Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Approval #0320017) and conformed to National Institutes of Health guidelines for ethical animal research. Five adult male Yorkshire swine weighing between 50 and 70 kg were enrolled into the study. This study utilized a digital data collection system and paired software to record all hemodynamic and temperature data. Measuring cardiac parameters in the swine model consisted of the following steps: preparation, thermodilution, ventriculography, PV-loop catheter insertion, and finally euthanasia. All five animals underwent each of the three cardiac output measuring protocols.\n1.  Animal selection and housing\nUse adolescent male Yorkshire swine (Sus Scrofa) weighing 50-70 kg.\nHouse animals in caging at least 30 square feet in area with high-carbon bedding such as hay, straw, or pine shavings. House the animal individually, the night prior to the procedure.\nAllow acclimation period for new animals as per institution guidelines.\n\tNOTE: This is typically 48-72 h for large mammals7.\nFeed animals a standard diet and provide free access to water until the night before the experiment.\nFast the animals the night before the procedure to minimize aspiration risk during endotracheal intubation.\nMonitor animals' health weekly by inspecting the skin for signs of injury such as scabs, scrapes, or abrasions. Ensure normal work of breathing (15-30 breaths/min) and proper, interactive behavior. Ensure that the oral mucosa is pink, moist, and without discharge.\n\t\nWeigh animals regularly to confirm that they have adequate nutrition. Report any abnormalities to the veterinary staff and then exclude the animal from the protocol.\n2. Sedation and induction of general anesthesia\nSedate the animal in its housing area by intramuscular injection of Telazol (4-5 mg/kg)/ Xylazine (1.8-2.2 mg/kg) in the fat pad caudal to the ear.",
    "Wait until the animal is fully sedated and there is minimal to no response to stimulation to ensure safe handling and transport of the animal.\nTransport the animal from the housing area to the procedure room and place it in dorsal recumbency on the operating table.\nPlace a pulse oximetry probe on the animal's ear and begin ventilating the animal with a snout mask using a mechanical ventilator with 100% O2. Ensure proper seal of rubber gasket of the mask around the snout. Once a proper seal is ensured, administer 3-4% isoflurane until general anesthesia is induced and the jaw is relaxed.\n\tNOTE: Be sure to follow institutional guidelines for inhaled volatile agent use. In general, the procedure room must be well ventilated, and a proper scavenging/ventilation mechanism must be used to eliminate inhalation exposure.\nPlace an orotracheal tube using a laryngoscope by turning off the isoflurane vaporizer and removing the snout mask. Have a second person hold the jaws open while the operator inserts the laryngoscope and displaces the epiglottis ventrally away from the soft palate. Once the vocal cords are visualized, insert an 8-0 endotracheal (ET) tube through vocal cords by at least 5 cm.\nInflate the ET cuff with 10 mL of air and secure the ET tube to the animal's snout using umbilical tape. Confirm the tube placement by the chest rise, end-tidal CO2, and/or chest auscultation.\nConnect the ET tube to the anesthetic machine with a heat and moisture exchanger.\nAdjust the mechanical ventilator settings to deliver an inspired O2 fraction of 30%, with a tidal volume 7-10 mL/kg, and a respiratory rate of 10-16 breaths/min, to maintain an end-tidal CO2 tension of 38-42 mmHg.",
    "Return and maintain inhaled anesthetic using 1.5-3% isoflurane. Monitor the animal for signs of pain and discomfort such as involuntary movements or tachycardia. Adjust isoflurane until movements extinguish or tachycardia resolves.\n3. Surgical site sterilization and preparation\nClip the hair overlying and percutaneous access sites (bilateral ventral neck) by using an electric hair clipper.\nPrepare and scrub all percutaneous puncture sites with betadine and isopropyl alcohol and allow to dry completely.\nPlace sterile drapes around the operative sites to preserve the sterile surgical fields and prevent contamination. Secure these in place with staples.\nSecure the animal to the operating table by restraining forelimbs and hindlimbs to the table using either tape or rope. Place the heating pad underneath the animal and set to 37 °C.\nApply a water-based lubricant to the tip of the temperature probe and insert the probe into the rectum to provide continuous body temperature data.\nPlace the ECG adhesive electrodes on the right and left lateral chest wall. Attach the ECG leads to the adhesive electrodes and connect ECG leads to the data collection unit.\nCarefully, flip the animal to ventral recumbency, ensuring that the airway tubing and ECG leads are controlled during transfer.\n4. External jugular vein cannulation\nNOTE: Jugular venous access is obtained for the right atrial venous cannula insertion during the thermodilution procedure.\nUse ultrasound (US) guidance to locate the external jugular vein in the jugular furrow located in the lateral neck region. Puncture the skin with an 18 G needle placed at a 45° angle to the skin and advance the tip into the venous lumen under US guidance.\nPass an 0.035\" Seldinger guidewire through the needle and into the venous lumen. Remove the needle while leaving the guidewire in place within the venous lumen.",
    "Make a 5 mm skin incision adjacent to the wire using a #11 blade scalpel, and thread a 15 cm, 7 Fr sheath with a dilator into the vein over the guidewire. Remove the guidewire and the dilator. Ensure that the sheath remains in position. Stitch the sheath in place by suturing it to the skin with 3-0 silk sutures.\nRepeat steps 4.1 through 4.3 to cannulate the contralateral external jugular vein.\n5. Carotid artery cannulation\nNOTE: The carotid artery cannulation is performed to provide access to the LV and aortic root during thermodilution, contrast ventriculography, and PV-loop catheter insertion.\nLocate the carotid artery lateral to the trachea using an US probe. Ensure pulsatile flow using color Doppler imaging if available.\nPuncture the skin with an 18 G needle placed at a 45° angle to the skin and advance it into the arterial lumen under US vision. Advance an 0.035\" Seldinger guidewire through the needle and into the arterial lumen. Remove the needle while leaving the guidewire in position within the arterial lumen.\nMake a 5 mm skin incision adjacent to the wire with a #11 blade scalpel, and thread a 20 cm 7 Fr sheath with a dilator into the artery over the guidewire. Leave 5-10 cm of the sheath outside of the skin. Remove the guidewire and the dilator and ensure that the sheath remains in position. Secure the sheath in place by suturing it to the skin with 3-0 silk sutures8.\n6. Cardiac output measurement\nNOTE: All of the following methods are performed sequentially in each of the 5 animals used in this study.\nThermodilution\n\t\nInsert a T-type thermocouple probe via the carotid arterial sheath and guide the probe into the aortic root using fluoroscopic guidance.",
    "Attach the probe to the data collection system. Allow several minutes of data collection to establish a confident baseline aortic temperature. A confident baseline temperature is achieved when the temperature stays within 1 °C of the central value over 2-3 min of data collection.\nNext, insert a 5 Fr, 110 cm catheter via the external jugular vein sheath and navigate the catheter to the right atrium using fluoroscopy.\nOnce the position is verified, forcefully flush 20 mL of 12 °C saline into the catheter.\nObserve the temperature deflection curve on the data collection software. Highlight this region and use the cardiac output function of the software to calculate cardiac output (Figure 1).\nRepeat this process 3-5 times as needed to obtain an average value across these measurements.\nVentriculography\n\t\nUsing portable x-ray fluoroscopic guidance, insert a 0.035\" guidewire via the carotid arterial sheath and into the left ventricle. Advance the sheath so that the tip traverses the aortic valve. Remove the 0.035\" guide wire and insert an 80-cm marker pigtail catheter via the carotid arterial sheath so that the pigtail is resting in the LV apex. Withdraw the sheath 5 cm while leaving the pigtail in place so that the sheath is no longer within the LV.\n\t\t\nEnsure that all personnel in the room are wearing 0.5 mm lead apron equivalents. Have anyone within 1 m of the emitter wear leaded glasses.\nMinimize the beam-on time and ensure that the emitter is well collimated to reduce exposure to lab personnel.\nEnsure that all personnel stand as far away from emitter as possible while still being able to perform the procedure in order to reduce exposure.\nAttach the catheter to a contrast power injector with at least 30 mL of iodinated contrast loaded. Note the current heart rate of the animal.",
    "Configure the power injector to deliver 15 mL/s of contrast for a total of 30 mL and arm the device.\nConfigure the fluoroscope for digital subtraction angiography (DSA) at 30 frames/s at 30° left anterior obliquity.\nStart DSA on the fluoroscope and wait for the image to subtract. Begin the power injection as soon as the subtraction image is shown by the fluoroscopy machine. Do this by pressing the injector button as soon as the fluoroscopy machine subtracts the radio-opaque material from the image so that only the LV chamber is opacified during the image series (Figure 2A).\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, classical fluoroscopy can be used for ventriculography if DSA is unavailable.\nUpload these images to a picture archiving and communication system (PACS).\nImport the ventriculogram images into a quantitative imaging software.\nUsing the left ventricular analysis function, calibrate the software to the image using the 1 cm marks on the marker pigtail as a reference.\nClick on the End Diastole button and search the DSA images for the frame depicting the largest LV volume indicating end-diastole. Then, trace the LV border using the mouse in small increments to ensure accuracy.\nNext click on the End Systole button and search for the frame depicting end systole where LV volume is the least. Again, trace the LV border in the same manner as the previous step.\nClick the Analyze button. The program then performs quantitative volumetric analysis using the Dodge-Sandler area-length method9 to calculate end-systolic volume, end-diastolic volume, as well as stroke-volume. The data is then output in an LV analysis document.\nDetermine the cardiac output by multiplying the measured stroke volume by the previously recorded heart rate.\nPressure-volume loop catheter",
    "Presoak the PV-loop catheter in normal saline for at least 20 min prior to the use. Connect the catheter to the data collection system.\nInsert the tip of the PV-loop catheter containing the pressure transducer into a syringe of saline and hold the pressure transducer just underneath the meniscus. Using the coarse and fine adjustment buttons on the catheter module, adjust the output pressure signal until it reads 0 mmHg on the data collection software.\nCalibrate the PV-loop catheter blood resistivity and stroke volume per the manufacturer's instructions.\n\t\tNOTE: The manufacturer suggests using a blood resistivity of 1.5 mΩ and a stroke volume of 60 mL for large animal models.\nAs in step 6.2.1, insert a 0.035\" guidewire into the carotid arterial sheath and advance it into the LV using fluoroscopic guidance. Advance the sheath until it traverses the aortic valve. Remove the guidewire leaving the sheath in place and insert the PV-loop catheter under fluoroscopic guidance via the carotid arterial sheath until the pigtail portion is resting in the LV apex (Figure 2B). Withdraw the sheath ~5 cm so that it is no longer within the LV while leaving the pigtail in place.\nPer manufacturer instructions, perform a baseline scan prior to collecting data by navigating to the Baseline scan option on the data acquisition screen and press the Enter button. A baseline scan is taken using the PV-loop catheter system to confirm accurate heart rate measurement. Press the Enter button again to begin pressure and volume data acquisition. The volume segments can be scrolled through to acquire the best volume waveform.",
    "Check the pressure volume curve being output to the data collection software. Ensure that the PV-loop is recorded adequately, which should be rectangular with smooth edges. (Figure 2C). If not, gently reposition the catheter either by twisting, or moving back and forth until an adequate loop is recorded. Calculate stroke volume and cardiac output by multiplying the heart rate by the difference between the end-diastolic and end-systolic volume.\nSecure the catheter in place either with tape or suture to ensure adequate positioning throughout.\n7. Euthanasia\nEuthanize the animal using >2 mEq/kg potassium chloride (50-70 mL of 2 mEq/mL KCl) injection via the jugular vein sheath.\nContinue general anesthesia and cardiac monitoring until ECG tracing shows no cardiac electrical activity and end-tidal CO2 tension reaches 0 mmHg.\n\tNOTE: Hemodynamic monitoring was maintained throughout the experiment.\nSubscription Required.
