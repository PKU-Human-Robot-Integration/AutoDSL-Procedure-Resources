    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nWhole-brain dissections and washes\nTiming: 1 h 15 min per 5 brains\nHeads are first fixed in PFA, the brains are dissected in PFA and later washed in PBT.\nAnesthetize 50-day old F1 females in a pad with CO2.\nNote: Process different genotypes separately.\nBriefly wash flies in 70% ethanol in a petri dish to remove waxy coating and place them in a drop of ice-cold PBS in a dissecting chamber.\nDecapitate flies and remove the proboscis while still in PBS, and then transfer the heads to a drop of ice-cold 4% PFA in the dissecting chamber.\nFix heads for 15 min in this drop of 4% PFA.\nDissect brain in a new drop of ice-cold 4% PFA in the dissecting chamber.\nCritical: It is important that the brains are not over fixed in PFA as it may result in higher levels of background fluorescence. To avoid this, dissect a few brains at a time (suggestion max. 5 brains). An alternative is to start dissecting the brains in 4% PFA right after the heads are transferred to 4% PFA and then leave them in the drop until 15 minutes has elapsed, and then proceed to the washing step.\nPlace brains in a 74 μm mesh netwell inside the 12-well plate (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]) containing washing buffer.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1676-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Plate and netwells for staining and washes\n(A–C) Suggested netwells (A) and plate (B) for brain washes and suggested workflow (C).",
    "Note: From step 6 onwards, the protocol can be performed in the plate with the netwells (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C). Brains can be added to the netwell and only the netwell is transferred from one well to the other. This avoids the need to wash brains in microcentrifuge tubes and pipette buffers in and out, reducing the chances of losing brains that get stuck on the tips of the pipettes.\nAlternatives: In the absence of the netwells and plate, a microcentrifuge tube can be used, and solutions can be added and removed from the tube with a pipette.\nWash brains 2 times in 0.1% PBT for 30 min each at room temperature with gentle agitation.\nWash brains 1 time in PBS for 30 min at room temperature with gentle agitation.\nEosin staining and mounting\nTiming: 16 h\nEosin staining of fixed and washed fly brains, followed by mounting brains on a slide.\nAdd 2 mL of Eosin into a clean well and transfer the netwell with the brains to the eosin. Stain brains for 3 min at room temperature and gentle agitation.\nCritical: Eosin is toxic and flammable. Wear protective equipment, and keep away from heat, sparks, open flames, and hot surfaces.\nNote: The same 2 mL of eosin can be used to stain several samples within 1 hour. The eosin is diluted in ethanol, and if the ethanol is left outside for long periods of time it evaporates concentrating the eosin which can lead to staining variability.\nWash brains 2 times in PBS for 30 min each at room temperature with gentle agitation.\nWash brains 1 time in 0.1% PBT for 10 min at room temperature with gentle agitation.\nWash brain 1 time in 0.1% PBT overnight at 4°C with gentle agitation.",
    "Critical: it is important to wash overnight. A shorter wash will not be enough to remove all the excess of eosin.\nPlace the brains on a printed slide in a drop of VECTASHIELD.\nNote: Brains can be transferred from the netwell/plate to the slide by aspirating them with a pipette and dispensing them on the slides. Under the scope pick one brain at a time with the help of a tweezer by lifting it from underneath and place it in a drop of mounting media in the desired well.\nNote: It is suggested that the brains are placed on a printed slide so the coverslip does not squeeze the brains.\nAlternatives: As an alternative to the printed slides, bridges on the slides can be made with 2–3 layers of transparent tape or coverslips.\nNote: Orient the brains in the desired way. In this protocol, the back of the brain is facing the coverslip, so to start imaging from back region close to the Calyx of the Mushroom Body (CA) region (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nAdd coverslip and seal with nail polish.\nPause point: mounted slides can be kept covered at 4°C for at least 4 months prior to imaging.\nImaging\nTiming: 2 min per brain\nLocalize CA area in the brain in the confocal microscope (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nImage brains using the 488 nm laser and acquire the images with 1024 × 1024 pixels and 8-bit resolution (for optimal software readout). Other parameters such as laser power, averaging, zoom may vary.\nUse 40× magnification to better visualize the vacuoles and other brain structures.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1676-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Image quantification with Fiji and CheeseMaker Tool\n(A) Representative images of control and disease brains after 50 days on RU-486 food. First panel shows eosin staining, second shows area fraction quantified by CheeseMaker tool, and third one is a merge. Scale bar: 50 μm.\n(B) Graph showing quantification of area fraction (%) (mean +- standard error of the mean). T-test was applied (Elav-GS>UASLacZ: n = 4; Elav-GS>UASAβ42arc n = 4; p < 0.0001).\nNote: Depending on the microscope and on the tissue the imaging settings may vary. Adjustment to the images can be done later in Fiji (ex. Convert to 8-bit, reduce background).\nNote: Using this fly strain, we noticed that the vacuoles are concentrated in the areas where the Mushroom Body Kenyon cells are located, at the Calyx (CA), close to the surface of the back of the brain (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). Thus, we took a single snapshot at the CA region to perform vacuoles analysis (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6] and 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).",
    "Critical: If using a confocal microscope, it is important to orient the brains properly on the slide while mounting because the laser does not have much penetrance. The deeper it gets, the lower the fluorescence intensity will be, meaning only the first half of the brain will be good to be imaged (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D). Thus, using this approach, the CA region is closer to the coverslip and a single snapshot can be taken without any problems of laser penetrance. However, if desirable to acquire a z-stack, other settings can be used to acquire images deeper in the tissue, such as laser strength, signal detection, z-correction and gain.\nInstall Fiji/CheeseMaker Tool\nTiming: 5 min\nWe have developed a plugin in ImageJ/Fiji to assist in the image analysis. CheeseMaker is a non-analytical ImageJ/Fiji tool to quantify the relative area occupied by the non-eosin-stained tissue (vacuoles) on a manually selected area of interest of a single confocal section of the Drosophila brain stained with eosin (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nDownload and Install Fiji: https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads[href=https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads].\nUpdate Fiji and install plugins:\nClick in the main menu: Help>Update…>Manage Update Sites.\nIn this window click the checkboxes of the following plugins:\n3D ImageJ Suite.\nBoneJ.\nclij.\nclij2.\nclij-assistant.\nclij-assistant-extensions.\nIJPB-plugins.\nClick the “Close” button on the Manage Update Sites window.\nClick the “Apply changes” button on ImageJ Updater window.\nDownload the CheeseMaker Tool from the GitHub repository.\nOpen GitHub link: https://github.com/gbarbosabio/CheeseMaker[href=https://github.com/gbarbosabio/CheeseMaker].\nClick green “Code” button and click “Download ZIP” button.\nDownload compressed file: “CheeseMaker-main”. Decompress downloaded file.\nOpen Fiji, click, Plugin>Install…\nFind decompressed folder CheeseMaker-main.\nClick file “CheeseMaker.ijm” to open.\nIn the window “Save Plugin, Macro or Script”, move up one level to the folder “Fiji.App”, click on the folder “macros”, then “toolsets”, and finally click “Save”. To complete installation, close Fiji and reopen.",
    "To activate the CheeseMaker tool in the tool bar, click on the toolbar button at the far right: “More Tools” “>>” and click “CheeseMaker”. One new button should appear on the Fiji Tools Bar: “CheeseMaker tool” (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nImage analysis using CheeseMaker Tool\nTiming: 1 min/image\nThis section describes how to quantify vacuoles using CheeseMaker Tool in a single image (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nOpen image in Fiji.\nClick on the CheeseMaker Tool button located at the Toolbar (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nClick on the image to be analyzed. A window will pop-up saying “Define the ROI using a selection tool” (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nClick on the desired selection tool from the Toolbar and define a ROI in the image (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nClick “Ok” on the Cheese Selector window (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C).\nThe CheeseMaker tool will process and analyze the image in the defined ROI and show all the steps in different windows including a Results window (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D).\nSave the results and the images of interest.\nClose all opened images.\nOpen a new image and repeat steps 2 through 6 in this section.\nNote: Before using the CheeseMaker tool, make sure images are converted to 8-bit (Image>Type>8 bit) if they were acquired using other bits per pixel settings.",
    "Note: Once the CheeseMaker Tool is activated in ImageJ, the user selects an area of interest, and the tool will segment the selected area into two categories: with and without eosin staining. The segmentation steps involve: 1- Thresholding the pixels which the ratio of staining signal/Gaussian background (sigmax=30.5, sigmay=30.5, sigmaz=10.0) signal are below 0.3 (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D′′′). This will segment pixels which contain no eosin staining or very low signal in relationship to the nearby background. 2- Three rounds of dilation and erosion (Morphological Closing) (Legland et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]) are applied to every thresholded pixel with low eosin staining (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D′′′′). This process considers a vacuole 5 nearby pixels in the shape of a cross that are black; it removes isolated non-black pixels and removes any deformities on the edges of the tissue by closing narrow gaps between proximal thresholded areas. CheeseMaker Tool is assisted by a pipeline generated with CLIJ2 (Haase et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]) and estimates the Area Fraction (percentage) occupied by the vacuoles inside a Region of Interest (ROI) (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D). This tool does not analyze morphological aspects of the vacuoles (such as size, area or shape)."
