    "NOTE: A general view of the experimental procedure is graphically illustrated in Figure 1A. All experiments with mice performed in this study were approved by our institution's Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). We used 3-month-old C57BL6/J mice, which were housed in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC)-approved vivarium, under the care of a veterinarian. The mice lived in large cages, with a 12 h light-dark cycle, and were fed ad libitum.\n1. Conception and pregnancy verification\nPlace mice of any background and genotype of interest for breeding. Record the date and the weight of the female before conception.\nAfter 6 h, inspect the female for a plaque with a probe. If the plaque is present, separate the female from the male. If the plaque is not present, keep the female in the cage until the next day, then separate the mice.\nAt days 7, 10, and 14 post conception, weigh the female to confirm pregnancy.\n2. Media, 24-well plate, and material preparation\nOn the day of cell isolation, place, ready-to-use, poly-D-lysine-coated glass coverslips (see Table of Materials) in a 24-well plate as follows:\n\t\nUnder a biological hood, sterilize a single package containing 15 coverslips with 70% ethanol and let dry. Open the package and place the coverslips in a 60 mm plate. Shake the plate horizontally to separate the coverslips. Then, invert the plate to pick up single coverslips to be placed in the wells of a 24-well plate.\nWash the coverslips one time with 1.0 mL of sterile Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) for 5 min.",
    "In the meantime, prepare 20.0 mL of plating media as follows: to 18.31 mL of BME (Basal Medium Eagle, + Earle's Salts), supplemented with 1.0 mL of heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), add 200 µL of sodium pyruvate (from a 100x stock), 200 µL of glutamine (from a 200 nM stock), and 100 µL of penicillin/streptomycin (from a 200x stock).\nReplace the HBSS in the wells with 1.0 mL of plating media and place the plate in the incubator at 37 °C.\nUsing a Bunsen burner, fire-polish three Pasteur pipettes in decreasing diameters. Holding the pipet with one hand, insert the tip into the flame and quickly remove it. Repeat the process until the tip smoothens and the diameter is reduced to the desired diameter (assessed by eye).\n3. Reagent preparation for Neural Tissue Dissociation, following the directions of the Neural Dissociation kit\nAfter warming the Digestion Buffer 1 at room temperature, prepare Enzyme Mix 1 by mixing 50 µL of Enzyme 1 with 1.91 mL of Buffer 1 and Enzyme Mix 2 by mixing 15 µL of Enzyme 2 with 30 µL of Digestion Buffer 2. The mixes are enough to be used for all embryos' brain tissue.\nPrepare 0.5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) in HBSS, for example, 0.25 g in 50.0 mL of HBSS.\n4. Embryo extraction\nAutoclave two straight fine forceps, one curved point forceps, and one pair of fine surgical scissors and sterilize them with 70% ethanol before use. Then, fill the Petri dishes with HBSS.\nEuthanize one E14-E16 pregnant dam in the CO2 chamber and perform cervical dislocation.\n\tNOTE: The following steps must be performed under the hood under sterile conditions:",
    "Sterilize the abdomen with 70% ethanol. Cut open the abdominal cavity from the pubic symphysis to the xiphoid process of the rib cage with surgical scissors and forceps.\nExtract the uterine horn and place it in a 100 mm plate filled with ice-cold HBSS and wash thoroughly.\nExtract and separate all the embryos from the uterus with fine forceps. Quickly decapitate the embryos with fine surgical scissors and/or forceps. Place the heads in the 60 mm Petri dish filled with HBSS.\n5. Hypothalamus extraction, collection, and tissue dissociation\nPlace one fine forceps in the eye cavity to hold the brain. Using the other fine forceps, remove the skin and the skull by peeling until the brain is visible. Distinguish the brain from other tissues based on its white appearance. Skin and skull are pink and rich in vasculature.\nRemove the brain from the skull by using the curved point forceps and scoop out the brain from the olfactory bulbs, flipping it upside down.\nNow the cortex is ventral, and the hypothalamus is visible dorsally on the superior surface (Figure 1B). With the curved forceps, remove the layer of meninges and blood vessels until the brain appears white and clear.\nWith the curved forceps, separate the hypothalamic area from the rest of the brain.\nCut the hypothalamus into 3-4 small pieces and with a pipet, transfer the pieces into a 15 mL tube.\nRepeat the steps for the other embryos while the tube is on ice.\nFill the tube with 6.0 mL of HBSS and let the tissue settle, remove the supernatant, and add Enzyme Mix 1. Gently mix and agitate the tube to prevent the tissue.\nIncubate the tube in a 37 °C water bath for 15 min and agitate the tissue every 5 min to resuspend the tissue.",
    "After 15 min, add 30 μL of Enzyme mix 2. Dissociate the brain tissue by using the pipette Pasteur with the biggest diameter (<1 mm). Pipet up and down 10x without forming bubbles.\nIncubate for 10 min at 37 °C in the water bath. Gently agitate the tube to resuspend the tissue every 5 min.\nAfter 10 min, add the remaining 15 µL of Enzyme mix 2. Dissociate the tissue 10x with the other two fire-polished pipettes of decreasing diameter, up and down without forming bubbles.\nTo the tube with the dissociated tissue, add immediately 10.0 mL of HBSS-0.5% BSA and centrifuge at 300 × g for 10 min at room temperature.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1.0 mL of HBS-0.5% BSA.\n6. Cell counting\nDilute the cell suspension 1:5 using HBSS-0.5% BSA.\nPlace 10 µL of the diluted cell suspension in a Neubauer counting chamber.\nUnder a brightfield microscope, count only the cells that are in the four chamber's corner squares. Calculate the average and multiply by 5 × 104.\n\t​NOTE: Make sure there are >106 cells to proceed to cell isolation; the optimal cell number is 107.\n7. Negative selection\nNOTE: Negative selection enables users to obtain a pure primary neuron culture by separating neuronal and non-neuronal cells. Use precooled solutions.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 300 × g for 3 min (centrifugation can be extended up to 10 min). Gently aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet to a concentration of 107 cells in 80 µL of HBSS-0.5% BSA.\nAdd 20 µL of Non-Neuronal Cell Biotin-Antibody Cocktail and incubate for 5 min at 4 °C.\nWash the cells to remove free antibody with 2.0 mL of HBSS-0.5% BSA and centrifuge at 300 × g for 3 min.",
    "Gently aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 80 µL of HBSS-0.5% BSA. Add 20 µL of anti-biotin Microbeads, mix thoroughly, and incubate for 10 min at 4 °C.\nAdd 0.5 mL of HBSS-0.5% BSA for up to 107 cells and wait until the magnetic column is ready.\n8. Magnetic separation, negative selection\nNOTE: Magnetic separation is a crucial step that allows the separation of the non-neuronal cells from the neuronal cells. The sample containing neuronal and non-neuronal cells is passed through the magnetic field and the non-neuronal cells, which are bound to a biotin-antibody-magnetic bead complex, are trapped in the column (Figure 1C). The free neuronal cells are eluted through the column and are collected in a 15 mL tube.\nPrepare the stand (included in the kit) with the separator and the MS column as shown in Figure 1C.\nOpen the column and set up the stand only when the cells are ready to be separated.\nRinse the column with 0.5 mL of HBSS-0.5% BSA. Wait until the solution stops dripping.\nTo collect neuronal cells, place a 15 mL tube under the column and pass 0.5 mL of the cell suspension through the column. Collect the eluate in the tube until it stops dripping. To capture residual neuronal cells, wash the column 3 x 0.5 mL of HBSS-0.5% BSA.\nTo collect non-neuronal cells, remove the column from the magnet and place it inside a new 15 ml tube. Add 1.0 mL of HBSS--0.5% BSA to the column and use the plunger to collect the magnetically labeled non-neuronal cells.\nCentrifuge the neuronal and non-neuronal cells at 300 × g for 3 min. Gently aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1.0 mL of HBSS-0.5% BSA. Count the cells as described previously in section 6.",
    "If needed, plate the non-neuronal cells in a 24-well plate; otherwise discard them.\n9. Positive selection\nNOTE: Once a pure neuronal cell suspension is obtained, positive selection is carried out to isolate the targeted cells. Cells can be isolated by using a specific biotin-conjugated antibody for a surface antigen. The antibody is recognized by anti-biotin magnetic beads. By flowing the cell suspension through the column, only the cells of interest are trapped in the magnetic field.\nCentrifuge the pure neuronal cell suspension at 300 × g for 3 min. Gently aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 80 µL of HBSS-0.5% BSA. Add the specific antibody following the manufacturer's instructions and incubate at 4 °C for 10 min.\n\tNOTE: If cells expressing the LepR are sought, we suggest a Mouse Leptin R Biotinylated Antibody (see Table of Materials) at a concentration of 0.50 µg/106 cells.\nWash off the excess antibody with 2.0 mL of HBSS-0.5% BSA and centrifuge at 300 × g for 3 min.\nRemove the supernatant, resuspend the pellet in 80 µL of HBSS-0.5% BSA, and add 20 µL of anti-biotin microbeads. Incubate at 4 °C for 10 min.\nFor every 107 cells, add 0.5 mL of HBSS-0.5% BSA and wait until the magnetic column is ready.\n10. Magnetic separation, positive selection\nPrepare the stand with the separator and the MS column. Rinse the MS column with 0.5 mL of HBSS-0.5% BSA. Wait until the dripping stops.\nPlace a 15 mL tube under the column, pass 0.5 mL of the cell suspension through the column, and collect the eluate comprising the non-specific neuronal cells. To clean the column of residual non-specific neuronal cells, wash with 3 x 0.5 mL of HBSS-0.5% BSA.",
    "Remove the column from the magnet, place it in a new 15 mL tube, and add 1.0 mL of HBSS-0.5% BSA. Use the plunger to flush out the targeted cells.\nCentrifuge both tubes at 300 × g for 3 min. Gently remove the supernatant and resuspend it in 0.5 mL of plating medium.\nCount the cells as previously described in section 6.\nPlate both targeted cells as the positive control and non-specific cells as the negative control at 120,000-200,000 cells/mm3 density in the 24-well plate previously prepared as described in section 2 and incubate at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 9% O2, and 95% humidity for 12 h.\n11. Cell culture maintenance\nPrepare 20 mL of culture medium with 19.2 mL of Neuronal Culture Medium, 400 µL of B27 supplement (from a 50x stock), 200 µL of glutamine (from a 200 µM stock), and 100 µL of penicillin/streptomycin (from a 200x stock).\nReplace plating media from the 24 well-plate containing neuronal or non-neuronal cells.\nWash with 2 x 1.0 mL of HBSS.\nAdd 1.0 mL of culture media.\nRefresh the media every 2/3 days by replacing 0.5 mL of old media with 0.5 mL of fresh media.\n\t​NOTE: Cells can be maintained in culture and used for up to 21 days in vitro (DIV21).\n12. Neuron immunofluorescence staining\nTwelve hours prior to the staining, prepare a solution consisting of 50/50 methanol and acetone and cool it at -20 °C overnight.\nWash the neurons in the 24-well plate with 2 x 1.0 mL of 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 5 min.\nReplace the PBS solution with 1.0 mL of the 50/50 solution and incubate in ice for 20 min.\nWash with 1x PBS for 3 x 5 min.",
    "Block the neurons with 3% BSA in 1x PBS for 1 h at room temperature.\nPrepare the primary antibody solution in 3% BSA in 1x PBS, using the antibody concentration mentioned in the manufacturer's directions. The antibodies and concentrations used are listed in the Table of Materials.\nReplace the blocking solution with the primary antibody solution and incubate at 4 °C overnight.\nWash the cells for 3 x 10 min with 1x PBS.\nPrepare the secondary antibody solution with 3% BSA in 1x PBS, using the concentrations of the antibodies following the manufacturer's instructions. The secondary antibodies used are listed in the Table of Materials.\nIncubate the cells with the secondary antibody solution at room temperature for 1 h.\nWash the cells for 3 x 10 min with 1x PBS.\nLeave the neurons in 1x PBS during the mounting procedure. Place a small drop of mounting medium (with or without 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for nuclear identification) on the microscope slide. Extract one glass coverslip containing neurons with forceps and tap the side of the coverslip on a paper tissue to dry the excess PBS. Flip the coverslip on the mounting medium, making sure the neurons are facing the microscope slides; gently press and remove the excess mounting media with tissue paper.\nThe microscope slides are ready to be analyzed with a brightfield or a confocal microscope."
