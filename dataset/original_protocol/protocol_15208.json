    "1. Patient Preparation\nConsent patient scheduled for diagnostic cystoscopy and other endourological procedures such as transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) for CLE. Include in the consent a description of the use of intravesical and/or intravenous fluorescein as the contrast agent. Inquire history of hypersensitivity reaction to fluorescein.\nPatient is positioned for cystoscopy (typically in lithotomy position) and prepared in a sterile fashion.\nProceed with standard white light cystoscopy (WLC) with a rigid or flexible cystoscope through the urethra.\nSurvey all regions of the bladder under white light (Figure 1) and note regions of interest for CLE investigation.\nIn addition to WLC, the bladder may be imaged with other macroscopic optical imaging modalities including fluorescence cystoscopy (Figure 2A) or narrow band imaging (Figure 2B) to identify additional areas of suspicion followed by characterization with CLE.\nUse a cautery electrode or resection loop to place a small cautery mark adjacent to the regions of interest that will both be imaged and biopsied for pathological confirmation. The cautery mark facilitates re-localization for subsequent CLE imaging and biopsy.\n2. Contrast Agent\nIntravesical instillation of contrast agent\n\t\nPrepare by diluting clinical grade 10% fluorescein sodium in sterile normal saline (0.9% NaCl) to desired concentration. For example, prepare 400 ml of 0.1% fluorescein by diluting 4 ml of 10% fluorescein in 396 ml of normal saline.\nInsert a sterile urinary catheter into the bladder and instill diluted contrast agent by gravity using a 60 ml catheter-tip syringe.\nClamp the urinary catheter to hold contrast agent indwelling for 5 min.\nDrain contrast agent from bladder. Use the 60 ml catheter-tip syringe to wash out residual contrast from the bladder using normal saline, about 240-300 ml.\nProceed to CLE imaging.\nIntravenous injection of fluorescein",
    "Draw 1.0 ml of fluorescein into syringe. Attach syringe to intravenous access and inject 0.5 - 1.0 ml of fluorescein intravenously as a bolus. Flush line with normal saline. This is typically done by the anesthesia team in the operating room.\nProceed to CLE imaging.\n3. CLE Imaging\nRemove the sterilized CLE imaging probe (Cellvizio) from its packaging and connect it to the laser scanning unit (Mauna Kea Technologies, Paris, France)\nWarm up and calibrate the imaging probe by following the manufacturer's instructions.\nRe-insert the cystoscope or resectoscope into the bladder. Use a 0 degree lens with the rigid cystoscope.\nAdvance the CLE imaging probe along the working channel of the cystoscope with the tip just beyond the cystoscope.\nUnder white light, locate the previously marked regions of interest. Use additional normal saline irrigation as needed for visualization of the mucosa and maintain moderate distension of the bladder.\nManipulate CLE imaging probe with the operator's hand for direct en face contact of the regions of interest. For optical sectioning of the regions of interest, gently increase and decrease pressure to the imaging probe while maintaining direct contact.\n\t\nTo reach tumors located at the anterior bladder, a standard Albarran bridge may help facilitate deflection of the imaging probe for direct contact with the region of interest (Figure 2C).\nCommon regions of interest include papillary tumor, non-papillary tumor, transition between normal-appearing mucosa and tumor, and erythematous patches, which can all be imaged using either intravesical or intravenous fluorescein administration. Intravenous fluorescein is required for imaging of the resection bed, prostatic urethra, and penile urethra.\nAs the imaging probe scans region of interest, record images for future analysis. Note overall cellular morphology, boundary, organization, and presence of neo-angiogenesis.\nUpon completion of imaging, remove CLE imaging probe from working channel.",
    "If desired, obtain cold-cup biopsies from corresponding regions of interest that were scanned by CLE. Use cautery markings as landmarks for co-registration of the imaged areas that are biopsied.\nComplete TURBT per routine. In patients who received intravenous fluorescein, consider using continuous flow resectoscopes to improve visualization during resection, as fluorescein is excreted by the kidney into the bladder approximately 5 min after intravenous administration.\nRetrieve saved image recordings from confocal processor and conduct image analysis.\nSubscription Required.
