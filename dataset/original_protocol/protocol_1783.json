    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPrimary mouse cortical neuron culture\nTiming: 4 h\nIn a biosafety cabinet, decapitate postnatal day 0 (P0) mouse pups with surgical scissors and place the head into a 100 mm petri dish filled with ice-cold L-15 medium.\nRemove the scalp and immerse the brain in a new petri dish containing cold L-15 medium using forceps. The plate containing the brain is placed on ice and stored until cortical neurons are obtained.\nUsing a stereomicroscope, remove the meninges with forceps, remove the cortices, and transfer them to a 15 mL conical tube. Usually, up to 2 brains are placed in one 15 mL conical tube and kept cold on ice.\nSterilize the 15 mL conical tube containing the cortices with 70% ethanol and transfer to the biosafety cabinet. Carefully remove the L-15 medium using a pipette, add 300–400 μL of pre-warmed 0.25% trypsin, and incubate at 37°C for 10 min.\nCritical: Never exceed 12 min for 0.25% trypsin incubation at 37°C. Extended incubations decrease the survival rate of neurons.\nAfter incubation, re-sterilize the conical tube with 70% ethanol and put back into the biosafety cabinet. Tilt the conical tube and carefully remove trypsin with a pipette, and fill with 1 mL of pre-warmed high-glucose complete DMEM.\nMechanically dissociate cortical tissue to individual cells using a pipette.\nCritical: Trypsin treatment for 10 min digests various extracellular matrix proteins allowing easy mechanical dissociation. However, neurons are weakened and can die quickly. To increase the survival rate of neurons, resuspend cells by pipetting up and down with a 1 mL tip placed close to the bottom of the conical tube. Pipetting should be done gently and carefully, never performing more than 10 repetitions.",
    "After adding 4 mL of high-glucose complete DMEM, filter it using a 40 μm nylon cell strainer into a 50 mL conical tube.\nTransfer 10 μL of solution from a 50 mL conical tube to an Eppendorf tube and add 10 ul of trypan blue solution. Count live cells using a hemocytometer and calculate the number of cells per mL in a 50 mL conical tube.\nSeed 1.333 × 105 cells/cm2 on the PDL-coated coverslip. Fill each well of a 12-well plate with up to 1 mL of the high-glucose medium.\nCritical: The 4 wells in the corners of the 12 well plate are filled with autoclaved distilled water to mitigate evaporation of the medium. Troubleshooting, problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nTransfer the 12-well plate to the incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2 and wait for 2 h for neuronal precursor cells to settle on the PDL-coated coverslip.\nAfter 2 h, the adhesion of the precursors to the coverslip is checked using an epi-illumination microscope. Carefully remove high-glucose complete DMEM at the biosafety cabinet and replace with 1 mL of pre-warmed complete neurobasal medium. Troubleshooting, problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\nMaintain the prepared cortical neuronal culture in the incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 21 days.\nMaintenance of primary cortical neuron culture\nTiming: 15–30 min, every 3 or 4 days until DIV 21\nReplace the complete neurobasal medium twice a week.\nSEP-DAGLα transfection into primary cultured cortical neurons\nTiming: 5 h\nPrepare the solutions for transfection in advance.\nTransfection neurobasal medium (B27 supplement 1× + GlutaMax 1×)\nH-DMEM (HEPES pH7.2–7.6 added to a final concentration 10 mM in DMEM)\nLipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent\npEZ-3xFlag-SEP-DAGLα plasmid and pmCherry-C1 plasmid\n12-well plates filled with 400 μL of transfection neurobasal medium and placed into the incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.",
    "Critical: Transfection media must be free of antibiotics to prevent neuronal cell death.\nPrepare two different Eppendorf tubes in the biosafety cabinet. Prepare 50 μL per sample of h-DMEM in 1 tube and transfection neurobasal medium in the other tube. Mix 2 μg total of plasmids (ex. 1 μg of SEP-DAGLα + 1 μg of mCherry) in transfection neurobasal medium, and 2 μL per sample of lipofectamine 2000 in the other h-DMEM.\nAfter mixing the h-DMEM solution with transfection neurobasal medium through pipetting, incubate for 20–30 min at 37°C.\nWhile waiting for 20 min, transfer the coverslips to a 12-well plate filled with 400 μL of pre-warmed transfection neurobasal medium using autoclaved fine forceps.\nCritical: The 12-well plate and medium used for maintenance of the neuronal cells put back into the incubator. After transfection, the coverslips will be returned to the original 12-well plate.\nAfter incubation for 20–30 min, treat 100 μL of transfection solution on each coverslip drop by drop using a 200 μL tip and place in an incubator for 4 h.\nAfter 4 h, return the coverslip to the original 12-well plate using autoclaved fine forceps and place it in the incubator.\nIncubate dishes in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2 for ∼48 h to allow time for adequate fluorescent protein expression.\nCritical: In the case of mouse cortical primary cultured neurons, the transfection efficiency was 0.03% under optimal conditions.\nLive time-lapse imaging with a confocal microscope\nTiming: 4 h\nTwo days after transfection, combine the coverslip with a quick-release imaging chamber (QR-48LP) and securely mount the chamber onto the environmental chamber stage as described above.\nThe entire area is searched by 20× magnification, and the positions of the transfected pyramidal neurons are saved through X/Y coordinate demarcation.",
    "Critical: To ensure experimental reproducibility, only healthy pyramidal neurons are considered, and subjects with abnormal morphology or weak fluorescence intensity are excluded (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). Troubleshooting, problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7].\nSwitch to the 60× 1.40 NA objective lens and adjust focus. Navigate designated neurons by the ND Acquisition tab and XY sub-tab (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1372-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Representative live images of a healthy neuron (left) and an unhealthy neuron (center)\nA healthy neuron that weakly expresses SEP-DAGLα (right) is also shown. Scale bar, 50 μm.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1372-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. A step-by-step flowchart for FRAP analysis\n(A) mCherry intensity for each layer in a dendritic shaft.\n(B) Set the confocal microscope for imaging and FRAP.\n(C) Schedule and region of interest for FRAP. Scale bar, 5 μm.\nAdjust the pinhole to 1.2 airy units.\nSelect a pixel size as X = 0.17 μm, Y = 0.17 μm for the 60× 1.40 NA lens, and a scan area of 256 pixels × 256 pixels.\nTo identify the strongest signal Z-plane that can be detected in the dendrite, 7 images over a 1.5 μm section were taken at 0.25 μm intervals. 4 images corresponding to the 1.0 μm section were chosen based on fluorescence intensity for measurement (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A).\nAdjust the laser power to 8 μW, photomultiplier tube (PMT) gain (110 for 488 nm laser and 120 for 561 nm laser; named as HV by the software), and offset (0) for each channel to achieve optimal signal-to-noise (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B).\nUse scan mode to adjust the field of view, centering on the secondary branches of apical neuronal dendrites.\nTake images of mCherry and SEP-DAGLα in dendrites with 2 channels (488 and 561 nm) at the same time before bleaching. mCherry intensity is used for the normalization of SEP-DAGLα intensity.",
    "Two min after the image is taken, a 488 nm wavelength laser is used to bleach the SEP signal in the dendritic shaft, centered on a single z-section with the strongest SEP-DAGLα intensity (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]C).\nWith ND stimulation menu, set the region of interest (12 μm (width) × 8 μm (height)). Troubleshooting, problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9].\nTo bleach the SEP signal, the center of the dendrite is stimulated for 5 s with 820 μW laser power (488 nm wavelength). This condition was confirmed by a previous experiment with HEK293T cells.\nImmediately after photobleaching, record 7 images-Z-stacks with 2 channels (488 and 561 nm) at 0.25 μm intervals, every 30 s, 21 times for 10 min. Based on HEK293T FRAP recovery times, a 10 min imaging period was performed.\nAnalyze FRAP by GraphPad Prism 9 from the recorded information. Detail methods are described in Quantification and statistical analysis."
