    "The research was performed in compliance with institutional guidelines. All equipment and reagents must be autoclaved or sterilized with 70% ethanol or UV light.\n1. Egg incubation\nStore fertilized quail eggs at 10-15 °C for a maximum of 4-5 days before starting incubation. Use only clean and undamaged eggs.\nIncubate the eggs in a forced draught incubator for ~ 53-54 h. Lay the eggs horizontally with the egg rotation switched off, at 50%-60% humidity and 37.5 °C incubation temperature.\n2. Ex ovo culture preparation\nNOTE: After initial incubation, the eggs are suitable for starting the ex ovo cultivation.\nDisinfect the egg surface with 70% ethanol, without rotating the egg.\nIn a sterile laminar-flow cabinet, open the eggshell using small sterile surgical scissors and transfer the contents into a 6-well culture plate. If properly done, the embryo will lie on top of an undamaged yolk. After each egg, disinfect the scissors with 70% ethanol.\nAdd approximately 5 mL of sterile water to the gaps in the 6-well plate, as humidity is essential to prevent the CAM from drying out.\nPlace the embryos in an incubator until further experiments, while maintaining a temperature of 37 °C and 80%-90% humidity.\nWhen the CAM is fully developed (from ED7), place a sterilized silicone ring (6 mm in diameter and approximately 1.5 mm in thickness) on the CAM surface, along the small capillaries. Avoid major blood vessels when placing the ring.\n\tNOTE: The ring defines the workspace, helps mark the place of substance application, and prevents the liquid contents from leaking out.\nTerminate the cultivation of the embryos according to the country's legislation.\nImportantly, wear gloves or keep hands disinfected with 70% ethanol during work. Aspirate improperly tipped embryos or unfertilized eggs with a vacuum aspirator.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63422/63422fig01.jpg",

Inoculation of tumor cells\nNOTE: All procedures require the use of a sterile laminar flow cabinet.\nCulture different types of adherent cells in flasks according to respective culture protocols.\n\t\nRemove the old medium from the flasks and rinse the cell layer with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove traces of the medium.\nAfter trypsinization, inhibit the trypsin by adding the culture medium and harvest the cells into centrifuge tubes. Centrifuge the cells and resuspend the cell pellet in a fresh culture medium. Count the cells and resuspend them in a cell culture medium at the desired concentration.\n\t\tNOTE: It is also possible to produce 3D cell cultures, i.e., spheroids using, for example, the hanging drop method21.\nImplant 1 x 105-1 x 106 tumor cells or 5-15 spheroids (per CAM) in 30 µL of cell medium solution into the silicone ring on top of the CAM.",
    "NOTE: The volume depends on the size of the silicone ring used. If a silicone ring with a larger diameter is used, a larger volume is needed to cover the entire area. Depending on the cell type, or for different types of experiments, various cell concentrations may be used. Sometimes, fine scraping of CAM is used to improve the adhesion of the embedded cells.\nReturn the CAMs with inoculated cells to the incubator (37 °C and 80%-90% humidity).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63422/63422fig03.jpg\nFigure 3: Inoculation of CAM with tumors.

Application of photosensitizer\nApplication of hypericin\n\t\nUnder dim lighting, prepare a 2 mM stock solution of hypericin by dissolving it in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Prepare a 79 µM working solution of hypericin shortly before the experiment with sterile PBS or saline solution. Ensure the final concentration of DMSO in all solutions is always under 0.2%, which does not affect the development of the embryo.\nUnder sterile conditions, apply an appropriate volume of hypericin solution to the silicone ring. A volume of 30 µL is sufficient to fill a ring with a diameter of 6 mm.\nKeep embryos in an incubator at 37 °C and 80%-90% humidity. Hypericin in an aqueous solution is photoactive after its monomerization in the tissue, approximately 3 h after its application on the CAM.\nApplication of hypericin with LDL, HDL, or nanoparticles as transport systems\n\tNOTE: These transport systems are used to improve the penetration of hypericin into cells and cell structures.\n\t\nDue to the photosensitivity, perform all the steps, including the preparation of solutions, under dim lighting and store the solutions in the dark.",
    "Prepare the hypericin-LDL and hypericin-HDL formulations by mixing appropriate volumes of lipoproteins and hypericin stock solutions in PBS according to reference15. The concentration of LDL or HDL to hypericin is 20:115.\nSynthesize polymer nanoparticles by living cationic ring-opening polymerization according to references12,13. Adjust the concentration of hypericin in polymer nanoparticles with PBS to 10 μM12,13.\n5. PDD and PDT\nConduct PDD\n\t\nUnder sterile conditions, apply photosensitizer (hypericin, hypericin-loaded polymeric nanoparticles, or hypericin with lipoprotein carrier) on the CAM surface, with or without tumor cells (ED 7-9).\nIlluminate the CAM using violet excitation light (custom-made circular LED light of 405 nm wavelength) and record the fluorescence of hypericin in CAM tissue and tumor cells with a digital camera at time intervals of 0, 1, 3, 5, 24, and 48 h after hypericin administration.\nIf the research requires an image of the CAM in white light, record the CAM before hypericin administration and at the end of the experiment, shortly before the tissue fixation, as the light affects the photoactivation of hypericin.\nEvaluate the fluorescence intensity using an image processing and analysis program (e.g., ImageJ22).\n\t\t\nSplit RGB image channels into separate red, green, and blue images. Analyze the red intensity image in 8-bit form. Evaluate the red intensity from the area inside the ring and approximate it as the hypericin fluorescence. Obtain whole image profile plots (using ImageJ's Profile Plot plugin) at different time intervals after hypericin administration (i.e., from 0 h, right after administration, up to 48 h).\nConduct PDT\n\t\nPerform the PDT at least 3 h after hypericin application.\nPlace the optical fiber above the surface of the CAM for the laser ray to cover the entire area within the silicone ring.",
    "Perform in vivo irradiation (1-2 min) with a 405 nm laser light at a fluence rate of 285 mW/cm2.\nRecord CAM using white light and 405 nm fluorescent light before and after photodynamic treatment (24 h and 48 h).\nDetect photodamage 24 h and 48 h after PDT from the images taken in white light. Evaluate vascular damage by a semiquantitative score16: 1 - no destruction; 2 - partial closure of capillaries (diameter ≤10 µm) with no destruction of medium or larger (diameter ≥50 µm) and smaller vessels (diameter 10-50 µm); 3 - partial closure of smaller vessels with capillaries vanishing; 4 - partial closure of larger vessels with smaller vessels and capillaries vanishing; and 5 - total photo thrombosis with most of the vessels vanishing.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63422/63422fig04.jpg\nFigure 4: Treatment of CAM with laser light.

Preparing CAM for further evaluation\nParaffin embedding\n\t\nFix the CAM tissue in a cultivation plate with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for a minimum of 2 h and a maximum of overnight.\nRemove the PFA and carefully cut out from the CAM a part of the tissue within the silicone ring.\nImmediately dehydrate the CAM tissue in ascending alcohol series as follows. Place the CAM tissue in 70% ethanol for 3 min, eosin solution for 2 min (for easier location of the tissue in the paraffin block), 96% ethanol for 3 x 5 min (always in a new Petri dish), and 100% ethanol for 5 min and xylene for 2 x 10 min.",
    "Using a spatula or thin brush, transfer the samples as quickly as possible to the dissolved paraffin in Petri dishes (59 °C). After 24 h, place the tissue in histological mold, fill it with paraffin embedding medium, and allow it to solidify in the refrigerator. Cut the solidified CAM from the embedding medium, turn it in the tray by 90°, fill it again with the embedding medium, and let it solidify.\nPrepare 5-10 µm sections on a microtome for histopathological analysis to determine PDT-induced damage.\nPreparation of frozen CAM sections for histology\n\tNOTE: For some methodologies including histology, frozen sections prepared on cryostat microtome are more suitable. Follow the below steps for preparing the frozen CAM sections.\n\t\nCarefully mount native or 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed CAM on the glass slide.\nFill embedding mold to half with optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT) and freeze in liquid nitrogen or a mixture of dry ice and ethanol.\nAfter freezing, carefully tilt and slide the CAM from the glass slide onto the top of the frozen OCT medium. Place again in the mold, cover with OCT medium, and freeze as in Step 6.2.2.\nFractal analysis of quail CAM\n\tNOTE: Vasculature changes caused by PDT can be assessed by calculating the fractal dimension coefficient19.\n\t\nIn the laminar flow cabinet, overflow CAM in a cultivation plate with a pre-warmed (37 °C) fixation solution of 4% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS.\nRemove the fixation solution after 48 h. Carefully separate the CAM from the embryo with micro-scissors and a fine brush and wash it in PBS.\nMount the washed CAM on a glass slide and let it slowly dry.\nPhotograph the slide using a digital camera and a transilluminator as a source of homogenous white light.",
    "Process digital images using ImageJ software22. For the analysis, select a square region (512 × 512 pixels) from the area with distal arterial branches. Binarize and skeletonize the images and calculate the fractal dimension coefficient (Df) following the procedures described in reference31.\nMolecular analysis of CAM tissue\n\t\nFor molecular analysis, carefully separate native CAM, freeze in liquid nitrogen, and store at -80 °C.\nDetermine gene expression according to standard protocols for RNA isolation23, reverse transcription into cDNA, and quantitative PCR24.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63422/63422fig05.jpg\nFigure 5: CAM tissue for fractal analysis. After PDT, CAM is fixed, mounted on a slide, and dried for fractal analysis. The picture was taken in white light using a transilluminator.
