    "NOTE: All procedures comply with the NIH Guide for the Use and Care of Laboratory Animals. The animal protocol was approved by the IACUC at Weill Cornell Medical College.\n1. Tissue Preparation\nEuthanize timed-pregnancy females by cervical dislocation15. Dissect embryonic E16 - E18 embryos from timed-pregnancy females and place embryos individually in the wells of a 6-well dish, filled with cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\nRinse embryos in cold PBS.\nRemove a small portion of the amniotic membrane of the embryo and place in a pre-prepared proteinase K solution for subsequent genotyping. Alternatively, if the amniotic membrane is lost, remove a small portion of the tip of the embryo tail and place it in proteinase K solution\nPoke holes into the skin all around the embryo using insect pins (at least 100 per side).\nRemove PBS and slowly add fresh 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA), pH 7.4, to the well.\nGently shake for 2 hr at 4 °C.\nRinse embryos twice in PBS and store in PBS at 4 °C until staining.\n2. Genotyping\nImmerse amniotic membranes or embryo tails in proteinase K mixture according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nIncubate at 56 °C for 10 min.\nExtract DNA using a commercially available DNA purification kit.\nTake 0.5 µl of the total 200 µl purified genomic DNA solution, combine it with 0.5 µl of each of the gene-specific sense and antisense primers (10 µM), 2 µl dNTP Mix (2.5 mM of dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP), 0.2 µl Taq polymerase (5 U/µl) and 2 µl PCR buffer (10x), add H2O to a total volume of 20 µl.\n\tNOTE: Primer sequences are as follows (Table 1):\nTrkA: TrkA_F: GCG GGC GCC GCC GCG ATG, TrkA_R: GAA GCC GCC TGC GCG GCT CTG CCA GGG TG; PCR fragment length: 400 basepairs (bp).",
    "Bax: In5R: GTT GAC CAG AGT GGC GTA GG, Ex5F: TGA TCA GAA CCA TCA TG, NeoR: CCG CTT CCA TTG CTC AGC GG; PCR fragment lengths: wild type, 304 bp; Bax null, 507 bp.\nTauLacZ: lacZup: ACA ACG TCG TGA GTG GGA AAA, lacZdown: ATC AAC ATT AAA TGT GAG CGA G; PCR fragment length: 360 bp.\nRun a PCR with the following program for TrkA: step 1: 1 min at 95 °C, step 2: 10 sec at 95 °C, step 3: 20 sec at 68 °C, step 4: 30 sec at 72 °C. Repeat steps 2 - 4 for 40 cycles.\n\t\nFor LacZ and Bax, run a PCR with the following program: step 1: 1 min at 95 °C, step 2: 10 sec at 95 °C, step 3: 1 min at 54 °C, step 4: 1 min at 72 °C, repeat steps 2 - 4 for 35 cycles.\nRun PCR samples on a 2% agarose gel at 100 V in 1x Tris-Acetate-EDTA buffer for 20 min with a lane of DNA ladder to assess fragment lengths.\nAnalyze embryos for the presence of wild type TrkA, TrkA-tauLacZ and Bax null alleles. The genotypes of experimental embryos are TrkAtaulacZ/WT : Bax -/- and TrkAtaulacZ/taulacZ : Bax-/-, depending on the experimental questions. Embryos lacking the tauLacZ reporter will be negative for axonal staining and can therefore serve as negative controls to calibrate the staining process.\n3. Embryo Staining\nUse a commercial kit for lacZ staining with some modifications as described below in sections 3.2 - 3.8. Here, use the Millipore kit.\nImmerse embryos in Buffer A for at least 1 hr, shaking gently at room temperature.\nDirectly immerse embryos in Buffer B for at least 15 min, shaking gently at room temperature.",
    "While embryos are in Buffer A/B, pre-warm Tissue Base solution at 37 °C. Use 5 ml of Tissue Base solution per embryo.\nWhile embryos are in Buffer A/B, prepare fresh 5-bromo-​4-​chloro-​3-​indolyl α-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal) at a concentration of 40 mg/ml in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).\nDilute X-gal into the pre-warmed Tissue Base solution at a concentration of 1 mg/ml and add 5 ml of X-gal/Tissue Base mixture to a glass scintillation vial.\nTransfer embryos to a glass scintillation vial containing X-gal/Tissue Base mixture. Seal lid with Parafilm and incubate at 37 °C overnight, checking for presence of blue stain.\nPostfix embryos with fresh 4% PFA, pH 7.4. Gently shake for 4 hr at 4 °C.\nRinse embryos twice in cold PBS.\n4. Tissue Dehydration and Clearing\nPlace embryos in 50% methanol/ 50% PBS mixture for 30 min at room temperature, shaking in the glass vials.\nContinue to dehydrate in 75% methanol/ 25% PBS for 30 min at room temperature, shaking in glass vials.\nContinue to dehydrate in 90% methanol/ 10% PBS for 30 min at room temperature, shaking in glass vials.\nContinue to dehydrate in 100% methanol for 30 min (2x) at room temperature, shaking in glass vials.\nWhile embryos are dehydrating, prepare a 1:1 (v:v) mixture of benzoyl alcohol and benzoyl benzoate.\n\tNOTE: Benzoyl alcohol and benzoyl benzoate is toxic.\nImmerse embryos in the 1:1 (v:v) mixture of 100% methanol: 100% BABB for 15 min. Only use glass because the BABB will dissolve plastic.\nImmerse embryos in 100% BABB to completely clear the tissue and to visualize X-gal staining in the cleared embryo.\n\tNOTE: Image as soon as possible because the X-gal stain will fade over time.\n5. Whole Mount Imaging",
    "Stabilize the embryo, immersed in 100% BABB, at the appropriate angles for photography using metal forceps. Illuminate using a combination of up-light and under-light light sources.\nAcquire images with a dissecting microscope outfitted with a digital camera. Take multiple bright field exposures at five successive focal planes 0.5 mm apart along the Z axis. Exposure times and f-stops may vary according to illumination and camera specs and need to be optimized for each setup.\nUse standard image processing software to process overlay images and generate photomontages.\nSubscription Required.
