    "This protocol was approved by the local ethical committee. All the participants and their parents signed an informed consent form for this experiment.\n1. Subjects\nOnly include 15 healthy male adolescent subjects, whose age ranges from 14 to 22 years (mean ± standard deviation: 18.3 ± 2.8 years).\n\tNOTE: The current protocol to analyze the microstate and omega complexity has been developed for healthy subjects, but is not restricted to this group only.\n2. EEG data recording\nAsk subjects to sit on a comfortable chair in a silent, temperature-controlled room, where the EEG data was recorded. Collect the 20-channel EEG data using the ANT EEG system in this protocol.\nPut the cap on the subjects' head.\n\t\nIn this study, use a cap with medium size, since it was suitable for most adolescent or male subjects. For children, please measure the head circumference of each subject, and determine the cap with suitable size.\nPlace the electrode Cz at approximately 50% of the distance between inion and nasion and 50% of the distance between the left and right inter-aural indentations. Place the reference electrodes on the left and right mastoid bone, respectively. Place the other scalp electrodes at the standard locations according to the international 10-20 system.\n\t\tNOTE: An electrode system and EEG amplifier with 20 channels is sufficient for EEG microstate analysis and omega complexity analysis.\nFill all the electrodes with conductive gel by inserting a blunt needle through the electrodes. Use the conductive gel to lower the impedance. Keep all electrode impedances lower than 10 kiloohms (kΩ).\n\t\nDuring this period, provide some entertainment for the subjects (e.g., show a short film). If a dry electrode or a saline electrode is used, skip the step of injecting conductive gel.",
    "Instruct the subjects to relax with eyes closed during the recording, which lasts 5 min. Use the digitization software to digitize and record the EEG signal. Use a sampling rate of at least 250 samples/s. Use an online filter broader than 0.1 and 80 Hz.\n\tNOTE: Although most commercial available electrode-amplifier systems use an active electrode system, which could improve the signal to noise ratio of EEG signal, do not place this system close to any electrical devices during EEG recording.\n3. EEG Data Preprocessing\nNOTE: EEG data could be preprocessed using various open source or commercial software. The instructions provided below are specific for EEGLAB. This is only one out of many available options to preprocess EEG data.\nImport the raw EEG data to the EEG software (e.g., EEGLAB) (File | Import data | Using EEGLAB functions and plugins).\n\tNOTE: The raw EEG data recorded from various electrode-amplifier systems could be recognized by EEGLAB, such as EGI, ANT, Brain Vision recorder, and Neuroscan.\nLoad the channel location file into the EEG software (Edit | Channel locations). Although the EEG data and the channel names have been imported to EEGLAB, import a channel location file into the EEG software in order to obtain the spatial locations of these electrodes.\nRemove the reference electrodes (Edit | Select data| Select data in channel range). In the option of \"Select data in channel range\" of the pop-up dialogue box, select only the recording electrodes and do not select the reference electrodes so that the reference electrodes can be removed. The data recorded in reference electrodes is not 'true' brain signal, since these two electrodes are placed on the left and right mastoid bone respectively.",
    "Band pass filter the EEG data between 0.5 and 80 Hz (Tools | Filter the data | Basic FIR filter [new, default]). In the pop-up dialogue box, choose 5 for the \"Lower edge of the frequency pass band (Hz)\", and choose 80 for the \"Higher edge of the frequency pass band (Hz)\". Then click the button of \"Ok\".\nRemove the power line noise with a notch filter between 49 and 51 Hz (Tools | Filter the data | Basic FIR filter [new, default]). In the pop-up dialogue box, choose 49 for the \"Lower edge of the frequency pass band (Hz)\", and choose 51 for the \"Higher edge of the frequency pass band (Hz)\", and select the option of \"Notch filter the data instead of pass band\". Then click the button of \"Ok\".\nCorrect the data portions contaminated by eye movements, electromyography (EMG) or any other non-physiological artifacts using the Blind Source Separation (BSS) algorithm15. For eye movements, click on Tools | Artifact removal using AAR 1.3 | EOG removal | Using BSS; for EMG, Tools | Artifact removal using AAR 1.3 | EMG removal using BSS.\nSegment the pre-processed continuous EEG data into epochs, with epoch length of 2 s. To do this, write 'EEG = eeg_regepochs(EEG, 'recurrence', 2, 'limits',[0 2],'rmbase' ,NaN); pop_saveset(EEG)', then hit the Enter key of the keyboard. A window will pop up that allows the saving of the segmented EEG data.\nImport the segmented EEG data to the EEG software (File | Load existing dataset).\nReject EEG epochs with amplitude values exceeding ± 80 µV at any electrode (Tools | Reject data epochs | Reject data [all methods]).\nSave the preprocessed EEG data (File | Save current dataset as).\n4. EEG Microstate Analysis",
    "NOTE: A modified version of the classical K-means clustering algorithm is used for microstate class analysis16, which contains a bottom-up procedure and an up-bottom procedure. In the bottom-up procedure, the group-level microstate classes are identified using the spatial correlation as a clustering criterion. Then in the up-bottom procedure, each topographical map of each subject in each group is assigned to the EEG microstate class with maximum spatial correlation. For resting-state EEG microstate analysis, the polarity of topographical maps is commonly disregarded. EEG microstate class analysis could be done using various open source softwares, such as CARTOOL, sLORETA, EMMA and MapWin. The instructions provided below are specific for the EEGLAB plugin for Microstates. This EEGLAB plugin could be downloaded from https://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/EEGLAB_Extensions_and_plug-ins.\nFor each subject, load the preprocessed EEG data (File | Load existing dataset), convert reference channels to common average reference (Tools | Re-reference), and band pass filter the EEG data between 2 and 20 Hz (Tools | Filter the data | Basic FIR filter [new, default]).\nIdentify the four microstate maps in each subject (Tools | Microstates | identify microstate maps). In the pop-up dialogue box, choose 3 for the \"Min number of classes\", choose 6 for the \"Max number of classes\", choose 50 for the \"number of restarts\", choose \"Max number of maps to use\", and select the options of \"GFP peak only\" and \"No polarity\". Then click the button of \"Ok\".\nSave the EEG data of each subject after identifying its own microstate maps (File | Save current dataset as).\nImport the EEG datasets of all the subjects saved in the last step at once (File | Load existing dataset).",
    "Identify the group-level microstate maps (Tools | Microstates | Average microstate maps across datasets). In the pop-up dialogue box, select the datasets of all subjects in the option \"Choose sets for averaging\". In the option \"Name of mean\", give a name for the group-level microstate maps. The default name is \"GrandMean\". Then click the button of \"Ok\". This will create a new data set named as \"GrandMean\", which stores the group-level microstate maps.\nManually sort the order of four group-level microstate maps according to their classic order (Plot | Edit microstate maps). In the pop-up, select \"More\", and then the number of maps shown becomes four. Select \"Man. sort\". In the pop-up dialogue box, enter the new order of four group-level microstate maps. Then click \"Close\".\nSort the order of the four microstate maps of each subject (Tools | Microstates | Sort individual microstate maps according to mean).\nSave the microstate parameters of each subject (Tools | Microstates | Quantify microstates in dataset [mean template maps]), which will invoke two pop-up dialogue boxes sequentially.\n\t\nIn the first dialogue box, select the data sets of all subjects. In the second dialogue box, select \"4 Classes\" for option \"Number of Classes\", select the options of \"Fitting only on GFP peaks\" and \"Remove potentially truncated microstates\", choose 30 for the \"Label smoothing window (ms)\" and choose 1 for the \"Non smoothness penalty\". Then click \"Ok\". A csv file which stores the microstate parameters will be saved on the computer.\n5. Omega Complexity Analysis\nSave the EEG data of each epoch and each subject in ASCII or txt format using customized script.An example of the customized script for step 5.1 could be found in the Supplementary Materials.",
    "NOTE: If the global omega complexity is computed, the EEG data of all the scalp electrodes are needed to export in ASCII or txt format. If the regional omega complexity is computed, export only the EEG data of electrodes in that scalp region. For example, in order to compute anterior omega complexity, export only the EEG data of electrodes in anterior region (i.e., Fp1, Fp2, F7, F3, Fz, F4 and F8); in order to compute posterior omega complexity, export only the EEG data of electrodes in posterior region (i.e., T5, T6, P3, P4, Pz, O1 and O2).\nCompute the omega complexity of all discrete frequencies using the sLORETA software17 (Utilities | Global connectivity). This software is available at http://www.uzh.ch/keyinst/loreta.htm.\nCompute the omega complexity of each frequency band using customized script26. In our case, compute the omega complexity of the following eight frequency bands as the mean value within each frequency limit, which are delta (0.5-3.5 Hz), theta (4-7.5 Hz), alpha1 (8-10 Hz), alpha2 (10.5-13.5 Hz), beta1 (14-18 Hz), beta2 (18.5-30 Hz), gamma1 (30.5-48 Hz), and gamma2 (52-80 Hz)4. An example of the customized script for step 5.3 could be found in the Supplementary Materials.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
