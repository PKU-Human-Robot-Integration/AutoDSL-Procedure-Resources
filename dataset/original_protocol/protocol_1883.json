    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPart 1: Generation of mice exposed to antibiotics in early life\nTiming: ∼6 weeks\nThis mouse model of early life antibiotic exposure involves administration of two antibiotics, ampicillin and neomycin, via the drinking water to dams in late pregnancy and during the pre-weaning period. A comparable group of control mice not exposed to antibiotics should also be maintained.\nSet up timed-mating.\nCo-house females (aged 8–12 weeks), 5 females to a cage for 2 weeks in advance of mating.\nPlace dirty bedding from studs’ cages into the female cages ∼3 days in advance of mating to induce a synchronized estrous cycle. We suggest adding 75–100 mL of urine soaked bedding into each of the female cages.\nWeigh each mouse individually prior to timed mating.\nPlace 1–2 females in each studs’ cage.\nCheck females for vaginal plugs every morning for the duration of the timed mating. Remove plugged females from the stud cages upon observation of plug, randomly co-house 5 plugged females to a cage.\nRecord date of plugging for each female.\nNote: The “plug” is comprised of coagulated secretions from the male. It tends to fill the female’s vagina and may persist for 8–24 h after breeding. Lift the base of the female’s tail and inspect for a whitish mass in her vaginal opening.\nNote: We usually add the dirty bedding before the weekend and place the females into the studs’ cages on a Tuesday afternoon and check for vaginal plugs every morning for 3 consecutive days; Wednesday, Thursday and Friday morning. We find the majority of C57BL/6J females are plugged on day 1 or day 3 of timed-mating, with only a small portion plugging on day 2 of the timed-mating.",
    "Note: Any unplugged females should be separated from the males after 3 days of attempted mating and placed into cages of 5 females/cage. Mice should be rested prior to reuse for 4–6 weeks. It is possible that a small proportion of these females may become pregnant, though they may be unsuitable for use as the date of plugging will not be known.\nCo-house plugged dams 5 mice to a cage until day 14 of pregnancy (or 14 days post-plugging).\nCollect fecal samples.\nCollect fecal samples from dams in both groups at day 14 of pregnancy (prior to antibiotic exposure) and at day 2 and day 21 post birth of pups.\nTo do this, place each pregnant dam individually onto a clean cage base where she will spontaneously defecate.\nPick up the fecal sample using a sterile toothpick/tip and place into a pre-labeled 2 mL sterile microcentrifuge tube. Place collected sample directly onto dry ice.\nReplace pregnant dam into cage. Clean the cage base and gloved hands with an appropriate reagent (i.e., 70% ethanol/F10) to sterilize.\nNote: A light scruff will encourage any mouse not spontaneously defecating to do so.\nNote: Two or more fecal samples should be collected for each individual mouse.\nCritical: Fecal samples must be placed on dry ice immediately to preserve the integrity of the sample.\nRe-weigh plugged dams at day 14 of pregnancy.\nAssess pregnancy based on increase of 3–5 g of weight and whether mice are visibly pregnant.\nNote: The authors have only carried out this protocol using virgin females, 8–12 weeks of age. Within this window, the authors have found that pregnant dams put on 3–5 g of weight by day 14 of pregnancy, independent of starting weight.",
    "Note: A visibly pregnant dam will develop a “pear-like” appearance with a bulge in their center and enlarged nipples. The size of the bulge will be dependent on the number of fetuses that are being carried.\nRe-house pregnant females, 1 dam per cage, at day 14 of pregnancy based on the plugging date recorded for each dam.\nRandomly assign pregnant dams to antibiotic exposure or control groups.\nPrepare a 1× dilution of ampicillin and neomycin from the pre-made stock solutions.\nThaw out an adequate number of aliquots of the 100× frozen stock solutions before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]: step 1 (3 mL of 100× ampicillin and 3 mL of 100× neomycin are needed for each treated cage).\nPrepare a 1× stock in a sterile water bottle by mixing 3 mL of 100× ampicillin stock and 3 mL of 100× neomycin stock in 300 mL of sterile drinking water (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) (enough for a single cage for 3 days). Replace lid and shake to mix.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1476-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic of sterile antibiotic drinking preparation\nPlace laminated “Antibiotic treatment” label on water bottle.\nPlace antibiotic treated water into position on mouse’s cage.\nUntreated mice receive untreated water.\nCritical: Use sterilized drinking water for stock and diluent.\nNote: Drinking water supplemented with certain antibiotics may taste bitter to mice, and they may be reluctant to drink it, although this was not the case with the antibiotics used in this protocol. If mice are reluctant to drink antibiotic supplemented water, we recommend supplementing the water with sucrose. Importantly, if this is done, sucrose should also be added to the drinking water of the control mice to avoid this being a confounder.",
    "Note: Monitor drinking water levels to ensure that both antibiotic-treated and untreated mice are drinking adequate volumes of water. Consider marking water level on outside of drinking bottle or weighing water bottles on a daily basis.\nNote: Antibiotic supplemented drinking water bottles may be tinted, laminated or wrapped in aluminum foil or equivalent to prevent light damage if using light sensitive antibiotics.\nNote: Replace antibiotic supplemented drinking water every 3 days for the duration of exposure.\nAlternatives: Even in the presence of a sweetener mice may be reluctant to drink water supplemented with certain antibiotics. If this is the case a possible alternative strategy would be to administer antibiotics via oral gavage on a daily basis to achieve similar results (Reikvam et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]). However, daily oral gavage may cause unnecessary stress to pregnant and lactating dams.\nRecord date of birth for pups.\nRecord date of birth and number of pups born to each dam.\nNote: C57BL/6J pups are born to dams approximately 19.5 days post plugging. Time from plugging to birth may vary from mouse strain to strain.\nNote: It is critical to disturb the mice as little as possible during this time (birth to day 7). We expect some loss of pups in the time from birth to weaning, however, limiting any disruption during this time will help to reduce any loss of pups.\nWean pups at day 21 post birth.\nNote: Cease antibiotic treatment at day 21 +/- 1 day post birth and replace antibiotic-supplemented drinking water with sterile drinking water. Wean all pups at this timepoint also.\nNote: Depending on your ethics approval, unexposed dams may be reused for other purposes.",
    "Note: It is important to wean antibiotic exposed pups separately from unexposed pups, as exposed pups have a depleted microbiome. It is recommended to wean the antibiotic treated pups first and wean the unexposed pups secondly.\nHumanely kill dams (as antibiotic exposed dams cannot usually be re-used for breeding or other experiments).\nWean antibiotic exposed and unexposed pups separately.\nSeparate pups in each litter into males and females.\nEar notch pups for identification.\nPlace one pup from each litter in a new cage with 4 other mice, each from different litters (same sex and within the same treatment group).\nCollect a fecal sample (consisting of 2–3 pellets) at this timepoint as described Collect fecal samples: step 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#o0305].\nCritical: One littermate from each dam should be randomly assigned to each cage. Antibiotic exposed and control pups need to be caged separately. Co-housing would likely result in a more rapid recovery in the microbiota of antibiotic exposed mice due to coprophagy.\nNote: We only used male pups for this experiment, as metabolic differences such as weight gain, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperleptinemia are often easier to observe in male mice (Hwang et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]). However, both sexes may be used.\nNote: Although some fecal samples can be collected from mice from day 15 post birth, its availability is unreliable. Mice must be humanely culled to collect cecal contents prior to this timepoint.\nLongitudinal fecal sampling\nTiming: 1 h for duration of experiment",
    "Collect fecal samples longitudinally throughout the experiment to assess changes to the composition of the gut microbiota in antibiotic exposed mice compared to control mice and recovery following antibiotic exposure. In our study, we collected fecal samples at 3, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, and 102 weeks post birth and at the same timepoints from control mice.\nCollect fecal samples from antibiotic exposed and control mice throughout the duration of the experiment.\nCollect fecal pellets using the methods described in Collect fecal samples: step 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#o0305].\nCollect 1–2 fecal samples from each individual mouse 7 days following cessation of antibiotic exposure, at day 28 of life.\nCollect fecal samples every 7 days for the first 4 weeks following cessation of antibiotics, and at least every 3 months subsequently for the duration of the experiment.\nMonitor body condition and record weight monthly for each individual mouse for the duration of the project weekly as per ethics requirements.\nNote: By 7 days following the cessation of antibiotic exposure we consistently observe that the gut microbiota is recolonized by a low diversity microbiota, typically dominated by blooms of taxa that are present at a low relative abundance in untreated mice such as the Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus, Lachnospiraceae and/or Akkermansiaceae.",
    "Critical: While there are some common features, recolonization of the gut microbiota following antibiotic exposures appears to be somewhat stochastic in nature. It is therefore essential not to assume that the composition of the microbiota following antibiotic exposure will be the same/similar between different experiments, cages or even individual mice. To assess this, it is essential to collect fecal samples individually from all mice in each independent experiment. One should also note that the time required for the gut microbiota to recover to a state similar to unexposed mice is also likely to be variable between different individuals/cages/experiments.\nLongitudinal health monitoring\nTiming: 1–2 h weekly for duration of experiment\nTo assess whether antibiotic exposure in early life is associated with impaired healthspan or lifespan, mice in both the antibiotic exposed and unexposed groups should be monitored for at least 100 weeks. This is considered old age as conventionally housed SPF mice typically live for up to 2 years (Flurkey et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). As the mice age, weekly in-depth health monitoring is recommended. Body weight and body condition monitoring should be increased from monthly monitoring (from 4 weeks to 20 weeks) to weekly monitoring (from >20 weeks of age) as per ethics requirements. Humane endpoints should be determined in advance of the experiment starting. Consider the expected decline in aged mice when defining humane endpoints. Deaths should be recorded as soon as they are observed, and necropsies should be carried out wherever possible.\nNote: In many cases mice will reach humane endpoints rather than dying, but in our experience, mice will also be found dead in cages without prior overt evidence of a decline in health.\nConduct health monitoring on aged mice on a weekly basis from 20 weeks of age.",
    "Weigh each mouse individually on a weekly basis and record weights.\nMonitor for 15% weight loss within a week.\nMonitor for long-term weight loss of 15% below the 50th percentile as defined by the growth weight curve for the colony at 12 weeks of age, accounting for sex.\nIf either of these weight loss criteria are met, the mouse should be humanely culled.\nRecord the date and reason for humane culling in an appropriate database.\nNote: The rationale for using body weight at 12 weeks of age as a benchmark for a humane endpoint is that it is assumed that mice have reached an adult lean body mass by this time.\nScore body condition for each mouse on a weekly basis based on criteria outlined by Ullman and Foltz (Ullman-Cullere and Foltz, 1999[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib31]).\nMonitor for hunching.\nMonitor for coat condition.\nMonitor for movement upon stimulation.\nMonitor gait.\nMonitor for orbital tightening.\nScore each mouse weekly from 0 to 5 based on these criteria.\nConsult the Animal Welfare Officer or equivalent if a body score of 3 out of 5 is reached and consider humane culling to avoid any unnecessary suffering.\nHumanely cull any mouse with a body condition score of 4 out of 5.\nRequest or preform a necropsy to investigate possible reasons for decline in body condition.\nIf a mouse is found dead, notify the Animal Welfare Officer or equivalent immediately and request/perform a necropsy.\nRecord date of death and any details available including possible cause of death, and appearance of age related conditions, for example seminal vesicles appearance aged male mice etc.",
    "Note: As the mice age, it may be necessary to terminate the experiment to avoid any unnecessary suffering. In the case of our experiment, we ended the experiment at 102 weeks, when one of the experimental groups had reached 40% survival, to ensure that were enough mice left at the designated termination date for organ collection.\nPart 2: DNA extraction\nTiming: 4–6 h\nDNA is extracted from individual fecal samples using the DNeasy Powerlyzer Powersoil kit (Qiagen) to assess bacterial load via a 16S rRNA gene qRT-PCR assay and to assess the composition of the fecal microbiota by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.\nExtract DNA from fecal samples as per manufacturer’s instructions https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=329362e4-03e6-4ae1-9e4e-bbce41abe4b7&lang=en[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=329362e4-03e6-4ae1-9e4e-bbce41abe4b7&lang=en]\nNote: A reagent control consisting of 1× PBS instead of a fecal sample should be used with every extraction to ensure that reagents are not contaminated.\nNote: Recommend processing up to 24 samples at once (including a reagent control) for this protocol.\nCritical: Weight of the starting fecal sample is necessary for subsequent analysis.\nWeigh fecal sample.\nLabel and weigh microcentrifuge tube to be used for each sample DNA extraction.\nPlace 1–2 fecal pellets into the pre-weighed tube.\nRe-weigh the microcentrifuge tube containing the fecal sample(s).\nRecord the weight of fecal sample minus the weight of the tube.\nResuspend fecal samples in 1× Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) solution.\nAdd 1 mL of 1× PBS to fecal samples collected from an adult mouse and 500 μL to fecal samples collected from a 3–4 week old mouse. Vortex vigorously.\nSpin solution at 13,000×g for 5 min at RT and remove supernatant.\nPause point: The fecal pellet may be safely stored at −80°C at this step.\nContinue with extraction procedure as directed by the manufacturer.",

Replace collection tube.",
    "Add 500 μL of C5 solution to spin column, spin at 10,000×g for 1 min, discard flow-through. Spin again at 10,000×g for 3 min.\nPrepare a new collection tube (not provided by manufacturer); remove lid from a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube, and carefully place the spin column inside.\nAdd DNA with 50 μL of C6 or nuclease-free H2O to spin column filter and incubate for 1 min.

However, these values will depend on the antibiotics used.\nPart 3: 16S rRNA gene qRT-PCR\nTiming: 3–4 h",
    "Prepare 16S rRNA gene qRT-PCR To assess whether the antibiotic treatment successfully depleted the gut microbiota, a qRT-PCR assay assessing the number of 16S rRNA gene copies in extracted fecal samples is recommended. All reactions should be carried out in duplicate.\nNote: Master mix, primers and nuclease-free H2O are combined and added in a single solution to plate.\nCritical: Use separate barrier tips to ensure no mixing of DNA.\nCalculate the amount of master mix components needed by multiplying the volumes in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] by the total number of reactions to be performed including samples, controls, and standards in duplicate, and a few extra for pipetting errors, etc.\nPrepare the master mix solution consisting of SYBR green PCR master mix and the forward and reverse primer, in a sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and keep on ice (in a template-free room).\nDilute the template DNA 1 in 100 in sterile nuclease-free H2O for untreated mice, 1 in 10 for antibiotic-treated mice.\nAdd 3 μL diluted DNA onto a PCR plate (96/384 depending on setup) to the bottom of each well (equivalent to 1–3 ng of DNA/reaction).\nAdd 7 μL master mix solution to each well.\nNote: Use lab texter to inscribe sections onto plate to assist with plating out. Load DNA first. Add master mix second.\nPrepare a no template DNA control (NTC), where DNA is substituted for 3 μL nuclease-free H2O and include in every analysis.\nPrepare a negative reagent control (NRC), where 1× PBS is used instead of fecal samples during DNA extraction.\nPrepare a standard curve using DNA extracted from DH5α competent cells Culture DH5α Escherichia coli: step 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#o0045].\nPrepare 6 successive serial dilutions 1 in 10 with nuclease-free H2O using DNA extracted from DH5α competent cells\nLoad 3 μL of standards in place of template DNA.",
    "Note: The starting concentration of our E. coli stock is usually 2.8 ng/μl following the protocol as outlined, before you begin: step 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#o0045].\nBriefly spin the PCR plate at 200×g for 10 s to remove any air bubbles and ensure liquid is at the bottom of the well.\nLoad plate using the settings outlined in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\nNote: Calculations for obtaining copy number per mg of feces are detailed in Part 5: 16S rRNA gene standard curve calculations.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1476_1.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1476_2.csv\nPart 4: 16S rRNA gene library preparation and sequencing\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nUse 16S rRNA gene sequencing to longitudinally profile the composition of the fecal microbiota following early life antibiotic exposure. Extracted fecal DNA is used to generate amplicons of the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene using the 515F and 806R primers (Illumina). For an in-depth protocol for 16S rRNA gene sequencing library preparation, please refer to the Nextera XT Index kit.\nGenerate 16S rRNA gene sequencing reads\nMultiplex samples using a dual-index approach with the Nextera XT Index kit (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (https://sapac.support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/documentation/chemistry_documentation/16s/16s-metagenomic-library-prep-guide-15044223-b.pdf[href=https://sapac.support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/documentation/chemistry_documentation/16s/16s-metagenomic-library-prep-guide-15044223-b.pdf]).\nGenerate, clean, index and sequence amplicons according to the Illumina MiSeq 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation protocol (http://support.illumina.com/downloads/16s_metagenomic_sequencing library_preparation.html[href=http://support.illumina.com/downloads/16s_metagenomic_sequencing%20library_preparation.html]).\nSequence amplicon libraries on the Illumina Miseq system using 2 × 300 bp runs.\nNote: Library generation and sequencing is routinely offered by genomics core facilities. We recommend the use of these facilities for library preparation and sequencing.\nNote: Sequencing analyses are detailed in Part 6: 16S rRNA gene sequence data normalization and taxonomic assignment[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.9].\nSurvival analysis\nGenerate a Kaplan Meier curve to assess differences in survival between control and antibiotic exposed mice.\nUse the Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon or log-rank tests to assess whether differences between experimental groups are statistically significant.",
    "Note: We used the Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test in our study as this test gives more weight to deaths at early time points, which is important since all mice are expected to begin to reach end-of-life towards the end of the 102 week experiment.\nPart 5: 16S rRNA gene standard curve calculations\nThe E. coli DNA standard curve is used to estimate the number of copies of the 16S rRNA gene in each sample.\nCalculate bacterial load using the E. coli DH5α DNA standard curve.\nInput the starting concentration of the standard curve into the qRT-PCR software program. Insert number of dilutions and dilution factor into the software to enable the software to generate the standard curve.\nNote: The qRT-PCR programs, (including the Applied Biosystems software), uses the standard curve (mean Cq – y-intercept) / slope) to generate a corresponding quantity for each sample.\nNote: We use E. coli DNA at 2.8 ng/μl as our highest standard and create successive 1 in 10 serial dilutions to create our standard curve.\nCritical: The cfu/ml of the standard curve is known (before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]: step 2). E. coli has 7 16S copies per genome (Nadkarni et al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]), thus cfu/ml multiplied by 7 is equal to the number of copies/ml.\nAccount for any dilution that has been made to your sample.\nMultiply the cfu/mL by 7 to calculate the average of 16S rRNA gene copies for the E. coli standard curve.\nMultiply copies/mL by 100 to get total copies for the DNA extraction, as the fecal DNA was eluted in 100 μL.\nDivide the copies/extraction by the weight of the fecal samples (in mg) to give an approximate bacterial load per mg of feces.",
    "Note: This calculation differs for different bacterial species. If the colonizing species is known, a more accurate number for the 16S rRNA copies may be generated using this method. However, in the case of a mix of different bacterial species, this method works well to detect 10-fold increases/decreases in bacterial load between groups.\nNote: We find that estimation of bacterial loads by qRT-PCR is possible even with as little as 10 mg of feces is extracted. However, the dilution used for the qRT-PCR will need to be adjusted as low concentrations of DNA may lead to overestimation/underestimation of bacterial load, (Nadkarni et al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]) for more information.\nPart 6: 16S rRNA gene sequence data normalization and taxonomic assignment\nIn brief, the analysis pipeline for the 16S rRNA amplicon data consists of quality control assessments of the raw reads, generating exact sequence variants (ESVs), assigning taxonomy, and analysis of alpha and beta-diversity to characterize the composition of the gut microbiota.\nNormalize and assign taxonomy to generated 16S rRNA gene sequence data.\nDemultiplex paired end 16S rRNA gene sequences and import into QIIME2 for processing (Bolyen et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nCorrect sequence errors and generate counts of error-corrected reads per sample using DADA2 (Callahan et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nConstruct a phylogenetic tree of error-corrected sequences using FastTree (Price et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]).\nAssign taxonomy to sequences with the sklearn plugin for QIIME2 with an 80% confidence threshold, using a recent version of the GreenGenes database (DeSantis et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nPredict relative abundance using PICRUSt2 (Douglas et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nGenerate alpha and beta diversity statistics using the R package PhyloSeq version 1.3 (McMurdie and Holmes, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]).\nPerform further statistical analysis using R version 3.6.3, graphing using ggplot2 v3.3.0 and normalize all count data for library size prior to visualization or statistical testing.",
