Determination of siderophore production Rhizosphere soil samplingRhizosphere soil samples were collected from tomato plants located in four different fields. The excess soil should be gently shaken off and discarded; the remaining soil attached to the roots is considered the rhizosphere soil (Hu et al., 2016) and should be collected for use.Isolation of rhizobacteriaMix 1 g rhizosphere soil with 9 ml MS buffer solution in a rotary shaker (170 rpm) at 30°C for 30 min.Dilute the soil suspension to a concentration of 10-5-10-6 g/ml with sterile water. Spread 100 μl diluted soil suspensions on 1/10 tryptone soya agar (TSA).After a 48-h incubation at 30°C in the dark, randomly pick 32 isolates per rhizosphere soil sample and restreak on TSA plates for colony purification.Culture all purified isolates in 100 μl tryptone soya broth (TSB) in 96-well microtiter plates at 30°C with shaking (rotary shaker at 170 rpm) for 18 h.Add 100 μl 30% (v/v) glycerin to the fermentation broth and mix well. Store the rhizobacteria at -80°C.Measuring siderophore production of rhizobacteria (Figure 1)Revive the isolates by transferring 5 μl respective freezer stocks into a clean 96-well plate containing 195 μl TSB per well. Culture the bacteria overnight at 30°C with shaking (rotary shaker set at 170 rpm).Transfer 10 μl overnight cultures into clean 96-well plates containing 190 μl MKB iron-limited medium and MKB iron-rich medium. Incubate for 48 h at 30°C with shaking (rotary shaker set at 170 rpm).Harvest the cell-free supernatant from the bacterial cultures by centrifugation (4,000 rpm, 5 min at 4°C) and filtration (using a 0.22-µm filter).",
    "Use the liquid version of the chrome azurol S (CAS) assay, in which 100 µl cell-free supernatant (three biological replicates for each of the 2,150 soil isolates) is added to 100 μl CAS assay solution in a 96-well plate using a 96-channel manual pipetting workstation. Add 100 μl MKB iron-limited meduim or MKB iron-rich medium to 100 μl CAS assay solution as a control group.Incubate the reaction mixture without agitation for 2 h at room temperature.The OD630 of the reaction mixture (A) and the control group (Ar) was measured using a plate reader (SpectraMax M5) at room temperature. Siderophores induce a color change in the CAS medium, which lowers the OD630 measurements.Siderophore production was quantitated using the following formula: 1 − A ÷ Ar.Organic acids in media components and other secreted compounds can also bind iron; therefore, it is essential to estimate the CAS signal background that is not due to siderophores. We assessed this signal background using defined siderophore-deficient mutants from two species (P. aeruginosa PAO1ΔpvdDΔpchEF and B. cenocepacia H111ΔorbJΔpchAB) (Ghysels et al., 2005; Sathe et al., 2019) and their corresponding wild types using the same protocol as described above. We then averaged the CAS background signals of the two siderophore-deficient mutants, which was used as a cut-off to distinguish siderophore producers from non-producers among our 2,150 rhizobacteria(Figure 2A)."
