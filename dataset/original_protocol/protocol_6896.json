    "RFID Antenna Setup (Figure 2)Cut 2” × 2” pegboard squares for each cage with two holes in each square: Take the pegboard and draw lines to make cuts orthogonally such that:One set of lines runs across every other hole.The other set of lines runs ½” between every other hole.Using a table saw, carefully cut through the lines (Figure 2A).Place the pegboard square white-side-up. Using a drill and a 3/16” drill bit, drill diagonally through one of the holes, such that the angled hole points away from the center of the square (distal end on the bottom). Repeat this process for every square.Note: The purpose of this step is to make the existing pegboard hole wider for the antenna head to lie flat on the pegboard once the antenna wire is threaded through. Thread the wire of an antenna through the angled hole of a pegboard square, such that the wire comes out the bottom (brown side). Have the base of the antenna cover both holes as much as possible.Place a double-sided CommandTM strip on the surface of the pegboard, covering the hole opposite to the hole that the antenna wire is threaded through. Affix the base of the antenna to the top (white side) of the pegboard square to the double-sided CommandTM strip (Figure 2B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4071/bioprotoc-11-13-4071-g002.jpgFigure 2. Antenna setup. A. Proper dimensions of the pegboard square in relation to the antenna and CommandTM strip. B-C. Proper assembly of the antenna and pegboard square in top-down (B) and side-profile (C) views.Cage Setup (Figure 3)Pre-determine and assign two mice of the same sex to each running cage. Plan to construct RFID-compatible running cages based on the number of mouse pairs used in your study.",
    "Position the wheel housing on the underside of the wire lid adjacent to the food hopper of the Techniplast cage so that:The wheel is in front of and to the left of the food and water area.The left edge of the wheel housing is three slots away from the left edge of the cage.The screw of the housing is flush with the crossbar closest to the hopper.The slot for the reed switch faces toward the nearest wall of the cage.Screw the washer and wingnut onto the screw to affix the housing to the wire lid (Figure 3A).Using scissors, cut a strip of netting material the width of the running wheel, such that the mesh fits around the outer rim of the wheel. This is used so the limbs of the small juvenile mice do not fall through the rungs of the wheel.CAUTION: Ensure that this fit is precise. Improperly fitted netting (when cut too narrow) can slide on the wheel and potentially injure the mouse tail.Unscrew the axle of the wheel housing, place the wheel inside the housing with the wheel magnet facing outward, and thread the axle through the housing and the wheel, screwing the axle cap back on.Place the assembled RFID antenna and pegboard square directly underneath the wheel in its cage (aim the wire end of the antenna toward the back wall of the cage) and secure the antenna and pegboard square into place with a double-sided CommandTM strip. Mark a circle with the diamond-tipped pen next to where the hole with the wire is (Figure 3B). Take away the antenna-pegboard square by pulling out the CommandTM strip laterally.Flip over the cage such that the base is on top. Using the drill and a 5/32” drill bit, drill the spot that was marked.",
    "When a complete hole has been made, use the 3/16” drill bit to widen the hole. Drill diagonally through the hole, such that the hole exit on the bottom of the cage points toward the back wall.Note: Steps B1-B6 only need to be performed once for each cage. Flip over the cage to an upright position. Place the antenna and pegboard square back into the cage. Thread the antenna wire through the hole, such that the wire points out of the bottom of the back wall. Readjust the antenna and pegboard square until it is squarely under the wheel. Affix the bottom of the pegboard to the cage bottom using a double-sided CommandTM strip (Figure 3C).Note: In subsequent assemblies using pre-drilled cages, the orientation of the antenna can be modified to a non-orthogonal position with respect to the cage base. It is crucial to ensure that the center of the antenna is directly under the center of the wheel.Add a thin layer of bedding to the cage bottom until the bedding submerges the pegboard but not the antenna. Place two nesting squares into the bottom of the cage, away from the wheel. Place the wire lid with the wheel over the cage, such that the wheel lies above the antenna with adequate clearance (Figure 3D). Cover the cage with the filtered cage top.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4071/bioprotoc-11-13-4071-g003.jpgFigure 3. Cage setup. A.

    "Threading of the antenna wire through the cage hole. D. Clearance between the antenna and the wheel.RFID + VV System Setup (Figure 4)Set up the VitalView® system and RFID reader system per the manufacturer’s instructions. Initialize as many VitalView® channels and RFID antennae as you anticipate possibly needing at one time. Keep the data recording configurations for each system as default, such that recording intervals for VitalView® are less than or equal to 1 minute, and the channel names remain numeric and sequential (1-24). Using one VitalView® system (24-port), one RFID reader (4-port), and three RFID multiplexers (8-port), a maximum of 24 cages can be equipped for individual tracking.Connect one antenna wire to one port on the RFID reader or multiplexer using the 60” LMR 100 cables (Figure 4).Thread one reed switch into the reed switch slot in each running cage. Plug the other end of the reed switch cable into the port on the VitalView® box (Figure 4). Test your wheel setup by spinning the running wheel, and adjust the depth of insertion of the reed switch until wheel revolutions are recorded by the VitalView® system.Note: The configuration with one RFID reader and one multiplexer can track 11 cages at a time, with two mice in each cage. Additional multiplexers can be added to increase the capacity of simultaneously recorded cages. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4071/bioprotoc-11-13-4071-g004.jpgFigure 4. RFID and VitalView® system setup. Schematic of data feeds from parallel RFID and VitalView® systems. RFID reader connections can be expanded to multiple cages using an RFID multiplexer. Each RFID antenna is connected to the reader or multiplexer via a 60” LMR 100 cable. We typically use separate computers for VitalView® and RFID reader software (AdvanNetTM Software) programs.Mouse Tagging (Figure 5)Etch each RFID tag based on the cage number (e.g.",
    ", 1, 2, …) and animal ID within a cage (e.g., A, B) using the diamond-tipped pen.On the laptop using the RFID software (instructions in AdvanNetTM User Guide), change an RFID tag’s EPC code to e0000000000000000000001A, e0000000000000000000001B, e…2A, e…2B, etc. based on the tag number that was etched into it (Figure 5A). Assign these numbers, as well as the mice, so that they match the channel names 1-24 from the VitalView® channels; e.g., mice tagged 1A and 1B must be in the cage connected to VitalView® channel 1, and so forth.Scruff the P21 mouse. Using the Stoelting ear tags and ear tag applicator, tag each mouse on one ear (Figure 5B). Alternate ears (left vs. right), if possible, for easy visual identification of pair-housed mice.Place a small drop of super glue on the green base of an RFID tag (Figure 5C). Using the tweezers, carefully affix the glued side of the RFID tag onto the Stoelting tag on the mouse’s ear. Holding the RFID tag and ear tag in place between the tweezer tips, let the glue dry for approximately 30 seconds (Figure 5D).Place the mice in the cage. Ensure that mice 1A and 1B, indicated by the EPC code of the RFID tag affixed to them, are in the cage connected to VitalView® port 1. Repeat with the other cages.Note: It is recommended that daily in-person monitoring is performed to identify and prevent the possibility of jammed wheels or insecure or fallen tags. These are infrequent occurrences in our experience; however, they can introduce error into the data collected if not addressed quickly. These issues can be easily remedied with proper supervision of the apparatus. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4071/bioprotoc-11-13-4071-g005.jpgFigure 5. Mouse tagging. A.

    "The mouse is scruffed, and an ear tag is attached to mouse’s left ear. C. Super glue has been added to the base of the RFID tag, and the RFID tag can be picked up with the tweezers. Only a minimal amount of super glue is needed to affix the RFID tag to the ear tag. D. The RFID tag is applied to the ear tag and held in place for about 30 seconds to allow the glue to dry.RFID Cage and Antenna ReuseOnce the experiment is completed, unplug the antenna from the LMR100 cable. Remove the antenna and pegboard square by pulling the CommandTM strips laterally. Dispose of the pegboard. Save the antenna and wash carefully with water and a sponge.Pre-drilled cages and washed antennae may be reused for future experiments. A new pegboard square must be used for each cage."
