Their volume should not exceed 10% of the total reaction volume. We usually elute the donor vectors from midi-prep with 100 μL elution buffer to make the final concentration of each donor vector around 2,000 ng/μL. The quality of donor plasmid is important for successful tagging. We checked the integrity of donor vectors before use by using agarose gel electrophoresis.\nSynthesis of sgRNA\nTiming: 1 day (for steps 18 to 20)",

In our hand, each transcription reaction can produce about 40 μg sgRNA at 2 h of incubation.\nAdd 1 μL of DNase I into the reaction mix after the transcription reaction, mix by pipetting, and incubate at 37°C for 15 min to remove the sgRNA DNA template.\nDilute 0.5 μL of the IVT product in 10 μL of nuclease-free water, and mix with RNA loading dye.\nHeat the sample at 70°C for 10 min to denature the sgRNA and chill on ice, then run on a 2% Agarose Gel against an RNA Ladder to check the integrity of synthesized sgRNA. The expected sgRNA transcript size is 100 bases.\nPurify in vitro transcribed sgRNA.\nAdjust the volume of the IVT product to 200 μL with nuclease-free water.\nAdd 100 μL of Binding Buffer. Mix thoroughly by pipetting.",
    "Add 300 μL of ethanol (>96%) and mix by pipetting.\nTransfer the mixture to the GeneJET RNA Purification Micro Column and centrifuge for 30–60 s at 14,000 × g.

Make 4 μg aliquots for each sgRNA with PCR tubes and freeze them at −80°C. sgRNA is generally stable at −80°C for more than one year without degradation.\nDeliver CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing reagents into cells using nucleofection\nTiming: 3–4 days (for steps 21 to 36)\nThe purpose of this step is to deliver the in vitro assembled Cas9/sgRNA ribonucleoprotein complex and donor vectors into the cells using nucleofection. We used the Lonza Nucleofector 2b Device and Human Stem Cell Nucleofector Kit 1 for nucleofection of iPSCs.\nPrepare the iPSCs for nucleofection. Grow 1 million iPSCs for 1 nucleofection.\nNote: High quality iPSCs with normal morphology and growth rate are very important for successful tagging. The iPSCs are ready for nucleofection when they reach to 80%–90% confluency. Meanwhile, maintain the growth of iPSC, which will be used as control in the cell sorting step.\nPrepare the Matrigel coated well for seeding nucleofection cells.",

Resuspend the cell pellet carefully with the mixed nucleofection reagents from step 28.\nTransfer the cell suspension into the nucleofector cuvette using a P200 pipet and avoid creating any bubbles.\nNote: Any bubbles in the cuvette will destroy the nucleofection reaction or decrease the transfection efficiency.\nGently tap the nucleofector cuvette to make sure the sample covers the bottom of the cuvette.\nTransfer the cuvette with a closed lid to Lonza nucleofector and start nucleofection process.\nNote: We used Lonza nucleofector 2b device with program A-023.\nTake out the cuvette immediately when nucleofection process is finished.\nResuspend the cells in the cuvette with the prepared mTeSR1 medium.",
    "Add 1 mL of the prepared mTeSR1 medium from step 25 into the cuvette.\nTransfer the cell suspension to the prepared Matrigel coated wells from step 26 using the provided single use pipet by adding 0.5 mL into each well.\nWash the cuvette with 1 mL medium again and transfer 0.5 mL to each well.\nNote: In this step, we seed the 1 million cells after nucleofection into 2 wells of a 6-well plate with 0.5 million per well.\nGently shake the plate left/right and forward/backward to ensure even seeding. Incubate the cells in a 37°C / 5% CO2 incubator.\n24 h after nucleofection, change the culture medium daily with mTeSR1 medium without Rock inhibitor and grow the nucleofection cells for 3–4 days to let them reach 80%–90% confluency.\nNote: Lonza 4D-Nucleofector system can also be used for human iPSC nucleofection. We tested Lonza 4D-nucleofector with P3 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector X Kit L for WTC11 iPSCs and turned out with successful nucleofection.\nGenerating tagged clonal cell lines with single-cell sorting\nTiming: 4 h (for steps 37 to 41)\nThe purpose of this step is to sort the bi-allelically tagged single cell into 96-well plate by Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS) and establish the bi-allelically tagged iPSC clones.\nPrepare Matrigel coated 96-well plate.\nRemove the Matrigel when the coating is done and add 150 μL of the mTeSR1 medium (with Rock inhibitor and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin) into each well of the 96-well plate.\nNote: We usually prepare 2 plates for one target gene.\nDetach the nucleofection cells and control cells without nucleofection with Accutase. Resuspend the cells with FACS buffer to 2 × 106 cells/mL.",
    "Sort the bi-allelically tagged single cells into the prepared 96-well plate by using BD FACSAria II cell sorter.

Then, single cells were separated using a single cell gate based on the width and area metrics of the forward scatter (Gate 2: FSC-W verse FSC-A) and side scatter (Gate 3: SSC-W versus SSC-A). Further, the gata for EGFP and mCherry negative cells were set using control cells without nucleofection (Gate 4: EGFP versus mCherry). Four cell populations were observed in the SIN3A nucleofection cell pool compared to the control cells. The EGFP and mCherry double positive population contains the cells with allelic tagging for two alleles of SIN3A.\nUse the control cells and set the gate to separate the cells from debris based on the forward scatter area (FSC-A) and side scatter area (SSC-A).\nUse the control cells and set the gate for single cells using forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC).\nSet the baseline for EGFP and mCherry signal using control cells.\nSwitch to the nucleofection cells and set the gate for EGFP and mCherry double positive cells.\nSort the EGFP and mCherry double positive cells from nucleofection cells into 96-well plate with 1 cell/well using single cell mode.",
    "Note: For successful bi-allelic tagging, you should see four cell populations in FACS plot, two single positive populations, one double positive population and one double negative population (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). The bi-allelic tagging efficiency may vary among different targets. The percentage of the double positive population for SIN3A bi-allelic tagging is about 0.15%.\nNote: Plate alignment is a crucial step for plate-based single cell sorting. We noticed the plate sizes vary from different manufacturers. To ensure cells are appropriately collected at the center of each well, please check the plate position by releasing testing droplets to the wells.\nIncubate 96-well plates in a 37°C / 5% CO2 incubator.\nNote: Refresh half media with 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin every 3 days for the first week with a 200 μL multichannel pipette without perturbing the cells. The Penicillin-Streptomycin will inhibit any contamination from sorting. Clones become visible after 1 week. Check the clones with a microscope and mark the clones with only one colony in the well. After one week, refresh half or whole media every 2 days for another week.\nValidating tagged cell lines by genotyping PCR\nTiming: 1 day (for steps 42 to 52)\nThe purpose of this step is to verify the bi-allelically tagged clones with genotyping PCR.\nDesign the genotyping primers to confirm the successful bi-allelic tagging.\nNote: We designed 4 pairs of genotyping primers for SIN3A bi-allelic tagging (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A, Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]).
