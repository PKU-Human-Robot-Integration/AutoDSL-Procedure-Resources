    "All procedures involving animals were approved by the Danish National Ethics Committee according to the guidelines set forth in the European Council’s Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals Used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes and were in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines. This is a terminal procedure with the mice being euthanized prior to anesthetic recovery.\n1. Pre-surgical preparation\nClean the surgical table and all the surrounding area with 70% ethanol. Thoroughly clean and dry the surgical tools before the surgery.\nAnesthetize an NG2DsRed mouse (Tg(Cspg4-DsRed.T1)1Akik/J; both genders; 4-8 months old) by a peritoneal injection of ketamine + xylazine (60 mg/kg + 10 mg/kg) dissolved in sterilized water, pH 7.4. Administer supplemental doses of ketamine (30 mg/kg) every 25 min until completion of the surgical procedure. Check tail and toe pinch reflexes regularly to verify the depth of anesthesia.\nInject saline subcutaneously at four different locations on the back of the mouse for a total volume of 1 mL to prevent dehydration during the experiment. To protect the eyes from drying out, apply eye lubricant. Maintain body temperature at 37 °C using a rectal temperature probe and heating blanket.\n2. Surgical procedure\nTracheotomy \nPlace the mouse on its back. Inject 0.04 mL of 0.5% lidocaine subcutaneously under the planned incision and wait for 2 min. Make a 10 mm long incision above the chest bone (manubrium). Separate the submandibular glands and sternothyroid muscles, and then expose the trachea.\nMake tracheostomy between two tracheal rings with scissors. Insert a small metal tube with a length of 16.2 mm and a diameter of 1 mm into the trachea. Connect the tube to a mechanical ventilator and capnograph to monitor the end-expiratory CO2 (Figure 1A).\nCatheter insertion",
    "Inject 0.5% lidocaine (0.04 mL) subcutaneously under the planned incision and wait for 2 min.\nUsing fine tip forceps gently separate the artery from the vein. Stop the blood flow upstream with a microvascular clamp. Constrict the blood flow downstream with a 10-0 nylon suture ligating both blood vessels.\nUse micro-dissecting scissors to make a small incision in both the artery and the vein. Insert plastic catheters into both blood vessels. Secure the catheters by tightening the sutures (8-0 or 10-0 nylon sutures dependent on the vessel size) without compromising catheter lumens. Remove the microvascular clamp and close the skin.\nMonitor blood pressure via the arterial catheter. Measure levels of blood gases in arterial blood samples (50 μL) before and after each experiment (normal values: pO2, 90-120 mmHg; pCO2, 35-40 mmHg; pH, 7.25-7.45) using a blood gas analyzer. Use the vein catheter for infusion of fluorescein and anesthesia.\nCraniotomy\nShave the fur off the head of the mouse between the ears. Inject 0.04 mL of 0.5% lidocaine subcutaneously under the planned incision and wait for 2 min.\nWipe the skull using a 10% iron-chloride solution to remove the periosteum. Rinse the skull thoroughly with saline. Glue a metal head bar to the skull with cyanoacrylate glue and activator (Figure 1A).\n\t\tNOTE: The metal head bar is 75 mm long and 13.5 mm wide, with a round hole of 5 mm diameter in the center.\nDrill a 4-mm-diameter craniotomy, centered at 0.5 mm behind and 3 mm to the right of the bregma over the right sensory barrel cortex. Remove the dura with a fine-tip vessel dilator.",
    "Cover the exposed cortex with 0.75% agarose gel, dissolved in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; pH = 7.4) and cooled to 35 °C. Cover 80-90% of the craniotomy with a glass coverslip at an angle of 10-15° to the metal head bar (Figure 1B) that permits insertion and placement of the glass micro-pipette.\nTo minimize brain pulsation, glue the two corners of the glass coverslip onto the metal head bar with cyanoacrylate glue and activator. Apply the activator carefully to prevent getting onto the exposed brain. Rinse the glued glass coverslip thoroughly with saline afterwards.\nPerform insertion of the whisker pad stimulation probe. Insert a set of custom-made bipolar electrodes (8 mm length and 0.25 mm thickness) percutaneously into the left side of face to stimulate the ramus infraorbitalis of the trigeminal nerve contralateral to the craniotomy. Position the cathode close to the hiatus infraorbitalis, and insert the anode into the masticatory muscles7. Perform the stimulation with an electrical stimulator at an intensity of 1.5 mA for 1 ms in trains of 20 s at 2 Hz.\nUpon completion of surgery, administer a bolus of 0.05 mL fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FITC-dextran, 4% w/v, molecular weight [MW] 50,000) into the femoral vein to label the blood plasma. Discontinue ketamine and switch the anesthesia to continuous intravenous infusion of α-chloralose (17% w/v, final concentration) mixed with FITC-dextran (2% w/v, final concentration) at 0.02 mL/10 g/h. Wait for about half an hour for stabilization of the new anesthetic state.\n\tNOTE: Both FITC-dextran and α-chloralose are dissolved in 0.9% saline.\n3. First two-photon imaging session",
    "Transfer the mouse to the stage of a commercial two-photon microscope (Table of Materials). Under both red fluorescent protein (RFP, Figure 1C) and green fluorescent protein (GFP, Figure 1C) modes of epi-fluorescent illumination, take a picture of the exposed cortex with a 5x objective. Use the RFP picture as a 'map' for insertion of the glass micro-pipette in the next session.\n\tNOTE: The GFP 'map' is used to distinguish veins/venules from arteries/arterioles.\nPerform two-photon imaging using the two-photon microscope and a 25x 1.0 numerical aperture (NA) water-immersion objective with piezo motor. Set the excitation wavelength to 900 nm. Search the cortex and follow each penetrating arteriole and find its horizontal branches (1st order capillaries).\nImage penetrating arterioles and their 1st order capillaries at rest and during whisker pad stimulation. See the detailed imaging parameters in section 5.\nMark locations of 1st order capillaries with >5% vasodilation during whisker pad stimulation on the RFP 'map' (Figure 1C). Locations with <5% vasodilation are considered as being outside of the whisker barrel cortex region.\n\tNOTE: If using wild-type mice instead of NG2DsRed mice in the experiment, the GFP image is used as ‘map’ instead.\n4. Insertion of the glass micro-pipette\nPrepare glass micro-pipettes for puffing using a pipette puller (Table of Materials). The glass micro-pipettes have a resistance of 3-3.5 MΩ and a taper length of 4.5-5 mm. Load a pipette with a mixture of 1 mM ATP and 10 µM Alexa 594 in order to visualize the pipette tip under the epi-fluorescent lamp and two-photon microscope.\nMount the glass micro-pipette onto a patch clamp holder and connect it to an air pump. Set the pump holding pressure to 0 psi.",
    "Using red epi-fluorescent illumination, focus on the pipette tip with the 5x objective. Place the glass micro-pipette into the aCSF above the agarose. Adjust the holding pressure of the air pump to 0.2 psi. A small red cloud can be observed ejecting out of pipette tip in the aCSF. This is to prevent clogging during pipette insertion.\nChoose one of the marked locations in the RFP 'map' as destination. Move the pipette tip to the horizontal plane of the cover glass edge with 30 µm distance, roughly pointing towards the destination in the x-y plane.\nCarefully lower the pipette tip in z-axis under the cover glass slip. Then start advancing the glass pipette towards the destination until ~500 µm above the brain surface. Switch focus frequently between the cover glass edge, the pipette tip and the brain surface, making sure there is enough free space for moving the pipette.\nSwitch the objective to 25x. Re-center the pipette tip and advance the pipette tip further towards the destination on the RFP 'map'. Keep the pipette tip in the agarose layer.\nWhen the pipette tip is ~100 µm above the brain surface, switch the imaging mode to two-photon microscopy. Focus on a target location at which to puff. Write down its x, y coordinates (x0, y0) and its depth below the surface (z0). Calculate the coordinates of the insertion point on the brain surface (xi, yi) as follows:\nxi = x0 + z0 / tan θ\nyi = y0\n\twhere θ is the angle between the pipette holder and the horizontal plane.",
    "Position the pipette tip to the coordinates (xi, yi) on the brain surface. Gently and slowly insert the pipette until it reaches (x0, y0, z0). If a vessel is in the way of an insertion path, withdraw the pipette and re-calculate other insertion coordinates and path; or turn the stage plate slightly (as indicated in Figure 1A).\nSet the pump holding pressure at 0 psi and ejection pressure at 10-15 psi. Puff ATP for 200-400 ms at the target location during two-photon imaging. Adjust the pressure and duration of puffing for each pipette and over time as explained in the discussion section.\n5. Hyperstack two-photon imaging \nPerform experiments using the two-photon microscope and a 25 x 1.0 NA water-immersion objective with piezo motor. Set the excitation wavelength to 900 nm. Filter the emitted light to collect red light from DsRed (pericytes)/tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-dextran (TRITC-dextran) staining blood plasma and green light from FITC-dextran (blood plasma)/GCaMP6 (GFP, astrocytic calcium).\nProduce a high-resolution z-stack at the location of interest containing a penetrating arteriole, a 1st order capillary, a 2nd order capillary and possibly neighboring fluorescent cells (e.g., pericytes, astrocytes). Determine the x*y*z volume of hyperstack imaging by including the 3D structure of the blood vessels as much as possible. The total height of each stack may vary from 30-50 μm, while the x-y plane roughly covers an area of 60 µm x 40 µm.",
    "Set the image stack in the imaging software to be comprised of 8-10 planes with an inter-plane distance of 4-5 µm. The piezo-motor objective stops at each level on the z-axis to acquire the image of each plane. The sampling rate is 1 s per stack and pixel resolution in the x-y plane is 0.2-0.3 µm (Figure 2A). One recording normally includes 10 pre-puff image stacks and 150 post-puff image stacks.\n6. Data processing\nProcess data using custom-made analytical software. Flatten each image stack into one image by maximal intensity projection (Figure 2B). Draw a rectangular region of interest (ROI) with a width of 3 µm perpendicularly across the vessel of interest (Figure 2C).\nTo minimize interference from shadows of red blood cells and from minor vibrations of the cortex, average the rectangular ROI by projecting it into one line, which then represents the average profile of the vessel segment. Do this for each maximal intensity image.\nPlot the profile lines as a 2D image with the x-axis representing maximal intensity images in chronological order (Figure 2D, upper panel). Use an active contour algorithm (Chan-Vese segmentation) to find the edges of the vessel8,9 (indicated by red curves; Figure 2D, upper panel).\nCalculate the time course of the diameter changes as the difference between the edges of the blood vessel (vertical distance between the upper and lower red curves in Figure 2D, lower panel). Normalize diameter changes to pre-puffing diameter baseline and plot curves of diameter change over time. Do this for each ROI (Figure 2E).",
    "The vessel response amplitude is defined as the highest/lowest peak amplitude after puffing. The response latency is defined as the latency of half-max amplitude (Figure 2G). Manually trace the skeletonized vascular structure by placing nodes along the vessels (Figure 2F) and measuring geographical distance between each ROI and the penetrating arteriole. Calculate CVR speed by dividing the distances by latency differences.\n7. Viral vector injection\nIn order to simultaneously study astrocytic calcium responses, inject a volume of 0.6 µL viral vector (pZac2.1 gfaABC1D-lck-GCaMP6f, Addgene) into the somatosensory cortex of NG2DsRed mice, following the standard stereotactic viral vector injection procedure10.\nAfter three weeks, astrocytes in mouse somatosensory cortex express the genetically encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP6f. Follow the aforementioned surgical procedure and two-photon imaging for mice. To distinguish between astrocytes and vessel lumina, TRITC-dextran instead of FITC-dextran is used to stain vessel lumina red.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
