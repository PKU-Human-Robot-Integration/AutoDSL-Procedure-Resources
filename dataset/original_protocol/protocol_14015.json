    "NOTE: The following are search methods and an example search for each method is provided. Note that the part related specifically to bibliometric analysis is also supplied.\n1. PubMed\nChoose Advanced Search from PubMed homepage (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed).\nEnter the desired search term in the search field. Choose the search terms from the medical subject heading (MeSH) database. The following example details how to assess research in \"cancer\".\n\t\nOpen the MeSH database: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh.\nEnter the word \"cancer\" in the search field.\nEnsure that the results show the word \"neoplasms\" at the top of the search, where it notes that using the word \"neoplasms\" is more suitable, as \"neoplasms\" is the word used to index relevant topics.\nFurther check other terms listed under the term \"neoplasms\" by clicking on it. The results will show other terms used to describe similar topics (e.g., tumor), and will also list other subcategories (subheadings) under the term neoplasm.\nUse the drop-down lists in the Builder section to specify the field of the article that PubMed will search for the term in. Note that the following search fields are available: all fields, title, abstract, authors, affiliation, conflict of interest, language, journal, publisher, publication type, grant number, ISBN, and MeSH terms.\nAdd as many fields as needed and choose the relation between these fields (AND, OR, or NOT). See Table 1 for further details.\nClick Search.\nRefine the search results further in the results using different filters available as detailed in Table 2. Note that from now on, the final search done will be saved in the history of the Advanced Search, which was accessed in the first step. This means that the search can be paused at this step and resumed later.",
    "Ensure that each new search is saved in the Advanced Search history screen where it will be assigned a number (e.g., #2). Use this number in the search field above to subtract searched queries (e.g., \"#1 NOT #2\" to subtract results in search #2 from results of search #1).\nExport the results to further analyze them.\n\t\nUse the FLink tool (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/flink/flink.cgi) to export the results in a comma separated values (CSV) format, and choose PubMed from the Please choose a database to start drop-down list.\nChoose Input From Entrez History from the input screen, and an advanced PubMed search history will appear at the drop-down list.\nChoose the search performed in the previous steps at the PubMed advanced search and click Submit.\nView the resulting report since it provides the option of exporting the search results in a CSV format file.\nPerform the following steps to analyze Jordanian research output during a 5-year period between 1/1/2013 and 31/12/2017 using PubMed.\n\t\nOpen the Advanced search form in the document search form at the PubMed website (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed). \nUse Jordan as the search term and specify Affiliation as the search field. Note that PubMed interprets affiliation as all information related to the author (i.e., author's name, address, affiliation), so exclude any document authored by an author named \"Jordan\" in which the affiliation country is not Jordan. Follow the steps below to avoid including such irrelevant results.\nType Jordan in another field and choose the field type Author.\nChoose the operator NOT as the relation between the two fields and click on Search.\nSpecify Publication Dates from 1/1/2013 to 31/12/2017 in the results window, and choose Journal Article and Review from Article Types.\nOpen FLink (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/flink/flink.cgi), and choose PubMed as the database.",
    "Choose Input From Entrez History from the input screen, and choose the search from the drop-down list.\nClick Download CSV.\n\t\tNOTE: Figure 1 details the PubMed search report with annotation for each section of the report.\n2. Scopus\nRegister in order to access the full search capabilities of the Scopus database. Check if the local institution is already registered and has access to the database since academic institutions are usually registered in Scopus.\nGo to the website (www.scopus.com) and by default, Scopus opens the document search form screen.\nEnter the search term desired in the search field available.\nSpecify the fields in the article to be searched for. Note that the following search fields are available: all fields, title, abstract, keywords, authors, affiliations, funding information, language, references, conference, ISSN, CODEN, DOI, ORCID, and CAS number.\nAdd other fields to search for and indicate the relation between the newly added field and the other field already entered (AND, OR, or AND NOT). See ( Table 1) for further details.\nUse the Limit option to limit the search based on the options provided by Scopus, as detailed in Table 2.After executing the search, save the search and continue later if needed.\n\t\nIn this case, set an alert using the option Set alert, where an email will be sent when an article satisfying the searching criteria is added.\nRefine the search results further from the results directly by choosing from the options provided by Scopus ( Table 2), where Scopus shows the number of documents included for each option.\nChoose to either analyze the results directly on the Scopus website (click Analyze Search Results), or to export the results in either zip or CSV formats after completing the search criteria.",
    "Perform the following steps to analyze Jordanian research output during a 5-year period between 1/1/2013 and 31/12/2017 using Scopus.\n\t\nGo to the website (www.scopus.com) and by default, Scopus opens the document search form screen.\nType Jordan as the searching term in the document search form.\nSpecify Affiliation Country as the search field.\nLimit the search duration from 2013 to 2017. Note that from 2013 means from 1/1/2013, and to 2017 means to 31/12/2017.\nLimit the document type to Article or Review, and then click Search.\n\t\tNOTE: Figure 2 details the Scopus search report with annotation for each section of the report.\n3. Web of Science\nRegister in order to access the full search capabilities of the Web of Science database. Check if the local institution is already registered and has access to the database as academic institutions are usually registered in Web of Science.\nGo to the Web of Science home page (www.webofknowledge.com). The website opens the basic search and includes the Web of Science Core Collection as the selected database for search.\nSearch for the fields as detailed in Table 2.\nAdd another field (if needed) to connect both fields by either AND, OR, or NOT. See Table 1.\nDefine the duration that is searched down to 1945. After completing the search, the results are saved in the history and can be returned to at any time. If needed, set an alert if any new document is added to the search report.\nSort the results according to either data, times cited, usage counts, or to other categories from the drop-down list provided.\nRefine the search results further from the results directly by choosing from the options provided by Web of Science ( Table 2), where Web of Science shows the number of documents included for each option.",
    "View the results and analyze them via a tree map or bar graph. Note that there is a table showing the count in each category.\nDownload the results. Note that unlike Scopus and PubMed, Web of Science only allows the downloading of 5,000 records at a time (e.g., a 10,000 result search is downloaded in two batches, the first batch for the first 5,000 records, and a second batch for the next 5,000 records).\nPerform the following steps to analyze Jordanian research output during a 5-year period between 1/1/2013 and 31/12/2017 using Web of Science.\n\t\nType Jordan in the search field and specify Address as the search field.\nIdentify the duration of search between 2013 and 2017 and click Search.\nRestrict the search using Article and Review filters.\nChoose to analyze the results that are saved in Search History now or later.\nChoose to analyze the results in the form of tables or visual tree map and bars.\n\t\tNOTE: Figure 3 details the Web of Science search report with annotation for each section of the report.\nSubscription Required.
