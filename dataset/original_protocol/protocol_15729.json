    "All experimental procedures described here are in accordance with The European Community's Council Directive of 22 September 2010 (2010/63EU) and were approved by the local animal committee of the state Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany (file reference: 23 177-07/G16-1-075).\n1. Animal model of acute and prophylactically treated KA-induced epilepsy\nPerform seizure induction, treatment, and behavioral scoring.\n\t\nSeparate mice (minimum n = 6 mice per group) in single cages.\nPrepare seizure-induction injection solution and the corresponding vehicle (see Table 1), as well as treatment injection solution and the corresponding vehicle (see Table 2).\nInject mice intraperitoneally (i.p.) (10 mL/kg mouse body mass) without anesthesia according to their group identity: disease, treated, or vehicle treated (i.e., KA, PEA-treated KA, and the two vehicle groups). See Figure 2, Table 1, and Table 2.\nMonitor and score the behavior according to the following standardized seizure intensity scale: 0 = no response; 1 = immobility and staring; 2 = forelimb and/or tail extension, rigid posture; 3 = repetitive movements, head bobbing; 4 = rearing and falling; 5 = continuous rearing and falling; 6 = severe clonic-tonic seizures; 7 = death14,15 (Figure 3).\nPerform sacrificing procedure for lipidomic and transcriptomic analysis.\n\t\nAt four timepoints (i.e., 20, 60, 120, and 180 min post KA- or vehicle injection respectively), sacrifice six mice from each of the following groups: PEA treated, PEA-untreated epileptic vehicle 1, and vehicle 2, following IACUC approved protocols.\nTen seconds after each time point is reached, anesthetize the mice using an isoflurane-soaked tissue in a glass chamber. Confirm anesthesia by the loss of the righting reflex, indicated by the inability to move while slowly overturning the glass chamber. Decapitate mice using surgical scissors and collect plasma, brain, and peripheral organs (see steps 2.2.2−2.2.4).",
    "CAUTION: Ethical regulations for sacrificing procedures vary between local animal committees. Make sure to check and follow the regulations issued by the local animal committee.\nFollow sacrificing procedure for immunohistochemistry analysis.\n\t\nFor immunohistochemical staining13, behaviorally score three mice from each of the following groups: PEA treated, PEA-untreated epilepsy, and vehicle groups, over the entire time course (180 min).\nSacrifice and perfuse mice 5 days later. Deeply anesthetize mice (see step 1.3.1 for the mouse groups) by i.p. injection of pentobarbital (100 mg/kg) and buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) as narcotic drugs. Confirm deep anesthesia by the loss of reflex between the toes.\nFix the mouse on a polystyrene plate and immediately open the thorax using fine scissors and standard forceps. Set the butterfly in the left heart ventricle and cut the right atrium using fine scissors.\nAdjust the speed and pressure of the pump to a constant peristaltic flow with a rate of 2−3 mL/min. Perfuse with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for ~5 min. If necessary, replace the butterfly.\n\t\tNOTE: With proper perfusion, the inner organs (except the spleen) start to bleach out within 1−2 min.\nSwitch perfusion to ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution for ~5 min. Isolate whole brains as described in step 2.2.2 and fix for 24 h in 4% PFA solution at 4 °C.\nIncubate brains in 30% sucrose solution for 48 h at 4 °C. Remove the leftover sucrose with a dry tissue paper and freeze the brains on a metal plate (-80 °C). Store the brains at -80 °C for the staining procedures13.\n2. Sampling procedures for lipidomic/transcriptomic analysis\nPrepare for sampling.",
    "Precool EDTA-tubes for plasma sampling to 4 °C. Precool the centrifuge and vortex apparatus to 4 °C. Precool the metal plate covered with aluminum foil (to snap frozen brain and/or other tissues of interest) on dry ice (-80 °C). Precool the labeled 2 mL and 5 mL tubes on dry ice (-80 °C) for plasma aliquots, frozen tissue, and brain collection, respectively. Use amber tubes to protect light sensitive molecules, such as eiCs.\nClean the tissue sampling and isolation equipment (surgical scissors, straight sharp fine scissors, straight smooth standard forceps, fine forceps with mirror finish, curved forceps and spatula, polystyrene foam plate, and needles for fixation) with a disinfectant (e.g., 70% ethanol).\nSampling protocols\n\t\nDetermine the order of sampling.\n\t\t\nCollect blood immediately after decapitation in precooled 1 mL EDTA tubes (see step 2.2.3).\nRemove the whole brain and snap freeze immediately after removal. This step will take 1−2 min. Store frozen brains at -80 °C for further processing (see step 2.2.2).\nRemove peripheral organs of interest (e.g., lung, heart, liver), within 5 min post brain removal, and snap freeze and store at -80 °C for further processing (see step 2.2.4).\nRemove brain for dissection or punching procedures. This procedure takes 1−2 min/brain.\n\t\t\nAfter decapitation (see step 1.2), start making a midline incision in the skin using fine scissors. Free the skull by flipping the skin over the eyes. Reach to the top of the skull and make a small caudal incision starting at the level of the intraparietal bone. Avoid cutting through the brain.\nCut firmly through the most anterior part of the skull between the eyes to ease brain removal. Tilt one side of the parietal bone using curved narrow pattern forceps and break off. Repeat the last step for the other side.",
    "Remove the brain meninges. Slide a spatula under the anterior part of the brain (i.e., the olfactory bulb) and tilt the brain gently upward. Slide the spatula further down to break the optic and other cranial nerves.\nLift the brain out of the skull and snap freeze the whole brain immediately on a precooled (-80 °C) metal plate with the ventral side facing the metal plate (dorsal up).\nAllow the brains to completely freeze and transfer into precooled 5 mL tubes and store at -80 °C until the dissection of the brain regions or the punching procedure (see steps 3.1. and 3.2).\nPerform plasma sampling.\n\t\t\nSpike precooled EDTA-tubes with 10 µL of freshly prepared indomethacin-dilution to a target concentration of 10 µM.\nCollect the trunk blood immediately after decapitation by gentle squeezing of the body into precooled EDTA tubes to a maximum blood volume of 1 mL.\n\t\t\tNOTE: In case of proper blood pressure, squeezing is not required. If blood volume is less than 1 mL, decrease the isoflurane incubation time to enable proper blood flow.\nImmediately centrifuge blood tubes at 2,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\nRemove the resulting upper plasma phase and for the purpose of multilipid analysis aliquot defined plasma volumes in precooled 2 mL tubes as follows: 50 µL for eCBs/eiCs analysis, 30 µL for PLs analysis, and the remaining plasma volume as the backup sample or for other types of analysis.\nStore the plasma samples at -80 °C for further extraction (see steps 4.1.2 and 4.1.4).\nPerform peripheral organ sampling.\n\t\tNOTE: Use mouse anatomy references16 and documentation provided for the obligatory courses (FELASA) attended by animal investigators to identify the individual organs, their connective tissues, and/or blood vessels.",
    "Immobilize the mouse torso to ease organ removal using needles. Make a ventral midline incision using a straight sharp scissor at the height of the pubis. Use blunt standard forceps to fixate the abdominal wall while cutting to open the abdominal cavity.\nImmobilize the skin to allow abdominal organ removal using blunt forceps. For heart or lung removal, continue medial cut in the direction of the breast cave. Remove the lung and/or heart using fine forceps.\nOpen the breast cavity carefully to avoid bleeding. Cut the connective tissues and blood vessels anchoring the respective organ without cutting through the organ.\nTransfer tissue pieces immediately on precooled metal plates (-80 °C) and allow to completely freeze. Transfer tissue pieces to precooled tubes and store at -80 °C for further processing (see step 4.1).\n3. Biological material processing\nNOTE: For co-extraction of eCBs/eiCs use 2 mL amber tubes as extraction tubes and add in each tube seven precooled steel balls. For co-extraction of PLs/eCBs and for dual lipid and RNA co-extraction, use 2 mL of RNAse-free extraction tubes spiked with ceramic beads (Table of Materials).\nPerform brain dissection and peripheral organ processing.\n\tNOTE: Use magnifying lamps to increase the visibility of the brain for dissection.\n\t\nClean the surgical tools, including the forceps with super fine tips, 2x with 70% ethanol.\nTransfer the frozen brains from -80 °C to a Petri dish containing precooled physiological buffer (pH 5.5) Ensure the Petri dish is at 4 °C. Allow brains to completely unfreeze to allow dissection. Test carefully using forceps.\n\t\tCAUTION: Do not keep brains at 4 °C longer than required for thawing.",
    "Precool a metal plate on ice (4 °C) and cover it with wet tissues soaked in ice-cold physiological buffer (pH 5.5) and transfer the brain with ventral side up carefully onto a precooled (4 °C) metal plate on ice. Cover it with wet tissues soaked in ice-cold physiological buffer (pH 5.5).\nDissect brain regions within a maximum of 5 min using super fine tip forceps. Start with the hypothalamus (HYP) and turn the dorsal side up to proceed with the right side. Isolate the hippocampus (HCr), prefrontal cortex (PFCr), striatum (STRr), and cerebral cortex (cCTXr). Then dissect the left side. Isolate the hippocampus (HCl), prefrontal cortex (PFCl), striatum (STRl), and cerebral cortex (cCTXl). Dissect the cerebellum and the thalamic region. Use published anatomical references16,17 for brain region identification.\nTransfer each dissected piece directly on an aluminum foil-covered, precooled metal plate (-80 °C). Allow freezing and transfer the isolated brain regions in the labeled precooled 2 mL tubes.\nPulverize the tissue pieces using a tissue pulverizer (at -80 °C), avoiding the thawing of the tissue. In the cold room, aliquot tissue powder in labeled, precooled extraction tubes containing ceramic beads or steel balls. For the dual lipidomics/transcriptomics analysis, weigh the tissue powder aliquots in the cold room. For lipidomics-only analysis, choose between normalization to the tissue weight or protein content. For the latter, proceed further without tissue weighing.\nCut the peripheral organ tissues in pieces with a maximum weight of 20 mg. Proceed with tissue pulverization as in step 3.1.6.\nProceed with the extraction of tissue samples (see steps 4.1.1, 4.1.3, or 4.1.5) or store tubes at -80 °C for later extraction.",
    "NOTE: The brain matrix can also be used if the study design permits. However, the method is more suitable for a discrete and limited number of brain regions, and it is not practical to dissect and isolate all of the above-mentioned brain regions within the set time-frame.\nPerform brain punching.\n\t\nMount the whole, frozen brains onto the mounting system (Table of Materials) in the cryostat. Set the thickness to 50 µm and slice in trim-mode close to the region of interest.\nStain brain slice (18−20 µm) using toluidine blue (0.1%−1%) as a reference to localize the subregion of interest. Inspect the stained slices using a microscope to identify the regions of interest to be punched. Use a mouse atlas as reference to find the appropriate brain anatomical regions16. Take punches with a 0.8−1.0 mm diameter using sample corers in precooled tubes.\nWeigh frozen punches in the cold room in labeled, precooled 2 mL extraction tubes containing ceramic beads or steel balls. Use amber tubes for eCBs and eiCs co-extraction.\nStart the extraction (see steps 4.1.1, 4.1.3, or 4.1.5) or store tubes at -80 °C for further extraction.\nPerform plasma processing.\n\t\nPlace the frozen plasma samples on ice (4 °C) and let them thaw (~20 min).\nEnsure that the plasma is entirely unfrozen before starting extraction.\nProceed with the plasma extraction procedure (see steps 4.1.2 or 4.1.4).\n\t\tNOTE: Plasma samples should remain at -80 °C until extraction. Avoid cycles of thawing and refreezing.\n4. Extraction procedures\nCarry out Liquid-Liquid (LLE) lipid co-extraction protocols.\n\t\nPerform co-extraction of eCBs and eiCs from brain pieces, punches, or tissue powder samples.\n\t\tNOTE: Accurate pipetting is required throughout the procedure.",
