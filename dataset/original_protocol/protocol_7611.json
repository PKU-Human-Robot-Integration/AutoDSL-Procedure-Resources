    "This protocol consists of three main parts: 1) the design of the stamp to create the imprint in the gel, 2) the protocol for culture in the device including cell        isolation, gel preparation, building the agarose co-culture, and imaging, and 3)        suggestions for interaction studies after imaging.The design of the stamp to create the imprint in the agarose gel Before the start of this protocol, make sure to 3D print the stamp needed to make the imprint in the agarose gel (Figure        1). The stamping device was 3D-printed in the material PlasGray (Asiga) with        an Asiga Max X 27 3D printer (Asiga) with a layer height of 50 μM. The stamp        includes holes to prevent air bubble formation during stamping in the agarose gel.        The STL file is provided in the supplementary materials and on the SciLifeLab        FigShare website DOI: 10.17044/scilifelab.24073062.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4852/bioprotoc-13-20-4852-g001.jpgFigure 1.

(C) Side view from the device including            measurements: height of the part that stays on the dish during stamping (3            mm), height of the stamp that fits in the dish (10 mm), and the depth of the            stamp (0.5 mm). (D) Tilted view of the stamp.",
    "Protocol for the co-culture including cell isolation, gel preparation,          building the co-culture, and imaging Isolation and culturing of sympathetic neurons Isolate superior cervical ganglia from DsRed pups (maximum three days                old) as described in Jackson’s protocol “Neuron Culture                from Mouse Superior Cervical Ganglion” (Jackson and Tourtellotte, 2014), followed by                neuron isolation from the ganglia as described below.Note: Steps A2–A6 are adapted from Jackson and Tourtellotte (2014)                  . Place superior cervical ganglia into a 50 mL tube with ~200 μL                collagenase A (10 mg/mL) for a single ganglia (use 400 μL for                four ganglia) for 30 min in a 37 °C water bath and agitate every                10 min.Remove the collagenase solution by carefully pipetting around the                ganglia. Replace with approximately 200 μL of 0.25% trypsin for                1–2 ganglia (use 500 μL for four ganglia). Place in 37                °C water bath for 15 min and agitate approximately every 5 min.Note: The 50 mL tube can be swirled to bring ganglia                  together in the middle of the tube. Add 1 mL of neurobasal media to inactivate trypsin and remove both                media and trypsin by aspirating media around the ganglia.Rinse ganglia three times in 1 mL of neuron medium (see Recipes).Re-suspend ganglia in 200 μL of neuron medium and pipette up and                down with barrier tips of 200 μL until the ganglia are no longer                visible (~60–70 times).Use a cell counter (counting chamber) to determine cell number. One                ganglion yields approximately 35–40,000 cells.Dilute neurons to 6,000 neurons/100 μL in neuron medium. Seed                3,000 neurons in droplets of 50 μL per 12 mm PLL/laminin-coated                glass coverslip and place in incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2).",
    "After one hour, check with a brightfield microscope if the cells are                attached to the coverslip and carefully add an additional 450 μL                of pre-warmed neuron medium supplemented with NGF (10 ng/mL) using                the side wall of the plate (to not disturb the cells).Note: In case the neurons are not attached after 2 h, the                  cells are probably not viable and should not be used. Culture neurons in incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) with                medium changes every two days. To not disturb the cells, half of the                neuron medium can be changed each time.Note: Since only half of the medium is changed, the added                  NGF should be doubled (add 250 μL with 20 ng/mL NGF per well                  to reach a concentration of 10 ng/mL in the full 500 μL. For                  medium change, tilt the plate at an angle towards you to collect                  the medium in the bottom and add new medium along the wall of                  the plate to limit disturbance of the cells. Neurons are ready to be used for co-culture after four days and can                be kept in culture for 28 days (Figure 2A).Make and stamp agarose gel Warm up 40 mL of islet medium to 37 °C (see Recipes).Weigh 0.48 g of agarose in a small Erlenmeyer flask (see also agarose                gel recipe).Note: We recommend using normal agarose to prevent the gel                  from melting during imaging. Add 10 mL of autoclaved Milli-Q water to the agarose in a laminar                flow hood.Cover the Erlenmeyer flask with parafilm and heat it up in the                microwave until agarose is completely dissolved.Back in the hood, add 30 mL of pre-warmed 37 °C medium. Mix                medium and dissolved agarose together by swirling and pipetting.Pipet 4 mL of agarose-medium mix into a 6 cm dish, resulting in an                approximately 5 mm thick layer.",
    "Note: The pipette tip can be placed against the wall to                  prevent air bubble formation. Wait until the gel starts to set (approximately 5–10 min).Place the stamp on the set gel in the dish and apply light pressure                for 10 s to make an imprint in the gel. Remove any remaining gel                from the stamp with an ethanol-drenched tissue and quickly continue                to the next one (Figure 2B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4852/bioprotoc-13-20-4852-g002.jpgFigure 2.

(F) Picture of an islet in the                      co-culture model including brightfield to visualize all                      cells, GFP to visualize the islet, and Ds-Red to                      visualize the neurons. (G) Imaging setup of the                      co-culture. (H) Picture of the live imaging using the                      488 laser to visualize the islet (indicated with white                      dotted line) and 512 to visualize the Ds-Red neurons.Let the gel set for an additional 10 min at room temperature without                the lid to fully solidify (Figure 2C).Continue to use the gel for the co-culture or put the lid back on and                wrap the plate with parafilm before storage at 4 °C.Collect pancreatic islets from a GFP mouse Islets were isolated from a global GFP-expressing mouse as described                elsewhere (Bohman et al., 2006).After isolating using the gradient, hand pick the islets using a                stereomicroscope.Collect eight islets per well in a 96-well U-bottom plate in islet                medium and keep in the incubator until ready for seeding (section                E).",
    "Isolate macrophages For macrophages in the co-culture: isolate and grow bone                marrow–derived macrophages as described previously in Haag and Murthy (2021).Collect macrophages from a 10 cm dish using a cell scraper.If not using macrophages expressing fluorescent protein: stain the                macrophages with violet or far red dye cell tracer according to                manufacturer’s instructions.Count macrophages and dilute to 100,000 cells/μL in co-culture                medium.Seed GFP-islets and macrophages in the gel Place the 6 cm dish containing the imprinted agarose gel (from                section A) in a laminar flow hood.Spin down the plate with islets (200 g, 2 min) and remove the medium                in the hood. Resuspend islets in 10 μL of islet medium per well.Let the islets sink to the lower part of the pipette tip and inject 5                μL of medium with islets into the middle circle of the gel.Check if the placement was successful using a brightfield microscope.Proceed with seeding 1 μL of macrophages per seeding point (three                in total).Note: Turn off lights in the hood and use a small light from                  the side for better visibility of the seeding points. Check if macrophages are in the seeding points and have spread into                the crescents by the capillary effect (Figure 2D).Note: In case the macrophages do not spread into the                  crescents, it will not be possible to identify the exact                  starting location. However, it will still be possible to image                  interactions between neurons, islets, and macrophages. Add 200 μL of liquid low melting 1.2% agarose gel on top to seal                islets and macrophages in (see Recipes or section B).Quickly add coverslip containing neurons on top of the new gel, so                that it is located above the islets.Put droplets of low-melting agarose gel on the sides of the glass                slide to make sure the coverslip will stay in place (Figure 2E).",
    "Check location of cells and islets in the gel using a brightfield                and/or fluorescence microscope.Add 4 mL of co-culture medium (see Recipes) and put the dish in the                incubator.Change co-culture medium every two days. For medium changes, the                complete medium can be pipetted off and replaced with new co-culture                medium.At this stage, stimulants/inhibitors can be added to the medium at                any time.Cells in co-culture can be checked using brightfield or fluorescence                microscopes (Figure                2F).Start imaging after day six to provide the neurons with enough time                to reach the islet (Figure 2F).Imaging of co-culture with neurons, pancreatic islets, and macrophages Check and mark location of islets and interesting spots, such as                macrophages or islets.Start up the microscope and heating device.Place the co-culture in the heating device under the microscope (Figure 2G).Use brightfield or GFP signal to find the islets.Set the microscope to capture immune cells (violet), pancreatic                islets (GFP), and neurons (DsRed).Set Z-stack capturing the full islet. Immune cells and neurons might                be slightly below or above the islet, so check their location and                include them in the Z stack if wanted.Start imaging. For our experiments, we imaged every 2 min during 30                min per islet with a Z slice size of 1–2 μm (depending on                the size of the islet) (Figure 2H).Note: Keep an eye on the fluid levels in the dish during                  imaging and add more medium if necessary to keep the connection                  between the objective and the fluid in the dish. If using sterile imaging in a temperature-controlled chamber, the                co-culture could be followed over time by keeping it in a tissue                culture incubator and re-image on the required timepoints.",
    "Suggestions for interaction studies after imaging To study the interactions in the islet area further after imaging,                the islets could be cut out of the gel using a stereomicroscope and                scalpel. The gel containing islets can be fixed in 4% PFA overnight                at 4 °C and used for additional fluorescent staining.                Alternatively, it would even be possible to remove the agarose and                use the isolated cells for flow cytometry, qPCR, or single-cell RNA                sequencing."
