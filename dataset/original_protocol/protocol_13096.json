    "1. hPSC culture and maintenance\nNOTE: The human induced PSCs (hiPSCs) or human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) need to be cultured for at least 2 consecutive passages after thawing before being used to generate EBs for differentiation or further cryopreservation. hPSCs are cultured in PSC medium (see the Table of Materials) on basement-membrane-extracellular matrix (BM-ECM)-coated 6-well culture plates. When performing medium changes on hPSCs in 6-well plates, add the medium directly to the inner side of the well rather than directly on top of the cells to prevent unwanted cell detachment or stress. Users should be wary of pre-warming PSC media that should not be warmed at 37 °C; all PSC media used in this protocol were thermostable.\nTo coat the well-plates with the BM-ECM, thaw one aliquot of the BM-ECM (stored at -20 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions) on ice and mix 0.5 mg of the BM-ECM with 12 mL of cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F12 medium (stored at 4 °C). Distribute 2 mL of the DMEM/F12-BM-ECM mixture onto each well of a 6-well plate and incubate at 37 °C for at least 2 h.",
    "To thaw the cells, first, thaw the hPSC cryovial in a 37 °C bead or water bath for 1-2 min until only a small amount of ice is visible. Transfer the thawed cells to a centrifuge tube and slowly add 8-9 mL of the PSC medium supplemented with 2 µM of the ROCK inhibitor, thiazovivin (Thiaz), and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in the PSC medium supplemented with 2 µM of Thiaz. Distribute the cells in the culture medium into 1-2 wells depending on the cryovial cell concentration and culture at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h before changing the PSC medium.\nChange the medium on the cells at 48 h intervals. Perform washes and medium changes using DMEM/F12 (1 mL/well) and the PSC medium (2 mL/well), respectively.\n\tNOTE: Washes help remove cell waste and debris while fresh media changes provide cells with a renewed source of nutrients.\nPassage the cells upon subconfluency (60-80% confluent) by aspirating the medium, then washing each well with 1 mL of 1x Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered solution (no calcium, no magnesium; DPBS). Aspirate the DPBS and add 1 mL of the dissociation reagent for hPSCs (see the Table of Materials), followed by the aspiration of all but a thin film of the reagent after 10 s.\nIncubate for 2-5 min with the thin film of the dissociation reagent for hPSCs until gaps form between cells.\n\tNOTE: The time to stop the dissociation is cell-line-dependent.",
    "Add 1 mL of the PSC medium supplemented with 2 µM of Thiaz (PSC medium+Thiaz) to the well and gently tap the plate to induce cell detachment. Pipette the detached cells in the medium 1-2 times to break up any large colonies, and resuspend the cells in PSC medium+Thiaz in a 1:6 well ratio (cells from 1 well resuspended in 12 mL of culture medium). Replate the cells on BM-ECM-coated wells.\n2. Generation of 3D self-assembling human heart organoids\nEmbryoid body (EB) formation:\n\tNOTE: It is imperative to limit observable differentiated cells prior to embryoid body formation. Two to three wells of a 6-well plate at a 60-80% confluency will yield enough cells for a single 96-well plate of organoids. All media should be aliquoted and warmed in a 37 °C bead or water bath before any medium changes to minimize temperature shock to the EBs or organoids (this does not include cell dissociation reagents). See Figure 1A,B.\n\t\nDay -2\n\t\t\nTo create EBs, on day -2, wash sub-confluent hPSCs (60-80% confluent) with DPBS for at least 10 s to wash any cell debris and aspirate the DPBS.\nTo detach the cells and release them into a single-cell state, add 1 mL of room-temperature cell dissociation reagent (see the Table of Materials) to each well for 3-6 min. Gently tap the plate ~5 times every minute to induce detachment while checking under the microscope. Add 1 mL of PSC medium+Thiaz to stop the reaction.\nTo collect the cells and break up any remaining aggregates, pipette the media up and down in the well 2-3 times to generate a single-cell suspension. Transfer the single-cell suspension to a centrifuge tube and spin for 5 min at 300 × g.",
    "To obtain the desired cell concentration, discard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1 mL of PSC medium+Thiaz. Count the cells using a cell counter or hemocytometer and dilute the cells in PSC medium+Thiaz to a concentration of 100,000 cells/mL.\nTo distribute the cells for EB formation, use a multichannel pipette to add 100 µL (10,000 cells) to each well of a round-bottom ultra-low attachment 96-well plate. Centrifuge the plate at 100 × g for 3 min and incubate for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nDay -1\n\t\t\nCarefully remove 50 µL of medium from each well and add 200 µL of fresh PSC medium warmed to 37 °C to achieve a final volume of 250 µL per well. Incubate the cells for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Remove and add medium carefully on the side of the well to avoid disturbing the EBs at the bottom of the well. Due to the delicate nature of the EBs and the suspension culture, it is necessary to leave a small volume of liquid in each well when changing the medium to avoid disturbing the EBs.\nHuman Heart Organoid (hHO) Differentiation:\n\tNOTE: All media should be warmed in a 37 °C bead or water bath prior to any media changes. Remove and add medium carefully on the side of the well to avoid disturbing the developing organoids at the bottom of the well. Washes are not needed between media changes to minimize agitation and allow the gradual removal of inhibitors and growth factors. RPMI with 2% B-27 supplement (Table of Materials) was used throughout the differentiation protocol. B-27 supplement contains insulin unless specified (insulin-free in days 0-5). See Figure 1C.\n\t\nDay 0",
    "To initiate differentiation towards a mesoderm lineage, remove 166 µL of medium from each well (~2/3rd of total well volume) and add 166 µL of RPMI 1640 containing insulin-free B-27 supplement, 6 µM CHIR99021, 1.875 ng/mL bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), and 1.5 ng/mL Activin A for a final well concentration of 4 µM CHIR99021, 1.25 ng/mL BMP4, and 1 ng/mL Activin A. Incubate for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nDay 1\n\t\t\nRemove 166 µL of medium from each well and add 166 µL of fresh RPMI 1640 with insulin-free B-27 supplement. Incubate for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nDay 2\n\t\t\nTo induce cardiac mesoderm specification, remove 166 µL of medium from each well and add 166 µL of RPMI 1640 containing insulin-free B-27 supplement and 3 µM Wnt-C59 for a final well concentration of 2 µM Wnt-C59. Incubate for 48 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nDay 4\n\t\t\nRemove 166 µL of medium from each well and add 166 µL of fresh RPMI 1640 with insulin-free B-27 supplement. Incubate for 48 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nDay 6\n\t\t\nRemove 166 µL of medium from each well and add 166 µL of RPMI 1640 with B-27 supplement. Incubate for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nDay 7\n\t\t\nTo induce proepicardial differentiation, remove 166 µL of medium from each well and add 166 µL of fresh RPMI 1640 containing B-27 supplement and 3 µM CHIR99021 for a final well concentration of 2 µM CHIR99021. Incubate for 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nRemove 166 µL of medium from each well and add 166 µL of fresh RPMI 1640 containing B-27 supplement. Incubate for 48 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.",
    "NOTE: Extra caution is advised at this second medium change on day 7 as the organoids are more prone to movement because of the media changes.\nFrom day 7 onwards until collection or transfer for analyses or experimentation, perform medium changes every 48 h by removing 166 µL of medium from each well and add 166 µL of fresh RPMI 1640 containing B-27 supplement.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: Organoids are ready for analyses and experimentation at day 15 unless earlier developmental stages are of interest. They can be cultured past day 15 for long-term culture or maturation experiments.\n3. Organoid analysis\nTransferring whole organoids (live or fixed)\n\tNOTE: For live organoid transfer, ensure that pipette tips used are sterile.\n\t\nCut the tip off a P200 pipette tip 5-10 mm from the tip opening, resulting in a wide opening of ~2-3 mm diameter.\nInsert the tip straight into the round-bottom well containing the organoid so that the pipette is completely vertical (perpendicular to the plate). Ensure that the pipette plunger is already pressed all the way before inserting the tip into the medium.\nSlowly release the pipette plunger, taking up enough medium (100-200 µL) to collect the organoid.\nTransfer the organoid in medium to the target destination (e.g., for fixing, live imaging, electrophysiology recording, new plate culture).\nFixing organoids\n\tNOTE: Fixing and staining organoids can be done either in the 96-well culture plate or microcentrifuge tubes. Paraformaldehyde (PFA) should be handled only in a fume hood.\n\t\nFor fixation in microcentrifuge tubes, transfer live organoids to separate tubes with 1-8 organoids per tube.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not exceed 8 organoids per tube.\nCarefully remove and discard as much medium from the tube as possible without touching the organoids.",
    "Add 4% PFA to each tube or well (300-400 µL per microcentrifuge tube and 100-200 µL per well of a 96-well plate). Incubate at room temperature for 30-45 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Incubation times over 1 h may require antigen retrieval steps and are not recommended.\nSafely discard the PFA without disturbing the organoids. Perform 3 washes with DPBS supplemented with 1.5 g/L glycine (DPBS/Gly), using the same volume used for the 4% PFA, waiting 5 min between washes. Remove DPBS/Gly and proceed to immunostaining or other analyses or add DPBS and store at 4 °C for future use for up to 2 weeks.\n\t\tNOTE: Storing fixed organoids for longer than 2 weeks may result in tissue degradation and contamination and is not recommended.\nWhole-mount immunofluorescent staining\n\t\nAdd 100 µL of blocking/permeabilization solution (10% normal donkey serum + 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) + 0.5% Triton X-100 in 1x DPBS) to each well or tube containing the fixed organoids. Incubate at room temperature overnight on a shaker.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not exceed 8 organoids per tube.\nCarefully remove and discard as much of the blocking solution as possible without touching the organoids. Perform 3 washes with DPBS, waiting 5 min between washes.\nPrepare the primary antibody solution (1% normal donkey serum + 0.5% BSA + 0.5% Triton X-100 in 1x DPBS) with the desired primary antibodies at the recommended concentrations. Incubate at 4 °C for 24 h on a shaker.\nCarefully remove and discard as much of the antibody solution as possible without touching the organoids. Perform 3 washes with DPBS, waiting 5 min between washes.",
    "Prepare secondary antibody solution (1% normal donkey serum + 0.5% BSA + 0.5% Triton X-100 in 1x DPBS) with the desired secondary antibodies at the recommended concentrations. If the antibodies are fluorescently labeled, incubate at 4 °C in the dark (e.g., covered in aluminum foil) for 24 h on a shaker.\nCarefully remove and discard as much of the antibody solution as possible without touching the organoids. Perform 3 washes with DPBS, waiting 5 min between washes.\nPrepare slides with beads (90-300 µm in diameter) mounted in a mounting medium (see the Table of Materials) near the edges of the slide where the coverslip with the organoids will be placed.\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to allow the mounting medium around the beads to dry before proceeding; this will prevent the beads from moving around. See Figure 2.\nTransfer the stained organoids using a cut pipette tip onto the slide, between the beads, ensuring spacing to avoid contact between the organoids once on the slide. Use the corner of a rolled-up laboratory wipe to carefully remove excess liquid around the organoid.\nCover the organoids with mounting-clearing medium (fructose-glycerol clearing solution is 60% (vol/vol) glycerol and 2.5 M fructose)37 using 120-150 µL of the mounting-clearing medium per slide.\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to use a cut pipette tip when working with the mounting-clearing medium as it is very viscous.\nHover the coverslip over the slide with the organoids covered with mounting-clearing solution and slowly press the coverslip over the slide, ensuring the organoids are between the mounted beads.\nSeal the perimeter of the coverslip on the slide using top coat nail varnish. Allow the slide to dry in the dark at room temperature for 1 h. Store at 4 °C in the dark for long-term storage.",
    "Calcium transient imaging in live heart organoids\n\tNOTE: According to the manufacturer's instructions, Fluo4-AM was reconstituted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a final stock solution concentration of 0.5 mM. Fluo4-AM was added directly to the organoid well in the 96-well plate.\n\t\nPerform 2 washes on the organoids using RPMI 1640 medium.\n\t\t\nRemove 166 µL of the spent medium from the well.\nAdd 166 µL of warmed RPMI 1640 medium, remove 166 µL of medium, and add 166 µL of fresh RPMI 1640 medium.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The washes are done to remove waste material and cell debris. Two-thirds of the medium is removed from the wells during the washes to avoid disturbing the organoids at the bottom of the well before the functional assay.\nAdd Fluo4-AM medium to the organoids.\n\t\t\nAdd Fluo4-AM reconstituted in DMSO to RPMI 1640 containing B-27 supplement to prepare a 1.5 µM solution.\nRemove 166 µL of medium from the well.\nAdd 166 µL of 1.5 µM Fluo4-AM in RPMI 1640 containing B-27 supplement for a final well concentration of 1 µM. Incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 30 min.\nPerform 2 washes as in step 3.4.1.\nAdd 166 µL of RPMI 1640 containing B-27 supplement to the well.\nUsing a cut tip of a P200 pipette tip, transfer the organoid to a glass-bottom Petri dish (e.g., 8-well chambered cover glass with #1.5 high-performance coverglass) with 100-200 µL of medium.\n\t\tNOTE: See section 3.1 on transferring whole organoids.\nImage the organoids live under a microscope with a temperature- and CO2-controlled chamber at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nRecord several 10-20 s videos at various locations across the organoid, showing the increase and decrease in fluorescence intensity levels as the calcium enters and exits the cells.",
    "NOTE: For high-resolution recordings, it is recommended to record at a speed of 10 fps or faster; 50 fps is recommended.\nAnalyze the videos using image analysis software (e.g., ImageJ) by selecting regions of interest and measuring intensity levels over time.\nNormalize the intensity recordings using ΔF/F0 vs. time in milliseconds and plot.\nSubscription Required.
