    "The procedure was reviewed and approved by the Clinical Research and Application Ethics Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University. The content and methods of the research are in line with medical ethics norms and requirements. The patient was informed of the purpose, background, process, risks, and benefits of the study prior to surgery. The patient understood that participation in this study was voluntary and signed informed consent.\n1. Patient positioning, instruments, and port placement\nPlace the patient in the supine and 30° reverse Trendelenburg position on the operating table, and subsequently tilt 30° to the right during the procedure, with the surgeon performing from the right side.\nUse the five-port technique during the procedure, with three 10 mm trocars, one 5 mm trocar, and one 12 mm trocar for retraction and specimen retrieval. Then, assemble the following hemostatic devices: 30° laparoscope, laparoscopic ultrasonography device, and basic laparoscopic instruments, including a single lumen catheter, a harmonic scalpel, a monopole electrocoagulator, a vascular clip, and a powered endoscopic cutter stapler (see Table of Materials).\nAdminister the patient a combination of intravenous and inhalation anesthesia by giving propofol 150 mg, sufentanil 15 ug, and rocuronium bromide 50 mg intravenously, followed by endotracheal intubation 7.5 F after 90 s.\n\tNOTE: The selection of the anesthetic agents and the application of intravenous and inhalation anesthesia are decided and performed by the anesthetist on a case-to-case basis.\n\t\nDuring the parenchymal transection, lower the central venous pressure by 3-5 cm H2O to reduce hepatic venous bleeding while limiting the fluid replacement as much as possible. Place a lumen catheter and nasogastric tube (see Table of Materials) in the bladder and stomach for urinary volume recording and decompression.",
    "Routinely place a preoperative arterial line and a central venous (internal jugular vein) catheter. Use a 10 mm trocar for the observation port 2 cm below the umbilicus. Then, establish pneumoperitoneum by insufflating carbon dioxide, and maintain the intra-abdominal pressure at 12-14 mmHg (1 mmHg, 1/4 0.133 kPa).\nPlace the other four trocars in the following locations: the 5 mm trocar in the right anterior axillary line, the 12 mm trocar in the right midclavicular line under the costal margin, the 10 mm trocar in the left anterior axillary line, and the 10 mm trocar in the left midclavicular line under the costal margin (Figure 2).\n2. Surgical technique\nPull the fundus of the gallbladder upward, and use a harmonic scalpel (see Table of Materials) for Calot's triangle18 dissociation. Take care to ligate the cystic duct and artery with medium-sized hemostatic clips, do not cut the gallbladder, and leave the gallbladder in situ primarily (Figure 3).\nSegment the round and falciform ligaments with the harmonic scalpel. Separate the left coronary and triangular ligaments carefully, avoiding injury to the adjacent phrenic vein branches (Figure 4). Then, incisethe hepatogastric ligaments medially 10 mm into the lesser sac.\nAccess from left to right behind the hepatoduodenal ligament through a sling removed from the attached 14 F single-lumen catheter to prepare for hepatic inflow occlusion (Figure 5).\nAfter ligating the left hepatic artery with medium-sized vascular clips, ensure that the first porta hepatis has been blocked with the single-lumen catheter to prevent unexpected bleeding during the mobilization of the left hepatic pedicle.",
    "Gently lift the inferior edge of the liver, free the left Glissonean pedicles by the gap of the Laennec membrane19 and Hilar plate20 (Figure 6), and then prepare a tourniquet system to block the left hepatic inflow by inserting an 8 F single lumen catheter through the left Glissonean pedicle21 (Figure 7).\nAfter releasing the first porta hepatis, block the left hepatic pedicle by clamping the single lumen catheter with a hemostatic clip (Figure 8), which will be stapled after parenchyma transection. Determine the border between the left and right hepatic lobes by identifying ischemia of the left hepatic lobe.\n\t\nFollowing the dividing line, seek and mark the projection positions of the middle hepatic veins with laparoscopic ultrasonography. Pay attention to mapping the location and trajectories of the vital intrahepatic vessels, especially those located on the expected transverse plane of the liver parenchyma (Figure 9).\n\t\tNOTE: In this study, the ultrasound was set to color Doppler flow image (CDFI) mode, and the thin-walled vessel flowing into the inferior vena cava in the same direction as the long axis of the ultrasound probe was judged to be the MHV. Moreover, it was also located near the dividing line.\nMark the parenchymal transection line with an electric hook along the demarcation line on the liver surface (Figure 10). Ask the assistant to drag the fundus of the gallbladder and transect the parenchyma from the foot side to the head side along the middle hepatic vein using an ultrasonic scalpel (Figure 11).\n\t\nTrigger the ultrasonic scalpel early to effectively reduce hepatic parenchymal bleeding, and do not clamp the tip of the scalpel to avoid vessel damage. Secure or suture the large intrahepatic vessels and bile ducts found during the parenchymal resection with 2-0 sutures if necessary.",
    "Expose the vascular pedicles inflowing into segments 4a/4b and the left hepatic vein further up in the cutting line (Figure 12). Then, expose the whole MHV and its tributaries fully, and dissect the roots of the LHV and MHV later (Figure 13). Lastly, staple the inflow and outflow vessels with the powered plus stapler when exposed.\nOnce the liver specimens have been isolated from the remaining right hepatic lobe, conduct a hemostasis and bile leakage examination along the cut surface before suturing.\n\t\nUse monopole electrocoagulation (see Table of Materials) for hemostasis when bleeding spots are found on the cut surface (Figure 14). Wrap the resected left hepatic lobe (Figure 15) in a plastic bag, and take it out through a 4 cm long incision in the lower abdomen, followed by the placement of two drainage tubes.\n3. Postoperative nursing\nOn the first postoperative day, discontinue the nasogastric tube, and give the patient a liquid diet.\nRemove the Foley catheter on postoperative day 2, and assist the patient in getting out of bed for daily activities.\nFinally, when the drainage is less than 50 mL per day, remove the two drainage tubes on the fourth and fifth days, respectively. Ask the patient to return to the hospital for a follow-up examination 1 month later.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
