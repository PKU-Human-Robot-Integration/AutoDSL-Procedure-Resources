    "1. von Frey baseline measurements prior to surgery\nFor von Frey testing procedure, please refer to section 5.\n2. Anesthesia/preparation\nAnesthetize the animals (intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of 100mg/kg ketamine and 15 mg/kg Xylazine).\nPlace the animal in a quiet place until fully anesthetized (e.g. covered with a paper towel).\nCheck reflexes by pinching the tip of the tail and the paws with a pair of tweezers. Be sure that the animals are unresponsive before proceeding.\nSubcutaneously inject (back shoulder area) 0.5ml isotonic saline with antibiotics, e.g. ampicillin (to avoid dehydration and prevent infection, although this is a minor surgical procedure).\nUsing an electrical shaver, shave the operative field from slightly below the knee area to the hip area (for right-handed persons the left hind limb is recommended).\nApply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes with a cotton-wool bud.\nPlace the animal on its right side and place the left hindlimb on a small platform to keep it elevated. Secure the leg with adhesive tape.\nDisinfect the operative field with alternating scrubs of ethanol and betadine from surgical site out.\n3. Surgery\nLocate the knee with the thumb of your left hand and use a scalpel to make an app. 1 cm incision in the longitudinal direction proximal to the knee.\nOpen the skin by blunt dissection using the tip of a pair of sterile scissors.\nSeparate the muscle layer by blunt dissection right next to the clearly visible blood vessel, close to the thigh bone (femur). If done correctly, the muscle layers will easily separate without any bleeding, revealing the sciatic nerve right below the muscles.\n\tIf bleeding occurs e.g. by damage to a blood vessel close to the knee, use sterile cotton-wool buds or pieces of gaze to absorb the blood. Press until the bleeding stops.",
    "Place the mouse under a stereo microscope and carefully separate the muscles with a pair of sterile tweezers (nr. 2) to visualize the sciatic nerve. Retractors may also be applied.\nIdentify the area where the sural nerve branches from the sciatic nerve. The sural nerve is the smallest of the three branches, branching to the right in the left leg.\nApply suture (6-0 suture) around the other two branches which are still running in parallel (the tibial and common peroneal nerves), being very careful not to touch the sural branch. This is a critical step as the sural nerve has to be left completely intact.\nMake a tight surgical knot. If the first knot is tight, contractions of the limb will be observed.\nGrab the nerves to be cut below the suture with a pair of tweezers (nr. 5) and cut the nerves above and below tweezers with a small pair of scissors. By first cutting above the pair of tweezers, pulling of the nerves is avoided.\nCut off suture ends with a pair of micro scissors and gently close the muscle layer. Add a drop of lidocaine to the wound and suture with surgical knots.\n4. After surgery\nCheck if eye ointment is still sufficient.\nPlace the mouse in a clean cage under a paper towel in a comfortable posture. If the room is cold, place a heat pad under a part of the cage (only under part of \n\tthe cage as the animal should be able to escape to a colder area if preferred).\nEnsure easily accessible water and chow.\n5. von Frey testing (baseline, and from the day after surgery)",
    "Place the mice in red colored plastic cylinders placed on a wire mesh table two days and one day prior to surgery. Habituate for 15 min in cylinders prior to \n\ttesting. The red color of the cylinders helps the mice to quickly relax as they cannot see each other and are in a darker area.\nVerify that the mice are calm and apply von Frey filaments to the lateral part of the paw: Starting with the 0.02 g filament, first apply force to the left paw \n\tfive times over a total period of 30 seconds (approximately 2 seconds per stimulus) and gauge the mouse's reaction after each application. Repeat with the same \n\tfilament and the left paw of any other mice, and then start over again with the right paw of the first mouse before moving on to the next filament, e.g.:\nMouse 1: left paw 5 times with filament 0.02 g\nMouse 2: left paw 5 times with filament 0.02 g etc.\nMouse 1: right paw 5 times with filament 0.02 g\nMouse 2: right paw 5 times with filament 0.02 g etc.\nMouse 1: left paw 5 times with filament 0.04 g\nMouse 2: left paw 5 times with filament 0.04 g etc.\nResponse in three out of five stimuli is regarded as a positive reaction. Filaments above threshold can be applied to verify the threshold level.\n\tResponse = sudden paw withdrawal, sudden flinching, sudden paw licking.\n6. Representative results\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3092/3092fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Von Frey testing on C57BL/6 mice age 8-10 weeks old was performed 1 day prior to operation and repeatedly following surgery. 4-8 \nanimals were included in each group. Von Frey testing on the operated side is represented by ipsilateral and the non-operated control side is",
    "represented by contralateral. The day after surgery the animals develop significant hypersensitivity on the operated paw while the non-operated is only \nslightly affected relative to sham operated mice. (* <0.05, **<0.01, ***<0.001, ipsilateral relative to contralateral)."
