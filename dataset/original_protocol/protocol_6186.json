    "Experimental setupThe Phecomp cages should be placed on a stable rack to avoid vibrations that can be detected by the food/liquid sensors and lead to inexact registers.For the mice given free access to CM and SC the side of the feeder containing the chocolate mixture, must be alternated to avoid side bias. However, once designated, the food located in each feeder should remain the same along the experiment.Chocolate Mixture diet preparation: To prepare the CM, break into small pieces an equal-weighted amount of Bounty®, Mars®, Snickers® and Milka® chocolate and mix in a bowl. Heat the mixture in a microwave oven at 350 W for 2 min to obtain a homogeneous mash. Extend the mixture while it is still melt on a smooth surface and as a result obtain a chocolate table of approximately two centimeters of thickness. Keep the resulting tablet in a refrigerator at least 24 h. Once solidified, cut the resulting tablet in small and equal pellets to obtain pellets that have a similar shape to the commercial standard chow pellet.Note: Because the organoleptic properties of the food have an impact on the hedonic value, the homogeneity of the mixture during the extension of the tablet is crucial. In the same line, we recommend storing the chocolate in the fridge until giving to animals. We advise changing the chocolate at least twice a week. Acclimatization to isolation (habituation phase)House mice (C57Bl/6J 12 week old males) individually into the Phecomp cages (habituation phase) providing standard chow and water ad libitum for at least 10 days prior to initiating the diet-induced obesity protocol to define the baseline meal pattern and locomotor activity.Note: The characterization of the time-course and dynamics of obesity-related behavioral changes requires isolation.",
    "The protocol can be used in both sexes but females show greater responses to stress than males (Senst et al., 2016).Obesity development phaseWeigh the mice and distribute them randomly (using Excel RAND() function) to the different diet conditions (chocolate mixture, or high-fat diet) balanced by body weight (8-12 mice per group). For each condition, use littermates as control pair animals (only given standard chow).Feed control group with standard chow and experimental mice with free choice between chocolate and SC or with only high-fat diet for 8 weeks. Animals are recorded uninterruptedly during periods of 3 or 4 days. Between these periods the system is paused during approximately one hour, for refilling the feeders and the cleaning of the cages.Notes:  All diets are offered ad libitum. At the end of the obesity development phase, the increase of body weight must be significant in case groups as compared with controls (approximately 40% higher weight for HF mice and 10% higher weight for CM mice, see Espinosa-Carrasco et al., 2018a). Weigh mice two times a week. Circadian recording of food consumption, water intake and activity are obtained of the overall phase by using the automated collection system (Phecomp cages and Compulse software, see equipment and software sections, respectively). Longer recordings (6 days) will be much more informative of the more “natural” animal behavior but shorter recordings are needed for keeping track of all the possible problems arising inside cages (e.g., accumulation of dirtiness on dispensers which could interfere with signal transduction and/or infrared beams disruption by the sawdust). Therefore, we considered 3-4 days long recording is the most suitable option. Body weight and feeding behavior analysisRegister body weight twice a week for the entire experimental period, always at the same time of the day.",
    "Determine body weight gain by subtracting the body weight on the 1st day of CM or HF exposure from the body weight on subsequent days.Testing phaseAt the end of the obesity development phase, evaluate the appearance of diet-induced non-adaptive behaviors, such as compulsive behavior or behavioral inflexibility. Evaluation of compulsive-intake in diet-induced obese miceDeprive the animals of food during 24 h (water still provided ad libitum) and record feeding behavior upon the return of food (standard chow for control mice, chocolate mixture and standard chow or high-fat diet for case mice of Conditions 1 and 2, respectively). Twenty-four hours of food restriction is a powerful meal inducer having relatively little influence on its overall or long-term well-being (Toth and Gardiner, 2000). The increase in energy intake (KJ) after refeeding compared to free feeding conditions provides information on the influence of hunger on food seeking and food taking. Restrict the access to food to 2 h per day at the beginning of the dark phase (20:30-22:30 h) for 6 consecutive days. On Days 1, 3 and 5 the available food is standard chow (for control), standard chow and chocolate mixture (case mice in Condition 1) or high-fat diet (case mice in Condition 2). Days 2, 4 and 6 only standard chow is available to all animals. Water is still provided ad libitum. No food is provided the rest of the day (22 h of starvation), see Figure 1B. This food-restriction schedule allows maintaining the motivation in mice that will be alternately exposed to their non-preferred and their preferred diets. It has been demonstrated to be safe before and mice do recover their body weight (Tucci et al., 2006).",
    "Note: After the 6-day testing phase animals from both conditions are given ad libitum food access to allow the recovery of their normal weight and feeding behavior. For some mice it is common to find pieces of the HF pellets inside the cages. Over-taking is a signature of impulsivity and compulsion, and our main interest is modeling compulsive behavior. For this reason, we recommend using the Phecomp recordings with correction of the spillage (e.g., by subtracting the amount of non-eaten food inside the cage). Otherwise, we cannot assume the entire food intake registered corresponds to the real food eaten. Evaluation of the inflexible food taking Limited access to energy-dense foodsRestrict the access to CM or HF pellets to 1 h per day during the light (resting) phase of the light-dark cycle (from 14:00 to 15:00 h) for 3 consecutive days in overweight mice. Standard chow and water are still provided ad libitum, see Figure 1C.Note: The rest of the day all mice are fed with SC ad libitum. The test evaluates (i) inflexible behavior, flexible consumers are expected to restore standard chow intake whereas inflexible ones will reject standard chow and keep on waiting for its CM or HF; and (ii) compulsive intake binge-like eating episodes characterized by rapid consumption of high quantities of CM or HF during refeeding. Food adulteration with quinine hydrochlorideExpose mice in condition 1 or condition 2 to adulterate (CM or HF) diet and standard diet during 24 h food ad libitum access. For food adulteration with Quinine hydrochloride, add 3 grams of quinine hydrochloride per kg of food during the chocolate mixture mash preparation. Stir the mixture to assure the concentration of quinine in the mixture is homogeneous.",
    "Note: Because of bitter taste may impair the hedonic characteristics of CM/HF, the rationale of this test is to identify inflexible consumers as an indicator of compulsive intake. Creating this conflict, flexible mice (self-controlled ones) change their consumption to unadulterated non-preferred food whilst inflexible consumers do not respond to this bitter taste and continue to take this food. The concentration of quinine chosen was determined experimentally to be aversive in C57BL/6J mice. Control mice are given choice between standard chow and adulterated standard chow to control for bitter taste detection. Weight, food consumption and water intake of all mice are measured before and after every test.  Note: Following the limited access 3-day test, animals are kept on their usual diet in ad libitum conditions to allow the recovery of their normal weight and feeding behavior."
