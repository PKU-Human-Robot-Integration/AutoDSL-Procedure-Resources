Incubate assembloids in an environmentally controlled chamber for 30–60 minutes before imaging.\nNote: Imaging NM contains neurobasal-A without phenol red, B-27 supplement without vitamin A, GlutaMax (1:100) and penicillin and streptomycin (1:100). See neural media table[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.1] for details.\nNote: It is important to make sure that assembloids are settled at the bottom of the well before imaging. Perform a short (10–15min) pre-imaging recording to exclude drift in the position of the assembloid.\nNote: The user can use a square-well 96-well imaging plate instead of a round welled 96-well imaging plate. Placing assembloids on a corner of the well can reduce drift.\nCritical: It is important to use the central wells on the plate to ensure that the microscope objective can safely move and image cells.\nSelect the FOV and start the imaging session.\nNote: We have used a 20× (0.75 NA) objective with 2–2.5× zoom at 1024 × 1024 resolution to achieve the necessary magnification and resolution.\nNote: The specific imaging parameters (e.g. laser power, signal averaging, zoom) should be empirically determined based on the experimental needs, microscope specifications and viral reporter used.\nCritical: The use of sparsely labeled FOVs (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) can minimize the likelihood of capturing too many interneurons with overlapping trajectories, which makes the downstream analysis more challenging.",
    "Note: We have imaged 15–45 seconds per volume (i.e., z-stack; 9–15 μm per stack) to temporally resolve the cellular dynamics involved in the nucleokinesis events. Hours-long imaging at faster imaging rates could induce phototoxicity, although this may be possible with a spinning disk confocal microscope.\nOptional: If an experiment requires pharmacological modulation, perform a half-volume medium change with fresh medium containing the drug at twice the working concentration.\nOptional: Adjust the fields for minor shifts prior to post-drug imaging.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1740-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. High-resolution imaging of migration in forebrain assembloids\n(A) Left: Representative images of densely labeled or sparsely labeled (ideal for Deeplabcut analysis) FOVs from forebrain assembloids labeled with Dlxi1/2b-eGFP. Right: Representative snapshots showing successful Deeplabcut tracking of trailing branch, soma front and soma rear of a migrating interneuron.\n(B) Removal of Deeplabcut (DLC) ROI mismatching artifacts by moving median smoothing (k=100) in soma front (top panel) and soma rear (bottom) tracts during a saltation event.\nScale bars: 20μm (A and B). The assembloid sketch in 3A is adapted from (Birey et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nSubcellular tracking of migrating human cortical interneurons using Deeplabcut\nTiming: ∼1–2 days per dataset\nThis section will describe a step-by-step protocol for setting up the analysis pipeline for markerless tracking of cellular and subcellular ROIs using Deeplabcut.\nPrepare the imaging files for Deeplabcut.\nCorrect for drift using Fiji with the Linear Stack Alignment plugin.\nSmoothen using Fiji with the Gaussian Blur 3D plugin.\nCrop the image to only include an individual interneuron undergoing at least one saltation.\nRecord the pixel / micron ratio of the image in Fiji under “Image > Show info…”. It is listed as “Resolution”.\nSave as .avi file.\nInstall Deeplabcut following developers’ instructions[href=https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut].\nLaunch Deeplabcut, initiate a new project and fill in the relevant details.",
    "In the Config file, rename the ROIs accordingly. ROI names are located under “Annotation data set configuration / body parts” and “Plotting configuration / skeleton”.\nAutomatically extract 19 training frames using the k-means algorithm.\nNote: We successfully used the default parameters (cluster step = 1, network = resnet_50, augmentation = imgaug).\nManually annotate ROIs in each training frame for each video and train the network for up to 100,000 iterations or until the loss is plateaued.\nNote: This step can take several hours.\nEvaluate network and analyze videos with filtered predictions. Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A shows tracking of different ROIs of a representative migrating interneuron.\nNote: Videos used for analysis are the same videos used for training.\nExport results as a .csv file. The output is X and Y coordinates in pixels per ROI.\nConvert X and Y pixel coordinates to Euclidean distances in micron using the pixel/micron ratio. These values can be used to estimate the relative positional information of each ROI across the time series. We provide a conversion template under “quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis]”.\nNote: Outlier frames can be extracted, and the network can then be retrained for more accurate ROI identification.\nCritical: Detect occasional ROI mismatch by outlier likelihood measure displayed in the .csv readout and use a smoothing function (e.g. moving median function in MATLAB (k=100; Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B)) to correct for such artifacts.\nOptional: Visually validate the tracking fidelity by converting X and Y pixel coordinates to time series ROIs for each movie in FiJi and confirm that each ROI is localized to appropriate subcellular locus per frame.\nImaging network-level calcium activity in forebrain assembloids\nTiming: 7–14 days for plating on inserts, ∼1 day of imaging per session",
    "This section will describe a step-by-step protocol for setting up a calcium imaging experiment to assess network activity in forebrain assembloids.\nSeed GCaMPx-labeled forebrain assembloids 7–14 days before imaging on 0.4 μm-transparent trans-well inserts to achieve a flattened geometry (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B).\nTransfer the inserts with assembloids to glass-bottom 6-well imaging plates containing 1.5–2 mL of imaging NM medium, positioned in the environmentally controlled imaging chamber of the confocal microscope, and incubate for 30–60 minutes before imaging.\nConfirm the orientation of the assembloids (hCS side versus hSS side) by the expression of the red-shifted marker and set the imaging parameters.\nNote: It is important to eliminate any bleed-through between channels before imaging; a quick test can be performed where only a single laser line is turned on while both GCaMPx and red-shifted detectors are on.\nNote: Using a Leica TCS SP8 equipped with a resonant scanner and a 10× (0.4 NA) objective, we have imaged calcium activity at cellular resolution at the imaging speeds ranging from 4–14 Hz, (FOV 0.75 × 0.75mm to 1.8×.18mm, single imaging planes were used without a z-stack).\nNote: A 10–15-minutes imaging session is usually sufficient to sample a representative activity profile of the network.\nFor analysis, identify the cell somas (using the red-shifted marker or using the standard deviation projection of the GCaMP signal over time) .\nCollect mean gray values from the soma using Fiji.\nTransform mean gray values to relative changes in fluorescence: dF/F(t) = (F(t)−F0)/F0, where F0 represents average gray values of the time series of each ROI.",
    "Optional: For longitudinal, within-assembloid experiments, mark the orientation of the insert with a sterile marker after the first imaging session and transfer the insert back to the 6-well culture plate with 1.5 ml of NM. The landmark can then be used to position the insert accordingly and find the same FOV during subsequent imaging sessions."
