    "All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. The electron microscopy study is part of the normal routine for microscopic investigation of the samples received for diagnostic purposes and does not require approval by the Bioethics Committee. This study is retrospective and respects the complete anonymity of the samples.\n1. TEM protocol for FFPE (formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded) retrieval and glutaraldehyde-fixed tissue specimens\nRetrieve the last hematoxylin- and eosin-stained slides and the FFPE tissue block.\nWith a permanent marker, select the area of interest on the tissue slide and match it to the area on the tissue block.\nCut out the selected area with a new razor blade from the block and accurately cut it into 5 mm cubes on filter paper.\nPlace the filter paper with the retrieved tissue in a labelled petri dish. Lodge the petri dish in a 60-70 °C oven for 15 min, i.e., until the paraffin melts (paraffin wax consists of a mixture of solid straight-chain hydrocarbons ranging in melting point of 48 °C-66 °C (120 to 150 °F)) and gets absorbed by the filter paper.\nTransfer the retrieved tissue free of paraffin into a scintillation vial filled with 4 mL of 100% toluene (methylbenzene) v/v [100% toluene means 100 mL of toluene]. Ensure that the samples continuously rotate through the deparaffinization process (Rotation speed: 24 rotations/min).\nGo through two changes of toluene, 1 h each, and one change of 4 mL of 100% toluene 30 min each, using an angled rotating device.",
    "Proceed through one change in 4 mL of 100% absolute ethanol (C2H5OH) for 1 h, and then two changes of 4 mL of 100% absolute ethanol for 30 min each. Then, another change of 30 min in 4 mL of 70% ethanol.\nProceed through one change of 4 mL of 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, 30 min. Transfer the specimens in 4 mL of 2.5% glutaraldehyde and keep at 4 °C until processing.\nUse the following steps in an automated tissue processor to standardize the processing: 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer for 5 min, 2% osmium tetroxide for 1 h and 50 min, dH2O for 5 min, 50% ethanol for 15 min, 70% ethanol for 30 min, 100% ethanol for 15 min (three times), 100% ethanol for 30 min (three times), 100% ethanol for 45 min, acetone for 50 min, resin for 1 h (two times), and fresh resin overnight. The volume of all solutions is 15 mL.\nEmbed with fresh resin right out of the tissue processor.\n\t\nPosition polyethylene capsules in a holder with numbered strips of paper. Drop fresh resin in the capsules, transfer the specimen to the appropriate blocks and keep the blocks overnight in a 60 °C (140 °F) oven.\nStain semi-thin (500 nm) sections with 1% toluidine blue on the hot plate, minimum heat setting for 30 s, rinse in dH2O, and then place a coverslip.\nHere, the Ultracut microtome (UCM) is used for sectioning semi-thin sections.\n\t\nTake resin embedded block and install it in the block holder of the UCM. Then, install the block holder on the stage of the UCM and tighten it.\nCut excess resin around the sample using a single edge coated razor blade using the oculars. Cut the face of the block in a trapezoidal shape.",
    "Remove the block holder from the stage and install it in the UCM arm, tight. Next, install the blade holder on the UCM stage. Finally, tighten a glass knife on the blade holder.\nUsing the oculars and the light provided by the UCM, slide the edge of the glass knife slowly, as close as possible, to the surface of the resin block to cut. Tighten the blade holder in place on the stage.\nSet the cutting thickness of the UCM at 500 nm and trim the resin block until 75% full-faced.\nChange the glass knife to a new one. Add sterile water to the glass knife's reservoir.\nLabel a microscope slide with the case number and put four separate drops of sterile water on the glass slide.\nStill at 500 nm setting, cut four sections from the block. Using fine forceps, transfer 1 section at a time in one of the drops of water on the glass slide. Each drop on the slide will contain one section. Dry the slide on a hot plate at the lowest heat setting until dry (30 s).\nStain with the Toluidine blue method. Rinse in water and place a coverslip. Examine toluidine blue sections under a light microscope. If desired tissue structures are visible, cut ultra-thin sections. If desired tissue structures are not visible, cut deeper sections and stain them using the same steps until desired structures are exposed and shown on the toluidine blue slide.\nWhen the desired area for electron microscopy is identified from the toluidine blue sections, cut the ultra-thin sections on the copper grids. Cut ultrathin slices using an ultramicrotome (samples destined for viewing in the TEM must be cut into very thin slices (80 nm)).",
    "Take resin embedded block and install it in the block holder of the UCM. Then, install the block holder on the stage of the UCM and tighten it.\nUsing the oculars, cut the resin around the desired area for electron microscopy using a single-edge coated razor blade. Cut the face of the block in a trapeze shape, no bigger than 1 mm square. If the desired area for electron microscopy is challenging to see because of the glare of the light, use a dab of chloroform to highlight the structures in the resin block.\nRemove the block holder from the stage and install it in the UCM arm, tight. Next, install the blade holder on the UCM stage. Finally, tighten a diamond knife on the blade holder.\nUsing the oculars and the light provided by the UCM, slide the edge of the diamond knife slowly, as close as possible, to the surface of the resin block to cut. Tighten the blade holder in place on the stage.\nAdjust the different angles of the diamond knife using the screws of the UCM. Ensure that the edge of the diamond knife is aligned as perfectly as possible with the surface of the block to cut. Fill the diamond knife's reservoir with sterile water.\nSet the UCM at 80 nm thickness and 1 mm/s speed. Here, the automated function is used for ultra-thin sectioning. Set the window of cutting on the UCM (top and bottom of the block's face).\nPress the Start button of the UCM to start sectioning. The sections will float on the sterile reservoir of the diamond knife.\nWhen enough sections are cut, use chloroform fumes to straighten the sections. Dip a cotton swab in chloroform and pass it above the sections without touching them.",
    "Dip a copper grid in 100% alcohol and then sterile water using fine forceps. Clean each grid before being used. Pick the sections on a few grids.\nLeave the grids with sections on labeled filter paper. Place this filter paper in a Petri dish and put it in the 60 °C oven for 30 min to allow the sections to dry on the grids.\nThen, perform the contrast staining.\n\t\nStain the grids in uranyl acetate or any environment-friendly alternative substitutive for 1 min. Then, rinse them in sterile water for injection (40 dips in four different water containers for each rinse after uranyl acetate and lead citrate). Lead citrate step is also 1 min.\nInsert the grid in the TEM, allowing a high voltage electron beam to be emitted by a cathode and created by magnetic lenses. The beam that has been partially transmitted through the thin (electron-semitransparent) specimen forms the TEM information on the screen (see below).\n2. TEM protocol for scanning and photographing the specimens\nAfter the sections on the grids are stained, screen them with the electron microscope. At the electron microscope, turn on the ACC voltage to a pre-established setting (200-300 kV), which depends on the electron microscope used.\nAt the computer, turn on the digital camera software and enter the case number. This is important because the microphotographs are saved in the corresponding case file.\nLoad the grid in the electron microscope, pull the gun sample halfway out and flip the switch to AIR to allow the vacuum from the specimen gun chamber to fill with ambient (room) air.\nOnce it is full of air, pull out the gun sample. Place the gun sample on the designed holder. Then, flip open the grid holder at the tip of the gun.",
    "Place the grid in place. Close the grid holder and ensure that the grid is secured.\nPut the gun sample back in the specimen chamber halfway through and flip the switch to EVAC to create a vacuum in the specimen chamber.\nThe green light indicator will turn on when the vacuum is achieved in the specimen chamber. Then, push the gun sample carefully into the electron microscope column and make sure not to allow it to go too fast. Otherwise, it would damage the object at the tip of the gun sample.\nOnce the grid is well in place in the electron microscope column, turn on the filament to the intermediate (pre-established) saturation setting.\nTurn on the camera through the ON/OFF switch. On the computer, click on Live Image in the imaging software.\nOn the electron microscope, push the Low Magnification button and open the objective aperture. This allows for choosing the desired screening area. Next, position the desired area of the section to the middle of the computer screen, using the two controllers on either side of the electron microscope's column.\nOn the electron microscope, push the Zoom button and close the objective aperture to obtain better contrast.\nStart the screening of the section by taking microphotographs at 2,500x magnification. Then, adjust the focus using the wobbler button and the brightness button on the electron microscope to ensure the quality of the microphotograph.\nClick on Final Image on the computer to take the microphotograph. If the colors are not even, perform a background correction on the camera software. Also, adjust the contrast on the final image using the software before saving the microphotograph.\nWhen the microphotograph is being saved, double-check the case number and magnification to ensure proper identification of the microphotographs taken.",
    "NOTE: In some cases, the user can also enter extra captions, and the electron microscopy technologist's initials are also entered.\nPerform the micrograph process through the whole area of the section to be screened. After enough 2,500x magnification, microphotographs are saved to cover the area of interest, capture 4,000x and 8,000x magnification microphotographs and save them on the computer with the appropriate case number identification.\nMake a close-up on the section for specific ultrastructural details if very specific screening instructions are given. Then, save the measurements of specific ultrastructural details in the computer considering higher magnifications if needed.\nWhen the specimen screening is complete, turn off the filament, the camera, the high voltage, and the camera software in sequence. Next, remove the grid from the electron microscope column, allowing air in the gun sample chamber.\nFile the grid in a gelatin capsule and store the capsule in a properly labeled box, along with the resin blocks of the same case. Put the gun sample back in the gun chamber and store it in a cool and dry environment to preserve the material used.\nTransfer the digital microphotographs on common collaborative platforms (e.g., SharePoint) or internal servers to allow the pathologist to view them.\nEnter the work units in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).\nIf more specific microphotographs are required, pull out the field grid and reuse them for additional screening or specific questions.\nSubscription Required.
