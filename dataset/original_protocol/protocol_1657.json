Timeline for sustained KA stimulation\nNote: This protocol is optimized for neurons plated in a 6 well dish (35 mm per well) with a plating density of 500,000 cells. The same protocol can also be used for neurons plated in independent dishes of different sizes with adequate scaling. For optimal consistency, we do not recommend labeling more than 6–7 wells at a time.\nNote: While, as an example, we outline the procedure to perform kainate simulation of primary hippocampal neurons, this basic procedure can be modified to perform stimulation of neurons with any drug of choice.\nNote: As outlined above, kainate stimulation is carried out in the presence of TTX and GYKI53655 to prevent action potential firing and direct activation of AMPARs by kainate, respectively.\nReduce the media in each well to 2 mL.\nNote: If required, the media in each well can be reduced from 2 mL to 1 mL dependent on resource availability. However, it is important to ensure that the neurons are always covered with media to prevent drying out.\nTransfer 500 μL of media from each well to new Eppendorf tubes.\nAdd 2 μL of TTX (1 mM stock) and 8 μL GYKI53655 (10 mM stock).\nMix well by pipetting up and down and carefully add the solutions back into the repective wells, giving a final concentration in the media of 1 μM TTX and 40 μM GYKI53655.\nCritical: Care should be taken not to dislodge the neurons while adding media.\nLeave the plates in a 37°C incubator for 30 min.",
    "Aspirate the drug-containing media and replace it with prewarmed Earle’s buffer (Control and kainate).\nLeave the plates in the incubator for 20 min.\nNote: Constant levels of media must be maintained in each well to ensure that the final concentration of drugs in each well is consistent.\nLive surface biotinylation of neurons\nTiming: 3 h\nLabeling of neuronal surface proteins with Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin for subsequent isolation using streptavidin beads\nNote: It is recommended that neurons are left on ice for 5–10 min after being removed from the incubator especially while performing acute experiments that may alter the trafficking of surface receptors. Cooling down the neurons to 4°C prevents trafficking of the receptors and avoids cold shocking the neurons by immediate addition of an ice-cold buffer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nNote: Any of the above-mentioned buffers (Earle’s buffer, HBS, DPBS) can be used, but for pharmacological stimulations, either pre-warmed Earle’s buffer or HBS is preferred, and the same buffer (cold) is advised for washing. DPBS is ideal for biotinylation without prior stimulations.\nLeave dishes containing neurons on ice for 5–10 min.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1216-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic representation of neuronal surface biotinylation using Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin\nAspirate the neuronal media and wash the cells 2 times with 2 mL of cold Earle’s buffer.\nCritical: Washing should be performed with caution to prevent dislodging of the neurons from the plates.\nAspirate the buffer and add 1.5 mL of buffer containing 0.3 mg/mL Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin and incubate on ice for 10 min with gentle swirling every 2.5 min.\nAfter labeling the surface proteins with biotin, wash the cells 3 times with 2 mL of cold Earle's buffer.\nAspirate the buffer, add 2 mL of 100 mM NH4Cl to each well, and incubate on ice for 1 min to scavenge unbound Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin.",
    "After 1 min, aspirate the buffer containing NH4Cl and gently wash once with cold Earle's buffer.\nRemove the buffer and add 200 μL of neuronal lysis buffer.\nNote: Although we recommend using 200 μl of neuronal lysis buffer to lyse the cells, we advise the experimenter to scale this according to the abundance of their protein of interest or depending on the quality of antibody used for detection by Western blot.\nGently rotate the plate, and scrape off the cells from all sides of the well using a cell scraper.\nTransfer the lysate to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nSonicate the lysate briefly (3 pulses at 2.5 amplitude for ∼2 s).\nLeave the lysate on ice for 30 min.\nWashing streptavidin beads\nTiming: 10 min\nWashing of streptavidin beads with lysis buffer to remove any unwanted components in the storage buffer\nNote: This protocol assumes 6 different wells of neurons are being labeled. For more or fewer conditions, the volume of beads washed should be scaled up/down accordingly (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1216-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Schematic representation of streptavidin bead washing\n∗Add 150 μL of beads to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube containing 1 mL of wash buffer.\nCritical: When pipetting beads, the tip of the pipette tip must be cut off to prevent damaging the beads as they pass up the narrow tip.\nWash the beads twice with the wash buffer by centrifugation at 1500g at 4°C for 2 min then remove the supernatant by aspiration.\nAfter the second wash, aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the beads to 1 mL in the wash buffer.\n∗∗Add 150 μL of beads to each of 6 Eppendorf tubes (1.5 mL) with constant inverting to ensure that the beads are mixed properly.\nLeave the beads on ice until the lysate is prepared (30 min–1 h).",
    "Note: ∗Calculation: 150 μL of beads are used as per the following calculation: Each Eppendorf tube for the pull-down should have 20 μL of beads. So, to allow for pipetting error, 25 μL of beads are washed per condition (25 μL × 6 = 150 μL).\nNote: ∗∗Calculation: After making up to 1 mL, divide 900 μL by the number of conditions to determine what volume to add to each Eppendorf tube (so, for 6 conditions, 900/6 = 150 μL is added to each well). When calculating, 100 μL is deducted from 1 mL to ensure sufficient beads remain for all conditions after accounting for pipetting error.\nPull-down of labeled proteins with streptavidin beads\nTiming: 1.5–2 h\nCentrifuge the lysate at 16,000g at 4°C for 30 min to pellet cell debris.\nTransfer the supernatant (the cleared lysate) to a fresh 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube without disturbing the pellet.\nPause point: At this point the supernatant can be stored at −20°C for short-term (∼1 month) and −80°C for long-term storage (∼6 months).\nAdd 80 μL of the cleared cell lysate to the beads.\nAdd 270 μL of wash buffer to each Eppendorf tube to make the final volume 500 μL (150 μL beads + 80 μL of lysate = 230 μL)\nLeave the Eppendorf tube on a rotating wheel at 4°C for 1 h.\nAdd 20 μL of the cleared cell lysate to a fresh Eppendorf tube (this serves as a “whole lysate” sample for the subsequent Western blot).",
    "Note: In our experience, ∼25% of AMPAR subunits are surface expressed; thus we add 80 μL lysate onto the beads for pull-down and preserve 20 μL of the sample (1/4th of the amount added to the beads) as lysate (total protein). However, the experimenter should scale this amount depending on their protein of interest and its abundance on the cell surface to ensure roughly equal amounts of target protein are present in the pull-down and lysate samples.\nWash the beads by adding 500 μL of wash buffer and centrifuging at 1500g at 4°C for 2 min.\nAspirate the buffer and repeat the wash step another 2 times, for a total of 3 washes.\nAspirate the supernatant and add 40 μL of 2× sample buffer to the beads.\nAdd 20 μL of 2× sample buffer to the 20 μL whole lysate sample to make a final concentration of 1× sample buffer.\nHeat both beads and lysate samples on a heating block for 10 min at 95°C to denature the proteins and to elute the proteins from the beads.\nNote: Centrifuge the beads at 1500g for 2 min before loading the samples on an SDS-PAGE to ensure beads are settled at the bottom of the Eppendorf tube.\nLoad 20 μL of pull-down and lysate samples in separate wells for Western blotting and detection of the receptor of interest.\nPause point: After boiling, the samples can be stored at −20°C for ≥ 6 months",
    "Note: We strongly recommend blotting for an intracellular protein (e.g., GAPDH) as a negative control to ensure that the neurons remained intact throughout the labeling step and that Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin, the biotinylation reagent, has not been able to enter the cells and label internal proteins. It is important to emphasize that the Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin reagent used here is cell impermeant whereas standard biotin present in media is cell permeable."
