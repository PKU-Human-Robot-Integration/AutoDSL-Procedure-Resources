    "Animal studies have been approved by the Animal Care and Utilization Committee of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (Wuhan, China).\nNOTE: Male C57BL/6J mice (8-10 weeks) are used as models. Mice have free access to food and water and are bred in specific pathogen-free conditions. The room is maintained under controlled temperature (22 °C ± 2 °C) and humidity (45%-65%). Mice are exposed to a 12-h light/dark environment at the Animal Care Facility of Tongji Medical School (Wuhan, China) according to the guidelines set by this institution. Use sterile microsurgical instruments and surgical supplies. Surgical gloves and masks are required throughout the procedure. The experimental workflow is shown in Figure 1A.\n1. Preoperative preparation\nUse a rectangular operating table (OT) with a prewarmed heating pad (37 °C) throughout the surgical procedure (Figure 1B). Disinfect the board with ultraviolet light and 70% alcohol before procedure initiation.\nWeigh all mice accurately to calculate the dose of anesthetic drugs needed. Then, anesthetize the mice with ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection. Ensure appropriate depth of anesthesia by the absence of a withdrawal reflex to toe pinching and blink reflexes.\nPlace the mouse supine on the OT with gauze under the head to avoid overheating of the eyes. Apply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes to prevent them from drying out.\nShave the fur on the left precordial chest with an electric razor. Use a fur removal cream on the pre-shaved thorax and massage evenly with a sterile cotton swab for ~1 min. Wipe the excess loose fur with gauze.\nUse povidone-iodine, followed by 70% alcohol to clean the area. Cover the thorax with gauze.",
    "Use a 4-0 suture under the upper incisors and secure it to the anchor point (close to the edge of the OT over the nose) to keep the mouth slightly open and facilitate cannulation.\nPull the tail to keep the body straight, and secure the tail to the OT using tape. Secure the four limbs and tighten them on the other anchor points. Importantly, do not over-stretch the front limbs; otherwise, respiratory compromise may occur.\nUse curved forceps and forceps to open the jaw and lift the tongue. Use an illuminator to clearly visualize the throat and glottis.\nInsert a 22-G cannula gently with a blunted and truncated needle into the trachea through the mouth ~1-cm down the throat.Use one hand to hold the tongue, move it slightly upwards with blunt forceps, and, simultaneously, use the other hand to gently insert the tube into the trachea. Be careful not to insert the tube into the esophagus.\nRemove the needle gently. Check the intubation by placing the tube into the water for bubbles to form before connecting to the ventilator.\nConnect the endotracheal tube to a ventilator set to 120/min and tidal volume adjusted to 250 µL.\n\tNOTE: The ventilator setting is adjusted by body weight (in general, a higher body weight requires a higher tidal volume).\nVerify intubation by checking bilateral symmetrical chest expansion. Then, the connection is fixed to the OT with tape to avoid the tube falling off.\nPlace ECG electrodes on the paws and connect them to the ECG recorder. Monitor cardiac electrophysiology throughout the procedure.\n2. Thoracotomy",
    "Remove the gauze on the thorax. Disinfect again with 70% alcohol for the incision areas using three scrub cycles. Then, cover the mouse with a sterile surgical drape with a hole over the surgical field to reduce contamination of the surgical site.\nMake an oblique skin incision (0.8-1.0 cm) along the left midclavicular line with a sterile scalpel.\nUndertake blunt dissection of subcutaneous tissues to expose the ribs underneath. Be careful not to injure vessels, ribs, and lungs. Stop the bleeding by using sterile cotton applicators.\nIdentify and make an incision of about 6-8 mm in the third intercostal space. Then, carry out blunt dissection of tissues in the intercoastal space to open the chest cavity. Be careful not to injure the internal thoracic artery.\nUse forceps to span the intercostal space. Insert pre-sterilized homemade retractors (Figure 1C) into the rib cage and pull back to spread the incision to ~6 mm in width. Attach the retractors to the OT with rubber bands.\nRemove the surrounding tissues carefully to expose the heart fully. Pull off the pericardium gently with curved forceps without injuring the heart. Now a clear view of the heart is available.\n3. LAD ligation\nNOTE: The LAD appears as a thin red line running perpendicular from near the apex and down through the left ventricle. The LAD is bright-red color, so be careful not to mistake it for a vein. Usually, the ligation site is ~1-2 mm below the left auricle. This ligation position will produce about 40%-50% of the ischemia in the left ventricle. A higher position will create a more extensive infarct zone. A more distal site will create a smaller infarct zone.",
    "Use a dissecting microscope and direct a focused and appropriate light for LAD visualization. Press the site below the chosen ligation position gently to enlarge the LAD temporarily (≤5 s per time). Recheck the LAD in this way.\nUse a tapered needle (3/8, 2.5 x 5) to pass an 8-0 silk ligature underneath the LAD under a dissecting microscope. Be careful with the needle depth: not too deep to enter the left ventricle and not too shallow to avoid damaging the LAD.\nTie the ligature with a loose double-knot. The loop diameter is about 2-3 mm.\nPlace a 2-3 mm PE-10 tubing into a loop parallel to the artery.\nTighten the ligature loop gently until it is around the artery and tubing. Then, secure the loop with a slipknot. Take care not to damage the myocardial wall with excessive tightening pressure.\n\tNOTE: Ligation is not carried out for the sham-operation group.\nConfirm cessation of blood flow in the LAD: observe a paler color in the anterior wall of the LV after ligation. In addition,significant ST-elevation within a few heartbeats also indicates occlusion16. If permanent ligation is required (e.g., MI), remove the PE-10 tubing and tie the LAD directly with a knot. Resume the remaining procedure as mentioned in step 4.3 below.\nRemove the retractors from the incision. Then, close the wound temporarily with a bulldog clamp. Ischemia duration is according to the experimental design. Ensure that the mouse continues to be connected to the ventilator.\n4. Reperfusion\nWhen the period of ischemia ends, remove the bulldog clamp and insert the retractors again to open the incision and expose the heart (especially the ligation site).",
    "Untie the slipknot and remove the PE-10 tubing. Confirm the restoration of blood flow in this step by observing the color change back to pink-red within 20 s. Simultaneously, watch the ECG carefully: a potential dissolution of ST-elevation also suggests reperfusion.\nLeave the 8-0 ligature in situ for subsequent Evans-Blue and TTC staining. In other cases, remove the suture at this step.\nRemove the retractors and close the incision by suturing the third and fourth ribs with a 4-0 nylon suture. Be careful not to injure the lung. Push out the air that might be trapped in the chest cavity by pressing the chest gently while tying the suture knots.\nClose the muscle layers with continuous sutures. Close the skin with a 4-0 nylon suture; continuous sutures and interrupted sutures are acceptable.\n5. Postoperative care\nObserve the mouse carefully for signs of recovery from anesthesia, for example, movement of the tail or whiskers. After that, the mouse usually resumes a normal breathing pattern with a respiration rate of around 150 bpm. Extubate the mouse by removing the tube slowly.\nMonitor the mouse for an additional 3-5 min to ensure respiratory distress is absent.\nAdminister 100 µL of buprenorphine (0.1 mg/mL, s.c.) after the mouse begins to breathe. For the next 24 h, provide an additional dose every 4-6 h. Provide ibuprofen as additional pain relief in drinking water as a 0.2 mg/mL solution for 2 days before and ≤7 days after surgery.\nKeep the mice warm and reduce mortality risk by using thermal insulation blankets as mice are prone to hypothermia after the anesthesia.\n6. Validation after the procedure\nTroponin-T test\n\t\nCollect blood samples from the retroorbital plexuses and isolate the serums by centrifugation (3,000 × g, 10 min, room temperature).",
    "Dilute 20 µL of serum to 100 µL with saline solution for the troponin-T test. Storethe remainder of the samples at -80 °C.\nDetect the Troponin T (cTnT using a commercial kit following the manufacturer's instructions.\nCardiac ultrasound\n\tNOTE: Cardiac ultrasound is used to evaluate cardiac function and wall-motion abnormalities at different stages before and after surgery according to the experimental design17,18. Different parameters such as ventricular wall thickness, ventricular volume, ventricular-cavity diameter, ejection fraction, and short-axis shortening fraction are measured.\n\t\nAnesthetize the mice with ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg)via intraperitoneal injection.\nShave the chest with an electric razor. Use fur removal cream and massage evenly. Wipe the excess loose fur with gauze.\nPlace the mouse on the OT and secure the four limbs with adhesive tape.\nPlace the ultrasound probe (30 MHz) on the anterior region of the heart at ~ 30° to the sternum. The probe in this view is aligned with the long axis of the heart. Set the ultrasound in B-Mode; the left ventricle, left atrium, mitral valve, and ascending aorta can be identified clearly. Use video capture to obtain data for subsequent analysis.\nBy rotating the transducer 90°clockwise, obtain a parasternal short-axis view at the level of the papillary muscles to clearly detect the left and right ventricles. Then use B-Mode and M-Mode to assess cardiac function and morphometry.\nCalculate the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (Dd), end-systolic diameter (Ds), and interventricular septal thickness by specifying the corresponding location in the ultrasound images.",
    "NOTE: The machine would manually calculate left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and end-systolic volume (LVESV). Also, the machine would calculate the values for fractional shortening (FS) and ejection fraction (EF) using formulas FS = (Dd-Ds)/Dd × 100% and EF= (LVEDV-LVESV)/LVEDV × 100%. Choose five consecutive cardiac cycles and obtain their mean values.\nMeasurement of myocardial infarct size\n\tNOTE: Evans-Blue/TTC staining is used to measure the infarct size because it can evaluate tissue viability19. It is recommended to stain within 72 h of reperfusion because the scar will shrink. This step is performed after euthanizing the animal with 200 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium via intraperitoneal injection.\n\t\nExpose the heart again following the previous procedures from steps 2.2-2.5. Then, re-ligate the LAD at the initial site validated by the suture mentioned in step 4.3 at the end of the desired reperfusion duration.\nCannulate the aorta and then perfuse the heart with 0.3 mL of 1% Evans Blue solution. The myocardium of the non-ischemic region is stained blue. After perfusion, remove the heart rapidly by cutting the aorta with scissors.\nThen, wash the heart in KCl solution (30 mM) to stop the heart from beating. Store at -20 °C for ≥4 h after removing the surrounding fatty tissue.\nCut the heart in the transverse direction into five slices of thickness 1 mm using a sharp scalpel. Weigh the slices and then incubate them with 2% TTC for 40 min at 37 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: After the incubation, the infarct areas are demarcated as white, whereas viable tissues in non-infarct areas remain red.\nFix the slices with 4% formaldehyde overnight.\n\t\tNOTE: This action will enhance the contrast between the infarct area and the non-infarct area. It will also shrink the slices.",
    "Photograph the slices with a digital camera. Then, calculate the area at risk (AAR), infarct area, and non-ischemic zone using graphics software.\n\t\tNOTE: After Evans-Blue/TTC double-staining, the blue area is the \"normal\" area. The remaining areas (including white and red) are the \"ischemia risk\" areas: the white area is the myocardial infarction area (IA), and the red area is the ischemic (but not infarcted) area. Taking the inconsistency of sizes of heart slices into account, the results are adjusted for weight.\n\t\tAssign:\n\t\tA1-A5 for Area of infarct zone /Area of the heart slice;\n\t\tB1-B5 for Area of non-infarct zone/ Area of the heart slice;\n\t\tW1-W5 for Weight of the heart slice.\n\t\tThen:\n\t\tTotal weight of infarcted myocardium: W1 × A1 + W2 × A2 + W3 × A3 + W4 × A4 + W5 × A5;\n\t\tTotal weight of non-infarcted myocardium: W1 × B1 + W2 × B2 + W3 × B3 + W4 × B4+ W5 × B5;\n\t\tTotal weight of AAR = (W1 + W2 +W3 + W4 + W5) - (W1 × A1 + W2 × A2 + W3 × A3 + W4 × A4 + W5 × A5)\n\t\tFinally:\n\t\tThe area of myocardial ischemia is calculated as the percentage of AAR in the left ventricle:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63257/63257eq01v2.jpg\n\t\tThe area of myocardial infarction is calculated as the percentage of IA in the AAR:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63257/63257eq02v2.jpg\nSubscription Required.
