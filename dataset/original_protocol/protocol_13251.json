  "procedures": [
    "This study used temporal bones (TB) gathered from the human cadaver subject post-mortem. The study was granted Institutional approval and fulfilled the Helsinki Declaration for the ethical use of human material. Approval for cadaver temporal bones was granted to the Kuopio University Hospital by the Finnish National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health (NRO: 9202/06.01.03.01/2013), and the study was conducted following Finnish regulations and laws. All of the bones were gathered anonymously during medical autopsy.\n1. Removal of the soft tissue from the TB surface\nRemove the soft tissue from the TB surface with a surgical blade and raspatory.\nCarry out the rest of the operation under a surgical microscope and a high-speed surgical drill with an irrigation system. Use ear instruments, such as a micro-dissector, for dissection.\n\t​NOTE: The bur blades needed are a 5 mm cutting bur, a 3 mm rough diamond bur, and a 2 mm fine diamond bur. While smaller diamond burs may be used to open critical and small structures, generally, the 2 mm fine diamond bur will be adequate for this procedure.\n2. Mastoidectomy (Figure 4)\nOpen the cortex and identify the tegmen with the high-speed surgical drill (e.g., 5 mm cutting bur).\nFollow the tegmen and the superior and posterior side of the external ear canal (EEC) to the antrum with the 5 mm cutting bur.\nOpen the antrum and identify the corpus of the incus through the opening of the antrum to the middle ear. Depending on the anatomy, do this with a 5 mm cutting bur or a 3 mm rough diamond bur.\nIdentify the prominence of the lateral semicircular canal (LSC).\nUse the short leg of the incus as a landmark for identifying the facial nerve (FN) posterior to the EEC.",
    "Drill alongside the FN towards the mastoid tip until a space is opened inferior to the EEC.\nDrill open the sinodural angle and the sigmoid sinus in the posterior part of the mastoid cavity to create more space for removing the cochlea. Anatomical landmarks and the cutting lines are presented in Figure 5.\n3. Posterior tympanotomy, removal of the posterior parts of the EEC, and exposing the middle ear\nOpen the facial recess between the facial nerve and the external ear canal with a 2 mm diamond bur. Identify the chorda tympani between the FN and the EEC. For cochlea extraction, remove the chorda tympani.\nAfter opening the posterior tympanotomy, identify the incudostapedial joint and open the joint.\nCut the stapedial tendon with a micro-blade or micro-scissors to avoid dislocation of stapes during the inferior cut of the extraction (step 6.3, the stapedial muscle is drilled and dissected off).\nDrill the buttress away and remove the incus. Open the incudostapedial joint to avoid the dislocation of the stapes' footplate and open the vestibule through the oval window (step 3.2).\nRemove the posterior part of the bony external ear canal with the malleus, tympanic membrane, and skin of the external ear canal in order to create more space. Remove the soft tissue with suction and a micro-dissector.\n\tNOTE: Cut the tensor tympani tendon prior to removing the malleus to facilitate the removal.\n4. Removal of the tissues that are posterior to the cochlea (Figure 5A-C and Figure 6)\nDrill the posterior alongside the posterior side of the tympanic section of the FN following the posterior crus of the LSC and the posterior semicircular canal (PSC). The semicircular canals lead into the vestibulum, which is the anterior border for the drilling for the removal of the posterior parts of the cochlea.",
    "Continue the drilling towards the meatus of the internal auditory canal (IAC).\nForm a cutting line at the middle fossa using the superior semicircular canal (SSC) as a landmark and follow it through the tegmen. Open the SSC from a superior approach through the middle fossa, as the prominence of the SSC can often be identified at the middle fossa. Expose the genicular ganglion (GG) of FN with a diamond drill to serve as a landmark for the SSC from the middle fossa (see step 6.2).\nContinue drilling vertically towards the tip of the mastoid, starting from the vestibulum. The round window is a landmark for identifying the cochlea´s basal turn in the middle ear and acts as the limiting anterior border.\nOpen the posterior cut inferiorly until below the level of the cochlea´s basal turn.\n5. Removal of the lateral and inferior parts of the temporal bone (Figure 5E)\nIdentify the round window, the basal turn of the cochlea, and the canal of the internal carotid artery (ICA) anteriorly to the cochlea's basal turn. Observe the ICA at the anterior of the middle ear, medially to the opening of the eustachian tube.\nDrill into the floor of the middle ear in parallel to the basal turn connecting the cut between the ICA and the cut for the posterior to the FN below the vestibulum.\nUse scissors or a microblade to cut the FN to avoid drilling it away extensively as the FN serves as a good landmark for the orientation during the removal of the cochlea and after the cochlea has been removed.\n\tNOTE: The stapedial muscle is cut with the FN as it has been exposed in the inferior cut.",
    "Continue the drilling to create a space under the basal turn to make it easier to conduct the inferior cut.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the individual anatomy of the TB, the bulbus jugulare may be opened during the drilling of the middle ear floor.\nDrill anterolaterally to the ICA to open the mandibular joint.\nOnce the mandibular joint is opened, identify the ICA and basal turn. Then remove the lateral parts of the TB without any risk of damaging the cochlea.\nCut the superior parts at the roof of the middle ear by drilling open the tegmen from the level of the middle ear all the way to the sigmoid sinus.\n\tNOTE: Usually, it is easy to create the opening at the level of the SSC.\n6. Removal of the anterior and inferior parts of the TB (Figure 5D,E)\nDrill open the ICA through the middle ear. The ICA makes a turn medially anterior to the cochlea; thus, this turn serves as the anterior border for the cochlea.\nContinue drilling superior from the turn of the ICA, parallel to the route of the ICA. Keep continuing the drilling medially following the course of the ICA and remove any excess bone both superiorly and inferiorly to the ICA.\n\tNOTE: Do not extend the drilling posterior of the ICA in order to avoid damaging the cochlea.\nDrill inferiorly alongside the basal turn of the cochlea, approximately 1-1.5 cm for the cut at the posterior parts.\nFor the inferior cut, leave a suitable safety margin between the basal turn and the drilling to ensure the preservation of the cochlea.\n\t​NOTE: if needed, any excess bone here can be honed away carefully after removing the cochlea.\n7. Removal of medial parts of TB (Figure 5F)",
    "Follow the facial towards the GG at the roof of the middle ear.\nExpose the GG with a 3 mm rough diamond drill and continue drilling through the tegmen to the middle fossa.\nDrill open the GG from the middle fossa and follow alongside the FN proximal to GG to the IAC.\nUse the IAC, GG, and SSC as landmarks to form a cut-line medial to the cochlea. The IAC forms an approximately 70° angle with the basal turn of the cochlea. Perform the drilling from the proximal parts of the IAC to the proximal parts of the horizontal segment of the ICA.\nConnect the medial line by first exposing the IAC to the inferior cut.\n8. Finalizing the extraction\nUse the fine diamond bur (e.g., 3-5 mm bur) to carefully hone excess bone around the cochlea if needed for downsizing the sample.\nObserve carefully the color of the bone during the trimming; if the bone starts to change to become translucent, then stop drilling.\nThere should now be a 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm piece containing the intact cochlea. Maintain the orientation by using FN, stapes, and RW.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
