    "1. Fabrication of microfluidic device\nGenerate the desired microfluidic pattern using a layout design software (see Supplemental Materials).\nFabricate the photomask. See Table of Materials for more details.\n\t\nUtilizing a laser writer, write the pattern on a soda-lime glass plate coated with 100 nm of Cr and 500 nm of photoresist AZ1518.\nDevelop the photoresist with developer AZ300MIF for 60 s.\nEtch away the chromium without protection from the photoresist using Cr-7 Chromium Etchant.\nStrip off residual photoresist using a photoresist stripper at 70 °C for 45 min.\nPattern the photoresist. See Table of Materials for more details.\n\t\nSpin coat HMDS on silicon wafer at 4000 rpm for 40 s.\nSpin coat photoresist AZ4330 on silicon wafer at 4000 rpm for 40 s.\nSoft bake the silicon wafer at 95 °C for 60 s.\nUtilize the mask aligner to expose UV to the silicon wafer.\nDevelop the photoresist with developer AZ300MIF for 4 min.\nPerform DRIE etching. See Table of Materials for more details.\n\t\nDry-etch the wafer patterned with the photoresist using a Silicon Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) system for 100 µm depth.\nStrip off the photoresist with acetone and plasma etch with a plasma etcher.\nWafer oxidation and silanization. See Table of Materials for more details.\n\t\nPerform thermal oxidation on the etched silicon wafer in a furnace at 1100 °C for 1 h.\nWait for the silicon wafer to cool down, and then place the wafer into a desiccator with a few drops of trichloro-1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl-silane (PFOTS) dripped in a small container near the wafer.\nPump the pressure of the desiccator to 0.5 atm at room temperature for 60 min. The silicon wafer mold should become hydrophobic after proper silanization, which can be tested by adding several droplets of water onto the wafer.",
    "Soft lithography. See Table of Materials for more details.\n\t\nMix pre-polymer and cross-linker (from polymethylsiloxane (PDMS) kit) at a 10:1 by weight ratio.\nPour the mixed PDMS to create a 10 mm film in height onto the silanized silicon wafer mold.\nDegas the resulting PDMS-silicon wafer system in a desiccator for 30 min to 1 h.\nIncubate the PDMS-silicon wafer in a 70 °C incubator overnight to cure the PDMS.\nOnce the PDMS is cured, peel the PDMS film off the silicon wafer carefully.\nUsing biopsy needles, punch through-holes at the inlet ports based on the location of the pattern on the PDMS and employ a circular punch to cut chips 27 mm in diameter.\nPDMS layer bonding.\n\t\nHeat cure two stacks of 27 mm PDMS cylinders (without patterning), which will become the reservoir layer and the capping layer of the device.\nCut out two 7 mm circles around the inlets on the reservoir layer, and utilize a biopsy needle to punch through-holes at the inlet ports on the capping layer.\nBond three stacks of PDMS (patterned stack, reservoir layer, capping layer) with oxygen plasma treatment.\nWith the biopsy needle, punch through-holes at the outlets and the center port of the device.\n2. Media and cell line preparation\nPrepare media for culturing PC3 cell lines, including PC3-EMT and PC3-EPI: mix RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1x antibiotic-antimycotic. Generate cell lines as described previously14.\n\tNOTE: PC3 cell lines are maintained in the above media in humidified incubators at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Split cells and subculture every 3 days, before they reach 100% confluency.",
    "Transfect cell lines with cytoplasmic-labeled fluorescent markers for better visualization, as described previously12, such that PC3-EMT expresses cytoplasmic GFP and PC3-EPI expresses cytoplasmic mCherry. Note that the technology is also compatible with any fluorescent-labeled cells as well as brightfield imaging of unlabeled cells.\n3. Experimental setup\nFabrication of metal plate holder\n\t\nFabricate a plate holder that is sufficient to hold simultaneous gas-permeable culture dishes for parallel experiments by machining or 3D printing. The 3D CAD file (\"3-well plate.FCStd\") can be found on GitHub as a reference (https://github.com/kechihl/3-well-plate).\nUnscrew the components of the holder (Figure 2) with a screwdriver. Disinfect the components via UV exposure for at least 1 h and leave in a sterile environment.\n\t\tNOTE: The holder is designed to provide substantial conditions for thermal equilibrium and ideal gas compositions, with gas channel inlets that allow for airflow. More details can be found in our previous work12.\nPrepare up to three gas-permeable culture dishes, of which the cell culture membrane is relatively flexible.\nCell line seeding\n\t\n24 hours before the start of the experiment, harvest PC3-EPI and PC3-EMT cells by trypsinization for 5 min. Add prewarmed culture media, then centrifuge at 150 x g for 3 min and discard the supernatant.\nCount cells of each PC3-EPI and PC3-EMT using a hemocytometer and isolate a total of 2.5 x 104 of each cell type for each gas-permeable culture dish.\nMix and resuspend the two cell types in 2 mL of culture media and seed the cells into each of the gas-permeable culture dish.\nLeave the entire plate holder in the incubator overnight for cells to attach.\nDisinfect the PDMS devices via UV exposure for at least 1 h and leave in a sterile environment.\nSetting up thermal control unit and gas supply system",
    "As shown in Figure 3, set up a gas supply system that consists of both CO2 and O2 control units, a gas pump, a gas mixing chamber, a humidifier or bubbler, and three separate sets of gas valves and pressure gauges. More details can be found in our previous work12.\nSet up the CO2 and O2 control units such that they adjust the mixing rate of the gas from CO2 and N2 tanks and the O2 source. Alternatively, any gas supply system that provides gas under normoxia condition would work.\nMake sure the gas that is combined in the mixing chamber and humidified by a bubbler such that the relative humidity is increased up to 85% (as read out from a relative humidity monitor) and that the gas leads to three independent gas valves with pressure gauges in order to control and monitor gas flow rate in the plate holder.\nPlace the entire plate holder in an on-stage incubation thermal control unit with separate heating subunits for the lid and the bottom plate, with all units set at 37 °C. See Table of Materials for more details.\nInstallation of microfluidic device. See Table of Materials for more details.\n\t\nIdentify that the detailed components of the 3-well plate holder are in order, as in Figure 2. Each of the three wells are identical and independent, with a pair of gas channels for each well. Every well possesses a gas-permeable culture dish holder, a PDMS chip holder, a glass window holder, and a pair of 35 mm glass windows. These components can be assembled using the fitted screws.",
    "NOTE: The glass windows ensure that there is a thermally-isolated space between the gas-permeable culture membrane and the well such that no water condensation occurs due to temperature differences at the interface. Note that the 3 wells are independent, and 3 experiments can be done separately.\nPre-warm culture medium at 37 °C and degas in a vacuum chamber for 20 min.\nTreat the PDMS chips using an oxygen plasma system for 30 s in order to maintain hydrophilicity.\nSet up the syringe system. Load two syringes slowly with growth media and other two syringes with desired reagent of interest (media, media with drug, etc.). Connect each individual syringe to a 50 cm tubing (0.020\" x 0.060\"OD) by a 23 G dispensing needle into one hollow steel pin. Insert a hollow steel pin into the other end of the tubing.\nPrime the tubing and insert the steel pin into each PDMS chip through the capping layer. Fill up the reservoir layer and wet the PDMS pattern layer pattern with media. The reservoir layer works as an on-chip bubble trap to prevent air bubbles from getting into the microfluidic pattern.\nLoad a 1 mL syringe with culture media. Connect the syringe to a 5 cm tubing (0.020\" x 0.060\"OD) by a 23 G dispensing needle into one hollow steel pin. Insert a hollow steel pin into the other end of the tubing and prime the tubing.\nInsert the hollow steel pin into the center hole of the chip, where excessive media can be extracted out from the chip later during the chip sealing process.\nAs each PDMS device requires four 10 mL syringes loaded onto a syringe pump, load two 10 mL syringes per chip in the forward deck. Place the two other syringes in the withdraw deck of the syringe system.",
    "Place chip directly on top of the gas-permeable culture membranes (with cells already adhered to the membranes). In order to avoid entrapping microbubbles in the microfluidic pattern, dispense 1 mL of prewarmed and degassed media into the 35 mm gas-permeable culture dish before assembly, and then make sure that the chip approaches the liquid surface with a 15-degree tilt angle.\nClamp the gas-permeable culture dish and the well in the gas-permeable culture dish holder for each chip, with the PDMS chip holder pushing the PDMS device downward.\nTape a sheet of a sealer on top of the PDMS device and clamp with the PDMS chip holder in order to prevent the chip from drying out.\nSet media flow rate around the array to be 20 µL/h.\nSet the entire plate in the on-stage incubator on the motorized stage of an inverted microscope. Connect the gas supply system to the gas channels and pressurizing the gas-permeable culture membrane against the installed PDMS chip to ensure sealing of device. Maintain gauge pressure at 0.2 psi (1.4 x 104 Pa).\nSlowly extract excessive media in the chip using the 1-mL syringe from the center hole. Observe the chip under the microscope while extracting media and then stop extracting when the chip is sealed. Chip sealing should be obvious since a part of the cells would be crushed by the micro-structures.\nConnect the temperature sensing unit of the on-stage incubator to the 3-well plate and set to 37 °C.\n4. Single-cell time-lapse imaging\nSet up imaging software utilizing an inverted microscope to time-lapse image acquisition. Note that an inverted fluorescent microscope with fully motorized x-y stage, focus knob, shutter, and filter cubes is required for an EA experiment.",
    "Configure software to acquire images across two channels at 10x magnification for each chip with automatic image-stitching after one round of autofocus. Be aware that automatic correction systems like Perfect Focus do not guarantee satisfying image quality. It is more recommended to generate a customized focus surface for long-term image acquisition based on either autofocus or manual focus across the chip.\nTake images every hour and leave experiment running on the time scale of weeks. Monitor image quality on a daily basis and update the focus surface if necessary.\nPrepare the PDMS chip and gas-permeable culture dish for subsequent immunofluorescent analysis, as described previously13.\n5. Image processing and analysis\nPost-experimental processing\n\t\nConvert images into TIFF format for image processing and measurements utilizing Fiji/ImageJ.\nCompress TIFF files for ease of further image processing.\nFiji/ImageJ analysis\n\t\nTo identify cells, perform Background Subtraction and Particle Analysis to identify fluorescent bright-spots for cell location detection and automatic cell counting.\nUtilize plugins (Manual Tracking, Chemotaxis, Migration Tool, Trackmate) to analyze cell motility and migration.\nSubscription Required.
