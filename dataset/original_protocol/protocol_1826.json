    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSeparation of mouse intestinal layers\nTiming: 15 min\nSeparation of myenteric and submucosal plexus.\nEuthanize mouse by cervical dislocation or other approved method.\nLay euthanized mouse on its back on a cold surface (e.g., metal dissection block placed on ice); spray abdominal area with 70% ethanol. Lift the skin of the lower abdomen with tweezers and make a V-shaped incision with scissors; cut away skin to expose abdominal cavity.\nLocate the beginning of the small intestine at the base of the stomach; cut the beginning of the small intestine from the stomach and carefully pull out from abdominal cavity, allowing mesenteric fat to peel away from intestine as it is pulled, and gently removing as much remaining fat as possible with tweezers.\nDivide the small intestine into four equal pieces; collect the ileum, which is the most distal fourth, approximately 6–7 cm of small intestinal tissue proximal to the beginning of the cecum).\nNote: To account for variation in neuronal density in different intestinal segments, analysis should always be performed with the same part of the small intestine (e.g., last 3 cm of the ileum).\nInsert scissors into intestinal opening; carefully pull intestine over scissor blade; make a straight cut to the right of the mesenteric attachment over the length of the tissue until intestine is fully opened (pulling the entire length of tissue onto the scissor blade allows fewer cuts and enables a straighter cut, which prevents tearing of the tissue during the layer separation).\nLocate the outside layer of the intestine (the smooth side with mesenteric attachment, as seen in Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] at 00:30 min and Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]); grip with tweezers and vigorously shake in a petri dish filled with PBS on ice to wash.",
    "Place the intestine on a cold surface (e.g., metal dissection block) with the muscularis (outer) layer facing up (luminal side facing down). Use small, damp paint brushes to completely flatten the tissue, making sure the sides don’t fold under (See Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] at 00:06 min).\nWith one pair of tweezers, grip the intestine at the beginning of the tissue segment, and use a second pair to gently make a dent in the tissue directly below the pair of gripping tweezers, making sure not to pierce through the entire thickness of the tissue (as seen in Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] at 00:45 min); carefully stroke downwards on the tissue from the indentation with second pair of tweezers until you see the layers separating, and the muscularis rolling away. Gradually adjusting both tweezers down the length of the tissue, keep scraping the muscularis layer away until you reach the end of the length tissue. See Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nNote: Depending on the experimental question, submucosal layer (tissue remaining after muscularis isolation) of the intestine can be similarly analyzed by flow cytometry or microscopy.\nStore tissue in PBS on ice until all animals are processed.\nDepending on the desired analysis, immediately continue with “flow cytometry preparation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3]” or “immunofluorescence preparation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2]”.\nNote: Flow cytometry and immunofluorescent analysis can be performed together for each sample. Use 1/3 of the tissue for imagining and 2/3 for flow cytometry. Make sure to use the same part of the tissue for each type of analysis (e.g., lower ileum for imaging and upper ileum for flow cytometry).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1418-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "Place tissue on a Sylgard-coated plate; stretch and flatten using damp paint brushes, avoiding any wrinkles or folds, and pin down with Minutien pins. See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1418-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Sylgard plate with multiple pinned fragments of ileum muscularis\nCover the pinned tissue with 4% PFA solution and keep at 4°C for 16 h.\nDiscard PFA solution and transfer tissue to a 24-well plate filled with PBS. Wash 4 times for 15 min per wash at 20°C–25°C on an orbital shaker, transferring tissue to a fresh well of PBS after each wash.\nTransfer tissue to 24-well plate filled with Permeabilization Buffer. Incubate at 20°C–25°C on an orbital shaker for 2 h, moving the tissue to a second PBS-filled well after 1 h.\nPause point: Tissue can be kept in Permeabilization Buffer at 4°C for up to 1 week. For longer storage (2 months) secure the plate with parafilm and keep tissue in Permeabilization Buffer supplemented with 0.05% sodium azide.\nTransfer tissue to 24-well plate filled with Blocking Buffer. Incubate at 20°C–25°C on an orbital shaker for 1 h.\nPrepare 600 μL of primary antibody solution per 4 cm piece of muscularis, diluted in Blocking Buffer. Place tissue in antibody solution in 24-well plate; seal with parafilm and incubate for 48 h at 4°C on a platform rocker.\nTransfer tissue to a 24-well plate filled with PBS. Wash 4 times for 15 min per wash at 20°C–25°C on an orbital shaker, transferring tissue to a new PBS-filled well after each wash.\nPrepare 600 μL of secondary antibody solution per 4 cm piece of muscularis, diluted in Permeabilization Buffer. Incubate tissue in solution in a 24-well plate for 2–3 h at 20°C–25°C, covered from light on an orbital shaker.",
    "Transfer tissue to a 24-well plate filled with PBS. Wash 4 times for 15 min per wash at 20°C–25°C on an orbital shaker, transferring tissue to a new PBS-filled well after each wash.\nTransfer tissue to a microscope slide, completely flatten with damp paint brushes, cover with a few drops of Fluoromount-G mounting medium and carefully place a coverslip on the tissue sample. Avoid introducing air bubbles by lowering the coverslip gradually from one side to the other.\nAllow slides to dry for 16 h in dark at 20°C–25°C, or until the media solidifies.\nOptional: For long-term storage (> 4 weeks) the slides can be sealed with nail polish.\nPause point: Stained slides may be stored in the dark at 4°C for at least 2 weeks prior to microscopy analysis.\nAcquire 10 randomly selected, evenly spaced, complete z-stacks for each slide.\nFor our studies, we used a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope with 25× glycerol objective, 0.6× zoom, 1 airy unit pinhole and 512 × 512 pixels xy resolution.\nFlow cytometry preparation\nTiming: 3–4 h\nIf analyzing the submucosa, remove Peyer’s patches with scissors or tweezers (there are 6–10 visible Peyer’s patches in the entire small intestine). See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nPlace tissue into a 6-well plate without liquid and use scissors to cut thoroughly into very fine (less than 0.5 mm) pieces, for approximately 15 s.\nAdd Digestion Buffer to the plate and place it on a shaker at 37°C. Use following times and Digestion Buffer volumes (longer digestion time is required for muscularis to ensure proper dissociation):\nMuscularis: 40 min in 4 mL.\nMucosae: 20 min in 6 mL.\nFollowing digestion, homogenize tissue with 18G needle/10 mL syringe by aspirating up and down twice.\nAdd 5 mL HBSS+5% FCS to each well.",
    "With a 10 mL serological pipet, filter the cell suspension through a 70 μm cell strainer directly into a 15 mL falcon tube. If 5–6 cm of tissue is analyzed, approximately 6 × 106 cells are recovered from muscularis and 10 × 106 from the submucosal layer.\nCentrifuge at 400 g for 5 min at 4°C, aspirate supernatant, resuspend the pellet in 100 μL of FACS buffer and pipette to transfer the cells to a round-bottom 96-well plate.\nCentrifuge plate at 400 g for 5 min at 4°C and remove supernatant by quickly inverting the plate over the sink.\nResuspend cells in 50 μL of surface antibody mix, diluted in FACS buffer. Incubate for 30 min on ice, covered from light.\nWash cells by adding 100 μL of FACS buffer to each well. Centrifuge plate at 400 g for 5 min at 4°C and remove supernatant by quickly inverting the plate over the sink.\nOptional: For intracellular staining, make Fix/Perm Buffer by diluting 1 part Fix/Perm Concentrate in 3 parts Fix/Perm Diluent from the Fixation/Permeabilization Solution Kit (See key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]). Resuspend cells in 50 μL of Fix/Perm Buffer and incubate for 30 min on ice, and covered from light. Wash cells by adding 100 μL of Perm buffer to each well. Centrifuge at 400 g for 5 min at 4°C and remove supernatant by quickly inverting the plate over the sink. Resuspend cells in 50 μL of intracellular antibody mix, diluted in Perm buffer (diluted 1:10 in water). Wash cells by adding 100 μL of Perm buffer to each well. Centrifuge at 400 g for 5 min at 4°C and remove supernatant by quickly inverting the plate over the sink.\nResuspend cells in 300 μL of FACS buffer and transfer to FACS tubes.\nAcquire samples on FACS machine.",
