A schematic flowchart for the fractionation method is shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2392-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. A schematic flowchart for the fractionation of cytosol and mitochondria from frozen tissue or cultured cells using a mitochondrial isolation kit\nWeigh frozen whole cerebral cortex tissues and cut into ∼50 mg sections using a blade on a pre-chilled platform with dry ice.\nPlace the cortex sections into pre-chilled 2.0 mL tubes (tubes A).\nKeep tubes A in liquid nitrogen or on dry ice until all samples to be analyzed have been processed.\nCritical: Do not thaw samples at this step.\nPrepare Reagent A and Reagent C solutions in the mitochondria isolation kit and add 1/100 volume of protease inhibitors to each solution. Keep them on ice.\nNote: After this step, a maximum of 6 samples may be processed simultaneously.\nNote: Once the protease inhibitors have been added, reagents A and C cannot be stored and must be used on the day of the experiment.\nAdd ice cold 500 μL Reagent A solution into tubes A.\nPerform homogenization using a Polytron Tissue Grinder (shaft size: 5.5 mm, speed: high) for 30 s while on ice.\nTo minimize sample-to-sample contamination in the homogenization, clean the tip of the homogenizer with 70% EtOH once and ddH2O twice between samples.\nCritical: Make sure the samples are completely homogenized by visually checking to see if there are any tissue fragments left or not. If tissues are not sufficiently homogenized, extend the homogenization time by 30 s and reassess homogenization.",
    "Note: Since this protocol is for measuring iron content rather than functional analysis, the addition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) is not required. Addition of BSA may complicate the process of measuring protein concentration in cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions. Alternatively, tissues may be homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer after mincing into small pieces.\nAfter homogenizing all samples, add 500 μL of Reagent C into tubes A.\nProceed to step 13 in the below section of “Isolation of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial fractions from cells”.\nNote: From this step, all samples may be processed simultaneously.\nIsolation of cytosolic and mitochondrial fraction from cells\nTiming: 3 h\nHarvest cultured cells into a cell suspension using trypsin or a different cellular dissociation method.\nThe number of cells required depends on the cell type; for example, the number of approximately 20 × 106 cells are needed for cultured H9c2 rat cardiomyoblasts.\nCollect cells in 15 mL conical tubes.\nGently wash the cell suspension in ice cold PBS twice, and transfer the suspension to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge at 1,000 g to pallet the cells (Tube A).\nDiscard the supernatant.\nPrepare Reagent A and Reagent C solutions in the mitochondria isolation kit and add 1/100 volume of protease inhibitors to each solution. Keep them on ice.\nNote: Mitochondrial isolation kits are available for tissue and cultured cells. In our experience, it is possible to substitute tissue kits for cellular mitochondrial isolation.\nAdd ice cold 500 μL Reagent A solution into tubes A.\nAdd 6.25 μL Reagent B solution into tubes A.\nVortex vigorously for 5 s every minute for 5 min.\nAdd 500 μL of Reagent C into tubes A and mix.\nCentrifuge tubes A at 700 g for 10 min at 4°C.",
    "Discard the pellet and transfer the supernatant to a new 2.0 mL tube (tubes B).\nCentrifuge tubes B at 3,000 g for 15 min at 4°C.\nNote: To collect additional mitochondria, centrifuge at 12,000 g instead 3,000 g; however, contamination of lysosomes and peroxisomes in the mitochondrial fraction will be greater.\nTransfer the supernatant (cytosolic fraction) into new 1.5 mL tubes (tubes C).\nWash the pellet with 250 μL of Reagent C and centrifuge tubes at 3,000 g for 10 min at 4°C.\nAdd 200 μL of PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1× Protease Arrest to the pellet of tubes B. This lysate contains the mitochondrial fraction.\nTake 10 μL of each fraction for BCA protein assay to determine protein concentrations.\nFreeze lysates in −20°C for a month or use for subsequent measurements directly.\nMeasurement of non-heme iron\nTiming: 3 h\nThis step describes the measurement of non-heme iron content in cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions. A schematic flowchart for the non-heme iron measurement is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2392-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. A schematic flowchart for non-heme iron measurement\nMix 5 mL of 1 N HCl and 5 mL of 10% Trichloroacetic acid in a Falcon™ 15 mL conical centrifuge tube to prepare the protein precipitation solution (PPS). PPS can be stored at 4°C for a week.\nDissolve 2.5 mg of Ferrozine (final concentration: 0.5 mM) and 1.2 g of sodium acetate (final concentration: 1.5 M) in 10 mL ddH2O and add 10 μL of thioglycolic acid (final concentration: 0.1% (v/v)) in another 15 mL conical centrifuge tube to prepare the chromogen solution (CS). CS should be made fresh for every assay.\nMix 80 μL of either the cytosolic or mitochondrial lysate fraction with 80 μL of PPS in 1.5 mL tubes (tubes D) and vortex well at room temperature.",
    "Heat tubes in a heating block at 95°C for 1 h.\nUse cap locks to prevent the tubes from opening and solution from evaporating during heating.\nDuring the heating step, prepare standards by diluting 1 mM FeSO4 solution in PPS in 1.5 mL tubes (0 μM, 0.25 μM, 0.5 μM, 1.0 μM 2.5 μM, 5 μM, 10 μM, 25 μM).\nPlace standards on ice for 2 min.\nCentrifuge standards and tubes D at 16,000 g at 4°C for 10 min.\nAfter 1 h of heating from step 23, take 100 μL of standards or supernatant from tubes D and place into a single well of clear 96-well assay plates.\nCritical: Avoid contamination with precipitation. Contamination of precipitants into the samples may affect measurement results.\nAdd 100 μL of CS into the lysate per well of a 96-well assay plate.\nIncubate at room temperature for 10 min.\nMeasure absorbance at 562 nm using a plate reader.\nNormalize values by dividing the amount of iron in 1 μL of sample by the amount of protein in 1 μL assessed by BCA method in section 19.\nMeasurement of heme iron\nTiming: 3 h\nThis step describes the measurement of heme iron content in cytosolic and mitochondrial fraction. A schematic flowchart for the heme iron measurement is shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2392-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. A schematic flowchart for heme iron measurement\nDissolve 1.8 g of oxalic acid in 10 mL ddH2O in a Falcon™ 15 mL conical centrifuge tube to prepare oxalic acid solution (OS, final concentration: 2.0 M). OS can be stored at 4°C.\nNote: Oxalic acid can precipitate at room temperature. If crystals precipitate, heat in the microwave for 5 s to dissolve the crystal before use.",
    "Mix 100 μL of lysates from the cytosolic or mitochondrial fraction with 100 μL of warm OS in 1.5 mL tubes (tubes E) and vigorously vortex at room temperature.\nPrepare heme standards. Dissolve 6.5 mg of hemin in 1 mL of DMSO (10 mM hemin), and dilute 10 μL of 10 mM hemin in 990 μL warm OS in a 1.5 mL tube (100 μM hemin standard).\nHeat heme-iron samples and heme standards in a heating block at 90°C for 30 min.\nCentrifuge samples and standards at 700 g for 10 min at 4°C.\nDilute 100 μM heme standards in 1:1 mixture of OS and PBS with 1% Triton to desired concentration, and serve as measurement standards (for example, 0 μM, 0.25 μM, 0.5 μM, 1.0 μM 2.5 μM, 5 μM, 10 μM, 25 μM).\nTransfer 150 μL of supernatant or heme standards into a black-walled clear bottom 96-well plate and quantify fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and an emission wavelength of 600 nm.\nNormalize values by dividing the amount of iron in 1 μL of sample by the amount of protein in 1 μL assessed by BCA method in section 19.\nCritical: Black wall assay plates were used to minimize well-to-well interference."
