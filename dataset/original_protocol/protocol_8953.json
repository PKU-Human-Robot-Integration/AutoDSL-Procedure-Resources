    "The following protocol complies with all the animal care guidelines of Yale University.\n1. Reagents and Equipment Preparation\nRecording equipment setup (Figure 1A).\n\t\nChoose a room for rig setup that is free of large variations in temperature or humidity and also isolated from sources of electrical and mechanical noise, such as refrigerators and centrifuges.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51355/51355fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. (A) Overview of recording rig setup. Stereomicroscope (a) is mounted on anti-vibration platform (b). Reference electrode holder (c) is mounted on platform opposite the headstage (d), via micromanipulators. An outlet plastic tube (e) delivering humidified air stream directed at the fly preparation is also mounted on the platform. The headstage is connected to the amplifier (f), which is connected to the digital acquisition system (DAS) (g), which is connected to a PC (h). (B) Configuration of electrodes and outlet tube: reference electrode on the left, recording electrode on the right, and air stream outlet tube directed at fly preparation.

Connect a small aquarium pump to bubble air through the water in the flask, generating a humidified air stream through the outlet plastic tube towards the fly.",
    "Mount fiber optic light source off the vibration table, orienting the outputs to illuminate the preparation by reflecting light via a piece of white card paper directly below the preparation. Ensure that the light source does not rest on the table. Note: the benefit of reflecting the light source on a paper disc is two-fold: it improves the contrast, making sensilla easier to visualize, and it prevents heating of the preparation that would result from direct light.\nPlug tastePROBE amplifier into the digital acquisition system (DAS), and the DAS into a personal computer, according to supplier manual. Plug foot pedal trigger in and arrange under workspace. Note: Electrically isolated wall sockets for the amplifier and DAS are highly desirable.\nElectrically ground microscope, micromanipulators, and light source by connecting metal components to table using alligator clips and lengths of insulated electrical wire and electrical tape. Electrically ground metal platform by connecting to building ground or DAS, which is grounded through power supply plug.\nInstall appropriate acquisition software for the DAS of choice on the personal computer. Note: Ensure that the digital acquisition drivers are compatible with the operating system on the PC.\nConfigure software amplification (10-100x), signal filtering (typically a Bessel bandpass filter set from 100 Hz-3,000 Hz), and sampling rate (at least 10 KHz). Note: Signal amplitudes from gustatory neurons are typically in the 0.5-2 mV range, so the display scale is set to facilitate their visualization. Note: The 100 Hz filter helps to exclude extraneous electrical noise; however, it changes the shape of spikes and can make advanced spike sorting more challenging. Alternatively, a 1 Hz filter can be used.",
    "Optionally, a Faraday cage can be set up around the whole vibration table. However, small sheets of aluminum foil are usually sufficient to reduce any noise generated by the external environment or investigator.\nGlass Electrode Preparation\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51355/51355fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Reference and recording electrodes.

Click here to view larger image.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51355/51355fig2highres.jpg]\nPull the reference electrode from a glass capillary using a pipette puller instrument. Note: The exact settings of the pipette puller program will vary from instrument to instrument. Try to achieve a very long gradual taper. The pore size at the tip is not crucial because the tip will be broken before fly preparation (Figures 2A and 2B); however, make sure that the diameter of the tapered length of the electrode is neither too thin, which will not allow for sufficient immobilization of the labellum, nor too large, which could damage the gustatory neurons or rupture the salivary glands.\nPull recording electrode from a borosilicate glass capillary with filament using a pipette puller instrument. Try to achieve a taper that is shallower than that of the reference electrode, and a pore diameter of approximately 10-15 μm (Figure 2C)28.\nTastant solutions preparation\n\t\nUse Beadle-Ephrussi Ringer solution (B&E) as the reference electrode electrolyte. To make one liter of B&E, dissolve 7.5 g NaCl, 0.35 g KCl, and 0.279 g CaCl2∙2H2O in one liter of ultrapure water. Store smaller aliquots at -20 °C.",
    "Use 30 mM tricholine citrate solution (TCC) as the recording electrode electrolyte and solvent for tastant solutions25, if bitter or sugar GRN responses are to be measured. Alternatively, 1-3 mM potassium chloride solution can be used if responses of the water cell are to be measured.\nTo make tastant solutions, weigh appropriate amount of tastant in powder form and add to TCC to make an initial stock concentration. Use this to make serial dilutions from this initial stock to yield the desired concentration for testing. Note: If tastants do not readily dissolve in water, another solvent, such as ethanol, can be used to make initial stock concentration. An appropriate control solution of TCC and solvent without tastant should be used in this case.\nStore aliquots long term at -20 °C. Store one working aliquot of a tastant solution at 4 °C for recording use for up to a week, depending on chemical properties of tastant.\n2. Drosophila Preparation\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51355/51355fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Preparation of fly for recording.

(C,D) Fly with reference electrode in final position with tip of electrode inside labellum, and proboscis fully extended. Click here to view larger image.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51355/51355fig3highres.jpg]\nCollect newly eclosed flies for recording from well-maintained fly cultures, grown under temperature- and humidity-controlled conditions, and age them 5-10 days in fresh culture vials before recording.\nChill microscope plate on ice for 15-30 min before preparing fly.",
    "Backfill glass reference electrode with B&E solution using a long, thin plastic needle of 0.5 mm diameter, such as a spinal needle and 1 ml syringe and gently tap out any bubbles. Break small amount of tip off using forceps and use capillary action to draw out all remaining bubbles with a tissue, observing under dissecting microscope.\nSlide B&E-filled reference electrode onto wire of reference electrode holder, taking care not to introduce air bubbles.\nAspirate fly into a P200 pipette tip, using fly aspirator built from tubing, mesh, and pipette tip;29 place in ice bucket and chill for 30-60 sec.\nRemove microscope plate from ice, wipe off any moisture, and position underneath microscope. Gently tap fly out of pipette tip onto microscope plate.\n\tNote: the fly should be sufficiently immobilized to manipulate easily.\nUnder low magnification, gently remove the forelegs with one pair of forceps, while holding the thorax stable with the other pair of forceps. Position the fly on its ventral side, dorsal side facing up. Note: Always be careful to avoid touching the labellum with the forceps at all times during the preparation process to minimize mechanical damage.\nWhile holding the fly in place with one pair of forceps, insert the reference electrode at the midline of the posterior dorsal thorax. A suggested angle of entry is approximately forty-five degrees, in the direction of the head (Figure 3A).\nSecure the reference electrode holder with modeling clay such that the fly is visible underneath the microscope at high magnification. Maneuver and angle the glass electrode through the neck and head, by sliding the fly towards the reference electrode holder using two pairs of forceps. Note: Work quickly but smoothly; it is easier to complete this step while the fly is still immobilized from the cold (Figure 3B).",
    "Gently extend the proboscis with one pair of forceps, while sliding the fly further down the glass reference electrode, until the tip of the electrode is inside the labellum and the proboscis is fully extended (Figures 3C and 3D). Note: Take care not to puncture any part of the proboscis tissue or distend the edge of the labellum with the reference electrode, as this may damage the fly and/or taste neurons and affect the recording quality.\n3. Recording from Labellar Sensilla\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51355/51355fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Recording from fly.

Note: It is extremely important not to deliver a static charge to the headstage as that can damage the circuitry.\nSecure reference electrode holder to micromanipulator mounted on air table of recording rig. Position one lobe of labellum in microscope field of view, under high magnification (typically at least 140X), and in line with humidified air stream.\nTurn on humidified air stream, computer, DAS, and amplifier. Open acquisition software.\nRinse and fill glass recording electrode with desired tastant.\n\t\nRinse glass recording electrode with ultrapure water by using a syringe and plastic tubing28 to pull small amounts of water through the tube at least ten times.\nRinse recording electrode with tastant at least five times. Fill recording electrode approximately one-third to halfway full with tastant and remove from tubing. If there are air bubbles, tap to release or simply refill the electrode.",
    "Slide electrode onto silver wire of the headstage quickly and smoothly so as not to introduce air bubbles.\nStimulate single sensillum with tastant-filled recording electrode.\n\t\nUse the micromanipulator to bring the recording electrode aligned with sensillum of interest.\nPress foot pedal to trigger acquisition mode of the amplifier.\nAdvance the recording electrode with the fine control knob of micromanipulator carefully until it makes contact with tip of sensillum and recording commences.\nRemove electrode after 1-2 sec.\nRepeat step 3.5 with other sensilla, if desired. Note: Wait at least 1 min in between presentations to the same sensillum. If recording with a single tastant for a prolonged period of time, the tastant solution may dry out and the solution in the tip may become more concentrated. This can be remedied by gently contacting the tip of the glass electrode with smooth paper to remove a small amount of liquid by capillary action.\nTo record responses to another tastant, rinse and load recording electrode with new tastant and repeat step 3.4. Note: Thoroughly rinsing the electrode between tastants is absolutely crucial to avoid cross-contamination.\nSave data files periodically with identifying information, such as date, genotype, and tastants. Note: It is important to keep a written record of the tastant and sensillum identity of each presentation during recording session for data analysis.\nSubscription Required.
