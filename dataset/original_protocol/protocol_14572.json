    "1. Oligonucleotide library design and preparation\nLibrary design\n\t\nBased on the following criteria design a library of quenched fluorescent oligonucleotide probes between 8 and 12-mer long to avoid secondary structure formation, with equal length for all probes.\n\t\t\nInclude at least one DNA and one RNA random sequence containing a combination of adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C) and thymine (T)/uracil (U) (DNA and RNA probes in Table 1).\n\t\t\tNOTE: The DNA and RNA sequences described in Table 1 have been useful as the initial substrates for classifying an unknown type of nuclease activity, either DNase or RNase. These two sequences are recommended as the starting point for any screening, as they have shown a wide capability to detect nuclease activity profiles in bacteria and tissue samples. If nuclease activity is not observed with these DNA and RNA sequences, the design of additional oligonucleotides is required.\nInclude polynucleotide sequences consisting of a single type of nucleotide to determine sequence dependence for a given nuclease activity (DNA-Poly A, DNA-Poly T, DNA-Poly C, DNA-Poly G, RNA-Poly A, RNA-Poly U, RNA-Poly C and RNA-Poly G in Table 1).\nUsing the same sequence of nucleotide residues as the initial DNA and RNA sequences, include sequences that contain nucleoside analogs harboring chemical modifications at the 2'-position of the ribose sugar, such as 2'-Fluoro and 2'-O-Methyl, as a stringent step for increasing the selectivity of the nucleases.\n\t\t\t\nInclude fully modified sequences consisting entirely of 2'-Fluoro nucleoside analogs or 2'-O-Methyl nucleoside analogs (All 2'-F and All 2'-OMe, Table 1)\nInclude chimeric sequences consisting of unmodified natural purines and 2'-Fluoro pyrimidine nucleoside analogs (RNA Pyr-2'F, Table 1).\nInclude chimeric sequences consisting of unmodified natural purines and 2'-O-Methyl pyrimidine nucleoside analogs (RNA Pyr-2'OMe, Table 1).",
    "Include chimeric sequences consisting of unmodified natural pyrimidines and 2'-Fluoro purine nucleoside analogs (RNA Pur-2'F, Table 1).\nInclude chimeric sequences consisting of unmodified natural pyrimidines and 2'-O-Methyl purine nucleoside analogs (RNA Pur-2'OMe, Table 1).\nOligonucleotide probe preparation and storage\n\tNOTE: Oligonucleotides are synthesized by the phosphoramidite method. After synthesis, the oligonucleotides are purified using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the mass is measured by mass spectrometry.\n\t\nSpin down the lyophilized oligonucleotide probes using a centrifuge and dilute them in Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer to prevent nuclease degradation. Determine the dilution volume according to the yield of each probe to render a stock solution with a concentration of 500 pmol/μL.\nStore lyophilized oligonucleotides at 4 °C or room temperature for a short term. For long term storage (months to years), store lyophilized oligonucleotides at -20 °C. Upon resuspension of lyophilized oligonucleotides in TE, store the stock solutions at -20 °C or, preferably, at -80 °C.\n2. Bacterial culture\nTake one porous glass bead from the cryogenic storage vial under sterile conditions.\nTo isolate individual bacterial colonies (Salmonella and E. coli), use the quadrant method24 by streaking/rolling the bead directly onto a Petri dish containing Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA) medium supplemented with defibrinated sheep blood.\nIncubate the culture at 37 °C for 24 h.\n3. Supernatant preparation\nTransfer a single colony from solid media to 50 mL Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) and incubate at 37 °C for 24 h at 200 rpm.\nDilute the culture (1:500) in TSB (sub-culture) and incubate at 37 °C for 24 h at 200 rpm in a shaking incubator.\n\tNOTE: It is expected that after 24 h of incubation the bacterial cultures are in stationary phase reaching values higher than 109 CFU/mL.",
    "After the incubation period, transfer the cultures to capped sterile tubes and centrifuge at 4,500 x g for 30 min.\nCollect the supernatant and use it immediately. Alternatively, store the supernatants at 4 °C or -20 °C.\n4. Nuclease Activity Assay\nPreparation of working solutions\n\t\nPrepare a 20 μL working solution for each probe in 1.5 mL nuclease free microcentrifuge tubes by diluting (1:10 ratio) the stock solution (500 pmol/μL) for a final working concentration of 50 pmol/ μL. For that purpose, mix 18 μL of Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) containing MgCl2 and CaCl2 with 2 μL of probe stock solution.\n\t\tNOTE: Be aware that in the working solution, the oligonucleotides are more vulnerable to nuclease degradation, therefore, it is recommended to prepare the working solutions just before setting up the reaction.\nAvoid direct light contact during the preparation and keep in the dark (wrapped in foil), when dealing with fluorophores.\nReaction set up\n\t\nPre-warm the fluorometer (e.g. Cytation 1) to 37 °C.\nPrepare a set (one tube/probe) of 1.5 mL nuclease free microcentrifuge tubes for each sample (TSB, E. coli and Salmonella) and label accordingly.\nCarefully add 96 μL of TSB sterile culture media, Salmonella supernatant or E. coli supernatant (from the step 3.4.). Subsequently, add 4 μL/tube of probe working solution accordingly. Perform this step at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: 10 probes were used for the first round of the screening and 6 probes for the second round.\nMix thoroughly by pipetting up and down to obtain a homogenous solution. Avoid introducing air bubbles into the samples while mixing.",
    "Load 95 μL of each solution (probe + supernatant or culture media) into a separate well of a black bottom, non-treated 96 well plate. Minimize the formation of bubbles in the wells upon loading by dispensing carefully with the tip close to the wall of the well.\nCover the plate with its lid. Visually inspect the lid and check for pen markings or dust particle accumulation that may introduce measurement artifacts. Replace the lid for a new one if that is the case.\nMeasurement set up\n\t\nOpen the acquisition software (Gen5 3.05) by clicking the software shortcut icon (Figure S1A).\nSelect Read Now from the task manager window and choose New… to create the kinetic measurement protocol (Figure S1B).\nClick on Set Temperature in the dialog window titled Procedure and select 37 ˚C.

However, any other programs can be used to generate graphs from the raw data obtained, by plotting RFU versus time.\nCalculate the rate of the enzymatic reaction for each measured interval according to the following formula25: rate= imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60005/60005eq1.jpg, where If is RFU at the maximal interval time point and Ii is RFU at the minimal interval time point, and Tf and Ti are the maximal and minimal interval time points, respectively.",
