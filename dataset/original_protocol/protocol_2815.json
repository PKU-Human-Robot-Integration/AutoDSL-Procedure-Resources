    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\n      We here describe an automatable model for adipogenic differentiation,\n      suited for high throughput screening. In short, sheets are made by\n      pipetting 5 μL of a cell/alginate mixture in the middle of a PDL coated\n      well of 96-well plate. Polymerization of the alginate is initialized by a\n      short wash with a gelation buffer. Differentiation medium is added, and\n      medium is exchanged weekly over a four-week period. At the end of the\n      differentiation period, cells are fixed, stained with a lipid stain and\n      the differentiation efficiency is assessed using a high content analyzer\n      (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\n    \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2517-Fig2.jpg\n          Figure 2. Schematic overview of the protocol workflow\n        \n          This scheme gives an overview of the different steps performed to\n          perform alginate sheet differentiation. The protocol starts with\n          coating the plates with poly-D-lysine (PDL) and making the sheets.\n          Differentiation medium is added on day 0 and changed once a week.\n          After 4 weeks, sheets are fixed, stained and analyzed with a high\n          content analysis device.\n        \nPreparing cell/alginate sheets\nTiming: 5 min hands-on time and 15 min\n      run-time per 96-well plate\n    \n      Preparing the alginate sheets is the most critical step for the success of\n      the protocol described here, though the general steps are simple:\n      cell/alginate mixture is transferred to the center of the well using a p20\n      8-channel pipette, then the sheets are washed with a gelation buffer and\n      excess gelation buffer is washed away with cell culture media.

    "is strongly advised to add 1 mM CaCl2 to the wash buffers and\n      the differentiation media.\n    \nAlternatives: All steps described\n      can be done as well manually. To ensure that sheets are placed in the\n      middle of the well, we suggest using a single channel pipette for\n      dispensing the cell/alginate mixture, instead of the 8-channel option used\n      on the liquid handler. For gelation and washing, a multichannel pipette\n      can be used and is best placed at the sides of the wells to ensure that\n      the liquids flow slow and constant over the cell/alginate mixture to not\n      disturb the sheet before proper gelation takes place. As soon as the\n      alginate gelated, sheets are stable and no special precautions have to be\n      taken. In our experience, they can be treated like standard 2D cultures\n      from this point onwards.\n    \n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \n          Methods video S1.

For the fixation and staining protocol, we have a liquid handler\n      unit installed under a fume hood. In case this is not possible, we\n      recommend performing fixation manually or using a non-toxic fixative."
