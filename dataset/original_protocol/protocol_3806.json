Harvest supernatants containing viral particles 48 h after the medium change by collecting the supernatants in a 15-mL sterile tube. Keep everything on ice at all times.\nPellet nonadherent cells and cell debris by centrifugation at 1600 × g at 4°C for 10 min and pass the supernatant through a sterile, 0.45-μM low-protein binding filter(Joshi et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nCritical: To obtain high-quality lentivirus, HEK293T should be at rapid growth stage, and the cells should be transfected at 70%–80% confluency.\nConcentrate viral particles by ultracentrifugation.\nTransfer approximately 10 mL lentiviral supernatant to SW-41 ultracentrifuge tubes containing 1.5 mL of 20% sucrose cushion in PBS (w/v). Perform this step slowly to avoid mixing the layers.",
    "Bring a scale into the biosafety cabinet and balance the tubes in the metal bucket. by adding media with virus particles until the tubes are at no more than 0.01 g apart in weight and are filled until 2 mm from the top (also see Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nConcentrate lentiviral particles by centrifugation in an SW-41 rotor at 100000 × g for 2 h at 4°C (the virions will be in the pellet at the bottom of the tube).\nRemove the supernatant carefully!\nResuspend the pellet in 200 μL of 1× HBSS buffer.\nImmediately titrate the samples and prepare 50 μL aliquots. The aliquots can be stored at −80°C for at least 1 years.\nClean the biosafety cabinet with 10% bleach and then 70% EtOH. Treat the used pipettes and tips with 70% EtOH from biohazardous contamination.\nCritical: This whole process should be performed on ice to maintain the viability of virus. Concentrated virus should be stored at −80°C in single-use aliquots to avoid freezing and thawing (Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).\nLentivirus titration\nTitrate lentivirus using the qPCR Lentivirus Titration Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions: https://www.abmgood.com/qpcr-lentivirus-titration-titer-kit-lv900-vin.html[href=https://www.abmgood.com/qpcr-lentivirus-titration-titer-kit-lv900-vin.html]\nFor functional titration, titrate lentiviruses expressing Cre by infecting the CAG-Loxp-mCherry-Loxp-ZsGreen cell line (termed the Cre reporter).\nSeed 1×104 Cre reporter cells with 100 μL DMEM complete medium in a 96-well plate.\nSerially dilute the virus 10-fold and replace the medium with 100 μL diluted virus. Count the number of ZsGreen-positive cell colonies 3 days after the medium change.\nUse the two smallest colony numbers to calculate the titer with the following formula: titer = (smallest colony number × dilution rate + the second smallest colony number × dilution rate) ×100/2 TU/mL.\nLung Intratracheal intubation (also see the Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1])",
    "Sedate a KrasLox-STOP-Lox(LSL)-G12D;Trp53flox/flox; ZsGreenflox/flox mouse (6–8 weeks of age) by intraperitoneal injection of Avertin (female 0.4 mg/g, male 0.45 mg/g of body weight).\nWhile anesthesia sets in, prepare the catheter for intubation. First, blunt the needle of the catheter by cutting the end with scissors. Then, push the catheter completely over the end of the needle.\nConfirm the appropriate level of anesthesia by pedal reflex via firm toe pinching.\nFix the mouse on the intubation platform by hooking its upper incisors over a suture and confirm that the chest is vertical underneath the suture.\nPlace a fiber optic cable between the front legs to illuminate the chest.\nCarefully open the mouth of the mouse and pull out the tongue using disinfected flat forceps. Look for the emission of white light to locate the larynx and visualize the epiglottis and arytenoid cartilages.\nOnce the opening of the trachea is clearly visible, gently slide the catheter into the trachea. The length of the catheter to be inserted depends on the age and size of the animal, since it should not go below the bifurcation to guarantee an even distribution of lung adenocarcinoma cells within the lung. Quickly remove the needle from the catheter.\nThe proper placement of the catheter in the trachea is indicated by white light shining through the catheter. To confirm the placement of the catheter in the trachea, attach a 1-mL syringe containing water to the catheter. The water in the syringe will rapidly move up and down in accordance with the breathing.\nPipette 50 μL of the suspension containing 105–106 TU virus per mouse into the center of the catheter hub. The suspension should be aspirated immediately. Subsequently, attach a 1-mL syringe and dispense 300 μL of air to ensure a consistent distribution within the lungs.",
    "Gently remove the catheter, remove the mouse from the intubation platform, and place it on a heat pad until it recovers from anesthesia.\nTen weeks later, sacrifice the mice and isolate the lungs with adenocarcinoma for histological examinations and Tumor derived cell line (TDCL) establishment.\nCritical: To ensure that tumors are evenly distributed in the lung, viruses should be evenly distributed within the lungs. We recommend dispensing 300 μL of air to the trachea after pipetting the virus. The concentration of virus and the time should be recorded (Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1.

    "Culture the cells for 14 days and pick individual colonies using microscopy.\nMouse subcutaneous allograft injection\nTiming: 25 days\nThis protocol describes how to establish the subcutaneous allograft mouse model and monitor tumor growth in vivo using mouse tumor cells derived from GEMMs.\nExpand the cells.\nSeed TDCL cells in 10cm well 24 h before transplantation at approximately 50% confluency in RPMI-1640 complete medium. Incubate the cell cultures at 37°C, 5% CO2, and approximately 95% relative humidity.\nOn the next day, harvest the cells using 1 mL of trypsin-EDTA (0.05% in PBS) at 37°C for 5 min per 10-cm plate and, subsequently, resuspend the detached cells with 9 mL of RPMI-1640 complete medium.\nCount the cells in a hemocytometer and transfer the number of cells needed for the experiments in a 50-mL conical centrifuge tube.\nSubsequently, centrifuge the cells for 5 min at 300 × g, aspirate the supernatant, and, using a pipette, resuspend the cells at a density of 7.5 × 106/mL (for the injection of 1.5 × 106 TDCL cells per mouse) in PBS.\nKeep the cells on ice until transplantation.\nPerform subcutaneous injection.\nPrepare C57BL/6 male mice at the age of 6–8 weeks.\nMix the cell suspension and subcutaneously implant 200 μL of the suspension containing 1.5 × 106 cells (the number of cells may vary) in the right flank of each mouse.\nOnce the tumor volume reaches 50–100 mm3 (6–8 days), randomly separate the tumor-bearing mice into two groups.\nNote: We recommend using mice of the same genetic background and sex as the donor of tumor cells to guarantee the recipient mice tolerant well to the tumor cells.\nMeasure the tumor volume.",
    "Determine the tumor volumes by measuring the length (l) and width (w) with a Vernier caliper every other day and calculating the volume with the formula (V = 0.5 × l × w2).\nAt the end of the experiment (approximately 25 days), the mice are sacrificed, and tumors are isolated by dissection, weighed and used for in vitro experiments.\nNote: The mean tumor diameter should not exceed 20 mm according to the tumor burden guideline.\nAnti-PD-1 treatment\nTiming: 3 weeks\nThis section describes anti-PD-1 antibody treatment in tumor-bearing mice and how to monitor the tumor volume. We recommend using mice of the same sex and age to reduce individual differences.\nIntraperitoneally inject mice with 0.2 mg anti-PD-1 antibody(aPD-1) or Isotype control (IgG) 3 days after inoculation and treat every 3 days.\nMonitor the tumor volume with calipers every 2–3 days to ensure that the tumor volume does not exceed the ethical requirements for animal protection.\nTumor-infiltrating lymphocyte isolation\nTiming: 1 day\nThis step included dissection of the tumor tissue, dissociation of the tumor into single-cell suspension and lymphocyte isolation. We recommend using freshly isolated tumor tissue and that the processing time is minimal to ensure cell viability.\nClean and sterilize surgical instruments, filters, and containers.\nSacrifice the mice, dissect the tumors and carefully remove the skin. Cut 0.5 g tumor tissue for lymphocyte isolation, transfer the tumor tissue to a 50-mL tube with 1 mL FBS free DMEM and keep on ice till all the tumor tissue is dissected. It often takes 1 h for one person to dissect 10 mice.\nGently cut the tumor into approximately 1-mm diameter pieces using scissors (perform this step within 2 min).\nPrepare the digestion solution\nAdd 5 mL PBS to sterilized bottle.\nAdd 50 μL 25 mg/mL Collagenase IV.",
    "Add 20 μL 1 mM DNase I.\nMix well by shaking\nAdd 5 mL digestion buffer to the 50-mL tube which containing tumor pieces, and incubate the sample in a shaker at 200 rpm for 1 h at 37°C.\nCritical: This step should be performed very gently and quickly. Cell viability will decrease sharply if the procedure is too long. Note that the quality of collagenase is also crucial and determines the quantity and activity of cells.\nObtain a single-cell suspension.\nAdd 15 mL PBS to stop the digestion.\nRepeatedly pipette the tissue suspension with a dropper.\nPass the tissue suspension through a 200-mesh filter and then collect the cell suspension.\nLyse blood cells.\nPrecool the centrifuge to 4°C.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 460 × g for 5 min to collect the cell pellet.\nDiscard the supernatant, resuspend the cells in 1 mL ACK lysis buffer and place on ice for 1 min.\nAdd 10 mL PBS to stop the lysis and centrifuge the cell suspension at 460 × g for 5 min.\nPrepare 40% (v/v) Percoll gradient solution.\nAdd 6 mL serum free DMEM to a sterilized bottle.\nAdd 0.4 mL 10 × PBS.\nAdd 3.6 mL Percoll.\nMix well by swirling.\nDiscard the supernatant, resuspend the cells in 10 mL 40% (v/v) Percoll gradient solution, and centrifuge the cell suspension at 550 × g for 35 min.\nCarefully remove the supernatant, which contains a large number of tumor cells, with a dropper. The resulting cell pellet is enriched for lymphocytes.\nResuspend the pellet in 10 mL PBS and centrifuge at 460 × g for 5 min to wash the cells.",
    "Discard the supernatant, resuspend the pellets in 1 mL DMEM containing 3% FBS, and count the living cells by trypan blue staining. Transfer equal numbers of living cells (5 × 106 is recommended) to 1.5-mL tubes for further flow cytometry analysis (Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]).\nFlow cytometry analysis\nTiming: 2 days\nDay 1\nPrepare culture medium with cytokine stimulations reagents.\nAdd 0.6 mL DMEM with 10% FBS.\nAdd 0.6 μL 0.5 mg/mL PMA stock.\nAdd 0.6 μL 1 mM Ionomycin stock.\nAdd 0.6 μL golgi inhibitor stock.\nMix well by vortexing.\nCentrifuge the lymphocytes at 460 × g for 5 min at 4°C, discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellets with 600 μL culture medium containing stimulations reagents.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 24-well plate and incubate the cells in 5% CO2 at 37°C for 3 h.\nStain for flow cytometry\nAllow lymphocytes to attach to the bottom of the plates, resuspend and transfer the cells to 96-well plates. Centrifuge the 96-well plate at 460 × g for 2 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.

Pass the cell suspension through a 200-mesh filter and analyze with a BD Verse cytometer.\nRefer to Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] for the gating strategy. We recommend collecting 10,000 CD8+ T cells for further analysis (Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]).\nNote: Isotype control is recommended for cytokine staining, it helps you estimate the non-specific binding. For markers that are clearly bimodal, such as CD45 and CD8, there is no need to set up isotype controls.\nImmunofluorescence analysis of CD8+ T cells\nTiming: 2 days\nDay 1\nThis protocol describes how to process tumor tissue into slices and perform CD8+ T cell immunofluorescence to evaluate CD8+ T cell infiltration per tumor area.\nEmbed the tissue.\nFix the freshly isolated tumor tissues with 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 4°C for 12 h.",
    "Critical: For CD8 staining, the concentration of PFA is critical, and over 2% will result in a weak CD8 signal (Liu et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nIncubate the tissue with PBS (2 h), PBS with 15% sucrose (w/v) (2 h) and PBS with 30% sucrose (8 h) until the tissues are fully dehydrated.\nPlace the dehydrated tissue in an embedding box, add OCT until the tissue is fully covered and seal the box.
