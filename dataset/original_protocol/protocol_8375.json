    "All of the live animals were kept in a specific pathogen free (SPF) animal facility, approved and overseen by IACUC of Academia Sinica.\n1. Fixation\nCollect embryos of embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) then decapitate and eviscerate them.\nFix the embryos individually in 24-well plates with 1 mL/well of freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in 1x phosphate buffer saline (PBS) overnight. Incubate at 4 °C on a shaker.\nWash the fixed embryos at least 3x, each for 5-10 min, with 1 mL of 1x PBS and incubate overnight at 4 °C on a shaker to remove the residual paraformaldehyde.\n2. Whole-mount Immunostaining\nPermeabilize each embryo in 1 mL of 0.5% PBS-Triton-X-100 (PBST) overnight at 4 °C on a shaker.\nBlock each sample with 1 mL of 10% FBS prepared in 1x PBS overnight at 4 °C on a shaker.\nIncubate the embryo with 1 mL of anti-GFP primary antibody (1:1,000 dilution in 10% FBS) at 4 °C for 72 h with constant shaking to intensify the GFP signal of motor nerves.\nAfter the primary antibody incubation, wash with 1 mL of 0.5% PBST over the course of 1-2 days at 4 °C on a shaker, changing the 0.5% PBST at least three times.\nApply 1 mL of secondary antibody (1:1,000 dilution in 10% FBS) and incubate overnight in the dark at 4 °C with constant shaking.\nWash 3x with 1 mL of 0.5% PBST at 4 °C on a shaker over the course of 2-3 days. Keep samples in 1x PBS at 4 °C until the day before imaging.\n\tNOTE: Embryos can be dissected into smaller segments before clearing, depending on which part of the embryos will be imaged. Forelimbs are preserved in this experimental approach (Figure 1A).",
    "Incubate the embryo in a commercial clearing reagent with a refractive index of 1.49 nD in a 1.5 mL tube, protected from light at room temperature overnight, to render the embryo transparent for imaging.\n\tNOTE: The volume of the clearing reagent is approximately five times that of the sample volume.\n3. LSFM (2–3 h)\nSample set-up\nSet up 5X/0.1 illumination optics and 5X/0.16 detection optics. Assemble the sample holder and sample capillary (1.5 mm internal diameter, green) and place them into the microscope.\n\t\tNOTE: Refer to the microscope's Operating Manual for detailed set-up procedures.\nMount the embryo as follows:\n\t\t\nPrepare the P200 pipette tip by cutting away the upper part so that it fits the diameter of the capillary and remove the pointed part (~ 3 mm) for the sample attachment.\nMelt the blunted end of the pipette tip using a small flame.\nExtinguish the flame and quickly attach the embryo vertically onto the melted end.\nFit the upper part of the pipette tip with the sample capillary.\nAllow the chamber buffer to equilibrate with the embryo for 1 min to clear off debris or bubbles.\nUsing the imaging software, select Locate capillary under the Locate tab and adjust the x, y, z axes to position the sample capillary.\nSelect Locate sample and zoom to 0.6X to focus on the embryo. Rotate the embryo to ensure that the long axis of the imaged limb aligns with the light path of the two light sources (Figure 1B).\nImage acquisition\nUnder the Acquisition tab, define the light path parameters such as detection objectives, laser blocking filter, beam splitter, cameras, and lasers.\n\t\tNOTE: The GFP channel is used in this experiment (Excitation wavelength: 488 nm; emission filter: BP 505 to 545 nm, beam splitter: SPS LP 560).",
    "Check the pivot scan checkbox for shadow reduction.\nDefine the acquisition settings: bit depth, 16 bit; zoom, 0.36-0.7X; single-side illumination (left/right) or dual-side illumination.\nClick Continuous and set the laser intensity, exposure time, laser power, and light sheet position to acquire sharper images.\n\t\tNOTE: The laser power is kept as low as possible to minimize photodamage.\nPress STOP to end image acquisition.\nMultidimensional acquisition\nDefine the z-stack by moving the Z position for the first and last image. Click Optimal to set the slice number.\nClick Start Experiment to acquire the selected z-stack.\nWhen it is done, save the image in .czi format.\nImage processing (optional)\nProceed with Dual side fusion under the Lightsheet Processing channel if dual-side illumination is applied. Multiview processing is necessary if multi-views are acquired to combine images from multiple angles.\nCreate a 2D image using data from the highest intensity pixels along the projection axis under the Maximum Intensity Projection channel.\nUnder Copy channel, click Subset to select subsets of images from the original set.\n4. Quantification of Axon Arborization (30 Min for Each Individual Nerve)\nOpen the image file in the imaging analysis software (by default, the image containing the XYZ data is opened in Surpass mode and as a 3D-rendered view).\nAdjust the image color, brightness, and contrast using the Display Adjustment window (Edit | Show Display Adjustment) to detect filaments based on local intensity contrast.\nClick on the Add New Filaments icon and select the Autopath (no loop) algorithm in the drop-down menu.\nSelect the region of interest (in this case, the segmenting axon of interest). Click Next when finished.\nDefine the starting and seed points by assigning the largest and thinnest diameter measurements, which can be measured using the Slice mode.",
    "Assign a starting point at the edge of the region of interest. To achieve manual addition or removal of starting points, first change the pointer mode (Navigate | Select) and then Shift + right-click at the points of interest.\nSelect manual thresholds for seed points to ensure that all of the visible arborization is marked. Change the pointer mode (Navigate | Select) and then Shift + left-click at the points of interest to manually add or remove seed points.\n\tNOTE: It is important to manually remove background noises and signals from neighboring nerves.\nCheck the box Remove seed points around starting points.\nCheck Remove disconnected segments to allow exclusion of points that are too far away and that may represent background noise. Indicate the Maximum Gap Length in the next step to define the upper limit for exclusion.\nAdjust the threshold for background subtraction, which uses a Gaussian filter to estimate the background intensity of every voxel.\nSet automatic threshold for dendrite diameter using the Approximate cross-section area algorithm.\nSkip the steps for spine calculation.\nFinish the process and choose the desired style and color.\nUncheck the volume box in Properties to view only the reconstructed axons.\nUnder the Statistics tab, select Detailed. Use Filament No. Dendrite Terminal Points to quantify the motor nerve terminals as an indicator of motor axon arborization.\n\tNOTE: Statistical annotation can be added if desired.\nExport the image of the reconstructed axon as a .tif file.\nSubscription Required.
