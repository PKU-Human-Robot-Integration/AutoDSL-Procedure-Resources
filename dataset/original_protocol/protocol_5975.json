    "Fixing cellsPrepare fresh fixation buffer and keep on ice until needed. Label 1.5 ml tubes for each sample, including untreated and treated cells that will be stained with phalloidin, as well as matched control samples that will be processed identically but will not be stained with phalloidin (unstained controls).Prepare cells by concentrating to desired density by centrifugation and suspension in 100 μl per sample of fresh media or buffer; the minimum number of cells typically required for FACS analysis is 10,000 per sample (see Note 6). For stimulation of HL-60 cells, resuspend in serum-free RPMI supplemented with 2% BSA, and incubate for 1 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 to depolarize the cells. Stimulate cells by adding 10 ul of 200 nM fMLP, gently tapping tube to mix, and incubating at 37 °C for 3 min (treated sample), followed by immediate fixation (do not do this for the control, untreated samples).Immediately fix cells in 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes by adding 400 µl of cold fixation buffer to each sample. Mix the sample by gently pipetting up and down. Incubate on ice for 20 min (see Note 5).Staining cellsCentrifuge cells at 4 °C to form a pellet (see Note 6). Remove the supernatant and resuspend cells in 100 µl of permeabilization buffer (see Note 2), and mix gently by pipetting up and down. Incubate for 10 min at room temperature. Centrifuge to pellet cells at either room temperature or 4 °C.Remove supernatant and resuspend cells in 100 µl of staining solution (see Recipes and Note D). Gently resuspend cells by pipetting up and down. Cover samples with aluminum foil and incubate at room temperature for 20 min then transfer to 4 °C.",
    "The length of time that samples can be stored in phalloidin can vary depending on the cell type; test this empirically when working with a new cell type (see Note 5). When ready to analyze cells by flow cytometry, centrifuge to form a pellet and remove the phalloidin supernatant. Wash several times by gently resuspending cells with 500 µl of PBS supplemented with 0.1% TWEEN-20 (a mild detergent used to break up the cells and avoid clumping) and centrifuge at 4 °C to form a pellet. After the last wash, resuspend in at least 500 µl of pre-chilled PBS and store samples on ice. Filter samples before flow cytometry (see Note 7).Check stained samples via fluorescence microscopy to ensure target structures are stained and that the overall cell morphology has not been compromised (the cells should look approximately similar to how they looked when alive).To ensure there are enough cells for the experiment, take an aliquot of stained cells and enumerate using a hemocytometer. Flow CytometryThis is not intended to be a complete guide to flow cytometry, and we suggest that readers unfamiliar with this technology see: the Flow Cytometry Basics Guide[href=https://www.bio-rad-antibodies.com/static/2016/fc-guide/flow-cytometry-basics-guide.pdf] from Bio-Rad, FlowJo video tutorials such as Cytometry 101 (https://www.flowjo.com/learn/flowjo-university/flowjo/before-flowjo/2[href=https://www.flowjo.com/learn/flowjo-university/flowjo/before-flowjo/2]) or BD Biosciences Introduction to Flow Cytometry Web-Based Training (https://www.bdbiosciences.com/us/support/s/itf_launch[href=https://www.bdbiosciences.com/us/support/s/itf_launch]). For the HL-60 cell data presented here, we used a FACSCalibur analyzer (BD).Setting ParametersFor this analysis, we measure FSC-height, SSC-height, and FIT-C: height, log. We also recommend collecting either FSC-width, SSC-width, and/or FSC-area if the cytometer has those capabilities, as these values will allow for elimination of doublets (see Note 9). The differences in sample fluorescence are large, so we display the fluorescence intensities in log scale.  FACSDiva software displays a worksheet populating data into histograms, scatter plots, and provides population statistics based on gating.",
    "We recommend setting up a global worksheet to visualize data during the adjustments and acquisition.  Depending on your cytometer, adjust the laser intensity and/or the detector to 1) capture forward and side scatter (to eliminate dead cells, clumps, doublets, etc. see Note 9 for doublet elimination) and 2) make sure that your samples are fluorescing within the detectable range. Adjust these parameters as your control sample is running through the flow cytometer at a low speed. Typically, a scatterplot with forward scatter and side scatter will show the population in real time as cytometer collects data. The target population should be well separated from the axes to avoid exclusion of data. Using a selection tool, create an initial gate by setting points around the entire population and adjust the cytometer to center the fluorescence intensity of the entire cells in the population. Do this very carefully because you cannot later recover data outside of the range of the detector.Data acquisitionOnce the lasers and detector are properly adjusted, use the same laser intensities on all data collected for all samples in the replicate. The cytometer can (and should) be adjusted for each experimental replicate, but once set for your experiment, analyze all samples using the same cytometer settings (see Note 8). If you have an unstained sample, a low-level background fluorescence is normal as dead cells autofluoresce."
