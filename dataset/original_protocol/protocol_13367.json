    "All experiments discussed here were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Kentucky.\nNOTE: Surgical instruments are listed in Figure 1 and the Table of Materials. C57BL/6J mice, 8-10 weeks old, male/female or relevant genetically manipulated (Knockout or Knockin) strains were used.\n1. FeCl3-induced carotid artery injury\nMouse anesthesia induction\n\t\nWeigh the mouse.\nAnesthetize the mouse by injecting 0.2 g/kg tribromoethanol solution intraperitoneally (i.p.). Make sure that the anesthetic solution is at room temperature (RT) before injecting it. This dose is enough to sedate the mouse for about 1 h.\nCheck the toe reflex by pinching the toe 5 min after injection to make sure the mouse is sedated. If the mouse is not sedated, it will pull its toe away. If that happens, wait 5 min and check again.\nIf the mouse is still not completely sedated, administer 1/4 of the initial dose and wait for 5 min.\nThroughout the procedure, periodically monitor the anesthetic plane of the mouse via a toe-pinch. Additionally, respiration rate and body temperature could also be monitored to maintain optimum anesthesia.\nImmobilize the mouse\n\t\nLay the mouse on the heating pad (37 °C) in a supine position and use adhesive tape to immobilize the extremities.\nUse a surgical thread (0.1 mm) to gently pull the upper front teeth of the mouse to extend the cervical/neck region. This is important for better visualization of the surgical area and stability of the Doppler probe. The thread size is not important, as it is only used to pull the front teeth of the animal to extend the neck.\nIncision\n\t\nSpray the surgical area with 70% ethanol or wipe it with an alcohol wipe.",
    "Using a cotton swab, apply a small amount of hair-removal cream on the surgical area. Wait for 1-2 min and then use a wet paper towel or tissue to remove the cream.\n\t\tNOTE: This step is important for a clean surgical area.\nUsing scissors and forceps (Figure 1B11,1B13), make a midline incision from the mandible to the suprasternal notch. Retract the skin to obtain a better visualization of the area (Figure 2A).\nCarotid artery exposure\n\t\nUsing surgical forceps and micro dissecting forceps, blunt dissect the overlaying superficial fascia and remove it to expose the left carotid artery (Figure 1B12,1B13). Make sure not to use scissors at this stage to avoid injuring other vasculature in this area.\nRemove extra tissue surrounding the carotid artery. Avoid excessive dissection of the surrounding tissue, since this area harbors the vagus nerve and vertebral artery.\nSeparate the carotid artery from surrounding tissue by dissecting it with surgical and suture-tying forceps (Figure 1B12,1B15,2C). Make sure not to extend or pull the artery to avoid any mechanical injury to the artery or the surrounding vasculature.\nPlace a piece of plastic under the artery to mark the location of the injury (Figure 2D). Use a colored transparency sheet to make it easier to see in the surgical field.\nPlacement of the flow probe\n\t\nPlace the Doppler transonic flow probe in saline solution (0.9% NaCl in dH2O) for about 10 min before the surgery. Insert the other end of the probe into an attachment in the flowmeter to facilitate the reading of the flow. Attach the flowmeter to a computer.\n\t\tNOTE: In between surgeries, the Doppler transonic flow probe should be in saline. Make sure to keep the probe moist and clean throughout the procedure.",
    "Place the ultrasound Doppler transonic flow probe around the artery upstream of the plastic (Figure 2D). Make sure that the vessel holder region of the probe is not too extended (Figure 1C, red arrow).\n\t\tNOTE: If needed, support the probe with gauze pads (Figure 1B1) to achieve an appropriate height of the probe, facilitating the optimal reading position.\nIf the surgical area is dry by this point, add a few drops of RT saline to keep the area moist. Monitor the flow probe reading. The optimal reading varies for each animal and could be anywhere between 0.6-1.2 mL/min. If it is less or not stable, change the flow probe position to get an optimal reading.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure that the neck of the mouse is not too extended, and that the surgical area is clean.\nRecord the flow baseline\n\t\nAfter placing the probe, monitor the blood flow for 2 min to ensure that the flow is steady. Then, record the flow for 2 min (Figure 3B) as a baseline. For a detailed description of the flowmeter, refer to Subramaniam et al.17.\nTo record the blood flow, start the WinDAQ software. Click on the File option and then click on Record. Make a new folder and file, and start recording. To stop recording, click on Stop in the file section.\n\t\tNOTE: WinDAQ software is freely available from the publisher: https://www.dataq.com/products/windaq/.\nInjury\n\t\nStop the recording of the flow. Make sure not to alter the probe position so that the readings stay consistent after the injury.\nDry the area thoroughly with a wipe/paper towel.",
    "NOTE: Even a small volume of residual liquid may alter the concentration of FeCl3 solution used to inflict vascular injury. This leads to variable results and affects reproducibility. When the area is completely dry, the probe is not able to measure the flow.\nIn a plastic weighing boat, put a circular filter paper (1 mm diameter, cut with a 1 mm diameter ear punch). Add 1 µL of 6% FeCl3 solution (made in dH2O) onto the filter paper.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure to add FeCl3 solution just before using the filter paper. Soaking the paper too early may lead to the evaporation of FeCl3 solution and change the severity of the injury.\nUsing fine forceps, pick up the filter paper and put it on the artery upstream of the probe, on the part of the artery marked by the plastic (Figure 2D,E). This plastic acts as a marker and a spacer. It marks the injured area and prevents accidental dilution of the FeCl3 by avoiding contact with the surrounding moist area.\n\t\t​NOTE: Make sure that the filter paper is straight, not pinched or otherwise folded in any way. Once placed on the artery, do not change the position of the filter paper; doing so changes the extent of the injury.\nAfter placing the filter paper, start the timer and record the blood flow. After 3 min, remove the paper and add saline at the site of injury to remove the FeCl3 and stop the injury process. It also makes the area moist. At this stage, the blood flow should return to the baseline level, as recorded pre-injury.",
    "Monitor and record the flow till it reduces to 10% of the original recording or reaches zero. There is a steady decrease once the thrombus starts to form at the injury site (Figure 3C). Note any significant fluctuations in the flow during this time.\nTo study the stability of the thrombus, record the rapid increase in blood flow after each significant and consistent decrease. These events are classified as embolization due to unstable thrombosis (Figure 4D). After the consistent decrease in flow, the operator is able to see the injury on the artery at the termination of the experiment (Figure 2F, blue arrow/dotted oval).\nThe vessel occlusion time is defined as the complete cessation of blood flow for at least 1 min. Record the time at which an occlusive thrombus is formed, as shown by the zero reading or significant decrease in flow.\nTerminate the experiment at 30 min. If the thrombus does not form within 30 min of monitoring, then record the flow, stop the recording, and remove the probe.\nClean the probe with 70% ethanol and a brush to remove any residual tissue/hair or debris. Dry the probe completely before placing it in the storage box. Dry the probe completely before placing it in the storage box for long term storage.\nEuthanize the mouse by cervical dislocation. Place the carcass in the carcass disposal bag, labeled with the lab's name and the date.\n2. Collection and preparation of samples for serial block face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) studies post FeCl3-induced Injury",
    "NOTE: The EM protocol presented is appropriate for sample preparation for SBF-SEM. This imaging technique offers an unprecedented ability to study the three-dimensional structure of platelets in a clot. With this technique, the sample is visualized as a series of sequential block SEM images, generated as one progresses through the sample. Key points for this preparation are: 1) the sample must be stained with heavy metals pre-embedding; and 2) the plastic embedded sample must be trimmed appropriately for mounting within the SEM (see Figure 6 for a visual of trimmed samples). Post-embedding staining is not possible within the SEM. When collecting a sample from a FeCl3-induced vessel injury for EM analysis, the following changes need to be made while performing the surgery. The modifications in the FeCl3 surgery protocol presented are also applicable to any form of electron microscopy. Anesthesia conditions and the steps for making an incision and exposing the carotid artery are the same as in Protocol 1.\nAfter exposing the carotid artery, mark the site of injury by loosely encircling the region between two surgical threads (size: 0.1 mm) (Figure 5A,B).\nPlace the probe under the artery, distal from the lower thread (Figure 5C).\nInsert the plastic piece under the artery between the two threads to mark the site for FeCl3 injury (Figure 5C).\nTake flow measurements before performing injury to note the basal flow. These measurements are used to decide at which stage the sample will be collected.\n\tNOTE: Make sure the fixative (3% paraformaldehyde/PFA + 0.1% glutaraldehyde, both made in 1x PBS) is ready and at RT. Alternatively, fixation with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in a saline background could also be used.",
    "CAUTION: Both paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde are highly toxic and irritant. While handling them, gloves, an eye shield, and masks should be used to protect from exposure. All fixative solutions are toxic, and fixation steps should be carried out in a fume hood.\nPerform the injury by placing FeCl3-soaked filter paper on the artery (8% FeCl3 is used) for 3 min (this time could vary as well). After 3 min, remove the filter paper and add saline at the injury site to remove any excess residual FeCl3. This step is necessary to prevent the variable extent of the injury and to facilitate flow counting by the probe (Figure 5D).\nMonitor the flow reading. When the flow drops below 50% of the initial value, remove the probe. Quickly dry the area and add the fixative in the area to externally fix the injury area.\nPromptly hold the artery near the injury area with forceps, and cut downstream of the lower thread and upstream of the upper thread. If necessary, ask another person to help cut one end. Put the tissue on the plastic tissue culture dish in the same orientation as it was collected, and add a few drops of the fixative.\n\tNOTE: Cutting the artery causes immediate extensive bleeding, so make sure to hold the artery before cutting it the first time. In this scenario, the mouse is exsanguinated. The mouse is euthanized by exsanguination and cervical dislocation.\nUsing a scalpel, clean the extra tissue around the artery. Be mindful to record the orientation of the blood flow. To mark that, cut one end horizontally and the other tapering/oblique (Figure 5E).",
    "Keep the sample in fixative (3% PFA and 0.1% glutaraldehyde) for 1 h at RT. Then, store the sample in 1% PFA at 4 °C until sending it on wet ice to the sample processing lab for EM analysis.\n\tNOTE: The samples should not be frozen. The challenges for this method of sample collection are:\n\t\nThe initial reading may not be optimal or may fluctuate after the injury. This may affect the extent of injury that is chosen to arrest for EM analysis. To address this problem, make sure to record the baseline reading for a few minutes, after trying various positions of placing the probe to decide which position is optimal.\nThe time to arrest the injury by adding external fixative and actual cutting of the arterial section for analysis may add variability to the extent of thrombosis. Be quick during sample collection after fixing externally.\nReceive the samples for processing for EM analysis in 1% PFA on wet ice. Rinse the samples for 3 min, on ice, with 0.1 M cacodylate buffer to initiate further processing.\nFix the samples for 1 h on ice in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer + 2.5% glutaraldehyde + 2 mM CaCl2.\nDiscard the fixative and wash the samples with cold 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer containing 2 mM CaCl2 (5 x 3 min) (Figure 6A).\nFix the samples with osmium solution (3% potassium ferrocyanide [K4C6N6Fe] + 0.3 M cacodylate buffer + 4 mM CaCl2 mixed with an equal volume of 4% aqueous osmium tetroxide [OsO4; in ddH2O]) for 1 h on ice.\nWhile the samples are fixing, make fresh 1% trichloroacetaldehyde hydrate (TCH) solution in ddH2O. Incubate the solution at 60 °C for 1 h while gently mixing.\nAfter fixing, wash the samples with ddH2O at RT for 5 x 3 min.",
    "Incubate the samples in filtered 1% TCH solution (made in ddH2O) for 20 min at RT.\nWash the samples with ddH2O at RT (5 x 3 min).\nFix the samples in 2% osmium tetroxide in ddH2O for 30 min at RT.\nWash the samples with ddH2O at RT for 5 x 3 min each.\nPlace the samples in 1% uranyl acetate (aqueous) and incubate overnight at 4 °C.\nWash the samples with ddH2O at RT for 5 x 3 min each, and process them with en bloc Walton's lead aspartate staining.\nEn bloc Walton's lead aspartate staining3:\n\t\nMake 30 mM L-aspartic acid solution in ddH2O.\n\t\tNOTE: The aspartic acid dissolves more quickly if the pH is raised to 3.8. This stock solution is stable for 1-2 months if refrigerated.\nMake 20 mM lead nitrate solution in 10 mL of aspartic acid stock, and adjust the pH to 5.5 with 1 N KOH.\nPlace the samples in lead aspartate solution at 60 °C for 30 min, following five washes with ddH2O at RT, each for 3 min.\nDehydrate the specimens with a graded ethanol series. Use the chemical dehydration by Valdivia protocol18.\n\t\nWash the samples in each of the following solutions to progressively dehydrate the sample (Figure 6B):\n\t\t25% ethyl alcohol for 3 min\n\t\t50% ethyl alcohol for 3 min\n\t\t75% ethyl alcohol for 3 min\n\t\t95% ethyl alcohol for 3 min\n\t\t100% ethyl alcohol for 10 min, and repeat the step twice (total of three washes).\nWash the samples in 100% propylene oxide (PO) for 10 min, and repeat the step twice (total of three washes).\nIncubate in 50%/50% PO/resin with DMP 30 activator overnight at RT, and embed in 100% Araldite 502/embed 812/DDSA with DMP30 activator for 48 h.\nSubscription Required.
