    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nUltrasound stimulation and brain slice collection\nTiming: 3 days\nThis step outlines how to determine the effectiveness of ultrasound stimulation in the targeted region through brain slice staining. If the experiment is successful, significantly more neurons should be activated and fluorescently labeled in the ultrasound stimulation group compared to the control group in the region of interest.\nCritical: The procedure should be done in a quiet environment to prevent excessive auditory cortex activation.\nSetup the ultrasound system.\nMake a water tube. Prepare a 50 mL centrifuge tube, shorten the sharp side of the tube until the diameter of the aperture is 6 mm. Shorten the tube until it is 4 cm long (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/527-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. .Technical details of the ultrasound system\n(A) Diagram of the ultrasound transducer with a transducer cone as wave guide.\n(B) A schematic of ultrasound system installment.\n(C) An illustration of the ultrasound temporal profile used in our experiments with a typical intensity of 0.3 MPa. Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C reprinted with permission from Qiu et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3].\nSeal the aperture with plastic wrap (Sinya), then fix the plastic wrap with sealing film.\nFill the prepared tube with water that has been standing more than 12 h, to reduce the presence of air bubbles. Pour with care to minimize formation of new air bubbles.\nAffix the water tube to the 500 kHz transducer (I7-0012-P-SU, Olympus) slowly, prevent formation of air gap or bubbles between the transducer and water (one may fully fill the tube in step c to get this done more easily). Use tissue to dry any overflowing water.\nUse sealing film to fix the transducer to the water tube.\nScrew the integrated ultrasound transducer onto a stand.",
    "Connect the output of the function generator (AFG251, Tektronix) to the input of the power amplifier (A075, Electronics & Innovation Ltd) with a BNC wiring, then connect the output of the amplifier to the transducer (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nAnesthetize the mouse with ketamine and xylazine (100 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg respectively) via IP injection with a disposable syringe and place it back to its original cage.\nJudge the mouse’s level of consciousness by tail and foot pinch reflexes. After confirming that the mouse is deeply anesthetized, place ointment on the mouse’s eyes to prevent drying.\nShave the fur around the skull and sterilize the shaved regions with 70% alcohol.\nPad the mouse’s lower jaw with a few pieces of paper towel to ensure that the mouse’s head is in a flat position (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/527-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. .c-Fos staining in brain slices\n(A) Schematic illustration of our in vivo neuron sensitization and ultrasound stimulation plan.\n(B) A diagram of the tissue platform.\n(C) Representative images of the right DMS and the regions of cerebral cortex directly above it, expressing DAPI, EYFP and c-Fos. The scale bars in the b panel and b2 panel represent 500 μm and 250 μm, respectively. Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A reprinted with permission from Qiu et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3].\nUse 70% alcohol to sterilize the shaved region again.\nCentrifuge the ultrasound gel at 1000 g for 10 min before doing the experiment. Put some ultrasound gel on the surface of the shaved region. Make sure air bubbles are not present in the gel.\nPlace the ultrasound transducer on the surface of the ultrasound gel atop the targeted regions. The distance between the water tube and the surface of the mouse brain is around 2 mm. Try to position the middle of transducer on the injection site.",
    "Stimulate the mouse with ultrasound (500 kHz ultrasound, 400 μs pulse width, 1 ms pulse interval, 300 ms stimulation duration and 0.3 MPa) for 40 min with a 10 s inter stimulus interval (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nAfter stimulation, return the mouse to its original cage.\n90 min after ultrasound treatment, perfuse the mouse with PBS, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. A full perfusion protocol is described by Gage et al (Gage et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nKeep the isolated brain in 4% PFA about 12–16 h at 4°C. After that, wash the brain with 1×PBS 3 times, 15 min each time.\nVibratome slice the brain, obtaining individual sections that are spaced 40 μm apart.\nNote: Fill the vibratome with PBS and attach perfused brain to the pad with superglue. After each slice, extract the slice and place it in an individual well filled with PBS to maintain its structural integrity.\nNote: Coronal sections were prepared from brain regions spanning +0.1 mm to −0.8 mm of Bregma in mouse brains for cortical sections and spanning +0.20 mm to 1.0 mm of Bregma for DMS sections.\nc-Fos staining.\nIn order to prevent nonspecific antibody binding, slices are blocked in the blocking buffer (10% normal goat serum + 5% BSA + 0.3% Triton in 1×PBS) for 2 h at 22°C–24°C.\nThe primary antibody (1: 500; Cell Signaling Technology, 2250) is diluted with blocking buffer. Slices are incubated with primary antibody for 16–20 h at 4°C.\nWash the slices with 1× PBS 3 times, 5 min each time.\nIncubate with secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), Alexa Fluor 555 (A-21428, Invitrogen, dilution 1:1,000) diluted in blocking buffer for 2 h at 22°C–24°C.\nWash slices for 5 min 3 times.",
    "Remove the brain slice from storage and place on the glass slide with a brush or other thin utensil. Multiple slices can be arranged on a single slide.\nLet the slide dry for 5 min. Administer small drops of Prolong Diamond Antifade Mountant with DAPI, then place cover slide on top of the glass slide.\nImage the brain slices (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) and count c-Fos signals.\nNote: All brain slices were imaged using a confocal microscope (TCS SP8, Leica) in the University Research Facility in Life Sciences (ULS) facilities in The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The number of cells showing c-Fos signals (red) and DAPI (blue) were counted using ImageJ, and the number of c-Fos+ cells per 733 × 733 μm slice were calculated. The counting of c-Fos+ cells was single-blinded, performed by an experimenter who did not know the experimental groups beforehand.\nElectromyogram (EMG) recording\nTiming: 3 h\nThe purpose of this step is to test whether ultrasound stimulation can induce motoric responses. If the region of interest is in a motor-related area, spikes in EMG signals should be observed simultaneously with ultrasound stimulation at a higher amplitude than control. If the region is not motor-related, ultrasound stimulation should have no correlation with EMG signal spikes.\nThe EMG system used consists of two recording electrodes, 1 ground wire and a multi-channel signal acquisition system (Medusa, Bio-Signal Technologies). The surgical instruments and reagents necessary are an isoflurane system, a heating pad, tissue, scissors, scalpel, cotton tip, 70% alcohol and saline.\nNote: The mice models used in our protocol were either injected with CaMKII-EYFP or CamKII-MscL-G22S viruses in their M1 regions 4 weeks prior. See “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]” for the viral injection procedure.",
    "Setup the EMG and ultrasound system. Connect the ultrasound system to the EMG system in order to synchronize the ultrasonic signals to the EMG recording software.\nHold the mice in the procedure room for 30 min before beginning the experiment.\nAnesthetize the mouse with 2% isoflurane for 5 min in the isoflurane box.\nPut the mouse flat on the operation table. Spread all four limbs so that they are easily accessible. Connect the tube that outputs isoflurane and oxygen to the mouse’s nose. Keep the concentration of isoflurane as above. Add a 37°C heating pad under the mouse’s body during the whole experiment if necessary.\nNote: Consistently check on the mouse’s condition by observing its heartbeat. If its vitals are weak, decrease the isoflurane concentration.\nPlace ointment on the mouse’s eyes to prevent drying.\nShave the fur on the mouse’s head and around the left forelimb near the triceps muscle with a scissor or razor carefully.\nDisinfect the surgical region with 70% alcohol, moving outwards from the middle of the surgical site.\nTake the scalpel and blunt forceps. Use the blunt forceps to gently hold the exposed skin on the left forelimb and make an incision with the scalpel. The incision should be vertical and about 0.5 cm in length to expose the triceps. Separate two sides of skin with cotton tip slightly to expose the triceps. Clean the blood with a cotton tip.\nInsert two recording electrodes into the triceps 2 mm deep and leave 2–3 mm between the electrodes. Fix the electrodes with a sticker. Connect a ground electrode to the tail.\nApply some ultrasound gel on the top of the mouse’s head. Make sure no air bubbles are present in the gel.",
    "Place the integrated ultrasound transducer mentioned above on the mouse’s head, with the middle of transducer on the injection site.\nSetup the ultrasound system with the following parameters: 500 kHz frequency, 400 μs pulse width, 1 ms pulse interval, 300 ms stimulation duration, 5 s interval. The independent variable is peak positive pressure 0.05–0.5 MPa.\nAfter setup, reduce the concentration of isoflurane to 0.5%–0.8%.\nAllow the mice to rest for 5 min to adapt to the new level of isoflurane.\nOpen the EMG software. Press the input button and check that the EMG signal is present.\nPress the record button and name the file. Record 1 min of the EMG signal without ultrasound stimulation.\nAdjust the amplitude of ultrasound to 0.05 MPa. Press the start button in the ultrasound machine. Treat the mouse with 0.05 MPa ultrasound stimulation for 7–10 times.\nPress the stop button after ultrasound stimulation.\nRest for around 60 s.\nRepeat steps 33–34 for the other acoustic pressure.\nPress the stop button in the EMG recording software after all acoustic pressure are tested.\nAdjust the concentration of isoflurane to 2% for 2 min to reduce pain during electrode withdrawal. Remove the recording electrodes from the triceps with tweezers and remove the ground wire from the mouse’s tail.\nUse an alcohol-soaked cotton tip to disinfect the triceps. Prepare the sterile suture and needle and clamp the needle with a needle holder. Gently push the suture into the skin and use blunt forceps to grasp the skin on the other side of the incision. Pull the suture material out until approximately 0.75 inches remain and make a knot.\nRepeat the suture step (step 38) 3–-5 times or until the incision is fully closed. Use an interrupted knot.",
    "Continue to warm the mouse with the heater until the mouse wakes up. Place the mouse into the original cage."
