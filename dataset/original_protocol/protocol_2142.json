Let the cells grow for 2–3 h until OD600 reaches to 0.6.\nAdd IPTG to a final concentration of 0.2 mM and further incubate the cell culture at 16°C for 18 h.\nHarvest the cells by centrifugation at 3,500 g and 4°C for 20 min.\nMix harvested cells with adding 15 mL Buffer A50 (pH 7.4).\nDisrupt the resuspended cells by sonication (VCX 500, Sonics & Materials) using 150 cycles of 2 s ON and 4 s OFF at 40% amplitude (500 Watts and 20 kHz frequency) to assure complete cell lysis.\nCentrifuge the lysates at 13,000 g and 4°C for 30 min.\nCollect the supernatant and filter it through 0.45-μm syringe filter (ADVANTEC) to remove remaining cell debris and inclusion bodies.\nNote: This step is essential to increase protein purity.\nEquilibrate the filtered soluble fractions (∼15 mL) with Ni-NTA agarose resin (4 mL) with end-to-end rotation (40 rpm).",
    "The nickel affinity agarose resin is priorly equilibrated with Buffer A50 (pH 7.4).\nWash the column with Buffer A50 (pH 7.4) of 10 column volumes.\nPass the two column volumes of Buffer A70, Buffer A350, and Buffer A500 (pH 7.4) through nickel column, sequentially.\nExchange the protein-containing buffer with PBS (pH 7.4) using a Amicon Ultra-15 30K filter (Millipore) centrifugal filter.\nSelect a molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) close to one-third the molecular weight of the target protein size.\nRemove the his-tag by cleaving the TEV protease recognition site with the treatment of TEV protease.

    "Add 20 μL purified enzyme (0.05 mg/mL) and incubate at 25°C for 3 min without stirring.\nAdd 20 μL of 2 M glucose to initiate glucose oxidation, or 20 μL of deionized water to perform blank at OD600.\nAfter 1 min, stop the reaction by adding 100 μL of 6 M Urea and measure adsorption at OD600.\nCalculate enzyme activity based on the Beer-Lambert Law (Swinehart, 1962[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nNote: Enzyme activity (U) = (Aglucose – Ablank) / [ε × path length (cm) × incubation time (min)], where A is adsorption at OD600 and ε is molar absorption coefficient of DCIP (16.3 mM/cm at pH 7.0) (Inose et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nNote: In the case of GDHγα, approximately 12 U/mg of specific activity was obtained.\nAtomic force microscopy (AFM)\nTiming: 4 h\nThis section describes the binding morphology of surface-immobilized gold binding peptide-fused enzyme could be examined via observing biofilm morphology on a gold substrate.\nTo remove the dust or organic contaminants on gold coated silicon wafer (e.g., 5 mm × 5 mm), prepare 100 mL of 1:3 (v/v) of 30% H2O2/H2SO4 (piranha solution) in 500 mL beaker.\nIncubate the gold substrate in piranha solution for 10 min, at 25°C.\nRinse the gold substrate with deionized water and dry it with pressurized nitrogen gas.\nAdd 500 μL of 0.1 μM target enzyme dissolved in PBS (pH 7.4) into 1.5 mL microtube.\nInsert the surface-cleaned gold substrate in the enzyme solution containing microtube.\nIncubate the gold substrate in the enzyme solution-containing microtube, on a rotary shaker of 200 rpm, for 2 h (25°C).\nRemove weakly bound proteins on the gold surface by sonication (30 Hz) in enzyme-free PBS for 30 s.\nTo remove salts on the surface, wash off the surface with stream of deionized water for 30 s.",

By analyzing the onset potential, the presence of a direct electron transfer signal is identified, and the peak current in the cyclic voltammogram can provide evidence of interfacial direct electron transfer efficiency (Lee et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nNote: In the case of FAD-dependent enzyme, it is known that -0.46 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) is ideal onset potential.\nPrepare screen-printed gold electrode (SPGE) (DropSens) that consists of Au working electrode (4 mm in diameter), Pt auxiliary electrode, and Ag pseudo-reference electrode (Lee et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nNote: Before enzyme immobilization, the SPGE should be verified not to have interfering electrochemical signal by conducting CV with bare SPGE.\nAdd 800 μL of 0.5 μM target enzyme dissolved in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) into a disposable cuvette.",
    "Immerse the SPGE into the enzyme solution containing cuvette and incubate it on the rotary shaker of 200 rpm, for 2 h at 25°C.\nWash off the excess proteins on the gold working electrode surfaces with a stream of PBS, for 30 s.\nConnect the enzyme-modified SPGE to potentiostat (Autolab, Metrohm) via a connector.\nImmerse the enzyme-modified SPGE in the reactor (working volume: 10 mL) with 8 mL of 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4).\nNote: To detect glucose-led oxidative current, add 2 M glucose stock dissolved in 10 mM potassium-based phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for glucose content to be 0–100 mM.\nSet the scan rate to be 100 mV/s and perform the CV in the potential range of -500 mV–400 mV, using Nova 1.11 program.\nNote: The number of cycles was determined until the signal is stabilized. In this case, the signal was shown to be stabilized after individual 20–30 cycles. Also, when the scan direction is changed to reverse (compared with original direction), we did not observe large difference."
