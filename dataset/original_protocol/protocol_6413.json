    "This protocol describes how to set up mixed co-swarming assays between two different strains of Proteus mirabilis and how to recover cells of each strain from the mixed swarm using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The cells were recovered to measure changes in growth rate caused by phenotypic changes induced by the Ids signaling system during swarm consolidation. We use two P. mirabilis strains, KAG107 and KAG966, which have red and green fluorescent markers respectively. The protocol can be adapted to recover cells at other swarm phases or for other downstream applications. An example of how this protocol can be used to generate cells for RNA-Seq library preparation is described at the end of this procedure.  Setup of apparatus, particularly the FACSAria cell sorter and Tecan plate reader, should be done in advance prior to preparation of experimental samples.Inoculation and growth of bacterial culturesDay 1 Streak out stab cultures of strains of interest onto LSW- non-swarm agar plates using an inoculation loop and sterile technique. Incubate at 37 °C overnight.Pick a single colony with a sterile pipette tip and use to inoculate 5 ml LB media in a glass culture tube using sterile technique. Incubate at 37 °C overnight with shaking.Set up CM55 swarm agar plates for the next day by melting premade agar in a microwave and pouring 25 ml aliquots into sterile Petri dishes. Leave to cure under a Bunsen burner or in a laminar-flow cabinet with lids partially covering the plates for 2 h. Plates can be kept at room temperature after curing for 24 h. Consistency in pouring and curing is important for the reproducibility of swarm behavior. Changing the amount of agar per plate, or curing time, can result in unpredictable swarm behavior after inoculation with P. mirabilis.",
    "Day 2 Measure OD600 of overnight cultures using a spectrophotometer (typically, overnight cultures will reach OD600 3.0-3.5), then make 1 ml of OD600 1.0 normalized culture by diluting the relevant volume of overnight culture with fresh LB media in a sterile 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. Cultures can optionally be normalized to OD600 0.1 rather than OD600 1.0; this serves to extend the swarming time in Step A5 by around six hours without affecting the experimental outcome. Altering the OD in this way can be useful when organizing experimental timings.For experiments using more than one strain (e.g., co-swarming assays), add portions of the normalized cultures (to a total volume of ~200 µl) at the desired proportions to a fresh Eppendorf tube. Vortex to mix.Inoculate CM55 swarm agar plates by pipetting 1 µl of mixed normalized cell culture onto the center of the plate. Incubate at 37 °C until completion of the first swarm ring, including consolidation, and emergence of the second swarm ring (around 8 h). It is important to begin the next step in the protocol at this time period to remove experimental errors caused by lack of swarm culture synchronization. To this end, plates should be checked by eye every 30 min after the emergence of the first swarm ring. Plates are most likely ready for harvesting as soon as the second swarm ring has begun to emerge from the consolidation area corresponding to the completed first swarm ring. Example images can be seen in Figure 1. Plates are ready once they have reached a state similar to Figure 1B.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200302/20200302170425_4005.jpgFigure 1.

Arrows show position of outer edge of swarm ring.Confirm emergence of the second swarm ring using light microscopy. Elongated swarmer cells should form visible rafts emerging from a densely-packed consolidation area, around 1 cm from the center of the plate. 10x or 40x magnification of a phase contrast, epifluorescence, brightfield or DIC image is sufficient to distinguish rafts of motile, elongated swarming cells from shorter, stationary consolidating cells by direct imaging of a plate. Figure 2 shows example phase contrast and Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) epifluorescence images of swarming cells and consolidating cells.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200302/20200302170546_5274.jpgFigure 2.

Fluorescent cells were added to a non-fluorescent population at a ratio of 1:10 to allow individual cells to be seen. Scale bar = 40 µm.Preparing cells for FACSRemove and dispose of the inoculum from the rest of the experimental sample by punching through the agar with a disposable pipette tip. It is necessary to discard this subset of cells as it does not take part in self recognition behavior. A demonstration can be seen in Video 1.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Removing inoculum from swarm plates using a pipette tip Wash the remaining cells off the agar plate by pipetting 1-1.5 ml sterile PBS onto the plate and gently lifting cells off the surface with an inoculation plate spreader. Once all cells have been harvested, tilt the plate slightly to pool the PBS/cell mix at one side, then pipette into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube chilled on ice.",
    "Dilute the cell suspension using ice-cold PBS in a 50 ml conical tube until mixture is barely turbid (approximately OD600 0.05) and decant 2 ml into a chilled FACS collection tube.FACSAria setupHere we describe the settings for sorting fluorescently labeled bacteria on a BD FACSAria. We assume familiarity with operation of a FACSAria and precalibration of the C&ST, droplet delay, side stream angle and breakoff. Users should receive training in operating the FACSAria prior to performing this assay. We recommend setting up a practice run to determine sorting settings prior to generating experimental samples for downstream analysis.Turn on FACSAria and controlling PC 30 min prior to experimental start. Load FACSDiva software.Install the high pressure 70 PSI nozzle.Set Sample Temperature in the FACSDiva Cytometer menu to 4 °C. If the sort collection chamber can be temperature controlled, set that to 4 °C also.Insert labeled FACS collection tubes into the sort collection chamber.Install the sample into the FACSAria sample injection chamber and load.Arrange the FACSDiva workspace so that forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) can be charted against one another.Set up sorting gates to retain particles with forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) of approximately 1,000-50,000 (Figure 3). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200302/20200302170648_7219.jpgFigure 3. Chart of side-scatter (SSC) vs forward-scatter (FSC) of P. mirabilis particles run through a FACSAria. The area labeled P2 represents a sorting gate that has been set up to isolate single particles from doublets.Set up a second chart measuring red fluorescence intensity against green intensity: each color corresponds to a strain of interest. Set up sorting gates to isolate particles with fluorescence intensity of approximately 103 or higher (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200302/20200302170725_8658.jpgFigure 4. Chart of Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) intensity (PE-Texas Red-A, Y-axis) versus GFP intensity (FITC-A, X-axis) for single P. mirabilis sorted particles (the P2 subset from Figure 2).",
    "RFP+ and GFP+ gates are set up to isolate red and green particles respectively.In the Sort Layout window, select the relevant gates for the collection tubes, set Precision to “Purity” and Particle Count to 1,000,000.Press “Sort” in the Sort Layout window to begin sorting into the collection tubes. Check periodically that the tubes do not overfill. If they do, pause the sort from the Sort Layout window, turn off the deflection plates from the Acquisition Dashboard, swap out the collection tubes, and restart the sort from the Sort Layout window.Once the sorted particle count has been reached, unload the sample. To clean the FACSAria, load and run a tube containing 20% bleach solution through the cell sorter for 10 min, then load and run a tube containing Milli-Q water for 10 min.Note: Samples for RNA-Seq library preparations can be isolated through FACS. If this is done, cells should be harvested from swarm plates with 1x PBS and sorted into a microcentrifuge tube containing 500 µl RNA-Protect solution. We recommend limiting sorting time for individual samples to 10 min to avoid transcriptomic shifts caused by harvesting and sorting. Multiple FACS runs can be combined into a single sample. RNA can then be isolated for downstream applications via standard kits such as the Qiagen RNEasy Mini.Measuring growth recovery following swarmingRecord the number of sorted particles for each condition. Typically, 100,000 to 1,000,000 particles will be sorted. One strain will have a higher sorted particle count than the other. Normalize cell mixtures to a standardized concentration (typically 100,000 cells/ml) by adding defined volumes of sorted cell mixture to a defined volume of sterile PBS. Keep normalized cell mixtures on ice.Immediately after sorting and normalization, set up growth recovery assays on flat-bottomed 96-well plates.",
    "For the Tecan plate reader described here, plates need not be covered or sealed. For each sorted cell mixture, add 50 µl sorted cell mixture to a well containing 250 µl LB broth. If sufficient volume of cell mixture is available, set up technical duplicates in adjacent wells. Run negative control wells containing 300 µl LB broth. Carefully note which mixtures are in which well.Turn on Tecan plate reader and the controlling PC. Insert the 96-well plate with samples into the plate reader. Ensure that the 595 nm absorbance filterset is in the filter slot.Measure OD595 of wells using the Tecan plate reader. Open the Tecan iControl software and run the following program:Temperature 37 °CPlate: Costar 96 Flat TransparentPart of Plate: Select the wells containing experimental samplesKinetic cycle: duration 23 h:50 min:0 sAbsorbance measurement 595 nm, 25 flashesShaking 900 s, amplitude 1 mm, linear modeShaking 898 s, amplitude 1 mm, linear modeWait (Timer) 2 sThis will take an OD595 measurement every 30 min for 24 h.The Tecan iControl software will automatically export to an open Excel spreadsheet. Save the resulting files for further analysis."
