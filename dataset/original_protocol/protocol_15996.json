    "The protocol presented here is illustrated in Figure 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-fig-0005]. The first section details the preparation of YCFA media adapted from Duncan et al. (2002[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0015]), including the base medium and media supplemented with the desired growth factors to be compared. The second and third sections describe preparation of 90-mm Petri dishes (which will be used for plating to single isolates and for whole-plate streaking for growth rate experiments) and 48-well plates containing with two different media (for comparison in growth rate experiments). An example plate layout is provided for trial of a possible bacterial growth factor (in our case, mannitol in YCFA-M) against a standard of growth rate on YCFA medium with gut fluid (YCFA-GF). Both the 90-mm and 48-well plates are prepared in aerobic conditions, then depleted of any dissolved oxygen by storage in sealed anaerobic jars gassed with 47.5%, 47.5%, 5% (v/v/v) N2/CO2/H2 at 5 psi pressure and stored at 3-5°C. To ensure that new plates are completely depleted of oxygen, they should be stored in the anaerobic jar for at least 2 days.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/673931c4-564a-4d79-ba26-3e2c56f58da6/cpz1463-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nGeneration of solid anaerobic media for culture of obligately anaerobic gut bacteria. The initial reagents (Part 1) are added to the Hungate flask, gassed with N2 using the Hungate apparatus, and then autoclaved. Additional reagents (Part 2) are then added under a 47.5%, 47.5%, 5% (v/v/v) N2/CO2/H2 atmosphere to generate the base YCFA medium. Different media are generated by adding appropriate growth factors (e.g., mannitol, gut fluid) under the same gas atmosphere. Finally, 90-mm Petri dishes and 48-well plates are generated for use in growth rate measurement experiments.",
    "Throughout these protocols, strict adherence to Hungate technique is required to maintain anaerobic conditions. The Hungate gassing apparatus, developed by Hungate (1969[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0023]) and described by Bryant (1972[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0009]), enables aseptic and anaerobic transfer of ingredients between containers outside of an anaerobic hood. This allows generation and manipulation of sterile anaerobic bacterial culture media without the restrictions associated with the use of an anaerobic hood. Details for setting up and using the Hungate apparatus are outlined in Bryant (1972[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0009]). Three pure gas cylinders, separately containing N2, CO2, and H2, are attached to the Hungate apparatus prior to a copper column as outlined in Bryant (1972[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0009]). The ratio of gasses provided through the apparatus to the gassing needles can be adjusted using the dials on the cylinders, which adjust the pounds per square inch (psi) released from each cylinder. The volume delivery of each gas to the gassing apparatus can further be checked using flow meters, which are used to measure the standard cubic centimeter per meter (sccm) for each gas. This allows a precise gas atmosphere of 47.5%, 47.5%, 5% (v/v/v) N2/CO2/H2 to be maintained.\nMaterials\nSterile water (deionized or autoclaved)\nBacto tryptone (BD, cat. no. 211705)\nYeast extract (BBL, BD, cat. no. 211929)\nAgar (Difco, BD, cat. no. 21430)\n0.6% (w/v) K2HPO4 in distilled water (store 100 ml stock in a Schott bottle for up to 30 days at 3-5°C)\nMineral mix (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-rec-0003])\nTrace elements (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-rec-0005])\n0.1% (w/v) resazurin in distilled water (store 100 ml stock in a foil-covered Schott bottle for up to 30 days at room temperature)\n4% (w/v) NaHCO3 (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-rec-0004])\n2.5% (w/v) cysteine-HCl (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-rec-0001])\nVitamin K3 + hemin mix (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-rec-0006])\nVolatile fatty acids mix (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-rec-0007])\nGut fluid supernatant (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-rec-0002])",

The Hungate flask should be constantly swirled while held with the base one inch away from the top of the Bunsen burner flame.\n3. Remove the gassing needle and stopper the flask using the Hungate technique.",
    "4. Secure the stopper in place with using two pieces of aluminum wire twisted around the stopper and the neck of the Hungate flask (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-fig-0005]).\n5. Autoclave for 15 min at 121°C.\n6. Immediately secure the 100 ml Hungate flask in a 60°C water bath and remove the aluminum wire.\nIt is important to perform this step immediately after removing the flask from the autoclave, before the medium can cool and the agar solidify.\n7. Adjust the gas canisters of the Hungate apparatus to deliver a 47.5%, 47.5%, 5% (v/v/v) N2/CO2/H2 gas atmosphere.\n8. Insert the needle of the Hungate gassing apparatus, hold needle in place with a butyl rubber stopper, perform this procedure using the Hungate technique.\n9. Using the Hungate apparatus, add the following ingredients anaerobically under the N2/CO2/H2 atmosphere (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-fig-0005], Part 2):\n         \n10,000 μl 4% (w/v) NaHCO3\n2000 μl 2.5% (w/v) cysteine-HCl\n1000 μl vitamin K3 + hemin mix\n1000 μl volatile fatty acids mix\nAfter each new ingredient addition, return the bung into place alongside the needle, maintaining anaerobic conditions.\n10.

Pour 16 ml YCFA-GF into each 90-mm dish inside a sterile hood and leave in the hood for 30 min to cool and solidify.\nPlates are poured in aerobic conditions. Any dissolved oxygen will be removed from the medium in the next step.",
    "12. Store anaerobically for at least 2 days (up to 90 days) at 3-5°C in sealed anaerobic jars gassed with 47.5%, 47.5%, 5% (v/v/v) N2/CO2/H2 gas at 5 psi.\nJars are gassed using the Hungate apparatus with a tube attachment that can be inserted into the jar (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-fig-0003]). The copper tube can be inserted into one of the clampable rubber tubes attached to the jar. Each jar should contain one autoclave tape–sealed Petri dish full of Stak-Pak Catalyst and another full of activated charcoal to help maintain anaerobic conditions inside the jar. These dishes should be placed at the bottom of the Petri dish stack inside the jar. Catalyst and charcoal should be freshly activated by heating at 150°C for 1 hr.\nPour 48-well plates\n13. Design the layout of media to be poured in 48-well plates (for an example, see Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-fig-0006]).\nGrowth rate experiments require three replicates of each condition at each timepoint, with a no isolate control. A minimum of four timepoints during the growth phase are required to calculate the bacterial growth rate (Hall et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0020]). A 0-hr timepoint may also be useful to check that the inoculum concentration is consistent across wells. There may also be an optional stationary phase timepoint, taken after an isolate has reached maximum growth. This informs the study of optimal culture conditions, as it suggests when growth stopped and the stationary phase began.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ca94e427-432c-4ebc-aad0-8660aa736cb9/cpz1463-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6",

Six timepoints (rows A-F) can be tested on two trial media (YCFA-GF and YCFA-M). Timepoints include one at 0 hr, four during the growth period for isolates BP5G and BP52G, and one at stationary phase. Cells reconstituted at McFarland Standard 4 are added to columns 1-3 and 5-7 to give three replicates of each condition at each timepoint. Columns 4 and 8 are used for no isolate controls, which should show no growth and thus rule out contamination.\n14. Prepare the required number of 48-well plates in a sterile hood.\nPlates are poured in aerobic conditions. Any dissolved oxygen will be removed from the medium after it has solidified.\n15. Transfer the prepared YCFA medium variants (contained in Hungate flasks) from the 60°C water bath to the hood.\n16. Use sterile 10-ml serological pipettes to transfer 500 μl prepared medium to each well of the plates inside the hood.\nThis step must be performed quickly, as the medium will begin to solidify as soon as it is removed from the 60°C water bath.\nThe use of a serological pipette allows a large amount of medium to be taken up at once in a sterile fashion, then quickly pipetted into many wells. A multichannel pipette or a 1000-μl pipette may be used instead, as long as the media can be dispensed quickly and in sterile conditions.\n17. Leave poured plates in the hood for 30 min to cool and solidify.\n18. Store anaerobically for at least 2 days as described in step 12.",
    "For our experiments, bacteria were isolated from the hindgut of the silver drummer K. sydneyanus. Specimens were collected off the northeastern coast of New Zealand, where K. sydneyanus is a common herbivorous fish (Mountfort et al., 2002[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0036]). The gut was removed by dissection and allocated into five sections (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-fig-0004]) following the guidelines of Johnson and Clements (2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0026]). Microbial collection can take place from segments III, IV, and V, where microbial activity is highest. This was shown by Clements, Gleeson, & Slaytor (1994[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0013]), where three herbivorous fish were found to have significantly higher concentrations of short-chain fatty acids in segments III-V compared to the earlier segments I and II. Increased short-chain fatty acid concentration is a sign of bacterial fermentation (Clements et al., 1994[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0013]). Using this protocol, we sampled from gut sections IV and V and used novel bacterial species isolated from section IV for identification (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-prot-0003]) and growth rate experiments (Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-prot-0004]).

    "1. At the fish collection site, dissect gut from fish and divide into five sections (I-V) as in Figure 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-fig-0004].\n2. Remove gut contents from sections IV and V by squeezing into separate Hungate tubes. Stopper tubes under anaerobic conditions and transport to the laboratory.\nA transportable version of the Hungate apparatus can be used on the boat at the collection site. The Hungate gassing apparatus is connected to a small cylinder containing 90% N2 and 10% CO2 to purge the Hungate tubes of oxygen before sealing with a sterile butyl rubber stopper.\nContents of gut sections IV and V are stored separately to provide precise in vivo location information for a bacterial isolate of interest.\n3. Once in the laboratory, place tubes inside an anaerobic chamber and allow solids to settle (5 min standing time) before moving to the next steps.\nAs the gut contents are collected anaerobically, they can be streaked straight away after the solids have settled.\nThe anaerobic chamber is maintained at an atmosphere of 87.5%, 7.5%, 5% (v/v/v) N2/H2/CO2 using gas cylinders. Hydrogen levels are significantly reduced in the anaerobic chamber compared to the jars. This is to reduce risk to user, as hydrogen gas is highly flammable. The absence of oxygen inside the anaerobic chamber is confirmed throughout the process using a CAM-12 anaerobic monitor. Stak-Pak Catalyst and Desiccant should be present inside the anaerobic chamber. These packs are made from wire mesh to allow air to be circulated through the material.\nEverything is done at room temperature to this point. If needed, gut contents can be stored at 19-20°C until streaking.\nCulture to single isolates\n4. Use a sterile disposable inoculating loop to streak 100 μl crude gut content onto a 90-mm YCFA-GF plate inside the anaerobic chamber.",
    "Disposable loops are recommended because it is difficult and tedious to sterilize loops in the anaerobic hood using an incandescent flaming device.\nThis is culture one of the isolate of interest.\n5. Bring an anaerobic jar into the anaerobic chamber, place streaked plates inside the jar, and seal.\nEach anaerobic jar should contain one autoclave tape–sealed Petri dish full of Stak-Pak Catalyst and another one full of activated charcoal to help maintain anaerobic conditions inside the jar. These dishes should be placed at the bottom of the Petri dish stack inside each jar. Catalyst and charcoal should be freshly activated by heating at 150°C for 1 hr.\nSee step 3 for conditions of the anaerobic chamber.\n6. Remove anaerobic jar from the chamber and gas with mix of 47.5%, 47.5%, 5% (v/v/v) N2/CO2/H2 at 5 psi pressure using the Hungate gassing apparatus.\n7. Place sealed anaerobic jar inside a 20°C incubator for 3 days or until single colonies are visible.\nBacterial incubation should be maintained at the ambient seawater temperature of 17-23°C, because the gut environment of K. sydneyanus is also within this temperature range (Mountfort et al., 2002[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0036]).\n8. Pick well-isolated colonies and re-streak on YCFA-GF once they grow to a maximum cell number (∼3 days).\nThis is subculture one of the isolate of interest.\n9. Re-streak two more subcultures of each colony of interest to produce pure single isolate cultures. Label cultures after each streak to ensure consistency in colony picking.\nAfter the third streak, single colonies are ready for identification by colony PCR followed by Sanger sequencing using 16S V3-V4 primers (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-prot-0003]).",

    "If the isolate is a known species, there will be a 16S rRNA genetic sequence match in the database. In this case, further experimental work will add to the current knowledge of this species. If the isolate is a novel genus or species, its relatedness to known species can be found using BLAST and Geneious analysis. Currently, the cutoff for a novel species and genus is a sequence identity of 98.7% and 94.5%, respectively (Yarza et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0053]). Further experimental work on novel isolates will provide new information on previously uncultured species.\n12. Perform computational analysis of 16S sequencing data by using Geneious bioinformatics software to generate phylogenetic trees.\nPhylogenetic trees should include 16S sequences from the NBCI database, along with any unpublished sequences that have been identified previously using these methods. Generation of a phylogenetic tree informs future work on the isolate. If close relatives are found within the database, then previously published studies will inform the choice of medium for culturing these bacteria. Phylogenetic trees generated from many bacteria isolated from the same environment will give insight to the microbiome of the environment.",
    "This is a high-throughput protocol measuring the growth rates of fastidious anaerobic gut bacteria on different solid media. Growth effects of various nutrient additions can be compared to develop an optimal medium. In this protocol, YCFA (Duncan et al., 2002[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0015]) with gut fluid (YCFA-GF) is used as a standard against which novel media are compared. YCFA-GF often produces optimal growth rates of bacteria in vitro, as gut fluid replicates the natural nutrient environment of gut bacteria in vivo. However, as the nutrient content of fish gut fluid is variable (Egerton et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0016]), it is an unreplicable medium. This protocol allows a replicable medium with commercially sourced ingredients to be developed for any gut bacteria of interest. Importantly, strict anaerobic conditions are maintained at all times. Fish hindgut bacteria, cultured to single isolates and genetically identified using Basic Protocols 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-prot-0002] and 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-prot-0003], are tested for growth rate on two solid media: YCFA-GF and YCFA containing mannitol (YCFA-M). Mannitol was chosen as an ingredient of interest for reasons explained in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-prot-0001].",
    "In this protocol, determination of bacterial growth rate on solid media is based on methods developed for anaerobic bacterial culture by Casciato et al. (1975[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0010]). This group used water containing 0.1% gelatin (water-gel) to wash bacteria from the surface of solid medium in a Petri dish. Approximate cell density in the water-gel suspension was measured by converting the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) to approximate colony forming units per ml (CFU/ml) with the widely used McFarland standards (Casciato et al., 1975[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0010]; McFarland, 1907[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0032]). Using a single McFarland standard for all inocula within an experiment is important to maintain consistency and produce directly comparable results between isolates and conditions. Here, we have adjusted the inoculum to a cell density of McFarland standard 4 (∼1.24 × 109 CFU/ml) based on the growth success of our isolate in the preculture stage. However, any of the four McFarland standards can be chosen, and a lower McFarland standard can be used if the isolate of interest grows poorly.\nThis protocol applies principles from Casciato et al. (1975[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0010]) to a high-throughput method with 48-well plates, allowing triplicate replicates and testing of multiple factors under the same conditions. Another novel development in this protocol is that there is no need for physical McFarland standards. These have been replaced with Equations 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-disp-0001] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-disp-0002], which we generated by graphing McFarland standards on an exponential curve against their approximate CFU/ml concentrations. These equations speed up and simplify the calculation of bacterial growth rates.",
    "For isolates with exponential growth, equations are provided to calculate growth rates as either a doubling time (in hr) or a growth rate constant (α in min-1), two long-established ways to express bacterial growth rates (Hall et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0020]). However, because previously uncultured anaerobic bacteria are often slow growing, the usual exponential growth profile may not apply. For isolates with linear growth, such as isolates BP5G and BP52G, bacterial growth rate can be calculated as an increase in colony forming units over time (CFU/hr). All of these growth rates will allow direct comparison of the growth effects of medium ingredients in order to develop an optimal medium.\nGrowth rates are estimates and interpreting them requires some judgement, as many confounding factors can affect absorbance readings and therefore growth rate calculations (Hall et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0020]). Hall et al. (2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0020]) recommend that results can be considered unreliable if the standard error is >3% of growth or if the correlation coefficient is <0.995.\nMaterials\nSingle colony isolates to be tested (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-prot-0002])\n90-mm YCFA-GF plates (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-prot-0001])\nWater-gel (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-rec-0008])\n48-well plate(s) with media to be tested (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-prot-0001])\nAnaerobic hood\nDisposable sterile inoculating loops (Thomas Scientific, cat. no. 1230Z30)\nDisposable sterile delta cell spreader (Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 50-751-5036, optional)\n20°C incubator\n2-ml microcentrifuge tubes (Eppendorf Safe-Lock tubes, Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no.

Working in an anaerobic hood, use disposable inoculating loops to streak single colony isolates onto separate 90-mm Petri dishes containing solid YCFA-GF medium (one isolate per plate). Streak isolates over the entire plate.",
    "2. Place inoculated dishes in an anaerobic jar inside an anaerobic chamber.\nSee Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-prot-0002] (steps 3 and 5) for details about maintaining anaerobic conditions inside an anaerobic jar and chamber.\n3. Remove sealed jar from the anaerobic chamber and gas with 47.5%, 47.5%, 5% (v/v/v) N2/CO2/H2 at 5 psi using the Hungate apparatus with copper tube inserted into the jar (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-fig-0003]).\n4. Place sealed jar in a 20°C incubator for 3 days or to peak growth phase of the chosen isolates under these conditions.\nBacterial incubation should be maintained at the ambient seawater temperature of 17-23°C, because the gut environment of K. sydneyanus is also within this temperature range (Mountfort et al., 2002[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0036]).\n5. Inside the anaerobic chamber, pipette 2000 μl water-gel onto each dish with an isolate culture. Resuspend bacteria in the water-gel by gently rubbing the surface with a disposable cell spreader or inoculating loop.\n6. Tip the dish to gather all of the suspension at one side, then pipette the suspension from just above the agar layer and transfer to a 2-ml microcentrifuge tube.\n7. Transfer 100 μl to a 96-well plate, then remove from the anaerobic chamber and measure the absorbance at 600 nm (OD600) in an absorbance microplate reader. Use 100 μl sterile water-gel in a second well as a blank reference.\nThe volume of sample in the 96-well plate must remain consistent as the distance the light has to travel affects the absorbance readings. The same volume should be used for absorbance readings in the 96-well plate at all stages of the protocol.\n8. Calculate the preculture cell concentration using Equation 1:\n         \nformula:\n\\begin{equation} {\\rm{Cell}}\\;{\\rm{density}}\\;(\\times {10^8}\\;{\\rm{CFU}}/{\\rm{ml}}) = 1.1449\\;{\\rm e^{3.5633 \\times \\left( {{\\rm{OD}}600} \\right)}} \\end{equation}",
    "This equation explains the exponential relationship between approximate cell density and absorbance at 600 nm among the widely used McFarland standards (Casciato et al., 1975[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0010]; McFarland, 1907[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0032]). It is the equation of the exponential trendline from a graph plotting these two variables against one another for each of the four McFarland standards.\n9. Calculate the amount of water-gel needed to reconstitute a cell pellet from the water-gel sample to McFarland standard 4 (∼12.4 × 108 CFU/ml) using Equation 2:\n         \nformula:\n\\begin{equation} {\\rm{Volume\\;water - gel\\;}}\\left( {{\\rm{ml}}} \\right) = 2\\;{\\rm{ml}}\\; \\times \\;\\frac{{{\\rm{cell\\;density\\;of\\;sample\\;}}\\left({{{10}^8}\\;{\\rm{CFU/ml}}} \\right)}}{{\\left( {1.24\\; \\times \\;{{10}^9}\\;{\\rm{CFU/ml}}} \\right)}} \\end{equation}\nThis equation finds the numerical ratio between the cell density in the sample and the desired cell density of McFarland standard 4 and multiplies it by the suspension sample volume (2 ml).\n10. Inside the anaerobic chamber, centrifuge the 2 ml of water-gel suspension for 90 s at 1500 × g to pellet the bacteria in this sample.\n11. Inside the anaerobic chamber, remove the supernatant, add the calculated volume of water-gel, and pipette gently up and down to resuspend the pellet.\nGentle pipetting is important to minimize sheer stress effects on the bacterial cells.\nPerform growth rate experiment\n12. Inoculate 10 μl reconstituted pellet onto the solid medium in the appropriate wells of a prepared 48-well plate. Using the example layout in Figure 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-fig-0006], plate three replicates in columns 1-3 and 5-7.\nEach well is inoculated with the same volume of bacteria at the same concentration, allowing direct comparison of growth rates and analysis of the growth effects of different medium ingredients.\nUsing three replicates reduces the influence of any edge effects that can cause differences in absorption between wells. Columns 4 and 8 are used as no isolate controls.",
    "13. Take the t = 0 hr timepoint by pipetting 100 μl water-gel onto the appropriate wells (wells A1-8 in Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-fig-0006]), resuspending the bacteria by lightly scraping with a disposable inoculating loop, and transferring to a 96-well plate.\n14. Measure the OD600. Use 100 μl sterile water-gel in a second well as a blank reference.\nAbsorbance can be converted to cell concentration using Equation 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-disp-0001]. Time zero readings are used for analysis purposes only, not for growth rate calculations, as they are outside the growth period.\n15. Repeat for at least four additional timepoints during the growth phase.\nAs recommended by Hall et al. (2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0020]), growth rate calculations should use a window of at least four timepoints over the growth period, after lag phase and before stationary phase. Growth phases vary among bacteria and must be determined by preliminary experiments on a chosen isolate. For our isolates, the growth phase lasted from 3 to 26 hr and timepoints were taken within this range (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-fig-0006]).\nCalculate bacterial growth rates\n16. For linear growth, calculate CFU/hr:\n         \nUse Equation 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-disp-0001] to convert absorbance readings to approximate cell density for each well (× 108 CFU/ml).\nMultiply these values by 0.1 ml (the sample volume for absorbance measurements) to convert cell density to the approximate cell number in each well (× 108 CFU/well).\nPlot CFU/well against time and apply a linear trend line. Determine the growth rate (in CFU/hr) as the gradient of this line.\n17. For exponential growth, calculate the first-order growth rate constant (α):\n         \nPlot the natural log of the mean OD values (lnN) versus time (in hr) using a graphing program.\nUse the software to generate a linear trendline between two points (at times t and 0).\nUse Equation 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-disp-0003] to calculate α:\n               \nformula:",
    "\\begin{equation} {\\rm{ln}}\\frac{{{N_t}}}{{{N_0}}} = {\\rm{\\;\\alpha }}\\left( {t - {\\rm{\\;}}{t_0}} \\right) \\end{equation}\nThis equation is generated from the gradient of a straight line drawn between two points at times t and 0 on a graph of lnN versus t during the exponential growth phase as explained in Hall et al. (2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0020]). When t is measured in minutes, α is reported in reciprocal minutes (min–1).\n18. For exponential growth, also calculate the doubling time:\n         \nPlot mean OD values versus time (in hr) using a graphing program.\nApply an exponential trendline to the graph.\nUse the equation associated with this exponential trendline to determine the κ coefficient as the exponential index.\nUse the κ coefficient in Equation 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-disp-0004] to calculate the doubling time:\n               \nformula:\n\\begin{equation} {\\rm{Doubling\\;time\\;(hr)}} = \\;\\frac{{\\rm l{n2}}}{{\\rm \\kappa \\;coefficient}} \\end{equation}\nThe calculation of doubling time (hr) using this equation is from Hall et al. (2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0020]). The κ coefficient is associated with exponential bacterial growth."
