    "1. Theoretical preparation\nDefine three parameters: liquid absorbance (Al), solid absorbance (As), and threshold time (tT)17.\nRewrite the traditional Jacobs working curve using these three parameters17 according to Equation 1:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65277/65277eq01.jpg     (Equation 1)\n\tHere, tH is the curing time of one single layer, and H is the height of one single layer.\n2. Parameter acquisition\nMeasure the threshold time of the bioink using a rheometer equipped with an element for temperature control.\n\t\nUse a 365 nm light source to expose the testing platform of the rheometer and make the light intensity at a certain value.\nSet the rheometer to get the Time-Moduli data during a period of 300 s, and take each data point every 0.3 s through the Time Settings options in the rheometer software.Click the Start Test button of the rheometer to start the test, and at the same time, click the Start Button of the light source.\nCounting from the start of exposure, when the storage modulus data is equal to the loss modulus data, the corresponding time is recognized as the threshold time. Record manually.\nBuild the absorbance test equipment as shown in the previous work17. Use two upper and lower glass slides to clamp the ring-shaped printed structure (5 mm inner diameter, 10 mm outer diameter) with a thickness of 500µm so that the inner circle of the ring forms a chamber. Place the chamber on the test area of the light intensity meter and set the light source to expose the chamber area.\n\tNOTE: Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of photorheological test results and data processing results, and the absorbance testing equipment.",
    "Measure the incident light intensity (Ii) when the test chamber is not filled with material from the absorbance test equipment by reading the display of the light intensity meter of the testing equipment.\nFill the test chamber with 10 µLof bioink.\nExpose the test chamber with bioink to UV light at 365 nm. Obtain the light intensity (Ilh) from the absorbance test equipment by reading the display of the light intensity meter of the testing equipment.\nObtain the light intensity when the bioink is cured (Ish) from the absorbance test equipment by reading the display of the light intensity meter of the testing equipment when the value no longer changes. This value is the solid absorbance, Ish.\nCalculate the liquid absorbance and solid absorbance using Equations 2 and 3:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65277/65277eq02.jpg     Equation 2\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65277/65277eq03.jpg     Equation 3\nObtain the Jacobs working curve according to the obtained parameters.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65277/65277fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Test results and equipment.

Continuous DLP printing parameter settings\nUse DLP software to achieve DLP printing, and the set of printing parameters in the software as follows.\nSet the exposure time of the first single layer as the threshold time (tT) in the software's parameter settings.\n\t\nCalculate the exposure time of curing 10 µmthick materials according to Equation 1 and subtract the threshold time to obtain the real exposure time for curing a single layer.\nSet the time interval between adjacent layers to 0 s in the software's parameter settings.",
