This is important to ensure an accurate cell count and an even distribution of cells upon seeding into wells.\nPerform cell counting using 10 μL of cell suspension using an automated cell counter or a hemocytometer to calculate cell number and prepare the cell suspension at the desired cell density for seeding.\nNote: For this protocol, prepare a cell suspension at 100,000 cells/mL media.",
    "Note: Using an automated cell counter system (for example, Invitrogen Countess 3 Automated Cell Counter) can help identify the proportion of live and dead cells while performing cell counting. One freeze-and-thaw cycle is expected to cause about 5%–10% cell death.\nSeed 100 μL resuspended cell solution with a density of 100,000 cells/mL media into one well of a 96-well plate.\nMaturation of cortical neural progenitors\nTiming: 15 days\nNote: Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] outlines the cortical neuron differentiation protocol.\nAt 24 h after cell seeding, using a light microscope confirm cells have survived, attached to the plate, and are evenly distributed within the well.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2744-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic figure of the protocol to generate highly homogeneous mature cortical neuronal cultures that enables identification of individual neurites – ideal for neurite segmentation essential for neuron morphological assessment\nCritical: Low cell densities will have a significant impact on neuron maturation. If the cell cultures have more than 20–25% cell death, then it is best to discard and repeat the experiment.\nDay 1: remove the cortical base media with Y27632 and gently wash each well once with PBS −/− to remove residual Y27632. Replace media with cortical differentiation base media without Y27632.\nNote: On day 1 and 3, perform a 100% media change i.e., replace all 100 μL of media. The media used on these two days are different.\nDays 3–15: Replace media with cortical maturation media supplemented with growth factors BGDAL (growth factor concentrations and abbreviations and detailed in Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5]) and ϒ-secretase complex/notch pathway inhibitor (DAPT).\nCritical: the growth factors should be added to the media on the day of media change to minimize degradation.\nNote: Media change should be performed every second day. As neurons mature, they are more sensitive to total media aspiration.",
    "Note: From days 5 to 15, perform 90% media change i.e., remove 90 μL media and add 90 μL fresh media. The differentiation media on days 5–15 is the same. So, the 10% left-over media will not impact the concentration of the growth factors.\nNote: At the end of step 11, cortical neurons are day 40 of maturation, noting cells are cryopreserved at day 25 after the onset of iPSc cortical differentiation, plus a additional 15 days in culture (according to the aforementioned steps).\nImmunostaining of mature cortical neurons\nTiming: 5 h\nThis section outlines how to perform immunostaining3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] of mature cortical neurons.\nNote: A ready to use kit, Cytofix/CytopermTMFixation/Permeabilization Kit was used for the fixation, blocking, antibody incubations and wash steps involved in the immunofluorescence staining protocol.\nNote: The volume added to each well of the 96-well plate is 100 μL in steps 12 to 26.\nAspirate media and wash wells once with PBS−/− to remove residual media. Add 100 μL of Cytofix solution for 25 min at room temperature (20–25).\nAspirate Cytofix solution and wash cells twice with PBS−/−.\nTo permeabilize and block the cells for immunostaining, add Cytoperm solution for 30 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nPause point: If it is not possible to continue performing further immunostaining steps on the same day, the samples can be stored at 4°C overnight (16–18 h).\nPrepare 1:1000 diluted primary antibodies in Cytoperm solution.\nAspirate the Cytoperm solution from the wells and add the diluted primary antibodies into wells.\nIncubate at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 1 h.\nWash the cells twice in Cytoperm solution to remove primary antibodies.\nPrepare 1:500 diluted secondary antibodies in Cytoperm solution.\nAdd the diluted secondary antibodies into wells.\nIncubate the plate at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 30 min.",
    "Wash the cells twice in Cytoperm solution to remove secondary antibodies.\nPrepare 1:10,000 diluted Hoechst in Cytoperm solution.\nAdd the diluted Hoechst into wells.\nIncubate the plate at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 10 min.\nWash the cells twice in Cytoperm solution to remove the residual dyes and then add 100 μL of Cytoperm solution into each well of 96-well plate.\nNote: If the samples are not imaged immediately, the plates should be sealed with Parafilm and stored at 4°C. The plates should be protected from light by wrapping with aluminum foil. It is recommended to image the cells within 48 h of immunostaining before the fluorochromes start fading.\nHigh throughput imaging and analysis of early and mature neurons\nTiming: 2 h\nNote: Here we describe high throughput imaging and analysis performed using the Perkin Elmer PhenixPlus high content screening microscope. Other licensed image analysis software (such as MetaXpress software and Molecular devices), and open source image analysis software (such as Image J) can also be used for assessment of neuron morphology.\nImage the 96-well plate with neurons on PhenixPlus using a 16-bit Andor Zyla 5.5 megapixel sCMOS camera and a 20× water objective. The imaging was done under a 2× digital binning resulting in image size of 2160 × 2160.\nTake z-stacked images to capture neurons at different depths. Image analysis is performed on maximum projection images.\nNote: The depth of the neuronal cultures can vary in different areas within the same well. Ensure appropriate number of image stacks are captured to image the entire depth of neurons across the well.\nAcquire at least fifteen fields of view per well.\nPerform image analysis using Harmony, the image analysis software, built in with PhenixPlus high-content imaging microscope.\nConduct neurite morphology assessment.",
    "Measure parameters of neurite outgrowth, neurite length, roots, extremities, and segments in early (Day 1 post seeding neural progenitor cells) and mature neurons (Day 15 post seeding neural progenitor cells) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2744-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Neurite morphology assessment\n(A) Early neurons i.e., Day 1 after thawing neural progenitors.\n(B) Mature neurons i.e., Day 15 after thawing neural progenitors.\n(C) Harmony (Perkin Elmer) image analysis software-based analysis sequence for automated analysis of neurite morphology.\n(D and E) shows the identification of nucleus and neurites in early (D) and mature (E) neurons.\n(F–J) shows that our assay is sensitive to changes in neurite morphology as shown by increased (F) neurite length (G) neurite roots (H) Neurite segments, (I) neurite extremities and (J) neurite branching in Day 15 mature neurons compared to Day1 early neurons.\nAll experiments were performed in duplicate wells. Mean ± SEM. Scale: 100 μm.\nLabel neurons with Hoechst (to identify nuclei) and MAP2 (to identify MAP2 positive neurites) and image (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B).\nAnalyze images of neurons using image analysis pipeline, detailed in steps 32 and 33 below (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nSegment nuclei and neurites (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D and 2E) and measure neurite outgrowth parameters (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F–2J). The dataset for Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F–2J is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7882382[href=https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7882382].\nNote: The Harmony software provides building blocks for image segmentation. Segmentation involved breaking down the image into discrete objects such as individual nuclei or neurites.\nNote: Before finding neurites, we segmented the image using the “Find nuclei” building block to identify the nucleus that the neurites extend from.\nOptimally segment fluorescently labelled nuclei by applying 1 of 4 pre-defined methods in the “Find nuclei” building block.\nTo choose the best pre-defined method, test all the methods available and choose the one method that is most convincing visually to have accurately selected nuclei.",
    "Test this in multiple different fields of views in multiple wells to ensure the selected method works well across different conditions.\nNote: The pre-defined “Find nuclei” functions generally work quite well. However, if needed parameters such as nuclei area, threshold and contrast can be tweaked to suit your images. A cell number dilution series experiment can be setup to test and validate which pre-defined method works well for your cells.\nMeasure parameters of neurite outgrowth including neurite length, branching, extremities, and segments using the “Find neurites” building block.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2744-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Neuron maturation assessment\n(A–F) Neurons labelled with Hoechst (A), mature cortical marker TBR1 (B) and merged imaged of Hoechst and TBR1 (C). Neurons labelled with Hoechst (D), mature cortical marker CTIP2 (E) and merged imaged of Hoechst and CTIP2 (F).\n(G and H) Harmony (Perkin Elmer) image analysis software-based analysis sequence for automated analysis of neuron images to measure the percentage of neurons positive for mature cortical marker TBR1 (G) and CTIP2 (H). Negative isotype control was used to set the threshold to identify positively stained cells.\n(I) Percentage of neurons positive for TBR1 and CTIP2 cortical neuronal markers. All experiments were performed in duplicate wells. Mean ± SEM. Scale: 100 μm.\nNote: The “Find neurites” building block is tailored to detect neurites and provides a set of interactive illustrations and tuning dialogues to visualize the neurite detection results and adjust the parameters if required. Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C shows the parameters we used. We measured the neurite outgrowth parameters for the early (Day1) and mature (Day 15) neurons. As expected, Day 15 mature neurons had relatively longer and more complex MAP2 positive neurites (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F–2J).\nConduct neuronal maturation assessment (mature neurons).\nLabel neurons with Hoechst (to identify nuclei) and TBR1 or CTIP2 (to identify mature cortical neurons) (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A–3F).",
    "Note: TBR1 and CTIP2 mature cortical markers are expressed in the nucleus4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 3E).\nAnalyze the images using image analysis pipeline presented in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G (for TBR1) and 3H (for CTIP2).\nUse the “find nuclei” building block to segment the image and find nuclei (as described in step 32).\nUse the “Calculate Intensity Properties” building block to determine the fluorescence intensity of TBR1/CTIP2 markers in the nucleus region.\nNote: Nucleus expressing the TBR1/CTIP2 markers will have a high fluorescence intensity. Set an intensity threshold using an isotype control to identify positively stained nuclei.\nMeasure the percentage of TBR1 and CTIP2 positive cells using the formula: (number of TBR1/CTIP2 positive nuclei ÷ total number of Hoechst labelled nuclei) ∗ 100 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]H).\nNote: Percentage of other mature cortical markers such BRN2, SATB2 and CUX1 can also be measured using the same image analysis pipeline."
