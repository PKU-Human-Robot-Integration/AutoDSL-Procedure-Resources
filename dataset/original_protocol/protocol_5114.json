    "Digest procedureEnzyme solutions (50 µl) as received (-80 °C) are permitted to warm to RT then diluted to 500 µl with the appropriate storage buffer giving, nominally, 0.5 IU per 500 µl. Aliquots (5 µl) are stored frozen (-80 °C) until needed. These 5 µl aliquots contain 5 mIU of activity according to the supplier's specification. However, when the enzyme activities were assayed using Celsus heparan sulfate and the digestion conditions described below, they were found to be 2.8, 5.0 and 13.8 mIU for Heparin lyases (HL) I, II and III, respectively. HL activities should be independently verified prior to starting the depolymerisation procedure. Heparin or HS (1 mg, in duplicate) is dissolved in a microcentrifuge tube (1.5 ml) with the digestion media (470 µl).Sequential enzyme addition is completed.HL I (one 5 µl aliquot) is added and the solution incubated (37 °C, 2 h, inversion at 9 rpm).HL III (5 µl) is added and incubation continued (1 h).HL II (5 µl) is added and incubation continued (18 h).All three enzymes (an additional 5 µl of each) are added at the same time and the solution incubated (gentle inversion, 9 rpm) for a further 24 h.Digests are terminated by heating (100 °C, 5 min).Samples are centrifuged (14,000 x g, 10 min) and the supernatant recovered.The supernatants (2 mg/ml) are then accurately diluted with water to give 100 µg/ml solutions, by taking 50 µl of supernatant and adding 950 µl of water. The 100 µg/ml solutions are then filtered (0.22 µm) and analysed.Analysis procedureHPLC is completed using a binary solvent system and a flow rate of 1 ml/min at 40 °C.",
    "Following long-term storage and prior to injecting the first sample, the column is conditioned by flushing thoroughly with water, then with 100% B for 10 min before equilibrating the column with the starting conditions (0% B) for 2 min. Digest and standard solutions (see below) are injected by autosampler (50 µl injection volume) and the disaccharides separated using a gradient system, 0% B (1 min), 0% to 35% B (over 31 min), 35% to 65% B (over 15 min), 100% B (10 min). Post analysis column re-equilibration 0% B (3 min).Disaccharides are detected by absorbance at their absorbance maxima of 232 nm.Standard curves for each disaccharide standard are prepared by dissolution of each of the twelve heparin-derived disaccharide standards (supplied as 1.0 mg samples) to give 1 mg/ml stock solutions in water. These stock solutions are in turn used to prepare a twelve disaccharide standard mix containing 20 µg/ml of each standard which was subsequently serially diluted to prepare solutions containing 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625 and 0.3125 µg/ml of each disaccharide. These standard solutions are analysed with each batch of digests (see Figure 1). Linear calibration curves (concentration vs peak area) with R2 values of > 0.998 can be generated.For the enzyme digests, data reported are the average of two digests. Each digest is analysed by HPLC in duplicate (Figure 1). Disaccharides in the digest can be identified by elution times relative to the twelve heparin-derived disaccharide standards and quantified using the calibration curves. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170325/20170325021652_5862.jpgFigure 1.

    "775 min, Δ-UA(2S)-GlcNS(6S). The elution order of the twelve disaccharide standards was initially determined by running each species separately under the chromatographic conditions described above."
