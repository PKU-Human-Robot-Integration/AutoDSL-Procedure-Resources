  "procedures": [
    "All methods were conducted according to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the German law for the welfare of animals, and they were approved by local authorities (Regierungspräsidium Tübingen).\n1. Induction of Experimental Nephrotic Syndrome by Doxorubicin Injection to the Retrobulbar Sinus\nPrepare a 0.5 mL syringe with a mounted 30G cannula by marking the stop position of the piston.\nCalculate injection volume of doxorubicin for male (7.25 µL/g body weight (bw) equal to 14.5 µg/g bw doxorubicin) and female mice (6.9 µL/g bw equal to 13.8 µg/g bw doxorubicin) according to the body weight from the morning.\n\tNOTE: The given dose is appropriate for induction of nephrotic syndrome. Minor changes in dosage lead to a crucial different course of nephropathy reaching from mild chronic kidney disease with only small changes in glomerular filtration rate (12.6 µg/g bw doxorubicin) to acute kidney failure (15.4 µg/g bw doxorubicin)7,15.\nWarm the calculated amount of doxorubicin solution (2 µg/µL) in a 37 °C warm chamber.\n\tCaution: Doxorubicin is harmful if swallowed and can cause cancer. Always wear gloves if working with doxorubicin and avoid any skin contact.\nPrefill the syringe with doxorubicin solution until the marking point and set the balance to zero. Fill the syringe with the injection volume and check the volume by weighing the syringe.\nNarcotize the mouse deeply with 5 vol% isoflurane using a vaporizer and oxygen flow of 2 L/min.\n\t\nDo not use ointment on the eyes prior to the injection. The operator needs a clear view of the orbital cavity for performing a safe and successful retrobulbar injection.\nAssess the level of anesthesia by pedal reflex and adjust anesthetic delivery if necessary before starting injection.",
    "Place the mouse at a right lateral recumbency with its back facing to the operator's body and its head facing to the operator's injection hand.\n\tNOTE: The procedure is described for a right-handed person, for left-handed persons performing the injection with the left hand it is easier to do the position and injection reversed right to left.\nCarefully protrude the mouse's left eyeball from the eye socket by applying gentle pressure to the skin, dorsal and ventral to the eye.\nPuncture the left retrobulbar sinus from the inner eye angle (medial palpebral commissure). Avoid any contact with the mouse´s eyeball.\nSlightly tilt the syringe and inject entire volume in one go. Make sure that the volume is injected without any resistance and without any signs of extravasation such as exopthalmus or leakage from the injection site.\nSince doxorubicin is a highly toxic substance, check well-being at least once a day by using a score-sheet according to Morton and Griffiths et al.16 and pay special attention to the injection site. If any signs of extravasation like exopthalmus, impaired eyelid closure or any signs of necrosis like swelling or skin lesions occure after injection or in the following days, the mouse should be euthanized.\n2. Implantation of Sustained-Release Pellets Containing Aprotinin\nOrder pellets with the desired dose per day and release duration in advance. In case of aprotinin, choose a dose of 1 mg per day to be released over 10 days.\n\tNOTE: In this study, the aprotinin pellets contain a dose of 10 mg.\n\t\nStore the pellets under dry conditions and avoid any exposure to humidity.",
    "Prepare required items for the surgery, including a pair of hair scissors, a pair of skin preparation scissors, a scalpel, surgical tweezers, two pairs of tissue tweezers, a needle holder, and 15 cm monofile suture non resorbable.\n\t\nSterilize the instruments using a heat sterilizer for 5 min at 240 °C. Before using the instruments, wait for 5 min until they reach room temperature.\n\t\t\nAvoid any contact of sterilized instrument tips to nonsterile surfaces.\nAvoid skin burn by hot instruments.\nNarcotize mouse with isoflurane 5 vol% followed by 1.5 vol% using a vaporizer and oxygen flow of 2 L/min.\nPlace the mouse in a prone position on a warming device covered with a layer of gauze to avoid thermal injuries to the mouse. Surface temperature is about 37 °C.\nProtect the eyes with ointment.\nRemove the hair on the middle back in an area of about 0.5 cm2 using scissors or a hair trimmer and disinfect the hairless skin with a disinfectant suitable for skin disinfection. Remove as less hair as possible so it stays more difficult for the mouse to reach the wound and thread ends later and to keep body temperature.\nIncise the hairless skin with a scalpel in cranio-caudal direction in a length of about 5 mm. Prepare a left lateral pouch of about 1 cm depth in the subcutaneous connective tissue using a blunt preparation.\n\t\nAssess the level of anesthesia by pedal reflex and adjust anesthetic delivery if necessary before starting surgery.\nInsert one 10-day release pellet into the prepared left lateral pouch using sterile tissue tweezers. Leave the pellet at the bottom of the pouch in a planar position.\n\t\nAvoid any contact of the pellet to fluid and humidity till placed in the prepared pouch.",
    "Close the skin with 2-3 sutures. Only leave very short thread ends to make it more difficult for the mouse to open the sutures by gnawing.\nPlace the mice individually to reduce postoperative distress and to prevent opening of the sutures by gnawing. Keep the mouse in view until it has regained sufficient consciousness after narcosis.\n\tNOTE: There is no need for postoperative pain management since this intervention is well tolerated without any signs of discomfort or pain. Alternatively we recommend topical analgesics, e.g. a drop of bupivacaine on the incision prior to closure which would provide up to 8 h of analgesia.\n3. Assessment for Model Induction, Signs of Nephrotic Syndrome and well-being\nCollect morning urine (08:00 am) into a reaction cup (1.5 mL) every day from the injection day by massaging the bladder.\n\t\nMeasure proteinuria by using Bradford protein assay and normalize to creatinine.\n\t\tNOTE: For induction of nephrotic syndrome, proteinuria should reach a threshold of 120 mg/mg creatinine between day 7 and 10 after doxorubicin injection.\nLook for the development of ascites. Check for increase of abdominal circumference or overhanging flanks.\nWeigh the mouse, the food pellets and the drinking bottle in the morning (08:00 am) every day.\nCheck well-being at least once a day by using a score-sheet according to Morton and Griffiths et al.16\n4. Measurement of Urinary Serine Protease with a Chromogenic Assay\nPrepare substrate working solution by adding 15 mL of sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to a bottle of 25 mg of lyophilised chromogenic substrate S-2251, yielding a concentration of 2 mM. Dissolve aprotinin in PBS to obtain an aprotinin solution with a concentration of 2 mg/mL.\n\t\nStore prepared solutions at -20 °C. This significantly slows the auto-degradation of S-2251. Do not use old solutions with a strong shade of yellow.",
    "Use freshly prepared or thawed substrate working solution and warm it in a 37 °C heat chamber.\nThaw urine samples at room temperature.\n\t\nPrevent protease degradation by avoiding repeated thawing and freezing. Store urine samples at -20 °C.\nUse a 96 microwell plate suitable for photometric measurement. Add 3 µL of undiluted urine in each of two wells and add 50 µL of substrate working solution with 3 µL of either PBS or aprotinin solution to the wells. Cover the plate with a plate sealer.\nIncubate the covered microwell plate for 60 min in a 37 °C heat chamber.\nMeasure the optical density of each well at 450 nm using a microplate reader.\nTake the difference between the OD without aprotinin and with aprotinin as urinary aprotinin-sensitive serine protease activity.\n\tNOTE: Measurement of a paired sample with and without aprotinin increases specificity of the assay since the substrate could also be cleaved by other proteases that do not play a pathophysiological role.\nSubscription Required.
