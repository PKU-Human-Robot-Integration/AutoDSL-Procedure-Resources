    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nGlucose tolerance test and insulin secretion\nTiming: 2 days\nThis section will provide specific details on how to perform a glucose tolerance test (GTT) and measure insulin secretion during the test in order to assess glucose homeostasis and determine the beta cell insulin secretory capacity in mice in vivo. There are two different types of glucose tolerance test: oral GTT (OGTT) and intraperitoneal GTT (IPGTT). Both OGTT and IPGTT are important measures to determine glucose homeostasis and measure glucose responsiveness. The difference between the two methods is that the OGTT takes into account the effect of incretin hormones and gastric emptying time whereas IPGTT excludes these effects. We provide here the protocol for both OGTT and IPGTT. Although the protocols are very similar, they differ in the method of glucose administration (oral vs intraperitoneal) and the glucose solution and volume used.\nPreparation for OGTT and IPGTT\nPrepare glucose solution based on the type of GTT performed.\nFor OGTT, prepare 30% of glucose solution (see materials and equipment) and filter glucose solution using a 0.22 μm polyethersulfone membrane filter (Millex GP filter).\nFor IPGTT, use 50% dextrose solution directly.\nWeigh mice and calculate the glucose dosage based on the type of GTT performed.\nFor OGTT, calculate the glucose dosage to gavage 2 g/kg of 30% glucose per mouse, use the following equation:  m o u s e  w e i g h t    k g   ×    2 g / k g   30 g / 100 m L   . For example, the volume for a mouse that weighs 30 g should be 200 μL of glucose solution.",
    "For IPGTT, calculate the glucose dosage to inject 2 g/kg using 50% dextrose solution, use the following equation:  m o u s e  w e i g h t    k g   ×    2 g / k g   50 / 100   . The volume for a mouse that weighs 30 g should be 120 μL of dextrose.\nTransfer the mice to new cages without food and fast mice overnight (length of time depends on animal care facility) to perform experiment next day. Make sure that mice have continuous access to water.\nPrepare sheets to record glucose measurement, label blood collection tubes with the mouse number and time point and keep the glucometer, glucose strips, 1 mL syringes and plastic feeding tubes for OGTT or 0.5 mL insulin syringes for IPGTT, and timer ready for the experiment next day.\nThe following day, prepare glucose syringes for each mouse based on the type of GTT performed.\nFor OGTT, aspirate around 500 μL of glucose in a 1 mL syringe, add the yellow plastic feeding gavage tube to the syringe, and push out the excess glucose till the right volume is reached based on the weight of the mice. Make sure any excess bubbles are removed.\nFor IPGTT, aspirate 300 μL of dextrose solution in the 0.5 mL insulin syringe. Make sure any excess bubbles are removed from the syringe and push out the dextrose solution till the right volume is reached based on the weight of the mice.\nAdd numbing cream (emla cream) to the tail of the mouse for 15 min.\nSnip the end of the mouse tail to allow for bleeding.\nOGTT",
    "Measure the fasting blood glucose level using the glucometer. Gently squeeze the tail of the mouse from the base of the tail to the tip. A drop of blood will appear at the tip of the tail. Wipe away the first drop of blood with a tissue and measure the second drop of blood. Record the measurement.\nCollect 20 μL of fasting blood (0 min) to be used for insulin measurement using EDTA coated blood collection tubes. Keep the tubes on ice.\nRepeat the 0 min blood glucose measurement and blood collection for all mice.\nGavage first mouse with glucose and start timer. Gavage second mouse after 2 min with glucose and so on. Keep 1.5–2 min between each mouse to allow time to measure glucose and collect blood.\nIn addition to the 0 min time point, measure glucose at time points 10, 20, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min. Collect 20 μL of blood at time points 10 and 30 min. Collection of 120 min time point is optional.\nOnce all the time points are collected, feed mice and allow to rest for two to three days before performing any other experiments.\nIPGTT\nMeasure the fasting blood glucose levels and collect 20 μL of fasting blood for all mice for the 0 min time point as explained in the OGTT protocol (Steps 2a–2c).\nIntraperitoneally inject the first mouse with dextrose solution and start timer. Inject second mouse after 2 min with dextrose solution and so on.\nIn addition to the 0 min time point, measure blood glucose at time points 10, 20, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min and collect 20 μL of blood at time points 10 and 30 min.",
    "Once the time points are collected, feed mice and allow mice to rest for two to three days before performing any other experiments.\nInsulin secretion\nTo measure insulin secretion, centrifuge blood collection tubes at 3381×g for 10 min at 4°C.\nPause point: If measurements of insulin secretion will be done on another day, transfer serum to Eppendorf tubes and store at −80°C.\nTo directly measure insulin secretion, use the mouse ultrasensitive insulin ELISA kit and follow the manual’s instructions. The mouse ultrasensitive insulin ELISA kit has superior sensitivity which can reach 0.019 ng/mL based on the volume of serum provided and thus is useful for hypoinsulinemic samples, however alternative mouse insulin ELISA kits can also be used for insulin estimation. We recommend using 10 μL of serum instead of 5 μL of serum as stated in the mouse ultrasensitive insulin ELISA kit protocol.\nAbsorbance should be read at 450 nm on a plate reader (Example: Pherastar machine).\nNote: We recommend only involving a maximum of 6–7 mice per person. If 2 people are performing the experiment, we recommend that one person should be responsible for the oral gavage of all mice to minimize variances. We also recommend that each set of mice per person should contain both control and treated mice.\nAlternatives: If the glucose volume to gavage is too high to be given to mice with increased weight, 50% dextrose solution could be used as an alternative.\nPancreas perfusion and islet isolation\nTiming: 3 h",
    "In this section, we provide specific steps on how to perfuse the pancreas and isolate islets to study their function or assess their morphology. This is a terminal experiment. Previous protocols have reported methods for pancreas perfusion and islet isolation (Zhu et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Here, we utilize a slightly different approach where the steps for isolating islets are reduced from previous protocols and no sieve is used to achieve optimal islet yield.\nPancreas perfusion troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nPrepare collagenase solution as stated in the materials and equipment section and keep on ice. Collagenase solution should be prepared with RPMI 1640 media containing PS only as FBS deactivates collagenase.\nFill a 50 mL tube with 5 mL of the collagenase solution. Fill a 3 mL syringe with 3 mL of collagenase and connect to a 30G needle. Refer to Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A for surgical tools used to perfuse the pancreas. Keep tube and syringe on ice.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1443-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Steps of pancreas perfusion\n(A) Surgical tools used for pancreas perfusion.\n(B) Schematic diagram showing locations to i) clamp bile duct before it connects with ampulla of vater and ii) inject collagenase into the bile duct.\n(C) Image of a fully perfused pancreas under the naked eye.\nAnesthetize the mouse using isoflurane. To do that, inside a fume hood, add a few drops of isoflurane to a cotton pad. Add the cotton pad into a box or jar and place a wire mesh on top of the cotton pad to act as barrier between the isoflurane and the mouse. Put the mouse on the wire mesh inside the box so that the mouse does not come in contact with the isoflurane and close the lid. Assess that the mouse is anesthetized by firmly pinching its toes.",
    "Use a conical tube with a cotton pad containing few drops of isoflurane added at the end of tube and place the nose of the mouse close to the terminal end of the tube inside the fume hood to keep mice under anesthesia. Disinfect the skin by spraying ethanol.\nCut through the skin vertically and through the rib cage. Cut the heart out and remove all blood using a 1 mL syringe. Cervical dislocation is another option that can be used followed by cutting the skin vertically to access the bile duct and pancreas.\nGently, push the intestinal organs covering the bile duct to the left until the bile duct is clearly visible.\nUnder a surgical microscope, suture the common bile duct before it connects with the ampulla of vater. This is preferably done by using forceps and a surgical thread. Use the forceps with a curved pointed end to hold on to the end of the surgical thread and go under the bile duct before it connects with the ampulla of vater. Pull the thread from the other side using tissue forceps with a blunted end and make a knot. Alternatively, a clamp could be used to seal the common bile duct before it connects with the ampulla of vater. A schematic diagram illustrates the place of the suture or the clamp (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). Refer to pancreas perfusion part (step 3) in Zhu et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3].\nOnce a knot is made, just under the gallbladder, use tissue forceps with a blunted end (to not puncture the bile duct) and hold under the bile duct to provide a leverage for the needle to penetrate.",
    "Insert the needle into the common bile duct with the needle pointing in the direction of the small intestine without rupturing the bile duct as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nPress on the syringe to fully perfuse and fill up the pancreas with 3 mL of collagenase. A correct perfusion is demonstrated by a blown-up pancreas as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C.\nExtract the pancreas from the mouse body using scissors by starting to cut the pancreas at the spleen, through the intestines and to the visceral fat. Use tissue forceps with a blunted end to hold on to the pancreas. Be careful to not cut parts of other organs as they may contain digestive enzymes which can break the pancreas and digest the islets.\nPlace the pancreas in the 50 mL tube filled with 5 mL of collagenase solution and keep on ice.\nPause point: The pancreas could be kept on ice until all mice have been fully perfused for just a few hours.\nIslet isolation troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nIncubate the pancreas added to the 50 mL tube in a hot bath at 37°C for 11 min.\nAfter the incubation, shake the pancreas gently 4–5 times. Pancreas should be dissolved and the solution should appear cloudy.\nTo stop the digestion, add 45 mL of RPMI media with 10% FBS and 1% PS. The FBS will deactivate the collagenase and stop the digestion.\nPour a bit of the digestion solution onto a petri dish. Keep the rest of the 50 mL tube containing the digestion solution on ice.\nUnder a dissection scope, using a 10 μL pipette, pick the islets from the digestion solution to the first plate. Islets are identified by having a round bright white shape as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1443-Fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2. Appearance of islets under a microscope and after staining\n(A) Picture of islets under a microscope after third pick at a magnification of 2× displaying a bright white shape. Scale bar, 400 μm.\n(B) Dithizone staining on an islet showing dark red color. Scale bar, 50μm.\nTransfer the islets onto a second plate with fresh RPMI media with 10% FBS and 1% PS.\nFrom the second plate, transfer the islets again to a third plate with fresh RPMI media to separate the islets from the exocrine tissue.\nPut the dish containing pure islets in the incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2 to recover until the next day.\nOptional: To ensure that islets have been picked up from the pancreatic digest solution, dithizone staining could be performed on a few islets. This is only a confirmation step to make sure that the user can differentiate and pick the islets from the pancreatic digest. The islets stained with dithizone cannot be used for further steps. First, to prepare dithizone solution, add 40 mg of dithizone to 20 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide and vortex for 3–4 min. Add 5 mL of the solution prepared to 45 mL of magnesium and calcium free PBS. Filter solution and dilute 1:10 for staining. Add the mixture to a few islets in a dish, incubate for 3 min and view under a microscope. Islets will be stained dark red as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B.\nGlucose stimulated insulin secretion\nTiming: 3 h",
    "After isolating islets, we provide specific details on how to perform glucose stimulated insulin secretion to determine islet function and their capacity to secrete insulin. For ex vivo studies, use the islets isolated from mice directly to this step. For in vitro studies, islets are first treated with the substance of interest for 24 or 48 h and then glucose stimulated insulin secretion is performed. Here, we report the use of 30 islets to provide a more reliable and robust insulin response compared to the use of fewer islets (around 10 islets) in previous protocols (Zhu et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nPreparation for glucose stimulated insulin secretion\nPrepare low glucose, high glucose and high glucose with KCl solution as stated in the materials and equipment section by using the KRB solution prepared. KRB should be leveled to a pH of 7.4 before making the glucose solutions. Keep the solutions in a water bath at 37°C.\nLabel a 60 mm petri dish (60 mm × 15 mm) for each treatment and add 4 mL of low glucose solution per petri dish. Keep the dishes in an incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nIn a 24 well plate, for each treatment, add 500 µL of low glucose in one well, 500 µL of high glucose in a second well, and 500 µL of high glucose with KCl in a third well. Keep the plate in an incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nPre-incubation",
    "Under a surgical microscope, transfer 30 islets from the islets isolated in the previous step to the labeled 60 mm petri dish containing low glucose solution. Islets from different treatments or mice should be separated in different dishes. It is important to choose equal sized islets between the different treatment conditions as islets of different size have different insulin secretion responses to glucose. Since 30 islets are used for each treatment or mice, we recommend picking 10 big islets, 10 medium islets and 10 small islets by eye for a total of 30 islets for each different treatment.\nIncubate islets in low glucose solution for 1 h at 37°C.\nLow glucose\nPick islets from the dish into the 24 well plate containing low glucose KRB solution. Repeat for separate treatments or mice. Islets should be picked up slowly with the 10 μL pipette and dispensed very gently to minimize any mechanical stimulation that could occur.\nIncubate for 20 min at 37°C.\nHigh glucose\nPick islets from the low glucose well into well containing the high glucose KRB solution. Repeat for separate treatments.\nIncubate for 20 min at 37°C.\nHigh glucose with KCl\nPick islets from the high glucose well into well containing the high glucose with KCl KRB solution. Repeat for separate treatments.\nIncubate for 20 min at 37°C.\nTotal insulin content\nPick all islets from the high glucose with KCl solution into a 1.5 mL microfuge tube containing 70 uL of acid ethanol solution that is prepared by mixing ethanol, ultrapure water and HCl in the ratio of 150:47:3.\nKeep samples at 4°C overnight (12 h).\nThe next day, evaporate the acid ethanol from the microfuge tubes using a speed vacuum.\nAdd 30 μL of ultra pure water to each sample and vortex.",
    "Heat the sample at 65°C for 10 min.\nSpin all samples at 9391×g for 10 min and keep supernatant.\nMeasure DNA concentration using a nanodrop spectrophotometer. DNA concentration will be used to normalize insulin measurements.\nPause point: Save the low glucose, high glucose and high glucose with KCl solutions for analysis by transferring them into 1.5 mL microfuge tubes. The solutions should be stored at −20°C.\nOptional: We have outlined here how to perform these steps using a 24 well plate. Another way to perform glucose stimulated insulin secretion is to use 1.5 mL microfuge tubes instead of 24 well plates to reduce mechanical stimulation of islets. In this case, the islets are added in microfuge tubes containing 500 μL of low glucose solution for pre-incubation. The same protocol and incubation times are followed. The difference is instead of moving the islets from one well to the next well in a 24 well plate, the islets are kept in the microfuge tube and 300 μL of the solution is taken out and stored in a new microfuge tube and 300 μL of the next solution is added.",
    "Note: We have only demonstrated here the steps for mouse islets. Human islets and MIN6K8 cells were tested using the same procedure with minor optimizations. The media used for human islets is DMEM (1 g/L glucose with 1% PS and 10% FBS). For MIN6 cells, the media used is DMEM (4.5 g/L glucose with 1.75 uL beta-Mercaptoethanol, 1% PS and 10% FBS). It is preferred to use a low glucose concentration of 0 mM and a high glucose concentration of 11 mM for MIN6 cells. Since MIN6 cells are adherent cells, the glucose solutions should be added to the wells containing the cells. First, in a 24 well plate seeded with MIN6 cells, pipette out the media and wash the cells with 500 μL of KRB. Aspirate the KRB and add 500 μL of 0 mM LG solution for pre-incubation. Pipette out the solution and add 500 μL LG solution. Pipette out the LG solution and store for insulin measurements. Repeat process for 11 mM HG solution and 11 mM HG + 30 mM KCl solution. After pipetting out the HG+KCl solution, wash cells with 500 μL KRB. The total insulin content for MIN6 cells can be obtained by adding 200 μL of ultra pure water then freezing and thawing the cells three times. Scratch surface and transfer contents to microfuge tube. Spin at 9391×g for 10 min at 4°C and collect the supernatant. Measure DNA concentration using nanospectrometer.\nHomogeneous time resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assay\nTiming: 6 h",
    "This experiment is used to measure insulin concentration in glucose stimulated insulin secretion and total insulin samples using homogeneous time resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assay. This technology is based on Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) in which two antibodies 1) Cryptate (CR), the antibody donor, and 2) XL655 (XL), the antibody acceptor, are used. When these antibodies bind to insulin and the antibodies are in proximity, the donor excites the acceptor and a fluorescence signal is generated that is read by the machine. We have used the Cisbio HTRF assay kit with a few optimizations. The HTRF assay allows us to measure the insulin concentration for the different glucose concentration and thus determine whether there are any defects in glucose stimulated insulin secretion between different treatments. Alternative methods could be used for measurement of insulin secretion such as insulin ELISA kits, however they are more expensive and include fewer samples to run per plate.\nStandard preparation\nLabel 1.5 mL microfuge tubes with negative control (containing only KRB), positive control, and standards from 1 to 8 (S1-S8).\nTo prepare the standard, dilute the stock of the standard at 1:50 by adding 10 μL of the stock to 490 μL of KRB to achieve a concentration of 10 ng/mL (S8). Perform serial dilutions by taking 200 μL from S8 and mix into 200 μL KRB (S7). Repeat serial dilutions till you reach S1.\nDilute the stock of positive control at 1:10 by adding 10 μL of positive control to 90 μL of KRB.\nSample dilution\nFor each sample, label 1.5 mL microfuge tubes for the dilutions.\nPipette a volume of KRB into each tube to dilute the samples from the GSIS and mix by pipetting the solution up and down. Use the following dilutions:\nNo dilutions for low glucose",
    "1:10 dilution for high glucose (10 μL sample in 90 μL KRB)\n1:20 dilution for high glucose with KCl (10 μL sample in 190 μL KRB)\n1:4000 dilution for total insulin content (10 μL sample in 390 μL KRB and then 10 uL of first dilution into 990 μL KRB)\nAntibody preparation\nMake 1:20 dilutions (10 μL of 190 μL KRB) of each of CR and XL separately and then combine to achieve a 1:40 dilution.\nReading plate\nUsing a 384-well plate, load 10 μL of your negative control, standards (S1–S8), positive control and samples.\nLoad 10 μL of antibody (CR and XL solution) to the negative control, standards, positive control and samples.\nSpin plate for 2 min at 376×g.\nIncubate at room temperature for 4–24 h in a dark drawer.\nRead data using BMG Labtech Pherastar or any alternative HTRF compatible machine. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nCritical: The dilutions should be adjusted accordingly to make sure the insulin measurements are within the range of the standard. Therefore, a test run is recommended where the dilutions for different glucose concentrations are tested before performing the actual run."
