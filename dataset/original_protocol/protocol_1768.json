The bait DSB can be induced by multiple approaches, including transfection, viral transduction, and nucleofection. Here, we describe the procedure of polyethylenimine (PEI)-mediated transfection with a plasmid containing SpCas9-MYC1 in HEK-293T cells.\nNote: If a bait DSB has been generated and then it underwent DSB repair in cells already, please skip this part and proceed with the genomic DNA isolation.\nCulture HEK-293T cells in DMEM/10% FBS medium to a 60%–80% coverage in the 6-cm dish. Two dishes of cells should be prepared. One is set as the control that is without the bait DSB, the other one is for bait DSB generation.\nPEI-mediated plasmid transfection.\nBefore transfection, bring all reagents to room temperature.\nRemove the cell culture medium by aspiration, and add 4–5 mL pre-warmed (37°C) DMEM/10% FBS medium.\nPrepare the transfection mixture.\nAdd 200 μL opti-MEM and 5 μg plasmid containing SpCas9-MYC1 (inducing bait DSB by pX330-MYC1) or GFP (control, pX330-GFP) in a 1.5 mL tube. Mix well with gentle flaps.\nPrepare two 1.5 mL tubes, each containing 200 μL opti-MEM and 10–15 μL PEI (1 mg/mL). Mix well by vortexing or pipetting.\nAdd one diluted PEI (from ii) to one diluted DNA (from i), and the total volume should be less than 450 μL. Mix immediately with gentle flaps and incubate at room temperature for 15 min.\nDropwise add the DNA/PEI mixture to the cell culture by a pipette and put cells into a CO2 incubator for 8–12 h.\nRemove the medium by aspiration and add 5 mL pre-warmed (37°C) DMEM/10% FBS medium.",
    "Harvest transfected cells at 48–72 h post-transfection. Typically, over 0.1 million live cells are required for one PEM-seq library, and 1–3 million cells are recommended.\nAspirate the cell culture medium, wash cells with 3 mL 1× PBS, and aspirate the PBS.\nAdd 400 μL 0.05% trypsin to cover all cells and incubate at 37°C for 2 min to allow cell detachment and separation.\nAdd 400 μL DMEM/10% FBS medium to quench trypsin and collect cells into a 1.5 mL tube.\nSpin at 300 g, 4°C, for 5 min and remove supernatant.\nWash once with 1 mL 1× PBS, spin, and discard the supernatant.\nIsolating genomic DNA\nTiming: 1 day\nThe genomic DNA for PEM-seq analysis is isolated and purified in this major step.\nNote: Besides the procedures provided below, genomic DNA can be also isolated by any mainstream commercial kits, such as the PureLink Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Thermo), GenElute Mammalian Genomic DNA Miniprep Kits (Sigma-Aldrich), Monarch Genomic DNA Purification Kit (NEB), etc.\nPrepare cell lysis master mixture for each sample by mixing 495 μL of cell lysis buffer and 5 μL of proteinase K (20 mg/mL).\nLoose the cell pellet with flaps, add 500 μL of cell lysis master mixture, and incubate them in a thermomixer at 56°C, 500 rpm, for overnight (10–16 h).\nAdd 500 μL of Isopropanol, mix immediately and thoroughly by inverting and shaking the microtube until the white pellet forms. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]\nPick up the DNA pellet with a pipette tip, transfer it to a new 1.5 mL microtube containing 1 mL 70% (vol/vol) ethanol, and mix thoroughly by inverting and shaking.\nCentrifuge it at 13,000 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant completely, and air-dry the DNA pellet for 2–5 min.",
    "Dissolve the DNA pellet in 150 μL TE buffer and incubate at 56°C, 500 rpm, for at least 4 h.\nCritical: The DNA must be dissolved completely.\nDetermine the concentration of 1 μL of the isolated genomic DNA with a spectrophotometer; the value of A260/280 should be 1.8–2.0.\nPause point: Purified genomic DNA can be stored at −20°C for months or 4°C for a week.\nSonication\nTiming: 2 h\nIn this section, the isolated genomic DNA should be sheared to small fragments with a peak length of 300–700 bp.\nTurn on the Covaris M220 focused-ultrasonicator and pre-cool it to 4°C.\nTransfer 20–50 μg DNA to a microtube-130 and adjust the final volume to 130 μL with nuclease-free water.\nSet the Covaris M220 by following the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.covaris.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/resources_pdf/pn_010252.pdf[href=https://www.covaris.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/resources_pdf/pn_010252.pdf]), and fragment the DNA to a target peak at 300–700 bp:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1357_13.csv\nCritical: The performance of sonication varies with different samples. Carry out a time course based on the above settings. In our lab, we usually set the treatment time at 60 or 50 s for human or mouse genomic DNA, respectively.\nRun 1 μL of the sonicated DNA on a 1% (wt/vol) agarose gel in 1× TAE buffer; the size of DNA should be with a target peak at 300–700 bp. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]\nCritical: The length distribution of DNA fragments is important, as the too short or too long DNA fragments will be lost in PEM-seq libraries. Of note, if the library DNA of PEM-seq is sequenced with a 2 × 250 bp read, the size of fragmented DNA can be larger, such as with a peak at 500–1000 bp. The longer sequencing reads are more precise to identify outcomes, however, a 2 × 150 bp read is good enough for most experiments and is much cheaper.",

If a larger amount of DNA is needed, scale up the mixture.\nAliquot each of the primer anneal mixtures into 4 PCR tubes.\nPerform the primer anneal reaction with the following settings:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1357_15.csv\nCritical: The annealing temperature should be changed according to the melting temperature of biotinylated primer(s).\nSet up the primer extension mixture on ice for each sample as below:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1357_16.csv\nCritical: The amount of Bst 3.0 DNA polymerase is approximately 2 U/μg DNA. If the amount of DNA is more than 20 μg, scale up the polymerase.\nAdd 10 μL aliquots of the primer extension mixture to each PCR tubes in step 18, mix thoroughly by vortex.\nSet the primer extension reaction as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1357_17.csv\nNote: A 15-min of primer extension is sufficient to amplify DNA fragments with a peak length at 500–1000 bp.\nPrimer removal\nTiming: 40 min\nThe exceeded biotinylated primers are removed in this major step, as the residual will be captured by streptavidin beads as well.\nPlace the AMpure XP beads at room temperature for at least 30 min before use.\nAdd 50 μL of pre-warmed AMpure XP beads to each PCR tube with primer extension product by pipetting up and down 15–20 times and then incubate at room temperature for 5 min.",
    "Critical: The volume of AMpure XP beads, every new batch or after a long-time storage, should be tested before use by following the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.beckman.com/reagents/genomic/cleanup-and-size-selection/pcr/a63880[href=https://www.beckman.com/reagents/genomic/cleanup-and-size-selection/pcr/a63880]). Principally, all of the free bio-primer should be removed and all DNA fragments larger than 200 bp should be kept. Typically, we use the beads ratio at 1.0×, which means that 50 μL of the AMpure beads are mixed with 50 μL of the primer extension product.\nPlace PCR tubes on the magnetic stand (DynaMa-PCR Magnet) at room temperature for 5 min.\nRemove and discard the supernatant completely.\nCritical: Hold the PCR tubes on the magnetic stand and do not disturb the AMpure beads.
