    "Paraffin embedding and microtome sectioning Carefully remove the brain or spinal cord and post-fix it in 4% PFA for tissue for one hour up to overnight at 4 °C in a 50 ml Falcon.Note: Prior to paraffin embedding of the brain, mice were subjected to transcardial perfusion. Embed the brain in paraffin by using an automated embedding machine for best results.Use the recommended protocol of your embedding machine. If no particular protocol is recommended, use the following protocol: table:\n﻿0,1\nReagent,Duration\n50% ethanol,1 h\n70% ethanol,2x 2 h\n96% ethanol,2x 1 h\n100% ethanol,2x 1 h\n2-propanol,1 h\nxylene,2x 2 h\nparaffin,2x 2 h",
    "Cut 5 µm sections using a microtome and mount sections on microscope glass slides. Air-dry at room temperature (RT). Store at room RT for future use. Note: A thickness of 5 µm is optimal for subsequent light microscopy. Mounting on slides is most conservative to the integrity of the sections.Gallyas silver impregnation (Overview of protocol see Figure 1)De-paraffinize sections by incubating for 10 min each in xylene, again xylene and 2-propanol/xylene (1:1). Afterwards incubate sections in 100%, 90%, 70%, 50% ethanol and distilled water (dH2O) for 5 min each. Note: Formalin-fixed sections are also suitable for subsequent Gallyas silver staining as described in Pistorio et al., 2005. The conservation of morphology in paraffin sections however is superior to crysections. To suppress staining of non-myelin tissue, incubate sections in pyridine/acetic anhydride (2:1, e.g., 200 ml of pyridine and 100 ml of acetic anhydride) for 30 min at room temperature (RT). Note: Prepare solution fresh, stored solution will turn yellow and needs to be discarded.  Wash 3 times with dH2O, for 10 min each.Submerge sections in incubation solution, microwave for 2 min at 440 W. The incubation solution must not come to boil. The temperature should reach approximately 50 °C. Let it cool down for 10 min at RT until lukewarm. Wash sections 3 times in 0.5% acetic acid for 5 min each. Develop sections in physical developing solution for 3-15 min. After 1-2 min, start monitoring the reaction under the microscope by placing the sections in 1% acetic acid (= interrupts developing reaction). To determine if staining has reached the desired intensity, compare to the optimal result shown in Figure 2. The color of myelin should be dark brown and should display a good contrast as compared to the background.",
    "If too pale, the sections can be exposed once again to the physical developing solution. Repeat until optimal result is reached.Stop the staining reaction by incubating sections 3 times in 1% acetic acid for 5 min each.Wash twice in dH2O for 3 min each.Incubate sections in 2% sodium thiosulfate for 5 min to fix the stain. Wash twice with dH2O for 5 min each.Dehydrate section in 50%, 70%, 90%, 100% ethanol for each 5 min, followed by 2-propanol/xylene (1:1), xylene and again xylene for 10 min each.Mount sections with Eukitt and cover slips.Note: Sections, stored in slides boxes at RT, have a shelf life of many years. Result: Myelin and erythrocytes are stained black, sometimes nuclei are stained too, background is pale yellow (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191114/20191114214702_9124.jpgFigure 1.
