  "title": "Gentamicin Protection Assay to Determine the Number of Intracellular Bacteria during Infection of Human TC7 Intestinal Epithelial Cells by <em>Shigella flexneri</em>",
  "procedures": [
    "Note: The experiment should be carried out in a biosafety level 2 lab. Preparation of bacteria Refer to Procedure A of the Protocol–Plaque Assay to Determine Invasion and Intercellular Dissemination of Shigella flexneri in TC7 human Intestinal Epithelial Cells (Sharma and Puhar, 2019).Preparation of TC7 cellsRefer to Procedure B of the Protocol–Plaque Assay to Determine Invasion and Intercellular Dissemination of Shigella flexneri in TC7 human Intestinal Epithelial Cells (Sharma and Puhar, 2019).Infection and cell lysisDay 3 On Day 3, when the bacteria reach OD600nm = 0.3-0.4, pipette 1-1.5 ml culture into a microcentrifuge tube.Spin the tube at 3,000 x g for 5 min. Aspirate the supernatant. Add an equal volume of PBS at room temperature and resuspend the pellet by tapping the microcentrifuge tube or by gentle vortexing.Repeat Step C2 at least twice and finally resuspend the pellet in infection buffer (see Recipes) at room temperature. Record the OD600nm of the bacterial suspension.The recommended multiplicity of infection (MOI) for this experiment is 5. Since there are 1 x 106 cells in each well, the number of bacteria required per well is 5 x 106.The number of Shigella cells at OD600nm = 1 is 0.5 x 109/ml; hence at OD = z, the number of bacterial cells = z x 0.5 x 109. Calculate the volume of bacterial suspension required for infecting each well using the following formula:Volume of bacterial suspension required (in ml) = 5 x 106/z x 0.5 x 109 Aspirate the medium from the cells and add 2 ml of sterile PBS at room temperature to each well.Swirl the plate gently and carefully aspirate all the liquid. After at least 2 washings, add 2 ml of infection buffer (see Recipes) at room temperature to each well.",
    "Add the desired volume of bacterial suspension (typically about 10 μl, calculated in Step C3) to each well of the 6-well plate. Centrifuge the plate at 180 x g for 10 min at room temperature.Incubate the plate at 37 °C, 10% CO2, for the desired infection time, typically 1 h. When Shigella comes in contact with the cells at the incubation temperature of 37 °C (35 °C and above) the secretion of effector proteins through the T3SS is triggered which mediates the bacterial invasion.After incubation, wash the wells with sterile PBS three times as in Steps C4 and C5.Add 2 ml of gentamicin solution (see Recipes) to each well and incubate the plate for one more hour at 37 °C and 10% CO2. If intracellular bacterial survival and multiplication is assessed, this incubation time can be extended.After incubation with gentamicin, wash the wells thrice with PBS (as in Steps C4 and C5).Aspirate the PBS from the wells and add 1 ml of sodium deoxycholate solution (see Recipes) to lyse the TC7 cells (the bacteria resist deoxycholate).Using a 1 ml pipette, scrape the cells off the surface and pipette up and down to lyse the cells effectively and homogenize the lysate.PlatingPrepare log serial dilutions of this lysate in sterile PBS as follows.Dispense 450 μl of sterile PBS in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes.Add 50 μl of cell lysate to one tube and mark it 10-1 dilution (as in Figure 1). Vortex the tube for a few seconds and transfer 50 μl of suspension from this tube to the next tube containing 450 μl of sterile PBS. Mark this new tube as 10-2 dilution. Repeat this procedure to obtain further dilutions of the lysate (Figure 1).For shorter infection time points, a lower dilution will provide significant results.",
    "For example, if infection time is 1 h, 10-1 dilution is enough; but if the infection time is increased to 2 h, 10-2 dilution would be more appropriate owing to bacterial multiplication. Similarly, consider higher dilutions for even longer infection times.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190701/20190701022236_5366.jpgFigure 1. Schematic representation of logarithmic serial dilution of the cell lysateMark sectors on the agar plates (on the bottom of the plate) as in Figure 2.Put a 10 μl drop of diluted suspension (10-1/10-2/10-3/10-4 as labeled on the plate in Figure 2) on one of the sectors on the TSA plate. Let the drop dry.Put at least three drops of each dilution (R1, R2 and R3 in Figure 2; representing technical replicates). On another plate, mark sectors in a similar way (on the bottom of the plate) and put drops of suspension prepared from the lysate of a duplicate well. This plate serves as another technical replicate.Incubate the plates overnight at 37 °C.Count the colonies in the drop. Only consider the dilutions in which the number of colonies is within the countable range (3-30 colonies).In parallel, make log serial dilutions of the starting bacterial suspension and spot 10 μl drops on TSA plates in a similar way as described above. Incubate the plates overnight at 37 °C, along with the other plates, and count the colonies in the drop similar to Step D10. This colony count of the inoculum serves as a verification of the calculation performed in Step C3.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190701/20190701022305_5979.jpgFigure 2.
