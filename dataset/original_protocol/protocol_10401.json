    "1. Cell Culture\nThaw BM component overnight at 4 °C, on ice.\nWarm medium to 37 °C. To support growth of both 231 cells and CAF, use Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).\n\tNote: The media used will depend upon the cell type and the experimental goals.\nRemove medium from the culture dish (10 cm) of near confluent 231 cells and add 1.5 ml Trypsin/EDTA. Incubate for 1 to 3 min at 37 °C, monitoring for cell detachment. Once cells start to round and come off the plate, stop the reaction by adding 3 ml of the medium containing serum. Pipette the medium and cells into a 15 ml conical tube.\nCentrifuge the medium and cells at 150 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant, and re-suspend the cell pellet in 2 ml medium.\nCount the number of cells per volume using trypan blue and a hemocytometer. Cell viability should be greater than 90%.\nRepeat the process with other cell types to be included in the surrogate. For the surrogate described here, the process is repeated with the CAF.\nDetermine the appropriate volume of each cell suspension to obtain the desired number of cells.\n\tNote: For the surrogate described here, a cell density of 2.1 x 106 cells per 100 µl of ECM, with a 2:1 ratio of epithelial cells to fibroblasts (1.4 x 106 231 cells and 7 x 105 CAF per 100 µl ECM), is used. This cell density is a good starting point; however, the optimal cell density will depend on the cell type, the duration of culture, and the objectives of the experiment.",
    "Place the appropriate volume of each cell suspension into a 15 ml conical tube (one tube for each cell type). Centrifuge the medium and cells at 150 x g for 5 min.\nFollowing centrifugation, remove the supernatant, re-suspend one cell type in cell culture grade water (178.8 µl, see Table 1) and the other cell type in 10x DMEM (100 µl, see Table 1, containing phenol red to monitor pH). Place the tubes containing the cells on ice and proceed quickly to preparation of ECM below. Limit the time that the cells remain in water to preserve viability.\n\tNote: Both 10x DMEM and cell culture grade water are required components of the ECM; therefore, we have chosen to re-suspend cells in both. Here we arbitrarily chose to re-suspend the 231 cells in cell culture grade water and CAF in 10x DMEM, although either cell type could be re-suspended in either of these two components. \n2. Preparation of Cells in ECM (6 mg/ml Bovine Collagen Type I + 10% BM)\nNote: An ECM composed of 90% collagen I + 10% BM was chosen to model invasive breast carcinoma because the tumor stroma in this malignancy is composed primarily of collagen I with components of the BM, such as laminin, collagen IV, and entactin, comprising a smaller portion of the ECM12,13,18,19. \nOn ice, add components listed in Table 1, in order, into a 2 ml microcentrifuge tube.\n\tNote: This amount is enough for 8 solid surrogates or, using the bioreactor system described here, 4 perfused surrogates.\ntable:\n﻿0,1\nPreparation of cells in ECM (6 mg/ml Bovine Collagen Type I + 10% BM),Preparation of cells in ECM (6 mg/ml Bovine Collagen Type I + 10% BM)\n178.8 µl,Cell culture grade water containing the desired number of 231 cells (determined above)",

Preparation of cells in ECM.\nGently mix by pipetting, avoiding formation of bubbles. Monitor the pH level using the phenol red in the 10x DMEM. Check that the mixture is an orange/pink color indicating a pH of ~7. If the pH is too low (too yellow), slowly add additional 7.5% sodium bicarbonate one drop at a time (~ 5 µl) until the appropriate color is reached.\n\t\nKeep mixture on ice and work quickly to prevent premature ECM polymerization.\n3. Surrogate Preparation\nFor solid 3D cultures (Figure 1A):\n\t\nWorking in a cell culture hood using sterile technique, label the lid of a sterile 8-well chamber slide to indicate any experimental variation in surrogates.\nKeeping the chamber slide on ice to prevent premature ECM polymerization, slowly pipette 100 µl of the cell+ECM mixture into each well of the 8-well chamber slide.\n\t\tNote: Pipetting the cell+ECM mixture around the edges of the well first helps to better distribute the cell+ECM mixture in the well.\nIncubate surrogates at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 45 min to allow ECM polymerization.\nFollowing ECM polymerization, add 100 µl culture media to each well and incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for the duration of the experiment, changing culture medium every two days.\nFor perfused 3D cultures in a bioreactor system (Figure 1B):\n\t\nSterilize all bioreactor components for 3D culture setup (i.e., bioreactor, tubing, forceps, and fittings necessary for bioreactor setup) using the process specific for the bioreactor to be used.",
    "For the example bioreactor system utilized here, use a combination of autoclaving (e.g., 12 min exposure at 121.1 °C with 15 min drying) and incubating in 70% ethanol for 1 hr.\nPrepare and assemble the portion of the bioreactor system that will house the surrogate.\n\t\t\nFor the example bioreactor system used here, insert a PDMS foam backbone into the PDMS flow channel tubing using forceps. Push four (400 µm) polymer-coated stainless steel wires into the PDMS foam to generate parallel microchannels.\nIn a cell culture hood, using sterile technique and a 26 gauge needle with syringe, inject the cell+ECM mixture into the area of the perfusion bioreactor designed to contain cells. Proceed quickly to the next step.\nTo ensure more even distribution of cells within the surrogates, place the bioreactor component housing the surrogates into a 50 ml conical tube (under the cell culture hood) and continuously rotate at ~18 rpm while incubating at 37 °C for 45 min to allow ECM polymerization.\n\t\tNote: Rotation can be completed using a rotator in the incubator or an oven with a built in rotator, such as a hybridization oven set at 37 °C.\nConnect the bioreactor assembly containing the surrogate to the perfusion pump using manufacturer's instructions.\n\t\tNote: The specifics of this process will vary depending on the bioreactor and pump being used.\nFor the example bioreactor system used here, remove the stainless steel wires prior to connecting the bioreactor assembly to the pump.\nStart medium perfusion (bulk flow rate of 167.1 µl/min; microchannel wall shear stress of 1 dyne/cm2) in an incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\n\t\tNote: The rate of medium perfusion can be adjusted, depending on the bioreactor setup and the goals and the design of the experiment.",
    "Continue medium perfusion for the duration of the experiment, changing culture medium every seven days.\n4. Surrogate Fixation and Processing (Figure 1C)\nLabel cryomolds and plastic tissue cassettes for surrogate fixation and processing.\nNext, encase surrogates in specimen processing gel, which is an aqueous material that is liquid at warm temperatures, but solidifies at room temperature. The specimen processing gel assists in keeping the surrogates intact during processing and facilitates histologic sectioning14,20-22.\n\t\nMelt specimen processing gel in a 60 °C water bath to liquefy it, keeping at this temperature until ready to use. Move the bioreactor with the surrogate to a biosafety cabinet.\nPipette approximately 300 µl specimen processing gel into the bottom of the labeled cryomold (Figure 1C, left panel).\nUsing a scalpel blade (No. 10 preferred) and forceps carefully remove the surrogate from the bioreactor or from the well of an 8-well chamber slide and place it into the cryomold containing specimen processing gel.\n\t\tNote: Tissue marking dyes (see Materials/Equipment List for a specific example) of different colors can be used to mark surrogates, thereby allowing multiple samples to be included in one tissue cassette in a distinguishable manner. \nPipette approximately 300 µl specimen processing gel to cover the surrogate in the cryomold and incubate at 4 °C for 30 min to solidify.\nOnce the specimen processing gel has solidified, remove the specimen processing gel containing the surrogate from the cryomold, and place it into a tissue cassette.\nPlace the tissue cassette containing the surrogate into 10% neutral buffered formalin for 10 to 12 hr at room temperature to allow complete fixation.\nFollowing fixation, move the tissue cassette containing the surrogate to 70% ethanol until processed to paraffin.",
    "Note: Transferring the surrogate from formalin to ethanol prevents over-fixation with formalin which can cause loss of immunoreactivity of some epitopes23. The length of time in ethanol is not critical. This change of fixative is important if the surrogate will be used for immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence. The fixed surrogate is now ready for processing to paraffin (Figure 1C, middle panel). This processing is typically performed in a tissue processor located in an appropriately equipped histology laboratory. A shorter program is recommended due to the size and delicate nature of the surrogates.24\n5. Sectioning and H&E Staining (Figure 1C, Right Panel)\nFollowing processing of the surrogates to a paraffin block, section them using a standard microtome for sectioning of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues24,25.\n\tNote: This can be performed in a qualified histology laboratory, or in a research laboratory, if properly equipped and experienced. The thickness of the histologic sections can vary depending on the intended use of the sections; however, we typically use sections that are 5 µm in thickness. The PDMS foam used here in the perfused surrogates is easily sectioned with a microtome.\nPlace sections on plain glass histologic slides.\nAfter sectioning, bake the histologic sections at 58 °C for 10-12 hr to prepare for staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Baking melts the paraffin and also allows better adherence of sections to the glass slide.\nH&E staining:\n\t\nSet up the stations described in Table 2 in coplin jars or glass staining dishes, depending on the number of slides to stain. Once reagents are set up, move the sections through each station, in order, incubating for the time indicated below24.\nMount a coverslip to each slide using mounting media.\nAllow mounting media to dry before imaging.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2\nH&E Staining,H&E Staining,H&E Staining\nStation,Solution,Time\n1,Xylene,5 min\n2,Xylene,5 min\n3,Xylene,5 min",

H&E Staining.\n6. Measuring Cell Density\nImage at least one entire H&E stained histologic section of the surrogate using brightfield microscopy at 400X magnification, saving the images as .tif files.\n\tNote: The image processing described has only been completed using color images. While untested, we believe the same processing should also be applicable to grayscale images. \nDownload CellProfiler from the Broad Institute26 (http://cellprofiler.org/download.shtml) and ImageJ from the National Institutes of Health (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/download.html), both of which are publically available at no charge.\nTo measure the area of the surrogate in each image, open ImageJ, select \"Set Measurements\" (under the \"Analyze\" tab), select \"Area\", and then select \"Okay\".\nOpen an image (.tif file) of the surrogate. Using the polygon tool in ImageJ (see Figure 2), outline the area of the surrogate in the image by dragging the mouse and clicking to make anchor points. Use the edges of the ECM as a guide. Once outlined, select \"Measure\" under the \"Analyze\" tab.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54004/54004fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. ImageJ analysis. Screenshot of ImageJ processing.

Do not change any other parameters from the default settings.\n\t\t\tNote: Optimal range of diameters should be determined by opening an image in the input image module and measuring the diameter of nuclei (i.e., the primary object) using the measure length tool.\nSelect \"IdentifySecondaryObjects\" (Figure 7).",
    "Select the input image (image after math correction), select the input objects (nuclei), and name the objects to be identified (cells). Choose the \"propagation\" method to identify secondary objects, use the \"adaptive\" threshold strategy and \"Otsu\" method with \"two classes\" minimizing \"weighted variance\". Select \"no smoothing\" and a threshold correction factor of 1, lower and upper bounds of 0 and 1, and a regularization factor of 0.05. Do not change any other parameters from the default settings.\nSelect \"MeasureObjectSizeShape\" (Figure 8).\n\t\t\nSelect cells (secondary object) and nuclei (primary object) as the objects to be measured.\nSelect \"FilterObjects\" (Figure 9).\n\t\t\nName the output objects and select the nuclei (primary object) as the object to filter.\nKeep the next two parameters as per the default settings. Select \"AreaShape\" as the measurement to filter by category, and \"FormFactor\" as the measurement.\nSelect \"Yes\" to filter using a minimum measurement value and add a minimum value of 0.52.\nSelect \"No\" to filter using a maximum measurement.\nSelect \"Yes\" to retain the outlines of filtered objects and name the outlined image.\nSelect \"ExportToSpreadsheet\" (Figure 10)\n\t\t\nSelect where to save the file and name \"Output Files\".\nAfter the analysis pipeline is generated (Steps 6.7.1 to 6.7.7.1), start \"Test Mode\" in CellProfiler and evaluate each step, including that the nuclei in the test image are appropriately filtered, to ensure optimal parameters were chosen to identify cells. Figure 11 shows an output image from CellProfiler following filtering, where nuclei are correctly identified (circled in green), and the background is filtered out.\nOnce parameters are evaluated and determined to be sufficient, save the project and then click \"Analyze Images\". This project can be used repeatedly for future analysis.",
    "Note: Once parameters have been established, the program is set to analyze all the images in the \"File List\", sequentially. This will result in multiple windows opening for each image analyzed, which causes a longer processing time.\nTo avoid a longer processing time, click the eye icon on all of the modules except \"ExportToSpreadsheet\" under the \"Analysis modules\" section.\nOnce all the surrogate images have been processed by CellProfiler, open the spreadsheet containing the image data generated by CellProfiler and the spreadsheet containing the area measured with ImageJ.
