    "1. Animal Housing\nCage: In order to record the running-wheel activity of an individual rodent, each cage should house a single rodent and running-wheel. Because running wheels can be considered a form of enrichment, all rodents in any study should have similar access to a running wheel.\nBedding changes: Animal handling as well as changes in cages or bedding can all have non-photic effects on circadian rhythms21-23, so, cages with mesh-flooring are ideal because they minimize contact with the animal. Notwithstanding the availability of such a tray-system, bedding changes should be avoided during critical phases of an experiment. Alternatives include using longer-lasting bedding, which would allow for more infrequent cage changes, or changing cages on a pseudo-random schedule.\nIsolation Boxes: Cages should be kept in isolation boxes that are sound-attenuated, light-controlled, and well-ventilated. Depending on the size and configuration of the isolation boxes, the number of cages within each box will typically range from 1-8. When housing multiple cages in a single isolation box, one should be aware that various odors and sounds coming from other animals can have confounding effects on the circadian behavior of individual animals. To avoid these problems, one should attempt to house one cage per isolation box.",
    "Ventilation: Adequate air flow is imperative to making the boxes a comfortable home environment for rodents. The fan in each box should be hooded, so as to prevent light from outside the box from reaching the inside. Also, fans will typically remove air from the box and blow it into the room. Small light-tight vents allow air to enter the isolation boxes from several points, and help to avoid uncomfortable breezes. In order to verify that there is adequate ventilation, the temperature inside the isolation box (when closed for several hours, with the lights on) should be virtually identical to the temperature in the room where it is housed.\nLighting: Environmental light intensity should be the same in all cages. Arrange a single light at a similar location above each cage, and always use the same brand/type of bulb. Use moderate intensity illumination (100-300 lux) at cage level. Avoid excessively high illumination levels, which are more likely to produce direct changes on behavior attributable to the light rather than the circadian system, per se (e.g. masking).\nDarkness/Dim red lighting: If it is necessary to handle or treat animals in the dark (e.g. in constant darkness or nighttime), night vision goggles should be used. Alternatively, because the circadian system is relatively insensitive to red-wavelengths, dim red lighting can be used. The specific red light you use should be tested to ensure it does not alter running-wheel activity (e.g. masking) or adjust the circadian clock (e.g. produce a phase shift).\n2. Data Collection (See Figure 1 - Vitalview Hardware Configuration)",
    "Running wheels: The diameter and ergonomics of the running wheel will change the amount of use24. Thus, use smaller and lighter wheels for mice, and larger heavier wheels for rats. When washing and re-installing wheels, ensure that the wheels are able to spin unobstructed, do not \"wobble\", and that the recording micro-switches are activated by each turn of the wheel.\nMicro-switches: Each revolution of the running wheel should activate a magnetic or mechanical micro-switch. Information from the micro-switch is transmitted via a single channel and recorded by a computer which can bin the data over time (e.g. every 2, 5, 6, or 10 min).\nComputer hardware: Our running-wheel recordings are made with Vitalview, a hardware and software platform developed by Mini Mitter (http://www.minimitter.com/vitalview_software.cfm[href=http://www.minimitter.com/vitalview_software.cfm]). However, there are other recording platforms such as ClockLab, developed by Actimetrics (http://www.actimetrics.com/ClockLab/[href=http://www.actimetrics.com/ClockLab/]). Both platforms bring together data from many single-channel sources (e.g. a single micro-switch activated by a single running wheel) into a single computer file. Data from individual channels can then be graphed and analyzed separately at a later date.\n3. Data Recordings\nFiles: The above mentioned software platforms can be used to separate out single channels so that individual files are created for each running-wheel record. Such data are best visualized and graphed with specially designed programs such as Actiview (Minimitter, Bend, OR), Circadia, or Clocklab (Actimetrics, Wilmette, IL) which can all produce periodograms and actograms. However, single-channel files can also be opened and analyzed using general spreadsheet programs such as Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA).",
    "Calculating Circadian Time (CT): CT 12 is, by definition, the onset of running-wheel activity in nocturnal rodents. In parallel with the 24 hr day, by convention, one circadian day is broken into 24 circadian hr. Accordingly, if the circadian free-running period is 24 hr 30 min as measured by the wall clock, CT 0 will occur approximately 12 hr 15 min after CT12.\nSubscription Required.
