    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nVirus infection\nTiming: 7 days for step 1\nVirus infection.\nPropagate HSV-1 viruses and measure the titers of virus by TCID50 assay on Vero cells (Chen et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Zhou et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). Store the virus at −80°C for 2–4 years. Infect HeLa cells with HSV-1 (MOI = 1) for indicated time.\nDetection of the localization of PARP1 after virus infection\nTiming: 3 days for step 2\nTiming: 5 days for step 3\nDetection of PARP1 localization by immunofluorescence assay.\nSeed HeLa cells in 15 mm glass bottom cell culture dishes (NEST, Jiangsu, China) (about 3 × 105 cells/dish). At 70%–80% confluency, infect cells with HSV-1 (MOI = 1) for 4 h.\nDiscard the culture medium, wash cells twice with sterile 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (500 μL/dish).\nFix the cells with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) for 10–20 min at 25°C.\nWash cells three times with 1×PBS, and treat cells with 1× permeabilization buffer (eBioscience, California, USA) for 5 min at 25°C.\nNote: The incubation time of permeabilization buffer should not be too long.\nAlternatives: 1× permeabilization buffer can be used for cell membrane permeabilization. Alternatively, cells can be treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1×PBS for 10 min.\nWash cells three times with 1×PBS.\nBlock cells with 1% BSA for 30 min at 25°C.\nDilute the PARP1 antibody in QuickBlock Primary antibody diluent for immunostaining (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) at 1:100 and add to the dish, then incubate for 12 h at 4°C.\nWash cells 3 times with 1×PBS, and incubate with 1 mL of secondary antibody (goat anti-Rabbit Alex Fluor594 antibody) (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) (diluted 1:1,000 in 1% BSA) at 25°C for 1 h in the dark.\nNote: Light should be avoided during the incubation of secondary antibody to prevent fluorescence quenching.",
    "Incubate cells with 200 μL DAPI Staining Solution (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) at 25°C for 5–10 min in the dark.\nNote: DAPI incubation time should not be too long to avoid high fluorescent background.\nAfter 3 washes with 1×PBS, add 1 mL of antifade mounting medium. Collect images using a Leica TCS SP8 confocal laser microscopy system (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) with 63× oil immersion.\nNote: It is best to observe dish with antifade mounting medium immediately. If not immediately, it is recommended to store the sample at 4°C in dark for no more than 1 week.\nDetermine PARP1 localization in cells from different dishes. The photos of ten different microscopic fields were taken. The DAPI signal corresponds to the nucleus. The localization of PARP can be analyzed by ImageJ software (1.8.0.172) according to signal segmentation and further data analysis can be carried out using the GraphPad Prism 8 software. Data were representative of three independent experiments with similar results can be found in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2118-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "Seed HeLa cells in 6-well-plates (about 1 × 106 cells/well), and culture for 24 h to reach 70%–80% confluency. Collect cells from two wells as one sample for cytoplasmic and nuclear fraction.\nNote: In our experience, to ensure sample quantity, cells from at least two wells were needed for one group.\nAlternatives: If you want to improve the sample quantity, you can choose one 10 cm dish cells as a sample for cytoplasmic and nuclear extraction.\nCollect cells and wash twice with 1×PBS in the 1.5 mL reaction tube;\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 120 × g and remove the supernatant completely;\nAdd 40 μL Protease inhibitor cocktail (1 tablet in 2 mL PBS), 1 μL 1 M DTT to every 1 mL Buffer A (stocks can be kept at −20°C for 1–3 months) before use. Add 150–200 μL Buffer A supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail and DTT to 20 μL cell pellet, place the tube on ice for 30 min, and centrifuge at 15,000 × g for 6 min. The supernatant is cytoplasmic extract, which is transferred to a pre-cooled 1.5 mL reaction tube.\nNote: Buffer A is best to be prepared freshly and pre-cooled before use. The nucleoplasm must be separated cleanly, and the residual liquid should be aspirated with a pipette.\nWash the pellets 5 times with 500 μL wash buffer (10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 2 mM MgCl2, 20 mM KCl, 100 μM EDTA (pH 8.0)) (stocks can be kept at −20°C for 1–3 months) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail and DTT. Avoid pipetting the pellet, centrifuge at 1,000 × g for 5 min.",
    "Add Protease inhibitor cocktail 40 μL (1 tablet in 2 mL PBS) and 1 M DTT 1 μL for every 1 mL Buffer B (stocks can be kept at −20°C for 1–3 months) before use, add 50–80 μL Buffer B to the pellet, vortex the tube at high speed for 10–15 s every 10 min for a total of 30 min, and place it on ice during the period. Centrifuge the mixture at 15,000 × g for 15–30 min and collect the supernatant as the nuclear extract.\nNote: Buffer B is best prepared freshly and pre-cooled before adding.\nDenature both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions in 1× SDS protein loading buffer (stocks can be kept at −20°C for 3 months) at 95°C for 8 min for the following western blot analysis.\nNote: Collected samples should be stored at −20°C, if they are not tested immediately.\nConfigure and run 10% SDS-PAGE regular gels (https://www.bio-rad.com/[href=https://www.bio-rad.com/]) (stocks can be kept at 4°C for 3 days). Electrophoresis was performed in 1× running buffer (https://www.bio-rad.com/[href=https://www.bio-rad.com/]) (stocks can be kept at 25°C for 1 week). Condensing gel electrophoresis conditions: 80 V, 30 min; separating gel electrophoresis conditions: 100 V, until bromophenol blue runs out of the separating gel;\nMembrane transfer: wet transfer. Transfer the protein to a 0.22 μm pore size nitrocellulose (NC) membrane in 1× transfer buffer (https://www.bio-rad.com/[href=https://www.bio-rad.com/]) (stocks can be kept at 25°C for 1 week) at 100 V for 1.5 h.\nBlocking: 5% skim milk (in 1×TBST) or 5% BSA (in 1×TBST) for 1 h at 25°C.",
    "Dilute the control Primary antibody (anti-IgG Rabbit antibody), Primary antibody (anti-PARP1 Rabbit antibody, anti-tubulin Rabbit antibody and Histone H3 Rabbit antibody) in Blocking buffer (stocks can be kept at 4°C for 1 day) at 1:1,000 dilution. Incubate the NC membrane with the antibody for 12 h at 4°C on a rotator.\nRecover the primary antibody and wash 3 times with 1×TBST (stocks can be kept at 25°C for 1 week) on a shaker; 10 min each time.\nDilute the secondary antibody (Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG Antibody, HRP conjugate[href=https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/mm/ap307p?lang=zh&region=CN]) in 1×TBST at 1:5,000 and incubate the membrane for 1 h at 25°C followed by washing three times with 1×TBST.\nExpose the gel to Supersignal West Pico developer, and then collect the image data by Amersham Imager 600 (General Electric Company, GE). The corresponding protein was detected as marker proteins to indicate the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, respectively (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).

The sites recognized in vitro by DNA-PK are reported to be D/E/Q-S/T-Q, with a glutamine residue on the C-terminal side being important (Lees-Miller and Anderson, 1991[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Watanabe et al., 1994[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). We predict T325 residue of PARP1 as a potential phosphorylation site according to the conserved substrate motif of DNA-PK.\nMass spectrometry detection of PARP1 phosphorylation sites.\nSeed HeLa cells in 10 cm cell culture dish (about 1 × 107 cells/well) and culture for 24 h to reach 70%–80% confluency and infect with HSV-1 (MOI = 1) for 4 h.",
    "Wash cells twice with 1×PBS and lyse using 200 μL RIPA Lysis Buffer (Beyotime Biotechnology, China) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (P8340, Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM of PMSF and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (P5726, Sigma-Aldrich). Centrifuge the lysate with table-top centrifuge at 15,000 × g for 10 min and the cellular debris was discarded.\nNote: After the cells were mixed with lysis buffer, they were immediately placed on a shaker at 4°C for 30 min to thoroughly lyse the cells.\nWash Protein A/G agarose twice with 1 mL 1×PBS and prepared for a 50% protein A/G agarose working solution (in 1×PBS). Incubate the cell lysates with protein A/G agarose (50 μL) and anti-PARP1 antibody (5 μL) at 4°C for 12 h.\nWash the beads with 1 mL 1× PBST (0.5% triton X-100 in 1×PBS) five times, discard the supernatant completely.\nNote: 1×PBST should be pre-cooled before use.\nAdd 30–50 μL 1× protein loading buffer to the beads, 95°C, 10 min, and subject the boiled protein sample to 10% SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis.\nWash the gel (the purpose of this step is to wash off interfering substances such as SDS in the gel, reduce the staining background, and improve the staining sensitivity).\nPut the gel into a sterile 10 cm dish.\nAdd 50 mL of deionized water.\nHeat it in the microwave for 3 min on high heat.\nShake for 5 min on a side-swing shaker or a horizontal shaker.\nStain the gel.\nCarefully pour off the liquid, remove the residual liquid.\nAdd an appropriate amount of Coomassie brilliant blue fast staining solution (about 20 mL for each gel with a size of about 8 cm) to ensure that the staining solution can cover the gel and the liquid level is at least three gels thick.",
    "Stain the gel on a side or horizontal shaker at 25°C. The staining time at 25°C should be 10–30 min.\nDiscard the staining solution until clear target protein bands appear.\nAdd an appropriate amount of deionized water, wash off the residual staining solution, stop the staining reaction.\nTake pictures and record the results.\nElute the gel (This step can be performed if a background-free picture of the gel is desired).\nAdd about 100 mL of deionized water, shake the gel on a shaker to decolorize.\nEvery 5–15 min, carefully pour off the liquid, add 100 mL of deionized water, and continue to decolorize on the shaker. Usually, de-staining for 30–120 min can highly reduce the background staining. See also troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.13], 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.15].\nAfter Coomassie brilliant blue staining and elution, the PARP1 band was cut, decolorized and subjected to mass spectrometry (MS).\nNote: The area of the cleaved band should be less than or equal to 1 cm × 1 cm (the maximum area does not exceed 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm), the target band should be clear, clearly visible to naked eyes, and there are no excess bands in the remaining molecular weight range; the cleaved band should be located in separating gel rather than concentrating gel; store in a 1.5 mL tube and keep the isolated gel moist by adding a small amount of deionized water.",
    "Note: If the gel concentration is relatively low and the gel is prone to be damaged due to heating, you can put the gel after electrophoresis into a container of appropriate size, add 100 mL of deionized water so that the gel is completely covered with water. Shake and wash the gel on a rotator for a total of 5 min. Washing 3–5 times can also achieve the effect of removing contaminants such as SDS in the gel. If you want to speed up the washing, you can add 100 mL of boiled deionized water, shake it on a shaker for 5 min, and wash 2–3 times in total. The purpose of microwave heating or washing with heated deionized water is to speed up the washing process and shorten the washing time. If the time is sufficient, it can be washed at 25°C.\nUsing Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to obtain the resulting MS/MS data.\nLoad the sample onto an HPLC chromatography system named Thermo Fisher Easy-nLC 1000 equipped with a C18 column (1.8 mm, 0.15 × 100 mm).\nSolvent A contained 0.1% formic acid and solvent B contained 100% acetonitrile. The elution gradient was from 4% to 18% in 182 min, 18%–90% in 13 min solvent B at a flow rate of 300 nL/min.\nMass spectrometry analysis were carried out at the PTMBio Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) in the positive-ion mode with an automated data-dependent MS/MS analysis with full scans (350–1,600 m/z) acquired using FTMS at a mass resolution of 30,000 and the ten most intense precursor ions were selected for MS/MS.\nUse higher-energy collision dissociation to acquire the MS/MS at 35% collision energy at a mass resolution of 15,000.",
    "Tandem mass spectra were searched against human PARP1 protein sequence. Trypsin/P was specified as cleavage enzyme allowing up to 2 missing cleavages.\nMass error was set to 20 ppm for precursor ions and 0.05 Da for fragment ions.\nCarbamidomethyl on Cys were specified as fixed modification, oxidation on Met and phosphorylation on Ser, Thr, Tyr were specified as variable modifications. Peptide confidence was set at high, and peptide ion score was set > 20 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).
