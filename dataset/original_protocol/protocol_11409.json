    "The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of National Cancer Center, Korea (NCCNCS-12-630).\n1. Sample Preparation (30 min)\nFor the culture of HeLa cells (CCL-2, ATCC), use 10 mL complete DMEM medium (10% fetal bovine serum, 1% pen-strep) in a 100 mm culture dish. To prepare serum-starved HeLa cells, incubate confluent HeLa cells in DMEM without fetal bovine serum for 48 hours, as described in a previous study11.\nTo detach the cells, wash them with 2 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and add 2 mL 0.25% EDTA trypsin per 100 mm culture dish. Then, incubate for 2 - 3 min in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C.\nAdd 5 mL of complete DMEM medium to the culture dish to deactivate trypsin, and transfer the detached cells to a 15 mL tube. Then, centrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 10 min to form a pellet.\nRemove the supernatant, and wash the pellet twice with 2 mL cold PBS by centrifugation at 300 x g for 10 min.\nAfter removal of the supernatant, add 1 mL of 95% ethanol to the cell pellet, and mix the cell pellet with ethanol by vortexing. Keep the fixed cells on ice until the cell-block preparation.\n2. Cell-block Preparation (1 h 30 min)\nFor the preparation of frozen plasma aliquots, collect EDTA plasma from healthy donor blood and centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 10 min. Collect the supernatant plasma, and aliquot 200 - 400 µL each into microfuge tubes. Store the aliquots at -80 °C until use. When the frozen plasma aliquots are ready, retrieve them and thaw the plasma by incubation at 37 °C for 5 min.\nCentrifuge the fixed cells at 700 x g for 10 min, then discard the supernatant.",
    "Mix the cell pellet with 2 drops (about 200 µL) of the plasma, 2 drops of thromboplastin, and 2 drops of 0.025 M calcium chloride. Then, mix them by pipetting.\nAllow the mixture to form a cell clot at room temperature for 10 min, as shown in Figure 2A. Then, wash the cell clot with PBS two times by pouring and removing PBS by pipette. The representative white cell clot is shown in Figure 2B.\nMoisten a piece of filter paper with formalin, and wrap the cell clot with the pre-moistened filter paper. Then, place the clotted mixture with a pincette in a tissue cassette as shown in Figure 2C.\nPlace the tissue cassette in a glass jar containing 50 mL of buffered formalin (10% formalin in PBS) overnight at 4 °C for formalin fixation.\n3. Tissue Processing and Paraffin Embedding (Overnight)\nLoad the tissue cassette containing the formalin-fixed cell clot in a tissue processor overnight as described previously11. The tissue processing is for water removal and conditioning of fixed cells prior to paraffin embedding. For research without tissue processing, perform the tissue processing procedure as shown in Table 1.\nTurn on the heated embedding station, and 60 minutes later, check that there is molten paraffin in the metal mold therein (Figure 2D).\nTake the formed cell clot from the tissue cassette and place it in the molten paraffin within the metal mold.\nPlace the new tissue cassette without the lid into the metal mold containing the cell clot in the middle of the molten paraffin, and pour more molten paraffin into the tissue cassette and onto the metal mold. Then, let the paraffin solidify in the cold plate for 30 - 60 seconds.",
    "Separate the tissue cassette from the metal mold. Then, the paraffin cell block is ready for immunocytochemistry. The embedded cell clot in the paraffin-embedded cell block is indicated by the arrow in Figure 2E.\n4. Preparation of Slides for Immunocytochemistry (1 h)\nCheck the area for the cell clot in the paraffin cell block, and cut the cell block into slices with thicknesses of 3 - 4 µm using a microtome. Put the paraffin sections on silane-coated glass slides, as shown in Figure 2F.\nPlace the section slides in a 37 °C oven for 30 min to make the sections adhere to the slides.\n5. Immunocytochemistry of Cell Blocks (6 h)\nNOTE: For immunocytochemical staining on cell-block sections, various kits can be used (see Table of Materials). All such kits have various sensitivities and specificities depending on their modifications.\nIncubate the sections in 50 mL of xylene for 4 min to de-paraffinize.\nIncubate the slides in 100% ethanol for 2 min for dehydration, and two times in 95% ethanol, and in 80% ethanol for 2 min. Then, remove the ethanol in running water for 10 min.\nFor antigen retrieval, place the slides in a jar containing 40 mL Tris-EDTA retrieval buffer, pH 9.0, and boil in a cooker for 30 min.\nWash the slides under running water, and incubate them in 95% ethanol for 10 min at 4 °C. Then, mark the cell-staining area on the slides with a Pap pen for easy identification.\nWash the slides in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20 (TBS-T), and incubate in the hydrogen peroxide block (see Table of Materials) at room temperature for 15 min to remove any remnant peroxidase activity. Then, wash the slides in TBS-T three times for 2 min each.",
    "Prepare diluted antibody solution by diluting primary antibody in the protein block (see Table of Materials). For example, the CKAP2 primary antibody can be diluted 1:100, and the Ki-67 antibody 1:500. Then, incubate the slides in 100 µL of diluted antibody solution for 1 h.\nAfter washing in TBS-T five times for 2 min each, incubate the slides in the primary antibody enhancer in the kit for 15 min at room temperature in the dark.\nAfter the washing in TBS-T four times for 2 min each, add 2 drops of HRP polymer (a secondary antibody labeled with horseradish peroxidase), and incubate the slides at room temperature for 30 min.\nAfter washing in TBS-T five times for 2 min each, add 100 µL of diaminobenzidine (DAB) solution (see Table of Materials), and incubate the slides for 3 min.\nAfter washing in TBS-T two times, add 100 µL of Hematoxylin solution (the mixture of 100 µL of Hematoxylin and 600 µL of distilled water), and incubate the slides for 1 min.\nAfter washing the slides in TBS-T once, dehydrate by incubating in 95% ethanol for 2 min, dipping in 95% ethanol once, and dipping in 100% ethanol two times. Then, incubate the slides in 40 mL xylene in a glass jar for 5 min.\nWhen the slides are dry from xylene, mount the respective coverslips.\nObserve the staining patterns using light microscopy."
