    "This protocol explains how to prepare the seeding medium for neurons and thaw and seed neurons into a 1536-well plate. The iPSC-derived, GFP-labeled human neurons used here (cortical glutamatergic neurons and spinal motor neurons) are commercially available. Both cell types have high neuronal purity (>90%). Cortical glutamatergic neurons consist predominantly of excitatory neurons, whereas spinal motor neurons consist predominantly of motor neurons. We have successfully tested both neuron types in the neurite outgrowth assay described here. Users can choose the type that best suits their needs.\nThe seeding medium is prepared according to a recipe from BrainXell. It contains brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which supports neuron proliferation and survival; glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF, a disulfide-linked homodimer), which specifically promotes dopamine uptake, survival, and morphological differentiation of midbrain neurons; and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), which regulates cell proliferation, growth, differentiation, motility, and the synthesis and deposition of extracellular matrix. BDNF, GDNF, and TGF-β1 are supplied as lyophilized powders and should be reconstituted according to manufacturer's instructions. For this assay, the recommended stock concentrations are 10 μg/ml for BDNF and GDNF and 1 μg/ml for TGF-β1. All stock solutions should be stored at −20°C in aliquots to avoid freeze-thaw cycles, which could compromise the integrity of the solutions.\nMaterials\nCommon ingredients for seeding medium:\n               \nDMEM/F12 medium, no phenol red (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 11039021)\nNeurobasal medium, no phenol red (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 12348017)\nB27 supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 17504-044)\nN2 supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 17502-048)\nGeltrex (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no.

Thaw an aliquot of Geltrex (15 mg/ml) on ice and then dilute 1:10 using cold DMEM/F12 medium to give a working stock of 1.5 mg/ml.\nFor example, for a 100-μl aliquot, add 900 μl cold DMEM/F12.\n3.

    "Each vial of cells will require ∼20 ml seeding medium, so scale accordingly. The final 1× concentrations of penicillin and streptomycin are 50 U/ml and 50 µg/ml, respectively.\n4. Allow medium to equilibrate to room temperature for 15 min. Do not warm in a 37°C water bath.\nThaw neurons and prepare suspension\n5. Transfer a cryovial of neurons from liquid nitrogen to a 37°C water bath and gently move the vial within the water to increase the rate of thawing. To minimize contamination, be careful to avoid submerging the cap.\nFor multiple vials or multiple cell types, perform these steps in parallel for all cryovials.\n6. As soon as the last ice melts, remove the vial from the water bath, disinfect by spraying the vial with 70% ethanol, and transfer to the cell culture hood.\n7. Slowly add 800 μl of the appropriate seeding medium to the vial at a rate of ∼1 drop/s using a 1-ml pipette tip.\nThis should take ∼30 s.\n8. Gently transfer the entire contents (1 ml total) to a new sterile 50-ml conical tube.\n9. Gently add 1 ml of the appropriate seeding medium to the original vial to collect residual cells and transfer to the same 50-ml tube.\n10. Slowly add an additional 3 ml seeding medium to the 50-ml tube using a 10-ml serological pipette, swirling the tube gently while adding the medium.\nThis should take ∼1 min.\n11. Mix suspension completely and filter through a cell strainer to a new 50-ml conical tube.\nDetermine neuron viability\n12. Gently swirl the tube of cells, take a 10-μl aliquot, and mix with an equal volume of 0.4% trypan blue in a small plastic tube. Incubate ∼3 min at room temperature.",
    "13. Apply a drop of trypan blue/cell mixture to a hemacytometer and count unstained (viable) and stained (nonviable) cells separately.\n14. Determine the density of viable cells (Dv in cells/ml) by multiplying the total number of viable cells by 2 (the dilution factor in trypan blue).\n15. Determine the density of total cells (Dt in cells/ml) by adding the number of viable and nonviable cells and multiplying by 2.\n16. Calculate the percentage of viable cells as % viable cells = Dv/Dt × 100.\nThe percentage of viable cells should be >80% for a good experimental result.\nSeed neurons\n17. Transfer the required number of cells to a new 50-ml conical tube and then bring the viable cell density to 1.2–1.6 × 105 cells/ml by adding the appropriate volume of seeding medium.\nUsers will need to optimize the seeding density based on their experimental setting. We recommend 600-800 viable cells/well for a 1536-well plate, 2000-2500 viable cells/well for a 384-well plate, and 10,000 viable cells/well for a 96-well plate.\n18. Dispense 5 μl cell suspension (600-800 cells) to each well of a PDL-coated 1536-well plate using a multi-drop Combi Dispenser or BioRAPTR.\n19. Without moving the plate, cover it with a stainless steel lid and leave on the bench at room temperature for 15 min to allow the cells to attach.\nThe plate should not be moved or agitated during seeding, as this may lead to uneven attachment. Similarly, it should also not be moved immediately to the incubator to avoid disturbance.\n20. After 15 min, observe the cells under a microscope to check cell density and distribution.\n21. Gently transfer the assay plate to a 37°C humidified incubator with 5% CO2 and incubate 40-42 hr to allow neurite formation. Check daily under a microscope for neurite formation.",
    "In addition to the seeded assay plate prepared in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.542#cpz1542-prot-0001], two additional 1536-well plates are needed: one for control compounds and one for test compounds. The control plate contains both a known positive control and a negative control, which are used to normalize the test compound data. Here, we use the neurotoxicant rotenone as a positive control for inhibition of neurite outgrowth. In the plate layout shown in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.542#cpz1542-fig-0002], rotenone is plated as a serial dilution (column 1) and as 16 replicates of three different concentrations (columns 2-3). The serial dilution can be used to calculate the IC50, which can be used to compare reproducibility for the assay plate. When we perform data analysis, we commonly use the maximum inhibition value of rotenone to normalize the data. By using three different concentrations in 16 replicates, we can pick the highest inhibition value to normalize the data. In addition to rotenone, we use tetraoctylammonium bromide as a positive control for cytotoxicity. As a negative control, we use DMSO (vehicle). For the test compound plate, compounds are diluted in DMSO and placed in columns 5-48. The final DMSO concentration in the wells is generally less than 0.5%, which has no toxic effect on the cells. Screening large numbers of test compounds may require multiple plates, but only a single control plate is needed. This is why control and test compounds are plated separately\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/86473e90-7ab7-4dff-92d9-b0809a4e13a0/cpz1542-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2",
    "Example plate map for control compounds in 1536-well format. Column 1: Duplicate 16-concentration titration of positive control rotenone (yellow, final 46 μM to 1.4 nM). Column 2 and top of column 3: 16 replicates for each final rotenone concentration (purple, 46 μM; pink, 23 μM; green, 11.5 μM). Bottom of column 3: tetraoctylammonium bromide (brown, final 92 μM) as positive control for cytotoxicity. Column 4: DMSO (blue) as negative control. Test compounds in columns 5-48 (gray) are in a different plate.\nFor compound treatment, 23 nl of each control and test compound is transferred to the assay plate using the PinTool workstation. This protocol describes how to prepare the control plate and transfer both control and test compounds to the assay plate containing cells. The control plate can be prepared as soon as the assay plate containing neurons is placed in the incubator (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.542#cpz1542-prot-0001]).\nNOTE: This protocol can be adapted to treat neurons in a 96- or 384-well assay plate, but it is then critical to dilute compounds in medium or PBS instead of DMSO to avoid the effect of high DMSO concentrations on the neurons. The amount of compounds transferred to a 1536-well plate (23 nl) contains little enough DMSO to be ignored. For a 96- or 384-well format, the volume transferred is increased to 10 µl/well, significantly increasing the amount of DMSO.\nMaterials\nRotenone (Sigma, cat. no.

Dissolve positive control compounds (rotenone, tetraoctylammonium bromide) individually in DMSO (or the appropriate solvent) to make 10 mM stock solutions.\nStock solutions can be stored up to 6 months at −20°C for future use.\n2. Prepare a 1:2 serial dilution of rotenone in the first two columns of a 96-well plate (16 wells), starting with 10 mM and ending at 305 nM (16 concentrations, 200 µl volume each). Use a multichannel pipetter to transfer the dilutions to the first column of a 384-well plate.\n3. Add any other controls to the 384-well plate. In our example, this would be one column (16 wells) each for:\nThree concentrations of rotenone (10, 5, and 2.5 mM)\nTetraoctylammonium bromide (20 mM)\nDMSO\n4. Use a multichannel pipettor or automated multichannel pipetting system to transfer 5 µl/well from the 384-well plate to rows 1-4 of a 1536-well plate as shown in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.542#cpz1542-fig-0002].\n5. Prepare the test compound plate by adding 5 µl/well of the desired compounds and dilutions to rows 5-48 of a second 1536-well plate.\nWe recommend using multiple dilutions of test compound so the IC50 can be calculated after the test. We commonly start with 100 µM (final concentration in the assay well) as the highest concentration.\n6. Centrifuge both 1536-well plates for 10 s at 1000 rpm, room temperature, and seal with film for later use.\nTransfer compounds to assay plate\n7. After the seeded assay plate has incubated 40-42 hr, check neurite formation under a microscope.\n8. Remove the assay plate lid and place the plate inside the PinTool workstation along with the control and test compound plates.",
    "9. Use the PinTool workstation to transfer 23 nl from each well of the compound plates to the assay plate.\nTo avoid cross contamination, it is important to wash pins with appropriate reagents (e.g., DMSO and methanol) before and after each use.\n10.

    "High-throughput imaging enables visualization and quantification by capturing many cellular features on a large scale using automated microscopy and image analysis platforms. High-content screening, or automated microscope-based screening, is one such approach that combines multiparametric microscopy with quantitation of a large dataset of morphological features. Measuring the length of neurite outgrowth can be done using an HCI platform to visually examine cells in a time-dependent manner (Li & Xia, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.542#cpz1542-bib-0010]). Here, we describe how to measure neurite outgrowth and analyze the imaging data using the Operetta CLS High Content Analysis System. Images are taken from each well, and then the platform's image analysis software (here, Harmony 4.6) is used to convert the images into numerical data for comparison between treatment and controls. This protocol also describes how to analyze the data generated to extract the relevant information regarding the effect of test chemicals on neurite outgrowth.\nMaterials\nTreated assay plate (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.542#cpz1542-prot-0002])\nSterile breathable microporous sealing film (USA Scientific, cat. no. 2920-1010)\nOperetta CLS High Content Analysis System (PerkinElmer, cat. no.

Remove assay plate from the incubator and replace the lid with a sterilize breathable adhesive film.\nUsing a sterilized breathable adhesive film helps to maintain neuron viability during imaging and keep plates usable for imaging at the later time (e.g., for a time course experiment).\n3. Clean the bottom of the plate with fine paper towel to keep particles from interfering with imaging, and place the plate onto the plate holder. Click the “Load” button on the Harmony screen to load the plate into the system.\n4. Under “Setup”, select the following parameters:\n         \ntable:\n﻿0,1",

    "To evaluate compound cytotoxicity, a cytotoxicity test such as Calcein Red AM (AAT Bioquest; Li et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.542#cpz1542-bib-0011]) can be done at the end of the experiment.\nAnalyze images\n9.
