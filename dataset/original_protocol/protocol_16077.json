    "Adeno associated viruses (AAVs) are small, nonpathogenic DNA viruses with a 4.7-kb single-stranded genome belonging to the Dependoviruses. The wild-type AAV genome consists of open reading frames for rep, cap, and aap, flanked by two inverted terminal repeats (ITRs). The rep gene codes for four nonstructural proteins (Rep78, Rep68, Rep52, and Rep40) involved in ITR-dependent viral replication, transcription, site-specific integration, and AAV genome encapsidation (Kotterman, Chalberg, & Schaffer, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpns.103#cpns103-bib-0012]). The cap gene codes for three capsid proteins (VP1, VP2, and VP3) that are assembled in a 1:1:10 molar ratio (Govindasamy et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpns.103#cpns103-bib-0008]), and aap is involved in the assembly process. AAVs are not linked to any human diseases. They can infect both dividing and nondividing cells, and the viral genome persists episomally, with minimal integration events into the host chromosome (Kotterman et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpns.103#cpns103-bib-0012]; Wu, Asokan, & Samulski, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpns.103#cpns103-bib-0022]).",
    "In order to use AAVs as gene expression vehicles, they have been rendered replication deficient by several modifications. Recombinant AAVs (rAAVs) are generated by replacing the rep and cap genes with a transgenic cassette. While the flanking ITR sequences that contain cis-acting elements required for vector genome packaging into AAV capsids remain intact, the excised rep and cap genes are provided in trans, either together with an AAV helper plasmid or delivered as separate entities. To date, there are 12 different serotypes described (AAV1 through AAV12; Vance, Mitchell, & Samulski, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpns.103#cpns103-bib-0021]). Many serotypes use different receptors for infection. For example, AAV2 primarily uses heparin sulfate proteoglycan, AAV5 binds to N-linked sialic acid, and AAV9 binds to N-linked galactose. The different serotypes also have diverse transduction abilities. AAV1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 exhibit high affinity for central nervous system tissue, whereas AAV4 efficiently transduces the eye, and AAV1, 6, and 9 can also infect heart and skeletal muscle (Vance et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpns.103#cpns103-bib-0021]). Even though AAV can efficiently transduce a wide array of tissues and cell types, huge efforts are being put in to generating new and improved viral capsids (Davidsson et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpns.103#cpns103-bib-0005]; Deverman et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpns.103#cpns103-bib-0006]; Ojala et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpns.103#cpns103-bib-0017]). Another way to improve transduction efficiency regardless of serotype used was the development of self-complementary AAVs (scAAV; McCarty, Monahan, & Samulski, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpns.103#cpns103-bib-0014]). scAAVs are double stranded (contrary to wild-type AAVs that carry a single-stranded genome) and can therefore circumvent the rate-limiting step of DNA replication upon infection. Studies have shown a 5- to 140-fold increase in infectivity using scAAVs compared with ssAAVs. However, increase in transduction of the double-stranded scAAVs is gained at the expense of a halved loading capacity of 2.4 kb (McCarty et al., 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpns.103#cpns103-bib-0014]). There are numerous ways to produce and purify AAVs.",
    "Production is often carried out in HEK293T cells (Salganik, Hirsch, & Samulski, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpns.103#cpns103-bib-0018]), but it can also be done in the baculovirus expression system using an insect cell line such as Sf9 (Kohlbrenner et al., 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpns.103#cpns103-bib-0011]; Ni, Zhou, McCarty, Zolotukhin, & Muzyczka, 1994[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpns.103#cpns103-bib-0015]). The latter has been especially interesting for clinical applications as the use of mammalian products for good manufacturing practice application always bears the risk of introducing xenogeneic disease.",
    "Transfection of viral plasmids into producer cells are most often done using calcium chloride (resulting in a calcium phosphate precipitate; Graham & van der Eb, 1973[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpns.103#cpns103-bib-0009]) by using polyethylenimine (PEI; Boussif et al., 1995[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpns.103#cpns103-bib-0004]) or lipofection (Felgner et al., 1987[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpns.103#cpns103-bib-0007]). For preclinical applications, AAVs have traditionally been purified using cesium chloride (Bachrach & Friedmann, 1971[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpns.103#cpns103-bib-0003]), iodixanol gradients (Strobel, Miller, Rist, & Lamla, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpns.103#cpns103-bib-0020]; Zolotukhin et al., 1999[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpns.103#cpns103-bib-0023]), or, as described in this protocol, chloroform precipitation (Davidsson et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpns.103#cpns103-bib-0005]). We have used the protocol described here in a previous study, expressing transgenes both in vitro and in vivo (Davidsson et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpns.103#cpns103-bib-0005]). The main advantages of the current protocol over existing ones are the timescale for purification of the AAV vector (5 to 6 hr vs 15 to 16 hr) and the lack of specialized equipment that is needed for the iodixanol precipitation protocol (e.g., ultracentrifuge, special pumps).\nHere we present a detailed protocol for the fast and efficient production of AAV vectors (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpns.103#cpns103-fig-0001]), with a titer yield comparable with that of the gold-standard iodixanol gradient–based protocols. This protocol has a workflow that can be performed in any molecular biology laboratory using standard laboratory equipment. The outlined protocol contains detailed information for cell culture, transfection, cell harvesting, and AAV purification.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b08871fe-d233-4f8c-8114-5a4d6d0a1b92/cpns103-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nTimeline of AAV production with key steps and an estimated amount of time for the process.\nBefore starting to produce AAV vectors, the necessary safety and regulatory documents and standard operating procedures have to be established according to national and local guidelines.\nThis protocol describes the complete process of AAV purification from triple-transfected HEK293T cells. All reagents and consumables used during AAV production should be kept sterile, and sterile technique should be applied throughout the production protocol.",

However, for best result, monitor confluency. Only proceed with the next step once confluence reaches 75% to 80%, as described above (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpns.103#cpns103-fig-0002]).\nFor best result, use HEK293T with as low passage number as possible. Thaw new cells on a regular basis (see Critical Parameters).\nTransfection\n13. For the three-plasmid transfection system, prepare a 1:1:1 molar ratio for all plasmids (calculations per 175-cm2 flask):\n         \n17.7 μg pHelper (HGT1) (17,800 bp)\n7.9 μg rep/cap (8000 bp)\n5.9 μg transgene (6000 bp)",

Immediately place in glass vial (or sigma-coated plastic tube), and ensure the glass vial is properly sealed. To avoid evaporation, seal vials or tubes with Parafilm.\n57. Store AAV at 4°C 6 months.\nTitration of AAV\nTitration of AAV can be carried out in multiple ways and lies outside the scope of this protocol. The most commonly used methods are quantitative PCR (qPCR; Aurnhammer et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpns.103#cpns103-bib-0002]) or droplet digital PCR (ddPCR; Lock, Alvira, Chen, & Wilson, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpns.103#cpns103-bib-0013]). The main difference between these methods is that qPCR uses a standard curve based on plasmid dilutions to assess viral titer, whereas ddPCR gives an absolute count of viral particles. Comparisons have been made between the two methods, and both methods give satisfactory results (Sanmiguel, Gao, & Vandenberghe, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpns.103#cpns103-bib-0019])."
