    "The mazes (Vsoc-maze and three-chamber apparatus) were used in a sound-attenuated room with dim illumination 4-7 lux. A digital camera on top of the maze was used to record the sessions. On-line image in a contiguous room was available to the observer through a close-circuit camera situated on top of the maze. All three phases of the social test (habituation, sociability and preference for social novelty) were performed consecutively (Figure 2). Vsoc-maze phases lasted 5 min as it has been described that during the first five minutes of interaction the majority of the social behaviors take place (Nadler et al., 2004). The sessions in the three-chamber apparatus usually lasts 10 min (Kaidanovich-Beilin et al., 2011). For comparison purpose, exploratory behavior in the three-chamber apparatus was computed at 5 min (Figure 3) and 10 min (Figure 4).  All mice were housed four per cage and maintained in standard environment conditions of temperature (21 °C ± 1 °C) and humidity (55% ± 10%) with food and water ad libitum. All the experiments were performed during the light phase of the dark/light cycle (lights on at 8 a.m. and off at 8 p.m.). Before starting the experiment, mice were habituated in the experimental room and handled for 1 week.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191011/20191011010030_8424.jpgFigure 2. Scheme of the sociability and preference for social novelty test (Martínez-Navarro et al., 2019). There are three different phases: Phase I (habituation), Phase II (sociability) and Phase III (preference for social novelty). Each phase lasts 5 min. During this time the exploration of the experimental mouse towards the chambers at the end of the corridors was recorded on the three phases: both chambers empty (Phase I), stranger-1 (STR 1) vs. empty chamber (Phase II) and stranger-1 (STR 1) vs. stranger-2 (STR 2) (Phase III).",
    "Habituation session (Phase I)The habituation session allows mice to freely explore and familiarize with the Vsoc-maze.To record the whole experiment, turn on the video recording system.Place the experimental mouse by lifting the Vsoc-maze, with the chambers empty, at the starting point (crossing-point between both arms). Let the experimental mouse explore the maze for 5 min.During this time, use two stopwatches and assign each stopwatch to count the exploration time of each chamber. Then, measure the exploration time for each chamber through the image obtained by the closed-circuit camera.At the end of the session, record the time exploring each empty chamber.Notes: It is not necessary to turn off the video recording and/or the data acquisition system. There is no need to move the experimental mouse from the Vsoc-maze. Although in our experience it would not be necessary, an inter-trial period could be included in which the experimental mouse is removed from the Vsoc-maze after habituation. During the inter-trial period the stranger 1 (STR 1) is placed in the chamber (see Sociability session, Phase II). Performing this inter-trial period may avoid experimenter’s manipulation of the maze while the experimental mouse is inside the Vsoc-maze. Moreover, it would allow cleaning any urine or defecation in the Vsoc-maze which may affect the exploratory behavior of the experimental mouse during the next Phases of the procedure.Sociability session (Phase II)The sociability session is performed just after the habituation session.A juvenile mouse assigned as (STR 1) is placed in one of the small chambers located at the end of one of the corridors (both corridors were alternated during the experiments). The mouse is placed in the chamber from the top of the maze, before placing the lid of the chamber. The sociability session lasts 5 min.",
    "Use the stopwatches to count the time that the experimental mouse spends exploring each chamber. A preference for spending more time exploring the chamber with the STR 1 than the empty chamber should be obvious. This juvenile mouse was used as STR 1 for all the experiment.At the end of the sociability session, record the exploration times for both chambers. Maintain the experimental mouse and STR 1 in the Vsoc-maze and start the last phase of the test.Notes: An inter-trial period between Phase II and III could be included, where the experimental mouse is removed from the Vsoc-maze. Alternatively, the STR 1 may be changed to the previously empty chamber before introducing STR 2 in the chamber previously occupied by STR 1. Under these conditions the experimenter can be confident that the exploration time devoted to STR 1 and STR 2 in the next Phase is due to a social novelty preference rather than spatial novelty (new STR 2 in previously empty chamber). Additionally, Phase II may be extended beyond 5 min in the case that social habituation-dishabituation behavior may be studied. Experimental mice may reduce the interest for exploring STR 1 as the Phase II progresses, as shown elsewhere (Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014). By running Phase II for longer, a decay in exploration as a function of session time can be revealed.  Preference for social novelty session (Phase III)The preference for social novelty session is performed just after the sociability session.The test session lasts 5 min.A second novel mouse assigned as stranger 2 (STR 2) is placed from the top inside the previously empty chamber, while the STR 1 remains inside the same chamber. During test time the experimental mouse is allowed to explore all the apparatus. This juvenile mouse was used as STR 2 for all the experiment.",
    "Use the stopwatches to count the time that the experimental mouse spends exploring each chamber. A preference for spending more time exploring the chamber with the STR 2, which is the novel mouse, than the STR 1, the familiar mouse should be obvious.Post-test cleaning sessionRemove the experimental mouse and the stranger mice from the apparatus by lifting the whole maze, and return mice to their home cage. Clean the maze with 30% (vol/vol) ethanol to avoid olfactory cues.Do the test with another animal if it is necessary (back to step 2 in Habituation session [Phase I]).When the data acquisition for the Whole experiment is finished, export the experimental data and analyze the results (see Data analysis).Note: We compared the exploration times in both settings, the Vsoc-maze and the three-chamber apparatus, using an inbreed and an outbreed mouse strain (C57BL/6J and CD1 mice, respectively). In order to compare time efficiency between mazes, both strains were analyzed for 5 min in the Vsoc-maze (Figure 3) and for 5 min (Figure 3) and 10 min (Figure 4) in the three-chamber maze. The Vsoc-maze setting provided quite similar results in the habituation session (Phase I) for both strains (Figures 3A and 3B). These results were variable for CD1 mice in the three-chamber maze (Figure 3B). In the sociability phase (Phase II), both mouse strains demonstrated a significant preference (P < 0.001) for the chamber containing the juvenile STR 1 compared to the empty chamber. Such preference was evident in the 5 min period in both mazes (Figures 3C and 3D) and in the 10 min for the three-chamber apparatus (Figure 4). Finally, on the 5 min session to assess preference for social novelty (Phase III), only mice analyzed in the Vsoc-maze, independent of their strain, showed a significant predilection (P < 0.",
    "001) for exploring the new-unfamiliar juvenile mouse (STR 2) compared to the now-familiar mouse (STR 1) (Figures 3E and 3F and Figure 4). C57BL/6J mice took longer to show a clear preference for social novelty in the three-chamber maze since such preference was only apparent after 10 min (Figure 3E and Figure 4A). Alternatively results can be represented using a social index (Figure 5). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191011/20191011010057_2374.jpgFigure 3.
