    "The study is approved by the ethics committee of the University of Queensland, Queensland, Australia and informed consent has been obtained from all subjects included in the study.\n1. Subjects\nRecruit volunteer subjects over 18 years of age internally at the University of Queensland.\nInformed consent\n\t\nInform each subject about potential risks of undergoing the examination before entering the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) safety zone. Specifically, discuss the ultra-high magnetic field exposure and possible contraindications for undergoing an MRI examination. Inform the subject that participating in the examination is voluntary and that at all times he/she may abort the examination. Obtain informed consent in writing.\nExplain the procedure to the participant. Since imaging is performed during breath hold at end expiration and consistent breath holding is integral to image quality, coach the subject on breathing technique prior to scanning.\nPerform MR safety screening on all subjects before entering the MRI safety zone in writing and again before entering the scanner room. Exclude subjects with contraindications for undergoing an MRI examination (e.g., pacemakers, implanted defibrillators, other unsafe medical implants or claustrophobia).\nAsk the subject to change into scrubs before entering the scanner room.\n2. Preparation",
    "Set up the additional hardware required to operate the dedicated 32 channel 1H cardiac transceiver (Tx/Rx) RF coil26 on the patient table as outlined in Figure 1a and b. Apart from a small power splitter box (Figure 1c), the auxiliary coil equipment comprises one power splitter box and phase shifter box (Figure 1d) and one Tx/Rx interface box (Figure 1e) for each of the two RF coil sections that will be placed below and on top of the subject. The greater part it accommodates the local transmit electronics, which is required for signal excitation at 7 Tesla, since traditional birdcage body coils as commonly employed at 1.5 T and 3.0 T are not available.\nPlace the additional RF coil hardware at the top end of the patient table as outlined in Figure 1b and link the individual boxes together with the Bayonet Neill-Concelman (BNC) cables. Since the distance that the patient table can be driven into the MRI bore is limited, ensure to leave sufficient space on the patient table for the coil infrastructure to guarantee that the subject's heart can be positioned with the center of the coil at the isocenter of the magnet.\nConnect the Tx/Rx interface boxes to the four coil plugs on the patient table.",
    "Place the center of the posterior coil array 147 cm away from top end of the patient table (Figure 1b). This spot defines where the posterior coil array has to be placed to ensure that the subject's heart is at the isocenter of the magnet if the patient table is maximally driven into the bore. The placement on the predefined coil spot is crucial, to ensure optimal operation. Determine the optimal position of the posterior coil array as well as the positioning of the auxiliary equipment in preliminary tests including several volunteers of different body height.\nConnect the four cables of the posterior coil array into the appropriate sockets of the Tx/Rx interface box for the posterior array.\nConnect the four modules of the anterior coil array are with the Tx/Rx interface box for the top array and flip the array over the auxiliary coil equipment to allow for subject positioning.\nAttach the three ECG electrodes to the body of the subject. Follow the vendor guidelines for electrode placement to ensure optimal operation of the system's trigger algorithm.\nPosition the subject on the patient table (Figure 1f). Critically, make sure that the subject's heart is positioned central to the posterior coil in order to guarantee scanning within the isocenter of the magnet. As, depending on the subject's height, the head will have to be placed on top of the coil/interface box connectors, place the cables carefully and use appropriate cushioning to ensure the subject's comfort and compliance.\nConnect the trigger device to the ECG electrodes.\nAttach the pulse trigger device to the subject's index finger. Use this second device for triggering in the event of severe distortions of the ECG signal introduced by the MHD effect.\nHand the safety squeeze ball to the subjects.",
    "Equip the subject with headphones and earbuds to reduce the noise exposure and to allow communication with the subject.\nPlace the anterior coil on the subject's chest, such that the cables that connect to the plugs E-F and G-H are located to the right and left of the subject's head, respectively.\nDrive the subject into the scanner bore. Perform the driving operation manually and ensure that the speed button of the table controls is in the off-position to guarantee the subject's safety during the driving process. Do not use the automatic mode as the variable table speed in this mode is optimized for neuro imaging and the distance the table can be driven automatically into the bore is limited by the scanner hardware.\nCheck if communication to the subject through the intercom is possible and if the subject is feeling well.\nMR imaging\n\t\nRun basic localizer (scout) scans along the three physical gradient axes for slice planning and B0-shimming.\nUse an ECG-triggered fast low angle shot (FLASH) sequence with the following acquisition parameters: field of view (FOV) = 400 mm, matrix = 192 x 144, slices per gradient axis = 1, thickness = 8 mm, echo time (TE) = 1.24, repetition time (TR) = 298 ms, flip angle = 10째.\nApply parallel MRI with acceleration factor = 2, reference lines = 24 and generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions (GRAPPA) reconstruction.\nUse the localizer images to verify that the subject's heart is positioned in the isocenter of the magnet. Reposition the subject if necessary.\n3rd order B0-shimming\n\t\nOpen the 3rd order shim tool (Figure 2a) and reset all 3rd order shim currents (Figure 2b).\nPrescribe the shim volume for proper shimming over a region covering the heart (Figure 2c).",
    "Run a non-triggered advanced flow compensated 2D multi-echo FLASH shim sequence for the calculation of the 3rd order shim currents. Use the following parameters: FOV = 400 x 400 mm, matrix = 80 x 80, slices = 64, thickness = 5.0 mm, TE1 = 3.06, TE2 = 5.10, TR = 7 ms, flip angle = 20 째, parallel MRI (GRAPPA), acceleration factor = 2, reference lines = 24.\nTo calculate and apply the 3rd order shim currents, open the next protocol and copy the above-mentioned shim volume. Execute the SetShim program in the start menu (Figure 2a). Next, open the Manual Adjustments window in the Options menu (Figure 2d). In the 3D Shim tab, click Calculate | Apply to set the shim currents for the 2nd order (Figure 2e). Finally, set the shim currents by clicking Set Shim_3rd in the 3rd order shim tool (Figure 2b).\nClose the Manual Adjustments window. Keep the shim volume and the shim currents fixed throughout the remainder of the examination. Note that the shimming procedure can be highly system specific.\nAcquire further localizers to support double-oblique slice planning. Unless stated otherwise, use a breath held and ECG-triggered 2D FLASH sequence with the following parameters for all localizer measurements: FOV = 360 x 290 mm, matrix = 256 x 206, thickness = 6.0 mm, TE = 1.57, TR = 3.9 ms, flip angle = 35 째, parallel MRI (GRAPPA), acceleration factor: 2, reference lines: 24. Advise the patient to hold the breath in expiration. Employ high flip angles or use a segmented cine protocol (see below) to achieve improved contrast.\n\t\nAcquire the 2 chamber localizer (1 slice), planned perpendicular on the axial scout parallel to the septal wall (Figure 3a).",
    "Acquire the 4 chamber localizer (1 slice), planned perpendicular on the 2 chamber localizer slice through the mitral valve and the apex of the left ventricle (Figure 3b).\nAcquire the short axis localizer (7 slices, FOV = 360 x 330 mm), planned perpendicular on the 4 chamber localizer parallel to the mitral valve and perpendicular to the septal wall (Figure 3c).\nPerform the CINE acquisitions. Use a high resolution breath held ECG-triggered segmented 2D FLASH sequence with the following parameters: FOV = 360 x 270 mm, matrix = 256 x 192/264 x 352, thickness = 4.0 mm, TE = 3.14, TR = 6.3 ms, flip angle = 35-55 째, segments = 7, parallel MRI (GRAPPA), acceleration factor = 2/3, temporal resolution = 42.6/44.3 ms.\n\t\nStart with the left ventricular 4 chamber view (horizontal long axis, HLA) slices. Plan the central slice through the center of the mitral and tricuspid valves and the apex of the left ventricle (Figure 3d). Acquire each slice within an individual breath hold in expiration.\nNext, acquire the left ventricular short axis slices. Plan them perpendicular to the HLA and parallel to the mitral valve so that it covers the whole left ventricle from the base to the apex (Figure 3e). To ensure accurate function testing, position the first slice accurately at the mitral valve leaflet insertions, so that the center of the slice is within the ventricle. Again, acquire each slice within an individual breath hold in expiration.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
