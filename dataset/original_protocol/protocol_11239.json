    "The current study (NCT00852111) was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Participants enrolled in this study were 18 years of age or older, diagnosed with non-metastatic prostate cancer with or without prior prostatectomy, and scheduled to receive external beam radiation therapy at the Radiation Oncology Clinic of the NIH Clinical Center. Potential participants were excluded if they had a progressive disease that could cause significant fatigue, had psychiatric disease within the past five years, had uncorrected hypothyroidism or anemia, or had a second malignancy. Individuals who used sedatives, steroids, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents were also excluded. All participants were recruited at the Magnuson Clinical Research Center at the NIH. Signed written informed consents were obtained prior to study participation.\n1. Handgrip preparation and testing position\nIn a quiet room, set up a chair with armrests.\nTurn on the handheld dynamometer.\n\t\nThe software will prompt calibration of the dynamometer. Ensure the device is resting on a flat surface during calibration.\nSeat the subject in an upright position with their feet in full contact with the floor and hips as far back as the chair supports.\n\t\nEnsure the subject's hip and knee angles are close to 90° and shoulders are in neutral abduction/adduction and neutrally rotated. Ensure the subject's elbow is flexed at 90° and the wrist is unsupported, as recommended by the American Society of Hand Therapists handbook17.\nAfter calibrating the dynamometer, instruct the subject to grasp the dynamometer, with the dorsal intermediate phalanges facing forward.\n\t\nAdjust the grip position to the subject's hand size and record it7.\nMaintain the same handgrip testing position for all subsequent tests.\nPrior to each test, provide standardized scripts and ask subjects to perform a mock attempt to demonstrate understanding of the instructions.",
    "Inform the subjects that discomfort is normal, but the tests can be discontinued in the presence of unexpectedly severe strain/pain.\nStop the test if severe discomfort is reported by the patient or in the event of unexpected circumstances.\nEnsure a 2 min rest period between trials to allow the muscle to recover18.\n2. Maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) test\nProvide subjects with standardized instructions. For example, \"in the test, you will squeeze as hard as you can for 5 s, starting with your non-dominant hand. This test will be done three times for each hand. For each test, I will count down 3, 2, 1...GO. Squeeze the device on GO as hard as you can.\"\nOn \"Go\", start the program by clicking on the GO button.\nRepeat the MVIC test for a total of three times with a 30 s rest between trials.\nThe average for each hand from the three trials maximum force is the MVIC19.\n3. Maximum force static fatigue test\nInstruct subjects to exert full effort to achieve maximal contraction during the static fatigue test.\nOn \"Go\", start the program by clicking on the GO button. Use standardized encouragement script such as squeeze hard repeatedly until the test ends.\nContinue the static fatigue test for 35 s, so as to provide up to 5 s to achieve Fmax (maximal handgrip strength).\nStatic fatigue index (SFI)12,20,21\nCalculate SFI using the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60814/60814equ01.jpg\nCalculate AUCexpt by computing the experimental area under the curve from the time that Fmax was achieved (Tmax) to 30 s after Tmax.\nCalculate the hypothetical AUC (AUChypothetical) in the absence of fatigue by multiplying the Fmax by 30 s.\n\t\tNOTE: Higher SFI values indicate increased divergence from the expected value, hence higher fatigue.",
    "Calculate SFI version 2 as the ratio of the maximal force during the last 5 s (Fmax 25-30s) to the maximal force in the first 5 seconds (Fmax 0-5s) using the equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60814/60814equ02.jpg\n\t\tNOTE: Higher values of SFI indicate higher fatigue.\n4. Sub-maximum force static fatigue test\nIndicate the value of 50% of the MVIC of the participant's non-dominant hand by drawing a horizontal line on a transparency overlay of the screen.\nDraw a second line on the overlay in a different color to indicate a 10% decline of the target value.\nEnsure the participant can easily see the screen and 50% MVIC line.\nInstruct the subject to maintain a target value of 50% of MVIC for as long as possible.\nCount down. On \"Go\", start the program by clicking on the GO button.\nStop the test when the strength declines by 10% of the target value for more than 5 s as indicated by the second line on the transparency.\nCalculate total work performed7 as the force-versus-time area under the curve over the period of time during which the target force (T50% MVIC) is sustained:\n\tTotal work = AUC during T50% MVIC\n NOTE: Endurance can be measured as time to task completion22. Higher values of total work indicate lower fatigue.\n5. Dynamic fatigue test\nInstruct subjects to perform a maximal squeeze every second for a duration of 30 s. Use a metronome to provide rhythm guidance20.\nStart the metronome which is set at 1 beep per second.\nStart the countdown. On \"Go\", start the test by clicking on the GO button. Ensure the countdown matches the rate of the metronome.\nInform the participant when passing the halfway point and when 5 s are remaining.\nStop test after the 30 s are completed.\nDynamic Fatigue Index",
    "Calculate the Dynamic Fatigue Index20 using the maximal force (Fmax) of the last 5 s and the Fmax of the first 5 s.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60814/60814equ04.jpg\n\t\tNOTE: Higher values of the dynamic fatigue index (DFI) indicate higher fatigue.\nSubscription Required.
