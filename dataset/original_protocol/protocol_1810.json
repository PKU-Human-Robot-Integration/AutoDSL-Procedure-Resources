    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSlide assembly\nTiming: ∼1 h\nIn this step, the single-molecule slide is assembled by attaching the coverslip and slide with epoxy. Lanes for each reaction are delineated with double-sided tape. For flow experiments, epoxy molds and buffer reservoirs are added for automated flow of solutions. Please see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] for a visual walkthrough of how to assemble TIRF slides.\nAssemble the slide\nWarm the slide to 20°C–25°C for ∼10 min.\nCarefully remove the slide from the conical vial and place the PEGylated side face-up on a glass plate or other sterile surface.\nRemove the coverslip and use a fine-tip sharpie to mark the non-PEGylated side of the coverslip. Place the coverslip back in the 50 mL conical vial for safekeeping.\nNote: If it is unclear which side of the slide is PEGylated, one can gently pipet distilled water onto each side of the slide. The PEGylated side will have less surface tension and the water will move around more easily when the slide is tilted. The water can then be dried with a nitrogen gas stream.\nTear off a ∼10-cm-long piece of double-sided tape. Use a clean razor blade to slice the tape into ∼1 mm × 10 cm-long strips. The strips can then be cut down the middle for ∼10–12 1 mm × 5 cm strips.\nLift the tape strip from the sterile surface and gently apply one strip to the slide surface between each pair of drilled holes and along the outer edge of the first and final pair of holes.\nRemove the coverslip and lower it onto the taped slide.\nThe PEGylated side of the coverslip and the slide should be facing each other.",
    "Seal the slide and coverslip by gently pressing with a 1000-μL pipet tip and/or the blunt edge of a razor blade.\nCut the excess tape on each end of the slide using a razor blade.\nSeal the outer edges of the slide and coverslip by applying quick-drying epoxy with a 200-μL pipet tip.\nCritical: Be careful not to apply too much epoxy or it will flow too far into the lane via capillary action and “plug” a lane.\nAllow the epoxy to dry for 5–10 min, then return the slide to the 50 mL conical vial until use in the experiment.\nFlow slide preparation (optional for methods 1 and 2, required for methods 3 and 4)\nFor each lane, cut and save the upper 1 cm of a 200-μL pipet tip to make a buffer reservoir that will be attached to the top of the slide.\nUse epoxy to attach the buffer reservoir around each of the drilled holes at the top of the slide.\nNote: Pipet tips (10 μL) can be inserted into each of the holes to prevent epoxy from sealing the lane.\nInsert 10-μL pipet tips into the other drilled holes and seal with epoxy to create a mold for the syringe mold.\nWait ∼30 min until the epoxy has completely dried.\nCarefully remove the 10-μL pipet tips.\nPrepare the syringe lead by cutting and discarding the upper ∼2 cm of a 10 μL pipet tip and attaching the remaining portion of the tip to 2 mm tubing with epoxy.\nAttach the tubing to a 10-mL syringe with a needle luer-lock attachment. Fasten the syringe into the syringe pump and set the pump to withdraw 40 μL with a ∼5 s delay.\nMethod 1: FRET of RNA & disordered proteins\nTiming: ∼3 h",
    "This step uses a FRET pair of dyes to report on the distance between two different regions in a protein-RNA interaction. The FRET dyes can be attached to each end of the annealed 18-mer RNA strand, or one dye can be replaced with a site-specific label on the protein. The FRET pair reports conformational data on the protein and RNA. Salt, protein concentration, pH, dye location, and other parameters can be modified. Flow experiments are optional here, but the initial binding of the protein to the RNA can induce unique shifts in the FRET efficiency that report on temporary conformational changes of the protein and/or RNA.\nMap the donor/acceptor channel xy-offset using a bead slide map\nMake a low-density bead mixture by diluting 3 μL tetraspeck beads in 77 μL T50.\nPipet the bead solution onto a non-PEGylated/untreated quartz slide.\nGently sandwich the slide with an untreated coverslip. Dab the edges with a tissue to collect excess buffer.\nSeal the outside edges of the slide and coverslip with fast-drying epoxy.\nAllow the epoxy to solidify for ∼10 min and transfer to a 50 mL conical vial for safekeeping.\nApply water to the objective on the TIRF microscope.\nPlace the slide on the objective; the coverslip should be facing down.\nClean the prism with ethanol. Apply ∼1 drop of immersion oil and attach the prism to the microscope so that the oil surface is touching the slide.\nTurn on the fluorescent laser to illuminate the beads. Adjust the bead alignment as needed. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nOptimize the gain, exposure time, laser intensity, and z-plane focus.\nAcquire several short (1–2 s) movies for mapping the offset (see quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis] for further instructions).\nNote: Bead slides can be stored in the dark at 20°C–25°C for up to 1–2 months.",
    "Flow reagents onto the single-molecule slide for FRET measurements. Each lane has a pair of holes, and a 200-μL tip is inserted into one hole while the flow-through is collected from the other hole.\nReplace the bead slide on the TIRF microscope with the assembled single-molecule slide from steps 1–2. The water and oil immersion surfaces will need to be prepared again as described in steps 3.f-3.j.\nFlow 50 μL 100 μg/mL NeutrAvidin onto the single-molecule surface and collect the flow-through with a folded tissue.\nIncubate for ∼5 min.\nWash the lane with 50 μL T50 buffer.\nFlow 50 μL 50 pM annealed RNA onto the single-molecule surface.\nCritical: The RNA density on the single-molecule surface should be concentrated enough to measure many binding events at once, but not too dense so as to saturate the surface; approximately 200–300 molecules per field-of-view is usually optimal. When using a new RNA construct, one lane should be used as a test to determine the labeling efficiency. If the RNA is too dense, move to the next lane and use a two- or three-fold lower concentration of RNA. If the RNA is too sparse, flow a more highly-concentrated RNA stock (e.g. 100 pM or 200 pM) into the same lane and evaluate the labeling density. This process can be repeated and fine-tuned until the optimal labeling density is achieved. It is also possible to adjust the biotin-PEG concentration on the slides, but slides are usually made in batches so adjusting the RNA concentration is more straightforward and efficient.\nNote: Photobleaching will be severe until Imaging Buffer is added to the channel.\nIncubate for ∼5 min.\nWash the lane with 50 μL T50 buffer again. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nFlow 50 μL Imaging Buffer.",
    "Acquire 1–3 long (∼60–80 s) videos and 8–10 short (∼1–2 s) videos with the donor excitation laser; longer videos are used to evaluate the FRET efficiency of individual molecules over extended time ranges whereas short movies are used to gather the FRET efficiencies of many different molecules to construct a histogram of FRET efficiency for this condition. If a shutter manager is being used and the RNA is FRET labeled, a quick 1-s excitation with the acceptor laser can be used to help filter for RNA molecules with both the donor and acceptor dyes. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nFlow 50 μL Imaging Buffer with your protein-of-interest at the desired concentration.\nNote: If the protein is labeled, the maximum concentration is ∼10 nM to avoid saturating the camera’s detector.\nNote: If the flow setup is being used, acquire a long video (60+ s) while flowing the protein onto the single-molecule surface with the syringe pump.\nAcquire 3–5 long videos and 10–12 short videos in different fields of view with the donor excitation laser. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nMore videos can be acquired after incubating the protein with the RNA for an extended period of time (e.g., 30+ min).\nNote: Lanes can be reused by either regenerating the slide as described previously (Paul et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]), or by flowing additional Imaging Buffer conditions (e.g. increased protein or salt concentrations) in the previously-used lane.\nThe movies are processed as described below (see quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis]).\nUse the other lanes to perform the appropriate controls, e.g., flowing protein without RNA immobilization, or flowing a control protein like the solubility tag or protease alone. Slides may also be regenerated as described previously (Paul et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nMethod 2: photobleaching of fluorescently tagged disordered proteins\nTiming: ∼3 h",
    "In this method, a fluorescently tagged (e.g., GFP, mCherry, etc.) disordered protein is tethered to the surface with an antibody raised against the fluorescent protein, and the tag is photobleached with strong laser exposure. The photobleaching steps are counted during the trace analysis (see below) to report on the oligomerization status of the protein, which varies depending on the protein concentration and other parameters. These experiments can be performed with a flow slide, but it is not necessary.\nSet up the TIRF microscope for the photobleaching experiment.\nApply water to the objective on the TIRF microscope.\nPlace the assembled single-molecule slide from steps 1–2 on the objective; the coverslip should be facing down.\nClean the prism with ethanol. Apply ∼1 drop of immersion oil and attach the prism to the microscope so that the oil surface is touching the slide.\nAdjust the beam alignment for TIRF imaging.\nOptimize the gain, exposure time, laser intensity, and z-plane focus for imaging the single-molecule surface.\nPhotobleaching of fluorescently-tagged proteins.\nFlow 50 μL 100 μg/mL NeutrAvidin onto the single-molecule surface and collect the flow-through with a folded tissue.\nIncubate for ∼5 min.\nWash the lane with 50 μL T50 buffer.\nFlow 50 μL 10 nM biotinylated anti-tag (e.g., anti-GFP) antibody.\nNote: As with RNA immobilization, this concentration may need to be optimized depending on the labeling density of the fluorescently tagged protein.\nIncubate for ∼5 min.\nWash again with 50 μL T50 buffer.\nFlow 50 μL Imaging Buffer containing the fluorescently tagged protein. The concentration of protein can be reliably increased up to 50 nM without saturating the imaging surface.\nAcquire 5+ long (60+ s) videos in different fields of view at maximum laser intensity in the excitation channel corresponding to the tagged protein. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]",
    "Perform a photobleaching control with the fluorescent tag alone (e.g., GFP without the conjugated RNA binding protein).\nMethod 3: nucleation of fluorescently labeled disordered proteins\nTiming: ∼2 h\nHere, a fluorescently labeled (e.g., Cy3, Cy5, etc.) protein is flowed onto the single-molecule surface, which is coated with unlabeled RNA. The RNA may also be labeled with a dye that does not interfere with the protein. The association kinetics between the RNA and protein and the oligomerization status of the protein can be determined from the single-molecule traces (see below). This method requires the automated flow of a syringe pump to accurately measure the fluorescence intensity of the protein as it is first interacting with the RNA substrate.\nSet up the TIRF microscope for a flow experiment.\nApply water to the objective on the TIRF microscope.\nPlace the assembled single-molecule slide from steps 1–2 on the objective; the coverslip should be facing down.\nAttach a 5–10 mL syringe to the syringe pump and connect it to a needle attachment. Carefully insert the vacuum tubing with a 10-μL tip attached into the needle. Insert the tip into the epoxy mold on the slide.\nNote: When using the syringe pump, less volume should be withdrawn than is added to the buffer reservoir. For instance, if 50 μL of solution is added to the reservoir, 40 μL should be withdrawn by the pump. A slower flow rate of ∼1 mL/min is recommended.\nClean the prism with ethanol. Apply ∼1 drop of immersion oil and attach the prism to the microscope so that the oil surface is touching the slide.\nAdjust the beam alignment for TIRF imaging.\nOptimize the gain, exposure time, laser intensity, and z-plane focus for imaging the single-molecule surface.\nNucleation of fluorescently labeled proteins on the single-molecule surface.",
    "Flow 40 μL 100 μg/mL NeutrAvidin by adding 50 μL to the buffer reservoir and withdrawing the solution through the syringe pump.\nIncubate for ∼5 min.\nWash the lane with 40 μL T50 buffer using the syringe pump to withdraw the T50 through the lane.\nFlow 40 μL 50 pM unlabeled RNA with the syringe pump.\nNote: The RNA can also be labeled for easier visualization of the single-molecule surface. However, the label should not interfere with the nucleation imaging. For instance, if the protein is Cy3-labeled, the RNA should be in a different channel such as Cy5. The RNA can be imaged during the flow video before the protein is added to the lane.\nIncubate for ∼5 min.\nWash using the syringe pump again with 40 μL T50 buffer.\nFlow 40 μL Imaging Buffer without the protein.\nCritical: Although the surface will not usually be imaged here, it is important to flow the Imaging Buffer before the flow experiment. This is because a dramatic change in buffer (e.g. T50 buffer to Imaging Buffer) may cause premature capillary flow of the protein-containing Imaging Buffer into the lane, which can compromise the nucleation imaging.\nAdd 40 μL Imaging Buffer with the labeled protein to the buffer reservoir. The protein concentration should not exceed 10 nM, or the surface may become saturated.\nPrepare the syringe pump with a 10-s delay (or manually delay the flow for 10 s) and find an ideal region for acquiring the video.\nStart acquisition of a long (60+ s) video and begin the delayed flow simultaneously.\nControls should be performed with single-molecule surfaces lacking RNA and with labeled control proteins.\nMethod 4: colocalization of 2+ fluorescently labeled disordered proteins\nTiming: ∼2 h",
    "Finally, this protocol uses a similar approach as method 3, but with two or more labeled proteins. Alternating excitation of multiple lasers is used to evaluate whether multiple disordered proteins are co-oligomerizing on single RNA molecules. This method requires the automated flow of a syringe pump to accurately measure the fluorescence intensity of the proteins as they are first interacting with the RNA substrate.\nRepeat Step 9.\nNucleation of two or more proteins on a single-molecule slide.\nSet up an automatic shutter manager for alternating excitation. The laser should switch every ∼1 s to capture co-binding events.\nFlow 40 μL 100 μg/mL NeutrAvidin by adding 50 μL to the buffer reservoir and withdrawing the solution through the syringe pump.\nIncubate for ∼5 min.\nWash the lane with 40 μL T50 buffer using the syringe pump to withdraw the T50 through the lane.\nFlow 40 μL 50 pM unlabeled RNA with the syringe pump.\nNote: It is more difficult to focus the z-plane for unlabeled RNA samples. It may be helpful to use one lane as a control for finding the focal plane, or background fluorescence can be used for preparing the TIRF microscope.\nAdd 40 μL Imaging Buffer with both labeled proteins to the buffer reservoir. The protein concentration in each fluorescence channel should not exceed 10 nM, or the surface may become saturated.\nPrepare the syringe pump with a 10-s delay (or manually delay the flow for 10 s) and find an ideal region for acquiring the video.\nStart acquisition of a long (60+ s) video and begin the delayed flow simultaneously."
