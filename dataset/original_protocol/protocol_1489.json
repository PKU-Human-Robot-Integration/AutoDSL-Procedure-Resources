    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSpleen collection\nTiming: 30 min\nThis section describes euthanasia and collection of spleens from mouse.\nUse healthy, 6–12 weeks old mice.\nEuthanize mice using an institutionally approved method (e.g., CO2 asphyxiation).\nPlace the mouse right side down on the dissection mat, and spray fur with 80% ethanol to disinfect.\nUsing blunt forceps and scissors, make a 1.5 cm horizontal incision in the skin on the left thorax just below the ribcage.\nDissect further through peritoneum until the spleen is visible (dark red bean-shaped organ of approximately 1 cm length).\nTo avoid tearing and potential cell loss/ damage, carefully grasp the spleen with the forceps, lift it out of the abdomen and ensure complete detachment from the pancreas.\nDislodge spleen by cutting the splenic blood vessels with fine scissors. Some bleeding is normal.\nUsing forceps, place spleen into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube containing 1 mL of cold PBS, and store on ice.\nDispose of the mouse cadaver.\nPreparation of single cell splenocytes\nTiming: 90 min\nThis section describes the preparation of murine splenic single cell suspensions.\nRemove the spleen from PBS using blunt forceps and place into a fresh Eppendorf tube.\nUsing a 22-gauge needle and 1 mL syringe, inject 1 mL of collagenase D (Col/D) Digestion Buffer at 18°C–23°C into each spleen, using multiple puncture locations to ensure Col/D reaches all parts of the tissue. The tissue typically inflates in this process, and excess digestion buffer will leak into the tube. Spleen will then be incubated immersed in digestion buffer.\nIncubate spleen immersed in digestion buffer in Eppendorf tube in a 37°C water bath for 30 min.",
    "Note: The choice of digestion enzyme can impact the antigen density on the cell surface of cells, and can therefore interfere with ability to detect antigens using flow cytometry and CITE-seq. Col/D works well in regard to detection of the antigens described in this protocol, and users should test the effects of digestion on the detection of antigens should other antibodies be used.\nNote: During cell digestion, complete the bead-based single stain compensation controls (see next section).\nTransfer contents of the splenic digestion onto a 70 μm cell strainer over a 50 mL Falcon tube and gently mash the spleen through the strainer using a rubber plunger of a 5 mL syringe.\nWash strainer with 10 mL of PBS at 18°C–23°C using a 10 mL serological pipette.\nCentrifuge splenocytes at 300 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nDecant the supernatant and resuspend cells of 1 spleen in 1 mL of Ammonium-Chloride-Potassium (ACK) lysis buffer and incubate on ice for 2 min.\nNote: Only one spleen should be processed through one cell strainer to ensure maximal cell yield. If multiple spleens need to be combined, cells should be pooled after Step 19.\nCritical: Do not let cells incubate in ACK lysis buffer for longer than 2 min as this can negatively impact cell yield and viability.\nAdd 10 mL PBS and centrifuge at 300 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nDecant supernatant and resuspend cells of one spleen (approximately 50 × 106 cells) in 1 mL of PBS.\nIf absolute cell counts are required, resuspend 20 μL of unstained cells in 20 μL trypan blue, transfer to counting slide, and count.\nNote: If cell viability of splenocytes is below 80%, PBS in digestion buffer and washes can be replaced by plain RPMI1640 media.",
    "For flow cytometry workflow proceed to step 21, for CITE-seq workflow proceed to step 59.\nFlow cytometry compensation controls\nTiming: 30 min\nThis section describes the preparation of compensation controls for flow cytometry.\nNote: Due to overlapping emission spectra of diverse fluorochromes, a spill over of fluorescence from the primary to the secondary detector is common for certain combinations of fluorochromes, and needs to be corrected in a process termed compensation. The accuracy of compensation is paramount to distinguish positive and negative signals, and therefore requires special attention. The topic of compensation can be explored in detail elsewhere (Cossarizza et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). The protocol here uses beads to acquire compensation controls, while other protocols might suggest using cells as single-color controls. Each of these methods has disadvantages which should be considered on the basis of the experiment.\nVortex compensation beads for 30 s to break up aggregates.\nPipette 20 μL of bead solution to empty FACS tubes, followed by 80 μL of FACS buffer.\nNote: The manufacturer recommends to use one drop (approx. 20 μL) of beads per single stain control, however we have found that beads can be diluted in FACS buffer in up to a 1:3 dilution.\nPipette 1 μL of the corresponding antibody to each tube.\nIncubate on ice or at 4°C in the dark for 15 min.\nAdd 1 mL of FACS buffer.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nCarefully decant supernatant.\nResuspend in 200 μL of FACS buffer.\nKeep compensation controls on ice or at 4°C in the dark until acquisition.\nFlow cytometry sample antibody staining\nTiming: 2 h\nThis section describes the incubation of single cells with fluorescence-tagged antibodies.",
    "Critical: Advanced flow cytometry require a deep understanding of the technology including panel design based on antigen-density, spectral overlap, spreading errors, compensation and downstream data analysis that lie beyond the scope of this protocol. New users to flow cytometry are strongly encouraged to seek expert advice, mentoring and training by their flow cytometry facility before commencing experiments. Useful additional resources can be found here: (Cossarizza et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Brummelman et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Mair and Tyznik, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]).\nCritical: All antibodies and buffers should be kept on ice while preparing antibody solutions. Antibody solutions should be prepared fresh within the hour of sample incubation to minimise chances for antibody interaction, and kept shielded from light.\nNote: A complete list of antibodies to immunophenotype splenic myeloid cells is provided in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. This panel was developed and optimised based on a similar panel developed by (Dipiazza et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). The panel can be extended, and channels that are suitable for the addition of antibodies which detect functional features are indicated. Antibody concentrations can be found under materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1032_9.csv\nPipette approximately 5 × 106 splenocytes into FACS tubes for the unstained sample and each experimental sample tube, and 2 × 106 splenocytes into a live/dead single stain control tube.\nNote: Falcon® 5 mL Round Bottom Polystyrene tubes work well to retain myeloid cells, and allow the addition of sufficient volumes of FACS buffer for washing steps.\nNote: Alternative to a cell-based single cell control for live-dead stain, amine-reactive compensation beads can be used here. The stain index of these beads can be improved by dilution in PBS and incubation at 18°C–23°C to encourage the covalent binding reaction.\nKeep unstained sample on ice or at 4°C until acquisition.",
    "Transfer half of live/dead single stain cells into a fresh Eppendorf tube and put on a heat plate set at 50°C for 10 min to initiate cell death.\nDuring incubation time, prepare a Fc block/FVS solution as outlined in materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment].\nAfter 10 min, place dead cells on ice for 2 min, then transfer back to original live/dead Eppendorf tube containing live cells.\nCentrifuge live/dead single stain and experimental sample tubes at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDecant supernatant.\nAdd 50 μL of live/dead/Fc-block cocktail to experimental samples and live/dead single stain.\nCritical: Live/dead labelling must be performed in PBS only. The presence of FCS in FACS buffer will bind live/dead reagent and interfere with live/dead staining of splenocytes.\nIncubate on ice or at 4°C in the dark for 15 min.\nDuring incubation time prepare antibody cocktail using the desired concentration of each antibody in 40 μL FACS buffer + 10 μL Brilliant Stain buffer per experimental sample (upscale according to number of experimental samples plus 10%, see antibody cocktail constituent table in materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nNote: The antibody concentrations provided in this protocol are optimized for a cell number of 5 × 106 cells which are stained in a final volume of 50 μL. Because antibody binding depends on the cell number, cell density and antibody density, both volume and antibody need to be adjusted with any change in cell numbers.\nNote: Brilliant Stain Buffer should be used if more than one BD Brilliant dye is used to prevent non-specific polymer interactions. 10 μL of Brilliant Stain Buffer should be added to the antibody cocktail for each experimental sample.",
    "Critical: To distinguish specific staining from abnormalities derived from fluorescence spillover, spreading error and cell-type specific autofluorescence, fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls should be included (Mair and Tyznik, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]). These controls are especially critical when measuring features with low to medium antigen density and a clear bimodal expression pattern (expressed and not expressed) is not expected.\nAdd 1 mL of PBS to all tubes incubated with live/dead/Fc-block cocktail, and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDecant supernatant.\nNote: Using a smooth ‘invert-pour-tab-revert’ movement, pour supernatant followed by a brief and gentle tab to paper towel to absorb remaining liquid. Cell pellets are routinely not disturbed by this action.\nResuspend live/dead single stain control in 400 μL of FACS buffer and leave on ice or at 4°C in the dark until acquisition.\nResuspend experimental samples each in 50 μL of antibody cocktail.\nIncubate samples on ice or at 4°C in the dark for 20 min.\nAdd 1 mL FACS buffer and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDecant supernatants.\nResuspend cell pellets in 400 μL of FACS buffer store on ice or at 4°C in the dark until acquisition.\nNote: Once stained, unfixed experimental samples should be acquired within 2 h to ensure viability, and avoid fluorochrome degradation.\nCritical: This protocol has not been tested with fixation reagents. Any method of fixation, should be tested prior as fixation can negatively affect tandem fluorophores. If fixation is required, compensation controls also need to be treated with fixation agents, and the user should refer to fixation protocols (Cossarizza et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nFlow cytometry data acquisition\nTiming: ∼2 h\nThis section describes a basic workflow to acquire cells using a BD FACSymphony A5 flow cytometer.",
    "Critical: Flow cytometers should only be operated by trained users. Detailed guidelines for optimal instrument set up have been discussed elsewhere (Mair and Tyznik, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]), and users of this protocol will need to be familiar with these processes, or have their samples acquired by professional instrument operators.\nVortex and strain cells through a FACS tube microstrainer using a disposable transfer pipette immediately before loading onto cytometer.\nUsing unstained cells, manipulate PMT voltages to adjust forward and side scatter (FSC/SSC), and reflect 3 times of the robust standard deviation (rSD) for each channel in order to ensure comparable fluorophore sensitivity across all channels (Wang and Hoffman, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]).\nNote: Using 3 × rSD to set PMT voltages reliably approximates appropriate signal detection while reducing electronic noise. However, for dim signals, a range of up to 10 × rSD is recommended (Cossarizza et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Manipulated rSD values should be derived from pre-gated lymphocytes using the forward and side scatter gate.\nAfter setting voltages, begin acquisition of single stain compensation controls, beginning with the unstained sample according to the automatic compensation workflow instructions of your specific cytometer.\nVortex compensation tubes for 3–5 s to resuspend beads before acquisition.\nAcquire 5000 total events for each compensation control.\nNote: Successful automatic compensation depends on a sufficiently high stain index of the compensation controls, that optimally is larger than the stain index of the antibody in the sample. Bead-based compensation controls typically provide a high stain index, but can at times for yet unknown reasons lead to overcompensation (Brummelman et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nFollowing compensation control acquisition, perform automatic compensation calculation.\nVortex experimental samples before acquisition to ensure cells are in solution. Acquire at least 2 × 106 events of FSC/SSC lymphocyte gate of each experimental sample for adequate resolution.\nExport flow cytometry standard (FCS) files.",
    "Flow cytometry data analysis\nTiming: ∼4–8 h\nThis section describes a basic workflow to carry out quality control of the acquired flow cytometry data and the delineation of the myeloid cells in murine spleen. The steps below give a guideline to analyze flow cytometric data using Kaluza software (Beckman Coulter, version 3.1). Other software are available and the principles for data analysis remain the same.\nVerify and correct automatic compensation if required.\nCritical: The success of the automatic compensation algorithms depends on multiple factors, and can under circumstances lead to over- and undercompensation. A very careful quality control of the compensation matrix is essential before commencing any data analysis. This compensation quality control should only be carried out by highly experienced flow cytometry experts, who have an in-depth understanding of fluorochrome spill over, spreading errors and the effects of cell-type specific autofluorescence. If a manual modification to the algorithm-based compensation is required, this too should only be attempted by experts in the field, and is prone to subjectivity-derived error.\nAchieving accurate algorithm-based compensation can be challenging and might require comparison of bead- and cell-based compensation controls (Liechti and Roederer, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]), and if differences are observed, cell-based compensation controls should be considered as biologically relevant gold standard (Cossarizza et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Working forward with either a falsely algorithm-based or a falsely manually corrected compensation has major implications to the data analysis and interpretation of data. The steps outlined below provide a basic NxN (every parameter against every parameter) approach how to quality check the compensation and attempt correction.\nImport FCS files to the analysis software of choice.\nTo omit debris and isolate lymphocytes, generate a FSC-A/SCC-A bivariate plot, and gate populations of interest (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).",
    "To omit doublets, generate a FSC-A/FSC-H bivariate plot, and gate events in a linear, 45 degree line (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nCreate a bivariate plot for each used channel, with the channel on the X axis.\nHighlight all plots and change the Y axes to the first channel.\nIf typical patterns that suggest overcompensation (“super-negative” events) or undercompensation (“leaning” triangular populations) are observed, correct compensation as required (see example provided in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nChange Y axes to the next channel and repeat compensation correction.\nRepeat for all channels.\nNote: We find that when a manual compensation is required, the complete NxN approach should be carried out at least twice, or until a full round of NxN can be completed without further modifications are needed. This can be laborious but is critical to the quality of data.\nApply corrected compensation to all experimental samples.\nIdentify myeloid cells based on gating strategy demonstrated in Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]. Begin by isolating live, single, leukocytes, and then excluding non-target populations such as T-cells (CD3+), and B-cells (CD19+).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1032-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Compensation of fluorochrome spill over\nCompensation using bead-based single-color controls can lead to over- and undercompensation in a cell-based sample, which requires manual correction.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1032-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Flow cytometry gating strategy for a 16-color murine myeloid panel\nSplenocytes of C57BL/6 mice were incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry. Red boxes indicate final target populations.\n(A) CD45+ leukocytes were identified after exclusion of debris, doublet discrimination and exclusion of dead cells.\n(B) From CD45+ cells, B cells and NKT/T cells were excluded, and Ly6G+ neutrophils were validated based on CD11b expression. pDCs were identified as PDCA1+. From PDCA1- cells, macrophages were delineated based on expression of F4/80 and absence of Ly6C- and CD11c-.",
    "(C) Monocytes were identified from CD3-CD19-Ly6G-PDCA1- cells as Ly6C+, and monocyte diversity was further identified through differential expression of CD11b and CD172a.\n(D) cDCs were identified from CD3-CD19-Ly6G-PDCA1-Ly6C- cells based on expression of MHC-II+ and CD11c+. cDCs were subdivided into cDC1 (XCR1+CD172a-) and cDC2 (CD172a+XCR1-) cells, and their identity was verified by expression of CD24 and CD11b, respectively. cDC1 and cDC2 cells were further subdivided into CD4+ and CD4- cells.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1032-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Representative flow cytometry gating tree for delineating murine myeloid cells in spleen\nNote: Identical gating strategy should be applied to all experimental samples. However, when analyzing samples of different origins (eg. unstimulated versus stimulated, or spleen versus lymph node), the expression level of features can differ, and gate limits should be chosen to include these differences.\nExport statistics (cell numbers, percentages, median fluorescence intensity (MFI) data) for significance testing.\nEnrichment of myeloid cells\nTiming: 20 min\nThis section describes magnetic bead enrichment of myeloid cells using a negative isolation of non-T and non-B cells, with the aim to reduce sorting time and thus increase cell viability post sorting. The following steps are in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol (EasySep™ Mouse Streptavidin RapidSpheres™ Isolation Kit).\nNote: We pooled splenocytes of 6 C57BL/6 mice, and used 2 × 108 splenocytes for myeloid cell enrichment. This allowed us to subsequently sort ∼50,000 DCs.\nResuspend splenocytes at 1 × 108 cells/mL in FACS buffer in a round bottomed 5 mL tube.\nAdd 5 μL/mL of biotin conjugated anti-TCRb and biotin conjugated 5 μL/mL anti-CD19 to the cell solution.\nIncubate for 10 min at 18°C–23°C.\nAdd 75 μL of RapidSpheresTM magnetic beads and incubate for 2.5 min at 18°C–23°C.\nPlace the tube in an EasySepTM magnet and incubate for 2.5 min.",
    "Carefully decant the supernatant with the myeloid cells into a new FACS tube.\nFluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS)\nTiming: ∼2 h\nThis section is to isolate DCs to high purity using FACS. This reduces the levels of debris, doublets and unwanted cells for downstream sequencing.\nCritical: Cell sorting requires highly trained staff and should be carried out optimally by a flow cytometry core facility.\nUse all enriched cells from the previous step, set aside a small quantity of cells for unstained and single stain controls for compensation. Single stain controls can alternatively be bead-based as described in the section flow cytometry compensation controls[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3].\nStain cells with Fc-block (1:100) and live/dead cell stain (1:250) for 20 min on ice.\nWash with 1 mL PBS and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nResuspend pellet with anti-MHCII-APC-Cy7 (1:400) and anti-CD11c-PE-Cy7 (1:200) in 500 μL FACS buffer and incubate for 20 min on ice.\nCritical: If oligo-tagged antibodies for CITE-seq overlap with antibodies used for sorting, a different antibody clone needs to used. For antibody staining of CD11c, we used the clone HL3 for sorting, and the clone N418 for CITE-seq.\nWash cells with 3 mL FACS buffer, centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C and resuspend in 1 mL FACS buffer\nSet up cell sorter PMT voltages and compensation using unstained and single stained cells.\nDetermine cells and eliminate debris with FCS-H vs SSC-H.\nDetermine single cells with FSC-A vs FSC-H and SSC-A vs SSC-H.\nDetermine live cells as live/dead stain negative.\nDetermine cDCs as MHCII+CD11c+.\nSort cells into FACS tube containing 500 μL 100% FCS.\nDilute with 2 mL FACS buffer and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.",
    "Note: Record a small fraction of the sorted cells to check post sort purity and viability (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1032-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. DC sorting\nMyeloid enriched splenocytes were incubated with live/dead stain, Fc-block and antibodies against CD11c and MHCII. DCs were sorted as alive single CD11c+MHCII+ cells to a purity >90%.\nIncubation of DCs with nucleotide barcoded antibodies\nTiming: 1 h\nHere, cells are stained with oligo-tagged antibodies that are conjugated with nucleotide sequences specific for each antibody. The steps listed below are in accordance with BioLegend CITE-seq protocol for TotalSeq-A antibodies and 10× Genomics Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kit v3.1 (https://www.biolegend.com/en-us/protocols/totalseq-a-antibodies-and-cell-hashing-with-10x-single-cell-3-reagent-kit-v3-3-1-protocol[href=https://www.biolegend.com/en-us/protocols/totalseq-a-antibodies-and-cell-hashing-with-10x-single-cell-3-reagent-kit-v3-3-1-protocol]).\nResuspend cell pellet from the sort in Cell Staining Buffer (1 ×10ˆ6mouse cells in 49.5 μL) in a FACS tube.\nAdd 0.5 μL of TruStain FcX™ PLUS (anti-mouse CD16/32) antibody per 49.5 μL cell suspension and incubate for 10 min at 4°C.\nPrepare antibody pool using titrated amount (up to 1 μg of each TotalSeq-A antibody). Add Cell Staining Buffer to make the volume of the antibody pool 50 μL for each 50 μL cell suspension.\nTo remove antibody aggregates, centrifuge the antibody pool at 1,400 × g for 10 min at 4°C and carefully pipette out the antibody pool without touching the bottom of the tube.\nAdd the 50 μL of antibody pool to each 50 μL of cell suspension.\nIncubate for 30 min on ice.\nWash with 3 mL Cell Staining Buffer and centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDecant supernatant.\nRepeat wash twice.\nResuspend cell pellet in 250 μL Cell Staining Buffer and immediately move to the next step.",
    "Note: Antibody validation and titration should be performed prior to carrying out this protocol. It is possible to titrate the oligo-tagged antibodies using either single cell sequencing read outs (https://www.biolegend.com/en-us/blog/titrating-totalseq-antibodies[href=https://www.biolegend.com/en-us/blog/titrating-totalseq-antibodies]), which is costly, or by flow cytometry using the same clone with a fluorophore or dT-oligonucleotide tagged fluorescent dye. An example of oligo-tagged antibody validation at a concentration of 0.5 μg and using a dT-oligonucleotide tagged fluorescent dye is shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]. However, because sequencing is more sensitive than flow cytometry, the optimal antibody concentration for flow cytometry might not be the optimal antibody concentration for sequencing. The accurate identification of the optimal antibody concentration without the need for sequencing represents a current limitation to the technology.\nOptional: According to the 10× Genomics protocol for Cell Surface Protein Labelling, cells can be stained with oligo-tagged antibodies simultaneously with fluorochrome conjugated antibodies prior to sorting (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/overview/doc/demonstrated-protocol-cell-surface-protein-labeling-for-single-cell-rna-sequencing-protocols[href=https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/overview/doc/demonstrated-protocol-cell-surface-protein-labeling-for-single-cell-rna-sequencing-protocols]). Staining prior to sorting can have advantages: it may reduce the number of unbound oligo-tagged antibodies as the cells will be washed multiple times in the sorting process; and reduce the time between cell isolation and downstream steps, thus reducing the time until cell lysis. However, this requires staining a higher number of cells and the amount of oligo-tagged antibodies needs to be adjusted accordingly.\nOptional: To distinguish oligo-tagged antibody specific binding and background noise, users can consider a spike-in of cells that are negative for the antibody-specific epitopes. For example, for CITE-seq experiments of murine cells, users can spike in human cells. This provides an internal control for antibody background noise. Alternatively, if a diverse population of cells is processed, cells that are considered negative for epitope expression can be used to determine background (Lukowski et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nCritical: Wash thoroughly after oligo-tagged antibody staining to reduce background noise from unbound antibodies.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1032-Fig5.jpg",
    "Figure 5. Total-Seq-A antibody validation\nSplenocytes were incubated with flow cytometry live-dead stain, Fc-block and antibodies against MHCII and CD11c, and each Total-Seq-A antibody which was conjugated to a dT-oligonucleotide tagged fluorescence dye. Flow cytometry and Total-Seq-A antibodies against CD11c were specific to different epitopes.\n10× chromium platform and library preparation\nTiming: 1.5 days\nThis step includes generating gel beads in emulsions (GEMs), barcoding, cDNA amplification and library construction.\nNote: Due to Chromium kit updates that have occurred since the original study (Lukowski et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]), the instructions and resources outlined below differ slightly from what was performed at the time. We describe below the current best-practice workflow, using the most updated kits available, as a recommendation for how we would conduct the experiment today.\nNote: Single cell sequencing experiments are highly technical and expensive to perform. If you are inexperienced with single cell library preparation and sequencing, or there are aspects that will be performed by a core facility, we advise discussing your project in advance with the facility or with 10× Genomics technical support. Understanding the requirements and key points at each step of the protocol will give the best chance for a successful outcome.\nCritical: The Chromium library preparation protocol is required to be performed in a timely manner once cells are ready. It is imperative that the relevant protocols and user guides have been read thoroughly and are familiar to the user before beginning, and all necessary reagents and consumables have been acquired and prepared in advance.\nPrepare all necessary reagents for GEM generation as outlined in the 10× Genomics Chromium User Guide (https://assets.ctfassets.net/an68im79xiti/1W6c5yj7FAiBQdOKabc6sc/06e962ecdff018fb20b6979859cf1f5e/CG000317_ChromiumNextGEMSingleCell3-v3.1_CellSurfaceProtein_RevB.pdf[href=https://assets.ctfassets.net/an68im79xiti/1W6c5yj7FAiBQdOKabc6sc/06e962ecdff018fb20b6979859cf1f5e/CG000317_ChromiumNextGEMSingleCell3-v3.1_CellSurfaceProtein_RevB.pdf]).\nManually count cells and ensure that cell viability is above 80%",
    "For super-loading of the Chromium reaction (targeting more than 10,000 cells per reaction), consult the table on page 33 of the Cell Multiplexing User Guide (https://assets.ctfassets.net/an68im79xiti/Ic17bUxh3yu95BmBNGsE3/3d333cebd76782ed1ccf8a032bb3e294/CG000388_ChromiumNextGEMSingleCell3-v3.1_CellMultiplexing_Rev_A.pdf[href=https://assets.ctfassets.net/an68im79xiti/Ic17bUxh3yu95BmBNGsE3/3d333cebd76782ed1ccf8a032bb3e294/CG000388_ChromiumNextGEMSingleCell3-v3.1_CellMultiplexing_Rev_A.pdf]) to determine the appropriate volume of cells to add for a particular concentration. For example, to target 15,000 single cells would require ∼27.5uL of a cell suspension at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/mL.\nPrepare gene expression and CITE-seq libraries by following the steps outlined in the BioLegend TotalSeq-A protocol (https://www.BioLegend.com/en-us/protocols/totalseq-a-antibodies-and-cell-hashing-with-10x-single-cell-3-reagent-kit-v3-3-1-protocol[href=https://www.biolegend.com/en-us/protocols/totalseq-a-antibodies-and-cell-hashing-with-10x-single-cell-3-reagent-kit-v3-3-1-protocol]) and the 10x Genomics Chromium User Guide (https://assets.ctfassets.net/an68im79xiti/1W6c5yj7FAiBQdOKabc6sc/06e962ecdff018fb20b6979859cf1f5e/CG000317_ChromiumNextGEMSingleCell3-v3.1_CellSurfaceProtein_RevB.pdf[href=https://assets.ctfassets.net/an68im79xiti/1W6c5yj7FAiBQdOKabc6sc/06e962ecdff018fb20b6979859cf1f5e/CG000317_ChromiumNextGEMSingleCell3-v3.1_CellSurfaceProtein_RevB.pdf]).\nNote: Start GEM generation immediately after oligo-tagged antibody staining to minimize cell death. It is recommended that the viability of the samples at this point is >80%. Using low-viability samples can impact data quality due to increased ambient RNA from dead and dying cells.\nCritical: Ensure that you are following the TotalSeq-A protocol to include ADT additive primer in the cDNA amplification mix, and save the low molecular weight fragments in the supernatant of the post-amplification clean-up, otherwise a CITE-seq library will not be able to be generated for your sample.\nPause point: Purified full-length amplified cDNA (including CITE-seq cDNA) and final libraries can both be stored at −20oC until moving forward to library preparation or sequencing, respectively.\nNote: To reduce the possibility of index cross-talk, if possible avoid using the following combinations of CITE-seq indexes with samples intended for the same sequencing run:\n- RPI01 and RPI09\n- RPI08 and RPI12",
    "The above index combinations have a Sequence-Levenshtein edit distance of 2. All other combinations of CITE-seq (RPI01 to RPI12) and Chromium (SI-TT-A1 to SI-TT-H12) indexes have an edit distance of >=3, allowing for accurate correction of a single base mismatch caused by substitution, insertion or deletion. If the pairs noted above must be used together, it would be preferable to adjust the default parameters during fastq generation to allow no mismatches.\nNote: Both 10× Genomics and BioLegend will periodically provide version updates for the protocols cited above. The documents in this protocol are the latest versions at time of writing; you may want to check to confirm you are using the most up-to-date protocol available before starting your experiment, as subsequent updates may improve performance and outcomes.\nIllumina sequencing\nTiming: 1 day\nThis section generates sequencing data from the prepared gene expression and CITE-seq libraries.",
    "Pool libraries and sequence according to desired sequencing depth. For the antibody pool used here, we recommend pooling the CITE-seq and gene expression libraries for each sample at a 10% and 90% molar ratio respectively. When sequencing two samples targeting 15,000 cells each with this pooling, you can expect to generate >20,000 gene expression reads per cell (the minimum recommended by 10× Genomics) using a NovaSeq SP 100 cycle sequencing run. Sequencing kits can be scaled up as needed for projects with greater sample numbers. For projects utilizing higher numbers of antibodies, it will be necessary to increase the pooling proportion of the CITE-seq libraries accordingly to ensure adequate read numbers for each antibody used. The minimum recommended sequencing depth for 10× Genomics gene expression libraries is 20,000 reads per cell and 5,000 reads per cell for barcoded antibody (CITE-seq) libraries. It is important to note that if the number of barcoded antibodies increases significantly or includes highly abundant proteins such as CD45, the read depth per cell may require adjustment.\nNote: Pooled CITE-seq/gene expression libraries can be run using the recommended configuration of Read1 – 28bases, Index1 – 10bases, Index2 – 10bases, Read2 – 90 bases.\nData pre-processing\nTiming: 1 day\nThis section includes initial data pre-processing using Cell Ranger software to generate fastq files for each sample and count tables containing both gene expression and CITE-seq feature information.\nRaw sequencing data from the Illumina platform is in the BCL format. These raw files must be demultiplexed into individual samples and subsequently converted to fastq files. This can be achieved using the 10× Genomics Cell Ranger mkfastq pipeline in conjunction with the sample-specific index barcodes. Follow the instructions for running the Cell Ranger mkfastq pipeline found on the 10× Genomics support site: https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/using/mkfastq[href=https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/using/mkfastq].",
    "Cell Ranger mkfastq requires a comma-separated table with columns specifying the flowcell lane, sample names and indexes used. It is possible to process multiple library types at once, which avoids the need to run mkfastq once for each library type. However some modifications to the recommended SimpleCSV samplesheet are required. In this modification, the CITE-seq library indexes can be presented in the SimpleCSV samplesheet in a dual-index format. To do this, add ‘ATCT’ (the four bases immediately following the 6 bp index in the adaptor sequence) to the end of each index sequence, then provide the sequence ‘GTGTAGATCT’ in an additional ‘Index2’ column. This will be the sequence generated from single-indexed CITE-seq library fragments by the i5 index primer. The 10× dual index TT Set A ID can be replicated in both ‘Index’ and ‘Index2’ columns for the gene expression libraries. Please see example below for generating fastq files for samples using RPI01 (ATCACG) and RPI02 (CGATGT) CITE-seq indexes, for samples run on a NovaSeq6000 platform with v1.5 kits.\nLane,Sample,Index,Index2\n∗,CDC_WT,SI-TT-A1,SI-TT-A1\n∗,CS_CDC_WT,ATCACGATCT,GTGTAGATCT\n∗,CDC_BATF3_KO,SI-TT-A2,SI-TT-A2\n∗,CS_CDC_BATF3_KO,CGATGTATCT,GTGTAGATCT\nNote: The exemplary samples CDC_WT and CDC_BATF3_KO were sorted cDCs from wildtype and Batf3−/− mice published in (Lukowski et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nUsing the fastq files generated in Step 1, follow the instructions for running the Cell Ranger count pipeline with feature barcoding, which utilizes Cell Ranger Feature Barcoding capabilities to incorporate the CITE-seq information in the output gene-count matrix: https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/using/feature-bc-analysis[href=https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/using/feature-bc-analysis].\nThe reference genomes and annotations for mouse (GRCm38) and human (GRCh38) required for Cell Ranger count can be obtained from the 10× Genomics website, or can be provided by the user.",
    "Following the generation of sample-level count matrices by Cell Ranger count, multiple samples can be combined into a single large matrix using Cell Ranger aggr (aggregate). It is also possible to analyze each sample individually without the use of the aggregate function.\nAfter count matrix aggregation, the dataset comprising gene and protein expression values is ready for analysis in Seurat or other software.\nNote: The strand read by the i5 sequencing primer depends on the sequencing platform used. The index2 sequence presented above is for sequencers using a ‘reverse complement’ workflow for dual-indexing, as for NovaSeq6000 with v1.5 kits. The index2 sequence should be modified to use the reverse complement if a ‘forward strand’ workflow is used, for example on a NovaSeq6000 with v1.0 kits.\nNote: If single-indexed gene expression libraries are generated (with SI-GA-xx index IDs), a SimpleCSV with a single index column is sufficient. In this case, to accommodate an 8bp i7 index read, the suffix ‘AT’ can be added to the CITE-seq indexes. The SimpleCSV for the same example as above would then look like this:\nLane,Sample,Index\n∗,CDC_WT,SI-GA-A1\n∗,CS_CDC_WT,ATCACGAT\n∗,CDC_BATF3_KO,SI-GA-A2\n∗,CS_CDC_BATF3_KO,CGATGTAT"
