    "Streak recipient R. capsulatus strain on RCV agar plate (with appropriate antibiotics) and incubate at 30 °C for 2-3 days.   Streak donor E. coli strain (and helper E. coli) on LB agar plate with appropriate antibiotics and incubate at 37 °C overnight.   Inoculate 4 ml of RCV broth (with appropriate antibiotics) with a single colony of the recipient R. capsulatus strain and incubate at 30 °C in a 200-250 rpm shaker for 2 days.   One day later inoculate 4 ml of LB broth (with appropriate antibiotics) with donor E. coli strain, and 4 ml of LB broth with helper E. coli strain if applicable (see Materials and Reagents for examples), and incubate at 37 °C in a 200-250 rpm shaker overnight.   In separate sterile microcentrifuge tubes transfer 100 μl of donor E. coli strain, 100 μl of helper E. coli strain (if applicable), and 200 μl of recipient R. capsulatus strain. Each strain should be in mid- to late- log phase.   Spin microcentrifuge tubes containing cultures at 3,500 x g for 1 min. in bench-top centrifuge.   Decant all supernatant from microcentrifuge tubes.   Resuspend cell pellets in 500 μl RCV broth per microcentrifuge tube to wash away residual antibiotics and LB broth.   Spin microcentrifuge tubes containing resuspended cultures at 4,000 x g for 1 min in bench-top centrifuge.   Decant all supernatant from microcentrifuge tubes.   Resuspend donor E. coli strain cell pellet in 50 μl RCV broth.   Transfer all of the resuspended donor E. coli strain to helper E. coli strain cell pellet and resuspend (if applicable).   Transfer all of the resuspended donor E. coli strain (and helper E. coli strain) to the recipient R. capsulatus strain and resuspend.   Aliquot 10 μl drops of donor-helper-recipient mix onto a dry RCV agar plate (no antibiotics) and allow for the drops to dry.",
    "Incubate plate upside down at 30 °C for 1-2 days. R. capsulatus but not E. coli will grow on the RCV agar plate and the cells are ready when the conjugation spots have a red ring around it. The middle of the spot will likely be pale pink.   Streak the conjugation spots onto RCV agar plates containing appropriate antibiotic to select for the cell containing the plasmid (see Materials and Reagents for plasmid example). Do this by scraping the red ring around the conjugation spot up with an inoculation loop.   Incubate streaked plate at 30 °C for 3-4 days or until you see colonies.   Optional (this will also be done in step 20): Test the R. capsulatus colonies for plasmid using your choice method, such as colony PCR.    Restreak colony on YPS agar plate containing appropriate antibiotics and incubate at 30 °C for 2-3 days to ensure that it is “clean” of E. coli cells. Although E. coli does not grow on RCV, it can survive. E. coli will grow on YPS agar plates. This YPS agar plate will isolate R. capsulatus cells containing the conjugated plasmid from the E. coli survivors as individual colonies. You can visually identify single R. capsulatus colonies on this YPS agar plate. It will be pink/maroon in colour compared to the cream colored E. coli colonies.   Test the “non-contaminated” R. capsulatus colonies for the conjugated plasmid by colony PCR."
