    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCo-culture of pp65-specific CD4 T cell and pp65-pulsed γδ T cell\nTiming: 2 h\nIn this step, CD4 T cell isolated from pp65-stimulated PBMCs is co-cultured with pp65-pulsed γδ-T cell before proceeding to immunofluorescent assay. It is Day 1 for co-culture experiment, as well as Day 15 for the whole experimental procedure.\nCo-culture\nNuncTM Lab-TekTM II 8-well chambered coverglass is used for the co-culture experiment.\nNote: The NuncTM Lab-TekTM II 8-well chambered coverglass is made up of cell-culture treated glass bottom chambers, which allowed our cells to adhere to the bottom of chamber after overnight culture. Since we sought to analyze the cell-cell interaction, the situation that cells tightly adhere to the chamber bottom before cell-cell interaction should be avoided. Therefore, we do not recommend using coating reagents facilitating cell adherence, for instance, fibronectin and poly-L-lysine.\nCo-culture CD4 T cell isolated from pp65-stimulated PBMCs or unstimulated PBMCs with pp65-pulsed activated or unactivated γδ-T cell, at a ratio of γδ-T:CD4 T = 1:1 (a total of 0.2 million cells in 200 μL R10 medium per well) overnight (around 18 h). Thus, eight groups are involved:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_594_6.csv\nNote: The recommended culture volume in the NuncTM Lab-TekTM II 8-well chambered coverglass is 0.2–0.5 mL, which is capable of culturing 0.2 million to 0.5 million cells at the density of ~1 million cells per mL. To assist the cells to settle at the bottom of the well, culture volume lower than 0.4 mL would be better. Thus, the maximal cell number per well should be 0.4 million in 0.4 mL culture.\nNote: In total, 24 wells (8 groups × 3 donors) are needed. Cells are cultured in a 37°C/5% CO2 incubator overnight (around 18 h).",
    "Critical: For the sake of seeing specific conjugates, co-culture of “unstimulated CD4 T cell and pp65-pulsed γδ-T cell” and co-culture of “pp65-specific CD4 T cell and unactivated γδ-T cell” should be included as control.\nCritical: Spare one or two more wells serving for the secondary antibody control in the immunofluorescence assay.\nImmunofluorescence assay\nTiming: 2 days\nγδ-T cells and CD4 T cells are allowed to interact after 18-h co-culture, cells are then subjected to immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and evaluated with confocal microscopy (Day 15 overnight to Day 16, for the whole experimental procedure).\nFollowing overnight (~18 h) co-culture, cells are now ready for antibody staining.\nOn Day 1 for immunofluorescence assay, using a 200 μL pipette, aspirate the media slowly and carefully from top-to-bottom at the bottom-right corner of each well.\nCritical: After overnight culture, these suspension cells should be settled down on the bottom of each well though they are not attached tightly, as mentioned above. In order to avoid lifting of the cells and to minimize cell loss, the procedure of moving the chamber, aspirating or adding any buffer should be done slowly and carefully along the sides of the wells. For consistency, the down-right corner of each well should be fixed for removing the media or PBS, while the upper-left corner of each well is used to add buffer, in a slow and gentle manner. This applies for the rest of the following steps.\nAdd 200 μL PBS slowly and gently to each well at the upper-left corner.\nAspirate the PBS slowly and carefully from top-to-bottom at the bottom-right corner of each well.\nAdd 200 μL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, dissolved in PBS, pH 7.4) to each well and keep it at room temperature (22°C~28°C) in the dark for 20 min to fix the cells.",
    "Aspirate the 4% PFA and wash with 200 μL PBS twice.\nAdd 200 μL of Perm/Block buffer and keep the chamber at 4°C for 20 min.\nWash with 200 μL Staining Buffer twice.\nIncubate with primary antibodies in 200 μL Staining Buffer at 4°C overnight (~18 h). For example, in our experiment, we used the following primary antibodies:\nPanel 1: anti-Δ42PD1 (CH34, Mouse IgG2b, 1:100), anti-Vδ2 (15D, Mouse IgG1, 1:20), and anti-TLR4 (HTA125, Mouse IgG2a, 1:20).\nPanel 2: anti-Δ42PD1 (CH34, Mouse IgG2b, 1:100), anti-HLA-DR (L243, Mouse IgG2a, 1:250), anti-TLR4 (25, Mouse IgG1, 1:50)\nCritical: For non-specific signal control, do not use primary antibodies and only add appropriate secondary antibodies.\nOn the next day (Day 2 for immunofluorescence assay), wash with 200 μL Staining Buffer twice.\nIncubate with secondary antibodies in 200 μL Staining Buffer at 4°C for 30 min. In our experiment, we used the following secondary antibodies for the above both panels:\nGoat anti-mouse IgG1 AF488 (1:1000), goat anti-mouse IgG2a AF568 (1:1000) and goat anti-mouse IgG2b 647 (1:1000).\nWash with 200 μL Staining Buffer twice.\nMount the cells by adding 200 μL SlowFadeTM Gold antifade reagent with DAPI, and incubate at room temperature (22°C~28°C) in the dark for 30 min.\nCritical: Unlike coverslip/microscope slides, the chamber is not needed to be turned upside-down for imaging, as it is imaged from the bottom of the chamber. No coverslip is needed here as well. However, sufficient volume of the mounting medium (200 μL) is important to fully cover the cells and to prevent evaporation.\nOptional: If mounting with SlowFadeTM reagent without DAPI, cells can be stained with DAPI in 200 μL PBS at room temperature (22°C~28°C in the dark; incubation time depends on the instruction of different commercial products) and then washed with 200 μL PBS before applying mounting medium.",
    "Keep the chamber with the lid at 4°C before imaging under confocal microscope.\nNote: It is better to perform imaging as soon as possible to get clearer signals without bleaching, within one month after IFA is done.\nPause Point: The chamber can be kept in dark place at 4°C, placed in a sealed container or glad wrapped, for the purpose of protecting from light and from drying, if performing confocal microscopy at a later time.\n3D imaging using confocal microscope\nTiming: Depends on availability of the confocal microscope at your institution and familiarity of operation, it may take multiple sessions of several hours to obtain sufficient data.\nIn this step, IFA samples can be imaged using confocal microscopes such as LSM700, LSM800 and Leica SP 5 II. We mainly focused on the colocalization of the signal of Δ42PD1 on Vδ2+ cell and the signal of TLR4 on CD4 T cell, as well as the presence of HLA-DR on Vδ2+ cell. The protein expression on the cell only groups (Group 1, 2, 3 and 4) serve as controls.\nThe pixel resolution for the different objective lens used will depend on the specific parameters and the confocal microscope being used.\nNote: The details about the objectives we used are shown below:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_594_7.csv\nTo acquire images with high quality, we recommend using the optimal setting of ZEN or relevant acquisition software during image capturing.\nScan at least 3 images for each group using 10× lens first.\nNote: Scanning images using 10× lens first is helpful to have a general view of the distribution of signals and to identify the cells of interest, which is a preliminary step before locating the scanning position using 40× or 63× lens.",
    "For experimental group 5 (unactivated γδ-T cell plus unstimulated CD4 T cell), group 6 (unactivated γδ-T cell plus pp65-stimulated CD4 T cell), group 7 (pp65-pulsed activated γδ-T cell plus unstimulated CD4 T cell) and group 8 (pp65-pulsed activated γδ-T cell plus pp65-stimulated CD4 T cell), scan at least five images per chamber using 40× or 63× oil lens. Scan at least five Z-stack images for group 8.\nNote: A resolution of at least 1024∗1024 is recommended but depends on the objective lens used. User should check the hardware parameters.\nNote: Sufficient number of images is helpful in a robust data quantification and analysis afterwards.\nNote: T-PMT should be turned off and the bright field should be excluded during Z-stack imaging. Setting the Z-position: decrease focus height until you cannot see the cell structure and set this as the first scanning position of the Z-position and increase focus height until you cannot see the cell structure and set as its last scanning position. Click “1 AU” hotkey to adjust pinhole size. Use the recommended parameters on frame size and resolution (click “Optimal” option) by the software. Use the scan speed recommended by the software.\nOptional: The condition we set is that Z-stack interval is 0.506 μm with 25 images acquired. The interval should be smaller than one airy unit. Smaller interval leads to slower scanning but higher resolution along the Z-axis. It should be adjusted to the resolution limit of the objective lens used. The number of acquired images depends on both the length of Z-position and the interval."
