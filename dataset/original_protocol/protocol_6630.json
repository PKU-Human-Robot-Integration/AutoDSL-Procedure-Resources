    "Preparation of bacterial cells for the inoculationBacterial cells grown on MOKA plates with appropriate antibiotics (i.e., Rifampicin 50 µg/mL here) are used to inoculate 5 mL of liquid MOKA medium (with same antibiotics) and grown overnight at 28°C under agitation at 200 rpm.Centrifuge 2 mL of bacterial preculture for 5 min at 6,000 rpm (i.e., 3.3 × g) and wash twice in 1 mM MgCl2. Resuspend in 1 mM MgCl2 and measure OD600nm.Prepare 1 mL of bacterial suspension in a 2-mL tube so that, for each strain, final OD600nm = 0.1 (i.e., 1 × 108 cfu/mL; note: this estimation has to be verified when working with other species by plating on solid medium) in 1 mM MgCl2.Dilute each suspension to 1/100 in a 5-mL tube to obtain a final inoculum at OD600nm = 0.001 (i.e., 1 × 106 cfu/mL) in 5 mL of 1 mM MgCl2. For the WT* reference strain, prepare 10 mL of suspension at OD600nm = 0.001 as it will be used in all mixes.Mix 2 mL of WT* suspension with 2 mL of each of the strains to test in another 5-mL tube (so that each mixed strain is at 5 × 105 cfu/mL, but the final concentration of the inoculum is 1 × 106 cfu/mL).InoculationUsing a blunt syringe filled with one milliliter of bacterial suspension, infiltrate the mesophyll of the 2nd true leaf of cauliflower (for pictures of the procedure, see Cohn et al., 2015). A large enough area should be infiltrated in order to later be able to sample a 6-mm leaf disc without taking any of the tissues damaged by the syringe. Typically, up to seven separate spots can be infiltrated on the same cauliflower leaf, thus allowing the inoculation of multiple strains or mixes on the same leaf.",
    "In this case, be careful to well separate infiltration areas to exclude cross-contamination.Circle the infiltrated area on the lower side of the leaf to mark the infected tissue for later sampling.Place the plants in the growth chamber and water them appropriately.Plating of the inoculation suspensions and counting of the initial relative frequencies in mixed populationsTransfer 100 µL of inoculation suspension into a 96-well plate with conical bottom.Perform serial 1/10 dilutions (10 µL in 90 µL of 1 mM MgCl2) using a multichannel pipette.Take 100 µL of dilution 10-3 and spread out them on round 92-mm MOKA plates containing the appropriate antibiotics (i.e., Rifampicin 50 µg/mL here) and fungicide (i.e., Pimaricin 30 µg/mL here) as well as X-Gluc 200 µM. In our case, spreading is performed by shaking using 4-mm glass beads until homogeneous repartition of the suspension.Incubate 4–5 days at 28°C to allow bacterial growth and blue staining of GUS-expressing colonies.Count blue and white colonies, e.g., using a hand-held colony counter, to determine the ratio of mixed strains at T0. This is necessary for proper normalization during later calculation of the CI (see Data analysis section).Sampling, plating, and counting of relative frequencies in mixed populations after incubationThree days after inoculation, sample mesophyll tissues by punching out a 6-mm leaf disc in the infiltrated area defined by the marker label and placing it in 200 µL of 1 mM MgCl2.Grind leaf samples using 4-mm glass beads in 2-mL tubes (2 beads per tube) using the beads-assisted grinder for 2 min at 30 Hz.Centrifuge shortly (5 s) the tubes containing the ground material to gather it at the bottom.Transfer 100 µL of ground tissue to a 96-well plate with conical bottom.Proceed as described in Steps C2 to C5.",
    "However, because each strain displays a different phenotype, and to ensure the presence of colonies from both strains, plate 50 µL of 10-2 and 10-3 dilutions.Note: Classically, we advise collecting bacterial titers by counting the plates displaying between 30 and 300 colonies. However, because competition assays require to finely determine the number of CFU for each of the mixed strains, we recommend counting plates where there are at least 100 colonies for mix-inoculated samples."
