    "Both minimally invasive (this protocol) and surgical preparations (Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.711#cpz1711-prot-0002]) allow for the collection of large blood volumes from rabbits. For minimally invasive procedures, the maximum blood volume collected within 2 weeks should not exceed 1% of the animal's body weight. For example, adult New Zealand white rabbits in the experiments detailed herein weigh approximately 2 to 6 kg. Therefore, 20 to 60 ml blood can be collected, respectively. If the maximum blood volume is collected at one sample point, an equal volume of warm isotonic fluids must be administered. The loss of large volumes of blood without replacement can lead to hypovolemic shock and anemia. It is good practice to administer isotonic fluids after each blood draw. In rabbits, blood samples can be collected from the marginal ear vein, central ear artery, lateral saphenous vein, cephalic vein, or jugular vein. The most accessible location for minimally invasive blood collection is the marginal ear vein (for relatively small volumes, or ∼1 ml) or central ear artery (for relatively large volumes, or several milliliters). Blood collection from the marginal ear vein, central ear artery, lateral saphenous vein, or cephalic vein can be conducted without anesthesia by trained individuals. However, blood sampling from animals under general anesthesia provides higher-quality samples with less stress on the animals.\nMaterials\n0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride (Cytiva, #Z1376)\n3.2% (w/v) sodium citrate (JT Baker, #3649-01; dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline, or PBS, Sigma-Aldrich, #D8537; store ≤1 year at room temperature)\nKetamine (40 mg/ml; Henry Schein, #056344)\nXylazine (5 mg/ml; Covetrus, #061035)\nNew Zealand white rabbit (2.0 to 3.5 kg; Charles River Laboratories)\nIsoflurane (1% to 3%; Covetrus, #029405)\n10-ml syringes (BD, #302995)\n1-ml syringes (BD, #309659)\n25-gauge hypodermic needles (BD, #305122)\nRecirculating heating pad (e.g., Gaymar Stryker T/Pump with recirculating heating pad)\nAnesthesia vaporizer, with nose cone",

Add 10 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride solution to a 10-ml syringe. Add 1 ml of 3.2% sodium citrate solution to a separate 10-ml syringe.\nThis volume is sufficient for a single 9-ml blood collection. Prepare the number of syringes necessary for the number of rabbits and the number of collections. The addition of sodium citrate coats the syringe with an anticoagulant to prevent premature platelet activation. The ratio of sodium citrate to blood is 1:10 (v/v).\n2. Based on the rabbit's weight, prepare the required volumes to administer the appropriate doses of ketamine (40 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg) in separate 1-ml syringes with a 25-gauge hypodermic needle.\nEnsure that there are no air bubbles and that the ketamine and xylazine fill the needles.\n3. Loosely restrain the New Zealand white rabbit on a table so its head is tucked under an arm. Grasp the rabbit's back leg with a hand. Inject the ketamine into the rabbit's thigh with the other hand. Then, inject the xylazine into the same thigh. Wait 15 min, until the rabbit is fully sedated and unresponsive to toe pinch.\nHolding the rabbit in this position comforts them as they seem to prefer dark spaces (under your arm) and ensures they will not jump out of your hold. Make sure to inject into muscle and avoid the femur. Additionally, verify that the needle is not in the vasculature by aspirating the syringe before injection. Monitor the rabbit as it becomes anesthetized to ensure it is breathing and its nose is not obstructed.",
    "4. Position the rabbit on a recirculating heating pad and place the nose cone connected to an anesthesia vaporizer over the rabbit's nose and mouth. Adjust the isoflurane concentration (1% to 3%) as necessary during the procedure to maintain adequate depth of anesthesia. Monitor vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature) every 15 min.\nPlacing the isoflurane nose cone on the rabbit before blood collection prevents premature gain of consciousness. Rabbits avoid the smell of isoflurane and may stop breathing, so it is critical to monitor the rabbit to prevent respiratory complications and death.\n5. Lay one of the ears flat on cotton gauze pads and remove the hair around the central ear artery by plucking the hair manually or with fine animal clippers. Wipe the ear with a disinfecting alcohol wipe.\nRemoving the hair creates a smooth surface and helps dilate the artery. The alcohol wipe also dilates the artery, making it easier to visualize and collect blood.\n6. Insert an angiocath PTFE IV catheter into the central ear artery and pull back on the internal needle to visualize blood. If blood is present, remove the inner needle. Keep the cannula in place with surgical tape.\nUsing this catheter prevents unwanted injury of the vessel resulting from movement of the needle. The central ear artery is located superficially near the surface of the ear. As a result, care must be taken to accurately insert the needle in the vessel. An extremely shallow insertion angle will ensure successful cannulation. The cannula will remain in the artery to allow for multiple blood draws without the need to reinsert a needle.",
    "7. Attach a three-way stopcock to the catheter luer adapter. To the stopcock, attach the 10-ml syringe filled with 0.9% sodium chloride solution (see step 1). Pull back on the plunger of this syringe to visualize the blood. Then, attach the 10-ml syringe containing 3.2% sodium citrate solution (see step 1) to the other port of the stopcock. Close the sodium chloride syringe port and collect 9 ml blood in the sodium citrate syringe (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.711#cpz1711-fig-0001]).\nThe blood will be collected to the 10-ml mark on the syringe, which will result in 9 ml blood plus 1 ml sodium citrate. If more than one blood collection is needed, remove the first 10-ml syringe and attach another.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a72a98ad-e865-4363-97c6-872a3fba7202/cpz1711-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nBlood collection via the central ear artery. After the cannula is flushed with saline, blood is allowed to flow back to the stopcock. The valve is then turned to allow the collection of blood into the second syringe filled with the appropriate amount of anticoagulant. Care should be taken to flush the stopcock after each collection to ensure patency of the cannula.\n8. Close the catheter port of the stopcock. Remove the blood-filled syringe. Flush the stopcock with 1 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride solution. Then, close off the port where the citrated blood syringe was and administer 10 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride through the IV catheter.\nIf a larger blood volume was collected, administer an equal volume of 0.9% sodium chloride.\n9. Pull back on the plunger of the 10-ml syringe filled with blood and sodium citrate to create an air pocket. Then, invert the syringe to mix the collected blood with the sodium citrate. Add 5 ml blood to a 5-ml polyethylene tube and 5 ml blood to another (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.711#cpz1711-fig-0002]).",
    "Adding 5 ml blood to separate tubes instead of a single tube will help with platelet isolation after centrifugation (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.711#cpz1711-prot-0003]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/362270a2-0872-4b29-be35-e6110a5943ac/cpz1711-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nWhole blood divided into equal 5-ml aliquots.\n10.

    "If the rabbit is to be euthanized at the end of the study, large volumes of blood can be collected under anesthesia. For these terminal procedures, blood can be collected via the method above (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.711#cpz1711-prot-0001]) or via the vena cava or a cardiac puncture. However, it is recommended to cannulate the jugular vein in terminal procedures if samples are to be collected at various time points under anesthesia.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.711#cpz1711-prot-0001])\nPolyethylene tubing (PE 90, Intramedic, #427426)\n21-gauge blunt stub adapter (BD, #427564)\nVeterinary hair clippers\n#10 scalpel blade and handle (Fine Science Tools; blade, #10010-00, and handle, #10003-12)\nHalsted-Mosquito hemostats (Fine Science Tools, #13008-12)\n3-0 braided silk sutures (Surgical Specialties, #SP118)\nVannas scissors (Fine Science Tools, #15018-10)\n1.

Monitor the rabbit as it becomes anesthetized to ensure it is breathing and its nose is not obstructed.",
    "3. Connect 6 in. of polyethylene tubing to the 21-gauge blunt stub adapter. Connect a three-way stopcock to the luer adapter of the blunt needle.\nThe tubing will be used to cannulate the jugular and collect blood.\n4. Fill 10-ml syringe(s) with 0.9% sodium chloride. Add 1 ml of 3.2% sodium citrate to the same number of separate 10-ml syringe(s).\nSodium citrate is added and coats the syringe with an anticoagulant to prevent premature clotting. The ratio of sodium citrate to blood is 1:10. Prepare the number of syringes necessary for the number of rabbits and the number of collections.\n5. Connect a 10-ml syringe filled with 0.9% sodium chloride to the stopcock. Push in the plunger to fill the stopcock, blunt needle, and tubing with the saline.\nMake sure there are no air bubbles in the tubing, blunt needle, or stopcock. This tubing/blunt needle/stopcock/saline syringe combination will be used to cannulate the jugular and collect blood.\n6. Using veterinary hair clippers, remove the fur from the neck of the rabbit from under the jaw to the top of the clavicle.\nThis area will be the surgical site for isolating the jugular vein.\n7. Position the rabbit on a recirculating heating pad and place the nose cone connected to an anesthesia vaporizer over the rabbit's nose and mouth. Adjust the isoflurane concentration (1% to 3%) as necessary during the procedure to maintain adequate depth of anesthesia. Monitor vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature) every 15 min.\nPlacing the isoflurane nose cone on the rabbit before blood collection prevents premature gain of consciousness. Rabbits avoid the smell of isoflurane and may stop breathing, so it is critical to monitor the rabbit to prevent respiratory complications and death.",
    "8. Make a 2-in. midline incision in the neck with a scalpel (i.e., a #10 scalpel blade and handle). Use Halsted-Mosquito hemostats to dissect the internal jugular vein from the muscle and surrounding connective tissue.\nEither the left or the right jugular vein may be isolated. Experience with blunt dissection is required, and practice may be necessary to master this technique. Care must be taken to avoid disruption or injury to the common carotid artery and the vagus nerve.\n9. Tie two 3-0 braided silk sutures loosely around the jugular vein. Place one suture in a cephalic position and one in a caudal position. Tie the top cephalic suture tight. Leave the caudal suture loose.\nThe cephalic suture is tight so that blood is not lost in the next step due to retrograde flow. The lower suture will be used to hold the cannula in place. Carefully position the suture in a manner that avoids minor branches to avoid bleeding from the cannulation site.\n10. Using Vannas scissors, make a small incision in the jugular vein that is large enough to insert the tubing but small enough not to cut through the vessel completely. Slide the cannula inside the vein toward the heart, ∼1 in. Secure the suture around the vein with the cannula inside (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.711#cpz1711-fig-0003]).\nThere should be little or no resistance on the cannula when advancing it into the vein. Do not force it, or the vein could be damaged. Carefully adjust the position of the cannula until it is easily advanced 1 in. Securing the cannula with a suture will prevent accidental removal during blood collection.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ed8667e8-d1b9-49d4-910f-2c5899e99590/cpz1711-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3",
    "Completed surgical preparation. The endotracheal tube (top) is connected to the anesthesia vaporizer. The jugular cannula (bottom) is exposed using fine forceps to demonstrate the approximate location of the suture.\n11. Pull back on the syringe plunger to visualize blood. Then, fill the stopcock with blood and attach a 10-ml syringe filled with 1 ml of 3.2% sodium citrate (see step 4). Adjust the valve on the stopcock to the collection syringe and collect 9 ml blood.\nThis will ensure suitable blood collection. If collection is difficult, adjust the cannula slightly until blood flows easily. If >10 ml blood is needed, remove the first syringe and attach another.\n12. Close the catheter port of the stopcock. Remove the blood-filled syringe. Flush the stopcock with 1 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride solution (see step 4). Then, close off the port where the citrated blood syringe was previously located and administer 10 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride through the venous catheter.\nIf a larger blood volume was collected, administer an equal volume of 0.9% sodium chloride.\n13. Aspirate the 10-ml syringe filled with blood and sodium citrate to create an air pocket. Invert the syringe to mix the collected blood with the sodium citrate. Add 5 ml blood to one 5-ml polyethylene tube and 5 ml to another (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.711#cpz1711-fig-0002]).\nAdding 5 ml blood to separate tubes instead of a single tube will help with platelet isolation after centrifugation (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.711#cpz1711-prot-0003]).\n14.

    "Platelet reactivity can be determined in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) obtained from whole blood samples (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.711#cpz1711-prot-0001] and Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.711#cpz1711-prot-0002]) using light transmission aggregometry. This protocol is specific for assessing ex vivo platelet aggregation via a four-channel aggregometer (Chrono-log Corporation Model 700). About 10 ml whole blood is required for this experiment. The agonists used in this protocol depend greatly on the molecular target of the therapeutic agent of interest. For P2Y12 antagonists, ADP-induced platelet aggregation is inhibited, and therefore, the platelet response to ADP needs to be determined. Additionally, platelets’ response to agonists that are not inhibited should be examined to verify that platelets respond normally to other activators. For P2Y12 antagonists, the response to arachidonic acid and/or collagen should be used as a positive control because these activate platelets through P2Y12-independent mechanisms for platelet aggregation. The following protocol assesses platelet reactivity in blood from animals treated with a P2Y12 antagonist. Therefore, ADP, arachidonic acid, and collagen are used.\nMaterials\nAnticoagulated whole blood (e.g., 10 ml from Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.711#cpz1711-prot-0001] or Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.711#cpz1711-prot-0002])\nAgonists:\n               \nADP (Chrono-log, #P/N 384)\nArachidonic acid (Chrono-log, #P/N 390)\nCollagen (Chrono-log, #P/N 385)\nBenchtop centrifuge (Thermo Fisher Sorvall Legend X1R, #75004261, or similar)\nTransfer pipets (Fisherbrand, #13-711-9A)\n5-ml polyethylene tubes (VWR, #16465-262)\nAggregometer (Chrono-log® Model 700 four-channel aggregometer)\nCuvettes (Chrono-log, #P/N 312)\nStir bar (Chrono-log, #P/N 311)\nKimwipes\n1.

Aspirate the entire PRP layer with a transfer pipet and place it into a separate 5-ml polyethylene tube (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.711#cpz1711-fig-0004]).\nThe supernatant is the PRP, which is collected in a separate tube.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/31233d3c-96be-433a-a2ae-9cc1fa672a67/cpz1711-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4",
    "Whole blood, platelet-rich plasma (PRP), and platelet-poor plasma (PPP). After the first centrifugation step, the PRP supernatant is removed and transferred to a new vial (second vial from right). The remaining pellet undergoes a second centrifugation step. The resulting PPP supernatant is removed and transferred to a new vial (first vial on the right), leaving behind the cellular components as the pellet (two tubes on the left).\n2. Centrifuge the remaining non-PRP pellet for 10 min at 1500 × g at room temperature. Aspirate the platelet-poor plasma (PPP) layer with a new transfer pipet and place it into a separate 5-ml polyethylene tube.\nThe supernatant is the PPP, which is collected in a separate tube. Discard the remaining pellet.\n3. Turn on the aggregometer and allow it to warm up for 10 min. Place cuvette(s) in the incubation wells. Add stir bar(s) to the cuvette(s) being used for PRP agonist-induced aggregation. Wait ∼3 min for the PRP cuvette(s) to warm.\nThe number of cuvettes depends on the numbers of samples and agonists you will use. Allocate one cuvette per agonist and an additional cuvette for the PPP background control. The PPP background-control cuvette does not need a stir bar.\nSpecific details on operating the aggregometer can be found in the manufacturer's instructions. A brief description is outlined below.\n4. Mix the PRP by end-over-end inversion. Add 500 μl PRP to a pre-warmed cuvette (with a stir bar) for each channel. Place in the incubation well for 3 min.\nMixing needs to be done gently so that the platelets are not activated. Mixing is essential to ensure that the platelets are equally distributed in the liquid and not settled at the bottom.",
    "5. Add 500 μl PPP to another cuvette. Wipe the outside with a Kimwipe. Place the PPP cuvette in the channel 1 PPP position (without a stir bar).\nIf the cuvette has fingerprints or dirt on it, this will result in an incorrect reading. The PPP does not have platelets, so a stir bar is not necessary.\n6. Similarly, wipe the pre-warmed 500 μl PRP cuvette(s) from step 4 with a Kimwipe and place in the channels of interest.\nEach channel should be set to OPTICAL aggregation mode.\n7. Follow software instructions for zeroing each aggregation channel.\nLight transmission should be as close to 0% as possible, but samples with a 4% error are acceptable. If channels are not stable, press and hold the BASELINE button and then release. This can be done multiple times until stable. If stability does not occur after five tries, remove the cuvette and re-wipe with a Kimwipe.\n8. Open a new assay window and click on the START button for Trace 1. Add an agonist (ADP, arachidonic acid, or collagen) and close the test door. Repeat this step for all channels. Wait 8 min and then click STOP.\nA new assay window is necessary for analyzing the data later. Platelet aggregation is complete after 8 min, but the program will continue to run if you do not stop it.\nFor rabbit platelets, ADP (20 μM), arachidonic acid (500 μM), and collagen (2 μg/ml) are used to assess changes in platelet aggregation. Arachidonic acid must be vortexed for 2 min after thawing and then briefly before use. The agonists used depend on the antiplatelet/antithrombotic drug of interest.\n9. Save the test and discard the cuvettes.\nRepeat steps 3 to 9 for additional samples.",
    "The aggregometer indirectly evaluates platelet aggregation by determining light transmission through the PRP. Resting PRP is turbid and is assigned 0% relative light transmission in step 7. As platelets aggregate, they form small dense clumps, which reduces the turbidity of PRP and increases light transmission (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.711#cpz1711-fig-0004]). Therefore, PPP represents maximal light transmission and is used by the instrument (step 5) to calculate the relative light transmission of activated PRP. Naïve and vehicle-treated rabbits typically achieve ∼80% light transmission after stimulation with 20 μM ADP, demonstrating normal platelet aggregation. Clopidogrel-treated rabbits will only achieve 20% to 60% light transmission, which is inversely proportional to the dose administered and is representative of an inhibited platelet aggregation response (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.711#cpz1711-fig-0005]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4be8562c-ff47-4359-b354-71e8a83248d6/cpz1711-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nRepresentative platelet aggregation responses to ADP (20 μM) from rabbits treated with vehicle (gray), clopidogrel (blue; 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, or 10.0 mg/kg), and ticagrelor (red; 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mg/kg).

    "Assessing platelet activation via flow cytometry is useful when small volumes of blood need to be analyzed. Flow cytometry can evaluate platelet function in as little as 1 ml whole blood. This method is useful when assessing several time points to remain under the maximum blood collection volume limitations. Unlike assessment of platelet aggregation via light transmission aggregometry (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.711#cpz1711-prot-0003]), assessment of platelet activation by flow cytometry detects P-selectin and integrin αIIbβ3 surface expression.

Add 50 µl of 20 µM ADP to a separate polypropylene tube. Then, add 50 µl HBS to another polypropylene tube.\nThese tubes will be used to assess the activation of platelets (ADP) against control unactivated platelets (HBS).\n3. Add 450 µl whole blood to the ADP tube and 450 µl to the HBS tube. Swirl gently to mix. Incubate for 2 min at room temperature.\nDuring this time, the platelets are activated by the ADP.\n4. Add 5 µl of the blood-ADP mixture to the four tubes labeled with ADP (see steps 1b, 1d, 1f, and 1h). Then, add 5 µl of the blood-HBS mixture to the unactivated sample tubes (see steps 1a, 1c, 1e, and 1g). Swirl gently to mix.\n5. Add 1 µl fibrinogen-FITC (0.17 mg/ml) to the appropriate sample tubes (see steps 1c, 1d, 1g, and 1h). Swirl gently to mix. Incubate for 15 min at room temperature.\nPlace fibrinogen-FITC at 37°C for ≥30 min before ensuring that it is dissolved. Once fibrinogen-FITC is added, protect the tubes from light.\n6. Add 1 ml of 1% PFA to each tube from step 1. Swirl gently to mix. Incubate for 15 min on ice.\nMake the 1% PFA on the day of use and store it on ice. This step fixes the platelets.\nContinue to protect the tubes from light.\n7. Add 1 ml DPBS to each tube. Vortex the tubes to mix. Then, centrifuge all tubes for 10 min at 1000 × g, 4°C.\nThis washes the platelets to get rid of excess antibodies. It is safe to vortex the samples because they have been fixed.",
    "8. Discard the supernatant.\nThe platelets will remain at the bottom.\n9. Resuspend the pellet in the tubes from steps 1a to 1d with 50 µl HBS. Resuspend the pellet for the tubes from steps 1e to 1h with 46 µl HBS.\nThe tubes from steps 1e to 1h will receive anti-CD62P-AF647 in the next step, which is why the pellet is resuspended in less volume.\n10. Add 4 µl (0.5 µg/ml final concentration) anti-CD62P-AF647 to the appropriate tubes (from steps 1e to 1h). Incubate for 15 min at room temperature.\nProtect the tubes from light.\n11. Add 1 ml DPBS to each tube from step 1. Vortex the tubes to mix. Then, centrifuge all tubes for 10 min at 1000 × g, 4°C.\nThis washes the platelets to remove unbound fibrinogen/antibody.\n12. Discard the supernatant.\nThe platelets will remain at the bottom.\n13. Resuspend the pellet in 500 µl DPBS. Vortex to mix.\nIt is safe to vortex the samples at this stage because the cells have been fixed.\n14. Analyze samples using a flow cytometer and associated software (e.g., an Accuri C6 flow cytometer and CFlow Plus v1.0.227.04.\nEvents (20,000) should be collected on a log scale for FSC-A and SSC-A and gated on the platelet scatter-based population, followed by doublet discrimination. Quadrant gates for fibrinogen-FITC- and anti-CD62P-AF647-positive events are generated based on ADP-activated FMO controls (see steps 1d and 1f) prepared for each animal and time point. Double-positive (CD62P+, fibrinogen+) platelets are quantified as a measure of platelet activation.",
    "For the purposes of evaluating the efficacy of antiplatelet drugs, α-granule secretion and the formation of integrin αIIbβ3 in rabbit platelets can be measured by flow cytometry. Determining α-granule secretion is accomplished by the measurement of P-selectin (CD62P) expression on the platelet surface. P-selectin is a transmembrane protein that is stored in the α-granules of inactivated platelets and plays an important role in aggregation and the recruitment of platelets to sites of vascular injury. Upon activation, platelets degranulate, which results in flipping of the α-granule membrane, exposing the inner surface of the granule to the extracellular environment and thereby promoting platelet-platelet binding (Jurk & Kehrel, 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.711#cpz1711-bib-0010]). In this protocol, a commercially available, fluorescently conjugated anti-CD62P antibody is used to detect P-selectin expression.\nIntegrin αIIbβ3 expression is also used as a marker of platelet activation. Agonist-mediated platelet activation results in an increase in intracellular calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum. The increase in calcium triggers the association of integrins αIib and β3. This complex is capable of binding fibrinogen, which promotes stabilization of platelet aggregates (Feuston, Culberson, & Hartman, 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.711#cpz1711-bib-0007]). Although antibodies have been developed to detect this complex on the cell surface of platelets in other species (mouse and human), we have been unable to identify commercially available antibodies that reliably detect active integrin αIIbβ3 in rabbits. As a consequence, we have developed alternative antibody-free methods for detecting the expression of this integrin. Here, we describe the use of a fluorescently labeled ligand (fibrinogen-FITC) as a probe for detecting platelet activation. Platelet activation results in increased binding of fibrinogen-FITC to platelets, which can be subsequently detected by flow cytometry.",
    "To comprehensively evaluate platelet function, we simultaneously determine the CD62P+ and fibrinogen-FITC+ cell populations. In doing so, we can evaluate both degranulation and integrin αIIbβ3 activation, respectively. Using dual-fluorescence flow cytometry, we can then determine the number of double-positive (CD62P+, fibrinogen+) cells. Figure 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.711#cpz1711-fig-0006] illustrates representative scatter plots from three individual animals treated with vehicle (Fig. 6A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.711#cpz1711-fig-0006]), 10 mg/kg clopidogrel (Fig. 6B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.711#cpz1711-fig-0006]), and 3 mg/kg ticagrelor (Fig. 6C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.711#cpz1711-fig-0006]). P-selectin-expressing cells are plotted along the y-axis, and integrin αIIbβ3-expressing cells are plotted along the x-axis. Cells expressing both markers will appear in the upper right quadrant of the scatter plot, indicating positivity on both axes. Treatment with clopidogrel or ticagrelor dose dependently decreases both α-granule secretion and the formation of integrin αIIbβ3 on platelets in response to ADP activation compared to vehicle (Fig. 6D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.711#cpz1711-fig-0006]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d2cccd4c-c564-4521-a12a-161381987e4d/cpz1711-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\nRepresentative flow cytometric assessment of platelets activated with ADP.

    "Rabbits are entirely covered in fur, which makes it challenging to determine the bleeding time on the skin. A simple tail amputation in mice does not translate well in rabbits due to anatomical differences. One location on the rabbit that is not covered in fur is the tongue. Therefore, an incision in the tongue is used to evaluate the bleeding risk of antiplatelet therapeutics. Surgicutt® devices are used to create a uniform, 5-mm-long by 1-mm-deep incision on the upper surface of the tongue of a rabbit. The edge of this incision can then be carefully blotted with filter paper every 10 s until the bleeding has stopped. The elapsed time from the creation of the tongue incision to the cessation of bleeding is considered the tongue bleeding time. We have found that bleeding time can be assessed at up to three different time points/locations on the tongue while the rabbit is under anesthesia. Due to injury to the tongue, this is a terminal procedure.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.711#cpz1711-prot-0001])\nEndotracheal tube (2.5-mm ID; Jorvet, #J149T)\nSurgicutt® Bleeding Time Device (Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.711#cpz1711-fig-0007]; Jorvet, #J0522S)\nStopwatch\nWhatman cellulose filter paper (25-mm circle; Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.711#cpz1711-fig-0007]; Whatman, #1004-125)\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/71b34ab2-8743-4f84-a0e6-2fd34f8939e2/cpz1711-fig-0007-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 7\nThe Surgicutt® device (left) with filter paper (right).\n1. Based on the rabbit's weight, draw up the required amounts of ketamine (40 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg) in separate 1-ml syringes with a 25-gauge hypodermic needle.\nEnsure that there are no air bubbles and that the ketamine and xylazine fill the needles.",
    "2. Loosely restrain the rabbit on a table so its head is tucked under an arm. Grasp the rabbit's back leg with a hand. Inject the ketamine into the rabbit's thigh with the other hand. Then inject the xylazine into the same thigh. Wait 15 min until the rabbit is fully sedated and unresponsive to toe pinch.\nHolding the rabbit in this position comforts them as they seem to prefer dark spaces (under your arm) and ensures they will not jump out of your hold. Make sure to inject into muscle and avoid the femur. Additionally, verify that the needle is not in the vasculature by aspirating the syringe before injection. Monitor the rabbit as it becomes anesthetized to ensure its nose is not obstructed.\n3. Position the rabbit on a recirculating heating pad and use a scalpel to make a 2-in. midline incision on top of the trachea. Use blunt hemostats to dissect the trachea.\n4. Loosely tie a single suture around the trachea in a caudal position. Using the scalpel, make a small lateral incision between two tracheal cartilage rings. Insert the endotracheal tube and secure it with the suture (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.711#cpz1711-fig-0003]). Connect the other end of the endotracheal tube to the anesthesia vaporizer. Adjust the isoflurane concentration (1% to 3%) as necessary during the procedure to maintain adequate depth of anesthesia.\nMonitor vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature) every 15 min.\n5. Place the Surgicutt® Bleeding Time Device on top of the tongue, as close as possible to the tip, while gently grasping with gauze (Fig. 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.711#cpz1711-fig-0008]). Release the blade by pushing the activator.",
    "This step needs to be practiced, making sure the pressure on the tongue is the same among animals. The Surgicutt® should have good contact with the tongue but not be pushed down with pressure. Too much pressure could cause the Surgicutt® to cut deeper than 1 mm.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/36fdff89-01d2-4c90-b470-8a6c8c07a297/cpz1711-fig-0008-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 8\nThe rabbit's tongue is held securely with gauze while the Surgicutt® device is placed firmly on the upper surface.\n6. Start a stopwatch. Carefully blot the edges of the incision with Whatman cellulose filter paper every 10 s without disturbing the incision (Fig. 9[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.711#cpz1711-fig-0009]).\nBe careful not to disrupt the clotting process. Do not touch the incision with the filter paper; rather, blot directly next to it. If the incision is blotted, this will artificially extend the bleeding time.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/af4011d7-b98d-469f-8004-0aaa897d8104/cpz1711-fig-0009-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 9\nFilter paper is used to carefully blot the edge of the incision to remove excess blood every 10 s.\n7. Stop the stopwatch when blood is no longer present on the filter paper (Fig. 10[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.711#cpz1711-fig-0010]). Record the time.\nThe tongue bleeding time is considered the interval from when the incision was created to when blood was no longer apparent.\nAlthough absolute bleeding times are often used to evaluate the negative effects of novel antiplatelet drugs, it is often useful to collect a baseline bleeding time prior to the administration of treatment. One benefit of the rabbit tongue bleeding time test is that it allows for repeated measures within the same animal, whereas rodent tail bleeding assays are restricted to a single time point. In this situation, drug effect data may be presented as a relative bleeding time compared to the pre-treatment baseline. This experimental design also allows for the use of paired statistical evaluation methods.",
    "In Figure 11[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.711#cpz1711-fig-0011], we demonstrate the effects of two widely prescribed antiplatelet agents on the tongue bleeding time. Treatment with therapeutic doses of clopidogrel (10 mg/kg; 216.86% ± 29.92%) and ticagrelor (3 mg/kg; 241.14% ± 23.05%) significantly prolongs bleeding times compared to vehicle (92.71% ± 6.35%). Here, the data are presented as relative change compared to baseline, where 100% (indicated by a horizontal dotted line) represents no change.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/04623f8a-2aef-4ce3-9ef9-48fdd4b769c9/cpz1711-fig-0010-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 10\nThe rabbit's tongue after bleeding has ceased.
