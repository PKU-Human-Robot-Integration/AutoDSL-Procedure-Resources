    "This procedure is in accordance with Cedars-Sinai IACUC requirements. Investigators should ensure institutional IACUC compliance prior to proceeding. All tools and reagents should be sterilized prior to use.\n1. Preparation of Tools, Solutions, and DNA Mixture\nInsert 100-mm fire polished borosilicate glass capillary tubes into a micropipette puller. Set heating to allow for standard weighted pull to form pipette tip of approximately 17.5 mm. Cut tips with sharp surgical scissors at a distance approximately 8-9 mm from the beginning of the tip to create roughly a 100 µm diameter opening.\nMake a stock 1% w/v fast green solution by mixing filtered nuclease-free water (utilizing a 20-μm syringe filter) with dry fast green.\nIsolate purified endotoxin-free plasmid DNA that is highly concentrated (i.e. > 3 μg/μl), diluted in Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer. Add desired amounts of plasmid to mixture diluted in TE buffer and add a 1:10 ratio of the 1% fast green solution (making a 0.1% w/v final concentration of fast green). Use a 0.5-2.0 µg/µl final concentration of plasmid for robust expression of transgenes.\n2. Animal Anesthesia, Pipette Loading, and Pial Surface Plasmid Injection\nInduce hypothermia anesthesia on 1-2 day postnatal mice by placing them on a Petri dish that is placed on ice for 5-8 min (time dependent on pup age/weight). Once hypothermia is confirmed by lack of movement from toe-pinching and/or tail reflex, mice are ready to be injected.  Place animals back on ice if pain reflexes are evident.  The injection procedure and electroporation take less than 2-3 min in total so time the hypothermia, injection, and electroporation procedures accordingly to maintain appropriate anesthesia.",
    "During anesthesia, using a standard pipette, carefully pipette desired amount of plasmid mix to be injected (0.5-2 μl) onto a piece of paraffin wax film for reference. Here, a total volume of 0.5 µl of plasmid mix is injected. Next, using a micro injector, carefully insert assembled glass capillary pipette into tube containing plasmid mixture. Take extra precaution to prevent the tip from breaking by making sure it does not touch the edges of the tube. Aspirate the solution into the pipette by slowly dialing back the transfer dial. Once a sufficient volume has been loaded into the pipette, dial forward until the pressure returns to the neutral position of 0 hPa.\nUsing 300-450 hPa pressure for injection to ensure appropriate pressure for even filling of the pial surface/meningeal space, place the tip nearby the pipetted paraffin wax film reference injection (from 2.2) and use the foot pedal from the micro injector to eject one volume onto the paraffin wax film. Adjust pressure accordingly until the amount ejected equals the previously pipetted reference volume.\nOnce the tip has been equilibrated and anesthesia has been confirmed, pups are ready to be injected.",
    "The goal of the experiment is to inject the plasmid mix under the skull and above the pial surface to allow for DNA electroporation downwards into the pial surface progenitors (Figure 1A). For cortex injections, hold the pup down using the thumb and index finger of the less dominant hand. The cortical hemispheres and other superficial structures such as the superior colliculi are visible between P0 and P2, allowing for facile targeting of these structures (Figure 1B). Using the dominant hand and target desired region of cortex (i.e. motor, somatosensory, etc.), insert pipette past the skin and skull taking care to avoid cerebral arteries. Make sure to prevent any further penetration of the tip past the skull (which is indicated by the lack of further resistance just after piercing the skull).\nInject plasmid solution using the foot pedal of the micro injector and make sure it disperses evenly across the tissue (Figure 2A).\n\tNote: It is very important to empirically determine an approach that maximizes plasmid delivery while avoiding hematoma due to fluid pressure. This can be done by adjusting the duration of the injection, the angle, the volume, and the precise target site to avoid vascular disruption.\nBe sure to try and keep the tip from drying in between injections by placing the tip in test droplets from injections made previously on wax paper or plastic paraffin film. This is required to prevent tip accumulation of evaporated and crystalized DNA solution, which can result in the clogging of the tip and inconsistent delivery volumes.\n3. Electroporation",
    "Set the Electroporator to 135-150 V for five pulses, lasting 50 msec, with 950 msec intervals in between each pulse. In order to increase conductance and prevent burning of the skin, cover 3-mm platinum tweezertrodes with electroporation gel. Check for toe-pinching and tail reflexes at this point to ensure anesthesia.  If responsive, place on ice for several minutes to anesthetize.\nFor cortex (and superior colliculus) injections, employ a 3-mm electrode (Figure 2B) to increase viability of pups (as compared with the 7- and 10-mm electrodes, which are used for ventricular zone electroporation). Place the negatively charged probe of the electrode over the injected area and the positively charged probe around the contralateral region below the eye such that the electrode orientation is at a 45-60° angle relative to the midline (Figure 2C).\nUse the foot pedal of the electroporator to trigger current and hold tweezertrodes in place for 3-5 pulses, depending on pup age and weight, effectively targeting DNA into underlying pial surface cells when accounting for curvature of the hemispheres.\n\tNote: The negative pole can be swept over the injection area in between pulses or a larger electrode can be employed to increase the electroporated area.\nImmediately after electroporation, carefully clean off gel from pups and place them under a heat lamp for approximately 5 min.\nPups will acutely lose their natural reddish-pink hue in the minutes after electroporation due to cyanosis. Observe the pups for the recovery of natural color and the initiation of normal movement before returning them to their cages.",
    "Ensure re-socialization with the mother by observing whether she brings the pups back to the nest and begins grooming them. If she becomes aggressive, make sure pups don't have remnants of gel and incubate them with some of the bedding to transfer the smell to the pups.\n4. Modifications for Targeting the Superior Colliculi\nTargeting:\nInject the superior colliculus in the same fashion as the cortex but note that the target region lies just posterior and lateral to lambda and roughly at the midline (Figures 3A and 3B). With successful injections, the plasmid mix naturally fills the contours of the superior colliculus. Once injections have been made successfully, animals are ready for electroporation.\nElectroporation:\nIn a very similar fashion, for superior colliculus injections, place the negatively charged probe of the electrode over the injected area and the positively charged probe around the eye, snout or chin, driving DNA into the superficial regions of the superior colliculus (Figure 3C). In this case, the electrode orientation is at a 25-40° angle relative to the midline.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
