    "Note: All procedures were performed on adult female Sprague Dawley rats (~200 g) in compliance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at SUNY-Stony Brook and Northport VAMC. After pre-training on the behavioral tasks, rats were deeply anesthetized with 3% isoflurane in 100% O2 in an induction chamber (1 L). Anesthesia was maintained by administering 1.5% isoflurane in 100% O2 through a face mask. A water circulating heating pad was used to maintain body temperature at 36.5-37 °C during surgeries.Before surgery, animals received a subcutaneous injection of analgesic Buprenorphine (0.01 mg/kg) to reduce post-operative pain. Petrolatum ophthalmic ointment was applied to the eyes to prevent desiccation. Dorsal laminectomy (i.e. partial vertebral laminectomy) was performed to expose T10 spinal segment. The spinal level was confirmed by using a vein at T5-T6 as a landmark. The meningeal layer at T10 was slit (1 mm) at the midline longitudinally.A complete transection of the left hemicord at T10 was carried out with the tip of iridectomy scissors, as follows:First, while holding the dura and lifting the spinal cord slightly, one tip of the scissors was passed through the entire thickness of the spinal cord dorsal to ventral at the midline; The left dorsal and ventral columns were then cut from lateral to the midline by closing other tip of scissors; Finally, while keeping the cord elevated, one tip of the scissors was placed under the ventral surface of the spinal cord (up to the midline) and any uncut tissue in the left dorsal and ventral columns was cut ventral to dorsal up to the midline. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20130918/20130918005336_2065.jpgFigure 1.

    "Image of rat brain and spinal cord isolated from the rat that recived HX spinal cord injury (at arrow) 6 weeks erlier.After surgery, the muscles were closed with 4-0 monocryl suture and skin was closed with wound clips. Antibiotic (5 mg/kg, sc) and 5 ml of lactated Ringer’s solution were administered subcutaneously. Bladder function was not compromised by this surgery. Injections of antibiotic, analgesic and Ringer`s solution were administered for 3 days post injury. Horizontal or transverse sections of the spinal cord were used for reconstruction of injury (Figure 2). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20130918/20130918004954_0310.jpgFigure 2.

Transverse section of the cord at SCI epicenter prepared 6 weeks after HX; highlighted is area of spared white matter. Scale bar, 100 μm. (Adopted and modified from Garcia-Alias et al., 2011).As a result of HX SCI, there are clear behavioral impairments revealed by challenging motor tasks and automated Catwalk gait analysis; electrophysiological experiments allow evaluation of the conduction through fibers contralateral to the lesion and the possibility of establishing a functional detour around the lesion following administration of various treatments; moreover, unilateral injections of the anatomical tracers permit visualization of anerogradely labeled midline crossing fibers and retrogradely labeled neurons (Arvanian et al., 2009; Hunanyan et al., 2010; Schnell et al., 2011; Garcia-Alias et al., 2011; Hunanyan et al., 2011; Petrosyan et al., 2013)."
