    "The animal procedures are performed following approved protocols of the National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Approval to conduct the study is granted by the Animal Care and Ethics Committee (CICUAL) of INIMEC-CONICET-UNC (Resolution numbers 014/2017 B and 006/2017 A).\n1. Primary rat cortical neuron cultures\nAnesthetize E18 Wistar pregnant rats in a CO2 chamber with a mixture of 80% CO2/20% O2 for 60 s of exposure and then sacrifice then by dislocate the cervical vertebrae.\nPerform the following steps in a laminar flow hood. Extract encephalon from the embryos with a forceps style # 3 and straight sharp small spring scissors (Table of Materials) to Hanks solution in cell culture dishes.\nDissect the tissue under 20x magnifying glass, using two fine-tipped forceps style #5, separating the frontal cortex from the meninges. Transfer the frontal cortex to a 15 mL conical tube and incubate the tissue with 3-4 mL of Trypsin-EDTA (0.25%) for 15 min, at 37 °C for chemical digestion.\nAfter digestion, dilute it with 3-4mL of Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) plus 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Then wash it 3 times with Ca2+/Mg2+ free Hanks Balanced Salt solution and 0.1% glucose by centrifugation (3000 g for 5 min).\nMechanically dissociate the tissue 10 times by pipetting up and down using a 1000 µL tip, in DMEM plus 10% FCS (Table of Materials). Then centrifuge the homogenate at 100 x g for 1 min, collect the supernatant and complete the remaining volume to 1000 µL.",
    "Plate the cell suspension on cell culture dishes at a density of 520 cell/mm2 with 2 mL of DMEM containing 10% FCS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 1% of an essential aminoacid additive (see Table of Material). Then incubate at 37 °C in a humidified environment with 5% CO2 for 2 h.\n\t\nOrganic matter removal and poly-L-lysine coating of cell culture dishes\n\t\t\nRemove the organic matter by placing the glass material in a reaction chamber and add 96% ethyl alcohol to just about cover the material. Then add 68% (w/v) nitric acid drop by drop until brownish-greenish bubbles start to appear. Once this happens, partially cover the container and allow the reaction to continue until explosion ceases.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Remove the organic matter under a gas extraction cabin to avoid exposure to noxious gases.\nBefore poly-L-lysine coating, rinse the glasses with sterile Mili-Q water about ten times. Then incubate the culture glasses and dishes with 0.1 μg/μL poly-L-lysine for 4 h before using them. After incubation, rinse the glasses with sterile Mili-Q water about ten times.\nTo allow neural cell differentiation, change the medium for a serum-free neurobasal medium, with the serum-free supplement (Table of Materials). Keep cultures at 37 °C with 5% CO2 until treatment.\n2. Lentivirus production\nNOTE: The oligonucleotides containing the sequences targeting the 3'UTRs of either the CN-Aα isoform or CHOP and with the non-targeting sequences (scrambles) are listed in Table 1.\nFor annealing, mix two single-stranded oligonucleotides with complementary sequences in equal molar amounts, using Annealing Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5-8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA).",
    "Heat at 95 °C for 2 min and then cool slowly by transferring samples from the heat block or water bath to a bench-top at room temperature. Dilute the resulting product [short hairpin RNA, (shRNA) with cohesive ends] to a final concentration of 0.5 µM, aliquot them and store at -20 °C.\nClone the shRNA insert into lentiviral vector pLKO.3G, with GFP as a green fluorescent marker. For this, digest 1 µg of vector with EcoRI and PacI restriction enzymes by mixing the following in a sterile tube: 2 µL of 10x restriction enzyme buffer (100 mM bis-Tris propane-HCl, pH 6.5, 100 mM MgCl2, 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin), 1 µL of 1 µg/µL pLKO.3G, 0.5 µL of 10 U/µL ECoRI, 0.5 µL of PacI (10 U/µL), and 16 µL of sterile ionized water.\n\t\nMix gently by pipetting. Incubate the reaction for 3-4 h at 37 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Overnight digestions are generally unnecessary and may result in DNA degradation.\nFor ligation, mix the digested vector and insert in a molar ratio of 3:1 and incubate it with the T4 ligase and ligase buffer (provided by manufacturer) overnight at 16 °C.\n\tNOTE: At this point ligation reaction can be stored at 4 °C until further use.\nTransform DH5α competent cells (Table of Materials) or another suitable E. coli strain with the ligation reaction as follows.\n\t\nMix competent E. coli with the total volume of ligation reaction and chill it on ice for 15 min, place it in a 42 °C bath for 2 min and then chill it on ice again for 15 min.",
    "Transfer the total volume subjected to heat shock to a 15 mL tube and complete the volume to 1000 µL with Luria-Bertani (LB) liquid medium that has been previously maintained at 37 °C. Shake the bacteria for 90 min at 37 °C in an orbital shaker at approximately 330 rpm.\nCentrifuge them at 5,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and discard 900 µL of supernatant. Use the remaining supernatant to resuspend the pellet. Spread bacteria suspension evenly over a solid ampicillin (100 µg/mL) LB plate.\nIncubate at 37 °C overnight, then check bacterial growth. At this point, the bacteria may be stored at 4 °C for 4-5 days.\nPick a single colony to transfer into a 50 mL tube with 10 mL of LB liquid medium and ampicillin (100 µg/mL). Shake the bacteria ON at 37 °C at approximately 330 rpm.\nCentrifuge the culture to pellet the bacteria at 5,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C, discard the supernatant and conserve the bacterial pellet. This can be stored at -20 °C.\nPurify the plasmid with a DNA purification kit from bacteria pellet following manufacturer's instructions (Table of Materials). Calculate the DNA concentration by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm and multiplying by the dilution factor, using the following relationship: A260 of 1.0 = 50 µg/mL pure double strand (ds) DNA.\n3. Lentivirus infection\nNOTE: Perform the lentivirus generation procedure in a Class II laminar flow hood.\n24 h before transfection, seed 1-5 × 106 HEK 293 cells into 100 mm of diameter culture dishes in 8 mL of growth medium and incubate them at 37 °C, 5% CO2 overnight.",
    "Mix 14 µg of pKLO.3G vector with specific insert, 10.5 µg of packing plasmid psPAX and 3.5 µg of envelope plasmid pMD2.G (Table of Materials). Dilute 45 µL of plasmid transfection reagent (Table of Materials) in 700 µL of reduced serum media (Table of Materials) and incubate for 5 min at room temperature. Then combine the DNA mixture with the diluted plasmid transfection reagent, mix gently, and incubate for 20 min at room temperature.\nMeanwhile, change for fresh DMEM the medium of the culture dish of HEK 293 cell cultures (70% confluent at the time of transfection). Then add the entire volume of the DNA solution drop by drop. Rock the dish gently.It is not necessary to add/change medium after transfection.\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 48 h- 72 h to allow shRNAs to reach their optimum transduction checked by GFP fluorescence using a fluorescence microscope. Afterwards, collect the medium with lentivirus and store at 4 °C.\nFiltrate viral supernatant with a 0.45 µm nylon membrane. Aliquot the flow-through in 1 mL. Next, centrifuge at 17,000 x g for 4 h. Discard the supernatant and conserve the pellet. Allow invisible pellet to dry, and, once dried, store at - 80 °C.\n\t\nPerform viral titration by flux cytometry. Seed 4 x 105 HEK 293 cells in 24-well plates and incubate at 37 °C for 24 h. Then resuspend the viral particles in 200 µL of DMEM culture medium (Table of Materials) and add 0.05, 0.02, and 0.005 µL to each well.\nIncubate viral infection for 72 h, remove medium and trypsinize (0.05% trypsin, 1 mL) for 3 min. Add 1 mL of DMEM in 10% FCS solution and centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and wash the pellet twice with PBS.",
    "Resuspend the pellet with 100 µL of PBS and fix the cells with 100 µL of 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Analyze the cells with a flux cytometer and determine the percentage of GFP fluorescent cells. Collect this data to calculate viral titration using the following formula:\nViral Titration\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61974/61974eq01.jpg\n4. Primary neuron cultures stressed with ganglioside GM2 accumulation and immunocytochemistry using anti-MAP2 antibody\nInfect the primary cortical neuron cultures (15 days in vitro) with specific shRNA oligonucleotides targeting the 3' UTRs of either CN-Aα or CHOP and incubate them at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 1 day.\n\tNOTE: Primary cortical neuron cultures of 7-8 days in vitro could also be used if the cells show high neurite growth.\n\t\nPrepare a 500 µM stock solution of ganglioside GM2 in ethanol and sonicate it for 1 h.\nAdd GM2 stock solution to the culture dishes medium at a final concentration of 2 µM. Allow to incubate at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 16, 24, and 48 h.\nUse some cultures to prepare cellular homogenate for western blot analysis (for antibody specification, see the Table of Materials).\nFollow steps 1.4. and 1.5. and then fix the cells with 4% PFA and 120 mM sucrose in PBS for 20 min at 37 °C, and then wash it with PBS. Perform this procedure on an anti-slipping membrane in a wet chamber. Afterwards, add permeabilization solution (0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 5 min and wash with PBS.\n\t\nUse 5% BSA diluted in PBS for 45 min to allow blocking, then incubate with anti-MAP2 antibody, diluted 1:800 in blocking solution, at 4 °C overnight.",
    "At the end of the incubation time, wash twice with PBS and incubate with secondary antibody (Table of Materials) for 1 h. Then wash the cells with PBS and mount the glasses onto slides using an aqueous mounting medium (Table of Materials).\n5. Neurite atrophy analysis\nObtain images with a 20x air lens (NA 0.8) using an epifluorescence-inverted microscope equipped with a CCD-camera. Analyze images with ImageJ plug-ins. For this, load the picture to ImageJ and subtract the background by clicking on Process | Subtract Background.\nClick on Image | Adjust | Threshold or type the following keys: Ctrl (or Cmd) + Shift + T. A window pops open to adjust minimum values, allowing path and soma tracings to be distinguishable. Click on the binary image (neurites and somas are white colored). On this image, use freehand selection to delete somas; the selected soma area turns black again.\nSelect traces and click Edit | Selection | Create Selection. Get the ROI by clicking Ctrl (or Cmd) and T keys of the selection and conserve it. Open the original image, then click on the ROI manager panel and select the belonging ROI, previously obtained. Then click on the original image.\nOnce the ROI traces on the image, type Ctrl (or Cmd) and M keys (Analyze | Measure). A window pops open; copy the mean value (arbitrary units a.u.) to process statistical analysis.\n\tNOTE: To obtain values as µm, click on Analyze | Set Scale. A window pops up open to set values. Be sure to add the correct scale (Analyze | Set Scale) depending on the characteristics of the microscope used.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
