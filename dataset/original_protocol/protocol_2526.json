Depending on the binding strength, chemical shift changes or perturbations (CSPs) induced by the ligand fall into three regimes on the NMR time scale: slow exchange (strong interaction), fast exchange (weak interaction), or intermediate exchange (intermediate-strength interaction). Analysis of CSPs and mapping of the binding interfaces work best for the weak interactions, where chemical shifts can be tracked during titration of the ligand.\nOpen the Assign module of CCPN (version 3.

    "Open the recorded HSQC spectra of BRD4 ET (apo state) and BRD4 ET – E peptide complex by dragging and dropping the related processed HSQC “spectrum_name.ft2” files in the “Drop Area” of CCPN program. In this example, the spectra’s names are “apo.ft2” and “complex.ft2” for the apo state and bound state, respectively.\nNote: After dropping the spectra in the “Dropping Area”, spectra names are listed under “Spectrum” menu (on the left side of the program window) as “SP:spectrum_name”.\nNote: If a spectrum is not displayed after dropping, drag the spectrum name (“SP:spectrum_name” under “Spectra” menu on the left side of the program window) and drop it in the “Dropping Area”.\nNote: The spectrum display can be toggled on or off by clicking on the spectrum name in “SpectrumDisplay” module.\nNote: Spectra can be zoomed in or out by scrolling the middle click.\nSpectrum properties including spectrum name, spectrum type, peak color, and first contour level can be adjusted by opening the “Spectrum Properties” (to open this module, double click on “SP:spectrum_name” under “Spectra” menu on the left side of the program window).\nDownload the chemical shift list for BRD4 ET (aa 601–683) from the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank website (https://bmrb.io[href=https://bmrb.io]) in the NMR-STAR v3 file format. Here, the shift list with bmrb code bmr26041 was used.\nImport the shift list into the CCPN program and simulate HSQC peaks:\nClick on “Project” in the menu bar, hover on “Import” until the pop-up menu appears then select “NMRStar File”.\nIn the “Import NMRStar File” pop-up window, navigate to the location where the NMR-STAR v3 file is saved, select the file, then click on “open”.",
    "Check the “Simulate Peaks From Atoms” box to simulate the HSQC peaks and click on “Import”. The imported chemical shift list is added under “ChemicalShiftLists” in the left side menu. The simulated.\nAdd the simulated HSQC peaks to the HSQC spectra:\nOpen the “Peak Table” module by clicking on “View” from the main menu, then click on “Peak Table”.\nIn the “Peak Table” module select “PL:NH.1” from the “PeakList” drop-down menu.\nSelect all peaks by simultaneously pressing ctrl+A (command+A in Mac).\nRight click anywhere on the selected peaks and click on “Copy Peaks…”.\nIn the “Copy peaks to PeakLists” pop-up window, select the desired peak lists from the “Select Destination PeakLists” section. Here, “PL:apo.1” and “PL:complex.1” peak lists were selected by pressing ctrl (command in Mac) and clicking on each desired peak list names.\nAfter selecting the desired peak lists, click “Copy” and then “Close” to close the pop-up window. Now the synthesized peaks can be seen in the related spectrum in “SpectrumDisplay” module.\nNote: Alternatively, peaks can be added to each spectrum by dragging the peak list from the sidebar (default→Spectra→SP:NH→PeakLists→PL:NH.1) and dropping it on the related spectrum in the “SpectrumDisplay” module. For this method, only the desired spectrum should be displayed (toggled on), and other spectra displays should be toggled off (cf. Notes in step 8).\nMove each peak assignment to the relative peak center in each spectrum:\nToggle on one spectrum and toggle off the rest of the spectra.\nSelect one peak assignment by clicking on the peak assignment. Right click on the selected peak assignment and select “Snap Peak(s) to extrema” or use the “S,E” shortcut (press S then press E). If a peak cannot be assigned unequivocally, select the peak and delete it using Delete button (clear or fn+delete in Mac).",
    "Repeat the process for all peaks in all spectra.\nNote: If “S,E” fails to move the peak assignment peak extrema, drag the assignment by right-clicking (or middle-clicking) on the assignment and drop it near the peak center, then press “S,E”.\nNote: Shortcut “R,P” refits the selected peak with a gaussian fit. “R,G” refits a group of selected peaks.\nExport the peak lists:\nOpen the peak table by clicking on “View” in the main menu, then “Peak Table” (or use shortcut “P,T”.\nSelect the peak list of the apo spectrum (PL.apo.1) from the “PeakList” drop-down menu. If PL.apo.1 is empty, select peak list PL.apo.2.\nRight-click on one the column titles and select “Column Settings…”\nCheck or uncheck to add or remove the columns that need be exported. At least “Assign F1” (1H assignment), “Pos F1” (1H chemical shift), and “Pos F2” (15N chemical shift) are needed for calculating chemical shift perturbations. Click on “Close” after selecting the desired columns.\nRight-click anywhere on the peak table and select “Export Visible Table” to merely export the desired columns.\nSelect the desired location, name, and format to export the peak table, then click “Save”. Here, format xlsx was selected.\nNote: Reassure the name is accompanied by an extension such as .xlsx, otherwise table export may not be done properly.\nSelect the peak list of the complex (PL:complex.1) and repeat steps 14.c through 14.f.\nCalculate the chemical shift perturbations:\nOpen the exported peak lists by a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Office Excel.\nCopy columns containing 1H and 15N chemical shifts from complex peak list file and paste them in the apo peak list file, so that each assignment in each row contains the relative 1H and 15N chemical shifts for both apo state and the complex.",
    "Use the following equation to calculate chemical shift perturbations (CSP):   Δ δ =     (  Δ δ H  )  2  +   (  Δ δ N / 5  )  2     , where Δδ is the change in chemical shift in parts per million (ppm).\nCalculate the average and standard deviation of the chemical shift perturbations.\nPlot chemical shift perturbations against residue number as a bar plot.\nRepresent the sum of average and standard deviation line on the bar graph.\nResidues with chemical shift perturbations of greater than the sum of average and standard deviation are the most significantly perturbed residues.\nNote: Depending on the data, multiples or fractions of standard deviation can be used to determine the most perturbed residues.\nMeasurement of viral replication kinetics using qRT-PCR\nTiming: 1 day\nThis step allows the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA present in the culture supernatant collected during the termination of the reaction. The SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the culture supernatant is determined using qRT-PCR. In this method, the culture supernatant is heat-inactivated and directly added to the qRT-PCR reaction mix to quantify viral load.\nThe composition of the reaction mix:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2159_18.csv\nThe thermal cycling parameter of the reaction:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2159_19.csv\nHeat inactivation of culture supernatant:\nCentrifuge the tubes having culture supernatant for a brief spin to ensure all contents are at bottom of the tube.\nPre-heat a heat block to 65°C.\nOnce temperature is reached, incubate the samples for 30 min at 65°C.\nThe qRT-PCR is performed using a set of primers/probes targeting the E gene of SARS-CoV-2 (P087, P088 and P089).
