    "Maintenance of hESCs is essential to keep cells undifferentiated and provide a consistent source of cells for reproducible experiments. hESCs are cultured on a Matrigel substrate in defined medium with daily medium changes to prevent cell toxicity and maintain constant levels of nutrients and growth factors. Sterile technique is essential, as cells are typically cultured in media free of antibiotics and antifungals to improve cell growth and minimize spontaneous differentiation. Cultures should be checked at each medium change to monitor the health of the cells and the growth of cell aggregates. Quality-control testing for tissue culture of primary and/or sensitive cells, including regular mycoplasma, microbiological, and endotoxin testing and reagent validation, and regular training updates, among other measures, should be included if not already part of standard practice. Healthy cells have a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio; are adherent, with smooth edges; and exhibit rapidly increased growth after several days in culture. hESCs in this protocol are maintained as aggregates (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-fig-0001]) to promote expansion and suppress spontaneous differentiation. Although hESCs can be grown either as aggregates or as single cells (easier for cell counting and essential for generating clonal cell lines), aggregate growth supports a consistent cell phenotype, prevents the development of abnormal clones, and is required for long-term maintenance and robust initiation of hematopoietic differentiation (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-prot-0002]).\nMaterials\nmTeSR1 supplement and basal medium (STEMCELL Technologies, cat. no. 85852)\nMatrigel, hESC qualified (Corning, cat. no. 35427; aliquot according to manufacturer's instructions; store at −20°C)\nDMEM/F12 medium (Gibco, cat. no. 11320-033), 4°C\nhESCs [e.g., cells used in our study: WA01 (H1) NIH registry #0043 (WiCell, cat. no.

Thaw a Matrigel aliquot on ice.\nChoose an aliquot size appropriate for the number of wells needed.\nWhen preparing to either thaw cells or split cells, coat plates with Matrigel. In this protocol, all hESC culture steps (passage, testing, differentiation) are performed in 6-well plates with 1 ml Matrigel coating solution per well.\n5. Aliquot 1 ml cold DMEM/F12 medium per well into a 15- or 50-ml conical tube and place on ice.\n6. Add 500 μl cold DMEM/F12 to the thawed Matrigel aliquot (of any size) and quickly but thoroughly mix by pipetting. Then, transfer to the conical tube containing the remaining DMEM/F12.\n7.

Before starting cell culture, warm complete mTeSR1 medium from step 3 to room temperature.\nDo not use a water bath to warm the medium.\nIf feeding only 1 to 2 wells of cells, aliquot the complete medium into smaller volumes (∼10 ml) to avoid repeated warming of larger medium volumes.\n12. Identify the batch of hESCs to be used and determine the optimal number of wells needed per vial of frozen cells.\nThe optimal number of wells for each vial of frozen cells is based on aggregate number and is either provided in the information included with commercially obtained cells or determined experimentally after banking cell batches (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-prot-0004]).\n13.

Resuspend cells gently in complete mTeSR1 medium (1 ml per well of a 6-well plate) using a 5-ml serological pipet.\nPipet gently and carefully and use a 5-ml serological pipet (which has a wider bore than a micropipet tip) to avoid breaking up aggregates.\n20. Gently add cells to the prepared Matrigel-coated plates (see step 14) by adding 1 ml cell aggregate/medium suspension to each well.\n21. Place plates in the incubator and distribute aggregates evenly across the surface and incubate for 24 hr.\nTo distribute, leave the plate sitting flat on the incubator shelf and move the plate quickly using back-and-forth and side-to-side motions to minimize settling of cells in the center of the wells.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Be sure not to disturb the cells for the next 24 hr. Minimize vibrations from nearby equipment and the force of opening/closing the incubator door.\nThe following section assumes that day 1 is the day immediately following the day the cells were split or thawed.\nMaintenance of hESC cultures\nDay 1\n22. Warm complete mTeSR1 medium from step 3 to room temperature (2 ml per well of cells).\n23. Remove cells from the incubator (see step 21).\nDo not remove more than two plates at a time to minimize exposure of the cells to ambient temperatures, as hESCs spontaneously differentiate if the temperature fluctuates.",
    "24. Check cells on one plate for aggregate adherence, aggregate number, and aggregate dispersal using a tissue culture microscope.\nAggregate assessment varies depending on the day post-thaw/post-split and the intended use. See Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-tbl-0001] for specifics and Figure 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-fig-0001] for example plating density. The ideal number of aggregates depends on application (hESC maintenance vs. differentiation of hESCs to HPCs; see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-prot-0002] and Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-fig-0003]). Maintenance of hESCs is more flexible than differentiation, and an initial aggregate density of about 100 to 500 aggregates per well is usable following the guidelines in steps 33 to 35.\nTable 1.\n                Aggregate Analysis (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-prot-0001])\ntable:\n﻿Unnamed: 0,Description,Day 1,Day 2,Day 3 and onward\nAggregates present,Small aggregates (left two aggregates in Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-fig-0001]),Continue with step 22 to feed the cells,\"Check that aggregates are still present and have maintained their size or enlarged slightly (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-fig-0001], right aggregate) and then continue with step 29 to feed the cells\",Confirm that aggregates are appropriately attached to the plate and have normal morphology and edges (Fig. 1C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-fig-0001])\nNo aggregates visible,Cells appear as single cells or very small clusters of cells (4-10 cells) attached to the plate,\"If the medium is clear and no “sheets” of cells are visible, continue with step 22 and check the wells again at day 2 (aggregates could be too small to see)\",\"Check to see if aggregates are now visible (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-fig-0001]).

    "Aggregate plating variations (between batches and users) and impact on HPC yield. (A) A trial experiment using matched-passage WA01 aggregates (passaged by one user) that were then split and plated as if for differentiation by five different users. Three users (1, 2, 3) repeated this experiment with 1 to 2 additional batches of WA01 cells at different passages (replicates b and c). Aggregate counts are shown for the intended plating density (plated, black bars) and the number of aggregates present on the following day (day 0, gray bars). (B) Cumulative data from one user (after initial trial batches to gain experience) with multiple differentiation experiments using WA01 cells showing the relationship between plating density (aggregates per well at day 0) and the total number of HPCs recovered at 12 days post-differentiation (per well).

Aspirate medium from the plate, being careful not to disturb the cell aggregates or scratch the plate.\n26.

    "For determination of passaging time, see Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-tbl-0001]. For troubleshooting aggregate health, see Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-tbl-0002].\nTable 2.\n                Troubleshooting Guide for Aggregate Growth\ntable:\n﻿Problem,Possible cause,Solution\nAggregate loss or cell death,Aggregate size is suboptimal (too small or too large),\"Re-plate cells using gentler technique (to reduce cell death) or check attachment conditions (to reduce cell loss; e.g., check Matrigel batch, cell density)\"\nPoor recovery of aggregates post-thaw,Aggregate number per vial is suboptimal (too few or too many),Re-check optimal thaw ratio\nPoor recovery of aggregates post-thaw,Aggregates lost at handling,\"Re-plate cells using gentler technique (to reduce cell death) or check attachment conditions (to reduce cell loss, e.g., check Matrigel batch, cell density)\"\nToo many aggregates post-thaw or split,Too many aggregates plated,Plate fewer aggregates at next split (and monitor for faster expansion and increased risk of spontaneous differentiation)\nSparse aggregates post-thaw or split,Too few aggregates plated,Increase density at initial plating.

This will sacrifice some healthy aggregates (also remaining attached to the plate) but removes areas of differentiation from the passage.\n30. Check cells for aggregate condition (adherence, number, and dispersal) and for signs of spontaneous differentiation.",
    "See Figures 1C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-fig-0001] and 1D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-fig-0001] for example images of large normal aggregates and spontaneous differentiation. Spontaneous differentiation is normal in hESC cultures at a rate of <2% of total aggregates and can be used as a quick surrogate for pluripotency. However, excess spontaneous differentiation (>5% of total aggregates or occurring every passage), visualized by the appearance of endothelial-like cells or spiky protrusions from the edges of aggregates (Fig. 1D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-fig-0001], yellow circle), indicates an unhealthy culture.\n31. Estimate aggregate number and size.\nThe overall aggregate number will influence the passage date (more aggregates will require an earlier passage even though the aggregate size will be smaller, as a more crowded well will have aggregates that begin to merge earlier), and this will influence the passage timing and ratio. Aggregate size will also influence passage timing (a plate with few but very large aggregates will also require an earlier passage, as cells in the center of a large aggregate have less nutrient accessibility and reduced physical space for growth, resulting in senescence and cell death).\n32. Estimate upcoming passage date based on aggregate density.\nCells should be passaged when aggregates are densely packed but not completely merged. Merged aggregates essentially function as extra-large aggregates, with the same reduction in cell health (see step 31). Note that aggregates grow quicker at later dates from passaging and can rapidly expand from one day to the next near the end.\n33. Feed or passage cells as appropriate.\nTo feed, follow steps 22 to 28. To passage (or split), see steps 34 to 46.\nPassaging hESCs\n34. Determine split ratio of the cells by estimating (or counting; see Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-prot-0005]) the number of aggregates and the size of the aggregates present.",
    "The split ratio is determined both by the number of aggregates you obtain after splitting the cells (estimated based on aggregate size and density, the specifics of the handling technique, and the amount of spontaneous differentiation present and verified with the actual aggregate count post-split) and by the intended downstream use for the cells (see below). Specifics within the suggested range should be empirically determined.\nFor expansion or banking of cells, use a 1:10 to 1:50 split ratio. For expanding cells for hematopoietic differentiation, use a 1:10 to 1:20 ratio. For freezing cells, use a 1:5 to 1:10 ratio.\n35. Prepare new Matrigel-coated plates for passaging as above (see steps 4 to 10) or prepare for freezing cells (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-prot-0004], steps 1 to 11).\n36. Warm complete mTeSR1 medium from step 3 to room temperature (1 ml per well to harvest plus enough medium for plating or freezing).\n37. Remove one plate from the incubator and aspirate medium from the wells.\nWork with just one plate at a time, as it is critical to not let the plates dry out.\n38. Wash wells with 1 ml DPBS and aspirate wash.\nGently add PBS down the side of the wells without disturbing the aggregates.\n39. Add 1 ml ReLeSR per well and aspirate all ReLeSR within 1 min.\nThis leaves a thin (invisible) film of liquid over the cells.\nReLeSR is an enzymatic solution used to detach aggregates or cells from Matrigel-coated plates. ReLeSR is stored and used at room temperature.",
    "A good time for ReLeSR incubation is the time it takes to add 1 ml liquid to five additional wells (i.e., if you are processing a whole 6-well plate, add ReLeSR to each well and then remove the ReLeSR from the wells in order, without rushing; if you are processing fewer than six wells, mentally mimic processing the other wells to space out the timing.\n40. Incubate the plate after ReLeSR removal at 37°C for 5 to 7 min.\nThe incubation time varies depending on (1) the individual user (even after training), (2) the incubator (even with frequent calibration), and (3) the aggregate size and density (larger and denser aggregates will take longer to remove). A good practice is to place the plate in the incubator for 4.5 min and then remove it and check under the microscope for loosening of aggregates (aggregate edges should be compacted, and cells should be retracted into the body of the aggregate). Incubate longer as needed, with continual monitoring under the microscope at room temperature. Reference images of aggregates at different times during ReLeSR incubation can be found in the ReLeSR manual from STEMCELL Technologies.\n41. Add 1 ml complete mTeSR1 medium per well to stop ReLeSR action.\n42. Detach colonies by gentle but firm tapping on the sides of the plate.\nHold the plate firmly in one hand and tap the side of the plate using the other hand. Then, rotate the plate and repeat the tapping on each of the remaining sides, distributing the force equally across the plate. Empirically determine the number of times to tap the plate. A good starting point is 8 to 13 times per side, resulting in release of ∼95% of all aggregates without reducing individual aggregate size more than 50%.",
    "43. If working with multiple wells, use a 5-ml serological pipet to transfer all cell aggregates to a 15- or 50-ml conical tube. Pipet up and down once when all cells are transferred to the conical to get even distribution of aggregates in solution and help homogenize aggregate size.\nOptional: Check that the cell aggregates are appropriately sized by counting the aggregates and/or individual cells as described in Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-prot-0005]. If aggregates are too big, pipet gently to break up.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: It is very important that aggregates are at the appropriate size (50 to 200 μm; Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-fig-0001]) and of the appropriate number for passaging. For troubleshooting aggregate size, see Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-tbl-0002].\n44. Repeat steps 37 to 43 for all remaining plates to be harvested.\n45. Plate cells at the desired density on the prepared plates from step 35 or freeze cells as in Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-prot-0004], steps 1 to 11.\nThe desired density should be such that cultures can be split every 4 to 7 days and is usually a 1:10 to 1:50 split. If the cells were too dense or too sparse at the last split, adjust the split ratio accordingly.\n46. Place plate back in the incubator, evenly distribute cells (see step 21), and leave undisturbed for 24 hr.",
    "Differentiation of hESCs (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-prot-0001]) to HPCs can be performed with a variety of methods (Akopian et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-bib-0001]; Choi et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-bib-0004]; Crawford et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-bib-0005]; Kim et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-bib-0009]; Salvagiotto et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-bib-0020]). Here, we use defined commercial media and two distinct cytokine stimulation steps. First, hESCs are passaged, and early-stage (1-day post-passage) aggregates are induced to undergo a hematopoietic-endothelial transition beginning with differentiation to an endothelial-like adherent layer (days 1 to 3), followed by commitment to hematopoiesis (days 3 to 5) and finally further expansion of the hematopoietic population (days 6 to 12). After hematopoietic commitment and expansion, HPCs are harvested off the endothelial cell layer, collected, and washed, and then they can be used for downstream assays. This protocol is optimized to use one complete bottle of the STEMdiff Hematopoietic Kit to differentiate 15 wells of hESCs and yields ∼2 × 107 CD34+ HPCs. However, the entire protocol can easily be scaled down proportionally. An outline of the differentiation is shown in the last panel of Figure 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-fig-0001].\nNOTE: At all steps, be careful not to disturb the aggregates by scratching with the pipet tip or by pipetting liquid onto the aggregate surfaces directly, and watch out for drying of exposed well surfaces during handling steps.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-prot-0001])\nSTEMdiff Hematopoietic Kit, containing STEMdiff basal medium and Supplements A and B (STEMCELL Technologies, cat. no. 05310; store all at −20°C)\nIMDM (Iscove's Modification of DMEM; HyClone, cat. no.

Therefore, it is possible to plan differentiation experiments within a ∼2-day range but not exactly before the point of hESC split for differentiation.\nDay –1: preparing and splitting cells\n4. Prepare 15 wells in three separate 6-well tissue culture plates by coating with 1 ml prepared Matrigel solution (as in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-prot-0001], steps 4 to 10 and steps 13 and 14).\nPre-grid the bottom of two wells for easier counting on day 0 by drawing lines ∼4 mm apart with an ultra-fine-point permanent pen. Each grid square should be visible on all sides under a 4× objective under a microscope, and the squares are simply guides to keep track of your location in the well when counting. Grid these two wells on two separate plates for replicate counts so cells are exposed to outside-incubator conditions for minimal possible time to minimize spontaneous differentiation and cell death due to handling. An example grid is shown in Figure 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-fig-0002], image 1.",

For the author, 350 aggregates reliably result in 200 aggregates per well on the following day (day 0; see also Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-fig-0003]).\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Aggregates must number between 100 and 300 per well on the next day to get optimal differentiation. Aggregate counting can vary between users, as does the total number of aggregates that remain at day 0 (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-fig-0003]), and each individual user should empirically determine the best plating density using repeated small-scale differentiation batches (see also Troubleshooting in the Commentary).\n6. Distribute aggregates evenly across the plate (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-prot-0001], step 21) and culture overnight.\n7. Remove STEMdiff basal medium (from the STEMdiff Hematopoietic Kit) from the freezer and thaw at 4°C overnight.\nDay 0: initial differentiation of aggregates\n8. Count aggregates from each gridded well independently, storing all other plates in the incubator throughout counting.\n9. Confirm that about 200 aggregates are present per well.\nThe number of aggregates present here at day 0 is generally reduced compared to the number plated at day –1 (see step 5 above), and each user should individually determine the survival rate to optimize to about 200 surviving aggregates per well at this step. It does not matter how many aggregates each user needs to plate at day 0 as long as the survival number is predictable (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-fig-0003]).",
    "IMPORTANT NOTE: If aggregates are widely different between wells, if aggregate counts are not appropriate (more or less than desired; Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-fig-0003]), or if aggregates are of poor quality (Fig. 1C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-fig-0001]), stop here and set up a new batch of cells.\n10. Prepare Medium A:\n         \nRetrieve STEMdiff basal medium from being thawed at 4°C overnight. If the medium is not completely thawed, place it temporarily at room temperature until all ice is gone. When the medium is thawed (do not let it warm up yet), proceed with steps 10b to 10g.\nRemove Supplement A (from the STEMdiff Hematopoietic Kit) from −20°C ∼5 min before use.\nAliquot 45.5 ml STEMdiff basal medium to a 50-ml conical tube.\nVortex Supplement A and quick-spin.\nAdd 225 μl Supplement A (all of it) to the STEMdiff basal medium aliquot to make Medium A.\nReturn remaining STEMdiff basal medium to 4°C immediately.\nAllow Medium A aliquot to come to room temperature before proceeding.\nThis protocol is for one batch (15 wells). If you are processing smaller batches, follow the manufacturer's instructions to aliquot supplements and media.\n11. Remove all plates from the incubator.\nThis step involves a quick medium change only, so it is more practical to remove all the plates in one step to minimize opening/closing the incubator (and disturbing other cells), and the medium change is quick enough that this causes no harm to the current cells at this step.\n12. Aspirate medium from one plate.\n13. Immediately add 2 ml Medium A to each well.\n14. Repeat steps 12 and 13 for remaining plates.\n15. Return all plates to incubator and leave undisturbed.\n16. Store remaining Medium A at 4°C until day 2.\nDay 2: differentiation of aggregates, part 1\n17. Warm Medium A to room temperature.",
    "18. Remove plates from the incubator and check that aggregates are present and enlarged compared to day 0.\nIf the user is comfortable with aggregate analysis, all three plates can be handled in one batch, as the medium change is quick. If desired or if still learning analysis, each plate can be handled individually.\n19. Remove 1 ml medium (half the well volume) from each well of one plate and discard.\n20. Immediately add 1 ml fresh Medium A to each well.\n21. Repeat steps 19 and 20 for all plates.\n22.

    "30. Warm Medium B to room temperature.\n31. Remove plates from the incubator and check that aggregates are differentiating.\n32. Remove 1 ml medium (half the well volume) from each well of one plate and discard.\nAt days 7 and 10, remove only 0.9 ml medium from each well to account for evaporation, so that the final well volume is 1 ml old medium plus 1 ml new medium after the medium change.\nA representative image of successful differentiation is shown in Figure 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-fig-0002].\n33. Immediately add 1 ml fresh Medium B to each well.\n34. Repeat steps 32 and 33 for all plates.\n35. Return all plates to incubator and leave undisturbed.\n36. Store remaining Medium B at 4°C until needed.\nDay 12: harvest of HPCs\n37. Warm DMEM/F12 medium to 37°C.\n38. Set up 50-ml conical tubes to collect all harvested cells.\nCells are collected by supernatant removal and multiple wash steps (with a minimum of two 50-ml conical tubes per batch). The number of wash steps varies at step 43 depending on the degree of HPC attachment and user variability, so additional 50-ml conical tubes for collection are likely to be needed. Have extra tubes available and use as many as needed to collect all HPCs. The number of tubes used in steps 40 to 43 does not matter, as all cells will be combined at step 46.\n39. Remove one plate from the incubator.\n40. Harvest supernatant cells:\n         \nUsing a 1-ml pipet tip, gently pipet supernatant around the first well a couple of times and transfer all medium plus floating cells to a 50-ml conical tube.\nAdd 2 ml warm DMEM/F12 to well.\nRepeat steps 40a and 40b for all remaining wells on the plate.\nCheck that floaters and loosely attached cells are removed before proceeding.",
    "Some HPCs naturally release into the supernatant or are very loosely attached to the aggregate. These are visible as suspension cells at this step (Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-fig-0002], image 2), and gentle, minimal pipetting force at this step removes these cells while protecting their viability before proceeding to dispersal of more firmly attached HPCs (see steps 41 to 43).\nHPCs are attached to the surface of the aggregate to different degrees (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-fig-0002]) and must all be removed. This is achieved by balancing trituration of attached cells with frequent removal of detached cells to preserve viability in steps 41 and 42.\n41.

    "In steps 52a to 52e, the volume and type of medium used for resuspension depend on the number of wells harvested, the cell pellet size, and downstream applications. Some suggestions for a full batch of cells are described here.\n53. Count using trypan blue to distinguish live versus dead cells.\nFull differentiation will yield a mixture of HPCs (majority population) that should be ≥80% live plus a minor fraction of dead cells (<5%), endothelial cells (lifted from the adherent layer during harvest), and erythroid differentiating cells (that due to heme production can easily be miscounted as trypan blue positive). Differentiation success (and viability) can be measured by flow cytometry–based phenotyping using Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-prot-0006].

    "The main hallmarks of HPCs are long-term survival without differentiation (survival and self-renewal) and the ability to undergo directed, purposeful differentiation to their own specific downstream lineages (differentiation). This protocol outlines two different methods to test and validate HPC function following hESC-to-HPC differentiation (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-prot-0002]). The cells discussed here are HPCs and no longer hESCs. Here, we first use stromal cells to maintain and expand HPCs in vitro (Walenda et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-bib-0026]). Culturing HPCs on a feeder layer of bone marrow stromal cells for an additional 12 days allows measurement of long-term stem cell survival. Second, we use a classic method to assess the differentiation potential of HPCs to the myeloid lineage using a myeloid colony-forming assay (Bock, 1997[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-bib-0003]), which is used extensively to assess stem cell function and predict transplant success. In this assay, single HPCs are plated in semi-solid medium supplemented with cytokines and expand to clonal colonies differentiating to myeloid and erythroid lineages. Colonies are counted at 7 days (total initial survival), 14 days (total colonies and early differentiation), and 21 days (complete differentiation for hESC-derived HPCs).\nMaterials\nStromal cells [e.g., M2-10B and S1/S1 stromal cells obtained from STEMCELL Technologies on behalf of Dr. Donna Hogge at Terry Fox Laboratories, BC Cancer Agency; STEMCELL Technologies, 00301 and 00302 special request, not catalog listed; maintained and passaged according to Umashankar & Goodrum (2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-bib-0023])]\n1 mg/ml collagen solution (see recipe)\nDPBS, without calcium and magnesium (Corning, cat. no. 21-031-CV)\nStromal cell medium\nHPCs differentiated from hESCs (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-prot-0002])\nComplete MyeloCult (MyeloCult H5100, STEMCELL Technologies, cat. no. 05150) containing 1 μM hydrocortisone (STEMCELL Technologies, cat. no. 74142; pre-filtered with a 0.22-μm syringe filter)\nMethoCult SF H4436 (STEMCELL Technologies, cat. no. 04436)\nIMDM (Iscove's Modification of DMEM; HyClone, cat. no.

This is a reduction in colony-forming ability compared to that in cells from bone marrow (about 1:20 to 1:500 cells), cord blood (about 1:20 cells), and fetal liver (about 1:5 cells).\nAdd N+1 ml MethoCult to a 5- or 15-ml tube (depending on replicate number and availability; e.g., for three replicates, 4 ml MethoCult is needed).\nAdd cells to the medium.\nMix well by vortexing and allow bubbles to settle.\nPlate 1.1 ml MethoCult + cells in each well of a 6-well flat-bottom plate.\nSmartDishes (specific 6-well flat-bottom plates) are required if using the STEMvision Analysis System. If counting manually, 6-well tissue culture dishes or individual 35-mm dishes can be used.\nPlating option 2 requires more cells and Methocult (to make a master mix) but less practice for even dispersal of single cells throughout the medium.\n21. Check each well for bubbles and complete coverage with medium.\n22. Place plates in a secondary container with open 35-mm dishes containing sterile water to maintain humidity and prevent drying of MethoCult.\n23. Incubate at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nColony counting\n24. Count colonies at 7, 14, and 21 days post-plating using the STEMvision System or a tissue culture microscope.",
    "A valuable reference for colony types and counting can be found in the manuals from the main vendors (including STEMCELL Technologies), but note that colonies from hESCs are usually less abundant, more diffuse, and not quite typical in morphology compared to colonies from cord blood and bone marrow (and therefore do differ somewhat from the manuals’ images). Individual colony types from hESC-derived HPCs can be seen in Figure 4A from our original publication (Crawford et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-bib-0005]). For cells that fail to differentiate into myeloid cells, confirm proliferation ability using long-term culture (above) and/or see Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-tbl-0003] for troubleshooting.",
    "Banked hESCs are essential for maintaining low-passage cells (required for appropriate differentiation) and a consistent lab stock of uniform cells. Cells currently (as of 2022) available from WiCell are shipped at passage 22 (WA01) or passage 26 (WA09). Although hESCs can be maintained in culture through more than 70 passages, pluripotency markers and gene expression stability change over time (Rosler et al., 2004[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-bib-0019]). This is especially relevant for downstream differentiation to hematopoietic lineages, as Choi et al. (2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-bib-0004]) recommend using cells no later than passage 50, and we have successfully used these hESCs for viral infection studies through passage 42 with no loss of function. This protocol outlines a robust serum-based freezing method to store cells where hESC aggregates are harvested from ideal growth conditions and cryogenically stored. Regardless of method, however, each batch of frozen hESCs varies slightly in recovery. The second part of this protocol outlines a process to empirically test frozen cell batches for viability, aggregate recovery, and aggregate condition using a plating dilution scheme and daily assessment.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-prot-0001])\nComplete mTeSR1 medium (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-prot-0001], step 3)\nFreezing medium (see recipe)\nLiquid nitrogen (in cryogenic storage system of choice)\nCryovials (1.8 or 2.0 ml, rated for liquid-phase storage appropriate for cryogenic storage system)\nControlled-rate freezing container (Corning, cat. no. 432138, or equivalent)\nFreezing hESCs\n1. Determine number of cryovials needed for freezing and pre-label.\nPost-thaw recovery varies due to a number of factors, so each batch should be pre-tested for optimal plating density (see steps 12 to 33):\n1) Controllable factors: freezing medium used, handling and processing time and conditions, time stored at −80°C, long-term storage conditions (liquid nitrogen storage).",
    "2) Partially controllable factors (may vary between users): aggregate density, aggregate size, minor culture condition variations (e.g., temperature fluctuations or vibrations from others using the same culture incubator).\n3) Partially controllable factors due to specific cell line, batch, and culture conditions: time in culture since last passage, passage number.\n4) Uncontrollable factors: cell density within aggregates, overall cellular survival in culture.\nNote that these factors are not necessarily problematic but should be considered when testing batches for reproducibility.\n2. Warm complete mTeSR1 medium (0.5 ml per final vial plus 1 ml per well to harvest) to room temperature.\n3. Passage hESCs as described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-prot-0001], steps 34 to 44, and collect all cells for this batch into one conical tube.\nUse optimal and actively growing aggregates for freezing. Optimal aggregates are medium to large in size (500 to 1000 μm); are 70% to 80% confluent in the well, but with minimal aggregates touching each other; have even morphology, with minimal spontaneous differentiation and dense centers in the aggregate; and are at about 4 to 5 days after the previous split or 1 day before you would normally passage cells for maintenance growth.\nA good starting point is to freeze one well of a 6-well plate of large aggregates that are 70% to 80% confluent in one freezing vial. This is very approximately 750 to 1000 aggregates per vial, although we routinely split by confluence equivalence rather than counted aggregates, as the time and additional handling required to count aggregates reduce frozen aggregate survival. More details of the thawing ratio and adjustments are provided in the testing section of this protocol (below).\n4. Spin down for 5 min at 300 × g at room temperature.\n5. Gently remove supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet.",
    "Decant the supernatant and, keeping the tube upside down, blot on a Kimwipe/paper towel to drain remaining wash solution.\n6. Gently resuspend cells in 0.5 ml complete mTeSR1 medium per final vial of frozen cells, taking care to avoid breaking up aggregates.\n7. Slowly add an equivalent volume (0.5 ml per final vial) of freezing medium.\nFreezing medium is used at a 1:1 ratio with normal growth medium (for hESCs, use complete mTeSR1) for final concentrations of 50% growth medium, 40% (v/v) serum, and 10% (v/v) dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO).\n8. Invert tube gently to mix.\n9. Aliquot 1 ml per cryovial.\n10. Freeze in a controlled-rate freezing container at −80°C for 24 hr.\n11.

For each vial of cells to be tested, coat four wells of a 6-well tissue culture plate with Matrigel as described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-prot-0001], steps 4 to 10.\n13. Warm 9 ml complete mTeSR1 medium to room temperature.\n14. Remove Matrigel solution from the plates and add 1 ml complete mTeSR1 medium to each of the four wells coated with Matrigel.\n15. Label the wells as 1:2, 1:5, 1:10, and 1:100.\n16. Add additional complete mTeSR1 medium to each well so that final volume will be 2 ml at the end of the protocol:\n         \nFor 1:2 well, add 500 μl medium.\nFor 1:5 well, add 800 μl medium.\nFor 1:10 well, add 900 μl medium.\nFor 1:100 well, add 990 μl medium.",
    "17. Thaw one vial of cells to be tested (see step 11) and wash with DMEM/F12 as described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-prot-0001], steps 15 to 18.\n18. Resuspend in 1 ml complete mTeSR1 medium, mixing gently by pipetting.\n19. Plate cells in the four pre-coated wells at different dilutions, starting with the lowest cell number (to avoid aggregate degradation from excessive mixing and to minimize inaccuracies due to settling of cells):\n         \nFor 1:100 well, add 10 μl cells.\nFor 1:10 well, add 100 μl cells.\nFor 1:5 well, add 200 μl cells.\nFor 1:2 well, add 500 μl cells.\n20. Place the plate back in the incubator, distribute aggregates evenly (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-prot-0001], step 21), and leave undisturbed for 24 hr.\n21. Check cells the following day for attachment.\n22. Change medium in all wells as described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-prot-0001], steps 22 to 28, and culture for an additional 24 hr.\n23. Check cells the following day (day 2).\n24. Determine well with the optimal aggregate conditions by assessing aggregate condition, aggregate size, and aggregate density as described in the Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-prot-0001] and Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-tbl-0001].\nA representative image of good aggregate density, size, and condition is shown in Figure 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-fig-0001].\n25. Double-check all wells the following day (day 3) and confirm optimal thaw ratio as in step 24 for this batch.\n26. Change medium in all wells that contain reasonable numbers of aggregates.\nNot all wells will be continued at this point. It is reasonable that, for example, the 1:2 dilution may well be too dense at this point (i.e., 50+% confluence) and/or that the 1:100 well may have no visible aggregates.\n27. Culture cells for an additional 1 to 2 days and make a final determination of optimal thaw ratio depending on the aggregate density.",
    "If the 1:100 well is optimal, then this batch should be thawed into 100 wells. If the 1:10 well is optimal, then this batch should be thawed into 10 wells. If the 1:5 well is optimal, then this batch should be thawed into 5 wells. If the 1:2 well is optimal, then this batch should be thawed into two wells. It is rare that the optimal density is outside of this range, but for specifics, see steps 29 to 33.\n28. Optional: Continue culture (day 3 and onward) for optimal wells only, if desired, for additional expansion for banking or for an experiment. Change the medium on optimal well(s) daily as per normal culture protocols.\n29. If the optimal density is close to ideal, but not ideal, then thaw future batches to the closest estimate.\nFor example, if the 1:5 well is only slightly under the optimal density, thaw this batch at a 1:3 to 1:4 ratio.\n30. If the optimal density is between the larger values (e.g., somewhere between 1:10 and 1:100, where 1:10 is too crowded but 1:100 is too low), then re-test within this range.\nPerform this step if the aggregate density does not match any of those mentioned in step 27.\n31. If no aggregates are present in any well:\n         \nIncubate for an additional day and check again.\nIf no aggregates are present after 3 days, continue only 1:2 well for an additional 2 days to confirm.\nIf no aggregates are present, re-test batch at a 1:1 thaw (i.e., one vial to one well).",
    "If no aggregates are present in a 1:1 thaw, this batch is not viable. Although it may be possible to recover this batch using a single-cell thaw protocol, this changes the cell properties, including phenotype and hematopoietic function. Thus, this batch should be discarded and a different batch used if at all possible.\n32. If all wells are too dense, then estimate optimal thaw ratio as greater than 1:100 and update on next thaw or re-test using a 1:50, 1:100, 1:200, and 1:400 ratio.\nThe 1:50 is added and the 1:100 is repeated because it is very rare to have a 1:100 well that is too dense and because it is possible that either there was an error in diluting the cells to the plate or the vial used for the initial test thaw had an unusual clump of cells, giving it a higher aggregate number than the average vial in the batch. This method increases the chance of success on the second test.\n33. As needed, if the ideal thawing ratio is routinely outside of one vial plated to between 2 to 20 wells, then adjust the freezing ratio for vials that are intended for experimental use, as relatively few wells are needed for scaling up cells for hematopoietic differentiation:\n         \nIf recovery is routinely robust (e.g., one vial thaws into more than 20 wells), then increase freezing ratio to up to 2 to 3 vials per well to have a larger bank of lower-passage cells available.\nIf recovery of these cells is routinely low (e.g., if one vial consistently provides only one well of sparse aggregates, and handling and other conditions are correct), then scale up to freezing two wells per vial.",
    "The optimal number of aggregates in a single well varies depending on the technique used and individual variations in maintenance, expansion, banking, and differentiation. Counting the number of aggregates is a method to more precisely control this variability and also provides an opportunity to more accurately estimate aggregate size, the number of cells per well, and aggregate condition. For example, aggregates at ≥50 μm in diameter are most likely to adhere and grow after splitting (or after freezing or during differentiation). However, aggregates at >100 μm at initial plating are more likely to have increased spontaneous differentiation during routine passage, may be less likely to thaw properly, and may have reduced differentiation capabilities. Aggregate count accuracy varies between individuals, in some instances dramatically; however, person-to-person variation is less of an issue if the following is true: intra-person variation is low (your own counts are consistent) and you have optimized the protocols (splitting and differentiation) for what works with your counts (or you have calibrated your counts to the standard). Here, we describe counting hESCs both by aggregate count, through simple harvest of aggregates (as performed for passaging cells) and manual counting in a gridded dish using a standard microscope, and via single-cell counting using enzymatic dissociation of aggregates and standard counting using a hemocytometer.\nMaterials\nDMEM/F12 medium (Gibco, cat. no. 11320-033)\nhESC aggregates released using ReLeSR (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-prot-0001], step 42)\n0.5% trypsin/EDTA (Gibco, cat. no. 11320-033; store at 4°C)\nDPBS, without calcium and magnesium (Corning, cat. no. 21-031-CV; store at room temperature)\nTrypan blue\n96-well flat-bottom plate\nUltra-fine-point pen\nTissue culture microscope (inverted microscope with 4×, 10×, and 20× objectives; Nikon Ti2 or equivalent)\n1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes\nMicrocentrifuge\nStandard hemocytometer\nAdditional reagents and equipment for plating cells (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.622#cpz1622-prot-0001], steps 34 to 46)\nCounting hESC aggregates",
