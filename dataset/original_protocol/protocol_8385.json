    "1. Isolation of Mitochondria\nNOTE: All solutions and equipment should be precooled to 0 - 4 °C and kept on ice.\nSeed about 3 x 106 SH-SY5Y cells per 10 cm cell culture dish. Culture cells in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 U/mL)-streptomycin (100 µg/mL). Maintain at 37 °C in an incubator containing 5% CO2 overnight.\n\tNOTE: At least 1 - 2 x 107 SH-SY5Y cells are needed for each isolation assay.\nRemove the medium and wash the cells with about 1 mL of ice cold PBS in a 10 cm cell culture dish 3 times.\nAdd new 1 mL of ice cold PBS into 10 cm cell culture dish and scrape the adherent cells into a new 1.5 mL tube. Centrifuge at 800 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\nDuring the centrifugation, prepare 5 mL mitochondrial isolation buffer (250 mM sucrose, 10 mM HEPES(4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazine ethanesulfonic acid), 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA) supplemented with 50 μL of protease inhibitors stock solution (100x concentration; 1 EDTA-free tablet dissolved in 500 µL of ddH2O).\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 1 mL of mitochondrial isolation buffer. Incubate the 1.5 mL tube on ice for 30 min.\nLyse the suspended cells with a glass homogenizer (15 - 25 strokes) up and down manually on ice.\n\tNOTE: Make sure there are no bubbles when cells are homogenized. Count the intact cells and bared nuclei by microscope visually and confirm that >90% cell breakage has occurred.\nTransfer the homogenate into a 1.5 mL tube and centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove the debris (nuclei and remaining intact cells).",
    "Transfer the supernatant into a new 1.5 mL tube and centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 5 min 4 °C.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new tube and centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 15 min 4 °C.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet containing mitochondria with 1 mL of mitochondrial isolation buffer.\nCentrifuge the solution for 15 min at 14,000 x g 4 °C to precipitate the mitochondria.\nThe resulting mitochondria pellet must be kept on ice and resuspended in 50 - 100 μL KCl media (125 mM KCl, 2 mM K2HPO4, 1 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, 5 mM glutamate, 5 mM malate, and 2 μM rotenone, pH 7.4) according to the pellet volume before any assay.\nUse 5 μL of mitochondrial solution to measure the mitochondrial protein concentration by standard BCA assay, measuring OD562 using a plate reader13.\n2. Determination of Mitochondrial Ca2+  Retention Capacity\nPrepare the KCl media and add the Ca2+-binding green fluorescent dye to a final concentration of 0.5 μM before the experiment.\nTransfer 1 mL of isolated mitochondria (0.4 mg/mL) in KCl media containing 0.5 μM Ca2+-binding green fluorescent dye into each 6-well plate well.\nIncubate the mitochondria and the Ca2+-binding green fluorescent dye in the 6-well plate at room temperature protected from ambient light for 1 min. Add 4 μL aliquots of a 20 mM CaCl2 solution (20 mM CaCl2, 127 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, 5 mM glutamate, 5 mM malate, pH 7.4) to each 6-well plate well using the automatic dispense setting to introduce 200 nmol Ca2+/mg mitochondrial protein.",
    "Use a fluorescence spectrometer to monitor the fluorescence changes every 3 s for 2 min with an excitation wavelength of 506 nm and an emission wavelength of 531 nm. The plate is equipped with shaking at 600 rpm for 3 s between readings controlled by software (Figure 1).\nAdd an additional 4 μL aliquot of 20 mM CaCl2 solution to each well and monitor the fluorescence changes every 3 s for 2 min. Repeat this step until the fluorescence increases with time.\n\tNOTE: Mitochondria are challenged with the added Ca2+ indicated by the increased recording fluorescence. When the mPTP opens, the fluorescence increases with time.\nInterpret the total amount of Ca2+ added until the mPTP opens as the Ca2+ retention capacity.\n3. Determination of Ca 2+-induced Mitochondrial Swelling\nPrepare the KCl media before the experiment.\n\t\nTransfer 1 mL of isolated mitochondria (0.4 mg/mL) in KCl media into each 6-well plate well.\nAdd 10 μL of 20 mM CaCl2 aqueous solution (500 nmol/mg mitochondrial protein) into mitochondrial protein to trigger mitochondrial swelling.\nRecord the decrease in absorbance at 540 nm every 3 s on a microplate reader controlled by software for 10 min (Figure 2). The fluorescence changes are caused by an influx of solutes across the mitochondrial inner membrane.\n\tNOTE: The decreased absorbance at 540 nm corresponds to the swollen mitochondria. If the reader does not observe a decrease in absorbance, a longer reading interval or reading time can be adopted.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
