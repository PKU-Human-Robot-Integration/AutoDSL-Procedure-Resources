The subsequent step involves the propagation of MDV-infected CEC monolayers.\nPropagate CEC monolayers to a confluency of 80–90% (usually 1–2 days, depending on the cell passage used).\nTrypsinize cells and mix 1–2 × 106 of the CEC with MDV-infected CEC (3 × 104 plaque-forming units [pfu]) per 6-well (∼9.6 m2).\nSeed cell mixture in 6-wells and incubate at 37°C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 3–4 days.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2733-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. MDV infection of CEC\n(A and B) Representative bright-field and fluorescence microscopy images of (A) mock-infected and (B) highly infected CEC monolayers. Cells were infected with 3 × 104 pfu of a GFP-tagged MDV. The images were captured on day 4 post-infection using a Zeiss Axio Vert.A1 microscope with a magnification of 100x (scale bar: 100 μm).\nAlternatives: Prepare frozen MDV stocks with very high titers (1 mL with ± 1 × 106 pfu), as efficient infection of lymphocytes can also be achieved by co-seeding of B- or T-cells with these stocks.\nCritical: The CEC monolayers have to be intact and highly infected (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). To obtain highly infected frozen MDV stocks, infect larger cell culture dishes (e.g. 15 cm dishes) with 3 × 104 pfu for 3–4 days until the culture is completely infected. Next, trypsinize the cells and use them to infect fresh or passaged CEC (at a 1-to-5 ratio) for another 2–3 days until almost all cells are infected.",
    "Note: These cells can then either be directly used for co-seeding infections or frozen at −80°C or LN2 using a cryoprotective agent such as DMSO following standard protocols.17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]\nThe infected CEC stocks can be used for titrations, overlay infections and infection by co-seeding. It is key that the infected cells of the virus stocks are highly infected but also possess a high viability.\nIsolation of primary chicken B- and T-lymphocytes\nTiming: 3 h\nThe following steps describe the process for isolating primary chicken B-cells from the bursa of Fabricius (or T-cells from the thymus) as described by Martin et al.,18[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18] Schermuly et al.,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] and Bertzbach et al.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]\nHomogenize the bursa/thymus through a 40 μm cell strainer to obtain a uniform single-cell suspension.\nLeave at room temperature for 10 min to ensure cell clumps and cells with higher densities to sediment (i.e., inter alia, connective tissue cells, fibroblasts, erythrocytes).\nNext, carefully apply the supernatant (suspension cells) onto a lymphocyte separating solution (density 1.077 g/mL) and spin for 12 min at 650 × g with slow acceleration and deactivated deceleration.\nCarefully transfer lymphocytes at the interphase into a new tube.\nWash lymphocytes with PBS, and maintain cells in the respective growth medium at 41°C and 5% CO2.\nActivate cells following the same descriptions (Martin et al.,18[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18] Schermuly et al.,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] and Bertzbach et al.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) using recombinant soluble chicken CD40L (2 μg/mL) for B-cells and anti-chicken TCR alpha/beta (Vß1) antibody (5 μg/mL; e.g., clone TCR-2-coated plate).\nAlternatives: Grow suspension cell cultures of chicken B- or T-cell lines.\nCritical: The primary lymphocytes should be isolated just before their in vitro infection (ideally within 1 h before infection). The cultures of the lymphocyte cell lines should have a high viability (>90%).\nOverlay infection using MDV-infected CEC monolayers\nTiming: 3–4 days",
    "As the first alternative, we present a detailed step-by-step protocol for infecting chicken lymphocytes via an overlay infection method using MDV-infected CEC monolayers.\nGrow highly infected CEC monolayers (using 30,000 pfu per 6-well).\nMicroscopically monitor virus replication for 3–4 days until the whole monolayer is infected.\nSeed 1 × 106 to 1 × 107 of the lymphocytes per well onto the infected CEC and incubate at 41°C and 5% CO2 for 16 h.\nNote: For optimal contact with infected CEC and even distribution of the lymphocytes, gently sway the cell culture dish 1–2 h post seeding of the lymphocytes.\nCarefully remove suspension cells with the cell culture supernatant and pellet them at 250 × g for 5 min.\nNote: For a better lymphocyte yield, a PBS-wash can be used to collect lymphocytes that remained on the CEC monolayer after the first harvest of the suspension cells.\nResuspend the pellet in growth medium and culture the resuspended cells at 41°C and 5% CO2 to allow the remaining carryover CEC to adhere overnight.\nNote: Alternatively, the cells can be directly FACS-sorted to obtain a pure infected lymphocyte population.\nCritical: As mentioned above, the CEC monolayers have to be intact and highly infected. The primary lymphocytes should be isolated just before the overlay infection. The cultures of the lymphocyte cell lines should have a high viability (>90%, measured e.g. by FACS).\nInfection via co-seeding of lymphocytes with frozen MDV-infected CEC\nTiming: 17–25 h\nAs a second alternative, we present step-by-step details for an infection through co-seeding of lymphocytes with frozen MDV-infected CEC.\nThaw the frozen cryovial with the infected CEC in a water bath at 37°C (shake the cryovial until only very small ice crystals are left).\nTransfer the content of the cryovial into a 50 mL falcon.",
    "Add PBS or medium without FBS (very slowly, drop by drop, continuously shake the falcon tube – the cells are quite fragile) and fill the tube up to 50 mL.\nCentrifuge at 250 × g for 10 min at room temperature.\nCarefully remove (decant) supernatant.\nResuspend the infected cell pellet in 5 mL of your lymphocyte suspension (1 × 107 cells per mL).\nNote: Alternatively, the lymphocytes can be directly seeded into the wells before adding the respective amount of suspended infected CEC.\nPlate CEC/lymphocyte mix in wells of a 24-well plate, 1 mL of the suspension per well.\nIncubate the cells at 41°C and 5% CO2 for 16–24 h.\nProceed with FACS or any other downstream analysis, following steps 13–14 of the overlay protocol above.\nCritical: The CEC should be highly viable at freezing and have a high pfu. The freezing media (with its DMSO) has to be removed completely during the washing (steps 15–19) to avoid carryover resulting in lymphocyte death. Again, the primary lymphocytes should be isolated just before the infection. The cultures of the lymphocyte cell lines should have the highest viabilities (>90%)."
