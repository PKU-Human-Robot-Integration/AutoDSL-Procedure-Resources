    "Ethics statement: All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animal care was according to institutional guidelines. ICR female mice (7 - 8 weeks old; 25 - 30 g) were housed in air conditioned, light controlled animal facilities of the Sackler Faculty of Medicine in Tel-Aviv University. At term, animals were euthanized with anesthesia overdose.\n1. Fibred Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy (FCFM) Calibration\nTurn the device ON.\nConnect the microprobe (mini0/30).\nCalibrate the device according to manufacturer’s instructions.\n2. Mice Preparation for Imaging \nAnesthetize by a subcutaneous injection of both Ketaset (100 mg/kg) and XYL-M2 (6 mg/kg). Confirm proper anesthetization by unresponsiveness to toe-pinch.\nIncise the skin below the groin in order to reveal the femoral arterial vessels. Keep the incision site moist with saline following incision.\nHeat the tail by using a bag (or a glove) filled with warm water (not too hot to touch) for approximately 30 sec. Prepare an intravenous (IV) shunt for administration of FITC dextran (a contrast agent) and of either saline or chemotherapeutic agent, by inserting a needle (30 G, 1/2 inch) into the tail vein and attaching a 1 ml syringe to it. Ensure the vein is open by injecting saline.\n\tNOTE: An IV administration of FITC dextran (high molecular weight; 100 µl; 10 mg/ml; 2,000 kDa) facilitates visualizing the femoral microvasculature by FCFM. Doxorubicin (100 µl; 8 mg/kg, Adriamycin) or saline will also be later administered IV into the pre-heated tail vein.\nPosition the mouse supinely on a polystyrene stage. Secure the mouse to the pad and maintain position using surgical duct tape.\n3. Imaging of Femoral Blood Vessels by FCFM During and After Administration of Doxorubicin or Saline",
    "NOTE: The fibered confocal microscope used in this study is composed of two units: (1) microprobe (mini0/30). (2) Laser scanning unit (LSU-488; 488 nm wavelength).\nPerform all time-laps analyses using the LSU 488 nm wavelength laser. \n\tNOTE: The main unit detector detects the filtered (500 - 650 nm) emitted fluorescence. The acquired images are reconstructed afterwards and displayed at a rate of 12 frames/sec.\nDisconnect carefully the syringe from the needle and attach a new syringe containing FITC dextran. Administer (IV) 100 µl of FITC dextran.\nShift the microprobe (mini0/30) to a suitable field of view and fixate it, following adjustment to the z-axis, in order to obtain the corresponding image. Wait for the initial signal to fade until a clear and focused signal is visible.\nRecord a baseline blood flow for a short stabilization period (~30 sec). Then connect to the needle another syringe, containing either doxorubicin or saline. IV administer 100 µl doxorubicin or saline.\nMonitor the flow of injected FITC-dextran continuously for 20 min. On the FCFM-associated software, use the diameter button on the upper ruler in order to measure the blood vessels and categorize them as small (<15 µm) or large (>15 µm).\nEuthanize the animal with anesthesia overdose.\nSubscription Required.
