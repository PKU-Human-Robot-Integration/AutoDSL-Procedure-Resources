    "1.Scaffold Fabrication and Sterilization\nDissolve PCL in 1,1,1,3,3,3–hexafluoroisopropanol to give a 10% w/v concentration. As described in Bosworth et al.,9 electrospin the polymeric solution (parameters: 20 kV, 1 ml/hr, 20 cm) and collect aligned fibers on the edge of a rotating mandrel (600 rpm). With a scalpel remove the ribbon of collected fiber and then cut into shorter lengths - 3 cm (for troughs and rotary vessels) and 4 cm (for cell culture inserts) lengths.\nUsing fine forceps submerge individual strips in distilled water and remove.\nHolding both ends between thumb and forefinger; manually twist the strip until it resembles thread.\nBriefly submerge this thread-like scaffold in distilled water and place on clean, non-fibrous card to dry.\nOnce dry, place individually in clean microcentrifuge tubes and add 1 ml of 50% v/v ethanol in distilled water. Close the lids and leave for 24 hr.\n\tNote: Perform the following steps under laminar flow:\nPlace microcentrifuge tubes in a laminar flow cabinet and aspirate the 50% v/v solution. Replace with 1 ml 70% v/v ethanol in distilled water, close lids and leave for 24 hr.\nRepeat for 90% and 100% v/v ethanol in distilled water (1 ml volumes).\nWash scaffolds twice with phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS), 24 hr per wash (2 x 1 ml).\nRemove PBS and replace with 1 ml cell culture media. Note: Scaffolds are ready for use post-24 hr.\n2 . Determining Scaffold Surface Area and Number of Cells\nUsing a light microscope and imaging software, measure the diameter of the electrospun yarn along its length to determine a mean value.\nAssume the yarn to be a cylindrical rod and approximate the surface area using:\nWhere A = Surface area, r = radius and h = length",
    "Note: The surface area was calculated to be 18,902,800 µm2. Furthermore, it should be noted that the actual surface area will be greater than this calculation as the yarn is composed of hundreds of fine fibers, which will increase the surface area. Consequently a larger number of cells should be able to attach to the scaffold. However, this does not affect a direct comparison between test groups being made.\nDetermine the maximum number of cells that could attach to the exposed scaffold surface by:\n\tNote: Using a light microscope and imaging software, the diameter of human mesenchymal stem cells was determined to be 20 µm (assuming cells are round), therefore in this case, number of cells = 60,200.\n3. Scaffold Set-up – Cell Culture Inserts (Figure 1A)\nUnder laminar flow, open the sterile 6-well cell culture inserts and separate the shorter rings with teeth from the wider ringed bodies.\nTake the ring with teeth pointing upwards. Drape one of the 4 cm scaffolds over the centre of the ring making sure it overlaps on both sides. Take the ringed body and position over the toothed ring and scaffold and push downwards making sure the scaffold stays in position and lies through the centre of the cell culture insert.\nPlace the cell culture insert with scaffold into the well of a 6-well, low binding plate.\nAdd 10 ml of culture media to the scaffold.\n4. Scaffold Set-up – Trough (Figure 1B)\nUnder laminar flow, place poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) troughs into individual petri dishes and add 10 ml of culture media to the trough.\nUsing forceps drape one of the 3 cm scaffolds into the trough, making sure its length lies parallel to the trough’s longer edge.\n5. Scaffold Set-up – Bioreactor Vessel (Figure 1C)",
    "Under laminar flow, dispense 10 ml sterile PBS through the bioreactor vessel’s main port and leave for 10 min.\nRemove the PBS and replace with 8 ml culture media.\nUsing forceps, insert one of the 3 cm scaffolds into the vessel via the main port.\nClose off the main port.\n6. Cell Counting\nCulture human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) derived from bone marrow according to manufacturer protocol up to passage 4 prior to harvesting.\nAspirate the media from a 75 cm2 flask containing hMSCs derived from bone marrow (passage 4, 80% confluency).\nWash the cells with 10 ml sterile PBS and aspirate.\nAdd 3 ml trypsin and incubate the flask at 37 °C, 5% CO2 until the cells have dislodged from the flask surface.\nAdd 7 ml culture media to inactivate the enzyme and transfer this total volume (10 ml) to a centrifuge tube.\nResuspend this cell suspension by pipetting up and down several times to homogeneously disperse cells within the media and limit cell agglomerates (10 ml pipette).\nRemove 20 µl of cell suspension and transfer to a haemocytometer.\nPlace the haemocytometer under a light microscope and image at x10 objective.\nFocus the gridlines and count the number of cells in the 4 x 4 squares in each corner of the grid and which fall within the square and those that cross the right hand or bottom boundary line. Count for each set of 4 x 4 squares (4 counts per grid).\nRepeat the resuspension and cell count three times (steps 6.6-6.9).",
    "Calculate the average cell count and determine the volume of media required for cell resuspension (cell concentration 60,200 in 200 µl). For example, determine the average cell count from the haemocytometer and then determine the overall average number of cells from the three separate counts. Multiply this by 1 x 104 to give number of cells per ml and then multiply by the total volume of cell suspension to give total number of cells. Use the following equation to determine volume of media required for resuspension:\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 241 x g for 5 min.\n7. Cell Seeding\nAspirate the media from the centrifuged tube leaving the cell pellet and replace with the calculated media volume.\nResuspend the cells and media for an even mix.\nUsing a P200 Gilson pipette, slowly dispense 200 µl of cell suspension onto each scaffold by running the tip of the pipette along the scaffold length and below the media liquid surface. Leave undisturbed for 20 min.\nFor bioreactor vessels, dispense 200 µl of cell suspension through the main port. Top-up the remaining 2 ml culture media via the syringe ports to give a total volume of 10 ml.\n8. Experimental Start\nTransfer the bioreactor vessels to the RCCS-4DQ bioreactor and set to rotate at 9 rpm.\nTransfer the well plates with cell culture inserts and troughs to the shaker plate and set to rotate at 30 rpm.\nTransfer the well plates with cell culture inserts and troughs to the shelf of a cell incubator set at 37 °C, 5% CO2 (static culture).\n9. DNA Assay\nPrepare solutions – lysis buffer, 1x TE buffer, DNA standards and cell DNA working solution - as per the manufacturer instructions.\nAfter 4 hr, remove the samples from the incubator and place under laminar flow.",
    "Remove the media fractions from all samples and place in separately labelled centrifuge tubes. Centrifuge the tubes 241 x g . Remove the supernatant and add 3 ml lysis buffer. Resuspend the solution to break-up the cell pellet.\nUsing forceps remove the scaffolds and place in centrifuge tubes containing 3 ml lysis buffer (for the scaffolds within the bioreactor vessels, remove the scaffold prior to aspirating the media). For scaffolds held within cell culture inserts, first free the scaffold by cutting the scaffold close to the insert’s edge using a scalpel.\nAdd 3 ml of lysis buffer to each scaffold receptacle and scrape the surface (vigorously agitate for the bioreactor vessels). Remove the lysis buffer and place in separately labelled centrifuge tubes.\nVortex each centrifuge tube for approximately 1 min to ensure sufficient agitation of the cells and buffer and to encourage lysis of the cell membrane.\nIn a black 96 well plate, add 100 µl of lysis buffer for each sample fraction – scaffold, media and well (duplicate).\nIn the dark, add 100 µl of cell DNA solution to all wells containing lysis buffer and mix gently.\nInclude wells with lysis buffer containing no DNA and cell DNA solution to provide a negative and positive control for the well plate.\nUsing a fluorescence plate-reader, measure the absorbance of the wells using 485 nm excitation and 520 nm emission.\nCompare the data with the standard curve generated from the DNA standards as per the manufacturer instructions.\n10. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) Fixation\nPerform the following steps under laminar flow: After 4 hr, remove all scaffolds from their receptacles and place within a new 6-well plate (separate wells).\nWash the scaffolds twice with PBS.",
    "Perform the following steps on the open bench: To each well, add 2 ml of 1.5% v/v glutaraldehyde in PBS to ensure complete coverage of the scaffold.\nLeave the plate for minimum 30 min at 4 °C for cell fixation.\nRemove the fixative solution and wash the scaffolds twice with PBS.\nDehydrate the scaffolds with increasing concentrations of ethanol in distilled water starting with 50% v/v, followed by 70% v/v and 90% v/v. For each concentration, fully submerse the scaffolds in solution (2 ml) and leave for 3 min. Discard the solution and repeat.\nDehydrate in 100% ethanol by fully submersing the scaffolds in solution (2 ml) and leaving for 5 min. Discard the solution and repeat.\nChemically dry the scaffolds using hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) within a fume cupboard. Immerse the scaffolds in HMDS (2 ml) and leave for 5 min. Remove the HMDS and repeat.\nRemove the HMDS and allow the scaffolds to dry. Mount the scaffolds on commercially available SEM stubs (in this case stainless steel stubs with adhesive carbon tabs).\nTo ease viewing within the SEM, coat the samples using a gold-sputter coater for 2 min to ensure a thin and even coverage.\nPlace samples within the SEM and visualize the cell-seeded scaffolds using a 5 KeV electron beam."
