    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nNuclei isolation and nuclear run-on\nTiming: 1 day\nNuclei were isolated by the Percoll gradient procedure as previously described except that the concentration of Triton X-100 was reduced to 0.5% (Zhu et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). For tissues that have not been tested, pilot experiments are required to optimize the concentration of Triton X-100, which dissolves the plasma membrane and chloroplasts and leaves the nucleus intact. In vitro nuclear run-on and nascent RNA purification were performed as previously reported (Zhu et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nNuclei isolation.\nPrepare nuclei isolation buffer, gradient buffer, 80% Percoll solution, 30% Percoll solution, 10× transcription buffer, 1× transcription buffer and nuclei storage buffer, keep on ice.\nGrind leaf tissue with liquid nitrogen to fine powder and dispense into 3 mL aliquots. Add 20 mL cold nuclei isolation buffer to each of three replicates. Mix well and put on ice for 10–15 min. Shake the tube gently every 3 min.\nPlace 2 layers of nylon mesh (1 layer of 100 μm mesh on the top, 1 layer of 40 μm mesh at the bottom) over the top of a 50 mL centrifuge tube and decant the sample through the mesh. Add nuclei isolation buffer to the filtrate to a final volume of 20 mL.\nPrepare a discontinuous Percoll gradient by layering 6 mL 30% Percoll over 6 mL 80% Percoll in a 50 mL tube. Be careful and do not disrupt the 80%–30% interface.\nGently pipette the filtered plant extract onto the top of the 30% Percoll layer. Centrifuge the gradient at 2,000 × g for 11 min at 4°C with a swing bucket at a low accelerating and de-accelerating level (±3).\nRemove the top layer of nuclei isolation buffer and use a Pasteur pipette to collect nuclei at the 30%–80% interface.",
    "Add cold gradient buffer to the enriched nuclei to a total volume of 20 mL, centrifuge at 2,000 × g for 6 min at 4°C.\nGently draw off the supernatant, then resuspend the pellet with 1 mL 1× transcription buffer (pre-cold). Transfer the nuclei to a new 1.5 mL tube, centrifuge at 3,000 × g for 3 min at 4°C.\nRepeat step h. Then wash nuclei with 1 mL nuclei storage buffer (pre-cold), centrifuge at 5,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nPause point: Proceed to “Nuclear Run-On” or store nuclei at −80°C. If properly stored, frozen nuclei can be used several weeks after collection.\nNuclear Run-On and RNA extraction.\nResuspend nuclei with 100 μL nuclei storage buffer, and add 100 μL 2× reaction buffer, mix well (stir the pellet first with 200 μL tip, then pipette the pellet gently for 30 times). Incubate at 30°C for 5 min immediately. Br-UTP is incorporated into the nascent RNA at this step.\nAdd 750 μL TRIzol reagent to stop the reaction. Vortex for 60 s and incubate at room temperature (∼25°C) for 5–10 min. Add 200 μL chloroform and vortex for 30 s. Spin at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Transfer the aqueous phase (upper phase) into a new 1.5 mL tube and add 500 μL chloroform, vortex for 30 s.\nSpin at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Transfer the aqueous phase (∼560 μL) into two new 1.5 mL tubes (∼280 μL each). Add 28 μL (1/10 volume) 5 M NH4OAc, 1 μL glycol-blue (15 μg/μL), 840 μL (3 volumes) 100% EtOH (pre-cold) and mix well by vortexing. Incubate at −80°C for at least two hours or overnight (6–8 h).",
    "Pellet the nuclear RNA from step c by spinning at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C.\nDiscard supernatant and wash the pellet with 1 mL 75% ethanol (pre-cold). Spin at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant.\nRepeat step e. Then spin briefly and remove the residual 75% EtOH with a 10 μL pipette. Air-dry the pellet for 5–10 min.\nDissolve the RNA in 14 μL DEPC-H2O and store at −80°C.\nCritical: All the buffers and reaction mixtures should be prepared and kept on ice; As PMSF is toxic, wear gloves while handling.\nRibosomal RNA (rRNA) removal\nTiming: 2–3 h\nThe rRNA removal step after nuclear RNA isolation and before the affinity purification of nascent RNA is performed according to riboPOOL kit (siTOOLs Biotech) manual with some modifications.\nPreparation of streptavidin beads.\nResuspend the Streptavidin Magpoly Beads by carefully vortexing at medium speed.\nTransfer 100 μL bead suspension per sample to a new 1.5 mL tube. To prepare multiple samples, aliquot bead suspension for 3 samples (i.e., 300 μL) to a single tube.\nPlace tube on magnetic rack, aspirate supernatant.\nAdd 100 μL depletion buffer per sample (i.e., 300 μL for 3 samples) and resuspend the beads.\nPlace on magnetic rack, aspirate supernatant.\nRepeat step d and e.\nResuspend beads in 40 μL depletion buffer per sample (i.e., 120 μL for 3 samples). Leave the beads at room temperature (∼25°C) until use.\nHybridization of riboPOOL to RNA.\nTo the 14 μL RNA sample from step 2g add and mix 1 μL riboPOOL and 5 μL hybridization buffer.\nIncubate at 68°C for 10 min to denature RNA.\nAllow to cool slowly from 68°C to 37°C (3°C/min) for optimal hybridization.\nrRNA depletion.",
    "Briefly centrifuge the tube containing ∼20 μL hybridized riboPOOL and nuclear RNA (from step 4c).\nDispense 40 μL beads (from step 3) to the hybridized riboPOOL/RNA solution and mix well by pipette.\nIncubate at 37°C for 15 min, follow by a 50°C incubation for 5 min. Pipette the mixture every 5 min.\nBriefly spin down droplets and place the tube on magnetic rack. Very carefully transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 mL tube.\nBeads clean-up: add 90 μL (1.8×) AMPure Beads to the supernatant and mix well by pipette; immediately add 270 μL isopropanol and mix well by pipette; incubate for 5 min at room temperature (∼25°C) and magnetize sample for 5 min or until solution appears clear; discard supernatant and wash the beads by 180 μL 80% EtOH twice; spin briefly and remove the residual 80% EtOH. Air dry the beads for 3–5 min. Remove the tube from the magnetic rack and resuspend the beads in 20 μL DEPC-H2O by pipetting volume up and down. Incubate the bead suspension for 3 min at room temperature (∼25°C). Magnetize sample for 3 min and transfer 20 μL supernatant to a new tube.\nPause point: Proceed to “RNA immunoprecipitation” or store RNA at −80°C (stable for up to a month).\nCritical: Always use freshly prepared 80% ethanol and do not incubate the beads with 80% ethanol for more than 30 s.\nRNA immunoprecipitation\nTiming: 6–8 h\nThe rRNA depleted nuclear RNA is subject to RNA fragmentation, DNA removal and de-phosphorylation sequentially. Then, Br-UTP containing nascent RNA is affinity purified using anti-BrdU antibodies.\nAnti-BrdU antibody conjugation to magnetic beads.\nPrepare binding buffer.\nResuspend the Dynabeads™ M-280 Sheep Anti-Mouse IgG by carefully vortexing at medium speed.\nTransfer 50 μL bead suspension per sample to a new 1.5 mL tube.",
    "Place tube on magnetic rack, aspirate supernatant.\nResuspend the beads in 1 mL binding buffer and add 30 μL anti-BrdU antibody (IIB5) per sample. Rotate at 4°C for 4–6 h. (During this step, proceed to steps 7 and 8).\nRNA fragmentation and purification.\nThe rRNA depleted nuclear RNA from step 5e (20 μL) is subjected to base hydrolysis by adding 5 μL 1 M NaOH (freshly prepared) and incubate on ice for 40 min. Then add 25 μL 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) to neutralize the reaction.\nRNA is desalted through a p-30 RNase-free spin column, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.bio-rad.com/sites/default/files/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/10000069982.pdf[href=https://www.bio-rad.com/sites/default/files/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/10000069982.pdf]).\nDNA removal and de-phosphorylation.\nAdjust the eluted RNA volume to 50 μL with DEPC-H2O. Then add 6.7 μL DNase buffer and 3.5 μL RNase-free DNase (2 U/mL, 2238G2), mix by vortexing. Briefly spin down droplets and incubate at 37°C for 30 min.\nRNA is purified again through a p-30 column.\nAdjust the eluted RNA volume to 70 μL. Then add 8.5 μL 10× antarctic phosphatase buffer, 1 μL RNase Inhibitor (Promega, N2615) and 5 μL antarctic phosphatase to the fragmented RNA and incubate for 1 h at 37°C. (During this step, proceed to step 9).\nImmunoprecipitation.\nPrepare binding buffer, blocking buffer, low salt buffer, high salt buffer, and TET buffer, keep on ice.\nPut the tube containing antibody conjugated beads (from step 6e) on magnetic rack and aspirate the supernatant.

    "After binding, spin at 1,500 × g for 5 min at 4°C, remove supernatant. Then beads are washed once in 1 mL low salt buffer, twice in high salt buffer and twice in TET buffer at 4°C with 5 min rotation.\nElute the BrU-incorporated RNA in 250 μL elution buffer at room temperature (∼25°C) with 10 min rotation.\nAdd 800 μL TRIzol reagent to stop elution. Vortex for 1 min and incubate at room temperature (∼25°C) for 5–10 min. Add 200 μL chloroform and vortex for 30 s. Spin at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.

    "Ethanol precipitation of RNA refers to step 2c.\nLibrary construction.\nPellet and wash the RNA (from step 10e) as described in steps 2d–f.\nDissolve the RNA in 10.5 μL DEPC-H2O and proceed to small library construction using NEXTflex™ Small RNA-Seq Kit v3 according to the manufacturer’s manual exactly except for the PCR amplification (https://perkinelmer-appliedgenomics.com/wp-content/uploads/marketing/NEXTFLEX/small_rna/5132-05-NEXTflex-Small-RNA-Seq-v3_19.01.pdf[href=https://perkinelmer-appliedgenomics.com/wp-content/uploads/marketing/NEXTFLEX/small_rna/5132-05-NEXTflex-Small-RNA-Seq-v3_19.01.pdf]):\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1945_15.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1945_16.csv\nNote: Run for 5 cycles first, then take out 5 μL sample (keep the remaining 35 μL PCR sample mix on ice) and use KAPA HiFi Real-time PCR Library Amplification Kit to determinate the remaining PCR N cycle number to generate optimal library for sequencing. Add 5 μL 2× KAPA PCR mix to the 5 μL sample, mixed well. Take out 10 μL standard control 1–4, two repeats each. Choose the N cycles which make sure the sample fluorescence is between standard control 1 and standard control 3 fluorescence. Lastly amplify the remaining 35 μL PCR sample mix for additional N cycles (normally no more than 10 cycles). It is not recommended to over amplify the sample.\nGel recovery.\nTo make an 8% polyacrylamide TBE gel (non-denaturing), mix the follow items in a 15 mL corning tube: 2.2 mL 5× TBE, 2.2 mL 40% polyacrylamide stock solution, fill up to 11 mL with ddH2O, mix well; then add 66 μL 10% APS, 5.1 μL TEMED, mix well. Put the mixture into a 1.5 mm thick glass cassette (Bio-Rad protein system IV) with a 10-well comb. Wait for half an hour.\nAdd 6 μL of 6× loading buffer (provided by NEXTflex™ Small RNA-Seq Kit v3) to the PCR product (from step 11b).",
    "Resolve the PCR product on the gel, then electrophoresis at 130 V for 1–2 h in 1× TBE electrophoresis solution till the Xylene Cyanol reach the middle of gel and the Bromophenol Blue go off the gel. Stain the gel with SYBR® Gold Nucleic Acid Gel Stain /TBE (1/10,000) for 5–15 min.\nTake picture of the gel and excise the gel slices between 170 bp and 330 bp (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Recover the cDNA by soaking the grinded gel (use a fire sealed 1 mL tip) in 400 μL DNA gel elution buffer (300 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA) overnight (6–8 h) at 30°C on thermo rotator (1,200× rpm).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1945-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. rRNA removal GRO-seq cDNA resolved on a PAGE\nLeft, a typical PAGE of rRNA removal GRO-seq cDNA library.

Molecular weight and adapter self-ligation product are indicated.\nPass the gel through a 0.45 μm spin column by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 5 min (Corning, V123041), then precipitate the cDNA by adding: 1 μL glycol-blue (15 μg/μL), 35 μL (1/10 volume) 3 M NaOAc, 1,050 μL (3 volumes) 100% EtOH. Incubate at −80°C for at least two hours or overnight (6–8 h).\nPellet, wash and resuspend the cDNA as described in steps 2d–g.\nCritical: Resolving the PCR product on a TBE native PAGE can serve as a check point for library preparation. Optionally, to save time and simplify operations, experienced experimenters can use magnetic beads for size selection instead of gel recovery if there is no obvious adapter self-ligation.\nQuality check of the cDNA library.\nQuantify the library by Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit according to the manufacturer’s manual (https://www.thermofisher.cn/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.cn/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FQubit_dsDNA_HS_Assay_UG.pdf[href=https://www.thermofisher.cn/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.cn/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FQubit_dsDNA_HS_Assay_UG.pdf]) and check the size distribution with a Fragment Analyzer."
