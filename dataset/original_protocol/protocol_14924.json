    "NOTE: Male Wistar rats (mean body weight: 356 ± 44 g; 10-14 weeks old) were housed in the animal room at 22-24 °C and twelve hour light/dark cycle with free access to pellet diet, regular tap water and also received humane care in conformity with institutional guidelines. The experiments were reviewed and approved by the Committee for Animal Welfare at the University of Helsinki, Finland.  \nNOTE: In the following demonstration our surgical method is as follows: Anesthetize the rat by weight-adapted subcutaneous injection of medetomidine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) and intraperitoneal injection of ketamine hydrochloride (50 mg/kg). Test for the lack of a toe-pinch reflex to confirm that the rat is fully anesthetized. Apply eye ointment, clip the surgical site, and clean the skin with a suitable disinfectant, for example Chlorhexidine, either in alcohol or water. Wash hands, put on protective clothing, a head cover and facemask, and sterile surgical gloves. Have a surgical assistant aid in maintaining aseptic surgery conditions and to document the surgical characteristics (as listed in Table 1). Monitor the depth of the anesthesia every 15 min during surgery by following respiratory rate, heart rate, and reaction to noxious stimulation (toe pinch test). Subcutaneous injection of buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg) was given for postoperative analgesia and repeated if necessary every 12 hr.\n1. Hardware, Consumables, and Positioning\nKeep the small animal surgery room quiet, aseptic, and maintain the room temperature at 23 +/- 3 °C. To perform the experimental aneurysm surgery the following minimal equipment is necessary:\n\t\nUse a table top surgical microscope ideally equipped with an assistant scope and digital microscope camera. Use nonporous reusable operating surface and cleanable instrument surface to protect the laboratory bench.",
    "Prepare consumables such as skin disinfectants, physiological saline, smaller and larger gauze swabs and suture material including 9-0 micro-sutures, a 5-0 non-absorbable, and 3-0 absorbable suture.\nUse the following standard surgical instruments: Surgical scissors, tissue forceps, soft tissue spreader or self-retaining retractor, and two Mosquito surgical clamps.\nUse a basic microsurgical instrument set that includes: Curved microneedle holder, one curved and two straight microforceps, and a straight or curved microscissor.\nKeep the microsurgical instruments in a kidney dish filled with sterile saline to keep the instrument non-sticky and clean during surgery. The kidney dish is padded with rubber mat or a surgical glove to prevent damage to the tips of the micro-instruments. Ensure that all supplies are sterile and the procedure is performed with aseptic technique according to the current recommendations for survival surgery on laboratory animals8-10.\nIn addition, use a vascular clip applicator and three atraumatic temporary vascular clamps. It is important that the clamps used have a low closing power to prevent injury to the very thin wall of the rat aorta. Also prepare a ruler with half millimeter scale bars, a small colored rubber pad, and a short blunt needle.\nPlace the rats in a supine position, immobilize both front and hind paws with surgical tape without applying stretch or compression to the skin, and bend their back with a thick marker or cautery pen by placing it under the lumber region of the back. It is important to obtain as much lumbar spine lordosis as possible in order to improve retroperitoneal exposure and access to the infrarenal aorta which facilitates microsurgical anastomosis. This positioning is recommended for abdominal aorta aneurysm creation but not necessary for thoracic graft harvesting.\n2. Graft Harvesting",
    "Under general anesthesia, open the thoracic cavity (start graft ischemia time). Apply a noxious toe pinch to confirm that the rat is unresponsive before proceeding with the following steps. Cut through the midventral abdominal wall, identify the diaphragm just above the liver, and cut the connective tissue at the bottom of diaphragm to allow access to the rib cage. With large scissors, blunt side down, cut through ribs just one centimeter left and right of the rib cage midline and open up the thoracic cavity. The lungs are mobilized to the right side of the heart. Sacrifice the rats by overdosing with intracardiac injection of ketamine hydrochloride.Pulmonary trunk, left subclavian vein, left cranial vena cava, and the azygous vein interfere with the harvest of the proximal thoracic aorta.\nCaudal to the prominent veins there is a good entry point to start the dissection of the descending thoracic aorta using micro-scissors and microforceps.\nTrace the thoracic aorta back from the dorsal wall of the thorax upwards to the aortic arch by gentle blunt retraction and dissection with the Mosquito surgical clamp.\nClamp and then cut the veins with scissors. Maintain the clamps on the veins and use as a retractor to expose the underlying aortic arch.\nPlace a non-absorbable 6-0 silk ligature just above the first intercostal artery leaving the aorta.\nCut the descending aorta just below the left subclavian artery and then below the ligature. Trimming can be done in order to get a perpendicular standardized aneurysm geometry, or if needed, to get a specific angle between the axis of the aneurysm and the aorta. Measure the graft in its width and length.",
    "NOTE: Harvested grafts can either be immediately transplanted into recipient rats or further processed to achieve decellularization of the graft wall. Decellularized grafts can be stored at -4 degree Celsius until re-implantation at a later date (Figure 1). The decellularization of the aneurysm wall has been shown to predispose the aneurysm to enlarge11.\n3. Graft Decellularization\nFreeze donor grafts in phosphate buffered saline at -4 °C.\nThe next day, thaw the grafts, rinse with purified and deionized water at room temperature, and incubate for 10 hr at 37 °C in 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate.\nFinally, wash the sodium dodecyl sulfate-treated grafts three times with gentle agitation, refreeze in phosphate buffered saline, and keep at -4 °C until use.\n4. Aneurysm Creation\nDissection of the Abdominal Aorta\n\t\nAfter the animal has been anaesthetized, clip the fur from the surgical site and clean the skin with a suitable disinfectant. Test for the lack of a toe-pinch response prior to skin incision. Start the incision 1cm proximal to the genitals in midventral position (start operation time). Carefully separate the skin from the underlying muscles. End dissection one to two centimeters below the sternum.\nCarefully but firmly pull up the underlying abdominal muscles to avoid damage to the underlying organs. Extend the longitudinal cut along the linea alba upwards to the xiphoid process and end in caudal direction at the level of the bladder.\nGently apply pressure to the bladder to empty it in order to facilitate access to the retroperitoneal space.\nMove the small intestines and the prominent cecum to the right or the left. Identify the large intestine namely the descending colon on the left bottom of the abdominal cavity.",
    "Cut the ligament in between the small intestine and the descending colon in cranial direction to allow wider exposure of the dorsal body wall. Place a self-retaining retractor to hold the bowels apart.\nThe ideal location of end-to-side aneurysm anastomosis is found at the level between the renal and iliolumbar veins. The abdominal aorta lies retroperitoneal embedded in fat tissue. During dissection pay particular attention to the paired almost transparent ureters and testicular vessels.\nIf further retraction of intestines is needed, use larger gauze swaps. The lumbar spine lordosis induced during positioning by placing a cautery pen or similar object under the lower back of the rat, reduces significantly the need of bowel retraction.\nThe ventral surface of the dorsal body wall is covered with a thin parietal peritoneum. Once this is opened, visualize the aorta just underneath. During careful sharp and blunt dissection of the abdominal aorta from adjacent large veins grasp only the adventitia to avoid damage to the vessel wall.\nInfrequently, small lumbar arteries arise as segmental vessel from the dorsal surface of the abdominal aorta and interfere with preparation. Ligation and cutting of the vessel is needed to avoid retrograde oozing during aneurysm suturing. Use of curved micro-forceps can facilitate ligature placement in the depth.\nEnd-to-side Anastomosis\n\t\nPut a colored rubber pad underneath the abdominal aorta and upholster it with a small gauze swab. Remove loose connective tissue and adventitia at the level of the planned anastomosis site.\nClamp the abdominal aorta distal to the anastomosis first, then proximal (start aortic clamping time). This ensures a firm filling of the vessel and facilitates subsequent arteriotomy.\nPerform the arteriotomy using either straight or curved micro-scissors. A micro-forceps holds up a very small piece of the vessel wall to cut out an elliptical shape.",
    "Flush the artery thoroughly with saline in both directions using a blunt tipped needle.\nPlace the first two sutures of this end-to-side anastomosis at the proximal and distal end of the arteriotomy (start anastomosis time). Avoid grasping of the vessel wall with the micro-forceps whenever possible. Make sure that each suture is placed through all layers of the vessel wall.\nPerform suturing either as continuous or interrupted sutures. If interrupted suturing is chosen then place the back side nine o`clock suture first. Subsequent sutures can be spaced apart starting adjacent to the very first suture. Grasp the adventitia carefully. Avoid any squeezing/grasping of the intima.\nWhen the back wall is finished, check the endoluminal part of the anastomosis for misplaced sutures. Perform the same procedures in the same order on the front side. Ensure that the first of a total of three knots per suture is firm but not too tight.\nHemostasis and Closure\n\t\nAfter the end to side anastomosis is completed (end anastomosis time), rinse the site with saline and remove the distal clamp first to allow for backflow (end aortic clamping time and end graft ischemia time).\nIf obvious bleeding occurs from backflow an extra stitch may be needed (start time of hemostasis). In case of minor oozing, achieve hemostasis with gentle pressure over the bleeding site using a small piece of a gauze swab.\nRemove the proximal vascular clamp, rinse the anastomosis site once more, and cut off the remaining ends of the ligature at the aneurysm dome.\nConfirm patency of the aneurysm by observation of volume increase of the aneurysm during peak arterial pulse wave. Assess distal abdominal artery patency through the direct “milking test”.\nRemove the plastic sheet and the small gauze swab underneath. The pulsating blood whirl within the created aneurysm is clearly visible.",
    "Cover suture lines around the anastomosis with small pieces of adipose tissue or Spongostan for additional hemostasis if small oozing is still present (end time of hemostasis).\nRemove the soft-tissue spreader and gauze swabs. Place the small intestines, the cecum, and the fat mass back in their correct position.\nClose the midline abdominal muscles using 5-0, 4-0, or 3-0 resorbable or non-absorbable sutures followed by skin wound closure using continuous suture technique with 3-0 resorbable polyfilament suture (end operation time). Note: In our experience rats tolerated resorbable skin sutures better than non-absorbable monofilament sutures.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
