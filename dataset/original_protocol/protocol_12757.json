    "1. Construction of an U. maydis Trojan Horse\nNOTE: See Figure 1.\nAmplify a gene of interest from maize cDNA using gene-specific primers and a proofreading DNA polymerase. Clone the primary PCR product and transform the construct into E. coli following the plasmid vendor's instructions. Verify the correct gene of interest sequence by Sanger sequencing prior to use for the next cloning steps.\nNOTE: PCR specifications need to be optimized due to primer sequence specificities and optimal DNA polymerase reaction conditions.\nDesign primers to amplify the maize gene of interest without the sequence encoding a signal peptide (SP).\nExtend the 5´ end of the reverse primer with the RSIATA motif and an NcoI cutting site (Table 1).\nAmplify the maize gene of interest with a proofreading DNA polymerase using the PCR construct generated in 1.1 as the PCR template.\nDouble-digest the PCR product and the U. maydis transformation plasmid, p123-PUmpit2-SpUmpit2-Zmmac1-mCherry-Ha15, with XbaI and NcoI. Purify the digested PCR product and plasmid.\nLigate the digested PCR product into the p123-PUmpit2-SpUmpit2-Zmmac1-mCherry-Ha template using T4 DNA ligase following the manufacturer´s instructions. Transform the ligation product into E. coli and verify the correct gene of interest sequence by Sanger sequencing.\nLinearize the p123-PUmpit2-SpUmpit2-Zmgene of interest-mCherry-Ha with the restriction enzyme SspI and transform DNA into the solopathogenic U. maydis strain SG20016. Isolate U. maydis transformants by carboxin selection and confirm isolated transformants by Southern blot analysis16.\nNOTE: For each protein of interest, at least three independent U. maydis transformants should be isolated and analyzed to estimate any phenotype effects of random background mutations.\n2. Culture Media",
    "Prepare YEPSlight liquid medium16: 1.0% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.4% (w/v) Bacto-Peptone, and 0.4% (w/v) sucrose. Dissolve all components in ddH2O and autoclave at 121 °C for 15 min; autoclaving at a higher temperature, for a longer period of time or repeatedly would reduce the quality of the medium.\nPrepare potato-dextrose-agar (PD-agar)20: 3.9% (w/v) potato dextrose agar, and 1.0% (w/v) 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0 (f.c. 0.01 M). Mix all components directly in the bottle for autoclaving and add ddH2O plus a magnetic stir bar. Autoclave at 121 °C for 15 min; autoclaving at a higher temperature, for a longer period of time or repeatedly would reduce the quality of the medium.\nPrepare PD-Charcoal agar20: 3.9% (w/v) potato dextrose agar, 1% (w/v) charcoal, and 1.0% (v/v) 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0 (f.c. 0.01 M). Mix all components directly in the bottle for autoclaving and add ddH2O plus a magnetic stir bar. Autoclave at 121 °C for 15 min; autoclaving at a higher temperature, for a longer period of time or repeatedly would reduce the quality of the medium.\n3. Plant Infection\nPerform analysis of maize cell division in response to Trojan horse delivered protein (e.g., microscopy-based cell counting) beforehand. U. maydis-induced maize cell proliferation and subsequent tumor formation starts around 4-5 days post infection. Quantitative disease assessments are tissue-dependent and should be performed from 6 to 14 days post infection.\nNOTE: Distinct maize cultivars show different levels of susceptibility to U. maydis infection. Maize cvs. W23, A188, Gaspe flint, Early Golden Bantam or Va35 show susceptibility towards this pathogen and are thus suitable cultivars for Trojan horse studies.\nPreparation of the U. maydis inoculum",
    "Include the progenitor strain SG200 as a negative control in all Trojan horse experiments in order to estimate side effects on the infection by the transgenic strain. Here, use an U. maydis strain expressing a non-secreted version of the protein of interest as a negative control. However, for reasons of practicability (e.g., larger screenings), the progenitor strain may be the easier choice of control.\nBefore starting the experiment, estimate what amounts of infection culture are needed. Keep in mind that infection of each plant requires 1 - 1.5 mL of U. maydis suspension dependent on the maize tissue type.\nNOTE: Approximately 1 mL of an overnight culture is sufficient for dilution to an OD600 of 0.2 in 20 mL of YEPSlight medium, and 25 mL of an U. maydis culture with an OD600 of 0.8-1.0 are sufficient for infection of 13-16 plants.\nScratch U. maydis from a PD agar plate using a sterile Pasteur pipette, inoculate in 5 mL of YEPSlight medium and let the culture grow at 28 °C with constant shaking at 200 rpm for 16 h.\nPrior to infection, examine the U. maydis inoculation culture by standard light microscopy for proper growth and bacterial contamination at 400X magnification.\nNOTE: In a suitable culture, only the cigar-shaped fungus is visible (Figure 2).\nMix 900 µL of fresh YEPSlight with 100 µL of the overnight culture and measure the OD600 using YEPSlight medium as a blank in the spectrophotometer analysis.\nDilute the overnight culture with fresh YEPSlight medium to an OD600 of 0.2 and let the culture grow at 28 °C with constant shaking at 200 rpm until reaching the mid-log growth phase indicated by an OD600 nm of 0.8-1.0.",
    "NOTE: U. maydis cells duplicate every 2 h under these conditions, thus the desired OD600 is reached after 4-5 h of cultivation.\nHarvest the cells at OD600 of 0.8-1.0 by spinning at 3,000 x g for 10 min and discard the supernatant.\nWash the cell pellet one time with ddH2O. For this purpose, add one culture volume of ddH2O, spin with 3000 x g for 10 min and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet carefully in ddH2O using a 20-mL glass pipette, thereby adjusting the final OD600 to 3.0 (for a Trojan horse assay) or 1.0 (for disease rating).\nVerification of the Trojan horse: in planta secretion of the maize fusion protein\nInfect maize seedlings with a Trojan horse strain17.\nPerform microscopic imaging of infected seedlings at 2 - 3 days post infection using a confocal laser-scanning microscope. To this end, excise a rectangular piece of the leaf 1 cm below the point of injection, place the sample onto a microscope slide and add a drop of ddH2O. To visualize mCherry fusion protein, excite specimen at λ= 561 nm and record emission at λ= 580 - 630 nm.\nInfection of adult maize leaves\nCultivate maize plants to the stage of adult leaves (when at least leaf 7 grows within the stalk).\nNOTE: This stage is reached after four weeks upon sowing under greenhouse conditions of 14 h, 28 °C day/10 h, 22 °C night rhythm using cv. W23. Duration may vary with the maize cultivar and greenhouse conditions.\nTransfer the U. maydis culture (see 3.2.9) into a 3-mL syringe with a 20G x 1 hypodermic needle.\nPress the stalk carefully to localize the meristem tissue in the stalk. The base of the meristem can be distinguished by a transition from harder stalk to softer tissue.",
    "Mark the meristem on the stalk using a pen.\nInject 1.5 mL of U. maydis culture 1 cm above the shoot meristem or inflorescence meristem.\nRate disease symptoms at 6 and 12 days post infection.\nInfection of tassels\nGrow maize plants until reaching the tassel stage.\nNOTE: A detailed timeline on anther and tassel development in maize cv. W23 was previously described18,19. Tassels containing pre-meiotic anthers are highly susceptible to U. maydis infection; in the maize cv. W23 tassels are the size of 4 - 7 cm.\nPress the stalk carefully to localize the tassel in the stem.\nMark the tip and the base of the tassel on the stem using a pen.\nTransfer the U. maydis culture (see 3.2.9) into a 3-mL syringe with a 20G x 1 hypodermic needle.\nInject 1.5 mL of the inoculum around the tassel. To ensure equal distribution of the inoculum, slowly place 0.5 mL each at the tip, the middle part, and the base of the tassel marked with the pen.\nRate disease symptoms at 10 days post infection.\nInfection of ears\n\tNOTE: The ear tissue development differs in distinct maize cultivars and greenhouse conditions and must be carefully observed prior to inoculation. Ears starting to outgrow silks are highly susceptible to U. maydis infection.\n\t\nTransfer the U. maydis culture (see 3.2.9) into a 3 mL syringe with a 20 G x 1 hypodermic needle.\nInject the inoculation needle into the space between the husk leaves as deeply as possible without injuring the ear.\nRelease 1.5 mL of the inoculum around the ear.\nRemove the syringe plus needle and carefully massage the cob to distribute the U. maydis solution equally.\nRate disease symptoms at 14 days post infection.\nConfirm viability of U. maydis inoculum",
    "Drop 10 µL of the inoculum on a PD charcoal agar plate and incubate at room temperature for 2 days.\nNOTE: If the respective U. maydis culture is able to form filaments, fluffy, white mycelium becomes visible (Figure 5)\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
