    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThawing hPSCs\nTiming: 60 min\nPlace a 60-mm culture dish on the bench.\nPre-warm StemFit medium at room temperature.\nAdd 5 mL of StemFit medium supplemented with 10 μM of Y-27632 to a 15-mL conical tube.\nRemove the vial containing hPSCs from the liquid nitrogen, and immediately thaw the vial in 37°C water bath within 1 min or until only small ice particles remain.\nDisinfect the vial with 70% EtOH and transfer the cell suspension to the conical tube prepared in step 2 by gentle pipetting (1–2 times).\nCentrifuge the cells at 1,500 rpm for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1 mL of StemFit medium supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632.\nStain the cells with Trypan blue (Gibco, 15250-061) and then count the cells using a cell counter.\nTo reduce human error in cell counting, we recommend the use of an automated cell counter (TC20 automated cell counter; size, 8–16 μm [Bio-Rad]).\nPlate 1 × 104 cells/2 mL StemFit medium supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 to one 60-mm culture dish.\nAdd 8 μL of iMatrix to a 60-mm culture dish with hPSCs.\nCulture the dish at 37°C in 5% CO2 incubator.\nOn the next day, change to 3 mL of fresh StemFit medium without Y-27632 and iMatrix.\nStable culture of hPSCs under feeder-free condition\nTiming: 1–8 weeks\nReplace the culture medium with StemFit without Y-27632 and iMatrix every 24–48 h.\nThe cells should be observed every day.\nStemFit medium is warmed at room temperature.\nUntil next passage, culture medium must be changed every 2 days. However, the medium color should change to orange or yellow even in 1 day, and the culture medium should be changed every day.\nAfter 5–7 days culture, the cells should be passaged.",
    "When the cells become 70%–80% confluent, passage is possible.\nAspirate the culture medium in the 60-mm culture dish and rinse the cells with 3 mL of PBS(-).\nThe amount of PBS(-) required may vary depending on the surface area of the culture apparatus.\nApply and spread 500 μL of 0.5 × TrypLE Select/EDTA, and then aspirate immediately.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C for 5 min.\nThe cell surface does not dry out in approximately 5 min, and thus, cell viability is not a problem. However, if left longer than 5 min, the cells will dry out. Therefore, the cells should be incubated only for 5 min.\nStrip cells by adding 500 μL of StemFit medium containing 10 μM of Y-27632 (See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem 1).\nDissociate cell clumps into single cells by gentle pipetting (approximately 10 times).\nToo much pipetting increases the number of dead cells.\nTransfer the cell suspension using a 1.5-mL microtube.\nDetermine the cell number and viability using any laboratory method. We count living cells by Trypan blue stain using cell counter.\nSeed 1 × 104 cells/2 mL StemFit medium containing 10 μM of Y-27632, and then add 8 μL of iMatrix onto a 60-mm culture dish.\nGently agitate the culture dish to allow the cells to disperse uniformly.\nPlace the culture dish in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C.\nGo back to step 12 for maintenance of the cells.\nCritical: If hPSCs become overly confluent or bind each cell island colony, their pluripotent status and viability may be affected. Observe the cells periodically to ensure that they are undifferentiated and not overly confluent. If any differentiated cells or masses are observed, it is best to discard them and start all over again.\nDifferentiation of hPSCs into limb-bud mesenchyme (LBM)\nTiming: 7 days",
    "This section describes the production of limb-bud mesenchyme (LBM) from hPSCs based on previous reports (Yamada et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). For selective differentiation from hPSCs to LPM, refer to Loh et al. (2016)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]. Our protocol is developed based on previous researches and mimics the limb development process. The procedure of this section consists of 1) culture of hPSCs, 2) mid-primitive streak differentiation, 3) lateral plate mesoderm differentiation, and 4) LBM differentiation. This procedure should be performed on a 35-mm culture dish.\nSeed an hPSC suspension (30,000 cells/1 mL) in a 35-mm culture dish. Cells should be suspended in StemFit medium containing 10 μM Y-27632 and 4 μL of iMatrix.\nCulture for 24 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nChange to 1.5 mL of StemFit medium without 10 μM Y-27632 and iMatrix.\nAfter culture for 48 h, aspirate the culture medium and wash the cells with PBS(-).\nApply 1.5 mL of the first differentiation medium (mid-primitive streak medium) into the 35-mm culture dish.\nAfter culture for 24 h, aspirate the culture medium and wash the cells with PBS(-).\nApply 1.5 mL of the second differentiation medium (lateral plate mesoderm medium) into the 35-mm culture dish.\nAfter culture for 24 h, aspirate the culture medium and wash the cells with PBS(-).\nPBS(-) should be added slowly in consideration of the tendency to peel cells off.\nApply 1.5 mL of the third differentiation medium (LBM medium) into the 35-mm culture dish, and then culture for 48 h (See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem 2).\nThe medium should be added slowly because the cells might peel off.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2098-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Induction of LBM from hPSCs\n(A) Cellular morphology should be observed during stepwise induction procedure.\n(B) PRRX1 staining in LBM.",
    "Critical: During the LBM differentiation procedure, observe the cell morphology at each point under the microscope to validate the cellular differentiation (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). PBS(-) washing procedure prior to medium changes is necessary to achieve high efficiency of LBM induction. The quality of LBM can be assessed by the next FCM procedure instead of PRRX1 immunostaining.\nAssess the quality of LBM\nTiming: 60 min\nWe have identified the cell surface markers that define the human PRRX1+ LBM cells (Yamada et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). This section describes a method enabling the assessment of LBM induction efficiency from hPSCs by checking the cell surface marker expression including CD44, CD140B, and CD49f.\nAfter 48 h from changing to LBM medium, aspirate the culture medium and rinse the cells carefully with PBS(-).\nNote: Cells are easily detached.\nApply 300 μL of Accutase (Nacalai Tesque, 12679-54), and then aspirate immediately.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C for 5 min.\nStrip the cells by adding 300 μL of ExpLBM medium.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 1.5-mL microtube.\nCount the living cells by staining them with Trypan blue and using a cell counter.\nTransfer the 1 × 105 LBM cells into a fresh 1.5-mL microtube, and then centrifuge the cells at 7,000 rpm for 1 min and then suspend the cell pellet with 100 μL of 2% FBS/PBS(-).\nAdd 0.5 μL of each antibody including APC-CD44 (good marker), BB700-CD140B (good marker), and FITC-CD49f (bad marker).\n“Good condition” indicates that CD44 and CD140B are highly expressed with negative CD49f compared with the negative control as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]. On the other hand, “Bad condition” indicates that CD140B is not expressed or less expressed with partially positive CD49f.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2098-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Flow cytometry analysis of LBM cells\nIncubate the cell suspension for 1 h on ice.",
    "Add 500 μL of 2% FBS/PBS(-) to the cell suspension.\nCentrifuge the cells at 7000 rpm for 1 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and suspend the cell pellets with 2% FBS/ PBS(-) containing 50 ng/mL DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, D3571).\nAnalyze the cells by flow cytometry. LBM cells are defined as CD44high CD140Bhigh CD49f (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) (See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem 3–4).\nEstablishment and serial passage of ExpLBM cells\nTiming: 5–7 days\nThis section describes the protocol that enables the stable proliferation of LBM cells (expandable LBM cells, ExpLBM cells) using the specific culture medium named ExpLBM medium. Our LBM expansion protocols which activated WNT and FGF signaling while inhibiting TGFβ signaling, recapitulated the developmental processes for limb-bud outgrowth following chondrogenesis.\nCoat a fresh 60-mm culture dish with 2 mL of 4 μg/mL fibronectin diluted in PBS(-) for at least 30 min at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nAspirate the fibronectin/PBS(-) and then add the ExpLBM medium to the coated dish.\nSeed the 2 × 105 LBM cells suspended in a 3-mL ExpLBM medium onto fibronectin-coated culture dish.\nNext day after plating, check the cell adhesion. If the coating is not in place, the cells will not adhere, and such cells should not be used for further experiments because we have never characterized cells that do not adhere.\nUntil next passage, culture medium should be changed every 2 days.\nAfter 5–7 days culture, if the cells reached 70%–80% cell confluency, the cells should be passaged.\nAssess the quality of ExpLBM cells\nTiming: 60 min\nThis section describes a method that enables the prospective chondrogenic assessment of ExpLBM cells by checking its cell surface marker expression including CD90, CD140B, and CD82.\nAspirate the culture medium and rinse the cells with PBS(-).",
    "Apply 400 μL of Accutase to a 60-mm culture dish, and then aspirate immediately.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C for 5 min.\nStrip the cells by adding 1,000 μL of ExpLBM medium.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 1.5-mL microtube.\nCount the living cells by Trypan blue stain using cell counter.\nTransfer the 1 × 105 ExpLBM cells into a new 1.5-mL microtube, and then centrifuge the cells at 7,000 rpm for 1 min and then suspend the cell pellet in 100 μL of 2% FBS/PBS(-).\nAdd 0.5 μL of each antibody including FITC-CD90 (good marker), BB700-CD140B (good marker), and APC-CD82 (bad marker).\nIncubate the cell suspension for 1 h on ice.\nAdd 500 μL of 2% FBS/PBS(-) to the cell suspension.\nCentrifuge the cells at 7,000 rpm for 1 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and suspend the cell pellets with 2% FBS/ PBS(-) containing 50 ng/mL DAPI.\nAnalyze the cells via flow cytometry. Chondrogenic ExpLBM cells are defined as CD90 high CD140B high CD82 low (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) (See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem 5).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2098-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Flow cytometric analysis of ExpLBM cells\nThis assessment should be performed before 2DCI or 3DCI.\nCritical: It is recommended that ExpLBM cells passaged more than three times be used for the following chondrogenic induction protocols (2DCI or 3DCI).\nCryopreservation of ExpLBM cells\nTiming: 30 min\nResuspend 1 × 106 ExpLBM cell pellets with 300 μL of STEM-CELLBANKER (ZENOGEN PHARMA, CB045).\nDispense 300 μL of cell suspension to cryotubes, and then put them into BICELL (Nihon Freezer, BICELL).\nFreeze cryotubes in BICELL at a −80°C freezer for 24 h, and then transfer them in a −80°C freezer or liquid nitrogen.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2098-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Effect of freeze-thaw on ExpLBM cells\n(A) Flow cytometric analysis of ExpLBM cells.\n(B) Alcian blue staining after the 2DCI-based differentiation.",
    "Critical: It is recommended that ExpLBM cells passaged more than four times be cryopreserved. The ExpLBM cells used in the paper were cryopreserved and used for chondrogenesis assay after freeze-thaw (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nTwo-dimensional chondrogenic induction (2DCI)\nTiming: 15 days\nThis section describes a method to perform the 2-dimensional (adhesive culture) chondrogenic induction protocol of ExpLBM cells. The description below is slightly modified from the original paper by Yamada et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2].\nPrepare the ExpLBM cell suspension (70,000 cells/mL) using an ExpLBM medium containing 10% FBS.\nSeed 200 μL of cell suspension (1.4 × 104 cells) into each well of a 96-well flat culture plate.\nCulture for 3 days.\nWash the cells with PBS(-) and then add the fresh STEP 1 medium.\nCulture for 6 days.\nChange the medium 3 days after changing to STEP 1 medium.\nWash the cells with PBS(-) and then add the fresh STEP 3 medium.\nCulture for 6 days.\nChange the medium 3 days after changing to STEP 3 medium.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2098-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Alcian blue staining after the 2DCI-based differentiation of ExpLBM cells\nAfter 2DCI procedure, the cells are fixed and then stained with Alcian blue. PRRX1 low ExpLBM (Yamada et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) shows lower intensities of Alcian blue staining.\nCritical: PBS(-) washing procedure prior to medium changes is necessary to achieve high efficiency of chondrogenic induction. The chondrocyte differentiation can be assessed using Alcian blue staining (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nThree-dimensional chondrogenic induction (3DCI)\nTiming: >54 days\nThis section describes a method to perform the 3-dimensional (floating culture) chondrogenic induction protocol of ExpLBM cells. The description below is slightly modified from the original paper by Yamada et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2].\nPrepare an ExpLBM cell suspension (5 × 105 cells/mL) using STEP 1 medium.",
    "Seed 200 μL of cell suspension (1 × 105 cells) into each well of a 96-well cell culture plate (CORNING, 7007, clear round bottom, ultralow attachment).\nCentrifuge the plates at 2,000 rpm for 5 min (See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem 6).\nCulture for 6 days.\nChange the medium 3 days after changing to STEP 1 medium.\nReplace the culture media with fresh STEP 2 medium.\nCulture for 6 days.\nChange the medium 3 days after changing to STEP 2 medium.\nReplace the culture media with fresh STEP 3 medium.\nCulture for 42 days (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2098-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Histology of cartilaginous particles generated after 3DCI-based differentiation of ExpLBM cells\nCartilaginous particles were generated from ExpLBM cells, fixed and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE), Alcian blue, Safranin O or Toluidine blue. Immnofluorecence staining; SOX9, COL2, ACAN or COL1.\nChange the medium every 3 days.\n(Option) Replace the culture media with fresh STEP 4 medium, and then culture for several weeks.\nSTEP 4 treatment induces histologically more matured cartilaginous particles."
