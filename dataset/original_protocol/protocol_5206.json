    "Immunofluorescent staining of lung frozen sectionsFrozen lung tissues are prepared by inflating the lungs with optimum cutting temperature (OCT) compound through the trachea, tying off the trachea to maintain the fluid in the lung, and freezing the tissue in a disposable mold containing OCT. Frozen sections shall be cut at 5-10 µm in a cryostat microtome, mounted on Superfrost Plus microscope slides and stored in a -70 °C freezer. For detailed protocol of preparing frozen lung tissues and sections, please refer to Ling et al., 2009.Upon removal of the frozen sections from the freezer, immediately add 50 µl of 4% formaldehyde in PBS to cover the sections.Fix the tissues for 15 min at room temperature.Cover lung sections with PBS for 5 min, then drip off PBS. Repeat 3 times.Permeabilize cells by covering the sections with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min (if staining for proteins that are intracellular). Rinse in PBS 3 times, 5 min each.Incubate in blocking buffer of 5% serum from secondary antibody’s host in PBS pH 7.5 for 30 min to block unspecific binding of the antibodies. Alternative blocking buffers are 1% BSA or 1% FBS in PBS.While blocking, prepare primary antibody at appropriate dilution in blocking buffer. For example, use 1:200 dilution for rabbit anti α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) antibody (Abcam).Incubate lung sections with diluted primary antibodies for 60 min at room temperature (or overnight at 4 °C). Rinse slides 3 times in PBS, 15 min each. Incubate specimen in fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 60 min at room temperature. For example, use 1:1,000 dilution for Texas Red conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Abcam). From this step forward, specimen should be protected from light.Rinse slides three times in PBS, 15 min each.",
    "Coverslip slides with Prolong® Gold anti-fade reagent with or without DAPI (Figure 1). DAPI (4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) is a blue-fluorescent DNA stain that serves as an ideal nuclear counterstain for fixed cells. No additional step is required for DAPI staining.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170514/20170514205701_5124.jpgFigure 1. Mount a coverslip on glass slides with Prolong® Gold anti-fade reagent. A. Before mounting a coverslip; B. After mounting a coverslip.Allow mounting media to cure overnight at room temperature. Observe (and photograph if necessary) an immunofluorescent stained slide by mounting it on the stage of a fluorescence microscope or a confocal microscope.H&E staining of lung sectionsLungs are fixed and embedded in paraffin as described in Baligar et al. (2016). Lung sections shall be cut at 4-5 µm from paraffin embedded lung tissues, and mounted on glass slides.Place slides in glass staining racks. The solutions fill in square glass staining jars. For EasyDip Slide Staining System, each jar holds 80 ml reagent and 12 slides in a staining rack.Deparaffinize the sections by two successive xylene baths, 10 min each.Hydrate the lung sections by passing through decreasing concentration of alcohol baths: 2 changes of absolute alcohol, 5 min each, 95% alcohol for 2 min and 70% alcohol for 2 min.Wash briefly in distilled water.Stain in Mayer’s hematoxylin solution for 8 min.Wash in warm running tap water for 10 min.Rinse in distilled water.Counterstain in 1% eosin Y solution for 30 sec to 1 min.Dehydrate in 95% alcohol and absolute alcohol, 2 changes of 2 min each or until excess eosin is removed. Check under microscope.Clear in xylene, 2 changes of 5 min each.Coverslip slides with resinous mounting medium.Observe (and photograph if necessary) an H&E stained slide by mounting it on the stage of an optical microscope.Masson’s trichrome staining of lung sectionsDeparaffinize and rehydrate lung sections as above.Wash the lung sections in distilled water.",
    "Mordant in preheated Bouin Fluid for one hour at 56-60 °C or overnight at room temperature.Stain in Weigert’s iron hematoxylin solution for 10 min.Wash in running warm tap water for 10 min.Rinse in distilled water.Stain in Biebrich scarlet-acid fuchsin solution for 10-15 min. Rinse in distilled water.Differentiate in phosphomolybdic-phosphotungstic acid solution for 10 to 15 min. Observe the slides frequently with naked eyes. Once collagen-rich areas lose red color and turn to clear proceed to the next step.Transfer slides directly to aniline blue solution and stain for 5 to10 min. Rinse in distilled water and differentiate in 1% acetic acid solution for 2 to 5 min.Wash in distilled water.Dehydrate very quickly through 95% alcohol and then absolute alcohol to wipe off Biebrich scarlet-acid fuchsin staining. Clear in xylene.Mount with resinous mounting medium.Observe (and photograph if necessary) a trichrome-stained slide by mounting it on the stage of an optical microscope."
