  "procedures": [
    "Experimental procedures used in this protocol were approved by the Yale University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, 2017–10557) and were in accordance with all federal policies and guidelines governing the use of vertebrate animals. All animal experiments were carried out on Ambystoma mexicanum (axolotls) in facilities at Yale University.\n1. Diploid Embryo Generation\nObtain GFP+ diploid embryos to serve as graft hosts through natural mating using one or two gfp parents24.\nCollect freshly laid diploid eggs and place them in a metal sieve.\nRinse the eggs thoroughly with 40% Holtfreter's solution (20 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM KCl, 0.8 mM NaHCO3, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 4 mM MgSO4, pH to 7.4).\nPlace the eggs in fresh 40% Holtfreter's solution and store at 12 °C.\n\tNOTE: Diploid embryos should always be obtained before moving on to haploid embryo generation.\n2. Haploid Embryo Generation\nFemale gamete donor preparation\n\t\n48 h before conducting in vitro activation, anesthetize a sexually mature white or white/RFP female axolotl by immersion in 1 g/L HEPES-buffered MS-222 in 40% Holtfreter's solution25.\nEnsure that the animal is fully anesthetized after approximately 30 min of immersion by firmly pinching its tail between the thumb and forefinger. Fully anesthetized animals will not physically respond to any pinch.\nPrepare a solution of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) containing 10,000 U/mL in sterile saline.\nUsing a 30 G insulin syringe, inject 0.15 CC of HCG (1,500 units) into the musculature dorsal to the hind limb of the anesthetized female at 45° angle to the midline to avoid contact with the spinal cord.\nReturn the female to fresh 40% Holtfreter's solution and place in an 8−12 °C refrigerator.\nAfter 48 h, return the female to room temperature. Place a few stones or plastic plants in her container as surfaces for egg laying.",
    "NOTE: Females injected with HCG will often deposit empty jelly cases for several hours before laying eggs.\nRemove the stones or plastic plants after the female has begun consistently laying eggs.\nAllow the female to sit in the empty tank for 30 min to 1 h.\n\t\tNOTE: Withholding materials for the animal to lay eggs on will allow tighter control of oocyte collection.\nMale gamete collection\n\t\nWhile the female's egg laying is stalled, anesthetize a sexually mature GFP+ male axolotl to serve as a sperm donor, as in step 2.1.1.\nPlace the fully anesthetized male on his back on damp paper towels under a dissecting microscope.\nIf the experimenter is righthanded, position the tip of a P1000 pipette at the base of the cloaca with the right hand.\nPlace the left forefinger and thumb of the left hand 2−3 cm rostral to the pelvis. Gently squeeze the animal while moving the fingers towards the hind legs to flush out spermic urine samples.\nCollect each that is flushed out of the cloaca into an individual microcentrifuge tube. Repeat this process to collect 6 to 10 samples.\nPipette 5.0 µL from each sample onto a petri dish to inspect the quality of the sperm using an inverted microscope.\n\t\tNOTE: Concentrated sperm samples are a milky white color, typically range from 5 to 20 µL, and are usually retrieved after several, higher volume spermic urine samples are extracted. Sperm will collect at the bottom of the tubes in higher volume samples when left undisturbed. Concentrated samples of healthy sperm are highly motile and lose activity as their concentration decreases. Healthy males can produce up to 50 µL of concentrated sperm.\nFemale gamete collection\n\t\nAfter obtaining and confirming a healthy sperm sample, anesthetize the HCG-injected female axolotl as in step 2.1.1.",
    "Place the fully anesthetized female on damp paper towels on her back.\nExtract unfertilized eggs from the female using a hand motion similar to that in step 2.2.4.\nCollect the eggs using wet forceps and transfer them to a 10 cm petri dish. Treat eggs with irradiated sperm within 15 min of collection.\nMale gamete preparation and in vitro activation\n\t\nUse a P10 or P20 pipette to pipette the sperm up and down, breaking apart the clumps to form a homogenous suspension.\nApproximate the percentage of motile sperm by placing a 0.5 µL drop of undiluted sperm suspension on a petri dish lid or glass slide and examining with an inverted microscope.\nAdd 9.5 µL of 0.1x Marc's modified Ringer's solution (MMR; Table of Materials) to this sample to make a 20x sperm dilution. Gently pipette up and down to mix.\nWith an inverted microscope, count the sperm in three 1.0 µL drops of the 20x diluted aliquot on a petri dish cover or hemocytometer to estimate the sperm concentration of the undiluted suspension.\nPrepare the sperm for irradiation by diluting an aliquot of the original sperm sample to about 80,000 motile cells/mL in sterile 0.1x MMR.\nCount the number of eggs obtained within the past 15 min. Add 0.5 µL of the freshly diluted sperm from step 2.4.5 per egg to a petri dish. Use the pipette tip to spread this suspension into a 1 mm thick layer.\nUsing a plastic lift, place the sample 4 cm from the bulbs of a 254 nm crosslinker. Genetically inactivate the sperm by irradiating the sample with 800,000 uJ/mm2.\nUsing a P10 pipette, pipette the suspension onto the unfertilized eggs, coating each egg with 0.25−0.5 µL of irradiated sperm. Allow the eggs to sit at room temperature for 30 min.",
    "After 30 min, flood the eggs with 0.1x MMR. Immediately place the eggs in an 8−10 °C incubator for injections the next day or at 18 °C for injections within 7 hours post activation (hpa).\nDejelly haploids using sharp forceps 30 min after hydration. Immediately place the eggs in an 8−10 °C incubator for injections the next day or at 18 °C for injections the same day.\n3. Haploid Mutagenesis and Maintenance\nCRISPR/Cas9 microinjections\n\t\nDesign sgRNAs using CRISPRscan and synthesize26,27.\nFor multiplex mutagenesis, prepare a stock of 5 sgRNAs (10 ng/µL for each sgRNA) and Cas9 protein (1 µg/µL). Prepare a 100-fold dilution of this stock (0.1 ng/µL per sgRNA, 10 ng/µL Cas9) for injection. For single gene, high mutation frequency mutagenesis, follow the protocol outlined previously28.\nInject haploid embryos at the single cell stage 7 hpa if stored at 18 °C or inject embryos the next day at the 2−8 cell stage if they are stored at 8−10 °C.\nTransfer the embryos to 1.0x MMR with 20% polysucrose 400.\nIf single cell, inject each embryo with a 5 nL drop of the injection solution (approximately ¼ radius of the egg) containing a total mass of 0.5 pg/sgRNA and 50 pg Cas9 protein. If multicellular, distribute this mass by injecting smaller volumes into multiple cells.\nAllow the embryos to heal in the polysucrose 400 for a minimum of 4 h and a maximum of 18 h at 18 °C.\nHaploid embryo housing\n\t\nTransfer the embryos to 0.1x MMR with antibiotic-antimycotic.\nHouse each embryo in an individual well of a 24-well plate, as some will die or develop abnormally. Maintain at 16−18 °C. Lower temperatures can be used to prolong development, if necessary.\nReplace the media with fresh 0.1x MMR with antibiotic-antimycotic every other day.\n4. Diploid Host Embryo Preparation",
    "Maintain embryos in the jelly coating at 12 to 16 °C until they reach stage 22 to 26.\nCollect the embryos that are ready for grafting, place them within a sieve (4 mm mesh size), and gently rinse them with 40% Holtfreter's solution.\nTransfer the embryos into filter-sterilized 0.1x MMR containing 1.5% bleach for up to 2 min. Completely submerge the embryos in the bleach solution and swirl them gently to ensure that the jelly coating makes full contact with the bleach solution to kill the microbes present on the embryos.\nAfter 2 min, dilute the bleach solution containing the embryos with an equal volume of filter-sterilized 0.1x MMR.\nGently pour the embryos into a bleach-sanitized sieve (4 mm mesh size) and rinse the embryos five times with filter-sterilized 0.1x MMR.\nPlace the embryos into sterile 10 cm petri dishes with 0.1x MMR with antibiotics for dejellying (penicillin 100 units/mL, streptomycin 100 µg/µL, 0.25 µg/mL, gentamicin 25 µg/mL).\nUnder a fluorescent stereomicroscope, remove the jelly coats and vitelline membranes from GFP+ embryos using sharp forceps (tip dimensions 0.05 x 0.01 mm2).\nTransfer the GFP+ embryos to a new petri dish. Minimize the amount of liquid transferred from the petri dish where they were dejellied.\nRinse the GFP+ host embryos with sterile 0.1x MMR with antibiotics four to six times in order to remove contaminants.\nPlace the clean embryos at 4 °C overnight before grafting.\n\tNOTE: Cooling the embryos makes them more rigid and clean separation of the mesoderm from the endoderm feasible.\n5. Haploid-diploid Chimera Generation\nSurgical dish and media preparation\n\t\nPrepare sterile surgical operating dishes by pouring autoclaved 2% agarose in 0.1x MMR into sterile 35 mm easy-grip petri dishes. Fill the petri dishes halfway with agarose.",
    "After the agarose cools, use a sterile scalpel to cut a 25 mm long, slanted trough in the agarose to hold the embryos in place.\nFill the dish with sterile surgical media (0.1x MMR with anti-mycoplasma 2.5 µg/mL, amphotericin B 0.25 µg/mL, and ciprofloxacin 10.0 µg/mL) and refrigerate at 4 °C.\nEmbryo grafting procedure\n\t\nPlace one healthy haploid donor with one or two stage-matched GFP+ diploid host embryos inside the trough of the prechilled operating dish containing surgical media (Figure 3).\n\t\tNOTE: Perform the procedure on a cooling stage (10 °C or lower) if possible.\nUse two ultra-fine, autoclaved forceps (straight tip, tip dimensions 0.05 x 0.02 mm2) to remove the ectoderm and mesoderm layers from the host with the limb bud near the center (Figure 4).\n\t\tNOTE: The rectangular tissue graft region encompasses the limb bud and extend from the ninth somite to the posterior half of the gill bulge, about 2 mm, along the anterior posterior axis. Along the dorsoventral axis, the grafted region spans approximately 1.5 mm, including the somites to just beyond the ventral edge of the gill bulge. The grafted region includes all lateral plate mesoderm and the lateral halves of the somites, without disturbing underlying endoderm. See Figure 4 and the accompanying video for details.\nSet aside the host tissue and remove an equivalently sized tissue sheet from the haploid donor using the same methods.\nPlace the haploid donor tissue sheet onto the corresponding region of the donor embryo.\nSecure the tissue by covering it with an autoclaved, rectangular glass shard from a crushed microscope cover glass and gently pressing it into the host embryo body.\nFlip the haploid donor embryo onto its other side to harvest the limb bud for the second host embryo. Repeat steps 5.2.2 through 5.2.5.",
    "Carefully remove the remaining excess host tissues and the donor embryo from the dish.\nLeave the grafts with the glass shard anchors in place for 60−75 min, checking every 20 min to ensure that the glass has not slipped off.\nAfter the tissue grafts fully adhere, use the forceps to slowly peel off the glass shard anchors.\nChimera maintenance\n\t\nTransfer the engrafted embryos to fresh surgical media and maintain them at 8−12 °C overnight to heal. Individually house engrafted embryos in 12 or 24-well plates.\nAfter 36−48 h, transfer the engrafted embryos to sterile 0.1x MMR antibiotic-antimycotic. The strong antibiotics in the surgical media cause toxicity in engrafted embryos after 3 days.\nReplace the media with fresh 0.1x MMR and antibiotics every 2−3 days.\nMaintain the engrafted embryos at 18 °C until they are able to feed28.\nAfter 1 to 2 months of development and care, haploid limbs can be scored for purity of the graft using a fluorescent dissection microscope.\n\t\tNOTE: The presence of non-neural or non-blood host-derived GFP-tissue in limbs is an indicator of impure grafting and is often associated with abnormal limb development. These animals should be excluded from further analysis.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
