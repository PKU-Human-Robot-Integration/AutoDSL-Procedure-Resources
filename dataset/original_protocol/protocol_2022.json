    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nHere, we describe the steps for performing a 12 siRNA Library Plate Screen (96 assay plates in total).\nDilute the siRNA library\nTiming: Approximately 2 h, depending on the number of library plates diluted\nThis section describes how to dilute the siRNA library.\nExample Protocol for RNAi transductions:\nDilute the siRNA library in siRNA buffer to a final concentration of 0.4 μM. Mix well, by pipetting up and down multiple times.\nStore at −80°C for long term storage.\nCritical: Avoid freeze/thaw cycles of siRNAs in solution.\nAlternatives: All stock volumes listed are for use of a siRNA library arrayed in the middle 10 columns of twelve 96-well plates. This can be scaled up or down, as long as an appropriate extra dead volume of stock solutions is added for pipetting accuracy.\nPause point: The diluted siRNA library plates can be sealed and frozen, but avoid freeze/thaw cycles, if possible.\nThaw the HeLa cells\nTiming: Approximately 30 min\nThis section describes how to revive and how to bulk-up the cells for the Reverse Transfection.\nFive days before transfection thaw a vial containing 2 million cells and plate them in a 175 cm2 TC-treated flask in 30 mL high glucose DMEM with 10% FBS (or as appropriate for other cell lines). Incubate the flask at 37°C 5% CO2 for two days without medium change.\nThree days before transfection, passage the cells, plating ¼ into each of 4 new 175 cm2 TC-treated flasks. Incubate the flasks at 37°C 5% CO2 for three days without medium change.\nAlternatives: Any cell line of clinical interest can be used as long as the optimal transfection conditions have been predetermined.\nPause point: The cells can be passaged again, as long as there are enough cells on the day of transfection.",
    "Note: It is always best to use the lowest passage number as possible of your cell line.\nNote: There are no more pause points, besides the incubation times, until the plates have been fixed and stained on Day 9 (-IR) and Day 11 (+IR) in step #39.\nCritical: It is crucially important to maintain excellent aseptic tissue culture technique throughout the assay as the automated 96-well format high throughput colony formation assay proceeds for up to 10 days.\nReverse transfect cells\nTiming: Approximately 6 h\nThis section describes the automated liquid handling siRNA Reverse Transfection protocol.\nLibrary/Controls Plate and Transfection Reagent Plate Preparation:\nThaw the siRNA library, if frozen.\nLabel fourteen 96-Well V-bottom plates (Complex formation plates) as siRNA PLATE 1–12, the 13th as MOCK TRANSFECTED, and the 14th as the CONTROL PLATE. Label thirteen 96-Well Flat-bottom TC-treated plates as CELL ASSAY PLATE 1–12 and the 13th as MOCK TRANSFECTED. Label a 96-well deep-well block as the TRANSFECTION REAGENT PLATE.\nCritical: The cells in the MOCK TRANSFECTED plate will be essential for determining the volume of cells re-plated before irradiation.\nDilute the control siRNAs in 1× siRNA buffer, in RNase-free 1.5 mL tubes and then add 150 μL of each to the first and last column of a V-bottom 96-well CONTROL PLATE following the plate map (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1617-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. siRNA library plate layout\nControls are located on the edge columns, 1 and 12. A total of eight non-targeting (NT), one PLK1 siRNA (transfection control), three DNA-PKcs siRNA (DN; positive radiosensitization control), and four un-transfected (UN) wells are found in columns 1 and 12. Library siRNA are located in columns 2 through 11.\n150 μL 0.4 μM PLK1 siRNA.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1617_3.csv\n450 μL 0.4 μM DNA-PKcs siRNA.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1617_4.csv\n1,200 μL 0.4 μM NT siRNA.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1617_5.csv\n600 μL siRNA buffer.",
    "Note: Each of these solutions should be kept at room temperature (18°C–22°C), for the shortest time possible.\nAdd 420 μL Dharmafect1 to 41.58 mL of serum-free medium (minimum requirement is 41.3 mL) in a 50 mL tube and mix well. Using a reagent reservoir and a 1,200 μL multichannel pipette, dispense 430 μL/well into all wells of a deep well 96-well TRANSFECTION REAGENT PLATE (This provides a dead-volume of 40 μL per well as the minimum requirement is 13 × 30 μL = 390 μL). See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nComplex Formation:\nUsing the Janus 96-Tip MDT, with P50 tips loaded, transfer 10 μL of 0.4 μM siRNA from each library plate to one 96-Well V-bottom plates labeled as siRNA PLATE 1–12. These will be the Library siRNA COMPLEX FORMATION PLATES.\nNext, transfer 10 μL of dilution buffer into each well of the MOCK TRANSFECTED plate. While the 13 plates are being processed, store them in a plate stacker, or with lids.\nRemove the middle 10 columns of tips from one box of P50 tips, and using the Janus 96-Tip MDT, transfer 10 μL of control siRNA from the CONTROL PLATE to the siRNA PLATES 1–12 and the MOCK TRANSFECTED plate. These will be the Library siRNA COMPLEX FORMATION PLATES plus Controls.\nAlternatives: Use a manual multichannel pipette to add the controls to all 12 siRNA COMPLEX FORMATION PLATES.\nForm the siRNA complexes:\nUsing a fresh box of P50 tips on the Janus 96-Tip MDT, transfer 30 μL of the diluted Dharmafect1 from the deep well 96-well TRANSFECTION REAGENT PLATE to the MOCK TRANSFECTION plate and mix three times, using a 15 μL volume. Repeat with the 12 siRNA COMPLEX FORMATION plates, using a fresh box of tips for each.\nAllow the complexes to form for 20 min at room temperature.",
    "Critical: Use a fresh box of tips for each siRNA COMPLEX FORMATION PLATE.\nReverse Transfection:\nUsing the PE FlexDrop reagent dispenser, prepare the 13 flat-bottom TC-treated CELL ASSAY PLATES by adding 25 μL of DMEM + 10% FBS (without P/S) to all wells.\nPrepare HeLa cells for plating:\nTrypsinize, resuspend, and count the cells from four 175 cm2 flasks of HeLa cells.\nDilute cells to 80,000 live cells/mL in at least 150 mL of DMEM + 10% FBS P/S-free media in a 500 mL glass bottle.\nNote: Although only 62.4 mL of cell suspension will be dispensed into the assay plates, a large excess is recommended for priming the dispenser tubing, to allow for test plates, and to ensure accurate dispensing by the FlexDrop.\nNote: Trypan blue may be used to disregard any dead cells during cell counting.\nCritical: Lipid-based transfections should be performed in P/S-free media.\nAdd the siRNA complexes, and the cells, to the 96-well TC-treated plates:\nAttach the 500 mL glass bottle containing the diluted HeLa cells to the FlexDrop and prime the dispenser. See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nUsing the Janus MDT, transfer 20 μL of the siRNA complexes to the 12 CELL ASSAY PLATES already containing 25 μL medium.\nDo not add siRNA to the MOCK TRANSFECTION Plate. Move this plate directly to the next to step d. This is a control plate and will be used to calculate the optimized cell number calculation (see below).\nUsing the FlexDrop, dispense 50 μL of cell suspension to each cell plate (4,000 cells/well).\nIncubate each cell plate at room temperature for 20 min to 1 h before placing it in the 37°C 5% CO2 incubator.\nIncubation time:\nIncubate all cell plates for three days at 37°C 5% CO2.",
    "Split each of the transfected cell plates into eight 96-well plates (3 days after transfection)\nTiming: Approximately 6 h for twelve Library plates\nThis section describes the automated liquid handling lifting/splitting protocol for seeding cells into 96-well assay plates for colony formation.\nNote: Prepare a total of 2.5 L of cell culture media.\nPlate Preparation:\nLabel twelve 96-well deep well plates, one per plate of transfected cells, and eight 96-well TC-treated flat bottom plates per plate of transfected cells – four plates (7 Gy or (+) IR) and four plates (0 Gy or (-) IR), for a total of ninety-six 96-well TC-treated Assay Plates.\nWarm 2,500 mL of media and 200 mL trypsin in a water bath set at 37°C.\nUsing the FlexDrop, dispense 176 μL of DMEM + 10% FBS Pen/Strep to forty-eight 96-well TC-treated Assay Plates labeled (-) IR. Store the plates in a plate stacker, or with lids.\nKnock-down Validation:\nVisually inspect Well A1 (PLK1) in all plates. PLK1 is an essential gene in most immortalized cancer cell lines, therefore if no viable cells are observed, KO of the PLK1 gene was successful.\nOptimized Cell Number Calculation:\nManually lift the cells (trypsinize) in the MOCK TRANSFECTED Cell Counting Control Plate containing the NT control-transfected cells as follows.\nUsing an 8-channel aspiration adapter and a manual multichannel pipette, aspirate the media from the cell plate and wash the wells once with 50 μL PBS.\nAdd 50 μL Trypsin per well and return the plate to incubator for 10 min.",
    "Critical: This time will vary for different cell lines. It is important to note that trypsinization of cells in a 96-well plate tends to take longer than for cells in a standard culture flask. It is crucial to confirm by visual inspection under the microscope that all cells have lifted before proceeding to the next step.\nAdd 150 μL of medium to all wells, mix thoroughly and count the cells from several wells.\nCalculate the volume of cells that yields 9,600 cells.\nUsing the FlexDrop, dispense 1,200 μL – minus the volume needed for 9,600 cells – into twelve 96-well deep well plates.\nAutomated Cell Lifting and Splitting procedure for one 96-well plate of transfected cells:\nLift the cells (Trypsinize) each plate of transfected cells using the Janus 96-Tip MDT with a fresh box of P235 tips loaded.\nAspirate the media from the cell plate at 1 mm above well bottom, 0% Liquid Level Tracking, at 10 μL/s.\nAdd 50 μL PBS at 1 mm above well bottom, 0% Liquid Level Tracking, at 10 μL/s.\nAspirate the PBS from the cell plate at 1 mm above well bottom, 0% Liquid Level Tracking, at 10 μL/s.\nCritical: Do not disturb the cell monolayer at this stage.\nAdd 50 μL Trypsin per well and return the plate to incubator for 10 min.\nUsing the Janus MDT, add 150 μL of medium to each well and mix 125 μL three times at 1 mm above well bottom, with 100% Liquid Level Tracking, at 10 μL/s.",
    "To thoroughly re-suspend and de-clump the cells, mix the wells four more times, once in each quadrant of the well (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) with four 125 μL mixes at 20 μL/s, aspirating at 4 mm above the well bottom and dispensing at 1 mm above the well bottom, with 100% Liquid Level Tracking.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1617-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Mixing map showing quadrants of a single well in a 96-well cell plate\nTransfer the appropriate calculated volume for 9,600 cells (step 20) to the deep well plate containing 1,200 μL of media (minus the volume of cells), for a final concentration of 8,000 cells/mL.\nTo thoroughly re-suspend the cells in the deep well plate, mix the wells four times with four 200 μL mixes at 20 μL/s, aspirating at 4 mm above well bottom and dispensing at 1 mm above well bottom, with 100% Liquid Level Tracking.\nTransfer 24 μL (192 cells) from the deep well plate to four 96-well TC-treated Assay Plates which already contain 176 μL medium/well (labeled 0 Gy or (-) IR).\nTransfer 200 μL (1,600 cells) from the deep well plate to four 96-well TC-treated Assay Plates (labeled 7 Gy or (+) IR).\nIncubate each cell plate at room temperature for 1 h before placing it in the incubator (Lundholt et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nRepeat this process from step 22 above, for each plate of transfected cells.\nLeave un-irradiated plates (labeled 0 Gy or (-) IR) in the incubator for the remainder of the experiment.\nIncubate for at least 4 h at 37°C 5% CO2 before irradiating the 7 Gy plates.\nIrradiate half of the plates with 7 Gy\nTiming: Approximately 2 h\nThis section describes how irradiate the assay plates.\nPlace 24 plates in a 2 cm thick tissue-equivalent Plexiglas phantom.",
    "Irradiate with 6 MV photons using a Varian IX linear accelerator at gantry angles 0 and 180 degrees to a total dose of 7 Gy.\nRepeat steps 31 and 32 for the remainder of the 7 Gy plates.\nIncubate the un-irradiated (labeled 0 Gy or (-) IR) plates for a further 6 days and the (labeled 7 Gy or (+) IR) plates for 8 days.\nNote: There are no media changes for the remainder of the experiment.\nCritical: The Plexiglas phantom should always contain 24 plates during irradiation. The number can be made up with plates containing PBS.\nFix, stain, and count colonies\nTiming: Approximately 2 h\nThis section describes fixation and staining the 96-well Assay Plates for the colony formation readout, including instructions on how to use an automated colony counting instrument or high content imaging.\nNote: All washing steps are carried out using a BioTek ELx405 Plate washer. Dispensing of the crystal violet solution is carried out by a Multidrop automated 8-channel dispenser or equivalent.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1617_6.csv\nNote: Store in the dark, at room temperature, tightly capped.\nPrepare Crystal Violet Solution: 5 mg/mL crystal violet in 10% ethanol, 50% Methanol and 40 % water (total volume 500 mL).\nRemove media from 96-well plates (no wash).\nAdd 20 μL Crystal Violet Solution per well and leave at room temperature for 2 min.\nWash off the crystal violet using three cycles of 300 μL of water per well, followed by a final aspiration. Tap plates upside-down to remove any residual liquid and leave the plates to dry.",
    "Count colonies using a GelCount colony counter (Oxford Optronix Ltd, Abingdon, UK), using a 96-well plate mask at 1,200 dpi resolution and CHARM settings appropriate for the cell line used (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] illustrates the CHARM SETTINGS, while Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] illustrates a matching pair of 96-well 0 Gy and 7 Gy plates). See troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1617-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Screenshot of the CHARM settings used for colony counting (image has been enlarged and includes 2 mm scale bar).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1617-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Illustration of a representational pair of 96-well 0 Gy and 7 Gy plates\nAlternative to step 40:\nImage the plates using an IN Cell Analyzer 6000 automated microscope (GE Healthcare), or equivalent, fitted with a Nikon 2× objective (which captures one whole well of a 96-well plate per image), using the Red excitation laser (652 nm), 400 ms exposure time, and the Cy5 emission filter (670–742 nm). Use Laser-based hardware autofocus with an offset from the well bottom of 620 μm to keep the colonies in focus. An example image is shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A. Use a robotic arm and AmbiStore plate stacker (HighRes Biosolutions, Beverly, MA), or equivalent, to automatically load plates into the imager for imaging and unload plates on completion of imaging.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1617-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

    "Analyze the images to generate total colony area per well. For this method we used a custom image analysis protocol (Developer Toolbox (GE Healthcare)). In step 1, the colonies are segmented using an intensity-based threshold (MIN 490 – MAX 65535 Grey levels, images are 16 bit). In step 2, the well is segmented, and in the final step colonies inside the well mask are identified (seen as red) (this enabled removal of out-of-well objects that were segmented such as the well rim and debris). Smaller non-colony cell fragments are removed using area (Area>5,000 μm2, seen in yellow). The total area of remaining colonies in the well is then calculated. The steps of the analysis protocol are shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B. See troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.11]."
