    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTransfer of immune cells to mice\nTiming: 1 h\nTo dissect the molecular and cellular mechanisms of demyelination induced by HSV1-IL-2, we infected HSV-IL-2 to various genetically engineered mice, or mice with adoptively transferred cells. We found that both type 2 innate lymphocytes (ILC2s) and T cells play a role in induction of demyelination, because mice lacking these cells did not develop demyelination following infection with HSV1-IL-2, whereas transfer of ILC2s isolated from wild-type mice into recipient ILC2-deficient mice (Hirose et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) or T cells isolated from wild-type mice into SCID mice (Zandian et al., 2011a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]) infected with HSV1-IL-2 restored the demyelination phenotype. In this section, we describe the method for intravenous injection of immune cells to test their function in this mouse model. After the transfer of the ILC2s or T cells, we waited two weeks for cells to settle down before infecting the mice with HSV-IL-2 virus. Female mice aged 7–9 weeks were used.\nIsolate ILC2 cells as described previously (Hirose et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Moro et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]) and transfer into a 1.5 mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 10 min, 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant with a p1000 pipetman.\nResuspend the cells with MEM to a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/mL.\nPlace a heat lamp above the mouse cage to help dilate the tail veins.\nGently place the animal in a restraining device and stabilize the tail between the thumb and forefinger.\nAttach a 26G × 1/2 inch needle to a 1 mL syringe and fill the syringe with 0.1 mL of cell suspension.\nCritical: Remove bubbles by tapping the syringe. Injected bubbles clog blood vessels and can cause the death of the mouse.\nWipe the tail with 70% isopropyl alcohol.",
    "Start the injection at the middle or slightly distal part of the tail. With the tail under tension, insert the needle, approximately parallel to the vein, and with the bevel (angled surface of the needle) upward, and keep pushing the needle in until it is 3 mm into the vein.\nInject 0.1 mL of cell suspension slowly. The fluid should inject freely without resistance.\nWait for two weeks so that the cells settle down in the recipients.\nOptional: Intraperitoneal (IP) injecting cells is an option if you know that the injected cells can move to the brain.\nOcular infection with HSV-IL-2\nTiming: 2 min/mouse\nIn this section, we describe a method for ocular infection with HSV-1. The recombinant HSV-IL-2 is used to induce demyelination, and its parental virus dLAT2903 was used as a negative control. Both viruses are derived from the highly virulent HSV-1 strain McKrae, and therefore ocular scarification is not required (Ghiasi et al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nCritical: This procedure must be done in a biosafety cabinet, and the infected mice must be housed in a separate space from uninfected mice as described in the animal protocol approved by IACUC.\nThaw virus stock on ice. Gently mix with pipetting.\nDilute the virus stock to 1 × 105 PFU/μL with RS medium.\nHold a mouse with the left hand and drop 2 μL of virus stock into each eye with a 10 μL tip attached to a P10 pipetman (Gilson) or similar device.\nReturn the mouse to the cage.\nCritical: Do not reuse the virus stock. The titer goes down significantly after refreezing.\nIsolation of organs for cryosectioning and luxol fast blue (LFB) staining\nTiming: 4 days",
    "The presence or absence of demyelination in the optic nerve (ON), spinal cord (SC), and brains of infected mice will be evaluated using luxol fast blue (LFB) staining of cryosections of these tissues as we described previously (Mott et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]; Osorio et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]; Zandian et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]; Zandian et al., 2011a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]; Zandian et al., 2011b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]). LFB is used to visualize myelin in nerve tissue through blue staining. Myelin will be stained blue, and neurons will be stained violet. In this section, we describe the method of cryosectioning and LFB staining.\nIsolate optic nerve (ON), spinal cord (SC) and brain from surviving mice on day 14 post infection. We have detected both focal and diffuse regions of demyelination in the HSV-IL-2 infected mice as early as day 10 post infection and as late as 60 days post infection (the final experimental time point) in all strains of mice tested (Zandian et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]). See also Methods videos S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] and S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2].\nEuthanize infected mice with an IACUC approved method.\nCritical: Euthanize one mouse at a time. We experienced that postmortem rigidity starts around 10 min after euthanasia and, once it happens, the spinal cord cannot be extruded from the spinal column with a syringe.\nWet mouse fur by spraying with 70% ethanol.\nUsing a pair of scissors, make a small cut along the back of the mouse.\nGrasp the skin along both sides of the cut with tweezers and pull in a cranial and caudal directions to tear the skin and expose the spine.\nCut remaining skin with a pair of scissors along the dorsal midline to tip of the nose. Then peel skin to right and left in order to clear the dorsal aspect of the head (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/416-Fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2. Isolation of brain and optic nerve for cryosectioning\n(A) Cut skin and peel back to expose the underlying tissue.\n(B) Use scissors to cut off the top of the skull and expose the brain.\n(C) Gently peel back the brain to reveal the X-shaped optic nerves (green arrow). Disconnect brain from optic nerves (red lines).\n(D) Optic nerves are exposed (green arrow) after brain removal. Cut along red lines to isolate them.\n(E) Place the optic nerve in mold and fill the mold with OCT compound.\nUsing scissors, cut the skull to expose the brain (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nInsert a pair of angled tweezers between the olfactory bulb and cerebral cortex (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C) and gently lift the cerebrum without cutting the optic nerve. The optic nerves should be visible as X-shaped white fibers (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C, D, green arrow).\nCut the rostral ends of the optic nerve in order to dissociate from brain.\nRemove the brain and wash it with PBS (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nCut the caudal ends of optic nerves, and pick it up with a pair of tweezers or a small needle.\nIsolate the spinal cord as described by Richner and colleagues (Richner et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]), except instead of using a pipette tip, use a 20G needle attached to a 10 mL syringe.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1.

    "Place each tissue in a 10 mm × 10 mm × 5 mm mold (ON) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E) or 15 mm × 15 mm × 5 mm mold (SC or brain), then embed the tissues in OCT compound. For brain, place an embedding ring after the brain is placed in the mold but before adding the OCT compound, in order to secure the tissue block on the microtome chuck adaptor.\nQuickly freeze on dry ice. Store at −80°C.\nPause Point: Store frozen blocks at −80°C before proceeding. The blocks can be stored for years if the temperature is stable. At the chamber temperature of −18°C, tissues in the block will be damaged over time. Although others recommend using a sample block just once and discarding it after sectioning, we did not have any problems reusing the blocks that had been at −18°C for a few hours as long as they were stored at −80°C immediately after sectioning. We also did not have any problems using these sample blocks for isolating RNA.\nPrepare cryosections.\nLeave the frozen block inside the cryostat microtome chamber for 15 to 30 min to bring the temperature of the block up to that of the chamber.\nSet the block on the microtome chuck adaptor with OCT compound and adjust the angle of the block.\nCut the frozen block with the cryotome in a transverse plane at 9 μm thickness and transfer the slices to glass slides.\nCritical: Obtaining good quality sections is the key to identifying genuine plaques of demyelination. Besides practicing, there are several points to keep in mind. See Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nAir dry sections on the slide at 22°C–25°C for 12–16 h.\nImmerse the slide in acetone for 3 min, then air dry in a chemical hood.",
    "Critical: Acetone is toxic and highly volatile. Work in a chemical hood. Follow the national and institutional guidelines for use and disposal.\nStore in slide boxes at −20°C.\nPause Point: Store slides at −20°C or −80°C before staining. In our experience, sections can be stored for at least a few months.\nStand slides in a slide holder and allow to thaw 22°C–25°C for 10–20 min before transferring to LFB solution 22°C–25°C.\nStain slides in LFB solution in a 56°C water bath 12–16 h.\nNote: To avoid evaporation of LFB solution, we use parafilm to seal the container.\nRemove surplus staining solution by transferring the slide to a 95% ethanol solution for 1–5 min.\nWash the slides in distilled water.\nWash out extra LFB staining from the slides in 0.05% lithium carbonate solution for 1–30 s.\nWash the slides in 70% ethanol for 1–30 s to remove excess LFB staining.\nKeep the slides in distilled water. Check the slides under a microscope.\nNote: Wash out residual 70% ethanol from the slides by moving the slide holder up and down in distilled water.\nOptional: If the background staining is high, repeat the washing steps 7 and 8 (above).\nPause Point: Slides can be stored up to 20 min or so until next step is ready.\nStain the slides in cresyl violet solution for 5–10 min.\nWash out excess cresyl violet solution from the slides using distilled water. See Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]\nPause Point: Slides can be stored for up to 20 min or so until next step is ready.\nWash out extra cresyl violet staining from the slides in 95% ethanol for 5–20 min (check with a microscope).\nDehydrate slides in 100% alcohol for 5 min, twice.\nDehydrate slides in xylene for 5 min, twice. Air dry.",
    "Critical: Xylene is toxic and highly volatile. Work in a chemical hood. Follow the national and institutional guidelines for use and disposal.\nDrop mounting medium on the slide and apply a cover glass.\nPause Point: Slides can be stored at 22°C–25°C. In our experience, stained sections can be stored for at least one year when protected from light.\nObserve slides by bright-field imaging with a 20× objective lens (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/416-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Demyelination in HSV-IL-2-infected mouse on day 14 post infection\nMice were infected ocularly with 2X105 pfu/eye of HSV-IL-2 virus. Typical demyelinating lesions detected by LFB staining are shown. The arrows indicate areas of demyelination (i.e., a plaque) in brain, SC, and ON of infected mice. A 10× objective lens was used. Scale bar, 300 μm.\nRNA purification from brain samples\nTiming: 2 days\nIn this section, we describe the method to isolate RNA from frozen blocks of brain made for cryosectioning. The quality and quantity of the isolated RNA is sufficient for reverse transcription and subsequent qPCR. This protocol was modified from the RNeasy mini kit for samples containing OCT compound. Please review the manual for RNeasy kit before starting RNA preparation. This protocol may be applicable to other tissues stored as frozen blocks, although further optimization might be necessary.\nCut frozen sections to a thickness of 9 μm and brush them into a pre-chilled 2 mL tube.\nNote: Bring a small box filled with dry ice into the chamber. Keep tubes on dry ice during and after collecting sections. Sections are thin and thaw quickly, which can result in RNA degradation.",
    "Note: Sections do not need to remain flat and may form rolls. 20 to 40 rolled sections will fit into a 2 mL tube. The amount of tissue that can be used will be limited by the capacity of Trizol and the RNA purification column.\nAlternatives: Other commercial reagents of the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method could be used in a similar way as Trizol with optimization.\nAdd 0.5 mL of Trizol per tube containing 20 to 40 sections and vortex immediately to minimize section clumping.\nCritical: Trizol and chloroform are volatile and toxic. They must be used under chemical hood.\nLeave tubes on ice for a few minutes, then vortex again.\nOptional: All OCT compound should dissolve into Trizol. It may be necessary to add more Trizol to completely dissolve the sample. If the volume of Trizol is increased, also increase the volume of chloroform and 70% ethanol accordingly.\nPause Point: In our experience, samples can be stored for at least one month at −80°C.\nThaw samples on ice.\nNote: Keep samples on ice until homogenization is complete (step 38).\nAdd 1 bead (5 mm diameter) per tube using a bead dispenser.\nAlternatives: We homogenize tissues using beads and a bead homogenizer, TissueLyser LT. Other commercial bead homogenizers or rotor-stator homogenizers can also be used. Optimization is needed for homogenizing samples completely.\nCool the bead homogenizer tube adaptor on dry ice for a few seconds.\nSet sample tubes in the bead beater. Set oscillations to 50 Hz for 2 min.\nAfter oscillation, check for the presence of large tissue fragments. If present, oscillate for another 2 min.\nLeave tubes at 22°C–25°C for 5 min (prepare 70% ethanol, spin columns, tubes).\nAdd 100 μL of chloroform to the tube and mix well.",
    "Leave the tubes at 22°C–25°C for 2 min. (Aqueous and non-aqueous phases will separate out.)\nPause Point: Store at −80°C at this step or one step before.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the upper phase (0.25 mL) to a new 1.5 mL tube.\nNote: Do not take the middle debris layer made of proteins including RNase A, which easily refolds and becomes active in the absence of a denaturing reagent.\nAdd an equal volume (0.25 mL) of 70% ethanol and mix well.\nTransfer up to 0.7 mL of the mixed solution into a RNeasy Mini spin column.\nAlternatives: Other RNA purification columns can be used. For optimization, see the manual attached to the kit.\nCentrifuge at 8,000 × g for 15 s, and discard flow-through.\nNote: If you increased the volume of Trizol at the homogenization step, repeat loading and centrifuging of sample until all the sample has been processed through the column.\nAdd 0.35 mL of Buffer RW1 to the column.\nCentrifuge at 8,000 × g for 15 s and discard flow-through.\nPrepare DNase I master mix by adding 10 μL of Qiagen DNase I with 70 μL of Buffer RDD per sample.\nMix gently, as DNase I is sensitive to physical denaturation.\nAdd 80 μL of the DNase I solution to the columns.\nLeave the columns at 22°C–25°C for 30 min.\nAdd 0.35 mL of Buffer RW1 to the column.\nLeave the columns at 22°C–25°C for 5 min.\nCentrifuge at 8,000 × g for 15 s, and discard flow-through.\nAdd 0.5 mL of Buffer RPE to the column.\nCentrifuge at 8,000 × g for 15 s, and discard flow-through.\nAdd 0.5 mL of Buffer RPE to the column.\nCentrifuge at 8,000 × g for 15 s, and discard flow-through.",
    "Place the column in a new collection tube.\nCentrifuge at maximum speed for 2 min to remove the residual liquid from the column.\nPlace the column in a new 1.5 mL collection tube.\nApply 30 μL of nuclease-free water directly onto the membrane with a pipette.\nIncubate at 22°C–25°C for 1 min.\nSpin for 1 min at maximum speed to elute the RNA.\nMeasure the RNA concentration.\nNote: Typically, we use 0.5 μg of RNA for reverse transcription. cDNA derived from 10 ng RNA is sufficient for a qPCR assay. See Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nPause Point: Purified RNA can be stored in −80°C. In our experience, RNA can be stored for at least one month."
