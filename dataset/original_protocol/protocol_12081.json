The STOP solution should be prepared immediately prior to use.\nPrepare the basement membrane matrix (e.g., matrigel, referred to as MAT hereon) mixture solution.",
    "NOTE: All steps preparing and using the MAT mixture should be performed on ice or at 4 °C. Thaw frozen MAT in ice at 4 °C overnight. Dilute MAT 1:1 by adding 10 mL ice-cold IMDM and chill in ice at 4 °C overnight. Dilute MAT mixture with an additional 20 mL ice-cold IMDM and chill in ice at 4 °C overnight. Aliquot into pre-chilled tubes and store at -20 °C until use. When ready for use, thaw MAT mixture overnight at 4 °C.\n\t\t\nCoat the MAT cell culture plates.\n\t\t\tNOTE: All steps of coating MAT plates should be performed on ice. Pre-chill 6-well and 24-well plates at -20 °C for at least 1 h. When ready to coat plates, place them on ice. Coat each well with 4x-diluted MAT, removing and re-using any excess solution. Leave on ice for 30 - 60 min, and aspirate excess MAT. Dry the MAT coated plates in a 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator for a minimum of 3 h. Use within 72 h of coating.\nPrepare the solution of 10% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) by dissolving 10% w/v BSA in ice-cold, distilled, deionized water at 4 °C for 3 - 4 h.

If using the 100 mL MeC, upon arrival, divide into 2.5 mL aliquots in 14 mL conical tubes.\n\t\tNOTE: All aliquots should be stored at -20 °C. MeC medium aliquots should be thawed immediately prior to use.\n2. Mesoderm Differentiation of hPSCs\nGrow the hPSC cell lines on MEFs to 70 - 80% confluency, in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2.\n\tNOTE: The hPSCs should have sharp, undifferentiated borders.\nPrepare MAT-coated plasticware 24 h before passaging the hPSCs.",
    "NOTE: The total number of MAT-coated 6-well dishes varies across hPSC lines. Normally, three 6-well dishes are sufficient per 6-well dish of confluent hPSCs on MEFs.\n\t\nPerform a trial feeder-depletion with different ratios of confluent hPSCs:MAT wells (1:4, 1:3, 1:2, etc.) before the first differentiation to determine how many MAT-coated 6-well dishes should be used for subsequent differentiations.\n\t\tNOTE: 24 h after plating onto MAT, the hPSCs should be 80 - 90% confluent, with cell clumps of approximately 10 - 20 cells in size.\nAspirate the hPSC media and add 1 mL 37 °C 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA to each well for 1 min. Aspirate and add 1 mL STOP media to each well. Using a cell scraper, scrape the cells off the plate. Add 1 mL WASH buffer to each well.\nWith a 2 mL serological pipet, triturate 3 - 5 times to break up large clumps of cells and transfer the cells to a 50 mL conical tube. Centrifuge the hPSCs at 330 x g for 5 min.\nResuspend the cells in a total volume of hPSC media equivalent to 2 mL per well of the MAT-coated plasticware to be used. Add 2 mL/well of hPSCs to the plasticware and incubate overnight in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2.\n24 h later, aspirate the media and replace with 37 °C 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA for 1 min. Aspirate the Trypsin-EDTA and add 1 mL STOP media. Scrape the cells vigorously with a cell scraper. Add 1 mL WASH media to each well. With a 2 mL serological pipet, triturate the cells 1 - 2 times and transfer to a 50 mL conical tube. Centrifuge cells at 220 x g for 5 min.",
    "NOTE: The length of time of Trypsin-EDTA treatment should be determined by the investigator for each hPSC line. The Trypsin treatment should be applied for as long as possible without causing single-cell dissociation. This step should detach all the hPSCs from the MAT-coated plates, but not result in single-cell dissociation. Resultant EBs should be 6 - 10 cells, on average.\nAspirate the media. Using a 5 mL serological pipet, gently resuspend the cells in 20 mL WASH media. Centrifuge at 220 x g for 5 min.\nGently resuspend the EBs in Day 0 media (Table 1). Dispense 2 mL of differentiation media containing EBs into each well of a 6-well low-adherent cell culture dish using a 10 mL serological pipet. Place into a 37 °C 5% CO2 5% O2 (multi-gas) incubator.\n\tNOTE: Day 0 media: SFD media supplemented with 10 ng/mL BMP4 (Table 1). For every two plates of hPSCs, use one 6-well low-adherent cell culture dish.\n24 h later, add 2 mL Day 1 media (Table 1). Incubate the cells overnight in a multi-gas incubator.\n\tNOTE: Day 1 media: SFD media supplemented with 10 ng/mL BMP4 and 10 ng/mL bFGF to each well (Table 1).\n18 h later, gently harvest the EBs with a 5 mL serological pipet and spin at 100 x g for 5 min. Wash and combine the entire culture with 10 mL IMDM. Spin at 100 x g for 5 min. Aspirate the media.\n\tNOTE: Debris will exist in the cultures. This centrifugation step at a low speed (100 x g) will remove the debris.\nGently resuspend the EBs in SFD media supplemented with Day 2 media (Table 1), and then dispense 2 mL per well into 6-well low-adherent cell culture plates. Incubate in a 37 °C multi-gas incubator for 30 h.",
    "NOTE: Day 2 media: 10 ng/mL BMP4, and 5 ng/mL bFGF, and the appropriate WNT agonist or antagonist (Table 1).\n\t\nAdd 3 µM CHIR99021 to specify definitive hematopoietic progenitors. Alternatively, add 3 µM IWP2 and 1 ng/mL Activin A to specify primitive hematopoietic progenitors.\nContinue to Section 3 for hematopoietic progenitor specification.\n3. Specification of CD34+ Hematopoietic Progenitors\nAfter 30 h, isolate the EBs with a 2 mL serological pipet at Day 3 of differentiation. Transfer to a 50 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 330 x g for 5 min. Gently resuspend and wash with 10 mL of IMDM. Centrifuge the cells again at 330 x g for 5 min.\nResuspend the EBs in Day 3 media (Table 2) and dispense 2 mL into each well of low-adherent 6-well plates. Incubate cells in a 37 °C multi-gas incubator for 72 h.\n\tNOTE: Day 3 media: SP34, supplemented with 15 ng/mL VEGF and 5 ng/mL bFGF (Table 2). Add more media per well if the pH of the media harvested on Day 3 of differentiation has significantly changed (i.e., yellow-orange media). Alternatively, use fewer EBs per well on Day 0.\nAfter 72 h of incubation, add 2 mL of Day 6 media (Table 2) to each well. Incubate in a 37 °C multi-gas incubator for an additional 48 h.\n\tNOTE: Day 6 media: SP34 media supplemented with 15 ng/mL VEGF, 5 ng/mL bFGF, 200 ng/mL SCF, 4 IU EPO, 20 ng/mL IL-6, 10 ng/mL IL-11, and 50 ng/mL IGF-1 (Table 2). If more media was added in step 3.1, then add the equivalent amount of media in step 3.2 so that the final cytokine concentrations remain the same.\nIsolate the CHIR99021-treated EBs on Day 8 of differentiation. Proceed to Section 4.",
    "IWP2-treated EBs are harvested on Day 8 of differentiation into a 50 mL conical tube. Centrifuge at 330 x g for 5 min. Gently resuspend in Day 8 media (Table 2). Incubate for 24 h in a 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator in low adherent dishes.

Aspirate off the supernatant.\nResuspend the EBs in 5 mL of Collagenase II. Vortex for 5 s and incubate in a 37 °C water bath. After 60 min, vortex for 5 s and add 5 mL of STOP solution. Spin at 330 x g for 5 min. Aspirate off the supernatant.\nIn 1 mL of FACS buffer, resuspend the cells. Pass the cells through a 40 µm cell strainer. This removes any undissociated cell clumps.\nCount the cells. Aliquot 1 x 106 cells into a 14 mL conical tube. Spin the cells at 330 x g for 5 min. Resuspend the cells at a concentration of 5 x 106 cells/mL in FACS buffer. Aliquot and pool 10% of the cells in each condition for flow cytometric color controls. Incubate the cells in antibodies for 30 min on ice, in the dark.",
    "NOTE: See suggested fluorophore combinations in Table of Materials.\n\t\nFor IWP2-treated cells, use anti-CD34 and anti-CD43 antibodies.\nFor CHIR99021-treated cells, use anti-CD34, anti-CD43, anti-CD73, and anti-CD184 antibodies.\nRinse the cells twice using FACS buffer. Spin at 330 x g for 5 min. Resuspend the cells at a final concentration of 5 x 106 cells/mL.\nAnalyze or isolate cells by flow cytometry. For primitive hematopoietic progenitors, analyze the CD34 and CD43 expression (Figure 2A). For definitive hematopoietic progenitors, isolate the HE (CD34+CD43−CD73−CD184−) by FACS (Figure 2B). Collect the cells in tubes containing chilled FACS buffer.\nTo assess the definitive hematopoietic potential from isolated HE, continue to either Section 5 for the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition, or Section 7 for T-lymphoid assay. For primitive hematopoietic CFC assays, continue to Section 6.\n5. Endothelial-to-hematopoietic Transition\nSpin the isolated CD34+CD43−CD73−CD184− cells at 330 x g for 5 min. Resuspend cells in HE media at 200,000 cells/mL (Table 2). Distribute the cells in 50 µL aliquots in a 96-well low-adherent cell culture plate. Incubate the cells overnight in a 37 °C 5% CO2 5% O2 multi-gas incubator.\n\tNOTE: HE media: SP34 media supplemented with 5 ng/mL VEGF, 5 ng/mL bFGF, 100 ng/mL SCF, 2 IU EPO, 10 ng/mL IL-6, 5 ng/mL IL-11, 25 ng/mL IGF-1, 30 ng/mL TPO, 10 ng/mL FLT3-L, 30 ng/mL IL-3, 10 ng/mL BMP4, 20 ng/mL SHH, 10 µg/mL Angiotensin II, and 100 µM Losartan potassium at 2 x 105 cells/mL (Table 2).\nPrepare the 24-well MAT-coated plates (see step 1.2.7.1), as needed.",
    "The cells will aggregate into clumps of 6 - 10 cells overnight. For each 50 µL volume of reaggregated cells, gently transfer the cells into the center of a 24-well MAT-coated plate on the next morning. Gently place plate in 37 °C multi-gas incubator for 4 - 6 h, until the cells are attached.\nAdd 1 mL of fresh HE media to each well, after the cells are attached. Incubate the cells in a 37 °C 5% CO2 5% O2 multi-gas incubator until the hematopoietic cells are visible (typically 5-7 days; Figure 2D). Visualize under 100X magnification using a light microscope.\nHarvest the definitive hematopoietic progenitors by gently removing the HE media from cells. Pass this media through a 40 µm cell strainer and collect. To the adherent cells in the well, add 0.5 mL 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA to cells and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min. Add 0.5 mL STOP solution to each well. Pass through cells through the same 40 µm cell strainer to pool all adherent and non-adherent cells together. Spin at 330 x g for 5 min.\nTo assess the CFC potential of this bulk culture, proceed to Section 6.\nWash the cells twice in FACS buffer. Spin at 330 x g for 5 min.\nResuspend the cells in FACS buffer at 5 x 106 cells/mL. Stain the cells with anti-CD45 and anti-CD34 antibodies for 30 min on ice in the dark (suggested fluorophores are in the Table of Materials).\nWash the cells twice in FACS buffer. Spin at 330 x g for 5 min.\nIsolate the CD34+CD45+ cells by FACS (Figure 2E). Sort the cells into chilled FACS buffer.\nAssess the definitive CD34+CD45+ hematopoietic progenitors as needed (CFC assay in Section 6, lymphoid potential in Section 7, or another investigator-initiated assay).\n6. CFC Assay",
    "Thaw aliquots of MeC for each sample used for the CFC assay.\nAdd the cells to be assayed (steps 4.5, 4.7, 5.5, or 5.9) in MeC. Vortex thoroughly and let the MeC cultures stand for 5 - 10 min until air bubbles dissipate, as per the manufacturer's instructions. Using a 16 ½ gauge needle on a 3 mL syringe, carefully remove 2 mL of the MeC.\n\tNOTE: Typical plating densities range from 1,000 - 20,000 cells/mL, depending on the anticipated progenitor frequency.\nCarefully, dispense 1 mL MeC cell mixture in each of two 35 mm tissue culture dishes. Evenly distribute the MeC in the 35 mm dishes by gently tapping and rotating the dish. Place each of the above dishes into a 15 cm tissue culture dish filled with water. Incubate in a 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator.\nVisualize the MeC cultures using a light microscope using 40X magnification. Quantify the various CFCs obtained. Analyze the Primitive CFC assays 8 - 10 days after plating (Figure 2C). Analyze the Definitive CFC assays 14 days after plating. Representative CFC assay colony morphologies can be seen in Figure 2F.\n7. T Cell Assay to Establish Definitive Hematopoietic Potential\nGrow the OP9-DL4 cells until confluent in a 100 mm tissue culture dish30,31,32.\nThaw the OP9-DL4 cells 72 - 96 h prior to plating the T cell assays. Resuspend the OP9-DL4 cells in 10 mL OP9 media and dispense into a 10 cm plate. Grow in a 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator until 70 - 90% confluent.",
    "To harvest the OP9-DL4 cells from a 100 mm dish, remove the media and add 5 mL 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA for 5 min. Stop the trypsin activity with 5 mL OP9 media. Spin the cells at 330 x g for 5 min. Resuspend the cells in 1 mL OP9 media and count the cells.\n\t\tNOTE: One 10 cm plate of confluent OP9-DL4 cells will yield approximately 10 x 106 OP9-DL4 cells.\n48 h prior to the T cell assay, plate 2 x 106 cells in 12 mL OP9 media in a 24-well dish (0.5 mL/well). Grow in a 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator.\nAdd 2,000 - 10,000 cells to be assayed (as obtained in steps 4.5, 4.7, 5.5, or 5.9) to 1 well of OP9-DL4 cells in OP9 media supplemented with: 30 ng/mL SCF (first 6 days only), 5 ng/mL IL-7, and 5 ng/mL FLT3-L. Incubate in a 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator. No media changes occur at this step.\nEvery 4 - 5 days, passage the T cell progenitors onto fresh OP9-DL4 stromal cells in a 6-well dish. Triturate the cells with a 1 mL pipet and pass through a 40 µm filter to remove clumps. Spin at 330 x g for 5 min. Aspirate off the media. Resuspend the cells in 2 mL of fresh OP9 media supplemented with 5 ng/mL IL-7 and 5 ng/mL Flt3-L, and place on fresh OP9-DL4 cells.\n\tNOTE: 48 h prior to passaging, plate 2 x 106 fresh OP9-DL4 cells in 12 mL OP9 media, and distribute 2 mL/well into 6-well dishes.\nAfter at least 21 days of co-culture, triturate the cells vigorously and pass through a 40 µm filter to remove cell debris. Spin at 330 x g for 5 min and aspirate the supernatant.",
    "Wash the cells twice in cold FACS buffer. Spin at 330 x g for 5 min.\nResuspend the cells in FACS buffer at 5 x 106 cells/mL. Stain cells with anti-CD45, anti-CD56, anti-CD4, and anti-CD8 antibodies for 30 min on ice in the dark (suggested fluorophore combinations are in Table of Materials). Apply a live/dead cell stain (DAPI, etc.) to remove debris from the analysis.\nWash the cells twice in FACS buffer. Spin at 330 x g for 5 min.\nAnalyze the cells using a flow cytometer to assess the presence of T-lymphocyte progenitors (Figure 3).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
