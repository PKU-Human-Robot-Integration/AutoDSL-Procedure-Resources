    "The study was approved by the ethical committee of Pisa University, and informed and signed consent was obtained from each donor.\n1. Formation of γH2AX and 53BP1 foci\nPreparation of samples and mutagenic treatment\n\t\nCollect whole blood samples by venipuncture from healthy adult individuals in blood collection (e.g., Vacutainer) tubes containing lithium heparin as an anticoagulant.\nIn order to guarantee proper blood sample preservation, start the procedure within 24 h of sampling.\nAdd 300 µL of the sample to a tube containing 4.7 mL of complete medium (0.5% penicillin-streptomycin, 0.75% phytohemagglutinin, 10% FBS previously inactivated, 88.75% RPMI 1640).\nThen add bleomycin sulfate to a final concentration of 5 µg/mL.\n\t\tCAUTION: Bleomycin sulfate is a mutagen. Avoid skin contact and inhalation. Prepare the solution and add the sample under a hood.\nFor each sample, set up a negative control (absence of mutagen).\nPlace the tube in a thermostat at 37 °C for 2 h.\nFixation\n\t\nCentrifuge samples at 540 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with vortex.\nAdd 5 mL of hypotonic solution (2.87 g of KCl dissolved in 500 mL of deionized water) and 400 µL of pre-fixative solution (5:3 acetic acid: methanol) to cause hemolysis of red blood cells.\nCentrifuge samples at 540 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 5 mL of methanol at room temperature for at least 30 min to fix the cells.\nAlternatively, store the cells at -20 °C until use.\nSlides preparation\n\t\nCentrifuge samples at 540 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 5 mL of a 3:1 methanol: acetic acid solution. Repeat these steps one more time.",
    "At the end, centrifuge the solution again at 540 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nAspirate the supernatant again leaving enough solution (0.5 mL) to resuspend the pellet, pipette vigorously, drop the resuspended cell pellet on the slides, and air dry. Store the slides at 4 °C.\nImmunofluorescence\n\tNOTE: Immunofluorescence is an immunologic method for identifying specific cell targets using a primary antibody binding the target itself and a fluorescent secondary antibody binding the primary that allows localizing the target11. In this case, a mouse monoclonal anti-53BP1 (1:50) and a rabbit polyclonal anti-γH2AX (1:50) are used as primary antibodies, while AlexaFluor568 anti-mouse (1:400) and DyLight488 anti-rabbit (1:200) are used as secondary antibodies, respectively.\n\t\nWash the slides two times in 50 mL of 1x PBS for 5 min in couplin jar (16 slides back-to-back).\nThen keep them for 30 min in blocking solution (10 mL of FBS, 10 mL of 10x PBS, 80 mL of deionized water, 300 µL of Triton-X).\nAdd to each slide 10 µL of each of the two solutions containing the primary antibodies dissolved in the blocking solution. Cover the slides with paraffin tape and incubate at 4 °C overnight.\nAfter incubation, perform three washing in 1x PBS for 5 min.\nAdd to each slide 10 µL of each of the two solutions containing the secondary antibodies dissolved in the blocking solution. Cover the slides with paraffin tape and incubate at room temperature for 2 h.\nPerform three washing in 1x PBS for 5 min.\nAdd 2.5 µL of antifade solution with DAPI on the coverslips before the assembly to counterstain the nuclei.",
    "​NOTE: In order to assess foci kinetics, the procedure is the same as described from 1.1 to 1.4, noting that cell harvesting and the dual immunofluorescence are performed at 0 h, after 2 h post-bleomycin treatment and then, after having removed the mutagen, at 4 h, 6 h, and 24 h post-treatment.\n2. Analysis through a fluorescence microscope\nNOTE: \"Fluorescence microscope\" refers to any microscope that uses fluorescence to generate an image. The specimen is illuminated with light of a specific wavelength (or wavelengths) which is absorbed by the fluorophores, causing them to emit light of longer wavelengths12. AlexaFluor568 and DyLight 488 absorb light of approximately 568 and 488 nm and emit light of 603 and 520 nm, respectively. Thus, they are visible as red or green fluorescence using a TRITC or a FITC filter, respectively.\nScore the presence of foci in each slide under a 100x immersion objective (Figure 1).\nScore 200 nuclei per slide and count the number of γH2AX/53BP1 foci in each nucleus.\nExpress results in terms of the average number of foci per total nuclei scored. These include both γH2AX/53BP1 positive (showing at least one fluorescence signal) and negative (not showing any fluorescence signal) nuclei.\nSubscription Required.
