    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTimings of this protocol are adjusted for one tumor from one mouse. By adding more samples, the timing will increase accordingly.\nNote: The maximum number of samples to handle at the same time is 8 for an experienced researcher to avoid compromising the quality and viability of the cells.\nNote: The time from tissue harvesting to single-cell capture should be the shortest possible, ideally 3.5–5.5 hours (depending on the abundance of your targeted cell population). It is not recommended long sample processing. In our hands, we have obtained good quality preparations from rare cell populations that require up to 12 h for alive single cell preparations.\nTissue harvesting\nTiming: 30 min\nTiming: for 8 samples: 1 h\nIn this section we explain the procedure for tumor harvesting. The most critical aspects are to avoid the areas containing necrosis and lymph nodes. This will ensure that we produce cell suspensions with a high content of viable cells and that the sample represents tumor heterogeneity.\nAlthough sterilized conditions are not necessary, tissue collection should be performed in a clean area using clean scissors and forceps. To clean surfaces and instruments wipe with a 70% ethanol solution\nEuthanize mice with CO2, followed by cervical dislocation (or according to the specific ethics guidelines), and harvest tissue by collecting only the regions with high content of viable tumor cells from epithelial mammary carcinomas, trying to exclude the necrotic areas and lymph nodes (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). As these areas are very challenging to identify, we perform a QC step to be able to select the highest quality samples to improve the sorting timing and to eliminate bias due to necrosis or lymphocyte contamination. Based on our experience, here we provide some suggestions to avoid collecting those specific regions.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1033-Fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2. Selection of regions with high content of viable tumor cells during tissue harvesting\n(A–C) Scatter plots that show an enrichment (red arrows) in lymphocytes that correspond to a lymph node (A), necrotic areas (B), and viable tumor tissue with high cellular content (C)\nNecrotic areas can be identified by looking at the texture, consistence and location of the tumor tissue. Viable tissue is compact and hard, located in the edges of the tumor mass. Necrotic areas are softer and with “mash-potato”-like consistency, usually located in the inner of the tumor mass.\nLymph node’s location can be expected under the nipple, where most of the blood vessels converge within the tumor.\nCritical: As necrosis and lymph nodes can be difficult to identify, and they can misrepresent tumour heterogeneity (problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]), we suggest to collect two separated samples from the same tumour or tissue (sample “A” and “B”). Then, in the QC of samples by flow cytometry step, the samples containing highly necrotic areas or lymph nodes can be discarded. This will avoid slowing down the sorting process and will increase the quality of the sample.\nManually dissect the tumor tissue into 3–5 mm pieces using a surgical scalpel blade.\nNote: The size range of the initial sample may vary depending on the tumour type and timepoint of harvesting. We recommend harvesting tumours of sizes between 500 – 2,000 mm3, or according to the specific Animal Ethics specifications.\nChop to 100 μm with maximum blade force on a McIlwain Tissue chopper for 2–3 passes.\nCritical: Ensure the cutting disc is not overloaded with more than 50% of the chopping surface covered by the tissue.\nPlace the chopped tissue in a 15 mL-Falcon tube containing 4.5 mL of 5% FBS/ DMEM High glucose.\nTissue digestion\nTiming: 1 h",
    "Timing: for 8 samples: 1.5 h\nThis section describes the enzymatic digestion of the tumor samples to obtain a single cell suspension.\nNote: All the resuspension steps should be done by pipetting at least 10 times.\nFor tissue digestion, samples are incubated in the following order:\nAdd 500 μL of collagenase-hyaluronidase (10×) to the 15 mL-Falcon tube containing the sample and 4.5 mL of 5% FBS/ DMEM High glucose.\nIncubate with 1× of collagenase-hyaluronidase at 37°C shaking at 200 rpm for 30 min in the Incu-Shaker™ 10 L Shaking Incubator.\nAt 15 min of the incubation process, to ensure the tissue is sufficiently resuspended, disrupt the tissue with by pipetting up and down with a p1000 set at 1 mL for at least 10 times.\nAlthough macroscopic tumor chunks can be still appreciated, a cloudy non-translucent medium indicates proper digestion of the tissue.\nWash the sample by adding 10 mL of cold DPBS to neutralize the digestion.\nCentrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDecant the content of the tube to discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet 100 μL of DNase solution.\nAdd 750 μL of TEG and pipette up and down for 1 min at 37°C in the water bath.\nFill up to 15 mL with 2% FBS/ DPBS.\nCentrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDecant the content of the tube to discard the supernatant.\nAdd 1.25 mL of Dispase solution to each pellet and incubate for 5 min in 37°C in the waterbath.\nResuspend the pellet in 50 μL of DNase solution and 450 mL of 2% FBS/ DPBS.\nAdd 2 mL of RBC lysis buffer, resuspend and incubate at 37°C in the water bath for 2 min.\nFill up to 15 mL with 2% FBS/ DPBS to neutralize.",
    "Centrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDecant the content of the tube to discard the supernatant\nNote: After this point, samples should be kept on ice at all times.\nResuspend pellet in 5–10 mL of cold 2% FBS/ DPBS and filter into 50 mL-Falcon tubes using a 40 μm cell sterile strainer.\nCount cells as explained in the cell count and viability step and prepare a single-cell suspension of 1 × 106–1 × 107 cells/ mL.\nTake between 50–150 K cells for the QC of samples by flow cytometry. The remaining cells are ready for options A or B.\nQuality check (QC) of cell viability and cellular content of samples by flow cytometry\nTiming: 30 min\nTiming: for 8 samples: 45 min\nDuring this step, cell viability and cellular content are analyzed and samples containing necrosis and/or lymph nodes are discarded.\nTo the single-cell suspension (50–150 K cells) from step 23 (in the tissue digestion[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2] section), do the QC as follows:\nFill up to 300 μL with 2% FBS/ DPBS.\nOptional: 3 μL of 50 μg/mL DAPI can be added before running the sample in the flow cytometer to verify viability after checking FSC and SSC.\nSet a flow cytometer instrument.\nPlace the sample in the flow cytometer and acquire and/or record ∼100,000 events.\nCategorize the cell preparation based on the FSC and SSC profile (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]), identifying the presence of lymph nodes in the harvested tissue (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, red arrow) or potential necrotic areas (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B, red arrow), as opposed to a typical tumor cell profile (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C, red arrow).",
    "If all samples show a high percentage of viable cells from the tumor tissue with absence of necrosis and/or lymph nodes, samples “A” and “B” can be pooled (see step 1 in the tissue harvesting[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1] section).\nProceed with option A or B, depending on the type of single-cell experiment, Option A will be unbiased and Option B will be targeted to a specific cell population within the tumor.\nOption A. Live population separation using autoMACS technology for unbiased single-cell downstream analysis\nTiming: 1 h\nTiming: for 8 samples: 2 h\nDuring autoMACS cleaning, the sample is enriched for live cells via Annexin-V antibody-based depletion. High viable cell suspensions are obtained using the Dead Cell Removal Kit (Miltenyi Biotec 130-090-101) and the autoMACS® Pro separator (Miltenyi Biotec).\nTransfer highly viable tumor samples from step 22 (in the tissue digestion[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2] section) into a 5 mL-FACS tube.\nCentrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nResuspend the pellet (107 or fewer cells) in 100 μL of the Dead Cell Removal microbeads from the Dead Cell Removal Kit.\nIncubate for 15 min at 20°C–22°C in the dark.\nDuring the 15 min-incubation time:\nPrepare fresh 1× of Annexin V Binding buffer by diluting 100 mL of 10× Annexin V Binding Buffer in 900 mL of RO Water.\nLabel two extra 5 mL-FACS tubes as negative and positive fraction. These are the collection tubes.\nSwitch on and set up the autoMACS® Pro separator as indicated in the manual.\nEquilibrate the column on the autoMACS Pro Separator with 1× of Annexin V Binding buffer and keep this buffer for the required washes.",
    "After 15 min of incubation (step 33), dilute the sample up to 800 μL by adding 700 μL of 1× Annexin V Binding buffer and place sample and the collection tubes in the 5 mL-rack from autoMACS® as explained in the manual.\nSeparate the live population (negative fraction) from the dead cells by using the DepleteS program in the autoMACS® Pro separator.\nNote: During the autoMACS® separation is expected a ∼40%–50% cell loss.\nClean up and shutdown autoMACS® Pro separator following manufactures’ instructions.\nOptional: Check the live fraction separated by autoMACS under flow cytometry using DAPI (0.5 μg/mL final concentration) to corroborate the high viability of the cell suspension (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3])\nThe high viable cell fraction is ready for counting.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1033-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Data represented as mean ± SD. ∗∗∗∗ p value < 0.0001.\nOption B. Sorting of the population of interest using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for targeted single-cell downstream analysis\nTiming: varies depending on the sorted population.\nTiming: for 100 K tumour infiltrated immune (CD45+) cells, 200 K cancer cells (mCherry+) and 10 K of stromal cells (CD45-, mCherry-): 3–3.5 h\nDuring FACS sorting, the population of interest is selected by using antibodies against specific cell surface markers. As an example, in this protocol we focus on the sorting of immune cells (CD45+), tumor cells (expressing mCherry+) and stromal cells (defined as double negative population) from murine mammary tumors.\nNote: All the steps from this section should be performed at 4°C.",
    "Transfer 2.5–5 × 106 cells from highly viable tumor samples from step 22 (in the tissue digestion[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2] section) into a 5 mL-FACS tube.\nCentrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nResuspend the pellet in a final volume of 500 μL of a solution containing 2% FBS/DPBS and anti-mouse CD45 antibody with the desired conjugated fluorophore at the recommended dilution. In the example shown here we used PE/Cyanine7 anti-mouse CD45 (Biolegend Cat#103114) Dilution 1:400.\nNote: Make sure the fluorophore chosen doesn’t overlap with DAPI spectrum.\nNote: A flow cytometry antibody titration may be required to optimize the staining and to fix a dilution factor for that specific fluorophore-conjugated antibody.\nIncubate on ice for 30 min.\nDuring the 30 min-incubation time, prepare the collection tube by adding 100 μL of FBS in one 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nNote: Make sure the FBS cover all the wall of the tube to avoid cell dead when sorting as the sorted cells can be deposited in the walls instead on the bottom of the tube during the procedure.\nAfter the 30-min incubation (step 42), wash the sample by adding 1 mL of 2% FBS/DPBS and centrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDecant the contents of the tube to discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL of 2% FBS/DPBS.\nKeep the sample on ice and in the dark until FACS sorting.\nSet up the nozzle size at 100 μm on the BD FACSAria™ III sorter.",
    "Set up the gating strategy by selecting the cellular compartment in the FSC-A and SSC-A dot plot. Exclude doublets using FSC-A and FSC-H, select the negative fraction for DAPI and gate the positive cells for CD45 and mCherry. See Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] as an example of the gating strategy with the PE/Cyanine7 anti-mouse CD45 Antibody (Ex: 561 Em: 780) and mCherry (Ex: 561 Em: 610).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1033-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Example of gating strategy for cancer, stromal, and immune alive cells by FACS sorting\nImmune cells are labeled with the CD45 -PE-Cy7 fluorophore and cancer cells are differentiated from stromal cells by the expression of the mCherry.\nAdd 10 μL of 50 μg/mL DAPI and incubate for 3–5 min.\nInsert the DAPI-stained sample in the sample injection chamber of the BD FACSAria™ III sorter.\nAdjust voltage for FSC, SSC and the lasers for the fluorophores used.\nInsert the collection tube on the sort collection chamber.\nSet up the desired number of events to collect.\nNote: As the number of cells returned from the sorter depends on different factors, including sort precision and efficiency, we usually assume that a 50% loss of the targeted cell population will be the “worse-case scenario.” Therefore, we recommend set up the desire number of events to 200 K when aiming 100 K cells.\nProceed with the sorting of CD45+ DAPI- (live immune cells), mCherry+ DAPI- (live cancer cells) and CD45-, mCherry- and DAPI- (live stromal cells) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], right panel).\nNote: In mammary gland tumours, we estimate that ∼12%–25% of the total number of events corresponds to CD45+cells, ∼60–80% to cancer cells and ∼2%–8% to stromal cells. This translates to ∼ 1–2 h of sorting needed of immune cells, ∼20 min of cancer cells and >2 h of stromal cells for 200 K cells of each type.",
    "After sorting, proceed to count the total number of cells obtained and prepare the recommended cell concentration for your specific single-cell application.\nCell counting and viability measurements\nTiming: 30 min\nTiming: for 8 samples: 1 h\nIn this section we explain how to perform cell counting of viable cells using 0.4% Trypan blue solution and a hemocytometer.\nNote: For cell counting, a 0.4% Trypan blue solution is added to the sample to distinguish live from dead cells. Live cells will be bright under the microscope, while dead cells will be stained with the dye acquiring the blue color and losing the brightness. When preparing single cell suspension, the concentration should be based just of the live fraction of the sample.\nPlace a glass cover on the central area of a hemocytometer.\nAdjust the cell concentration of your sample in the recommended range (2.5 × 106–2 × 105 cells/ mL) by:\nDiluting with 2% FBS in PBS Buffer if it is too concentrated (if you estimate that you have more than 2.5 × 106 cells/ mL)\nCentrifuging at 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C and resuspending in less volume of the used buffer if it is too diluted (if you estimate that you have less than 200,000 cells/ mL)\nNote: The concentration can be estimated based on the turbidity of the sample and also based on the expected number of cells from step 36 from option A or step 55 from Option B. A very concentrated sample will look opaque, while a very diluted sample will look transparent. A light translucent sample should work for counting the cells with the hemocytometer.",
    "Resuspend the sample by pipetting up and down 10 times and take 5 μL with a p20 pipette and mix with 5 μL of Trypan blue on a new tube.\nPlace the 10 μL of the mix in a hemocytometer, by positioning the loaded p20 pipette on the glass of the hemocytometer, close to the glass cover edge and releasing the sample carefully.\nNote: Count the cells right after adding the trypan blue. Incubating cells in trypan blue for too long can give false blue positive cells.\nPlace the loaded hemocytometer in the microscope, turn the light on and focus until you can see the grid squares.\nCount the bright cells within the 16 squares of the 4 sets of big squares (A1, A2, A3, A4) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1033-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

The blue lines indicate the borders to be considered for counting the cells that sit on these borderlines. Cells in yellow indicate the cells excluded from the counting grid and blue cells represent dead cells labeled with trypan blue.\nNote: We generally obtain ∼90% of live cells, counted by trypan blue exclusion.\nTo calculate the concentration of the cells in your sample (cells/ mL) follow the formula:\n  Concentration   (  cells mL  )  =  (   A 1 + A 2 + A 3 + A 4  4  )  × 10,000  cells ml  × 2",
    "Note: A1-A4: represent the number of cells counted in each of the 4 sets of 16 squares, that is expected to be similar among them if there is a good resuspension of the sample. 4 is the number of sets that have been counted. 10,000 cells/mL is the equivalent of cell concentration of the surface of each set counted. 2 is the dilution factors used with trypan blue dye\nCalculate the number of the total cells in your sample following the formula:\n  Total number of cells =  cell concentration  (  cells mL  )  ×  Sample volume   ( mL )"
