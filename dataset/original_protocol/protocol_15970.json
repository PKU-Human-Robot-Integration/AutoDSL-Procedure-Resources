    "Most macrophage fate-mapping models utilize fluorescent reporter activation following Cre-recombinase–induced genetic recombination to label a population of interest. Therefore, precise and efficient induction of Cre becomes critical in fate-mapping experiments. Mice expressing a Cre protein under the control of the estrogen-nuclear receptor require exposure to tamoxifen (an estrogen analog) for translocation to the nucleus. The following Basic Protocol, adapted from the Jackson Laboratory, describes a tamoxifen preparation for adult animals (Heffner, 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-bib-0035]; Madisen et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-bib-0051]; Sohal et al., 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-bib-0071]) that can be applied to any inducible fate mappers.\nTamoxifen is a chemically hazardous substance that must be handled appropriately. Administration procedures and mice receiving tamoxifen should be performed and housed in an approved facility under approved procedures. It is important to note that the tamoxifen should be prepared in light-blocking vessels, as it is light sensitive. The solution should be kept at 4°C (short term) or −20°C (up to 6 months). In addition, tamoxifen is provided as a prohormone that is transformed in the liver into the bioactive form 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OH-tamoxifen), which has significantly enhanced binding affinity for the estrogen receptor (Furr & Jordan, 1984[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-bib-0023]). Tamoxifen has proven effective in adult mice or pregnant mothers, but OH-tamoxifen may be preferred in some scenarios, such as targeting cells in vitro.\nMaterials\nExperimental mice (expressing creER and fluorescent reporter constructs)\nThe described procedure was optimized using the CX3CR1creER/WT (strain #020940, Jackson Laboratory) R26tdTomato (strain #007909, Jackson Laboratory) mouse strain on a C57bl/6 background at 8 weeks of age. This procedure is effective in both male and female mice. Experimental cohort size is suggested to start at 5-6 animals for each treatment group and adjust needed animal numbers based on observed variation and detectable differences within the experimental model. This is typically performed using a power calculation following initial pilot studies.",
    "Tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich #10540-29-1)\nCorn oil (Sigma-Aldrich #C8267)\nGavage feeding needle (or tube) with a round tip\n1-ml syringe (BD #309628)\nLight-blocking vessel/foil wrap\nIncubating orbital shaker\nSmall animal scale\nLaminar flow hood (Biosafety Class II (BSL2) or equivalent)\n1. Working in a BSL2 biosafety cabinet, prepare 20 mg/ml tamoxifen in corn oil: dissolve tamoxifen in sterile corn oil by placing it on a shaking platform overnight at 37°C. This is done in a light-blocking vessel (ex. Foil-wrapped).\nStorage at 4°C is for short-term use for up to 2 months. Aliquots can be taken from the stock but should be replaced if contamination is observed.\n2. Weigh animals on a scale prior to starting the procedure.\n3. Determine the gavage dose by weight, 200 mg/kg for our example strain CX3CR1creER R26tdTomato\nFor new strains, we suggest starting with treatments in the range of 75-250 mg tamoxifen/kg body weight. This has been effective for most mouse models that we have tested.\n4. Remove the tamoxifen in corn oil solution from the refrigerator to a rocking plate 30 min prior to the gavage procedure to allow it to come to room temperature and become evenly mixed.\n5. Administer tamoxifen via oral gavage.\n         \nUse blunt-tip gavage or feeding needles according to mouse size and connect to a 1-ml syringe. Small animals will require a 22 gauge (FST #18061-22), whereas adult animals can accommodate a larger 18-gauge needle (FST #18061-50). Fill the syringe with tamoxifen solution.",
    "Two groups of animals for control treatment are ideal for tamoxifen-mediated fate-mapping experiments. The first control group is treated with vehicle alone (corn oil) in the same volume as step 5a, using the same creER reporter mouse strain. This should act as a negative control, and treatment should not induce fluorescence labeling. The second control group comprises tamoxifen-treated mice that do not carry the creER or fluorescent reporter, allowing confirmation of whether tamoxifen treatment leads to any defects.\nRestrain the animal by firmly grasping the neck skin over the shoulders so that the animal is stationary and the neck is vertical during the gavage.\nInsert the gavage needle in the diastema and advance the needle until the tip is fully inserted. If the needle is placed appropriately in the esophagus, the operation should exhibit minimal resistance. Do not force the needle if any resistance is experienced.\nDispense the tamoxifen solution (∼200 µl; dose will depend upon the mouse strain being used).\nOnce gavage is completed, gently retrieve the needle along the insertion angle.\nRelease the animal back to the cage and observe for signs of distress or abnormal breathing. Monitor the animal for 5-10 min before returning the cage to housing.\n6. Animals should be closely monitored and weighed daily following the procedure to detect any adverse reactions to the gavage or tamoxifen exposure.",
    "Observation is necessary to ensure that the gavage technique was performed effectively. Poor gavage technique may result in acute respiratory distress, which can be observed within 10 min of gavage and may result in the animal's death. Tamoxifen exposure has been reported to reduce animal activity immediately following treatment (Chen, Wu, Shi, & Xu, 2002a[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-bib-0008]; Li et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-bib-0046]). Weight loss in the days following gavage is unexpected and might indicate tamoxifen overdose in your animal strain. Higher tamoxifen dosing or prolonged treatment may result in toxicity that can lead to mortality, particularly when tamoxifen is given at doses above 250 mg/kg or if a strain is found to be highly sensitive. Tamoxifen toxicity has been reported in a number of studies to be associated with gastric dysfunction, liver damage, retinal epithelial cell death, nervous system dysfunction, and other phenotypes (Bersell et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-bib-0006]; Chen, Wu, Shi, & Xu, 2002b[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-bib-0009]; Hameyer et al., 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-bib-0031]; Huh et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-bib-0040]). Thus, limiting tamoxifen exposure for the strain of interest and titering the dose is very important.\n7. CreER activity and reporter expression can be monitored by flow cytometry or imaging analysis (outlined in Support Protocols). In some strains, recombination can be observed within hours of tamoxifen administration. If the efficiency in the target cell population is unsatisfactory, additional tamoxifen doses may be required and can be administered on consecutive days.\nIn our example strain, CX3CR1creER R26tdTomato, a single tamoxifen gavage will label ∼85% to 90% of circulating blood monocytes after 1 day (measured by flow cytometry), but 3 consecutive tamoxifen gavages over 3 days will label >98% of circulating blood monocytes. Thus, the treatment regime can be optimized for the desired labeling efficiency for your tissue and cell type of interest.",
    "8. Animals can be sacrificed at any time after tamoxifen treatment to analyze the labeling of cells of interest. Experimental data are provided in Supporting Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-prot-0005] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-prot-0006] for examples of flow cytometry analyses of blood and cells isolated from brain tissue and cells imaged after cryosectioning of the adrenal glands and heart. Sacrifice time points can be performed as early as the day following tamoxifen labeling or can be extended even months after tamoxifen exposure for long-term fate-mapping experiments (Williams et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-bib-0077]).",
    "Intraperitoneal (IP) injection is a common alternative to oral gavage. For IP injection, we chose tamoxifen dissolved in sterile corn oil (adapted from Jackson Labs (Heffner, 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-bib-0035])). However, other oil options would be adequate substitutes, such as sunflower oil, which is a slightly better solvent for tamoxifen. One concern with the IP approach is that it will disrupt tissue-resident macrophages in the peritoneal cavity, as the large bolus of oil will cause some level of cell death in the large peritoneal macrophage population.\nAdditional Materials\n3/8 26-G beveled needle (BD #305111)\n70% Ethanol for disinfection\n1. Weigh the animal prior to injection.\n2. Draw tamoxifen solution (20 mg/ml tamoxifen in corn oil) into the syringe. We commonly use 100 µl for our CX3CR1creER strain, but the dose should be adjusted for each strain of interest.\n3. Scruff the animal and position it head-down.\n4. Administer tamoxifen via IP injection (adopted from UBC Animal Care Guidelines for IP injection (Andrews, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-bib-0003])).\n         \nSterilize the area of injection with 70% ethanol to prevent infection.\nLocate the injection site in the lower right quadrant of the abdomen.\nWhile holding the syringe parallel to the mouse tail, gently insert the needle with the bevel facing up. The action must be done with caution to avoid damage to the abdominal organs, including the urinary bladder and cecum.\nDepress the plunger to dispense the desired volume and gently extract the needle.\nReturn the animal to the cage and monitor for any adverse reactions.\nAcute responses will typically be observed within an hour of treatment and would likely be associated with poor injection technique. Other potential adverse reactions, such as weight loss, can be monitored over a series of days following treatment and would likely suggest the tamoxifen dosage was too high.",
    "5. Repeat steps #2-4 for consecutive or alternating days to label the desired cell populations. Throughout treatment, animals should be closely monitored daily and weighed to assess them for adverse reactions. For strains or experiments requiring more than 3 doses of tamoxifen, researchers should consider Alternative Protocol #2.",
    "Overexposure to tamoxifen can cause CreER over-activation, leading to DNA damage and higher mortality in the animals (Bersell et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-bib-0006]). This is especially true when consecutive and acute tamoxifen pulsing is performed. Here, we introduce the tamoxifen-enriched diet to avoid aggressive pulsing. This is a particularly favored method for continuous labeling. To induce consistent and effective Cre-recombination, we suggest a minimum 2-week feeding period (300-500 mg tamoxifen per kg of food). Importantly, specialized diets can be designed with diet manufacturers, such as a tamoxifen-enriched high-fat diet. A potential concern with this method is that animals will resist the transition to the tamoxifen diet because it has a different texture and flavor than the normal diet. This may result in weight loss or even aggressive behaviors between animals. To improve mouse appetite, some tamoxifen-diet can be softened with water and placed on the cage floor to make intake easier for animals undergoing diet transition. If the mice still refuse to eat, they can be rotated between the tamoxifen diet and normal chow for an alternating feeding cycle of 5 days on and 2 days off to maintain animal health.\nAdditional Materials\nTamoxifen-supplemented diet (such as Harlan, Envigo Teklad Custom diet TD.130857)\n1. Weigh mice prior to the diet switch.\n2. Provide softened tamoxifen-enriched food pellets on the cage floor to assist in diet transition.\n3. House animals with the tamoxifen-supplemented diet for a minimum period of 2 weeks.\nIn most animal strains we have worked with, we have observed that animals slowly transition to the new diet and will take up to 2 weeks of treatment to demonstrate significant recombination in target cell populations.",
    "4. Animals should be weighed daily and monitored for any health concerns. Weight loss greater than 10% should be discussed with veterinary staff and may require nutrient supplementation.\nWe have consistently observed weight loss of up to 10% of total animal weight when transitioning to a tamoxifen-enriched diet. Therefore, we suggest avoiding placing very young mice on the diet until at least 8 weeks of age, as they are more sensitive to weight fluctuations. Using a high-fat, tamoxifen-enriched diet appears to have a less dramatic effect and is eaten more readily by experimental mice. Additional alternative diet-treatment options were discussed in the introduction to this section, including diet cycling, which can help to avoid undesired weight fluctuation.\n5. If a tamoxifen-enriched diet does not effectively induce Cre-recombination in the target cells of interest after a 2-week period, consider longer treatment or use an alternative approach such as gavage or IP administration.",
    "Embryonic fate-mapping experiments allow for the tracking of macrophages that derive from distinct developmental stages, including yolk sac, fetal liver, or bone marrow origins. Macrophage ontogeny may influence the function of cells in some tissues. To investigate the origin of the macrophages that seed tissues and organs, an embryonic labeling technique is introduced (Perdiguero & Geissmann, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-bib-0057]; Schulz et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-bib-0069]). To perform this assay, timed breeder pairs need to be arranged so that tamoxifen can be administered at the appropriate developmental time points, such as yolk sac (E7.5-8.5), fetal liver (E12.5-14.5), or HSC (E18.5+). As outlined in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-prot-0001], tamoxifen can be administered to pregnant mothers by gavage or IP injection.\nSince tamoxifen is an estrogen analog, it can disrupt the ability of some mothers to give natural birth and can lead to late-term fetal abortion. Therefore, pregnant mothers should be given the lowest tamoxifen dose possible to induce the recombination to the desired efficiency. Additionally, it has been suggested that the addition of progesterone to embryonic tamoxifen treatment may help to avoid lost litters (Nakamura et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-bib-0054]). Since these experiments are being performed in vivo, mice can receive unprocessed tamoxifen. However, an important consideration is if embryos are being pulsed ex vivo or cells are being labeled in vitro, the bioactive 4OH-tamoxifen form will need to be used since tamoxifen requires processing in the liver to become active (Hayashi & McMahon, 2002[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-bib-0034]). Since tamoxifen treatment, particularly when performed late in gestation, may lead to failure to give birth, mice may need to be sacrificed for cesarean section on embryonic day 20-21 (Murphy, 1993[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-bib-0053]), and recipient foster mothers will adopt the delivered pups. The following Basic Protocol section describes maternal tamoxifen gavage to induce CreER recombination and fluorescent protein expression in mouse embryos.\nMaterials",

Studding the desired male mouse for 1-2 weeks increases sperm counts and hormone levels. When possible, use males that have proven to be effective breeders. Males should be at minimum 8 weeks of age and can be used at an older age than females. Males can be used effectively out to 8 months of age if they have a history of successful breeding.\n2. Select female breeders that are at least 8 weeks of age and not beyond 16 weeks of age to enhance the likelihood of successful mating. Mate timed breeders of interest together for one night, then separated the following morning.\nVerifying the female is in the appropriate estrous state (proestrus or estrus) will help improve timed breeding success.\n3. Visually check for a vaginal plug when separating the breeding pair to confirm if copulation occurred overnight.\nA vaginal plug may be observed and can persist for 8-24 hr after mating. However, the plugs from some strains, C57BL/6 in particular, may be thin and dissolve rapidly. Seeing a plug is a positive indication that mating occurred but does not imply successful pregnancy. Additionally, the lack of a plug does not imply that copulation did not happen.\n4. Weigh the females each day to document weight gain and confirm successful pregnancy.\n5. Perform labeling for the fate-mapping procedure by oral tamoxifen gavage (as outlined in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-prot-0001]) or IP tamoxifen injection of pregnant females at the time point of interest.",
    "Treatment is typically performed at E7.5-E8.5 for yok sac labeling, E11.5-E14.5 for fetal liver labeling, and for late embryonic time points, E18.5 might be useful for identifying cells that developed prior to birth. Please see Adult Fate Mapping Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-prot-0001] for tamoxifen administration procedures. For these experiments, a single dose is typically used to restrict the labeling window. For CX3CR1creER R26tdTomato labeling data provided in Figure 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-fig-0001], pregnant dams received ∼200 mg/kg dosing by gavage at E14.5.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/63983720-82df-4520-878e-97b1ec7332d8/cpz1456-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nFlow cytometry analysis of fate-mapped monocytes and macrophages.\nA. CX3CR1creER R26tdTomato reporter mice were labeled in utero, embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5), by tamoxifen gavage of pregnant mothers. Labeled pups were weaned and then sacrificed at 8 weeks of age and assessed for labeling efficiency in brain microglia and blood. (Left panel) Brain microglia (CD45+ CD11b+ CD64+, Red line) were labeled with >98% efficiency from embryonic exposure to tamoxifen, whereas unlabeled age-matched mice showed no labeling (control, Gray line). (Right panel) In the same mice, blood at 8 weeks of age showed no labeling of blood monocytes (CD45+ CD11b+ Ly6G- CD115+) in E14.5 labeled (Red) or control (Gray).\nB. CCR2creER R26tdTomato reporter mice were gavaged with a single dose of tamoxifen, and labeling efficiency in the blood was analyzed 16 hr later. T cells (CD45+ TCRβ+), B Cells (CD45+ CD19+), Neutrophil (CD45+ CD11b+ Ly6G+), Ly6C- Monocytes (CD45+ CD11b+ Ly6G- CD115+ Ly6C-), and Ly6C+ Monocytes (CD45+ CD11b+ Ly6G- CD115+ Ly6C+) were assessed for tdTomato labeling, where Ly6C monocytes were efficiently labeled.\nCaesarian section of the pregnant female, adapted from Murphy, 1993[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-bib-0053]\n6. Continue to monitor and weigh the pregnant mice daily to detect any adverse reactions, such as lost litter.\n7. Females reaching E21 without giving natural birth may require surgical recovery of the pups.",
    "8. Euthanize the pregnant female via cervical dislocation.\nSome female timed breeders may go into dystocia or fail to birth their entire litter, so animals should be monitored many times daily, and staff should be prepared for C-section on or after E19.5.\n9. Clean the abdomen with ethanol and cut open with sterile scissors. This will expose the uterus and allow access to the oviduct.\n10. Remove the pups one at a time from membranes and cut the umbilical cord.\n11. Wipe fluids from the pups’ face/mouth area using paper towels and check for breathing. Rhythmic chest pumping with forceps can be used to help assist breathing if pups do not immediately begin to take breaths.\n12. Foster pups immediately in a cage with a fresh litter. This cage should be kept on a heating pad to maintain the temperature at approximately 32°C.\n13. Donor mice should be mixed with foster pups to help facilitate acceptance by the foster mother. Rubbing new pups with nestlets or bedding from the new cage will enhance foster acceptance of new pups.\n14. Embryonic labeled pups can then be assessed for labeling efficiency across tissues by flow cytometry or imaging analysis (discussed in Support Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-prot-0005] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-prot-0006]).\nFor labeling efficiency of embryonically derived macrophages, the brain is often examined since microglia are exclusively derived from yolk sac progenitor cells (data provided in Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-fig-0001]). Additional control data can be collected, such as assessing blood cells for labeling efficiency to address any potential for unwanted “off-target” recombination, since blood monocytes are exclusively derived from bone marrow HSCs in the adult mice and should not be labeled. Embryonic labeled mice are often studied early, at 1 or 2 weeks after birth or later into early adulthood (8-12 weeks of age).",
    "Flow cytometry remains a core technology that enables researchers to access the cellular composition within a tissue of interest. It is ideal for analyzing fate mapping results, as the targeted myeloid cells are labeled and become fluorescently active after tamoxifen-induced CreER activation. However, to perform flow cytometry, the tissue samples need to be completely dissociated into a single-cell suspension. This process negates the ability to assess any type of cell localization. Despite this disadvantage, flow cytometry still serves an essential role in fate-mapping experiments due to its high throughput and ease of quantification across multiple samples. In addition, flow cytometry can be used as a cell sorting approach to allow for the isolation of labeled cells. Sorting strategies will follow this protocol, followed by additional techniques such as in vitro culture or lysis for gene expression analysis, like single-cell RNA sequencing. The following protocol describes the materials and necessary steps for a successful flow cytometry experiment, but for the overarching purpose of this protocol, tissue dissociation and desired staining panels will need to be optimized for each organ being addressed. Please reference the recent protocol focused on assessing myeloid cells across tissues using flow cytometry for optimizing antibody staining panel design (Liu, Gu, Shin, Zhang, & Ginhoux, 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-bib-0049]).\nMaterials and Reagents\nMice to be sacrificed for tissue and blood harvest\nCO2 source\nIce-cold PBS\nFACS Buffer: 0.1% EDTA, 10% FBS in HBSS (see recipe)\nHBSS (ThermoFisher #88284)\n0.5M EDTA (AccuGENE #51201)\nDiluted EDTA: 10% EDTA in PBS\nDistilled water\nRed Blood Cell Lysis Buffer 1X (10X RBC, BioLegend #420301, 10% in distilled water) (see recipe)\nRPMI-1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, R8758) with 2% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (Sigma-Aldrich, F2442)\nPercoll (Sigma-Aldrich, P1644)\nFlow cytometry antibodies (Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-tbl-0001])\nTable 1..\n                Basic Flow Cytometry Panel for Myeloid Cells\ntable:\n﻿CD45,All leukocytes\nLy6G,Neutrophils\nCD11b,Myeloid cells",

Additional digestion protocols can be found in the literature for tissues of interest. Fresh tissue should be used for flow cytometry analysis, but single-cell suspensions can be fixed and stored for delayed analysis once isolated and stained with antibodies. Regardless, it is suggested to run samples on a flow cytometer as quickly as possible to limit any potential issues with cell viability or decay of the fluorescence signal.\nTissue fixation, then immunofluorescence imaging (supporting protocol #2). Fresh tissue can also be embedded directly in OCT for sectioning (fresh-frozen), where samples should be kept at −20°C for storage.

Mix well with a 1-ml pipette by pipetting up and down to further dissociate the cells.\n20. Transfer brain mix to a 15-ml conical tube and fill to 7 ml final volume with additional RPMI/2% FBS.\n21. Make a 30/70 Percoll gradient by adding 3 ml of 100% Percoll to the sample solution. Underlay the cells with a 70% Percoll solution diluted in 1× PBS.\n22. Centrifuge the Percoll gradient at 850 × g and 20°C for 20 min. Spin cells with the brake “off” or reduced to level 1 on the swing-bucket centrifuge.\n23. Carefully collect cells from the gradient interface using a pipette and transfer to a fresh conical tube.\n24. Wash cells with 5 ml RPMI/2% FBS and centrifuge at 800 × g and 4°C for 5 min.\n25. Aspirate supernatant, resuspend in 1 ml FACS buffer.\n26. Count cells using a hemacytometer or counting instrument.\n27. Add ∼1 million cells to each flow cytometry tube. This number can be adjusted for the tissue of interest, but antibody staining cocktail concentrations may need to be adjusted for increased cell numbers.\nAntibody Labeling for Flow Cytometry or Cell Sorting",
    "1. Sample tubes, unstained controls, and single-stained controls should be organized. Compensation beads (such as ThermoFisher UltraComp Beads, cat. #01-2222-41) or cells can be used for single-stained controls in most experimental setups.\n2. Centrifuge cells and remove supernatant.\n3. For antibody labeling, stain at 1 µg/ml (or as titered) in a 50-µl volume of FACS buffer for 20 min in the dark, on ice. Antibody cocktails should be prepared as a master mix to help limit any potential pipetting errors.\nAn example staining panel is provided in Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-tbl-0001] for a general monocyte/macrophage staining approach that can be useful for most tissues. These cells can then be assessed for labeling efficiency in fate-mapping experiments.\n4. Add 1 ml of FACS buffer to each tube to wash the samples.\n5. Centrifuge for 5 min at 800 × g and 4°C.\n6. Head to the flow cytometer to collect data or the cell sorter for cell isolation.\nTable 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-tbl-0001] outlines some common cell surface markers used in flow cytometry to identify monocytes and macrophages. A common gating strategy for exclusion of neutrophil contamination using Ly6G and identification of macrophages by MerTK and CD64 co-expression is effective across most mouse tissues. For blood monocyte identification, we typically propose using a combination of CD45+ CD11b+ Ly6G- CD115+. This population can then be further separated using CCR2, Ly6C, or CX3CR1 into classical (CCR2+ Ly6C+ CX3CR1lo) or nonclassical (CCR2- Ly6C- CX3CR1hi) lineages. Once separated, cells can be assessed for expression of fluorescent reporter proteins such as tdTomato or GFP.",
    "Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-fig-0001] provides example flow cytometry data from fate-mapping experiments. Figure 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-fig-0001] followed embryonic fate-mapping strategies outlined in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-prot-0004]. Pregnant CX3CR1creER R26tdTomato reporter mice were treated with a single dose of tamoxifen (200 mg/kg) by gavage when pups were at embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5). Labeled pups were born, then sacrificed at 8 weeks of age as adult mice to fate-map the ability of embryonic cells to seed into adult macrophage lineages. Brain microglia (CD45+ CD11b+ CD64+) were labeled with >98% efficiency from embryonic exposure to tamoxifen. In the same mice, blood at 8 weeks of age showed no labeling of blood monocytes (CD45+ CD11b+ Ly6G- CD115+). Figure 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-fig-0001] illustrates the adult fate-mapping experiment described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-prot-0001], using CCR2creER R26tdTomato reporter mice. This strain will label CCR2-expressing cells with tdTomato protein following tamoxifen exposure. Mice were gavaged with a single dose of tamoxifen (200 mg/kg). The mice were bled 16 hr later for tdTomato labeling analysis. T cells (CD45+ TCRβ+), B Cells (CD45+ CD19+), Neutrophils (CD45+ CD11b+ Ly6G+), Ly6C- Monocytes (CD45+ CD11b+ Ly6G- CD115+ Ly6C-), and Ly6C+ Monocytes (CD45+ CD11b+ Ly6G- CD115+ Ly6C+) were assessed for tdTomato labeling. Only Ly6C+ monocytes were efficiently labeled.",
    "To answer questions regarding cell population localization, an immunostaining method is introduced in this section. This protocol can often supplement flow cytometry to determine whether labeled cells of interest are localizing to features or regions of the organ of interest. Experiments can be performed in whole-mount or following tissue sectioning. This approach is frequently paired with antibody labeling followed by fluorescence imaging. A detailed process for cryostat operation and immunohistochemistry staining is provided in the protocol UNIT 21.4 (Hofman & Taylor, 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-bib-0039]). This protocol will only provide a brief overview of the approach.\nMaterials\nOCT (Sakura Tissue-Tek O.C.T Compound #4583)\nDry ice\n4% PFA fixation buffer (see recipe)\nTriton X-100 (tx-100) (Sigma-Aldrich, #T8787)\nAntibody of choice\n12-well plate (Sigma Aldrich Corning Costar TC-Treated Multiple Well Plates #CLS527)\nCryostat\nCoverslips\nConfocal microscope instrument\nLeica software\nSample Fixation and Processing\nFixation in Paraformaldehyde (PFA)\n1. Submerge freshly isolated samples in 4% PFA in PBS containing 30% sucrose. The addition of sucrose prevents fluorescence quenching. Samples can be kept at 4°C. The time required for appropriate fixation will vary for each tissue based on size and density. Samples like heart or kidney typically require overnight incubation.\nAdditional fixation strategies can be used, but over-fixation may result in quenching fluorescent reporter proteins. These proteins can often be stained using antibodies (such as anti-GFP) if endogenous fluorescence is lost.\n2. For storage beyond 2 days, samples can be transferred to 1× PBS or 30% sucrose solution only for samples that will undergo cryosectioning.\nEmbedding in OCT and Cryosectioning\n3. Trim sample to desired size. Sample can be previously fixed in PFA/sucrose or freshly isolated (fresh-frozen). Fixed samples should be floated in 30% sucrose for 12 hr prior to embedding.",
    "4. Place a metal plate or mount on dry ice (metal will allow for rapid energy transfer and faster freezing).\n5. Drop a dab of OCT on the metal and, when partially frozen, place the tissue sample onto the OCT base with forceps. Cover the sample with more OCT and let the OCT freeze completely.\n6. Trim the OCT-tissue block to the desired size with a razor blade.\n7. Store the sample embedded in OCT at −20°C until ready to section.\n8. Section samples on a cryostat to the desired size (often 5-20 µm) and adhere to positively charged glass slides.\nImmunofluorescence Staining and Imaging\n1. Cryosectioned samples should be warmed to room temperature on the bench.\n2. Excess OCT should be washed away with two 5-min incubations in 1× PBS.\n3. Staining regions can be defined by a hydrophobic marker to restrict the amount of solution needed for immunostaining.\n4. Block and permeabilize samples using 5% donkey serum diluted in 0.1% tx-100. Blocking solution and permeabilization buffers can be adjusted for the tissue/staining approach. Stain for 30 min at room temperature.\nRemember to cover your slides to shield them from light during the staining procedure to protect the fluorescent reporter proteins.\n5. Wash with 1× PBS.\n6. Stain with primary antibodies (diluted 1:500, or as titered) in 1× PBS solution for 1 hr at room temperature.\n7. Wash three times with 1× PBS.\nStaining times and treatment conditions may require optimization for the antigens being detected. For example, it may be desirable to stain at 4°C or extend the staining time to overnight.\n8. Stain with secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorescent proteins (diluted 1:500 or as titered) in 1× PBS solution for 1 hr at room temperature.\n9. Wash three times with 1× PBS.",
    "10. Mount samples with a fluorescence-mounting medium and place glass coverslip.\n11. Collect images by epifluorescence or confocal microscopy.\nFigure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-fig-0002] shows example confocal microscope images of cryosectioned fate-mapped samples. Figure 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-fig-0002] was obtained using Adult Fate-Mapping Protocol 1 using a single gavage of tamoxifen using the CCR2creER R26tdTomato CX3CR1gfp dual reporter strain. Mice were gavaged, then sacrificed 48 hr later. Adrenal glands were assessed for tdTomato and GFP expression to determine the distribution of differentially expressing cells. Figure 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-fig-0002] was obtained using the continuous tamoxifen approach to fate mapping in the context of atherosclerosis progression. CX3CR1creER R26tdTomato Ldlr-/- mice are susceptible to atherosclerosis following high-fat diet feeding. To induce tdTomato expression on monocytes and macrophages and promote plaque formation in the arteries, reporter animals were fed a tamoxifen-enriched high fat diet for 8 weeks (continuously). Mice were sacrificed and the hearts isolated and sectioned to 10 µm. Samples were stained for smooth muscle actin (SMA) and DAPI for nuclei. Samples were imaged by confocal microscopy for localization of tdTomato-expressing macrophages within atherosclerotic lesions (Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.456#cpz1456-fig-0002]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/35982d6f-269b-4c6e-bee5-8c007e867ffd/cpz1456-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nFluorescent imaging analysis of fate-mapped macrophages in tissues.\nA. Dual reporter CCR2creER R26tdTomato CX3CR1gfp mice were given a single gavage of tamoxifen (200 mg/kg) and then sacrificed 48 hr later. Adrenal glands were cryosectioned and assessed by confocal microscopy for tdTomato (red) and GFP (green) expression to determine the distribution of differentially expressing cells. Nuclei are labeled with Dapi staining (blue).\nB. CX3CR1creER R26tdTomato Ldlr-/- mice were continuously fed a tamoxifen-enriched high fat diet to induce atherosclerosis while labeling all CX3CR1-expressing monocytes and macrophages throughout disease progression. After 8 weeks, hearts were collected, fixed in PFA/sucrose, and cryosectioned. Samples were immunostained for smooth muscle actin (SMA), then imaged by confocal microscopy for SMA (blue), tdTomato (red), and DAPI (white) for nuclei."
