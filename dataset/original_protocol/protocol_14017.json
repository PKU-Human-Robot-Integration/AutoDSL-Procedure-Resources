    "1. Preparation of plant materials\nFreeze dry plant items that were collected fresh using a lyophilizer.\n\t\nTo protect samples from light, cover chambers with aluminum foil during drying process.\nTo ensure that samples are completely dry, lyophilize until chambers no longer feel cold to touch and plant materials no longer lose mass when weighed.\nStore dried plants in sterile low residue bags in absence of light until grinding.\nFinely grind samples using a grinding mill with 0.85 mm mesh screen.\n\t\nStore the ground samples in the bags in the absence of light until extraction.\n2. Extraction of plant secondary metabolites\nTo extract the secondary plant metabolites, use a ratio of 1 g of dried sample to 10 mL of HPLC grade methanol.\n\t\nWeigh sample on an analytical balance and add it to an appropriately sized Erlenmeyer flask (125 – 250 mL). Then add appropriate volume of methanol. Record the mass of sample extracted.\nCover the plant-methanol solution with aluminum foil, and then set to rotate at 100 rpm speed at room temperature (RT) for 3 days on an orbital shaker, allowing the potentially estrogenic compounds to dissolve into the methanol.\nDecant the supernatant into a drip filtration system using filter paper (125 mm).\nUsing a rotary evaporator, dry the plant extract until the sample is thickened, but pourable, in a 300 mL round-bottom flask. Pour sample into a 50 mL round-bottom flask, rinsing the large flask with a small amount of methanol. Continue to dry the sample in the small flask until the methanol is completely evaporated.\nWeigh the sample residue using an analytical balance. Record residue mass.\nDissolve the plant extract in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 0.1 g of extract to 2 mL of DMSO. Vortex until homogenized.",
    "Store the plant extract-DMSO solution at 4 °C in amber glass vials until the assay.\nCAUTION: Plants can produce unknown biologically active chemicals, and DMSO is a vehicle that can transport them across cell membranes. Use appropriate personal protective equipment and care when handling these samples.\n3. Human estrogen receptor β transfection assay12\nNOTE: Aseptic technique and a laminar flow hood is required for Day 1 of the assay protocol.\nPrepare dilutions of 17β-Estradiol for the standard curve.\n\t\nTransfer the Cell Recovery Medium and Compound Screening Medium (CSM) from the freezer storage and thaw in a 37 °C water bath.\nLabel microcentrifuge tubes Intermediate 1 and 2 (INT1, INT2) and 1-8.\nFill INT1 with 995 μL of CSM, INT2 with 615 μL of CSM, tube 1 with 900 μL of CSM, and tubes 2-8 with 600 μL of CSM. Set tube 8 aside.\nTransfer 5 μL of 100 μM 17β-Estradiol Stock into INT1. Discard the tip. Vortex.\nBefore each transfer, rinse pipette 3 times, and then transfer 10 μL from INT1 into INT2. Discard the tip.\nRinse pipette 3 times, and then transfer 100 μL from INT2 into tube 1. Discard tip. Transfer 300 μL from tube 1 into tube 2. Repeat for tubes 3 through 7. Discard 300 μL from tube 7 into waste container. Tube 8 is a Zero and does not receive estradiol. Final concentrations of plated standards are: 400, 133.3, 44.44, 14.815, 4.938, 1.646, 0.5487, and 0 pM estradiol.\nPrepare sample compounds.\n\t\nVortex samples.\nTake 4 μL of each plant sample in DMSO and add to 496 μL of CSM to yield a 0.8% DMSO solution.\nRapidly thaw Reporter Cells.\n\t\nRetrieve the tube of Cell Recovery Medium from the 37 °C water bath. Disinfect the outside surface using 70% ethanol.",
    "Retrieve Reporter Cells from -80 °C storage and thaw by transferring 10 mL of the pre-warmed CRM into the tube of frozen cells.\nClose the tube of Reporter Cells and transfer to a 37°C water bath for 5-10 min.\nRetrieve the tube of Reporter Cell Suspension from the water bath. Invert the tube of cells several times gently to break up aggregates of cells and produce a homogenous suspension. Clean the surface of the tube with 70% ethanol.\nAssay plating\n\t\nDispense 100 μL of the Reporter Cell Suspension into each well using a multichannel pipette.\nDispense 100 μL of samples in triplicate into appropriate assay wells.\nTransfer the plate into a 37 °C, humidified 5% CO2 incubator for 22-24 h.\nThaw Detection Substrate and Detection Buffer in a dark refrigerator overnight to prepare for Day 2.\nJust prior to the end of the plate incubation, remove Detection Substrate and Detection Buffer from refrigerator and place in low light area until equilibrated to RT. Once at RT, invert each tube gently several times to thoroughly mix solutions.\n\t\nImmediately before the incubation is complete, pour the entire contents of the Detection Buffer into the tube of Detection Substrate to create Luciferase Detection Reagent. Mix gently so as not to produce foam.\nOnce the incubation is complete, invert the plate to discard content into an appropriate waste container. Gently tap the plate on a clean absorbent paper towel to remove the last droplets from the wells.\nAdd 100 μL of the Luciferase Detection Reagent to each well. Allow the assay plate to rest at RT for 15 min. Do not shake the plate.\nQuantify luminescence using a 96-well plate-reading luminometer.\nSubscription Required.
