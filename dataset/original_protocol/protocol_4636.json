    "StandardMake KDO standard 200 μg/ml stock (in water) and use 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 μl for standards (Figure 1). Use ultra pure water to make up the volume to 50 μl.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20151220/20151220230135_5459.jpgFigure 1. Standard curve for KDO estimation. Standard graph showing OD548 values obtained with various amounts of KDO. Approximately 36 μg of KDO corresponds to OD548 of 1.0. Y is the slope and R2 is the correlation coefficient of this standard curve.Sample preparationPreparation of crude cell lysates: Grow bacterial strain(s) of interest in 2 ml LB (Luria-Bertani broth) overnight at the desired temperature. Next morning, subculture 1:100 into 25 ml LB and grow until appropriate optical density is reached. For example: We have grown MG1655 (wild-type) and a mutant derivative known to make low LPS (MG1655 lpxC1272) to measure KDO. They were grown in 2 ml LB at 37 °C overnight. Next day subcultured 1:100 dilution into 25 ml LB and grown at 37 °C till an OD600 of 1.0.Pellet down cells by centrifuging at 10,000 rpm/9,391 rcf for 10 min at 4 °C.Wash the pellet with 1 ml of 10 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) and again resuspend in 1 ml of same buffer. Sonicate cells on ice for 5 min with 10 sec on and 10 sec off at 40% amplitude. Spin at 12,000 rpm/13,362 rcf for 10 min at 4 °C to remove unbroken cells. Transfer supernatant to a fresh microcentrifuge tube and store on ice. Quantify the concentration of protein. Note: Although the cell lysates are stable on ice for 24 h, in most of our experiments we used them within 6-8 h of preparation. We used Quick start Bradford reagent for estimating the protein concentration of the cell lysates. The protein concentration is used to normalize KDO.",
    "Samples with protein concentration range from 8 to 20 mg/ml work well. Normally, with these volumes, we have obtained approximately 10 mg/ml protein. AssayTo 50 µl of the above cell lysate (sample), add 50 µl of 0.5 N H2SO4 and vortex.Heat at 100 °C for 15 min for total hydrolysis of LPS. Cool to room temperature. Note: Heating is not required for KDO standards; for different Gram-negative bacteria, the time taken for hydrolysis should be standardized.Add 50 µl periodate reagent (H5IO6), vortex and let it stand for 10 min at room temperature.Add 200 µl sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) reagent and vortex until the brown color disappears (Figure 2 A).Add 800 µl thiobarbituric acid reagent and vortex. Heat at 100 °C for 15 min.Add 1 ml DMSO to each sample (Figure 2B) when it is warm to make the sample clear and also to stabilize the chromophore.Cool and measure absorbance at 548 nm on a spectrophotometer (Figure 2C).Calculate the KDO values based on the standard graph (Figure 1). Normalize the values with protein concentrations.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20151220/20151220230224_7328.jpgFigure 2. Depiction of steps B4, 7-8 in the KDO determination assay. A. Step 4: The assay mixture turns brown immediately after the addition of sodium arsenite (tube 1) and the color disappears after vortexing (tube 2). B. Step 7: After heating at 100 °C for 15 min, the samples turn pink/red depending on the amount of KDO. Tubes 1 and 2 are blank duplicates; 3 and 4 are duplicates each containing approximately 500 μg of total protein (50 μl from the cell lysate having a concentration of 10 mg/ml protein); 5 and 6 are duplicates each containing 250 μg of total protein and; 7 and 8 are duplicates each containing 100 μg of total protein.
