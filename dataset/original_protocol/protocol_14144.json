    "The protocol outlined below follows the guidelines of the Cleveland Clinic human research ethics committee.\n1. Administering the C3 App\nAdminister the C3 app to all student-athletes at baseline prior to the start of the given athletic season. Administer follow up assessments in the event of a concussive injury. Follow up assessments are reserved for the evaluation of recovery once the individual reports no more than minimal symptoms, so as to prevent symptom provocation as a result of testing. The following protocol is used when administering the C3 app.\nAssess postural sway during performance of the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) using the inertial sensors native to the digital tablet to collect biomechanical data measuring linear and angular acceleration while the student-athlete completes six 20-second balance stances.\nEnsure that the volume is turned up. Ask the athlete to remove his/her shoes.\nAsk and record the following information:\n\t\n\"If you were to kick a ball, what leg would you use?\". Record individual's answer as their \"dominant foot\".\n“Have you had an ankle or knee injury from which you haven't fully recovered in the last six months?” Record if injury affected dominant or non-dominant ankle or knee.\nRecord if the athlete is wearing any sort of brace on his/her dominant or non-dominant knee or ankle.\nRecord the surface on which the testing is being conducted.\nRecord the footwear used for testing (socks are preferred).\nAffix digital tablet onto individual's sacrum using a custom belt.",
    "Inform athlete that his/her balance will be tested. Instruct athlete to remain in the designated stance for the entire 20-second trial with his/her hands on hips and eyes closed. Instruct the athlete to get back into the correct position as quickly as possible if he/she loses his/her balance. Verify that the athlete understands the instructions, and ask him/her to stand with his/her feet together (demonstrate double limb stance, Figure 2a).\n\t\nOnce the athlete is in the proper stance, tap Start to begin the 5-second countdown that signalizes the start of the 20-second trial.\nDuring the 20-second trial, count the number of errors committed. Errors include any of the following: Hands off hips; opening eyes; step, stumble, or fall; lifting toe or heel off the ground; bending more than 30 degrees at the waist; staying out of position for greater than 5 seconds.\nRecord the number of errors committed during the balance trial.\nFor the second trial, instruct athlete to stand on his/her non-dominant foot (Figure 2b). Repeat steps 1.4.1 to 1.4.3.\nFor the third trial, instruct athlete to stand heel to toe in tandem stance, with the non-dominant foot in the back (Figure 2c). Repeat steps 1.4.1 to 1.4.3.\nFor the fourth trial, instruct athlete to stand with feet together, identical to the first stance, but on a foam pad, (Figure 2d). Repeat steps 1.4.1 to 1.4.3.\nFor the fifth trial, instruct athlete to stand on his/her non-dominant foot, identical to the second trial, but on a foam pad (Figure 2e). Repeat steps 2.4.1 to 2.4.3.\nFor the sixth trial, instruct athlete to stand stand heel to toe in tandem stance identical to the third trial, but on a foam pad (Figure 2f). Repeat steps 2.4.1 to 2.4.3.\n2. Assessment of Static and Dynamic Vision\nStatic Vision",
    "Use the length of the belt to measure 5 feet to position the digital tablet and participant at the correct distance, 5 feet apart.\nHolding the digital tablet at eye level, instruct the participant to read the 5 letters displayed from left to right (refer to instructions as shown in Figure 3).\nRecord the correct number of letters the participant was able to read.\nIf the participant correctly identified 3 or more letters, repeat steps 2.1.2 and 2.1.3 once smaller optotypes are presented.\nIf the participant identifies 2 or fewer correctly, proceed to step 2.2.\nDynamic Vision\n\t\nPlay the sample metronome tone and demonstrate proper head movement, rotating right to left, approximately 20 degrees of cervical rotation in each direction (envisioning movement from 10 to 2 on a horizontal clock dial). Ask the participant to demonstrate the proper head rotation, keeping with the metronome.\nInitiate trial, ensure participant is rotating head properly while optotypes are presented. Instruct participant to read the 5 letters displayed from left to right while continuing to rotate head left to right to the beat of the metronome. If the participant stops moving his/her head to read the letters, press Redo Trial.\nRecord the correct number of letters the participant was able to read.\nIf the participant correctly identified 3 or more letters, repeat steps 2.2.2 and 2.2.3 once smaller optotypes are presented.\nIf the participant identifies 2 or fewer correctly, proceed to next module.\n3. Assessment of Information Processing Assessment using Simple and Choice Reaction Time Paradigms14\nSimple Reaction Time (SRT) (Figure 4a)",
    "Display the instruction screen and instruct the participant to place his/her index finger from the dominant hand on the Touch and Hold button. Once the stimulus (light) turns from yellow to green, instruct the participant to release the button and touch the green light as quickly as possible.\nObserve the participant complete the practice trial, ensuring that he/she understands the directions and is able to complete the task within the allotted time (100-500 ms).\nObserve the participant complete 25 valid trials without errors within the allotted time (100-500 ms per trial).\nChoice Reaction Time (CRT) (Figure 4b)\n\t\nDisplay the instruction screen and ask participant to place both index fingers on Touch and Hold buttons.\nAfter the yellow light is displayed momentarily, a green light (stimulus) and cyan light, serving as a distractor light, are displayed. Ask participant to lift the digit that corresponds with the side in which the green light was presented, and tap the green light as quickly as possible. Remind the participant to keep the digit that corresponds to the cyan distractor light on the Touch and Hold button.\nObserve the participant complete practice trial, ensuring that he/she understands the directions and is able to complete task within the allotted time (100-750 ms).\nObserve the participant complete 25 valid trials without errors within the allotted time (100-750* ms per trial).\n\t\tNOTE: The 500 ms and 750 ms restrictions for SRT and CRT, respectively are lifted post-injury for follow up assessments.\n4. Processing Speed Test15",
    "Initiate the test and instruct the participant to read the instructions provided on the sample testing screen. Instruct the participant to use the symbol key on the top of the screen to complete the test below the symbol key. The symbol key contains symbols in the top row and corresponding digits in the bottom row. The test contains only symbols, requiring the participant to input digits that correspond to the symbol as identified in the key using the keyboard at the bottom of the screen.\nPress the Begin Practice button and observe the participant complete the practice trial according to proper testing procedures.\nRemind participant that the actual test will not provide feedback as to whether the response was “correct” or “incorrect”, as it did in the practice trial.\nInform the participant that a new row of symbols will appear once he/she completes the existing row. Instruct the participant to continue to enter corresponding digits until prompted to stop and that the trial will last 2 minutes. Remind the participant that he/she cannot correct an incorrect response, and to complete each response as quickly and accurately as possible.\nPress the Begin Test button to initiate the test. Observe the participant perform the test ensuring correct procedures are followed (Figure 5).\n5. Assessment of Executive Function and Set Switching\nTrail Making Test A\n\t\nInstruct participant to read the instructions on the screen, describing the test as a “connect the dots” test in which 25 circles corresponding with digits 1-25 must be connected by using the stylus provided (Figure 6a).\nPress Begin Practice and observe participant completing the practice trial, ensuring that he/she maintains contact between the digital tablet and stylus throughout the trial.",
    "Proceed to test by pressing the Begin Test button. Observe the participant complete the test, ensuring that correct procedures are followed (Figure 6b).\nTrail Making Test B\n\t\nInstruct participant to read the instructions on the screen, describing the test as a “connect the dots” test in which 25 circles corresponding with digits and letters must be connected using the stylus provided. Instruct the participant to begin with the number “1”, followed by the letter “A”, and continue alternating between numbers and letters, in sequence, “1” followed by “A”, then “2” followed by “B”, then “3” followed by “C”, etc. The test is complete when 25 dots corresponding with numbers and letters are connected.\nPress Begin Practice and observe participant completing the practice trial, ensuring that he/she maintains contact between the digital tablet and stylus throughout the trial (Figure 6c).\nProceed to test by pressing Begin Test button. Observe the participant complete the test, ensuring that correct procedures are followed (Figure 6d).\n6. Interpretation of C3 App to Guide Clinical Decision-Making\nAdminister C3 app follow-up assessment if the student-athlete is diagnosed with a concussion20 using procedures outlined in step 1 above. Ensure clearance of cervical spine prior to administration of dynamic visual testing.\nView follow-up performance on all C3 app modules as displayed in Figure 7.\nDetermine post-injury performance on radar plot by analyzing each axis (representing a given module) relative to baseline performance, represented by the perimeter of the polygon. The red, yellow, and blue polygons depict performance at various post-injury time points, representing a gradual return to baseline function.\nBased on the clinical exam, performance on C3 app modules, time since injury, athlete’s history, and other relevant determinants of care, refer to specialty services as outlined in carepath algorithm (Figure 1).\nField Validation",
    "Conduct an analysis of C3 app data on a cohort of student-athletes with confirmed concussion. With Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board approval and waived consent, C3 app data were obtained for all incident reports completed between July, 2014 through October, 2016, and C3 baseline and follow up assessments completed on student-athletes injured between July, 2013 through December, 2014. Criteria for inclusion were as follows: 1) Presence of baseline C3 assessment, 2) Concussive injury confirmed by Cleveland Clinic physician, 3) Follow-up C3 assessment post-injury.\nDetermine post-injury performance on each module of the C3 app by comparing outcomes to baseline performance.\n\t\t\nAnalyze data as a function of post-injury phase as defined by the carepath: acute (0-7 days post-injury), subacute (8-20 days post-injury), chronic (>20 days post-injury).\nStratify student-athletes according to time to recovery (recovered within 3 weeks of injury or recovered in >3 weeks since injury).\nSubscription Required.
