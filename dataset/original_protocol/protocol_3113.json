Under a stereomicroscope, cut off the ovary and the oviduct using spring scissors.\nBlastocysts collection.\nFill a syringe with a prewarmed M2 medium and attach the needle.\nPlace the needle into the uterine horn and flush the lumen with M2 medium at least 3 times.\nFlush also the connection between the uterus and the oviduct to ensure that all embryos are released.\nCollect and transfer the blastocysts into a 4-well plate filled with prewarmed M2 medium using mouth pipetting (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). Keep the embryos at 37°C.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2886-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "Timing: 10 min\nIn this step, the glycoprotein envelope of the embryo is removed via brief exposure to Tyrode’s solution.\nTyrode’s solution and M2 medium setup.\nInvert the lid of a 35 mm dish and place 30 μL drops of prewarmed Tyrode’s solution and 30 μL drops of prewarmed M2 medium.\nTransfer small groups of 10–20 embryos from the 4-well plate into a drop of M2 medium (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nRemoval of Zona pellucida via brief exposure to Tyrode’s solution.\nRemove the remaining medium from the mouth pipette and aspirate Tyrode’s solution. Transfer the embryos into Tyrode’s solution drop.\nExpunge the remaining liquid and refill the pipette with fresh Tyrode’s solution.\nTransfer the embryos into the second drop of Tyrode’s solution.\nRepeat this one more time and observe the quick disappearance of Zona pellucida (within 30 s) in the third drop of Tyrode’s solution (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2886-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. 3D culture of mouse embryos in PEG and DexMA hydrogels\n(A) Blastocyst stage embryos without Zona pellucida (top panel) and with intact Zona pellucida (bottom panel).

    "Critical: Zona pellucida has to be removed completely. Observe carefully the embryos, and if a thin layer of Zona pellucida remains, repeat steps 4 to 6. As an alternative approach for Zona pellucida removal, the E3.5 blastocysts can be cultured in an IVC1 medium for 24 h allowing the embryos to hatch naturally. Only the Zone-free embryos can be then used for the 3D culture.\nEmbryo culture\nTiming: 3–4 days\nThis step describes the embryo culture and trophoblast invasion in the synthetic hydrogels.\nEmbryo culture in IVC1 medium.\nPipette 1 mL of IVC1 medium into each well of a 4-well plate.\nPlace the plate into a humidified incubator with an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37°C for 30 min for pH and temperature equilibration.\nTransfer the embryos from the M2 medium to the IVC1 medium (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C) and culture the blastocysts for 16–20 h in a humidified incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nCritical: Do not culture the embryos for more than 24 h in the 4-well plate, as the blastocysts may start to attach to the surface of the plate.\nPrepare PEG or DexMA hydrogel solution as described in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]. Pipette 10 μL of the solution into the inner well of the μ-slide 3D (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nCritical: The optical plastic at the bottom of the μ-slide is very thin and prone to cracking due to temperature differences between the slide and the microscope stage. To avoid the formation of cracks, pace the μ-slide in a 10 cm tissue culture plate.\nEmbryo embedding in synthetic hydrogels.\nTransfer 5–10 blastocysts into the PEG/DexMA hydrogel solution.\nPlace the embryos at an equal distance from each other. Maintain the embryos in the middle of the hydrogel depth by sequential mouth pipetting while the PEG/DexMA solution gradually increases its viscosity.",
    "Within approximately 5 min the position of the embryos should remain fixed as the gel polymerizes (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nCritical: Transfer of the embryos from the IVC1 medium to the hydrogel solution using as little medium as possible to avoid diluting the hydrogel solution.\nCritical: The blastocysts should be completely embedded in the hydrogel. If the embryos reach the bottom of the plate they will flatten, forming an outgrowth that spreads on the plastic surface. To avoid this the embryos can be placed in the hydrogel at the third minute after pipetting the hydrogel, letting them sink and adjusting their position at the fourth minute.\nAfter positioning the embryos, place the μ-slide in a humidified incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 15 min (PEG) or at room temperature in a humidified chamber (100 mm Petri dish containing wet paper to the side) for 30 min (DexMA) allowing the hydrogel to polymerize completely.\nCritical: Note: DexMA hydrogel formation through Michael-type addition may occur very fast due to the high efficiency of the reaction. If more time for embryo positioning is required, cooling the precursor solution prior to NaOH addition slows down the process.\nPipette 40 μL of IVC2 medium to the upper chamber of the well (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F) and add 10 μL mineral oil to prevent evaporation of the medium (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G). Culture the embryos in a humidified incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nCritical: Before adding the IVC2 medium to the μ-slide, equilibrate the temperature and pH of the IVC2 medium at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 30 min.\nObserve the embryo development. By the end of day 1, the mural region of the TE should thicken, and on day 2 the trophoblast should start invading the surrounding environment (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nCo-culture of embryos and endothelial cells in a microfluidic device",
    "The 3D biomimetic platform also supports the co-culture of embryos and somatic cells, thus providing a model system for studying embryo-maternal interactions. As an example, in steps 13–27 of the protocol, we describe a setup for co-culturing embryos and endothelial cells.\nSuperovulation, blastocyst isolation and removal of Zona pellucida\nTiming: 48 h for the superovulation procedure, 30 min for the isolation of the E3.5 blastocysts and 10 min for the removal of Zona pellucida.\nIsolate blastocysts from superovulated females and remove Zona pellucida following steps 1–6.\nEmbryo positioning and culture\nTiming: 16–20 h for embryo culture in IVC1, 45 min for positioning embryos in the hydrogel and 16 h culture in IVC2 medium.\nIn this step, the embryos are positioned in the synthetic hydrogel inside of a microfluidic chip.\nFollowing the instructions of step 7, culture the embryos in IVC1 medium for 16–20 h in a 4-well plate.\nPrepare the DexMA hydrogel following the instructions in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]. Assemble the microfluidic device as described in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment].\nCritical: Once the device and the gelatin-coated needles are put together, the microfluidic chip should be stored at 4°C to prevent the melting of the gelatin coating.\nEmbryo seeding in the reservoir containing DexMA hydrogel.\nPipette 65 μL of the DexMA hydrogel solution into the middle reservoir of the device (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2886-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Schematic representation of the co-culture setup of embryos and endothelial cells in the microfluidic device\n(A–F) (A) Placement of the DexMA hydrogel into the microfluidic device; (B) Positioning of the embryos in close proximity to the channels; (C) Filling the reservoirs with IVC2 medium; (D) Removal of the needles; (E) Seeding of the endothelial cells; (F) Embryo – endothelial cells co-culture.",
    "Following step 9 of the main PROCEDURE, transfer 5–7 embryos into the hydrogel. Position the embryos in close proximity of 100–150 μm to the channel.\nMaintain the position of the embryos for approximately 5 min by mouth pipetting, while the hydrogel polymerizes (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nCritical: As the hydrogel solidifies quickly, collect the embryos from the IVC1 medium in the mouth pipette, just before adding NaOH to the hydrogel solution that initiates polymerization.\nCritical: Place the embryos in close proximity to the channel (100–150 μm) so the trophoblast and the endothelial cells are not too far apart to interact.\nAfter positioning the embryos:\nPlace the device in a humidified chamber (100 mm Petri dish containing wet paper to the side) at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 30 min allowing the hydrogel to polymerize completely.\nAdd 500 μL of IVC2 medium on top of the device covering the hydrogel chamber and the 4 reservoirs (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C, 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A, and 4B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2886-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Microfluidic device\n(A‒C) Photographs of the microfluidic device before (A and B) and after (C) removal of the needles.\nPlace the device (in a 100 mm Petri dish containing wet paper to the side) in a humidified incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2 and incubate overnight.\nSeeding of endothelial cells and co-culture with mouse embryos\nTiming: approximately 5–6 h for the seeding of endothelial cells and approximately 3 days for the embryo-endothelial cell co-culture.\nThis step describes the seeding of the endothelial cells in the channels of the microfluidic device for co-culture with the embryos.\nPlace the device in a tissue culture hood and carefully pull the needles out using forceps (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A–4C).",
    "Critical: Pull the needles out slowly using forceps. While pulling, hold the device using another forceps and keep the pulling direction straight to prevent damaging the channels by the tip of the needle.\nCritical: Before pulling the needles out, ensure that the reservoirs of the device are filled with IVC2 medium and that there is also some medium on top of the device. As the needles are pulled out, the medium flows from the reservoirs into the channels. At the same time, the reservoirs are refilled by medium on top of the device.\nSeal the open ends where the needles were inserted using vacuum grease to prevent medium leakage from the reservoirs.\nRemoval of the excess medium.\nCarefully remove any excess medium from the surface of the sealed device.\nUsing filter paper, absorb any traces of medium from the bottom surface of the device.\nPlace the device on a 100 mm plate coated with PDMS (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) and ensure that the device has well adhered to the PDMS.\nWashing of the channels.\nWash the channels, as hydrogel or gelatin debris can cause clogging.\nFor each channel, aspirate most of the medium from the channel and the reservoirs. Add fresh medium to one of the reservoirs and let the medium flow through the channel to the reservoir on the other side.\nRepeat this procedure one more time.\nCritical: Do not remove the medium completely from the reservoirs, as this may deplete the fluid in the channel causing the channel surfaces to stick and close.\nPrepare bEnd5 cell culture as described in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]. Dissociate the cells using trypsin and resuspend the pellet in IVC2 medium at a concentration of 10 × 106 cells/mL.",
    "Critical: Using this specific concentration of cells is important to prevent over- or under-population of the channels with endothelial cells.\nSeeding of the endothelial cells.\nAspirate approximately ¾ of the medium from the reservoirs and pipette 80 μL of the endothelial cell suspension into one of the reservoirs of each channel (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nObserve the endothelial cells flowing through the channels into the opposing reservoir to monitor the cell seeding. Once the cells pass through the channel, add 80 μL of cell suspension into each reservoir.\nIncubate the device at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 90 min. The cells will settle to the bottom half of the channel wall by gravity.\nAspirate approximately ¾ of the endothelial cell suspension from the reservoirs and add fresh cell suspension, repeating step 11. However, this time invert the dish with the attached device so that the cells settle by gravity and adhere to the opposite half of the channel wall during the 90 min incubation.\nWashing the channels containing endothelial cells.\nRemove approximately ¾ of the medium containing the endothelial cells from the reservoirs and add fresh IVC2 medium.\nIncubate the device for 30 min at 37°C, 5% CO2. The endothelial cells that are not in the channels settle to the bottom of the reservoirs.\nAfter the 30 min incubation, scrape off the layer of endothelial cells in the reservoirs using a P10 pipette tip.\nRemove the medium containing the scraped cells.\nAdd fresh medium to the reservoirs and let the medium flow through the channels to wash unattached endothelial cells. Repeat this one more time to remove any unattached endothelial cells from the channels and the reservoirs.\nCritical: Do not remove the medium completely from the reservoirs, as this may deplete the fluid in the channels causing them to close.",
    "Add fresh IVC2 medium to the reservoirs and place the PDMS-coated plate containing the device on a rocker inside a cell culture incubator (BenchRocker, 30° tilt angle and 12 rpm rocking speed). Incubate the device on the rocker at 37°C, 5% CO2 overnight and add fresh medium in the morning.\nCritical: Place wet paper on the side of the Petri dish to prevent medium evaporation.\nEmbryo–endothelial cells co-culture.\nOn the next day, the endothelial cells and the embryos can be co-cultured in an incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2 for the next 3 days, and the medium should be exchanged every 36 h.\nAlternatively, the device can be placed on a heated microscope stage, inside an environmental chamber at 37°C, 5% CO2 for live imaging.\nThe first interactions between the invasive trophoblast and the endothelial cell sprouts can be observed in the next 15–36 h (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2886-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Co-culture of embryos and endothelial cells in the microfluidic device\nSnapshot images of time-lapse microscopy of Lifeact-GFP embryo and tdTomato-expressing endothelial cells co-cultured in the microfluidic device. Arrowheads indicated cell-cell contacts between the trophoblast and the endothelial cells. The imaging was performed using an Andor Dragonfly spinning disc confocal microscope equipped with an sCMOS camera using 525 nm and 620 nm excitation lasers with 2%–5% laser power. The images were captured every 1 h, with an optical slice distance of 1.5 μm, using 10× CFI P-Apo Lambda objective. Scale bars, 100 μm."
