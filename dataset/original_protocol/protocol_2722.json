    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nFixation and permeabilization\nTiming: 10–30 min\nIdeally, fixation should immobilize targeted antigens, but not disturb the cell structure.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] Here, we propose 2 options. Our main protocol proposes to fix and permeabilize at the same time for gain of time. Our second option uses TCA and proposes to fix then permeabilize. Most antibodies work well with simultaneous formaldehyde fixation/permeabilization.\nNote: If the simultaneous protocol does not work well, try to separate fixation and permeabilization. If this does not work well, try with a different fixative (0.2% glutaraldehyde, ice cold TCA or ice cold methanol).\nDelicately remove the media from the well using a pipette at the corner of the well.\nNote: Remove the media and at the same time add the fixation/permeabilization solution (130 μL per well).\nIncubate the cells in the solution for 10 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nNote: To preserve better osmolarity, fixative and permeabilization solution can be prepared in PHEM buffer. Prepare fresh fixation/permeabilization solution each time you are doing the experiment.\nAlternative: For the 2-steps protocol use 10% ice cold TCA as a fixative. Fix cells for 20 min at 4°C.\nWash the fixative by rinsing the cells with PBS one time.\nAlternative: For the 2-steps protocol rinse the cells with DPBS three times for 5 min. Permeabilize the cells by incubating them in 0.5% TritonTM-X for 5 min. Rinse with DPBS (optional).\nCritical: This step should be done as fast as possible to prevent tissue or cell deformations. However, all rinses should be done carefully so the cells are not washed away from the well.",
    "Pause point: If needed, it is possible to pause after washing the fixative for up to 10 days. In that case, always rinse the cells three times for 5 min with PBS, wrap with stretch film to seal and store at 4°C.\nTroubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]. (see below).\nBlocking\nTiming: 15 min\nThe blocking step helps minimizing any unspecific antibody binding within the cell.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nIncubate cells with 200 μL 5% milk (blocking solution) for 15 min at room temperature.\nAlternative: For NuMA visualization incubate cells with 200 μL 3% BSA (alternative blocking solution) for 15 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nPrimary antibody\nTiming: 2 h\nTo visualize the proteins of interest, use a specific antibody. You can use multiple primary antibodies in the same experiment. If using multiple primary antibodies, make sure that they originate from different species to avoid cross-reactivity when using secondary antibodies to visualize the proteins.\nPrepare the antibody solution by diluting the primary antibodies in the blocking solution.\nNote: As a starting point, we find that most of the antibodies give a good result at a 1:200 ratio (1 μL of antibody can be diluted in 200 μL of the blocking solution). However, you can follow the instructions given for a specific antibody.\nIncubate 130 μL of primary antibody solution for 2 h at room temperature (20°C–25°C) on a shaker at 20 rpm.\nNote: No humid chamber is needed. If needed, the primary antibodies can be incubated overnight (16 h) at 4°C.\nTroubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]. (see below).\nBlocking\nTiming: 15 min\nWash the primary antibody by rinsing the cells 3x with 200 μL DPBS.\nIncubate cells with 200 μL of the chosen blocking solution for 15 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nSecondary antibody\nTiming: 1 h",
    "The secondary antibodies should be specific to the species of the primary antibodies and have conjugated fluorophores in the wavelengths of interest. You can mix the secondary antibodies.\nPrepare antibody solution by diluting secondary antibody in blocking solution.\nNote: As a starting point, we find that most of the antibodies give a good result at a 1:500 ratio (1 μL of antibody can be diluted in 500 μL of the blocking solution). However, you can follow the instructions given for a specific antibody.\nIncubate with 130 μL of the secondary antibody solution for 1 h at room temperature (20°C–25°C) on a shaker at 20 rpm.\nAlternative: Phalloidin can be used to label actin at a 1:200 ratio and can be mixed with secondary antibodies.\nNote: Depending on the microscope used for visualization, you can use multiple different secondary antibodies. This depends on the laser separation of your microscope. We recommend using a simple confocal microscope with a good spectral separation.\nTroubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nDNA labeling\nTiming: 10 min\nIf needed, the DNA can be stained as the final step of this protocol using Hoechst (1:10000) or DAPI (0.1 μg/mL).\nWash the secondary antibody by rinsing the cells 3x with DPBS.\nPrepare Hoechst solution by mixing 0.5 μL of Hoechst and 5 mL of DPBS (1:10000).\nIncubate cells with prepared Hoechst solution for 10 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nWash the Hoechst solution by rinsing the cells 3x with DPBS.",
    "Leave the cells in DPBS 4°C. before imaging so the cells do not dry. For the best quality image cells within a few days (up to a week) of finishing this protocol.
