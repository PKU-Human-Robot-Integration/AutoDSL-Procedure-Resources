Mice are injected with RetrobeadsTM one week prior to behavioral acclimation. On days 1-3, mice are acclimated to the testing room. On days 4-6, mice are handled (to reduce their anxiety) and the test mice are acclimated to the testing chamber. On day 7, mice are exposed to the behavioral paradigm for labeling and sacrificed.SurgeryNotes:For the behavioral paradigm, you will need one non-surgical mouse per cage acting as a known sentinel. In group housed males, it is recommended that the groups including the sentinel are littermates and that the housing is kept to no more than 5 mice per cage. Additional non-surgical novel sentinel mice (age-, sex-, and size- matched, also group housed) should be made available for the behavioral testing. Test mice will be injected with RetrobeadsTM 2 weeks prior to final behavioral exposure and sacrifice, which should be considered in the case of age- or disease- related studies (Figure 1). To increase labeling with RetrobeadsTM, 2 injections of small volumes (approximately 250 nl) per region are suggested. This is easily done by adding an additional site in the dorsoventral axis, determined by choosing sites equidistance from region boundaries per a standard mouse brain atlas. RetrobeadsTM can easily clog the injection needle. Be sure not to let the RetrobeadsTM sit in the needle for any longer than strictly necessary. To reduce this time, only draw up enough RetrobeadsTM per dorso-ventral axis and give test pulses regularly (where a small amount ~1 nl is dispensed). Between dorso-ventral axes, wipe the tip of the needle with alcohol wipes. Ensure the needle is not clogged before and after insertion into the brain by giving a test pulse and observing the ejection of RetrobeadsTM.",
    "If RetrobeadsTM are not ejected, the needle is clogged and will not (and may not have) deliver the necessary amount of RetrobeadsTM. The needle can be unclogged by pipetting PBS, insertion of cleaning pipes in the needle, or soaking the tip in ethanol. Allowing the needle to clog often will decrease the lifetime of the needle. Injection coordinates used in this paper are the prelimbic (PL) region of the mPFC and the lHYP. To determine injection sites, coordinates were found using the Paxinos & Franklin mouse atlas (Paxinos and Franklin, 2008), and verified with pilot studies. To pilot coordinates, black food-coloring can be injected in place of RetrobeadsTM and the brain immediately removed and cut with a razor blade. Sites can be visualized using a standard bright-field microscope. Because RetrobeadsTM injections can be difficult to master, be sure to test the injection protocol on a pilot dataset before proceeding to the remainder of the protocol. All procedures on experimental animals should be reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Aliquot RetrobeadsTM into small PCR tubes, adding one volume more than will be used to account for hub loss (250 nl x number of injection sites per mouse x # of mice + 250 nl).Insert Hamilton needle into syringe, priming with sterile saline, ensuring no bubbles are in the needle.Anesthetize mice in induction chamber using 4-5% vaporized isoflurane diluted with 100% oxygen at a constant flow rate of 2.5 L/min.Give mouse subcutaneous injection of analgesics (e.g., 2 mg/kg Ketaprofen).Shave the head of the mouse using standard clippers, sterilizing the scalp with alcohol wipes.Position the mouse in the stereotactic frame. Reduce isoflurane to ~2%, adjusting throughout the surgery as necessary.Apply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes.Subcutaneously inject mouse with analgesics and antibiotics.",
    "Using micro-scissors, make an incision in the scalp that is long enough to see both bregma and lambda.Ensure the head is leveled and straight using the arms of the stereotactic frame. Tighten ear bars to secure mouse, being careful to avoid changing the orientation of the head.Zero medio-lateral and anterio-posterior positions of the drill (attached to one arm of the stereotactic frame) at bregma.Drill holes in the skull above the injection site, being careful not to puncture brain. Injection site coordinates are generated using the Paxinos & Franklin mouse brain atlas (Paxinos and Franklin, 2008) and verified by pilot studies.Draw up enough RetrobeadsTM for the number of injections per needle insertion + 250 nl. Give a small test pulse to ensure the needle is not clogged.Zero needle at bregma, move needle to injection site medio-lateral and anterio-posterior coordinates. Lower needle into brain, expanding burr hole if necessary. Zero dorso-ventral position when the needle just enters the brain.Slowly lower the needle to 0.002 mm below the deepest injection site, wait 2 min. Give small test pulse to clear needle.Retract the needle to the first injection site, give small test pulse to keep needle clear, wait 2 min. Inject RetrobeadsTM at a speed of 250 nl per min. Wait 2 min after injection completion.Retract the needle to the most superficial injection site, give small test pulse, wait 2 min and inject RetrobeadsTM.Slowly retract the needle, over the course of 5-10 min depending on depth of injection. Give test pulse to ensure needle is not clogged. Wipe needle with ethanol wipes.Repeat injection procedure for the other hemisphere and any additional regions.After all injections are completed, drop approximately 1 ml of sterile saline on the mouse skull. Dry with sterile tissue paper.",
    "Pull the skin on sides of incision together, being careful not to fold or overlap them. Apply vet bond avoiding the eyes, nose/whiskers, and ears.Remove mouse from isoflurane, place the mouse on a paper towel in the recovery cage that is positioned so that half the cage is on a heating pad. The mouse should be placed on the heated section. One recovery cage per mouse is required, mice can be placed back in their previous social groups once they are up and walking.Check mice daily for incision opening and lethargy. Follow approved IACUC protocols for humane endpoints, if necessary.Figure 2 shows representative examples of successful retrogradely labeled neurons in ventral CA1 with projections to the mPFC and the lHYP, and immunostained for the neuronal marker NeuN and the IEG c-Fos.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200903/20200903030508_0528.jpgFigure 2. Example of successful retrobead injection. Green RetrobeadsTM were injected into the mPFC (A) and red RetrobeadsTM were injected into the lHYP (B). Minimal spread of RetrobeadsTM is observed. Two weeks following injection, neuronal cell bodies containing RetrobeadsTM can be observed in the target region, vHIP, determined by their colocalization with NeuN (C).Table 1 shows the stereotactic coordinates used to target the mPFC and the lHYP during injections of RetrobeadsTM in adult C57/Bl6 mice.Table 1. RetrobeadsTM injection coordinates. Coordinates for stereotactic injection targeting the mPFC and lHYP for labeling vHIP projection neurons (from Phillips et al., 2019).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200903/20200903030800_6111.jpgBehaviorNotes:Mice should be acclimated, handled, and tested during their most active phase (i.e., dark cycle). Timing of interactions is critical because c-Fos expression is temporally linked to behavior. A red headlamp should be worn so that the experimenter can see but without disrupting the circadian rhythm of the mice. Note excessive fighting in any of the mouse-mouse interactions, removing mice from the test group if injuries occur.",
    "Using sequential interactions, as opposed to combined, reduces aggression and enhances time spent with each mouse.One week after the RetrobeadsTM injection surgery, mice should start being acclimated to the behavior room. For the first 3 days, move the mouse cages (including any sentinel cages) to the room and let them acclimate for 2-4 h before returning them to the animal facility (Figure 1).On days 4-6, mice should be acclimated to handing and the interaction chamber. Put clean mouse bedding in the bottom of the acclimation chamber. Handle each mouse for approximately 3 min by picking them up and allowing them to sit in your hands. After 3 min, or when the mice have calmed down (whichever is longest), transfer the mice to the interaction chamber. The sentinel mice should be handled, but not moved to the interaction chamber. After 10 min of acclimation, remove the mice from the interaction chamber and return to the home cage. Remove the used bedding and replace with clean. At the end of each day, clean the interaction chamber with 70% isopropyl alcohol.On labeling day (day 7), remove sentinels from home cages and place singly in clean cages for the duration of the testing. Be sure to mark the cages well for ease in determining which mice will be the familiar and novel sentinel.Use a random number generator to separate surgical mice into 2 groups: those that will interact with other mice, and those that will interact with inanimate objects (e.g., toy mice). Be sure to fill the bottom of the interaction chamber with clean bedding before each interaction session.For test mice that will interact with other mice, place the test mouse in the interaction chamber and quickly add the familiar sentinel (cage mate).",
    "Allow to interact for 10 min before returning to respective cages (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200903/20200903030834_6639.jpgFigure 3. Schematic and Image of Labeling Day. A. Schematic of behavioral interactions on labeling day. Test mice reside in their homecage until immediately prior to interactions. One group of randomly selected mice will interact with toy mice (Object condition) while the other will interact with live mice (Social condition). Each test mouse is moved to the testing arena, immediately after which either the toy mouse or live littermate mouse is added. After 10 min of unrestricted interaction, the test mouse is returned to the home cage for 1 h. The test mouse is placed in the same, cleaned testing arena immediately joined by either a second toy mouse or live novel mouse. After 10 min of unrestricted interaction, the test mouse is returned to their home cage. The test mouse is anesthetized and perfused 45 min following the cessation of the last interaction. B. Image of behavioral set up, consisting of optional video camera (housing a long-pass filter) with infrared light positioned above the test box. In this set up, the room is equipped with red lights, but a red head lamp is also acceptable.One hour following the initial exposure, return the test mouse to the interaction chamber. Quickly add the novel sentinel (non-cage mate) and allow them to interact for 10 min.For test mice interacting with objects, place one of the fake toy mice in the corner of the interaction chamber prior to adding the test mouse. Allow to interact for 10 min before returning the test mouse to the home cage.After 1 h, place the second fake toy mouse in an alternative corner. Add the test mouse and allow to interact for 10 min before returning the test mouse to the home cage.",
    "Forty-five minutes after the last interaction, anesthetize mice using an intraperitoneal injection of anesthetic mixture and proceed to the transcardiac perfusion fixation.PerfusionPrepare 1x PBS and 4% paraformaledehyde solutions, placing both in ice baths.Assemble perfusion system and prime tubing, removing air bubbles. Make sure that the line up to the needle is clear of paraformaldehyde before beginning because perfusion should start with 1x PBS to clear the blood from all vessels. The flow rate should be approximately 4 ml/min.Forty-five min after the conclusion of the last behavioral encounter, anesthetize mice with an intraperitoneal injection of anesthetic mixture of Ketamine (100 mg/kg) and Xylazine (15 mg/kg). Ensure mouse is properly anesthetized by the absence of toe-pinch reflexes before proceeding.(Optional) Secure mouse to perfusion tray. Open the chest cavity, using a hemocytometer hold the rib cage out of the way.Slide perfusion needle into the left ventricle of the heart and secure it in place. Begin perfusion with 1x PBS, and quickly make small incision in the right atrium to allow discharge of perfusion solutions.Perfuse with 1x PBS until the perfusate is clear from blood, approximately 2 min for an adult mouse. Switch to 4% paraformaldehyde solution. Perfuse for 20 min.Dissect the brain, being careful not to create nicks in the tissue. Immerse the brain in 4% paraformaldehyde, and store at 4 °C overnight.Replace 4% paraformaldehyde with brain storage solution (see Recipe 5).Be sure to clear final perfusion line of paraformaldehyde using 1x PBS before next perfusion.SectioningSoak vibratome cutting blades in acetone for ~5 min prior to use (to remove shipping glue and oil).Cut brain with large blocking cuts using a razor blade; make sure to save injection sites for confirmation. Make straight cuts, leaving ample room for the brain to be glued to the cutting chuck.",
    "Prepare agar block in a way that the sides are cut straight and it is slightly wider and taller than the brain. Glue this side to the back of the cutting chuck using cyanoacrylate glue (e.g., Super GlueTM).Quickly remove excess brain storage solution using tissue paper, and glue brain directly in front of (closer to the blade) the agar block on the cutting chuck.Position the chuck in the vibratome, fill vibratome well with 1x PBS.Cut brain sections at 30 µm thickness for c-Fos immunohistochemistry, and 100 µm thickness for visualization of injection sites. Store serial sections in order within 12-well plates containing brain storage solution. Seal the well plates with ParafilmTM, and store at 4 °C and covered from light until staining.ImmunohistochemistryNotes: Use only 4 well inserts in each 12-well plate to make media changes easier and reduce errors. When reusing wells, suction used media from the wells, rinse with 1x PBS and suction dry. To change media, fill dry wells with the upcoming solution, and move well inserts into fresh solution. Keep well plates covered with tin foil while not changing media to prevent bleaching of RetrobeadsTM with ambient light. For best results, stain all sections from an experiment at the same time to avoid unnecessary variability from tissue processing.Place one well insert per brain inside 12-well plates. Add 2-3 ml of 1x PBS.Using a paint brush, carefully transfer five 30 µm sections per brain to the wells.Fill 1 empty well per insert with 1 ml permeabilization solution. Move the inserts from the 1x PBS to the wells containing permeabilization solution. Place well plate on a shaker for 15 min, covered with tin foil.Fill 1 empty well per insert with 1 ml blocking solution, transfer wells to the block, replace plate on shaker, cover, leave for 1 h.",
    "Prepare primary antibody solution. Mix [1.25 ml antibody diluent + 2.5 µl anti c-Fos + 2.5 µl anti NeuN] x number of wells.Fill 1 empty well per insert with 1 ml primary antibody solution, transfer inserts to well, replace plate on shaker, cover with tin foil. Leave sections on shaker for ~36 h.Fill empty wells with 2 ml 1x PBS, transfer inserts and wash for 5 min. Repeat 3 times with fresh PBS each wash.Prepare amplification antibody solution. Mix [1.25 ml antibody diluent + 6.25 µl biotinylated goat anti-guinea pig] x number of wells.Place well inserts in 1 ml of amplification solution, let amplify for 2 h.Fill empty wells with 2 ml 1x PBS, transfer inserts and wash for 5 min. Repeat 3 times with fresh PBS each wash.Prepare secondary antibody solution. Mix [1.25 ml antibody diluent + 1.25 µl streptavidin conjugated to Alexa Fluor 405 + 6.25 µl goat anti-chicken conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647] x number of wells.Place well inserts in 1 ml of secondary antibody solution, let stain for 4 h.Fill empty wells with 2 ml 1x PBS, transfer inserts and wash for 5 min. Repeat 3 times with fresh PBS each wash.Put 1 ml of 1x PBS on a microscope slide. Using a paintbrush, transfer brain sections to the slide. Carefully position and flatten sections.Using a pipette, aspirate the excess 1x PBS while repositioning the sections. Dry remaining 1x PBS with tissue paper. Cover and leave until just dry, ~5 min.Place a small drop of Vectashield mounting media over each section. Carefully position coverslip avoiding bubbles.Using clear nail polish, seal the edges of the coverslip and slide.Store in the dark at 4 °C until imaging.",
    "Confocal microscopy and image analysesNote: For quantitative immunohistochemistry, it is best practice to image all sections on the same day or immediately consecutive days to avoid unnecessary variability. It is of utmost importance that all images are taken using the exact same settings in the microscope, e.g., objective lens (especially NA), laser power, dwell time (scan rate), pinhole aperture, PMT gain and offset, distance between optical sections in z-stack, number of optical sections in each z-stack, pixel resolution, scanning area.To begin, set laser power, and PMT gain and offset so that ~75% of the range of pixel intensities is used. Be sure to check a few brain sections from each condition to ensure these settings are suitable for the entire dataset. No pixels in any image should be brighter than the maximum in any of the experimental conditions (i.e., avoid image saturation).Recommended settings include:Pinhole set to 1 Airy unit, as determined by the image acquisition software of the confocal microscope.Lower gain can be compensated by slightly increasing laser power.Use only minimal PMT offset.Use consecutive excitation of all channels through line scan (i.e., do not use simultaneous excitation to avoid spectral “bleed-through” and shifting).Use line averaging (2 should be sufficient).Use 1,024 x 1,024 pixel image size, saved at 16 bit pixel depth resolution.Z-axis interval set to optimal as determined by confocal software.Depending on the number of neurons labeled per section, determine how many images you will take per section for the desired sample number (“n”). In Phillips et al. (2019), the entire region from each section was imaged, and every RetrobeadsTM-labeled neuron analyzed. This may not be feasible in other brain regions, depending on density of labeled neurons."
