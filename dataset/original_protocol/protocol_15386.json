    "This protocol was approved by the University of Rochester committee devoted to the ethical use of animals in research (UCAR). Aseptic techniques should be followed during the protocol. The use of sterile gloves and a mask is required.\nAll the equipment, materials, chemicals, and tools that are used during the protocol are described in Table 1. \n1. Pre-surgical Preparation\nInject mice subcutaneously with buprenorphine (0.05mg/kg) 2 h before surgery, immediately after the surgery  and then every 3-5 h during the first 24 h post-operative period.\nSterilize all the surgical instruments, gauze sponges, and cotton tip applicators by autoclave. Keep surgical tools in 70% ethanol during the surgery and air dry on sterile gauze right before use. Spray the work area with 70% ethanol. \nAnesthetize the mouse with a 3% isofluorane-20% oxygen gas mixture by using an anesthetic vaporizer. Adjust the oxygen amount with the flow meter. Test the level of anesthesia by toe or tail pinching (they should be unresponsive). Maintain the level of anesthesia with 2% (v/v) isofluorane.\nApply artificial tears to the mouse’s eyes and use caution to avoid damaging the eye during the surgical procedure. Place the mouse on its right side in a lateral position.\nShave the area on the left side between the left eye and the base of the left ear using the animal clippers. Cleanse the area by alternating between a betadine solution and 70% ethanol using cotton tip applicators and lightly rubbing the area. Repeat as necessary.\nPlace the mouse on to a heating pad connected to a rectal probe to maintain body temperature at 37°C. Insert the rectal probe by using mineral oil. \nPosition the mouse on its right side under the microscope and secure with tape. Cut a window in a gauze sponge and cover surgical area.",
    "2. Surgical Procedure and MCA Ligation\nMake a vertical incision between the left eye and the base of the left ear by using fine straight scissors. Use curved hemostats to keep the surgical area open.\nMake a horizontal incision on the temporal muscle by using spring scissors and slightly separate the temporal muscle from the skull by slowly pulling with forceps. \nMake a small subtemporal craniotomy at the junction of zygomatic arch and squamosal bone by using an 18G needle while holding the jawbone with curved forceps.\nExpose the MCA by removing the small pieces of skull with bone rongeurs. The zygomatic arch and orbital contents should not be damaged during this process. If excessive drying of tissue occurs during this process, apply sterile PBS with cotton tip applicators. \nLigate the distal portion of the MCA by using a small vessel cauterizer. \n Place the temporal muscle back into its original position and close the incision site with surgical 5-0 nylon sutures. \n Discontinue anesthesia and remove the rectal probe. Inject the mouse with a 2nd dose of buprenorphine (0.05mg/kg) subcutaneously. Return the mouse to the cage which was kept at 37°C with a heating panel.\nClosely monitor the mouse for the next 24 h for any discomfort (decreased appetite/water consumption, hunched posture, increased respiration, pilo-erected hair). Inject the mouse with buprenorphine subcutaneously every 3-5 h post-surgery up to 24h. Provide the mouse with recovery gel during this period. \n3. TTC Staining and Determination of Stroke Volume",
    "Twenty-four hours after the surgery deeply anesthetize the mouse, transcardially perfuse the mouse with a 4% TTC (w/v) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min and then with a 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 10 min by using a mini peristaltic pump at medium flow rate. Remove the brain and place it into the 4% paraformaldehyde solution overnight. \n Position the brain into the sectioning block. Slice the brain into 1mm thick slices by using razor blades. \n Place the slices next to a millimeter scale ruler. Photograph the slices by using a digital camera connected to the dissecting microscope.\n Calculate the stroke area by subtracting the non-infarcted area of the ipsilateral site from the total area of the contralateral site using Image J Software (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). Calculate the stroke volume by stacking the stroke area of the slices 22.\n4. Directions to use Image J software \n Open the image file to be analyzed in Image J software by clicking on the file menu. \n Click on the ‘straight line’ tab in the program. Draw a straight line between the two margins on the ruler. Click on ‘analyze’ menu and select ‘set scale’. Set the known distance as 1, unit of length as mm.\n Click on ‘freehand circle’ tab. Draw a circle to outline the contralateral hemisphere. Click on ‘analyze’ menu and select ‘measure’. The calculation window will pop up showing the area of the circle drawn. \n Draw another circle around the ipsilateral hemisphere excluding stroke (white) area. Measure the area as indicated in step 4.3. The new value will be added to the calculation window. The difference between the 1st and 2nd values represents the area of the infarct which is indicated as A in the formula below.",
    "Calculate the stroke area in each slice by repeating steps 4.2-4.4. Take summation of the stroke area calculated in each slice (∑An). This represents stroke volume knowing the fact that the thickness of each slice is 1mm.\n∑An x 1mm (thickness of each slice) = Stroke volume\n5. Representative Results: \nThe infarcts obtained by permanent MCA ligation in the mouse are mostly cortical. However, it is possible to obtain subcortical lesions if the MCA is ligated proximal to the lenticulostriate branch. The stroke volumes after MCA ligation might vary from 10mm³ to 35mm³ 19, 23. The stroke volumes calculated with TTC staining in Moyanova et al. 19 are between 10mm³ to 22mm³  while the stroke volumes determined from MRI images in Filiano et al 23 are between 20mm³ to 35mm³.  The possible reason for these differences maybe the exact location of the ligation and the different methods used to measure the stroke volumes.\nIn Figure 1, a TTC stained brain 24 hr post permanent MCA ligation in a wild type C57/BL6 mouse is shown. The stroke site is white in appearance (Fig. 1A, B). Figure 1A and B illustrate the infarct site from different angles. Figure 2 shows  1mm thick slices of the TTC stained stroke brain from anterior to posterior (Fig. 2A-G). Infarct volume was calculated 24 h post-surgery.  The volume of the infarct is ˜23mm³. \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3039/3039fig1.jpgFigure 1. Representation of stroke site.
