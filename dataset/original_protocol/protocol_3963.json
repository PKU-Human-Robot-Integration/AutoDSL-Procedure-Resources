    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nGrowth of L. monocytogenes Bacteria – Days 1–3\nTiming: 30 min (day 1)\nNote: The protocol was developed to determine the structure of 5′ UTRs in the human bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, but could in principle be applied to any other bacterial species.\nUsing an inoculation loop, plate L. monocytogenes cells on a Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) agar plate. Grow for 16 h (overnight) in a 37°C incubator.\nTiming: 30 min (day 2)\nThe next day pick a colony and transfer it to 20 mL of BHI broth. Grow for 16 h (overnight) in a water incubator at 37°C and 150 rpm shaking.\nTiming: 3–5 h (day 3)\nThe next day transfer 0.25 mL of the overnight culture to 25 mL of prewarmed BHI medium (dilution 1:100) and grow until the mid-logarithmic growth phase at 37°C and 150 rpm shaking.\nNote: Not only BHI, but also LB broth and chemically defined media (Whiteley et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]) can be used to grow L. monocytogenes. Depending on the medium type and source, the genetic background of bacteria and equipment used to measure OD, the growth dynamics and OD values can vary considerably. Therefore, prior to the main experiment it is necessary to grow bacteria and plot the growth curves. Based on these data, optimal OD to perform dimethyl sulphate (DMS) treatment can be determined. Also, it is important to have the necessary volume of bacteria for DMS treatment to get sufficient RNA for further experiment. In this protocol we perform DMS treatment of L. monocytogenes in the mid-logarithmic growth phase (Ignatov et al, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nDMS Treatment - Day 3\nTiming: 1 h (day 3)",
    "Prewarm 15 mL tube to 37°C on the incubator. Using a prewarmed Pasteur pipette rapidly transfer 5 mL bacterial culture to the 15 mL tube.\nCritical: Do not allow the culture to cool down. Temperature is one of the main parameters affecting RNA structure. Furthermore, many bacteria possess very sensitive systems to detect temperature decrease and activate the cold shock response, which might affect the experiment results.\nUsing a 1 mL tip transfer 150 μL DMS to 5 mL of the culture (final DMS concentration 3%). Adjust the pipette sampling volume to 500 μL and using the same tip, pipette the culture up and down 10 times. Incubate the mixture for 3 min. Every 30 s pipette the mixture up and down.\nCritical: DMS and β-mercaptoethanol are highly toxic and a special protective equipment should be used when working with these chemicals. Therefore, refer to your country safety regulations when working with DMS and β-mercaptoethanol.\nNote: DMS does not dissolve in water solutions completely and without thorough mixing, DMS accumulates at the bottom of the tube.\nInactivate DMS by adding 6 mL Quenching solution and vigorously shaking the tube.\nCollect bacteria by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min at +4°C. Wash the pellet with 5 mL ice cold 30% β-mercaptoethanol solution. Pulse centrifuge and completely discard the supernatant. Immediately proceed to RNA isolation [Problem 1].\nRNA Isolation – Days 3–4\nTiming: 2–3 h (day 3)\nNote: L. monocytogenes is a Gram-positive bacterium with a thick cell wall. To isolate RNA the cell wall is disrupted by mechanical grinding followed by acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction. For other bacterial species the cell lysis protocols can be different.\nDissolve the bacterial pellet in 400 mL ice-cold Cell Disruption solution.",
    "Transfer the cell suspension to the pre-cooled 2 mL screw-cap tube containing 500 μL of 0.1 mm zirconium beads (Biospec) and 500 μL of acid phenol (pH 4.5). Keep the tubes on ice.\nCritical: Phenol, TRI reagent and Chloroform are highly toxic and a special protective equipment should be used when working with these chemicals. Therefore, refer to your country safety regulations when working with Phenol, TRI reagent and Chloroform.\nNote: It is important to keep cells at low temperature during all preparations before addition of TRI reagent. This helps to minimize the potential activity of cellular RNases.\nDisrupt the cells on a BeadBeater 8 (Biospec) cell disruptor at maximum speed for 30 s.\nAlternatives: other cell disruptors can be used instead of BeadBeater. As an example, we successfully tested Fastprep-24 (MP Biomedicals).\nCentrifuge the disrupted cells at 12,000 × g for 5 min at +4°C. Collect the upper aqueous phase and transfer to a new 2 mL tube.\nAdd 1 mL of TRI reagent solution (ThermoFisher) and vigorously shake the tube by hands. Incubate the tube on the bench for 5 min.\nAdd 200 μl of Chloroform, vigorously shake the tube by hands and incubate on ice for 5 min.\nCentrifuge the tube at 12,000 × g for 5 min at +4°C. Collect the upper aqueous phase and transfer to a new 2 mL tube. Add 500 μL of Chloroform and vigorously shake the tube by hands.\nCentrifuge the tube at 12,000 × g for 5 min at +4°C. Collect the upper aqueous phase and transfer to a new 1.5 mL tube. Add isopropanol at 0.7× volume of the aqueous phase. Mix by vortexing and incubate at −20°C for 1 h or longer.",
    "Pause Point: at this step the sample can be stored for up to one week at −20°C.\nTiming: 2 h (day 4)\nPrecipitate RNA by centrifuging the tube at 20,000 × g for 30 min at +4°C. Carefully discard the supernatant and wash the pellet with 500 μL of 80% ethanol.\nCentrifuge the tube at 20,000 × g for 5 min at +4°C and completely discard the supernatant. Dry the RNA pellet for 10 min on the bench and dissolve in 50 μl of RNase free water.\nMeasure the RNA concentration on nanodrop and check its quality on agarose gel [Problem 2][Problem 3].\nPause Point: The isolated DMS modified RNA can be stored at −20°C for a month or at −80°C for up to 6 months.\nRNA Treatment with DNase I, 5′ Polyphosphatase and Ribosomal RNA Depletion - Day 4\nTiming: 6–8 h (day 4)\nNote: Ribosomal RNA constitutes up to 90% of the RNA content in bacterial cells. Therefore, to obtain a sufficient coverage of other transcripts it is necessary to remove it.\nIn our original work we used Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (Gram-Positive Bacteria) (Illumina). However, since then the kit has been discontinued by Illumina. As a substitute we suggest riboPOOL kit (siTOOLs Biotech); RiboMinus depletion kit (K155014, Thermofisher) or Ribo-Zero Plus rRNA depletion Kit (Illumina) but none of these kits have been tested by us.\nNote: To get enough RNA for subsequent steps of library preparation we started with 10 μg of DMS-treated total RNA.\nTreat 10 μg of total RNA sample with DNase I (Roche) for 30 min at 37°C.\nPurify RNA on RNeasy MinElute (Qiagene) columns according to the protocol from the manufacturer, elute from the column with 15 μL of RNase free water.",
    "Remove γ and β phosphates from 5′-triphosphorylated RNAs by treatment with RNA 5′ polyphosphatase (Epicentre):\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_93_10.csv\nPurify RNA on RNeasy MinElute columns according to the protocol from the manufacturer, elute with 15 μL of RNase free water.\nDeplete ribosomal RNA using appropriate kit (see above). Adjust the volume of RNA solution to a final volume 20 μL with RNase free water.\nPause Point: The sample depleted of ribosomal RNA can be stored at −20°C for up to one week or at −80°C for up to one month.\nLigation of the 5′ Adaptor, Fragmentation and Size Selection – Day 5\nTiming: 10 h (day 5)\nConcentrate the RNA sample on a SpeedVac Concentrator (ThermoFisher) to 4.5 μl.\nLigate the PAGE-purified 5′ RA:\nAdd 1 μL of 15 μM PAGE-purified 5′ RA and mix the reaction mixture by pipetting.\nHeat for 3 min at 65°C in a thermocycler with hot lid and cool on ice.\nAssemble the ligation reaction:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_93_11.csv\nIncubate for 2 h at room temperature (∼23°C).\nNote: From this step of the protocol we suggest introducing a negative control sample (K-): the 5′ RA ligation reaction set up without bacterial RNA. All subsequent steps should be the same for the samples and the negative control. After purification of Illumina cDNA library, the negative control should not have any products visible on electrophoresis. This guarantees that the cDNA libraries represent the sequences of bacterial RNAs and not any artefacts.\nEthanol precipitate RNA with ligated 5′RA\nAdd 70 μL of RNase free water, 10 μL of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.0), 2 μL of GlycoBlue coprecipitant and 300 μL of 100% ethanol. Vortex and incubate for 1 h at −20°C.",
    "Precipitate RNA by centrifuging the tube at 20,000 × g for 30 min at +4°C. Carefully discard the supernatant and wash the pellet with 500 μL of 80% ethanol.\nCentrifuge the tube at 20,000 × g for 5 min at +4°C and completely discard the supernatant. Dry the RNA pellet for 10 min on the bench and dissolve in 9 μL of RNase free water.\nNote: After depletion of ribosomal RNA, the quantity of RNA decreases significantly and for ethanol precipitation it is necessary to use a coprecipitant.\nPerform RNA fragmentation with RNA fragmentation reagents (ThermoFisher):\nAdd 1 μL of the 10× Fragmentation Buffer, mix and spin briefly.\nIncubate at 70°C for 3.5 min in a thermocycler with the heating lid.\nAdd 1 μL of the Stop Solution, mix, spin briefly and place the sample on ice.\nNote: The fragmentation parameters were empirically chosen to fragment L. monocytogenes RNAs to lengths of approximately 70–350 nucleotides (nts). If using another fragmentation method or bacterial species, it is advisable to calibrate the fragmentation conditions.\nResolve RNA on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and isolate the fragments having lengths from 125 to 400 nts (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/93-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Size Selection of RNA Fragments\nThe RiboRuler Low Range RNA ladder (ThermoFisher) is shown to the left. Numbers reflect sizes in nucleotides. The area of the excised piece of gel is within the square.\nPour 6% Urea-PAA gel using plates and the 5 well 1 mm wide combs of the Mini Protean system (Biorad):\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_93_12.csv\nMix the fragmented RNA with 12 μL of 2× RNA loading dye (ThermoFisher), heat the mixture at 70°C for 10 min and chill on ice.",
    "Apply the RNA sample to the gel in parallel with the RiboRuler Low Range RNA ladder (ThermoFisher) and run until the bromophenol blue dye migrates for 3 cm.\nNote: There is no need to extensively separate the RNA-fragments on the gel. Even after a short migration time, the non-ligated adapters and abundant tRNA species will be separated from the mRNA fragments. The short migration also decreases the size of the excised fragment, thereby decreasing the gel volume and increasing the recovery efficiency.\nStain the gel with SYBR gold and visualize on a blue light transilluminator. Excise the gel fragments with the lengths between 125 and 400 nucleotides.\nNote: the 6% PAA gel is very fragile and should be treated with care.\nDisintegrate the gel fragments. With a hot needle punch ∼0.5 mm hole in the bottom of a 0.5 mL tube. Place the gel fragments in the 0.5 mL tube and insert it into a 2 mL tube. Centrifuge for 10 min at > 10 000 g.\nAdd 300 μL of 300 mM NaCl solution to the crushed gel and incubate for 2 h at 50°C and shaking at 300 rpm.\nTransfer the gel slurry to the Costar Spin-X column and centrifuge for 3 min at 10,000 × g to remove the gel pieces.\nPrecipitate RNA by adding 2 μL GlycoBlue co-precipitant and 900 μL 100% EtOH, incubating at 20°C for 1 to 16 h and spinning at 20 000 g for 30 min at 4°C.\nResuspend the purified RNA fragments in 10 μL RNase-free water.\nPause Point: This RNA sample can be stored at −20°C for a week.\nLigation of the 3′ Adaptor – Day 6\nTiming: 7 h (day 6)\nDephosphorylate the 3′ ends of RNA fragments with T4 Polynucleotide Kinase.\nSet up the following reaction:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_93_13.csv",
    "Incubate at 37°C for 30 min.\nPurify dephosphorylated RNA fragments with RNeasy MinElute Cleanup kit (Qiagen). Modify steps 1 and 2 of the protocol: to 20 μL of PNK reaction add 80 μL of RNase free water and 350 μL RLT buffer. Thoroughly mix the sample and add 550 μL of 100% ethanol. Proceed with the conventional protocol for RNeasy MinElute Cleanup kit.\nNote: the increased volume of ethanol added at the step 2 improves absorbance of RNA fragments shorter than 200 nts to the RNeasy MinElute column, preventing their loss during purification.\nConcentrate RNA sample on a SpeedVac Concentrator to 7.5 μL.\nLigate adenylated 3′DA oligo using T4 RNA Ligase 2, Truncated (NEB).\nSet up the following reaction:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_93_14.csv\nIncubate for 2 h at the room temperature (∼23°C).\nEthanol precipitate the reaction mixture:\nAdd 70 μL of RNase free water, 10 μL of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.0), 2 μL of GlycoBlue coprecipitant and 300 μL of 100% ethanol. Vortex and incubate for 1 h at −20°C.\nPrecipitate RNA by centrifuging the tube at 20,000 × g for 30 min at +4°C. Carefully discard the supernatant and wash the pellet with 500 μL of 80% ethanol.\nCentrifuge the tube at 20,000 × g for 5 min at +4°C and completely discard the supernatant. Dry the RNA pellet for 10 min on the bench and dissolve in 20 μL of RNase free water.\nRemove non-ligated 3′DA using RNAClean XP Kit. Follow the Protocol provided by the manufacturer but with the following modifications: 1) use the 1.6 × volume of magnetic beads to sample ratio (i.e. add 32 μL of beads to 20 μL of sample) 2) at the final step, elute the purified RNA from beads with 30 μL of RNase free water.",
    "Pause Point: This RNA sample can be stored at −20°C for a week.\nReverse Transcription Using TGIRTIII Enzyme – Day 7\nTiming: 5 h (day 7)\nConcentrate RNA solution on a SpeedVac Concentrator to 4.5 μL.\nPerform reverse transcription with TGIRTIII enzyme (InGex)(Mohr et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Zubradt et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]):\nMix 4.5 μL of the RNA sample with 1 μL of 1 μM RT primer and 2 μL of 5× Reverse transcription buffer. Heat for 2 min at 80°C using the thermocycler with the heated lid. Transfer the tube to the room temperature (∼23°C) and allow RT primer to anneal for 5 min.\nAdd the other components to set up the final reaction:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_93_15.csv\nNote: Use freshly prepared 0.1M dithiothreitol (DTT).\nIncubate reaction at 57°C for 2 h in a thermocycler with a heated lid.\nAdd 1 μL 5 M NaOH, pipette up and down to mix, and incubate at 95°C for 3 min.\nEthanol precipitate the synthesized first strands of cDNA:\nAdd 160 μL of RNase free water, 20 μL of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.0), 2 μL of GlycoBlue co-precipitant and 600 μL of 100% ethanol. Vortex and incubate for 1 h at −20°C.\nPrecipitate the cDNA first strands by centrifuging the tube at 20,000 × g for 30 min at +4°C. Carefully discard the supernatant and wash the pellet with 500 μL of 80% ethanol.\nCentrifuge the tube at 20,000 × g for 5 min at +4°C and completely discard the supernatant. Dry the pellet for 10 min on the bench and dissolve in 20 μL of nuclease free water.\nPause Point: The first strands of cDNA can be stored at −20°C for a week or at −80°C for longer period.\nAmplification of cDNA Libraries – Days 7–8",
    "Note: The amplification is performed by two rounds of PCR with several clean up steps to deplete the short DNA fragments, mostly represented by primers and adaptor dimers.\nNote: If you plan to sequence several DMS-MaPseq libraries with a single run on Illumina sequencing machine, carefully pick the LibAmp_RPIXX_R primers for amplification. The variable parts of these primers correspond to reverse complement of Illumina index sequences. To check the compatibility of different index adapters with each other, refer to Index Adapters Pooling Guide from Illumina.\nTiming: 4 h (day 7)\nRun the first round of PCR to amplify cDNA libraries.\nSet up the PCR reaction:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_93_16.csv\nRun the PCR reaction on a thermocycler with the heated lid:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_93_17.csv\nPurify the PCR product using AMPure XP beads. Use 1:1 volume ratio of AMPure XP beads and PCR reaction (i.e. mix 25 μL of beads with 25 μL of PCR reaction). Elute from the beads with 40 μL of nuclease-free water.\nNote: the decreased ratio of beads to samples allows to deplete not only the PCR primers, but also very short cDNA fragments and adaptor dimers.\nRun the second round of PCR to amplify cDNA libraries.\nSet up the PCR reaction:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_93_18.csv\nRun the PCR reaction on a thermocycler with the heated lid:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_93_19.csv",
    "Note: It is advisable to first calibrate the number of PCR cycles (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). The product of the second PCR should be collected at the exponential phase of amplification to minimize amplification biases. Therefore, first perform a calibrating PCR by collecting 5 μL of PCR products from different cycles (e.g. 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12) and resolve them on 1.5% agarose gel along with GeneRuler 50 bp DNA ladder (ThermoFisher). Find the optimal cycles generating sufficient product for further work, but where the concentration has not yet reached saturation. In our experience, 4 to 6 cycles of the second PCR round is sufficient to get enough cDNA for Illumina sequencing.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/93-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Amplification and Purification of Illumina cDNA Libraries\n(A) DNA fragments at different cycles of the second round of cDNA amplification. The fragments were resolved on agarose gel in parallel with GeneRuler 50 bp DNA Ladder (ThermoFisher). Samples 1 and 2 represent the biological replicates of the same library. Samples “K-“ is a negative control of the library prepared without the input of bacterial RNA.\n(B) The purified cDNA libraries 1 and 2 resolved on a native PAA gel along with GeneRuler 50 bp DNA Ladder. The libraries were amplified by 12 cycles of first round and 4 cycles of second round PCRs (16 cycles in total).\n(C) The purified cDNA library 1 resolved on an Agilent DNA 1000 chip.\nTiming: 3–5 h (day 8)\nPurify the PCR product using the RNeasy MinElute kit. Follow the protocol (i.e. do not add increased volume of ethanol to the mixture of PCR reaction and RLT buffer). At the final step elute from the column with 20 μL of nuclease-free water.",
    "Purify the PCR product using AMPure XP beads. Use 1:1 volume ratio of AMPure XP beads and PCR reaction (i.e. mix 20 μL of beads with 20 μL of PCR product). Elute with 20 μL of nuclease-free water.\nMeasure the concentration of PCR product (library) on nanodrop. Resolve 5 μL of the library on 1.5% agarose or native PAA gel (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) to study the distribution of the lengths of the fragments. For more precise determination of the lengths of the fragments use Agilent bioanalyzer with Agilent DNA 1000 Kit (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nNote: At this step the negative control should not have any visible DNA sequences.\nNote: We recommend to clone the cDNA library (e.g. using the CloneJET PCR Cloning Kit from ThermoFisher) and sequence the inserts from 5 to 10 clones. This will ensure that both the 5′ and 3′ sequencing adapters are present in the fragments. Also, it will be possible to estimate the percentage of modified adenines and cytosines. Normally, 4%–6% of adenines and cytosines should be DMS modified. After mapping to the genome sequence, the modified bases can be identified as mismatches in cDNA sequences [Problem 4].\nNote: To obtain sequencing depth sufficient for comparison of 5′ UTR structures of highly expressed L. monocytogenes mRNAs we sequenced the libraries comprising 10 million reads. However, to compare the structures of moderately and low expressed transcripts it would be necessary to increase the sequencing volume to 50–100 million of reads per replicate."
