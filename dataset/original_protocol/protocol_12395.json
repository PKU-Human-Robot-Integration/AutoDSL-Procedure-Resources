    "NOTE: The University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all experiments.\n1. Preparation of Ultrasound-microinjection Instruments and Embryos\nSet up stage, mount, and probe (Figure 1) as well as surgical instruments (Figure 2). Place phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution (pH7.4) in a 37 °C warming bath. Fill microinjection needle entirely with mineral oil, using 1 ml syringe attached to a second flexible 25 G needle, through its base.\nFix needle onto rotation mount arm, and empty needle of mineral oil solution. Re-fill with 2.5 μl of TL solution. Ensure that no air bubbles are present within the injection needle. Rotate needle arm toward wall, away from the stage.\nAnesthetize the pregnant mother in anesthesia chamber via continuous infusion of isoflurane. When mother is rendered unconscious, transfer the anesthesia to nose tube positioned on the caudal side of the stage, and place mother in supine position with snout in nose tube to allow a continuation of a fully anesthetized state.\nTape limbs in 45° angles, or with hands and feet rested and positioned overtop ECG/Temperature monitor tabs. It is important that the pregnant dam is continually monitored to ensure that anesthesia is sufficient and that ointment in applied to the eyes to reduce drying.\nApply hair removal product across lower abdomen of the mother, gently wipe off with dry cotton swabs, and then again with a 70% ethanol-saturated cotton swabs to remove any excess product and hair. Ensure to clean abdominal skin off of all hair at site of incision (Figure 3).",
    "Perform a laparotomy on the pregnant mother using fine surgical forceps and scissors. Take care to avoid cutting any major vessels or visceral organs. Make first, straight incision of epidermis 1.5-2 cm above vagina and continue cut towards ribs for approximately 2-3 cm. Expose the subcutaneous membrane, locate the linea alba (“white line”) (Figure 3), and cut parallel to initial incision, along the same length, to expose internal visceral organs and uterine saccules.\n2. Extraction of Embryos\nUse 6-inch cotton-tipped applicators to maneuver mother and embryos. Gently push (do not force) on skin with applicator to manipulate first embryo out of incision opening. After extraction of the first embryo saccule, gently and slowly pull the remainder of the uterine horn through and onto the mother’s exterior. Avoid pulling intestine or other organs through incision at this stage.\nQuantify embryos and gently place left uterine horn back into mother. Then begin placing the right uterine horn back into mother starting with the embryo saccule furthest from the vagina on the horn and moving downward. Continue this until only two embryos remain exposed (Figure 4). Lastly, position embryos in a column above and parallel to incision line, being cognizant not to cut off uterine circulation.\nPlace clay blocks and position between arms and body, as well as legs and tail. Ensure that the clay surfaces are approximately level with laparotomy incision. Wet the fenestrated Petri dish with 37 °C PBS.\nGrasp extending forceps with right hand and fenestrated Petri dish with left hand (fenestration parallel to embryos) and bring closed forceps ~5-cm through fenestration, from the top of the Petri dish. Open forceps completely without tearing fenestration mesh.",
    "Maneuver hands above embryos and focus sight on the two embryo saccules. Without (or lightly) touching saccules with fenestration meshing or forceps, slide them through slit and set Petri dish onto mother’s abdomen. With forceps still extended, manipulate fenestrated mesh to seat it on either side and at base of each embryo (Figure 5) and pull forceps out of slit opening.\nNext, place blue rubber containing wall in Petri dish, without pinching or injuring embryos (Figure 6). Make sure clay blocks are firmly balancing Petri dish, embryo, and rubber-containing wall. Lastly, fill Petri dish with 37 °C PBS until embryos are completely submerged (Figure 6), while controlling for leaks at fenestrated meshing.\n3. Injection Procedure\nLower injection stage with mother and embryos down using Z-level adjustment knob (Figure 1) and then rotate injection needle and mount arm and line up directly with ultrasound probe, with needle ½ cm to the left and under the probe tip (Figure 7). Push needle-arm (not needle) 45° away from the probe. Be careful not to hit the tip of the needle with the dish or ultrasound probe.\nRaise injection stage back to original height, with ultrasound probe directly above embryos Probe must be slightly submerged and within 3-4 mm of the embryonic tissue. Use X & Y stage adjustment knobs (Figure 8) to amend embryo/mother/stage position to systematically locate the beating embryonic heart.\nDirectly Center of ultrasound screen observe a black center target marker drawn (*). Locate left ventricle (preferable) or atrium using the X & Y stage adjustment knobs (Figure 8) and then raise or lower the stage using revolving knob on the stage to position injection target precisely over the black center marker on the ultrasound screen.",
    "Use X stage adjustment knob to move embryo to the right, off of the ultrasound screen. Reposition microinjection needle and arm back into place, ½ cm away from and 90° to the ultrasound probe (Figure 7).\nUsing microinjection mount adjustment knobs (Figure 9C-G), position needle with the tip clearly aligned with the center marker. Adjust injection angle (using knobs in Figure 9C & E-G), and X, Y, and Z vectors of micro-needle to ensure needle tip is focused in the correct plane. Retract microinjection needle using solely the “injection” knob (Figure 9F), careful not to adjust other dimensions.\nAgain, using solely the X fine-adjustment stage knob move embryo back under the probe, with target exactly on the center mark on the ultrasound screen. Ensure that the left ventricle is now exactly on the same X, Y, and Z plane.\nNext, with just the “injection” knob on the microinjection mount, slowly puncture embryo with the microinjection needle and gradually bring tip into the left ventricle. Inject the full 2.5 μl of TL solution into left ventricle or until the empty warning beep sounds, by holding “empty” and tapping “fill” once (Figures 2A & B). At this time of injection observe a shadow emanating from the tip of the needle which is the TL entering into the cardiac chamber (Figure 10). In reverse, quickly retract microinjection needle rotating the “injection” knob (Figure 9F) on the microinjection mount when injection is complete.\nContinue on to next embryo and repeat this procedure for remaining embryos following this series of steps and finally place the final embryos back into the dam’s abdomen. Switch anesthesia to chamber box and gently move mother here for 15 min from time of the last injection.\n4. Harvesting Embryos and Analysis",
    "Sacrifice dam via cervical dislocation. Expand the laparotomy incision to easily remove uterine horns from the mother. Keep the embryos within uterine sac. Place embryos in chilled PBS.\nDissect embryos from uterine sac (if necessary collect tissue for genotyping) and place the whole embryo in 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight, then into 30% sucrose overnight, freeze in cryostat sectioning medium. Then cut the cryosection and place it onto slides for immunohistochemical analysis. Optionally, use tissues for whole-mount by dehydrating in 100% methanol, following fixation in 4% PFA.\nFor immunohistochemical analysis place the cryosections into PBS to remove the OCT. Then block the sections with 10% normal donkey serum for 30 min. Then add PECAM primary antibody at 1:100 dilution overnight at 4 °C. The next day, wash the slides in PBT 3 times for 10 min each and add donkey anti rat 594 secondary and incubate for 1 hr at RT.\n\tNOTE: This is a highly demanding technique requiring the optimization and coordination of ultrasound and microinjection. There is a very steep learning curve related to this technique and requires four to six weeks of mentored injections before one becomes proficient.\nSubscription Required.
