    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\n      It is essential to perform steps 1–3 (Agarose injection, Tissue\n      preparation and Slice procedure) in a timely manner to ensure tissue\n      viability. Slices maintain viability much better compared to tissue pieces\n      due to better oxygenation.\n    \nAgarose injection\nTiming: 10 min\n      This section describes how to inflate the pancreas with low-melting point\n      agarose to generate slices for following functional experiments. This step\n      does not apply for human tissue.\n    \nEuthanize the mouse by cervical dislocation.\n        Place the mouse under a stereomicroscope and wet the abdominal fur with\n        70% ethanol (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2793-Fig1.jpg\n              Figure 1. Pancreas injection procedure of low melting point\n              agarose through the common bile duct related to step 1\n            \n              (A) Preparation of euthanized mouse for procedure by opening of\n              the abdomen.\n            \n(B) Exposure of common bile duct.\n(C) Clamping of intestine.\n              (D) Injection with support of tweezers from below. Pancreas\n              (P) indicated by dashed line.\n            \n(E) Partially inflated pancreas.\n(F) Fully injected pancreas.\n        Expose the organs by opening the abdomen using surgical scissors and\n        flip over liver for easier access and visibility (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C).\n      \n        Clamp off the common bile duct at the ampulla of Vater to avoid drainage\n        into the duodenum (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\n      \n        Clean the duct from fat or connective tissue for easier access (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\n      \n        Cannulate the common bile duct using a 30-gauge needle and 5 mL syringe\n        with Luer-Lok-Tip (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\n      \nNote: Needle scan be bend between 30–90\n      degrees angle for easier injection.\n    \n        Steadily inject 2–3 mL of low-melting agarose until pancreas is fully\n        inflated.\n      \n        Remove the hardened pancreas and place in a dish filled with HEPES\n        buffer (containing baseline glucose concentration; we use 7 mM for mice\n        and 5.5 mM for human tissue slices).\n      \nCritical: Full inflation of the\n      pancreas is essential for successful slicing procedure and maximal",
    "outcome. This step requires fast handling as agarose will solidify quickly\n      and thus block the syringe. Note that the injection procedure is performed\n      the same way as for islet isolation.\n    \nTissue preparation\nTiming: 5 min\nThis step describes the preparation of the tissue prior to slicing.\nNote: For human samples, tissue is emerged\n      with 3.8% low-melting agarose (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\n    \n        Gently remove connective, fibrotic, adipose tissue and sections that are\n        not inflated with agarose (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B).\n      \n        Cut tissue into small cubes of about 0.5 cm3 size (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\n      \n        Inspect pieces under the stereomicroscope. If necessary, remove thick\n        ducts and fibrotic, adipose tissue.\n      \nBlot dry tissue pieces shortly before embedding in agarose.\n        Transfer 4–5 tissue blocks into a 35-mm petri dish and fill up with\n        low-melting agarose until tissue is fully submerged (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2793-Fig2.jpg\n              Figure 2.

Use multiple dishes\n      for larger amounts.\n    \nCritical: Continue with perifusion or\n      imaging in a timely manner to ensure tissue viability. Slices can be kept\n      in HEPES buffer (containing baseline glucose concentration and aprotinin)\n      at 22°C for up to 1 h. If more time is needed place slices in an incubator\n      at 37°C (in HEPES buffer with glucose and aprotinin). For culture of\n      tissue slices use appropriate culture conditions (see MMF Qadir for a\n      detailed culture protocol3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\n    \nNote: Place dish with slices on a slowly\n      moving shaker to allow wash out of digestive enzymes and improve viability\n      if kept longer.\n    \n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \n          Methods video S1.

For the\n        protocol above plate needs to be changed once after 90 min and once\n        after 48 min.\n      \nNote: Plate 1 will always be for flushing\n      and does not have to be collected or measured for hormone release. If\n      calculated correctly the first plate need to be placed after 90 min.\n    \nNote: The timing to change the plate\n      depends on the number of chambers and seconds chosen to collect samples.\n    \n        If hormones are measured directly after perifusion, store plates at 4°C.\n        Otherwise store at −80°C to avoid degradation of hormones.\n      \n        After protocol is finished, stop heater and cooling pump, disconnect\n        chambers from machine and place in chamber holder.\n      \n        Disassemble chambers and collect slices from each chamber.
