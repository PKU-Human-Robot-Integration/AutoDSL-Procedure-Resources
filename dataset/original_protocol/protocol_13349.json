    "This scanning protocol is for clinical training and has not been published elsewhere. The ultrasound images were obtained from a volunteer and de-identified. As per the institutional guidelines, this protocol is beyond the Common Rule and FDA definition of the human research subject, and formal IRB approval is not required.\n1. Transducer and image optimization\nUse a linear array 12-4 MHz transducer. This is a high-frequency transducer for superficial imaging structures.\nPractice holding the transducer at a 90° angle to the skin with both hands and standing on both sides of the patient, which may be necessary when working in a limited space. Apply light pressure on the neck. Otherwise, the image becomes distorted.\nPractice transducer manipulation with fine movements for image optimization.\n\t\nSmall adjustments are often required to obtain a better image. Try holding the probe like a pencil. Do not rest the hand part on the neck, as this distorts the image.\nPractice using different models of ultrasound machines with different linear arrays, 12-4 MHz or 12-5 MHz, 13-6 MHz, or curvilinear C5-1 MHz transducers to adjust to different weights.\nPractice image optimization.\n\t\nPractice knobology manipulation for an optimal image using focus, gain, time compensation (TGC), depth, and zoom.\n\t\tNOTE: The ideal depth is 3.5-4 cm.\n\t\t\nAvoid too much and too little gain, which creates a poor image.\nUse time gain compensation (TGC) to adjust the near/far field gain. This fine-tunes the gain at a specific grayscale depth for an optimal image.\nZoom in to the desired area of interest.\nPractice freezing, measuring, and acquiring the images.\n2. Patient position\nPlace the patient in a supine position without a pillow.",
    "Ask the patient to maintain the head and neck in a neutral position to ensure standardization.The sniffing position may be unattainable in head and neck cancer patients, and the neutral position achieves the best measurements.\nAsk the patient to rest their tongue on the lower incisors. The tongue position within the mouth changes the thickness of the soft tissues; therefore, the tongue should always be in the same position during ultrasound examination to ensure consistency.\n3. Transducer technique for image optimization\nApply a gel medium between the transducer and the skin so that there is no air in between.\n\tNOTE: Ultrasound waves do not travel through the air.\nPlace the transducer transversely on the anterior neck with minimal pressure, and preserve skin contact.\n\tNOTE: Pressure applied to the anterior neck can narrow the upper airway, change the tissue measurements, elicit coughing, and make the patient uncomfortable.\nPlace the transducer midline on the central axis in the transverse position.\nStart from the submandibular space, and, with slow fine movements, move the transducer caudally.\n\t​NOTE: The superficial location of the larynx helps in the identification of its structures. The anterior neck soft tissue thickness is obtained at five points.\n4. Hyomental distance (HMD, Figure 1)\nPlace the transducer longitudinally in the submental space along the body's central axis to obtain a submandibular image.\n\tNOTE: The floor of the mouth image shows a fine tissue echogenicity between the acoustic shadows of the mentum and the hyoid bone. The hard palate is hyperechoic and is depicted as a white line.\nClick on Freeze.\nClick on Measure. Measure from the outer border of the mentum to the hyoid bone. The distance in centimeters (cm) will pop up on the screen.\nClick on Acquire.",
    "Rotate the transducer in the transverse position, and place it over the central axis of the neck.\nManipulate the transducer with fine slow movements caudally to visualize the following structures7.\n5. Thyrohyoid membrane (THM, Figure 2)\nPalpate the thyroid cartilage and the hyoid bone, and place the transducer in between in the transverse position, making sure to stay in the central axis of the neck.\n\tNOTE: The thyrohyoid membrane expands from the caudal border of the hyoid bone to the cephalad border of the thyroid cartilage. The epiglottis comes into view as a hypoechoic curvilinear structure, and is a dark space.\nClick on Freeze.\nClick on Measure. Measure from the skin to the anterior border of the epiglottis in the center. The distance in centimeters (cm) will pop up on the screen.\nClick on Acquire.\nMove the transducer 1 cm to the right.\nClick on Freeze.\nClick on Measure. Measure the distance from the skin to the anterior border of the epiglottis. The distance will pop up in centimeters (cm) on the screen.\nClick on Acquire.\nMove the transducer 1 cm to the left of the center, and repeat steps 5.6-5.8.\nAverage the three measurements to obtain the THM8.\n6. Distance from the skin to the epiglottis (DSE, Figure 3)\nKeep the transducer in the same position, and stay in the neck's central axis.\n\tNOTE: The epiglottis should be in view. The epiglottis is a hypoechoic curvilinear structure seen as a dark space, and it remains so throughout the patient's life. Posteriorly, the air mucosal interface is a bright white line.\nClick on Freeze.\nClick on Measure. Measure from the skin to the center of the bright white line. The distance in centimeters (cm) will pop up on the screen.\nClick on Acquire.",
    "Move the probe 1 cm left of the midline.\nClick on Freeze.\nClick on Measure. Measure from the skin to the bright white line. The distance in centimeters (cm) will pop up on the screen.\nClick on Acquire.\nMove the transducer 1 cm to the right of the midline, and repeat steps 6.6-6.8.\nAverage the three measurements to obtain the DSE9.\n7. Distance from the skin to the hyoid bone (SHB, Figure 4)\nAngle the transducer tail slightly down (about 20°), palpate the hyoid bone, and place the transducer directly over the hyoid bone, making sure to stay in the central axis of the neck.\n\tNOTE: The hyoid bone is seen as a bright echogenic line curved upside down. Below is a hypoechoic shadow.\nClick on Freeze.\nClick on Measure. Measure from the skin to the center of the hyoid bone. The distance in centimeters (cm) will pop up on the screen.\nClick on Acquire.\nMove the probe 1 cm lateral to the midline on the left.\nClick on Freeze.\nClick on Measure. Measure from the skin to the hyoid bone. A distance in centimeters (cm) will pop up on the screen.\nClick on Acquire.\nMove the transducer 1 cm to the right of the midline, and repeat steps 7.6-7.8\nAverage the three measurements to obtain the SHB distance10.\n8. Distance from the skin to the vocal cords (SVC, Figure 5)\nPlace the ultrasound probe transversely over the thyroid cartilage, making sure to stay in the central axis of the neck.\n\tNOTE: The thyroid cartilage is visualized as a large upside-down V-shaped structure with fine tissue echogenicity. The vocal cords are two triangular shapes within the V-shaped structure.\nClick on Freeze.",
    "Click on Measure. Measure from the skin to the upper border of the right vocal cord. The distance in centimeters (cm) will pop up on the screen.\nClick on Acquire.\nRepeat steps 8.2-8.4 on the left vocal cord.\nAverage the two measurements to obtain the SVC11.\nSubscription Required.
