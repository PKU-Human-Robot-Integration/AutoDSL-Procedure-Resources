    "P-LISA is a technology that overcomes the capacity of classical immunohistochemical assays to allow the direct visualization of endogenous PPIs in situ (Söderberg et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-bib-0028]). The P-LISA, as a proximity ligation assay approach (Fredriksson et al., 2002[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-bib-0012]), depends on dual proximal binding by pairs of detection reagents, for example, two primary antibodies that recognize target antigens (e.g., GPCR) under study (Fig. 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0001]). Primary antibodies, which are raised in different species, are readily detected by specific secondary antibodies containing a single complementary short DNA strand, also called a PLA probe (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0001]). When PLA probes from two secondary antibodies are close to each other (≤40 nm), they can interact, and aided by two subsequently added linear connector oligonucleotides, they generate an amplifiable circular DNA strand (Fig. 1C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0001]) that serves as template for a local rolling-circle amplification (RCA) reaction (Fig. 1C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0001]). The RCA reaction generates a single-stranded product covalently linked to the antibody-antigen complex, which can be easily detected by complementary hybridization of fluorescent-labeled oligonucleotides (Fig. 1C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0001]). Overall, protein targets can be readily detected and localized with single-molecule resolution by means of fluorescence microscopy, thus allowing unbiased quantification of PPIs in unmodified cells and tissues. Hence, although other technologies can be implemented to unequivocally demonstrate the occurrence of GPCR oligomerization in native tissue (i.e., TR-FRET using fluorescent ligands), the P-LISA assay is a powerful and straightforward technology to uncover these types of subcellular events, either transient or weak interactions, within specific subpopulations of cells in situ.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f8577c7a-2c17-4735-a8d7-a98795cc3941/cpz1794-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1",
    "Schematic representation of the proximity ligation in situ assay (P-LISA). (A) Specific primary antibodies against GPCRs are used to detect each receptor, and secondary specie-specific antibodies conjugated with oligonucleotides (PLA probe MINUS and PLA probe PLUS, illustrated as blue and orange bands, respectively) recognize the primary antibody. (B) Two oligonucleotides (illustrated as green and clear-green bands) hybridize with the PLA probes. When the PLA probes are in close proximity (≤40 nm) a circular ssDNA might be formed (dark green rectangle). The open circular ssDNA could be closed by the action of T4 DNA-Ligase (illustrated as a pink oval). (C) Closed circular ssDNA can serve as a template for phi29 DNA polymerase (illustrated as a sky-blue oval) that extends the 3’-OH ends of one of the PLA probes, acting as a primer for rolling circle amplification (RCA). Finally, the generated concatemeric product is hybridized with fluorescent oligonucleotide probes (red spots).\nMaterials\nCD1 mouse (in-house colony)\nKetamine (50 mg/ml; Ketalar, Panpharma)\nXylazine (20 mg/ml; Rompun, Bayer)\n70% ethanol\n4% formaldehyde solution (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 1040021000)\n1× PBS (see recipe)\nSodium azide (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 769320-100G)\nWalter's antifreezing solution (see recipe)\nTriton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no.

This guideline provides an onset of 3-5 min with 30-40 min of anesthesia duration for surgical purposes.\nOf note, in our protocol, animals are housed and tested in compliance with the guidelines described in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Clark et al., 1997[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-bib-0004]) and following the European Community, law 86/609/CCE, FELASA and ARRIVE guidelines. The protocol is approved by our Committee on Animal Use and Care. Thus, the animals are housed in standard cages with ad libitum access to food and water and maintained under controlled standard conditions (12 hr dark/light cycle starting at 7:30 a.m., 22°C temperature and 66% humidity). Regarding anesthesia, we recommend a barbiturate type (i.e., ketamine/xylazine combination), since gaseous types (i.e., fluothane) tend to constrict vessels, resulting in poor fixative perfusion.\n1. Add 2 ml 50 mg/ml ketamine (100 mg) and 0.5 ml 20 mg/ml xylazine (10 mg) to 7.5 ml sterile water to generate 10 ml ketamine/xylazine anesthetic solution. Mix very well by gentle inversion.\nThis solution can be stored at 4°C for a maximum of 2 weeks.\n2. Weigh the animal and inject intraperitoneally 0.1 ml of the ketamine/xylazine anesthetic solution per 10 g body weight (100 mg/kg ketamine, 10 mg/kg xylazine) using a 27-gauge needle and 1-cc syringe (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0002]). Wait 3-5 min until the animal is deeply anesthetized.",
    "To increase the duration of the anesthetic effect, the dose of xylazine can be increased (i.e., 15 mg/kg).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e42a4630-620f-4ab8-b77c-45d036ba01fa/cpz1794-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nSchematic representation of tissue fixation and brain slice generation. The steps show the standard procedure for obtaining brain slices from a whole fixed animal. The anesthetized animal is perfused intracardially with a solution containing 4% formaldehyde. The brain is then extracted and post-fixed overnight. Finally, brain slices are obtained using a vibratome and kept at −20°C.\n3. Once the animal is unconscious, check that the withdrawal reflexes (toe pinch) are absent. Lay the animal dorsally on a rack above a container and secure each paw to the rack with tape or a pin (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0002]).\n4. Clean the ventral chest area with 70% ethanol and make an inverted T-cut through the skin and the abdominal wall caudal to the last rib. Open the thoracic cavity by cutting with scissors through the base of the sternum, perpendicular to the first cut.\nBe careful not to damage the heart or lungs (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0002]).\n5. Expose the heart by holding the rips out using forceps. Tear the pericardium with the help of blunt forceps (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0002]).\n6. Switch on the perfusion valve to start the flow. Insert the perfusion needle (25-gauge, 25-mm or wider if the flow rate is not fast enough) into the left ventricle and make an incision in the right atrium to quickly drain fluids (a great deal of blood will be released; Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0002]).\n7. Perfuse with 100 ml cold 1× PBS.\nThe reservoir (i.e., 50-ml syringe) containing the PBS solution should be maintained (and continuously refilled) at 100 cm above the animal to ensure sufficient perfusion pressure through the circulatory system. The blood from the circulatory system will exit through the incision performed in the right atrium.",
    "Increase the flow using larger gauge needles or increasing the height of the reservoir. This will provide better results. Typically, it will take 1-10 min to wash the circulatory system with the PBS solution, following which the eyes and liver will become clear. For rat, use 200 ml 1× PBS solution.\n8. Perfuse with ∼100 ml of ice-cold 4% formaldehyde in 1× PBS.\nTremors should be observed within seconds and at the end of the fixation process and the animal should be stiff.\nDue to the toxic nature of formaldehyde, all perfusion procedures should be performed under the fume hood, and gloves and a lab coat should be used. The formaldehyde should be collected and stored for disposal according to the regulations of your institution. For rat, use 200 ml of fixative solution. The organs and the whole animal should be rigid (including the tail) to the touch once the fixative solution has passed through the body.\n9. Dissect and post-fix the brain by incubation (24 hr) in the same fixative solution (4% formaldehyde) at 4°C. Swirl occasionally. Wash the brain with 1× PBS by exchanging the medium three times, swirling each time.\nThe brain can then be stored in 1× PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) sodium azide at 4°C.\n10. Obtain brain coronal sections (50-70 μm) using a vibratome (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0002]).\n11. Keep the slices in Walter's antifreezing solution at −20°C until use.\nSlices should be manipulated with a round brush (size 10/0) to avoid tissue damage (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0002]).\nFree-floating P-LISA protocol\n12. Rinse the slices three times for 10 minutes each with 1 ml 1× PBS to remove Walter's antifreezing solution (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0003], step 1).\nUse the round brush to manipulate the slices during the washing steps.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/adf18293-fefc-400f-a43b-6bc9ad16ec04/cpz1794-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3",

Several free-floating steps are performed: permeabilization, blocking, primary antibody incubation, PLA probe recognition, ligation, RCA (including detection) and mounting.\n13. Wash slices with 1 ml 1× PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 for 2 hr at room temperature (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0003], step 2).\n14. Wash the slices three times for 10 min each with 1 ml of 1× PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100 (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0003], step 2).\n15. Incubate slices with 250 μl blocking solution for 2 hr at room temperature (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0003], step 3).\n16. Incubate the slices with 100 μl blocking solution containing the primary antibodies overnight at 4°C (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0003], step 3).\nPrimary antibodies against the antigens under study (i.e., A2AR and D2R) should be raised in different animal species to avoid cross-reactivity of the PLA probes. For example, in the example provided here, goat anti-A2AR and rabbit anti-D2R polyclonal antibodies (Frontier Institute Co. Ltd., Shinko-nishi, Ishikari, Hokkaido, Japan) are used, as previously described (Fernández-Dueñas et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-bib-0008]). In addition, primary antibody specificity should previously be demonstrated by conventional immunofluorescence staining under the same experimental conditions described here. In addition, each antibody pair used should be specifically titrated for the P-LISA experiment.\n17. Dilute 1:5 the two PLA probes provided by the manufacturer in a blocking solution and allow the mixture to stabilize for 20 min at room temperature.\nPLA probes are species-specific secondary antibodies that contain a unique short DNA strand attached to them. Hence, PLA probes are verified both for specificity (e.g., for a goat primary antibody use a PLA-probe anti-goat) and for complementarities (e.g., one PLUS and another MINUS).\n18. Wash slices for 10 min with 1 ml of 1× PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and 1% NDS at room temperature (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0003], step 4).",
    "19. Incubate slices with 100 μl blocking solution containing the PLA probes for 1 hr at 37°C (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0003], step 4).\nVortex the PLA probe mixture before adding to the slices. Note that steps 6 to 8 of Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0003] are performed in a similar manufacturer protocol manner.\n20. Wash slices twice for 5 min each with 1 ml P-LISA wash buffer A at room temperature (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0003], step 5).\n21. Prepare 1× ligation solution by diluting 1:5 the 5× ligation stock solution (see recipe) with high grade pure water.\n22. Incubate slices with 100 μl of 1× ligation solution containing 0.025 U/μl of T4 DNA ligase (prepared by diluting 1:40 the 1 U/μl T4 DNA ligase into the 1× ligation solution) for 30 min at 37°C (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0003], step 5).\nThe T4 DNA ligase should be maintained at −20°C until diluted; use a freezing block (−20°C) to transport. The ligation solution containing the diluted T4 DNA ligase should be used immediately upon preparation.\n23. Wash slices twice for 2 min each with 1 ml P-LISA wash buffer A at room temperature (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0003], step 6).\n24. Prepare the RCA solution (1×) by diluting 1:5 the 5× RCA solution (see recipe) with high grade pure water.\nThe RCA solution (1×) contains 1 mM dNTPs, 5% glycerol, 0.25 μg/μl BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 according to previously reported information (Jarvius et al., 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-bib-0017]). In addition, this solution contains the fluorescently labeled red probe that hybridizes with the single-stranded RCA product and that can be visualized using a red-based laser system (see below).\n25. Dilute 1:40 phi29 DNA polymerase (10 U/μl) into the RCA solution (1×). Incubate slices with 100 μl RCA solution containing 0.25 U/μl of phi29 DNA polymerase for 2 hr at 37 ° C (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0003], step 6).",
    "This step must be performed using opaque Eppendorf tubes (or tubes covered with aluminum foil), since the RCA solution is light sensitive. The phi29 DNA polymerase should be maintained at −20°C until diluted; use a freezing block (−20°C) for transport. The RCA solution containing the diluted phi29 DNA polymerase should be used immediately upon preparation.\n26. Wash slices twice for 10 min each with 1 ml P-LISA wash buffer B at room temperature (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0003], Step 7).\n27. Wash slices for 1 min with 1 ml of 0.01× P-LISA wash buffer B at room temperature (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0003], Step 7).\nThis wash step aims to remove salts from the slice prior to mounting for observation. Thus, we recommend keeping slices in wash buffer B for 5-10 min until ready for mounting (slices may collapse and deform if they stand for a long time in 0.01× wash buffer B).\n28. Place and extend the slices on a microscope slide containing a drop of 0.01× P-LISA wash buffer B (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0003], step 8).\n29. Add 10 μl of Duolink in situ mounting medium (or an equivalent) containing DAPI to each slice. Place a coverslip on top of the slice and avoid the formation of air bubbles. Seal the cover slip with transparent nail polish (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0003], step 8).\nThe slides are kept in the dark for at least 1 hr before analysis in a confocal microscope. The slides can be stored at 4°C for a maximum of 2 weeks, and for longer periods at −20⁰C.",
    "Slide observation, image acquisition, and quantification constitute a key step for the interpretation of the P-LISA results. Indeed, obtaining good P-LISA images depends on various optical factors that are far beyond the scope of the present protocol and have been discussed elsewhere (Smith, 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-bib-0027]). Consequently, the use of a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) system allowing a specimen's depth discrimination and contrast is highly recommended. Therefore, the P-LISA-stained brain slice mounted on a confocal fluorescence microscope slide is observed as a static image in the LSCM using the appropriate excitation/emission wavelengths. Once the whole brain slice is observed, a region of interest (ROI) is selected and the thickness within the z-plane is determined. Next, serial optical thin sections are collected through the fluorescent ROI in steps of 0.2-0.5 μm perpendicular to the z-axis (microscope optical axis) using proper illumination of the laser system. The image series are collected by coordinating incremental changes in the microscope fine focus mechanism—by using a stepper motor—with sequential image acquisition at each step. Therefore, the information from each collected image is limited to a definite specimen plane. Since confocal microscopy allows for a reduction in background fluorescence and improves the signal-to-noise ratio, the contrast and definition of the collected images are dramatically improved over wide-field microscopy (Smith, 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-bib-0027]). On the other hand, confocal optical sectioning eliminates artifacts that occur during physical manipulation (i.e., sectioning and P-LISA) of tissue specimens. Finally, the confocal optical sections in the x-y plane and collected on the z-axis are combined along the z-axis with the confocal microscopy software package, projecting a view of fluorescence intensity. Alternatively, image stacks can be composed and analyzed using an open-source Java-based image processing program allowing Java plugins and recordable macros (i.e., ImageJ or Fiji; Schneider et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-bib-0026]).\nMaterials",

Visualize the region of interest (ROI) of each slice (i.e., striatum) using LSCM (i.e., Leica TCS 4D) with the aid of a 60× N.A. = 1.42 oil objective.\nThe use of an LSCM is essential to allow the precise location of the RCPs within a slice of 50-70 μm thickness. The DAPI stained nuclei within the ROI are visualized by exciting the slide at 364 nm using an UV laser and the fluorescence emission is collected at 460 nm. Similarly, the PLA probe detection is visualized throughout the oligonucleotide probes typically labeled with a red fluorophore (λex=594 nm and λem=624 nm) using a 561-nm laser system.\nImage acquisition\n2. Acquire independently the DAPI and PLA probe high-resolution images from a 5-μm thick optical section of each ROI. Establish a z-interval of 0.2 μm, to obtain a z-stack of 25 sections.\nThe images should ideally be saved as an 8-bit RGB .tiff-format image and the dimensions can be either 1024 × 1024 or 512 × 512.\nQuantification\nImage processing\n3. Open ImageJ and load the stacks \"DAPI.tif\" and \"PLA.tif.\"\nThis can be achieved by selecting [File > Open…], or simply by dragging and dropping the files into the ImageJ menu bar.\n4. Create a maximum intensity projection image for both stacks by selecting [Image > Stack > Z project… > Max intensity].\nThis will generate a new image that displays the maximum pixel intensity across all the slices in the stack.

Perform a background subtraction on both z-projection images using the built-in function in ImageJ by selecting [Process > Subtract background…].\nAlthough the nuclei and PLA spots differ in size, we found that the default rolling ball radius of 50.0 pixels produced good results for both sample images (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0005]). To ensure accurate background subtraction, set the radius to at least the size of the largest object in the image that is not part of the background (i.e., nuclei). To determine the radius of the largest objects in your image, you can use the line tool to draw a line from one edge of the object to the other, and the length will be reported in the ImageJ toolbar. The default rolling ball radius value in ImageJ is 50.0 pixels, which may be suitable for some images, but might need to be adjusted for others depending on the size of the objects in question.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/45336ba2-c9e0-4bf1-b6b0-19cb3ca4a321/cpz1794-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nScheme of the specific sequence of ImageJ commands necessary to perform a Z projection from a stack (n = 25) of DAPI (A) and PLA (B).

Enhance the visual contrast of the images by displaying both z-projections in grayscale (as shown in Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0005]), by selecting [Image > Lookup Tables > Grays] and selecting the grayscale option.",
    "This will help bring out the details and make it easier to distinguish between different structures in the image.\n7. Adjust the brightness and contrast by selecting [Image > Adjust > Brightness/Contrast…] and adjust the settings until you reach the desired level of contrast.\nThis step can help enhance the image if you find that the spots in your z-projections are too weak or difficult to see. However, be careful not to change the threshold values from one image to the next, as this can affect the comparability of your results. Figure 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0006] provides an example of how adjusting brightness and contrast can improve the visibility of spots.\nWhen adjusting the brightness and contrast of your z-projections, aim to make the background as dark as possible and the signal as uniform and bright as possible. Keep a record of the settings used so that you can apply the same parameters to the rest of the images in your experimental set. Note that the settings you use may differ between channels, but they must remain consistent for the corresponding channels across all the images analyzed. It is important to remember that changing the background and contrast of the images will alter the original intensity values. Although this may not be critical for particle analysis, it could potentially impact other parameters and subsequent image analysis. Therefore, it is important to exercise caution and ensure that any adjustments made are necessary and well-documented.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/dda3124a-4fcb-4cdf-936b-b5b8e90eb1cc/cpz1794-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\nDigital transformations scheme for image analysis in ImageJ.

Apply a smoothing filter to improve the image quality by selecting [Process > Smooth] and select the desired smoothing filter.\nIf your resulting images exhibit excess noise or have particles with holes or gaps, this can help reduce noise and improve the appearance of particles in the image, making them easier to analyze.\nIf individual particles show gaps that could affect counting (particle analysis; nuclei analysis and PLA signal analysis, steps 11 and 13, respectively), then use the smooth filter to blur the active image or selection. This filter replaces each pixel with the average of its 3 × 3 surroundings.\n9. Segment z-projections and convert them into binary images (black-and-white representations of the original image; as shown in Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0006]) by selecting [Process > Binary > Make Binary] and select the desired thresholding method.\nThis will help separate the foreground (signal) from the background, making it easier to identify and analyze individual particles and facilitate the analysis.\nImageJ provides various global thresholding methods that can be accessed through [Image > Adjust > AutoThreshold]. This feature allows you to test different methods and select the one that best fits your specific images. For the provided sample images, the default automatic thresholding method is sufficient. This method works by taking a test threshold and calculating the averages of the pixels below and above it. Then it computes the average of these two values, increments the threshold, and repeats the process iteratively until the threshold is greater than the composite average. This approach can effectively distinguish between the foreground (signal) and the background, producing binary images that are suitable for further analysis.\nNuclei analysis\nIn this section, the cells of interest are counted using the binary mask that results from nuclei segmentation.",
    "10. Perform a watershed transformation (Fig. 7A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0007]) to separate objects that appear contiguous in the binary mask by selecting [Process > Binary > Watershed].\nThis step is useful when the nuclei overlap or are very close to each other and are therefore difficult to resolve spatially.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c74b3109-cea1-4b11-bc20-bf89eda8612f/cpz1794-fig-0007-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 7\nParticle signal analysis scheme in ImageJ. Example of DAPI-stained nuclei and PLA probe images with specific instructions for: (A) optional watershed filter application; (B) particle analysis and counting of the total number of nuclei; (C) composite transformation of both channels. Red arrows in (A) indicate examples of object segmentation and separation achieved by applying the watershed filter. Scale bar: 10 µm.\n11. Count nuclei >30 μm2 in the resulting binary image by selecting [Analyze > Analyze particles …] (Fig. 7B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0007]) and setting the following parameters: Size (μm2), 30-Infinity; Show, Outlines; and Display results.\nIt is well established that within the brain (i.e., striatum), neurons and glial cells can be discriminated by the size of their respective nucleus (Matamales et al., 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-bib-0020]). Therefore, if the interaction upon study is expected to take place in neurons, as the example provided here, the glial nuclei (<30 μm2) can be excluded from the quantification.\nPLA signal analysis\nIn this section, the number of PLA probe particles is counted on its corresponding binary mask. Then, a composite image containing both nuclei PLA spots is created, and the ratio between the PLA probe particles and the number of nuclei calculated.\n12. Apply a watershed transformation by selecting [Process > Binary > Watershed].\nThis step can be performed if the PLA signal overlaps, and thus the spots are difficult to resolve spatially (Fig. 7A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0007]).",
    "13. Count PLA probe particles >0.3 μm2 in the resulting PLA watershed image by selecting [Analyze > Analyze particles..] and setting the following parameters: Size (μm2), 0.3–10; Show, Outlines; and Display results.\nStudies have reported that PLA probe particles may exceed the size of 0.3 μm2 particles (Taura et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-bib-0030]).\n14. For visualization purposes, create a composite image that combines the projected DAPI and PLA channels by selecting [Image > Color > Merge channels…] and follow these steps:\n         \nSelect the MAX_PLA image as C1 (red)\nSelect the MAX_DAPI image as C3 (blue).\nSelect the Create composite option to generate the merged image (Fig. 7C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0007]).\nThis approach can be useful for presenting your results in a clear and concise manner.\n15. Obtain a quantitative measure of the PLA signal by calculating the ratio between the number of PLA probe particles and the number of nuclei present in the sample.\nDivide the number of PLA probe particles by the number of nuclei in the same image to obtain the desired ratio.\n16. Graph data that contain appropriate negative controls (Fig. 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-fig-0008]).\nTo establish several negative controls, it is essential to perform the same procedure under different conditions. Specifically, the procedure should be performed in the absence of primary antibodies as a negative control. Additionally, brain slices of the knockout animal should be used to verify the specificity of the staining for at least one of the targeted receptors. Lastly, defined negative brain regions that are expected to be devoid of targeted receptors should be used as negative controls as well.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f2b030aa-7855-4e0d-93ab-4d035f0086c4/cpz1794-fig-0008-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 8",
    "Representative P-LISA result. Illustrative images of dual recognition of D2R and A2AR P-LISA in the striatum and cortex of a wild-type animal (StriatumWT and CortexWT, respectively) and the striatum of a A2AR knockout animal (StriatumKO). The PLA signal in the striatum was significantly (***p < 0.001) higher than in the cortex or striatum of A2AR-KO mice. The values correspond to the mean ± s.e.m. (dots/nuclei) of at least 6 animals for condition. Adapted from (Fernández-Dueñas et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.794#cpz1794-bib-0008]).
