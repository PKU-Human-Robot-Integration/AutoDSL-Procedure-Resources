  "procedures": [
    "AMPylation reactionNote: This protocol requires use of radioactive α-32P-ATP. As such, all radioactive materials or materials in contact with them must be handled, stored, and disposed of in accordance with your institution’s radioactive safety guidelines. Radioactivity must be handled behind a radiation shield at all times. A Geiger counter should be used to constantly monitor work environment for radioactive contamination. Appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn at all times. Pipette calculated volume of ddH2O into designated 1.5 ml tubes.Pipette calculated volume of 10x AMPylation Buffer into designated 1.5 ml tubes.Note: Components of 10x AMPylation Buffer may be modified as needed to accommodate differing experimental conditions, such as enzymes, substrates, etc. Pipette 2 μg of purified, recombinant HYPE enzyme to designated 1.5 ml tubes.Notes: Reactions were performed at a final volume of 20 µl. The actual reaction amounts may be modified so long as a ≥ 10:1 molar substrate:enzyme ratio is maintained, and a detectable amount of each protein (i.e., ≥ 0.1 μg) is loaded onto the gel. All proteins are purified as previously described (Sanyal et al., 2019) and come dissolved in protein storage buffer. It is advisable to prepare twice the amount of required sample in case the gel needs to be rerun. Pipette 20 μg of purified, recombinant α-syn (or other substrate) into designated 1.5 ml tubes.Note: When performing kinetic experiments or comparing different substrates side-by-side, molar concentrations should be used in order to ensure that the relative numbers of molecules in the reaction are consistent. Pipette 2.5 μCi α-32P-ATP into designated 1.5 ml tubes.Notes: Reaction start time begins with α-32P-ATP addition. As α-32P-ATP is the only radioactive component, the other sample ingredients may be added at a standard lab bench, and samples can then be transported to a designated radioactive area for α-32P-ATP addition.",
    "Alternative concentrations of α-32P-ATP may be used depending on the catalytic efficiencies of the test enzyme and/or the freshness of the nucleotide. These concentrations should be determined empirically. AMPylation reactions should ideally occur within the first half-life (14.3 days) of α-32P-ATP. Incubate the samples in a heat block set to 30 °C for 30 min.Notes: Be sure to place the heat block behind a radiation shield. Different AMPylases may require different reaction temperatures or durations for optimal enzymatic activity. Samples may be snap-centrifuged for 5 s at 2,000 x g in order to consolidate any sample components not at the bottom of the tube. Quench reaction with an appropriate volume of 4x SDS Loading Buffer.Heat samples for 10 min at 95 °C on a heat block.Note: Ensure that tube lids are firmly closed to avoid lids popping open during heating. A weighted sample tray may be placed flatly over tube lids to prevent opening. Alternatively, MTC Stop-Pop locking tubes clips (MTC Bio, Inc.) could be used. Snap centrifuge samples for 5 s at 2,000 x g.SDS-PAGE separationCarefully remove well comb and green seal tape from precast gel cassette.Assemble gel cassette and tank according to manufacturers’ instructions.Note: Fresh 1x Running Buffer should be used inside of the gel cassette assembly, although used 1x Running Buffer may be used to fill the tank. Using gel loading pipette tips, carefully load 2-4 μl of protein ladder into the first lane.Using gel loading pipette tips, carefully load 10-30 μl of each sample into lanes adjacent to the first lane.Securely close tank lid.Run gel at constant  200  V for 45 min.",
    "Alternatively, better band resolution can be obtained by first running the gel at 80 V for ~30 min (until the samples clear the stacking layer), then ramping up to 120 V for ~1 h (until the dye front reaches the reference line on the gel cassette).Note: Ensure proper current flow via production of bubbles in the running buffer and migration of the dye front towards the bottom of the gel.Phosphor imagingCarefully remove gel using a cassette lever.Note: The gel is radioactive at this point and should be handled and disposed of in accordance with your institution’s regulations/guidelines for radioactive materials. Place gel in between a clean, plastic cover sheet. Smooth out any air bubbles in the gel.Place cover sheet with gel on top of the imaging side (white) of a clean Phosphor screen.Notes: Phosphor screen should be erased with the Phosphor screen eraser after each use to prevent signal contamination. Avoid touching the imaging side of the Phosphor screen, as this can damage the screen. Carefully place Phosphor screen and gel inside of the foam phosphor screen storage container.Expose the screen for 3 h at room temperature.Note: Duration of Phosphor screen exposure is dependent on the AMPylation reaction parameters and must therefore be determined empirically. Place the Phosphor screen imaging-face down in an imager.Note: Ensure imager screen is clear of debris before imaging, as these may mask sample signal. Kimwipes and ddH2O should be used to clean imager screen as needed. Open the Typhoon FLA 9500 software.Under “Mode Settings”, select the “Phosphorimaging” tab.Under “Reader Settings,” go to the “Method” dropdown tab and select “[Phosphor]” option.Note: The “[Phosphor]” option will be colored red and correspond to a wavelength of 673 nm. Under “Reader Settings,” go to “PMT” (Photo-multiplier Tube) and select a value between 250-1,000 V.",
    "Note: A PMT of 500 V is usually a good starting point to gauge band intensity; the higher the PMT, the stronger the signal. Under “Reader Settings,” go to “Area” and select the grid area corresponding to where the gel is placed on the screen. Alternatively, the entire screen may be imaged, but this takes additional time.Under “Reader Settings” go to “Pixel Size” and Select “50 μm” pixel size.Note: Lower or higher resolutions may be selected based on specific image quality needs. Select “Scan” to scan image.Select “Save As” to save image as a Tiff file in the appropriate folder.Coomassie stainingOnce exposure of the Phosphor screen to the gel is complete, incubate the gel in Coomassie Stain with a rocker set to low to medium speed for 10 min.Note: The amount of stain used will vary depending on the shape and dimensions of the container used for incubation but should be enough to fully immerse the gel. Pour off Coomassie Stain in its original container for reuse.Incubate gel in Destain on rocker for 30 min or until sufficient contrast between protein bands and gel background is established.Discard Destain in appropriate waste container.Scan gel on generic document scanner between cover sheet, or with phone camera or scanning application.Notes: Coomassie staining is done to control for protein loading, and should yield bands that validate experimental amounts of protein (see Figure 1, bottom). If reactions are set up using molar ratios instead of mass-based concentrations, the apparent band sizes may vary with the differing molecular weights of the proteins. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200917/20200917015140_7350.jpgFigure 1.
