    "All animal procedures were performed according to the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC). The protocol was approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of British Columbia (Protocol Number: A10-0192).\n1. Preparation of Cell Lines\nConfirm the identity of the respective human bladder cancer cell lines by DNA fingerprinting7.\nFor growth analysis of xenograft tumors by bioluminescence, transfect cell lines with a lentiviral construct carrying the firefly luciferase gene3.\nThaw and expand the existing cell lines in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Passage the cells at least 3x but avoid culture times exceeding 3 months.\n2. Preparation of Cell Suspension\nThaw Matrigel. Keep the temperature below 4 °C to avoid increased viscosity of the gel.\nTrypsinize the cells at a confluence of 70% and suspend in normal growth media.\nCount the cell number with a hemocytometer or automatic cell counter.\nSpin the cell suspension for 5 min at 200 x g. Remove the supernatant.\nAdd the appropriate volume of DMEM (10% FBS) and Matrigel (1:1 ratio) in order to reach the desired cell concentration which is dependent on the utilized cell line and desired growth kinetics (8-15 x 106/ml). The injected volume of tumor cell suspension will be 40 µl.\nMix well by pipetting up and down (P1000), avoid creating air bubbles in the suspension.\n3. Preparation of Animals\nNote: Due to the potential need for transurethral catheterization in step 4.7, female mice are the preferred gender in this animal model.\nHouse mice according to institutional and national animal care guidelines. Obtain ethics committee approval for all experiments involving mice.\nAnesthetize the mice with 3% isoflurane/oxygen mixture. Confirm proper anesthetization of animals (e.g. unresponsiveness to toe pinches).\n4. Experimental Setup",
    "Cut the bladder stabilization from any kind of flat rigid plastic material [Figure 2 I]. Carefully inspect the strap and remove any sharp edges before application to the mice.\nMount the animal on the heated imaging table [Figure 1 I] of the small animal imaging platform with continuous monitoring of vital signs. Fix the lower limbs with a rubber band [Figure 1 III].\nDisinfect the abdomen with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate and wipe the skin with a sterile cotton tip.\nImmobilize the bladder with the bladder stabilization strap [Figure 2 II]. Thus, an evasion of the bladder during intramural injection in step 5.6 will be avoided.\nApply sterile ultrasound gel to the lower abdomen.\nSlowly approach the ultrasound scanhead (frequency 40 MHz) [Figure 1 IV] to the skin (longitudinal with a cranial angle of 45-70°) and visualize the bladder on the ultrasound screen [Figure 3 I].\nIf the bladder is empty, fill it with 50 µl sterile, warm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) through a transurethral 24 G angiocatheter.\n5. Separation of Bladder Wall Layers\nAttach a 1.0 ml syringe filled with PBS and connected to a 30 G, ¾ in needle (bevel directed anteriorly) to the syringe clamp.\nPosition the needle towards the skin just above the pubic bone in a 30-45° angle (80-90° relative to the longitudinal axis of the ultrasound scanhead [Figure 1]).\nDetect the needle on the ultrasound screen.\nSlowly perforate the skin and the abdominal wall muscles [Figure 3 II].\nTurn the bevel of the needle 180° (now directed posteriorly).\nInsert the tip of the needle into the bladder wall without penetrating the mucosa [Figure 3 III]\nSlowly inject 50 µl of PBS between the muscular layer and the mucosa in order to create an artificial space [Figure 3 IV].",
    "Note: If the mucosa is accidently perforated during step 5.6, slowly pull back the needle and inject 50 µl of PBS after the mucosal layer has flipped back over the needle tip.\nWithdraw the needle.\n6. Intramural Inoculation of Bladder Cancer Cells\nAttach a second 1.0 ml syringe (filled with cancer cells suspended in Matrigel) with a 30 G, ¾ in needle to the syringe clamp.\nGuide the tip of the needle to the same PBS-filled space which was created in step 5.7.\nInject 40 µl of the cell suspension into this space [Figures 3 V and VI].\nWithdraw the needle.\n7. Post-interventional Supportive Care\nDismount the mouse from the imaging platform.\nKeep the animal in a warm and comfortable environment under continuous surveillance while recovering from the anesthetic.\nAfter regaining consciousness and resuming normal ambulation, place the animal back in its home cage."
