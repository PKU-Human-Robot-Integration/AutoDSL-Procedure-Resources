    "1. Preparing Glioblastoma Single Cell Suspension\nGliomasphere culture is established and maintained using the neurosphere assay (NSA) as previously described2,11,12.\nAt the appropriate time for passaging the gliomaspheres, the medium containing the spheres is removed, placed in an appropriate size sterile tissue culture tube, and centrifuged at 800 rpm (110 g) for 5 min at room temperature.\nThe supernatant is discarded and the pellet of spheres is resuspended in 1 ml of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA and incubated at 37 °C in a water bath for 3-5 min.\nAn equal volume of soybean trypsin inhibitor is then used to stop the trypsin activity.\nThe cell suspension is gently pipetted up and down to ensure homogeneity and complete neutralization of the trypsin activity.\nThe cell suspension is again centrifuged at 800 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant is removed and the cells are resuspended in 1ml of NeuroCult NSC Basal Medium.\n10μl of the single-cell suspension is mixed with 90μl of trypan blue to perform a cell count.\n2. Staining with Cell Trace Carboxyfluorescein Succinimidyl Ester (CFSE) Green Fluorescent Dye\nFor every 1 million cells to be stained, 1 ml of staining reagent is prepared by adding 1 μl of 5 mM Cell Trace CFSE dye (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) to 1 ml of NeuroCult NSC Basal Medium to give a final staining concentration of 5 μM.\nThe staining reagent containing the cells is mixed well until homogeneity and incubated at room temperature for 10 min.\nDuring the incubation, ice-cold NeuroCult NSC Basal Medium is prepared as the quenching solution. \nTo stop the staining process, approximately 5-10 volumes of ice-cold quenching solution is added to the CFSE-loaded cells.\nThe solution is then centrifuged at 800 rpm for 5 min and the supernatant is discarded.",
    "At this point, there should appear a pellet of cells at the bottom of the tube with a bright-green tint of color, indicating the staining was successful.\nThe cells are washed by resuspending the pellet in 1-2 ml of fresh NeuroCult NSC Basal Medium, centrifuging at 800 rpm for 5 min and discarding the supernatant. This procedure is repeated for a total of three washes.\nAfter the third wash, the cells are resuspended in 1 ml of NeuroCult NSC Basal Medium and a cell count is performed.\nThe CFSE stained cells are then plated in sterile tissue culture flasks at an appropriate density [50,000 cells/ml] and placed in a 37 °C / 5% CO2 humidified incubator.\n3. CFSE Loading Verification\nCells plated in NSA culture can be monitored under a fluorescent microscope to verify CFSE staining. At this stage, all of the cells exhibit bright green color (Figure 1). Alternatively, a drop of the cell suspension from CFSE stained cells could be placed on a microscope slide and covered with a coverslip to visualize cells under the fluorescent microscope. \nSuccessful CFSE labeling is further confirmed via flow cytometry. As many as 1-5 x 105 cells from each group is sufficient for CFSE staining verification. The CFSE loaded cells and unloaded negative control cells are resuspended respectively in 1 x -PBS or NeuroCult NSC Basal Medium for a total volume of 500 μl and placed in separate FACS tubes. \nThe flow cytometer is adjusted based on its user manual instructions for related parameters. CFSE has a wavelength excitation maximum of 492 nm and emission maximum of 517 nm.\nFirst, the unloaded control cells are run and the acquired events are recorded in forward and side scatter (FSC vs. SSC) and histogram plots, and the main cell population is gated (Figure 2A).",
    "Similarly, the CFSE loaded cells are analyzed using the same parameters used for control cells (Figure 2B). \n4. Isolation of the Slow-dividing [i.e. CFSE Retaining] Cell Population Using Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting (FACS)\nUpon division, CFSE intensity is decreased and hGBM cells form gliomaspheres that are composed of cells exhibiting different levels of green fluorescence intensity (Figure 3). When the gliomaspheres have reached an average size of approximately 150-200 μm in diameter (approximately 5 to 10 days post CFSE loading depending on the cell line growth rate), the medium containing the spheres is removed, placed in an appropriate size sterile tissue culture tube, and centrifuged at 800 rpm for 5 min at room temperature.\nA single-cell suspension is prepared as described in prior steps and the cells are resuspended in PBS for a cell count in order to prepare a cell suspension with a density up to 107 cells per milliliter. \nAfter resuspending the cells in an appropriate volume of PBS, Propidium Iodide (PI, Sigma, 500 μg/ml) is added at a concentration of 1 μl/ml of cell suspension to exclude dead cells when sorted/analyzed by flow cytometry.\nTwo 15 ml sterile tissue culture tubes each containing 1ml of complete NeuroCult NSC Medium is used to collect the sorted slow-dividing cells (CFSE retaining cells) and the fast dividing cells (CFSE diluting cells).\nFirst, the cell suspension from the unloaded cell group is run through the flow cytometer. \nThe cells (events) are plotted based on forward scatter (FSC) versus side scatter (SSC) and voltage parameters for both parameters are adjusted so that the majority of the cells are included in the flow plot.\nTo exclude dead or damaged cells, the cells are plotted based on SSC versus PI reactivity and the single live cell population (PI negative) is gated.",
    "Then, a homogeneous cell population is selected based on forward scatter (FSC) versus side scatter (SSC).\nThe homogeneous single live cell population is then plotted in a histogram based on cell frequency versus CFSE intensity set on a logarithmic scale. The CFSE laser intensity is adjusted in order to place the negative signal between 0 and 100.\nUsing the same parameters and a similar gating strategy, the CFSE labeled cells are run through the flow cytometer and analyzed (Figure 4C).\nSubsequently, a slow dividing population of cells and an overall population (faster dividing cells) are identified based on their ability to retain CFSE (CFSEhigh-top 5% and CFSElow-bottom 85%, respectively). \nThese different cell populations are then sorted into separate 15 ml sterile tissue culture tubes containing 1ml of complete NSC medium.\nSorted cells are then centrifuged at 800 rpm for 5 min.\nSupernatant is discarded and the pellet is resuspended in an appropriate volume of medium (depending on the number of isolated events or pellet size) and a cell count is performed.\nCells from the different sorted populations are then plated at 50,000 cells per milliliter in an appropriate sterile tissue culture flask and placed in a 37 °C / 5% CO2 humidified incubator for 5-10 days before being serially passaged or used for downstream experiments. \n5. Representative Results",
    "After CFSE loading, all the cells present an intense green fluorescence as visualized under the microscope (Figure 1). This green-tinted color can be seen even with the naked eye (see the video). Analyzing these cells with flow cytometry also shows highly intense green fluorescence compared to control cells (Figure 2). Upon plating CFSE loaded cells in neurosphere culture, these cells proliferate and form 150-200 μm gliomaspheres in 5-10 days. As the cells proliferate, the fluorescent dye is equally distributed between daughter cells upon divisions, leading to the halving of the fluorescence intensity with every cell division. Glioblastomas are functionally heterogeneous and are composed of cells proliferating on different time scales. The method described in this protocol enables one to identify and isolate fast and slow dividing cells by virtue of their ability to dilute or retain CFSE, respectively (Figure 3, also see the video).\nFlow cytometry analysis of dissociated gliomaspheres generated from CFSE-loaded cells in comparison to unloaded cells demonstrates diverse CFSE retention properties (Figure 4). Fast dividing cells (bottom 85%) or slow dividing cells (the top 5% - CFSEhigh) exhibit gliomapshere forming ability when cultured in the neurosphere assay conditions (Figure 5).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3918/3918fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.
