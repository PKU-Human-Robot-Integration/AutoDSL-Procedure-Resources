    "Biofilm formation assay on non-cell-treated polystyrene microtiter plates   Bacterial strains were grown overnight in sterile tubes containing 2 ml of Luria-Bertani broth with 5 g.L-1 glucose at 35.5 °C without agitation (Martinez-Medina et al., 2009; Chassaing and Darfeuille-Michaud, 2013).   The following day, bacterial suspension was diluted 1/100 in M63 minimal medium supplemented with 1 mM of MgSO4 and 8 g.L-1 glucose.   Aliquots of 130 μl were then placed in wells of non-cell-treated polystyrene 96-well microtiter plates and incubated 24 h at 30 °C without shaking. One well designed as blank received only M63 minimal medium supplemented with 1 mM of MgSO4 and 8 g.L-1 glucose without bacteria.   After incubation, microplates were agitated for 5 min using a microplate shaker, and bacterial growths were then estimated by OD620nm reading using a microplate spectrophotometer.   The liquid was remove by decantation, and the wells were washed once using 200 μl sterile PBS without agitation.   In order to dry them, plates were left open for at least 20 min at room temperature.   Adherent bacteria forming biofilm were stained with 130 μl of 1% crystal violet solubilized in ethanol for 5 min at room temperature without agitation.   Wells were then washed five times using 200 μl sterile PBS without agitation.   In order to dry them, plates were left open for at least 1 h at room temperature.   130 μl of absolute ethanol was added, and plates were incubated 5 min at room temperature without agitation.   High-speed agitation was performed using a microplate shaker for 10 min (1000 rpm).    Biofilm formation was estimated by OD570nm reading using a microplate spectrophotometer. 13.Specific biofilm formation index could be determined by using the ration OD570nm/OD620nm that allows standardization of biofilm formation according to bacterial growth in M63 minimal medium.",
    "According to previous publication, specific biofilm formation index of wild type AIEC strain LF82 should be between 2 and 4 (Martinez-Medina et al., 2009; Chassaing and Darfeuille-Michaud, 2013).      Biofilm formation assay on paraformaldehyde-fixed I-407 IEC monolayers Intestine-407 (I-407) cells were derived from human intestinal embryonic jejunum and ileum tissues. They were maintained in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Minimum Essential Medium supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum; 1% of nonessential amino acids; 1% of L-glutamine; 1% of Penicillin/Streptomycin/Amphotericin B solution and 1% of vitamin mix.   Monolayers were seeded on coverslip in 24-well tissue culture plates with 4 x 105 cells per well and incubated for 20 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2.   Monolayers were then washed once with 1ml PBS, fixed for 15 min in 4% formaldehyde (stock solution diluted in sterile PBS) at room temperature without agitation, and then washed 4 times with PBS.   Bacterial strains expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Valdivia et al., 1996) were prepared as previously described above, from step A1 to A2, in M63 minimal medium supplemented with 1 mM of MgSO4 and 8 g.L-1 glucose.   1 ml of this bacterial suspension was applied on the surface of fixed I-407 cell monolayers, and incubated overnight at 30 °C without shaking.   The liquid was removed by decantation, and the wells were washed 3 times using 1 ml of sterile PBS without incubation.   I-407/biofilm complex was then fixed for 15 min using 4% formaldehyde.   Phalloidin-tetramethyl rhodamine isocyanate was used to visualize actin and Hoechst 33258 was used to visualize nuclei. For this purpose, Phalloidin-tetramethyl rhodamine isocyanate was diluted in sterile PBS at a final concentration of 1μg/ml and Hoechst 33258 was added at a final concentration of 1μg/ml.",
    "This solution was added to the wells and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. After incubation, the wells were washed 5 times using 1 ml of sterile PBS without incubation.   Coverslips containing the fixed and stained I-407/biofilm complex were then removed from the 24-well plate and mounted on slide using Vectashield.   The slides were examined with a confocal microscope. An example of biofilm formation on paraformaldehyde-fixed I-407 IEC monolayers is presented Figure 1.   Images from biofilm formation assay at the surface of intestinal epithelial cells I-407 monolayers could be analyzed for thickness and/or roughness with the computer program COMSTAT1 (Haydorn et al., 2000).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20131204/20131204234958_9665.jpg Figure 1.
