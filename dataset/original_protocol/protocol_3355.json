    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSlide assembly\nTiming: ∼1 h\nFor this step, the single-molecule slide is assembled using the previously prepared slide and coverslip. Chambers are created within the slide by attaching the coverslip to the slide using double-sided tape and sealing the edges with epoxy. Each pair of pre-drilled holes will serve as an inlet and an outlet for each chamber within the slide.\nWarm the slide to 20°C–25°C for 15 min.\nTear off a 10 cm strip of double-sided tape and place on a glass plate or other sterile surface.\nUse a clean razor blade to cut the tape into 6–8 10 cm-long strips.\nCarefully remove the slide from the conical tube and place the PEGylated side face-up on a glass plate.\nMark the coverslip with a sharpie to denote the PEGylated or non-PEGylated side of the coverslip.\nNote: If it is unclear which side of the slide is PEGylated, one can gently pipet distilled water onto each side of the slide. The PEGylated side will have less surface tension and the water will move around more easily when the slide is tilted. The coverslip can then be dried with a nitrogen gas stream or air dried before continuing to assemble the slide.\nLift a tape strip and apply the strip to the slide between each pair of drilled holes and along the outer edge of the first and final pair of holes.\nUse a pipet tip to gently secure the tape onto the slide.\nRemove the coverslip and place it on the taped slide.\nNote: The PEGylated side of the coverslip and the slide should be facing each other.\nSeal the slide and coverslip by gently pressing with a pipet tip.\nCut the excess tape on each end of the slide using a razor blade.",
    "Seal the outer edges of the slide and coverslip by applying quick-drying epoxy with a pipet tip.\nCritical: Be careful not to apply too much epoxy or it will flow too far into the lane and will block that channel.\nAllow the epoxy to dry for 20 min before use.\nPause point: Single-molecule slides can be assembled in advance. Store assembled slides in vacuum-sealed bags at ‒20°C.\nSingle molecule pull-down\nTiming: ∼1 h\nThis method uses cells expressing the fluorescently-tagged protein of interest for pull-down onto the single-molecule slide. Photobleaching the singly-tagged proteins will then report on the oligomerization status of the complex. Additional reagents can be applied to the isolated complexes as desired. If cell stress conditions are desired, treat cells with cell stressor or stress condition prior to the pull-down experiment.\nSet up the TIRF microscope for the single molecule pull-down experiment.\nTurn the camera on.\nEnsure that appropriate laser(s) are on.\nOpen IDL for single-molecule trace processing.\nNote: Single-molecule slide and cell lysis will be prepared simultaneously.\nOptional: Treat cells with stress condition prior to cell lysis if this is applicable to the experiment.\nTake Petri dish from incubator.\nDecant or aspirate media from Petri dish and discard.\nRinse Petri dish with 1 mL ice cold 1X dPBS and discard.\nAdd 1 mL ice cold cell lysis buffer to Petri dish and incubate on ice.\nWhile cells are lysing, prepare single-molecule slide for pull-down.\nApply 30 μL neutravidin diluted in T50 buffer at a 20 μg/μL concentration to one channel within the slide and incubate for ∼2 min.\nApply 50 μL T50 buffer to rinse off unbound neutravidin.\nApply 30 μL biotin-conjugated GFP antibody at a 5 μg/mL concentration after diluting 1 mg/mL stock antibody in T50 buffer to the slide and incubate for ∼2 min.",
    "Apply 50 μL T50 buffer to rinse off unbound antibody.\nNote: By this point, cells will have been lysed for ∼5 min. Cell lysis time can be adjusted accordingly depending on type of cells used.\nPlace lysed cells in Petri dish into microcentrifuge tube and pipet several times to further lyse.\nPrepare a dilution of cell lysis in T50 buffer.\nNote: Cell lysates can be diluted to 1:100-1:1000 and should be optimized accordingly such that a surface density of ∼100–300 molecules is obtained on the single-molecule surface (2,500 μm2 imaging area). Gentle cell lysis has been confirmed using western blot to ensure effectiveness of cell lysis and extraction of nuclear and cytosolic proteins. Cell lysates are not centrifuged and are pipetted gently to ensure minimal condensate disruption.\nApply 50 μL diluted cell lysate onto the slide and incubate for ∼2 min.\nApply 50 μL T50 buffer to rinse off unbound complexes.\nSet up slide on TIRF microscope.\nApply water to the objective on the TIRF microscope.\nPlace the single-molecule slide on the objective with the coverslip facing down.\nClean the prism with 100% ethanol.\nApply 1 drop of immersion oil to the prism and attach the prism to the microscope so that the oil surface is touching the slide.\nAdjust the beam alignment for TIRF imaging.\nOptimize the gain, exposure time, laser intensity, and z-plane focus for imaging the single-molecule surface. Settings are optimal when single molecule spots are detectable on the surface with minimal background, and with proper cell density to prevent under- or over-saturation.\nAcquire 6–10+ videos capturing 600 frames at 100 ms/frame acquisition speed in different fields of view at maximum laser intensity in the excitation channel corresponding to the tagged protein.\nCritical: Perform a photobleaching control with the fluorescent tag alone.\nOligomer dissolution\nTiming: ∼1 h",
    "Once fluorescently-tagged proteins are effectively pulled down using the method described above, additional reagents can be added to promote complex disassembly. Robust dissolution agents will result in an increase in monomer population of complexes and a decrease in higher-order oligomers. Dissolution experiments require obtaining photobleaching steps before and after treatment with dissolving agent. Once fluorescently-tagged proteins have been successfully pulled down and photobleaching steps acquired as described in the steps above, the following steps can be taken using the same channel.\nCarefully pipet 50 μL of dilution reagent at desired concentration into the channel and incubate for ∼2–10 min.\nNote: Concentration and incubation time of dilution reagent should be optimized for the experimental condition desired.\nPerform two washes with 50 μL T50 buffer to remove dissolving reagent and unbound complexes from the slide.\nOptional: Slide can be removed from the TIRF microscope to add dissolving agent and perform T50 washes. In this case, clean slide and prism with a Kimwipe and 100% ethanol to remove excess oil. Gently wipe microscope objective with lens paper to remove excess water. Then proceed with adding dilution reagents and performing T50 buffer washes. Set up the slide on the TIRF microscope as previously described in Step 28.\nObtain photobleaching steps of fluorescently-tagged proteins.\nAcquire 6–10+ videos capturing 600 frames at 100 ms/frame acquisition speed in different fields of view at maximum laser intensity in the excitation channel corresponding to the tagged protein.\nCritical: Maintain the same gain, exposure time, laser intensity, and z-plane focus for imaging the single-molecule surface and obtaining photobleaching steps."
