    "Tissue preparation There is nothing unique about this section compared to methods common in most            rodent neuroscience laboratories. Please see Gage et al. (2012) for a            detailed protocol with videos. There is no particular peristaltic pump            required; modify the general recommendations below based on the            manufacturer’s instructions for your pump.Prepare animal and environmentWeigh the animal.Prepare 1× PBS for flushing the system, fixative                    solution, as well as an anesthetic cocktail based on your                    animal use protocol. We used ketamine (80 mg/kg) and                    xylazine (10 mg/kg).Flush your peristaltic pump with PBS. We use PBS.  CAUTION:  Ensure no bubbles are visible in any of the                    tubing. If you see any bubbles, continue to flush until all                    bubbles are gone. Stop the flow of PBS and ensure that you                    can see a protruding meniscus is at the end of the tube                    before transferring the intake tube to the fixative solution                    to avoid a bubble.Perfuse animal (at room temperature)Anesthetize the animal based on your animal care                    requirements. We used 3% isoflurane in oxygen. Once the                    animal is asleep, administer the anesthetic cocktail. Wait                    and ensure the animal is in a deep, surgical plane of                    anesthesia following your animal care requirements.Make an incision under the ribcage across the animal’s                    abdomen. Separate the liver and diaphragm. Cut the                    diaphragm. Then, cut the ribs on either side. Be careful not                    to harm the heart or lungs; use a hemostat to hold the                    ribcage and slowly pull up and away from the body towards                    the head to expose the heart and lungs.Insert a 15 gauge needle into the posterior left ventricle.                    You may snip the area with scissors if the needle does not                    easily puncture the ventricle. You may clamp the needle in                    place, either over the aorta or at the incision site.",
    "Use scissors to snip the animal’s right atrium only.Begin perfusing PBS through the animal. Adjust the needle if                    needed [see Gage et al. (2012) and troubleshooting tip 1 for                    details]. Run until the liver loses its color and the fluid                    exiting the right ventricle is clear; this should be                    approximately 200 mL.Switch the perfusion solution from PBS to fixative. The                    animal may twitch; this is expected. After 200 mL of                    fixation fluid, the animal should feel stiff all over. You                    can make your own fixative solution, but we purchased 4%                    paraformaldehyde in PBS.Extract brainRemove the head with scissors or a guillotine.Use scissors to trim muscles and to expose the skull by                    making an incision from the neck to the face.Carefully remove the skull with rongeurs. If the skull chips                    into pieces, the edges can damage your sample. Take care to                    avoid this.Use a spatula, a surgical blade, or small scissors to sever                    the nerves around the edges of the brain until it comes                    free.Place brain in fixative solution in a 15–20 mL                    Eppendorf or scintillation vial overnight (10–24 h).                    Use vials made of either glass or polypropylene.Wash brainWash brain with 1× PBS three times for 30 min each,                    rocking or shaking at room temperature.OPTIONAL:  Samples can be stored in PBS for 3                    days or less at 4 °C.Tissue processing (uDISCO, Figure 1A) You should follow either A (uDISCO) or B (iDISCO, below) but            not both. To transfer the brains to a new solution, you may reuse the same            vial throughout unless otherwise noted. To do this, we recommend decanting            the current solution without decanting the brain, then filling the vial with            the next solution until the brain is floating and completely covered. We            used glass scintillation vials, but polypropylene is also acceptable.",

Inverting (not rocking) several times                    (ideally every 30 min but can be flexible between                    15–45 min).Carefully wipe with 70% (or higher) ethanol in water to                    remove any solution on the exterior of the vial or tube.Cleared brains can be stored indefinitely at room temperature                    or 4 °C. We recommend 4 °C for long-term storage.Tissue processing (iDISCO, Figure 1A) You should follow either A (uDISCO, above) or B (iDISCO) but not both. To            transfer the brains to a new solution, you may reuse the same vial            throughout unless otherwise noted.

    "Transfer brain to a fresh tube or vial of 100% DBE at room                    temperature and wipe outside of tube or vial with 70% or                    greater ethanol.Samples can be stored indefinitely in DBE at room temperature                    or 4 °C without rocking. We recommend 4 °C in the                    dark for long-term storage and ensuring minimal air in the                    vial.Imaging the sample: Imaging details will depend on your microscope and              experimental goals Examples could include using higher magnification (at least 4×) for            counting labeled cell centers, or lower (1.1×) for general imaging of            gross anatomy to, for example, make a common coordinate system or identify a            probe’s location. You will likely need to use tiles to cover the entire brain. We recommend at least 20% overlap for all tiles            to assist the fusion and alignment process later. Also see Pisano et al.            (2022).Set up the microscope with appropriate filters. For autofluorescence,                shorter wavelengths provide more information. We recommend 488 nm                excitation, 525 nm emission (or lower wavelengths). Ensure the                light-sheets are aligned according to the manufacturer’s                specifications. This process will be slightly different for every                microscope, so please check your manual before proceeding.Don gloves and ensure you are not using any plastic items unless you                are sure they are compatible with the chemicals in use.Add the refractive index matched solution (BABB-D15 for uDISCO or DBE                for iDISCO) to the microscope chamber according to the                manufacturer’s instructions. Take care, as some microscopes                will not be compatible and either solution could melt some plastics.Clean the brain holder (custom 3D-printed or manufacturer-provided)                with ethanol and let dry. Place a cleared brain onto a paper towel,                then use the smallest possible amount of super glue to affix the                brain to the holder.",
    "We typically super glue either the brainstem or                olfactory bulbs, depending on project needs (Figure S2).Insert the brain into the solution in the microscope.Image the brain: turn on lasers, camera, stage, and software. We                recommend using 20% overlap or greater for tiles. We also recommend                imaging with the smallest axis parallel to the detection axis (the                objective) and perpendicular to the light-sheets (such that the left                light-sheet enters the left side of the brain, the right light-sheet                enters the right side of the brain, and the objective images the  z-axis from dorsal to ventral).After acquisition, remove the brain, and replace it back in DBE or                BABB-D15. Power off all items, clean thoroughly.Some imaging platforms will automatically blend the light-sheets or                stitch the tiles to create single z planes. Often, this is                sufficient, but acquiring raw data before blending and stitching is                recommended in case these steps are suboptimal and need to be                repeated.Create a 3D volume: there are many tools available for these steps We provide free code to handle images from either LaVision Ultrascope II or            SmartSPIM microscopes. However, the code can be altered to allow for            alternative inputs.On a cluster, run either:spim_downsize_n_register.sh providing the required inputs:                    the path to the main image folder, the registration channel                    subfolder name, and the cell channel subfolder name. If you                    only have one channel imaged, just repeat the registration                    channel folder name.sub_registration.shAlign to the Princeton RAtlas This section assumes you have already installed all the necessary software.
