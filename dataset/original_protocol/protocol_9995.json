  "procedures": [
    "All methods described here pertaining to the use of hESCs have been approved by the Human Gamete, Embryo and Stem Cell Research (GESCR) Committee at the University of California San Francisco.\n1. Preparation of silicon wafer with geometric features\nCreate a photomask with desired geometric features. Use computer-aided drafting software to design the features. For use with negative photoresist, make features opaque and the remainder of the mask transparent.\n\tNOTE: For patterning onto 18 mm diameter coverslips, group features for each experimental condition into 10 x 10 mm areas to ensure the stencils generated in Step 3 fit onto the coverslips.\nSpin coat negative photoresist onto a 100 mm silicon wafer. Use the photoresist data sheet to determine the speed and length of spin to generate a film thickness of 100-250 µm.\n\tNOTE: The film thickness should be adjusted such that the aspect ratio of the width of the patterns to the height of the stencil is as close to 1:1 as possible. However, we recommend a minimum thickness of 100 µm, as anything less produces delicate stencils that easily tear.\nProcess the photoresist according to the product data sheet. This typically involves a soft bake, UV exposure with photomask in a mask aligner, post exposure bake, development, and hard bake. As an example, the procedure used to process the wafers used in this protocol is outlined in Table 1.\n\tNOTE: Be cautious when handling silicon wafers as they are fragile. Once generated, wafers can be used repeatedly as long as they are not damaged.\n2. Preparation of coverslips\nPreparation of acid-washed \"top\" coverslips",
    "Place 18 mm diameter #1 thickness coverslips into a glass Petri dish. The appropriate number of coverslips depends on the size of the dish. For a 100 mm dish, prepare 50-100 coverslips at a time. Volume amounts given through the remainder of this section correspond to a 100 mm dish.\nAdd 20 mL of 1 M HCl to the Petri dish and gently shake the dish to disperse the coverslips. Ensure all the coverslips are submerged and release air bubbles from between the coverslips. Incubate overnight at room temperature with gentle shaking.\n\t\tCAUTION: HCl is acidic and corrosive. Use caution and wear appropriate PPE while working with HCl.\nDecant HCl from the dish. Add 20 mL of ultrapure water and wash with gentle shaking for 10 min. Discard water and repeat for a total of five washes.\nAfter discarding the final wash, add 20 mL of 100% ethanol to the dish. Using forceps, remove the coverslips individually and arrange between two pieces of filter paper to dry.\nStore dried coverslips in a sealed container. Acid-washed coverslips can be prepared in advance and stored for a month or longer in dust-free conditions.\nPreparation of glutaraldehyde-activated \"bottom\" coverslips\n\tNOTE: Refer to previous methods for additional details7,9.\n\t\nPlace 18 mm diameter #1 thickness coverslips into a Petri dish.\nAdd 20 mL of 0.2 M HCl to the petri dish and gently shake the dish to disperse the coverslips. Ensure all the coverslips are submerged and release air bubbles from between the coverslips. Incubate overnight at room temperature with gentle shaking.\nDecant HCl from the dish. Add 20 mL of ultrapure water and wash with gentle shaking for 10 min. Discard water and repeat for a total of five washes.",
    "After discarding the final wash, add 20 mL of 0.1 M NaOH and shake gently to disperse and submerge coverslips. Incubate at room temperature with gentle shaking for 1 h.\nDecant NaOH from the dish. Add 20 mL of ultrapure water and wash with gentle shaking for 10 min. Discard water and repeat for a total of five washes.\nAfter discarding the final wash, add 20 mL of a 1:200 dilution of 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane in ultrapure water and shake gently to disperse and submerge coverslips. Incubate at room temperature with gentle shaking for 1 h or overnight.\n\t\tCAUTION: 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane is flammable and can cause skin irritation. Handle with care, wear appropriate PPE, and discard waste according to local disposal regulations.\nDecant the diluted 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane solution from the dish. Add 20 mL of ultrapure water and wash with gentle shaking for 10 min. Discard water and repeat for a total of at least five washes. It is critical to remove all 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane before proceeding.\nAfter discarding the final wash, add 20 mL of a 1:140 dilution of 70% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and shake gently to disperse and submerge coverslips. Incubate at room temperature with gentle shaking for 1 h or overnight.\n\t\tCAUTION: 70% glutaraldehyde is toxic and can cause skin irritation. Handle with care, wear appropriate PPE, and discard waste according to local disposal regulations.\nDecant the diluted glutaraldehyde solution from the dish. Add 20 mL of ultrapure water and wash with gentle shaking for 10 min. Discard water and repeat for a total of five washes.\nAfter discarding the final wash, add 20 mL of 100% ethanol. Using forceps, remove the coverslips individually and arrange between two pieces of filter paper to dry.",
    "Store dried coverslips in a sealed container. Glutaraldehyde-activated coverslips can be prepared in advance and stored for up to six months.\n3. Generation of stencils for patterning ECM ligand\nGenerating polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) intermediate stamps\nMix PDMS base with PDMS curing agent at a 10:1 ratio, by weight. Mix thoroughly.\n\t\tNOTE: For the initial application of PDMS, prepare approximately 100 g of PDMS to fill a 100 mm dish. For subsequent applications, remove PDMS from only the center of the dish where the silicon wafer features are located and prepare 20-30 g of new PDMS.\nDegas the PDMS mixture in a desiccator for 30-60 min or until all air bubbles are removed.\nPlace the modified silicon wafer from Step 1 into a plastic 100 mm dish. Slowly and evenly pour the PDMS mixture over the surface of the wafer. Tap the dish on the work surface to release any air bubbles from the surface of the wafer.\nDegas the PDMS mixture poured over the wafer for 10 min or until all air bubbles are removed or have come to the surface of the PDMS.\nBake the PDMS at 70 °C for 2 h. Allow to cool to room temperature.\nUsing a scalpel or box cutter, cut out the section of PDMS from the center of the dish that contains the geometric features.\nCut the PDMS into roughly 10 x 10 mm squares, each containing the features for a single experimental condition. These are referred to as \"stamps\" in subsequent steps of the protocol.\nGenerating flat slabs of PDMS\nMix PDMS base with PDMS curing agent at an 8:1 ratio, by weight. Prepare approximately 20 g for each 100 mm dish to be used. Mix thoroughly.",
    "Degas the PDMS mixture in a desiccator for 30-60 min or until all air bubbles are removed.\nSlowly and evenly pour the PDMS into a clean 100 mm dish. Tap the dish on the work surface to release any air bubbles.\nBake the PDMS at 70 °C for 2 h. Allow to cool to room temperature.\nRemove the PDMS from the dish. Invert such that the surface of the PDMS that was in contact with the bottom of the dish is facing up.\nFor each stamp generated in Step 3.1, cut a 15 x 15 mm square of PDMS. These are referred to as \"flat slabs\" in subsequent steps of the protocol.\nGenerating stencils\nArrange flat slabs of PDMS on the lid of a 150 mm dish, or other flat surface for easier handling. Ensure sufficient spacing between slabs (e.g., for a 150 mm dish, arrange nine flat slabs with even spacing).\nInvert each stamp generated in Step 3.1 onto a flat slab of PDMS, such that the features on the stamp are in contact with the flat slab of PDMS. Gently press on the top of the stamp with forceps to ensure even contact.\nCarefully prop the lid holding PDMS stamp/slab pairs up on the base of the dish, such that the lid rests at an angle. This assists the wicking of the UV-curable polymer in the next step.\nPlace a small drop of UV-curable polymer at the top interface of each stamp/slab pair. The polymer will be wicked between the two by surface tension, assisted by gravity.",
    "NOTE: Many different UV-curable polymers may work in this protocol. We selected Norland Optical Adhesive 74 for the following properties: i) Fast curing upon exposure to UV light, ii) Easy removal from PDMS stamps upon curing, iii) Robust adhesion to glass coverslips with manual pressure.\nOnce the polymer has been completely wicked through, place the lid with stamp/slab pairs flat on the work surface. Place a small drop of UV-curable polymer at each of the remaining three sides of each stamp/slab interface.\nUsing a 200 µL pipette tip, connect the drops of polymer around the edges of the stamp/slab interface. This creates a border that will hold ligand solution in Step 4.\n\t\tNOTE: Be careful when working the polymer around the edges of the stamp. If the stamp/slab interface is disrupted, the polymer will wick underneath the features and the stencil will not form properly.\nCarefully place the stamp/slab pairs into a UV-sterilization box. Use the sterile \"Str\" power setting and expose for 10 min.\nRemove the stamp/slab pairs from the UV-sterilization box. Using two pairs of forceps, gently remove the PDMS stamp while holding down the flat slab and stencil that formed from the UV-curable polymer.\nUsing forceps, carefully remove the stencil and invert it such that the surface that was in contact with the flat slab of PDMS is facing up.\n\t\tNOTE: The stencils are delicate. Be careful while handing them, especially while initially removing them from the PDMS, so that they do not tear.\nPlace the inverted stencils back into a UV-sterilization box. Use the sterile \"Str\" power setting and expose for 3 min.\n4. Patterning ECM ligand on coverslips\nPressing stencils onto acid-washed coverslips\nPlace one acid-washed coverslip for each stencil onto a clean piece of laboratory film.",
    "Using forceps, carefully place each stencil, flat-side-down, onto an acid-washed coverslip. Place such that features are centered on the coverslip.\nPlace a small piece of laboratory film on top of each stencil. Firmly and evenly press down on the stencil to create strong contact between the stencil and the coverslip.\n\t\tNOTE: This is a critical step! Press firmly and across the entire surface of the stencil. If sufficient contact is not created, the ligand solution will leak between the stencil and the coverslips and the patterning will fail. OPTIONAL: To confirm sufficient contact between the stencil and the coverslip, pipette 100 µL of ultrapure sterile water onto the surface of each stencil and incubate at room temperature. After 1 h, check for leaking. Aspirate water from successfully bonded stencils and proceed.\nPlasma cleaning the surface of the stenciled coverslips to increase hydrophilicity\nPlace the coverslips with stencils into a plasma cleaner. Apply high power plasma for 30 s.\nPreparation of ECM ligand solution\n\tNOTE: All subsequent steps should be completed in sterile conditions, if possible.\n\t\nPlace sterile 100 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, pH 8.0 solution on ice. Once ice cold, add matrigel and collagen to achieve concentrations of 225 µg/mL and 25 µg/mL, respectively. OPTIONAL: For troubleshooting or for ligand visualization, include a fluorescently tagged ligand in the ligand solution.\n\t\t\nNOTE: Different ECM ligands can be used with this method. For different ligands, additional optimization may be required to determine ideal concentration, incubation time, and incubation temperature. See discussion section for more information.\nPipette the ligand solution onto the surface of each stencil. For stencils made from 10 x 10 mm square stamps, apply 100 µL per stencil.",
    "Check for air bubbles in stencil features. If necessary, use fine-tipped forceps or a 2 µL pipette tip to remove air bubbles from features.\n\t\tNOTE: This is a critical step! If air bubbles remain trapped at the surface of the coverslip, the ligand will not adsorb to the surface and the resulting pattern will be incomplete.\nPlace the stenciled coverslips with ligand into a dish, wrap with laboratory film, and incubate at 4 °C overnight.\n5. Transfer of ligand to polyacrylamide gel\nRemoving ligand solution and stencil from each coverslip\nAspirate the ligand solution from the surface of a stencil. Ligand solution can be collected and stored at 4 °C and reused for up to a month.\nUsing forceps, briefly submerge the coverslip with stencil into a dish containing sterile PBS to wash.\nBriefly submerge the coverslip with stencil into a second dish of sterile PBS to wash.\nRemove the stencil from the surface of the coverslip. Be careful to not break the coverslip.\nBriefly submerge the coverslip into a dish containing ultrapure sterile water to remove salts from the PBS washes. Tap the edge of the coverslip to a delicate task wipe to wick away excess water.\nDry the coverslip under an inert gas, such as nitrogen. Mark the underside of the coverslip to keep track of orientation from this point forward. Be careful to keep the patterned side facing up.\nRepeat steps 5.1.1 through 5.1.6 for each stenciled coverslip.\nMaking polyacrylamide hydrogels with patterned coverslips",
    "NOTE: Refer to previous methods for additional details7,9  Sterilize all cap holders, tubes, and spacers used to make polyacrylamide gels by washing with 10% bleach overnight, rinsing with water at least five times to remove bleach, and washing briefly in 70% ethanol. Place all pieces on delicate task wipes in a sterile biosafety cabinet to dry before use.\n\t\nPrepare polyacrylamide solution to obtain desired hydrogel elasticity (Table 2). Mix together all components except the fluorescent microspheres and the potassium persulfate (PPS).\n\t\tNOTE: Prepare 1% potassium persulfate solution fresh each time.\nDegas the polyacrylamide solution, microspheres, and PPS in separate tubes under vacuum for 30 min.\nFor each patterned coverslip, prepare a glutaraldehyde-activated \"bottom\" coverslip with a spacer (18 mm outer diameter, 14 mm inner diameter) placed on top.\nAfter degassing, briefly sonicate microspheres and add appropriate volume to polyacrylamide solution. Mix by pipetting up and down, being careful not to introduce air bubbles. Briefly sonicate.\nAdd appropriate volume of PPS to the polyacrylamide solution. Pipette up and down to mix the solution, being careful not to introduce air bubbles.\n\t\tNOTE: After adding PPS, work rapidly to complete steps 5.2.6 through 5.2.11 before polyacrylamide polymerizes.\nPipette 75-150 µL (depending on thickness of spacer) to the center of each glutaraldehyde-activated coverslip.\nUsing forceps, place a patterned coverslip onto each glutaraldehyde-activated coverslip with polyacrylamide and spacer, such that the patterned ligand faces the polyacrylamide solution. If sufficient polyacrylamide solution was added, surface tension will wick the polyacrylamide between the two coverslips and no air bubbles will be present.\nPick up each polyacrylamide \"sandwich\" and carefully touch the side to a delicate task wipe to wick away excess polyacrylamide solution.",
    "Carefully place each polyacrylamide \"sandwich\" into a cap holder with threads that are compatible with 15 mL conical-bottom tubes. The orientation should be such that the bottom of the glutaraldehyde coverslip is in contact with the bottom of the cap holder, and the patterned coverslip is on top.\nScrew a 15 mL conical-bottom tube into each cap holder to hold the polyacrylamide \"sandwiches\" in place. The tubes should be tight to prevent leaking, but be careful to not overtighten and crack the coverslips.\nCentrifuge the polyacrylamide \"sandwiches\" in the tubes in swing-buckets at 200 x g for 10 min at room temperature. Remove the tubes from the centrifuge and place in tube racks to maintain orientation for an additional 50 min to ensure full polymerization. Keep covered with foil to prevent bleaching of fluorescent microspheres.\n\t\tNOTE: Centrifugation is critical when using this method to perform TFM. The centrifugal force moves all the microspheres to a single plane, which will ultimately be just below the surface of the hydrogel. This is ideal for imaging microsphere displacements that are used to calculate cell-generated traction stresses. If not performing TFM, microspheres can be left out of the polyacrylamide solution and polymerization can occur at the benchtop without centrifugation.\nRemove polymerized polyacrylamide \"sandwiches\" from the tubes and submerge in PBS in a 100 mm dish. Wrap in laboratory film and incubate for 3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C.\nPreparation of patterned gels for seeding cells\nUse a scalpel and forceps to carefully remove the patterned coverslip and the spacer from the polyacrylamide \"sandwich\" while it remains submerged in PBS. The patterned ligand will have transferred to the polyacrylamide during polymerization and will remain after removing the coverslip. The polyacrylamide gel will remain attached to the glutaraldehyde-activated coverslip.",
    "NOTE: This is a critical step! The polyacrylamide must be submerged in PBS while removing the coverslip or the ligand patterns will be destroyed.\nPlace each coverslip with patterned polyacrylamide into a cap holder. Place a gasket (18 mm outer diameter, 14 mm inner diameter) on top of the coverslip and around the polyacrylamide, where the spacer was located. Screw a sawed-off 15 mm conical-bottom tube into the cap holder, forming a well with the patterned polyacrylamide at the bottom. These assemblies fit into the wells of a standard 12-well plate for easy handling.\nWash each gel by adding 500 µL of PBS to the well assembly. Incubate for 10 min at room temperature with gentle shaking. Remove PBS and repeat twice for a total of three washes.\nAfter the final PBS wash, add 500 µL of knockout-DMEM media to gels and incubate at 37 °C overnight. Gels can be kept at 37 °C with media for up to 5 days before seeding cells.\nThe day before seeding cells, replace knockout-DMEM for complete KSR media and incubate at 37 °C overnight.\n6. Culturing hESCs on patterned gels\nNOTE: If planning to fix samples for immunostaining after TFM, take images of unstressed microsphere positions prior to seeding cells. In this case, fluorescently tagged ligand should be used in step 4.3.1 so that the eventual locations of cells will be known before seeding and microspheres can be imaged in those regions.\nMaintain stock hESC cultures and secondary feeder-free cultures prepared on matrigel-coated plates in conditioned KSR media prior to seeding on patterned polyacrylamide gels as previously described9.\n\tNOTE: Generate conditioned KSR media by culturing irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts in KSR media supplemented with 4 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Collect and replace media every 24 h.",
    "Aspirate the media from hESCs. Briefly wash with knockout-DMEM media. Add 0.05% trypsin-EDTA supplemented with 10 µM Y27632 (Rho kinase inhibitor) and incubate at 37 °C for 5-10 min.\nAdd media with serum to inhibit trypsin. Gently aspirate media and pipette over the dish to remove cells. Continue pipetting gently to remove all cells and dissociate cell clusters to single cells.\nCollect the cell suspension and centrifuge at 200 x g for 3 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in an equivalent volume of KSR media to wash. Centrifuge at 200 x g for 3 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in conditioned KSR media supplemented with 10 ng/mL bFGF and 10 µM Y27632.\nCount the cells with a hemocytometer and adjust the cell suspension to a concentration of 300,000 cells per mL. Pipette 500 µL of the cell suspension onto each patterned gel (150,000 cells per gel).\n3 h after seeding, use a pipette to carefully aspirate the media from each gel and replace with fresh conditioned KSR media supplemented with 10 ng/mL bFGF and 10 µM Y27632. This removes excess cells that did not adhere to patterned regions of the polyacrylamide.\n\tNOTE: This is a critical step! At this stage cells will be loosely adhered to the patterned ligand. Be very careful when swapping media to not detach the cells. Equal care should be taken with each of the media swaps in the subsequent steps.\n24 h after seeding, use a pipette to carefully aspirate the media and exchange for conditioned KSR media supplemented with 10 ng/mL bFGF and 5 µM Y27632.",
    "48 h after seeding, use a pipette to carefully aspirate the media and exchange for conditioned KSR media supplemented with 10 ng/mL bFGF. This removes the Rho kinase inhibitor from the media and experiments can begin the next day, 72 h after seeding.\n7. Performing TFM\nWhen desired, perform TFM as previously described9 under desired experimental conditions.\nIf unstressed microsphere positions were imaged before seeding cells, fix the cells after taking stressed microsphere positions and perform immunostaining to determine localization of proteins of interest relative to regions of high and low traction forces.\nSubscription Required.
