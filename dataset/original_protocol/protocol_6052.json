    "For determination of cell uptake of particles using YOYO-1 labeled plasmidPrepare YOYO-1 labeled plasmid by taking pSPCas9 (Addgene, px165) at 1 mg/ml in molecular biology grade water and adding 20 μM YOYO-1, such that there is 1 dye molecule per 50 bp of DNA. For example, for a 1 ml total volume, add 1 mg plasmid and 25.4 μg YOYO-1.Prepare cells 24 h before uptake studies, by seeding 5 x 104 cells/well, for example, HEK293T, per well in a 24-well plate. Load YOYO-1 labeled plasmid into delivery vehicle (e.g., combine 30:1 PPABLG to plasmid by adding 30 μg of PPABLG to 1 μg of plasmid and let sit on ice for 15 min).Add particles from Step A3 to each well with a total volume of 500 μl of 1 μg sgRNAs/ml OptiMEM.Remove culture medium from the 24-well plate, replace with 500 μl OptiMEM and delivery vehicle containing fluorescently-tagged nucleic acid. Incubate for 4 h.Wash the cells three times with 500 μl/well cold PBS containing heparin (20 U/ml) each to remove externally-associated fluorescently-tagged nucleic acid.Apply 500 μl of RIPA lysis buffer and collect lysate.Use fluorescence spectrophotometer at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm to get specific fluorescence intensity of each lysate. Use a standard curve of labeled plasmid to correlate fluorescence intensity of lysate to ng of plasmid.Perform BCA assay to determine the total protein concentration of lysate.Cellular uptake level is then presented as ng YOYO-1 labeled plasmid per mg protein.For determination of cell uptake of particles using FITC-labeled sgRNAPrepare FITC-labeled in vitro transcribed sgRNA by using the HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit and subbing Fluorescein-12-UTP for the un-tagged UTP at a specific ratio.",
    "To calculate the ratio of Fluorescein-12-UTP to UTP, calculate the number of Uracils in the sgRNA sequence and, based off of 2 fluorescein per sgRNA strand, add Fluorescein-12-UTP to UTP at the ratio of 2 to (total number of UTP) -2. Example: With an RNA strand sequence GGCTGATGAGGCCGCACATG, which includes three UTPs, we would want to add Fluorescein-12-UTP to UTP in a 2:1 ratio. Therefore, with a 7.5 mM final concentration of UTP in the reaction mix, we would want 5 mM to be Fluorescein-12-UTP and 2.5 mM UTP. Prepare cells 24 h before uptake studies, by seeding 2.5 x 104 cells/cm2, for example, HEK293T, per well in a 24-well plate. Load FITC-labeled sgRNA into delivery vehicle (e.g., combine 30:1 PPABLG to sgRNA and let sit on ice for 15 min).Add particles from Step B3 to well with total volume of 500 μl/well, 1 μg sgRNAs/ml OptiMEM.Remove culture medium from 24-well plate, replace with 500 μl OptiMEM and delivery vehicle containing fluorescently-tagged nucleic acid. Incubate for 4 h.Wash the cells with cold PBS containing heparin (20 U/ml) three times.Trypsinize each well into a cell suspension (about 200 μl DMEM per well) and then subject to flow cytometric analysis using BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Quantify uptake using FITC positivity and intensity.For determination of intracellular distribution of genetic cargoPrepare YOYO-1 labeled plasmid by taking pSPCas9 (Addgene, px165) at 1 mg/ml in molecular biology grade water and adding 20 μM YOYO-1, such that there is 1 dye molecule per 50 bp of DNA.Seed cells on coverslips in a 24-well plate at a density of 5 x 104 cells/well and culture for 24 h.Proceed with transfection as in Steps A3-A5.Wash cells 3 times with cold PBS containing heparin (20 U/ml).",
    "Add 500 μl/well of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (see Recipes) and incubate at room temperature for 15 min to fix.Stain nuclei with DAPI and endosomes/lysosomes with Lysotracker Red according to the standard protocol provided by Thermo Fisher.Mount slides using glass slide and Fluoromount Aqueous Mounting Medium.Observe via confocal laser scanning microscopy with a 40x objective. Do observation immediately after lysotracker labeling as bleaching and loss of label occurs within hours.Via fluorescent images, note the colocalization of Lysotracker and YOYO-1 labeled plasmid to determine if the plasmid is in the endosome or cytosol.Note: Cohesive YOYO-1 fluorescence in cell body implies endosomal escape, while pointed colocalization with Lysotracker implies endosomal entrapment. For determination of energy-dependent contribution to cell uptakeNote: Repeat Procedure A but at 4 °C.Prepare YOYO-1 labeled plasmid by taking pSPCas9 (Addgene, px165) at 1 mg/ml in molecular biology grade water and adding 20 μM YOYO-1, such that there is 1 dye molecule per 50 bp of DNA.Prepare cells 24 h before uptake studies, by seeding 5 x 104 cells/well, for example HEK293T, per well in a 24-well plate. Pre-incubate cells at 4 °C for 30 min before transfection.Load YOYO-1 labeled plasmid into delivery vehicle (e.g., combine 30:1 PPABLG to plasmid and let sit on ice for 15 min).Add particles from Step D4 to each well with a total volume of 500 μl 1 μg sgRNAs/ml OptiMEM.Remove culture medium from the 24-well plate, replace with 500 μl of precooled OptiMEM and delivery vehicle containing fluorescently-tagged nucleic acid. Incubate at 4 °C for 2 h.Wash the cells with cold PBS containing heparin (20 U/ml) three times.Apply 500 μl of RIPA lysis buffer and collect lysate.Use fluorescence spectrophotometer at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm to get specific fluorescence intensity of each lysate.",
    "Perform BCA assay to determine the total protein concentration of lysate.Cellular uptake level is then presented as ng YOYO-1 labeled plasmid per mg protein and can be compared to Procedure A as control.
