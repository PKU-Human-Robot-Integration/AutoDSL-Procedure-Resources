    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSeeding of host cells and preparation of bacterial solutions – day 1\nTiming: 1 h\nHost MDCK cells are seeded onto glass coverslips (or hydrogels) and allowed to form a monolayer for 24 h. Bacteria are picked from the BHI agar plate and grown in liquid broth for approximately 16 h in preparation for the next day’s infection assay.\nSeeding of ΜDCK cells on collagen I-coated glass coverslips (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A)\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/678-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic of infection assay for formation of mounds late in infection\nSketch depicting the main steps (A–F) for seeding and infection of host epithelial MDCK cells with low MOI of L.m. so that single infection mounds are formed between 16–24 hpi.\nMix 1:100 collagen I solution (stock concentration is 3.1 mg/mL) in PBS and add 500 μL of the solution in each well of the multi-well plate. Incubate for 30 min at 37oC.\nDetach the MDCK cells from their flasks using 0.25% trypsin/EDTA by aspirating out the media from the flask, washing the cell surface with 10 mL PBS once and adding 2 mL of 0.25% trypsin/EDTA to the cells. Place the flask in the incubator at 37oC for 10 min or until all cells detach.\nAdd 8 mL of complete DMEM media to the cells, count the number of cells per mL using a hemocytometer to prepare a solution of 2×105 cells/mL.\nNote: Concentrate the cells by centrifugation or dilute them as appropriate to obtain the correct concentration.\nRemove the multi-well plate from the incubator, aspirate the collagen solution, wash the wells with PBS once and add 1 mL of the cell solution in each well.",
    "Critical: You can vary the concentration of the host cells as needed. However, due to the impact of cell confluency on intracellular bacterial spread and mound formation, consistency is important when repeating experiments.\nLet MDCK cells attach and proliferate in the incubator to form a monolayer for 24 h prior to infection. On the day of infection, the concentration of cells per well is estimated to be double what was seeded (i.e., 4×105 cells/well) and by that point, the cells should have formed a confluent monolayer.\nPreparation of bacterial liquid cultures\nAdd 2 mL of liquid BHI and the appropriate antibiotic in a 15 mL falcon tube.\nUsing a sterile pipette tip, select a single colony from the BHI agar plate and drop the tip into the liquid.\nLoosely screw on the cover of the tube and place the tubes in dark without agitation.\nLet the culture grow for 16–18 h at 25°C .\nPrior to the infection, the concentration of the bacteria should be measured using a spectrophotometer. To do so, dilute the bacterial solution 1:2 in BHI and place it in a disposable cuvette.\nMeasure the optical density (OD) at λ= 600 nm which should be ∼ 0.8 after 16 h of growth in BHI solution. If OD600 is lower than 0.8 let the bacteria grow for longer time. If it is slightly more that 0.8 prior to infection dilute appropriately.\nCritical: Since these types of measurements are based on scattering and not absorbance, each spectrophotometer will give a different number for the same cell count. Also, cuvette volume/design will affect the measured OD. Thus, all spectrophotometers used to determine cell count should be standardized.\nInfection of cells in a monolayer with low MOI of L.m.– day 2\nTiming: 2 h",
    "MDCK cells in a monolayer are infected with low MOI of L.m. to allow for the observation of distinct infection foci and mounds between 16 to 24 hpi (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nPreparation of the bacterial infection mix\nConcentrate 2 mL of 0.8 OD bacterial suspension by centrifugation for 4 min at 2000 × g.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the bacterial pellet in 2 mL of tissue culture PBS in a biosafety cabinet.\nWash the bacteria by centrifugation twice more as above and resuspend in 2 mL PBS.\nCritical: Washing the bacteria is necessary to remove soluble pyrogens from the bacterial culturing process.\nPrepare the infection mix by mixing the bacterial–PBS suspension with complete DMEM media at a ratio of 1:16 (1 mL bacterial suspension and 15 mL of DMEM media).\nNote: Note you might need to use slightly more or less bacteria in the suspension to ensure you get nicely separated infection foci overtime (see Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nInfection of host epithelial cells\nRemove the culture media from the wells, wash cells with 1 mL media and then add 1 mL of bacterial mix to each well (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nNote: Keep the rest of the infection mix for determining the multiplicity of infection, MOI (see step 5).\nCover the plate with its lid and place the plates in the incubator for 30 min to allow for bacterial invasion of host cells.\nWash the samples 4 times with media to remove most extracellular bacteria and move the plate back into the tissue culture incubator.\nAfter an additional 30 min of incubation, replace the media in the wells with fresh DMEM media supplemented with 20 μg/mL gentamicin, to ensure that any remaining extracellular bacteria are killed (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nDetermination of MOI",
    "To determine the MOI, plate 100 μL of the bacterial solution used for infection at different dilutions (1:102, 1: 103, 1: 104, 1: 105) on BHI agar plates with appropriate antibiotics.\nUse a bacterial spreader or beads to ensure that bacteria are homogeneously spread on the plates and place the plates in an incubator at 37oC.\nAfter 48 h, count the number of colonies formed in the higher dilution plates (i.e., 1: 104, 1: 105) and average out to calculate the resulting MOI.\nNote: MOI (number of bacteria/ cell) is calculated as:    (  (  N  c o l o n i e s    ·  D  f a c t o r   /  V  a g a r _ p l a t e s   )  ·  V  i n f e c t i o n _ m i x   )  /  N  h o s t _ c e l l s     , where    N  c o l o n i e s    : number of colonies grown in the plate under consideration,    D  f a c t o r    : dilution factor,    V  a g a r _ p l a t e s    : volume of bacterial solution added on agar plates,    V  i n f e c t i o n _ m i x    : volume of bacterial solution added on host cells,    N  h o s t _ c e l l s    : number of host cells in the infected well.\nSample fixation and mound volume measurement – day 3",
    "Since host cell samples were infected with a low MOI of L.m., single infection foci can be easily observed by epifluorescence microscopy starting 4–5 hpi (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D and 1E). These foci are surrounded by large domains (>300 μm) of uninfected cells. Under these conditions, infection mounds comprised of hundreds of squeezed and/or extruded infected cells start forming at about 16 hpi (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Bacteria at these late times of infection continue to grow exponentially suggestive of gentamicin not being harmful in any way to the host cells. Here, we describe a method based on acquisition of 3D confocal microscopy images and subsequent image processing to characterize the resulting volume of infection mounds at 24 hpi.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/678-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Visualization of infection mounds at 24 hpi with L.m. and calculation of mound volume\n(A) Orthogonal views of uninfected (left) or L.m.-infected host MDCK cells at 24 hpi (right). Host nuclei are shown in yellow and L.m. in black. In the case of infection a single mound is shown. Barplot on the right shows the calculated volume of the extruded infected cell domains (N=77, mean+/-SD).",
    "(B–D) Methodology followed for extracting the volume of extruded infected cell domains. From the confocal image of the region enclosing the mound (B, top), cells within the monolayer were cropped out, allowing us to calculate the volume of only extruded cells (silver cells in bottom images). Each confocal slice was converted into grayscale (representative z slices in C, left), binarized (middle), and contained within an alpha (α) shape (right, α=50). Note that z= 0 μm refers to the first confocal slice corresponding to extruded cells. (D) 3D reconstructions of the full mound volume generated by summing alpha (α) shapes determined for each confocal slice. Mound volume in μm3 is estimated by multiplying the area determined for the alpha (α) shape in each slide by the increment between z slices and summing over the total. Note that varying the alpha (α) parameter influences the shapes of the reconstructed mounds; compared to a typical choice of α=50 (left), decreasing α to 40 results in a smaller volume estimate (middle), and increasing α to 60 results in a larger volume estimate (right).\n(E) Plot showing the number of infected cells within an infection focus versus the area of the focus (in a single confocal slice) calculated based on α shapes for three different values of α considered. The resulting R2 is also provided and suggests that α=50 represents an optimum value of α that maximizes R2.\nParts of the figure reprinted with permission from (Bastounis et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nNote: We have opted to use a fluorescently-tagged L.m. strain to avoid additional steps required for immunostaining the bacteria after sample fixation.\nMDCK cell nuclei staining and sample fixation at 24 hpi",
    "Prior to fixation, incubate the samples for 10 min at 37oC with 1 μg/mL Hoechst in culture media to stain the host cells’ nuclei.\nFollowing incubation, wash the samples once gently with 1 mL PBS.\nCritical: Harsh or repetitive washing can detach the extruded infected cells from the mound (see Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nAlternative: You can opt for first fixing the samples, permeabilizing them with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS and then staining with 1 μg/mL DAPI for 30 min.\nFix the samples for 10 min at 25°C in pre-warmed (37°C) freshly-made 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS.\nWash the samples with PBS twice and proceed to image the mounds.\nPause Point: You can store the samples at 4°C for future imaging. You can also immunostain for different cellular compartments or cytoskeletal elements (for detailed protocol regarding immunostaining refer to (Bastounis et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3])).\nAcquisition of images of infection mounds using 3D confocal microscopy\nPlace the multi-well plate on the appropriate stage insert on the stage of your confocal microscope.\nNote: We chose to use rapid spinning disk confocal microscopy (rather than slower laser-scanning confocal microscopy) due to the large number of images that need to be acquired to completely capture the shape of an infection mound. Given the size of our mounds we used a 60× 1.4NA Plan Apo oil objective.\nFind the focal plane where the cell monolayer is located and use the bacterial fluorescence to identify a single infection focus.\nAcquire confocal images of the Hoechst-stained host cell nuclei and of the fluorescent bacteria using a z spacing of 0.2 μm.",
    "Note: The field of view is selected so that the infection mound is approximately at the center. We typically used 0.2 μm z spacing and imaged just one field of view for mounds formed by MDCK cells. However human A431D cells form much larger mounds, so we used a z spacing of 0.7 μm, acquired 9 fields of view and stitched them together to accurately capture the whole infection mound. For both MDCK and A431D cells mounds are ∼50 μm tall but the resulting total volume of the mounds in A431D is 1 order of magnitude larger (∼1×106 μm3) than in MDCK cells (Bastounis et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nImage processing for extraction of mound volume using custom-built scripts in MATLAB (MathWorks) (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B–2D)\nNote: All scripts used for subsequent analysis can be downloaded from our gitlab repository (see code availability) and are extensively commented.\nTo quantify the volume of the infected cells extruded from the monolayer, first crop out the lower z slices that refer to cells still attached on their substratum.\nNote: To infer what the height of the monolayer is you must also acquire confocal slices for uninfected cells. Once you know that, you can crop out the lower z slices that refer to cells still attaching on their substratum, you use the rest of slices to define domains of extruded infected cells based on their nuclei position. We use the host cell nuclei channel instead of the bacterial fluorescence for defining those domains as it enables us more accurately to determine which infected cells are in contact to the substratum versus which are extruded.",
    "Segment the channel containing the host cell nuclei to form binary images of each mound by first using a background image of a dummy coverslip lacking cells that is treated identically to the experimental coverslips that you previously obtained and subtract this background image from the image of the host cell nuclei.\nCorrect for uneven illumination if the nuclei at the center of your image appear brighter than nuclei around the periphery, by dividing the nucleus channel by a flatfield image acquired by using a concentrated dye slide.\nAdd 5 μL of 50 mg/mL coumarin dye to a Micro90-cleaned slide, add a coverslip onto the slide and seal using nail polish.\nAfter finding your focal plane using your confocal microscope, obtain a z stack of images at multiple positions that extend well above and below the focal plane. Choose laser intensity and exposure settings that avoid saturation at any plane.\nDivert light to the eyepiece and capture 100 images in a time series using the same intensity and exposure settings chosen for the flatfield image. Then, perform a median projection to convert the stack into one dark image.\nApply a median filter to every slice of the flatfield image and make a maximum intensity projection.\nSubtract the dark image from the flatfield image at each position.\nPerform a median projection across positions to obtain one flatfield image.",
    "Note: If applying a flatfield correction produces artifacts (such as in z-slices where there aren’t many nuclei at the periphery, typical at higher values of z), divide by a uniform matrix of similar intensity to the flatfield image. As the flatfield image is acquired using a concentrated dye slide, it is much brighter than a nucleus image. Correct for the difference in intensity between the flatfield and nucleus images (see our code repository for more details).\nConvert the grayscale into a binary image by applying an appropriate threshold. As the nuclei become dimmer at increasing mound heights, check the binary mask against the grayscale nucleus image at intervals of 10 z-slices and adjust the value of the threshold if necessary.\nNote: Perform adjustments, such as opening and closing steps, to perfect the segmentation. An opening step (performed using the imopen command in MATLAB) removes objects in the binary image that are below a specified size, while a closing step (performed using the imclose command in MATLAB) connects neighboring objects below a specified size into one larger object.\nDraw a boundary around the segmented nuclei and only consider the fluorescence that falls within that region while binarizing the next z-slice.\nNote: This approach of nested segmentation allows capturing dim nuclei at higher z-slices and avoiding fluorescence artifacts in regions of the image that contained cells at lower values of z but are empty for the z-slice under consideration.",
    "An alpha shape is a non-convex boundary drawn around a set of points, where the tightness of the shape around the points is determined by the alpha radius that is specified. Input the co-ordinates of the nuclei within the binarized image into the alphaShape function in MATLAB along with the alpha radius of 50 pixels. Then, feed the shape generated into the area function to determine the area enclosed within the alpha shape for each z slice.\nNote: The optimal choice of the alpha parameter needs to be determined experimentally for different host cell types (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nAdd up the area of each z slice after converting the area into μm2 and multiply by the increment between each z slice to obtain the volume of the mound in μm3.\nMonolayer tension estimation through laser wounding – day 3\nTiming: 2–3 h\nLaser wounding provides a fast perturbation to intercellular tension and can be used to determine the direction and relative magnitude of pre-existing stresses in epithelial cell sheets (Bastounis et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Here, we present the protocol we used to determine the relative tension between infected cells contained in the mounds and surrounding uninfected cells by measuring the rapid recoil of the cells away from the wound over the first few minutes after wounding, and the slower wound closure response at later times (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/678-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Schematic of laser wounding assay for monolayer tension estimation and examples of different wound configurations\n(A) Sketch depicting the principles of the laser wounding assay for an uninfected epithelial cell monolayer. Local damage induced by the focused laser normally results in cells of the monolayer recoiling away from the wound margin, due to pre-existing stress in the monolayer.",

Columns show: the brightfield image superimposed with L. m. fluorescence (green) prior to wounding (t=0 min); the corresponding E-cadherin localization prior to wounding (t=0 min); E-cadherin localization immediately after 1 min of laser exposure (t=1 min); the cell displacement vectors u (50-fold larger) calculated by performing PIV; the average uy at t=1 min (positive/negative values point towards/away from wound); and the average uy over the time period 30–40 min.\n(B) Kymographs of the average with respect to the wound displacement vectors, uy as a function of time, t (min, x-axis) and vertical position, y (μm, y-axis) for the same examples as shown in panel A (see single and double crosses).\n(C) Barplots of the mean uy along a distance of 100 μm away from the wound and calculated immediately after wounding, for cells originating from uninfected or from infected wells (N= 3 experiments, mean+/-SD, unpaired Student’s T-Test: ∗ p<0.01).\nParts of the figure reprinted with permission from (Bastounis et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nPerform the laser wounding on a segment of E-cadherin-RFP expressing MDCK cells infected with L.m.-GFP a day before.\nNote: The host cells can express any other fluorescent protein of interest, however the resulting fluorescent images need to have some texture and minimal spaces devoid of fluorescence to facilitate subsequent image analysis.",
    "Supplement Leibovitz’s L-15 with 10% FBS and 20 μg/mL gentamicin and warm to 37oC. Replace the DMEM-based existing medium in which host cells are immersed with 1 mL of the live-microscopy medium at ∼ 24 hpi.\nAlternative: If you have a CO2 control chamber in your microscope it is not necessary to use L-15 medium. However, note that phenol red will interfere with the bacterial or host cell fluorescence and must be avoided.\nWhen mounds are readily visible at 24 hpi, transfer your multi-well plate on the stage of a confocal microscope equilibrated to 37oC.\nLocate an infection focus and decide what type of wound you will create. You can wound the focus vertically (line that crosses along the middle of the mound), horizontally (tangent to the mound) or around the mound (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nNote: The choice of the cut you perform depends on the question you want to answer. For more details refer to (Bastounis et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). The size of the ablated region should be proportional to the focus size, which is dependent on the specific host cell type and bacterial strain used (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B) (see Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nStart acquiring confocal images of the E-cadherin-RFP and L.m. fluorescence using a 60× 1.4NA Plan Apo oil objective and a z spacing 0.7 μm. The E-cadherin-RFP is imaged with a 561 nm laser at full power with 300 ms exposure, the L.m.-GFP fluorescence with a 488 nm laser at full power with 20 ms exposure and the brightfield image with a 50 ms exposure. 1 image pre-wounding is sufficient.",
    "To achieve a laser wound, with a FRAP type system with a 405 nm laser, scan a line segment (or ROI) 270 times over a time period of 1 min. Acquire images every 1 min for up to 1 h post-wounding (or longer if you are interested in the wound healing process post-wounding).\nNote: These settings need to be determined empirically based on your specific setup (which includes the entire optical path, laser type, excitation power, the specific fluorophore used etc.). For instance, using full power in a different microscope to image E-cadherin-RFP could result in damaging the cells. If this scenario holds could be checked post-wounding by assessing whether the host cells are intact and thus able to mount a migratory wound-healing response or not, in which case it would be possible that they might be damaged.\nAnalysis of the displacements of cells upon laser wounding (recoil or relaxation) and their corresponding wound healing response using custom-built scripts in MATLAB (MathWorks).\nNote: All code and example data can be found in our gitlab repository (see code availability) and are extensively commented.\nCalculate the maximum intensity projections of the E-cadherin-RFP images of the cells overtime.\nPerform correlations comparing subsequent frames using the maximum intensity projections. We used a particle image velocimetry like-technique and employed windows of 36×36 pixels with a 50% overlap (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A) (Gui and Wereley, 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nFor each experiment run the run_PIV.m script which calls the urapiv.m function to calculate the displacement vectors and store them as .txt files.\nAfter generating and storing the .txt files you can inspect the vector displacements by running the script readu_laser_ablation.m (line 138 in the script).",
    "Using the component of the velocity that is perpendicular to the ablated segment, you can calculate the mean displacement along the axis of the laser wound and construct kymographs that show the mean displacement across time and position away from the wound (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nWhen running the readu_laser_ablation.m, you are storing the mean displacement perpendicular to the wound in the variable “kymographm”.\nAfter having calculated the mean displacement for all frames you plot and save the kymograph in lines 173 to 178 of the readu_laser_ablation.m script.\nThis representation allows for a detailed quantitative analysis of the recoil behavior of cells upon laser wounding and calculation of the magnitude of recoil, spatial location and temporal evolution.\nTo quantitatively characterize recoil displacement based on the behavior of cells in response to laser wounding, calculate the mean uy along the x-axis but also along the y-axis for each experiment considering just the first 100 μm away from the ablated region (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C), as cell behavior will depend on distance from the wound margin.\nNote: The mean recoil displacement is calculated in lines 182 to 184 of the readu_laser_ablation.m script.\nTraction force microscopy (TFM) during mound formation – day 3–4\nTiming: 1 day",
    "This protocol is based on the assumption that 3 kPa 2-layered polyacrylamide hydrogels have been prepared on multi-well plates as described elsewhere (Bastounis et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). The upper hydrogel layer is embedded with fluorescent tracer beads and coated with collagen I (see Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]). MDCK cells are seeded on the hydrogels and infected with low dosage of fluorescently-tagged L.m. At 4–5 hpi the plate is placed on the stage of an epifluorescence microscope. Time-lapse acquisitions of the phase contrast image of cells, of the beads’ fluorescence and of L.m. fluorescence are acquired and analyzed to calculate the 2D traction stresses that infected and uninfected cells exert during the formation of infection mounds.\nNote: As the hydrogels that we used for TFM are embedded with yellow fluorescent beads to avoid spectral overlap we infected host cells with L.m.-ActAp::mTagRFP. Any fluorescently-tagged strain or any color of fluorescent beads could be used providing there is no spectral overlap between the two.\nPrepare the sample and start the TFM acquisition centering the field of view on a single infection focus (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A)\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/678-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Representative images of TFM recording during infection\n(A) Columns show representative phase contrast images of host MDCK cells in monolayer, L.m. fluorescence and fluorescence of the tracer beads embedded on the upper surface of a 3 kPa polyacrylamide hydrogel on which host MDCK cells reside. Rows show representative two time points at early (4 hpi) and late (24 hpi) infection. Note that brightness has been enhanced for the upper image (4 hpi) so that the bacterial fluorescence signal is visible.",
    "(B) Reference image of the tracer beads for the representative recording shown in panel A (top-left) and examples of bad tracer beads’ distribution because: of the beads’ layer being too thick (top-right); of cracks on the upper hydrogel layer (bottom-left); or of the hydrogel not being flat so the beads in the bottom area in the field of view are out of focus (bottom-right).\nReplace the DMEM-based existing medium submerging host cells with 1 mL of the live-microscopy medium described above.\nCover the plate with its lid and place it in the microscope’s environmental chamber equilibrated to 37oC.\nAlternative: If you have a CO2 control chamber in your microscope it is not necessary to use L-15 medium. However, avoid phenol red.\nSet the microscope up for phase contrast microscopy with a 20× or 40× phase-contrast objective.\nLocate a single infection focus using the appropriate fluorescence filters, ensuring that host cells around this focus (in a radius 200–300 μm away) are not infected and that the center of the focus in the middle of the field of view.\nLocate the fluorescent beads using the appropriate fluorescence filters and ensure that the distribution of beads in this location is even (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nCritical: Adjust the focus slightly to the plane where the intensity of the beads is maximal.\nStart acquiring multi-channel time-lapse images every 10 min for 24 h (or more) while making sure the focus is maintained to avoid z drift.\nAt the end of the recording acquire a reference image of the beads.\nAfter an appropriate amount of time stop your recording.\nWithout moving the plate, remove the lid and add 100 μL of 10% SDS to cause host cells to detach from their substrate.",
    "Note: You can ensure that this occurs by observing them through phase contrast (see also Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11]).\nAcquire an image of the fluorescent beads upon removal of the host cells to get your reference image (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nNote: After addition of the SDS the tracer beads go back to their initial configuration since the gel is elastic and the cells that have been exerting forces on it are now removed.\nAnalyze your images using TFM using custom-built scripts in MATLAB (MathWorks) (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A and 6B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/678-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. TFM during L.m. infection mound formation in MDCK cells in monolayer\nColumns show: representative phase contrast images of MDCK cells in monolayer residing on a 3 kPa hydrogel and infected with low dosage of L.m. (same as example shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]), corresponding L.m. fluorescence, cell-matrix deformation maps (color indicates deformation magnitude in μm), traction stresses exerted by cells on their matrix (color indicates stress magnitude in Pa) and radial cell-matrix deformation, ur maps (positive deformations values in μm indicate deformations pointing away from the center of the focus, outwards).

The local deformation vector is computed by performing a correlation between each experimental image and the unstretched reference image, using an interrogation window of 32×32 with a 8 pixel spacing (for more details see below).",
    "Note: You can run the urapiv.m function as in step 10.b.i., with the exception that in this case you are comparing the image of the tracer beads at each time interval with the reference image of the undeformed beads obtained at the end of your experiment when cells have been removed from the substrate.\nCalculate the 2D traction stresses that cells exert on the gel as described elsewhere (del Álamo et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Hur et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). Ensure that you provide as inputs the Young’s Modulus (stiffness) of your hydrogel (in our case 3 kPa), the finite thickness of the hydrogel measured after manufacturing the hydrogels (in our case 40 μm) (see Troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.13]).\nNote: Codes and detailed protocols for TFM have been published (Teo et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]) and can be downloaded from publicly available repositories written in Matlab (Saraswathibhatla et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]) or as plugins working in ImageJ (Martiel et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11])."
