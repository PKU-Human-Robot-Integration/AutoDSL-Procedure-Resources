    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nSet Up Amplification Reaction\nTiming: 16 h\nTo generate high quality FISH probes, our approach relies on efficient incorporation of an amine-modified nucleotide (dUTP) during the amplification of template DNA. Nick translation only moderately amplifies DNA while PCR based probe preparation methods are not possible with large fragments. Therefore, we used the phi29 DNA polymerase, an isothermal high fidelity DNA replicator capable of whole genome amplification from single cells (Pan et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Using random nonamer primers, phi29 DNA polymerase generates large concatemers of template DNA in an unbiased rolling circle amplification reaction. phi29 is able to incorporate aminoallyl-dUTP instead of dTTP at a ratio of up to 1:1 without compromising the amplification yield.\nPut 50 ng of purified template DNA in a final volume of 2 ul in an eppendorf tube.\nNote: The amount of initial template DNA is important. It is reported that even 10 ng of total DNA template is sufficient for amplification and more than 50 ng does not increase the final yield (Pan et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nDenature the DNA at 95°C for 3 min and immediately chill on ice for 5 min.\nAdd the following to the DNA in the following order (or make a master mix for multiple tubes):\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_22_3.csv\nAlternatively, when using a nucleotide mixture with all nucleotides including amino-dUTP, use 3 ul of this mixture and add an additional 3 ul of nuclease free water (total volume of water 18.4 ul).\nCritical: The dTTP:aminoallyl-dUTP ratio is a critical variable. We tested a variety of ratios of dUTP:dTTP, keeping the final concentration at 100 uM. Based on the final amplification yield and labeling efficiency, a 1:1 ratio gave the best results.",
    "Critical: Change the Phi29 10x reaction buffer and BSA after 20-25 reactions as the amplification yield decreases with the number of freeze-thaw cycles. Alternatively, make aliquots of the reaction buffer. According to the manufacturer, older reaction buffers can be supplemented with 4 mM DTT to restore activity.\nVortex briefly, spin and incubate the tube at 30°C for 12-16 h. Immediately proceed to the next step.\nHeat inactivate the enzyme at 65°C for 10 min. Cool on ice.\nRun 1-2 ul of the reaction on 1% agarose gel. A single faint band is visible with a high molecular weight that runs above the 10 kb band of the DNA ladder (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Given the rolling circle amplification process, the size of the band will be independent of the starting material size.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/22-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Detection of Amplified Template DNA\nAgarose gel picture shows the size of the amplified product (lane 2 and 3) compared to DNA ladder (lane 1).\nAlternate Option for Multiple Fosmid Amplification\nIf more than one template is to be amplified together (example: chromosome paints made of multiple fosmids), separate master mixes can be prepared, as follows:\nPool 100 ng of each template\nCritical: Empirical testing showed that mixing more than 10 fosmids/plasmids per tube led to uneven staining, likely due to small differences in template concentrations leading to larger differences between probes after amplification. We therefore recommend to make another master mix if more than 10 different templates have to be amplified simultaneously.\nCalculate the concentration (ng/ul) of the new master mix of fosmids since the corresponding volumes are not the same for the individual purified fosmid stocks.\nTake a volume corresponding to 50 ng of this new mix (should not be more than 2 ul) in a separate tube and amplify using the protocol above.",
    "Independently amplified master mixes can then be pooled together for further downstream processing.\nThe idea is to maintain equal stoichiometry between the different fosmids present in the same tube thereby providing an equal chance for each independent fosmid to be amplified in the mix and achieve homogeneity.\nSonication and Purification of the Amplification Products\nTiming: 1-2 h\nDNA fragments obtained by RCA are concatemers of hundreds of copies of the original template. To facilitate entry into the nucleus and efficient hybridization, the DNA probe needs to be sheared into smaller fragments of 300-700 bp (average 500bp). For this purpose, we use a Branson sonicator to shear DNA into fragments of desirable probe length.\nAdd 370 ul of MilliQ water to the amplification reaction.\nSonicate the sample in an ice box using a Branson sonifier with the following parameters:\nAmplitude: 10%\nTime: 80 s\nPulse: 0.5 s (ON and OFF)\nPurify the reaction using a PCR clean up kit or SPRI beads (1.8x Ampure) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Elute in 80 ul MilliQ water. Estimate the DNA concentration using Nanodrop. (Under ideal conditions, the reaction would yield a total of 1.5 to 2.4 ug of DNA)\nNote: Sonication time should be modified to achieve an average fragment length of 500 base pairs (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). It is desirable to check the sonicated product on a gel for the first time to ensure fragment length.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/22-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Size Distribution of Fragmented DNA\nAgarose gel picture shows the size of the fragmented DNA (lane 2) post sonication compared to the DNA ladder (lane 1).\nNote: The reaction volume should be raised to 400 ul in order to avoid frothing of the sample.\nNote: If using a different sonicator, it is recommended to optimize conditions for efficient shearing.\nDNA Precipitation\nTiming: 2-18 h",
    "DNA fragments obtained post sonication are precipitated before fluorophore labeling for two reasons: a) to remove any unincorporated amine labeled dUTP that could possibly react with the amine reactive dyes leading to inefficient labeling; and b) to concentrate DNA for buffer exchange in the labeling step. We recommend using purified glycogen as a carrier to efficiently precipitate DNA.\nAdd the following to the reaction:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_22_4.csv\nAlternatives: 1 ul of tRNA (10 mg/ml) can be added instead of glycogen as a precipitation carrier.\nVortex and spin briefly and incubate the reaction at −20°C for at least 1 h.\nPause Point: The reaction can be left up to 16 hours at −20°C. Longer incubation times improve precipitation.\nSpin the tube at 16000 g for 12 min at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant and wash pellet with 500 ul of 70% Ethanol.\nSpin again at 16000 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAir dry the pellet.\nAdd 6 ul of nuclease free water to the tube and incubate at 37°C for 15 min. Pipette gently to dissolve the pellet.\nPause Point: Tubes can be stored at −20°C for days to weeks.\nLabeling the DNA Fragments with Fluorescent Dye\nTiming: 2-16 h\nThe aminoallyl group linked to dUTP reacts readily with the N-hydroxysuccinimidyl (NHS)-ester group of fluorescent dyes to form a stable amide bond, thereby coupling the dye to the modified nucleotide (Wiederschain 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). To maintain the NHS ester in its reactive state, the pH of the buffer has to be adjusted to be between 7 and 9 while the buffer cannot contain any other amine groups (e.g., Tris). At this stage, the DNA fragments can be coupled to virtually any fluorophore of choice.\nDenature the DNA by incubating the tube at 95°C for 3 min and immediately cool on ice.",
    "Spin briefly and add in the following order:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_22_5.csv\nNote: The ideal amplification yields ∼500 picomoles of 1:1 dUTP/dTTP incorporated DNA. Therefore, 1000 picomoles of the fluorescent dye are in large excess for the coupling reaction.\nVortex for 15 s, spin briefly and incubate at 18-24°C in the dark for at least one h.\nPause Point: Reaction can be left up to 3 days in the dark at 18-24°C. Increased incubation times do not improve dramatically the labeling yield.\nPurification and Precipitation of the Labeled DNA\nTiming: 3-20 h\nDNA fragments coupled to fluorescent dyes as described in section IV, need to be purified to remove excess dye. These fragments can then be precipitated individually or pooled together with other probes depending on the experiment. For example, probes targeting different regions of single/multiple chromosomes can be pooled together at this step to generate probes for chromosome painting.\nAdd 340ul of MilliQ water to the reaction and purify using the PCR purification kit or SPRI beads (1.8x Ampure) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Elute in 20 ul of MilliQ water.\nCheck the probe concentration and absorption of the fluorochrome at the specific wavelength using the ‘microarray’ function of Nanodrop (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/22-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Quantitative Analysis of the FISH Probe\nSnapshot of a nanodrop screen showing the absorbance spectrum of the final probe. The readings have been generated using the microarray function on the Nanodrop. Nucleotides absorb at 260 nm whereas the dye (ATTO-488) absorbs at 488nm. The spectrum shows a clear absorbance peak at the latter wavelength. The ratio between the two absorbances is used to calculate the labeling efficiency (see text for details).\nLabeling efficiency can be calculated using a Dye:Base ratio calculator (http://www.genelink.com/tools/gl-BDratiores.asp[href=http://www.genelink.com/tools/gl-BDratiores.asp])",
    "Transfer a volume corresponding to 400 ng of DNA of each probe (in case there is more than one probe required for simultaneous hybridization) into a separate tube.\nTo precipitate, add:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_22_6.csv\nVortex vigorously and incubate at −20°C for at least 2 h\nPause Point: Reaction can be left up to 16 hours at −20°C. Longer precipitation improves purification yield.\nSpin the reaction at 11,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C.\nDecant the supernatant and wash with cold 70% ethanol. Spin for 5 min with the same conditions.\nRemove the supernatant carefully and dry the pellet in the dark. At this point, the pellet should be colored and fluoresce under a dissecting scope (as in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/22-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Visual Assessment of the FISH Probe\nImages of microtubes containing final dissolved probes labeled with ATTO-488 and ATTO-565 under a fluorescent dissecting scope (monochrome pictures acquired sequentially, displayed in false colors).\nDissolve the obtained pellet in 20 ul deionised formamide and store at −20°C indefinitely (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nCritical: Do not use regular formamide. Probes resuspended in deionised formamide hybridize optimally in FISH experiments. See ‘before you begin’ section for the preparation of deionised formamide.\nIf probes of different concentration have to be mixed before being applied to the sample, the precipitated probes can be reconstituted in nuclease free water before adding deionized formamide to the hybridization mixture. The efficacy and long term storage of probes suspended in water should be determined by the user."
