    "This procedure may be scaled up or down, maintaining the same molar ratios of reagents. A schematic representation of the procedure is shown in Figure 1.\n**Conjugation reaction**\n**1** Pipette the required amount of protein solution \\(max. 1 ml; by preference between 2 and 10 mg ml protein) into an eppendorf tube. Adjust the reaction mixture to a total volume of 1 ml by adding a sufficient amount of normal saline into the tube.\n**CRITICAL STEP** Concentrations lower than 2 mg ml<sup>-1</sup> will strongly decrease the efficiency of the conjugation reaction.\n**2** Adjust pH of the protein solution to pH = 8.9 &#x2013; 9.1 with 0.1 M NaCO \\(max. 0.1 ml).\n**CRITICAL STEP** Alternatively, the desired pH for the reaction can be obtained by adding a stronger sodium carbonate buffer or by dialyzing the protein stock solution against 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate buffer \\(pH 9.0).\n**3** Dissolve SCN-Bz-Df in DMSO at a concentration of between 2 and 5 mM \\(1.5-3.8 mg ml<sup>-1</sup>) depending on the amount of protein or antibody used. Add this to the protein solution to give a 3-fold molar excess of the chelator over the molar amount of protein and mix immediately. Keep the DMSO concentration below 5% in the reaction mixture.\n**CRITICAL STEP** Typically, 20 &#xB5;l 5 mM SCN-Bz-Df \\(100 nmol) in DMSO is added to 5 mg intact antibody \\(33 nmol). In that case, between 0.9-1.5 Df moieties will be coupled per antibody molecule.\n**4** Incubate the reaction for 30 min at 37&#xB0;C using a Thermomixer.\n**5** This step can be performed using option A or option B depending on whether Df-conjugated proteins are radiolabeled with <sup>89</sup>Zr or <sup>68</sup>Ga, respectively.\n**A. Purification of Df-protein and subsequent labeling with <sup>89</sup>Zr.**",
    "i. Rinse a PD10 column with 20 ml 0.9% NaCl/gentisic acid 5 mg ml \\(pH = 4.9-5.3).\nii. Pipette the conjugation reaction mixture onto the column and discard the flow-through.\niii. Pipette 1.5 ml 0.9% NaCl/gentisic acid 5 mg ml<sup>-1</sup> \\(pH = 4.9-5.3) onto the column and discard the flow-through. \niv. Pipette 2 ml 0.9% NaCl/gentisic acid 5 mg ml<sup>-1</sup> \\(pH = 4.9-5.3) onto the PD-10 column and collect the Df-protein.\n**PAUSE POINT** The Df-protein can be stored at -20 &#xB0;C until the day of planned use.

Pipette the required volume \\(= **a**) of <sup>89</sup>Zr oxalic acid solution \\(max. 200 &#xB5;l, between 37 and 185 MBq) into a glass \"reaction vial\". \n**CAUTION** Follow appropriate radiation safety measures for steps v. &#x2013; xiii.\nvi. While gently shaking, add 200 &#xB5;l &#x2013; ________\\(= **a**, see v.)  =  _________ &#xB5;l 1M oxalic acid into the reaction vial. Subsequently, pipette 90 &#xB5;l 2 M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> into the reaction vial and incubate for 3 minutes at room temperature.\nvii. While gently shaking, pipette successively 0.30 ml 0.5 M HEPES \\(pH = 7.2), 0.71 ml of modified protein \\(typically 1-3 mg), and 0.70 ml 0.5 M HEPES \\(pH = 7.2) into the reaction vial.\n**CRITICAL STEP** The pH of the labeling reaction should be in the range of 6.8-7.2.  \nviii. Incubate for 1 h at room temperature while gently shaking the reaction mixture. Radiolabeling efficiency \\(typically &gt;85%) can be determined by instant thin-layer chromatography \\(ITLC) using silica-gel strips and 20 mM citric acid \\(pH 4.8-5.0)\\(ITLC eluent) as solvent. A 0.5-2.0 &#xB5;l aliquot of the reaction solution can be directly applied to the ITLC sheet.

The radiolabeled protein should be stable in storage for at least several days.\n**CRITICAL STEP** Gentisic acid is introduced during labeling and storage to prevent deterioration of the protein integrity by radiation. Consideration should also be given to assessment of the biological function of the protein after the conjugation and labeling reaction.\n**B.
