    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSet-up of a RENCA and 4T1 mouse model with sunitinib treatment\nTiming: ∼3–6 weeks\nThe following protocol describes the generation of sunitinib-induced (RENCA) and spontaneous (4T1) lung metastasis models of vessel co-option.\nSet-up of mouse model of renal cancer experimental lung metastasis (RENCA model) and of breast cancer experimental lung metastasis (4T1 model). Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A shows a detailed scheme of the RENCA model set-up and treatment schedule. Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B shows a detailed scheme of the 4T1 model set-up and treatment schedule. The RENCA and the 4T1 model are based on the models described by Bridgeman et al. (Bridgeman et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nTurn on the heating cage.\nWhen RENCA /4T1 cells reach 70% confluency after at least 2 passages, prepare them for tail vein injection:\nWash the cells 1× with phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\nDetach the cells with trypsin (1 mL for a cell culture flask T-75).\nAdd 9 mL RPMI 1640 (full), resuspend and transfer to a 50 mL conical tube.\nCount the cells with a counting chamber.\nTransfer the required volume of the cell suspension (2 × 105 cells per mouse) in a new 50 mL conical tube.\nSpin down 4 min at 145 g.\nAspirate the supernatant, add 5 mL PBS and resuspend thoroughly.\nSpin down 4 min at 145 g.\nResuspend with PBS (100 μL/mouse).\nPlace on ice.\nPlace the mice (8- to 10-week-old female immunocompetent BALB/c mice) in the heating cage for a few min.\nOn day 0, inject RENCA / 4T1 cells (2 × 105 cells in 100 μL PBS) into the tail vein of the mice using a 29G needle.",
    "Note: The number of RENCA/4T1 cells to be injected was carefully titrated in advance in order to keep the mice alive without the risk of them becoming sick before the end of the experimental period.\nPreparation of control vehicle (prepare two days before the start of the treatment). Here we describe how to prepare 100 mL of control vehicle. Of note, the amount of control vehicle should be adjusted according to the number of mice included in the experiment.\nFill a 100 mL glass bottle with 80 mL of reverse osmosis (RO) distilled water.\nAdd a stirring bar to the 80 mL of RO distilled water and place on a stirring plate at 20°C–22°C.\nDissolve 1.8 g of NaCl in the 80 mL of RO distilled water.\nAdd 0.4 mL of Tween 80. This will take about 10 min to dissolve as it is viscous.\nAdd 0.9 mL of benzyl alcohol and leave it for 5 min.\nBring the solution to pH 6.\nCritical: We recommend to gradually and slowly adjust the pH by adding 50–100 μL of 0.5 M HCl or 0.5 M NaOH (as appropriate) at a time. The use of stronger acid / base might cause the pH to change too drastically because the control vehicle does not contain buffering compounds (like TRIS, etc.).\nFilter sterilize the solution into a clean bottle.\nAdd a stirring bar and place back on the stirring plate. Slowly add 0.5 g of carboxymethylcellulose sodium and leave to stir for 14–20 h at 20°C–22°C.\nNote: Carboxymethylcellulose sodium takes a long time to dissolve.\nThe next day, the carboxymethylcellulose sodium will have mostly dissolved. It does not dissolve completely, so the control vehicle is always slightly cloudy.\nAdd another 20 mL of RO distilled water.",
    "Store this control vehicle for up to one month at 4°C.\nPreparation of sunitinib treatment (prepare one day before the start of the treatment).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2034-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Set-up of RENCA model and 4T1 model\n(A) Set-up of RENCA model and treatment schedule.\n(B) Set-up of 4T1 model and treatment schedule. This figure is taken from Teuwen et al. (Teuwen et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nFor oral dosing, add sunitinib malate powder (LC laboratories) to the control vehicle and vortex vigorously to create a suspension.\nAllocate the mice randomly to the treatment condition (control vehicle or sunitinib treatment), balanced for body weight (RENCA on Day 9; 4T1 on Day 2).\nCalculate the average weight (in g) per treatment group, the number of treatment days and the number of mice and use this average weight to calculate the amount of sunitinib needed to get 40 mg/kg/day. We recommend administering a gavage volume of 200 μL per mouse (Serwer et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Teuwen et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). Add the calculated amount of sunitinib to the prepared control vehicle into a 50 mL tube and vortex vigorously until the sunitinib has formed a mixed suspension.\nNote: Sunitinib takes time to dissolve. Preheat the control vehicle to 37°C prior to addition of sunitinib powder and vortex vigorously for several rounds.\nNote: Fresh stocks of sunitinib suspension should be prepared weekly (the drug suspension is stable for 1–2 weeks), and stored at 4°C in the dark (never freeze the drug suspension). The suspension has a bright yellow/orange color. The drug has a tendency to settle quickly, so before dosing each mouse, the drug should be vortexed or drawn up and down several times with the syringe/gavage needle.\nTreatment schedule (start treatment on day 10 (RENCA); on day 3 (4T1)).",
    "For the RENCA model, start treatment from day 10 after injection of RENCA cells and continue until day 20 or day 35. Sacrifice mice on day 21 or day 36 of the experiment and process lungs immediately. Include the following predetermined timepoints (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A ‘Treatment schedule’):\nd21 untreated (control vehicle).\nd21 treated (sunitinib).\nd36 treated (sunitinib).\nFor the 4T1 model, start treatment from day 3 after injection of 4T1 cells and continue for 10 days. Sacrifice mice on day 13 of the experiment and process lungs immediately. Include the following predetermined timepoints (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B ‘Treatment schedule’):\nd13 untreated (control vehicle).\nd13 treated (sunitinib).\nNote: Check the mice daily for signs of obvious discomfort or illness necessitating euthanasia to adhere to animal welfare guidelines in the event that humane endpoints have been reached. For example, monitor breathing speed/pattern, general behavior, bodyweight and other signs according to local/national animal welfare and monitoring guidelines.\nMetastases-derived cell and endothelial cell single-cell isolation from lung tissues from RENCA and 4T1 mouse model with sunitinib treatment\nTiming: ∼3–5.5 h\nThe following protocol describes the isolation of metastases-derived cells and ECs from murine lung tissue. The goal of this protocol is to retrieve high purity single cells. The lung EC isolation protocol mainly overlaps with the lung EC isolation section of the ‘STAR protocols for endothelial cell isolation from mouse tissues: brain, choroid, lung and muscle’ as recently published (Conchinha et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). The steps that are different from the previously published STAR protocol are the addition of a section on collection of metastases and the absence of a FACS purification step.\nCollection of metastases. (Timing: 2 h)",
    "Anesthetize mice with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (10 mg/kg body weight). Timepoints of sacrifice are indicated above: on day 21 or on day 36 for the RENCA model and on day 13 for the 4T1 model.\nOpen the thoracic cavity.\nNote: No perfusion is needed when tumor ECs are isolated. When ECs from healthy mice are isolated, perform transcardial perfusion (using a butterfly needle) via the right ventricle with 5 mL ice-cold PBS at a perfusion rate of 120 mL/h for 5 min to rinse away the blood and cut the lungs into small pieces before placing them into the gentleMACS C tube.\nDissect both lungs and place them in a petri-dish on ice.\nMicro-dissect (at least) 60 metastases per mouse under a dissection microscope using fine point tweezers. A hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained image of lung metastases is included in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nPlace the dissected tissue immediately in a gentleMACS C tube (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat#130-093-237) containing 5 mL of lung digestion buffer and keep the tube and the digestion buffer on ice.\nCritical: Make sure the tube is closed tightly.\nDigestion of metastases and isolation of metastases-derived cells (including cancer cells, immune cells, perivascular cells).

(Timing: 1 h)\nPlace the tubes into a gentleMACSTM Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec).\nRun the m_lung_01 protocol (pre-programmed by manufacturer).\nIncubate for 30 min at 37°C.\nNote: Shake the tube vigorously by hand every 5 min for faster tissue dissociation.\nNote: After 20 min of incubation time, prepare 50 mL conical tubes with 40 μm cell strainers (blue), get the MACS buffer out of the fridge and prepare 15 mL conical tubes.",
    "Place the tubes into a gentleMACSTM Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec) and run the m_lung_02 protocol (pre-programmed by manufacturer).\nFilter the cell suspension through a 40 μm cell strainer (blue; Sigma-Aldrich) into a 50 mL conical tube, rinse the strainer with 5 mL MACS buffer and transfer the suspension to a 15 mL conical tube.\nNote: use a pipette P1000 for this step.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 250 g for 5 min and aspirate the supernatant.\nPlace the tubes on ice, resuspend the cell pellet in 100 μL of MACS buffer and 100 μL of RBC lysis buffer.\nLeave on ice for 1 min.\nPlace in a 37°C water bath for 2 min.\nDilute the cell suspension with 10 mL MACS buffer, pipet up and down with a pipette P1000.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 250 g for 5 min and aspirate the supernatant.\nNote: Expect a viability between 85%-94%. Keep cells on ice whenever possible.\nIsolation of endothelial cells. (Timing: 2.5 h) Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] shows a detailed scheme of lung ECs isolation from lung metastases (also applicable to healthy lung).\nDigestion of lung metastases.

Proceed with the pellet to step b-i.\nDepletion of immune and epithelial cells using CD45 and CD326 (EpCAM) MicroBeads. (Timing: 45 min)\nAdd 80 μL MACS buffer, 10 μL CD45 MicroBeads and 10 μL CD326 (EpCAM) MicroBeads to the cell pellet.\nNote: We suggest to resuspend the cells in 80 μL of MACS buffer as indicated above. Adapt the amount of MicroBeads according to the cell number and follow the manufacturer's instructions, e.g. 10 μL of the beads for up to 1 x 107 cells; for larger numbers of cells, scale up the amount accordingly (https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/NL-en/products/cd45-microbeads-mouse.html?countryRedirected=1#gref[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/NL-en/products/cd45-microbeads-mouse.html?countryRedirected=1]; https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/cd326-epcam-microbeads-mouse.html#gref[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/cd326-epcam-microbeads-mouse.html]).\nMix and incubate for 15 min at 4°C.\nNote: Process the samples quickly to avoid non-specific binding of MicroBeads at 20°C–22°C.\nWash the cells by adding 3 mL of MACS buffer and centrifuge at 250 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant completely and resuspend the pellet in 0.5 mL of MACS buffer.\nPlace an MS column in the magnetic field of the suitable MACS Separator and rinse with 0.5 mL MACS buffer.\nApply the cell suspension from step iv onto the column through a 40 μm cell strainer (blue) and collect unlabeled cells that flow through in 15 mL conical tube (this is the fraction that contains ECs).",

For EC isolation, a MACS immune & epithelial cell depletion (2) and EC enrichment (3) was performed. The included H&E image shows lung metastases from the RENCA model (Arrows indicate metastases; scale bar: 250 μm). This figure is adapted from Conchinha et al. (Conchinha et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nDistinguishing vessel co-option from angiogenesis in lung metastases by immunostaining\nTiming: ∼2 days\nHere, we explain how to perform lung insufflation (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) for immunohistochemistry and how to execute EdU (proliferation marker) or ESM1 (tip cell marker)/CD34 (EC marker) staining and CD31 (EC marker)-podoplanin (pneumocyte marker) staining (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B–3G), which are used to score the metastases as ‘angiogenic’ or ‘vessel co-option’. Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B shows that ‘d36 sunitinib treated’ metastases (right panel, vessel co-option metastasis) contain less proliferating ECs (EdU-positive) than ‘d21 untreated’ metastases (left panel, angiogenic metastasis), as quantified in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C. Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D shows that ‘d21 sunitinib treated’ metastases (right panel, vessel co-option metastasis) contain less tip ECs (ESM1-positive) when compared to ‘d21 untreated’ metastases (left panel, angiogenic metastasis), as quantified in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E. Furthermore, Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F shows representative images of metastases with angiogenic sprouting and metastases with vessel co-option. Metastases relying on angiogenic sprouting grow as a sphere compressing the surrounding lung parenchyma and they show vessel sprouting within the metastasis, while cancer cells of metastases relying on vessel co-option are invading the surrounding lung tissue in an irregular and infiltrative manner and preserve the epithelial and vascular structure. In Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G, the quantification of both vascularization types in the RENCA model is shown for the indicated conditions.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2034-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.
