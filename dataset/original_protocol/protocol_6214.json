    "Drosophila rearing/crossingUse the CO2 pad to anesthetize and collect ~20 female virgin bnl-Gal4 flies as well as ~10 male UAS-bnl:HA1GFP3 flies.Place the flies together in a vial with fresh fly food to set up the cross: bnl-Gal4 × UAS-bnl:HA1GFP3. Keep the crossed flies in a 25 °C incubator meant for rearing Drosophila.Transfer the crossed flies to a new vial containing fresh food every other day, but keep all of the older vials where the larvae for ex vivo culturing will be collected from.After egg laying, mid-late third instar larvae will be ready for dissection after 5-6 days.Preparation of late 3rd instar Drosophila larvae for dissectionDip a paint brush into deionized water and use it to remove late 3rd instar larvae that are wandering on sides of the fly vial.Place ~10 larvae into a spot plate well containing 1x PBS. Gently swirl them around with the paint brush to remove any large food debris that may be stuck on the surface of the larvae.With forceps, gently transfer these larvae to a separate spot plate well containing 70% ethanol. Swirl the larvae around gently and ensure that they are submerged. Incubate for 1-2 min to surface sterilize them.Remove the larvae from ethanol with forceps and place them into a spot plate well containing fresh 1x PBS (different well from Step B2). Rinse the larvae twice with 1x PBS in a separate spot plate well to completely remove the ethanol.3rd Instar larva dissectionRemove one washed larva from the group and place in a plastic Petri dish containing WM1 media (see Recipes). The larva should be completely submerged in the media.Using forceps and the dissection microscope, remove and discard the bottom 1/3 of the posterior portion of the larva. The anterior portion will contain all imaginal discs aside from the genital discs (Figure 2).",
    "Invert the anterior portion of the larva by using forceps to push the mouth hooks (tip of anterior half) through the interior of the larva towards the posterior end, resulting in the imaginal discs and other interior tissues being externalized. Note: A video showing the initial larval dissection can be found at Youtube–Larval Brain Dissection in Drosophila Melanogaster[href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8py_dPMtao&t=262s] (published by WilliamsCollege) Completely remove the gut from where it attaches to the mouth hooks without disturbing the imaginal discs to minimize bacterial contamination during the ex vivo culture.Place this inverted anterior portion of the larva with gut removed into a sterile Eppendorf tube containing 1 ml WM1 media.Repeat Steps C1-C5 until all washed larvae are dissected. To avoid contamination, wash and dissect only 10-15 larvae per batch.Repeat Procedures B and C until enough dissected larvae are obtained for the experiments required. Note: The total number of larvae dissected is determined by the number of time points and treatment groups that are being used (see Step E6 below).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190815/20190815053353_9928.jpgFigure 2. Dissection scheme of a late 3rd instar Drosophila Larva. A 3-step dissection is shown for a late 3rd instar larva. First, the posterior third of the larva is cut off and discarded, leaving just the desired anterior portion. Next, the anterior portion of the carcass is inverted using forceps to push the mouth hooks through the rest of the anterior portion, resulting in the externalization of all interior tissues including the wing imaginal discs. Finally, as much of the gut as possible is removed without disturbing the imaginal discs.Serial washing of dissected larvaeNote: Perform the following in a sterile Biosafety Cabinet.Prepare 3 Eppendorf tubes with 1 ml of WM1 media in each.Wash scissor blades with 70% ethanol.Cut off ~1-2 mm of the end of a P-1000 pipette tip.",
    "The size of the cut tip opening should be large enough so that dissected larvae can fit into the pipette tip.Gently pipette and suck the dissected larvae from the bottom of the Eppendorf tube containing WM1 media into the pipette tip. Hold pressure on the pipette and let the dissected larvae settle to the bottom of the pipette tip, and then dispense them into one of the Eppendorf tubes with fresh WM1 media. Discard the remaining WM1 media in the pipette tip.Very gently invert this tube 3-5 times, and then let the dissected larvae settle to the bottom of the tube.Using a fresh pipette tip with the tip cut off in the same way as Step D2, repeat Steps D2-D6 twice with the remaining two Eppendorf tubes containing fresh WM1 media to wash the dissected larval carcasses (see Note 1).Ex vivo culture with furin inhibitorsPrepare two plastic Petri dishes, one for the control group and one for the treatment group, as follows.To the treatment dish, add WM1 media and 10x Furin Inhibitor Cocktail (see Recipes) so that the cocktail will be at a 1x working concentration of 50 μM (i.e., add 200 μl of 10x Inhibitor Cocktail to 1.8 ml of WM1 media). Mix well. Note: The total volume may have to be adjusted depending on the type of dish and number of carcasses, so the volume of 10x Inhibitor Cocktail used should be adjusted accordingly. We use a total volume of 2 ml in 35 mm Petri dishes. To the control dish, use endotoxin-free water instead of Furin inhibitor cocktail. Mix well.Split the washed carcasses between the control and inhibitor-containing dishes.Cover each dish with the lid and place in a sterile 25 °C incubator. Incubate carcasses for 1, 2.5, and 5 h (see Note 2).",
    "For each time point, remove some (at least 5) of the carcasses using a pipette with a cut off tip while minimizing the amount of liquid removed. Place these carcasses into an Eppendorf tube containing 1 ml 1x PBS.Note: The number of larvae initially dissected will depend on how many time points are being used for the ex vivo culture. We recommend using a minimum of 10 larvae per time point for each the control and treatment groups, but not to exceed 50 carcasses in a single petri dish.Antibody staining of ex vivo cultured larvaeGently invert the Eppendorf tube containing the larval carcasses 2-3 times.Let the carcasses settle to the bottom of the tube and remove the PBS from the tube by pipetting out as much liquid as possible without disturbing the carcasses with the pipette tip. Add 1 ml fresh 1x PBS to the carcasses. Repeat Steps F1-F3 twice to wash the carcasses to remove as much WM1 media and bacteria as possible.Add 1 ml 4% formaldehyde (see Recipes) to fix tissues.Rest the tube at a 45° angle so that the carcasses are settled in a single layer and fix for 25 min at room temperature without agitation. Remove the 4% formaldehyde as in Step F2.Wash 3 times with 1 ml 0.1% PBS-T (see Recipes). For each wash, leave on a nutating mixer for 5 min.Block for 1 h with rotation in 1 ml 5% Normal Goat Serum (see Recipes) at room temperature.Add α-HA (1:1,000) and α-Discs large (cell marker to visualize wing disc and ASP cells, 1:100) primary antibodies in 1 ml 5% Normal Goat Serum at their respective dilutions. Incubate overnight at 4 °C on a nutating mixer.Wash 3 times with 1 ml 0.1% PBS-T for 5 min each wash.",
    "Add the Alexa Fluor 555 Goat anti-Mouse and Alexa Fluor 647 Goat anti-Rat secondary antibodies (both 1:1,000) in 1 ml 0.1% PBS-T. Incubate on the nutating mixer for 2 h at room temperature.Wash 3 times with 1 ml 0.1% PBS-T for 15 min each wash.Mounting and imaging wing imaginal discsPlace the stained carcasses from one group into a plastic Petri dish containing enough PBS-T such that the carcasses are submerged.Using the dissection microscope and forceps, remove the wing imaginal disc from the carcasses by cutting the connections to the cuticle and trachea surrounding the disc. Avoid touching the wing imaginal disc while removing it from the carcass (see [Purves and Brachmann, 2007] for a video showing an example of wing disc removal from a carcass). Pick up the wing disc by grabbing any associated tracheal branch with one of the forceps and transfer it to a slide with a drop of Vectashield mounting medium. Note: If there is no available associated trachea to pick up the wing disc, grab the wing disc by the pouch of the disc (upper round part of the disc that does not contain Bnl-producing or receiving cells and will not be imaged).  After placing all wing discs from all carcasses on the slide, ensure that all wing discs are oriented with the associated trachea facing upwards (away from the slide).Place a coverslip on top of the wing discs by slowly lowering the coverslip down on one side to the other. Seal the edges of the coverslip to the slide using a thin layer of nail polish. Repeat Steps G1-G6 separately for each group and time point. Use the confocal microscope to image Bnl-receiving ASP cells and Bnl-producing wing disc source cells that are located just ahead of the tip of the ASP (Figure 1).",
