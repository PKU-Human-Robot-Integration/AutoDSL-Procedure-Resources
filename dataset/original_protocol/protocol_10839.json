    "1. Blood sample preparation\nDraw approximately 10 mL of whole blood from a Stage IV Cancer patient into two 5 mL vacutainers.\nCentrifuge the tubes for ten minutes at 3,000 revolutions per minute (rpm).\nThe blood sample will separate into three different layers: the bottom layer comprises the erythrocytes, the middle layer, also called the buffy coat, contains leukocytes and melanoma cells, and the top layer contains plasma and platelets. Remove as much plasma as possible without disturbing the buffy coat.\nPlace 250 μL of Histopaque 1077 in two 1 mL Wintrobe tubes.  \nUsing a 9″ Pasteur Pipette, extract the remaining plasma, the entire buffy coat, and even the top layer of erythrocytes, making sure to collect < 500 μL.\nPlace the solution atop the Histopaque layer and centrifuge the Wintrobe tubes in 15 mL conical tubes for 10 minutes at 3000 rpm.  \nThe blood will again separate, but this time the erythrocytes will be separated by the Histopaque, allowing for easy extraction of the buffy coat.  Use a 9″ Pasteur Pipette to obtain the entire buffy coat and place it in a 2 mL eppendorf tube.  \nSuspend the buffy coat in 1.5 mL of PBS with 2% v/v Tween 20.  \n2. Flow Chamber Construction\nObtain an acrylic cylinder, 20 mm outer diameter, 17 mm inner diameter, and 8 mm tall.  Drill three 5 mm diameter holes through the side of the cylinder at 90 degree angles from each other. Cut three pieces of polymer tubing (1.6 mm inner diameter, 5 mm outer diameter), and place them into the drilled holes.\nStretch Parafilm across the bottom of the acrylic ring to make a water tight seal. The parafilm forms a shallow bowl with the acrylic ring and will hold the acrylamide solution that will form a flow chamber.",
    "Suspend a 1.6 mm diameter wire through the pieces of tubing that are across from each other, making sure that the wire alone is visible through the middle of the ring. Fill the third piece of tubing with a 1.6 mm diameter wire and position the tube 1 mm away from the suspended wire.  These wires prevent acrylamide from entering the tubing.  After the acrylamide solidifies, the wires will be extracted, leaving a cylindrical flow path and a place to position an optical fiber focuses onto the flow path.\nAdd 5 mL of prepared acrylamide [20 g acrylamide (Sigma Aldrich), 0.7 g bisacrylamide (Sigma Aldrich), 100 mL of distilled water] to a small beaker. Measure out 0.02 g of ammonium persulfate (Sigma) and add it to the beaker. Mix with a stir bar for 3 minutes. Add 20 μL tetramethylethylenediamene (Fisher Scientific) to the beaker. Quickly pour the mixture into the acrylic ring, filling to the top. After a few seconds, the solution will gel, making a flow chamber mold. Carefully pull the wires out, making sure not to disturb the acrylamide gel. The flow chamber is now ready for use.\n3. Photoacoustic flowmetry set-up\nAcoustically couple a polyvinylidene fluoride piezoelectric acoustic transducer (Panametrics) to a flow chamber using ultrasound gel directly above the flow path.\nUsing a Bayonet Neill-Concelman (BNC) cable, connect the transducer to the input of a RITEC Broadband Receiver-640A (lowpass filter: out, highpass filter: 1 MHz, imput impedance: 50 Ohms, amplification: 35 dB). Connect the output of the filter to the oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS 2024B). To trigger the oscilloscope, a photodiode (Thorlabs) is set up near the transducer and is plugged into the oscilloscope using a BNC cable.",
    "A t-connector (Small Parts) is attached to one arm of the flow chamber. Two syringe pumps (Braintree Scientific) are connected to the other branches of the connector. One syringe contains air, while the other will contain the cell suspension prepared in part 1. Set the flow rates to 100 μL/minute.\nExtract the small tubing of the flow chamber until a small pocket of air forms, and insert a 1 mm diameter core optical fiber with a 0.37 numerical aperture in that slot. Fill the pocket with water to reduce interface signals and increase the amount of laser light applied to the flow path.  Due to the numerical aperture of the optical fiber and short distance to the flow path, the laser will only irradiate one slug of sample at any given time, ensuring that the sample directly in front of the laser is the same sample creating photoacoustic signals.  The laser energy should be approximately 28 mJ/cm2 with a spot size of 7 mm2.\nTurn both syringe pumps on. When the two immiscible fluids reach the t-junction they will be partitioned into homogeneous slugs and flow past the transducer.\nIrradiate the flowing sample with a nanosecond pulsed laser to generate photoacoustic waves in the melanoma cells.  As melanin is a broadband optical absorber, any visible laser wavelength can be used.  \nIf a signal appears on the oscilloscope when a slug is atop the transducer, the slug contains melanoma, and should be tracked through the system until dropping into a collection vial.\n4. Immunocytochemistry",
    "Take the captured slugs to a Cytospin 4 Centrifuge (Thermo Scientific) in order to fix them to glass slides. Place glass slides into Cytofunnels (Shandon EZ Single Cytofunnel with Brown Filter Card Thermo Scientific) and load them into the Cytospin 4 Centrifuge. Put 100 μL of 1% Bovine Serum Albumin (Sigma) in PBS into each funnel and then centrifuge at 600 rpm for 3 minutes to help the captured cells stick to the glass slides.\nAfter centrifugation, add the cell samples to the Cytofunnels and then centrifuge at 600 rpm for 3 minutes. Then spray the slides with an ethanol based fixative.\nWash the slides in PBS for 10 minutes twice.\nTo block nonspecific binding, incubate each slide with a mixture of 10 μL of Goat Serum (Sigma) and 90 μL of PBS for 1 hour at room temperature.\nAfter the incubation, decant the slides and incubate with the primary antibody solution for 1 hour in a humidified chamber at room temperature. Each slide should contain 1% MART-1 antibody raised in rabbit, 1% CD-45 antibody raised in mouse, 10% Goat serum, and 89% PBS.\nAfter incubation, wash the slides in PBS for 10 minutes three times.\nThe slides are then incubated in a secondary antibody solution, which has fluorophore bound to the antibodies. The mixture contains 0.05% goat anti-rabbit antibody, 0.05% goat anti-mouse antibody, 0.1% goat serum, and 99% PBS. The slides are incubated in the dark for 1 hour at room temperature.\nAfter incubation, decant the slides wash in PBS for 5 minutes three times.\nTo stain for a nucleus, incubate the cells with 0.1 μg/mL of DAPI (Invitrogen) for 1 minute. Then decant the slides and wash in PBS.",
    "Mount a coverslip over the cell sample using 20 μL of a resin-based mounting media per slide. Seal the coverslip with clear nail polish to preserve the slide. Now the slides are ready to be imaged with a fluorescent microscope.\n5.

The white blood cells, having no inherent pigmentation, produce no photoacoustic waves and manifest as a flat line of electronic noise (left).  The pigmented melanoma cells produces a robust photoacoustic wave (right).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3559/3559fig2.jpgFigure 2. \nAfter immunocytochemical staining, cultured melanoma cells show DAPI signals in blue while MART1 is highlighted in green.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3559/3559fig3.jpgFigure 3. \nOverlaying images for DAPI and MART1, as in Figure 2, with CD45 as an indicator of leukocytes, this figure shows melanoma cells among several white blood cells."
