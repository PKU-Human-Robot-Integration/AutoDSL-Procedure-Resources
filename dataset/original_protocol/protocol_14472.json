    "NOTE: Perfumes or scented lotions and products must not be worn during any of these procedures.\n1. Flower selection\nNOTE: Flowers used can be either naturally growing in the environment or kept under artificial environmental conditions. Temperature, humidity, and light level during collection can vary based on the specific flower species used, and what type of data is being collected. For example, data has been collected during the day and at night for the same flower to determine if fragrance varies over time of day, and collected from both in situ and greenhouse flowers.\nSelect a flower that is initially unopened, to standardize sample collection time. This controls for a flower changing fragrance over time.\nDepending on the duration of the blooming time, if possible, wait at least 24 hours after blooming to collect the sample, setting a standard time for all samples.\nIf there are multiple blooming flowers on a plant, mark the one that will be used with flagging tape or something similar to ensure repeated sampling of the same flower.\n2. Material preparation\nUse oven bags (approximately 40.5 cm × 44.5 cm) and corrugated PTFE tubing.\nInitially, boil oven bags in water for ~30 min to remove residual plastic compounds. To dry, bake in an oven at 175 °C.\nOnce the bags have dried, add a polypropylene bulkhead union to each corner of the closed end of the oven bags. These attachments allow connection of tubes to push charcoal filtered air in and pull fragrance out of the headspace.\nRinse all bags and tubes with 75% ethanol. Let both air dry after rinsing.\nAfter the oven bags have dried, bake bags and tubes in an oven at low heat, approximately 74-85 °C for 30 min.\n3. Volatile collection",
    "NOTE: Sterile neoprene gloves need to be worn throughout this process, as contacting the bag or filter cartridges can contaminate the samples.\nCover the selected flower with a baked oven bag. Cinch the bag together tightly with a plastic zip tie below the flower to prevent unwanted airflow into the bag.\nAttach a tube from the air outlet of the collection equipment and connect it to one of the bulkhead unions on the oven bag.\nOn the other bulkhead union, attach a glass filter cartridge containing porous polymer adsorbent.\nAttach a second tube to the collection equipment on the vacuum input. Connect end of the second tube onto the glass volatile collection filter cartridge.\nTurn on both the air pump and vacuum at the same time set at ~0.05 L/min. The headspace around the flower will fill with air, but not become overinflated. The system will pull air from the bag through the filter, trapping the floral volatiles.\nAllow the machine to run for 10 min and then turn off both the air pump and vacuum.\n\tNOTE: Flower species that produce/emit a smaller amount of fragrance may need to be sampled for a longer period of time.\nDisassemble the tubes and the glass filter cartridge. Place the filter into a glass vial with a screw-on cap. Once the cap is on, seal the vial with PTFE pipe thread tape.\nStore samples in a freezer until analyzed using GC-MS.\nRepeat this process with a clean oven bag and glass filter, this time with an empty oven bag, to collect a blank air sample as a control. This allows any background volatiles collected to be identified.",
    "NOTE: Repeating sample collection needs to be done at approximately the same time each day, as some flowers produce varying fragrance levels over the course of a day.\n4. GC-MS\nRemove the glass filter cartridge from the freezer and place into a GC-MS in the injector port.\nRelease headspace volatiles collected on porous polymer adsorbent from the adsorbent by heating in the thermal collection trap (TCT) to 220 °C for 8 min within a flow of helium gas (rate: 1.2 mL/min).\nCollect desorbed compounds in the TCT cold trap unit at -130 °C. The cold trap temperature is regulated by the GC-MS program.\nFlash heat the TCT cold trap unit to inject the compounds into the capillary column of the gas chromatograph to which the TCT cold trap unit was connected. The method for the TCT begins at -20 °C and ends at 150 °C.\nProgram the GC-MS to rise from 40 °C to 280 °C at 15 °C/min, with a 5 min hold at 40 °C.\n5. Data analysis\nFor identification, compare the mass spectra of the sample to those from mass spectra libraries (NIST and Department of Chemical Ecology, Goteborg University, Sweden11), as well as retention times of the volatiles to times of authentic compound standards12.\nCompare chromatograms of collected volatiles to identify common reoccurring peaks.\nAfter identifying the peak volatiles, use Pherobase (online database of semiochemicals and pheromones) to determine if they have been previously described in floral fragrances10.\nSubscription Required.
