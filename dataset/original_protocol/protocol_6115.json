    "IMPORTANT NOTE: All experiments with viruses (i.e., all pre-Trizol RNA isolation steps) should be performed inside a biosafety level 2 (BSL2) tissue culture laboratory according to the country and institution regulations and required permits regarding enterovirus strains handling and storage. Infection and virus passagingPrepare cells for infection 1 day before by seeding 3 x 105 RD cells per well on 12-well plates (the aim is to achieve 5 x 105 RD cells per well by the next day, which corresponds to subconfluent RD monolayers).RD cells seeded on T175 flasks and grown in complete DMEM until 80-90% confluency. Aspirate media from the cells and rinse with 10 ml of PBS. Trypsinize RD cells using 3 ml of 0.25% trypsin by gently tapping the flask.Once cells are detached, add 10 ml of complete DMEM, ensure the cells are properly resuspended by pipetting up and down. Count cells in suspension using hemocytometer.Dilute cell suspension with complete DMEM to get concentration corresponding to 3 x 105 cells per 1 ml. Seed 1 ml of cell suspension to each well of 12-well plates.Incubate overnight in 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator.Check the cell monolayers using a microscope (equal healthy cell monolayers, no CPE). Remove media from cell monolayers and infect with a total multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1, in 0.2 ml of serum-free DMEM. Use the following formula to calculate the amount of virus needed:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190513/20190513195248_2952.jpgExample: For 109 PFU/ml virus stock use, 5 x 105 cells x 0.1 PFU/cell x 103 μl/ml/109 PFU/ml = 0.05 μl. Mix using wt EV7 and mutant at either equal or 1:9 proportions, with a total MOI 0.1.Note: This assay can be completed with other viruses and cell lines. Different proportions and MOI can be used for this experiment depending on the virus growth kinetics and susceptibility of cells for infection.",
    "Using MOI 0.1 means that more than 90% of the cells remain uninfected providing enough space for competing viruses; any growth difference should also accumulate over passaging. Use triplicates for each infection, monoinfections for positive controls and mock (uninfected) cells as negative controls as suggested in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190513/20190513195422_5836.jpgFigure 1. Sample layout of two 12-well plates at either equal (Left) or 1:9 (Right) proportions. Every subsequent passage is performed on similarly aranged 12-well plates.Incubate infected cells at room temperature on a gently rocking platform for 1 h. To remove unbound virus, aspirate infection media, wash each well with 1 ml of serum-free DMEM, and overlay cells with 0.5 ml of serum-free DMEM.Incubate at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator overnight (16-20 h) until complete CPE is observed.Collect media from infected plates to a 1.5 ml tube, centrifuge at 9,600 x g for 5 min, then transfer to the new 1.5 ml tube and measure the volume.Add 0.2% BSA to supernatant (10 μl of 10% BSA per 0.5 ml of clarified supernatant).Perform 5 blind passages (with estimated, but unknown titer) using 1:10,000 volume of obtained virus stock (corresponds to MOI 0.05-0.2). Use the same infection protocol as before (steps 1-8).Note: For less efficiently replicating viruses more than 5 passages could be needed. Store virus stocks at -80 °C.Add 1 ml PBS to remaining cells and collect them by pipetting into a 1.5 ml tube (infected cells detach easily and do not require scraping). Centrifuge cells at 9,600 x g for 5 min, remove supernatant and proceed to RNA isolation from the infected cells.RNA isolation from infected cellsIsolate RNA from passages 1 and 5 using Direct-zolTM RNA MiniPrep Plus (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Direct-zolTM RNA MiniPrep Plus INSTRUCTION MANUAL ver.1.10.1[href=https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_r2070t_r2070_r2071_r2072_r2073_direct-zol_rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf]).",

The example design of the introduced mutations and sequencing primer is presented in Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190513/20190513195459_6658.jpgFigure 2. Example design of mutant virus genomes and sequencing primer. Depending on sequencing facilities, a 300-1000 bp long PCR fragment should be optimal for this assay.Perform Sanger sequencing of the PCR fragment containing the mutated region of the virus genome.Note: Please consider the nature of the virus (intracellular or budded virions) for choosing the correct sample to analyze. Sometimes analyzing RNA from media rather than from infected cells can be considered. For enteroviruses it is not a crucial step; therefore an easier approach (RNA isolation from infected cells) was chosen."
