    "All procedures carried out in rodents must adhere to the applicable guidelines and be approved by the local institutional ethics review committee. The experiments performed for this manuscript were carried out in accordance with the National Research Council's Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. See Figure 1 for a modified version of the standard rodent cystometry setup used in this protocol.\n1. Laboratory animals\nMaintain the rats in social housing (multiple rodents in one cage) with a 12 h light/dark cycle and ad libitum access to water and food pellets.\n2. Anesthesia and ganglionic block\nInduce initial anesthesia by placing the animal in a closed box gassed with 4%-5% isoflurane in O2 (1 L/min).\nAnesthetize the animal using urethane.\n\t\nInject urethane subcutaneously bilaterally (1/2 dose on each side of the animal) at a dose of 1.2 g/kg. Place the animal in a cage to allow the urethane to take effect, which generally takes 2 h.\nAlternatively, administer urethane intraperitoneally (i.p.) by injecting the full dose in two separate doses ~10 min apart.\nAfter waiting for the appropriate time for the urethane to take effect (s.c.: 2 h, i.p.: 30 min), test for a proper plane of anesthesia by pinching the foot of the animal using forceps. If a reflex is observed, administer an additional dose of urethane (0.05-0.1 mL i.p.), wait for 15 min, and test again. Continue to monitor the animal for the proper plane of anesthesia throughout the procedure.\nTo prevent a contraction of the bladder during distension, inject the animal with a ganglionic blocking agent, such as hexamethonium (20 mg/kg, i.p.).\nApply ophthalmic ointment to the animal's eyes to prevent drying during the experiment.",
    "3. Surgical procedure-suprapubic bladder catheterization\nShave the abdomen of the animal and perform a midline laparotomy to expose the urinary bladder.\nPrepare a catheter by flaring one end of a short (~10-15 cm) length of PE50 intramedic tubing using a flame. Place a 22 G needle into the other end of the tubing and fill with Krebs solution (see Table of Materials for the composition).\nPlace a small loop of 3-0 silk suture over the dome of the bladder and perform a small cystostomy (using fine scissors or an 18 G needle) large enough to insert the flared end of the catheter made above. With one hand holding the catheter in place, use the other hand to tighten the loop of the suture to secure the catheter in place. Finish securing the catheter by tying two knots in the suture and pulling the catheter back until the flared head is in contact with the bladder wall.\n\t\nAlternatively, secure the catheter using a classic purse-string suture technique, as previously described for cystometry12.\n\t\tNOTE: It is imperative not to introduce air bubbles into the bladder during this procedure.\nTest the setup for leaks by infusing a small amount of Krebs solution through the catheter. If the fluid leaks out of the cystostomy, resecure the catheter with additional suture around the cystostomy.\n4. Transurethral catheterization\nDip the end of a 20 G x 1\" I.V. catheter (with the needle removed) in surgical lubricant.",
    "Hold the external urethral meatus gently with a pair of forceps and insert the tip of the catheter into the urethral orifice in the direction of the tail until the tip causes the wall of the adjacent vaginal opening to deform. Rotate the catheter 90° (bringing the Luer-Lock end of the catheter toward the tail) and gently advance. Fully insert the catheter until the Luer-Lock hub is approximately 5 mm distal from the external urethral opening.\n\tNOTE: Do not insert the catheter too far, which may cause the tip to poke the inside wall of the bladder. If resistance is felt while advancing the catheter, stop and begin again or risk puncturing the urethra. See the discussion section on tips to increase successful catheterization.\nSecure the catheter and prevent leakage around the catheter by looping a short length of 3-0 silk suture around the external urethral meatus and tie it off tightly. Secure the catheter to the tail with tape to prevent it from accidentally being pulled out.\nOnce catheterized, gently infuse Krebs solution into the bladder through the suprapubic bladder catheter and confirm that the fluid flows out of the urethral catheter and not around it. If necessary, retie the suture around the external urethral orifice.\nClose the abdominal incision over the bladder using a 3-0 silk suture.\n5. Experimental setup\nSecure the animal on a board capable of being inclined to aid in the draining of intravesical fluid through the urethral catheter. Place a heating pad and absorbent underpad between the animal and the board to maintain body heat and absorb fluid draining from the urethral catheter.",
    "Connect the suprapubic catheter to a three-way stopcock, which connects the catheter to a syringe pump and a pressure transducer. Connect the pressure transducer to a computer by way of an amplifier and a data acquisition system.\n\tNOTE: Care should be taken to prevent air bubbles from forming in the tubing connecting the syringe pump, transducer, and bladder catheter.\nCalibrate the bladder pressure recording using the procedure suggested by the manufacturer of the pressure transducer and/or data acquisition software.\nInfuse Krebs solution through the suprapubic catheter at a rate of 0.1 mL/min and allow the fluid to drain from the urethral catheter for 1 h to wash out any residual ATP released during the catheter implantations.\nAfter this washout period, cap the urethral catheter using a Luer-Lock plug and measure the pressure in the bladder. Look for a slow rise in the intravesical pressure to a pressure of 30 cm H2O without a sharp increase in pressure, which would indicate a bladder contraction (see Figure 2). Remove the plug from the urethral catheter when the pressure reaches 30 cm H2O to prevent damage to the bladder.\n\t​NOTE: If bladder contractions continue to occur after 1 h, give an additional dose of hexamethonium (5 mg/kg dose i.p.).\n6. Collection of samples\nInfuse the bladder at 0.1 mL/min and collect the eluate from the urethral catheter. Test 100 µL aliquots of the eluate immediately for ATP (see below) or freeze for later batch quantification.\nTo test the effect of bladder distension on luminal ATP concentrations, cap the urethral catheter with the plug and monitor bladder pressure until it reaches the desired level. Then, uncap the urethral catheter and collect the eluate for ATP measurement or freezing, as described above.",
    "After each distension, allow the bladder to rest and wash out for 10-15 min before taking additional samples. Take a total of 3-5 predistension samples and 3-5 samples at each desired distention pressure to demonstrate repeatability.\nTo test the effect of drugs on the release of ATP, switch the Krebs solution infusing the bladder to Krebs containing the drug of choice. Perfuse at 0.1 mL/min for 10-15 min for the drug to have an effect, and then collect the samples from non-distended and distended bladders as described in steps 6.1 and 6.2.\n7. Quantifying ATP from collected samples\nQuantify ATP in the collected 100 µL samples using a commercially available luciferin/luciferase assay kit following the manufacturer's instructions and a luminometer.\n\t\nTo quantify ATP, combine 100 µL samples of perfusate with 50 µL of the assay mix and place them in the luminometer for reading. To convert the Relative Light Units (RLUs) reported by the luminometer to a concentration of ATP, make serial dilutions of ATP in Krebs solution ranging from 1 µM to 10 pM in 10-fold dilutions to create a standard curve and read them in the luminometer. Plot the resulting readings on a graph and perform a non-linear (quadratic) regression to extrapolate concentrations from the samples taken from the animal.\n\t\t​NOTE: It is important to make ATP standards for any drug solution tested in the experiment, as many drugs interfere with the luciferin/luciferase reaction, which must be corrected for.\n8. Euthanasia of animals\nWhen the experiment is completed and all the samples are collected, humanely euthanize the animal according to USDA guidelines and the National Research Council's Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.",
    "Remove the anesthetized animal from the experimental setup, place it in a closed box, and gas it with 100% CO2. Ensure that the fill rate is equal to 30%-70% of the chamber volume per minute (e.g., 3-7 L/min for a box with a 10 L volume). Continue the CO2 flow for at least 1 min after respiration ceases.\nUse a secondary form of euthanasia to ensure death.\n\t\nPerform a thoracotomy as a secondary form of euthanasia by grasping the small flap of skin at the caudal end of the sternum and cutting a small hole in the skin and musculature at the diaphragm with a sharp pair of scissors. Complete the thoracotomy by inserting the scissors into the opening and cutting rostrally through the rib cage and exposing the thoracic cavity.\n\t\tNOTE: The euthanized animal should be disposed of according to institutional guidelines.\nSubscription Required.
