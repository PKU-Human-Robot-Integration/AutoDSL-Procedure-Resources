    "NOTE: All cells used in this protocol should be grown for at least three generations after thawing from frozen stock cells.\n1. Harvest Melanoma Cell-derived Factors\nPreparations\nObtain B16F10 cells and a mouse melanoma cell line.\n\t\tNOTE: For this protocol, a mouse melanoma cell line was obtained from the Stem Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\nMake a complete medium for the B16F10 cell culture (100 mL). Use Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 U/mL of penicillin, and 50 µg/mL of streptomycin.\nMake a serum-free medium for the starvation of the B16F10 cells (50 mL). Use DMEM medium without FBS, 50 U/mL of penicillin, and 50 µg/mL of streptomycin.\nPrepare melanoma-conditioned medium (CM)\nSeed 2.0 x 105 B16F10 cells in a 100 mm dish with 10 mL of 10% FBS DMEM. Then incubate the cells in a 37 °C incubator in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nWhen the cells reach about 80% of confluence, remove the culture medium, wash the cells twice with 5 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (1x, pH 7.4), and replace the medium with a 10 mL serum-free medium for the starvation.\nReturn the cells to the incubator for 18–24 h.\nAfter the starvation, collect the conditioned medium (CM) with a pipette and transfer it to a fresh 50 mL centrifuge tube.\n\t\tNOTE: The conditioned medium is the supernatant of the B16F10 cell cultures. Make sure the B16F10 cells are in good condition before collecting the CM.\nCentrifuge the CM for 5 min at 1,000 x g at 4 °C.\nPipette the supernatant and transfer it to a fresh sterile tube or bottle.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid pipetting off the pellet at the bottom of the tube.",
    "To remove the cell debris, filter the CM by passing it through a syringe-connected 0.45 µm filter on top of a sterile bottle or tube.\n\t\tNOTE: 0.22 µm filters are optimal for filtering the CM.\nStore the filtered supernatant at -20 °C until use.\n\t\tNOTE: It is best not to store the supernatant at -20 °C for more than one month. Alternatively, store the CM at -80 °C for more extended periods of time for the differentiation of adipocyte.\n2. Induction of Bone Marrow Adipocytes by Melanoma Cell-derived Factors\nPreparations\nMake 100 mL of adipogenic induction medium28. Use a complete DMEM supplemented with 5 µg/mL of insulin, 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and 1 µM dexamethasone. Store it up to two weeks at 4 °C.\nPrepare 100 mL of adipogenic maintenance medium. Use a complete DMEM or mixed with 50% melanoma CM supplemented with 5 µg/mL of insulin.\nMake an Oil Red O stock solution. Dissolve 30 mg of Oil Red O powder in 10 mL of isopropanol (≥ 99.5%) and mix them well by vortex.\n\t\tNOTE: Store it up to 1 year at 4 °C.\nMake an Oil Red O working solution. In the fume hood, dilute the Oil Red O stock solution (from step 2.1.3) with deionized water in a ratio of 3:2. Incubate the mixture for 15 min at room temperature and filter it through a 0.22 µm filter before use.\n\t\tNOTE: Only use the fresh working solution within 2 h.\nAdipocyte differentiation\nCulture a stromal cell line 14F1.1 from mouse bone marrow29 in a 60 mm dish with a complete DMEM at 80% confluency in a 37 °C incubator in an atmosphere of 5% CO2.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, replace 14F1.1 with primary bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells30.",
    "Trypsinize the cells with 1.5 mL of a 0.25% trypsin solution in an incubator for 1–2 min.\nAdd 5 mL of 10% FBS medium to the cells and count the cell numbers with a glass hemocytometer; then adjust the cell density to about 1–2 x 105/mL.\nSeed 5 x 104 of 14F1.1 cells per well in a 24-well plate with 0.5 mL of adipogenic induction medium. After two days of incubation, the cells reach about 90% of confluence.\n\t\tNOTE: This step is very critical. Bone marrow stromal cells cannot be induced to adipocytes without an adipogenic induction medium.\nRemove the induction medium and wash the cells twice with 1 mL of PBS each time.\nChange to 1 mL of adipogenic maintenance medium and continue to culture the cells until adipocyte maturation.\n\t\tNOTE: Under a microscope, adipocytes look like small or large soap bubbles and are very easy to recognize. Usually, mature adipocytes are present on the 6th or 8th day.\nStain the mature adipocytes with Oil Red O or collect the adipocytes for a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis.\nAdipocyte Staining\nWash the differentiated 14F1.1 cells 2x with PBS and fix them in 3.7% formaldehyde for 1 h.\nRinse the cells in 60% isopropanol and allow them to dry completely.\nAdd 0.2 mL of the Oil Red O working solution to the wells and incubate it at room temperature for 0.5 to 2 h.\nWash the cells with water to remove the unbound dyes.\nPhoto the dyed adipocytes under a light microscope.\n3. Coculture of Bone Marrow Adipocytes with Melanoma Cells\nPreparations",
    "Prepare mature bone marrow adipocytes: induce the 14F1.1 cells into mature BM adipocytes in 24-well plates with the adipogenic induction medium for 2 days, and then maintain them in the adipogenic maintenance medium for an additional 6–8 days.\nPrepare the B16F10 cells: culture the B16F10 cells in 60 mm dishes with 5 mL of DMEM medium.\nMoisten the membrane insert (e.g. transwell): add 150 µL of FBS-free DMEM medium to the 0.4 µm pore-size membrane inserts and immerse them upon the wells of 24-well plates filled with 500 µL of FBS-free DMEM medium.\nCoculture setting\nSlowly pipette off the medium of each insert.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not destroy the membrane when removing the medium.\nSeed the B16F10 cells (0/103/105/106) in the 0.4 µm pore inserts from step 3.2.1.\nReplace the adipogenic maintenance medium in the wells with the mature bone marrow adipocytes from step 3.1.1. with 600 µL of complete DMEM medium.\nTransfer the inserts filled with the B16F10 cells (from step 3.2.2) upon the wells with the mature bone marrow adipocytes (from step 3.2.3) for the coculture experiments.\nIncubate the cocultures at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 2 days.\nAfter 48 h of incubation, remove the inserts of the coculture and then wash the adipocytes 2x with 500 µL of 1x PBS.\n\t\tNOTE: Optionally, collect the B16F10 cells in the inserts for analysis if needed.\nStain the adipocytes with the Oil Red O working solution or collect the adipocytes for qPCR analysis.\n\t\tNOTE: See the staining procedure in step 2.3.\nPhoto the dyed adipocytes under a light microscope.\n4. qPCR Analysis of the Adipocyte-specific Gene Signature\nAdd 0.5 mL of ready-to-use RNA isolation reagent per well in a 24-well plate in which mature adipocyte is ready to detect.",
    "Follow a standard protocol for the RNA extraction and the cDNA synthesis31.\nUse the primer for 18S and GAPDH as the control, and CEBPα/β, PPARγ, FABP4, leptin, Pref-1, or adiponectin for the adipocyte-specific gene signature (Table 1).\nRun the following reaction in a thermal cycler: 95 °C for 20 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 1 s, and 60 °C for 20 s.\nUse the 2-ΔΔCt method to calculate the fold changes32.\nSubscription Required.
