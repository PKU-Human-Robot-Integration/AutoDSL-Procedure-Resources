    "1. Tissue Collection and Dissection\nIn each vial containing dry yeast, culture 10 adult female flies with 10 males for 2-3 days.\n\tNote: Maintaining well-fed female flies will improve the overall quality and yield of ovary production and facilitate dissection.\nAnesthetize the female flies on a carbon dioxide (CO2) fly pad.\nUnder the stereoscope, place several drops of RT medium (Schneider's Drosophila medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)) on a dissecting pad. Conduct all the dissection procedures in the medium to keep the tissues alive and healthy.\nGrab a fattened female fly with sharp fine-nosed forceps at its lower thorax. Use another set of forceps to tug gently at the extreme posterior of the fly until the tissues in the abdomen are exposed. Detach the two ovaries from other tissues (e.g. guts).\n\tNote: Each ovary displays an opaque structure that is composed of 16-20 attached ovarioles.\nTo enhance the penetration of reagents, open the ovaries by pulling them apart and passing the tips of the forceps in between each ovariole a couple of times. Keep the ovarioles connected within an ovary to minimize loss of tissues during the following procedures.\nTransfer the ovaries immediately to an 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube containing 500 µl of Schneider's Drosophila medium with 10% FBS.\nRepeat the dissection and collect 10-15 ovaries in each microcentrifuge tube.\n2. EdU Labeling\nAspirate the medium in each tube, and replace with 500 µl of Schneider's Drosophila medium with 10% FBS containing 7 µM aphidicolin.",
    "Note: Aphidicolin is used to block nuclear DNA synthesis by inhibiting DNA polymerase α without affecting mtDNA replication 7,12. It is possible to increase the aphidicolin concentration to up to 70 µM to achieve better inhibition. The stock solution of 3-30 mM aphidicolin in DMSO can be stored in the dark at -20 °C for up to 6 weeks.\nTo keep the ovaries healthy, ensure that they are immersed under solutions while changing the medium. Use Schneider's Drosophila medium with 10% FBS through step 2.6.\nIncubate ovaries for 3 hr at RT on a bench-top rocker with gentle rotation.\n\t\nFor drug treatment, e.g., mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide 4-trifluoromethoxy phenylhydrazone (FCCP), add the appropriate concentration of drug (e.g., 10 µM FCCP) into the medium after 2 hr of aphidicolin treatment. Continue incubating for another 1 hr.\nRemove the medium containing aphidicolin with or without drug. Briefly rinse the ovaries with medium (aphidicolin is not necessary) twice.\nAdd 1 ml medium containing 10 µM EdU and 7 µM aphidicolin and continue incubating at RT for 2 hr. Store the 10 mM EdU stock solution (in DMSO) at -20 °C.\nRemove the medium containing EdU and aphidicolin. Wash with medium (without aphidicolin) twice for 3 min each.\n3. Tissue Fixation and Permeabilization\nPrepare a 4% paraformaldehyde solution in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4).\n\tNote: We used commercial available paraformaldehyde stored in pre-scored ampoules. Open a new ampoule and dilute to 4% before use.\n\tCAUTION: Formaldehyde is toxic; it should be handled in a fume hood with skin and eye protection.\nFix ovaries with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at RT with gentle rotation.\nRemove the fixative and wash ovaries twice in 1 ml of 3% BSA in PBS for 5 min each time.",
    "To permeabilize the tissues, remove the wash solution and add 1 ml of 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. Incubate at RT for 20 min.\nRemove the permeabilization solution and wash twice in 1 ml of 3% BSA in PBS.\n4. EdU Detection\nNote: EdU detection is based on \"click\" chemistry, a Cu(I)-catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition 13, which adds fluorescent azides to the terminal alkyne group of EdU, and the fluorescent molecule is subjected to subsequent detection. Since Cu(I), which is easily oxidized to the non-catalytic Cu(II) species, is required to catalyze the reaction, it is recommended to reduce the Cu(II) sulfate in situ to obtain Cu(I). That is, Cu(II) sulfate is used in the presence of a reductant such as ascorbic acid (herein the \"buffer additive\") to generate copper (I).\nBefore the experiment, prepare the working solution of the Alexa Fluor azide (Alexa Fluor 488 azide, Alexa Fluor 555 azide or others, depending on the preferred fluorophore, which are named as \"dye azide\" hereafter), EdU reaction buffer and EdU buffer additive according to manufacturer's instructions.\n\t\nReconstitute the dye azide in 70 µl DMSO. Store the working solution at -20 °C for up to 1 year.\nPrepare fresh EdU reaction buffer by diluting the 10x EdU reaction buffer with deionized water.\n\t\tNote: After use, store any remaining 1x solution at 4 °C. The 1x solution is stable for up to 6 months.\nMake a 10x stock solution of the EdU buffer additive by fully dissolving the powder in 2 ml deionized water.\n\t\tNote: This stock solution is stable for up to 1 year at -20 °C. If the solution develops a brown color, it has degraded and should be discarded.",
    "Prepare the EdU reaction cocktail fresh each time, and use within 15 min of preparation. To achieve reproducible results, make sure the reaction components are maintained at the same ratios.\n\t\nMake fresh 1x EdU buffer additive solution by diluting the 10x stock solution (prepared in step 4.1.3) 1:10 in deionized water. Use this solution on the same day.\nPrepare 1 ml of EdU reaction cocktail by combining the following ingredients in order: 860 µl 1x EdU reaction buffer, 40 µl CuSO4, 2.5 µl dye azide, 100 µl 1x EdU buffer additive.\n\t\tNote: It is important that the ingredients are added in order to ensure optimal performance.\nRemove the PBS with 3% BSA and add 0.5 ml of the EdU reaction cocktail to each tube. Incubate at RT for 30 min with gentle rotation. Keep the samples protected from light.\nRemove the EdU reaction cocktail and wash once with 1 ml of 3% BSA in PBS.\nWash the samples once with 1 ml of PBS.\n5. Antibody Labeling\nNote: Perform antibody labeling after EdU staining. If no additional staining is desired, one can proceed to mounting and imaging directly. It is important that the samples be protected from light in all the following procedures.\nRemove the wash solution. Block the ovaries in 1 ml of blocking solution containing 0.2% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min.\nRemove the blocking solution and replace with primary antibody diluted in blocking solution (e.g., mouse ATP synthase subunit α antibody, 1:1,000 dilution). Incubate in the dark at 4 °C O/N.\nWash the samples with 1 ml of blocking solution 3 times, 10 min each time. To minimize the background, wash two more times for 30 min each. Remove the blocking solution.",
    "Incubate with secondary antibody diluted in blocking solution (e.g., goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568 secondary antibody, 1:200 dilution) for 2 hr at RT.\n\tNote: Use a different color than the one coupled to EdU.\nRepeat the wash steps performed in step 5.3.\nRinse with 1 ml of PBS once to remove the detergent.\n6. Mounting and Imaging\nCarefully remove all the PBS and immediately cover ovaries with 50 µl mounting medium (with or without DAPI).\n\tNote: Use a mounting medium that does not harden while the ovarioles are being separated from each other. Ovaries can be stored in mounting medium at 4 °C for up to a week.\nCut the end of a pipette tip and use it to transfer ovaries carefully onto a microscope slide.\nCompletely separate each ovariole with sharp fine-nosed forceps under the stereomicroscope. Remove the connecting tissues at the posterior end and stage 14 or mature egg chambers. The young egg chambers are at the anterior end and transparent.\nAlign the egg chambers with forceps so that they do not overlap with each other.\nSlowly lower a # 1.5 glass coverslip on top of the samples. Allow the mounting medium to polymerize for several hours at RT. Seal with transparent nail polish.\nImage slides the next day, or store at 4 °C prior to imaging.\nVisualize under a confocal microscope with a 63X oil-immersion objective. Capture three-dimensional z-stacks images.\n\tNote: There is strong EdU signal in later-stage egg chambers and background fluorescence in the epithelial sheath. When examining EdU labeling in a particular germarium, one should avoid germariums that are overlapped by or close to other tissues or later-stage egg chambers."
