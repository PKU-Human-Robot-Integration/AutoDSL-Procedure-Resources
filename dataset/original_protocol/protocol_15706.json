Prime the filter by centrifuging the ultrafiltration units at 4,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: 3 kDa molecular weight cutoff ultrafiltration units were used in the current protocol to retain all extracellular proteins released from cells. Larger molecular weight cutoff ultrafiltration units (e.g., 30 kDa) would also work with this protocol, however extracellular proteins smaller than 30 kDa would be filtered out and removed from the samples20,21.\nRemove PBS from the ultrafiltration units. Divide the supernatant from each condition (control and tunicamycin treated) into two ultrafiltration units each, approximately 12.5 mL of media in each.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 4,000 x g for 1 h 45 min at 4 °C, or until the concentrated media (referred to as the retentate) in each ultrafiltration unit is concentrated to 250 µL or less.\nTransfer the retentate from both control ultrafiltration units into one labeled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Transfer the retentate from both treated ultrafiltration units into another labeled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.",
    "Measure the total volume of the retentate in each microcentrifuge tube to be 500 µL. If the sample is less than 500 µL, add 0.22 μm filtered 1x PBS until the final volume is 500 µL. Place tubes in a -80 °C freezer.\n4. Cell collection\nPlace trypsin, PBS, and exosome-depleted DMEM in a 37 °C water bath.

    "Turn on the automatic fraction collector (AFC) and adjust settings to collect eight fractions, 0.5 mL per fraction, and buffer (void) volume to default.\n\tNOTE: The AFC operating conditions are as follows: column/bed volume = 10 mL; void volume = 2.70 mL; flush volume = 15 mL; optimal fraction size = 500 µL; buffer required per run = 65 mL; flow rate at 20 °C = 1.0 mL/min; reusability of the column = five uses.\nRemove the column (see Table of Materials) from 4 °C and let the column warm up to room temperature before beginning (usually ~30 min).\nRemove retentate samples from the -80 °C freezer and place on ice to thaw. While waiting, set eight labeled 1.5 mL tubes in the AFC carousel with lids facing inwards.\nInsert column into the AFC with the barcode facing the reader. Start the collection by following the instructions on screen to verify there are tubes in the carousel and the waste collector is functioning properly.\nBegin flushing the column by adding 15 mL of 1x PBS to column after the storage buffer is completely absorbed into the top portion of the column matrix. Do not add PBS too early as this will dilute the storage buffer and prevent adequate flushing.\nJust before all of the 15 mL of PBS is absorbed by the matrix, click OK to stop the flushing and remove any residual PBS from the top of the column matrix with a micropipette. Do not touch the matrix.\nAdd 500 µL of sample to the center of the column. Click OK to begin the run. Watch the sample absorb into the matrix and quickly add 8 mL of PBS to the column immediately after the sample is fully absorbed.",
    "AFC will automatically dispel the void volume into the center of the carousel and then collect all eight fractions of 500 µL each. At the conclusion of the run, remove fractions from the carousel and place on ice. Fractions 1-4 contain EVs while fractions 5-8 contain extracellular proteins. Remove void volume from the center of carousel.\nAdd 10 mL of PBS to the column after the eight fractions have been collected to wash any residual sample from the column. After the retentate sample has been fully flushed through the column, add 15 mL of 1x PBS to the column.\nAs the final PBS is being absorbed by the matrix, add 500 µL of 0.5 M sodium hydroxide to the center of the column's matrix. As the sodium hydroxide is absorbed, add 30 mL of 1x PBS to the column and let it flush through.\nIf running another sample, add eight labeled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes to carousel and repeat steps 5.7-5.10.\nOnce done with all samples, complete the following steps to preserve the column for later use. After flushing 30 mL of PBS through the column as outlined in step 5.10, add 15 mL of 0.05% sodium azide to the column.\nLeave approximately 5 mL of sodium azide on the top of the column matrix. Remove the column from the AFC and attach the top and bottom caps. Place column back at 4 °C for storage (column can be used up to five times).\n6. Ultrafiltration of EV and protein fractions\nObtain two 2 mL, 3 kDa cutoff ultrafiltration units per sample. Use one unit to concentrate the EV fractions (fractions 1-4), and the other to concentrate the protein fractions (fractions 5-8). Each unit is comprised of three parts: cone, filter, and flow-through cylinder; label each part properly.",
    "Construct the ultrafiltration unit and add 1 mL of 0.22 μm filtered 1x PBS to the filter portion and cap with the cone piece. Centrifuge the ultrafiltration unit, cone-side up at 3,500 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\nRemove the filtered PBS from the flow-through cylinder. Flip the ultrafiltration unit upside down (cone-side down) and centrifuge for 2 min at 1,000 x g at 4 °C. Remove any remaining PBS from the cone.\nAdd the appropriate fractions (the entire 500 µL volume) to each ultrafiltration unit (total volume will be 2 mL). Centrifuge columns cone-side up for 1 h 45 min at 3,500 x g at 4 °C, or until the retentate level is at 100 µL.\nRemove the flow-through cylinder and discard flow through. Flip the ultrafiltration unit upside down (cone-side down) and centrifuge for 2 min at 1,000 x g at 4 °C.\nTransfer the retentate in the cone to a labeled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and bring each sample volume to 150 µL with 0.22 µm filtered 1x PBS. Place tubes in -80 °C freezer.\n\t​NOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\n7. Media controls\nObtain two T175 cell culture flasks. Label one flask control and the other treatment.

    "Cell quality check screen will pop up; click OK and cell quality check will begin. After the check is successfully passed, the autoalignment pop-up screen will appear stating: Please fill the cell with 100 nm alignment suspension (dilution 1:250,000).\n\t\nPrepare dilution 1 of alignment suspension by adding 10 mL of particle-free water and 10 µL of 100 nm polystyrene beads to a tube (1:1,000 dilution). Gently invert to mix. Dilution 1 has a shelf life of 2-3 days at 4 °C.\nCreate dilution 2 of alignment suspension by adding 20 mL of particle-free water and 80 µL of dilution 1 (1:1,000) into a tube to create the dilution of 1:250,000. Gently invert the tube to mix. Dilution 2 has a shelf life of 30-60 min at room temperature.\nFill cell with 2 mL of dilution 2 (1:250,000). Click OK and the program will complete autoalignment (focus) and focus optimization.

A pop-up screen stating: View Video Microscope is now ready for experiments, will appear; click OK and the program will return to the cell check tab.\nRinse the polystyrene beads from the cell by injecting particle-free water into the injection port to wash the cell. Continue washing until the number of detected particles is between 0-10 (usually between 5-10 mL). Add 1 mL of 0.22 µm filtered PBS to prime the cell for the first sample.",
    "Dilute the first sample with 0.22 µm filtered PBS (start with 1:1000 dilution) and enter the dilution factor into the program. Insert 1 mL of sample into the cell and wait 5 min for particle movement to slow, as they will initially move very quickly across the screen. Set the sensitivity and shutter at 75.0 and 100, respectively.\nThe number of detected particles for ideal sample dilution is 50-200 particles. If below 50 or above 200 particles are reported, adjust the dilution of the sample. If a new dilution is required, wash the cell with particle-free water until there are 0-10 detected particles. Repeat adding diluted sample and washing until the ideal dilution is found.\nCheck all 11 camera positions to visualize that particle movement has slowed and ensure that the number of detected particles is similar between all camera positions. If the number of particles differs greatly across camera positions, add more sample.\nClick on the Measurement tab and Run Video Acquisition. Under the video acquisition tab, enter custom name for sample and identify a safe location. Check the autosave.txt and autosave.pdf boxes to save data.\nSet the temperature to 25 °C, click on 488 nm to set laser, and click on 11 for camera positions. Click OK to run data collection.

    "After data is collected, a pop-up screen titled Positions Overview will appear providing data for each of the 11 positions. If there are more than two positions removed from analysis, repeat the procedure with more sample. If not, click on the Continue button. A PDF and txt file will open containing the results. Save the files in a safe location.\nTo run another sample, go to Cell Check tab and repeat steps 10.6 through 10.12. If done, wash cell with particle-free water until the number of detected particles is 0-10 (about 5-10 mL).
