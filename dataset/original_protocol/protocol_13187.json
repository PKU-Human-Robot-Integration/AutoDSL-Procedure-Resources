    "This study adhered to the guidelines outlined in the 8th edition of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals13. The research received approval from the Ethics Committee of Lanzhou University Second Hospital and was documented in adherence to The ARRIVE guidelines 2.014. Twelve healthy Wistar rats (six males weighing 290-330 g and six females weighing 250-280 g) aged 12-16 weeks were accommodated in the GLP Animal Laboratory of Lanzhou University for 3 days before the actual experiment. The rat cages utilized were of the R5 type, measuring 545 mm x 395 mm x 200 mm, and were equipped with autoclaved bedding material. All rats were provided unrestricted access to both food and water. The laboratory maintained an average humidity of 25%, an average temperature of 24 °C, and a light cycle that alternated between day and night (7:00 AM/7:00 PM). At the conclusion of the study, all animals were humanely euthanized using an overdose of isoflurane. For comprehensive information regarding the materials and instruments employed in this study, please refer to the Table of Materials.\n1. Sample size calculation and animal selection\nChoose the resource equation method15 to estimate the animal sample size using equation (1).\nE = Total number of animals − Total number of groups  (1)\n\tWhere E is the degree of freedom of analysis of variance (ANOVA) and ranges from 10 to 20.\n\tNOTE: In this study, 12 animals were divided into two groups A and B (three males and three females per group).\nDefine the primary outcome of this study as the success rate and time consumption of repeated blood sampling by a single individual.",
    "Define the secondary outcome measures as changes in rat body weight, food and water intake, as well as the incidence of adverse events (such as clavicle fractures, subcutaneous hematomas, pneumothorax, and mortality).\nDefine successful blood sampling as meeting the following criteria: i) fewer than three punctures for a single blood collection; ii) a total time (from rat restraint to completion of blood collection) not exceeding 5 min; and iii) achieving the targeted blood volume while obtaining clear plasma. Consider any deviation from these criteria a sampling failure.\n2. Animal restraint and blood collection\nNOTE: Blood samples from group A and B rats were collected by two experienced researchers, both of whom had drawn at least 100 blood samples. Blood samples were gathered from both groups of rats for a total of 96 times over the course of 4 days. This blood collection method does not require anesthesia or additional restraint devices for the rats. However, it necessitates adept handling techniques.\nAt 8:00 AM on the day before blood sampling (day 1), assign each rat to its individual cage while its food and water are weighed. Then, have another researcher, blinded to the measurements, record the rats' weight, food consumption, and water intake every day at 8:00 AM from day 1 onwards.\nTo follow this protocol, first draw blood at 10:00 AM and then at 10:00 PM each day, collecting 0.15 mL of blood alternately from the subclavian veins on both sides.\n\tNOTE: The amount of blood to be collected was determined by the maximum volume that the lowest-weight rat could tolerate within a week.\nFlush a syringe with sodium heparin (25 U/mL) and disinfect the injection site with alcohol.\nGently stroke the rat's back skin and pinch its neck repeatedly to help the rat relax (Video 1).",
    "Using the non-dominant hand's thumb and index finger, grip and lift the rat's neck skin firmly (Figure 1A and Video 1).\nWith coordination from the dominant hand, use the remaining three fingers and palm of the non-dominant hand to secure the rat's back skin and immobilize its front limbs (Figure 1B,C and Video 2).\n\tNOTE: If the rat resists or struggles, this procedure can be repeated several times to help the rat become accustomed to the handling. The following steps are key to successful blood collection.\nUsing the non-dominant hand's index finger, gently push down on the rat's head skin while the other fingers, along with the palm, assist in outwardly rotating the shoulder joint. During this process, use the dominant hand to fully extend the rat's shoulder joint (Figure 1D-F and Video 2).\nGrip the rat firmly with the non-dominant hand to align the rat's head and body in a straight line (Figure 1G,H). Then, use the dominant hand to locate the position of the clavicle and confirm the puncture site (Figure 1I, Video 2, and Video 3).\n\tNOTE: Shaving the rat is not necessary. In Figure 1, shaving was done only to show the clavicle and puncture position to a greater extent.\nHolding the syringe parallel to the rat's body in the dominant hand, with the needle tip facing upwards and the syringe scale toward the experimenter, maintain an approximately 15° angle with the midline of the rat's body. Insert the needle 0.5 cm below the clavicle notch (at the junction of the proximal third of the clavicle and the sternum), ensuring that the needle remains parallel to the rat's body (Figure 1J and Video 3).",
    "NOTE: Particular attention should be paid to the angle and depth of the needle insertion to avoid piercing the blood vessel or causing inadvertent damage to adjacent vessels.\nGently withdraw the syringe slightly to create a negative pressure, often accompanied by a palpable sensation of breakthrough upon entering the blood vessel (particularly pronounced during the initial blood collection). Maintain this position and collect 0.1-1.0 mL of blood at a constant speed as needed (following the IACUC guidelines of approximately 4-5.3 mL/kg of blood per week1) (Figure 1K and Video 3).\nIf there is no blood upon puncture, try gently adjusting the angle and depth of the needle or gently rotate the syringe (Video 3). If three consecutive attempts on the same side are unsuccessful, stop all bleeding and then switch to the opposite side for the puncture.\n\t​NOTE: Swift puncture through the skin is advisable to prevent the rat from struggling due to discomfort.\nApply a cotton swab for hemostasis and return the rat to its cage (Video 4).\nProcess the blood samples according to the experimental requirements.\n3. Blood sample processing\nDispose of the syringe needle into a sharps container. Transfer the collected blood into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube previously rinsed with heparin. Place the tube into a centrifuge, setting it at 4 °C and 1,200 x g, and centrifuge for 10 min to separate plasma. Transfer the serum using a 1.0 mL Pasteur pipette into a clean microcentrifuge tube and store it at -80 °C.",
    "​NOTE: To prevent hemolysis due to pressure, remove the needle tip when necessary. During plasma aspiration, avoid drawing blood cells from the bottom of the tube. Occasionally, the surface of the syringe might collect rat fur; take care not to allow any fur to enter the tube, as it can lead to clotting.\n4. Statistical analysis\nPresent all data as mean ± standard deviation and test them for homogeneity of variance.\nUse Fisher's exact test to compare the success rates between groups.\nUse a two-sample independent t-test to compare the overall means between the two groups.\nUse analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous measurements such as blood sampling time, body weight, food intake, and water consumption. Consider P < 0.05 statistically significant.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
