The first stage is the differentiation of hPSCs into keratinocyte progenitor-like cells by using retinoic acid (RA) to promote ectodermal fate (Bain et al., 1995[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) to block neural fate (Gambaro et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]), which together can induce epithelial differentiation from hPSCs.\nNote: Ensure the quality of hESCs before starting the differentiation by checking the cell morphology and expression of key pluripotency markers, such as OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2. The cells should have a confirmed normal karyotype, free of differentiated cells, and mycoplasma contamination.\nOn day 0, remove the culture medium from the cells and wash with 1 mL PBS to remove dead cells. Treat the cells with RelesR for 4–5 min at 37°C, then remove ReLeSR and detach the cells with media by gentle pipetting. Collect the cells in a 15 mL Falcon tube, centrifuge at 130 g for 5 min at 22°C and plate on Geltrex (1:100) coated plates as small clumps in mTeSR1 containing 10 μM Rock inhibitor. Split one confluent well of 6-well plate into two wells of a 6-well plate (1:2 ratio) to attain a confluency of 90–100% next day. The cells can be maintained in culture until they reach 90–100% confluency.\nRemove the hESC medium and wash the cells with 1 mL of DMEM/F12 basal medium. Start the differentiation by adding 2.5 mL of unconditioned medium (UCM) supplemented with 1 μM RA and 20 ng/mL BMP4.\nContinue to culture the cells for five days in UCM containing 1 μM RA and 20 ng/mL BMP4 with media change every day.",
    "On day 5, treat the cells with ReLeSR for 4–5 min at 37°C, and then completely remove the dissociating reagent. Dissociate the cells with media and pipette gently to make small clumps of approximately 10–20 cells, centrifuge at 130 g for 5 min at 22°C, and plate the cells at 1:2 ratio onto Geltrex-coated plates. For RNA extraction and immunostaining, one well of 6-well is splitted into 4 wells of a 12-well plate and 3 wells of a 24-well plate. Add 10 μM Rock inhibitor during passaging the cells in addition to RA and BMP4.\nSwitch the media stepwise from UCM to N2 medium. On day 6, mix UCM and N2 medium at 1:1 ratio and add to the cells for stepwise transition. Change the media completely to N2 medium on day 7 and continue to treat the cells with RA and BMP4 until day 8 with media change every day.\nOn day 8, withdraw RA and BMP4 and add 10 ng/mL EGF to the N2 medium.\nContinue to culture the cells until day 14 with media change every day to differentiate the cells into keratinocyte progenitors (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1885-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Scale bar = 100 μm.\nOn day 14, check the keratinocyte progenitor cells for the expression of progenitor markers using RT-PCR and immunostaining (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B). Extract RNA from one well of a 12-well plate to check the expression of progenitor markers and use the cells grown in a 24-well plate for immunostaining.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1885-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Scale bar = 100 μm.\nDifferentiation of keratinocyte progenitor cells into mature keratinocyte-like cells\nTiming: ∼2 weeks\nOn day 14, wash the keratinocyte progenitor cells with 1 mL PBS and treat with TrypLE for 8–10 min at 37°C. Gently remove the TrypLE and detach the cells with N2 medium. Following centrifugation at 130 g for 5 min at 22°C, plate the cells at 1:2 ratio onto Geltrex coated plate. Add 10 μM Rock inhibitor to the fresh media during passaging the cells.\nOn day 15, withdraw the Rock inhibitor and add N2 medium containing 10 ng/mL EGF.\nContinue to grow the cells in N2 medium containing 10 ng/mL EGF for 8-days with media change every other day.\nOn day 23, add 1.2 mM CaCl2 to the N2 medium containing 10 ng/mL EGF for one week to induce maturation of keratinocytes and change media every other day.\nOn day 30, check the expression of mature keratinocyte markers using Western blotting and immunostaining. The mature keratinocytes can be passaged and kept in culture until day 45 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nFor passaging keratinocytes, treat the cells with TrypLE for 4–5 min at 37°C. Gently remove the TrypLE and detach the cells with N2 medium. Following centrifugation at 130 g for 5 min at 22°C, culture the keratinocytes onto Geltrex coated plates in N2 medium containing 10 ng/mL EGF. Change the culture media every other day until day 45 (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1885-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.
