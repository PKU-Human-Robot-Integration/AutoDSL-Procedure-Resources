    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nBone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) are primary macrophage cells, derived from bone marrow cells in vitro in the presence of growth factors. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) is a lineage-specific growth factor responsible for the proliferation and differentiation of committed myeloid progenitors into macrophage/monocyte lineage cells.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nMajor step 1: Bone marrow isolation\nTiming: 1 h (n = 2 animals)\nDay 1\nExtraction of bone marrow cells from mice.\nEuthanize and dissect the mouse.\nSacrifice the mouse using a CO2 asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation.\nImmediately spray the mouse with 70% EtOH before dissection.\nUse surgical scissors and forceps to dissect the whole leg, from hip to ankle, and immediately soak the leg in 70% EtOH for 5 min in a 10-cm Petri dish.\nUse forceps and scissors to remove the skin and skeletal muscle tissue from the bone and wash the bone with cold PBS in a 10 cm Petri dish. Be careful not to cut bone as this will compromise the sterility of the bone marrow.\nPlace the bone in a new 10 cm Petri dish containing PBS and separate the femur and tibia by cutting at the knee joint.\nClean away any remaining tissue and wash again with PBS in a new dish.\nDiscard mouse carcass and all excess tissues according to institutional policy.\nNote: Bones must be thoroughly cleaned of skeletal muscle to avoid contamination from the tissue cells.\nExtract bone marrow from the femur and tibia.\nFill a 1-mL syringe with cold bone marrow isolation buffer (BMIB).\nBMIB: Add 1.5 mL FBS to 48.5 mL PBS (3% final concentration FBS)\nMake fresh prior to use and keep on ice.\nCut off the ends of the femur bone and gently insert a 27-gauge needle attached to the syringe into the marrow cavity.",
    "Flush the bone marrow into a 6-well plate or 10-cm Petri dish by expelling the BMIB through the cavity.\nFlush the bone from both ends using the 1-mL syringe with the cold BMIB.\nRefill the syringe with BMIB and repeat this step until you have flushed out all the bone marrow material into the 6 well plate or dish.\nRepeat the process for tibia bones or bones from additional animals.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3146-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Preparation and harvesting of bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs)\n(A) Mice tibia and femur before (left) and after (right) flushing the bone marrow.\n(B–D) (B) Bone marrow pellet (C) Cell suspension in RBC lysis buffer (D) Cell pellet after RBC lysis.\nNote: The color of the bone changes from dark red to white when the bone marrow is completely flushed out (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). The amount of bone marrow cells obtained depends on the mouse's age and genetic background. Usually, 6–8-week-old mice are ideal BM donors.\nCritical: It is essential to maintain sterility throughout this procedure. Perform the entire procedure a laminar flow hood, and use generous amounts of 70% EtOH to sterilize surgical equipment periodically.\nPrepare bone marrow cells for culture.\nGently pipette the mixture up and down several times using a pipette to homogenize the bone marrow.\nTransfer the solution into a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 500 g for 5 min at 4°C to pellet cells.\nAspirate and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in 1 mL Red Blood Cell Lysis Buffer and incubate for 3–5 min at room temperature to lyse red blood cells.\nAdd 9 mL of BMIB to neutralize the Red Blood Cell Lysis Buffer.\nCentrifuge at 500 g for 5 min at 4°C to pellet cells.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend cells in 5 mL BMIB.",
    "Pass the resuspended cell suspension through a 70-μm cell filter to get rid of cellular debris and clumps.\nNote: Pre-wet the cell strainer.\nCentrifuge at 500 g for 5 min at 4°C to pellet cells.\nNote: Pool together cells from all the animals to get a homogeneous cell population for the recipient animals.\nMajor step 2: Bone marrow culture and macrophage differentiation\nTiming: 7 days\nDay 1\nFollowing isolation of murine bone marrow, culture and differentiate macrophage progenitors into BMDMs.\nResuspend the cells from bone marrow in 5 mL of complete DMEM/F12 containing 10% LCM medium pre-warmed to 37°C, and gently mix the cell pellet.\nPrepare each 150 mm Petri dish with 25 mL DMEM/F12 containing 10% LCM medium.\nAdd 1 mL of cell suspension per dish and swirl to distribute the cells evenly in medium. Therefore, you will need five plates for each mouse.\nIncubate plates at 37°C in 5% CO2 atmosphere.\nSupplement with fresh media on day 3 by adding 15 mL DMEM/F12 containing 10% LCM medium pre-warmed to 37°C.\nReplace all media on day 6 with 25 mL fresh DMEM/F12 + 10% LCM. Check under a microscope to ensure that cells have a spindle-like appearance, which signifies that these cells are macrophages.\nOn Day 7, BMDMs are ready to harvest. At this stage, you may also treat BMDMs further to induce specific macrophage phenotypes.\nAspirate media from each plate.\nUse a cell lifter to scrape cells from the Petri dishes or add 5 mL of Cellstripper (Mediatech) per plate and incubate at 37°C for 10 min to allow the cells to lift off the plate.\nCollect the cell suspension and add 10 mL of DMEM/F12 medium to neutralize the Cellstripper.",
    "Centrifuge at 500 g for 5 min at 4°C to pellet cells. Resuspend the cell pellet in PBS or DMEM/F12 media and count the cell number using a hemocytometer.\nNote: The cell culture process will take a week, allowing the macrophage progenitors to attach to the adherent surface and divide until there is a confluent monolayer of macrophages.\nMajor step 3: Sciatic nerve crush\nTiming: 1 h\nDay 4\nSciatic nerve crush is a commonly used research technique to evaluate peripheral nerve regeneration. The axons are severed in this technique, while the epineurium and connective tissue are not disturbed.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6],7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7],8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]\nPerform the surgery in a sterile location to avoid any potential infection in mice.\nStart by cleaning the work area with 70% ethanol.\nPrepare the surgery area by placing a clean drape on a heating pad.\nAnesthetize adult mice (∼100 days old) with 2% isoflurane by nose cone.\nInject mice with analgesic, Meloxicam, at 2 mg/kg body weight subcutaneously.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes using sterile cotton-tipped applicators.\nCarefully shave both hindquarters using shavers. You may complete this step the day before to save time on the day of surgery.\nClean the skin with 70% ethanol Prep Pads, and betadine surgical scrub.\nCover the surgical field with a sterile drape. Sterilize all instruments by autoclave or hot bead sterilization and the surgeon wears a mask, gown, and sterile gloves.\nIncise the skin just below the lateral aspect of the femur bone (See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3146-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "(E) The crushed nerve is repositioned under muscle fascia and the skin incision is closed with 9 mm reflex clips.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S1. Full technique for sciatic nerve crush (related to steps 11–25)\n    \nOpen the fascial plane between the gluteus maximus and the anterior head of the biceps femoris with blunt scissors to reveal the sciatic nerve.\nGently free the sciatic nerve from the surrounding connective tissue without damaging or stretching the nerve.\nCrush the sciatic nerve with smooth forceps for 20 s at 3 clicks of the forceps—being careful not to stretch the nerve.\nNote: Following nerve crush, a pink line across the nerve will identify the crush site.\nPlace the nerve carefully back in its original position and close the muscle fascia.\nFinally, close the skin incision using 9 mm reflex clips. If 9 mm reflex clips restrict movement, one can use smaller reflex clips or 6-0 or absorbable sutures instead.\nPost-operative care\nFollowing the procedure, place animals on a heating pad at 37°C until they show signs of movement.\nNote: If a heating pad is unavailable, an infrared lamp can be used.\nAfter recovery, return animals to their home cage, where water and food are readily accessible on the floor in the form of Hydrogel and wet food.\nMajor step 4: Counting and preparing BMDMs for adoptive transfer\nTiming: 1 h\nDay 7\nDivide the bone marrow cells from one animal (see Step #3) into five 150 mm dishes for bone marrow differentiation. Keep the cells on ice.\nOn day 7, wash the cells with PBS, scrape in 5 mL of PBS using a cell lifter, and collect in 15 mL tubes.",
    "Spin the cells twice with PBS at 500 g for 5 min to eliminate any carry-over media and FBS, which can be immunogenic when injected into animals.\nPool the cells from all the tubes in one 15 mL tube and gently resuspend in 5 mL of PBS to make a homogeneous cell suspension.\nCount the cells using a hemocytometer.\nNote: Each animal yields around 15–20 million BMDMs. Ideally, cells isolated from each donor mouse will be sufficient to adoptive cell transfer into 3 recipient mice, though this depends on cell death during cell isolation or treatment, if any.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension again at 500 g for 5 min.\nResuspend the cells in PBS and gently mix the cells to produce a cell suspension such that each 100 μL contains 5 × 10ˆ6 cells.\nNote: Cells should be injected within 15 minutes once the cells are ready to avoid cell death.\nMajor step 5: Adoptive cell transfer of BMDMs\nTiming: 1 h\nDay 7\nSciatic nerve crush occurred on Day 4 of this protocol; thus, the nerves are now three days post-crush. At this time post-crush, there is maximal macrophage infiltration following injury to peripheral nerves.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9],10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]\nHeat tail regions of mice under the infrared lamp for 10–15 min to prepare them for injections, as heat from the infrared lamp dilates the lateral veins of the tail, facilitating the injection process.\nPrepare syringes with cells for injection and keep them on ice.\nMove a single mouse to the mouse retainer (See Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3146-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Setup and heat treatment using an infrared lamp for mouse tail-vein injection\n(A and B) Infrared lamp setup.\n(C) Setup for the tail vein injection with a phone flashlight and mouse restrainer.\n(D) A mouse is shown in restrainer.",
    "(E) Mouse tail vein visualized by trans-illumination.\nPull the tail towards the investigator, hold the syringe in your dominant hand, and position the syringe parallel to the tail. Insert the needle with the bevel up in the lateral vein, and slowly inject the cells (See Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nNote: Inject cells smoothly with minimal resistance. If there is resistance to the injection or white blisters appear above the injection site, withdraw the needle, and try a different injection site proximal to the first one. As the fluid will escape via the first site, do not inject distal to the initial injection site.\nInject each animal 100 μL of BMDM suspension (See step 31).\nRemove the needle and press firmly with the thumb to prevent backflow of the injected solution and blood. Apply gentle compression with a clean gauze/wipe or tissue until the bleeding has stopped.\nCritical: The mice should not be kept under the infrared lamp for more than 15 minutes, as mice are sensitive to overheating.\nNote: Keep two mice under the infrared lamp at a time.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S2.
