    "A schematic overview of this protocol is presented in Figure 1. In short, an in-vitro-transcribed short RNA is guanylylated using [α-32P]GTP to generate a Gp*ppRNA substrate, with the radiolabeled phosphate indicated by an asterisk. This GpppRNA substrate is briefly incubated with nuclear or cytoplasmic extracts (or other biological samples) and SAM. Different levels of cap methyltransferase activity in each extract will result in differential N7-methylation of the GpppRNA substrate to produce m7GpppRNA. The mixtures of GpppRNA and m7GpppRNA are then digested to individual nucleotides with P1 nuclease, leaving intact the radiolabeled cap dinucleotide structures that are finally analyzed by TLC and phosphorimaging.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180314/20180314010130_3079.jpgFigure 1. Schematic overview of cap methyltransferase activity assay Preparation of radiolabeled GpppRNA substrate for cap methyltransferase activity assay (see Note 3)Prepare a 30 μl mixture in a 0.2 ml PCR tube by combining the following: 15 μl of RNase-free water, 3 μl of 10x annealing buffer (see Recipes), 6 μl of 100 μM ssDNA sense oligo, 6 μl of 100 μM ssDNA antisense oligo.To denature and then slowly anneal the two oligos to create the dsDNA template for T3 transcription, place the mixture on a thermal cycler at 98 °C for 2 min, and ramp the temperature from 98 °C to 20 °C in 60 min (1.3 °C per min, down to 20 °C). Transfer this tube of dsDNA onto ice, and in a separate tube, prepare a 1 μM (1 pmol/μl) working stock by diluting it 20-fold with RNase-free water.Using the components provided in the MEGAscript T3 Transcription Kit, prepare a 20 μl reaction in a 0.",
    "2 ml PCR tube by combining in the following order: 6 μl of RNase-free water, 2 μl of 75 mM ATP, 2 μl of 75 mM CTP, 2 μl of 75 mM GTP, 2 μl of 75 mM UTP, 2 μl of 10x T3 reaction buffer, 2 μl of 1 μM dsDNA template, 2 μl of T3 RNA polymerase enzyme mix. Gently mix, and incubate at 37 °C for 16-24 h. This prolonged reaction time enables transcription of high yields of 32 nt 5’ triphosphate RNA (pppRNA).Bring the T3 transcription reaction product mixture to 50 μl by adding 30 μl of RNase-free water, and purify using a NucAway Spin Column according to manufacturer’s instructions.Measure the concentration of the purified pppRNA using a NanoDrop. In our experience, at least 7-8 μg of pppRNA should be recovered after a 24 h transcription reaction. Calculate the molar concentration of the pppRNA assuming a molecular mass of 10,830.3 g/mol.Further assess the purity of the pppRNA by 15% polyacrylamide urea-PAGE. As little as 150 fmol (1.6 ng) of pppRNA per lane should be sufficient to visualize under UV light after post-staining the gel with SYBR Gold at a dilution of 1:20,000 in 1x TBE. The pppRNA should run as a single band at the expected size.The pppRNA should be stored in small aliquots at -20 °C or -80 °C to avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.To prepare a 40 μl capping (guanylylation) reaction, combine in order the following components in a 1.7 ml tube on ice: RNase-free water (for 40 μl total volume), 10 μl of 4x capping buffer (see Recipes), 1 μl of RNaseOUT, 4.8 pmol of 32 nt pppRNA, 2 pmol of recombinant capping enzyme (see Note 1), 24 pmol (total GTP) of [α-32P]GTP (see Note 4).",
    "Gently mix and incubate at 30 °C for 3 h, then heat-inactivate by incubating at 65 °C for 10 min.Transfer 1.33 μl (1/30) of the capping reaction product to a new tube on ice to save as ‘input’ for scintillation counting. Bring the capping reaction to 50 μl by adding 11.33 μl of RNase-free water. Purify the RNA using the Zymo RNA Clean & Concentrator-5 kit according to manufacturer’s instructions, using 30 μl of RNase-free water for the final elution step. Return the purified RNA to ice, and transfer 1 μl (1/30) to a new tube on ice for scintillation counting.Mix the set-aside 1/30 capping reaction ‘input’ and purified RNA samples each with 1.5 ml of ScintiSafe Econo 1 scintillation fluid and transfer to scintillation vials. Measure the radioactivity in each mixture by scintillation counting. Determine the concentration of purified [32P]G-capped RNA according to the following equation: [GpppRNA] (in μM) = (24 pmol) x (purified counts/input counts)/(30 μl).The purified [32P]G-capped RNA may be stored at -20 °C but should be used within a few days to limit radioactive decay. Be sure to account for radioactive decay when determining the appropriate amount to use in the cap methyltransferase activity assay.Preparation of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts of mammalian cellsTwo to three days in advance, seed 10-cm or 15-cm dishes with U2OS, HEK293, or other type of adherent mammalian cells such that the dishes will be ~80-90% confluent at the time of harvesting. U2OS cells should be grown in McCoy’s 5A medium containing 10% (v/v) FBS; HEK293 cells should be grown in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) FBS. Cells should be grown in an incubator set to 37 °C with 5% CO2.",
    "On the day of harvesting the cells, prepare YO Lysis Buffer and YO Buffer A (see Recipes) on ice, leaving out the DTT, PMSF, protease inhibitor cocktail, and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails until immediately before using the buffers.Remove culture medium from adherent cells, rinse with PBS and remove, and then harvest by scraping into 1 ml of PBS and transferring to 1.7 ml centrifuge tubes. Gently pellet the cells (70 x g for 10 min at 4 °C), and then carefully remove the supernatant PBS by aspiration. Make note of the approximate volume of the cell pellets, and place the tubes on ice.For the preparation of cytoplasmic extracts, immediately add YO Lysis Buffer equivalent to 4-5 times the volume of each cell pellet. Gently resuspend the cells with 10 up-down strokes of a P1000 pipet. Incubate the cells on ice for 10 min, and then mix with 5 additional up-down strokes of the P1000 pipet. Pellet nuclei (16,100 x g for 10 min at 4 °C), and then transfer the cytoplasmic extract supernatants to new, pre-chilled 1.7 ml tubes on ice.Carefully remove any residual cytoplasmic extract from the nuclear pellets using a P10 pipet. To prepare nuclear extracts, add 4-5 original-cell-pellet volumes of YO Buffer A, and resuspend each nuclear pellet with 15 up-down strokes of a P200 pipet. Incubate the tubes end-over-end at 4 °C for 20 min, and then pellet nuclear debris (16,100 x g for 5 min at 4 °C). Transfer the nuclear extract supernatants to new, pre-chilled 1.7 ml tubes on ice.Measure the concentration of protein in each extract by Bradford assay, using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye Reagent Concentrate according to manufacturer’s instructions and using a standard curve of bovine serum albumin (BSA) at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 μg/ml.",
    "Diluting the extracts 250- to 500-fold in the 1x dye reagent typically gives measurements within the linear range of the assay. Using a program such as Microsoft Excel, calculate the protein concentrations using the best-fit line of the BSA standard curve.For the cap methyltransferase activity assay, prepare 15-20 μl samples of each extract in new, pre-chilled tubes on ice. If comparing nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts, it is critical to ensure that these are in the same buffer composition. This can be accomplished by first bringing the extracts all to the same protein concentration (typically 0.5-1.0 μg/μl; such calculations can be greatly aided by software such as Microsoft Excel) with the same buffer used prior (i.e., YO Lysis Buffer for cytoplasmic extracts and YO Buffer A for nuclear extracts) and then mixing each sample with an equal volume of the other buffer (i.e., YO Buffer A for cytoplasmic extracts and YO Lysis Buffer for nuclear extracts). Store these extract samples in small aliquots at -80 °C.Assess the quality of subcellular fractionation by running the nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. The use of nuclear and cytoplasmic control antibodies (e.g., against nucleolin and tubulin) can determine whether cross-contamination occurred during the fractionation procedure. For an example of expected Western blot results, see Figure 1C of Trotman et al., 2017.Preparation of TLC plate for cap methyltransferase activity assayWearing clean gloves, use a clean ruler and scissors to cut a 20 x 20 cm PEI cellulose TLC plate into four 10 x 10 cm squares. We recommend using clean forceps to handle the plate to limit contact with any contaminants that may be present on gloves. Store any unused plates at 4 °C. See Note 2 regarding TLC performance.",
    "Use the ruler and a pencil to lightly draw a faint, straight line (origin) 1.5 cm from the bottom edge of a 10 x 10 cm plate. Draw faint tick marks on the origin 1 cm apart to indicate where samples will be spotted. An example TLC plate is shown in Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180314/20180314010620_5220.jpgFigure 2. Example of TLC plate preparationPre-run the TLC plate with RNase-free water. To do so, fill a rectangular glass TLC chamber with just enough water to cover the bottom (approximately 60 ml in the model listed above) such that the water depth does not exceed 0.75 cm. Using long forceps, gently place the TLC plate upright in the water. Take care to ensure that the left and right edges enter the water simultaneously, as this will promote even migration of water up the TLC plate. This pre-running step forces contaminants to the top of the TLC plate and greatly improves performance for the subsequent chromatographic analysis of the cap methyltransferase activity assay samples.Once water has reached the top of the TLC plate, remove the TLC plate from the chamber and allow it to air-dry. Shaking the plate by hand or using a commercial hair dryer (without heating) can help speed up this process.Pre-run TLC plates can be stored at 4 °C for at least 2 weeks.Cap methyltransferase activity assayAfter thawing components on ice, prepare 10 μl cap methyltransferase reactions in 1.7 ml tubes on ice by combining the following in order: RNase-free water (for 10 μl total volume), 1 μl of 10x cap methylation buffer (see Recipes), 1 μl of 1 μM SAM, 1 μl of 20 mM DTT, 1 μl of RNaseOUT, nuclear or cytoplasmic extract for 1 μg of total protein, 5 fmol of [32P]G-capped RNA.",
    "Using a master mix of the reaction components (omitting the extracts) is recommended if working with a large number of extract samples. Gently mix, incubate at 37 °C for 30 min, and then immediately return to ice.Add 40 μl of RNase-free water to each tube and purify the RNA samples using the Zymo Clean & Concentrator-5 kit according to manufacturer’s instructions, using 7 μl RNase-free water for the final elution step. Place the purified RNA on ice.Prepare 7 μl P1 nuclease digestion reactions in 1.7 ml tubes on ice by combining the following in order: 5.0 μl of purified RNA from cap methyltransferase reactions, 0.6 μl of RNase-free water, 0.7 μl of 500 mM sodium acetate pH 5.2, 0.7 μl of 0.625 U/μl P1 nuclease. Gently mix and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min. The samples may now be stored at -20 °C or analyzed immediately.On the 1 cm tick marks on the origin of a pre-run PEI cellulose TLC plate, carefully spot 1 μl of the P1 nuclease digestion products using a P10 pipet. Allow the spots to completely air-dry, and then spot an additional 1 μl of the P1 digestion products on the same positions as before. As controls, also spot 2 μl (1 μl at a time) of 10 mM GpppG and 10 mM m7GpppG standards on a separate tick mark or marks (see Note 5).After allowing the spots to completely air-dry, use long forceps to evenly place the TLC plate upright in a rectangular TLC chamber containing approximately 60 ml 0.4 M ammonium sulfate mobile phase. Allow the mobile phase to develop upward, approximately 6-7 cm beyond the origin, and then remove the TLC plate from the chamber.",
    "Allow the TLC plate to completely air-dry, which can be sped up by hand-shaking or using a hair dryer without heat.Wearing proper eye and skin protection, observe the TLC plate under a handheld 254 nm UV light to determine the positions of the GpppG and m7GpppG standards. These can be noted by marking their positions with a pencil or by taking a photo with a handheld camera.Wrap the TLC plate in plastic wrap so that the front side is covered by one layer. Place the TLC plate in a storage phosphor screen cassette, taping the top edge to the cassette to keep it in place. Place a recently light-erased storage phosphor screen over the TLC plate, close the cassette, and expose at room temp for at least 16 h for maximum signal.Remove the TLC plate from the cassette and image the storage phosphor screen with a Typhoon imager set to phosphor mode. Typical results are shown in Figure 3.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180314/20180314010801_5702.jpgFigure 3. Typical phosphor image results. To demonstrate reproducibility, four technical replicates of the described activity assay were performed with U2OS cell nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts."
