    "Proteins used for unwinding assaysRecombinant human Twinkle helicase with a C-terminal His6-affinity tag was overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) Codon Plus-RIPL (Stratagene). The Twinkle helicase was purified to >95% purity using successive nickel-affinity, anion exchange, and heparin-affinity chromatography (Longley et al., 2010;        Kaur et al., 2020). Twinkle helicase protein concentration was evaluated using Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels with BSA standards (Krieg et al., 2005; He, 2011). For a detailed purification protocol, see       Longley et al. (2010)      . Human mtSSB protein was overexpressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (Longley et al., 2009).DNA substrates for the unwinding assaysDNA substrate – Gapped circular DNA substrate (4,060 bp) – was prepared by introducing two clusters of four closely spaced nicks in one strand of pscwo1 plasmid (Addgene: plasmid # 72300) using Nt.BstNBI. These circular substrates were incubated with complementary oligos (Integrated DNA Technologies, IDT) (oligo: plasmid – 10:1 ratio) at 68°C for 30 min, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Amicon Ultrafiltration was used to remove excess oligonucleotides and short duplex DNA. Diagnostic restriction digestion was used to evaluate the gapping efficiency (85-95%). Linear gapped DNA substrate for AFM studies was generated by digesting the circular gapped DNA with ScaI restriction enzyme using Buffer 3.1 (Countryman et al., 2018; Kaur et al., 2018; Kaur et al., 2020).AFM imaging in air to study DNA unwinding by Twinkle helicaseUsing AFM imaging in air, protein-DNA samples are incubated and deposited on a sample surface. These samples are then imaged in air, and the scanning AFM tip captures a snapshot of the protein-DNA static structure-function information at the incubated time. Furthermore, time titration of the protein-DNA sample can provide information on how the protein-DNA interaction changes with respect to incubated time.",
    "Prepare freshly cleaved mica surfaces by peeling a layer of mica off using scotch tape.Measure the concentration of the purified gapped DNA using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. DNA concentration is estimated by measuring the absorbance at a wavelength of 260 nm (A260) using a spectrophotometer. The absorbance of double-stranded DNA at a concentration of 50 µg/ml is 1 and follows a linear relationship with concentration. Using this relationship, we can formulate the unknown DNA concentration as:DNA concentration (to be measured in µg/ml) = 50 µg/ml × A260 Incubate Twinkle helicase (71.2 nM hexamers) with circular gapped DNA (3.6 nM) in Helicase Imaging Buffer for 1 min at room temperature. Increasing the Twinkle helicase: circular gapped DNA ratio can lead to an increased molar ratio of Twinkle per DNA molecule, causing more Twinkle helicase hexamers to unwind the same DNA molecule. Based on the extent of unwinding required and the number of unwinding sites, the ratio and incubation time can be adjusted.Dilute the incubated sample 10-fold in Helicase Imaging Buffer (final volume 20 µl) and deposit the sample directly onto the freshly cleaved mica surface. There is no limitation on the volume of the sample, but there is a limitation on the concentration of the sample as you are performing single molecule studies. Overcrowded samples cannot provide clear information as it is difficult to observe single molecules trajectories. Therefore, the concentration of the sample on the surface should be adjusted accordingly, so that single molecules are clearly identifiable.Wash the deposited samples three times with Helicase Imaging Buffer (300-500 µl) followed by three times with DI water (300-500 µl) and dry the sample with streams of N2 gas before AFM imaging.Open the MFP3D software and select the standard tab > AC air topography mode from the mode master tab (Figure 3).",
    "Load the AFM probe (Pointprobe PPP-FMR probes) on the cantilever holder (Figure 4) and align the position of the laser plot to get maximum SUM signal (laser intensity) and zero deflection. While mounting the AFM tip on the cantilever holder, do not push too far back inside as this can result in misalignment of the AFM tip.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4139/bioprotoc-11-17-4139-g004.jpgFigure 4.

Follow this order of addition to the incubated samples: Helicase Imaging Buffer, circular gapped DNA, and Twinkle and mtSSB simultaneously.",
    "Higher concentrations of mtSSB are observed to facilitate the unwinding reaction.Dilute the samples 10-fold in Helicase Imaging Buffer (final volume 20 µl) and deposit directly onto the freshly cleaved mica surface.Wash the deposited samples with Helicase Imaging Buffer (300-500 µl) three times followed by DI water (300-500 µl) three times and dry the sample with streams of N2 gas prior to AFM imaging.Image the sample deposited onto a mica surface using AC mode on MFP-3D-Bio AFM with Pointprobe PPP-FMR probes (Nanosensors, k = 2.8 N/m, fr = 70 kHz) as described in the previous section (Figures 1-3).Capture the images at a scan rate of 1-2 Hz and a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels.AFM imaging in liquids to capture real-time dynamics of Twinkle helicase on circular gapped DNATo elucidate the dynamics of protein-DNA interactions, time lapse buffer imaging of the protein-DNA is done. In this mode of AFM imaging, the protein and DNA are not bound strongly to the surface and have restricted freedom to move around while imaging of the sample by the AFM tip in a layer of respective buffer (100-200 µl). This helps to visualize the dynamics of the protein-DNA interactions in real time as the tip is scanning across the sample surface in the native state.Prepare a freshly cleaved mica surface by peeling a layer of mica off the scotch tape.Deposit 30 µl of the APS working solution and incubate for 15 min.Wash the APS solution with DI water (300-500 µl) three times and dry with streams of N2 gas.Check the concentration of the purified gapped DNA using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer.Incubate 0.7 nM circular gapped DNA onto the APS treated mica surface for 15 min. Wash the deposited DNA with Helicase Imaging Buffer (300-500 µl). Add 100-200 µl of Helicase Imaging Buffer to the washed sample.",

    "The setpoint was adjusted approximately between 0.4-0.55 V.Images were captured at a scan rate of 2-4 Hz and a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels.
