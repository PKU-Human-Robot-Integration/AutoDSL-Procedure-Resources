    "Preparation for primary Schwann cell cultures from neonatal rat Prepare the culture plate: coat 3.5 cm cell culture dishes with 1 mL of PLL solution (0.1 mg/mL). Incubate overnight at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator.Note: Percentage of CO2 is not important at this time. This step is just to increase the adhesion of the cell dishes. Next day, remove the PLL solution, thoroughly rinse the dish surface with distilled water, and air dry before use. Pipette 1.5 mL of cold PBS into each dish and place them on ice.Prepare culture media and solutions:(1) Medium A for cell proliferation (culture medium to expand Schwann cells): DMEM/F12 containing 3% FBS, 3 μM forskolin, 10 ng/mL heregulin β-1, and 100 mg/mL penicillin–streptomycin.(2) Medium B for cell starvation: DMEM/F12 containing 1% FBS and 100 mg/mL penicillin–streptomycin.(3) Medium C for Schwann cell differentiation: DMEM/F12 containing 1% FBS, 100 mg/mL penicillin–streptomycin, and 1 mM dbcAMP.(4) Medium D for Schwann cell dedifferentiation: DMEM/F12 containing 1% FBS and 100 mg/mL penicillin–streptomycin.Note: Media should be made fresh just before use. Culture of primary Schwann cells from rat spinal nerves Note: This part refers to a previous study (Wen et al., 2017).Prepare surgical equipment (see Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4631/bioprotoc-13-05-4631-g001.jpgFigure 1. Surgical equipment used in this protocol Tissue collection: anesthetize the neonatal rat by putting it on ice for 2–3 min, sterilize with 75% ethanol, decapitate with surgical scissors and forceps, put the head into a collection bag, and collect the sciatic and spinal nerves with superfine forceps.Tissue digestion: prepare one 1.5 mL tube with 1 mL of PBS and keep chilled on ice. Transfer these nerves to the 1.5 mL tube and cut them with a spring scissor into small 1-mm-long pieces; then, add 1 mL of pre-warmed 0.25% trypsin-EDTA into the tube.",
    "Cap the tube and incubate at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator for 30 min with intermittent vibration every 10 min.Collect cells by centrifugation: add 100 μL of FBS to stop digestion and then gently triturate the cell sample 30 times using a 1 mL pipette to make a single cell suspension. Then, centrifuge the cell suspension at 100 × g for 5 min at room temperature and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the cell pellet in 200 μL of 10% FBS in DMEM/F12, plant the cell suspension in the middle of the PLL-coated 3.5 cm dish, and culture the cells in a CO2 incubator for 1–2 h to ensure cell attachment. Add 1 mL of 10% FBS to the dish and culture the cells for 24 h.Note: The cell suspension at this point is a mixture of Schwann cells and fibroblasts (see Figure 2A).Purification: replace the culture medium with DMEM/F12 containing 10% FBS and 10 μM Ara-C (add 1 μL of 10 mM Ara-C stock solution per 1 mL of medium) to eliminate the fibroblasts. After 48 h, replace the culture medium with Medium A of rat Schwann cells.Note: After purification, approximately 1 × 104 Schwann cells should be obtained from one rat. When 100% confluent after expansion, the number of Schwann cells per dish should be approximately 1 × 105–2 × 105 (see Figure 2B).Cell passage: when the culture reaches 90% confluency, wash the cells with 1 mL of PBS, discard PBS washes, and add 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA into the cell dishes for 2 min at room temperature. Observe the cells under a phase contrast microscope while gently shaking the culture dish. When the cells start to drop from the dish, add 1 mL of 10% FBS to stop digestion, collect the cells in a 1.",
    "5 mL tube, centrifuge for 5 min at 100 × g at room temperature, discard the supernatant, and gently resuspend the cells in 1 mL complete growth medium of rat Schwann cells.Note: Cells are passaged at a ratio of 1:3–1:4 to expand and cells from the third passage are used for further experiments (see Figure 2C).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4631/bioprotoc-13-05-4631-g002.jpgFigure 2. Rat Schwann cells’ purification and expansion. (A) Cells 24 h after dissection; the cultures should consist of Schwann cells and fibroblasts. Schwann cells have an elongated, spindle-shaped morphology, whereas fibroblasts are very flat. (B) On day 3, purified Schwann cells at confluence. (C) After being expanded in complete growth medium for two days and routinely passaged to the third passage in complete growth medium in the presence of forskolin and heregulin β-1, the culture is populated with Schwann cells (>95% confluence), with their characteristic bipolar, spindle-shaped cell bodies.Differentiation and dedifferentiation of Schwann cells (Figure 3) Seed and starvation: seed 5,000 Schwann cells in a 3.5 cm dish (covered with glass coverslips, for immunofluorescence analysis) or seed 1 × 105 Schwann cells in a 6 cm dish (for western blotting analysis) in Medium A to allow a fast expansion of the cell population. After one day, remove the complete growth medium and rapidly replace it with an equal volume of Medium B overnight to adapt to the lack of mitogenic stimulation.Note: Complete growth medium (Medium A) of Schwann cells containing forskolin will induce Schwann cells to acquire a differentiated phenotype, and 10% FBS will induce Schwann cells to proliferate rather than differentiate. Differentiation: remove the starvation medium from each dish by gentle aspiration, replace it with an equal volume of Medium C and culture the cells in a CO2 incubator for 72 h.",
    "Observe the cultures of dbcAMP-differentiated Schwann cells under the phase contrast microscope to confirm the expected morphological changes prior to applying a dedifferentiating treatment.Note: After approximately 6 h, you can start to see the morphological changes in rat Schwann cells. It is recommended to include cultures maintained without forskolin and dbcAMP from the outset to serve as controls. To maintain Schwann cells differentiated for an extended period of time, simply carry out a medium replacement using new differentiation conditional medium. Dedifferentiation: after 72 h, the Schwann cells have differentiated in response to dbcAMP treatment. To induce dedifferentiation, simply replace the culture medium with Medium D, and culture the cells in a CO2 incubator for 24 h. Proceed to collect or analyze the cultures on the second day after dbcAMP withdrawal or as needed according to the experimental design.Note: dbcAMP-induced differentiated Schwann cells cannot dedifferentiate when exposed to growth factors such as forskolin and heregulin β-1. Thus, it is recommended to use a medium that does not contain forskolin and heregulin β-1 throughout the differentiation and dedifferentiation assays. Approximately 6 h after dbcAMP removal, nearly half of rat Schwann cells return to a bipolar or tripolar shape. You may add a drug or perform virus transfection before the dedifferentiation assay. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4631/bioprotoc-13-05-4631-g003.jpgFigure 3. Differentiation and dedifferentiation system of rat Schwann cells. Schwann cells are expanded in Medium A for several days, after which the third-passage cells are replated at an appropriate density and starved overnight in Medium B. The next day, the cells are treated with 1 mM dbcAMP, which induces morphological change and upregulation of differentiation markers that can be examined by phase contrast microscope observation, immunofluorescence, or western blotting. After 72 h, simply replace the culture medium with Medium D to induce Schwann cell dedifferentiation.",
