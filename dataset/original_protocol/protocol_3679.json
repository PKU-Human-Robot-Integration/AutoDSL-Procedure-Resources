    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCell digestion and seeding—day 1\nTiming: 1–2 h\nTiming: 10 min for steps 1 and 2\nTiming: 10 min for step 3\nTiming: 10 min for step 4\nTiming: 20 min for step 5\nTiming: 30 min for step 6\nPassage cells at log phase during which the cells are actively dividing, healthy and ≥ 90% viable. If the cells are adherent cells, culture the cells to achieve a dense monolayer.\nDiscard the culture medium, gently shake the cell bottle, and discard the dead cells or aging cells with poor adherence.\nAdd preheated trypsin-EDTA (0.25%) to the cells and hold at almost 18°C–25°C until cells become shrunk and round (after almost 3 to 5 min).\nNeutralize trypsin-EDTA by adding the preheated complete medium until almost half of the cells become suspended when tapping the edge of the culture bottle with your hand. The volume of preheated complete medium was twice that of trypsin-EDTA.\nCount cells using hemocytometer or other automated cell counters and cell analyzers such as the CountStar system.\nSeed the cells into 6-well plate at a density of 3 to 7 × 105 cells/well, depending on the doubling time. Add medium to a final volume of 2 mL/well. Incubate the cells in a normoxic CO2 incubator for 12 h.\nCritical: This protocol certainly does not only apply to 6-well plate. If the cells are relatively slow to grow, or if the users could not afford 6-well plate cell counts, it is suggested to choose other plates, but these plates should be used in proportion to the number of cells. To our knowledge, the number of cells required for each sample point to achieve meaningful measurement should be no less than 7 × 104 in 24-well plate.",
    "Alternatives: After the cells attached, plasmid or siRNA transfection may be performed if the expression of a gene needs to be modulated\nNote: Lipo3000 is not the only transfection agents but our preferred agents, other transfection methods can also be used.\nChange the cell culture media to 1750 μL fresh media with FBS per well.\nDilute 2.5 μg plasmid in 125 μL Opti-MEMTM media within a 1.5 mL tube (Tube 1).\nAdd 5 μL P3000TM from LipofectamineTM 3000 Kit into Tube 1.\nDilute 3.75 μL LipofectamineTM 3000 in 125 μL Opti-MEMTM media in another 1.5 mL tube (Tube 2).\nIncubate at almost 18°C–25°C for 10 min.\nAdd the plasmid-p3000TM mixture in Tube 1 to Tube 2.\nAdd plasmid-Lipofectamine 3000-p3000TM mixture into the well.\nCritical: Viral infections including human immunodeficiency virus result in increased ROS production (Schwarz, 1996[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]), which is essential to viral replication (Cheng et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). We observed this phenomenon in cells infected with control lentivirus that is still unstable to quantify mROS. Under these conditions, cells under normoxic conditions exhibit an abnormally high level of mROS, just like hypoxic cells. We therefore recommend using cells that have been stably passaged for at least three generations.\nDivide the cells into the hypoxic group (1% O2, 5% CO2, 94% N2) and the normoxic group (21% O2, 5% CO2, 74% N2) and place them in corresponding incubator for the time as required by the experiment. The photos of incubator settings can be seen as Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]. The approximate incubation time to induce mROS under the hypoxic condition could be detected between 10 min to 72 h.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/606-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Photos of normoxic settings and hypoxic settings",
    "Normoxic settings in incubator are as follows: Temp: 37°C, CO2: 5%, and O2: 21% (Left); Hypoxic settings in incubator are as follows: Temp: 37°C, CO2: 5%, and O2: 1% (Right).\nCritical: During hypoxic treatment, the frequency and duration of door openings should be limited as much as possible. Otherwise, intermittent hypoxia may cause the level of mROS to be unstable and uneven, thus leading to general underestimation of mROS. If multiple door openings are necessary, consider using a hypoxia incubator chamber that is self-contained and sealed inside a normal CO2 incubator. This equipment has advantages for allowing the cells to return to a stable hypoxic environment as soon as possible if the door is opened.\nMitoSOX staining and flow cytometry—day 4\nTiming: 2–3 h\nTiming: 10 min for step 8\nTiming: 10 min for step 9\nTiming: 20 min for step 10\nTiming: 20 min for step 11\nTiming: 10 min for step 12\nTiming: 20 min for step 13\nTiming: 20 min for step 14\nTiming: 30 min for steps 15 and 16\nObserve the (transfected) cells under a (fluorescence) microscope to estimate confluence (and the transfected efficiency).\nPrepare 5 mM MitoSOX reagent stock solution. Each MitoSOX vial should be placed at almost 18°C–25°C before opening. After centrifugation at 1000 g of the vial for 1 min, dissolve the contents (50 μg) of one vial of MitoSOX in 13 μL of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to make a 5 mM MitoSOX reagent stock solution.\nNote: We recommend that DMSO should use molecular biology grade.",
    "Collect normoxic cells with 1 mL preheated medium without serum or preheated Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS) into flow cytometry tubes. Collect hypoxic cells with 1 mL hypoxia-pretreated medium (See the 4th step in before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]) into flow cytometry tubes. If the cells are adherent cells, digest cells with preheated trypsin-EDTA for 3–5 min and washed cells 3 times with preheated medium/HBSS or hypoxia-pretreated medium during which cells should centrifugated each time at 400 g for 3 min at almost 18°C–25°C .\nCount cells using hemocytometer or other automated cell counters and cell analyzers, and adjust cells to a concentration of 1–5 × 106 cells per 1 mL in the corresponding medium.\nCritical: The cell concentration should be in this range, and specific value of concentration can be determined according to the recommendation from the users’ flow cytometry.\nAdd the 1 μL of MitoSOX stock solution to each cell suspension to make a 5 μM MitoSOX reagent working solution and shake gently.\nCritical: The concentration of the MitoSOX reagent working solution should not exceed 5 μM, as concentrations exceeding 5 μM can produce cytotoxic effects, including altered mitochondrial morphology and redistribution of fluorescence to nuclei and the cytosol. It is important to note that too many cells lead to a deficiency of the dye relative to each cell and thus low fluorescence. We recommend that cells should be diluted at a density of 5 × 106 cells/mL before staining.\nCritical: The remaining working solution can be stored at 4 °C in a refrigerator, protected from light for almost one week.\nCritical: Prepare one tube of cells as a negative control by adding the same amount of DMSO.\nIncubate the cells for 20 min in a normoxic incubator or hypoxic incubator, protected from light.",
    "Critical: The incubation of cells with MitoSOX should last 15 min to 30 min at 37°C. The methods also required that the buffer is preheated to 37°C, otherwise the staining will not be sufficient.\nWash cells gently three times with preheated medium/HBSS or hypoxia-pretreated medium as soon as possible. During washing, cells should centrifugated each time at 400 g for 3 min at almost 18°C –25°C . Prepare cells for flow cytometry.\nThe expression of MitoSOX is quantified in the PE channel by flow cytometry.\nCritical: Compensation can be calculated using single-stained cells if the cells are labeled with FITC or other fluorescence excited at 510 nm and detected at 580 nm.\nCritical: If the cells are detected under sterile conditions, cells can also be sorted for cell culture.\nCritical: An optimal sequence for sample measurement would be from low ROS to high, such as from normoxic samples to hypoxic samples. The recommended positive control samples can be the cells that are treated with lasting hypoxia, virus like lentivirus, or ROS-activating inhibitors like retenone. The recommended negative control samples can be the cells under normal culturing (21% O2, 5% CO2).\nPerform data analysis using FlowJo software."
