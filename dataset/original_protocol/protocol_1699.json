    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nWhole cell lysate preparation – day 1\nTiming: 1–1.5 h\nCells are harvested and lysed for subsequent ultracentrifugation on sucrose cushion.\nGrow MV4-11 cells with IMDM modified medium (10% fetal bovine serum) in the culture flask at 37°C and 5% CO2 to the desired number. Start culture at 1∗105–2∗105cells/mL and maintain between 1∗105 and 1∗106 cells/mL.\nCritical: If necessary, diluting the cells or passage the cells to a new flask to keep the cells on log phase at the day before starting the experiment. The polysome peak of over confluent cells that are less proliferative will not appear as robust because proliferation and translation rate are closely correlated (Johnson et al., 1976[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nTreat the cells with 100 μg/mL cycloheximide. After gentle shaking to mix thoroughly, incubate the cells in the culture flask at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 15 min.\nNote: For suspension cells, it is recommended to count the desired number of cells before cycloheximide treatment. Too fewer cells may produce small peaks and weak signals below the detection threshold.\nNote: Cycloheximide is a translation elongation inhibitor and used to prevent translating RNA from running off (Schneider-Poetsch et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). The cycloheximide treatment duration should be optimized for different cell lines. Preliminary experiments are needed to screen for the optimal cycloheximide concentration to generate robust polysome peaks.\nHarvest and wash cells with ice-cold PBS supplemented with 100 μg/mL cycloheximide.\nCollect cells in the culture with a 50 mL falcon tube and centrifuge the sample at 500 × g for 3 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and wash the cells with ice-cold PBS supplemented with 100 μg/mL cycloheximide.\nCentrifuge the cells at 500 × g for 3 min at 4°C. Repeat the wash step one more time.",
    "Centrifuge the cells at 500 × g for 3 min at 4°C. Remove the supernatant as much as possible with precaution. Aspiration with a vacuum pump is preferred.\nNote: Keep the samples and solution on ice all the time. Make sure that all the items and reagents are ready to use so that the experiment can proceed quickly without haste. Leaving cells on ice for too long will result in suboptimal quality of polysome preparation.\nPause point: Cell pellets may be flash frozen in the liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until use. However, it is always recommended to use fresh cells for the subsequent analysis.\nSuspend the cell pellets by gently pipetting in 200–300 μL lysis buffer supplemented with 40 U/mL RNase inhibitor, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, and 100 μg/mL cycloheximide. Immediately place the sample on ice for 30 min with occasional inverting to facilitate cell lysis.\nNote: The amount of lysis buffer used is adjusted according to the cell number. Prepare excessive amount of fresh lysis buffer in advance and settle the buffer in the refrigerator at 4°C for a period of time to reduce bubbles caused by detergent.\nCentrifuge the cell lysate at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Transfer the supernatant to a new pre-chilled 1.5 mL tube. Place the tube on ice until use.\nPause point: Alternatively, the cell lysate may be flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for a month. However, fresh cell lysates are always recommended.\nNote: Avoid the contamination by precipitations at the bottom when transferring supernatant. It is recommended to immediately load the lysis on sucrose cushion as this will improve the quality of the preparation.\nSucrose cushion preparation\nTiming: 15–20 min\nPrepare sucrose gradient for density gradient centrifugation.",
    "Note: Prepare the sucrose gradient while the cell sample is lysed on ice as described above.\nMark the half-full position with the marker casing tube provided by the gradient maker (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1284-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. 10%–45% sucrose gradient loading\n(A) Use the tube holder to mark the half-full point as shown by the black marker.\n(B) Add 10% sucrose buffer by a 1 mL pipette.\n(C) Add 45% sucrose buffer a long blunt needle.\nAdd 10% sucrose buffer first with 1 mL pipette until it reaches the half-full position (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: Touch the tip to the upper side wall of the tube and dispensing the buffer along the wall at a slow constant rate. Be careful to not generate bubbles that may interfere with following gradient making and polysome sedimentation.\nUse long blunt needle to reach the bottom of the ultracentrifuge tube and layer 45% sucrose buffer until the upper 10% sucrose buffer reaches the top of the tube (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nNote: This process should be slow and gentle at a constant rate to avoid disturbing the 10% sucrose buffer layer.\nLid the tube with the rate zonal cap provided by the gradient maker.\nNote: When lidding the tube, contact the sucrose buffer with one side of the cap at first, and then slowly drop the other side that has the air hole into the tube to avoid making bubbles. The air hole is used to vent the bubbles (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nPut the tube into the magnetic tube holder on the gradient maker.\nNote: Make sure the plate that the magnetic tube holder is attached on is level (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B).",
    "Run the sucrose gradient maker by selecting “10%–45%”. It takes about 1 min and 30 s to finish (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C). The sucrose gradient is ready to use immediately.\nPause point: Alternatively, the prepared sucrose cushion could be stored at −80°C for up to 6 months until use.\nNote: Slide the magnetic tube holder out slowly and gently upon the ending of gradient making. Take extra precautions when moving the tube to avoid disturbing the prepared sucrose gradient.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1284-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

In this example, 10%–45% gradient is used.\nPolysome sedimentation by ultracentrifugation\nTiming: 4 h\nUltracentrifugation to isolate 40S subunit, 60S subunit, 80S monosome, and polysome-bound RNA with different densities.\nLift up the cap of the tube and layer the cell lysate onto the sucrose cushion. The A260 and A280 of MV4-11 cell lysate is approximately 65 and 35 respectively as measured by the NanoDrop 2000. If applicable, load lysis buffer onto the sucrose cushion of blank sample group.\nNote: Use a 200 μL pipette to layer the cell sample onto the sucrose cushion. Touch the pipette tip to the upper side of the tube and dispense the cell lysate slowly and gently to avoid disturbing the sucrose gradient (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nPlace the sucrose cushion tube loaded with samples into the SW41 rotor bucket.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1284-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Loading cell lysate onto sucrose cushion",
    "(A) Use a 200 μL to layer the cell lysate without disturbing the sucrose gradient.\n(B) The cell lysate loaded onto the sucrose gradient as indicated by the red arrow.\nUse an analytical scale to balance the opposing rotor buckets.\nNote: Remember to put the cap together with the bucket on the analytical scale. If unbalanced, load lysis buffer onto the cushion to balance the buckets. It is acceptable that the weight differences between opposing buckets are under 0.003 g.\nOnce the buckets are balanced, screw the cap into the bucket and hook the buckets onto the rotor hanger. The buckets must be arranged symmetrically and all buckets, whether loaded or empty, must be hooked to rotor.\nNote: Screw the cap anticlockwise at first until you hear the click sound that indicates the cap fitted into the thread. Then screw the cap in the clockwise direction until there is metal-to metal contact.\nCarefully lift the rotor with steady hands and install it on the drive hub of the ultracentrifuge perpendicularly.\nOptional: You can check for the proper installation by manually turning the rotor clockwise and observe the speed reading on the screen.\nCentrifuge at 36,000 rpm (222,227 × g) for 3 h at 4°C with SW41 Ti rotor.\nCritical: Do not choose max deceleration for ultracentrifugation. Choose speed “5” instead for optimal polysome sedimentation.\nNote: Check for the proper functioning of the ultracentrifuge occasionally to avoid the occurrence of errors.\nPolysome fractionation\nCollect each ribosome-bound RNA fractions for subsequent analysis.\nTiming: 1 h\nTurn on the fractionation system 30 min ahead of the ending of ultracentrifugation.\nNote: Switch on pump, UV detector, fractionation collector, and computer. Press “SCAN” on the control panel first, otherwise the computer may not be successfully connected (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A and 6B).",
    "Note: Check whether the fractionation collector is at the initial position; if not, press “END” on the control panel of the fractionation station (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C).\nOpen the software Triax™ FlowCell on the computer and set the parameters for fractionation.\nNote: The parameters set for the fractionation station is shown in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7].\nFill the syringe attached to the fractionation station with DEPC-treated water to extensively rinse the system.\nPress “air” on the control panel to remove any residual water. Repeat the rinse and air operations for two more times.\nOptional: A text run with DEPC-treated water is recommended to check whether the system works properly.\nPrepare 2 mL tube for collecting. Place them into tube rack on the fractionation collector.\nNote: The tubes are placed into the rack to match the order of the sequentially collected fractions (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\nOnce the ultracentrifugation for polysome sedimentation ends, take out the rotor and place it onto the adapter.\nUse a screwdriver to remove the cap of the bucket, and take out the centrifuge tube with tweezers.\nNote: Take extra care to ensure not to disturb the gradient at this stage. Be careful to not make the bucket sway on the hanger when taking it out from the ultracentrifuge.\nPut the cap of the SW41 tube holder onto the centrifuge tube of cell sample (Figures 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]A–9C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1284-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

Load the sample tube with the tube holder for collection\n(A–C) Fit the cap of the tube holder onto the sample tube.\n(D–F) Install the loaded tube holder onto the fractionation station.\nPlace the capped centrifuge tube into the SW41 tube holder provided by the fractionation station. Gently screw the cap clockwise to secure the centrifuge tube (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]D).\nTransfer the loaded tube holder to let it slide into the fractionation station and turn it clockwise to be ready for collection (Figures 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]E and 9F).\nStart the run by clicking the “START SCAN” in the software program. This will start the collection of each fraction by a piston tip from top to bottom, and at the same time the UV absorbance at 260 nm is recorded to plot the tracing. Make sure that every drop of each fraction is collected into its corresponding 2 mL tube (Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3], 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5], and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]).\nNote: Do not turn on the light from the piston tip for a prolonged period of time. The heat generated from the light may cause RNA degradation in the sucrose gradient.\nNote: Press “Air” when the run ends to blow the residual drops out into the last tube for collection.\nTransfer the 2 mL tube on the ice and add equal volume RNAiso Plus solution immediately. Vigorously vortex each tube to mix thoroughly.",
    "Flash freeze each fraction with RNAiso Plus solution in liquid nitrogen and store them at −80°C until use.\nCaution: RNAiso Plus solution is toxic and harmful for the researcher and surrounding environment. Precautionary measures should be taken, including working in a fume hood, wearing disposable latex gloves, coat, and goggles.\nNote: Clearly mark the fraction number on the tube. Be careful not to spill RNAiso Plus solution which may erase the maker.\nRinse and air the fractionation system three times before another run. After all the runs finish, launch the last run with DEPC-treated water and extensively rinse the system to remove any residual sucrose.\nRNA extraction-day 2\nThis step can isolate RNA from sucrose buffer by RNAiso Plus solution.\nTiming: 4–6 h\nTake samples from −80°C and quickly thaw them at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nAdd 0.2 mL of chloroform per 1 mL of RNAiso Plus solution.\nVortex vigorously for 30 s to mix the chloroform thoroughly.\nNote: RNAiso Plus solution is caustic so that precautionary measures should be taken, including the wearing of eye protection. The tube cap should be tightly closed, and if necessary, use cap locks.\nKeep the samples at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 5 min.\nCentrifuge the samples at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.\nNote: The centrifuge should be pre-cooled to 4°C before use.\nNote: The samples are separated into three layers: the bottom layer is a red organic phase containing protein; the middle layer is a white semi-solid containing DNA; the top layer is a colorless aqueous phase containing RNA.\nTransfer the top layer into new RNase-free 1.5 mL tubes.\nCritical: Be careful not to touch the middle layer as it could lead to DNA contamination.",
    "Note: Two or more tubes should be used for each fraction to make sure that the volume of the aqueous phase is not over than 0.75 mL to allow the addition of isopropanol.\nAdd equal volume of ice-cold isopropanol and 1 μL GlycoBlue™ Coprecipitant. Mix thoroughly.\nCritical: It is recommended to add carrier because the RNA recovered from polysome fractions may not be easily visible. GlycoBlue™ Coprecipitant is glycogen linked with a blue dye. It facilitates nucleic acid precipitation and increases the size and visibility of the pellet without interfering subsequent analysis.\nKeep the mixture at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 10 min to precipitate.\nOptional: Keep the mixture at −20°C for at least 1 hour to increase RNA yield.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant carefully without touching the pellet.\nNote: Centrifuge shortly and remove the remaining isopropanol completely.\nAdd 1 mL ice-cold 75% ethanol to wash the RNA pellet.\nVortex briefly and centrifuge at 7,500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nNote: Do not disperse the pellet during vortexing.\nDiscard the supernatant carefully and add 1 mL ice-cold 100% ethanol to wash the RNA pellet.\nPause point: The RNA can be stored in 100% ethanol at −20°C for several months.\nVortex briefly and centrifuge at 7,500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nCentrifuge shortly and remove the remaining ethanol completely.\nAir dry the pellet for 5 min.\nDissolve the pellet with 10–30 μL RNase-free water.\nCritical: The final volume of the RNA solution should be identical for each fraction of polysome profiling.\nNote: The RNA solution should be kept on ice for immediate subsequent analyses to prevent degradation.",
    "Pause point: Alternative, the RNA solution could be stored at −80°C. RNA is generally stable at −80°C for up to a year. Use aliquots to avoid freeze-thaw cycles.\nMeasure the RNA concentrations by NanoDrop™ 2000 spectrophotometer (Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]).\nOptional: The DNase I treatment should be applied if a genomic DNA elimination reaction is not included in the subsequent reverse-transcription step.\nRNA detection by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR)\nRNA quantifications for each fraction to map the distribution of potentially translating lncRNAs in polysome profiles.\nTiming: 2–3 h (depending on number of samples)\nNote: RNAs are reversely transcribed to cDNA. The synthesized cDNA could serve as template for quantification of lncRNAs of interest by real-time PCR. The following reverse-transcription steps are performed using PrimeScript™ RT Reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser.\nAlternatives: Other kits or methods could also be used for reverse transcription.\nPrepare a genomic DNA elimination reaction mix as described in the following table.\nDispense equal volume of RNA samples from different fractions into each reaction.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1284_4.csv\nNote: All reaction components should be added on ice. A mix except for RNA samples is recommended to save time and should be prepared with at least one extra reaction.\nNote: To calculate the percent RNA of each fraction, the equal volume of RNA solution should be used for each fraction of polysome profiling.\nGently mix the reagent and quickly spin the samples to collect all liquid to the bottom of tubes.\nIncubate the samples at 42°C for 2 min and place them at 4°C until use.\nPrepare a reverse-transcription reaction mix shown below. Add 10 μL of mix to each reaction solution from last step.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1284_5.csv\nGently mix the reagent and quickly spin the samples to collect all liquid to the bottom of tubes.",
    "Incubate the samples at 37°C for 15 min, 85°C for 5 s and place them at 4°C until use.\nPause point: The cDNAs could be stored at −20°C for long term.\nThe cDNAs should be diluted at least two times with sterilized double-distilled water before use.\nPrepare the real-time PCR reaction mix except for cDNAs as described in the following table.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1284_6.csv\nNote: All reaction components should be added on ice.\nMix the reaction solution and quickly spin the samples.\nTransfer 8 μL of the mix to 96/384-well plate.\nNote: The 384-well plate is recommended to detect several lncRNAs for the same batch of fractions on the same plate.\nAdd 2 μL of the diluted cDNA to the corresponding wells.\nSeal the 96/384-well plate by an optical adhesive film.\nCritical: Make sure that the wells were completely sealed to avoid sample evaporation during PCR reaction.\nCentrifuge the plate at 1,500 × g for 2 min at 4°C to collect all liquid to the bottom of the plate and to eliminate bubbles.\nRun the real-time PCR reaction with the appropriate program. An example is shown in the following table.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1284_7.csv\nThe percent lncRNA of interest in each fraction is calculated by RT-qPCR data as described in quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis] section."
