    "This protocol and surgery video demonstration obtained the patient's informed consent before surgery, and also obtained approval from The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University.\n1. Preoperative preparation\nPerform laboratory tests, including blood routine examination, liver and renal function tests, tumor markers of the digestive system (alpha-fetoprotein, AFP; carcinoembryonic antigen, CEA), prothrombin time, international normalized ratio (INR), and indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min (ICG-R15), to evaluate the general condition of the patients.\nPerform imaging examinations, including a plain thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan, plain and contrast-enhanced upper abdominal CT scan, and liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to evaluate the tumor location, size, and presence of distant metastasis.\nCalculate the hepatic volume by CT volumetry calculation. If patients are considered for performing major hepatic resections (more than two hepatic segments), ensure that the future liver remnant (FLR)/total liver volume (TLV) ratio is ≥40%.\nPerform ancillary tests, including electrocardiography (ECG), cardiac ultrasound, and pulmonary function tests, to evaluate the patient's heart and lung condition.\nEnsure that the patients fully understand their medical condition and are calm enough to achieve good physical and mental preparation for the operation.\n2. Patient inclusion and exclusion criteria\nInclusion criteria\n\t\nInclude patients having both primary and secondary liver malignancies, as well as benign liver disease, and require segmentectomy.\nPerform surgery on both males and females between 15-85 years of age.\nEnsure that the patient is in good general condition and can tolerate both anesthesia and laparoscopic hepatectomy.\nEnsure that the preoperative liver function classification according to Child-Pugh is either A or B, the ICG-R15 is <10%, and the FLR/TLV ratio is ≥40%.\nExclusion criteria\n\t\nDo not include patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with portal and hepatic vein invasion.\nDo not perform surgery on patients with uncontrolled systemic infection.",
    "Do not perform this surgery if severe portal hypertension has been diagnosed by preoperative CT or endoscopy.\nEnsure that there has been no recent history of gastric or esophageal variceal bleeding, or refractory ascites.\nEnsure there is no diffuse intrahepatic metastasis or distant metastasis.\nDo not perform this surgery in cases where laparoscopic surgery is not feasible due to a history of severe abdominal adhesions resulting from multiple prior abdominal operations.\n3. Surgery\nNOTE: As the preoperative MRI revealed that most of the tumor was located in the S5, with a small portion located in the ventral segment of S8 and without any adjacent large blood vessels or bile ducts, S5 and partial S8 removal was planned to ensure a wide resection margin for complete tumor removal. Therefore, ligation of both S5 pedicles and the ventral branches of the S8 pedicles, as well as their branch veins draining into the middle hepatic vein, was planned. The resection was then performed by dissecting the ventral branch of the S8 segment and following along the hepatic pedicle of the S5.\nPreparation phase\n\t\nUnder general anesthesia, place the patient in a supine position, with the legs apart, head elevated, and feet lowered, forming a body angle of 30°.\nReduce the liquid infusion to 1 mL/kg/h (by the anesthetist) to keep the CVP below 5 cmH2O during the operation.\nDisinfect the abdominal skin with iodine and drape the patient to prepare a sterile field.\nEnsure that the primary surgeon stands on the right, the secondary surgeon stands on the left, and the assistant stands between the patient's legs.\nTrocar placement\n\t\nEstablish a carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum of 12-14 mmHg. Insert the trocars according to the location of the tumor.",
    "For this 54-year-old female patient, establish an observation port by inserting a 10 mm trocar 1 cm below the umbilicus.\nPosition two 12 mm trocars bilaterally at the lateral border of the rectus abdominis muscle, 2 cm superior to the umbilicus.\nPosition two 5 mm trocars bilaterally below the subcostal margin along the midclavicular line. The trocar layout is shown in Figure 2.\nExploration phase\n\t\nExplore the abdominal cavity and omentum to determine whether there are ascites, cirrhosis, intra-abdominal adhesions, or metastases.\nUse laparoscopic ultrasound to evaluate the tumor location, size, and its relationship with adjacent blood vessels or biliary structures, and confirm the preoperative MRI findings regarding the tumor.\nLocating the tumor\n\t\nLocate the tumor using laparoscopic ultrasound.\nUse an electric coagulation hook to demarcate the area of liver tissue that needs to be excised.\nEstablishing the extracorporeal Pringle maneuver\n\t\nLocate the first porta hepatis and open the omental bursa using a cordless ultrasonic dissector.\nPlace another 5 mm trocar (Pringle trocar) in the left hypochondrium along the axillary line. Put the cotton rope into the abdominal cavity through this port.\nUse laparoscopic forceps with an elongated head to horizontally pass the cotton rope through Winslow's foramen and encircle the hepatoduodenal ligament. Ensure that there are no adhesions behind the hepatoduodenal ligament, so that the forceps and cotton rope can pass horizontally without resistance, avoiding injury to the inferior vena cava and first porta hepatis.\nPull both ends of the cotton rope through the Pringle trocar using laparoscopic forceps after encircling the hepatoduodenal ligament, and then remove the Pringle trocar.",
    "Pass the end of the cotton rope through a plastic tube, known as a Lumir device, and insert it up to the level of the hepatic pedicle through the opening where the Pringle trocar was removed. The extracorporeal Pringle maneuver is now ready for application.\nInsert the Lumir device into the cavity to tighten the cotton rope and occlude hepatic inflow, then secure it with a vascular clamp (Figure 2).\nLiver parenchyma dissection phase\n\t\nLimit the clamping time to 15 min, followed by a 5 min declamping period during the operation.\nEnsure that the secondary surgeon opens the liver capsule along the marked border using an ultrasonic dissector, while the primary surgeon smashes the hepatic parenchyma using a laparoscopic CUSA in an archeological way. Directly cauterize each of the encountered small blood vessels and bile ducts with an ultrasonic dissector, while dividing the large ones after being clamped by Hem-o-lok.\nDissect the dorsal and ventral branches of the S8 segment within the middle hepatic vein. Clamp and ligate the ventral branch using an Endo-GIA stapler, while preserving the dorsal branch and dorsal segment of the S8.\nDissect the hepatic vein of the S5 segment and divide it after being clamped by Hem-o-lok.\nDissect the hepatic pedicle of the S5 segment and cut it with the Endo-GIA stapler. At this point, the planned resection of the liver segments has been successfully completed.\nSurgical end stage\n\t\nLoosen the cotton rope, cauterize the surgical wound to stop bleeding. Rinse the operation area, drain thoroughly, and cut the cotton rope to remove the Lumir device.\nCover the operation area with a layer of absorbable hemostat.\nInsert a closed-suction drain.\nClose the abdomen layer by layer.\n4. Postoperative follow-up",
    "Adopt the following management to the patients after returning to the general ward: monitoring of vital signs, intravenous nutrition, rapid recovery of internal organ functions, and prevention of infection and deep venous thrombosis.\nProvide a full-fluid diet and gradually transition to a regular diet over the next few days if the patients have no significant discomfort. Keep the rest of the treatments unchanged for the first 3 days.\nPerform lab examination of the whole blood cells, liver and kidney function, electrolyte levels, and blood coagulation function. Additionally, perform early thoracic and abdominal ultrasounds to check for hydrothorax and ascites.\nPerform a plain upper abdominal CT scan to confirm the absence of residual tumor, bleeding, and bile leakage. Then, remove the drain once the drainage fluid is minimal and clear, which is typically 5-6 days post-operation.\nPatients are typically discharged from the hospital 1 week after surgery and return to the outpatient clinic 1 month later. If necessary, surgeons may take appropriate measures and extend the course of treatment according to the patient's condition.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
