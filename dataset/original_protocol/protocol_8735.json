    "1. Handling of the Peptide\nDesign and ordering of the peptide\n\t\nChoose the desired sequence of the peptide, and add a tag, such as myc epitope (EQKLISEED) at its either N- or C-terminus.\nCheck the predicted solubility of the peptide in water, using peptide solubility calculator http://pepcalc.com/peptide-solubility-calculator.php. If the solubility is low, try to add another water-soluble tag to change the charge balance.\n\t\tNOTE: We used the peptide corresponding to the first luminal loop (fll) of GLUT4 tagged with the myc epitope (bold font) at the N terminus (Myc-fll-GLUT4): EQKLISEEDLNAPQKVIEQSYNATWLGRQGPGGPSSIPPGTLTTLWA that has \"good\" predicted solubility in water.\nOrder the custom peptide with at least 75% purity which is sufficient for the assay, and ask the provider for solubility test. Separate the order into at least two aliquots in case of unforeseen problems with dissolving the peptide.\n\t\tNOTE: Myc-fll-GLUT4 was ordered in two aliquots. Its reported solubility in ultrapure water is ≤10 mg/mL.\nDissolving the peptide\n\tNote: Ultrapure water is the best solvent. If the peptide does not appear to be water soluble, refer to http://www.genscript.com/peptide_solubility_and_stablity.html for instructions.\n\t\nPrepare 100x working solution of the peptide in ultrapure water or in buffer of choice, with the concentration of 100 μg/mL.\nSeparate the solution into 50 - 100 µL aliquots, and store them at -20 °C.\n2. Handling of Cells\nCell culture\n\t\nUse Wild type (WT) cells as a negative control, and cells expressing the target protein tagged with six histidines (HisP).\n\t\tNOTE: We used 3T3 L1 pre-adipocytes stably transfected with Sortilin-myc/His5.\nGrow the cells in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) high Sugar, supplemented with 10% calf bovine serum, glutamine (2 mM) and penicillin/streptomycin (5 μg/mL) at 37 °C in 10% CO2.",
    "Sit four 10 cm dishes of cells, transfect two of them with HisP and transfect the other two with control plasmid (WT). 48 h after transfection, cells should reach 80 - 90% confluency.\nPreparation of the Cell Lysates\n\t\nPrepare lysis buffer (10 mM Hepes, 30 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 10 mM Imidazole, 0.5% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor cocktail without EDTA for the isolation of His-tagged proteins, pH 7.4) and keep it at 4 °C:\nWash cells three times with 10 mL of 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C.\nPut the dishes on ice and add 500 µL of lysis buffer to each dish. Harvest the cell lysates using a cell scraper.\nPlace the cell lysate from each dish into a different 1.5 mL tube. Label the tubes as WT-pH6, WT-pH8, HisP-pH6, HisP-pH8.\nPass the cell lysates through a syringe with a 26G needle five times up and down, to complete lysis.\nCentrifuge the cell lysates at 16,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\nTransfer the supernatants to new identically labeled tubes.\nAnalyze protein concentration using the BCA Protein Assay Kit or other kit.\nUsing lysis buffer, equalize protein concentration of all four lysates.\nSeparate a small (ca. 20 µL) aliquot of each lysate and keep it at -20 °C for possible control experiments and/or trouble shooting.\n3. Binding of His-tagged Proteins to the HisPur Cobalt Beads\nUse commercially available wash buffer or prepare one (50 mM Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 8) and keep it at 4 °C.\nPrepare wash buffer with pH 6 by tittering wash buffer pH 8 with HCl. Keep it at 4 °C.\nGently swirl the bottle of the cobalt beads to make homogenous suspension.",
    "Dispense 40 µL of the Cobalt beads suspension into four 1.5 mL tubes marked as above (step 2.2.4).\nAdd 1 mL of lysis buffer to each tube, and centrifuge the tubes at 1000 x g for 5 s. Aspirate the supernatant, and add 40 μL of lysis buffer to settled beads.\nAdd the cell lysates to corresponding tubes.\nIncubate the tubes for 90 min at 4 °C on a tube rotator at 20 rpm.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 1000 x g for 5 s and collect the supernatant. Keep the supernatant at 4 °C.\nAdd 500 µL of either pH 8 or pH 6 wash buffer to corresponding tubes and re-suspend the beads gently.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 1000 x g for 5 s and discard the supernatants.\nRepeat steps 3.9 and 3.10 for four times.\n4. Binding of the Peptide to the His-tagged Protein Immobilized on the Beads\nUsing 100x working solution of the peptide (step 1.2.1), prepare 1x working solutions in either pH 6 or pH 8 wash buffer (two 100 µL aliquots for each, 1 µg/mL).\nAdd 100 μL of 1x peptide solution to the washed beads with the corresponding pH.\nIncubate the beads for 30 min at 4 °C on a tube rotator at 20 rpm.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 1,000 x g for 5 s, collect the supernatant and keep it at -20 °C.\nRepeat steps 3.9 and 3.10 for four times.\n\tNOTE: In order to decrease possible background, the following steps could replace steps 4.4 & 4.5.\nTake four micro columns with 30 μm pores, label them as in step 2.2.4, and place the columns in collection tubes.",
    "After completion of step 4.3, transfer the incubation mixture into the columns, allow the solution to pass through by gravity. Keep the flow through at -20 °C.\nPass 500 µL of wash buffer with pH 6 or pH 8 through corresponding columns by gravity. Discard the flow through.\nRepeat step 4.8 four times.\nAfter the last wash, centrifuge the columns at 1,000 x g for 15 s.\n5. Elution from Cobalt Beads\nUse commercial Tricine sample buffer (200 mM Tris-HCl, 40% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.04% Coomassie Blue, pH 6.8) and add β-mercaptoethanol to the final concentration of 2%.\nAdd 40 µL of Tricine sample buffer (with β-mercaptoethanol) to the washed beads and vortex the sample.\nHeat the samples for 10 min at 100 °C, vortex the samples again, and centrifuge the tubes at 1,000 x g for 5 s.\n\tNOTE: In order to decrease possible nonspecific binding in the elution, the following steps could replace steps 5.1 - 5.3.\nAdd 40 μL of Elution Imidazole Buffer (50 mM Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 0.25 M imidazole) to the washed beads, vortex and incubate the tubes at room temperature for 20 min.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 3,000 x g for 30 s, collect the supernatant (eluted samples) and transfer it to new labeled tubes.\nAdd 40 μL of Tricine sample buffer to each tube, heat the samples for 10 min at 100 °C, vortex and centrifuge the tubes at 1,000 x g for 5 s.\n\tNOTE: If micro columns are used, add the elution buffer to the washed beads, incubate for 20 min and collect the elution by centrifugation at 8,000 x g for 2 min.\n\tNOTE: Samples can be kept at -20 °C till electrophoresis is performed.\n6. Electrophoresis and Western blotting",
    "Note: The samples are ready for the separation by SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blotting. Follow protocol of gel electrophoresis (https://www.jove.com/science-education/5065/the-western-blot) with the following modifications.\nUse commercially available 10 - 20% Tricine gradient gels.\nOn the gel, load 20 µL of the eluted samples and 20 µL of lysates (step 2.2.10). For trouble shooting, it is recommended to load 20 µL of unbound material (step 3.8) and 10 ng of the peptide; before loading, add equal amount of Tricine sample buffer to these samples.\nCarry out electrophoresis in commercial Tris/Tricine/SDS running buffer (100 mM Tris, 100 mM Tricine, and 0.1% SDS, pH 8.3).\nTransfer the material from the gel onto a 0.45 µm nitrocellulose membrane using transfer buffer (25 mM Tris base, 192 mM glycine, pH 8.4) supplemented with 20% methanol.\nBlock the membrane with 3% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. Using pre-stained molecular weight markers as guides, cut the membrane horizontally, blot the top part with an antibody against HisP, and blot the bottom part with an antibody against the myc epitope to identify the myc-tagged peptide.\n\tNOTE: In our particular case, cutting of the membrane is not required since both HisP and Myc-fll-GLUT4 can be detected with an anti-myc antibody.\n7. Analysis of Results\nQuantify the intensity of all Western blot signals using an Image Station or ImageJ program.\nNormalize the signal from the myc-tagged peptide against the signal from HisP at both pH values.\nSubscription Required.
