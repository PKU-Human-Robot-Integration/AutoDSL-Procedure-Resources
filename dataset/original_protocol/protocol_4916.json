    "Bone marrow cells were isolated by crushing the femurs and tibias of 7-week-old BALB/c WT mice. Red blood cells were lysed with ACK lysing buffer, and the cells were differentiated into dendritic cells for eight days using RPMI culture medium – 400,000 cells per 2 ml per 6-well. On day three, 2 ml of fresh culture medium was added, and on day six the medium was replaced with fresh culture medium.Cell death induction in target, CT26 DD_RIPK3, cellsSeed 1 x 106 CT26 DD_RIPK3 cells in 10 ml DMEM culture medium per 10 cm Petri dish.Wait 5 h for the cells to attach.Wash the Petri dishes with serum-free DMEM.Add 10 ml of serum-free DMEM + 1 µM CellTrackerTM green CMFDA to each plate.Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C.Remove the medium, and wash the plate with RPMI culture medium.Add 10 ml RPMI culture medium to each Petri dish, incubate for 2 h at 37 °C.Induce cell death by adding 1 µg/ml doxycycline + 10 nM B/B homodimerizer.Incubate for another 18 h at 37 °C.Co-culture with BMDCsCollect the BMDCs and CT26 target cells into separate 15 ml Falcon® tubesLive CT26 cells are collected by adding EDTA (2 ml per 75 cm2), incubating at 37 °C for 2 min, then collecting in RPMI culture medium (8 ml per 75 cm2). Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min.Dead CT26 cells are collected by pipetting only the cells in solution. Centrifuge at 400 x g for 5 min.Count the cells and resuspend them in RPMI culture medium.Seed the cells in 6-well suspension plates.Seed 400,000 BMDCs + 400,000 CT26 cells (ratio 1:1) in a total volume of 4 ml per well.Incubate for 2 h at 37 °C.",

See Figure 1 and Table 1 for the gating strategy and compensation matrix used in FlowJo.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161031/20161031232735_2214.jpgFigure 1. Gating strategy used for the analysis in FlowJo. Figure 1 shows the gating strategy used, when analyzing the results in FlowJo. Using the forward and side scatter area (FSC-A vs. SSC-A), the debris is excluded from the analysis.",
    "In the following two steps, doublet cells are removed, by drawing a gate around the single cells, which roughly gather along the diagonal of FSC-A vs. FSC-H, followed by SSC-A vs. SSC-H. A Live/Dead staining, in this case SYTOX® blue, is used to eliminate dead cells. In the final panel, the live, SYTOX® blue-negative, cells can now be analyzed for phagocytosis by plotting Cell Tracker Green CMFDA (target cells) vs. CD11c-APC (BMDCs).Table 1.
