    "NOTE: All in vivo experiments were conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources. Experiments were approved by the Animal Experimentation Committee of the Medicine Faculty of the Utrecht University, the Netherlands.\n1. Formulation of the Hydrogel\nTo prepare 1 ml of the 10 wt% gel, dissolve 100 mg of the UPy-hydrogelator in a vial in 900 μl PBS pH 11.7 by stirring at 70 °C for 1 hr using a magnetic stirrer. Afterwards cool the viscous solution down to room temperature. The solution should now have a pH of approximately 9.0. This solution can be stored for several days.\nPipette the appropriate amount of drug or biomolecule that is dissolved in neutral PBS into the viscous solution and stir for 10 min to reach a uniform distribution. If the solution becomes too viscous, shortly warm it with hot water.\nPlace the solution for 1 hr under an UV-lamp to sterilize.\n2. Analysis of Hydrogel\nRheological assessment of the solution\n\t\nBefore loading the gel, mount the 25 mm plate-plate geometry in the rheometer, set the temperature to 20 °C and load the plate with water to prevent evaporation of the gel during measurement.\nPipette 300 μl of the solution onto a 25 mm plate-plate geometry on a rheometer maintained at 20 °C and lower the plates to obtain a 0.5 mm gap distance.\nRecord shear viscosity as function of shear stress from 0.1 to 500 Pa with 10 points per decade.\nRheological assessment of the gel\n\t\nPipette 300 μl of the solution onto the plate and pipette a total of 4.2 μl of 1 M HCl at different places on the solution to induce the gel formation.",
    "Lower the plates to a gap distance of 0.5 mm and let the gel cure for approximately 30 min. During this curing process, measure the storage and loss moduli at low frequency and strain, for example respectively 1 rad/sec and 0.5%.\nAfter the gel has cured (after approximately 30 min), record storage and loss moduli as function of the frequency (0.1-100 rad/sec) and subsequently as function of the strain (0.1-1,000%).\n3. Erosion and Release Experiments\nTransfer 100 µl of the viscous solution containing the drug or biomolecule into a poly(ethylene terephthalate) hanging cell culture insert for 24-wells plate with pore size 8.0 µm. To prevent leakage of the polymer solution while in the liquid phase, cover the bottom of the inserts with Parafilm (Figure 2A).\nImmediately afterwards pipette 1.4 µl of 1 M HCl on top of the viscous solution to reduce the pH to approximately 7.0-7.2 and let the gel cure inside the insert for about 30 min.\nRemove the Parafilm from the inserts, place the insert in a 24-well plate and fill the well with 800 µl PBS pH 7.4. Incubate the plate at 37 °C with slow rocking or shaking movement. To prevent evaporation of the solvent, fill remaining empty wells with PBS and seal the 24-well plate with Parafilm (Figure 2B).\nPeriodically refresh the PBS and analyze the removed PBS for released UPy erosion product or drug/biomolecule.\n\t\nQuantify UPy erosion products or pirfenidone by measuring UV absorbance at 265 nm or 320 nm respectively. For fluorescent protein mRuby2 measure fluorescence emission at 587 nm after excitation at 559 nm.\nTranslate measured absorption/emission values to concentrations via predetermined calibration curves.",
    "Prepare calibration curves dissolving a series of known concentrations of the analyte in buffer and measure the UV absorbance or fluorescent emission of these samples. Interpolate the data using a linear function to determine the concentration of the unknown samples. For non-fluorescent proteins use ELISA detection6.\n4. Local Injection via a Catheter\nInduction of myocardial infarction\n\t\nAfter 12 hr of fasting, excluding water, sedate the pig in its stable by injecting midazolam 0.4 mg/kg, ketamine 10 mg/kg and atropine 0.014 mg/kg intramuscularly.\nAdministrate sodium thiopental 5 mg/kg intravenously to induce anesthesia and intubate the pig with an endotracheal tube. Perform balloon-ventilation at a rate of 12/min if needed while transporting the animal to the operating theater.\nOn arrival at the operation theater immediately start mechanical positive pressure ventilation with FiO2 0.50, 10 ml/kg tidal volume, and a frequency of 12/min under continuous capnography. Use vet ointment on the eyes to prevent dryness.\nStart balanced anesthesia by continuous intravenous infusion of midazolam 0.5 mg/kg/hr, sufentanil 2.5 µg/kg/hr and pancuronium bromide 0.1 mg/kg/hr. To ensure proper anesthesia continuously monitor ECG, arterial blood pressure, temperature and capnography.\nIntravenously infuse 4.3 mg/kg amiodarone and place the intracardiac defibrillation catheter in the right ventricle using the venous sheeth18.\nOcclude the left anterior descending artery (LAD) distal to the second diagonal branch by intracoronary balloon occlusion, for 90 min, in accordance to previously described protocol18.\nElectromechanical mapping",
    "At four weeks after myocardial infarction, plan the mapping procedure. Prepare the system (Figure 4) in the cathlab for 3D electromechanical mapping (EMM) of the left ventricle. With this system viable, hibernating and infarcted myocardium can be identified without fluoroscopic guidance. To construct such an EM-map acquire a series of points at multiple locations on the LV endocardial surface by using an ultralow magnetic-field energy source and a sensor-tipped catheter19,20.\nAnesthetize the pig, following protocol steps 4.1.1-4.1.4.\nPlace the external reference patch on the pig’s back.\nSecure vascular access (femoral artery) according to protocol18.\nAfter obtaining a biplane left ventricular angiogram in the 25° right anterior oblique (RAO) and 40° left anterior oblique (LA) view to estimate left ventricular size, give 75 U/kg of heparin.\nAdvance an 8 French-mapping (D or F curve) catheter under fluoroscopic guidance to the descending aorta, aortic arch and across the aortic valve into the left ventricle (LV).\nOrientate the tip of the catheter to the apex of the LV to acquire the first data, followed by outflow tract, lateral and posterior points to form a 3D silhouette, defining the borders of the ventricle.\nObtain subsequent points until all endocardial segments have been sampled by dragging the mapping catheter over the endocardium and sequentially acquiring the location of the tip while in contact with the endocardium21,22.\nDefine the target area, that is where electrical activity is (near) normal and mechanical movement impaired, so-called hibernating myocardium (Figure 6).\nIntramyocardial injection\n\t\nReplace the mapping catheter by the intramyocardial injection catheter which is composed of a 27-gauge needle and a core lumen inside an 8 French catheter (Figure 5A and B). To deliver specific amounts, load a volume-graded syringe with approximately 2 ml of the hydrogel solution and place it into a syringe pump.",
    "Adjust the needle extension at 0° and 90° flex and place 0.1 ml of the hydrogel solution to fill the needle dead space. Then, place the injection catheter tip across the aortic valve and into the target area.\nMeet the following criteria for an injection position inside the target area determined in 4.2.9: (1) perpendicular position of the catheter to the LV wall; (2) excellent loop stability (<4 mm) as calculated by the EMM-system; and (3) underlying voltage >6.9 mV21.\n\t\t\nAdvance the needle into the myocardium, (4) confirmed by a premature ventricular contraction of the LV, and inject 0.1-0.3 ml of the hydrogel in a bolus at a constant rate of approximately 0.4-0.5 ml/min using the syringe pump. Repeat this at 6-10 different positions as diffuse as possible. The natural pH of the tissue will neutralize the solution after injection, upon which the hydrogel is formed.\nSacrifice\n\t\nPost-procedure, humanely sacrifice the animal by exsanguination. Cut the inferior caval vein and remove blood with a suction device. Induce ventricular fibrillation by placing a 9 V battery on the apex."
