    "Freshly prepare liver digestion solution by pipetting 4.4 ml Krebs-Ringer-Buffer (KRB), 25 µl DNase I solution, 500 µl Collagenase IV solution, 20 µl 0.5 M CaCl2 and 50 µl 0.2 M MgCl2 into a gentleMACS C tube. Warm up by keeping at 37 °C for 30 min. This solution ensures effective liver tissue digestion while proteolytic degradation of immune cell surface receptors is limited.    Sacrifice mouse by cervical dislocation and remove the liver from a mouse aseptically under the sterile bench and transfer the organ into a well of a sterile 6 well plate filled with 5 ml KRB buffer. If co-isolation of some ILC2 cells potentially present in the vasculature should be avoided include liver perfusion e.g. via the portal vein system using standard techniques described elsewhere.    Rinse the liver with KRB buffer and transfer it into the C tube containing pre-warmed liver digesting solution.   Dissociate the tissue by applying the C tube into the gentleMACS Dissociator and running the program m_liver-01.02.  Note: One mouse liver can be proceeded per C tube, the program can be run 2-3 times till the tissue is fully homogenized.   Attach the C tube containing the homogenized tissue to the MACSmix Tube Rotator and incubate the sample at 37 °C for 30 min under continuous rotation.   Apply the tube to the gentleMACS Dissociator again and run the program m_liver-02.02.   Prepare a 50 ml tube and a 100 µm cell strainer by rinsing them with PEB buffer.   Apply the homogenized tissue from C tube on the strainer on the 50 ml tube and wash the strainer with additional 10 ml PEB buffer.   Discard the cell strainer and add further 20 ml PEB buffer to the tube. Centrifuge the sample at 20 x g at 4 °C for 4 min.",
    "This step removes unwanted hepatocytes from the liver cell suspension.   Carefully remove the supernatant from the sample and transfer it into a new 50 ml tube.   Wash the cells by adding 30 ml PEB buffer and centrifugation at 300 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.   Carefully discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml of PEB buffer.    Apply 10 ml of ACK buffer on the suspension to remove red blood cells. Incubate the    sample at room temperature for 5 min.   Wash the sample two times by adding 30 ml PEB buffer and centrifugation at 300 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.   Fill 15 ml tube with 5 ml of 80% Biocoll separation solution.   Resuspend isolated cells in 10 ml 30% Biocoll separation solution and overlay slowly to the 80% Biocoll solution. Centrifuge the cells at room temperature with 1,400 x g for 20 min without breaks.   Collect the target cells by carefully pipetting up the interface fraction between the gradients into a new 50 ml tube.   Wash with 30 ml PEB buffer and centrifuge at 300 x g for 15 min.   Count the cells by using a hemocytometer and distribute to FACS tube for staining.   Prior to staining block unspecific bindings by incubating cells with 1 µl/107 cells of Fc-Block at 4 °C for 5 min.   Proceed immediately to staining using the following antibodies using the manufacturer’s recommended concentrations: anti-Sca-1, anti-ICOS, anti-CD25, biotinylated lineage antibodies. Add 0.015 µg/106 cells of Brilliant Violet 421 Streptavidin.    Incubate the tube at room temperature for 20 min.    Wash the cells by adding 2 ml FACS buffer and centrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min.   Proceed to FACS sorting. Gate and sort ILC2 as lineage negative, Sca-1+, ICOS+, KLRG1+ cells (see gating strategy in Figure 1).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.",
