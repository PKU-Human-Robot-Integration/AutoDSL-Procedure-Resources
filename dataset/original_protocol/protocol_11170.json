    "Informed written consent was obtained from all patients (from the Haukeland Hospital, Bergen, Norway, according to local ethics committee regulations). This protocol follows the guidelines of Bordeaux University human and animal research ethics committees. Pregnant rats were housed and treated in the animal facility of Bordeaux University. Euthanasia of an E18-timed pregnant rat was performed by using CO2. All animal procedures have been done according to the institutional guidelines and approved by the local ethics committee. All commercial products are referenced in the Table of Materials.\n1. Preparation of the patterned slides\nSubstrate preparation for micropatterning\n\t\nTreat 18 mm circular glass coverslips by air/plasma activation for 5 min. Place the coverslips in a closed chamber with 100 µL of (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane in a desiccator for 1 h.\nIncubate with 100 mg/mL of poly (ethylene glycol)-succinimidyl valerate (molecular weight 5,000 (Peg-SVA)) in 10 mM carbonate buffer, pH > 8, for 1 h. Rinse extensively with ultrapure water, and dry under a chemical hood.\n\t\t​NOTE: At this stage, the sample can be stored at 4 °C in the dark for further use.\nAdd the photoinitiator, 4-benzoylbenzyl-trimethylammonium chloride (PLPP), at 14.7 mg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\n\t\tNOTE: A concentrated form of PLPP, a PLPP gel, can also be used. It results in a shorter ultraviolet (UV) illumination time required to degrade the PEG brush (100 mJ/mm2).\nPhotoinitiator gel deposition\n\t\nPrepare a mixture of 3 µL of PLPP gel and 50 µL of absolute ethanol to deposit in the center of the slide. Place the sample under a chemical hood until complete evaporation of the absolute ethanol.\n\t\tNOTE: At this stage, the sample can be stored at 4 °C in the dark for further use.\nGlass slide micropatterning",
    "Mount the coverslip in a Ludin chamber, and place it on the motorized stage of a microscope equipped with an auto-focus system.\nLoad images corresponding to the envisioned micropatterns into the software. Apply these parameters: replication 4 x 4 times, spacing of 200 µm, UV dose of 1,000 mJ/mm2. After the automatic UV-illumination sequence, rinse the PLPP away with multiple PBS washes.\n\t\tNOTE: If PLPP gel was used, remove it by extensive washes with deionized water, dry in a stream of N2, and store at 4 °C.\nIncubate with laminin (50 µg/mL in PBS) for 30 min. Wash extensively with PBS.\n\t\t​NOTE: A fluorescent solution of purified green fluorescent protein (GFP, 10 µg/mL in PBS) can be mixed with laminin to visualize the micropatterns by fluorescence microscopy.\n2. Preparation of neurons and GBM cells for co-culture\nCulture of embryonic rat hippocampal neurons\n\t\nDissect the hippocampus of embryonic (E18) rats, and transfer the tissue into a Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS)/1 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)/penicillin-streptomycin solution in a 15 mL tube. Remove excess solution without drying the hippocampus.\nAdd 5 mL of trypsin-ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) supplemented with penicillin (10,000 units/mL)/streptomycin (10,000 µg/mL) and 1 mM HEPES, and incubate for 15 min at 37 °C. Wash 2x with the HBSS/HEPES/penicillin-streptomycin solution, and let the tissue remain in this solution for 2-3 min.\nDissociate the tissue using two flame-polished Pasteur pipettes, by pipetting up and down 10x with each tissue, taking care to minimize foaming. Count the cells, and evaluate the viability of the cell suspension. Plate the neurons on micropatterned coverslips as indicated below.\n\t\tNOTE: Cell viability rate is 85-90% after extraction.\nCell culture for neurons on micropatterned coverslips\n\t\nRehydrate micropatterned glass slides with PBS, and incubate complete neuronal cell culture medium.",
    "Seed the hippocampal neurons obtained from E18 Sprague-Dawley rats directly over the micropatterned glass coverslip at a density of 50,000 cells per cm2 in neurobasal medium (NBM) enriched with 3% horse serum. Place the micropatterned neurons in the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 48 h.\n\t\tNOTE: After ~6 h, primary hippocampal neurons can be seen adhering to the laminin micropatterns.\nCo-culture of human GBM stem-like cells on neurons\n\t​NOTE: For this study, membrane GFP-positive and nuclear-tomato patient-derived GBM cells were grown according to previous published protocols10.\n\t\nAs the spheroid-shaped cells grow in suspension, centrifuge the suspension for 5 min at 200 × g. Wash the spheroids with 5 mL of PBS, and incubate the cells with 0.5 mL of the cell dissociation reagent (see the Table of Materials) for 5 min at 37 °C.\nAdd 4.5 mL of complete NBM (complemented with B27 supplement, heparin, fibroblast growth factor 2, penicillin, and streptomycin, as described previously8), and count the cells using an automatic counting technique.\nSeed 1,000 GBM cells over the micropatterned neuronal culture in NBM enriched with 3% horse serum. Incubate the plate at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity.\n3. Live cell imaging\nImmediately after GBM cell seeding, place the sample on the stage of an inverted microscope equipped with a thermostat chamber. Perform live-cell imaging on the microscope equipped with a motorized stage for recording multiple positions by using a multidimensional acquisitions toolbox in the software. Acquire brightfield and epifluorescence GFP/Tomato images every 5 minutes over 12 h with a 20x objective in a temperature (37 °C) and gas-controlled (5% CO2) environment.\n4. Image analysis",
    "NOTE: Using Fiji, two-dimensional (2D) image stack were semi-automatically preprocessed or processed by using a homemade and user-friendly tool (available at this address: https://github.com/Guyon-J/Coculture_Gliomas-Neurons/blob/main/README.md), which is written in IJ1 macro language (Figure 2A). The automated workflow and procedures are summarized in Figure 2B.\nNeuronal network analysis (Figure 2Bi)\n\t\nSelect one image of the stack. Right-click on the Network tool to open the corresponding Options dialog box and adjust the settings (e.g., Threshold = Triangle, Li, Huang…, Gaussian Blur, and Median filters = 1, 2, 3…) to produce a precise segmentation of images. Then, click on OK.\nLeft-click on the Network tool to automatically activate the following procedure.\n\t\t\nDuplicate the selected image, and split it into three color channels (Red-Grey-Green).\nSelect the grey channel (brightfield), and perform contrast stretch enhancement (CSE) to enhance the separation between different areas. Use the Sobel edge detector (SED) to perform the 2D signal processing convolution operation already grouped under the Find Edge command.\nFor double-filtering (F), apply a Gaussian blur and median filter to reduce noise and smooth the object signal. Convert to Mask (CM) by executing adapted threshold algorithms to obtain a binary picture (BIN-grey) with black pixels (cell area) and white pixels (background). Skeletonize (Sk) the cell area into a simple network (NET), and filter particles (EP) in a NET image by removing small, non-networked particles.\nFor red and green channels (nucleus and membrane), perform double-filtering, convert to Mask using the adapted thresholding method, and allow BIN-green to determine cell morphology with the Analyze Particles command.\nMerge all channels using their region of interest (ROI) with the OR (combine) operator, and readjust their initial color into a simple RGB image.\nSingle-cell motility analysis (Figure 2Bii)",
    "Right-click on the Single Cell Tracking tool to open the corresponding Options dialog box, and adjust the settings (e.g., Trail type = Nucleus or Membrane, Threshold = Triangle, Li, Huang…, Z projection = Max intensity, Sum Slices…, Gaussian Blur and Median filters = 1, 2, 3…) to produce a precise segmentation of images. Then, click on OK.\nLeft-click on the Single Cell Tracking tool to automatically activate the following procedure.\n\t\t\nRemove the grey channel. Apply a Z projection on the stack, which will generate an image corresponding to an image stack according to the time (T-stack). Double-filter and convert to Mask the trails left by cells. Remove small particles to the BIN-red/green image.\nBy using ROI, select each contour of the cell trace, and check the box Skip edge detection in the Options dialog box to skip this preprocessing step for subsequent steps.\nIsolate the red channel (Trail type = Nucleus) on the original stack. Select one ROI and remove the outer area. Double-filter all images and convert to Mask (BIN-red). Determine the centroid X/Y position of each binarized nucleus.\nUsing an already published macro for spreadsheet software13, calculate the mean square displacement, directionality ratio, and average speed for this cell.\nMultiple-cell tracking analysis (Figure 2Biii)\n\t\nRight-click on the Tracking tool to open the corresponding Options dialog box and adjust the settings (e.g., Threshold = Triangle, Li, Huang…, Gaussian Blur and Median filters = 1, 2, 3…) to produce a precise segmentation of images. Then, click on OK.\nLeft-click on the Tracking tool to automatically activate the following procedure.\n\t\t\nRemove the grey channel.\nSplit the red and green channels, double-filter, and convert to Mask.\nMerge the channels using Image Calculator… command with the AND operator, leaving only the nucleus signal found in the membranes.",
    "NOTE: Several plugins in Fiji can be used to determine the X/Y position of several cells in this binary preprocessed image at the same time (see the Table of Materials).\nUsing a previously described macro13, calculate the trajectory plot, mean square displacement, directionality ratio, and average speed for these cells.\nSpheroid migration on the neural mat (Figure 2Biv)\n\t\nRight-click on the Migration tool to open the corresponding Options dialog box and adjust the settings (e.g., Threshold = Triangle, Li, Huang…, Gaussian Blur and Median filters = 1, 2, 3…) to produce a precise segmentation of images. Then, click on OK.\nLeft-click on the Migration tool to automatically activate the following procedure.\n\t\t\nRemove the red channel.\nSplit the green and grey channels.\nFor the grey channel, draw manually the contour of the neuronal mat, and measure its area.\nFor the green channel, double-filter the stack and convert to Mask. Remove the area outside the pattern (BIN), and determine the binarized cell area for each image.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: Parameters described above are calibrated by changing their values by left-clicking on the icon of interest. This processing can be done manually. However, for a large number of images (approximately a hundred per acquisitions), channels (generally 3 channels), and processing steps, an automated or semi-automated tool would be preferable.\nSubscription Required.
