    "Safe handling of radioactive materialsPlease note that this procedure utilizes radioactive [35S]-Methionine. All users must be appropriately trained to handle and dispose of radioactive materials. A dedicated laboratory space should also be demarcated for containment. Safe handling and disposal of all tips, tubes, and reagents are important for minimizing the risks of exposure contamination.Preparation of SUMO enzymes from E. coliPrior to performing the in vitro SUMO modification assay, recombinant SUMO and pathway enzymes must first be expressed in E. coli and purified. Methods for protein expression and purification have been described elsewhere (Yang et al., 2018).In vitro transcription/translation of protein of interestRemove a tube of rabbit reticulocyte from the kit stored at -80 °C and thaw on ice.For each substrate, add 20 μl of rabbit reticulocyte to an Eppendorf tube on ice.Return any remaining rabbit reticulocyte back to -80 °C for future use; avoid freeze/thaw cycles.Add 2 μl of [35S]-Methionine to each tube, keep on ice.Add 500 ng of plasmid DNA for substrate protein of interest to each reaction, keep on ice.Incubate in a 30 °C water bath for at least 1 h (60-90 min).In vitro SUMO modificationEach reaction will have 28 μl of SUMO Master Mix solution; place in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, at room temperature. It is recommended to prepare fresh SUMO Master Mix solution (see Recipe 2).Remove 2 μl of transcription/translation product and add to the 28 μl SUMO Master Mix, for a total volume of 30 μl, pipetting gently several times up and down to mix, at room temperature.Incubate each reaction in a 30 °C water bath (see Note C).Add 20 μl of sample buffer (2x) to stop the reaction.Place on a 95 °C heat block for 5 min.Briefly centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 30-60 sec, at room temperature.",
    "SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPrepare a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel.Load 10 μl of completed reaction to a well in a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel, reserving a lane for 2 μl of protein ladder (lane 1).Run SDS-PAGE at 70 V, room temperature, for approximately 20 min, or until the bottom dye indicator reaches just below the stacking gel and in the running gel. Run at 120 V, room temperature, for an additional 2 h. Stop electrophoresis before the 10 kDa molecular weight marker reaches the bottom of the gel (or until the bottom dye indicator just reaches the bottom of the gel).Gently separate gel plates using a spatula. Gently slide surgical blade along sides of the glass plate to release gel and remove the stacking gel away from the running gel with blade and discard.Carefully remove the gel and place in a small dish or plastic container (a pipet tip box lid is suitable) pre-filled with destaining buffer at room temperature.Wash with gentle shaking for 10 min, at room temperature.Carefully discard destaining buffer (free [35S]-Methionine may be in the solution, so pour in a radiation waste container).Add MilliQ water and wash with gently shaking for 10 min, at room temperature. Repeat at least 3 times (see Notes).AutoradiographyLay a piece of WhatmanTM paper on a clean benchtop space demarked as a radiation exposure area (room temperature).Carefully place gel onto the WhatmanTM paper so that lane 1 is the protein ladder.Overlay the gel with a piece of plastic wrap.Lay the gel and WhatmanTM paper onto the gel dryer (the WhatmanTM paper is placed directly onto the foam of the gel dryer and the plastic wrap is on top).Gently cover the gel and dry for approximately 30 min (see Notes).",
    "Carefully remove the plastic wrap from the gel and place on benchtop demarked as a radiation exposure area for 5 min.In a dark room protected from light, place the dried gel affixed to the WhatmanTM paper inside the cassette.Carefully place a sheet of X-ray film on top of the gel.Carefully close the cassette. Do not bring into contact with light.Keep the cassette in a dark area overnight at room temperature.Develop the exposed film according to manufacturer’s instructions.Note: For a video and detailed protocol for how to perform autoradiography, please refer to Karra et al. (2017)."
