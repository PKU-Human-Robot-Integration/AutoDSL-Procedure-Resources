It is advised to perform a viral titer optimization a priori. This can be done in a sequential manner, starting with the two viruses in parallel (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A–3D), before conducting a final titration step with the combination of these two. Once the optimal titer for each virus is known, it serves as a starting reference to define the optimal titer for the combination of two viruses (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E and 3F). Each chosen titer should be tested at least in two animals to minimize the impact of eventual pipetting or injection errors.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1228-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Titration procedure to achieve optimal calcium indicator/opsin co-expression\n(A–D) Three different titer concentrations of the virus carrying the calcium indicator (A) or opsin (C) information are diluted and injected in two independent hemispheres of two different mice (B and D).\n(E) Once the optimal concentration of indicator and opsin is defined, another titration experiment is conducted.\n(F) A solution containing both viruses at their optimal concentration (F cI) is injected in two hemispheres of two independent animals. To ensure an optimal co-expression and to exclude any interference of the viruses, a second solution (F cII) containing the optimal concentration of the calcium indicator combined with a changed titer of the virus containing the opsin and a third solution (F cIII) containing the optimal titer of the opsin in combination with a changed titer of the virus containing the calcium indicator information is injected in two hemispheres of two independent animals each.\nPrepare 6 tubes, three for each virus (calcium indicator and opsin, respectively) and label them accordingly (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3C).",
    "Critical: Before handling AAVs or any other viruses, make sure to read and adhere to the safety instructions of your institution.\nDilute the virus in sterile PBS or saline (Bennett et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) in parallel, according to the desired titer in each labeled tube. We recommend the following starting titers based on viral particle numbers ranging at:\nCamKII-GCaMP6f: undiluted, 1(GCaMP6f):20(PBS), 1:40.\nCamKII-C1V1: undiluted, 2(C1V1):1(PBS), 1:1.\nStore the tubes at 4°C, protected from light, for up to 2 weeks.\nNote: After performing the titration and evaluating both viruses independently, another titration should be conducted, commencing with the two best titers of both viruses in the same solution.\nPrepare three tubes and label them accordingly.\nPipette the virus-pair (calcium indicator + opsin) in three labeled tubes: one virus-combination constitutes the optimal titer of the respective virus defined previously. For the remaining two combinations, one titer is retained while the other titer is going to be changed (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E). In our case, the optimal titer for each virus has been confirmed as 1:20 (GCaMP6f) and 2:1 (C1V1T/T), so we chose the titer-combinations for GCaMP6f/C1V1T/T of 1:20/2:1, 1:40/2:1 and 1:20/4:1.\nStore the tubes at 4°C and avoid any light exposure.\nNote: After the best titer combination is found, we calculate the particle number as reference for further experiments. In our case, the optimal titer was 1:20/2:1, resulting in the particle numbers 1.84 × 1010/ mL and 3.33 × 1011/ mL, GCaMP6f/C1V1T/T respectively.\nCritical: Be aware if the administered virus has synapse crossing properties, e.g. rabies based viral vectors (Reardon et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]). In this case, a bilateral injection in the same animal is not advised.\nAnimal preparation (Induction of anesthesia):\nTiming: 5–10 min",
    "Weigh the animal. The age, strain and sex of the animals is defined for each study individually. In our previous study (Fu et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]), we used C57BL/6J mice (P40).\nAnesthetize the animal, by placing the mouse in an anesthesia induction chamber (4% Isoflurane/oxygen).\nUnder visual control, wait until the breathing rate of the animal drops to approximately 60 BPM.\nAdminister local analgesia, in our case by injecting buprenorphine (diluted with sterile water or saline for injection) subcutaneously with a concentration of 0.05–0.1 mg/kg.\nPlacement of animal in stereotaxic system:\nTiming: 15–20 min\nImmediately transfer the deeply anesthetized animal to the stereotaxic frame. Position the upper front teeth into the dedicated opening of the tooth bar. In case volatile anesthetics is used, cover the nose with the anesthesia mask and ensure it fits tightly. The isoflurane level typically is set to 2%.\nTest the animal’s reflexes, by pinching the skin between the toes of the medial with a forceps. If no reflex is observed, continue with the next step. If reflexes are observed, slowly increase the anesthesia.\nMonitor the temperature of the animal ideally by a closed loop in vivo monitoring system comprising of a temperature sensor, heating plate and control electronics. Insert the temperature sensor into the rectum of the animal and set the desired temperature value (37°C–38°C).\nCritical: Observe the respiration carefully. Throughout surgery, take utmost care to ensure that respiration rate exceeds 30 breaths per minute. Avoiding gasping of the animal is crucial. Once it enters this respiratory stage, the animal is unlikely to achieve a stable state of anesthesia, even if isoflurane level is decreased.\nShave the head with an electric hair trimmer (the shaved area should be larger than the actual opening for the injection/window) and carefully clean up after then.",
    "Apply an eye cream containing the agent dexpanthenol (Vidisic) to avoid the eyes drying out.\nApply 2% xylocaine solution on the surgery area (several minutes before the surgery/opening). We use 10–20 mg xylocaine.\nFix the head firmly with the ear bars and make sure to check the front-back and left-right alignment.\nCraniotomy:\nTiming: 15–20 min\nCut the scalp with a scalpel blade at the midline sagittal suture (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]I).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1228-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Accessing the injection site\n(I) An incision is made on the scalp with a scalpel blade to reveal the skull. (II) The skull is cleaned using triangle sponges and PBS. (III) After the skull is thoroughly cleaned, the injection site is marked for drilling the craniotomy. The scale bars are 1 mm.\nPull the scalp aside, peel/cut the periosteum off, clean and expose the skull with triangle sponges (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]II).\nAttach an 18G needle to the stereotaxic frame and match its tip to bregma. Set the coordinates of the micromanipulator to zero. All coordinates refer to the bregma location.\nMove the tip of the needle to the injection point by operating the manipulator according to the desired coordination for injection. In our case, for visual cortex we use anterior posterior 3.0 mm and medial lateral 2.8 mm. Mark the position(s) on the skull using ink (Skin Marker) that was administered on the tip of the needle (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]III).\nPerform the craniotomy employing a dental drill (0.5 mm diameter of the drill bit)\nFirst, thin the skull at the respective location (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]I–III).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1228-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Performing the craniotomy to access the brain for virus injection",
    "(I) The skull is thinned out using a dental drill. (II) Overview of the craniotomy shortly before the brain is exposed and a magnification (III) of the preparation of the injection site. Both images show the same time point in the surgery. The scale bars in (I) and (II) are 1 mm, the scale bar in (III) is 0.5 mm.\nCritical: It is of utmost importance to drill very slowly and carefully when getting closer to break through the skull to avoid puncturing the brain (see troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]). Furthermore, setting the drill speed too high can cause high temperatures damaging the brain tissue. Saline or PBS should be poured every 2–3 min on the drilling site to prevent heating damage.\nFinally, gently flip up the thinned skull fragment using a 20G needle or a fine tip forceps (see troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nCritical: The opening area should always be covered with saline or PBS or surgical sponge soaked with these solutions, to prevent tissue damage due to dehydration until the surgery is completed.\nInjection of virus solution for titration\nTiming: 25–30 min\nExchange the 18G needle with the pulled micropipette in the stereotaxic frame, connect the syringe with tubing to the end of the micropipette. The syringe will be used to apply and control pressure to the attached micropipette to manually load and inject the virus (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]I).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1228-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Injection of the viral vectors",
    "(I) The micropipette is mounted to the arm of the stereotaxic frame and is positioned in the right angel and coordinate to enter the exposed brain. (II) A piece of parafilm is placed onto the animal’s head and 1 μL of the virus solution is dropped on it. The micropipette is lowered until the tip is placed inside the drop of the solution and front-loaded by applying negative pressure via the syringe connected to the backend of the micropipette. When the virus solution is loaded into the micropipette, withdraw it by operating the micromanipulator and remove the parafilm. (III) The micropipette containing the solution is lowered into the injection site at a depth of 250 μm and the virus is administered at three different depths: 250 μm, 200 μm and 150 μm with an angle of 35°. The micropipette is indicated by white dashed lines. The scale bar in (III) is 0.5 mm.\nNote: In our laboratory, we prefer the manual injection, as this procedure allows the experimenter to observe and ensure that the virus solution is injected and control any clogging of the injection pipette.\nPlace a disinfected piece of parafilm (approx. 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm) on the top of the surgical sponge that is covering the craniotomy. Lower the tip of the micropipette for the injection (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]I). In our case, we perform the injection with an angle of 35°.",
    "Note: Injection with an angle will decrease the virus spillover, as the micropipette will further penetrate a longer distance in the tissue leading to a better dispersion of the virus. Furthermore, the damage in the tissue caused by the micropipette track will promote less interference during image acquisition. If you are using an angle for injection, make sure to recalculate the penetration depth correspondingly to reach the region of interest.\nApply a drop of the virus solution, in our case 1.0 μL, onto the parafilm (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]II).\nCritical: The virus solution should always be kept at 4°C until it is applied onto the parafilm. The steps c to h should not last more than 15–20 min.\n“Front-load” the virus into the micropipette by operating the micromanipulator with the attached pipette. When the micropipette is located in the center of the drop, pull the connected syringe to load the virus solution until the necessary volume of 0.6 μL is reached. Gently retract the micropipette (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]II).\nRemove the parafilm and move the micropipette back to the injection point until it touches the surface of the brain.\nReset the z-axis of the micromanipulator to zero.\nAdvance the micropipette slowly into the brain (ca. 150–250 μm in z-coordinate, (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]III). In our case, multiple injections points along the z-axis are performed. Therefore, we use a total volume of 0.6 μL for injection. At each injection point, administer 200 nL virus volume.\nNote: Multi-injections at several z-coordinates above the initial injection site can make a broader expression of the virus. We recommend injecting the virus solution in three depths, along the injection site. In our case, we inject at 250 μm, 200 μm and 150 μm with an angle of 35°.",
    "Carefully apply pressure onto the syringe to inject the virus solution into the brain. Control the speed of injection by observing the ink markers on the micropipette and regulating the pressure in parallel. The injection rate should be in a range of ≤ 0.20 μL/min.\nKeep the micropipette in place for another 5–10 min after the injection is finished. This allows the dispersion of the virus solution in the brain and minimizes upward flow of virus solution after raising the micropipette.\nWithdraw the micropipette slowly.\nClean the injection point with saline/PBS. Put the scalp back to the original place and suture it or front-load a micropipette with surgical glue for sealing the incision (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]I–III).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1228-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Closing the exposed skull\n(I) The scalp is carefully moved back to its original position with a triangle sponge and the skin is glued using surgical glue (II). To ensure that the skin is not glued to the skull, use a forceps, and move the glued skin from one side to another. The scale bars are 2 mm.\nCarefully administer the glue on the incision and make sure to not let it get under the skin: by moving the scalp from one side to another to ensure the scalp is not adhered to the skull by remnants of the glue, which would be detrimental to the healing process (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]III).\nNote: To front-load the micropipette with surgical glue, first use a small spring scissor to cut the tip of a pulled micropipette to create a large opening of approx. 0.5 mm, then dip it into a surgical glue drop. Capillary forces will suck the surgical glue into the micropipette.\nHistology for characterization of the calcium indicator/opsin co-expression\nTiming: 4–5 days\nNote: 4–6 weeks post injection is the ideal time for virus expression.",
    "Initially transcardially perfuse the animal with PBS to remove blood residues. Afterwards, switch the perfusion solution to 4% PFA to fix the tissue. We suggest using a peristaltic pump for this procedure.\nRemove the brain of the animal without damaging it and post-fix it in 4% PFA for 24 h, e.g., in a falcon tube. Use sufficient amount of PFA to cover the brain.\nAfter 24 h, start dehydrating the tissue by transferring the brain to a falcon tube containing 15% sucrose for 24 h.\nOn the following day, transfer the tissue to a new falcon tube containing 30% sucrose for another 24 h.\nNote: The volume of the sucrose solution should exceed at least 5–10 times the volume of the brain.\nSlice the brain region of interest (70 μm thickness) using a Vibratome. In our case, we cut the brain in coronal slices.\nSlices should be directly transferred onto object slides.\nThe slices should be marked with a nucleic acid stain shortly before mounting, e.g., DAPI, following the safety instructions and the protocol of the agent. Mount the slice with Vectashield Mounting Medium and fixate it with a cover slip.\nBrain tissue sections should be imaged with a confocal microscope (Figures 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A–8C). Typically, first, an overview image to ascertain the volume of opsin or indicator expression with a 10× objective is advised. Filter settings and laser power levels depend both on the fluorophore and the confocal hardware. Homogenous staining, as described below, is best assessed by a 40× objective, or, in case of axonal or dendritic staining, by a 63× objective.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1228-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8.

    "(A and B) CamKII-GCaMP6f, represented in green, and CamKII-C1V1T/T in red, are mostly expressed in neurons in layer II/III, V and VI. An excerpt of a co-expressing neuron is highlighted in the upper right corner.\n(C) A magnification of an overlay of both channels is showing co-expressing neurons in yellow, indicated by white arrows. The scale bars in (A) and (B) are 100 μm, scale bar in (C) is 25 μm. The scale bars of the insets in (A) and (B) are 25 μm.\nThe optimal titer will then be determined depending on the outcome of the following procedure:\nTo determine the density of calcium indicator and opsin expressing cells, all cells with smooth and strong expression within the volume are counted separately for each layer by using the cell counter plug-in of ImageJ (Plugins – Analyze – Cell Counter, see section code availability[href=https://www.wicell.org#da0010]).\nThe density of cells per mm3 in cortical layers II/III, IV, V/VI are calculated by dividing the total number of cells within the volume of strong yet homogenous fluorescence in each layer by the volume. The two independently injected hemispheres for each titer concentration are considered on this calculation. Further information regarding titration evaluation can be found in the references (Fu et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]; Döring et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nNote: Judging the quality of confocal micrographs depends on several experiment specific factors, such as the targeted cell population, the type of virus used and the brain region. However, in our experiments, we aim for an outcome exhibiting homogeneous expression along the neuronal somata, the absence of blebbing and fluorescent punctae as well as a nucleus free staining.

(2018)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib32].\nPart 2: Chronic window implantation for longitudinal 2-photon calcium imaging\nVirus injection and chronic window implantation:",
    "Timing: 60–120 min\nPrepare the virus solution according to \"Protocol Part 1\": 1d–f, repeat 2a–d and 3a–g.\nMake an incision: cut the scalp with a scalpel blade at the midline sagittal suture, then use a small spring scissor to partially remove the scalp from the skull (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]I–II).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1228-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. Commencing the surgery for chronic window implantation\nThe scalp is removed by initially making medial incision with a scissor, followed by cutting the scalp in a circular manner (I–II). The periosteum is peeled off and the skull thoroughly cleaned with sponge and PBS (II). Ink-mark the tip of a needle to locate the bregma for defining the zero-position of the micromanipulator (III). The scale bars are 2 mm.\nCritical: the exposed skull surface must be smaller than the shaved region so the adhesive (i.e.: dental cement, UV-Glue, etc.) will not be on top of the hair. The exposed surface should not include the neck/facial muscles for avoiding muscle inflammation caused by the glue. An inflamed muscle may lead to a reduced adhesion of the UV-glue or dental cement.\nPeel or cut off the periosteum, clean the exposed skull with triangle sponges drenched in PBS.\nUse a scalpel blade to scratch the remaining tissue/fascia from the skull carefully. The surface of the skull needs to be clean and dry.\nCritical: This step is essential for the attachment of adhesive, it is crucial to perform this step with utmost care, even though it might be time consuming. A sloppy cleaning of the skull`s surface might result in an insufficient adhesion of the glue and a loss of the headholder (Hefendehl et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]).\nAttach an 18G needle to the stereotaxic frame and match its tip to bregma (Figures 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]III and 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]I–II). Set the micromanipulator coordinates to zero (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]I).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1228-Fig10.jpg",

Preparing the craniotomy site\nThe tip of the ink-marked needle is located at the site for performing the craniotomy (I). Here, we located the primary visual cortex V1 at the coordinates AP 3.0 mm ML 2.8 mm. A biopsy punch is used to create a ledger line as a guide for the subsequent craniotomy (II). The borders of the skin are sealed with surgical glue for a more stable preparation (III). The scale bars are 1 mm.\nPlace a piece of surgical sponge soaked in PBS/Saline on top of the injection site and keep it there for a few minutes in order to soften the skull. This will simplify the drilling and flipping-up of the bone fragment in the following steps.\nRemove the sponge and use a biopsy puncher to make a very shallow cut around the central point of the injection site as a landmark for a round craniotomy (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]II).

The white dashed lines serve as illustration for the desired pattern (I). Apply UV-glue in layers onto the skull and hardening them with UV-light after placing each layer (II). Implant the holder by gluing it on the last layers (III). The scale bars in (I), (II) are 1 mm, the scale bar in (III) is 2 mm.\nPrepare the adhesive (dental cement or UV-glue) and use a 20G needle for applying it on the exposed skull. Make sure to apply the adhesive only on the exposed skull and not to the skin (Figure 13[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig13]II).\nNote: The size of the headholder needs to be big enough to cover both hemispheres of the skull (Figure 14[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig14]). A two to four point fixation with the fixation points located at two hemispheres is mandatory to ensure a movement artefact free recording.\nCritical: When using cement, make sure that the cement is not too fluid nor too dense. When using UV-Glue, apply the glue in small layers and expose it to UV-light after each layer. Do not administer a big amount of UV-glue at once to avoid a hardening of the upper layer while the lower layers remain viscous which can lead to an instability of the headholder (see troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).",
    "While applying the first layer of adhesive around the coverslip, take care to only cover its borders with adhesive.

When using UV glue, apply some glue to the base of the head holder and then place it on top of the previously administered layer of UV glue.\nMake sure that the adhesive is completely dry before moving the animal from the stereotaxic frame.\nPart 3: 2-P all-optical experiment\n2-P all-optical experiments require a dedicated hardware for, ideally, photostimulate opsin expressing cells while fast full-field imaging the field of view. It has to be noted, that excitation wavelengths that are close to each other might lead to a cross-talk between the channels. We propose to choose the calcium indicator/opsin pair that the spectral wavelengths for imaging and excitation are as separated as possible to avoid cross-talk from 2-P stimulation during image acquisition. An overview of commonly used calcium indicators and opsins are shown in Figure 15[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig15] to serve as an orientation for choosing the best suited pair. Note that it is also possible to reach spectral independency using a blue shifted opsin like the newly developed stCoChR, a soma-targeted variant of the opsin CoChR, while 2-P imaging the neuronal micronetwork with the red-shifted calcium indicator jRCaMP1a (Forli et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1228-Fig15.jpg",

A selection of calcium indicator opsin pairs and their spectral properties under a two-photon regime\nCross-talk between indicator and opsin can be avoided by choosing a pair with non-overlapping excitation and emission wavelengths. For example, we used the combination of GCaMP6f, excited at 920 nm, and C1V1T/T was excited above 1100 nm to reach cross-talk free imaging (Chen et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Fu et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]; Lin et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]; Ronzitti et al., 2017a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]; Papagiakoumou et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]; Chettih and Harvey, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nFigure adapted from Chen et al.

Furthermore, transient inflammation caused by the surgical procedure can cease.\nTransfer the animal to the microscope (Figure 16[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig16]). Mount the headholder (Hefendehl et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]) to a restraining device under the microscopes’ objective.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1228-Fig16.jpg\nFigure 16. A head-restrained mouse under the objective of a 2-P microscope.\nNote: This protocol can be applied to both, anesthetized and awake imaging experiments. If the experiment is carried out in awake animals, perform a habituation prior to the imaging session. This is necessary to reduce the stress load of the animal during the experiment and consequently affects the quality of your data. Plan approximately 5 days for habituation for each animal. On the first 2 days, handle the animal 15–20 min and let it get used to the experimenter. On day 3 and 4, restrain the animal’s head and on day 5 restrain the animal under the microscope without imaging.",
    "Use a femtosecond pulsed laser and resonant scanner for fast full-field scanning up to 35 Hz for imaging the calcium indicator expressing cells. In our case, we use a Titan-Sapphire (Ti:Sa) laser at 920 nm (Figure 17[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig17]III) (see troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]). For a schematic overview of the microscopic system used for our experiments, please see Fu et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14] and Döring et al. (2018)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1228-Fig17.jpg\nFigure 17. Overview of the user interface of the software Imspector controlling the 2-P microscope\nRegion of interest (ROI) for photostimulation are defined and settings such as pixel dwell times and line width can be adapted (I). The recorded field of view for functional calcium imaging and the sensitivity of the PMTs are adjusted (II). The wavelength of the laser for calcium indicator (III) and opsin excitation is set and the shutters are controlled (IV). Properties of the lasers for photostimulation and imaging can be modified (V). The figure is published with the kind permission of LaVision BioTec GmbH, Bielefeld, Germany.\nImages were acquired by a Zeiss W-Plan-Apochromatic 20 × DIC VIS-IR objective (NA = 1.0) (Figure 17[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig17]II), resulting in a field of view (FOV) of 466 × 466 μm. However, the actual dimension of the recorded FOV depends on the used objective and its magnification properties. Typically, the FOV is represented in a matrix of 512 × 512 pixels (see troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nFor opsin excitation, an independent laser should be used to temporally uncouple opsin and indicator excitation, enabling a simultaneous readout of the microcircuits response upon optogenetic manipulation of single neurons. In our case, we used an optical parametric oscillator (OPO) at 1100 nm pumped by a Ti:Sa laser at 800 nm (Figure 17[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig17]V).",
    "Note: In resonant scanning full field mode of our experiment, the pixel dwell time ranges at 1 μs, which might be too short to efficiently excite an opsin. To achieve longer pixel dwell times, either use a second galvo-resonant mirror system or a spatial light modulator for scanless excitation of opsin expressing cells.\nSignals may be collected by a dual – PMT solution: The first PMT is equipped with a spectral bandpass filter matching the emission properties of the calcium indicator. A second PMT needs to be operated with a bandpass filter matching the properties of the fluorescence reporter of the opsin (Figure 17[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig17]II).\nNote: During the experiment, the co-expression of the recorded field of view needs to be evaluated. Therefore, two PMTs are necessary to identify co-expressing neurons in the ongoing experiment.\nA region of interest (ROI)-based raster-scan stimulation of previously identified co-expressing cells is carried out. Alternatively, if a spatial light modulator (SLM) is implemented in the microscopes beam path, excitation is conducted in a scanless manner by modulating the electric field of the laser beam, enabling the generation of multiple focus points (Figure 17[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig17]I). For a more detailed and technical explanation, please see Papagiakoumou et al. (2010)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21].\nStimulation is delivered by a pixel dwell time of 6 μs, in case of C1V1, but this strongly depends on the opsin used, and a line scan resolution of 0.5–2 μm (Figure 17[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig17]I) to cover the entire membrane surface area containing the opsins. Note, that the effective spatial coverage is determined by the point spread function (PSF). It is advisable to measure the PSF as part of the regular quality control of the used microscope.\nPart 4: Identification and binarization of putative AP-related calcium transient\nIdentification and binarization of putative AP-related calcium transient.\nTiming: 5–6 h",
    "Export the imaging data as a series of single tiffs or tiff stack.\nIn functional 2-P imaging, motion artefacts induced by heartbeat or breathing, and, especially in awake recordings, movement of the animal can affect the quality of the measurement. Motion artefacts in x–y direction can be compensated for by performing a motion correction, in our case we use the moco plugin of ImageJ (see section code availability[href=https://www.wicell.org#da0010]). Here, all images within a time-lapse image series are aligned with a reference image. The reference image is a single frame from the entire time-series that comprises a high amount of visible neurons. Alternatively, an average intensity projection of the entire time-series can be calculated using the ImageJ function “z-project” and chose “average” projection. This can be necessary if the signal-noise ratio (SNR) is low. Note, that also other projection types can be used depending on the quality of your recording, e.g., a maximum or a median intensity projection if the contrast is low.\nNote: Motion correction is crucial for the next step to guarantee that an identified neuron does not move out of the boundaries defining its outline (see troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).",
    "For the identification of neuronal somata in the microcircuit, each soma is identified as functional unit and is defined and segmented as a ROI. In our case, we use a custom written Matlab script. The motion corrected single tiffs or the tiff stacks are loaded into Matlab and an average intensity projection is calculated. The projection is used to mark all identifiable neurons with polygon shapes, defining them as ROIs (Figures 18[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig18]A and 18B). Especially for neurons located at the boarders of the FOV, the contrast can often be low. Therefore, the Matlab figure properties can be used to adapt brightness properties of the projection, simplifying the identification of neurons exhibiting a weak baseline fluorescence. These figure properties can be accessed choosing “Edit” and “Colormap”.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1228-Fig18.jpg\nFigure 18. Preprocessing and segmentation of neuronal somata for subsequent analysis\nPrior segmentation, basic parameters of the recording need to be stated: an average intensity projection (AvgIP) is calculated based on the stated number of frames that should be considered in the projection.\n(A) The dimensions of the field of view need to be stated in μm and the sample rate of the image acquisition is reported (A).\n(B) Each somata in the field of view is now labeled by drawing a polygon around its border (B). This is reiterated for all visible neurons in the field of view. The averaged intensity of the enclosed pixels over time is calculated for each ROI and displayed as intensity trace. The scale bars in (B) are 20 μm.\n(C) To calculate the relative change of fluorescence, a baseline free of activity is defined for each intensity trace, indicated by the green dashed boxes (C).",
    "Note: In recent years a variety of tools based on mathematical models were developed to automatize the step of segmentation, like deep-learning based algorithms (Soltanian-Zadeh et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28]; Klibisz et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]). However, these algorithms are reaching their limits when applied on datasets of varying quality, e.g. datasets of a particularly low SNR. Furthermore, depending on the algorithm used, a dedicated training set is needed. We suggest to perform a manual segmentation to ensure a reliable identification of neuronal somata in the recorded microcircuit.\nThe change in fluorescence for each neuron, identified as a functional unit, needs to be represented as a series of values in an array for further analysis. For this, average all intensity values of all pixels within each ROI for every image of the series of single tiffs or the tiff stack, resulting in an intensity trace for every ROI (see troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nDefine a 10 s long period of quiescence characterized by the absence of functional calcium transient or signal fluctuations as baseline F0 separately for each neuron and calculate the relative change of fluorescence for each time point F with   Δ F =   F −  F 0    F 0     (Figure 18[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig18]C).\nCritical: The absolute level of intensity is based on multiple factors such as autofluorescence, the expression level of the calcium indicator, or the influence of stray light. Therefore, it is recommended to calculate the relative change of fluorescence. Because these dynamic changes, depending on their temporal dynamics, are most likely due to changes in intracellular calcium levels and can therefore be termed as calcium transients.",
    "To verify that all identified functional units exhibit physiological meaningful signal components as expected from neurons, the data is loaded into IGOR Pro. With a custom written code each intensity trace is smoothed by a Gaussian filter and inspected for ongoing neuronal activity during the measurement. At this step, unwanted or falsely identified structures can be manually excluded from the analysis (Figure 19[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig19]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1228-Fig19.jpg\nFigure 19. Binarization of putatively AP related calcium transients\n(A) The imported data (blue) is initially smoothed by a gaussian filter (red) and intensity traces are inspected for the presence of functional calcium transients of physiological origin. At this step, every intensity trace that is not exhibiting calcium transients or does not represent a somata can be excluded from further analysis.The scale bar is 100% dF/F.\n(B) Calcium transients are identified by a standard deviation-based threshold. The onset of the transient is detected when the amplitude of the peak falls below 0.5 SD of the baseline value. The grey line indicates the calculated first derivative of the smoothed raw trace. The scale bar is 100% dF/F.\n(C) The offset of a calcium transient is then calculated by fitting an exponential curve (black) to the peak to model the decay dynamics of the calcium indicator. When the fitted curve crosses 0.5 SD of the baseline, the offset is detected. The scale bar is 100% dF/F.",
    "Calcium indicators show rather stereotypical signal characteristics. At this step, we are inspecting every intensity trace to identify the presence of these characteristic components. In our case, we use the calcium indicator GCaMP6f, exhibiting a sharp onset, followed by an exponential decay. These dynamics are modelled in our analysis routine for each intensity trace, initially by detecting the onset, peak and offset of an AP calcium transient by a standard deviation-based threshold algorithm:\nThe mean value of the intensity trace is calculated.\nAmplitudes exceeding 3–3.5 standard deviations (SD) above the mean are detected (Figure 19[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig19]B). By specifying a refraction time, the minimum time difference that must lie between two peaks can be defined.\nFor peak identification of calcium transients, two criteria need to be fulfilled: the first derivative of the amplitude has to cross zero, the second derivate has to be negative (Figure 19[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig19]B).\nThe onset of the calcium transient is identified as the first data point that dropped below 0.5 SD of the baseline.\nThe offset of the calcium transient is determined by fitting an exponential curve to the trace, mimicking the    τ  o f f     of the calcium indicator, and identifying the data point after the peak when the fitted curve reaches 0.5 SD of the baseline (Figure 19[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig19]C). Without a priori knowledge of the calcium indicator dynamics, a reliable identification of AP-related calcium transients is not advisable.\nIf necessary, peak locations can be corrected manually.\nIntensity traces are binarized such as that peaks are represented as 1 and periods of quiescence are represented as 0.\nNote: The here proposed pipeline for binarizing calcium transients is based on Matlab and IGOR Pro. However, the procedures can also be implemented in any other programming language or analysis software, e.g. Python, LabView, Java and many others."
