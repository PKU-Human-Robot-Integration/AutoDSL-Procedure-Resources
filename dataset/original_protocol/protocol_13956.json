    "NOTE: The protocol of one exposure experiment covers a period of three days.\nDay 1\n1. General preparations and cultivation of cells\nNOTE: The human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line A549 was used for exposure experiments. Cells must be handled under sterile conditions. Other cell lines that are suitable for cultivation at the ALI can be used.\nPrepare the growth medium (Dulbecco's Minimum Essential Medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 5 µg/mL gentamycin) and the exposure medium (DMEM, supplemented with 5 µg/mL gentamycin and a final HEPES concentration of 100 mM).\nCulture A549 cells in growth medium at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.\nCultivate cells in cell culture flask of 75 cm2 (T-75) in 14 mL of growth medium until a confluence of 80-90% before splitting (every 2-3 days) and a passage of 35.\nCalculate the suspension volume and the required number of cell culture inserts (three cell culture inserts as incubator controls and cell culture inserts for clean air and particle exposure) and cell culture plates.\nBefore trypsinization and seeding of cells, add 2.5 mL of tempered growth medium to each well of a 6-well plate. Place the cell culture inserts without cells carefully inside the wells and add 1 mL growth medium to every cell culture insert. Incubate the 6-well plates for at least 30 min in the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2).\n2. Trypsinization of cells\nTemper phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and growth medium at 37 °C and the trypsin/EDTA (0.05%/ 0.02%) solution at room temperature.\nAspirate the cell culture medium from the cell culture flask and wash the cells carefully with 8 mL of pre-heated PBS.",
    "Remove the PBS, add 2 mL of the trypsin/EDTA (0.05%/ 0.02%) solution to the cells and incubate for maximal 6 min. in the incubator at 37 °C. Control the detachment process under the microscope.\nNeutralize the trypsin activity by adding 8 mL pre-heated growth medium, detach the cells by gently tapping sideways on the flask and resuspend the cells by repeated pipetting up and down.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 50 mL tube. Determine the cell number for further procedure (e.g., seeding of cells, passage of cells).\n3. Determination of cell number\nNOTE: Cell concentration was determined using a cell counter or counting chambers.\nDilute 100 µL of the cell culture suspension in a cup filled with 10 mL of isotonic solution. Tilt the cup slowly without shaking.\nDetermine number of viable cells/mL and cell viability based on the cell-specific measurement parameters of A549 cells.\n4. Seeding of cells onto microporous membranes in cell culture inserts\nNOTE: The exposure system is equipped with special adapters to enable the use of commercial inserts from different suppliers and of different sizes. For these exposure experiments, 6-well plates and the corresponding cell culture inserts were used. All working steps have to be done under sterile conditions.\nProvide pre-heated growth medium under sterile cell culture conditions (laminar flow).\nPrepare a sufficiently high volume of the cell suspension with a cell concentration of 3.0 x 105 cells/mL.\nAfter tempering the plates for 30 min, aspirate the medium within the cell culture inserts and seed 1 mL of A549 cells with a density of 3.0 x 105 cells/mL in each cell culture insert. Distribute the cell suspension by gentle rocking.\nIncubate the cell culture inserts with the cell suspension for 24 h (37 °C and 5% CO2).\n5. Pressing of test substances",
    "NOTE: Test substances were pressed into powder cakes using a fully controllable hydraulic press. The press package can apply a maximum force of 18 kN, which is displayed as the current oil pressure (in bar) of the press package. Press conditions (pressing pressure, time of pressing) of unknown test substances have to be established and characterized in preliminary tests. Depending on the press properties of a substance, different pressing parameters and kinds of pressing plunger can be used.\nCAUTION: Wear protective equipment when pressing toxic or dangerous substances.\nSet the pressing time via the time control on the front side of the press.\nOpen the compressed air supply at the compressed air valve. Set the compressed air pressure to approximately 2 bar (indicated by a pressure gauge on the front side) using the pressure regulator on the front side of the press or on the compressed air valve of the compressed air supply. Pull out the drawer, press the Press button and read the pressing pressure on the digital pressure switch.\n\t\nRead just the pressure at the pressure regulator if the pressure is too high or too low.\nAssembly the substance container and ensure that the glass cylinder is correctly centered (Supplementary Figure 1). Fill the substance container with a small amount of the test substance. Insert the plunger into the substance container and turn it slightly back and forth to evenly distribute the powder in the container.\nPlace the substance container with the plunger in the drawer and press the Press button. The hydraulic piston of the press moves onto the plunger and exerts a pressure on the test substance for the set pressing time. Open the drawer and remove the plunger.\nRepeat steps 5.3 and 5.4 until the substance container is at least half full.",
    "After completion of the pressing work, remove the substance container from the drawer and turn it upside down to remove loose and deposited particles.\nIf the substance container is not needed at the same day, close the substance container with parafilm in order to prevent the test substance from drying out or absorbing moisture.\nDay 2\n6. Assembly of the exposure system and connecting the peripheral equipment\nNOTE: A more detailed view is provided in Figure 3, Supplementary Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 3. Assemble both modules and the aerosol generator according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nPlace the exposure system on a solid and even surface, with the water supply facing forward. Connect the mass flow controllers with the aerosol generator and a three-necked bottle connected to the module for clean air exposure.\nConnect the flow controller and the vacuum pump. Connect the tubes from the flow controllers with the tube connector on the attachments of the aerosol guiding module. Connect the tubes on the other side of the flow controllers with the vacuum pump. Make sure that the flow is going from the module through the flow controllers to the vacuum pump.\nConnect the water bath with the heating water supply. The water supply is going from the water bath to the water inlet on the aerosol guiding module. Connect the water outlet of the aerosol guiding module with the water inlet of the sampling module. Close the circle with a connection from the water outlet of the sampling module to the water bath.",
    "Place the aerosol generator including the elutriator close to the exposure module and connect the excess lines of the elutriator and the exposure and clean air module with large micro filters, and the suction of the exposure chambers with small micro filters (e.g., disposable filters). The elutriator serves as a reservoir for the generated particulate atmosphere and retains particles bigger than approx. 7 µm, whereas smaller particles are transported to the exposure module.\nConnect the computer used to control the aerosol generation to the USB port of the aerosol generator top via a USB cable and the power supply to the power supply port. Connect the AC power plug of the power supply unit to a socket (220-240 V).\nConnect the pipes for the medium supply and removal with two pumps. Instead of using a pump for the medium supply, the medium can also be filled manually.\n7. Preparation for clean air and particle exposure\nTurn on the vacuum pump, the flow controllers and the water bath (37 °C) for a warm-up period of at least 30 min.\nOpen the compressed air supply. Set the mass flow controllers to 8 L/min for the supply line to the aerosol generator and to 3 L/min for the supply line to the three-necked bottle. Close the tabs of the mass flow controllers.\n\tNOTE: These values may vary depending on the characteristics of the test substance.\nAdjust the flow controllers via the computer to regulate the module flow (1.5 L/min) and the chamber suction (30 mL/min).\n8. Leakage test of the radial flow system\nNOTE: The leakage check must be performed under vacuum and for both modules (exposure and clean air module) in order to ensure that the module has been reassembled properly.",
    "Remove the inlet adapter and the condensate reflector from the aerosol guiding module. Close the three aerosol feeding bores in the aerosol guiding module with plugs and the medium supply connections at the sampling module with dummy flaps.\nConnect the vacuum lines without the filter with the tube connector of the aerosol guiding module. Close the module by using the hand wheel and measure the value of the flow controllers. The values should decrease some minutes after closing below 5 mL/min.\nAfter the impermeability check, remove all plugs and dummy flaps, insert the inlet adapter and the condensate reflector into the aerosol guiding module and connect the pipes for medium supply and removal.\n9. Aerosol generation\nStart the computer and the software (Supplementary Figure 4). Start the aerosol generator software by double clicking on the aerosol generator start button on the desktop of the computer. A message window appears and asks if the settings should be reset or not. Click Yes if the software is started for the first time that day. Set the values for Slide Position and Scraper Position to the default values. Click No to keep the values for Slide Position and Scraper Position or the slide is not in the starting position.\nScrew a substance scraper into the pipe, which is located in the central opening of the aerosol generator top.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the press characteristics, distinct types of substance scraper can be used.\nUse the button Homing Mode if the substance scraper is not in the lowest position.",
    "Place the substance container with the pressed test material upside down over the substance scraper. Ensure that the glass of the substance container faces the front. Make sure that the two holes in the substance container fit onto the two pins of the aerosol generator top. Place the locking plate in the slot over the substance container and tighten the black screw.\nChange the values for Feed (0.24 to 20 mm/h) and Rotation (1 to 800 revs/h) to the desired settings. The particle concentration can be modified by increasing or decreasing the Feed value or the carrier gas flow rate.\nUse the downward arrows to push down the slide with the substance container until the substance scraper is near the pressed substance.\nOpen the compressed air supply to the aerosol generator with a tap of the mass flow controller and start the aerosol generation by clicking on the Start button. Set the Feed rate to 15-20 mm/h to avoid long waiting times.\nControl the correct particle generation by observing the fine dust cloud with a small flashlight (positioned from below behind the glass tube of the Elutriator). Change the value for Feed back to the desired settings when the first aerosol vapor reaches continuously the Elutriator and click on the Stop button.\n10. Exposure experiments\nStart the medium supply with pre-heated exposure medium and fill the sampling modules until the downpipes are covered while the module is open. Use the medium pump or fill the medium manually (25 mL per individual exposure chamber).\nInsert blind cell culture inserts (inserts without cells) into the exposure module. Pump the exposure medium down until the downpipes are covered with medium and the lower side of the inserts are in contact with medium.",
    "Start the aerosol generator, close the exposure module and connect the exposure module to the exposure module outlet of the aerosol generator. Give the aerosol generator a lead time of at least 20-30 min before exposures are started in order to enable a stable generation of particles.\nPrepare the post-incubation plates for the incubator controls and the exposed cell culture inserts during the lead time. Add 1.5 mL of growth medium per well and incubate the plates in the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2).\nAfter the lead time, seal the exposure module outlet of the Elutriator with a rubber plug and remove the blind inserts. Refill the exposure medium (using the pump or manually) until the downpipes are covered with medium. Now, open also the compressed air supply to the clean air module with the tap of the mass flow controller (3 L/min)\nRemove the cell culture inserts from the 6-well plates with the help of a tweezer. Pour the growth medium carefully from the cell culture inserts off by toppling the inserts and aspirate and discard the residual liquid using a pipette. Place the inserts in the exposure chambers of both modules, the exposure and clean air module.\nClose the modules and start the exposure experiments by connecting the exposure module to the exposure module outlet of the aerosol generator and the clean air module to the carrier gas supply simultaneously.\n\tNOTE:The particle concentration can be modified by increasing/decreasing the Feed value, the carrier gas flow rate or the time of exposure.\nDisconnect the exposure and clean air modules after completion of the experiment and seal the exposure module outlet.\nStop the compressed air supply and the aerosol generator by clicking on the Stop button.",
    "Open the exposure and clean air module and transfer the cell culture inserts to the prepared post-incubation plates using a tweezer. Incubate the 6-well plates for 24 h (37 °C, 5% CO2) at the ALI.\n\tNOTE: Repeat steps 10.5 -10.10 if further exposure experiments are planned.\nLift the cell culture inserts, that are used as incubator controls to the ALI under the same conditions as the exposed cell culture inserts and incubate them for 24 h (37 °C, 5% CO2) at the ALI.\nUse the button Homing Mode to remove the substance container. Close the aerosol generator software by clicking on the X in the upper right-hand corner and turn off the computer.\nAfter completion of all exposure experiments, clean the aerosol generator and both exposure modules. Close the substance container with parafilm if the test substance will be further used within the next days.\nDay 3\n11. Cell viability\nNOTE: Cell viability was determined 24 h after particle deposition by measuring the mitochondrial activity using the WST-1 assay. The assay was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cell viability can also be determined by using other cell viability tests (e.g., XTT).\nTemper growth medium at 37 °C and thaw the WST-1 solution protected from light. Prepare an appropriate number of new 6-well plates with 2.5 mL growth medium per well and incubate the plates in the incubator.\nPrepare the WST-1 dilution by diluting a sufficient amount of WST-1 1:7 in growth medium",
    "Insert the cell culture inserts 24 h after exposure in the new prepared 6-well plates. Add 1 mL of the fresh-prepared WST-1 solution to each cell culture insert. Rock the plates carefully in order to distribute the solution homogenously on the cells. Incubate the 6-well plates with the cell culture inserts for 1 h (37 °C, 5% CO2).\nTransfer 100 µL of the supernatant in triplicates from each 6-well to a 96-well plate. Measure the absorbance at 450 nm with a reference wavelength of 650 nm using a microplate reader.\n12. Statistics\nNormalize the cell viability of the individual incubator controls to 100%.\nExpress the viability of the exposed cells in relation to the individual incubator controls. Cytotoxicity of test substances was compared to the respective incubator controls and used as an indicator of toxicity.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
