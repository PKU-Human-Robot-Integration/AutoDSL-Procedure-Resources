    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nSample Loading onto Membranes\nTiming: 2.5+ h/membrane, plus thawing samples\nFollowing protein determination, samples are loaded on a nitrocellulose membrane by manual pipetting and allowed to dry thoroughly prior to staining. Careful dilution of samples and application to the membrane is important for uniform results. The use of a 96-well dot array allows for high-throughput determination of a larger number of samples (96 individual samples, or 48 samples analyzed in duplicate).\nThaw protein samples on ice. Quantify using a Bradford Assay or similar technique for total protein quantification.\nDilute the protein sample before applying to the membrane.\nEach sample must be diluted to a final concentration of 1 μg of protein in a total volume of 10 μL (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section for method optimization and selection of protein loading amount).\nStore the diluted samples on ice before loading on the membrane.\nNote: We recommend replicates of each sample be applied to the membrane for greater accuracy. We also suggest making 5–10 μL extra of each sample solution before application to ensure an adequate volume for all dots.\nUsing scissors cleaned with alcohol, cut a nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 μm) to size for the required number of samples to be dotted.\nPlace the cut membrane(s) in a container with a lid (e.g., clean pipette tip box) and cover them with TBS.\nAllow the membrane(s) to rehydrate for a minimum of 10 min before applying samples.\nNote: Multiple membranes can be placed in the same box for rehydration with TBS.\nPlace a pre-wetted membrane in the 96-well Bio-Dot® Microfiltration Apparatus (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. If less than 96 samples are applied to a membrane, cover any un-used wells with tape and seal well.",
    "Connect the vacuum line and leave it open to the atmosphere during sample application.\nNote: When setting up the Bio-Dot® Apparatus, the membrane should be marked to keep track of the orientation of samples. A notch or small hole(s) made with a clean tweezer along the edge of the membrane is ideal.\nAdd 100 μL TBS to each well of the membrane in the Bio-Dot® apparatus.\nTurn on the vacuum, and with a gloved finger, gently block the vacuum line (open to the atmosphere) to slowly increase the vacuum on the Bio-Dot® apparatus. Make sure that the TBS is vacuumed thoroughly before applying samples. Detailed information for the operation of the vacuum valve of the apparatus can be found in the product manual.\nAdd 10 μL of sample to each well of the membrane. Take care not to puncture the membrane during application with a pipette tip. Replace the pipette tip between each sample.\nAfter all samples are loaded on the membrane, cover the Bio-Dot® apparatus to prevent dust or dirt contamination (foil or a pipette lid box works well). Allow the apparatus to sit for a minimum of 1 h without vacuum to allow protein samples to bind.\nAfter 1 h, turn on the vacuum and using a gloved finger to block the vacuum line (open to the atmosphere) to gently pull any remaining sample through the membrane.\nUse a pair of clean tweezers to remove the membrane from the apparatus. Place the clean membrane on an elevated surface to dry for a minimum of 1 h.\nNote: We suggest placing the membrane on the hinge of a clean pipette tip box (with lid) to allow optimal air flow and then the membrane placed in a laminar flow hood to prevent contamination from dust or dirt.",
    "After the membrane is dried, it can be stained with Revert® 700 Total Protein Stain or it can be stored for up to one week at 4°C.\nPause Point: For long term storage, dotted membranes can be stored at 4°C for up to one week prior to staining and immunoprobing.\nRevert® 700 Total Protein Stain\nTiming: 1 h per membrane\nThe Revert® 700 Total Protein Stain (LiCor) allows for the normalization of the protein dotted on each well of the membrane. The final antibody signal is normalized against the Revert® signal to allow for more accurate quantification of total amount of applied protein and allows for the simultaneous detection of two protein targets. Re-imaging of the membrane after removing the Revert® stain accounts for residual background, especially when using two antibodies for a sample, or for detection of low-abundance proteins.\nImportant: Once the Revert® staining of the membrane is started, you must continue through each of the steps to completion (i.e., incubation with antibodies and imaging). Repeated drying of the membrane or storage in buffer for an extended period of time is not recommended.\nPlace each membrane in a clean, small container with a lid to allow the membrane/solution to gently move on a rocker. Large containers will require excess reagents (e.g., Revert®, antibodies).\nNote: For large membranes (e.g., >48 dots), a clean pipette tip box with lid works well. Small membranes (<16 dots) can be stained or immunoprobed in sterile petri dishes (>35 mm). Boxes designed for incubating western blots are suitable for medium-size membranes (16–48 dots). Volumes need to be adjusted for the type of container (e.g., a pipette tip box or container of similar size) used for the membrane.\nNote: LiCor does not recommend placing multiple membranes in a container for staining with Revert® or antibodies.",
    "Add methanol to Revert® kit reagents as described by the manufacturer. Appropriate volumes to add are indicated for each reagent.\nNote: Revert® 700 Total Protein Stain kit reagents need to be kept in a chemical safety hood when open and the waste disposed to minimize exposure to fumes.\nRinse membrane briefly with 15 mL ultrapure water before staining.\nAdd 5–10 mL (enough volume to just cover the membrane) Revert® 700 Total Protein Stain to the membrane and incubate for 5 min with gentle rocking. Keep container lid closed or if possible, place the rocker in a chemical safety hood to reduce exposure to fumes. Blue dots should become visible for protein samples that were applied to the membrane.\nNote: Lack of visible blue dots could indicate issues with protein application to the membrane.\nDecant the Revert® stain into a waste container.\nAdd 10–15 mL of Revert® Wash solution to the membrane and incubate for 30–60 s with gentle shaking/agitation.\nDecant the wash solution into a waste container and wash the membrane for 30–60 s in 15 mL ultrapure water. Decant wash solution into a waste container.\nImmediately after staining, the membrane(s) are imaged on a LiCor Odyssey® CLx near IR imager. Recommended scan settings are: medium scan quality, 84 μm resolution, and a 0.0 mm offset.\nFor a faster run time, a resolution of 169 μm can be used instead of 84 μm. We prefer the higher resolution and slightly longer run time for better dot visualization.\nUse a silicone mat and roller (LiCor) to remove any bubbles or liquid on the membrane.\nIntensities and contrast values for both channels can be optimized for each image/experiment without impacting quantification.\nSee Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section for more information on problems with the Revert® stain.",
    "Note: Clean imaging surface with alcohol prior to and after imaging the membrane.\nAfter imaging the stained membrane, add 5–10 mL of the Revert® 700 Destain solution and incubate for 5–7 min at 20°C–22°C with gentle rocking. The visible blue dots from the Revert® stain should rapidly diminish and disappear during destaining.\nDecant the Revert® Destain solution and briefly rinse the membrane with 15 mL ultrapure water.\nRe-image the destained membrane using the same imaging parameters (see step 22).\nAfter imaging the membrane, immediately block the membrane and incubate with primary antibody(s).\nIncubation with Antibodies\nTiming: 1 h, ∼16–24 h overnight incubation, 2+ h next day (+30 min/membrane)\nFollowing incubation with blocking buffer, the membrane(s) is incubated sequentially with a primary antibody and then an IRDye® conjugated secondary antibody for detection at 800 nm. If two targets are desired, the secondary antibody to the more-abundant protein is detected at 700 nm to minimize interference from residual Revert® stain (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section).\nIncubate membrane(s) with 10 mL Intercept® (TBS) Blocking Buffer (LiCOr) for 45–60 min at 20°C–22°C with gentle rocking.\nDecant the blocking buffer and add the primary antibody solution to the membrane.\nIncubate the membrane 16–24 h at 4°C with gentle rocking.\nPrimary antibodies should be made in Intercept® blocking buffer:TBS with 0.01% Tween-20 (50:50).\nIf detection of two protein targets is desired, both primary antibodies can be applied and incubated simultaneously.\nNote: Dilutions of each antibody should be determined by user. Suggested dilutions for western blotting are often appropriate, but the user should consult the data sheets for each antibody.\nOptional: Primary and secondary antibodies can also be diluted in 100% Intercept® (TBS) Blocking Buffer, but we recommend diluting the Intercept® buffer to minimize reagent use.",
    "Decant the primary antibody solution and wash the membrane successively 3 × 10 min with 15 mL of TBS +0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) at 20°C–22°C with gentle rocking.\nNote: Primary antibody can be saved and re-used depending on dilution concentration and protein abundance, ideally within a few days to minimize antibody degradation or bacterial contamination of the buffer.\nAdd the secondary antibody to the immunoprobed membrane and incubate for 1 h at 20°C–22°C.\nDilute the IRDye® secondary antibody(s) in Intercept blocking buffer: TBS with 0.01% Tween-20 (50:50) to a final concentration of 1:10,000.\nIf doing two protein targets, incubation with both secondary antibodies can be done simultaneously.\nNote: Membranes must be kept in the dark during steps 31 through the imaging step. We recommend covering the container with foil if it is not opaque.\nNote: For the detection of one protein, we recommend using the 800 nm channel for best sensitivity. For the detection of two proteins, we recommend using the more-abundant protein for the 700 nm channel. Additional support can be found for different applications can be found on the LiCor website.\nDecant the secondary antibody solution and wash the membrane 2 × 10 min each with 15 mL TBST, and 1 × 15 min with 15 mL TBS.\nRe-image membrane using the same imaging parameters (see step 22)."
