    "1. Preparation of Reagents and Solutions\nPrepare human cardiac myocytes (HCMs) complete medium by adding 25 mL of Myocyte Growth Medium supplement mix to 500 mL of Myocyte Growth Medium as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Store at 4 °C and warm to 37 °C before using.\nPrepare Tongxinluo (TXL) Solution by dissolving TXL ultrafine powder in serum/glucose-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) and adjust the concentration of TXL to 400 µg/mL by adding DMEM (for more details, see11). Store at 4 °C and warm to 37 °C before using.\nPrepare 5 mL of JC-1 working solution by adding 25 µL of JC-1 stock solution (200x), 4 mL of ultrapure water, and 1 mL of stock staining buffer (5x) in a 15 mL centrifuge tube in the dark. Pipette the mixture up and down several times and warm to 37 °C before using.\nPrepare 30 mL of working staining buffer by adding 24 mL of ultrapure water to 6 mL of stock staining buffer (5x) in a 50 mL centrifuge tube. Use this solution ice-cold.\n2. Establishment of Hypoxia/Reoxygenation Model\nPlate 1.0 x 105 cells per well with HCM complete medium in a 6 well plate. Grow to reach a confluency of about 70% in a cell incubator containing 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C.\nWash HCMs with phosphate buffer saline (PBS). Expose them to different treatments (400 µg/mL TXL or not) in 2 mL of serum/glucose-free DMEM for 30 min prior to hypoxia in a cell incubator containing 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C.",
    "Incubate HCMs in an airtight and hypoxic jar (2.5 L) fitted with a catalyst to scavenge free oxygen and induce hypoxia for 18 h (Figure 1A), and an anaerobic indicator to measure the oxygen tension in the medium11,12,13, in a cell incubator containing 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C.\n\tNote: It takes about 1.5 h for the catalyst to scavenge free oxygen in the jar. Therefore, the HCMs are kept in the jar for 19.5 h before the jar is opened. The color of anaerobic indicator changes from light blue in normoxic environment to pale white in hypoxic condition (Figure 1B).\nReoxygenate HCMs by moving the 6 well plate into an incubator set at 37 °C containing 5% CO2 and 95% air for 2 h.\n3. Preparation of HCMs for Flow Cytometry\nWarm the 0.25% trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution and PBS to 37 °C.\nAspirate medium from each well, rinse the cells with 1 mL of PBS and add 0.5 mL of 0.25% trypsin along the wall of the well.\nIncubate at 37 °C until all HCMs are almost detached (about 1 min).\nAdd 1 mL of DMEM complete medium (DMEM medium with 10% fetal bovine serum) to the wells to neutralize the trypsin. Transfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL centrifuge tube and pellet HCMs by centrifuging at 500 x g for 3 min at room temperature.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.\nAdd 0.5 mL of HCM complete medium and 0.5 mL of JC-1 working solution to each tube. Resuspend the HCMs by pipetting up and down.\nCover the whole tubes with aluminum foil to prevent bleaching of the fluorescent indicator and incubate HCMs in normal conditions (at 37 °C containing 5% CO2 and 95% air) for 20 min.",
    "Pellet HCMs by centrifuging at 500 x g for 3 min at 4 °C.\nRinse HCMs twice with 2 mL of ice-cold JC-1 staining buffer.\nResuspend HCMs in a final volume of 300 µL of ice-cold staining buffer in the sample tube (12 mm x 75 mm) and use the cells for analysis within 30 min.\n\tNote: Use carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), a potent inhibitor of respiratory electron transport chain, to treat HCMs for 1 h at a concentration of 20 µM, for the positive control.\n4. Flow Cytometer Setup\nStart the flow cytometer and ensure that the software is connected to it.\nPerform fluidics startup, start the stream and set up the breakoff.\nOpen two dot plot windows in the flow cytometry software.\n\t\nSelect forward scattered light (FSC) on the X axis and side scattered light (SSC) on the Y axis in the first dot plot to represent the characteristics of the cells in terms of their size and their granularity, respectively.\nSelect the PE (575 ± 26 nm) detection channel for the Y axis and FITC (530 ± 30 nm) for the X axis using a logarithmic scale in the second dot plot, which is used to measure the fluorescence intensity of JC-1 dye in the cells.\n5. Flow Cytometry Measurement and Data Analysis\nClick Unload to let out the tube support arm and position the Blank (HCMs that have not been dyed with JC-1) sample tube on it. Click Load to return the tube support arm to its working position.\nClick Record to collect particles from suspension in the Blank sample tube and then gate the cell population (P1) for further analysis in the first dot plot (Figure 3).",
    "Collect HCMs in other sample tubes and optimize the measurement by adjusting the voltages of fluorescence channels, to make sure that the cell dot is located in the central area of the second dot plot.\nDisplay the statistics of each sample tube and calculate the MMPs of each sample by dividing the ratio of red fluorescence intensity by that of green fluorescence intensity.\nSubscription Required.
