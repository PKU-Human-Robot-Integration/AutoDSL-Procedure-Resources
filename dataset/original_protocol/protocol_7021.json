    "Total RNA isolation and preparation for reverse transcriptionPrepare the cultures of two S. elongatus strains (PCC 7942 WT and Syn02) in 50 ml of BG-11 medium inside 250-ml glass flasks capped with sponges. Incubate in the controlled environment chamber (Percival) under the desired selected CO2 concentration at 30°C, slowly agitating under 80 µmol·m-2·s-1 illumination.Note: Culture time depends on the growth phase at which RuBisCO expression needs to be measured. Here, we collected cells at the early exponential phase. Once the cultures reach the desired OD750 value that indicates the anticipated growth phase, harvest the cells. Note: To normalize the cyanobacteria number and isolated RNA yield, we harvest 6 ml of cultures diluted to ~OD750 = 1.0.  Centrifuge the collected cultures at 4,700 × g for 10 min.Note: Because the mRNA turnover is very rapid, we recommend pouring the cells directly over ice in a Falcon tube and centrifuging at 4°C. In certain cases, using a stop solution prior to harvesting the cells is also recommended (95% ethanol, 5% phenol – 1/5 of the total volume). Decant the supernatant and resuspend the pelleted bacteria in 2 ml of TE buffer.Extract RNA by using the RNeasy Protect Bacteria Mini Kit, following the RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent Handbook – Protocol 4: Enzymatic Lysis and Proteinase K Digestion of Bacteria, with several adjustments to ensure the high yield of isolated RNA, as specified below:Mix 4 ml of RNA Protect Bacteria Reagent and 2 ml of the cell suspension (prepared in Step A4) in a 15-ml conical tube.Centrifuge at 4,700 × g for 10 min at room temperature.Decant the supernatant and re-centrifuge the pellet at 4,700 × g for 2 min at room temperature to discard the residual supernatant with a pipette tip.",
    "Note: Pellets can be frozen at -80°C to proceed on another day if necessary. Add 200 µl of TE buffer containing 15 mg/ml lysozyme and 100 µg/ml proteinase K and resuspend the pellet by pipetting up and down.Note: Inclusion of lysozyme in TE buffer is sufficient to lyse cyanobacterial cells, but addition of proteinase K enables extraction of higher amounts of total RNA. Mix by vortexing for 10 s and incubate cells resuspended in TE Lysis Buffer for 10 to 20 min at room temperature while constantly rocking the suspension on a shaker.Notes:  We extended the incubation time from the original RNeasy Protect Bacteria Mini Kit protocol to ensure that the rigid cyanobacterial cell walls are sufficiently disintegrated. After eluting the total RNA, measure its concentration using a NanoDrop and store RNA samples at -80°C or proceed immediately to DNase I treatment (next step). Alternatively, use a Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen) instead of a NanoDrop to measure RNA concentration. Qubit is recommended for the precise quantification of nucleic acids, but it is not utilized in this protocol. Add 700 µl of RLT buffer (supplemented with 10 µl β-mercaptoethanol per 1 ml of RLT buffer) and vortex vigorously for a few seconds.Add 500 µl of 96% ethanol (molecular grade) and mix by pipetting up and down (do not centrifuge).Transfer 700 µl of the lysate to an RNeasy Mini Spin Column placed in a 2 ml collection tube and centrifuge for 15 s at 10,000 × g at room temperature.Discard the flow-through, add the remaining lysate, and centrifuge as in the previous step.Add 700 µl of buffer RW1, centrifuge at 10,000 × g for 15 s at room temperature to wash the membrane, and discard the flow-through.",
    "Add 500 µl of buffer RPE (prepared by adding 44 ml of 100% ethanol to 11 ml of the RPE concentrate from the kit), centrifuge at 10,000 × g for 15 s at room temperature to wash the membrane, and discard the flow-through.Add another 500 µl of buffer RPE and centrifuge at 10,000 × g for 2 min at room temperature.Place the RNeasy Mini spin column in a new 2 ml collection tube and centrifuge at full speed (17,000 × g) for 1 min at room temperature.Place the spin column in a new 1.5 ml collection tube, add 40 µl of RNase-free water directly to the center of the membrane, and centrifuge at 17,000 × g for 1 min at room temperature to elute the total RNA.Measure RNA concentration in the eluates using a NanoDrop.Store the RNA samples at -80°C or proceed immediately to DNase I treatment (next step).Place the RNA samples on ice and prepare the reactions containing amplification grade DNase I according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer, with a few substantial adjustments to increase the purity of isolated RNA:Use 4 U of DNase I (4 µl) instead of 1 U (1 µl).Note: The additional amount of DNase I should help to completely eliminate the residual gDNA. Increase the total reaction volume to 20 µl. After adding 1 µg of RNA and 2 µl of 10× DNase I Reaction Buffer, add RNase-free water if necessary.Note: Provide a sufficient volume of each RNA sample to be used in reverse transcription (in both the positive reaction and the negative control; Step B2). Extend the incubation time from the recommended 15 min to 60 min at room temperature.Note: This is another step (besides the increased amount of DNase I) to ensure the complete elimination of gDNA.",
    "We did not observe any substantial adverse effects from increased DNase I concentration and incubation time on the quality (stability) of RNA. Add 2 µl of 25 mM EDTA to each reaction to inactivate DNase I prior to incubation at 65°C for 10 min.Measure RNA concentration in the DNase I-treated samples using a NanoDrop or Qubit fluorometer (we also recommend running the RNA on a gel to ensure it is not degraded). Store the samples at -80°C or proceed immediately to reverse transcription.Note: We usually obtain a final concentration of 50-100 ng/ml. Reverse transcription and qPCRUse SuperScriptTM IV First-Strand Synthesis System to perform reverse transcription (RT) of RNA samples. Prepare reactions to anneal primers to template RNA according to the instructions provided in the kit. Per reaction, use:1 µl of 50 µM random hexamers1 µl of 10 mM dNTP mix1 µl of DEPC-treated water10 µl of RNA samplePrepare two identical reactions as described in Step B1 for each RNA sample. One reaction will be positive (reverse transcriptase will be added to obtain cDNA for qPCR analysis), and another reaction will be negative (reverse transcriptase will not be added; thus, only RNA should remain in the sample). Heat the reactions at 65°C for 5 min and then incubate on ice for at least 1 min.Prepare the reverse transcription (RT) master mix for all the RNA-primer samples obtained in Step B2. Per sample, use:4 µl of 5× SSIV Buffer1 µl of 100 mM DTT1 µl of RNase InhibitorAliquot the RT master mix into the tubes containing the RNA-primer samples prepared in Step B2; transfer 6 µl of the mix to each RNA-primer sample.Add 1 µl of SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase from the kit to each RT positive reaction prepared in Step B2 (total reaction volume will be 20 µl).",
    "Add 1 µl of DEPC-treated water to each negative control prepared in Step B2 (total reaction volume will be 20 µl).Incubate all the reactions sequentially:At room temperature for 10 min.At 50-55°C for 10 min.At 80°C for 10 min.Store the reactions at -80°C or proceed immediately to Step B8.Check the quality of the cDNA templates generated in Step B7 by PCR (Tables 1 and 2). Use the primers (Table 4) that will also be used in subsequent qPCR. They should enable the generation of the products of expected sizes in positive reactions. Assess the purity of cDNA templates. There should be no PCR products generated from negative controls. Otherwise, cDNA templates might be contaminated with gDNA.Table 1.

The total volume of each master mix should be sufficient to test the expression of the desired number of genes for each individual qPCR sample in triplicate (Table 3).Note: We prepared two qPCR master mixes (for each WT and Syn02 strain), which were sufficient for 6 reactions as we analyzed the expression of two genes in three technical replicates: rbcL and secA; Table 4).Table 3.

    "Total protein extraction under denaturing conditionsPrepare the cultures of two S. elongatus strains (PCC 7942 WT and Syn02) in 50 ml of BG-11 medium inside of 250-ml glass flasks capped with sponges. Incubate in the controlled environment chamber (Percival) under the desired CO2 concentration at 30°C, agitation at 120 rpm, and illumination of 80 µmol·m-2·s-1.Note: Depends on the growth phase at which RuBisCO expression needs to be measured. Here, we collected cells at the early exponential phase. When the cultures reach the desired OD750 values, harvest the culture (normalization is important to ensure that similar amounts of cyanobacteria are processed in each sample to yield similar concentrations of extracted total protein; we used OD750 = ~1.0).Centrifuge the collected cultures at 4,700 × g for 10 min at room temperature.Decant the supernatant and re-centrifuge the pellet at 4,700 × g for 2 min at room temperature to discard the residual medium with a pipette tip.Preheat the Denaturing Lysis Buffer to 95°C in a heat block.Boil deionized water in a 250-ml beaker using a microwave.Add 500 µl of the hot Denaturing Lysis Buffer to the bacterial pellet. Immediately submerge the tube with the pellet in boiled deionized water and resuspend cyanobacterial cells by vigorously pipetting them up and down several times.Transfer the cell suspension to a new 1.5 ml tube and heat at 95°C for 10 min. Briefly vortex the tube midway through the incubation time.Sonicate the obtained lysate 3 × 10 s, with 10-s intervals, and at 40% amplitude (no incubation on ice is needed).Centrifuge the lysate at 17,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature and transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 ml tube.Measure total protein concentration in the cleared lysate by using the PierceTM BCA Protein Assay Kit.Store the lysates at -80°C until proceeding to SDS-PAGE.",
    "Total protein separation by SDS-PAGE and immunodetection by Western blotMix the prepared cyanobacterial cell lysates with the Laemmli Sample Buffer to obtain samples containing 5 µg of total protein.Note: Total protein amount to be used in SDS-PAGE depends on the expected RuBisCO signal intensity to be obtained by Western blot. We recommend preparing a calibration curve with RuBisCO signal intensity plotted as a function of total protein amount. This will allow estimation of the optimal range of total protein amount at which the signal intensity for RuBisCO correlates with the total protein level. Load the samples prepared in step 1 onto the 6% (v/v) polyacrylamide stacking gel assembled in the Mini-PROTEAN® Tetra Vertical Electrophoresis Cell system in TGS buffer.Run electrophoresis at 100-150 V until the samples migrate through the 12% (v/v) polyacrylamide resolving gel.Transfer total protein resolved in the gel onto a nitrocellulose membrane in Transfer Buffer using the Mini Trans-Blot Electrophoretic Transfer Cell system at 90 mA (constant) for 16 h at 4°C.Note: Alternatively, transfer at 400 mA (constant) for 1 h at 4°C. The advantage of a longer transfer is that it does not generate as much heat as a 1-h transfer, which might result in better-resolved bands. Optional: dry the membrane containing transferred proteins for approximately 20 min at room temperature.Note: This step may increase protein immobilization in the membrane, potentially resulting in clearer bands of target proteins during immunodetection (background signal may also be increased). Rinse the membrane briefly in deionized water.Pour 3-5 ml of RevertTM 700 Total Protein Stain over the membrane to cover it evenly and incubate for 5 min at room temperature with gentle agitation until clear bands of total protein stain become visible.",
    "Wash out the excess stain from the membrane with 3-5 ml of Wash Solution for 30 s at room temperature with gentle agitation.Rinse the washed membrane briefly in deionized water and acquire an image with the Odyssey® Fc Imaging System at 700 nm. The documented signal represents the total protein stain to normalize RuBisCO protein quantity.Note: To our knowledge, no particular cyanobacterial protein is used as a universal reference (loading control) in Western analyses. Therefore, the analysis of protein expression in cyanobacteria usually involves normalization to total protein stain. Rinse the membrane in deionized water.Block the membrane by incubation in 5% (w/v) non-fat milk in TBS for 1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation.Note: The incubation time can be shorted by 30 min if needed. Incubate the membrane in the antibody solution containing rabbit anti-RbcL antibody diluted 1:5,000 in TBST with 5% (w/v) non-fat milk and 0.03% (w/v) sodium azide, overnight at 4°C with gentle agitation.Notes: Alternatively, incubate the membrane in the antibody solution for 1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. We do not recommend reusing the same antibody solution on another day (either after overnight or 1-h incubation). Discard the antibody solution and wash the membrane briefly in TBST, followed by 1 × 15 min and 3 × 5 min washes in TBST at room temperature with gentle agitation.Incubate the membrane in IRDye® 800CW goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody diluted 1:20,000 in Intercept® (TBS) blocking buffer supplemented with 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20, for 1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation, protected from light.Discard the secondary antibody solution and wash the membrane briefly in TBST, followed by 1 × 15 min and 3 × 5 min washes in TBST at room temperature with gentle agitation.",
    "Rinse the membrane in deionized water and acquire images with the Odyssey® Fc Imaging System at 700 nm (to visualize protein mass standards) and 800 nm (to obtain the signal for RuBisCO large subunit, RbcL, with the expected band size of ~55 kDa).Note: An example of immunodetected RbcL is shown in Garcia et al., 2021. Perform the densitometric analysis of the obtained protein bands using appropriate software, such as Image Studio (LI-COR) or Quantity One (Bio-Rad). Normalize the RbcL signal to a corresponding total protein stain signal (acquired in Step D9). Compare the normalized RbcL signal intensity for each Syn02 strain replicate culture with the averaged normalized RbcL signal intensity across all WT replicate cultures. RbcL expression level in the Syn02 strain can be expressed WT expression level fold change.Determination of photosynthetic oxygen evolution ratePrepare the cultures of two S. elongatus strains (PCC 7942 WT and Syn02) in 50 ml of BG-11 medium inside of 250-ml glass flasks capped with sponges. Incubate in the controlled environment chamber (Percival) under desired CO2 concentration at 30°C, 120 × g (we used ambient air), and illumination of 80 µmol·m-2·s-1.Note: Depends on the growth phase at which RuBisCO expression needs to be measured. Here, we collected cells at the early exponential phase. Once the cultures reached an OD750 value indicating an anticipated growth phase, harvest the cells.Note: To normalize the number of cyanobacteria being analyzed in the reaction chamber of Oxygraph+ System, we harvest the same amount of bacterial culture as in Section A. Centrifuge the collected cultures at 5,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature.Decant the supernatant and resuspend cells in 1 ml of BG-11 medium.",
    "Meanwhile, assemble the Oxygraph+ System consisting of the Clark-type oxygen electrode mounted in the electrode disc, the oxygen electrode chamber, and the Oxygraph+ electrode control unit operated from the computer. Follow the steps according to the manual provided by the manufacturer (Oxygraph+ System Manual, version 2.0, by Hansatech Instruments Ltd, 2017).Note: The manual contains detailed pictures that may aid in the proper assembly of the instrument as well. Calibrate the Oxygraph+ System using the liquid phase calibration process. Follow the steps in the manual provided by the manufacturer (Liquid Phase Calibration Guide, version 2, by Hansatech Instruments Ltd, 2017).Measure the OD750 values of cell suspensions prepared in Step E4.Wrap the cell suspensions in aluminum foil to protect them from light and incubate with gentle agitation for 15 min at room temperature.Note: Shortening the 15-min incubation may result in higher background oxygen level upon starting the measurement using oxygraph. It may also introduce higher fluctuation of recorded oxygen, which, in turn, may lead to an increased deviation between replicates. Add the bacterial suspension into the reaction vessel of the oxygen electrode chamber.Note: Total volume of the bacterial suspension must be 0.2-2.5 ml. We used 1 ml. Insert the gas-tight plunger assembly that prevents the diffusion of atmospheric oxygen into the reaction vessel.Turn on stirring (set stirrer speed to 100 by using the OxyTrace+ software).Turn on the source of light to illuminate the reaction vessel during the measurement. The distance of the source of light from the reaction vessel must remain constant during the experiment – production of oxygen strictly depends on the amount of available light. Use high light intensity.Start recording oxygen evolution with OxyTrace+ for up to 10 min (the signal might not start to steadily increase until a few minutes have passed).",
    "Calculate oxygen evolution rate (expressed as nanomoles of O2 generated per ml of bacterial suspension) over three consecutive minutes while the level of produced oxygen grows steadily without interruption (Table 8).Measure the concentration of chlorophyll a in the bacterial suspension according to the protocol by          Zavřel et al. (2015)          . Note: We calculated the concentration of chlorophyll a using the equation: Chla [µg/ml] = 12.9447 (A665 – A720).  Normalize oxygen evolution rates in cyanobacterial suspensions to their OD750 values measured in Step E7 and to chlorophyll a concentration measured in step 15 (Table 8). Note: Authors usually use one of the presented methods for normalization. The oxygen evolution rate normalized to OD750 is expressed as µM O2·min-1·OD750-1, and normalized to chlorophyll a – as nmol O2·h-1·µg chlorophyll a-1.  Table 8. Example oxygen evolution rates measured with Oxygraph+ System and normalized to OD750 and chlorophyll a content imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20211017/20211017210923_4925.png Rinse the reaction vessel thoroughly with deionized water before starting the oxygen evolution rate measurement for another sample. Perform the analysis for each strain in three biological replicates."
