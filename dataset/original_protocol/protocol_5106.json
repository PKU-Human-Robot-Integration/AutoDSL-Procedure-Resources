    "Preparation of antibody-immobilized protein A or protein G agarose beads.Day 1The following components in DEPEC treated water are final concentrations.50 mM Tris (pH 7.5)50 mM NaCl1 mM MgCl20.05% Nonidet P40Wash beads with NT2 buffer. If you have 4 samples, you need to take 100 μl beads to each Eppendorf tube, total 4 tubes. 3,600 rpm 1 min at 4 °C, remove supernatant. Wash 3 times with 200 μl NT2 buffer.Add 30 μg target antibody (such as HuR 1 μg/μl from NBL) to each tube.Add 320 μl NT2 buffer to each tube. Overnight rotate at 4 °C.Day 2Centrifuge the tubes (Ab+ beads) 5,000 x g 5 min at 4 °C. Discard supernatant wash twice with freshly made NT2 buffer 1 ml. After last wash, temporarily keep supernatant and put on ice until cell lysate is ready.Lysis of mammalian cellsPrepare cell pellet:Detach the cells from the culture dish by pipetting or using a cell scraper, if necessary. Collect the cell suspension into centrifuge tube. Centrifuge the cell suspension at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet the cells. Carefully remove and discard the supernatant. Wash the cells by resuspending the cell pellet with ice-cold PBS. Centrifuge the cell suspension at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet the cells. Carefully remove and discard the supernatant. Wash the cells once again using steps 3-4.Wash the cells by resuspending the cell pellet with ice-cold nuclease-free PBS. Centrifuge the cell suspension at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet the cells. Carefully remove and discard the supernatant.Wash the cells by resuspending the cell pellet with ice-cold nuclease-free PBS.Aliquot the cell suspension to each new microcentrifuge tube.",
    "Centrifuge the cell suspension at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet the cells. Carefully remove and discard the supernatant.Lysis cell pelletMake RSB buffer in DEPEC treated water with final following concentrations.10 mM Tris (pH 7.5)100 mM NaCl2.5 mM MgCl2Then add other supplements in per ml RSB buffer. 10 μl digitornin/ml buffer (Digitornin is dissolved in ethanol 4 mg/ml freshly), 3 μl RNase inhibitor/ml buffer, 40 μl proteinase inhibitor cocktail/ml. Add 200 μl of RSB buffer to each cell pellet. On ice 2 min. Centrifuge 4,400 rpm 4  °C, 8 min. Make 753 μl master mix for each tube (Ab + beads). For 4 tubes, you can make 4.5 times more.700 μl NT2 buffer10 μl 0.1 M DTT10 μl RNase inhibitor33 μl 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8)Then add each supernatant of cell lysate to tube (Ab+ beads). Rotate at 4 °C 2 h.Take 20 μl for western blot from the mixture. The centrifuge the tube at 5,000 x g 4 °C 2 min.Discard supernatant. Wash pellet with 1 ml NT2 buffer twice at 5,000 x g 4 °C 2 min.Further process the mixture to get mRNAs. Make DNAase master mix.Now we have 4 tubes, so make 4.5 times master mix.100 μl of NT2 buffer x 4.5=450 μl5 μl of DNAase (2U/μl) x 4.5=22.5 μlAdd 105 μl of DNAase master mix to each tube and 37 °C, 10 min incubation.Then add 1ml NT2 buffer centrifuge 5,000 x g 5 min 4 °C. Remove supernatant.Add proteinase K (20 mg/μl) master mix 103 μl to each tube. 55 °C, 15 min plus mixing.Master mix: 2.5 μl proteinase K x 4.5=11.25 μl0.5 μl 20% SDS x 4.5=2.25 μl100 μl NT2 buffer x 4.5=450 μlCentrifuge 5,000 x g 4 °C 5 min.Collect 100 μl supernatant to a new Eppendorf tube.",
    "Add 200 μl of NT2 buffer to old tube, centrifuge 5,000 x g 4 °C, 5 min again. Collect 200 μl of supernatant and pool to the new tube, which becomes 300 μl of supernatant.Add equal volume of acid phenol/chloroform to above supernatant.Vertex 1 min, then centrifuge 1 min RT, 13k rpm.Collect about 250 μl of aqueous phase (top phase)Add: 25 μl of 3 M NaoAc (pH 5.5)625 μl of 100% ethanol3 μl of glycogen blueMix well and put it at -20 °C or below for 20 min (or for overnight, if necessary).Centrifuge the tube at 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C, then aspirate the supernatant carefully.Rinse with 1 ml 70% Ethanol, 13,000 x g 2 min at 4 °C. Discard supernatant. Invert the tube, air dry 5 min. The pellet is mRNAs."
