    "The following procedure measures hypoxia in tumor-bearing mice and can be used at any respective end point of an animal experiment.The HypoxyprobeTM (pimonidazole hydrochloride) is resuspended at a concentration of 30 mg/ml in 0.9% sterile saline.Multiple mice (n = 5 per group is optimal for statistical relevance) are injected intravenously (tail vein) with 60 mg/kg of the pimonidazole solution. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20141005/20141005044833_4932.jpgFigure 1. Tail Vein Injection protocol. 1. Obtain a Tailveiner Restrainer. 2. Insert mouse and push the restrainer to set the mouse in position. 3. Rotate the tail 45 degrees in order to find and inject the tail vein with the needle. 4. Close representation of the tail vein injection. 5. The appearance of blood validates a successful tail vein injection. Let circulate in vivo for 90 min before the mice are euthanazied with isoflurane or carbon dioxide (CO2). Note: For animal euthanasia: In compliance with proper IACUC protocols, animals are placed in a drop jar or vaporizer in the presence of controlled concentrations of isoflurane or CO2 in order to ensure proper inhalation. Animals are then sacrificed by a secondary method with cervical dislocation. Organs are then removed, weighed, snap-frozen, and stored in plastic scintillation vials at -80 °C.Note: The pimonidazole stain can work on paraffin-embedded tissue, frozen tissue, and cell lines. Organs are then taken out of the scintillation vials, embedded in OCT, placed in a cryostat, and cut into 10 µm-thick sections. Sections are placed on microscope slides for staining. Notes: Cryostat settings Temperature used can range from -10 to -50 °C depending on tissue type, though -20 °C is recommended for the majority of tissues. Alternate between “Trimming mode” (cuts 5 - 150 µm) and “Sectioning mode” (0.5 - 50 µm) in order to adjust the tissue for the beginning of section collection.",
    "The speed of sectioning is dependent of the researcher’s own speed. As many sections as necessary can be cut per organ used.To achieve a proper representation of the sample, cut non-serial sections of the tissue. Frozen tissue sections are then interrogated with FITC-conjugated anti-pimonidazole primary antibody (included in kit) and endothelial cell markers (CD31, Meca-32, or endomucin) followed by respective Cy3-conjugated secondary IgG. Use a slide incubated with only antibody diluent as its primary antibody as a negative control.The Hypoxyprobe™-1 Plus Kit recommends a 1:50 - 100 dilution of the secondary rabbit anti-FITC horseradish peroxidase conjugated antibody. For other primary antibodies a 1:50 - 1:100 dilution is recommended, unless otherwise specified by respective primary antibody data sheets.Notes: Any suitably labeled, secondary anti-FITC antibody can be used which would bind to the pimonidazole adducts in hypoxic cells within the tissues. This staining should be done within a week of harvesting the organs as the signal will begin to fade. The interrogation of hypoxia within animal tissues is not limited to fluorescent staining as it can be done with brown stain (DAB) as well. Respective primary and secondary antibodies can be utilized to achieve both types of staining. Example of a fluorescent tissue-staining protocol for frozen sections:Air dry frozen slides.Fix the slides with Acetone for 30 sec - 2 min.Briefly air dry sections a few seconds (do not let tissue dry completely).Rehydrate sections with PBS-t 2 times, 5 min each.Note: Once the tissue is rehydrated, do not let the slides dry out.Block in your favorite blocking solution (typically 20% aqua block in PBS) 10 - 30 min.Pour off the blocking solution, add primary antibody and incubate 1 h at room temperature-overnight at 4 °C.Wash the slides with PBS-t 3 times, 5 min each.",
    "Incubate the slides with secondary antibody 1 h at room temperature.Wash with PBS-t 4 times, 5 min each.Mount the slides with prolong gold mounting solution and coverslip.Apply sealant (e.g. clear nail polish) along the edges of the coverslips to preserve the slides.Image the slides.Imaging of tissue sections should then be obtained with 20x or 40x microscopic magnification as desired and analyzed using NIS Elements software or ImageJ (open source software). Notes: The filters on the microscope should include the following wavelengths for fluorescent microscopy: FITC (green 470-520 nm) Cy3/TRITC (red 530-570 nm)DAPI/nuclei (blue 345-455 nm) Six to eight images per tissue area are recommended in order to capture the variable signal intensity in a wide representative sample of the respective tissue. The negative control slide from step 6 should be used as a background control. With the image analysis software, once the threshold of “background” is calculated use this threshold to image the remaining sections and ultimately normalize them to this threshold to eliminate the background."
