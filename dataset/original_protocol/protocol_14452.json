    "The protocol follows the animal care guidelines of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine and is approved by the animal experiment Shanghai Animal Ethics Committee.\n1. Protocol I: Preparation of EXD\nCalculation\nAdminister the EXD to a treatment group of 10 Six month-old female Imprinting Control Region (ICR) mice (0.02 kg/mouse), 5 days per week for 12 weeks.\n\t\tNOTE: A total of 1.702 EXDs are needed. Because EXDs are measured in discrete increments, in real practice, administer 2 EXDs.\nCalculate the volume of EXD applied per mouse (i.e. V = (0.1418 EXD/kg•day) * (0.02 kg/mouse) * 50 mL/EXD = 0.14 mL/mouse•day).\nSoaking\nPut all the raw materials of two EXDs (ie., Curculigo orchioides Gaertn (18 g), Herbaa Epimedii (18 g), Radix Morindae Officinalis (18 g), Radix Angelicae Sinensis (18 g), Cortex Phellodendri (12 g), and Rhizoma Anemarrhenae (12 g), 96 g in total) into a container with a lid.\n\t\tNOTE: A ceramic container is recommended.\nMacerate the raw herbs with 500 mL of distilled water for 1 h; the water should cover the herbs by about an inch. Let all the herbs thoroughly soak.\nFirst water decoction\nHeat the herbs using a gas cooker or an induction cooker on high power until the water boils (about 5 - 10 min; the time span depends on the heating power, the container, and the quantity of herbs and water). Turn down the power to a low simmer for 2 h.\nFirst filtration\nCover a 500-mL glass beaker with regular filter paper or with gauze and cotton. Carefully pour off the decoction into the beaker through the filter. Leave the herbs in the container.\nReturn the remaining herbal residue on the filter paper to the container.\nSecond water decoction",
    "Add distilled water to the container with the herbs; let it cover the herbs by about an inch.\nRepeat step 1.3.\nSecond filtration\nRepeat steps 1.4.1 and 1.4.2.\nPour off the second decoction into the same beaker. Mix the first and second decoctions together.\nConcentration\nPut the beaker onto a gas cooker with asbestos-free wire gauze between them, heat the decoction using a low simmer, and slowly and continuously stir with a glass rod.\nWhen the decoction reduces to 200 mL, transfer it to a 500-mL beaker.\nRepeat step 1.7.1 until the decoction reduces to 100 mL.\nStorage and administration\nTransfer the concentrated decoction to a sterile glass bottle. Let it cool to room temperature (RT). Store at 4 °C if using within one week or at -70 °C for long-term storage.\nUsing a gavage needle, administer 0.14 mL/mouse of the decoction to ovariectomized (OVX) mice once per day, 5 days a week for 12 weeks.\n2. Protocol II: Preparation of EXD-containing Serum\nCalculation\nCalculate the rat-equivalent dose (RED) using 0.15 kg as the body weight of each rat (1 month old): dB = (1/60) * (90/100) * (60/0.15)1/3 = 0.111 EXD/kg/day.\n\t\tNOTE: A total of 10 mL of EXD-containing serum is needed to prepare 100 mL of culture medium (10% EXD-containing serum). Each rat is expected to provide 2 mL of serum. Thus, 6 rats (a 20% loss is taken into account) are needed for EXD administration once a day for 3 days. The number of EXDs is: (0.111 EXD/kg•day) * (0.15 kg/rat) * (6 rats) * (3 days) = 0.300 EXD. Again, because EXDs are measured in discrete increments, use 1 EXD.\nCalculate the volume of EXD applied per rat (i.e., V = (0.111 EXD/kg•day) * (0.15 kg/rat) * (50 mL/EXD) = 0.83 mL/rat•day).\nSoaking",
    "Put the raw materials for 1 EXD into a container with a lid. Macerate the raw herbs in distilled water for 1 h; the water should cover the herbs by about an inch. Let all the herbs thoroughly soak.\nFirst water decoction\nHeat the herbs using an induction cooker on high power until the water boils (about 5 - 10 min; the time span depends on the heat power, the container, and the quantity of herbs and water). Turn the power down to a low simmer for 2 h.\nFirst filtration\nCover a 500-mL glass beaker with regular filter paper or with gauze and cotton. Carefully pour off the decoction into the beaker through the filter. Leave the herbs in the container.\nReturn the herbal residue on the filter paper to the container.\nSecond water decoction\nAdd distilled water to the container with the herbs; let it cover the herbs by about an inch.\nRepeat step 2.4.\nSecond filtration\nRepeat steps 2.5.1 and 2.5.2.\nPour off the second decoction into the same beaker as in step 2.4.1 and mix the first and second decoctions together.\nConcentration\nPut the beaker on a gas cooker with asbestos-free wire gauze between them, heat the decoction using a low simmer, and slowly and continuously stir with a glass rod.\nWhen the decoction reduces to 100 mL, transfer it to a 100-mL beaker.\nRepeat step 2.7.1 until the decoction reduces to 50 mL.\nStorage and administration\nTransfer the concentrated decoction into a sterile glass bottle. Let it cool to RT. Store at 4 °C if using within one week or at -70 °C for long-term storage.\nIntragastrically administer 0.83 mL/rat once per day for 3 days.\nEXD-containing serum preparation",
    "Anesthetize the rats by intraperitoneally injecting of 300 mL/100 g of 80 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine  at 1 h after the last administration of EXD. Confirm proper anesthetization by toe pinch.\nIncise the skin and peritoneum of the rat from the abdomen to the bottom of the thorax using a scalpel (or straight operating scissors). Create an incision of length and depth of about 5 cm and 0.5 cm, respectively. Move the abdominal viscera to the left using tissue paper.\nUsing tissue paper, remove the connective tissue of the abdominal aorta to clearly expose the vessel.\nDraw the blood slowly from the abdominal aorta using a 10-mL, 22-gauge syringe. Transfer it to a 15-mL sterile tube after removing the needle; one rat can produce 8-10 mL of blood.\n\t\tNOTE: The rat should be alive (i.e., with the abdominal aorta pulsating) when beginning the blood drawing and dead after the drawing completes.\nClot the blood in an upright position for 30 - 60 min at room RT. Centrifuge at 500-600 x g for 20 min. Carefully place all the supernatant (serum) in one 50-mL sterile tube and mix all the serum (from different animals) together.\nPerform heat inactivation by incubating the serum in a 56 °C water bath for 30 min. Filter the serum using a syringe filter with a 0.22-µm pore size hydrophilic polyethersulfone membrane. Use the serum fresh or store it at -20 °C.\nControl drug-containing serum preparation (used in the control group)\nAdminister each rat with the same volume of saline (0.83 mL) once per day for 3 days. The other steps are the same as in step 2.9.\nApplication\nAdd 10 mL of EXD-containing serum or drug-containing serum to each 100 mL of medium, plus 1% penicillin-streptomycin (PS)23.",
