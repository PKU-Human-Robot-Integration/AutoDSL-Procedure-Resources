    "All animal experiments performed in this work are approved by the Animal Ethics Committee at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\n1. Open-top UV-PAM system (Figure 1)\nOptical illumination\n\t\nUse a Q-switch diode-pumped solid-state laser (266 nm wavelength) as an excitation source.\nUse two convex lenses to expand the laser beam and place a pinhole close to the focal point of the first convex lens to perform spatial filtering.\nReflect the laser beam upward using a 1D galvanometer mirror (1D GM).\nUse an objective lens to focus the laser beam and pass through the center of a ring-shaped ultrasonic transducer (UT) before being tightly focused on a sample.\nUltrasonic detection\n\t\nUse a ring-shaped focused UT to detect ultrasonic waves. The inner and outer diameters of the UT active area are 3 mm and 6 mm, respectively. Focal length: 6.3 mm; center frequency: 40 MHz; -6 dB bandwidth: 84%.\nFix the UT into a lab-made water tank with an optically transparent window at the bottom, covered by a thin quartz coverslip to allow UV light to pass through. Ensure that the active area of the UT is facing upward. Attach the water tank to a two-axis manual stage for controlling the lateral position of the UT.\nTurn on the UV laser, adjust the position of the UT to allow the laser beam to pass through from the center of the UT. Turn off the UV laser. Then, fill the water tank with deionized water to fully immerse the UT.\nConnect the output of the UT to two amplifiers (total gain = 56 dB) and connect the output of the second amplifier to a data acquisition card (DAQ).",
    "Attach a sample holder to a z-axis manual stage which is connected to xy-motorized stages. The sample holder has an empty hole that allows UV light to pass through. Attach four pieces of double-sided tape surrounding the hole.\nSystem alignment\n\t\nAttach black tape to a glass slide and place the glass slide to cover the hole of the sample holder, with the black tape facing downward. Press the glass slide to ensure that it is fixed on the sample holder. Then, lower the sample holder to immerse the glass slide into the water.\nDisconnect the ring-shaped UT and amplifiers, connect the UT to the pulser/receiver, and connect the output of the pulser/receiver to an oscilloscope. Operate the pulser/receiver into the Pulse-Echo mode. Set the pulse amplitude and the gain of the pulser/receiver to 6 and 20 dB, respectively.\n\t\t\nEnable the pulser/receiver and adjust the z-position of the sample holder to find the position of the acoustic focal plane where the ultrasonic signals are maximum.\nChange the pulser/receiver to the transmission mode and set the gain to 60 dB. Enable the laser output. Adjust the z-position of the objective lens to maximize the PA signals that are measured by the oscilloscope.\nAdjust the lateral position of the ring-shaped UT to make the generated PA signal symmetric and maximum, which represents that the optical and acoustic foci are coaligned in the lateral plane. Then, adjust the z-position of the sample holder to maximize the PA signals.\nRepeat steps 1.4.3 and 1.4.4 to optimize both the symmetry and amplitude of the PA signals. Record the time delay (i.e., the time it takes for the PA waves to reach the UT) on the oscilloscope when the PA signals are optimized.",
    "Move the sample holder to image different positions of the black tape. Adjust the sample holder's flatness such that the PA signals generated from each position of the black tape have the same time delay as the one measured in step 1.4.5.\nTurn off the laser and connect the UT to the two amplifiers.\n2. Sample preparation\nFFPE mouse brain slice\n\t\nSacrifice a mouse with an overdose of anesthesia. Then, harvest the mouse brain following the protocol described in reference18.\nFix the harvested brain in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 24 h.\nProcess the fixed brain by dehydration with graded alcohol, clearing with xylene, and embedding with paraffin as described in reference19.\n\t\tNOTE: Process the sample in a fume hood.\nSlice the embedded brain in thin slices (5 µm in thickness) using a microtome. Place the sample slices on quartz slides. Dry the slides in an oven at 60 °C for 1 h.\nDeparaffinize the sections using a clearing agent (see Table of Materials), which removes the paraffin to avoid high background signals as paraffin is highly absorbing with UV excitation.\n\t\tNOTE: Process the sample in a fume hood.\nFresh mouse brain slice\n\t\nSacrifice a mouse with an overdose of anesthesia. Then, harvest the mouse brain following the protocol stated in reference18.\nWash the mouse brain with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove the blood.\nCut a slice of the brain sample (~5 mm thick) by hand, and then wash the sample with PBS to remove the blood on the cross section.\n3. Experimental procedures\nSample placement",
    "Prepare a lab-made sample tank with a UV transparent membrane (polyethylene, ∼10 µm in thickness). Add a drop of water to the membrane and then place the biological sample on the sample tank to cover the water. In the case of the FFPE slice sample, use tape to fix the glass slide on the membrane.\nPlace the sample-containing sample tank on the sample holder, ensuring to cover the empty hole of the sample holder.\nSet the UV laser to the external-trigger mode. Using our lab-built LabVIEW program (see Table of Materials), set the scanning parameters as follows.\n\t\nSet the laser repetition rate to 55 kHz; set the signal type of the GM driver to triangular and the driving voltage range to 0.018 V (representing ±0.018 V; scale factor: 1 V/°). Set GMnum to 22 and dy to 2 so that after every 22 laser triggers, the GM finishes a quarter of the scanning period, and the y-axis motor moves a step size of 0.3125 µm. Set dx to 192 so that when the y-axis motor reaches the preset position (e.g., 5 mm), the x-axis motor moves a step size of 30 µm.\n\t\tNOTE: The smallest incremental step size is set to be 0.15625 µm for both the x- and y-axis motors. Therefore, when dy = 2, step size equals 0.15625 x 2 = 0.3125 µm, and when dx = 192, step size equals 0.15625 x 192 = 30 µm. To scan the entire area of 5 x 5 mm2, the x-axis motor will move 5000 µm /30 µm = 167 times, which means that 167 sub-images would be stitched to obtain a whole image. See Figure 2 for the scanning trajectory of the UV-PAM system.",
    "Start trial scanning on a small region by setting the number of moving steps of the x- and y-axis motors (xn = 10 and yn = 1000). Adjust the z-axis manual stage to place the sample on the focal plane for obtaining maximum PA signals.\nMove both x- and y-axis motors to the desired starting point, set the scanning region by setting the xn and yn values, and then start the image acquisition program (see Table of Materials).\nAfter the image acquisition, turn off the laser, remove the sample holder, and store the biological samples.\nFor fresh biological tissues, store the samples in 10% neutral buffered formalin.\nFor the FFPE mouse brain slices, stain with H&E following the protocol stated in reference20 to obtain the corresponding H&E-stained images.\nUse the collected PA signals to reconstruct the maximum amplitude projection image using a lab-built image processing algorithm (see Table of Materials)."
