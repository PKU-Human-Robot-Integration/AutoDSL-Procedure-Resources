  "procedures": [
    "Culture TRF2-HEK293T and control cells in 100 mm dishes with a standard medium (DMEM containing 10% FBS). Upon reaching 60-70% confluency, co-transfect the cells with plasmids Myc-REST4/HA-Ubiquitin using Calcium phosphate transfection kit following manufacturer’s instruction. 48 h after the transfection, treat the cells with 20 µM MG132 (protect from light) in the standard medium and incubate for 5 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Remove medium and wash cells with PBS, then lyse cells in a 100 mm dish with 600 µl of chilled HEPES lysis buffer (incubate on ice/4 °C for 4 min before scraping to increase protein yield).Collect cell lysate in an Eppendorf tube and pass lysate through 21G needle ~25 times to aid lysis and shred DNA.Add ubiquitin aldehyde to the lysate to a final concentration of 1 µM and mix sample on a rotator at 20 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Centrifuge the sample at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C to pellet cell debris and transfer the supernatant to a new tube.Pre-clear samples with 50 µl of protein G Dynabeads for 1 h at 4 °C with a rotator at 20 rpm to remove proteins that non-specifically stick to beads.Bind antibodies to beads for immunoprecipitation (IP): Vortex Dynabeads stock for >30 sec to re-suspend beads.Dispense 50 µl of beads per IP reaction.Place on magnet to separate beads from solution, aspirate out solution.Dilute 3 µg Myc antibody in 500 µl of binding buffer and do the same for normal mouse IgG control. Note: Since Myc antibody was raised from mouse, normal mouse IgG is used as negative control.Bind antibodies to the beads by incubating 30 min at room temperature and 30 min at 4 °C with shaking.",
    "Quantify the pre-cleared sample for protein concentration and prepare 1 mg protein per IP and 20 µg protein per input.After antibody-beads binding, place tube containing beads onto magnet and remove binding solution. Wash beads once with binding solution to remove any excess antibody.Transfer 1 mg of pre-cleared proteins into the beads that have been linked to Myc antibody or normal mouse IgG. Mix samples and incubate for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation at 20 rpm to perform IP. Following formation of the beads-antibody-antigen complex, place samples back onto magnet to remove the supernatant. Re-suspend beads in 400 µl lysis buffer and place back onto magnet, remove supernatant as before. Repeat step 13 two more times to wash beads of any unspecific binding.After final wash re-suspend beads-antibody-antigen complex in 100 µl lysis buffer and transfer to a clean tube.Place the samples in magnet and remove the supernatant. Re-suspend complex pellet in 40 µl 2x electrophoresis buffer, vortex harshly and pulse spin in microcentrifuge to collect all the solution to the bottom of the tube. Heat the above sample at 70 °C for 10 min with shaking in a thermomixer.Place the sample back onto magnet for a final time and transfer supernatant to a new tube (IP tube).Boil the IP samples and Input samples (20 µg of lysate directly from step 9 for each sample) at 95 °C for 5 min.Analyze the samples via Western blotting. Specificity and quality of IP: In order to verify the function of TRF2 on REST4 ubiquitination, it is necessary to ensure that similar amount of Myc-REST4 proteins are precipitated between TRF2 expressing and control cells and that this precipitation is specific. Therefore, IP samples are tested with anti-c-Myc (1:1,000) antibody as shown in Figure 1.",
    "Effect of TRF2 on REST4 ubiquitination: IP samples are also tested for ubiquitin binding with anti-HA (1:1,000 dilution) antibody as ubiquitin is tagged with HA epitope. To ensure the correct protein expression and loading, all cell lysates without immunoprecipitation (input samples) are tested with anti-c-Myc (1:1,000), anti-TRF2 (1:500) and anti-β-actin (1:5,000) antibodies."
