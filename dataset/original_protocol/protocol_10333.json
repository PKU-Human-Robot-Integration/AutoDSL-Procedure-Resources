    "1. Generating Virtual Masks\nNOTE: A 3D image stack of mouse brain microvasculature was chosen as the microfluidic model for this protocol, having been culled from a much larger dataset containing images of an entire mouse brain microvasculature. Microvascular images were acquired via knife-edged scanning microscopy (KESM)26,2; similar microvascular data are openly available through the KESM Mouse Brain Atlas28.\nOpen the image processing software29 and open and crop the 3D TIF image stack of native vasculature so that the desired microfluidic network, to be generated within the hydrogel, fits in a 450 µm x 450 µm x 1.5 mm (x by y by z) window. To do so, draw a square around the desired region and click \"Image\" → \"Crop\". Remove the slices in the z-direction by clicking \"Image\" → \"Duplicate\" and type in a desired slice range.\n\tNOTE: This ensures that the desired features fit within the field of view (x by y) (531.2 x 531.2 µm when using a 20X (NA1.0) water immersion objective with a frame size of 2,884 x 2,884 pixels and a zoom of 0.8 with a laser-scanning confocal microscope) and the working distance (z) of a 20X (NA1.0) water immersion objective. If unknown, the field of view for other systems can be determined by acquiring an image with the desired objective and settings.\nRotate the image stack so that the features are primarily aligned with the direction of raster scanning, or the x-direction, by clicking \"Image\" → \"Transform\" → \"Rotate\". This decreases the time needed for fabrication.",
    "Scale the cropped image stack so that the pixel size matches or exceeds the settings used for degradation on the confocal microscope (0.184 µm/pixel when using a 20X (NA1.0) water immersion objective with a frame size of 2,884 by 2,884 pixels and a zoom of 0.8). To do this, click \"Image\" → \"Adjust\" → \"Size\" and type in \"2446\" for \"Width\" (i.e., 450 µm, or the size of the image divided by 0.184 µm/pixel).\nThreshold/binarize the image stack by typing \"Ctrl + Shift + T\". Deselect \"Dark Background\", and click \"apply\" → \"ok\". Finish the process by clicking \"Image\" → \"Lookup Tables\" → \"Invert LUT\".\nUsing a custom algorithm (source code is available in the supplemental material of the referenced manuscript) in the programming software9, fit the binarized (white) features with a mosaic of single pixel-high quadrilaterals parallel to the direction of raster scanning (the x-direction) to generate regions of interest (ROIs) that guide the laser position and shutter9,7,30,31,32.\n\tNOTE: The custom algorithm9 converts each individual plane in the TIF image stack to an RLS file.\nChange the file extension of the RLS files to .OVL for use during degradation.\n2. Configuring the Laser-scanning Confocal Microscope\nNOTE: While other laser scanning microscopes equipped with pulsed lasers can be used, the settings and protocol here describe the use of a laser scanning microscope (LSM) in conjunction with its software.\nWith the laser-scanning confocal microscope on, open the microscope software, and click \"Start System.\" Select the objective \"W Plan-Apochromat 20x/1.0 DIC VIS-IR M27 75mm\" in the \"Maintain\" tab.\nSetting the \"Hydrogel Visualization\" Configuration\nIn the \"Acquisition\" tab, ensure that the laser line (514 nm Argon laser) is selected and on in the \"Laser\" window. NOTE: This channel is used to image the hydrogel via eosin Y fluorescence for orientation purposes7.",
    "In the \"Imaging Setup\" window, set the \"Mode\" to \"Channel Mode\", set \"Switch track every\" to \"Frame\", and select \"Track1\".\nIn the \"Light Path\" window, select only the Ch1 fluorescent detector, with a range of 516 to 735 nm; a main beam splitter (MBS) 458/514 filter on the visible light line; and a plate in the invisible light line. Deselect the bright-field photomultiplier tube detector, \"T-PMT\".\nIn the \"Acquisition Mode\" window, check that the correct objective is selected and set the \"Scan Mode\" to \"Frame\", the \"Frame Size\" to \"2884\" in X and Y, the \"Line Step\" to \"1\", the \"Number Averaging\" to \"1\", the \"Averaging Mode\" to \"Line\", the \"Averaging Method\" to \"Mean\", the \"Bit Depth\" to \"16 Bit\", and the \"Direction\" to \"<->\" for bidirectional scanning.\nIn the \"Acquisition Mode\" window, set the \"Speed\" as desired and set \"Corr X\" and \"Y\" to \"0.05\" or adjust as necessary for the specific microscope being used. Deselect \"HDR\".\nIn the \"Acquisition Mode\" window, ensure that the \"Scan Area\" displays an \"Image Size\" of \"531.2 µm x 531.2 µm\" and a \"Pixel Size\" of \"0.18\", with a \"Zoom\" set to \"0.8\"; set all other \"Scan Area\" values to zero.\nIn the \"Channels\" window, select \"Track1\" as the Ch1 fluorescent detector. Select laser line \"514\", with a percent power of \"10.0\", a \"Pinhole\" of \"1AU\", an initial \"Gain (Master)\" of \"800\", a \"Digital Offset\" of \"0\", and a \"Digital Gain\" of \"1\".\n\t\tNOTE: Adjust these settings as necessary for the specific microscope being used.\nSave this configuration as \"Hydrogel Visualization\".\nSetting the \"Channel Formation\" Configuration\nIn the \"Acquisition\" tab, ensure that the laser line (790 nm 140 fs pulsed Ti:S laser) is selected and on in the \"Laser\" window. Set \"GDD Correction\" to \"4000\" for the maximum power output at 790 nm.",
    "Set the \"Imaging Setup\" window as outlined in step 2.2.2.\nIn the \"Light Path\" window, ensure that no fluorescent detectors are selected, with a MBS 458/514/561/633 filter on the visible light line and a MBS 760+ filter on the invisible light line. Deselect the bright-field photomultiplier tube detector, \"T-PMT\".\nIn the \"Acquisition Mode\" window, check that the correct objective is listed. Set the \"Speed\" to \"3\" and all other settings as outlined in step 2.2.4.\nIn the \"Channels\" window, select \"Track1\" as the T-PMT detector. Select the laser line \"790\", with a percent power of \"100.0\", an initial \"Gain (Master)\" of \"800\", a \"Digital Offset\" of \"0\", and a \"Digital Gain\" of \"1\".\nIn the \"Stage\" window, zero the stage by clicking \"set zero\". Mark the location by clicking \"Mark\". This is critical for uploading virtual masks to the microscope macro in step 3.\nIn the \"Time Series\" window, set \"Cycles\" as \"1\" and \"Interval\" as \"0\".\nIn the \"Bleach\" window, check the \"Start Bleaching after # scans\" box and set it to a value of \"0 of 1\". Select the \"Different scan speed\", with a value of \"3\" (corresponding to a pixel dwell time of 8.96 µs/pixel). Select the \"Safe bleach for GaAsP\".\nIn the laser line section of the \"Bleach\" window, select the 790 laser line and set the percent power to \"100.0\". Leave all other boxes in the bleach window unselected. Save the bleach settings in the \"Bleach\" window.\nSave this configuration as \"Channel Formation\".\n\t\tNOTE: The \"Z-Stack\", \"Regions\", \"Focus\", and \"Stage\" windows are also important to this protocol, but do not need to be set or adjusted during initial configuration.\n3. Creating a Recipe and Uploading Virtual Masks to the Microscope Software and Macro",
    "With the laser-scanning confocal microscope still running and the microscope software still on, select only the \"Regions\" window (next to the \"Start Experiment\" button) in the \"Channel Formation\" configuration.\nTo ensure that the masks load to the microscope macro correctly, set the percent power in the \"Channels\" window to \"0.2\" and the \"Speed\" in the \"Acquisition Mode\" window to \"8\", and click \"Snap\" in the upper left of the screen.\nCheck that the image size is still \"531.2 µm x 531.2 µm\", with a pixel size of \"0.18\", in the \"Information\" tab of the image. If these values are not correct, check the \"Frame Size\" and \"Zoom\" values again.\nCRITICAL: Check that the X and Y locations in the \"Stage\" window are zeroed and that the position is marked before opening the microscope macro. Refer to step 2.3.6.\nTo open the microscope macro, type \"Alt+F8\", click \"Load\", and select the correct version. See details in the List of Specific Materials/Equipment. A long list of sub-macros will open in the \"Macro Control\" window.\nIn the \"Macro Control\" window, click \"Run\" to open the microscope macro, and then close the \"Macro Control\" window.\n\tNOTE: Alternative versions of the microscope macro may not be compatible with laser-based hydrogel degradation using this protocol.\nIn the \"Saving\" tab of the microscope macro, provide an arbitrary \"Base File Name\", select \"Single File Output\", and chose a \"Temporary File\" folder. Set \"Open Temp Folder\" to location \"1\", select \"Single Temporary Image Folder\", and name the recipe in \"Store/Apply Recipe\" with \"Recall Locations List\" selected. Click \"Store\" to initially create the recipe.",
    "In the \"Acquisition\" tab of the microscope macro, ensure that the \"Scan Configuration\" matches the name given to the microscope software configuration set in step 2.3. Set the \"No of Time Points within Block\" to \"1\", with an \"Interval\" of \"0\". Ensure that \"Marked Z - Top of the Z Stack\" is highlighted green. All other default settings are fine as they are.\nIn the \"Timing\" tab of the microscope macro, ensure that \"Wait Delay\" is highlighted green, set \"Experiment Repetitions\" and \"Group Repetitions\" to \"1\" and \"Wait Interval Before Block at First Location Only\" to \"0\". All other default settings are fine as they are.\n\tNOTE: The \"Group Repetitions\" (and not the \"Experiment Repetitions\") box is where one can set the number of times the laser scans over a region (i.e., repetitions of the recipe).\nIn the \"Z List\" tab of the microscope macro, the degradation planes in the z-direction are specified. Set the z-spacing, \"dZ\", to \"1 µm\", with the \"Number of Positions\" set to match the number of virtual masks to be used.\nClick the \"Create Z Stack\" button to make the \"Z List\" appear in the dropdown \"List of Locations\" towards the bottom of the window. Check that the number of locations and z-spacing are correct and that the X and Y locations are zeroed.\n\tNOTE: If they are not, do not store the recipe; close the microscope macro and repeat step 2.3.6 before re-opening the microscope macro and setting up the recipe again.\n\tNOTE: Instead of having 100 masks spaced by 1 µm each, for example, it can be advantageous to have 50 masks, each employed twice and spaced by 1 µm, to get an equivalent microfluidic structure, as loading individual masks to the microscope macro can be time-consuming.",
    "In the \"Bleach\" tab of the microscope macro, all of the masks must be loaded and matched with a specific numbered location in the \"List of Locations\". To start, select the \"Bleach\" box and ensure that \"Config.\" matches the name of the bleach settings in the \"Bleach\" window in the main microscope software screen (refer to step 2.3.8). Set \"Wait Delay After Bleach\" to \"0\", deselect \"spot\", and leave the \"ROI\" empty.\nDo not alter anything in the \"Location\", \"Tile\", \"Grid\", \"Autofocus\", \"Blocks\", and \"Options\" tabs from the default settings.\nTo load masks to the microscope macro, select only the \"Regions\" window in the microscope software and open the \"Bleach\" tab of the microscope macro. In the \"Regions\" window, click \"Load\" and select the .OVL file for the mask at the bottom of the z-stack being degraded.\n\tNOTE: The first location in the \"Z list\" is the bottom of the z-stack, and the microscope macro works its way to the top of the z-stack, or hydrogel.\nOnce the list of ROIs appears in the \"Regions\" window, click the arrow button to view the ROIs of the mask within the field of view (on the image snapped in step 3.2). Verify that the ROIs fit within the field of view.\nTo save the loaded mask in the microscope macro, give the mask a name and number in the \"Add Current Region to ROI List\" box on the \"Bleach\" tab, and then click the \"Add Current Region to ROI List\" button. The name and number will appear in the \"ROI\" dropdown list with any other masks (including masks from other previously created recipes). Delete the mask in the \"Regions\" window in the microscope software.\nRepeat steps 3.14 and 3.16 to upload and save all masks to the microscope macro.",
    "To assign uploaded masks to each Z-location, highlight position 1 in the dropdown \"List of Locations\". Select the appropriate ROI from the \"ROI\" dropdown list. Ensure that the \"Bleach\" box is selected at the top of the \"Bleach\" tab in the microscope macro.\nRepeat step 3.18 for all positions in the dropdown \"List of Locations\", and then click \"Store\" on the \"Saving\" tab to save the recipe in its final form.\n4. Photopolymerizing a PEGDA Hydrogel\nMaking Sterile HEPES Buffered Saline (HBS) with Triethanolamine (TEOA)\nIn a 1-L beaker, add 500 mL of DI H2O. With a stir bar, stir in 2.922 g of sodium chloride, 1.196 g of HEPES, and 7.5 mL of TEOA in a fume hood.\nAdjust to pH 8.3 with 1 N sodium hydroxide solution by adding dropwise with a Pasteur pipette.\nSterile filter the solution through a 0.2-µm vacuum filtration cup into a 500-mL autoclaved glass media bottle. Aliquot and store at 4 °C.\nAttach a ring of double-sided adhesive with backing to a specialized 60-mm Petri dish with a 20-mm hole cut out of the bottom. Leaving the backing on the adhesive ring, press out any air bubbles from between the Petri dish and the adhesive.\nPrepare the materials. Bring the synthesized33 3.4 kDa PEGDA out of the -80 °C freezer and allow it to reach room temperature. Turn on the white light source at least 15 min before photopolymerizing hydrogels.\nIn a fume hood, add 1 mL of HBS with TEOA to a foil-covered, 2-mL amber centrifuge tube (used to prevent light exposure of the photoinitiator, eosin Y). Add 10 µL of 1 mM eosin Y disodium salt in DI H2O.",
    "In a fume hood, extract a small volume of 1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NVP) into a glass beaker with a Pasteur pipette. From this volume, pipette 3.5 µL of NVP into the amber centrifuge tube with the HBS, TEOA, and eosin Y.\nIn a second foil-covered, 2-mL amber centrifuge tube (used to prevent errant photoactivation of the prepolymer solution), add 10 mg of 3.4kDa PEGDA. Add 0.2 mL of the HBS, TEOA, eosin Y, NVP solution for a 5% w/v PEGDA pre-polymer solution. Vortex until the PEGDA is fully dissolved. Using a power meter and detector wand, adjust the intensity of the white light source to 95 mW.\nBuilding a Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) Mold\nBuild a PDMS mold7 on a larger surface (glass, polystyrene tissue culture dish) for ease of handling and assemble the molds such that the molded hydrogels fit within a 20-mm diameter circle.\nTo generate a rectangular-shaped hydrogel with a thickness of 500 µm, place two 500 µm-thick PDMS spacers onto a PDMS surface to create two defined hydrogel edges.\nInclude a 300-µm PDMS spacer to impart a 300 µm-deep well in the surface of the hydrogel, which is helpful for introducing fluids.\nPipette 60 µL of the 5% w/v PEGDA pre-polymer solution onto the PDMS mold. Be careful not to introduce any bubbles during pipetting.\nCenter and place a [3-(methacryloyloxy)propyl]trimethoxysilane (TMPSA) functionalized7, 40-mm diameter, #1.5 glass coverslip on top of the solution. Ensure that the coverslip rests on the 500-µm PDMS spacers. The hydrogel will bond to the methacrylated coverslip and prevent the hydrogel from floating in the solution.\nPlace the PDMS, PEGDA pre-polymer solution and coverslip the assembly under the white light source for 3 min.",
    "Flow DI H2O between the mold and the coverslip to separate the hydrogel from the PDMS. Rinse the hydrogel with DI H2O. Dry the edges of the coverslip with lab tissue. Be careful not to touch or wick water from the hydrogel.\nAfter removing the backing from the adhesive, adhere the coverslip to the prepared Petri dish and gently remove air bubbles from between the adhesive and the glass. Submerge the hydrogel in the Petri dish with DI H2O.\n\tNOTE: The PDMS mold can be reused to make additional hydrogels if rinsed with DI H2O, dried with nitrogen, and kept free of dust.\n5. Fabricating Vascular-derived Microfluidic Networks via Laser-based Degradation\nWith the laser-scanning confocal microscope and microscope software on, select the objective \"W Plan-Apochromat 20x/1.0 DIC VIS-IR M27 75mm\" in the \"Maintain\" tab. In the \"Acquisition\" tab, make sure the necessary laser lines (514 nm Argon laser and 790 nm 140 fs pulsed Ti:S laser) are on and warmed up.\nSetting up the Hydrogel to Form an Inlet Channel\nFit the hydrogel and Petri dish on the stage insert and place the stage insert on the microscope stage. Fill the Petri dish with at least 5 mL of DI H2O. Center the hydrogel and well features by eye before lowering the water immersion objective into the DI H2O.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not crush the hydrogel with the objective-the two should never touch!\nTo find the hydrogel, switch to the \"Hydrogel Visualization\" configuration from step 2.2. Click \"Live\" to turn the laser line on and bring the objective closer to the hydrogel until the eosin Y signal (detected by the Ch1 fluorescent detector) of the top of the hydrogel can be seen.",
    "NOTE: To find the hydrogel easily, the percent power can be increased or the pinhole can be opened. Once the objective is focused on the hydrogel, however, drop the percent power to protect the fluorescent detector and decrease the pinhole back to 1AU to avoid oversaturation of the detector and to accurately find the hydrogel surface.\nIn the \"Stage\" window, mark the locations of the top and bottom of the hydrogel and of the bottom of the well.\n\t\tNOTE: The z-values here will help in determining the thickness of the hydrogel and the depth of the well.\nUse the joystick to move in X and Y to find the edge of a well. Place the hydrogel at the right of the screen, with the well at the left, or vice versa. Allow the hydrogel to fill no more than two thirds of the field of view.\nDrop the plane of focus down 150 µm into the hydrogel by setting the \"Step Size\" to \"150\" in the \"Focus\" window and clicking the down arrow next to the \"Z-Position\" box. Repeat step 5.2.4, if necessary.\n\t\tNOTE: The x, y, and z position of the inlet depends solely on the design of the virtual masks.\nCRITICAL: Zero the X and Y location in the \"Stage\" window, delete all other marked locations, and mark only this location.\n\t\tNOTE: If this step is not performed, the microscope macro will not properly restore the locations in the previously saved recipe, and the hydrogel will not be degraded in the desired location.\nForming an Inlet Channel\n\"Snap\" an image and draw a rectangular region that will be the inlet to the vascular network using the rectangle button in the \"Regions\" window.",
    "NOTE: Make sure part of the region extends out into the well to ensure that the inlet will connect the well to the vascular network.\nNext to the ROI generated in the \"Regions\" window, select \"Acquisition\" and deselect \"Bleach\" and \"Analysis\".\nSave the \"Hydrogel Visualization\" configuration, deselect \"Regions\", and change to the \"Channel Formation\" configuration, set up in step 2.3. In the \"Channel Formation\" configuration, select \"Regions\" again.\n\t\tNOTE: When switching between the \"Hydrogel Visualization\" and the \"Channel Formation\" configurations, be sure to deselect regions in the top left of the screen. Sometimes the scaling of regions can change unexpectedly between configurations if this is not done.\nIn the \"Channel Formation\" configuration, make sure that only \"Regions\" and \"Z-Stack\" are selected. In the \"Z-Stack\" window, click the \"Center\" button at the top and then the \"Center\" button above \"Offset\" to set the center of the z-stack as the current Z-position. Depending on how large the inlet needs to be, set the number of \"Slices\" with an \"Interval\" of \"1\". The size of the Z-stack will be displayed underneath \"Range\".\nCheck that \"Speed\" in the \"Acquisition Mode\" window is set to \"3\" and that the \"Percent Power\" in the \"Channels\" window is set to \"100\". Save the configuration and click the \"Start Experiment\" button.\n\t\tNOTE: The microscope macro is not required for degrading the same simple shape on multiple planes, as performed here to generate an inlet channel. The macro is only required when degrading different regions on each individual plane, and it is used to store the virtual masks within a recipe.\nTo visualize the hydrogel during degradation, either increase the \"Gain (Master)\" in the \"Channels\" window if the region in the field of view is black, or decrease the \"Gain (Master)\" if the region is white.",
    "NOTE: Bubble formation here is an indication of laser-induced hydrogel degradation.\nTo degrade the inlet multiple times instead of just once, adjust the \"Cycles\" in the \"Time Series\" window.\nIn the \"Hydrogel Visualization\" configuration, click \"live\" to ensure that the inlet was formed.\nSetting Up the Hydrogel to Generate the Microfluidic Network\nIn the \"Regions\" window, load any .OVL file from the z-stack of virtual masks and click the arrow button to see the ROIs in the field of view.\nClick \"Live\" to live scan the \"Hydrogel Visualization\" configuration and use the joystick or the \"Stage\" window to position the hydrogel in X and Y, such that the inlet connects to the correct location within the vascular network.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure the ROIs of the virtual mask overlap slightly with the previously formed inlet.\nDrop the plane of focus down 50 µm from the previous centered Z-location, or 200 µm from the surface of the hydrogel, using the \"Step Size\" in the \"Focus\" window and clicking the down arrow next to the \"Z-Position\" box. This will be the first position in the microscope macro.\n\t\tNOTE: The actual distance to move in the z-direction depends on the network design. Ensure that the desired network does not extend beyond the top or bottom surface of the hydrogel in the z-direction.\nCRITICAL: Zero the X and Y locations in the \"Stage\" window, delete all other marked locations, and mark only this location.\n\t\tNOTE: This will be the starting point in the microscope macro. The recipe will work its way back towards the surface of the hydrogel.\n\"Snap\" an image in the \"Hydrogel Visualization\" configuration, delete and deselect \"Regions\", and save the configuration.\nGenerating the Microfluidic Network",
    "Change to the \"Channel Formation\" configuration, and only select the \"Time Series\" and \"Bleaching\" windows. Verify that the settings for the \"Time Series\" and the \"Bleaching\" windows are as they were initially set in steps 2.3.7 and 2.3.8.\nSet the \"Speed\" in the \"Acquisition Mode\" window to \"8\" and the percent power of the laser line to \"0.2\" in the \"Channels\" window. Save the configuration.\nOpen the microscope macro following step 3.5. On the \"Saving\" tab of the macro, select the previously made recipe from step 3 and click \"Apply\".\n\t\tNOTE: Do not click \"Store\" or the recipe will be overwritten!\nCheck the settings on all tabs and verify that the virtual masks (.OVL files) are still correctly associated with the Z-locations in the dropdown list. Also check that the first Z-location matches the marked location in the \"Stage\" window of the microscope software.\n\t\tNOTE: Counterintuitively, the second location in the dropdown list will be physically above the first location, as the microscope macro will work its way from the bottom of the hydrogel (farthest away from the objective) to the top of the hydrogel (closest to the objective).\nSave the \"Channel Formation\" configuration again, and then click \"Update\" in the microscope macro. Click \"No\" to \"Overwrite Current Location List?\", and then click \"Start\" in the microscope macro to begin the recipe.\n6. Visualizing the Microfluidic Network\nTo view the hydrogel and the formed microfluidic network after degradation, close the microscope macro. Switch to the \"Hydrogel Visualization\" configuration to view the eosin Y signal of the hydrogel; the degraded network will appear dark.\n\tNOTE: The hydrogel degradation cannot be visualized while the microscope macro is running.",
    "To view the microfluidic network specifically, use the \"Hydrogel Visualization\" configuration at a lower laser power to enable the imaging of introduced fluorescein (FITC)-labeled dextran, which has a brighter signal than the native eosin Y signal of the hydrogel.\nBefore introducing fluorescently labeled dextran, wick water from the well in the hydrogel using lab tissue. Pipette in 10 µL of 5 mg/mL 2,000 kDa FITC-labeled dextran in DI H2O (pre-filtered through a 0.2-µm syringe filter).\n\tNOTE: Use any dextran sized 2,000 kDa or larger to prevent diffusion into the gel. If imaging for longer than 30 min, use an incubated stage with 60% humidity (or higher) to prevent hydrogel drying and evaporation of water from the FITC-labeled dextran solution.\nRemove the hydrogel and Petri dish from the stage and mark the Petri dish to enable the easy location of the formed vascular network during later experimentation."
