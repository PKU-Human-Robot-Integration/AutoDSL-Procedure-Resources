    "NOTE: See the Table of Materials for details about all reagents used in the protocol below. Table 1 enlists lab-made reagents along with optimized volumes and Table 2 shows working concentrations of commercially available reagents.\n1. Cell culture\nMaintain cells whose telomere length is to be measured (used here were A2780 cells, which is an ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line) in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) complete medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), streptomycin, penicillin, and amphotericin B in a 6 cm Petri dish. Incubate at 37 °C in a humidified and controlled environment containing 5% carbon dioxide until the cells are 80%-100% confluent.\nRemove the media and wash with 5 mL of 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nTreat the cells with 1 mL of trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) for detaching the cells by incubating at 37 °C for 3-5 min.\nAdd 2 mL of DMEM complete media to inactivate the trypsin and collect the cells in a centrifugation tube.\nPellet the cells at 2,348 × g for 5 min.\nWash the pellet with 1x PBS and centrifuge at 2,348 × g for 5 min.\nStore the pellet at -80 °C until further use.\n\t​NOTE: The cell count can vary depending on the cell line. We obtained approximately 2.5 × 106 cells in the case of the A2780 cell line, which is used in further steps.\n2. Genomic DNA isolation\nAdd 500 µL of lysis buffer (10 mM tris-Cl, pH 8.0; 25 mM EDTA, pH 8.0; 100 mM NaCl; 0.5% w/v sodium dodecyl sulphate) to the cell pellet and gently mix using a cut tip (with an opening diameter of a minimum 2 mm). Add 20 µg/mL freshly prepared RNase A and mix gently by inversion.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 30 min and occasionally invert the tube during incubation.",
    "Add proteinase K to a final concentration of 100 µg/mL and mix gently by inversion 10 times. Incubate at 55 °C for 2 h. Invert the tube at regular intervals (every 10 min) during incubation.\nAdd 500 µL of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol reagent (25:24:1) and mix gently by inversion 20 times. Centrifuge at 9,391 × g for 15 min at room temperature (around 25 °C).\n\tNOTE: Figure 1A shows the three layers obtained after centrifugation.\nRemove the viscous upper aqueous layer out of the three layers visible, place into a fresh tube using a cut tip, and add an equal amount of chloroform. Mix by gentle inversion 20 times.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 9,391 × g for 15 min at room temperature.\nCollect the aqueous layer and add an appropriate amount of 5 M NaCl so that the final concentration of NaCl is 0.2 M.\nAdd two volumes of 100% ethanol. Mix by gentle inversion 20-25 times. Centrifuge at 15,871 × g for 5 min at room temperature.\nRemove the supernatant and add 500 µL of 70% ethanol to wash the pellet. Centrifuge at 15,871 × g for 5 min at room temperature.\nRemove the supernatant, air-dry the pellet for a few minutes, and add 50 µL of sterile nuclease-free water. Allow the DNA to rehydrate for 1-2 days at room temperature. Mix by pipetting, using the cut tip.\nMeasure the concentration of DNA using ultraviolet (UV)-spectrophotometry. Redilute the samples, if necessary, using sterile nuclease-free water to get a minimum concentration of 300-500 ng/µL.\nCheck for the integrity of the DNA by running it on a 1% agarose gel (Figure 1B).\nStore the diluted DNA at -20 °C until further use.\n3. Digestion of genomic DNA",
    "Prepare an enzyme mixture of Rsa1 (20 U) and Hinf1 (20 U) and add 2 µL of restriction digestion buffer per reaction.\nTake an appropriate volume of genomic DNA such that the total amount of DNA is 1.5 µg. Make up the volume with sterile nuclease-free water, so that the total volume after the enzyme addition is 20 µL.\nMix well by tapping, followed by a pulse spin.\nIncubate the mixture at 37 °C for 2 h.\n4. Agarose gel electrophoresis\nPrepare a 10 cm × 15 cm 0.8% agarose gel in 1x tris acetate EDTA (TAE) buffer using high-grade agarose.\nAdd 5 µL of loading dye to each digested genomic DNA sample, thus making the final volume 25 µL, and load the samples onto the gel.\nPrepare a molecular marker mix by using 1 µL of molecular marker (ladder), 3 µL of sterile nuclease-free water, and 1 µL of 5x loading dye.\nLoad 5 µL of molecular marker mix on both sides of the genomic DNA digested samples if there are a higher number of samples (~10), or only on one side if there are less than or equal to five samples.\nRun the gel at 5 V/cm for 6 h. Once the run is complete, make a notch on one corner of the gel to mark the loading order.\nSubmerge the gel in 0.25 M HCl for 10 min at room temperature with gentle agitation.\nRinse the gel twice with distilled water.\nDenature the DNA by submerging the gel in a solution of 0.5 M NaOH and 1.5 M NaCl twice for 15 min each at room temperature with gentle agitation.\nRinse the gel twice with distilled water.",
    "Neutralize the DNA by submerging the gel in a solution of 0.5 M tris-HCl and 3 M NaCl (pH 7.5) twice for 15 min at room temperature with gentle agitation.\n5. Southern blotting\nCut a nylon membrane of 10 cm × 12 cm in size and make a notch in the same position as the gel.\nActivate the membrane by dipping in distilled water followed by 20x sodium saline citrate (SSC) buffer (see Table 1).\nSet up the transfer.\n\t\nTake a clean glass tray and place another tray in it in an inverted position. Create a wick using regular filter paper such that the ends are touching the base of the outer tray.\nPlace the gel on top of the filter paper. Gently place the activated nylon membrane over the gel, with the notches overlapping, and remove any air bubbles by rolling over a glass rod.\nPlace a 2 cm heap of 9.5 cm × 11.5 cm cellulose filter paper, followed by a 6 cm heap of regular filter paper of the same dimensions. Place a weight atop this setup such that there is equal weight distribution below. Fill the outer tray with 20x SSC buffer (see Figure 2).\nLeave the setup for overnight transfer.\nAfter the Southern transfer, fix the transferred DNA onto the membrane by UV crosslinking on a UV transilluminator or UV crosslinker. Use a 302 nm 8 W lamp for 5 min, or a 254 nm 8 W lamp for 2 min, which corresponds to approximately 120 mJ. Ensure that the membrane side on which the DNA is transferred faces the lamp.\nWash the membrane twice with 25 mL of 2x SSC buffer.",
    "Pause the protocol, if required, by completely drying the blot and storing it at 2-8 °C after loosely wrapping in foil, till further processing.\n6. Hybridization and chemiluminescence detection\nPrewarm the prehybridization buffer to 42 °C.\n\tNOTE: The following steps include volumes of solutions/buffers to be used per 100 cm2 of blot.\nIncubate the membrane in 10 mL of prehybridization buffer for 1 h at 42 °C with gentle agitation for prehybridization.\nAdd 0.5 µL of telomere probe per 5 mL of prewarmed prehybridization buffer to make the hybridization solution.\nIncubate the blot in 10 mL of hybridization solution at 42 °C for 3 h with gentle agitation.\nWash the blot with stringent buffer 1 (Table 1) twice for 10 min (25 mL each) at room temperature with gentle agitation.\nPrewarm stringent buffer 2 (Table 1) for 30 min at 50 °C.\nWash the blot with stringent buffer 2 twice for 15 min (25 mL each) at 50 °C with gentle agitation.\nRinse with 15 mL of wash buffer for 5 min with gentle agitation at RT.\nIncubate the membrane in 10 mL of freshly prepared 1x blocking solution for 30 min at room temperature with gentle agitation.\nIncubate the membrane in 10 mL of anti-digioxigenin conjugated with alkaline phosphatase working solution (see Table 2) for 30 min at RT with gentle agitation.\nWash the blot twice with wash buffer at room temperature for 15 min with gentle agitation.\nIncubate in 10 mL of detection buffer for 5 min at RT with gentle agitation.\nRemove the excess detection buffer and keep the membrane with the DNA facing upward on a hybridization bag or acetate sheet. Add ~1-1.5 mL of substrate solution dropwise onto the membrane, immediately place another sheet on it, and incubate for 5 min at RT.",
    "Squeeze out the excess substrate solution for imaging.\nImage the blot for approximately 20 min in a gel documentation imaging system, collecting multiple images at different time points. Select unsaturated images for further analysis.\n\t​NOTE: In case the signal is weak, imaging can be carried out for a longer period of time.\n7. Analysis\nAfter obtaining the image files, export them for publication in .tif format at the highest resolution possible (600 dpi in this case).\nInstall Telotool software. This requires a specific version (R2012a) of MATLAB (freely available) to run.\nOpen the software and click on the Load Image File button in the top right.\nAfter the image has been loaded, click Invert Image, so that the image background is black and the smears/bands are white.\nCrop the image with the top corners starting from the wells. After the crop selection has been made, right-click inside it and select Crop Image.\nAfter the image has been cropped, click on Calculate Lanes and allow lane detection to occur automatically.\nIf the lanes have not been detected properly, for example, if certain lanes have not been detected at all, or if extra or partial lanes have been detected, perform lane adjustment as described below.\n\t\nClick on Adjust Lanes and in the pop-up window that opens, add and/or adjust lanes as needed, and click on Apply and Close.\nAfter adjusting the lanes, make sure that a red dot is seen on each of the lanes and adjust the ladders using the Ladder Fit button, making sure that the number of peaks in both the ladder lanes are in the same position. Remove any extraneous peaks using the Delete Extremum button.\nAfter the ladders have been adjusted, select Lane Profiles, click on Ladder Fit, and select Polynomial Fit.",
    "Click on Trendline, as recommended by the software, and then select Corrected in the next option.\nClick on Get Results to display the results as a table, in which the Mean TRF row is the telomere length measurement of the respective lane samples.\nClick on Save all to store the results in the form of a spreadsheet.\nSubscription Required.
