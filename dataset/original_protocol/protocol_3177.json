Scheme for metabolic N3-Cho incorporation and fluorescent PC labeling\nSteps 1–11 for metabolic incorporation of N3-Cho into PC in K562 cells. Steps 12–21 for PC labeling in ER-Golgi using BDP-DBCO.

Choose one of the methods below to continue the protocol at step 12 for ER-Golgi, step 22 for plasma membrane, or step 33 for mitochondria.\nOrganelle-specific labeling of N3-PC\nLabeling of N3-PC in the ER-Golgi\nTiming: 45 min\nThis section describes the fluorescence labeling of N3-PC using the ER-Golgi-targeting clickable dye BDP-DBCO (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nNote: 12–21 steps are performed at room temperature.",

    "Note: For K562 cells, typically live cells lie within the range of 20–70 (×10,000) in FSC-A and 10–40 (×10,000) in BSC-A (Gate A). Events with <20 (×10,000) in FSC-A are either debris or dead cells and should be gated out. Any events that lie >70 (×10,000) in FSC-A and >40 (×10,000) in BSC-A are likely non-singlets and should be avoided.\nScatter density plot (FSC-H vs. FSC-W, gate A) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B): Set up a plot for FSC-H vs. FSC-W to exclude doublet.\nNote: Doublet cells can significantly affect your analysis and could lead to inaccurate conclusion.
