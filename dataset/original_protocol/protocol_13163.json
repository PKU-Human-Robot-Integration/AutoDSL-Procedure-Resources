    "Obtain ethical clearance for the study by submitting the study protocol and informed consent document to the local Institutional Review Board (IRB) or local Research Ethics Committee (REC). The study can only begin after IRB or REC approval. The results presented below are from a pilot study, for which subjects signed a written informed consent before enrollment. After IRB or REC approval, prospectively register the protocol in a public repository, like Clinical Trials (https://clinicaltrials.gov). If your country has a national repository, register the protocol there (for example, in Brazil, there is the Brazilian Clinical Trials (https://ensaiosclinicos.gov.br). The present study was approved by the local IRB (certificate number CAAE 63190422.0.0000.5108) and was prospectively registered in a clinical trial registry (ReBEC #RBR-3vj5dc5 https://ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/rg/RBR-3vj5dc5). \n1. Selection and preparation of volunteers\nCalculate the sample size required for the trials\nSelect subjects that: are obese (body mass index >30 kg/m2); have central obesity (waist circumference > 102/88 cm in men/women); are aged >40 years; are capable of performing strength exercises.\nExclude subjects that: show signs, symptoms, or presence of diabetes or any other metabolic disease, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, kidney disease, respiratory disease, and osteoarticular disease27; report using any medication that may influence the expected results (including oral contraceptives28); report using of anabolic steroids; are pregnant or intend to get pregnant during the course of the study; describe dietary supplement intake known to affect exercise performance, such as caffeine, beta-alanine, creatine, and sodium bicarbonate29.\nGet the participant's signature in the informed consent and store it in a private locker.\n2. Measure the participant's body composition\nFor this study, evaluate body composition by means of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, following the manufacturer's instructions for analysis of fat mass, fat-free mass. However, any other established method (i.e., Bod Pod, under water weighing, skin fold) can be used.",
    "3. Dietary control\nSchedule an appointment with the certified nutritionist of the research team to instruct participants on how to log their 3-day (2 weekdays, 1 weekend) diet.\nDevelop a food plan with the nutritionist based on participant energy needs and food intake, to ensure an isocaloric diet the day before and on the day of the sessions30.\n4. Familiarization\nHave participants perform 5 familiarization sessions, separated by at least 2 days.\n\t\nFamiliarization session 1\n\t\t\nInstruct participant on lifting form: range of motion, duration of concentric and eccentric phases (~3 s total rep duration) in each of the 7 strength exercises (1 - hex bar squat; 2 - bench press; 3 - leg press; 4 - lat pulldown; 5 - leg extension; 6 - shoulder press; 7 - leg curl).\nInstruct participant on how to rate their effort based on the OMNI-RES scale30.\nHave participant perform a warm-up of 5 min by walking on a treadmill at ~3-4 km/h.\nHave participant perform 3 sets of 8 repetitions in each of the 7 exercises that they consider easy or between levels 3 and 4 according to the OMNI-RES scale.\nAllow 90 to 120 s recovery between sets and exercises.\nFamiliarization session 2\n\t\t\nInstruct participant on how to answer the affection scale31, 32, the physical activity pleasure scale (PACES)32, 33, and the self-efficacy scale34.\nHave the participant answer the affection scale before the familiarization session.\nHave participant perform a warm-up of 5 min by walking on a treadmill at 3-4 km/h.\nHave the participant perform 3 sets of 8 repetitions in each of the 7 exercises, that they consider hard or between levels 5 and 7 according to the OMNI-RES scale.\nAllow 90 to 120 s recovery between sets and exercises.",
    "Have the participant answer the affection scale, the PACES, and the self-efficacy scale after the familiarization session.\nFamiliarization session 3\n\t\t\nHave the participant answer the affection scale before the familiarization session.\nHave participant perform a warm-up of 5 min by walking on a treadmill at ~3-4 km/h.\nHave participant perform 3 sets of 8 repetitions in each of the 7 exercises, that they consider hard, or between levels 7 and 9 according to the OMNI-RES scale.\nAllow 90 to 120 s recovery between sets and exercises.\nHave the participant answer the affection scale, the PACES, and the self-efficacy scale after the familiarization session.\nFamiliarization session 4\n\t\t\nHave the participant answer the affection scale before the familiarization session.\nHave participant perform a warm-up of 5 min by walking on a treadmill at 3-4 km/h.\nHave the participant perform 3 sets of 8 repetitions in each of the 7 exercises, that they consider hard and extremely hard or between levels 9 and 10 according to the OMNI-RES scale.\nAllow 90 to 120 s recovery between sets and exercises.\nHave the participant answer the affection scale, the PACES, and the self-efficacy scale after the familiarization session.\nFamiliarization session 5\n\t\t\nHave participant mimic the strength tests (see details in step 5). The interval between familiarization sessions can be up to 7 days and can be scheduled based on the presence of delayed-onset muscle soreness.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: This last familiarization session is meant to familiarize participant with the strength tests. It is extremely important in this study to have a thorough familiarization period 1) to make sure participant can perform the sets at or very close to concentric failure18, and 2) to avoid the negative effect of muscle damage on insulin sensitivity35,36,37.\n5. Strength tests (8 repetition maximum)",
    "Perform the strength tests (8 repetition maximum [RM]) in each of the 7 exercises for a total of at least 72 h (but no longer than 7 days) after the last familiarization session.\n\t\nHave participant perform a warm-up for 5 min by walking on a treadmill at 3-4 km/h.\nHave participant perform 1 set with low-load (12 repetitions, 40%-50% of RM, 3-4 OMNI scale) before each exercise.\nAdjust weight to the anticipated load at which the participant will be able to perform 8, but not 9, repetitions with good form. Record this load.\nIf participant is unable to perform 8 repetitions due to loss of good form, to concentric muscular failure, or if participant stops the set voluntarily due to fatigue, reduce the load by 5-10%, let them rest for 3-5 min, and have another attempt.\nIf participant is able to perform 9 repetitions, increase the load by 5-10%, let them rest for 3-5 min, and have another attempt.\nRepeat steps 5.1.4 and 5.1.5 until participant is able to perform 8 but not 9 repetitions and record the load.\n\t\tNOTE: To avoid inter-rater variability, the same research team member should conduct strength tests with all participants.\nPerform the tests in the same order of the exercises described above 1 - hex bar squat; 2 - bench press; 3 - leg press; 4 - lat pulldown; 5 - leg extension; 6 - shoulder press; 7 - leg curl, allowing at least 3 min between exercises.\n\t\t​NOTE: Base the anticipated load on the performance of the fifth familiarization session, when the strength tests will be mimicked. To avoid excessive fatigue, it is optimal to find the 8 RM load in the first attempt of each exercise, but 2 attempts are acceptable.\n6. Random session allocation",
    "Print random sequences with the numbers 1, 2, and 3 that represent high-volume, low-volume and control, respectively, and insert each one inside opaque, sequentially numbered envelope and seal the envelopes.\nOpen the envelopes to reveal session order after the strength tests.\n\t​NOTE: Step 6.1 should be performed by a research collaborator not directly involved in data collection, or responsible for opening the envelopes.\n7. Blind data collection\nInstruct participant not to disclose which session they performed the night before to the employees of the clinical lab where the OGTT will be performed.\nHave a research collaborator, not directly involved in data collection and analyzes, to double entry the data from the OGTT into separate spreadsheets using codes to hide participant's identity and session performed.\n\t​NOTE: Due to characteristics inherent to this study design (exercise), blinding both the participant and the therapist is not possible.\n8. Exercise sessions\nSession 1 - high-volume\n\t\nInstruct participant not to engage in moderate-to-high intensity exercise for at least 2 days before the session.\nInstruct the participant to follow the diet prescribed by the nutritionist the day before and on the day of the session. The last meal is at 6:30 pm\nInstruct the participant to report to the gym at 7:30 pm.\nHave the participant answer the affection scale before the exercise session at 7:55 pm.\nHave participant perform a warm-up for 5 min by walking on a treadmill at 3-4 km/h.\nHave the participant perform 3 sets with as many repetitions as they can (until concentric muscular failure or until participant stops the set voluntarily) in each of the 7 exercises with the load from the 8 RM test and record the number of repetitions in each set.",
    "Ask the participant to rate their effort based on the OMNI-RES scale after each set and record. Allow 120 s recovery between sets and exercises.\nHave the participant answer the affection scale, the PACES, and the self-efficacy scale after they finish the session.\nHave the participant ingest the post-session meal between 9:00-9:30 pm and instruct participant not to ingest anything else (except for water) until the next morning when the OGTT will be performed and send them home.\nSession 2 - low-volume\n\t\nRepeat steps 8.1.1 to 8.1.3. Have participant answer the affection scale at 8:35 pm. Repeat step 8.1.5.\nHave participant perform 1 set with as many repetitions as they can (until concentric muscular failure or until participant stops the set voluntarily) in each of the 7 exercises with the load from the 8 RM test and record the number of repetitions in each set.\nRepeat steps 8.1.7 to 8.1.9\nSession 3 - control day\n\t\nRepeat procedures from 8.1.1 to 8.1.4.\nPosition participant in each exercise/equipment for 30 s (mimicking the active set period) but instruct them not to perform any muscle contraction (or simply to remain still in the exercise/equipment).\nRepeat step 8.3.2 for 3 fake sets for all 7 exercises (mimicking session 1, but without any muscle contraction).\nRepeat steps 8.1.7 to 8.1.9\n9. OGTT and data analysis\nInstruct participants to report to the lab between 7:00 and 7:30 am.\nCollect a fasting blood sample as described in38, 39.\nHave participants ingest 75 g of glucose in 300 mL solution. Collect blood samples at 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, and 120 min post glucose ingestion.\nMeasure plasma glucose and serum insulin concentration in all blood samples as described in38, 39. Plot data from OGTT.",
    "Calculate a) the AUC for glucose and insulin following the trapezoidal rule40; b) the oral glucose insulin sensitivity index41; c) the Matsuda insulin sensitivity index42; d) the Cederholm's index43; e) the muscle insulin sensitivity index44, 45; f) the Gutt index46; g) the Avignon et al. index47; and h) the Stumvoll et al. index48.\n10. Statistical analysis\nAnalyze data blinded to allocation using coded spreadsheets from step 7.2.\nExpress data as mean and standard deviation. Assess data normality with the Shapiro-Wilk test. For normally distributed data, analyze data with one-way analyzes of variance, if a significant main effect is observed, use post hoc Tukey test.\nFor non-parametric data, use the Kruskal-Wallis's test or Friedman's test. Consider significance when p values are lower than 0.05.\nReveal allocation after all statistics are run.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
