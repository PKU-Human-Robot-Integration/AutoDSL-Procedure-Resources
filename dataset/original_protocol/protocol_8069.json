    "1. Cyanobacteria Cultivation\nCultivate Synechocystis cells in Erlenmeyer flasks or in photobioreactors10,19 in buffered BG11 medium20 to maintain a pH of < 10 (e.g., using 17 mM HEPES10).\n\tNOTE: Standard cultivation conditions require a controlled temperature (typically, 30 °C, the optimal temperature is 35 °C)21, illumination (typically, a white light of an intensity up to 800 µmol[photons]/[m2·s])21, and a CO2 supply (in the 400-mL flat-panel photobioreactor, the growth saturating CO2 concentration is 1,700 ppm)21.\nTo determine the culture density, measure the culture optical density spectrophotometrically at 730 nm (OD730) using a cuvette with a light path of 1 cm. Alternatively, count the cells under a microscope using a hemocytometer or an automated cell counter.\n2. Samples Preparation\nWork under low irradiance to prevent phycobiliprotein degradation.\nHarvest 3 x 1 mL of culture suspension to safe-lock tubes. Use triplicates for the estimation of technical errors in the measurement. To perform the culture sampling under sterile conditions, harvest the cells in a laminar hood and follow the proper working and safety practices.\nCentrifuge the cells at 15,000 x g at laboratory temperature for 5 min. Pay attention to the properly balanced centrifuge rotor. After centrifugation, discard the supernatants. Be sure not to disturb the pellet.\nPut the samples in a freezer. For long-term storage, keep the samples at -80 °C. This is necessary to prevent phycobiliprotein degradation. For short-term storage, -20 °C is sufficient.\nFreeze-dry the samples overnight. For a proper freeze-drying process, keep the temperature of the freeze-dryer condenser below -60 °C and the pressure in the freeze-dryer chamber around 1 hPa.\nAfter finishing the freeze-drying cycle, close the tube as soon as possible to prevent the reabsorption of water from the air.\n3. Cell Homogenization and Pigments Extraction",
    "Add four pieces of glass beads (with a diameter of 2 mm) to each sample tube and close the tubes.\n\tNOTE: When the lid of the safe-lock tube used for homogenization is too thin, it can break during the homogenization; therefore, only safe-lock tubes with strong lids are recommended for this protocol.\nHomogenize the samples with the glass beads for 15 s on a homogenizer at laboratory temperature.\n\tNOTE: A properly homogenized sample is spread over the whole inner surface of the safe-lock tubes.\nAdd 1 mL of PBS buffer (pH 7.4), precooled to 4 °C, to the samples in order to extract phycobiliproteins.\n\tNOTE: From this step on, keep the samples on ice to prevent the degradation of the extracted proteins. This is critical.\nMix the samples with PBS for 5 s on the homogenizer at laboratory temperature.\n\tNOTE: After mixing, the samples are greenish.\nAfter mixing, keep the samples on ice for 60 min. Cover the ice bath with a lid to prevent pigments degradation.\nAfter 60 min of phycobiliprotein extraction, centrifuge the samples at 15,000 x g at 4 °C for 5 min. Pay attention to properly balance the centrifuge rotor.\n\tNOTE: After the centrifugation, the supernatant has a cyan blue color.\n4. Phycobiliprotein Quantification\nBefore the spectrophotometric measurement, calibrate the spectrophotometer to the baseline using the PBS buffer as a blank.\nOnce the spectrophotometer is calibrated, discard the PBS from one spectrophotometer cuvette and pipette the supernatant with extracted phycobiliproteins instead of with the discarded buffer.\nQuantify the phycobiliprotein concentration spectrophotometrically, using a slit width of 0.5 nm.\n\t\nMeasure the absorbance of the phycocyanobilins in phycocyanin and allophycocyanin against the PBS buffer blank at 615 nm (A615) and 652 nm (A652), respectively, and measure the absorbance of the cellular debris at 720 nm (A720).",
    "Calculate the concentration of phycocyanin and allophycocyanin according to the equations (1) and (2) of Bennett and Bogorad12:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58076/58076eq1.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58076/58076eq2.jpg\n\t\tNOTE: A615, A652, and A720 should fit to the linear absorbance range of the spectrophotometer. If necessary, dilute the sample with PBS buffer.\nRecalculate the pigment concentration in the original samples. The pigment concentration in the sample corresponds directly with the results of equations (1) and (2) when 1 mL of culture and 1 mL of the extraction buffer are used for the analysis. In case of using different volumes of cyanobacteria samples and/or PBS buffer, the final pigment concentration should be calculated according to equation (3):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58076/58076eq3.jpg   (3)\n\tNOTE: In case of a normalizing phycobiliprotein content per cell dry weight, the final pigment concentration should be calculated according to equation (4)imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58076/58076eq4.jpg  (4)\n5. Determination of the Cell Dry Weight (Optional)\nWeigh three empty safe-lock tubes on analytical balances.\n\tCAUTION: It is critical that the safe-lock tubes are dry. In case of storing the tubes in a wet environment, dry the tubes for several hours in a freeze dryer before weighing them. Manipulate the tubes gently and only with powder-free gloved hands to avoid any contact between the material and the researcher's fingers. Keep all holders and centrifuge clean to avoid the transfer of any material to the tubes.\nSample 1 x 15 mL of culture suspension to 15-mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge the culture suspension in the 15-mL conical tubes at 4,000 x g at laboratory temperature for 10 min. Balance the centrifuge rotor with three additional 15-mL conical tubes, each containing 15 mL of water. After centrifugation, discard 12 mL of the supernatant.",
    "Resuspend the pellet in the remaining supernatant and transfer 3 x 1 mL of the mixture to three 1.5-mL safe-lock tubes with a pipette. In case some leftovers of the pellet remain in the 15-mL conical tube, add 1.5 mL of deionized water to the conical tube, vortex or shake the tube to resuspend the remaining pellet, and transfer 3 x 0.5 mL of the mixture to the three 1.5-mL safe-lock tubes (already containing 3 x 1 mL of the pellet) with a pipette.\n\tNOTE: Dividing the pellet over three 1.5-mL safe-lock tubes will allow the estimation of any technical error of the dry weight measurement.\nCentrifuge the cells in 1.5-mL safe-lock tubes at 15,000 x g at laboratory temperature for 5 min. Balance the centrifuge rotor with an additional 1.5-mL safe-lock tube that contains 1 mL of water. After the centrifugation, discard the supernatants.\nPut the samples in the freezer. For long-term storage, keep the samples at -80 °C; for short-term storing, -20 °C is sufficient.\nFreeze-dry the samples overnight. For a proper freeze-drying process, keep the temperature of the freeze dryer condenser below -90 °C and the pressure in the freeze-dryer chamber around 1 hPa.\nAfter freeze-drying, close the tubes and weigh the samples on analytical balances.\n\tNOTE: The dry weight value can be used for the normalization of the phycobiliprotein content per cell dry weight.\nSubscription Required.
