    "All methods described here have been approved by The Northern B Health and Disability Ethics Committee, reference number: 13/NTB/181.\n1. Technical Requirements\nUse an air puff unit capable of administering a puff of air directly to the cornea. This can be achieved using a flexible tube attached to an air tank via an air compressor. To ensure the infant's safety, fit this with an adjustable pressure regulator that restricts air pressure and limits air puff duration.\n\tNOTE: Commercially available systems incorporate the compressor within the system, and do not require an air tank.\nUse an adjustable headband or hat that can be worn by the infant and allows appropriate positioning of the air puff tubing beside the eye.\nSet up two portable audio speakers with adjustable volume settings.\nDesign and set up computational control of the equipment so that the tone and air puff can be administered automatically with precise timing and at varying intervals.\nSet up a portable video camera with at least a 60-Hz frame rate to manually record eyeblink responses. To measure response times, use a video camera that can capture the trial onset, either by recording the audible tone or by filming a trial onset indicator programmed into the software package.\nInstall and run any video editing software that allows frame-by-frame stepping of both audio and video components (e.g., Adobe Premiere Pro) to allow the researcher to measure the time interval between the stimulus and the blink response.\n2. Experimental Paradigm\nAdminister trials in blocks of 10. Each block should contain the following trial types.\n\t\nInclude eight paired trials, where each learning trial consists of a 750-ms tone (80 dB, 1 kHz) that overlaps and terminates with a 100-ms air puff (~1/20 psi)9,10,11.",
    "Include an unpaired trial, that consists of a single 750-ms tone presented alone in the absence of the air puff to test for a conditioned eyeblink response indicating associative learning.\nInclude a somatosensory trial consisting of a single 100-ms air puff trial presented alone in the absence of the tone to test for corneal sensitivity to the air puff and the correct positioning of the headband.\nRandomize the interval between consecutive trials (e.g., 8 - 16 s, with an average trial time interval of approximately 12 s)9,10,11.\nMeasure five consecutive blocks (i.e., a total of 50 trials) in a single session, for a total session time of approximately 12 min.\nTo test whether conditioning persists, administer two EBC sessions of 50 trials at least 1 h apart.\n3. Testing Procedure\nPerform EBC in a moderately lit room (~300 lux) with consistent lighting levels between experiments.\nPosition the two portable speakers on either side of the infant, approximately 40 cm from either side of the head.\nPlace the custom-made headband on the infant's head and adjust for head size.\nPosition the flexible tube holding the air puff nozzle and adjacent infrared sensor so that these are approximately 1 - 3 cm from the child's right eye at a ~45° angle from the axial plane of the head (Figure 1).\nBefore beginning the experiment, check that the experimental set-up is optimized to deliver the corneal air puff. Deliver a single test air puff to the infant's eye and observe whether an eyeblink occurs and is visible on the video camera. If no eyeblink is observed, adjust the headband positioning so that the air puff unit is closer to the eye.",
    "Record the infant's eyeblink responses throughout the duration of the experiment. Position the video camera so that the field of view is directed toward the infant's eyes. The camera should be close enough to discern small eye movements, but not so close such that the infant can move outside the frame if he/she becomes fussy.\nEnsure the experimenters are masked to the stimulus timing. If the EBC user interface indicates when the next trial will occur, ask the researcher to orient themselves away from the computer interface so that they are not aware when the next stimulus will be delivered. This will prevent the researcher from responding to the stimulus themselves and potentially contributing to the infant's learned responses.\n4. Optimizing the Experimental Set-up for One-year-old Infants\nEnsure that two researchers are available to conduct the experiment.\nWhen placing the headband on the infant, ask the caregiver to position the infant on their lap facing sideways. This allows the researcher to approach from the side and behind the infant's head, while a second researcher engages the infant.\nPlacing the headband and positioning the nozzle should be performed as quickly and calmly as possible to ensure the infant's compliance. Placing a hand over the tip of the nozzle prevents the infant from turning their head into the nozzle during positioning.\nKeep the infant on the caregiver's lap throughout the experiment.\n\tNOTE: While a high-chair may provide a more consistent environment between experiments, this may increase anxiety and reduce compliance in many infants.\nFor infants inclined to interfere with the headband during the experiment, use gentle distraction.",
    "The headband commonly moves during the experiment. If the infant is no longer responding to the air puff or the headband has moved significantly away from the eye, pause the experiment and adjust the headband position before continuing.\nEncourage the child to look up during the experiment in order to increase the magnitude of the eyeblink movements; this way, eyeblink detection may be improved.\n\tNOTE: This can be achieved by placing the infant in front of a monitor playing an infant friendly video (e.g., an age-appropriate cartoon with the audio turned off) slightly above their line of sight.\n5. Eyeblink Detection Using Video Camera Recordings\nLet two researchers independently define the eyeblink responses for each experiment.\nUse video editing software to analyze each trial for a 2,000-ms latency following trial onset.\nUse the audio waveform to detect the first frame of the trial onset.\n\t\nFor the paired (CS + US) and unpaired (CS only) trials, define trial onset from the beginning of the audible tone.\nFor the somatosensory trials where only the US (air puff) is presented, perform pretesting to ensure that the camera's microphone can detect the subtle 100-ms noise created by the air puff. Otherwise, video recording of the trial onset indicator programmed into the software package will aid in detecting the air puff onset.\nUse the video track to detect the blink response. Record blink latency as both the following: Blink onset-the first frame where the eyelids begin to close; Blink peak-the first frame where the eyelids are maximally closed.\nAs needed, develop strategies to handle ambiguous responses. See the following examples.\n\t\nReasonably exclude partial blinks, which may occur when the eyelids fail to completely close by more than ~50%.",
    "Exclude trials where the tone/air puff onset is concealed by extraneous noise, or where the blink response is obscured from view, from further analyses.\nIn trials where multiple blinks are observed, analyze the first blink response following trial onset.\nRecord the number of video frames between the stimulus onset and the blink peak. Convert the latency into real-time based on the sampling rate of the video camera.\n6. EBC Response Classification\nAfter detecting those trials in which an eyeblink response occurred, define the type of blink, based on its latency relative to the stimulus onset (Figure 2).\n\t\nDefine a blink as a startle response if it occurs within the first 200-ms interval after the tone; these represent a reflex response to the auditory tone, or blinks that are timed coincidentally with tone onset that would have occurred independently of the air puff.\n\t\tNOTE: Startle responses may be observed for the paired (CS + US) or unpaired (CS only) trials, where the auditory tone is delivered.\nDefine a blink as a somatosensory response if it occurs in response to the air puff; it indicates whether the cornea is sensitive to the air puff with the current headpiece configuration. This is a type of unconditioned response (see below).\nDefine unconditioned responses as somatosensory responses to the air puff during paired (CS + US) trials that occur more than 650 ms after the tone onset.\nDefine conditioned responses as blinks that are optimally timed to coincide with the air puff. They are initiated between 350 to 650 ms after the tone onset for the paired or unpaired trials and indicate that associative learning between the CS and US may have occurred.",
    "Define a trial as failed responses if no blink was detected in response to the air puff; these can be observed for the paired (CS + US) trials or the somatosensory trials. These responses indicate that the air puff is not reaching the eye.\n7. Analysis of Associative Learning\nNote: A number of methods have been previously described to assess associative learning9,10,11 (described briefly here). Researchers should modify these methods or develop their own to define whether associative learning has occurred, depending on their experimental design.\nFirst, exclude trials in which no usable data was collected, such as those with technical errors.\nCalculate the sensitivity to the air puff by calculating the percentage of eyeblink responses from all possible somatosensory trials.\nAssess whether associative learning has occurred during the experiment by comparing the percentage of conditioned responses in sequential blocks of 10 trials. An increase in the percentage of conditioned responses over the course of the experiment may indicate conditioning has occurred.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, modeling the change in eyeblink latencies over time could be used to assess whether the infant has adapted their response times during the course of the experiment.\nAssess whether associative learning is occurring across experimental sessions or between two experimental groups. Use an arbitrary criterion to define whether conditioning has occurred (e.g., > 40% conditioned responses within an experimental session)6,9."
