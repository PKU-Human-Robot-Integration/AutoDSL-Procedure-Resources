  "procedures": [
    "Preparation of FLARE conidiaHarvest conidia from 7-10 days old slants (Sabouraud dextrose agar slants) grown at 37 °C by adding 10 ml ice-cold PBST (0.025% Tween-20 in PBS) and pipetting multiple times with gentle scrapping. Note: Maintain conidia at 4 °C or on ice for all subsequent steps unless otherwise stated. All infection and animal studies need to be performed following biosafety level 2 (BSL2).Filter the conidial suspension sequentially through a 100 μm and a 40 μm cell strainer to eliminate hyphal fragments. Centrifuge the filtered suspension at 400 x g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the conidial pellet in 10 ml PBST. Count the conidia using a hemocytometer and adjust the final concentration to 5-6 x 108 conidia per ml.Centrifuge desired amount of conidial suspension at 400 x g for 5 min, discard supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 50 mM NaHCO3 (pH 9.5) maintaining the final concentration as 5 x 108 conidia per ml. Add 0.5 mg/ml Biotin-XX, SSE (6-((6-((biotinoyl)amino)hexanoyl)-amino) hexanoic acid), sulfosuccinimidyl ester, sodium salt (stock 50 mg/ml in DMSO) to the conidial suspension and incubate with rotation in the dark.Note: A minimum of 2 h incubation is recommended for efficient biotinylation. This step can be extended for up to 12 h (O/N incubation). The tubes containing biotinylated conidia should be covered with aluminum foil at all times.Centrifuge and decant the supernatant. Neutralize unbound biotin by resuspending the pellets and incubating conidia in 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 30 min with constant rotation.Repeat step A6 and resuspend the biotinylated conidia in (indicate volume) PBS containing 0.02 mg/ml AF633-streptavidin (stock 2 mg/ml in PBS). Incubate for 30 min at RT with constant rotation.Wash once with PBST and adjust the concentration to 6 x 107 per ml for intratracheal challenge.",
    "Note: Check the labeling efficiency by flow cytometry before using the FLARE conidia for experiments (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160908/20160908215920_6137.jpgFigure 1.

Flow plots depict fluorescence intensity of (A) unlabeled, (B) AF633-labeled, (C) DsRed-labeled, and (D) FLARE conidia in AF633 (X-axis) and DsRed (Y-axis) channels using a BD LSR II flow cytometer equipped with 532 nm and 633 nm lasers.Murine intratracheal challenge with FLARE conidiaAdjust conidial suspension at 6 x 108/ml. Load a 1 ml syringe fitted with a curved blunt-ended, 20 gauge precision tip (Figure 2; lower syringe) with 50 μl conidial suspension (typical inoculum: 3 x 107 conidia) and expel any air bubbles. The inoculum volume should not exceed 75 μl.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160908/20160908220118_6435.jpgFigure 2. Curved blunt-ended 20 G tip used to administer conidia intratracheally. The injection syringe (lower syringe) was fabricated from a straight 20 G syringe (upper syringe) by applying heat via a Bunsen burner.Anaesthetize mice using an isoflurane unit that pumps a mixture of isoflurane (3.5%, vol/vol) and oxygen in an anesthesia chamber.Confirm anesthesia by monitoring breathing rate and by toe pinch. Once anesthetized, immobilize the mouse in an upright position on an angled plexiglass stand by hooking its incisors onto a rubber band. Secure the mouse torso with a second rubber band (Figure 3). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160908/20160908220213_9144.jpgFigure 3. Anaesthetized mouse that is immobilized in preparation for intratracheal administration of conidia.Gently grasp the tongue on one side (typically right hand) using forceps and then grasp tongue with gloved left thumb and forefinger, opening the jaw and flexing the jaw forward. With the right hand guide the syringe containing inoculum over the tongue towards its trachea until a hub of the catheter has been inserted into oral cavity (Figure 4). Push the plunger to deliver inoculum and withdraw the syringe quickly to avoid suffocation.",
    "There should be no resistance to delivering the inoculum.  Note: A video demonstration of murine intratracheal administration can be seen at Hasenberg et al. (2011).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160908/20160908220327_2813.jpgFigure 4. Intratracheal administration of conidia.Remove the mouse from the plexiglass stand and place it back into its original cage. Monitor the mouse until it starts moving and then proceed to the next mouse. Once all mice are inoculated and regained conscious, return the cage to the rack.Tissue harvestEuthanize mice by injecting sodium pentobarbital solution, 300 mg/kg body weight via the intraperitoneal route. When the mouse is euthanized (4-6 min), exsanguinate the animal by making an incision in abdominal aorta to minimize blood contamination during BAL procedures. Expose trachea by dissecting out tissues from neck and make a minute incision into the trachea to allow the passage of 18 G lavage catheter through it (Figure 5).Insert a BALF catheter into the mouse trachea and repeatedly inject 0.5 ml of ice cold PBS/5% FBS (from the “input” syringe filled with 3 ml of PBS/5% FBS) and then aspirate BALF from the inflated lungs into the initially unfilled “output” syringe via a 3-way stopcock. Typically, we inject a total of 3 ml and recover 2.5 ml of BALF in the output syringe. The 3-way stopcock is adjusted after each injection and aspiration step to ensure that BALF is captured in the output syringe.Transfer BALF into empty tubes and store on ice. Collect lungs in tubes containing 2 ml ice cold PBS and store on ice. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160908/20160908220536_1687.jpgFigure 5. BALF harvest using a 3-way stopcock.Lung processingTransfer lungs into gentleMACS C tubes each containing 5 ml of freshly prepared lung digestion buffer.Attach the tubes onto the gentleMACS dissociator and run program “m_lung_01” to dissociate lung samples.",
    "Incubate the tubes for 45 min at 37 °C on the MACS mix tube rotator to allow digestion. Bring the tubes back to the gentleMACS dissociator and run program “m_lung_02, which completes preparation of single cell suspension of lung samples.Briefly spin tubes (300 x g for 1 min) to bring cells at the bottom and using a pipette, transfer the contents into fresh 15 ml tubes. Note: All subsequent steps are to be performed at 4 °C unless otherwise mentioned. Centrifuge the tubes at 300 x g for 5 min, discard supernatant and lyse RBCs by resuspending pellet in 1 ml of 1x RBC lysis buffer for 5 min at RT. Following RBC lysis, add 9 ml of ice cold 5% FBS/PBS to each tube and pass the entire 10 ml lung suspension through a 100 μm cell strainer into fresh 15 ml tubes.Centrifuge tubes, discard supernatant and resuspend cells in 2 ml ice cold 5% FBS/PBS.Count cells in an automated cell counter, transfer 200 μl cell suspension (approx. 2-5 million cells) in a U-bottom, 96-well plate and prepare for staining with fluorescent antibodies. BALF processingSpin tubes containing BALF at 300 x g for 5 min, discard supernatant and transfer the pellets in a U-bottom, 96-well plate for staining with fluorescent antibodies.Flow cytometry of lung and BALF cell suspensionResuspend the lung and BALF samples in 50 μl of FACS buffer containing Fc block in 1:100 dilution, incubate at 4 °C for 10 min. Wash the cells once in FACS buffer and add 50 μl of stain cocktail mix containing antibodies (purchased from ebiosciences/BD/AbD serotec) listed below:Ab staining cocktail for lung neutrophils and Ly6Chi monocytes (Figure 6)CD45.2 (clone 104) - PerCP-Cy5.5Ly6G (1A8) - FITCLy6C (clone AL-21) - PE-Cy7Ly6B.2 (clone 7/4) - AF700CD11b (clone M1/70) - Pacific BlueNeutrophils: CD45.2+Ly6G+Ly6CloCD11b+Ly6B.2+ Monocytes: CD45.2+Ly6G-Ly6ChiCD11b+Ly6B.",

Wash once, resuspend in FACS buffer and analyze with flowcytometry within 1 h.",
