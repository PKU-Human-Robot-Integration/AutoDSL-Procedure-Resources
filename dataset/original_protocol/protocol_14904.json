    "All animal procedures were performed with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Cincinnati and in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals from the National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85-23, Revised 1996).\n1. Preparing the Mouse\nEuthanize by exposing the animal to a supratherapeutic dose of anesthetic, isoflurane inhaled to effect. Verify primary euthanasia via toe pinch as a noxious stimulus. Secondary method of euthanasia, diaphragm cutting, will occur in an upcoming step. Alternative methods may be used granted euthanasia is obtained.\nSanitizie the external surface of the mouse by spraying the fur along the abdominal region, where the initial cuts will be made, with 70% ethanol to the point of moisture so that the fur is wet with ethanol and any loose/dry hairs do not enter the region.\nLay the mouse out on a surgical board in the supine position with upper and lower appendages extended outward.\nSecure appendages to the board using surgical tape.\n2. Isolation of the Heart and Aorta\nAfter proper positioning of the mouse, use forceps to locate and isolate abdominal skin just inferior to the xiphoid process of the sternum.\nCreate tension by lifting the skin straight up and use scissors to remove the superficial skin, exposing the superior portion of the peritoneum and inferior portion of the thoracic cavity.\nEnter the peritoneal cavity by lifting the xiphoid process and making lateral incisions just inferior to the process along the subcostal margins.\nDissect up into the thoracic cavity, going through the diaphragm, being sure not to lacerate the heart or any major blood vessels.",
    "Extend the lateral incisions made in step 2.3 cranially to remove the anterior portion of the ribcage. If necessary, free the heart from the anterior chest wall using blunt dissection.\nClean the chest cavity of extraneous blood and fluid by using sterile gauze to absorb material. Once the area is more visible, remove the lungs to better expose the heart and aorta.\n3. Perfusion of Heart and Aorta\nNOTE: To obtain blood via cardiac puncture, do so just prior to this step.\nFill a 10 cc syringe with 10 ml of sterile ice cold 1x phosphate buffer solution (PBS), and attach a 25 gauge needle to the syringe.\nGently insert the needle into the left ventricle of the heart.\nCut the right atrium to alleviate pressure buildup from perfusion. Perfuse the contents of the syringe into the mouse over 2 - 3 min.\nUse sterile gauze at the opening in the right atrium to absorb perfusion fluid.\n4. Isolation and Excision of the Aorta\nUpon completion of perfusion, use sterile gauze to absorb any remaining fluid clouding the field of view within the thoracic cavity.\nExpose the gastrointestinal contents by cutting caudally through the abdominal wall, extending the incision to the suprapubic area. Extend the incision further towards the lower limbs bilaterally to create skin flaps which can be pinned down or excised.\nRemove the lobes of the liver, pancreas, stomach, spleen, and intestines to better visualize the aorta. Take care when dissecting near the perirenal region, as the aorta is superficial at the branches of the renal arteries.\n\tNOTE: Perform this step in a precise and matriculate manner as the gastrointestinal tract is rich with bacteria which increases the propensity for contamination.\nRinse the area with 1x PBS and remove all fluid by absorption with a sterile gauze.",
    "Using sterile microscissors and microforceps, separate the aorta from the spine dorsally and the esophagus ventrally. It is best to use blunt dissection and utilizing a dissection microscope for this.\n\tNOTE: In isolating the aorta, start caudally at the iliac bifurcation and move cranially cleaning and separating the aorta from the dorsal surface of the cavity or start cranially at the carotids and brachiocephalic arteries dissecting caudally. Either method is appropriate and is up to the researchers comfort.\nRemove the perivascular adipose tissue using fine microscissors being sure not to remove a portion of the aortic wall. This is essential to minimize the potential for fibroblast contamination when culturing aortic smooth muscle cells.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
