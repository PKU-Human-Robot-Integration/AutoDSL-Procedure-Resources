    "ALL ANIMAL WORK HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT UNDER AN ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITEE APPROVED PROTOCOL AND EXECUTED IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL RELEVANT GUIDELINES, REGULATIONS AND REGULATORY AGENCIES.\nFor troubleshooting reference Table 2.\n1. Bone Marrow Reconstitution (Optional) Figure 1 (30 min prep, 5 min per mouse)\nAll surgery should be performed using strict aseptic technique with autoclaved sterile equipment.\nOne donor mouse will reconstitute three host mice.\nAnaesthetize recipient NODscid mice and position, with lead to shield the head, inside the center of the Gammacell 40 'exactor' irradiator.\nIrradiate NODscid mice with 2.5 Gy total body irradiation (TBI).\nCRITICAL STEP: Optimization of TBI may be needed due to variation in dose required for sufficient host immune cell depletion in different mouse strains.\nPause point: Host mice can be irradiated in advance but should be used within 24 hr of irradiating.\nEuthanize donor mice according to the institutional animal care committee guidelines. Clean the hindlimbs and remove the tibia and femur from both, stripping all excess tissue from the bones (Figures 1ai, 1aii).\nCRITICAL STEP: Fibular bones are not viable for use due to very narrow lumen.\nRemove end plates from both ends of four extracted bones and flush them out using a 22 G needle and 1 ml sterile PBS until they are white in appearance (Figure 1aiii). Reference Table 2.\nMix the extracted bone marrow (BM) suspension well and draw 300 μl into three 27 G tuberculin needles. Extracted BM should contain approximately 2 x 107 cells and is enough for 3 host mice reconstitutions. Reference Table 2.\nInject the suspension into the lateral tail vein of three previously irradiated NODscid mice from step 1.1 (Figure 1b). Reference Table 2.",
    "CAUTION: To check sterility of the BM injected we recommend plating the remaining BM and culture for 24 hr to check for infection. Primary cause of death at this point is infection in the newly reconstituted mice.\n2. Intracranial Window Generation - Figure 2 (30 min per mouse)\nAll surgery should be performed using strict aseptic technique with autoclaved sterile equipment and under a heat lamp to keep animals warm (Figure 2A).\nAnaesthetize recipient NODscid mice with IACUC approved anesthetic, Avertin IP injection at 0.5 mg/g and position, with lead to shield the head, inside the center of the Gammacell 40 'exactor' irradiator. Remove hair from the scalp. In addition apply tear gel to prevent corneal dehydration.\nClean scalp first with Betadine solution and then with alcohol, then make an incision from the midpoint of the ears to just above the eyes. Remove scalp 3 mm either side of the first incision, exposing the skull and landmarks of the skull surface (Figure 2Bi).\nElevate the periosteum by injecting 2% lidocaine:epinephrine solution and dissect away from skull surface (Figure 2Bii).\nUsing 2.7 mm trephine drill, weaken a 2.7 mm circle of the skull over the cortex of the right hemisphere between lambda and bregma. DO NOT penetrate the bone with the drill (Figure 2Biii). Reference Table 2.\nCRITICAL STEP: if drill goes through the skull the brain surface will be damaged influencing results with additional trauma. In addition excessive bleeding will occur preventing a clear window from being generated.\nRemove the weakened bone flap using dissection tweezers and dental hook and deliberate but controlled force (Figure 2Biii).\n(Optional) If looking at tumor pathology, inject chosen tumor cell lines (with fluorescent reporter gene) into the center of the window generated in step 2.5.",
    "Load 10 μl 30 G Hamilton syringe with cell suspension and load needle into a stereotactic frame.\nCRITICAL STEP: Cell number will need to be optimized for tumor cells in use and timeline of growth required. For U87 cultures we use 2 x 105 cells in 10 μl per mouse.\nLoad mouse onto the digital stereotactic frame align the needle to the center point of the window generated.\nLower needle until it just touches the cortical surface and reset the digital coordinates.\nLower the needle to 3.2 mm into the cortical tissue and inject at 3 mm deep.\nRetract needle slowly then remove mouse from the frame.\nCRITICAL STEP: Inject solution over the duration of 1 min and leave needle in position following injection to ensure reduced back flow.\nCRITICAL STEP: If minor hemorrhaging is encountered irrigate with sterile saline for 1-5 min to stop superficial bleeding. Proceed with subsequent steps.\nDampen brain surface with a drop of sterile PBS to keep the brain tissue irrigated.\nFloat a 3 mm coverslip onto brain surface to seal fully around the 2.7 mm window generated. Reference Table 2.\nDry surrounding skull bone then apply vetbond to the entire exposed skull to reseal scalp tissue to the skull bone and the coverslip in place. DO NOT apply an excess as it will leak under the glass and decrease the imaging potential.\nMix fresh dental acrylic powder and solution, roughly 30% (w/v), and apply over the top of the vetbond. To ensure a tight seal overlap the acrylic slightly onto the glass coverslip edge (Figure 2Biv). Reference Table 2.\nCAUTION: Dental acrylic is extremely hazardous so we recommend use of gloves and mask throughout the procedures.",
    "CRITICAL STEP: Dental acrylic needs to remain pliable during molding to ensure a good seal and reduce excess. Build up of acrylic on the window will blur images.\nAllow mice to recover in a warm cage.\n3. Stereotactic Radiation (Optional) - Figure 3 (25 min per mouse)\nVariations will exist in the different irradiators used and as such optimization will be required. We used a custom designed irradiator.\nAnaesthetize mice using Isoflurane at 4% for induction followed by 1.5-2% throughout the procedure with 0.5-1 liter O2 a min, and place onto custom head restrainer inside the stereotactic irradiator (Figure 3Ai).\nObtain a 360° cone beam CT scan with the X-ray tube running at 40 kVp and 0.05 mA through a 2 mm aluminum filter. Use the image to guide the movement of the stage, directing the radiation isocentre to the right hemisphere ensuring it is central in the Dorsal Ventral direction.\nInsert the hemispheric collimator, 8 mm x 11 mm block.\nCRITICAL STEP: Collimators can be designed for many different setups and so can be enhanced to include and exclude different parts of the brain. 8 mm x 11 mm defines a hemispheric area of the brain.\nObtain single CT orthogonal images both from top (AP) and bottom (PA) through the collimator to further enhance the placement of the brain, anatomical bone structures can be used for reproducibility.\nExchange the aluminum filter for a 0.93 mm copper treatment filter and administer half of the desired radiation dose with the X-ray tube running at 225 kVp and 13 mA from the top in an AP direction.\nReturn gantry to the bottom position and administer the second half of the radiation dose again with the X-ray tube running at 225 kVp and 13 mA form the bottom in a PA direction.",
    "CRITICAL STEP: It is essential to irradiate from both the top and the bottom to reduce the RT gradient through the brain tissue, it also aids with the alignment of the isocentre to the center of the brain.\n4. In vivo Two Photon Laser Microscopy - Figure 3 (1-3 hr per session)\nVariations will exist in the different microscopes used and as such optimization will be required. We used a Carl Zeiss LSM510 META Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope.\nAnaesthetize mice with IACUC approved anesthetic, Avertin IP injection at 0.5 mg/g and clean window using alcohol spray.\n(Optional) Inject tagged vascular dye 5-10 min prior to imaging, into the tail vein prior to imaging. Alexa647-Dextran used at 0.35 μg/g or APC-CD31 used at 0.2 μg/g. See Table 2.\n(Optional) Inject Fluorescein via the tail vein at a dose of 7.7 mg/kg, 5 min prior to imaging, to delineate tumor. Reference Table 2.\nSetup channels on the confocal microscope as determined by the fluorochrome used in the chimeric mouse generated. Table 1 demonstrates the channels described in this model.\nInvert mouse onto the moveable microscope stage and stabilize the head in position with moldable plasticine. (Figure 3Aii) Reference Table 2.\nCRITICAL STEP: The ICW needs to be perpendicular to the laser point and as such must be positioned horizontally to ensure the imaging is optimal.\nTurn on first channel laser and use to position in the center of the ICW.\nUse 5x lens and take an image of the entire window to use as a map for further higher resolution images.\nImaging should be carried out using 10X and 20X 'long range' lenses to get the best image quality.",
    "CRITICAL STEP: Channels and objectives on the 2PLM should be set up using engineered cells in vitro prior to the imaging of murine models to ensure they highlight the correct fluorochrome.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4,5\nFluorochrome,CFP,GFP / Fluorescein / FITC,mCherry / RFP / DsRED,APC / Alexa647,SHG Autofluorescence\nExcitation laser,458 nm,488 nm,543 nm,633 nm,Chameleon laser 820 nm\nCollection Filter,480-520 nm,500-550 nm,565-615 nm,650-710 nm,390-465 nm\nTable 1. Fluorochrome setup. Guides for the user to see the excitation laser and emission spectra collector used for each of the channels available in the model."
