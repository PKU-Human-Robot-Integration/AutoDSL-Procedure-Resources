    "1. Experimental planning and considerations\nUse pre-existing crystals of the protein of interest, preferably generated through vapor diffusion crystallization. For a generalized protocol of vapor diffusion crystallization, see Benvenuti and Mangani34. Other methods of crystallization such as microbatch under oil and free interface diffusion will require harvesting the crystals prior to crushing to generate microseeds.\nIn the preparation of a seed stock, use the highest quality crystals that can be sacrificed. The highest quality crystal can be judged visually based on morphology or the best diffracting crystal can be selected, if such data is available. It is very likely that even better quality crystals are obtained after optimization through seeding. In the case where no crystals are available, crystalline precipitate such as spherulites and needles can be used.\nIdentify salt crystals. Salt crystals can grow in crystallization screens and can look like protein crystals. Using salt crystals in rMMS will provide no benefit and will waste precious sample, so it is important to eliminate salt false positives.\n\t\nSalt crystals are loud when they are crushed. Crystals must be crushed to generate a seed stock, so this strategy is particularly relevant. If an audible crack sound is heard when crushing up the crystals, the crystal is likely to be salt.\nIf the protein contains tryptophan and tyrosine residues, use ultraviolet fluorescence microscopy to identify protein crystals which fluoresce under these lighting conditions.\nUse Izit dye (methylene blue) to stain protein crystals to differentiate them to salt crystals which remain relatively unstained. However, this procedure is more destructive and is only recommended if one has crystals to spare from replicates of the same drop.",
    "NOTE: Although the aforementioned tests may give promising results, salt crystals may still be mistaken for protein crystals. In this case, diffraction experiments can be used to definitively discern between a protein and salt crystal.\n2. Preparation of lithium I3C stock\nMeasure out 120 mg of I3C (5-amino-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalic acid) into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nDissolve I3C in 200 µL of 2 M lithium hydroxide. The solution can be gently heated using a heat block at 40-60 °C to encourage dissolution. The resulting lithium I3C solution should be brown and has a concentration of 1 M.\n\tCAUTION: Lithium hydroxide is corrosive. Safety glasses, gloves and a lab coat should be worn.\nMeasure the pH of the solution. If necessary, add small amounts of 1 M hydrochloric acid or 2 M lithium hydroxide to adjust the pH to between 7 and 8. Add milliQ water to make the final solution volume to 400 µL. The concentration of the I3C stock solution is 0.5 M.\n\tNOTE: Step 2.3 is optional. The pH of the solution should be between pH 7-8 prior to any pH adjustment. This step should be performed if the protein of interest is strongly affected by pH. The protocol can be paused here. Lithium I3C can be kept in the dark at 4 °C for at least two weeks35.\n3. Addition of I3C to the protein stock\nMethod 1\n\t\nAdd stock lithium I3C to a 150 µL aliquot of the target protein. The final concentration should be between 5-40 mM lithium I3C.\nMethod 2 (gentler method)\n\t\nPrepare a protein dilution buffer that matches the buffer of the target protein. To this dilution buffer, add stock lithium I3C to give a concentration of lithium I3C between 10-80 mM.",
    "Dilute the protein 1:1 with protein dilution buffer to give a final concentration of lithium I3C between 5-40 mM.\n\t\tNOTE: Some proteins will precipitate upon coming into contact with high concentrations of lithium I3C in method 1, while other proteins can tolerate it. Method 2 reduces the likelihood of precipitation. However, this method halves the protein concentration. For proteins that do not have an established crystallization protocol, a protein concentration of 10 mg/mL is generally recommended for initial crystallization screening. An initial molar ratio of I3C to protein of 8 is recommended. Protein concentration and molar ratio of I3C to protein can be optimized after the initial screen.\n4. Making a seed stock\nMake a rounded probe for crushing crystals.\n\t\nWith a Bunsen burner on the blue flame, heat a Pasteur pipette towards its middle. Using a tweezer, pull the end of the Pasteur pipette to draw it out into a thin diameter of less than 0.3 mm.\nOnce the midsection is thin enough, hold that segment in the flame to separate the pipette at this point and round the end of the pipette to finish the glass probe.\n\t\tNOTE: Rounded probe crystal crushers are sold by third party vendors. These are an alternative to making rounded probes.\nPlace five 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes on ice.\nUnder a light microscope, examine the crystallization tray for a suitable condition to generate microcrystals. Ideally, good morphology large crystals are selected. However, this technique also works with poor morphology crystals, needles, plates, microcrystals and spherulites.\nOpen up the crystallization tray well. For 96 well crystallization trays sealed with plastic, use a scalpel to cut the plastic sealing the well. For hanging drop trays sealed with grease, the coverslip can be removed using tweezers and inverted onto an even surface.",
    "Transfer 70 µL of reservoir solution to a microcentrifuge tube and chill it on ice. To the other microcentrifuge tubes, add 90 µL of reservoir solution and return to ice to chill.\n\tNOTE: If the reservoir does not have enough volume or does not exist (in the case of microbatch under oil), create crystallization reservoir by mixing the appropriate reagents.\nAgitate the crystal in the drop using the crystal probe to thoroughly crush it up. The crystal needs to be completely crushed up which can be monitored under the microscope.\nRemove all the liquid from the drop and transfer it to the microcentrifuge tube with the reservoir solution. Mix and subsequently take 2 µL of mixture from the microcentrifuge tube and add it back to the well. Rinse the well with the solution and transfer it to the microcentrifuge tube. Repeat this rinse step once more. From this point on, keep the microcentrifuge tube cold to avoid melting the microseeds in the mixture.\nVortex the tube at maximum speed at 4 °C for 3 min, stopping regularly to chill the tube on ice to prevent overheating.\n\tNOTE: Some microseeding protocols add a polytetrafluoroethylene seed bead to the microcentrifuge tube to aid crystal crushing7,36. We have employed the technique without the use of a seed bead with success, but see no problems with utilizing a seed bead to crush up crystals.\nMake a 1 in 10 serial dilution of the seed stock by sequentially transferring 10 µL between the chilled reservoir solutions.\nStore seed stocks that will not be used immediately at -80 °C.\n5. Setting up an rMMS screen\nSetting up a 96 well screening plate using a liquid dispensing robot. In the absence of a robot, a multichannel pipette may also be used.",
    "Transfer 75 µL from a deep well block to a 96 well crystallization tray. Add 1 µL to the crystallization drop and 74 µL to the reservoir.\nTransfer 1 µL of protein supplemented with lithium I3C, made in step 2, to the crystallization drop.\nTransfer 0.1 µL of seed stock to the crystallization drop.\nSeal the plate with clear sealing tape and incubate the plate at a constant temperature to allow crystal growth.\nSetting up a hanging drop screens\n\t\nGrease the edges of the hanging drop wells (hanging drop crystallization trays can be found in 24 and 48 well formats).\nTransfer 500 µL crystallization solution into reservoir.\nNear the center of a glass cover slide, place a 1 µL drop of protein supplemented with lithium I3C, made in step 2.\nAdd 1 µL of the crystallization solution to the drop.\nTransfer 0.1 µL of seed stock to the crystallization drop.\nInvert the cover slide and seal the crystallization well by pushing the cover slide into the grease.\nIncubate the plate at a constant temperature to allow crystal growth.\n\t\tNOTE: With new and untested seed stocks, it is recommended to use the most concentrated seed stock to maximize the chances of getting crystallization hits. Subsequent conditions can be set up with reduced seed concentration to optimize the number of crystals.\nInspect crystal trays under a microscope regularly for crystal growth. If crystals are of sufficient quality, they can be harvested for data collection. Crystals can also be used to generate new seed stocks and new rMMS screens to allow for iterative optimization.\n6. Data collection\nHarvest crystals using cryoloops, cryoprotect the crystals and flash cool them in liquid nitrogen. For additional information on flash cooling crystals, refer to Teng37 and Garman and Mitchell38.",
    "During the cryoprotection stage, if the crystal is passed through a new aqueous solution, I3C can be lost from the crystal due to it leeching into the cryoprotection solution. Use lithium I3C in the cryoprotection solution at a concentration that matches the crystallization condition to mitigate this.\nCrystals grown using this protocol have successfully been cryoprotected using Parabar 10312 oil based cryoprotectant (Hampton Research).\n\t\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here while crystals are stored in liquid nitrogen.\n\t\tCAUTION: Liquid nitrogen can cause cold burns. Liquid nitrogen can also cause asphyxiation if used in enclosed spaces.\nMount the crystal on the X-ray source goniometer and collect diffraction data using the protocol specific for the X-ray source.\nThis technique relies on anomalous signal from iodine atoms in I3C. Thus, select the energy of the X-ray to maximize this signal.\n\t\nSet synchrotron X-ray sources with tunable energies as low as possible. For many macromolecular crystallography beamlines, the lowest configurable energy is 8000 to 8500 eV.\nRotating anode X-ray sources cannot be tuned. Commonly used anode sources with copper have the Kα edge at 8046 eV, which provides a good anomalous signal for iodine (f\" = 6.9 e). Anode sources with chromium have a Kα edge at 5415 eV, which provides a large anomalous signal for iodine (f\" = 12.6 e).\nRadiation damage is a significant problem during data collection as it will degrade the anomalous signal39. Select the exposure time and attenuation of the beam to achieve the best diffraction while minimizing radiation dose.\n\tNOTE: In a similar phasing compound with the iodine atoms replaced with bromine atoms, radiation damage has been shown to cause the radiolysis of the carbon bromine bond and a reduction in the occupancy of the bromine atoms24.",
    "Use inverse beam SAD data collection as a collection strategy. The data is collected in wedges, with opposite wedges collected after each other. This allows Friedel pairs to be collected with an equivalent dose, resulting in an improved measurement of anomalous signal less affected by radiation damage. For example, an eight wedge strategy to collect 360° would involve collecting the data in the order of wedge 1 (0°-45°), wedge 2 (180°-225°), wedge 3 (46°-90°), wedge 4 (225°-270°), wedge 5 (90°-135°), wedge 6 (270°-315°), wedge 7 (135°-180°) and wedge 8 (315°-360°).\n\t\tNOTE: Continuous rotation is an alternative collection strategy to that of inverse beam data collection. For a recent comparison of the collection strategies, see Garcie-Bonte & Katona40.\n7. Data processing and structure solution\nPerform data reduction on the diffraction data using XDS41, with the aim of maximizing the anomalous signal. Data reduction input parameters are specific to the dataset and may require some trial and error. Here are some recommendations to start.\n\t\nSet FRIEDEL'S LAW=FALSE. Execute CORRECT twice, setting STRICT_ABSORPTION_CORRECT = TRUE and STRICT_ABSORPTION_CORRECT = FALSE. One run can have a higher anomalous signal than the other. Compare the anomalous signals between the runs using the 'Anomal Corr' and 'SigAno' disciplines in the output. This provides an indicator of data quality.\nRun SHELXC on the XDS_ASCII.HKL file for a more accurate indication of anomalous signal. The 'Ranom' discipline will give an indication of the anomalous signal at different resolutions.\nRun POINTLESS42 and AIMLESS43 to scale the data. In AIMLESS, set the parameter ANOMALOUS ON. If the GUI is used, select the option Separate anomalous pairs for outlier rejection and merging statistics. Testing different resolution cutoffs may be required to maximize anomalous signal.",
    "Solve the protein structure using Auto-Rickshaw automated crystal structure determination pipeline44. Auto-Rickshaw will attempt to solve the phase problem and build the crystal structure of the protein automatically with protein modelling and refinement software.\n\t\nFor proteins without a homology model template, run the SAD protocol of Auto-Rickshaw in Advanced Mode. Enter the required parameters.\n\t\t\nSelect PROTEIN as the molecule type.\nEnter the data collection wavelength in angstroms (Å).\nSelect \"I\" as substructure element to indicate iodine atoms was used.\nSelect \"i3c\" as substructure type to indicate I3C was the phasing molecule.\nSelect \"sub_direct\" as the substructure determination method. This method employs SHELXD32 to search for the substructure.\nSelect \"3\" as the number of expected substructure per monomer.\nEnter \"1\" as the resolution cutoff of substructure search. This allows Auto-Rickshaw to automatically determine a suitable resolution cutoff.\nEnter the number of residues in a single monomer, spacegroup of the dataset, and number of molecules in the asymmetric unit based on the Matthews coefficient.\nSelect the appropriate dissemination level of X-ray data that suits the needs. Selecting \"AutoRickshaw developers\" will allow Auto-Rickshaw developers to troubleshoot the run if problems arise.\nInput the anomalous data as an mtz file.\nInput the protein sequence as a seq, pir or txt file. A seq file can be generated in a text editor (such as Notepad++9 on Windows or nano in Linux). Create a new file, enter the primary sequence of the protein as one long line or separated by line breaks. Save the file with the .seq file extension.\nEnter an institutional email address.\nResults are delivered via a web-link sent to the email address provided.",
    "NOTE: AutoRickshaw is an automated pipeline that invokes various crystallography software packages to solve an X-ray crystal structure32,33,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58. If the Auto-Rickshaw run fails to solve the structure, other Auto-Rickshaw settings can be tested. The structure determination method can be changed to \"sub_phassade\" to use Phaser59 instead of SHELXD32. The number of expected substructure per monomer can be also increased or decreased.\nDuring the experimental phasing of the crystal structure, Auto-Rickshaw will attempt to position heavy atoms in the unit cell, creating a substructure. The equilateral triangle arrangement of iodine atoms in I3C presents an efficient way of validating the substructure. If step 6.3 fails, validating the substructure could aid in troubleshooting structure solution.\n\t\nDownload the list of heavy atom sites from the Auto-Rickshaw results page. It is a hyperlink called \"heavy atom sites\". This will download a text file with the heavy atom sites.\nChange the file extension of the file from .txt to .pdb.\nOpen the PDB file in Coot60. Turn on symmetry to see other heavy atoms from neighboring asymmetric units.\nMeasure the distances between the heavy atoms, including across asymmetric units. I3C will appear as an equilateral triangle with a side length of 6 angstroms. The presence of a triangle with these dimensions indicates the placements of those heavy atoms are correct."
