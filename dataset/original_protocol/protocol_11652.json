    "All zebrafish embryos used in this procedure were raised and bred following established IACUC protocols12. These protocols were approved by the University of Louisville.\nNOTE: The wild-type zebrafish strain, AB, and the bmp4st72;smad5b1100 double mutant line were used in this study. All the water used in this procedure was sterile reverse osmosis water. Confocal images were taken under a laser-scanning confocal microscope. The endoderm measurements were made using the measure tool in ImageJ. All the statistical analyses were performed using statistical software.\n1. Making the solutions and media\nBacterial media: Dissolve LB broth or agar as per the manufacturer's instructions, and autoclave. Before pouring the media into 100 mm Petri dishes, add either ampicillin (50 µg/mL), kanamycin (50 µg/mL), or an ampicillin/chloramphenicol combination (50 µg/mL and 30 µg/mL, respectively).\nTo make 20x embryo media stock, dissolve the following in 1 L of water: 17.5 g of NaCl, 0.75 g of KCl, 2.9 g of CaCl2, 0.41 g of K2HPO4, 0.142 g of Na2HPO4, and 4.9 g of MgSO4·7H2O. Filter-sterilize the stock solution using a 0.22 µm vacuum filtration system, and store at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: Ignore the white precipitate that forms; this will not impact the media.\nIn 19 L of water, dissolve 1.2 g of NaHCO3 and add 1 L of the 20x embryo media stock to generate the working embryo media solution, and maintain this solution at 28 °C.\nFor 2% phenol red solution, dissolve 20 mg of phenol red sodium salt in 1 mL of RNase-free water, and store at room temperature.\n2. Embryo injection molds\nTo make the agarose injection plate, dissolve agarose in the embryo media to a final concentration of 3% by heating to a boil.",
    "Pour 50 mL of agarose into 100 mm Petri dishes, and while the agarose is still liquid, gently place the injection mold in the agarose to prevent bubble formation under the mold.\nLet the agarose plates cool. Once the agarose is solid, remove the injection mold, and store at 4 °C until ready to use.\n3. Injection pipettes\nPull 1.0 mm (OD) capillaries containing a filament into needles using a vertical pipette puller with the solenoid set to 2.5 and the heating element set to 14.6.\n\tNOTE: Any heated puller will work if it pulls the capillaries into two needles cleanly and evenly, but the injection needles need to be pulled within 1 week of injecting the zebrafish embryos for consistent injection results.\n\t\nPlace the capillary in the puller, tighten the clamp at each end, and then activate the heating element.\nPull the capillaries to create two injection needles.\nRemove the capillaries from the puller, and store them in an empty Petri dish with a strip of modeling clay that acts as the needle holder.\n4. Transposase mRNA preparation\nLinearize the Tol2Kit plasmid containing transposase with a NotI restriction endonuclease by combining the following in a 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tube: 10 µL of transposase plasmid (150 ng/µL), 1.5 µL of restriction endonuclease reaction buffer, 0.3 µL of NotI endonuclease.\nFill the reaction up to 20 µL with RNase-free water, and then mix and digest at 37 °C overnight.\nStop the transposase digestion by adding 1 µL of 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0), 2 µL of 5 M NH4OAc, and 80 µL of 100% EtOH to the digestion reaction, and then mix and chill at −20 °C overnight.",
    "Centrifuge the solution at 14,000x g for 20 min at 4 °C, and then aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the DNA pellet in RNase-free water.\nDetermine the linear plasmid concentration in nanograms per microliter (ng/µL) using a fluorometer by first running 2 µL of an RNase-free water blank and then running 2 µL of the linearized plasmid.\n\tNOTE: The plasmid concentrations typically range between 100-200 ng/µL\nSet up the SP6 mRNA production by combining the following components in order in a 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tube: 10 µL of 2x NTP/CAP, 2 µL of 10x reaction buffer, 0.1-1 µg of linear DNA template, and 2 µL of SP6 enzyme mix.\nFill the reaction up to 20 µL with RNase-free water, and then mix and incubate at 37 °C for 2 h.\nAfter incubating for 2 h, add 1 µL of DNase, mix well, and incubate for an additional 15 min at 37 °C.\nTo stop the SP6 reaction, add 30 µL of LiCl precipitation solution to the reaction tube, and then mix and chill at −20 °C overnight.\nCentrifuge the solution at 14,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C to pellet the mRNA, and then aspirate the supernatant and wash the mRNA pellet with 1 mL of 80% EtOH (diluted with RNase-free water).\nCentrifuge the solution at 14,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C to pellet the mRNA, and then aspirate the supernatant. Allow the pellet to air dry.\nResuspend the mRNA pellet in 20 µL of RNase-free water, determine the mRNA concentration in nanograms per microliter (ng/µL) using a fluorometer as described in step 4.5 (should be at least 100 ng/µL), aliquot 100 ng of mRNA per tube for single use, and store at −80 °C.",
    "​NOTE: To make sure the mRNA is not degraded, 2 µL of mRNA can be quickly run on a DNA electrophoresis gel to confirm a single band at 1,950 bps.\n5. Multisite Gateway cloning to create entry vectors for transgenesis\nNOTE: This protocol is modified from Kwan et al.10, with the LR reaction written as a half-LR reaction and with a total volume of 5 µL. To generate new entry elements, BP reactions using 5', middle, and 3' donor vectors need to be used10,13.\nTo perform the reaction, gather 10 fmol each of p5E, pME, and p3E and 20 fmol of the destination vector (pDest).\n\tNOTE: Multisite LR recombination uses four different plasmid vectors: a 5' entry vector (p5E), a middle entry vector (pME), a 3' entry vector (p3E), and a destination vector (pDest), to generate a unique transgenic construct flanked by Tol2 repeats ready to be injected into zebrafish embryos.\n\t\nIdentify the size of all four vectors in base pairs from the plasmid source (Table 1, Tol2Kit Wiki page14 or Addgene11; see the Table of Materials).\n\t\tNOTE: For novel vectors, full plasmid sequencing via commercial sequencing companies can provide the exact plasmid size in bps.\nDetermine the concentration of all four vectors in nanograms per microliter (ng/µL) using a fluorometer, as described in step 4.5.\nUsing the weight of DNA as 660 g/mol and the plasmid size (in bps), calculate the total nanograms (ng) of plasmid needed to reach either 10 fmol (entry vectors) or 20 fmol (destination vector).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64679/64679eq01.jpg\n\t\tNOTE: The Mosimann lab at the University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus, has generated a freely available spreadsheet to calculate the amount of plasmid needed (in ng) and the volume (in µL) of the vectors needed in the LR reaction15.",
    "To generate the construct described below, sox17:EGFPCAAX, use the following vectors: a p5E vector containing the zebrafish sox17 promoter, which is 6,918 bp in size16; a pME vector containing the prenylated EGFP, which is 3,345 bp in size10; a p3E vector containing the SV40 late poly A signal sequence, which is 2,838 bp in size10; and the pDest, which is 5,883 bp in size10.\nUsing the plasmid concentration determined in step 5.1.2 and the amount in nanograms (ng) for each vector (step 5.1.3), calculate the total microliters (µL) of each plasmid needed to reach either 10 fmol (entry vectors) or 20 fmol (destination vector), and then divide this by two for use in the 5 µL half-LR reactions (all the values listed below are listed in Table 2).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64679/64679eq02v2.jpg\nTo generate 10 fmol of p5E-sox17, use 45.66 ng (at a concentration of 140.3 ng/µL) and dilute with sterile water by a factor of 4 to get 0.65 µL.\nTo generate 10 fmol of pME-EGFPCAAX, use 22.08 ng (at a concentration of 213.5 ng/µL) and dilute with sterile water by a factor of 10 to get 0.52 µL.\nTo generate 10 fmol of p3E-poly A, use 15.73 ng (at a concentration of 276.1 ng/µL) and dilute with sterile water by a factor of 20 to get 0.57 µL.\nFor 20 fmol of the destination vector, use 77.66 ng of pDest (at a concentration of 307.3 ng/µL) and dilute with sterile water by a factor of 5 to get 1.63 µL.\nTo set up a 5 µL half-LR reaction, combine the volumes of the p5E, pME, p3E, and pDest determined in step 5.3 in a 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, and then add sterile water to reach a total reaction volume of 4 µL.",
    "Vigorously vortex the LR enzyme mix 2x for 1 min each to ensure proper mixing, and then add 1 µL to the reaction and mix thoroughly.\nIncubate at 25 °C overnight (16+ h).\nStop the LR reaction by adding 0.5 µL of proteinase K (2 µg/µL), incubate at 37 °C for 10 min, and then cool to room temperature.\nTransform 3-4 µL of plasmid into thawed, chemically competent cells by adding the plasmid and letting the cells sit on ice for 25-30 min.\nWhile the cells sit on ice, warm two LB-ampicillin agar plates to room temperature.\nHeat-shock the cells in a 42°C water bath for precisely 30 s.\nAfter the heat shock, add 250 µL of antibiotic-free, rich liquid media to the cells, and incubate with shaking at 37 °C for 1.5 h.\nSpread 300 µL of bacteria on one ampicillin plate, and incubate at 37°C overnight.\nThe next morning, screen the colonies for the presence of two phenotypes, clear and opaque, pick the clear colonies (as described in Kwan et al.10) one at a time, inoculate the liquid culture, and then shake at 37 °C overnight.\n\tNOTE: Clear colonies almost always contain the correct LR colony (>85% of the time).\nUsing a commercial kit as per the manufacturer's instructions, perform a plasmid prep on each liquid culture, and diagnostically digest each plasmid to confirm the appropriate size of the transgenic construct, which indicates that the LR gateway reaction has worked properly.\nRe-transform the correct transgenic constructs using the standard bacterial transformation protocol as described in steps 5.4-5.12 using 0.5-1 µL of the plasmid, and only incubate at 37 °C for 1 h.\nRe-streak the colonies, and confirm that each has the LR transgenic construct as in step 5.14.",
    "Determine the plasmid concentration as described in step 4.5 (at least 150 ng/µL is needed for the embryo injection).\n6. Injection of the transgene into the embryos\nThaw a single-use transposase mRNA sample and Tol2 transgenic construct on ice and prewarn an agarose injection plate to room temperature.\nCombine the following on ice: 150 ng of plasmid, 100 ng of transposase mRNA, and 2% phenol red (0.3 µL). Then, add RNA-free water to make up the volume to 3 µL.\nTransfer one cell-stage embryos using transfer pipettes to the injection plate (described in step 2) filled with EM completely covering the agar, and then gently press approximately 50-75 embryos per slot of the injection plate.\nAdd the mRNA/plasmid/phenol red mixture to the open end of a capillary injection needle, place the capillary needle in the injection rig armature, and turn on the injection rig.\n\tNOTE:The injection rig uses compressed gas, such as air, to pulse the desired volume (described in step 6.5) of the mRNA/plasmid/phenol red mixture into the embryo when activated.\nLower the capillary needle into the EM of the injection plate, and break the tip using forceps to allow only a small amount of mRNA/plasmid/phenol red mixture to be pumped out by the injection rig.\nInject the embryos with a small 3 nL bolus of the mRNA/plasmid/phenol red mixture into the cell body of the embryo.\n\tNOTE: A 3 nL bolus is a volume of mRNA/plasmid/phenol red mixture at which seven boluses can theoretically fit equally across the midline of the embryo.\nWhen finished injecting the embryos, remove them from the injection plate by gently popping them out of the slot and transfer-pipetting them to a 100 mm Petri dish with fresh EM (approximately 40 mL), and then incubate at 28.5 °C to allow the embryos to develop.",
    "7. Screening embryos for transgenic insertion\nFor the expression of fluorescent proteins, pick the appropriate developmental stage when the fluorescent transgene should be expressed, and screen for the presence of fluorescence under a fluorescent dissecting microscope.\n\tNOTE: These embryos will be mosaic in their expression and show a genomic insertion of the transgenic construct.\nScreen for non-fluorescent transgenes by screening for a fluorescent transgenic marker (as described in step 7.1), such as GFP driven by the cardiac-specific promoter for the gene cmlc2 or mCherry driven by the lens-specific promoter of αcyrstallin, which are contained in distinct destination vectors.\nAllow the embryos positive for transgenic insertion to fully develop to the adult zebrafish stages.\nOnce potential transgenic fish reach breeding age, screen them individually for both germline transmission and transgene expressivity by breeding them to wild-type zebrafish.\nThose adults whose embryos develop normally and give the strongest and most appropriate transgene expression are kept as unique transgenic zebrafish lines for future work and analyses.\n\tNOTE: As an alternative approach to screening for the genomic insertion of transgenic constructs, design PCR primers that only amplify the transgenic construct and not wild-type DNA.\nSubscription Required.
