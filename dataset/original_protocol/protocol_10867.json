    "1. Mica preparation: \nCut the mica (Electron Microscopy Sciences) with scissors to the size necessary to fit the AFM microscope (approx. 22 × 30 mm).  \nCleave the mica on both sides, generally using tape to remove the outer layer, until only smooth unbroken layers remain.  \n2. Preparation of gelatin solution:  \nAdd 100 ml of distilled water to a laboratory bottle. \nHeat the bottle in a microwave until the water begins to boil. (If a microwave is not available, the water can be heated in a beaker on a hot plate.)\nWeigh out 0.5 grams of the gelatin (Sigma G-6144, G-2625 or G-2500) and add to the hot distilled water.\nGently swirl the bottle until the gelatin is completely dissolved. \nCool the gelatin solution to 60-70 °C.\nPour approximately 15 mL into a small beaker (20 mL) into which the cut cleaved mica can be dipped.\n3. Mica coating:  \nSubmerge the mica squares into the warmed gelatin solution and withdraw quickly such that the mica is coated (Fig. 1a). \nAfter coating, support the mica immediately, on edge, on a paper towel to dry in ambient air (Fig. 1b). The gelatin coated mica can be used for at least 2 weeks. The excess gelatin solution can be kept refrigerated and used for approximately a month by simply reheating the stock solution to between 60-70 °C.  Care must be taken to ensure that the gelatin is not boiled during reheating.\n4. Mounting bacteria on gelatin coated mica:\nPellet 1 mL of a bacterial culture (0.5 - 1.0 OD at 600 nm) at 800 to 4,500 rcf. Depending on the bacteria, use the minimum rcf that will pellet the cells in ˜ 5 minutes.\nWash the pellet in the same volume of filtered deionized water or buffer. \nCollect the cells again by centrifugation.",
    "Resuspend the pellet promptly in 500 μL of nanopure deionized water or buffer.  (The bacterial suspension should be visibly turbid in order to have an adequate concentration of cells for AFM imaging.)\nApply the cell suspension (10-20 μL) to the gelatin-coated mica and spread on the surface using a pipette tip (Fig. 1c). Care should be taken to not physically touch the gelatin surface with the pipette tip while applying or spreading the bacterial solution. \nAllow the surface to rest for 10 minutes and rinse with a stream of water or buffer (Fig 1 c-d).  Throughout the procedure, take care to ensure that the sample is not allowed to dry.\n5. Representative Results:\nFigure 2 shows example images of bacterial cells that have been mounted on gelatin-coated mica and imaged by AFM. In our laboratories, samples are typically imaged using a PicoPlus atomic force microscope (Agilent Technologies, Temple, AZ) outfitted with a 100 μm scanning head. The instrument is operated at 128-512 pixels per line scan at a scan speed of 0.5-1.0 lines/s. The cantilevers that are typically used are Veeco silicon nitride probes (MLCT-AUHW, Veeco, Santa Barbara, CA) with nominal spring constants ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 nN/nm.",

Using a pair of tweezers freshly cleaved mica squares are totally immersed into the gelatin (a) withdrawn and placed upright on a paper towel leaning against a micro centrifuge rack (b). A droplet of bacterial sample is placed on the mica and spread with a pipet tip in both the X and Y directions (c). After allowing the sample to incubate on the mica surface for at least 10 minutes, rinse the sample in a stream of distilled water. If the immobilization worked you will be able to see an opaque spot on the mica as shown in the right panel of (d). If the immobilization did not work you will get a clear piece of mica as in the left panel. The opaque spot on the mica scales to the concentration of the bacteria in the droplet that you place on the gelatin treated mica.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2880/2880fig2.jpgFigure 2. AFM images of E. coli.  In panel (a), the cells are mounted on gelatin-coated mica and imaged in 0.005 M PBS. For comparison, an image of bacterial cells mounted on gelatin-coated mica and imaged in air is shown in panel (b).  Though septa are clearly visible in image collected in liquid, greater resolution, as indicated by the presence of pili (inset panel (b)), can be obtained in air. Subscription Required.
