    "CAUTION: Always consult all relevant material safety data sheets (MSDS) before use. Use all appropriate safety practices and personal protective equipment (safety glasses, gloves, lab coat, full length pants, closed-toe shoes). Perform all biological reactions in the biological fume hood.\nNOTE: This protocol is intended to produce 2 x 1010 biofunctionalized NWs/mL equivalent to 0.36 mg of iron/mL coated with anti-CD44 antibodies with a density of 3 x 104 antibodies/NW. The iron-iron oxide (core-shell) NWs are 2.5 µm long and have a diameter of 41.5 nm.\n1. Release of iron nanowires\nNOTE: The fabrication process of the iron/iron oxide NWs was explained in detail in a previous publication59.\nOn a cutting mat, cut the aluminum (Al) discs (Figure 2A) into small pieces (Figure 2B) using a single edge blade and a small hammer to fit into a 2 mL tube. Use tweezers to transfer the small Al pieces to the tube.\nFill the 2 mL tube, containing the small Al pieces, with 1 mL of 1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Make sure all the Al pieces are covered with the NaOH.\nLeave the solution working for 30 min at room temperature inside of a chemical fume hood.\nRemove only the Al pieces using the tweezer and keep the released NWs (black clusters, Figure 3A) in the NaOH solution for an additional 30 min. Do not change the NaOH solution.\nCollect the NWs by placing the 2 mL tube in a magnetic rack and wait for 2 min before removing the old 1 M NaOH solution. Replace it with fresh NaOH solution.\nSonicate the 2 mL tube containing the NWs for 30 s and leave it for 1 h inside a chemical fume hood.\nRepeat steps 1.5-1.6 at least four times.",
    "Wash the NWs by placing the 2 mL tube in the magnetic rack and wait for 2 min.\nDiscard the NaOH solution and replace it with 1 mL of absolute ethanol.\nSonicate the tube for 30 s.\nPlace the 2 mL tube in the magnetic rack and wait 2 min.\nDiscard the old absolute ethanol solution and replace it with 1 mL of fresh absolute ethanol and sonicate for 30 s.\nRepeat step 1.11 and 1.12 for at least four times.\nKeep the NWs in 1 mL of absolute ethanol at room temperature until they are needed.\nMeasure the concentration of iron and hence the NWs by using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here. However, for long-time storage, do not release the NWs from the Al template until needed. Keeping the released NWs precipitating in the ethanol for a long time without frequent sonication will create aggregations that will need longer times of sonication to be separated.\n2. Coating the nanowires with APTES\nNOTE: In this protocol, 100 µL of APTES solution (density of 0.946 g/mL61) is enough to coat 1.6 x 107 m2/g of NWs. If there is a change in the ratio or the mass of the nanomaterial, the APTES volume should be adjusted accordingly.\nTransfer the NWs from step 1.14 to a 5 mL glass tube using a 1 mL pipette.\nTo collect any NWs left in the 2 mL tube, wash the empty 2 mL tube twice by adding 1 mL of absolute ethanol and transfer it to the 5 mL glass tube using a 1 mL pipette.\nBy using the pipette, take 100 µL of APTES and add it to the NW solution directly.\nVortex the 5 mL glass tube for 10 s.",
    "Adjust the 5 mL glass tube on the clamp of a laboratory retort stand.\nPlace half of the 5 mL glass tube inside of the water of the ultrasonic bath and sonicate for 1 h.\nTake out the 5 mL glass tube from the ultrasonic bath and add 400 µL of deionized (DI) water followed by 20 µL of 1 M NaOH (basic catalysis).\n\tCAUTION: It is important to add the DI water first.\nAdjust the 5 mL glass tube, as explained in steps 2.5-2.6, and sonicate for another 1 h.\nTake out the 5 mL glass tube from the ultrasonic bath.\nPlace a magnet next to the glass tube for 5 min to collect the NWs.\nReplace the supernatant with 1 mL of fresh absolute ethanol and sonicate for 10 s.\nRepeat steps 2.10-2.11 four times.\nTransfer all NWs suspended ethanol to a new 5 mL glass tube using a 1 mL pipette.\n\tNOTE: The APTES coated NWs can be stored in a glass tube with ethanol until they are needed. The protocol can be paused here.\n3. Biofunctionalization of the nanowires\nActivating the antibodies\n\tNOTE: To achieve approximately 3 x 104 parts of antibody/NW, use 30 µL of antibody (1 mg/mL) per 0.1 mg of iron.\n\t\nIn a 2 mL tube, dissolve 0.4 mg of 3-3-dimethyl-aminopropyl carbodiimide (EDC) and 1.1 mg of sulfo-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (Sulfo-NHS) in 1 mL of 2-N-morpholino ethanesulfonic acid hydrate (MES) (pH 4.7).\n\t\tNOTE: The EDC/sulfo-NHS mixture should be fresh and prepared before using.\nIn a new 2 mL tube, add 30 µL of anti-CD44 antibody (1 mg/mL), 960 µL of 0.1 M of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7), and 10 µL of EDC/sulfo-NHS mixture (prepared in step 3.1.1), respectively.",
    "Place the 2 mL tube in a tube shaker at 10 x g for 15 min at room temperature.\nPreparation of the APTES coated nanowires\n\t\nDuring the 15 min incubation in step 3.1.3, wash the NWs by placing a magnet next to the APTES coated NWs tube (from step 2.13) for 2 min to collect the NWs.\nDiscard the ethanol and replace it with 1 mL of 0.1 M PBS (pH 7), and then sonicate for 10 s.\nRepeat step 3.2.1-3.2.2 four times.\nCollect the NWs, as explained in step 3.2.1, and discard the 0.1 M PBS. Keep the NWs in the tube without any solution.\nAttachment of the antibodies\n\t\nTransfer all the activated antibody solution (prepared in step 3.1.3) to the NWs tube (prepared in 3.2.4) and sonicate for 10 s.\nPlace the glass tube in the rotator overnight at 4 °C.\nCollect the NWs using a magnet as in step 3.2.1 and discard the supernatant.\nAdding 1 mL of 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution for 1 h at 4 °C to block the reaction.\nCheck the antigenicity of the antibody functionalized NWs, for example, using immunoprecipitation (IP) and western blot (WB) assays.\n\t\tNOTE: For better results, use the biofunctionalized NWs in the IP, WB, or biocompatibility assay immediately after the blocking step.\n4. Biocompatibility assay\nNOTE: To study the biocompatibility of the NWs, various cell viability assays and different cell lines can be employed. The concentration of the NWs used here is based on a previous publication16. The cell seeding should be done one day before the NW biofunctionalization.\nCAUTION: All the below steps should be done under the biosafety cabinet.",
    "In a 96-well plate, seed nine wells with 4 x 104 of colon cancer cells (HCT116 cell line) suspended in McCoy’s cell culture media (100 µL/well) and place it inside the incubator overnight at 37 °C and 5% carbon dioxide (CO2).\nWash the NWs (from step 3.3.4) with PBS by collecting them using a magnet as in step 3.2.1 and replace the old solution with 1 mL of 0.01 M PBS (pH 7). Repeat this step three times.\nWash the NWs (from step 4.2) with warmed McCoy’s media by collecting them using a magnet as in step 3.2.1 and replace the old PBS with 1 mL of warmed McCoy’s media. Repeat this step three times.\nCollecting the NWs (from step 4.3) using a magnet as in step 3.2.1 and replace the 1 mL of warmed McCoy’s media with 900 µL of warmed McCoy’s media. The NWs concentration should be 0.02 mg of NWs per mL.\nTake the 96-well plate (from step 4.1) from the incubator to the biosafety cabinet.\nUnder the biosafety cabinet, discard the old media from the cells and replace it with 100 µL of suspended NWs (prepared in step 4.4).\nShake the plate (prepared in step 4.6) by hand and then incubate it for 24 h inside the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nThe next day, take out the 96-well plate (prepared in step 4.7) from the incubator. Under the biosafety cabinet, add 11 µL of the cell viability reagent (Table of Materials) to each well using the multiwall pipette.\nShake the plate with the plate shaker at a speed of 10 x g for 10 s.\nIncubate the plate for 1 h in the incubator.",
    "Take out the 96-well plate (prepared in step 4.10) from the incubator. Read the plate in the microplate reader (Table of Materials) by measuring the absorbance of the cell viability reagent (excitation 540 nm, emission 590 nm)."
