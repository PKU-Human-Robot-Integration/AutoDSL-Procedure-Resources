    "This protocol was performed according to Lund University's human research ethics committee guidelines and should be done in accordance with individual institutional guidelines.\n1. Reagent Preparation\nFor Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), mix high glucose DMEM containing sodium pyruvate with 20% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin (pen/strep), 1% L-glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids and 10-4-M 2-mercaptoethanol.\nFor complete DMEM, mix high glucose DMEM containing sodium pyruvate with 10% FBS, 1% Pen/strep and 1% L-glutamine.\nFor hematopoietic medium, mix hematopoietic medium (Table of Materials) with 10-6 M hydrocortisone and 1% pen/strep.\nUse phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) without calcium or magnesium.\n2. Human Dermal Fibroblast Isolation\nNOTE: HDFs can be purchased from certified suppliers (Table of Materials). In that case, expand fibroblasts and use them directly in reprogramming experiments (section 4). Alternatively, HDFs can be isolated from donors. If fibroblasts are isolated from different donors, keep the samples separated from each other at all steps of the protocol. Label plates/wells and collection tubes with the identification number of each donor.\nObtain HDFs from 3 mm round skin punch biopsies performed by qualified physicians.\nCoat three wells of a tissue culture-treated 6-well plate with 500 μL of 0.1% gelatin and incubate for 20 min at 37 °C.\nAspirate the remaining gelatin solution and add 750 μL of DMEM/20% FBS to each well. The entire surface of the well should be covered with medium.\nAdd 1.5 mL of DMEM/20% FBS to the inside surface of a sterile 100 mm petri dish lid and spread the drop with the aid of a 5 mL serological pipette.\nPlace the skin biopsy in the medium on the lid with sterilized forceps.\nDissect the skin biopsy into nine identical sections, using one sterilized scalpel to hold the biopsy in place and a second scalpel to cut.",
    "Place three biopsy pieces per well using pointed forceps. Make sure the pieces attach to the bottom of the well.\nLay a 22 mm coverslip on top of the pieces and apply some pressure.\nIncubate the plate at 37 °C, 5% CO2, for a week. Check cells daily and add 200 μL of DMEM/20% FBS every 2 days to replace evaporated medium.\nAfter one week, add up to 2 mL of DMEM/20% FBS and replace medium every 2−3 days.\nPassage cells at 1:4 ratio when wells are confluent (about 4−8 weeks).\nPrepare 0.1% gelatin coated tissue culture-treated 6-well plates.\nAspirate medium from wells at 80% confluency and wash once with 1 mL of PBS.\nRemove coverslip with sterile forceps and place the coverslip into a new well of a 6-well plate, with the tissue side up.\nNOTE: Cells that remained attached to the coverslip will also be harvested.\nAdd 500 μL of dissociation solution (Table of Materials) per well (including wells with the coverslips) and incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 5−10 min. Check when cells start to rise from the bottom of the well and inactivate the dissociation solution by adding 500 μL of DMEM/20% FBS to each well.\nCollect fibroblasts from all the wells into a 15 mL conical tube. Add extra medium to the wells to collect the remaining cells. Centrifuge the tube at 350 x g for 5 min.\nIn the meantime, add 500 μL of DMEM/20% FBS to each well of previously gelatin coated plates.\nAspirate medium and resuspend fibroblasts in 6 mL of DMEM/20% FBS.\nAdd 500 μL of fibroblast suspension to each well (two 6-well plates per sample/donor in total). Incubate cells overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2.",
    "On the next day, add 1 mL of DMEM/20% FBS to each well. Replace medium with 2 mL of DMEM/20% FBS every 2−3 days until wells are 80% confluent.\nRepeat section 2.11 for three confluent wells until third passage is reached.\nFreeze fibroblasts from confluent wells (passages 1 and 3).\nAspirate medium from the wells and wash once with 1 mL of PBS.\nDissociate and collect fibroblasts as described in steps 2.11.4 and 2.11.5.\nCount cells with a hemocytometer and centrifuge the tube at 350 x g for 5 min.\nAfter centrifugation, aspirate medium and resuspend fibroblasts in FBS with 10% DMSO at a density of 5 x 105 cells/mL.\nAdd 1 mL of the cell suspension per cryovial and freeze cells overnight at -80 °C using a freezing container. Move vials to -150 °C (liquid nitrogen) for long-term storage.\n3. Lentiviral Production\nGrow HEK293T cells in a 100 mm tissue culture-treated dish with 10 mL of complete DMEM, at 37 °C, 5% CO2, until confluency is reached.\nOn the day prior to transfection, aspirate medium and wash the dish carefully with 5 mL of PBS.\nAfter removing PBS, add 1.5 mL of dissociation solution and incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 5−10 min to dissociate cells from the dish.\nNOTE: It is recommended to warm both PBS and dissociation solution before using, so that cells do not suffer a thermal shock.\nInactivate dissociation solution with 3 mL of complete DMEM and transfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL conical tube. Wash the dish with 5 mL of complete DMEM to remove remaining attached cells and transfer this volume to the 15 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 350 x g for 5 min.",
    "Aspirate supernatant and split the cell pellet evenly between six 100 mm tissue culture-treated dishes in a final volume of 10 mL of complete DMEM per dish. Cells should be approximately 60% confluent by the time of transfection.\nOn the next day, transfect cells with the plasmid mixes as follows:\n\tNOTE: This part of the protocol describes the production of lentiviruses in one 100 mm tissue culture-treated dish per plasmid mix. To obtain higher volumes of lentiviral supernatant for concentration, use at least four 100 mm HEK293T cell culture dishes per mix.\n\t\nIn a 15 mL conical tube, add 10 μg of the three transfer plasmids together: 3.33 μg of pFUW-tetO-GATA2 (Addgene plasmid #125028)14, 3.33 μg of pFUW-tetO-GFI1B (Addgene #125597)14 and 3.33 μg of pFUW-tetO-FOS (Addgene #125598)14, plus 10 μg of the 2nd generation psPAX2 packaging vector encoding the Gag, Pol, Tat and Rev genes (Addgene #12260) and 5 μg of pMD2.G envelope vector encoding the VSV-G gene (Addgene #12259). Add water up to 500 μL.\nIn two new 15 mL conical tubes add 10 μg of FUW-M2rtTA plasmid (Addgene #20342)17, 10 μg of psPAX2 packaging vector and 5 μg of pMD2.G envelope vector to each tube. Add water up to 500 μL. One tube is going to be used as a control.\nTo each tube add 62.5 μL of 2 M CaCl2. Next, release bubbles into each mixture using a Pasteur pipet inserted into a pipet controller. While bubbles are forming, pipette 500 μL of N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (BES) buffered saline (pH 7.1, 25 °C), with a P1000 pipette, drop-wise against the Pasteur pipet and onto the mixture.\nIncubate tubes at room temperature for at least 15 min. The mixtures will appear slightly cloudy after some time.",
    "Meanwhile, aspirate medium from HEK293T cell dishes (passaged the day before) and add 10 mL of complete DMEM without antibiotics. Be careful and add medium slowly as HEK293T cells are semi-adherent.\nDistribute each individual mixture (approximately 1 mL) evenly and drop-wise into separate dishes and incubate overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nReplace medium with 4 mL of complete DMEM, 24 h after incubation. Incubate overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2. If available, incubate instead at 32 °C, 5% CO2, as the reduced temperature will increase the half-life of the lentiviral particles.\nCollect supernatant with lentiviral particles three times to a 50 mL conical tube. Do not mix different lentiviral particles at this point. Each dish will result in 12 mL of lentiviral supernatant. Four dishes of the same viral preparation fit into one 50 mL conical tube.\n\tCAUTION: Perform lentiviral collection in a biosafety level-2 laboratory in a laminar flow hood dedicated for lentiviral work and place viral contaminated waste (tubes, tips, dishes) in an appropriate container for biohazardous materials.\n\t\nDo the first collection 16 h after the last incubation and add 4 mL of complete DMEM. Incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nDo the second collection 8 h after the first to the same tube, add 4 mL of complete DMEM and incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nDo the third collection 16 h after the second to the same tube and discard the dishes.\nNOTE: Store lentiviral supernatants at 4 °C after each collection.\nFilter each lentiviral supernatant using a 0.45 μm low-protein binding filter with a cellulose acetate membrane (Table of Materials) to a clean tube.",
    "Add a maximum of 15 mL of filtered supernatant to a centrifugal filter unit with a regenerated cellulose membrane (Table of Materials) and spin at 4,000 x g for 25 min, at 4 °C. Discard flow-through. A viscous liquid containing lentiviruses will remain in the filter unit.\nRepeat step 3.13 by adding 15 mL of supernatant on top of the filter unit, until there is no more lentiviral supernatant left.\nNOTE: When there are only a few milliliters of supernatant to concentrate, decrease the spinning time to 10 min. If there is still extra liquid (non-viscous) on the filter, centrifuge for an additional 10 min.\nMake aliquots (50−200 μL depending on the initial supernatant volume) of each type of concentrated lentiviruses and store at -80 °C for long-term storage (1−2 years) or at 4 °C for short-term storage (1−2 weeks).\nNOTE: Concentrated or non-concentrated lentiviruses can also be used fresh. Do not re-freeze and thaw as this results in reduced titer.\n4. Hemogenic Reprogramming\nNOTE: Use HDFs with a passage number of three (P3) or higher (until P10) to perform reprogramming experiments.\nCoat a 100 mm tissue culture-treated dish with 5 mL of 0.1% gelatin and incubate at 37 °C for 20 min. Aspirate the remaining gelatin solution.\nThaw a fibroblast vial and plate cells in the 0.1% gelatin-coated dish. Incubate overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2. If necessary, expand fibroblasts for a longer period of time until the desired passage and confluency are reached.\nCoat a 6-well tissue culture-treated plate with 500 μL of 0.1% gelatin solution and incubate at 37 °C for 20 min. Remove extra gelatin.",
    "Plate HDFs at a density of 150,000 cells per plate (25,000 cells per well) in 2 mL of complete DMEM per well. Incubate overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2, to allow cell attachment.\nReplace medium with 2 mL of complete DMEM plus 8 μg/mL polybrene. Prepare a 1:1 ratio mix of pool-produced TF lentiviruses and M2rtTA in a new microcentrifuge tube.\nNOTE: In this protocol, pool-production of lentiviruses for the three TFs is performed, which, in authors' hands, results in higher reprogramming efficiency. Alternatively, it is suggested to perform a titration of the individual lentiviral particles by qPCR18, on a standard cell line. This will be used to define the volume of individual viruses necessary to meet a multiplicity of infection (MOI) optimal for co-transduction and hemogenic reprogramming.\nDistribute 10 to 100 μL of lentiviral mixture per well, to transduce HDFs. This is day -2 of reprogramming.\nNOTE: Defining the optimal volume of lentiviral mix for efficient reprogramming, without compromising cell viability, requires optimization (see Supplementary Figure 1 for more details). HDFs with more than 7 passages may require higher volumes of viruses than cells with lower passages.\nAfter 16 h of incubation, remove viruses and add complete DMEM. Allow cells to recover for 6−8 h.\nAfter recovery, aspirate medium and add 2 mL of complete DMEM with 8 μg/mL polybrene.\nDo a second transduction as described in step 4.6 and incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 16 h. This is day -1 of reprogramming. The lentiviral mix can be prepared on day -2 for both transductions and kept at 4 °C.\nOn the next day, remove the viruses and add complete DMEM supplemented with 1 μg/mL DOX. This is day 0 of reprogramming. Incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 48 h.",
    "At day 2 of reprogramming, split each well at 1:2 ratio.\nAspirate medium and wash cells with 1 mL of PBS.\nAspirate PBS and dissociate cells with 500 μL of dissociation solution. Incubate 5−10 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nInactivate the dissociation solution with 1 mL of complete DMEM and collect cells into a conical tube. Centrifuge at 350 x g for 5 min.\nResuspend the pellet in hematopoietic medium (see step 1.3), supplemented with 1 μg/mL DOX, and plate cells into new tissue culture-treated 6-well plates coated with 0.1% gelatin to a final volume of 2 mL per well.\nChange medium (hematopoietic medium plus DOX) twice a week for the duration of the reprogramming cultures (25 days).\nAnalyze resulting reprogrammed cells at different time points by brightfield or fluorescence microscopy (see Supplementary Figure 2), flow cytometry, bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing, and transplantation assays for the acquisition of hematopoietic morphology, presence of endothelial and hematopoietic markers, acquisition of endothelial/hematopoietic gene expression profile and regeneration capacity14.\n5. Optimization of Fibroblast Expansion for ChIP-seq Analysis at the Onset of Hemogenic Reprogramming\nPlate 300,000 HDFs (<P8) in 0.1% gelatin coated tissue culture-treated 6-well plates with complete DMEM to a final volume of 2 mL per well. Incubate overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nOn the following day, replace medium with complete DMEM supplemented with 8 μg/mL polybrene.\nTransduce cells with individual factors: pFUW-tetO-FOS14, pLV-tetO-HA-GFI1B (Addgene #125599)14 and pFUW-tetO-3xFLAG-GATA2 (Addgene #125600)14 or with a pool of the three factors, plus FUW-M2rtTA at 1:1 ratio. Use 10−20 μL total virus (individual TF + M2rtTA or three TFs + M2rtTA). Incubate cells overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nNOTE: It is recommended to use twelve 6-well plates per condition (for each individual TF and the three TFs combined).",
    "Remove lentiviruses and add complete DMEM 16 h after the first transduction. Let cells recover for 6−8 h.\nTransduce cells a second time with the same amount of virus per condition and incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nOn the next day remove viruses and add complete DMEM. Incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nRe-plate each well into a 0.1% gelatin coated tissue culture-treated 100 mm dish with complete DMEM to a final volume of 10 mL per dish. This represents approximately a 1:6 passage.\nAllow cells to grow for 6 days at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nOn day 6 after re-plating, aspirate medium and add complete DMEM with 1 μg/mL DOX. Incubate cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 2 days.\nCollect fibroblasts and analyze genomic binding sites of the three TFs transduced individually or in combination, by ChIP-seq 2 days after DOX supplementation14.\nNOTE: The final seventy-two 100 mm dishes will contain between 20−50 x 106 cells, sufficient to perform ChIP-seq experiments and replicates."
