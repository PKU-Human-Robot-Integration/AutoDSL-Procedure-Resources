    "1. Platform for Implementation of Neural Control of Powered Transfemoral Prostheses\nAn engineering platform was developed in this study to implement and evaluate neural control of powered artificial legs. The hardware included a desktop PC with 2.8 GHz CPU and 4 GB RAM, a multi-functional data acquisition board with both analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-analog converters (DACs), a motor controller, digital I/Os, and a prototypical powered transfemoral prosthesis designed in our group12. The analog sensor inputs were first digitized by the ADCs and streamed into the desktop PC for signal processing. The DAC was used for control output to drive the DC motor in prosthesis through a motor controller. Digital I/Os were used to enable/disable the motor controller. The powered prosthesis was tethered to the desktop PC and powered by a 24 V power supply.\nThe software was programmed in a development environment suitable for virtual instrumentation running on the desktop PC. The development environment was based on virtual instrumentation, which effectively combines both user-defined software and hardware to implement the customized platform. By using the structure of a graphical block diagram, different modular function nodes can be easily and efficiently implemented and updated. In order to demonstrate the function of platform for online control of powered artificial legs, preliminarily designed prosthesis control was implemented on this platform. The control system included a neural controller and an intrinsic controller. The neural controller consisted of our previous designed NMI based on neuromuscular-mechanical fusion, which recognized the user’s activity mode. The neural controller as a high-level controller was hierarchically connected with the intrinsic control for powered lower limb prosthesis control.",
    "The architecture of control software on the platform is illustrated in Figure 1. The NMI contains two parts: offline training module and online testing module. The offline training module was designed to collect training data and build the classifiers in NMI. The collected multichannel surface EMG signals and mechanical measurements were first preprocessed and segmented into continuous sliding windows. In each window, features which characterize the signal patterns were extracted and then fused into one feature vector. The feature vector in each window was labeled with activity modes (classes) and phase index based on the performing activities of prosthesis user and the states of prosthesis during the training data collection. The labeled feature vectors were then used to build a phase-dependent pattern classifier, which contains multiple sub-classifiers correlated with individually phases. The created classifier was saved and transferred to online testing module for later online evaluation.\nThe online testing module was used to online recognize user’s movement intent and switch the activity modes in intrinsic controller. The multichannel neuromuscular and mechanical measurements were simultaneously streamed into online testing module and transformed into feature vectors. Then the feature vectors were fed into the phase-dependent classifier which was already built in offline training module. Based on the current phase in intrinsic controller, the corresponding sub-classifier was switched on and used to recognize the user’s intent. The classification output was further post-processed and sent to intrinsic controller to switch activity modes.",
    "A finite-state machine (FSM) based impedance controller was implemented for the intrinsic control of powered artificial legs. The impedance controller generated desired torque output on the knee joints. The finite-state machine adjusted the joint impedance according to the current state of the performing activity. For locomotion activities (i.e. level-ground walking and ramp ascent/descent), the FSM consisted of five states corresponding to five gait phases: stance flexion (STF), stance extension (STE), pre-swing (PSW), swing flexion (SWF), and swing extension (SWE); for static standing, the FSM included two phases: weight bearing (WB) and non-weight bearing (NWB). Transitions between the states were triggered by the ground reaction force and knee joint position. The transition between activity modes was controlled by the output from the online testing module. For all three modules discussed above, graphical user interface (GUI) were built, which allowed experimenters in lab to easily adjust control parameters, monitor system performance, and conduct evaluation experiments.\n2. Experimental Setup\nSurface Electromyography (sEMG)\n\tSurface EMG signals from the thigh muscles of the amputee subject’s residual limb are recorded by a wireless EMG acquisition system. The targeted thigh muscles included the rectus femoris (RF), vastus laeralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), biceps femoris long (BFL), sartorius (SAR), semitendinosus (SEM), and adductor magnus (ADM). It is noteworthy that precisely targeting the specific muscle is not necessary8 because the used pattern recognition algorithm in NMI searches activation patterns of multiple muscles to recognize the activity mode. As long as the measured neuromuscular control information for hip and knee control is sufficient, cross-talks among EMG recordings have little impact on the NMI performance.\n\t\nAsk the subject to perform hip flexion/extension, hip adduction/abduction, and attempt to flex/extend the amputated knee joint when he is in standing position.",
    "Approximate and determine the locations of electrode placements by muscle palpation and examination of EMG recordings.\nEmbed the electrodes in a new designed EMG electrode-socket interface, as shown in Figure 2, for both the subject’s comfort and reliable electrode-skin contact. \nMechanical Measurements from Powered Prosthesis\n\tThe mechanical ground reaction forces and moments measured by a 6-DOF load cell from the prosthetic pylon are fused with EMG signals to recognize the subject’s movement intent. In addition, a potentiometer is instrumented on the knee joint to measure the knee joint angle and an encoder was connected to the DC motor to calculate knee angular velocity. These measurements are used as the feedback signals for intrinsic control.\n\t\nMount a six-degree-freedom load cell on the prosthetic pylon.\nAlign X-axis, Y-axis, and Z-axis of the load cell with the mediolateral direction, anteroposterior direction, and superoinferior direction of the prosthesis, respectively. \nLaboratory Environment Setup\n\tIn order to evaluate the neural control of powered artificial legs on transfemoral amputees, an obstacle course was built in the laboratory, as shown in Figure 3. The testing environment included a 5-m straight walkway, a 4-m long ramp with an inclination angle of 8°, and a level platform with the ramp securely attached. Along the ramp, hand railings were installed to enhance the safety of the subject. In addition, a ceiling rail system with a fall-arrest harness was provided to protect the subject from falling during the experiment.\n3. Experimental Protocol",
    "This study was conducted with the approval of Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the University of Rhode Island and with informed consent of the recruited subject. One male unilateral transfemoral amputee (cause of amputation: trauma; age: 57 years; duration of amputation: 32 years) was recruited in this study. The ratio between the length of the residual limb (measured from the ischial tuberosity to the distal end of the residual limb) to the length of the non-impaired side (measured from the ischial tuberosity to the femoral epicondyle) was 51%. The subject wears a microprocessor-controlled prosthetic knee through a suction suspension socket in his daily life. Prior to the experiment in this study, this subject received several training sessions led by a physical therapist in order to let the subject to adapt to the powered device and calibrate the desired impedance in each activity mode.\nSubject Preparation\n\t\nMeasure the subject’s weight, height, and record his gender and age.\nAsk the subject to put on his own shorts in a private preparation room.\nPut a size-fitted fall-arrest harness on the subject and attach it to the ceiling rail system. \nPreparation for EMG Recording\n\t\nSelect seven fully charged wireless EMG sensors and turn them on.\nPlace the EMG sensors into the customized suction socket at prepared locations. Write down the order number of the sensors and associate them with EMG locations.\nClean the skin of subject’s residual limb with isopropyl alcohol pads.\nAssist the subject in donning the suction socket and verify that the socket is firmly attached to subject’s residual limb.\nTurn on the real-time EMG analog data streaming software.\nAsk the subject to perform hip flexion/extension, hip adduction/abduction, and knee flexion/extension and examine EMG signals to verify EMG electrode contact and data transmission.\nAlignment and Initial Calibration of Powered Prosthetic Leg",
    "Instruct the subject to remain in a standing position while holding an assistive walker.\nAttach the powered prosthesis to the suction socket with a pyramid adaptor. Adjust a set of rotation screws on the adaptor until the position of the prosthesis is geometrically aligned with the socket. This procedure was performed by a prosthetist.\nAsk the subject to lift the prosthesis off the ground and calibrate the load cell on the prosthetic pylon.\nInstruct the subject to practice walking on different terrains (e.g., level-ground, ramp ascent, and ramp descent) when wearing the powered prosthetic leg. This procedure continues until the subject feels confident in walking with the powered device and yields consistent gait pattern in each activity performance. \nTraining Data Collection for Training the Classifiers in NMI\n\t\nInstruct the subject to stand on the starting location of a predefined walking path, as shown in Figure 3.\nTurn on the powered prosthesis and load the parameters into the intrinsic controller.\nRun a training data collection computer program and set the intrinsic control to standing mode by clicking the “Standing” button on the graphic user interface (GUI).\nBegin data collection by clicking the “Start Recording” button on GUI. Instruct the subject to stay in standing position for 5 sec.\nInstruct the subject to walk over level ground at his/her self-selected comfortable walking speed; at the same time, click the “Walking” button on the GUI before toe-off of the leading leg of the subject and set the intrinsic control to level-ground walking mode.",
    "When the subject was approaching to the edge of ramp ascent, click the “Ramp Ascent” button on the GUI before the toe-off of the prosthetic leg stepping on the ramp and switch the intrinsic control to ramp ascent mode. For safety, allow the subject to use a hand railing when walking on a ramp.\nWhen the subject comes to the end of the ramp, click the “Walking” button again before the heel strike of prosthetic leg stepping onto the level platform and switch the prosthesis intrinsic control to level-ground walking mode.\nAt the end of the walking path, instruct the subject to stop and remain in standing position. At the same time, click the “Standing” button before the double stance phase and switch the intrinsic control back to standing mode.\nAfter around 5 seconds, terminate data collection by clicking “Stop” button. Label collected data as “training data set 1”.\nRepeat the procedure 3.4.4-3.4.9 when the subject walks in a reverse route back to the starting location; the only difference is switching the intrinsic control to ramp descent mode when the subject walks on the down ramp.\nRepeat 3.4.4-3.4.10 until ten complete training data sets are collected. Examine the signal quality of collected training data set.\nAllow the subject to have a rest period after the data collection session.\nTrain the pattern recognition classifiers in NMI via offline training module (Figure 1). Use the collected EMG and mechanical signals, the activity modes (classes) labeled during the training procedure, and detected phases to build the phase-dependent pattern classifiers. Save parameters of the classifiers automatically for later online testing session.\nOnline Testing of Neural Control of Powered Transfemoral Prosthesis\n\t\nInstruct the subject to stand at the starting point of the walking path.",
    "Turn on the powered prosthesis. Load the trained classifier to online testing module and the parameters to the intrinsic controller.\nInstruct the subject to begin the testing trials in a standing position, then continuously transition to level-ground walking, ramp walking, level-ground walking, and finally stop and finish this trial at the end of the walking path. Instruct the subject to perform each activity at a comfortable pace. Allow rest periods between trials to avoid fatigue.\nDuring each testing trial, display the activity modes of the prosthesis and knee joint angle readings on a TV monitor. Save all of the measurements and control outputs for later evaluation purpose.\nRepeat steps 3.5.1-3.5.4 until ten complete testing trials are finished. \nSubscription Required.
