    "1. Equipment Preparation \nExamine the ultrasound transducer for defects. Depending on the equipment used, this step may be unnecessary.\n\t\nIf an air bubble is observed, remove the screw located on the right side of the transducer head, and add sterile water through the hole with a 26 G needle. Air bubbles inside the transducer head are common. They will impede the acquisition of quality images.\nCheck the membrane covering the probe for leaks or holes. Replace if necessary.\nOpen the software and initialize the probe.\n\t\nChoose the cardiac package from the drop down menu, along with the appropriate transducer. Click \"initialize\". Use a 20-60 MHz probe for mice under 35 g and a 15-45 MHz probe for mice greater than 35 g.\nSelect the operator, animal & date on the demographics screen, and select \"start\".\n2. Mouse Preparation Including Anesthesia, Hair Removal, and Positioning \nAnesthesia: place the mouse in an induction chamber and anesthetize with a portable, table top anesthesia machine containing an isoflurane vaporizer and a waste gas container.",
    "Set the vaporizer to 3% with an oxygen flow rate of 3 L/min. This relatively high anesthesia rate is used to achieve rapid anesthetic effect and therefore minimize stress response that may influence cardiac function.  The short duration of the protocol minimizes any potential risk to the animal.  It is very important to always keep the anesthesia rate the same. This protocol has been optimized for exclusive use of isoflurane as the anesthetic, therefore optimal conditions for other agents may vary from this protocol. A lower depth of anesthesia may be chosen, depending on experimental needs, but once an anesthetic protocol is established, it must not be changed. Anesthesia affects heart rate and other hemodynamic measurements. Therefore, if the depth of anesthesia is changed during an experiment, the data may not be useful for analyses. If several mice are to be imaged in one day, anesthetize them separately.\nMonitor room temperature to ensure it is the same between experimental groups. Room temperature can affect vasoreactivity, even when the mouse is on a heated table, so it should be monitored and kept the same between experimental groups that will be compared. Although this protocol does not measure animal temperature directly, constant ambient and table temperature ensures that there is little variation in temperature between experimental groups.\nHair removal: Remove hair from the chest with a depilatory cream after the mouse is anesthetized. Begin application with a cotton-tipped applicator, at the clavicles, and continue to just below the diaphragm.",
    "Place the mouse back in the anesthesia chamber for 1 min to allow the depilatory to work. To determine if anesthesia is effective, firmly press your thumbnail against one of the mouse's paws. If there is no withdraw, anesthesia is adequate. If the limb withdraws, place the mouse back in the anesthesia chamber for another minute.\nApply a small amount of lubricating ointment to the mouse's eyes to avoid damage to the cornea.\nRemove hair from the chest with a 2 in x 2 in gauze pad. The chemical used in the depilatory cream is caustic, and will harm skin if it is left on for too long, so care should be taken to remove all product from the skin.\nApply a skin moisturizer following hair removal.\nPositioning: Place the mouse in a ventrodorsal position on a heated table set to 37 °C. Correct positioning is imperative to the acquisition of quality images. Use a table that can capture body temperature, respiration, and heart rate. Use of an integrated rail system allows for precise positioning and subsequently, image optimization.\n\t\nGently tape down all four paws and apply a dime size amount of transduction gel to the chest.\n3. Acquisition of Images: Imaging in Parasternal Long Axis View \nLock the ultrasound transducer into place inside the mount on the rail system, and rotate it 10° counterclockwise, so that the metal probe of the transducer is positioned directly over the heart. More specifically, the probe should be on the left side of the chest, in the 2nd or 3rd intercostal space, and lateral to the sternum.\n\t\nManipulate the x- and y-axes located on the rail system, until the correct view is obtained.",
    "Select \"B Mode\". This is found in the upper right portion of the system console, in order to project a 2D live image.\nView the following anatomic structures on the monitor:\n\t\t\nThe entire heart from apex to aorta - The apex will be visualized on the far left of the screen, and the aorta on the far right.\nThe lumen of the left ventricle (LV)\nPosterior wall of the left ventricle (LPW)\nInterventricular septum (IVS)\nThe lumen of the right ventricle (RV)\nAnterior and posterior mitral valve leaflets (AML & PML)\nAscending aorta (AO)\nLeft atrium (LA)\nObtain one diametric measurement of the aorta in this view by pressing the scan/freeze button to \"freeze\" the image. Then use the mouse to pull back through the video loop at the bottom of the image until the left ventricle is in systole, and the aorta is at its greatest diameter.\n\t\nClick the measurement tool in the upper left corner of the screen and select the icon that looks like a diagonal line. Left click your mouse and draw a straight line from the anterior to the posterior wall of the aorta, perpendicular to its long axis. Save by pressing the \"Frame Store\" button.\nCreate a video loop by pressing \"Cine Store\"\n4. Acquisition of Images: Imaging in Parasternal Short Axis View\nReposition the transducer to the 3 and 9 o'clock positions (transverse). Angle slightly caudally by manipulating the transducer mount to achieve the best view of the aorta and LV lumen. The metal probe will be positioned horizontally and directly over the sternum.",
    "Manipulate the x- and y-axes on the rail system until the correct view is obtained. The LV lumen will be seen, along with the anterolateral and posteromedial papillary muscles, which are visible on the right of the monitor. This is the standard reference point for the short axis, indicating the mid portion of the left ventricle, where dimension measurements are made. Deviating slightly from the reference point with the x- and y-axes to bring different anatomical structures in view will be necessary, but positioning is explained by referencing the above view.\nObtain the following measurements in the short axis view:\n\t\nB mode \nTwo more diametric measurements of the aorta.\nThree measurements of the pulmonary outflow tract.\nPulsed wave Doppler mode (PW)\nThree velocity time integral measurements (VTI) of the aorta\nThree VTI measurements of the pulmonary artery measured just proximal to the pulmonary valve.\nMeasure pulmonary artery acceleration time by tracing the VTI curve from the beginning of blood flow to peak velocity.\nM mode\nThree measurements of the left ventricular internal diameter in diastole (LVIDd)\nThree measurements of the left ventricular internal diameter in systole (LVIDs)\nThree measurements of the right ventricular internal diameter (RVID). The RV lumen will only be visible in this view if it is dilated.\nMeasure heart rate three times using m-mode by tracing the distance between two diastolic peaks of the anterior wall of the LV during three different cardiac cycles.\nB mode measurements:\nManipulate the Y axis cranially from the papillary muscle view, until the semilunar valve of the aorta comes into focus.\nObtain measurements of the aorta just above the valve at the greatest diameter.\nClick the measurement tool in the upper left corner of the screen, and select the icon that looks like a diagonal line.",
    "Left click your mouse and draw a straight line from the anterior to the posterior wall of the aorta.\nManipulate the x- and y-axes until the main pulmonary artery bifurcates. This structure will be seen anteriorly, and to the right of the aorta on the monitor.\nManipulate the y-axis cranially until the annulus of the main pulmonary artery comes into view. It will not be as clearly defined as the aorta.\n\"Freeze\" the image and obtain the measurement in systole.\nCollect three measurements in total.\nPulsed wave (PW) Doppler measurements: PW Mode is primarily used for hemodynamic assessment of blood flow through arteries and veins. In this protocol, it will be used to retrieve three velocity time integral measurements of the aorta and pulmonary artery.\n\t\nBring the aorta back into view as described in step 4.3.1, and bullet point 1.\n\t\t\nSelect \"PW Mode\". This is located on the upper right corner of the system console and will produce a Doppler reading of blood flow through the aorta.\nPlace the sample volume just above the level of the aortic valve. The x- and y-axes may need to be adjusted slightly to obtain sufficient Doppler envelopes. The envelopes should have white borders, and a hollow inside indicating laminar blood flow.\nOnce a sufficient view is obtained, \"freeze\" the image and trace the border of the Doppler envelope. This will calculate the VTI.",
    "Rotate the \"Angle\" knob located on the system console clockwise until the segmented yellow line seen in the image on the upper right-hand side of the monitor is at 0°. This yellow line represents the direction of blood flow through the vessel. Since the transducer itself is angled in such a way to produce a cross-sectional or transverse view of the heart, the line must be adjusted to 0°, to align with the vertical flow of blood through the ascending aorta.\nPlace the sample volume proximal to the level of the pulmonary valve in the center of the right ventricular outflow tract and repeat VTI measurements as above. The flow of blood should appear inverted, or opposite the flow of blood in relation to the aorta on the monitor.\nM mode measurements: M-mode imaging provides high temporal resolution of tissue motion along a single ultrasound beam, and is used to quantify cavity dimensions, as well to study valvular, myocardial, and vessel wall movement.\n\t\nResume \"B Mode\" and reposition the transducer to obtain the \"reference view\" (the cross sectional view of the left ventricle at the level of the papillary muscles).\nPress \"M-mode\". This will produce a continuous video feed in which the motion of the following anatomical structures will be visible as a \"ribbon\". If dilated, the RV lumen will appear at the top of the feed as a very thin black ribbon. The interventricular septum (IVS) will be visible as an opaque ribbon directly below the RV lumen. The LV lumen will be seen directly below the IVS. It is the large black space that occupies the majority of the feed. Below the LV lumen is the LV posterior wall (LVPW) which will be seen as an opaque ribbon.",
    "Freeze the image and pull back through the video loop if needed to a point where respiration is not occurring. When the mouse respires, the image acquisition is disrupted by movement of the diaphragm and chest wall, thereby producing a distorted \"smeared\" artifact in the feed that occurs with regular frequency.\nObtain the following measurements using the diagonal line icon:\n\t\t\nThree measurements of LV end diastolic dimension, which appears as the largest distance between the IVS and LVPW.\nThree measurements of LV end systolic dimension, which appears as the shortest distance between the IVS and LVPW.\nThree measurements of heart rate, which is done by clicking the heart icon and measuring from systolic peak to systolic peak of the LVPW.\nIf the RV lumen is dilated, obtain three measurements using the diagonal line icon.\nRecord a video loop of the short parasternal axis view in \"B mode\" by pressing the \"Cine Store\" button.\nGo to \"File\", select \"Browse Study\" to recap your measurements, click \"End Session\", and then \"Commit Session Data.\"\nRecover the mouse as outlined by the IACUC protocol, and clean up.\nExport data as a CSV file to a thumb drive for subsequent analysis.\nCalculate the following parameters of cardiac function (Table 1):\n\t\nLeft ventricular outflow tract area\nLeft ventricle stroke volume\nLeft ventricle cardiac output\nFractional shortening\nPulmonary artery area\nPulmonary artery acceleration time\nRight ventricle stroke volume\nCardiac index\nSubscription Required.
