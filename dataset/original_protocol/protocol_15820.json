    "NOTE: All subjects must give their written consent prior to the examination, and the protocol must be approved by the appropriate local ethical review board(s). All methods described here were approved by the Regional Scientific Ethical Committee and the Danish Data Protection Agency.\nThe TMS method involves three stages: 1) preparation of the subject, 2) recording the TMS, and 3) analyzing the results.\n1. Preparation of the subject\nAssess the subjects' medical history and ask whether the subject has epilepsy, a pacemaker, or any kind of metallic devices/implants in the body, and for the female subjects, whether she is pregnant.\nInstruct the subject in detail about the examinations and invite them to give written consent.\n\t\nInform the subject about the application of magnetic stimulation to the scalp and that each examination takes approximately 10 min.\nExplain that the stimulation will be heard as a click sound and is meant to evoke a muscle twitch and that some stimuli may feel slightly unpleasant.\nExplain that the stimulation can be turned off at any time if signaled by the subject.\nAsk the subject to wear a swimming cap.\nClean the subject's hand contralateral to the studied hemisphere.\nPlace the active recording electrode over the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle and the reference electrode on the 2nd metacarpophalangeal joint.\nPlace a ground electrode on the dorsum of the hand.\nConnect the recording and ground electrodes to the amplifier.\nInstruct the subject to remain alert but relaxed during the examination.\n2. TMS recording\nNOTE: The description below applies to the specific software and instruments used (see the Table of Materials); these will need to be adapted for other hardware.\nTurn on the TMS device.\nStart the semi-automated recording software using the protocol for TMS recordings.",
    "Select the gain and gating options from the menu (Table 1). Click on OK to continue.\nSelect the protocol CSP from the main options.\nPlace the coil at approximately 4 cm left in the binauricular line from the vertex, with the handle pointing 45° to the parasagittal plane for posterior-anterior current induction.\nIncrease the stimulus intensity manually by clicking on the Insert key until an MEP is obtained.\nMove the position of the coil slightly while monitoring MEPs to find the hotspot.\nDraw the outline of the coil on a swimming cap once the hotspot is located to enable constant coil positioning.\nClick on OK to initiate the automated stimulation protocol.\n\tNOTE: The recording continues automatically, starting with the determination of the RMT at 200 µV.\nInstruct the subject to maintain comfortable activation of the FDI muscle to measure the active motor threshold (AMT) for a 200 µV response.\nClick on OK to measure the silent periods with or without a pause between the 3 groups of 10 up and down cycles of stimuli.\n\tNOTE: For each group of 10, the stimulus is increased from 0.8 to 1.6 × RMT200, at intervals of 0.2, and then repeated in the reverse order.\nTell the subject to relax after the last stimulus and click on OK to return to the main menu.\nSelect the protocol SICI from the main options.\nSelect the planned ISIs to be studied from the menu SICI ISI options and the number of stimuli at each ISI from the menu Number of stimuli per ISI if the defaults are not used.\nSelect the ASICI from the menu.",
    "NOTE: The recording continues automatically, starting with the determination of the RMT at 200 µV and then at 1000 µV. SICI recording starts automatically after the determination of the RMT and continues for approximately 10 min. Test stimulus is fixed at RMT1000 and conditioning stimuli at 70% of RMT200. The following ISIs are selected in a pseudorandom order: 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, and 7 ms. Test-alone stimuli are given after each three paired stimuli. Thus, each paired stimulus is delivered 10 times, making a total of 120 stimuli.\nEnsure that the coil position is stable by observing the outline on the swimming cap, MEP on the screen, and contractions in the muscle during the recording.\nWhen the screen returns automatically to the main menu options when the protocol is completed, select the TSICIp from the menu.\n\tNOTE: The recording continues automatically, starting with the determination of the RMT at 200 µV and then SICI recording for approximately 10 min. RMT200 is tracked continuously by decreasing stimulus by 1% maximal stimulator output (MSO) if the response is more than 250 µV and increasing it by 1% if the response is less than 160 µV. The test-alone stimuli alternate with paired stimuli, and the paired stimuli are delivered with pseudorandomized ISIs: 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, and 7 ms. Thus, a total of 120 stimuli are delivered, 10 times for each of the 9 paired stimuli and test-alone stimuli after each three paired stimuli.\nAfter the screen returns automatically to the main menu options when the protocol is completed, click on Finish unless another protocol will be run.\nFinish the recording by clicking on the Close file and save data button.\n3. TMS analyses\nStart the analyzing software program to do the analyses offline.",
    "Select the recording which will be analyzed and click on the OK button.\nSelect Create TMS MEM file option from the TMS menu for the analysis.\nClick on OK to save the MEM file.\nClick on Plot TMS MEM/MEF option from the TMS menu for the comparison of the individual subject´s recording with a group of healthy controls.\nClick on the 1st option on the MEF file name menu. Then, click on the MEF file with which the comparison will be made from the list of MEF files.\nClick on the 1st option on the MEM file name menu. Then, click on the MEM file with which the comparison will be made from the list of MEM files.\nSuperimpose the MEM and MEF files using different options of 95% confidence intervals, standard deviations, or standard errors."
