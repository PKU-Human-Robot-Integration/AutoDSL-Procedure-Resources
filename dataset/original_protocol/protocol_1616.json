    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nElectroporation of iPSCs by MaxCyte ATx electroporator (option 1)\nTiming: 1–2 h\nNote: If you use 4D-nucleofector as transfection method, skip steps 1–4 and go to step 5.\nMaxCyte electroporation of iPSCs enables higher efficiency and viability compared with other electroporation platforms under the conditions we have tested in the laboratory. We believe higher cell viability may enable better HDR efficiency when performing genome editing with CRISPR-Cas9 RNP and an ssODN template.\nDay-1 or Day-2: Passage iPSCs one or two days before electroporation at a high cell density\nFor pre-coating of a 6-well plate with 0.25 μg/cm2 of iMatrix-511 (half of the usual concentration), prepare 2.5 μg of iMatrix-511 diluted in 2 mL of PBS. Then, coat wells at 37°C for at least 2 h in a humidified CO2 incubator. If more than one well is being coated, a master mix of the PBS and iMatrix-511 can be made in a 50 mL conical centrifuge tube and then added to each well.\nWash iPSCs with 2 mL of PBS once and remove PBS.\nAdd 0.5 mL of Accutase to the well.\nAlternatives: 0.5 × TrypLE solution can be used instead of Accutase. Accutase may be less toxic for iPSCs than 0.5 × TrypLE solution, especially at the timing of electroporation.\nRock the plate every 3–4 min to ensure the Accutase covers the cells homogenously in the well.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C for 10 min. The cells should become rounded in the plate.",
    "Pipette the cells up and down in the Accutase solution with a 1000 μL pipette tip to detach the cells from the plate. Suspend the cells by pipetting while in the Accutase mixture to make sure the cells are dissociated well. Be careful not to pipette the cells too quickly to avoid shear stress, which will lower cell viability.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing 0.9 mL of StemFit media.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 120 × g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend cells with 1 mL of StemFit media containing 10 μM Y-27632 by gentle pipetting.\nCount cells and check cell viability by trypan blue staining. The ideal cell viability is greater than 90%. If the cell viability is lower than 80%, it may indicate that the overall cell health is not optimal and more sensitive to electroporation damage.\nPlate 1.5 × 106 cells of live iPSCs in the pre-coated iMatrix-511 plate in 2 mL of StemFit media containing 10 μM Y-27632. Incubate in a CO2 incubator at 37°C for one day.\nCritical: The initial cell condition is critical. In our experience, passaging the iPSCs one or two days before electroporation has resulted in high HDR efficiencies. There may be some iPSC lines that are more fragile and may not respond well to passaging one day before electroporation. If this is the case, then the cells could be passaged two or three days before the above cell dissociation at a high cell density (i.e., 1.5–2.0 × 106 cells/well in case 6 well plate).\nDay 0: Preparation of the MaxCyte ATx electroporation instrument.\nTurn on the laptop PC connected to the MaxCyte ATx electroporation instrument at least 10 min before electroporation.\nAfter logging into the laptop PC, turn on the ATx instrument.",
    "Click the ATx shortcut icon on the Windows desktop.\nSelect desired protocol for the experiment. Optimization 8 was the electroporation protocol established in our laboratory with several cell lines for efficient delivery of a variety of loading agents including DNA plasmids, mRNA, and CRISPR-Cas9 RNP.\nSelect the OC-100 processing assembly from the processing assembly dropdown menu.\nDay 0: Preparation of iPSCs for electroporation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\n6-well plate with 0.25 μg/cm2 of iMatrix-511 (half of usual concentration) at 37°C for at least 1 h in a humidified CO2 incubator.\nAspirate the coating buffer and add 2 mL of StemFit media containing 10 μM Y-27632 into each well, and incubate in a CO2 incubator at 37°C for pre-warming the media until finish the dissociation of iPSCs\nPerform the same procedures 1.b–i.\nAdd 1 mL of MaxCyte HyClone Buffer to the cell pellet and pipet up and down gently to dissociate and wash the pellet.\nCount the cells and check for cell viability by trypan blue staining. The cell viability is suggested to be >80 %. Lower cell viability may indicate cells are not in optimal condition.\nCentrifuge at 120 × g for 5 min (at room temperature).\nAspirate MaxCyte HyClone Buffer.\nResuspend iPSC pellet in MaxCyte HyClone buffer at a cell density of 1 × 107 cells/mL. Take into account the volume of the cell pellet itself when adding the MaxCyte HyClone buffer. For example, if there is the cell pellet with 1 × 106 cells with around 10 μL of volume, add 90 μL of MaxCyte HyClone buffer to be the total 100 μL. For one electroporation condition, 50 μL of cell suspension is needed.",
    "Alternatives: Higher cell densities up to 1 × 108 cells/mL can also be used without a loss in efficiency. Higher cell densities during electroporation can be considered in order to obtain a larger number of edited cells.\nPrepare CRISPR-Cas9 RNP mixture by mixing 10 μg of CRISPR-Cas9 protein with 2.5 μg of IVT gRNA and incubate at room temperature for at least 10 min in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nNote: The gRNA amount can be increased to 2–3 fold (5–7.5 μg). A higher ratio of gRNA to Cas9 protein ensures that free Cas9 is in a complex with gRNA, for improving knockout and knock-in efficiency.\nThen add 10 μg of ssODN into the Cas9/gRNA complex.\nCritical: If this concentration of ssODN is causing low cell viability after electroporation, the amount of the ssODN can be titrated down in order to achieve better viability. The amount of ssODN can be optimized between 5 and 12 μg. Note, we found that high ssODN concentration tends to give a higher HDR rate, but is more toxic for cells.\nAdd 50 μL of the iPSC cell suspension to the microcentrifuge tube containing the Cas9/gRNA complex and ssODN solution. Pipette up and down five times gently and avoid introducing air bubbles.\nTransfer the cell mixture to the OC-100 processing assembly slowly but steadily, only going to the first stop of the pipette in order to avoid the introduction of air bubbles. The OC-100 could be tapped gently to ensure the solution spreads out in the processing assembly. The mixture of single cells and CRISPR-Cas9/gRNA complex is not required to be incubated on ice before the electroporation step.",
    "Critical: An air bubble in the cuvette may lead to an abnormal electric current. Make sure to avoid the addition of air bubbles. If found, make sure to remove it by using a 10 μL pipette. Also, make sure your cell suspension solution is evenly distributed (importantly, touching both electrodes on the side walls) in the well of the cuvette, so that an electric field will be evenly applied.\nCritical: Do not leave the iPSCs sitting in the MaxCyte buffer for an extended period of time before electroporation. This may result in sensitizing the cells to more damage during electroporation.\nOptional: If the purpose of the experiment is gene knockout, omit the step ”j” and proceed to the next step.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1179-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. MaxCyte ATx mediated electroporation of RNP complex into iPSCs\n(A) Prepare a mixture of MaxCyte HyClone buffer with cells and RNP complex, and ssODN if applicable. Transfer 50 μL of the mixture into the well of OC-100 Processing Assembly chamber, after opening the lid. Then close the lid after the sample has been added to the OC-100.\n(B) Operation of the instrument. Select the desired electroporation protocol (Optimization Energy 8), and processing assembly (OC-100). Finally insert the OC-100 processing assembly and start electroporation.\nDay 0: Electroporation of iPSCs\nInsert the OC-100 into the MaxCyte ATx electroporation port.\nPress “Start” on the instrument software.\nThe first electroporation takes about 40 s for the machine to charge up. The actual electroporation is around 2–3 s.\nWhen you have more than 2 samples for electroporation, the electroporation from the 2nd sample will take only 2–3 s as you do not have to wait for the charge\nAfter electroporation is completed, place the OC-100 into a 37°C humidified CO2 incubator for 20–30 min to allow for cell membrane recovery.",
    "After the recovery step, the cells can be transferred from the OC-100 to a well of 6-well plate with 2 mL of StemFit media containing 10 μM Y-27632 which is pre-coated with iMatrix-511 as described above.\n(Optional step) Rinse the OC-100 processing assembly with 50 μL of StemFit media in order to recover residual cells and add them to the culture vessel.\nNote: Cell viability can be affected by the seeding density. If you find significant cell death, try to use a smaller plate, such as 12-well plate for seeding.\nIncubate the cells in 37°C for culturing. Y-27632 can be removed after 1–2 days of transfection.\nOptional: if there are a lot of dead cells even after 2 days of transfection, keep adding Y-27632 in culturing media until cell recovery.\nAfter 3–5 days of transfection when cells become semi-confluent, dissociate cells. Expand a part of cells when it is necessary to maintain the cells, make a cell stock or extract genomic DNA.\nOptional: If there are enough cells, we recommend making a freeze stock of cells by STEM-CELLBANKER.\nPause point: Once genomic DNA was extracted and frozen cell stocks were made, you may pause at this point.\nElectroporation of iPSCs by 4D-Nucleofector (option 2)\nTiming: 1–2 h\nNote: If you use MaxCyte as transfection method, skip step 5–7 and go to step 8.\n4D-nucleofector electroporation also enables high knockout and knock-in efficiency as the MaxCyte electroporator described above.\nDay-1 - 0: Plate coating.\nPrepare a 6-well plate where each well contains 2 mL of StemFit media containing 10 μM Y-27632 as described in MaxCyte part 3. a, b.\nDay 0: Set up the 4D-nucleofector program for transfection (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3])\nNote: This section can be done in parallel to “3. Preparation of iPSCs for electroporation[href=https://www.wicell.org#olist0090]”\nTurn on the 4D-nucleofector instrument.",
    "Chose X unit.\nChose X-16 Strip (or X-single if you are using Single Nucleocuvette)\nSelect the wells you are going to transfect.\nSet program as CA-137 and P4 primary buffer (or the buffer you are using).\nOptional: If necessary, other programs (CM-138, CM137, CM-150, DS-137, DS-138, and DS-130) also work for electroporating human iPSCs.\nPress “OK” for opening the tray port and proceed the cell preparation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1179-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. 4D-Nucleofector mediated electroporation of RNP complex into iPSCs\n(A) Prepare mixture of P4 primary buffer with cells and RNP complex, and ssODN if applicable. Transfer 20 μL of the mixture into one well of 16 well strips.\n(B) Operation of the instrument. Select wells where your samples are, and then input pulse code (CA-137) and select solution (Primary Cell P4). Finally insert your 16 well strips and start electroporation.\nDay 0: Preparation of iPSCs for electroporation\nPerform the cell dissociation procedures as described in “Passage of iPSCs[href=https://www.wicell.org#olist0020]” section 2. b–d.\nAlternatives: For cell dissociation by Accutase, see the MaxCyte electroporation section.\nPerform cell counting using a hemocytometer and trypan blue.\nFor one electroporation condition, add 3.0 × 105 cells per condition in a 1.5 mL tube. If there are 5 conditions, multiple by 5 (i.e., 1.5 × 106 cells).\nCentrifuge at 120 × g for 5 min (at room temperature).\nAspirate supernatant.\nAdd 20 μL of P4 Primary Cell Solution per condition into the cell pellet and gently suspend at room temperature. If you have 5 conditions, add 100 μL of P4 Primary Cell Solution.\nNote: P3 Primary Cell Solution can also be used, instead of P4 Primary Cell Solution.\nPrepare CRISPR-Cas9 RNP mixture by mixing 5 μg of CRISPR-Cas9 protein with 1.25 μg of IVT gRNA and incubate at room temperature in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.",
    "Note: 1.25 μg gRNA should be sufficient to 5 μg Cas9 in terms of molar ratio (roughly 1:1 molar ratio), however increasing gRNA to 2.5–3.75 μg may improve genome editing efficiency sometimes.\nAdd 10 (or 6–12) μg of ssODN as a template for single nucleotide alteration or loxP insertion.\nCritical: If this concentration of ssODN causes low cell viability after electroporation, the amount of the ssODN can be titrated down in order to achieve better viability. However, if the ssODN amount is too low, it may reduce knock-in efficiency.\nTransfer 20 μL of Cas9/gRNA and ssODN mixture into a well of Nucleocuvette Strip at room temperature. DO NOT make bubbles.\nCritical: An air bubble in the cuvette causes an electric spark when high voltage is applied. Make sure to avoid air bubbles as possible. If you find one, make sure to remove it by using a P-10 pipette. Also, make sure your cell suspension solution is evenly distributed (especially, both sides of the electrode wall) in the well of the cuvette, so that electric field will be evenly applied.\nSet Nucleocuvette strip into 4D-Nucleofector.\nPress “Start” for starting electroporation.\nAfter electroporation, add 50–80 μL of StemFit media with Y-27632 into each well of Nucleocuvette Strip, pipet up and down several times gently, and transfer all cells into one well of the 6-well plate with 2 mL of StemFit media containing 10 μM Y-27632 which pre-coated with iMatrix-511 as described in the “Plate coating[href=https://www.wicell.org#o0010]” section.\nNote: Cell viability can be affected by the seeding density. If you find significant cell death, try to use smaller plate, such as 12-well or 24-well plate for seeding.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C for culturing. Y-27632 can be removed after 1–2 days of transfection.",
    "Optional: if you see a lot of dead cells even after 2 days of transfection, you can keep adding Y-27632 in culturing media until cell recovery.\nAfter 4–7 days of transfection when cells become semi-confluent, dissociate cells. Expand a part of cells when it is necessary to maintain the cells, make a cell stock or extract genomic DNA.\nOptional: If there is a sufficient cell number, we recommend to make a freeze stock of cells by STEM-CELLBANKER.\nOptional: If the purpose of the experiment is gene knockout, omit the step “h” and proceed to the next step.\nPause point: Once genomic DNA was extracted and frozen cell stocks were made, you may pause at this point.\nAssessment of genome editing efficiency in bulk iPSCs by Sanger sequencing\nTiming: 1–2 day(s)\nAssess overall genome editing efficiency in the electroporated iPSCs. This is an important step to validate your genome editing procedure worked or not, and to estimate how many subclones will be necessary to genotype from the bulk cells.\nGenomic extraction\nExtract genomic DNA from the cell pellet by using MonoFas gDNA Cultured Cells Extraction Kit VI. This will be used for analyzing knockout efficiency in the next section. As a negative control, make sure to prepare genomic DNA from non-transfected iPSCs as well.\nPCR and sequencing\nDesign a pair of PCR primers to amplify the target locus by using Primer-blast or Primer3 software. Preferred PCR band size is around 500–800 bp for Sanger sequencing, and 150–200 bp for gel electrophoresis analysis for loxP insertion. The gRNA target locus should be located in the middle part of the amplified region.\nAmplify the target locus from the genomic sample(s) by PCR. Make sure to amplify from the non-genome edited sample as a negative control. PCR Reaction:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1179_6.csv\nPCR cycling conditions\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1179_7.csv",
    "Note: Try a higher amount (0.5–2 μg) of template genomic DNA if PCR amplification didn’t happen.\nRun on a 2% agarose gel to confirm a specific amplification. If a loxP sequence is inserted, you may see an additional band with 34-bp larger size. If you see non-specific amplification, optimize the PCR condition (i.e., raise annealing temperature). If desired, you may perform gel extraction to exclude the non-specific bands.\nSend the PCR sample for Sanger sequencing service. (i.e., GENEWIZ)\nDecomposition of Sanger sequence result by using ICE (Inference of CRISPR Edits) CRISPR Analysis tool.\nAfter you received Sangar sequencing result as “ab1” file, access to ICE web site and upload a control sample file and genome edited sample file. Alternatively, TIDE website can also be utilized.\nAn example of ICE analysis for detecting NHEJ events is shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1179-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Sequencing results of the control sample (non-transfection) and experiment sample (transfected) were shown in upper panel. In the experiment sample, a mixture of spectrum can be observed after the Cas9 cleavage site.\n(B) Analysis result by ICE software. Indel percentage of the above Sanger sequencing data analyzed by ICE was 92 %, and knockout-score (exclude in-frame indels) was 83 %.",
    "Select the best condition (i.e., choice of gRNA or amount of ssODN) which shows the highest knock-in efficiency. The overall rate of expected genome editing outcomes is critical. If the efficiency is greater than 20–30%, proceed to the next subcloning step. If the efficiency is less than 10%, we recommend optimizing the experimental design or electroporation condition. Otherwise, it is necessary to screen hundreds of subclones for identifying a genome-edited clone.\"\nExpand the iPSCs that were confirmed for successful genome editing as described in the previous section. Make some frozen stocks as necessary.\nIsolation of subclones of iPSCs and genotyping\nTiming: 3–4 weeks\nDay-7 - 0: Preparation of subcloning\nHarvest the semi-confluent iPSCs from the above section by 0.5 × TrypLE Select.\nCoat three 96-well plates with iMatrix-511 at least 1–24 h before cell seeding.\nIf a cell sorter is available, proceed to single-cell sorting as described in step 12. If not, proceed to limit dilution as described in step 13.\nDay 0: Sub-cloning by single cell sorting\nPerform the cell dissociation procedures as described in “Preparation of human iPSCs” section 2. b–d.\nPerform cell counting using a hemocytometer and trypan blue.\nAdd 1.0–10.0 × 105 of live cells in a 1.5 mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 120 × g for 5 min (at room temperature).\nRemove supernatant.\nGently resuspend cells in 300 μL of FACS buffer (2% FBS in PBS). Transfer into a 5 mL flow tube with cell strainer to remove cell clumps.\nUse a cell sorter (i.e., BD FACS Aria II) to sort 1 cell/well of 96-well plate which prepared at part d. of “Day-7–0: Preparation of sub cloning”.\nIncubate the sorted 96-well plate at 37°C in a CO2 incubator.\nDay 0: Sub-cloning by limit dilution (Optional)",

If the genome editing efficiency at the bulk stage was less than 10%–20%, preparation of more 96-well plates is recommended.\nRemove iMatrix coating buffer from the plate prepared in “Day-7–0: Preparation of sub cloning”.\nAdd 100 μL of the cell suspension into one well of 96-well plate by using a multi-channel pipette. Make sure to suspend the cells frequently, to avoid uneven cell seeding.\nIncubate the plates at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nThe next day, observe each well of the 96-well plates under a microscope and mark the wells with single-cell seeding. A well with more than one cell should be discarded.\nDay 2–14: After cell sorting or limit dilution (common step)",
    "After the single-cell seeding into a 96-well plate, there is a risk of cell loss during medium change. Instead of complete removal of media, add 50 μL of fresh StemFit media with 10 μM Y-27632 into a well of 96-well plate every 2 or 3 days.\nOn day 6 or day 7, change media with StemFit (without Y-27632).\nColonies will be visible at around day 7–10. Mark the wells with a single colony of iPS. If more than two colonies were observed, discard such wells.\nAdd media for the wells with a single iPSC colony every 2 days (add 50 μL for 96-well plate)\nAround day 9-11, once the iPSC colony will become 100–300 μm in diameter, passage all the cells from one well of 96-well plate into a well of 24-well plate.\nChange media every 2 days until iPSCs become semi-confluent.\nDay 14–21: After passaging cells from a single-cell derived colony\nWhen passaged cells become semi-confluent, extract genomic DNA from half of the cells by using MonoFas gDNA Cultured Cells Extraction Kit VI or a similar genome DNA extraction kit (i.e., Direct PCR). As the starting cell number is low, elute genomic DNA in a smaller volume (i.e., 40 μL) of elution buffer. Make a vial of freeze stock from the other half the cells using STEM-CELLBANKER.\nRepeat step a. for all single clones.\nWhen the number of samples has accumulated to some extent, perform PCR amplification of the target region and Sanger sequencing as described in the “assessment of genome editing efficiency in bulk iPSCs by Sanger sequencing[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3]” section. Repeat this step for all the isolated subclones or until desired subclones are identified.",
