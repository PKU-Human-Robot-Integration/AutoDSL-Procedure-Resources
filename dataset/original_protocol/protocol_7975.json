Preparation and injection of roGFP2-Orp1 mRNA\nNOTE: roGFP2-Orp1 construct was obtained from Dr. Tobias Dick, DKFZ, Germany. It was sub-cloned into the pCS2+ vector in Dr. Qing Deng's Lab, Purdue University. To prevent degradation by RNase, several precautions must be taken. RNase-free reagents and tubes must be used at all times, gloves must be worn for all steps, and, alternatively, materials and surfaces can be wiped with a cleaning agent for RNase removal.\nLinearize the 3-10 µg of pCS2+/roGFP2-Orp1 vector with NotI.\nPurify the linearized plasmid with a PCR clean-up kit.\nIn vitro transcribe the roGFP2-Orp1 mRNA with an in vitro transcription kit according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer.\n\t\nCapped transcription reaction assembly\n\t\t\nPlace RNA polymerase and linearized/purified DNA on ice. Vortex 10x reaction buffer and 2x NTP/CAP until they are completely in solution. Store NTP/CAP on ice but keep the buffer at room temperature (RT) while assembling the reaction. Touch-spin all reagents before opening tubes to prevent contamination.\nSet up RNA synthesis reaction in the order indicated below at RT in an RNase-free 0.5 mL centrifuge tube. Final volume of the reaction is 20 µL. Reaction setup is shown in Table 6.",
    "Add 10 µL of ribonucleotide mix, 2x NTP/CAP, and nuclease free water, if needed to the tube. Add 2 µL 10X reaction buffer. Add 1-1.5 µg of linear DNA (up to 6 µL). If needed, add nuclease-free water to make up 20 µL reaction volume.\nClose the tube, vortex briefly and touch-spin microfuge. Add 2 µL of 10x SP6 enzyme mix. Close with a finger click and touch-spin in a microfuge.\nPlace in 37 °C for 2-2.5 h (can go up to 18 h).\n\t\t\t​NOTE: In the presented experiment overnight 16-18 h incubation at 37 °C was performed for best results.\nAdd 1 µL of DNase to remove DNA template, finger click, touch spin, and incubate at 37 °C for 15 min.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2\nReagent,Volume (µL),Amount in reaction\n2X NTP/CAP,10,1X\n10X Reaction Buffer,2,1X\nTemplate DNA,Up to 6,1-1.5 µg\nNuclease-free water,Add to make 20 µL,\n10X SP6 enzyme mix,2,1X\nTable 6: Reaction setup for roGFP2-Orp1 mRNA in vitro transcription.\nRNA recovery\n\t\nAdd 25 µL of lithium chloride (LiCl) supplied in the in vitro transcription kit. Place at -20 °C in a non-frost freezer for at least 30 min.\nSpin for 25 min at maximum speed in a tabletop centrifuge at 4 °C. Remove and discard supernatant carefully, so as not to disturb pellet. Add 25 µL of cold 75% ethanol and spin for 5 min at 4 °C.\nRemove carefully and discard the supernatant. Let pellet air dry for at least 5 min at RT. Do not let over dry. Add 12 µL of nuclease free Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer (pH 7.0) and keep the sample on ice.\nMeasure the RNA concentration with a spectrophotometer. 0.5- 1 µg/µL is usually obtained.",
    "Prepare 100 ng/µL mRNA in phenol red solution (0.5% phenol red in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline -DPBS) and aliquot for single use (3-5 µL). Store the mRNA aliquots at - 80 °C.\nMicroinjection of mRNA\n\t\nOn the day of injection, use one of the mRNA aliquots and follow the zebrafish embryo injection protocol to inject 1 nL of the mRNA into the one-cell stage embryos through their yolk19. A brief description is provided below.\nBreed adult fish and collect embryos as previously described20.\nPull microinjection needles with pipette puller. Cut the tip of the needles with forceps to create a 10 µm tip opening.\nAlign embryos in an injection mold that was described in Step 1.6.\nInject 1 nL of the mRNA in phenol red with a glass microinjection pipette.\nCollect embryos and keep them in E3 media.\nKeep embryos in the 27 °C incubator in E3 media until the desired developmental stage is achieved. Injected embryos can be used for both in vitro (section 3 and section 4) and in vivo imaging (section 5). Embryos expressing roGFP2-Orp1 can be pre-selected prior to experiments with a regular dissection microscope equipped with fluorescent light and a blue/green filter set.\n3. Primary retinal ganglion cell culture derived from zebrafish embryos\nNOTE: This protocol is adapted from a previously published method 21. Perform steps 3.1 and 3.2 in a laminar flow hood.\nPreparation of coverslips\n\t\nPrepare 4-6 culture plates in each experiment. Use acid-cleaned coverslips (22 x 22 mm square; 0.16-0.19 mm thickness) that are stored in 100% ethanol.\nRemove one coverslip from the storage container by using forceps and flame it to remove residual ethanol.\nAir dry the coverslip completely by placing it at an angle inside a 35-mm culture dish.",
    "Prepare Poly-D-Lysine (PDL) working solution (1x) by diluting 10x stock (5 mg/mL) in sterile water.\nApply 100 µL of 0.5 mg/mL PDL to the center of each coverslip and avoid spreading of the solution to the edges.\nIncubate the PDL on coverslips for 20-30 min at room temperature (RT). Make sure the PDL does not dry out.\nWash the PDL with 0.5 mL sterile water three times. Let the plates dry completely.\nPrepare laminin working solution (1x) by diluting 50x stock (1 mg/mL) in 1x PBS.\nApply 100 µL of 20 µg/mL laminin in PBS to the center of each coverslip and avoid the spread of solution to the edges.\nIncubate the plates at 37 °C in a humidified incubator for 2-6 h. Avoid drying of the laminin solution.\nEmbryo dissection and plating RGCs\n\t\nPrepare and label four 35-mm tissue culture dishes and fill with 4 mL of: 70% ethanol, \"E2 media 1\", \"E2 media 2\", \"E2 media 3\" on the day of dissection. Keep the dishes in the fridge until dissections.\nWhen zebrafish embryos are 34 hours post fertilization (hpf), take the culture dishes coated with laminin out of the incubator and wash the coverslips three times with 0.5 mL of 1x PBS.\nAfter the final wash, add 4 mL of ZFCM(+) media to each culture dish and avoid drying the plate.\nRetrieve the prepared culture dishes from Step 3.2.1. Let them equilibrate to RT.\nFill 4-6 PCR tubes with 15 µL of ZFCM(+) media. One tube is needed to prepare RGCs from 4 eyes to be plated onto one coverslip.\nRetrieve zebrafish embryos from the incubator and immerse embryos in 35 mm tissue culture dish containing 70% ethanol for 5-10 s to sterilize.",
    "Using a transfer pipette, transfer embryos to E2 Media 1 dish containing sterile E2 media to wash excess ethanol.\nTransfer embryos to E2 Media 2 dish and remove their chorions with sharp forceps.\nTransfer embryos to final E2 Media 3 dish to perform dissections.\nUsing a pair of fine forceps, dissect out the retinas as previously described 22.\nPosition and hold embryos anterior to their yolk with one of the forceps and remove the tail posterior to the yolk sac with the other forceps.\nGrab the neck with forceps and take off the head to expose brain and eyes to the E2 media. Avoid cutting the yolk sac.\nWith the tip of fine forceps, gently roll the eyes off from the head, while holding the cranial tissue down with the second forceps. Keep eyes isolated from the adjacent tissue debris.\nTransfer four eyes to one of the previously-prepared tubes containing ZFCM(+).\nGently titrate up and down with the P20 pipette and a yellow tip about 45 times to dissociate cells. Avoid any air bubbles.\nTransfer the ZFCM(+) with dissociated cells to the center of the coverslip. Repeat steps 10-12 for additional coverslips.\nMaintain cultures on benchtop at 22 °C on a polystyrene foam rack to absorb vibrations.\nPerform imaging 6-24 h after plating.\n\t\t​NOTE: Use transfer pipette to translocate embryos to different culture dishes. Change the pipette for each solution to prevent carrying over ethanol (Steps 6-8).\n4. In vitro ROS imaging of cultured RGC neurons\nOn the day of imaging (typically 6-24 h after cell plating), check cells under microscope to validate growth of RGC axons.\nFor live-cell imaging, transfer coverslips from culture dish to a live cell imaging chamber. In this case a custom-made open chamber, which has been previously described was used23.",
    "Set up microscope for imaging. Use an inverted microscope equipped with a differential interference contrast (DIC) objective, OG590 long-pass red filter, and an EM-CCD camera.\nBefore imaging, replace the ZFCM(+) medium with ZFCM(-).\nOnce cells are positioned with 10x objective, acquire images at 60x magnification using a high NA oil immersion objective. Use an additional 1.5x magnification.\nFirst, acquire DIC images. Then, image roGFP2-Orp1 using an appropriate filter set. Excite roGFP2-Orp1 with 405/20 and 480/30 nm excitation filters sequentially and acquire images with 535/30 nm emission filter after emission light has passed the dichroic mirror 505DCXR.\nAfter taking the first set of images, exchange media with media containing different treatment solutions. Media should be changed every 30 min of imaging to avoid pH and osmolarity changes.\n5. In vivo ROS imaging of developing embryos\nFor in vivo imaging, keep embryos in E3 media containing 0.003% Phenylthiourea (PTU) without methylene blue from 22-24 hpf. Exchange media and remove dead embryos on a daily basis.\nAt the desired age, anesthetize embryos in 0.016% tricaine. Mount anesthetized embryos in 1% low-melting agarose on 35-mm glass bottom culture dishes. Embryos can be oriented dorsally, ventrally or laterally, depending on the region of interest for imaging.\nAfter agarose solidifies, fill the dishes with E3 media without methylene blue/0.016% tricaine.\nSet up the microscope for imaging. Use an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope. Alternatively, use an upright confocal microscope equipped with a water immersion lens to image embryos mounted on top of an agarose drop.\nExcite roGFP2-Orp1 with 405 nm and 488 nm excitation filters sequentially and acquire corresponding images with emission filters in the range of 515-535 nm.\nAcquire z-stacks with 5 µm section thickness through the desired part of the embryos. Embryos can be kept for imaging at later stages of development.",
    "After imaging, remove embryos from agarose with fine forceps and keep in the incubator until desired age in methylene blue-free media with PTU.\n6. Image analysis and processing\nMeasurement of H2O2 levels based on 405/480 ratio values\n\t\nUse a suitable software for image analysis. ImageJ software was used here for image analysis and processing.\nOpen DIC, 405/535 and 480/535 images in ImageJ software by either dragging the files or clicking File | Open. If not already done, convert images to 32-bit by clicking Image | Type | 32-bit.\nDefine region of interest (ROI) with free hand tool from the control bar (cell body, growth cone, retina, etc.). Open the ROI manager by clicking Analyze | Tools | ROI Manager. Click Add in the ROI Manager tab to add the defined ROI.\nDraw a region close to ROI and add as background ROI. Measure average background values by selecting the ROI and clicking Measure from the ROI manager tab.\nNote the average intensity values from the measurement. Subtract the value of average background from the fluorescent images by clicking Process | Math | Subtract. Perform this step for both 405/535 and 480/535 images.\nAdd value of \"1\" to 480/535 fluorescent image to eliminate \"0\" values by clicking Process | Math | Add function prior to ratio calculation.\nClick Process | Image Calculator | Divide function in ImageJ to divide 405/535 image by 480/535 image pixel-by-pixel. Select 405/535 image to be divided by 480/535 image. Select a 32-bit output image.\nApply ROI to ratio image by first clicking the ratio image and then the ROI in the ROI manager tab.\nMeasure average ratio values of 405/535 image to 480/535 image by clicking Measure in the ROI manager tab.",
    "Do steps 6.1.2-6.1.9 for as many samples as possible to perform the appropriate statistical analysis.\nDisplaying ratio image\n\tNOTE: This procedure is to subtract the background outside the specimen and apply a color look-up table to the image.\n\t\nOnce the ratio image has been created in ImageJ in step 6.1.7., create a 32-bit black image by clicking File | New | Image.\nApply the ROI you would like to display H2O2 levels for to the new image by first clicking the new image and then the ROI from the ROI manager tab.\nCreate a mask by clicking Edit | Selection | Create Mask.\nDivide mask image by 255 to adjust ROI value to \"1\" and background values will be \"0\". Click Process | Math | Divide and type 255.\nMultiply mask with the ratio image by clicking Process | Image Calculator | Multiply function. This will result in a gray-scale ratio image showing only the ROI.\nChange look up table to \"Fire\" by clicking Image | Look up Tables | Fire.\n\t\tNOTE: A multiplication factor can be applied to all images for better visualization of the ratio by clicking Process | Image | Multiply.\nConvert the ratio image to 8-bit by clicking Image | Type | 8-bit.\nAdd calibration bar by clicking Analyze | Tools | Calibration Bar.\nSubscription Required.
