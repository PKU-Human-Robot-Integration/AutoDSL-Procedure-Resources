    "1. IPL Video Creation\nWe design the videos to be interesting and attractive, but also non-aversive to young children with autism, in a number of ways: When animate characters are needed, we use animals rather than humans to make the scenes less socially/emotionally challenging for children with ASD. We use dynamic scenes with brightly colored objects to capture and hold attention. A red blinking light during the intertrial intervals (ITIs) holds the children's attention when the video screens are blank. We produce the voice audio using speech that is exaggerated in both intonation and duration to capture and hold the children's attention.\nFigure 1. (Movie) One block of the Noun Bias video. Shows one block of the Noun Bias video, which tests whether children map a novel word onto an object vs. an action.

The baseline trials tell us whether the children have any inherent or visual preference for either stimulus when there is no linguistic or directing audio.\nThe test trials appear last, paired with the test audios that distinguish the two visuals.\nA 1kHz tone goes on the second audio channel, coincident with each trial, providing visual designation to coders of the onset and offset of trials.\n2. At the Visit/Child's Home",
    "Perform the consent process with the parent. Describe the study format in more detail and ask parent to sign the consent forms. Emphasize that the child should watch with minimal interaction with the parent, and introduce the mp3 player for the parent to use, if the child is to sit on the parent's lap. The parent listens to music on the mp3 player while watching the IPL video, so that s/he does not hear the IPL test audio and so potentially influence which way the child should look.\nSet up the IPL components in the designated room, and connect to power sources using extension cords. It is helpful to bring a research assistant along who can play with the child during setup. Set up the big screen with its back to the major light source. Place the speaker centered behind the screen; adjust both volume knobs to halfway levels. Place the camera on the tripod atop the tone adaptor box, centered in front of screen. Load the tape into the camera and place the DTE on the floor next to the camera. Set up the projector stand 7-10 feet away from the screen; place the projector on top. Place the laptop next to the projector stand.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4331/4331fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. The portable IPL components and the arrangement of their setup in the home.

    "Connect the IPL components: Connect the laptop so that it sends video signal to the projector. The laptop also sends out two audio signals (via a splitter), with the voice audio going to the speaker and the tone audio going to the camera. Connect the camera so that it sends video and audio signal to the DTE. Once connected, power up all components. The DTE screen should show \"AVI Type 1\" on left and \"Counter\" underneath.\nPlay the video(s) for the child: Load the first video on the laptop into Quicktime.\n\t\nPlace a chair 2.5 to 3 feet from camera, in front of screen. Invite the child to sit on the chair, or on the parent's lap. If on parent's lap, give the parent the mp3 player and earbuds, tell her/him to start it. If child sits alone, parent may sit alongside. Children who get fidgety during the video may be encouraged in general terms to \"watch the movie.\"\nEnsure that the child's face is visible in the camcorder. Re-check whenever the child moves around. Adjust lighting in room as needed.\nWrite child's information on a dry erase whiteboard (pseudonym, gender, visit, video, date, birthdate, age).Turn on camcorder and press record. Press record on DTE. Film the whiteboard for 10 sec.\nOn the laptop, play the first video by clicking \"View\" followed by \"Enter Full Screen.\"\nAfter the video is completed, press the stop button on the DTE. If the child is willing, another video may be presented. Alternatively, this may be a good time for a break. Some children with ASD may need frequent breaks, but others may prefer to view all of the videos in a row.\nReward children with a gift at the end of the visit.\n3. Coding Back in the Lab",
    "Check that the child's eye movements are already digitized on the DTE.\n\t\nImport this film into a nonlinear editing program, convert to the format (.avi) used by our custom coding program, and then export to a secure storage device.\nCode each video following its specific layout (i.e,. arrangement of familiarization/teaching, baseline, and test trials).\n\t\nTab through the child's film and find the frames where the waveform of the 1kHz tone is visible, indicating that a visual stimulus is being presented to the child.\nBegin coding during the intertrial interval (ITI) before each target trial (i.e., there's no tone and the centering light is presented; the child should be centering or looking away). Tab ahead frame by frame, recording each change of gaze as L (to the left), R (to the right), C (to the center) or A (away: up, down, far left, far right, back).\nThe coding program outputs columns of numbers indicating the timing and type of each code entered. So, TSC 33499 means that at the onset of the trial, 3.3499 sec from the start of the video, the child looked to the center.\nThe coding arrays are analyzed by a custom matlab analysis program, which accesses the specific layout-which side is the match for each trial-of each video.\nThe analysis programs then calculate the child's duration and direction of looking during each coded trial, the child's latency to first look at the matching stimulus, and the number of times the child switches attention during each coded trial.\nWe then compare children's looking during the baseline vs. test trials on (a) duration of gaze to the matching image, (b) latency of first look to the matching image, (c) timecourse of looking to both images during the entire trial, and (d) number of switches of attention.",
    "The rationale is that children who understand the linguistic stimulus will look longer at the matching image during the test trial than they had during the baseline trial, that they will look more quickly (once the trial begins) at the matching image than the nonmatching image, and that they will switch attention less during the test trials than during the baseline trials, because the linguistic stimulus is guiding their looking.\nThe only difference between baseline and test trials is the linguistic audio; the visual stimuli are the same but the baseline trials have a nondirecting audio (e.g., \"look here!\") while the test trials have a directing audio (e.g., \"Where's toopen?\") Therefore, comparing test trials to baseline trials for the duration and switches of attention measures tells us how much the directing audio is guiding the children's looking patterns. Also, if the children understand the directing audio, they should look more quickly at the matching image than at the nonmatching image."
