    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nStep 1: Plate Lamp1-mGFP-expressing HeLa cells on clean, sterile coverslips\nTiming: ∼1 h\nLamp1-mGFP-expressing HeLa cells are seeded on coverslips to allow cell handling in the following steps of the protocol and to allow visualization by confocal microscopy.\nTrypsinize cells in exponential growth phase, between passage 3 and 20.\nGently remove culture medium.\nWash cells 1 time with pre-warmed PBS (rapid wash).\nAdd trypsin (or any detaching solution) and put cells in the incubator.\nCritical: at the end of trypsinization, make sure cells are at a single-cell level by looking at them under the microscope. Computational analysis becomes difficult if cells form clusters on the coverslip.\nResuspend trypsinized cells in culture medium and remove trypsin by gentle centrifugation and subsequent aspiration of medium.\nResuspend cell pellet in an appropriate volume of culture medium, or at a desired cell concentration.\nPrepare coverslips.\nBy using appropriate forceps, put sterile coverslips at the bottom of the well(s).\nCritical: We recommend using round 10mm coverslips for 24-multiwell plates or 13mm for 12-multiwell plates, which will minimize any issue (i.e.: breakage, overlay) during their handling. Coverslips must be clean; if they are not, clean them with 1% Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS), followed by extensive washes with deionized water. Moreover, coverslips must be sterile; if they are not, sterilize them at 200°C for 2h in a heater.\nWash the coverslips 1 time with 1× PBS. Make sure they adhere to the bottom of the well(s) by gently pushing them with sterile forceps after cell seeding.\nCritical: This step is crucial to ensure cells do not grow below the coverslips.\nPlate cells on coverslips.\nSeed cells to have about 50% confluency.",
    "Critical: Do not seed too many cells, if characterized by a high growing rate, as the over-confluency will hamper the consequent computational analysis.\nOn the same line, spread cells properly by extensively moving the multi-well (or whichever type of plastic support you are using) in multiple directions, to avoid the formation of cell clusters.\nCoverslips can be coated with specific adhesion agents depending on the cell type used.\nUsing a sterile tip, push gently the coverslips to the bottom of the well since you want cells to adhere on top of the coverslip.\nPut cells in the humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 16 h before proceeding.\nStep 2: Treat cells with amino acid analogs\nTiming: ∼3 h\nAmino acid analogs are methyl ester group-bearing amino acids, which cause the rapid, osmosis-driven, expansion of lysosomes. We tested three types of such compounds on cells (individually): L-Leucine methyl ester hydrochloride, L-Alanine methyl ester hydrochloride, L-Histidine methyl ester hydrochloride. L-Leucine methyl ester hydrochloride caused the strongest effect in our cell models.\nTreat cells with amino acid analog.\nDilute amino acid analog stock solution in culture medium at the desired concentration.\nNote: The expansion effect is dose and time-dependent. Use a working concentration between 1mM (mild expansion) and 10mM (maximum expansion) up to at least 2h of incubation to reach the maximum effect. Moreover, if you are using phenol red-containing medium, you will notice a change in color towards yellow. Indeed, amino acid analogs are slightly acidic compounds.\nTake cells from point 6d and gently remove culture medium.\nAdd culture medium supplemented with amino acid analogs and put back cells in the incubator for 2 h.\nNote: After having removed culture medium (7b) add the one containing amino acids analogs (7c) without introducing any further cell starvation step.\nCell fixation",
    "Timing: ∼30 min\nFixation is the most critical step of the protocol. The membrane of expanded lysosomes is extremely fragile, and their morphology can be strongly affected by the fixation method. Hence, the aim of this section is to describe a detailed protocol based on three different fixation procedures, which allows to preserve at its best the lysosomal morphology.\nMethanol-based fixation procedure:\nPour pure methanol in a multi-well or in any kind of plastic support you need to use.\nPut methanol-containing multi-well at −20°C in a fridge.\nWait approximately for 15 min.\nPut multi-well from 6d on ice.\nUsing the appropriate forceps, transfer coverslips-containing cells into cold methanol.\nWait 5 min.\nCritical: Do not extend fixation time over 5 min, as the methanol fixation also promotes membranes permeabilization and, as such, a longer exposure could eventually affect per se the lysosomal morphology.\nAspirate methanol and wash with 1× PBS by 4 or 5 rapid washes before proceeding with immunostaining step or confocal microscopy analysis.\nGlutaraldehyde-based fixation procedure:\nAspirate culture medium and wash the cells one time with 1× PBS at room temperature (Alcantara-Ortigoza et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nFix the cells by adding a mixture of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and 0.05% glutaraldehyde (GA) prepared in 0.2M HEPES buffer for 10 min (Alcantara-Ortigoza et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nWash the cells once with 4% PFA (prepared in 0.2M HEPES buffer) to remove the residual GA and fix them again by adding 4% PFA and incubate them at RT for 30 min.\nWash the cells three time with 1× PBS solution before proceeding with immunostaining step or microscopy analysis.\nCritical: Upon fixation, cells can be stored at 4°C for few days. If a longer period is needed, it is recommended to seal up the multi-well plate with Parafilm to avoid any evaporation of the PBS solution.",
    "Formaldehyde-based fixation procedure:\nAspirate culture medium and wash the cells one time with 1× PBS at RT.\nFix the cells by adding formaldehyde solution (3.7% in 1× PBS) and let it to act for 30 min at RT.\nDuring incubation, prepare the glycine-based blocking solution (0.1M Gly in 1× PBS). This solution must be freshly prepared and cooled in ice before use.\nAspirate fixation solution and replace it with glycine-based blocking solution. Incubate on ice for 5 min.\nWash the cells two times with 1× PBS before proceeding with the immunostaining protocol.\nCell immunostaining of lysosomal endogenous proteins\nTiming: ∼3 h\nThis section describes the immunostaining method for the endogenous lysosomal marker Lamp1 protein. This is a critical step for both the visualization of enlarged lysosomes by means of confocal microscopy and for the quantitative analysis of their morphological changes (i.e.,: number, size, diameter).\nIn our study, we used anti-Lamp1 antibody to visualize the lysosomal compartment.\nAfter having treated cells with amino acid analogs and proceeded with fixation protocol, cells were permeabilized by using blocking buffer (0.05% saponin, 1% bovine serum albumin in 1× PBS) for 15 min at RT.\nNote: Methanol fixation method already promotes cell permeabilization. Thus, step 6a can be omitted.\nDuring the blocking step, dilute at a 1:500 ratio the anti-Lamp1 antibody in blocking buffer.\nWash cells once with 1× PBS at 25°C.\nMix the diluted antibody by inverting or vortexing, and spin down for a second.\nPrepare a rectangle of parafilm on the working bench by spreading a few drops of water between the parafilm and the bench to let it to adhere.",
    "Add 50 μL of the diluted primary antibody solution on the parafilm. This volume is appropriate for 10 mm and 13 mm coverslips. Add more volume for larger coverslips. The right volume is the one that allows the coverslip to float on the drop.\nGently put the coverslip upside-down with the cells in contact with the drops of antibody-containing solution and incubate for 1 h at RT.\nNote: This drop-based protocol allows one to reduce the consumption of the antibody for each experiment, yet without influencing the efficacy and/or reproducibility of the procedure.\nCritical: Before positioning the coverslip on the drops, remove the excess PBS solution that is still adsorbed on the coverslip by letting it touch the surface of a piece of adsorbing paper. This step is fundamental to avoid any further and undesired dilution of the antibody.\nAfte the incubation with primary antibody, add 150 μL of 1× PBS between parafilm and coverslip to let it float on the drops.\nCritical: This step is instrumental for transferring back coverslips from Parafilm to multi-well without damaging or leaving cells on the Parafilm bedding.\nWash cells three times with 1× PBS for 5 min each.\nDilute the Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies at a ratio of 1:500 using blocking buffer.\nMix the diluted secondary antibodies by inverting or vortexing, and spin down for a second.\nAdd 50 μL drops of the diluted secondary antibodies solution.\nCritical: Incubation with secondary antibodies must be performed in the dark. Cover the coverslips with a cover to protect them from light and prevent photobleaching.\nIncubate for 45 min at RT.\nWash cells three times with 1× PBS 5 min each.\nAdd 10 μL of mounting solution on the slide.",
    "Dip coverslips in sterile water before putting them on the drop of mounting solution to remove any trace of salts.\nLet them dry in a dark chamber before proceeding with microscopy analysis.\nStep 3: Confocal microscopy acquisition\nTiming: 1 day\nIn this section we describe in detail the setting and acquisition mode applicable to either living or fixed cells by using the Ultraview VoX spinning disk system (PerkinElmer) (D'Agostino et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; D'Agostino et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; D'Agostino et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) or the LSM700 confocal system (Carl Zeiss) (D'Agostino et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; D'Agostino et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]), respectively. The protocol described here is applicable for any fluorescent molecule excitable at 488 nm (such as a GFP, FITC, Alexa Fluor 488, etc.), as well as for other fluorescent molecules excitable at any other different wavelengths.\nLive-imaging acquisition procedure: This section of the protocol describes the visualization of the exogenous lysosomal marker Lamp1-mGFP protein. For the live-based visualization, cells must be grown in multi-well with glass-bottom and the microscope must be equipped with a dedicated chamber necessary to maintain temperature and CO2 at 37°C and 5%, respectively.\nSwitch on the microscope and set up parameters to the thermostatic chamber to let it reach the selected temperature and CO2.\nAll samples are observed by using an oil immersion objective (63× 1.4 NA).\nThe channel is set to 488-nm laser by using the Ultraview VoX spinning disk software.\nAdjust the laser power and time exposure. For this study, the variables were adjusted as follows: laser power at 50% and time exposure between 200 and 500 ms.\nResearchers should optimize the settings for optimal image intensity.\nAfter capturing, images can be processed using the Ultraview VoX spinning disk software to adjust their intensity.\nCapture images from at least 20 different fields for the quantification of lysosomal diameter.",
    "Acquired images are saved as .Tiff, .JPG or .PNG formats and can be visualized for quantitative analysis by using the ImageJ Fiji software.\nAcquisition procedure from fixed cells: This section describes the visualization of stained cells to analyze the endogenous lysosomal marker Lamp1 protein. All images are acquired by confocal microscopy. To use LSM700 software, researchers need to refer to the manufacturer’s manual for the Zeiss LSM700 instrument.\nAll samples are observed using a confocal microscope equipped with a 63× or 40× 1.4 NA oil immersion objective. The observation can be made even with a non-confocal microscope.\nCritical: Do not use non-oil objectives. The oil is necessary to improve the resolving power of the microscope which is crucial to get high-resolution images that allow the best estimation of the dimension from the smallest to the largest lysosomal structures.\nThe channel is set to 488-nm laser by using the LSM700 Zeiss software.\nAdjust the pinhole, laser power, PMT gain, and offset. For this study, the variables were adjusted as follows: pinhole at 0,42 A.U., laser power at 2.0, PMT gain between 500 and 700, and the offset at −20.\nResearchers should optimize the settings for optimal image intensity varying and keeping laser power or PMT gain always under the maximum before bleaching. Anyway, the instructions we have provided on the Lamp1-mGFP expressing cells, the antibody against Lamp1, and the fixation procedures guarantee the optimal outcome which can be easily reached also with other acquisition systems including the non-confocal ones.\nAfter capturing, images can be processed using LSM700 Zeiss software to adjust their intensity.\nCapture images from at least 20 different fields of three independent experiments. For a good statistically significant quantification, one need to analyze at least 50 lysosomal diameters for 20 cells/experiment for a total of 3000 lysosomal diameters.",
    "Acquired images are saved as “.lsm5” format and can be opened using LSM700 or ImageJ Fiji software. Images can then be exported to the .Tiff, .JPG, .PNG, and many others for the post-processing analysis."
