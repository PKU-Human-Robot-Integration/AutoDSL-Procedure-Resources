    "FVB/NJ mice were bred in the animal facility of Key Laboratory of Hebei Neurology. All mouse experiments were approved by the Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University Ethics Committee and carried out according to the regulations of laboratory animal management promulgated by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China.\n1. Preparation of 20% Lidocaine Hydrochloride Stock Solution\nWeigh 2 g of lidocaine hydrochloride. Add 5–6 mL of sterile water and vortex gently. Increase the volume to a total of 10 mL with sterile water.\n1.2 Filter the stock solution through 0.2-micron filters. Aliquot the stock solution, 1 mL per 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube,and seal it with a sealing film. Store at 4 °C.\n2. Direct Intrathecal AAV Delivery in Awake Mice\nWipe the work area using sterile gauze with 70% ethanol and prepare the required supplies as mentioned in Table 1.\nPrepare 100 µL of AAVrh.10/1% lidocaine hydrochloride complex by adding 95 µL of rAAVrh10 stock solution (5 x 1012 genome copies/mL) into a sterile 200 µL microcentrifuge tube, and add 5 µL of 20% lidocaine hydrochloride stock solution. Mix well by pipetting up and down. Then, store the virus solution on ice (4 °C).\nNOTE: 8 µL per mouse4 will be used.\nPreparing the syringe with AAV solution for injection\nAssemble a 25 µL Hamilton syringe with a 27 G needle and align the beveled tip of the needle with the volumetric scale on the syringe.\nDraw 8 µL with 4 x 1010 genome copies of the virus solution into the syringe gently.Make sure to remove air bubbles.\nPreparing the mouse\n\tNOTE: Male or female FVB/NJ mice (30–70 days old) were used in this study. IT injection was operated in the hood.",
    "Sterilize the work area in a hood with 70% ethanol. Put the awake mouse (male or female, 30–70 days old, 13–20 g weight) on a bedpiece in a prone position in the hood. Cover the upper body with sterile gauze to calm the mouse and avoid being bitten.\nFix the animal by gripping appropriately and firmly on its pelvic girdle with a thumb on one side and forefinger/middle finger on the other side. Keep the skin between bilateral pelvic girdles taut with the thumb and forefinger. Hold gently on the upper body of the animal with the palm.\nShave the fur on its back between the bilateral pelvic girdles, then sterilize the skin surface with an iodide-based scrub and 70% ethanol.\nIntrathecal Injection12\nFeel the intervertebral space along the middle line between the bilateral pelvic girdles with a thumb or forefinger of the other hand and press an indentation with a fingernail to indicate the L5-L6 intervertebral space (locate the injection site).\nRotate the base of the tail slightly and gently to indicate the midline of the spine. Adjust the needle bevel towards the head of the animal before injection (mentioned in step 2.3.1).\nMake sure that the animals are fixed firmly and align the needle along the midline of spine.\nInsert the needle gently and vertically (or tilt slightly 70–80°) in the intersection of indentation and keep the syringe in a central sagittal plane. Reduce the angle to approximately 30° slowly when it connects the bone, then slip the needle into the intervertebral space.",
    "NOTE: An evident sudden tail flick is a sign of successful entry into the intradural space. Once the needle enters the intervertebral space, the needle tip will feel firmly clamped. The 27 G needle used in this study is suited for IT delivery in mice but not rats.\nInject the vector solution(mentioned in step 2.2). Start the timer and inject 8 µL of the vector solution at a speed of 1 µL/4 s. Retain the needle approximately 1 min after finishing delivery. Withdraw the needle with gentle rotation to avoid leaking.\nScore the transient weakness of the mouse limbs immediately after delivery to evaluate the injection quality4.\nNOTE: The standard is as follows4. Score 0: no weakness; score 1: minor weakness of the hind limbs without gait abnormality; score 2: moderate weakness of the hind limbs with obvious gait abnormality; score 3: complete paralysis of the hind limbs; score 4: complete paralysis of the hind limbs, shortness of breath, and moderate weakness of the fore limbs; and score 5: complete paralysis of all four limbs and evident shortness of breath.\nMove the mouse back to the cage for recovery from paralysis.\nClean-up\nFlush the syringe with 1 mL sterile water. Sort laboratory supplies and collect all non-disposable materials for autoclaved sterilization. Clean the bench with 70% ethanol.\n3. Tissue Preparation for Immunohistochemical Staining\nTissue collection\nAnesthetize mice at 21 days post-injection with 3% chloral hydrate (0.1 mL/10 g) deeply by intraperitoneal injection.\nPerfuse transcardially with 20 mL of ice-cold 0.01 M PBS (NaCl 147 mM; NaH2PO4 1.9 mM; K2HPO4 8.1 mM, pH 7.4) firstly, then 4% ice-cold paraformaldehyde (in 0.01 M PBS) with pump (10 mL/min for 1 min, then 5 mL/min for 9 min).",
    "CAUTION: Paraformaldehyde is carcinogenic and toxic. Handle it only in the fume hood while wearing gloves.\nDissection of the spinal cord and brain\nFix the limbs and head of each animal in a prone position on a foam box cover with syringe needles, then strip and remove the skin from the head to sacrum with scissors.\nClip the skull between eyes, cut alongside the middle route of the skull and horizontal line upon the cerebellum, then open the skull to each side.\nLift the occipital bone with tweezers and open the spinal canal bilaterally with ophthalmic scissors. Cut off the ribs on both sides and remove the upper half of vertebrae carefully.\nLift the brain with curved tweezers and sever the nerves of the skull base, then dissect out the whole brain and spinal cord carefully. Post-fix the tissues in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h.\nPreparation of tissue slices\nCryoprotect the brain and cervical and lumbar spinal cord in 30% sucrose solution overnight at 4 °C. Embed the tissue in optimum cutting temperature (OCT) compound and freeze fast with liquid nitrogen.\nCut the tissue at 25 µm using a cryostat and store the frozen sections in 0.01 M PBS at 4 °C for use .\n4. Immunohistochemistry\nPretreat free-floating sections in 1% H2O2 for 10 min, then wash in PBS for 10 min. Incubate in a blocking solution containing 5% serum and 0.3% non-ionic detergent in PBS for 1 h.\nIncubate the slices with corresponding primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Wash the sections in PBST (0.2% Tween 20 in PBS) for 30 min (3 times for 10 min each).\nIncubate the slices with corresponding biotin-secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. Wash in PBST for 30 min (3 times for 10 min each).",
    "Incubate the sections with affinity biotin peroxidase complex for 40 min, and stain with achromogenic agent. Mount the sections onto slides and dry properly.\nSoak the slides in anhydrous ethanol for 5 min and xylene for 10 min, then seal the slides with a mounting medium. Finally, image the slides with a microscope equipped with a charge-coupled device (CCD) at 100x, 200x, and 400x magnifications.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
