    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nEmbryo collection, fixation, and dehydration\nTiming: ∼24 h\nThis part describes the collection of mouse embryonic samples for whole-mount HCR RNA-FISH. Samples are fixed in 4% formaldehyde prepared in PBS to preserve tissue integrity and allow long-term storage in 100% Methanol.\nNote: The fixation time depends on the size and age of the embryos or other biological samples of interest. Suppose optimal fixation times for a given tissue are not known. In that case, empirically determine the time in a test experiment. The following protocol works well for mouse embryos fixed for 12–16 h ranging from embryonic days E9.5 to E13.5.\nEuthanize mice and collect embryos according to the institutional ethical committee guidelines.\nDissect and wash embryos in ice-cold PBS buffer to remove as much blood as possible.\nFixation and dehydration\nTransfer freshly dissected embryos to a glass vial.\nAdd minimally 5 mL of ice-cold 4% PFA in 1x PBS (pH 7.4).\nPlace the glass vial on a rotating or gently rocking platform for 12–16 h at 4°C to fix the embryos.\nRemove the fixative solution carefully.\nWash with 5 mL 1x PBS minimally 3 times for 5 min.\nWash 2 times 5 min in PBST.\nNote: Store PBST at room temperature (24°C).\nRemove PBST and dehydrate the embryos in the Methanol (MeOH) dehydration series for 10 min each at room temperature (24°C) on a rocking platform. Using 5 mL per tube for each step:\n25% MeOH / 75% PBST.\n50% MeOH / 50% PBST.\n75% MeOH / 25% PBST.\n100% MeOH.\n100% MeOH.\nCritical: Both PFA and Methanol are hazardous toxic substances. Therefore, work under a laminar flow chemical hood and strictly follow institutional safety and correct waste disposal guidelines.\nPause point: Keep dehydrated embryos in 100% Methanol at -20°C for long-term storage.",
    "Note: The following whole-mount HCR RNA-FISH protocol works well with embryos fixed with 4% PFA for 12–16 h at 4°C and then stored in 100% methanol at -20°C up to a year.\nRemove the 100% Methanol and rehydrate the embryos in the methanol rehydration series for 10 min each at room temperature (24°C) using a rocking platform. Using minimally 5 mL per tube for each step:\n75% MeOH / 25% PBST.\n50% MeOH / 50% PBST.\n25% MeOH / 75% PBST.\n100% PBST.\n100% PBST.\nNote: Proper embryo dehydration and rehydration are essential before proceeding to the next step.\nIf necessary, dissect the embryonic tissues, such as limb buds.\nTransfer the dissected tissue in PBST into individual wells of a 24-well tissue culture plate.\nWash two times for 5 min in 1 mL PBS.\nNote: For limb buds, we remove as much trunk tissue as possible, which allows for a minimal volume of the HCR probe and amplifier and facilitates the mounting of samples for imaging. Alternatively, increase the volumes of all solutions and the probe and amplifier concentrations as required.\nOxidation-mediated autofluorescence reduction (OMAR)\nTiming: ∼2 h 30 min\nIn this step, OMAR photochemical bleaching of mouse embryonic limb buds eliminates or significantly reduces tissue and blood vessel autofluorescence in mouse limb buds prior to proceeding with whole-mount HCR RNA-FISH.",
    "Note: Hydrogen peroxide is the most widely used pigment decoloring/bleaching agent, known to degrade the pigment (such as heme, lipofuscin, melanin, etc.) and the protein structure. Also, strong acids (e.g., acetone) and strong alkalis (e.g., NaOH) can dissociate heme structure, allowing efficient pigment bleaching. Photobleaching with strong UV or white light is routinely used on tissue sections. However, hydrogen peroxide, sodium hydroxide, or exposure to LED light alone is inefficient in obtaining the desired outcome on whole-mount tissue. The OMAR is based on light and base-catalyzed oxidation.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] The limb buds are immersed in the bleaching solution containing hydrogen peroxide and sodium hydroxide and exposed to an LED spotlight source (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) or LED light plates (20000 lumen, Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). Hydrogen peroxide combined with sodium hydroxide generates sodium peroxide and thus creates a strong oxidative environment. While exposition to the LED light not only excites the endogenous fluorescent molecules, it also ionizes biomolecules, generating intermediate reactive oxidation species (ROS).10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] The combined effect of H2O2 and NaOH in the solution and LED light improves tissue permeability. Additionally, ROS generated in the process oxidizes the heme and other biomolecules, which helps quench the background fluorescence across the visible spectrum.\nCritical: A successful photo-oxidation reaction manifests itself in microbubbles that grow in number and size during light exposure (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). It is important to note that the specific reaction and outcome may vary depending on factors such as the duration of exposure and the intensity and wavelength of LED lights and properties of tissue and organ. Overexposure may damage the tissue and cellular components; therefore, carefully optimize the reaction time and the number of cycles beforehand for the tissue of interest.\nCritical: The bleaching solution must be prepared fresh before use.\nRemove the PBS and add 1 mL Bleaching Solution.",
    "Expose the plate to intense LED light for 45 min.\nNote: Heat can damage the tissue and lead to undesirable results. Therefore, keep an approximately 2 cm–3 cm distance between the plate and light source to avoid sample heating. Avoid excessive space between the light source and samples, as it may slow the photochemical reaction (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nRemove the Bleaching Solution.\nWash the embryos twice with 1 mL PBS for 5 min at room temperature (24°C) on a rocking platform (20 oscillations/min).\nCritical: Carefully remove the Bleaching Solution and wash it with PBS. Gently add the PBS to avoid damaging the tissue. Also, be aware that the tissues, such as limb buds, may stick to the plastic wells (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nRemove the PBS and add 1 mL of freshly prepared Bleaching Solution.\nExpose the microwell plate to LED light for another 45 min.\nNote: In our hands, two rounds of photochemical bleaching are sufficient to reduce or eliminate autofluorescence on mouse embryonic limb buds. To find a suitable condition for embryonic tissue or organ of interest, we recommend that users perform a pilot photochemical bleaching experiment with at least three conditions (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]): 2 times 30 min, 2 times 45 min, and 4 times 30 min. One could also test 2 or 3 times 15 min for fragile tissues or smaller samples.\nRemove the Bleaching Solution and wash the limb buds/tissue samples at least three times with 1 mL PBST for 10 min each at room temperature (24°C) on a rocking platform.\nCritical: Check the limb buds/tissue samples under the microscope for any remaining bubbles. If bubbles persist, wash the samples longer in PBST with gentle shaking (300 rpm; see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nHCR RNA-FISH protocol\nTiming: ∼2.5 days",
    "This step describes the modified whole-mount HCR RNA-FISH protocol to circumvent the use of proteinase-K and the necessary post-fixation step, as this may affect tissue morphology and cause fixation-related autofluorescence.\nNote: The proteinase-K-based permeabilization is substituted by detergent-based tissue permeabilization that does not require post-fixation.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] In contrast to Bruce et al.,11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] the SDS concentration is increased to 4% for mouse limb buds. The volume of solutions, probe concentration, hairpin volume, and incubation times are optimized for 4–6 mouse limb buds per tube (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section, problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).\nNote: Store the detergent solution in the dark at room temperature (24°C). Maximally 1 month.\nTransfer the limb buds in 1 mL PBST to a clean 2 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nCarefully remove all PBST.\nReplace with 1 mL Detergent Solution, and incubate for 2 h at 37°C on a shaker at 300 rpm.\nRemove the Detergent Solution.\nWash the limb buds twice with 1 mL PBST for 5 min at room temperature (24°C).\nNote: For samples smaller than mouse limb buds at E10.5 and/or fragile epithelial tissues, consider reducing the SDS concentration to, e.g., 1% and/or the incubation time to 30 min or 1 h. Empirically determine the optimal SDS concentration and incubation time beforehand. Note that tissue permeabilization using an SDS-containing detergent solution also helps delipidation and facilitates optical clearing (step 25).\nRemove the PBST.\nEquilibrate the limb buds in 100 μL of Probe Hybridization buffer (Molecular Instruments) for 10 min at 24°C on a shaker at 300 rpm.\nDiscard the Probe Hybridization buffer.\nReplace it with 200 μL of pre-warmed (37°C) Probe Hybridization buffer for 1 h or longer at 37°C, 300 rpm.\nNote: The probe hybridization buffer volume depends on limb bud size and numbers per tube.",
    "Pause point: At this step, limb buds can be stored in Probe Hybridization buffer at -20°C for several months.\nMeanwhile, prepare the desired HCR probe mixes by adding 1 μL of each probe set (1 μM stock) to 100 μL of pre-warmed (37°C) Probe Hybridization buffer.\nRemove the pre-hybridization solution.\nReplace it with the prepared probe mixes (100 μL per tube).\nIncubate for 12–16 h at 37°C on a shaking platform set to 300 rpm at 37°C.\nRemove the probe mixes.\nAdd 200 μL of pre-warmed Probe Wash buffer (Molecular Instruments).\nPerform four washes with a pre-warmed Probe Wash buffer of 20 min each at 37°C with shaking at 300 rpm.\nNote: Recover and store the used probe mixes at -20°C to reuse. We have successfully reused probes at least two to three times.\nRemove the Probe Wash buffer.\nWash three times with 1 mL 5x SSCT (pH 7.4) for 20 min per wash at room temperature (24°C).\nNote: Store 5× SSCT at room temperature (24°C).\nRemove the 5x SSCT.\nAdd 200 μL of pre-equilibrated Amplification buffer (Molecular Instruments) for 5 min at 24°C.\nCritical: Pre-equilibrate the Amplification buffer at 24°C before use.\nReplace the Amplification buffer with 200 μL of fresh pre-equilibrated Amplification buffer.\nPre-amplify the limb bud samples for at least 1 h or more at 24°C.\nNote: Meanwhile, prepare the hairpins by heating H1 and H2 separately in separate tubes for 90 s at 95°C. Let them cool down to room temperature (24°C) for 30 min in a dark place. Mix hairpin H1 and H2 in the Amplification buffer. Per tube (containing 4–6 limb buds), use 2 μL of Hairpin H1 and H2 (3 μM stock) per fluorophore in 100 μL Amplification buffer. Protect the tubes from light.",
    "Critical: From this step onward, protect the samples in their tubes from light during all steps.\nReplace the Amplification buffer with 100 μL hairpin mix per tube.\nIncubate the limb buds for 12–16 h on a shaker (300 rpm) at 24°C. Protect the tubes from light.\nRecover the hairpin mixes.\nWash the limb buds three times 5 min with 1 mL 5x SSCT at room temperature (24°C) on a rocking platform (20 oscillations/min). Protect the tubes from light.\nNote: Do not discard the hairpin mixes; we have successfully reused hairpin mixes at least two to three times. Store in the dark at 4°C (for immediate reuse) or −20°C for long-term storage.\nTransfer the limb bud samples to a clean microcentrifuge tube. Protect the samples from light.\nWash the samples 6 times for 30 min each by incubating them in 1 mL 5x SSCT containing DAPI (diluted 1:1000 from the 1 mg/mL stock) on a rocking platform.\nNote: Store DAPI 1 mg/mL stock at -20°C in dark. DAPI staining is recommended as it helps to orient the samples during the mounting procedure (steps 26–28) for fluorescence microscopy. If DAPI is not required, wash samples 6 times with 5x SSCT.\nTransfer the limb buds to a new tube protected from light.\nWash 3 times for 5 min with 1 mL 5x SSCT (without DAPI).\nThe samples are ready for optical clearing and imaging.\nPause point: If required, store the samples in the dark in 5X SSCT solution for several days.\nOptical clearing and sample preparation for imaging\nTiming: ∼24 h",
    "This step describes the optical clearing preparation of samples for confocal and/or light sheet microscopy. The samples prepared using this protocol do not require further delipidation and depigmentation. A water-based, non-toxic fructose and glycerol clearing method is used for optical clearing and refractive index matching.12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]\nTransfer limb buds to a new multi-well plate. Protect the plate from light.\nAdd freshly prepared Fructose-Glycerol-Clearing solution.\nLet the tissue clear for 24 h at room temperature (24°C) on a rocking platform (20 oscillations/min).\nCritical: Maintaining a pH of 7.4 is essential for the stability of fluorophores and the long-term storage of HCR RNA-FISH samples. Changes in pH may impact the intensity or cause a complete loss of fluorescence signals.\nNote:  ∼24 h of clearing is sufficient for most embryonic samples of the size of limb buds up to E12.5. If necessary, extend the clearing time to 48–72 h. In this case, we recommend exchanging the clearing solution every 24 h with a freshly prepared Fructose-Glycerol-Clearing solution.\nMounting optically cleared samples for confocal imaging\nTiming: ∼10 min\nChoose the iSpacer of the desired thickness (depending on the thickness of the sample) and stick it on a glass microscope slide.\nPlace the sample in the middle in a drop of Fructose-Glycerol-Clearing solution.\nCarefully place a coverslip on the top, avoiding the formation and trapping of bubbles.\nUse the DAPI channel to visualize and orient the sample (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section, problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11]).\nCritical: Mounting samples require some training -use optically cleared test tissue samples to train.\nLet the samples settle for a few hours.\nImage the samples using a confocal microscope with the Z-stack scanning function for 3D imaging (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.13]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3016-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "(A–C) All limb buds shown in (A and B) are processed for and imaged by confocal microscopy without subsequent digital autofluorescence subtraction or masking. (A) Blood cell and blood vessel autofluorescence and probe penetration problems increase progressively with the more advanced stages of mouse limb bud development using a standard HCR RNA-FISH protocol (upper panels). In contrast, OMAR photobleaching in combination with SDS-detergent permeabilization reduces tissue autofluorescence improves probe penetration and signal-to-noise ratio at all stages analyzed (lower panels). (B) 3D reconstruction of the limb buds shown in the two rightmost images (lower panels in A) reveals the tissue integrity, even hybridization/signal detection, and very high signal-to-noise ratio throughout the limb buds. Scale bars: 300 μm. (C) Limb buds first analyzed by confocal microscopy (panels A and C) were remounted and imaged by light-sheet microscopy. Left panel: 3D volume rendering of a forelimb bud to detect both Msx1 (red channel) and Sox9 (green channel). Right panel: 3D volume rendering of a forelimb bud to detect Gdf5 (red) and Col2a1 (green). Nuclei are counterstained by DAPI (blue channel). Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] and S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2] are available online for panel C. Scale bars: 500 μm.\nPause point: If required, store the mounted samples at 4°C in the dark for short-term storage (1–3 weeks) and at −20°C for long-term storage.",
    "Note: Using a spinning disk confocal microscope with a 10× objective (Visitron Spinning Disk Confocal) works well for acquiring Z-stacks of mouse limb buds up to E13.5 (dorsal to ventral direction) with appropriate resolution. For 2-dimensional maximum projection imaging, a step size of 5 μm is sufficient. Such 5 μm Z-stacks are adequate to reconstruct 3D images. However, stack sizes between 0.7-1 μm Z-spacing are recommended for high-resolution analysis with close to single-cell resolution. Representative 2-dimensional maximum projection results are shown in Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D, 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, and 2B.\nAgarose embedding and refractive index matching for light sheet imaging\nTiming: ∼24 h\nPrepare Fructose-Glycerol-Cleared samples (step 25) for light sheet microscopy as follows.\nPrepare 1% or 2% agarose by dissolving low-melting-point agarose in 10 mM Tris pH 7.4.\nLet it cool to 40°C on a heat block with a magnetic stirrer.\nLet the melted agarose stand in a water bath at 40°C until the microbubbles disappear from the agarose (check by eye).\nGently pour the agarose into a Tissue-Tek cryomold and let it cool.\nTransfer a limb bud sample using a plastic pipette.\nOrient the sample using a pipet tip.\nNote: Low-melting-point agarose takes approximately 5 min to solidify, which leaves sufficient time to orient the sample with a pipet tip.\nTrim the excess agarose using a razor blade once it solidifies.\nTransfer the small cube-shaped sample block to a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nNote: The refractive index of the Fructose-Glycerol-Clearing solution is 1.47.\nAdjust the refractive index of the Fructose-Glycerol-Clearing solution to 1.45 by adding 10 mM Tris (pH 7.4).\nAdd 1 mL of the Fructose-Glycerol-Clearing solution (refractive index 1.45) to the agarose-embedded sample tube.\nGently shake on a rocking platform (20 oscillations/min) for 24 h at room temperature (24°C) in the dark.",
    "Critical: Measure the refractive index using a refractometer always before use. 24 h are sufficient to match the refractive index. If necessary, continue for an additional 24–48 h at 4°C in the dark (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.13]).\nNote: We use a Zeiss Lightsheet 7 microscope with the ZEN black 3.1 LS (version 9.3.10.393) software and lasers at a fixed wavelength of 561 nm and 638 nm. Dual side illumination is performed using the illumination air lenses LSFM foc 5×/0.1 and adjusted for a refractive index of 1.45. Fluorescence is detected using an EC Plan-Neofluar 5×/0.16 air detection objective, with the correction collar adjusted to the refractive index. Agarose-embedded samples are adhered to a metal plunger and mounted onto the sample holder. Then, the samples are immersed into a 5× clearing chamber filled with 30–40 mL of the refractive index-matched Fructose-Glycerol-Clearing solution (step 33). Manual alignment of the light sheet is performed using the 561 nm laser and adjusting the collars to the refractive index. The Z-stacks are acquired using the optimal step size of 3.77 μm to achieve the recommended Nyquist sampling. All acquired images are aligned and fused with Fiji and custom scripts using the BigStitcher plugin. The results are then converted to an IMARIS file that allows the reconstruction of the 3D volumes. Representative light sheet microscopy results are shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and the Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] and S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2].\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S1.

Nuclei are stained with DAPI (blue).\nWhole-mount immunofluorescence analysis\nTiming: ∼48 h\nA conventional immunohistochemistry protocol without antigen retrieval is used following fixation and photochemical bleaching (OMAR steps 2–10).\nCritical: Store the 4% PFA fixed embryos in PBS before dehydration for immunofluorescence.\nAs tissue autofluorescence issues often hamper whole-mount immunofluorescence analysis. We tested the OMAR protocol with several antibodies using mouse limb buds. While background fluorescence specific to antibodies is observed in some cases, high-quality results without the need for computational autofluorescence masking or subtraction are obtained with different antibodies (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). We recommend that the suitability of OMAR is established in a test experiment for all antibodies of interest (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section, problem 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.15]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3016-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

All limb buds shown are analyzed by confocal microscopy without digital post-processing apart from standard brightness and contrast adjustments. Scale bar: 500 μm.\nNote: Per 2 mL tube, 4–6 limb buds can be pooled. Steps 34–39 are carried out on a rocking platform (20 oscillations/min):\nPermeabilize photochemically bleached samples 3 times for 10 min in 1 mL 0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS (at room temperature, 24°C).\nRemove 0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS. Pre-block the samples in 1 mL Blocking solution for at least 45 min (at room temperature, 24°C).",
    "Remove the Blocking solution. Incubate the samples with the primary antibody diluted in the Blocking solution for 16–20 h at 4°C.\nRemove the primary antibody solution. Wash the samples with 1 mL 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (pH 7.4) 6 times 30 min at room temperature (24°C).\nNote: The blocking solution stock is made without donkey serum and stored at 4°C for 6 months. Fresh donkey serum is added to an aliquot just before use.\nNote: The optimal primary antibody dilution has to be determined for each antibody by a titration test. In general, primary antibody dilutions in the range of 1:50-1:200 are recommended as starting points.\nIf necessary, the primary antibody incubation can be extended for 48–72 h.\nCritical: Centrifuge the diluted primary antibody at 1500 g in a tabletop microfuge for 10 min and immediately transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube to remove any precipitates.\nTransfer the samples to a new microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd the secondary antibody in 0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS, 1% BSA, and 10% serum that contains DAPI (1:1000 dilution).\nIncubate for 16–20 h at 4°C in the dark.\nNote: In general, secondary antibody dilutions in the range of 1:200-1:2000 are recommended.\nRemove the secondary antibody solution.\nWash the samples with 1 mL 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (pH 7.4) for 3 h at room temperature (24°C).\nChange the solution minimally 6 times, i.e., every 30 min.\nNote: The samples are now ready for optical clearing (continuing from step 25 of the core protocol).
