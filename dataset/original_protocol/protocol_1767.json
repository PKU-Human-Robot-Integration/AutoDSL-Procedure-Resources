    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nInjection with peptidoglycan\nTiming: 3–4 days\nRepeated injections with PGN are used to engage robust innate immune response.\nPrepare PGN solution.\nPrepare enough volume of a solution containing 50 μg of Nucleotide-binding Oligomerization Domain-containing protein (NOD)1 agonist PGN /mL of sterile saline. For NOD2 agonist PGNs, prepare a solution at 500 μg/mL of sterile saline. Always prepare fresh solutions on the day of injection and do not save remaining volume for the next day.\nInject mice with PGN.\nUse the intraperitoneal route to deliver 200 μL of NOD1 agonist PGN (10 μg/mouse/day) for 3 consecutive days to half of the cohort. If using NOD2 agonist PGNs, inject 200 μL (i.e., 100 μg/mouse/day) for 3 consecutive days to half of the cohort. The time of the injection must be consistent over the days.\nInject the other half of the cohort with sterile saline.\nNote: This protocol was optimized using FK565, a synthetic DAP-containing PGN and potent NOD1 agonist. MDP, the minimal bioactive PGN motif that activates NOD2, was used to optimize the methods for NOD2 agonist PGNs. This protocol is suitable for testing NOD receptor antagonists and postbiotics activating pathways related to innate immune receptors other than NODs. Dose and timing of administration may require some optimization for different postbiotics.\nInjection with lipopolysaccharide\nTiming: 6 h\nThis step promotes the synergy between different postbiotics as PGN-treated mice receive one single dose of LPS.\nPrepare LPS solution.\nPrepare enough volume of a solution containing 0.04 mg of E. coli LPS/mL of sterile saline. Always prepare fresh solutions on the day of injection and do not save remaining volumes.\nFast mice for 6 h and inject them with LPS (injections and fasting are concomitant).",
    "At 8:00 AM, place all mice in clean cages, with fresh bedding and enrichment, and bring cages from housing to procedure room. Make sure lights are on in this new room to respect light/dark cycle, and that temperature matches that of the housing room. The procedure room must be a quiet place without circulation to people.\nNote: Removing chow from the feeder – alone – is not sufficient to grant appropriate fasting conditions. When fasting mice, transfer them to clean cages with fresh bedding and without access to food. Avoid moving cages to a different room close to starting endpoint assessment. This can stress the animals and elevate fasting blood glucose.\nWeigh all the mice and record body weights.\nInject half of the mice pre-treated with NOD1 agonist PGN and half of the mice pre-treated with saline with 10 μL/g of body weight using LPS solution at 0.04 mg/mL (to yield a final dose of 0.4 mg/kg). If using a NOD2 agonist, inject mice with 5 μL/g of body weight using LPS solution at 0.04 mg/mL (to yield a final dose of 0.2 mg/kg). Inject the other half of the cohort with sterile saline.\nWait 6 h and then proceed to endpoint assessment starting at 2:00 PM.\nEndpoint assessment – glucose tolerance test\nTiming: 2.5–3 h\nThe impact of the synergy LPS-PGN on glucose tolerance is assessed by means of a GTT.\nMeasure fasting blood glucose.\nUse a razor blade to nick the mouse’s tail (approximately 1 cm from the tip).\nGently milk the tail from bottom to top until a big drop is formed.\nWipe out the first drop with gauze.\nRepeat the procedure and then acquire blood glucose using a glucometer and glucose strips.\nRecord values.\nAdminister glucose load.",
    "Inject mice intraperitoneally with 10 μL/g of body weight using a D-glucose solution at 0.2 g/mL of sterile saline (to yield a final dose of 2 g/kg).\nNote: For oral GTT, gavage mice with 10 μL/g of body weight using a D-glucose solution at 0.4 g/mL of sterile saline (to yield a final dose of 4 g/kg). Warm solution to 40°C and place it under constant agitation to ease glucose solubilization.\nMonitor blood glucose after glucose load.\nApply the same procedure described in step 5 to assess blood glucose 20, 30, 40, 60, 90 and 120 min after glucose load. Record values."
