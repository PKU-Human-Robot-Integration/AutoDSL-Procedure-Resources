    "1. SPPS: CK(TMR)TATG (fTAT) Synthesis\nNote: dfTAT is produced in two steps: synthesis of the monomer fTAT by solid phase peptide synthesis followed by disulfide bond dimerization to form dfTAT.\nSwell 500 mg of rink amide MBHA resin in dimethylformamide (DMF) in a standard 50 ml SPPS vessel for 1 hr.\nPerform Fmoc deprotection by incubating the Fmoc protected resin in a 20% piperidine solution (20% piperidine in DMF, 10 ml (0.30 mmol). Carry out deprotection steps twice (1 x 5 min and 1 x 15 min) with a washing step using DMF (the washing step includes rinsing the resin multiple times with a total volume of approximately 150 ml of DMF and removing the solvent by vacuum filtration) in between reactions.\nSynthesize CK(TMR)RKKRRQRRRG (fTAT) on the rink amide MBHA resin. Use the following Fmoc protected amino acids: Fmoc-Lys(Mtt)-OH (only on N-terminus), Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH, Fmoc-Gly-OH, Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH, Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-OH, and Fmoc-Cys(Trt)-OH. Carry out the reaction using N2 (20 PSI) to agitate the reaction. Perform all reactions at RT.\n\t\nCarry out each amino acid coupling reaction for 4 hr. For each coupling, use the Fmoc protected amino acid (1.2 mmol), N,N,N ′ ,N ′ -Tetramethyl- O- (1 H -benzotriazol-1-yl)uronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) (0.44 g, 1.1 mmol), and diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) (0.51 ml, 3.0 mmol) dissolved in DMF. Following the 4 hr coupling, wash the resin with DMF and perform the Fmoc deprotection step as described in step 1.2.\nRepeat until the linear peptide chain of fTAT (Linear peptide chain: CKRKKRRQRRRG no TMR) was synthesized.\nThen wash resin thoroughly using first DMF and following that with dichloromethane (DCM). Rinse the resin multiple times with a total volume of approximately 150 ml of DMF or DCM and remove the solvent by vacuum filtration.\nUse MALDI-TOF to confirm that the peptide obtained has the correct molecular weight.",
    "Make a matrix mix by adding 1 mg of matrix to a solution composed of 50 µl of 0.01% TFA in water solution and 50 µl of acetonitrile.\nTo confirm linear peptide chain mass, use α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. Run an analytical HPLC of the crude peptide and collect 50 µl from the top of the pure peak.\nTo prepare the sample to plate on the MALDI plate: Add 8 µl of the peptide to 2 µl of the matrix solution and place on the MALDI plate to air dry or on a 37 °C heat plate.\n\t\t\tNote: Arginine is known to be an amino acid difficult to couple in SPPS. Successful coupling is established by performing a Kaiser test14 (e.g., ninhydrin test). This test allows for the detection of free amines that might remain uncoupled on the resin. In case a blue color is detected (indicative of the presence of free amines), coupling steps are repeated.\nFor CK(-NH-TMR)TATG (fTAT), cleave the Mtt protecting group at the -amino group of Lys on CK(-NH-Mtt)TATG with a solution composed of 1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and 2% triisopropylsilane (TIS) in DCM.\n\t\nAs the removal of MTT protecting group would result in the appearance of a yellow color, incubate the resin with 20 ml of the above solution for 5 min, repeat this until no yellow color is observed. Wash the resin with DCM and DMF in between. Additionally since TIS is a scavenger that would scavenge the MTT, once no yellow color appears in the solution in the presence of MTT.\nAdd an additional solution with 1% TFA in DCM (no TIS) to the resin to insure no more MTT is removed and the solution remains clear.",
    "Dissolve the three components: Carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TMR), HBTU, and DIEA (4, 3.9 and 10 equivalence in respect to the amount of resin (in mg)) in DMF and add this mixture to the resin and carry out the reaction O/N using dry N2 to provide agitation.\nFollowing Fmoc-deprotection and amino acid conjugation, wash the resin with DCM and allow it to dry. For complete cleavage of the peptide from the resin, add a solution containing 92.5% TFA, 2.5% H2O, 2.5%, TIS, and 2.5% ethanedithiol (EDT) (total volume = 4 ml) to the peptidyl-resin for 3 hr at RT to achieve global deprotection and cleavage from the resin.\n\t\nPrecipitate the crude peptide products using cold anhydrous ethyl ether (Et2O) by draining the solution from step 1.6 into 40 ml of Et2O, spin this down at 4 °C and 4,000 x g for 20 - 25 min. Repeat this step to allow washing of the precipitate with cold anhydrous Et2O.\nResuspend the precipitates in water (5 ml or until precipitate is completely dissolved) and lyophilize. Then resuspend the products obtained in 0.1% aqueous TFA/acetonitrile.\nPerform HPLC analysis with an analytical C18 column (5 µm, 4 x 150 mm) to analyze each peptide. Use a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and detection at 214 nm and 550 nm.\nPerform semi-preparative HPLC on a C18 10 x 250 mm column for peptide purification. Use a flow rate of 4 ml/min, and detection at 214 nm and 550 nm. For all runs, use linear gradients of 0.1% aqueous TFA (solvent A) and 90% acetonitrile, 9.9% water, and 0.1% TFA (solvent B).\nConfirm the correct identity of the peptides by MALDI-TOF according to manufacturer’s protocol: fTAT, expected mass: 2,041.17, observed mass: 2040.66. DEAC-K9, expected mass: 1,412.97, observed mass: 1,415.59. Use an α- cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix for the MALDI-TOF.",
    "2. Oxidation Reaction: dfTAT Generation\nAerate phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4 for 1 hr (at least 5 ml for the reaction below).\nDissolve fTAT (0.3 mg, 1.5 x 10-4 mmol) in aerated PBS pH 7.4 (5 ml). Make sure that the pH is between 7.0 - 7.5 after the addition of the peptide. If not add sodium hydroxide (1 M, in small increments 1 - 5 µl) to bring the pH back up to 7.4.\nNote: Oxygen dissolved in PBS acts to oxidize the thiol groups on fTAT and form a disulfide bond.\nNutate the reaction O/N to allow it to react until completion (100% yield based on HPLC analysis). Purify the product using reverse-phase HPLC and analyze by mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) as in step 1.9. Expected mass: 4,080.34, observed mass: 4,084.21.\nLyophilize pure dfTAT (0.71 x10-4 mmol) and resuspend in 200 µl water (concentration pure dfTAT = 356.3 µM).\n3. Measuring dfTAT Concentration\nResuspend an aliquot of the purified dfTAT (typically 1 µl depending on the amount of peptide purified) in a 149 µl of 50 mM TCEP solution.\nNote: In this step dfTAT is reduced to its monomer counterpart fTAT to eliminate the absorbance quenching that occurs due to the close proximity of the TMR fluorophore in dfTAT (the extinction coefficient ε of TMR in dfTAT is reduced in comparison to the ε of TMR in reduced fTAT).\nAllow the sample to react for approximately 20 min (analytical HPLC can be used to confirm formation of fTAT).\nAdd all the solution to the quartz cuvette and measure the absorbance at 556 nm.\nUsing Beer’s Law ( A= εcl : ε= 91,500 M-1 cm-1) to calculate the concentration of fTAT, determine the concentration of dfTAT, and divide [fTAT] by two.\n4. Cellular Delivery Experiments",
    "Seed the cells (HeLa, HDF, etc.) in a dish at a confluency of 80 - 90% (e.g., 8-well or 24-well dish). Grow cells in an appropriate medium (e.g., DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and Pen/Strep) until 80 - 90% confluency in a 37 °C humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.\nWash the cells three times (3X) with PBS (by adding 200 µl of PBS and then removing it three times).\nMake a 5 µM working concentration of dfTAT by diluting a stock of dfTAT (in water) in nrL-15 media (for an 8 well dish the total volume should be 200 µl). A concentration of 5 µM dfTAT leads to efficient delivery (high level of cytosolic delivery in more than 90% of cells present in a dish) in most cell types tested to date (Figure 3). However, lower or higher concentrations might be more adequate for cell types with a high or low propensity for penetration.\n\tNOTE ABOUT MEDIA: nrL-15 is used for the delivery of dfTAT since it does not contain cysteine which could reduce the disulfide bond in dfTAT. However, our data indicate that both regular L-15 (with cysteine) and DMEM can be used as the delivery media. L-15 contains the reducing amino acid cysteine but cysteine presumably oxidizes in the media to form cystine (DMEM is formulated with cystine). dfTAT therefore remains intact in these media and delivery works at the same efficiency as that obtained with nrL15.\nIncubate cells with dfTAT (5 µM) with or without cargo (e.g., EGFP (10 µM)) and keep at 37 °C for 1 hr (incubation time can be reduced but dfTAT typically requires approximately 30 to 45 min to induce endosomal leakage).",
    "Wash cells with heparin (1 mg/ml) in L-15 (3 washes are recommended) to remove dfTAT bound to the plasma membrane of cells.\nIncubate cells with cell-impermeable nuclear stain, e.g., Sytox Blue, Sytox Green (2 µM in nrL-15), to determine whether the plasma membrane of cells is compromised (dead cells will be stained while live cells will not) according to manufacturer’s protocol.\nImage cells using a fluorescence microscope (100X oil immersion or 20X objective). Image dfTAT using a RFP filter (Ex = 560 ± 20 nm/Em = 630 ± 35 nm).\n\tNote: Successful delivery leads to a diffuse fluorescence of dfTAT throughout the cell (assessing the delivery of protein or peptide of interest will depend on application). Staining of nucleoli by fTAT (the reduced product of dfTAT upon cytosolic entry) can be used as an indication that the fluorescence detected is intracellular. fTAT will degrade within few hours. At this point, the fluorescence of the degradation fragments will appear as punctate. This should not be confused for the punctate distribution that is also seen if dfTAT remains unsuccessfully trapped inside endosomes (this can happen if dfTAT is present at too low of a concentration).\n5. Controling Concentration of MOI Delivered\nIdentify the “optimal delivery” concentration required to achieve efficient cytosolic release of dfTAT in the cell type used. Perform fluorescence microscopy on cells incubated with increasing concentrations of dfTAT. The optimal dfTAT concentration is defined as the minimal concentration that leads to clear cytosolic “diffuse” TMR fluorescence in approximately 100% of cells in a culture.\nVary the concentration of MOI used in co-incubation protocol while keeping the concentration of dfTAT constant (e.g., using dfTAT’s optimal delivery concentration). Changing the incubation time to less than 1 hr could also be an option to vary the amount of MOI delivered.",
