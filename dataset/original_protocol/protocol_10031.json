    "All animal protocols were approved by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Animal Care and Use Committee and performed in accordance with the guidelines described in the Animal Care and Welfare Act (7 USC 2142 § 13).\n1. Isolated Perfused Heart System and Perfusate\nNOTE: This preparation is very similar to previous publications23.\nMake 4 liters of modified Krebs-Henseleit perfusate composed of (in mmol/L) 137.0 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 0.5 MgCl2, 1.0 Na2HPO4, 10.0 glucose, 1.0 lactate, and 10.0 HEPES.\npH the perfusate to 7.4 at 37 °C with NaOH and HCl.\nFilter the perfusate through a 1 µm pore membrane.\nRinse all tubes and chambers of the perfused heart system by running and draining purified water through the system.\nTransfer the perfusate into the tank and oxygenate with 100% O2 with the bubbler while maintaining the temperature at 37 °C using a heated circulating water bath.\nAdd 2 of 12 µm pore membrane filters and prime the system with the perfusate while recirculating in the Langendorff mode.\nAttach a tubing clamp on the tube right above the aortic cannula and adjust the screw so that the aortic flow drops to about 10 mL/min.\n2. Rabbit Heart Excision and Perfusion\nHeart excision\n\t\nAnesthetize male New Zealand white rabbits (about 3 kg) via a 1.5 mL intramuscular injection of ketamine/acepromazine mixture (10:1).\nApproximately 10–15 minutes later, administer 3% isoflurane via inhalation for a complete anesthetic effect.\nConfirm proper depth of anesthesia by toe pinching and then place a line in the marginal ear vein for administration of subsequent drugs.\nInject 1,500 units (or 1.5 mL of 1,000 units/mL) of Heparin and let circulate for 3 minutes.\nDouble check proper depth of anesthesia and then euthanize with 6 mEq (or 3 mL of 2 mEq/mL) of KCl.",
    "Rapidly open the chest, locate the heart’s apex and the aorta. Remove the heart by cutting the aorta as far from the heart as possible and cutting the pulmonary veins as close to the lungs as possible.\n\t\t​NOTE: Removal of lungs at this early stage is different than previous publication23 but has not impact on preparation.\nPlace the heart in a small beaker of perfusate (same perfusate as step 1.3) sitting in a bucket of ice for transportation from surgery to perfusion.\nHeart cannulation\n\t\nCannulate and tie the aorta securely, making sure not to include any bubbles in the aortic line.\nInitiate flow at 70 mmHg perfusion pressure by removing the tubing clamp on the aortic line and maintain this pressure during the remainder of the surgery and vessel cannulation.\nSeparate the pulmonary artery from the aorta and other vessels and ligate the vena cavae and pulmonary veins. Remove the fat and connective tissue still present.\nCannulate the pulmonary artery to provide a measure of coronary sinus flow rate and oxygen tension.\nDiscard initial flow out of the heart (for about 10 minutes) during the preparation to eliminate blood and surgical debris. After this period, recirculate the perfusate.\n3. Side-Firing Fiber Optic Placement\nConnect the fiber optic catheter to a high-power fiber-coupled LED white light source to help visualization as well as provide the light for spectroscopy once in the heart.\nCut a small appendage of the left atrium, insert the catheter into the left ventricle via the mitral valve, then rotate it to achieve an illuminated left ventricle free wall.\nPosition the pickup fiber optic directly opposite the region of maximum illumination of the left ventricle at about 1 cm from the heart.\nConnect the other end of the pickup fiber to a rapid scanning spectrometer.\n4. Optical Spectroscopy",
    "Turn off the lights in the experimental area to obtain complete darkness.\nStart the custom program, incorporating spectrometer drivers to perform data acquisition and real-time analysis of the transmitted light.\n\t​NOTE: An executable version of the consolidated version of the spectral acquisition and analysis program is provided as a Supplemental Coding File. Source code is available by request to the authors.\nNavigate through all prompts, selecting options for perfused heart spectroscopy acquisition mode. On the next page, indicate whether auxiliary data collection is occurring. Finally, enter acquisition parameters, including location of both chromophores reference spectra and data to be saved.\nEnter a bandwidth of 490–630 nm.\nEnter a sampling rate of 2 Hz (i.e. 2 samples/sec).\nCollect a dark current, or zero light, spectrum to correct for background signal levels by turning the light source off.\nClick to select the chromophore references desired to be used in the fitting routine.\nIn the Acquire Data page, adjust the position of both the catheter and the pickup fiber to maximize the transmitted light displayed on the software with specific attention to the signal amplitude in the 500 nm region, where the oxygenated myoglobin absorbances should be observed.\nMake sure the transmitted light is not saturating the detector in the 600 nm region.\nEnsure no external light sources contribute to the collected spectrum by turning off catheter illumination and confirming no light is now detected.\nInitiate the data collection by clicking on the Save Spectra button.\nClick on Set as Control to view the difference absorbance spectrum from future spectra to the current “control” spectrum.\nPerform any physiological perturbation as desired.\n\t\nProtocol 1: Effect of Cyanide on Cardiac Performance and Chromophore Absorption\n\t\t\nStop recirculating fluid from the heart perfusion.",
    "Using a syringe pump, inject cyanide (2.5 to 75 mM at pH 7) at different rates into perfusate just before the aortic cannula to achieve desired concentrations of cyanide (0.025 to 1 mM, calculated from aortic flow rate) in the flowing perfusate into the heart while monitoring cardiac function and optical properties.\nStop the cyanide syringe pump when the effects on coronary flow and heart rate along with the optical transmission through the heart wall are at steady state.\nProtocol 2: Ischemia/Hypoxia\n\t\t\nStop cyanide infusion.\nAfter 5 minutes switch the bubbling gas from 100% oxygen to 100% nitrogen to remove oxygen from the system.\nAfter about 10 minutes, stop the flow to simulate a total ischemic/hypoxic condition.\n5. Spectral data analysis\nRun the program in the perfused heart analysis mode.\nSelect appropriate spectrometer.\nEnter the data file path and reference spectra file and select catheter light source, which loads the pre-saved spectrum of the catheter light source.\nSelect Read Bin Data.  \nSelect Set Min and Max Wavelength.\nEnter the bandwidth for the data analysis as 490–630 nm.\nSelect Return to Main Menu.\nSelect Read References.\nConfirm the reference spectra to use in the analysis.\nSelect Return to Main Menu.\nSelect Time Points in the main menu.\nSelect a T0 time point as control and set the range to 100 points.\nSelect a T1 time point as the experimental period at a range of 100 points.\nObserve the raw difference spectrum in the Averaged Abs. Spectrum tab.\nSelect Calculate Fit Coefficients and then click on the Fit Coefficients tab to observe the time course of the reference spectra fit.\nReturn to the Main Menu and select Calculate Difference Abs.",
    "Select T0 and ΔT1 at all positions. Observe the fitted spectrum in the Difference Spectrum window and fitting elements in the Reference Weight window.\nRepeat this procedure to compare other time points in the experiment.\nReturn to the Main Menu.\nSave data and analysis in a spreadsheet report by typing in a desired name and selecting Save Data for further analysis with other programs.\n\tNOTE: if no name is typed, the report is saved with the same name as the input file. The report is saved in a folder named Excel Analysis Files, located in the same folder as the original input file."
