    "1. Construction of the Magnetic Devices\nNOTE: The devices used for cell seeding vary depending on the application (Figure 1). To form aggregates, the number of cells is limited to 2.5×105/aggregate, so the magnetic tips must be very thin (750 µm in diameter). To seed the 1.8 cm2/7 mm-thick scaffolds, the magnets must be larger (3 mm in diameter) and will ensure cell migration through the pores of the scaffold.\nConstruction of a device with micro-magnets for aggregate formation (Figure 1A)\n\t\nMake micro-holes with a 0.8-mm drill through aluminum plates (3 cm in diameter and 6 mm thick).\nInsert a magnetic tip (750 µm in diameter) into each hole of the plate.\nPlace this disk over a permanent neodymium magnet, which ensures magnetization to saturation.\nConstruction of a device for scaffold seeding (Figure 1B)\n\t\nCut hard polystyrene into 2.4 cm2 squares.\nInsert 9 small magnets (3 mm in diameter, 6 mm long) at an equal distance over a surface area of 1.6 cm2.\nPlace this device over a permanent neodymium magnet.\n2. Stem Cell Labeling\nNOTE: Stem cells were labeled with 0.1 mM magnetic nanoparticles for 30 min (2.6 ± 0.2 pg iron/cell) to form aggregates, while they were labeled with 0.2 mM magnetic nanoparticles for 30 min (5 ± 0.4 pg iron/cell) to seed scaffolds. These nanoparticle concentrations and incubation times have been used previously and published for MSC and other cells18,19, and it has been determined that nanoparticles impacted neither cell viability nor MSC differentiation capacity. The iron mass incorporated by the stem cells was measured via single-cell magnetophoresis19,20.\nCulture human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in complete mesenchymal stem cell growth medium (MSCGM) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until near to confluence (~90%).",
    "Prepare the magnetic labeling solution by mixing 0.1 or 0.2 mM maghemite citrate-coated iron oxide (γFe2O3; core: 8 nm diameter) in serum-free McCoy's 5A medium modified at Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RMPI) without glutamine and containing 5 mM sodium citrate.\nDiscard the medium, rinse the cells with serum-free RPMI medium without glutamine, and add 10 mL of iron oxide nanoparticle solution per 150-cm2 culture flask, the minimum volume required to cover all the cells.\nIncubate for 30 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and then discard the nanoparticle solution. Rinse for 5 min with serum-free RPMI medium without glutamine to internalize the nanoparticles still attached to the plasma membrane.\nDiscard the RPMI medium and add 25 mL of complete MSCGM medium per flask. Incubate overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n3. Magnetic Cell Seeding\nFreshly prepare the chondrogenic medium using Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) high glucose with L-glutamine by adding 50 µM L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate, 0.1 µM dexamethasone, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.35 mM L-proline, 1% universal culture supplement containing insulin, human transferrin and selenous acid (ITS-Premix), and 10 ng/mL transforming growth factor-beta 3 (TGF-β3).\nDetach the magnetic cells using 8 mL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA per 150-cm2 culture flask and centrifuge the dissociated cells at 260 × g for 5 min. Aspirate the medium and count the re-suspended cells.\nPlace a glass-bottomed cell culture Petri dish (35 mm) on top of both magnetic devices.",
    "To magnetically form aggregates, add 3 mL of chondrogenic medium to the Petri dish and gently deposit the smallest volume possible (no more than 8 µL) containing 2.5×105 labeled cells per aggregate (up to 16 aggregates can be deposited). Leave the Petri dish for 20-30 min without moving it, allowing it to form spheroids, and then place the complete device, including the Petri dish containing the 16 aggregates, into the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nForm control aggregates following the same protocol and replace the complete medium with chondrogenic medium without TGF-β3.\n\t\nTo generate the 3D aggregate construct, place 2 aggregates in contact on day 8 to form 8 doublets and initiate the fusion. On day 11, merge 2 doublets to form 4 quadruplets. Finally, fuse the 4 quadruplets on day 15 to obtain the final structure.\nAt the same time, form aggregates by centrifuging 2.5×105 labeled stem cells at 260 × g for 5 min in 15-mL tubes with 1.5 mL of chondrogenic medium with or without TGF-β3 (for sample and control, respectively).\nTo magnetically seed scaffolds, place each dried scaffold into a Petri dish. Use polysaccharide porous scaffolds made of pullulan/dextran21. For each scaffold, dilute 2×106 labeled stem cells in 350 µL of chondrogenic medium without TGF-β3 and carefully pipette the cells onto the scaffold.\n\t\nIncubate for 5 min at 37 °C to allow for full cell penetration within the scaffold and then gently add 3 mL of chondrogenic medium with or without TGF-β3 (for sample or control, respectively) to the Petri dish.\nIncubate the cellularized scaffold on its magnetic device at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 4 days to allow for cell migration through the scaffold pores and confinement.",
    "At the same time, seed scaffolds with 2×106 labeled stem cells following the same method and incubate without the magnet to obtain uniformly seeded scaffolds as positive controls.\n4. Differentiation into Chondrocytes\nNOTE: After 4 days of incubation, remove the magnets and continue the chondrogenic maturation either in a Petri dish (static conditions) or in a bioreactor (dynamic conditions). Negative control samples are matured in static conditions with chondrogenic medium without TGF-β3.\nIn static conditions, keep the cellularized scaffolds or aggregates in the same Petri dish. Change the chondrogenic medium twice a week for 21 days.\nIn dynamic conditions, prepare the bioreactor.\n\t\nCut silicone tubing at the appropriate length according to the manufacturer's protocol.\nAutoclave all materials: 500-mL culture chamber, tubing, 2-way rotators, and cages.\nPlace the bioreactor parts into a sterile microbiological safety station. Connect the tubing to the 2-way rotators and to the culture chamber following the manufacturer's instructions.\nCarefully transfer the cellularized scaffolds into sterilized cages using a sterile spatula. Place 2 scaffolds per cage. When the cages are ready, insert them into the needles of the lid to keep them from moving during further rotation. Fill the culture chamber with chondrogenic medium and close it with the lid containing the cages.\nTurn on the peristaltic pump to fill the tubing with chondrogenic medium and to eliminate air bubbles.\nPlace and secure the filled chamber into the motor of the bioreactor and turn on the computer, which controls the rotations both of the arm and of the chamber.\nApply a rotation speed of 5 rotations per min (rpm) on both the arm and the chamber. Adjust the peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 10 rpm for continuous feeding of the cellularized scaffolds.\n5. RNA Extraction and Gene Expression Analysis",
    "NOTE: Prior to RNA extraction, digest the scaffolds with an enzymatic solution.\nPrepare 1 mL of enzymatic solution by adding 100 µL of pullulanase (40 U/mL) and 50 µL of dextranase (60 mg/mL) to 850 mL of serum-free DMEM medium.\nRinse the scaffolds twice with serum-free DMEM medium, discard the medium, and add 800 µL of the enzymatic solution per scaffold. Incubate for 15-30 min at 37 °C under gentle agitation.\nWhen the scaffold is completely dissolved, transfer the solution containing the cells to a 1.5-mL tube, centrifuge at 300 × g for 10 min, carefully aspirate the medium, rinse twice with sterile 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), centrifuge at 300 × g for 10 min, and re-suspend the cells in the RNA isolation solution.\nTo extract the RNA from the aggregates, place the spheroids in the RNA isolation solution and completely crush them using a homogenizer before performing RNA extraction.\nIsolate the RNA using a kit for total RNA extraction according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nSynthesize complementary DNA from 400 ng of total RNA using reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's instructions, using 250-ng random primers, 1 µL of dNTP mix (10 mM each), and 40 U/mL RNase inhibitor; the final volume of reaction is 20 µL. At the end of the reaction, add 80 µL of distilled water to obtain a final volume of 100 µL.",
    "For quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), use a PCR mix containing a fluorescent reagent to quantify the relative expression of the genes of interest, such as aggrecan (AGC) and collagen II (Col II), with 10× diluted cDNA. Normalize the levels of gene expression with the reference gene Ribosomal Protein, Large, P0 (RPLP0). Perform the calculations with the 2-ΔΔCT formula, where ΔΔCT = ΔCT of differentiated condition - mean ΔCT of control condition, and each ΔCT represents the CT of the gene of interest - the CT of the reference gene (RPLP0).\nDetermine statistical measurements as the mean values ± the standard error of the mean (SEM). Perform the analysis with n ≥ 2 independent experiments. Use Student's t-test to analyze the statistical differences between centrifuged pellets and magnetic fusions (* p < 0.05). Determine the significance with a Kruskal-Wallis test (one-way ANOVA nonparametric) to analyze statistical differences between differentiated scaffolds and with the control scaffold (* p < 0.05).\n6. Histological Analysis\nRinse the cellularized scaffolds or aggregates with sterile 1× PBS, fix them in 10% formalin solution for 1 h at room temperature, and rinse with 1× PBS.\nRemove the PBS, embed the samples in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT), and freeze them in an isopentane bath immersed in liquid nitrogen. Store the sample at -20 °C. Cut the samples with a cryostat to obtain 8-µm cryosections for the aggregates or 12-µm for the cellularized scaffolds.\nStain the cryosections with 0.5% toluidine blue solution for 2 min, rinse in tap water, dehydrate with 100% ethanol, clarify using toluene, and mount the slides with a mounting medium for light microscopy.\nSubscription Required.
