    "Chicken egg manipulation and incubationPrior to incubation, fertilized specific pathogen free (SPF) (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington) (Note 1) or White Leghorn chicken eggs (Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI) are stored at room temperature up to 5 days without significant decrease in viability (80-85% viability) or defects in development (Note 2). Before incubating the eggs, check the conditions of the incubator (Note 3). For electroporations in the eye, we incubate the eggs approximately 35 h for Stages 8-9 (seven somites, the anterior neural folds closes to form the neural tube), 38 h for Stage 10 (ten somites, optic vesicles not constricted at bases), 48 h for Stage 12 (sixteen somites, optic vesicle and optic stalk established), 72 h for Stage 14 (optic vesicle evaginated and lens-placode present) or 4.5 days for Stage 22 [eye pigmented, retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and neuroepithelium well established] (Note 4). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150621/20150621014516_6892.jpgFigure 2. Stage 8-12 electrodes set up. Two isolated Pt/Ir electrodes with Polyimide Tubing (amber tube) having 1 mm of free tip (a) are bent as is indicated (b). Thereafter, the bent electrodes are inserted into a small plastic holder (made from a 20 µl pipet tip) with ~2 mm diameter (c1) and ~3 mm length (c2) keeping at the tip 1.5 mm in between (c). The electrodes are inserted into the holder made of Stainless Steel Tube (SST) and Resin Rod (RR) that has been modified with a press fit (d). Carefully, electrodes are permanently attached to the holder using epoxy. It is critical to keep the shape and 1.5 mm distance between the electrodes during this procedure (e). Finally, the Pt/Ir electrodes are connected to the cable that has been previously connected to the BNC adaptor of the electroporator.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150619/20150619001535_5472.jpgFigure 3. Stage 19-26 electrodes set up.",
    "One Gold plated thick electrode (anode +) is isolated with tygon microbore tubing (a). One Pt/Ir microelectrode (cathode -) is isolated using Polyimide Tubing (amber tube) having 1 mm of free tip (see Figure 2a) and inserted into a glass capillary tube and sealed with epoxy (b), that can be alternatively protected with a 1 ml pipet tip. The assembled electrodes are then connected to the cable that has been previously connected to the BNC adaptor of the electroporator (c).Electroporations at Stages 8-12Preparing the embryos for electroporationFertilized eggs are incubated horizontally on their sides so the embryo can be properly positioned for electroporation (Figure 4a). If electroporation is planned for more than one dozen, we strongly suggest to space out the incubation times for each dozen in order to have enough time to electroporate the next dozen at the same developmental stage. This is particularly critical for Stages 8 to 12. Once the embryos reach the desired Stage (approximately 38 h for Stage 10, see Chicken egg manipulation and incubation), proceed to open the eggs according with the instructions provided in the Video 1 (steps B1e-h below). It takes about 2 min to open each egg. The electroporation can be made immediately after opening the egg, however if you have enough experience opening the eggs you can open one dozen in about 25 min and then proceed with the electroporation immediately. Once the eggs reach the desired stage, place them in a carton and at room temperature for about 10 min. This incubation is necessary to facilitate the contraction of the inner shell membrane and promotes the separation from the outer shell membrane to generate the air sack.Keeping their horizontal position, place the eggs in a small incubator (e,g.",
    ", HOVA-BATOR) previously calibrated at 37-39 °C (99 to 103 °F) and relative humidity of 50-55%.With a bright light source, candle the egg and mark the area where the embryo is located, usually the embryo is located in the top part of the yolk (on the top of the horizontal section of the shell).Mark the air sack that is located between the outer and inner membranes of the egg.Pierce the shell at the top of the air sack using blunt ended forceps or a syringe with a large bore needle.Carefully, introduce a fine probe to move the air sack to the top part of the egg, this is possible by gently touching down to lower the inner shell membrane (Figure 4b-c) (Note 5).Using sharp curved scissors or blunt ended forceps, open a round window on the top of the embryo (around 2 cm of diameter) (Figure 4d) (Video 1 provides visual information of the steps B1e-h) and add 200 μl of HBSS. Close the window using transparent tape and return the egg to the incubator. Discard the embryos older than the desired stage. If the embryos have not reached the desired stage, they can be incubated for an additional time.Variations on the embryonic stage in which the electroporation is performed will produce inconsistency on the results and interpretation.Optionally, to enhance the contrast and visualize the embryo at Stages 8-12, inject 100 µl of Indian ink solution diluted in HBSS using a 1 ml syringe and a 25-26 gauge needle underneath the embryo.Repeat steps B1e-h for the rest of the eggs until the dozen is completed. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150619/20150619001556_0768.jpgFigure 4.

    "After localizing the air sack and the chick embryo, a fine probe is introduced to move the air sack to the top part of the egg. This is possible by gently touching and lowering the inner shell membrane (b, c). Finally, using sharp curved scissors or blunt ended forceps, open a round window on the top of the embryo (around 2 cm of diameter) (d).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Preparing the eggs for electroporation Embryo electroporationAdjust the nitrogen tank to 80 psi.Attach the beveled glass capillary needle to the stainless steel pipette holder of the microinjector (Figure 1c).Set the microinjector at 18-20 psi and perform a test loading HBSS using the “fill” button or the footswitch and release the solution pushing the button “empty” from the microinjector. Test the microinjection system using the Footswitch.Attach the blue dichroic filter to the optical path of the Tungsten Halogen Light Source. Configure the electroporator with the following settings: Mode, LV; voltage, 18 V; pulse length, 50 ms; number of pulses, 5; pulse interval, 950 ms; polarity, unipolar.Connect the Stage-8-12 electrodes (see the equipment section) to the electroporator.Using a 35mm tissue culture plate, containing 1 ml of HBSS, check the electroporation system placing the electrodes in the solution (Note 9). Using the footswitch from the microinjector, load the glass capillary needle with the experimental solution (Plasmid, RCAS constructs or MOs in the solutions section).Add 100 µl of HBSS to the embryo to decrease the resistance between the electrodes.For electroporations into the eye, inject 0.25 µl (20 microinjection pulses using a 20 µm of tip diameter glass capillary needle) of the solution into the anterior neural fold (anterior neuropore at Stage 8-9, Figure 5a) or into the optic vesicle (Stages 10-11, Figure 5b).",
    "Place the Stage 8-12 electrodes over the vitelline membrane (a clear membrane that is surrounding the egg yolk) in both sides of the embryo (parallel to the neural tube) (Figures 5a, b) and perform the electroporation using the electroporator footswitch.Carefully, remove the electrodes and add an additional 100 µl of HBSS.Seal the window with plastic tape and transfer the eggs to the incubator until they reach the desired stage. A representative image of an electroporated embryo at Stage 11 using a control MO (Figure 5c, d), and one collected 3 days after is shown in Figure 5e.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150619/20150619001631_4421.jpgFigure 5.

    "Check the electroporation system placing the electrodes (1 cm in between) in a 35 mm tissue culture plate containing 1 ml of HBSS (Note 9). Using the microinjector footswitch, load the glass capillary needle with the experimental solution (RCAS-DNA or morpholinos).For electroporations in the eye, inject 0.5 µl (40 microinjection pulses) into the eye cup at Stage 18-19 or 0.75 µl (60 microinjection pulses) into the eye at Stage 24-25 using a 20 µm diameter tip glass capillary needle. Add 200 µl of HBSS to the embryo to decrease the resistance between the electrodes.To perform the electroporation, the gold plated electrode connected to the anode (+) is placed close to the ventro-temporal section of the eye and the cathode (-) electrode is inserted perpendicular to the head of the embryo (Video 2 essentially describes steps C8-10).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2 .
