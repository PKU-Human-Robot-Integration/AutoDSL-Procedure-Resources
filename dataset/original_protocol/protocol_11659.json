    "The use of umbilical cord tissue in this study was approved by the Institutional Committee for Stem Cell Research (IC-SCR), the Institutional Ethics Committee, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (IEC-THSTI), the Institutional Ethics Committee of Civil Hospital, Gurugram, Haryana, and the Institutional Biosafety Committee, THSTI. Human cord tissue samples were harvested from term deliveries at the time of birth. Informed written consent was obtained from subjects . All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.\n1. Isolation of MSCs from cord tissue\nAt the time of delivery, cut at least 5 cm of cord, preferably closer to the placenta, and sterilize the cord by swabbing the outer surface with 70% ethanol. Transfer the piece of cord tissue sequentially from one 50 mL collection tube containing phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to another containing the same. Transport the collection tube bearing the name of the subject on ice to the laboratory within 1 h.\n\tNOTE: For a larger study, it might be useful to barcode the samples to enable their tracking throughout the study. Importantly, all personnel handling human tissues should be offered the full regimen of the hepatitis B vaccine.\nIn the lab, switch on the UV for 25 min in the BSL-2 hood to sterilize autoclaved instruments and pipettes prior to use.\nTransfer the cord tissue piece from the collection tube to a 10 cm2 tissue culture-treated dish containing PBS enriched with 5 g/L glucose, 50 µg/mL gentamicin, 2.5 µg/mL amphotericin B, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin (schematic in Figure 1).\nUsing a scalpel, slice the cord tissue vertically along its longitudinal axis to obtain two half cylindrical pieces. Owing to cord torsion and the mucoid surface, pin down the tissue with a pair of forceps held in the other hand.",
    "At this point, observe the umbilical arteries and vein and remove the blood vessels by using a scalpel to scrape them off in one direction from the surface. Rinse the cord tissue once again in PBS to remove all residual blood associated with the tissue. Ensure that the scraping is gentle to preserve the integrity of cells in the WJ surrounding the vessels.\nMince each half of the cord tissue into 0.5 cm3 sized fragments and place the fragments with the luminal surface facing down on the dish. Incubate the dish briefly for 10 min in a 37 °C humidified chamber containing 5% CO2.\nAfter incubation, flood the dish containing the cord tissue pieces with 20 mL of medium containing MEM Alpha Modification without L-glutamine, ribo- and deoxyribonucleosides, 15% fetal bovine serum (not heat-inactivated), and 50 µg/mL gentamycin. Add the growth medium gently along the sides to prevent the tissue explants from being dislodged from their orientation. Add excess medium to account for a fraction that will be soaked up by the tissue explants during incubation.\nAfter 3 days of incubation, add fresh medium to the cultures. Ensure that the cultures are protected from shocks and movement of the explants while handling the dishes.\nAfter 1 week, remove the tissue fragments individually using sterile forceps and discard using appropriate biohazard bags for disposal. Retain the existing medium and add 10 mL of fresh growth medium. Replace the growth medium every 4 days until individual colonies reach a confluence of 70%.\n\tNOTE: It is likely that the cells will not be uniformly distributed throughout the dish, as there will be individual proliferative colonies that need to be monitored for confluence with time. Generally, within a month, a 10 cm2 dish generates enough cells to be split into a separate dish.",
    "Harvest the adherent cells using trypsin/EDTA solution (1x 0.25% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution [HBSS]). Centrifuge the cell suspension at 470 × g for 5 min at 25 °C and resuspend the cell pellet in growth medium.\n2. Immunophenotyping and propagation of uMSCS\nProceed to immunophenotyping once the adherent cells have reached 50%-60% confluence and are well spread. Do not perform MSC marker analysis on fully confluent cultures, as this tends to cause downregulation of key MSC markers.\nAfter trypsinization, distribute a cell suspension of 1 × 106 cells/mL in FACS tubes (1 × 105 cells/tube) and stain with appropriate fluorophore-linked antibodies (all 1:50 dilution) in combination: unstained; CD105 + CD90; CD105 + CD73; CD105; CD90; CD73; CD34 + CD45 (common fluorophore); isotype controls for each fluorophore. Record a total number of events of at least 10,000 on the flow cytometer for further analysis.\n\tNOTE: Since the cells are analyzed for each surface marker separately, gating on cell subsets is not required.\nIn addition to the above markers, confirm the presence of positive and negative surface markers in uMSC lines created from individual cord tissue samples (Table 1).\nAnalyze the labeled cells by flow cytometry and determine the percentage of CD105+CD90+ and CD105+CD73+ cells. Analyze CD105+ and CD34−CD45− cells separately.\n3. Differentiation of uMSCs into skeletal muscle\nCoat tissue culture plates with 0.01% collagen and 20 µg/mL laminin in PBS. Coat these plates for a minimum of 4 h at room temperature.\nPlate uMSCs at a density of 10,000 cells/cm2 in growth medium.",
    "When the cells are 70% confluent, aspirate the growth medium and rinse the cultures 2x with PBS. Add myogenic differentiation medium (M1) comprising of DMEM + 5% horse serum + 0.1 µM dexamethasone + 50 µM hydrocortisone to the uMSCs. For determination of the kinetics of myogenic progression, add M1 medium every other day to the cultures.\nTo determine the kinetics of myogenic progression, analyze uMSCs for Pax7, MyoD, Myogenin, and MyHC expression at 2 days, 4-5 days, 6-7 days, and 10-14 days, respectively.\nSubscription Required.
