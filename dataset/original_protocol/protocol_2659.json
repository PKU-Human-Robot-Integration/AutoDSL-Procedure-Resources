    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of feeding plates for C. elegans\nTiming: 2 days\nIn this section, freshly prepared bacteria will be spread onto NGM plates in the clean bench.\nPrepare heat-killed E. coli OP50 (HK-E. coli).\nInoculate 200 mL of LB media with a single colony from a new E. coli OP50 streak plate.\nGrow bacteria at 37°C for 16–22 h, shaking at 250 rpm.\nConcentrate the cultured E. coli OP50 (200 mL) to 20 mL (1/10 vol) by centrifuging (2,000 g, 15 min).\nVortex the pellet to resuspend it.\nHeat-kill the concentrated E. coli OP50 in a water bath at 80°C for 120 min.\nSpread 500 μL of the heat-killed E. coli on a LB plate to look for colony growth. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 16–22 h. No bacterial growth confirms the success of heat-killing.\nPrepare S. saprophyticus (ATCC 15305):\nInoculate 5 mL of LB media with a single colony from a new S. saprophyticus (SS) streak plate.\nGrow bacteria at 37°C for 16–22 h, shaking at 250 rpm.\nTransfer 0.5 mL cultured SS (37°C in LB broth) into 50 mL of fresh LB broth. Grow the diluted bacteria at 37°C to OD600 = 0.5, which takes about 5–6 h.\nSeed 300 μL of SS onto each NGM plate (6 cm). Let the SS plates grow at 20°C for 24 h to ensure that they are completely dry.\nCritical: Freshly prepared SS plates are used to assay developmental phenotype. Plates may be kept at 20°C for up to 3 days before use.\nPrepare feeding plates (HK-E. coli + S.saprophyticus):\nMix HK-E. coli OP50 and S.saprophyticus at a 1:1 ratio (ratio = volume: volume).",
    "Note: ratio = volume:volume, for example: 10 mL HK-E. coli OP50 mixed with 10 mL S.saprophyticus. The total amount of bacteria to mix depends on how many plates are required.\nSpread 400 μL of the mixed bacteria onto NGM plates (6 cm), and let the plates dry at 20°C–25°C.\nSynchronize worms\nTiming: 1 day\nIn this step, bleach adult worms to obtain a synchronized L1-staged population, then seed animals onto the NGM plates with SS or HK-E. coli + SS food.\nSynchronize worms and obtain a synchronous L1 population.\nPetri dishes with a large number of laid eggs and well-fed gravid adults are used for egg preparations. 5 plates of well-fed adult animals are required.\nWash adult worms and eggs from each plate with 1 mL M9 buffer, and transfer the worms into a 15 mL tube.\nCollect the worms by centrifugation at 50 g for 3 min.\nRemove the supernatant, and add 5 mL of bleach solution.\nNote: the bleach solution (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) should be freshly made.\nGently resuspend the pelleted worms in this solution, and gently shake the tube for 5 min on a rocker.\nPellet the worms by centrifugation at 50 g for 1 min and remove the bleach solution.\nWash the eggs with M9 buffer (5 mL/tube), centrifuge at 50 g for 1 min. Repeat this step two more times.\nResuspend eggs in 5 mL M9 buffer in a 15 mL tube.\nGently shake the tube for 12–15 h, which will generate synchronized L1-staged worms.\nSeeding of animals and analysis of larval growth\nTiming: 4 days\nSeed L1 animals to the plates.\nPellet synchronized L1 animals in the 15 mL tube and remove the M9 medium.",
    "Resuspend the synchronized L1 in 500 μL M9, and then put 5–10 μL of L1 animals onto a microscope slide and count the number of animals. The ideal animal number is 100–200 worms/10 μL.\nSeed synchronized L1 animals (100–200 worms/10 μL) each plate prepared for the specific assay (SS, HK-E. coli + SS) and incubate at 20°C for 3–4 days.\nNote: At least 3 plates (one plate for each technical replicate) were used for each condition.\nMeasure the developmental rate of the animals at day 4 based on vulval morphology.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nNote: Observe the animals at day 3 and day 4, and measure the developmental stage at day 4."
