    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nFigure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] provides an overview of the protocol.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/364-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Workflow of whole planarian chromosome squash protocol\nStep-by-step breakdown and visualization of the whole planarian chromosome squash protocol.\nColchicine overnight incubation\nTiming: 12–16 h\nSoaking planarians into colchicine solution to freeze mitotic neoblasts.\nSelect control and/or experimental planarians of similar size that are no greater than 1 cm in length and place them into a 6 cm petri dish.\nRemove planarian 1× Montjuic saltwater and replace with 4–5 mL of Colchicine solution.\nAllow planarians to incubate for 12–16 h in the dark.\nCritical: To avoid planarian toxicity induced by colchicine, the incubation period should not exceed 16 h.\nWhole planarian chromosome squash\nTiming: 30–60 min\nFigure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A provides a visual representation of the whole animal procedure.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/364-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Whole planarian chromosome squash and chromosome visualization\n(A) Representative images of planarian squash. Left image is a planarian on a 24 × 60 mm coverslip. Middle image is of the addition of a 22 × 22 mm coverslip on top of the planarian, the initial squashing. Right image is of a fully squashed planarian after application of pressure to the added coverslip. Scale bar, 200 μm.\n(B) Representative images and zoom-ins of chromosome obtained from squashed control and Ubc9(RNAi) animals. Ubc9 is required for DNA damage repair within the planarian, thus, without its function chromosomal abnormalities, such as fusions and deletions, are evident (d, e, f) relative to the control (a, b, c). Scale bar, 50 μm.\nPlanarian tissue will be fixed and heated, assisting with the softening of tissue and separation of cells allowing for chromosomes to be stained by orcein solution.\nPlace one animal per 1.5 mL tube and remove colchicine solution.",
    "Add 0.5–1 mL of 3:1 ethanol: acetic acid fixative to each tube and incubate for 15 min at room temperature (25°C) on an orbital platform rotator.\nNote: In all steps, ensure planarians are fully submerged within the solution and not floating on top.\nReplace solution with 0.5–1 mL 1 N HCl and pre-incubate for 2 min at room temperature (25°C) .\nImmediately incubate at 60°C in a Thermomixer-R for 6 min.\nQuickly remove the HCl solution.\nCritical: At this point tissues are quite soft. Thus, remove all residual HCl without puncturing the planarian by angling the 1.5 mL tube so that the planarian will stick to the wall of the tube.\nAdd 150–200 μL 1% acetic-orcein solution to each tube and incubate at room temperature (25°C) for 15 min.\nCarefully remove the 1% acetic-orcein solution.\nCritical: The planarian will not be seen, as the 1% acetic-orcein solution is dark purple. In most cases, the planarian will be residing at the bottom of the tube. Thus, remove as much solution as possible (∼125–175 μL). The residual liquid will be diluted out with 60% acetic acid solution.\nAdd 500 μL of 60% acetic acid solution and incubate for 5 min.\nWith a transfer pipette gently place animals on a 24 × 60 mm cover slips.\nNote: 25 × 75 mm slides are too thick to view chromosomes at 100× thus, use 24 × 60 mm cover slips.\nAfter planarians are transferred, remove residual 60% acetic acid solution.\nAdd 10–20 μL of 1:1:1 lactic acid: acetic acid: MilliQ H2O on top of each worm and incubate for 5 min.\nRemove excess liquid and add 2 μL of orcein solution to each animal.",
    "Take a 22 × 22 mm cover slip, quickly place it on top of the treated animal and with slight pressure and one continual movement, use your thumb to squash the animal throughout the slide. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1].\nPause Point: Protocol is complete. Slides can be stored at room temperature (25°C) until chromosome viewing. Slides do not require sealing and can be stored at room temperature (25°C) for long-term void of humidity.\nViewing planarian chromosomes\nTiming: 1–2 h\nFigure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B provides representative illustrations of normal and abnormal chromosomes.\nVisualization of planarian chromosomes using a 100× objective.\nView chromosomes with a 100× objective. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1]. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.2].\nTake 20–30 representative fields per animal."
