    "All procedures were approved by the Doshisha University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Three male Long-Evans rats, aged between 24 and 28 weeks (at the start of behavioral training), with body weights of 300-350 g, were used for the present study. The rats were housed individually in home cages (20 cm x 25 cm x 23 cm) on a 12 h light/12 h dark schedule, with the light period starting at 08:00 am. The animals were obtained from a commercial source (see Table of Materials).\n1. Maze system components\nNOTE: The maze system (including all the components, steps 1.1-1.5) (see Table of Materials) must be mounted in a shielded room covered with copper mesh (4 m x 5 m for rats and 1.8 m × 3.0 m for mice) for simultaneous use of electrophysiological neural activity recording. The maze needs to be elevated at a fixed height from the floor (55 cm for rats and 34 cm for mice).\nPunching board\n\t\nPlace the aluminum punching board on the shield room floor (dimensions of the punching board: 360 cm x 480 cm x 1.2 cm for rats; 160 cm x 160 cm x 1.2 cm for mice) (Figure 1F,G).\n\t\tNOTE: The experimenter can stand on the board.\nEquip the punching board with a grid of equally spaced holes (for both rats and mice, 25 mm hole spacing and 6 mm hole diameter) (Figure 2C).\n\t\tNOTE: These holes enable the placement of highly repeatable mazes (Figure 2D).\nTower with baseplate\n\t\nDevelop a tower with a baseplate made of aluminum to form pathways of a fixed height (the dimensions of the stem part of the tower are 55 cm × 6 cm × 2 cm for rats and 34 cm × 1.3 cm × 1.3 cm for mice) (Figure 1A).",
    "Use the baseplate to fix the position of the maze parts (the dimensions of the baseplate are 18 cm × 11 cm × 0.5 cm for rats and 12 cm × 7 cm × 0.3 cm for mice).\nEquip the baseplate with protrusions to connect a grid of equally spaced holes in the punching board (the protrusion diameter is 6 mm) (Figure 2B).\nUse the holes to connect components such as feeders, movable walls, and treadmills (see Table of Materials) equipped with towers with baseplates.\n\t\tNOTE: For rats, the baseplate had four protrusions (length of 8 mm) (Figure 1F) inserted into the holes in the punching board. For mice, the baseplate was too light to support the pathway, so bolts were inserted into the holes (bolt lengths were 14 mm) (Figure 1G).\nMaze pathway\n\tNOTE: The commercially available pathway (49 cm × 10 cm for rats and 39 cm × 5 cm for mice) was made of polyvinyl chloride (thickness of 5 mm for rats and 3 mm for mice) (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nConstruct the smallest part of the maze by placing the pathway in the upper part of the tower (Figure 1B).\nDesign the upper part of the tower to conform the dimensions of bottom side of the pathway (dimensions of the upper part of the tower are 48 cm × 8 cm × 1 cm for rats and 21.9 cm × 3.9 cm × 0.3 cm for mice). To fix the pathway to the tower, place it on top.\nProvide side barriers made of polyvinyl chloride to prevent animals from falling (45 mm for rats and 30 mm for mice).",
    "NOTE: Several patterns are available for connecting the pathways in various ways, such as parts with only one side barrier removed. 3D models of the pathway parts are available (https://github.com/TakahashiLab/ReconfigurableMazeParts) and can be printed using a 3D printer (see ​Table of Materials).\nAccompanying parts\n\tNOTE: The parts required for behavioral experiments can be implemented by attaching a common baseplate with the pathway.\n\t\nPlace feeders on the side of any pathway to change the site of the reward (Figure 1C).\n\t\tNOTE: Animals poking the feeders are detected by the shut-off sensors (see Table of Materials).\nPlace movable walls in the gaps between the pathways to force animals to guide the direction of movement (Figure 1D).\n\t\tNOTE: For rats, when the movable wall is raised, the height of the wall is 90 cm from the floor and 29.5 cm from the side barriers of the pathway. When the movable wall is lowered, the height of the wall is 54 cm from the floor and -5.5 cm from the side barriers of the pathway. For mice, when the movable wall is raised, the height of the wall is 55 cm from the floor and 17 cm from the side barriers of the pathway. When the movable wall is lowered, the height of the wall is 35 cm from the floor and -3 cm from the side barriers of the pathway.\nPlace treadmills with pathways to force running delays at fixed positions (Figure 1E).\nControl box\n\tNOTE: Control each part automatically via the control box (Figure 1H) (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nUse a microcontroller to receive signals from the treadmills and feeders via the control box.\n\t\tNOTE: The shut-off sensor on the feeder and the number of treadmill rotations can be detected.",
    "Use a microcontroller to send activation signals to the treadmills, feeders, and movable wall actuators according to a set task schedule via the control box. Individually control the dispensing and discarding of pellets, and the raising and lowering of the movable wall.\n2. Evaluation of special navigation of rodents in the reconfigurable maze\nNOTE: An animal behavior experiment was conducted using the reconfigurable maze (developed in step 1).\nExample construction of a maze\n\tNOTE: An example of how to assemble a T-shaped maze for rats used in the delayed-alternation task experiment is provided in Figure 3.\n\t\nInsert towers with baseplates into the punching board to form a T-shaped framework (Figure 3A).\nAttach pathways to the upper part of the towers (Figure 3B).\nReplace the pathway in the delayed area with a treadmill (Figure 3C).\n\t\tNOTE: The treadmill can be replaced by a pathway of the same height and length.\nAttach feeders to each edge of the maze (Figure 3D).\nAttach movable walls to the left and right branches (Figure 3E).\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure the animal's paw and tail do not get caught in the gaps between sections.\n\t\t \nAnimals\n\t\nEnsure the body weight of the rats remains between 300 and 350 g, and conduct all behavioral experiments during the daytime.\nTask execution\n\t\nStart-up and connect the control box, microcontroller, and PC.\nWrite a program to set up the task schedule and receive the parameters needed for the experiment.\nWrite the program to the microcontroller and execute a task.\n\t\tNOTE: The example of a set task schedule written in C using a microcontroller board is available in a public repository (https://github.com/TakahashiLab/ReconfigurableMazeExample).\nBehavioral experiment\n\t\nConstruct the desired maze shape (step 2.1).\nMove the rats from the home cages and place them in the arbitrary position of the maze.",
    "Allow the rats to freely explore the constructed maze for 10 min to habituate.\nSet up a program to perform the delayed alternation task with the treadmill23,24.\n\t\tNOTE: The parameters required for the experiment can be obtained automatically by the program settings (e.g., number of poking times, duration of the experiment, treadmill speed, etc.).\nChange the shape of the maze if necessary.\nPlace the rats at the arbitrary position in the maze and execute the training or test of the delayed alternation task.\n\t\tNOTE: In the present study, training sessions were conducted with a gradually increasing delay time and test sessions (with a 5 s delay time).\nReturn the rats to the home cage after each task.\nWipe the maze thoroughly with 70% ethanol after each rat and wait at least 5 min before using the maze again.\n\t\t​NOTE: The parts of the pathway can be detached from the tower so that they can be thoroughly wiped clean of odors and dirt.\n3. Behavioral performance and data analysis\nAnimal trajectory\n\t\nRecord animal behavior during the delayed alternation task with a ceiling-mounted digital video camera (see Table of Materials).\n\t\tNOTE: By placing the camera on the ceiling, the experimenter can constantly record the animals' movements as they run around the maze during the task.\nTrack the running trajectories using markerless pose estimation software25 (see Table of Materials) based on images captured at 50 frames/s."
