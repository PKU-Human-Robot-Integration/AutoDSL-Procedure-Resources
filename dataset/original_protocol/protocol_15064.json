    "The procedures involving the use of animals were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of LSUHSC-S and performed according to the criteria outlined by the National Institutes of Health.\n1. Preparation of Perfusion Solutions\nSonicate a 1% (by weight) stock solution of 1.9 µm diameter microspheres.\nWithdraw ~25-30 x 106 green fluorescent microspheres (that is, ~10 µl of the stock solution) into a 300 µl syringe. Dilute the microspheres by withdrawing an additional 240 µl of saline into the syringe.\nPrepare a 50 µl solution of 2 x 106 molecular weight fluorescent dextran dissolved in sterile saline, with the injected dose in the range of 3-10 mg/kg. Keep the dextran covered in aluminum foil until time for its infusion.\n2. Animal Anesthesia and Vascular Cannulation\nAnesthetize the animal for surgical insertion of vascular cannulas and for stationary positioning under a microscope objective. Many choices of anesthetic protocols are available, with various advantages and disadvantages, and potential effects on systemic parameters. Among the many different choices are a combination of ketamine (100-150 mg/kg), xylazine (10 mg/kg), and acepromazine (2 mg/kg), or a combination of ketamine (50 mg/kg) and pentobarbital (50 mg/kg).  The described procedures are acute and conclude with euthanasia induced by an overdose of pentobarbital (150 mg/kg) followed by a thoracotomy; inclusion of an analgesic is not necessary for the terminal procedure.\nMaintain a heating pad underneath the animal for the remainder of the experiment.\nKeep the eyes moist with phosphate buffered saline during the subsequent surgical insertions of vascular cannulas.",
    "Prepare a vascular cannula for subsequent infusions of fluorescent tracers. A 20 cm length of polyethylene tubing (for example, 0.28 mm inside diameter; 0.61 mm outside diameter) is placed on the tip of a syringe needle, with the sharp end of the needle broken off beforehand by bending back and forth with a hemostat.\nFill a syringe and tubing with heparinized (25 U/ml) saline.\nShave one side of the lower abdomen and make an incision to expose the femoral vein.\nTo cannulate the femoral vein, tie off the vessel with a 5.0 suture, make a partial incision of the vessel (approximately one-half the vessel diameter), and insert the tubing into the vessel, securing the tubing with the suture tied around the cannulated section.\n3. Preparation for Intravital Microscopy\nDilate the pupil of the eye with a drop of 1% tropicamide ophthalmic solution followed by a drop of 2.5% hypromellose ophthalmic solution.\nCover the eye with a 5 mm glass coverslip.\nPlace the animal on a plexiglass board, which will be positioned underneath the microscope objective of an upright microscope. Strategically place surgical gauze underneath the head to allow a direct axis through the objective to the central retina and optic disk.\nFocus through the microscope on the optic disk, finding the disk with a low power 4X objective and using a fluorescein filter.\n4. Infusion of Fluorescent Microspheres to Measure Velocities\nUsing a 4X objective, focus on the retina with the optic disk in the center of the field of view.\nInfuse the fluorescent microsphere solution at a rate of 250 µl/min/kg.\nVideo-record the viewable retina around the optic disk, using a camera exposure time of ~8 msec.\nStop the microsphere infusion when a sufficient duration of video has been recorded (1-2 min); some microsphere solution likely will remain unused.",
    "5. Infusion of a Fluorescent Plasma Marker to Measure Diameters\nUsing a 4X objective, focus on the retina with the optic disk in the center of the field of view.\nInfuse the prepared solution of fluorescent dextran into the femoral vein as a bolus over ~5 sec, while video-recording. This video will help determine the identity of the arterioles vs venules, with the arterioles being perfused first. Perform this step with the camera exposure time set to ~8 msec, although the precise exposure time is not critical.\nSwitch to a 10X objective and 20-40 msec exposure time for improved resolution to video each of the 4-7 arterioles and 4-7 venules in the superficial retina. Focus on (and video-record) approximately one quadrant of the viewable retina at a time, with the center of the optic disk in one corner of the field of view. An attempt should be made to minimize the time that the microscope light illuminates the tissue to reduce the possibility of light/dye-induced phototoxicity17.\n6. Video Analysis\nUsing a micrometer scale, calibrate the video system for a conversion of µm/pixel.\nWith image processing software, play back the recorded video.\nFrom the video of the bolus infusion of fluorescent dextran, identify arterioles vs venules.\nFor each of the 4-7 arterioles and 4-7 venules recorded with the 10X objective, measure the diameters filled with fluorescent dextran, averaging 5 measures of diameter per vessel along the viewable length.\nFor each of the same arterioles and venules, measure the streak length of the fluorescent microspheres, using 10 successive microsphere streaks in each vessel to avoid selection bias. Divide the streak lengths by the exposure time to calculate the microsphere velocity, for example, 160 µm/8 msec = 20 µm/msec = 2 cm/sec. Average the 10 velocities per vessel.",
    "Calculate the volumetric flow rate for each vessel with the following equation: flow = mean velocity × π × diameter2/4.\nSum the arteriolar flow rates, and separately the venular flow rates, to obtain total retinal blood flow.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
