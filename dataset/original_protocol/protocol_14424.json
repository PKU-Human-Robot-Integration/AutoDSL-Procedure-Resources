    "The study was approved by the data protection officials at Oslo University Hospital and the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics, Southern Norway 2419/2011. All participants signed a written informed consent at inclusion.\n1. Preparations\nNOTE: A timeline for the procedures is outlined in Figure 1.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55847/55847fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Flowchart Describing the Timing and the Personnel Involved in the 4-vessel Sampling Procedure.\nOne color represents one person.

Label the vacutainers and tubes. See tentative list of equipment.\n2. Maternal Characteristics\nRecord the maternal clinical and non-clinical characteristics at inclusion and repeat relevant questions and measurements, including weight, at the time of delivery. Record the duration of the fasting period prior to the cesarean section, and any hypotensive episodes occurring during the surgery.\n\tNote: Include the minimal maternal clinical dataset reported in a recent publication from Global Pregnancy CoLaboratory (COLAB). This article also includes some very important aspects in choosing study populations and should be addressed while planning the study 18.\nConsider recording paternal characteristics, including ethnicity, age and body mass index (BMI).\n3. Ultrasound",
    "Perform the Doppler ultrasound examination on the day of the delivery, with the women in a fasting state. Perform the examination during a period of fetal quiescence, with the woman in semi-supine position, tilted slightly laterally opposite to the region of interest in order to avoid compression of the aorta and vena cava. Monitor the output intensity by the mechanical and thermal indices on the display.\nUmbilical vein\nVisualize the umbilical vein in a sagittal or oblique transection of the fetal abdomen. Measure the internal vessel diameter in the straight portion of the intra-abdominal umbilical vein, before any visible branches. Use regular B-mode and visualize the vessel in a perpendicular insonation angle for diameter measurements and keep several optimal frames for later measurements to minimize the effect of pulsatile diameter changes.\n\t\t\nRepeat the measurements five to ten times 19.\nAt the same site, use Doppler ultrasound and adjust the probe to get an insonation angle as low as possible (always <30°) in order to measure the time-averaged maximum velocity (TAMX). Obtain the velocity over a period of 3 - 5 s (non-pulsating flow).\nUterine artery\nUse Doppler ultrasound to visualize the uterine artery as it crosses the external iliac artery, immediately after it branches from the internal iliac artery. Adjust the probe at this site to get a low insonation angle (always <30°) and measure TAMX. Obtain the velocity as the mean velocity of three heart cycles.\nAs it is unlikely to get a perpendicular angle at the same site as TAMX is measured, follow the vessel distally to get a correct angle for diameter measurements as close to the sites of diameter measurements as achievable. Exclude the diameter measurements if any visible vessels branch off before this site as evaluated by color Doppler ultrasound.",
    "Use regular B-mode and visualize the vessel in a perpendicular insonation angle for diameter measurements and keep several optimal frames for later measurements to minimize the effect of pulsatile diameter changes.\nRepeat the measurements five to ten times 19.\nNote the position of the placenta.\n4. 4-vessel Blood Sampling\nNOTE: The timeline for the procedures is outlined in Figure 1 and an overview of the samples is illustrated in Figure 2.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55847/55847fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: Schematic Illustration of the Placental Vasculature and the Sampling Sites.\nIn the 4-vessel sampling method blood samples are drawn from the uterine vein, the radial artery (as a proxy for the uterine artery) and the umbilical arteries and vein. Blood flow in the uterine artery and the umbilical vein is measured by ultrasound. Tissue samples from the placenta are collected. Illustration: Øystein H. Horgmo, University of Oslo.

Glasses are optional.\nProvide personnel handling the blood samples with gloves.\nProvide personnel handling the placenta samples with gloves and surgical mask. Homogenization requires the use of hoods.\nPreparation in the operation theater\nGive a briefing and hand the equipment to all personnel that will assist the sampling before onset of surgery.\nAddress the anesthesiologist and anesthesiology nurse who will assist with the necessary peripheral arterial and venous access, and ensure that no liquids are given intravenously before sampling.",
    "Give three syringes (10 mL) without needles to the person assisting with the antecubital vein sample and two syringes (one 20 mL and one 10 mL) and one blood gas syringe (with heparin) to the person assisting with the radial artery.\nPrepare two sterile syringes (20 mL), five sterile syringes (10 mL), three \"butterfly needles\" and two blood gas syringes for the operation field.\nAccess to blood vessels.\nFollow standard procedure before the cesarean section to assure peripheral intravenous (iv) access.\n\t\tNOTE: The antecubital vein is preferable because it is easier to draw samples from this site.\nLocalize the radial artery at the wrist by ultrasound or by palpation. Following 0.5 mL of subcutaneous lidocaine analgesia, place an arterial line into the radial artery. Abandon the sampling from this site in case of three failed insertions, or if the woman experiences pain during the insertion.\n\t\tNOTE: Perform the surgical procedure of cesarean section according to standard procedure. Only the adjustments needed for the sampling procedure are underlined below.\nMaternal blood samples\n\tNOTE: Obtain all three maternal blood samples (uterine vein, radial artery and antecubital vein) simultaneously before the uterine incision.\n\t\nFor the uterine vein, after opening the abdominal cavity, use a retractor to lift the abdominal wall and expose the main branches of the uterine veins on the anterolateral sides of the uterus. Obtain blood from uterine vein branches at the same side as the placenta whenever possible or use the most prominent vein plexus if the placenta is located in the uterine midline.",
    "Insert a butterfly needle on a blood gas syringe in the uterine vein at an angle of approximately 30 degrees and collect blood through gentle aspiration to avoid hemolysis. While carefully securing the iv position of the butterfly needle, replace the filled blood gas syringe by a 20 mL and a 10 mL syringe consecutively.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Optimal access is best ensured when standing on the contralateral side of the chosen uterine vein.\nFor the radial artery, aspirate from the intra-arterial line. Discard the first 5 mL, and then aspirate 3 mL in heparin syringe for blood gas analyses, followed by 3 mL in two syringes (20 + 10 mL).\nFor the antecubital vein, aspirate gently from the intravenous catheter. Discard the first 5 mL, and then aspirate 30 mL in three syringes (10 mL).\nPerform a final inspection of the sampling site on the uterine vein before starting to close the abdomen.\nFetal blood samples\nWhen the child is born, immediately aspirate blood from the umbilical artery, without clamping the umbilical cord or delivering the placenta. Start with the syringe for blood gas analysis, and follow with three 10 mL syringes if possible.\nWhen the arterial samples are secured, clamp the cord and hand the child to the midwife before sampling from the umbilical vein (blood gas and 20 + 10 mL syringes).\n\t\tNOTE: Obtain all umbilical samples within seconds of delivery and with the placenta in situ unless it has detached spontaneously.\nFollow the Norwegian recommendations on late cord clamping. In case of a distressed child, clamp and cut the cord immediately and the hand the child to the midwife and neonatologist.\nHandling of blood samples",
    "Put the blood gas syringes on ice while preparing the rest of the blood samples, and analyze them in a blood gas analyzer within 5 min.\nTransfer the blood samples immediately to vacutainers and place the plasma tubes on a rocker for 1 - 2 min before putting them on ice. Leave the serum tubes on the laboratory bench to settle for 30 minutes.\n\t\tNOTE: This is a critical step in the procedure that needs extra attention because samples from all five sites have to be prepared simultaneously to ensure good quality.\nCentrifuge the plasma samples as soon as possible, and within 30 min, at 6 °C, 2,500 x g for 20 min.\nAfter 30 min, centrifuge the serum samples at room temperature for 10 min at 2,500 x g.\nAliquot the supernatants carefully to 2 mL cryo tubes, leaving 0.5 mL of the supernatant above the pellet to ensure platelet free plasma.\nStore the samples at -80 °C.\n5. Collection of Placental Tissue\nPlace the placenta flat down on an ice chilled dissection tray as soon as possible after it has been delivered. Photographand measure the longest diameter and the diameter at 90 degrees. \nWeigh the placenta.\nRecord the weight, the two diameters, any gross pathology, number of vessels in the cord and the time interval from delivery to when the placenta was placed on ice.\n\tNOTE: Send the placenta to pathological examination if clinically indicated.\nPlace the placenta with the maternal surface facing up and identify 4 - 5 sampling sites randomly located in each quadrant of the placenta, avoiding areas of frank pathology. Remove the decidua using scissors to cut away 3 - 5 mm from the maternal surface. Collect a 1 - 2 cm3 piece of villous tissue from each site.",
    "Wash the collected tissue gently in 50 mL of cold 1M PBS. Divide into several pieces from each sampling site and aliquot.\n\tNote: The size of the placenta pieces will depend on the planned analyzes.\nAdd aliquots of 0.1 - 0.5 cm3 tissue samples to 5 cryo tubes and snap freeze in liquid nitrogen.\nAdd small pieces of 0.1 - 0.2 cm3 to the tube with 25 mL of RNA stabilization solution. Store at 4 °C for 24 h, discard the RNA stabilization solution and replace it. Freeze.\nAdd pieces of 0.5 cm3 to the 5 cryo tubes with 0.5 mL of OCT, top up with OCT, mix and freeze.\nStore the samples at -80 °C until analysis.\n\tNOTE: Burton et al. provides an excellent overview of practical aspects of placental sampling depending on the analyses planned. 20 Consider to prepare the remaining tissue for isolation of the microvillous and basal membranes, and to collect decidual tissue by vacuum suction technique. 21,22\n6. Neonatal Characteristics\nRecord the neonatal characteristics, including Apgar-score (1, 5 and 10 min), sex, weight, length, gestational age and admission to Newborn Intensive Care Unit (length and outcome of stay).\nConsider measuring neonatal body composition by anthropometric measurements, air-displacement plethysmograph or dual X-ray absorptiometry.23,24\n7. Calculations\nAssume similar blood composition in the radial and uterine artery and calculate the uteroplacental arteriovenous concentration difference.\nUteroplacental arteriovenous concentration difference = CA - CV\nUmbilical venous - arterial concentration difference = Cv - Ca\n\tWhere C is concentration with subscripts: A, the radial artery; V, the uterine vein; v the umbilical vein and a, the umbilical artery.\nCalculate the volume blood flow, mL/min (Q):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55847/55847eq1.jpg",
    "Where D is the vessel diameter (cm), TAMX is time averaged maximum velocity and h is the coefficient for the spatial blood velocity profile. Use 0.5 as the coefficient for the umbilical vein and 0.6 for the uterine artery25,26.\nCalculate the placental uptake and release according to Fick's principle:\nUteroplacental uptake = (CA - CV) x Qm\n\tFetal uptake = (Cv - Ca) x Qf\n\tSubscripts: m, maternal and f, fetal.\nSubscription Required.
