    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of conditioned media\nTiming: 2–3 days\nFor the identification of shedding substrates, it is preferable to investigate the proteins secreted into the cell culture media, rather than those remaining in the membrane, because the secretome is much less complex than the membrane proteome. Here, we prepare conditioned media of A431 cells treated with PMA and exposed to DMSO or BB-94 in order to quantitatively identify metalloprotease substrates that are downregulated by BB-94 treatment.\nA431 cells are maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. Seed 5–10 million A431 cells onto each of eighteen 15 cm dishes (3 dishes × 3 replicates × 2 conditions (DMSO or BB-94) = 18 dishes) on the day before media conditioning. Culture media from three dishes are merged as a replicate later.\nNote: The number of cells that should be seeded depends on the cell type. In our protocol, the media conditioning is performed with 90% confluent cells. We prepare more culture media than needed (in total 30 mL from three 15 cm dishes in this workflow) in order to ensure the availability of a sufficient amount of protein. The protein yields from the conditioned media of 10 human cell lines were reported in our previous paper (Tsumagari et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nWash cells three times with 20 mL of PBS(+).\nNote: Repetitive cell washing is important to avoid serum contamination. However, some cell lines, e.g., HEK293T cells, easily become detached from the dish during cell washing. To minimize cell detachment, use PBS including Ca2+ and Mg2+ (PBS(+)), serum-free medium, or Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) including Ca2+ and Mg2+ (HBSS(+)).",
    "For inhibitor pretreatment, incubate cells with 10 mL of fresh serum-free medium including 10 μM BB-94 or DMSO at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 for 1 h. Note that the inhibitor pretreatment is required to distribute this drug into cells completely before activation of sheddases with PMA.\nFor media conditioning, remove the media for inhibitor pretreatment (step 3) and incubate the cells with 10 mL of fresh serum-free medium including 1 μM PMA and 10 μM BB-94 or DMSO at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 for 1 h.\nNote: HBSS(+) can be used instead of serum-free medium. For media conditioning, we employ as small a solution volume as possible to reduce the time required for concentration (step 8).\nNote: When using PMA, a shedding activator, we employ a short incubation time of 1 h. If such a reagent is not used, we recommend a longer incubation time such as for 16 h in the presence of inhibitor or DMSO to obtain a sufficient protein amount for the experiment (at least 20 μg: 10 μg each for N- and C-terminal peptide enrichment).\nCollect the culture supernatant as conditioned media on ice. The supernatants of three dishes are pooled to make a biological replicate (total 30 mL).\nCentrifuge the collected conditioned media at 3,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C to remove cell debris and transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube.\nAdd 0.3 mL of 200 mM EDTA-NaOH, 0.3 mL of 200 mM EGTA-NaOH, 0.3 mL of 100 mM PMSF, and 30 μL of 100x protease inhibitor cocktail (0.1% at final concentration) to 30 mL of conditioned medium.",
    "Critical: To avoid inhalation of PMSF, perform all operations with PMSF in a certified chemical fume hood while wearing appropriate personal protective equipment, such as gloves and safety goggles.\nPause point: Samples can be stored at –80°C for several weeks until use.\nProtein purification, reduction, and alkylation\nTiming: 8 h\nTransfer the conditioned medium to an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter and centrifuge at 3,000 × g at 4°C to reduce the sample volume to 200 μL.\nAlternatives: Centrifugal filters from other manufacturers can be used, as long as they can reduce the sample volume to ∼200 μL. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions.\nNote: If the sample volume is larger than the capacity of the centrifugal filter, load and enrich as much sample as possible, and then separately load the remaining sample. The time needed for reducing the sample volume to 200 μL is likely to differ depending on the samples. In our experiments, it takes 4–7 h.\nNote: The sample volume should be reduced in order to perform protein extraction in a single microtube according to the following procedures. If the concentrated sample volume becomes less than 200 μL, add flow-through solution to adjust the volume.\nProtein purification using methanol and chloroform. Transfer the sample from the Amicon Ultra centrifugal tube to a 2 mL microtube.\nAdd 600 μL of methanol (3 times the sample volume), and mix vigorously for 1 min.\nAdd 150 μL of chloroform (0.75 times the sample volume), and mix vigorously for 1 min.\nAdd 450 μL of ultrapure water (2.25 times the sample volume), and mix vigorously for 1 min.\nCentrifuge at 20,000 × g for 5 min at 25°C .\nRemove the upper phase.",
    "Gently add 450 μL of methanol (2.25 times the sample volume), and carefully mix with the lower layer by gently swinging the tube.\nCritical: Do not use vortex mixing at step 9f. If you see a white disc of protein (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]), keep it as intact as possible. If the protein amount is very low, vigorous mixing could reduce the protein yield.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/838-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Example of protein purification with methanol-chloroform\nThe white disc between the methanol and chloroform is a protein layer.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/838-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Number of identified peptides\n(A) The numbers of identified terminal peptides, proteolytic terminal peptides, and proteolytic terminal peptides in N- and C-terminal peptides are shown. Peptide uniqueness is based on sequence and modification.\n(B) The number of identified peptides in each fraction is shown for C-terminomics.\nCentrifuge at 20,000 × g for 5 min at 25°C.\nRemove the supernatant, and dry the pellet by leaving the tube tab open for 2 min.\nDissolve the protein pellet in 200 μL of PTS buffer.\nNote: If the protein pellet is hard to dissolve, sonication is effective.\nMeasure the protein concentration by BCA assay. The expected amount of protein yield is described in the Expected Outcomes section.\nAlternatives: Other protein quantification methods, such as Bradford assay, can be used.\nAdd 20 μL (1/10 volume) of 100 mM TCEP and 20 μL (1/10 volume) of 400 mM CAA, and mix the solution using a vortex mixer. Incubate at 95°C for 5 min.\nCalculate the protein concentration of the sample considering the volume of added TCEP and CAA.\nPause point: The samples can be stored at –80°C for several weeks until use.\nProtein digestion for N-terminomics (LysargiNase digestion)\nTiming: 2 days",
    "Digestion is performed based on the reported phase-transfer surfactant (PTS) method (Chang et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Masuda et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). PTSs, such as SDC and SLS, increase the solubility of hydrophobic proteins, and can be removed from acidified solution containing peptides by adding ethyl acetate. PTSs are predominantly transferred to the organic phase, while the digested peptides remain in the aqueous phase under the acidic condition. Importantly, peptides for N-terminal peptide enrichment should be prepared with LysargiNase, which cleaves proteins at the N-terminal side of Lys and Arg. In LysargiNase digests, non-terminal peptides have sequences starting with Lys or Arg, while N-terminal peptides have neither Lys nor Arg. Thus, N-terminal peptides can be isolated by means of SCX (steps 44–55) due to their weaker retention. In reported work (Chang et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Tsumagari et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]), we used TrypN, which is an alternative to LysargiNase purchased from Protifi (Cat#K-20), but this is no longer manufactured. Here, we set 10 μg peptides as input for one experiment.\nTake 10 μg of protein sample dissolved in PTS buffer (from step 13).\nDilute 10-fold with 10 mM CaCl2.\nAdd 0.2 μg of LysargiNase (50:1, w/w).\nIncubate for 16 h at 37°C with agitation at 700 rpm.\nAdd an equal volume of ethyl acetate and 10% by volume of 10% TFA (0.5% final concentration).\nVigorously mix with a vortex mixer for 2 min.\nCentrifuge at 15,700–20,000 × g for 2 min at 25°C.\nCarefully remove the upper phase (organic phase), which includes the surfactants.\nNote: You might see a white disc between the aqueous phase and the organic phase (similar to the disc observed in protein purification with methanol-chloroform, step 9; Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). This does not affect the following analyses. Keep it intact while removing the organic phase.",
    "Dry the peptide sample using a SpeedVac to remove remaining ethyl acetate.\nPurify the peptide by using a reversed-phase StageTip as described later (steps 36–43).\nPause point: The peptide-loaded and washed StageTips can be stably stored at −20°C.\nProtein digestion for C-terminomics (trypsin/LysC digestion)\nTiming: 2 days\nDigestion is performed based on the PTS method (Chang et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Masuda et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]), as well as LysargiNase digestion (steps 14–23). Note that trypsin and LysC, instead of LysargiNase, should be used. Proteins are cleaved at C-terminal side of Lys and Arg in trypsin/LysC digestion. The non-terminal peptides have sequences ending with Lys or Arg, while C-terminal peptides have neither Lys nor Arg. Thus, C-terminal peptides can be isolated by means of SCX (steps 64–76) due to their weaker retention.\nTake 10 μg of protein sample dissolved in PTS buffer (from step 13).\nDilute 5-fold with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate.\nAdd 0.2 μg of LysC (50:1, w/w).\nIncubate at 37°C for 3 h with agitation at 700 rpm.\nAdd 0.2 μg of trypsin (50:1, w/w).\nNote: 100:1 to 20:1 (protein:trypsin, w/w) can be used according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\nIncubate 16 h at 37°C with agitation at 700 rpm.\nAdd an equal volume of ethyl acetate and 10% volume of 10% TFA (0.5% final concentration).\nVigorously mix with vortex for 2 min.\nCentrifuge at 15,700–20,000 × g for 2 min at 25°C.\nCarefully remove the upper phase (organic phase), which includes the surfactants.\nNote: You might see a white disc between the aqueous phase and the organic phase (similar to the disc observed in protein purification with methanol-chloroform, step 9; Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). This does not affect the following analyses. Keep it intact during removal of the organic phase.\nDry the peptide sample using a SpeedVac to remove remaining ethyl acetate.",
    "Purify the peptide on a reversed-phase StageTip as described later (steps 36–43).\nPause point: The peptide-loaded and washed StageTips can be stably stored at −20°C.\nPeptide purification\nTiming: 1 h\nIn order to remove interfering chemicals, such as salts, peptides are purified by reversed-phase chromatography. Here, we use StageTips packed with double 16-gauge SDB-XC membranes. This peptide purification process appears 4 times in this workflow (N1, N2, C1, and C2; see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). In order to distinguish these repeated steps, the respective peptide purification steps are referred to as, for example, “Peptide purification (N1)” or “step 43 (N1)”.\nCritical: In peptide purification of TMT-labeled trypsin/LysC digests (C2; Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]), the peptide amount is in total 60 μg (10 μg × 6 samples are mixed at step 61). Thus, divide the digests into three parts and purify them using three StageTips, considering the SDB-XC membrane capacity. Otherwise, use single StageTip per sample.\nDissolve the peptide sample (from steps 23, 35, or 63) in 20–40 μL of buffer A.\nNote: If the peptide pellet is hard to dissolve (particularly peptides just after digestion), add 2 M guanidine chloride to buffer A in this step. Chaotropic agents such as guanidine chloride facilitates dissolution. Sonication for 2–5 min is also effective.\nPrepare SDB-XC StageTips, and set 2 mL microtubes as receivers.\nConditioning. Wet the membranes by passing 50 μL of buffer B through the StageTip.\nEquilibration. Add 50 μL of buffer A to the StageTip just before buffer B has completely left the tip, and pass buffer A through the tip. Stop before buffer A has completely left the tip.\nSample loading. Load the peptide sample (from step 36) onto the tip, and pass the sample solvent through the tip.",
    "Wash. Add 50 μL of buffer A just before the sample has completely left the tip, and pass buffer A through the tip.\nPause point: The peptide-loaded and washed StageTips can be stably stored at −20°C.\nCritical: Change the receiver tube to a new 1.5 mL microtube to collect the eluate at the next step.\nElution. Apply 50 μL of buffer B, and collect the eluate.\nDry the eluate in a SpeedVac.\nN-terminal peptide enrichment\nTiming: 2 h\nThe N-terminal peptides in LysargiNase-digests can be separated from the non-terminal peptides on SCX due to their weaker retention by SCX at low pH. The principle was described in detail previously (Chang et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nCritical: Isobaric labeling such as TMT alters the charge distribution of peptides and affects the enrichment efficiency. The TMT-labeling step should be performed after N-terminal peptide enrichment, which is different from the case of C-terminal peptide enrichment (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nDissolve the purified LysargiNase digests (from step 43 (N1, Figure 1)[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) of a 10 μg protein sample in 50 μL of N-loading buffer.\nPrepare a StageTip with double 16-gauge SCX membranes, and set it on a 2 mL microtube as a receiver tube.\nConditioning. Wet the membranes by passing 50 μL of methanol through the StageTip.\nAdd 50 μL of buffer B to the StageTip just before the methanol has completely left the tip, and pass buffer B through the tip.\nActivation. Add 100 μL of SCX-activation buffer to the StageTip just before buffer B has completely left the tip, and pass SCX-activation buffer through the tip.\nEquilibration. Add 150 μL of N-loading buffer to the StageTip just before the SCX-activation buffer has completely left the tip, and pass N-loading buffer through the tip.",
    "Again, add 150 μL of N-loading buffer to the StageTip just before the previously applied N-loading buffer has left the tip, and pass N-loading buffer through the tip. Stop before the N-loading buffer has completely left the tip.\nCritical: Change the receiver tube to a new 1.5 mL microtube to collect the flow-through fraction of steps 51–52 in the following sample loading step and wash step.\nSample loading. Load the sample dissolved in N-loading buffer (from step 44) onto the tip, and pass the sample through the tip.\nWash. Add 50 μL of N-loading buffer just before the sample has completely left the tip, and pass the N-loading buffer through the tip.\nCollect the solution (flow-through of steps 51–52) in the receiver tube as an N-terminal peptide sample.\nDry the obtained N-terminal peptides in a SpeedVac.\nLabel the enriched peptides with TMT according to the following steps 56–63.\nPause point: The evaporated peptides can be stored at –80°C for several weeks until use.\nTMT labeling\nTiming: 2 h\nSamples are multiplexed with TMT reagents (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). TMT-labeling is particularly important in the C-terminal peptide enrichment step, since the additional positive charges on the peptides facilitate separation of C-terminal peptides from non-terminal peptides. If sample multiplexing is not employed, we recommend the use of TMT-zero reagent (Cat#90067, Thermo Fisher Scientific), which is much cheaper than TMT reagents labeled with stable isotopes. The N-terminal peptides should be TMT-labeled after N-terminal peptide enrichment, because TMT-labeling affects the enrichment efficiency in N-terminal peptide enrichment (steps 36–43, Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_838_9.csv\nDissolve the peptides (from step 43 (C1) or 55) in 5 μL of 200 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 8.5).\nAlternatives: 3-[4-(2-Hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl]propanesulfonic acid (EPPS), rather than HEPES, may be more suitable for buffering at pH 8.5 (Navarrete-Perea et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).",
    "Mix the peptide solution with 0.1 mg of TMT reagent dissolved in 5 μL of acetonitrile in a vortex mixer.\nIncubate the solution at 25°C with agitation at 700 rpm.\nAdd 5 μL of 1% hydroxylamine for quenching excess reagents.\nAdd 10 μL of 10% TFA to stop the reaction.\nMix the samples (TMT 6-plex).\nDry the sample in a SpeedVac.\nPurify the peptide using a reversed-phase StageTip as described already (steps 36–43). See the “CRITICAL” description regarding the peptide purification (C2) process.\nC-terminal peptide enrichment\nTiming: 2 h\nIn our protocol for C-terminal peptide enrichment, the C-terminal peptides in trypsin/LysC-digests can be separated from the non-terminal peptides by SCX due to their weaker retention on SCX at low pH. TMT labeling introduces additional positive charges on the peptides, facilitating the separation of C-terminal peptides from non-terminal peptides. Thus, even if you do not perform a multiplexed experiment, label the peptides with TMT-zero reagent. The 6-plexed TMT sample is subjected to C-terminal peptide enrichment using three SCX-StageTips (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nDissolve 60 μg of purified TMT-labeled peptides (from step 43 (C2)) in 150 μL of C-loading buffer.\nPrepare three SCX-StageTips, and set them on 2 mL microtubes as receiver tubes.\nConditioning. Wet the SCX-membranes by passing 50 μL of methanol through the StageTip.\nAdd 50 μL of buffer B to the StageTip just before the methanol has completely left the tip, and pass buffer B through the tip.\nActivation. Add 100 μL of SCX-activation buffer to the StageTip just before buffer B has completely left the tip, and pass SCX-activation buffer through the tip.\nEquilibration. Add 150 μL of C-loading buffer to the StageTip just before the SCX-activation buffer has completely left the tip, and pass C-loading buffer through the tip.",
    "Again, add 150 μL of C-loading buffer to the StageTip just before the previously applied C-loading buffer has completely left the tip, and pass C-loading buffer through the tip. Stop before the C-loading buffer has completely left the tip.\nCritical: Change the receiver tube to a new 1.5 mL microtube to collect the flow-through fraction in the following sample loading step and wash step.\nSample loading. Load 50 μL (one-third) of sample solution dissolved in C-loading buffer (from step 64) onto the tip.\nWash. Add 50 μL of C-loading buffer just before the sample has completely left the tip, and pass the C-loading buffer through the tip.\nCollect the solution (flow-through of steps 71–72) in the receiver tube as the “flow-through fraction” of C-terminal peptides.\nCritical: Change the receiver tube to a new 1.5 mL microtube to collect the peptides eluted by C-0.5% TFA buffer in the next step.\nAdd 50 μL of C-0.5% TFA buffer to the StageTip just before the C-loading buffer has completely left the tip, and pass C-0.5% TFA buffer through the tip.\nCollect the eluate as the “0.5% TFA fraction” of C-terminal peptides.\nDry the obtained C-terminal peptides in a SpeedVac.\nNote: The evaporated peptide sample can be subjected to nanoLC/MS/MS analysis.\nNano-scale liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry\nTiming: 24 h\nFor N-terminal peptide analysis, one-third of the peptides is injected, and triplicate analyses are carried out (3 LC/MS/MS runs). For C-terminal peptide analysis, three sets of flow-through and 0.5% TFA fractions are subjected to single-shot analysis, respectively (6 LC/MS/MS runs) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).",
    "Here, we describe an example of nanoLC/MS/MS analysis, which we employed in our reported work (Tsumagari et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). The nanoLC/MS/MS system comprises an UltiMate 3000RSLCnano pump (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides are injected by an HTC-PAL autosampler (CTC Analytics), loaded onto a 15 cm fused-silica emitter packed with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ (3 μm; Dr. Maisch), and separated by a linear gradient, that is, 5% B for 1 min, 5–15% B in 4 min, 15–40% B in 100 min, 40–99% B in 5 min, and 99% B for 10 min (Solvent A, 0.5% acetic acid; solvent B, 0.5% acetic acid in 80% ACN) at the flow rate of 500 nL/min. The ionization voltage is set to 2,400 V. All MS1 spectra are acquired over the range of 375–1500 m/z in the Orbitrap analyzer (resolution = 120,000, maximum injection time = 50 ms, automatic gain control = 4e5). For the subsequent MS/MS analysis, precursor ions are selected and isolated in top-speed mode (cycle time = 3 s, isolation window = 1.4 m/z), activated by higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD; normalized collision energy = 38), and separated and detected in the Orbitrap analyzer (resolution = 50,000, maximum injection time = 105 ms, automatic gain control = 1e5). The dynamic exclusion time is set to 30 s.\nNote: In order to increase the accuracy of peptide identification by database searching, we recommend using the high-resolution Orbitrap analyzer for both MS1 and MS2 acquisition.\nNanoLC/MS/MS raw data processing\nTiming: 6 h",
    "We here describe an example of nanoLC/MS/MS raw data processing using MaxQuant (v.1.6.7.0), which is a free and widely used suite including the Andromeda search engine (Cox and Mann, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Cox et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Tyanova et al., 2016a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). Database search is implemented against the UniProtKB/SwissProt (https://www.uniprot.org/[href=https://www.uniprot.org/]) human database, concatenated with commonly observed contaminant protein sequences set in MaxQuant. The following parameters are applied: two analysis groups were made in MaxQuant, enabling one combined analysis for LysargiNase with N-terminal free semi-specificity (N-terminal peptides) and trypsin/P with C-terminal free semi-specificity (C-terminal peptides); analysis type is set to 10-plexed TMT quantification at the MS2 level; minimal peptide length is set to 7 amino acids; Cysteine carbamidomethylation is set as a fixed modification, while methionine oxidation and acetylation on the protein N terminus are allowed as variable modifications; false discovery rate is set to 1% at the peptide-spectrum match and protein level, respectively. Details of the procedure for usage of MaxQuant have been described previously (Tyanova et al., 2016a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nNote: The time needed for the data processing is strongly dependent on the performance of the PC running the software."
