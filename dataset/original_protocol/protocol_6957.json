    "Zebrafish maintenance and larvae collectionMaintain adult zebrafish in a recirculation system at 28.5°C under 14:10 h light:dark cycle according to the standard protocol (Westerfield, 2000).Place female and male adult zebrafish in a breeding tank with a divider that separates fish to avoid immediate mating.Obtain fertilized eggs [embryos, 0 days post fertilization (dpf)] by removing the divider the next morning.Raise zebrafish embryos in E3 medium in a 100 mm cell culture dish at 28.5°C.At 1 dpf, transfer embryos with 2.5 ml of E3 medium into a 35 mm cell culture dish and add 150 μl of 20 mg/ml pronase.After 15 min incubation at room temperature (RT), dechorionate embryos by stirring the dish.Transfer embryos to a 100 mm cell culture dish with 20 ml of E3 medium and raise them up to 5 dpf at 28.5°C.Place zebrafish larvae (5 dpf larvae) in the recirculation system (30 larvae/tank).Feed zebrafish larvae in the recirculation system both paramecia and Gemma Micro ZF 75 twice a day from 5 to 30 dpf.Feed juveniles (30-90 dpf) and adults (~90 dpf) both brine shrimp and Otohime B2 twice a day after 30 dpf (         Wakamatsu et al., 2019        ).RNA extraction from zebrafish larvae and juvenilesNote: Use nuclease-free tips in all RNA extraction steps. Larvae (approximately 4-12 dpf, size smaller than 5 mm)Anesthetize a zebrafish larva in 20 ml of 0.2 mg/ml Tricaine at RT for 3 min.Prepare 100 μl of TRI Reagent-LS in 8-strip tube.Place a single zebrafish larva inside of a cap of the 8-strip tube and remove water using a micropipette (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4136/bioprotoc-11-17-4136-g002.jpgFigure 2. Zebrafish larvae placed in the tip of the 8-strip tube dome cap Assemble the cap to the 8-strip tube with each well containing the TRI Reagent, and lyse larvae completely by vortexing for 1 min at RT.",
    "Move to the RNA purification steps immediately or store the 100 μl lysates at -80°C for 1 month.Larva (approximately 14-38 dpf, size smaller than 10 mm)Anesthetize a zebrafish larva in 20 ml of 0.2 mg/ml Tricaine at RT for 3 min.Transfer a zebrafish larva in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube with a Biomasher II and remove excess water using a micropipette.Add 50 μl of TRI Reagent-LS to the larva and immediately mash it at RT using a pestle until it is completely crushed.Add 50 μl of TRI Reagent-LS and vortex the sample for 1 min at RT.Move to the RNA purification steps immediately or store the 100 μl lysates at -80°C for 1 month.Juvenile (approximately 38 dpf, size larger than 10 mm)Anesthetize a zebrafish juvenile in 20 ml of 0.2 mg/ml Tricaine at RT for 3 min.Place a juvenile zebrafish in a 120 mm mortar and remove water by wiping the juvenile using Kimwipes.Pour liquid nitrogen to quickly freeze the juvenile.Grind the frozen juvenile into powder using a pestle (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4136/bioprotoc-11-17-4136-g003.jpgFigure 3. Image of a juvenile zebrafish on a mortar for grinding Add 1 ml of TRI Reagent-LS to the frozen powder and mix using a pestle until the mixture becomes liquid.Note: TRI Reagent-LS is frozen before the completion of tissue lysis. To lyse tissues completely, defrosting the regents is essential. Placing the mortar on a water bath (40-50°C) is sufficient to defrost the regents in a short time. The integrity of the RNA is not affected by this warming. Transfer 100 μl of the lysate to a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.Move to the RNA purification steps immediately or store the 100 μl lysates at -80°C for 1 month.Note: For reuse, the mortar should be washed with distilled water until the lysate is completely removed.",
    "RNA PurificationAdd 100 μl of 99.5% ethanol to the 100 μl lysate and mix by vortexing at RT.Note: When the lysate is stored in -80°C, thaw it at RT prior to this step. Prepare the AcroPrep Advance 96-Well Filter Plate on a reservoir (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4136/bioprotoc-11-17-4136-g004.jpgFigure 4. AcroPrep Advance 96-Well Filter Plate on a reservoir Transfer the 200 μl mixture into each well of the AcroPrep Advance plate.Centrifuge at 1,300 × g for 4 min at RT. Discard the flowthrough.Add 400 μl of 99.5% ethanol and centrifuge the plate at 1,300 × g for 4 min at RT. Discard the flowthrough.Repeat adding 400 μl of 99.5% ethanol and centrifuge the plate at 1,300 × g for 4 min at RT. Discard the flowthrough.Add 700 μl of 80% ethanol to the plate and centrifuge at 1,300 × g for 10 min at RT. Discard the flowthrough.Elute the RNA by adding 30 μl of nuclease-free water to the center of each well followed by incubation for 1 min at RT. Then, centrifuge at 1,300 × g for 4 min at RT. RNA solution can be stored at -80°C.Determination of the RNA concentrationDetermine RNA concentration with the QuantiFluor RNA System kit and Quantus Fluorometer according to the manufacturer’s manual. Typical results are shown in Note 1.Note: The expected RNA concentration from an individual is too low to be measured with a spectrophotometer (e.g., NanoDrop). RNA quality checkWe recommend checking the quality of RNA through agarose gel electrophoresis or with the Bioanalyzer for some but not all samples because the amounts of RNA are low in some cases.Agarose gel electrophoresisAdd 15 μl (300 ng/lane) of the RNA sample into a well of 1% agarose gel.Run electrophoresis at 135 V for 25 min in 0.5× TBE. Typical results are shown in Note 2.",
    "BioanalyzerThis procedure requires the use of the Bioanalyzer.Check the RNA quality with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and the Agilent RNA 6000 Pico kit according to the manufacturer’s manual. Typical results are shown in Note 3."
