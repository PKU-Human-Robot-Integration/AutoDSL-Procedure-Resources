    "1. Preparation of Instruments, Stimuli Solutions, and Bed Bugs\nPrepare a 50% KNO2 solution (w/v) in a 20 ml bottle.\nSharpen two tungsten microelectrodes in KNO2 solution at 5 V by repeatedly dipping the tungsten electrodes in and out of the solution.\n\t\nRoughly sharpen the tungsten wire by dipping about 10 mm of the tungsten wire in and out of the KNO2 solution at the speed of 2 dips/sec for about 5 min, which can greatly consume the front end of the tungsten wire.\nDelicately sharpen the electrode by dipping about 1 mm of the wire tip in and out of the solution at the speed of 2 dips/sec for at least 1 min so as to make a fine and sharp point of the electrode. Check the electrode tip diameter under the microscope frequently until it reaches 0.2-0.5 µm, which should be fine enough to puncture the cuticle of bed bug olfactory sensillum.\n\t\tNote: While manually sharpening the electrode, the dipping speed of the tungsten wire into the KNO2 solution is not constant all the time. With more practice, it is much easier to keep a relatively constant speed in sharpening the electrode. The sharpening time is also uncertain depending on how fine the electrode should be. Here, an electrode tip with the diameter of ~0.2 µm is sufficient enough to puncture through the olfactory sensillum.\nDilute each of the chemical stimuli in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) from the neat compound to an initial concentration of 1:10 v/v as a stock solution. Create a series of decadic dilutions depending on how many doses required in the experiment, again with DMSO, from each of the stock solutions for each chemical. Here, use 10% (+)-β-pinene and eucalyptol.",
    "Place the unfed or seven days post-feeding adult bed bugs (either male or female) from the Ft. Dix colony (a gift from Dr. Haynes in University of Kentucky) to be used in the experiment in a petri dish.\n\tNote: There is no exact number for bed bugs placed in the Petri dish. It can be a few or a lot.\n2. Bed Bug Antennae Preparation\nAnaesthetize the bed bugs on ice (2-3 min).\nFix both the antennae and insect body on a microscope coverslip with double-sided tape and remove the legs with fine scissors.\nUse a small pin to gently touch the antennae so as to stick them on the tape steadily.\nRest the coverslip against a small ball (~1 cm diameter) of dental wax to facilitate manipulation and adjust it to an appropriate angle (~ 90°) for the recording electrode (Figure 1).\nOnce secured, place the bed bug under a stereo microscope, turn on the cold light source and adjust the intensity of illumination until the antenna is clearly presented, and focus the microscope on the second flagellum of the bed bug antenna at high magnification (720X).\n\tNote: The intensity of illumination used in the experiment is not quantitated, which really depends on how the experimenter's eyes feel the intensity of illumination.\n3. Single Sensillum Recording\nConnect the preamplifier (10X) with the signal acquisition controller, which is connected with the computer for signal recording and visualization. Turn on the computer and launch the software, e.g., AutoSpike32 and click the \"Record\" mode from the menu bar. Then choose the \"wave\" so as to start recording the wave signals.",
    "Note: A flat line running from the left to the right of the monitor repeatedly should now be visible. Here, the recording window lasts 40 sec. Max wave recording is 10 sec. Selected sampling rate is 96000 and digital sampling rate is 240. There is 0% offset and no filtering, no rectification for the recording signals. All these parameter settings in the software can be modified as needed.\nTurn on the speaker connected to the preamplifier, which is used to present the toning mode for the neuronal responses from antennal sensillum.\nInsert the reference electrode into the abdomen of the stabilized bed bug.\n\tNote: The reference electrode was held by a metal stand magnetically attached to the air-table.\nAfter the reference electrode has been connected to the bed bug's abdomen, move the recording electrode, which is connected to the preamplifier and manipulated by a micromanipulator, towards the posterior end of the bed bug's antenna.\nWhen the recording electrode is in contact with the right tip of the antenna, switch on the microscope and locate the electrode at low magnification.\nAdjust the recording electrode while gradually increasing the magnification until both the electrode and the antennal sensillum are in the same plane and clearly visible under the microscope.\n\tNote: By this time, the microscope is usually at the highest magnification.\nInsert the recording electrode into the shaft of the sensillum using the micromanipulator and go a little deeper if the background noise is high compared to the action potential.\nOnce clear action potentials are observed from the recorded sensillum, fill a micropipette with 10% (+)-β-pinene. Use the micropipette to deposit 10 µl aliquot of 10% (+)-β-pinene onto a filter paper strip (~3 x 15 mm) placed inside a glass Pasteur pipette.",
    "Connect the loaded pipette to the outlet of the pulse flow tube of the stimulus controller and place the tip of the pipette into the small hole in the tube oriented towards the antenna.\nWhen all these connections have stabilized, depress the footswitch of the stimulus controller to deliver a 0.5 sec puff of stimulus (0.5 L/min) into the continuous humidified air stream. The recording of action potentials will be initiated simultaneously when the footswitch is depressed. The recording process will be last for 10 sec starting 1 sec before the stimulation.\nCount the action potentials off-line for two 500 msec periods, one before and one after the stimulation. Subtract any change in the spike rate during the 500 msec post-stimulation from the spontaneous activity recorded during the preceding 500 msec and convert the counts into the conventional scale of spikes/s by multiplying them by 2.\n4. Stimulus Replacement in the SSR\nOnce the footswitch has been triggered, deliver the 10% (+)-β-pinene in the pipette onto the bed bug antennae and record the response to this specific odorant for 10 sec, after which the pipette is removed.\nLabel another new pipette with the 0.001% eucalyptol to be tested. Place a small piece of filter paper onto which 10 µl of the stimulus has been applied, into the new pipette.\nWait for 2-5 min until the stimulus is completely vaporized in the glass pipette. Attach the pipette onto the outlet of the pulse flow tube.\nInsert the pipette tip into the small hole of the tube oriented towards the antenna. Depress the footswitch and start the 10 sec recording.\nDisconnect the pipette and prepare another pipette with 0.01% eucalyptol.",
    "Test all the rest of the doses of eucalyptol (from 0.001% to 10%) on the antennal sensilla to observe the dose-dependent responses. Test from the most dilute to the least dilute doses.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
