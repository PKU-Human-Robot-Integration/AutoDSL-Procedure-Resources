    "Samples of human subcutaneous fat were obtained from patients undergoing surgery in the Departments of Plastic Surgery, Urology, Pediatric Surgery and Orthopedic Surgery of Nihon University Itabashi Hospital (Tokyo, Japan). The patients gave written informed consent, and the Ethics Committee of Nihon University School of Medicine approved the study.\n1. Tissue Preparation\nBring the tissue sample from the operating room to the laboratory.\nWash 1-2 g of adipose tissue with 5 ml of PBS(-) at room temperature (RT) once, in a 50 ml tube and then place the sample in a 10 cm plastic dish.\n2. Collagenase Digestion\nRemove the sample from the PBS(-), then add 10 ml of sterile 0.1% (w/v) collagenase solution (Collagenase type II) to the dish containing the tissue sample.\nMince the tissue with surgical scissors for approximately 15 min, until it reaches a pureed consistency.\nSubsequently, digest the minced tissue in the 0.1% (w/v) collagenase solution at 37 °C for 30 min (60 rpm) in a 50 ml tube with gentle agitation on a shaker.\nFilter the digested sample through a 100 µm filter into a 50 ml tube. Next, pass 10 ml of DCM (see Table of Materials) supplemented with 2% FBS through the filter.\n3. Cell Isolation\nCentrifuge the filtered cells at 100 x g for 1 min at RT.\nAt this point, prepare 5 ml of DCM supplemented with 2% FBS in a 50 ml tube.\nNext, draw up the floating fat cells using a 1,000 µl pipette and add the cells to a 50 ml tube containing medium.\nSubsequently, shake the 50 ml tube gently to mix the DCM medium with the cells.\nThen, centrifuge the tube at 100 x g for 1 min at RT.",
    "Discard the medium at the bottom of the tube using an 18 G needle and a 20 ml syringe.\nNext, add 10 ml of DCM supplemented with 2% FBS to the collected cells.\nMix the DCM with the cells by shaking the 50 ml tube gently.\nCentrifuge the tube at 100 x g for 1 min at RT.\n4. Plating Cells\nAdd 41 ml of DCM or DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS to a 12.5 cm flask.\nNext, using a 200 µl pipette add 40 µl of fat cells to the flask.\nThen, fill up the flask with DCM or DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS. CRITICAL STEP: At this point, ensure that the cells are spread throughout the medium. Visually check the detached cells and afterwards keep the flask on the lid of a round petri dish to keep it flat.\nFinally, place the flask inside the incubator and leave it undisturbed in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 7 days.\nFollowing a week of incubation, invert the flask and check for DFAT cells. Next, assess DFAT cell generation proficiency as described10 since at this point fibroblast-like cells (DFAT cells) are located in regions distinct from fat cells.\nAdd 5 ml of DCM or DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS to the flask following removal of the previous cell culture medium. Allow the DFAT cells to grow for another week after changing the medium.\nUsing a cell counter, count the number of DFAT cells generated under various cell culture conditions (DCM vs. DMEM).\nSubscription Required.
