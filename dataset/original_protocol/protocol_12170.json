    "All procedures involving the use of animals were performed with authorization of the Animal Care and Use Committee of Indiana University School of Medicine. Ensure to adhere to the legislation on animal experimentation of the country where the work is performed.\n1. Preparation of Mx1CreRBPJ-/- Recipient Mice\nCross Mx1-Cre+ mice with RBPJlox/lox mice10 to obtain Mx1-Cre positive RBPJlox/lox mice12 and Mx1-Cre negative RBPJlox/lox littermates to use as controls. Verify the genotype by PCR10.\nUse 6-8 week-old Mx1Cre+/RBPJlox/lox and Mx1Cre-/RBPJlox/lox mice to perform the polyI:C induction.\nInject polyI:C 200 µg i.p. in Cre+ and Cre- mice. Give one polyI:C injection every other day for 3 days the first week. Give one polyI:C injection the second week, 7 days after the previous injection (four injections in total).\nUse RBPJKO (induced Mx1Cre+/RBPJlox/lox) and RBPJWT (induced Mx1Cre-/RBPJlox/lox) mice as recipients 3 weeks after the last polyI:C injection.\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to use mice induced by pI:pC 3 weeks after injection. The IFNα response triggered by polyI:C induces significant changes in the BM, resulting in the immunophenotypic expansion of HSC and decreased output of mature progenitors into the peripheral blood16,17. Representation of the hematopoietic subsets is normalized 3 weeks after injection and the mice can be utilized without the confounding effects of inflammation. This induction protocol has been optimized for RBPJ. If deleting a different gene, the induction protocol may vary depending on the construct, and deletion must be validated. We validated ~100% deletion of the RBPJ region between loxP sites by RT-PCR after a total of four polyI:C injections.\n2. Preparation of Lys-EGFP Donor Bone Marrow Cells for Transplantation\nEuthanize one Lys-EGFP mouse (Carbon dioxide followed by cervical dislocation) 1 or 2 h before the transplant.\nSpray the animal body surface with 70% ethanol.",
    "Use surgical scissors to make a skin incision on both legs around the ankle and with surgical forceps pull away skin and fur together to expose clean muscle tissue.\nUse surgical scissors to remove as much muscle from the legs as possible. Using a scissors, cut the bones (at the knee and ankle joint) and clean any remaining muscle tissue from the femurs and tibias using gauze sponges. Place the bones (two femurs and two tibias) into a 6-well plate containing DMEM 10% FBS.\nCrush the bones in a mortar with 10 mL cold 2mM EDTA PBS and pipet the bone marrow cells to bring the cells into single-cell suspension. Alternatively, flush the bones with 2 mM EDTA PBS 3 times from each side with a 1 mL syringe.\nFilter the bone marrow cells by using a 70-µm filter into a 15 mL centrifuge tube. Rinse filter with 2-3 mL of PBS. Spin the cells down 10 min at 460 x g, resuspend the cells in 10 mL of fresh DMEM 10% FBS.\nCount bone marrow cells on a hemocytometer and adjust the concentration to 1.5 x 107 cells/mL in IMDM without serum. Use 3 x 106 cells per animal with a volume of 200 µL. About 1/3 cells of total BM are myeloid GFP+ cells. Leave the cells on ice until ready for injection. Use 0.5 x 105 cells to determine GFP expression by FACS9.\n3. Bone Marrow Transplantation of Lys-GFP Cells into RBPJKO Mice\nRestrain recipient mice in a pie cage. Irradiate mice with a lethal dose of gamma radiation (1,200 Rad) on a Cs 137 irradiator. Use a split dose protocol: 900 rads in the evening followed by 300 rads the next morning (16 h apart).",
    "Transplant the lethally irradiated RBPJWT and RBPJKO recipient mice 5-6 h after the second dose of radiation. Inject BM cells harvested from Lys-EGFP mice at a concentration of 3 x 106 cells per animal via tail vein injection (See details for harvesting cells in section 2).\nImage independent cohorts of transplanted mice by IVFM at different time points: 24 h, and at weeks 2, 4 and 6, as described below (See section 4 & 5 for in vivo imaging procedure).\n4. Surgical Preparation for Intravital Imaging\nSterilize surgical instruments. Two fine forceps (one straight, one angled), one pair of fine scissors and one pair of needle holders. Prepare operative area with all supplies needed for procedure.\nGive the mouse an IP injection of ketamine cocktail anesthetic (Xylazine 2.5-5 mg/kg + acepromazine 1.0-2.5 mg/kg + ketamine 90-100 mg/kg) using a 26-28 G needle syringe.  Animal will be monitored every 15 min during the procedure and anesthetic will be supplemented as necessary at ¼ of the original dose.\nPlace the mouse on a proper heat source (37 °C heating pad, animal protected from direct contact with heating pad) and visually monitor the respiratory rate.\nCheck reflexes using the toe pinch response. Ensure that the animal is completely under anesthesia before beginning any surgical procedures.\nUse a 26-28 gauge needle syringe to give mice a tail vein injection of a fluorescent vascular marker (Dextran, 100 μL of 20 mg/mL solution).\nApply vet eye ointment to both eyes. Clip the dorsal surface of the animal's head with small electric clippers. Apply a hair removal cream for 5 min. Use gauze sponges to remove the cream and then rinse with saline. Prep the clean scalp with 70% alcohol using a cotton swab.",
    "Use fine forceps and scissor to make a small midline skin incision (10-20 mm) on the scalp to expose the underlying dorsal skull surface. Use 5-0 surgical silk to place two stay sutures in the skin on each side of the incision, creating a flap to expose the calvarium for imaging.\nPosition the mice on their back and submerge the exposed scalp in a glass bottom dish filled with microscope oil. Transport the animal to the mutiphoton imaging room.\nPlace the animal on the microscope stage with the calvarium positioned on the glass dish above the objective and then cover with a 37 °C heating pad (animal must be protected from direct contact with heat).\n5. In Vivo High Resolution Imaging of the Mouse Calvarium\nUse an inverted confocal system modified for multiphoton imaging (see Materials Table). Following manufacturer's instructions tune a 2-photon laser to 830 nm, place a 20X W, NA 0.95 objective lens in the microscope nose piece and check the laser beam alignment.\n\tNOTE: Upright microscope systems are most commonly used for these studies, but an inverted multiphoton system may also be utilized. In this study, a custom designed atraumatic stereotaxic device was used. Although there are several commercially available stereotaxic devices for upright microscope systems, there is no commercially available stereotaxic device for an inverted microscope system aimed at securing the mouse skull. As alternative to a custom stereotaxic device, the skull can be secured in position above the objective utilizing various tape or glue methods for stability.",
    "Open an image acquisition software. In the \"Acquisition Settings\" panel check if one directional scanning mode is selected. Set up the speed of scanning to 4 μs/pixel, frame rate to 512 x 512 pixels and zoom to 1.5. Select 20X W Na 0.95 objective from the list of available objective lenses to match the lens positioned in the nosepiece.\nAccess the \"Dye List\" from the \"Image Acquisition Control\" panel and select \"Two Photon\". Open the \"Light Path & Dyes\" window and select DM690-980 excitation DM. Open the 2P laser shutter by checking the check box in the Laser Unit 2. In the \" Microscope Controller\" window, select RDM690 mirror.\nSelect \" EPI LAMP\", choose B/G epi-filter cube and focus the objective onto the specimen to visualize vascular flow and the calvarium bone marrow niche, using as reference the bifurcation of the central vein (a) and the coronary suture (b) (Figure 2A).\nCollect images using non-descanned mode. Select three external detectors: PMT detector1 to collect SHG signal of collagen (emission filter - 430/100 nm), GaAsP detector2 to collect GFP signal (emission filter - 525/50) and GaAsP detector3 to collect signal of TRITC-dextran (emission filter - 605/90 nm).\nPerform imaging at a scan rate of 4μs/pixel with no averaging to minimize phototoxicity. Collect images at a constant laser power and detector gain adjusted to utilize the full dynamic range of the detector with minimal saturation.\nCollect series of sections through the depth of tissue (60 x 1 μm Z-stacks) from 6 regions of calvarium bone marrow. Use step size settings of 1 μm, zoom 1.5 and 512 x 512 pixels frame size (423 µm x 423 µm).\n\t\tNote: Overall total time required to image one mouse is 1-1.5 h.\n6. Quantitative Analysis",
    "Perform the image quantitation and 3D reconstructions using a dedicated 3D/4D image quantitation and visualization software as per manufacturer's instructions (see Materials Table). Visualize interactively Z-stacks in 3D utilizing Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP), alpha-blend or shadow projection volume rendering algorithms.\nSegment GFP cells using the \"Spot Object segmentation module\". Apply stack arithmetic processing (channel subtraction) to eliminate false positive count of GFP cells (this eliminates signal of bone cells displaying strong fluorescence in green and red channels).\nPerform segmentation of vasculature and bone surface using the Surface segmentation module. If required, calculate distances of cells to any of the above surfaces by applying X-tension algorithms called \"distance of spot to surface\".\nSubscription Required.
