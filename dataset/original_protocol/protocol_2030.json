    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPBMC thawing, cell counting, and viability staining\nTiming: 2 h\nTo prepare the cryopreserved PBMC samples for mass cytometry staining, the samples must first be thawed and counted.\nCritical: This step assumes the availability of two technicians to facilitate the quick and efficient thawing and counting of samples.\nBefore staining, annotate and fill the appropriate number of 15-mL conical tubes (one per sample) with 9 mL of warmed to 37°C RPMI +10% FBS +1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic (named Complete RPMI from now on), and prepare necessary counting slides.\nPrepare the cell surface antibody master mix in CyFACS (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1624_4.csv\nThaw the samples by placing the rack with 10 frozen vials directly into the 37°C circulating water bath until content is thawed, approximately 45 s, few small ice crystals might remain in the vial.\nImmediately transfer the totality of thawed cell suspensions into the 15 mL conical tubes containing 9 mL of 37°C complete RPMI.\nRepeat step 3 and 4 for remaining batches of frozen vials.\nFilter the samples using 70 μM cell pre-wetted strainers to obtain a single cell suspension.\nCount cells using AO/PI (1:1 dilution; 20 μL sample in 20 μL AO/PI) with the Cellometer® Auto 2000 Cell Viability Counter (or alternative cell counter).\nGently invert the conical tube containing the freshly thawed cells to ensure cells are fully resuspended.\nAdd 20 μL of the AO/PI-diluted sample to a Cellometer® SD100 Cell Counting Chamber.\nCells should be >90% viable.\nAccording to the cell count, adjust volume of cell suspension to a final concentration of 3 × 106 cells per condition in complete RPMI.\nNote: To prepare samples for staining, prepare a total of 3 × 106 cells for each condition. If more cells will be stained, this will require careful titration of antibodies.",
    "Centrifuge samples (400 g, 5 min, RT).\nWhile the samples are spinning down, prepare the 103Rh Viability Stain (1:500 dilution of 103Rh Cell-IDTM Intercalator-Rh in 37°C warm complete RPMI).\nAfter the sample is spun down, carefully aspirate and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the sample in 1 mL of warm, Complete RPMI+103Rh Viability Stain.\nIncubate the samples for 15 min at room temperature (17°C–25°C).\nDuring incubation, aliquot 50 μL of surface stain antibody cocktail per well into designated v-bottomed wells of the 96-well polystyrene plate.\nOnce incubation is complete, fill conical tube up to 10 mL with complete RPMI and spin down (400 g, 5 min, RT).\nCarefully aspirate and discard supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet.\nResuspend each cell pellet in 50 μL CyFACS and proceed to Fc-block and surface staining[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2].\nOptional: The cell surface antibody master mix can be prepared during the viability stain incubation, but we recommend preparing the cocktail prior to the thawing of samples.\nFc-block and surface staining\nTiming: 1 h\nThis portion of the protocol stains the sample with pre-selected metal-tagged antibodies to be acquired and used in downstream analysis. Prior to antibody staining, the samples are Fc-blocked to prevent non-specific staining of antibodies.\nFc-block:\nAdd 5 μL undiluted Fc-block to each sample.\nIncubate the samples on ice for 10 min.\nOnce the incubation is complete, distribute the totality of Fc-blocked samples into the appropriate wells (already containing the antibody cocktail) according to the plate map.\nIncubate the staining plate for 30 min at room temperature.\nDuring incubation, prepare the eBioScienceTM FoxP3 Fixation/Permeabilization Buffer as per manufacturer protocol (www.thermofisher.com[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/references/protocols/cell-and-tissue-analysis/protocols/staining-intracellular-antigens-flow-cytometry.html]) (briefly, mix 1 part fix/perm concentrate (00-5123-43) + 3 parts fix/perm diluent (00-5223-56)).\nDuring incubation, prepare the eBioScienceTM Perm/Wash solution by diluting 5 mL of 10× Permeabilization Buffer stock into 45 mL of Ultra-Pure H20.",
    "After incubation is complete, centrifuge the plate to pellet cells (400 g, 5 min, RT).\nCarefully aspirate and discard supernatant from each staining well using the multi-channel pipette, set for approximately 20 μL less than the volume in the well to avoid aspirating the pellet. For best results, tilt the plate at a 45° angle and rest the pipette tip on the edge of the well, right before the well funnels down into the v-bottom. This applies for every aspiration step in this protocol.\nAdd 200 μL CyFACs/well using multichannel pipette and centrifuge the plate (400 g, 5 min, RT).\nOptional: The surface antibody master mix can be added individually to each sample well after the Fc-blocked cells have been plated, but this increases risk of technical error and experimental time.\nNote: The FoxP3 Fixation/Permeabilization Buffer is prepared in excess and will be needed for the DNA stain at the end of the protocol.\nPermeabilization and intracellular staining\nTiming: 1.5 h\nThis portion of the protocol describes staining the samples with pre-selected metal-tagged antibodies that target intracellular markers.\nCarefully aspirate and discard supernatant from each staining well using multichannel pipette (as in step 20).\nResuspend samples thoroughly in 200 μL of FoxP3 Fixation/Permeabilization Buffer per well, using multichannel pipette.\nIncubate the plate for 30 min at room temperature.\nDuring incubation, prepare the intracellular antibody master mix (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1624_5.csv\nCritical: Intracellular antibody master mix is made in Perm/Wash.\nCentrifuge plate (800 g, 5 min, RT) and wash samples once with 200 μL of Perm/Wash per well using multichannel pipette.\nCarefully aspirate and discard supernatant (as in step 20).\nResuspend each sample in 50 μL of Perm/Wash per well using multichannel pipette.\nAdd 50 μL of intracellular master mix to each well.\nIncubate the plate for 30 min at room temperature.",
    "After incubation is complete, add 100 μL of Perm/Wash solution per well using multichannel pipette and centrifuge plate (800 g, 5 min, RT).\nWash samples with 200 μL of Perm/Wash solution per well using multichannel pipette, centrifuge the plate (800 g, 5 min, RT), and carefully aspirate the supernatant as in step 20.\nDuring spin, prepare fresh 4% PFA solution from 16% stock PFA in Ultra-Pure H2O.\nAdd 200 μL of freshly prepared 4% PFA per well using multichannel pipette.\nCentrifuge the plate (800 g, 10 min, RT), aspirate the supernatant (as in step 20), and proceed to barcoding.\nDuring spin, prepare the 191/193 DNA Intercalator at a 1:5,000 dilution of 191/193 Cell-IDTM Intercalator-Ir to FoxP3 Fixation/Permeabilization Buffer.\nDuring spin, prepare Barcode Perm Buffer according to manufacturer’s protocol (www.fluidigm.com[href=https://assets.fluidigm.com/asset/692]) by diluting 1 part 10× Barcode Perm Buffer in 9 parts PBS.\nCritical: Spin time was increased to 10 min to improve cell recovery post-fixation of cells.\nPalladium-based barcoding\nTiming: 45 min\nThis portion of the protocol applies a post stain 6-choose-3 palladium based barcoding system to mitigate potential procedural variations while retaining staining efficiency. We applied a post-stain barcoding scheme to preserve fixation sensitive staining while maintaining the acquisition consistency of running pooled samples. This Palladium-based Barcoding Strategy is adapted from the protocol “Cell-ID 20-Plex Pd Barcoding Kit” on www.fluidigm.com[href=https://assets.fluidigm.com/asset/692].\nRemove barcode tubes from −20°C, thaw, and briefly spin down barcodes in mini centrifuge.\nResuspend barcodes in 100 μL Barcode Perm Buffer.\nResuspend freshly fixed cells from step 33 in 100 μL Barcode Perm Buffer per well using multichannel pipette.\nTransfer the totality (100 μL) of resuspended barcodes from step 35 to respective wells containing samples using multichannel pipette.\nIncubate the plate for 30 min at room temperature.",
    "Centrifuge plate (800 g, 5 min, RT) and wash samples once with 200 μL of Barcode Perm Buffer using multichannel pipette.\nResuspened each well with 200 μL of Barcode Perm Buffer using multichannel pipette and combine all samples from a single barcode batch (up to 20 samples) into a 15 mL conical tube.\nWash once with 5 mL Barcode Perm Buffer, pellet the cells by centrifugation (800 g, 5 min, RT), and proceed to DNA staining.\nOptional: We recommend including a healthy donor sample in each barcoding batch (i.e., 19 clinical samples, one healthy donor sample). If running multiple full barcodes, the same normal donor should be used throughout batches to assess data quality.\nOptional: If running a smaller cohort of patients (less than 20 samples), barcoding may be omitted. In this case, proceed from step 33 to step 42 and adjust all the buffer/wash volumes to 200 μL/well. Samples can be frozen directly in plate: using multichannel pipette add 100 μL of freezing medium per well to the spun-down cells from step 47.\nDNA staining and plate freezing\nTiming: 1 h\nThe final steps stain the cell nuclei to allow for single-cell detection and discrimination by the HeliosTM mass cytometer. After completing the DNA stain, the samples are prepared for short-term storage until acquisition. Prior to acquisition the samples are thawed and prepared accordingly for optimal HeliosTM acquisition.\nPer full barcode (20 samples) add 5 mL of a 1:5,000 dilution of 191/193 DNA Intercalator in FoxP3 Fixation/Permeabilization Buffer.\nIncubate samples 1 h at 4°C.\nPause point: Samples can be incubated in 191/193 DNA Intercalator staining solution up to 16 h (or overnight) at 4°C instead of 1 h incubation.\nAfter the incubation is complete, pellet cells by plate centrifugation (800 g, 5 min, RT).\nCarefully aspirate and discard supernatant.",
    "Wash once with 2 mL of Cell Staining Buffer.\nCentrifuge the tube(s) (800 g, 5 min, RT) and carefully aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet(s) in 500 μL of freezing media (85% FBS, 15% DMSO) and immediately transfer to −20°C for storage.\nCritical: This protocol was optimized and validated for short-term storage of stained and frozen samples (up to 1 month).\nPre-acquisition thawing and wash\nTiming: 45 min\nOn the acquisition day, thaw samples with 500 μL of warm Complete RPMI per tube(s) (100 μL per well if no barcoding was applied).\nCentrifuge the thawed samples (800 g, 5 min, RT).\nWash once with 2 mL of Cell Acquisition Solution (CAS).\nCount the total number of cells with Cellometer® Auto 2000 Cell Viability Counter, and pellet cells by centrifugation (800 g, 5 min).\nLoad 20 μL of sample directly into Cellometer® SD100 Cell Counting Chamber to count total cell concentration (in absence of stain).\nCount the cells using the Cellometer® Auto 2000 Cell Viability Counter during spin and record final cell count.\nPrepare a 1:5 dilution of MaxPar EQ Calibration beads in CAS (CAS/EQ).\nCritical: Vortex the EQ Calibration beads for 1 min before preparing EQ beads/CAS solution.\nResuspend the samples at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells per 1 mL in EQ beads/CAS solution.\nFilter resuspended sample through a 35 μm pre-wetted cell strainer cap into a labeled, polypropylene tube in 2 mL aliquots.\nProceed to HeliosTM mass cytometer acquisition (Fluidigm)."
