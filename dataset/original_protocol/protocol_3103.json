Warm the tube in the water bath.",
    "Once the tube is warmed, add 5 μL of fresh RANKL solution (100 μg/mL) and 1.25 μL of fresh MCSF solution (100 μg/mL) to obtain final concentrations of 100 ng/mL RANKL and 25 ng/mL MCSF.\nAfter 24 h of cell incubation at 37°C and 5% CO2 with supplemented RPMI-1640 medium (with 10% autologous plasma and 50 μg/mL gentamycin), carefully discard the supernatant with a 1 mL pipette.\nWash the wells carefully with dPBS without calcium and magnesium ions.\nAdd 1 mL of fresh α-MEM differentiation medium with the addition of RANKL and MCSF to every well.\nObserve the cells under the light microscope. The confluency should not exceed 60% of the well.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nObserve the cells under the light microscope every 24 h for signs of monocyte differentiation.\nCulture the cells for 14–21 days, exchanging the medium every 3–4 days (points 7–11).\nCritical: Add fresh MCSF and RANKL to the media before media exchange.\nOn Day 13, perform TRAP staining (according to the protocol below) and terminate differentiation once osteoclasts are observed.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2877-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Timeline from monocyte differentiation to osteoclast observation using MCSF and RANKL protein\nCreated with BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com].\nNote: Osteoclasts can be observed as multilobular cells containing at least 4 nuclei (see the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section, problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nTRAP staining using an acid phosphatase leukocyte kit\nTiming: 2 h",
    "TRAP staining using acid phosphatase is a fundamental technique for the visualization and quantification of osteoclasts. The kit allows for the colorimetric detection of cells by allowing the detection of acid phosphatase in blood leukocytes. This is achieved by subjectively evaluating the absence or presence of tartrate-resistant enzyme. Most leukocytes demonstrate granular sites of activity in the absence of tartaric acid. However, when incubated with tartrate, occasional granules may be observed in lymphocytes and specialized macrophages. Therefore, the TRAP staining kit allows us to detect osteoclasts differentiated from PBMCs, and performing this procedure is a crucial step before the visualization of cathepsin K.\nPrewarm 20 mL of deionized water at 37°C.\nPrepare two 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes, add 0.5 mL fast garnet GBC base solution and 0.5 mL sodium nitrite solution.\nMix by inversion for 30 s and let stand for 2 min.\nIn a 15 mL centrifuge tube, prepare fixative solution by combining 2.5 mL citrate solution, 6.5 mL acetone and 0.8 mL 37% formaldehyde (total volume: 9.8 mL).\nLabel a 50 mL centrifuge tube A and add the appropriate ingredients described in the table “Acid phosphate leukocyte kit” in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section, followed by mixing.\nWarm centrifuge tube A up to 37°C and check that the temperature is correct before use.\nAllow the fixative solution reach room temperature.\nTo 1 well, add 1 mL of fixative solution, let stand for 30 s, then discard the supernatant and rinse the well with deionized water.\nDo not allow the slide to dry.\nAdd 1 mL of solution from centrifuge tube A to the well and incubate for 1 h at 37°C, protecting the slide from light.",
    "After 1 h, rinse the slides with deionized water and counterstain with 1 mL of hematoxylin solution, Gill no. 3, for 2 min.\nRemove the supernatant and rinse the wells several times with 1 mL of tap water to remove excess counterstain.\nThe tap water used for rinsing should reveal the blue nuclei of the osteoclast cells.\nAllow the wells to dry and evaluate under a microscope.\nOnce you can see the osteoclasts after approximately 14 days of culture, you can proceed with confocal slide preparation.\nVisualization of active CatK in osteoclasts\nTiming: 3 days\nActivity-based probes allow the detection of the active form of an enzyme. With this procedure, active cathepsin K in osteoclasts is visualized. To date, most methods for detecting CatK are limited, as they allow the detection and confirmation of only the presence or absence of a protein. Activity-based probes bind only to the active form of the enzyme. Together with the use of antibodies, not only the presence of the enzyme but also its activity can be detected.\nDay 1: 3 h\nDepending on the aims of your experiment, treat osteoclasts with inducers or inhibitors.\nIn this protocol, proteases are inhibited. To induce protease inhibition, the differentiated osteoclasts must be incubated with the selected inhibitors.\nWith the selected inhibitors, incubate the samples overnight. The incubation time can be changed depending on inhibitor potency.\nIn this protocol, to fresh α-MEM differentiation medium (with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin‒streptomycin), inhibitors including TJK16i, E64d, and CA-074Me at a final concentration of 10 μM are added to separate portions of medium (separate centrifuge tubes, one for each inhibitor).\nMix the medium well before adding to the cells to make sure the medium is thoroughly mixed.\nAdd 1 mL of medium with the appropriate inhibitor.",
    "For control samples in which no inhibitor is added, add the same volume of medium.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 24 h to ensure that the inhibitors penetrate the cell membrane and inhibit the target proteases.\nDay 2\nThe next day, prepare a solution of qTJK16 in medium.\nAdd 5 μL of qTJK16 (with an initial concentration of 100 μM) to 995 μL of α-MEM differentiation medium (with 10% FBS and 100 U/mL penicillin‒streptomycin).\nNote: The final concentration of qTJK16 is 500 nM.\nRemove the chamber from the previous day from incubator, discard the supernatant and wash chamber wells as described above.\nAdd the medium with the activity-based probe prepared at point 1 to the appropriate wells.\nNote: For unstained control samples, use the medium without the probe.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 1 h.\nDiscard the supernatant by pouring very slowly and wash the cells with dPBS without calcium and magnesium ions.\nNext, add 1 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde solution to each well and incubate the cells for 10 min at room temperature.\nDiscard the supernatant as described above.\nBlock the stained cells using the blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature, then wash the cells with 3 × 1 mL portions of dPBS.\nThis needs to be done slowly to prevent the detachment of cells. Perform all work using a serological pipette and pump.\nPermeabilize the cell membrane by adding 1 mL of 0.1% (w/v) saponin solution in dPBS to each well and incubating the cells for 30 min at room temperature.\nDuring this time, prepare the antibody solution.\nAdd 1:1000 of primary anti-CatK antibody in antibody buffer solution and mix gently.\nStore on ice for further experimentation.",
    "Discard the supernatant and add 1 mL of antibody solution per well. Incubate the cells overnight at 4°C.\nDay 3: 4 h\nBefore you start, select the secondary antibody for your experiment.\nIt is recommended to use secondary antibody conjugated with fluorophore.\nCritical: Fluorophores with good stability, high brightness and low photobleaching must be selected. For this protocol, AF488 was selected, but other secondary antibodies can be selected depending on the available equipment; however, it is crucial to apply an antibody that has no signal overlap with Cy5.\nDilute the secondary antibody to 1:1000 with antibody buffer.\nDiscard the supernatant from each well and wash the wells with dPBS.\nAdd 1 mL of solution of secondary antibody (prepared in point 2) per well and incubate the cells at room temperature for 1 h.\nAt the same time, prepare an adequate volume of Hoechst 33342 (1:1000, according to the manufacturer’s instructions) in dPBS and stored for no longer than 10 min at room temperature.\nAfter 1 h of incubation, discard the secondary antibody from the wells, wash the cells 3–4 times (as described above) with dPBS (no calcium or magnesium ions).\nTo each well, add 1 mL of Hoechst solution and incubate cells with nuclei staining solution for 10 min at room temperature.\nRemove the supernatant and wash the wells 2 times with dPBS (no calcium or magnesium ions).\nSince we are using chambers, we first need to dissemble the device from the slide.\nRemove the cover of the plate and carefully remove the plastic that forms the walls of the plate. It is attached on silicone rubber, which is visible on the bottom of the slide once the plastic body is removed.",
    "Using tweezers, grab the rubber at one of the corners and pull slowly, and a template of four rectangles will appear on the slide. This allows us to distinguish the wells from each other.\nNext, using a Kim wipe, try to remove the excess supernatant left of the slide by gently moving the piece of tissue to the edge of the slide.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2877-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Schematic representation of slide preparation and removal of the plastic chamber revealing the slide\nCreated with BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com].\nNote: Do not directly touch the slide with the paper as you will remove the cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Please note that other chambers or cover slips can be used.\nTo every rectangle on the slide (the bottom of the chamber; Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) add 3 drops of Fluoromount™ Aqueous Mounting Medium.\nGently, using tweezers, add one rectangular coverslip on top of the slide to cover all the wells, starting at one end and slowly dropping the rest of the glass and preventing the formation of air bubbles.\nMake sure the whole surface is covered in mounting medium; otherwise, dry spots will form on the slide, preventing visualization.\nNote: Do not squeeze the coverslip and the slide!\nAllow the slides to dry in the dark for 30–60 min. Next, seal the edges of the cover glass using clear nail polish.\nNote: This will prevent the cover glass from moving and prevent air from getting in between the coverslip and the glass.\nLeave the slides to dry for 1 h, protected from sunlight. Until the slides are visualized, store them at 4°C.\nVisualize active CatK in osteoclasts, anti-CatK and nuclei using a confocal microscope with 405 nm (nucleus), 488 nm (antibody), and 632 nm (qTJK16) lasers.",
    "We imaged our samples with a Leica DMi8 confocal microscope under a 63 × oil immersion objective (HC PL APO CS2 63×/1.40 OIL).\nFor Z-stack analysis, we set up a step of 0.5–1 microns. A 405 nm laser was set for 0.01%, a 488 nm laser was set for 3.1%, and a 638 nm laser was set for 0.1%.\nNote: However, all the settings should be determined individually, as they depend on the available equipment and anticipated outcome. We recommend setting up laser power and gain to reduce overexposure of the fluorescence signal on the first slide containing osteoclasts, qTJK16 and anti-CatK or the slide for which the highest fluorescence is expected.\nNext, analyze the control slide without staining to ensure that the observed fluorescent signal is not autofluorescence (see the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section, problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nContinue analysis of all slides.\nTo compare enzyme activity, analyze all the slides with the same parameters.\nNote: If possible, do this on the same day, making sure you have all controls. Make z-stacks to observe the exact localization of the enzyme and facilitate 3D image generation (see the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section, problems 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).\nData analysis\nTiming: 1–2 days",
    "The analysis of confocal microscopy images involves the analysis of the morphological features of cells and data quantification. In this procedure, to quantify the overlay of the probe with the antibody and therefore quantify the proportion between the active enzyme and its total amount in the region of interest, it is recommended to analyze colocalization. The fluorescence signal overlap from the antibody and probe can be utilized to determine the proportion of active enzyme to its total amount. Normally, to quantify colocalization, Pearson’s correlation coefficient is calculated. To determine the differences in CatK activity under different experimental conditions (i.e., inhibitors), it is recommended to compare the intensity of fluorescence.\nDegree of colocalization between active and total protein amounts in cells\nCalculate the Pearson’s correlation coefficient for the qTJK16 probe and anti-CatK.\nNote: You may find a preset tool for colocalization analysis in your program for confocal microscopy (i.e., LasX 3.5.2.18963), or you can perform the analysis with free programs, such as ImageJ®.\nAnalyze at least 10 cells and compare results of imaging from different analyses (i.e., induced, treated with inhibitors).\nCompare the results by using GraphPad Prism®, MS Excel®, or similar programs.\nMorphological features\nOpen images with the available program for images analysis (i.e., LasX®, ImageJ®).\nObserve the location of active cathepsin K by visually observing single images.\nNote: If bright spots are observed, you may assume localization in the lysosome. If the signal is weaker and dispersed, you may assume active CatK is present in the cytoplasm.\nUse z-stacks to generate a 3D image of an osteoclast.\nNote: You may use the automatic functions of programs for image capturing and analysis (i.e., LasX®), or you can generate the image with other programs, i.e., free ImageJ®.",
    "By analyzing the 3D image of the cell, you may evaluate the localization of CatK in the entire cell, not only in a single stack.\nDifferences in CatK activity between samples\nTo observe differences in CatK activity between individual samples, i.e., osteoclasts and osteoclasts treated with CatK inhibitor, it is recommended to measure the intensity of fluorescence of individual samples.\nAnalyze the fluorescence signal intensity of every captured cell.\nMake sure you analyze the z-stack through an entire cell, not just a part of the cell, e.g., the middle of the cell.\nNote: Especially in the case of osteoclasts, CatK is located at the ruffled borders of the cell, so inadequate analysis may cause false results, as the most crucial part of the cell could be ignored.\nCalculate the average of the highest mean intensity per cell of at least 10 cells and compare it in a diagram, e.g., a bar diagram, with the results from other analyses (i.e., inhibitor treated) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2877-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.
