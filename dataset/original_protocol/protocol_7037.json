    "Overview Day 0: Prepare peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).Day 0: Isolate CD14+ monocytes from PBMCs by positive selection.Day 0: Differentiate monocytes into dendritic cells by culturing in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4.Day 3: Replenish GM-CSF and IL-4.Day 5: Mature dendritic cells by adding TNF-α, PGE2, IL-1β, and IL-6 to the culture.Day 6: Mature dendritic cells by adding IFN-γ to the culture.Day 7: Confirm maturation of the DCs by flow cytometry and set up the suppression assay.Day11: Collect cells, stain, perform flow cytometry, and analyse.Detailed Procedure Day 0: Prepare PBMCsPrepare PBMCs: Either freshly isolated from blood or thawed PBMCs. PBMCs can be isolated from human peripheral blood by density gradient centrifugation using LymphoprepTM, according to the manufacturer’s protocol.Note: Using batch-frozen PBMCs from one donor to differentiate moDCs will reduce donor-to-donor variability. Expect 5-10% fresh/frozen PBMCs or 50-100% CD14+ cells to become moDCs. See Notes for further details. Optional: Set aside ~5 × 103-10 × 103 PBMCs for purity check (see Table 1, Figure 1, and Notes for further information).Table 1. Day 0 Purity Check Panel. Stain PBMCs in parallel, if desired.

(A) Approximately 5 × 103-10 × 103 total PBMCs and (B) CD14-enriched cells were stained and analysed by flow cytometry to evaluate the purity of the CD14-enriched cells and the extent of CD3+ cell contamination. Contaminating T cells can affect downstream results if OKT3 (anti-CD3) is included during assays (see Notes). Cells were stained as described in Table 1 and in accordance with “Guidelines for the use of flow cytometry and cell sorting in immunological studies” (Cossarizza et al., 2019); they were acquired with a BD LSRFortessa X-20 and data analysed using FlowJo. The proportion of total live cells that were CD14+CD3‒ (CD14+ cell purity) is shown on the left. From the live CD14‒ cells, CD56 expression was analysed (middle) to identify NK/NKT cells (CD56med/hi) and a subset of monocytes (CD56lo). The contaminating live CD14‒CD3+ T cells were further analysed for their expression of CD4 and CD8 (right). See Notes for more information.Day 0: Isolate CD14+ monocytes using the STEMCELL EasySep Human CD14 Positive Selection Kit II, as per the manufacturer’s protocol and described below, unless stated otherwise:Resuspend PBMCs at 100 × 106/ml in EasySep Buffer (0.1-2 ml). The total starting number of PBMCs should be between 10 × 106 and 200 × 106 cells. For x number of CD14+ monocytes, start with 10× (fresh) or ~20× (frozen) PBMCs.Transfer PBMCs to a 5 ml polystyrene round-bottom tube.Add 100 μl of Selection Cocktail per millilitre of cells and incubate 10 min at room temperature (RT).Vortex RapidSpheres for 30 s, add 100 μl of RapidSpheres per ml cells, mix tube by gentle rotation, and incubate for 3 min at RT.Top up tube with EasySep Buffer to 2.5 ml, mix by pipetting, place in an EasySepTM magnet, and incubate for 3 min at RT.",
    "Gently pour tube while in magnet to discard supernatant. The round-bottom tube contains CD14+ cells (keep).Wash remaining RapidSpheres by removing the round-bottom tube from the magnet and topping up tube with 2.5 ml of EasySep Buffer. Mix by pipetting to wash layer off tube wall, replace the tube back in the magnet, and incubate for 3 min at RT. Pour to discard supernatant and pipette last drop from tube while inverted.Repeat Step B7 so that the tube of cells is incubated in the magnet a total of three times.Optionally repeat Step B7 two more times (total of five times on magnet) for potentially higher enrichment.Note: This step is not part of the original STEMCELL Technologies protocol. Transfer the cells from the round-bottom tube into a 15 ml conical tube by washing the walls of the round-bottom tube with ~3 ml of DPBS. Centrifuge at 450 × g for 5 min and discard supernatant.Resuspend the enriched CD14+ cells in Dendritic Cell Medium (see Recipes).Count cells (see protocols from Nexcelom Cellometer Auto 2000 for details; alternatively, a hemocytometer and trypan blue can be used).Optional: set aside ~5 × 103-10 × 103 monocytes for purity check (see Table 1, Figure 1, and Notes for further information).Day 0: Culture and differentiate enriched CD14+ cells into dendritic cellsAdjust cells to 2 × 106 cells per millilitre with Dendritic Cell Medium.Plate 2 ml cells per well in a 6-well plate (4 × 106 cells per well).Note: Plate multiple wells of cells as needed. Add GM-CSF (final concentration: 50 ng/ml) and IL-4 (final concentration: 100 ng/ml).Incubate cells at 37°C (5% v/v CO2) for 3 days.Note: Cytokines can be stored at 4°C for ~1 week.",
    "Day 3: Change Dendritic Cell Medium and replenish cytokinesChange Dendritic Cell Medium: without disturbing the cells at the bottom of the well, collect 1.5 ml of medium into sterile 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, centrifuge at 450 × g for 5 min, discard the supernatant, resuspend the pelleted cells in 1.5 ml of fresh Dendritic Cell Medium, and re-plate into original well.Fully replenish the cytokines by adding fresh GM-CSF (final concentration: 50 ng/ml) and IL-4 (final concentration: 100 ng/ml), assuming that no cytokines from day 0 remain in the culture.Incubate at 37°C (5% v/v CO2) for 2 days.Note: Cytokines can be stored at 4°C for ~1 week. Alternative medium change method: Centrifuge plate at 450 × g for 5 min, gently replace 1.5 ml of Dendritic Cell Medium, and fully replenish the GM-CSF and IL-4 as detailed above. Day 5: Mature dendritic cellsCollect cells: pipette up and down to detach cells and collect either into a 15 ml or 50 ml conical tube. Detach remaining cells using a 1 ml or 3 ml syringe rubber in gentle, one-way movements. Rinse well twice with DPBS to collect as many cells as possible.Wash cells by filling the conical tube with DPBS, centrifuge cells at 450 × g for 5 min, and discard the supernatant.Resuspend cells in fresh Dendritic Cell Medium, count cells, and adjust volume so that cells are at a final concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml in Dendritic Cell Medium.Add GM-CSF (final concentration: 50 ng/ml) and IL-4 (final concentration: 100 ng/ml).Plate cells in a new well by adding 2 ml of cells per well in a new 6-well plate (2 × 106 cells per well) or 1 ml of cells per well in a new 12-well plate (1 × 106 cells per well).",
    "Mature moDCs by adding TNF-α (final concentration: 50 ng/ml), PGE2 (final concentration: 1 μg/ml, ~2.837 µM), IL-1β (final concentration: 10 ng/ml), and IL-6 (final concentration: 100 ng/ml).Note: If immature moDCs are desired, skip this step. Keeping a minimum of 1 × 106 immature moDCs (GM-CSF and IL-4 with no additional cytokines) is useful for evaluating the moDC maturation at the end (day 7, see Procedure G). Incubate at 37°C (5% v/v CO2) for 1 day.Day 6: Continue to mature dendritic cellsAdd IFN-γ (final concentration: 50 ng/ml).Note: Skip this step for immature moDCs. Incubate at 37°C (5% v/v CO2) for 1 day.Day 7: Confirm maturation of the DCs before setting up the suppression assayCollect cells by pipetting to resuspend and transfer to a 15 ml conical tube. Detach remaining cells using a 1 ml or 3 ml syringe rubber in gentle, one-way movements. Wash wells twice with DPBS and add this to the conical tube. Centrifuge cells at 450 × g for 5 min, resuspend in fresh Dendritic Cell Medium, count cells, and adjust cell concentration to 5 × 105 cells/ml in Dendritic Cell Medium.Confirm moDC maturation by collecting ~5 × 106-10 × 106 mature moDCs and immature moDCs for staining for flow cytometry (see Table 2, Figure 2).Table 2.

(A-C) Immature (black line) and mature (blue) moDCs were analysed by flow cytometry for expression of CD11c, CD14, CD80, CD86, CD40, CD83, and HLA-DR. Cells were stained as described in Table 2 and in accordance with “Guidelines for the use of flow cytometry and cell sorting in immunological studies” (Cossarizza et al., 2019); they were acquired with a BD LSRFortessa X-20 and data analysed using FlowJo. moDCs (gated as live, single cells) expressed similar levels of lineage markers (A) but upregulated expression of CD80, CD86, HLA-DR, CD40, and CD83 following maturation (B-C). MFI, geometric mean fluorescence intensity.Day 7: Set up DC suppression assayPlate 100 µl moDC in a 96-well U-bottom plate (50,000 cells per well).Collect rested Tregs, count cells, and resuspend at 2.5 × 106 cells per ml in Dendritic Cell Medium with 100 IU/ml IL-2.Note: Tregs should be expanded and rested using protocols established by the user’s lab. Details of how Tregs were expanded and rested for this protocol are provided in Dawson et al. (2020). Briefly, Tregs were isolated from peripheral blood and polyclonally expanded with artificial APCs in the presence of 1000 IU/ml IL-2 for 7 days. Tregs were then rested by culturing in fresh medium with 100 IU/ml IL-2 overnight. CAR Tregs were generated by lentivirally transducing polyclonal Tregs one day post-stimulation. Set up moDC and Treg co-culture in a 1-to-5 ratio (50,000 DCs to 250,000 Tregs per well): add 100 μl Treg cell suspension into the wells containing moDCs from Step H1.Control wells: set up one well of moDC alone and another well of Treg alone as controls in separate wells with a final volume of 200 µl per well.",

Day 11 analysis of CD80 and CD86 on mature moDCs following co-culture with Tregs. (A-B) Mature moDCs and Tregs were co-cultured for 4 days, and then cells were stained as described in Table 3 and in accordance with “Guidelines for the use of flow cytometry and cell sorting in immunological studies” (Cossarizza et al., 2019); they were acquired with a BD LSRFortessa X-20 and data analysed using FlowJo. (A) Gating strategy to identify mature moDCs. Live singlet cells were gated, and moDCs were identified as CD11c+CD4‒ cells. (B) Expression of CD80 (left) and CD86 (right) following co-culture with Tregs. This assay was performed using HLA-A2+ moDCs co-cultured with either polyclonal ΔNGFR-transduced Tregs or HLA-A2-specific CAR-transduced Tregs. Compared to moDCs cultured alone (black line), polyclonal Tregs exert a moderate level of suppression (green), as determined by the decrease in CD80 and CD86 expression. This suppression is greater when co-cultures are performed with A2-CAR Tregs (blue). See Dawson et al. (2020) for more examples."
