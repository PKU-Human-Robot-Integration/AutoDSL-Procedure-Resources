    "Preparation of seedlings for raising insectsPrior to inoculation of RBSDV, 80-100 rice seedlings are needed to obtain a big population of the small brown planthoppers. Plump seeds of the rice variety ‘Wuyujing 3’ are pre-germinated by immersing them in water for 2 days, rinsing thoroughly with water and then allowing them to germinate on water-soaked filter paper for 1 day. 150-200 ml of fine soil is added to clean 1 L beakers and moistened with 100 ml water added along the beaker wall. About 100 pre-germinated seeds are then scattered on the soil and sprinkled with a thin layer of soil. The beakers are covered with gauze (Figure 1) and placed on the shelf in a growth room at 25-27 °C, relative humidity 50%-70%, 14/24 h light with intensity 5,000-7,000 lux until the rice seedlings have grown to 6 cm (about 10-day-old seedlings), when they can be used for feeding the small brown planthoppers (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171212/20171212181450_7571.jpgFigure 1.

Planted rice seedlings indoorsThe source of RBSDV infected rice plantsRBSDV-infected rice plants (Figure 3) are collected from the field (Jining city, Shandong Province) and the presence of RBSDV is confirmed by RT-PCR. Total RNA is extracted from leaves with symptoms using Trizol Reagent. Reverse transcription is performed using the reverse transcription kit with random primers, following the instructions supplied (Vazyme). The primers used were designed from the published sequence of S10 of RBSDV (S10-Forward: AAC AAC CGA CCA ACA ATC AC and S10-Reverse: GAG CAG GAA CTT CAC GAC AG). The detailed steps are as follows:Reverse transcription (10 μl), the aim of this step is to reverse transcribe the RNA into cDNA.Remove Genomic DNA (the reaction in the RNase-free tube) using the following reaction:table:\n﻿0,1\nRNase-free ddH2O,to 8 μl\n4x gDNA mix (containing DNase),2 μl",

    "Agarose gel electrophoresisPreparation of gels: Firstly, weigh 1 g of agarose into a glass bottle with blue cap. Secondly, add 100 ml TAE buffer, and heat in a microwave oven until completely dissolved.Production of plastic sheet: After the above-mentioned agarose gel has cooled to about 65 °C, add the right amount of ethidium bromide dye and then pour into a transparent plate with a pre-inserted comb.Add sample: Firstly, put the agarose gel plate into an electrophoresis tank and gently move the plate to squeeze out the bubbles within the discharge hole. Then, add 5 μl of DNA marker to the first well followed by the PCR products in turn to the following wells. To avoid cross-contamination between samples, use a new pipette tip for each sample. Finally, connect to the power supply and adjust the voltage to 150-180 V.Observation: Turn off the power when the front of the band has reached about halfway down the gel, remove the plate and gently dry the electrophoresis buffer. Then put the gel into a gel imaging system to observe.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171212/20171212183910_3804.jpgFigure 3. RBSDV infected rice plantsPropagation of the healthy planthopper populationIt takes about a month for planthoppers to complete their life cycle which consists of 5 instar nymph stages (Figure 4A), and 1 adult stage. The fifth instar nymphs (recognized through the short black line on the abdomen of the female) have the ability to spawn. The adults are transferred to fresh ‘Wuyujing 3’ rice seedlings (100-150 planthoppers/beaker) with the pooter (Figure 4B), allowed to spawn for 48 h (Figure 4C), and the adults are then removed with a brush. Generally, small white hatched nymphs will be seen on the rice seedlings 7-10 days later (Figure 4D). The nymphs on the seedlings can be used to acquire RBSDV.",
    "It is advised to restrict the watering of rice seedlings before collecting nymphs.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171212/20171212184008_2712.jpgFigure 4.

Hatched out the first and second instar nymphs.Rice black-streaked dwarf virus inoculationsSeveral RBSDV-infected rice plants prepared as described in Procedure B are washed with water and planted in a 3 L beaker. First to second instar nymphs prepared as described in Procedure C are collected from the rice plants on which they have been reared, and released onto the RBSDV-infected rice plants (about 150-200 planthoppers/plant) for 3-5 days to acquire virus (Figure 5). Subsequently, the planthoppers are transferred to healthy ‘Wuyujing 3’ rice seedlings for an incubation period of 10-12 days. The proportion of viruliferous planthoppers is then assessed by using a dot immunobinding assay (DIBA) with antibodies against the viral structural proteins (Zhou and Liu, 2004; Yang et al., 2007) (see Procedure E). For RBSDV inoculation, planthoppers are transferred by pooter to test seedlings at the 2-3 leaf stage and allowed to feed for 3 days. The numbers transferred are calculated to ensure that three viruliferous adult planthoppers are present on each seedling. The planthoppers are then removed and the seedlings are grown in the greenhouse for symptom observation.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171212/20171212184122_9423.jpgFigure 5. The instar nymphs acquire virus on RBSDV infected rice plantsDot Immunobinding Assay (DIBA)To determine the viruliferous rate of the SBPH population, the method for DIBA is used for the detection of RBSDV in single SBPH. The detailed steps are as follows:Put a single SBPH into a fresh centrifuge tube (500 μl) and add 80 μl carbonate coating solution. Then use a toothpick to mash the insect and pipette 2 μl supernatant onto the NC membrane.",
    "Dry it at room temperature.Immerse the NC membrane into PBS-T blocking solution containing 5% skimmed milk in the condition (37 °C, 50 rpm, shake 1 h).Transfer the NC membrane into blocking solution containing anti-P10 (1:1,000) at the condition (37 °C, 50 rpm, shake 2 h). Wash the membrane 3 times with PBS-T for 10 min each time.Transfer the NC membrane into blocking solution containing horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat antimouse immunoglobulin G (1:5,000) at the condition (37 °C, 50 rpm, shake 1.5 h). Wash the membrane 3 times with PBS-T for 10 min each time.Remove the PBS-T solution from the NC membrane with filter paper and cover the NC membrane with TMB color-substrate solution. React for 5-15 min in the dark until the positive control is conspicuous.Symptom evaluation after RBSDV inoculationSymptoms on the inoculated rice seedlings (Procedure D) are assessed 30 days after transfer to the glasshouse by measuring the plant height and by RT-PCR (see Procedure B)."
