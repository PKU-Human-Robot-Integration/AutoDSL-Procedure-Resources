    "Ethics statement: Human studies require written informed consent of participants before study entry. Obtain approval by the relevant ethics committee before recruitment of participants. Make sure studies are in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The representative findings reported here (Figure 4) are based on a study performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki amended by the 59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, October 2008 and approved by the local Ethics Committee of the University of Freiburg. All subjects gave written informed consent before study entry6.\n1. Safety Screening\nScreen the participant for potential contraindications for noninvasive brain stimulation3, e.g., by using questionnaires25.\n2. Motor Cortex Localization\nLocate the participant's hand motor cortex by one of two distinct approaches, by locating the brain representation of the muscle of interest by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced MEP, or by locating the standard M1 position (C3/C4) based on the EEG 10/20 international system with a measuring tape26.\nFor TMS-induced MEP recording ask the participant to remove any object that may be influenced by TMS magnetic field, including credit cards, mobile phones and metal objects in general.\nAsk the participant to sit comfortably.\nVerify connections between EMG amplifier and the computer used for signal configuration and acquisition when using a software interface.\nTurn on the EMG amplifier and connect EMG electrode cables.\nClean participant's skin by softly rubbing with skin preparation paste in the regions of the hand where the electrodes will be placed. Remove excess with clean gauze pad.\nAttach EMG surface electrodes in a belly-tendon montage on the hand muscle of interest (e.g., M. abductor pollicis brevis of the right hand) and connect a ground electrode (e.g., on forearm). The purpose of the study determines which hand muscle to use.",
    "Note: For reusable electrodes it is necessary to apply a small amount of conductive paste on the electrode surface before attaching it to the participant's skin.\n(optional step) Start the recording software for MEP acquisition if MEP data storage is desired.\nCheck the EMG impedance values. Ensure that the impedance is < 20 kOhm.\nTurn on the magnetic stimulator and charge the capacitor by pressing the corresponding \"charge\" button.\nPlace a figure-of-eight TMS coil on the participant scalp on the interhemispheric fissure and move it to the motor cortex area (around positions C3/C4 of the EEG 10/20 international system). Hold the TMS coil at a 45o-50o angle referenced to the interhemispheric fissure27,28, with the handle oriented backwards, producing a cortical current flow from posterior to anterior29.\nNote: Two distinct TMS coils are used for motor cortex localization: figure-of-eight or circular coils. If possible, use a figure-of-eight coil as it provides more focal brain stimulation30 and greater reliability of measurements of cortical excitability31.\nWhen the magnetic stimulator is charged (visible on the display), discharge the stimulator either by pressing the trigger button or by stepping on the foot switch or automatically by a software program. This will subsequently deliver a single TMS pulse through the connected TMS coil placed over the participant's scalp. Default TMS pulse settings (e.g., 100 µs rise time of the induced current and 800 µs decay time for monophasic stimuli; shorter decay times for biphasic stimuli) are specific to the device (firmware).\nStart with low stimulation intensity (e.g., set the intensity to 45% output using the stimulation intensity controller knob on the stimulator) and watch for MEPs visible on the EMG amplifier.",
    "If no MEP is visible increase the stimulation intensity in 2-5% steps until an MEP is clearly present (e.g., 0.5-1 mV amplitude). Repeat stimulation by pressing the trigger button or activating the foot switch if pulse delivery is not automated. Inform the participant that stimulation will be slightly stronger and that limb movements, facial twitch and eye-blinks are expected.\nNote: Establish a minimum interval of 5 sec between pulses to avoid low-frequency stimulation effects on brain excitability.\nMove the coil radially in 1 cm steps around the initially stimulated site to find the spot with the largest MEP response following the application of single TMS pulses. From there, start again moving the coil to secure the \"hotspot\" (cortical area with maximal MEP amplitude).\nNote: The use of a head cap (e.g., used for grid markings) for the localization procedure is not recommended since the cap needs to be removed for NEBS electrode placement and the hotspot position may be lost.\nReduce the stimulation intensity in approximately 2%-steps using the stimulation intensity controller knob on the stimulator (MEP must still be present). This will avoid inaccuracy due to supramaximal stimulation. Reconfirm the hotspot by moving the coil radially in 1 cm steps around the hotspot and checking for MEP size. The hotspot should still correspond to the largest and most consistent MEP amplitude.",
    "Note: Ask the participant to voluntarily contract the muscle of interest if the hotspot is difficult to find (e.g., no MEP present at high stimulation intensities). By doing so, the stimulation intensity needed to elicit MEP is decreased and it may be easier to identify relevant cortical stimulation sites. If this method is used, ask the participant to relax the muscle after finding a relevant stimulation site and adjust stimulation intensity so that reliable MEPs can be found when the muscle is at rest. Proceed to find the hotspot.\nMark the hotspot position and coil orientation with non-permanent skin marker.\nFor bilateral M1 stimulation, repeat steps 2.11 to 2.16 for the contralateral limb.\n3. NEBS Electrode Preparation\nConnect cables to rubber electrodes, and place the electrodes inside the sponge bags. Make sure electrode size and sponge bag size do match. Materials are commercially available in standard sizes (e.g., 5x5 cm2, 5x7 cm2).\nSoak sponge bags on both sides with isotonic NaCl solution, but avoid excessive soaking to prevent salt bridges or dripping onto the volunteer.\n\t\nThis step is optional: To prevent leakage of NaCl solution when using bandages instead of rubber bands, place the electrodes and sponge bags inside non-conductive rubber sponge covers.\nNote: Alternatively, cover the rubber electrode with conductive paste and place them directly on the participant's head, i.e., not using sponge bags or rubber sponge covers.\n4. NEBS Electrode Placement (Figure 1)\nFind the head marking(s) indicating the motor cortical hotspot and separate the hair around the area.",
    "To improve conductance clean the skin before electrode placement by gently rubbing the skin area around the head markings with a swab soaked with 40-50% alcohol or skin preparation paste. Do not scratch the skin! Remove excess with a swab and clean area again with isotonic NaCl solution. Dry the area afterwards.\nNote: Make sure the head marking(s) remain visible; remark if needed.\nPlace one electrode following the head marking for the M1 of interest (contralateral to the hand of interest). Bring the sponge as much as possible in direct contact with the skin. Place the electrode cable towards the participant's back to avoid disturbance during stimulation and/or task execution and to ease connection to the NEBS device.\nNote: The hair below the electrode should get damp. In case of excessive hair moistening, use paper or hand towels to absorb the excess.\nNote: For anodal tDCS, the electrode placed on the motor cortical hotspot of interest (increase of excitability is desired) corresponds to the anode, usually connected to the red cable. The cathode (usually connected to a black or blue cable) is placed on the opposite supraorbital area or M1 (see below). Conventionally, electrode placement is the same for tRNS, although in the classical protocol there is no polarity specificity due to the alternating current flow. Specific placement may be important if the stimulation settings include a stimulation offset.\nFor unilateral M1 stimulation place the second electrode (for anodal tDCS: the cathode) over the contralateral supra-orbital area (corresponding to electrode Fp2 in the EEG 10/20 international system). Make sure the cable is oriented towards the back of the participant.",
    "For bilateral M1 stimulation skip step 4.4. Place the second electrode (for anodal tDCS: the cathode) on the opposite M1 following the head marking ipsilateral to the limb used in the study. Make sure the cable is oriented towards the back of the participant.\nCover the head twice with an elastic bandage circularly in the medio-lateral direction to stabilize the M1 electrode, then use the remaining bandage to cover the head circularly in the anterior-posterior direction to stabilize both electrodes.\nUse an adhesive tape to fix the end of the bandage.\nSecure the cables with an adhesive tape on the participant's neck or shirt.\nConnect electrode cables to the NEBS device.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53367/53367fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Materials used for NEBS protocols.

Stimulation\nSwitch on the NEBS device.\nAdjust NEBS device settings regarding stimulation type (tDCS or tRNS), intensity (e.g., 1 mA, 1.5 mA or 2 mA), duration (e.g., 10-40 min), ramping up and down (time between beginning of stimulation and maximum intensity, typically 8-15 sec), and additional factors related to stimulation type (e.g., frequency spectrum for tRNS).",
    "Note: Conventionally, sham stimulation includes ramping up immediately followed by ramping down. Accordingly, the participant has the sensation of the stimulation but the duration of the stimulation is not sufficient to exert lasting effects on brain function. Some NEBS devices include a study mode which allows blinding of participant and investigator by entering a study specific subject code. The code determines stimulation settings automatically. Alternatively, a second experimenter may set the stimulation settings in each session and cover the display from the experimenter conducting the stimulation.\nInform the participant about potential side effects associated with NEBS. Common adverse effects include skin itching/tingling or burning sensation underneath the electrodes, headache, and discomfort32. Burning sensation may be a sign of poor electrode contact with the skin.\nStart the stimulation.\nNote: Common stimulation duration lasts approximately 10-20 min based on reports investigating changes on cortical excitability (see representative results section). Empirically, the maximum stimulation duration was set to 40 min3.\nCheck for continuity of stimulation during ramping up and stimulation. If impedance is too high or electrodes are in bad contact with the skin, the stimulation may terminate automatically.\nNote: In case the impedance is too high or the participant reports increasing discomfort during the stimulation try to decrease impedance by, e.g., better fixating the electrodes at the stimulation sites or adding conductive medium. NaCl solution may be added by using a syringe directly in the sponges after their placement on the head.\nNote: For safety reasons some devices report the impedance throughout the stimulation. The NEBS device may shut off if impedance reaches a specific threshold (e.g., 55 kOhms).",
    "If NEBS is co-applied with execution of a motor task, start the testing/training after stimulation is ramped up and the participant is feeling comfortable with stimulation. In case the study does not include a motor task during stimulation, make sure the participant remains seated and awake during the stimulation period, and wait until stimulation is over.\nCheck with the participant for side effects of the stimulation, e.g., by handing out a standardized questionnaire32 or directly asking the participant. In case of studies including multiple days of stimulation, take note of any possible side effects between days.\nNote: For assessment of blinding efficacy, ask the participant after each stimulation session to guess which stimulation type (sham/condition) the participant underwent. If the experimenter is also blinded, the experimenter could also note his guess regarding the participant's stimulation type. Compare answers with the actual stimulation type to verify rate of correct guesses33.\nDisinfect electrodes and sponges with non-hazardous substances such as 40-50% alcohol. Thoroughly rinse in water afterwards. Let materials dry before storing.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
