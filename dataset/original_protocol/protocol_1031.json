    "Sample collection and protein extract\n1. Collect approximately 5 × 108 cells expressing either untagged or HA-epitope tagged versions of protein to immunoprecipitate from exponentially growing yeast cultures.\n  \n2. Collect the cells by centrifugation at 4000xg and wash them once with H2O. \n  \n3. Resuspend the cell pellet in 100 μL of Lysis buffer.\n  \n4. Lyse the cells by vigorous shaking with glass beads for 3 min at 4°C.\n  \n5. Clarify the sample at 13400xg for 5 min at 4ºC. \n  \n6. Keep 10 μl from the supernatant as a control of whole-cell extract \\(Input).\n  \nDynabeads Protein G preparation\n7. Wash twice 50µL of Dynabeads with PBS containing Tween 0.02%.\n  \n8. Incubate for 30 min at room temperature the dried beads with 10µL of HA-probe \\(F-7) antibody \\(Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc) supplemented with 190µL PBS-Tween 0,02%.\n  \n9. Wash the unbound antibody twice with PBS-Tween 0,02%.\n  \nImmunoprecipitation\n10. Incubate the remaining volume of the whole cell extract with Dynabeads-antibody with orbital rotation for 20 min at room temperature.\n  \n11. Keep 10 μL from the supernatant as a control of unbound protein.\n  \n12. Wash the beads 5 times with PBS-Tween 0,02%.  \n  \n13. Elute the immunoprecipitated  proteins by boiling the beads for 5 min in 2x SDS-PAGE sample solvent and analyze by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blot analysis."
