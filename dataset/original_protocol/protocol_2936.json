Undifferentiated iPSC can be plated and next day the differentiation begins. 7 days of differentiation is composed with simple medium changes every 2 days. There are 2 different media: day 1–3 and day 3–7.\nPrepare coating of 6 well plates by adding of 1 mL of vitronectin solution to each well of entire surface and leave at 17°C–22°C for 1 h.\nNote: Do not leave in the biosafety laminar flow hood since it can cause drying of the plates. Leave on tabletop if not disturbed. If the plate is not used, store at 4°C refrigerator. Wrap with clean aluminum foil in case needed to avoid contamination.\nBring E8 medium and versene to 17°C–22°C by leaving on the tabletop for 15 min.\nCritical: Do not warm up the E8 medium at 37°C since bFGF half-life in E8 medium is temperature sensitive.\nGrow iPSC in iPSC culture media (E8 medium) in a 6-well plate. When iPSC culture reaches to 80% confluency cells can be prepared to initiate differentiation.\nWash cells once in 2 mL PBS/well.\nAdd 1 mL versene/well and incubate for 5 min at 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator.\nSwirl or gently tap the side of plate to detach cells.\nNote: If the cells don’t lift, do not pipet to detach. Leave another 5 min at 17°C–22°C and swirl or gently tap the side of the plate.\nTransfer 80 μL of cells along with versene solution to each well of a new 6-well plate precoated with vitronectin and containing 2 mL of E8 medium including 5 μM of Rock inhibitor.\nPrepare 2-3 plates (12–18 wells) for the differentiation set.",
    "Next day, begin the APEL2 (Albumin Poly-vinyl-alcohol Essential Lipids) differentiation process with iPSC cultures that have small colonies and a density of 10%–20% (See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], Day 2)\nRemove E8 medium from iPSC and add 2.5 mL of day 1–3 differentiation medium for days 1–3. Mark the starting day as day 1.\nKeep the plate in a 37°C incubator until day 3 without changing medium for 48 h.\nOn day 3, prepare day 3–7 medium and warm up to 17°C–22°C.\nRemove plate from the 37°C incubator. Swirl it before removing the medium in order to remove most of the floating cells. It is expected to observe significant numbers of floating cells.\nReplace with 2.5 mL of day 3–7 medium at day 3.\nReplace with 3 mL of day 3–7 medium at day 5.\nMACS sorting and plating the CD31+ and CD31− cells\nTiming: 3–4 h\nThis step explains single cell preparation of differentiating cells, antibody staining for magnetic cell sorting separation, and culture of purified CD31− and CD31+ cells.\nCell preparation for MACS\nAt day 7 of APEL differentiation, wash cells once with 2 mL PBS per well.\nAdd 1 mL of TrypLE.\nIncubate 5 min at 37°C incubator.\nUse P1000 pipet to gently detach cells and incubate another 5 min.\nCollect cells in 50 mL conical tube that already include 10 mL MACS buffer to stop TrypLE.\nUse MACS buffer to wash wells and add to cell suspension.\nMake total volume 45 mL with MACS buffer that includes cells from 12–18 wells.\nNote: dilute the cell suspension enough to see through the solution. If the cell solution is too dense, loss of cells at the filtering step will be greater.\nFilter cell solution through 20 μm cell strainer.\nCentrifuge for 5 min, 100 g.\nAntibody staining",
    "Remove the supernatant and tap the tube to dislodge the cell pellet.\nAdd 5 mL MACS buffer including 5 μM Rock inhibitor final concentration per 6 wells (one 6-well plate) equivalent cells for cell count.\nNote: Expect to yield around 1.5 ± 0.16 × 106 cells (N = 12 experiments) from one well of 6-well plate at this stage.\nCentrifuge for 5 min, 100g.\nRemove the supernatant and tap the tube to dislodge the cell pellet.\nAdd MACS buffer including 5 μM Rock inhibitor and FcR blocker (from CD31 microbead kit) and mix well with the cells (See the Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] for volume)\nAdd anti-CD31 microbead to the cell solution and pipet to mix or gently vortex the solution.\nNote: See Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] for appropriate volume for staining.\nIncubate microbead-cell solution for 15 min at 4°C.\nAdd 20 mL of MACS buffer for approximately 1 × 107 cells equivalent for washing.\nfilter through 20 μm cell strainer.\nNote: Magnetic beads tagged microbeads form less than 1 μm in diameter on cell surfaces, even with massive labeling, so they will not interfere with filtration through the 20 μm cell strainer.\nCentrifuge for 5 min, 100 g.\nCell separation\nDuring the centrifugation, set the magnetic station, LS separation column, and 15 mL conical tubes below the column.\nAdd 2 mL of MACS buffer to wash the column.\nOnce centrifugation is complete, remove the supernatant and tap the tube to dislodge the pellet.\nResuspend cells in 1 mL of MACS buffer including 5 μM Rock inhibitor for less than 2 × 109 cells (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]).\nLoad cells on the top of the LS column.\nCollect the CD31− flow through of cells.",
    "Add 3 mL of MACS buffer to the column and collect the 1st wash of cell flow through that will lead to total 6 mL of cell solution (see steps 3b. and 3d.).\nChange to new conical tube and wash 2 more times with 3 mL of MACS buffer. Discard these two wash throughs.\nDetach the column from the magnetic station and put above a new conical tube labeled CD31+ cells.\nAdd 2 mL of EGM2 medium or MACS buffer including 5 μM Rock inhibitor to the top of LS column.\nImmediately flush out the medium to collect CD31+ cells.\nCell plating\nCentrifuge CD31− cells and resuspend in 1 mL of EGM2 medium per column eluted including 5 μM Rock inhibitor.\ne.g., Resuspend in 4 mL if eluted from 4 LS columns.\nTake 10 μL of cell solution and mix with 10 μL of trypan blue to count live cell number.\nNote: Expected to yield 8.3 ± 0.65 × 105 cells (69 ± 1.2% of pre-sort population, N = 5 experiments).\nCount CD31+ cells with the same method. Additional centrifugation is not necessary if the cells were eluted in CD31+ EGM2 plating medium.\nNote: Expected to yield 2.7 ± 0.02 × 105 cells (17.4 ± 1.3% of pre-sort population, N = 7 experiments).\nPlate 1 × 104 CD31+ cells/cm2 on fibronectin coated flasks in CD31+ EGM2 plating medium (7.5 × 105 cells/T75 flask).\nPlate 2 × 104 CD31− cells/ cm2 on gelatin coated flasks in CD31− EGM2 plating medium (maximum plating density 1.5 × 106 cells/T75 flask).\nInduced endothelial cell (iEC) expansion, freezing and thawing\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nThis step explains how to expand iEC prior to cryopreservation, thaw and recover from thawing before used for experiments.\nChange the medium",

Cells were cryopreserved until the experiment. When thawed (P1) and passaged, cells demonstrated typical endothelial cell morphology. It is not recommended to passage cells beyond P3. Scale bars are 250 μm.\nAvoid culturing more than 7 days.
