  "procedures": [
    "All procedures were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the National Council for the control of Animal Experimentation (CONCEA, Brazil) and were approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal Research of the Medical School of the University of Sao Paulo (CEUA-FMUSP, Brazil - protocol number: 25/15).\nNOTE: In this protocol, we show how to induce a lysolecithin rat model of multiple sclerosis and how to acquire and analyze the myelin PET images.\n1. Lysolecithin solution preparation\nWeigh lysolecithin (L-α-Lysophosphatidylcholine from egg yolk) on an analytical scale using a conic plastic tube (1.5 mL).\nAdd sterile saline to the tube to make 1% solution (for example: weigh 1 mg of lysolecithin and dissolve it with 100 µL of saline) and dissolve the lysolecithin by shaking the tube (shaking from side to side and not turning from top to bottom).\nPrepare the solution just before starting the animal model induction (do not stock the final ready solution).\n2. Lysolecithin rat model - Stereotaxic surgery\nUse male Wistar rats weighing between 220 - 270 g. Use gloves and mask during all procedures.\nInduce anesthesia with 5% isoflurane mixed in 100% O2 (1 L/min) using an induction box. Check if the animal is anesthetized by observing absence of movement (only breathing should be observed).\nPlace the animal in stereotaxic apparatus on a heating pad. Fix the nose and ears of the animal to the equipment.\n\t​NOTE: Details of how to perform stereotaxic surgery can be found in JoVE Science Education Database. Neuroscience. Rodent Stereotaxic Surgery. JoVE, Cambridge, MA, 2021.\n\t\nMonitor the anesthesia for the whole procedure (including surgery and image acquisition). To adjust the isoflurane concentration, observe the animal breathing rate. A fast breathing rate requires higher concentration and a slow breathing rate requires lower anesthetic concentration.",
    "Inject the analgesic (ketoprofen - 5 mg/kg) subcutaneously (dilute the medication to 1 mL in saline, this will help to hydrate the animal).\nPut eye cream in the animal's eyes to protect against dehydration.\nUse a 0.5% chlorhexidine solution to clean the incision area.\nInject 100 µL of lidocaine hydrochloride 2% subcutaneously in the region of incision.\nShave the skull area.\nUse sterile instruments for this procedure.\nUsing a scalpel, make an incision of about 2 cm in the skin over the skull.\nExpose the skull with Bulldog clamps.\nUse a swab to clean the skull area with 1% hydrogen peroxidase.\nLocate and mark the bregma (a stereotaxic rat brain atlas can help to identity the Bregma).\nPosition the Hamilton syringe (µL neuros syringes) at the bregma.\nUsing the bregma and a stereotaxic atlas as reference, position the Hamilton syringe at the following coordinates: Antero-posterior: -0.30 mm, latero-lateral: -3.0 mm, and ventral until it touches skull bone, and mark the skull and note the coordinates orientation on paper.\nDrill the skull at the marked coordinate. Take care with dura mater (damaging dura mater can cause a lot of bleeding).\nFill the Hamilton syringe with 7 µL of lysolecithin solution (1% in saline). A greater volume can be placed in the syringe, but only 7 µL will be injected (take the bubbles out of the syringe to measure the volume correctly).\nPosition the Hamilton syringe at the previous coordinates to start the drug injection (total of 7 µL into 3 different ventral stereotactic coordinates). Considering the previously noted coordinates, lower the Hamilton syringe to ventral coordinate -5.0 mm.\nVery slowly inject 2 µL of lysolecithin solution (1 µL/10 min). Wait 3 min.",
    "Take the needle up to the next ventral stereotaxic coordinate (-4.2 mm) and slowly inject 2µL of lysolecithin solution (1 µL/ 10 min). Wait 3 min.\nInject the third ventral coordinate -3.0 mm (3 µL of lysolecithin solution - 1 µL/ 10 min).\nWait 5 min and then remove the Hamilton syringe from the brain.\nSuture the skin.\nRemove the animal from the stereotactic apparatus and allow the animal to awaken.\nReturn the animal to the home cage, keep the animal alone and under supervision to check for signs of discomfort.\nInject subcutaneous analgesic (ketoprofen - 5 mg/kg) diluted in saline, at 24 h and 48 h after the surgery.\n3. PET acquisition\nTake 7 to 20 MBq of 11C-PIB radioactivity in a syringe (1 mL is the maximum volume allowed for intravenous injection in rats).\nAnesthetize the animal with 5% isoflurane mixed in 100% O2 (1 L/min) using the induction box.\nInject 11C-PIB (radioactivity defined in item 4.1 above) into the penile vein, or tail vein of the rat (both administration sites are fine, the decision is a personal choice. We only advice not to use a retro-orbital injection since the location is too close to the region of interest (the brain) and can impair image quality.\n\tNOTE: Image acquisition of baseline time point is performed before stereotaxic injection and the other 2 time points at 1 week and 4 weeks after surgery.\nRemove the animal from anesthesia to allow the animal to awaken (leave the animal on a warm pad until it is completely awake).\nReturn the animal to the home cage.\nWait 30 min for the next step.\nAnesthetize the rats with 5% isoflurane mixed in 100% O2 (1 L/min) using an induction box.\nOpen PET scanner software.\nSelect Scan > Pet Ready.",
    "Complete principal investigator details, Study ID, Series ID, Animal ID, Animal weight (g), and Additional notes. Select Next.\n\tNOTE: Use dot (.) for decimal number in the animal weight.\nEdit ROI area for scanning (usually between 3 and 8). This is the area that will be included in the image (areas between the numbers 3 and 8 of the bed cover will appear in the final image).\nPosition the anaesthetized rat on a standard rat bed of the PET scanner and turn the anesthesia on (3% isoflurane in 100% O2 is a good start, and then the anesthesia rate should be adjusted as necessary). To adjust the anesthesia, check the monitoring data of the scanner software to verify that the animal is breathing in a constant and slow rhythm.\n\tNOTE: Turn on the vacuum pump coupled to the activated carbon filter to collect isoflurane gas excess (if the pump is available).\nApply eye cream to protect the animal's eyes.\nPush the animal bed inside the PET scanner.\nComplete Activity details, Activity Calibration Time, Isotope (C-11), and Scan duration (20 minutes). Select Start Scan.\n\tNOTE: A Pet Moving Bed message will appear, and the animal bed will move into the equipment and stop at the previously selected ROI position. Time of acquisition will start count down and number of counts per seconds will appear (CPS).\nIn the scanner software, navigate to the Monitor tab on the left of the screen, check Change Threshold to Respiratory parameters change (BPM).\n\tNOTE: A window will pop up, complete with threshold parameter (500). Select OK.\nNavigate to 0% POWER to change temperature parameters to heat the animal during scan. A window will pop up; complete the parameter (80 - 100). Select OK.",
    "NOTE: Choose between 80 and 100% power based on room temperature conditions (the more power, the warmer it will get).\nNavigate back to SCAN tab.\nNavigate to configuration tool (gear icon) and complete Injection Time, Remaining Activity, Remaining Activity Calibration Time. Select Save.\n\tNOTE: A window will pop up \"Are you sure you want to modify the protocol metadata?\"> YES\nNavigate back to the Monitor tab (check the animal's respiratory parameters, and if necessary, increase or decrease isoflurane concentration - usually 3% in 100% O2 is enough).\nWhen PET acquisition is finished, Pet Ready message will appear on the Scan tab, check Arrow Out Icon (left of configuration tool) to move out the animal bed.\nRemove the animal from anesthesia and allow to awaken on a warm pad.\nFor reconstructing the image, navigate to Reconstruct tab.\nCheck plus icon at bottom left of the screen, and select the study file which will be reconstructed. Select Next.\nNavigate to Energy Resolution tool. A window will pop up. Configure the energy peak (keV) to the equipment parameter (based on monthly quality control). Select Close.\n\tNOTE: Energy peak can change every month when performing monthly equipment calibration.\nKeep all other parameters as the default (Isometric voxel size: 400 mm; number of iterations: 30; Energy resolution: 30%; Save last iteration only; uncheck Keep binary data) .\nCheck Add.\n\t​NOTE: A window will pop up \"The reconstruction was added to the queue and will start once the others have finished\". Select OK. A file will appear in the reconstruction list on the Reconstruct tab and the status will appear as waiting or % (progress) or finished.\n4. Image Analysis",
