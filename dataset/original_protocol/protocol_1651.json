Nuclease-free reagents need to be used in all steps of the protocol.\nNuclei isolation\nTiming: 1 h\nThe following steps describe the procedure to isolate intact nuclei from worms or embryos. The protocol has been tested with 1,000 to 40,000 worms and 40,000 to 300,000 early embryos.\nResuspend worms or embryos in 1.5 mL of cold Nuclei extraction buffer (NEB) and transfer to a pre-chilled stainless steel tissue grinder on ice.\nLyse worms to release nuclei by applying 40 dounce strokes.\nCritical: take a small aliquot of the lysate (10–20 μL) and check that the worms are lysed using a stereomicroscope. Intact bodies and embryos should be absent. If intact corpses are still present, increase the number of dounce strokes.\nTransfer the lysate to a pre-chilled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nNote: Multiple samples can be processed simultaneously. If so, keep lysate from step 3 on ice while lysing the other samples. In this case, wash the metal dounce well between each sample with milliQ water. After processing all the samples, proceed immediately to step 4.\nRemove debris by centrifuging at 100×g for 4 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 mL low binding microcentrifuge tube.\nCritical: carefully collect the supernatant without disturbing the debris pellet. If necessary, repeat steps 4 and 5 until lysate is clear from debris. A residual 50–100 μL can be left in the tube to avoid debris carryover.\nPellet nuclei by centrifuging at 1,000×g for 4 min at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant and wash nuclei with 1 mL NEB.",
    "Critical: wash nuclei by pipetting up and down several times using a wide-bore tip. Gently pipette nuclei to preserve their integrity.\nPellet nuclei by centrifuging at 1,000×g for 4 min at 4°C.\nRepeat steps 7 and 8 three more times for a total of 4 washes with NEB.\nWash nuclei in 1 mL Freezing buffer NO-Glycerol.\nCritical: wash nuclei by pipetting up and down several times using a wide-bore tip. Gently pipette nuclei to preserve their integrity.\nPellet nuclei by centrifuging at 1,000×g for 4 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend nuclei in 100 μL Freezing buffer.\nPause point: nuclei in the Freezing buffer can be stored at −80°C for up to 1 year.\nNuclear run-on (NRO) reaction\nTiming: 15 min\nNRO is performed on isolated nuclei in the presence of Bio-11-UTP. Sarkosyl is added to prevent de novo assembly of the pre-initiation complex and avoid new transcriptional initiation. A negative NRO control reaction can be added at this step. In the negative NRO reaction, UTP is used instead of Biotinylated-UTP. If you are performing the experiment for the first time, the addition of negative control is strongly recommended.\nPrepare the NRO 2x mix (the recipe is listed in the “Materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]” section), and preheat it at 30°C before use.\nDispense 80 μL of the NRO 2× mix in a new low binding microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 20 μL of Bio-11-UTP 10 mM to the NRO 2× mix (final Bio-11-UTP concentration: 1 mM) and gently mix.\nCritical: if running a negative NRO reaction, replace Bio-11-UTP with 0.5 μL of UTP 100 mM and 19.5 μL of nuclease-free water.\nAdd 100 μL of lysed nuclei from the previous step 12. Gently mix the reaction well using a wide bore tip.\nIncubate the reaction for 3 min at 30°C.",
    "Transfer the tubes on ice and add 50 μL ice-cold nuclease-free water and 750 μL TRIzol LS reagent and mix well to stop the reaction.\nIncubate nuclei in TRIzol for 5 min at room temperature (20°C–25˚C) to permit complete dissociation of the nucleoprotein complexes.\nCritical: TRIzol has an acute oral and dermal toxicity. Always handle in a chemical hood. Contact with eyes and skin should be avoided.\nPause point: Nuclei in TRIzol can be stored at −80°C for up to a week (we have not tested longer storage).\nRNA isolation using TRIzol\nTiming: 1 h 15 min\nTotal RNA, including biotinylated nascent RNA, is isolated using TRIzol.\nAdd 100 μL of 1-Bromo-3-chloropropane (BCP) and mix it well by vortexing.\nCritical: BCP is toxic upon inhalation. Always handle in a chemical hood.\nIncubate at RT for 15 min.\nCentrifuge at 12,000×g for 15 min at 4°C, then transfer the aqueous phase (upper phase) containing the RNA to a new low binding microcentrifuge tube.\nNote: Avoid transferring any of the interphase or organic layer into the pipette when removing the aqueous phase. The tube can be angled at 45° to facilitate the process. Approximately 450 μL of aqueous phase can be collected at this step.\nAdd 2 μL of GlycoBlue and mix it well by vortexing for 5–10 s.\nAdd 500 μL of isopropanol and mix it vigorously by vortexing for 10–15 s.\nIncubate at RT for 15 min to precipitate the RNA.\nCentrifuge at 12,000×g for 15 min at 4°C to pellet the RNA.\nRemove the supernatant and add 1 mL of 75 % Ethanol to the RNA pellet.\nCentrifuge at 7,500×g for 5 min at 4°C.\nNote: After centrifugation, a blue pellet should be visible at the bottom of the tube.",
    "Critical: Carefully remove the supernatant without disturbing the RNA pellet.\nRemove the supernatant and air dry the pellet for 1–2 min.\nNote: to completely remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet you can use the following procedure:\nRemove the supernatant using a p1000 micropipette.\nBriefly centrifuge to collect all residual supernatant at the bottom of the tube. At this point, the pellet should be on the side of the tube.\nUsing a p200 micropipette, gently push at the bottom-center of the tube and remove all residual ethanol. Always check that the pellet is not entering the tip.\nBriefly air dry the pellet.\nCritical: do not over-dry the RNA pellet as this would make it difficult to resuspend it.\nRNA fragmentation\nTiming: 8 min\nResuspend the RNA pellet from the previous step 29 in 8 μL water.\nPause point: RNA can be stored at −80°C for up to a week.\nNote: The analysis of RNA quality/integrity is not required at this step. This is because degradation fragments cannot be cloned with the library preparation strategy described in this protocol. Only RNA molecules with 3′-hydroxyl biotinylated ends will be suitable for cloning. In addition, the RNA quality control methods will primarily detect mature mRNAs and not Polymerase-bound nascent RNAs, which are much less abundant.\nAdd 2 μL of 5× reverse transcriptase buffer (provided with SuperScript™ IV Reverse Transcriptase) and mix it well by pipetting or vortexing. Spin down the samples using a benchtop centrifuge.\nNote: RNA fragmentation can be performed using different buffers, including commercially available RNA fragmentation reagents, based on MgCl2 or ZnCl2. If using a different buffer, check that the final library size is correct and adjust the fragmentation time accordingly.\nIncubate the samples at 95°C for 7 min.",
    "Note: incubation can be performed in a ThermoMixer equipped with Thermo Top. Alternatively, the sample can be transferred to a PCR tube and incubated in a thermocycler with the lid temperature set at 105°C. During the fragmentation time, it is possible to start preparing the Dynabeads magnetic beads to isolate biotinylated molecules.\nImmediately block fragmentation by shifting the samples on ice.\nAdd 50 μL of ice-cold nuclease-free water and keep on ice for at least 1 min before proceeding to the next step.\nPreparation of dynabeads MyOne streptavidin C1\nTiming: 10 min\nDynabeads are washed following the manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Fdynabeads_myone_savC1_man.pdf] before binding to biotinylated RNA.\nCritical: This step is crucial since the beads are not supplied in RNase-free solutions.\nNote: all the washing steps are performed at room temperature (20°C–25˚C) unless stated differently.\nResuspend the Dynabeads™ magne/tic beads in the vial (i.e., vortex for >30 s, or tilt and rotate for 5 min).\nTransfer 30 μL of Dynabeads™ magnetic beads per sample to a low binding microcentrifuge tube.\nNote: 30 μL of beads are sufficient for a sample of 1,000 to 40,000 adult worms or 40,000 to 300,000 embryos. If performing the experiment with a different number of worms/embryos, the volume of beads should be scaled accordingly.\nAdd 1 mL of Binding & Washing Buffer 1× and resuspend by pipetting or gentle vortexing for 5–10 s. Then, briefly centrifuge the tube using a benchtop centrifuge.\nPlace the tube on a magnet for 1 mi/n or until the solution appears clear and discard the supernatant.",
    "Remove the tube from the magnet and resuspend the magnetic beads in a Binding & Washing Buffer volume 1× equal to the initial volume of beads taken from the vial at step 36. Resuspend beads by pipetting or gentle vortexing for 5–10 s. Then, briefly centrifuge the tube using a benchtop centrifuge.\nPlace the tube on a magnetic stand for 1 min or until the solution appears clear and discard the supernatant.\nRepeat steps 39–40 twice for a total of 3 washes.\nWash the beads twice in Solution A for 2 min. Use a volume of Solution A equal to or larger than the initial volume of Dynabeads™ magnetic beads initially taken from the vial.\nWash the beads once in Solution B. Use a volume of Solution B equal to the volume used for Solution A.\nResuspend the beads in 60 μL per sample of 2× Binding & Washing Buffer.\nNote: The washed beads can be prepared in advance and stored at 4°C for 1 day.\n1st enrichment of biotinylated RNA molecules\nTiming: 50 min\nBiotinylated nascent RNAs are enriched by binding to Dynabeads™ magnetic beads. After binding, the beads coated with the biotinylated molecules are washed using high salt buffers to efficiently remove non-biotinylated molecules.\nAdd 60 μL of washed beads from previous step 44 to 60 μL of fragmented RNA from previous step 34.\nIncubate for 30 min at 25°C with 1200 rpm agitation (15’’ ON 45” OFF) in a ThermoMixer.\nBriefly spin the tubes using a benchtop centrifuge and place on a magnetic rack for 1 min or until the solution appears clear.\nRemove the supernatant and add 1 mL of High salt buffer. Incubate on rotation for 5 min at 4°C.",

Therefore, with the following steps, 5′-hydroxyl ends are phosphorylated using the Polynucleotide kinase.\nNote: Since incorporating Bio-11-UTP stall RNA polymerases, all nascent RNAs should terminate with a 3′-hydroxyl biotinylated end. Therefore, RNA molecules terminating with a 3′-phosphate end, result from the fragmentation steps and represent the background for this protocol. For this reason, 3′-phosphate ends do not need to be repaired to allow ligation of the adapter.\nResuspend RNA after TRIzol purification in 20 μL water.\nPause point: RNA can be stored at −80°C for up to a week.\nSetup RNA 5′ phosphorylation reaction in 100 μL final volume by adding to the RNA from the previous step:\n10 μL 10× Polynucleotide Kinase Buffer(\n1 μL 100 mM ATP",

Always handle in a chemical hood. Contact with eyes and skin should be avoided.\nCentrifuge at 12,000×g for 5 min at room temperature (20°C–25˚C) and transfer the aqueous phase containing the RNA (upper phase) to a fresh low binding microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 30 μL of 3 M sodium acetate and 2 μL of GlycoBlue and vortex for 5–10 s.\nAdd 900 μL ethanol and vortex vigorously for 10–15 s.\nPrecipitate the RNA by incubating for 1h at −20°C.\nPause point: RNA can be precipitated overnight or over-weekend.\nCentrifuge to pellet the RNA at 12,000×g for 30 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and add 1 mL of 75 % Ethanol to the RNA pellet.\nNote: After centrifugation, a blue pellet should be visible at the bottom of the tube.\nCritical: Carefully remove the supernatant without disturbing the RNA pellet.\nCentrifuge at 12,000×g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and air dry the pellet for 1–2 min.\nCritical: do not over-dry the RNA pellet as this would make it difficult to resuspend it.\nResuspend the RNA in 5 μL water.",

    "The number of amplification cycles required to amplify the libraries is influenced by many factors and needs to be determined experimentally for each sample (for example, very early embryos have lower transcription levels than late embryos). Therefore, we suggest performing a test PCR amplification of the libraries using ¼ of the reverse transcription reaction.\nCritical: The number of PCR cycles should be minimized to avoid overamplification, which increases PCR artifacts.
