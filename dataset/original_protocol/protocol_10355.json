    "Note: The chemicals are used as received. Linear RGD is purchased, but it can be prepared by standard Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis16,19. Solvents are of analytical grade. The dialysis requires the use of membrane with a Mw cut-off equal to 3,500 Da. The synthesized compounds are characterized by 1H NMR spectra recorded on a 400 MHz spectrometer using chloroform (CDCl3) or deuterium oxide (D2O) as solvents, and chemical shifts are reported as δ values in parts per million. Furthermore, hydrogels are subjected to FT-IR analysis using KBr pellet technique and their physical characterization involves gelation studies assessed using the inverted test tube at 37 °C.\n1.

Press the powder using a manual laboratory press: for 3 min at pressure capacity equal to 5 tons and then for 3 min at pressure capacity of 10 tons.\nRelease the pressure to obtain the final pellet as homogeneous and transparent in appearance.
