    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMuscle dissection and digestion to obtain muscle tissue-derived cell mixture\nTiming: 3–4 h\nThe first 21 steps describe the isolation of murine MuSCs from injured hind-limb muscles. If you plan to utilize an alternate purified stem cell population, proceed to steps 22. We have applied the CUT&Tag technique to human CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) isolated from cord blood using a purification protocol that we have previously detailed (Palii et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]). For murine MuSCs, please proceed from step 1.\nEuthanize the mice using CO2 chamber, and sterilize the mice with 70% ethanol.\nIsolate the CTX-injured TA and gastroc muscles. The two TA muscles and two gastroc muscles from one mouse can be pooled as one muscle sample from a mouse. You can then proceed to work in a BSL-2 (Biosafety level 2) tissue culture hood for MuSC isolation to maintain sterility.\nPut the muscles from one mouse in a 10 cm dish and add 15 mL PBS pre-warmed to 37°C. Rinse the muscles in the dish. Transfer the muscles to a new 10 cm dish containing at least 15 mL of PBS pre-warmed to 37°C. Rinse the muscles again in the dish.\nTransfer the muscles into a new 6 cm dish with PBS (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A). Aspirate PBS. Mince the muscle sample into ∼1 mm3 pieces using dissection scissors (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/950-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Isolation and digestion of damaged TA and Gastroc muscle\n(A) Freshly isolated TA and gastroc muscles; (B) minced muscle tissue; (C) tissue prior to Collagenase/Dispase treatment; (D) tissue after Collagenase/Dispase treatment; and (E) dissociated muscle tissue.\nNote: The following steps are an example of pooling the muscles from one mouse into a single sample.",
    "Add Collagenase I/Dispase II solution to the 6 cm dish containing the minced muscle. The muscle sample obtained from one mouse requires at least 4 mL Collagenase I/Dispase II solution for thorough digestion (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]C) (If pooling the samples from 2 or 3 mice, the mincing and digestion of the muscle samples can be performed in a 10 cm dish, and the amount of Collagenase I/Dispase II solution needs to be scaled up to 8 mL or 12 mL, respectively).\nIncubate the 6 cm dish containing minced muscle pieces in Collagenase I/Dispase II solution in the cell culture incubator at 37°C for 1 h. During the digestion period, shake the dish every 15 min to ensure the Collagenase I/Dispase II solution fully contacts the muscle pieces and facilitates thorough digestion.\nWhile waiting for the muscle digestion, coat the pipets, 50 mL conical tubes, and strainers (both 100 μm and 40 μm strainers) with Bovine Growth Serum/Calf Serum (BGS).\nCritical: All the pipets, conical tubes, and strainers that will directly contact the digested sample MUST be coated with BGS. Pipets can be coated by aspirating the BGS up to the full capacity of the pipets and then flushing out. Repeat this coating process two more times. For coating conical tubes, adding 5 mL BGS into a 50 mL conical tubes, rock and invert the tubes to ensure the BGS has contacted the entire inner surface of the tube. To coat the strainers, place a strainer onto a 50 mL conical tube and flush BGS onto the strainer to ensure the BGS has contacted the entire surface of the strainer. Skipping the coating of any surfaces that comes in direct contact with the digested samples will significantly reduce the final MuSC yield.",
    "After 1 h of digestion (see Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]D), use the BGS-coated pipets to triturate the muscle pieces by pipetting up and down several times til a homogeneous mixture is generated in the dish. No visible clumps of muscle are observed at this point (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]E). Put the dish back into the incubator for 5–10 min.\nAdd 5 mL BGS into the digested sample and mix by pipetting. Adding of BGS will dilute the collagenase I and stop tissue digestion.\nUse a 100 μm strainer to strain the digested muscle sample into a 50 mL conical tube.\nRinse the 6 cm dish where the digestion took place with PBS (heated to 37°C) to collect the residual cells in the dish and run the PBS through the strainer. Repeat this rinsing step one or two times more to ensure all cells in the digestion dish have been collected and run through the strainer into the 50 mL conical tube.\nUsing a 40 μm strainer, filter the 100 μm-strained sample into a new 50 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge the 40 μm-strained sample in 50 mL conical tube at 300 × g for 10 min at room temperature.\nThe pellet will be red due to the presence of red blood cells (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A). Carefully aspirate the supernatant and add 500 μL of red blood cell lysis buffer onto the pellet within the 50 mL conical tube. Pipet up and down to resuspend the pellet. Wait for 1 min and add 10 mL FACS buffer into the 50 mL conical tube. Rock to mix and centrifuge at 300×g for 7 min at room temperature. The red color of the pellet should be significantly lighter due to the lysis of most red blood cells (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/950-Fig8.jpg",
    "Figure 8. Removal of red blood cells by applying red blood cell lysis buffer\n(A) Cell pellet before red cell lysis.\n(B) Cell pellet after red cell lysis.\nNote: We notice that lysing the red blood cells as described in step 14 is not able to completely remove the red color of the pellet, indicating there are residual red blood cells within the pellet. However, since the majority of the red blood cells are lysed, repeating step 14 for the purpose of thoroughly removing red blood cells is NOT recommended. We found that the residual red blood cells do not interfere with FACS sorting of MuSCs. Also, repeating step 14 may unnecessarily stress the cells.\nCarefully remove the supernatant, resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of FACS buffer and transfer the sample to a microcentrifuge tube. This 1 mL of FACS buffer contains the muscle tissue-derived cell mixture, which contains multiple cell types including MuSCs. If the mouse strain used has a Pax7-driven fluorescent reporter (e.g., Pax7gCre/gCre TdTFl/Fl strain of this study), then TdTomato fluorescent reporter such as tdTomato can be used to indicate and sort MuSCs by FACS. (However, If the mouse strain does not have a fluorescent reporter which is specifically expressed in the Pax7+ cells, then the muscle tissue derived cell mixture needs to be stained with a combination of cell surface marker antibodies for FACS sorting MuSCs. For this purpose, skip to step 18 and continue.).\nFACS of muscle tissue-derived cells to isolate MuSCs\nTiming: 2–3 h",
    "Filter the 1 mL muscle tissue-derived cell mixture into a 5-mL Polypropylene round bottom FACS tube using CellTrics 50 μm filters. Bring up the sample volume to 4 mL by passing 1 mL of FACS buffer through the CellTrics filter. Now add 2 mL of FACS buffer to the tube. Note that myoblasts that don’t express TdTomato should be prepared in parallel to use as a control for gating TdTomato- and TdTomato+ populations.\nPlace the sample on ice and add SYTOX™ Green nucleic acid stain (final concentration in the sample: 10 nM) into the sample to stain dead cells. Now this muscle-derived cell mixture sample is ready for FACS. Sorted MuSCs are collected in a microcentrifuge tube containing 300–400 μL FACS buffer without EDTA. In this case, the Sytox Green-/TdTomato+ cells are sorted and collected as live MuSCs (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]A). Up to 60,000 live Sytox Green-/TdTomato+ MuSCs can be obtained from the damaged TA and gastroc muscles of one mouse.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/950-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. FACS of MuSCs\n(A) FACS plot of live MuSCs isolation based on TdTomato expression and exclusion of Sytox Green.\n(B) FACS plot of live MuSCs isolation based on Itga7 expression and exclusion of lineage markers CD31/CD45/Sca1.",
    "If the mouse strain does not have a MuSC specific fluorescent reporter which is uniquely expressed in the Pax7+ cells, then the muscle tissue-derived cell mixture can be stained with cell surface marker antibodies for MuSCs sorting. Here we showed one such representative FACS sorting of MuSCs using biotinylated CD31/CD45/Sca1 antibodies and Alexa-647 conjugated α7-integrin (Itga7) antibody. For this, add the cell surface marker antibodies to 1 mL FACS buffer containing the cell mixture (See step 15). Incubate on the rotator at 4°C for 30 min (protected from light), and then spin down the cells at 300×g for 10 min. Discard the supernatant.\nNow, resuspend the cell mixture with 500 μL FACS buffer and add 5 μL Streptavidin-PE and incubate on a rotator at room temperature for 5 min (protected from light). Spin down the cells at 300×g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the loose pellet in 200 μL of FACS buffer. To label dead cells, add 10 μL of 7-AAD and incubate on ice protected from light for 2 min.",
    "Dilute the cell mixture by adding 800 μL FACS buffer and filter the cell mixture through CellTrics 50 μm filters and bring up the sample volume to 4 mL by passing 1 mL of FACS buffer through the filter and then by adding 2 mL FACS buffer into the tube. Place the sample on ice and proceed for FACS sorting. Sorted MuSCs can be collected in a microcentrifuge tube containing 300–400 μL FACS buffer without EDTA. In this case, the 7-AAD-/CD31-/CD45-/Sca1-/Itga7+ cells are sorted and collected as MuSCs (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]B). The damaged TA and gastroc muscles from one mouse can readily generate 60,000 to 100,000 7-AAD-/CD31-/CD45-/Sca1-/Itga7+ MuSCs. Vcam1 can also be added to the antibody panel in step 18 as another positive marker for MuSCs. PE/Cyanine7 anti-mouse Vcam1 antibody is recommended (Liu et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]) for this purpose.\nCritical: EDTA should be avoided in the buffer used to collect FACS-sorted MuSCs. The residual EDTA in the buffer can interfere with cell binding to Concanavalin A.\nCUT&Tag on isolated MuSCs\nTiming: 2 days",
    "For efficient binding, we recommend incubating 50,000 MuSCs with 20 μL of BioMag®Plus Concanavalin A bead solution in a microcentrifuge tube for one CUT&Tag reaction. Muscle tissue (2 TA and 2 gastroc muscles) from one mouse at 30 h post-injury should generate around 60,000 live MuSCs, an amount sufficient for one CUT&Tag reaction. Using antibodies targeting histone modifications (e.g., H3K4me3), we have successfully performed CUT&Tag assay with MuSC numbers as low as 25,000 cells for one CUT&Tag reaction. However, we recommend using 50,000 MuSCs per CUT&Tag reaction when examining less abundant histone marks or transcription factors. Importantly, while comparing the genome-wide histone and transcription factor binding profiles across the samples, it is crucial to maintain the same number of cells for unambiguous normalization. If one experiemental condition (for instance the knockout mouse) resulted in sorting 25,000 MuSCs, same number of cells should be used across all the conditions (for instance the wild type mouse) being tested, for a given antibody. Notably, to obtain sufficient number of cells, and to examine multiple different binding profiles for histone marks and/or transcription factors, muscles dissected from more than one mouse (same genotype and treatment) can be pooled and FACS-sorted before separating into distinct 50,000-cell CUT&Tag reactions. In this case, both the volume of Collagenase I/Dispase II solution used for digestion of muscle tissue and the quantity of antibodies used FACS sorting MuSCs should be scaled accordingly.\nFor calculating the number of CUT&Tag reactions, determine how many different types of histone modifications or transcription factor profiles will be studied for one sample. For instance, if you are interested in characterizing two histone modifications, in duplicate reactions, then four CUT&Tag reactions will be performed for one sample.",
    "Before aliquoting Concanavalin A bead solution from the main stock bottle, shake or invert the bottle several times to thoroughly mix the contents of the bottle to obtain a uniform slurry. In this protocol, we describe running 4 reactions using 200,000 MuSCs as an example. Aspirate 90 μL (20 μL for one CUT&Tag reaction plus 10 μL to account for pipetting loss) of BioMag®Plus Concanavalin A bead solution into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing 850 μL Binding buffer.\nMix the binding buffer with Concanavalin A beads in the 1.5 mL tube by mild-pipetting or by inverting and tapping. Place on a magnetic rack and let it sit for 2 min to be clear.\nWithdraw the buffer and then remove the tube from the magnetic rack. Add 800 μL Binding buffer into tube and completely resuspend the beads by mild-pipetting or by inverting and tapping. Place the tube on magnetic rack and let it sit for 2 min to be clear.\nRemove the liquid completely and take the tube off the magnetic rack. Resuspend the beads in 90 μL of Binding buffer. Thus prepared beads can be kept at 22°C until the MuSCs are ready. The preparation of beads can be started when FACS sorting of MuSCs is about to finish.\nSpin down the microcentrifuge tube containing FACS-sorted MuSCs (from step 17 or step 21) at 600×g for 5 min at 22°C.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant. Caution must be exercised not to touch or aspirate the cell pellet. If the sample is to be used for four CUT&Tag reactions, then it should contain at least 200,000 MuSCs to ensure each reaction is allocated 50,000 cells.",
    "Resuspend the cell pellet with 750 μL of Wash buffer. While gently vortexing the tube containing the cells, add the 90 μL of Concanavalin A bead slurry (Prepared in step 26) dropwise. Place the tube containing cell-bead mixture on an end-to-end rotator at 22°C for 15 min.\nAfter 15 min, place the microcentrifuge tube on a magnetic rack and let it sit for 2 min to be clear. Transfer the liquid (“supernatant”) to a new microcentrifuge tube. Proceed with the Concanavalin A beads-MuSCs cell mixture to step 31.\nTo check the binding of MuSCs to the Concanavalin A beads, drop 5–10 μL of the supernatant into one of the chambers of a hemocytometer and observe under the microscope for cells. In most cases, Concanavalin A beads bind all the cells quickly and efficiently (there should not be any visible cells left in the supernatant).\nCritical: Note that the MuSCs should not be kept in wash buffer for extended periods of time, and should be quickly advanced to step 31. If processing a large number of different antibodies, it is suggested that binding of MuSCs to Concanavalin A beads be performed sequentially where the cells needed for each antibody are processed through steps 29 and 30 sequentially. In rare cases, the residual amounts of EDTA in FACS buffer may interfere with Concanavalin A bead binding to the cells. This is the reason we highly recommend FACS buffer without EDTA while collecting MuSCs during FACS. Collecting cells in FACS buffer containing EDTA needs extra pelleting and resuspending steps to completely remove EDTA and this might lead to MuSC loss.",
    "If the supernatant is clear without any cells, resuspend the cell-bead complex in 450 μL antibody buffer and split into four 1.5 mL Axygen MCT-150-C microcentrifuge tubes (100 μL in each tube). Each tube represents a single CUT&Tag reaction. Here, we recommend Axygen MCT-150-C microtubes to be used from primary antibody incubation step, because cell-bead mixture is less sticky to the inner walls of this type of tubes.\nFor each CUT&Tag reaction, dilute the primary antibody in 100 μL antibody buffer at a concentration that is double the working concentration normally required for immunofluorescence microscopy studies. This way after adding the 100 μL antibody into the microcentrifuge tubes already containing 100 μL cell-bead mixture, the final concentration of the diluted antibody in the tube will be equivalent to the working concentration used in immunofluorescence.\nPlace the tubes on a nutator at 4°C and let it agitate overnight.\nNext day, in order to remove beads from the cap and walls, flick or briefly spin the tubes and place them on a magnetic rack. Wait for 2 min and remove the primary antibody liquid.\nAdd 200 μL of Digitonin-wash buffer containing the secondary antibody onto the beads. The dilution of secondary antibody is 1:100. Remove the tubes from the magnetic rack, vortex mildly at 300 rpm. Nutate the tubes at 22°C for 1 h.\nFlick or briefly spin the tubes and place them on a magnetic rack. Wait for 2 min and remove the liquid containing the secondary antibody.",
    "Wash the cell-bead mixture by adding 200 μL of Digitonin-wash buffer into each tube. Close the caps, remove the tubes from the magnetic rack and invert 20 times. Quick spin to remove liquid from cap. Place the tubes back onto the magnetic rack and wait for 2 min. Remove the Digitonin-wash buffer from the tubes.\nRepeat step 37 one more time.\nDilute the pA-Tn5 fusion protein (with adaptors loaded, see before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] section) to 1:250 using Digitonin-300 wash buffer (Final concentration is 4.74 μM∗1/250 = 18.96 nM). Add 100 μL of this diluted pA-Tn5 fusion protein into each tube. Remove the tubes from the magnetic rack and nutate for 1 h at 22°C.\nFlick or briefly spin the tubes and place them back on the magnetic rack. Wait for 2 min, and remove the pA-Tn5 containing liquid.\nTo further remove unbound/excess pA-Tn5, wash the cell-bead mixture by adding 800 μL of Digitonin-300 wash buffer to each tube. Close the caps, remove the tubes from the magnetic rack and invert the tubes 10–20 times. Quick spin to remove liquid from cap. Place the tubes back onto the magnetic rack and wait for 2 min. Remove the Digitonin-300 wash buffer from the tubes.\nRepeat step 41 twice for a total of three washes using Digitonin-300 wash buffer.\nAdd 300μL Tagmentation buffer containing Spike-inAmpR (0.1899 amol/L) to each CUT&Tag reaction tube. Invert or tap the tubes to mix well. Incubate at 37°C for 1 h. Note the addition of the Spike-inAmpR is optional.\nTo each tube, add 10 μL of 0.5 M EDTA, 3 μL 10% SDS and 2.5 μL 20 mg/mL Proteinase K. Vortex to mix and incubate at 37°C overnight. Incubation can be shortened to 1 h at 55°C.",
    "Pause point: After step 44, the samples can be frozen at −80°C. While proceeding to the following steps, just thaw the samples at 4°C and proceed to step 45.\nAdd 300 μL of Phenol/Chloroform into each tube, vortex thoroughly. Now transfer the contents to a freshly labeled phase lock tube (Qiagen) and centrifuge at 16,000×g in a benchtop centrifuge for 5 min. Transfer the aqueous layer to a new labeled microcentrifuge tube. The microcentrifuge tubes used from here onwards are not necessarily Axygen MCT-150-C microcentrifuge tubes.\nCaution: Phenol/Chloroform is toxic and should be handled in a fume hood.\nAdd 300 μL of chloroform into each new tube and invert to mix thoroughly. Spin the tubes at 16,000×g in a benchtop centrifuge for 5 min. Transfer the aqueous layer to a fresh new tube. Label the new tubes accordingly and properly.\nAdd 1 μL of 20 mg/mL glycogen solution into each tube and vortex. Now, add 750 μL of 100% ethanol into each tube. Invert several times and place at −80°C to precipitate the tagmented DNA. Note that the addition of glycogen is optional. In our hands, this concentration of glycogen delayed PCR amplification by two cycles, but has the added benefit of being able to see the precipitated material.\nPause point: After step 47, the samples can be stored at −80°C. When continuing to the following steps, thaw the samples at 4°C and proceed to step 48.",
    "Thaw samples on ice, spin the microcentrifuge tubes at max-speed for 15 min using a benchtop centrifuge at 4°C. The glycogen/DNA will form a visible pellet at the bottom of each tube. If no pellet is visible, check to ensure your stock solution of glycogen is correct. Note that if you choose not to add glycogen during the precipitation step, proceed without being able to see a visible pellet.\nCarefully pour off the liquid and add 1 mL of 100% ethanol into each tube. Invert several times to wash the pellet. Spin the tubes again at 18,000×g for 10 min in a benchtop microcentrifuge.\nCarefully pour off the ethanol from the tubes. Wipe off the residual ethanol from the cap and edge of the tubes using a piece of Kimwipes and then completely dry the tubes in a fume hood with caps open to remove any residual ethanol.\nWhen the tubes and pellets are dry, add 25 μL CUT&Tag DNA resuspension Buffer into each tube and incubate at 37°C for 10 min to dissolve the pellet. We recommend keeping the dissolved CUT&Tagged genomic DNA on ice and perform library preparation within 2–3 h. Avoid freeze-thawing the tagmented genomic DNA samples before making the libraries.\nLibrary preparation\nTiming: 2 h\nOne CUT&Tag reaction will generate a library of 50 μL in volume after PCR reaction. For most histone marks or transcription factors, we target 10 million reads per sample, and combine up to 40 CUT&Tag samples in the same sequencing lane of 350–400 M reads. Before setting up the PCR reaction to make the sequencing libraries, aliquot 2 μL from each CUT&Tagged genomic DNA sample (obtained in step 51). Set up a qPCR to determine the number of cycles required during actual library preparation to obtain sufficient material for sequencing.",
    "Dilute the Spike-inAmpR fragment to a concentration of 65.6 nM. This will be used as standard DNA in qPCR.\nSet up the qPCR on AmpR gene fragment using the following conditions:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_950_20.csv\nIn this 25 μL qPCR system, the concentration of the Spike-inAmpR fragment is known: 65.6 nM × (2/25) = 5.25 nM. This is the standard qPCR reaction.\nSet up the qPCR on each of the aliquoted 2 μL CUT&Tagged genomic DNA sample (obtained in step 51) using the following conditions:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_950_21.csv\nRun the standard qPCR reaction (Set up in step 53.) along with CUT&Tagged genomic DNA samples (Set up in step 54.) using the following cycling parameters:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_950_22.csv\nCritical: Record the cycle numbers required by each sample to reach a fluorescence intensity equivalent to that observe in the Spike-inAmpR control at 5 cycles – when the Spike-inAmpR fragment reaches 168 nM (5.25nM ∗ 25 = 168 nM). This will provide an approximation on the number of cycles needed to amplify samples to 168 nM.\nCritical: Here we recommended a qPCR method to obtain a concentration of approximately 168 nM for each CUT&Tag library. However, it is not necessary that every single CUT&Tag library reaches this concentration when pooling up to 30–40 CUT&Tag libraries into one lane of sequencing. For instance, your IgG control should not amplify to 168 nM. However, the IgG control should be amplified for the same number of cycles determined to amplify the antibody-specific sample to 168 nM. During sequencing, the libraries that attained higher than 168 nM concentration can compensate for the lower DNA concentration in some of the samples (control or knockout libraries).",
    "Critical: It is essential that the same number of PCR cycles be used for samples that will be compared (i.e. H3K4me3 CUT&Tag in a wild type versus knockout should be amplified to give 168 nM in the wild type conditions, and the same number of PCR cycles should be used in the knockout). For samples that will not be compared quantitatively (i.e. different antibodies such as H3K4me3 and H3K4me1 ), each sample can be made into a library as per the optimal number of PCR cycles determined, for ensuring the WT is amplified to 168 nM.\nSet up the actual library preparation using 20 μL of each CUT&Tagged genomic DNA sample (obtained in step 51). The library preparation PCR conditions are as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_950_23.csv\nUse the following PCR cycling setup to perform actual library preparation:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_950_24.csv\n∗Optimal number of cycles for the “Denaturation” and “Annealing and extension” steps is determined at step 55 and should be adapted here. As mentioned in Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10] legend, during the actual library preparation step, the starting concentration of the CUT&Tagged genomic DNA sample is 5 times to that of the starting concentration in the qPCR system in step 54. So, the optimized cycle numbers obtained in step 55 should be reduced by 2 cycles for actual library preparation PCR.",
    "Critical: To distinguish different samples which are sequenced in the same lane, different i5 and/or i7 primers should be used for each sample. We recommend 12 different i7 primers (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) and 8 different i5 primers (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]). This can generate a combination of 8 X 12 = 96, which is sufficient to distinguish 30–40 samples pooled in one lane as mentioned above. Notably, in the preliminary qPCR setup in steps 53 and 54 used to determine approximate concentrations, distinguishing i5 or i7 primers for each sample are not required as the products of these qPCR reactions are not for sequencing purpose. Instead these qPCR reactions are solely for optimizing/obtaining the cycle numbers required during actual library preparation step.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_950_25.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_950_26.csv\nAfter libraries are made, 3–5 μL of the library (50 μL in total) can be aliquoted, purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit and eluted in 40 μL of H2O. Before sequencing, this small fraction of purified library allows for qPCR diagnosis by using some locus-specific primers to primarily test whether the CUT&Tag assay has yielded antibody targeted enrichment of protein bound regions. IgG can be used as the negative control. As a positive control, we recommend using H3K4me3 antibody (Millipore) as we found H3K4me3 is abundant in activated MuSCs and can be readily detected specifically at promoter regions of active genes, including housekeeping genes. Accordingly, primers binding active genes in MuSCs such as Gapdh locus (Forward: 5′-3′ CTCTGAGCCTCCTCCAATTC; Reverse: 5′-3′ GCTACGCCATAGGTCAGGAT) can be used for qPCR. The sequences of the primers for amplifying a mouse gene-desert region are also provided here: Forward: 5′-3′ TCCTCCCCATCTGTGTCATC; Reverse: 5′-3′ GGATCCATCACCATCAATAACC. The qPCR can be set up using the following conditions:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_950_27.csv",
    "As an indicator of successful CUT&Tag assay, the amplification of Gapdh locus in H3K4me3 CUT&Tag sample should be at least 3 cycles ahead of the amplification of this locus in the IgG sample. Also, the gene-desert primer should not amplify significantly more tagmented DNA from the H3K4me3 antibody sample compared to the IgG antibody sample.\nTo further clean up the library for sequencing, mix 45 μL of PCR-prepared library (obtained in step 57) with 63 μL Kapa Pure beads (Roche) in an Axygen microcentrifuge tube. Pipette few times to get this fully mixed.\nQuickly spin down the mixture and keep at room temperature for 10 min.\nPlace the microcentrifuge tube on a magnetic rack and wait till clear. Withdraw the liquid from the tubes and avoid disturbing the beads.\nWash twice by adding 200 μL 80% ethanol in the tube. Returning the tube to the magnetic rack and withdraw the liquid from the tube.\nRemove the residual liquid from the tube by pipetting.\nWait for 5 min to dry the beads.\nRemove the tubes from magnetic rack and add 21 μL of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) to the tube. Vortex to fully mix.\nWait for 5 min and put the tubes back onto the magnetic rack.\nWait till clear and transfer the liquid to a fresh tube. The liquid contains the cleaned-up DNA for sequencing.\nSample concentration is first quantified using a Qubit™ 1× dsDNA HS Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as per manufacturer’s guide and adjusted to 4 ng/μL (using 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8) for dilution.",
    "The quality of the tagmented DNA library is then assessed using Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Analysis (Agilent). A sample dilution at 2 ng/μL is loaded on the Chip when possible. If the sample concentration is below 2 ng/μL, load the sample undiluted. The library size can be determined using the average size value for a region between 170 bp to 1000 bp. Examples of successful CUT&Tag DNA samples profiled by bioanalyzer analysis are shown in Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]. The histone mark samples are enriched for slightly bigger DNA fragments in which the average length is ∼350 bp, whereas for the transcription factor CUT&Tag samples are enriched for smaller fragments that start from 200 bp.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/950-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10.

    "The red horizontal line indicates the targeted intensity of fluorescence when Spike-inAmpR (Standard DNA) reached 168 nM (5 cycles). For the group of samples a, b, and c (3 conditions with the same antibody), amplification for average 13 cycles is required to reach the level of the red horizontal line, whereas Samples d, e, and f (3 conditions with a different antibody) requires approximately 19 cycles to reach the level indicated by the red horizontal line. This test qPCR is set up using 2 μL of each CUT&Tagged genomic DNA sample in a 25 μL qPCR reaction where as the actual CUT&Tag library will be generated with 20 μL of each CUT&Tagged genomic DNA sample in a 50-μL reaction (i.e., 5× more DNA). As the library prepapration will be performed with 5× higher concentration of DNA, an amplification of the DNA to 168 nM should be achieved approximately 2 cycles earlier (log25 ≈ 2.3). As a result, Sample a, b, and c require 13 - 2 = 11 cycles to reach 168 nM while Sample d, e, and f require 17 cycles (19-2) for library prep.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/950-Fig11.jpg\nFigure 11. Bioanalyzer profiling of the tagmented DNA of CUT&Tag libraries\nThe final sample concentration for sequencing is then determined using NEBNext® Library Quant Kit for Illumina (NEB[href=https://www.neb.ca/neb_protocols.php?p=protocols/2015/05/14/nebnext-library-quant-kit-quick-protocol-e7630]) and run as per manufacturer’s protocol.\nSamples are then pooled and sequenced on NovaSeq 6000 (or equivalent platform) using 50 bp Paired-End sequencing at ∼10 M / sample. We use a S1 flowcell on an XP workflow but it can be sequenced on any flowcell (SP, S1, S2 and S4) and on any workflow (standard or regular).\nData analyses after sequencing\nTiming: ∼4 h",
    "A pipeline has been established in Github for users to analyze their CUT&Tag sequencing data (https://github.com/dilworthlab/CnT_pipeline_snakemake[href=https://github.com/dilworthlab/CnT_pipeline_snakemake]). This pipeline includes normalization of samples using Spike-inAmpR as the default. An overview of this pipeline is provided in Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]. This pipeline allows for: 1) Quality Control of Raw FASTQ reads; 2) Adapter trimming; 3) Alignment (primary genome and spike-in sequences) ; 4) Post-Alignment filtering; 5) Spike-in normalization; and 6) Peak calling.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/950-Fig12.jpg\nFigure 12. An overview of the pipeline of the analyses on the raw reads of CUT&Tag DNA sequencing\nThe dotted arrows represent valid alternate paths within the pipeline where duplicates are not removed – this is not the preferred path.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/950-Fig13.jpg\nFigure 13. FastQC report showing failed modules that are characteristic of a typical CUT&Tag library\n(A–C) (A) Per base sequence content, (B) Sequence duplication levels, and (C) Overrepresented sequences.\nPrepare the software environment and download the data.\nInstall required software. A Linux-based High-Performance computing (HPC) environment is ideal for this analysis. To install the following software, set up a virtual environment within the HPC and install the required versions. 1) FastQC v0.11.9 (Babraham Bioinformatics, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]); MultiQC >=1.9 (Ewels et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]); Cutadapt >=2.6 (Martin, 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]), Bowtie2 >=2.4.1 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]); Samtools >=1.11 (Li et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]); Picard Tools >= 2.22.5[href=https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/releases/tag/2.22.5] (Broad Institute); deepTools >=3.3.2 (Ramirez et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]) ; SEACR >=1.3 (Meers et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]); BEDtools >= 2.29.2 (Quinlan and Hall, 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]); bedToBigBed >= 2.7(Kent et al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]); and ChIPseeker >= 1.24.0 (Yu et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]). A virtual environment can be set up using Conda. Conda is a convenient package management system that is included with Anaconda or Miniconda. For more information on usage documentation for condo can be consulted.",
    "Download the Data. Download raw FASTQ reads to desired location and perform md5sum checks to verify the integrity of all files. With paired-end sequencing, there should be two reads (i.e., R1 and R2) per sample. For simplicity, from here onwards, these two reads can be referred to as “R1” and “R2”. Sample_R1.fastq.gz - ${R1} Sample_R2.fastq.gz - ${R2}\nQuality control. Preliminary quality control checks are performed on raw FASTQ reads by running FastQC on each read individually. For more detailed information on the type of checks the tool performs, refer the documentation for FastQC. fastqc ${R1} fastqc ${R2} Typically, with CUT&Tag libraries, the raw reads do not always pass all QC modules (Figure 13[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig13]) defined by FastQC (i.e., duplicates, overrepresented sequences, or mapped reads). This, however is not necesssarily indicative of an unusable library and hence you should proceed with further analysis. A fail in the “per base sequence quality” score would suggest that the library is not of good quality and needs to be re-made.\nPer base sequence content Reads from CUT&Tag libraries usually display a non-uniform base composition at the start of the read. This is due to the sequence bias exhibited by Tn5 during transposition (Viswanadham et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]).\nSequence duplication levels Since a CUT&Tag library has low complexity, the level of duplication of enriched regions is expected to be higher than for typical libraries. (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/8%20Duplicate%20Sequences.html[href=https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/8%20Duplicate%20Sequences.html])\nOverrepresented sequences\nNot always, but sometimes there are overrepresented sequences in the library due to contaminants. These warnings can be ignored as they do not affect any of the subsequent steps.\nAdaptor trimming. Illumina Nextera adaptors are trimmed from reads using Cutadapt in paired-end mode. The resulting trimmed reads are referred to as Trim.R1 and Trim.R2 respectively.\ncutadapt -a CTGTCTCTTATACACATCT -A CTGTCTCTTATACACATCT \\\n-o $[Trim.R1] -p ${Trim.R2} ${R1} ${R2}",
    "Alignment. After preliminary quality control and adaptor trimming, paired-end reads are aligned to both the Mus musculus (or Homo sapiens) genome and spike-in sequence using Bowtie2. The Bowtie2 output containing sequence alignment information is in SAM (Sequence Alignment Map) format. This format is however, bypassed by piping the output directly to Samtools and producing files in a storage-efficient BAM (binary version of SAM) format. The resulting BAM files are coordinate-sorted and indexed using Samtools. The syntax for aligning trimmed paired-end reads is as follows: bowtie2 {Alignment.Parameters} -× ${Genome_Index} \\ -1 ${Trim.R1} -2 ${Trim.R2} | samtools view -bS - > ${Sample}.bam samtools sort ${Sample}.bam -o {Sample}.coordsorted.bam samtools index ${sample}.coordsorted.bam Please note that alignment to the primary genome (mm10) and Spike-in sequence (Ampr) is done separately. Alignment parameters and genome indices for each is listed below.\nMus musculus Alignment Parameters [https://www.protocols.io/view/cut-amp-tag-data-processing-and-analysis-tutorial-bjk2kkye.html[href=https://www.protocols.io/view/cut-amp-tag-data-processing-and-analysis-tutorial-bjk2kkye.html]]: --local --very-sensitive-local --no-unal --no-mixed --no-discordant – phred33 -I 10 -X 700 Genome Index: Pre-built bowtie2 indices for Mus musculus (UCSC mm10) can be retrieved directly from iGenomes (Illumina, Inc.).\nSpike-in Alignment Parameters [https://www.protocols.io/view/cut-amp-tag-data-processing-and-analysis-tutorial-bjk2kkye.html[href=https://www.protocols.io/view/cut-amp-tag-data-processing-and-analysis-tutorial-bjk2kkye.html]] --end-to-end --very-sensitive --no-overlap --no-dovetail --no- mixed --no-discordant --phred33 -I 10 -X 700 Genome Index: FASTA sequence of the Ampicillin resistance gene from pBlueScript II SK (+) (Addgene plasmid # 212205, GenBank ID: X52328.1) was used to build an index using bowtie2-build.",
    "Alignment statistics. With Bowtie2, the alignment summary is printed to the standard error where it can be collected and processed. The essential metrics from Bowtie2 include: 1) Total number of paired reads examined; 2) Total number of mapped reads (Uniquely aligned reads + multi mapping reads). This can be used to derive the alignment rate. Ideally, an alignment rate between 50 and 100% is expected, however, we did observe lower rates. The reads that are not mapping either to the primary genome or to the spike-in are most probably due to amplified primers (Figure 14[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig14]). For such samples, we have still observed good genomic coverage.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/950-Fig14.jpg\nFigure 14. Source of unmappable reads\nA bioanalyzer image shows small fragments of less than 100 bp that are likely to give rise to unmappable reads during their alignment to genome.\nMultiQC provides a convenient way of aggregating the statistics for all samples. MultiQC is run in a directory containing the appropriate log files where it will automatically detect and collect them to produce a summary report.\nPost-alignment filtering.\nFirst, the resulting BAM files are filtered to only retain mapped and properly paired reads using the Samtools flag -f2.\nSecond, only uniquely aligned reads are kept by performing MAPQ-based filtering with the Samtools flag -q 10.\nLastly, duplicates are marked and removed using MarkDuplicates from Picard.\nSpike-in normalization.",
    "Per-sample normalization factors. Normalization factors for a set of libraries associated with a particular histone or transcription factor is calculated using reads mapped to the Spike-in sequence. Normalization factors for each sample is calculated as: Normalization Factor = Spikemin/Spikesample where: Spikemin = No. of reads corresponding to the sample with minimum number of mapped reads within the set, Spikesample = No. of total mapped reads corresponding to the sample for which the normalization factor is being calculated.\nBigWigs and Bedgraphs\nThe normalization factors are used with bamCoverage from deepTools (Ramirez et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]) to obtain spike-in normalized bigwig and bedgraph files.

The filtered peak files are converted into bigBed using bedToBigBed to enable visualization on the UCSC genome browser.\nDownstream analysis\nTiming: 1–3 days\nFunctional Analysis and annotation of Peaks\nPeak annotation and visualization:",
    "Annotation: Genomic features associated with peaks are obtained using ChIPseeker, an R package. Informative annotations include, but not limited to, genes and cis-regulatory elements near identified peaks.\nVisualization: Tools such as deeptools can be used to visualize the enrichment profile of peaks around transcription start sites (TSSs).\nFunctional analysis of peaks: To study the biological relevance of enriched regions associated with a histone or transcription factor, various downstream analyses can be done using annotations from 78a. Though a detailed overview is beyond the scope of this protocol, here are some examples:\nIt is useful to find biological themes (e.g., pathways, molecular function etc.) associated with enriched regions. Databases such as GO (http://geneontology.org/[href=http://geneontology.org/]), REACTOME (https://reactome.org/[href=https://reactome.org/]) and KEGG (https://www.genome.jp/kegg/[href=https://www.genome.jp/kegg/]) can be queried to find overrepresented \"terms\" (set of genes associated with a function or pathway) within the annotated gene lists;\nMotif enrichment analysis;\nVarious differential analyses to compare CUT&Tag libraries (e.g., WT vs KO)."
