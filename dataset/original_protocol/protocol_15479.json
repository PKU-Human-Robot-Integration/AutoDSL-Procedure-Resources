    "Part 1. Surgical preparation\nIn case programmed electrical stimulation experiments are performed as survival surgeries in mice sterile conditions will be necessary. However, the most common type of experiment is terminal in nature, for which regular clear surgical techniques suffice.\nThe mouse is anesthetized using 2% isoflurane in 0.5 L/min 100% O2. \nHair clippers are used to shave the fur from the neckline to mid chest level.\nThe anesthetized mouse is placed in a supine position, with its limbs taped onto ECG electrodes incorporated in a heating board (Indus Instruments, Houston, TX). And the surgical area is disinfected with 10% Povidone Iodine. A recommended system includes a rectal temperature probe connected to a heating pad controlled by a thermoanalyzer system, such that the body temperature is maintained at 37.0 °C ± 1.0 °C.\nPart 2. Cannulation and insertion of EP catheter into right atrium and ventricle\nAfter confirming by a toe-pinch that the mouse is fully anesthetized, an 1/2 inch incision is made to the right of the midline with the caudal terminus at the level of the clavicle. \nSubcutaneous tissue, salivary glands, and lymphatic tissues are separated by means of blunt dissection to visualize the right jugular vein. \nThe proximal end of the vein is tied with a 6-0 suture. Pulling gently on this suture will keep the internal jugular vein straight while inserting the catheter. Another suture is placed under the vein at the distal end of the visualized segment. This suture will be tied around the catheter once the catheter is placed optimally within the heart, to ensure hemostasis and maintain the catheter in the desired position (Figure 1).",
    "The computer-based data acquisition is now started to record surface ECG and 4 leads of intracardiac electrograms simultaneously (i.e., IOX-2 acquisition software, Emka Technologies, VA, USA). For intracardiac electrogram recording, electrodes on the catheter are connected to an external stimulator in \"recording\" mode (i.e., model STG3008, MultiChannel Systems, Reutlingen, Germany). \nUsing micro-scissors, a small incision is made in the longitudinal direction of the vein, and the 1.1F octapolar catheter (EPR-800, Millar Instruments, Houston, TX) is advanced through the vein into the right atrium. Gently pulling on the proximal suture will help keep the internal jugular vein straight and will allow easier passage of the catheter into the right atrium and ventricle. Proper catheter position is verified by visualization of the waveforms of the 4 intracardiac electrograms at the level of the apex of the right ventricle, the base of the right ventricle, the atrioventricular node, and the right atrium, respectively (Figure 2). \nThe distal suture is now tied off to secure the catheter position and prevent possible bleeding.\nPart 3. Programmed Electrical Stimulation\nIn the case of selective atrial pacing, the electrode pair located inside the atrium is switched from \"recoding\" mode to \"stimulation\" mode, while the other electrode pairs remain in \"recording\" mode. \nTo determine whether a mouse has an increased vulnerability to atrial arrhythmias, programmed electrical stimulation of the right atrium is performed. First, the atrial pacing threshold is determined by applying 2-ms current pulses (at least 50) at different basic cycle lengths (BCL) to test for consistency of stimulus capture. The BCL of the initial pulse train is slightly lower than the intrinsic BCL, and is decreased by 10 ms (for example, 100 ms, 90 ms, 80 ms, and 70 ms). The typical current amplitude required for stimulus capture is 100-200 μA.",
    "The sinus node recovery time (SNRT) is measured after applying a 15-s atrial pacing train at a BCL of 100 ms. SNRT is defined as the interval between the last stimulus in the pacing train and the onset of first spontaneous sinus beat. \nThe atrial effective refractory period (AERP) is determined by applying series of atrial pacing trains at a fixed BCLs (i.e., 100 ms) with a coupled shorter S2 premature stimulus. The S1-S2 interval is progressively reduced by 2-ms in each pacing train from 70ms to 20ms. The AERP is defined as the longest S1-S2 coupling interval for atria that failed to generate a propagated beat with S2 (S1 being the regular train pulse, and S2 the premature stimulus). Between each stimulation protocol, there was a recovery period of at least 30 seconds.\nThe effective refractory period of the atrioventricular (AV) node (AVNERP) is determined by applying series of atrial pacing trains at BCL of 100 ms with a coupled S2 premature stimulus. The S1-S2 interval is progressively reduced by 2 ms each pacing train from 70 ms to 20 ms. The AVNERP is defined as the longest S1-S2 coupling interval at which the premature stimulation delivered to the atrium is followed by a His potential but not by a QRS complex. Between each stimulation protocol, there was a recovery period of at least 30 seconds.",
    "Inducibility of atrial arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation (AF), may be tested using the burst pacing protocol described by Verheule et al.2 A series of 2 second bursts is applied to determine inducibility of atrial arrhythmias. The first 2 second burst has a cycle length (CL) of 40 ms, and each successive 2 second burst has a CL of 2-ms shorter than the previous burst, until the final CL of 20 ms. In the absence of an arrhythmogenic substrate, the heart will resume sinus rhythm immediately following the pacing protocol. In the case of atrial flutter, there will be a regular pattern of fast A waves seen on the atrial electrogram, whereas the frequency of the ventricular response is typically slower, as seen on the ventricular electrogram. In case of atrial fibrillation, the surface ECG will show irregular RR intervals in the absence of P waves. Additionally, the atrial electrogram will reveal rapid and irregular A waves, whereas the ventricular electrogram will reveal irregular and slower ventricular waves (Figure 3). Arrhythmia induction protocols are typically performed in triplicate, and an arrhythmia is considered present if it can be evoked in at least 2 out of 3 trials.3,4.\nPart 4. Removal of Catheter\nAfter all pacing protocols are finished, data acquisition is stopped. The suture at the distal end of the catheter is gently cut off, in order to release the catheter. \nIn case of terminal EP studies, the knot is gently loosened to release the catheter.\nAt the conclusion of the study, the mouse will be humanely euthanized while under isoflurane using cervical dislocation.\nRepresentative Results",
    "Surface ECG and intracardiac electrograms are recorded simultaneously throughout the in vivo electrophysiology study, and are reviewed in detail following the completion of all protocols. The baseline electrophysiological parameters include PR interval, PQ interval, QRS duration, QT intervals, and QRS morphology. These parameters can be measured manually, or automatically using the data acquisition software IOX-2 or ECG-AUTO (Emka Technologies, VA, USA). \nThe SNRT, AERP, and AVNERP provide information regarding the sinus node \"pacemaker\" function, atrial, and AV nodal conduction properties, respectively. Examples of pacing-induced episodes of atrial fibrillation can be found in the paper by Chelu et al.4\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/1730/1730fig1.jpgFigure 1.
