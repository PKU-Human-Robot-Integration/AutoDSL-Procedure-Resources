    "Designing the protocolHere, we describe the experimental design used in our lab to study PPI response in mice (Busquets-Garcia et al., 2017), but the protocol can be modified by adjusting the pulse and prepulse intensities, the number of trials, inter-trial intervals etc., appropriate for exploring different experimental questions.Begin the session with a 5-min acclimation period. During the acclimation period, the constant background noise of 70-dB white noise is presented for the animal to adapt to the animal holder, startle box and background noise. The session then proceeds through the presentation of 90 different trials (Figure 2): imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180329/20180329204713_9381.jpgFigure 2. Representative session using the described experimental design. The first five trials consist of five pulse-alone trials (A), the intermediate 80 trials are divided into 10 blocks of randomized pulse-alone trials, prepulse-alone trials, combinations of prepulse-pulse trials and no-stimulus trials (B) and the session is concluded with a final block of five consecutive pulse-alone trials (C). Prepulse intensities (73 dB, 76 dB and 82 dB) are above the 70 dB background.The first five trials consist of five pulse-alone trials where 120 dB of white noise is presented in isolation for a duration of 20 msec (i.e., with no prepulse). These trials serve to habituate and stabilize the animals to the startle response. Subsequently, ten blocks of trials are presented. Each block consists of one pulse-alone trial, three prepulse-alone trials (+3, +6, or +12 units above the background of 70 dB), three combinations of prepulse-pulse trials, and one no-stimulus trial (i.e., background only) (Table 1). The 8 trials are presented in a randomized order within each block, with the inter-trial interval (ITI) varying randomly between 10 and 30 sec, intended to minimize habituation to startle across trials.",
    "Notes:  The advantage of randomized ITIs is in the fact that the animal cannot predict the time when the next stimulus presentation will occur. For example, attention to the prepulse can increase the animal’s efficacy in suppressing startle responses. ITIs below 10 sec should be avoided in order to exclude effects caused by muscle fatigue and refractory periods of muscle responses.The intensities of the prepulse should be kept at levels above the background noise but also low enough that they do not elicit a significant startle response on their own, the margin being approximately 2-20 dB above background levels (e.g., +3, +6 or +12 dB above a background of 70 dB). It is important to note that sensitivity to the prepulse may also vary between strain, gender or age of the animals.Table 1. Representation of the different types of trial used in the behavioral protocolimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180329/20180329204905_9448.jpgThe session is concluded with a final block of five consecutive pulse-alone trials, as in the first block.Note: Stimulus rise-time, duration, and intensity are variables that affect startle reflex magnitude (Graham, 1975; Hoffman and Searle, 1968). All the parameters should be carefully decided after taking into account the strain, age, sex and genetic background of the animals, since different lines can exhibit different responses to the startle stimuli (Willott et al., 1995 and 2003). Running the experimentCalibrate the loudspeakers and the sensitivity of the transducer platform of the startle chambers (Figure 3). Follow manufacturer’s guidelines for effective sound and movement calibration. Note: Calibration of the sound and the movement sensors is very important for obtaining valid test results. Consequently, these must be routinely calibrated before each experiment. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180329/20180329205216_4551.jpgFigure 3.",
    "Representative images of loudspeakers (A) and movement sensitivity detector (B) used for the calibration of the startle chambersHaving created your experimental protocol (A1, A2), you can create a study database using the SR-LAB startle apparatus software, defining both the experimental sessions and the subjects that will be tested. Transport the mice to the testing room. You can simultaneously test as many mice as the number of chambers you have available (software compatible with up to a maximum of 16 chambers). For housing conditions, see Note 1. Take care not to stress the mice before starting the experiment and, to that end, make no changes to the home cage (e.g., bedding) for at least 24 h before the experiment. Illumination and noise levels in the testing room should be comparable to those in the housing rooms in order to minimize environmental effects on the behavioral outcome. Tubular animal enclosure minimizes stress from being restrained while animal remains centered over the sensor for consistently reliable results.In each experimental session, place the mouse in the cylinder inside the testing chamber and secure the door shut. Run the experimental session according to the experimental design described above. The session will stop automatically at the end of the protocol (after approximately 35-40 min). Remove each mouse from the chamber at the end of the experimental session and return it to its home cage. Wipe clean the animal holders and chambers with water and allow to dry before introducing the next animal.Select the next session on the screen and repeat the procedure for all the animals.At the end of all the sessions, clean the cylinders and chambers with 70% ethanol and leave them to dry. Save the data obtained for a subsequent detailed analysis of acoustic startle and acoustic prepulse inhibition responses."
