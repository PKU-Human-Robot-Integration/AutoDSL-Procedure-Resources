    "1. Preparation of cells and culture dishes\nNOTE: Perform Steps 1-3 in a tissue culture laminar flow hood. Wear gloves.\nIf using glass bottom dishes, coat the glass with fibronectin. Skip to Step 1.2 if using plastic dishes.\n\t\nMake a 0.1 mg/mL solution of fibronectin: dilute 1 mL of 1 mg/mL fibronectin solution in 9 mL of 1 X PBS.\nCover the glass bottom of each well with 0.5-1 mL of fibronectin and incubate for 1-5 min at room temperature.\nUsing a pipette, collect the fibronectin solution and store at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The fibronectin solution can be reused multiple times.\nWash the glass once with 1-2 mL 1 X PBS, and aspirate off PBS.\nPlate 1 x 105 cells per well of a 6-well plate in 2 mL of the appropriate cell culture media (see Table 1 for cell numbers to use for different sized wells). If using a cell line that stably expresses the caspase BiFC components (see Discussion), plate 2 x 105 cells and proceed to the treatment step (Step 3).\nAllow cells to adhere to the dish overnight at 37 °C in a tissue culture incubator.\n2. Transfection of cells to introduce the caspase BiFC components\nTransfect cells with the appropriate transfection reagent.\n\tNOTE: This protocol outlines the instructions for Lipofectamine 2000, which has been optimized for minimal toxicity. This protocol has been successfully used in Hela cells, MCF7 cells and LN18 cells. If using additional transfection reagents follow the manufacturer's instructions and optimize as needed.\n\t\nAdd 12 µL of the transfection reagent to 750 µL of reduced serum media in a sterile tube.\nIncubate at room temperature for 5 min.",
    "Add 10 ng of a reporter plasmid (a plasmid encoding a fluorescent protein, e.g. red fluorescent protein [RFP], that will label the transfected cells) to a sterile 1.5 mL tube for each well to be transfected.\nAdd 20 ng of each caspase BiFC plasmid (e.g., 20 ng of caspase-2 prodomain [C2 Pro]-VC and 20 ng of C2 Pro-VN) to each tube (Table 2).\nBring each tube up to a total volume of 100 µL by adding reduced serum media.\nUsing a p200 pipette, add 100 µL of transfection reagent solution from Step 2.1.2 to the plasmid mixture in a dropwise manner.\nIncubate the plasmid-transfection reagent mix for 20 min at room temperature.\nAspirate the media from the cells using a pipette or with suction and then, using a p1000 pipette, pipette 800 µL of serum free media gently down the side of the well.\nUsing a p200 pipette, add 200 µL of the DNA-lipid complex dropwise to each well.\nIncubate the cells in a tissue culture incubator at 37 °C for 3 h.\nTaking care not to disrupt the monolayer, remove the serum free media containing the DNA-lipid complexes by aspiration using suction or with a pipette.\nPipette 2 mL of pre-warmed (37 °C) complete growth media gently down the side of each well.\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C in a tissue culture incubator for 24-48 h for optimal protein expression.\n3. Induction of caspase activation\nTreat with a drug or stimulus that induces caspase activation approximately 24 h post-transfection.\n\t\nAdd the desired concentration of the drug to pre-warmed (37 °C) imaging media (complete growth media supplemented with Hepes [20 mM, pH 7.2-7.5] and 2-mercaptoethanol [55 µM]) and mix gently (Table 3).",
    "Aspirate the media from the cells using a pipette or with suction and then, using a pipette, pipette 2 mL of the solution from 3.1.1 gently down the side of the well.\nAdd imaging media without the drug to one well as an untreated control.\nIncubate the cells in a tissue culture incubator at 37 °C or proceed to Step 4.3 for a time-lapse experiment.\n4.  Caspase BiFC data acquisition\nCaspase BiFC for single time point acquisition\nTurn on the microscope and fluorescent light source following the manufacturer's instructions.\nFind the cells under the RFP filter and focus on the reporter gene fluorescence.\nUsing a hand-tally counter, count all of the RFP-positive cells in the visual field. Record the number.\nWhile maintaining the same visual field, switch to the GFP filter (or YFP filter if available) and, using a hand-tally counter, count the number of red cells that are also green (Venus-positive). Switch back and forth between the two filters to ensure that only the red cells are evaluated for Venus-positivity. Record the number (Figure 3).\nCount at least 100 RFP-positive cells from each of three individual areas of the plate.\nIn each area, calculate the percentage of Venus-positive transfected cells (i.e. red cells that are also green). Average the resulting percentages to get the standard deviation.\nThree-dimensional imaging of caspase BiFC\nTurn on the microscope following the manufacturer's instructions and launch the acquisition software.\nSelect the 60x or 63x oil objective and place a drop of oil on the objective\nPlace the culture dish on the microscope stage using the correct plate holder.\nUsing either an epifluorescence light source and the microscope eye piece or the confocal lasers and the computer screen, navigate to a field of interest.\nFocus on the reporter fluorescence using the RFP laser or filter.",
    "If epifluorescence has been used up to this point, switch the light source to the confocal lasers and visualize the live image of the cells as acquired by the camera and displayed by the acquisition software on the computer screen.\nUsing the joystick control and the focus wheel, fine tune the focus and position of the cells so that the cells are in the center of the view finder. Choose cells that are separated from each other and are not overlapping.\nInput the percentage laser power to 50% and the exposure time at 100 ms for both Venus and RFP as a starting point to determine the optimal settings to use for the experiment.\nTurn on the live capture and inspect the resulting image and the accompanying display histograms for both channels.\nIf the signal is low and the image is hard to make out, increase the percentage laser power and/or exposure time in increments until the signal in the image looks good.\nEnsure that the signal does not reach saturation. Inspect the display histogram to make sure a distinct peak is visible for each fluor. If the peak encompasses the entire histogram display, input lower laser power and exposure settings (Figure 2).\nVisualize control (untreated or non-transfected) cells under the same conditions to ensure that the signal is specific.\n\t\tNOTE: Single color transfectants can also be used to control for crossover, but if the signals are spatially distinct (e.g. mitochondrial versus cytosolic) this is not necessary.\nSelect or open the Z stack module in the microscope software.\nUsing the focus knob, approximate the focal position corresponding to the center of the cell.\nAdjust the focus in one direction until the cell is no longer visible, select this as the top position.",
    "Adjust the focus in the opposite direction until the cell is again no longer visible and select this as the bottom position.\nChoose the optimal step size (usually approximately 20 µm) and start the acquisition to instruct the camera to automatically take a single image in each channel at each of the 20 µm steps between the top and bottom positions.\nUse 3D rendering software to reconstruct the 3D image (Figure 4, Movie 1).\nTime-lapse imaging of caspase BiFC\nAt least 1 h prior to the experiment, turn on the microscope and set the temperature to 37 °C.\nSelect the 40x, 60x, or 63x oil objective and place a drop of oil on the objective.\nPlace the culture dish on the microscope stage using the correct plate holder.\nIf a CO2 source is available, place the CO2 delivery device (usually a plexiglass lid attached to the tube that delivers the CO2) on top of the plate holder. Set the CO2 level to 5% and turn on the CO2 controller from within the software. If a CO2 source is not available, include 20 mM Hepes to buffer the media.\nNavigate to a field of transfected cells and visualize the live image of the cells as acquired by the camera and displayed by the acquisition software on the computer screen using the RFP laser.\nFollowing Steps 4.2.8-4.2.12, input the settings for percentage laser power and exposure time for the RFP laser. Keep these values as low as possible while still being able to detect the fluorescent signal.\nUsing a positive control sample (see Table 3 for examples), follow Steps 4.2.8-4.2.12 to input the settings for percentage laser power and exposure time for the YFP laser light. Keep these values as low as possible while still being able to detect Venus signal.",
    "For each well of the plate, choose a number of different positions that contain one or more cells expressing the reporter.\nInput the time interval between each frame of the time-lapse and total number of frames to be taken. Ensure there is time to acquire all the selected positions before the next frame is to be taken.\nRe-visit each position and correct and update the focus as needed.\nTo correct for focal drift that can result from changes in temperature or external vibrations, turn on the focus drift correction system (if available).\nBegin the time-lapse and save the data.\nAnalyze the data using available imaging software (Figure 5, Movie 2).\nSubscription Required.
