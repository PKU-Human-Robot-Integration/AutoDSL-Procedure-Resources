    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nNote: Positive and negative controls of FFPE cell samples should be included from step 1 side by side with human archived FFPE tissue samples.\nPretreatment of FFPE tissue slides (days 1 and 2)\nTiming: 5–7 h (day 2)\nThis section describes three major steps—slide baking, deparaffinization, and antigen retrieval—for the appropriate preparation of FFPE tissue slides prior to sample deglycosylation and IHC staining procedures.\nSlide baking\nPlace the slides on a staining rack in a 40°C oven overnight (12–18 h).\nBake the slides in a dry oven at 58°C–65°C for 2–3 h the next day (day 2).\nCool the slides to room temperature (20°C–25°C) before proceeding to the next step.\nNote: To minimize tissue impairment or loss during the IHC staining process with additional sample deglycosylation steps, we highly recommend placing slides for a longer incubation time at 40°C prior to baking at 58°C–65°C to help with tissue adhesion. For tissues that do not lie perfectly flat on slides, we have performed 40°C incubation for 3 days and reached experimental completion. See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nDeparaffinization and rehydration\nDeparaffinize or dewax slides in xylene solution for 10 min in each container, 6 times (5 min in each container if slide numbers are less than five).\nRehydrate the slides by sequentially dipping them into a series of ethanol baths:\n100% ethanol, 10 dips per container, 3 times\n95% ethanol, 10 dips per container, 3 times\n80% ethanol, 10 dips per container, 2 times\nWash the slides by rinsing them 3 times with distilled H2O.\nAlternatives: Xylene can be substituted with Histo-clear solution (National Diagnostics; Cat#HS200), which is less toxic, less flammable, and biodegradable and thus friendlier to the environment than xylene, although it is more expensive.",
    "Pause point: The slides can be kept in distilled H2O at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for up to 2 h and then antigen retrieval can be continued on the same day.\nHeat-induced antigen retrieval\nImmerse the slides in citrate buffer (10 mM, pH 6.0).\nHeat the slides in a microwave oven.\n1,000 W for 2 min\n200 W for 8 min\nCool down slides for 1−2 h to room temperature (20°C–25°C) before proceeding to the next step.\nWash the slides with PBS for 5 min, 2 times.\nNote: Antigen retrieval used prior to IHC staining on FFPE tissue sections is an effective method of unmasking the epitopes for antibody binding. It can be performed by heat (e.g., microwave, autoclave, pressure cooker, and water bath) or enzyme treatment (e.g., pronase, trypsin, and pepsin). Here, we recommend using a heat method to denature tissue sections at 95°C–100°C, for instance, microwave heating in the present protocol.\nPause point: The slides can be kept in PBS at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for up to 2 h and then continued with sample deglycosylation with PNGase F enzymatic digestion on the same day.\nSample deglycosylation (day 2 continued and day 3)\nTiming: 4 h (day 2)\nThe principle of heat-induced antigen retrieval to expose epitopes is in line with the glycoprotein denaturing reaction step, as described in the manufacturer’s deglycosylation protocol: https://www.neb.com/protocols/2014/07/31/pngase-f-protocol[href=https://www.neb.com/protocols/2014/07/31/pngase-f-protocol]. Taking advantage of the consistency between these two steps, which can both cause protein denaturing to facilitate enzymatic digestion, we developed a new protocol by incorporating sample deglycosylation into a conventional IHC assay after antigen retrieval. This section describes how to perform the sample deglycosylation protocol in an IHC assay in two major steps, glycoprotein denaturing reaction and PNGase F treatment.\nGlycoprotein denaturing reaction\nDiscard the PBS.",
    "Fill the staining jar with enough glycoprotein denaturing buffer to cover the slides.\nIncubate the slides at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 3 h.\nNote: Since we have performed pretreatment of heat-induced antigen retrieval on FFPE tissue sections, an additional heating reaction is not recommended in the glycoprotein denaturing reaction in this protocol to minimize possible tissue damage. We immerse slides in glycoprotein denaturing buffer at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for up to 3 h to complement the effectiveness of pretreating heat-induced antigen retrieval. Although we have not directly compared the heating reaction of FFPE tissue slides in the denaturing reaction condition to that used here, our approach should also be applicable to the heating reaction at 100°C for 10 min in the denaturing reaction condition, according to the manufacturer’s protocol and to the results of recent reports that successfully applied the thermal denaturation strategy (Mei et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Xu et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nNote: To minimize evaporation during the process, we use parafilm to seal the container; this could be substituted with a staining jar with a lid.\nDiscard the glycoprotein denaturing buffer.\nWash the slides with PBS for 5 min, 4 times.\nImmerse the slides with PBS and proceed with the PNGase F treatment procedure immediately.",
    "Critical: SDS as an anionic denaturing detergent in the glycoprotein denaturing buffer that is known to inhibit PNGase F enzymatic activity. To prevent PNGase F inactivation in the next major step, it is important to wash away residual SDS on tissue sections thoroughly after the denaturing reaction. As the SDS concentration will be much diluted after four repeats of slide washing with PBS, we have not tested it by adding a non-ionic detergent, such as a final concentration of 1% of Nonidet P-40 (NP-40), in washing buffer; this may also help to counteract the inhibitory effect of SDS on PNGase F activity. See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nPNGase F treatment\nRemove a maximum of 4–6 slides per 2–3 patients from the container at one time.\nDrain and shake off the excess PBS.\nCarefully wipe around the specimen on each slide.\nCreate a hydrophobic barrier around the slide specimen with a PAP pen.\nNote: The PAP pen is a special marking pen that draws a thin film-like water repellent circle around a specimen on a slide. This hydrophobic barrier keeps staining liquid pooled on the tissue sections for using less reagents per section. The marking circle can be optionally removed by xylene or xylene substitutes after the staining procedure.\nAlternatives: In addition to the PAP pen used in this protocol (Electron Microscopy Sciences; Cat#71310), similar pens are available from other manufacturers, such as Abcam (Cat#ab2601) or Thermo Fisher Scientific (Cat#008899).\nAdd enough of the appropriate solution to cover specimens processed with or without deglycosylation.\nWith deglycosylation: add 5% PNGase F solution to the specimen on the slide labeled with “+”.\nWithout deglycosylation: add PBS solvent alone to the specimen on the slide labeled with “−”.",
    "Critical: Considering that the storage buffer of PNGase F contains 50% glycerol and that an over 5% glycerol concentration may interfere with PNGase F activity, PNGase F is limited to 1/10 (or less) of the total reaction volume, as recommended by the manufacturer, to keep the final glycerol concentration equal to (or less than) 5%. In this protocol, we use PNGase F at 1/20 of the total reaction volume to make a 5% PNGase F working solution in a 2.5% glycerol final concentration, that is, 5 μL of PNGase F per 100 μL of PBS. See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: We recommend making fresh PNGase F solution each time. Depending on the number of tissue sections carried out, the PNGase F solution should be scaled up linearly to accommodate larger reaction volumes.\nCritical: Full coverage of solutions on tissue sections is important. We recommend applying the average volume of 200 μL per section on a slide. However, for large sections (e.g., surgical specimens), more than 200 μL should be used; for small sections (e.g., needle biopsy specimens), less than 200 μL may be enough.\nLay slides flat with the specimen facing upward in a humid chamber.\nPlace the humid chamber in a 37°C incubator in air supplemented with 5% CO2 for 12–18 h.\nNote: Treatment of PNGase F overnight for 12–18 h ensures the complete removal of glycan moieties from the surface antigens, although we can also test the incubation time for less than 12 h to facilitate the process. This deglycosylation protocol is optimized for PD-L1 pathological assessment; however, PNGase F treatment conditions, including enzyme concentration and incubation time, may vary depending on the protein of interest. Further optimization is highly recommended.",
    "Remove the humid chamber with slides from the incubator and place it on a bench the next day (day 3).\nDrain and shake off excess solution from the slides.\nPlace the slides in a clean staining jar filled with PBS.\nWash the slides with PBS for 5 min, 2 times.\nImmerse the slides with PBS.\nPause point: The slides can be kept in PBS at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for up to 2 h and then continued with an IHC staining procedure the same day.\nIHC staining: Blocking and primary antibody incubation (days 3 and 4)\nTiming: 1 h (day 3)\nAfter sample deglycosylation has completed, the tissue sections can be processed for the subsequent steps using a routinely used, conventional IHC method, unless otherwise noted. Tissue sections should not be allowed to dry out during the incubation process. Given that 200 μL results in an average coverage of the entire tissue section on a slide, the required working volume of each solution should be calculated and prepared before the step.\nPeroxidase and non-specific antigen blocking\nBlock endogenous peroxidase\nIncubate the slides with 3% hydrogen peroxide solution (H2O2) for 10 min in a humid chamber at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nWash the slides with PBS for 5 min, 3 times.\nBlock non-specific antigens\nIncubate the slides with 10% blocking buffer (normal goat serum in PBS) for 30 min in a humid chamber at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nWipe off excess blocking buffer from the slides.\nIncubation with primary antibody\nPrepare a 1:100 dilution of anti-PD-L1 rabbit monoclonal antibody in PBS.\nApply the diluted primary antibody to the tissue sections on the slides.\nIncubate the slides in a humid chamber at 4°C overnight (12–18 h).\nWash the slides with PBS for 5 min, 3 times (day 4).",
    "Note: The optimal dilution ratio and incubation time may vary between antibodies. The first time a new primary antibody is tested, we recommend 4°C overnight (12–18 h) incubation to allow more time for the antibody to bind to the antigen at a lower titer. Here, we use a 1:100 antibody-to-PBS ratio, that is, 10 μg/mL of anti-PD-L1 antibody (clone 28-8; Abcam, Cat#ab205921); the concentration could be further adjusted to 2 μg/mL in a 1:500 dilution ratio (Mei et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nNote: There are four PD-L1 antibodies in IHC assays that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for in vitro diagnostic use, including clones 28-8, SP142, 22C3, and SP263 (Buttner et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Adam et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). Besides clone 28-8 used here, this protocol has been successfully applied to clone SP142 (Mei et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). We expect these assays to be an effective general approach for other membrane proteins that are frequently glycosylated at different levels.\nIHC staining: Secondary antibody incubation and detection (day 4 continued)\nTiming: 3–4 h\nIncubation with biotin-conjugated secondary antibody\nPrepare a 1:200 dilution of anti-rabbit secondary antibody in PBS.\nApply the diluted secondary antibody to the tissue sections on the slides.\nIncubate the slides in a humid chamber for 1 h at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nWash the slides with PBS for 5 min, 3 times.\nIncubation with peroxidase-conjugated avidin-biotin complex (ABC-HRP conjugate)\nPrepare a 1:100 dilution of ABC-HRP conjugate in PBS.\nApply the diluted ABC-HRP conjugate to the tissue sections on the slides.\nIncubate the slides in a humid chamber for 1 h at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nWash the slides with PBS for 5 min, 3 times.\nIncubation with AEC chromogen substrate\nPrepare fresh AEC chromogen substrate working solution (0.125%).",
    "Incubate the slides in a staining dish filled with the working solution for 5–10 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nRinse the slides with distilled H2O, 3 times.\nNote: The enzyme HRP catalyzes appropriate chromogenic substrates, such as AEC and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB), into visible colored products to facilitate IHC detection. Here, we use AEC, an aqueous chromogen that is relatively less toxic than is DAB, but DAB can be used as well (Mei et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Xu et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nCounterstaining\nIncubate the slides in Mayer’s hematoxylin for 20–30 s.\nRinse the slides with distilled H2O, 3 times.\nMounting\nApply aqueous mounting medium to the tissue sections on the slides.\nPlace the coverslip on top.\nLay the slides on a flat surface to dry prior to viewing them under a microscope.\nNote: The immunostained images can be viewed under a glass slide microscope (Lee et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) or digitally by digital slide scanners, such as Aperio Digital Pathology Slide Scanners (Leica Biosystems) (Mei et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Xu et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nCritical: Unlike DAB, AEC is soluble in ethanol and xylene. Specimens that have been stained in AEC cannot be dehydrated with ethanol and cleared with xylene before mounting; a suitable aqueous, but not organic, mounting medium should be used for permanent record-keeping.\nPause point: After drying, IHC slides can be stored at room temperature (20°C–25°C)."
