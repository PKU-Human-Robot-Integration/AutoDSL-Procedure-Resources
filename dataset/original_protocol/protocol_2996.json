Border\n              wells can be replaced with cell-free media, or the respective\n              spheroids discarded.\n            \n            Centrifuge the plate (5 min, 300 × g) to facilitate\n            aggregation and pooling of the cells in the center of the well.\n          \n            Incubate plate under culturing conditions for 3–6 days.",
    "Note: Adjust incubation time and\n              seeding densities according to cell type. The spheroids should be\n              300–500 μm in diameter for best staining and imaging results.\n            \nOptional: Include treatments\n              with growth factors and drugs here.\n            \n        MCTS harvest and transfer to Ibidi chamber slide.\n        \nNote: There might be some loss of\n          spheroids during the transfer. We find 70–100% of spheroids can be\n          successfully transferred. Pre-coating the tips with 1% BSA in PBS may\n          help ensure maximal transfer efficiency.\n        \n            After the incubation period, harvest the spheroids by gently\n            pipetting the media up and down in each well and collect the desired\n            number of spheroids (up to 10) in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube (Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\n            \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2745-Fig2.jpg\n                  Figure 2.

By\n                  increasing the diameter of the opening (middle) when compared\n                  to the standard tip (right) sheer forces are reduced and\n                  spheroid integrity is maintained.\n                \nCritical: The spheroids are\n              visible with the naked eye at that point. Cutting off the end of a\n              1000 μL pipette tip prevents sheering of the spheroids (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). The transfer needs to be conducted very carefully to maintain\n              spheroid integrity.\n            \n            Centrifuge the spheroids (A short pulse of 10 s at low\n            g (e.g., 20 × g) suffices!) and aspirate the\n            supernatant carefully.\n            \nNote: Excessive centrifugation\n              during this step will lead to deformation of the spheroids (Figure S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2745-Mmc1.pdf]).\n            \nCritical: Do not disturb\n              spheroids at the bottom of the Eppendorf tube. Leave 50–150 μL of\n              residual media to ensure no spheroids are accidentally discarded.\n              Residual media can be used to transfer the spheroids into the\n              Ibidi chamber slide in the next slide.",
    "Transfer the contents of one Eppendorf tube including the spheroids\n            into a well of the 8-well chamber slide (Ibidi, Germany).\n            \nNote: The well bottom of the Ibidi\n              chamber slide and all spheroids should be fully covered. Add\n              additional media as needed.\n            \nOptional: The spheroids can be\n              embedded in collagen during this step. Timpson et al.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]\n              published a detailed protocol for the economical extraction and\n              polymerization of collagen extracted from rat tails. Briefly:\n            \nAlternatives: Commercial\n              collagen solutions are available for purchase.\n            \n                Add equal volumes of 2× neutralized Collagen I (for 1 mg/mL\n                collagen: 9.7% v/v 10× minimal essential media, 80.6% v/v\n                2 mg/mL collagen I in 17.4 mM acetic acid, 9.7% v/v 0.22M NaOH\n                (pH 7.4)) to the residual media and proceed to transfer the\n                spheroids.\n                \nCritical: The 2× Collagen\n                  solutions needs to be prepared and stored on ice to prevent\n                  pre-mature setting of the collagen. Once the collagen is mixed\n                  with the residual media in the Eppendorf tube, work quickly to\n                  transfer the spheroids into the chamber slide.\n                \nNote: The working volume of\n                  each well is 300 μL; do not exceed 150 μL of total transfer\n                  volume.\n                \n                Instead of step 6.d: Let collagen set for 1h under\n                culturing conditions, add 100 μL of culture media and incubate\n                as desired.\n                \nOptional: Treatments can\n                  be included in this incubation period.\n                \nNote: The working volume in\n                  your well is effectively reduced when working with collagen\n                  embedded samples. Hence, the incubation times, washing times\n                  and reagent concentrations might need adjustment depending on\n                  the concentration and amount of collagen used to embed the\n                  spheroids. If required, adjusted methods for collagen embedded\n                  spheroids are included as separate dot points in the following\n                  section.\n                \n            Allow the spheroids to attach for 8–16 h and proceed to fixation and\n            staining steps.\n            \nNote: The time that is required",
    "for adhesion to the chamber slide is dependent on the cell type\n              used. The time range for cell adhesion should range between 8–16\n              h, although this is cell line dependent. The absence of movement\n              of the spheroids when rocking the slide slightly is a good\n              indicator for sufficient adhesion for further processing.\n              Incubating the spheroids for too long will lead to excessive\n              flattening and the cells spreading out along the well bottom (Figure S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2745-Mmc1.pdf]).\n            \nAlternatives: Suspending\n              the spheroids in collagen (as described above) or sterile agarose\n              (0.8% agar in ddH20) and fixation immediately after the collagen/\n              agarose sets prevents the above-mentioned flattening of the\n              spheroid.\n            \nAlternatives: Commercial\n              solutions for the generation and imaging of 3D cell aggregates are\n              available.

After permeabilization with TX-100,\n      the spheroids are stained using antibodies against the desired target.\n      Finally, the spheroids are cleared and refractive index-matched in the\n      last step prior to imaging.\n    \nNote: The incubation times in the\n      following section yield good results in our hand. However, they can be\n      optimized according to the model used. For example, when using smaller\n      spheroids shorter incubation times can suffice.\n    \nNote: When removing media/ buffers from\n      wells of an Ibidi chamber slide, pick one corner (e.g. bottom left) to\n      avoid disturbing the sample.\n    \n        Fixation and permeabilization of the spheroids.\n        \n            Carefully aspirate the culture medium from each well of the chamber\n            slide and wash twice with 250 μL of 1× PBS.\n            \n                Collagen: Wash three-times with 100–150 μL of 1× PBS for 5 min.",

To avoid\n          cross-reactivity use antibodies from different host species (e.g.\n          mouse and rabbit). Secondary antibodies should have distinct\n          fluorophores with minimal emission over-lap (e.g. AF488 and AF647).\n          Compatibility of fluorophores can be checked in advance using the\n          spectra viewer on\n          fpbase.org[href=https://www.fpbase.org/spectra/].11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]\n          When trailing novel combinations of antibody, validation experiments\n          on single cell layers are recommended (to exclude spectral\n          bleedthrough or cross-reactivity of antibodies).\n        \n            Incubate with 250 μL/well of the primary antibody (1:1000) diluted\n            in the antibody dilution buffer for 40 h at 37°C.\n            \n                Collagen: Incubate with 150 μL/well of a 1:500 dilution of the\n                primary antibody for 40 h.\n              \n            Wash three-times with 250 μL/well 0.5% TX-100 per well for 30 min at\n            room temperature (1.5 h total).\n            \n                Collagen: Wash four-times with 100 μL 0.5% TX-100/well for 1 h\n                (4 h total).\n                \nNote: Increasing the length of\n                  the washing steps can improve the signal to noise ratio.\n                  Optimization for the system at hand is advised.\n                \nCritical: Fluorophores and\n                  fluorescently labelled samples are light sensitive.

We start by\n      locating all the spheroids present using a lower magnification objective,\n      switching to a higher magnification immersion objective, and setting up\n      the image acquisition settings. Finally, we set up the z-stack for one\n      region of interest and proceed to image all spheroids present in the\n      sample.\n    \nNote: For help with these steps refer to\n      your local microscopy technician.\n    \nNote: Acclimatize the sample to the\n      temperature of the imaging room for at least 30 min. This is especially\n      important if the sample was stored at 4°C, which will give rise to\n      condensation. Ensure the bottom of the chamber is dry as the water\n      droplets alter the refractive index of the immersion medium and can lead\n      to additional light scattering.\n    \nAlternatives: If available, the\n      usage of a camera attached to the confocal can help with the initial\n      localization of the spheroids (replacing the nuclear channel used in",
    "steps 10.a-f). We recommend high binning, low resolution and short\n      exposure times to accelerate the generation of the plate map.

Imaging strategy for locating spheroids in an uneven\n              chamber slide and when embedded in collagen\n            \n              In our experience, the focus level is often different for each\n              well of a chamber slide (uneven slide, panel A). To ensure all the\n              spheroids are picked up during the initial plate-wide imaging, the\n              average z-height of the middle of the spheroids (green line) can\n              be used a focus level for the imaging (red line). The same applies\n              to collagen-embedded samples (panel B) that naturally are at\n              different heights in the set collagen (grey). The slicing at\n              different heights (e.g., middle or bottom) and variability in\n              spheroid size lead to supposedly different sizes (top view) in the\n              final plate map (panel C).
