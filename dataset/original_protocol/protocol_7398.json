The ratio of plasmids to lipofectamine 2000 is 100 ng:0.2 µL.Treat cells with 100 µM ABA or ABA-DMNB (see note below) with and without exposure to 405 nm light for 2 min.Incubate cells for another 24 h.Harvest cells for RNA extraction, m6A-IP, and RT-PCR as described above.Note: The photo-caged ABA, ABA-DMNB, was synthesized by lab members by caging the ABA with 4,5-Dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzyl (DMNB), which can be removed by 405 nm light. The light was emitted from a fluorescence microscopy (model information provided in the Equipment section). Additionally, the primer information can be found in section G. Investigation of m6A level by m6A-immunoprecipitation.Exemplary results Here are some exemplary results (Figure 7) adapted from the original article “Inducible and reversible RNA N6-methyladenosine editing” (Shi et al., 2022).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4607/bioprotoc-13-03-4607-g007.jpgFigure 7. Exemplary results of main assays. A) Protein expression of the constructs of dCas13b-PYL with HA tag and ABI-M3nls with Flag tag. B) Localization of the expressed dCas13b-PYL and ABI-M3nls. Both proteins were localized in the nucleus. C) Targeted m6A deposition by the inducible m6A writing system on the targeted ACTB mRNA. M3 refers to the m6A writer, METTL3, and M3* refers to the mutant version of METTL3 without the catalytic function. The m6A level can only be elevated by the inducible m6A writing platform (dCas13b-PYL + ABI-M3 + gRNA) in the presence of ABA to a comparable level as the positive control (dCas13b-M3 + gRNA), but no increase can be observed without ABA or by using the catalytic inactive M3*.",
    "Results are normalized to the group of dCas13b-PYL + sgRNA + ABA. D) Impact of installed m6A on the stability of target ACTB mRNA. The installed m6A on the ACTB mRNA by the inducible m6A writing platform destabilized the mRNA just like the reported dCas13b-M3 + sgRNA. Results are normalized to the group of dCas13b-PYL + ABI-M3 + NT-sgRNA + ABA. E) Targeted m6A level removal by the inducible m6A erasing system on the target Malat1 lncRNA by SELECT assay. The smaller Ct value reflects the higher amounts of full-length product of SELECT-PCR, indicating the lower enrichment of m6A on the target. ALK refers to the m6A eraser, ALKBH5, and ALK* refers to the mutant version of ALKBH5 without the catalytic function. The m6A level can only be reduced by the inducible m6A erasing platform (dCas13b-PYL + ABI-ALK + gRNA) in the presence of ABA to a comparable level as the positive control (dCas13b-ALK + gRNA), but no increase can be observed without ABA or by using the catalytic inactive ALK*. Results are normalized to the group of dCas13b-PYL + sgRNA + ABA. F) Recruitment of METTL3 on the target ACTB mRNA after ABA removal. The METTL3 enzyme of inducible m6A writing platform can be recruited to target site by the treatment of ABA, which will be released after the ABA removal by wash. Results are normalized to the group of dCas13b-PYL + sgRNA + ABA."
