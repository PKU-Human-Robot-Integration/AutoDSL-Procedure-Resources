    "According to the directive 2010/63/EU, experiments with non-hatched avian embryos during the first two-thirds of embryonic development do not need permission by an ethics committee.\n1. Storage and Breeding of the Eggs\nObtain fertilized hen eggs (Table of Materials) from a local breeder.\n\tNOTE: Eggs may be stored at 14 °C in a humidified atmosphere for up to 10 days after laying before use for experiments.\nIncubate the eggs at 38 °C with an average humidity of 40 - 60% for 10 or 11 days in an incubator that constantly turns the eggs.\n2. Selection of the Eggs\nCheck the eggs for fertilization after incubation of up to 11 days. Use a candling light for this step. Dip the fringe of the candling lamp into an inkpad and candle the pointed side of the egg.\nTo identify the air bladder, check for differences in brightness on the top of the egg.\n\tNOTE: The air bladder appears as a round, more transparent region, while the albumen is darker when the egg is candled.\nAfter detection of the air bladder, mark the location by pressing the lamp slightly against the egg with the previously applied ink.\nExclude non-fertilized eggs at this step, which do not show a difference in brightness between the albumen and air bladder.\n3. Injection of Substances\nPrepare the substance of interest (e.g., the herbal extract or insulin) by diluting the substance in the desired concentration in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) buffer. For example, 3.3 U/mL of a commercially available insulin analog in HBSS.",
    "For the application of the selected compound, carefully peck the eggshell with a pointed pair of tweezers in the marked area of the air bladder. Do not form a hole larger than the diameter of the needle of the syringe. Inject the buffer solution (300 µL) containing the substance of interest into the pecked area via a syringe.\n\tNOTE: Use sterile, 1-ml single-use syringes, pipette tips, and vessels. Wear gloves and a lab coat for the experiments.\nTo determine the blood glucose-reducing effect of a substance, place the eggs back into the incubator for 60, 120, and 180 min, respectively. To determine basal blood glucose levels, include at least 10 - 15 non-treated control eggs.\n4. Toxicity Tests\nAfter application of the selected compound for 24 h, equilibrate the eggshell membrane with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffer (enough to cover the whole eggshell membrane) for at least 30 s.\nRemove excess PBS buffer by pouring it away.\nPull off the eggshell membrane carefully with a pointed pair of tweezers.\nCheck blood vessels for lesions and confirm vitality (e.g., movement) of the chick embryo.\n\tNOTE: See Figure 1 for comparison of vital versus non-vital embryos after application of a toxic herbal extract.\n5. Measurement of the Blood Glucose Value\nAt the respective time point, carefully remove the eggshell above the air bladder and equilibrate the eggshell membrane with PBS buffer (enough to cover the whole eggshell membrane).\nRemove excess PBS buffer by pouring it away.\nCarefully pull off the eggshell membrane with a pointed pair of tweezers.\nCut and remove the chorioallantoic membrane with a micro-scissor, to enable good access to suitable blood vessels. Cut the membrane at least 2 - 3 cm. Do not cut any large vessels in the membrane itself to avoid unwanted blood loss of the embryo.",
    "Locate the large vessel originating from the abdomen of the embryo. Lift this vessel out of the albumen with a closed micro-scissor and place it on a plastic pH-strip. Move the pH strip under the vessel, which is held with the micro-scissor, and pull back the micro-scissor away carefully.\nRemove 1 - 2 mL of the liquid beneath the chorioallantoic membrane with a pipette to avoid dilution of the blood in the next step. Dry the vessel and pH-strip with filter paper, before the vessel is cut.\nCut the blood vessel carefully with a micro-scissor on one side. Do not cut through the vessel completely.\n\tNOTE: The vessel is approximately 1-mm thick. Do not cut more than half of the vessel to avoid cutting through the vessel entirely, as it may slip off the strip and no blood collection is possible.\nCollect the leaking blood on the pH-strip using a pipette. Ten microliters of blood are required to determine glucose levels using the blood glucose meter.\n6. Statistical Evaluation\nCalculate the mean value of at least 10 individual eggs per time point and normalize these values to one of the control eggs (non- or buffer-treated eggs).\nSubsequently, determine the percentage of decrease. In addition, use insulin as a positive control.\n\tNOTE: Repeat each experiment at least three times."
