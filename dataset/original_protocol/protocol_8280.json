    "1. Assembly of Defined Macromolecular Complexes on Biolayer Interferometry (BLI) Biosensor Surfaces\nAssembly of prepore anthrax toxin complex on a PDEA-modified amine reactive biosensor surface\nHydrate an amine reactive second generation (AR2G) BLI biosensor tip in 250 µL of water for ten minutes.\nProgram step times, listed in Table 1, on the software controlling the BLI unit (see Table of Materials).\nStart the BLI run by immersing the biosensor tip in 250 µL water for 30 s to measure an initial baseline of biosensor thickness and density.\nActivate the biosensor by immersing the tip into 250 µL 50 mM NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide) and 200 mM EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide)) for 7 minutes.\nImmerse the activated biosensor in 50 mM PDEA (2-(2-pyridinyldithio)ethanamine) dissolved in 0.1 M borate buffer (pH 8.5) for 5 minutes to generate an activated thiol-reactive surface.\nImmerse the activated thiol-reactive biosensor into 250 µL of solution containing 100 nM E126C LFN in 10 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0, 100 mM NaCl, buffer for 5 minutes.\nImmerse the LFN tip in 50 mM L-cysteine, 1 M NaCl, 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, for 4 minutes, to quench any remaining reactive free thiol-reactive groups.\nImmerse the quenched LFN tip in 50 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl for 2 minutes to establish buffer baseline.\nImmerse the quenched LFN tip into 0.5 µM protective antigen prepore (PAprepore), 50 mM Tris, 50mM NaCl for 5 minutes to create the LFN-PAprepore complex.\nOnce PAprepore is associated, remove the tip from the PAprepore solution and immerse the tip into 50 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl for 30 seconds to wash away any non-specifically bound PAprepore.\nImmerse the LFN-PAprepore complex into 0.5 µM CMG2 receptor (without the transmembrane domain), 50 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, for 5 minutes.",
    "Immerse the LFN-PAprepore-CMG2 complex into 50 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl for 30 seconds to wash away any unbound CMG2 to form pre-endosomal complex.\nFor EM analysis, release the LFN-PAprepore-CMG2 complex from the biosensor tip by immersing the tip into 5 µL of 50 mM DTT, 50 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, inside a PCR tube.\nFor tandem MS analysis of the peptides from the complex, release the LFN-PAprepore-CMG2 complex from the biosensor tip by immersing the biosensor into 5 µL 50 mM DTT, 6 M GuHCl (keratin-free), 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.0 inside a PCR tube. This is performed on a different biosensor than the one used for EM analysis.\nAssembly of pore anthrax toxin complex on PDEA-modified amine reactive biosensor surface\nTo view the complex after pH transition, perform steps 1.1.1-1.1.12 in the previous section to generate the LFN-PAprepore-CMG2 complex.\nImmerse the biosensor tip into a 10 mM acetate pH 5.0 for 5 minutes to initiate the transition of the PAprepore to PApore transition. This transition is indicated by increasing amplitude (approximately 0.2 nm) followed by a larger amplitude decline that is hypothesized to be substantial or complete receptor dissociation due to diminished binding affinity.\nImmerse LFN-PApore tip in 50 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, pH 8.0, for 30 seconds to wash off acidic buffer.\nFor the EM analysis sample, immerse the biosensor tip into a solution containing 1.25 mM micelles (2.5 mM MSP1D1, 25 mM Na-cholate, 162.5 mM POPC) for 5 minutes to prevent aggregation in solution after disulfide release.\nFor EM analysis, release the LFN-PApore-Micelle complex from the biosensor tip by immersing the tip into 5 µL of 50 mM DTT, 50 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl inside a PCR tube.",
    "For tandem MS analysis of the peptides from the complex, release the LFN-PApoore complex (no micelle) from the biosensor tip by immersing the biosensor into 5 µL 50 mM DTT, 6 M GuHCl (keratin-free), 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.0 inside a PCR tube. This is performed on a different biosensor than the one used for EM analysis.\n2. Visualizing and Validating Released Macromolecular Assemblies from BLI Biosensors by Negative Stain Electron Microscopy\nGlow discharge a carbon-coated Cu 300 grid. Typical glow discharge settings are 0.38 mBar stable atmosphere pressure, negative 15 mAmps, 20 seconds, then venting with air.\nSecure grid between a pair of clean tweezers.\nPipette 4 µL of released complex sample in PCR tube onto the grid and allow adsorption for 60s.\nWick away remaining liquid with a filter paper wedge.\nStain the grid by pipetting 5 µL of 0.75% 0.02 micron filtered uranyl formate and wicking away excess stain after 5 seconds. Allow grid to dry at room temperature.\nView stained sample grids using a transmission electron microscope.\n3. Identification of Complete Pre-endosomal Anthrax Toxin Complex (LFN-Paprepore-CMG2) and Transitioned Complex (LFN-Papore without CMG2) Using Mass Spectrometry.\nDilute released samples to 20 µL and incubate for 1 hour.\nAdd 2 µL of 55 mM iodoacetamide, 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, and incubate for 1 hour at room temperature in dark (covered with aluminum foil).\nDilute the sample with 100 µL of 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, to reduce the guanidine hydrochloride concentration below 1 M.\nAdd 5 µL of sequencing grade modified trypsin at 20 ng/µL and incubate at 37 °C overnight.\nAdd glacial acetic acid to a final concentration of 5% to reduce the pH to <3, then reduce the volume to 10 µL in vacuum concentrator.",
    "Transfer the peptide solution to the sample plate on the autosampler of the nLC 1200 uHPLC.\nLoad 5 µL the peptide solution onto a uHPLC reversed phase column mounted on the ionization stage of the MS.\nWash column with 15 µL of 0.1% formic acid at a maximum rate of 5 µL/min and/or maximum pressure of 800 psi.\nElute peptides from the reversed-phase C18 column at a flow rate of 350 nL/min over a 90 min period using a lineal gradient of 5% to 40% of solvent B in A+B (solvent A: 0.1% formic acid; solvent B: 95% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid).\nAnalyze eluting peptides on line using tandem MS.\n\t\nSet the ionization source to 2500 volts and ion transfer temperature to 250 °C.\nOperate the mass spectrometer under automatic control to perform continuously one MS scan followed by as many tandem MSMS as possible in a 3 s period, using CID and a normalized collision energy of 35.\nIdentify peptide and protein components using standard methods. For this work, two sets of peptide and protein analysis were performed."
