    "This protocol was developed to ensure that animals are not used needlessly and are spared all unnecessary pain and distress; it adheres to all applicable federal, state, local, and institutional laws and guidelines governing animal research. The protocol was developed under the guidance of a university-wide Laboratory Animal Medicine Program directed by veterinarians specialized in laboratory animal medicine. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n1. Fracture Tower Construction\nNote: All parts are listed in the materials section (Table of Materials). Detailed technical drawings are provided for the machined and 3D-printed parts in Supplementary Figures 1-12. The subassembly technical drawings include fastener details for all mounted parts (Supplementary Figures 1, 2, 7, and 9).\nSupport subassembly\n\tNOTE: For a technical drawing of the support subassembly, see Supplementary Figure 1.\n\t\nAttach the Beam Support--Jaw Section at the midpoint of the Beam Support--Horizontal Section.\nAttach the Beam Support--Vertical 1 to the top surface of the Beam Support--Jaw Section, 2 in from the Beam Support--Horizontal Section.\nAttach the Beam Support--Vertical 2 to the top surface of the Beam Support--Horizontal Section at the midpoint (7 in from the end).\nAttach the Beam, Support--Plate Mount to the end of both Beam Support--Vertical 1 and Beam Support--Vertical 2. The end of the plate support should be flush with the back of Beam Support--Vertical 2.\nRam subassembly\n\tNote: For a technical drawing of the ram subassembly, see Supplementary Figure 2.\n\t\nMachine the Block Stop and the Block Guide (Supplementary Figure 3); the Rod Ram (Supplementary Figure 4); the Screw Alignment (Supplementary Figure 5); and the Plate Mounting (Supplementary Figure 6).\nAttach the Plate Mounting to the Beam Support--Plate Mount of the support subassembly.",
    "In the following order, slide the first Linear Sleeve Bearing; the Block Guide; the second Linear Sleeve Bearing; and the Block Stop on the Rod Ram. Attach the guides and the blocks to the Plate Mounting.\nAttach three ⅜-in nuts to the threaded portion of the Rod Ram. One should be flush with the end of the rod to engage with the electromagnet. The other 2 will be used to adjust the fracture depth.\nAlign the grove in the Rod Ram to face forward and insert the Alignment Screw into the threaded hole of the Block Guide.\nMagnet subassembly\n\tNote: For a technical drawing of the magnet subassembly, see Supplementary Figure 7.\n\t\nSolder the Electromagnet leads to the wire (polarity is not a factor for the electromagnet operation). Allow enough length to reach the floor, where the fracture device will be positioned. Use zip ties or another form of attachment to stress relieve the wire.\nStrip the Power Supply's end and connect it to the Foot Pedal. Finally, connect the wire to the Foot Pedal in an \"off\" (normally open) configuration. Test the circuit to ensure the Electromagnet is on when the Foot Switch is not pressed. This will hold the ram up before the fracture.\nPrint the Mount Magnet (Supplementary Figures 8A and 8B) using an additive manufacturing device, or machine the part from aluminum.\nAttach the Electromagnet to the Mount Magnet.\nAttach 2 Corner Brackets to the Beam Support--Magnet.\nIn the following order, thread the Rod Magnet through the top Corner Bracket and add one ¼-in nut; the Mount Magnet; two ¼-in nuts; and the bottom Corner Bracket. Secure the assembly with two ¼-in nuts on each end.\nComplete assembly\n\tNote: For a technical drawing of the complete assembly, see Supplementary Figure 9.",
    "Attach the Magnet Subassembly to the top surface of the Beam, Support--Plate Mount.\nAdjust the alignment of the Beam Support--Magnet so the magnet engages with the Rod, Ram.\n\t\tNOTE: If the rod does not release when the foot pedal is pressed, reduce the contact area between the electromagnet and the rod by moving the Beam Support--Magnet.\nMachine the Brackets Leg Jaw (Supplementary Figure 10).\nAttach the two Brackets Leg Jaw to the Beam Support--Jaw Section. When dropped, the tip of the ram should be at an equal distance from each jaw.\nPlace the Platform Fracture (Supplementary Figures 11A and 11B) above the jaws.\nPrint the Jig Positioning Fracture (Supplementary Figures 12A and 12B) and the Jig Pin Gauge (Supplementary Figures 13A and 13B) using an additive manufacturing device, or machine the parts from aluminum.\n\t\tNOTE: The dimensions of the Jigs will be calculated in the optimization steps detailed in step 2.\nAttach the Jig Positioning Fracture to the Platform Fracture.\nConfirm that the depth of the impact can be adjusted using the two stop nuts on the Rod Ram.\nConfirm that the speed of the impact can be adjusted by moving the Mount Magnet up and down.\nConfirm that the width of the fracture can be adjusted by moving the Brackets Leg Jaw closer or further away from the Rod Ram.\n2. Fracture Optimization\nFracture location\nObtain radiographs of the limb (femur or tibia) to be fractured in a representative sample of 5 euthanized animals.\n\t\tNOTE: The sample should be matched to the specimens, which will be used in the experimental protocol based on age, genotype, and sex. Even if the final protocol calls for only one fractured limb, both sample limbs will be used.",
    "Position the limb tangential to the x-ray beam to acquire true-lateral and anterior/posterior views to the bone. Place an object of known dimension at the imaging plane to provide a scale for analysis.\nNote: If imaging femurs, ensure the limb is in full extension, where the femur is in the same axial plane as the tibia.\nMark the desired location of the fracture on the radiograph of the limb to be fractured (Figure 1A - dashed line). Measure from the calcaneal-tibial joint to the level of the marked fracture (Figure 1A). Calculate the mean fracture length (FL) for all trial specimens. Measure from the intercondylar notch for femur fractures.\nFracture-positioning jig\nMeasure the distance from the outside surface of one support anvil to the center of the guillotine impact (CGI) (Figure 2). Subtract the CGI from the FL, described in step 2.1.4, to calculate the fracture-positioning jig depth (JD). Machine or 3D-print a U-shaped channel with a height and a width equal to the anvil, and a depth equal to the JD (Figure 3A). A sample technical drawing and CAD file are included in Supplementary Figures 12A and 12B.\n\t\tNOTE: When the limb is placed in the jig, the dorsum of the foot should lie against the surface furthest from the guillotine impact. Modify the U-shaped channel if additional clearance is required for the limb.\nPosition the specimen in the fracture apparatus in the prone position for femur fractures or in the supine position for tibia fractures (Figure 4). Press the dorsum of the foot against the end of the fracture-positioning jig. Manually depress the guillotine until the limb fractures. Obtain a radiograph of the fractured limb to confirm the jig size and fracture location (Figure 2B).",
    "Increase JD if the fracture location is too distal on the bone, or decrease JD if the fracture location is too proximal on the bone.\nStabilization of the pin parameters\nPin length: Using the radiographs obtained in step 2.1, measure the limb length (LL) from the tibial plateau to the level of the posterior malleolus for tibia fractures, or the intercondylar notch to the greater trochanter for femur fractures. Multiply the bone length by 0.9 to calculate the pin length (PL) (Figures 1A and 3B).\nPin Width: Using the radiographs obtained in step 2.1, measure the minimum medullary diameter (MD) in the fractured limb (Figure 1A). Select a needle with a gauge approximately equivalent to the medullary diameter and a length more than 1.5 x PL.\n\t\tNOTE: An approximate pin size for a 14-week-old C57BL/6J mouse is 22 G, 1½ in and 27 G, 1¼ in for femur and tibia, respectively.\nPin cutting gauge\n2.4.1. Machine or 3D-print a gauge with a length equal to PL minus the needle length (CGL) (Figure 3B; Supplementary Figures 13A and 13B). One end should have an overhang to rest against the hub of the needle and the other should indicate where the pin should be cut. A sample technical drawing and CAD file are included in Supplementary Figures 13A and 13B.\nIntramedullary pin fracture stabilization\nUsing the non-fractured trial specimens from step 2.1, remove hair with an electric clipper or depilatory cream from mid-tibia to mid-femur, exposing the knee joint.\nTibia pinning: Insert the needle percutaneously lateral to the patellar ligament. Retract the patellar ligament medially and align the tip of the needle to the axis of the tibia. Using a reaming motion, gently breach the tibial plateau and guide the needle down the medullary cavity.",
    "Femur pinning: Insert the needle percutaneously lateral to the patellar ligament. Retract the patellar ligament medially and align the tip of the needle to the axis of the femur in the intercondylar notch. Using a reaming motion, gently breach the articular surface of the intercondylar notch and guide the needle down the medullary cavity.\nUsing the gauge manufactured in step 2.4, ream until the exposed needle is equal to the gauge length. Retract the needle to provide enough room (~3 mm) to cut the needle at the level indicated by the gauge.\n\t\tNOTE: Be sure to hold the proximal (plastic) end of the needle while cutting, so it does not become a hazardous projectile.\nCrimp 0.3 mm of the distal end of the pin using a pin cutter and then cut the pin at the level of the gauge. Sink the pin to the articular surface using a rod with a diameter 1.5x larger than the diameter of the needle.\n\t\tNOTE: Crimping prevents rotation of the needle and migration by increasing the needle-bone contact.\nObtain radiographs to confirm the needle extends the length of the medullary canal of the limb and does not protrude from the proximal or distal end (Figure 1C).\nImpact depth\nUsing the radiographs obtained in step 2.1, measure the diameter of the cortex at the level of the desired fracture (Figure 1A). Calculate the mean cortical diameter (CD) for all trial specimens.\nPosition a pinned trial specimen from step 2.5 in the fracture device with the fracture-positioning jig manufactured in step 2.2. Rest the impact ram on the uninjured limb.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not allow the ram to drop; the bone should remain intact during this optimization step.",
    "Apply enough downward force on the ram to compress soft tissue, but not fracture the bone. Adjust the impact depth (ID) to 0.75 x CD (Figure 2).\n\t\tNOTE: The ideal impact depth is 0.5 x CD when fracturing a bone without any soft tissue. Using 0.75 accounts for the additional soft-tissue compression.\nAnvil width\nSet the anvil width (AW) to 0.4 cm for the mouse tibia or femur (Figure 2).\n\t\tNOTE: A wider width is recommended for larger specimens such as rats.\nRam weight\nA minimum weight of 250 g is recommended for murine specimens.\n\t\tNOTE: Additional weight can be threaded on to the ram for larger specimens (Figure 2).\nImpact velocity\nSet the drop height (DH) to 2 cm (Figure 2). Position the ram in its starting position by connecting it to the activated electromagnet.\nPosition a trial limb in the fracture apparatus. Press the dorsum of the foot against the fracture-positioning jig manufactured in step 2.2. Briefly depress the footswitch to release the ram and then reset it to its starting position.\nRadiograph the impacted trial limb. Analyze the limb for any evidence of a fracture (Figure 1D).\n\t\tNOTE: This can be subtle when using low velocities with a controlled impact depth.\nIf no fracture is generated, repeat steps 2.9.1 - 2.9.3 and increase the drop height by 2 cm.\nIf a fracture is generated, record the drop height, and multiply it by 1.1. This is the new DH.\nUsing the DH from step 2.9.5, fracture the next trial limb.\nIf no fracture is generated, repeat steps 2.9.1 - 2.9.6 and increase the drop height by 2 cm.",
    "If a fracture is generated, repeat steps 2.9.6 - 2.9.7 until all test samples are used. Record the final DH and all parameters (FL, CGI, JD, PL, MD, PS, CGL, CD, ID, AW, and RW) from the optimization. Record the trial specimens' age, sex, genotype, and weight.\n3. Closed-stabilized Fracture Generation\nSet-up\nSterilize all equipment and instruments via autoclave, hot bead immersion, or their equivalent.\nPlace a heating element on the surgical table and set it to the optimal temperature. Cover the element with a surgical drape. Prepare 3 x 3 in2 of surgical drape with a 0.75-in circle cut out in the middle.\nConfirm the adjustment of the fracture tower before each trial (Figure 2). Set the ID, AW, RW, and DH to the values derived from the optimization protocol specific to the sex, age, and genotype for the specimen to be studied.\nWeigh and record the weight of the animal.\nSurgery\nAdequately sedate the mouse using inhalant anesthetics (isoflurane: 4 - 5% for induction; 1 - 2% for maintenance) or another established laboratory anesthesia protocol. The respiratory rate should be 55 - 100 breaths/min. The animal should not be responsive to a hind-limb toe pinch.\nAdminister the first dose of the postoperative analgesia buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg subcutaneously).\nApply ocular lubrication to prevent corneal drying.\nRemove the animal's hair with an electric clipper from mid-tibia to mid-femur, exposing the knee joint. Clean the site of excess hair using non-reactive tape. Prepare the pinning site with a wet swab moistened with 70% EtOH. Repeat as necessary to remove all hair from the incision area.\nPrepare and clean the pinning area with alternative swabs of povidone-iodine and 70% EtOH. Use two alternative swab sequences to ensure sterility.",
    "A drape is then placed around the surgical site after the skin has been appropriately disinfected.\nPin the limb to be fractured using the protocol described in step 2.5. Acquire radiographs to confirm the pin extends the length of the medullary canal but does not protrude from the proximal or distal end.\nTurn on the electromagnet and connect the impact ram to place it in the starting position.\nPosition the specimen in the fracture apparatus by placing it in a prone position for femur fractures or in a supine position for tibia fractures. The pinned limb should be placed across the anvils and in the fracture-positioning jig with the dorsum of the foot pressed against the outside of the jig.\nWhile pressing the foot with one hand and ensuring only the limb is in the impact ram target area, briefly depress the footswitch to release the ram. Replace the ram in the starting position.\nAcquire radiographs and confirm the fracture location and type.\nPostoperative management\nMonitor the animal every 15 min during its recovery from anesthesia until the animal is conscious, can maintain sternal recumbency, and is ambulatory. Confirm the animal is able to ambulate over a 72-h period.\nHouse the animal individually until it has completely recovered.\nMaintain analgesia over a 48-h period with buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg subcutaneously) administered every 12 h.\nMonitor and record the health status of the animal daily for 7 - 10 d or until euthanasia.\nPost-fracture analysis\nMeasure FL, PL, CD, MD, and the fracture pattern. Record the measurements in a master data file.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
