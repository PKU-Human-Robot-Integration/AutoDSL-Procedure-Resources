    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nGrow S. cerevisiae Strains to Log Phase – Day 1\nTiming: 4–10 h\nThe model organism used in this experiment, S. cerevisiae, is typically grown to log phase to assess the effects of mutations of splicing factors and/or cellular conditions on splicing in vivo when the cells are actively dividing.\nMeasure the optical density (OD) of the prepared yeast cultures following the 8–16 h (overnight) growth, and dilute the cultures to an OD 600 nm of 0.05 to 0.10 in 50 mL of medium in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask. Mix well and confirm the starting OD 600 nm of the cultures.\nGrow S. cerevisiae strains to an OD 600 nm of 0.40 (2–3 doublings). For a wild-type strain, this should take about 4–5 h. Mutants strains will take longer, and approximate incubation times should be calculated according to their doubling time.\nOnce the desired OD 600 nm has been reached, spin down culture in 50mL falcon tubes for 3 min at 2,500 × g. The volume of the cell pellet after growth is about 0.25 mL.\nCarefully remove the media without disturbing the pellet, while leaving about 1 mL at the bottom of the tube. Use the 1mL to resuspend the pellet and transfer it to a 1.5 mL conical screw cap tube.\nSpin down 1.5 mL conical screw cap tube at 18,800 × g for 10 s. Remove remaining media and flash freeze in liquid nitrogen. Store at −80°C until ready for RNA extraction.\nOptional: to ensure complete removal of the culture medium, cell pellets can be washed in water prior to flash freezing.\nNote: Use ethanol resistant markers to label tubes.\nExtract WT Genomic DNA (gDNA) – Day 2\nTiming: 1 h",
    "The WT gDNA will be used to determine the size of the cDNA corresponding to unspliced products for the genes of interest. It is also used as a template to amplify fragments of the PHO85 gene of specific sizes, which are used for the custom size ladder preparation.\nFrom the WT patch streaked on day −2, with a sterile p1000 pipette tip, scrape off some of the cells (collect approximately the size of a match tip) and dip the tip into 1 mL of sterile water.\nNote: Only small amounts of gDNA are needed for this protocol as it is being amplified for the purpose of identifying the size of the unspliced gene products. The final concentration can vary widely from the efficiency of the phenol-chloroform extraction method and how many cells were used. Although, it is not critical that this measurement is precise, the final concentration should lie approximately between 100 ng/μL and 200 ng/μL so that in each PCR reaction, there is approximately between 150 ng and 300 ng of gDNA used.\nIn safe lock tubes, centrifuge 1 min.\nPipette out water.\nAdd 200 μL TE-SDS buffer. Vortex and incubate at 65°C for 5 min.\nAdd 400 μL of TE buffer and 600 μL DNA phenol-chloroform (pH adjusted to 8.0).\nCentrifuge at max speed for 5 min.\nTake top aqueous layer and add to it 900 μL of 100% isopropanol.\nPipette up and down to mix.\nSpin at max speed for 10 min, then carefully pipette out the isopropanol without disturbing the cell pellet.\nWash the pellets with 200 μL 70%–75% ethanol and vortex briefly.\nSpin down at max speed for 1 min, then decant the ethanol.\nAdd 100 μL of water.\nWarm at 95°C until the pellet dissolves.\nCool tubes to approximately 25°C and briefly spin down.",
    "Mix until gDNA is fully resuspended.\nPrepare the Fluorescently Labeled Custom Size Ladder for Size Determination\nTiming: 4 h\nThe ladder will be used to determine the sizes of the PCR products on the gel. It is generated by amplifying multiple fragments of specific sizes of the PHO85 gene using one reverse Cy3-labeled primer, and multiple forward primers (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). This results in the production of Cy3 labeled DNA products of specific sizes which can be visualized after electrophoresis using the Bio-Rad imager and the Quantity One software. This strategy can be applied to generate any products of specific size; different genes can also be used to generate the ladder.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/214-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Generating a Size Ladder by Multi-Primer PCR\nThe size ladder is created using PCR reactions generating various fragments of the S. cerevisiae PHO85 gene.\nLadder DNA sequences ranging in size from 40 to 500 bp were created using 13 different forward primers in combination with one Cy3 labeled reverse primer. The appropriate sizes can be included into the gel analysis depending on the predicted product sizes.\nPrepare a PCR for each size fragment of the ladder. Extension time may be adjusted based on the size of the products.\nCreate a 5 μM forward/reverse primer mix making a 50 μL stock solution for each ladder size.\nNote: It is recommended to generate as many reactions as possible such that the ladder samples can be used in multiple experiments.\nFor PCR include:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_214_12.csv\nRun the PCR using these conditions:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_214_13.csv",
    "Note: The PCR products can be checked on an agarose gel before running it on acrylamide to ensure that the reaction worked efficiently. We typically do not purify the PCR products to remove primer dimers, as these will generally run lower than the smaller fragments we detect compared to our size ladder.\nExtract Total RNAs from S. cerevisiae\nTiming: 4–6 h\nThis experiment is performed to analyze splicing efficiency in vivo and to visualize differently spliced RNA isoforms are produced under certain conditions or in the context of specific RNA processing or splicing factors mutations. RNAs are first extracted, and cDNAs are then generated such that they can undergo amplification via PCR.\nTo the cell pellets that were previously flash-frozen and stored in the 1.5 mL conical screw cap tubes, add 400 mL glass beads, 350 μL of RNA buffer, 350 μL of RNA/SDS buffer, and 700 μL of RNA Phenol-Chloroform (pH 6.7). The final concentration should be between 5 and 10 μg/μL per reaction.\nVortex 1 min. Heat at 65°C for 6 min.\nVortex 1 min. Spin down at 18,800 × g for 5 min.\nCritical: Use snap lock tubes for following Phenol-Chloroform steps as well as ethanol resistant markers to label tubes. Phenol/chloroform dissolves latex laboratory gloves, so change gloves if they become soiled with phenol/chloroform.\nTake top 450 μL aqueous layer and add to 450 μL fresh RNA Phenol-Chloroform (pH 6.7).\nVortex 1 min and spin at 21,400 × g for 2 min.\nTake top 400 μL aqueous layer and add to 1 mL 100% ethanol and 40 μL 3 M NaOAc pH 5.2\nCool at −80°C for 30 min\nNote: 3 M NaoAc pH 5.2 was made using the Cold Spring Harbor Protocol for Sodium Acetate (Sodium Acetate, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).",
    "Pause Point: Samples can be stored at −80°C for several months.\nSpin down at max speed for 10 min.\nRemove supernatant and wash pellet in 500 μL 70% ethanol. Spin at max speed for 5 min.\nResuspend RNA in 20–50 μL nuclease free water while on ice.\nDetermine the resuspended RNA concentration (aim for 5–10 μg/μL)\nCritical: Keep samples on ice to prevent RNA degradation.\nNote: Best practices for handling RNAs involves maintaining a dedicated RNase-free workspace. Avoid using pipettes that have previously been used for experiments involving the use of Ribonucleases. The combination of high pH and high temperatures promotes RNA degradation, so using close to neutral pH and cold temperatures prevents RNA degradation.\nDNase Treatment of Total RNAs – Day 3\nTiming: 4–5 h\nThe extracted total RNAs will be reverse transcribed into cDNAs, so it is important to digest any contaminant DNA so that PCR products derive only from cDNAs and not gDNA.\nNote: Reaction can be scaled down as necessary if you do not have enough RNAs.\nCritical: Use snap lock tubes for following Phenol-Chloroform steps as well as ethanol resistant markers to label tubes.\nTake 40 μg of RNA and add 20 μL of 10× Turbo DNase buffer, 4 μL of 2 U/μL Ambion RNase-free Turbo DNase. Add nuclease free water to 200 μL.\nMix and incubate at 37°C for 45 min.\nAdd 200 μL RNA Phenol-Chloroform (pH 6.7) and vortex 1 min.\nSpin at max speed for 5 min.\nTo your tube, add 200 μL RNA Phenol-Chloroform (pH 6.7).\nVortex 1 min and spin at max speed for 5 min.\nTake top aqueous layer and add to 1 mL 100% ethanol, 40 μL 3 M NaOAc pH 5.2,\nOptional: Add 1 μL GlycoBlue to assist with visualization of the RNA pellet.",
    "Cool at −80°C for 30 min\nRemove supernatant and wash pellet in 500 μL 70% ethanol. Spin at max speed for 5 min. Remove supernatant, air dry RNA pellet.\nResuspend RNA in 10–20 μL nuclease free water while on ice.\nMeasure the resuspended RNA concentration.\ncDNA Synthesis Using Invitrogen M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase and Random Hexamers\nTiming: 1–2 h\ncDNAs are prepared from the extracted RNA so that PCR amplification of the desired genes can occur. Random hexamers are used to ensure efficient cDNA synthesis of all RNAs.\nIn PCR tubes, combine 5 μg DNase treated RNA, 0.4 μL dNTPs (25 mM each), 1 μL 50 ng/μL random hexamers, and nuclease free water to 12 μL. The dNTP solution can be added during step 37 to improve efficiency of the cDNA synthesis step as dNTPs are more prone to degradation at high temperatures.\nHeat at 65°C for 5 min to ensure the denaturation of RNA secondary structures that might prevent efficient annealing of the primers, then put on ice for 2 min.\nWhile on ice, add to the PCR tubes 4 μL 5× First Strand Buffer, 2 μL 0.1 M DTT, 1 μL RNase Inhibitor (40 U/μL), and 1 μL (200 U/μL) M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase.\nIncubate at 25°C for 10 min, then 37°C for 50 min, then 70°C for 15 min.\nOptional: Add 1 μL RNase H and incubate 37°C for 20 min.\nNote: RNase H removes any RNAs that remain bound to the cDNAs after the reverse transcription step. Doing this can improve the sensitivity and efficiency of the PCR in the next step. The data presented in this protocol did not include RNase H in the experiments.",
    "Note: Avoid frequent freezing/ thawing of dNTPs by aliquoting small amounts from the stock solution into flex tubes to be used for experiments. After thawing the aliquots, vortex thoroughly.\nPCR Amplification of the cDNAs – Day 4\nTiming: 3 h\nGene-specific Cy3-labeled primers are used with Taq Polymerase to amplify the cDNA of interest so that they can be analyzed via Quantity One by Bio-Rad.\nFor PCR include:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_214_14.csv\nRun the PCR using these conditions:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_214_15.csv\nNote: The PCR products can be checked on an agarose gel before running it on acrylamide to ensure the reaction worked efficiently.\nOnce the PCR reaction is complete, add 25 μL of 2× formamide dye to the PCR tubes. Heat them at 83°C for 5 min for denaturation.\nChoose the appropriate ladder size samples for the predicted product.\nTake 2 μL of each appropriate size sample and combine in a PCR tube for a total of 10 μL. Add 10 μL 2× formamide dye to the PCR tubes. Heat them at 83°C for 5 min for denaturation.\nSet Up the Gel Apparatus and Pour the Gel – Day 5\nTiming: 10 min\nNote: These instructions were written with reference to the Bio-Rad Sequi-Gen GT System (Bio-Rad #1653860), but any appropriately sized sequencing gel apparatus may be used (outlined in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/214-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Acrylamide Gel Set-Up\nTo set up the Bio-Rad Sequi-Gen GT System (Bio-Rad #1653860) gel for RT-PCR gel fractionations, these steps need to be followed.",
    "The surfaces need to be prepared by applying 70% ethanol to the inner sides of both plates and water repellent on the inner side of the top plate. The spacers need to be installed next and the side clamps placed on where the rods face backward. The bottom reservoir trough is then placed on the gel apparatus and the spacers are installed between the plates at the top.\nClean the interfaces of the gel plates using 70% ethanol. Treat the inner face of the top plate with a water repellent.\nNote: To check for possible leakage before acrylamide is poured, water can be poured into the fully set up gel apparatus prior to the treatment of water repellent.\nCritical: It is important not to treat both plates with water repellent for minimal slipping of the gel when it starts running.\nTo set up the gel-running apparatus, position the spacers on either side of the plates then place the ethanol cleaned sides facing inward.\nStand the plates up and add side clamps with the rods facing backward. Close the clamps tightly.\nPlace the bottom of the apparatus into the cassette and press firmly onto the foam pad.\nInsert the well comb in between the two plates with enough room at the top for the acrylamide to empty out between the lanes.\nPrepare the Gel\nTiming: 2–3 h\nThe PCR product must be fractionated on 5%–8% sequencing-type acrylamide gels to ensure distinct separation of products down to 1 nucleotide in difference. Larger products between 350 and 500 bp separate better at lower percentage gels while smaller products between 40 and 350 bp separate better at higher percentages.",
    "In a 250 mL graduated cylinder, combine: 120 mL of the proper percentage denaturing acrylamide solution, 1 mL fresh 10% APS (or 750 μL for 8%–10% gel), and 200 μL TEMED (or 150 μL for 8%–10% gel).\nWith parafilm over the top of the cylinder, invert three times to mix.\nWith the plunger detached from the 300 mL syringe, make sure the tubing is attached on one side to the tip of the syringe and on the other to the tip adapter. Hold the end of the tip adapter side of the tubing above the highest point on the syringe while pinching the end closed to prevent leakage and pour the mixture from the cylinder into the open end of the syringe.\nAllow a small volume of the mixture to run out of the tube to clear out any air.\nNote: In solution, APS degrades over time and should be stored at 4°C for up to 3 weeks.\nCritical: It is important to move quickly to prevent the gel from solidifying before it is fully poured. 8%–10% percentage gels polymerize faster than 5%.\nNote: If air bubbles are forming in the gel, gently tapping the gel while pouring can prevent or remove these bubbles. If there is excessive leaking, dissemble the gel apparatus and thoroughly clean all the components. Ensure that there is no hardened acrylamide anywhere in the side clamps or the bottom reservoir and reassemble pressing everything together tightly.\nConnect the syringe tube tip adapter into the hole at the bottom stopper to allow the gel mixture to flow into the plates. Gently tap the glass to prevent air bubbles from forming as the gel flows.\nOnce the gel has polymerized, clean out any leaked or spilled acrylamide that might have fallen into the buffer space.",
    "After about 30 min, when the gel has polymerized remove the bottom stopper from the apparatus, add about 1 inch of 1× TBE to the bottom buffer reservoir then carefully place the clamped gel apparatus into the reservoir.\nAdd the bracer to prevent the plates from swinging.\nAdd 1× TBE to the top of the gel and allow it to flow down and occupy the buffer space behind the rear gel plate.\nCarefully and evenly remove the well comb.\nUsing a syringe, wash out the wells using 1× TBE and make sure no bubbles remain.\nConnect the leads to the gel apparatus and place the top cap electrodes onto the gel cassette.\nPre-run the gel at 150 W until it reaches 55°C. Once at temperature, reduce the power down to 120 W. Using a syringe, wash out the wells using 1× TBE once more to make sure no bubbles remain and that the wells are free of urea.\nUsing the center wells, load 5 to 16 μL of each sample into the gel.\nRun the gel at 120 W until the dye front reaches 3/4 of the way down the gel.\nNote: Depending on the size of the products and how many alternative products are present, the gel may need to be run longer to ensure proper separation.\nDry the Gel\nTiming: 1.5 h\nThe results of the experiment will be analyzed using the Bio-Rad imager and the Quantity One software, which requires a dried product to prevent distortions and to prevent hardened acrylamide from being inserted in the machine. Drying is also important so that the gel can be preserved.",
    "After the gel has finished running, disassemble the apparatus and pour out the buffer. Carefully remove the gel from the running rig, keeping the two gel clamps on the sides of the plate.\nCool the gel to approximately 20°C–25°C by running cold tap water over the gel plates and inside the buffer reservoir in the rear plate.\nRemove the clamps and gently lift off the top plate. The gel should stick to the bottom plate.\nPlace a sheet of Whatman paper on the gel, smooth side down, and push down gently to ensure good, even contact. Lift the Whatman paper off the plate with the gel stuck to it.\nCritical: Do not allow that Whatman paper to get too wet, or the gel will begin to ripple and distort.\nPlace a sheet of saran wrap over the gel, taking care to minimize the number of wrinkles that form in the saran wrap. Gently press out air bubbles between the saran wrap and the gel.\nWhile sandwiched between the Whatman paper and saran wrap, cut off the wells at the top of the gel as well as just above the dye at the bottom of the gel.\nPlace the cut gel still sandwiched between the Whatman paper and saran wrap, between another pair of Whatman papers. Place sandwich onto the mesh surface of the gel dryer.\nDry the gel for 1 h at 80°C.\nPlace the gel in the Bio-Rad imager for imaging."
