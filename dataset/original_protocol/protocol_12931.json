    "1. Isolate Template Plasmids from E. coli\nGrow E. coli containing the template plasmid overnight in 10 ml lysogeny broth (LB) + 200 mg/L ampicillin (AMP) at 37 °C with shaking.\nHarvest cells by centrifuging at 6,000 x g for 2 min.\nDecant liquid, isolate and purify DNA from E. coli cells by a standard method as described previously in Ausubel et al.8.\nResuspend DNA in Tris-EDTA (TE; 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) at a working concentration of 50-100 ng/ml.\n2.

Bold italicized text indicates homology to the ENO1 genomic locus, normal font regions are homologous to plasmid DNA.\nDesign primers to be homologous to plasmid sequences bordering the cassette to be amplified as well as to the 3'-end of the target gene of interest (e.g. ENO1) to facilitate recombination into the gene's genomic locus (Figure 2 and Table 1).\n\t\nEnsure that the forward primer sequences match the last 70 base pairs (bp) of the gene of interest, 5'- 3', minus the stop codon, to maintain the coding frame, plus the first approximately 30 bp of the plasmid sequence to be amplified. As a note, the GGTGGTGGTT in each primer is a poly-glycine linker with no FP homology. Of note, in the absence of a linker, there can be direct fusion of functional domains, which can theoretically lead to protein misfolding, low yield in protein production, or impaired bioactivity.",
    "Ensure that the reverse primer sequences are 70 bp just downstream of gene, 3'- 5', not including any gene sequence, plus the last approximately 30 bp of the nutritional or drug resistance marker used in the plasmid.\nUse F1 and R1 to generate GFP-NAT1 and YFP-NAT1 cassettes with pMG2120 and pMG2263, respectively and F2 and R2 to generate mCherry-NAT1 with pMG2343.\n3. Generate FP Cassettes by PCR (Day 1)\nPrepare reagents for PCR. Make a master mix (500 µl final volume) by adding the following volumes and concentrations to a 1.5 ml tube: 50 µl PCR buffer (500 mM potassium chloride, 100 mM Tris pH 8.0 in water), 20 µl deoxynucleotides (dNTPs; stock mixture of nucleotides at 10 mM each), 40 µl 25 mM magnesium chloride, 20 µl purified plasmid (from ~50-100 ng/µl stock solution), 10 µl each forward and reverse primer (from 10 mM stock solutions), 30 µl Taq polymerase (generic, 5,000 units/ml), and 320 µl water.\n\t\nAliquot 50 µl of master mix into each of 10 PCR-compatible 0.5 ml tubes.\nPlace PCR tubes in thermocycler and run the following steps: 1 cycle of 5 min at 94 °C to denature dsDNA; 40 cycles sequentially of 45 sec at 94 °C, 30 sec at 55 °C to allow primers to anneal to plasmid template DNA, and 4 min at 68 °C for extension of DNA products; and 1 final extension cycle of 15 min at 72 °C.\n\tNOTE: The PCR master mix and cycling parameters may need to be modified based on the particular Taq polymerase used.\nPool all products from the 10 PCR reactions in a 1.5 ml tube.",
    "Subject 5 µl of pooled PCR product to agarose gel electrophoresis to verify amplicon size and obtain an estimate of product concentration, based on comparison to a DNA ladder. Generally, use ~250 µg of cassette DNA in each subsequent transformation mix.\nPrecipitate DNA by adding 50 µl 3 M sodium acetate followed by 750 µl 95% ethanol to the products and incubate at least 30 min at -20° C.\nHarvest the PCR products by centrifuging the tube at 16,000 x g for 10 min. Carefully remove and discard the supernatant and dry the pellet overnight. Resuspend the dried DNA cassette pellet in 40 µl TE pH 8.0 and store at room temperature until use.\n4. Transform Candida Cells with FP DNA Cassettes\nOn Day 1, recover yeast strain to be transformed from a 15% glycerol frozen (-80 °C) stock by streaking a few scraped crystals onto yeast peptone dextrose with adenine (YPAD) agar and incubate at 30 °C. After recovery of colony growth, inoculate a single colony into 2 ml liquid YPAD medium in a glass culture tube with a breathable cap and incubate overnight at 30 °C with agitation.\nOn Day 2, dilute 300 µl of overnight yeast culture into 50 ml fresh YPAD (to a final OD600 of ~0.2) in a 125 ml Erlenmeyer flask with a breathable cap. Shake at 30 °C for ~3 hr (to a final OD600 ~0.6-0.8).\n\t\nPour the overnight culture into a 50 ml conical tube and pellet the cells by spinning for 5 min at 1 500 x g in a table top centrifuge.\nPour off and properly discard the supernatant. Resuspend the cell pellet in 5 ml water. Re-pellet the cells by centrifuging again for 5 min at 1,500 x g in a table top centrifuge.",
    "Pour off and properly discard the supernatant. Resuspend the cells in 500 µl TELiAc (TE lithium acetate: 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1 M lithium acetate) while transferring to a 1.5 ml tube. Centrifuge the tube for 2 min at 3,000 x g in a microcentrifuge.\nResuspend cells in 250 µl TELiAc. The total volume including the pellet should be ~300 µl.\nTo a clean (different microfuge tube than in 4.2.4), add 5 µl carrier DNA (10 mg/ml) and 150 µl of prepared Candida cells (from 4.2.4). This is the negative control for transformation.\n\t\nTo a second clean microfuge tube, add 5 µl of denatured carrier DNA (that has been boiled at 90 °C for 10 min and cooled to 4 °C), all 40 µl of the prepared PCR product (from 3.3.1) and 150 µl of prepared Candida cells (from 4.2.4).\nIncubate the two transformation mixes for 30 min at room temperature.\nTo each transformation mix tube, add 700 µl PLATE mix (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1 M lithium acetate in 50% polyethylene glycol 3350). Invert the tubes to mix and incubate them overnight at RT.\nOn Day 3, incubate the transformation mixes at 42 °C for 1 hr (heat shock).\n\t\nCentrifuge the transformation mixes for 30 sec at 16,000 x g in a microcentrifuge. Remove and properly discard the supernatant. Resuspend each of the cell pellets in 150 µl water by gently pipetting up and down so as to not to damage the cells.\nFor transformations utilizing auxotrophic marker genes (e.g. URA3), plate each entire mixture by pipetting the solutions onto the appropriate selective media agar (e.g. lacking uridine) and spread the mixture evenly using sterile glass beads.",
    "For transformations utilizing the nourseothricin resistance marker gene (NAT1), as described here, plate transformation mixes first onto non-selective YPAD agar and incubate at 30 °C for 6-12 hr. This step aids in cell recovery, post heat shock, before nourseothricin stress is applied.\nAfter partial growth recovery, replica plate the Candida cells onto YPAD containing 400 µg/ml nourseothricin. For transformations utilizing nutritional marker genes (e.g. URA3), this intermediate plating step is not needed and cells can be directly plated onto selective yeast media (e.g. YPAD lacking uridine) as described in 4.4.2.\n\t\tNOTE: If the transformation is successful, colonies should appear within one to three days (potentially up to five days of outgrowth for selection on nourseothricin-containing agar). No colonies should appear on plates spread with transformation mixes containing carrier DNA alone (negative control).\nFor auxotrophic and nourseothricin marker selection, streak putative transformants as single colonies to fresh selective media agar plates and incubate at 30 °C to propagate yeast cells that can be screened for successful construction of FP fusions.\nScreen transformants for correct integration of the tagging cassette (see Representative Results for a detailed example). If the gene of interest is expressed at sufficient amounts, whole colony fluorescence may occur such that it is possible to detect potential candidate integrants using a plate imaging system with fluorescence detection ability.\n\t\nCheck putative integrants by PCR using primers homologous to sequences outside of the region of integration to confirm fusion to the target gene.\nIn addition, consider Western blot analysis to determine the expression and size of the fusion protein, as well as by fluorescence microscopy of single cells for visual confirmation of protein localization, if known.\nSubscription Required.
