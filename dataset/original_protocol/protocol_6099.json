    "Reagent Preparation (Mouse Phospho-RTK Array Kit) Note: Bring all reagents to room temperature before use. Mouse Phospho-RTK ArrayFour nitrocellulose membranes each containing 39 different anti-RTK antibodies printed in duplicate. Handle arrays only with gloved hands and flat-tipped tweezers. Anti-Phospho-Tyrosine-HRP Detection Antibody: 50 μl of mouse anti-phospho-tyrosine antibody conjugated to HRPImmediately before use, dilute the Detection Antibody to the working concentration specified on the vial label using 1x Array Buffer 2.Note: Prepare only as much Detection Antibody as needed to run each experiment. Lysis Buffer 17 (see Recipe 5)1x Array Buffer 2 (see Recipe 6)1x Wash Buffer (see Recipe 7)Chemi Reagent Mix (see Recipe 8)Sample PreparationExcise by dissection and disrupt 1-5 mg of tumor tissue (approx 0.2-0.3 cm3) using TissueRuptor II in 1 ml Lysis Buffer 17 prepared with protease inhibitors. Centrifuge samples at 10,621 x g for 10 min at 4 °C in an Eppendorf Centrifuge 5810R. Collect supernatant and quantified protein concentrations in tumor lysates using the PierceTM BCA Protein Assay Kit.Notes: The suggested starting range for tissue lysates is 100-300 μg and the maximum allowable lysate volume is 250 μl/array.  Tissue lysates should be used immediately or aliquoted and stored at ≤ -70 °C. Thawed lysates should be kept on ice prior to use.Array ProcedureNote: Bring all reagents to room temperature before use. Keep samples on ice. To avoid contamination, wear gloves while performing the procedures. Prepare all reagents and samples as directed in the previous sections. Pipette 2.0 ml of Array Buffer 1 into each well of the 4-well Multi-dish that will be used. Array Buffer 1 is used as a block buffer. Using flat-tip tweezers, remove each array to be used from between the protective sheets. Place one array into each well of the 4-well Multi-dish. The array number should be facing upward.",
    "Note: Upon contact with Array Buffer 1 the blue dye will disappear from the spots. The capture antibodies are retained in their specific locations. Incubate for 1 h at room temperature on a rocking platform shaker. Orient the tray so that each array rocks from end to end in its well. While the arrays are blocking, prepare samples by diluting the desired quantity of lysate in 1.25 ml of Array Buffer 1. Adjust to a final volume of 1.5 ml with Lysis Buffer 17 as necessary. The maximum allowable lysate volume is 250 μl/array. Aspirate Array Buffer 1 from the 4-well Multi-dish. Add the prepared samples and place the lid on the 4-well Multi-dish. Incubate overnight at 2-8 °C on a rocking platform shaker. Note: A shorter incubation time may be used if optimal sensitivity is not required.  Carefully remove each array and place into individual plastic containers with 20 ml of 1x Wash Buffer. Rinse the 4-well Multi-dish with deionized or distilled water and dry thoroughly. Wash each array with 1x Wash Buffer for 10 min on a rocking platform shaker. Repeat two times for a total of three washes. Dilute the Anti-Phospho-Tyrosine-HRP Detection Antibody in 1x Array Buffer 2 using the dilution factor on the vial label. Pipette 2.0 ml into each well of the 4-well Multi-dish. Carefully remove each array from its wash container. Allow excess buffer to drain from the array. Return the array to the 4-well Multi-dish containing the Anti-Phospho-Tyrosine-HRP and cover with the lid. Incubate for 2 h at room temperature on a rocking platform shaker. Wash each array as described in Steps C9 and C10. Note: Complete the remaining steps without interruption.  Carefully remove each membrane from its wash container.",
    "Allow excess Wash Buffer to drain from the membrane by blotting the lower edge onto paper towels. Place each membrane on the bottom sheet of the plastic sheet protector with the identification number facing up. Pipette 1 ml of the prepared Chemi Reagent Mix evenly onto each membrane. Note: Using less than 1 ml of Chemi Reagent Mix per membrane may result in incomplete membrane coverage.  Carefully cover with the top sheet of the plastic sheet protector. Gently smooth out any air bubbles and ensure Chemi Reagent Mix is spread evenly to all corners of each membrane. Incubate for 1 min. Position paper towels on the top and sides of the plastic sheet protector containing the membranes and carefully squeeze out excess Chemi Reagent Mix. Remove the top plastic sheet protector and carefully lay an absorbent lab wipe on top of the membranes to blot off any remaining Chemi Reagent Mix. Leaving membranes on the bottom plastic sheet protector, cover the membranes with plastic wrap taking care to gently smooth out any air bubbles. Wrap the excess plastic wrap around the back of the sheet protector so that the membranes and sheet protector are completely wrapped. Place the membranes with the identification numbers facing up in an autoradiography film cassette. Note: Use an autoradiography cassette that is not used with radioactive isotope detection. Expose membranes CL-XPosureTM Film. Multiple exposure times are recommended (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190415/20190415031024_2000.jpgFigure 1.
