Prepare 0.2% BSA by diluting 750 µL of 4% BSA in 14.25 mL of D-PBS.",
    "Prepare 0.4% DNAse stock by adding 1 mL of Earle's balanced salt solution (EBSS) per 12,500 units of DNAse, filter sterilize (0.22 µm), aliquot, and store at -20 °C. Prepare panning buffer (0.02% BSA) by adding 3 mL of 0.2% BSA and 100 µL of 0.4% DNAse in 27 mL of D-PBS. Prepare primary antibodies (CD45, PDGRFβ, O4).\n\t\tNOTE: This protocol uses an O4 hybridoma8,9, however, 10 µg of a commercially available O4 antibody would also be appropriate.\nPrepare the combination collagenase stock by dissolving a bottle of combination collagenase (50 mg) in 5 mL of HBSS-/-, aliquot, and store at -20 °C. Prepare a working stock per two mice by adding 500 µL of warmed combination collagenase and 50 µL of warmed 0.4% DNase to 4.5 mL of HBSS-/-.\nPrepare low ovomucoid by adding 3 g of BSA to 150 mL of D-PBS, then add 3 g of trypsin inhibitor and mix to dissolve. Adjust the pH to 7.4 and bring the volume up to 200 mL with D-PBS. Filter sterilize, prepare 1 mL aliquots, and store at -20 °C. On the day of dissection, combine 1 mL of low ovomucoid in 9 mL of D-PBS for the working solution.\nPrepare 15% BSA by dissolving 7.5 g of BSA in 50 mL of HBSS-/- (place on a shaker to dissolve fully), filter sterilize, and store at 4 °C.",
    "Prepare 50 mL of neuron media by adding 23.2 mL of DMEM, 23.2 mL of neurobasal medium, 500 µL of glutamax, 500 µL of sodium pyruvate, 500 µL of penicillin/streptomycin (aliquot immediately upon arrival and store at -20 °C) , 500 µL of insulin (5 µg/mL final), 500 µL of SATO, 50 µL of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC; 5 µg/mL final), and 1,000 µL of B27+ (immediately aliquot and store at -20 °C upon receiving).\n\t\t\nPrepare the insulin stock by dissolving in culture grade water to a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL (50 mg in 100 mL), adjust the pH to 7.4, filter sterilize (0.22 µm), prepare 500 µL aliquots, and store at -20 °C.\nPrepare the SATO stock by combining 20 µL of progesterone (2.5 mg in 100 µL of ethanol), 800 µL of sodium selenite (4 mg in 10 mL of neurobasal media + 10 µL of 1 N NaOH), 800 mg of BSA, 800 mg of transferrin, 128 mg of putrescine dihydrochloride, and 80 mL of neurobasal. Filter sterilize (0.22 µm), prepare 500 µL aliquots, and store at -20 °C. It is essential to make fresh progesterone and sodium selenite solutions.\nPrepare 50 µL of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) stock by dissolving in neurobasal medium to a stock concentration of 5 mg/mL (50 mg in 10 mL), filter sterilize (0.22 µm), aliquot, and store at -20 °C.\nFor day 4 and 5, prepare the following reagents.\n\t\nPrepare 0.2 M phosphate buffer (PB) by dissolving 21.8 g of sodium phosphate dibasic (Na2HPO4) and 8.34 g of sodium phosphate monobasic dihydrate (NaH2PO4) in 1,000 mL of water. Adjust the pH to 7.4 and store at room temperature.",
    "Prepare 8% paraformaldehyde (PFA) as follows: in a fume hood, warm 50 mL of water to 55 °C, turn off the heat, and add 8 g of PFA prills, stirring constantly. Add 1 N NaOH dropwise until the solution begins to clear, then add 40 mL of 0.2 M PB, and continue stirring until clear. Cool the solution to room temperature, adjust the pH to 7.4, and bring the volume up to 100 mL with 0.2 M PB. Filter and store at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks.\nPrepare D-PBS + Triton X-100 (PBSTX) by adding 0.2% Triton X-100 in culture grade D-PBS (1 mL of Triton + 500 mL of D-PBS). Store at 4 °C.

Equipment setup\nSet up the following equipment: sterile cell culture biosafety cabinet, micropipette set, serological pipettes and pipette gun, 10 cm Petri dishes, desired cell culture dishes for plating (here, 24-well black glass-bottom plates were used for imaging), 15 mL and 50 mL conical tubes, dissection tools (namely: fine spring scissors for laminectomy and nerve trimming, fine forceps, and a razor blade), water bath set to 37 °C, 70 µm cell strainer, centrifuge (10 min at 300 x g) with adaptors for 15 mL conical tubes, trypan blue and haemocytometer, fume hood, and magnetic stirring hot plate.\n3. Experimental method\nDay 1: preparation of dishes",
    "In a biosafety cabinet, coat the desired culture surface with enough poly-D-lysine to cover the bottom of the well. Store overnight at 4 °C. Here, 24-well glass-bottom plates were used for imaging, and thus 300 µL of poly-D-lysine was used.\nIn a biosafety cabinet, prepare the panning dishes: for the CD45 dish, add 10 mL of working tris-HCl solution and 30 µL of goat anti-rat IgG to a 10 cm Petri dish; for the PDGFRβ dish, add 10 mL of working tris-HCl solution and 30 µL of goat anti-rabbit IgG to a 10 cm Petri dish; for the O4 hybridoma dish, add 10 mL of working tris-HCl solution and 30 µL of goat anti-mouse IgG to a 10 cm Petri dish. Ensure the solution covers the entire dish area and leave at 4 °C overnight.\nDay 2: dissection, trituration, and immunopanning\n\t\nAspirate the poly-D-lysine, wash the plates three times with tissue culture water, tilt the lid open, and allow the surface to dry completely in a biosafety cabinet. Apply enough laminin to the plates to coat the bottom of each well, and place in an incubator at 37 °C. For the 24-well plates, 200 µL is sufficient.\nFinish preparing the panning dishes. Wash each dish with D-PBS and incubate with 10 µg of primary antibody. Allow to sit at room temperature for at least 2 h.\nFor the CD45 dish, add 5 mL of 0.2% BSA and 20 µL of CD45 primary; for the PDGFRβ dish, add 5 mL of 0.2% BSA and 15.4 µL of PDGFRβ; for the O4 dish, add 3 mL of 0.2% BSA, 2 mL of O4 hybridoma, and an additional 100 µL of 4% BSA (to ensure the final BSA concentration remains at 0.2%).",
    "Euthanize one to four mice using 0.1 mL/kg sodium pentobarbitol (per 10 cm immunopanning dish). We used C57BL/6 mice at 8-10 weeks old. Both sexes were used and cultured separately from one another. Perfuse the animal with 30 mL of cold 0.9% saline.\nPin the front and hind paws to a styrofoam stage and use a clean razor blade to expose the spinal column from the back. Perform a laminectomy by making cuts about half-way deep on either side of the dorsal spinal column, removing the dorsal half of the column, to expose the spinal cord. Either gently cut the nerves and remove the spinal cord, or gently push the cord to the side, maintaining the nerve integrity.\nUse the spinal nerve roots (either severed or attached to the spinal cord) to find and remove all the DRGs from either side of the spinal column. Trim the nerve debris from each DRG as it is removed (more nerve debris in the culture may lead to poor culture survival). Collect the DRGs in 15 mL of HBSS-/- in a 15 mL conical tube on ice.\n\t\tNOTE: Note that the tissue is dissected in open air, but once the DRGs are added to the tube they should be treated as sterile and only manipulated in a biosafety cabinet.\nPlace frozen stocks of stemxyme 1 and 0.4% DNAse in a water bath, approximately 30 min prior to the end of the dissections (roughly when starting the last mouse). Allow them to settle to the bottom of the conical tube, then continue the protocol in a biosafety cabinet.\nAspirate most of the HBSS-/- from the DRGs. Use a pipette rather than suction to get <1 mL of liquid, and leave ~100 µL liquid so as not to risk losing tissue.",
    "Wash three times with 1 mL of HBSS-/-. Add 5 mL of working stemxyme solution to the tissue. Cover the lid with a transparent film and float the tube on its side in a water bath set to 37 °C for 1 h.\nAfter incubation in the enzyme, add 1 mL of low ovo inhibitor solution to the tube. Triturate the cells gently with a p1000 pipette 10-15 times. Allow the tissue chunks to settle.\nTransfer the top 2-3 mL of solution (containing dissociated cells) to fresh low ovomucoid solution. Repeat until the tissue is fully dissociated and no visible chunks remain.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 300 x g at room temperature. Siphon off the supernatant again, using a pipette rather than suction for the last 1 mL, leaving ~100 µL, and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of panning buffer.\nGently pipette to mix. Pre-wet a 70 µm cell strainer with 1 mL of panning buffer over a 50 mL conical tube. Filter the cell solution through the cell strainer.\nWash the tube with 1 mL of panning buffer, then pass through the strainer (3 mL of filtrate). Layer the cell suspension gently (1 mL at a time) on top of 2 mL of a 15% BSA cushion to remove myelin debris. A 2 mL cushion is effective for two mice, and 3 mL is effective for four mice.\n\t\t\nFor layering, place the 2 mL of BSA in the tube, close, and gently coat the sides of the tube with BSA. Then, gently layer the cell suspension of top, by pipetting against the side of the tube.",
    "Centrifuge at room temperature at 300 x g for 10 min (slow acceleration and deceleration). Use a P1000 pipette to remove the clear liquid on top, the myelin phase in between, and the BSA, 1 mL at a time (changing tips in between each mL). Leave ~100 µL of BSA so as not to disturb the pellet.\nAdd 5 mL of panning buffer and incubate the tube in a 37 °C, 10% CO2 incubator for 30-45 min. This allows for antigen retrieval. Be sure to loosen the cap to allow gas exchange.\nWash the CD45 dish three times with D-PBS. Pour off the final rinse. Decant the cell suspension into the CD45 dish.\nIncubate the cells on the CD45 dish for a total of 20 min at room temperature, swirling gently at the 10 min point to allow the cells equal access to the antibody.\nRinse the PDGFRβ dish three times with D-PBS and pour off the final rinse. Transfer the unbound cells from the CD45 dish to the PDGFRβ dish.\nGently shake the CD45 dish and prop it up at an angle. Gently pipette 1 mL of the cell suspension over the dish to collect unbound cells. Decant it into the PDGFRβ dish and pipette to transfer the remaining cell suspension to the PDGFRβ plate.\nIncubate the PDGFRβ plate for a total of 20 min at room temperature, swirling gently at the 10 min point to allow the cells equal access to the antibody.",
    "Rinse the O4 dish three times with D-PBS and pour off the final rinse. Transfer the unbound cells from the PDGFRβ dish to the O4 dish using the same method as in step 3.2.19. Incubate the O4 plate for a total of 20 min at room temperature, swirling gently at the 10 min point to allow the cells equal access to the antibody.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge for 10 min at 300 x g. Resuspend the cells in the desired volume, and dilute 1:1 with trypan blue for cell viability. Count medium to large cells with a haemocytometer (this will allow for the best representation of the number of neurons in the culture).\nRemove the laminin and plate the cells at the desired density. Do not allow plate to dry between laminin removal and plating, and add the cells immediately.\nCulture the quantified cells for neuronal enrichment (Figure 3) with 500 neurons in 25 µL of culture medium (described in 1.2.7) per well in 24-well plates and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min. Flood the wells to a final volume of 500 µL.\nDay 4: immunocytochemistry (ICC) fixation, blocking, and primary\n\t\nAfter 48 h of growth, add 500 µL/well (or volume equivalent to the media in the well) of 8% PFA for 15 min at room temperature to fix the cells. If media analysis is desired, one may fix with 4% PFA directly. However, we have not tested this.\nWash the cells with D-PBS three times. Note, we have kept these cells in culture without media change for a maximum of 72 h, but hypothesize they could survive longer, particularly if the media is half-changed out.",
    "Remove the final wash and add enough blocking solution per well to cover the cells completely. Block for 30 min at room temperature. Remove the blocking solution and add primary antibody in antibody solution: β3-tubulin at a 1:1,000 dilution. Seal the plate with transparent film and incubate overnight at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: One might consider staining with PDGFRβ for the absence of fibroblasts, CD45 for the absence of immune cells, P0 or PMP22 for the absence of myelin, or fabp7 for satellite glia.\nDay 5: ICC secondary\n\t\nWash the cells with D-PBS three times. Remove the final wash and add secondary antibodies in antibody solution: anti-rabbit 488 at a 1:500 dilution and DAPI at a 1:2,000 dilution. Incubate for 30 min at room temperature, protected from light.\nWash with D-PBS three times. Add enough D-PBS to cover the bottom of the well, and image. The plate can be sealed with transparent film, protected from light, and stored at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
