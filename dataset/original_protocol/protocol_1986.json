    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPerfusion fixation\nTiming: 2.5 h\nMice transcardiac perfusion (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]) and tissues fixation.\nPrepare the NE-1000 programmable single syringe pump. Fill 20 mL of ice cold 0.9% saline in a 60 mL syringe and install the syringe in the syringe pump. Flush the system with 0.9% saline without air bubbles. Adjust pump to a flow rate of 1 mL/min.\nDeeply anesthetize mouse by intraperitoneally injecting 1.5 μL/g body weight of ketamine (0.1 mg/g body weight) and xylazine (0.01 mg/g body weight) mixture. Check the mouse anesthesia by pinching its paw, until it does not twitch.\nTranscardiac perfusion of the mouse to prevent coagulation of the blood.\nStretch out the mouse with the back down on a dissecting pan with needles. Wet the fur with 70% ethanol.\nUse tweezers and operating/dissecting scissors to open the skin and expose the chest cavity.\nCut open the diaphragm.\nGrab at the base of the sternum using tweezers. Cut through the ribcage to expose the heart.\nInsert a 25-gauge winged infusion needle into the left ventricle of the heart. Control the position of the needle without injuring the aorta.\nCut the right atrium immediately to prevent recirculation of the solution.\nPerfuse with 0.9% saline solution until the liver becomes clear (approximately 20 min) at low speed of perfusion (1 mL/min).\nNote: Perfuse the mouse at a low speed. High perfusion pressure will rupture blood vessels and allow blood cells into the surrounding tissues.",
    "Fill a new 60 mL syringe with 60 mL of 4% formaldehyde. Take the infusion needle out of the mouse heart. Remove the infusion tubing from the syringe with 0.9% saline and remove the syringe from pump. Install syringe with 4% formaldehyde in the pump, connect the infusion tubing to the syringe and remove air bubble. Insert needle into left ventricle and perfuse for 60 min (1 mL/min). The animal will twitch and then become stiff.\nExchange the flushing solution to 3% glutaraldehyde and perfuse for another 60 min (1 mL/min). The exchange method is the same as step 4.\nNote: Perfusion fixation allows the access of the fixative to cells in a rapid manner so that cells can be quickly fixed. The fixative hardens tissues and decreases tissue damage and morphological change during subsequent tissue collection.\nNote: Perfusion time depends on the weight of mice. A total perfusion time of 2 h ensures that the largest mice (∼30 g) are adequately fixed.\nCritical: Preserving myelin sheath integrity by appropriate fixation methods is critically important for a successful assessment of the CNS myelination by TEM. Inappropriate fixation of myelin sheath during this step usually results in myelin sheath rupture or damage (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Mouse transcardiac perfusion, related to step 1–3\nTissue dissection and post-fixation\nTiming: 30 min for tissue dissection and overnight for immersion fixation\nDissect the optic nerves, brain or spinal cord immediately as described below and immerse the tissue in 3% glutaraldehyde for fixation overnight at 4°C.\nDissection of spinal cord (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nLay down the mouse with the back facing up on a dissecting pad. Wet the fur with 70% ethanol. Remove dorsal skin from head to tail.",
    "Remove the muscle from the entire spine and expose the vertebrae using fine curved scissors with the blade tips facing up.\nDecapitate the mouse head.\nGently hold the dorsal spine, insert straight supercut scissors laterally at the side of the spine canal and cut both sides of the spine. Pay attention not to damage the spinal cord. Continue cutting in this way along the entire spine, until the whole spinal cord is exposed.\nGently lift the cervical spinal cord, cut the attached dorsal root ganglia on both sides (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1584-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Scale bars: (A and B) 0.5 cm; (C) 1 cm.\nPlace the spinal cord on a Petri dish and cut it into two pieces at the thoracic region.\nPlace the spinal cord in a 20 mL disportable scintillation vial containing ∼ 15 mL of 3% glutaraldehyde for fixation overnight at 4°C in a refrigerator (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nDissection of optic nerves and brain (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nExpose the skull by removing the skin.\nRemove the connective tissue around the eyes to gain access to the eye socket.\nInsert micro dissecting spring scissors carefully into the eye socket behind the eyeball, cut the optic nerve and remove the eye.\nNote: Avoid stretching the nerves by pulling the eyes.\nCut the skull laterally on both sides using a scissor.\nCut the skull from the brainstem to the coronal suture along the sagittal suture. Then cut the coronal suture.\nCut the skull along the lambdoid suture.\nRemove the skull to expose the brain.",
    "Insert forceps in a 45° angle into the forebrain and gently pull the brain out without stretching the optic nerve. The optic nerves should stay attached to the brain (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nRemove the optic nerve by cutting with micro dissecting spring scissors at the optic chiasm (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nPick up the optic nerves gently at the chiasm with forceps and transfer into the same scintillation vial containing 3% glutaraldehyde overnight at 4°C in a refrigerator (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nPlace the brain into the same vial containing 3% glutaraldehyde for fixation for overnight at 4°C in a refrigerator (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nNote: The entire tissue fixation overnight at 4°C in a refrigerator after the perfusion fixation is to fully fix the tissues and make sure tissues will not be damaged when sectioning.\nNote: To separate tissues from different mice, place the optic nerve, brain, and spinal cord from one mouse in one vial for fixation.\nCritical: After fixation, carefully dissect the optic nerve, spinal cord, or brain without bending or distorting the tissues. Mechanic distortion of the fixed spinal cord or brain will likely result in myelin sheath damage, which can be seen in TEM images, particularly at the very high resolution.\nPause point: The tissues can be stored at 4°C in a refrigerator for one week.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2.

Dissection of optic nerves and brain, related to step 7\nTissue slices preparation and trimming\nTiming: 30 min for tissue preparation and overnight for immersion fixation\nPrepare tissue slices using brain or spinal cord matrix and then trim the slices to retain the region of interest.\nCorpus callosum section preparation.",
    "Place the brain dorsal side up in the brain matrix.\nPlace the first blade in the channel, which lies at the true lambda (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A1).\nPlace three more blades in the anterior three consecutive channels. The brain matrix allows slicing of coronal sections through the mouse brain at an interval of 1 mm (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A2).\nNote: Use the double-edge razor blades, which are thinner than the normal single-edge blades, thus minimizing the movement of the brain within the matrix and enabling accurate cutting.\nLift out the three slices between these two blades. Transfer the brain section #2 in Petri dish for the following tissue trimming (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A3). Store the other two sections in 3% glutaraldehyde. Identification of the corpus callosum structure in the coronal sections was based on the annotation from Allen Mouse Brain Atlas (http://mouse.brain-map.org/static/atlas[href=http://mouse.brain-map.org/static/atlas]).\nPerform middle sagittal sectioning of the brain along the midline, divide the brain into left and right sides.\nFor both sides, remove the cortex by cutting the section along the dorsal side of corpus callosum under stereo zoom microscope.\nCut the section again along the ventral side of corpus callosum parallel to the dorsal cutting. The width of the two cuts is approximately 0.5 mm (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A4 and 2A5).\nFlip the corpus callosum to let the wider face lying on the Petri dish using ultrafine point forceps and cut a bevel at the outer edge of the corpus callosum as an embedding mark (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A6).\nTransfer the corpus callosum in a new disposable scintillation vial containing 3% glutaraldehyde on ice.\nCritical: Place the blades close to the edge of the corpus callosum when trimming and just keep the region of interest to make corpus callosum easy to be found under EM imaging. Remove the tissue that is not of interest.",
    "Critical: Slice brains from different mice at the same location to maintain consistency across different mice.\nSeparate the right and left optic nerves using a razor blade and transfer them in the same vial containing 3% glutaraldehyde on ice (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1584-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Transfer the spinal cord slices in 3% glutaraldehyde on ice (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nFix optic nerves, corpus callosum and spinal cord slices from one mouse in a new disposable scintillation vial containing 15 mL of 3% glutaraldehyde at 4°C overnight (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nCritical: Drop 3% glutaraldehyde on the tissues when slicing tissues. Do not let tissues dry during the whole processes.\nTissue embedding in epoxy resin\nTiming: 3 days\nDay 1: Tissue post-fixation, dehydration, and infiltration.\nDecant 3% glutaraldehyde, add cold 0.2 M sodium cacodylate buffer and wash 2 × 10 min in a refrigerator at 4°C. 0.2 M sodium cacodylate buffer is stored at 4°C in a refrigerator.\nCritical: Sodium cacodylate is considered particularly hazardous by ingestion, inhalation, and skin absorption. It may cause disturbances of the blood, kidneys, and nervous system.\nPlace tissues for post-fixation in scintillation vials containing 2% osmium tetroxide for 1–1.5 h at RT in a chemical fume hood. Wrap the vials using aluminum foil to protect the samples away from direct light.\nNote: Osmium tetroxide is light sensitive.\nCritical: Osmium tetroxide is acutely toxic and capable of fixing the mucous membranes of the eyes and nose causing irreversible damage. Skin exposure will result in black dots. It causes long-term toxicity to liver and kidneys.\nPerform 2 × 10 min wash in cold 0.2 M sodium cacodylate buffer in a 4°C refrigerator.\nWash 2 × 5 min in cold distilled H2O.\nDehydrate tissues in increasing concentrations of ethanol:\nQuick wash tissues with 50% ethanol and 2 × 10 min wash in freshly prepared 50% ethanol at 4°C.\nQuick wash tissues with 70% ethanol and 2 × 10 min wash in freshly prepared 70% ethanol at 4°C.\nQuick wash tissues with 90% ethanol and 2 × 10 min wash in freshly prepared 90% ethanol at 4°C.",
    "Quick wash tissues with 100% ethanol and 3 × 20 min wash in 100% ethanol at RT (tissues acclimate to RT).\nNote: Completely dehydrate the tissues, otherwise water remaining in the specimen will not allow epoxy resin to completely infiltrate the specimen and fail to polymerize.\nQuick wash tissues with propylene oxide and then wash 3 × 30 min in propylene oxide at RT.\nOvernight infiltration in freshly made mixture of propylene oxide and embedding resin (1:1) at RT with rotation.\nNote: Agitate gently to prevent samples to attach the vial surface.\nDay 2: Tissue infiltration.\n8 h infiltration in freshly made propylene oxide: embedding resin mix 1:3 at RT with rotation.\nOvernight infiltration in freshly made pure embedding resin at RT with rotation.\nNote: Agitate gently to prevent samples to attach the vial surface.\nDay 3: Tissue embedding and polymerization.\nPlace tissues in appropriate embedding molds with freshly prepared embedding resin. Add printed labels in the mold for identification.\nNote: Write the label for each specimen with a pencil or with a laser printer. Do not use ink as it would be dissolved by reagents.\nCritical: Thoroughly and slowly mix embedding resin ingredients prior to use and eliminate bubble formation. Remove bubbles from the embedding mold or capsules using pipette tips. Bubbles will make cutting difficult and make samples unstable in the electron beam.\nPlace corpus callosum at the bottom of the flat embedding mold with the medial corpus callosum close to the cutting edge of the mold.\nPlace optic nerve at the bottom of the flat embedding mold with the anterior optic nerve close to the cutting edge of the mold.\nPlace the spinal cord segment near the extremities of the embedding capsule.",
    "Critical: Carefully position the tissues to favor the sectioning and experimental purpose when placing them in embedding mold or capsule. During the process of resin polymerization, check and adjust the position of tissues in case of slight movement of tissues using a tapered ultra-fine point tweezers.\nPolymerize the embedding resin block in an oven at 60°C overnight. Block can remain in the oven for a longer period for sufficient hardness. Remove the block from the mold and store in plastic bags at RT. (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E–2G).\nNote: Use the same scintillation vials with caps from step 8 throughout the whole processes of tissue post-fixation, dehydration, and infiltration. Decant the vials and fill up with a new solution.\nCritical: All the reagents and solutions are prepared immediately before use and used one time.\nDo not allow the tissues to dry out during dehydration and embedding.\nPause point: The polymerized embedding resin block can be stored at RT to be sectioned later.\nSemi-thin sectioning and toluidine blue staining\nTiming: 1 h\nTrim the block to 1 mm2 size to accommodate the grid. Next, expose the nerve to make it visible and correct the orientation of the specimen using semi-thin sectioning and toluidine blue staining.\nTrim the cutting surface of polymerized resin blocks down to approximately 1 mm2 size using single edge razor blade.\nNote: Razor blades are easy to be worn out when trimming the hard blocks, so change the razor blades occasionally.\nSemithin sectioning. Appropriately orientate the tissue blocks, make sure the sections (semithin and ultrathin) transect across the longitudinal axonal bundles. For detailed processes, please refer to Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4].\nCut resin blocks to 0.5 μm semithin sections in filtered distilled H2O using Leica EM UC6 ultramicrotome and diamond knife.",
    "Collect and place the semi-thin sections on a slide with water droplets using the eyelash with handle brush.\nPlace the slide on a hotplate stirrer at ∼ 70°C and allow the distilled H2O to evaporate. Circularly move the slide to flatten the sections.\nToluidine blue staining.\nWhen the sections dry out, add drops of toluidine blue staining solution on them and incubate until the edge of the drops begin to dry.\nRemove the slide from the hot plate, rinse under tap water and dry them on the top of hot plate. Mount the slide with a coverslip and Permount mounting medium.\nVisualize the sections using Olympus BX61 upright motorized microscope combined with oil immersion (100×) objective lens. Take microscopic images in bright field.\nNote: The purpose of semithin sections stained by toluidine blue is to observe myelin for further analysis of electron microscopy. Although semithin sections stained by toluidine blue can be technically used to identify the number of myelinated nerve fibers and gross alterations in myelination, ultrathin sections imaged by electron microscopy is required for a more detailed myelination analysis, such as myelin thickness, the process of myelination (ensheathment, wrapping and compaction), axonal degeneration and regeneration, and node of Ranvier.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S4. Ultrathin sectioning, related to step 26\nUltrathin sectioning and post-staining\nTiming: 1.5 h\nCut ultrathin sections using an ultramicrotome and post-staining with uranyl acetate and lead citrate.\nUltrathin sectioning (Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]):\nUse Leica EM UC6 ultramicrotome and diamond knife to cut ultrathin sections in filtered distilled H2O using 0.2 μm syringe filter. The gold color indicates approximate 100 nm of thickness.",
    "Directly collect section on formvar carbon film coated single slot copper grid. Check it under a microscope to make sure the section is in the right area. Allow the sections to dry up on filter paper.\nNote: Formvar carbon film coated grid can stabilize material and make the grid more resistant to the handling during preparation.\nPost-staining using grid staining pad (Methods video S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5]).\nCarefully insert the edge of grid into the grid staining pad (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B). Place the grid staining pad on a piece of parafilm. Drop uranyl acetate solution to fully cover the gird, which forms a solution dome covering the grid. Stain for 20 min away from direct light by covering the grid using a black lid.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1584-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. TEM post-staining using grid staining pad\n(A) Inserting the grids into the grid staining pad.\n(B) Take the grid pad off from the plate holder ready for staining.\nNote: Use of a grid staining pad can increase efficiency and reduce handling processes and potential mechanical damage to grids. Comparable grid staining pad is available for purchase (Electron Microscopy Sciences, # 70901-CB, and 70000-B) (Hiraoka, 1972[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Seifert, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nNote: The uranyl ions combine in large quantities with phosphate groups in nuclei acids as well as phosphate and carboxyl groups on the cell surface including phospholipids and phosphoproteins (Wyffels, 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nCritical: Centrifuge an appropriate volume of 4% aqueous uranyl acetate at 5,000 g for 10 min at 4°C and filter with a 0.22 μm syringe before use. The uranyl acetate crystallizes as needles or rhombi-formed crystals or granular aggregates.\nCritical: Uranyl acetate is sensitive to light and will precipitate if exposed (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B). Store at 4°C in a refrigerator in the dark.",
    "Critical: Uranyl acetate is both radioactive and toxic. It has mild radioactivity that is not sufficient to be harmful while the material remains external to the body. However, uranyl acetate is very toxic if ingested, inhaled or contacted if skin is cut or abraded. Please follow the law regarding how to work with and how to dispose of the radioactive waste material.\nDiscard uranyl acetate solution. Rinse staining pad briefly using distilled water.\nRinse the grid staining pad in three disposable beakers filled with distilled water. Allow the grids to dry.\nCritical: Rinse the grid thoroughly with water, as the uranyl acetate forms crystal precipitate if not removed from the section.\nStain with lead citrate for 1 min. Rinse staining pad briefly using distilled water.\nNote: Lead citrate binds to osmium and uranyl acetate. It is used as enhancer for heavy metal staining in electron microscopy, thereby enhances the contrast of several cellular structures.\nCritical: Filter lead citrate with a 0.22 μm syringe filter before use.\nCritical: Lead citrate precipitates easily in the presence of carbon dioxide (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B). To prevent precipitation of the lead citrate by exposure to CO2, we used lead citrate in syringe and got rid of air bubble to exclude atmospheric CO2. In addition, the water used for preparing the stain or for rinsing should be distilled CO2 free.\nCritical: Quickly transfer grids during preparation, not breathe on grids, which can cause lead-carbonates precipitates formation.\nRinse the grid staining pad in three disposable beakers filled with distilled water.\nDry the grids out using filter paper. Store grids in a grid storage box for EM imaging.\nAlternatives: Post-staining (place grid on drops of stain).",
    "Place a piece of parafilm on a Petri dish and drop uranyl acetate solution on the parafilm. Place the grid on the drop of uranyl acetate solution and incubate for 20 min away from direct light by covering the grid using a black lid. The side with the samples should be facing the staining solution.\nRemove the grid after incubation using forceps and rinse it by dipping the grid for 15s into three 50 mL Falcon tubes containing distilled H2O. Drain off excess distilled H2O by gently touching filter paper to the edge of the grid.\nPlace a piece of parafilm in a new Petri dish and place the grid on the parafilm. Drop 0.3% lead citrate in 0.1 N sodium hydroxide on the grid. Incubate for 1 min keeping the Petri dish covered with lid.\nAfter staining, rinse the grid 4 times for 15 s each using distilled water. Drain off excess distilled H2O and place the grid on a clean filter paper to dry. Store the grid in a grid box for EM imaging.\nPause point: Samples can be stored at room temperature to be imaged later.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S5. Post-staining with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, related to step 27\nTEM imaging\nTiming: 1 h\nUse FEI Talos L120C TEM equipped with CETA 16 MP camera or a TEM with similar configuration to obtain images of ultrathin sections (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B and 4C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1584-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "Mount the grid in a standard TEM holder. Place the specimen facing down inside the specimen carrier. Then insert the holder into the TEM (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nTurn the magnification down to find the stained sheets. Scan the grid at low magnification (×1250) to get an overall image of the myelinated regions. The acceleration voltage is 80 kV.\nThe Stage2 control panel provides functionality for storing positions and tracks (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D). We firstly use the Stage2 control panel to label the outline of the myelinated region of a tissue. Then we randomly acquire 5–30 images per section (5 images for optic nerve and corticospinal tract, 30 images for corpus callosum) at higher magnification. To avoid taking repeated images, we use the Stage2 control panel to mark the stage position of different images.\nRemove the grid from the TEM."
