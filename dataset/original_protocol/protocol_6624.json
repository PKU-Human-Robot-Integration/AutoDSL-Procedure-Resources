    "SidJ in vitro glutamylation reactionReview the flowchart of the experimental outline for SidJ radioactive glutamylation before beginning procedure (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200924/20200924091315_7131.pngFigure 1. Experimental Outline for SidJ Radioactive Glutamylation. A flowchart of general experimental steps described in this procedure beginning with the SidJ radioactive glutamylation assay and concluding with data analysis.Thaw recombinantly purified SidJ 89-853, SdeA 211-1152, and calmodulin on ice. Thaw radioactive glutamic acid stock at room temperature in a radioactive workspace.Note: When working with radioactive materials, ensure that all regulations are followed. Use proper PPE, maximize distance from the sample, and minimize exposure time. Warm water bath to 37 °C and chill centrifuge to 4 °C (if possible).Prepare stock solutions, on ice, listed in Table 1 by diluting in reaction buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl).Table 1. Stock solution concentrations for SidJ in vitro glutamylation reactionimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200924/20200924091337_2128.pngPipette the volumes of stock solution for a single 12.5 μl reaction listed in Table 2 into a chilled 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tube on ice. Move to radioactive workspace before the addition of [U-14C] glutamic acid. Pipette ATP last to initiate the reaction. Immediately vortex reaction gently, centrifuge briefly (approximately 10 s max speed), and incubate samples at 37 °C in a water bath for 30 min.Optional: Prepare a master mix for Step A5. Combine components contained in all reactions by pipetting stock solutions and 3 μl of reaction buffer per reaction. Prepare approximately 10% more reaction mix than needed for samples. The addition of reaction buffer for the master mix dilutes components to maintain protein stability. If a master mix is prepared, for each reaction, subtract the volumes of reaction components included in the mix and 3 μl of reaction buffer from the amount used in Table 2.Table 2.

    "pngNote: For comparison of samples that may have minor differences in activities, the final protein concentration in the reaction of SidJ can be reduced to 50 nM. If studying the impact of calmodulin-binding on SidJ activity, reducing the final molar concentration of calmodulin to the concentration of SidJ may be beneficial. The reaction time can also be shortened to 15 min. Reducing SidJ concentration may make it difficult to accurately compare protein amounts and therefore relative activity using Coomassie staining.Stop the reaction with the addition of 3 μl of SDS sample buffer. Vortex to mix and centrifuge briefly (approximately 10 s at max speed).Gel electrophoresis and preparation for radiation exposureElectrophorese 2.5 μl of protein ladder and 13 μl of each reaction using a SDS-PAGE gel (4% separating gel, 12% resolving gel) at 80 V. Once samples have migrated through stacking gel, increase the voltage to 150 V and electrophorese until the dye front reaches the bottom of the gel. The running buffer will likely be contaminated with radioactive material.Quickly remove the gel from casting glass and remove the stacking gel. Transfer the gel to a plastic container with a lid in secondary containment. Microwave Coomassie stain, enough to cover gel, in a covered microwave-safe container until boiling. Pour heated Coomassie stain into the plastic container with the gel, ensuring not to inhale fumes, and quickly cover container.Stain gel by rocking using rocking shaker for a few hours, to overnight, at room temperature.Note: There was some difficulty visualizing the calmodulin band using Coomassie staining. Staining temperature and time may be decreased if calmodulin can be adequately stained. After staining, discard stain into a radioactive liquid waste container. Rinse with the destaining solution and then incubate in destaining solution for approximately 30 min to 1 h.",
    "Then discard the solution and repeat incubation. Repeat until protein bands are visible. If some background staining persists, allow longer water destaining in Step B5.Rehydrate gel and destain further by incubation in ddH2O while rocking for 1-2 h. Remove water and repeat if necessary. Adding a Kim wipe can assist in destaining and provide cleaner gel images.After the gel is rehydrated, transfer the gel to a sheet protector and image using a gel imager. Wiping dust and staining imperfections with a Kim wipe may help obtain clearer images (Figure 2A)Cut a sheet of filter paper in half with scissors. Gently transfer gel to two stacked layers of filter paper, by touching one side of the gel to the paper, and then smoothly allowing it to lay flat. Avoid bubbles and imperfections. Cover with a layer of plastic wrap and smooth out any imperfections. If there are lines in the plastic wrap, this may impact exposure efficiency.Dry the gel using a vacuum gel dryer at 80 °C for 1 h or until the gel is completely dried. Ensure gel is dried before removing vacuum to prevent gel cracking.While drying the gel, erase the image plate by exposing it on the lightbox for 30 min.Wrap plastic wrap around the filter paper to prevent damage to the image plate. Tape the gel and two filter paper sheets to the bottom side of the exposure cassette. Avoid using thick plastic sheet protectors as they will reduce signal.Place image plate over gel with the white side facing the gel. Record the positioning of the notched edge of the image plate relative to the gel. Expose for 3 to 4 days to obtain optimal signal intensity.Image acquisitionAfter exposure, minimize the ambient light in the imaging room to prevent the alteration of the image signal.",
    "Attach the black magnetic section of the image plate to the phosphor stage and attach the stage to the imager.Open the software and select the phosphorimaging option. Select the following parameters for image acquisition: Laser: 650 nm, Filter: [IP], PMT: 1000, Pixel Size: 25 μM, Latitude: L5, Stage: Phosphor Stage, Mode: All.Click the “Start Scan” button and allow the instrument to scan the image plate. Once, the area containing your gel has been scanned acquisition can be stopped.If a manual selection was chosen, ensure that the area containing the gel was accurately selected. Partial scanning of gels will prevent accurate comparison between portions of the gel scanned separately.A gel file will then be saved in the area chosen upon scanning. This can be saved to a flash drive and transported to a personal computer (Figure 2B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200924/20200924091501_8822.pngFigure 2.

The SdeA E/A is a SdeA E860A mutant of the residue identified to be glutamylated by mass spectrometry. Reactions were conducted for 30 min at 37 °C.
