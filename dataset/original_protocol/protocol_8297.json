    "1. BV-2 Cells Culture\nNOTE: Handle BV-2 cells under Biosafety Level 2 containment. The BV-2 cell line produces an enveloped recombinant ecotropic retrovirus (capable of infecting murine cells only)12; such viruses are known for their in vitro transforming ability and in vivo tumorigenic potential.\nCulture BV-2 cells in high glucose Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin and 2 mM L-Glutamine (referred to as culturing medium from now on) by seeding cells at 4 x 104 cells/mL.\nMaintain cultures in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: the cells grow loosely attached and in suspension.\n2. Label Recombinant Tau Aggregates with pH-sensitive Fluorescent Dye\nNOTE: Tau aggregates were prepared as described in Apetri et al.13 with the difference that no Thioflavin T (ThT) was added to the reaction buffer. Aggregated samples were collected in 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes. Final fluorescence signal was checked by mixing 118 µL of the pool sample with 12 µL of a 50 µM ThT solution. Aggregates were separated by centrifuging the aggregation reaction mixture at 20,000 x g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was analyzed by SEC-MALS to confirm that all the monomeric tau was converted into aggregates. Pellets (tau aggregates) were snap frozen and stored in a freezer at -80 °C.\nResuspend tau aggregates in 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate buffer (NaHCO3) at pH 8.5 to a concentration of 1 mg/mL (~ 20 µM).\n\tNOTE: Concentration of tau aggregates is based on the initial monomers concentration as assessed by the absorption of tau monomers at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 0.31 mLmg-1cm-1.\nSonicate the resuspended aggregates using a probe sonicator while keeping on ice to avoid over-heating.",
    "Use an amplitude of 65% (with sonicator of power 250 W).\nPerform 8 pulses of 3 s with pauses of 15 s between pulses to avoid overheating.\nPrepare an 8.9 mM stock solution of pH-sensitive dye (henceforth reference to as pH dye) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) following manufacturer's instruction.\n\tNote: Always prepare a fresh solution and use it only on the day it is prepared.\nAdd 10 moles of dye per mole of protein to a final dye concentration of 0.2 mM.\nMix by gently pipetting up and down.\nIncubate the reaction mixture for 45–60 min at room temperature, protected from light.\nIn the meantime, assemble a cross-linked dextran gel desalting column following manufacturer's instructions.\nEquilibrate the column with 25 mL of 0.1 M NaHCO3 buffer pH 8.5 containing 3% DMSO. Discard the flow through.\nAdd the product of the tau aggregate labeling reaction to the column in a total volume of 2.5 mL. If the sample is less than 2.5 mL, add buffer until a total volume of 2.5 mL is achieved.\nLet the sample enter the packed gel completely, discard the flow-through.\nElute with 3.5 mL of 0.1 M NaHCO3 buffer pH 8.5 containing 3% DMSO and collect the eluate in 4 equivalent fractions in 2 mL tubes.\nDetermine protein concentrations of the 4 fractions by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay.\nStore the labeled protein in a -20 °C freezer.\n3. Uptake Assay with Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS) Read-out\nDay 1 – Seed the Cells\nWash BV-2 cells in the flask by removing culturing medium and adding 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\n\t\tNOTE: Washing volume will vary based on the size of the cell flask used. For example, for a T175 flask, wash with 10 mL of 1x PBS.",
    "Remove PBS from the flask and detach cells by incubating with trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) 0.05% at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until the cells detach from the flask (approximately 5 min).\n\t\tNOTE: Volume of trypsin-EDTA 0.05% depends on the size of the cell flask used. For example, for a T175 flask, use 2 mL of trypsin-EDTA 0.05%.\nResuspend cells in culturing medium by pipetting up and down three to five times.\n\t\tNote: Volume of culturing medium varies based on the size of the cell flask used and thus total number of cells in the flask. For example, for a T175 flask, use 8 mL of culturing medium.\nCount cells and create a cell suspension with  a final concentration of 1 x 105 cells/mL in culture medium containing 200 μg/mL heparin.\nPlate 250 µL of cell suspension (2.5 x 104 cells) per well in a 96-well tissue culture flat bottom plate.\nIncubate plate overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nDay 1 – Prepare Immunocomplexes\nThaw pH dye-tau on ice.\nPrepare 65 μl per condition of a 500 nM solution of pH dye-tau aggregates in serum-free medium (SFM) (high glucose DMEM supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin and 200 µg/mL of heparin).\nPrepare antibody dilutions in 65 µl of SFM and at a concentration double the final one. Mix pH dye-tau aggregates and antibodies in a 96-well u-bottom plate. Final volume per condition is now 130 µl and the pH dye-tau aggregates concentration is 250 nM. Seal the dilution plate and incubate over night at 37 °C.\nDay 2 – Immunocomplexes Uptake\nRemove culturing medium from BV-2 cells. Wash cells once with 100 µL room temperature 1x PBS.",

Transfer cells to a 96-well U-bottom plate. Centrifuge plate at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nPut the plate on ice, remove culturing medium and wash cells twice by resuspending the cell pellets in 150 µL ice cold 1x PBS. Centrifuge plate at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nPut cells on ice, remove added 1x PBS and wash them by resuspending cells pellets in 150 µL cold FACS buffer (1x PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 2 mM EDTA). Centrifuge plate at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nPut cells on ice, remove added FACS buffer and resuspend cells in 200 µL cold FACS buffer.\nAnalyze samples immediately by FACS acquiring 2 x 104 events in the live cells gate (see step 4.1).\n4. FACS Analysis\nNOTE: Refer to Figure 1 for the gating strategy.\nUsing the forward scatter area (FSC-A) versus side scatter area (SSC-A) density plot, gate on live cells by excluding events with lower forward scatter levels (i.e., debris and dead cells).\nWithin the live cell population, use FSC-A versus forward scatter height (FSC-H) to exclude cell doublets and aggregates. This is the singlet gate.\nUsing the events in the singlet gate, generate a pH dye single parameter histogram.",
