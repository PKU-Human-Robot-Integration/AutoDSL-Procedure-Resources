    "The protocol follows the guidelines of Kwong Wah Hospital's human research ethics committee.\n1. Pre-operative workup\nCheck triphasic CT scans to evaluate the extent of disease and vascular anatomy.\nPerform an indocyanine green (ICG) retention test to assess liver function properly. Preferably, ICG retention of less than 15% is required for patients to undergo major liver resection13.\nPerform CT volumetry to ensure adequate residual liver volume (RLV). 40% RLV is required for cirrhotic liver, while 30% RLV is necessary for the normal liver14.\n2. Anesthesia\nAdminister pre-operative antibiotics, typically 1.2 g of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, intravenously on induction of anesthesia.\nPerform deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis with a sequential compression device and compression stockings15.\nPlace an arterial line and a central venous line.\nControl low central venous pressure to 3-8 mmHg16. An anesthetist performs this.\n3. Patient positioning\nPosition the patient in the Lloyd-Davis position on a split-leg table.\nSet the theatre as depicted in Figure 2, allowing the surgeon to stand between the patient's legs.\n\tNOTE: This position allows the surgeon to operate while standing between the legs, providing ergonomic benefits during such a lengthy procedure and preventing early fatigue.\nElevate the patient to 30Â° left lateral position with a pillow during the operation.\n4. Port site insertion and the laparoscope\nEstablish access into the intraabdominal cavity with a sub-umbilical incision by open Hasson Technique17.\nPlace the remaining ports as depicted in Figure 3.\nPlace a 12 mm port in the right upper quadrant along the midclavicular line.\nPlace 5 mm laparoscopic assistant port at epigastrium, right flank along the anterior axillary line, and left upper quadrant.\n\tNOTE: A laparoscope with a flexible tip is preferred for a better view above the dome of the liver (Figure 4).\n5. Operative steps",
    "Mobilization of the whole right lobe of the liver\n\t\nExpose the root of the right hepatic vein superiorly.\n\t\t\nComplete division of triangular ligament until bare area exposed.\nExpose the groove between the right hepatic veins and the common trunk of the middle and left hepatic veins.\nExpose the root of IVC inferiorly.\n\t\t\nIncise inferior peritoneal attachment and drop the adrenal gland to the retroperitoneum.\nDivide the short hepatic veins and vena cava ligament until the inferior border of the right hepatic vein is seen.\nRight posterior pedicle control with intrahepatic Glissonian approach18.\n\t\nDissect along the superior border of the right posterior Glissonian pedicle along the Rouviere sulcus while keeping the Laennec capsule intact.\nTransect the caudate process to expose the inferior margin of the right posterior Glissonian pedicle.\nDissect along the inferior border of the right posterior Glissonian pedicle along the Rouviere sulcus while keeping the Laennec capsule intact.\nControl the right posterior pedicle temporarily with a bulldog clamp.\nDetermination of the transection plane along the ischaemic line\n\t\nPerform Intraoperative ultrasonography (USG) to identify the course of the right hepatic vein19.\nOpen the liver capsule with an ultrasonic scalpel (Table of Materials) at the dome of the liver along the left margin of the right hepatic vein to secure a correct transection plane.\nMark the rest of the transection line along the ischaemic line with diathermy.\nPringle maneuver\n\t\nPrepare intracorporeal tourniquet for laparoscopic Pringle maneuver by Huang's Loop using a shortened Foley catheter20.\nParenchymal transection\n\t\nOpen the liver capsule with an ultrasonic scalpel along the planned transection line.\nPerform subsequent deep parenchymal transection with the 'ultrasonic scalpel mimic CUSA' technique12.\n\t\t\nKeep both arms of the ultrasonic scalpel open.\nUse the active blade of the ultrasonic scalpel to dissect the tissue.",
    "Activate maximum and move the active blade in a horizontal swinging motion parallel to the vasculobiliary structure.\nDissect the parenchyma while exposing the individual intrahepatic vessels and leaving them intact.\nUse a suction device with the left hand constantly to keep the surgical field dry.\nDivide small vessels with the ultrasonic scalpel.\nDivide large vessels or pedicle structures between plastic clips (Table of Materials) or metal clips.\nRight posterior pedicle transection\n\t\nEncircle the right posterior pedicle with vascular tape.\nTransect the right posterior pedicle with a vascular stapler.\nRight hepatic vein transection\n\t\nTransect the right hepatic vein with a vascular stapler.\nBleeding control\n\t\nThe right posterior pedicle is temporarily controlled as a form of partial Pringle's maneuver during parenchymal transection. Meticulous dissection and identification of intrahepatic vessels are critical. Divide portal and hepatic venules with clips or ultrasonic scalpel.\nUse bipolar diathermy for bleeding with simultaneous suctioning to clear the surgical field.\nIncrease carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum (15-20 mmHg) to slow down the bleeding from hepatic veins and use intracorporal suture for significant bleeding, for example, bleeding from the right hepatic vein.\nUse a suture to secure bleeding from large veins or arteries.\n6. Specimen retrieval\nThe specimen is put into a plastic bag and retrieved through the Pfannenstiel incision.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
