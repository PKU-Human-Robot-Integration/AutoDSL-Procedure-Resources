    "Fertile white Leghorn eggs are obtained from trusted suppliers and incubated according to university-approved guidelines. Chick embryos, stages 18 (day 3) to 24 (day 4) (the stages presented in this paper) are not considered live vertebrate animals by the European Union (EU) directive 2010/63/EU and the institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) guidelines in the US. Chick embryos are considered \"live animals\" after day 19 of incubation according to US laws, but not for the EU. Each egg is labeled with the hatching start date and is scheduled to hatch no later than the 10th day of incubation. After the eggs hatch, the chicks are removed from the incubator. The protocol is performed in two bench-top operation stations (Station 1 and Station 2), focusing on specialized model generation stages.\n1. Preparation before microsurgery\nObtain fertilized eggs either from a vaccine development center with a specific pathogen-free (SPF) grade or through a trusted commercial supplier farm by a fragile delivery courier in dry polystyrene containers. Before incubation, gently clean the eggshell with lint-free wipes soaked in 70% ethanol to remove contamination.\nEmbryo inclusion/exclusion criteria\n\t\nDo not incubate eggs that were cracked or damaged during transport.\nIf bleeding is noted during the LAL procedure or following re-incubation, do not use the embryo.\nDo not use embryos developing in the left side-up position, as hemodynamic blood flow may differ from normal orientation.\nDıscard embryos developing with congenital defects in both pre- and post-surgical procedures.\nInclude embryos that reach the targeted stage developing in their original location, mimicking HLHS as a LAL model.\nIncubate the fertilized white-Leghorn chicken eggs (Gallus gallus domesticus L.), blunt end-up, to the desired stage typically at HH20-2115 (37.5 °C, 60% humidity, 3.5 days) (Figure 1).",
    "NOTE: It is important to keep the eggs at a constant temperature and humidity to increase the yield. Depending on the incubator model, the addition of a pan filled with distilled water will maintain stable humidity. Blueprints of an additional/auxiliary temperature and humidity control system that would fit most incubators are developed by the authors and recommended. The electronics, hardware, and code details of this in-house-built sensor/control unit are provided in a data repository26. Continuous gentle shaking (rotating) of the eggs during incubation may allow optimal positioning of the embryo and thus lead to a higher percentage of \"operable\" embryos. Shaking can also work with incubators with this capacity and increase productivity further.\nBefore starting the procedure, prepare the required number of knots by tying a loose overhand knot into a 1.5 cm long 10-0 suture. Be sure the knot is not tight and is large enough to fit over the atria easily during the operation (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: Tie the knots ahead of time and keep them in a sterile chick ringer solution before using. The knot-tying operation requires the use of two hands to operate the tweezers synchronously. Since this is a critical stage in the protocol, a model of the atrium can be made from putty for practicing this step (Figure 3). This will improve the three-dimensional microsurgery skills needed to perform step 3.2.3 at Station 2 (Figure 4).\n2. Operations at Station 1 (Figure 4A)\nOpen a window from the blunt end of the egg and remove both the outer and inner membranes15 (Figure 5A-D).\nOpen the eggshell by cracking gently with the reverse end of the tweezers, with the free fingers firmly supporting the egg to reduce unwanted crack propagation.",
    "Since LAL is a long procedure, conserve the temperature and humidity of the embryo, as the heart rate depends on the temperature. Thus, ensure the initial shell window is created as small as possible, just enough to execute the operations.\n\tNOTE: No humidity or temperature control systems are employed during the operation, but these systems, if available, would benefit the yield. If possible, the air conditioning system in the lab is shut-down, and the procedure is performed at the highest room temperature (RT) possible. Optimization of the embryonic heart rate, which can be controlled by the temperature, during the operation is also recommended. Some laboratories maintain the heart rate at slightly lower rates than 120 bpm via temperature control during the LAL operation. As such, humidity control employed around the surgical zone would increase the yield further. The eggshell windows are created as small as possible, just big enough to allow surgical access. This is also applicable to the thick outer membrane, which is typically smaller than the eggshell only to the extent of the embryo's circumference. These ensure to maintain the temperature and humidity of the embryo. While opening a window from the blunt end of the egg, the small shell fragments are cleaned so that these pieces do not damage the vitelline vascular integrity or lead to unwanted artifacts. In addition, other laboratories use curved micro-serrated scissors for making windows. Also, two widths of Scotch tape can be used to stabilize the eggshell to control cracking.\nRemove only the necessary vitelline membrane using micro scissors (Supplementary Video 1).",
    "Normal embryonic development is right side-up. Once the embryo is free of the vitelline membrane, place the tweezer with closed tips under the dorsal segment of the embryo and gently flip the embryo to expose the left side (i.e., left side-up configuration) (Figure 6A,B; Supplementary Video 2).\nEnsure that the left atrial bud is now exposed but still covered by a complex membrane system, typically consisting of a double layer of the pericardium.\nRemove the membranes, including the fine ones, immediately around the atrial bud. This is another critical stage; perform membrane removal from coarse membranes and progress to the fine ones around the left atrial bud. Reserve the finest tweezers for removal of the fine membrane (Supplementary Video 3).\nDuring the membrane removal process, orient the embryo in a left side-up position, so that the knot placement operation in step 3.2 can be performed without further repositioning. To achieve this, lift the embryo using the membranes in step 2.6 and hang it from the eggshell, ensuring the left side faces up.",
    "​NOTE: Some embryos can be located close to the eggshell periphery and can be challenging to operate. Still, these embryos will most likely be oriented right side-up and display normal behavior, and can be included in the study. In these cases, if needed, the obscured atrium can be made more accessible by gently cleaning the pericardial membrane with #4 fine tweezers and removing the eggshell in the reverse direction (toward the shell opening). These embryos can also be lifted using parts of the extraembryonic membranes and fixed at the desired position by attaching one end of the membrane (the tweezer end) to the eggshell, using its natural stickiness. Additionally, the space between the head and spinal cord region of the embryo can be expanded with the help of tweezers to reveal the obscured atrium.\n3. Operations at Station 2 (Figure 4B)\nUnder the stereomicroscope, position the pre-prepared knot from step 1.4 close to the embryo at an accessible location (Figure 6B). The atrial bud is now ready to be tied off (Supplementary Video 4).\nRetrieve the pre-prepared open knot and orient it over the left atrial bud. For LAL to work, place the egg in a uniquely inclined three-dimensional orientation.\n\t\nCorrectly orient the knot to execute the tightening process without damaging the embryos.\nClear the fine membranes optimally in step 2.7 to reduce the effect of a beating heart.\nTighten the suture (Figure 6C). For this step, practicing with the putty is very useful. For sham embryos, tighten the knot just enough to hold the knot.\nNext, use the micro scissors to cut the excess ends of the suture as close as possible to the bud (Supplementary Video 5).",
    "Be very careful that the newly cut ends of the tied suture are not in a position to puncture nearby vessels during rotation or due to the heartbeat.\nUsing the tweezers, remove the excess suture pieces cut away in step 3.3.\nFinally, using closed tweezers, return the embryo to its original position, as in step 2.5 (Supplementary Video 6).\nAfter completing the LAL process, cover the egg with a double layer of parafilm and incubate it again. A tight and sterile closing of the eggs is paramount for survival, especially past 24 h of incubation. If visual access is also desired, use paraffin wax with glass slides.\n\tNOTE: As the early embryonic period is studied, the eggs are typically incubated for 24-48 h until they reach approximately HH25 or HH27. However, there is no limit, and later stages can be studied, as attempted by other researchers. For fast operation speeds, at least a two-person team is recommended. One person should be trained for and is responsible for egg opening, initial membrane cleanup, rotation, and membrane cleanup around the left atrial bud. The other person is responsible only for initial knot preparation, knot placement, and tightening. The final embryo rotation can be performed by Person 1. The surgical operation for a single embryo takes about 4-5 min.\nBefore/after surgical operations, clean the bench-top surfaces and instruments with ethanol. Ensure to apply fresh chick ringer solution (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, and NaHCO3)16,27 to the metal instruments touching the embryonic tissues.\nSubscription Required.
