    "Preparation of ribosome-depleted RRL Load 1 mL of RRL into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, place into an 11 mm Delrin tube adapter, and ultracentrifuge at 240,000× g for 2 h 15 min at 4 °C using an Optima MAX-TL ultracentrifuge with a TLA110 rotor.Note: Keep the sample on ice as much as possible in steps 1–2. Handling the sample in a cold room should be an option. Collect 900 μL of the supernatant, transfer to a 1.5 mL DNA LoBind tube, flash freeze with liquid nitrogen, and store at -80 °C. See Video 1 for details on the RRL supernatant collection.Notes: Avoid touching the precipitate that contains the ribosomes. Consider dividing the ribosome-depleted RRL into aliquots in several tubes before the flash freezing to avoid repeated freezethaw cycles. <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Collection of the RRL supernatant Purification of ribosomes from HEK293 cells Seed 5 × 106 HEK293T (naïve or METTL18 KO) cells in 10 mL of DMEM with 10% FBS (see Recipes) into a 10 cm dish and incubate overnight in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Prepare 10 dishes.Note: The cell culture typically reaches 70%–80% confluency. Aspirate the medium from a dish and add 5 mL of ice-cold PBS.Aspirate the PBS immediately and add 1 mL of ice-cold PBS.Repeat steps 2–3 for the other nine dishes.Resuspend cells in the dishes by pipetting, transfer to a 15 mL tube, and centrifuge at 500× g for 3 min at 4 °C, using a refrigerated centrifuge with a swing rotor.Discard the supernatant and add 1 mL of ice-cold PBS.Resuspend cells by pipetting, transfer to a 1.5 mL DNA LoBind tube, and centrifuge at 500× g for 3 min at 4 °C, using a refrigerated centrifuge with a fixed angle rotor.Note: Weigh the 1.",
    "5 mL tube before the cell transfer for the next step. Discard the supernatant and weigh the tube with the cell pellet by the scale.Notes: From this step, handle the sample on ice or at 4 °C. We typically have a ~300 mg cell pellet. Resuspend the cell pellet in the same volume of buffer R (see Recipes) (e.g., 300 μL of buffer R to 300 mg of cell pellet) and incubate for 15 min on ice.Note: Buffer R is a low-stringency buffer. Thus, the isolated ribosome may contain the associated factors. Vortex the mixture for 30 s and centrifuge at 16,000× g for 10 min at 4 °C, using a refrigerated centrifuge with a fixed angle rotor.Collect the supernatant in a 1.5 mL DNA LoBind tube and mix well. Keep 10 μL of the supernatant in another 1.5 mL DNA LoBind tube for Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining.Load 300 μL of the supernatant at the bottom of the 3.2 mL polycarbonate tube and then underlay 1 mL of sucrose cushion solution (see Recipes) slowly using a PIPETMAN P-1000 with a long 1 mL tip. See Video 2 for details on the underlaying of sucrose cushion solution.Notes:  The cell lysate should float on top of the sucrose cushion solution. The interface between the cell lysate and sucrose cushion solution should be clearly visible. If the two solutions are mixed, the ribosome pellet may contain increased contaminants. Instead of PIPETMAN P-1000 with a long 1 mL tip, a cannula or equivalent can be used. <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Laying sucrose cushion solution under the cell lysate Ultracentrifuge the tube at 240,000× g for 2 h 15 min at 4 °C using an Optima MAX-TL with a TLA110 rotor.Note: Mark the outside edge of the 3.",
    "2 mL polycarbonate tube to indicate the side where the ribosome pellet should be located. Discard the supernatant by removing thoroughly with a pipette and slowly add 100 μL of buffer R2 (see Recipes) to the bottom of the tube, avoiding disrupting the pellet.Note: A glassy ribosome pellet should be visible on the outside edge of the tube bottom. Discard the supernatant immediately and add 30 μL of buffer R2.Place the tube on a tube rack, add a stir bar to the tube, and then resuspend the solution at 4 °C for 15 min on the magnetic stirrer. See Video 3 for details.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 3. Resuspension of the pelleted ribosomes with a stir bar and a magnetic stirrer Transfer the solution to a 1.5 mL DNA LoBind tube. Keep 1 μL of the solution in another 1.5 mL DNA LoBind tube for Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining.Note: If the pellet does not dissolve completely, stir additionally for 15 min. Determine the RNA concentration by Qubit RNA BR Assay kit and then determine the ribosome concentration as described below.Prepare 200 μL of Qubit working solution for each standard and sample by diluting Qubit RNA BR reagent 200-fold with Qubit RNA BR buffer, according to the following table below. When you have one sample to test, prepare [2 (standards) + 1 (sample) + 1] × 200 μL solution.table:",

Calibrate with the standards and then read the sample.Select Read Next Sample, followed by Calculate Stock Conc. and then 1 μL to calculate the concentration of RNA in the ribosome solution.Note: We typically have 1,000–2,000 ng/μL RNA in the ribosome solution. Convert the RNA concentration to the ribosome concentration. Given the size of rRNAs (18S rRNA, 1.9 kb; 28S rRNA, 5 kb), the formula (number of nucleotides × 320.5) provides a total rRNA molecular weight of 6.9 × 103 × 320.5 = 2.2 × 106. Thus, the molar concentration should be determined as X [ng/μL]/(2.2 × 106). For example, for a ribosome solution with 1,500 ng/μL RNA, the ribosome concentration should be 1,500 [ng/μL]/(2.2 × 106) = 0.68 μM.Dilute the ribosome solution to 226 nM with buffer R2.Flash freeze the purified ribosome with liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C.Note: Consider dividing the ribosome solution into aliquots in several tubes before the flash freeze to avoid repeated freezethaw cycles. Determine the protein composition in the ribosome solution by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining.Mix the HEK293T cell lysate (from step 11) and ribosome solution (from step 17) with 2× Laemmli sample buffer (see Recipes) in each 1.5 mL DNA LoBind tube according to the table below and denature at 95 °C for 10 min in a dry bath incubator.table:\n﻿Reagent,Cell lysate,Ribosome solution\nSample,10 μL,1 μL\nBuffer R2,,9 μL\n2× Laemmli sample buffer,10 μL,10 μL",
    "Load 20 μL of each sample and 5 μL of BlueStar prestained protein ladder into a precast 5%–20% polyacrylamide gel in 1× SDS-PAGE running buffer (see Recipes) set up in the mini-gel electrophoresis tank. Perform electrophoresis at a constant 20 mA for 70 min at room temperature with a power supply.Fix the gel with 15 mL of gel fixation buffer (see Recipes) for 30 min on a rotary shaker at room temperature and briefly wash the gel twice with Milli-Q water.Stain the gel with 15 mL of GelCode Blue Safe protein stain for 60 min on a rotary shaker and wash the gel with Milli-Q water.Destain the gel with Milli-Q water and paper towels until the background signals are reduced.Note: This typically takes 3 h to overnight. Visualize the gel on an Odyssey CLx imager and Image Studio with 700 nm channels with the focus at 0.5 mm, which corresponds to the center of the 1 mm thick gel.

Representative gel image of Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining for proteins in HEK293T cell lysate (i.e., input) and in prepared ribosome solution. The staining pattern was similar to that in an earlier report (Penzo et al., 2016). We note that due to the low stringency of buffer R, the ribosome solution contained high-molecular-weight ribosome-interacting proteins in addition to ribosomal proteins.Preparation of reporter mRNAs Prepare the PCR mixture in a 0.2 mL PCR tube as described below to amplify the DNA fragments for the template of in vitro transcription of Rluc-Y39×-Fluc and Rluc-Y0×-Fluc RNAs (100 μL reaction).table:\n﻿Reagent,Final concentration,Amount\n1 ng/μL plasmid (psiCHECK2-Y0× or psiCHECK2-Y39×),0.01 ng/μL,1 μL\n5 μM Primer 1,0.2 μM,4 μL\n5 μM Primer 2,0.2 μM,4 μL\nPrimeSTAR Max Premix (2×),1×,50 μL",

See Figure 3 for the representative results for the Rluc-Y39×-Fluc reporter transcript.Calculate the molar concentration of reporter mRNA as described below.i. Take the ng/μL concentration by the result of the MultiNA. For example, since the concentration of Rluc-Y39×-Fluc with poly(A) tail in Figure 3 was 6.0 ng/μL, the stock solution should be 6.0 ng/μL × 10 (dilution factor from the stock) = 60 ng/μL.ii. Estimate the poly(A) length by the result of MultiNA. For example, the poly(A) length of Rluc-Y39×-Fluc with a poly(A) tail in Figure 3 was ~100 nt.iii. Calculate the molecular weight of reporter mRNA. Given that the non-poly(A)-tailed Rluc-Y39×-Fluc should be 2,787 nt, the poly(A)-tailed Rluc-Y39×-Fluc should be ~2,887 nt. Thus, the estimated molecular weight should be 2,887 × 320.5 = 0.93 × 106. For example, the molar concentration of poly(A)-tailed Rluc-Y39×-Fluc reporter in Figure 3 should be 60 [ng/μL]/(0.93 × 106) = 65 nM.Dilute the reporter mRNA to 11 nM with RNase-free water.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4714/bioprotoc-13-13-4714-g002.jpgFigure 2.

    "MultiNA Viewer software automatically assesses the size and concentration of RNA. The poly(A) tail length was estimated to be ~100 nt based on the length difference. Additionally, the RNA concentrations were determined as follows: Rluc-Y39×-Fluc with poly(A) tail, 6.0 ng/μL; Rluc-Y39×-Fluc without poly(A) tail, 23.3 ng/μL. We note that the concentration of individual mRNA measured by MultiNA may be lower than the total RNA concentration predicted by the DS-11 spectrophotometer.Translation reaction Prepare the in vitro translation reaction in a 1.5 mL DNA LoBind tube as described below (120 μL reaction).table:",
