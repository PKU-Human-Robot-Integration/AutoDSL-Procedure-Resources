    "1. Bacterial strains and culture protocols\nStreak colonies of bacteria on agar plates supplemented with appropriate growth media. In this report, B. subtilis (strain 1A1135, Bacillus Genetic Stock Center) is cultured on ATGN (0.079 M KH2PO4, 0.015 M (NH4)2SO4, 0.6 mM MgSO4·7H2O, 0.06 mM CaCl2·2H2O, 0.0071 mM MnSO4·H2O, 0.125 M FeSO4·7H2O, 28 mM glucose, pH: 7 ± 0.2, 15 g/L agar) agar plates supplemented with 100 µg/mL spectinomycin and E. coli (strain 25922, ATCC) on ATGN agar plates supplemented with 100 µg/mL ampicillin.\n\tNOTE: Prior reports of hydrogel encapsulation and release with these materials from Fattahi et al.19 instead used A. tumefaciens C58 cells\nPick desired colonies from ATGN agar plates and start overnight cultures. For E. coli and B. subtilis strains used here, culture at 37 °C while shaking at 215 rpm in ATGN liquid medium for 24 h. Store the cell cultures in 50% glycerol at -80 °C until future use.\nPick colonies of both strains from glycerol stocks using sterile inoculation loops and incubate in ATGN liquid media for 24 h at 37 °C and 215 rpm.\n2. Preparation of the material needed for hydrogel formation\nPhotodegradable PEG-o-NB-diacrylate synthesis\n\tNOTE: The in-house synthesis of the PEG-o-NB-diacrylate has been well-described and previously reported16,17. Alternatively, because the synthesis is routine, it can be outsourced from a chemical synthesis facility.\nCrosslinking buffer\n\t\nTake the recipe of the selected medium for the bacterial strain and prepare media with 2x nutrients. Add phosphate, e.g., NaH2PO4, to the medium to a final concentration of 100 mM. Then, adjust the pH value to 8 using 5 M NaOH (aq).\nSterilize the buffer solution and store it at -20 °C until further use.\n\t\tNOTE: Leave out any transition metals present in the media, as these metals catalyze the oxidation of the thiols to disulfides.",
    "PEG-o-NB-diacrylate solution\n\t\nFor each mg of the aliquot PEG-o-NB-diacrylate (3,400 Da molecular weight) powder, add 3.08 µL of ultrapure water to reach 49 mM concentration of PEG-o-NB-diacrylate (98 mM acrylate concentration).\nVortex the solution until it is well mixed and store this solution at -20 °C until further use.\n4-arm PEG-thiol solution\n\t\nFor 4-arm PEG-thiol (10,000 Da molecular weight) preparation, add 4 µL of ultrapure water per mg powder to reach a 20 mM concentration (80 mM of thiol concentration).\nVortex this solution until it is well-mixed and store this solution at -20 °C until further use.\n3. Preparation of perfluoroalkylated (non-reactive) coverslips\nPlace up to 5 glass slides (25 mm x 75 mm x 1 mm) inside a polypropylene slide mailer. Sonicate the slides with a 2% (w/v) detergent solution (Table of Materials) for 20 min.\nRinse the slides three times with ultrapure water, then sonicate the slides in water for 20 min. Dry the slides using a stream of N2.\nPlasma clean (see Table of Materials) on both sides of the glass slides according to the protocol in section 4.1 for 2 min.\nPlace the plasma cleaned slides back into the slide mailer and fill the container with a 0.5% (v/v) solution of trichloro(1H, 1H, 2H, 2H,-perfluorooctyl)silane in toluene. Allow these glass slides to be functionalized for 3 h at room temperature (RT).\nAfter the slides are functionalized, rinse the slides within the slide mailer, first with toluene and next ethanol (three times with each solvent). Next, dry each functionalized slide with a stream of N2.\n4. Preparation of thiol functionalized (base) coverslips\nCleaning of the glass coverslips using a plasma cleaner",
    "Place 18 mm x 18 mm coverslips in a Petri dish. Then, place the Petri dish in a plasma cleaner chamber and switch on the power of the plasma cleaner.\nTurn the vacuum pump on to clear the air within the chamber until the pressure gauge reads 400 mTorr.\nOpen the metering valve to let air into the chamber until the pressure gauge reaches a steady pressure (800-1000 mTorr). Then, select RF with \"Hi\" mode and expose the coverslips for 3 min.\nAfter 3 min, turn off the RF mode and vacuum pump.\nTake the Petri dish out of the chamber, flip the coverslips, and place them back in the chamber to plasma expose the other side of the glass coverslip.\nRepeat steps 4.1.2-4.1.4 to plasma clean the untreated side of the glass coverslip.\nAfter completing the process, remove the Petri dish from the chamber and turn the plasma cleaner and vacuum pump off.\nCleaning and hydroxylation of the coverslips with piranha solution\n\tNOTE: Standard piranha cleaning protocols can be used to clean and hydroxylate glass slips. Piranha solution is a 30:70 (v/v) mixture of H2O2 and H2SO4. Alternate methods of cleaning glass coverslips may also be used. \n\tCAUTION: Piranha solution is strongly corrosive and explosive with organic solvents and should be handled with extreme caution. Appropriate safety and containment measures should be implemented, such as use of proper personal protective equipment (lab coat, chemical resistant apron, safety glasses, face shield, acid resistant butyl gloves). All glassware and working surfaces in contact with piranha solution should be clean, dry, and free of organic residues prior to use. Piranha solution should never be stored in a partially closed or closed container.",
    "Place a clean 100 mm x 50 mm glass dish on a hotplate magnetic stirrer with adjustable stir speed under a fume hood and add 14 mL of H2SO4 to the dish.\nGently place a small, teflon-coated magnetic stir bar using teflon-coated forceps inside the dish. Then, turn the stirrer slowly to avoid splashing of the acid.\nNext, gently add 6 mL of H2O2 to the dish and allow the solution to become well mixed.\nTurn off the stirrer, then remove the stir bar from the dish using the forceps. Next, gently place the coverslips inside the dish using the forceps and set the temperature to 60–80 °C.\nAfter 30 min, gently remove the coverslips using the forceps and submerge them in deionized water (DI) water two times to wash off residual piranha solution.\nAfter rinsing with water, store the coverslips in DI water at RT until further use.\nTurn off the hotplate and allow the piranha solution to cool.\nTo dispose of the piranha solution, gently place the 100 mm x 50 mm glass dish containing the cooled piranha solution in a larger, empty glass beaker that is at least 1.5 L in volume. Then add 1 L of water to dilute and add sodium bicarbonate powder to neutralize. Note that sodium bicarbonate will cause bubbling and heat generation and should be added very slowly, otherwise bubbling may lead to splashing of the acid. When further addition of sodium bicarbonate does not cause bubbling, check the pH with pH paper to verify that it has been neutralized. Once the solution is neutralized and cooled, it can be poured down the sink.\nThiol functionalization of the coverslips\n\t\nPrepare a 5% (v/v) solution of 269 mM of (3-mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane (MPTS) solution in dry toluene.",
    "Add 10 mL of the solution to individual 50 mL conical centrifuge tubes and place one cleaned coverslip in each tube and submerge it within the solution.\n\t\tNOTE: One coverslip per 50 mL tube is used to assure the thiolation of both sides of the substrate without being disturbed by other substrates.\nAfter 4 h, wash each coverslip (four washes per coverslip) with toluene, a 1:1 (v/v) ethanol: toluene mixture, and ethanol.\n\t\tNOTE: This is done by immersing each coverslip sequentially into conical centrifuge tubes containing the mentioned solutions.\nAfter rinsing the substrate, submerge them in ethanol and store them at 4 °C until further use.\n\t\tNOTE: Depending on the number of coverslips, this method can become laborious due to treating coverslips one at a time. For multiple coverslips, Columbia jars that fit several coverslips at the same time can be used.\n5. Fabrication of silicon microwell arrays\nParylene coating: Use the standard protocol described in previous research articles20,21 to coat silicon wafers with parylene.\nMicrofabrication: Follow the protocol described by Barua et al.18 to design and fabricate the microwell array (Supplementary Figure 1).\n\t​NOTE: Standard photolithographic techniques described by Timm et al.17 were applied to fabricate microwell arrays on parylene-coated silicon wafers.\n6. Hydrogel formation\nBulk hydrogel formation on glass coverslips\n\t\nHydrogel precursor solution: Add 12.5 µL of the crosslinking buffer to an 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, followed by 5.6 µL of PEG-o-NB-diacrylate solution. Lastly, add 6.9 µL of 4-arm PEG-thiol solution to the mixture.\n\t\tNOTE: Adding the 4-arm PEG thiol to the mixture initiates the crosslinking reaction. Thus, the hydrogel precursor solution should be used immediately after mixing.\nFor cell encapsulation in the hydrogel precursor solution, follow steps 6.1.3-6.1.9.",
    "For cell encapsulation, before step 6.1.1, inoculate the crosslinking buffer with the desired cell density. As reported previously19, it was observed that cell density of 7.26 × 107 CFU/mL in the crosslinking buffer correlates to a density of ~ 90 cells/mm2 encapsulated across the hydrogel.\nPlace the thiolated base coverslip on a clean Petri dish. Place two spacers (see Table of Materials) on the two opposing sides of the coverslip.\n\t\tNOTE: Thiol functionalization of the coverslips is necessary for the covalent attachment of the hydrogel to the coverslip surface. This is done through the reaction of thiol groups on the surface and the acrylate groups present in the hydrogel precursor solution.\nFix the spacers on the base coverslip by taping the spacers to the Petri dish.\nPipette the desired volume of the precursor solution on a non-reactive, perfluoroalkylated glass slide.\nPlace the perfluoroalkylated glass slide on the base coverslip (Figure 1C). Wait for 25 min at RT for hydrogel formation to complete.\nAfter gelation, gently remove the perfluoroalkylated glass slide. The hydrogel will stay attached to the base coverslip.\n\t\t​NOTE: For 18 mm x 8 mm coverslips to obtain a 12.7 µm thick membrane, use ~7 µL of the precursor solution (Figure 1A,B). Using higher volumes of precursor solution may result in hydrogel underneath the base coverslip. This may cause the base coverslip to stick to the Petri dish and break upon an attempt of removal. Also, hydrogel residue underneath the coverslip is problematic for microscopy. Gentle removal of the non-reactive perfluoroalkylated glass slide is required as fast removal can damage the hydrogel.",
    "Place the substrate in a 60 mm x 15 mm Petri dish in specified culture media. Here, ATGN media supplemented with 100 µg/mL spectinomycin for B. subtilis or 100 µg/mL ampicillin for E.coli at 37 °C was used for 24 h culture times.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63048/63048fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Hydrogel formation on thiolated glass coverslips. (A) Spacers with a thickness of 12.7 µm are placed on two opposite sides of a base coverslip containing reactive thiol groups. (B) The hydrogel precursor solution is pipetted over a non-reactive, fluorinated glass slide. (C) The non-reactive glass slide is placed on the spacers for the formation of 12.7 µm thick hydrogel. (D) The non-reactive glass slide is gently removed, leaving the hydrogel attached to the base coverslip. (E) The prepared hydrogel can be incubated in media for culture.

Hydrogel formation over microwell arrays\nBacteria seeding in microwell arrays\n\tNOTE: 700 µL of 0.1 OD600 cell suspensions were seeded over the microwell array substrates, and the parylene lift-off method was applied to remove cells from the background using the protocol described by Timm et al.22.\nPrepare the hydrogel precursor solution by adding 5.6 µL of the PEG-o-NB-diacrylate with 12.5 µL of pH 8 phosphate-buffered saline ATGN and mixing with 6.9 µL of the four-arm PEG thiol solution.\nPipette 12.5 µL of the precursor solution on a non-reactive, perfluoroalkylated glass slide and place two 38 µm steel spacers (see Table of Materials) on two opposing sides of the microwell array substrate inoculated with cells.\nInvert the perfluoroalkylated glass slide with the precursor solution droplet and place the droplet in the middle of the microwell substrate. Then, incubate for 25 min at RT for hydrogel formation.",
    "Gently remove the glass slide from the microwell substrate. The hydrogel membrane should remain attached to the microwell substrate. Proceed to step 6.1.9.\n8. Material preparation for cell extraction\nPDMS holder preparation\n\t\nTape a stack of ten 18 x 18 mm coverslips together and glue this stack of coverslips to the bottom of a Petri dish.\nTo fabricate PDMS holders, mix PDMS precursor and curing agent at a ratio of 10:1 volume ratio in a plastic cup, degas the mixture in a vacuum desiccator, and then pour the mixture into the Petri dish.\nCure PDMS for 90 min at 80 °C. Then, cut around the taped block to remove the PDMS holder and place the PDMS holder on a glass slide for easier handling for microscopy.\nMicrosyringe and tubing preparation\n\t\nCut 20 cm of PTFE tubing (0.05 in I.D.) and attach one end of the tubing to a 100 µL microliter syringe.\n\t\tNOTE: For extraction, avoid using pipettes as drawing the released cells via a pipette tip can damage the hydrogel surface and lead to contamination.\n9. Hydrogel degradation with the patterned illumination tool\nNOTE: The following steps described in this section are identical for both bulk hydrogels and microwell arrays, except for the light exposure patterns described in steps 9.6.4-9.6.6 and 9.6.7-9.6.10.\nTurn on the microscope (see Table of Materials). Then, turn on the patterned illumination tool (see Table of Materials).\nTurn on the 365 nm LED light source Analog and Digital control module. Next, turn on the LED light source control module.\nOpen the microscope software and the software for the patterned illumination tool. When the hardware configuration window is opened, select the Load button.\n\tNOTE: Three devices will be loaded here. (Third-party camera, a control module, and the patterned illumination tool)",
    "Press the Start button. The light patterning software window will now open. Select the first option, the Device Control button, on the left sidebar of the window.\nCalibrate the patterned illumination tool.\n\tNOTE: Calibration must be done with the same microscope objective and filter that will be used for light exposure.\n\t\nSet the microscope objective to 10x magnification.\n\t\tNOTE: This magnification allows enough working distance between the microscope lens and the sample surface. It also allows for monitoring and recording the retrieval process in real-time through the image window.\nSet the microscope lens and filter to the settings used for light exposure and place the calibration mirror under the microscope.\nIn the Device Control window, press the LED Control tab. Turn on LED #1 and set the light intensity to the desired number. In standard extraction experiments, this is set to 60%.\nPress the tab titled with the patterned illumination tool product name in the Device Control window. Then, press the Show Grid button.\n\t\tNOTE: A grid pattern will be projected on the calibration mirror.\nAdjust the microscope focus and camera exposure to obtain high image quality of the grid and rotate the camera to align the grid lines parallel to the camera window frame, if needed.\nSelect the Calibration Wizard button under the tab titled with the patterned illumination tool product name and follow the instructions provided by the software in this window.\n\t\tNOTE: A third-party camera setup window will be opened.\nA calibration Type Selection window will be opened. Select Automatic Calibration and press Next.\nWhen the Pre-calibration Adjustment window opens, follow the software instructions, and press the Next button.\nWhen the Mapping Information window opens, save this calibration accordingly in the desired folder. This is done by putting in the date, microscope name, objective lens, and filter.",
    "After calibration, press the Working Area Definition button found under the tab titled with the patterned illumination tool product name to define the working area of the patterned illumination tool if needed.\nSequence Design section for pattern preparation.\n\t\nPress the Sequence Design button on the left-sidebar of the software window. Then, press the Profile Sequence Editor button.\nWhen the Profile Sequence Editor window opens, select the New Profile option under the Profile List.\n\t\tNOTE: Now, a Pattern Editor window will be opened.\nPrepare the desired pattern for light exposure by choosing different pattern shapes and sizes, or manually draw the pattern, if desired.\nFor circle and broken cross patterns for the bulk hydrogel, follow steps 9.6.5- 9.6.6\nFor circle patterns, define a circle with a 30 µm diameter over a target bacteria colony to cover the whole colony. Choose the shape fill color white.\nFor broken cross patterns, choose the rectangle shape from the pattern drawing window with 3 µm x 8 µm dimensions. Place four rectangles with this dimension on the edges of the target colony, while half the patterns have an overlay with the colony.\nFor circle and ring patterns for the microwell arrays, follow steps 9.6.8-9.6.10.\nFor circle patterns, draw a 10 µm diameter circle around the well perimeter. Choose the shape fill color white.\nFor the ring pattern, draw a circle of diameter 20 µm, place it over the well and choose the shape fill color white.\nDraw another circle pattern of diameter 10 µm with fill shape color black and place it around the perimeter of the well.\nEdit the pattern and modify the shapes based on the desired extraction method. Ensure that the desired pattern exists within the working area of the patterned illumination tool.",
    "Place the sample in a PDMS holder and pipette the defined media on top of the sample to prevent sample dehydration and provide a carrier solution for released cells.\nThen, replace this with the calibration mirror.\nAdjust the microscope focus to get a sharp image of the colonies within the hydrogel. Inspect the colonies to identify a colony of interest.\nHere, design the light patterns while the camera view shows the colonies inside the sample to test different patterns for cell extraction.\nSave the defined pattern. After saving the defined pattern, select the Session Control section.\nIn this section, under the tab titled with the patterned illumination tool product name, add the saved sequence.\nAfter adding the sequence, choose the option to simulate the pattern to view and adjust for the desired location of exposure.\n\tNOTE: Sample location can be adjusted here to assure the pattern is projected precisely on the targeted area.\nNext, adjust the light intensity to 60% and the exposure time to 40 s under the LED control tab and start the exposure process.\nMonitor the hydrogel degradation in real-time and brightfield mode to ensure cell release.\n\tNOTE: Prevent any movements to the sample during light exposure as it can cause degradation of unwanted areas of the hydrogel resulting in cross-contamination.\n10. Cell retrieval\nNOTE: Cell retrieval procedure is identical for both bulk hydrogels and microwell arrays.\nAfter 365 nm light exposure and cell release, collect the cells using a microliter syringe and microfluidic tubing (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: Cell retrieval needs to be done immediately after pattern exposure. This allows for localized cell recovery before the released cells move away from the irradiated area.",
    "Change the microscope from brightfield to FITC or TRITC filter to allow for visualizing the exposed area of the sample by the naked eye.\nOnce the exposed area is located, place the end of the tubing upon the irradiated spot. Then change the microscope filter back to brightfield to monitor cell retrieval in real-time.\nUse the syringe attached to the other end of the tubing to carefully withdraw the released cells. Withdraw 200 µL of the solution and insert the solution into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube for DNA analysis or plating.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63048/63048fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Schematic representation of the extraction method for collecting cells released from the hydrogel. Here, immediately after 365 nm UV exposure, hydrogel degradation, and cell release, the microscope is used to illuminate the hydrogel sample with light from a TRITC filter, resulting in a bright green spot covering the area where cell release occurred. This assists the user in identifying the spatial location for sample collection. After visualizing this area, collection tubing attached to a microliter syringe is placed at this spot and the sample is collected. Brightfield microscopy at 10x magnification is used to monitor the end of the tubing and hydrogel surface in real-time for precise cell collection.

Genomic DNA purification and DNA quality measurement\nUse DNA purification kit (see Table of Materials) to extract DNA from bacteria isolates.\n\t\nFollow the manufacturer's specification described in the DNA purification kit handbook23 up to the last step (step 7), requiring elution with Buffer AE.\nFor the elution step, follow the manufacturer's specification, with the difference of using 100 µL of Buffer AE instead of 200 µL.\nRepeat elution once as described in step 11.1.2. This step leads to increased overall DNA yield.",
    "Measure DNA quality by using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nTurn on the spectrophotometer. After the device initialization, on the home page, select the dsDNA option on the screen.\nNext, lift the pedestal arm and clean the pedestal position with DI water and lint-free wipes.\nPipette 2 µL of a blank solution, here AE buffer, on the pedestal position and gently bring the pedestal arm down and select Blank on the screen.\nNext, lift the pedestal and clean the pedestal position with DI water to remove any residual material from the previous measurement.\nLoad the sample (2 µL) on the pedestal position, bring the pedestal arm down, and select the Measure button on the screen.\nRedo steps 11.2.4 and 11.2.5 for all samples.\nOnce the measurement is done, select \"End Experiments\" on the screen. Insert the flash drive into the device and press \"Export data\" on the screen.\n12. Determining cell viability from hydrogel and microwell extracts\nDilute the bacterial suspensions by a dilution factor of 105 using a 96-well plate.\nPipette 10 µL of the diluted bacterial suspension and spot three times on ATGN plates for each bacteria suspension.\nTilt the plates to spread the cells on agar surfaces. Air-dry the ATGN plates containing the bacterial suspensions.\nIncubate the plates at 37 °C for 48 h. Count and record the Colony Formation Units (CFUs) numbers. Count all three spreads of bacterial suspensions on each plate.\n\tNOTE: Perform steps 12.1-12.4 in a biological safety cabinet to avoid contamination of the plate."
