    "1. Extract Preparation\nStreak yeast strains from frozen stocks for single colonies on YPD plates (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose, and 2% agar). Incubate the plates at 30 °C for 2 days.\nInoculate yeast from a YPD plate (use a single colony) into 15 mL of YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) in a 50 mL conical centrifuge tube and grow overnight with shaking (200-250 rpm) at 30 °C.\nDilute culture into 500 mL of YPD medium in a 2 L sterile flask, so that the OD600 < 0.1. Grow yeast cells with shaking at 30 °C for 3-5 h until OD600 = 0.5 (mid-log phase).\nCollect cells by filtering through 0.45 μm membrane filters using a glass holder filter assembly. Scrape the pellet with a spatula, flash freeze in liquid nitrogen, and store at -80 °C. The expected size of the frozen pellet is ~ 0.2 - 0.5 g.\n\tCaution: Liquid nitrogen is extremely low temperature; wear appropriate protection.\nPrepare a fresh Lysis Buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 140 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 100 μg/mL cycloheximide, 0.5 mM DTT, 1% Triton X-100) immediately prior to use, keep on ice.\nPut 3 chrome-steel beads (3.2 mm) into a 1.8 mL stainless steel tube. Pre-chill in liquid nitrogen and add frozen pellets, cover with a silicone rubber cap. Homogenize the sample by cryogrinding for 10 s at 4200 rpm; repeat 10 times. Chill the tube in liquid nitrogen for at least 10 s between each round.\n\tNOTE: It is important to always keep the sample frozen.\nAdd 1 mL of Lysis Buffer, mix well by pipetting.

    "Before sending the samples for sequencing, determine the yield and quality of PCR-amplified libraries. Representative profiles for footprint and mRNA sequencing libraries are shown in Figure 7. The expected size of the PCR-amplified library is 148-152 bp for Footprint samples, and 170-190 bp for mRNA samples.\nIf several samples with different barcodes will be pooled for sequencing, perform accurate quantification of the libraries using a qPCR-based sequencing library quantification assay.\nPool the libraries in equimolar ratios. Calculate the total volume of the pool as 3 µL x total number of samples to be pooled. Determine the volume of each library that needs to be added so that libraries are mixed in the equimolar ratios to achieve 10 nM final concentration of the pool. Add the calculated volumes of each library into a new 1.5 mL tube, mix by pipetting. Add water to achieve the calculated total volume. Store pooled libraries at -20 °C.\nSend an aliquot of the pooled library to be sequenced using 50 bp single-end sequencing run on an Illumina sequencing platform. We routinely multiplex 12 samples in a single sequencing run, which yields ~ 200 million reads per sequencing lane.\n\tNOTE: The final number of footprint reads collected per each sample depends on the quantity of the input material and the level of rRNA contamination.\nSubscription Required.
