    "The animal work presented here was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs) of the University of Houston and Indiana University.\n1. Fish husbandry\nNOTE: Work with vertebrate models requires an IACUC approved protocol. It should be conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines.\nMaintain adult zebrafish as described in previously published literature9.\nIn the afternoon, place adult zebrafish in breeding tanks. Breed males to females at a ratio of 1:2.\n2. Preparation of solutions\nMake a stock solution of 1% low melt agarose in embryo media (E3: 5 mM NaCl, 0.17 mM KCl, 0.33 mM CaCl2, 0.33 mM MgSO4, adjusted to pH 7.0). Aliquot the stock solution into 1.5 mL tubes and store them at 4 °C.\nMake a stock solution of 4% (w/v) Tricaine (MS-222) in distilled water. Store at 4 °C in a dark bottle.\n\tCAUTION: Tricaine is toxic and should be weighed and dissolved in a fume hood.\nMake a stock solution of 20 mM N-phenylthiourea (PTU) in distilled water. Store at -20 °C.\n3. Preparation of embryos\nAfter mating, harvest embryos in E3 in a Petri dish and incubate them at 26.5 °C for about 28 h before mounting.\n\tNOTE: This slows down the development of the embryos so that the embryos are approximately at 30 somite stage at the beginning of imaging.\nAnesthetize embryos in 0.016-0.020% Tricaine in E3. To inhibit pigmentation, add PTU to a concentration of 200 µM.\nDechorionate the embryos using forceps under a dissecting microscope. Using two forceps, grip and gently pull the chorion apart to release the embryo.\n4. Mounting in agarose",
    "NOTE: The developed mounting method requires two different concentrations of low-melt agarose in E3 with 0.02% Tricaine and PTU as needed. The first agarose solution contains an optimal concentration of agarose at which the distortion and motility are at a minimum. The optimization is described in step 5 below.\nHeat the agarose solutions for the two layers (concentration defined in step 5 below and 1%) to 65 °C. Let the agarose cool down to approximately 30 °C just before mounting so that the embryo is not harmed by the heat. For mounting, use 35 mm glass bottom dishes with a No. 0 cover glass bottom. The cover glass attached to the bottom of the dish creates a 10 mm shallow (approx. 1.2 mm deep) well, in which the embryo is to be placed.\n\tNOTE: In this case, the concentration with the least motility and distortions were between 0.025 to 0.040% agarose.\nGently place a dechorionated embryo with one of its lateral sides toward the bottom of the dish using a glass pipette or micropipette. If using a micropipette, cut the outer part of the tip to increase the size of the opening to fit the embryo (Figure 1A). Carefully remove any remaining E3 with a micropipette.\nAdd the first agarose solution to the small well created by the cover glass attached to the bottom of the dish to cover the embryo (Layer 1) (Figure 1B). Ensure that the agarose covers the small well but will not overflow it.\nCover the small well with a cover glass (22 mm x 22 mm) (Figure 1C) to create a narrow agarose filled space with the embryo between the two cover glasses.",
    "Place a layer of 1% agarose solution on top of the cover glass all over the bottom of the dish (Layer 2) (Figure 1D). As this layer solidifies, it holds the cover glass in place.\nFill the remaining portion of the dish with E3 containing 0.02% Tricaine to keep the system hydrated (Layer 3) (Figure 1E).\n\tNOTE: In this setup, the cover glass and 1% agarose protect the bottom layer from getting diluted.\n5. Optimization of agarose solution for layer 1\nTo identify the optimal concentration of agarose for Layer 1, use a multiscale grid search approach. Mount embryos in increasing concentrations of agarose ranging from 0.01% to 1% followed by time-lapse imaging of embryo growth restriction and motility in the field of view. Identify the concentrations where both the distortion and motility are at a minimum.\nTo optimize the concentration of agarose further, mount the embryos using a finer range of concentrations of agarose (e.g., between 0.025 and 0.040% agarose) depending on the concentration found to be best in step 5.1 (e.g., 0.025%, 0.028%, 0.031%, etc.).\n\tNOTE: In our laboratory, the optimal agarose concentration was around 0.03%.\n6. Time-lapse imaging\nNOTE: This mounting method works for any inverted microscope with time-lapse functionality for fluorescence and bright field imaging.\nPerform time-lapse imaging for the whole embryo or parts of it for up to 55 h. For imaging of several embryos, use a stage adaptor that holds several dishes with one embryo mounted per dish. Rotate the dishes one by one so that the embryos are approximately horizontally positioned as determined by eye. For optimal embryo growth and development, use a microscope stage with an incubator set at 28.5 °C.",
    "Select a low magnification objective in the microscope software. Under the eye piece, locate and finely align the embryos horizontally by rotating the dishes using bright field illumination and record their locations in the software. Create a filename for automatic saving of the data.\n\tNOTE: In this experiment, a plan apo λ 4x 0.2 NA objective and the XY tab within the ND acquisition window were used to record the locations of the embryos. Data were saved in .nd2 format. The objective was selected by clicking on its icons in the Ti Pad tab.\nSet the pinhole size, scan speed, image size, and zoom. Next, select a higher magnification objective for capturing the images.\n\tNOTE: In this experiment, a plan-apo 10x 0.45 NA objective was used for imaging of whole embryos, and a super-fluor 20x 0.75 NA objective was used for the higher magnification imaging of parts of the embryo. The pinhole was set to 1.2 AU (19.2 µm for the 10x lens), the scan speed was set for a pixel dwell time of 2.4 µs and the image size was set to 1024 x 1024 pixels with a scan zoom of one, giving a pixel size of 1.24 µm for the 10x lens and 0.62 µm for the 20x lens.\nSelect the channels for the fluorescence to be imaged. Adjust the image capture settings one channel at a time. For each fluorescence channel adjust the laser power and the detector high voltage, making sure to collect the best dynamic range possible while avoiding the saturation and limiting photobleaching.",
    "NOTE: In this experiment, GFP was imaged with the 488 green channel, (488 nm laser and emission between 500 and 550 nm), and RFP with the 561 red channel (561 nm laser and emission between 570 and 600 nm), and the transmission image was collected using the 561 nm laser and the transmitted light detector (TD channel).\nTo image the whole embryo with the 10x objective, image several fields of view with overlap and stitch them together using the microscope software.\n\tNOTE: As the embryos will grow substantially in size during the imaging, make sure that there is space in the field of view anterior and posterior to the embryo. Use the Scan Large Image tab of the ND acquisition window and select a 4 x 1 pattern with 10% overlap to capture four adjacent fields of view.\nConfigure the settings for capturing the Z-stacks using the microscope software.\n\tNOTE: Because the embryo is mounted close to the bottom of the glass dish, its center will move away from the bottom as it grows. Use the Z tab of the ND acquisition window and select the Asymmetrical relative range. With this method, the current focus plane is used as the Reference plane and the rest of the planes are asymmetrically distributed above and below to include the whole embryo within the Z-stack volume, with enough space to account for the specimen's growth. In all experiments, the interval was set to 11 µm and the total range to about 45 planes.\nIn order to maintain the focus of multiple embryos during long-term time-lapse imaging, use an automated focus. If imaging several embryos, adjust the individual offset levels for each embryo to focus at the Reference plane.\n\tNOTE: In this experiment, a laser-based focus stabilization system was used.",
    "Set up time-lapse parameters in the microscope software and image for a duration of 55 h at about 1 h intervals. At each cycle, capture two embryo datasets sequentially and save data automatically after each cycle.\nProcess images using an on-line or off-line version of the microscope software. If more than one embryo was imaged, create independent files for each embryo by splitting the dataset based on the location of imaging. Use maximum intensity projections or a similar tool to convert 3D time data sets into 2D time data sets. Create movie files by using the Save as menu option, selecting .avi as the file format. Select the No compression option with 200 ms intervals for a playback speed of 5 frames /s.\n\tNOTE: The original dataset of two embryos in this experiment was split using the Split locations function in the software (File | Import/Export | Split Multipoints). 3D time datasets were converted to 2D time data sets using the Maximum intensity projection function (Image | ND Processing| Create Maximum Intensity Projection Image in Z).\nSubscription Required.
