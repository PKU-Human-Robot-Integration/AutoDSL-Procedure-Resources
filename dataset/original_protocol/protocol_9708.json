    "The protocol in this study was approved by the UK National Health Service Health Research Authority North East-Tyne & Wear South Research Ethics Committee with the reference number 18/NE/0318 on 6 February 2019 and was adopted by the Institutional Review Board of each participating center. The study was conducted within the principles of Good Clinical Practice and following the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study. The patient information is kept anonymous.\n1. Workflow for ultrasound M-mode or Apical view DICOM image analysis and LV parameter extraction\nNOTE: To begin this protocol, the user must log in to the SILICOFCM platform8 and choose the appropriate workflow (i.e., ultrasound image analysis using M-mode or Apical view). The workflow for ultrasound M-mode DICOM image analysis and LV parameter extraction, for example, involves several steps. The first step is template matching. Templates to be matched include all the relevant necessary borders. It should be emphasized that, for every new dataset, the template should be extracted manually just once for each dataset that corresponds to a specific ultrasound machine. The workflow diagram is presented in Figure 1. The area matching the template will be extracted from the analyzed image after Felsenszwalb's efficient graph-based image segmentation algorithm finds \"strong\" boundaries that correspond to the borders of the septum and the wall of the LV. Based on these borders and the places where the heart diameters are the largest (corresponds to diameter in diastole) and the smallest (corresponds to diameter in systole), various LV dimensions will be calculated. The user should define whether the view is M-mode or Apical view.\nLog in to the platform with a username and password. Under Virtual Population Module, choose ultrasound M-mode or Apical view workflow.",
    "In the list of available workflows, select the ultrasound-merged workflow.\nIn the File Upload section, upload images and DICOM files stored locally on the user's computer (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: Inputs to the module M-mode view DICOM image analysis from a specific patient and LV parameter extraction are the testing image (provided by the user in DICOM format representing M-mode or Apical view) and static files (Figure 1). The static files comprise a) the input.txt file, which is a template file used to overwrite the calculated output measures from the module (new output files are created, in turn, from this file), and b) the template image file, which is used for template matching (i.e., template_dicom_GEMS.jpg).\nSelect either Private or Public folders as the Destination Folder for the files. Type the desired comment or note in the Comments section before starting the workflow. Select the Apical view and M-mode LV ultrasound images and DICOM files uploaded previously (Step 1.3.) (Figure 3).\n\tNOTE: Ultrasound Heart Segmentation tool consists of two sub-modules: the apical view and the M-mode view. Both modules are accessed via the platform. The analysis includes the calculation of the characteristic parameters visible in corresponding cross-sections. In both cases, the necessary values are written to a file that is taken as input to the parametric heart model from the user side (see the discussion for details).\nClick on the Execute button. The interactive platform notifies the user when the running workflow is finished.\nVisualize the created geometry of LV directly on the platform (a 3D model will appear automatically on the screen, which can be rotated using the mouse). Available options include Shaded and Wireframe models for visualization.",
    "â€‹NOTE: After the LV dimensions are extracted, based on mesh options, the mesh of finite elements is generated, and finite element analysis simulation is run with user-prescribed inlet and outlet velocities (see below).\n2. PAK finite element solver for fluid-structure (FS) simulations\nNOTE: This tool can be used for the finite element analysis of the coupled solid-fluid problems. It supports both strong and loose coupling between solid and fluid. Elements can be hexahedrons or tetrahedrons, with or without an additional node at the center of the element. This solver has built-in material models such as the Holzapfel model, hunter muscle model, etc. The PAK-FS information flow diagram is depicted in Figure 4. It starts from the input file and PAK preprocessor. The PAK preprocessor tool outputs a DAT file, which will serve as an input file for the finite element solver. The final output from the solver is VTK files that include the results of the finite element simulation: velocities, pressures, strains, and stresses in the left ventricle.\nDownload the template files for the boundary conditions of inlet and outlet velocities using the buttons in the bottom section (Figure 3); if patient-specific flow boundary conditions are available, download and use these files. Download the mesh options by clicking on the corresponding button in the bottom section. Save these files into either Private or Public folders.\nUpload these files in a similar way as uploading images (Figure 3). The prescribed inlet and outlet velocities simulate the drug condition, while the mesh options control the density of the finite element mesh. For simulating patient-specific conditions, modify the default values of pressure, flow, material properties, and calcium function.",
    "Click on the Execute button. A new running workflow will appear in the list. If any of the sections of the workflow are not clear, click on the Help File button (Figure 3) to view detailed instructions on how to use this workflow, as well as to interpret the results.\n\tNOTE: If everything executes without errors, the status of the workflow will change from \"running\" to \"finished ok\".\nView the results with several options. Alternatively, download the results; the results folder contains VTK files, CSV files, and animations.\n\t\nClick on the eye button to view ejection fraction and global work efficiency values, as well as diagrams of pressure vs. volume, pressure vs. strain, and myocardial work vs. time.\nClick on the camera button to preview and play animations of the displacement, pressure, shear stresses, and velocity fields.\nClick on the 3D visualization button to visualize the outputs online in ParaView Glance.\n\t\t\nLoad multiple VTK files previously downloaded as results. See several parameters of interest and change the field, for instance, to velocity for visualization.\nRotate the model or change the color scheme. Choose Surface with edges or Wireframe for the representation of the surface. Apply the same methodology to every loaded VTK file.\n3. Determination of ventricular activation sequence from ECG measurement",
    "NOTE: A modified FitzHugh-Nagumo model of the cardiac cell was implemented. The precordial leads were modeled with the standard six electrodes. The potential of the heart was optimized with inverse ECG. Starting from activation in the sinoatrial node (which is a function of time), with heterogeneous action potential through the heart and torso, the user can get electrical activity on the total torso model. The PAK-TORSO information flow diagram is given in Figure 5. The user provides scaling of the torso model in all directions (x,y,z) and ECG signal function. Then the scaled model is created, and its behavior is simulated using the PAK-FS solver. The user provides these input values in a text file. The output of the simulation is a VTK file with the electrical activity of the heart in the torso-embedded environment.\nOn the homepage, go to Execute Workflow and then choose torse-cwl in the list of available workflows. Add a comment or note in the Comments section before executing the workflow.\nClick on the Input Template File button and save the content shown on the webpage as input.txt file, which will be used for the torso model. In the Input File field, select the downloaded input.txt file. After the file is imported, click on the Execute button to start the calculation.\n\tNOTE: A new workflow will appear in the bottom left, with its status shown as \"running\"; the calculation lasts about 0.5 h, and then the status will change to \"finished ok\".\nClick on the eye or camera buttons in the bottom left corner to visualize the available simulation reports or animations directly on the platform.",
    "NOTE: The results include distributions of the electrical field, velocity, pressure, shear stress, and deformation at each time step. Animations for each of these distributions are possible to view for the total heart cycle.\nAlternatively, click on the 3D visualization button to visualize the outputs online in ParaView Glance.\n\t\nSelect the OPEN A FILE button, go to the GIRDER tab, enter user credentials if prompted, and open the Private folder.\nOn the next page, select the workflow-outputs folder, and open the torso-cwl folder. Open the first folder on the list.\nSee the list of VTK files that represent the simulation results. Choose one or more files and click on the SELECT button to load the file in ParaView Glance.\nManipulate the model geometry (i.e., move, rotate, zoom in or out, etc.) using the mouse.\nSelect different options for model representation as follows.\n\t\t\nChoose the Wireframe option to see the interior of the torso with a heart incorporated within the torso. Choose the Points option to display a dotted representation of the torso model with full heart mesh.\nAdjust the Point Size value to change the display results. Adjust the Opacity value to see the interior of the torso and display results inside the heart mesh.\nClick on the Color By drop-down menu and choose the desired option, for instance, electric potential. Change the default color scale to any of the listed options.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
