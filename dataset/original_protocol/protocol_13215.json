    "All patient data used for evaluating the RPA were used retrospectively, with approval from The University of Texas MD Anderson Institutional Review Board. The RPA comprises a series of dashboards located to the left of the main menu of the RPA webpage (Figure 2). Figure 2 shows the main dashboard. All dashboards have a similar look but focus on different tasks and personnel. The following protocol describes the key processes for the automatic creation of a treatment plan.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65504/65504fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Screenshot of the RPA main dashboard.

Complete Service Request\nTo create and accept a new Service Request for automatic planning:\n\t\nGo to the Service Request dashboard by clicking on the Service Request channel.\nClick on New Form to generate a new Service Request form.\nIn Section 1: Demographics, complete the questions. Select the treatment technique from the Treatment pulldown. Click on the individual imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65504/65504eq01.jpg in the treatment technique pulldown to access further details of the treatment technique.\nIn Section 2: Treatment-General Questions, complete the questions. These questions are the same for all patients; their purpose is to actively engage the user in determining whether the RPA Plan is appropriate for the current patient.\nSection 3: Treatment-Specific Questions, complete the questions for the selected treatment approach, including details of the treatment targets and prescription.\nClick on submit. Once the Service Request PDF has been automatically generated, select the patient in the patient list (on the Service Request dashboard). Review the Service Request PDF (Figure 3), scrolling if necessary, and click on Accept to approve the Service Request.",
    "NOTE: This PDF must be accepted by a radiation oncologist before the RPA will initiate automated contouring and planning.

    "Review the uploaded CT scan by selecting the patient in the patient list to open the CT viewer for this patient (Figure 4), and then use the following controls:\n\t\nLoad the entire 3D CT image set by clicking on Load CT.\n\t\tNOTE: Other navigation tools are not active until this is complete.\nScroll between slices in all views, and use any of the following tools:\n\t\t\nClick on <, > buttons below each CT view to move to the next slice.\nClick on <<, >> buttons below each CT view to move five slices in the selected direction.\nMouse scroll wheel: Move the cursor over any CT view and then use the mouse scroll wheel to scroll between slices.\nClick the Intersect button to overlay a crosshair on each CT view (axial, coronal, and sagittal). Click on any of the three views to move the crosshair to this point-the other views will follow accordingly. Click the Intersect button to turn this tool on/off.\nClick the Zoom/Pan button. Further review the image using the mouse wheel to zoom the view where the cursor is positioned or right-click and hold down on a CT view and then move the mouse to pan.\nClick on Marked Iso to move the CT views to the marked isocenter (based on automated detection of three radiopaque markers).\n\t\t\tNOTE: This button is inactive if the 3D CT image set has not been loaded (click Load 3D to resolve this) or if the RPA was unable to detect a marked isocenter (as identified with a three-point setup).\nClick on the Ref Point button to add a reference point.\n\t\nMove the three views to the desired Reference Point location using the intersect tool.\nClick on the Ref Point button to add a Reference Point.",
    "If a Reference Point has already been selected, clicking on Ref Point will move the three views to this point.\n\t\tNOTE: This button adds a Reference Point to an image if a Reference Point does not exist. It can also move the CT image views to the Reference Point if one already exists. A new Reference Point can only be selected for CT scans that have not been accepted. Below are the steps to add a Reference Point:\nTo select a new Reference Point, first clear the current Reference Point by clicking on Clear Ref Point and then add a new one. The RPA only Accepts one Reference Point.\nAccept the CT scan. After reviewing the patient's CT scan as already described above, perform the following steps:\n\t\nAnswer the questions below the CT images to minimize risk and reduce the occurrence of errors in the subsequent RPA calculations.\nSelect Accept and follow the prompts.\n\t\t​NOTE: This task can be performed by anybody identified as a Clinical User of the RPA.

Importing the RPA Plan into the User's treatment planning system and reviewing for clinical use\nNOTE: Once the RPA plan is downloaded (DICOM files), the following steps should be completed in the user's treatment planning system:\nImport the patient's CT scan into the local TPS. This is the original scan that was uploaded to the RPA.\nImport the RPA Plan and RPA contours into the local TPS.\nRecalculate the dose using the local commissioned dose calculation algorithm and the used fixed MU option.\nCompare the imported contours and calculated dose with those in the RPA Report (to check for correct import).\nReview the plan for appropriateness and edit as necessary.\n\t​NOTE: This step may include editing field shapes and renormalizing the fields.
