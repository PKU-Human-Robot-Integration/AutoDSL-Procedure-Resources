    "All experiments using human neuroendocrine tumor samples have been approved by the University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics IRB committee (Protocol number 199911057). A list of all materials and equipment is described in the Table of Materials. A list of growth media and key solutions is found in Table 1.\n1. Small bowel neuroendocrine tumor (SBNET) collection and cell dissociation\nObtain resected patient SBNET samples after tumor tissues confirmation from the Surgical Pathology Core.\nCut SBNETs into 5 mm cubes and store in 25 mL of DMEM/F12 medium in a conical tube for the transportation to the laboratory.\nTransfer the tumors in DMEM containing 1% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Pen/Strep), 1% glutamine (Wash Medium) and incubate in this Wash Medium for 15 min.\nTransfer tumors to a new dish and mince tumors to less than 1 mm pieces using sterile curved scissors.\nTransfer the minced tissues to a new 50 mL tube containing 25 mL of Wash Medium.\nCentrifuge the sample at 500 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellets in 10 mL of Wash Medium containing collagenase (100 U/mL) and DNase (0.1 mg/mL).\nAllow the digestion of the minced tumors to occur in a 37 °C incubator with slow shaking (50 rpm) for 1.5 h.\n2. Culture of SBNETs as tumor spheroids in ECM\nAfter digestion is completed (step 1.8), centrifuge at 500 x g for 15 min at 4 °C, discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 15 mL of Wash Medium.",
    "Place a 70 µm cell strainer on top of a new 50 mL tube and transfer 10 mL of the Wash Medium over the cell strainer. Swirl the Wash Medium to cover the side of the plastic tube to prevent NET cells from sticking to the side of the plastic tube.\nFilter the cell suspension through cell strainer.\nCentrifuge at 500 x g for 15 min at 4 °C, discard the supernatant, resuspend the pellet in 200 µL of Wash Medium (total volume is ~ 250 µL) and place it on ice.\nTransfer 5 µL of cells to 500 µL of Wash Medium (1/100 dilution factor). Use the diluted cells for cell counting using a hemocytometer to obtain the number of cells per milliliter. Multiply by 100 to correct for the dilution factor.\nMultiply the number of cells per mL obtained in step 2.5 by the total volume of cells in suspension obtained in step 2.4 (~ 250 µL).\nCentrifuge at 500 x g for 15 min at 4 °C, discard the supernatant, and resuspend the cells in liquid ECM (1 x 106 cells/mL) and keep on ice.\nTransfer 5-20 µL of SBNET spheroids in ECM to a 96-well plate and allow the liquid ECM to solidify by placing the plate in a 37 °C incubator for 5 min.\nAdd 200 µL of SBNET culture medium (DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1% PEN/STREP + 1% Glutamine + 10 mM nicotinamide + 10 µg/mL insulin) to each well of the 96-well plate containing the SBNET spheroids in ECM.\nAlternatively, culture SBNET organoids in stem cell media similar to what has previously been described for growing either human liver or pancreatic organoids9 and listed in the Table of Materials.\nChange media every 5-7 days.\n3. Quantification of SBNET spheroid size using ImageJ",
    "Take 5-10 pictures of SBNET spheroids at Day 1, 4, 7, 14, 23 and 97 of the culture using a 10x objective.\nOpen saved images in ImageJ. Go to the Analyze tab, select the Set Measurements option and place a check on the Area option.\nUse the oval selection tool from the tool bar to generate an ellipsoid or circle around a well-focused spheroid.\nGo to the Analyze tab and select the Measure option. Repeat steps 3.4 and 3.5 in order to get area measurement from 25-50 SBNET spheroids. The values are provided in pixel square.\nConvert the pixel area to µm2 by dividing the size of each pixel with the length of each pixel to µm conversion factor of the microscopy images.\n\tNOTE: SBNET cells grow mainly as spheroids and sometime as ellipsoids.\n4. Characterization of SBNETS spheroids by immunofluorescence\nTransfer the organoids grown in ECM to a 1.5 mL tube using a P1000 pipette.\nCentrifuge at 1,500 x g for 1 min and remove the supernatant.\nWash the organoid culture by adding 1 mL of PBS, mix, centrifuge at 1,500 x g for 1 min and remove the supernatant.\nFix the organoids by adding 500 µL of 4% paraformaldehyde and incubate for 15 min.\nWash the culture twice with 1 mL of PBS.\nPermeabilize the culture by adding 500 µL of PBS + 3% BSA + 0.1% Triton X 100 for 5 min.\nThen wash for three times with 1 mL of PBS + 3% BSA.\nIncubate for 1 h with primary antibodies against synaptophysin (SYP)10 at 1/600 dilution or chromogranin A (CgA)11 and somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2)12 at 1/400 dilution in antibody buffer (2.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% sodium azide, 25 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM sodium chloride).",
    "NOTE: Use 300 µL or more of antibody solution per tube.\nWash three times with 1 mL of PBS + 3% BSA.\nIncubate with secondary antibodies coupled to FITC at 1/500 dilution in antibody buffer for 1 h. Use 300 µL or more of antibody solution per tube.\nWash 3 times with 1 mL of PBS + 3% BSA. Make sure to aspirate and discard all the supernatant.\nAdd 5 µL of mounting medium containing the nuclear stain DAPI.\nUse a P20 pipette to transfer 5 µL of the SBNET spheroids from step 4.12 to a glass slide and seal with a cover slip.\nTake images using a fluorescent microscope using the 10x, 20x or 40x objectives.\n5. SBNET spheroids characterization by immunohistochemistry (IHC)\nTransfer SBNET spheroids from the culture plate to a 1.5 mL tube by using a P1000 pipette.\nCentrifuge at 1,500 x g for 1 min and remove the supernatant.\nFix SBNET spheroids by adding 500 µL of 10% formalin to the tube from step 5.2 and incubate at room temperature for 2-5 days prior to paraffin embedding and cut 4 µm thick spheroid sections.\nDeparaffinize, rehydrate, and use heat-induced epitope retrieval in Antigen Retrieval Solution at pH 9 by heating to 97 °C for 20 min using the 3-in-1 automated slide processing station to prepare slides for antibody incubation.\nBlock slides and incubate with primary antibodies against SYP10 at a 1/100 dilution for 15 min, CgA11 at a 1/800 dilution for 15 min, and SSTR212 at a 1/5,000 dilution for 30 min.\nIncubate with the secondary antibody detection system for 15 min for the anti-SYP and CgA staining and 30 min for anti-SSTR2 staining. Take pictures using a 400x objective.\n6. Treatment of SBNET organoids with rapamycin",
    "Dissolve rapamycin in DMSO to obtain a 10 mM stock solution.\nPrepare SBNET culture medium with DMSO (e.g., 1 mL of SBNET culture medium + 1 µL of DMSO) and SBNET culture medium with 10 µM of rapamycin (e.g., 1 mL of SBNET culture medium + 1 µL of 10 mM rapamycin stock solution).\nTransfer 200 µL media with SBNET culture medium with DMSO or 10 µM rapamycin to SBNET spheroid cultures.\nIncubate SBNET spheroids for 5 days in 37 °C incubator.\nAdd 1 µM of ethidium homodimer and incubate for 30 min. Remove the medium containing ethidium homodimer, wash with 200 µL of PBS, and transfer 200 µL of PBS to each well.\nTake microscopy images of SBNET spheroids with and without drug treatment using the red filter cube with the 10x, 20x, or 40x objectives of a fluorescent microscope.\n\tNOTE: Dead cells stained with Ethidium homodimer appears as red using the red filter cube G of a commercially available microscope (Table of Materials). Alternatively, the signal can be captured using a spectrophotometer at 535 nm excitation and 624 nm emission.\n7. Splitting SBNET spheroids\nNOTE: This is done for expansion and for sharing with other researchers.\nUse a P1000 pipette to mechanically break the ECM and aspirate the ECM with SBNET spheroids to a sterile 1.5 mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 1,000 x g at 4 °C, remove all the supernatant and place the tube on ice.\nAdd 2-4x the volume of new ECM to the pellet. Mix the new ECM with the old ECM and SBNET spheroids by pipetting up and down 10x. Avoiding introducing air bubbles.\nTransfer 5-20 µL of the ECM and SBNET spheroids mixture to a new plate and allow ECM to solidify.",
    "Cover with new SBNET medium and transfer to the incubator. The recovery rate is approximately 95 to 100%.\nFor shipping SBNET spheroids to another lab, transfer SBNET spheroids with new ECM to a T25 flask and allow ECM to solidify.\nFill the T25 flask with SBNET spheroid medium, screw on the cap tightly, and prepare shipment package.\nUpon receiving an SBNET spheroid culture, remove the culture medium and perform step 7.1 to 7.5 to put SBNET spheroids back in culture.\n8. Cryostorage and recovery of SBNET spheroids\nTransfer SBNET spheroids from 5-10 small wells to a 15 mL tube. Centrifuge at 500 x g for 15 min at 4 °C, remove supernatant, resuspend in freezing medium (90% FBS + 10% DMSO), store in a cell freezing container, and place this at -80 °C.\nTransfer to the liquid nitrogen for longer storage.\nTo recover SBNET spheroids, place the frozen vial on ice and wait until the content is completely thawed. Invert the tube and re-place on ice in order to speed up the thawing process.\nOnce the sample is thawed, placed inside a pre-chilled centrifuge and spin at 1,000 x g for 10 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the spheroids in ECM. Keep the tube on ice, transfer 20 µL to a new plate, and wait for the ECM to solidify.\nTransfer 200 µL of SBNET culture medium with 10 µM of ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632)13 and transfer to the incubator.\nAllow SBNET spheroids to recover and grow for 1 week. Remove the old culture medium, replenish with 200 µL of SBNET culture medium and return to the incubator.\nAllow SBNET spheroids to continue to grow.",
    "NOTE: It takes at least 1 week for rapidly growing spheroids to start to recover after cryopreservation13. SBNET spheroids take a minimum of 2-4 weeks to start growing. Many SBNET cells will die within the first 2 weeks and the survival rate is less than 10%. Since this is a very time-consuming and low yield process, it is better to share with other researchers SBNET spheroids in culture flasks (as described in step 7). Cryostorage and recovery should only be used as a backup plan in case of a bacterial contamination occurs.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
