    "The following protocol follows the departmental clinical guidelines and is adherent to the institution’s human research ethics guidelines.\n1. Prepare for MRI Data Acquisition\nConduct a safety screening.\nEvaluate for renal impairment8.\n\t\t\nAvoid gadolinium contrast in patients with stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.71 m2) not on chronic dialysis, patients with end-stage renal disease on chronic dialysis, and patients with known or suspected acute kidney injury due to concerns for NSF.\nDetermine necessity for sedation9.\nNOTE: Moderate sedation or general anesthesia allows completion of the examination for patients suffering from anxiety or claustrophobia or pediatric patients.\n\t\t\nAdminister a lorazepam tablet up to 1 mg orally prior to scanning for patients with claustrophobia. Driving or machinery operation after medication administration is contraindicated.\nEvaluate for implanted devices9.\n\t\t\nPerform a careful review of the patient’s history and safety to identify implanted devices that may be hazardous in the CMR environment or create image artifact.\nDetermine MR compatibility of patient implanted devices. Each case is reviewed for risks and benefits. The proper personnel are required to be present during the examination if CMR is to be performed in patients with non-MR safe devices.\nObtain radiographs to assist with screening, particularly orbit radiographs when there is possible history of metal fragments within the eye. Perform posterior-anterior radiographs with eyes up, eyes down, and a lateral view.\nProvide patient instructions.\nDeliver breathing instructions10.\n\t\t\nPerform breath holding at end expiration as reproducibility is higher compared to inspiratory breath holds. For CMR, use the typical breath hold command: “breathe in, breathe out, stop breathing”.\nProvide patient with headphones connected to the technologist microphone so commands can be efficiently conveyed.",
    "Perform free-breathing protocol when patient is unable to hold-breath for the exam due to sedation or medical condition. Free breathing protocols increase the number of averages (excitations) up to 4 and allow adequate free breathing image acquisition. Free breathing protocols can be selected from typical scanner exam libraries.\nSetup physiological monitoring10.\nPlace electrocardiogram (ECG) leads in optimal positions on the left chest, and confirm adequate ECG signal.\nPosition the patient on the MRI scanner.\nEnsure an appropriate surface coil size is chosen to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio over the heart. Often a dedicated cardiac coil is selected for optimal performance. Signal to noise correlates directly with image quality and is visually evident during scanning\nReduce field of view to maintain adequate spatial resolution. FOV is changed in the scanner settings directly and is dependent on patient size\n2. Acquire the MRI Data [Cardiac MR without and with IV Contrast Limited] Focused Scan to Evaluated Potential Cardiac Thrombus\nNOTE: Basic scan sequences are often loaded by the MRI technologist from scan libraries that are present on each MRI scanner. Standard cardiac scan prescription and orientations are also considered routine operating tasks for MRI technologists.\nObtain the Scout T1-weighted fast spin-echo including the trans-axial localizing stack1.\nNOTE: This constitutes the first scan for each MRI exam and allows further sequences to be prescribed using spatial localization.\nObtain the Bright-blood, cine SSFP gradient-echo – axial stack with full heart coverage. This sequence offers the most consistent mass delineation and correlation with other radiology studies.\nObtain short axis, 2 chamber, 3 chamber, and 4-chamber planes as needed depending on clinical indications. Scan plane prescriptions are discussed in detail in Boegart11.",
    "NOTE: These acquisitions are non-dependent on flow effects which allow for short TR, improve temporal resolution, and permit determination of mobility of a thrombus. SSFP provides high SNR and CNR due to intrinsic contrast properties between myocardium and blood pool.\nPerform the tissue characterization module1,2,3,11,12.\nObtain the black-blood triple inversion recovery.\nNOTE: This provides excellent contrast resolution for determining the size and the extent of the mass. It is useful for characterizing myocardial edema associated with mass or cystic component of mass and in detecting fat within the mass.\n\t\t\nObtain the black-blood double inversion recovery if there is a benefit of a bright fat signal. This is run as a separate sequence available in most CMR scanner sequence libraries where blood pool and myocardium signal are nulled while fat remains bright.\nPerform the first-pass arterial perfusion module1,2,3,11,12.\nObtain T1-weighted fat-saturated volumetric contrast-enhanced images; the axial plane is often most universal for mass visualization.\n\t\t\nBegin imaging during contrast administration of 0.05–0.1 mmol/kg injected at 3–4 mL/s.\nImage until the contrast passes through the LV myocardium (40–50 heart beats).\nNOTE: A vascular tumor enhances during perfusion sequences while a thrombus does not enhance.\nPerform the post gadolinium delayed viability module1,2,3,11,12.\nObtain phase sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR), (~10 min post injection) 6–8 mm slices with inversion time set to null thrombus, to differentiate the thrombus from the tumor or delineate the thrombus surrounding or associated with the tumor.\n\t\t\nSet the scan “time to inversion” (TI time) which changes in real time based on gadolinium kinetics and is typically set at 200–450 ms at 1.5 T; 300–550 ms at 3 T. Set a new TI time into the scanner for each PSIR sequence run, which is usually higher than the previous time based on gadolinium kinetics.",
    "NOTE: Serial imaging can be performed to distinguish hypo-perfused tumor necrotic core from thrombus. This is performed by repeating the PSIR sequence at multiple time points to evaluate gadolinium kinetics with the region of concern.\nConsider obtaining emerging sequences13,14,15,16,17,18,19.\nObtain native T1 mapping (multiple protocols available).\nNOTE: For example, use a single shot inversion recovery readout with a 5(3)3 scheme: inversion followed by 5 acquisition heartbeats, 3 recovery heartbeats, an additional inversion followed by 3 heartbeats.\nObtain post contrast T1 mapping (extracellular volume fraction).\nNOTE: Post contrast Extracellular volume (ECV) represents a gadolinium-based measurement of the size of the extracellular space which primarily reflects interstitial disease. ECV is calculated by comparing the changes in relaxivity of myocardium and blood pool prior to and following the administration of the IV contrast agent. Serum hematocrit is necessary to calculate ECV.\nObtain T2 mapping.\nNOTE: T2 mapping can be derived from bright-blood T2 prepped SSFP sequence. Accurate application of T2 mapping requires a reference range for normal T2w signal; however, large interpatient variability of myocardial T2 signal can affect interpretation of results.\nObtain a cardiac triggered 3D spoiled gradient echo acquisition named 3D-QALAS (3D quantification).\nNOTE: This sequence uses an interleaved look-locker acquisition sequence with T2-preparation and has been shown to be a feasible option for myocardial T1 and T2 mapping in a single breath hold.\n3. Analysis of the MRI data\nPerform post-processing2,20.\nUse an FDA-approved software for processing data either as part of the MRI system or on a separate workstation.\nNOTE: Post-processing is performed or supervised by the cardiac MRI physician and appropriately documented in the report.\nAssess ventricular chambers.\nPerform visual analysis of global and segmental function and wall motion. Look for any wall motion abnormalities in all obtained planes.",
    "Perform quantitative analysis of ventricular volumes and wall thicknesses. Ensure there is no abnormal thickening (>13 mm) or thinning of the left ventricular myocardium, which could suggest underlying pathology.\nEvaluate T2-weighted imaging.\nVisually analyze to detect or exclude regions of increased myocardial signal intensity indicating edema. For cardiac thrombus evaluation, the thrombus can have increased T2w signal intensity in the subacute time period and low T2w signal intensity in the chronic time period.\nPerform semi-quantitative analysis of T2 signal intensity ratios, if needed. Using Picture Archiving and Communication Software (PACS), draw an ROI over a portion of the LV myocardium and compare the LV T2 signal to skeletal muscle ROI signal. This can be useful in ruling out myocarditis.\nEvaluate perfusion imaging.\nPerform visual analysis to identify regions of relative hypoperfusion. In cardiac thrombus evaluation, the mass in question is carefully analyzed for any internal post contrast increased signal, which would suggest against thrombus and signify the presence of vascular tumor.\nEvaluate late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging within myocardium and any suspected masses.\nPerform visual analysis to assess for the presence and the pattern of LGE. No solid regions of internal LGE are expected within a thrombus. However, a thin linear component of LGE can be seen along the outer margin of thrombus.\nPerform visual analysis of location and extent of LGE.\nPerform quantitative analysis with T1 mapping. Post processing software is used. Motion corrected sequences are used for analysis. Draw a region of interest over the mass of interest and over the myocardial regions of concern and record the pertinent T1 relaxation times.\nNOTE: This is potentially helpful in distinguishing a thrombus from a tumor by providing quantitative assessment of pre-contrast T1 relaxation times.\nGenerate the report20,21.\nInclude general study information.",
    "Document the study site, scanner information including the manufacturer and the model, the field strength, and the software platform.\nDocument patient demographics.\nDocument the patient ID, gender, and date of birth.\nDocument the referring physician and service.\nInclude study performance information.\n\t\t\nDocument the date and time of examination, the personnel involved, the indication for examination, and the list of sequences used.\nDocument the patient history and risk factors.\nDocument the height, the weight, the heart rate, and the electrocardiogram interpretation.\nDocument the contrast agent administered, the route, and the dose.\nDocument the amount, the type, the route, and the dose of sedation, if applicable.\nReport the cardiovascular imaging features.\n\t\t\nDescribe the cardiac size and function based on qualitative and quantitative assessment.\n\t\t\t\nReport the cardiac mass and describe the location, the anatomic relationships, the 3-dimensional size, and the morphology.\nReport the mass T1- and T2-weighted signal characteristics of the mass. Classically, a thrombus will have low T1 and T2 signals. However, the T2w signal can vary with the age of blood products.\nReport the first pass perfusion pattern of the mass. The thrombus should have no internal perfusion.\nReport the late gadolinium enhancement pattern of the mass. Thrombus generally has no internal LGE but may have thin linear LGE signal around the periphery.\nReport the mass motion on cine imaging and its effect on myocardial contractility.\nProvide concluding statements synthesizing the findings into a comprehensive impression\nSubscription Required.
