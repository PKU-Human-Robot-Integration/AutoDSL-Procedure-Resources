    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSuperovulation of mice\nTiming: 3 days (30–60 min for each hormone injection)\nThis step describes how to prime the female mice with hormones to induce superovulation. It helps to get many embryos (10–30 blastocysts per mouse) on a given date.\nPrepare 5 week-old or 12–16 week-old female mice (see problem 1 under troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nDefrost the PMSG stock on ice.\nUsing an insulin syringe, inject 5–6 units of PMSG (100–120 μL) by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection between 14:00–15:00 (day -2).\n46–48 h after PMSG injection, defrost the hCG stock on ice just before use.\nInject 5–6 units of hCG (100–120 μL) by i.p. injection between 13:00–14:00 (day 0).\nNote: After defrosting, the hormones should be kept on ice while preparing for the injection.\nNote: PMSG can be stored up to 1 month in a 4°C fridge, but we do not recommend storing the remaining hCG in a 4°C fridge because of a sharp decrease in hormone activity during storage.\nPlace the females into the stud male cages around 18:00–20:00 (day 0).\nAlternatives: It is fine to start the breeding immediately after hCG injection, if necessary.\nNext morning (07:00–09:00), check for the presence of a plug on the females' vagina (day 1, E0.5) (See problem 1 under troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nPreparation of irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)\nTiming: 30–40 min\nThis step describes how to prepare MEF plates before the main experiment of derivation. One or two days before E3.5 blastocyst flushing or E6.5 conceptus dissection, prepare a 96-well cell culture plate with gamma ray-irradiated MEF.",
    "Alternatives: Gamma ray-irradiation can be replaced by Mitomycin C (MMC) treatment. Treat MEF with MMC (10 μg/mL in MEF medium) for 1–2 h before your experiment (Fisher Scientific). Remove the MMC and wash the MEF several times with PBS to ensure that no MMCs remain.\nPrepare MEFs by purchasing commercial one or by extracting them from mouse embryos according to established protocols.15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]\nNote: Although the mouse origin of MEFs might vary for each laboratory situation and protocols, we have achieved better results when using MEFs isolated from E13.5 DR4 rather than C57BL/6J mouse strains.\nCoat each well of a 96-well cell culture plate with 50 μL of 0.1% gelatin in PBS, and incubate the plate at 37°C for at least 5 min.\nNote: Plates including gelatin can be stored in the incubator for long periods so as to maintain a stock ready-to-go.\nPrewarm the MEF medium or the washing buffer at 37°C in a water bath or at 20°C–25°C in a hood.\nTake the MEF stock vials from liquid nitrogen and place them into the 37°C water bath until only a small ice clump is left.\nAlternatives: You can also add 1–2 mL of pre-warmed medium into each MEF vial, and defrost them through gentle pipetting. However, shear stress can decrease cell viability.\nTransfer the MEFs into the 10 mL of pre-warmed MEF medium or washing buffer in a 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge the MEFs at 200 g for 4 min.\nRemove the supernatant from the tube, and tap the pellet several times with the remaining washing buffer to roughly dissociate it.\nResuspend the MEF pellet with the pre-warmed MEF medium.\nRemove the gelatin solution from the 96-well plate.\nAdd 20,000–25,000 MEF cells per well and incubate the plate in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.",
    "Note: Defrost MEFs 1 day before use, for example the morning before, and check the attachment, quality, and confluency of the cells, for example before leaving on the same day. Eventually re-adjust the confluency by defrosting another vial if attachment and/or viability is lower than expected.\nCritical: For the blastocyst or ExE culture (passage 0) and for the first passage, MEFs need to be exposed to serum-free TXV medium for a relatively long time (around 1 week), which is challenging for them, as they can easily detach from the plate. To compensate, the confluency of MEFs should be higher than in other experiments (e.g., ESCs culture), and medium change should be performed very carefully (See problem 2 under troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nPreparation of E3.5 blastocysts\nTiming: 2–3 h\nThis step describes how to flush E3.5 blastocysts from the uterus of plug positive pregnant female mice.\nChange the medium of MEF coated 96-well plate from MEF medium to 200 μL of TXV medium. Place them back in the humidified incubator (37°C with 5% CO2) to prewarm the TXV medium for about 1 h before the deposition of the blastocysts or ExE tissues.\nNote: LPA and cAMP should be added freshly to the TXV medium to ensure optimal activity.\nSacrifice the plug positive female mice 3.5 days after plugging (day 4; 3 days after plug check).\nNote: Theoretically, for E3.5 blastocysts, females need to be sacrificed around 09:00, considering that mating and fertilization happens rapidly after gathering the males and females. However, for this experiment, the time point is not so critical because morula or early blastocysts will develop to the full-blown blastocyst stage in vitro, subsequently allowing for the derivation of TESCs.\nDissect uterus with the ovary and the upper cervix, and place them in PBS.",
    "Critical: In order not to crush the blastocysts, do not directly grab the uterus with forceps but rather use the ovary or cervix to handle the organs. One can easily distinguish the cervix from the uterus based on color (cervix: relatively white, while the uterus is pink or reddish. See Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2538-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Dissection and flushing of E3.5 uterus\n(A) E3.5 uterus. Cervix and uterus are distinguishable by colors. Scale bar: 1 cm.\n(B) Procedures how to dissect E3.5 uterus for blastocyst flushing. Removal of ovaries is optional.\n(C) M2 medium on a 35 mm dish and a 4-ring well plate.\n(D and E) (D) Insertion of needle into one horn of E3.5 uterus, and (E) magnified image. The inserted needle needs to be tightly held by forceps. Related to steps 20–26.\nNote: Although pregnant females tend to have a more vascularized uterus, it is difficult to evaluate whether the female is pregnant or not based on the uterus morphology. Not to lose blastocysts, take and flush every uterus.\nAfter a brief wash with PBS, remove the fat tissues containing blood vessels that are on the mesometrium region of the uterus (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nPrepare one drop of M2 medium in the center of a 35 mm dish and in a 4-ring well plate (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nNote: We recommend you use a 35 mm dish rather than 60 mm or 100 mm dishes since it is easier to find the blastocysts if we use smaller dishes.\nNote: One well of a 4-ring well plate can contain 100–120 μL of M2 medium.\nPrepare a syringe filled with M2 medium.",
    "Cut out the cervix from the uterus and the center of two horns of the uterus (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). You might also cut ovaries. Put one horn in the M2 medium of the 35 mm dish.\nNote: It is not necessary to remove the ovaries. They might help in identifying the direction of the uterus.\nInsert the syringe needle into the ovary-side of the uterus horn and hold the tip of the needle and the horn together with forceps to prevent the needle from detaching from the horn during the flushing (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D and 1E) (See problem 3 under troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nBy slowly pushing 300–500 μL of M2 medium, flush the uterus.\nRepeat steps 24–26 for the remaining uterus.\nNote: Use a new 35 mm dish once the dish has more than 2–3 mL of flushed M2 medium. After several flushings, both the presence of many debris and the thickness of the medium layer make it difficult to find the blastocysts.\nPrepare the mouth pipette and fill up the capillary with M2 medium.\nUsing the mouth pipette, select the blastocysts using a stereo microscope and transfer them to a ring of a 4-ring well plate (See problem 4 under troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nNote: In most cases, you will find sphere-shaped early and late blastocysts, but also some arrested cleavage-stage embryos, some morula, and few oval shaped, elongated or crushed late blastocysts. Such deformed late blastocysts are also good for TESC derivation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2538-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Preparation of MEF and blastocysts\n(A) Examples of Morula and blastocysts in different developmental stages. After hatching, late blastocyst does not have ZP. Scale bar: 100 μm. ZP: zona pellucida.\n(B) Examples of MEFs for the cell outgrowth and passaging. MEF should be highly confluent for the cell outgrowth. Scale bar: 300 μm. Related to steps 29–32.",
    "To remove the red blood cells and debris present in the medium, wash the morulae and blastocysts 2 times with M2 medium by transferring them from one ring well to another.\nPrepare the mouth pipette and fill the bended capillary up with TXV medium.\nUse the mouth pipette to take the morulae and blastocysts and place one per well in the center of one well of MEF coated 96-well plate and including prewarmed TXV medium. Incubate the plates in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nNote: Check MEFs again if the MEFs are highly confluent (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B, left). After 2nd passage, one can use less confluent MEFs (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B, right; step 64).",
    "Note: Removal of the Zona pellucida (ZP) is not necessary since most blastocysts will hatch from ZP in a few days after settling down onto the MEF. If you want, you can remove the ZP using a Tyrode's acid solution before placing them in the wells of the MEF coated 96-well plate. Make few drops of Tyrode's acid solution on an any petri dish (30–40 μL per drop). Transfer blastocysts to the drop using a mouth pipette, and suck the blastocysts up before they fall down to the bottom of the dish since blastocysts become very sticky after removal of the ZP. Once a blastocyst attaches to the dish, you cannot use it anymore. Repeat sucking and blowing blastocysts 5 to 10 times in a Tyrode's acid drop. Transfer the blastocysts to another drop of Tyrode's acid solution, and repeat again sucking and blowing blastocysts 5 to 10 times. To prevent losing them, wash them immediately and several times using 0.4% of BSA in PBS using a mouth pipette previously filled up with 0.4% of BSA in PBS but not TXV medium, and then transfer them into the wells of the MEF coated 96-well plate.\nCritical: Do not disturb the 96-well plate for at least 2 days as the initial adhesion process should not be disturbed.\nPreparation and dissection of E6.5 conceptus\nTiming: 4–6 h\nThis step describes how to dissect E6.5 conceptus from the uterus of pregnant mice to extract the extraembryonic ectoderm (ExE).\nChange the medium of the MEF coated 96-well plate from MEF medium to 200 μL of TXV medium. Place the plates back in the humidified incubator (37°C with 5% CO2) to prewarm the TXV medium.\nNote: LPA and cAMP should be added to the TXV medium freshly to ensure optimal activity.",
    "Sacrifice the plug positive female mice 6.5 days after plugging (day 7; 6 days after plug check).\nTake the uteri out, and place them in PBS.\nNote: At E6.5, you will clearly see the deciduae if the female has implanted concepti. As such, you do not have to proceed further if you do not find any bulb on the uterus (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2538-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. E6.5 Uterus and decidua dissection\n(A) E6.5 uterus with implanted concepti.\n(B) The uterus needs to be cut so that each piece has one decidua.\n(C) Pieces of the uterus with one decidua per piece.\n(D) Schematic figure explaining how to dissect E6.5 deciduae.\n(E) Removal of the uterine wall. Find hole (hole 1) and stretch it using two forceps.\n(F) Extraction of the E6.5 concepti from the decidua. Find a hole (hole 2) after cutting the sharp end of the decidua, and stretch it using one forceps. Scale bars: 1 cm in (A–C); 1 mm in (E and F). Related to steps 35–44. See also Methods videos S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] and S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2].\nAfter a brief wash in PBS, remove the fat tissues with blood vessels on the mesometrium region of the uterus (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nCut the uterus with scissors (perpendicular to the main direction of the uterus) so that each piece contains one decidua (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B–3D).\nPlace these pieces in a new 60 mm dish with PBS.\nInsert the tip of two fine forceps into the hole formed by the uterus cutting (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D). Tear the uterine wall horizontally, and gently smooth down only the uterine wall from side to side with forceps so as to detach the decidua from the uterine wall (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E; Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nPut the naked deciduae in a new 60 mm dish filled with PBS.",
    "The naked deciduae have an asymmetrical oval shape with one side being larger than the other (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D). Hold the large side (blunt end) with forceps and cut off the 1/6 to 1/5 point from the small side (sharp end) with fine forceps (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F; Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S1. Peeling the uterine wall from E6.5 decidua, related to step 39\n    \nNote: Under optimal breeding, the deciduae rarely have two concepti, and rarely does not contain a conceptus. After cutting the sharp end of the decidua, you can evaluate the number of concepti in each decidua by evaluating the amount of ‘reddish debris’ (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F; Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]). This helps to eventually discard the deciduae that do not have a conceptus. In normal cases, you will find one clump of reddish debris. Two reddish debris on one cut means two concepti, while no reddish debris means an empty decidua.\nInsert two tips of fine forceps very gently along the edge of the hole of the decidua which was made by decidua cutting.\nCritical: Since the conceptus is inside the hole (hole 2) (in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F), you should be very careful not to stab it with the tips of fine forceps.\nGently spread the two tips of fine forceps apart until the decidua is split in two pieces.\nTake the transparent conceptus and transfer it into a 35 mm dish filled with 0.4% BSA (in PBS).\nCritical: You have to keep the ectoplacental cone (EPC) that is linked to the ExE (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S2.

EPC, ectoplacental cone; ExE, extraembryonic ectoderm; EPI, epiblast; VE, visceral endoderm; PE, parietal endoderm. Related to step 45. See also Methods videos S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3] and S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4].\nCritical: The Reicher’s membrane is usually removed naturally when you follow the protocol. But if you find such a membrane, you should remove it. Since it is transparent and resides very close to the embryo, be careful not to damage the embryo when you remove the membrane (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nHold the linkage of the EPC and the ExE using forceps and, using other forceps, squeeze the boundary of the epiblast (EPI) and of the extraembryonic ectoderm (ExE) to gently pull out the EPI part (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B and 4D). By pulling the EPI part away from the ExE part, one can also peel the visceral endoderm (VE) from the ExE, thus extracting a pure ExE tissue (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C; Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).",
    "Critical: The VE encloses both the ExE and the EPI. By gently squeezing the boundary of the EPI and the ExE, you can both detach the ExE from the EPI and peel the VE off. However, do not squeeze the boundary harshly so as to avoid cutting the EPI and the VE off completely (See problem 5 under troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nCritical: Since the linkage of the ExE and the EPC is fragile, you might lose this linkage when you grab the boundary of EPI and ExE improperly. For example, if you stretch the conceptus after holding only a small part of VE rather than whole EPI, you might lose the linkage because of a strong extending tension (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E; Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]) (See problem 5 under troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S3. Extraction of extraembryonic ectoderm (ExE) from the E6.5 embryo, related to step 45\n    \nNote: The ExE is distinguishable from the VE based on tissue color difference (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D and 4E).\nAlternatives: You can extract ExE with chemical dissociation by using Trypsin/pancreatin.16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]",
    "Note: By using physical dissociation, you might have more advantages as compared to chemical dissociation. Here are 4 issues during chemical dissociation. First, you might lose your samples because it becomes sticky and viscous after dissociation, making it difficult to detach the ExE from the VE and even from forceps. Second, it is difficult to distinguish the concepti in the dissociation solutions because Trypsin/pancreatin solution on ice easily forms clumps whose color is very similar to that of the concepti. Third, incubation time on Trypsin/pancreatin is critical for the dissociation (prolonged incubation will make your samples viscous and you will lose them). If you handle many concepti, it will not be easy to timely control the dissociation process. Fourth, even though you extract the ExE using a chemical dissociation, its cells tend to have a decreased survivability in culture, as compared to the ones of physically dissociated ExE (5/13 = 38.5% from chemical dissociation, 12/13 = 92.3% from physical dissociation). In our hands, chemical dissociation also increases XEN cell contamination (6/13 = 46.2% from chemical dissociation, 0/12 = 0.0% from physical dissociation).\nRemove the remaining EPC part from the ExE.\nTransfer the ExE to a new 35 mm dish containing 0.4% BSA (in PBS) 1–2 times in order to wash out the debris.\nPrepare a 20p pipette and tips, and fill them with 0.4% BSA (in PBS) to coat the inside of the tips.\nUsing the pipette and the BSA-coated 20p tips, harvest the ExE with 5 μL of 0.4% BSA (in PBS).\nPlace only one ExE in the center of one well of MEF coated 96-well plate including pre-warmed TXV medium. Incubate them in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nCritical: Do not disturb the 96-well plate for at least 2 days.",

Extraction of extraembryonic ectoderm (ExE) from E6.5 the embryo without ectoplacental cone (EPC) linkage, related to step 45\n    \nCulture of cellular outgrowths and TESCs derivation\nTiming: 3–5 weeks\nThis step describes how to culture and passage the cellular outgrowths from either blastocysts and ExEs, and TESC colonies, and how to transfer TESC colonies from MEF plates to MEF-free laminin 521-coated plates.\nTwo days after placing the blastocysts or ExEs on MEF, gently take out 100 μL out of the 200 μL of TXV medium present in each well, and add 100 μL of fresh TXV medium including a doubled concentration of the 8 factors (FGF4, Heparin, TGF-β1, Activin A, BMP7, IL-11, cAMP, LPA).\nNote: You can make 2× TXV medium (without cAMP and LPA), and store it in a 4°C fridge for up to 2 weeks. However, cAMP and LPA should be added freshly to ensure optimal activity.\nRepeat step 51 every 2 days until large cellular outgrowths have formed (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2538-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Various examples of cell outgrowth that are ready to be dissociated\n(A and B) (A) E3.5 blastocysts cultured for 6 days and (B) E6.5 ExE cultured for 2 days. All cellular outgrowths in this figure formed TESC colonies after cell passaging. Scale bars: 100 μm in (A); 200 μm in (B). Related to step 52.\nCritical: Avoid over-growth. Usually, cellular outgrowths need to be dissociated within 4–6 days (from E3.5 blastocysts) or 2–3 days (from E6.5 ExEs) (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 5B). However, each individual case should be considered every day from day 2 onward.\nNote: Around 8% of samples may not form a cellular outgrowth.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] You do not have to proceed further steps with these samples.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2538_17.csv\nPassage 1",
    "Prepare MEF in a 96-well plate (MEF medium, 20,000–25,000 cells per well) 1 day before dissociation of the cellular outgrowths.\nNote: The number of MEF needs to be adjusted according to the confluency of MEF. See also steps 9–17.\nJust before the dissociation of the cellular outgrowth, change the medium of MEF coated 96-well plate from MEF medium to 120 μL of TXV medium. Place them back into the humidified incubator to prewarm the TXV medium.\nCritical: 2 μM of Y-27632 (Rock inhibitor) must be added for enhanced attachment of the TESCs. No need to add Y-27632 when changing medium for already attached TESCs.\nRemove the TXV medium from each well that contains a cellular outgrowth, and wash them with PBS.\nAspirate the PBS and add 35 μL of 1× TrypLE per well containing the cellular outgrowths.\nCritical: Use TrypLE but not Trypsin nor Trypsin-EDTA, as Trypsin does not lose its activity even after adding a large volume of TXV medium thus deteriorating or killing the cells. Using Trypsin will dramatically decrease cell viability.\nIncubate for 8 min at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nNote: To avoid long-time exposure of the cellular outgrowth to TrypLE, do not incubate more than 8 samples at a time. Considering the cellular viability and the time-efficiency, we recommend dissociating 6–8 samples at a time.\nAfter 8 min of incubation in TrypLE, gently pipet the cellular outgrowths until they dissociate into single cells. This can be monitored under conventional microscopes.\nAdd 200 μL of TXV medium onto the dissociated cells, and mix well.\nTransfer the total of 235 μL of dissociated cells into the new well of MEF coated 96-well plates already including 120 μL of TXV medium per well (from step 54).\nIncubate the plates in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.",
    "Note: Be careful when you move the plate since each well is rather filled with medium.\nNote: Do not disturb the 96-well plate for at least 2 days.\nTwo days after cell dissociation, aspirate all medium and add 200 μL of fresh TXV medium.\nEvery 2 days, gently take out 100 μL of TXV medium from each well, and add 100 μL of fresh TXV medium with doubled concentration of the 8 factors until you observe large colonies of TESCs (see Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2538-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Various examples of TESC colonies\n(A and B) (A) On MEF (p1) and (B) On Laminin 521 (p3 on MEF, and p3 after plate conversion from MEF to Laminin 521). During the early passages on MEF, TESCs form very tight and compact colonies. XEN cells are relatively smaller and more spread than TESCs, and have spherical shape as compared to TESCs. Arrows indicate TESC colonies. Scale bars: 200 μm in (A and B). Related to steps 53–113, especially steps 63 and 98.\nNote: Typically, you will find small colonies around 3–4 days after cell passaging. Wait a few more days until the TESC colonies have sufficiently large sizes (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nNote: You might find contamination with other cell types (e.g., XEN cells) with low probability (11% for E3.5 blastocyst (5/46), and no case for E6.5 ExE (0/12)) (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A). Not every but some of these contaminated samples including other cell types will become enriched in TESCs when they are further exposed to TXV medium for a couple of additional passages.\nPassage 2\nPrepare MEF in a 48-well plate (MEF medium) at least 1 day before dissociation of TESC colonies.",
    "Note: For a short-time culture (3–4 days) after the second passage, we did not observe that the TXV medium led to significant problems for MEF culture (e.g., detachment of MEF from plate, cell death).\nWhen the size of colonies is large enough, remove the TXV medium from each well and wash them with PBS.\nAspirate the PBS, and add 35 μL of 1× TrypLE per well.\nIncubate the plates for 6 min in 37°C with 5% CO2.\nDuring that time, change the medium of the MEF coated 48-well plate from MEF medium to 300 μL of TXV medium. Place these plates back into the humidified incubator to prewarm the TXV medium.\nAfter 6 min of incubation in TrypLE, gently pipet the samples until they form a single cell suspension.\nAdd 200 μL of TXV medium onto the dissociated cell solution, and mix well.\nTransfer the total volume of 235 μL into the well of the MEF coated 48-well plate that already contains 300 μL of TXV medium per well.\nIncubate them at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nNote: From the second passage, you can observe clear TESC colonies already 2 days after cell passaging.\nPassage 3\nPrepare the MEFs in a 12-well plate (MEF medium) at least 1 day before dissociation of the TESC colonies.\nWhen the size of the colonies is large enough, remove the TXV medium from each well and wash them with PBS.\nAspirate the PBS, and add 70–80 μL of 1× TrypLE per well.\nIncubate the plates for 6 min in 37°C with 5% CO2.\nIn the meantime, prepare 1.0–1.5 mL of washing buffer in 1.5–2.0 mL tubes.\nChange the medium of the MEF-coated 12-well plate from MEF medium to 1 mL of TXV medium. Place them back into the humidified incubator to prewarm the TXV medium.",

Instead, use a wash buffer and centrifuge them to remove remaining TrypLE and resuspend the cells in pure TXV medium.\nPassage 4 (passage 1 after plate conversion)\nPrepare the MEF in a 12-well plate (MEF medium) at least 1 day before dissociation of the TESC colonies.\nPrepare the Laminin 521 (L521) coatings in a different 12-well plate at least 4 h before the dissociation of TESC colonies. Keep the plate at 37°C with 5% CO2 incubator.\nNote: You can keep the L521-coated plates in the fridge for up to 2 weeks by sealing them with parafilm to prevent the evaporation of the solution. To properly coat the plates with L521, it is required to keep the L521 solution in the plate and in the fridge at least for 1 day. In such a case, you do not have to incubate the plate at 37°C with 5% CO2 incubator before cell passaging.\nNote: You need 500–700 μL of L521 to coat one well of a 12-well plate.",
    "When the size of the colonies is large enough, remove the TXV medium from each well and wash them with PBS.\nAspirate the PBS and add 250 μL of Accutase per well.\nNote: Accutase is milder than TrypLE and is preferred upon passaging to laminin coated plates. To minimize cell damage by dissociation reagents, we strongly recommend use of Accutase instead of TrypLE or Trypsin-EDTA.\nIncubate the plates for 6 min at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nIn the meantime, prepare 3–4 mL of washing buffer in 15 mL tubes.\nChange the solution of the laminin-coated 12-well plates to 1.2 mL of TXV medium.

We typically try this conversion after the third passage (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nNote: When attempting plate conversion from MEF- to L521-coated plates, 3–10 times more cells should be seeded as compared to normal cell passaging because many TESCs will not firmly attach to the plate.\nNote: We highly recommend seeding remaining TESCs on MEF-coated plates as a backup in case the conversion to laminin culture fails.\nIncubate the plates at 37°C with 5% CO2.",

This staining procedure is applied to both ESCs and TESCs.\nNote: TESC Derivation (steps 51–113) → IF of 2D TESCs (steps 114–124) → making blastoid with the TESCs (steps 125–143) → IF of the blastoid (steps 114–124).",
    "Remove the TXV medium from each well and wash them with PBS.\nNote: Check if your microscope and your culture dishes are compatible for imaging.\nAlternatives: You can use specific dishes for high quality imaging (e.g., glass bottom plate, ibiTreat plastic plate).\nAspirate the PBS, and add 1 mL of 4% Formaldehyde solution (FA. Or add paraformaldehyde, PFA) for one well of a 6-well plate.

Incubate them for 30 min in 20°C–25°C.\nRemove the 0.3% PBS-T solution and add a blocking buffer. Incubate them for at least 1 h at 20°C–25°C.\nNote: When making the blocking buffer, it is recommended to use serum of the same species as the secondary antibody host. For example, if you want to use anti-rabbit goat 488 and anti-rabbit donkey 488 secondary antibodies, use goat and donkey serum for blocking buffers, respectively.\nNote: If you want to pause after this step, you can keep the samples at 4°C overnight.\nPrepare a primary antibody solution with the blocking buffer. Incubate the samples with the primary antibody solution at 4°C overnight.\nNote: We used CDX2/EOMES and NANOG/OCT4 for the trophoblast and epiblast markers, respectively. One can also use GATA3 as a trophoblast marker. As controls, we also prepared well-established ESC and TSC lines (e.g., V6.5 ESCs and F4-GFP TSCs) (See also Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2538-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

    "(A) Immunofluorescence for epiblast and trophoblast lineage markers in ESCs and TSCs. EOMES was also detected in ESCs, with a cytoplasmic but not nuclear localization, suggesting a non-specific background signal. On the contrary, EOMES in TESCs is clearly detected in the nucleus of cells.\n(B) Blastoids generated with ESCs-H2B-mTurquoise and either F4-GFP or LB-A5 TESCs, and immunofluorescence for CDX2. Both blastoids established a polar-mural CDX2 axis, like late blastocysts. ESCs were identified by naive mTurquoise signals. Scale bars: 200 μm in (A); 50 μm in (B). Related to steps 115–124.\nAlternatives: You can incubate your samples with the primary antibody solution at 20°C–25°C for 2 h. However, the intensity of fluorescence might decrease, while the background signal might increase.\nWash the samples with 0.1% PBS-T (5 min × at least 3 times).\nPrepare a secondary antibody solution by adding the secondary antibodies and Hoechst in the blocking buffer. Incubate the samples with the secondary antibody solution for 1 h at 20°C–25°C.\nWash them with 0.1% PBS-T (5 min × at least 3 times).\nWash out the remaining 0.1% PBS-T with PBS, and image your samples (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A).\nOnce you have confirmed that the newly derived cell lines express trophoblast lineage markers but not epiblast markers, you can engage in making blastoids11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11],17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17] to assess the functional potential of cells to recapitulate aspects of trophectoderm development (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B).\nNote: We routinely use multiple lines of V6.5 ESCs (in 2i-Lif medium on 0.1% gelatin-coated plate) and F4-GFP or new derived TESCs (in TXV on L521 coated plate) to form blastoids.\nNote: If the new derived cell lines are not genuine TESCs, they don't form a blastocoel-like cavity, but rather compact cellular aggregates.\nBlastoid formation\nTiming: 4 days\nThis step describes how to make blastoids using ESCs and TESCs.",
