    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCell culture (days 0–5)\nMurine iPSCs were maintained in DMEM culture medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum (FCS), 0.1 mmol/L nonessential amino acids, 1 mmol/L L-glutamine and 0.1 mmol/L β-mercaptoethanol. Monolayers of OP9-DL1/DL4 cells were cultured in α-MEM medium supplemented with 20% FCS and 2.2 g/L sodium bicarbonate.\nThe iPSCs were washed once in OP9-DL1/DL4 medium before plating onto sub-confluent OP9-DL1/DL4 monolayers for T lineage differentiation in the presence of murine recombinant Flt-3 ligand (mrFlt3L; 5 ng/mL) and murine IL-7 (mIL-7;1 ng/mL).\nGeneration of HBV viral Ag-specific iPSC-CTLs (days 0–28)\nMouse iPSCs (iPS-MEF-Ng-20D-17, GFP+) (Yu et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) were transduced with the MIDR retroviral construct encoding a human-mouse hybrid HBV TCR gene (HBs183-191-specific—s183; TCR Vα34 and Vβ28) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A), or OVA257–264 TCR (MiDR-OVA TCR) (Gehring et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/367-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. How to generate HBV viral Ag-specific iPSC-CTLs\nTransduce mouse iPSCs with the following retroviral constructs: HBs183-91 TCR (MiDR-HBV s183 TCR) or OVA257–264 TCR (MiDR-OVA TCR), and co-culture the transduced iPSCs with OP9-DL1/DL4 stromal cells for T lineage differentiation.\n(A) Present the schematic representation of the retrovirus constructs expressing HBV s183 TCR. Ψ, packaging signal; 2A, picornavirus self-cleaving 2A sequence; LTR, long terminal repeats.\n(B) Visualize the HBV TCR-transduced iPSCs by a fluorescence microscope.\n(C) Transduce GFP+ iPSCs (left and middle, no transduction) with the retroviral construct MiDR or MiDR with HBV s183 TCR, and analyze and sort the GFP+ DsRed+ iPSCs by flow cytometry (right) and by a high-speed cell sorter.\n(D) Analyze HBV s183 TCR for Vβ28 gene expression by PCR.\n(E) Show morphology of T cell differentiation on various days.",
    "(F) Show flow cytometric analysis of the iPSC-derived cells on day 28, gating on CD3+CD8+ cells, and analyze for the expression of CD8 and TCRVβ28. Data shown are representative of three individual experiments.\nPlatinum-E (Plat-E) packaging cell line is used to generate a pseudovirus for following retroviral transduction.\nSeed 3 × 106 Plat-E cells into a 100 mm culture dish containing 10 mL of RPMI complete media with FBS and penicillin/streptomycin 1 day prior to plasmid transfection.\nOn day 0, transfect Plat-E cells with HBV TCR-MiDR retroviral vector by using GeneJammer transfection reagent.\nOn day 1, take 2 mL of 0.1% Gelatin on to the well of the plate. Keep them in incubator at least for 30 min. After 30 min, remove gelatin from the plate by pipetting. Seed 1 × 106 iPSCs into one well of a 0.1% gelatin-coated 24-well plate containing 2 mL of DMEM media with 15% FBS.\nOn day 2, collect pseudovirus-containing supernatant from transfected Plat-E culture and pass the supernatant through a 0.4 μm filter to exclude potential debris and contaminants.\nPerform retroviral transduction in a centrifuge at 500 × g for 1 h in the presence of 5 μg/mL polybrene at 32°C. Use the fresh virus-containing supernatant to get the highest transduction efficiency.\nAfter transduction, place cells in a 32°C, 5% CO2 incubation overnight (14–16 h).\nOn day 3, repeat the second transduction as described above. Meanwhile, pre-coat a 6-well plate with irSNL76/7 feeder cells with α-MEM media at 37˚C for future use.\nOn day 4, collect transduced iPSCs by trypsinization, centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min, and seed into the 6-well plate pre-coated with irSNL76/7 feeder cells with DMEM media supplemented with 15% FBS at 37˚C.",
    "At confluence, collect cells by trypsinization, centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min, and process for cell sorting. GFP and DsRED double positive cells will be sorted by a 17-color BD FACS Aria SORP cell sorter. Culture sorted cells (HBV-iPSCs) on fresh irSNL76/7 feeder cells for future use.\nOP9-DL4 and OP9-DL1/DL4 cell lines are generated as described above but by using DL4-MiG and DL1/DL4-MiG constructs, respectively. Transduced cells are sorted by the FACSAria SORP based on GFP expression.\nGene-transduced iPSCs were co-cultured with OP9-DL1/DL4 cells expressing Notch ligands (both DL1 and DL4) molecules in the presence of rFlt3L and rIL-7.\nOn day 0, seed 5 × 104 HBV TCR gene-transduced iPSCs into a 100 mm culture dish coated with a confluent monolayer of OP9 (or other OP9-related cell lines) cells in 20% FBS in α-MEM medium at 37˚C.\nOn day 3, change culture medium.\nOn day 5, collect cells by trypsinization and centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min before incubating with α-MEM medium on a fresh 100 mm culture dish for 30 min in a 37°C incubator to exclude feeding cells.\nCollect and count floating cells, and transfer 5 × 105 cells to a fresh culture dish containing a confluent monolayer of feeding cells in 20% FBS α-MEM medium. Add the cytokine mFlt-3L (final concentration: 5 ng/mL) into the culture at 37˚C.\nOn day 8, gently pipette down loosely attached cells and then wash the feeding layer with 10 mL of PBS to get the maximal recovery of partially differentiated HBV-iPSCs.\nAfter harvesting cells from the co-culture, centrifuge cells at 400 × g for 5 min and resuspend them in 20 mL of 20% FBS α-MEM medium supplemented with mFlt-3L (5 ng/mL) and IL-7 (1 ng/mL).",
    "Transfer cells into a 6-well culture plate coated with confluent OP9-feeder cells. Usually HBV TCR-iPSCs recovered from one 100 mm culture dish will be transferred into one well of a 6-well plate.\nFrom day 10, change medium every other day (20% FBS α-MEM medium supplemented with 5 ng/mL mFlt-3L and 1 ng/mL IL-7).\nReplace OP9 feeder cell plates every 4–6 days depending on the growth of the feeder cells.\nVisualization of the DsRed expression upon gene transduction by fluorescence microscopy (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) and sorted GFP+DsRed+ cells (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nConfirmation of HBV TCR insertion into the transduced cells by PCR amplification (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D) and gene sequencing.\nAfter 7 days of culture with the OP9-DL1/DL4 cells, iPSCs differentiated into mesoderm-like cells and showed characteristic, non-adherent grape-like cluster morphology on day 14. On day 22, lymphocyte-like cells spread fully on the culture plates (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nOn day 28 of in vitro co-culture, the iPSC-derived cells substantially expressed CD3 and Ag-specific TCR, the T cell markers.\nFlow cytometric analysis of CD3+CD8+ populations showed that the HBV s183 but no OVA TCR transduction dramatically increased the generation of HBV-specific CD8+ T cells (CD8+ TCRVβ28+; Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nFunctional assessment of HBV viral Ag-specific iPSC-CTLs (days 28–30)\nOn day 28 of in vitro co-culture, CD4−CD8+ single-positive (SP) iPSC-CTLs were isolated and stimulated them by T-depleted splenocytes pulsed with s183 peptide for indicated time period and assessed cytokine production.\nThe iPSC-CTLs produced large amounts of IL-2 and IFN-γ, as detected by intracellular staining (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) or ELISA (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) according to the manufacturer instruction and displayed Ag-specific cytotoxicity (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C), which were similar as HBV TCR gene-transduced CTLs.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/367-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Perform functional analysis of HBV viral Ag-specific iPSC-CTLs",
    "On day 28 of in vitro co-culture, sort the SP CD8+s183 TCR pentamer+ iPSC-T cells. Stimulate the iPSC-T cells and CD8+ T cells transduced with MiDR-s183 TCR with s183 peptide (FLLTRILTI)-pulsed T-depleted splenocytes (APCs) from HHD mice.\n(A) Show intracellular staining of IL-2 and IFN-γ after 7 h (gated on CD8+ cells) (T/APCs = 1:4).\n(B) Present ELISA of IL-2 and IFN-γ after 40 h.\n(C) Measure T cell cytotoxicity after co-culture for 6 h using the 7-AAD/CFSE cell-mediated cytotoxicity assay kit. Data shown are representative of three individual experiments.\nDevelopment of HBV replication in mice (weeks 1–8)\nHLA-A2.1 transgenic (HHD) mice were infected with HBV by hydrodynamic injection of 10 mg of pAAV/HBV1.2 DNA plasmid through the tail veins of mice.\nTotal HBV DNA was resuspended in 1 mL of PBS and delivered into the liver within 3 s. For each animal, 10 μg of pAAV/HBV 1.2 DNA dissolved in 8% body weight of PBS was injected. Before the injection, all animals were anesthetized using isoflurane administered by isoflurane vaporizer. Briefly, anesthetized mice were positioned, so one of the lateral veins are visible. Viral DNA was re suspended in 1 mL of PBS and loaded in 3 ML of sterile syringe with a sterile 27 gauze needle. Position the syringe parallel to the tail with the needle pointing toward the body of the mouse and the bevel of the needle facing up. Proceed with the injection only if the needle is correctly inserted, which is evident from the needle sliding in with no resistance. Press down on plunger in one, continuous motion and inject the full volume of liquid within 3–7 s.",
    "Serum level of HBsAg were monitored regularly from the serum of retroorbital blood. The serum was collected from the infected mice on different period of time, serum RNA was collected, and then proceeded for mRNA expression to measure the viral concentration.\nDNA was isolated from the blood and 100 ng of DNA was used to detect HBV DNA replication using real-time PCR (RT-PCR) followed the manufacturer protocol.\nHBV replication were detected in the serum of HHD mice (C57BL/6 background; Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) from day 3 to 35. DNA replication peaked on day 7 and then reduced gradually. HBV DNA was not cleared from the serum until day 35.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/367-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Induce HBV replication in HHD mice by hydrodynamic injection\nPerform hydrodynamic tail vein injection of HBV plasmid on HHD mice by injecting 10 μg of plasmid in 8% body weight of PBS.\n(A) Show serum HBV copies.

On indicated time points after injection, isolate the serum from the blood and determine protein expression by ELISA.\n(E) Present liver tissue histology. Euthanize mice on day 8 after HBV infection. Isolate and stain liver samples for histologic examination.\n(F) Show quantitation of HBs Ag+ cells on various days. Data shown are representative of three individual experiments (n = 5).\nWe also examined HBs Ag (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B), HBe Ag (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D) from the serum by ELISA on various days. Similar to DNA replication, HBs Ag peaked on day 7 and then dropped slowly.",
    "Intra-hepatic viral DNA transcription and replication were detected from the liver. Mice were sacrificed at different days of post infection, and their livers were isolated and prepared for HBV surface protein staining. In the early period post infection, expression of HBV surface protein was high (approximately 40% of all liver cells are HBs Ag+) and correlates with DNA replication data (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E and 3F). During the whole period, we detected HBV protein expression following hydrodynamic injection, although the protein expression was lower than that in the initial period.\nInflammatory cell infiltration was detected in the liver after viral infection. Liver samples were processed with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining to detect the inflammatory cells. We observed the robust infiltration of inflammatory cells into the liver in the early period followed by gradually reduction (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E, lower panel).\nDetection of accumulated HBV viral Ag-specific iPSC-CTLs in the liver\nTo exert the cytotoxic effects, HBV viral Ag-specific iPSC-CTLs need to accumulate in the liver in which viral replication initiates and expands, and this requires Ag specificity (Tang et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nTo accurately express human HBV TCR on mouse iPSCs, we used murine-human hybrid TCR in which the original human constant region was replaced by that of mouse. Also, for the potential recognition of human TCR in mice, we used HHD mice that express human HLA-A2.1 but lack murine major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules.",
    "Following the hydrodynamic injection of pAAV/HBV1.2 DNA plasmid and adoptive cell transfer of 2 x 106 Ag-specific iPSC-CTLs after 1 week of DNA injection, we used flow cytometry to analyze the expression of HBV-specific TCR on CD8+ T cells. In the spleens and livers of mice receiving HBV-specific iPSC-CTLs, CD8+ T cells expressing HBV- specific TCR were clearly visualized (3.06/11.87 = 25.8% and 1.74/4.5 = 38.7% of CD8+ populations, respectively) but was barely detected in those mice receiving the control cells, i.e., OVA-specific iPSC-CTLs (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). Using immunofluorescence staining, we further visualized HBV-specific TCR expression on CD8+T cells in the livers but did not detect its expression on those of mice receiving OVA-specific iPSC- CTLs (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/367-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Show accumulation of HBV viral Ag-specific iPSC-CTLs in the liver with HBV replication\nEuthanize mice at day 8 after the adoptive transfer of T cells. Harvest the spleens or livers and isolate the intra-hepatic lymphocytes by enzymatic digestion.\n(A) Analyze accumulation of HBV-specific T cells by flow cytometry. Make single cell suspension from the intra-hepatic lymphocytes and stain cells with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies. Gate on CD8+ T cells to analyze HBV-specific TCR.\n(B) Show immunohistochemistry. Stain liver slides with both fluorochrome-conjugated CD8 antibody and s183 TCR pentamer, and examine under a fluorescent microscope. Green color indicates CD8 and red color indicates HBV-specific TCR. Data are representative of five mice per group of three independent experiments."
