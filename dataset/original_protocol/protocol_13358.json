    "The research was performed in compliance with institutional guidelines at the beginning of the protocol section. All protocols and procedures were carried out according to the Declaration of Helsinki and were reviewed and approved by the Chang Gung Medical Foundation Institutional Review Board. All volunteers were informed of the nature of this study and signed an informed consent form prior to their inclusion. The consumables required for the entire experimental procedure are presented in Figure 1 and Figure 2, as well as in the Table of Materials.\n1. Preparation of the materials needed to produce mACS eye drops\nPrepare 250 mL of 10% glycerol solution and keep a 21 G butterfly-winged infusion set, a 3 mL syringe without the needle, and six 10 mL vacutainer tubes containing heparin 158 USP units ready (Figure 1).\nConnect the 21 G blood collection needle to the 3 mL syringe and withdraw 3 mL of 10% glycerol solution into the prepared syringe.\n\tNOTE: All materials must be sterilized before the needle is inserted.\nDistribute the 10% glycerol solution into the vacutainer tubes in sequence, with approximately 0.5 mL of 10% glycerol solution in each (Figure 3A).\n\t​NOTE: Because of the negative pressure in the test tube, the needle must come out immediately after it goes in to evenly distribute 3 mL of glycerol solution to the six test tubes.\nSterilize the patient's skin with 75% alcohol sterile cotton swabs. Puncture the superficial vein of the patient's upper limbs with the 18 G blood collection needle. Draw 60-70 mL of venous blood from the superficial vein in total.\n2. Preparation for mACS eye drops\nSequentially inject 10 mL of the drawn venous blood into each of the six vacutainer tubes (Figure 3B).",
    "NOTE: This step relies on the negative pressure of the vacuum to fill the tubes. To avoid blood cell disruption and hemolysis, do not apply any positive pressure.\nPlace the six vacutainer tubes in the incubator with a constant temperature of 37 °C for 4 h (Figure 3C).\n\tNOTE: The hypoxic status is maintained and stabilized by the remaining negative pressure in a sealed tube that received glycerol.\nRemove the tubes from the incubator after 4 h and centrifuge them at 3,500 × g for 10 min at room temperature.\nAt this point, prepare the materials for mACS extraction, including the sterilized eye drop bottles, a 3 mL syringe with the needle, a 0.22 µm filter, an 18 G needle, and a pair of sterile gloves (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: The operating table should be wiped with 75% alcohol to ensure an aseptic environment. The supernatant, after centrifugation, is already a semi-finished product of mACS.\nPlace the six tubes on the tube rack and open the caps after complete centrifugation (Figure 3D).\n\tNOTE: Sterility is not required in this step.\nPut on sterile gloves and draw out the mACS one by one using a 3 mL syringe with an 18 G needle.\n\tNOTE: Be careful not to draw the lower blood cell layer during this step (Figure 3E).\nPull out the needle, connect it to the 0.22 µm filter, and connect the 23 G, 1.5 in blood collection needle with the original 3 mL syringe to the outlet below (Figure 3F).\nPush the needle gently through the 0.22 µm filter into the prepared sterile eye drop bottles (Figure 3G).\nRepeat the above steps until all the mACS has been filtered and stored in eye drop bottles (Figure 3H).",
    "Store the mACS eye drops at 4 °C for immediate use; store at -20 °C for long-term preservation.\n\t​NOTE: Do not keep them for more than 2 weeks at 4 °C or for longer than 3 months at -20 °C9,19.\n3. Ex vivo wound healing model of murine corneal epithelium\nNOTE: The following ex vivo animal model was based on prior experience from Hung et al. on mechanical injuries of the corneal epithelium20. The following steps should be performed under the microscope to create a well-circumscribed and consistent corneal epithelial wound.\nAnesthetize the C57BL/6 mice with 3%-4% isoflurane. Indent the skin biopsy punch over the murine central cornea, leaving a shallow circle on the epithelium as a uniform wound margin.\n\tNOTE: Be gentle to avoid eyeball rupture.\nDebride the corneal epithelium within the confirmed area down to the Bowman's layer, with a corneal rust ring remover equipped with a 0.5 mm burr.\nTo establish the ex vivo animal model of the mechanical corneal wound, harvest the eyeball and prepare the culture well.\n\t\nEuthanize the mice first; then, gently press the superior and inferior orbital rims of the mice, introduce the tip of the forceps over the retrobulbar space, and out the eyeball and hold it by the forceps.\nCut the optic nerve and periorbital soft tissue with corneal scissors to isolate the eyeball perfectly.\nPrepare a 96-well plate with melted wax inside it. Quickly create a round hole using the tips of forceps and then wait for solidification.\nPrepare the media to be tested: 0.5% mACS, 0.5% AS for comparison, normal saline as a negative control, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM).\n\tNOTE: mACS is obtained using the protocol mentioned above.",
    "For the ex vivo culture, place the harvested eyeball onto the prepared 96-well plate. Add 200 µL of each medium into the 96-well plate.\nPlace the 96-well culture plate into the incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Ensure that the culture media is changed every 24 h.\nTo confirm the sequential wound healing effect, monitor the epithelial wound area under the microscope every 8 h by fluorescein staining.\n\t\nDissolve the fluorescein on the fluorescein paper with normal saline.\nDrop the fluorescein dye onto the murine central cornea, then observe and document it under a microscope. A typical result is shown in Figure 4.\n\t\tNOTE: One drop (approximately 0.05 mL) of fluorescein dye is enough for the observation.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
