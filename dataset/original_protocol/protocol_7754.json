    "Day 1Seed the appropriate number of cells (see Note 2) on top of glass coverslips placed (one per well) in 24-well cell culture dishes. Alternatively, if it is required to transfect cells prior to performing the endocytosis assay, seed cells on top of 5-6 coverslips placed in each well of 6-well culture dishes. You should prepare at least one independent multi-well dish per each time point in your experiment, plus two for controls (e.g. four dishes for an experiment with control cells plus two different times of endocytosis). Day 2 (optional)Cell DNA-transfection with Lipofectamine2000, according to manufacturer’s protocol. On the day of the endocytosis assay, transfer the coverslips with cells into 24-well cell culture dishes. Transfection could be needed when you need to modulate proteins putatively involved in the internalization of the receptor.Day 3-4Endocytosis assay (or Day 2-3, if no cell transfection needed prior to the assay), by the following steps (see Figure 1 for the protocol scheme).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20130729/20130729021134_8781.jpgFigure 1. Schematic representation of experimental flowRemove cell culture medium and incubate cells with 400-500 μl of serum-free DMEM medium containing 0.3% BSA for at least 1 h (extendable up to 3 h) at 37 °C in cell culture incubator, in order to deprive cells of serum-contained stimuli.Replace cell medium with the appropriate dilution of the fluorescent ligand EGF (2 ng/ml) into 400 μl of DMEM 0.3% BSA (per well).Incubate the cells on ice for 1 h, in the dark (by covering the dish with aluminium foil).Wash two multi-well dishes with ice-cold PBS three times and leave them on ice (control condition = ligand binding without endocytosis, at 4 °C binding ligand receptor is allowed, while internalization is blocked).",
    "On one of the two dishes above, perform an acidic wash (to remove non-internalized ligand) by incubating the cells with an acetic acid buffer on ice for 6 min. Rinse with ice-cold PBS three times and leave on ice.Transfer the other cell culture dishes at 37 °C to elicit endocytosis for different periods (optimal time points need to be set for the specific cellular model and ligand stimulation; in our experience, for example, 12 and 25 min for EGF 2 ng/ml to A549 cells).At the end of each incubation, block endocytosis by moving dishes on ice. Wash 3 times with ice-cold PBS and proceed with acid wash on ice as described in step 5 (to detach all the ligand bound to the receptor at the plasma membrane and allow detection of internalized ligand only).After acidic wash, rinse each well 3 times with cold PBS.Fix cells on every coverslip by incubation with 4% PFA in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and then wash 3 times with PBS. Fixed cells may be stored for several days in the refrigerator at this stage.Permeabilize cell membranes by incubating fixed cells on coverslips with a solution of 0.01% saponin in PBS 1% BSA for 5-10 min on ice (in alternative, you may use 0.1% Triton in PBS 1% BSA).Wash permeabilized cells three times with PBS.(Optional) If Immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) is planned, non-specific binding may be blocked by incubation with PBS 1% BSA for 30 min, followed by immunostaining with specific antibodies.Counterstain cell nuclei by incubating with DAPI 5 min at room temperature (a dilution 1:10,000 of a stock of 1 μg/μl).Finally, wash once coverslips in PBS, then rinse with water and fix them inverted on microscope glass slides by including a mounting medium.",
    "Analysis of fluorescent signals should be done with a confocal microscope with a 63x magnification, such as Leica TCS SP2 AOBS confocal laser-scanning microscope (see Figure 2 for representative images).Quantify endocytosed fluorescent signal acquired with ImageJ software.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20130805/20130805095421_9959.jpgFigure 2. Representative pictures of endocytosis assay on A549. On the left, control cells treated with fluorescent EGF 1 h at 4 °C and subjected to acidic wash to clear out all EGF bound to plasmamembrane; no fluorescent signal from the plasmamembrane. On the right, cells treated with fluorescent EGF 1 h at 4 °C, subjected to acidic wash and then shifted to 37 °C (internalization); fluorescent signal from internalized EGF."
