    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAnimal preparation: Fur removal\nTiming: 5–10 min per mouse, 24 h prior to injection\nDuring this step, perform fur removal to prepare the animals for injection under ultrasound guidance.\nNote: Fur removal is performed at least 24 h prior to injection to minimize cumulative time under general anesthesia. If fur removal is performed too far in advance (more than 72 h), fur can grow back and interfere with image acquisition.\nPrepare Depilatory Station.\nTurn on the heated platform and set to 37°C.\nEnsure that there is sufficient isoflurane and oxygen to carry out the procedure.\nNote: For the development of this protocol, 5% isoflurane in oxygen (5 liters per minute) was used for anesthesia induction and 2.5% isoflurane in oxygen (5 liters per minute) was used for anesthesia maintenance. Prior to starting the procedure, the anesthetic chamber was topped off with isoflurane.\nReview tubing connections between the anesthetic chamber and anesthetic delivery cone to ensure there are no leaks and that stopcocks are in the closed position (perpendicular to tubing).\nNote: Any previously approved anesthesia induction chamber and nose cone used for diagnostic imaging will work for this application. The purpose of this step is to minimize unnecessary exposure to isoflurane.\nPlace an absorbent blue pad on the heated platform and assemble tools:\nElectric shaver.\nUnscented depilatory cream.\nPBS.\nMetal spatula.\nKimwipes.\nCotton-tipped applicators.\nInduce Anesthesia.\nTransfer one mouse at a time to the anesthesia chamber and induce general anesthesia as per local animal review committee protocol.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to both eyes for anesthetic events lasting longer than 5 min.\nTransfer anesthetized mouse to the preheated platform draped with an absorbent pad and continue anesthesia administration via nose cone.",
    "Optional: If an assistant is present to monitor mice under anesthesia, place the next mouse into the induction chamber.\nRemove Fur.\nUsing an electric shaver, remove fur from the anterior abdomen (from the costal margin to the mid abdomen).\nDispense a dime-sized amount of unscented depilatory cream and spread evenly over the shaved area using a cotton-tipped applicator.\nWait for approximately 2 min.\nUsing a metal spatula, gently remove cream and fur until skin is completely fur-free.\nNote: Even fine hair patches produce sufficient artifact to prevent visualization of anatomic structures. Complete fur removal with depilatory cream is required for crisp, artifact-free imaging. Shaving removes most of the fur and makes the second step of fur removal with depilatory cream more efficient.\nUsing a lightly moistened Kimwipe, remove excess depilatory cream.\nPat the mouse skin dry with a dry Kimwipe.\nTransfer the mouse back to the cage on a heated platform and monitor for recovery from anesthesia.\nRepeat above steps until all mice have undergone hair removal and have recovered from anesthesia.\nUltrasound imaging and injection station preparation\nTiming: 30 min\nDuring this step, prepare the imaging and injection station and check the experimental equipment prior to use.\nReview tubing connections between the anesthetic chamber and anesthetic delivery cone.\nEnsure that there is sufficient isoflurane and oxygen in the anesthesia induction chamber to carry out the procedure.\nNote: For the development of this protocol, 5% isoflurane in oxygen was used for anesthesia induction and 2.5% isoflurane in oxygen was used for anesthesia maintenance.\nTurn on the physiological controller from the Vevo® Imaging Station and set the platform temperature to 37°C.\nCritical: The mice have previously undergone hair removal and are particularly susceptible to hypothermia. If the platform is not well heated, mice can die from hypothermia.",
    "Place ultrasound gel bottle on the heated platform to warm ultrasound gel prior to the procedure to lessen the risk of hypothermia for the mice.\nAssemble required instruments.\nPlace an absorbent pad under the Vevo® Imaging Station.\nPlace toothed forceps, 31-gauge insulin syringes, cotton-tipped applicators, and alcohol wipes on the absorbent pad.\nSelect and mount the linear high frequency probe on the imaging station (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2535-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Example of properly set up ultrasound imaging and injection station with mouse secured to platform\nNote: All ultrasound machines have the capability of using multiple probe types (curvilinear, cardiac, linear, etc.). However, probe compatibility is dependent upon the manufacturer. A compatible MicroScan™ Transducer was used in this protocol, but another high frequency linear probe may work for this application. The procedure for switching between probes will be machine dependent.\nOrient the probe indicator toward the mouse’s left side (facing the injector).\nNote: This setup allows the injector to see the needle enter on the lefthand side of the screen.\nFor optimal ergonomics, position the imaging station and ultrasound screen so that the operator does not have adjust their head or body to see the screen (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).",
    "Critical: Ergonomics and positioning of the ultrasound screen are essential for successful ultrasound-guided procedures. The operator should not need to adjust their body position to see the screen during the procedure. Optimal positioning will be dependent on the height of the injector. Table height and positioning of the ultrasound screen relative to the injection table should be adjusted for each individual injector to minimize unnecessary movement. In other words, everything should be positioned so that once the injector has pierced the skin with the needle at the intended injection site, they only need to lift their gaze—without rotating their body or head—to see the ultrasound screen. The injector should not need to look away from the screen after that point to complete the procedure. For a sample set up, see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nCell preparation for injection\nTiming: 1 h\nDuring this step, prepare tumor cells for injection.\nSuspend the attached cells using preferred detachment protocol. Count the cells.\nNote: The B16F10-luc cells and HPAC-luc cells used in this protocol were detached from the plate using 0.25% trypsin.\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 450 × g for 5 min at 4°C to minimize cell death during processing. Remove supernatant.\nResuspend cells in chilled PBS to wash the cells.\nRepeat centrifugation and PBS wash (steps 2 and 3) twice for a total of 3 PBS washes.\nNote: Repeated washing of cells with PBS removes the FBS present in culture media prior to injection.\nResuspend cells in chilled PBS to the desired cell concentration. Keep cells on ice to maximize cell viability. Recommended injection volume is 30 μL per mouse.",
    "Note: It is recommended to titrate the number of tumor cells injected for each individual cell line used as the optimal time to development of metastatic lesions may differ between cell lines. The B16F10-luc cells used in this protocol were injected at a concentration of 8–10 × 105 cells/mL (2.5 × 104 cells in 30 μL). The HPAC-luc cells used in this protocol were injected at a concentration of 3–4 × 107 cells/mL (1 × 106 cells in 30 μL).\nUltrasound-guided injection\nTiming: 10–15 min per mouse\nDuring this step, inject tumor cells into the portal vein at its confluence with the splenic vein (the point where the two blood vessels meet).\nAnesthetize mice.\nAnesthetize one mouse at a time in the anesthesia induction chamber as per local animal review committee protocol.\nNote: For the development of this protocol, 5% isoflurane in oxygen (5 liters per minute) was used for anesthesia induction and 2.5% isoflurane in oxygen (5 liters per minute) was used for anesthesia maintenance. Prior to starting the procedure, the anesthetic chamber was topped off with isoflurane.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to both eyes for anesthetic events lasting longer than 5 min.\nTransfer mouse to pre-heated animal imaging platform and maintain anesthesia via nose cone.\nSecure mouse to platform using paper tape (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nNote: Each paw should be secured to the platform using a short piece of paper tape (approximately 2.5 cm). The electrocardiogram (ECG) pads can be used as a landmark, but it is not necessary to align them to the pads as the heart rate monitoring function will not be utilized.\nOptional: secure needle stabilization device to the ultrasound probe with the syringe-holding side facing the user (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nSanitize the ultrasound probe with an alcohol wipe or 70% ethanol spray.",
    "Wipe the previously shaved abdominal area of the mouse with an alcohol swab.\nApply a generous layer of pre-warmed ultrasound gel to the mouse.\nLower the probe using the height control until it meets the ultrasound gel layer. Watch the ultrasound screen for the ultrasound image to come into view.\nUsing the fine forward and backward control knobs, scan the mouse and use anatomic landmarks to identify the spleen, pancreas, and left kidney (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2535-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Relevant anatomic landmarks with labels\nScan the pancreas until you identify a blood vessel running through the pancreas. Confirm that this is the splenic vein by tracing the entirety of the vein, ensuring that it travels from the spleen all the way to the portal vein.\nNote: Identification of structures on ultrasound relies on the relationship between structures. For example, the left renal vein can easily be mistaken for the splenic vein if a static image is used to identify structures. Tracing the vessel will show that it emerges from the kidney and drains into the inferior vena cava. The splenic vein on the other hand, emerges from the spleen and runs through the pancreatic tissue, ultimately joining the portal vein. The portal vein can be followed cranially until it is seen entering the liver.\nWhile the injector identifies the relevant landmarks, an assistant should prepare the cells for injection by loading 30 μL of cells into the 31-gauge insulin syringe.\nCritical: It is essential to degas the needle thoroughly as even small amounts of air can prove lethal for the mouse.\nTrace the splenic vein until reaching the confluence with the portal vein. Adjust your window (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]) using the forward and backward control knobs and the ultrasound depth settings.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2535-Fig4.jpg",
    "Figure 4. Ideal window configuration at the confluence of the splenic and portal veins\nNote: Adjust the gain by ensuring expected dark regions appear black on the ultrasound screen (blood and fluid should appear darker). Adjust the gain until blood within vessels is black. Similarly, adjust the depth to fill 75% of the screen with the object of interest (the confluence of the splenic and portal veins). This maximizes the quality and crispness of the image.\nOptional: If using the stabilization device, snap the loaded syringe into place and adjust the angle of entry so that the needle tip is positioned over the target. Depending on how thick the gel layer is and how much probe pressure is applied, the probe may need to be raised using the height control to secure the needle to the device. With sufficient space, the needle can be brought into position under the probe. Then, the probe and secured needle can be lowered together into a thick cap of gel. This way, the entire length of the needle can be visualized simultaneously with the target blood vessel. Leaving insufficient space between the probe and the skin risks bending the delicate needle when attempting to position the needle.\nUsing freehand technique, position the needle within the gel cap until it is perfectly in plane. An artifact from the needle should be visible (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] and 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2535-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Appearance of needle relative to anatomic landmarks when positioned within gel layer using freehand, in plane technique\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2535-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Side-by-side comparison of needle set up and positioning for the freehand and stabilization device techniques\nAdjust the angle of entry to between 30° and 45° before advancing the needle.\nEnsure that the needle is perfectly in plane with the ultrasound probe before proceeding.",
    "Critical: In plane technique is the most important part of this procedure. The needle must be in plane to visualize its full length. Failure to advance the needle using in plane technique can cause the injector to advance the needle through the vessel, resulting in misinjection and/or vessel injury (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2535-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Schematic representation of in plane technique demonstrating appearance of needle relative to probe and corresponding image on the ultrasound screen\nUsing toothed forceps, grasp the skin lateral to the intended site of needle entry and gently pull the skin taut.\nNote: Creating tension allows the injector to advance the needle easily through the skin and muscle layers using their dominant hand. Once the needle is positioned at the skin and the forceps are stably grasping the skin taut, the injector should primarily look at the ultrasound screen for the remainder of the procedure.\nGently advance the needle using the dominant hand.\nNote: The needle stabilization device restricts lateral movement, maintaining the needle in plane with forward advancement. If using freehand technique, use fine adjustments to visualize the full needle length. The needle should not be advanced if it moves out of plane or if visualization is poor. When the needle is advanced in plane toward the desired target, the full length of the needle can always be seen and sequentially advanced (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2535-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Schematic representation of appearance on ultrasound screen of needle advancing through tissue over time when using in plane technique\nOnce through the skin and muscle layers, release the skin and drop the toothed forceps.\nSlowly advance the needle through the pancreatic tissue (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]: Demonstration of needle advancement through subcutaneous and pancreatic tissue).",
    "Note: The pancreatic tissue can be difficult to penetrate. If too much pressure is applied, the needle can advance suddenly and travel farther than anticipated. If the needle is in plane with the ultrasound probe, the injector will directly observe the needle rapidly advance and simultaneously detect a loss of tissue resistance. Steady, gentle pressure permits controlled advancement of the needle through the tissue.\nConfirm needle position by gently poking the vein.\nNote: If the needle is over the vein, pressure from the needle will cause the vessel to collapse inward (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]: Demonstration of steady downward pressure applied to pancreatic tissue. Note that pressure from needle can collapse vessel). Ideally, the splenic vein is entered just distal to where it joins the portal vein so that the needle tip ends up inside the portal vein (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]).\nApply gentle, steady pressure until the needle tip enters the vein. The tissue should visibly slide over the needle (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9] and Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]: Demonstration of pancreatic tissue “give” and controlled intravascular placement of needle tip).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2535-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. Intravascular placement of needle tip within portal vein\nNote artifact from in plane needle.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S1. Demonstration of needle advancement through subcutaneous and pancreatic tissue, related to step 33\n    \nNote: Trauma to the vessel is immediately apparent. If the vein is rapidly entered and the needle goes through the posterior wall of the vessel, extravasation of blood will occur. Even minor shearing with minimal extravasation will be visible. If this occurs, pause the procedure (troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 2: Difficulty in maintaining the needle in plane).\nConfirm intravascular placement by carefully bouncing the needle tip up and down within the vessel.",
    "Note: If the needle is within the vessel, the tip should remain inside of the vessel (Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]: Demonstration of needle tip remaining within portal vein with bounce).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S2.

Demonstration of pancreatic tissue “give” and controlled intravascular placement of needle tip, related to step 35\n    \nWithout moving the syringe, aspirate and confirm brisk blood return in the syringe.\nSlowly inject the cells, ensuring that no air is injected.\nOptional: An assistant can place the next mouse into the anesthesia induction chamber.\nNote: Sometimes, the needle may appear to be within the vessel when there is actually a thin layer of tissue stuck on the needle. Avoid aspirating too vigorously, particularly when the needle is not within the vessel, to prevent introduction of air into the syringe. Intravascular air injection can prove fatal to the mouse. It may be helpful for an assistant to watch the syringe as cells are injected to ensure that no air bubbles have entered the syringe.\nAfter injection, apply additional probe pressure by adjusting the height control.\nSlowly retract the needle under ultrasound guidance.\nRelease the applied pressure and observe the area to ensure the vessel has not been damaged.",
    "Note: The appearance of the vessel should be unchanged with successful injection. If misinjection into the pancreatic tissue has occurred, it will be immediately apparent at the time of injection. For example, a black fluid bubble will form outside of the vessel or there will be an abnormal accumulation of black fluid along tissue planes. Acute hemorrhage and free fluid, such as from intraperitoneal injection of the cell suspension, is not distinguishable by ultrasound; all free fluid appears black. However, intrapancreatic injection is easily distinguished from both extrapancreatic injection and vascular injury (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 4: Extravascular injection for more detail). Blood vessel shearing and resultant extravasation of blood can be readily detected on the ultrasound screen and does not result in any observable changes at the skin injection site given the fine needle gauge and multiple layers of tissue between the skin injection site and target blood vessel.\nTransfer the mouse to a cage on a heated platform and monitor for recovery from anesthesia. Full recovery from anesthesia should be rapid and mice should not appear to be in pain.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S4. Demonstration of needle tip remaining within portal vein with bounce, related to step 36\n    \nBioluminescent imaging\nTiming: 5–10 min per cage\nDuration: Every 3 days until hepatic signal increases.\nDuring this step, perform surveillance bioluminescent imaging to detect and monitor tumor cell engraftment.\nNote: Time to initial bioluminescent signal varies by cell line and number of cells injected (see expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes] and limitations[href=https://www.wicell.org#limitations]). For the purposes of defining growth kinetics during model development, mice were imaged as frequently as every 3 days. Once the growth kinetics and survival time for a given model is defined, the imaging frequency can be adjusted.",
    "Anesthetize mice as per local animal review committee protocol.\nPerform 50 μL intraperitoneal injections of D-Luciferin (50 mg/kg).\nAcquire bioluminescent images at 5 min post-injection using the IVIS Lumina III imaging system.\nNote: For this protocol, we performed a four-image series with an FStop of 1.2 at 1, 5, 10, and 20 s. All images displayed in this protocol were from the first image (FStop 1 at 1 s) using a consistent color intensity scale across serial images ranging from a minimum of 1.00 × 106 to a maximum of 1.00 × 108.\nTransfer mice to a cage on a heated platform and monitor for recovery from anesthesia."
