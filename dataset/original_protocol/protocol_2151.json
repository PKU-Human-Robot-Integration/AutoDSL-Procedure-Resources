    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPrepare the sample for microscopy\nTiming: 4 days\nUsing the appropriate antibiotic concentration (see MIC assay), and following the correct treatment time (see biphasic killing curve), persister awakening kinetics can be assessed. Cells are treated with antibiotics and, following several washing steps, are spotted on the LB-agarose pad.\nDay 1: Inoculate your preculture in a glass tube containing 5 mL LB medium. Incubate at 37°C at 200 rpm for 20–24 h.\nDay 2: Dilute your preculture 100-fold in 5 mL LB medium. Incubate at 37°C at 200 rpm for 16–18 h.\nDay 3: Take 990 μL of the culture and add it to an empty, sterile, glass tube. Add 10 μL of the ofloxacin stock solution. This will result in an ofloxacin concentration of 5 μg/mL.\nOptional: Use another antibiotic of your choice, in a concentration calculated from the MIC assay and a treatment time determined from the biphasic killing curve. The duration of treatment depends on when the persister plateau is reached in the biphasic killing curve and should be assessed for every combination of antibiotic and bacterial strain.\nCritical: Avoid flaming the tube in this step, as the heat might affect the antibiotic efficacy. Work in a sterile environment to avoid contamination.\nIncubate the tube at 37°C at 200 rpm for 5 h.\nIn the meantime, prepare the LB agarose.\nPrepare the microscopy slide.\nRemove the protection layer from the gene frame and stick it to a glass microscopy slide (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1735-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Preparation of the LB-agarose pad\n(A) Stick the gene frame to a glass slide.\n(B) Fill the gene frame with LB-agarose.\n(C) Remove excess agarose by gently pressing the cover slip on the agarose.",
    "Take approximately 200 μL of the heated LB-agarose and slowly pipet it in the middle of the gene frame until the frame is completely filled (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). This is easier if you use a 1 mL pipet, as the tip opening is larger.\nAdd heated LB-agarose until your gene frame is filled.\nNote: The gene frames used here have a capacity of 25 μL.\nTake a glass cover slip and gently press it on the gene frame (without removing the protective layer of the gene frame), thereby flattening the LB-agarose (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nLet it dry for 2–5 h at room temperature.\nNote: If the LB-agarose pad has not dried completely, it will shrink during your time-lapse experiment which can cause XY drift or losing of focus in the Z direction.\nMake sure the microscope incubation chamber is at its correct temperature (37°C).\nFollowing 5 h treatment with ofloxacin, pipet 100 μL of your sample in an Eppendorf tube.\nCentrifuge the cells at 3,000 × g for 5 min.\nResuspend the pellet in 100 μL of pre-heated LB.\nRepeat the washing step.\nDuring the last washing step, prepare your LB-agarose pad.\nGently remove the cover slip on top of the agarose by sliding.\nTake a scalpel and go over the inner border of the gene frame. This will prevent the agarose pad to be damaged when you remove the protective layer from the sticky blue border of the gene frame.\nAdd 2 μL of the washed culture in the middle of your LB-agarose pad.\nGently tap the side of the slide against the bench, spreading the culture.\nLet it dry for a couple of minutes.\nNote: The liquid should be completely evaporated.\nRemove the protective layer from the sticky blue border of the gene frame.",
    "Put a glass cover slip on top of the gene frame.\nGently press it.\nNote down the time.\nStart the time lapse\nTiming: 20 min for setting up the microscope\nFollowing sample preparation, cells are imaged to follow their recovery and determine their awakening kinetics. It is important that this imaging is initiated as soon as possible.\nVisualize the sample using a 100× magnification (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).\nChoose several different XY positions throughout the sample. Spread your positions well. Take 5–8 positions close to each other, then move further across your sample. Spreading has several advantages. E.g., if an air bubble in your immersion oil disrupts focus, it is likely that not all of your positions are affected.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1735-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Choosing your XY positions\n(A) This position is too crowded.\n(B) Avoid imaging in the near proximity of a big “wall” of cells.\n(C and D) Examples of ideal XY positions.\nNote: The number of cells in the frame is important. Avoid positions with too many cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). It will complicate data analysis.\nNote: Avoid positions that are right next to a big “wall” of cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nNote: Ideally, take a combination of frames that contain a different number of cells. Examples are depicted in Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C and 3D.\nThe number of XY positions to select depends on your persister fraction, which is related the probability of observing a persister cell.\nFor E. coli BW25113 in stationary phase following ofloxacin treatment, 25 XY positions usually suffice.\nNote: If this fraction is approximately 1% you will need somewhere around 25 different XY positions. If it is higher (e.g., 10%), 15 frames might be sufficient. However, optimization might be necessary here.",
    "Critical: Keep in mind that the number of XY positions is limited. The limitation depends on the time interval between time points and speed of your microscope. The interval between the different time points should be 15–20 min, which cannot be reached if there are too many positions.\nChoose an interval of 15 min for a total duration of 18 h (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]).\nNote: The total duration of the experiment depends on the chosen strain and antibiotic. As a rule of thumb, 18 h is often sufficient for E. coli strains.\nNote down the time. The time between step 13 and in step 9 should be taken into account during the data analysis.\nOptional: If the persister fraction is high enough, you can increase throughput by combining two experiments on the same agarose pad. Therefore, carefully divide the agarose pad in two using a scalpel. This division line will be visible under the microscope. Make sure your cultures are well-separated and take XY positions far from the division line, to make sure you are visualizing the correct strain.\nNote: The antibiotic concentration used might influence awakening kinetics. Note that this concentration should always be above the MIC.\nAnalyze the data\nTiming: 1 day\nFollowing ofloxacin treatment, strong filamentation is observed in both sensitive cells and persister cells during recovery, resulting from the induction of the SOS response due to double-strand break formation (Goormaghtigh and Van Melderen, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Murawski and Brynildsen, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Wilmaerts et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Some of these filamented sensitive cells will even undergo cell division. However, a sensitive cell will not form viable offspring, whereas a persister cell will create so-called micro-colonies, as shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]. Following the identification of the persister cells, awakening parameters can be determined.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1735-Fig4.jpg",
    "Figure 4. Representative example of recovering BW25113 following ofloxacin treatment\nThe red arrow indicates the persister cell, all the other cells are antibiotic-sensitive. The cell division plane is indicated with a red circle. The persister cell undergoes multiple cell divisions, leading to the formation of a micro-colony, in contrast to the sensitive cells.\nTake into account the time between putting the cells on agarose (step 9) and the time the time-lapse was initiated (step 13).\nIdentify the persister cells. An example of E. coli BW25113 following ofloxacin treatment is shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]).\nPersister cells are defined as cells that are able to divide multiple times (n > 4), resulting in a substantial number of offspring. Eventually, this will result in a micro-colony, as can be observed in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] at time point 630 min.\nSensitive cells are cells that do not undergo multiple cell divisions, and as a result will not form a micro-colony.\nNote: Antibiotic-sensitive cell elongation/division depends on the applied antibiotic. For example, we do not observe cell elongation or cell division following tobramycin treatment of E. coli BW25113. Looking for microcolonies is an ideal way to quickly scan for persister cells in your time-lapse microscopy data.\nAnalyze the persister awakening kinetics.\nFollow the length of the persister cell in time. Note down in an excel file.\nDetermine the awakening lag from this growth curve. This is the time a cell needs to reach twice its initial size.\nOptional: If other antibiotics are used (e.g., aminoglycosides), the threshold to determine the awakening lag can be set to 1.5-fold its initial size as not all the persister cells elongate to 2-fold the initial size before division during post-antibiotic recovery occurs.",
    "Determine when cell division occurs. Do this in a consistent manner: e.g., set the time of cell division when a cell division plane is visible.\nFor every cell, calculate the time in between the awakening lag and cell division.\nAnalyze growth kinetics of sensitive cells, in cases where they elongate.\nRandomly select sensitive cells from the same frames that contain persister cells.\nFollow the cell length in time for at least the same number of sensitive cells as there are persister cells. However, the more the better.\nFollow the length of sensitive cells in time for 180 min. Following ofloxacin treatment, this time frame allows all sensitive cells to elongate.\nNote: This time frame might need optimization if other antibiotics/strains/media/... are used.\nDetermine the awakening lag for the sensitive cells. This is the time a cell needs to reach twice its initial size."
