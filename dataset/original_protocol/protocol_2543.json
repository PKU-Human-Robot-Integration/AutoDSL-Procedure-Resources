    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAssay for flippase activity at the plasma membrane\nTiming: 1 h\nUsing a floating lymphoma cell line, we describe protocols to detect flippase activity that translocates phospholipids from the outer to the inner leaflet of plasma membranes.12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12],13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13] Animal cells typically exhibit flippase activity for PtdSer and PtdEtn, and this activity depends on the expression of plasma membrane flippases, such as ATP11A and ATP11C, which are members of the type IV P-type ATPase family, in most cases.14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14] Flippase activity towards other phospholipids, such as PtdCho and SM, can be evaluated using similar procedures. The ATP11A mutant (Q84E) that aberrantly translocates PtdCho was analyzed using this protocol.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nWR19L or their transformant cells are expanded in RPMI1640-10% FCS containing 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin in a 10-cm culture dish.\nNote: Culture conditions may affect or compromise flippase activity. We generally maintain WR19L-derived cells between 1 × 104 and 2 × 106 cells/mL and do not exceed 2 × 106 cells/mL during the cell culture. For the assay, we typically use cells at 5×105–2×106 cells/mL.\nCount cells using a hemocytometer or cell counter (TC20, Bio-Rad) with trypan blue staining.\nTransfer 1–2 × 106 of viable cells to a 1.5- or 2-mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g at 20°C–25°C for 3 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and add 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nResuspend the cells and centrifuge at 300 × g at 20°C–25°C for 3 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 300 μL of HBSS containing 2 mM CaCl2 and 1 mM MgCl2.\nStand the tube in a dry block incubator set at 15 or 20°C for 7 min.\nNote: The incubation temperature needs to be optimized for the respective cell types within 10°C–20°C.",
    "Critical: Do not incubate cells at >20°C unless necessary. An incubation at 37°C or >20°C induces endocytosis and membrane trafficking, and NBD-lipids in the plasma membrane may be incorporated independent of flippase activity.\nAdd 2 μL of 1 mM NBD-PS or NBD-PE to 1 mL of HBSS with 2 mM CaCl2 and 1 mM MgCl2 (final concentration of 2 μM).\nImmediately add 300 μL of HBSS containing NBD-lipids (step 9) to the cell suspension (final concentration of 1 μM).\nNote: NBD-lipid concentration needs to be optimized for the respective cell types within 0.1–1 μM.\nNote: During the assay, NBD-lipids are kept in DMSO on ice and thawed before adding the solution. Diluted NBD-lipids in water or HBSS may be unstable.\nIncubate cells at 15 or 20°C in the dry block incubator.\nNote: We generally incubate cells with NBD-lipids within 40 min because a prolonged incubation may decrease the fluorescence signals of internalized NBD-lipids. Incubation times need to be optimized for the respective cell types and NBD-lipids. To prevent the cell precipitation, we pipet the cell suspension every 5–10 min during the assay.\nAt several time points, mix the cell suspension by pipetting and then transfer 100- to 150-μL aliquots quickly to a 1.5-mL tube with 150 μL of pre-chilled HBSS containing 5 mg/mL fatty acid-free BSA on ice to extract NBD-lipids from the outer leaflet.\nResuspend the cells quickly and incubate on ice for 1 min.\nNote: Fatty acid-free BSA efficiently extracts lysophospholipids or artificial NBD-lipids from the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane without inducing cell lysis.15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15],16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16] NBD-conjugation alters the phospholipid structure, and the hydrophilicity of the NBD moiety causes the acyl chain to tend toward to the lipid-water interface.17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17],18[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18] This characteristic of NBD-lipids enables the BSA-mediated extraction.",
    "Note: Incubation with 5 mg/mL fatty acid-free BSA on ice for 1 min was sufficient to fully extract NBD-lipids in the outer leaflet of plasma membranes of WR19L or a human myeloma cell line that we used previously.19[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19] The fluorescence signals should be compared in both the presence and absence of BSA to assess whether the BSA-mediated lipid extraction works. Treatment with BSA should quickly reduce the fluorescence signals of NBD-PC, which is not flipped to the inner leaflet at 15°C. Nevertheless, optimization is required for other cell types.\nCritical: A prolonged incubation in this step at 20°C–25°C or a higher temperature may reduce fluorescence signals, regardless of the BSA-mediated extraction.\nTransfer 300 μL of the cell suspension to a 5-mL round-bottomed test tube with a cell strainer snap cap (FALCON, ref. 352235).\nAnalyze cells immediately with FACSCanto II or FACSAria III (BD) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2176-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Flippase activity at the plasma membrane\nThe flippase, ATP11A, and its mutant (Q84E) translocate NBD-lipids at the plasma membrane. The cells were incubated with 1 μM NBD-lipids at 20°C for the indicated times. Atp11a-Atp11c double-null (DKO) WR19L-derived cells exhibit weak flippase activity towards NBD-PS, NBD-PE, NBD-PC, and NBD-SM on the cell surface (black line). Expression of wild-type human ATP11A (blue line) and its mutant (Q84E) (red line) conferred flippase activity for NBD-PS and NBD-PE in DKO cells, whereas only the ATP11A mutant aberrantly translocated NBD-PC on the cell surface. Experiments were performed three times, and average values were plotted with S.D. (bar). Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] is adapted from the data in1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] with modifications.\nNote: The analysis by flow cytometry needs to be quickly performed. We generally use FACSCanto II (BD) in the high-speed mode and record 2,000 or 3,000 cells within 1 min.",
    "Note: We gate cells by standard forward and side scatter (FSC/SSC) gating on the BD FACSDiva software to exclude dead cells from the population. Dead cell staining reagents, such as SYTOX Blue, are also available for the assay.\nNote: Atp11a-Atp11c double-deficient mutant (DKO) cells specifically lose flippase activity for PtdSer and PtdEtn,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14] and they are valid as host cells for analyzing the flippase activity of type IV P-type ATPase family members localized at the plasma membrane (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). The expression of ATP11A or the ATP11A mutant (Q84E) confers the flippase activity toward NBD-PS and NBD-PE in DKO cells. In contrast, basal activity toward NBD-PC and NBD-SM is low, and only cells expressing the Q84E mutant aberrantly flip NBD-PC (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). To obtain the best signal-to-noise ratio, the NBD-lipid concentration and incubation temperature should be optimized depending on the cell type. Using mouse and human lymphoma cell lines, we typically titrate from 0.1 to 1 μM at 15 or 20°C.\nCritical: This assay detects the unidirectional translocation of phospholipids from the outside to the inside of the plasma membrane. Accordingly, it cannot detect floppase or scramblase activity in the opposite direction on the plasma membrane or flippase activity on the intracellular membranes.\nAssay for detection of PtdSer on the cell surface\nTiming: 1 h",
    "PtdSer is confined to the inner leaflet of plasma membranes under steady-state conditions, but is exposed on the cell surface in several biological processes, such as apoptosis, blood clotting, and lymphocyte activation. The externalization of PtdSer can be detected with PtdSer-binding proteins, such as Annexin V,20[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20] MFG-E8,21[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21],22[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22] and Evectin-2.23[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23] Annexin V, but not MFG-E8 nor Evectin-2, requires calcium at a concentration of 1–3 mM to bind to PtdSer. MFG-E8 facilitates efferocytosis of apoptotic cells in a PtdSer-dependent manner, whereas Evectin-2 plays an essential role in retrograde transport from recycling endosomes to the trans-Golgi network.24[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24] Annexin V and MFG-E8 or its PtdSer-binding (C2) domain are used to detect PtdSer and are commercially available.\nWR19L or their transformant cells are expanded in RPMI1640-10% FCS containing 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin in a 10-cm culture dish.\nCount cells using a hemocytometer or cell counter (TC20, Bio-Rad) with trypan blue staining.\nTransfer 1 × 106 of viable cells to a 1.5- or 2-mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g at 20°C–25°C for 3 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and add 1 mL of Annexin staining buffer (10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH=7.4, 140 mM NaCl, and 2.5 mM CaCl2).\nNote: HEPES-NaOH is also available for Annexin staining buffer.\nResuspend cells and centrifuge at 300 × g at 20°C–25°C for 3 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and add 1 mL of Annexin staining buffer containing 1,000-fold diluted Annexin V-Cy5 (BioVision) and 5 μg/mL PI.\nNote: MFG-E8-FITC can be used at a final concentration of 10–50 nM instead of Annexin V.\nIncubate at 20°C for 3 min in a dry block incubator.\nNote: Alternatively, incubate at 4°C or on ice for 30 min.",
    "Transfer 500 μL of the cell suspension to a 5-mL round-bottomed test tube with a cell strainer snap cap, followed by an analysis with FACSCanto II or FACSAria III (BD) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2176-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Asymmetrical distribution of PtdSer and its exposure on the cell surface\nW3 cells, a derivative of WR19L, confine PtdSer under steady-state conditions, and these cells are not stained with Annexin V, exhibiting PtdSer asymmetry. PtdSer is externalized to the outer leaflet by a calcium ionophore stimulation, and it binds Annexin V. Percentages in the population are shown in dot plots.\nOptional: When intracellular calcium levels increase, cells expose PtdSer through the action of a calcium-dependent scramblase, TMEM16F.25[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25] As a positive control for PtdSer exposure, the remaining 500 μL of the cell suspension in step 24 can be stimulated by the calcium ionophore, A23187, at a final concentration of 1–3 μM. We generally incubate cells at 25 or 30°C for 5 min to induce PtdSer exposure. Most cells are not stained by Annexin V under steady-state conditions but bound firmly to PtdSer on the cell surface upon A23187 treatment without inducing PI-positive cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nNote: A23187 has a fluorescence spectrum similar to that of SYTOX Blue. Therefore, PI may be preferred to exclude dead cells in the presence of A23187.\nOptional: Ionomycin, another calcium ionophore, can be used to induce PtdSer exposure instead of A23187. In this case, SYTOX Blue can be used at a final concentration of 100 nM instead of PI.\nCritical: A high concentration of A23187 or ionomycin and prolonged incubation may cause cell death. Accordingly, the concentration and incubation time must be optimized for each cell type.\nAssay for the detection of SM- or cholesterol-rich domains in the outer leaflet of plasma membranes",
    "The worm toxin, Lysenin, exclusively binds to SM-rich membrane domains and induces pore formation in the plasma membrane. Kiyokawa et al. generated a truncated Lysenin tagged with RFP that binds SM without pore formation or cell toxicity.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] Perfringolysin O (PFO) is a toxin secreted by Clostridium perfringens that binds to cholesterol in the outer leaflet of plasma membranes.26[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26] Cholesterol on the cell surface may be classified into two classes, “accessible” and “inaccessible” pools, based on its ability to bind PFO. Cholesterol associated with SM becomes an “inaccessible” form.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] D4 of PFO is sufficient for cholesterol binding without cell toxicity, and it fuses with the fluorescent protein, mCherry, to generate mCherry-D4 for monitoring the membrane properties of cholesterol.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10],11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] To increase the bacterial expression levels of NT-Lys-mRFP and mCherry-D4, we employed a cold-shock expression system using the pCold I DNA vector, which included the cold-shock protein A (cspA) promoter for the high-yield production of recombinant proteins in E. coli.27[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]\nExpression of His-tagged NT-Lys-mRFP or mCherry-D4 in E. coli\nTiming: ∼3 days\nTransform 50 μL of chaperone-competent cells pGro7/BL21 with 1–10 ng of pCold I-His6-mRFP-NT-Lys or pCold I-His6-mCherry-D4 in a 1.5-mL tube.\nStand the tube on ice for 10–15 min.\nStand the tube at 42°C for 45 s in a dry block incubator.\nStand the tube on ice for 1–2 min.\nAdd 1 mL LB medium without antibiotics.\nShake the tube at 180–200 rpm at 37°C for 60 min.\nTen- to one hundred-microliter aliquots are plated onto an LB agar plate containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 20 μg/mL chloramphenicol.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C for 12–16 h.\nA colony is selected and transferred to a 50-mL tube with 10 mL LB medium containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 20 μg/mL chloramphenicol.\nShake the tube at 180–200 rpm at 37°C for 12–16 h.",
    "Five-milliliter aliquots are transferred to a 1-L flask with 250 mL of LB medium containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin, 20 μg/mL chloramphenicol, and 0.8 mg/mL ʟ-arabinose.\nNote: ʟ-arabinose may be added at step 39.\nGrow cells under shaking at 180–200 rpm at 37°C for 3 h.\nMeasure optical density at 600 nm (OD600) every 30 min.\nWhen OD600 reaches approximately 0.5, stand the flask in an incubator at 15°C for 30 min without shaking.\nAdd IPTG at a final concentration of 0.1 mM (mRFP-NT-Lys) and 0.2 mM (mCherry-D4), respectively.\nNote: If ʟ-arabinose is not added at step 35, it may be added at a final concentration of 0.8 mg/mL at this step together with IPTG.\nShake the flask at 180–200 rpm at 15°C for 24 h.\nNote: If expressed, the color of the culture becomes magenta by RFP or mCherry in E. coli.\nCollect cells, transfer them to a 250-mL tube, and centrifuge at 2,500 × g at 4°C for 10 min.\nRemove the supernatant and wash the pellets with PBS.\nCentrifuge at 2,500 × g at 4°C for 10 min.\nRepeat steps 42 and 43.\nRemove the supernatant, and the bacteria pellet is snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.\nStore the pellet at −80°C.\nPause point: Store the pellet at −80°C for up to one month.\nPurification of His-tagged NT-Lys-mRFP or mCherry-D4\nTiming: ∼3 days\nThaw the frozen pellet and stand the tube on ice.\nAdd 10 mL of buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH=8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM DTT) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Nacalai).\nSuspend the pellets and transfer the cell suspension to a 15-mL tube.\nStand the tube on ice.",
    "Disrupt the cells by sonication (Branson digital Sonifer SFX 250, EMERSON) at an amplitude of 35% (3-s on and 15-s off) and repeat the on-off procedure 20–30 times.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 × g at 4°C for 20 min and transfer the supernatant to a new 50-mL tube.\nAdd 20 mL buffer A supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail.\nAdd 1 mL of buffer A-equilibrated Ni-NTA Agarose (QIAGEN).\nRotate the tube at approximately 10 rpm at 4°C for 12–16 h.\nCentrifuge at 3,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min.\nNote: If NT-Lys-mRFP or mCherry-D4 binds Ni-Agarose, the precipitated agarose becomes magenta after centrifugation, and the color of the supernatant becomes clear.\nRemove the supernatant and suspend agarose in 5 mL of buffer A.\nBeads are loaded on a Poly-Prep Chromatography Column (Bio-Rad) at 4°C.\nThe column is sealed with a silicone stopper and connected with a three-way stock cock and tube (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2176-Fig3.jpg\nFigure. 3. Schematic of the purification procedures\nThe purification procedure is outlined. A photograph depicts the connection of a three-way stock cock to the column at step 59.\nLoad pre-chilled PBS into the column over 12–16 h by adjusting the three-way stopcock (the total wash volume is approximately 2 L).\nBound proteins are sequentially eluted with 4 mL elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH=7.5, 150 mM NaCl) by increasing imidazole in a stepwise manner from 10 to 500 mM (10, 100, 200, 300, and 500 mM). The total volume of elution buffer is 20 mL.\nNote: An elution of His-tagged NT-Lys-mRFP or mCherry-D4 may be chased in real-time by the color of eluates. Typically, the recombinant proteins are eluted at 100–200 mM of imidazole. However, we recommend analyzing all fractions by SDS-PAGE and then pooling appropriate fractions.",
    "Eluates at appropriate fractions are mixed and loaded to pre-equilibrated Amicon Ultra -15 Centrifugal Filters (10 K cut-off, MERCK).\nCentrifuge at 4,000 × g at 4°C for 1–2 h to concentrate the solutions.\nNote: We generally concentrate until the volume is less than 1 mL.\nTransfer concentrated eluates to a micro dialyzer (Xpress Micro Dialyzer MD300 12–14 kDa, Scienova) and dialyze against 2 L of PBS at 4°C with stirring for 12–16 h.\nChange PBS to another 2 L of PBS and dialyze with stirring at 4°C.\nPurified proteins are aliquoted, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C.\nPause point: Store recombinant proteins at −80°C for at least one year.\nMeasurement of NT-Lys-mRFP or mCherry-D4 concentrations\nTiming: 1 day\nPurified proteins and BSA proteins in a series of concentrations (1 μg - 31.25 ng) as a standard are separated with SDS-PAGE using a 5%–15% gradient gel (Extra PAGE One, Nacalai).\nThe gel is stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) (PAGEBlue Protein Staining Solution, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and analyzed with the ChemiDoc MP Imaging system and Image Lab software (Bio-Rad) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2176-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Representative histograms of non-stained (grey) and stained (purple) cells are shown. The ATP11A Q84E mutant aberrantly flips PC in the plasma membranes, and the PC content in the outer leaflet decreases. In accord with the decrease of PC, Q84E-expressing cells carry high SM-rich domains on the cell surface, staining intensely with NT-Lys, while it decreases the “accessible” pool of cholesterol, impairing D4 staining.
