    "1. Protocol for bang-sensitive assay\nEstablish the experimental flies by crossing the tub-Gal4 driver line with the UAS-cac-RNAi line via the Gal4/UAS system21. Collect the virgin flies of the tub-Gal4 line and the male flies of the UAS-cac-RNAi line. Then, transfer the virgin and male flies into the same vial to harvest the offspring.\n\tNOTE: The tub-Gal4 driver line will allow achieving global knockdown of the cac gene. Use the UAS-cac-RNAi line as the control group.\nAfter 3-5 days of eclosion, gently anesthetize the flies using the 100% CO2 (CO2 anesthesia equipment) and collect both the tub-Gal4>UAS-cac-RNAi flies and the UAS-cac-RNAi flies with a brush. Transfer these flies to new, clean food vials 1 day before testing to ensure they are well-prepared.\nGently anesthetize the flies using the CO2. Once anesthetized, carefully place 4-6 flies into individual fresh vials. Allow the flies to recover from anesthesia for about 1 h before proceeding with the testing.\n\tNOTE: For each genotype, a minimum of five trials were tested, and each trial consisted of six vials of flies.\nSet up the recording equipment. Position a camera (720-1080P, 30-60 FPS at least, AF locked) on a tripod in front of a whiteboard. Adjust the camera's focus manually using an empty vial to ensure clear and accurate footage.\nUse a vortex mixer to perform the mechanically induced seizure-like behavior. Place each vial containing 4-6 flies onto the vortex mixer and run it at the highest setting (2800 rpm) for exactly 10 s. After the vortexing, promptly place the vial on the whiteboard.\nObserve the flies and record any seizure-like behavior they exhibit.\n\tNOTE: Seizure-like behavior observed in flies consists of three stages: seizure (manifesting as vibrating wings), paralysis, and recovery24. The ratio of seizure flies to tested flies was defined as seizure rate.",
    "Measure the recovery time as the time required after vortexing until flies regain the ability to stand upright25.\n2. Protocol for calcium imaging of ex vivo brain\nEstablish the tub-Gal4>UAS-GCaMP6m and tub-Gal4>UAS-GCaMP6m/cac-RNAi line flies, respectively. Generate the flies using the Gal4/UAS binary expression system21 to allow monitoring of calcium activity in the ex vivo brain.\nPrepare the dissection solution as described in the provided recipe (Table 1)26.\n\t\nPrepare the external solution as described in Table 1. Adjust to pH 7.2 with NaOH and adjust osmolarity to 250-255 mOsm/L.\n\t\tNOTE: The external solution can be stored at 4 °C for 1 week.\nFor preparing the dissection solution, add 9 units of papain suspension and L-lysine (2 mg/mL) to 600 µL of the external solution. Vortex the solution and wait 15 min until the solution is clear.\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to use the dissection solution within 4 h.\nPerfuse the external solution with oxygenated saline (95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide) for 5 min before use. Use the pipette to transfer about 10 µL of the dissection solution to a Petri dish. This solution will provide the necessary conditions for brain dissection and imaging.\nCarefully dissect the brains of both the tub-Gal4>UAS-GCaMP6m and tub-Gal4>UAS-GCaMP6m/cac-RNAi lines using the syringe needles and microscope. Follow the established protocol for brain dissection27.\nUse a pipette to transfer the prepared brain into a recording dish containing 5 mL of fresh external solution and immobilize the brain using a C-sharp holder in the recording dish for 3-5 min for recovery.\n\tNOTE: The C-sharp holder was made of a metal semicircle with 7 mm diameter crossed by parallel fibers 0.5 mm apart.\nConfocal imaging setup and acquisition",
    "For confocal imaging, capture each brain with a 20x objective and xyt Scanning Mode. Identify the mushroom body neurons with an additional 4.5x digital amplification based on 20x optical amplification.\n\t\tNOTE: Each ex vivo brain can be imaged for more than 1 h.\nAcquire the whole brain-GCaMP6m emission at 488 nm laser excitation with 16 µw laser power. Set the scanning parameters to a speed of 400, with a pixel size of 256 pixels x 256 pixels. Use a 5.3 Hz acquisition rate and record for a duration of 3 min.\nIdentify 5-8 ROIs in every brain and analyze the fluorescence. Manually determine the cell body of mushroom body neurons as the region of interest28.\n\t\nLabel the identified neurons and measure their fluorescence intensities by ImageJ. Analyze the Fluorescence data of GCaMP6m via %ΔF/F = (F1-F0)/(F0-B). Define the intracellular fluorescence, increasing between 2 and 2.5 standard deviations above the baseline, as small spikes, and intracellular fluorescence, increasing greater than 2.5 standard deviations above the baseline, as large spikes. Analyze the frequency of calcium spikes by Student's t-test.\n\t\tNOTE: F0 was defined as the baseline by the mean fluorescence intensity of the initial 5 frames in ROIs, F1 as the fluorescence intensity of the given time point, and B as the background without fluorescence. Temporal physiological activities of neurons are also helpful in distinguishing them from noise signs.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
