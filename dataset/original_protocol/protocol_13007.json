Also, a synthetic DNA sequence (Table of Materials) for translating T4 lysozyme (T4L) was inserted into the N-terminus of S1PRs in order to facilitate receptor expression and purification.\nPreparation of the baculovirus encoding S1PRs, Gi1, and Gβ1γ2\n\t\nAdd the recombinant vectors to 50 µL of DH5α competent Escherichia coli (E. coli) stored in a 1.5 mL tube at -80 °C, and incubate on ice for 30 min.\nHeat-shock the cells at 42 °C for 90 s, transfer them to the ice immediately, and chill them for 2 min.\nShake the tube at 37 °C for 3-5 h after supplementing with 300 µL of lysogeny broth (LB) medium.

A detailed step-wise guide for experimental setup and execution. In brief, the receptor and modified luciferase were transiently co-expressed in CHO-K1 cells by transfecting the receptor and Sensor plasmid into the cells with transfection reagent. The cells were suspended in HBSS solution with D-Luciferin-potassium salt, the luciferase substrate, and seeded into a 96-well plate after 24 h. To allow permeation into the cells, D-luciferin must be pre-equilibrated with the cells. The oxidative enzyme luciferase transforms luciferin to oxyluciferin and emits light. The modified luciferase, on the other hand, generates light via a chemical reaction only when bound to cAMP, and the intensity of light has a positive association with cAMP levels in cells. The levels of cAMP were regulated with GPCR activated by agonist. Gi-coupled receptors reduced the levels of cAMP, necessitating the addition of forskolin to activate the adenylyl cyclase in the Gi-inhibition cAMP experiment.
