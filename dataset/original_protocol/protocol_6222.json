    "Yeast sampleCulture yeast cells in 5 ml YPD medium (see Recipes) in round bottom tubes in a shaker incubator at 30 °C for 24 h or according to the requirements of a specific strain or a specific experiment.Transfer 500 μl of the culture into a centrifuge tube, centrifuge for 1 min at 4,000 x g and discard the supernatant.Resuspend the cells in 1 ml PBS (pH 7.2-7.4, see Recipes), centrifuge for 1 min at 4,000 x g and discard the supernatant.Resuspend the cells in 50 μl PBS-based FM4-64 solution (50 μM) and incubate for 3 min at room temperature in the dark. Note: Keep FM4-64 solution in the dark and stock solution on ice. Samples that have been labeled with FM4-64 should be imaged within 10 min, as the dye will eventually be endocytosed. Endocytosis of FM4-64 is indicated by internal signal, typically occuring in the form of small spheres. Add 1 ml PBS solution and centrifuge for 1 min at 4,000 x g, discard the supernatant. Repeat this step one time.Transfer 2 μl stained cells onto a microscope slide and add 10 μl PBS, mix by stirring with the pipet tip and place a coverslip.Note: If there are issues with cell movement during imaging, yeast cells can be immobilized on slides coated with polylysine or an agarose pad.  Mount the slide on the microscope and locate cells using bright field mode with a 100x objective.Note: Especially with samples of microorganisms, it is important to minimize exposure to laser light, which will cause bleaching. Therefore, it is recommended to adjust focus in bright field mode before switching to confocal mode and immediately acquire an image. Switch to confocal acquisition with 488 nm or 514 nm laser and a 582/75 nm bandpass emission filter to detect FM4-64 emission (see Notes).",
    "Pinhole diameter should be below two airy discs (about 100 μm).Set imaging parameters (laser power, detector gain or exposure time) to get a bright signal without overexposure. Acquire images. Typically, one image of 3-6 different areas per sample can be taken.Prepare additional samples following Steps A2 to A8, but instead of adding PBS to the slide in Step A6, add PBS-based Trypan blue solution, each time with a different concentration (1, 5, 10, 50 and 100 μM). Acquire images of each sample without changing any imaging parameters. Arabidopsis thaliana seedling root sampleGrow Arabidopsis seedlings in half-strength MS medium on plates (see Recipes) at 22 °C with 16 h light/8 h dark for 7 d (Figure 1).Put a whole seedling into a tube containing 20 μM PBS-based FM4-64 solution, incubate for 3 min and wash with PBS solution in a staining jar.Add 50 μl PBS onto a microscope slide, arrange the seedling on the slide and add cover slip onto the root part of the seedling (Figure 1).Find the target region, for example the elongation zone, using a 40x objective and bright filed mode. Switch to confocal acquisition with 488 nm or 514 nm laser and a 582/75 nm bandpass emission filter to detect FM4-64 emission (see Notes). Pinhole diameter should be below two airy discs (about 100 μm).Set imaging parameters (laser power, detector gain or exposure time) to give a bright signal without overexposure. Acquire images. Typically, one image of 1-3 different areas per sample can be taken.Prepare additional samples following Steps B2 to B5, but instead of adding PBS to the slide in Step B3, add PBS-based Trypan blue solution, each time with a different concentration (1, 5, 10, 50 and 100 μM). Acquire images of each sample without changing any imaging parameters. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190819/20190819012356_6376.jpgFigure 1.",

Seedling mounted on a slide with root covered by the cover slip. Maize leaf samplePut two layers of tape along the long edge of a large cover slip, leaving a groove in the middle (Figure 2). This facilitates the efficient exchange of quencher solution without moving the sample. Note: Although this operation is more complicated than the ones described for the other samples, it can lead to higher data reliability when the effect of all quencher concentrations was measured on the same cell. The whole protocol should be finished within 10 to 15 min to prevent FM4-64 endocytosis from influencing the results.  Make a cut into a maize leaf using a razor blade and start peeling the lower epidermis using forceps. Cut a small piece of leaf together with the peeled epidermis (Figure 2).Note: Separating the maize leaf epidermis from the rest of the leaf helps to provide more reliable results through minimization of chlorophyll fluorescence, whose spectrum overlaps with that of FM4-64. Stain sample with 50 μM PBS-based FM4-64 solution in a centrifuge tube for 3 min, wash with PBS buffer in a staining jar (Figure 2).Add 100 μl PBS to the groove of the large cover slip and arrange the maize leaf sample in it. Cover the sample with a square cover slip (Figure 2).Find the target region using a 40x objective in bright field mode. Switch to confocal acquisition with 488 nm or 514 nm laser and a 582/75 nm bandpass emission filter to detect FM4-64 emission (see Notes). Pinhole diameter should be below two airy discs (about 100 μm).",
    "Set imaging parameters (laser power, detector gain or exposure time) to give a bright signal without overexposure. Acquire one image of the target region. Without removing the sample from the microscope, use filter paper to drain the buffer and immediately add PBS-based Trypan blue solution, starting with the lowest concentration (1 μM).Aquire one image and change to the next higher concentration as described in the step above. Repeat until images at all concentrations (1, 5, 10, 50, 100 μM) have been acquired.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190819/20190819012419_9675.jpgFigure 2.
