    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPrepare microfluidic system for experiment\nTiming: ∼1 h\nThis step prepares the microfluidic equipment and solutions for experimentation. For complete details regarding the design, fabrication, cleaning, and preparation of microfluidic devices for behavioral and neural imaging of C. elegans please refer to Lagoy and Albrecht (2015)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]. For video protocols of microfluidic device setup and operation, see Reilly et al. (2017)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]. This example uses Copper chloride solution to stimulate the ASH aversive neurons.\nClean microfluidic device and top and bottom glass pieces by rinsing sequentially with water and 70% ethanol, wiping with a lint-free wipe, then drying in an air stream. Remove any dust with transparent tape, then align and secure with binder clips or a microscope slide holder (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 3C).\nPlace device in a vacuum desiccator for 30 min.\nPrepare 200 mL of Saline buffer and use it to prepare 60 mL of Control buffer (1 μg/mL fluorescein) and 60 mL of Copper chloride stimulus solution (1 mM CuCl2).\nAttach 3 reservoirs to the reservoir rack stand above the microscope (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1822-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Microfluidics and microscope imaging set up\n(A) Reservoirs are held over the device with a tubing rack stand. Tubing from the reservoirs is connected either directly into the device or through the 3-way actuated valve for fluidic control. The device is positioned above the objective on the microscope.\n(B) Close up image of the microfluidic device with all tubing attached in the inlets, worm loading (WL) port, and the outlet.\n(C) Schematic of the 20 x 20 mm microfluidic device. Black lines represent 70 μm tall fluid channels. Stimulus (Stim) and Buffer (Buf) streams flow continuously, whereas only one control fluid inlet flows at any time.",
    "(D) Actuating the 3-way valve directs control fluid to the control1 inlet and the stimulus into the arena (left). Otherwise, control fluid enters at the control2 inlet and buffer enters the arena (right). Proper flow balance is shown, with fluorescein dye used as the stimulus fluid. Note that some of the fluid entering the arena also bypasses it via the upper and lower curved channels. These streams should be narrow and have equal width in the upper and lower channels. Adjust reservoir heights as needed.\nFill each of the 3 reservoirs with their designated solutions (60 mL of Saline buffer, Control buffer, or Copper chloride solution) and purge all bubbles from the connected tubing using the priming syringe (see Reilly et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] and troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Note 1). Actuate the valve to fill all tubes connected to the 3-way fluidic valve.\nFill the waste reservoir with ≥10 mL Saline buffer and use the priming syringe to fill both the outflow waste tube and the outflow outlet tube with buffer (see Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G and 3H).\nAfter 30 min in the vacuum desiccator, remove the device and mount it on the microscope.\nFill microfluidic device with fluid.\nInsert the outflow tubing into the waste outlet of the microfluidic device.\nEnsure the outflow valve is open and gently push buffer through the device using the priming syringe.\nWhen liquid droplets form at all 4 of the inlets, close the outflow valve (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B and 4C).\nInsert tubing or a blocking pin into the worm loading inlet.\nGently insert each reservoir’s tubing into the appropriate inlet (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nConnect the control reservoir 3-way valve (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E) “normally-closed” outlet to the “control1” inlet and its “normally-open” outlet to the “control2” inlet.\nInsert tubing approximately 3 mm into the PDMS inlet hole (to ∼2/3 depth).",
    "Use “drop-to-drop” connections, in which a droplet hangs from the tubing end and is connected to a liquid droplet above the microfluidic port (see Lagoy and Albrecht, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nRemove any excess liquid from the glass by vacuum aspiration or paper towel.\nOpen the outflow valve to establish flow. View live images in the microscope and verify that no bubbles are present in the device channels (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Note 1).\nBalance inlet flows.\nFocus on the intersection of inlet channels (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C and 4D) and observe flow patterns while alternately activating and deactivating the 3-way stimulus valve.\nAdjust reservoir heights up or down so that flow from Saline buffer and Copper chloride solution are equal and flow from Control buffer enables complete switching between Saline buffer and Copper chloride solution into the downstream imaging area (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D and troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Note 2).\nCritical: Avoid introducing bubbles into the device during device preparation (see also troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Note 1). Ensure that the outflow valve is open only when all device inlet and outlet ports are connected to tubing or blocking pins. Close the outflow valve whenever any tubing adjustments are made.\nLoad animal into microfluidic device\nTiming: ∼15 min\nThis step describes loading an individual animal into the microfluidic device without disturbing the fluidic set up or introducing bubbles.\nGently transfer one young adult C. elegans to a small (35 or 60 mm) unseeded Nematode Growth Medium (NGM) agar plate.\nFlood the NGM plate about halfway to the rim with Saline buffer.\nFill the worm loading syringe with ∼1 mL Saline buffer and purge any bubbles.\nDraw an animal into the worm loading syringe.\nWith a drop-to-drop connection, submerge the tip of the worm loading syringe under the saline solution.",
    "Keeping the tip of the syringe submerged, gently draw the swimming animal into the tubing section of the worm loading syringe. Do not draw the animal into the syringe barrel.\nClose the outlet valve to cease flow through the microfluidic device.\nConnect the worm loading tubing to the microfluidic device.\nRemove the blocking pin from the worm loading inlet and allow a small droplet to form by briefly opening the buffer reservoir valve.\nInsert the worm loading tubing with a drop-to-drop connection.\nRemove excess liquid from the glass by aspiration or paper towel.\nEstablish fluid flow in the microfluidic arena.\nOpen the outlet valve to resume flow. Typical flowrate is about 1 μL/s or ∼4 mL/h, and is proportional to the difference in fluid height between inlet and outlet reservoirs.\nAdjust flowrate by raising or lowering reservoirs. Behavior is generally insensitive to flowrate (Albrecht and Bargmann, 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nInsert worm into the microfluidic arena.\nVerify that saline buffer is present in the imaging arena (deactivate stimulus valve if not).\nApply gentle pressure to the worm loading syringe plunger until the animal enters the arena.\nMonitor the animal for 1–2 min to ensure behavior is normal and the animal is healthy (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Note 3).\nSet testing parameters and run experiment\nTiming: 5–10 min setup, 12 h duration\nThis step describes the final steps of setting experimental parameters to determine sleep/wake state prior to running the closed-loop script.\nCapture a single image frame of the arena under brightfield illumination with the animal visible.\nUsing the “ImageJ” toolbar in “Micro-Manager,” import the image frame at 25% scale.",
    "Using the rectangle tool, draw a box spanning the outermost points of the arena where the animal will roam. This selection box will be the area of interest used for analyzing animal movement. Record the dimensions (x, y, w, h) of the rectangle, visible in the ImageJ toolbar window (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1822-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Micro-manager software and selection of the arena area-of-interest for sleep detection\nUsing the rectangle tool within ImageJ, drag a box across the entire arena, record the dimensional parameters, x and y position (of top left corner) and width (w) and height (h), and enter them into the script code.\nOpen “SleepDetection.ijm” and edit the variables x, y, w, and h near the top to define the selected area of interest, then save the file.\nLocate the “User Defined Closed Loop Settings.txt” file on the computer and set parameters as desired (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). Detailed information on each parameter is available within the file and in the “ClosedLoopSleepStim.bsh” script.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1822-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Sample experiment settings file\nThese sample settings define imaging resolution (bin 2), framerate (100 ms exposure = 10 frames/s), and illumination timing (20 ms for brightfield, 10 ms for fluorescence with 5 ms delay from exposure onset). Stimulation recordings capture 300 frames (or 30 s at 10 fps), and the stimulation program is a 10 s chemical pulse (valve 1 opens from frame 50–150 or from 5–15 s within each recording trial). The entire experiment lasts 12 h. Sleep state changes are monitored using a 10-s interval and changes must persist for 3 intervals (i.e., 30 s) to register a transition. After each stimulation trial, 15 min should elapse before triggering a new stimulation (regardless of any transitions within this time delay), and the next trigger shall begin following the opposite transition (i.e., Sleep-to-wake follows Wake-to-sleep).",
    "Run the “ClosedLoopSleepStim.bsh” within Micro-Manager to initiate the experiment.\nNote: Occasionally animals try to escape the microfluidic arena through the worm entry port (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Note 3). Most often this occurs at the beginning of the experiment, so it is advised to monitor progress during the first few minutes after loading the animals. Use the worm loading syringe to gently push the animal back into the field of view if the animal attempts to escape the arena, or load a new animal if necessary. Once the animal is well established in the arena, the experiment can run unattended."
