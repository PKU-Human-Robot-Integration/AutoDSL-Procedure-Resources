    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nFetal liver cells isolation\nTiming: 1 h\nThis protocol has been developed to isolate and culture early erythroid progenitor BFU-E cells. Sacrifice a pregnant mouse at 13.5 days gestation (approximately 6–9 fetuses) and place these fetuses in one tube for further isolation.\nDissect a pregnant mouse at 13.5 days gestation, cut the skin, and take out the uterus. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nUse fine tipped forceps to tear the uterus in the gap between the fetuses and squeeze out the fetuses.\nPlace fetuses into PBS in a culture dish, wash once, and place in a new culture dish.\nSqueeze the fetal liver from a fetus, remove connective tissues surrounding the liver, and put it into a 15 mL tube.\nNote: If using non-wild type or treated mice, place the fetus separately for further isolation.\nDissociate fetal liver cells by pipetting with 4 mL PBS-BSA, generating a single cell suspension.\nPass the cell suspension through a 30 μm pre-strainer into a new 15 mL tube. Count cell and centrifuge for 5 min at 300 × g at 4°C.\nMagnetic based cell sorting\nTiming: 2 h\nThe magnetic based erythroid cell sorting is adapted from McIver et al.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] and Flygare et al.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] All magnetic cell sorting procedures are performed on a clean benchtop.\nLineage negative (Lin-) cells isolation.\nAdjust the cell concentration of fetal liver cells to 100 × 106 cells/mL with PBS-BSA in a 1.5 mL tube.\nNote: Because subsequent antibody addition requires a certain volume, each 1.5 mL tube has 500 μL PBS-BSA containing 50 × 106 fetal liver cells.\nAdd 0.2 μg of each antibody of the biotin anti-mouse lineage panel per million cells, and incubate at 4°C for 15 min.\nNote: Before antibody incubation, it is recommended a blocking step, e.g., 10% serum.",
    "Wash off unbound antibody with 1X PBS, and centrifuge for 5 min at 300 × g at 4°C.\nResuspend cells with 500 μL PBS-BSA, add 2 μL streptavidin microbeads per million cells and incubate at 4°C for 30 min.\nPass the labeled fetal liver cells through the LS column according to manufacturer’s instructions: https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/CN-en/products/ls-columns.html#130-042-401[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/CN-en/products/ls-columns.html].\nCollect Lin- cells and centrifuge.\nAdjust cell concentration to 100 × 106 cells/mL for the second round of magnetic cell sorting.\nNote: The use of LS column can also reduce the residue of magnetic bead-bound cells.\nLin-CD34-CD41-CD16/32-Sca1- cells isolation.\nIncubate Lin- cells with 0.2 μg of each antibody of the biotin anti-mouse CD34, biotin anti-mouse CD41, biotin anti-mouse Sca-1, and biotin anti-mouse CD16/32 per million cells for 15 min at 4°C.\nWash off unbound antibody with 1X PBS.\nAdd 2 μL streptavidin microbeads per million cells, and incubate at 4°C for 30 min.\nPass the labeled fetal liver cells through the LS column according to manufacturer’s instructions https://[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/CN-en/products/ls-columns.html]www.miltenyibiotec.com/CN-en/products/ls-columns.html[href=http://www.miltenyibiotec.com/CN-en/products/ls-columns.html]#130-042-401, collect Lin-CD34-CD41-CD16/32-Sca1- cells.\nFlow cytometry sorting for BFU-E cells\nTiming: 3–4 h\nThis step is adapted from Flygare et al.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] to get higher purity BFU-E cells.\nCount cells, centrifuge 5 min at 300 × g at 4°C and resuspend cells with 400 μL PBS-BSA.\nNote: After magnetic based cell sorting, about 10 × 106 cells will be obtained from 9 embryos at E13.5 days.\nAssemble 0.2 μg of each antibody per million cells: APC anti-mouse c-Kit (CD117), PE anti-Streptavidin, and PE/Cy7 anti-mouse CD71.\nNote: Because most live/dead dyes are harmful to cells, cell debris and dead cells are simply excluded according to SSC and FSC.\nSingle stain control construction.\nHarvest 2 × 105 cells in 100 μL PBS-BSA.\nAdd each antibody individually to separate tubes.",
    "One tube with 2 × 105 cells unstained for use as a no-stain control.\nIncubate antibodies and cells in the dark at 4°C for 15–20 min.\nCentrifuge 5 min at 300 × g at 4°C, and wash off unbound antibody with 1 mL PBS, collect cells by centrifuge 5 min at 300 × g at 4°C.\nResuspend cells with 2 mL PBS for cell sorting with a flow cytometer.\nNote: When the sorter being prepared, the cells should be stored at 0.5% BSA-PBS solution at 4°C.\nSet the voltage and regulate the compensation of PE, PE/Cy7, and APC fluorescence using single stain control (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A–1C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3192-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. BFU-E cell sorting with flow cytometry\n(A) Compensation and gating of PE, (B) APC, and (C) PE/Cy7 fluorescence using single strain control.\n(D)FSC and SSC gating.\n(E) Streptavidin negative population for BFU-E sorting.\n(F) BFU-E sorting by flow cytometry according to the expression of CD71 and c-Kit, c-Kit+CD71- represents BFU-E.\nFor flow cell sorting, exclude cell debris and dead cells according to SSC and FSC (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D), take PE-streptavidin negative cells as gate 1 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E), BFU-E cells are sorted from Kit+ fraction according to CD71 expression (10% lowest CD71 expression part (CD7110%low))3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nExpansion culture\nTiming: 6–10 days\nThe expansion medium promotes the rapid expansion of early erythroid progenitor cells as referred to McIver’s describe.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] SCF (Kit receptor agonist) and dexamethasone (glucocorticoid receptor agonist) stimulate the expansion of early erythroid progenitor cells. Especially, we add N6-methyladenosine (6mdA) during the expansion culture of BFU-E cells, which can promote the proliferation of early erythroid progenitor cells in the range of 10–100 μM (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3192-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. 6mdA promotes the proliferation of BFU-E cells",
    "(A) Relative cell proliferation rate of BFU-E cells 6mdA treatment was analyzed by MTS. Each treatment contained six replicates. Data are presented as mean+/-SD. P values were calculated by one-way ANOVA for the 6mdA treated group compared with the no-6mdA (untreated) group of each day (no significance were not shown, ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001).\nNote: In this protocol, we test the concentration of 6mdA in the range of 10–100 μM; we speculate that 6mdA has the same effect when the concentration is greater than 100 μM.\nPlate the sorted BFU-E cells in expansion media at a concentration of 0.25–1 × 106 cells/mL in 6-well plate. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: The concentration of cells is important for BFU-E cell expansion, it is necessary to keep the cells in the optimal concentration range (0.25–1 × 106 cells/mL) with fresh expansion media.\nCells are cultured at 37°C and 5% CO2 in a sterile cell culture incubator."
