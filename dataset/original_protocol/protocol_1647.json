    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe protocol below describes (1) HCT116 H2B-GFP tumor cell seeding to create a CRC-on-chip model, (2) effluent media collection and analysis, and (3) on-chip live imaging to monitor tumor cell invasion.\nOrgan chip preparation and cell seeding\nTiming: 4 days (plus 7 days maintenance)\nThis section describes the seeding of HCT116 H2B-GFP cells onto Caco2 C2BBe1 Intestine-chips to create a CRC-on-chip model. CRC cell seeding is performed 40–48 h after the Intestine-chips have been connected to flow (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1207-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Experimental timeline\nDetailed overview of key steps on critical days of chip preparation, on-chip imaging, and effluent collection.\nPrepare Intestine-chip with appropriate extracellular matrix (ECM) (details are available in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section), intestinal epithelial cells (Caco2 C2BBe1) and HUVECs as detailed in (Kim et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Strelez et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). An abbreviated protocol is included below. Please refer to the aforementioned references for further information.\nActivate and apply the ECM to both channels of the chip on Day -4. Incubate the chips at 4°C overnight (roughly 12–16 h).\nOn Day -3, seed HUVECs in the bottom endothelial channel at a density of 6 × 106 cells/mL (120,000 cells/chip) in 20 μL/chip. Invert the chips and incubate at 37°C for 2 h. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nSeed Caco2 C2BBe1 cells in the top epithelial channel at a density of 1.25 × 106 cells/mL (62,500 cells/chip) in 50 μL/chip. Incubate at 37°C for 2 h.\nRemove any apparent bubbles within the chip (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]), connect chips to pods and initiate a regulate cycle. Normal flow will begin after the regulate cycle has completed.\nNote: The flow rate should be set to 30 μL/h. The percent deformation and frequency fields on the Zoë instrument should be set to zero at this time.",
    "Note: Intestine-chips are cultured with flow for approximately 40–48 h to allow the HUVECs and Caco2 C2BBe1 cells to become confluent and form a functional barrier.\nHarvest and then seed HCT116 H2B-GFP cells in the top epithelial channel on Day -1.\nAspirate out media from the 10 cm plate.\nWash cells with 1× DPBS and fully aspirate it from the plate.\nAdd 2–3 mL of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA to the plate.\nIncubate at 37°C for 5 min.\nNote: Inspect the plate under a microscope to ensure the successful detachment of cells from the plate.\nCollect the detached cells using a P1000 and place in a 15 mL Falcon tube.\nAdd Complete DMEM Cell Culture Media to the 15 mL Falcon tube containing the HCT116 H2B-GFP cell suspension to bring the total volume to 15 mL.\nNote: Complete DMEM Cell Culture Media is used on-chip to maintain the top epithelial channel throughout the course of the experiment, therefore Complete DMEM Cell Culture Media should be used upon HCT116 H2B-GFP cell seeding.\nNote: Media should be warmed for 1 h prior to use to ensure optimal cell viability for cell seeding.\nCentrifuge the cells at 200 × g for 5 min at room temperature (20°C–22°C).\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in a small volume of Complete DMEM Cell Culture Media.\nCount cells using an automated cell counter.\nNote: Here, a TC20 automated cell counter was used.\nPrepare appropriate cell suspension of 400,000 cells/mL (20,000 cells/chip) in 50 μL/chip.\nRemove the pods from the Zoë and place them in the biosafety cabinet (BSC).\nDisconnect chips from pods.\nSeed 35–50 μL of the HCT116 H2B-GFP cell suspension into the top epithelial channel of one chip utilizing the same cell seeding technique described by Emulate (https://www.emulatebio.com/[href=https://www.emulatebio.com/]).",
    "Note: After seeding 1 chip, check the seeding density and distribution of the cells under a microscope to ensure even cell seeding across the length of the channel (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nProceed with seeding HCT116 H2B-GFP cells in the top epithelial channel of the remaining chips.\nIncubate for 2 h at 37°C.\nRe-prime pods and reconnect chips to pods as described by Emulate (https://www.emulatebio.com/[href=https://www.emulatebio.com/]).\nNote: Ensure there is a liquid-liquid interface when reconnecting chips to pods to prevent the formation of bubbles that may obstruct fluid flow (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\nReturn pods to the Zoë and resume flow.\nNote: If chips and pods are disconnected users may choose to initiate a regulate cycle (defined in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) upon reconnection to ensure proper fluid flow.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1207-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. HCT116 seeding distribution on chip\nEven (left) and uneven (right) seeding of HCT116 H2B-GFP (green) cells in the top epithelial channel on D0. Scale bars represent 100 μm.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1207-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Media flow in pods\n(A) Pods contain reservoirs to hold top (red, right) and bottom (left, pink) channel effluent media. Equal media in both outlet reservoirs indicates proper fluid flow (A).\n(B) Irregular fluid flow (B) is indicated by the difference in effluent media heights (white arrow) suggesting an obstruction in the channel.\nMaintain chips for 7 days replenishing media every 3 days and aspirating the outflows to ensure the pods do not overflow.\nCritical: Channel specific media should be warmed at 37°C for 1 h prior to addition to the appropriate pod reservoirs.\nNote: Here, chips are maintained for 7 days but can be maintained for up to 14 days depending on the user’s needs.",
    "Note: Experimental conditions including the introduction of cyclic stretching are initiated after D0 imaging has been completed. To mimic peristalsis Zoë instruments are set to 10% deformation at 0.2 Hz upon the conclusion of D0 imaging.\nEffluent media assay\nTiming: 30 min\nThis step describes the collection of effluent media from pod reservoirs. Media can be collected, and the supernatant (A) stored for future downstream analysis (mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, ELISA, etc.) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). In addition, any circulating tumor cells (B) found in the endothelial effluent can be replated (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). Here, we describe how to quantitate the circulating tumor cells. The cells can be cultured for further characterization if desired (qPCR, etc.).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1207-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Effluent media collection\nMedia is collected from the endothelial channel effluent and centrifuged.\n(A and B) The supernatant (A) is placed in an appropriately labeled microcentrifuge tube and can be used for downstream analyses while any cells (B) are resuspended and plated to be counted.\nAlternatives: Here, media collection is performed 12–16 h post CRC cell seeding on day 0 (D0) and 6 days later, day 6 (D6). Alternate collection timepoints may be incorporated depending on the user’s needs. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7].\nAspirate bottom and top channel outflow reservoirs 2 days prior to desired date of media collection.\nNote: Here, outlet reservoirs are aspirated on D4.\nCritical: When aspirating outflows or collecting media ensure there is sufficient media remaining over the pod vias to avoid introducing bubbles at this stage.\nCollect 100–200 μL inlet media from the top and bottom pod inlet reservoirs of all chips of the same condition and place into appropriately labeled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nNote: Channel specific inlet media can be combined across multiple chips to collect the desired 1 mL media.",
    "Critical: Collect effluent media prior to disconnecting chips from their accompanying pods.\nCollect 1 mL outlet media from the top and bottom pod outlet reservoirs of each chip and place into appropriately labeled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes for effluent media collection and cell resuspension.\nNote: Ensure there is sufficient media remaining to cover the via to avoid introducing bubbles at this stage.\nCentrifuge the microcentrifuge tubes at 200 × g for 5 min.\nCollect the supernatant and place into a freshly labeled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube leaving about 100 μL for cell resuspension.\nCritical: Ensure not to disrupt any visible or non-visible pellet while collecting the supernatant.\nNote: The collected supernatant can be frozen and kept at −80°C. These samples can be later thawed and used for mass spectrometry and other similar assays.\nResuspend any cells present in the microcentrifuge tube with the remaining 100 μL and plate onto a 96-well plate.\nIncubate at 37°C until the cells have settled and adhered to the plate (roughly 2–3 h).\nImage the 96-well plate utilizing the Operetta High Content Screening platform. Imaging at a wavelength of 488 nm will capture the HCT116 H2B-GFP cells.\nInput images into the Perkin Elmer Harmony image analysis software.\nGFP+ cells are segmented based on morphological and intensity properties and GFP+ cell counts can be obtained for the replated cells.\nAlternatives: This protocol is optimized for imaging on the Perkin Elmer Operetta High Content Screening platform however, it is amenable for use with other imaging platforms and analysis software.\nAlternatives: After overnight incubation (roughly 12–16 h), exhausted media can be aspirated from the well and replenished with 100 μL of media. Wells can be maintained for as long as desired following standard tissue culture practices.",
    "Note: Any tumor cells that may have been in the effluent can be expanded and later collected for future RNA extraction, qPCR analysis or similar assays.\nNote: Effluent media was collected prior to imaging to minimize the amount of time chips are disconnected from flow.\nLive imaging\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThis section describes on-chip live imaging and quantifying tumor cells intravasating from the top, epithelial channel to the bottom, endothelial channel. Chips are imaged approximately 12–16 h after HCT116 seeding (D0) and can be imaged at various timepoints throughout an experiment, here six days later (D6). Any experimental conditions including the initiation of cyclic stretching (10% deformation, 0.2 Hz) are introduced following the completion of D0 imaging.\nStop flow and transfer pods from the Zoës to the BSC. Working 1 chip at a time, detach chip from pod and place on the stage of the Olympus FV3000 laser scanning confocal microscope. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9].\nImage 6 regions across the span of the chip where the top and bottom channels overlap (top and bottom inlet and outlet regions are excluded from invasion imaging) (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1207-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Live cell imaging and analysis\nSix regions of the CRC-on-chip consisting of Caco2 C2BBe1 cells (unlabeled) and HCT116 H2B-GFP cells (green) in the top epithelial channel and RFP-HUVECs (red) in the bottom endothelial channel separated by a porous membrane (dashed white line) were imaged via confocal microscopy. The number of GFP+ cells in each channel were identified using image analysis software and an invasion ratio was produced by comparing the number of GFP+ cells in the bottom channel relative to the top channel at each time point. Invasion ratios were normalized to D0 counts. Scale bars represent 300 μm.",
    "Note: Create and use a saved template with preset areas of the chip to ensure the same regions are imaged for each chip and across different timepoints.\nCritical: Imaging with the 488 nm and 561 nm lasers will capture the HCT116 H2B-GFP cells and the RFP-HUVECs, respectively. Transmitted light microscopy will allow for the identification of the unlabeled Caco2 C2BBe1 cells in the epithelial channel.\nImage from the bottom layer of the endothelial channel up through the epithelial channel (about 400 μm Z-height) at 5 μm intervals.\nNote: Work quickly and image a minimal number of chips at a time in order to reduce the risk of contamination and reduce the amount of time the chips are disconnected from environmental factors such as controlled temperature, C02, fluid flow, and stretching conditions.\nAfter completion of imaging, return chip to the BSC, and reconnect chip to pod and resume normal fluid flow.\nNote: Ensure there is a liquid-liquid interface between the chip and the pod and re-prime the pods as necessary per Emulate’s protocols (https://www.emulatebio.com/[href=https://www.emulatebio.com/]).\nInput images into Imaris imaging software.\nUse the Imaris cell detection algorithm (“spot detection” function) to find the number of GFP+ cells in each region (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]).\nNote: The cell detection algorithm enables segmenting a particular region of interest, which allows for dividing images into “top” and “bottom” channel, above and below the membrane, respectively.\nNote: The spot detection algorithm should be set to identify cells with a xy diameter of 8 μm and should include background subtraction.\nRecord the number of GFP+ tumor cells and calculate invasion ratio for each time point.\nAlternatives: This protocol is optimized for imaging on the Olympus FV3000 confocal microscope; however, it is amenable for use with other imaging platforms and analysis software.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1207_5.csv"
