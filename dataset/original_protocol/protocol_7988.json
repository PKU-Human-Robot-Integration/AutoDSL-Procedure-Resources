    "1. Experimental preparation\nCollect flies as they eclose into vials, separating male and female flies.\n\tNOTE: Sleep experiments are commonly conducted with female flies. It is important to collect virgin females. Mated females will lay eggs that hatch into larvae complicating the analysis of the data.\nHouse flies of a single sex in groups of <20.\n\tNOTE: Housing flies in a socially enriched environment (groups of >50) modulates sleep drive6,13 potentially confounding measurements of rebound sleep. Further, following social enrichment, sleep will decline over a few days6. Thus, baseline sleep is not stable complicating analysis of rebound sleep. Keeping flies in groups of <20 avoids this potential confound.\nKeep flies in vials for 3-5 days in a light and humidity controlled environment.\n\t​NOTE: Age and maturity of flies strongly influence sleep. Sleep is high in one day old flies and stabilizes by 3-5 days of age4. Flies are typically maintained on a 12 h light: 12 h dark schedule at 50% humidity.\n2. Preparation of tubes for sleep recording\nNOTE: Sleep is monitored using locomotor activity monitors. A monitor can hold 32 flies housed individually in 5 mm diameter tubes. Typically, genotypes are analyzed in groups of 16 or 32 flies.\nPrepare an appropriate number of tubes with fly food at one end.\n\tNOTE: Diet and metabolism are known to influence sleep33,34, hence it is particularly important to place flies on the same food on which they were reared.\nSeal the end of the tubes with wax.",
    "NOTE: Sleep deprivation and rebound is a five day experiment, and food can dry out if not properly sealed. In properly sealed tubes, food can be maintained for 10 days or more. Thus, it is critical to ensure that the ends of the tubes are sealed well. Flies can also get stuck to wet food, however. Thus, it helps to make tubes 1-2 days before the start of the experiment.\nIndividually place wake, behaving flies into 65 mm long glass tubes for sleep recording using an aspirator and plug the end of the tubes with a foam stopper.\n\t​NOTE: Flies are never re-exposed to CO2 anesthesia when placing flies into tubes for sleep recording. The aspirator is made from rubber tubing with one end covered with cheesecloth and inserted into a 1 mL pipette tip.\n3. Recording sleep\nLoad flies in tubes into activity monitors to monitor sleep.\n\t​NOTE: The SNAP rocks monitors back and forth from -60° to +60° every ~10 s. The monitors are held at -60° for ~5.9s ; it takes ~2.9 s for the tray holding the monitors to move from -60° to +60° and ~1 s to move back from +60° to -60°. The cycle length can be altered as needed by adjusting the voltage supplied to the motor.\n\t\nTake care to ensure that tubes are placed in activity monitors in the correct orientation. In the correct orientation, the end of the tube with food is at the top of the SNAP to ensure that flies do not get pushed into the food. In addition, the end with food is on the side of the monitor with the sleep recording jack. This allows activity monitors to be oriented correctly in the SNAP for efficient sleep deprivation while simultaneously monitoring activity.",
    "Place activity monitors in the recording chamber to monitor sleep.\nMonitor sleep for at least two full days to estimate baseline sleep.\n\tNOTE: The day flies are loaded into activity monitors is typically excluded as an adaptation day to allow flies to adapt to being housed in tubes. Baseline sleep is recorded for at least two full days (48hrs) beginning with the morning following the day flies are loaded.\nSave locomotor activity counts of flies in 1 min bins from the time of lights on a given day to lights on the previous day using activity recording software (e.g., from 8 AM to 8 AM).\nEstimate sleep from the locomotor activity data with custom macros using 5 min of inactivity as the threshold for a bout of sleep35.\n\t​NOTE: A number of sleep metrics are computed from the locomotor activity counts. These include sleep in min/h over 24 h, total sleep time in 24 h, average and maximum daytime and nighttime sleep bout lengths36.\n4. Sleep deprivation and recovery\nAs flies can be sleep deprived for variable lengths of time (e.g., 12 h, 24 h and 36 h) and recovery sleep can also be evaluated at various intervals (e.g., 6 h, 12 h, 24 h and 48 h), determine the duration of recovery by experimental need. Sleep recovery can be visualized using a sleep gain/loss plot or by examining percent sleep recovered over a predetermined interval (e.g., 6 h).\nIf sleep is stable over the two baseline days, on the third day, place activity monitors into the SNAP for overnight sleep deprivation.",
    "NOTE: Flies will exhibit a robust sleep rebound over a range of sleep times8,32,37,38, but sleep has to be stable to reliably evaluate rebound sleep. Sleep is stable when the difference in sleep between baseline days is ± 100 min.\nMake sure activity monitors are secured in place with monitor holder pins, monitor cords plugged in, and monitors oriented correctly with the end with food at the back, and plastic barriers in front (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: The SNAP is designed so the cam rotates once every 10 s (Figure 1). The plastic insert resets the tubes by pushing the tubes back when the apparatus is in the \"up\" position. Resetting the tubes is important to ensure that all tubes have the full range of motion at the beginning of each cycle.\nUnplug activity monitors, and take monitors out of the SNAP immediately upon lights on following overnight sleep deprivation.\n\tNOTE: It is critical that sleep deprivation is terminated, and flies are placed in recovery immediately upon lights on following 12 h of overnight sleep deprivation. Even a 20-30 min delay in placing flies into recovery can interfere with the extent of rebound sleep.\nPlace flies in a recording chamber where they will be undisturbed for two days (48 h) to monitor recovery sleep.\n\tNOTE: If the recording chamber is being used for other experiments, extra care must be taken to avoid stimulating recovering flies.\nCalculate the amount of sleep lost. For each individual fly, calculate the hourly difference between sleep obtained during sleep deprivation and the corresponding hour during baseline; sum the hourly differences to calculate total sleep lost.",
    "Calculate the amount of sleep recovered. For each individual fly, calculate the hourly difference between sleep obtained during recovery and the corresponding hour during baseline; sum the hourly differences to calculate total sleep gained.\n\tNOTE: Whether a fly is actually sleep deprived is empirical. Thus, the experimenter should examine percent sleep lost. If the fly has not lost a sufficient amount of sleep it can be excluded from the analysis. Although this might be required for other sleep deprivation approaches, it is rarely if ever required for the SNAP. More commonly, sleep may not be stable in a given fly prior to the initiation of sleep deprivation. If sleep is not stable, homeostasis cannot be calculated. We accept a maximum difference of ± 100 min of sleep calculated prior to the initiation of sleep deprivation as candidates for inclusion. On occasion, an individual fly's sleep is distributed unevenly across the 24 h day (e.g., some individuals may obtain 60-70% of their sleep quota during the day and thus only lose a small proportion of their 24 h sleep quota when deprived for 12 h at night). These flies can be evaluated separately.\nCalculate the average percentage of sleep recovered (relative to baseline) over 12 h, 24 h and 48 h of the recovery period for each genotype.\nFrom sleep data, compute the average and maximum daytime sleep bout length on baseline, and recovery days for each genotype.\n\tNOTE: Rebound sleep in flies is characterized by increased sleep amount, and increased sleep depth in the recovery days. Sleep consolidation is used as measure of sleep depth. Arousal thresholds could also be used as a measure of sleep depth.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
