    "1. Growing Cancer Spheroids\nGrowing from cell lines\nCulture human bladder cancer cells under conventional adherent cell culture conditions and maintain in a 37 °C incubator supplied with 5% CO2. Maintain cells at <90% confluency.\n\t\tNOTE: Culture media used is Dulbecco's modified minimum essential media (DMEM) containing 4.5 g/L D-glucose, L-Glutamine, 110 mg/L sodium pyruvate, and supplied with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) throughout this protocol.\nOne day prior to the start of the experiment, trypsinize (by using 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA) cells, quantify cell concentration and distribute 1 x 106 cells in 3 mL culture media in each well of a 6-well ultra-low attachment plate.\nIncubate cells in low attachment conditions at 37 °C for ≥16 h. This should allow adequate time for cells to aggregate into spheroids for most bladder cancer cell lines.\n\t\tNOTE: The formation of spheroids can be observed by inverted bright field microscope. The optimal size and number of spheroids may depend on individual experiments, but we find that spheroids with diameters from 50 µm to 150 µm are generally suitable for time-lapse imaging using a 20X objective lens.\nTo incorporate additional cell types, such as fibroblasts or immune cells into the spheroids, mix the desired cells with cancer cells at desired ratio (1:1, 1:10, etc.) in an ultra-low attachment plate and incubate at 37 °C for ≥16 h to allow formation of mixed cell type spheroids.\nGrowing from primary tumors\n\tNOTE: Tumor spheroids can also be derived from primary bladder tumor sources such as tumors developed from carcinogen-induced bladder tumor models8. For example, bladder tumors generated from mice fed with N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine (BBN), can be harvested and minced into small pieces (about 0.5 mm3) using sterile surgical instruments. Digested primary samples of human bladder cancers can also be studied in this system.",
    "Collect and wash 0.5 mm3 tumor pieces in 5 mL ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Centrifugation at 200 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Repeat this washing step once.\nCollect tumor pieces by centrifugation at 200 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant and add 5 mL of DMEM containing 10% FBS. Transfer tumor spheroid/media mixture to a 6-well ultra-low attachment plate. Incubate at 37 °C for ≥16 h before embedding into collagen matrix (see step 2.3).\n2. Preparing the 3-D culture chamber\nDilute type-1 collagen (derived from rat tail) in DMEM containing 10% FBS to make a 2 mg/mL mixture according to manufacturer's instructions.\nIn short, mix collagen with appropriate amount of 1 N NaOH solution and DMEM by gentle pipetting based upon the manufacturer's instructions to achieve physiologic pH.\nAfter mixing collagen and DMEM, quickly coat the wells of the chamber slide (for most applications, chamber slides with a number 1.5 cover-glass is optimal) with the collagen-DMEM mixture prior to solidification (200 µL/well).Allow the coated chamber slide to be stationary at room temperature for 15 min.\n\t\tNOTE: The composition of collagen-based matrix can be modified by adding other extracellular matrix ingredients, such as fibronectin or laminin, according to the purposes of experiment.\nGently pipet 500 µL of media containing spheroids (or tumor pieces, if primary tumor sample is used) from the 6-well ultra-low attachment plate into an empty 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Wait for 2 min to let the spheroids settle to the bottom of the tube.\nCarefully remove the supernatant from the tube. Prepare another tube of type-1 collagen (2 mg/mL) mixed with DMEM containing 10% FBS and quickly add 500 µL of this mixture to the spheroids. Gently mix the spheroids and collagen by slow pipetting.",
    "Add 250 µL of spheroids/collagen mixture to a well of collagen-pre-coated chamber slide. Allow the collagen matrix containing spheroids to solidify completely (about 30 min at 37 °C).\nAfter the collagen matrix is solidified, add 1 mL of DMEM containing 10% FBS to each well (Figure 1B). Incubate the chamber slide in a 37 °C incubator supplied with 5% CO2 until ready for imaging.\n3. Live Cell Time-lapse Imaging\nTurn on the confocal microscope following the manufacturer's instructions and ensure that the climate chamber reaches 37 °C and is supplied with 5% CO2.\n\tNOTE: Our microscope and chamber usually require 1 h to reach system equilibrium.\nCarefully transfer the chamber slide to the slide adaptor attached to the microscope.\nLocate the spheroids of interest using a low power objective (e.g., 5X) and start imaging with the higher power objective (in current protocol, 20X objective is used for most of the live cell imaging for its better image quality).\n\tNOTE: For primary bladder tumor samples, 5X and 10X objectives may be needed in order to cover larger imaging area. For our time-lapse imaging, the imaging interval is set as 30 min and a Z stack is used to image the whole spheroid. Typically the distance between Z-slices is set to 4 µm for the 20X objective, and the total distance of Z axis is around 200 µm. Images can be obtained using DIC and with fluorescence if cells/tissues harbor fluorescent protein markers.\nPerform time-lapse imaging for 24–72 h.\n\tNOTE: The duration is determined by the cell type and the needs of the experiment.\n4. Preparation of Sample Block Containing Cancer Spheroids for Frozen Tissue Sectioning",
    "Carefully lift the block of collagen gel and spheroids from the chamber slides by using small forceps. Place the collagen gel block in a plastic histology mold.\nRinse the collagen gel with 1x PBS briefly, and then fix it with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature.\n\tCAUTION: PFA is potential carcinogen and should be handled with care.\nWash the collagen gel with 1.5 mL of 1x PBS on a shaker for 15 min. Replace the PBS and repeat the previous washing step 3x.\nApply a thin layer (about 3 mm) of optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound to cover the bottom of a new plastic histology mold. Place the fixed and washed collagen gel on top of the OCT compound, then carefully embed the whole gel by filling the mold with OCT compound while avoiding the formation of any air bubbles in the OCT.\nLeave the mold at 4 °C for 1 h.\nPlace the mold containing the sample and OCT compound on a 100 mm Petri dish floating on liquid nitrogen. Allow the sample to flash-freeze completely.\nStore the frozen sample block at -80 °C for future use.\n5. Immunofluorescence Imaging for Frozen Sectioned Cancer Spheroids\nTransfer the frozen sample block from the -80 °C freezer to the -20 °C chamber of a cryostat.\nPerform conventional frozen sectioning by setting the section interval to 7 µm. Let sectioned samples attach to the glass slide without wrinkles or trapped air.\nStore the slides at -80 °C before performing further staining.\n\t\tNOTE: Different intervals may be used to fit experimental needs.\nAir dry the slides for 1 h at room temperature.\nPermeabilize the samples with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min.\nWash samples 3x with PBS for 10 min per wash.",
    "Encircle the samples on the slide with hydrophobic barriers by using a hydrophobic barrier pen.\nTreat the samples with blocking solution (1x PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)), for 1 h at room temperature.\nApply 40 µL of primary antibody-containing solution (1x PBS containing 5% BSA with 1:100 dilution of primary antibody) to each sample on the slide.\nIncubate the slides in primary antibody at 37 °C for 1 h or at room temperature overnight (the incubation time and conditions vary depending on primary antibody).\nWash samples 3x with PBS for 15 min (per wash).\nApply 40 µL of secondary antibody-containing solution (1x PBS containing 5% of BSA with 1:300 secondary antibody dilution) to each sample on the slide.\nWash samples 3x with PBS for 15 min (per wash).\nStain the samples with Hoechst 33342 solution (1 µg/mL, diluted in PBS) at room temperature for 10 min. Then wash samples with PBS for 5 min.\nMount the samples with mounting medium and cover them with appropriately sized cover slips. Leave the slides in dark at room temperature for 24 h and then perform confocal microscopy.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
