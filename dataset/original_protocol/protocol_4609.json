    "Skeletal myogenic primingFor cells not natively committed to skeletal myogenesis (for example, cells isolated from non-muscle organs), a priming step may facilitate myogenic differentiation in vitro. To prime cells of interest for skeletal myogenesis, cells are plated on collagen type-I coated plates at low density (2 x 103 cells/cm2) for 5-7 days with muscle proliferation medium.Medium should be completely changed every 2 days. To further increase their myogenic efficiency, passage cells by typical trypsinization for 5 min at 37 °C and then repeat the priming step one or more times.Skeletal myogenic differentiationFor human cells, cells are plated on collagen type-I coated 24- or 48-well plates at high confluency (>2.5 x 104 cells/cm2) for 7-14 days with human muscle fusion (myogenic) medium: DMEM high-glucose supplemented with 1% FBS, 1% HS, 0.5% CEE, and 1% P/S. Half of the fusion medium is renewed every 2-3 days until elongated, multinucleated skeletal myofibers appear (Crisan et al., 2008). For mouse cells, cells near or at confluency (>1.5 x 104 cells/cm2) are cultured for 3-7 days in mouse muscle fusion (myogenic) medium: DMEM high-glucose supplemented with 2% FBS and 1% P/S. Half of the fusion medium is renewed every 2 days until elongated, multinucleated skeletal myofibers appear (Lu et al., 2014). For human and mouse cells not tolerating sudden switch to low-serum fusion media with resultant cell death, skeletal myogenesis can be induced by gradually lowering serum concentration from 20% to 2% (for example, 20%-10%-5%-2%, each stage for 3-7 days) until elongated, multinucleated skeletal myofibers appear. A positive myogenic cell control (e.g., skeletal myoblast) can be included in the experiment with cells of interest to confirm the efficacy of myogenic media. Skeletal myofiber detectionSkeletal myogenic differentiation can be first identified by the distinct morphology of elongated, multinucleated skeletal myofibers (Figure 1).",
    "To precisely determine the myogenic differentiation, immunofluorescent staining for muscle cell markers: desmin (early myogenesis), fast- and slow-myosin heavy chain (fast- and slow-MyHC; mature myogenesis) is performed. For human cells, 7-14 days after culturing in muscle fusion medium, cells are rinsed two times with DPBS and then fixed for 5 min in cold methanol/acetone mixture (1:1, -20 °C) (Chen et al., 2015). For mouse cells, 3-7 days after culturing in muscle fusion medium, cells are rinsed two times with DPBS and then fixed for 5 min in cold methanol (-20 °C) (Lu et al., 2014). Alternatively, cells can be fixed with 10% formalin for 8 min at room temperature (RT) (Sohn et al., 2015). After washing 3 times with DPBS for 5 min each, fixed cells are blocked with 10% normal donkey serum for 1-2 h and then incubated, without washing, with the primary mouse anti-desmin, mouse anti-fast-MyHC, or mouse anti-slow-MyHC antibody (diluted in 5% normal donkey serum) for 2 h at RT or at 4 °C overnight. After washing 3 times with DPBS for 5 min each, the cells are then incubated with the secondary Alexa 594-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody or Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (diluted with 5% normal donkey serum) for 30 min to 1 h at RT. After washing 3 times with DPBS for 5 min each, nuclei are stained by DAPI for 5 min. After washing 2 times with DPBS for 5 min each, stained cells can be observed using a fluorescent microscope.The percentage of differentiated myotubes can be quantified as the number of nuclei in MyHC-positive myotubes relative to the total number of nuclei. Stained cells can be preserved in sterile DPBS at 4 °C in the dark for up to 1 week.",
    "If staining background persists after washing, the primary antibody can be detected using a mouse-on-mouse (M.O.M) staining kit to reduce signal noise, according to the manufacturer's directions."
