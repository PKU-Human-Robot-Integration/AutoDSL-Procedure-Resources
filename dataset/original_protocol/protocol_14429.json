    "An Institutional Review Board approval was received from University of Arizona for conducting this study. Informed patient consent forms were obtained.\n1. Patient Selection\nNOTE: An Institutional Review Board approval was obtained from University of Arizona. A total of 38 patients were recruited. The patients' ages ranged from 32 to 86 years old with a mean of 55 years, of whom 26 patients were post-menopausal and 12 patients were pre-menopausal.\nObtain informed consent from each patient.\n2. Fallopian Tube Cells Collection Procedure\nNOTE: The patients included in the current study were all scheduled for total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for either prophylactic risk reduction or malignancy. The details of surgery were unknown for pathologist who performed the cytology study.\nImmediately after surgical excision, examine the fresh tissue specimen including uterus, bilateral ovaries, and bilateral fallopian tubes carefully to identify the bilateral fallopian tube.\nCollect and place fallopian tube cells into the preservative solution (see Table of Materials) vial within 30 min of clamping the blood supply; the recommended preservative is a methanol-based, buffered preservative solution.\n\tNOTE: Use a gentle touch brush for the tubal cell collection (upcoming steps). With the exception of rare cases in which the fallopian tube is submitted detached from the uterus, inserting a brush head to collect cells from the tubal fimbria occurs typically when the fallopian tube is attached to the uterus.\n\t\nWith the help of a small forceps, insert the brush (see Table of Materials) into the lumen of the fallopian tube through the fimbriae end. Slowly rotate clockwise and move the brush forward through the infundibular portion of the fallopian tube, then the ampulla until it reaches the isthmus.",
    "Slowly rotate and reverse the brush counter-clockwise to pull out the brush. Ensure that the maximal speed of the brush within the lumen is slower than 1 cm/s.\nRinse the brush in the preservative solution (in a vial) by rotating and swirling the brush 10 times in the solution.\nTighten the vial cap.\nRecord the patient's information and the laterality of the specimen.\nStore the vial in a 4 °C refrigerator (for up to) 6 months.\n3. Tubal Cytology Slide Preparation\nLoad the sample vial into the automated processor for slide preparation.\n\tNOTE: We use the automated processor for slide preparation. The following steps are performed automatically after the sample vial is placed into the processor: (i) The cells and debris are separated and dispersed through the rotation of the test filter within the sample vial. (ii) Tubal cells are collected from the exterior surface of the filter by a gentle vacuum. (iii) The filter is inverted and pressed against the slide to let the cells to adhere to the circular area within the slide. (iv) The slide is further fixed in a cell fixative bath and ready for staining and cytology analysis. Unfortunately, there is no alternative manual method, which can yield results with a similar quality.\n4. Modified Papanicolaou Staining Protocol\nStain the slides made from step 3.1 by running the automatized non-gyn stain procedure, as illustrated in Table 1.",
    "NOTE: The staining method represents a modification of the Papanicolaou staining technique that we use routinely for non-gynecologic specimens. We use an automated tissue processor to stain some slides. We chose the Non-Gyn staining procedure over the Gyn staining procedure in this study. The Eosin used is EA-65, instead of the EA-50 used for gynecological specimens (Pap smear specimen). In addition, OG-6 in the Gyn staining procedure, which is mainly for squamous cell staining, is not included in the staining procedure since no squamous cells are expected to be seen in this study. EA65 (Eosin Azure) is a counter stain solution comprised of 3 dyes: Eosin Y, Fast green FCF, and Bismarck brown Y. The procedure is illustrated in Table 1.\nPerform a manual quick Pap stain procedure as follows.\nDip the slide made in step 3.1 into 95% ethanol, 10 times, with each dip taking about 1 s.\nDip the slide into H2O, 10 times, with each dip taking about 1 s.\nEmerge the slide in hematoxylin for 10 - 60 s.\nDip the slide into H2O, 10 times, with each dip taking about 1 s.\nDip the slide into 95% ethanol, 10 times, with each dip taking about 1 s.\nEmerge the slide in EA65 for 1 - 3 min.\nDip the slide into H2O, 10 times, with each dip taking about 1 s.\nDip the slide into 95% ethanol, 10 times, with each dip taking about 1 s.\nDip the slide in xylene until the slide becomes clear.",
    "NOTE: This is a modified Papanicolaou staining procedure. This method is used as a more rapid stain method for cases with limited time or space like on-site fine needle aspiration and STAT specimens. This procedure provides comparable quality staining as the automatized Non-Gyn stain procedure. The procedure is illustrated in Table 2.\n5. Spin Cells onto Slides\nNOTE: Three cytospin slides are made for each specimen. One slide is H&E stained for the morphological comparison with the cytology slide. Two unstained slides were made for the future IHC staining study. The detailed steps of this section are not the focus of this paper; therefore, we will not discuss them in extended details.\nPrepare a cytocentrifuge with a labeled slide, specimen funnel and filter for each sample to be examined.\nConcentrate the cells by centrifuging for 5 min at 200 x g.\nRemove about half of the supernatant and then re-suspend the cells by gentle pipetting.\nAdd 200 µL of each cell suspension to a specimen funnel.\nSpin at 250 x g for 5 min. Carefully remove the slide(s) from the cytocentrifuge and transfer them to 95% Ethanol for fixation.\nAir dry prior to staining and for long term storage.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the cell density on the final slides, step 5.2 and step 5.3 can be skipped or adjusted. In this study, we require at least 2 cell clusters present per high power view for adequate cellular density.\n6. Sectioning and Extensively Examining the Fimbriated End (SEE-FIM) Protocol\nFix the entire specimen (including uterus, bilateral fallopian tubes, and ovaries) in 10% formalin prior to grossing to minimize exfoliation.",
    "Gently and carefully detach the fallopian tubes from the uterus at the isthmus using small forceps and a scissors. If adhesion is present, carefully dissect the fimbriated end from the ovary surface using small forceps and a scissors; these steps are crucial to minimize tumor cross contamination between ovary and fallopian tube due to their intimate proximity.\nAmputate the infundibulum and fimbriae segment (the distal 1.0 - 2.0 cm of fallopian tube) from the rest of the specimen.\nSection the infundibulum and fimbriae longitudinally at 2 mm intervals. Submit all sections in toto for histologic examination.\nSection the isthmus and ampulla at 2 - 3 mm intervals and submit entirely.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
