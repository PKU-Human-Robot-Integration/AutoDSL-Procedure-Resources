    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMost models of experimental liver carcinogenesis use mice. However, they common lack the typical features of chronic human liver disease that promote HCC development such as chronic injury, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. In humans, HCC develops in a chronically injured liver in 80% of the cases. In addition, mice develop HCCs with a low incidence when treated with DEN (Heindryckx et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nChronic administration of DEN in rats causes liver tumors with a sequential progression of hepatitis, cirrhosis, and tumor formation. Comparing to the 34% of induction rate for mice, recent studies demonstrated that Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats treated with 10 weekly doses of DEN (70 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally) develop HCC with up to 80% (CavigLia and Schwabe, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). This DEN-induced rat HCC model closely mimics the development of human liver cancer, which typically involve sequential stimuli for initiation and progression (Magee and Barnes, 1956[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). This protocol is aimed to generate a genotoxic hepatocarcinogenesis model in rats (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/487-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic overview of the experimental course of DEN-induced liver cancer rat model\nCohorts of SD male rats were either injected intraperitoneally with a dosage of 70 mg/kg DEN or sterile isotonic saline once per week for 10 weeks. Rats were sacrificed from cohorts of hepatitis, cirrhosis, and HCC in 5, 14, and 24 weeks, respectively. w, week.\nInduction of chronic liver injury and inflammation in rats\nTiming: 6 weeks\nReagent setup, labeling, weight measurements, and injections of DEN solution usually do not take more than 2 h. Inflammatory infiltration can be detected at the fourth to fifth week after the first DEN administration.\nPut three rats in one cage and label the rats with ear markings or other similar methods.\nKeep rats on a basal diet for one week.",
    "Weigh the rats and calculate the amount of DEN needed.\nPrepare as many aliquots of DEN working solution as necessary (70 mg per kg body weight, i.e., 180 μL working solution per 180 g rat body weight).\nTightly hold the rat in a vertical position. Place the body of the rat straight and catch the head with thumb and index finger. While holding the rat with one hand, apply with the other hand. Inject intraperitoneally DEN working solution for the experimental group (including hepatitis, cirrhosis, and carcinoma groups) or sterile isotonic saline for the control group using a 1 mL insulin syringe in a laminar airflow hood.\nNote: DEN may cause cancer and heritable genetic damage. Wear suitable protective clothing, gloves and face/eye protection. All handling, particularly the i.p. injections, should be performed in a laminar airflow hood.\nNote: Avoid bubbles in the syringe.\nCritical: Ensure that the position of the rat is secured before inserting the insulin syringe. It is essential to ensure that the appropriate dose of DEN solution are injected completely into abdominal cavity (see Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nPut the rat back to the original cage with the regular diets, and closely monitor the health condition of the rat every day or every other day.\nRepeat steps 3–6 at day 15 of the experiment.\nRepeat steps 3–6 at day 22 of the experiment.\nRepeat steps 3–6 at day 29 of the experiment.\nRepeat steps 3–6 at day 36 of the experiment.",
    "Critical: DEN is very reliable in inducing liver carcinoma with high reproducibility and low mortality. However, sometimes the rats that are too young or too low in body weight or highly susceptible to DEN may die in the first few weeks after DEN treatment. Determination of weight every day or every other day is important to get an idea of hepatitis severity. If the weight is <90% of the initial weight, this is an indication that rat should be omitted from further experimentation, or dose of DEN may be decreased in subsequent experiments (see Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nAt day 36 of the experiment, rats from hepatitis group were sacrificed with 1.5% (wt/vol) pentobarbital sodium (30 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection.\nPlace rats on the dissection tray and secure limbs using strings (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/487-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Rats positioning on the dissection tray\nThe sacrificed rat is placed on the center of the dissection tray with its limbs and head secured with strings.\nUsing forceps and scissors, open the abdominal cavity and dissect out the liver carefully.\nRemove the entire liver using an anatomical forceps and a scalpel or scissors, and place the liver in a 10 cm Petri dish filled with PBS.\nNote: Avoid to bruise the liver, holding the ligaments of the liver with the forceps.\nRinse the liver with PBS twice to remove the remaining blood.\nThe entire liver of each rat was observed grossly and weighed (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/487-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

HCCs forming after 24 weeks of DEN treatment.",
    "The livers from each rats were collected and divided into pieces. Some samples of frequently used techniques are described below: Preparation for subsequent molecular biological investigations (option a) and histopathological analysis (option b).\nPreparation for molecular biological investigations (e.g., for DNA sequence analysis, RNA sequence analysis, and western blot).\nCarefully and quickly snap-frozen the liver tissue directly in liquid nitrogen.\nProceed directly with DNA, RNA or protein purification using standard procedures or stored at −80°C.\nPause Point: Extracted genomic DNA, RNA or protein can be stored long-term at −80°C for later analysis.\nHistopathological analysis\nThe remaining pieces were preserved in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin.\nEmbed in paraffin and prepare 5 μm paraffin cross-sections.\nMount the slices on glass slides.\nStain sections with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) using standard procedures.\nAssess necroinflammation, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and tumor formation by an experienced pathologist.\nInduction of fibrosis and cirrhosis in rats\nTiming: 9 weeks\nRepeat steps 3–6 at day 43 of the experiment.\nRepeat steps 3–6 at day 50 of the experiment.\nRepeat steps 3–6 at day 57 of the experiment.\nRepeat steps 3–6 at day 64 of the experiment.\nRepeat steps 3–6 at day 71 of the experiment.\nEight weeks after the first injection, liver fibrosis start to occur. At appropriate time points, the rats from selected group were sacrificed with 1.5% (wt/vol) pentobarbital sodium (30 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection. (see Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nRepeats steps 12–17 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).",
    "Critical: When you establish the HCC model for the first time, include an additional subgroup of rats in order to confirm the sequential progression state of the liver. Sacrifice rats with pentobarbital sodium, collect the livers, and fix them in neutral formalin. After embedding in paraffin, slice the paraffin block, and stain with H&E to assess liver hepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis state. Select the appropriate time points according to the assessment results and the purpose of the experiment (see Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nIn the cirrhosis models, analysis at the 14th week after the first injection may be appropriate in most cases. At this time point, nodular cirrhosis could be seen macroscopically. (see Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3])\nSpontaneous tumor progression and preparation for tumor analysis\nTiming: 10 weeks\nCarefully monitor the animals, determine the weight of the rats and watch for signs of distress.\nNote: At this time point, experimental rats should have gain of weight after DEN administration. However, if the experimental rat loss of weight and display signs of overt distress, it should be killed in time for further analysis.\nTwenty four weeks after the first injection, the rats were sacrificed with 1.5% (wt/vol) pentobarbital sodium (30 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection.\nCritical: At this time point, the experimental rats were obviously thin and small, compares with the control group. However, they were still large (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]), and showed restlessness, irritability, aggressiveness. Carefully hold the rats when doing experiments to avoid being bitten by rats.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/487-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. The growing size of rats\nThe size of rats can grow larger than our hands at the 24th week.\nPlace rats on the dissection tray and secure limbs using strings.\nUsing forceps and scissors, open the abdominal cavity and dissect out the liver carefully.",
    "Remove the entire liver using an anatomical forceps and a scalpel or scissors, and place the liver in a 10 cm Petri dish filled with PBS.\nRinse the liver with PBS twice to remove the remaining blood.\nThe entire liver of each rat was observed grossly and weighed (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nHarvest tumors and adjacent normal control tissue. (see Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nSome tissues were snap-frozen directly in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. The remaining pieces were preserved in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin for histopathologic examinations.\nProceed directly with DNA, RNA or protein purification using standard procedures or stored at −80°C.\nPause Point: Extracted genomic DNA, RNA or protein can be stored long-term at −80°C for later analysis.\nCritical: Rats receiving chronic administration of DEN develop HCC by 36 weeks with an incidence of 80%. If less than 60% of the animals develop liver carcinoma, try to extend the experiment time, even until by the time of death (see Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9])."
