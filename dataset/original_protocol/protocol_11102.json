    "The protocol follows the guidelines of Mayo Clinic's Institutional Review Board, Institutional Biosafety Committee, and Mayo Clinic's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. NIS+ BCMA-CAR T cell production\nNOTE: This protocol follows the guidelines of the Mayo Clinic's Institutional Review Board (IRB 17-008762) and Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC Bios00000006.04).\nProduction of BCMA-CAR, NIS, and luciferase-green fluorescent protein (GFP)-encoding lentiviruses.\n\tNOTE: A second-generation BCMA-CAR construct was synthesized de novo (see the Table of Materials) and cloned into a third-generation lentiviral vector under the control of an elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1α) promotor. The BCMA-CAR construct (C11D5.3-41BBz) included 4-1BB costimulation and a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) derived from an anti-human BCMA antibody clone C11D5.333,34. The NIS is under the control of the EF-1α promotor and binds to the puromycin resistance gene via self-cleaving peptides (P2A). The lentiviral vector encoding luciferase-GFP (see the Table of Materials) is used to transduce tumor cells, which then express GFP and luciferase.\n\t\nPrepare lentiviral vector plasmids: pLV-EF1α-BCMA-CAR (15 µg), pBMN-CMV-GFP-Luc2-Puro (15 µg), and pLV-EF1α-NIS-P2A-Puro (15 µg).\n\t\tNOTE: pBMN-CMV-GFP-Luc2-Puro and pLV-EF1α-NIS-P2A-Puro contain the puromycin resistance gene. Therefore, NIS- or luciferase-GFP-transduced cells can be selected with 1 µg/mL or 2 µg/mL of puromycin dihydrochloride, as described previously14,35.\nSeed 20 × 106 of 293T cells in a T175 flask and incubate for 24 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Confirm that 293T cells are evenly distributed on the flask at 70-90% confluence by direct visualization under the microscope.\nPrepare a master mix of 15 µg of the expression vector (e.g., CAR, NIS, or luciferase-GFP linear DNA), 7 µg of the envelope vector (VSV-G), and 18 µg of the packaging vector (gag, pol, rev, and tat). Dilute the DNA master mix in 4.5 mL of the transfection medium, and then add 111 µL of the pre-complexing reagent (Mixture A).",
    "Prepare a new tube, and dilute 129 µL of the liposomal transfection reagent in 4.5 mL of the transfection medium (Mixture B).\nCombine Mixtures A and B and flick the tube to mix the contents. Incubate for 30 min at room temperature (RT).\nAfter the incubation, simply aspirate the cell supernatant without detaching the cells and add 16 mL of a growth medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine. Then, add the mixture of Mixtures A and B on 293T cells dropwise. Finally, incubate the transfected cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nOn days 1 and 2 post-transfection, harvest the supernatant of 293T, spin down at 900 × g for 10 min, and filter through a 0.45 µm nylon filter. Concentrate the filtrate at 24 and 48 h by ultracentrifugation at 112,700 × g for 2 h, and freeze at -80 °C.\nEx-vivo T cell isolation (Figure 1)\n\tNOTE: Perform all cell culture work in a laminar flow cabinet using aseptic technique and personal protective equipment. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are harvested from healthy volunteer donor blood collected during apheresis36. Pathogen screening was performed on human cells used in this study.\n\t\nUse the standard density gradient technique to isolate PBMCs.\n\t\t\nGently add 15 mL of density gradient medium (density of 1.077 g/mL) (containing alpha-D-glucopyranoside, beta-D-fructofuranosyl homopolymer, and, 3-(acetylamino)-5-(acetylmethylamino)-2,4,6-triodobenzoic acid monosodium salt) to a 50 mL density gradient separation tube without creating air bubbles (see the Table of Materials).",
    "To avoid cell trapping, dilute the blood sample with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 0.2 g/L of potassium chloride, 0.2 g/L of potassium phosphate monobasic, 8 g/L of sodium chloride, and 1.15 g/L of sodium phosphate dibasic) containing 2% FBS at a 1:1 volume ratio. Gently transfer the diluted blood on top of the density gradient medium without breaking the interface between the two. Spin down at 1,200 × g for 10 min at RT.\n\t\t\tNOTE: A 50 mL density gradient separation tube can be used for the isolation of 4-17 mL of a blood sample. The 50 mL density gradient separation tube (see the Table of Materials) used in this protocol does not require the \"brake off\" during centrifugation. However, when standard 50 mL tubes are used, the brake needs to be off and requires 30 min centrifugation.\nTransfer the supernatant into a new 50 mL conical tube, wash with PBS + 2% FBS by filling up to 50 mL, and then spin down at 300 × g for 8 min at RT.\nAspirate the supernatant, and resuspend the pelleted cells in 50 mL of PBS + 2% FBS. Count the number of cells, and then spin down at 300 × g for 8 min at RT. Repeat the previous step for a total of 2 washes.\nAspirate the supernatant, and resuspend the pelleted cells to a concentration of 50 × 106 cells/mL with PBS + 2% FBS.\nPerform T cell isolation from PBMCs using a negative selection magnetic bead kit.\n\t\tNOTE: An ideal negative selection kit includes magnetic beads attached to antibodies against antigens expressed on cells other than T cells. A commonly used kit contains antibodies conjugated to magnetic beads against CD15, CD14, CD34, CD36, CD56, CD123, CD235a, CD19, and CD16 (see Table of Materials).",
    "Transfer PBMCs to a 14 mL polystyrene round-bottom tube. Then, place the PBMCs and the negative selection antibody cocktail in a fully automated cell separator, and perform T cell isolation according to the manufacturer's protocol.\nT cell stimulation and T cell expansion (Figure 1)\n\t\nTo culture the isolated T cells, prepare T cell expansion medium (TCM) made with serum-free hematopoietic cell medium supplemented with 10% human serum albumin and 1% penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine14. After T cell isolation, count the cells and culture at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/mL with TCM.\nWash anti-CD3/CD28 beads three times with TCM before culturing with T cells.\n\t\t\nMix the vial containing the beads by swirling. Then, pipette the required volume of beads (3:1 beads:cell) (e.g., when stimulating 1.0 × 106 cells of T cells, use 3.0 × 106 of anti-CD3/CD28 beads) into a sterile microcentrifuge tube (1.5 mL) and resuspend in 1 mL of TCM.\nPlace the microcentrifuge tube with the beads on a magnet for 1 min, and aspirate the supernatant. Remove the tube from the magnet, and resuspend the washed beads in 1 mL of TCM. Repeat the previous two steps for a total of 3 washes.\nResuspend the beads in 1 mL of TCM and transfer them to the T cells. Then, dilute the T cells to a final concentration of 1.0 × 106 cells/mL with TCM. Transfer the T-cell/bead suspension to a tissue-culture-treated 6-well plate and place it in the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2).\nTitration of lentiviruses (Figure 2)\n\t\nPrepare T cells for titration assay. Ensure that approximately 1.0 x 106 cells are available to titrate one type of virus.\nStimulate T cells as described in section 1.3.2.",
    "Plate 1.0 × 105 cells of stimulated T cells in a 96-well plate (titer plate) and incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h (Figure 2A). Isolate and stimulate the T cells as described in section 1.2.\nPrepare a dilution plate (96-well plate) by adding 100 µL of TCM into the wells of the designated columns and the untransduced control wells (Figure 2B).\nThaw one vial of lentiviral particles on ice and gently pipette up and down to mix well. Transfer 50 µL of the virus supernatant into the wells of Column 6 of the 96-well plate (dilution 3) (Figure 2B). Pipette up and down to mix well.\nPerform serial dilutions (2-fold serial dilution): transfer 50 µL from well A6 to well B6 and then 50 µL from well B6 to well C6; repeat until G6. Then, add 50 µL of the diluted virus to the titer plate (Figure 2B).\nIncubate the titer plate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 48 h, and determine the percentages of CAR-, NIS-, or GFP-positive cells by flow cytometry (Figure 2C).\n\t\t\nWash the wells by spinning down the titer plate two times at 650 × g at 4 °C for 3 min.\nStain the transduced T cells as described in steps 1.5.3 to 1.5.9.\nDetermine the titers based on the percentages of CAR-, NIS-, or GFP-positive cells by using formula (1):\n\t\t\tTiters = Percentage of BCMA-CAR+ or NIS+ T cells × T cell count at transduction × the specific dilution / volume (1)\nTransduction of lentiviruses and NIS+BCMA-CAR T cell expansion\n\t\nTwenty-four to 48 h after T cell stimulation, perform lentiviral transduction on stimulated T cells (T cells should form clusters).\n\t\t\nThaw the frozen lentiviruses encoding CAR or NIS at 4 °C.",
    "Mix the stimulated T cells well to break up the clusters, and simply add freshly thawed virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5.0 (when transducing 1.0 × 106 T cells, use 5.0 × 106 of lentivirons). Incubate the transduced cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nOn days 3, 4, and 5, count the transduced T cells using a hematocytometer37 or a fully automated cell counter38 and adjust the cell concentration to 1.0 × 106 cells/mL by adding fresh, pre-warmed TCM. For NIS-transduced T cells carrying the puromycin resistance gene, treat the cells with 1 µg/mL of puromycin dihydrochloride on days 3, 4, and 5.\nOn day 6, remove the anti-CD3/CD28 beads from the transduced T cells (from step 1.3.4) by mixing well to break up the T cell clusters and placing them in a magnet for 1 min. Then, simply place the collected transduced T cells back in culture at a concentration of 1.0 × 106 cells/mL. After removing the beads from the T cells, assess the expression of CAR and NIS by flow cytometry.\n\t\tNOTE: As the single-chain variable fragment of the BCMA-CAR is derived from mouse, it can be stained with goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647. NIS can be detected using anti-human ETNL [synthetic peptide corresponding to aa625-643 (SWTPCVGHDGGRDQQETNL)]. This antibody recognizes the cytosolic C-terminus of NIS. Therefore, T cells must be permeabilized before incubation with an anti-human NIS antibody.\nPerform surface staining of BCMA-CAR using goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L).",
    "Take an aliquot of the culture (e.g., 50,000 T cells) and wash with flow buffer (PBS, 1% FBS, and 1% sodium azide). Next, resuspend the cells with 50 µL of flow buffer, and stain the cells with 1 µL of goat anti-mouse antibody for detecting CAR expression and 0.3 µL of live-dead aqua for excluding dead cells.\nIncubate for 15 min in the dark at RT, wash the cells by adding 150 µL of flow buffer, and centrifuge the cells at 650 × g for 3 min at 4 °C.\nAfter surface CAR staining, fix and permeabilize the cells by adding 100 µL of fixation medium (PBS with 4.21% formaldehyde) and incubate for 20 min at 4 °C. Wash the cells twice with 100 µL of a buffer that contains a cell-permeabilizing agent such as saponin (650 × g for 3 min at 4 °C).\nResuspend the fixed/permeabilized cells in 50 µL of a permeabilizing buffer. Then, add 0.3 ng of anti-human ETNL NIS antibody in 50 µL of flow buffer and incubate for 1 h at 4 °C.\nAdd 150 µL of flow buffer, and centrifuge the cells at 650 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. Incubate the cells with 2.5 µL of anti-rabbit secondary antibody in 50 µL of flow buffer for 30 min at 4 °C, wash the cells by adding 150 µL of flow buffer, and centrifuge at 650 × g for 3 min at 4 °C.\nFinally, resuspend in 200 µL of flow buffer and perform flow cytometry to determine the transduction efficiency (Figure 3A,B).",
    "On day 8, count and spin down the T cells at 300 × g for 8 min at 4 °C. Resuspend the T cells with freezing medium (90% FBS + 10% dimethylsulfoxide [DMSO]) at a concentration of 10 × 106/mL, then transfer 1 mL each to labeled cryovials.\nPlace the vials in a -80 °C freezer for 48 h. After 48 h (and by day 10), transfer the T cells to liquid nitrogen.\n\t\tNOTE: See Figure 1 for the overview of NIS+ CAR T cell production. Figure 3D represents examples of ex vivo T cell expansion from three different donors.\n2. NIS+ BCMA-CAR T cell imaging with [ 18F]TFB-PET scan\nNOTE: This protocol follows the guidelines of Mayo Clinic's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC A00001767-16), IRB, and IBC (Bios00000006.04). OPM-2 is a BCMA+ MM cell line, which is often used as a target cell line for BCMA-CAR T cells39,40.\nEstablish luciferase+ BCMA+ OPM-2 cells.\n\t\nSeed 500,000 OPM-2 cells in a tissue culture-treated 24-well plate. Thaw lentivirus encoding luciferase-GFP at 4 °C.\nAdd the freshly thawed virus at an MOI of 3.0 to OPM-2 cells and mix well by pipetting. Place the plate in the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2).\nForty-eight hours after the transduction, add 2 µg/mL of puromycin to select the transduced cells. Four days after the transduction, assess the GFP-positive cells (luciferase-positive) by flow cytometry (Figure 3E).\nEstablish BCMA+ OPM-2 xenograft mouse models (Figure 4).\n\t\nCount luciferase+ OPM-2 cells and spin them down twice to remove all cell culture medium. Resuspend the OPM-2 cells at a concentration of 10 × 106 cells/mL with PBS.\nOn day -21, inject 100 µL (1.0 × 106 cells) of luciferase+ OPM-2 cells into the tails of 8-to-12-week-old immunocompromised NOD-scid IL2rγnull (NSG) mice (Figure 4).",
    "On day 20 after the OPM-2 cell injection (day -1 of CAR T cell injection), check the tumor burden via bioluminescence imaging (BLI) (Figure 4).\n\t\tNOTE: OPM-2 cells form a slow-growing tumor, which usually takes 2-3 weeks to engraft.\nAdminister 10 µL/g of D-luciferin to OPM-2 xenograft mice via intraperitoneal (IP) injection. After 10 min, perform BLI on the mice under 2% isoflurane gas (Figure 5A). After confirming tumor engraftment, randomize the mice according to the tumor burden.\nOn day -1 of the CAR T cell injection, thaw NIS+BCMA-CAR T cells, and remove the freezing medium by centrifugation (300 × g, 8 min, 4 °C). Then, the resuspend cells with TCM at 2.0 × 106 cells/mL and incubate overnight (37 °C, 5% CO2).\nOn day 0, count and centrifuge the NIS+BCMA-CAR T cells (300 × g, 8 min, 4 °C). Resuspend the NIS+BCMA-CAR T cells at 50 × 106 cells/mL with PBS.\nAdminister 100 µL (5.0 × 106 cells) of NIS+BCMA-CAR T cells via tail vein injection to the OPM-2 xenograft mice. On days 7 and 15, image the mice using a PET scan.\nNIS+BCMA-CAR T cell in vivo imaging using BCMA+OPM-2 xenograft mouse model.\n\t\nWeigh the mice before the imaging, and remove any metal ear tags to eliminate metal-related artifacts.\nPrepare [18F]TFB as previously described41.\n\t\tNOTE: [18F]TFB must be produced the day of its use. Radiochemical purity should be >99% and molar activity >5 GBq/mmol.\nInject 9.25 MBq [18F]TFB intravenously via tail vein injection. Allow an uptake period of ~40 min for the radiotracer to be distributed in the body and clear the blood.\nAnesthetize the mouse using isoflurane inhalation (2%).\n\t\tNOTE: Isoflurane is the preferred inhaled anesthetic as it has rapid and reliable onset and recovery.",
    "Prior to anesthetizing the mouse, clean all surfaces of the anesthesia machine with disinfectant cleaners.\nPlace the mouse inside the induction chamber. Turn the vaporizer dial to 2% and wait for the mouse to become recumbent and non-responsive within 1-2 min.\nMonitor the mouse to avoid insufficient anesthesia or excessive depression of respiratory functions. In brief, pinch toe to confirm the insufficient anesthesia.\n\t\tNOTE: The normal respiratory rate is up to 180/min, and the acceptable drop rate is 50%.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to avoid corneal drying and trauma.\nAcquire PET/CT images 45 min post-injection with the anesthetized mouse in a micro PET/CT imaging workstation (see the Table of Materials). Next, acquire static PET images for 15 min followed by CT image acquisition for 5 min with 360° rotation and 180 projections at 500 µA, 80 keV, and 200 ms exposure.\nAnalyzing acquired imaging data\n\t\nAnalyze the images using PET image processing software (Figure 5B and Supplemental Video S1).\nDefine the volume of interest (VOI).\nCalculate the standardized uptake value (SUV) using formula (2).\n\t\tSUV in VOI = Concentration of activity in VOI (MBq/mL) × body weight (g) / administered dose (MBq)  (2)\nConfirmation of NIS+BCMA-CAR T cell trafficking to the tumor sites with the flow cytometry\n\t\nAfter [18F]TFB-PET imaging, place the mouse back into the cage. Following cessation of anesthesia, monitor the animals until they are capable of purposeful movement and ensure that they have access to food and water.\nMonitor the mice until the decay of the injected [18F]TFB. Once the radioisotope is not detectable, euthanize the mice with CO2.\nTo euthanize, place the mice into the cage (no more than 5 mice per cage).\nExpose the mice to CO2 until complete cessation of breathing in approximately 5-10 min.",
    "NOTE: This euthanasia method must be consistent with the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals (2020 Edition).\nTo ensure the death of the mice, perform cervical dislocation by grasping the back of the head and the base of the tail of the animal, then pulling hands apart/away from each other.\nHarvest the bone marrow to confirm that the NIS+BCMA-CAR T cells efficiently traffic to the tumor site.\nTransfer the harvested femurs and tibia to a 6-well plate containing 5 mL of cell culture medium. Remove the muscles and tendons from the femurs and tibia, and simply cut both ends (above the joints) of the femurs and tibia.\nFill an insulin syringe with the cell culture medium, and flush bone marrow onto the 6-well plate. For femurs, use 22 G needles and 5 mL syringes because the femur diameter is larger than that of the tibia.\nUse the flat end of the plunger to grind the bone marrow. Place a 70 µm cell strainer on a sterile 50 mL conical tube, and filter the ground bone marrow. Then, fill up the tube with the flow buffer, and centrifuge the tube at 300 × g for 8 min at 4 °C.\nAspirate the supernatant, and resuspend the bone marrow with 5 mL of flow buffer. Transfer 200 µL of bone marrow to a 96-well plate. Centrifuge the plate at 300 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. Decant the supernatant, and resuspend the cells with 50 µL of flow buffer.\nStain the bone marrow with flow antibodies against 0.25 µg of mouse CD45, 0.03 µg of human CD45, 0.06 µg of human CD3, 0.24 µg of human BCMA, and 0.3 µL of live/dead aqua. Incubate the plate for 15 min at RT in the dark.",
    "Centrifuge the plate at 300 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. Then, add 200 µL of flow buffer, and run on the flow cytometer (Figure 5C).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
