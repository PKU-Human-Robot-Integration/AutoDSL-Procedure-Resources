Also, pipette tips should be pre-wetted 3 times with a 5% serum-containing medium before pipetting mammary epithelial cells.\nPrepare Collagenase Type III, Dispase II and DNase I stock solutions as indicated in preparation of reagents and solutions[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.1].\nDissection of mammary fat pads:\nEuthanize one mouse at a time using laboratory standard procedures (e.g., carbon dioxide chamber), and as approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\nGenerously spray the ventral side of the mouse with 70% ethanol and rub against the hair to ensure the skin is thoroughly wiped.\nTransfer the mouse into a biosafety cabinet.\nPlace the mouse on a clean tray, and tape/pin the feet to expose the ventral side up.\nUsing clean tools cut one ventral midline from the inguinal nipples towards the thoracic nipples, along the skin and without cutting the peritoneum. Make two lateral incisions from the central midline towards each side of the mouse flanks, left and right, then lift and peel the skin to expose the inguinal (4th and 5th pairs) mammary fat pads (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/959-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Dissociation of mammary fad pads\n(A) Anatomy of mammary fat pads (MFPs) from a C57BL/6J wild-type mouse, with the 4th right MFP displaying the inguinal lymph node (LN), encircled.\n(B) A pair of MFPs (4th pair, left and right) is laid on a 100 mm dish and minced through vertical and horizontal cuts (black dotted lines) using a razor blade.\n(C) Image showing appearance of optimally minced MFPs.\n(D) Minced MFPs are enzymatically digested with Digestion medium I to release mammary fragments.",
    "(E) After centrifugation, a pellet containing mammary fragments plus stromal tissue (white layer), and red blood cells (RBC, red layer) is visible at the bottom of the tube.\n(F) After RBC lysis, a white cell pellet containing mammary fragments is collected. On the top right corner, references to experimental steps described in the main text.\nLocate the lymph nodes within the mammary fat pads and use a pair of forceps to squeeze and remove them. This will minimize contamination from immune cells (See note).\nUsing clean scissors and tweezers, cut and remove the inguinal fat pads from each side of the mouse flank and place them in a 100 mm tissue culture dish, containing 5 mL of basal DMEM/F12 medium (+ 5% FBS), at room temperature. From now on, only use sterile and tissue-culture grade reagents and plastics (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nQuickly proceed with the remaining mice and collect all mammary fat pads up to this point.\nNote: Dissecting tools (scissors, tweezers, and forceps) should be autoclaved or left submerged in 100% ethanol for 30 minutes (min), in a tissue culture hood before use.\nNote: It is preferable to maintain mammary fat pads at 20°C–25°C in DMEM/F12 medium (+ 5% FBS) and not on ice, while collecting remaining samples. This will reduce thermal damage to cells and proteins caused by repeated changes in temperatures, i.e. from ∼37oC mouse body temperature to ice-temperature (∼4°C), and from ice-temperature to 37oC for enzymatic digestions.\nNote: All mammary fat pads can be used to purify mammary epithelial cells. However, inguinal mammary fat pads (4th and 5th pairs) have fewer lymph nodes and blood vessels than thoracic mammary fat pads, and are a preferable source of mammary epithelial cells.\nIsolation of mammary epithelial fragments:",
    "Note: The following steps are performed at 20°C–25°C in a tissue culture hood, unless otherwise specified, and refer to freshly collected tissue. Organoids can be also derived from frozen samples (Walsh et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]).\nHolding mammary fat pads with tweezers, dip each of them into a conical tube containing 30 mL of PBS-1× and rinse off hairs and blood, if present. Use fresh PBS-1× per mouse.\nPlace two pairs of fat pads from the same mouse on a fresh 100 mm dish, and mince the glands using a sterile razor blade. Hold the razor vertically and perform perpendicular cuts, alternating vertical and horizontal cuts (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). Mince two pairs of fat pads at the time for 3 min, in order to obtain a homogeneous tissue mixture with minimal cellular damage (See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]-problem 1 and Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nTransfer minced tissue from the same mouse into a 50 mL tube containing 10 mL of Digestion medium I; shake at 200 rpm in a 37°C orbital shaker for 40 min.\nAt the end of the digestion, vortex the tube for 5 s at medium speed, then transfer the content into a clean 15 mL tube (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nNote: Pre-warm the Digestion medium I in a 37°C waterbath. 10 mL of Digestion medium I are sufficient to digest and isolate epithelial cells from 4 mammary fat pads collected from one single mouse, e.g. 4th–5th pairs. Longer digestions (e.g. 5 additional min) may be needed for 129 mouse strains. Also, volume and times of digestion should be scaled according to the number of mammary fat pads digested.",
    "Note: Single mammary fat pads from C57BL/6J mice, irrespective of their anatomical location, contain a sufficient number of mammary epithelial cells (∼80,000 cells) to establish organoid lines. Larger mammary fat pads, e.g. 4th pair, can also be divided in two parts where one half can be used for mammary organoid extraction, and the other half to perform additional analyses, e.g. pathological assessment, immunostaining.\nEnrichment of mammary fragments:\nCentrifuge the 15 mL tube at 450 × g for 10 min. A white layer containing fat should be visible at the top (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nTransfer the supernatant, including the fat layer, into a new collecting tube, and keep aside.\nNote: The supernatant can be re-digested in case of low fragments yield (See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]-Problem 1).\nTap and flick the centrifuged tube to dislodge the tissue pellet at the bottom.\nResuspend pellet in 5 mL of fresh basal DMEM/F12 medium (+ 5% FBS); this will also stop the enzymatic digestion.\nClose the lid and invert the tube a few times to mix the solution.\nTransfer 1 mL of tissue suspension into a well of a 24-well plate and observe the digested tissue under a bright field microscope (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/959-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Representative images of mammary fragments isolated from mammary fat pads (MFPs)\n(A) Poor isolation of mammary fragments (black arrow heads) is obtained with insufficient mincing and/or digestion. Few mammary fragments are found interspersed in Digestion medium I together with few terminal end buds (red arrow heads) and undigested stroma (blue arrows).\n(B) Bright field microscopy image showing complete MFP digestion after incubation with Digestion medium I. MFP are fully digested and mammary fragments released. Inset shows appearance of isolated mammary fragments.\nScale bar = 100 μm (A, B, zoom-in image).",
    "Note: Verify that at least hundreds fragments have been isolated after digestion I, i.e. with Digestion medium I (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]), and before proceeding to the next step. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] if too few epithelial fragments (Problem 1) or large amounts of stromal fragments (Problem 2) are visible.\nTransfer the 1 mL suspension of mammary fragments from the 24-well back into the centrifuge tube and combine with the remaining 4 mL of suspension.\nRinse the wells with 1 mL of basal DMEM/F12 medium (+5% FBS) to collect any residual fragments, and combine them with the 5 mL from step g.\nNote: A layer of red blood cells (RBC) can be found at the bottom of the pellet. If no RBC are present, skip to Step n.\nCentrifuge the tube at 450 × g for 5 min.\nAspirate and discard the supernatant.\nTap and flick the tube to dislodge the tissue pellet and expose the red blood cells.\nAdd 2 mL of RBC lysis buffer and incubate for 1 min at 20°C–25°C.\nAdd 8 mL of PBS-1× (+1% FBS) to dilute the RBC lysis buffer and pipet up and down a few times.\nNote: A low-speed centrifugation (Step 4.n) will separate the dissociated stromal and dead cells at the top of the suspension, while enriching for the desired epithelial fragments in the white pellet at the bottom.\nCentrifuge the tube at 200 × g for 1 min (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nAspirate and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 2 mL of TrypLE and digest the pellet containing fragments for 5 min in a 37°C waterbath.\nAdd 6 mL of PBS-1× (+ 1% FBS) to stop the enzymatic reactions, close the lid and invert the tube 3–4 times, and then spin at 450 × g for 5 min.",
    "Aspirate supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 2 mL of Digestion medium II. Place the tube in a 37°C waterbath for 5 min.\nNote: Pre-warm TrypLE and Digestion medium II in a 37°C waterbath prior use. 2 mL of Digestion medium II is enough for 2 pairs of mammary fat pads.\nNote: To aid cell dissociation, tap and invert the tube a few times every minute during the incubation Steps (p) and (r).\nNote: If single cell isolation is required, such as for flow cytometric analyses, extend the enzymatic digestion in Step (p) and (r) to 10 min. Additional steps are included as Alternatives at the bottom of the section for samples preparation for flow cytometry.\nAdd 6 mL of 0.1% FBS in PBS and invert the tube 3–4 times. Centrifuge the sample at 450 × g for 5 min.\nAspirate supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet (containing aggregates) in 1 mL of Organoid culture medium.\nPipette 20 μL of aggregates suspension into a well containing 20 μL of trypan blue and count the numbers of cell aggregates using a hemocytometer.\nNote: Mammary fragments obtained after enzymatic digestions (Step 4.r) are referred to as cell aggregates (<10 cells).\nNote: On average ∼500,000 cell aggregates, between epithelial and stromal cells, are obtained from 4 fat pads (4th and 5th pairs) from a 10–12 weeks old female mouse.\nNote: High concentration of FBS in washing solutions can be detrimental to the viability of primary epithelial cells, therefore it is recommended to progressively reduce the concentration of FBS from 5% to 0.1% when resuspending cell pellets. A reduced percentage of FBS, i.e. 0.1%, is however still required to maximize cell recovery during centrifugations.",
    "Alternatives: To generate mammary organoids from fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS)-sorted, single cell populations of mammary epithelial cells, i.e., luminal and basal, perform the following steps before plating:\nAfter step 4.s, resuspend cell pellet at 1 × 106 cells per 100 μL of FACS buffer (1% FBS in PBS-1×) and incubate at 20°C–25°C for 20 min with diluted fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies directed at lineage markers: CD31, CD45, TER119, EpCAM and CD49f in 1.5 mL tubes.\nWash cells with 1 mL of FACS buffer twice, centrifuge at 500 × g for 3 min.\nResuspend each cell pellet in 200 μL of FACS buffer containing 1 μg/mL DAPI in FACS compatible tubes. Samples are ready for cell sorting (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/959-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Organoids derived from FACS-sorted mammary epithelial cells. Mammary cells were dissociated following experimental steps included in this protocol, up to step 4.s. and steps in Alternatives\n(A) Cells were then stained with EpCAM and CD49f to distinguish between luminal and basal epithelial cell populations. P1 gate (green) indicates epithelial cells, whereas red dots represent stromal cells.\n(B) Sorted luminal and basal cells were counted, plated in Matrigel domes, and let grow into organoids. Representative images showing organoid colonies after 18 days of culture are provided. Three different types of organoid colonies can be identified and are generally referred to as solid colonies (left), cystic colonies with bright reflection (middle), and budding colonies with protruding cells (right) (Jamieson et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nScale bar = 50 μm.\nCollect sorted cells and plate as described below.\nCulturing of mammary epithelial cells in Matrigel\nTiming: 1 h\nNote: Mammary organoid colonies plated in 24-well plates will require ∼one-week time to become confluent before they can be passaged (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/959-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Mammary organoid colonies at Day 6 of culture",
    "(A) Image of murine mammary organoids ready to be passaged.\n(B) Mammary organoid shown at higher magnification.\nScale bar = 200 μm (A) and 50 μm (B).\nCoating of 24-well plates before plating:\nThaw Matrigel (in a 4°C cold room on ice for 14–16 h, or on ice at 20°C–25°C for 1–2 h) (See preparation of reagents and solutions[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.1], point 4). 10 μL of Matrigel will be used to coat each well of a 24-well plate.\nWet pipette tips with pre-chilled PBS-1× and mix the Matrigel solution by pipetting up and down 4–5 times before use.\nOpen and place the required number of 24-well plates in the tissue culture hood.\nPipette 10 μL of Matrigel in the center of each well to form a flat layer of ∼1 cm in diameter, and then transfer them to a 37oC cell incubator for 10 min.\nNote: The Matrigel coating layer will prevent mammary epithelial cells from adhering to the bottom of the plate where they would grow in 2D-monolayer. Regular tissue culture grade can be used instead of ultra-low attachment plates.\nPlating mammary organoids: After counting the overall number of isolated cell aggregates, proceed with plating. Once plated, mammary organoids are maintained in a humidified cell incubator at 37oC and 5% CO2.\nFor each well of a 24-well plate, pipette a volume of cell suspension containing 30,000 cell aggregates, and transfer them into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube containing 9 times the volume of Matrigel. For example, 5 μL of cell suspension in 45 μL of Matrigel would generate a Matrigel dome of 50 μL in each well. Maximum size dome recommended for 24-wells is 100 μL.",
    "To plate more than one well, prepare a master suspension by multiplying the volume of cell suspension for one single well by the number of wells intended to plate, plus 1 extra well to account for dead volume lost during pipetting. Transfer the cell suspension into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube containing 9 times volume of Matrigel, pipette up and down to mix well and dispense the cell suspension in each pre-coated well. As an example, to plate 5 wells with a 50 μL dome, each containing 30,000 cells in 5 μL, consider pipetting 30 μL of cell suspension (5 μL × 6 wells) into 270 μL of Matrigel. Plate 50 μL in each pre-coated well.\nKeep tubes containing Matrigel on ice until plating.\nNote: The ratio between the volume of cell aggregates suspension (VC) containing 30,000 cell aggregates, and the volume of Matrigel (VM) should be maintained at 1:9 (VC:VM) in order to allow optimal growth of organoid colonies and to allow Matrigel to set. If cell recovery is low, and the suspension of aggregates is too diluted i.e. less than 30,000 cell aggregates per 5 μL medium, it is recommended to centrifuge the sample, aspirate off the supernatant, and resuspend the sample in smaller volumes.\nNote: Studies have shown that plating cell aggregates (<10 cells), rather than single cell suspension, generates organoid colonies in a shorter time, as cell aggregates more rapidly adapt to the tissue culture environment than single cells do. Cell aggregates also display higher cell viability, possibly owing to the retention of positive cell-to-cell interactions (Miyoshi and Stappenbeck, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Sato et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nTake the pre-coated 24-well plate (step 5) from the incubator and place it in the tissue culture hood.\nPipette and mix the cell aggregates/Matrigel suspension a few times before plating.",
    "Position the pipette vertically over the center of a well and pipette the Matrigel containing cells in the middle of the well. This should form a small Matrigel dome.\nPlate as many wells as necessary repeating the steps above.\nGently transfer the 24-well plate to a 37oC cell incubator for 30 min to allow Matrigel to set.\nOnce set, take the 24-well plate back to the hood and gently overlay 1 mL of pre-warmed Organoid culture medium in each well, then return the plate to the 37oC cell incubator.\nChange culture medium every 2 days. Avoid touching or disturbing the cell dome while pipetting the medium off, and carefully add the 1 mL of pre-warmed fresh medium (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/959-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Plating of mammary organoids\n(A) Bright field microscopy image showing optimal density of mammary organoids plated in a 24 well (30,000 aggregates in 50 μL of Matrigel and Organoid Medium). At Day2 of culture, mammary organoids appear as small, single spheres.\n(B) Image showing densely plated mammary organoids. In over-plated cultures, mammary organoids appear very close to each other and interfere with each other growth rates.\nScale bar = 400 μm.\nCritical: On the day of plating, the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 is included in the medium to prevent anoikis. Loss of cell-to-cell interactions can induce death of primary epithelial cells after detachment from the gland basement membrane, i.e. anoikis (Sato et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]; Watanabe et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]).\nNote: See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]-Problem 3 if 2D cells are visible at the bottom of the wells.",
    "Alternative for tumor-derived cells: The experimental steps described in this protocol can also be used to isolate and establish 3D-cultures of tumor epithelial cells (tumoroids) derived from mammary tumors (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]) (Duarte et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). In our experimental settings, we have successfully generated mammary tumoroids from tumors driven by cancer mutations in the tumor suppressor PTEN and the proto-oncogene PI3K (Yip et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]). For tumor samples:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/959-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

See text for details.\nProcess mice as in Step 2. Dissection of mammary fat pads.\nDissect out mammary tumors, place them in a 100 mm dish and remove normal-looking mammary fat pads.\nProcessing one sample at the time, use a razor blade to cut tumors in small portions and mince as described in Step 3. Isolation of mammary epithelial fragments, until it reaches a consistent texture (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]). Optional: portions of un-minced samples can be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80oC for further analyses (e.g., protein and DNA extraction).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/959-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Images of minced tissues\nMammary fat pads from 2 months old wild-type mouse (top), and mammary tumor (bottom) from 6-month-old mPTEN/mPI3K mouse, were collected, placed on a 100 mm dish, and minced with razor blades. Insufficient tissue mincing results in non-homogeneous tissue appearance, where aggregates of fat tissue and blood vessels are still visible (middle figures). Optimal tissue mincing generates a homogenous suspension of fragments, where histological aggregates can no longer be identified (right).

A well in which > 70% of organoid colonies has reached ∼ 200 μm in size should be considered confluent. At this stage, organoids need to be passaged and re-plated in fresh Matrigel. On average, organoids are passaged every week at 1:4 to 1:6 dilutions. One confluent well of a 24-well plate contains on approximately 200,000 cells, which can generate 60 μg of total protein lysates.\nPassaging of mammary organoids:\nNote: Thaw fresh aliquots of Matrigel on ice in a 4°C cold room for 14–16 hours, or on ice at 20°C–25°C for 1–2 hours.\nAspirate the culture medium without touching the cell dome, using a vacuum aspirator.",
    "Add 1 mL of TrypLE to each confluent well and gently break the Matrigel by pipetting up and down 5–6 times.\nIncubate the 24-well plate at 37°C in a cell incubator for 2 min.\nTake the plate out and place in the tissue culture hood, and mechanically dissociate mammary organoids into smaller cell aggregates by pipetting several times to assist the enzymatic digestion.\nReturn the plate to the incubator for another 3 min of digestion.\nNote: The majority of organoid colonies will be fully digested into aggregates (∼10 cells) using standard incubation time, i.e. 5 min. However, with large organoid colonies (>300 μm in diameter), 1–2 additional min of incubation with TrypLE may be required. Monitor the progression of the digestion under the microscope to identify optimal incubation time. Do not digest organoids to single cells as this may affect cell viability and may extend time of recovery after plating. Use a 1-mL pipette tip to pipette the suspension and facilitate cell dissociation.\nAt the end of the digestion, transfer the cell suspension into a 15 mL tube and add 3 mL of 0.1% FBS in basal DMEM/F12 medium to stop the TrypLE.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 450 × g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant, resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of Organoid culture medium and count the number of cell aggregates.\nTransfer 30,000 cell aggregates in Organoid culture medium to a 1.5 mL tube containing 9 volumes of Matrigel (See step 6. Plating mammary organoids).\nPlate the dome of cell aggregates in the middle of a well in a fresh 24-well plate, pre-coated with Matrigel (See step 5 for the coating steps).",
    "Note: The frequency with which organoids are passaged should be determined empirically based on the growth rates of the newly established organoids. This may vary depending on the genetic background of the cells, as well as on the presence of oncogenic mutations, which may increase growth rates.\nNote: Mammary organoids generated with this protocol maintain relevant molecular and lineage markers (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]) and can be passaged and used for assays until passage 5–6.

SMA-alpha, phalloidin and DAPI stains were generated as 3D whole mount staining and image acquired with a Lecia SP8 confocal microscope.\nScale bar = 50 μm.\nCryopreservation of mammary organoids\nTiming: for freezing/thawing: 10 min per well of a 24-well plate\nNote: From the time of initial plating, mammary organoids derived from crude preparation will require 1-week time to grow and become confluent, before they can be frozen. Confluent wells can also be processed to generate formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) blocks (Duarte et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]), which can be sectioned and used to determine the cellular composition of organoid colonies through immunocytochemistry or immunofluorescence assays (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]).\nFreezing organoid cultures",

If desired, under-confluent wells containing smaller organoid colonies (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A) can be mechanically dissociated using a 1 mL pipette tip, and frozen without trypsinization or dilution.\nNote: It is recommended to freeze organoids as aggregates and not as single cells as this will generate more rapid recovery and higher cell viability.\nRecovery of frozen mammary organoids in culture\nTiming: 10 min per well of a 24-well plate\nThawing of cryopreserved organoids\nNote: Thaw fresh aliquots of Matrigel on ice in a 4°C cold room for 14–16 hours, or on ice at 20°C–25°C for 1–2 hours.

This protocol has also been used to test sensitivity to inhibitors directed at components of the PI3K pathway (Please refer to Yip et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]). Briefly, the day after plating, mammary organoid lines were treated with various PI3K and AKT inhibitors, at different concentrations, for 4 days, and drugs were refreshed every two days. At the end of each treatment, growth rate of mammary organoids were processed with the Promega CellTiter –Glo 3D assay, and according to the manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.promega.com.au/-/media/files/resources/protocols/technical-manuals/101/celltiter-glo-3d-cell-viability-assay-protocol.pdf?rev=88083aa3f7284e898ff0f218aa3c6b59&sc_lang=en].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/959-Fig11.jpg\nFigure 11.

    "Figure 12. Cell growth assay of mammary organoids under drug treatment\nMammary organoid lines were generated from wild-type and mutant mice: PTENCS/+ mouse, K8-PI3KHR/+ mouse, and PTENCS/+; K8-PI3KHR/+ mutant mouse. The PTENC124S mutation is a loss-of-function mutation that inhibits PTEN catalytic function. In K8-PI3KHR/+ mice, the PI3KH1047R mutation is driven by the tamoxifen-induced Cre-recombinase under the cytokeratin 8 promoter, K8-CreERT2, (K8-PI3KHR/+).\n(A) Image of organoids plated in 96-well plate and grown in Organoid medium for 4 days. Scale bar = 1000 μm.\n(B) Mammary organoids with the indicated genetic mutations were plated in 96-wells and treated for 4 days with increasing concentrations of the p110α-specific PI3K inhibitor BYL719. Response to treatment was assessed using the CellTiter-Glo 3D assay, and values normalized over untreated wells, within the same genotype. Data represent mean values with individual data points ± standard deviation shown as triplicate wells.\nPlating of mammary organoids in 96-well plates for growth assay\nNote: Thaw fresh aliquots of Matrigel on ice in a 4°C cold room for 14–16 hours, or on ice at 20°C–25°C for 1–2 hours.\nPre-coat each of the required wells of a 96-well plate with 5 μL of Matrigel and incubate the plate in a 37°C incubator for 5 min.\nCritical: Do not exceed 5 min incubation as this would dry out the coating layer and prevent an even plating of the cell/Matrigel suspension. After 5 min incubation, leave the plate in the cell culture hood, at room temperature.\nCritical: When using 96-well plates, avoid plating cells in the outer wells to circumvent the “edge effect” and evaporation of culturing medium. It is suggested to fill the empty wells with 200 μL of sterilised water to minimize loss of volume in experimental wells.",
    "Take the 24-well plate containing the organoid cultures and proceed to count the number of cell aggregates as in step 7.\nPrepare a cell/Matrigel suspension with a concentration of 8000 cell aggregates per 20 μL total volume.\nUsing a P-20 tip, transfer 20 μL of cell/Matrigel mixture into each well of a 96-well plate.\nGently and slowly pipette the 20 μL of cell/Matrigel suspension right at the center of the well, on top of the Matrigel coating layer. The suspension will spread evenly within a few seconds.\nLeave the 96-well plate at 37oC in a cell incubator to set for 20 min.\nOnce the Matrigel has set, take the 96-well plate back to the hood and overlay 200 μL of Organoid culture medium per well.\nIncubate the 96-well plate at 37oC in a cell incubator for 6 days and refresh Organoid culture medium every 2 days (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]A).\nMeasure growth of organoid colonies (e.g., CellTiter-Glo 3D assay) (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]B).\nOptional: (j-m): Growth assay in response to drug treatments.\nThe day after plating (step 10.g) gently aspirate the 200 μL of Organoid culture medium off the well without disturbing the cell dome.\nPrepare a master mix containing the drug concentration to be tested diluted in Organoid culture medium. Additional wells treated with vehicles should be included as controls.\nPipette the Organoid culture medium off and add 200 μL of master mix in each well of a 96-well plate.\nIncubate the 96-well plate at 37oC in a cell incubator for 4 days\nNote: treatment can be refreshed every 2 days.\nAt the end of the experiment, measure growth of organoid colonies in response to treatment (e.g., CellTiter-Glo 3D assay) (Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]).",
    "Note: The number of mammary organoids plated for drug treatment can vary depending on the growth rates of each experimental organoid line, and also on the length of the treatment. The optimal numbers of organoids to be plated should be tested and determined empirically. Also see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]-Problem 4 for inconsistent results across technical replicates.\nAlternatives: To test response of mammary organoids to drug treatments, reduced Matrigel concentration; 2%–5% Matrigel in growth medium can be used to limit usage of reagents (Wrenn et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]; Zhang et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]).\nCell death assay of mammary organoids using propidium iodide (PI) and hoechst 33342 staining\nTiming: 45 min\nThe following protocol can be utilized to quantify percentage of dead cells in mammary organoids using fluorescent dyes, such as propidium iodide (PI) and Hoechst 33342 staining. The experimental steps have been optimized for 96-well organoid cultures, and the percentage of cell death (PI positive cells) is normalized over the number of live cells (Hoechst 33342 positive cells). Any fluorescence plate readers equipped with appropriate filters (indicated below) can be used to measure PI and Hoechst 33342 signals.\nCell death quantification of mammary organoid cultures\nNote: It is recommended to use clear-bottom black wall microplates for fluorescence reading to minimize signal interference from neighbouring wells.\nNote: For PI staining, plate extra wells of organoids as positive control. Before staining, treat the additional well with 0.1% Triton X-100 diluted in Organoid culture medium for 1 min. Stain the positive control and the experimental samples at once. Triton X-100 is a non-ionic surfactant that permeabilizes the plasma membrane and exposes the DNA, thus facilitating PI labelling.\nFollowing drug treatment, or at the end of a growth assay experiment, replace the Organoid culture medium with 200 μL of staining medium (See materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] for preparation).",
    "Place the organoids in a 37°C cell incubator and let them stain for 30 min.\nRemove staining medium without disturbing the cell dome and add 200 μL of PBS-1×.\nMeasure the fluorescent PI signal using a multi-mode microplate reader (e.g., CLARIOstar PLUS microplate reader).\nAdjust focal height.\nMeasure fluorescence signals using the following parameters: excitation and emission wavelengths for PI: 535 nm and 617 nm; and excitation and emission wavelengths for Hoechst 33342: 361 nm and 486 nm.\nMeasure PI first and Hoechst 33342 next (Figure 13[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig13]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/959-Fig13.jpg\nFigure 13. Cell death assay of mammary organoids\nWild-type mammary organoids were cultured in Organoid culture medium and supplemented with increasing concentrations of noggin conditioned medium for 6 days. Effect on cell death was assayed as described in step 11, using propidium iodide (PI) and Hoechst33342 stain. Wells treated with 0.1% Triton-X 100 in Organoid culture medium were used as positive control. Data revealed no significant difference in the ratio of dead versus live cells upon noggin administration, indicating no beneficial effect on organoids survival upon noggin addition. a.u. = arbitrary unit. Data represent mean ± standard deviation of triplicate wells.\nNote: PI and Hoechst 33342 are both DNA dyes. Live cells with intact cell membranes are impermeable to PI but permeable to Hoechst 33342. Therefore, the relative intensity of the dyes can be used as a way to discriminate between dead cells and live cells (See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]-Problem 5).\nNote: Using this cell death protocol, mammary organoids can be sequentially processed with the CellTiter-Glo 3D assay to also measure growth rates, if desired."
