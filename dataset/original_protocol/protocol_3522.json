Representative images of Six2-DTA mouse embryos\n(A) Schematic of the Six2-CreERT2-diphtheria toxin fragment A (DTA) system. Nephron progenitor cells (NPCs) consist cap mesenchyme surrounding ureteric buds (UBs). With tamoxifen, CreERT2 in Six2-expressing NPCs accesses the nuclear compartment, removing the loxP-flanked stop sequence. Accordingly, DTA is expressed, and NPCs are ablated while UBs remain unperturbed. Figure reprinted with permission from Fujimoto et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2].\n(B) A vaginal plug of a female Rosa26-DTA176 mouse 0.5 days post-coitum (red arrow) and a control.\n(C) A metanephros (MN) of a Six2-DTA mouse embryo on embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5). Six2-green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression by NPCs is observed in the MN. Scale bar, 500 μm.\nMate female/male B6;129-Six2[tm3(EGFP/cre/ERT2) Amc]/J (Six2-GCE) mice (Kobayashi et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) with male/female B6;129-Gt(ROSA)26Sor[tm1(DTA) Mrc]/J (Rosa26-DTA176) mice (Wu et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) to obtain offspring Six2-DTA mice. For breeding, use timed mating: consider 12 pm of the day that the vaginal plug was detected as 0.5 days post-coitum (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nSix2-GCE mice are heterozygous, while Rosa26-DTA176 mice are homozygous. Therefore, 50% of the embryos are Six2-DTA, which can be identified based on the expression of Six2-green fluorescent protein (GFP) by NPCs in MNs under a fluorescent stereomicroscope (M205FA, Leica Microsystems) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nNote: MNs contain RPCs, which include NPCs, stromal progenitor cells (SPCs), and ureteric buds (UBs). In contrast, the NPCs derived from hiPSCs according to our protocol do not include SPCs or UBs.\nNote:",
    "The Six2-GCE allele expresses an eGFPCreERT2 (EGFP and creERT2) fusion protein from the Six2 promoter/enhancer elements. CreERT2 is restricted to the cytoplasm, and it can only gain access to the nuclear compartment after exposure to tamoxifen. While homozygous Six2-GCE mice die shortly after birth due to the loss of Six2 gene function, heterozygous mice are viable and fertile with no reported abnormalities.\nThe ROSA26-DTA176 mice carry a loxP-flanked stop cassette followed by the coding sequence of an attenuated diphtheria toxin A chain (DTA176) in the Rosa26 locus. The DTA176 coding sequence is only expressed after the loxP-flanked stop sequence is removed via Cre-mediated recombination, leading to cell apoptosis. Homozygous ROSA26-DTA176 mice are viable and fertile, with no reported abnormalities.\nIn the resulting Six2-DTA mice, tamoxifen activates CreERT2 and induces specific DTA expression in Six2-expressing NPCs, leading to apoptosis of NPCs.\nNote: Use both Six2-GCE mice and Rosa26-DTA176 mice at 10–25 weeks of age for mating. It does not matter which of the pair is male or female. House all mice in a temperature- and humidity-controlled environment with a 12-h light-dark cycle, and provide all mice with standard laboratory chow and water.\nOptional: To ascertain that NPCs of Six2-DTA mice are eliminated using tamoxifen, culture the MNs of those mice on embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT). For the organ culture protocol, please refer to steps 16–19. Subsequent immunostaining reveals atrophy of the MNs and almost complete elimination of Six2-expressing NPCs. Furthermore, 4OHT at this concentration does not damage the MNs of nontransgenic mice (Fujimoto et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nEnzymatic dissociation of the metanephroses isolated from GFP-labeled mice and rats\nTiming: 2 h",
    "Prepare the dissociated RPCs from the MNs of GFP-labeled mice or rats for subsequent injections into the nephrogenic zone (see Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]). The preferred age of pregnant animals is 13.5–14.5 days for mice and 15.5–16.5 days for rats.\nExtract embryos from GFP-mice.\nEuthanize the GFP-mouse at 13.5–14.5 days of pregnancy by dislocation of the cervical vertebrae.\nRemove the uteruses through a median incision and place them in a 10-cm dish containing Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) with calcium and magnesium but without phenol red.\nExtract the embryos from the isolated uteruses and euthanize them by decapitation (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/444-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Scale bar, 1 mm.\nCollect pairs of MNs from embryos using micro-tweezers under a stereoscopic microscope.\nRemove the tail (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nDissect both sides along the vertebral column from the caudal end to the neck. Both sides of the rib cage should be cut so that the vertebral column can be easily separated (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C and 3D).\nRemove the vertebral column from the body and lay the embryo in a prone position (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E and 3F).\nDissect the MNs and collect them into a 1.5-mL tube containing 1 mL of minimum essential medium α (MEM α).\nEnzymatically dissociate MNs using a modified version of the protocol described by Davies et al. (2012)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/444-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Enzymatic dissociation of metanephroses (MNs)\n(A) Schematic of the procedure.\n(B) MNs in Accutase before (left) and after (right) manual pipetting with a 200-μL pipette tip.",
    "(C) Cell suspension passing through a 40-μm cell strainer.\nCentrifuge MNs at 700 × g for 3 min.\nRemove the supernatants and add 1 mL of Accutase (15°C–25°C) into the tube. Vortex to aid digestion.\nIncubate MNs at 37°C for 15 min, vortex after 5 min, and manually pipette using a 200-μL pipette tip after 10 and 15 min (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nCentrifuge MNs at 300 × g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatants and resuspend the pellet with 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Dissociate MNs by manual pipetting with a 200-μL pipette tip.\nFilter the cell suspension using a 40-μm cell strainer to obtain a single-cell suspension (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C). Centrifuge the suspension at 700 × g for 3 min.\nCompletely remove the supernatants. Tap and mix the pellet.\nPause Point: The pellet can be incubated on ice until its use within the same day, though incubation for more than 4 h leads to a decline in cell viability.\nCritical: Manual pipetting of MNs should be carefully performed. Too much pipetting is harmful to the cells, while too little is not enough to dissociate the cells.\nNote: When extracting embryos from GFP-rats, anesthetize the pregnant rats by isoflurane inhalation, unlike GFP-mice. After removing the uteruses, euthanize the mother immediately by pentobarbital (120 mg/kg) infusion. Subsequent steps to isolate MNs from GFP-rat embryos are the same as those from GFP-mouse embryos.\nNote: According to a study that used flow cytometry (Yamanaka et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]), NPCs account for approximately 30% of dissociated single cells extracted from the MNs of E13.5 mouse embryos. The remaining cells include SPCs and UBs.\nNote: There is no need to detect the sex of embryos because MNs from both sexes can be used.",
    "Optional: In step 5f, before centrifugation, stain the sample with Trypan Blue and observe under a light microscope to determine the cell number and viability and ensure that a single-cell suspension is obtained.\nMaintenance of hiPSCs\nTiming: 6 days\nHuman NPCs for subsequent injections into the nephrogenic zone are induced from hiPSCs, which are maintained according to the following step.\nMaintain 201B7 cells, a hiPSC line, on iMatrix-511 in StemFit AK02N. Culture the cells in 6-well plates in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C, and passage them every 6 days. After the cells attain 70%–80% confluence, treat them with Accutase. Seed the cells into another well with a diameter of 35 mm at a concentration of 1.5 × 104 cells per well.\nInduction and dissociation of NPCs from hiPSCs\nTiming: 12 days\nInduce NPCs from iPSCs as follows, according to the previously established method (Taguchi et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Taguchi and Nishinakamura, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nReaggregate hiPSCs at 10 000 cells/aggregate in V-bottom 96-well low cell-binding plates in the presence of base media for human NPCs supplemented with 10 μM Y27632, 1 ng/mL human Activin A, and 20 ng/mL human basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-basic) (100 μL/well).\nAfter 24 h, i.e., on day 1, transfer the spheres to U-bottom 96-well low-cell-binding plates containing base media for human NPCs supplemented with 10 μM CHIR and 10 μM Y27632 (200 μL/well). Subsequently, replace half of the culture media with new media every other day, i.e., on days 3 and 5.\nOn day 7, transfer the spheres to new U-bottom plates containing the base media for human NPCs supplemented with 10 ng/mL human Activin A, 3 ng/mL human bone morphogenetic protein 4 (Bmp4), 3 μM CHIR, 0.1 μM retinoic acid, and 10 μM Y27632 (200 μL/well).",
    "On day 9, transfer the spheres to new U-bottom plates containing the base media for human NPCs supplemented with 1 μM CHIR, 5 ng/mL fibroblast growth factor-9 (FGF-9), and 10 μM Y27632 (200 μL/well).\nOn day 12, create the NPC spheres (NPSs).\nIncubate NPCs in 5 mL of Enzyme Solution (a component of the Neuron Dissociation Solutions kit) at 37°C for 30 min.\nPellet the NPCs by centrifugation at 190 × g for 4 min.\nResuspend the pellets in 5 mL of Dispersion solution (a component of the Neuron Dissociation Solutions kit). Add 5 mL of Isolation solution (a component of Neuron Dissociation Solutions kit).\nPellet the NPCs by centrifugation at 160 × g for 5 min.\nResuspend the pellets in 1 mL of PBS and filter them through a 40-μm cell strainer.\nPellet again them by centrifugation at 160 × g for 5 min.\nCompletely remove the supernatant. Tap the tube to mix the pellet and incubate on ice until its use within the same day.\nNote: Neuron Dissociation Solutions kit is a product by Wako that comprises an Enzyme Solution, a Dispersion solution, and an Isolation solution.\nFlow cytometry\nTiming: 1 h\nPerform flow cytometry to confirm the purity of NPCs in NPSs before the injections into the nephrogenic zone. NPCs are characterized by the presence of integrin α8 (ITGA8) and the absence of platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα) (Kaku et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nUse about 5 × 105 cells from the single-cell solution obtained in step 11e. Treat the solution with biotinylated anti-ITGA8, allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated streptavidin, and phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-PDGFRα for cell staining. Acquire and analyze the data using the MACSQuantify analysis software.",
    "Note: In flow cytometry, to evaluate the purity of the induced NPSs, only a part of the suspension is used. The procedure itself does not affect the following steps, given that the fraction of suspension used is discarded.\nThe injection of exogenous RPCs into the nephrogenic zone\nTiming: 1–2 h\nUsing a sharp glass needle, inject RPCs (dissociated from MNs of GFP-mice and GFP-rats) and human NPCs (induced from hiPSCs) into the nephrogenic zone under the MN capsule of Six2-DTA mice. The MNs that underwent injections are subsequently cultured in vitro and in vivo. Please also refer to Yamanaka et al. (2017)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] regarding these steps.\nUse E13.5–14.5 Six2-DTA mouse embryos. Extract the embryos as described in step 3.\nExpose the MN pairs in embryos with micro-tweezers, as described in step 4.\nInject exogenous RPCs into the nephrogenic zone. Use RPCs from GFP-mice or GFP-rats, or NPCs from hiPSCs in each experiment.\nFix the embryo with micro-tweezers.\nFill the glass needle with the dissociated exogenous RPCs.\nInsert the glass needle through the renal hilus to the nephrogenic zone under the capsule. Inject cells slowly by mouth pipetting under a stereoscopic microscope (M205FA, Leica Microsystems), with a 1-mL syringe and an aspirator tube assembly connected to the glass needle (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/444-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. The injection of exogenous renal progenitor cells (RPCs) into the nephrogenic zone\n(A) The embryo in a prone position is held with micro-tweezers. A glass needle is inserted under the renal capsule. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-RPCs are injected.\n(B) Metanephroses (MNs) after three injections of GFP-RPCs into each MN. Scale bar, 1 mm.\nAfter injecting the indicated number of cells (4–8 × 104 cells in 0.2–0.4 μL) into the nephrogenic zone, pull out the needle carefully not to rupture the capsule (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). (See Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting])",
    "Critical: Exogenous RPCs should be injected into the subcapsular area and not the renal parenchyma to ensure that the injected cells spread widely to interact with the host cap mesenchyme as much as possible. Several injections (up to 2–4) are needed to cover this area.\nCritical: Carefully put forward the glass needle immediately before the capsule to spread the RPCs in the nephrogenic zone.\nCritical: The supernatants of centrifuged pellets should be removed entirely because moist pellets tend to tear the capsule by being released from the needle in large droplets.\nCritical: It is challenging to perform RPCs injections in MNs from Six2-DTA mouse embryos older than 15.5 days, since their capsule becomes tightly attached to the nephrogenic zone.\nNote: The outer diameter of the sharpened glass needle tip is approximately 0.1 mm, while that of the original needle is 1.0 mm. The length of the sharp tip is approximately 1.0 mm. Cell pellets will be contained in the tip whose volume is approximately 0.1 μL (2 × 104 cells).\nNote: The injections require about 15 min for both MNs of one embryo. The total time depends on the number of target embryos.\nOptional: In step 15c, a pen-type syringe pump (a motorized injector drive) can be used instead of mouth pipetting (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nOrgan culture of isolated metanephroses\nTiming: 7 days\nIn vitro regeneration of nephrons derived from exogenous RPCs in the nephrogenic zone of Six2-DTA mouse MNs: Culture Six2-DTA mouse MNs which were injected with exogenous RPCs on Transwell plates with tamoxifen.\nDetach the MNs from the embryos of Six2-DTA mice containing exogenous RPCs.\nPlace the isolated MNs on the air-fluid interface of polycarbonate filters with an average pore size of 0.4 μm (12-mm Transwell plates).",
    "Soak the plates with base media for MNs (400 μL/well) supplemented with 4OHT (1 μg/well; 2.5 μg/mL).\nCulture MNs for 7 days at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Change the media and add 4OHT (1 μg/well; 2.5 μg/mL) daily.\nTransplantation of metanephroses with the ureters and bladder into adult mice or rats\nTiming: 2–4 weeks\nIn vivo regeneration of nephrons derived from exogenous RPCs in the nephrogenic zone of Six2-DTA mouse MNs: Transplant MNs with the ureters and bladder (MNBs) into the retroperitoneum of adult NOD/Shi-scid, IL-2RγKO Jic (NOG) mice or LEW/SsNSlc (Lewis) rats with tamoxifen. Lewis rats need to be treated with immunosuppressants to prevent acute rejection. Thereafter, the neo-nephrons will produce urine, which will be excreted to the embryonic bladder. The MNs can grow without hydronephrosis for a certain period of time.\nAfter injections of exogenous RPCs into the bilateral MNs as explained in steps 13–15, detach the MNBs from the embryos of Six2-DTA mice.\nCarefully remove the bilateral mesonephroses and the intestine connected to the MNs.\nDissect both groins vertically to reveal the bladder (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/444-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Transplantation of metanephroses with ureters and bladder (MNBs) containing exogenous renal progenitor cells (RPCs) to host animals\n(A–C) Detachment of MNBs.\n(A) Both groins are dissected vertically.\n(B) Micro-tweezers are inserted under the metanephroses (MNs) to peel off the connective tissue.\n(C) The MNs are lifted, and the bladder remains connected to the body (arrow).\n(D) The MNB is detached and trimmed. Injected Green fluorescent protein-tagged renal progenitor cells (GFP-RPCs) are confirmed.\n(E) The MNB is transplanted into the pocket of the retroperitoneum in the vicinity of the descending aorta in a NOD/Shi-scid, IL-2RγKO Jic (NOG) mouse. Scale bar, 1 mm.",
    "Insert micro-tweezers under the MNs to peel the connective tissue and cut the cranial side of the MNs (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nLift the MNs and remove the remaining intestine and the spleen (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C).\nDetach the MNBs by cutting the root of the bladder and trim the MNBs (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D).\nPause Point: The MNBs can be incubated in HBSS on ice for less than 4 h, until their use in the next step.\nAnesthetize host animals by isoflurane inhalation and reveal the descending aorta via a median incision. Cut the retroperitoneum in the vicinity of the descending aorta approximately 1–2 mm horizontally, and make a pocket using micro-tweezers, under a surgical microscope (S9D, Leica Microsystems). Transplant isolated MNBs into the pocket (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]E).\nDissolve tamoxifen in corn oil at a concentration of 40 mg/mL. Treat host animals with tamoxifen by daily oral gavage for six days, starting the day before transplantation (NOG mice: 200 mg/kg/day; Lewis rats: 60 mg/kg/day).\nTo prevent acute rejection in Lewis rats, administer 2 mg/kg tacrolimus subcutaneously and 5 mg/kg methylprednisolone intraperitoneally daily starting the day before transplantation.\nTo evaluate urine production, administer intravenous tetramethylrhodamine-labeled dextran (10 000 MW, 200 μL of 5 mg/mL) daily to a few NOG mice, starting 5 days prior to the collection of MNBs.\nTwo or four weeks later, euthanize host animals by intraperitoneal pentobarbital infusion and remove transplanted MNBs for histological analysis.\nCritical: If the capsule is peeled off during the detachment of MNBs, the injected RPCs can be lost. In addition, care should be taken not to cut the ureters to avoid hydronephrosis. Some connective tissue remnants around the MNBs are permitted.\nNote: Differentiation into mature nephrons can be confirmed after 2 weeks, but urine production cannot be ascertained until 4 weeks after the injections of exogenous RPCs.\nWhole-mount immunostaining",

    "Note: The primary antibodies listed in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] correspond to specific structures: Six2 for NPCs; CK8 for UBs; WT1 and Nephrin for glomeruli; CDH6, AQP1, and Megalin for proximal tubules; ECAD for distal tubules; and CD31 for vascular endothelial cells. Pax8 staining is positive in distal nephrons connecting with the ureteric tip. Anti-GFP antibodies enable the detection of structures derived from exogenous RPCs from GFP-mice or rats. Anti-human nuclei antibodies are used to detect human cells because hiPSCs used in this protocol are not labeled with fluorescent proteins. Anti-vimentin antibodies are used for the species-specific detection of rat cells. Do not mix primary antibodies from the same species in a given sample.
