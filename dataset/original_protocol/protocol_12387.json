    "This protocol conforms to the AVMA Animal Welfare Principles for the care and use of laboratory animals and has been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Midwestern University.\n1. Preparation of Anesthesia, Equipment, & Media\nDechlorinate approximately 1.5 L of tap water using either a commercial dechlorinating agent (available at pet stores) or by letting water stand for 24 hr. Obtain three 1 L beakers and fill each with 500 ml dechlorinated water. Label one for holding fish before any procedure and one for recovery. To the third beaker, add 100 µg/ml of tricaine methanesulfonate; this becomes the beaker in which fish will be anesthetized.\nFill a shallow tray with ice, warm the culture medium (RPMI 1640, 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum), 50 µg/ml gentamycin, 100 µg/ml kanamycin, 25 mM HEPES) to RT, and gather clean jeweler’s tweezers. Clean tweezers by immersing the tips in 70% ethanol and pass through a Bunsen burner, allowing the ethanol to burn off.\nDecide if the procedure will be performed without magnification, with a commercial, table-top lighted magnifying glass with 2 - 10X magnification, or dissecting microscope (entirely dependent on personal preference).\n2. Establish Explant Cultures\nCatch the desired number of fish and place in a holding beaker. Transfer a single fish to the anesthesia beaker; it is best to anesthetize fish individually.\nMonitor the effects of anesthesia by observing the swimming and gill movement of the fish. As anesthesia progresses, gill movement slows and the fish will swim erratically and frequently upside down; consider fish anesthetized as soon as gill movement ceases. Do not leave the fish for longer periods in the anesthesia bath as this may result in the death of the fish.",
    "Remove fish from the anesthesia beaker and transfer to ice, placing the fish horizontally with the tail facing the hand holding the tweezers. If experienced with the technique and if multiple fish are to be used to make explants, consider placing the next fish in the anesthesia beaker at this time.\nTo remove scales, position tweezers parallel to the fish with tip at edge of scale. Depress flat side of the tweezers slightly into the side of the fish to cause the scale to elevate from the body of the fish. Grasp scale with tweezers, pluck, and place (without inversion) in tissue culture dish. Repeat the procedure, removing a maximum of 12 scales from a large adult (6 from each side), avoiding the gill region, the lateral line, and fins.\nPlace the fish into the recovery beaker and monitor to ensure it recovers from the effects of anesthesia. At this time, fish can be transferred back to an individual tank. Allow the fish to recover for at least 21 days to allow for complete scale regeneration.\nDepending on the experimental design, place up to 20 scales per plastic 35 mm tissue culture-treated dish or 4 - 6 scales per glass bottom dish. Allow scales to adhere to the dish before gently adding media so as not to detach scales from the dish.\n\tNOTE: With experience, multiple fish can be processed before media is added to the first dish.\nAdd 1.2 ml of complete media (see 1.2 above) into each 35 mm dish.\nPreferably incubate explant cultures at 28 °C in 5% CO2 for the desired period of time with or without additional treatment. Alternatively, incubate cultures on a heated microscope stage or within a live cell culture chamber for video microscopy.\n3. Brightfield and Video Microscopy",
    "Position dishes containing cell sheets onto the microscope stage and initially focus using the 4X objective lens.\n\tNOTE: Higher magnifications may be used, depending on the experiment. Marking the location of each cell sheet and/or orientation of the dish on the stage will facilitate taking images over time with the sheets in approximately the same orientation.\nRemove dishes from the incubator and photograph at various time points, according to each experimental protocol and place back into the incubator if only still images are needed over the experimental time frame.\nWhile performing video microscopy, pay attention to the following:\n\t\nPosition the scale/emerging cell sheet within the field of view such that the migrating cell sheet remains in the field of view for the duration of the video.\n\t\tNOTE: This may take some experience in observing how cells migrate from under the scale. For short videos, this is less of a concern than for longer videos.\nFor shorter time frames, incubate at RT. For longer time frames (18+ hr), use a heated stage or an incubation chamber to maintain temperature, pH balance, and to minimize evaporation of the culture medium.\n4. Fixation for Immunofluorescence Microscopy\nPrepare and pre-warm all solutions to 28 °C. In order to view keratocytes under fluorescence, grow explant cultures as described above using glass-bottom 35 mm tissue culture dishes. Alternatively, use glass chamber slides.\nAdd 0.8 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in 1.1x PBS to each dish. Do not remove the culture media first. Incubate at RT for 5 min then aspirate to remove the solution.\nAdd 0.8 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in 1.1x PBS to each dish. Incubate at RT for 5 min then aspirate to remove the solution.",
    "Unless using external ligands or external epitopes, permeabilize cells by adding 0.5 ml of 0.2% Triton X-100 in 1X PBS. Incubate at RT for 5 min then aspirate to remove the solution.\nAdd 0.5 ml of 1% BSA in 1x PBS and incubate for 1 hr (at RT) or O/N (at 4 °C).\n\tNOTE: Depending on experimental conditions, phalloidin can be added at this step.\nAfter incubation, aspirate to remove the solution and proceed with antibody staining. Alternatively, store the culture dishes by adding at least 1 - 2 ml of 1% BSA in 1x PBS for 3 - 4 weeks at 4 °C.\n5. Immunofluorescence Protocol\nPrepare primary and secondary antibody solutions according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.\n\tNOTE: If manufacturer recommendations are not available, a good starting dilution of primary antibodies (in 1% BSA in 1x PBS) is 1:500 for polyclonal and 1:1,000 for monoclonal antibodies; a good starting dilution for secondary antibodies is 1:1,000. Adjust these dilutions of the original stock obtained from the manufacturer higher if the signal is weak, lower if the signal is strong and background is a problem.\nAspirate the 1% BSA in 1x PBS solution. Add 0.5 ml of primary antibody solution and incubate for 1 hr (at RT) or O/N (at 4 °C).\nRemove the primary antibody solution, place into a clean and labeled 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, and freeze at -20 °C.\n\tNOTE: This allows for the reuse of the primary antibody, if needed.\nWash the dish 3 - 5 times with 1x PBS, removing and discarding the PBS after each wash.\nAdd 0.5 ml of secondary antibody solution. If desired, add fluorescently-labeled phalloidin (following any manufacturer’s recommended concentration) during this step. Incubate for 1 hr (at RT) or O/N (at 4 °C).",
    "NOTE: Use of fluorescently-labeled phalloidin allows for visualization of actin filaments; we have found that 488-labeled phalloidin works best in our zebrafish keratocytes, but other fluorophores can be used.\nRemove and discard the secondary antibody solution.\nWash the dish 3 - 5 times with 1x PBS, removing and discarding the PBS after each wash.\n\tNOTE: The dish can be stored, covered from light, at 4 °C if unable to view immediately; make sure 1x PBS is added into the dish before storing to ensure the cells do not dry out but warm to RT (20 - 30 min), then remove the PBS just prior to proceeding to the next step.\nWhen ready to observe, add 2 - 3 drops of a mounting medium, with or without DAPI, depending on the experimental needs, into the dish and let sit for 10 min at RT.\n\tNOTE: We use a commercially-available, glycerol-based mounting medium with DAPI, but other mounting media can be used. Allowing 10 min for the mounting medium to sit in the dish facilitates easy removal of the glass coverslip from the bottom of the dish.\nAfter incubation, gently squeeze on the sides of the dish to loosen and remove the coverslip. Add an additional drop of mounting media onto a glass slide and place the coverslip, cells down, onto the slide.\n\tNOTE: Consider sealing the coverslip to the slide using clear fingernail polish if the slide needs to be kept for longer than 1 - 2 days.\nObserve the slide under a fluorescence microscope.\n\tNOTE: Most of our images were taken using a 40X or 63X objective lens under oil immersion, but the specific objective lens used will depend on the experimental protocol.\nSubscription Required.
