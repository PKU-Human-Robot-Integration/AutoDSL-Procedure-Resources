    "Note: This protocol describes the simultaneous processing of samples using a MiSeq NGS System but can be adapted for the Personal Genome Machine (PGM) instrument. For the recommended minimum DNA input of 400 amplifiable template copies, the assay is capable of producing at least 3,000x median coverage for each of 96 samples per NGS run, and equivalent coverage depth for 24 samples using the PGM on a 318 chip. The method also requires the use of a real-time PCR instrument.\n1. DNA Functional Quantification and Quality Control (QC)\nThaw reagents: 2x Master Mix, Primer Probe Mix, Inhibition Primer Probe Mix, 6-carboxy-X-rhodamine (ROX), Diluent, and the four human genomic DNA calibration curve standards (DNA Standard (50 ng/µl), DNA Standard (10 ng/µl), DNA Standard (2 ng/µl), and DNA Standard (0.4 ng/µl)) (Table 1). Vortex all reagents for 10 sec and centrifuge at maximum speed for 10 sec to collect contents. Keep the 2x master mix on ice.\nPrepare a sufficient amount of master mix for the total number of samples to be tested and include 10% more volume to avoid shortages due to pipetting. Prepare the master mix in a microcentrifuge tube using the following volumes per sample: 5 µl 2x Master Mix, 0.5 µl Primer Probe Mix, 0.5 µl Inhibition Primer Probe Mix, 0.05 µl ROX and 2.95 µl Diluent. Vortex for 10 sec and centrifuge at maximum speed for 10 sec to collect contents.\nAdd 9 µl master mix into wells of a 96-well plate.\nAdd 1 µl of the DNA Standards in duplicate to generate a calibration curve. Mix by pipetting up-and-down 5 times.\nEnsure the nucleic acid sample is well mixed before use. Add 1 µl sample to the master mix and mix by pipetting up-and-down 5 times.",
    "Seal the plate, vortex for 10 sec and centrifuge at maximum speed for 10 sec to collect contents.\nPlace the plate into the PCR System. Assign both FAM (functional quantification) and VIC (functional inhibition) detectors for each sample according to the manufacturer's instructions. Perform PCR cycles of 10 min at 95 °C, and 40 cycles (15 sec at 95 °C, 1 min at 60 °C).\nAnalyze the qPCR data by generating a linear regression plot for each of the duplicate DNA standards using software protocols.\nPlot the Log10 of the copy number for each DNA standard on the x-axis and the corresponding FAM Cq value on the y-axis.\nConfirm that the results from the nucleic acid sample fall within the dynamic range of the DNA Standards calibration curve, and then calculate the concentration of the unknown DNA in \"functional\" or amplifiable copy number per µl from its corresponding position on the reference standard curve. Figure 1 shows examples of calibration curves that passed and failed.\nDetermine if amplification occurred in each reaction by checking for the presence of the non-human target amplicon in the VIC channel.\n\tNote: As a positive control, the Inhibition Primer Probe Mix contains primers specific for a non-human exogenous target and the corresponding template. The Inhibition Primer Probe Mix is a component of the master mix which is added to each reaction, including the no-template control (NTC). In absence of an inhibitor, the PCR product for the non-human target should always be detected in the VIC channel. An \"undetected\" Cq for a sample in the VIC channel indicates the presence of PCR inhibitors that may benefit from subsequent clean-up of the sample prior to further processing.\n2.

Library Purification and Size Selection\nRemove the Library Pure Prep magnetic beads (Table 1) and Elution Buffer (Table 1) from 2-8 °C and allow to equilibrate to RT for 30 min. Add 9.6 ml 100% ethanol to the Wash Buffer (Table 1) container, cap and mix by inverting the bottle several times.\nVortex the magnetic beads for 10 sec and add 11 µl into separate wells of a 96-well plate.\nOpen the Tag PCR plate and add 10 µl of Tag PCR product to the beads and pipet mix 5 times. Incubate the mixture for 4 min at RT.\nPlace the 96-well plate on the magnetic stand (Table 1) for 4 min.

To restart, thaw frozen samples on ice before proceeding.\n5. Library Quantification\nThaw Library Quant (LQ) reagents: 2x LQ Master Mix, LQ Primer / Probe Mix, LQ Standard, LQ Positive Control, LQ Diluent, and LQ ROX (Table 1). Vortex for 10 sec and centrifuge at maximum speed for 10 sec to collect contents.\nUsing purified library products, perform a serial dilution of each individual sample in LQ Diluent.\n\t\nAdd 2 µl (library purified product) to 198 µl LQ Diluent and mix up-and-down with a pipet 10 times.\nAdd 2 µl (1:100 dilution) to 198 µl LQ Diluent and mix up-and-down with a pipet 10 times.",

Calculate the difference of the known LQ Standard (Cq VIC) to the unknown library (Cq FAM). The concentration of the Diluted Sample (pM) is calculated using the following equation:\n\t   [Conclib]nM = 12.5 x 2ΔCq\n\tIf using a dilution factor other than 10,000, calculate the ratio of the target dilution factor to 10,000, and multiply this factor by the result of the equation in 5.7.\n6. Library Normalization and Sample Pooling\nDetermine the median concentration (nM) across all samples (each containing a unique pairwise index) to be pooled.",
    "Determine the individual sample volume (µl) to pool by multiplying the median concentration across all samples by 5, then dividing by its individual concentration (nM). Round the resulting value to the nearest integer. Round volumes with values of <2 µl to 2 µl, and volumes >15 µl to 15 µl.\nAdd the normalized volume (µl) for each sample to a single microcentrifuge tube to create the sample pool.\nCalculate the new concentration for each sample using rounded integer values and record the results.\nTo determine the concentration of the sample pool, calculate the sum of all individual concentrations and record the resulting value (nM).\nDilute the sample pool to 1.25 nM using Sequencing Diluent (Table 1).\n\tNote: The procedure may be safely stopped at this step and samples stored at -15 to -30 °C.

Perform a paired-end 2 x 150 cycle sequencing run.\n8. Data Analysis\nNote: The NGS instrument software converts cluster images to base calls and quality scores, and demultiplexes pairwise indices to generate individual gzip-compressed FASTQ (*.fastq.gz) files for each sample. Prior to analyzing the demultiplexed files, the reader must download and install the associated bioinformatics software (Table 1).

Select the targeted NGS panel type and NGS instrument type. Click \"Save and continue\".\nUpload the compressed FASTQ files for the forward and reverse reads. Do not upload the \"unassigned\" FASTQs, which contain reads that failed to demultiplex. Click \"Save and continue\".\nInput the number of functional input copies used to prepare each library as determined by the DNA functional quantification assay (see Step 1 above). Manually add values or copy and paste values from a spreadsheet into the annotation table. Click \"Save and continue.\"\nReview the annotated libraries uploaded for analysis and click \"Submit analysis\" to initiate the analysis.",
    "Monitor the progress of the analysis displayed through the project dashboard.\n\tNote: An analysis complete status indication is presented when the results are ready for review.\nReview the analyzed results for sample QC metrics including total coverage per library, percentage of reads passing filters, amplicon coverage depth and uniformity. Review the variant calls for each sequenced library with dbSNP, COSMIC, 1,000 genomes and other sources of functional and population level annotation.\nExport the raw results as summary spreadsheet tables, *.bam files and *.vcf files for long-term storage or downstream analysis with complementary informatics tools."
