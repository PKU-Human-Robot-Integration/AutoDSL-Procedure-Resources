    "Animal use protocols were approved by the Health Science Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Alberta (AUP00003000). See Figure 1 for a diagram demonstrating the RYGB anatomy.\n1. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass\nPreparation of animals and operative setup\n\t\nOne week prior to the surgery, provide the rats with oral rehydration therapy and liquid diet in addition to their solid diet and water to acclimatize them to this new diet.\nFast rats with only access to water for 12-18 h prior to the surgery.\n\t\t\nEnsure rats are fasted on a raised wire platform so that they cannot consume bedding material.\nInject rats with subcutaneous long buprenorphine sustained release (SR) at a dose of 1 mg/kg immediately before surgery.\nAutoclave all surgical instruments, towels, and drapes.\nClean the operating surface, heating pad, and anesthetic nose cone with 70% ethanol.\nSet up the operating surface with an operating microscope, anesthetic machine, and supplies in a manner that is ergonomic for the operating surgeon.\nUse a temperature-regulated heating pad and set to 37 °C.\nPlace a sterile drape or towel over the heating pad.\nFill a 50 mL sterile conical tube with 0.9% saline.\nAnesthetic induction and preparation\n\t\nInduce anesthesia using 4% isoflurane as per previously established protocols15.\nApply pressure to the hindfoot of all four limbs to ensure there is no pain response.\nCheck for adequate anesthesia and respiratory rate after every 5 min.\nApply lubricant to both eyes to prevent drying.\nShave hair from the abdomen.\nClean the abdomen with a povidone-iodine solution. Allow the solution to dry, and change into sterile gloves.\nDrape the rat with an opening in the drape to expose the abdomen.\nPlace instruments, sutures, cotton swabs, and a 10 mL syringe in a location that permits easy access during the procedure.\nMedian laparotomy",
    "Make a 3 cm incision in the upper midline of the abdomen using a scalpel, just below the xyphoid process as a landmark.\nUsing scissors, divide the fascia and peritoneum, with care to stay midline on the linea alba to reduce bleeding from the rectus abdominus. If there is bleeding, control it with thermal or electrocautery.\nMobilizing the stomach\n\t\nUsing two wet cotton swabs, bluntly dissect gastric attachments.\nWhen encountering dense adhesions, use thermal cautery to divide gastric attachments with care to avoid cauterizing the stomach. Sharply divide the ligament between the stomach and the accessory liver lobe to reduce the risk of liver tearing with stomach mobilization.\nFor larger blood vessels, especially at the short gastric arteries, ligate using 6-0 polypropylene suture.\nCreate a window on the right distal side of the esophagus but proximal to the left gastric artery. Ensure that a cotton swab can reach into this area posteriorly. The stomach is adequately mobilized when it can be exteriorized outside of the abdomen.\nIdentify and divide the jejunum\n\t\nIdentify the ligament of Treitz by following the jejunum proximally until observing it is attachment to the transverse mesocolon.\nMeasure 7 cm distally, identify a location between mesenteric vessels, and divide the bowel with micro scissors. Avoid Peyer's patches when dividing the bowel. Take care to only divide the bowel and not the mesentery.\nPlace a clean, saline soaked sponge prior to dividing the bowel to minimize contamination.\nCheck for the presence of a small crossing vessel in the mesentery at the border of the small bowel and divide this with cautery to avoid bleeding.\nContinue to divide the mesentery 1 cm towards the mesenteric base.",
    "Identify the proximal and distal jejunum. Place the proximal jejunum under a wet gauze on the rat's right and the distal jejunum on the rat's left.\nStapling the stomach\n\t\nInsert a 45 mm linear cutting stapler with 3.5 mm staple height across the white line of the forestomach to create a smaller pouch. Wait for 10 s before firing the stapler.\nPlace pressure using gauze on the staple lines for 1 min to ensure hemostasis. If hemostasis is not achieved with pressure alone, bleeding along the staple line is oversewn using 6-0 polypropylene figure of eight sutures.\nPerform a second staple fire across the stomach into the window created previously. Wait for 10 s before firing the stapler. Pressure is held along the staple line to ensure hemostasis, and oversewing may be needed.\nGastrojejunostomy\n\t\nMake a gastrotomy immediately after stapling the stomach. Delays in this can cause gastric distension and aspiration as the stomach is discontinuous after the second gastric staple.\nUsing an 11-blade scalpel, create a gastrotomy at the distal pouch. Express gastric contents through the gastrotomy. This is important to prevent gastric distension and aspiration. Lengthen this gastrotomy using micro scissors to approximately 5 mm. The gastrotomy is made large enough for the cotton swab tip just to fit through.\nMobilize the distal end of the jejunum adjacent to the gastrotomy and place such that the mesentery is not twisted.\nWhile suturing the anastomosis, ensure that the bowel is kept moist by covering it with saline-soaked gauze and reapplying saline regularly.\nUsing 6-0 polydioxanone or polypropylene suture, place a stay suture at the inferior margin of the anastomosis and gently retract using a snap. Tie with three knots.",
    "Place a stay suture at the superior margin of the anastomosis and gently retract using a snap. Tie with six knots.\nSuture the anterior side of the anastomosis in a continuous fashion, taking bites 1 mm wide and 1 mm apart with care to avoid taking the backside.\nOnce the suture has reached the inferior stay suture, tie these together with an additional six knots.\nOnce the anterior side is complete, flip the bowel and stomach over and pass the inferior stay suture through the mesenteric defect. Reapply the snap and retract inferiorly.\nFor the posterior side of the anastomosis, place full thickness interrupted 6-0 sutures, 1 mm wide, and spaced 1 mm apart, with care to avoid taking the backside. These are tied with six knots each.\n\t\tNOTE: The anterior side of the anastomosis is sutured in a continuous fashion while the posterior side is done in an interrupted fashion. This prevents potential stricture or stenosis associated with a continuous circumferential closure.\nCheck for the leakage by gently pushing luminal contents across the anastomosis. If there are areas with leakage, carefully reinforce them with interrupted sutures. Take care to avoid taking the backwall when reinforcing with extra sutures.\nJejunojejunostomy\n\t\nFrom the gastrojejunostomy, measure 20 cm distally.\nCreate a jejunotomy on the antimesenteric side using the 11-blade scalpel. Avoid making the jejunotomy over Peyer's patches.\nExtend this jejunotomy using micro scissors, such that it is the same size as the biliopancreatic limb. Ensure that a cotton swab just fits inside.\nPlace the biliopancreatic limb such that there is no twisting of the mesentery.\nPerform the anastomosis similarly to the gastrojejunostomy with 6-0 stay sutures on the superior and inferior sides. The anterior side is performed with continuous sutures while the posterior side is performed with interrupted sutures.",
    "Ensure that the bowel is kept moist with saline during this anastomosis.\nCheck for leakage by gently pushing luminal contents through the anastomosis. If there are areas with leakage, reinforce them with interrupted sutures.\nReposition the bowel and stomach\n\t\nEnsure that there is no twisting of the pouch, remnant stomach, or liver. Ensure that the left lobe of the liver is anterior to the stomach and not trapped behind the pouch as this can cause compressive liver ischemia.\nPosition the bowel in the abdomen in its natural position such that there is no twisting.\nAbdominal closure\n\t\nClose the fascia with 3-0 polyglactin in a continuous fashion. 3-0 polydioxanone may also be used.\nClose the skin with 2-0 silk in a continuous fashion.\nAnesthetic emergence\n\t\nDecrease isoflurane to zero but continue supplemental oxygen.\nAdminister a local anesthetic as a splash block to the incision.\nAdminister 10 mL of subcutaneous 5% dextrose in normal saline (D5NS) in the subcutaneous tissue behind the neck.\nPlace an Elizabethan rat collar before the rat is fully awake. Take care to fit it snugly but not too tight to cause discomfort.\n\t\t​NOTE: The collar is kept on until day 5 to prevent wound dehiscence.\n2. Sham surgery\nNOTE: Sham surgery is performed similar to RYGB, however, no anastomoses are performed.\nA gastrotomy is created and then closed with 6-0 polydioxanone or polypropylene sutures.\nA jejunotomy is created 7 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz and then closed with 6-0 polydioxanone or polypropylene sutures.\n3. Postoperative care\nPostoperative care\n\t\nHouse rats individually and keep them on raised wire platforms until solid food is reintroduced to prevent consumption of bedding and luminal obstruction.\n\t\tNOTE: Postoperative diet is resumed gradually as edema at the gastrojejunostomy can cause obstruction with the early resumption of solid diet.",
    "Inspect the feet daily while rats are on raised wire platforms for any skin changes.\nKeep rats on water and oral rehydration therapy diet for the first 72 h.\nAdminister 10 mL of D5NS every 12 h for the first 72 h.\nAdminister subcutaneous short-acting buprenorphine at 0.01 mg/kg if rats appear to be in pain. The Rat Grimace Scale is used to assess for pain16.\nOn postoperative day 3, add rodent liquid diet. Continue to provide water and oral rehydration therapy.\nOn postoperative day 5, restart high-fat diet. Continue to provide water and liquid diet. Remove the Elizabethan collar.\nOn postoperative day 7, discontinue liquid diet.\nRemove skin sutures on postoperative day 10-14.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
