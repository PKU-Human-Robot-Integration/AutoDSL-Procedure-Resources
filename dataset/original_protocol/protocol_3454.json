    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTransfection of HK-2 cells: day 1 and day 2\nTiming: 2 days\nCells are seeded in a sterile 6-well plate and transfect with SQSTM1/p62 overexpression plasmid and its control plasmid pcDNA3.1 (+).\nDay 1: Plate 5 × 104 HK-2 cells in a sterile 6-well plate with 2 mL of growth medium (DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum) without antibiotics so that cells will be approximately 60%–80% confluency at the time of transfection.\nDay 2: For each transfection samples, prepare complexes as follows:\nDilute 3.75 μL Lipofectamine 3000 with 125 μL Opti-MEM and mix gently.\nDilute 2500 ng DNA in 125 μL of Opti-MEM without serum, then add 5 μL p3000 to it and mix gently.\nCombine the diluted Lipofectamine 3000 with diluted DNA and mix gently. Incubate for 5 min at 20°C–25°C. After 5 min incubation, add the complexes to each well containing cells and medium. Incubate cells in a cell culture incubator with a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C for 24 h.\nNote: For complete details of SQSTM1/p62 overexpression plasmid, please refer to our previous work (Ma et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). Compared with control plasmid, transfected with SQSTM1/p62 overexpression plasmid will increase the mitochondrial OXPHOS, which results in the increases of basal and maximal respiratory capacity, spare respiratory capacity, and ATP-linked OCR.\nNote: It is not necessary to change the medium after transfection, but medium may be replaced after 24 h.\nSeeding cells and hydrating sensory cartridge: day 3\nTiming: 2–3 h\nSeed the treated cells in the Seahorse XF96 Cell Culture Microplate, hydrate the XF extracellular flux sensory cartridge and turn on the Seahorse instrument (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/341-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "Cell seeding\nHarvest and plate 6 × 103 HK-2 cells in 100 μL growth medium (DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin and streptomycin) per well (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A), except four background temperature correction wells (A1, A12, H1, and H12) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]), which should be blanked with 100 μL of growth medium.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/341-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Experimental operation in a well of a microplate and the interface connecting the Seahorse XFe96 extracellular flux analyzer to the computer\n(A) Cell seeding and liquid aspiration handling in a well of the Seahorse XF96 cell culture microplate.\n(B) In the lower-left corner of the Wave Controller software, you can verify the instrument connection status.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/341-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Four background correction wells in the Seahorse XF96 cell culture microplate (A1, A12, H1, H12)\nBe sure that background correction wells contain medium only (no cells).\nAllow the plate to rest at 20°C–25°C in the tissue culture hood for 1 h. This can promote cell to distribute even and reduce edge effects for cells. Then, incubate the cells for 12–18 h in a cell culture incubator.\nNote: Optimal cell seeding density varies by cell type, but is typically between 5 × 103 and 4 × 104 cells per well for adherent cells. Generally, cell confluence between 80% and 90% will generate metabolic rates in the desirable range of the instrument.\nNote: You must ensure your background wells do not contain cells.\nNote: The key factors in cell seeding for accurate measurement are that the cells should be plated as uniform as possible and the plate must rest at 20°C–25°C in tissue culture hood for 1 h to minimize the edge effect (Lundholt et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).",
    "Note: Put the pipette tip on the edge of the lower well but not contact with the bottom of the well when seeding the cells. Do not resuspend the cells after seeding them in the XF96 Cell Culture Microplate.\nHydrate sensory cartridge\nSeparate the utility plate and sensory cartridge, and place the sensory cartridge upside down on the bench side to the utility plate (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/341-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Cartridge lid, sensory cartridge, and utility plate\nPlace sensory cartridge upside down on the bench and avoid contact with the sensors.\nFill each well of the utility plate with 200 μL Seahorse XF Calibrant, then lower the sensory cartridge back onto the utility plate gently and avoid creating air bubbles.\nIncubate the sensory cartridge in a non-CO2, 37°C incubator for 12–18 h. Make sure the environment of the incubator is humidified.\nNote: Be careful not to contact of the sensory cartridge and ensure submerging the sensors in the calibration.\nPower on the Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer, non-CO2, 37°C incubator and computer, then open the “Wave” software (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) and click the “Heater on.”\nNote: Observe whether the temperature in the software is rising to 37°C. When the icon in the lower-left corner of the “connected” turns green indicating that the instrument connection status is normal (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). The Seahorse instruments must turn on at least 5 h prior to run the assay.\nDay of the assay: day 4\nTiming: 5–6 h\nPrepare the Seahorse assay medium, cells, and XF Cell Stress Test Compounds for running the assay.\nPrepare the Seahorse assay medium.\nTurn on the water bath and warm to 37°C.\nAdd 1 mL 100mM pyruvate solution, 1 mL 200 mM glutamine solution and 0.1 g D-glucose in 98 mL XF base medium. Filtrate the assay medium with 0.22 μm filter.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_341_2.csv",
    "Warm the assay medium to 37°C and adjust to pH 7.4 with 1 M NaOH.\nNote: The assay medium must be prepared when it will be used and keep 37°C prior to use. Do not prepare too much assay medium, 100 mL is sufficient for one XF96 Cell Culture Microplate.\nWash cells\nRetrieve the XF96 Cell Culture Microplate from the cell incubator.\nRemove cell growth medium with 20 μL remaining and replace with 180 μL of assay medium, repeat 3 times.\nThe last time, aspirate 180 μL of assay medium and replace with 160 μL of assay medium.\nTo de-gas, incubate the XF96 Cell Culture Microplate in a 37°C incubator without CO2 for 1 h.\nNote: The cells must be incubated in a 37°C incubator without CO2 for 1 h to de-gas prior to replacing the XF96 Cell Culture Microplate on the tray.\nPrepare and load XF Cell Stress Test Compounds\nSuspend the compounds with assay medium according to Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_341_3.csv\nDilute the stock solutions of and Oligomycin, FCCP and Rotenone/antimycin A according to Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2], then load 20 μL of 2 μM oligomycin in port A, 22 μL of 1 μM FCCP in port B and 25 μL of 0.5 μM Rotenone/antimycin A in port C of the hydrated sensory cartridge.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_341_4.csv\nNote: The compounds must be prepared and loaded 20 min prior to the assay.\nNote: The recommended concentration of Oligomycin and Rotenone/antimycin A can meet most cell types. The maximum respiratory rate is caused by injection of uncoupler FCCP, so if OCR is not increased following the FCCP injection, you should perform a careful titration of FCCP to optimized the appropriate concentration.\nRun assay\nSelect XF Cell Mito Stress Test on the Templates window and set up the program as follows:",
    "At the Plate map page, click “add group” and select corresponding wells to edit the information of your group.\nAt the Protocol page, the parameters are as follows: baseline, 3 cycles; inject port A (oligomycin), 3 cycles; inject port B (FCCP), 3 cycles; inject port C (Rotenone/antimycin A), 3 cycles. Each cycle is composed of mix 3 min, wait 0 min, and measure 3 min (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/341-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. The interface of a typical running protocol and experimental parameters\nAt the Run Assay page, select “Start Run” and choose a location to save your assay result file. The tray will auto-eject and put the sensory cartridge on it, the instrument will initiate the calibration of the sensory cartridge. Time to complete calibration is approximately 20 min.\nWhen the calibration is over, click “open the tray,” remove the utility plate and replace the XF96 Cell Culture Microplate on the tray with the correct direction as labeled on corner of the plate, which should be located at the lower-left corner of the tray, then load the tray.\nNote: The default XF Cell Mito Stress Test protocol does not require modifications. The total time of OCR measurements is 1 h 24 min. If the readings are very slow the cells will have reduced viability which will affect the results.\nCritical: Before start the assay, make sure that the compounds should be injected in the port. View cells under a microscope to ensure the cell health, seeding confluence, and ensure your background wells do not contain cells.\nData Analysis\nRemove the cell plate and the sensory cartridges when the run is completed.\nInsert a USB drive and export the results.\nResults will be automatically generated and analysis by the wave software, which can export your data as an Excel or Prism file.
