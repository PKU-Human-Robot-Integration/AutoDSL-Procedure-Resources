    "This protocol provides detailed step-by-step instructions for the purification of residual bodies (RBs) from four adult mice. It is divided in several sub-protocols: steps 1 to 10 provide information for preparation of a sucrose gradient; steps 11 to 23 describe preparation of single germ cell/RB suspension; steps 24 to 28 explain how to load and centrifuge the suspension through the sucrose gradient cushion; steps 29 to 37 focus on fraction collection; and steps 38 to 60 describe two methods for evaluation of purity of the RB fractions.\nMaterials\nSucrose solutions (see recipe)\nFour adult male mice (e.g., FVB/NJ strain), aged 8 to 12 weeks\n70% (v/v) ethanol\n0.4% Trypan blue stain (Invitrogen, cat. no.

Place dry ice in the polystyrene box and place a stainless-steel tube rack that tightly fits 13.2-ml thin wall polypropylene gradient tubes (i.e., no movement)\nHandle dry ice with caution i.e., wearing thermostat gloves and eye protection.\n2. Put at least 2 gradient tubes into the tube rack and chill for 5 min.\nMultiple gradient tubes can be prepared at the same time and stored at –80°C for future use.\n3. Carefully add 1.5 ml of 1.9 M sucrose solution to the bottom of the tubes.\nPipette the 1.9 M sucrose solution slowly using a 1-ml tip to avoid drawing an inaccurate volume due to its viscosity. Do not pipette the solution on the side of the tube wall and try to avoid air bubbles.",
    "4. Cover the top of the tubes with cling wrap to avoid the introduction of any foreign material, such as ice from the −80°C freezer.\n5. Carefully place the rack into a –80°C freezer and incubate for 30 min to completely freeze the 1.9 M sucrose solution.\nTry to avoid any sudden movement, which might disturb the gradients.\n6. Take out the rack and put it back on dry ice and remove the cling wrap.\n7. Add 1.5 ml of 1.2 M sucrose solution on top of the frozen 1.9 M sucrose, cover it with a new cling wrap, and put it back at –80°C for 30 min.\nPipette the 1.2 M sucrose solution slowly using a 1-ml tip to avoid drawing an inaccurate volume due to its viscosity. Do not pipette the solution on the side of the tube wall and try to avoid air bubbles.\n8. Add 2.5 ml of 1.0 M and 0.8 M of sucrose solutions sequentially following the preceding step 7.\nFreezing time for 1.0 M and 0.8 M sucrose solutions during the gradient formation can be reduced to 15 min each.\n9. Seal the tubes with parafilm and store at –80°C for up to 1 month or overnight if proceeding to step 11.\nMultiple gradients can be prepared at once and stored in a –80°C freezer for future use.\n10. Take out the tubes containing the gradient (from step 9) in the evening before the RB purification experiment and keep them at 4°C, which will allow to thaw and form a continuous gradient.\nKeep the gradient tubes at 4°C for at least 8 hr.\nPreparation of single germ cell/residual body suspension",
    "Four adult mice (8 to 12 weeks old for better yield) of desired strain background should be used. This protocol uses a germ cell suspension from eight testes of adult FVB/NJ strain of mice for loading into two continuous sucrose gradients.\n11. Sacrifice mice by cervical dislocation and wet the lower abdomen area with 70% (v/v) ethanol.\n12. Open the mouse peritoneal cavity using surgical scissors and expose the testes by pulling out the epididymal fat pads [for steps 12 to 15, follow the instructions provided in the video from Kim et al. (2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.920#cpz1920-bib-0007])].\n13. Cut the ductus deferens while holding the epididymal fat pads and release the testes by cutting the fat pads leaving a small portion still attached to the testes.\nFrom now on, all steps must be conducted in a cold room or on ice (we perform this protocol in a cold room).\n14. Transfer the testes to a small sterile tissue culture dish containing 3 ml of cold 0.25 M sucrose solution.\nAlways keep the testes immersed in cold 0.25 M sucrose solution.\n15. Make a small incision on the tunica albuginea while securing the testis by holding the remaining fat pads with tweezers and squeeze the tubules out.\n16. Gently spread the tubules with curved tweezers and rinse them in the same solution to release the interstitial and blood cells. Place the rinsed tubules in a new small tissue culture dish containing 2 ml of cold 0.25 M sucrose solution.\n17. Cut the tubules with fine end surgical scissors for 5 min (∼150 cuts/min) and then with a surgical blade for 3 to 5 min to achieve the size of tubule fragments of ∼1 mm.",
    "It is important to use a no. 22 surgical blade (or similar round edge blade) to avoid scraping off plastic flakes from the bottom of the tissue culture dish.\n18. Cut ∼2 mm off a 1-ml tip and pipette the cell suspension for 2 to 3 min using the cut tip.\nAt this stage no tubular fragment should get stuck at the opening of the tip. If it happens, then cut the tubules with the blade again.\n19. Transfer the cell suspension into a 15-ml polypropylene tube, repeatedly wash the culture dish with 0.25 M sucrose solution to collect all the cells and make the volume 8 ml after washing.\nKeep using the same tip in order to minimize cell loss.\n20. Filter the suspension twice using 100-μm filters and wash the tube with 2 ml of 0.25 M cold sucrose solution after each filtration step, so the final volume is 12 ml.\nIf required, a 1-ml syringe plunger can be used to gently massage cells through the membrane to expedite the process.\n21. Spin the filtrate in a benchtop, refrigerated centrifuge 20 min at 1800 × g, 4°C.\nThis speed of 1800 × g allows the RBs to settle.\n22. Decant and discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellets in 2 ml of 0.25 M cold sucrose solution via pipetting up and down for 1 min using a cut 1 ml tip.\nBe very gentle during the resuspension step to avoid cell lysis.\n23. Bring the volume up to 9 ml and count the cells using a trypan blue stain and a countess cell counter.\nExpect to obtain ∼2 × 108 cells with >80% viability from the testes of 4 adult mice.\nLoading the gradient with cell suspension and ultracentrifugation",
    "This step is performed in a cold room. Load no more than 1.25 × 108 cells into each sucrose gradient tube in order to prevent overloading.\n24. Place one gradient tube at a time into the clamp of the retort stand and tighten it to secure the tube.\n25. Cut the end of a 1 ml tip and attach a long 200-µl non-filtered gel loading tip to it to have more control during the gradient loading\nIt is important to use the 200-µl gel loading tip to avoid any disturbance of gradient during the loading of cell suspension.\n26. Pipette 1 ml of cell suspension and load on top of the gradient very slowly without disturbing the gradient; continue the process and load up to 4.2 ml of cell suspension in total (equivalent to 100 to 125 million cells per gradient tube).\nGently mix the cell suspension each time before loading\n27. Weigh each gradient tube and equilibrate the weight with the other gradient tubes using 0.25 M cold sucrose solution in order to balance the centrifuge.\nA maximum of 100 mg weight difference between tubes is acceptable for a safe ultracentrifugation process.\n28. Once the gradient tubes have been loaded with cell suspension, ultracentrifuge the tubes using an SW41Ti rotor 45 min at 91,000 × g (23,000 rpm), 4°C.\nAcceleration and deacceleration parameters of the ultracentrifuge should be set up as ‘maximum’ and ‘slow,’ respectively.\nFraction collection\n29. Number 20 × 2-ml microcentrifuge tubes from 1 to 20 and keep them in the cold room.\n30. Remove the bevel of the needle by cutting the 19G needle end using pliers, and then restoring the opening to its original width with the smooth edge of the pliers. Attach the needle to a 1-ml syringe.",
    "Handle sharp objects with care in accordance with the institutional sharp handling procedure. The syringe can be washed and re-used.\n31. Once ultracentrifugation is complete, gently transfer all the tubes to the cold room.\n32. Gently place one gradient tube into the clamp and start collecting fractions from the top of each gradient.\nTry to keep the needle opening on the very top of the solution during every collection.\nFraction collection process must be slow and steady. Too much suction pressure will disturb the gradient, resulting in the mixing of different fractions.\n33. Collect 500 µl per fraction into 2.0-ml microcentrifuge tubes, up to 18 fractions. There is no need to collect any fractions residing in the 1.9 M sucrose solution.\n34. Observe each fraction by phase contrast microscopy to visually assess the level of purity of each fraction.\nFractions 13 to 15 should contain the purest RBs. Although the majority of fraction 16 represents RBs, the proportion of contaminating germ cells is considerably higher compared to that in fractions 13 to 15 (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.920#cpz1920-fig-0002]).\nThe numbers of fractions indicated here containing pure RBs might be slightly different from one experiment to another due to slight difference in the volume of cell loading into the gradient or slightly different fraction volume.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f05d32d2-8fb5-415c-8242-5bc32f3e29d7/cpz1920-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nEvaluation of fraction purity with DAPI staining. Representative microscopy images of RB fractions 13-16 and their level of purity. (A-D) Images are taken using UV and bright field settings to visualize DAPI staining and particle morphology. RBs are DAPI-negative but clearly seen in the bright field. RB fractions 13-15 are the purest with contamination that is represented by round, elongating spermatid and pachytene spermatocytes. (E) Calculated purity level of RB fractions 13-16. Values are defined as mean ± SD.",
    "35. Add 1 ml of cold 0.05 M phosphate buffer to dilute the sucrose solution and pellet the desired fractions (i.e., fractions 13 to 15) in a refrigerated microcentrifuge for 30 min at 1800 × g, 4°C.\n36. Following centrifugation, snap freeze the pellets and store at –80°C or proceed to step 37.\n37. Proceed to perform any downstream analysis i.e., immunofluorescent labeling, protein or RNA extraction.\nEvaluation of purity of fractions\nDAPI staining of purified residual body fractions\n38. At the end of fractionation process, add 1 ml of cold 0.05 M phosphate buffer into each fraction.\n39. Pellet the RBs for 15 min at 1800 × g, 4°C, using a refrigerated microcentrifuge.\n40. Repeat steps 38 and 39 once more.\n41. Resuspend the RBs pellet in 200 µl of cold phosphate buffer.\n42. Spot 10 µl RBs on a poly-L-lysine coated glass slide.\n43. Fix with 10 µl of a 4% PFA + 0.05% Triton X-100 solution (v/v in DPBS) for 20 min at room temperature in a humidified chamber.\nWe make a humidified chamber by placing several layers of paper towels prewet with deionized water on the bottom of the plastic container with tightly sealed lid.\n44. Wash with 1× DPBS twice.\n45. Stain with DAPI (diluted 1:2500 in ddH2O) for 3 min in the dark at room temperature.\n46. Wash with 1× DPBS twice.\n47. Mount with Vectashield Plus antifade mounting medium (30 µl per 20 mm × 50 mm coverslip, seal with nail polish).\n48. Examine via fluorescence microscopy using differential interference contrast function (Fig. 2A to D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.920#cpz1920-fig-0002]).\nImmunofluorescent labeling of purified residual bodies with anti-H2A.B3 antibody\n49. Add 10 µl of 4% PFA + 0.05% Triton X-100 (v/v in DPBS) onto a poly-L-lysine coated slide.",
    "50. Add an equal volume of the RBs suspension and spread the mixture over the slide.\n51. Fix for 1 hr at room temperature in a humidified chamber.\n52. Remove the fixative and block with 5% donkey serum + 0.01% Tween 20 in 1× DPBS for 1 hr at room temperature.\n53. Incubate with anti-H2A.B3 antibody diluted 1:100 in 5% donkey serum + 0.01% Tween 20 in 1× DPBS overnight at 4°C in a humidified chamber.\n54. On the following day, wash the slide with 1× DPBS + 0.01% Tween 20 in a 50-ml Coplin jar, three times for 5 min each.\n55. Incubate with a secondary antibody (anti-sheep Cy3 diluted 1:200 in 5% donkey serum + 0.01% Tween 20 in 1× DPBS) in a humidified chamber for 45 min at 37°C in the dark.\n56.
