    "Template preparation for in vitro transcriptionClone the DNA template encoding the RNA of interest derived by a T7 promoter in a plasmid vector and linearize the plasmid at a site downstream of the DNA template using specific restriction enzyme.Run the linearized plasmid DNA on a 0.8% agarose gel, excise the band and extract the linearized DNA for in vitro transcription.Alternatively use a T7 promoter-adapter containing forward primer and gene specific reverse primer to amplify target DNA incorporating T7 promoter for in vitro transcription (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170315/20170315031828_6600.jpgFigure 1. Preparation of template DNA for transcription using T7 promoterFor oligo driven transcription of short RNAs, commercially synthesized template DNA oligo with T7 promoter site is annealed with a T7 promoter-adapter oligo to generate the template for in vitro transcription (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170315/20170315031935_7346.jpgFigure 2. Preparation of DNA template for oligo-driven transcriptionP32UTP body-labelled RNA preparation (proper biosafety protocol should be followed)Setup the following in vitro transcription reaction using α-P32UTP as radiolabeltable:\n﻿0,1\n10x transcription buffer,2 μl\n10 mM ATP,1 μl\n10 mM CTP,1 μl\n10 mM GTP,1 μl\n100 μM UTP,1 μl\nα-P32 UTP,2 μl\nLinearized DNA template,10 μl (~1 µg)\nT7 RNA polymerase,2 μl",
    "Incubate for 1 h 30 min at 37 °C.Add 1 μl DNase I (optional) to remove the DNA template. Incubate at 37 °C for 15 min.Remove unincorporated nucleotides either by ethanol precipitation or column purification. For ethanol precipitation, add 29 μl nuclease free water to the transcription reaction to bring the volume to 50 μl. Add 5 μl 5 M ammonium acetate, 2 μg glycogen and 2 volumes of 100% ethanol, and precipitate at -80 °C for at least 2 h. Spin for 20 min at maximum speed in a 4 °C centrifuge and wash the pellet once with cold 70% ethanol before drying.Dissolve the dried RNA pellet in 20 μl nuclease free water. Take 1 μl of labelled RNA and count the specific activity with a scintillation counter or run on an 8 M urea-polyacrylamide gel at the percentage appropriate for the size of the RNA.RNA-protein binding and UV crosslinkingSetup the following binding reaction for each sample in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes on icetable:\n﻿0,1\n2x RNA binding buffer (with 3 mM ATP),6 μl\n10 mg/ml yeast tRNA,1 μl\nRadiolabeled RNA,\"x μl (~100,000 cpm)\"\nRNase inhibitor (40 U/μl),0.5 μl\nPurified protein/cell lysate,x μl (minimum 50 ng)\nNuclease free water,to make up the volume to 12 µl",
    "Incubate on ice for 30 min.Carefully transfer to a precooled 96-well round-bottomed plate placed on ice.Place the plate containing the reaction mixture under the UV light source of UV crosslinker or UV torch and apply 500 mJ/cm2 radiation for 10 min on ice.Transfer the reaction to 1.5 ml tubes.Add 2 µl RNase A (10 μg/μl) and incubate the tubes for 30 min at 37 °C.Separation of RNA-protein complex and visualization (Figure 3)Add 13 μl of 2x denaturing protein loading buffer.Boil the samples for 5 min at 100 °C and resolve in 10% SOD-PAGE with pre-stained protein markers or radiolabeled protein markers.Dry the gel and expose overnight to a phosphorimager screen.Scan the screen in a phosphorimager.Alternatively expose the dried gel to X-ray film for 24 h and develop the film. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170315/20170315032804_2866.jpgFigure 3. UV-crosslinking of 32P labelled PDCD4-3’UTR RNA with 500 ng of purified 6x His-tagged HuR protein (lane 1) and in the presence of 10x (lane 2) and 100x unlabelled PDCD4 3’UTR RNA. RNA-protein complexes were digested with RNase A and resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE and exposed for phosphorimaging. The HuR-32P PDCD4-3’UTR RNA complexes are indicated by the arrow."
