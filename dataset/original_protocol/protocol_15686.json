    "All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of UConn Health and conducted in accordance with US guidelines. The following protocol should work in any species or strain of rodent. Here, 8- to 12-week-old, age- and weight-matched C57BL/6 wild-type male mice were used. Mice were fed standard chow diet and water ad libitum. Standard housing conditions were maintained at 72.3 °F and 30%-70% relative humidity with a 12 h light/dark cycle.\n1. Pre-surgery preparation\nSterilize all instruments by autoclaving prior to surgery. Sanitize the operating surface with 70% ethanol and warm the operating surface to 37 °C with an electric heating pad.\nUse an induction chamber to anesthetize the mouse with 4%-5% isoflurane for induction. Deliver 1.5%-2.0% isoflurane via nose cone for maintenance until the end of surgery. Ensure prior to surgery that the mouse is properly anesthetized by assessing the lack of a response to a firm hind foot pinch and loss of the postural reaction and righting reflex.\nPlace the mouse on its left side on the operating surface and apply eye ointment to protect both eyes.\nShave hair over the surgical field (i.e., right lateral cranium between eye and ear) with electric clippers. Clean the surgical field in concentric circles outward from the middle of the surgical site, with 70% ethanol followed by povidone solution, and repeat these steps 2x.\n\tNOTE: Due to the surgery site being close to the eye, removing 150% of the area surrounding a surgical site may not be possible to avoid irritation or accidental injury to the eye.\nAdminister a single dose of 0.25% bupivacaine (up to 8 mg/kg body weight) by subcutaneous injection as pre-operative analgesia at the site of surgery.\nSet up a surgical microscope at 4x magnification. The microscope is used for all surgical steps.",
    "2. Surgery procedure\nNOTE: The surgery steps are presented in Figure 1. For this protocol, three mice were allocated to sham group, three mice for EMS alone, 12 mice for MCAo, and 23 mice for MCAo + EMS group.\nMCAo surgery\n\tNOTE: MCAo is a well-characterized model of ischemic stroke in rodents, as described by us and others12,13,14. The surgery steps are described in brief here. Focal transient cerebral ischemia was induced by a 60 min right MCAo under isoflurane anesthesia followed by reperfusion for 7 or 21 days.\n\t\nMake a midline ventral neck incision followed by unilateral right MCAo by advancing a 10-11 mm long 6.0 silicone rubber-coated monofilament from the internal carotid artery bifurcation via an external carotid artery stump. In sham mice, perform identical surgeries except for the advancement of the suture into the internal carotid artery.\nMeasure rectal temperatures using a temperature control system, maintaining the temperature at ~37 °C during surgery with an automatic heating pad.\nUse laser Doppler flowmetry to measure cerebral blood flow prior to suture insertion by placing the Doppler probe against the lateral skull (corresponding to the MCA territory) and recording the value8. To confirm occlusion reduction to 15% of baseline cerebral blood flow, use the same procedure after the suture is advanced. To confirm reperfusion, use the same procedure after the suture is removed.\nFeed all animals with wet mash until sacrifice and/or 1 week after surgery to ensure adequate nutrition for chronic endpoints, as animals have rearing deficits after stroke.\nEMS surgery\n\t\nAfter 60 min of MCAo, randomize mice into MCAo-only or MCAo + EMS groups. Perform EMS 4 h after MCAo (MCAo + EMS group) or sham surgery for select experiments (EMS-only group). Change into a new pair of sterile surgical gloves before the surgery.",
    "NOTE: The mice recovered from anesthesia after 60 minutes of MCAo and were re-anesthetized before the EMS surgery.\nFor groups that receive EMS (MCAo + EMS or EMS-only groups), make a 10-15 mm skin incision with scissors, extending from 1-2 mm rostral to the right ear to 1-2 mm caudal to the right eye.\n\t\tNOTE: Sterile scissors were used to prevent accidental damage to the temporalis muscles underneath.\nRetract skin flaps using clamps and visually identify the temporalis muscle and the skull.\nBluntly dissect the temporalis muscle away from the skull using scissors with a spreading technique. Perform a 2-3 mm myotomy directed ventrally along the caudal border of the muscle to facilitate ventral reflection.\nPerform a craniotomy ~5 mm in diameter at the skull underneath the reflected temporalis muscle using a micro drill.\nRemove the dura mater with tweezers to expose the pial surface of the brain. Use extreme caution to avoid accidental injury to the brain.\nSuture the dorsal border of the temporalis muscle to the subcutaneous tissue of the dorsal skin flap with 6-0 monocryl filaments, making it flush to the exposed cerebral cortex.\nClose the skin incision with 6-0 monofilament suture. Place the mouse back into its cage and monitor until recovery from anesthesia. Return the mouse to its housing facility.\n3. Post-operative considerations\nMonitor the mice for illness and the surgical site for infection daily. Give subcutaneous normal saline (1% volume by body weight) daily to support hydration.\nMonitor for severe dehydration (loss of body weight >20%) until 7 days after surgery. Administer an additional bolus of subcutaneous normal saline 1% volume by body weight if >20% weight loss.\nProceed with injections, physiologic monitoring, and other testing without special considerations.",
    "NOTE: In this procedure, the use of opioids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to treat post-surgery was avoided due to the known effects of these agents on stroke outcome or infarct size in consultation with in-house institutional animal care and use committee15,16,17,18. However, the use of post-operative analgesia is highly encouraged for EMS surgery with other models. Please consult the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) for this.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
