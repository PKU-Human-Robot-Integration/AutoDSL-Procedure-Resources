    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe protocol describes the strategy for generating conditional yeast mutants in which it can produce de novo LDs. We detail the description of how to perform gene KO using a marker rescue strategy, method to introduce GAL1 promoter at endogenous locus upstream of ARE1, and how to engineer C-terminally tagged ERG6-mCherry fusion driven by its endogenous promoter. Thus, we generated yeast strain GAL-ARE1 lro1Δ dga1Δ are2Δ ERG6-mCherry (3Δ GAL-ARE1 Erg6-mCherry). Similar strategy can construct any of the acyltransferase under galactose inducible promoter.\nTransformation of gene KO cassette\nTiming: 6–7 days\nThis step describes the transformation of wild-type (BY4741) yeast strain with gene KO cassette using Lithium Acetate (LiAc) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Perform gene KO sequentially to obtain the triple acyltransferase yeast mutant (lro1Δ dga1Δ are2Δ) by utilizing auxotrophic marker rescue strategy using Cre recombinase after successful deletion of every gene deletion.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3150-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

(C) Separation of PCR amplified product on 1% agarose gel to confirm the correct clone containing the desired KO.\nStreak wild-type yeast strain (BY4741) on a fresh YPD plate and incubate for 2 days at 30°C.\nCulture the strain in 10 mL of YPD media in a 50 mL tube for 16 h at 30°C with constant shaking at 200 rpm.",
    "Next morning, measure the OD600 using a spectrophotometer and dilute the cells to OD600 0.15 and grow until mid-log phase until it reaches OD600 1.\nHarvest the cells at 600 × g for 5 min and wash with 20 mL sterile H2O.\nCentrifuge the cells at 600 × g for 5 min and wash again with 20 mL 1X TE.\nSpin the cells at 600 g for 5 min and gently resuspend the pellet in 10 mL 1X LiAc solution and centrifuge again at 400 × g for 4 min.\nPour off the supernatant, gently resuspend the pellet in 1 mL LiAc solution and incubate the cells at 30°C for 30 min so that they become competent.\nWhile cells are being incubated, boil herring sperm DNA at 95°C for 10 min and keep on ice until use.\nAdd reagents in the sequential manner in a sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\n60–70 μL of competent yeast cells.\n10 μL herring sperm DNA (ice cold).\n5–10 μg of KO cassette (except in control tube, add the corresponding amount of water in control).\nGently mix and incubate at 30°C for 30 min.\nAdd 0.7 mL Polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution, mix by gentle pipetting or tapping, and incubate for 45 min at 25°C.\nCritical: Resuspend the cells gently by pipetting carefully, and avoid any shearing force, as this will reduce the transformation efficiency.\nHeat shock the cells for 12 min in water bath or dry bath at 42°C and put the tubes on ice for 5 min.\nCentrifuge at 600 × g for 4 min.\nCarefully remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet by adding 200 μL of sterile water.\nSpread the cells on SC-HIS plate using sterile glass spreader.\nIncubate the plates upside down at 30°C for 3–4 days for colonies to appear.",
    "Re-streak isolated 10–15 colonies on new SC-HIS plate and incubate at 30°C for 2 days.\nColony screening for verification of positive recombinants\nTiming: 3–5 h\nIsolation of genomic DNA (template for colony PCR).\nResuspend the single yeast colony or a patch mimicking a large single colony from the re-streaks in 100 μL of LiAc-SDS solution (see materials and methods).\nVortex vigorously at high speed, and incubate at 70°C in dry bath for 10 min.\nAdd 300 μL of absolute ethanol to the sample for DNA precipitation, vortex and collect the DNA by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 3 min.\nRemove supernatant and wash the pellet with 500 μL of 70% ethanol.\nCarefully remove the supernatant and let the pellet dry at 37°C until all the ethanol has evaporated.\nAdd 50 μL of sterile water and vortex to dissolve the pellet.\nCentrifuge at 15,000 × g for 1 min to pellet down the cell debris, use 1 μL of the supernatant as template for setting up the PCR reaction.\nSet up 50 μL reaction for colony PCR using the primers listed in Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]. Yeast genomic DNA serves as the template for the colony PCR (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C). PCR components and cycle condition as given in Tables 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl7] and 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl8], respectively.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3150_25.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3150_26.csv\nNote: Annealing temperature can be calculated by New England Biolabs (NEB) tm calculator using primer sequences given in Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3].\nRun the PCR product on 1% agarose gel to observe the desired product size (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nRe-streak at least two positive clones of each of the newly constructed yeast strain on either selective SC-HIS or YPD plates.\nPause point: Make a glycerol stock (25% final concentration) of the positive clones and store at ‒80°C.\nCre mediated recombination of loxP sites\nTiming: 8–10 days",
    "Perform marker rescue for sequential gene deletion by excising the auxotrophic HIS5 marker integrated at ARE2 locus by expressing Cre recombinase from a GAL inducible plasmid pSH47 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3150-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Schematics of marker rescue strategy\nIllustration showing step-by-step procedure of marker rescue. Expression of Cre-recombinase on a plasmid pSH47 driven by GAL1 promoter by culturing in the presence of galactose media for 2 h results in recombination between the two loxP sites. Therefore, HIS5 selection marker gets excised, leaving only one loxP site. Cells are plated on non-selective media, replica plated onto SC-HIS and SC + All. The clones that grow on SC + All but do not grow on SC-HIS are picked, streaked on YPD, and selected on plates containing 5-FOA to cure the plasmid pSH47. Clones that grow on 5-FOA are streaked onto SC-URA and YPD to confirm the loss of URA containing plasmid. Hence, the strain obtained is a clean KO.\nTransform the plasmid pSH47 (URA selection marker) expressing Cre recombinase in the are2Δ KO strain using transformation protocol as described in the previous section and plate on SC-URA.\nAfter 2–3 days colonies will appear. Pick a bunch of 4–6 colonies, resuspend in 2 mL of YP-Galactose media, and culture for 2 h at 30°C with constant shaking at 200 rpm to induce the expression of Cre recombinase.\nPlate 25 μL on the SC + ALL plates and incubate at 30°C for 2 days.\nNote: Plating too much of cells can cause overcrowding of colonies. To get isolated colonies, plate less volume on SC + ALL containing plates.",
    "Pick 20–30 individual colonies for replica plating by resuspending in 80 μL of SC + All media in a 96 well microtiter plate, and spotting 5 μL of the same colony on SC + ALL and SC-HIS plates.\nIncubate the plates upside down for 2–3 days at 30°C.\nNote: One can use 48 well spotter for replica plating. Orientation of both plates needs to be marked and identical spots on SC + ALL and SC-HIS need to be denoted with the same number. A clone that grows on SC + ALL but does not grow on SC-HIS is the correct clone as it has lost the HIS5 cassette.\nStreak two positive clones from SC + ALL onto YPD plates for 24–48 h at 30°C.\nTo cure the plasmid pSH47 with URA selection marker, streak the clone that has lost HIS5 marker onto SC + ALL plates containing or lacking 5-FOA.\nYeast URA- cells will grow on 5-FOA, whereas URA+ cells will die due to buildup of toxic products in the presence of 5-FOA.\nClones that survive are the ones that have lost the plasmid pSH47.\nTo confirm URA- phenotype, yeast strains need to be streaked on plates containing SC-URA and SC + ALL by replica plating.\nPick the positive clones from SC + ALL plates and streak on a new non-selective plate.\nPerform subsequent gene deletion using the same HIS5 auxotrophic marker to generate double or a triple yeast mutant lro1Δ dga1Δ are2Δ ARE1 (3ΔKO).\nAfter final marker rescue, HIS5 would be free for subsequent usage.\nStrategy to insert galactose inducible promoter upstream of ARE1\nTiming: 3–5 days\nNext, we perform insertion of galactose inducible promoter, GAL1 upstream of ARE1 gene to regulate transcriptional activation of SE acyltransferase ARE1 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3150-Fig4.jpg",
