    "All experimental methods have been approved by the McGill University Research Ethics Board and subjects sign informed consents before participating.\n1. Experiments\nNOTE: Each experiment involves the following steps.\nPre-test\n\t\nPrepare a definite outline of all trials to be performed and make a checklist for data collection.\nProvide the subject with a consent form with all the necessary information, ask them to read it thoroughly, answer any questions, and then have them sign the form.\nRecord the subject’s weight, height, and age.\nSubject preparation\n\t\nElectromyography measurement\n\t\t\nUse single differential electrodes (Table of Materials) with an inter-electrode distance of 1 cm for the measurement of electromyography (EMG) of ankle muscles.\nUse an amplifier (Table of Materials) with an overall gain of 1000 and a bandwidth of 20−2000 Hz.\nTo ensure a high signal to noise ratio (SNR) and minimal cross-talk, locate and mark the electrode attachment areas according to guidelines provided by the Seniam project26, as below: (1) for the medial gastrocnemius (MG), the most prominent bulge of the muscle; (2) for the lateral gastrocnemius (LG), 1/3 of the line between the head of the fibula and the heel; (3) for soleus (SOL), 2/3 of the line between the medial condyles of the femur and the medial malleolus; (4) for tibialis anterior (TA), 1/3 of the line between the tip of the fibula and the tip of the medial malleolus.\nShave the marked areas with a razor and clean the skin with alcohol. Allow the skin to dry thoroughly.\nShave a bony area on the patella for the reference electrode, and clean with alcohol.\nHave the subject lie in a relaxed supine position.\nPlace the reference electrode on the shaved area of the patella.",
    "Attach the electrodes one by one to the shaved areas of the muscles, using double sided tape, taking care to ensure that the electrodes are fixed to the skin securely.\nAfter placing each electrode, ask the subject to perform a plantarflexing/dorsiflexing contraction against resistance and examine the waveforms on an oscilloscope to ensure that the EMG signal has a high SNR. If the signal SNR is poor, move the electrodes until a location with a high SNR is found.\nMake sure that the subject’s movements are not hindered by the EMG cables.\nKinematic measurements\n\t\t\nAttach a reflective marker to the shank with a strap, to be used for shank angle measurement.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Place the shank marker as high as is possible on the shank to generate the largest possible linear displacement for a given rotation, therefore, improving angular resolution.\nHave the subject put on the body harness.\nAttach a reflect marker to the subject’s waist with a strap, to be used for upper body angle measurement. Ensure that the waist reflective marker is placed at the mid-point between the left and right PSISs and that the subject’s clothing does not cover the waist reflective surface.\nHave the subject get on the standing apparatus.\nAdjust the subject’s foot position to align the lateral and medial malleoli of each leg to the pedal’s axis of rotation.\nOutline the subject’s foot positions with a marker and instruct them to keep their feet in the same locations during the experiments. This ensures the axes of rotation of ankles and actuators remain aligned throughout the experiments.",
    "Adjust the vertical position of the laser range finders to point to the center of the reflective markers. Adjust the horizontal distance between the laser range finder and reflective markers, so that the range finders work in their mid-range and do not saturate during quiet standing.\nHave the subject lean forward and backward about the ankle and ensure that the lasers remain within their working range.\nMeasure the height of the laser range finders with respect to the ankle axis of rotation.\n\t\t\tNOTE: These heights are used to convert linear displacements to angles.\nExperimental protocols\n\t\t\nInform the subject of what to expect for each trial condition.\nInstruct the subject to stand quietly with hands at the side while looking forward, and to maintain their balance as they do, when faced the real-world perturbations.\nFor perturbed trials, start the perturbation and allow the subject to adapt to it.\nStart data acquisition once the subject has established a stable behavior.\nProvide the subject with sufficient rest period after each trial to avoid fatigue. Communicate with them to see if they need more time.\nPerform the following trials.\n\t\t\t\nFor apparatus test, perform a 2-min test to examine the sensor data 2 h before subject’s arrival. Look for irregularly large noises or offsets in the recorded sensor data. If there are problems, resolve them before the subject arrives.\nFor quiet standing, perform a 2-min quiet standing trial with no perturbations.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: This trial provides a reference, needed to determine if/how postural variables change in response to perturbations.",
    "For perturbed experiments, run the perturbation and acquire data for 2−3 min. Apply pedal perturbations if the objective is to investigate the role of somatosensory system/ankle stiffness in standing. Apply visual perturbations if the objective is to examine the role of vision in postural control. Apply visual and pedal perturbations simultaneously if the objective is to examine the interaction of the two systems in postural control.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: Pedal perturbations are applied as the rotation of the standing device pedals. Similarly, visual perturbations are applied by rotating the virtual visual field, using the VR headset. The angle of the pedal/visual field follows a signal, selected depending on the study objectives. The discussion section provides details regarding the perturbation types, used for the study of postural control and the merits of each perturbation.\nPerform a minimum of 3 trials for each specific perturbation.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Multiple trials is done to ensure reliability of the models when performing the analysis on the collected data; e.g., it is possible to cross validate the models.\nPerform the trials in a random order to ensure the subjects do not learn to react to a specific perturbation; this also makes it possible to check for time-varying behavior.\nCheck the data visually after each trial to ensure that the acquired signals are of high quality.\n2. Identification of human postural control\nNon-parametric identification of the dynamic relation of body angle to visual perturbations\n\t\nExperiment\n\t\t\nAcquire visually perturbed trials for 2 min according to the steps in sections 1.1 and 1.2.\nUse a trapezoidal signal (TrapZ) with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.087 rad and a velocity of 0.105 rad/s.\nHold the pedal position constant at the zero angle.\nAnalysis\n\t\tNOTE: Data analysis in sections 2.1.2 and 2.2.2 is performed using MATLAB.",
    "Decimate the raw body angle and visual perturbation signals (such that the highest observable frequency is 10 Hz), using the following commands:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60078/60078eq1.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60078/60078eq2.jpg\n\t\t\twhere\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60078/60078eq3.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60078/60078eq4.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60078/60078eq5.jpg\n\t\t\tNOTE: For a sampling rate of 1 kHz, the decimation ratio must be 50 to have a highest frequency of 10 Hz.\nChoose the lowest frequency of interest, which will determine the window length for power estimation.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Here, a minimum frequency of 0.1 Hz is chosen, so the window length for power estimation is 1/0.1 Hz = 10 s. The frequency resolution is the same as the minimum frequency, and therefore, the calculations are done for 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, …, 10 Hz.\nChoose the type of window and degree of overlap to find the power spectra.\n\t\t\tNOTE: For a trial length of 120 s, 10 s Hanning windows with 50% overlap results in averaging of 23 segments for power spectrum estimation. Since we decimated the data to 20 Hz, a 10 s window has a length of 200 samples.\nUse the imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60078/60078eq6.jpg function to find the frequency response (FR) of the system:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60078/60078eq7.jpg\n\t\t\twhere\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60078/60078eq8.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60078/60078eq9.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60078/60078eq10.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60078/60078eq11.jpg\n\t\t\tNOTE: The presented imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60078/60078eq6.jpg function computes the cross-spectrum between the decimated VR perturbation and body angle in the frequencies specified by imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60078/60078eq12.jpg, using a Hanning window with the length specified by imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60078/60078eq13.jpg and the number of overlaps equal to imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60078/60078eq14.jpg (i.e., 50% overlap). Similarly, it computes the auto-spectrum of the VR input. Then, using the estimated cross-spectrum and auto-spectrum, it computes the FR of the system.\nFind the gain and phase of the estimated FR in step 2.1.2.4, using the following commands:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60078/60078eq15.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60078/60078eq16.jpg\n\t\t\twhere\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60078/60078eq17.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60078/60078eq18.jpg\nCalculate the coherence function using the following command:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60078/60078eq19.jpg\n\t\t\twhere\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60078/60078eq20.jpg",

The identification can also be done using subspace method (which inherently deals with MIMO systems)27 or using parametric transfer function methods such as MIMO Box-Jenkins28. Both subspace and Box-Jenkins (and other methods) are implemented in MATLAB system identification toolbox.\nParametric identification of ankle intrinsic stiffness in standing\n\t\nExperiment\n\t\t\nPerform mechanically perturbed trials for 2 min.

    "NOTE: “filtfilt” function does not cause any shift in the filtered signal. Do not use the “filter” function, because it generates a shift.\nPlot the foot velocity, and visually find an estimate of the time period between the extrema of the foot velocity and the start of the pulse (which is the first point with zero foot velocity before the peak velocity). For the perturbation in this study, this point occurred 25 ms before the velocity extrema found in step 2.2.2.2.\nFor each pulse, compute the ankle background torque as the mean of the ankle torque of 25 ms prior to the start of the pulse, i.e., the mean of the torque in the segment starting 50 ms until 25 ms before the velocity extrema.
