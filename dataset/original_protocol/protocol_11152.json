    "The following are a series of step-by-step protocols used for both establishing PDX models by subcutaneous flank implantation and for setting up preclinical studies that enable testing of treatments, which can aid in assessing biological changes and various steps of the metastatic cascade. All the studies and models used 3-8 weeks old female NOG mice. All the tissue samples were collected under informed consent in accordance with a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). All animal experiments were performed in accordance with an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved protocol.\n1. Establishment and propagation of PDX models by flank implantation\nEstablishment of PDX models\n\t\nFollowing surgical resection of the tumor from the patient in the operating room, store the fresh tumor tissues in a suitable solution (such as DMEM) and immediately place it on ice. Use an excess of storage solution (>10 mL) to ensure that the tissue is fully submerged.\nTransfer tissue to tissue culture dish and rinse with 5 mL DPBS.\n\t\tNOTE: This step should be conducted in a biosafety cabinet using aseptic techniques. Precautions should be taken by wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect against possible human infectious agents.\nRemove necrotic regions from the tumor.\n\t\tNOTE: This can be recognized as a white mushy region toward the center of the tissue.\nCut the remaining tissue into approximately 2 x 2 x 2 mm pieces.\nTransfer the tissues into a microcentrifuge tube containing the growth factor reduced basement membrane matrix and store them on ice. Ensure that sufficient basement membrane matrix (>200 µL) is used to fully submerge each tissue piece.\nCryopreserve the remaining tissues that will not be implanted according to protocol described in the step 1.3.",
    "Anesthetize the animal in an induction chamber with 2-5% isoflurane and oxygen. Once anesthetized, transfer the animal to a nose cone to maintain anesthesia at 1.5-2.5% isoflurane with a continuous oxygen supply. Confirm the anesthesia depth via lack of pedal reflex. Apply the veterinary ophthalmic ointment to prevent eye dryness during surgery. Provide thermal support for the animal throughout the procedure until the animal recovers. \nIdentify the implantation site on the mouse.\n\t\tNOTE: This should be on the right or left flank of the mouse, generally landmarked laterally on the side of the abdominal region, caudal to the ribcage.\nTo prepare the surgical area, shave the fur and disinfect with three alternating scrubs of povidone iodine and 70% ethanol.\nUsing forceps, lift the skin of the mouse and make a 0.5-1 cm incision on the skin.\nInsert a pair of surgical scissors slowly under the skin at the incision site to create a pocket (0.5-1 cm deep) in the subcutaneous space.\nCarefully place one tumor piece in the pocket and push it push it to the bottom of the pocket to prevent the tumor from slipping out.\nClose the incision using 4-0 nylon surgical sutures.\n\t\tNOTE: Other wound closure methods such as non-absorbable or absorbable sutures and wound clips can also be used.\nTransfer the mouse back to the cage and monitor the animal's recovery from anesthesia, until it is ambulatory.\n\t\tNOTE: Analgesics are not required but can be administered if pain is observed in the mice.\nMonitor the tumor growth weekly. One tumor is expected per mouse.",
    "NOTE: The tumor's volume at transplantation will seem to initially decrease but this is not a cause for concern. A tumor is considered to have taken once it becomes palpable and enters a logarithmic growth phase. This first passage represents the F0 generation.\nOnce the tumors start growing, measure the tumors three times per week. Measure the length and width of the tumors with a caliper. To calculate the volume of the tumor, use the formula: length x width x width / 2.\nEuthanize the mice implanted with PDX tumors when the tumors are greater than 15 mm in diameter using the longest side of the tumor. Perform the euthanasia by CO2 inhalation in a CO2 induction chamber, followed by cervical dislocation as a secondary method.\nResect the tumor from the flank of the animal by making an incision. Dissect the excised tumor gently with blunt scissors and forceps. To do this, first cut off the skin on top of the tumor, then cut the tumor away from the muscle layer below it.\nTransfer the tumor tissue to >10 mL of a suitable storage solution (such as DMEM). Immediately place it on ice. This tumor can be cryopreserved or passaged to another set of mice. Consider this passage as F1.\n\t\tNOTE: Passaging again would render the tumor passage F2 and so on.\nPropagation of PDX models\n\t\nBegin with the resected tumor kept in storage solution from step 1.1.19.\nTransfer the tissue to a tissue culture dish and rinse with 5 mL DPBS.\nRemove the necrotic regions from the tumor.\nCut the tissue into approximately 2 x 2 x 2 mm pieces.\nTransfer the tissues into a microcentrifuge tube containing growth factor reduced basement membrane matrix (>200 µL) and store on ice.",
    "Cryopreserve the remaining tissue that is not used for propagation according to the protocol described in step 1.3.\nAnesthetize the animal in an induction chamber with 2-5% isoflurane and oxygen. Once anesthetized, transfer the animal to a nose cone to maintain anesthesia at 1.5-2.5% isoflurane with a continuous oxygen supply.

One tumor is expected per mouse.\n\t\tNOTE: The tumor's volume at transplantation will seem to initially decrease but this is not a cause for concern. A tumor is considered to be taken once it becomes palpable and starts to continually grow.",
    "Once the tumors start growing, measure the tumors three times per week. Measure the length and width of the tumors with a caliper. Calculate the volume of the tumor using the formula: length x width x width / 2.\nEuthanize the mice implanted with PDX tumors when the tumors are greater than 15 mm in diameter using the longest side of the tumor.

Inoculation routes for preclinical studies\nSubcutaneous flank implantation.",
    "NOTE: Subcutaneous flank implantation can be used for ease and can be helpful for studying all steps of the metastatic cascade.\n\t\nUse growing PDX tumors or cryopreserved PDX tumors for initial flank implantation.\nFor growing PDX tumors, euthanize the mice using an IACUC-approved method when the tumors are greater than 15 mm in length; resect the tumor and transfer the tumor tissue to a suitable storage solution (such as DMEM) and immediately place on ice.\nFor cryopreserved PDX tumors, thaw the cryopreserved PDX tissue quickly by immersing in 37 °C water bath.\nFollow the steps 1.2.2-1.2.19.\nOrthotopic implantation by intracranial injection into the brain.\n\tNOTE: This model can be used for testing efficacy of drugs to cross the BBB and to study tumor colonization. This section primarily references the use of the tumor dissociation kit (see Table of Materials). Different tissue types require different dissociation protocols. It is recommended that the user test and optimize the protocol to maximize the dissociation efficiency.\n\t\nEuthanize the mice implanted with PDX tumors using an  IACUC-approved method when the tumors are greater than 15 mm in length.\nUnder sterile conditions in a biosafety cabinet, surgically resect the PDX tumors and store in DMEM on ice.\nPrepare the dissociation solution in the appropriate tube by adding the enzyme mix into DMEM as indicated by the manufacturer's protocol.\nWash the tumor in 5 mL DPBS in a tissue culture dish.\nRemove the necrotic regions from the tumor.\nCut the tumor into small pieces of 2-4 mm in length.\nTransfer the tumor pieces into the tube containing the enzyme mix.\nAttach the tube to the tissue dissociator and run the program suitable for the tissue type. Consult the manufacturer's protocol for the appropriate program to run, and the dissociation time required.",
    "After completion of the program, strain the cells through a 70 µm cell strainer.\nWash the cell strainer with 20 mL of DMEM.\nCentrifuge the dissociated cells at 300 x g for 7 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in DPBS.\nCount the cells and dilute to the required concentration.\nSet up the stereotaxic frame according to the manufacturer's instructions and prepare a heating pad for the mice. Sanitize all areas with 70% ethanol.\nAnesthetize the animal in an induction chamber with 2-5% isoflurane and oxygen. Once anesthetized, transfer the animal to a nose cone to maintain anesthesia at 1.5-2.5% isoflurane with a continuous oxygen supply. Confirm the anesthesia depth via lack of pedal reflex. Apply the veterinary ophthalmic ointment to prevent eye dryness during surgery. Provide thermal support for the animal throughout the procedure until the animal recovers.\nPrepare the surgical area by shaving the fur on the mouse's head to expose the scalp.\nProvide the mouse with the appropriate analgesic, such as one dose of 1 mg/kg Buprenorphine sustained release (SR) administered by subcutaneous injection.\nTransfer the mouse to the stereotaxic frame. Ensure that the mouse is biting on the bite-block. Use the ear bars to firmly secure the head of the mouse.\n\t\tNOTE: The mouse is properly secured if the head does not move when pushed gently with forceps.\nDisinfect the shaved area with three alternating scrubs of povidone-iodine and 70% ethanol.\nMake a 5-7 mm longitudinal incision on the scalp to expose the skull and retract the scalp.\nScrape off the periosteum with a blunt surgical instrument such as forceps.\nLocate the bregma on the skull.\nPosition the needle of the stereotactic frame on top of the bregma and reset the coordinates to 0 or note the coordinate on the arm.",
    "Move the arm 1 mm posterior (caudally) and 1 mm lateral, right of the midline.\nMark this location with a permanent marker. If the arm contains a slot for the syringe, attach a marker to the syringe slot to mark the location.\nDrill a small burr hole in the skull at this location. Do not apply too much pressure to prevent drilling into the brain.\nLoad a 5 µL, 26 G Hamilton syringe with 5-10 x 104 cells, in a volume of 1-2 µL, and attach to the stereotaxic arm.\nSlowly insert the Hamilton syringe needle 2 mm into brain.\nBegin injecting cells at the desired rate, usually 0.2-0.5 µL/min.\nAfter the injection is complete, slowly retract the needle from the brain.\nFill the burr hole with bone wax.\nClose the incision with surgical sutures or surgical glue.\nTransfer the mouse back to the cage and monitor its recovery from anesthesia.\nMonitor the condition of the animals regularly and euthanize them when the humane endpoint criteria are reached in the approved protocol.\n\t\tNOTE: Successful tumor growth in the brain results in deteriorating condition of the animal, which often manifests with head tilt, rough hair coat, hunched body, squinted eyes, reduced activity, and low body condition score (BCS < 2).\nPerform a necropsy on the euthanized animals, followed by histological analysis to confirm the presence of tumors in the brain. Record the length of time it takes from implantation to euthanasia.\nImplantation of PDX models by intracardiac injection\n\tNOTE: This model can be used to study organ tropism once tumor cells are in circulation. This section also uses the Tumor Dissociation Kit and requires optimization by tissue type.\n\t\nFollow the steps 2.2.1-2.2.13.",

Confirm the anesthesia depth via lack of pedal reflex. Apply the veterinary ophthalmic ointment to prevent eye dryness during surgery. Provide thermal support for the animal throughout the procedure until the animal recovers.\nThen, position the mouse in a supine position.\nTo prepare the surgical area on the chest, shave the fur and disinfect it with three alternating scrubs of povidone-iodine and 70% ethanol.\nDraw 0.5-10 x 105 cells into a syringe on a 28 G needle, up to a volume of 100 µL.\n\t\tNOTE: The number of cells required varies depending on the aggressiveness of the model and the optimal number of cells should be empirically determined for each model.\nLocate the injection site (slightly left of the mouse's sternum and halfway between the sternal notch and xyphoid process).\nInsert the needle vertically into the mouse at the injection site.\nObserve the successful entry into the left ventricle through a backflow of blood entering the syringe. Slowly dispense the cells into the left ventricle without moving the needle.\nSlowly pull the needle out vertically from the mouse.\nApply a piece of sterile gauze over the injection site and apply pressure for around 1 min until the bleeding stops, while still allowing chest movement for respiration.\nRemove the mouse from anesthesia and allow it to recover on a heated pad.\n\t\tNOTE: Successful tumor growth results in deteriorating condition of the animal, which often manifests with ruffled hair coat, hunched body, squinted eyes, reduced activity, and low body condition score (BCS < 2).",
    "Monitor the condition of the animals regularly and euthanize them when the humane endpoint criteria are reached in the approved protocol.\nPerform a necropsy to identify metastases on the euthanized animals, followed by histological analysis to confirm the presence of tumors in the target organ. Record the length of time it takes from intracardiac injection to euthanasia."
