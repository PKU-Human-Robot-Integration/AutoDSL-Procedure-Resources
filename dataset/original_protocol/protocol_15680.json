    "All procedures were approved by the George Washington University biosafety and ethics committee. The compositions of media and buffers used in this protocol are provided in Table 1. The commercial product information used here is provided in the Table of Materials.\n1. Human iPSC-derived neuron culture\nHuman iPSC culture and LAMP1-APEX probe integration (7 days)\n\t\nThaw Matrigel stock solution in an ice bucket at 4 °C overnight, aliquot 500 µL of the solution into cold sterile tubes, and store the aliquots at −80°C. Prepare 50 mL of coating solution by adding 500 µL of the Matrigel stock into 49.5 mL of cold DMEM/F12 medium.\n\t\tNOTE: Keep the Matrigel cold and use prechilled conical tubes and pipette tips to prevent polymerization.Coating solution can be stored at 4 °C for 2 weeks.\nCoat a 10 cm cell culture dish with 4 mL of coating solution for 1 h in a 37 °C incubator.\n\t\tNOTE: Vitronectin can be an alternative coating solution at 5 µg/mL concentration and 2 h coating for iPSC culture. Vitronectin (single protein component) is more expensive than Matrigel but has less batch variations and cleaner background signals than Matrigel, which is extracted from mouse tumor with numerous extracellular matrix proteins. Non-treated tissue culture plate is needed for vitronectin coating. Matrigel coating works for both treated and non-treated tissue culture plates.\nThaw and plate 1-3 million hiPSCs on each coated 10 cm dish preloaded with 8 mL of Essential E8 complete medium supplemented with ROCK inhibitor (final concentration 10 µM Y-27632 or 50 nM Chroman1).\n\t\tNOTE: Adding ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632 or Chroman1) to the stem cell culture medium minimizes dissociation-induced apoptosis after splitting and cryogenic preservation. Chroman1 has recently been shown to be more potent than Y-27632 at inhibiting both ROCK1 and ROCK224.",
    "Change to 10 mL of E8 complete medium without ROCK inhibitor after the iPSCs form colonies, typically after 1-2 days. Maintain the iPSC culture in E8 complete medium and replace the supernatant with fresh medium every other day.\nIntegrate the proximity labeling enzyme, engineered ascorbate peroxidase (APEX2), into the C-terminus of endogenous LAMP1 gene by CRISPR genome engineering. For detailed steps to generate an engineered stable cell line, refer to the previously published method (Frankenfield et al).22.\nHuman iPSC-neuron differentiation (3 days)\n\t\nCoat a 10 cm cell culture dish overnight with 4 mL of Matrigel coating solution in a 37 °C incubator before differentiation.\nMaintain hiPSCs until ~70% confluence. Gently wash the hiPSCs with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 2x to remove dead cells. Aspirate the PBS and add3 mL of Accutase to the 10 cm dish of cells. Shake the plate for even distribution and incubate for 8 min in a 37 °C incubator.\nAdd 2 mL of PBS to wash and lift the cells from the plate and collect all cell solution in a 15 mL conical tube. Pellet the cells by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min. Plate 2-4 × 106 hiPSCs onto a Matrigel-coated plate preloaded with 8 mL of warm neuron induction medium (Table 1). Evenly distribute the cells and place in a 37 °C incubator.\n\t\tNOTE: Neuron differentiation is driven by a doxycycline-inducible transcription factor, neurogenin-2 (NGN2), which was overexpressed in this stable hiPSC cell line15.\nWash hiPSCs gently with PBS on day 1 of differentiation to remove dead cell debris. Replace with 10 mL of warm induction medium without ROCK inhibitor.\nChange with warm induction medium without ROCK inhibitor every day until day 3 of differentiation.\n\t\tNOTE: Neurons are ready to be replated into neuronal medium.",
    "Plating neurons and maintaining neuron culture (10 days)\n\t\nPrepare 0.1 mg/mL Poly-L-Ornithine(PLO) coating solution in Borate buffer (Table 1).\nCoat a cell culture dish with the PLO coating solution in a 37 °C incubator for at least 1 h or overnight prior to plating day 3 neurons. Wash the dish with 4 mL of sterile water three times and let it air dry completely inside the biosafety cabinet.\nDissociate day 3 neurons from each 10 cm dish with 3 mL of Accutase and plate 8-10 million cells onto each 10 cm PLO-coated dish preloaded with warm cortical neuron medium (Table 1).\nPerform a half-medium change every 2-3 days with warm neuron medium until the i3Neurons reach maturation in 2 weeks after differentiation.\n2. In situ proximity labeling and neuron lysis (2 h)\nPrepare 500 mM biotin-phenol (BP) stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and store at −20 °C. On the day of proximity labeling, dilute the BP stock solution with warm neuron medium and treat the neurons at a final concentration of 500 µM for 30 min in a 37 °C incubator.\n\tNOTE: Doxycycline is added in the neuron medium, which will activate APEX enzyme expression. Doxcycline needs to be added at least 24 h before the proximity labeling experiment.\nInitiate the labeling reaction by adding H2O2 at a final concentration of 1 mM into the neuron culture and incubate for exactly 1 min. Immediately aspirate the medium and rinse 3 times with quench buffer (Table 1).\n\tNOTE: H2O2 solution should be made fresh before the labeling reaction. The H2O2 activation needs to be exactly 1 min to reduce experimental variation and minimize oxidative stress caused by prolonged H2O2 treatment.",
    "Tilt the plate to aspirate all the residual buffer. Add ice-cold cell lysis buffer (Table 1) directly onto the neuron plate. Use 100 µL of cell lysis buffer per 1 million neurons. Swirl the plate for sufficient cell lysis and place on ice.\nScrape the cell lysates into cold 1.5 mL tubes. Sonicate in an ice-cold water bath using a bath sonicator (>100 W) for 15 min with alternating 40 s on, 20 s off cycles.\n\tNOTE: Sufficiently lysed protein solution should be clear without pellets or excessive bubbles. Sufficient sonication of cell lysate is crucial to shear nucleic acids and reduce the stickiness of the cell lysate to reduce nonspecific binding in downstream procedures. A probe sonicator can also be used to provide stronger and faster cell lysis, but washing the probe between samples is required to minimize cross-contamination and sample loss.\nAdd cold acetone (−20 °C) to the sample at a 4-fold volume of lysis buffer. Vortex briefly and incubate at −20 °C for 3 h.\nCentrifuge at 16,500 × g for 10 min at 2 °C. Remove the supernatant without disturbing the protein pellet. Wash the pellet with 1 mL of −20 °C acetone 2x and remove the supernatant after centrifugation.\nDry the protein pellet with a vacuum concentrator for 1 min. Add cell lysis buffer to completely dissolve the pellet. Sonicate briefly if needed. Store the samples at −80 °C.\n\t​NOTE: Acetone precipitation can remove residue biotin-phenol in the sample, which can interfere with downstream enrichment of biotinylated proteins.\n3. Fluorescence microscopy to validate APEX localization and activity (1.5 days)\nIncubate the i3Neurons expressing endogenous LAMP1-APEX with 500 µM BP for 30 min at 37 °C. Activate the labeling with 1 mM H2O2 treatment for just 1 s to limit the diffusion of biotin cloud.",
    "Fix the cells immediately with 4% paraformaldehyde in the quench buffer and gently wash 3x with PBS.\n\tNOTE: For a 10 cm dish, 4-6 mL is needed for a sufficient wash.\nBlock and permeabilize the cells using 3% donkey serum and 0.1% saponin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature (RT).\nIncubate the cells with primary anti-LAMP1 antibody (mouse monoclonal H3A4, 1:1,000) overnight at 4 °C.\nWash the neurons 3 x gently with PBS. Incubate the neurons with anti-mouse AF561 secondary antibody (1:1,000) and Streptavidin-680 (1:1,000) for 1 h at RT.\nWash 2x with PBS and incubate with Hoechst or 4',4-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) nuclear marker for 10 min at RT. Rinse the cells 2x with PBS.\nVisualize the fixed neurons under a fluorescence microscope. Observe biotinylated proteins stained with streptavidin and colocalized with LAMP1 staining outside the nucleus to validate the correct location of APEX activity.\n4. Determining the streptavidin beads-to-input protein ratio (1.5 days)\nPerform detergent-compatible protein assay (DCA) to determine total protein concentrations in cell lysates\n\t\nDissolve bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein standard in the cell lysis buffer at a concentration of 4 mg/mL. Prepare a series of BSA protein standard solutions (0.2-2 mg/mL, 5 dilutions) using the cell lysis buffer.\nTransfer 5 µL from each protein sample, BSA protein standard solution, and blank cell lysis buffer in triplicate into each well in a 96-well plate.\nAdd 2 µL of reagent S per 1 mL of reagent A to get reagent A'. Add 25 µL of reagent A' to each well. Add 200 µL of reagent B to each well. Mix and pop bubbles if present.\nIncubate that 96-well plate at RT for 15 min, read the absorbance at 750 nm in a microplate reader, and quantify the concentrations of protein samples based on the BSA standard curve.",
    "Beads titration dot blot assay (1.5 days)\n\t\nTransfer a series of streptavidin magnetic beads slurry (20 µL, 15 µL, 12 µL, 10 µL, 8 µL, 4 µL, 1 µL, 0 µL) to PCR strip tubes. Put the PCR strip tubes on a magnetic rack, wash the beads 3x with 100 µL of 2% SDS buffer, and remove the wash buffer completely while on the magnetic rack.\nAdd 50 µg of protein sample to each tube. Add more lysis buffer to a total volume of 80 µL. Close each tube tightly and rotate at 4 °C overnight.\nCentrifuge the PCR strip tubes briefly on a benchtop microcentrifuge. Place the PCR strip tubes on a magnetic rack for 1 min. Spot 2 µL of supernatant from each tube onto a dry nitrocellulose membrane and allow the membrane to dry completely.\n\t\tNOTE: If the signal intensity is low, more than 2 µL can be spotted onto the membrane. The volume can be increased by spotting several times on the same spot after the membrane is air-dried between each time. A Bio-Dot Apparatus can also be used.\nIncubate the membrane in blocking buffer (TBS) for 1 h. Incubate the membrane in Streptavidin Alexa Fluor 680 conjugate (1:1,000 in blocking buffer) for 1 h. Then, wash the membrane with TBS-T (Table 1) 5x.\n\t\tNOTE: An alternative to the dot blot assay is western blotting using a streptavidin antibody.\nMeasure the fluorescent signal of each dot on the membrane under 680 nm wavelength, and generate a scatter plot with fluorescent signal over the volume of beads. Select the optimal volume of beads needed for 50 µg of input protein sample based on where the exponential decay of the curve ends .",
    "​NOTE: Fluorescence intensity represents the abundance of biotinylated proteins in the supernatant, which should decrease with increasing amounts of beads.\n5. Enriching biotinylated proteins and on-beads digestion (3 days)\nTransfer protein lysate samples from −80 °C and sonicate the samples in 1.5 mL tubes for 30 s in a bath sonicator to quickly thaw the solutions. Vortex and place the sample tubes on ice.\nTransfer 250 µL of streptavidin (SA) magnetic beads slurry to each 1.5 mL tube. Put the tubes on a magnetic rack, wash the beads 3x with 1 mL of Wash Buffer A (2% SDS), and remove the residual buffer.\nBased on the results of the dot blot assay and DC protein assay, calculate the amount of protein sample (µg) needed for 250 µL of the streptavidin magnetic beads slurry.\n\tNOTE: In this endogenously expressed LAMP1-APEX probe, 5 µL of beads are needed for 50 µg of input protein. Therefore, 2.5 mg of total protein is added to 250 µL of beads. Less than 250 µL of SA beads may be used for limited input sample material.\nAdd cell lysis buffer to the tube containing the magnetic bead-lysate mixture to a total volume of 1 mL and rotate at 4 °C overnight.\n\tNOTE: Samples from different groups or replicates should be normalized to the same protein concentration, volume, and amount of beads to reduce experimental variations.\nSpin down all the tubes briefly on a benchtop microcentrifuge and place the tubes on a magnetic rack for 1 min. Remove the supernatant while on the magnetic rack.\n\tNOTE: It is critical to wait for 1 min after placing the sample tubes on the magnetic rack every time. This can minimize bead loss due to the invisible small amount of beads still moving toward the magnet in the solution.",
    "Wash the beads 2x with 1 mL of Wash Buffer A at RT (5 min rotation each time). Repeat the process with each wash buffer 2x sequentially at 4 °C. (Buffer B, Buffer C, and Buffer D; Table 1).\n\tNOTE: A high concentration of SDS solution can precipitate at cold temperatures. The first wash must be performed at RT.\nPut the tubes on the magnetic rack. Wash the beads 2x with Buffer D to completely remove residual detergent. Resuspend the beads in 100 µL of 50 mM Tris buffer and add 5 mM TCEP (final concentration) to incubate for 30 min at 37 °C in a temperature-controlled mixer, shaking at 1,200 rpm.\nAdd 15 mM iodoacetamide (IAA, final concentration) to each tube and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C in a temperature-controlled mixer, shaking at 1,200 rpm in the dark (mixer cap on).\n\tNOTE: IAA is light-sensitive and should be made fresh 5 min before this step.\nAdd 5 mM TCEP (final concentration) to quench excess IAA. Incubate for 10 min at 37 °C in a temperature-controlled mixer with shaking at 1,200 rpm (mixer cap off).\nCentrifuge the sample tubes briefly and place on a magnetic rack for 1 min to remove the supernatant. Add 200 µL of 5 mM TCEP in 50 mM Tris buffer to resuspend the beads. Add 1 µg of Trypsin/Lys-C mix to the sample, and incubate for 14 h at 37 °C in a temperature-controlled mixer, shaking at 1,200 rpm.\nAdd an additional 0.2 µg of Trypsin/Lys-C mix and digest for 3 h.",
    "Spin down the sample tubes briefly and put the tubes on a magnetic rack for 1 min. Transfer the peptide supernatant to clean the tubes while on a magnetic rack. Wash the beads with 50 µL of 50 mM Tris buffer (shaking for 5 min) and combine the peptide supernatants.\nAdd 30 µL of 10% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to the tube containing peptide supernatant to get pH <3.\n6. Peptide desalting and fractionation (2 h)\nWet the reverse-phase solid phase extraction plate (only the wells for use) with 200 µL of HPLC grade methanol (MeOH) 3x on the vacuum manifold. Add 200 µL of 1% TFA in HPLC grade water 3x to equilibrate the plate.\nLoad the peptide samples into the plate, slowly turning on the vacuum for a flow speed lower than 3 droplets/s to minimize sample loss.\nWash the extraction plate 3x with 200 µL of 1% TFA. Wash the extraction plate again with 200 µL of 1% TFA containing 2% MeOH (v/v). Keep the flow speed lower than 3 droplets/s.\nReplace the collection plate with a 96-well collection plate. If no fractionation is needed, elute the peptide samples 3x with 100 µL of 1% TFA containing 80% MeOH and combine in a new sample tube. Dry the peptide samples in a vacuum concentrator with no heat.\n\t​NOTE: If fractionation is desired, peptide samples can be eluted into 4 fractions subsequently using 200 µL of 1% TFA containing 15%, 35%, 50%, and 90% MeOH, respectively, in a different collection plate.\n7. Colorimetric peptide quantification assay (optional) (1 h)\nResuspend peptide samples in 50 µL of LC-MS grade water and take 20 µL aliquots to perform the peptide assay.",
    "NOTE: This step consumes a large amount of peptide sample but can provide an accurate quantification of peptide concentration before LC-MS analysis. This is typically conducted only once per sample type for testing before large-scale sample preparation.\nPrepare serial dilutions of the peptide standard solutions (provided in the colorimetric assay kit) in the LC-MS grade water. Prepare the working reagent by mixing 50% Reagent A, 48% Reagent B, and 2% Reagent C.\nTransfer 20 µL of each peptide standard solution (three replicates) and the unknown peptide sample into a 96-well microplate. Add 180 µL of the working reagent to each well, mix well, and incubate the plate for 30 min at RT.\nRead the absorbance at 480 nm in a microplate reader and quantify the concentrations of peptide samples based on the peptide standard curve.\n8. LC-MS analysis\nResuspend the peptide samples in LC Buffer A (2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid, LC-MS grade). Centrifuge at 16,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to get rid of any possible particulates.\nTransfer the supernatant to LC-MS vials. Analyze the samples using a nanoLC-MS instrument.\n\tNOTE: Detailed LC-MS/MS parameters are instrument-dependent and have been described previously22,25,26.\nGenerate a custom LC-MS exclusion list with a range of retention times for highly abundant contaminant peptide peaks such as streptavidin and trypsin with 5 ppm mass accuracy22 (e.g., common streptavidin peptide peaks are m/z 402.5435 [charge 3], m/z 603.3117 [charge 2], m/z 654.9733 [charge 3], m/z 678.6812 [charge 3], m/z 1017.5182 [charge 2], etc.; common trypsin peptide peaks are m/z 421.7584 [charge 2], m/z 523.2855 [charge 2], and m/z 737.7062 [charge 3]).\n9. Proteomics data analysis",
    "Analyze the LC-MS raw data with proteomics data analysis software such as Proteome Discoverer, MaxQuant27, or MS-Fragger28. Include two FASTA libraries for data analysis: 1) a Swissprot Homo Sapiens reference database; 2) a newly generated universal contaminant FASTA library (https://github.com/HaoGroup-ProtContLib), which was proven to improve proteomics identification and decrease false discoveries29.\nSet up the proteomics data analysis parameters with a 1% false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff for protein and peptide spectral matching (PSM) identifications. Select trypsin digestion with a maximum of three missed cleavages, a fixed modification of cysteine carbamidomethylation, and a variable modification of methionine oxidation and protein N-terminal acetylation. Use peptide MS1 peak intensities for label-free quantification. Normalize the peptide intensities to the endogenously biotinylated carboxylase, propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCCA), to reduce proximity labeling variations, as described previously22.\n\tNOTE: PCCA normalization can be selected in Proteome Discoverer software by including a PCCA protein sequence FASTA file. Alternatively, PCCA normalization can be conducted in the downstream data analysis.\nExport protein-level results from the proteomics software. Remove contaminant proteins prior to statistical analysis29. Remove proteins with only 1 PSM or no quantification result. Conduct protein gene ontology (GO)-term analysis with Enrichr30 and protein network analysis with STRING31.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
