    "The protocol presented here follows the guidelines of our institution's human research ethics committee.\nNote: The operator who is administering treatment should always wear earplugs.\n1. Preparation before the Initial Visit\nHave the patient complete a TMS safety questionnaire14 to ensure he or she is appropriate for treatment.\nReview the patient's medical history to be aware of any relevant information, including notes to file.\nHave a consultation with the patient, where they can ask all questions they may have about the treatment, and sign an Informed Consent document in preparation for the procedure.\nPrepare the materials needed for the patient's personal cap: cap, chin strap, one red and one black measuring tape.\n2. Preparing the Patient upon Arrival\nHave the patient sit in the chair positioned in front of the TMS machine's cart, ensuring the patient is at an appropriate angle for the coil to be positioned comfortably on their head.\nHave the patient remove any eye glasses, hair clips or pins, as well as any earrings.\nGive the patient earplugs, and ensure they are properly and stably positioned.\nPosition the TMS machine's arm at 45° relative to the cart holding the stimulator.\n3. Placement of the Personal Cap\nSlide the cap onto the patient's head, with the front over their forehead just above the eyebrows. The cap's red-stitched midline should be along the midline of the patient's head.\nPull the cap's ear covers down stretching the cap firmly around their head and attach the chin strap from one ear cover to the other.\nPull the cap down snugly onto their head and stretch the back peripheral straps up and across the back of their head, fastening the straps onto the back of the cap.",
    "Attach the black, anterior-posterior, flexible ruler along the midline of the cap, with the cap's red midline positioned directly to the left of the ruler. Position the \"0\" point on the ruler at the patient's nasion, which is the junction of their nasal bone to forehead.\nLocate the patient's inion (the most prominent projection at the lower rear part of the head), and record the location on the black midline ruler.\nCalculate 40% of the distance between the nasion and the inion and place the red, lateral-medial, flexible ruler so that its 25 cm mark lines up with this location on the black midline ruler (the two rulers are now perpendicular).\n4. Finding the Individual's Motor Threshold (MT)\nFor the entire MT procedure, line up the \"0\" point on the lateral ruler of the helmet at the cap's midline.\nPosition the front end of the helmet coil cover at 7 cm on the black midline ruler. Adjust the helmet so entire front edge of the helmet is level and perpendicular to the midline ruler on the cap. Record the location at which the helmet coil cover meets the red, lateral-medial ruler on the left side of the patient's head.\nShift the coil cover on left side of the helmet two cm medially along the red lateral-medial ruler. Ensure the coil cover at the front of the helmet still meets the black midline ruler at 7 cm, and the \"0\" mark on the helmet remains positioned at the cap's midline. This will position the maximal magnetic output of the coil approximately over the upper left motor cortex region associated with contralateral hand control.\nTurn on the stimulator and press \"Single Pulse (MEP)\" then set the \"Stimulator Output\" to 50%. Arm the machine by pressing the green button.",
    "Position the patient with the right hand resting over a pillow on their lap, palm facing up, so that any finger movement is more easily seen.\nLocation of the motor cortex:\n\t\nBegin at the location found in Step 4.3. Stand to the left of the patient. Press down on the helmet with one hand while supporting the patient's neck with the other, and apply a single pulse by depressing the stimulus foot-pedal.\nRate any involuntary finger movement on the patient's right hand from 0-5, with 0 being no movement detected, and 5 being a very vigorous involuntary movement (Table 1).\nWait five seconds, then perform this again at the same location. If there is no motor response after 5 single pulses, increase the stimulator output by increments of 5%.\nRepeat Step 4.6 at several more locations in a grid pattern, first finding the most consistently active location along the midline, and then while staying at that midline location, move one centimeter at a time along the lateral-medial ruler to again find the most consistently active location. Manually document this process using a pen and paper (or digitally on a tablet device) to find the location that has the most consistently robust motor response.\nMinimum motor threshold:\n\t\nUsing the location found in Step 4.7, and the intensity found in Step 4.6, administer up to 6 single pulses and count the number of elicited involuntary finger motor responses.\nAdjust the stimulus intensity up or down by 1-2% until the number of elicited motor responses from the 6 single pulses is no less than 2 and no more than 3. This intensity is the motor threshold (MT) for activating the patient's motor neurons. Document the motor threshold minimum found by this process.\n5. Treatment",
    "Position the coil to deliver the maximal magnetic output over left lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), the targeted treatment region, by moving the front edge of the helmet down 6 cm on the midline ruler, or the level of the patient's eyebrow, whichever is higher (i.e., do not position the front of helmet below the patient's eyebrow).\nAfter positioning the coil at the treatment location, secure the helmet coil cover to the patient's head by pulling down on the pad at the back of the helmet, tightening the knob and adjustment cords, and fastening the helmet's chin strap.\nTurn on the cooling system and wait for the temperature gauge to read below 14 °C before starting treatment.\nPress the \"Single Pulse\" button on the stimulator touchscreen to return to Single Pulse mode.\nSet the \"Stimulator Output\" to the patient's established MT, which was determined in step 4.8. Set the \"%MT\" to 100%, which refers to 100% of the patient's established MT.\nPress \"Repetitive Mode\" on the stimulator touchscreen and enter the following treatment parameters: Frequency of 18 Hz (18 pulses per sec); duration of 2.0 sec; wait time of 20 sec; 55 trains. The number of pulses (36) will auto-populate based on the duration and frequency, and \"power\" will auto-populate based on the values entered for the Stimulator Output and %MT on the previous screen. Press \"Run Session.\"\nArm the machine by pressing the green button.\nDescribe to the patient what they will experience (i.e., 2-sec trains of 36 pulses, separated by 20 sec stimulus-free intervals), and verify that they are ready to begin treatment.",
    "Count down loudly and clearly \"3-2-1,\" using fingers in front of the patient so that they are ready for the first train. Press the yellow start button on the panel to administer the first train at the end of the countdown.\nObserve patient's face and limbs, then after the first pulse ask how it felt. If the patient experiences anything more than mild discomfort or mild facial contractions, then the treatment may be stopped by pressing the red button on the panel, and the location may be adjusted (up to 2 cm in any direction) to eliminate discomfort and contractions.\nBegin the first treatment session by administering at 100% power relative to the patient's MT response value (found in step 4.8). In the second treatment session, titrate the patient up to 110%, and the full 120% in the third treatment session. If any increase in power produces significant discomfort, return to the previous power setting and allow the patient to further acclimate to the sensation at the lower power before attempting to increase power again.\nDuring the treatment session, continue to monitor the patient for any signs of facial contractions, limb movement, or inadvertent repositioning of the helmet.\nOnce the treatment is completed: remove the coil, remove the patient's personal cap, and assist them out of the treatment chair if necessary."
