    "Tissue Processing and Immunolabeling for CLARITYNotes: Common notes to processing tissue from all the species described here: All washing, clearing, and staining procedures include placing a vial or tube containing tissue onto a tube rocker for the entire period listed in the protocol. If using an orbital shaker, rock vigorously. Sample should be fully submerged and freely floating in solution while on a rocker. Anytime a fluorophore is present, cover sample in aluminum foil. Some tissues are more prone to volumetric changes (expansion) following clearing and glycerol incubation steps of the Protocol (Figure 1A). Measure volume of tissue/organ via volumetric displacement, pre- and post-CLARITY, if the dimension variables are of importance in the final analysis. All animal procedures described here are in accordance with international ethical standards. Prior to initiating the experiments, receive an approval from your Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.ZebrafishThe optically clear zebrafish larvae have provided an outstanding vertebrate model for developmental genetics, neuroscience, cancer research, studies of metabolic and infectious diseases (Brothers et al., 2011; Wolman and Granato, 2012; Palha et al., 2013; Fior et al., 2017; Kamel and Ninov, 2017; Migault et al., 2018; Vanwalleghem et al., 2018). As the larvae continue to mature, they develop pigment cells which limit the transparency and interfere with imaging. The use of transgenic animals lacking pigment (White et al., 2008; Antinucci et al., 2016) and the CLARITY technique allows for visualization in the whole adult zebrafish or its individual organs (Cronan et al., 2015; Frétaud et al., 2017; Lindsey et al., 2017; Kaufman et al., 2018).   We use adult zebrafish to study adult neurogenesis. Each day, thousands of neural stem or progenitor cells are undergoing cell division in 16 neurogenic niches of adult zebrafish brain, as well as in the spinal cord and gut.",
    "We found that, in the brain, the cell division cycle follows a circadian pattern (Akle et al., 2017). The majority of newborn cells eventually differentiate into specialized neurons (Zupanc et al., 2005; Grandel et al., 2006; Kaslin et al., 2009; Chapouton et al., 2010). CLARITY has proved to be an optimal strategy for quantification of stem cells, progenitor cells, and mature neurons, in the whole brain (see Video 1).  Zebrafish represents an excellent model to study the kinetics of adult neurogenesis and its changes in normal and pathological aging (Stankiewicz et al., 2019). To follow the kinetics of stem cells, neural progenitors and their progeny, we use a pulse-chase technique, with BrdU pulse followed by EdU chase. The protocol below describes a procedure for triple labeling for the S-phase markers (BrdU and EdU) and M-phase marker (pH3). If labeling EdU-only, follow Day 1 Steps 1 and 7 and conduct a wash in 0.05 TBS (2 x 15 min) the next day. For BrdU only, follow Day 1 Steps 1-6 in and Days 2-9 Steps 3-7.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. The 3D confocal imaging of S-phase marker, EdU, within a cleared adult zebrafish brain. Following a 2 h EdU (green) pulse (Dimensions: 2,000 μm x 3,600 μm x 1,100 μm). Note: Green autofluorescence in the vasculature, especially prominent in the optic tectum and cerebellum. Preparation of zebrafish tissue for CLARITYEuthanize fish with overdose of MS222 (see Recipe 1) or place in ice-cold water until operculum movements cease. This protocol can be used for imaging either whole adult zebrafish without dissection or individual organs and tissue sections. The timing of each procedure described below would increase based on the thickness of the specimen. To process the brain tissue, cut heads behind the gills with a new razor-blade.",
    "Avoid any compression or tearing of the CNS. Fix heads overnight in 4% PFA in 1.5 ml Eppendorfs at 4 °C (see Recipe 2). Dissect out brains under a stereomicroscope using forceps, as per Gupta and Mullins, 2010. Transfer brains into a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube containing 0.1 M PBS with 0.02% sodium azide (see Recipe 3) and store at 4 °C, until used. Change storage solution every 2 weeks. This way, samples can be stored for up to 6 months. CLARITY processing of zebrafish brain (Figure 1A)Remove brains from the buffer (0.1 M PBS with 0.02% sodium azide) and transfer up to 6 brains into a 7 ml scintillation vial containing 5 ml of 0.05 M TBS (see Recipe 4). Wash for 1 h. Replace TBS with CLARITY solution (see Recipe 5), using the same scintillation vial. Incubate brains at 37 °C for 30 min. Keep on a rocker at room temperature for 4-6 days, until the tissue is completely transparent (Figures 1A). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190730/20190730023203_1285.jpgFigure 1.

    "Incubate in 50% formamide/50% 2x SSC (see Recipe 6) for 1h45 min at 37 °C. Wash in 0.05 M TBS (2 x 15 min).Incubate in 2 M HCl (see Recipe 7) at 37 °C for 30 min. Rinse in 0.1 M boric acid (see Recipe 8) for 8 min. Wash in 0.05 M TBS (2 x 15 min).Incubate in EdU Click-iT® reaction cocktail covered in aluminum foil for 30 min at room temperature and then 4 °C overnight (see Recipe 9).Note: For those antibodies that, unlike BrdU, do not require antigen retrieval (Steps 2-5), follow only Day 1 step 1 and immediately proceed to Days 2-9 protocol below.Days 2-9: Antibody immunohistochemistry of whole zebrafish brainWash in 0.05 M TBS (2 x 15 min).Add primary antibody: Anti-BrdU Alexa Fluor 647 (Marker for S-phase proliferation; 1:200). Incubate in the solution for 4 days at 4 °C. The sample should be fully submerged and freely floating in the solution during agitation on a rocker. Keep sample covered in aluminum foil. Wash in 0.05 M TBS (2 x 1 h). Incubate in secondary antibody donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555 (1:750) in 0.05M TBS overnight at room temperature. Wash in 0.05 M TBS at room temperature for 2 days to reduce non-specific staining. For long term storage, keep in 0.05 M TBS at 4 °C and covered in aluminum foil.This basic protocol can be used with several antibodies in parallel. For example, we use Anti-phospho Histone H3 (Ser10) (pH3) (marker for mitosis; 1:500) or HuC/HuD (marker for new neurons; 1:500) antibodies simultaneously with staining for BrdU and EdU. To achieve this, we add pH3 antibody (or HuC/D antibody) at Days 2-9 Step 5.",
    "MammalsWhile studying neurogenesis in mammalian embryo and in neurogenic niches of adult brain, lack of tissue transparency is the major obstacle (Stankiewicz et al., 2019). CLARITY allows for deep tissue fluorescent imaging of numerous cells in whole brain specimens (Chung et al., 2013). Importantly, CLARITY also allows for visualization of dendrite and axonal morphology, including changes in neuronal processes associated with neurological diseases, as well as with normal aging. For example, in Alzheimer’s disease, large scale cell death results in shorter, less branched apical dendrites (Buell and Coleman 1981) and the number of dendritic spines is reduced (el Hachimi and Foncin, 1990; Ferrer and Gullotta, 1990). Similarly, in Parkinson’s disease, striatal neurons have truncated dendrites and a reduced number of dendritic spines (McNeill et al., 1988). In contrast, moderate grades of Huntington’s disease show an increase in both dendritic branching and the number of spines, and in later stages of the disease truncated dendritic arbors and spine loss is observed (Ferrante et al., 1991). In normal aging, e.g., in older rhesus monkeys, dendrites of long-projecting neurons in Brodmann Area 46 become shorter and less complex, and dendrites in prefrontal cortex lose spines and synapses (Coskren et al., 2015). Visualizing such changes in dendrite structure provides insights into the nature of the pathological conditions. However, quantification of dendrite structure from digital tissue images is currently a highly labor-intensive process, requiring extensive manual marking, and is extremely challenging to accomplish in large-scale projects (Helmstaedter et al., 2013). CLARITY-processed tissues allow for optimizing 3D imaging and precise quantification of dendrite structure and morphology. As a result, large regions of interest or even whole brain structures can be analyzed in their entirety, while avoiding issues typical of sectioned brains, e.g., interrupting axonal projections, turn or branches, or double counting of cells.",
    "Here we describe the protocol we followed while studying axonal morphology and connections in rodents (Figures 2 and 3) and microcolumnar structures in the brains of non-human primates (NHPs) (Figures 4 and 5).Rodents Preparation of rodent brain for CLARITYConduct standard transcardiac perfusion, first with chilled 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4), followed by 4% PFA solution at 37 °C. Note: Chilled PBS is used to clear the blood throughout the vascular system. Thereafter, 37 °C PFA is used for vasodilation, allowing for more effective and even fixation of the brain tissue, improving the overall quality of immunohistochemistry (Fix et al., 2000).  Remove brain from the skull and post-fix for 24 h in 4% PFA solution at 4 °C, as per Gage et al., 2012. Transfer brains into 0.1 M PBS with 0.02% sodium azide and store at 4 °C, until used (see Recipe 3). We typically use one hemisphere blocks.Change storage solution every 2 weeks. This way, samples can be stored for up to 6 months.CLARITY processing of rodent tissue (Figure 1B)Remove one brain from the buffer and transfer into a 50 ml Falcon tube with 0.05 M TBS. Keep on a rocker for 5 h at room temperature. Process rat brain as a whole or dissect into smaller cubes, or cut thick sections on Vibratome, 0.5 mm-5 mm. Incubate brain tissue at 37 °C on a rocker in CLARITY solution in a 50 ml Falcon tube for 4-10 days (depending on the thickness of the tissue), until the tissue is transparent (Figures 1B). For adult rat brain, one hemisphere clears in approximately 6 days. Doubling the thickness of tissue typically requires doubling the time of incubation.Immunolabeling of proteins in CLARITY processed rodent tissue (Figures 2 and 3). Note: Antibody quality and rate of penetration into the tissue are variable.",
    "Proteins that are expressed in relatively large quantities require less time for incubation in our experience.Wash tissue in 0.01 M PBS for 24-48 h in order to completely remove CLARITY solution. Transfer tissue into a scintillation vial or fresh falcon tube and add a primary antibody(s) solution: anti-MAP2 (marker for dendrites; 1:500) and anti-NeuN (neuronal marker 1:500) in 0.05 M TBS with 1% Triton X-100 (see Recipe 10). Incubate for 12 h at room temperature and then for 4 days at 4 °C. Rinse the tissue in 0.05 M TBS for 12 h at room temperature, on a rocker. Incubate in secondary antibody(s) solution: e.g., anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500), anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568 (1:500) in 0.05 M TBS with 1% Triton X-100. Keep on a rocker at room temperature overnight, then for 2 days at 4 °C.Wash in 0.05 M TBS at room temperature for 2 days to reduce non-specific staining. For long term storage, keep in 0.05 M TBS at 4 °C covered in aluminum foil for up to a month.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190730/20190730023311_6052.jpgFigure 2.

(Scale bars: 1,000 μm in A, 200 μm in B and C). PRIMATES: Non-human Primates (NHP) and Humans Preparation of primate tissue for CLARITYNHP: Conduct standard transcardiac perfusion with chilled 0.1 M PBS (1 L), followed by warm 4% PFA solution (8 L) at 37 °C. Note: Chilled PBS is used to efficiently clear the blood throughout the vascular system. Thereafter, 37 °C PFA is used to provide vasodilation, allowing for more effective and even fixation of the brain tissue, improving the overall quality of subsequent immunohistochemical processing (Fix and Garman, 2000).  NHP: Remove brain from the skull and post-fix the entire brain for 24 h in 4% PFA solution at 4 °C, as per Mortazavi et al., 2018.Human: Brain tissue maintained in 10% formalin solution.Note: The rest of the procedures are common to all primates, NHP and Human.Dissect brain into blocks or sections based on anatomical regions of interest. We typically prepare blocks or sections of one hemisphere, 0.5-1 mm in thickness using a Vibratome. Transfer brain blocks or sections into 50 ml Falcon tubes containing 0.1 M PBS with 0.02% sodium azide and store at 4 °C, until used (see Recipe 3). Change storage solution every 2 weeks.",
    "This way, samples can be stored for up to 6 months.CLARITY Processing of primate brain tissue (Figure 1C)Remove the brain tissue from buffer and transfer into a 50 ml Falcon tube with 0.05 M TBS. Keep on a rocker for 5 h at room temperature. Incubate tissue at 37 °C on a rocker in a 50 ml Falcon tube containing CLARITY solution for 4-15 days (depending on the thickness of the tissue) until the tissue is transparent (Figures 1C). Due to increased lipid content in the brain of non-human primates (NHP) and especially humans (Rouser et al., 1972), when compared to zebrafish or rodent brain, a 0.5 mm section clears in about 4 days and a 1 mm thick section in about 6-8 days. A 5 mm block/section takes around 1 month to clear.Immunolabeling of proteins in CLARITY processed primate tissue (Figures 4 and 5)Note: High lipid content in primate brain tissue and factors such as length of fixation, the type of fixative, the region of interest, and block size affect the rate of tissue clearing. Certain proteins may be masked by long-term fixation in formaldehyde. To increase antigenicity, use sodium citrate buffer Step C2 (see Recipe 11). Antibody quality and rate of penetration into the tissue are variable. Proteins that are expressed in relatively large quantities require less time for incubation in our experience.Wash tissue in 0.01 M PBS for 48 h in order to completely remove CLARITY solution.Formalin fixed brain tissues, especially those that remain in fixative for prolonged periods of time, require antigen retrieval to increase antigenicity. To achieve this, transfer the sample into a scintillation vial or fresh falcon tube and add sodium citrate buffer (see Recipe 11). Incubate for 20-24 h at room temperature, on a rocker. Wash tissue in 0.",

    "Human motor cortex, thick section: image of a 3D stack from cortical layer 3 stained with MAP2 (red); arrows point to the pyramidal neurons (350 μm x 350 μm x 150 μm).Stripping Antibodies and Restaining tissue (common to all species)Antibodies and EdU Click-iT® can be destained (stripped), allowing for multiple labels to be assessed in the same tissue (Murray et al., 2015; Phillips et al., 2016).Place tissue in CLARITY solution for 9-18 days at 37 °C on an orbital shaker or tube rocker. Check whether the stain has been completely eliminated, starting day 10 of incubation, and every 2 days thereafter. To do this, remove one representative sample from the rocker and image under confocal microscope to document the progression of the destaining process. Once complete destaining is achieved, wash tissue in TBS for 4 h at room temperature on an orbital shaker or tube rocker. Repeat the immunohistochemical protocol, as described above.Image Aquisition and Quantification in CLARITY-processed Tissues (common to all species) (Figure 2, Video 1)Note: Cleared tissue becomes somewhat opaque following the immunohistochemistry protocol. To improve the refractive index prior to confocal imaging, incubate tissue in 80% glycerol solution in 0.1 M PBS (Recipe 12), until transparent (Figure 1A). A whole zebrafish brain takes about 10-15 min to clear. For a 0.5 mm brain section, it takes 30-60 min for rodent tissue and 1-2 h for NHP or human tissue to be ready for imaging. The time increases proportionally to section thickness, with a 1 mm thick human brain section taking up to 4 h to clear.  Tissue preparation for imagingInvert a Pelco Black Wall Glass Bottom Dish and roll out Blu Tack in a circle to fully enclose tissue (see Figure 6A).",
    "Add around 500 μl of 80% glycerol solution (see Recipe 12) within the circle and use a brush/forceps to position the tissue in the center of the well. Secure a Pelco Black Wall Glass Bottom Dish on top. Be careful not to flatten brain tissue in order to maintain 3D representation and ensure there are no bubbles. Seal well to prevent tissue dehydration during imaging. To avoid glare during image acquisition, assure a horizontal position of the Pelco dish sandwich using a circular leveler (see Imaging Supplies; Figures 6B and 6C).Place Pelco dish sandwich onto the microscope stage. Add water to the top of Pelco dish for the immersion objective. Acquire z-stack tiles that encompass the entire region of interest.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190730/20190730023630_4745.jpgFigure 6.
