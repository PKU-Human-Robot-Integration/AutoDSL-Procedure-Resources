    "Surgical procedureAnaesthetize mice in an induction chamber by inhalation of 2.5% isoflurane in N2O/O2 (70:30), maintained at 2% by a facemask throughout surgery. Place mouse under a stereomicroscope, remove hair in the right or left hind leg and sterilize the area by the use of a sterile gauze with 70% alcohol.Place the mouse in horizontal position with the femur rotated by 90° with the aid of masking tape placed on the foot (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180114/20180114182547_0720.jpgFigure 4. Mouse placed in horizontal position with the right leg rotated at 90° with the aid of masking tape placed on the footMake an incision in the skin and separate the muscles between the gluteus superficialis and the biceps femoris by cutting the connective tissue (Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180114/20180114182751_3073.jpgFigure 5. Separation of muscles gluteus superficialis and biceps femoris by cutting the connective tissueMove the two muscles to uncover the sciatic nerve.Using curved blunt-tipped forceps and micro-scissors, softly free the sciatic nerve (proximal to the sciatic trifurcation) from the surrounding connective tissue.Under a dissecting microscope, make one ligature, proximal to the nerve trifurcation, while taking care to preserve epineural circulation, around the sciatic nerve with 6-0 silk (Figure 6). The ligature has to be tied loosely around the nerve, until it elicits a brief twitch in the respective hind limb, which prevents over-tightening of the ligation.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180114/20180114183533_0561.jpgFigure 6. Under the dissecting microscope, free the sciatic nerve by curved blunt-tipped forceps and make one ligature with 6-0 silkStitch the muscle layer.Clean the incision and close the skin with 2-3 ligatures of 5-0 dermalon. Apply an iodine solution (Rodine, 10% solution) to disinfect the wound.Return the mouse to its home cage and check routinely for 72 h. Clean all the material used.Mechanical allodynia measurementHandle mice daily in order to reduce stress.",
    "Prior to behavioural testing, mice need to be habituated to the testing procedure and the restricted area. The testing environment should be kept quiet and well controlled, with constant temperature and humidity levels. Testing sessions should be carried out at the same time (9:00-14:00).Reagents preparation (weight the analgesic drug and dissolve in vehicle).Remove the mouse from the house cage and measure its body weight using a balance.Administration of the vehicle or analgesic drug.Administer (i.e., intraperitoneally, i.p.) the analgesic drug to be tested (i.e., raseglurant) or the same volume of vehicle (physiological saline solution) using an insulin syringe. Note: The amount (400-500 μl) of drug to be administered should be adjusted according to the dose to be tested (i.e., 10 mg/kg of raseglurant) and the mouse body weight (20-25 g). For example, for a mouse of 20 g of weight we will administer (i.p.) 400 μl of a 500 mg/L raseglurant solution in saline. In addition, all animal experimentation should be carried out by a researcher blind to drug treatments. Place the mouse in a plastic cylinder placed on a wire mesh table. Habituate for 15 min in cylinders prior to testing to allowing mouse to stay calm and still.After 20 min, assess mechanical pain thresholds by means of von Frey filaments (Figure 3). Thus, apply filament, bending force range from 0.008 to 3.5 g, to the mid-plantar surface of the hind paw (Figure 7).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180114/20180114183826_6415.jpgFigure 7. Quantification of mechanical thresholds by the von Frey filamentsApply each filament, starting from the one with a bending force of 0.008 g, and press it perpendicularly to the plantar surface of the hind paw until it bent for five times over a total period of 30 sec (approximately 2 sec per stimulus) and measure the mouse leg withdrawal after each application (Chaplan et al.",
    ", 1994). Repeat this procedure 5 times with a 3-min interval. Response in 3 out of 5 stimuli is considered as a positive reaction and the filament is assigned as the pain threshold in grams. Lack of response to a filament indicated the next filament with a higher bending force in the following stimulation, whereas a positive response indicated the next filament with a lower bending force.Return the mouse to its home cage. Clean all the material used."
