  "procedures": [
    "This protocol was approved by Institutional guidelines set out by King’s College London, and was performed in accordance with the UK Home Office guidelines and Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986.  Guidelines may vary between institutions; please ensure adherence to institutional guidelines before attempting this procedure.  In order to maintain aseptic technique when touching equipment, autoclave a large piece of aluminium foil and use this to wrap around equipment handles such as on the microscope and anesthesia machine. Sterile cling film (plastic wrap) may also be used.\n1. Preparation\nFamiliarize rats with gel fluid packs (veterinary recovery gel) and soft chow for at least 48 hr prior to stroke surgery. As animals often find difficulty with eating and drinking after the procedure, introduce the animals to these items before surgery, to minimize neophobia. House elderly rats with wooden chew blocks to reduce the incidence of overgrown teeth (See Section 6).\nSterilize all surgical tools before beginning surgical procedures by autoclaving (minimum 121 °C, 15 PSI, for 15 min). Sanitize all working surfaces using 1% chlorhexidine in 70% ethanol and use surgical drapes and maintain aseptic technique for the duration of the procedure.\nInduce lesions on the hemisphere contralateral to the preferred paw. Allocate lesions to either the left or the right hemisphere depending on each rat’s preferred forepaw, determined by the pre-operative baselines in the Montoya staircase test15 (see Figure 4). For simplicity, when describing this procedure in this manuscript, the left paw is the preferred paw, and surgeries are performed on the right hemisphere. Use Lister Hooded or Long Evans rats for these behavioural tests as they learn quickly.",
    "Note: The staircase test is designed to measure changes in both fine and gross skilled movements following motor system damage. The staircase consists of seven steps on each side of a central platform. If equipment for the staircase test is unavailable, the cylinder test is a suitable alternative for testing handedness, but note that there is only a transient deficit on this test in this model of stroke, and therefore will be unsuitable to measure long-term recovery following treatment.\n\t\nPlace three sugar pellets in the well of each step (21 pellets per side). Place rats in the staircase apparatus for 10 min and record the number of pellets retrieved and the number of pellets displaced on each side.\n\t\tNote: To be included in the task post-operatively, rats must retrieve a minimum of 75% pellets at baseline.\n2. Surgery\nUse female elderly Lister-Hooded rats at 16-18 months (250 to 400 g) and induce anesthesia with 5% isoflurane in 1.5 L/min O2. Following induction of anesthesia, reduce the level of isoflurane and maintain it at an adequate but minimized depth for surgery (e.g., 1.5-2%). Deliver anesthesia to the animal by a face mask, and use a scavenging system to limit the surgeon’s exposure to isoflurane.\n\t\nPerform all procedures up to, but not including craniotomy on sham animals, as this procedure can produce behavioral deficits16. Consider experimental goals when designing MCAO experiments, and decide whether or not a sham group to control for craniotomy should be included.\nAdminister pain relief pre- or peri- operatively (Carprieve, 0.25 mg/kg, s. cut).\n\t\nAdd 1 ml to 19 ml sterile 0.9% saline to make the stock solution and inject 0.6 ml per 300 g rat. The use of Carprieve is preferred over Carprofen because the former is stable at RT.",
    "Shave the fur on the ventral neck region and temporal region on the right hemisphere to expose the skin. Disinfect the surgical sites using ethanol swabs. Be sure to follow local IACUC guidelines for hair removal. \n\t\nPerform this step away from the operating area to minimize the amount of fur at the incision site.\nPlace the rat on a corkboard covered with a sterile drape in the supine position on a heating pad. Apply lidocaine cream to the shaved regions of the head and neck. Insert a rectal probe to monitor and maintain the animal’s temperature between 36.5-37.5 °C with a homeothermic system.\n\t\nPut lacrilube ointment on the eyes to prevent drying. Give the rat an injection of atropine sulphate solution (0.05 ml of a 600 µg/ml solution, subcutaneously) to reduce tracheal secretions.\n\t\tNote: Researchers should consider measuring physiological variables such as blood gases and pressure.\nBefore beginning surgery, check the hindpaw pinch withdrawal and blink reflexes to confirm full anesthesia.\nUnder a dissecting microscope, make a 2 cm central midline incision on the exposed neck using a scalpel. Move the salivary glands gently lateral to the trachea on both sides.\nLoop non-absorbable silk suture around the skin that overlies the common carotid artery on one side. Gently pull away the skin from the site using the silk suture and stick these down to the corkboard using surgical tape to reveal the common carotid artery. Carefully blunt dissect the arteries free from surrounding fascia and the vagal nerves using fine forceps.\n\t\nBe careful not to damage the muscle or vagus nerves during this step, as this will impair feeding, swallowing and breathing.",
    "Once the common carotid artery is exposed, use non-absorbable silk suture (5/0) to isolate the carotid, first separating the carotid from the vagus nerve by reverse dissecting with fine forceps and being careful not to make contact with the nerve. Once the vessel has been looped (but not tied) with the suture, tape the ends of the suture together using surgical tape to prevent this step being undone. Remove the sutures holding back the overlying skin.\nRepeat for the other side (Sections 2.7-2.8)\nPlace a sterile saline-soaked gauze into the wound to keep tissues moist during the remainder of the surgery. Loosely suture the skin and place an additional saline-soaked gauze over the area to prevent further dehydration.\nPlace rats in a lateral position and make an incision in the skin at the midpoint between the right orbit and the external auditory canal. Retract the skin using up to five elastic 3 mm hook retractors pinned to the corkboard and then blunt dissect the temporalis muscle to reveal the skull.\nPlace a thumb wheel-adjusted gravity-driven saline drip above the open site (flow rate approximately 2 ml/min) and set up an aspirator system to remove bone debris and to clear minor bleeding from the exposed site throughout this phase of the surgery (Sections 2.13-2.16).\n\t\nPlace the saline delivery nozzle at the highest point of the skull near the ear, and the aspirator nozzle at the lowest point. Adjust the wheel during bleeds to supply more saline to the area to better visualize the source of any bleed for cautery of the vessel, reducing the amount of time the animals are under anesthesia.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53106/53106fig1.jpg",
    "Figure 1. Surgical set up of the permanent distal middle cerebral artery occlusion model. The equipment used in the set up for the rat craniotomy is shown for the right hemisphere, and inset, the positioning of the aspirator and saline drip around the craniectomy site. Also shown are the key features of the vasculature; the middle cerebral artery (red) and inferior cerebral vein (blue) are shown, and the shaded area indicates where coagulation of the artery occurs. Confirmation of the occlusion is performed by cutting the MCA below the inferior cerebral vein. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53106/53106fig1large.jpg]\nPerform a craniotomy on the exposed region (approximately 5 mm x 5 mm) using a dental drill with a coarse 1.6 mm diamond coated drill burr at approximately 8,000 rpm, ensuring the application of circular and lateral pressure and not downward pressure whilst drilling the exposed area. Once the bone is thin enough that it looks completely transparent, remove using forceps.\nUse a homemade dural hook, made by bending one tip of fine forceps approximately 180° to form an arc, to carefully open the dura, being cautious to avoid the large surface blood vessels, as they are delicate and easy to rupture.\n\tNote: The exposed area of the brain will reveal the middle cerebral artery (MCA); the desired segment measures approximately 2 mm in length (see Figure 1, inset).\nCoagulate the MCA from where the inferior cerebral vein crosses, to the point of artery bifurcation and then along the caudal branches of the MCA using a pair of diathermy forceps until fully occluded17. Use angled Jeweler diathermy forceps with 0.25 mm pointed tips.",
    "When occluding the artery, alter the saline flow as necessary to keep this area cool, preventing the coagulating forceps from adhering to the blood vessel. When occluded, the blood vessel appears black and no sign of blood flow should be present; blood flow can be seen in partially occluded vessels.\nCut the MCA at this point to confirm complete occlusion. Using microvascular scissors, cut beneath where the inferior cerebral vein crosses the MCA.\nCover the exposed area with a saline-soaked gauze pad before continuing to the next step.\nTurn the rat back to a supine position and reopen the loosely tied suture on the neck to re-expose the carotid arteries. Ligate the carotid artery on the same side as the occluded MCA (right) permanently by tying a knot in the silk suture around the carotid, whilst the left carotid artery is occluded transiently using a 13 mm stainless steel artery clip with 125 g pressure for 60 min. Loosely suture up the incision in the neck during this time and place a sterile saline soaked gauze on top to prevent dehydration.\nNote that the animal’s right hand side will be on the surgeon’s left hand side, given the supine positioning.\nFor sham animals, open the ventral part of the neck and temporal regions and separate the muscles to locate the common carotid arteries, but do not occlude. Have sham animals undergo procedures up to but not including craniotomy, as this procedure can produce behavioral deficits16. To maintain blinding of other team members (e.g., during later behavioral testing), perform incisions and suturing.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53106/53106fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2. Tandem carotid occlusion following middle cerebral artery occlusion. The right common carotid artery (CCA) is permanently occluded by tying a silk suture (5/0) around the blood vessel (on the left hand side of the image). The left CCA (on the right side) is occluded for 1 hr using a microvascular clamp. These surgeries were performed taking care not to make contact with the vagus nerve on each side (white). Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53106/53106fig2large.jpg]\nSuture the incision in the temporal region during the 1 hr of left common carotid occlusion.\nGive rats 20 ml of saline subcutaneously (5 ml to two sites on each flank) to maintain hydration (see 6.2).\nWhen 60 min has passed, remove the clip. Apply saline topically to the surrounding muscle, and close the incision in the neck using subcutaneous continuous stitching of absorbable sutures (4/0).\n3. Post Operative Care\nPlace the rat in a 31 °C incubator to recover from anesthesia for up to 4 hr.\n\tNote: Researchers may prefer to use other temperatures and durations according to local practice.\nRepeat carprieve (0.25 mg/kg), for pain relief at 24 hr. Because all animals receive the same dose of Carprieve, this factor is controlled for systematically. Any neuroprotective effect of Carprieve is likely to be negligible.\nGive saline injections daily to prevent dehydration for at least the first three days. On the assumption that a rat requires 65 mL fluid per kg body weight (each 24 hr), ensure that each 300 g rat receives ~22 ml fluids per day.\n4. Confirmation of Infarct\nTo measure the infarct volume use structural MRI.",
    "Note: An alternative method could be to use histological staining, such as tetrazolium chloride (TTC), which has been previously correlated to structural MRI data18. However, this can only be used at the end point of the study, and not longitudinally.\n\t\nTwenty-four hours after the induction of MCAO, anesthetize rats with isoflurane (5% for induction, 1-1.5% for maintenance) in 0.9 L/min Medical Air and 1 L/min O2, secure in a quadrature birdcage magnetic resonance coil (43 mm diameter) and place in a 7 Tesla horizontal bore scanner.\nObtain T2 weighted scans using a fast-spin echo sequence: echo time (TE) 60 msec, repetition time (TR) 4,000 msec, field of view (FOV) 40 x 40 mm, acquisition matrix 128 x 128, acquiring 40 x 0.5 mm thick slices in approximately 8 min. Subsequently, convert 40 slices into 20 x 1 mm thick slices by using the resampling function in medical imaging software.\nObtain lesion volumes in a medical image display package by measuring the cross-sectional area of infarct in 20 volumes. Obtain the total volume by multiplying the sum of these areas by the thickness (1 mm). Calculate the group mean volume and standard deviation. For percentage lesion volume calculations, also acquire the volumes of the ipsilesional and contralesional hemispheres.\nTo correct for brain swelling due to edema, adjust these values using Gerriets’ formulae18. Only include slices that contain cortex and do not contain the cerebellum or olfactory bulbs according to a standard rat atlas19 to avoid over-correction, as this can generate negative lesion volumes.\n\t\nAcquire T2 weighted images again 8 weeks after stroke surgery.\n5. Sample Size Calculations for Future Studies Assessing Neuroprotection and Behavioral Recovery",
    "Perform sample size calculations to estimate the minimum sample size that would be required in future hypothetical neuroprotective experiments using two groups (control vs. treatment) to identify treatment effects of three different magnitudes (25% reduction, 50% reduction, 75% reduction) using the a priori algorithms implemented in power analysis software20.\n\tNote: To enable readers to do similar calculations with their own data, there are screenshots from freely-available power analysis software (see Representative Results). Use the following parameters: acceptable false positive rate (i.e., type I error threshold; α) ≤0.05, and power (which equals 1-β) ≥0.80 (i.e., greater than 80% power). See below for explanations and a discussion21.\n6. Elderly Animal Welfare After Stroke Surgery\nMake available additional soft chow and rehydration gel packs that the rats were habituated to before surgery, in addition to water bottles with extended tips for easier reaching. In addition, have an absorbable recovery pad in the cages instead of loose bedding (i.e., avoid wood chip) for the first 24 hr, and provide extra nesting bedding. Do not use pureed food (e.g., baby food) as rats with dysphagia may choke.\nWeigh animals daily for 7 days to monitor recovery. Weight loss is a primary indication of dehydration and stress. Weight loss in the first few days after surgery principally reflects dehydration (rather than loss of body weight due to reduced feeding).\nWhere an ageing rat shows weight loss unrelated to surgery, replace lost body weight with an equivalent weight of fluids and inspect the top and bottom teeth. Where teeth are overgrown, anesthetize the rat with isoflurane (as in section 2.1), and place in a supine position",
    "Place a 1 ml syringe barrel behind the teeth to protect the soft tissues. Cut using a hand-held circular saw (e.g., approximately 3 cm diameter) at high rotary speed but with slow, firm hand movements (e.g., 3 sec cuts). Allow the rat’s teeth to cool down between cuts. Ensure that the rotary saw is mounted on the mandrel so that the saw’s teeth face in the direction of rotation. It is worth keeping individually wrapped, sterilized rotary saws ready for such eventualities.\n\t\tNote: Overgrowth can occur in elderly rats even when maintained on a hard pellet diet. We recommend that teeth are checked in elderly rats regularly.\nWhere an elderly rat shows weight loss and piloerection unrelated to surgery, discuss treatment options with a veterinarian. Consider humanely killing the animal. MRI of such animals can show a pituitary tumor (often in elderly female rats) that is inoperable and fatal."
