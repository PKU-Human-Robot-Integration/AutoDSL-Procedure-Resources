The following procedures are special to lung cancer cell A549. It may be suitable for other cells. The cell culture steps is shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1791-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Illustration of the cell culture steps\nCritical: For other cells, the procedures should adjust.\nResuscitate the cells.\nTransfer the frozen tube containing A549 cells from the liquid nitrogen tank to 37°C warm water, hold the tube with tweezers and gently shake it to make it melt quickly.\nCentrifuge the cells for 3–5 min at 100–400 XG.\nWipe the surface of the freezing tube with 75% ethanol in a laminar hood and then open the tube gently.\nRemove the supernatant with a 1-mL spear tip, add 1 mL of warm (37°C) F12 K culture medium to homogeneously resuspend the cell pellet, and then transfer cells to a 25 cm2 culture flask.\nAdd 4 mL of F12K culture medium (containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin−streptomycin) into the culture flask.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C under an atmosphere containing 5% CO2.\nReplace the culture medium with fresh F12K medium (containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin−streptomycin) after 24 h incubation.\nCulture the cells.\nOptional: Observe the morphology of the cells under an inverted microscope, while the cells bespread the culture flask, trypsinize, and continuous culture cells.\nAfter the cells bespread the culture flask, open the cap of the flask in a laminar hood, and remove the culture medium.\nWash the cells with sterile PBS for 2–3 times to remove the culture medium as much as possible.",
    "Add 1 mL of trypsin solution to the culture flask cells, shake the flask gently to make the trypsin solution flow all over the cell surface.\nPlace the flask under an inverted microscope, and observe the morphology of cells.

Although the following procedures are special for cryptophane based probes, it is suitable for others probes too.",
    "Incubate the cells with probe (Experimental group).\nCulture the cells in 75 cm2 culture flask as described in step 2.\nObserve the bespreading cells (percent confluence>80%) under an inverted microscope, wipe the surface of the freezing tube with 75% ethanol in a laminar hood.\nOpen the cap of the culture flask in a laminar hood, and remove the regular culture medium gently.\nWash the cells with sterile PBS for 2–3 times to remove the regular culture medium.\nAdd 100 μL of cryptophane-based probe (3 mM) and 100 μL of Cremophor ® EL into 9.8 mL of fresh F12K culture medium (without penicillin−streptomycin and FBS), and mixing homogeneously. The final probe concentration is 30 μM in the culture medium.\nAdd the F12K culture medium mixture (contain probe and Cremophor ® EL) into the culture flask.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C under an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 for 2–3 h.\nIncubate the cells with NEM and probe (Control group).\nCulture the cells in 75 cm2 culture flask as step 2 described.\nObserve the bespeading cells under an inverted microscope, wipe the surface of the freezing tube with 75% ethanol in a laminar hood.\nOpen the cap of the culture flask in a laminar hood, and remove the regular culture medium gently.\nWash the cells with sterile PBS for 2–3 times to remove the regular culture medium as much as possible.\nAdd 100 μL of NEM (a popular thiol blocking agent) (0.3 M) and 100 μL of Cremophor ® EL into 9.8 mL of fresh F12K culture medium (without penicillin−streptomycin and FBS), and mix homogeneously. The final NEM concentration is 3 mM in the culture medium. And then add the culture medium into the culture flask.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 2 h.",
    "Open the cap of the culture flask in a laminar hood, and remove the regular culture medium gently.\nWash the cells with sterile PBS for 2–3 times to remove the residual quantities of NEM as much as possible.\nAdd 100 μL of cryptophane-based probe (3 mM) and 100 μL of Cremophor ® EL into 9.8 mL of fresh F12K culture medium (without penicillin−streptomycin and FBS), and mix homogeneously.

    "Remove the supernatant with a 1-mL spear tip smoothly, and add 1 mL of PBS to blow the cells gently. And then centrifuge the cells for 3–5 min at 100–400 XG. Repeat this procedure 2 times to remove the residual probes.\nAll cells are concentrated and transferred into a 5-mL centrifuge tube gently.\nAdd 2 mL of PBS buffer into the tube, and blow the cells smoothly to make a cells suspension.\nCount the cells concentration by cell counter.\nStore the cells suspension in an ice-water mixture for a few minutes.\nCritical: To keep the viability of the cells, all procedures should be performed gently.\nNote: The cell concentration was kept at ∼6 × 106 cells/mL in this experiment. To obtain such concentration of cells, after the cells percent confluence>80%, 3–4 75-cm2 flasks of the cells should be combined.\nProduction of hyperpolarized Xe and initial Xe NMR test\nTiming: 1–1.5 h\nThis main step is to produce the hyperpolarized 129Xe for the initial 129Xe NMR test. Before opening the hyperpolarized 129Xe system, the experimenters should read and understand the standard operating procedures (SOP). The hyperpolarized system is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1791-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Illustration of hyperpolarized 129Xe NMR experiment\nThe 129Xe nuclear spin polarization was enhanced 100,000-fold compared to its thermal equilibrium polarization after the Xe gas mixture was delivered into the hyperpolarizer. After that, the hyperpolarized 129Xe was directly bubbled into the NMR tube, followed by NMR and MRI data acquisition.\nProduce the hyperpolarized 129Xe and acquire the 129Xe NMR signal in PBS.\nStartup the hyperpolarizer. Turn on the hyperpolarizer according to the standard operating procedures.",
    "Turn on the N2 tank (control the pressure valve to bubble or stand by), set the relative gas pressure at 0.5 MPa (5 bar) (i.e., 5 bar above atmospheric pressure). This pressure controls the pressure controller behind the sample, which controls the valve to open or close.\nTurn on the Xe mixture tank, set the relative gas pressure at 51 psig (3.5 bar) (i.e., 3.5 bar above atmospheric pressure). The gas mixture is delivered to the hyperpolarizer to produce the hyperpolarized 129Xe gas.\nAdd 2 mL of PBS into the 10 mm NMR tube, and screw the capillary holder onto the inlet thread.\nConnect the capillary holder of the NMR tube with the gas-delivery tube (coming from the hyperpolarizer) and the other chem thread of the NMR tube with the gas outlet tube (going into the pressure controller).\nSlowly open the outlet valve of the hyperpolarizer.\nSet the gas flow rate into the hyperpolarizer to 0.1 SLPM, to bubble the gas mixture into the NMR tube, and check the status of the gas flow.\nClose the outlet valve of hyperpolarizer to stop the gas flow, while the output pressure decreases to 0 psig, set the gas flow rate at 0 SLPM.\nPut the NMR tube carefully into NMR magnet.\nAdjust the experiment temperature with the VTU of the spectrometer. The NMR data are acquired at room temperature (T = 298 K).\nCreate a new 1H NMR experiment.\nTune and match the 1H resonators, and manually shim the magnetic field.\nAdjust the magnetic field to make the proton chemical shift of the H2O to 4.8 ppm.\nAcquire a 1H NMR spectrum, to evaluate the homogeneity of the magnetic field. If the homogeneity is good, proceed to the next step.\nCreate a new 129Xe NMR experiment.\nTune and match the 129Xe resonators.",
    "Set the number of repetitions to one.\nChoose a bubble time of 60 s, and a waiting time after bubbling of 3 s to allow the bubbles to collapse.\nSlowly open the outlet valve of the hyperpolarizer.\nSet the gas flow rate into the hyperpolarizer to 0.1 SLPM, to bubble the gas mixture into the NMR tube\nAcquire a 129Xe NMR spectrum, to evaluate the status of the hyperpolarizer through the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of 129Xe NMR spectrum. If the status of the hyperpolarizer is good (for our hyperpolarizer, SNR>400), continue to experiment.\nClose the outlet valve of hyperpolarizer to stop the gas flow, while the output pressure decreases to 0 psig, set the gas flow rate to 0 SLPM.\nTake out the NMR tube from the magnet, and unscrew the NMR tube connector carefully while keeping the hyperpolarizer on standby.\nStore the NMR tube for later experiments.\nCritical: The laser system of the hyperpolarizer must be used in strict accordance with the operating procedures to prevent damage. While turning on the hyperpolarizer, all procedures should perform accurately as the description in the SOP. Due to the different hyperpolarizer system having different SOP, the experimenters should read and understand the SOP before turning on the system. Before unscrew the NMR tube connector, the output pressure should decrease to 0 psig, which can avoid the sample suck in gas-delivery tube to pollute the gas-delivery tube.\nHyper-CEST NMR for cells\nTiming: 35–40 min\nThis main step is to acquire the Hyper-CEST for the living cells after incubated with cryptophane-based 129Xe probes. Although the following procedures are specially for cryptophane-based probes, it is suitable for others probes too. The Hyper-CEST pulse sequence is shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1791-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Illustration of the pulse sequence of Hyper-CEST",
    "(A) The hyperpolarized 129Xe was bubbled into the NMR tube for 20 s and waited for another 3 s to allow the bubbles being collapsed. Then a continuous-wave pulse was applied to saturate the Xe in the host cage. After that, a π/2 pulse was applied to acquire the 129Xe NMR spectrum in a single scan.\n(B) For each excitation, the hyperpolarized Xe was bubbled into the NMR tube for 20 s, a wait time (3 s) allowed the bubbles to collapse. After that, a saturation pulse was applied to saturate the on or off-resonance frequency. Then, the image was acquired by a RARE sequence. The n is the echo chain length (rare factor), and N is the excitation number.\nAcquire the Hyper-CEST spectra for living cells.\nLoad 2 mL of cells suspension (the concentration of cells was kept at ∼6 × 106 cells/mL) into the 10 mm NMR tube, and screw the capillary holder onto the inlet thread.\nConnect the capillary holder of the NMR tube with the gas-delivery tube (coming from the hyperpolarizer) and the other chem thread of the NMR tube with the gas outlet tube (going into the pressure controller).\nPut the NMR tube carefully into NMR magnet.\nAdjust the experiment temperature with the VTU of the spectrometer. The NMR data are acquired at room temperature (T = 298 K).\nCreate a new 1H NMR experiment.\nTune and match the 1H resonators, and manually shim the magnetic field.\nAdjust the magnetic field to make the proton chemical shift of the H2O to 4.8 ppm.\nAcquire a 1H NMR spectrum, to evaluate the homogeneity of magnetic field. If the homogeneity is good, proceed to the next step.\nCreate a new 129Xe NMR experiment.\nTune and match the 129Xe resonators.",
    "Set up a series of Hyper-CEST experiments, and set the number of repetitions to one.\nSet the saturation frequency offset range from 55 ppm to 85 ppm with 1 ppm steps (the encapsulated 129Xe NMR signal appeared at ∼ 71 ppm, referenced to the Xe gas, the chemical shift of Xe gas was set as 0 ppm).\nChoose a 6.5 μT continuous-wave (cw) saturation pulse with 10 s for saturation.\nChoose a bubble time of 20 s, and a waiting time after bubbling of 3 s to allow the bubbles to collapse.\nSlowly open the outlet valve of the hyperpolarizer.\nSet the gas flow rate into the hyperpolarizer to 0.1 SLPM, to bubble the gas mixture into the NMR tube.\nAcquire a series of Hyper-CEST experiments.\nAfter all of the Hyper-CEST experiment is completed, close the outlet valve of hyperpolarizer to stop the gas flow, while the output pressure decrease to 0 psig, set the gas flow rate to 0 SLPM.\nRemove the NMR tube from the magnet, and unscrew the NMR tube connector carefully while keeping the hyperpolarizer on standby. Store the NMR tube for later experiments.\nProcess the series of Hyper-CEST experiments data to display the Hyper-CEST spectrum (Z-spectrum).\nAfter the CEST experiment, the integrities of cells was evaluated by an inverted microscope.",
    "Critical: This protocol's saturation frequency offset range is specific for the cryptophane-based 129Xe probes. While using other probes, the saturation frequency offset should be adjusted to a suitable range (the saturation frequency offset range was determined by the position of encapsulated 129Xe NMR signal peak, which should cover the 129Xe NMR signal completely). Before removing the NMR tube from the magnet, the output pressure should decrease to 0 psig. The control group and experimental group both perform the same procedures. To ensure the integrities of cells, the rate of the bubble should be well controlled and the Hyper-CEST experiments should be performed as soon as possible.\nHyper-CEST MRI for cells\nTiming: 30–40 min\nThis main step is to acquire the Hyper-CEST MRI for the living cells after incubated with cryptophane-based Xe probes. Although the following procedures are specific for cryptophane-based probes, it suitable for others probes too.\nAcquire the Hyper-CEST MRI of the living cells.\nLoad 2 mL of cells suspension into the 10 mm NMR tube, and screw the capillary holder onto the inlet thread.\nConnect the capillary holder of the NMR tube with the gas-delivery tube (coming from the hyperpolarizer) and the other chem thread of the NMR tube with the gas outlet tube (going into the pressure controller).\nPut the NMR tube carefully into NMR magnet.\nAdjust the experiment temperature with the VTU of the spectrometer. The MRI data are acquire at room temperature (T = 298 K).\nCreate a new 1H MRI experiment. Tune and match the 1H resonators, perform a global automatic shim on the sample and acquire a proton reference image with automated adjustments for 1H resonance frequency, reference attenuation (flip angle) and receiver gain according to the spectrometer manufacturer’s protocol.\nCreate a new 129Xe NMR experiment. Tune and match the 129Xe resonators.",
    "Set the spectral width to 350 ppm, and set the signal average to four.\nChoose a bubble time of 20 s, and a waiting time after bubbling of 3 s to allow the bubbles to collapse.\nSlowly open the outlet valve of the hyperpolarizer.\nSet the gas flow rate into the hyperpolarizer to 0.1 SLPM, to bubble the gas mixture into the NMR tube.\nAcquire a 129Xe NMR spectrum.\nProcess the 129Xe NMR spectrum with Fourier transform and automatic phase correction. And then, find the resonance frequency of the dissolved Xe peak and use it as the transmitter frequency for further 129Xe MRI acquisition.\nCreate two 129Xe MRI experiments to acquire the on-resonant saturation and off-resonant saturation data.\nChoose RARE sequence to obtain the MRI data. Set the parameters as fellow: set the transmitter frequency; the off-resonant saturation frequency offset set to 119 ppm (according to the z-spectrum interpretation, and the chemical shift of dissolved 129Xe was set as 0 ppm), and the on-resonant saturation frequency offset set to -119 ppm (according to the z-spectrum interpretation, and the chemical shift of dissolved 129Xe was set as 0 ppm); the number of acquisitions set to 16; the saturation power B1 set to 13 μT and saturation time set to 5 s; the rest general parameters set as follow: number of dummy scan =4, slice thickness=25 mm, matrix size=32 × 32, in-plane resolution= 0.9375 × 0.9375 mm2, field of view =30 × 30 mm2, centric k-space encoding, bandwidth=5400 Hz, echo time=4.65 ms, repetition time=28077 ms (including saturation time and xenon delivery), centric k-space encoding, no partial Fourier transform acceleration, rare factor=16.\nSet the gas mixture delivery flow into the hyperpolarizer to 0.1 SLPM.\nOpen the outlet valve of the hyperpolarizer slowly to bubble the gas mixture into the NMR tube.",
    "Run the sequence to acquire the Xe MRI data.\nAfter all of the Xe MRI experiments were completed, close the outlet valve of hyperpolarizer to stop the gas flow, while the output pressure decrease to 0 psig, set the gas flow rate to 0 SLPM.\nTake out the NMR tube from the magnet, and unscrew the NMR tube connector carefully while keeping the hyperpolarizer on standby.\nProcess the Xe MRI data on MATLAB to display the Hyper-CEST response. The image matrix 32 × 32 was interpolated into a 64 × 64 image matrix. Hyper-CEST effect for on-resonant saturation was analyzed compared to off-resonant saturation for each pixel by the formula (CEST effect = (Intensityoff-Intensityon)/Intensityoff) point by point. The mask was used in post-processing, covering the image areas that do not belong to the sample phantom and the normalized signal intensities less than 0.2.\nCritical: The saturation power of B1 field should not exceed the limits of the NMR coil to avoid damaging the coil permanently. Before removing the NMR tube from the magnet, the output pressure should decrease to 0 psig. The control group and experimental group perform the same procedures.\nShut down the system\nTiming: 10–15 min\nThis main step is to shut down the hyperpolarized system. Before closing the system, the experimenter should read and understand the SOP.\nShut down the system according to the SOP.\nEnsure the outlet valve of hyperpolarizer is closed.\nShut down the hyperpolarizer according to the SOP.\nTurn off the N2 tank.\nTurn off the Xe mixture tank.\nTurn off the VTU of the spectrometer.\nCritical: To avoid permanently damaging hyperpolarized system while shutting down the hyperpolarizer, all procedures should perform accurately as the description of the SOP."
