    "This study was performed in compliance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of New York University School of Medicine.\n1. Dissect rat larynx\nEuthanize rat according to the institutionally approved protocol. Shave the ventral neck from the mandible to manubrium and swab with alcohol to prevent fur contamination in the tissue specimens.\nUnder a dissecting scope with 10x magnification excise the entire larynx by creating a midline neck incision with a scalpel until the trachea is exposed.\nSeparate the ventral extrinsic laryngeal muscles at the midline to expose the larynx using forceps and dissecting scissors or a scalpel.\nSever the trachea caudal to the third tracheal ring and make an incision rostral to the hyoid bone to excise the whole larynx using dissecting scissors.\nRemove the extrinsic laryngeal tissues (esophagus, thyroid gland, and extrinsic laryngeal muscles) from the larynx using microdissection tools (tweezers, pins, and microscissors) under magnification.\nWith microscissors, bisect the larynx dorsally between the arytenoids using the midline between the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles as a landmark. Pin lateral walls of the larynx to expose the vocal folds and then bisect ventrally through the midline of the thyroid cartilage between the anterior commissure of the vocal folds with microscissors (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: This step can be optional; it can be skipped to keep the larynx whole. Bisection of larynges allow multiple immunostaining techniques by separately using the right and left sides of the same larynx.\nRinse each hemi-larynx in phosphate buffered solution (PBS) for ~10 s and delicately dry with a task wiper to reduce ice crystal formation during freezing.\n2. Fix and/or flash-freeze laryngeal tissue\nNOTE: Fixation may not be ideal for all immunostaining protocols. Often laryngeal tissues are flash-frozen fresh immediately following dissection. Skip step 2.1 to flash-freeze laryngeal tissue without fixation.",
    "To fix hemi-larynges place tissues in centrifuge tube filled with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 1 h at room temperature on an orbital shaker at 70 rpm. Transfer tissues to a clean centrifuge tube and rinse 3x for 20 min in PBS. Then transfer to a clean centrifuge tube and submerge in a 20% sucrose/5% glycerol solution (~18 h or until tissue sinks) at 4 °C.\n\tCAUTION: Formaldehyde is hazardous and should be used in a fume hood along with appropriate personal protective equipment.\nPlace all hemi-larynges in a uniform position into a cryo-mold filled with optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound. For a hemilarynx, place the tissue with the medial surface of the vocal fold facing the bottom of the cryomold and the longitudinal aspect of the vocal fold parallel to the lower edge of the cryomold opening. For whole larynges, place the tissue with the posterior cricoarytenoids facing the bottom of the cryomold and the longitudinal aspect of the vocal fold parallel to the lower edge of the cryomold opening.\n\tNOTE: Consistent laryngeal orientation within OCT compound is critical for cryosectioning of the rat vocal fold. Once the hemilarynx is embedded and frozen, it must be thawed to change its orientation, thereby introducing risks of tissue damage from multiple thaw-freeze cycles.\nFlash-freeze tissues using isopentane (2-methylbutane) chilled in a steel beaker surrounded by liquid nitrogen.\n\tNOTE: The isopentane reaches optimal temperature for tissue freezing when white precipitates start to form on the sides and bottom of the beaker13. Isopentane is used because it has a higher thermal conductivity than liquid nitrogen, which helps prevent cracking of the tissue block during rapid freezing. For a more detailed description of freezing tissue in OTC refer to Kumar et al.13.",
    "Wrap each mold in prelabeled foil and place in an individual freezer bag to prevent dehydration and immediately store on dry ice until transferred for storage in a -80 °C freezer.\n3. Cryosection hemilarynx in cross-sectional plane\nSet chamber temperature in the cryostat to -20 °C, which is in the middle of the temperature range (15−25 °C) recommended for muscle tissue sectioning by the manufacturer’s manual.\nSet cryostat section thickness to 10 µm thick sections.\n\tNOTE: For muscle fiber cross-sectional analysis, 10 µm thick sections are optimal to allow for complete staining and robust imaging intensity of the labeled muscle fibers for fiber typing analysis14,15,16. Some protocols may require different section thickness depending on neuromuscular targets.\nTransfer tissues to the cryostat chamber, add a uniform layer of OCT compound on the cryostat specimen disk (chuck), and place the embedded tissue block on top of the OCT compound on the specimen disk. To obtain cross-sections of the vocal fold for thyroarytenoid (TA) muscle fiber analysis, affix the specimen to the chuck so that the ventral thyroid cartilage faces the cryostat blade and the arytenoid cartilage faces the specimen disk.\n\tNOTE: It is critical to note that these landmarks are not visible at this stage, due to the OCT compound becoming white and opaque when frozen. This lack of visibility is why it is critical to note the orientation of the hemilarynx during the flash freezing stage.\nTrim OCT compound by advancing the specimen head by 100 µm until the ventral portion of the thyroid cartilage appears.\nThen trim and track 30 µm sections from the onset of the thyroid cartilage until the lamina propria, medial TA muscles, and lateral TA muscle are exposed.",
    "NOTE: Laryngeal landmarks should be tracked and noted from the onset of the thyroid cartilage every 100 µm to ensure the angle of sectioning is not oblique. Figure 2 represents the two sets of laryngeal landmarks in the cross-sectional plane at 10x magnification.\nOnce the target TA muscle is reached, collect sections on positively charged slides at 10 µm.\nStore sections in PBS at 4 °C to retain moisture until they are ready to be stained.\n\tNOTE: Fixed tissue can be stored in PBS up to one week depending on IHC target whereas unfixed tissue should be immediately processed.\n4. Cryosection hemilarynx in longitudinal plane\nWith the cryostat chamber again set to -20 °C, change the section thickness to 30 µm.\n\tNOTE: For NMJ analysis, a tissue thickness between 30−60 µm can be used to capture several complete NMJs within the laryngeal muscles without fragmentation of either the nerve terminal or motor endplate11,12,17.\nTo obtain longitudinal vocal fold sections for NMJ analysis of the TA muscle, affix the specimens to the chuck so that the epiglottis is oriented towards the cryostat blade and the tracheal lumen faces down towards the specimen disk.\nTrim the OCT compound by advancing the specimen head by 100 µm until the thyroid cartilage appears.\nTrim and track sections of 30 µm from the onset of the thyroid until the lamina propria and medial and lateral divisions of the TA muscle are exposed.\n\tNOTE: Five sets of laryngeal landmarks in the longitudinal plane are recommended to track tissue depth progression towards the target TA muscle. Figure 3 represents the laryngeal landmarks in the longitudinal plane at 10x magnification.\nOnce the target TA muscle is reached, collect sections on positively charged slides at 30 µm.",
