    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis protocol starts with cultured cells and focuses on three sections, 1) the fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) assay to measure the nuclear mRNA export, 2) a dual reporter system to measure the protein NCT, and 3) image analysis and data output using CellProfiler™ Software (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). For details on cell culture and reprogramming of human neurons, please refer to our previous publications (Akter et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Ding et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4], 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Sepehrimanesh et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]; Sepehrimanesh and Ding, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2121-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic shows the major steps of this protocol\nThe starting materials are cultured cells (e.g., fibroblast cells and neurons). Section 1: nuclear mRNA export measurement by FISH assay[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1], nuclear mRNA export measurement by the fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) assay. Section 2: protein NCT measurement by a dual reporter system[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2], protein NCT assay by a dual reporter, green fluorescent protein fused with the nuclear export sequence (GFP-NES) and red fluorescent protein fused with the nuclear localization sequence (RFP-NLS). Section 3: image analysis using CellProfiler software[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3], confocal image analysis followed by data output using CellProfiler™ Software.\nSection 1: Nuclear mRNA export measurement by FISH assay\nTiming: 3 days",
    "This section describes the protocol of measuring nuclear mRNA export using the FISH assay with oligo-dT probes, which specifically bind the poly(A) tails of mRNAs. Importantly, the FISH assay could be combined with immunocytochemistry (ICC) for detecting specific markers, which will be used to define the nucleus and the cytoplasm of target cells. This experiment consists of three major steps. 1) Cultured cells on coverslips are fixed and then hybridized with Digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled oligo-dT probes. 2) Following the standard ICC, mRNA signals are to be detected using the anti-DIG antibody, and the nucleus and/or cell identity markers will be co-stained with other compatible antibodies or dyes. 3) Based on confocal images, the subcellular distributions of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions for total mRNAs will be analyzed, and the nuclear mRNA export activity will be evaluated by the ratio of the oligo-dT signal in the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The higher ratio of dT(Nuc/Cyt) indicates compromised nuclear mRNA export.\nDay 1. In situ hybridization\nTiming: 2–4 h\nIn this step, DIG-labeled oligo-dT is used to probe mRNAs. To detect specific transcripts, the probes could be designed with the complementary sequence to the target RNAs and labeled with DIG. The following procedure is described based on cultured cells on coverslips in a 24-well plate.\nSet up in situ hybridization to detect mRNAs in cultured cells.\nRemove the culture media and briefly wash once with ∼250 μL per well of 1× PBS.\nAdd 250 μL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) per well and fix the cells at room temperature (RT) for 30 min.\nNote: The volume of 250 μL is based on the 24-well plate. Please adjust the volume if you use different culture plates or containers to perform this assay.",
    "Note: If samples cannot be processed immediately, replace PFA with 500 μL per well of 70% ethanol (diluted with the nuclease-free water). Seal the plate well to avoid drying out. It is not harmful to keep coverslips at −20°C for a few weeks without an obvious decrease in oligo-dT signals. Once you are ready, continue the process from step c).\nRemove PFA (or alternatively 70% ethanol from step b), wash with 1× PBS three times, each time 250 μL per well for 5 min.\nFor each well, add 250 μL of 1×HB without probe and incubate for 3 min at 37°C to equilibrate samples.\nRemove 1×HB without probe, add 250 μL of hybridization solution (1×HB with probe) that contains oligo-dT (or oligo-dA for negative control), yeast tRNA (to minimize the non-specific binding), and 20% formamide in 1× HB.\nIncubate overnight (10–16 h) at 37°C.\nNote: It is better to keep plates in a wet chamber during incubation to avoid drying out.\nDay 2. ICC to detect probes and specific cellular markers\nTiming: 8–10 h\nIn this step, antibodies are added sequentially and washed to detect oligo-dT probes. Some steps need to be performed at 37°C and others are performed at RT. The use of fresh buffer and high-quality antibodies in this step is very important.\nTo detect probe and cellular markers.\nThaw a formamide aliquot from −80°C to prepare a proper volume of wash buffer containing 20% formamide in 2× SSC.\nRemove hybridization solution.\nNote: Hybridization solution can be reused for up to 3 times.\nAdd 250 μL of 2× SSC containing 20% formamide and incubate for 15 min at 37°C.\nNote: For each wash step, carefully add/remove liquid from the edge of a well to avoid detaching cells from coverslips.",
    "Wash with 250 μL of 2× SSC per well for 15 min at 37°C.\nRemove 2× SSC and wash with 250 μL of 1× SSC per well for 15 min at 37°C.\nPrepare antibody mixture containing Sheep anti-DIG and RVC in 4× SSC.\nRemove 1× SSC, add 200 μL of Sheep anti-DIG solution (1:100) and incubate for 2 h at 37°C.\nRemove (and alternatively recycle) the Sheep anti-DIG solution.\nNote: After this step, the 37°C incubator is not required, and all the following steps will be performed at RT.\nWash with 250 μL of 4× SSC per well for 10 min at RT.\nRemove 4× SSC and wash with 250 μL of 4× SSC containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at RT.\nWash again with 250 μL of 4× SSC per well for 10 min at RT.\nRemove 4× SSC and fix cells with 250 μL of 4% PFA per well for 10 min at RT.\nRemove fixing buffer and wash with 250 μL of freshly prepared permeabilization buffer 1× PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (0.1% PBS-T) for 10 min at RT.\nNote: The following steps are the same as the standard ICC protocol (Ding et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9], 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5], 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nRemove permeabilization buffer and wash with 250 μL of 1× PBS for 10 min at RT.\nRemove 1× PBS and add the FITC-labeled Donkey anti-Sheep antibody (1:200) and incubate for 2 h at RT.\nNote: The FITC-labeled antibody is light sensitive and thus samples need to be kept from light in the following steps, e.g., by covering a plate with an aluminum foil.\nRemove the antibody solution and wash with 1× PBS three times at RT, 10 min for each time.",
    "Note: After this step, coverslips could be mounted on a glass slide and oligo-dT signals could be visualized based on FITC. Since the FITC signal is usually weak, perform the following steps to amplify the signal:\nRemove 1× PBS and incubate samples with 250 μL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in 1× PBS) for 10 min at RT.\nAdd Rabbit anti-FITC antibody (1:700) and Chicken anti-MAP2 (1:10,000), and incubate overnight (10–16 h) at 4°C.\nNote: Antibodies should be diluted in 3% BSA in 0.1% PBST to minimize non-specific binding.\nNote: Use different combinations of antibodies for specific samples to distinguish mRNA signals and other protein markers with different colors. If you will use a new secondary antibody that the specificity has not been verified, you need to set up a secondary antibody control.\nDay 3. mount coverslips and visualization\nTiming: 4–6 h\nThis step describes how to visualize mRNA probed with a primary antibody using fluorescent conjugated secondary antibodies. Using secondary antibodies with different colors to distinguish the oligo-dT signals and specific protein markers, imaging is recommended to be performed under a confocal microscope.\nRemove primary antibodies and wash four times with 250 μL of 1× PBS at RT, each time for 10 min.\nRemove 1× PBS of the last wash, add corresponding secondary antibodies, and incubate for 2 h at RT in dark. Here, we used AF488 Donkey anti-Rabbit (1:250) and AF594 Donkey anti-Chicken (1:250).\nNote: Antibodies should be diluted in 3% BSA in 0.1% PBS-T to minimize non-specific binding.\nNote: Usually, we use Alexa Fluor 488 for dT signals since it is brighter. If samples contain a GFP reporter, then use Alexa Fluor 594 for dT signals.",
    "Remove the secondary antibody solution and wash three times with 250 μL of 1× PBS at RT, and each time for 10 min.\nRemove 1× PBS from the last wash. Add the 250 μL of nuclei dye HST or DAPI (1 μg/mL in PBS) and incubate for 5 min at RT.\nRemove HST solution and wash with 250 μL of 1× PBS for 2 min at RT.\nBriefly wash with 250 μL of nuclease-free water for 1 min at RT.\nAir dry coverslips at RT (in dark) for 20 min or use a paper towel to carefully remove liquid from the edges of coverslips.\nMount coverslips on slides with a mounting medium. Allow mounting medium to be fully hardened at RT in dark (about 30 min to a few hours).\nNote: To preserve fluorescent signals, the slides should be kept at 4°C for short-term storage or at −20°C for long-term storage. If the mounting medium is not fully hardened, the cells could be detached from coverslip when visualizing samples.\nVisualize the FISH samples under a confocal microscope.\nNote: In this protocol, we used the Leica DMI 6000 CS Inverted Confocal Microscope with motorized stage, condenser, objective, and filter turrets. The objectives were used are 40× air lens (HCX PL APO CS 40×/0.75U-V-I 0.17) or 63× oil lens (HCX PL APO CS 63×/1.4–0.6NA) and the resolution of images is 1024 × 1024 pixels. Any equivalent confocal microscope with similar settings should be good to produce confocal images for later quantification analysis.\nConfocal image analysis (see section 3: image analysis using CellProfiler software[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3] of this protocol).\nSection 2: Protein NCT measurement by a dual reporter system\nTiming: 4 weeks",
    "In this section, we will describe the procedure to examine protein nuclear transport using a dual reporter system, in which GFP-NES and RFP-NLS are co-expressed (Mertens et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). Therefore, both protein export and import activities can be analyzed in individual cells. Direct transfection of a reporter plasmid could be employed for rapid-growing cells, such as HEK cells. For slow-growing postmitotic cells, such as primary and reprogrammed neurons, it is required to prepare appropriate lentivirus to deliver the reporter vector. To achieve high transduction efficiency and the proper expression of the dual reporter, it is critical to prepare a high-quality lentivirus.\nThis part consists of five major steps. 1) The dual reporter plasmid preparation, including the transformation of a plasmid into Stbl3 competent cells and plasmid midi preparation. 2) The validation of the dual reporter system in HEK cells with the treatment of Leptomycin B (LMB), a specific nuclear export inhibitor (Jang et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). 3) The dual reporter lentivirus preparation. This dual reporter system was constructed with the second-generation lentiviral vector. 4) Transduction of the dual reporter lentivirus to fibroblast cells or cultured neurons. 5) Dual reporter analysis. Depending on cell subtypes and the developmental stages to be analyzed, infected cells could be visualized at 1–4 wpi (weeks post-viral infection). Once the reporter system has been validated, only repeating steps 3–5 to measure the protein transport in cultured cells are needed.\nPreparation of a lentiviral vector\nTiming: 3–5 h\nThis step describes the purification of a lentiviral vector via plasmid Midi prep columns.\nTransform of a lentiviral vector to Stbl3™ chemical competent cells (or equivalent) and culture them in 50 mL of LB medium with 100 μg/mL Ampicillin.",
    "Note: For lentiviral plasmid preparation, the culture temperature between 30°C–35°C is better than 37°C in the maintenance of plasmid stability. The culture time to reach saturation varies according to the temperature, from overnight (10–16 h) to 30 h.\nThe next morning, collect the bacteria at 1,000 × g for 5 min.\nPurify the plasmid via Midi prep column according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For detailed information, please see User Guide: Plasmid Midiprep Kit (thermofisher.com[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0012653_GeneJET_Plasmid_Midiprep_UG.pdf]).\nExamine the plasmid concentration by using a NanoDrop and evaluate the plasmid quality by running an agarose gel.\nNote: A good yield of a plasmid midi prep is no less than 100 μg from a 50 mL culture. The quality of newly purified plasmids could be evaluated by the ratio of the absorbance at 260 and 280 nm (A260/280 ≧ 1.8) and by running an agarose gel. The desired plasmid DNA is the supercoiled form, which migrates faster than predicted (based on size) in an agarose gel due to its conformation. The major band on the agarose gel should be the supercoiled form.\nThe validation of the reporter system\nTiming: 7 days\nIn this step, the dual reporter system is validated in HEK cells with the treatment of Leptomycin B (LMB), a specific nuclear export inhibitor (Jang et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). In the presence of LMB, nuclear export of GFP-NES will be disrupted, while the distribution of RFP-NLS won’t be influenced.\nCulture HEK cells in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1× Pen/Strep in a CO2 incubator at 37°C.\nWhen cells reach about 80% confluency (∼2 or 3 days), collect cells by trypsinization with 0.05% Trypsin in PBS.",
    "Seed HEK cells onto gelatin coated-coverslips in a 12-well plate at the cell density of about 5 × 104 cells/cm2. After seeding, shake a plate well to reach homogenous cell density.\nNote: For coating coverslips, incubate coverslips with 0.2% gelatin at 37°C for more than 30 min.\nThe next day, HEK cells were transfected with reporter plasmid using PEI solution. For each well of the 12-well plate, add 1 μg plasmid and 4 μg PEI to 50 μL of serum-free DMEM.\nNote: It is better to prepare the transfection mixture for all wells together.\nImmediately mix the transfection mixture after the addition of PEI by either vortexing for 15 s or quickly pipetting up and down five times.\nIncubate the transfection mixture for 15 min at RT.\nAdd 50 μL of transfection mixture to each well of the 12-well plate and put it back into a CO2 incubator.\nThe next day, change the whole volume of HEK culture medium (1 mL/well).\nNote: 48–72 h post-transfection, distinct GFP and RFP signals can be noticed under a fluorescent microscope. Treat cells with Leptomycin B (LMB) as follows to validate the dual reporter system:\nPrepare a culture medium that contains 50 nM LMB.\nFully change the culture medium containing 50 nM LMB (1 mL/well).\nTake coverslips at 0-, 30-, 60- and 90-min post-exposure to LMB and directly mount them on slides.\nVisualize the cells by confocal microscope.\nConfocal micrographs will be analyzed by CellProfiler software as described in section 3: image analysis using CellProfiler software[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3] of this protocol.\nNote: The effectiveness of the dual reporter system can be demonstrated by the gradual accumulation of nuclear GFP signal, while the distribution of RFP will be not influenced.\nLentivirus preparation\nTiming: 4 days\nPreparation of lentivirus using HEK293T cells.",
    "Note: To examine the protein transport in post-mitotic cells such as cultured neurons, preparation of lentivirus expressing the dual reporters is necessary. This dual reporter system was constructed with the second-generation lentiviral vector. Two extra helper plasmids (psPAX2 and pCMV-VSVG) are required for the assembly of the viral particles. For more information about lentivirus preparation using the second-generation system, please refer to our previous report (Ding and Kilpatrick, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nCulture HEK293T cells as described in step 5.\nFor transfection, seed about 8 × 106 HEK cells in each 10 cm plate in a 10 mL HEK culture medium.\nNote: The next day, HEK cells should be around 80% confluency before transfection.\nPrepare the lentivirus transfection mixture in a 15 mL conical tube according to the recipe.\nFor each 10 cm plate, add 15 μg of a dual reporter plasmid, 10 μg of psPAX2 and 5 μg of pCMV-VSVG to 1 mL serum-free DMEM and mix well.\nNote: Scale up if more than one plate will be prepared.\nAdd 90 μg of PEI (90 μL of 1 μg/μL PEI stock) and immediately mix by vortexing for 15 s.\nLeave the transfection mixture for 15 min at RT.\nGently add 1 mL transfection mixture to each 10 cm plate and mix well to distribute it evenly.\nIncubate cells in a 37°C incubator.\nAfter overnight (∼16 h) exposure to transfection reagents, fully change the HEK culture medium.\nCollect viral supernatant at 24 h post medium change and add back 10 mL of the HEK culture medium to each plate. Put the plates back into the incubator and store the viral supernatant at 4°C.\nAfter another 24 h, collect the viral supernatant for the second time and discard the plate in a biohazard bag.",
    "Note: All lentivirus-contaminated materials (e.g., plates and pipettes) will be trashed in a container labeled with biohazard and processed according to the institutional biosafety protocol. Any spill of the lentivirus in the biosafety hood or other devices needs to be immediately wiped with 70% ethanol or 10% bleach.\nPool these two collections together. Filter the viral supernatants with 0.45 μm vacuum filters.\nStore viral supernatants at 4°C until the immediate use within two weeks or freeze them at −80°C for long-term storage.\nNote: The titer of the virus could be estimated by the transduction of HEK cells with a series of dilutions of the virus as previously reported (Ding and Kilpatrick, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). A good titer of lentiviral supernatants should be no less than 1 × 106 IFU/mL. (IFU, Infectious Unit).\nTransduction of the lentivirus to cultured cells\nTiming: 2 days\nThis step describes the transduction of the dual reporter lentivirus to human fibroblast cells or cultured neurons.\nCritical: To achieve a reasonable infection efficiency, the dosage of the virus should be optimized to transduce different cell types. Too much virus may cause more cell death.\nNote: The transduction efficiency and the cell survival should be well balanced. Generally, about 60% transduction efficiency is good enough to examine the protein transport in most samples. We usually employ 5 MOI (multiplicity of infection) to infect fibroblast cells, and around 2 MOI to transduce primary or iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs). For transduction of post-mitotic and differentiated neurons, we suggest using 3 or 4 MOIs.",
    "Note: In this step, iPSC-derived NPCs are taken as an example to show the procedure of transduction and examination of protein NCT using the dual reporter system. For more information about NPC generation and induction of specific neuronal subtypes, please refer to (Akter et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Ding, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Ding et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Sepehrimanesh and Ding, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]).\nPrepare a Matrigel-coated 6-well culture plate and incubate it for more than 30 min at 37°C.\nNote: For detailed to prepare Matrigel-coated plates, please refer to our previous report (Akter et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nQuick thaw an NPC frozen stock in a 37°C water bath and transfer cells into a 15 mL tube containing 5 mL of warm NPC medium.\nSpin down cells at 200 × g for 3 min.\nNote: For one frozen stock with 1 × 106 cells, seed onto 3 wells of a 6-well plate.\nGently resuspend cell pellets into a proper volume of NPC medium and seed NPCs onto Matrigel-coated plates at a density of 3 × 104 cells/cm2.\nWhen NPCs reach ∼60% confluence, add the proper amount of lentivirus to each well.\nNote: For lentivirus transduction, the proper NPC density (50%–60% confluence) is critical to obtain neurons with high yield and purity.\nNPCs are exposed to lentivirus for about 6 h to overnight (10–16 h). Replace the culture medium with Neuronal Maturation Medium.\nChange the half volume of Neuronal Maturation Medium every other day till analysis or replating.\nNote: The age of induced neurons (iNs) is counted from the lentiviral transduction as dpi (day post-viral infection). NPCs become neuron-like in morphology after 3 dpi.\nNote: Both GFP and RFP signals can be noticed at 3 dpi and the signal density increases gradually.",
    "The protein transport could be analyzed by imaging living cells under an inverted fluorescence microscope with the focus on dual reporter positive cells at desired time points.\nTo analyze the protein transport in mature neurons (more than 14 dpi), replate neurons onto coverslips with a monolayer of astrocytes at 5 dpi as previously reported (Akter et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). Change the half volume of Neuronal Maturation Medium every other day till analysis.\nAt desired time point, take the coverslips from the culture plate.\nIncubate coverslips with Hoechst 33342 (HST) (1 μg/mL in PBS) for 10 min at RT.\nBriefly rinse the coverslips twice with PBS and mount the coverslips on slides.\nImage samples with a confocal microscope.\nConfocal micrographs will be analyzed by CellProfiler software as described in section 3: image analysis using CellProfiler software[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3] of this protocol.\nThe ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic GFP(Nuc/Cyt) will be used to evaluate protein export, and the ratio of cytoplasmic to nuclear RFP(Cyt/Nuc) will be used to evaluate protein nuclear import.\nSection 3: Image analysis using CellProfiler software\nTiming: hours to days\nConfocal images of FISH assay or reporter assay could be analyzed using software such as ImageJ or CellProfiler™. At single cell levels, the subcellular distributions of dT signal or fluorescent protein levels will be measured. For each cell, as large an area as possible was measured within the nucleus or cytoplasm. An unbiased approach to data collection is recommended (Ding et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). For example, the individual performing the analysis using CellProfilter is completely blinded to sample information.",
    "Images of nuclear markers are needed to properly designate nuclear boundaries before beginning. Additionally, images of the stained translocated objects of interest are needed. Overlaying images are not required for quantification but can be used as controls to ensure the correct subcellular areas are selected for the measurement. The mean values are used to quantify an average signal density. For FISH assays, the average of oligo-dT signals in the soma (both nucleus and cytoplasm) was used to evaluate the overall mRNA expression levels. Nuclear mRNA export was measured by the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic oligo-dT signals (dT(Nuc/Cyt)). For the dual reporter assay, GFP and RFP signals will be separately measured in the nucleus and cytoplasm. The ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic GFP(Nuc/Cyt) is used to evaluate the protein export activity, while the ratio of cytoplasmic to nuclear RFP(Cyt/Nuc) is used to evaluate protein import activity. In this section, the confocal images of the FISH assay in fibroblast cells are used as an example to demonstrate the procedure of quantification.\nImport confocal images to CellProfiler\nTiming: 5–10 min\nThis step describes the import of confocal images using CellProfiler software.\nUpload images to be analyzed into the CellProfiler™ application images tab. This can be accomplished by dragging and dropping files into the designated box for files (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2121-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Under the NameAndTypes tab assign names to image matching rules. This allows the assignment of different names to images with specific criteria/alterations in downstream applications.\nAs the images are 2-dimensional, select no for “Process as 3D”.\nSelect “All” for matching rules of the image.\nSelect the rule criteria: This option states what the image contains. I.e., if the image contains images of chromatin staining, you will want to enter the following settings: “File” “Does” “Contain regular expression” “Title of photo uploaded that stains for chromatin”.\nEnter the name you wish to assign to the image.\nFor this experiment, color images are uploaded before converting them to grayscale. Because of this, you will set “Select the image type” as “Color image”\nSelect “Image metadata” for “Set intensity range from”. This will rescale fluorescence intensities for oversaturated areas of the image.\nRepeat the previous steps to include additional needed images such as overlayed images or other stained targets. At any time, you may enter test mode to run portions of your pipeline to ensure images are being processed properly.\nConvert color images to grayscale\nTiming: 5–10 min\nThis step describes the procedure of converting color images to grayscale.\nInsert a new module using the “+” button on the bottom left-hand side of the pipeline. This will open the module search tool.\nType in “ColorToGray”.\nAdd the Coloratura module to the pipeline by selecting the module and clicking \"+ Add to Pipeline\".\nSelect the image you would like to input to convert to grayscale. This will be the name you’ve entered in the NamesAndTypes tab. Depending on your signal, you can select split or combine as your conversion method.

    "Note: Optimal settings will depend on signal strength and crosstalk.\nSelect RGB for image type as .tif images are used.\nDepending on the color of the stain, select what channel you would like to convert to gray; Red to gray, green to gray, blue to gray.\nRepeat the previous 6 steps for each image you are using e.g., nucleoplasm signal image, cytoplasmic signal image, and overlayed image (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2121-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Scale bar: 20 μm.\nNote: If fluorescence is too sharp compared to the background signal, smoothing may be needed for the identification of edges. This can be accomplished using the “Smooth” module if needed.",
    "Note: Although standard settings may be adequate for identifying nuclei, advanced settings are good for reducing false positives and nuclei that may not be completely in focus. Upon opening advanced settings, select the image you will be used for primary object (nuclei) identification (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nAssign a name to the primary objects identified.\nDepending on the nuclei, adjust the maximum and minimum diameter of the primary object to be possessed.\nNote: Depending on magnification and cell type, this setting may need adjustment to get the most accurate counts.\nTo avoid inaccurate signal measurements, select to discard images outside the diameter parameters as well as those touching the edges of the image.\nFor threshold strategy, select “Global”. This identifies pixels as foreground or background signals.\nSelect “Manual” as the thresholding method. Depending on the image, the threshold smoothing scale and manual threshold settings may need to be increased or decreased to best properly identify objects.\nFor the method of distinguishing both clumped objects and dividing lines between clumped objects, select “No”.\nNote: Depending on cell type, quality of image, and staining quality, mixing and matching the methods of identifying clumped objects may be needed to produce the most accurate results.\nSelect “No” for log transforming before thresholding.\nAutomatically calculating the size of the smoothing filter may be sufficient for discerning different objects. If not, select “No” to automatically calculate the size of the smoothing filter.\nNote: If many nuclei are being clumped together and counted as single objects, the value of the smoothing filter may need to be higher to increase the accuracy of counts. As with adjusting the smoothing filter, automatic calculation of the minimum allowed distance between intensity maxima may be sufficient in differentiating objects. If you find incorrect clumping of objects, select “No” for this option.",
    "Lower values for the suppression of local maxima will help in properly splitting nuclei that may still be clumped together as a single object. Select “No” for the options to speed up the processing using a lower resolution image to find local maxima and “No” for the option to display local maxima. If you would like to view local maxima, you can select “Yes.\nSelect “After both thresholding and declumping for the option to fill holes in identified objects and select “Continue” for the handling of objects if an excessive number of objects are identified (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nFor adjusting nuclei pixel area and getting more accurate signals, open the module search tool as mentioned in the methods of converting images to grayscale. The module is titled “ExpandOrShrinkObjects”. Select the input objects you will be shrinking and name the resulting output objects (e.g., the resulting shrunken nuclei).\nSelect to shrink the objects by a specified number of pixels.\nNote: Depending on the magnification, the number of pixels to shrink can be adjusted, with a higher number being indicative of a greater degree of shrinking of the object (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nThis step describes the settings for identifying the secondary object (cell body) based on Oligo-dT signals.\nNote: Depending on cell type, different images may be used for identifying secondary objects as a lack of signal in the nuclei can produce errors in object identification. The input objects will be the nuclei identified in the previous step. This will be the structure which the secondary objects will be built around and associated with.\nAfter assigning a name to the secondary objects, select “Watershed-Gradient” as the method of identifying secondary objects.",
    "Note: The thresholding strategy will be adaptive for the secondary object with the thresholding method being minimum cross-entropy. As with the primary object, settings such as threshold smoothing, and thresholding correction factor can be adjusted to reduce improper clumping of objects.\nNote: A value of 0.1 for the threshold smoothing scale and correction factor was found to produce accurate object identification in most cases. Adjusting the lower and upper bounds on thresholds will, after calculating threshold values, allow the program to automatically throw out objects that are outside the calculated threshold. 0.1–1 was found to produce accurate counts in most cases for associated stains.\nFor the size of an adaptive window, use a multiple of the largest expected object size you estimate will be present. This can vary based on magnification and cell type.\nSelect “No” for: Log transforming before thresholding and filling holes in identified objects.\nSelect “No” for discarding secondary objects touching the edges of the image.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2121-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Scale bar: 20 μm.\nNote: Depending on cell type and object areas, you may elect to remove cells that are not 100% in the frame. If done, removing the associated primary objects will also be required to ensure the correct secondary objects are associated with the correct primary objects (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nThis step describes the settings to designate a tertiary object (cytoplasm). In this case (the FISH assay of fibroblast cells), the tertiary object will be the cell body minus the nucleus (i.e., the cytoplasmic signal only).\nInsert the “IdentifyTertiaryObjects” module.",
    "Note: The larger object will serve as the parent object and will surround the smaller (child) object. In this case, the parent object will be the output generated from the secondary object module and the child object will be the output generated from the expand or shrink module for the primary objects.\nAssign a name for the objects identified and select “No” for the option to shrink objects prior to subtraction, as the previous shrink object module has already reduced the primary object’s area (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2121-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

Scale bar: 20 μm.\nNote: CellProfiler™ is supposed to correctly associate objects when necessary, but the following steps serve as a means to manually check that the correct nuclei and cell bodies are being counted. This helps avoid issues where the nucleus that is in a frame is counted, while the body (secondary object) is excluded due to previously set up parameters.\nOpen the module search tool and load the “DisplayDataOnImage” module into the pipeline.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2121-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

These parameters, among others, including filtering what data you require, column delimination, and what values you want such as means, medians, and standard deviations.\nNote: Depending on experiment requirements, you can choose to include or omit certain measurements such as the area and locations objects occupy. This is achieved by selecting “No” for the option to export all data measurements (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]).\nBased on oligo-dT signal density in the nucleus (Primary Object) and the cytoplasm (Tertiary Object), calculate the ratio of dT(Nuc/Cyt). The higher ratio of dT(Nuc/Cyt) indicates compromised nuclear mRNA export.\nNote: Take special note of the names of both images and objects, as the same object may be identified on more than one image."
