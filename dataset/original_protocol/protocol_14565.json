    "All protocols were carried out in compliance with the policies of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee where applicable.\n1. Preparation\nPrepare the stabilization media with 75% Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), 25% Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). Mix well, aliquot and store at -20 °C until use.\nPrepare the Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) and sterilize by autoclaving. Store the solution at room temperature. Warm the PBS to 37 °C before the experiment (5 ml per well).\nPrepare 10%, 20% and 30% sucrose in PBS. Filter all the solutions individually over separate 0.22 μm filters for sterilization. Save the solutions at 4 °C.\nPrepare the histamine stock solution in PBS to a concentration of 90 mM. Sterilize the solution by filtering over a 0.22 µM filter. Aliquot and save the solution at -80 °C. Avoid multiple freeze-and-thaw cycles.\nMake fresh 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS before the experiment. Place it on ice.\n\tCaution: Keep PFA in a fume hood and wear appropriate protective equipment.\nThaw the stabilization medium (20 ml per retina). Add Penicillin-Streptomycin to a final concentration of 100 U/ml. Warm part of the medium (15 ml per retina) to 37 °C in incubator before the experiment. Leave the rest of the medium on ice.\nPlace the HBSS (10 ml per retina) on ice.\n2. Retinal Organotypic Culture\nTransfer the samples to a tissue culture hood. Open the eyecup by cutting around the lens. Using a brush, gently remove the vitreous humor without pulling on the retina. Gently detach the retina from the cut edge with a brush to expose the optic disc. Severe the optic nerve with a razor and release the retina.",
    "Transfer the retina into a Petri dish and carefully rinse the retina once using cold HBSS. Place the sample in HBSS on ice. Dissect as many retinas out as needed by repeating Step 2.1 and this step.\nCut the retina in half symmetrically with a razor. Gently transfer samples to a 6-well plate with 3 ml of stabilization media per well. Allow equilibration for 30 min at 37 °C in an incubator with the atmosphere containing 5% CO2.\nPrepare the following reagents during the incubation at Step 2.3: Dilute the histamine stock solution to the desired concentration (450 μM) in warm medium. Dissolve LXA4 (stored under Argon) into the medium to a final concentration of 250 ng/ml.\n\tNOTE: When measuring the effect of LXA4, one half from a single retina is used for histamine alone, while the other half is used for histamine with LXA4.\nAspirate the stabilization medium carefully and add the prepared medium to each well (3 ml per well). Incubate the samples at 37 °C for 1 hr in an incubator with the atmosphere containing 5% CO2.\nRinse the samples once in warm, sterile PBS.\n3. Prepare the Samples for Immunostaining\nAspirate PBS from the plates. Add 4% PFA (3 ml per well) and incubate for 15 min at room temperature.\nQuickly aspirate the PFA. Rinse the samples once using PBS. Transfer the samples to 10% sucrose (5 ml per well) and incubate for 2 to 4 hr at 4 °C.\nTransfer the samples to a 30% sucrose (5 ml per well) and incubate overnight at 4 °C. Mix one part of the commercial freezing medium with two parts of 20% sucrose to make the working freezing medium. Leave it at 4 °C overnight or longer until the air bubbles disappear.",
    "Transfer the samples to the working freezing medium and allow equilibration for 5 min at room temperature. Trim each retina into rectangles (roughly 3 mm by 5 mm).\nCarefully transfer the samples into the working freezing media contained in a cylindrical container (about 1 cm radius x 2 cm height) devised from aluminum foil. Ensure that the retinal slices are vertical (oriented to provide a cross-section of the retina upon sectioning) and freeze them in liquid nitrogen. Save the blocks at -80 °C until use.\nSection each block on a cryostat into 14 μm thick slices and mount the sections on glass slides. Store the slides at -80 °C until use.\n4. Immunostaining\nWash the sections with 5% sucrose phosphate buffer (SPB, 5% sucrose in PBS, pH 7.4) once. Block the non-specific binding sites by incubating the sections in blocking buffer (5% SPB with 10% normal goat serum and 0.5% Triton X-100) for 1 hr at room temperature.\nIncubate the sections (on slides) with the appropriate primary antibody (GFAP or MAP2, diluted at 1:500 in blocking buffer) for 1 hr. Aspirate the solution. Wash three times in 5% SPB. For staining the endogenous IgG, skip this step.\nIncubate the sections with the corresponding secondary antibodies (Cyanine3/FITC conjugated donkey anti-mouse/anti-rabbit IgG, diluted at 1:800 in the blocking buffer) for 1 hr.\nWash the sections thoroughly with 5% SPB three times. Prepare the samples for microscopy by mounting them in mounting medium containing DAPI and covering with coverslips.",
    "Using a laser confocal microscope, capture images through a 20X lens under identical parameters such as laser intensity, gain value, dwell time, etc. across groups. Set the excitation/emission wavelengths for the blue channel (to detect DAPI) as 408/447 nm, for the red channel (to detect Cyanine3) as 561/785 nm and for the green channel (to detect FITC) as 488/525 nm.\n5. Image Analysis\nQuantify percentage of leaky blood vessels according to the following criteria12: Include only blood vessels with endothelial cell nuclei within the plane of section in the count; consider a blood vessel leaky if it shows a gradient of immunostaining surrounding the vessel.\nTo determine the expression level, select regions of interest and measure the mean grey value using the image analysis software.\nTo measure the width of the process, choose an area of the section where the processes are distinct (the outer nuclear layer, ONL, for example). Then choose an optical field where such processes are visible and continuous. Set the scale bar according to the microscopic setting, draw a line across the process and perform the measurement.\nTo analyze the continuity of the process, select regions of interest, apply the filter called variance which enhances the edges in the image by replacing each pixel with its neighborhood variance, automatically adjust the contrast and brightness, count the lines and normalize the count by the area.\nCalculate statistical significances using a two-tailed Student's t-test. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001. Plot the result as Mean ± SEM.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
