    "All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the Minneapolis VA Medical Center and the University of Minnesota. Follow current National Institutes of Health guidelines for the use and care of laboratory animals.\n1. Hibernation Surgery\nAnimal Preparation\n\t\nTo create a model of hibernating myocardium, use 5-week old, female, Yorkshire pigs, which weigh in the range of 8-10 kg with 9.2 kg as the average weight.\nFor pre-surgical health monitoring, weigh the animal within 3 days prior to surgery.\nFast the animal for 12 h before starting anesthesia. Ensure that water is available at all times for fasting animals.\nGive SR Buprenorphine 0.18 mg/kg IM 24 h prior to the surgery.\nInduction\n\t\nSedate the animal with 6.6 mg/kg tiletamine-zolazepam and xylazine cocktail given intramuscularly. Allow 5-15 min for the drug cocktail to take effect.\nPrepare the ear vein aseptically by wiping three times with 70% isopropyl alcohol for IV catheter placement.\n\t\tNOTE: If an ear vein is not adequate, another peripheral vein may be used (i.e. cephalic).\nApply ophthalmic ointment to both eyes to prevent corneal drying.\nIf necessary, induce anesthesia by administering 1-2 mg/kg of propofol IV or masked with 3 L/min of oxygen and 3% isoflurane, to allow for tracheal intubation.\n\t\t​NOTE: The animal is considered appropriately anesthetized when the blink reflex or jaw tone is absent.\nIntubate the animal with an appropriately sized endotracheal tube.\nSurgery\n\t\nOnce the animal is anesthetized, shave the left thoracic area for the surgery.\nInitiate the mechanical ventilation at 10-15 breaths per min. Set oxygen at 1-4 L/min, and isoflurane between 1.0 and 3.0% as needed to maintain a surgical plane of anesthesia.\nPlace the monitoring devices on the animal. Monitoring devices should include ECG, blood pressure, temperature, and pulse oximeter.",
    "Connect the IV catheter to an IV drip with 0.9% normal saline at a rate of 5-10 mL/kg/h.\nAseptically prepare the left lateral chest with an FDA approved surgical scrub.\nEvaluate the depth of anesthesia every 5-15 min. Record the baseline vital signs (heart rate, ECG, SpO2, NIBP, ETCO2 and temperature) every 15 min.\n\t\tNOTE: The animal is considered appropriately anesthetized when the blink reflex or jaw tone is absent.\nWith the animal laying on its right side, place sterile drapes the left side of the chest from the spine to the scapula centering the third rib space in the sterile field.\n\t\tNOTE: The sterile field involves left front shoulder including the axillary area continuing to the sternum to the sixth rib space cranially.\nGently scrub the field with an FDA approved surgical method such as chlorhexidine gluconate or an iodine surgical scrub for 2 min using a target pattern.\nRinse the field with water and wash it two more times with an FDA approved method as above for 2 min. Rinse the surgical field with water in between washes, then pat dry with sterile toweling or 4 x 4 cm gauze sponges.\nSpray the area with an iodine solution and drape the entire animal (except the surgical field) with sterile drapes. Use steam or gas sterilization to sterilize the instruments, gowns, and drapes for the procedure.\nAdminister an intercostal nerve block using 0.3 mL of 0.5% bupivicaine at the 2nd, 3rd and 4th ribs.\nGive 125 mg of cefazolin IV before opening the chest.\n\t\tNOTE: 1.5 mg/kg succinylcholine IV may be given as a paralytic agent to reduce muscle movement per surgeon's request during the opening of the chest cavity.",
    "Expose the heart via a left thoracotomy. Prior to heart manipulation, give a 2 mg/kg IV bolus of lidocaine to prevent arrhythmia. Make the lateral 3rd space thoracotomy incision with monopolar electrocautery. The incision should extend from the cranial aspect of the scapula to the axillary area for approximately 10 cm. Use a cautery to incise the skin and underlying musculature to allow the entry into the chest cavity.\nPlace a finochietto rib retractor and enter the pleural space at the third intercostal space to retract the lung.\nSharply incise the pericardium and retract to the side using 2-0 polyglactin stay sutures, exposing the LAD artery and vein. Retract the left atrial appendage with a gauze-covered spatula retractor.\nUsing iris scissors, open the adventitia over the LAD.\nBluntly dissect an approximately 0.25 cm portion of the LAD artery approximately 1 cm distal to the LAD and circumflex artery junction. Use a right-angle clamp to encircle the LAD.\nPlace two 4-0 polyester sutures around the artery without placing any tension.\nPlace a plastic c-shaped constrictor with an internal diameter of 1.5 mm on the LAD proximal to the first diagonal without occluding the vessel.\nSecure it with two 4-0 polyester ties encircling the LAD.\nLoosely close the pericardium using 2-0 polyglactin suture in a simple interrupted pattern.\nPerform a breath hold to remove air from the chest while the intercostal muscle layer is closed. Carefully monitor the airway pressure manometer on the anesthesia machine to maintain the pressure in a proper range of 20-30 cm of water and release when complete.\n\t\tNOTE: This eliminates the need for a chest tube in the post-operative period.\nClose the muscle and skin layers in the standard fashion using 2-0 and 3-0 absorbable suture.\nUse skin adhesive over the incision for skin closure.",
    "Administer a total dose of 1 mg/kg bupivacaine intramuscularly at multiple sites along the length of the incision at the end of the procedure. Administer meloxicam 0.2 mg/kg SQ before transport to the recovery area.\nWean the animal off the ventilator as the skin layer is closed.\nLeave the animal connected to the anesthesia machine until it can spontaneously breathe and protective reflexes begin to return.\nDo not remove the endotracheal tube until the animal can swallow to protect its airway.\nApply a sterile, non-adherent dressing with triple-antibiotic ointment over the incision.\nPost-Surgery\n\t\nRecord the heart rate, respiration rate, body temperature and mucous membrane color every 15 min until the animal can hold a sternal position unassisted.\nDo not leave the animal unattended until it can lift and hold its head up and can stand unassisted.\nGive meloxicam (0.2 mg/kg) subcutaneously.\nAdminister sustained release buprenorphine 6 h following the initial pre-surgical dose.\nLeave the dressing on the incision for up to 3 days, if it remains clean and dry. Replace the dressing if it becomes soiled.\nMonitor the pain level, general well-being and the condition of the incision for 5 days following the procedure.\n\t\tNOTE: A piglet grimace scale is now available to assess the level of pain in these animals post-operatively14. Use half dose meloxicam as needed once per day for breakthrough pain.\nSingle-house the animal during the recovery period of 5 day to limit activity and allow the wound to heal.\nAllow 8 weeks to fully develop the hibernating myocardium phenotype.\n2. Revascularization or Off Pump Bypass\nAnimal Preparation\n\t\nWeigh the animal within 3 days prior to surgery.\nFast the animal for 12 h prior to surgery. Ensure that water is available at all times for fasting animals.",
    "Give sustained release buprenorphine 0.18 mg/kg intramuscularly 24 h prior to the surgery.\nInduction\n\t\nSedate the animal with 6.6 mg/kg tiletamine-zolazepam/xylazine cocktail intramuscularly. 5-15 min after the sedation, prepare the ear vein aseptically for catheter placement.\n\t\t​NOTE: If an ear vein is not adequate, another peripheral vein may be used (i.e. cephalic).\nApply ophthalmic ointment to both eyes.\nInduce anesthesia with 1-2 mg/kg of propofol IV.\nIntubate the animal with an appropriately sized endotracheal tube.\nSurgery\n\t\nShave the animal's sternum, left lateral chest and femoral triangles for the surgery.\nSet mechanical ventilation to 10-15 breaths per minute, oxygen at 1-4 L/min, and isoflurane at 1.0-3.0% as needed to maintain a surgical plane of anesthesia.\nPosition the monitoring equipments (heart rate, ECG, SpO2, direct blood pressure, ETCO2 and temperature) on the animal.\nConnect the IV catheter to an IV drip with normal saline or LRS.\nAseptically prepare the skin with povidone iodine scrub or other FDA approved method.\nEvaluate the animal for the depth of anesthesia.\n\t\tNOTE: The animal is considered deeply anesthetized when the eye or jaw reflex is absent.\nPosition the animal dorsally, prepare the skin as previously described and drape the animal with sterile towels.\nPerform a cut down to the femoral artery and cannulation. Use monopolar electrocautery to create an approximately 3 cm skin incision over the femoral artery to expose it for cannulation.\nPerform a femoral nerve block after the incision is made, to allow precise placement of drug. Connect the femoral cannula to a transducer to monitor blood pressures during the surgery.\nUse electro-cautery to incise from the manubrium to the xiphoid process, as well as to incise the muscle, adipose, and connective tissue to the level of the sternum.\nDivide the sternum with an oscillating saw.",
    "NOTE: Using an oscillating saw, rather than a standard sternal saw avoids potential myocardial injury from pericardial adhesions as a result of the thoracotomy for constrictor placement on the LAD.\nAdminister lidocaine (2 mg/kg IV loading dose, 50 µg/kg/min continuous IV infusion) to prevent arrhythmias. Dilute lidocaine in a 500 mL bag of normal saline at a concentration of 1 mg/mL.\nDivide the posterior sternal plate with straight Mayo scissors.\nUse a chest retractor to expose the thoracic cavity.\nTake down the adhesions with monopolar electro-cautery.\nUsing the same retractor, with gentle elevation of the left sternal border by an assistant, dissect the left internal mammary artery free from the chest wall.\nControl the arterial branches with hemoclips.\nHeparinize the animal with 100-300 units/kg of heparin IV.\nAfter 3 min, divide the artery with the distal end over sewn. Prepare the proximal end for grafting.\nOpen and retract the pericardium. Confirm that the length of the LIMA is adequate to reach the appropriate anastomotic site on the LAD.\nPerform the LIMA to LAD anastomosis with 7-0 polypropylene suture using an off pump technique with a cardiac stabilizer, spring form clip, and appropriately sized intraluminal devices.\nPlace a chest tube between the ribs on the left lateral chest, externalized and attached to vacuum to remove air from the chest cavity for 15-30 min.\nApproximate the sternum with #5 polyester sutures using a figure eight pattern.\nClose the muscle, subcutaneous and skin layers in the usual fashion as described in the Hibernation surgery. Remove the chest tube while performing a Valsalva maneuver to remove any residual air from the chest cavity and close the incision with one skin suture.",
    "Apply skin adhesive over the skin to protect the sternal incision. Gently remove the femoral catheter and repair the artery using 7-0 polypropylene suture in a purse string pattern. Close the skin using 2-0 polyglactin suture in a subcuticular pattern.\nAdminister a total dose of 1 mg/kg bupivacaine intramuscularly at multiple sites along the length of the incision at the end of the procedure.\nAdminister meloxicam 0.2 mg/kg subcutaneously before transport to the recovery area.\nFollow the post-operative protocol in the hibernation procedure.\nSubscription Required.
