Timepoint zero (T0) is usually indicated as the day in which the MOI is measured and a sample for sequencing is collected to use as a reference baseline for sgRNA distribution in the initial cell population. Timepoints before T0 are indicated with a minus sign e.g., T-4, T-3, etc.\nsgRNA coverage estimation. This is an important step as it is necessary to calculate the requirements for cells and reagents (media and plates). sgRNA representation (or coverage) is the number of cells independently infected by an sgRNA-expressing lentivirus. We aim to do our coverage at 400× but other groups have reported successful screens at lower representation (150–300×). To estimate how many cells are needed for reaching NX coverage can be calculated as follow: NX coverage number of cells = n of sgRNA in the TKOv3 ∗ N coverage",
    "This means that, in order to have all 71,090 sgRNAs in the TKOv3 library present within 400 cells post-infection (on average), at least 28.4 × 106 cells need to be infected at T0 and this amount of cells must be minimally maintained throughout the screen i.e., be seeded and collected at each time point. For this reason, if the infection efficiency estimated is 30%, it is important to infect at least (28.4 × 106) / 0.3 at T0. From a statistical point of view, it has been demonstrated that conducting two technical replicates (here called “A” and “B”) is sufficient for robust CRISPR screens (Hart et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). To help with the planning of the screen, please refer to Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]: process flow diagram for a chemogenetic CRISPR/Cas9 dropout screen.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/461-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. General workflow of a dropout genotoxic CRISPR screen using the TKOv3 library\nEstimate number of cells to infect. According to the coverage, it is important to infect at least 28.4 × 106 at T-4. When using a MOI of ∼0.3, that results in needing to infect at least 28 × 106 / 0.3 = ∼93 × 106 cells. This means that, if 3 × 106 cells are seeded per plate at T-4, at least 31 × 15 cm plates are required. However, to avoid having to repeat the infection due to an unexpectedly low MOI, estimate the number of cells to be infected at T-4 using a MOI of 0.2. For this reason, for a screen ∼150 × 106 cells are infected, for a total of 50 × 15 cm plates.",
    "Estimation of the number of plates and cells required for each timepoint. Knowing exactly how many conditions and replica are required for each step, how many treatments to start at T6 and how many reagents to have it is vital to avoid ending up with an unmanageable number of plates. For this reason, it is very helpful to design your own screen layout (using Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] as template) in order to know not only the reagents required but how to expand and prepare the place from timepoint to timepoint.\nCritical: It is important to minimize the risk of contamination during the screen. An accidental contamination during any timepoint will compromise the entire screen. Sterilize incubator shelves before commencing the screen. Thoroughly clean every surface (biosafety cabinet, incubator, door handles, reagent bottles) with of 70% ethanol before commencing the screen. Always use fresh media and a newly thawed bottle of P/S at the beginning of the screen. To avoid contamination while mixing large volumes of cells, use sterile T175 flasks standing on end as containers to collect and mix the cells.\nNote: All the calculations reported here are for the exact number of cells, plates, and volumes required for the screen. However, to compensate for potential pipetting errors, one can calculate the cells and reagents needed for an extra plate, which should ensure enough reagents and cells.\nDay T-7: Plate cells for the screen.\nPlate 3 × 106 RPE1-hTERT cells in 15 × 15 cm plates in 20 mL of DMEM complete.\nDay T-4: Infection with TKOv3 library\nRemove media and wash plates with 10 mL of PBS.\nAdd 3 mL of trypsin to the plates and gently rock the plates to get complete coverage of the cell layer.\nIncubate for 5 min at 37°C.",
    "Resuspend the plate with 10 mL of DMEM complete. Break up all cell clumps by pipetting the cells up and down 2–3 times at fast speed against the bottom of the plate.\nHarvest all plates for a total of at least 150 × 106 RPE1-hTERTcells into a T175 flask.\nCount the number of viable cells per mL of media.\nPrepare a control plate (no-lentivirus control) by seeding 3 × 106 in a 15 cm plate with 20 mL of complete DMEM and 8 μg/mL of polybrene. Gently rock the plate to evenly distribute the cells and place in the 37°C incubator.\nGenerate the cell-virus mix for the infection using two T175 flasks standing on end. Add media and cells first, then add polybrene, and mix thoroughly. Last, add the lentiviral library and mix thoroughly again inverting the flask 10–15 times. This is the mix for seeding 50 × 15 cm plates (+1 extra plate that will be the no-puromycin control, see T-2 timepoint. This is the total master mix to be split into 2 flasks):\n153 × 106 RPE1-hTERTcells\n510 μL of polybrene (16 mg/mL stock solution; 8 μg/mL final concentration, 1:2,000)\nTKOv3 sgRNA library virus according to MOI calculation\nBring to a total of 1,020 mL with DMEM complete.\nPipette up and down with a 50 mL pipet alternating inverting the T175 flask several time to ensure correct mixing. Mix the cell-virus solution well, transferring it from the 2 flasks to homogeneously distribute cells and reagents.\nPlate 20 mL of the cell-virus mix in each 15 cm plate. Label one plate as the no-puromycin control.\nGently rock the plates to evenly distribute the cells (ensure it by inspecting some random plates under the microscope) and incubate the plates in the 37°C incubator.\nDay T-3: Change media",
    "Prepare 1,040 mL of fresh DMEM complete.\nVisually inspect several plates under the phase-contrast microscope. Confluency and viability of infected cells should be equivalent to that observed during the MOI determination.\n24 h after seeding the infected cells, aspirate the medium from each plate (including the no-lentivirus and no-puromycin control plates).\nGently add 20 mL of fresh DMEM complete to each plate.\nIncubate the plates in the 37°C incubator.\nDay T-2: Puromycin selection\nPrepare 1,020 mL of fresh DMEM complete.\nAdd 2.04 mL of puromycin (stock solution 10 mg/mL; final concentration 20 μg/mL). Note: the amount of puromycin used for selection must be determined prior to the screen.\nAspirate the media from the screen plates.\nAdd 20 mL of DMEM with puromycin.\nIn the no-puromycin control plate, simply change the media with 20 mL of DMEM complete without puromycin.\nDay T-1: Resuspend cells in media with puromycin.\nAspirate media and wash with 10 mL warm PBS per plate.\nAdd 3 mL of trypsin per plate to detach the cells.\nIncubate 5 min in the 37°C incubator.\nResuspend cells with 17 mL of complete DMEM containing 23.5 μg/mL of puromycin; the final concentration will be 20 μg/mL in a total volume of 20 mL. Using a 10 mL pipet, break up all cell clumps by pipetting the cells up and down 2–3 times at fast speed against the bottom of the plate.\nReseed cells in the same plates by gently rocking the plates to evenly distribute the cells.\nIncubate plates in the 37°C incubator.\nDay T0: Collect and count cells\nAssess selection with the no-lentivirus control plate by inspecting it under the microscope. You should see that almost all cells are dead.\nAspirate media from screen plate and wash with 10 mL warm PBS per plate.",
    "Add 3 mL of trypsin per plate to detach the cells.\nIncubate 5 min in the 37°C incubator.\nResuspend in 10 mL of DMEM complete. Break up all cell clumps by pipetting the cells up and down 2–3 times at fast speed against the bottom of the plate. Total volume of 13 mL per plate.\nCollect all the cells into two sterile T175 flasks.\nHarvest the no-puromycin control plates in the same manner as the screen plates.\nCalculate the MOI for the screen by dividing the viable cells per mL in the large pool of puromycin selected cells by the number of cells per mL in the no-puromycin control plate (once the MOI is calculated, discard the cells from the no-puromycin control plates). Proceed with the screen if the MOI obtained is between 0.3 and 0.5. If the MOI is between 0.2 and 0.3, we usually seed 30% more cell for the next time point to ensure adequate coverage.\nPrepare sequencing cell pellets (each pellet should contain at least 28.4 × 106 cells to achieve the desired coverage of the library):\nPrepare 3–4 × 50 mL conical tubes with at least 28.4 × 106 cells each.\nCentrifuge tubes at 500 × g for 5 min using a centrifuge with swinging buckets.\nAspirate the media, being careful not to disturb the cell pellet.\nWash the pellet with 10 mL of warm PBS.\nTransfer the resuspended cells in 15 mL tubes.\nSpin the cells down at 500 × g for 5 min using a centrifuge with swinging buckets.\nAspirate the PBS, being careful not to disturb the cell pellet.\nClose the tubes tightly and snap freeze them in liquid nitrogen for 2 min.\nStore the pellets at −80°C until you are ready to perform genomic DNA extraction.",
    "Plate the remaining cells into 2 technical replicates (here referred as “A” and “B”). For each replicate, library coverage of 400× also needs to be maintained:\nReplicateA: plate 15 × 15 cm plates, 3 × 106 cells per plate.\nReplicateB: plate 15 × 15 cm plates, 3 × 106 cells per plate.\nPlate the cells by gently rocking the plates to evenly distribute the cells.\nIncubate the plates in the 37°C incubator.\nCritical: It is extremely important to collect a cell pellet at T0 in order to evaluate the overall quality of the screen. One T0 sample must be sequenced in order to assess sgRNA distribution in the initial infected population and to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) of the precision-recall curves for the screen quality control. For this reason, collect more than one pellet (at least 2, suggested are 3–4 pellets) in order to have possible back up samples.\nNote: We noted that the RPE1-hTERT cells usually experience a slowdown in proliferation after T0, with a return to normal growth by T6-T9. Plating 1.5 X coverage of cells (∼45 × 106 cells in 15 cm plates per replicate) is a good precaution to avoid losing the 400× coverage.\nDay T3: resuspend and reseed the cells\nAspirate media and wash with 10 mL warm PBS per plate.\nAdd 3 mL of trypsin per plate and gently rock the plates to get complete coverage of the cell layer.\nIncubate for 5 min at 37°C.\nResuspend the plate with 10 mL of DMEM complete. Break up all cell clumps by pipetting the cells up and down 2–3 times at fast speed against the bottom of the plate.\nHarvest all plates into two T175 flask, i.e., one for each replicate.",
    "Count the cells and replate 15 plates per replicate with 3 × 106 cells per plate.\nPlate the cells by gently rocking the plates to evenly distribute the cells.\nIncubate the plates in the 37°C incubator.\nNote: T3 is important to expand cells in order to have enough for all the treatments to be applied starting from T6. Seeding 15 plates per replicate will lead to ∼150 × 106 cells at T6. With this number of cells, it is possible to split them into 3 treatments along with one untreated condition (∼36 × 106 cells per treatment at genotoxic concentration of LD20, see “Estimating LD20 concentrations[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3]” in the “Before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]” section). If you plan to screen more conditions, you need to seed more plates at T3, accordingly.\nDay T6: Split replicates into treated versus untreated conditions\nAspirate media and wash with 10 mL warm PBS per plate.\nAdd 3 mL of trypsin to the plates and gently rock the plates to get complete coverage of the cell layer.\nIncubate for 5 min at 37°C.\nResuspend the plate with 10 mL of DMEM complete. Break up all cell clumps by pipetting the cells up and down 2–3 times at fast speed against the bottom of the plate.\nHarvest all plates into two T75 flasks, one per replicate.\nCount cells.\nSplit cells into different conditions. For each condition prepare a T75 flask (including one for the non-treated control; for example 3 drug conditions plus a non-treated control for two replicates would require 8 × T75 flasks).\nMix 36 × 106 cells in 240 mL of DMEM complete in each flask.\nAdd drug to each flask and mix thoroughly by inverting the flask.\nSeed 20 mL in each of the 12 plates for both replicates for each condition.",
    "Plate the cells by gently rocking the plates to evenly distribute the cells.\nIncubate the plates in the 37°C incubator.\nNote: At each timepoint it is possible to collect a cell pellet that will be processed for sequencing. However, for our dropout genotoxic CRISPR screen we routinely only collect and process the T0 and T18 samples.\nDay T9 to day T15. Conduct the following procedure every 3 days until T15 (or the timepoint prior to screen completion).\nAspirate media and wash with 10 mL warm PBS per plate.\nAdd 3 mL of trypsin per plate and gently rock the plates to get complete coverage of the cell layer.\nIncubate for 5 min at 37°C.\nResuspend cells with 10 mL of DMEM complete. Break up all cell clumps by pipetting the cells up and down 2–3 times at fast speed against the bottom of the plate.\nHarvest all plates into separate T75 flasks, one per replicate and per treatment.\nCount cells.\nPlate 12 plates (3 × 106 cells each) per replicate per each condition by gently rocking the plates to evenly distribute the cells.\nIncubate the plates in the 37°C incubator.\nDay T18. Collect final samples.\nAspirate media and wash with 10 mL warm PBS per plate.\nAdd 3 mL of trypsin to the plates and gently rock the plates to get complete coverage of the cell layer.\nIncubate for 5 min at 37°C.\nResuspend cells with 10 mL of DMEM complete.

    "Prepare sequencing cell pellets (each pellet should contain at least 28.4 × 106 cells to achieve the desired coverage of the library):\nPrepare 3–4 × 50 mL conical tubes with at least 28.436 × 106 cells per replicate and condition.\nCentrifuge tubes at 500 × g for 5 min using a centrifuge with swinging buckets.\nAspirate media, being careful not to disturb the cell pellet.\nResuspend the pellet with 10 mL of warm PBS.\nTransfer the resuspended cells in 15 mL tubes (1 tube per replicate and condition).\nSpin the cells down at 500 × g for 5 min using a centrifuge with swinging buckets.\nAspirate the PBS, being careful not to disturb the cell pellet.\nClose the tubes tightly and snap freeze them in liquid nitrogen for at least 2 min.\nStore pellets at −80°C until you are ready to perform genomic DNA extraction.\nNote: If you wish to have back up cell pellets for sequencing, it is possible to increase the number of plates seeded at T15 as a means to collect more cells at T18.\nGenomic DNA extraction and precipitation\nTiming: 1–2 days\nIn this step, the cell pellets stored at −80°C are processed to extract the genomic DNA. The resulting DNA is used to perform the PCR reactions needed to amplify the sgRNA cassette integrated into the genome and for incorporating the Illumina indexes.\nGenomic DNA extraction is performed using the QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi Kit and the QIAGEN Ribonuclease A (RNase A), according to the following protocol, adapted from the kit manual.\nBefore starting the DNA extraction and genomic precipitation:\nPrepare a 70°C water bath.\nPre-warm buffer AE to 65°C.\nEnsure that the area and equipment are thoroughly cleaned with 70% ethanol and 10% bleach solutions before commencing to process the samples.",
    "Make sure that only DNase/RNase-free serological pipettes, filtered tips, and tubes are used for the entire process of genomic extraction and PCR reactions.\nTo avoid cross contamination, all buffers in the QIAamp Blood Maxi kit should be aliquoted into sterile 50 mL conical tubes as a means to avoid repeated opening and closing of bottles.\nUse only ultra-pure ddH2O and PBS in every step of the protocol.\nUse only swinging bucket centrifuges, and ensure they are properly cleaned before using them.

    "Critical: before commencing PCRs, it is important to always include a control without genomic DNA to ensure the absence of contaminating template (for both PCR reactions). This is critical since lentiCRISPRv2 (and derivatives) are routinely used in labs and can be a source of contamination.\nCritical: Handling PCR reactions for multiple genomic DNA templates in a 96 well plate can potentially result in cross contamination. To avoid this, set up and aliquot the reactions for one template at a time, thoroughly cleaning the working surface before moving to the next template’s reaction.\nCritical: It is important to avoid the exponential phase of the PCR reaction. For this reason, use a low number of cycles (<20). Even if a band is barely visible, you can usually process to PCR-2 and should observe a clear band after the second PCR reaction.\nPCR-1 (outer primers): The role of PCR-1 is to amplify the integrated sgRNA cassette while maintaining the required coverage of the library. The PCR1 reaction is performed using 3 μg of DNA per reaction. For each sample are then prepared 35 reactions.\nUse the following primers:\nprimer forward V3_2_F: 5′-CTGCGTGCGCCAATTCTG-3′\nprimer reverse V3_1_R2: 5′-AGAACCGGTCCTGTGTTCTG-3′\nTo set up the PCR-1 reaction master mix:\nPrepare a 10 μM mix for both outer primers:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_461_2.csv\nSetup PCR #1 as follows in 96-well PCR plates:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_461_3.csv\nMix all the reagents in a 15 mL tube and keep the reaction on ice.\nAliquot 50 μL in each well of a 96-well plate.\nCarefully cover each PCR plate with adhesive plastic plate seals and centrifuge plates at 500 × g for 1 min to bring all liquid to the bottom of the plate.\nRun PCR in a 96-well compatible thermocycler using the following profile:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_461_4.csv",

    "Note: One of the possible problems performing PCR1 is the presence of a smear and/or the reduction of intensity of the specific band at 842 bp when running the reaction on agarose gel. This could be due to the presence of undigested RNA. If RNA is present in the PCR reaction, this may reduce the yield of each reaction. To avoid this problem, it is possible to undertake the RNase digestion step for 10 min instead of 5 min. In case the PCR-1 conditions need to be altered to improve the yield of this step, it is important to avoid increasing the number of PCR cycles, to avoid introducing bias toward particular guide RNA-coding sequences. It is recommended first to reduce the annealing temperature or extending the extension time before increasing the number of cycles.\nPCR-2 (Illumina adaptors): PCR-2 is important to add Illumina adaptors for sequencing and the i5 and i7 indexes used for multiplexing.\nCritical: before commencing PCR-2, Use only appropriate Illumina adaptors and i5 and i7 index primer combinations for each individual sample to allow pooling of sequencing libraries and multiplexed sequencing.\nCritical: The primers used in this protocol are suitable for using with Illumina NextSeq 550 Series (see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). To obtain good quality amplicons for sequencing, order HPLC-purified primers.\nCritical: See Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] for an example of a possible combination of indexes for sequencing.\nCritical: For each sample, prepare four reactions. This will allow you to recover enough material after the double purification of the PCR-2 products from the agarose gel.\nCritical: Dilute the original stocks of the primers to 10 μM being careful not to contaminate the original stock.\nTo set up the PCR-2 reaction master mix:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_461_5.csv\nSee Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for primer sequences.",

Follow the kit instructions.\nElute PCR product using 30 μL EB. Run the eluted material again through the column to elute as much PCR product as possible. This step is important to concentrate the PCR product in order to load the entire sample on 1–2 wells in the agarose gel.\nRun the entire 30 μL purified PCR product on a 2% agarose gel. The specific desired band is at 202–207 bp (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). If additional non-specific bands are visible in the gel, the bands must be resolved well enough to be able to excise the correct band.

Before submitting the samples there are a few things to consider:",
    "Using the high-throughput kit, one flow cell can sequence up to 400 million reads. To ensure correct coverage, each sample should be sequenced with at least 28.436 × 106 reads. Due to possible fluctuations of number of reads during the loading of the flow cell, usually 30 × 106 reads are assigned for each sample (see Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] for an example of read distributions). For this reason, one single flow cell can sequence up to 13 samples.\nTo ensure good quality of sequencing, it is possible to test the quality of the PCR-2 primers by performing a qPCR using the lentiviral maxiprep as template. Alternatively, you can test them directly using the material from PCR-1, since only 10 μL of the PCR-1 product will be used for PCR-2. However, we prefer to test each sample by performing a qPCR with the index primers before loading them in the flow cell. This step is important to evaluate the correct concentration of each sample and to assess whether the samples will perform adequately during sequencing.\nSequencing is performed by performing 22 dark cycles followed by 25 reads. Dark cycles are used to reduce errors during the sequencing caused by low variability in the identical sequence (U6 promoter) before the actual 20 bp sgRNA.\nTo reduce the probability of errors due to low variability, 6 staggered forward primers are used with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 staggered nucleotides. To compensate for the staggering, the read length is increased from 20 to 25 bp. See Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] for further details. This also allows you to reduce the amount of PhiX DNA to 1%.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/461-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Data presented as means ± SD; n = 3.\nThe Illumina recipe for the NextSeq Kit 2.5 used for sequencing can be found in the supplementary Mendeley Database (https://doi.org/10.17632/cx67bdkfrg.1[href=https://doi.org/10.17632/cx67bdkfrg.1]).\nTrimming\nAfter the sequencing, in order to remove the staggered nucleotides from the FASTQ files obtained from the sequencing, execute the script in the Mendeley database (https://doi.org/10.17632/cx67bdkfrg.1[href=https://doi.org/10.17632/cx67bdkfrg.1]) called Trimming_script.pl. To launch the script, use the following bash command on the terminal (example for D501_F primer forward):\nperl trRead.pl rawFastq/Sample_1_RZ_273_b3 trimmed/S1 0 5\nUsed the following values for each primer:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_461_8.csv\nFor an example of untrimmed and trimmed sequencing file, see Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_461_9.csv\nOnce all the FASTQ files are correctly trimmed according to the number of staggered oligos in the forward primer, fastq.gz files containing the same sample must be merged into a single file. For example:\nCRISPR_RPE_T18A_etoposide_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz.3.fastq.gz\nCRISPR_RPE_T18A_etoposide_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz.3.fastq.gz\nCRISPR_RPE_T18A_etoposide_L003_R1_001.fastq.gz.3.fastq.gz\nCRISPR_RPE_T18A_etoposide_L004_R1_001.fastq.gz.3.fastq.gz\nThese files must be merged into a single file called “CRISPR_RPE_T18A_etoposide_all_R1_001.fastq.gz.3.fastq.gz.” To do that, execute the following bash command:\ncat CRISPR_RPE_T18A_etoposide_L00∗_R1_001.fastq.gz.3.fastq.gz > CRISPR_RPE_T18A_etoposide_all_R1_001.fastq.gz.3.fastq.gz\nGenerate the read-count file using the MaGeCK function “count” (https://sourceforge.net/p/mageck/wiki/usage/#count[href=https://sourceforge.net/p/mageck/wiki/usage/#count]).\nmageck count -l /Users/tkoV3.csv --fastq\n/Users/CRISPR_RPE_T18A_etoposide_all_R1_001.fastq.gz.3.fastq.gz\n/Users/CRISPR_RPE_T18B_etoposide_all_R1_001.fastq.gz.3.fastq.gz\n/Users/CRISPR_RPE_T18A_notreated_all_R1_001.fastq.gz.3.fastq.gz\n/Users/CRISPR_RPE_T18B_notreated_all_R1_001.fastq.gz.3.fastq.gz\n/Users/CRISPR_RPE_T0_all_R1_001.fastq.gz.3.fastq.gz --sample-label Etoposide_T18A, Etoposide_T18B, NotTreated_T18A, NotTreated_T18B, T0 -n CRISPR_genotoxic_RPE --unmapped-to-file\n-l: library used.
