    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nExtraction of protein from cell lines\nTiming: 2 – 3 h\nStart with a mammalian cell line that reached confluency of around 80%. For this protocol, around 2.5 mg of total protein is needed per sample to be analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Growth kinetics, total protein concentration and appropriate amount of cell culture plates/flasks of the chosen cell line should be determined before the start of the experiment. For illustrative purpose, the cells are assumed to be harvested from 100 mm plates.\nCells are grown in plates/flasks to around 80% confluency in recommended cell culture medium. For our adherent cell lines, we use plates.\nCells are prepared for lysis.\nCulture medium is removed by aspiration and discarded.\nCells are washed with 10 mL ice-cold PBS.\nThe PBS used for washing is discarded.\n2 mL of ice-cold PBS is added to each 100 mm plate.\nCells are detached from the plate using a cell scraper.\nThe cell suspension in PBS is transferred to a conical centrifuge tube with a pipette.\nCentrifuge the sample for 10 min at 4°C at 1,000×g.\nThe supernatant is discarded, and the cell pellet is used to obtain protein lysates in the following steps.\nThe soluble protein lysate is isolated.\nThe cell pellet is lysed by adding an amount of lysis buffer that is 3 times the pellet size (v/v).\nNote: Tris-based buffer may be used as well, instead of HEPES-based one, that we used.\nThe cell pellet is disrupted using lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 30 min in Eppendorf tubes.\nThe lysate is centrifuged for 15 min at 4°C at 16,000×g.\nThe supernatant containing the soluble protein extract is transferred to a new Eppendorf tube.",
    "The protein concentration is determined using BCA Protein Assay kit. Using this kit, only 1 μL of a sample is needed for the protein concentration measurement.\nAliquots containing 2.5 mg of protein in Eppendorf tubes are made and are stored at −80°C until use.\nGeneration of beads and antibody coupling\nTiming: 24 h\nThe commercially available Dynabeads® Antibody Coupling Kit, which contains 2.8 μm magnetic M-270 Epoxy beads, was used for antibody coupling. All the reagents (C1, C2, HB, LB, SB) are provided in the kit. All the tubes used were 1.5-mL Eppendorf tubes.\nFor each sample, 3 mg of Dynabeads® M-270 Epoxy beads are weighed and transferred into a microcentrifuge tube.\nNote: This amount of beads was optimized for our mass spectrometry experiments to efficiently immunoprecipitate the bait protein with minimum background interference.\nTo begin washing the beads, 1 mL of C1 is added and slowly pipetted up and down.\nThe tubes containing the Dynabeads are placed inside of the tube rack with magnets for 1 min to allow the beads to accumulate.\nThe supernatant is removed and discarded.\nNote: Care should be taken to not disturb the accumulated beads. We use gel loading tips for the supernatant removal. This is to avoid accidentally removing the beads during this process.\nThe tubes containing the Dynabeads are removed from the magnetic rack.\n50 μg of the antibody (Ab) specific for the protein of interest (the bait protein) is added to the tube containing the Dynabeads.\nIn a separate tube, 50 μg of normal IgG is added, which acts as a negative control.",
    "Note: For protein-protein interaction analysis, it is crucial to prepare a negative control, such as normal IgG, to help identify adventitious proteins so that false-positive interactions can be annotated. The IgG control should be sourced from the same species as the Ab used for the protein of interest.\nThe appropriate volume of C1 is added to each of the tubes (from steps 10 and 11) to reach a final volume of 150 μL.\n150 μL of C2 is added to each of the tubes.\nThe tubes are then incubated at 37°C for around 18 h on an orbital rotator.\nCritical: The volume of mix Ab + C1 + C2 should be 300 μL for 3 mg of beads, to mix efficiently. The appropriate volumes of antibodies used in these steps is dependent upon the concentration of the antibody supplied by the vendor, which can vary widely. If the antibody is dilute and a larger volume is required, start with more beads at step 5 in order to achieve the proper ratio for incubation.\nNote: Make sure the beads are mixing well, as they can settle at the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube. Use a higher rotation speed for the first 30 min, if possible, and then incubate around 18 h with gentle rotation.\nThe tubes are placed on a magnet for 1 min and the supernatants are carefully removed and discarded.\nAfter removing the tubes from the magnet, the beads are washed by adding 800 μL of solution HB and gently pipetting up and down gently at least 10 times.\nThe tubes are placed on a magnet for 1 min and the supernatants are carefully removed and discarded.",
    "After removing the tubes from the magnetic rack, the beads are washed by adding 800 μL of solution LB and gently pipetting up and down gently at least 10 times.\nThe tubes are placed on a magnet for 1 min and the supernatants are carefully removed and discarded.\nAfter removing the tubes from the magnet, the beads are washed by adding 800 μL of solution SB and gently pipetting up and down gently at least 10 times.\nThe tubes are placed on a magnet for 1 min and the supernatants are carefully removed and discarded.\nRepeat steps 20 and 21.\n800 μL of SB is added to the beads and incubated on orbital rotator for 15 min at 25°C.\nThe tubes are placed on a magnet for 1 min and the supernatants are carefully removed and discarded.\nAfter removing the tubes from the magnet, 800 μL of PBS + BSA is added to the beads.\nThe slurry is gently mixed using a rotator for 5 min at 25°C.\nThe tubes are placed on a magnet for 1 min and the supernatants are carefully removed and discarded.\nThe tubes containing the antibody conjugated beads are placed on ice and used immediately in the following steps.\nNote: The beads are now covalently coupled with Ab.\nCo-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)\nTiming: 24 h\nAt this stage, the cell lysates are incubated with the covalently coupled beads to enrich the bait protein and its interactors (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1489-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Overview of the bait protein enrichment workflow prior to mass spectrometry analysis\nThe Coomassie-stained gel was visualized using an Odyssey Fc system, using 700 nm channel and green color, for better visualization.",
    "The cell lysate containing 2.5 mg of the total proteins (from step 5, defrosted) is added to the antibody-coupled beads in the Eppendorf tube from step 28.\nThe samples are incubated for 18–24 h with orbital rotation, at 4°C.\nThe tubes are placed on a magnet for 1 min and the supernatants are carefully removed and discarded.\nAfter removing the tubes from the magnet, BW-A buffer is added to the beads and gently pipetted up and down at least 10 times.\nThe tubes are placed on a magnet for 1 min and the supernatants are carefully removed and discarded.\nSteps 32 and 33 are repeated an additional 3 times.\nAfter removing the tube from the magnet, BW-B buffer is added.\nThe samples are placed on an orbital rotator for 5 min at 25°C.\nThe tubes are placed on a magnet for 1 min and the supernatants are carefully removed and discarded.\n500 μL of an SE buffer is added to the beads.\nThe samples are placed on an orbital rotator and incubated for 10 min at 25°C to elute the proteins from the antibody-conjugated beads.\nNote: The elution with a high pH buffer does not disrupt the antibody attached to the beads, which avoids problems associated with the heavy and light IgG chains interfering with the results. A high abundance of IgG in the sample can impair the mass spectrometry detection of peptides/proteins that interact with the bait protein. As an alternative to the high-pH elution buffer, a low-pH elution buffer may be used instead. For example, a glycine-HCl buffer can be used, however we didn’t test it in our protocol.\nThe supernatants (which will be around 500 μL) are collected and transferred to new Eppendorf tubes.\nThe samples are then concentrated using a SpeedVac to volume around 50 μL.",
    "The pH of the sample should be checked with a pH strip and neutralized with acetic acid, if necessary.\nPause point: The samples can be stored at −80°C until further use.\nCritical: Before moving to the mass spectrometry step, we strongly advise to confirm first that the Co-IP was successful using Western blot (use 5 μL or less, out of 50 μL of the total immunoprecipitate, depending on the quality of the antibodies). The band corresponding to the bait protein should be visible only in the immunoprecipitate from the Ab-conjugated beads, and not in the negative IgG controls. If the bait protein is identified by western, an additional blot for known interacting proteins can also act as additional validation the Co-IP steps are appropriate.\nSample preparation for LC-MS/MS\nTiming: 2 days\nAt this stage, the bait protein and its interacting protein partners are being separated on a gel, digested to peptides, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Alternatively, an in-solution digestion protocol can be used instead of this in-gel digestion protocol. In-gel digestion protocol might be useful here, however, as it allows protein visualization before further steps and can reveal if the previous Co-IP was successful or not. The in-gel digestion method remains as an efficient and reproducible method for this type of analysis. 1.5-mL Eppendorf tubes are used throughout the steps, as they are very compatible with mass spectrometry (low leaching effect).\n40 μL of the protein immunoprecipitate from step 42 is mixed with 10 μL of XT Sample Buffer (with added XT Reducing Agent).\nNote: We used commercially available premixed loading buffer, compatible with our gel-separating system and buffers.\nThe samples are incubated for 7 min at 95°C using a ThermoMixer.\nNote: All incubation steps on ThermoMixer were conducted at 800 rpm.",
    "45–50 μL of the samples are loaded on a 10% Criterion XT Bis-Tris gel, and the electrophoresis is stopped when the dye front moves around 2 inches from the base of the well.\nNote: We recommend leaving free lanes between samples to avoid potential cross-contamination that can occur if the wells are overloaded.\nThe gel is washed with water after removing it from its plates.\nCoomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 is used to stain the gel for 2 h.\nThe gel is destained for around 18–24 h.\nNote: To save time, instead of Coomassie staining, use InstantBlue Stain Solution. This allows gel staining/destaining to be completed in less than 20 min. Avoid traditional silver staining, as it might cause chemical crosslinking of the proteins. There are some commercially available MS-compatible silver stains.\nCut out the 2-inch lane into 3 or more slices with a disposable scalpel, and transfer into a 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube.\nNote: When reusing the scalpel for cutting multiple gel slices from different samples, take care to thoroughly wash it with water, then methanol, then water again, between each slice excision to reduce cross-contamination.\nCritical: As a rule of thumb, the more gel slices that are cut out from a single lane, the more proteins will be detected by MS/MS. Ideally, the gel slices should be around 5 mm, and not more than 10 mm in size.\nPause point: You can stop here, and store gel cuts in clean Eppendorf tubes at −20°C or continue. Gel slices stored in a freezer are stable for several months. It is recommended to cover the gel slices with water before freezing, but it is not necessary.\n100 μL of HPLC-grade water is added to each tube containing a gel slice.\nThe tubes are agitated on the ThermoMixer for 10 min.",
    "The supernatant is removed and discarded.\n100 μL of (ACN) is added to the gel slices and incubated for 5–10 min.\nThe supernatant is removed and discarded.\nNote: If gel pieces are still blue at the end of step 54, another 100 μL of ACN is added, and shaking is continued for another 15 min or until the blue stain is removed from the gel slice.\nFor each gel slice, 100 μL of TCEP reduction solution is made by combining 10 μL of 20 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) with 90 μL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (AmBic).\n100 μL of the TCEP solution is added to each gel slice.\nThe tubes are incubated at 37°C for 30 min on the ThermoMixer.\nNote: DTT may be used instead of TCEP.\n100 μL of ACN is added to each tube.\nThe tubes are agitated on the ThermoMixer for 15 min at 25°C.\nThe supernatant is removed and discarded.\n100 μL of ACN is added to each tube.\nThe tubes are agitated on the ThermoMixer for 5 min at 25°C.\nThe supernatant is removed and discarded.\nFor each gel slice, IAA alkylation solution is made by combining 10 μL of 375 mM IAA with 90 μL of 50 mM AmBic.\n100 μL of IAA solution is added to each gel slice.\nThe samples are incubated for 20 min at 25°C in the dark.\nThe supernatant is removed and discarded.\n100 μL of ACN is added to each gel slice and incubated for 10 min.\nThe supernatant is removed and discarded.\nThe gel slices are allowed to air-dry for 10 min before proceeding.\nA solution of 15 ng/μL trypsin is added in an amount to cover gel slices (usually between 20-50 μL).\nThe samples are incubated on ice for 30 min.",
    "Any excess trypsin solution is removed and discarded.\n100 μL of 25 mM AmBic is added to each gel slice.\nIncubate the samples for around 18 h at 37°C.\nNote: The 25 mM AmBic solution should cover the gel slice completely. After 15 min, check to ensure that the AmBic still covers the gel slices. More AmBic can be added if necessary.\nFresh peptide extraction buffer (PXB) is prepared.\nNew Eppendorf tubes are washed with 100 μL of PXB and labeled.\nTransfer extracts obtained in the following steps to these PXB washed and labeled tubes.\n100 μL of PXB is added to each gel slice.\nSamples are incubated in PXB for 15 min at 25°C to extract the trypsin digested peptides.\nExtracted peptides in PXB are transferred to the appropriately labeled tubes from step 77.\nSteps 79–81 are repeated, and the 2 extraction fractions for each gel slice are collected in the same tube.\nSamples are then completely dried using the SpeedVac.\nNote: The time for samples to dry the samples is variable depending upon the volume of the sample and the capabilities of the speed-vac instrument. We normally need around 2 h to dry our samples.\nThe dried peptide pellet is resuspended in 100 μL of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water.\nPurification of peptides to remove salts and detergents is performed using Pierce C18 tips (100 μL bed).\nNote: C18 tips are ready-to-use pipette tips that capture and concentrate peptides from the sample and remove salts and detergents. Instead of tips, other commercially available C18 cleaning spin columns can be used as well. The tips we used in our protocol have the capacity to bind 80 μg of peptides. We used the User Guide provided by the manufacturer to conduct this step.",
    "After peptide purification is complete, the samples are dried with SpeedVac.\nPause point: At this point, dried peptides can be stored at −80°C for up to several months.\nThe peptide pellet is resuspended with 0.1% formic acid (FA) in water, so that the final concentration of the peptides is around 500 ng/μL (check concentration with nanodrop).\nNow, the samples are ready to be submitted for LC-MS/MS analysis.\nLC-MS/MS\nTiming: days to a week\nLiquid chromatography is used to separate the isolated peptides prior to MS acquisition.\nAround 1 μg of the peptides are injected into the UltiMate 3000 UHPLC system equipped with C18 analytical LC column (2 μm, 100 Å, 75 μm i.d. × 50 cm, nanoViper, Thermo Scientific), directly connected to Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific).\nAfter injection, peptides are loaded onto a trap C18 column and washed with Mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid in water), at a flow rate of 4 μL/min.\nPeptides are separated on the analytical C18 column using a step gradient of 4%–25% Mobile phase B (80% ACN/19.9% water/0.1% formic acid) from 10-100 min, and 25%–45% Mobile phase B from 100-130 min, at the flow rate of 300 nL/min, and 50°C.\nEluted peptides are then analyzed by high-resolution mass spectrometry, in data-dependent acquisition mode (DDA).\nA survey full scan MS is set for acquiring in the Orbitrap mode, for a scan range from m/z 350 to 1800, at a resolution of 120,000.\nThe automatic gain control (AGC) target for MS1 is set to 4 × 105, with an ion filling time of 100 ms.\nThe most intense parent ions with charge states of 2–6 are selected to be isolated in 3 s cycles.\nParent ions are fragmented using higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) with 35% normalized collision energy.",
    "Fragmented ions are detected at a mass resolution of 30,000 at 200 m/z.\nThe AGC target for MS2 is set to 5 × 104, with an ion filling time of 60 ms. Dynamic exclusion is set for 30 s with a 10-ppm mass window.\nNote: Other nanoLC and high-resolution mass spectrometer systems with similar capabilities may be used. If the experiment is done in triplicate for each sample, a label-free quantitation workflow can be incorporated into the analysis with software such as Proteome Discoverer. Consult the vendor’s manual for detailed instruction. There are also algorithms such as Significance Analysis of INTeractome (SAINT; http://saint-apms.sourceforge.net/Main.html[href=http://saint-apms.sourceforge.net/Main.html]) that can differentiate the bona fide interactors from the adventitious non-specific proteins. Consult the developer’s website for installation and analysis guidelines. We recommend that these experiments be performed in duplicate or triplicate biological replicates to confirm the reproducibility of the results. In addition, validation with orthogonal experimental methods such as co-IP of the identified prey followed by detection by western blot of the original bait or yeast/mammalian two-hybrid systems are important to confirm individual interactions."
