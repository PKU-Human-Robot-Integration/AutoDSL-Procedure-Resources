    "The techniques used in the following protocol have been approved by the West London Research Ethics Committee (Reference number 15/lO/0444).\n1. Nasal Absorption (NA)\nPreparation prior to NA sampling\nWhen carrying out NA, first wash hands and put on gloves, preferably in front of the patient.\nInspect the nasal cavity using a head torch, and have the clinician use their non-dominant thumb to retract the patient's nose to visualize the nasal cavity.\nNote: A nasal speculum is not usually required.\nVisualize the nasal cavity and inferior turbinate prior to sampling.\nNote: The nares (nostrils) are not round in cross-section and they go straight backwards. Generally, the inferior turbinate can be seen as a bulge or indentation on the lateral wall of the nostril, with the nasal septum forming the smooth, flat medial wall. We want to sample from this inferior turbinate, since the underlying epithelium is a simple ciliated epithelium of the respiratory tract44.\nNA sampling\nWhen sampling, pass the NA SAM gently up the lumen of the nostril, orientating it to be flat against the inferior turbinate.\nAsk the donor to use an index finger to press the SAM onto the nasal mucosa. NA can cause a slight tickling, with possible eye watering, as the MLF is absorbed.\nNote: In adults, we generally perform NA for 60 s.\nAfter absorption of MLF, remove the NA device from the nostril and put back into the original tube.\nProcess the samples immediately in the laboratory or freeze them, as detailed later in this protocol.\nNote: NA is being studied in a variety of nasal mucosal challenge models, and also in different airways diseases. However, validation against other respiratory sampling methods should be performed for each study and patient population.\n2. Bronchial Absorption (BA)\nPreparation prior to BA sampling",
    "Note: BA is performed by specialized personnel in a bronchoscopy suite.\n\t\nBefore placing the BA device down the catheter, check that the SAM is extruding and withdrawing back into the catheter.\nPrior to conducting BA on a patient, conduct a mock BA on a bronchoscopy simulator.\nBA sampling\nPass the bronchoscope down the trachea and right main bronchus to the level of the bronchus intermedius, just proximal to the division into the right lower and right middle lobes.\n\t\tNOTE: We typically sample from the bronchus intermedius, though other sites within the airway can be sampled. When observing the catheter and SAM, one cannot see the bronchoscope tip. We observe the following simple steps for BA, once the bronchoscope has reached the desired sampling site.\nCATHETER DOWN: Insert the BA catheter through the operating channel of the bronchoscope until the white tip is just visible in the airway, to a maximum of 1 cm distal to the end of the bronchoscope. Keep the bronchoscope and catheter tip in the center of the lumen of the airway. Be careful to minimize contact between the catheter tip and the bronchial mucosa to reduce the risk of abrasion to the mucosa.\nSAM OUT: Depress the handle of the BA device so that the SAM is extruded into the lumen of the right middle or right lower lobe airway. Under direct vision, bend the tip of the bronchoscope to ensure that the SAM is making contact with the MLF on the airway wall. Leave the SAM within the airway, flat to the mucosal wall for 30 s.",
    "SAM IN: Look through the bronchoscope to ensure that the moist SAM probe is straight and not bent back over the end of the catheter. If required, the catheter and bronchoscope tip can be brought back to straighten the SAM. Under direct vision, retract the straight SAM gently back into the catheter.\n\t\tNOTE: If there is difficulty retracting the SAM back into the catheter, withdraw the whole device with SAM extruded back out of the airway.\nCATHETER UP: Withdraw the entire catheter from the operating channel of the bronchoscope.\nCUT OFF SAM: The SAM is cut off with sterile scissors and is then put into a cryotube on ice. These samples can be processed with varying methods, as detailed later in this protocol.\n3. Processing of NA and BA Samples\nNote: There are numerous options for laboratory processing of samples resulting from NA and BA. These protocols seek to store samples for later use, and to elute the MLF sample from the SAM.\nOptions for immediate handling of NA and BA samples\nOption 1: Store the moist SAM on ice for a few hours prior to further processing.\nOption 2: Immediately deep freeze NA SAMs in the collection tube. Similarly, freeze BA SAMs in cryogenic vials after removal, with scissors, from the sampling device.\nOption 3: Place the detached SAM in elution buffer (300 µL) prior to processing directly or deep freezing.\nOptions of elution buffer for NA and BA samples\nNote: The choice of elution buffer depends on what is going to be analyzed in the MLF sample and we suggest four main alternatives:\n\t\nUse a pre-prepared assay buffer suitable for immunoassay procedures. Such buffers should contain a small amount of detergent (0.05%) as well as protein, e.g., bovine serum albumin (BSA) at 1%.",
    "Alternatively, use a buffer containing a greater amount of detergent, so that cell lysis occurs.\nNote: We use buffers containing Triton-X or NP40 at 1% concentration. Cell lysis buffers enable both intracellular and extracellular cytokines to be eluted from the SAM, and generally result in higher levels of cytokines and chemokines. These buffers should also contain protein, and are made up with BSA to 1%.\nFor RNA measurements, such as quantitative PCR of viral RNA or measuring host RNA, add RNA extraction buffer directly to the moist SAM.\nNote: Chaotropic RNA extraction buffers contain guanidinium that denatures proteins. An alternative is to add RNA extraction buffer to the eluted MLF fluid contained in immunoassay or cell lysis buffer.\nUse organic solvents, such as trifluoroacetic acid, for extraction of lipids and metabolites, for evaluation by mass-spectrometry.\nNote: Details of all these reagents are included in the Materials section.\nElution technique\nFor any of the above elution techniques, insert the SAM into a 2 mL micro-centrifuge tube, along with the desired extraction buffer.\nVortex mix the sample for 30 s to wash the SAM of loosely attached fluids and biomolecules.\nTo ensure full sample recovery, perform centrifugal elution by adding the moist SAM to a spin filter mini-column that inserts into the same 2 mL micro-centrifuge tube used for washing.\nNote: Two types of spin filter mini-column can be used. The first contains only a plastic mesh, which holds the SAM in place, allowing full elution of fluids. Alternatively, if working with infectious materials, use spin filters with a 0.22 µm pore size. These filters will sterilize samples and are suitable for samples with suspected Mycobacterial infection. However, these filters should be pre-incubated with buffer, to minimize binding of mediators to the filter by non-specific interactions.",
    "Use sterilized forceps to transfer the moist SAM to the spin filter. Change forceps between samples to prevent contamination.\nCentrifuge samples for 20 min at 16,000 x g in a mini-centrifuge cooled to 4 °C.\nSummary example protocol\nIn the laboratory, label 2 mL micro-centrifuge tubes for sample collection and add the desired volume of elution buffer (typically 300 µL for NA; 100 µL for BA). Seal lid and place on ice.\nFollowing sampling (either immediately or in the lab) the SAM is removed from the handle using forceps and placed into the buffer containing collection tube (produced in previous step). Ensure the cap of the microcentrifuge tube is closed securely and transfer the samples, on ice, to the laboratory for further processing.\nRemove tubes containing SAM and elution buffer from their transfer container and vortex mix for 30 s.\nUsing sterile forceps, remove SAM and place into a spin column (with or without 0.22 µm cellulose acetate filter).\nCollect the elution buffer from the collection tube and retain.\nPlace the spin column, with SAM, in the original collection tube (or a new one if sterile-filtering samples) and add collection buffer to spin column. In this manner, the wash fluid will pass through the spin column back into the collection tube, helping to elute the sample from the SAM.\nCentrifuge the samples with lids sealed (16,000 x g, 20 min, 4 °C).\nRemove the samples from the centrifuge and place into a rack.\nOpen the sealed lid of the tubes and remove the spin column containing the SAM. Dispose of SAM and spin column in an appropriate waste container.\nCarefully aliquot the eluate contained within the tube into labelled cryogenic tubes. Record the total volume of eluate and the volume in each aliquot.",
    "Transfer the sealed cryogenic tubes to a -80°C freezer and store upright until use."
