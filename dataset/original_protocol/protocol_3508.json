Cynomolgus macaque testis dissection\n(A) Image of an adult cynomolgus macaque testis.\n(B) Detachment of the epididymis from the testis.\n(C) Small incision of the tunica albuginea.\n(D) Dissection of tunica albuginea and separation of the seminiferous tubules from the tunica albuginea.\n(E) Segmentation of testis tubule tissue into 1–2 g pieces.\nRemove the outer layers, e.g., skin and loose connective tissue.\nDetach the epididymis.\nWeigh the testis.\nRemove the tunica albuginea.\nMake a small incision of the tunica albuginea.\nDissect under it to create a dissection plane, separating the seminiferous tubules underneath from the tunica.\nCut the testis tubules into 1 - 2 g pieces, and further cut each piece into smaller pieces to facilitate subsequent digestion.\nDissociation of testis samples\nTiming: 1 h\nThe subsequent steps are performed to obtain a single-cell suspension of unselected cells from seminiferous tubules using enzymatic digestion.\nSubmerge testis tubule pieces in 25 mL of Tissue Digest Buffer A and leave the samples to digest at 37°C in a water bath for 5 min.\nShake the tube vigorously every 2 min until loosened tubules become visible.\nRemove and discard the supernatant.\nOptional: Cells in the supernatant, i.e., primarily interstitial cells, may also be kept and processed separately if this is of interest.\nAdd 25 mL of Tissue Digest Buffer B and allow the digest to occur for 30 min at 37°C in a water bath.\nShake the tube vigorously every 2 min until dissociation of the tubules into a single-cell suspension of cells.",
    "Add 2.5 mL of FBS to stop digestion.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 25 mL of PBS\nRepeat steps 9 and 10.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in a desired volume of PBS.\nFilter the cell suspension through a 40 μm cell strainer into a fresh tube.\nCount the cells to determine cell concentration.\nSample preparation for spermatocyte fluorescence-activated cell sorting\nTiming: 45 min\nSteps 16–20 describe live cells staining with the Hoechst 33342.\nAliquot the appropriate number of cells into four tubes.\nUnstained control: 1 × 106 cells\nPI only control: 1 × 106 cells\nHoechst 33342 only control: 1 × 106 cells\nPI + Hoechst 33342 sample: 5 × 106 to 1 × 107 cells\nNote: Tubes a - c serve as single stained controls used for gating and assessing fluorescence spectral overlap purposes. Assessment of the spectrum of spermatogenic cells can then be gated and analyzed using Tube d.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 200 × g for 10 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the matching cell pellet tube with 1 mL of prepared stain solution.\nIncubate tubes at 37°C for 30 min in the dark. Agitate tubes every 10 min to resuspend cells thus ensuring uniform staining.\nNote: Incubation with Hoechst 33342 stain has to be performed for at least 30 min at 37°C for optimal resolution.\nTubes are kept on ice, protected from light and filtered using a 40μm cell strainer prior to analysis.\nSample preparation for spermatogonia fluorescence-activated cell sorting\nTiming: 45 min\nSteps 21–28 describe live cell staining with SSEA-4 APC-conjugated antibody for the isolation of spermatogonia.",
    "Aliquot the appropriate number of cells into three tubes.\nUnstained control: 1 × 106 cells\nPI only control: 1 × 106 cells\nPI + SSEA-4 APC-conjugated Ab sample: 1 × 107 cells\nNote: Tubes a and b serve as single stained controls used for gating and assessing fluorescence spectral overlap purposes. Tube c contains all fluorochromes of interest involved in the cell sorting assay.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 200 × g for 10 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the matching cell pellet tube with 1 mL of prepared SSEA-4 APC-conjugated Ab stain solution. Incubate tubes at 37°C for 30 min in the dark.

Draw a “Scatter” gate to include cells of interest while excluding debris.\nOn the FSC-A versus FSC-H contour plot (linear scale), create a sub-gate under the “Scatter” gate to encompass single cells. This step helps to omit doublets which could otherwise contaminate purity of the sorted cells.",
    "Next, gate on PI negative live cells under the Singlets Gate using a PI-A (log scale) versus FSC-A (linear scale) contour.\nDisplay all live viable events on a DNA histogram with Hoechst blue on the x axis and count on the y axis. Low Hoechst blue intensity events are excluded to omit debris and unstained cells. Draw a “DNA” gate to only include cells containing DNA content of 1C and greater. Data are collected in linear scale.\nView gated “DNA” events on the Hoechst red-A/Hoechst blue-A contour plot (linear scale). A spectrum of cells in varying stages of spermatogenesis can be identified and gated based on their DNA content and Hoechst red/Hoechst blue fluorescence profile (please refer to Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F for more details on the profile obtained).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/428-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

These gates represent cell populations that are enriched in primary spermatocytes at pre-leptotene, leptotene/zygotene, early pachytene, late pachytene meiotic stages respectively (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).",
    "Note: PI is a nucleic acid stain that enters dead cells with disrupted cell membranes, and is excluded from live ones with intact membranes. The live cell dye Hoechst 33342 on the other hand is able to enter cells through diffusion and binds to the nucleic acid residues on the minor groove of DNA. Hoechst allows the detection variation in DNA content and chromatin, and in meiotic cells Hoechst red/blue fluorescence can be used to discriminate subpopulation of cells undergoing meiosis I (Bastos et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). Similarly, in this protocol, PI is used to reliably discriminate live cells (i.e., intact PI negative cells) versus non-viable (PI positive) cells, and Hoechst fluorescence is used to discriminate on the DNA content of meiotic cells.\nNote: Similar Hoechst 33342 staining profiles can be obtained using different brands of flow cytometers equipped with the laser lines described above. Filter configurations can differ between different systems.\nFlow cytometry analysis and fluorescence-activated cell sorting for primary spermatocytes\nTiming: 40 min\nIn this section, testis cells are sorted according to their Hoechst blue/Hoechst red fluorescence. Gated primary spermatocytes at various meiotic prophase I sub-stages are collected from the sort.\nUsing the gating template created above, acquire samples and optimize photomultiplier tube (PMT) voltages using the single stain controls in the following sequence (unstained, PI only, Hoechst 33342 only).\nNote: This step ensures that signals captured are on scale and also allows us to access fluorochrome interactions with one another (spectral overlap).\nUnstained tube\nSets baseline voltages for the sample.\nDetermines the level of autofluorescence in the sample without adding any fluorochromes (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nSelect and gate for singlets (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).

The shift in Hoechst red and Hoechst blue corresponds to the meiotic progression of primary spermatocytes, which allows for the discrimination of sub-stages of meiotic prophase I.\nGate 4N primary spermatocytes, based on their distinct sub-stages, following the contours of the cell density.\nProgram to collect and sort cells.\nSort cells using a low flow rate with 70 μm nozzle at 70 psi. Maintain event rate around 2,000–3,500 events/s.\nNote: High flow rates can increase the speed of cell sorting but compromise sort purity of the isolated fractions.\nMaintain a minimum of >80% sort efficiency during the sort. Monitor discard rate throughout to ensure that is it preferably not >200 events/s.\nCollect sorted cells in round bottom FACS tubes pre-loaded with collection media.",
    "Note: It is important to pre-coat the interior of collection tubes with collection media as this reduces the chances of sorted cells sticking to the interior of the tube during collection. 10% FBS in collection media enhances the survival of sorted fractions.\nTo store cells, centrifuge to pellet collected cells at 200 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend cells in Freezing Media to a concentration of 1000 cells/μL.\nAliquot 100–200 μL of cell suspension in cryovials and store at −80°C.\nGating strategy for isolating spermatogonia\nTiming: 20 min\nSteps 43–46 describe the gating strategy to use on the BD FACS Diva software for isolation of SSEA-4 positive spermatogonia.\nCreate an FSC-A versus SSC-A contour plot (linear scale).
