    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nNote: If using Cas9, follow steps 1–8; if using Cas12a, follow steps 9–16.\nGenome editing using Cas9 nuclease\nTiming: 30 min\nAdd components of the injection mixture to the tube containing Cas9 in the following order:\nPrepare Cas9 – 0.5 μL of 10 μg/μL stock (30 pmol)\nAdd tracrRNA – 5 μL of 0.4 μg/μL stock (90 pmol)\nAdd crRNA – 2.8 μL of 0.4 μg/μL stock (95 pmol) (if two guides are needed add 1.4 μL of each)\nPipette the mixture gently several times and incubate at 37°C for 15 min.\nAdd ssODN donor – 2.2 μL of 1 μg/μL stock (or)\nAdd melted dsDNA – 500 ng (final concentration: 25 ng/μL for ∼1 kb donors or 45 fmol/μL)\nAdd PRF4::rol-6 (su1006) plasmid – 1.6 μL of 500 ng/μL solution\nAdd nuclease free water to bring the final volume to 20 μL and pipette gently several times.\nTo avoid needle clogging, centrifuge the mixture 13000 x g for 2 min, transfer about 17 μL of the mixture to a fresh tube and keep the tube on ice; proceed to loading the needles.\nGenome editing using Cas12a nuclease\nTiming: 30 min\nAdd components of the injection mixture to the tube containing Cas12a in the following sequence:\nCas12a – 0.5 μL of 10 μg/μL stock (32 pmol)\nAdd Cas12a-crRNA – 2.5 μL of 40 μM stock (100 pmol)\nAdd TE pH 7.5– 3.0 μL\nPipette the mixture gently several times and incubate at 37°C for 15 min\nAdd ssODN donor – 2.2 μL of 1 μg/μL stock (or)\nAdd melted dsDNA – 500 ng (final concentration: 25 ng/μL for ∼1 kb donors or 45 fmol/μL)\nAdd PRF4::rol-6 (su1006) plasmid – 1.6 μL of 500 ng/μL stock",
    "Add nuclease free water to bring the final volume to 20 μL and pipette gently several times.\nTo avoid needle clogging, centrifuge the mixture at 13000 x g for 2 min, transfer about 17 μL of the mixture to a fresh tube and keep the tube on ice; proceed to loading the needles.\nNote:\nInjection mixtures can be prepared at room temperature.\n1:3 molar ratio of nuclease to guide RNA is used to saturate the nuclease. We have not explored the cutting efficiencies with other molar ratios.\nProtein aggregation or precipitation is not an issue at these RNP concentrations.\nTE is added in step 11 of Cas12a mixtures for easier pipetting. This step can be omitted by further reducing the concentration of crRNA stock.\nAlthough we haven’t explored the optimal dose range for ssODNs, given the efficiencies obtained with dsDNA at 25 ng/μL, much lower doses of ssODN could be used (Paix et al., 2017[href=https://star-protocols.cell.com/groups/7/protocols/973/versions/bib15]).\nFinal injection mixture can be stored at 4°C and re-used for more than a year without compromising efficiencies. We have injected 16 months old mixes and confirmed that HDR efficiencies are high.\nIn our experience adding any double stranded DNA before RNP complex formation reduces HDR efficiency.\nLoading needles and preparing the microscope\nTiming: 15 min\nUsing microloader tips, load 1.5 μL of the injection mixture into an etched needle.\nLeave the needle pointing tip downward for several minutes to allow air bubbles to work their way out of the tip. This can be done easily by sticking the needle to double sided tape or clay on a vertical surface.",
    "Before mounting your needle onto the micro-manipulator make sure to align and adjust the microscope. To do this place a worm on an injection pad under halocarbon oil. Bring the worm into focus under the 10× objective, then close down the condenser iris and make sure the shadow of the iris is centered in the field of view and sharply in focus. Also adjust the Nomarski optics and ensure that you have the proper filters and polarizers in the light path. Consult your manual for appropriate steps to focus the condenser and adjust the microscope. These adjustments are essential and must be done properly or the injections will be difficult if not impossible.\nInsert the needle into the tube connected to the pressure regulator and lock it in place on the needle holder, then position the holder downward (∼15°) relative to the stage. Position the needle using the Z-axis adjustment such that it doesn’t touch the injection pad or the condenser when the microscope head is lowered.",
    "With the light on and the condenser iris closed down partially, position the needle using the coarse lateral adjustments so that the needle tip is illuminated in the center of the light. If your manipulator is mounted to the condenser arm, these adjustments can be made while the arm is tilted back away from the stage. Do not look through the eyepiece when making these coarse adjustments. Instead, look directly at the needle tip as you move the lateral and longitudinal adjustments on the manipulator. First, with the needle tip pushed past the center of the light path, move it forward or backward with the coarse adjustments until it is illuminated. You will see a spark of light when the needle is in the light path (close down the condenser iris to further pinpoint the needle, via this spark of light, in the center of the field of view). Next, move the needle laterally (to the right if using a right-handed system) until the spark of light disappears, and then move it back toward the left until it lights again. Now raise the needle up close to the condenser to ensure ample working distance when you lower the condenser arm. Assuming you successfully aligned your microscope light source as described in step 19 above, your needle tip is now in the center of the field of view and will only need to be lowered in order to bring it into focus when needed.\nUsing the worm loaded earlier as a reference, focus on the worm using the 10× objective and then while watching the needle directly (not through the eyepiece) use the Z-axis adjustment to lower the needle until it touches the oil above the worm.",
    "Look through the eyepiece and slowly center and bring the tip of needle into focus using X-, Y- and Z-axis adjustments on the micromanipulator. Once the tip is in focus, do not change the positions of X- or Y- axis.\nUsing 40× objective, examine the needle tip and apply pressure continuously for one or two seconds. One can judge the size of the opening (hence the quality of the needle) based on the diameter of the bubble produced in this interval. The bubble should be about the diameter of the gonad after one second. Adjust the pressure to the needle as needed. Pressures in the range of 40 to 80 psi are typically used during injection.\nMounting worms\nTiming: 1 min\nWorms move by swimming in a thin aqueous layer that surrounds their body surface. Agarose pads immobilize the animals by drying this layer of moisture, sticking the animals to the pad surface. If the pad is too thick it will quickly desiccate the animal, if too thin, the animal will crawl away. Even high-quality injection pads will dry the worms out after a few minutes, so do not mount more worms than you can easily inject in a 10-to-15-min interval. With experience mounting each worm should take less than one minute.\nDetermine the upper side of the injection pad by scratching an edge of the dried agarose with a razor blade or other metal object. This scratch mark can also be used for breaking needles later if needed. Mark on the agarose side of the pad can also be used if the slide is marked with an asymmetric letter.",
    "If desired, you can mark the boundaries of the agarose with a thin marker on either surface of the coverslip. Since the dried agarose is virtually transparent marking the boundaries helps in placing the worms on the agarose.\nUse a Pasteur Pipette to transfer a small drop of halocarbon oil onto the injection pad away from the agarose (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Use surface tension (not suction) on the pipette to move the oil to the injection pad. For working under the dissecting microscope place the injection pad on an inverted lid of petri dish for easier handling.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/974-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Mounting worms\nUse halocarbon oil to mount worms onto the injection pad. Align all the pachytene zones (sites of injection) of all the gonad arms towards the needle. Diagrams are not drawn to scale.\nTouch your worm pick to the surface of the halocarbon drop, and then use the viscous oil on the bottom of your pick to collect one or a few worms from your culture plate using the dissecting microscope. It is usually possible to choose worms that are off the bacterial lawn, but it may be necessary to move the worms briefly to an unseeded plate prior to picking them up with the halocarbon oil.",
    "Alternatives: Excess bacteria can also be removed from the worms after transferring them to the large halocarbon oil droplet on the injection pad. After depositing the worms into the large oil droplet, flame the pick and return to the oil drop. First quench the pick in the oil away from the worms and then move the pick underneath the worms and then quickly pull the worms through the oil to remove bacteria. Once the desired number of animals are floating in the oil drop and free of bacteria, select the worms for injection by placing the pick under them in the oil and moving them by lifting them on the pick to a dry area of the pad. Depending on your abilities and your experimental needs you can transfer either one (recommended for beginners), or up to several animals onto your pad for the first round of injections.",
    "Touch the pick down to the surface and move it laterally to deposit the worms in a row one after another (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). They should float off the pick in the oil. Carefully orient the worms with vulva and row of eggs facing to the left (if a right-handed system is being used). Gently push the worm down with the worm-pick by rubbing the pick along the body of the animal. If the animal is mostly stuck, then move onto the next animal. Make sure all the animals remain stuck and properly oriented. If possible, keep the worms within about 2–3 mm of each other so that you can move from one to the next without difficulty while working on the inverted microscope (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Finally, after the worms are stuck down dip your pick back into the large oil drop on the edge of the pad, then use your pick to deposit additional oil to fully cover the immobilized worms. This additional oil will prevent the worms from desiccating during the procedure.\nAlternatives: If you accidently orient some worms incorrectly you can either reorient them by gently pushing the worm off the pad with your pick and re-sticking them, or you can inject the worms oriented one way and then flip the slide to inject the ones facing the other way.\nMicroinjection and Worm recovery\nTiming: 30–60 min",
    "Microinjection into syncytium of hermaphrodite gonad (Mello et al., 1991[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]; Stinchcomb et al., 1985[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]) delivers Cas9-guideRNA complexes into dozens of germ nuclei simultaneously. Aim to inject the animals in the mid pachytene region. Injecting either in the distal or in the proximal end of the gonad is not ideal. Since the number of embryos produced by wildtype animals is limited by the availability of sperm, germ cells present in the distal region of the gonad arms do not get fertilized. Therefore, you should target the germ cells in the mid to late pachytene region. It should take approximately one minute to inject both gonad arms of each worm, and another minute or two to remove the injected animals to culture plates.\nFocus the objective (40×) onto the gonad (pachytene region) so that you can see two rows of nuclei (as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). This focal plane ensures that when inserted, the tip of the needle enters the core of the gonad and not above or below the somatic gonad. Do not focus on the honeycomb structure of the germ nuclei.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/974-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Microinjection\n(A) Using the 40× objective, focus on the two rows of germline nuclei as shown and insert the needle into the pachytene zone. Flow of the injection mixtures should reach mature oocytes in the proximal end of the germline as shown with yellow dotted line.\n(B) Snapshots from Methods Video S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/974-Mmc1.zip] are shown to illustrate the flow of the injection mixture. Germline is shown (1) before and (2) after injection. Arrows marks the region in the gonad until where the mixture has reached. 10× magnification is shown for illustration purposes, use 40× objective for the microinjection procedure.",
    "Without changing the focus and while looking through the eyepiece, slowly lower the needle into the oil drop. By adjusting the position of the stage bring the cuticle (at the pachytene region) very close to the needle tip (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nGently tap the micromanipulator so that the needle penetrates the cuticle and the somatic gonad, and enters the core germplasm. Gently move the stage towards the needle to adjust the position of the tip in the gonad. Do not insert the needle too far into the gonad as it ruptures the cuticle.\nPress the foot pedal to inject the mixture into the germplasm and make sure that the injection mixture flows smoothly onto either side of the needle tip over a period of two seconds (Methods Video S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/974-Mmc1.zip]). You should see the fluid entering the proximal region of the gonad and pushing the oocytes towards the spermatheca (Methods Video S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/974-Mmc1.zip] and Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). If the flow is excessive the worm or gonad can explode, reduce the pressure to achieve a lower flow rate. Inject into both arms of the gonad.\nRaise the needle to remove the injection pad. Move the pad onto the inverted lid under the dissecting scope.\nRecover the injected worms using mouth pipette (pulled glass capillary attached to Drummond aspirator tube) and sterile M9 buffer or MPEG (0.5% PEG in M9). Occasionally, worms stick to the glass pipette during the recovery process, and they are less likely to stick when MPEG is used. Other buffers are not necessary. Avoid using plastic pipette tips to recover the injected worms because they will stick to the tips.",
    "If the injections differed in quality, for example if only one arm was injected, these differences should be noted, and the worms separated, NGM plates labeled according to injection quality. When all the worms are injected place each injected animal singly onto a fresh NGM plate and culture for about 3.5 days at room temperature (22°C–23°C) unless genetic or experimental conditions demand other temperature conditions.\nScreening and genotyping\nTiming: 2 days\nIf both arms of the hermaphrodite gonad are injected, a good injection should yield 20–40 F1 Rollers. Screening strategy depends on the type of edit generated.\nAbout 72 h post injection, score the number of F1 Rollers and choose two plates with the highest number. The Rollers provide an important trouble-shooting metric (see below) and should always be included whenever possible.\nFor indels (without donor template) or ssODN donors, choose two P0 plates that segregate the highest number of F1 Rollers; pick 12–24 young adult F1 Rollers onto separate plates and allow them to have progeny prior to genotyping by PCR.",
    "For long dsDNA donors screening should be performed differently depending on the quality of the injections and the type of edit desired. If excellent bilateral injections were performed resulting in greater than 20 Roller progeny per injected animal, then choose two plates that segregate the highest number of F1 Rollers. If a fluorescent protein tag was inserted a quick look under the compound fluorescence microscope (or a dissecting Fluorescence microscope if the fluorescence is expected to be bright) will allow you to gauge how many F1 progeny to pick. To check under the compound microscope (preferred for genes whose expression levels are low or unknown) place ∼50 gravid adult F1 progeny younger than the rollers onto 2% wet agarose pads on a microscope slide (do not use dry injection pads) and immobilize with levamisole, then push the worms into proximity with the pick, gently place a cover slip on the top and check for fluorescent signal. If you wish you can memorize the location of positive animals and while working on a dissecting scope push the cover slip aside (do not flick it open) to directly recover the fluorescent positive animals. If PCR genotyping is the desired approach for detection, choose about 24 non-Rollers that are younger than the Rollers and place them onto separate NGM plates. Younger animals among Rollers can also be picked. For inexperienced injectors, we recommend using 5′ end-modified dsDNA donors and picking F1 Rollers.\nGenotype the F1 adults directly after allowing them to lay progeny. Alternatively, to avoid PCR false positives due to mosaicism, lyse several F2s from each plate and genotype. At least one of the genotyping primers should lie outside of the homology arms to avoid amplification from transiently retained donor molecules.",
    "Note: Strains obtained by genome editing should be back crossed to eliminate off-target indels. However, off-target indels on the same chromosome and close to the target site may be linked to the target site. Therefore, generating at least two independent alleles using different gRNAs is recommended."
