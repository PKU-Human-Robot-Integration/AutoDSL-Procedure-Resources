    "1. General radiation and radiopharmaceutical safety\nEnsure that radioactive materials are only worked with and handled by trained personnel. The dose to hospital staff, patients, and everyone else present should always be kept as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA).\nRegarding the preparation of radiopharmaceuticals, adhere to national laws, regulations, and guidelines, such as Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP).\n\tCAUTION: The following protocol is for the 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging of adults only and is not suitable for children or pregnant women.\n2. Preparations required prior to the labeling of 68Ga-DOTATATE\nElute the 68Ge/68Ga generator with hydrochloric acid (HCl) according to the manufacturer’s specifications, between 4 and 24 h prior to the start of labeling 68Ga-DOTATATE.\n3. Labeling of 68Ga-DOTATATE\nNOTE: The preparation for and labeling of 68Ga-DOTATATE takes 90 min and should be started 2 h prior to patient administration, to allow for quality control. The labeling module should be placed in a lead shielding that can be closed during the labeling process to ensure radiation protection of personnel. If a registered kit is used, then the summary of the product characteristics (SMPC) must be followed or cross-validated locally with the presented protocol.\nPlace the 68Ga labeling kit on the labeling module according to the manufacturer’s specifications. Place the three manifolds on the corresponding module units. Attach the solutions provided in the 68Ga labeling kit to the manifolds.\nPrepare the final vial in a sterile environment, such as a downflow unit or laminar flow cabinet.",
    "Place a nonvented 0.22 µm filter underneath a vented 0.22 µm filter and attach the nonvented filter to a sterile needle (20 G). Place the needle with the two filters attached in a 30 mL sterile vial. Place a vented 0.2 µm bent filter with a needle (22 G) in the same sterile vial as per step 3.2 to allow venting.\nAttach the sterile vial with the nonvented filter to the output of the labeling module and place the vial in the lead shielding sufficient for positron emitters.\nAttach the output of the 68Ga/68Ge generator to the input of the labeling module.\nDissolve 50 µg of HA-DOTATATE (DOTA-3-iodo-Tyr3-octreotate) or 20 µg of DOTATATE (DOTA-0-Tyr3-octreotate) peptide in 1.5 mL of 1.5 M HEPES buffer solution provided in the kit and place it in the reaction vial.\nClose the lead shielding around the labeling module and start the production of 68Ga-DOTATATE via the tablet computer attached to the labeling module.\nWait until the synthesis of 68Ga-DOTATATE is finished (~36 min).\nAfter labeling, remove the needles with filters from the glass vial and close the lead shielding around the vial.\nTest the integrity of the nonvented 0.22 µm filter as follows.\n\t\nFill a syringe (10 mL) with air and place the syringe on top of the filter. Place the needle attached to the filter in a tube filled with water.\nForce the air through the filter and needle and determine when bubbles begin to form. The air should be compressed to <20% of the original volume.\nMeasure the activity of 68Ga-DOTATATE produced by placing the vial in a dose calibrator and note the activity reference time (ART).",
    "In a sterile environment such as a laminar flow cabinet, remove 0.5 mL of 68Ga-DOTATATE from the vial for quality control and prepare syringes for patient administration.\n\tNOTE: Place the solution with 68Ga-DOTATATE in lead shielding. In this protocol, the diluted solution does not have to be shielded due to the low levels of activity and short exposure time. However, a radiation risk assessment should be performed prior to performing quality control of the 68Ga-DOTATATE.\n4. Quality control of 68Ga-DOTATATE prior to patient administration\nNOTE: The quality control of 68Ga-DOTATATE takes 30 min and should be started 30 min prior to patient administration. The described dilutions for stock solutions lead to <5% dead time in the measurement equipment. This can vary between different equipment and should be tested prior to performing quality control of the 68Ga-DOTATATE. The European Pharmacopoeia describes the quality control of gallium edotreotide injections based on the following release criteria: appearance = clear and colorless; pH = 4.0–8.0; sterility; endotoxins <175 IU per administered volume; ethanol <10% v/v; radionuclide purity >99.9% of total activity; radiochemical purity >91% of total activity; absence of other impurities; HEPES <200 µg per administered volume14. All tests have been evaluated during the validation of the preparation method. For routine quality control, a selected subset of tests (based on trend monitoring) is performed and described below. The solid-phase extraction in this protocol has been cross-validated with and obtains the same results as the high-performance liquid chromatography method described in the European Pharmacopoeia. This was performed based on GMP.\nPrepare the following solutions in advance.\n\t\nPrepare a 1 M ammonium acetate solution by dissolving 3.9 g of ammonium acetate in 50 mL of water. The solution can be stored at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.",
    "Prepare 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) by dissolving 0.1 g of EDTA in 50 mL of water. The solution can be stored at room temperature for up to 1 year.\nPrepare 50:50 methanol:1 M ammonium acetate. The solution can be stored at room temperature for up to 24 h.\nVisually inspect the final 68Ga-DOTATATE product to ensure that it is a colorless liquid without any particles.\nMeasure the pH of the 68Ga-DOTATATE solution with a pH indicator strip. The pH should lie between 6.5 and 7.5.\nMeasure 68Ga colloids through instant thin-layer chromatography (ITLC).\n\t\nAdd 500 µL of water and 20 µL of 68Ga-DOTATATE to prepare a stock solution and homogenize (68Ga colloids [GC]) by carefully shaking the vial.\nCut a strip of ITLC- silica gel (SG) glass fiber paper of at least 7 cm long and 1 cm wide.\n\t\tNOTE: Only use clean ITLC-SG paper without damages. If the paper is damaged, the components traveling with the solvent can be hindered and the results will be inaccurate.\nAdd 5 µL of GC 1.5 cm from the bottom of the ITLC-SG paper and place it in a tube containing 2 mL of 50:50 methanol:1 M ammonium acetate. Ensure that the 68Ga-DOTATATE does not come into contact with the liquid. Close the tubes to prevent evaporation.\nWait several minutes until the solvent has traveled at least 5 cm above where the 68Ga-DOTATATE was applied. Cut the paper in half and place the bottom and upper halves in separate tubes (BH1 and UH1).\nPlace the UH1 and BH1 tubes in a well counter and determine the number of counts in each vial in the 400–600 keV energy window for 30 s, to determine the colloid percentage (see the calculations in steps 4.4.7–4.4.9).\nRepeat steps 4.4.2–4.4.5 to acquire BH2 and UH2..",
