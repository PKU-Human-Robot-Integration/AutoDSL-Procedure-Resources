    "1. Sample collection\nPurchase different cultivars of fresh radish (Raphanus sativus L.).\n2. Isolation of Protein from Radish\nHomogenize approximately 100 g of fresh radish with a kitchen blender for 10 min.\nTransfer the slurry to a 50 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min to remove the insoluble material.\nTransfer the supernatant carefully into a new 50 mL centrifuge tube and add an equal volume of 2 M trichloroacetic acid (TCA) solution.\n\tNOTE: Adding TCA will precipitate soluble (glyco)proteins.\nCentrifuge at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min and remove the supernatant from the pelleted (glyco) proteins.\nWash the pellet with 20 mL of deionized water and centrifuge at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min to remove soluble oligosaccharides and polysaccharides.\nRepeat step 2.5. four times.\nRe-suspend the pellets in 1 mL of deionized water and transfer to a fresh 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.\n3. Preparation of N-Glycans\nMix 50 µL of protein solution from step 2.7. (equal to 5 g of fresh radish) with 0.2 mU of recombinant PNGase H+ in 10 mM acetic acid.\nIncubate the reaction mixture at 37 °C for 12 h. After the incubation, centrifuge at 14,000 × g for 5 min to remove the extra protein and enzyme.\nTransfer the supernatant to a fresh 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.\n4. Purification of N-Glycans\nPrepare the solid-phase extraction (SPE) column to enrich the N-glycans and remove salts and other impurities from the reaction mixture, increasing the selectivity of the fluorogenic 2-aminobenzamide (2-AB) labeling agent for N-glycan derivatization.\n\t\nAdd 3 mL of deionized water to wash the column.\nAdd 3 mL of 80% acetonitrile solution containing trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, 0.1% v/v) to active the SPE-column.",
    "Add 3 mL of deionized water to equilibrate the SPE-column.\nTransfer the sample from step 3.3 onto the column and discard the flow-through.\nAdd 1.5 mL of deionized water to wash the column and discard the flow-through.\nElute the released N-glycans from the column using 1.5 mL of aqueous 20% acetonitrile solution, containing 0.1% TFA (v/v) into a 2 mL centrifuge tube.\nRemove the solvent by centrifugal evaporation at room temperature. Evaporate until the sample is completely dry.\n5. Fluorescence Derivatization of N-Glycans\nPrepare 1 mL of 2-AB solution, consisting of 35 mM 2-AB and 0.1 M sodium cyanoborohydride in dimethyl sulfoxide/acetic acid solution (7:3, v/v).\nAdd 5 µL of 2-AB solution to the dried samples (step 4.5.) derived from six different radishes. Vortex each sample until completely dissolved.\nIncubate the mixture for 2 h at 65 °C.\nLet the sample cool down to room temperature for 5 min, and add 5 µL of deionized water and 40 µL of acetonitrile. Centrifuge the tubes at 14,000 x g for 3 min.\nTransfer 48 µL from the supernatant into a 300 µL high-recovery HPLC vial. Store the derivatized N-glycan samples at -20 °C for up to one month.\n6. HILIC-UPLC profiling of N-glycans\nAnalyze the samples using a standard UPLC system connected to an online fluorescence detectorset at the excitation/emission wavelengths of 330 nm/420 nm, respectively.\nUse a hydrophobic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC)-UPLC glycan column at a column temperature of 60 °C for the analysis.\nPrepare solvent A by diluting 50 mL of stock solution (1 M ammonium formate solution, pH 4.5) with 950 mL of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS)-grade water. Prepare the stock solution as follows:\n\t\nAdd 43 mL of formic acid to 700 mL of LCMS-grade H2O.",
    "Adjust the pH to 4.5 by dropwise addition of aqueous ammonia solution (25% w/w).\nTransfer the solvent to a measuring cylinder and fill up to 1000 mL with LCMS-grade H2O. Store at 4-6 °C for up to 3 months.\nUse LCMS-grade acetonitrile as solvent B.\nSeparate N-glycans with the following gradient elution:\n\t\nStart by adding 95% of solvent B into solvent A. Set the flow rate at 0.5 mL/min from 0 to 44.5 min.\nFrom 0 min to 6 min, gradually decrease the proportion of solvent B with a linear gradient to78%.\nFrom 6 min to 44.5 min, gradually decrease the proportion of solvent B with a linear gradient to 55.9%.\nFrom 44.5 min to 46.5 min, rapidly decrease the proportion of solvent B with a linear gradient from 55.9% to 0% and hold at 0% for 2 min, and initiate washing of the column. Reduce the flow rate to 0.25 mL/min from 44.5 to 55 min.\nWash the column further by increasing solvent B to 95% from 48.5 min to 50.5 min and hold at 95% for 4.5 min.\nRe-equilibrate the column to the starting conditions of 95% solvent B at 0.5 mL/min from 50.5 to 57 min.\nInject 45 µL of the sample into the UPLC system.\nElute the N-glycans by UPLC with retention times between 15 and 40 min.\nCollect each observed UPLC peak fraction using 2 mL centrifuge tubes and dry the samples by centrifugal evaporation.\nInject approximately 1 pmol of 2-AB labeled dextran standard (2−20 glucose units) to calibrate the plant-N-glycan profiling, and to assign their elution times into standardized glucose units.\n7. MALDI-TOF MS Analysis",
    "Dissolve the samples from step 6.8 in 5 µL of LCMS -grade water. Mix 1 µL of the sample solution and 1 µL of 6-aza-2-thiothymine (ATT) solution (0.3% w/v in 70% v/v aqueous acetonitrile), and pipette the mixture onto the MALDI-TOF sample carrier.\nAnalyze the samples using a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer instrument in positive ion mode by pressing the Start button.\nAnalyze the mass spectra by using the accompanying MALDI-TOF-MS analysis software.\nInterpret the spectra using an open source glycan interpretation software19. Set the search parameters for 2-AB labeling, [M+Na]+, and set the accuracy parameter to 2.0 Da.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
