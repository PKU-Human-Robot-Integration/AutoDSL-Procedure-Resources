    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCell counting and seeding\nTiming: Day 1, 1 h\nHandling the cells for this experiment does not require special treatment. We recommend optimizing the seeded cell number empirically.\nNote: The following steps will describe the protocol for using HEK293 cells. The protocol might be adjusted for the use with other cell lines. All media and buffers getting in contact with the cells should be prewarmed to 37°C using a water bath.\nRemove the cells cultivated within a 10 cm dish to a confluency of ∼90% from the incubator and detach the cells under sterile conditions.\nDilute Trypsin-EDTA to the desired final concentration with PBS. Typically, 0.05% of Trypsin-EDTA is sufficient for the trypsinization of HEK293 cells.\nPut the plate under the sterile cell culture hood, remove the cell culture medium, and replace the cell culture medium twice with 10 mL of pre-warmed PBS.\nRemove PBS and add 3 mL of a prewarmed, 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA in PBS.\nPut the cells back into the incubator and check for cell detachment after 2 min. If cells have not detached after 5 min, keep incubating them at 37°C and check for detachment every 1 min.\nWhen cells are floating, stop trypsinization by adding 10 mL of pre-warmed complemented medium (DMEM + 10% FCS + 1× penicillin-streptomycin + 1× sodium pyruvate).\nTransfer the cells to a 15 mL conical tube and pellet them at 200 × g for 5 min.\nAfter centrifugation, remove the supernatant from the cells without disturbing the cell pellet and fully resuspend the cell pellet in 10 mL of complemented-medium (DMEM + 10% FCS + 1× penicillin-streptomycin + 1× sodium pyruvate) carefully.\nDetermine the cell number/milliliter by counting the cells using a Bürker-Türk counting chamber or any other method of choice.",
    "When using a Bürker-Türk counting chamber, use 15 μL of cell suspension for one chamber. We recommend the determination of the cell number in duplicates by counting 2 × 4 large squares.\nFor each of the two chambers, divide the number of total cells counted in the 4 large squares by 4 and take the average of the two chambers.\nMultiply the number of cells × 10.000, which gives you the cell number/milliliter.\nSeed HEK293cells into the desired number of wells in a 6-well plate containing 30 mm circular glass coverslips and cultivate the cells for 16–24 h.\nPrepare the desired number of 6-well plates.\nPut 30 mm circular glass coverslips in the desired number of wells in 6-well plates.\nAdd 1 mL of complemented medium (DMEM + 10% FCS, + penicillin/ streptomycin, + 1× sodium pyruvate) and distribute the medium in the wells.\nUsing a sterile pipette tip, push the coverslips to the bottom of the 6-well plate to ensure that the coverslips firmly stick to the bottom of the plate to prevent cell growth beneath the glass coverslip.\nDilute the cells to an appropriate cell number/milliliter and seed into the wells of the 6-well plate containing the glass coverslips.\nThe cell number that needs to be seeded varies with the time between seeding the cells and performing the experiment. For HEK293 cells that should be investigated 2 days after seeding, typically 300.000 cells per well are sufficient to achieve a density of approximately 70–80% on the day of the experiment, which is ideal for the assays.",
    "Ideally, the final culture volume per well is 1.5 mL. Dilute the cell number of the HEK293 cells to 600.000/mL and add 500 μL of the cell suspension to each well of the 6-well plate containing the glass coverslip, yielding a final culture volume of 1.5 mL and a cell number of 300.000 cells/well.\nPut the 6-well plates into a humidified incubator with 37°C and 5% CO2 for 16–24 h and cultivate the cells.\nCell transfection with the sensor plasmids\nTiming: Day 2, 1 h\nThe genetic information of the sensors, i.e., the plasmids, needs to be delivered to the cells. Therefore, different transfection methods, electroporation, or viral transduction may be used.\nNote: In this protocol, we describe how to transfect HEK293 cells using the PolyJet transfection reagent. Depending on the transfection reagent, the protocol may vary, and other reagents/methods for plasmid delivery might be required for different cell types.\nPerform a medium change of the cells seeded the day before.\nRemove the cells from the incubator (humidified, 37°C, 5% CO2) and check the cells using a cell culture microscope for their morphology, density, and possible bacterial or fungal contaminations.\nIf the cells should be measured at the fluorescence microscope the next day, HEK293 cells should show a density of approximately 40%–50% on the day of the transfection.\nRemove the medium from each well that will be transfected with a sensor plasmid and carefully add 1 mL of fresh and prewarmed complemented medium (DMEM + 10% FCS, + penicillin/ streptomycin, + 1× sodium pyruvate) to each well.\nAfter changing the medium, return the cells to the incubator for 30 min.\nPrepare the transfection mixture using the plasmid of choice and PolyJet transfection reagent. For PolyJet transfection also see: https://signagen.com/DataSheet/SL100688.pdf[href=https://signagen.com/DataSheet/SL100688.pdf]",
    "Approximately 20 min after putting the cells back into the incubator, start with preparing the transfection mixture.\nTherefore, 50 μL of FCS-free DMEM medium are prepared for each well that will be transfected with a plasmid. Hence, if two 6-well plates will be transfected with two different probes (probe A and B), 2 × 300 μL of serum-free DMEM are required and put in separate tubes (tubes A and B). Per transfected well, 1.0 μg of plasmid DNA should be added. For mitochondria-targeted constructs, the DNA amount should be reduced to 0.3 μg/well to ensure proper mitochondrial targeting of the probes.\nFor each well that will be transfected, 50 μL of FCS-free DMEM are prepared in a separate tube (tube C) for the transfection reagent. Hence, if two 6-well plates will be transfected (this is independent of the number of different plasmids), 600 μL of serum-free DMEM are pipetted in tube C. Subsequently, 3 μL of PolyJet transfection reagent are added for each well that should be transfected and the tube is mixed by pipetting.\nAfter the DNA (tube A and B) and PolyJet transfection reagent (tube C) were prepared, the DNA-containing medium and PolyJet-medium mixtures are mixed at a 1:1 ratio. Hence, if 300 μL of the DNA-medium mixture are in tube A, 300 μL of the PolyJet-media mixture from tube C are added, followed by thorough mixing by pipetting. The same applies to the second sensor in tube B, which is also mixed in a 1:1 ratio with 300 μL of tube C. Mixtures are incubated for 10 min at 20°C–25°C.\nAfter 10 min of incubating the DNA-transfection mixtures, the transfection mixtures are added to the cells.",
    "The cells are removed from the incubator and 100 μL of each transfection mixture is added in a drop-by-drop manner to each well of the 6-well plate that should be transfected with the respective probe.\nOnce the mixtures are added, the cells are returned to the incubator and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 12–16 h.\nNote: Depending on the cell type used, other transfection reagents, incubation times, plasmid- or transfection reagent amounts may be required.\nCritical: The transfection mixture containing the transfection reagent and the plasmid DNA must be prepared in FCS free medium. Furthermore, after mixing the reagent and plasmid DNA together, the vial should incubate without perturbations to allow the transfection complex to form.\nPreparing cells for the experiments\nTiming: Day 3, 20 min\nOn the day of an experiment, the cells should be removed from the incubator and the transfection mixture is replaced with the cell equilibration buffer. This allows the cells to acclimate to the environment of the recording conditions, which ensures data consistency.\n12–16 h after adding the transfection mixture to the cells, the transfection mixture should be removed and cells should be equilibrated in the cell equilibration buffer.\nPre-warm PBS and the cell-equilibration buffer to 37°C using a water bath.\nRemove the cells from the incubator and check the morphology, density, and possible contaminations using a cell culture microscope.\nExchange the medium of the cells for the cell-equilibration buffer.\nRemove all medium from the cells.\nCarefully replace the medium 1× with PBS by adding 1.5 mL of PBS / well to remove any residual medium.",
    "Subsequently, remove the PBS and carefully add 1.5 mL/well of the cell-equilibration buffer. Keep cells in the dark at 20°C–25°C until they are measured. We recommend pre-equilibrating the cells for at least 30 min to allow their adaption to their new environment.\nNote: Cell pre-equilibration with the cell-equilibration buffer may be omitted if desired and cells might directly be measured from the incubator.\nOptional: The cells can also be cultivated for a longer period after their transfection (e.g. additional 24 h). In such cases, the transfection mixture should be exchanged for fresh complemented medium (DMEM + 10% FCS + 1× penicillin-streptomycin + 1× sodium pyruvate) after 12–16 h. The cells can then be further cultivated in DMEM + 10% FCS + 1× penicillin-streptomycin + 1× sodium pyruvate until the experiments will be conducted.\nCritical: It is important to remove the cationic lipids contained in the transfection mixture after 16 hours as a prolonged exposure will increase the toxcicity of the mixture.\nComplementing buffers for the experiments\nTiming: Day 3, 30 min\nDepending on the information that should be obtained from the experiments, a nutrient-free imaging buffer should be complemented with specific nutrients or modulators of cell metabolism such as inhibitors/activators of oxidative or glycolytic activity.\nNote: In this protocol, we will describe how to complement the buffers for extracting information about the mitochondrial activity, as well as cell metabolic glucose and HKII dependency, and intracellular K+ sensitivity. This analysis is based on the use of 3-bromo-2-oxopropionic acid (3-BP), oligomycin-A, and antimycin-A which either inhibit hexokinase-2 or the ATP-synthase and complex III, respectively. Additionally, gramicidin is used to deplete intracellular K+ stores.\nComplement the buffers with the required compounds.\nPre-warm nutrient-free imaging buffer to 20°C–25°C.\nAliquot 200 mL of buffer in a new bottle without adding additional compounds (= IB -GLU).",
    "Add 10 mM of d-glucose to the residual 800 mL of buffer (= IB + GLU).\nAliquot 200 mL of basal imaging buffer in a new bottle and add 3-BP at a final concentration of 300 μM (= IB + 3-BP) from a 300 mM H2O stock (1:1000 dilution).\nAliquot 200 mL of basal imaging buffer in a new bottle and add oligomycin-A and antimycin-A at final concentrations of 3 μM and 5 μM (= IB + O/A) from 10 mM DMSO stocks, respectively (1:3333 and 1:2000 dilutions, respectively).\nAliquot 200 mL of basal imaging buffer in a new bottle and add gramicidin at final concentrations of 15 μM (= IB + GRAM) from a 15 mM DMSO stock (1:1000 dilution).\nNote: Other concentrations, modulators, or combinations of metabolic modulators may be used to receive further information about cell metabolic activity.\nCritical: Ideally, buffers are freshly complemented with glucose and the metabolic modulators (3-BP, oligomycin-A and antimycin-A, and gramicidin) on the day of the imaging experiments due to the potential instability of the compounds in an aqueous solution.\nPreparing the microscope and the perfusion system for the experiments\nTiming: Day 3, 30 min\nPrior to the measurements, the microscope, PC, imaging software, and perfusion system software should be started, followed by the adjustment of the parameters for the subsequent measurements.\nStart the PC and open the perfusion system software to prepare the perfusion system.\nWash the perfusion system to get rid of any residual components left from older experiments.\nOpen the number of channels that are necessary for the measurements + one for cleaning, and wash every syringe of the perfusion system with 10 mL of 70% ethanol.\nWhen the ethanol has passed, add 20 mL of ddH2O per syringe to remove residual ethanol.",
    "Close the valves of the perfusion system using the perfusion system software and prepare the system with selected buffers.\nFill one buffer in each of the syringes.\nShortly open the valves of the perfusion system to remove air from the tubings.\nAs the buffers contain toxic components, repeat steps 5.a.i.–5.a.ii. with the channel used for cleaning to remove residual compounds.\nOnce all air is removed from the tubes and the system is cleaned, the channel containing the “basal buffer” (IB + GLU) should be opened to prepare the system for the first experiment and the flow rate of the perfusion system should be adjusted to approximately 1 mL/min using tube clamps. Subsequently, perfusion can be stopped by closing all valves in the software.\nOpen the Imaging software and adjust the imaging parameters.\nAll the sensors presented in this protocol represent FRET-based probes utilizing CFP and YFP, hence, the excitation maximum of all probes is close to 430 nm and emission maxima are close to 475 nm (CFP) and 530 nm (FRET).\nUsing the described microscope setup, at a binning of 4, a LED intensity at 455 nm of ∼1%–2%, an exposure time of ∼200 ms and an interval time of ∼3 s are good starting points.\nAdjust the settings of the microscope for simultaneous detection of CFP- and FRET emission upon excitation with the 455 nm LED and the 427/10 excitation filter.\nNote: We recommend using a 40× oil immersion objective to investigate the proper localization of the fluorescent probes upon expression in the mammalian cells.\nNote: Light intensities should be minimized to prevent phototoxic effects and photobleaching as much as possible. To maintain suitable fluorescent intensities for measurements, the camera binning can be increased to yield higher fluorescence emission signals from the cells, while keeping excitation light intensities low.",
    "Note: Depending on the expected duration of the experiment, imaging intervals should be adjusted to prevent phototoxic effects and photobleaching as much as possible. For longer measurements (e.g. slow responses/effects), imaging intervals of several seconds (for example 10 s) might be chosen instead of imaging every 3 s.\nCritical: Although imaging parameters have to be adjusted for every sensor, these parameters should not be changed when measuring the same sensor on a different day. Keeping the same settings for one sensor guarantees consistency (e.g. comparable dynamic range) throughout various measurements (either on the same day or on different days).\nPreparing the experiments\nTiming: Day 3, 10 min\nAfter 30 min of cell equilibration in the cell equilibration buffer, experiments can be started.\nCarefully transfer a glass coverslip containing the cells from the 6-well plate to the perfusion chamber.\nA 25G needle and sharp forceps are helpful for the coverslip transfer. Alternatively, a commercially available lens lifter can be used.\nEnsure that no edge of the coverslip is damaged or broken, as this will lead to leakiness of the perfusion chamber.\nProperly place the coverslip in the notch of the lower part of the perfusion chamber (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1035-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Representation of the perfusion chamber\nPhotograph of the (A) unmounted and (B) mounted perfusion chamber.\n(C) Displays the perfusion chamber placed on top of a microscope stage. Inlet and outlet of the chamber are indicated.\nSubsequently, close the perfusion chamber by inserting the sealing ring in the upper part of the chamber (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) and put the upper part on top of the lower part (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). Add 1 mL of the cell equilibration buffer to ensure hydration of the cells.",
    "Tightly close the perfusion chamber by twisting (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) and remove excess buffer with a paper towel. Check the tightness of the perfusion chamber by using a fresh, dry paper towel and carefully move around the bottom of the glass coverslip. If the chamber is tight, the towel will remain dry.\nPlace the perfusion chamber on top of the microscope and start perfusing the cells with IB + GLU.\nIf using an oil immersion objective, add a drop of fluorescence-suitable immersion oil on the objective.\nPut the perfusion chamber on top of the microscope and fix it (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nAttach the tube of the perfusion system to the inlet (on one side) of the perfusion chamber (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nOpen the valve of IB + GLU buffer to start perfusing the cells.\nCheck for functional perfusion (i.e., increasing volume in the chamber) and attach the tube of the vacuum pump to the other side of the chamber (outlet) to prevent buffer overflow and to ensure a laminar flow of the buffer across the coverslip (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nScreen the coverslip for a suitable imaging section with cells showing a good signal to noise ratio and proper targeting of the respective fluorescent probe (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).

Representative fluorescence wide-field images of HEK293 cells\nImages display fluorescence wide-field images of the CFP- (cyan, upper images) and FRET-fluorescence (yellow, lower images) of HEK293 cells expressing (from left to right): FLII12Pglu-700μδ6, mtAT1.03, NES lc-LysM GEPII 1.0 or mt lc-LysM GEPII 1.0. Arrow indicates a cell where a mitochondrial construct is mistargeted in the cytosol/ nucleus. Scale bar represents 20 μm.\nOnce a section was found, the imaging experiment can be started.",
    "Critical: For fluorescent probes targeted to the mitochondrial matrix (mtAT1.03 and mt lc-LysM GEPII 1.0), ensure that cells show a correct targeting of these sensors (solely mitochondrial fluorescence) and do not show cytosolic and/or nuclear mistargeting. We highly recommend performing a preliminary experiment testing for correct targeting and expression of the sensor. Excessive mistargeting can also be caused by the usage of too high DNA or PolyJet transfection reagent concentrations. Also ensure that the cell confluency within the area of interest is not too high, as this will lead to slower cell responses due to limited buffer/compound diffusion.\nMeasurement of cytosolic glucose and K+ and mitochondrial ATP and K+ dynamics\nTiming: Day 3, ∼25 min per experiment\nUpon identification of cells suitable for imaging, the actual experiment can be started.\nSelect your cells of interest and follow the fluorescence over-time of the CFP- and FRET emissions.\nStart recording the images at a distinct light intensity, exposure time, binning, and interval. Make sure to not select the brightest cells, as it will then be difficult to keep the settings for the next experiments. Cells possessing average fluorescence intensities that are representative for the whole population might be measured instead.\nDraw regions of interest around every cell of interest. Also include one background region, which is important for later analysis. Make sure to select a background region that does not show any fluorescence signal coming from neighboring cells.\nRecord the baseline of both fluorescence intensities in IB+GLU buffer for 5 min. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7].\nAfter 5 min, switch to one of the experimental buffers, either containing no glucose (IB -GLU), 3 μM oligomycin-A and 5 μM antimycin-A (IB + O/A), 300 μM 3-BP (IB +3-BP) or 15 μM gramicidin (IB + GRAM).",
    "After switching to the experimental buffers, keep recording the fluorescence over-time values for at least 10 min or until the ratio over-time has stabilized again. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9].\nPerform steps a-e for cells transfected with each sensor (mtAT1.03, FLII12Pglu-700μδ6, NES lc-LysM GEPII 1.0, and mt lc-LysM GEPII 1.0, at least 5 times on 3 different days (with the same settings for each sensor) to ensure data consistency and to ensure a stable average for each treatment and sensor (Bischof et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Imamura et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Takanaga et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nAfter the experiment has finished, stop the image acquisition, export the fluorescence over-time values, e.g., to Microsoft Excel, stop the perfusion system, withdraw the coverslip and extensively wash the perfusion system and -chamber with ethanol and subsequently with ddH2O.\nStart the next experiment by repeating steps 7–9.\nAnalyze data\nTiming: Day 4, 2 h\nAfter performing the experiments and data export to Microsoft Excel, analysis can be performed for data interpretation and representation.\nCorrect the fluorescence over-time values of every cell measured for the corresponding background intensity.\nSubtract the fluorescence over-time of the cyan channel from the CFP signal of the cells and subtract the fluorescence over-time values of the FRET-channel from the FRET signal of the cells.\nCalculate the FRET-ratio signal by dividing the background-corrected values of FRET/CFP and plot the FRET-ratio signal over-time (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1035-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "(B) Shows the representative single cell fluorescence over-time courses of CFP- (cyan) and FRET-signal (yellow) of the respective FRET-based probes as demonstrated in (A) of one single cell in response to the same treatment.\nIn case of observing a signal in the FRET-ratio over-time, ensure that the signal is ratiometric, i.e., CFP- and FRET-intensities show opposite responses (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). A de- or increase in both channels will most likely point to other effects rather than a FRET change due to binding of the respective ion/metabolite.\nIf desired, correct the FRET-ratio over-time for potential fluorescence bleaching effects using the following equation:\n   R 0  =  R  i n i t i a l   ⋅ exp  (  − K ⋅ T i m e  )  +  R  p l a t e a u    \nR0 = function of the bleaching correction curve\nRinitial = maximal fluorescence ratio signal once imaging has started\nK = rate constant of fluorescence bleaching over-time\nRplateau = minimal fluorescence ratio reached by bleaching over-time\nOne of the easiest ways to correct for photobleaching using the given formula is to use the one phase decay function provided by GraphPad Prism (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1035-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Although it can be reduced to an absolute minimum by adjusting imaging parameters, corrections, as described, may be necessary.\nCritical: Check the correctness of the photobleaching correction procedure by comparing the uncorrected raw curves/responses with the curves after correction. Bad curve fitting may lead to over- or underestimation of responses/ effects, hence, always double-check. Other corrections than the one-phase-decay might also be tested in case of bad fitting. The exact shape of the plots shown in Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C and 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C requires an extremly thoroughful and exact timing of the experiments. For example, the total duration of the entire experiment as well as the superfusion of the cells with e.g., gramicidin needs to follow identical schedules for all measurements that will be transferred to XY plots."
