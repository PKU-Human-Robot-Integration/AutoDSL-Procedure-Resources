    "Initial preparations Prior to beginning any procedures, disinfect all surgical tools and working areas with 70% ethanol.Next, prepare a culture dish by filling it with 4 mL of HBSS dissociation solution (see Recipes) for the initial collection and cleaning of DRG tissues. Prepare two microtubes with 1 mL of HBSS dissociation solution each, where the cleaned tissues will be transferred. Place the culture dish and microtubes on ice at 4 °C.The papain and collagenase solutions (see Recipes) can also be prepared at this time and kept at 4 °C. Warm these solutions and DMEM culture medium (see Recipes) to 37 °C just before use.Terminally anesthetize a mouse by placing the animal in a jar/chamber for anesthesia. Add a gauze with 1 mL of isoflurane to the jar, and the mouse will be anesthetized within a minute. To ensure complete anesthesia, check for a lack of response to a pinch of the rear footpad.Next, use scissors to decapitate the mice in a sink for the purpose of euthanasia and blood removal. This will facilitate the tissue dissection process.Tissue dissection Move the mouse to a designed tissue dissection area and liberally spray the back fur with 70% ethanol.To expose the back muscles, make a large transverse cut in the middle of the back skin using standard scissors. Then, pull the skin in opposite directions to remove all of the back skin.To remove the back muscles, make two long cuts close to the left and right sides of the spinal column. Then, use forceps to pull away the muscles starting from the rostral end.To expose the spinal cord and DRGs, perform a laminectomy by removing the top of the vertebral canal.",
    "Use spring scissors to cut the bones on both sides of the vertebral canal in a 45° angle to avoid damaging or losing the DRGs. Continue cutting from side to side while lifting the top of the vertebral canal, starting from the rostral end and working your way down to the caudal end of the spinal column.Next, use forceps to slowly remove the spinal cord in a rostral to caudal direction from the column and expose the DRGs. Discard the spinal cord. The DRGs are located in the dorso-lateral position of the vertebral canal and can be recognized by their round shape and hyaline appearance, which is different from the white color of the attached nerve fibers (Supplementary Figure 1).Using the stereomicroscope, grasp the dorsal root with #5 forceps, carefully pull it a few millimeters, and cut the spinal nerve (immediately distal to the ganglion) with spring scissors. Next, cut the dorsal root and place the collected DRGs in the culture dish on ice. Typically, an experienced experimenter can collect approximately 40 ganglia per mouse.If needed, move the culture dish under the stereomicroscope and use a pair of spring scissors and #5 forceps to remove any extra nerves, roots, and connective tissues from the DRGs. Then, transfer the cleaned DRGs equally into two microtubes.Cell dissociation Centrifuge the microtubes containing the cleaned DRGs at 200× g for 1 min and remove the HBSS dissociation solution.Perform the first enzymatic dissociation by adding 1.5 mL of papain solution into the microtubes. Gently flick the microtubes to resuspend the DRGs and incubate them for 20 min in a 37 °C water bath.Note: Do not resuspend with a pipette or vigorously shake to maintain the integrity of the cells. Centrifuge the microtubes at 200× g for 1 min and remove the papain solution.",
    "Wash the DRGs with 1 mL of HBSS dissociation solution, centrifuge (200× g for 1 min), and remove the solution.Perform the second enzymatic dissociation by adding 1.5 mL of collagenase solution into the microtubes. Gently flick the microtubes to resuspend the DRGs and incubate them for 20 min in a 37 °C still water bath.Note: Do not resuspend with the pipette or vigorously shake to maintain the integrity of the cells. Centrifuge the microtubes at 200× g for 1 min and remove all the collagenase solution.Note: From this point forward, the opening of tubes/plates that contain any tissue, cells, media, or reagents should be done in a laminar flow cell culture hood. Resuspend the DRGs in 1 mL of DMEM culture medium. Centrifuge at 200× g for 1 min and carefully remove all culture solution without disturbing the tissue.Resuspend the DRGs in 0.5 mL of DMEM culture medium. Perform mechanical dissociation by trituration using a P1000 pipette until the solution becomes cloudy (approximately 15–20 times up and down). During trituration, the tissues should pass through the tip with a little friction initially and progress to passing easily. Be gentle and avoid introducing air bubbles at this step; this is critical.Add 1 mL of DMEM culture medium to each microtube. Next, transfer the contents of all microtubes into one 50 mL conical tube. Adjust the volume to approximately 5 mL with DMEM culture medium and gently mix the contents by flicking the tube.Filter the mixture using a 40 μm cell strainer followed by a 10 μm cell strainer. Collect the filtrate each time in a 50 mL tube. If necessary, adjust the volume of the filtrate to 5 mL with DMEM culture medium and resuspend the cells by gently flicking the tube.",
    "Cell plating and growth Transfer the resuspended cells into a 12-well microplate by pipetting 400 μL of the filtrate into each well containing sterilized cover glasses. Then, incubate the plate in a CO2 cell culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2).Note: During this incubation (24 h), due to the lack of coating of the cover glasses and use of DMEM low-glucose media, SGC cells will attach to the bottom of the dish while the DRG neurons and debris will remain in suspension. One day after plating the cells, replace the DMEM culture medium with 400 μL of fresh DMEM culture medium to remove cell debris. Always pre-warm the culture medium to 37 °C before use.SGCs proliferate and develop a spindle-shaped morphology (Figure 1) during the next 10–14 days. To maintain SGCs cultures, replace the DMEM culture medium every 2–3 days."
