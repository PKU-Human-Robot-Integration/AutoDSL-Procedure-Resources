    "1. Liposome Preparation\nDissolve the lipids 1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), 1-stearoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (MSPC or S-lyso-PC) and N-(carbonyl-methoxypolyethyleneglycol 2000)-1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (mPEG2000-DSPE) in chloroform. For example, for preparation of 10 ml  of HTLC, weigh out 314.4 mg DPPC, 39.4 mg MSPC, and 83.9 mg mPEG2000-DSPE into an amber glass vial. Then, dissolve the lipids in 2 ml of chloroform and heat up the vial for 30 sec in a 60 °C water bath.\nRemove the chloroform using a rotary evaporator. Place the resulting lipid film under high-pressure vacuum O/N.\nFor 10 ml  of HTLC, hydrate the lipid film with 5 ml  0.1N Tris buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 hr. At the same time, weigh out 162.4 mg 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DPPG) lipid and 100 mg CDDP powder and hydrate with 5 ml  0.1N Tris buffer containing 30% ethanol (pH 7.4) for 1 hr.\nFor the Gd-HTLC formulation, weigh out the same amount of DPPG lipid and 10 mg CDDP powder, then hydrate with 2.5 ml  Gd-HP-DO3A solution (279.3 mg/ml ) plus 2.5 ml  0.1N Tris buffer containing 30% ethanol (pH 7.4) for 1 hr. During hydration, the mixtures must be kept in amber vials and placed on a hotplate at 70 °C with constant stirring and vortexing every 10 min.\nCombine the lipid mixture and the lipid drug mixture, and again hydrate for 1 hr. Vortex every 15-20 min.\nAssemble the 10-ml  extruder with two stacks of 200 nm polycarbonate filters. Connect the thermobarrel of the extruder to a circulating water bath at 70 °C, and connect the extruder to a compressed nitrogen tank.",
    "Immediately after hydration, transfer the mixture into the extruder chamber. Open the nitrogen flow (set pressure to 200 psi) to extrude the liposomes through the membranes. Collect the liposomes in a 50 ml  tube. Keep the tube in a hot water bath (70 °C) at all times during the extrusion process. Repeat this process 5 times.\nDisassemble the extruder and change to two stacks of 100 nm polycarbonate filters. Reassemble the extruder and set the pressure to 400 psi. Repeat Step 5, except extrude the liposomes 10 times. Collect the sample from the final extrusion into a 15 ml  tube.\nCool down the liposomes to RT, and centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 3 min to precipitate insoluble CDDP.\nDialyze the liposomes O/N against 0.9% saline in dialysis tubing with a 15,000 molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) under sterile conditions.\nDilute 10 µl of the liposomes in 990 µl distilled water. Use dynamic light scattering to measure the size distribution of HTLC and Gd-HTLC. Perform 3 measurements with 10 runs each.\nDilute 40  µl of the liposomes in 3,960 µl distilled water. Make 5-6 standard solutions of platinum and gadolinium in the concentration range of 0.1 to 20 µg/ml . Measure the platinum and gadolinium concentrations using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) at 3 different wavelengths. Perform 3 measurements at each wavelength for average result.\nDetermine the gel to liquid crystalline phase transition temperature (Tm) of the HTLC liposome formulation using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Load 5-10 mg of HTLC into a DSC pan and use an empty pan as a reference. Use a scan rate of 5 °C/min to ramp up the temperature from 0 °C to 60 °C.\nWrap the liposomes in aluminum foil to prevent light exposure and store at 4 °C.",
    "2. In vitro Release from Liposomes\nPrepare spin columns.\n\t\nIncubate 50 g gel filtration beads in 400 ml  0.9% saline at RT for 3-4 hr. Roll up a piece of glass wool, wet with 0.9% saline and place it into the tip of a 1 ml  syringe. Press the glass wool to fill approximately 0.05-0.1 ml  of the syringe. Use a glass pipette to gradually add about 1 ml gel filtration media into the syringe.\nPlace the syringe into a 15 ml  tube and centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 3 min. Remove the spin column and place it into a 15 ml  tube.\nSample 400 µl of HTLC or Gd-HTLC into 8 1-dram glass vials and incubate in a temperature controlled water bath at either 37 °C or 42 °C. Take out one vial at each time point (i.e., 5, 15, 30 and 60 min) and immediately place it on ice.\nAdd 100 µl of 0.9% saline into the prepared spin column, then add 100 µl of HTLC or Gd-HTLC before incubation (control) or after incubation in the water bath into the spin column. Centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 3 min. Remove the syringe from the tube and dilute the solution in the tube for ICP-AES analysis.\n3. Implantation of Subcutaneous Xenograft of Cervical Tumor\nAll animal studies were conducted according to animal use protocols approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University Health Network (UHN).\nPerform all animal studies in a Biosafety Cabinet (BSC). Autoclave all surgical tools before any surgery. After each surgery, wipe the surgical tools with 70% ethanol and sterilize again using a hot bead sterilizer.\nFor euthanasia, place the animal in an insulated CO2 chamber, then perform cervical dislocation.",
    "For general anesthesia using 100% oxygen, use 5% isofluorane for induction and 2% for maintenance. To ensure the depth of anesthesia, apply pressure with forceps to palmar surface of the footpad to observe animal response. Apply eye lubricant to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nFor an animal that has undergone surgery, place the animal in a clean cage without the company of other animals. Monitor until sufficient consciousness is regained.\nCulture the ME-180 cells in alpha-minimal essential medium (α-MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics.\nHarvest the cells and keep the cells in complete media before inoculation. Count the cells using a hemocytometer.\nInoculate each donor mouse to bear an intramuscular (i.m.) ME-180 (human cervical cancer cells) tumor.\n\tNote: Growth at the i.m. site has been selected in order to ensure the development of well vascularized tumors. Purchase female SCID mice (aged 6-8 weeks, approximately 20 g) from an in-house breeding facility.\n\t\nAnesthetize a female SCID mouse and inject 1 x 106 ME-180 cells into the gastrocnemius muscle of the hind limb using a 27 G needle.\nMeasure tumor size using a caliper until the tumors have reached 9-12 mm in their longest dimension. Terminate the study if the tumor has exceeded 12 mm, or if the tumor mass compromises normal behavior, ambulation, food and water intake.\nImplant tumor pieces from donor mice into recipient mice.\n\t\nAnesthetize a donor mouse using 5% isofluorane. Euthanize the mouse using cervical dislocation under anesthesia. Remove the donor tumor from the donor mouse. Cut the tumor into cubic fragments of 2-3 mm3.",
    "Anesthetize a recipient mouse using 5% isofluorane. Inject 100 μl of 0.5 mg/ml meloxicam subcutaneously before surgery. Apply iodine surgical scrub solution, then 70% ethanol, and lastly iodine solution to the shaved skin.  Shave the left hind limb of the recipient mouse. Make an incision at the level of skin. Insert one donor tumor piece subcutaneously through the incision. Close the incision using 1-2 wound clip(s).\nRemove the clips 3-5 days after implantation. Subcutaneous tumor is required for using the laser-based heating setup.\nAllow tumors to grow for 2-3 weeks before heating treatment.\n4. Design, Assembly and Calibration of a Conformal Laser Delivery Illuminator for In Vivo Heating\nAchieve tissue heating using a 763 nm diode laser coupled to a conformal illuminator using an optical fiber.\n\t\nThe illuminator provides uniform superficial laser illumination of the xenograft tumor. It is composed of a 30 x 20 x 17 mm block of highly reflective material containing three adjoined light integrating chamber spheres with one chamber in the middle (16 mm in diameter) and 2 small chambers on either side (16 mm in length and 5 mm in diameter) (Figure 1).\nIn order for light to pass from one chamber into the other, two small 5 mm diameter holes were cut between the small outer chambers and the larger middle chamber. Light is delivered from the laser into the outer chambers using a 400 µm cut-end fiber connected to the laser that is passed into the chamber through a 600 µm diameter hole.\nDue to the nature of light interaction with the chamber walls, light delivered into one of the small chambers is spatially homogenized then passes through the interior ports into the larger chamber where it is further spatially homogenized. Light then exits the 10 mm diameter port on the middle chamber.",
    "Calibrate the illuminator light delivery with respect to the laser power setting using a NIST calibrated 50 mm integrating sphere to measure the delivered power.\n\t\nCalculate the light distribution in the tumor using Monte Carlo simulations based on a simplified geometry of the tumor. Generate the Monte Carlo code in a custom algorithm written with a commercial computational software package and base on the standard code of Monte Carlo modeling of light transport in multi-layered tissues of Jacques et al.14.\nModel the tumor as a hemisphere lying on a flat skin line with a diameter matching the average tumor dimension of 7 mm at the skin surface and a height of 5 mm. Model homogeneous illumination of the surface by randomly launching photons throughout the exposed hemisphere and direct at the center of the sphere.\nUse optical properties including absorption, µa = 0.025 mm-1, scattering, µs = 10 mm-1, anisotropy factor, g = 0.9 and refractive index, n=1.4. Use one million photons in the calculation.\nPerform these measurements before any in vivo heating experiments with no further modifications after initial calibration.\n5. Conformal Heating of Tumor using Custom-designed Laser Chamber Setup\nConnect one end of a laser fiber to the laser device and the other end to the illuminator.\nAnesthetize the animal using 5% isofluorane. Insert a 27 G injection catheter into the lateral tail vein of the mouse. Insert a 22 G catheter into the center of the tumor. Place a fiber optic temperature probe into the hollow catheter to monitor temperature change.\nCover the entire tumor with the illuminator (Figure 2). First set the power to 0.8-1 W. Turn on the laser and wait for the temperature to rise. Maintain the temperature of the tumor at 42 °C by manually adjusting the laser power between 0.1-0.8 W.",
    "6. Temperature Distribution Evaluated Through MR Thermometry (MRT)\nMeasure the temperature distribution of the heated tumor using the laser-based heating setup through proton resonance frequency shift (PRF-shift) MRT on a 7 Tesla preclinical MR imaging system15 in conjunction with the fiber optic temperature probe measurements.\nAcquire thermometry images at 10 sec intervals using a 2D-FLASH pulse sequence (echo time 4.5 msec; repetition time 156.25 msec) with 312 x 312 µm in-plane resolution and 2 mm slice thickness in a single slice at the level of the fiber optic temperature probe.\n7. MR Monitoring of Agent Release\nPerform T1-weighted imaging prior to and 20 min after administration of Gd-HTLC.\nImplant two tumors, one on each of the hind limbs, of a female SCID mouse using the method described above in Section 3 for the implantation. Preheat the tumor on the left hind limb for 5 min at 42 °C prior to injection of Gd-HTLC at a dose of 66.3 mg/kg Gd-HP-DO3A and 1.4 mg/kg CDDP, then heat the tumor for an additional 20 min post-injection. Perform injection during heating treatment. Use the tumor on the right hind limb as an unheated control.\nAcquire dynamic MR images (36 x 20 mm field-of-view, 200 x 200 µm in-plane resolution, 2 mm slice thickness; MR sequence protocol) to monitor Gd-HP-DO3A release at 12 sec intervals for the entire 20 min post administration of Gd-HTLC, beginning 30 sec prior to injection.\nContour the tumor (heated and unheated) and muscle volumes. Calculate the mean MR signal of all voxels within each contoured volume.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
