    "All experimental procedures described here follow institutional and national guidelines, EU Directives for the Protection of Animals and the Guidelines of the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Association.\n1. Preparation of the Solutions\nStandard artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; Table 1)\nUse high-purity salts 38 and clean glass beakers previously rinsed with double-distilled water to prepare a fresh solution. Use high-quality double-distilled water for the preparation of all extra- and intracellular solutions.\nTake a 2 L beaker to dissolve NaHCO3 in 500 mL water and another to dissolve the other salts in order to prevent precipitation of divalent ions 39 according to Table 1. Clean the spatula systematically with double-distilled water and dry it before taking a salt. Use a magnetic stirrer to homogenize dissolution. Add the solutions from both beakers to an appropriate volumetric flask and bring to the appropriate volume.\nEnsure that the final extracellular solution is fully transparent and without any trace of precipitation.\nApply a gas mixture composed of 95% O2 and 5% CO2 (carbogen gas) with a glass microfilter candle (Ø 13 mm) 20 - 30 min before perfusing the slices 38,40. Carefully control the osmolarity (2 - 3 consecutive measurements) of the ACSF with an osmometer (optimal range: 314 - 325 mOsmol/L). Store the remaining solution after preparation at 4 °C and use it within 3 days.\nCutting solution (sucrose-ACSF; Table 2) 5,13\nPrepare 3 L of fresh solution. Use 1 L to prepare brain slices from one animal. Store the remaining solution at 4 °C and use it within 3 days.\n\t\tNOTE: High Mg2+ and low Ca2+ concentrations are used to decrease synaptic transmission and the substitution of some NaCl with sucrose to preserve the tissue 5,40.\nIntracellular solutions\nPrepare in advance 100 mL solution for dual whole-cell recordings (Table 3).",
    "Include methylsulfate 13,15,21 to obtain good recovery of cell morphology. Add biocytin (0.1 - 0.4%) to examine subsequently the morphology of the neuron. Include a fluorescent dye (e.g., Alexa 594 or Sulforhodamine 101 41) to follow the extension of dendrites during the recording (optional).\nPrepare in advance 100 mL electrode solution for cell-attached recordings (Table 4). In this case the internal solution is a high-K+ solution designed to isolate the macroscopic hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih) and contains blockers for the other voltage-gated ion channels.\nStore intracellular solutions in 2 mL aliquots at -20 °C. Use a new aliquot for every new recording session. Check the osmolarity of every thawed aliquot carefully with an osmometer. Take a new aliquot if the osmolarity does not correspond to the initial value.\nTransfer the solution from the aliquot into a 3 mL syringe on the top of which a 0.22 µm sterile syringe filter is placed. Keep the syringe on ice during the recording session to limit degradation of its compounds (ATP, GTP or phosphocreatine).\n2. Fabrication and Filling of Patch Pipette\nPulling\nUse a horizontal electrode puller and thick-walled borosilicate glass tubing. For whole-cell and cell-attached recordings, use a 2 mm outer diameter/1 mm inner diameter. Ensure that the glass tubing is absolutely clean 38.\nIf this is not the case, immerse glass capillaries in an organic solvent (e.g., ethanol) first and then in double-distilled water. Briefly heat capillary endings with a Bunsen burner. Alternatively, order glass tubing washed and heated directly from the manufacturer (see Materials list).",
    "For dual somatodendritic recordings, ensure that the somatic pipette resistance is between 6 and 10 MΩ 6,11 and between 8 and 19 MΩ for dendritic pipettes when filled with intracellular solution (Table 3). Standardize pipette resistance for cell-attached recordings to a resistance of 10 MΩ to achieve comparable results along the somatodendritic domain of the neuron 16,18,42,43.\nPrepare fresh pipettes before every recording session (every day) or immediately before patching and use them 5 - 8 h after their fabrication 39. Store pipettes in a covered glass container to protect them from dust and obstruction of the tip.\nPolishing\nInspect and heat-polish every pipette tip with a microforge to obtain better seals with the membrane. Before using the microforge, melt a tiny piece of glass on the platinum heating filament. Replace this glass coating on the platinum filament daily for constancy (Peter Jonas, personal communication).\n\t\tNOTE: Pipettes used for cell-attached recordings can be coated before the heat-polishing step to reduce background noise. Coating can be achieved with an insulating agent such as molten dental wax 22,44 or a silicone elastomer39.\n3. Preparation of Brain Slices\nUse healthy Wistar rats aged between 16 - 19 days old. Do not use unhealthy animals or animals suffering from hypothermia or dehydration. Before starting the preparation of slices keep the animal in a safe and silent place. Avoid having any other animal in the room while preparing an animal. Manipulate animals gently.\nPour sucrose-ACSF into two 400 mL polypropylene (PP) beakers and place them in the -80 °C freezer for 45 min. Mix the solution to get a homogenous ice cold liquid/frozen solution and place the beakers on ice. Supply the sucrose-ACSF solution with carbogen gas using a microfilter candle (Ø 13 mm) in each PP beaker.\nPrepare the slicer and the reserve chamber",
    "Use a high-quality tissue slicer with extremely low vertical vibrations 5,38 to minimize damage to the superficial layers of slices as much as possible. Fix a fresh and entire razor blade on the slicer.\nUse a new razor blade for each cutting session. Avoid bending of the razor blade. Do not remove the fatty film at the surface of the razor blade (Josef Bischofberger, personal communication).\nIf available, check the vertical vibration with a vibroprobe provided by the manufacturer. Alternatively, use a custom-made vibroprobe 5. Reduce the vertical vibrations of the blade so as to be as close as possible to 0 µm.\nPrepare a 150 mL reserve chamber 45,46 for slices as depicted on p. 201 in Ref. 39. Pour standard ACSF into the reserve chamber and place it in a water bath. Supply the reserve chamber solution with carbogen using a microfilter candle (Ø 6 mm). Ensure that the carbogen bubbles are as tiny as possible.\n\t\tNOTE: Build a new reserve chamber every 2 - 3 months to keep the slice quality constant.\nCut slices\nIn a silent room in which the experimenter is not disturbed or stressed, decapitate the animal with surgery scissors (length 150 mm) at the level of the cervical medulla.\nCut the skin at the top of the animal's head in the nasal to caudal direction with a scalpel and remove it laterally. Cut the top of the skull from the caudal to the nasal part of the head with fine scissors and remove both parts of the skull laterally. Remove the brain with a thin spatula and drop it carefully into a PP beaker containing ice-cold (0 - 4 °C) sucrose-ACSF equilibrated with carbogen 38.",
    "NOTE: This sequence of steps needs to be done as quickly as possible, but also meticulously (<<1 min, roughly 40 s).\nKeep the brain in the solution of the PP beaker for ~2 to 5 min. Adjust the carbogen pressure to avoid movements of the brain. Replace the microfilter candle if the carbogen bubbles are too large with a fresh one.\nPlace the brain on a 9 cm Petri dish in which the inside bottom is covered with a ~0.5 cm thick Sylgard layer 38. Prepare this petri dish in advance.\nSurround the brain with ice-cold sucrose-ACSF. Ensure that some liquid phase of ACSF-sucrose solution submerges the brain. For coronal slices, cut off the frontal part of the brain in the coronal plane with a scalpel or a razor blade. Remove the cerebellum with a coronal cut.\nApply cyanoacrylate glue on the specimen tray (area ~1 cm2). Paste the brain block such that the frontal part faces the slicing stage. Carefully drip sucrose-ACSF on top of the pasted brain using the large opening of a glass Pasteur pipette and subsequently slowly submerge the cutting chamber of the slicer. Maneuver the specimen tray so that the cutting surface (i.e., the first tissue to hit the blade) is the ventral surface of the brain 40.\nApply carbogen with a bended glass microfilter candle (Ø 6 mm) to the cutting chamber (optional).\nAdjust the razor blade at an angle of ~15° with reference to the horizontal plane 5. Cut coronal brain slices of ~500 µm in the caudal to nasal direction before reaching the substantia nigra. Decrease the thickness to cut 300 - 350 µm thick slices containing the region of interest.",
    "Separate slices from the tissue block with a very thin perfusion needle attached to a syringe parallel to the edge of the razor blade. Bend the needle so as to have an angle of 90° between the needle and the syringe. Ensure that no pressure is applied to the razor blade while removing the slice from the tissue block.\nStore slices\nTransfer the slices using the largest opening of a glass Pasteur pipette (attached to a bulb) into the reserve chamber. Once all the slices are transferred into the reserve chamber (Christoph Schmidt-Hieber, personal communication) bring the temperature of the water bath to 34 °C for 0.5 - 1 h.\nAfter this period switch off the water bath and keep the slices at room temperature. Adjust the carbogen pressure in order to avoid movements of the slices in the reserve chamber. Keep the slices for another 10 to 20 min before starting recordings.\nClean the equipment and the microfilter candles carefully yet thoroughly with double-distilled water at the end of the slicing procedure.\n4. Dual Somatic and Somatodendric Recordings in Nigral Neurons and Biocytin Filing\nFollow descriptions for the assembly of a patch-clamp setup for slices given in The Axon Guide and in Refs. 39,40,47. Information concerning more basic aspects of patching are in Ref. 48.\nPrepare recording chamber\nPlace 1 - 2 mL double-distilled water in the recording chamber. Verify that it is not leaky. Place the recording chamber on the shifting x-y table.\nFeed standard ACSF through an oxygen-impermeable perfusion tubing system (polytetrafluoroethylene) to the recording chamber. Stabilize the perfusion flow in the chamber at a rate of 4 - 5 mL min-1. Keep the length of the tubing joining the beaker containing ACSF and the recording chamber as short as possible (1 m).",
    "Select a brain slice from the reserve chamber and transfer it into the recording chamber using the largest opening of a glass Pasteur pipette. Cover the slice with a platinum ring to anchor it at the bottom of the recording chamber as depicted on p. 201 in Ref. 39. Use a flat platinum ring (Ø 1.5 cm) and glue parallel nylon threads (spacing >2 mm) on it.\nAdjust and optimize the optics\nVisualize the slices using infrared (IR) video microscopy 4,47,49,50. Adjust the Köhler illumination 51 and optimize differential interference contrast (DIC) 51 optics or the oblique illumination (Dodt Gradient contrast - DGC) 52,53. More detail about this procedure are given in Refs. 40,49.\nCheck the quality of the slice. Only keep slices with smooth and even surfaces that are not too strongly contrasted and have only small, dispersed craters.\nFill 2 fresh and unused patch pipettes with intracellular solution (Table 3). Use a 0.5 mL tube containing the pipette solution to fill the tip of the pipette by capillarity action. To accelerate the tip filling of pipettes without filament, apply negative pressure to the end of the pipette using tubing attached to a syringe.\nPosition the pipettes above the surface of the slice\nCheck the presence of chloride coating on the silver wires (bath reference electrode and patch electrode; for details, see The Axon Guide and Refs. 39,54).\nInsert the pipettes sequentially into the pipette holders and apply positive pressure (~70 mbar) using a tubing circuit connecting the pipette holder, a three-way tap and a manometer 40. Lower the pipette into the bath of the recording chamber.\nCheck that the pressure value on the manometer is constant for ~1 - 2 min. If the pressure is decreasing, check the tubing or the sealing O-rings inside the pipette holder.",
    "Place the pipette tip in the middle of the video monitor and ensure that it is not obstructed. Ensure that the pipette tip does not move when applying or releasing pressure to the pipette.\nCheck for drift and vibrations of pipette tip by drawing a small cross at the center of the monitor exactly at the position of the pipette tip and observe for 5 min possible movements of the tip.\nApply a voltage step (5 mV) to monitor the pipette resistance on an oscilloscope. Set the holding potential of the patch-clamp amplifier to 0 mV. Cancel pipette offset potential such that the DC pipette current reads zero at the amplifier meter 39,51.\nMove the pipettes down to the slice and maintain them above the surface.\nSelect and patch a neuron with long dendrites\nWithin the substantia nigra select a healthy neuron with long dendrites that can be followed over a long distance in approximately the same plane (Figure 1A and 1B) using IR-Dodt Gradient Contrast (IR-DGC). Choose a smooth and homogeneous cell body. Avoid the two strongly contrasted cells at the surface of the slice (Figure 1C and 1D), because it is difficult to break in and to preserve stable recording conditions over time (stable series resistance). Select neurons that have their soma 10 - 30 µm underneath the slice surface.\nMove the somatic electrode close to the soma (40 - 50 µm away) and the dendritic electrode close to the dendrite at the same distance. Use a 2X magnification (fourfold changer) to select and patch a portion of a dendrite. Obtain on the monitor an absolute magnification of 2,100X without magnification (1X) and of 5,500X with a 2X  magnification.",
    "Slightly release the pressure of the somatic pipette by 10 mbar. If necessary, regulate dendritic and somatic pipette pressure to avoid displacement of the cell structure (soma and dendrite) within the slice.\nPosition the dendritic pipette close to the membrane in order to see a small dimpling. Release the pressure on the pipette tip and patch the dendrite while controlling the pipette resistance. In ideal conditions, only a very slight suction is sufficient to obtain a good seal.\nKeep the dendritic pipette in the cell-attached mode. Move the somatic pipette close to the somatic membrane and patch the somatic membrane. Ensure that a high seal resistance is obtained before rupturing the cell membrane (> 1 GΩ) 39. Slightly retract both pipettes away from the membrane by a couple of µm to avoid deformation of the cell body and dendrite.\nFor both pipettes, reduce as much as possible the amplitude of the pipette capacitance transients on top of the current step using a voltage pulse with high gain and little filtering 51 and the oscilloscope. Enter into the whole-cell mode with the dendritic pipette and subsequently with the somatic pipette.\nEliminate the whole-cell capacitance transients and compensate for series resistance. Monitor and document the access resistance at the beginning of, and regularly during, the experiment. If series resistance is too high (>50 MΩ), retry with another pipette.\nCollect IR-DGC pictures (Figure 1A and 1B) with a video graphic printer 25, a frame grabber or a digital camera at high and low magnifications.\n\t\tNOTE: Swelling of neurons during recording (Figure 1E and 1F) is sporadically observed, but rarely when the osmolarity and pH of solutions is correctly adjusted 39.\nObtain double somatic whole-cell recordings (soma - soma) with the same procedure (Figure 2A).",
    "Apply long (several hundreds of ms) increasing depolarizing current steps sequentially with the somatic and dendritic pipette to evoke APs (Figures 2B, 3C and 3D). Record the resulting potential at the dendritic and somatic pipette simultaneously.\nExamine the propagation of artificial excitatory postsynaptic potentials (aEPSPs) in dopaminergic neurons\nCreate an excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) waveform to inject as a current command during dual current-clamp recordings (Figures 4A and 4B). To do this, build a double exponential function with amplitude and time course values corresponding to real values measured for EPSCs in the neuron of interest 55. Carefully control the sampling rates of the constructed EPSC and of the injected EPSC waveform to preserve the original time course.\n\t\tNote: Before applying the waveform in a real neuron, test it using a model cell.\nSequentially inject the waveform via the dendritic and somatic pipette and record resulting potentials for both somatic and dendritic pipettes concomitantly. Check regularly for possible drift of pipettes.\nTerminating the recording from a neuron\nTake an IR-DGC picture at a low magnification (objective: 5X or 10X) to document the position of the neuron within the slice and the electrodes.\nSlowly and gently withdraw the dendritic and the somatic pipettes from the neuronal membrane sequentially in order to form outside-out patches with both pipettes. Remove the pipette using a sequence of lateral-upward movements 38. These should be short at first and then gradually increase in length. This recording configuration favors the proper closing of the cell membrane.\nMonitor the decrease of capacitive currents (increase in the access resistance) in response to a 5 mV voltage pulse in voltage-clamp while withdrawing the pipette.",
    "Once the membrane is sealed around the pipette tip, take it completely out of the recording chamber. Remove the objective from the bath. Keep the slice in the recording chamber for 15 - 20 min in standard ACSF to allow equilibration of biocytin (from the intracellular solution) in the recorded neuron.\nGently transfer the slice using the large opening of a Pasteur pipette into a 25 mL wide mouth amber (brown) glass bottle containing standard ACSF. Close the bottle with a cap. See paragraph 6 for the fixation step.\n5. Cell-attached Recordings\nSelect a neuron with a dendrite extending over a long distance in the same plane. Ensure that the dendrite of interest can be followed to a well-defined soma.\nFill the patch pipette with electrode solution (Table 4). Design the solution to record the current of interest in the cell-attached configuration by including specific pharmacological agents to block other ion channels.\nPatch the dendrite in the cell-attached mode\nVisualize a portion of the dendrite and approach the recoding pipette using the manipulator. Adapt the pressure at the pipette tip by checking the manometer (70 - 80 mbar) to avoid displacement of the dendrite. Patch the dendrite as described in 4.5.4.\nRecord some IR-DGC pictures (Figure 5A). Try to obtain a seal resistance as large as possible (>1 GΩ 39), at best between 3 - 10 GΩ for cell-attached recordings 18 (Figure 5B). Retract the pipette away from the membrane by a couple of µm to avoid deformation of the dendrite.\nObserve action currents in the cell-attached mode reflecting spontaneous action potentials of nigral neurons. Supplement the ACSF with Ca2+ and Na+ channel blockers (CdCl2 and TTX, respectively) to suppress action currents.",
    "Apply a 2 s voltage step of -90 mV from a holding potential of 0 mV to the patch to evoke Ih (Figure 5C). Keep in mind that the pipette potential and the resting membrane potential are in series in the cell-attached configuration 56. For more details, see The Axon guide and Ref. 39.\nCheck regularly for possible drift of the pipette.\nAt the end of the recording, rupture the patch to go in the whole-cell mode and immediately take a readout of the membrane potential. Retract the pipette as described in sections 4.8.2 and 4.8.3 to obtain an outside-out patch.\nRecord from the corresponding soma in the whole-cell mode\nLook along the dendrite and locate the corresponding soma. Use a high-resistance pipette (5 - 10 MΩ) 6,14,57 filled with a K+-based intracellular solution (Table 3). Apply a brief suction (negative pressure) to the pipette tip to rupture the membrane in order to enter in the whole-cell mode.\nCheck for the identity of the neuron in current-clamp by applying long hyper- and depolarizing current steps (Figure 5D) and allow biocytin to diffuse along dendrites. Apply short depolarizing current steps to visualize the AP time course.\nAfter ≤10 min, withdraw the pipette to obtain an outside-out patch as described in sections 4.8.2 - 4.8.3. Gently transfer the slice using the large opening of a Pasteur pipette into a 25 mL amber glass bottle containing standard ACSF. Close the bottle with a cap.\nAlternatively, first obtain a somatic whole-cell with a pipette solution containing additionally a fluorescent dye. Allow the diffusion of the dye and select a portion of a dendrite 26. With a second pipette, patch the dendrite in the cell-attached mode. Use a confocal microscope if available to improve the visualization of the fluorescently labeled dendrite 14,22.",
    "Perform dendritic recordings in the outside-out configuration, alternatively or additionally to the cell-attached recordings 10,22. See an example of a voltage-gated currents recorded from an outside-out patch in Figure 5E and 5F.\n6. Biocytin Labeling of Nigral Neurons\nFixation of the tissue\nIf possible, use separate rooms for slice recording/histochemical processing38.\nFix the slices by replacing the ACSF with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH = 7.4) with a Pasteur pipette. Always use freshly prepared fixative solution (<< 1 week old).\n\t\tCAUTION: Use appropriate hand gloves and a chemical hood placed in a histology laboratory to manipulate paraformaldehyde because of its toxicity. Read the safety data sheet of this dangerous product before use and check the regulations concerning chemical safety (Dangerous Substances Directive (67/548/EEC) from the EU Commission) as this powder is thought to induce cancer. Other details are in Ref. 58.\nPlace the slices at 4 °C overnight. Avoid contamination of the patch-clamp setup or any equipment used for electrophysiology by paraformaldehyde.\nAfter fixation, replace the fixative solution with PBS. Use a different Pasteur pipettes for removing the fixative solution and applying the PBS. Store slices in PBS at 4 °C before further processing (1 - 2 weeks). In this case, replace PBS twice a week. Use always freshly prepared PBS (<< 1 week old).\nStaining of the tissue\nPrepare a 24 well cell culture plate for the staining steps. Use clean equipment to transfer slices. Rinse the slices 3 x 5 min using fresh PBS.",
    "Apply Fluorescein Avidin DCS (Avidin D, cell sorter grade; 1 µL fluorescein / mL Triton X-100) and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS at 4 °C overnight. Protect the slices from light throughout the staining. As an alternative to fluorescence, label neurons via 3,3'-diaminobenzidine for light or electron microscopic analysis 21,58.\n\t\tCAUTION: Triton X-100 is dangerous. Read safety data sheet and EU Commission Directives before using this substance.\nRinse 3 x 30 min with PBS and subsequently with PB (phosphate buffer, to avoid the formation of crystals at the surface of the slice).\nMount the slices on standard glass slides. Cover the slices carefully with an embedding medium. Avoid air bubbles in the embedding medium. Put the coverslip gently in order to cover completely the slice. Air-dry the slides overnight before visualizing them with a microscope.\nStore the labeled slices at 4 °C after visualization. Useful tricks on histochemical procedures are in Refs. 58,59.\nClean the equipment used for histology and electrophysiology separately. Do not mix histology and electrophysiology equipment together.\n7. Post Hoc Visualization of Biocytin-filled Neurons\nUse a confocal microscope to visualize the morphology of recovered neurons.\n\t\nRoughly locate the fluorescently labeled neuron in the slice with epifluorescence. Examine the dendritic arbor of neurons and locate the axon and axonal bleb (2 - 4 µm Ø) using a 10x or 20x objective. Document the course of the axon.\nSwitch to the confocal microscope and select the 488 nm laser diode to excite the fluorescein contained in the labeled neuron. Follow the extension of the axon and dendrites in the z-axis.",
    "Record successive images in order to obtain a z-stack for the entire cell. Adjust the resolution of the z-axis (distance between consecutive images) to 0.5 - 1 µm. Collect confocal images of a cell using low (10X objective) and high (60X objective, oil-immersion) magnification.\nOpen the image file of the neuron obtained with the confocal microscope with an imaging software (ImageJ) 60. Compare the z-projection image with an IR-DGC image by eye to locate the precise position of the patch pipettes during the electrophysiological recording (Figures 1, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A and 5E).\nDetermine morphometries of labeled neurons: measure the axon - soma distance, distances between recording pipettes along the somatodendritic domain and between the dendritic pipette and axon using the \"Measure\" function in ImageJ.\nReconstruct some neurons with NeuronJ (ImageJ), Imaris29 or Neuromantic 61.\n8. Analysis of Electrophysiological Data\nUse the software package associated with the amplifier to grossly analyze the data (e.g., Clampfit) or directly another software for data analysis such as Stimfit, an open source software 62,63 as in our recent publication 13 or for example WinWCP."
