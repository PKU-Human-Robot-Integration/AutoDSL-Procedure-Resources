    "1. Microfluidic Device Fabrication\nUsing standard photolithographic techniques, fabricate the master mold wafer in a class 1,000 clean room. Pattern the first 3-µm-thin epoxy-based negative photoresist layer to define the migration channels according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Pattern the second 50-µm-thick layer to define the cell-loading and chemokine chambers.\nUse the patterned wafer to cast polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) devices. Vigorously mix PDMS (20 g) with initiator (2 g) for 5 min using plastic fork in large plastic weighing tray.\nCarefully pour PDMS onto mold.\nDegas the PDMS by placing mold with poured PDMS in a vacuum desiccator for 1 hr.\nBake and cure PDMS microfluidic devices for at least 3 hr in an oven set to 65 °C.\nPunch out the central WBLCs using a puncher with a tip diameter of 1.5 mm.\nPunch out whole donut-shaped devices using a puncher with a tip diameter of 5.0 mm.\nRemove particles from donut devices using adhesive tape.\nRinse a 12-well plate with deionized water and then dry with nitrogen. Place plate in 60 °C oven for 5 min.\nOxygen plasma treat the 12-well plate twice; once alone for 35 sec and then again with the donut devices for another 35 sec.\nCarefully place devices in the wells of the plate using tweezers.\nBake plate with bonded devices on a hot plate set to 80 °C for 10 min.\n2. Microfluidic Assay Preparation\nPrime microfluidic devices immediately after oxygen plasma treatment, when the device is hydrophilic and capillary effects can promote the priming of the small channels in the device.\nCreate chemoattractant solution by mixing 5 µl fMLP [stock solution 10 µM] with 5 µl fibronectin [stock solution 1 mg/ml] and 490 µl HBSS.",
    "Slowly pipet chemoattractant solution into WBLC, using a gel loading tip (Figure 1A). Pipet an additional 20 µl of the chemoattractant around the outside of the device.\nPlace plate in a desiccator for 15 min. By applying a vacuum to the device, the solution is instilled into the side-channels of the device and the displaced air diffused out through the PDMS.\nRemove plate from desiccator and confirm wetting of device channel under microscope. Watch as bubble becomes smaller as chemoattractant solution enters the chamber. No bubble should be present within the device after vacuum treatment.\nWash the WBLC and outside of the device thoroughly to remove excess chemoattractant solution. This step generates a gradient of chemoattractant from each of the focal chemotactic chambers (FCCs) to the device center.\n\t\nFill a 1-ml syringe with PBS, add a 30 G blunt needle tip to syringe. Gently, insert the needle tip of the syringe into the center of the donut hole. Gently push 100 µl of PBS into the hole so that a droplet of PBS forms on top of the device.\nTilt plate and pipette 1 ml of PBS around device so that the liquid collects at the bottom of the well. Aspirate the liquid and repeat process for total of 3x using fresh buffer solution (use media instead of buffer if the separated neutrophils will be loaded in media)9.\nFill each well with media until the tops of the devices are submerged under liquid. Let the devices sit for 15 min to allow gradient to stabilize. Experimental results and theoretical data from finite element simulations show that the gradients in these devices are stable up to 24 hr for small molecules (e.g., fMLP) and up to a several days for larger molecular weight (e.g., IL8).",
    "Using gel loading tips, slowly pipette 2 µl of blood (or isolated neutrophils) into each whole blood loading chamber (WBLC) (Figure 1A).\n3. Sample Preparation\nHuman Neutrophils From Capillary Blood\nCollect capillary blood from finger prick of healthy volunteer, who is on no immunosuppressants. All patient samples were obtained with written informed consent, and through procedures approved by the MGH and Shriners Institutional Review Boards.\n\t\nFor finger prick blood collection, wash hands with water and soap and dry the skin. Prepare anti-coagulant/stain stock solution by adding 1 ml HBSS + 0.2% HSA and 10 µl Hoechst stain (32.4 μM) to heparin blood collection tube (1.65 USP/50 µl blood). Prick the finger using a SurgiLance safety lancet (2.2-mm depth, 22 G), wipe away first drop of blood and collect 50 µl of blood in Eppendorf tube containing the stock anti-coagulant and Hoechst fluorescent stain solution (10 µl) and gently mix.\nIncubate the blood and Hoechst stain for 10 min to allow for nucleus fluorescent staining. Run sample within 1 hr of blood collection.\nHuman Neutrophils From Venous Blood\nDraw 10 ml of peripheral, venous blood into tubes containing 33 USP heparin.\nAdd 50 µl of venous blood to media and Hoechst stain as previously described. Incubate the blood and Hoechst stain for 10 min to allow for nucleus fluorescent staining. Run sample within 1 hr of blood collection.\nNeutrophil Separation From Whole Blood - Positive Control\nTo separate neutrophils, use sterile techniques to isolate neutrophils from the 10 ml venous whole blood sample using Hetastarch (6% w/v) density gradient followed by a negative selection magnetic bead isolation kit following the manufacturers protocol.",
    "Resuspended the final aliquot of neutrophils at a concentration of 4,000 cells/µl in 1X HBSS + 0.2% human serum albumin. Keep cells at 37 °C until ready to run the experiment.\n4. Microscopy and Image Analysis for Neutrophil Chemotaxis Measurements\nSet up biochamber temperature to 37 °C, humidity at 80%, and CO2 at 5%.\nStart imaging immediately using time-lapse imaging on a microscope (10X or higher magnification).\n5. Statistical Analysis\nManually track at least 50 neutrophils in each sample.\nCount the cells entering the FCC over time (Figure 2).\nCalculate neutrophil velocities in the channel between WBLC and FCC using ImageJ (NIH) (Figure 2).\nQuantify directionality of neutrophils by counting the number of cells that pass the bifurcation and calculating the ratio between the number of cells that turn toward the FCC and cells that exit the device. Cells that are not directional do not follow the chemotactic gradient and therefore migrate in equal numbers toward the FCC and the exit channel (Figure 2).\nSubscription Required.
