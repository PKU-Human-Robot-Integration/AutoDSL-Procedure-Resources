    "All mouse protocols were in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by the Animal Studies Committee of Washington University School of Medicine (St. Louis, MO).\n1. Preparing the Testing Plate and Enclosures\nClean off the glass surface.\nSecure the T-type filament thermocouple probe to the surface in the middle of the glass plate with laboratory tape.\nPlace the animal enclosures on the glass plate in a single line along the middle of the plate.\nThread the thermocouple probe through the center animal enclosure and plug into the data logger. Turn the data logger on while deactivating the auto-shutdown feature, and attach the data logger to the computer with the provided cable.\n\t\nIf recording the plate temperature during the experiment, open the data logger software to begin recording plate temperatures.\nIf necessary, adjust the software to record the plate temperature once every second.\nBegin recording temperatures using the software packaged with the thermal data logger.\nSeparate the enclosure with black inserts to prevent visual interaction between mice.\nPosition mirrors underneath the glass such that the underside of the enclosures is visible from a comfortable seated position.\n2. Warming/Cooling the Glass Plate\nFill aluminum boxes with warmed water, wet ice, or dry ice and position them appropriately on the glass plate (aluminum foil packets filled with dry ice can also be used to cool the glass; Figure 1)2.\n\t\nFor testing at 30 °C, position the aluminum boxes approximately 0.25’’ away from the animal enclosures (Figure 2B)2.\n\t\t\nSet a heated water circulator on either side of the glass plate. Set the circulator to 45 - 60 °C, and use it to fill the aluminum boxes with a steady stream of hot water (Figure 1C)2.",
    "Position the circulators such that the hot water from the aluminum boxes drains directly back into the reservoir of the circulator on each side (Figure 1C)2.\nFor testing at RT, leave the boxes empty (Figure 2)2.\nFor testing at 17 °C, position the boxes approximately 0.25’’ away from the animal enclosures on either side and fill with wet ice (Figure 2)2.\nFor testing at 12 °C, position the boxes approximately 1.25’’ away from the enclosures on either side and fill with dry ice (Figure 2)2.\nFor testing at 5 °C, position the boxes approximately 0.25’’ away from the enclosures on either side and fill with dry ice (Figure 2)2.\n\t\t\nWhen cooling the glass with dry ice, make sure there is sufficient ventilation to prevent CO2 buildup in the room.\nWait for the glass to reach the desired temperature range.\nAdd the mice to the enclosures on the plate.\n\tNOTE: A white noise generator may be used to decrease noise disturbances.\nWait for the mice to acclimate.\n\tNOTE: In our facility this takes roughly 2.5 hr, but this may vary significantly based on animal housing and handling conditions.\nMaintain the glass at the desired temperature range by ensuring that the boxes are kept full of warmed water, wet ice, or dry ice.\n\tNOTE: With our apparatus the boxes need to be refilled with ice roughly every 90 min.\n\tNOTE: For the 17 °C condition, it is helpful to empty most of the water from the aluminum boxes through the drain holes before refilling it with ice. This will stabilize the temperature better, and prevent overflow\n\tNOTE: The exact amount of the dry ice will vary seasonally, but in general keeping the boxes more than ¼ full along the entire length of the box will keep the temperature constant.",
    "3. Testing the Mice at Fixed Temperatures\nOutside of the behavioral room, fill an ice bucket about half full of dry ice.\nUsing a hammer or mallet, crush the dry ice into a fine powder.\n\tNOTE: Overfilling the bucket will make it difficult to fully crush the dry ice into powder.\nUsing a straight razor blade or scissors, cut the top off a 3 ml syringe.\nUsing a 21 G needle, poke 3 holes on opposing sides of the syringe (total of 6 holes).\n\tNOTE: These holes will decrease the pressure generated by sublimation while compressing the dry ice. The cut-off syringe can be reused for multiple experiments.\nTake the syringe, dry ice powder, and a hand-held stopwatch into the behavioral room.\nFill the syringe chamber half full of dry ice powder. Hold the cut end of the syringe against a flat object, and firmly compress the powder using the plunger. Be careful; the plastic plunger may bend or break from the pressure. If this happens, replace the plunger from a new syringe.\nExtend the tip of the compressed dry ice pellet past the edge of the syringe.\nTest mice that are fully at rest.\n\t\nAt 30 °C, 23 °C and 17 °C, test mice that have all 4 paws on the glass and not moving, but not fully asleep19.\nAt 12 °C and 5 °C, test mice that are on 2 paws or 4 paws and not moving or jumping.\nUsing the mirrors for targeting, gently but firmly press the flat pellet flush against the glass surface underneath the mouse hindpaw (Figure 1A)2. Start the hand-timer.\nStop the timer and remove the pellet when the mouse moves away from the cooled glass.\n\tNOTE: The withdrawal movement can be vertical or horizontal.",
    "If the mouse very briefly moves the paw and then returns it to the cooling surface, continue timing and stimulating until the mouse makes a permanent move away.\n\t\tNOTE: Our lab uses a maximum stimulus time of 20 sec for mice in the majority of cases.\nRepeat this testing procedure until at least 3 values on each paw of each animal are collected. Separate trials testing opposite paws on the same mouse by at least 7 min, and separate consecutive trials on any single paw by at least 15 min.\nIf needed, use different thicknesses of glass to generate different rates of cooling (Figure 3)1.\n\tNOTE: The rate of cooling is inversely correlated with the thickness of the glass.\n4. Testing the Mice During Cold Adaptation\nNOTE: This is an alternate protocol which allows testing as the glass plate cools, rather than once the plate has stabilized and the mice have fully adapted to the cold environment.\nFollow the instructions listed in Section 1 to set up the apparatus.\nFollow the instructions listed in Section 3 to take baseline measurements at RT (Figure 7A)2.\nPre-cool the aluminum boxes with dry ice.\nOnce baseline withdrawal latencies have been measured, position the precooled boxes on the plate approximately 1.25’’ away from the enclosures on either side (Figure 7A, arrow labeled “Dry ice added”) 2.\nFollow the instructions listed in Section 3 to take measurements as the glass plate cools, taking measurements as often as possible.\nSubscription Required.
