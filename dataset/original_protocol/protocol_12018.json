    "In this protocol, the anterior hind limb muscles of adult mice (2-6 months), tibialis anterior (TA) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL), were employed as an example to perform the immunofluorescence staining on their SCs. All the steps handling mice and muscle tissue dissections have been approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) of NIAMS/NIH.\n1. Dissect the TA/EDL Muscle from the Mouse Hind Limb\nEuthanize the mouse in a CO2 filled euthanasia chamber under the guidelines of the ACUC of the NIH. Perform cervical dislocation if needed.\nPut the mouse face-up on a dissection pad (supine). Spray 70% ethanol onto its belly skin. Cut a 1-2 cm opening horizontally on the center of the mouse belly skin, then deskin the mouse by pulling the opening toward the mouse feet. Expose one side of the mouse hind limb.\nUse two sharp forceps: use one to hold the tendons that attach the TA/EDL to the ankle, and use the other one to break and shear the fascia covering the TA/EDL. Once the fascia is peeled off, use the sharp tip of the forceps to detach the TA/EDL from the tibia bone by running the tip underneath the TA/EDL muscle.\nCut off the ankle tendons with scissors while still holding them with the forceps. Trim the muscle with scissors along the longitudinal line of the TA/EDL from the ankle to the knee while lifting the TA/EDL from the ankle side with the forceps. Cut the knee-side tendons to detach the whole TA/EDL from the tibia.\n2. Cryo-embedding of the TA/EDL Muscle",
    "Prepare a liquid nitrogen bath in a container, e.g., a liquid nitrogen Dewar flask. Pour methylbutane into a small plastic beaker (about 20 mL) to half-full. Then put the beaker in the liquid nitrogen bath to freeze it. After a few minutes, check that the methylbutane is frozen.\n\tNOTE: The liquid nitrogen can be replaced by a bucket of dry ice, but the freezing time is slower.\nLay the dissected TA/EDL onto the flat surface of a small plastic syringe plunger. Fully cover the TA/EDL with a few drops of Optimal Cutting Temperature (O.C.T.) compound (the freezing medium).\nTake the methylbutane beaker out of the liquid nitrogen bath and thaw the surface with a warm object (e.g., the handle of scissors). Quickly dip the O.C.T. covered TA/EDL on the plunger into the melted methylbutane to snap-freeze the tissue.\nDetach the embedded tissue from the plunger with forceps, and put it into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Place the tube into liquid nitrogen to store it while handling more samples.\n\tNOTE: The embedded tissue can be stored at -80 °C for long term (2 years) or -20 °C for short term (6 months).\n3. Cryostat Sectioning\nAdd a drop of O.C.T. compound onto the center of a specimen holder of a cryostat. Wait until the O.C.T. compound is almost solidified. Quickly stick the embedded TA/EDL to the O.C.T. compound, perpendicularly with the ankle-side down and the knee-side up.\nMount the specimen holder onto a cryostat, cut the tissue at 10 µm interval, and collect the cryo-sections on frost coated slides with about 4-8 sections on one slide.\nDry the sections at room temperature for at least 3 h to overnight.",
    "NOTE: Although drying the sections in the freezer for overnight or longer is acceptable, it will inevitably increase the autofluorescence. For best results, dry the sections for 0.5 h, then proceed with the fixation and staining steps immediately.\nCollect the slides in a slide box and use them immediately, or store the slides at -80 °C or -20 °C for later use.\n4. Preparation of Reagents for Immunofluorescence Staining\nPrepare buffers:\nPrepare 2 L of 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) from 10x PBS.\nPrepare 40 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 1x PBS from 16% PFA.\nPrepare 2 L of PBST: 1x PBS with 0.1% Triton-100.\nPrepare 50 mL of PBST-B: PBST with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA).\nPrepare 10 mL of PBST-B-G: PBST with 2% BSA and 5% Normal Goat Serum.\nPrepare 1 mL of Blocking solution. Dilute AffiniPure Fab Fragment Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) (1:10) in PBST-B.\nPrepare 200 mL of 1x citrate buffer.\n\t\tNOTE: The volumes of solutions above are sufficient for at least 5 slides. Volumes should be adjusted according to the number of slides and the size of the slide containers.\nPrepare antibody stains:\nPrimary Antibodies (working concentration): Prepare 1.2 mL of primary antibody mix by diluting Pax7 monoclonal mouse antibody (IgG1) (1-5 µg/mL) + Laminin polyclonal rabbit antibody (0.5-2 µg/mL) + MF20 monoclonal mouse antibody (IgG2b) (0.5-2.5 µg/mL) in PBST-B-G.\n\t\tNOTE: MF20 monoclonal mouse antibody (IgG2b) is optional.\nSecondary Antibodies (working concentration): Prepare 1.2 mL of secondary antibody mix by diluting Goat anti-Mouse IgG1 cross-adsorbed secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 488 (0.5-2 µg/mL) + Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) highly cross-adsorbed secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor Plus 555 (0.5-2 µg/mL) + Goat anti-Mouse IgG2b cross-adsorbed secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 647 (0.5-2 µg/mL) in PBST-B-G.\n\t\tNOTE: Alexa Fluor 647 is optional.\n5. Immunofluorescence Staining Steps",
    "Rehydrate and fix the cryo-sections with PFA.\nRemove a few of the TA/EDL cryo-section slides from the slide box. Warm the slides in a slide-holding tray at room temperature.\nUse a liquid blocker pen (PAP pen) to draw an area that includes all the cryo-sections on the slide. This circle will prevent the solutions from flowing off the slide.\nTake the tray to a laboratory fume hood. Add 300-500 µL of 4% PFA onto the slide within the circled area to fix the sections at room temperature for 10 min. Wash out the PFA with 1x PBS at least 3x 5 min in a slide container.\n\t\tCAUTION: PFA is toxic and a hazardous waste; it should be operated with care and disposed into a hazardous waste container.\nAntigen retrieval\nFill another slide container with 200 mL of citrate buffer.\nTransfer the slides into the container. Transfer the container with the slides to a pressure cooker to cook the slides in high pressure mode for 10 min.\nCool down the container with draining water for 10 min. Transfer all slides to a new container with PBST (200 mL), rinse the slides with PBST for at least 3x 5 min.\nBlocking\nAdd water-soaked kimwipes to the tray holding the slides to create a moist environment to avoid drying of the slides.\nMove the slides back to the tray, and add 200 µL of blocking solution onto each slide. Cover the tray with a cap and let the blocking develop for 30 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Pax7 antibody is a mouse monoclonal antibody, so there is unspecific binding of mouse IgG in mouse muscle tissues that creates high background. Using the AffiniPure Fab Fragment Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) blocks the mouse-on-mouse unspecific binding.\nApply primary antibodies.",
    "Rinse the slides with PBST once in the slide container. Then move the slides back to the staining tray.\nApply 200 µL of primary antibody mix on each slide, cover the tray with a cap, and let the reaction develop at room temperature for 1 h or at 4 °C for overnight.\n\t\tNOTE: The overnight reaction at 4 °C gives the best result, although developing the reaction at room temperature gives satisfactory results. The myosin MF20 antibody can be added in the mix to perform a triple (Pax7, Laminin, MF20) labeling. MF20 stains differentiated muscle fibers. This step also serves as another blocking step with PBST-B-G to reduce potential unspecific binding from secondary antibodies (goat antibodies) in the following step.\nApply secondary antibodies.\nWash out the primary antibodies with PBST at room temperature at least 3x 5 min.\nAdd 200 µL of secondary antibody mix to each slide, and allow the reaction to develop at room temperature for at least 1 h.\n\t\tNOTE: For Pax7+Laminin, use Goat Anti-Mouse IgG1 Alexa 488 and Goat Anti-Rabbit Alexa 555.\n\t\tFor Pax7+Laminin+MF20, add Goat Anti-Mouse IgG2b Alexa 647 in the mix.\nWash out the secondary antibodies with PBST at least 3x 5min.\nDAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) counter-stain and mounting\nDilute DAPI (1:20,000) in PBST in the slide container, e.g., 10 µL of DAPI in 200 mL of PBST.\nStain the slides in the DAPI container for 3 min.\nWash out the DAPI with PBST for at least 5x 5 min.\nMount the slides with mounting medium. Cover the slides with coverslips.\n\t\tCAUTION: DAPI is toxic and hazardous; it should be handled with care and disposed in the hazardous waste bottle.\n6. Fluorescent Microscopy",
    "NOTE: The immunofluorescent staining protocol reported above will allow SCs visualization with either a wide-field fluorescent or confocal microscope. It may be initially challenging to identify SCs. Here are a few recommended steps that may be of help.\nUse the DAPI channel and low magnification objectives to visualize the sections on the slides.\nSwitch the magnification from low to high. To observe SCs, at least a 20X objective is required).\nUse the dual filter cube for 488 (FITC)/555 (Rhodamine) to observe both Pax7 and Laminin signals at the same time to identify SCs. Under this setting, the signal of Pax7 staining has a better contrast to the background noise.\nQuickly alternate the channel from FITC to DAPI to correctly identify SCs. All SCs should be Pax7/DAPI-positive.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
