    "Ex vivo culture of human hair follicles to investigate circadian gene expression:Human studies must be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by institutional review boards.Recruit subjects and obtain informed consent from each subject or the subject's family.(Optional) Although dependent on research aim, volunteers may be asked to follow a set schedule for one or several weeks. For example, wake-up time and meal times may be set based on the lifestyle habits of each volunteer. They may also be asked to refrain from consuming excess alcohol and snacks and taking long naps. Individual chronotypes can be assessed using the morningness-eveningness questionnaire (MEQ) or the Munich chronotype questionnaire (MCTQ) (Zavada et al., 2005).Prepare infection medium (see Recipes) by adding an adenovirus carrying the luciferase gene driven by circadian promoter/enhancer elements to fresh DMEM at a 1:20 dilution. The titer of our adenovirus stocks is within a range of 1.24 x 109-1.47 x 109 infectious units/ml. The use of adenovirus vectors carrying Per3-luc may be recommended (see the following note for this reason). For vector construction, we used the ViraPower Adenoviral Gateway Expression Kit (Yamaguchi et al., 2017). Briefly, together with the luciferase gene, the transcription-regulatory region of a clock gene was subcloned into the pENTR-1A entry vector and subsequently introduced into the pAd/PL-DEST vector using LR recombination.Note: We previously compared period length, robustness and standard deviation (SD) among three adenovirus vectors carrying Bmal1-luc, Per2-luc and Per3-luc (Yamaguchi et al., 2017). Although the average period length was almost identical among the three vectors, the SD of the period length of Per3 was consistently smaller than that of the others. Additionally, the period length of Per3 was the most robust at the smallest SD values. We therefore preferably used the adenovirus vector carrying Per3-luc in our experimental conditions.",
    "Before sampling hair follicles, prepare sterile sampling tubes containing 80 μl of pre-incubation medium, rinse medium or infection medium (see Recipes for the composition of each medium). One tube containing the respective medium is required per hair follicle. Pre-warm and maintain medium at 36.5 °C using a block incubator.(Optional) On cold winter days, warming the carotid arteries by attaching pocket warmers to both sides of the neck may improve the success rate of hair follicle sampling.As shown in Figure 1, collect several strands of scalp (or facial) hair by firmly holding and pulling individual strands of hair by the root using non-slip tweezers (for cosmetic use). To avoid hair follicle cell death by drying, quickly immerse the hair follicle cells into pre-warmed pre-incubation medium without removing the hair shaft. Keep samples at 36.5 °C until the next step (infection: Step 11). Although hair collection does not necessarily require a sterile environment, procedures after Step 11 are recommended to be performed under sterile conditions.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200603/20200603021824_3128.jpgFigure 1. Collection of strands of scalp hair. A. Firmly hold and pull individual strands of hair by the root using non-slip tweezers. B. Use plucked hairs whose root surface is mostly or fully covered with hair follicle cells. C. Quickly immerse hair follicle cells in pre-warmed pre-incubation medium without removing the hair shaft.Cut the hair shaft, leaving about 10 to 20 mm.To obtain a strong bioluminescence signal, use plucked scalp (or facial) hairs whose root surface is mostly or fully covered with hair follicle cells. A representative image showing successful infection of an adenovirus carrying Per2-luc to a hair root mostly covered with hair follicle cells is shown in our original paper (Figure 1B, Yamaguchi et al., 2017).",
    "We previously investigated the effect of differences in hair stage on circadian period length and found no significant differences in period length among stages (Yamaguchi et al., 2017).(Optional) In the case of out-of-lab sampling, maintain samples in a keep-warm bag without CO2 during transport to the laboratory. We confirmed that shipping duration up to approximately 10 h had no obvious effect on the circadian period length of clock gene expression.Inside a laminar flow cabinet, use sterilized tweezers to pick up the hair shaft, immerse the hair follicles into pre-warmed rinse medium, and transfer and completely immerse the follicles into pre-warmed infection medium on a block incubator (36.5 °C). Procedures using adenoviruses must be performed inside P2 areas. Autoclave and discard any infectious wastes.Close the lid of tubes and incubate them for 24 h at 36.5 °C with 5% CO2.The next day, prepare sterile sampling tubes containing pre-warmed rinse medium (at 36.5 °C) for the removal of viruses. Two tubes are required for washing twice.Syringe and push out silicone into a mound on the bottom of 35 mm culture dishes (Figure 2 and Video 1). Place the silicone somewhat off-center to facilitate locating the hair follicle at the center of the culture dish because reducing the distance between a PMT surface and infected cells enhances bioluminescence counts. Use one dish per hair follicle. Sterilization of silicone is not essential, but we recommend using silicone from an unopened packet designated for culture use. In addition, prepare and pre-warm luciferin-containing medium (see Recipes for the composition of each medium) at a concentration of 0.1 mM.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Placing silicone in a mound on the bottom of the culture dishes Use sterile tweezers to pick up the hair by the shaft and transfer the infected hair follicles into 80 μl of pre-warmed rinse medium.",
    "After one-minute incubation, again transfer infected hair follicles into the same volume of fresh rinse medium and incubate them for the same duration to remove adenoviruses as completely as possible.Transfer the hair follicle to the silicone mound in a 35 mm culture dish for bioluminescence monitoring (Video 2). To avoid floating during measurement, push the hair shaft into the silicone so that the shaft is stuck to the silicone and is fixed on the bottom of the dish (Figure 2). Position the hair follicle near to the center of the dish for efficient bioluminescence detection.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Transferring a hair follicle to a silicone mound Completely cover the immobilized hair follicle with 2-3 ml pre-warmed luciferin-containing medium.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200603/20200603021854_8137.jpgFigure 2. Fixing a hair follicle to the bottom of a culture dish. A. Transfer a hair follicle to a silicone mound in a 35 mm culture dish. Push the hair shaft into the silicone so that the shaft is stuck to the silicone and is fixed to the bottom of the dish. B. Position the hair follicle near to the center of the dish.As shown in Figure 3, measure bioluminescence in real-time using a photomultiplier tube inside a dark box specifically designed to reduce background noise to detect ultra-weak photon emissions ( LM2400  , Hamamatsu, Japan) or a luminescence microscope optimized for single-cell imaging (Olympus, Japan) at 35 °C with 5% CO2. To avoid rust formation, the  LM2400  is located inside a CO2 culture incubator under low humidity conditions. To prevent the culture medium from drying out, instead of using the water tray from the CO2 incubator, use the one inside the  LM2400  . Use a CO2 incubator that utilizes an infrared sensor that is not affected by humidity inside the chamber.",
    "For measurement, open the top of the  LM2400  and simply place culture dishes on the metal tray. Culture dishes without hair follicles should provide reads of 5,000-10,000 counts per minute (background control). In successful cases, bioluminescence from the hair follicles should be greater than the background counts and show circadian oscillation over more than four to five days.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200603/20200603021921_9938.jpgFigure 3. Monitoring bioluminescence in real time. Bioluminescence can be measured in real time using a photomultiplier tube (top three panels,  LM2400  ) or a luminescence microscope optimized for single-cell imaging (bottom three panels,  LV200  ) at 35 to 36.5 °C with 5% CO2.
