    "Measurement of cell concentration by optical density (OD600 nm)   Streak out Escherichia coli COB583 wildtype and the rpoS deletion mutant (COB583ΔrpoS) from the stock culture kept in the -80 °C freezer onto LB agar (see Recipes) around a Bunsen burner and incubate them overnight (~16 h) at 37 °C.   Inoculate one colony of each strain with a disposable sterile inoculating loop into 10 ml LB in a sterile conical flask around a Bunsen burner and incubate them at 37 °C for 6 h. Perform this step in triplicate for each strain.    From the 6 h culture, take 100 µl and add it to 900 µl LB and determine the OD600 nm.   Determine the volume of the 6 h culture required to give a starting OD600 nm of 0.05 in a 25 ml LB as follows: C1V1 = C2V2 C1 = OD600 nm of the 6 h culture; V1 = volume of the 6 h culture C2 = final OD600 nm required; V2 = final volume required V1 = 0.05 x 25 ml/C1   Make the cultures with starting OD600 nm of 0.05 in 25 ml LB for each strain and their respective replicates in sterile 250 ml conical flasks and incubate the flasks overnight on a shaker at 37 °C.   On the following day, dilute the overnight cultures 1:10 in LB and determine the OD600 nm.   Pipette 1 ml of each overnight culture into two separate sterile 1.5 ml tubes for each strain and their respective replicates.   Centrifuge the cultures at 9,000 x g for 10 min at room temperature (23-25 °C) and remove the supernatants with sterile pipette.   Wash the cell pellets by re-suspending them in sterile PBS (see Recipes) and centrifuge at 9,000 x g for 10 min. Repeat the washing step two more times.",
    "Resuspend the washed cell pellets in 1 ml of sterile PBS by pipetting up and down and vortexing and dilute 1:2; 1:5; 1:10; 1:20; 1:100; and 1:1,000 in sterile PBS to make 1 ml in sterile microcentrifuge tubes.   Transfer each diluted cell suspension into a cuvette and determine the OD600 nm of the diluted cell suspensions of the E. coli strains and their respective replicates in a spectrophotometer three times and determine the mean value.    Make serial dilutions of each cell suspension and spot 10 µl onto LB plates in triplicate and incubate the plates at 37 °C overnight.    Count the colonies and use the numbers derived to estimate the cell count (CFU ml-1) and determine the mean cell count from the triplicate experiments.   Plot the mean cell count against the mean OD600 nm of the respective dilutions of each strain in three independent experiments to obtain calibration curves from which desired cell numbers can be obtained. The standard curve of graph of the cell count versus OD600 nm is presented in Figure 1.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170715/20170715021238_3777.jpg Figure 1. Standard curve of cell numbers versus OD600 nm of COB583 (A) and COB583ΔrpoS (B)      Development of soil survival assay   Inoculate one colony each of COB583 and COB583ΔrpoS into 25 ml LB in triplicate and incubate overnight at 37 °C.    Dilute the resulting cultures 1:10 in LB and determine the OD600 nm.   Add 1 ml of the overnight culture to two sterile Eppendorf tubes for each replicate of the two strains.    Wash the cultures as described above (steps A8 and A9).    Pool the resulting cell pellets and resuspend in 2 ml of sterile PBS in a 15 ml tube.   Make 1:10 dilution (1 ml) of the each washed cell suspension to determine the OD600 nm.",
    "Based on the OD600 nm, prepare a normalised cell suspension with OD600 nm equivalent to 2 x 108 CFU ml-1 from each replicate.   Make serial dilution of each normalised bacterial suspension and spot 10 µl of each dilution on LB agar in triplicate. Allow the spots to air-dry and incubate the plates overnight at 37 °C. Count the colonies and determine the mean cell counts.    Sieve the soil to be used with 2 mm laboratory test sieve and weigh 1 g of the sieved soil into a 15 ml tube.   Take 50 µl of each normalised bacterial suspension for each strain and inoculate it into the soil (to give ~1 x 107 CFU g-1 of soil). The uninoculated control should have 50 µl of sterile PBS added to it. The experiment was set up in triplicate for each strain.   Cover the tubes with the lid and invert them 10 times by hand for proper mixing.   Leave the tubes for about 10 min at room temperature (23-25 °C).   Perform the recovery of the inoculated E. coli strains by adding 2 ml of sterile PBS to each 15 ml tube. Cover the tube with its lid, invert it three times and immediately vortex for 20 sec twice.   Leave the tube on the workbench and allow the larger soil particles in the resulting soil slurry to settle out (2-10 min, depending on soil texture) (Figure 2).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170715/20170715021443_9031.jpg Figure 2. Experimental set-up for the soil survival assay with the soil slurry just after mixing and after settling out    Take 20 µl from the supernatant of each soil slurry, place them in separate wells in a 96-well plate and make serial dilution (up to 10-6) from them.",
    "Take 10 µl of each dilution and spot onto MacConkey agar plates (see Recipes) in triplicate, and incubate plates overnight at 37 °C.    Count the colonies and use the numbers derived to estimate the mean recovered cell count (CFU ml-1) from the triplicate experiments. The percentage recovery of cells was determined."
