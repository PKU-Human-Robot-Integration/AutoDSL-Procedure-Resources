    "The protocols presented here meet the requirements of the Social and Societal Ethics committee of the KU Leuven (registration number: S-56505), and the Ethics Review Committee Psychology and Neuroscience of Maastricht University (registration numbers: 185_09_11_2017_S1 and 185_09_11_2017_S2_A1).\n1. Preparing the laboratory for a test session\nBefore the test session: Send the participant an e-mail informing him/her about the delivery of pain stimuli, of the general outline of the experiment, and the exclusion criteria. Exclusion criteria for healthy participants comprise: being under 18 years of age; chronic pain; analphabetism or diagnosed dyslexia; pregnancy; left-handedness; current/history of cardiovascular disease, chronic or acute respiratory disease (e.g., asthma, bronchitis), neurological disease (e.g., epilepsy), and/or psychiatric disorder (e.g., clinical depression, panic/anxiety disorder); uncorrected problems with hearing or vision; having pain in the dominant hand, wrist, elbow or shoulder that may hinder performing the reaching task; presence of implanted electronic medical devices (e.g., cardiac pacemaker); and presence of any other severe medical conditions.\nDue to COVID-19 safety precautions, ask the participant to wash/disinfect his/her hands upon arrival at the lab, and do so yourself. Wear a disposable facemask throughout the duration of the test session, and latex gloves whenever physical contact with the participant is required.\nUse two separate rooms or sections for the experimental setting: one for the participant and the other for the experimenter.\nUse one computer with two separate screens: one computer screen for the experimenter, and one larger television screen for the participant.\nTo turn on the robotic arm (e.g., HapticMaster), press the power switch in the front of the robot (specific to this robot). Subsequently, turn on the emergency switch, which may later be used to turn off the robot if necessary.",
    "Recalibrate the robotic arm before each test day. This is done via a direct application programming interface (API) connection with the robotic arm, and only needs to be done once, at the beginning of the test day.\n\t\nTo establish the API connection, open an internet browser on the computer, and type in the specific API address of the robotic arm.\nOn the webpage, select State under HapticMASTER. Subsequently, press the Start button next to Init (for initialize).\n\t\tNOTE: This is the standard calibration procedure for this robot. Different robots may require different calibration procedures.\nUse a constant current stimulator, which is connected to the computer (see step 1.4). During the experiment, the pain stimulus is delivered via the experimental script, which runs on the computer. The experiment is programmed using a cross-platform game engine (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nFor safety reasons, disable the constant current stimulator output by switching down the orange toggle switch in the upper-right corner of the stimulator’s front control panel.\nUse the orange toggle switch in the middle of the front control panel to set the output range to x 10 mA.\nUse the black rotary knob in the upper-left corner of the front control panel to set the pulse duration to 2 ms (2000 µs).\nTo switch on the constant current stimulator, press the power button in the lower-left corner of the front control panel.\n2. Screening for exclusion criteria and obtaining informed consent\nPosition the participant approximately 2.5 m from the television screen (see step 1.4), at a comfortable distance (~15 cm) from the handle (sensor) of the robotic arm, in a chair with arm rests (Figure 1).\nScreen the participant for exclusion criteria by means of self-report (see step 1.1 for exclusion criteria).",
    "Inform the participant about the delivery of pain stimuli and of the general outline of the experiment. Also, inform him/her that he/she is free to withdraw participation at any point during the experiment, without any repercussions. Obtain written informed consent.\nTo minimize physical contact with the participant, ensure that the participant section of the lab includes a table on which exclusion and informed consent forms, as well as a Tablet for questionnaires (see step 6.2) are placed before the participant’s arrival. The participant should be able to access and sign the forms independently using this table.\n3. Attaching the stimulation electrodes\nNOTE: The pain stimulus is a 2 ms square-wave electrical stimulus delivered cutaneously through two stainless steel bar stimulation electrodes (electrode diameter 8 mm, interelectrode distance 30 mm).\nIf the participant is wearing long sleeves, ask him/her to roll up the sleeve on his/her right arm at least 10 cm above his/her elbow.\nFill the center of the stimulation electrodes with conductive electrolyte gel and plug the electrode cables to the emergency switch, which is connected to the constant current stimulator in the experimenter section of the lab.\nAttach the stimulation electrodes over the triceps tendon of the participant’s right arm using a strap. Make sure the strap is neither too tight nor too loose. Once the electrodes have been attached, tell the participant to relax his/her arm.\n4. Calibrating the pain stimulus\nExplain the pain calibration procedure and corresponding scale by presenting it on the television screen (see step 1.4).\n\t\nClarify to the participant that he/she may choose the stimulus which he/she will receive during the experiment, but explain that for data integrity he/she is asked to select a stimulus that he/she would describe as “significantly painful and demanding some effort to tolerate”.",
    "Ask the participant to rate each stimulus on the numerical scale presented on the television screen, ranging from 0–10, where 0 is labeled as “I feel nothing”; 1 as “I feel something, but this is not unpleasant; it is only a sensation” (i.e., detection threshold), 2 as “the stimulus is not yet painful, but is beginning to be unpleasant”; 3 as “the stimulus starts being painful” (i.e. pain threshold); and 10 as “this is the worst pain I can imagine”.\nEnable the constant current stimulator output by switching up the orange toggle switch (see step 1.7.1).\nDuring the pain calibration procedure, manually increase the intensity of the pain stimuli using the rotary knob on the front control panel of the constant current stimulator. The intensity of the pain stimulus can be seen above this knob.\n\t\nStart with an intensity of 1 mA, and gradually increase the intensity in a stepwise manner, with increases of 1, 2, 3, and 4 mA increments. Use the following order of stimulus presentations in mA: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, etc.\nTo deliver the pain stimuli one stimulus at a time, manually trigger the constant current stimulator by pressing the orange trigger button on the front control panel.\n\t\nAnnounce each stimulus to the participant before triggering the constant current stimulator.\nTerminate the calibration procedure once the participant reaches a pain intensity level which he/she would describe as “significantly painful and demanding some effort to tolerate”. Ideally, this should correspond to a 7–8 on the pain calibration rating scale.\nDocument the participant’s final pain intensity in mA and his/her pain intensity rating (0–10) and maintain this intensity for the remainder of the experiment.\n5. Running the experimental task",
    "Verbally inform the participant that he/she will receive instructions about the robotic arm-reaching paradigm on the television screen in front of him/her, after which he/she will be able to practice the task under the supervision of the experimenter.\nProvide the participant with standardized written instructions of the task on-screen.\nPractice: Via the experimental script, on the television screen, present three arches (T1–T3) situated midway through the movement plane. The easiest arm movement (T1) is paired with no deviation or resistance, the middle arm movement (T2) is paired with moderate deviation and resistance, and the furthest arm movement (T3) is paired with the largest deviation and strongest resistance.\n\t\nInstruct the participant to use his/her dominant hand to operate the sensor of the robotic arm, represented by a green ball on the television screen, and to move the ball/sensor from a starting point at the lower-left corner of the movement plane, to a target at the upper-left corner of the movement plane.\nInstruct the participant that he/she can freely choose which one of the available movement trajectories to perform on each trial.\nDo not administer the pain stimulus (see section 3: Note and step 5.7.6) during the practice phase. However, ensure that the relationship between deviation and resistance (see step 5.3) is in place.\nProvide the participant with verbal feedback while they perform the practice phase.\n\t\nEnsure the participant does not start moving before the visual and auditory “start signals”, and that he/she releases the robotic arm immediately when the visual and auditory “stop signals” are presented.",
    "NOTE: Two distinct auditory signals (a “start tone” and a “scoring tone”) and two distinct visual signals (the target and a virtual “traffic light” turning green and red, respectively; Figure 1) have been used as start and stop signals. Auditory and visual start signals are presented simultaneously, as are auditory and visual stop signals.\nInstruct the participant to provide self-report measures of pain-expectancy and fear of movement-related pain on a continuous rating scale, by scrolling to the left and right on the scale using two respective foot pedals on a triple foot switch. Instruct him/her to confirm his/her answer using a third foot pedal.\n\t\tNOTE: Present self-report questions on fixed, predetermined trials, for each movement trajectory separately. Ensure, via the experimental script, that the robotic arm is immobilized and remains fixed during the time the participant is responding to the questions.\nAt the end of the practice phase, respond to the participant’s questions. Leave the experimental section/room and dim the lights. The participant starts the experiment himself/herself by pressing the ‘Confirm’ foot pedal (see step 5.5.2).\nAcquisition: During avoidance acquisition, similarly to the practice phase, let the participant choose which movement trajectory (T1–T3) to perform on each trial.\n\t\nDuring avoidance acquisition, subject the participant to the experimental Response-Outcome (movement trajectory-pain) contingencies, and to the avoidance-costs, i.e., the tradeoff between pain and effort, via the experimental script.\nSpecifically, if the participant performs the easiest movement trajectory (T1), always present the pain stimulus (100% pain/no deviation or resistance).\nIf he/she performs the middle movement trajectory (T2), present the pain stimulus with a 50% chance, but ensure he/she will have to exert more effort (moderate deviation and resistance).",
    "If the participant performs the furthest, most effortful movement trajectory (T3), do not present the pain stimulus at all, but ensure that he/she will have to exert the most effort to reach the target (0% pain/largest deviation, strongest resistance).\n\t\tNOTE: If applicable to the design, a Yoked Group can be used as control. In yoked procedures, each control participant is paired with a participant in the experimental group, such that the two receive the same reinforcement schedules48. Thus, in the current paradigm, each Yoked Group participant receives pain stimuli on the same trials as his/her Experimental Group counterpart, regardless of the trajectories he/she chooses. No acquisition of avoidance behavior is expected in the Yoked Group, given the lack of manipulated Response-Outcome (movement trajectory-pain) contingencies.\nWhere applicable, save data from each Experimental Group participant on the computer (see section 1.4), and use as reference for the reinforcement schedules of each Yoked (control) Group participant.\n\t\t\nIf using a Yoked procedure (i.e., each control participant is paired with a participant in the experimental group, such that the two receive the same reinforcement schedules48), allocate participants to groups using a randomization schedule with the rule that the first participant must be in the Experimental Group. Following this, participants are assigned to either group randomly, as long as, at each point, the number of Experimental Group participants exceeds the number of Yoked Group participants.\nOn trials with a pain stimulus, present the pain stimulus once two-thirds of the movement has been performed, i.e., once the participant has moved through a trajectory arch. The constant current stimulator is automatically triggered via the experimental script.",
    "Successful trial-completion is indicated by the presentation of visual and auditory stop signals. Subsequently, ensure, via the experimental script, that the robotic arm automatically returns to its starting position where it remains fixed. After 3,000 ms, present the visual and auditory start signals, and the participant can start the next trial.\n\t\tNOTE: Trial duration differs between trials and participants, due to differences in movement speeds. The number of trials per experimental phase can also change between experiments. We recommend a minimum of 2 x 12 trials for successful acquisition of avoidance. Including the steps described above, the acquisition protocol lasts approximately 45 min.\nGeneralization: In the generalization protocol, test for generalization of avoidance after the acquisition phase (see section 5.7).\n\tNOTE: When testing for generalization of avoidance, the on-screen trajectory arches are separated during acquisition, to leave room for the generalization trajectory arches, which are positioned between the acquisition trajectory arches (see Figure 1).\n\t\nOn the television screen, present three novel movement trajectories instead of the acquisition trajectories T1–T3. Ensure that these “generalization trajectories” (G1–G3) are located adjacent to the acquisition trajectories. Specifically, G1 is situated between T1 and T2, G2 between T2 and T3, and G3 to the right of T3 (see Figure 1). Do not pair generalization trajectories with the pain stimulus.\n\t\tNOTE: Including the steps described above, with a generalization phase of 3 x 12 trials, the avoidance generalization protocol lasts approximately 1.5 h. A Yoked Group48 is required for testing generalization of avoidance (see step 5.7.5). However, different controls can be used depending on the specific research question (cf. context modulation of avoidance in a within-subjects design24).",
    "Extinction with response prevention (RPE): In the RPE protocol, after the acquisition phase (see section 5.7), provide the participants with standardized written instructions stating that in the upcoming phase they are only allowed to perform T1.\n\t\nDuring the RPE phase, via the experimental script, visually (e.g., blocking the trajectory arches with a gate) and/or haptically (e.g., block participant’s arm movement with a haptic wall) block T2 and T3, so that only T1 is available. T1 is not paired with the pain stimulus during this phase. Including the steps described above, with an RPE phase of 4 x 12 trials, this session lasts approximately 60 min.\nTest of spontaneous recovery: For testing spontaneous recovery of avoidance, administer a 2-day protocol with 24 h ± 3 h in between sessions. On day 1, administer the RPE protocol (see section 5.9).\n\t\nOn day 2, attach the stimulation electrodes (see section 3). Provide brief on-screen refresher instructions of the task. Do not include any information regarding the pain stimuli.\nPresent the three acquisition trajectories (T1–T3, cf. acquisition phase, see section 5.7), in the absence of the pain stimulus. Including the post-experimental questionnaire (see section 6.2), and a spontaneous recovery phase of 4 x 12 trials, this session lasts approximately 45 min.\n\t\tNOTE: To prevent reinstatement of fear (i.e., return of fear following unexpected encounters with the pain stimulus42; see discussion), do not recalibrate the pain stimulus on day 2.\n6. Concluding the experiment\nOnce the participant has completed the experiment, detach the stimulation electrodes.\nProvide the participant with a Tablet located on the table in the participant’s section of the lab (see section 2.4), for responding to an exit questionnaire inquiring about the intensity and unpleasantness of the pain stimulus and avoidance-costs, as well as awareness of the experimental Response-Outcome (movement trajectory-pain) contingencies.",
    "While the participant completes the psychological trait questionnaires, clean off the electrolyte gel from the stimulation electrodes.\nOnce the participant has finished completing the psychological trait questionnaires, provide him/her with a debriefing and reimbursement.\nClean the stimulation electrodes thoroughly with a disinfectant solution appropriate for cleaning medical instruments; remove all the gel inside and around the electrodes. Dry the electrodes with soft tissue paper. Clean the sensor of the robotic arm with disinfectant wipes or spray.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
