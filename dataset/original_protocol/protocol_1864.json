    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of small intestine tissues\nTiming: 30 min\nThis section describes how to dissect and process the SI for removal of the epithelial monolayer containing the lymphocytes.\nDissection and tissue processing of the SI\nMice are sacrificed by carbon dioxide asphyxiation. To prevent fur contamination, the carcasses are doused with 70% ethanol. Small dorsal incisions are made in the pelvis region using scissors. The pelt is then removed from the head to the base of the tail by carefully tearing the skin in the transverse plane. See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A for an example of dorsal incision, and Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B for pelt removal.\nTurn over the mice on to its ventral side, and cut open the peritoneal membrane using scissors to expose the intestine. See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A for an example of cutting the peritoneal membrane and Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B for exposing the SI.\nCut the SI below the pyloric sphincter and above the cecum using scissors. See Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A for an example of cutting the SI below the pyloric sphincter, and Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B for cutting the SI above the cecum.\nPull out the intestine using forceps, while removing the mesenteric fat using another set of forceps. See Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A for an example of proper mesenteric fat removal during dissection, whereas Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B shows incomplete fat removal. Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C is the zoomed-in view of the mesenteric fat.\nCritical: The complete removal of the visceral and mesenteric fat is necessary to ensure optimal yield and viability of the SI IELs.",
    "Place the SI into a 10 cm petri dish pre-layered with 2% FBS-HBSS and flush out the fecal content with 2% FBS-HBSS using a 12 mL syringe with a 16G blunt needle. Use curved forceps to slide the SI onto the needle as you flush with 2% FBS-HBSS to remove the fecal matter. Transfer the SI to a new dish with 2% FBS-HBSS and repeat the flushing process. See Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] for an example of the SI before (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A) and after (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B) flushing out of fecal matters.\nCritical: If mesenteric fat remains visible on the SI after the first round of flushing, remove the SI from the petri dish and place it on a paper towel, stretching out the SI lengthwise. Be sure to cover the SI with 2% FBS-HBSS to minimize the loss of IELs. Then, starting from one end of the stretched-out SI and moving to the other, peel the SI away from the fat using two curved blunt-edged forceps– the fat will stick to the paper towel. See Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6] for an example of the post-dissection fat removal process. Once all visible fat is removed, return the SI to the petri dish for a second round of flushing.\nTransfer the flushed SI into a new petri dish pre-layered with 2% FBS-HBSS and cut open the SI longitudinally using scissors. See Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7] for a visual representation of the cutting process. Shake the SI using forceps to remove mucus and any remaining fecal content. Transfer the SI to a new dish with 2% FBS-HBSS and repeat the shaking process.",
    "Critical: Incomplete removal of the mucus leads to decreased IEL viability and yield. Perform visual inspection of the processed SI and confirm that fecal matter and the mucus are completely removed. Ensure to shake the SI gently to avoid stripping off the epithelial layer.\nTransfer the cut-open SI into a new petri dish with 2% FBS-HBSS and slice into ∼1 cm piece. See Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A for an example of ∼1 cm cut SI pieces.\nCritical: If the cut SI pieces are longer than 1 cm, IEL recovery can decrease because the subsequent removal of epithelial monolayer will be inefficient.\nTransfer the SI pieces into a 50 mL tube and fill up to 25 mL with 2% FBS-HBSS and shake. Pour out the content into a new petri dish. Using forceps, transfer the cut SI pieces into the same 50 mL tube and fill up to 25 mL with 2% FBS-HBSS and shake again.\nNote: The washed and processed SI pieces can be kept at this stage on ice when processing more than one SI.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1457-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Using forceps, transfer the cut SI pieces from the petri dish into the 125 mL conical flask containing solution A.\nShake the conical flask at 240 rpm at 37°C for 45 min in a pre-warmed 37°C orbital shaker. See Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8] for an example of SI pieces before and after shaking.\nNote: After shaking, the solution should be cloudy which indicates effective removal of the SI epithelial layer.",
    "Critical: Solution A should always be prepared fresh. Solution A and the orbital shaker should be pre-warmed to 37°C for efficient removal of the SI epithelial monolayer.\nTransfer the SI eluate, which will be around 25 mL, into a 50 mL tube by passing it through 70 μm cell strainers.\nCentrifuge at 1,500 rpm (500 × g) for 7 min at 10°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 10 mL cold PBS.\nNote: Take an 1 mL aliquot of the cell suspension and set it aside and keep it at 4°C to compare the purity before and after the EpCAM+ cell depletion (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nFill up the 50 mL tube with the SI eluate to 25 mL with cold PBS and centrifuge tube at 1,500 rpm (500 × g) for 7 min at 10°C.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nCritical: Cell suspension should be kept on ice to ensure maximum cell viability.\nCounting of cell numbers\nAdd 10 μL of the single cell suspension from step 2f to 190 μL 0.08% trypan blue (1:20 dilution).\nTake 10 μL of the cell suspension from step 3a and count the cells using a hematocytometer. (Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1])\nNote: We routinely use trypan blue and a hematocytometer to count the number of viable cells. Expect a high rate of cell death (>30%), which will be caused by the mechanical stress during the isolation procedure.\nDepletion of EpCAM+ SI epithelial cells\nTiming: 2 h\nThis section describes in detail how to deplete SI epithelial cells from the eluate using anti-EpCAM antibodies.\nIncubation with anti-EpCAM antibodies\nAfter determining the cell numbers, resuspend the cells in 10% FBS-HBSS at a concentration of 20 million cells/mL. Empirically, 50–100 million cells are recovered from one SI isolation.",
    "Add 15 μL/mL of 0.5 mg/mL anti-EpCAM antibody to the resuspended cells and incubate the cell suspension undisturbed on ice for 30 min. (Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3])\nNote: During the 30 min incubation, prepare the goat anti-rat IgG-coated and goat anti-mouse IgG-coated BioMag magnetic beads (step 5).\nAfter 30 min of incubation, fill up the tubes up to 25 mL with 10% FBS-HBSS and centrifuge tubes at 1,500 rpm (500 × g) for 7 min at 10°C to remove excess antibodies.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pelleted cells in 10% FBS-HBSS to an estimated concentration of 50 million/mL, based on the cell numbers from step 3b.\nWashing and preparing BioMag beads\nTake each 2 mL of goat anti-rat IgG-coated and goat anti-mouse IgG-coated BioMag magnetic beads for 100 million cells and transfer them into a 14 mL polypropylene round-bottom tube and place the tube on a magnetic stand for 5 min. During the incubation time, the magnetic beads will slowly but firmly adhere to the magnet. (Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5])\nNote: Even if the cell numbers are below 100 million, 2 mL of goat anti-rat IgG BioMag beads and goat anti-mouse IgG BioMag should be used. The goat anti-mouse IgG beads are used to deplete B cells from the cell suspension and can be omitted.\nWhile keeping the tubes attached to the magnet so that the beads remain magnetized, remove the supernatant by aspiration. Resuspend the BioMag beads in 10 mL of 10% FBS-HBSS and place the cell suspension on the magnet for an additional 5 min. Repeat this process one more time.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the beads in 1 mL of 10% FBS-HBSS. To this suspension, add the cells from step 4d and transfer the suspension into a 5 mL polypropylene tube.",
    "Place the tube on the MACSmix™ tube rotator for 40 min at 4°C. See Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9] for an example of before (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]A) and after (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]B) rotation of the beads with cells.\nAfter 40 min of rotation, place the tube on a magnet for 5 min and transfer the supernatant into a new 5 mL polypropylene tube. Place the tube on the magnet for another 5 min to remove residual magnetic beads from the cell suspension. See Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10] for the depiction of proper removal of magnetic beads. (Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9])\nNote: The tube can be placed back on the magnet as many times as necessary to ensure complete removal of magnetic beads.\nTransfer the supernatant into a new 14 mL tube and keep on ice until further use.\nNote: Measure the volume of the supernatant to determine recovered cell numbers.\nCounting of cell numbers\nAdd 10 μL of the single cell suspension from step 5f to 190 μL 0.08% trypan blue (1:20 dilution).\nTake 10 μL of the cell suspension from step 6a and count the cells using a hematocytometer.

    "This section describes how to stain cells for purity check.\nSurface marker staining\nTake 5 million IELs and transfer them into 5 mL polystyrene round-bottom tubes. Add 2 mL of cold FACS buffer to each tube and centrifuge the tubes at 1,500 rpm (500×g) for 7 min at 10°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and stain with antibodies to surface markers in FACS buffer, according to the dilution factors as indicated below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1457_8.csv\nUse 10 μL each of the diluted antibodies to make a master mix for antibodies, according to the number of samples. Make extra amounts of the master mix (calculate for 2 or 3 more samples than necessary) to secure enough reagents and to compensate for pipetting errors.\nNote: We recommend making a master mix, which includes all the corresponding fluorescence-conjugated antibodies and the anti-mouse CD16/32 blocking antibody, when staining with multiple antibodies to reduce variability between samples by pipetting.\nAdd 70 μL of the antibody master mix to each tube. For the single-color compensation tubes, add 10 μL of the diluted antibody according to the staining chart. Add 5 μL anti-mouse CD16/32 (Clone: 2.4G2) to all tubes.\nIncubate tubes at 4°C for 30 min.\nAdd 2 mL of cold FACS buffer to each tube, and then spin down cells at 1,500 rpm (500 × g) for 7 min at 10°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and repeat step 7f to wash the cells again.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend pellet with 200 μL cold FACS buffer.\nFilter the cells into new FACS tubes by passing through 60 μm nylon filters and place the tubes on ice until flow cytometric analysis.",
    "Note: Filter the cell suspension through 60 μm nylon filters to remove cellular aggregates. To prevent reaggregation, cells should be not filtered earlier than 30 min before the start of data acquisition.\nSample collection and data analysis\nTiming: 2 h\nThis section describes how to collect samples using a flow cytometer and which software to use for data analysis.\nUse unstained cells and single-color control staining to set appropriate photomultiplier tube (PMT) voltages and compensations for each parameter.\nAt least 0.5 million PI-negative live-gated cells should be collected per tube at a flow rate of 6,000 events/second or less. A representative voltage setting for acquisition would be as follows: FCS: 565, SSC: 330, FITC: 500, PE-Cy7: 630, eFluor 450: 390, Alexa Fluor 647: 460, Alexa Fluor 594: 510, APC-e780: 580, BV786: 580, PI: 375.\nNote: The voltage of each parameter needs to be adjusted using unstained compensation tubes and single color-stained compensation tubes for each experiment (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nThe .FCS format flow cytometry files were analyzed using the software FlowJo with linear scales for Forward Scatter Height (FSC-H) and Forward Scatter Width (FCS-W), and log scales for fluorochrome parameters. Statistical analyses were performed using the software GraphPad Prism 7, and the figures for publication were created with the graphical software Canvas X."
