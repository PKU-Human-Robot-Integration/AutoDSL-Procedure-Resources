    "Ethics statement: All experimental protocols were approved by the Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) under the protocol #A095-14-04. Note: See Table 1 in \"Materials and Equipment\" section for details of software used.\n1. Stimulating and Recording Mouse USVs\nPreparation of the males before the recording sessions\n\tNOTE: The representative results were obtained using B6D2F1/J young adult male mice (7 - 8 weeks old). This protocol can be adapted for any strain.\n\t\nSet the light cycle of the animal room on a 12-h light/dark cycle, unless otherwise required. Follow standard housing rules of 4 to 5 males per cage unless otherwise required or needed. Three days before recording, expose males individually to a sexually mature and receptive female (up to 3 males with one female per cage) of the same strain overnight.\nThe next day remove the female from the male's cage and house the males without the females for at least two days before the first recording session to increase the social motivation to sing (based on our trial and error anecdotal analyses).\nPreparation of the recording boxes\n\t\nUse a beach cooler (internal dimensions are L 27 x W 23 x H 47 cm) to act as a sound attenuation box studio (Figure 2A). Drill a small hole on top of the box to let the microphone's wire run in.",
    "NOTE: Recording the animals in a sound attenuated and visually isolated environment is preferable, in order to record dozens of mice at once without them hearing or seeing each other, prevent recording contaminating ambient room equipment noise and people in the room, and to obtain clean sound recordings of the mice (Figure 2B). We have not noted sound echos or distortions to the sound when comparing vocalizations of the same mouse inside versus outside of the sound attenuation chamber (Figure 2C); rather, there the sounds may be louder and have fewer harmonics inside the chamber.\nConnect the microphone to the wire, the wire to the sound card, and the sound card to the computer to work with a sound recording software (e.g. Software A in Figure 1 and Table 1). An adequate sound recording software is necessary, such as software A that generates .wav sound files.\nPlace an empty cage (58 x 33 x 40 cm) inside the soundproof box, and adjust the microphone's height so that the membrane of the microphone is 35 - 40 cm above the bottom of the cage, and that the microphone is centered above the cage (see Figure 2A).\nConfiguration of recording software A (Table 1) for continuous recording\n\t\nDouble click and open software A. Click and open the \"configuration\" menu and select the Device named, sampling rate (250,000 Hz), Format (16 bit).\nSelect the key \"Trigger\" option and check \"Toggle\".\n\t\tNOTE: This setting allows starting of the recording by pressing a key (F1, F2, etc.) while placing the stimulus in the mouse's cage.\nEnter the mouse's ID under the \"Name\" parameter.\nSet the maximum file size to the desired minutes of recording (we usually set to 5 min).",
    "NOTE: The longer the minutes the greater amount of computer storage memory needed. If continuous mode is not set, the software cuts off song bouts in the beginning or end of a sequence based on set parameters, and therefore one cannot reliably quantify sequences.\nRecord USVs using the different stimuli. Note: Each stimulus can be used independently depending on the user's experimental needs.\n\t\nGently lift the animal to be recorded by the tail, and place it in a cage without bedding (to prevent movement noise on the bedding) inside the soundproof box, and put the cage open-wired metal lid on top of it, with the lid facing up.\nClose the sound attenuated box and let the animal habituate to it for 15 min. Carry out the stimuli preparation (1.4) at this moment.\nStimuli preparation\n\t\nPreparation of fresh urine (UR) samples as a stimulus\n\t\t\nObtain urine samples at a maximum of 5 minutes before the recording session to ensure maximum effect in inducing song from the males. NOTE: Urine that has been sitting around longer, and especially for hours or overnight, is not as effective24,25, which we have empirically verified23.\nPick a female or male (depending on the sex of the stimulus to be used) in one cage, grab the skin behind the neck and restrain the animal in one hand as for a drug injection procedure with the belly exposed.\nWith a pair of tweezers, grab a cotton tip (3 - 4 mm long x 2 mm wide). Gently rub and push on the animal's bladder to extract one drop of fresh urine. Wipe the female's vagina or the male's penis to collect the entire drop on the cotton tip.",
    "Then, select another cage. And repeat the same procedure with another female or male but with the same cotton tip previously used.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This procedure makes sure to mix the urine of at least two females or males from two independent cages on the same cotton tip to ensure against any estrus or other individual effects as it's known that estrus cycle could influence the singing behavior18,26.\nPlace the cotton tip to be used in a clean glass or plastic petri dish.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Since the cotton tip with urine will need to be used within the next 5 min, there is no need to cover it to prevent evaporation.\nPreparation of the live female (FE) stimulus as a stimulus\n\t\t\nSelect one or two new cages of sexually mature females. Identify females in the pro-estrus or estrus stage by visual inspection (wide vagina opening and pink surround as shown in27,28). Separate them in a different cage until use.\nPreparation of the anesthetized animals females (AF) or males (AM) as a stimulus\n\t\t\nFor the AF, select a female from the pool above (either in pro-estrus or estrus).For the AM, select a male from a cage of adult male mice.\nAnesthetize the female or male with an intraperitoneal injection of a solution of Ketamine/Xylazine (100 and 10 mg/kg respectively).\nUse eye ointment to prevent dehydration of the eyes while the animal is anesthetized. Check proper anesthesia by testing the paw retraction reflex when pinched. Place the anesthetized animal in a clean cage on a paper towel, with the cage on the heat pad set on \"minimum heat\" to ensure control of body temperature.",
    "Re-use the same animals up to 2 to 3 times for different recording sessions if needed before they wake up (usually around 45 min). Put them back on the heat pad after each recording session.\nControl the respiratory rate by visual inspection (~ 60 - 80 breaths per min) and body temperature by touching the animal every 5 min (should be warm to touch).\nWhen ready to record, click on the \"Record\" button of software A.\n\t\tNOTE: The recordings won't start unless the user clicks the key button associated with each channel; monitor the live audio feed from the cages on the computer screen to make sure the animals sing and the recordings are properly being obtained.\nSimultaneously hit the associated key button of the desired box(es) to be recorded (i.e. F1 for box 1), and introduce the desired stimulus.\n\t\t\nPresent one of the stimuli as follows. Place the cotton tip with fresh urine samples inside the cage, or place the live female inside the cage, or place one of the anesthetized- animals (AF or AM) on top of the cage's metal lid.\nQuietly close the recording box, and let the recording go for the preset number of minutes (e.g. 5 min as described in section 1.3).\nAfter recording, click the stop square red button to stop the recording.\nIf an anesthetized animal was used as a stimulus, open the soundproof recording box, take the anesthetized animal from the cage's metal lid and put it back on the heating pad before the next recording session, or if no longer using the animal as a stimulus check it every 15 min until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.",
    "Open the cage and remove the conscious test animal, and place it back to its home cage. Clean the test cage with 70% alcohol and distilled water.\n2. Processing .wav Files and Syllable Coding Using Mouse Song Analyzer v1.3\nOpen coding software B (Figure 1, Table 1) and put the folder containing the Software Script C of \"Mouse Song Analyzer\" (Figure 1, Table 1) in software B's path by clicking on \"set path\" and add the folder on software B. Then close software B to save.\nConfigure the combined software B+C's syllable identification settings. NOTE: The software script C code automatically creates a new folder called \"sonograms\" with files in .sng format in the same folder were the .wav files are located. It is usually better to put all the .wav files from the same recording session generated using software A in the same folder.\n\t\nOpen software B configured with C.\n\t\tNOTE: This version of software B is entirely compatible with the software script C. It cannot be guaranteed that any later versions will accept all the functions included in the current code.\nNavigate to the folder of interest containing the recording .wav files to be analyzed using the \"current folder\" window.\nIn the \"command window\", enter the \"whis_gui\" command.\nIn the new whis-gui window, observe several sub-window sections with different parameters (Figure 3), including \"Sonogram Parameters\", \"Whistle Options\", and all others. Adjust the parameters for detecting USVs. Use the following parameter settings for detecting USVs syllables from laboratory mice (e.g. B6D2F1/J and C57BL/6J mouse strains used in our studies):\nIn the Sonogram Parameters section, adjust the Min Frequency to 15,000 Hz, the Max Frequency to 125,000 Hz, the sampling frequency (Number of frequency) to 256 kHz, and the Threshold to 0.3.",
    "In the Whistle Options section, adjust the Purity Threshold to 0.075, the Min Duration of the syllable to 3 ms, the Min Frequency sweep to 20,000 Hz, and the Filter Duration to 3 ms.\nIn the other sections, adjust the Min Note Duration to 3 ms, and the Min Note Count to 1.\nFor syllable categorization protocol, select boxes in the middle section of the whis_gui window:\n\t\tThe default categorization is based on Holy and Guo11 and Arriaga et al.10, which codes syllable by the number of pitch jumps and the direction of the jump: S for simple continuous syllable; D for one down pitch jump; U for one up pitch jump; DD for two sequential down jumps; DU for one down and one up jump; etc. This will be default if the user does not select anything. The user has the option to run the analysis on certain syllable types by selecting each of the representative boxes.\n\t\tTo choose to syllable categorization as described by Scattoni, et al.9, additionally select Split s category, which separates this type into more sub-categories based on syllable shape.\n\t\tSelect Harmonics if the user wants to further sort syllables into those with and without harmonics.\nClassify the syllables in the .wav files of interest\n\t\nSelect all the .wav files from one recording session in the upper left section of the whis_gui window.\nClick \"Get sonograms\" in the middle of the whis_gui window (Figure 3). A new folder containing the sonograms will be created, with .sng file format.Select all the sonograms (.sng files) in upper left corner of whis-gui window.Enter \"Animal ID\" and \"Session ID\" in the boxes below the sonogram file window. Then click process sonograms.",
    "Observe three file types in the sonogram folder: \"Animal ID-Session ID -Notes.csv\" (contains information on the notes extracted from the syllables), \"Animal ID-Session ID -Syllables.csv\", (contains values of all the classified syllables, including their spectral features and the total number of syllables detected in the sonograms), \"Animal ID-Session ID -Traces.mat\", (contains graphical representations of all the syllables).\n\t\t\tNOTE: The \"Animal ID-Session ID -Syllables\" file sometimes contain a small percent (2 - 16%) of unclassified USV syllables that are more complex than those selected, or that have two animal's syllables overlapping each other23. These can be examined separately from the trace file if necessary.\n3. Quantification of Syllable Acoustic Structure and Syntax\nNOTE: Instructions for the steps to take for initial syntax analyses are included in the \"READ ME!\" spreadsheet of the \"Song Analysis Guide v1.1.xlsx\" file, our custom designed spreadsheet calculator E (Figure 1, Table 1).\nOpen the software script C file output \"Animal ID-Session ID -Syllables.csv\" obtained in the section above with spreadsheet software D (Figure 1, Table 1). It contains the total number of syllables detected in all the sonograms, and all their spectral features.\nIf not converted yet, within the spreadsheet software D convert this .csv file to column separation in software D in order to put each value into individual columns.\nOpen the \"Song Analysis Guide v1.1.xlsx\" file also in software D. Then click on the template spreadsheet, and copy and paste the \"Animal ID-Session ID -Syllables.csv\" file data into this sheet as recommended in the Template sheet instructions. Remove rows with the 'Unclassified' category of syllables.\nAfter removing the 'Unclassified' rows, first copy and recalculate ISI (inter syllable interval) data in column O into column E. Second, copy all data from column A to N into to the 'Data' spreadsheet.",
    "In the Data spreadsheet enter the animal IDs (column AF) and recording length (in minutes; column AC).\n\tNOTE: The animal IDs have to match the one entered in the recording set up. The file will detect the characters entered and compare it to the name of the .wav files.\nDetermine the ISI cutoff to define a sequence by using the spreadsheet labeled \"Density ISI\", the 'ISI plot' result.\n\tNOTE: In our past study23, we set the cutoff at two standard deviations from the center of the last peak. It consisted of long intervals (LI) of more than 250 ms, which separated different song bouts within a session of singing.\nView the main results in the 'Features' spreadsheet (grouping all the spectral features measured from each animal).\n\tNOTE: If the user used the default syllable category setting in software script C described in section 2.8.9, the syllables are then further classified into 4 categories as described above and in Chabout, et al. 23: 1) simple syllable without any pitch jumps, « s » ; 2) two note syllables separated by a single upward (« u ») jump; 3) two note syllables separated by a single downward jump (« d »); and 4) more complex syllables with two or more pitch jumps between notes (« m »).\nFor syntax values, click on the \"Global Probabilities\" spreadsheet which calculates probabilities of each pair of syllable transition types regardless of starting syllables, using the following equation 23.\n\tP (Occurrence of a transition type) = Total number of occurrences of a transition type / Total number of transitions of all types\nClick on the 'Conditional probabilities' spreadsheet to calculate the conditional probabilities for each transition type relative to starting syllables, which uses the following equation:",
    "P (occurrence of a transition type given the starting syllable) = Total number of occurrences of a transition type / Total number of occurrences of all transition types with the same starting syllable\nTo test whether and which of the above transition probabilities differ from non-random, using a first order Markov model, following the approach in23, to use custom software F (e.g. Syntax decorder in R studio; Figure 1, Table 1) with the following R scripts: Tests_For_Differences_In_Dynamics_Between_Contexts.R for within groups in different conditions; or Tests_For_Differences_In_Dynamics_Between_Genotypes.R for between groups in the same conditions.\nPerform a Chi-square test, or other test of your preference, to test for statistical differences in the transition probabilities of the same animal across different context (pair-wise), following the approach in23.\n\tNOTE: More details about the statistical model used to compare syntax among groups are found in23. Researchers can use other approaches to analyze the global or conditional transition probabilities that they or others developed.\nTo graphically display the sequences as syntax diagrams enter the values into a network graphing software G (see Figure 1, Table 1), with nodes designating different syllable categories, and arrow color and/or thickness pixel representing ranges of probability values between syllables.\n\tNOTE: For clarity, for the global probability graphs, we only show transitions higher than 0.005 (higher than 0.5% of chance occurrence). For the conditional probabilities, we use a threshold of 0.05 because each probability in the \"global model\" is lower considering that we divide by the total number of syllables and not only by one specific syllable type.\n4. Song Editing and Testing Preference for a Type of Song",
    "NOTE: Playbacks of USVs can be used to experimentally test an animal's behavioral response, including preference for a specific song type. Because female preferences might change depending on the estrus state, for females make sure they are in the same estrus state before testing as follows:\nPrepare females with sexual experience several days before the playback experiment\n\t\nExpose sexually mature females (> 7 weeks) to a male for 3 days before the experiments to trigger estrus (Whitten 28 effect), by placing them in a separation cage (clear solid plastic with drilled holes in it) allowing the female to see and smell the male but preventing sexual intercourse.\nMonitor the estrus cycle, and when pro-estrus or estrus is evident (vaginal opening and pink surround as shown in27), put females back together in their own cage. They are ready to be tested the next day.\nPrepare the song files for playback\n\t\nUse the copy and paste functions in a sound processing software H (e.g. SASLap Pro; Figure 1, Table 1) to create two edited .wav files with the desired conditions to be used for stimuli. To guard against amount of vocalizations as a variable, make sure the two sound files contain the same number of syllables and length of sequences (song bouts) from the same or different males/females from the desired contexts (e.g. UR).\nOpen the first file containing song from condition 1 in software H. Then go to File > Specials > Add channel(s) from file, and select the second sound file to test from condition 2. This creates 2 channels, one for each condition.\nAdjust the volume visually if needed to make sure the volumes of the two files match each other, by going to Edit > Volume.",
    "Then go to Edit > Format > Sampling Frequency Conversion, and select convert from 250,000 Hz to 1,000,000 Hz to transform the .wav files from a sampling frequency of 256 kHz to 1 MHz. This step is necessary for the playback device to read the .wav files.\nSave these new files as the test files to be played back. Make sure to identify which song is in which channel (1 or 2). For clarity purposes name it \"file name.wav\".\nGo to Exit > Format > Swap Channels and swap the two channels. Save the swapped versions using a different name. NOTE: This will be the opposite copy with the channels inverted, named later 'file name_swapped.wav'.\nPrepare the playback apparatus\n\t\nClean the playback apparatus \"Y-maze\" with 70% alcohol followed by distilled water. Dry it with paper towels. Our Y-maze is a homemade opaque solid black plastic apparatus, with arms of 30 cm long, and two drilled holes on the extreme ends of the maze to allow the ultrasound speaker to fit at floor level of the arms (Figure 4A).\nMake sure the speakers are in their proper positions and connected to the sound card, and the card is connected to the computer.\nOpen software A, select Play > Device and select the playback sound card device. Select \"use file header rate\". Go to Play > Playlist and load the file of interest containing the two channels (i.e. \"file.wav\"). Select \"loop mode\". Set up the video recorder above the maze to cover the entire maze.\nPerform the playback experiment\n\t\nPlace the test female in the maze for a 10-minute habituation period. After 10 minutes, if the female is not in the starting arm then gently push the female back to the starting arm, and close the plastic separation window.",
    "Select the prepared file (\"file.wav\") to playback and play it. Start the video recording, and make sure to identify which channel is positioned on which Y-maze's arm (i.e.: UR in the left, or FE in the right arm) with a paper note in the video recording field of view.\nAllow the female to hear the songs in loop mode and explore the maze during a desired number of minutes (i.e. 5 min): this is one session. Return the female back into the starting arm. Allow her to rest for 1 min while preparing the next session. Remove any urine traces and excrement with distilled water.\nLoad the \"file_swapped.wav\" file\". Switch the location of the paper notes for the video recording. Move the left one to the right side and vice-versa. After 1 min, play the file. Free the female for the second session.\nRepeat steps 4.4.3 to 4.4.4 for a total of 4 sessions x 5 minutes to control for detecting potential side bias during the test. Stop the video recording at the end of all sessions by clicking the red stop button. Clean the maze with 70% alcohol and distilled water between females.\nRepeat all the steps with different song exemplars a week later with the same females to obtain sufficient results to test reliability of the findings.\nLater observe the videos, and use the timer on the video and a stopwatch to measure the time spent by the females in each arm for each session. Analyze the resultant data statistically for possible song preferences."
