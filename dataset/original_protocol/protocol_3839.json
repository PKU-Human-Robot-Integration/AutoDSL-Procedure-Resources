    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDissection of formalin-fixed tissue\nTiming: 5–30 min\nLeftover formalin fixed tissue from the surgical resection of a solid tumor is dissected into three portions – tumor, tumor-adjacent, and distant normal tissue.\nThis describes the major steps of tissue dissection (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] and Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1], Residual tissue dissection). Please see above for tissue-specific information.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/755-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Dissection workflow for left-over surgical tissue\n(A) Lay out collection containers and retrieve surgical specimen from formalin.\n(B) Examine the tissue to plan separation into required components.\n(C) Using a scalpel, separate tumor, tumor-adjacent, and distant normal components.\n(D) Place each component in a separate pile.\n(E) Place each tissue pile into a separate labeled container and record the tissue weight.\n(F) Submerge tissues in PBS to further remove formalin prior to homogenization.\nFor a single patient sample, place the specimen bucket and empty containers for collection of tumor, tumor-adjacent, and distant normal tissue on the dissection board.\nCollect all material from the specimen bucket and place on the dissection board, blotting any excess formaldehyde. Use a sieve to collect any dispersed remnant tissue.\nWork systematically to identify tumor, tumor-adjacent, and distant normal tissues. Using the scalpel, separate these areas based on the macroscopic assessment of the peripheral tumor bordering the surrounding tissue.\nNote: See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nArrange the tissue into 3 piles on the dissection board. Each pile should be comprised as follows:\nTumor: Sample the tumor in its entirety to include all necrotic, mucinous, hemorrhagic, and cystic areas. Amount of tissue will vary from 1 g up to 20 kg, depending on the tumor type.",
    "Tumor-adjacent: The tumor-adjacent tissue should comprise of predominantly normal tissue immediately adjacent to the macroscopic tumor perimeter, usually 5–10 mm in width for most specimens (depending upon tumor size and thickness of surgical resection margins). Depending on the surgical procedure performed, the tumor may lie asymmetrically within the specimen. If the tumor lies very close to one or more of the surgical margins, it is acceptable to take what tissue is available (i.e., some tumor- adjacent tissue may be very thin, capsular or absent at the surgical resection margins. Amount of tumor-adjacent tissue will vary, but may often be in the range of 5–10 g.\nDistant normal: Distant normal should ideally be a piece of normal tissue from the same organ from which the tumor has originated (e.g., Normal kidney from furthest pole in cases of renal carcinoma). If this is not possible, then a piece of macroscopically normal tissue from an adjacent organ contained within the specimen is taken (e.g., Adrenal Gland in cases of renal carcinoma), and the tissue of origin noted on the dissection paperwork. If possible, avoid skin, colonic mucosa and lipomatous tissues as distant normal (See detailed guidance notes in Preparation for Dissection of Fixed Tissue). Collect 5–10 g of tissue minimum, if possible; however, it is of higher importance to ensure that the distant normal does not contain contaminating tumor tissue.\nOnce separated, record the weight of each sample and place in the empty buckets labeled appropriately as tumor, tumor-adjacent, or distant normal tissue.\nAdd 1× PBS to each of the sample buckets.",
    "Completely submerge the tissue in PBS. Currently, there is no recommended size of tissue pieces for submersion in PBS; it is sufficient to simply collect the tissues that have previously been segmented prior to formalin fixation and further dissected as described above.\nEnsure the lid is fitted correctly and remove from the dissection area.\nSoak tissue in PBS for at least 24 h to dissipate the formalin.\nFinalize any documentation prior to moving to the next case.\nPause Point: The dissected, formalin-fixed samples can be stored for 24–48 h at 20°C–22°C in PBS prior to homogenization.\nNote: Take utmost care to ensure correct labeling of sample buckets.\nNote: It may be helpful to draw a rough sketch demonstrating the macroscopic relationship between the tumor, tumor-adjacent, and distant normal tissues, and keep this with the documentation for each specific case (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nNote: Some tumors will have a well-circumscribed border or encapsulation making it easier to separate tumor from tumor-adjacent tissue (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). Others with more irregular borders, such as stellate lesions, will require personal judgment. The fundamental principle is to use expert judgement to separate the leftover surgical tissue macroscopically into the three key components described above (tumor, tumor-adjacent, and distant normal tissues). Although the goal is for each component to be as pure as possible, it is acceptable for each of these to contain small amounts of the other components. For example, small quantities of macroscopically normal tissue may be included in the tumor tissue sample in these cases. Likewise, some striations of tumor on the periphery may be included in the tumor-adjacent tissue sample if they are difficult to macroscopically identify. The most critical aspect is for distant normal tissue to avoid contamination with tumor tissue.",
    "Note: When targeting distant normal tissue, try to target stromal areas that will have a high degree of cellularity. If this is not possible, other sources of germline DNA, such as PBMCs, are acceptable.\nNote: When selecting an area of the specimen from which to sample distant normal tissue, try to focus on areas of high or dense cellularity with the exception of colonic mucosa and skin. Lipomatous areas should be avoided (if possible) as these often yield low quantities of genetic material. Colonic mucosa and skin possess high quantities of strong elastic fibers. These fibers tend to wrap themselves around the blender blades and create a physical barrier that prevents the blade from producing a homogenate. If skin or colonic mucosa is the only tissue available for distant normal sampling, first dissect the tissue into small segments approximately 1 × 1 cm to reduce the length of the fibers and their ability to wrap around the blades.\nNote: Take care to examine the dissected tissue for any material that may not be suitable for blending. These materials include, but are not limited to: suture materials, staples, heavily calcified areas of the tumor (more often encountered in tumors from gynecologic cancers, breast cancers, and sarcomas).",
    "Note: It is accepted that institutional practices in both surgery and the pathological examination of surgical tissue will vary according to local protocols and requirements. This study has primarily been focused on specimens received and examined at the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust (London, UK). Local protocols relating to surgical orientation of specimens and subsequent differential marking of resection margins makes it easier to re-construct specimens following histological sampling. Other institutions may not implement these practices, and thus reconstructing left over surgical tissue may prove more challenging. Please see the previous notes describing our experience with the dissection of specific tumor tissue types.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/755-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Examples of tumors with different borders\n(A) A recurrent invasive breast carcinoma showing irregular infiltrative edges extending deep into adipose tissue.\n(b) A well-circumscribed liposarcoma with a smooth capsule surrounding the tumor.\nHomogenization of dissected tissue\nTiming: 15–30 min\nDissected tumor, tumor-adjacent, and distant normal tissues are homogenized into three individual well-mixed representative samples (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2], Residual tissue homogenization).\nAdd 1× PBS to tissue in appropriate sized blender and close container.\nPlace blender container on blender base and secure properly on the base.\nBlend for 30 s on the highest setting of a 1000 watt output blender (on the suggested BL660 Ninja blender, use setting 3).\nNote: See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nTransfer sample to labeled 50 mL conical storage tube.",
    "Pipette using a 10–50 mL open tip pipette, or pour if too dilute to pipette.\nIf sample in excess of desired amount is generated, dispose of excess sample in appropriate waste receptacle.\nAdd 1 mL of 5% sodium azide to each 50 mL storage tube to reach a final concentration of 0.1% sodium azide.\nEach blender container is single use. Dispose of blender containers in a sealed clinical waste bin, or other appropriate waste bin, in accordance with hospital policies for formalin fixed waste tissue.",
    "Optional: Process for blending, and proportionally sub-sampling, tumors larger than 1 kg in order to preserve the relative abundance of subclonal genomic alterations. Separate the sample into sections weighing 1 kg or smaller. Process the first section at a 1:1 ratio of tissue (g) to 1× PBS using the 72 oz blender container. Take an aliquot of blended tissue equal to 1/10th of the starting weight of the tissue section. Add the aliquot of blended tissue to a second 16 oz or 72 oz mixing blender container, as appropriate. The 16 oz blender container will hold a maximum of 400 mL. Pour off the remaining blended tissue from the first blender into a waste container. To the first blender container, add the second tissue section and an equal volume of PBS. Blend and sub-sample the second tissue section as before, adding the aliquot of blended tissue to the same mixing blender container. Blend and sub-sample any additional tissue sections, each time adding a 1/10 aliquot to the same mixing blender container. Once the last tissue section has been sub-sampled, place the second mixing blender containing all of the aliquots on the blender base. Blend for 30 s to homogenize the aliquots and create a final homogenized representative sample. Transfer the final homogenized representative sample to storage tubes for downstream applications or tissue archival (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nMethods video S2. Residual tissue homogenization, related to homogenization of dissected tissue, steps 8–11\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/755-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Examples of representative samples from different tumors\nRepresentative Samples consist of dissected leftover formalin fixed tissues that have been homogenized to create a well-mixed liquid sample that is capable of being pipetted or poured. The sample color varies due to surgical dyes, varying cell type composition, or other tissue features.",
    "Note: Homogenization times are generally no longer than 30 s, but in some instances the blending time will be determined empirically. The solid tissue fragments must be sufficiently blended to create a liquid sample capable of being aspirated by a 10 mL pipette or poured into a storage tube (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]). The suggested blender model will only function if the lid of the blender is properly closed and the blender base is properly situated.\nNote: In our experience, blender bases will need to be replaced periodically in clinical practice (about every 3–6 months).\nPause Point: The homogenized samples can be stored long term at −80°C or for many months at 4°C. The samples are assumed to be stable due to formalin fixation; however, stability will need to be evaluated for specific downstream applications.\nOptional enrichment of tumor nuclei\nTiming: 5 h\nEnrichment of tumor nuclei improves detection of low frequency variants. This step can be skipped, if desired (e.g., if tumor cellularity is assumed to be high, or if the workflow must be kept simple).\nCollect tumor tissue.\nTransfer 1 mL of homogenized tumor tissue from the 50 mL conical tube into a 15 mL conical tube using a 1 mL pipette tip. It will be necessary to widen the opening in the pipette tip by cutting off about 0.25 cm from the narrow end using scissors or a razor blade.\nCentrifuge at 1000 × g for 2 min.\nDiscard liquid, and keep tissue. Weigh tissue and record weight for yield calculation. Add more tissue as needed.\nDe-crosslink tissue.\nResuspend tissue in CC1 buffer, 5:1 volume to mass.\nHeat at 80°C for 30 min.\nDigest tissue with Proteinase K.\nRemove from heat block, centrifuge at 500 × g for 3 min and discard supernatant.",
    "Resuspend digested tissue in 10 mL 1× PBS to wash, centrifuge at 500 × g for 3 min and remove PBS.\nResuspend in 1 mg/mL proteinase K solution (1:1 volume to mass).\nIncubate at 50°C for 10 min.\nWhile tissue is incubating, prepare 5 mg/mL pepsin in 150 mM NaCl, pH 1.5.\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 3 min to collect partially digested tissues; remove supernatant.\nDigest tissue and quench digestion with Pepsin.\nResuspend tissue in 5 mg/mL pepsin, pH 1.5. Adjust pH to 1.5–2, if necessary, using 1–5 μL 1M HCl per 1 mL digestion; pH strips can be used to estimate the pH.\nIncubate 30 min at 37°C. Gently agitate the tube every 10 min if tissue settles during the incubation.\nAdjust pH to above 8 with 5 M NaOH. For a 1 mL digestion, this typically requires 6 μL 5 M NaOH.\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 3 min to collect partially digested tissues; remove supernatant.\nNote: See troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]\nCollect nuclei and determine yield.\nExchange into 1 mL wash buffer.\nFilter through a 20 μm pluriselect filter, washing through the filter with 5 mL wash buffer, to collect nuclei. Use a 30 mL syringe to draw the liquid through the filter using a pluriselect filter ring.\nNote: See troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]\nCollect nuclei by centrifugation at 300 × g for 3 min\nCount nuclei on coulter counter, hemacytometer, or other quantification system to determine yield. Typical yields are 50–300 × 106 nuclei per gram of tissue.\nFACS sort to enrich tumor nuclei.\nMeasure out desired number of nuclei (suggested 10–20 × 106 nuclei per tube) into a fresh microcentrifuge tube, including tubes for both negative staining control and stained nuclei.",
    "Centrifuge at 300 × g for 3 min to collect nuclei. Exchange into 300 μL of antibody diluent as a blocking buffer for 10 min at 20°C.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 3 min to collect nuclei. Remove blocking buffer and exchange into 100 μL of mouse anti-cytokeratin 8/18 antibody for 1 h at 4°C (or 100 μL of antibody diluent for negative control).\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 3 min to collect nuclei. Remove antibody solution and resuspend cells in 500 μL of antibody staining wash buffer. Repeat this step twice to remove any residual antibody.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 3 min to collect nuclei. Remove antibody staining wash buffer and exchange both positive and negative control cells into 100 μL of goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 (2 μg/mL) and DAPI (3 μM) in antibody diluent for 30 min at 4°C.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 3 min to collect nuclei. Remove antibody solution and resuspend nuclei in 500 μL of antibody wash buffer. Repeat this step twice to remove any residual antibody.\nPipette through a 40 μm filter cap tube prior to analysis on a BD FACS Aria or similar flow cytometer.\nEnrich tumor nuclei by gating on the cytokeratin positive population with high side scatter (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]). Use the DAPI fluorescence for doublet discrimination, and use the negative control sample to help determine the position of the gating for the CK-positive stain.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/755-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Flow cytometry gating strategy for enriched tumor nuclei\n(A) Control un-stained nuclei.",
    "(B) CK staining intensity (AF647) vs. side scatter (SSC) for nuclei stained with anti-CK 8/18 antibody, visualized with Alexa Fluor 647. Gates were established for CK-positive (purple) and CK-negative, low-SSC (blue) nuclei. (c) DAPI staining intensity for the CK-negative (blue) and –positive (purple) populations defined by the gates in (b).\nCollect 0.3–1 × 106 nuclei in order to prepare around 0.3–1 μg of DNA for sequencing library prep.\nCentrifuge at 1000 × g for 10 min to collect nuclei. Remove all but ∼50–100 μL buffer. Transfer to a 1 mL tube and freeze, if not used immediately for preparation of DNA.\nNote: This enrichment strategy is only useful for carcinomas, which retain cytokeratin from their epithelial cell of origin. Other nuclear markers may be used for tumors of mesenchymal origin.\nPause Point: It is possible to pause after preparation of nuclei, or after staining. These nuclei must be stored in 0.5 mL nuclei stabilization buffer at 4°C and used within 1 week. Tumor-enriched nuclei can be stored for months at −80°C before DNA prep.\nPreparation of DNA from representative samples or enriched tumor nuclei\nTiming: 1.5 days\nExtraction of DNA ahead of standard DNA sequencing library prep.\nCollect tissue or nuclei by centrifugation\nNote: See troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11]\nTissue collection from homogenate samples: using a pipette tip with the end cut to widen the tip, pipette 100 μL of tissue homogenate into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Centrifuge at 1000 × g to collect the tissue, and discard the supernatant layer from the top of the sample. If the collected tissue is less than 50 μL, measure out and collect an additional aliquot of homogenate until the collected tissue measures in the range of 50–100 μL.\nNuclei collection from tumor-enriched samples: see above optional enrichment of tumor nuclei.",
    "Digest tissue or nuclei with proteinase K for 24 h at 56°C. Buffers from a Qiagen QIAamp FFPE kit can be used for this step. Add 180 μL of buffer ATL and 20 μL of proteinase K for DNA purification from nuclei. Add 360 μL of buffer ATL and 40 μL of proteinase K for DNA purification from homogenate; following digestion, split the digested material into two columns and process in parallel.\nIncubate digested tissue at 90°C for 1 h to inactivate proteinase K.\nAllow sample to cool to 20°C–22°C. Add 2 μL of RNase A (100 mg/mL) for 2 min at 20°C–22°C.\nAdd 200 μL buffer AL to each sample; mix by vortexing. Add 200 μL ethanol and mix again by vortexing.\nCarefully transfer the lysate to the center of a QIAamp minelute column in a 2 mL collection tube. From this step, follow the QIAamp manufacturer’s protocol to bind and wash DNA on the column.\nCheck the DNA concentration and fragment size distribution using standard Qubit and Bioanalyzer methods.\nProceed to sequencing library preparation for the selected method of analysis and platform, or store DNA at −20 to −80°C for use at a later date.\nNote: It is critical to digest both tissue and nuclei with proteinase K for 24 h. Using shorter digest times may appear to completely digest the tissue or nuclei, but it will significantly decrease the genomic DNA yield upon completion of the protocol.\nNote: In order to extract the maximal amount of DNA from tumor-enriched nuclei, collect a second elution from the column, as optionally described in the QIAamp protocol.",
    "Pause Point: It is possible to pause after tissue digestion and proceed to the column step at a later date, storing digests at −20°C. It is also possible to pause after DNA preparation before checking DNA concentration and fragmentation."
