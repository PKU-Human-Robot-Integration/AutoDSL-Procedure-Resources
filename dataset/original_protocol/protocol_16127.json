    "Metabolic profiling using GC-MS allows high accuracy and sensitivity in the analysis of highly complex mixtures of compounds, such as plant tissue samples, permitting identification and robust quantification of metabolites from a single extract. GC-MS has relatively extensive coverage of compounds involved in the central pathways of primary metabolism, such as sugars, sugar alcohols, amino acids, organic acids, and polyamines. It is the most widely used technique for plant metabolomics, and solid protocols for machine set-up, sample preparation, analysis, and chromatogram evaluation have been developed.\nThe protocol presented here is carried out essentially as previously described by Lisec, Schauer, Kopka, Willmitzer, & Fernie (2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-bib-0026]), with modifications specific for freeze-dried cassava tissue samples (Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-prot-0002]). Metabolite profiles are in general expressed as ratios, with data compared with a control sample. This protocol can also be used for absolute quantification when authentic standards with different amounts of each compound are included in each batch of samples.\nMaterials\nHomogenized, ground, and freeze-dried cassava tissue (source leaves, sink leaves, upper stems, and/or roots; see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-prot-0002])\n100% methanol (gradient grade for liquid chromatography; Merck, CAS 67-56-1)\nRibitol (Sigma, CAS 488-81-3)\nChloroform (CHCl3; for liquid chromatography; Merck, CAS 67-66-3)\nUltrapure (∼0.055 µS/cm; e.g., generated by Milli-Q Reference System)\nArgon 5.0 (Messer-Griesheim) or another inert gas\nStandard compound mixtures (for absolute quantification of metabolites by GC-MS; see Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-prot-0003])\n20 mg/ml methoxyamine hydrochloride (Sigma, CAS 593-56-6) in pyridine (Merck, CAS 110-86-1)\nMSTFA (N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide, Macherey and Nagel, CAS 24589-78-4)\nFatty-acid methyl esters (FAMEs; see Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-prot-0004])\nHelium 5.0 carrier gas\nAnalytical scale\n2.0-ml screw-cap tubes (e.g., Sarstedt, 72.693)\n70°C Thermomixer (e.g., Eppendorf Thermomixer comfort) or thermostable water bath\nMicrocentrifuge\nGlass tubes with screw caps (e.g., 6-ml tubes, DURAN, 231751159)\nVortex\nStandard tabletop centrifuge\n1.5-ml tubes (e.g., Eppendorf Safe-Lock microcentrifuge tubes)",

Weigh out 10 mg (±1 mg) of each homogenized, ground, and freeze-dried cassava tissue in a 2.0-ml screw-cap tube. Prepare an additional empty tube as a blank.\nThe precise weight must be noted for data normalization.\n2. Make a mixture of 1400 µl of 100% methanol and 60 µl ribitol (stock concentration of 0.2 mg/ml) per sample. Pre-cool to −20°C.\nAlways calculate for two samples more than you have.\n3. Pipet 1460 µl cold methanol-ribitol solution onto each cassava tissue sample.\n4. Shake at 1000 rpm for 15 min at 70°C using a Thermomixer or thermostable water bath.\nIf a thermostable water bath is used, the samples will need to be occasionally mixed by hand.\n5. Centrifuge 10 min at 20,000 × g.\n6. Transfer supernatant to a glass tube with a screw cap.\n7. Add 750 µl chloroform.\n8. Add 1500 µl ultrapure water and thoroughly vortex for 15 s.\n9. Centrifuge 15 min at 4000 × g.\n10. Using long pipet tips, transfer two 200-µl aliquots from upper phase (polar phase) into 1.5-ml tubes.\nOne aliquot will be used for derivatization and the other stored as backup.",
    "11. Transfer six 200-µl aliquots from blank tube into fresh 1.5-ml tubes.\n12. Dry aliquots of samples as well as blanks and standard compound mixtures in a vacuum concentrator for ≥3 hr (or overnight), without heating. Immediately after drying the aliquots, flush tubes with argon 5.0 or another inert gas and close tubes tightly. Store tubes at −80°C until derivatization.\nDerivatization (ONLY the polar phase)\n13. Place dry aliquots of samples as well as blanks and standard compound mixtures stored at −80°C in a vacuum concentrator or air-flow sample concentrator for 30 min before derivatization.\nTubes should be immediately and tightly closed to avoid absorption of water or moisture during derivatization. Even minor contamination with water will lead to inconsistent results.\nInclude dried blank samples and, in case of absolute quantification, include independent quantitative controls with at least three different concentrations (see Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-prot-0003]). For cassava samples, we recommend standards with final amounts of 250, 500, and 1000 ng.\n14. Add 40 µl of 20 mg/ml methoxyamine hydrochloride in pyridine to the dry aliquots (samples, blanks, and quantitative controls).\n15. Shake at 950 rpm for 2 hr at 37°C using a Thermomixer.\n16. Spin down briefly to collect drops on the cap into the main bulk.\n17. Prepare MSTFA mix (1 ml MSTFA + 20 µl FAMEs) and add 70 µl to each tube.\n18. Shake at 950 rpm for 30 min at 37°C using a Thermomixer.\n19. Spin down briefly to collect drops on the cap.\n20. Transfer contents into a 1.1-ml GC-MS sample vial with a screw-top lid.\nKeep the samples at room temperature until and during the run to avoid water condensation.\nGC-TOF/MS",
    "21. Using a gas chromatograph, a split and splitless injector with electronic pressure control up to 150 psi, an autosampler system, and a Pegasus III GC-TOF/MS mass analyzer, inject 1 µl sample into a capillary column at 230°C in splitless and split (1:30 ratio) modes using a conical single-taper split/splitless liner, with the helium 5.0 carrier gas flow set to 2 ml/min. Keep flow rate constant with electronic pressure control enabled. Include syringe-washing steps before and after each injection in injection program.\nFor cassava material, due to high metabolite concentrations, a splitless-mode GC-MS run causes overloaded peaks for some compounds, such as sucrose and/or malate, depending on the tissue. Therefore, in order to accurately measure both high- and low-abundance metabolites, we recommend that the injection also be done in split mode. A split ratio of 1:30 means that one-thirtieth of the sample will go to the column.\n22. Perform chromatography using a temperature program of isothermal for 2 min at 80°C, followed by a 15°C/min ramp to 330°C, holding at this temperature for 6 min, and then cooling as rapidly as instrument specifications allow. Set transfer-line and ion-source temperatures to 250°C.\n23. Set recorded mass to be m/z 70 to 600 scanning range at 20 scans/s. Set remaining monitored chromatography time to proceed with a 180-s solvent delay, with filaments turned off. Set manual mass defect to 0, filament bias current to −70 V, and detector voltage to about 1700 to 1850 V. Tune instrument automatically according to the manufacturer's instructions.",
    "24. Use Chroma TOF 1.0 software or equivalent for visualization of chromatograms and export of .cdf files compatible with further analysis. Create a list of average retention times of each FAME, using mass 87 as a reference, for calculation of the retention index (RI) and correction of each chromatogram separately in subsequent steps.\n25. Perform target analysis of cassava metabolites.\nWe recommend using TagFinder 4.0 software (Luedemann, Strassburg, Erban, & Kopka, 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-bib-0027]). TagFinder is freely available for academic use, and a detailed description of use is available in Luedemann, von Malotky, Erban, & Kopka (2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-bib-0028]). In summary, the TagFinder workflow includes import of fragment-ion data (mass, time and arbitrary abundance, intensity) from a chromatography file interchange format, e.g., .cdf files; annotation of sample information and grouping of samples into classes; RI calculation; binning of observed fragment ions of equal mass from different chromatograms into RI windows; combination of these bins, or so-called mass tags, into time groups of co-eluting fragment ions; testing of time groups for intensity-correlated mass tags; data matrix generation; and extraction of selective mass tags supported by compound identification.\n26. Once the data matrix has been exported for the samples and standards, correct values relative to the internal standard, ribitol, by dividing each metabolite value by the ribitol value in each sample. To generate standard curves, plot values for the standard mixes and the amounts of metabolites used. Calculate absolute values for each metabolite from the curves, with final values divided by the sample weight.\nThe resulting values are in µg/mg dry weight (DW).",
    "Freeze-drying (lyophilization or cryodesiccation) is a dehydration process at low temperature and pressure. It is an excellent method for preserving material after the material has been harvested and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Several protocols in this article (Basic Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-prot-0001] to 9[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-prot-0014] and Alternate Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-prot-0008]) have been adjusted to apply to freeze-dried material in order to allow processing of field harvest samples that typically require long-distance transport. Freeze-dried material can be transported at room temperature and weighs significantly less than non-freeze-dried material, making it more convenient.\nMaterials\nCassava tissue (e.g., source leaves, sink leaves, upper stems, and/or roots)\nLiquid nitrogen\nDry ice (optional)\nCutting tool (optional)\nPolyvials (e.g., liquid nitrogen–safe 20-ml polyvials, Zinsser Analytic, 3071401) or equivalent container for harvest\nFreeze drier with vacuum pump (e.g., Christ, model Alpha 2-4)\nAnalytical scale\nMixer mill (Retsch, model MM 300, https://www.retsch.com[href=https://www.retsch.com])\nSteel balls (e.g., 5- to 7-mm diameter, Th. Geyer, https://www.thgeyer.com/en/[href=https://www.thgeyer.com/en/])\nPaper tissue (e.g., Kimwipes, KIMTECH Science, 107281)\nElastic bands\nVacuum bags\nDesiccator\n1. Harvest appropriate cassava tissue according to the experimental aim.\n2. For thick materials such as storage roots, cut tissue into small pieces before placing it into a polyvial or equivalent container for harvest.\n3. Immediately freeze tissue in liquid nitrogen and store at −80°C until further processing.\n4. Turn on and set up freeze drier with a vacuum pump in advance according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n5. Place sample on dry ice or in a container of liquid nitrogen. Prepare sample for the freeze drier by removing the lid and then quickly place it into freeze drier.\nSamples must remain frozen during preparation.\nSamples must be open to the air during freeze-drying to allow water sublimation.\n6. Freeze-dry until completely dry. To verify if the sample is fully dried, weigh sample periodically until a constant weight is noted.",
    "The freeze-drying time for cassava material varies greatly according to the tissue type and amount, from 2 to 3 days for leaves and from 4 to 5 days for small storage-root pieces.\n7. Grind sample using a mixer mill and steel balls until a fine powder forms. During the grinding process, keep sample at low temperature by periodically cooling with liquid nitrogen or dry ice.\n8. Freeze-dry ground sample again (see steps 4 to 6) for ≥2 days to ensure complete removal of water before aliquoting. To avoid loss or cross-contamination of the material during this process, remove lid and cover container with paper tissue fixed with an elastic band. Close container with the corresponding lid immediately after removing it from the freeze drier.\n9. Aliquot material according to amount specified in the chosen protocol (Basic Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-prot-0001] to 9[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-prot-0014] or Alternate Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-prot-0008]).\n10. For long-term storage, store material under vacuum in vacuum bags in a desiccator at 4°C.",
    "Metabolite profiles are in general expressed as ratios, with data compared with a control sample. However, absolute quantification is possible when authentic standards are included, allowing generation of standard curves (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-prot-0001], step 26). Here, we present the complete list of metabolites that we have used for absolute quantification of cassava metabolites. These metabolites are divided into two mixes to avoid overlap of specific metabolites due to similar retention times.\nMaterials\nStandard metabolite solutions (1 mg/ml each; see Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-tbl-0001])\n2.5:1 methanol/water solution (methanol gradient grade for liquid chromatography; Merck, CAS 67-56-1; ultrapure water, ∼0.055 µS/cm; e.g., generated by Milli-Q Reference System)\n0.2 mg/ml ribitol (Sigma, CAS 488-81-3)\nArgon 5.0 (Messer-Griesheim) or another inert gas\n15-ml Falcon tubes\n1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes\nVacuum concentrator (e.g., SpeedVac, Thermo Fischer Scientific)\nTable 1.\n                Standard Compounds for Absolute Quantification of Metabolites by Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)\ntable:\n﻿Mix,Metabolite,GMDa[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-tbl1-note-0001_43] ref. no.,ChEBIb[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-tbl1-note-0002_44] ID,Molecular weight (g/mol),CAS no.,Supplier,Cat. no.\n1,2-Oxoglutaric acid,R002922,30915,146.11,328-50-7,Sigma,K1128\n1,Alanine,R000072,16449,89.1,56-41-7,Sigma,A7627\n1,Arginine,R003205,29016,174.2,7200-25-1,Sigma,A8094\n1,Asparagine,R000314,22653,132.12,70-47-3,Sigma,A0884\n1,Aspartate,R000384,22660,133.1,56-84-8,Sigma,A8949\n1,β-Alanine,R001368,16958,89.09,107-95-9,Sigma,A7752\n1,Citrate,R000112,30769,192.12,77-92-9,Sigma,C4540\n1,Erythritol,R000642,17113,122.12,149-32-6,Supelco,R-422470\n1,Fructose,R001682,28757,180.2,57-48-7,Sigma,F0127\n1,Fumarate,R000659,18012,116.1,110-17-8,Sigma,F2752\n1,4-Amino-butyric acid (GABA),R003031,16865,103.12,56-12-2,Sigma,A5835\n1,Galactinol,R003201,17505,342.3,16908-86-4,Sigma,79544\n1,Glucose,R001393,17234,180.2,50-99-7,Sigma,G8270\n1,Glutamate,R000687,18237,147.1,56-86-0,Sigma,G1251\n1,Glutamine,R000689,28300,146.15,56-85-9,Sigma,G3126\n1,Glycerol,R000680,17754,92.09,56-81-5,Sigma,G5516\n1,Glycerol-3P,R002017,15978,172.014,57-03-4,Wako,198-02052\n1,Glycine,R000681,15428,75.1,56-40-6,Sigma,G7126\n1,Histidine,R001410,27570,155.16,4998-57-6,Sigma,53330\n1,Isoleucine,R000732,24898,131.2,73-32-5,Sigma,I2752\n1,Leucine,R003029,25017,131.2,61-90-5,Sigma,L8000\n1,Lysine,R000063,25094,146.2,923-27-3,Sigma,L8021\n1,Malate,R000108,6650,134.1,97-67-6,Sigma,M6413\n1,Methionine,R003032,16811,149.21,63-68-3,Sigma,M9625\n1,Myo-inositol,R000105,17268,180.2,87-89-8,Sigma,I5125\n1,Ornithine,R000464,18257,132.16,3184-13-2,Sigma,O4386\n1,Phenylalanine,R002940,28044,165.2,673-06-3,Sigma,P1751\n1,Phosphate,,26078,97.99,7664-38-2,Carl Roth,6366\n1,Proline,R001417,26271,115.13,344-25-2,Sigma,81705\n1,Putrescine,R000182,17148,88.2,333-93-7,Sigma,P7505\n1,Pyruvate,R003170,32816,88.1,113-24-6,Sigma,P8574\n1,Raffinose,R003156,16634,504.42,17629-30-0,Sigma,R0250\n1,Serine,R001418,17822,105.1,312-84-5,Sigma,84970\n1,Succinate,R000114,15741,118.1,110-15-6,Sigma,S3674\n1,Sucrose,R000523,17992,342.3,57-50-1,Sigma,S9378\n1,Trehalose,R002802,16551,342.3,6138-23-4,Sigma,T9531\n1,Tryptophan,R000539,27897,204.22,73-22-3,Sigma,T0254\n1,Tyrosine,R000511,18186,181.19,60-18-4,Sigma,T3754\n1,Valine,R000541,27266,117.2,72-18-4,Sigma,V0500\n1,Xylose,R000094,18222,150.13,58-86-6,Sigma,X1500\n2,Benzoate,R000565,30746,122.12,65-85-0,Sigma,242381\n2,3-Trans-caffeoylquinic acid (chlorogenic acid),R000125,16112,354.31,327-97-9,Sigma,C3878\n2,Cis-caffeic acid,,17395,180.16,331-39-5,Sigma,C0625\n2,Fucose,R000096,33984,164.16,3615-37-0,Sigma,F8150\n2,Galactonolactone,R000122,15895,178.14,1668-08-2,Sigma,5313\n2,Glycerate,R000686,33508,106.1,6057-35-8,Sigma,50032\n2,Glycolate,R000683,17497,76.05,79-14-1,Sigma,G8284\n2,Homoserine,R000037,30653,119.12,1927-25-9,Sigma,H6515\n2,Lactate,R000802,28358,90.1,10326-41-7,Sigma,L0625\n2,Linamarin,R000410,16441,247.248,9008-22-4,Sigma,L9634\n2,Maleate,R000433,18300,116.07,110-16-7,Sigma,92816\n2,Maltose,R000438,17306,342.3,6363-53-7,Sigma,M5885\n2,N-acetyl-serine,R000039,45441,147.129,97-14-3,Sigma,A2638\n2,Nicotinate,R000542,15940,123.1,59-67-6,Merck,481918\n2,O-acetyl-serine,R000042,17981,147.129,66638-22-0,Sigma,A6262\n2,4-Hydroxy-cinnamate (p-coumaric acid),R000198,32374,164.047,501-98-4,Sigma,55823\n2,Quinic acid,R000474,26493,192.17,77-95-2,Sigma,138622\n2,Rhamnose,R000104,26546,164.16,6155-35-7,Sigma,R3875\n2,Shikimate,R003041,16119,174.15,138-59-0,Sigma,S5375\n2,Threonate,R002093,15908,136.1,7306-96-9,Sigma,380644\n2,Threonine,R000538,26986,119.12,80-68-2,Sigma,T8625\n2,Trans-caffeic acid,R001373,16433,180.16,331-39-5,Sigma,60018\n2,Urea,R002926,16199,60.06,57-13-6,Sigma,U5378\na GMD, Golm Metabolome Database (http://gmd.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/[href=http://gmd.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/]).\nb ChEBI, Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/[href=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/]).\nMix 1 (40 compounds)\n1.

    "Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-prot-0001] uses FAMEs as retention-time standards for calculation of the RI. The RI is a crucial parameter for peak assignment and for avoiding false peak annotations (Lisec et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-bib-0026]). Due to expected variance in absolute retention times, each chromatogram must be corrected for retention times separately using the RI. Alternatively to FAMEs, alkanes or fatty acids can be used.

The individual metabolites are quantified via their respective areas under the HPLC peak curve. For precise quantification, different dilutions of the standard mixture should be included in measurements at the beginning, at the end, and approximately every 10 to 20 samples. Spike-in experiments are performed in order to check for extraction losses and matrix effects. Because not every metabolite is extracted with equal efficiency and because metabolites may behave differently during measurement, every metabolite should be checked for its extraction and measurement efficiency by adding a known amount of the analytically pure substance prior to extraction. By calculating the ratio of measured substance to input substance, the efficiency can be determined for each metabolite, and accuracy of measurement can be ensured.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-prot-0005])\nAnalytical-grade metabolites (∼5 mg each; e.g., from Sigma-Aldrich)\nStandard mix preparation\n1.

    "Generally, sugars are water soluble and fuel various metabolic pathways with carbon and energy. Thus, they can be converted to other carbohydrates, like starch or cellulose, or they provide substrates for main metabolic routes, like glycolysis or the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. These two pathways generate precursors for amino-acid synthesis, making plants able to be fully photoautotrophic. The levels of sugars, starch, and amino acids are thus, on the one hand, indicative of the metabolic state of cells or tissues and, on the other hand, influence plant growth, organ development, and overall yield. Therefore, it is of great importance to gain knowledge on the levels of sugars, starch, and amino acids in various cassava tissues under selected conditions.\nHere, we describe an easy-to-follow protocol that can be used for a large number of samples in a short period of time and that allows extraction of soluble sugars and amino acids in one extraction.

    "In order to quantify starch and sugars, perchloric-acid extraction is ideal, as all enzymes that may metabolize carbohydrates are immediately inactivated. Additionally, compared to ethanol extraction (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-prot-0007]), fewer pigments get extracted alongside sugars, leading to lower background during further quantification. The extraction protocol presented is optimized for cassava tissues and is derived from our previously described method (Hostettler et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-bib-0021]). Starch (in the digested pellet) and sucrose, glucose, and fructose (in the supernatant) can then be quantified with an enzyme-based glucose assay (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-fig-0001]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f894104c-0b4b-4d75-ade6-f5ef9b874fe3/cppb20102-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nEnzyme-based glucose assay to sequentially determine glucose, fructose, and sucrose content. Hexokinase (HEX) uses ATP to phosphorylate glucose to glucose 6-phosphate (G6P). Subsequently, G6P dehydrogenase (G6PDH) converts G6P to 6-phosphogluconate (6-PGA) and simultaneously reduces an equimolar amount of NAD+ to NADH. NADH, but not NAD+, absorbs light with a wavelength of 340 nm. Hence, NADH production can be monitored spectrophotometrically. In parallel, fructose is converted to fructose 6-phosphate (F6P). Upon addition of phosphoglucomutase (PGI), F6P is converted to G6P, leading to another rise in NADH. In a similar manner, upon addition of β-fructosidase, sucrose will be converted into fructose and glucose that will be converted by other enzymes, as described above, leading to NADH production. NADH can be detected at 340 nm.\nMaterials\nFreeze-dried cassava tissue or frozen and powdered cassava tissue (source leaves, sink leaves, upper stems, and/or roots; see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-prot-0002])\n0.7 M perchloric acid [4.2% (v/v), prepared from 11.6 M/70% perchloric acid, Sigma, CAS 7601-90-3), 4°C\nDeionized water\n2 M KOH (Sigma, CAS 1310-58-3)/0.4 M MES (Sigma, CAS 145224-94-8), 4°C\n80% (v/v) and 100% ethanol (puriss. p.a.), 4°C\nStarch digestion mix (see recipe; make fresh)\nGlucose assay mix (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-rec-0003])\nGlucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH; grade II, from Leuconostoc mesenteroides, 1000 U/ml; Roche, 10165875001)",

Nevertheless, it is advisable to determine the needed number of extractions for each type of sample and experiment independently, and therefore, it is important to store the pellet on ice until protein determination.\n9.

Label fresh 1.5-ml reaction tubes according to samples.\n13a. For cassava leaves: Pipet 975 µl of 1× staining solution into a labeled tube for each sample.

Read amount of protein in the samples on the calibration curve (in µg/ml). Multiply this value by protein extraction buffer volume (in ml; e.g., 0.25 or 1 ml) divided by the sample weight (in mg).\nThe resulting value is in µg/mg, which equals mg/g.",
    "A universal method for optimal extraction of all plant secondary metabolites is presently not feasible. The complexity, physical and chemical diversity, dynamic range, instability, and turnover preclude a single extraction and analytical platform for secondary metabolites. The extraction method provided below enables fast and reliable detection of a broad range of chemical classes. Furthermore, the method facilitates analysis of the same extracts on multiple/complementary analytical platforms without the necessity of repeating the extraction process. The extraction is based on liquid-liquid partition of immiscible solvents of different polarities, which facilitates extraction of polar and semi-polar compounds separately from non-polar metabolites in a single extraction.\nChromatographic methods based on reverse-phase mode provide good resolution of cassava's most-cited secondary metabolites, such as cyanogenic glycosides, flavonoids, hydroxycinnamic acids, lignans, hydroxybenzoates, and glycosylated apocarotenoids (Drapal, Barros de Carvalho, Ovalle Rivera, Becerra Lopez-Lavalle, & Fraser, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-bib-0012]). These compounds are amenable to detection with MS using electrospray ionization in either negative or positive mode. Numerous methods describing analysis of secondary metabolites can be found in the literature, but generally, chromatographic separation can be achieved using a linear gradient of acidified water and acetonitrile or methanol on a C18 analytical column.\nRegarding quantification, a general approach is to use relative quantification of molecular features by normalizing against the internal standard. Typically, accurate quantification methods are applied after statistical assessment of metabolomics datasets, which generates a list of candidate molecular features significantly associated with the trait of interest. Once compounds are identified, accurate quantification can be performed using internal- or external-standard calibration curves.\nMaterials\nFreeze-dried cassava tissue (leaves, stems, and/or roots; see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-prot-0002])\nLC-MS-grade water (Fisher Scientific, 10728098)\nMethanol (HPLC grade; Fisher Scientific, M/4056/17)\nChloroform (CHCl3; Fisher Scientific, C/4920/17)\nNitrogen (N2) stream (optional)\n0.2 mg/ml genistein in ethanol (Extrasynthese, 1372S)",

For freeze-dried cassava leaves: Grind freeze-dried tissue using a TissueRuptor.\nGrinding for a long time may damage the tissue, as the disposable probes can get hot during the process. To minimize this effect, avoid grinding times longer than 30 to 60 s or keep the sample tube on ice. This grinding method is usually quick, taking <1 min for cassava leaves.\nThis first grinding step reduces the size of the sample/tissue considerably, allowing the tissue to be transferred to smaller tubes.\n1b. For more sturdy tissue, such as cassava stems and roots: Grind freeze-dried tissue with a blade grinder or other alternative to the TissueRuptor.\nJust as described for the TissueRuptor, care must be taken to not overheat the tissue during the grinding process.\nAs noted above, this first grinding step reduces the size of the sample/tissue considerably, allowing the tissue to be transferred to smaller tubes.",
    "2. Transfer tissue to a screw-capped 2-ml polypropylene tube. Mince tissue to a fine powder in a TissueLyser LT through rapid movement of stainless-steel beads in the tube. Once a fine powder is achieved, remove and recycle stainless-steel beads and keep dried powdered tissue in the screw-capped tube at −80°C.\nTypically, 1 min of shaking and a frequency of 30/s produce a fine-particle powder.\nTwo-step grinding is required to achieve a fine powder. The first step (step 1) involves grinding the tissue to a small-to-medium particle size, and the tissue is then further reduced to a fine powder in the second step (step 2).\nExtraction of secondary metabolites\n3. Weigh out 10 mg (±1 mg) dried powdered tissue (leaves, stems, or roots; see steps 1 and 2) in a 2-ml microcentrifuge tube per sample. Prepare an additional empty tube as a blank for the extraction.\nKeep a record of the precise weight for future normalization.\n4.

Add 800 µl chloroform and mix well using a vortex.\nThe volumes indicated in steps 4 and 6 can be altered/optimized as long as the ratio of the solvents is kept at 1:1:2, i.e., one volume of water, one volume of methanol, and two volumes of chloroform. This extraction method is adapted from the classic Bligh and Dyer method (Bligh & Dyer, 1959[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-bib-0004]).\n7. Centrifuge 3 min at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge to allow phase separation.\n8. Recover top phase (epiphase), containing polar and semi-polar metabolites, and filter through a 2-mm syringe filter with a 0.45-µm nylon membrane using a 1-ml syringe.",
    "9. Place filtered extract in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and analyze immediately or store at −20°C until analysis.\nTo preclude/exclude degradation artifacts, it is recommended to analyze samples fresh, ideally on the same day as preparation. If storage is necessary, do not store for >1 week.\n10. Recover lower organic layer (hypophase), containing non-polar metabolites, and discard middle layer, which contains precipitated proteins and other non-extracted compounds/macromolecules.\nThe latter may require additional acid, alkaline, or enzymatic treatments (see Basic Protocol 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-prot-0011]).\n11. Transfer organic layer to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and dry under an N2 stream or using a vacuum centrifuge.\nThis extract can be used for analysis of carotenoids, chlorophylls, and tocopherol (see Basic Protocol 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-prot-0013]). Samples can be stored for up to 2 weeks at −20°C if analysis is delayed.\nAnalysis by LC-MS\n12. Prior to analysis, centrifuge methanolic extract (epiphase; see steps 8 and 9) for 5 min at maximum speed to clean up sample.\nThe clean-up entails removal of any particles that could block the column during LC analysis.\n13. Transfer an aliquot of clean extract to a conical glass insert mounted in a screw-capped 2-ml glass vial.\n14. Spike extract with internal standard (0.2 mg/ml genistein in ethanol) so that the final concentration in the vial is 0.01 mg/ml and the spiked volume is <5% of the total volume to avoid dilution effects on the sample's metabolites.\nTypically, we spike 5 µl internal standard into 200 µl extract.\n15. Close vial with a cap with a PTFE/red silicone septum.\n16. Use an injection volume of ≤5 µl for analysis in an LC-MS system with an electrospray source. To prevent degradation artifacts, keep sample at 6°C in the automated sampler.",
    "The injection volume varies across different mass spectrometers and is directly related to the sensitivity of the detector.\nIn the case of blockage of the LC column, the sample needs to be re-filtered (see step 8).\n17. Perform chromatographic separation of cassava's secondary metabolites using a linear gradient of acidified (0.01% to 0.1% formic acid) water (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B) on a reverse-phase C18 analytical column operating at 30° to 35°C and a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min.\nThe method run time is 30 min but is transferrable to 5-cm columns and higher flow rates (typically, 0.4 to 0.5 ml/min) to achieve shorter run times (6 to 10 min) and enable high-throughput analysis of large sample sets.\nIn the case that large variation between replicates is observed, the tissue might not have been ground sufficiently, or pipetting was not consistent. If chromatographic peaks are too broad/have a flat top, the sample is too concentrated and needs dilution to the appropriate level. If metabolites are detected in the blank extraction, contamination of solvents is possible, which requires re-extraction with new solvents.\nDetection of the cassava's above-mentioned secondary metabolites on a Q-TOF or ion-trap mass spectrometer using an electrospray source is feasible but not restricted to these two platforms. Both systems have tandem MS capability (MS/MS) that facilitates characterization of compounds based on the fragmentation pattern of selected parent ions. Q-TOF and Orbitrap mass spectrometers present the advantage of providing accurate monoisotopic masses and chemical formulae, and ion traps provide the capability of multiple tandem fragmentation (MSn). For more detailed information regarding the different applications of MS to metabolomics analysis and related strategies, please refer to Lei, Huhman, & Sumner (2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-bib-0025]).\nQuantification",
    "18. For relative quantification, divide the area of each chemical feature's extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) (Ax) by the area of the internal standard's EIC (Ais) and the amount of analyte (Cx) calculated respective to the known amount of internal standard (Cis) added to the sample; this follows the classic formula of internal calibration: relative response factor (RRF) = [(Ax)(Cis)]/[(Ais)(Cx)].\nIn this case, the response factor is assumed to be 1 and the same for all chemical features detected.\n19. For accurate quantification of candidate molecular features, perform external and internal calibration.\nAn external calibration curve for each identified compound is generated by analyzing, under the same LC-MS conditions, a minimum of four calibration points, i.e., four increasing concentrations of the identified standard. EIC areas are then plotted against concentrations, and linear regression is performed. The slope of the resultant linear regression equation corresponds to the response factor. The range of the calibration curve's EIC areas should cover that observed in the samples and should follow a linear trend.\nInternal calibration is performed by analyzing, under the same LC-MS conditions, a minimum of four calibration points (as in external calibration). Each calibration point is spiked with a constant known amount of internal standard (Cis) before analysis. Plotting the ratio of the analyte's EIC area to the internal standard's EIC area (Ax/Ais) as a function of the analyte concentration of the standards and then performing linear regression would provide the corresponding response factor relative to the internal standard (RRF). The accurate amount of analyte X in the sample (Cx) is then calculated using the following equation for internal calibration: RRF = [(Ax)(Cis)]/[(Ais)(Cx)].",
    "Carotenoids represent the largest class of pigments found in nature and are present in bacteria, fungi, algae, higher plants, and animals. To date, over 700 carotenoid structures have been reported. Industrially, they are used across multiple commercial sectors as colorants, supplements, and bioactives. In plants, they act as potent antioxidants, ancillary photosynthetic pigments, and phytohormone precursors. An inherent problem associated with analysis of carotenoids is their poor ionization, which limits mass spectral determination. However, carotenoid pigments do have characteristic UV/Vis spectra due to the chromophore present in their chemical structure. This has been exploited through use of a photodiode array detector (PDA) coupled to on-line chromatographic separation. The method provided uses a routine ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) platform coupled to an on-line PDA.\nThe extraction method presented here is adapted from the classic Bligh and Dyer method (Bligh & Dyer, 1959[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-bib-0004]).

Perform external quantification by running external calibration curves of either commercial or purified standards.\nXanthophylls can be quantified using β-carotene's calibration curve at 450 nm.\nDetailed methodology for external calibration is described in Basic Protocol 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-prot-0012], step 19.",
    "Whereas Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-prot-0007] is useful for determining starch content in tissues, the protocol below allows assessment of the composition and structure of starch itself. These traits define properties of starch that influence its quality (e.g., viscosity), determining its end use.\nStarch is the main metabolite that accumulates in cassava storage roots. It is composed of two glucose polymers consisting of linear chains linked by α-1,4-bonds that can be branched with other chains by α-1,6-bonds. Amylose is the minor glucan polymer, composing ≤30% of the starch and containing few branch points, whereas amylopectin is the major glucan polymer, is highly branched, and gives rise to the semi-crystalline structure of starch (Pfister & Zeeman, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-bib-0031]). Glucan chains are naturally phosphorylated. The physicochemical properties of starch will influence the behavior of byproducts, such as the cooking quality of flour, or industrial applications of purified starch. We propose methods to assess the size of the starch granules, their amylose/amylopectin ratio, their chain-length distribution (CLD), and their phosphate content. The protocol presented here is optimized for cassava and is based on our previously described methods (Hostettler et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-bib-0021]) and adapted from an existing protocol (Cledat, Battu, Mokrini, & Cardot, 2004[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-bib-0010]).\nMaterials\nFreeze-dried cassava storage-root powder (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-prot-0003])\nStarch extraction buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-rec-0005])\nPercoll cushion: 95% (v/v) Percoll (Sigma, P1644) and 5% (v/v) 0.5 M Tris·HCl, pH 8.0\n0.5% (w/v) SDS\nUltrapure water (∼0.055 µS/cm; e.g., generated by Milli-Q Reference System)\n80% (v/v) ethanol\nSterile ultrapure water\n10% (v/v) Lugol solution (Sigma, 32922)\nDebranching mix (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-rec-0001]; make fresh)\nDowex 1X8-200 (Dowex 1; 200 to 400 mesh, ion-exchange resin; Acros Organics, CAS 12627-85-9)\nDowex 50X2-100 (Dowex 50; 100 to 200 mesh, ion-exchange resin; Acros Organics, CAS 12612-37-2)\n1 M sodium acetate (Sigma, CAS 127-09-03)\n2 M hydrochloric acid (HCl; Roth, CAS 7647-01-0)",

Weigh out 5 mg purified starch (see step 12) in a 1.5-ml reaction tube with a screw cap.\n18. Add 1 ml sterile ultrapure water and vortex thoroughly.\n19. Incubate at 1000 rpm for 10 min at 95°C using a Thermomixer.\nDuring this step, starch gelatinizes, which disrupts its semi-crystalline structure, rendering it accessible to Lugol solution.\n20. Immediately mix 5 µl gelatinized starch from step 19 with 200 µl of 10% Lugol solution in a 96-well flat-bottom microtiter plate.",
    "21. Record OD550 and OD618 values on a microtiter plate reader.\n22. Calculate percentage amylose content using the equation described for potato starch (Hovenkamp-Hermelink et al., 1988[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-bib-0022]):\n         imgsrc:/cms/asset/b96291b7-3e6d-4be3-bd85-78d31c5441ad/cppb20102-math-0003.png\nAfter staining with Lugol solution, amylose and amylopectin show different absorption spectra, depending on the amount of iodine bound and the type of complex formed between iodine and glucan secondary structures. When complexed with iodine, amylopectin has a wavelength of maximal absorbance (λmax) of 550 nm, whereas amylose has a λmax of 618 nm.\nAssessment of chain-length distribution\n23. Weigh out 0.2 mg purified starch (see step 12) in a 1.5-ml reaction tube with a screw cap.\nAssessment of CLD can also be done using the pellet obtained after starch extraction in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-prot-0007] or the Alternate Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-prot-0008] by using enough of the pellet to have 0.2 mg starch (to be determined after starch quantification).\n24. Add 450 µl sterile ultrapure water and vortex thoroughly.\n25. Incubate in a 95°C water bath for 15 min.\nDuring this step, starch gelatinizes, which disrupts its semi-crystalline structure, rendering it accessible to enzymes.\n26. Cool sample to 20°C and spin briefly to remove condensed water and residual insoluble material from the tube cap.\n27. Add 50 µl debranching mix to sample and mix well by vortexing.\nThis step hydrolyzes the α-1,6 linkages specifically.\n28. Shake at 400 rpm for 3 hr at 37°C using a Thermomixer.\n29. Stop reaction by heating the sample for 10 min in a 95°C water bath.\n30. Spin down cell debris and denatured enzymes by centrifuging 10 min at 10,000 × g and reserve supernatant.\nThe samples can be stored at this stage at −20°C.\n31. Prepare Dowex 1 and Dowex 50 ion-exchange columns to clean up the samples:",
    "Weigh out each Dowex resin (1 g per sample) into separate glass beakers.\nWash resins in an excess of sterile ultrapure water. Let resins settle and then pour off water.\nCharge Dowex 1 resin with 1 M sodium acetate and Dowex 50 resin with 2 M HCl using twice the resin volume. Stir for 30 min with a magnetic stir bar on a stir plate and then let resins settle.\nRemove supernatant and wash resins with excess sterile ultrapure water four times or until the pH of the supernatant is neutral.\nPrepare Dowex ion-exchange columns by stacking a Dowex 50 column above a Dowex 1 column. Place a 5-ml scintillation vial below the lower column.\nWe use in-house-made racks (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-fig-0003]) so that the flow drops directly from one column to the next. A cotton pellet is placed at the bottom of each column to prevent the resin from flowing out. We can fit 96 samples in one rack. For an alternative system, see Hostettler et al. (2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-bib-0021]).\nResuspend charged resins in an equal volume of sterile ultrapure water, making a slurry. Mix each resin with a magnetic stir bar on a stir plate while pipetting it into the appropriate column.\nThe clean-up entails removal of neutral compounds and retention of charged compounds.\nAfter the water has drained from the column, the resin bed volume should be 800 µl.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/79f959af-91a9-4307-96bb-116acb162616/cppb20102-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nSample preparation with in-house-made Plexiglas racks. Racks are fitted with cotton pellets ensure retention of the Dowex 50 (orange, top) and Dowex 1 (white, bottom) resins. Dowex 50 columns are racked on top of the Dowex 1 columns, which fit into 5-ml scintillation vials.\n32. Apply supernatant of the centrifuged sample from step 30 to the Dowex 50 column. Let sample run into the resin.",
    "Avoid disturbing the resins and do not let the columns dry out.\n33. Add 500 µl sterile ultrapure water and let it run into resin. Repeat this step every 5 min for a total of eight times to give a final elution volume of 4 ml.\nIf a different-sized column is used, the final elution volume should be five times the bed volume of the column.\nThe glucan chains will not bind to the resins and are collected in the outflow.\n34. Freeze sample in liquid nitrogen.\n35. Freeze-dry sample until completely dry (usually ∼2 days).\n36. Add 200 µl sterile ultrapure water to freeze-dried sample and dissolve well by vortexing.\n37. Transfer dissolved sample to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and briefly spin down to remove any resin remnants.\n38. Carefully transfer 100 µl supernatant to a vial suitable for autosampler of the HPAEC-PAD system. Perform HPAEC-PAD using HPAEC-PAD system with a column and the following standard program:\n         \nStarting conditions: 95% Eluent A and 5% Eluent B.\nGradient 0-13 min: linear to 60% Eluent A and 40% Eluent B.\nGradient 13-50 min: linear to 15% Eluent A and 85% Eluent B.\nRe-equilibrating 50-70 min: 95% Eluent A and 5% Eluent B.\nFor HPAEC-PAD, we use an ICS 5000 HPLC (Dionex) system equipped with an electrochemical detector and gold electrode. We recommend using a CarboPac® PA200 column (Dionex), which is designed for separation of neutral oligosaccharides. Separation is achieved at a high pH, such that the hydroxyl groups are ionized. Longer glucans bind more tightly to the column. The chains are eluted with a NaOH/sodium acetate gradient.\nWe normally inject 10 µl for analysis.\n39. Determine and sum individual peak areas. Express each peak area as a percentage of the total area of all peaks and plot values accordingly (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20102#cppb20102-fig-0004]).",
    "A maltodextrin standard can be injected to determine the different glucans present in samples. To compare two samples, subtracting one CLD from another results in a difference plot that allows easy visualization of the differences in the relative amounts of each chain length.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a1128438-907c-4833-a3b0-388a00dad238/cppb20102-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nAnalysis of the chain-length distribution (CLD) of amylopectin. (A) Model of amylopectin structure. Circles represent glucose molecules linked via α-1,4 linkages (closed circles) or α-1,6 linkages that create branchpoints (open circles). (B) Amylopectin treated with a debranching mixture containing isoamylase and pullulanase to hydrolyze the α-1,6 linkages generates linear chains. (C) Typical CLD chromatograms obtained by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) of glucans from cassava (black) and a maltodextrin standard (blue). Maltodextrin gives a mixture of glucans with an increasing degree of polymerization (DP), starting with glucose (DP1) and then proceeding to maltose (DP2), maltotriose (DP3), maltotetraose (DP4), and so on. (D) CLD calculated from the chromatograms. Peak areas of chains containing between 3 and 70 glucose units are summed, and the relative percentage of the total area is plotted against the chain length/degree of polymerization.\nDetermination of phosphate content\n40. Weigh out 5 mg purified starch (see step 12) in a 1.5-ml reaction tube and add 50 µl ultrapure water. Prepare triplicates and also a blank sample without starch.\nNote the exact weight.\n41. Add 50 µl of 2 M HCl and acid-hydrolyze for 2 hr in a 95°C water bath.\n42. Cool samples to room temperature and neutralize with ∼100 µl of 1 M NaOH.\nYou should test the pH and note the exact neutralization volume.",
    "43. Centrifuge tubes for 5 min at 10,000 × g, room temperature. Transfer 50 µl hydrolyzed supernatant into a new 1.5-ml reaction tube and add 3 µl of Antarctic phosphatase and 5.3 µl of 10× Antarctic phosphatase reaction buffer. Mix by pipetting up and down.\n44. Incubate for 2 hr in a 37°C water bath.\nDuring this step, starch is dephosphorylated.\n45. Transfer 30 µl dephosphorylated sample into a 96-well flat-bottom microtiter plate and add 20 µl ultrapure water.\n46. Prepare a calibration curve using a dilution series of 0 to 10 nmol K2HPO4 using 1 mM K2HPO4 stock solution.\n47. Using a multichannel pipet, add 125 µl Malachite Green solution to each well.\nFree phosphates will form a colored complex with molybdate and malachite green.\n48. Incubate 10 min at room temperature and read absorbance at 660 nm with a microtiter plate reader.\n49. Plot absorbance of the standards against the amount of phosphate. Determine linear range and calculate slope of the standard curve. Then, calculate phosphate content of the starch samples, taking into account dilutions made during the procedure."
