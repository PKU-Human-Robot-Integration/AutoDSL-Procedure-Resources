    "NOTE: The HEK-293T cell line continuously expressing FLAG-tagged hEAG1 channel protein is constructed by transfecting a pCDH lentiviral plasmid containing the DNA sequence of hEAG1 with a FLAG at the distal C-terminus into HEK-293T cells followed by the puromycin-resistant selection as previously described15.\n1. Affinity Purification of FLAG-tagged hEAG1 Channel Protein from HEK-293T Cells\nThaw cells stably expressing hEAG1 channels from liquid nitrogen into the warm water (37 °C) quickly. Seed the cells (about 5 x 106 frozen cells) in a 10 cm dish. Grow the cell overnight in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's (DMEM) medium supplemented with 8 mL 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 4 mM L-glutamine and changed the medium the next day.\nCheck the GFP fluorescence of these HEK-293T cells by using a fluorescent microscope to make sure the high percentage of cells stably express hEAG1 channels in the culturing system. Exponentially trypsinize the growing cells with 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin for 1 min at room temperature and thenadd 2 mL of serum-containing culture fluid to terminate the digestion. Transfer 400 μL of cell suspension to a 15 cm dish containing 15 mL of complete DMEM medium. Prepare four 15 cm dishes in total.\nHarvest these cells after 2–3 days culture when the cells reach at about 90% confluency.\nRemove the growth medium from the cells and wash them twice with 4 mL of phosphate buffered saline (1x PBS, pH = 7.4).\nDiscard PBS after washing.\nScrape the cells into 2 mL 1x PBS for each dish by using cell scrape and transfer the scraped cells with 1 mL pipette into a 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension for 5 min at 420 x g at 4 °C.\nDecant and discard the supernatant.",
    "Resuspend the cell pellet in total 4 mL of lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, pH 7.0, contained complete protease inhibitor) for 30 min on ice, and vortex thoroughly the lysate every 10 min.\nCentrifuge the cell lysate for 10 min at 12,000 x g at 4 °C.\nTransfer the supernatant to a 5 mL tube and keep it on ice for immediate use.\nPrepare the anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin.\nThoroughly suspend the resin (supplied as a 50% suspension in store buffer) by gentle inversion to make sure the bottle of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel is a uniform suspension of gel beads.\nImmediately transfer 400 μL of suspension to a chilled 1.5 mL tube.\nCentrifuge the suspension for 30 s at 8, 000 x g at 4 °C and discard the supernatant carefully to wash out the store buffer.\nAdd 500 μL 1x PBS to the resin and suspend the pellet with 1 mL pipette. Then centrifuge the suspension for 30 s at 8, 000 x g at 4 °C and discard the supernatant PBS carefully. Repeat these wash step to clear the stored buffer.\nAdd 500 μL protein extract supernatant prepared at step 1.3.8 to the resin pellet to suspend the pellet and transfer the suspension to a new chilled 5 mL tube. Repeat this step again to make sure no gel beads left. Add the left protein extract to the mixture.\nIncubate the mixture overnight on a shaker at 8 rpm at 4 °C to capture the FLAG fusion protein.\nCentrifuge the mixture after 12 h incubation for 10 min at 1, 000 x g at 4 °C.\nDiscard the supernatant and wash the pellet three times with 500 μL of 1x PBS. Keep it on ice for immediate use.",
    "Elution the FLAG hEAG1 protein with 3x FLAG peptide.\nPrepare 3X FLAG elution solution. Dissolve 3X FLAG peptide in 500 μL stock solution (0.5 M Tris-HCl, 1 M NaCl, pH = 7.5) at a concentration of 8 μg/μL.\nAdd 10 μL 3x FLAG elution solution to 390 μL of PBS to be a 200 ng/μL final concentration solution.\nAdd 400 μL of 3x FLAG elution solution to the gel beads prepared at step 1.8.\nIncubate the sample at the shaker at 8 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C.\nCentrifuge the resin for 30 s at 8, 000 x g.\nTransfer the supernatant to a fresh 1.5 mL tube and store it at 4 °C for immediate use.\n2. Concentration Assay and Confirmation of Purified FLAG Fusion hEAG1 by BCA Protein Assay Kit and Western Blotting\nDetermine the concentration of purified protein using the BCA protein assay kit according the manufacture's instruction.\nUse 30 μL sample for western analysis to confirm the interest protein had been purified by using an ANTI-FLAG antibody as previously described15.\n3. Labeling the Purified Channel Protein with Biotin for the BLI Assay\nPrepare 5 mg/mL biotin stock solution in PBS. For each test (two biosensors), add a 3-fold molar excess of biotin to 20 μg purified protein to achieve a preferable N-terminal biotinylation of the purified protein in PBS.\nIncubate the sample in the dark on ice for at least 30 min.\nPrepare the sample dilution (SD) buffer: PBS with 0.02% polysorbate 20 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, pH 7.4).",
    "Perform ultrafiltration to change the buffer of the purified channel protein to SD buffer. Remove the unbound biotin by using ultrafiltration device with molecular weight cutoff of 30 kDa, adding the SD buffer and centrifuging the sample at 12,000 x g, for 10 min at 4 °C.\nRemove the ultrafiltrate from the centrifuge tube of ultrafiltration device, add 200 μL SD buffer into the filter device and centrifuging the sample at 12,000 x g, for 10 min at 4°C. Repeat this operation at least three times.\nTo collect the buffer exchanged sample, reversed insert the filter device into a 1.5 mL tube and centrifuging them at 2,000 x g, for 5 min at 4 °C. Keep the sample on ice for immediate use.\n4. Preparation of PIP2 Solution for Assay\nPrepare the stock solution of PIP2 (1 mM) in deionized H2O by sonicating for 30 min on ice as previously described17. Store the solution in glass vials at -20 °C and dilute it to the final concentrations immediately before experiments by vigorous vortexing.\n5. BLI Assay\nTurn on the equipment and check the \"instrument status\" window to confirm the machine is at \"ready\" state to prewarm the equipment at least for 30 min before the BLI study.\nMake sure the door of the instrument is closed before opening the Data Acquisition software and choose the \"New Kinetics Experiment\" in the Experiment Wizard.\nDefine the wells to be used on the 96-well plate by right click to choose buffer, load, and sample. For sample wells, the unit of concentration of biotinylated FLAG fusion hEAG1 protein should be input as molar (10 μg, 0.09 μM).",
    "Define the assay steps including baseline, loading, association and dissociation. Choose an assay step and double click on the respective column. A duplicate of assay definition is set for control sensors. Set the rpm as 1,000. Choose 1 min for baseline step and 5–10 min for loading, association, and dissociation, respectively. Perform the test at room temperature (about 24 °C).\n\tNOTE: There are two main procedures: loading the biotinylated channel protein to the sensors and assaying the interaction with small molecule compounds. They can be proceeded continuously (baseline, loading, baseline, association and dissociation). Alternatively, they can be proceeded separately to avoid wasting the test compounds when the first loading part unsuccessful.\nClick the columns which contain the sensors and click the \"Fill\" to indicate the locations of sensors in the sensor tray.\nReview all planned steps to check for mistakes and go back to correct them.\nSet the location of data files and click \"Go\" to start the assay.\n\tNOTE: The sensors need prewetted for at least 10 min in SD buffer, if this step has been done, then the \"Delayed experiment start\" setting should be skipped. If not, set a 600 s delay before prewetting the sensors.\nPut a black 96-well plate in the bottom of the tray and insert the A1 corner of the plate into the notch on the tray to seat the plate. For the wells to load the sensors, 200 μL of assay buffer per well add into 2 wells in row A and 2 wells in row B of the 96-well plate.\nPrepare another black 96-well plate as the sample plate and fill the wells with 200 μL SD buffer in row B as control or biotinylated hEAG1 protein solution (10 μg) in row A as assigned during programming in step 5.3.",
    "NOTE: Avoid introducing bubbles.\nOpen the door of the instrument and insert the sensor tray and sample plate into the left and right plate holder, respectively. Check that the sensor tray and sample plate are positioned correctly based on the shape of left plate holder and the \"A1\" marker on the top right corner of right plate holder. Close the door and start the assay.\n6. Data Analysis\nOpen the Data Analysis software and load the folder containing the assay data. Click \"Processing\" to get into the processing menu interface and we can see the colorful raw kinetic curves.\nUnder Step1: \"Data Selection\", click \"Sensor Selection\". On the \"Sensor Tray #1\", click the sensor wells only wetted with SD buffer and right click to \"Change Sensor Type\" to \"Reference Sensor\". On the 'Sample Plate Map\", designate the all the non-specific binding wells and right click to \"Change Well Type\" to \"Reference Well\".\nTick in the box before \"Subtraction\" of Step 2 and point \"Double Reference\".\nIn Step 3: \"Align Y Axis\", select \"Baseline\" as the alignment step. For \"Time Range\", enter the last 10 s of that baseline (i.e. From: 0.1 To: 59.8).\nIn Step 4: \"Inter-step Correction\", select \"align to Baseline\" to minimize signal shifts between the association and dissociation steps.\nIn Step 5: \"Process\", select Savitzky-Golay filtering function in most cases and proceed \"Process Data\".\nSave Raw Data for further data analysis using other software in Step 7: \"Save Results\".\nClick \"Analysis | Curve Fitting\".\nFor \"Step to Analyze\", choose \"Association | Dissociation\". For \"Model\", select 1:1.",
    "NOTE: we choose 1:1 model because it fitted well on our original data and avoided the possibility of over fitting under 1:2 or 2:1 model due to their high freedom. But other options are available here and can be suitably chosen for other fitting analysis for different binding models of analyte.\nFor \"Fitting\", choose Global (Full). For \"Group By\", select \"Color\". Select \"Rmax Unlinked By Sensor\" to allow independent fitting of maximal signal response (Rmax).\nClick \"Fit Curves!\" to start the nonlinear regression analysis. Hill equation and single exponential function were used in our study.\nClick \"Data Export |Save Report\" to save fitting results. Or click \"Data Export | Export Fitting Results\" to save the raw data for further graphing and data analysis with other software.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
