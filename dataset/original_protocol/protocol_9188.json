    "1. Preparation of Rat Tail Collagen\nCollect 6-10 adult rat tails (it is possible to store the tails at -20 °C until use).\nSoak the tails in 95% ethanol overnight at room temperature (RT).\nDissection of rat tails (in tissue culture hood):\n(keep tools in 70% ethanol when not using them and make sure that all solutions, tools and glassware used throughout this procedure are sterile) \nTo collect tendons from the tails, cut off the tip of the tail. Hold large end of the tail with a pair of forceps. Use another pair of forceps to hold, bend and break the tail close to the other forceps. Pull apart and the tendons will be left behind (Figure 1A,B).\nCollect the tendons in sterile H2O and after collecting all tendons move them to a new petridish with sterile H2O.\nTake 2-3 tendons and shred them using 2 pairs of forceps in a new petridish with sterile H2O. Remove non-tendon tissue such as veins (tendon tissue is shiny and reflective; Figure 1C). After removal of all non-tendon tissue, each tail yields approximately 100-150 mg of tendons.\nTransfer the tendons to 300 ml of sterile 3% acetic acid and stir slowly overnight at 4 °C.\nAdd an additional 200 ml of sterile 3% acetic acid and stir slowly overnight at 4 °C.\nCentrifuge the acetic acid solution containing the tendons at ~2700 xg for 120 min at 4 °C to pellet non-dissolved tendons and non-tendon tissue.\nDuring centrifugation prepare dialysis tubing:\n \ncut pieces of 40 cm\nboil in 500 μM EDTA for 5 min\ncool in sterile H2O",
    "Tie a knot at one end of the dialysis tubing and fill the tubing with the supernatant of the centrifuged tendon solution on ice in the tissue culture hood using an automatic pipette and a 25 ml pipette. Avoid producing bubbles. Knot the other end of the tubing and store tubing on sterile aluminum foil on ice until all pieces of tubing are filled (Figure 1D).\nPrepare 10 l of sterile 0.1X MEM, pH 4.0, in the tissue culture hood. Add floater to pieces of tubing and add these to the pre-cooled 0.1X MEM solution in a 10 l beaker. Dialyze overnight at 4 °C while slowly stirring. This dialysis removes excess acid while keeping the pH low.\nReplace with new pre-cooled 10 l 0.1X MEM and stir overnight at 4 °C.\nRepeat the previous step by replacing with new pre-cooled 10 l 0.1X MEM and stir overnight at 4 °C.\nAliquot collagen solution into sterile 50 ml tubes. Store aliquots at 4 °C. Keep 6-12 months, only handle the collagen stock in the tissue culture hood.\nIt is important to test whether the purified collagen needs to be diluted (in 0.1x MEM) to obtain optimal results in the collagen matrix assay. Therefore, generate a collagen dilution series (undiluted collagen, 1:1, 1:2 and 1:5 diluted) and perform collagen matrix assays as described below to determine the optimal collagen dilution.\n2. Dissection of the Dopaminergic Midbrain7,8\nDissect E14.5 mouse embryos from the uterus of the mother and keep in L15 medium on ice until needed.\nAll subsequent dissection steps are performed in L15 medium on ice.\nDissect out the brain.\nRemove the telencephalon by cutting along the medial part of each telencephalic vesicle (use the telencephalic vesicles for striatal explants).\nRemove the meningeal sheath.",
    "Make a dorsoventral cut just rostral of the mesencephalic flexure.\nMake another dorsoventral cut just caudal of the mesencephalic flexure.\nMake a rostrocaudal cut along the dorsal midline using a microdissection knife to expose the underlying ventral midbrain tissue. Be careful not to hit the ventral midbrain tissue as it contains the dopaminergic neurons (Figure 2).\nMake two rostrocaudal cuts lateral and parallel to the ventral midline to remove dorsal midbrain tissue.\nDivide the remaining ventral midbrain tissue into explants using a microdissection knife.\nStore the explants in L15 medium containing 5% FBS on ice until use.\n3. Dissection of the Striatum\nAll dissection steps are performed in L15 medium on ice.\nUse telencephalic vesicles dissected during midbrain dissection.\nRemove the thalamus by cutting in between the thalamus and the striatum using forceps.\nMake a mediolateral cut rostral to the striatum to remove rostral structures such as the olfactory bulb. Repeat this step for tissue located caudally to the striatum.\nPosition the remaining slice to obtain a coronal view of the striatum (Figure 2).\nThe striatum can be recognized as a slightly less dense (more transparent) part of tissue. Dissect out the striatum and cut into explants using a microdissection knife. Avoid the slightly darker tissue close to the midline, which contains migrating neurons of the lateral and medial ganglionic eminence.\nStore the explants in L15 medium containing 5% FBS on ice until use.\n4. Assembly Collagen Matrix Assays\nPreparation of the collagen (all steps on ice, use cooled pipette tips)\nMix 860 μl of diluted collagen with 100 μl of 10x MEM and 40 μl of 1M sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and keep on ice. If at this point the collagen warms up it will solidify.",
    "Add a drop of 20 μl (approximately 5 mm in diameter) of prepared collagen to a coverslip in a well of a 4-well Nunc dish and let it stand in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C and 5%CO2 for 30 min (ambient O2 concentration is sufficient). During this incubation the collagen will gelatinize.\nSetup co-culture in collagen gel\nAfter the collagen has gelatinized, use a pipette with a 200 μl tip to transfer a dopaminergic or striatal explant to the collagen.\nMove the explants in close proximity to each other using a needle. Keep them apart at a distance of approximately the diameter of one explant (~200-300 μm) (Figure 2).\nRemove excess medium and add 20 μl of prepared collagen on top of the explants. This will often cause the explants to move around. Reposition the explants using a needle as described in 4.4.\nLet the collagen solidify for 15 min at RT followed by 30 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nAfter the collagen has set, add 400 μl of explant medium and grow for 2-3 days in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n5. Analysis by Immunohistochemistry and Quantification\nImmunohistochemistry\nTo fix explants, gently add 400 μl of 8% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS to 400 μl of medium (thereby diluting the PFA to 4%) and let stand for 1 hour at RT.\nWash 3x 15 min in PBS at RT.\nIncubate in blocking buffer (BB; PBS + 1% FBS + 0.1% Triton X-100) for 2 hours.\nIncubate overnight with primary antibody in BB at 4 °C. For dopaminergic axons use anti-tyrosine hydroxylase antibodies (1:1000)7, for striatal axons anti-DARPP32 antibodies (1:500)9 and for visualizing all axons anti-βIII tubulin (1:3000)7.\nWash 5x 1 hour in PBS at RT.",
    "Incubate with secondary antibody conjugated to the appropriate fluorophore (1:500) in BB overnight at 4 °C. From this step on minimize exposure of the explants to light (e.g. cover them with aluminum foil).\nWash overnight in PBS at 4 °C followed by several washes during the next day.\nMount explants on microscope slides using Prolong Antifade reagent mounting medium. Add a drop of ~10 μl on a glass microscope slide. Take the coverslip and gently place it on the drop of mounting medium with the explant side facing down. Avoid trapping any air under de coverslip by very gently lowering it on the drop of mounting medium.\nQuantification by calculating P/D ratio\nAcquire digital images of the explants using an epifluorescence microscope (Figure 3).\nUsing these images, divide each explant into quadrants to generate a proximal quadrant (i.e. part of the explant closest to the adjacent explant) and a distal quadrant (part of the explant farthest away from the adjacent explant) (Figure 2, 4).\nMeasure the length of 20 longest neurites emerging from the explant both in the proximal and distal quadrants.\nUse the average length of the 20 longest neurites to calculate the P/D ratio for each individual explant. A P/D ratio > 1 indicates axon attraction, while a ratio < 1 indicates axon repulsion.\nIn some cases, the dense growth of neurites prevents the assessment of individual neurite length. In these situations, quantification can be performed by measuring the distance between the edge of the explant and the leading front of axon growth in the proximal and distal quadrants.\n6. Representative Images",
    "After successful culture of dopaminergic and striatal explants a large number of axons are visible using bright field microscopy or as visualized by anti-βIII tubulin immunocytochemistry (not shown). A subset of these axons will be dopaminergic or striatal axons as visualized using immunocytochemistry (Figure 3). By dividing the explants into quadrants as described and determining P/D ratios, a putative axon attractive or repulsive effect can be quantified (Figure 3E).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3691/3691fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.  Photos illustrating the preparation of collagen from rat tail tendons. A) Pulling apart the rat tail exposes the tendons. B) Tendons are visible as rope-like bundles. C) The tendons are easy to distinguish from veins by their shiny white appearance. D) After dissolving the tendons in acetic acid, the solution is transferred to dialysis tubing. To keep the dissolved collagen cold, tubes are placed on sterile aluminum foil on ice.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3691/3691fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.  Schematic indicating the different steps of the procedure. Appropriate brain regions are dissected and cut to generate explants. A single midbrain and striatal explant are positioned in close proximity in a collagen matrix and left to grow for 48-72 hours at 37 °C. Axons are visualized by fluorescence immunohistochemistry and a P/D ratio is calculated to quantify chemotropic responses.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3691/3691fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.
