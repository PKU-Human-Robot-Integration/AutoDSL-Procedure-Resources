    "The study was approved by the Research Ethics Board of the University Health Network. Signed informed consent was obtained from each participant before enrollment in the study. Signed informed consent was also obtained from any caregivers or household members appearing in video recordings.\n1. Verification of the protocol applicability to the individual\nNOTE: This protocol is intended to be applied to individuals with impaired but not completely absent hand function (specific criteria can be adapted to the population and/or question of interest).\nAsk participants whether their affected hands impact their ability to carry out ADLs.\n\tNOTE: It is recommended to ask participants to give some examples of tasks that they can and cannot perform independently with their affected hands.\nVerify that the total score on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is above 21, in order to avoid potential difficulties understanding and following protocol procedures.\n2. Determination of the daily routine of participants\nAsk participants to recall their daily routines over the past two weeks. Document which daily tasks are performed, for how long, and at approximately what time.\nIn collaboration with participants, select 3 timeslots of 1.5 h each during which to record videos. Select timeslots that are spread over different days of the week, and take place when ADLs involving the hands are typically carried out in sequence.\n\tNOTE: The selected ADLs must be representative of each participant's typical activities, and be perceived by them as meaningful. Scheduling recording periods on different days is intended to increase the variety of recorded ADLs and to promote the capture of useful and meaningful data.\n\t​NOTE: Recording timeslots are scheduled for recording efficiency, but participants should understand that they have full control of when to start and to stop recordings.\n3. Agreement on recording schedules and target video content with participants",
    "Obtain agreement of each participant on the recording schedules, after discussing any concerns that they may have.\nSet a goal of 3 h of videos over two weeks. Inform participants that insufficient videos may lead to extending their recording periods.\n4. Emphasis of the importance of performing ADLs naturally\nInstruct participants to focus on capturing realistic routines, instead of specifying particular activities to record. The intent of the instruction is to discourage participants from artificially recording specific activities in greater amounts than is typical for them.\n5. Notification of potential privacy issues during recordings at home\nEnsure that participants understand that all recordings should take place inside their homes, not in public places to avoid privacy issues.\nGive some examples that may raise privacy concerns, such as bathing, dressing/undressing, and checking confidential information. Remind participants to be aware of mirrors, which may show their faces in the recordings.\nSuggest that participants avoid the presence of other people such as family members or caregivers as much as possible in the videos.\n\t​NOTE: In the context of research studies, in cases where the presence of other people is unavoidable, informed consent should be obtained from those individuals.\n6. Camera and tablet instruction\nNOTE: If participants indicate during the initial contact that they require caregiver assistance for many of their daily needs, the caregiver is encouraged to also attend the study visit and be trained on the use of the equipment, so that they can later assist the participant.\nDemonstrate how to use an egocentric camera (Table of Materials) to participants.\n\t\nDemonstrate how to turn the camera on and off.\nDemonstrate how to control recordings (start, pause, stop) using the camera.\nDemonstrate how to use a tablet (Table of Materials) with the preinstalled camera app to control the recordings, if applicable.",
    "​NOTE: The demonstration includes controlling the recordings from the camera app, as well as replaying and editing (e.g., trim or delete) the recorded videos. A camera remote was initially considered (Supplemental Files), but in practice was not used because participants were comfortable using the camera or tablet to start and stop recordings.\n\t\nDemonstrate how to turn on and off the tablet.\nDemonstrate how to connect the tablet to the camera through the camera app.\nDemonstrate how to control the recordings from the camera app.\nDemonstrate how to review recorded videos from the camera app.\nDemonstrate how to trim or delete the videos from the camera app.\nDemonstrate how to don and doff the camera using an elastic headband adjustable to the participant's head.\n\tNOTE: See Figure 1.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61898/61898fig01.jpg\nFigure 1.

Adjust the headband to wear the camera comfortably and steadily.\nEnsure an optimal angle of the camera with respect to the forehead.\nAsk participants to record a short segment of video while moving the hands in front of them and manipulating an object (e.g., the tablet).\nReview the recorded video and ensure the two hands were clearly visible in the central region of the scene while conducting manipulation tasks.\nPractice the use of the camera and tablet with participants and their caregivers, until they demonstrate proficiency.\n7. Giving the equipment",
    "Give the kit with all the equipment to participants to record their ADLs at home. In addition to the camera and tablet, the kit includes extra camera batteries, battery chargers for both camera and tablet, charging cables, headband for the camera, and a printed set of guidelines for using the camera (See the Supplemental Material).\n8. Experimental troubleshooting and followup\nProvide contact information of the researchers to help solve obstacles during the actual recordings at home. After one week, researchers call the participants to document the recording progress and solve any potential technical issues.\n9. Retrieval of equipment and videos\nRetreive all the equipment and videos from participants in person or through pre-paid mail parcels.\nEnsure that participants agree to share all the videos returned. Participants are encouraged to review all of the collected videos before returning them to the research team, and to delete any portions that they do not wish to share.\nFor research studies, review the returned videos and check if anyone appears in the video without having given their consent. If so, send consent forms or call the individuals who appear in the videos to gain their consents for use of the videos. If the individuals are not reachable, the portions of the videos in which they appear are deleted by the researchers.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
