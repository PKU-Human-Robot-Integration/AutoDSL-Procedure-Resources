    "1. Preparation of Sodium Naphthalenide Activating Solution and Surface Activation\nNote: Carry out reactions in a well-ventilated fume hood. Follow general rules for handling highly flammable solvents and corrosive metals like metallic sodium. Naphthalene has a very unpleasant smell (mothball), even in very small amounts! If not indicated otherwise reactions are performed at room temperature. Sodium azide is highly toxic! THF (99.9%, see List of Materials) was stored over approximately 20% (by volume) molecular sieve. Distill THF with a noticeable water content over sodium. The formation of sodium naphthalenide does not occur if trace amounts of water are present.\nTo a solution of 1.4 g (10.9 mmol) of naphthalene in 20 ml tetrahydrofuran (THF, dried over 3 Å molecular sieve), add 0.25 g (10.9 mmol) sodium metal in a screw-capped 100 ml glass bottle equipped with a PTFE-coated magnetic stirring bar.\n\tNote: Dissolution can be greatly enhanced by cutting the sodium into small pieces and modest heating (35 - 40 °C). The final solution has a dark, slightly greenish color and may be stored under strictly dry conditions.\nPunch out PTFE discs of 12 mm diameter from 0.5 mm thick foil material. Mark one side (e.g., using a letter stamp punch) and clean with iso-propanol.\nIncubate PTFE-samples individually in the activating solution (step 1.1) for 1 - 2 min using forceps. Note: The color change from white to dark brown indicates successful treatment.\nSubsequently rinse twice with THF and then with iso-propanol.\n\tNote: The naphthalenide solution is exhausted when its color changes to a watery light brown. Unused naphthalenide solution (possibly containing metallic sodium) has to be decomposed by slowly adding iso-propanol prior to disposal.",
    "Oxidize treated samples in hydrogen peroxide (30%) containing 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid for 3 hr. Wash with water and dry. The surface now has a slight brownish appearance. Note: Activation and oxidation result in a drastically increased wettability of the surface. This finding was examined in detail previously 14.\nTreat oxidized discs with 50% (v/v) hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDI) in dry THF for 2 hr, rinse with THF and leave to dry.\nHydrolyze isocyanate bearing samples in water for 2 - 3 hr and dry. Note: The final amino-functionalized PTFE surface is far more stable than the isocyanate-bearing samples and is compatible with many standard crosslinkers for further coupling.\n2. Peptide Immobilization\nPrepare a solution of 20% (v/v) diethyleneglycol diglycidyl ether (diepoxide) in 50 mM carbonate buffer, pH 9.\nPlace the aminated discs with the marked side up individually into a 24 well plate and add 1.5 ml of the epoxide solution. Ensure full coverage of the samples. Incubate for 2 hr and wash two times with water and once with carbonate buffer.\nAdd 50 µl of a 0.5 mg/ml peptide (e.g., REDV) in 50 mM carbonate buffer, pH 9 containing 0.01% NaN3, to the bottom of individual wells of a fresh 24 well plate and carefully place the epoxy-functionalized discs upside-down (i.e., marked side down) onto the drop of the peptide solution. Make sure that the space between the bottom of the well and the PTFE disc is completely wetted due to capillary action.\nIncubate in a wet chamber (e.g., any sealable plastic box with a tight closing lid) with humidified atmosphere (by placing wet tissue paper on the bottom) for at least 3 hr or overnight.",
    "Note: Albeit the REDV motif may be regarded as well-characterized, a scrambled or reverse amino acid sequence may be included as an additional negative control.\nWash three times with water and sterilize in 50% iso-propanol/water for at least 30 min. Prior to cell seeding, rinse the samples in sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\n3. Cell Seeding\nGrow HUVECs using standard cell culture procedures 17,18.\nPlace the peptide-conjugated samples with the modified side up in a 24 well plates. Use untreated PTFE discs as a control.\nSeed 5 x 104 HUVECs in 2 ml medium per well and incubate for 4 hr at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in an incubator.\nRemove the discs, rinse carefully to remove unattached cells and transfer to a fresh 24 well plate. Add 2 ml of fresh medium and incubate for the desired period (e.g., 24 hr, 1 w, etc.). Change medium every two days.\nPrepare a stock solution of 1 mg/ml Calcein-AM in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).\nAfter growing the cells remove the medium, wash with PBS and add PBS containing 1 µl/ml Calcein-AM stain (e.g., 1 µl of a stock solution per ml PBS). Gently agitate and incubate at 37 °C for 45 min in the dark.\nWash with PBS and immediately take micrographs on a fluorescence microscope equipped with standard FITC filters (Ex 488 nm, Em 515 nm). Use 100-fold magnification. Perform triplicates from unmodified as well as treated samples.\nUsing ImageJ software determine the area colonized by the cells. Alternatively count the cells manually or use ImageJ. Both methods will give similar information about the attachment and growth of cells on the respective surfaces.\nSubscription Required.
