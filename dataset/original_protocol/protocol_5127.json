    "gRNA design for specific gene/site of interestFor knocking out a gene of interest, choose gRNAs located in the exons. For editing the non CDS region in the genome, choose a region where disruption would have this desired effect. We strongly recommend using CRISPR-P (cbi.hzau.edu.cn[href=http://cbi.hzau.edu.cn/crispr/]) to design gRNAs (Lei et al., 2014). It provides a specificity score for each possible gRNA and lists the potential off-targets. Additionally, it provides a list of useful restriction enzymes that would recognize the gRNA spacer for RFLP analysis of this specific site. Construct gRNA plasmidTo drive gRNA expression in plants, we constructed a gRNA plasmid targeting NbPDS. Any other genes-of-interest can also be targeted. To clone the gRNA easily, we first used a small vector (T-U6p-scaffold-U6t). Then, the promoter-gRNA-terminator construct is transferred to a larger binary vector, such as pCAMBIA2300 and pCVA.Perform inverse PCR (Stemmer and Morris, 1992) to add gRNA spacer between the AtU6 promoter and gRNA scaffold necessary for Cas9 binding (Figure 1). Setup reactions as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170327/20170327181440_3754.jpgimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170327/20170327033153_5070.jpgFigure 1. Illustration of pT-U6p-scaffold-U6t (Yin et al., 2015) and the use of inverse PCR for inserting gRNA spacer into pT-U6p-scaffold-U6t to generate pT-U6p-gRNA-scaffold-U6t. A. AtU6 promoter, scaffold, and AtU6 terminator are shown in orange boxes on the plasmid map. Two primers used for inserting gRNA spacer (targeting NbPDS) are indicated on the plasmid map with their respective directions. Parallel blacklines on the primers are complementary sequences. SacI and PstI are used to cut the gRNA expression cassette which is then cloned into a binary vector. The small arrow here is to indicate scaffold. B. Sequence information for inverse PCR. Here, gRNA spacer targeting NbPDS is used as an example. Partial sequence of the NbPDS locus is shown in black. PAM and MlyI site are shown. gRNA spacer is also shown in black above the NbPDS locus.",
    "Two primers (oYK1056 and oYK1057) for PCR are shown, the sequence from AtU6 is shown in red, and the sequence from scaffold is shown in blue. The two primers that bind to the template (vector) during the PCR process are also shown with primers and vector indicated. The change after inverse PCR is shown below the arrow.Perform PCR amplification using the following parameters (Tm represents the annealing temperature of the primer pair):imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170327/20170327181553_0438.jpgSetup a restriction enzyme digest to remove the plasmid template in the above PCR product as follows: Note: DpnI is a methylation sensitive enzyme, and plasmid purified from E. coli DH5α is generally methylated. Thus, DpnI is often used to remove plasmid template. Here, a ligation or a denaturation/reannealing step is not necessary to connect the ends of the vector, because the PCR product with overlapping ends will re-circularize to form a doubly-nicked plasmid  and will be repaired further in bacteria to form an intact plasmid.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170327/20170327181714_2299.jpgMix well and incubate at 37 °C for 2 h.Transform E.coli DH5α using 1-2 μl product of the above reaction with heat shock at 42 °C for 90 sec, recover at 37 °C for 1 h, plate on LB plate with 100 mg/L ampicillin, and then incubate overnight at 37 °C (Im, 2011).Select one to five transformants and culture overnight in LB with 100 mg/L ampicillin at 37 °C, 220 rpm. Extract plasmids from the transformants respectively with TIANprep Mini Plasmid Kit, and Sanger sequence the plasmid pT-U6p-gRNA:NbPDS-scaffold-U6t with sequencing primer M13-47 to confirm the presence of the gRNA spacer.Check Cas9 activity and gRNA efficiency using fsGUS (frameshift GUS) reporter systemIt’s necessary to confirm if KQ334 plants retain Cas9 activity and that Cas9 cleaves DNA under the guidance of gRNA.",
    "In this system, a 23 bp sequence with a PAM (AGG) at the end is inserted downstream of the start codon of the GUS gene, which causes a frame shift of the GUS gene (fsGUS). We co-expressed two vectors: one harboring the fsGUS gene driven by a 35S promoter termed pJG081-fsGUS and the other p2300-gRNA:fsGUS containing an Arabidopsis U6-26 gene promoter (AtU6 promoter)-driven gRNA containing a 20 bp sequence that matches the first 20 bp of the sequence inserted into the fsGUS gene.There is another highly efficient method to check gRNA efficiency based on protoplast transfection. Please refer to Li and co-workers’ protocol (Li et al., 2015)  Setup a PCR reaction to amplify an fsGUS fragment in which a short sequence containing the gRNA spacer sequence and a MlyI recognition site is inserted after the GUS start codon (Figure 2). Primers used at this step should be designed specifically to flank the cut sites of different gRNAs. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170327/20170327181742_7651.jpgimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170327/20170327034140_9999.jpgFigure 2. Illustration of the fsGUS reporter system used to check gRNA efficiency. Illustration of the fsGUS reporter system. A 23 bp sequence containing a MlyI site is inserted after the start codon of the GUS gene, and the resulting sequence is designated as fsGUS. Due to the inserted sequence, fsGUS cannot be translated into a functional enzyme. fsGUS is driven by a CaMV35S promoter and placed in a binary vector. Another binary vector contains AtU6 promoter-driven gRNA that targets the first 20 bp of the inserted sequence in fsGUS. Two A. tumefaciens lines transformed with each binary vector are mixed together and infiltrated into KQ334 plant leaves. After two T-DNAs enter into the same cell, the first 20 bp of the inserted sequence in fsGUS is targeted by the Cas9/gRNA complex for cleavage.",
    "Repair via NHEJ will create in-dels at the cleavage site and, in some cases, recover the normal coding frame for fsGUS, thus creating a functional GUS which can be detected by GUS staining. (This figure is adapted and modified from Yin et al., 2015.)Perform PCR amplification using the following parameters (Tm represents the annealing temperature of the primer pair):imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170327/20170327181820_7915.jpgPurify the PCR product using PEG/MgCl2 method (Paithankar and Prasad, 1991)Add 50 μl water to 50 μl PCR product and then add 50 μl 30% PEG8000/30 mM MgCl2. Mix well and centrifuge immediately at 12,000 x g for 15 min.Next, remove the supernatant and add 200 μl 70% ethanol. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 5 min and remove the supernatant. Finally, dry the pellet and dissolve the pellet in 10 μl sterile deionized water.Construct pJG081-fsGUS using LIC method. Note: LIC is a fast, simple, and very cheap cloning technique. It utilizes annealing of complementary overhangs of a vector and a PCR fragment consisting of 9-15 bases.  Single-stranded overhangs are generated by using T4 DNA polymerase and the addition of only one dNTP in the reaction buffer, leading to an equilibrium of activity of polymerase and exonuclease at the first appearance of this nucleotide (Aslanidis and de Jong, 1990). For the generation of the single stranded tails, the purified DNA preparations are treated with T4 DNA polymerase. Setup T4 DNA polymerase treatment for the above PCR product:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170327/20170327181847_3611.jpgMix gently and well by pipetting. Incubate at 37 °C for 20 min then at 75 °C for 20 min to inactivate T4 DNA polymerase using a PCR cycler. The resulting product is designated as fsGUS-LIC.Digest pJG081 for LIC reaction:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170327/20170327181920_1000.jpgIncubate at 37 °C in incubator for 3 h.",
    "Then, purify the product using phenol/chloroform method: add an equal volume of phenol/chloroform (1:1) and vortex vigorously for 20 sec; then centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10 min at room temperature; retain the supernatant and add an equal volume of chloroform, vortex vigorously for 20 sec, and centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10 min at room temperature; precipitate the DNA from the aqueous phase of the above extractions by adding 1/10 volume of 3 M NaAc and 2 volume of ethanol.Finally, pellet the DNA by centrifugation, and dissolve it with sterile deionized water.Setup T4 DNA polymerase treatment for this linear pJG081:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170327/20170327182944_5200.jpgThe resulting product is designated as pJG081-LIC.Construct pJG081-fsGUS:Mix 5 μl fsGUS-LIC and 5 μl pJG081-LIC well, incubate at 70 °C for 10 min and then at 22 °C for 10 min. Next, transform this product into E. coli DH5α, which is then selected on medium with kanamycin.Construct p2300-gRNA:fsGUS.Setup a restriction enzyme reaction as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170327/20170327182115_2057.jpgIncubate at 37 °C for 3 h. Then, purify the product with the DNA Purification Kit according to manufacturer recommendations. To clone a complete gRNA expression cassette into pCambia 2300, U6p-gRNA:NbPDS-scaffold-U6t is cut from pT-U6p-gRNA:NbPDS-scaffold-U6t. Setup a restriction enzyme reaction as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170327/20170327182211_7926.jpgIncubate at 37 °C for 3 h. Then purify the product with the DNA Purification Kit according to manufacturer recommendations. Setup a ligation reaction as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170327/20170327182307_5390.jpgIncubate at 16 °C for 8 h and transform it into E. coli DH5α, which is then selected on medium with kanamycin.Agrobacterium transformationTransform pKQ334, pJG081-fsGUS and p2300-gRNA:fsGUS respectively into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 by heat shock method (Höfgen and Willmitzer, 1988). Select the transformants on LB medium with 50 mg L-1 kanamycin and 50 mg L-1 rifampicin at 28 °C for two days.",
    "Transient expressionNote: Either Cas9 transgenic plants (KQ334 plants) or another Agrobacterium culture containing pKQ334 plasmid (constitutive expression of Cas9) can be used for this experiment.  The Agrobacterium cultures are inoculated in a 5 ml Luria-Bertani medium containing appropriate antibiotics (50 mg L-1 rifampicin, and 50 mg L-1 kanamycin) and grown overnight in a 28 °C shaker. Agrobacterium cells are harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 x g for 5 min and resuspended in infiltration buffer, adjusted to an optical density at 600 nm of 1.0 and incubated at room temperature for 3 to 4 h before infiltration. For transient expression, equal amounts of Agrobacterium strain GV3101 cultures containing either pKQ334 or pJG081-fsGUS or p2300-gRNA:fsGUS are mixed as experimental group and spot-infiltrated into leaves of six-leaf stage plants using a 1-ml syringe. As control, Agrobacterium cultures containing either pJG081-fsGUS or p2300-gRNA:fsGUS are spot-infiltrated separately into leaves of six-leaf stage plants using a 1-ml syringe. The first three leaves counting from the top of each plant are infiltrated; each leaf is spot-infiltrated with experimental group and control group. Midrib and main veins are avoided when infiltrating. Press the nozzle of a 1 ml syringe without needle against the abaxial surface of the leaf, and hold a gloved finger on the other side and inject slowly. The infiltration area is often seen as ‘wet’ (Video 1). <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Transient expression using agro-infiltration in N. benthamiana Alternatively, equal amounts of Agrobacterium cultures containing either pJG081-fsGUS or p2300-gRNA:fsGUS can be mixed together and infiltrated into leaves of six-leaf stage KQ334 plants using a 1-ml syringe (Figure 2). As control, Agrobacterium cultures containing either pJG081-fsGUS or p2300-gRNA:fsGUS are infiltrated separately into leaves of six-leaf stage KQ334 plants using a 1-ml syringe.GUS stainingThe GUS staining assay is based on Kabbage et al.",
    "(2011) and performed as follows:Two to three days after infiltration, infiltrated leaves are collected. Vacuum infiltrate the X-gluc substrate into the collected leaves. A glass/plastic beaker is used to put leaves in for vacuum infiltration and a vacuum level of 600 mm Hg is applied (for 3 min) and released for several times until the leaves become translucent. After infiltration, leaves are incubated in darkness at room temperature overnight. Rinse the leaves by changing the solution with deionized water and remove the chlorophyll by immersing the leaves in 70% ethanol for at least one day. Construct pCVA-gRNA and pCVA-scaffoldTo perform VIGE of the target gene, pCVA-gRNA is first generated by inserting a cassette containing an AtU6 promoter and gRNA::NbPDS into pCVA. The construct pCVA-scaffold is taken as a negative control.Setup PCR reactions as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170327/20170327182355_9620.jpgPerform PCR amplification using the following parameters (Tm represents the annealing temperature of the primer pair):imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170327/20170327182426_5719.jpgThen purify the product with the DNA Purification Kit according to manufacturer recommendations.Setup a restriction enzyme reaction as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170327/20170327182454_6588.jpgIncubate at 37 °C for 3 h.

Agro-infiltration into petiole of N. benthamiana Detection of VIGE mediated mutations in plant genomic DNAFor the detection of VIGE results, genomic DNA extracted from systemic leaves according to the manufacturer’s instructions is used as template for PCR amplification (see below) of a targeted locus with primers (PDS_MlyIF and PDS_MlyIR) flanking the target site using EasyTaq DNA polymerase. PCR product is purified and digested with selected restriction enzyme (i.e.",
    ", MlyI for NbPDS) and run on a 2% agarose gel. Mutation rate is estimated by comparing band intensities using ImageJ (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij[href=https://imagej.nih.gov/ij]). The uncut band is then cut from the gel and the DNA is recovered by using DNA Purification Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The undigested purified DNA is subsequently cloned into pMD18-T vector (TAKARA) and transformed into E. coli DH5α. Clones are sequenced with M13-47 primer to check for mutations (Figure 3). An example of VIGE for NbPDS gene is shown in Figure 4, in which the PCR product of a specific primer pair targeting the NbPDS gene is digested with MlyI. PCR amplification is performed using the following parameters (Tm represents the annealing temperature of the primer pair):imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170327/20170327182628_7269.jpgimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170329/20170329012949_0993.jpgFigure 4.
