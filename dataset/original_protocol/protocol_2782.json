    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPlate organoids\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThis step involves plating organoids in a white, opaque-walled, clear-bottomed 96-well tissue culture plate to measure organoid viability and growth. For this protocol, cryopreserved organoid fragments derived from gastric tumors of Gp130Y757F mice were used.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]\nAt time of passaging, manually count the number of organoids in each well of a 24-well tissue culture plate under a bright field microscope and record the total number of organoids observed.\nAspirate and discard Organoid Growth Media.\nAdd 1 mL of 4°C cold Gentle Cell Dissociation Reagent (STEMCELL Technologies) to each dome.\nUsing a 1,000 μL pipette tip, mechanically disrupt each organoid Basement Membrane Matrix dome by gently pipetting Gentle Cell Dissociation Reagent onto each dome 10 times to break the organoids into smaller fragments.\nCritical: After disrupting each organoid Basement Membrane Matrix dome, pool the suspension into a 15 mL conical tube.\nRinse each well with 1 mL of 4°C cold Gentle Cell Dissociation Reagent and add this to the same 15 mL conical tube.\nPlace tube on an orbital roller at room temperature (approximately 20°C–25°C) for 10 min.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g at 4°C for 5 min using a swinging bucket rotor centrifuge to maximize recovery of the organoid pellet.\nCarefully aspirate and discard the supernatant without disturbing the organoid pellet.\nResuspend the organoid pellet in 5 mL of cold Wash Media.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g at 4°C for 5 min.\nCarefully aspirate and discard the supernatant without disrupting the organoid pellet.\nResuspend the organoid pellet in 1 mL of cold Wash Media.\nTransfer the resuspended organoid pellet into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge at 9,600 × g at 4°C for 5 min using a benchtop mini/micro fixed angle rotor centrifuge to maximize recovery of the organoid pellet.",
    "Note: The organoids used in this protocol can survive high centrifugal forces. Users may need to optimize centrifugal forces to accommodate their selected organoids.\nCarefully aspirate and discard the supernatant without disrupting the organoid pellet.\nGently resuspend the pellet in ice cold Basement Membrane Matrix.\nThe volume required depends on the number of experimental conditions. At least three biological replicates (each containing technical triplicates) for each condition should be used.\nAn example for calculating the amount of Basement Membrane Matrix required for a single assay plate (i.e., treatment of one biological replicate with a single compound at 6 different concentrations) is shown below:\n  N u m b e r  o f  w e l l s  f o r  a  s i n g l e  a s s a y  p l a t e =  (  6  c o n c e n t r a t i o n s  o f  a  t e s t  c o m p o u n d × 3  t e c h n i c a l  r e p l i c a t e s  f o r  e a c h  c o n c e n t r a t i o n  )  + 3  b l a n k  w e l l s + 3  c o n t r o l  w e l l s + 10  e x t r a  w e l l s = 34  w e l l s",

We recommend that a minimum of 30 and a maximum of 40 organoids are plated per well. However, users may wish to optimize this density depending on the growth kinetics of their selected organoids to ensure robust growth.\nNote: To ensure even distribution of organoids throughout the Basement Membrane Matrix mix, gently resuspend organoids by pipetting the mix after plating 5 wells.\nCritical: Do not introduce bubbles into the Basement Membrane Matrix mix when resuspending and plating organoids, as this will interfere with downstream imaging.\nCritical: Always maintain microcentrifuge tubes containing organoids resuspended in Basement Membrane Matrix on ice to prevent solidification.\nKeep the white, opaque-walled, clear-bottomed 96-well tissue culture plate on ice in a Class II biological safety cabinet.\nNote: Ensure the plate is level so that the organoid Basement Membrane Matrix mix will evenly coat the base of each well.\nDispense 35 μL of the organoid Basement Membrane Matrix mix directly into the center of each well.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2480_3.csv",
    "Each condition contains technical triplicates (i.e., three separate wells) with a gap between each well containing organoids to reduce interference of luminescence. B: Blank (wells containing only Basement Membrane Matrix and Organoid Growth Media (i.e., no organoids)). C: Control (untreated organoids). E#: Experimental Condition (organoids to be treated with a particular compound(s)).\nNote: To reduce interference of luminescence between wells on the 96-well plate, leave a gap between each well containing organoids when plating (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nCritical: Users should include three blank wells that only contain Basement Membrane Matrix and Organoid Growth Media (i.e., no organoids) to assess background levels of luminescence produced by their selected Basement Membrane Matrix and Organoid Growth Media.\nPlace the white, opaque-walled, clear-bottomed 96-well tissue culture plate into a 37°C incubator with 10% CO2 for 15 min to solidify the organoid Basement Membrane Matrix.\nPrepare and add Assay Media\nTiming: 30 min\nThis step involves preparation of the Assay Media to measure organoid viability.\nDuring the 15 min incubation period, prepare Assay Media.\nEquilibrate the RealTime-Glo™ MT Cell Viability Assay reagents NanoLuc® Enzyme (1000×) and MT Cell Viability Substrate (1000×) to 37°C by placing in an incubator for approximately 10 min or until thawed.\nOnce thawed, prepare the Assay Media by adding the 1000× enzyme and 1000× substrate to Organoid Growth Media so the final concentration of each is 1×.\n100 μL of Assay Media is required for each well.\nCritical: Prepare the Assay Media away from direct light to reduce degradation of the RealTime-Glo™ MT Cell Viability Substrate.\nAfter the 15 min incubation period, add 100 μL of Assay Media to each well in a Class II biological safety cabinet.\nReturn the plated organoids to a 37°C, 10% CO2 incubator for at least 16 h. 24 h is preferable to allow organoids to establish.",
    "Measure luminescence (organoid viability)\nTiming: 15 min\nThis step involves measuring luminescence signal as a direct correlation with organoid viability.\nFollowing overnight (24 h) incubation of organoids in Assay Media, measure luminescence using a plate reading luminometer with a suitable integration time (0.25 s–1 s).\nNote: In this protocol, an EnSight® Multimode Plate Reader with Kaleido™ data acquisition & analysis software was used. The EnSight® Multimode Plate Reader was maintained at 37°C and an integration time of 1 s was used.\nCritical: Protect the assay from direct light to reduce degradation of the RealTime-Glo™ MT Cell Viability Substrate.\nCritical: The assay should be maintained at, or as close to, 37°C when measuring luminescence. This is critical to the performance of the RealTime-Glo™ MT Cell Viability Assay. A luminometer with temperature control is recommended. If a luminometer with temperature control is unavailable, users should measure luminescence immediately after removing their assay from the 37°C incubator to prevent cooling.\nCritical: Luminometers that are in a Class II biological safety cabinet are recommended to maintain sterility.\nAfter measuring luminescence, proceed to the next step (imaging).\nImage organoids\nTiming: 3–10 h\nThis step involves imaging organoids for quantification of diameter as a surrogate measure of organoid growth. This is important as it is difficult to determine whether a reduced luminescence signal observed from the RealTime-Glo™ MT Cell Viability Assay is due to organoid senescence or death.\nImmediately after measuring luminescence, take photomicrographs of each well using an inverted microscope with suitable magnification, z-stack capability, and an on-stage incubator with temperature and CO2 control.",
    "Note: In this protocol, an IX81 Olympus inverted microscope with OlyVIA image software was used. The stage incubator of the IX81 Olympus inverted microscope was pre-heated to 37°C with 10% CO2. The IX81 Olympus microscope is automated and motorized, allowing for specific stage positions to be saved. This allows for precise imaging of organoid wells at the same position for the duration of the assay.\nNote: Users are required to determine the upper and lower z-stack limits and associated step sizes for their assay. In this protocol, a z-stack involving 10 steps spaced ∼50 μm apart was used.\nCritical: Users should acquire multiple photos of each well per time point. The number of photos acquired will depend on the number of z-stack step sizes used.\nCritical: Protect the assay from direct light to reduce degradation of the RealTime-Glo™ MT Cell Viability Substrate.\nSecure the assay plate to the microscope stage.\nTake full-well photomicrographs of each organoid well with suitable upper and lower z-stack limits and associated step sizes.\nAfter imaging is complete, return the assay to a 37°C, 10% CO2 incubator.\nTreat with test compound(s)\nTiming: 30 min\nThis step involves the preparation and addition of test compound(s) to organoids. Viability and growth can be measured by luminescence and microscopy, respectively, at various time points.\nDilute desired concentrations of test compound(s) at 2× in Assay Media.\nOverlay 100 μL of diluted test compound(s) to the pre-existing 100 μL per well at a 2× concentration (to make 1×).\nNote: This approach allows users to avoid unnecessary aspiration of existing media, which may increase the risk of damaging organoids.\nReturn the assay to the incubator and remove only when measuring viability and imaging organoids at desired time points.",
    "Note: We have previously used this protocol to measure organoid viability and growth over 11 consecutive days. However, users are required to optimize the maximum amount of time that their organoids can be maintained in culture for this assay.\nAnalysis\nTiming: 10 h\nThis step involves quantification of organoid viability and growth by measuring luminescence and diameter, respectively.\nNote: This protocol allows users to measure the viability of the same organoids over the course of treatment. This is an advantage over existing lysis-based methods,8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9],9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10],10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11],11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] where quantification of organoid viability can only be performed at a single experimental end-point.\nQuantification of organoid viability by luminescence\nThe RealTime-Glo™ MT Cell Viability Assay measures the metabolic activity of viable organoids, which is provided as a luminescence signal. The amount of luminescence signal measured by a luminometer is expressed in units known as Relative Light Units (RLUs). Therefore, RLUs correlate with viability.\nNote: In this protocol, RLUs of each well were collected using an EnSight® Multimode Plate Reader with Kaleido™ data acquisition & analysis software.\nExample RLUs and calculation of fold-change in viability across two time points are shown in Tables 2–4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]; [href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]; [href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4] (3 biological replicates B1-B3, each comprising technical triplicates n1-n3).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2480_4.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2480_5.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2480_6.csv\nCalculate corrected RLUs as follows:\nCalculate the average RLU (i.e., from technical triplicates) of blank wells and each experimental condition:\nA\nv\ne\nr\na\ng\ne\nR\nL\nU\n=\nT\ne\nc\nh\nn\ni\nc\na\nl\nt\nr\ni\np\nl\ni\nc\na\nt\ne\ns\nn\n1\n+\nn\n2\n+\nn\n3\n3\nSubtract the average RLU of blank wells from the average RLU of each experimental condition to determine the corrected RLU:\nC\no\nr\nr\ne\nc\nt\ne\nd\nR\nL\nU\n=\nA\nv\ne\nr\na",

Photomicrographs of each well were captured using an Olympus IX81 microscope (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2480-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Representative single z-stack photomicrograph of an organoid well at Day 5\nA line was drawn across each organoid at each time point to quantify growth. Number in brackets correspond to specific organoids. Only organoids that are in focus were measured in this image. Remaining organoids were quantified in other z-stack images where a clearer image was obtained. Measurements shown are the diameter of each organoid. Scale bar: 1 mm.",
    "Note: Users will have acquired multiple photos of each well per time point. The number of photos acquired will depend on the number of z-stack step sizes used.\nCalculate the diameter of each organoid by drawing a line spanning the width of an organoid using the Measure function in the OlyVIA image software.\nRepeat until the diameter of every organoid is determined.\nCritical: Users should only measure organoids that are in focus (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) and avoid measuring the same organoid that may be captured in more than one image. Thus, users will need to identify the clearest image of each organoid in a z-stack for quantification.\nNote: Other image analysis software (e.g., ImageJ) may also be used to manually draw lines for measuring diameters.\nCalculate the organoid diameter range by subtracting the diameter of the smallest organoid from the diameter of the largest organoid at Day 0. Divide this value by 3 to determine the diameter range for small, medium, and large organoids.\nO\nr\ng\na\nn\no\ni\nd\nd\ni\na\nm\ne\nt\ne\nr\nr\na\nn\ng\ne\n=\nL\na\nr\ng\ne\ns\nt\no\nr\ng\na\nn\no\ni\nd\nd\ni\na\nm\ne\nt\ne\nr\n−\ns\nm\na\nl\nl\ne\ns\nt\no\nr\ng\na\nn\no\ni\nd\nd\ni\na\nm\ne\nt\ne\nr\n3\nAssign each organoid into either small, medium, or large groups.\nCalculate the percentage of each organoid size at each time point by dividing the number of small, medium, or large organoids by the total number of organoids counted per well.\nP\ne\nr\nc\ne\nn\nt\na\ng\ne\no\nf\n(\ns\ni\nz\ne\n)\no\nr\ng\na\nn\no\ni\nd",
