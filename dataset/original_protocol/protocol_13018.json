    "1. Preparation of flow chambers\nNOTE: Microfluidic flow chambers will be constructed by adhering polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchannels to a cleaned and functionalized cover glass. The microchannels will be cast in a master mold.\nPreparation of PDMS channels\nPrepare cleaned and/or functionalized cover glasses with surface chemistry appropriate to the specific assay being imaged.\n\t\tNOTE: For kinesin motility assays, piranha-cleaned silanized cover glasses are used. These are prepared as described in Gell et. al.1 Alternatively, a simpler procedure is to sonicate cover glasses in isopropanol followed by methanol for 3x 20 min cycles.\nTo prepare a master mold, cut strips of single-sided stationary tape to the desired flow channel size. Adhere the strips to the bottom of a 10 cm Petri dish, arranging them side-to-side with at least 1 cm spacing between the strips.\n\t\tNOTE: If precise channel dimensions are required, the mold can be fabricated on silicon wafers using photolithography14.\nTo prepare the PDMS polymer, combine the curing agent and the base elastomer in a 1:10 mass ratio. Mix for 2 min.\n\t\tNOTE: This mixing ratio can be varied to tune the stiffness of the polymer. A higher ratio of base to curing agent results in a softer polymer.\nDegas the mixture in a vacuum chamber until all bubbles disappear.\nPour the mixture onto the master mold in a ~0.5 cm thick layer, taking care to avoid creating bubbles.\nBake the mixture in a preheated oven at 70 °C for 40 min.\n\t\tNOTE: A longer curing time may be required if the PDMS block is thick (>1 cm). Continue heating in 5 min increments until it is fully cured.\nCut out the structured regions of the polymer. Punch holes at each end of the channel using a PDMS puncher.",
    "NOTE: In this protocol, the hole diameter is set to 0.75 mm and can be adjusted according to the required flow rates. PDMS channels can be stored in dry environments for extended periods but should be cleaned prior to use.\nClean the structured side of the PDMS block. Use stationary tape to remove large particles. Rinse with isopropanol and then methanol. Repeat these rinses 3x, rinse with ultrapure water, and blow-dry the surface.\nPlasma clean the PDMS using oxygen or air plasma.\n\t\tNOTE: In this protocol, 18 W air plasma is used.\nPlace the plasma cleaned PDMS on an appropriately cleaned cover glass and heat on a hot plate at 80 °C for 15 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Epoxy resin can be applied to the sides of the PDMS block to better adhere it to the cover glass.\nInsert appropriately sized low-density polyethylene (LDPE) tubing into the holes. Connect the outlet tubing to a 0.5 mL syringe.\n\t\tNOTE: In this protocol, tubes with an inner diameter of 0.023 in are connected to the PDMS via a 0.025 in outer diameter metal adaptor.\nFlow solutions into the microchannels by immersing the inlet tube in the solution and drawing the required volume with the syringe.\n2. Optical setup\nModification of the microscope (Figure 1)\nModify a TIRF microscope to enable IRM imaging13. Replace the 50/50 (Reflectance (R)/Transmission (T)) beam splitter used in the filter wheel of the microscope with a 10/90 (R/T) beam splitter.\nInsert an image splitter between the camera and the microscope.\nIn the filter cube of the image splitter, insert a 10/90 (R/T) beam splitter. Place a 600 nm long-pass filter in front of the reflected beam and an appropriate fluorescence emission filter in front of the transmitted beam.",
    "NOTE: Beam splitters with different R/T ratios can be used to tune the fractions of the IRM and TIRF emission light that are collected.\nAlign the image splitter according to the manufacturer's specifications to spatially separate the TIRF and IRM signals on the camera chip.\n\t\t​NOTE: Spatial separation of the signals is required because the TIRF signal of typical fluorophores is much weaker than the IRM signal of a microtubule and would not be detectable if the two signals were overlayed.\n3. Imaging dynamic microtubules and single Kinesin molecules\nSurface functionalization and passivation\nFlow BRB80 buffer (80 mM Na-PIPES, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl2, titrated to pH 7.8 with NaOH) into the reaction chamber.\nFlow antibiotin solution diluted to 0.025 mg/mL in BRB80 and incubate at room temperature for 10 min.\nWash the channel with BRB80.\nFlow in F-127 solution (1% Pluronic F-127 (w/v) dissolved in BRB80 overnight) and incubate for at least 20 min for surface passivation.\n\t\tNOTE: If easy-cleaned cover glasses are used instead of silanized cover glasses, passivate using 2 mg/mL casein in BRB80 for >20 min at room temperature.\nWash the channel with BRB80.\nPreparation for imaging\nIf temperature control is required, use an objective heater and set it to the correct temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: In this protocol, all the experiments are performed at 28 °C.\nPlace the sample on the microscope stage and turn on the epiillumination light source (>600 nm) for IRM imaging.\n\t\tNOTE: In this protocol, a white LED light source is used with a 600 nm long-pass filter.\nFocus the microscope on the sample surface. Look for the correct focal plane near the PDMS-solution interface.\n\t\tNOTE: In IRM, the aqueous interior of the channel should appear much brighter than the PDMS polymer.",
    "Pick a field of view near the center of the channel.\nPrepare a solution of 0.1 µm fluorescent microbeads in BRB80 (density: 109 beads/mL, corresponding to a 200-fold dilution for the beads used in this protocol).\nFlow in at least one channel volume of the microbead solution.\nMonitor the reaction via IRM. Wait for the microbeads to gradually \"land\" onto the surface. When the desired density of microbeads is achieved, wash out the excess with BRB80.\nGrowing biotinylated guanylyl 5'-α,β-methylenediphosphonate (GMPCPP)-stabilized microtubule seeds\nIn a 0.6 mL centrifuge tube, prepare 50 μL of a solution containing 1 mM GMPCPP, 1 mM MgCl2, and 2 μM biotinylated tubulin (5-10% labeling stoichiometry) in BRB80.\n\t\tNOTE: The correct labeling stoichiometry can be achieved by combining high-density biotinylated tubulin with unlabeled bovine tubulin in the correct ratio.\nIncubate the solution on ice for 5 min, then incubate at 37 °C for 12.5 min.\n\t\tNOTE: The length of the seeds can be controlled by tuning the polymerization time.\nStop the polymerization by adding 100 μL of room temperature BRB80.\nSpin down the solution in an ultracentrifuge at room temperature (126,000 x g, 5 min). Discard the supernatant by using a pipette to remove unpolymerized tubulin.\n\t\tNOTE: In this protocol, an air-driven ultracentrifuge is used.\nAdd 200 μL of room temperature BRB80 to the pellet. Resuspend the pellet by pipetting gently but thoroughly. Use a 200 μL pipette with a cut tip to reduce the shearing of the microtubules.\nGrowing dynamic guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-tubulin \"extensions\"\n\tNOTE: The seeds will be immobilized on the antibiotin surface of the flow channel. Dynamic GTP/GDP \"extensions\" will be grown from the ends of the immobilized seeds.\n\t\nDilute the seeds 20x in BRB80. Flow the diluted seeds into the reaction chamber.",
    "Monitor the reaction via IRM. Wait for the seeds to gradually \"land\" onto the surface and bind to it. When the desired density of seeds is achieved, wash out the excess with BRB80.\nPrepare a microtubule extension mixture: 12 μM unlabeled tubulin, 1 mM GTP, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) in BRB80 buffer.\nFlow in at least one channel volume of the extension mixture. Ensure that the reaction temperature is 28 °C.\nWait for the microtubule extensions to grow from the seeds over time.\n\t\tNOTE: The steady-state length is usually achieved in less than 20 min.\nUse the dynamic microtubules for imaging. Add and visualize fluorescent MAPs on the microtubules, as described in step 3.5 for kinesin-1.\n\t\tNOTE: Because the microtubules are surface-bound, they are easily visible by TIRF.\nKinesin motility assay\n\tNOTE: This step describes a protocol for visualizing motile green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled kinesin-1 on shrinking microtubules. A truncated rat kinesin-1 construct fused to eGFP (rKin430-eGFP) was expressed and purified, as described previously15,16.\n\t\nPrepare motility buffer: 1 mM ATP and 0.2 mg/mL casein in BRB80.\nDilute kinesin-eGFP in motility buffer to 10 nM.\nPrepare a 2x oxygen scavenger solution to counteract oxidative photobleaching (80 mM glucose, 80 mg/mL glucose oxidase, 32 mg/mL catalase, 0.2 mg/mL casein, 20 mM DTT) supplemented with 2 mM ATP.\nCombine 10 parts of oxygen scavenger, 9 parts of BRB80, and 1 part of 10 nM kinesin-eGFP for a final kinesin concentration of 0.5 nM.\n\t\tNOTE: The total volume should be at least 1.5-fold larger than the channel volume.\nSet the imaging settings on the microscope software.\n\t\tNOTE: In this protocol, videos are recorded at 10 fps with 100 ms exposure time. The laser intensity is ~0.05 kW/cm2.\nBegin imaging and flow the kinesin solution into the chamber.",
    "After the measurement is complete, record a short (~5 s) video in which the stage is slowly translated in a circular or lateral motion. Use the median projection of this video as a background image and subtract it from the raw measurements.\n4. Image processing and analysis\nNOTE: Image processing was carried out using NIH ImageJ2 (imagej.nih.gov/ij/). A macro was developed to automate the splitting and alignment of the TIRF and IRM channels. This macro requires the GaussFit_OnSpot plugin to be installed (available on the ImageJ plugins repository).\nFrom the background recording, create a median projection in ImageJ by clicking on Image | Stacks | Z-project.\nSubtract the median background projection from the raw image data by clicking on Process | Image Calculator.\n\tNOTE: Make sure to check the “32-bit (float) result\" option.\nFor image registration, pick a collection of microbeads near the microtubule of interest and use them to align the TIRF and IRM images.\nFor each bead in this collection, use the multipoint selection tool to mark the approximate location in the TIRF channel and then the corresponding location in the IRM channel.\n\tNOTE: For example, if there are two beads (1 and 2), the multipoint selection would have four points in the following order: (1) bead 1 in TIRF, (2) bead 1 in IRM, (3) bead 2 in TIRF, (4) bead 2 in IRM.\nRun the provided ImageJ macro (ImageSplitterRegistration.ijm).",
    "NOTE: This automates the following steps: i) estimating the center location of each bead by fitting to a Gaussian; ii) for each bead, computing the displacement vector separating the center in the TIRF channel from the center in the IRM channel; iii) averaging this displacement vector across all beads; iv) splitting the TIRF and IRM channels into separate images; v) translating the TIRF image by the average displacement vector computed in iii; vi) overlaying the TIRF and IRM images in a multichannel .tiff file."
