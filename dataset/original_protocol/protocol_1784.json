    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTumor dissection and dissociation\nTiming: 1 h 45 min\nThis step describes our approach to dissect and dissociate brain tumor tissue. The expected outcome after dissociation is a high yield of mixed cell subpopulations that comprise the tumor stroma and the tumor microenvironment (TME). The applications for the resultant cells (either with or without enrichment for a particular cell subpopulation) that we mostly use are: staining for FACS analysis, RNA extraction, and cell culture.\nNote: Sterile conditions during the protocol depend on the final procedure to be executed with the cells. However, we do advise working in a biological hood, in order to keep all the reagents sterile for further use and applications.\nAnesthetize mice at the desired time point.\nNote: We usually use a Ketamine (100mg/mL)/Xylazine(200mg/mL) combination by preparing the mix of 3:1 ratio, giving a dose of 70 μL per 10g of mouse.\nNote: The desired time point depends on the researcher’s questions, hypothesis and model. In Magod et al. 3 time points were used: 2, 5 and 8 weeks. The last one corresponds with the endpoint of our R53 model, by then the mice are already showing symptoms (hunched back, difficulty to walk, loss of body weight) and are close to death.\nNote: We usually work with mice aged 7–8 weeks at the time of the injection. No gender preferences were considered in this study. Mice species are detailed in key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table].\nDissect brain tumors.\nPerfuse the mice with sterile ice-cold PBS.\nIsolate the brain and transfer it to sterile 10cm transparent plate.\nDissect the brain tumors under fluorescent microscope.",
    "Note: Tumor tissue is easily identifiable in our model as GFP+ (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). For similar approach in the dissection a model with a fluorescent reporter is needed. The transfer vector used in our system contains HRasV12 oncogene, a hairpin targeting p53, and a GFP reporter (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) (Friedmann-Morvinski et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nTransfer the tumor to a well of a 6-well plate containing cold HBSS−/−.\nNote: Keep plate with tumors on ice until further use.\nDissociate tumor tissue using a Neural Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) according to manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/neural-tissue-dissociation-kits.html#gref[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/neural-tissue-dissociation-kits.html#gref]).\nNote: For this step, we use a gentleMACS™Dissociator (MiltenyiBiotec, Cat#130-093-235)\nNote: This protocol describes the amounts necessary for 1 mouse. Increase the amounts by the number of mice to be processed.\nPrepare enzyme 1 mix (1900μL buffer x + 50μL enzyme P) according to manufacturer’s instructions and warm up in C tubes for 15 min.\nAspirate the HBSS−/− and cut the tumor into small pieces (2–3mm).\nAdd enzyme 1 mix on top of chopped dissected tissue, then transfer it back to C tube. Cut end of P1000 tip to transfer chopped tissue easily.\nRun “m_brain_01” protocol on gentleMACS™ tissue dissociator (pre-programmed by manufacturer).\nIncubate at 37°C for 15 min.\nRun “m_brain_02” protocol on gentleMACS™ tissue dissociator (pre-programmed by manufacturer).\nPrepare enzyme A mix according to manufacturer’s instructions (20μL buffer Y + 10μL enzyme A). Then add the mix to the C tube containing tissue homogenate.\nIncubate at 37°C for 10 min.\nRun “m_brain_03” protocol on gentleMACS™ tissue dissociator (pre-programmed by manufacturer).\nAdd 3mL of cold HBSS +/+ into C tube in order to stop reaction.\nTransfer the content from the C tube into a Falcon tube through a 70μm cell strainer.\nAdd 3mL of HBSS+/+ into C tube to wash and repeat step j.",
    "Grind the remaining tissue pieces against the mesh. Use the rubber tip of a syringe and add HBSS +/+ to help (Usually 1 mL before you start grinding and 1mL once you finish) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] and Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nNote: For a better myelin separation we recommend performing all the further spin steps at 4°C.\nSpin the Falcon tube at 300g for 10min.\nPrepare Percoll gradient mix.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1373_3.csv\nResuspend the pellet in percoll gradient mix (25mL). Add on top 5mL of cold PBS SLOWLY!!! To create the gradient (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A)\nSpin for 20 min at 950g. NO BREAK.\nCritical: In this step it is critical to work in a no break regime in the centrifuge, for both acceleration and break. Gradient and further myelin layer formed in centrifugation are quite fragile.\nAspirate the myelin layer first, then the rest of the supernatant (both PBS and Percoll layers) without disturbing the pellet (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nNote: We recommend to vacuum the myelin layer first given it is not very compact and may get carried on as the rest of the supernatant is removed.\nResuspend in 0.5% BSA in 1× PBS. 10mL for each brain.\nNote: We advise to continue with the rest of the protocol as soon as possible. If needed, cells can be kept on ice. However, both time and temperature of storage have effects on cell viability, as seen in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].",
    "Alternatives: This protocol can also be achieved without a gentleMACS™ tissue dissociator. Prepare a set of 3 glass Pasteur pipettes by changing their diameter using fire. These pipettes will be used to break down the tissue homogenates by pipetting several times, mocking the action of the different protocols from the gentleMACS™ tissue dissociator. Pipettes should be used in decreasing diameter order as you move forward in the steps. Special caution to bubble formation while resuspending the homogenate. While this is a good alternative, the use of the gentleMACS™ tissue dissociator is preferred. Higher yields are possible and the protocol is more accurate and less time consuming. Bordt et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] give a detailed and very illustrative instruction on how to use shear force of successively smaller Pasteur pipets for tissue dissociation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1373-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "Methods video S1. Use of plunger rubber tip to finish grinding digested tissue against the mesh, related to step 3m\nImmune cell-subpopulation enrichment and staining for FACS analysis\nTiming: 3 h 30 min\nIn this part of the protocol we describe how to isolate the immune cell population from the whole-tumor cell suspension obtained in the previous step. Here we also describe our staining protocol for further TME composition analysis.\nNote: Sterile conditions are not required since cells will be stained for FACS analysis.\nProceed to immune cell enrichment using CD45 murine MicroBeads (MiltenyiBiotec, Cat#130-052-301). Follow manufacturer’s instructions according to the MS Columns protocol (https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/ms-columns.html#gref[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/ms-columns.html#gref]).\nNote: This protocol describes procedure for one sample. Increase the amounts by the number of samples to be processed.\nCount the cells and divide them according to the column’s capacity. Additionally, take 1 million cells to stain with CD45 to estimate % of total CD45+ cells in the tumor.\nCritical: Take into consideration column capacity, which is 10 million magnetically labeled cells from up to 20 million total cells. For the amount of CD45+ percentage we expect in our type of samples we advise to take up to 20 million live cells from the whole-tumor cell suspension.\nTransfer the cells to 15mL Falcon tubes.\nNote: From this step all the spin steps could be done at room temperature (RT; 15°C–25°C).\nSpin the cells at 300g for 10 min\nResuspend each pellet in 90μL of 0.5% BSA in PBS. Add 10μL of CD45microbeads.\nIncubate 15 min at 4°C.\nWash with 1mL of 0.5% BSA, then centrifuge sample for 10min at 300g.\nAspirate the supernatant and then resuspend pellet in 500μL of 0.5% BSA.\nSet up the MS columns against the magnet stand and a falcon tube beneath it to collect CD45- cell fractions.",
    "Equilibrate the MS columns with 500μL of 0.5% BSA.\nCritical: Whenever using the MS columns avoid formation of air bubbles. Also, always wait until the column is empty before proceeding to add any more liquid.\nCritical: Clumps should be removed before adding cell suspension. Any type of filter should work.\nFilter the cell suspension through 70μm mesh.\nNote: In order to remove clumps and aggregates, we first wet the mesh of a FACS’ cup tube with 0.5% BSA (250uL should work). Then we run the whole-tumor-cell suspension through it.\nAdd the filtered cell suspension to the column.\nWash the column 3 times with 500μL of 0.5% BSA. Collect eluate in 15mL Falcon tube.\nNote: The eluate contains tumor cells and non-immune cell populations from the TME such as endothelial cells (Rousso-Nooriet al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) and astrocytes. Any of the further described procedures can be done with the CD45- fraction.\nTake the MS Column out of the magnetic stand. Quickly add 1mL of 0.5% BSA into it and immediately flush out retained fraction into a new Falcon tube labeled CD45+.\nNote: The eluate contains the enriched fraction of the immune compartment of the TME.\nStain the enriched cells for flow cytometry analysis in order to determinate TME’s myeloid and lymphoid composition.\nCount the cells and divide them according to the amount of antibody panels in use. Make sure to keep some cells for unstained or other necessary controls.\nNote: In this protocol, we work with two panels. One built to analyze the myeloid immune TME composition and another one to analyze the lymphoid immune TME component. We use from 0.5 to 1 million cells per panel.\nSpin the cells down in Eppendorf centrifuge for 5 min at 400g.\nStain with eflour-405 Live/Dead Fixable dye (eBioscience) for live-cell population.",
    "Resuspend the cell pellet in 100 μL of FACS buffer.\nAdd 1μL of eflour-405 Live/Dead Fixable dye per million cells.\nIncubate at 4°C for 30 min.\nAdd 1mL of FACS buffer to wash and spin the samples down for 5 min at 400g.\nIncubate with TruStainFcXTM-Fc blocker CD16/32 (Biolegend).\nResuspend the cell pellet in 100 μL of FACS buffer.\nAdd 1μL of Fc blocker per million cells.\nIncubate at room temperature for 15 min.\nStain the samples for 30 min at 4°C using different combinations of anti-mouse antibodies listed in key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] according to the table below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1373_4.csv\n∗Myeloid Panel ∗∗Lymphoid Panel\nAdd 1mL of FACS buffer to wash and spin the samples down for 5 min at 400g.\nResuspend in 300 μL of FACS buffer.\nRead each sample on Attune NxT Flow Cytometer.\nPerform analysis using Kaluza software v2.1 and determine the composition of the TME according to our gating strategy (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1373-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Gating strategies for flow cytometry analysis for both panels\nIn the myeloid panel, some of the gating is happening in parallel from the same parental population, indicated by appearing next to each other. Subsequent gating is separated by an arrow and appears under the parental population."
