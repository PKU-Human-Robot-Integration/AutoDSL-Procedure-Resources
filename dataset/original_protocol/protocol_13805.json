    "All in vivo experiments were performed in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animal resources of Nagoya University Animal Care and Use Committee (approval #2017-29438, #2018-30096, #2019-31234, #2020-20104). Six-week-old homozygote athymic nude mice were purchased and maintained at the Animal Center of Nagoya University. When performing the procedure in mice, they were anesthetized with isoflurane (introduction: 4-5%, maintenance 2-3%); the paw was pressed with tweezers to confirm the depth of anesthesia.\n1. Conjugation of IR700 with mAb\nIncubate mAb (1 mg, 6.8 nmol) with IR700 NHS ester (66.8 mg, 34.2 nmol, 5 mmol/L in DMSO) in 0.1 mol/L Na2HPO4 (pH 8.6) at 15-25 °C for 1 h.\nPurify the mixture using a column (e.g., Sephadex). Prepare and wash the column with PBS. Then, apply the mixture onto the column and collect the drop, which contains the purified IR700-conjugated antibody. This IR700-conjugated antibody is referred to as the antibody photosensitizer conjugate (APC).\nMeasure the protein and IR700 concentration in the APC.\n\t\nPrepare calibration curves for protein and IR700 using a spectrophotometer.\nMix standard concentrations of albumin with a protein assay kit following the kit protocol (see Table of Materials, Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) protein staining). Measure the absorbance of albumin at 595 nm wavelength, and plot the calibration curve (a linear approximation formula) for the protein using the following equation: y = ax + b (x: concentration, y: absorbance).\nObtain calibration curves for IR700 with absorption at 690 nm using the same procedure. The standard concentration of IR700 is recommended at 0.1-5 µM (0.1954-9.77 µg/mL).\nMeasure the protein concentration and IR700 concentration in the APC using a calibration curve [x = (y-b)/a (x: concentration, y: absorbance)].\nDetermine the number of IR700 dyes bound per mAb with the results of the molar concentration.",
    "NOTE: It is important to determine the optimal conjugation number of IR700 molecules per mAb molecule. Generally, approximately three IR700 molecules bound on a single mAb molecule would be effective both in vitro and in vivo. Many IR700 bound per antibody (e.g., six) makes it easier to be trapped in the liver during in vivo experiments. The ratio of antibody bound to IR700 was in the range of 1:2-1:4. The proportion of IR700 was reduced, if necessary.\nPerform sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) as a confirmation for the formation of an APC. Image the gel at 700 nm using a fluorescent imager, and stain the protein in the gel using a protein staining kit following the kit protocol (see Table of Materials, CBB protein staining).\n2. Generation of a pleural dissemination model\nPrepare luciferase-expressing target cells and suspend 1.0 × 106 target cells in 100 µL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)\n\tNOTE: Intrathoracic cancer cells such as lung cancer and MPM are suitable as target cells. Luciferase-expressing cells were prepared via luciferase gene transfection, and high expression of luciferase was confirmed after > 10 cell passages. Cells were cultured in a medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin (100 IU/mL) and streptomycin (100 mg/mL). The number of cells was adjusted according to the tumor growth rate and the time course of treatment (1.0. × 105-6.0 × 106 cells/body weight).\nPrepare 8-12-week-old female homozygote athymic nude mice, with a preferable body weight of 19-21 g.\nAnesthetize mice during the procedure with isoflurane (introduction: 4-5%, maintenance 2-3%); press the tail with tweezers to confirm that there is no reaction.",
    "Make a stopper with polystyrene foam and attach the stopper to the 30 G needle so that the tip remains at 5 mm to prevent lung injury. Bend the needle tip with clean forceps or by pressing it against a hard object cleaned with 70% EtOH to avoid pneumothorax (Figure 1).\n\tCAUTION: Be careful not to pierce oneself. Use forceps to bend the needle. Do not hold the stopper when attaching it to the needle. It is safer to stick the stopper before filling the cells into the syringe.\nFill a syringe (1 mL) with target cells, and attach a 30G needle with a stopper.\nDisinfect the chest of the animal with 70% EtOH before the procedure.\nPierce a needle into the chest of the mouse through the intercostal space. Owing to the resistance while hitting against the ribs at that time, the needle tip moved up and down. After passing through the intercostal space, press the syringe against the mouse and inject 100 µL of target cells (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: The mouse breaths deeply when the needle properly enters the chest cavity. With the bending of the needle tip, pneumothorax and inappropriate injection of cells into the lung could be avoided.\n\tNOTE: Right chest wall puncture is recommended to avoid the risk of cardiac wall puncture.\nRoll the mouse 2-3 times to spread the cells throughout the thoracic cavity.\nReturn the mouse to a clean and warm cage and monitor until ambulatory. After the procedure, the mouse will wake up from anesthesia and behave normally.\n3. Measurement of bioluminescence\nNOTE: The software used for data acquisition is listed in the Table of Materials.\nTo confirm the generation of the pleural dissemination model, evaluate the bioluminescence images every day after injecting the cells into the thoracic cavity.",
    "Anesthetize mice (step 2.3) and inject intraperitoneally with D-luciferin (15 mg/mL, 200 µL).\nEnsure that the mouse is breathing normally before and after imaging. Use a heater if necessary to prevent hypothermia during anesthesia. \nTen minutes after the injection, set the mouse in the bioluminescence imaging (BLI) measuring equipment. For image acquisition, open the Acquisition Control Panel of the software. Select Luminescent, Photograph, and Overlay (Figure 3).\nSet exposure time as Auto. Set Binning as small.\nSet f/stop as 1 for luminescent and 8 for photograph; f/stop controls the amount of light received by the charged-coupled device detector.\nSet the Field of View as C.\nOnce the mouse sample is ready for imaging, click Acquire for imaging acquisition. Mice with sufficient luciferase activity were selected for further studies.\n\tNOTE: A suitable pleural dissemination model shows strong luminescence on the diffused site in the chest when viewed from the ventral side. If the BLI images are not diffused in the thorax, and only at the injection site, the tumor may be transplanted subcutaneously.\nAfter displaying the image, set the display format to Radiance. Open the Tool Palette panel (Figure 4A).\nSelect ROI Tools. We recommend using the Circle to range the bioluminescent area on images.\nClick Measure ROIs to measure the surface bioluminescent intensity (Figure 4B).\nUse Configure Measurement on the left corner of the ROI measurement panel to select the values/information needed. Export this data table as a .csv file (Figure 4C).\nUse the values of Total Flux (p/s) as the bioluminescent intensity quantification in the .csv file.\n4. Diffuse luminescence imaging tomography (DLIT)\nNOTE: The software used for data acquisition is listed in the Table of Materials.\nTurn on the X-ray Armed button.",
    "Anesthetize the mice (step 2.3) and then inject D-luciferin (15 mg/mL, 200 µL) intraperitoneally into the mice. To shoot DLIT continuously from 3.2 to 3.7, skip this step.\nTen minutes after injection, set the mouse in the BLI equipment.\nOpen the Acquisition Control Panel of the software. Select Luminescent, Photograph, CT, Standard-One Mouse, and Overlay. Other settings were the same as in 3.4-3.6 (Figure 5A).\nSelect the Imaging Wizard on the Acquisition Control Panel.\nSelect Bioluminescence and then DLIT (Figure 5B).\nSelect Firefly as the wavelength to measure (Figure 5C).\nSet the Imaging Subject as Mouse, Exposure parameters as Auto Settings, Field of View as C-13.4 cm, and Subject Height as 1.5 cm (Figure 5D).\nPush the X-rays will be produced when energized. Acquire.\nOpen the CT sequential image data.\nOpen Surface Topography on the Tool Palette. Select Show (Figure 6A).\nAdjust the threshold as the purple display shows only the body surface (Figure 6B). Then, select the Subject Nude Mouse and click the Generate Surface. Make sure that the outline of the mouse is accurately drawn (Figure 6C).\nOpen the Tool Palette, DLIT 3D Reconstruction Properties tab. Select Tissue Properties as Mouse Tissue and Source Spectrum as Firefly (Figure 6D). Next, open the Analyze tab and confirm the data for each selected wavelength data. Finally, click the Reconstruct button (Figure 6E).\nConfirm the presence of BLI in the chest cavity in the configured DLIT image.\n5. NIR-PIT for in vivo pleural dissemination model\nMeasure the light dose of 690 nm wavelength (NIR) laser with a power meter, and adjust the output to 100 mW/cm2.",
    "NOTE: The laser light is coherent with a precise coil size; thus, the light energy hardly changes regardless of the distance within 50 cm. If there are many adverse events, such as burns, reduce the output within the range of 40 mW/cm2.\nClean the tail with 70% EtOH and intravenously inject APC (100 µg) via the tail vein 24 h before NIR irradiation. Apply pressure to the injection site to control bleeding.\n\tNOTE: Adjust the volume of APC to 50-200 µL for injection.\nAnesthetize the mice (step 2.3), and lay them on their back. To avoid NIR irradiation to the non-target site, shield other sites with aluminum foil (Figure 7A). Irradiate with NIR light with a laser of 100 J/cm2; if the tumor is disseminated back to the belly, the NIR-light irradiation dose could be divided in multiple directions (Figure 7B).\n\tNOTE: Adjust the dose at 30-150 J/cm2 depending on the in vitro results and adverse events such as burns.\nWhen the NIR irradiation is complete and the mouse is awake, return it to the cage.\nObserve the BLI and measure the ROI over time (every day) (See 3.2-3.12).\nFor ex vivo imaging, euthanize mice with carbon dioxide 24 h after the APC injection, immediately before the NIR irradiation.\n\t\nTo observe the inside of the chest of the mouse, remove the thorax and cut the ribs and sternum. Capture the fluorescence image (700 nm) alongside the control without APC administration. Then, apply D-luciferin (150 µg/mL) over the exposed thorax, and the BLI was taken (refer 3.2-3.7).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
