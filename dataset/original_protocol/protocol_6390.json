    "Preparation of the gold disk sensor (Figure 5)Place the bare gold disk carefully in a 6-well plate using a pair of tweezers, keeping the gold surface facing upwards.Add the solution of 11-MUA (Recipe 1) and cover the plate carefully.Incubate the disk overnight in this solution to obtain a uniform layer of thiols over the gold surface. The plate is covered with foil and incubated at room temperature.Next day, wash three times with ethanol to remove excess thiol groups. For this, pipette out the 11-MUA solution and pipette in ethanol. The volume of the ethanol should be just enough to completely immerse the disk. Gently shake the plate to rinse the disk.To remove ethanol, wash thrice with demineralized water, while gently shaking the plate for rinsing the gold disk.After thorough washing, blow-dry the disk by flushing the well with nitrogen gas.These disks can now be stored up to 2 months in their container at room temperature.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200218/20200218172059_7018.jpgFigure 5. Preparation of the gold sensor disk. The diagram explains all the steps for the Steps A1 to A7 as mentioned in the text.Setting up the sensor disk (Figure 6)Put a small drop of the immersion oil on the outer edge of the hemi-cylinder.Place the 11-MUA coated gold disk on the other end using a pair of tweezers. Now, simply push the disk carefully by sliding till it is correctly set on the hemi-cylinder.Make sure the gold surface is facing upwards.No air bubble should be present between the disk and the immersion oil on the hemi-cylinder.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200218/20200218172138_1541.jpgFigure 6. Setting up the gold disk on the hemi-cylinder. B1. The hemi-cylinder is prepared by adding a drop of immersion oil on it. B2. The coated gold disk is placed on the oil drop and slid through using a pair of tweezers.",
    "Immobilization of the protein (Figure 7)Pass Buffer 1 (Coupling Buffer) over the modified gold disk. This hydrates the gold surface and stabilizes the thiol layer (Recipe 10).In the 384-well microplate, dispense out all the solutions required for the immobilization procedure into the wells of the column 1 as marked in Figure 7.Add 80 μl EDC (400 mM) in wells 1A and 1B, followed by 80 μl of NHS (100 mM) in both the wells 1C and 1D.Leave 1E and 1F blank for mixing of EDC and NHS. This mixture will activate the gold sensor disk for ligand protein immobilization.Add 80 μl of the ligand protein (example: 5 mg/ml of EhP3) in both 1G and 1H wells.Finally, add 80 μl of Ethanolamine (1 M) in 1I and 1J, to be used for blocking the remaining unbound area on the sensor.Place the 384-well plate onto the rack as shown in Figure 1.Use the following steps for setting the data acquisition times in the Data Acquisition Software:table:",

Each well used in the plate is marked here.Interaction studiesIn column 2 of the 384-well microplate, add different dilutions of the Analyte, i.e., protein (or different proteins) to be used for determining their association kinetics.In well 2A, add 80 μl of Analyte 1 (example: Filamin) [or one dilution (1 μM) of a single protein (example: EhCoactosin)] followed by 80 μl of Buffer 2 (Association Buffer) (Recipe 11) in well 2B as reference.Similarly, add 80 μl of all the Analytes (examples: Actophorin, Profilin A, Profilin B, Twinfilin, EhCoactosin) or (examples: 2 μM, 4 μM, 8 μM, 10 μM of EhCoactosin) into alternative wells, followed by Buffer 2 (Association buffer) in each of the consecutive wells.Use Buffer 2 as the running buffer for the assay.Use the following incubation times for interaction studies:table:\n﻿0,1\nSteps,Time\nBaseline,120 s\nAssociation,300 s\nDissociation,300 s\nRegeneration,120 s\nThe SPR assays also use controls like any other protein-protein interaction study. Bovine Serum Albumin generally serves as the negative control, i.e., unless the protein in focus binds to it specifically. BSA normally does not bind majority of the proteins. Similarly, if any known interacting protein is known, then it can be used as the positive control. Further, the buffers used in the study should be compatible to all the proteins. This can be checked by diluting a small amount of the proteins in all the buffers to be used, and check them for any precipitation."
