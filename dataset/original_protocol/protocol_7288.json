    "PDMS chamber design We used soft lithography techniques to create the microfluidics device for behavioral analysis (Qin et al., 2010). We designed the PDMS chamber in AutoCAD (Autodesk) with overall dimensions of 33.7 × 20.0 × 0.4 mm (Figure 1A), of which the behavioral arena was an area in the center totaling 27 × 15 mm (AutoCAD file available on request). The dimensions of the behavioral arena allow for easy division into a 9-grid rectangle along the length of the PDMS chamber during the data analysis step of the experiment, resulting in grids of size 3 × 15 mm. The behavioral arena is bordered at either end across the longest dimension by an array of 64 pillars of size 0.85 × 0.155 × 0.4 mm. On either side beyond the pillars is an array of four evenly spaced holes acting as gas inlets (outer holes) and outlets (middle holes), so that the total distance between the two arrays of holes is 28.7 mm. The distance between pillars is roughly 0.08 mm, allowing for smooth (non-turbulent) airflow from the gas inlets into the PDMS chamber according to simulations performed in COMSOL Multiphysics 3.4 (COMSOL Inc., 2007) (Figure 1B). When gas mixtures at two different concentrations are pumped through the inlet pairs on either end of the PDMS chamber, this non-turbulent flow allows for a smooth concentration gradient to form inside the PDMS chamber (Figure 1C).We printed the PDMS chamber design onto a film photomask (JD Photo Data) at 128,000 dpi with negative polarity. The polyester film photomask has a size of 10\" × 12\", a thickness of 0,18 mm, and is coated with an emulsion layer composed of gelatine, silver halide, and other chemicals.",
    "To make the master molds, we then spin-coated a silicon wafer with a 200-µm layer of SU-8 2150 photoresist (MicroChem, SU-8 2000 Series) at 2,000 r.p.m. for 30 s and patterned the resulting mold by photolithography. We then poured a 3 mm thick layer of PDMS prepolymer mixture (Dow Corning, Sylgard 184 Silicone Elastomer, Mat. No. 101697) over the mold and cured it for >1 day at room temperature. We then peeled the PDMS off the mold and cut off excess PDMS using a scalpel. Finally, we punched four inlets and four outlets with a 20-gauge stub adapter (BD Intramedic, Luer-Stub Adapters, catalog number: 22-044086) and connected the inlets with PE50 tubing (Figure 1D) to valves controlling the flow of different gas mixtures from a syringe pump.If no access to a microfluidics facility is available, the PDMS chamber can be produced by a commercial foundry. Send an AutoCAD file to the company and specify the depth of the device, e.g., 100 µm.

    "The day before the assay, transfer half of the plates to hypoxia chamber (Figure 2) at 7% O2 at 20 °C. Hypoxia chamber setting: Humidity, 38%; O2 concentration, 7%.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4492/bioprotoc-12-16-4492-g002.jpgFigure 2. Hypoxia chamber for worm culture. Assay plate preparation Two days before the assay, seed 90 mm NGM plates with 100 µL OP50 bacteria to form a thin bacterial food lawn, using a sterile plate spreader.On the day of the assay, strip the lawn of OP50 from the area that will be outside of the PDMS chamber, by placing a block of PDMS on the agar where no bacteria are wanted and then lifting it. This way, bacterial food is only present inside the behavioral arena, which helps to reduce escaping of the worms from the PDMS chamber.Equipment preparation Clean the PDMS chamber at the start of each assay day by dipping it in 70% ethanol in dH2O, then remove the ethanol by dipping the chamber in dH2O. Inject air through the tubing to remove any residual liquid from the tubes and chamber and allow to dry. Residual bacteria and other dirt can be stripped from the chamber with adhesive tape. Between assays on the same day, clean the PDMS chamber with dH2O only and inject air through the tubing to remove any residual liquid. After the final assay of the day, clean the PDMS chamber with 70% ethanol in dH2O, then again with dH2O.Before each assay, fill two 50 mL syringes with 7% O2, close the attached stopcock, then attach a 23-gauge Luer stub adapter to the tip of each syringe.Before each assay, fill two 50 mL syringes with 21% O2, close the attached stopcock, then attach a 23-gauge Luer stub adapter to the tip of each syringe.",
    "Aerotaxis assay Transfer 100–150 animals to the assay plate; place the animals randomly next to the food lawn, but not directly on it.Wait for 5 min until most animals have moved to the food lawn. Place a 30 × 15 × 0.2 mm PDMS microfluidic assay chamber over the animals.Connect two syringes at each end of the inlet tubing of the PDMS chamber to pump 7% O2 or 21% O2, respectively, into the chamber at a pumping rate of 1.5 mL/min (Figure 3). After 30 min, record the location of animals in the chamber with a CMOS camera mounted on a stereo microscope with white light illumination from a transmitted light base, for distribution analysis and aerotaxis index quantification.Open the images in Affinity Designer (or similar software such as Adobe Illustrator), and draw a rectangle with nine horizontal sections so that the image is equally divided into nine grids or bins from left to right (Figure 3). Count the animal number in each grid and record the numbers into an Excel file. If an animal appears across grids, count it into the grid containing the largest part of the animal’s body.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4492/bioprotoc-12-16-4492-g003.jpgFigure 3. Aerotaxis assay setup. A. Schematic representation of gas delivery system to PDMS chamber during experiments. Worms of strain AX204 are placed underneath a PDMS chamber. An O2 gradient of 7%–21% is generated by pumping 7% and 21% O2 at opposite sides of the chamber at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min with the help of a syringe pump. Residual air flows out of the chamber through two of the remaining free slots (black arrows). The last two slots are plugged, which does not affect the efficiency of the O2 gradient formation.",
