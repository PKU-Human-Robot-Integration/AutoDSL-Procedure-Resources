    "All methods described here have been approved by The Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) of The Education University of Hong Kong. Obtain written informed consent from a parent or a guardian for each child.\n1. Introduction and Warm-up\nIntroduce the child and the parent to the developmental psychology laboratory. Ensure that the child does not find out the hidden camcorder for video-recording or the adjacent observation room behind the one-way mirror. Let the individual child sit next to the experimenter at a child-sized table.\nAllow sufficient time for the child to get familiar and comfortable with the environment and the experimenter.\nOffer 3 attractive gifts for the child to pick the most desirable one. Tell the child the most desirable gift is the reward if he or she wins the following guessing game.\nLet the parent say, \"see you later\" to the child. Invite the parent to join an assistant in the adjacent observation room to observe the testing session behind the one-way mirror.\n2. The Guessing Game\nPrepare three sets of hidden objects in opaque upside-down cups placed on grooved plates in advance, and keep them out of the child's sight. Hide a single toy in the first two sets, such as a toy car and a ping-pong ball. Fill the third cup with some rice and position it upside down on the grooved plate. Handle the rice cup with care to prevent accidental spill.\nInvite the child to play a guessing game with the experimenter: \"Let's play a guessing game.\" Present a cup positioned upside down on a grooved plate. Tell the child: \"There is an object hidden in the cup. You need to guess what it is correctly for three consecutive trials to win this game.\"",
    "For the first two trials, give relevant clues for the child to \"guess\" correctly, for example, \"What is the vehicle that runs on the road?\" for the toy car, or \"What is the thing you can play with a ping-pong paddle?\" for the ping-pong ball. Congratulate the child on two consecutive wins.\nOn the final trial, present the cup with the hidden rice. Push the child's most desirable gift in front of the child and say: ''Now, we are going to play the last round of the guessing game. If you guess this one correctly, you will get this gift which you like the most; but you won't get it if you guess it wrong.\"\nEnsure that an assistant knock on the door of the laboratory at this exact instant, and ask the experimenter to exit the room for a moment.\nTell the child: ''Do not lift the cup to peek. I'll be right back.\" Then leave the room.\n3. The Transgression\nNOTE: The rice in the third cup would scatter on the plate if the child lifts the cup. The textured grooves on the plate makes it impossible for children to remove the spilled rice completely, leaving physical evidence of the transgression.\nObserve the child's behavior behind the one-way mirror. If the child peeks, record the time duration between the moment the experimenter leaves the room and the moment the child starts to peek.\nReturn to the room after 3 min if the child does not peek, or 1 min after the child starts to peek.\n4. The Lie-telling Behavior\nAsk the child: ''While I was gone, did you lift the cup to see what is inside?\", and wait for the child to respond.",
    "If the child has not peeked, ask the child to guess what is inside the cup and reveal the content of the cup, then proceed to step 6.\nIf the child has peeked and admits the transgression, tell the child, ''It was hard not to peek, wasn't it?\" and proceed to step 6.\nIf the child has peeked and lies about peeking, that is, he/she answers ''No\" despite the obvious physical evidence of transgression, look at the spilled rice and say: ''How come the rice is outside the cup?\", and then turn to the child and ask: ''Are you sure you didn't lift the cup to see what was inside?\", and wait for the child to respond.\n5. The Strategic Lie-telling\nIf the child confesses that he or she peeked, tell the child, ''It was hard not to peek, wasn't it?\" and proceed to step 6.\nIf the child continues to deny having peeked after the previous steps, ask the follow-up question: ''So how did the rice get out of the cup?\", and wait for the child to respond.\n6. Debriefing\nDebrief the child. Tell the child that this is just a game, and it is normal for children to peek or lie in this game because it is very tempting. Give each child the promised gift at the end of the session regardless of his/her response in the temptation resistance task.\nDebrief the parents. Inform the parents that the protocol is specifically designed to elicit peeking and lying behavior in children, and around half of the children peek or lie. Explain to the parents that these behaviors reflect sophisticated cognitive development and social conduct, and they are not regarded as specifically negative or naughty in this context.\n7. Data Processing and Coding",
    "Note: Interrater reliability needs to be established for all mentioned coding of the responses.\nTranscribe video-recorded children's verbal responses verbatim for coding.\nEnsure that two independent coders code at least 20% of all the observations for establishing interrater reliability.\nFor the coding of strategic lies, watch the video recordings of the observations and read the transcripts of children's responses to identify the involvement of intentions.\nResolve discrepancies between the two independent coders through discussion.\n\tNOTE: Children who did not lift the cup are coded as non-peekers, including those who simply touched the cup; children who lifted the cup are considered peekers. The peekers are further coded as truth tellers (those who admitted peeking) and liars (those who denied peeking). The liars' explanations for the scattered rice are further coded into strategic lies and non-strategic lies. Strategic lies are plausible and refer to intention (e.g., ''I just touched the cup, but the rice came out\"). Non-strategic lies lack credibility and include unconvincing explanations (e.g. ''The rice came out by itself\"), silent responses, and the response of ''I don't know.\" Children are further categorized into four groups based on the level of transgression and lie: non-peekers, truth tellers, non-strategic liars, and strategic liars. \nSubscription Required.
