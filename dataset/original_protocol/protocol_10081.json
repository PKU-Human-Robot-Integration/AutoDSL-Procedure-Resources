    "1. Obtaining and Preprocessing Microspheres\nProduce microspheres with the desired matrix encapsulated (PLA-DM)2.\n\tNOTE: It is imperative that the microspheres are of uniform size. For this reason, sieving the microspheres prior to use is essential. Although matrix decellularization and encapsulation have been detailed in previous publications2, a brief summary of the process follows.\n\t\nFirst, harvest cartilage plugs from porcine hind limbs. Decellularize the cartilage in a series of washes with 0.05% trypsin/0.5 mm tetrasodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), and 1.5% peracetic acid and 2.0% Triton X-100 for 4 h each with distilled water washes before and after each step2.\nDrain the decellularized matrix, freeze it, lyophilize, grind, and dissolve into pepsin solution. Following dissolution, mix the pepsin solution with PLA which has been dissolved in dichloromethane.\nAdd the mixture dropwise into a 3% polyvinyl alcohol in water solution. Centrifuge the resulting microspheres, rinse, drain, and lyophilize again.\n\t\tNOTE: For full details on the process see the previously published protocol2.\nSieve the microspheres.\n\t\nEnsure that all sieve plates have been thoroughly cleaned and are dry prior to use. If necessary, clean sieves using ultrasonic cleaner to ensure that all spheres are removed from the sieve.\nAssemble the sieve shaker with the 106 µm sieve tray at the top, the 53 µm tray after that, and the sieve pan at the bottom.\nPlace dry microspheres in the topmost sieve tray and place the lid on the top tray. Turn on coarse sieving for 8 to 10 min. Repeat on fine for 8 to 10 min.\n\t\tNOTE: The sieve times may need to be increased or decreased depending on the batch.",
    "Carefully remove the sieve plates one by one and place them upside down on a large weigh paper. Tap the sides gently to ensure that most of the spheres have fallen out of the sieve and onto the paper.\nDiscard the oversized spheres (>106 µm) and undersized spheres (<53 µm). Add spheres that are in the 53 to 106 µm size range to a labeled centrifuge tube with the type and batch number then place in a -20 °C freezer until further use.\n2. Microsphere Quality Control Assessments\nNote: See Figure 1.\nPerform macroscopic/visual assessment to check that the microspheres are uniform and spherical, with no aggregates present.\nAssess the microspheres using a scanning electron micrograph (SEM).\n\t\nFor this, place microspheres onto an SEM chuck and sputter coat with gold-palladium in argon atmosphere using a sputter coater to a thickness of 4 nm.\nObserve surface features, morphology, and diameters of the microspheres using a 10 kV accelerating voltage and a 10 mm working distance to ensure that production and sieving of the microspheres was successful.\n3. Filament Creation for 3D Printing\nMeasure and record the mass of the microspheres obtained from steps 2 and 3; at least 25 g is needed.\nAdd polycaprolactone (PCL) powder to the microspheres for a 1:4 weight ratio of microspheres to PCL.\nMix the powder mixture on a miniature rolling mixer at 20 rpm for 5 min then flip the container and mix at 20 rpm for an additional 5 min (see Figure 2).",
    "Many commercially available extruders (see the Table of Materials) have insulating jackets because their intended working temperatures are for traditional fused deposition modeling (FDM) filaments. Modify the extruder (if necessary) by removing the insulating material and use it in combination with desktop fans (which blow ambient air onto the extruder and extruded filament) to use of the extruder at lower temperatures.\n\tNOTE: Desktop fans which blow ambient air to cool the extruder and filament are useful for this procedure.\nSetup the equipment setup for extrusion. See Figure 3.\n\t\nSetup the extruder so that its outlet is ~60 cm from the inlet to the spooler, with a direct path from the extrusion outlet to the spooler inlet.\n\t\tNOTE: The spooler can optionally be raised 3-4 inches from the bench if it is found that the filament is drooping to the point of touching the benchtop.\nPlace a desktop fan ~15 cm from the heating jacket and direct it towards the heating jacket to offer cooling with ambient air throughout filament production. Place a second cooling fan approximately halfway between the extruder and spooler and direct it towards the extrudate to assist in cooling the filament with ambient air.\nAdjust the positioning as needed throughout the process.\nSet the modified extruder heating element to 52 °C, turn on the desktop cooling fans, and allow the instrument to come to equilibrium for 20 to 30 min. Ensure that the proper nozzle is attached to the extruder.\nJust before beginning, fill the extruder hopper with the microsphere/PCL mixture from step 3.3. Turn on the spooler and the extruder auger to initiate extrusion of filament.\nWhen the initial filament is extruded, manually pull the extrudate from the extrusion outlet with forceps and feed it to the filament spooler.",
    "The desired filament will take some time to come out of the spooler. Using separate spools or tape, clearly mark when the filament composition visually appears uniform.\nMonitor the process closely and modify parameters as necessary. Adjust the extruder temperature, extrusion auger speed, and spooler speed to obtain a 1.75 mm diameter filament as measured by calipers. Adjust the fans as needed to cool the filament properly to avoid non-circular filament cross-sections. Mix and refill the hopper as necessary.\n\tNOTE: Close attention is required during this process to obtain adequate filament for subsequent 3D printing. The above parameters will change depending on the ambient conditions, the fill level and uniformity of the mixture in the hopper, and the thermodynamics and flow dynamics of the specific batches of PCL and microspheres.\nContinue extruding until all of the powder has been used and the hopper is almost empty. Add PCL powder (without microspheres) to the hopper to flush out the microsphere mixture that is currently in the extruder. Continue adding PCL powder to the hopper until no more microspheres are visible in the extrudate.\nBe sure to label and separate the filament which contains the microspheres in the desired concentration, as after the filament is cooled it is harder to distinguish the uniform filament from non-uniform filament.\nContinue extruding until there is minimal powder left in the hopper, then turn off the spooler, extruder auger, extruder heating element, and fans.\n4. Printing with the Filament\nDesign a geometry of the desired shape and form using a computer aided design software. Then slice the model and dictate the toolpath using slicing software that is compatible with the 3D printing machine being used.",
    "Load the filament from step 3 onto any standard FDM printer, fitted with standard nozzles of the desired diameter (typically 0.4 mm). Begin the print (typically at 65-70 °C and 300 mm/min linear speed) as the custom filament is deposited layer-by-layer by the machine.\nMake sure to pay special attention to the first layer and adjust settings as needed to get a good quality print.\n\tNOTE: Adjustments may be made to the print speed, print temperature, platform temperature, extrusion multiplier, and other parameters. Refer to the printer and slicing manufacturer's troubleshooting guide for further assistance.\n5. Quality Control Assessment\nPlace the printed constructs on SEM chucks and sputter coat with gold-palladium in argon atmosphere using a sputter coater to a thickness of 4 nm.\nObserve under the microscope using a 10 kV accelerating voltage and a 10 mm working distance to check surface features and for the presence or absence of microspheres if applicable.\n6. Functional Testing of the Printed Constructs\nNOTE: Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) can be used as a surrogate for decellularized matrix to determine if encapsulated proteins are biologically active after the filament production process. ALP is used because it catalyzes a reaction from a substrate, p-nitrophenyl phosphate, to change from colorless to yellow byproducts, p-nitrophenol and inorganic phosphate, but only if ALP is in the functional conformation.\nPrint a geometry (n = 3) that has an end mass of at least 400 mg with the ALP microsphere filament (PLA-ALP/PCL) using identical print parameters as the PLA-DM/PCL scaffolds. Also print PCL-only (PCL(-)) scaffolds of the same geometry as the PLA-ALP/PCL scaffolds. Submerge them in 1 mL Tris-HCl buffer and incubate for 24 h at 37 °C and 110 rpm rotation to allow enzyme diffusion.",
    "Add 1 mL of 1 mg/mL p-nitrophenyl phosphate, disodium hexahydrate in Tris-HCl. Incubate at 37 °C, 110 rpm for an additional 10 h. Read the supernatant absorbance at 415 nm.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
