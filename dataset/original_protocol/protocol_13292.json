    "The protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the National Institute of Medical Sciences and Nutrition Salvador Zubirán (REF. 3057). To conduct BIA measurements, tetrapolar multiple-frequency equipment was used (see Table of Materials). This equipment provided accurate raw values for the resistance (R), reactance (Xc), and phase angle (PhA) at a frequency of 50 kHz, which allowed the impedance to be measured with the best signal-to-noise ratio. The adhesive electrodes used needed to correspond to the manufacturer's recommendations. Informed written consent was obtained from the patients involved in the study.\n1. Experimental and patient preparation\nNOTE: These steps were performed before performing a BIA measurement.\nPeriodically test the equipment to check the accuracy of impedance measurements by using a test resistor with a known value of 500 Ω (range: 496-503 Ω).\nEducate the personnel performing the BIA measurements according to the manufacturer's instructions and the tetrapolar method described in the literature36.\n\tNOTE: The patient must fast for at least 4-5 h. If the patient is lucid and conscious, explain the procedure that will be conducted.\nRemove the shoe and sock from the right foot and any metal objects that have contacts with the patient's skin, such as bracelets, watches, rings, and chains.\n\tNOTE: If the right foot has an injury, bandage it, and switch to the left side (if neither foot is available to be uncovered and for the placement of electrodes, BIA measurements cannot be performed).\nPlace the patient in a supine or semi-fowler position according to the patient's tolerance, with their legs and arms spread at an angle of about 45°. In patients with obesity, place a sheet between their thighs to avoid contact between them.\nConnect the lead wires to the equipment; there are indications showing the correct way to connect them.\n2. BIA measurement",
    "Identify the area in which the electrodes will be placed. With a 70% alcohol pad, clean these surfaces and wait until the alcohol dries to place the electrodes (the location of the electrodes was previously described)37.\n\t​NOTE: For details on BIA measurement, refer to the protocol previously described37.\n3. Analysis of BIA raw parameters on the R-Xc Z-score graph\nDownload the BIVA tolerance software by Piccolli38 (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: The software includes seven workbook sheets (Guide/Reference population/Point graph/Path/Subjects/Z-scores/Z-graph).\nClick on the Reference population sheet, choose the reference population according to the patient's characteristics, and copy and paste it into the first yellow row.\n\tNOTE: The software only reads the first yellow row, which is where the reference population is placed. The reference populations go from 1 to 10 (Popul code column), and they are shown in the rows below the yellow one.\nClick on the Z-score sheet, insert the reference population, and enter the patient's data into the second row.\n\tNOTE: The reference population data include the population code (Popul Code), the number of patients included in the reference population (Popul Size, N), the mean resistance in ohms by height in m2 (R/H Mean), the standard deviation of the resistance in ohms by height in m2 (R/H SD), the mean reactance in ohms by height in m2 (Xc/H Mean), and the standard deviation of reactance in ohms by height in m2 (Xc/H SD). These data are shown in the reference population sheet (columns A to F).\n\t\nInsert the medical record number of each patient into the Subject ID field (column G).\nInsert a number between 1 and 10 into the Group Code field (column H).\nInsert the resistance value obtained with BIA and adjusted by height in meters into the R/H subject field (column I).",
    "Insert the reactance value obtained with BIA and adjusted by height in meters into the Xc/H subject field (column J).\nInsert a value of 1 into the Drawing option field (column K) to create a plot; to skip rows, leave the cell blank.\nClick on the spreadsheet program menu, click on the Complements tab, and click the CALCULATE button.\n\t​NOTE: The Z(R) score (column L) Z(Xc) score (column M) will be automatically calculated.\nClick on the Z-graph sheet; then, in the spreadsheet program menu, click the Add-ins tab and the New graph button.\nPerform BIVA Z-score and phase angle analyses following step 4 and step 5.\n4. Interpretation and analysis of the BIVA Z-score\nNOTE: Identify the four patterns in the R-Xc Z-score graph. In the extremes along the major axis, the lower pattern is associated with congestion, whereas the upper pattern is associated with dehydration status. In the extremes along the minor axis, the left pattern is associated with more cell mass in soft tissues, whereas the right pattern is associated with less cell mass in soft tissues. To calculate the bivariate Z-score from the mean age of the group, the following formula is used: Z(R) = (R/H mean age group - R/H mean value in the reference population) / standard deviation of the reference population and Z(Xc) = (Xc/H mean age of the group - Xc/H mean value in the reference population) / standard deviation of the reference population.\nVisualize and identify the 50%, 75%, and 95% ellipses. The x (reactance) and y (resistance) axes show the standard deviations.\n\tNOTE: The sex-specific R-Xc Z-score graph is classified according to the hydration status and BCM, and all vectors within the 75% tolerance ellipse are considered to indicate tissue with normal impedance.",
    "Identify the axis of the hydration status and classify the vector.\n\tNOTE: Vectors that fall below the 75% tolerance ellipse in the lower pole indicate congestion, whereas all vectors that fall within the 75% tolerance ellipse indicate no congestion. Vectors falling outside the 75% tolerance ellipse of the upper pole are considered to indicate dehydration status.\nIdentify the BCM axis on the graph and classify the vector.\n\tNOTE: Vectors with displacement to the left side are considered to indicate greater BCM. Contrarily, vectors on the right side of the graph are classified as indicating lower BCM.\nIdentify the number of standard deviations between the plotted and the mean value of the reference group.\n\tNOTE: Vectors that fall below the 75% tolerance ellipses of the lower pole (major axis) and outside the 75% ellipses on the left side (minor axis) are interpreted as indicating congestion status with a decrease in BCM (less soft tissue), while vectors that fall on the right side (minor axis) are interpreted as indicating congestion status with an increase in BCM (more soft tissue).\nOn the other hand, vectors that fall over the 75% tolerance ellipses of the lower pole (major axis) and outside the 75% ellipses on the left side (minor axis) are interpreted as indicating non-congestion status with a decrease in BCM (less soft tissue), while vectors that fall on the right side (minor axis) are interpreted as indicating non-congestion status with an increase in BCM (more soft tissue).\n5. Directly calculating and interpreting PhA\nNOTE: Raw R50 and Xc50 values are needed to calculate PhA.\nSubstitute the raw R50 and Xc50 values into the formula.\n\tNOTE: Formula in RStudio: atan(Xc50/R50)*(180°/π); formula in Microsoft Excel: =ATAN(Xc50/R50)*(180°/PI). The results are expressed in degrees.",
    "The PhA usually ranges between 5° and 7°; however, values above 9.5° can be reached in healthy athletes. If the PhA values are lower than 4.8° at admission, the subject has an HR of 2.7 (95%CI 1.08-7.1, p = 0.03)39 for presenting a 90-day event (mortality or re-hospitalization) and an HR of 2.67 for mortality in the next 24 months (95%CI 1.21-5.89, p = 0.01)20.\nSubscription Required.
