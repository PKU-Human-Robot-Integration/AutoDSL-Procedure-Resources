    "This protocol follows the ethical standards of the national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration. This protocol is approved by Houston Methodist Research Institute.\n1. Patient selection and prior image review\nNOTE: Dynamic CTA imaging should be considered as a follow-up imaging modality in patients with increasing aneurysm size and endoleak after stent-graft implantation, persistent endoleak after interventions, or in patients with increasing aneurysms sac size without demonstrable endoleak. Like conventional CT imaging, this technique involves iodinated contrast injection that may be relatively contraindicated in patients with severe renal failure.\nBefore starting the actual scan, review the prior imaging studies for the presence of endoleak and stent-graft type.\n\t​NOTE: This can provide information to decide the scan range and temporal distribution during the image acquisition. The most commonly available imaging is the conventional CTA scans with bi-(non-contrast scan and arterial scan) or triple-phase (non-contrast scan, arterial scan, and delayed scan).\n2. d-CTA Image acquisition\nPosition the patient in a supine position on the CT scanner table.\nGain peripheral venous access.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that access is gained by visualizing the venous back bleeding.\nPerform Topogram and Non-Contrast CT Image Acquisition using Sn-100 Tin filter (see Table of Materials) to reduce the radiation exposure and for the region of interest selection in the d-CTA scan.\n\tNOTE: After the non-contrast scan, the location of the endograft will be visible. Place the region of interest just above the endograft.\nPerform timing bolus6 to check the contrast arrival time by placing a region of interest above the stent graft in the abdominal aorta.\n\t\nInject 10-20 mL of the contrast (see Table of Materials) through the peripheral venous access, followed by 50 mL of saline injection at a 3.5-4 mL/min flow rate. Acquire timing bolus scan.",
    "NOTE: Contrast arrival is recorded by the CT scanner (see Table of Materials) based on Hounsfield unit change inside the aorta6.\nBy selecting the DynMulti4D menu point in the pop-up \"Cycle time window\" plan the distribution and the number of scans based on the contrast arrival time from timing bolus and the findings from prior imaging studies.\n\tNOTE: If type I endoleak is suspected, perform more scans on the early phase of the contrast enhancement curve that is given by the timing bolus. If type II endoleak is suspected, perform more scans on the later phase.\n\t\nFor type I endoleak, include more scans during the earlier phase of the time-attenuation curve (scan at every 1.5 s at the beginning and then every 3-4 s).\nFor type II endoleak that appear later, include more scans during the later phase of the time-attenuation curve.\nIf no prior imaging studies are available, distribute the scans equally around the peak of the time-attenuation curve.\nOptimize imaging parameters, including kV, scan range, etc., to reduce radiation exposure. Use settings shown in Table 1 for acquiring a dynamic scan with the CT scanner (see Table of Materials) used in this work.\nInject the contrast for d-CTA acquisition: 70-80 mL of the contrast material, followed by 100 mL of saline injections at a 3.5-4 mL/min flow rate through the peripheral access.\nStart d-CTA image acquisition using the delay time based on the timing bolus describedin step 2.4. Breath-hold is not necessary during acquisition, given that the duration of d-CTA image acquisition ranges from 30-40 s.\nSend acquired, reconstructed images to Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) for qualitative and quantitative review of time-resolved angiographic images. To do this, select the data image and perform a mouse click on the bottom left side of the software.",
    "3. Dynamic-CTA image analysis\nOpen the software (see Table of Materials) for reading the image. Search for the patient's name or identification number to find the acquired images. Select the acquired d-CTA images and process them using the CT dynamic angio workflow.\n\tNOTE: The layout is shown in Figure 1.\nMinimize respiratory motion artifacts between d-CTA images by selecting the dedicated software's Align Body motion correction menu item (Figure 1).\nQualitative analysis: Check axial slices of CT images when maximum opacification of the aorta occurs to interpret any obvious endoleak.\n\t\nThen analyze scans in multiplanar reconstruction mode; if endoleak is suspected, focus on the endoleak and use the timescale shown in Figure 1 to watch time-resolved images and infer the source of endoleak.\nQuantitative analysis: Click on the Time Attenuation Curve (TAC) function shown in Figure 1. Select a region above the stent-graft (ROIaorta) and draw a circle using the TAC function, then select the endoleak (ROIendoleak) region and draw a circle there as well.\n\tNOTE: Target vessels can be selected (ROItarget) to determine the role of the vessel to the endoleak (inflow or outflow).\n\t\nAnalyze the acquired TAC (Figure 2) to determine the endoleak characteristics. Subtract the time to the peak value of the endoleak from the aortic ROI curves to get the Δ time to peak value. This value can be used for endoleak analysis6.\nAfter qualitative and quantitative analysis, infer the type and source of endoleak.",
    "​NOTE: Type I endoleaks appear as parallel contrast enhancement next to the graft, usually because of the inadequate sealing zone and have a shorter time difference between the aortic and endoleak enhancement curves (Δ time to peak value) between aortic and endoleak ROI. Type II endoleaks are related to an inflow vessel with retrograde filling through collateral and have prolonged Δ time to peak value between aortic and endoleak ROI. Based on experience, a Δ time-to-peak value of higher than 4 s was not recorded for type I endoleaks.\n4. Intra-operative image fusion guidance\nPosition the patient supine on the hybrid operating room (OR) table.\nLoad the selected dynamic CTA scan that has the best visibility of the endoleak in the hybrid OR workstation. Manually annotate critical landmarks on the scan: renal arteries ostia, internal iliac arteries ostia, endoleak cavity, lumbar artery(ies), or inferior mesenteric artery.\nSelect 2D-3D image fusion in the workstation and acquire an anteroposterior and an oblique fluoroscopic image of the patient using the 2D-3D image fusion workflow. For this, move the C-arm to the required angle(s) with the joystick on the operating table and step on the CINE acquisition pedal.\nElectronically align the stent graft with markers from the 3D dynamic CTA scan with the fluoroscopic images using automated image registration, followed by manual refinement if necessary (Figure 3) in the 3D post-processing workstation (Drag one image for manual alignment). Check and accept the 2D-3D Image Fusion and Overlay the markers from d-CTA on the real-time 2D fluoroscopic image (Figure 4).\nPerform the endoleak embolization using the overlaid markers from d-CTA as guidance.\nSubscription Required.
