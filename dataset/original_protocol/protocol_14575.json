    "Experiments were carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health for the care and use of animals in research and were approved by the Swedish Medical Center Animal Care and Use Committee. All procedures were performed with appropriate aseptic techniques. Experimental animals utilized for the study were male, 3 months old, wild type C57 mice with body weight from 25 to 27 g.\n1. In Vivo Stroke Induction\nPre-coat the Filament with Dental Resin Prior to the Surgery.\n\t\nCut a 12 mm long piece of filament from a 7-0 nylon suture. Mix 2 parts of the resin with 1 part of the hardener, and then immediately dip the tip of the filament into the mixture to cover about 1/3 of the entire length. Remove it quickly and verify that it is covered with a smooth-surfaced coat of dental resin.\nAir dry the filament for 2 hr before use.\nPlace the mouse into an anesthesia induction chamber (2 L volume), and set the flow of 1.5% isoflurane in 25% oxygen-enriched room air at 2 L/min going into the chamber.\nAllow the mouse to remain in the induction chamber until fully anesthetized,8 as determined by lack of response to tail pinch.\nPlace the mouse onto the operating table with a heated pad, and set the isoflurane concentration on 1% for maintenance of anesthesia delivered spontaneously through the nose cone.\nClip hair on the front and the back of the neck, and spray the neck with rubbing alcohol. Apply veterinary ophthalmic ointment on both eyes.\nTo continuously monitor body temperature, use a rectal temperature probe connected to digital display during the surgery.",
    "Place the mouse in the supine position, apply povidone-iodine 10% scrub solution for disinfection, cover with a sterile drape, and then make a midline incision along the neck with a size 10 surgical scalpel blade.\nTemporarily ligate the left common carotid artery (CCA) with 6.0 silk suture.\nPlace another tie on the left external carotid artery (ECA).\nPlace a microvascular clip on the internal carotid artery (ICA).\nCut a small hole on the external carotid artery with microvascular scissors. Insert a filament made from 7-0 nylon suture coated with dental resin into the opening in the ECA, and advance it cephalically, while removing the clip, until resistance is felt (about 5-7 mm from the bifurcation point of the CCA).\nPlace a temporary tie onto the internal carotid artery to secure the filament in position. Refer to the diagram, Figure 1A. Close the skin with silk suture, and infiltrate the wound on the front of the neck with 0.2 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine, as in the step 2.6.\nAllow the mouse to awaken from anesthesia and regain consciousness in a recovery chamber for 60 min. Do not leave the animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbence.\nTest the mouse for neurological deficit scoring (NDS) as follows: 0 = normal motor function, 1 = flexion of torso and of contralateral forelimb on tail lift, 2 = circling to the contralateral side but normal posture at rest, 3 = leaning to contralateral side at rest, 4 = no spontaneous motor activity.4,9\nFor the NDS testing, lift mouse by the tail and place on a flat surface for observation (2-3 min). Alternatively, observe mice in the recovery chamber. Exclude mice that exhibit NDS lower than 2 from the experiment due to insufficient occlusion of the MCA.",
    "​Note: Laser Doppler flowmetry technique can be used to confirm MCA occlusion.9-11\nRe-anesthetize the animal after 60 min of recovery in the induction chamber as described above, re-sterilize the previous skin incision with 10% povidone-iodine scrub solution, and reopen the surgical wound on the front of neck by cutting and removing the silk suture.\nTo remove the filament from the ECA perform the following steps:\n\t\nPlace a microvascular clip on the ICA. Untie the suture on the ICA and pull the filament out while holding clip open.\nClose the clip and place a tie onto the ECA proximally to the cut.\nRemove the clip and remove the ligature from the CCA to restore blood flow to the brain. Refer to the diagram, Figure 1B.\n2. Installation of IV Catheter into the Jugular Vein for Continuous 48 hr Treatment\nNote: Proceed to installation of the catheter immediately after the step 1.16.3 without awakening of the mouse.\nUse two different sizes of flexible tubing: insert the inner tubing (0.94 mm outside diameter; to contain the drug being infused) into the outer tubing (3.18 mm outside diameter; for protection of the inner tubing).\nPlace the mouse in the prone position, apply 10% povidone-iodine scrub solution for disinfection, and make a 1 cm incision on the back of the neck with a size 10 surgical scalpel blade. Turn the mouse into the supine position, re-sterilize the front of the neck with 10% povidone-iodine scrub solution, and reopen the surgical wound on the front of the neck. Tunnel the tubing under the skin from the incision made on the back to the front of the neck, and exteriorize it from the open wound 1 cm.",
    "Remove subcutaneous adipose tissue from the left side of the front of the neck about 1 cm laterally from the midline. Locate the left jugular vein, place two ties along the vein 5 mm apart, and slightly stretch the vein. Make a small hole on the jugular vein between the two ties with microvascular scissors; insert the tip of the inner tubing 5 mm deep caudally (towards the heart).\nSecure the tubing with both ties to the jugular vein. Close the skin on the front of the neck with a 3-0 silk suture. Refer to the diagram, Figure 1C.\nSecure the tubing to the skin on the back of the neck with a suture, and connect the tubing to a microinfusion IV pump through a swivel. The swivel allows free movement of mice inside the cage with full access to the food and water.\nInfiltrate the skin incisions on the front and the back of the neck with 0.2 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine to prevent post-operative pain.\n\tNote: Depending on institutional specific animal protocols, animals may be treated with opioids, NSAIDs, or antibiotics pre- and post-operatively. However, mentioned treatments may alter results of ischemic stroke outcome (see Discussion Section).11-14\nAllow the animal to awaken in the recovery chamber, and then house the animal in a separate cage until the end point of the experiment. Do not leave the animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbence.\nSet the infusion rate for continuous 48 hr IV treatment of conivaptan (0.14 mg/ml in 5% dextrose) or vehicle at 1.5 ml/kg/hr,4 and start the infusion.\n\tNote: The total amount of IV infused conivaptan should be approximately 0.2 mg/mouse/day in a total volume of 1.44 ml.",
    "​Note: Perform Intraperitoneal (IP) injection of conivaptan twice daily with total amount of 0.2 mg in 1.44 ml of 5% dextrose. Implement IP injection was as previously described.15 Restrain mice by gripping the skin of the posterior surface of the body and the tail. Inject conivaptan or vehicle into the left lower quadrant of the abdomen using a 26 G/1/2 inch needle.15\nObserve the animals twice a day for the entire duration of the experiment (48 hr). Allow the animals to have full access to food and water. If the animal exhibits signs of distress or dyspnea consult a veterinarian. If euthanasia is necessary for the animal in severe distress refer to the step 3.1 below, and exclude the animal from the study.\n3. Evaluation of Stroke-evoked Brain Edema at the end Point\nSacrifice the mouse by over-anesthetizing with 5% isoflurane.\nUse a scalpel to make a skin incision over the skull bone along the midline, and retract the skin to expose the entire skull over the brain. Beginning at the foramen magnum, cut the skull bone laterally along the perimeter of the brain on each side, and lift it carefully without touching the brain beneath it. Sever the brain from the spine and the nerves attached on the base of the skull.\nRemove the brain, separate it from the olfactory bulb and the cerebellum, and dissect the cerebrum along the interhemispheric fissure into the ischemic and non-ischemic cerebral hemispheres, as previously described.9\nAssess brain edema by comparing wet-to-dry ratios (WDR) as described previously4,9. Weigh tissues before and after drying for 3 days at 100 °C in an oven. Calculate brain water content (BWC) as % H2O = (1-dry wt. /wet wt.) x 100%.\nSubscription Required.
