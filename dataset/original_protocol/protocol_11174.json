  "procedures": [
    "All of the described animal experiments were approved by the local government agency (Niedersächsisches Landesamt für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit; file number 33.12-42502-04-10/0108) and were performed according to the national and institutional guidelines.\n1. Production of αDEC-205 from the hybridoma cell line NLDC-145\nFor antibody production, thaw cryopreserved NLDC-145 cells producing αDEC-205 at 37 °C in a water bath. Expand the cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Two 75 cm2 bottles will be needed to proceed to antibody production. Cell culture procedures should be performed in a safety cabinet to ensure safe working conditions and prevent contamination of the cultures.\n\t\nResuspend 1 mL of thawed cells (1 x 106 - 5 x 106 cells/mL) in 9 mL of ISF-1 medium supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin (pre-warmed to 37 °C) into a cell culture flask (25 cm2). Place the flask horizontally in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nCulture the cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2, until 70% confluence. This should normally be achieved after 24 - 48 h.\nOnce the cells are 70% confluent, transfer the complete NLDC-145 cell suspension (10 mL) into a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube using a pipette controller with a pipette in a volume range from 1-10 mL. Pellet the cells by centrifugation at 250 x g for 10 min at room temperature.\nPre-warm ISF-1 medium to 37 °C in a water bath and resuspend the pellet in 12 mL of ISF-1 medium supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Transfer the resuspended cell suspension into a fresh cell culture flask (75 cm2).\nCulture and expand the cells in ISF-1 medium supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2, until 70% confluent and 99% viable. This should normally be achieved after 48 - 72 h.",
    "Split the cells to two 75 cm2 flasks. To do this first flush the cell culture flask bottom/culture surface with the cell suspension to remove all NLDC-145 cells from the surface. Transfer 6 mL of the NLDC-145 cell suspension each into one of two fresh 75 cm2 bottles and add pre-warmed ISF-1 medium supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin up to 12 mL.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not renew the cell culture medium as the NLDC-145 cells will have conditioned the medium. Transfer the cells together with their medium and fill the culture up to the desired volume with fresh medium. This is crucial for viability and maximum antibody production by the NLDC-145 cells.\nExpand the cell cultures at 37 °C and 5% CO2, until about 70% confluent which is generally achieved after 48 - 72 h.\nOnce the cells are 70% confluent, transfer 10 mL of the expanded NLDC-145 cell suspension from each of the 75 cm2 bottles into one PETG (polyethylene terephthalate glycol) roller bottle (1,050 cm2). For this, flush the cell culture flask bottom/culture surface with the cell suspension to remove all cells from the surface using a pipette controller and 10 mL pipette.\nAdd 140 mL of ISF-1 medium supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin (pre-warmed to 37 °C) directly out of the medium bottle to each of the NLDC-145 containing roller bottles filling them up to the 150 mL mark.\n\t\t​NOTE: See note in step 1.1.6.\nCulture the roller bottles at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 25 rounds/min for three days.\nAdd 150 mL of ISF-1 medium supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin (pre-warmed to 37 °C) to each of the NLDC-145 containing roller bottles filling them up to the 300 mL mark.",
    "Culture the roller bottles now containing 300 mL culture each at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 25 rounds/min for another three days.\nAdd another 100 mL of ISF-1 medium supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin (pre-warmed to 37 °C) to each of the NLDC-145 containing roller bottles, thereby filling them up to the 400 mL mark.\nCulture the roller bottles now containing 400 mL culture each at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 25 rounds/min for another seven days.\n\t\tNOTE: During this week, the culture gets very dense (up to 95% density) and viability decreases (down to as little as 50%), enabling maximum antibody release.\nFor the purification of αDEC-205 from the culture supernatant pour the NLDC-145 cell suspension (from both roller bottles) directly to 500 mL autoclaved centrifugation bottles.\n\t​NOTE: A total volume of 800 mL of culture should be collected.\n\t\nCentrifuge the culture for 30 min at 8,600 x g and 4 °C to remove cells and debris.\nCollect the supernatants, discarding the pellets and pooling the supernatants in a sterile reagent bottle.\n\t\t​NOTE: Purification of αDEC-205 can be commenced immediately (step 2.) or the supernatant can be stored short-term at 4 °C.\n2. Purification of the αDEC-205 antibody from the NLDC-145 cell supernatant\nNOTE: From the NLDC-145 cell supernatant, αDEC-205 is purified using a protein G Sepharose column (reusable). The column dimensions are 15 mm x 74 mm and 5 mL protein G Sepharose are packed per column.\nFor preparation and washing of the protein G Sepharose column, put an airtight rubber plug on the upper opening of the protein G Sepharose column. Puncture the rubber plug with two sterile cannulas (20 G x 1 1/2\", 0.90 x 40 mm).",
    "Connect a 10 mL syringe to one of the two cannulas and a flexible silicon tube (approximately 100 cm long, 2.5 - 3 mm diameter) with a tubing connector to the second cannula.\n\t\t​NOTE: The syringe/rubber plug construction is reusable and provides a vacuum resulting in a continuous flow of the large volume of culture supernatant to the protein G Sepharose column. To this end, slightly pull back the plunger of the syringe to ensure continuous fluid flow in the following steps.\nWash the column with 50 mL of 0.1 M glacial acetic acid (pH 2) to remove potentially remaining antibody from any previous antibody purification. Put the end of the silicon tube in the 0.1 M glacial acetic acid (pH 2) filled reagent bottle. As a result of the induced vacuum, 50 mL of the 0.1 M glacial acetic acid (pH 2) dropwise run through the protein G Sepharose column.\n\t\t​NOTE: 0.1 M glacial acetic acid (pH 2) should be stored in a reagent bottle or freshly filled in a beaker.\nWash the column with 100-200 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Put the end of the silicon tube into a PBS filled reagent bottle or beaker. Let 100-200 mL PBS run dropwise through the protein G Sepharose column.\nFor antibody purification from the NLDC-145 supernatant, load 800 mL of the NLDC-145 supernatant (obtained from step 1.2.2.) onto the column. Put the end of the silicon tube into the NLDC-145 supernatant filled reagent bottle. Let 800 mL NLDC-145 supernatant run dropwise through the column.\n\t\nWash the column with 500 mL of PBS. Put the end of the silicon tube in a PBS filled reagent bottle or beaker. Let 500 mL PBS run dropwise through the column.",
    "For elution, use 20 1.5 mL tubes and pipette 100 µL of 1.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) into each 1.5 mL tube. Remove the rubber plug from the column and pipette 1 mL of 0.1 M glycine (pH 3) to the upper chamber of the protein G Sepharose column to elute the antibody from the column. Collect the flow-through directly as eluate in one of the prepared 1.5 mL tubes.\nRepeat the elution step (2.2.2.) for all 20 tubes (1.5 mL).\nDetermine the optical density of all elution fractions at 280 nm (OD280) using a spectrophotometer in order to identify the antibody-containing fractions.\n\t\t​NOTE: Use the first elution fraction as blank.\nPool all fractions with an OD280 greater than 0.5 (approximately 10 fractions).\nStore the protein G Sepharose column filled with 20% ethanol at 4 °C.\nDialyze the pooled elutions against 1000 mL PBS (in a 2000 mL beaker) at 4 °C overnight using dialysis tubing with a molecular weight cut off (MWCO) of 12 - 14 kDa.\n\t\nCut the dialysis tubing into pieces of 20 cm. Boil the dialysis tubing in 500-800 mL of 10 mM EDTA (pH 7.5) for 30 min in a beaker using a hot plate to remove contamination. Discard the 10 mM EDTA (pH 7.5) solution and boil the dialysis tubing in deionized water for 10 min.\n\t\t​NOTE: The dialysis tubing can be used directly or stored in 0.01% sodium azide (NaN3)/H2O solution at 4 °C until next usage.\nClose the bottom of the dialysis tubing with an appropriate dialysis tubing closure/single-piece, hinged clamp and carefully pipette the antibody elution into the dialysis tubing. Close the top of the dialysis tubing with a second clamp.",
    "Fix the upper clamp of the dialysis tubing to a floating stand, put it together with a magnetic stir bar into the PBS filled beaker and place the beaker on a magnetic stirrer.\nDialyze overnight stirring at 4 °C.\nTo increase the concentration of αDEC-205, load the complete dialysate to a centrifugal concentrator with 10 kDa MWCO. Open one clamp of the tubing and carefully pipette the complete dialysate out of the dialysis tubing into the centrifugal concentrator (10 kDa MWCO).\n\t​NOTE: Do not touch the concentrator bottom with the pipette tip.\n\t\nCentrifuge for 30 min at 693 x g (2,000 rpm) and 4 °C.\nLoad the centrifugal concentrator with 10 mL of PBS and centrifuge at 693 x g (2,000 rpm) and 4 °C until the final volume of antibody solution left is 1-1.5 mL.\n\t\tNOTE: If necessary, repeat the centrifugation step of 2.4.1. to adjust to the desired amount.\nUsing a spectrophotometer, determine the optical density of the concentrated αDEC-205 solution at 280 nm (OD280). Use PBS as blank.\nCalculate the concentration of αDEC-205 using the following formula:\n\t\t​concentration [mg/mL] = OD280/1.4.\nFilter the αDEC-205 solution using a 0.22 µm syringe filter unit.\n\t\t​NOTE: Purification of αDEC-205 from the NLDC-145 hybridoma cell supernatant can also be achieved by FPLC (fast protein liquid chromatography). Purified αDEC-205 can be stored at 4 °C or at -18 °C for long-term storage.\n3. Chemical conjugation of OVA to αDEC-205",
    "NOTE: A ratio of 0.5 mg OVA protein to 2.5 mg αDEC-205 (1:5) is required for optimal chemical conjugation. However, this ratio can vary for other proteins and antibodies and needs to be optimized for alternative conjugates. Reduction of the disulfide bonds of the OVA protein is performed through incubation with 30 mM TCEP-HCl, which exposes the sulfhydryl-groups for chemical conjugation to αDEC-205 and 240 µl of TCEP-HCl are needed in step 3.2. Both steps, TCEP-induced reduction of OVA (step 3.1.) and sulfo-SMCC activation of αDEC-205 (step 3.2.), should preferably be performed in parallel.\nFreshly prepare a 125 mM TCEP-HCl solution (pH 7.0). Weigh out the desired amount of TCEP-HCl and dissolve the TCEP-HCl in 0.9 M Tris base (pH 8.8). Use pH indicator strips to test the pH of the 125 mM TCEP-HCl solution (which should be neutral) and adjust the pH with Tris base (pH 8.8).\n\t\nPipette 200 µL OVA protein solution (containing 0.5 mg OVA) into a 1.5 mL sterile tube. Add 240 µl 125 mM TCEP-HCl and 560 µL of sterile ultrapure water to the OVA protein using a pipette to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL OVA protein and 30 mM TCEP-HCl (OVA/TCEP-HCl).\n\t\t​NOTE: 2.5 mg EndoGrade OVA (lyophilized) is dissolved in 1 mL PBS resulting in a 2.5 mg/mL OVA solution.\nIncubate the resulting OVA/TCEP-HCl at room temperature for 1.5 h.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not extend this incubation step.\nTo activate αDEC-205 for conjugation, dissolve 2 mg sulfo-SMCC in 100 µL of ultrapure water.\n\t​NOTE: Sulfo-SMCC is susceptible to hydrolysis. Therefore, larger amounts of undissolved sulfo-SMCC should be handled rapidly or available 2 mg aliquots should be used.\n\t\nDilute αDEC-205 in PBS so that 2.5 mg are contained in 900 µL.",
    "Mix 2.5 mg of αDEC-205 (900 µL volume; obtained from step 3.2.1.) and 100 µL of sulfo-SMCC (obtained from step 3.2.) in a 1.5 mL tube, resulting in a total volume of 1 mL.\nIncubate the αDEC-205/sulfo-SMCC solution for 30 min at 37 °C and 550 rpm in a heating block.\nFollowing these incubations, excess sulfo-SMCC and TCEP-HCl are immediately removed from the solutions using desalting columns (MWCO 7 kDa; 5 mL column volume).\n\t\nTwist off the columns (MWCO 7 kDa) bottom closure, loosen the cap and place the column into a 15 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge for 2 min at 1,000 x g at room temperature to remove the liquid.\nPlace the column in a fresh tube and remove the cap. Slowly load the antibody/sulfo-SMCC and the OVA/TCEP-HCl, respectively, to the center of the compact resin bed of one column each.\nCentrifuge for 2 min at 1,000 x g at room temperature.\nDiscard the columns after use. The solutions containing antibody and OVA primed for conjugation are in the tubes.\nImmediately mix both solutions by pipetting for conjugation of αDEC-205 and OVA.\nIncubate the resulting αDEC-205 and OVA mixture overnight at 4°C.\nFollowing conjugation, excess unbound OVA is removed from the solution and the coupled αDEC-205/OVA is concentrated using a centrifugal protein concentrator (MWCO 150 kDa).\n\t\nPre-rinse the centrifugal protein concentrator (MWCO 150 kDa) by pipetting 12 mL of PBS on the column and centrifuging for 2 min at 2,000 x g at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: If necessary, repeat the centrifugation step (3.4.1.) until a volume of about 5 mL has passed through the column.\nBefore loading the αDEC-205/OVA onto the centrifugal protein concentrator, save a 20 µL sample of the un-concentrated αDEC-205/OVA for western blot analysis. Store this aliquot at 4 °C until analysis.",
    "Load the αDEC-205/OVA onto the centrifugal protein concentrator by pipetting.\n\t\t​NOTE: Avoid any contact with the bed of the upper chamber of the centrifugal concentrator.\nFill the concentrator to 15 mL with PBS and centrifuge the concentrator for 5 min at 2,000 x g at room temperature.\nSave a sample of the flow-through (flow-through I) for western blot analysis and discard remaining flow-through.\nFill the concentrator to 10 mL with PBS and centrifuge the concentrator for at least 8 min at 2,000 x g at room temperature.\nSave a sample for the second flow-through (flow-through II) for western blot analysis and discard the remaining flow-through.\nOnce the desired enrichment is achieved (around 1.5 mL of the αDEC-205/OVA solution should be left in the upper chamber) gently aspirate the concentrated sample.\n\t\tNOTE: If too much fluid is left in the upper chamber, centrifugation can be repeated but should be kept as short as possible.\nDetermine the protein concentration of the resulting αDEC-205/OVA using a microvolume spectrophotometer. Use PBS as blank.\nFilter the αDEC-205/OVA using a 0.22 µm syringe filter unit.\n\t​NOTE: For later analysis and in vivo experiments, αDEC-205/OVA can be stored at 4 °C or -18 °C.\n4. Verification of the chemical conjugation by western blot\nNOTE: For verification of successful chemical conjugation, western blot analysis detecting either OVA (4.2) or αDEC-205 (4.10) is performed. Detection of OVA (4.2.) or αDEC-205 (4.10.) should be performed in parallel. An orbital platform shaker should preferably be used for all incubation steps of the western blot membranes to allow uniform distribution of the respective solutions.\nPrepare standard 10% SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) gels for SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis).\nPrepare the samples for SDS-PAGE to detect conjugated and un-conjugated OVA and run gel electrophoresis.",
    "Dilute different amounts of coupled αDEC-205/OVA (e.g., 200, 100 and 50 ng), of pure OVA (e.g., 80, 70, 60, 50, 40 and 30 ng), an aliquot of un-conjugated αDEC-205 (e.g., 100 and 50 ng), a sample of un-concentrated αDEC-205/OVA conjugate from step 3.4.2. (e.g., 125 ng) and an aliquot of flow-through I and II (steps 3.4.5. and 3.4.7., respectively; optional) in 4 x non-reducing SDS sample buffer.\n\t\t​NOTE: Different concentrations of conjugate and protein are loaded to ensure that both free OVA as well the conjugate can be detected on the same blot.\nDenature the samples at 65 °C for 10 min and 550 rpm in a heating block.\nLoad the samples and a protein standard to an SDS gel and run SDS-PAGE.\nPerform standard blotting of the proteins from the SDS gel to a methanol-activated PVDF (polyvinylidene difluoride) membrane (75 min, 125 mA).\nFollowing blotting, put the membrane in an appropriate dish and block the membrane by pipetting 25 mL of 4% meal replacement shake powder/TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20) blocking buffer into the dish containing the membrane.\n\t\nIncubate the membrane in the blocking solution for 60 min at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C.\nDiscard the blocking solution and stain the membrane with the rabbit αOVA primary antibody in 2% meal replacement shake powder/TBS-T antibody buffer (dilution 1:3,000) by pipetting 15 mL of primary antibody solution to the membrane in the dish.\n\t\nIncubate the membrane for 45 min at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C (use the platform shaker).\nDiscard the antibody solution and wash the membrane in the dish (use the platform shaker).\n\t\nAdd 25 mL of TBS-T to the membrane and incubate for 5 min.

Discard the solution.\nAdd 25 mL of TBS-T to the membrane and incubate for 5 min. Discard the solution.\nStain the membrane with the goat αrabbit-IgG-HRPO (horse radish peroxidase) secondary antibody in 2% meal replacement shake powder/TBS-T antibody buffer (dilution 1:2,000) by pipetting 15 mL of secondary antibody solution to the membrane in the dish.\n\t\nIncubate the membrane for 45 min at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C (on the platform shaker).\nWash the membrane again as described in step 4.7.1.- 4.7.4. using the platform shaker. For this membrane, next carry on with step 4.16. (the following steps 4.10.- 4.15. (detection of αDEC-205) can be performed parallel to steps 4.2.- 4.9.).\nPrepare the samples for the detection of αDEC-205 for SDS-PAGE and run the gel electrophoresis.\n\t\nDilute different amounts of αDEC-205/OVA (e.g., 200, 100 and 50 ng), of the un-conjugated αDEC-205 (e.g., 250, 125, 62.5 ng), of pure OVA (e.g., 80 and 70 ng), a sample of un-concentrated αDEC-205/OVA from step 3.4.2. (e.g., 125 ng) and an aliquot of flow-through I and II (steps 3.4.5. and 3.4.7., respectively; optional) in 4 x non-reducing SDS sample buffer.\nDenature the samples at 65 °C for 10 min and 550 rpm in a heating block.\nLoad the samples and a protein standard to an SDS gel and run gel electrophoresis.\nPerform standard blotting of the proteins from the SDS gel to a methanol activated PVDF (polyvinylidene difluoride) membrane (75 min, 125 mA).",
    "Following blotting, put the membrane in an appropriate dish and block the membrane by pipetting 25 mL of 10% blocking buffer (milk powder/TBS-T) into the dish containing the membrane.\n\t​NOTE: The blocking solutions differ between αDEC-205 and OVA detection (step 4.5.).\n\t\nIncubate the membrane in the blocking solution for 60 min at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C (using the platform shaker).\nDiscard the blocking solution and stain the membrane with the goat αrat-IgG(H+L)-HRPO antibody in 5% milk powder/TBS-T antibody buffer (dilution 1:5,000) by pipetting 15 mL of antibody solution to the membrane in the dish.\n\t​NOTE: The antibody buffers differ between αDEC-205 detection and OVA detection (steps 4.6./ 4.8.).\n\t\nIncubate the membrane for 45 min at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C (using the platform shaker).\nWash the membrane thoroughly in the dish as described in steps 4.7.1.- 4.7.4. (use the platform shaker).\nUse an appropriate detection reagent to develop the HRP signal and detect the chemiluminescence in a dark room using x-ray film or via an imaging system.\n5. Verification of the chemical conjugation by ELISA\nPerform ELISA for further verification of successful chemical conjugation resulting in αDEC-205/OVA.\nCoat an appropriate 96-well ELISA plate with 100 µL/well of 3 ng/µL rabbit αOVA antibody in coating buffer (0.1 M sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) pH 9.6 diluted in H2O).\n\t\nIncubate the plate overnight at 4 °C.\nFollowing coating, wash the plate three times with PBS, e.g., using an ELISA washer.\nBlock the plate by pipetting 200 µL of blocking buffer (10% FCS in PBS) in each well of the plate and incubate the plate for 30 min at room temperature.",
