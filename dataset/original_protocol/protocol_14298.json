    "All animals used in the present study were maintained in accordance with guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals from the French Ministry of Agriculture (A-75-06-12).\n1. Animal Exposure to Toxicants\nPrior to performing this protocol, obtain necessary institutional approval and be sure to comply with all animal care guidelines.\nApply the design of the research protocol allowing the constitution of different experimental groups in order to test the impact of the molecule(s) investigated on ameloblast secretion stage and the ameloblast maturation stage. Here, four groups of male Wistar rats were constituted depending on their exposure to fluoride (NaF) in combination or not with BPA (Figure 1A)2. All animals were observed and dissected on day 65 (Figure 1B).\n2. Dissection of Hemi-Mandibles from Adult Rats\nEuthanize rats by CO2 asphyxiation, optionally followed by decapitation to the separate head from the rest of the body. Expose rats to CO2 for 5 min in a dedicated box16.\nRemove all the skin from the lower lips using a #11 scalpel in order to get easy access to the lower incisors.\nWith the same scalpel, make an incision between the two lower incisors with a slight pressure and the mandible will be split into two halves.\nCut the temporal mandibular joint with a scalpel to detach the jaw, and hold the hemi-mandible with fine tweezers.\nCut the surrounding soft tissues with a scalpel and remove all muscles, tendons, and ligaments using a scraper until the bone is completely clean.\n3. Isolation of the Incisor17,18",
    "Carefully shave off the bone by placing the blade parallel to the major longitudinal axis of the incisor. Start at the bony ridge near the tips of the incisor (proximal end) until the end of the incisor near the cervical loop. The incision motion proceeds from the proximal to the distal direction.\nMake a first cut distally to the cervical loop with the scalpel to remove the gonion of the hemi-mandible and permit taking off the incisor easily without damaging the cervical loop or the secretory stage of ameloblasts (red line in the Figure 2).\nMake a second cut below the second molar, and insert the scalpel between the bone and the medial surface of the incisor. When all the basal bone is lifted, rotate outwards the incisor and take it off carefully to avoid enamel organ tissue impair using fine tweezers.\n4. Micro-Dissection of Enamel Organ under Binocular Lens\nDrop 200 µL of Saline Phosphate Buffer (PBS 1X) on the incisor using a pipette. Take the incisor with fine tweezers with the labial surface facing up. Make a scalpel mark between the colorless and the orange parts of the tissue. This mark corresponds to the underlying white spot which is observable afterwards (Figure 2).\nScrape, with an excavator or equivalent tool, the cell surface from the scalpel mark to the apical end corresponding to secretion stage (colorless) ameloblasts, and from the scalpel mark to the tip of the incisor for the maturation stage (orange) ameloblasts.\nRemove the 2-mm tissue corresponding to the transition stage, as earlier described19. Do not open the incisor during enamel organ dissection to avoid contamination by the mesenchyme.\nCut the cervical loop situated immediately at the apical part of the incisor (Figure 2) as previously described20.",
    "Collect it in 10% formalin or lysis solution for further investigations (see Table of Materials).\n5. Collection of Separated Enamel Organ Tissues for Further Investigations\nDrop 200 µL PBS 1X buffer on the incisor.\nWith a #11 scalpel blade, carefully detach the dental epithelial cells gradually in the buffer, separately for each stage with the help of the scalpel mark made previously.\nFor cell RNA and protein extractions, put the tissue in a lysis solution that allows the extraction of both proteins and RNAs (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Prepare high quality RNAs by turning the tissue-excavator in the tube, and then grinding the cells until obtaining a homogeneous mixture. The mixture is ready for RNA and protein extractions according to the manufacturer's procedure, which was previously described2,8,17. Usually, about 5-10 µg total RNAs and 150 µg total proteins were obtained for each preparation.\nFor histological analyses, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and in situ hybridization (ISH), put the cell layer in 10% formalin for 2 h, then store at 4 °C in PBS 1X. The tissue can then be embedded in wax/paraffin or tissue OCT for frozen sections.\nFor EMP extractions, take the incisor with fine tweezers. After a short exposure to air (slight dehydration), a white spot will be visible around the middle part of the labial surface of the incisor, which represents the initiation of the enamel mineralization. This white spot corresponds to the transition-/early maturation-stage of ameloblasts, so use it as an indicator for extraction of EMPs21.\nSubscription Required.
