PB: perfusion buffer, which can be stored for 3 days at 4 °C (300 mL per animal). CB: cannulation buffer, which can be stored for 3 days at 4 °C (200 mL per animal). DB: digestion buffer, which has to be used within the day (40 mL per animal). SB: stopping buffer, which has to be used within the day (2 mL per animal). S1: Step 1 buffer, which has to be used within the day (2 mL per animal). S2: Step 2 buffer, which has to be used within the day (2 mL per animal). S3: Step 3 buffer, which has to be used within the day (2 mL per animal). NT: normal Tyrode, which has to be used within the day (50 mL per animal).\nPrepare the Langendorff apparatus (Figure 2A).\nFlush the system with 100 mL of 70% ethanol, followed by 2 flushes of 100 mL distilled water. Fill the system with 200 mL of perfusion buffer (PB).\nSet the flow rate of the peristaltic pump to 3 mL/min.\nCalibrate the temperature of the PB leaving the Langendorff apparatus to 39 °C.",
    "Place the custom-made cannula [16 G, 25 mm long, sharp tip removed (Figure 3A)] on top of the Langendorff apparatus and start the flow. Turn on the heating module and adjust the value of the heating module to reach the desired temperature of the PB at the tip of the cannula. Once the temperature calibration is completed, move the custom-made cannula to the syringe used for the cannulation (Figure 2B).\nPrepare the pressure control device (Figure 3C) next to the Langendorff system. Mount the butterfly needle onto the tripod clamp and prepare 3 blocking knots.\n\t\tNOTE: Collagenase enzyme activity varies with temperature. A temperature monitoring of the left atrium, as well as a dynamic adjustment thereof, is required later in the procedure.\nSet up the equipment for the organ excision and the cannulation according to Figure 2B. Fill up the beaker, syringe, and Petri dish with an ice-cold cannulation buffer (CB) and prepare the cannulation knots.\nHeparinize the rat with 500 I.U. of heparin per 100 g of the rat's body weight as follows.\nPut 2 mL of 100% isoflurane in an anesthesia induction chamber suitable for rodents. Transfer the 21 week-old ZFS-1 obese rat from the cage to the induction chamber. Allow the rat to enter deep anesthesia, indicated by a deceleration of the breathing to half of its initial frequency.\nRemove the rat from the induction chamber. Inject 500 I.U. of heparin per 100 g of the rat's body weight into the peritoneum using a heparin syringe.\nReturn the rat into its cage and allow for it to wake up.",
    "NOTE: It is not necessary to maintain sterility during step 1.4. Wait 20 min before proceeding to the next step. An incomplete anticoagulation can cause blood clotting, leading to micro-infarctions, which can substantially impact the quality and yield of isolated cardiomyocytes.\n2. Heart Preparation\nPut 2 mL of 100% isoflurane in an anesthesia induction chamber suitable for rodents. Transfer the 21 week-old ZFS-1 obese rat from the cage to the induction chamber. Allow the rat to enter deep anesthesia, indicated by a deceleration of the breathing to half of its initial frequency.\nEuthanize the animal by decapitation using a guillotine suitable for rodents. Fixate the limbs of the rat on a polystyrene foam surface. Lift and remove the skin covering the xiphoid process with surgical scissors. Open the peritoneum below the rib cages on both sides and expose the diaphragm.\nOpen the diaphragm by making an incision along the anterior arc using fine scissors. Cut through the ribs on both sides along the linea mediaclavicularis to the clavicular bone, using surgical scissors, to expose the mediastinum in situ.\nRemove the lungs at the distal ends of the hila with fine scissors. Cut out the thymus to expose the aortic arch.\nPinch the base of the heart using forceps and gently pull down towards the tail of the animal. Cut across the aorta while maintaining a pull on the heart, leaving a 5 mm long segment of the aorta attached to the heart. Quickly transfer the heart into the 50 mL ice-cold CB in the 50 ml beaker (Figure 2B).\n\tNOTE: During steps 2.5–3.3, the heart is effectively in ischemic conditions. Avoid exceeding a total of 3 min for these steps in order not to damage the cardiomyocytes.\n3. Cannulation",
    "Wait approximately 10 s for the heart to cool down and seize contractions. Transfer the heart into a Petri dish containing 50 mL of fresh, ice-cold CB. Carefully remove the fatty tissue surrounding the aorta using forceps and scissors.\nInsert the custom-made cannula (the same as used in step 1.2.3), which is attached to the 10 mL syringe filled with ice-cold CB, 3 mm into the aorta. Fixate the aorta onto the cannula by tying one of the two cannulation knots (Figure 3B) in the indentation proximal to the tip of the cannula.\n\tNOTE: Be careful not to damage the aortic valve by a penetration with the cannula.\nGently flush the aorta with 5 mL of ice-cold CB using the syringe attached to the cannula until no more blood is visible in the coronary arteries. Gently massage the left atrium using forceps and inject the remaining 5 mL of CB, allowing for any excess blood to be removed from the cavity into the Petri dish.\nTie the second cannulation knot (suture: USP 3/0, silk) in the indentation distal to the tip of the cannula. Unmount the cannula with the attached heart from the syringe. Mount the cannula with the attached heart to the Langendorff using an appropriate adapter.\n\tNOTE: This protocol employs elevated pressure in the ventricular cavity during the perfusion at the Langendorff apparatus. The additional cannulation knot is required to maintain this pressure by avoiding any anterograde buffer leakage through the aorta.\n4. Pressure Manipulation and Digestion",
    "Start the peristaltic pump of the Langendorff apparatus to initiate the perfusion of the cardiac tissue with PB. Tie a double overhand knot (suture: USP 3/0, silk) around the base of the heart, excluding the aorta. Repeat this step until an inflation of the right and left atrium, as well as the coronary sinus, is noticed.\nPuncture the atrium with the butterfly needle of the pressure control device (Figure 3D) and allow the atrium to deflate. Manipulate the intraluminal pressure of the atrium by adjusting the elevation of the butterfly hose. Keep the atrium slightly inflated throughout the rest of the procedure; monitor and adjust accordingly.\n\tNOTE: This step needs to be performed swiftly, as a prolonged inflation of the left atrium will result in cardiomyocyte death.\nMeasure the approximate temperature of the left atrium by positioning a temperature probe between the left atrium and the left ventricle. Adjust the temperature of the Langendorff heating module accordingly, targeting an approximate temperature of 37 °C of the left atrium.\nPerfuse the heart with PB for a total of 3 min.\nSwitch the perfusion to a digestion buffer (DB) for approximately 14–18 min.\n\tNOTE: The digestion is complete when the left atrial structure collapses and the tissue acquires a milky texture.\nPinch the atrium using forceps and enact a slight pull. Remove the left atrium using fine scissors and transfer the atrium into a large weighing boat containing 2 mL of stopping buffer (SB), fully submerging the tissue.\nDispose of the remaining cardiac tissue following the guidelines of the laboratory where the procedure is performed.\n5. Cell Processing and Calcium Re-adaptation\nMince the atrial tissue into small pieces of roughly 2 mm x 2 mm using fine scissors.",
    "Disperse the tissue by a gentle suction and ejection of the tissue chunks using a transfer pipette. Continue this procedure for approximately 5 min until a macroscopic dissociation of the tissue can be observed.\n\tNOTE: Avoid any air bubbles during this step, as exposing the cells to air will result in cardiomyocyte death.\nTransfer the cells to a 15 mL conical tube. Allow the tissue chunks to settle for 30 s. Transfer the supernatant into another 15 mL conical tube. Allow the cells to settle for 15 min.\nRemove and discard the supernatant. Add 2 mL of Step 1 buffer (see Table 1). Allow the cardiomyocytes to settle for 10 min.\n\tNOTE: The discarded supernatant also includes fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Please refer to other protocols if it is desired to use these cells for experiments14,23. The pellet will contain mostly atrial cardiomyocytes, which can be confirmed by light microscopy. The microscopic characteristics of atrial cardiomyocytes are discussed in step 6.1.\nRemove and discard the supernatant. Add 2 mL of Step 2 buffer. Allow the cardiomyocytes to settle for 10 min.\nRemove and discard the supernatant. Add 2 mL of Step 3 buffer. Allow the cardiomyocytes to settle for 10 min.\nRemove and discard the supernatant. Add 250 µL of normal Tyrode (NT) containing 1 mM Ca2+.\nTransfer 50 µL of the normal Tyrode containing atrial cardiomyocytes onto a glass-bottom dish, which has been coated with 25% laminin (and allowed to dry beforehand). Allow the cardiomyocytes to settle for 10 min.\nFill a glass-bottom dish with 500 µL of NT containing 1 mM CaCl2.\n6. Functional Evaluation of Excitation-contraction-coupling",
    "Evaluate the cell morphology and viability under a light microscope using a 20X magnification (Figure 4A and 4B). Randomly select approximately 100 cells and classify them as either viable or unviable in order to estimate the viability of the cell isolation procedure.\n\tNOTE: Viable cells are characterized by symmetric sarcomere structure, the absence of membrane blebs, and a rod shape.\nLoad the cells with the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye within 20 min of completing step 5.9.\nAdd 10 µM Fluo4-AM to 500 µL of NT. Remove the supernatant from the glass-bottom dish (from step 5.9). Add the NT containing Fluo4-AM to the glass-bottom dish. Incubate the mixture for 20 min at room temperature. Remove and discard the supernatant. Wash the sample 2x using 500 µL of NT.\nVisualize the Ca2+-excitation with a confocal microscope as follows.\nTransfer the glass-bottom dish to a confocal microscope and visualize the Ca2+-excitation with a confocal microscope (laser intensity at 5.8%, excitation at 488 nm, emission at 515 nm) using a 40X magnification.\nPerfuse the cells with NT heated to 37 °C using an appropriate superfusion device. Alternatively, keep the cells warm using a microscope-mounted heat incubator.\nStimulate the cardiomyocytes in an electrical field with commercially available, microscope-mounted stimulator electrodes at a frequency of 1 Hz and an electrical current of 24 A. Wait for 1 min to allow the cells to reach a steady-state of Ca2+ handling.\nPlace the scan line parallel to the transversal axis, half-way between the nucleus and the edge of a randomly selected, macroscopically contracting cell. Acquire line scan images by repetitive scanning.",
    "Use freely available imaging software to estimate the signal intensity immediately before an electric stimulation (F0) across the entire cell. Plot the signal intensity across the entire cell over the course of 1 stimulation cycle (F). Divide (F) by (F0) to obtain the respective Ca2+ transient.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57953/57953fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Simplified flowchart of the isolation procedure.
