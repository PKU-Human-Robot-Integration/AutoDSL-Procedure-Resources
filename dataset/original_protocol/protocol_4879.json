    "Collect ~8 x 106 cells in a 10 cm dish cells by using 1x trypsin.Rinse the cells with cold 1x PBS and then remove the PBS twice.Add certain amount (i.e., 300-500 μl) of lysis buffer (50 mM imidazole-HCl, pH 6.8) and lyse the cells with sonicator at level 4 output control, 50% duty cycle for 30 sec and pause for 30 sec for 5 cycles.Incubate the cells at -80 °C for at least 4 h for the freeze/thaw cell lysis procedure.Thaw the cells and centrifuge the cells at 16,000 x g at 4 °C for 15 min.Collect the supernatant and measure the protein concentration by BCA protein assay (He, 2011).Add 20-40 μg of protein, then add lysis buffer to raise volume to 50 μl. Add equal volume (50 μl) of 1x assay buffer and then incubate at 37 °C for 2~6 h (Please see the notes).Add equal volume (100 μl) of 1x stop buffer to observe brown color products and centrifuge at 16,000 x g at 4 °C for 10 min.The absorbance of γ-glutamylhydroxamate in the supernatant of samples was measured at 560 nm. The blank was 50 μl lysis buffer + 50 μl 1x assay buffer + 100 μl 1x stop buffer.A serial dilution of 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, 1.5623, 0.781, and 0.391 mM γ-glutamylhydroxamate (100 μl) were added with 100 μl of 1x stop buffer and centrifuge at 16,000 x g at 4 °C for 10 min. The absorbance of γ-glutamylhydroxamate in the supernatant was measured at 560 nm at room temperature as a standard curve (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160924/20160924021956_1230.jpgFigure 2. A representative standard curve. The standard curve is generated by performing a serial dilution of γ-glutamylhydroxamate.",
    "The upper boundary of the standard starts at a known concentration of 25 mM, and this is diluted by half to reach the lower boundary at 0.39 mM. A blank with no standard is included. These concentrations are then input into SoftMaxPro software and the absorbance is read at 560 nm. The readings from known concentrations are determined and a 4 parameter fit is applied. In this way the standard curve is generated within a large working range, unknown samples can be tested, and the absorbance of unknowns can be plotted to determine concentration."
