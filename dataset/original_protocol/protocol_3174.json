General anesthesia\n      will be maintained alongside the DISDIVO procedure using isoflurane.\n    \n        Anesthesia of animals.\n        \n            Measure and record body weight of the animal and calculate amount of\n            ketamine/xylazine at a dose of 90:10 mg/kg required.\n          \n            Administer the ketamine/xylazine through intraperitoneal injection\n            using a 1 mL syringe with a 25-gauge needle. Intraperitoneal\n            administration is injected at the lower left or right quadra of the\n            mice abdomen.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\n            Wait until the animal has reached a surgical plane and no tail pinch\n            response is observed.\n          \nPlace the mouse on its back on a Styrofoam dissecting tray.\n            Pin the four paws of the mouse using pins or needles to accomplish\n            proper immobilization of the anesthetized animal.\n          \n            Connect the anesthesia mask for mice (nose cone) of the isoflurane\n            infuser system to the nose of the animal.\n          \n            Turn on the isoflurane gas to 1.5% v/v isoflurane level at a flow\n            rate of 0.4–0.8 L/min.\n          \nNote: The use of a Styrofoam board\n      positioned in a large stainless steel or autoclavable tray is highly\n      recommended for collection of any possible fluid overflow (see\n      Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\n    \nNote: animal surgical plane is generally\n      accomplished in less than 5 min.\n    \nNote: for animal immobilization, the use\n      of tape for immobilization of paws is not recommended as tape is detached\n      easily if it gets in contact with liquids.\n    \n      Once the animal is fully anesthetized the DISDIVO procedure will start\n      with the perfusion surgery. For the DISDIVO the animal is transcardially\n      perfused with different buffers: i) PBS, for the detachment and collection\n      of eGC;, ii) 0.5% SDC, for the ECs decellularization, lysis and\n      collection; and iii) 10% SDC, for the SMCs decellularization, lysis and\n      collection.\n    \nDISDIVO perfusion\n        Perfusion surgery (see Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A–2F).\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2943-Fig2.jpg",

    "Insert the 30-gauge needle connected to the 1× PBS perfusion line\n            into the left ventricle.\n          \n            Turn on the syringe pump to run 1× PBS at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min.\n          \n            Once perfusion has begun, rapidly create a small incision into the\n            right auricle using fine scissors to allow drainage of perfusates.\n            Alternatively, the collection of perfusates can be assisted by the\n            injection of a 25-gauge needle into the right auricle.\n          \n            Place a 50 mL tube at the side of the open right auricle to collect\n            blood.\n          \n            Change the 50 mL tube after ∼1.5 min of perfusion (almost no traces\n            of blood are visible), maintain the tube containing the collected\n            blood on ice and place a new 50 mL tube for the collection of the\n            eGC in the next step.\n          \nNote: After injecting the needle of the\n      perfusion line into the ventricle, it is important to not move the needle\n      to ensure a proper perfusion.\n    \nNote: During exsanguination whole blood\n      can be collected. Transferring the collected blood into tubes with the\n      interior wall coated with heparin or EDTA anticoagulants is recommended,\n      at the end of the procedure, if plasma will be used for further analysis.\n    \nNote: To reduce residual presence of blood\n      components in subsequent DISDIVO fractions the perfusion with PBS in the\n      exsanguination step performed at 1.5 mL/min can be prolonged, up to 3 min.\n      A higher risk of eGC degradation may be observed when using long\n      exsanguination times.\n    \nNote: blood samples obtained in this step\n      can be stored during the DISDIVO procedure on ice, it is therefore\n      recommended to have a box with ice during the execution of the procedure.\n    \n        eGC detachment and collection (DISDIVO-PBS).\n        \n            increase the flow rate to 2 mL/min to detach the eGC from vessel\n            wall.",
