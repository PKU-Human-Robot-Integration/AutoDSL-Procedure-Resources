    "All procedures involving rodents conformed to Stanford University guidelines, which comply with national and state laws and policies. All animal procedures were approved by Stanford University's Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care.\nNOTE: All solution and buffer compositions are provided in the Table of Materials.\n1. Prepare a Petri Dish for CD11b Immunopanning (Day 0)\nNOTE: Prepare 1 immunopanning dish for every 1 - 2 juvenile rat brains.\nAdd 25 mL of 50 mM Tris pH 9.5 solution to a 15-cm Petri dish.\nAdd goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L chains) to the dish for a final concentration of 6 µg/mL. Swirl plate to evenly distribute.\nIncubate the dish for 1 - 3 h at 37 °C.\nRinse dishes three times with DPBS++ (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with Ca2+ and Mg2+), then replace with a solution of panning buffer containing 1 µg/mL OX42 antibody. Leave the dishes overnight at room temperature on a flat surface.\n2. Tissue Collection (Day 1)\nNOTE: This protocol should take ~3 - 4 h.\nBefore beginning, ensure all solutions are sterile and chilled on ice. Chill all instruments on ice and sterilize with ethanol prior to use.\nFollowing appropriate regulatory procedures, sacrifice a juvenile laboratory rat by carbon dioxide asphyxiation.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, younger animals may be sacrificed with a lethal dose of ketamine/xylazine (100 - 200 µL of 24 mg/mL ketamine, 2.4 mg/mL xylazine). Ketamine/xylazine must be used if animals are less than 14 days of age. If using multiple animals, extract the tissue from one animal and place it into pre-chilled DPBS++ on ice before proceeding to subsequent animals.\nPinch a hindpaw and ensure complete unresponsiveness from the animal before proceeding.\nTranscardially perfuse the animal with 10 - 30 mL of ice-cold perfusion buffer using a 27½-G needle until buffer runs clear.",
    "NOTE: Volume of Perfusion buffer will vary depending on the size/age of the animal.\nImmediately after perfusion remove the head of the animal. Coming in from the spinal cord cut the occipital condyle on each side with dissection scissors, be careful not to damage the brain. After cutting each side carefully, cut up one side along the parietal and frontal bone towards the nasal bone. With forceps carefully pull back the top of the skull, quickly remove the brain (or CNS structures of interest), and place into pre-chilled DPBS++ on ice.\nRepeat for all remaining animals.\n\tNOTE: All proceeding steps should be performed in a laminar flow hood under proper sterile conditions.\n3. Mechanical Dissociation (Day 1)\nAfter all brains have been collected, chop one brain into 1 mm3 chunks in a Petri dish on ice with a cold scalpel blade, and transfer to an ice-cold dounce homogenizer with 5 - 7 mL ice-cold douncing buffer. Dissociate one brain at a time.\nDissociate the tissue using 10 - 20 gentle and incomplete strokes with a loose-fitting dounce homogenizer. Take care not to directly crush the tissue at the bottom of the homogenizer, but instead impel the tissue through the space between the sides of the piston and the homogenizer.\nCarefully remove the piston to prevent introduction of air bubbles. Allow poorly dissociated tissue chunks to settle to the bottom of the homogenizer, and transfer supernatant to a new chilled 50-mL conical tube.\nReplace the removed volume with fresh douncing buffer, and repeat steps 3.2 and 3.3 for a total of 3 - 4 rounds, or until all tissue has been dissociated. Repeat the procedure for each brain.\n4. Myelin Removal (Day 1)\nNOTE: Myelin removal is used for isolation of microglia from animals older than P12.",
    "Measure the volume of the cell suspension in the 50-mL conical tube using a 25 mL pipette, then add ice-cold douncing buffer to adjust the total volume to 33.5 mL.\nAdd 10 mL of myelin separation buffer (MSB) to the cell suspension and mix thoroughly by inverting the tube several times. This will result in a 23% final concentration of MSB in a volume of 43.5 mL.\nCentrifuge cells for 15 min at 500 x g at 4 °C with slow braking.\n\tNOTE: The centrifuge should take approximately 1.5 - 2 min to decelerate. This will generate an upper layer of myelin and dead cell debris, a somewhat murky supernatant, and a smaller pellet that is enriched for live cells.\nRemove the top layer of myelin/debris and the supernatant with a pipette. Take care when removing the top layer to ensure as much of it is removed as possible.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 12 mL of panning buffer. Gently triturate the cell suspension to break up any clumps of cells that might remain.\n5. Immunopanning (Day 1)\nPass the cell suspension through a 70-µm cell strainer to remove large debris or cell clumps.\nRinse the OX42-coated panning dish three times with DPBS++. Don't allow the plate to completely dry between washes.\nPour off the last DPBS++ wash and apply the filtered cell suspension to the panning dish. Gently swirl the plate to distribute the cells, then incubate the plate on a flat surface at room temperature for 20 min to allow cells to adhere. Do not incubate longer than 20 min or cells will become very difficult to recover from the dish.",
    "Rinse the panning dish with DPBS++ 10 times to remove non-adherent cells. Microglia will be firmly attached to the plate, so swirl the plate with each rinse to ensure removal of other non-adherent cells.\nPour off the last DPBS++ wash and replace with 15 mL DPBS++ and 200 μL trypsin (1.25% stock solution).\nIncubate the dish for ≤10 min at 37 °C with 10% CO2 to trypsinize.\n\tNOTE: Do not continue longer than 10 min or microglia will become difficult to remove.\nAfter 10 min of trypsinization, microglia will still be stuck to plate. Pour off trypsin/DPBS++ and gently wash 2x with DPBS++ to remove trypsin, replace with 12 mL of ice-cold microglia growth medium (MGM).\nPlace panning dish on ice for 2 min to help weaken cell/substrate interaction, and make sure the dish is flat to prevent areas of the panning dish from drying out.\nPipette vigorously with a 10-mL pipette and pipet controller on high speed to recover cells from the panning dish. Draw a 16 x 16 grid with the stream of liquid from the pipette to try and remove all the cells.\nCheck cells under a microscope at 20X magnification to make sure cells have detached from plate. Mark spots on top of the dish where cells are still stuck, and repeat pipetting in those areas.\nCollect cell suspension and aliquot 3 - 4 mL of supernatant per 15-mL conical tube. Spin for 15 min at 500 x g at 4 °C with slow braking.\n\tNOTE: Spinning microglia through a small volume allows for the maximum recovery of cells.\nAspirate the supernatant, leaving 0.5 mL of MGM with the cell pellet.\nResuspend each pellet in remaining MGM, and pool the cells from all the tubes.\nCount cells with hemocytometer.",
    "Plate cells as described in Steps 6 - 7 depending on the application.\nCulture cells at 37 °C with 10% CO2.\n\tNOTE: Cells can be culture for up to 3 - 4 weeks with regular media changes or one week with no media changes.\n6. Spot Coating Tissue Culture Plates/Coverslips (Day 1)\nPlate 15 µL of collagen IV coating directly in the center of a 24-well anionic/cationic coated tissue culture plate (see Table of Materials for details) and incubate for 15 min at 37 °C with 10% CO2.\nAfter counting cells with hemocytometer dilute cells to 2.3 x 105/mL in MGM. Aspirate collagen IV spot and immediately plate 15 µL of cell suspension to this spot; this will give 3.5 x 103 cells/spot. Incubate for 5 - 10 min at 37 °C with 10% CO2 to allow cells to adhere, add 500 µL of CO2-equilibrated TGF-β2/IL-34/cholesterol containing growth medium (TIC) gently to the well.\nIf plating on coverslips, first coat sterile glass coverslips with 10 µg/mL ploy-D-lysine (PDL) in H2O for 1 h at RT, wash 3 times with H2O, and let dry in a hood under UV light. Once coverslips are dry, proceed with spot plating on the coverslips as described in Step 6.2.\n7. Plating for RNA/Protein Isolation\nOn day 1, coat the entire area of a 24-well anionic/cationic coated tissue culture plate with collagen IV coating and incubate for 10 min - 1 h at 37 °C with 10% CO2, then remove and immediately plate 3 - 5 x 104 cells/well in CO2 equilibrated TIC media.\nOn day 2, perform a 50% media change for each well the day after preparation. Dead cells tend to cluster in the center of the well, so take media from there.",
    "Perform a 50% media change every 2 - 3 days to maintain the cultures. If media changes introduce an unwanted variable for the cultures, cells can survive for approximately 1 week without any media changes, as opposed to over 3 weeks with regular maintenance.\nSubscription Required.
