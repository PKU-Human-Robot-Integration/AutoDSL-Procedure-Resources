    "Mounting Animals on an Agar PadMelt the 4% agarose solution in a microwave oven.Dispense 300 µl of the agarose solution on a glass microscope slide, flatten the drop immediately by placing another glass slide on the top. After agarose is solidified, gently separate the two glass slides by sliding one against the other. The thickness of agarose is approximately 0.2 mm (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4187/bioprotoc-11-20-4187-g004.jpgFigure 4. Trim the flattened agar pad into an approximately 12 × 12 mm square Place 3 µl of M9 buffer at the center of the agar pad. The M9 buffer is a buffer for collecting/washing worms.Under the stereotype microscope, transfer embryos with a worm pick from a plate to the drop of M9 buffer. Try not to transfer more embryos than necessary (see Note 1).Gently squeeze a thin line of high vacuum grease around the agarose pad. Gently place a coverslip over the drop of liquid. Avoid air bubbles. Vacuum grease prevents the drying of the agarose pad. A completed slide is shown in Figure 5.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4187/bioprotoc-11-20-4187-g005.jpgFigure 5. A completed slide Time-lapse recording of PLM touch neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans embryosSet up microscope parameters. For differential interference contrast (DIC) images, the exposure time to white light is usually 0.2 s with a 10% neutral density filter. The neutral density filter partially blocks the light, and the percentage of the filter represents how much light travels through. For recording the signal of the Ca2+ reporter GCaMP5G, the exposure time for the GFP channel is 0.1 s with a 5% neutral density filter. For recording the signal of the PS reporter MFG-E8::mCherry, the exposure time for the mCherry channel is also 0.1 s with a 5% neutral density filter.Align the DIC light path carefully for optimal DIC effect according to the manufacturer's instruction[href=https://pdf.medicalexpo.com/pdf/ge-healthcare-life-sciences/deltavision-elite-cell-imaging-system/80554-135081.html].",
    "Under the 63× or 100× objectives, find embryos and mark the positions by using the “point marking” and “position visiting” functions of the software. It is recommended not to mark too many embryos at the same time (see Note 2). Carefully choose the embryos that are younger than the 2-fold stage (460 min post the 1st embryonic cell division).Set up the positions for the serial z-section recording. The serial z-section recording is performed from the ventral surfaces and proceeding inwards. The setting of 10-15 z-sections at 0.5 μm/section is sufficient to cover the necessary region.Set up the time-lapse recording parameters. We found no striking Ca2+ or PS signal prior to the 560 min post-1st embryonic cell division. The starting point of time-lapse recording is set at 560 min-post the 1st embryonic cell division, which is 100 min after an embryo reaches the 2-fold stage (Figure 6). Recording of the Caenorhabditis elegans tail, where the touch neurons PLML and PLMR reside, in the strain ZH3052, is set in the 2.5-min interval for the first 2 h of recording and in the 5-min interval for the next 4 h.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4187/bioprotoc-11-20-4187-g006.jpgFigure 6. DIC image of a 2-fold stage Caenorhabditis elegans embryo.  The scale bar is 10 µm.Start recording DIC, GFP, and mCherry images once the embryos reach 560 min post-1st embryonic cell division, which is 100 min post the 2-fold stage.Keep observing the images during the recording process. Adjust the starting focal plane during the interval of recording if any change of focal place takes place. Abort recording if an embryo slows down in motion or stops its development due to photo-damage. Examples of time-lapse images of cytoplasmic Ca2+ and cell surface PS in the necrotic PLML touch neurons are shown in Figure 7.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4187/bioprotoc-11-20-4187-g007.jpgFigure 7.",

The top row shows DIC images depicting morphological changes of the PLML touch neuron undergoing necrosis (marked by arrowhead). The middle row shows cytoplasmic Ca2+ signal in the PLML neuron. The bottom row shows cell surface PS in the PLML neuron. Recording was started at 100 min after the embryo reached the 2-fold stage. The scale bar is 10 µm.
