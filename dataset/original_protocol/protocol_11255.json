    "All procedures involving human participants have been approved by the University of Lethbridge Human Subjects Research Committee and the Thompson Rivers University Research Ethics for Human Subjects Board.\n1. Participants\nAttain informed consent of adults that have normal or corrected-to-normal vision and are of good health with no history of neurological or sensorimotor disorders (unless the aim is to investigate a particular clinical population).\n2. Experimental Setup\nSelect blueberries, donut balls, and orange slices to serve as reaching targets. Measure a subset of ten of each of the targets across their longest axis to determine the mean length of each target.\n\tNOTE: Utilize targets that are uniform in shape and size. The mean size of the blueberry targets was 12.41 ± 0.33 mm, the mean size of the donut ball targets was 28.82 ± 1.67 mm, and the mean size of the orange slice targets was 60.53 ± 0.83 mm.\nDetermine the trial number and order for the experiment. Inform participants that they will be completing a total of 60 reaching trials separated into 4 blocks (2 blocks in the Vision condition and 2 blocks in the No Vision) with each block consisting of 15 reaching trials (5 repetitions for each of the 3 target objects). Inform the participant that for each block the target objects will be presented in a random order as determined by a random number generator. Ensure that the order of block presentation is counterbalanced across participants.\nSeat the participant in a stationary armless chair in a quiet, well-lit room free from distractions. Tell the participant to sit up straight in the chair with both feet resting flat and square on the floor and their hands resting open and palm-down on the tops of their upper thighs.",
    "Adjust the height of a self-standing, height-adjustable pedestal to the seated participant's trunk length so that the top of the pedestal stands midway between the top of the participant's hip and the participant's sternum. Place the pedestal directly in front of the participant's midline.\nTell the participant to extend their dominant hand directly towards the top of the pedestal. Adjust the location of the pedestal so that it is positioned at the participant's midline, but at a distance equivalent to the participant's fully extended arm and hand such that the participant's outstretched middle finger contacts the distal edge of the pedestal. After positioning the pedestal, ask the participant to return their outstretched hand to their lap.\nPosition 1 high speed video camera sagittal to the participant, on the same side as the participant's non-dominant hand at a 1 m distance from the pedestal to record a reach-side view of the participant's dominant hand. Adjust the position and zoom of the camera until the top of the participant's head, the start position of the hand on the upper thigh, and the reaching target on the pedestal are all clearly visible from this camera angle.\nPosition a second video camera 1 m in front of the pedestal to capture a front-on view of the participant. Adjust the position and zoom of the camera until the top of the participant's head, the start position of the hand on the thigh, and the reaching target on the pedestal are all clearly visible from this camera angle.\n\tNOTE: Additional video cameras may be positioned above, below, or in front of the participant and pedestal as desired.",
    "Set each camera to record video at the highest possible resolution at a rate of 60, 120, or 300 frames per second with a shutter speed of 1/250th (or up to 1/1000th if the movement will be performed very quickly) of a second. Set both cameras to store each video file as either an AVI, MP4, or MOV file. Use a strong lamp containing cool LED lights (which generate negligible heat) to illuminate the participant and testing area. Set each camera to focus on the center of the pedestal.\n\tNOTE: At these high frame rates and shutter speeds a strong lamp is needed to illuminate the participant and testing area. This will ensure that the individual video frames are sufficiently illuminated and free of motion artifacts.\nInstruct the participant to begin each reaching trial with their hands open, relaxed, and resting palm down on the dorsum of their upper thighs.\nTell the participant that at the beginning of each trial, the experimenter will place a target object – either a blueberry, a donut ball, or an orange slice – on the pedestal and that the participant is to wait until the experimenter provides a verbal '1, 2, 3, Go' command to reach out with their dominant hand, grasp the target object, and then place the target object in their mouth as if they are going to eat it.",
    "Tell the participant that they should perform the task as naturally as possible but that they do not actually have to eat the target object. Instruct the participant that after placing the target object in the mouth they should then use their non-dominant hand to retrieve the target from their mouth and place it in a disposal container located on the floor adjacent to the participant's non-dominant hand. Instruct the participant to then return both hands to the start position on their upper thighs in preparation for the next trial.\nSelect a blindfold that is not cumbersome but does occlude both foveal and peripheral vision of the target. Provide this blindfold to all participants at the beginning of all No Vision trial blocks and ensure they wear it before the target object is placed on the pedestal.\n\tNOTE: When completing No Vision trial blocks, participants are blindfolded before the first No Vision trial begins. Thus, they are blindfolded before a target object is placed on the pedestal which ensures that the participant does not see which of the possible target objects is placed on the pedestal for any given No Vision trial.\nPress the 'record' button on both video cameras before initiating the experiment and ensure that the position and location of each camera does not change for the duration of the experimental task for a given participant.\n3. Data Collection\nBegin the experiment by quickly tapping the top central surface of the pedestal with your index finger.\n\tNOTE: The moment of contact between your index finger and the pedestal will serve as a time cue that will be visible in all video records.",
    "Place a calibration object of known size, such as a 1 cm3 plastic cube, at the center of the top of the pedestal such that each camera has a fronto-parallel view of one side of the cube. Leave the calibration object on the pedestal for approximately 5 s so that each video camera captures an unobstructed view of it, then remove the calibration object before the first reaching trial.\nInform the participant that the experiment is about to start, ensure that the participant is wearing the blindfold if they are about to complete a No Vision trial block, and ask the participant to verbally confirm if they are ready to begin.\nPlace the first target object on the pedestal and use a \"1, 2, 3, Go\" cue to signal to the participant to perform the reaching trial.\nRepeat step 3.4. until the participant has completed a total of 60 reaching trials. Ensure that the participant only wears the blindfold for the No Vision trial blocks.\nAfter 60 reaching trials are complete, stop recording from the video camera. Answer any final questions that the participant may have and allow them to leave.\n4. Prepare Videos for Frame-by-Frame Video Analysis\nDownload the video files from the video camera to a secure computer that has a video editing software program installed on it.\nOpen the video files in the video editing software program. In the Start Window that opens, click on the New Project button. For the Video Display Format option select Frames. For the Capture Format option select DV. Click OK | Yes.",
    "Click Media Browser tab and navigate to find the video files for your participant. Click and hold one of the video files to drag and drop it in the adjacent Timeline. This will cause the video record to appear in the Program window. Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to progress forward and/or backward through the video record.\nUse the arrow keys on the keyboard to navigate to the video frame that depicts the moment the experimenter taps the top of the pedestal with her index finger. Pause the video record on this frame so that the playhead (on the timeline) is positioned at the exact frame where the experimenter's finger first makes contact with the pedestal.\nUse the trim function in the video editing software to trim (remove) all frames prior to the current frame. To do this, click the Mark In | File | Export | Media options. In the Export Settings window that opens, select H.264 for the format option and Match Source for the preset option.\nClick on the Output Name and browse to find the folder where you would like to save the newly trimmed video record. Provide a new file name for the newly trimmed video record that you are creating, then click the Save button. This will return you to the Export Settings. Click the Export option.\nRepeat steps 4.1-4.6 for all of the video records for each participant to create a newly trimmed video file that corresponds to each of the original video files. Only use the newly trimmed video files for all subsequent frame-by-frame video analyses.",
    "NOTE: In the newly trimmed video files, frame 1 of each video file will depict the same behavioral event (e.g., moment of first contact between the experimenter's finger and the pedestal) and are in essence time-synchronized. This allows for quick and easy switching between different video views of a single behavioral event within a single testing session for a single participant.\nClose and re-open the video editing software. Repeat steps 4.2. and 4.3. Select and drag all of the newly trimmed video records for a single participant into separate timelines in the video editing software for the frame-by-frame video analysis. This will allow you to navigate through the multiple video views for each participant in a time-synchronized manner. To change which video record (e.g., front or side) is displayed in the Program window, simply click and drag the video timeline that contains the preferred video view to the top of the other video timelines.\n\tNOTE: Step 4.8. is conducted using the video editing software and serves to temporarily time-synchronize all of the video views from a single participant.\n5. Frame-by-Frame Video Analysis: Temporal Organization\nFor each reaching trial, describe the temporal organization of the reach-to-grasp movement using the arrow keys on the keyboard to progress through the time-synchronized video records frame-by-frame. Record, in a spreadsheet (Supplemental Table 1), the first frame number for each key behavioral event described in steps 5.1.1-5.1.6, which are also described in Table 1 and illustrated in Figure 1.\n\tNOTE: While all 6 key behavioral events are generally present in every Vision trial, some may not always be present in the No Vision trials.\n\t\nIdentify movement start, which is defined as the first visible lifting of the palm of the hand away from the dorsum of the upper thigh.",
    "Identify collection, which is defined as the formation of a closed hand posture in which the digits maximally flex and close. Generally, collection occurs following movement start and prior to peak aperture.\nIdentify maximum height, which is defined as the maximum height of the most proximal knuckle of the index finger as the hand reaches towards the target object.\nIdentify peak aperture, which is defined as the maximum opening of the hand (as measured between the central tip of the index finger and the central tip of the thumb) that occurs after collection but prior to first contact. Sometimes the digits will re-open after first contact with the target object, in which case, also record the frame number of this second peak aperture.\nIdentify first contact, which is defined as the first point of contact between the hand and the target object.\nIdentify final grasp, which is defined as the moment at which all manipulation of the target object is complete and the participant has a firm hold on the target object.\n6. Frame-by-Frame Video Analysis: Kinematic Calibration Scale\nCreate a calibration scale for each participant that can be used to convert distance measures taken from the video record from pixels to centimeters.\n\t\nDrag and drop the video record of interest into the timeline of the video editing software program as in steps 4.2. and 4.3. Move the playhead to the frame that depicts the calibration object and click the Export Frame. In the Export Frame window that opens, enter a name for the still frame image in the Name option box, enter TIFF into the Format option box, and click on the Path option box to browse to the folder that you would like to save the still frame image in.",
    "Open this still frame image file in a photo editing software program. Click Image | Analysis | Set Measurement Scale | Custom to transform the mouse pointer into a ruler tool. Use the ruler tool to click on one side of the 1 cm3 calibration cube, drag the ruler tool to the opposite side of the calibration cube, keeping the line as horizontal as possible, and releasing the click at the opposite side of the cube.\n\t\tNOTE: Once step 6.1.2. is complete the photo editing software program will automatically compute the length of the line that was drawn in pixels and display this value in the Pixel Length option in the opened Measurement Scale window.\nIn the Measurement Scale window, enter 10 into the Logical Length option box and millimeters into the Logical Units option box. Click the Save Preset. In the Measurement Scale Preset window, enter the video view and code/number of the relevant participant (e.g., SideView-Participant1) into the Preset Name option box and then click OK.\nClick OK in the Measurement Scale window.\n\t\tNOTE: Repeat steps 6.1.1 to 6.1.4. for each video view for each participant.\n7. Frame-by-Frame Video Analysis: Kinematic Structure\nFor each reaching trial, describe the kinematic structure of the reach-to-grasp movement using the ruler tool in the photo editing software program to record the relevant distance measures described in steps 7.4-7.9 and Table 1.\nUse the video editing software to export a still frame image (step 6.1.1.) that depicts each of the following behavioral events: collection, maximum height, peak aperture, first contact, and final grasp (for each trial).",
    "Open the still frame image that depicts the key behavioral event of interest in the photo editing software. Click Image | Analysis | Set Measurement Scale and select the preset calibration scale that corresponds to the video view and participant depicted in the image that you wish to take a distance measurement from (e.g., SideView-Participant1).\n\tNOTE: Selecting the appropriate preset calibration scale will ensure that all subsequent distances measured with the ruler tool will be accurately converted from pixels into millimeters. The preset calibration scale will remain automatically selected for all subsequent image files that are opened. Thus, there is no need to repeat step 7.3. until you switch to analyzing still frame images from a different video view or a different participant.\nOpen the still frame image that depicts the key behavioral event of collection in the photo editing software. Select the ruler tool and use it to draw a straight line between the central tip of the thumb and the central tip of the index finger.\nClick Image | Analysis | Record Measurements, which will cause the Measurement Log to open. Record the Length of this line as the collection distance in the spreadsheet (Supplemental Table 1).\nOpen the still frame image that depicts maximum height in the photo editing software. Use the ruler tool to measure the vertical distance between the top of the pedestal and the top of the participant's index knuckle. Record the Length of this line as the maximum height distance in the spreadsheet.",
    "Open the still frame image that depicts peak aperture in the photo editing software. Use the ruler tool to measure the distance between the central tip of the thumb and the central tip of the index finger. Record the Length of this line as the peak aperture distance in the spreadsheet.\nOpen the still frame image that depicts first contact in the photo editing software. Use the ruler tool to measure the distance between the central tip of the thumb and the central tip of the index finger. Record the Length of this line as the first contact aperture distance in the spreadsheet.\nOpen the still frame image that depicts final grasp in the photo editing software. Use the ruler tool to measure the distance between the central tip of the thumb and the central tip of the index finger. Record the Length of this line as the final grasp aperture distance in the spreadsheet.\n8. Frame-by-Frame Video Analysis: Topographical Measures\nWhile performing the above frame-by-frame video analysis, also document additional topographical features of the reach-to-grasp movement such as part of hand to make first contact, contact points, grasp points, adjustments, grip type, and grasp strategy (Table 2).\n\t\nDocument, in the spreadsheet, which part of the hand is used to make first contact with the target for each trial, for each participant. Use the following notation: 1 = thumb, 2 = index finger, 3 = middle finger, 4 = ring finger, 5 = pinky, 6 = palm, 7 = dorsum of the hand.",
    "Determine first contact points by exporting a still frame image of the target, opening it in the photo editing software, and using the program's paintbrush tool to mark the location on the target at which first contact between the hand and the target was made for each trial. Adjust the size, opacity, and color of the paintbrush tool to suit your needs. Repeat this step until you have created a single topographical map that indicates the location of first contact points on the target for each participant.\n\t\tNOTE: For an example of aggregated first contact points across all of the participants in a single study, see Representative Results below.\nDetermine the grasp points by exporting a still frame image of the target, opening it in the photo editing software, and using the program's paintbrush tool to mark the location on the target at which the hand contacts the target at the time of final grasp for each trial. Adjust the size, opacity, and color of the paintbrush tool to suit your needs. Repeat this step until you have created a single topographical map that indicates the location of grasp points on the target for each participant.\n\t\tNOTE: For an example of aggregated grasp points across all of the participants in a single study, see Representative Results below.\n\t\t\nVisually determine the average grasp contact locations for the thumb and the opposing digit on the target for sighted participants. Denote these two contact locations as the \"baseline grasp contact points\"",
    "Use the paintbrush tool to mark the \"baseline grasp contact points\" on the topographical map that illustrates first contact points for each participant. Then use the ruler tool (see steps 6.1. to 6.1.4. and 7.5.) to measure the 2D linear distance between each first contact point and the respective baseline contact point. Repeat this step for every first contact point for each participant in the vision and the no vision conditions. Calculate the average \"distance to baseline contact point\" for each participant, which will indicate how far, on average, a participant's location of first contact differed from the baseline grasp contact point.\nUse the paintbrush tool to mark the \"baseline contact points\" on the topographical map that illustrates grasp contact points for each participant. Then use the ruler tool (see steps 6.1. and 6.1.4. and 7.5.) to measure the 2D linear distance between each grasp point and the respective baseline contact point. Repeat this step for every grasp point for each participant in the vision and no vision conditions. Calculate the average \"distance to baseline contact point\" for each participant, which will indicate how far, on average a participant's grasp contact points differed from the baseline grasp contact point.\nDetermine the number of adjustments made on each trial by inspecting the video record, noting any instances where the participant released and re-established contact with the target between the frame of first contact and the frame of final grasp. Record the total number of adjustments per trial for every participant in the spreadsheet.",
    "Determine the grip type used to pick up the target for each trial and record it in the spreadsheet: (i) pincer grip: characterized by gripping the target between the pads of the thumb and one other digit of the same hand, (ii) precision grip: characterized by gripping the target between the pads of the thumb and at least two other digits of the same hand, or (iii) power grip: characterized by gripping the target between the palm and the digits of the same hand.\nDetermine the grasp strategy (preshaping, touch-then-grasp, variation 1, variation 2, or variation 3 strategy; see Representative Results below) used for each trial and record it in the spreadsheet.\nSubscription Required.
