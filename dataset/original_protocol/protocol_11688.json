    "Animal care and all experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with German laws governing animal care and approved by the district government of Braunschweig, Lower Saxony, Germany.\nNote: As the experiment is performed in vivo, it is crucial to maintain the highest possible hygiene standards. Whenever possible, work under sterile conditions.\n1. Preparing the Injection/Recording System\nSterilize the tube that connects the micropipette with the syringe. Use the shortest length of tube possible in the experimental set-up between injection pump and electrophysiological recording system.\nClean the guide tubes of the recording system using cleaning wires. Dip them in sterile silicon oil and feed them through the individual guide tubes several times.\nInsert the quartz glass micropipette into one guide tube of the recording system. See Figure 1A.\nAfter fixing the micropipette in the recording system, attach the sterile tube to the metal pin of the micropipette. Take care; although the micropipette is fixed in the system it can easily break when attaching the tube. Use two sterile tweezers to apply equal pressure on pin and tube.\nUse liquid super glue to seal the junction between tube and micropipette. Wait at least 3 hr for the glue to harden before filling the micropipette with liquid.\nInsert microelectrodes (e.g., quartz glass insulated platinum tungsten) into the other positions of the recording system before or after micropipette insertion.\n2. Preparing the Substance\nSterilize 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes for later storage of injection solutions using an autoclave or other reliable procedure.\nWeigh the corresponding substance scopolamine hydrochloride to prepare 5 ml of a 0.1 molar solution. Dissolve in sterile saline (0.9% NaCl).\nUnder sterile conditions in a fume hood, filter the solution using a syringe filter with sufficiently large pore diameter, e.g., 0.2 µm.",
    "Under the fume hood, aliquot the solution into volumes sufficient for a single experiment, e.g., for scopolamine, 500 µl in sterile 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Use dark tubes to protect the substance from light; alternatively, wrap tubes in aluminum foil. For scopolamine, store the solution for up to 14 days at 4 °C.\n3. Daily Preparation of the Injection/Recording System\nNote: When mounted in the recording system, the electrodes and micropipette are stored in an enzyme solution (Tergazyme, 1% solution with deionized water) between recordings. The following steps must be performed before every recording.\nCollect a tube of the substance to be injected. Allow it to reach RT if refrigerated.\nRemove the injection/recording system from the enzyme solution and rinse electrodes and micropipette with deionized water to clean completely of enzyme solution.\nRemove the front cover of the recording system in order to visually check the seal between micropipette and tube.\nApply sterile silicon oil to the guide tube gap (see Figure 1A) and tips of electrodes and micropipette in order to lubricate the system for smooth movement.\nCheck tips of electrodes and micropipette using a microscope to ensure they are intact. Align the electrodes and the micropipette under the microscope so that they extend out of the guide tubes with the same length. Drive them into the guide tubes, stopping as soon as they are no longer visible. This is defined as electrode position zero. Set the depth of the electrodes and micropipette to 0 in the software.\nFill a sterile syringe with sterile saline and insert the needle into the tube, taking care not to pierce the wall of the tube. Drive the micropipette out of the guide tube for visual control of substance flow.",
    "Flush at least 2 ml sterile saline through the tube and micropipette to ensure no air remains in the syringe or in the tube. Do not apply too much pressure to the plunger of the syringe. Ensure the junction between tube and micropipette is sealed. If leakage is visible, re-glue the junction (see step 1.5) and postpone recording.\nFill a new sterile syringe with the solution to be injected and exchange it with the barrel of the saline syringe, i.e., keep the needle of the saline-filled syringe in the tube. Make sure that no air is transferred into the system. This is best achieved by filling the needle hub with saline after removing the saline-filled barrel.\nFlush the system with 250 µl of the solution to be injected, in order to completely remove the saline from the tube.\nUsing the motor control software, retract electrodes and micropipette into the guidetubesto a depth of at least -500 µm.\nLower the guide tube ring (Figure 1A) to the bottom of the guide tubes to maintain their fixed relative position.\nClean the base of the system with ethanol, in particular where it will touch the monkey's recording chamber.\nClose the recording system by replacing the front cover and tightening the screws.\n4. Validation of the Injection System\nNote: Although the company calibrates the system, it is recommended to validate the ejected volumes with the materials used in the experimental set-up (tubes, syringes etc.).\nPrepare the system as described in step 3, keeping electrodes and micropipette extended out of the guide tubes. A depth of at least 7,000 µm is recommended to avoid loss of measurement volume due to adhesion along the outer surface of the micropipette and electrodes.",
    "Place the recording system in the position it will be used in during the experiment and put the syringe into the microinjection pump. Fix the syringe in place using the rubber band and adjustable grip (see Figure 1A). Slide the movable part of the pump until it is firmly in place behind the plunger of the syringe.\nUsing the software-controlled motor unit, eject a volume large enough to be measured precisely, e.g., 1,000 nl. It is preferable to use one single step to eject the total volume in order to avoid effects of capillary action along the micropipette surface. Very low velocities (1 nl/s) can also lead to this effect during the validation procedure.\nCollect the total volume in a container placed under the micropipette, or carefully collect the ejected drop directly from the tip of the micropipette. Estimate the ejected volume using a pipette or by weighing with a precision scale.\nRepeat the procedure several times to confirm measurements.\n5. Acute Recordings\nSet the x-y position of the recording system. This defines the point at which the guide tubes reach the dura mater within the chronically implanted recording chamber. Make sure the guide tubes are retracted completely (guide tube z position 0).\nBring the recording system into position and place the syringe in the microinjection pump. Fix the syringe in place using the rubber band and adjustable grip (see Figure 1A). Slide the movable part of the pump until it is firmly in place behind the plunger of the syringe. If a drop of substance is visible at the tip of the guide tubes, carefully remove it using a sterile cotton bud.\nPrepare the animal for recording according to the laboratory's procedure (see18 for example guidelines).\nSecurely mount the recording system on the recording chamber of the monkey.",
    "Slowly manually lower the guide tubes into the recording chamber until the dura is reached, then drive the electrodes using the motor control software.\nAs it is not possible to measure impedance of the micropipette, first drive with electrodes and check their impedances regularly at different depths. After a penetration of the dura is successfully performed without damaging the electrodes, advance the micropipette.\nDrive the electrodes and the micropipette to the target electrode depth at which the brain area of interest is expected to be found. Slowly advance the electrode until it is close enough to record the activity of a single unit, as evidenced by a good signal-to-noise ratio in the recorded signal. Importantly, position the recording electrode and the micropipette at the same depth to ensure the minimum distance between electrode and micropipette.\n\t\nIf possible, keep the electrodes and micropipette at this depth for the entire recording. However, if the only way to maintain signal quality of the recorded cell is to move the electrodes, then drive the electrodes and the micropipette simultaneously to maintain the distance between them.\n6. Spatial Attention Task\nIn a series of trials, present two moving dot patterns on the screen, one positioned within the receptive field of the recorded neuron and the other outside of it, together with a centrally presented fixation point that the animal has to foveate throughout each trial19,20.",
    "Note: The monkey is trained to respond to a direction change in the cued dot pattern (the target event) while ignoring any direction change in the other dot pattern, and is rewarded with a drop of liquid for every successful completion of a trial19,20. As a sensory control condition, the monkey has to report a luminance change of the fixation point while ignoring both moving dot patterns (see Figure 2 for a more detailed description of the task).\n7. Pharmacological Manipulation While Recording\nNote: While the monkey is performing the task, inject the substance in a block-wise manner. Three consecutive blocks are defined: control, which acts as a baseline; injection, during which a substance is ejected; and recovery, during which the cells targeted by the injection return to baseline.\nDuring an injection block, inject a predefined amount of the substance at regular intervals e.g., 2 nl every minute at a rate of 2 nl/s. For this example, use scopolamine hydrochloride. The injection process is controlled using software which provides various options. For example, use the step function to define injection volume, and press the injection button every minute according to the clock of the recording software.\n\tNote: The exact duration of the injection block is substance and experiment dependent, e.g., for scopolamine use 2 nl injections each minute for 10 min (20 nl in total). It is preferable not to advance the electrodes and micropipette during the injection block.\nNote the time and the trial during which the substance is injected, the depth of the electrodes and micropipette, as well as the amount of ejected substance.",
    "Follow the injection block with a recovery block, in which no substance is injected. The duration of the recovery block is substance specific and needs to be defined in pre-tests. Monitor and maintain the recording quality of the selected single units until the end of the recovery block.\nRepeat the three blocks for as long as the recording quality and motivation of the monkey allow.\n8. Post Recording Procedures\nAfter data recording, retract electrodes and micropipette into the guide tubes and then manually retract the guide tubes. Remove the recording system from the recording chamber of the monkey. Release the syringe from the injection pump and transfer the system to the preparation area for cleaning.\nHandle the animal (including cleaning of the recording chamber18) according to the standard procedures of the laboratory and return it to the housing facility.\nRinse the outside of the guide tubes with hydrogen peroxide (3%) and then with deionized water. Drive electrodes and micropipette out of the guide tubes, rinse with hydrogen peroxide and then deionized water.\nExchange the barrel of the syringe with a barrel of a syringe filled with sterile saline, keeping the needle in the tube. Flush the tube and the micropipette with 1-2 ml of saline. After flushing, remove the barrel and fill it with air. Reinsert the barrel into the needle and dry the tube and the micropipette from the inside by gently pushing air through.\nStore the guide tubes, extended electrodes and micropipette immersed in the enzyme solution to avoid drying as well as to ensure the breakdown of organic material."
