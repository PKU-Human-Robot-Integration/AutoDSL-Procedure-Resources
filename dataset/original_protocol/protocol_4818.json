    "Grow the zearalenone (ZEA) producing F. graminearum (MTCC, 1893) on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) for 7 days at 28 °C and collect the spores in 10 ml of peptone water containing 0.001% Tween 80 with a soft scrape. Determine the number of spores using a hemocytometer and adjust the spore suspension to 1 x 106 per ml.Collect the Ocimum sanctum L. plant and identify its botanical nomenclature, and dry the plant at room temperature under dark condition. Extract the essential oil from dried aerial parts following the technique of European Pharmacopoeia (Council of Europe, 1997). Prepare a stock solution of 0.05% OSEO in DMSO.Note: In the present study, Ocimum sanctum L. was collected from Mysore, Karnataka state, India and identification was done by Botanical Survey of India (Coimbatore, India).Determine the minimum inhibitory (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFC) of OSEO on F. graminearum by micro-well dilution technique in 96-well microtiter plate implementing the methodology of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (2008) and Vieira et al. (2014) with following minor modifications.Add 10 µl of spore suspension (1 x 106 spores per ml) to the different concentrations of OSEO and adjust the total volume to100 µl per well with Sabouraud dextrose broth (SDB).Consider the wells without OSEO as control and incubate the microplates for 3 days at 28 °C in the dark. Observe the minimum concentration of OSEO without detectable fungal growth and determine as minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Spread plate 10 µl from each well on SDA plates and incubate at 28 °C for 3 days.Identify the minimum concentration of OSEO with no detectable fungal growth and determine as the MFC, specifying 99.5% killing of the original inoculum in comparison to nystatin (positive control).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160728/20160728194118_3119.jpgFigure 1.

    "sanctum essential oil (OSEO) on F. graminearum by micro-well dilution method. Fungal growth is observed in control (OSEO untreated) and no detectable growth is observed at MFC value of OSEO.Analyse the effect of OSEO on spore germination of F. graminearum by the method of Rana et al. (1997) with minor modifications.Inoculate 10 µl of fungal spore suspension (1 x 106 spores per ml) on SDA slides containing different concentrations of OSEO (100-1,800 µg/ml) and incubate at 28 °C for 24 h. Consider SDA slide alone with fungal spores and without OSEO as control. Following the incubation period, stain each slide with lactophenol-cotton blue (100 µl) by dropping method at 28 °C for 15 min and observe for germ tubes under microscope. Examine at least 200 spores from each slide and calculate the percentage of spore germination using the formula,% Spore germination = ST/SC x 100Where, SC is number of spores germinated in control and ST is number of spores germinated in test.Determine the effect of OSEO on mycelial and spore structure of F. graminearum by scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation according to the method of Yamamoto-Ribeiro et al. (2013) with minor modifications.Collect the mycelia disk of 1 cm2 from a seven-day culture of F. graminearum and inoculate aseptically at the middle of SDA dishes that contained different concentrations of OSEO and incubate at 28 °C for 7 days in the dark.Consider the SDA medium without OSEO as control. After the incubation period, collect mycelial disk of 1 cm2 and rinse in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and fix with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5 and dehydrate with gradient ethanol (20, 40, 70, 90 and 100%, keeping the mycelia for a longer duration in 100%).",
    "Paste the sample on dual side glue carbon conductive tape and fix to the surface of aluminum stubs. Further, expose the stubs towards critical-point dry out in CO2 and sputter-coat with gold to increase its conductivity. Observe the morphological quality of mycelia under scanning electron microscope at 20.0 KV in environmental mode.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160728/20160728194502_4999.jpgFigure 2. Determination of the antifungal activity of O. sanctum L. essential oil (OSEO) on F. graminearum by scanning electron microscopic observation (Kalagatur et al., 2015). The control (OSEO untreated) hyphae (a) is smooth, turgid and homogenous. Whereas hyphae treated with MIC (b) and MFC (c) values of OSEO exhibited craters, protuberances and collapsed. The control (OSEO untreated) spores (d) are round and smooth, and on other hand spores treated with MIC (e) and MFC (f) values of OSEO are disrupted and wrinkled.Determine the anti-mycotoxic activity of OSEO in liquid cultures. Add different concentrations of OSEO including, 250, 500, 1,000, 1,500 and 2,000 μg/ml to each 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask that contain 100 ml of SDB. Inoculate 10 μl of fungal suspension (1 x 106 spores/ml) of 7-day-old culture into these flasks under aseptic conditions. Consider the flask without OSEO as control and incubate the flasks under shaking condition (140-160 rpm) at 28 °C for 14 days in the dark.Following the incubation period, separate the culture media from fungal biomass by filtering through Whatman No.1 paper and use the broth for determination of ZEA. Wash the fungal mycelia twice with sterile distilled water and use 10 mg of mycelia for RNA extraction, and pack the leftover mycelia in pre-weighed Whatman no.1 filter paper and dry out at 60 °C for 24 h and determine the mycelial biomass by weighing.Detection and quantification of ZEA by UHPLC by the method of Ibáñez-Vea et al.

    "Blend the culture broth with an equivalent quantity of acetonitrile at 140 rpm under shaker incubator for 30 min. Subsequently, collect the supernatant of the sample by centrifugation at 4226.04 x g for 12 min and transfer 15 ml of the supernatant through an immunoaffinity column of ZEA, which is pre-conditioned under 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Next, Wash the column with 5 ml of PBS and 10 ml of distilled water. Finally, air-dry the column and elute the ZEA with 5 ml of acetonitrile. Maintain contact between acetonitrile and column antibodies at least for 5 min. Dry out the eluate completely over a water bath at 60 °C and redissolved the final residue in 1 ml of acetonitrile and filter through 0.22 µm of syringe filter. Use the filtrate for UHPLC determination and quantification of ZEA.Employ the Nexera UHPLC system attached with the column C18, 5 µm, 250 x 4.6 mm for detection and quantification of ZEA in reverse-phase with a fluorescence detector, and set excitation and emission wavelength at 334 and 450 nm, respectively. The mobile phase is acetonitrile-water (50:50, v/v) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Construct a five-point calibration curve for standard ZEA (100 ng-500 µg/ml) with peak area versus concentration of ZEA. The injection volume is 25 µl for both the standard solution and test sample.
