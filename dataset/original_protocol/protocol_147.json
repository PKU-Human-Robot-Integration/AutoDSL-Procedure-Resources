    "**Brain slice preparation**\n1. Decapitate 4-6 weeks-old C57BL/6J mice.\n  2. Remove brains and cut transversal \\(350 μm thick) hippocampal slices in sucrose-based solution\\(in mM):87 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 7 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 26.2 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 glucose, and 50 sucrose; saturated with 95% CO<sub>2</sub>/5% O<sub>2</sub>, ~300mOsm using Microm HM650V sectioning system.\n  3. Collect the slices and maintain in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid \\(ACSF)\\(in mM):119 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.3 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 26.2 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and 11 glucose: for 30 min at 34°C and then at least 1 hr at 25°C before recording.\n  \n**Whole-cell recording for synaptic and tonic GABA<sub>A</sub>R signaling**\n4. Transfer individual slices to a submersion recording chamber that is continuously perfused with the oxygenated ACSF at 34°C throughout the recording. \n  5. All recordings were made from CA1 pyramidal cells and str. radiatum interneurons visually identified with an infrared differential interference contrast microscope.\n  6. Whole-cell pipettes used in voltage-clamp recordings of tonic GABA<sub>A</sub> current and IPSCs contained \\(in mM): 130 CsCl, 8 NaCl, 10 Cs-HEPES, 2 EGTA, 0.2 MaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 MgATP, 0.3 Na<sub>3</sub>GTP, and 5 QX314Br \\(pH 7.2, osmolarity 295 mOsm) in the presence of NBQX\\(25 µM), CGP52342\\(5 µM), and D-AP5\\(50 µM). \n  7.Whole-cell current-clamp recordings were performed to obtain input-output characteristics of the neurons with pipettes containing \\(in mM): 132.3 K-gluconate, 7.7 KCl, 4 NaCl, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 5 EGTA, 2 MgATP, and 0.5 Na<sub>3</sub>GTP.\n8. Amplify electrical signals with a MultiClamp 700B amplifier \\(Molecular Devices), digitalized at 5 KHz by National Instruments converter board \\(BNC-2110, Molecular Devices), acquired and analyzed by WinWCP software \\(Univ of Strathclyde). \n  9. Analyze Series resistance \\(R<sub>s</sub>), input resistance \\(R<sub>i</sub>), and membrane capacitance \\(c<sub>m</sub>) were monitored throughout the recordings. These parameters were obtained in voltage-clamp mode from the current in response to hyperpolarizing voltage steps \\(V<sub>step</sub>=-5 mV).\n  R<sub>s</sub>=V<sub>step</sub>/I<sub>peak</sub>\nR<sub>m</sub>=V<sub>step</sub>/<sub>Iss</sub>-R<sub>s</sub>\n_c_<sub>m</sub>=τ\\(1/R<sub>s</sub>+1/R<sub>i</sub>)",
    "where, I<sub>peak</sub> is the peak amplitude of the current transient immediately after the step is applied, τ is the decay time constant of the current, and I<sub>ss</sub> is the steady-state current. Analyze data only when the change in series resistance or input resistance is less than 20% during recording. \n**Gramicidin-perforated patch recording**\n8.Perforated patch recording were conducted with pipettes with a resistance 4-6 MΩ and back-filled with an solution containing \\(in mM) 145 KCl, 10 HEPES, 5 ATP-Mg, 0.2 GTP-Na, 2 QX314, and 2 EGTA, adjusted to pH7.2 with KOH.  20µg/ml gramicidin-D\\(Sigma)\n9.The pipettes tips were first filled with the KCl-based solution described for whole-cell recordings to prevent leakage of the antibiotic while approaching the cell. The pipettes were then back-filled with the same solution containing 20 µg/ml gramicidin. \n10. Fresh gramicidin solution was made every 2 hour. \n  11. After the pipette tip contacted the cell membrane, the Rs was monitored. Recordings were started when the R<sub>s</sub> stabilised at 30 to 45 MΩ \\(usually within 15-20 min). \n  12. To get reversal potential of tonic GABA<sub>A</sub> currents, the cells were voltage-clamped at -65 mV. Membrane I-V characteristics were then obtained with 2000-ms voltage steps delivered from  90 mV to  70 mV with 10 mV intervals and from  55 mV to  20 mV with 5-mV intervals. \n  13. I-V characteristics for GABA<sub>A</sub> tonic current were obtained as the difference between membrane I-V characteristics in 5 µM GABA and in 100 µM picrotoxin, added sequentially. \n  \n**Cell-attached experiments for detecting action currents**\n1.Pipettes were filled with superfusion solution and loosely attached to the cell membrane to measure interneuron firing without perturbing intracellular ionic concentrations.",
    "2. Recordings were performed in the voltage-clamp mode. The command potential was set to the potential at which the holding current was 0 pA \\(0-current potential) to avoid direct cell stimulation by the electrode. \n  3.The evoked GABA<sub>A</sub> mediated postsynaptic conductance were triggered by 200-µs current pulses at 50 µA delivered by a tungsten monopolar electrode placed in the str. radiatum. \n4. GABA<sub>A</sub> activation was also produced with a 100-µM GABA puff application \\(100 ms, 50 psi) using Pneumatic picopump."
