    "Select target sequences with E-CRISP (Heigwer et al., 2014)Note: Although several tools have been developed for sgRNA design, our experience is limited to the E-CRISP tool that proved to be very reliable. Select U. maydis as the organism in the E-CRISP webpage (http://www.e-crisp.org/E-CRISP/[href=http://www.e-crisp.org/E-CRISP/]).Click on the ‘Enter target sequence’ box and insert target genomic DNA sequence in FASTA format.Note: Use the coding sequence of the gene you want to inactivate and restrict your search to the most 5´ end of the gene. In case you do not find a suitable sgRNA you can expand the input sequence towards the 3´end.Click on ‘display advanced options’ on the ‘Start application’ panel and make sure the 3’ PAM is NGG.Notes: The E-CRISP tool offers to restrict the search of target sequences to those starting with a G. However, this restriction is not necessary when using our plasmid backbones, because our linearized plasmids retain a G overhang at the 3´ end of the U6 promoter that serves as the first G preferred for initiating transcription at the U6 promoter.The E-CRISP tool gives you the option to design truncated target sequences (Fu et al., 2014). We usually use target sequences of 20 nt but have been successful using target sequences as short as 18 nt. Click on ‘Start sgRNA search’.Select the target sequence with the highest score and most 5’ in the gene. Double check that the target gene(s) correspond to the gene(s) you want to disrupt.Design sgRNA expression cassettes following examples in Table 1 and insert them into pCas9_sgRNA_0 or pMS73 (Figure 1)Note: The CRISPR-Cas9 plasmids developed for genome editing in U. maydis confer ampicillin resistance in E. coli and carboxin resistance in U. maydis. These plasmids contain a U. maydis ARS element for autonomous replication (Tsukuda et al., 1988).",
    "The plasmid backbones also contain the U. maydis U6 promoter just before an Acc65I site that is used for integration of the sgRNA expression cassette via Gibson Assembly® (Figure 1). Expression of the codon-optimized Cas9 is driven by the constitutive otef promoter in pCas9_sgRNA_0 (Figure 1A) or by the stronger hsp70 promoter in pMS73 (Figure 1B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180715/20180715204059_5468.jpgFigure 1. Scheme of the CRISPR-Cas9 plasmids and cloning strategy. A. Schematic representation of pCas9_sgRNA_0 and cloning strategy for the introduction of a single sgRNA. A user-defined targeting fragment can be cloned into the Acc65I-linearized pCas9_sgRNA_0 backbone via Gibson Assembly®. B. Schematic representation of pMS73 and cloning strategy for the introduction of two or more sgRNA expression cassettes. User-defined left and right border cassettes and a variable number of middle cassettes can be cloned into the Acc65I-linearized pMS73 backbone via Gibson Assembly®. The target sequences are used as Gibson overhangs and the number of middle cassettes can be modified depending on the number of target sequences that need to be inserted. ori: Origin of replication, bla: β-lactamase gene that confers resistance to ampicillin in E. coli, ARS: autonomously replicating sequence for replication in U. maydis, ipR: U. maydis ip allele that confers resistance to carboxin. Numbers in yellow boxes indicate different targeting sequences. The scaffold sequence corresponds to the minimal scaffold required for Cas9 binding (Hsu et al., 2013). tRNA promoters used to drive expression of different sgRNAs are indicated by differently colored arrowheads. Cyan line indicates the Gibson overhang to PU6. Green line indicates the Gibson overhang to Potef. Purple line indicates the Gibson overhang to Phsp70.Introduce your target sequences in the appropriate template (Table 1).Purchase the designed sequences as double-stranded DNA fragments.Note: An alternative to purchasing the sgRNA expression cassettes is their generation by PCR amplification from a template.",
    "You can use double-stranded DNA fragments as templates for such a PCR.Table 1. Templates for generating double-stranded DNA fragments containing the target sequences of interestimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180718/20180718232601_8214.jpg*Colors in Table 1 correspond to those in Figure 1.**The scaffold sequence corresponds to the minimal scaffold required for Cas9 binding (Hsu et al., 2013).Note: The sequences labeled as tRNA promoter contain both the DNA sequence of the tRNA ending up in the mature tRNA and 100 bp upstream from the part encoding the mature tRNA. Cloning of the sgRNA expression cassettes into the CRISPR plasmids via Gibson Assembly® (Gibson et al., 2010)Linearize pCas9_sgRNA_0 or pMS73 with Acc65I.Clone the sgRNA expression cassettes into the backbone via Gibson Assembly® according to the manufacturer’s protocol.Note, we have used Gibson Assembly® Master Mix (Instruction Manual, NEB #E2611S/L 10/50 reactions, Version 4.0). Transform part of the Gibson Assembly® reaction into competent E. coli cells according to the manufacturer’s protocol and select for growth on YT plates containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin. Incubate the selection plates overnight at 37 °C. Note: We have used the heat shock E. coli transformation protocol (Bacterial Transformation Workflow–4 Main Steps[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/de/de/home/life-science/cloning/cloning-learning-center/invitrogen-school-of-molecular-biology/molecular-cloning/transformation/bacterial-transformation-workflow.html.]) as given at Thermo Fischer website. Pick some colonies to check for the correct insertion of sgRNA expression cassettes. Use a sterile pipette tip or toothpick to inoculate a single colony into 3 ml of dYT medium with 100 µg/ml ampicillin. Incubate with shaking at 37 °C overnight.Isolate the plasmid DNA from bacterial cultures by using e.g., a QIAprep spin miniprep kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Test for plasmids with inserts by restriction analysis and sequencing.Notes:  For assessing the successful insertion of only one cassette, it is normally sufficient to test plasmids from two transformants or go directly for sequencing.",
    "If more than one cassete is to be inserted, it is usually sufficient to analyze plasmids from six transformants by restriction analysis first and follow candidates up by sequencing. When restriction analyses are performed, enzymes should be chosen which cleave outside the cassette(s) and allow to estimate the number of cassettes inserted.For plasmid sequencing use the U6-Fwd primer oMS59: ATTCGTGATTTACACCAAACACGC and the reverse primer Potef-Rv oMS49: CCCCTCGTCTCGCGCCTCATTGGTCGAATTG for pCas9_sgRNA_0 derived plasmids or oMS59: ATTCGTGATTTACACCAAACACGC and Phsp70-Rv oSR224: CTACACTCAGCACACGATGT for pMS73-derived plasmids.  Transformation of the CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid in U. maydis protoplastsTransform 50 µl of U. maydis protoplasts with no more than 500 ng of the pCas9_sgRNA_0 derived or pMS73 derived plasmids.Plate the transformation mixture on a freshly prepared two-layered RegAgar plate containing 4 µg/ml carboxin in the bottom layer and no carboxin in the top layer and incubate four days at 28 °C until transformants are clearly visible. Notes: Transformation of the CRISPR-Cas9 constructs into U. maydis follows the protocol developed by Schulz et al. (1990).  Note: See Bösch et al. (2016) for a detailed description of the protocol for the generation of protoplasts and the polyethylene glycol (PEG)-mediated transformation.Optional: Transfer single colonies from the transformation plate to 3 ml liquid YEPSL medium containing carboxin (2 µg/ml) to increase CRISPR-Cas9 efficiency.Incubate the culture and shake it at 200 rpm and 28 °C overnight.Dilute the cultures 1:100 into fresh selection medium and allow them to grow until saturation (approximately 20 h). Repeat three times.Note: CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing in U. maydis is very efficient (Schuster et al., 2016). This step is only necessary when three sgRNAs or more are used simultaneously or a chosen sgRNA works inefficiently.",
    "Isolation of colonies with a defined editing eventStreak out 10-12 transformants (in case of single gene disruption), or more (in case of multiple gene disruptions) from the original transformation plate (Step 4b) on PD plates without carboxin, or in the case of incubation in liquid medium (Step 5b), spot 1 µl of cells on a PD plate without carboxin and streak them out .Incubate the plate for two days at 28 °C.Generate a master plate to store colonies to be tested. To do this, pick single colonies with a flat toothpick and transfer to a new PD agar plate. Spread the transferred cells to obtain a larger patch in which cells grow up to form a colony and arrange these using a grid pattern for easier later identification. Incubate overnight at 28 °C (Figure 2).Notes:  This step is of crucial importance because only in the absence of carboxin will the Cas9-containing plasmid be lost. Fungal colonies and cultures grown under selection pressure are heterogeneous populations: a colony (or culture grown with carboxin selection) will contain cells with independent editing events depending on the generation in which editing occurred - except when the CRISPR event took place in the initially transformed cell.At this step, you can confirm the loss of the CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid (see Step 8) by replica-plating the single colonies on a PD-carboxin plate in parallel to generate the master plate and selecting those colonies from the master plate which are unable to grow on the carboxin plate.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180715/20180715210633_3771.jpgFigure 2. Example of a master plate containing colonies to be tested. Generation of a master plate is advisable to facilitate the screening process. Single colonies derived from individual U. maydis transformants were transferred to a new PD plate following a grid pattern and labeled with numbers for identification.",
    "Transfers were made with flat toothpicks, cells were placed in the center of a grid square and slightly spread to increase the area in which cells can grow up and form a colony. A. Master plate before incubation; B. Master plate after incubation overnight at 28 °C.Colony PCR-based screen for CRISPR-Cas9 induced mutationsDesign primers enabling the amplification of a PCR product of about 500 bp containing the target site.With a sterile pipet tip or a toothpick, pick a small amount of a colony from the master plate (Step 6c) and place it in a well of a 96-well plate containing 20 µl of 20 mM NaOH.Shake the plate for 30 min at room temperature at 800 rpm using e.g., a ThermoMixer.Set up a 20 µl PCR reaction using a high fidelity polymerase e.g., Phusion DNA Polymerase or BioMix Red as suggested by the manufacturer. Use 1 µl of the lysed cells as DNA template.Note: In case of multiplexing, a separate PCR for each target site needs to be performed. If you have many colonies and/or sites to test, we recommend using kits like the Plate Seq Kit PCR. In this case, perform the PCR reaction in this step directly in the 96-well-PCR-plate provided in the kit.Amplify the PCR products in a Thermocycler following the polymerase manufacturer’s instructions.Sequence the PCR fragment either after cleanup with e.g., the Wizard SV Gel and PCR cleanup System or e.g., in the Plate Seq Kit from Eurofins.Loss of the CRISPR-Cas9 plasmidIf you have not screened for the loss of the plasmid before (see note after Step 6), pick some cells with a toothpick from the master plate and streak out on a PD plate containing carboxin. Incubate for two days at 28 °C.",
    "Go back to the master plate and use colonies that were unable to grow on the carboxin plate, these have lost the plasmid. Note: We observe retention of the plasmid in colonies on the master plate in about 5% of the cases.Growth on the carboxin plate means that some cells still contain the plasmid. If this is the case and it is this colony that contains the desired mutation, inoculate cells from this strain from the master plate in 3 ml YESPSL medium without carboxin and grow overnight at 28 °C.Take cells from this overnight culture and spread on a PD plate without carboxin to obtain single colonies. Incubate for two days at 28 °C.Replica-plate single colonies on both, a PD plate with carboxin and a PD plate without carboxin, and incubate overnight at 28 °C. Select colonies that have lost the plasmid i.e., are unable to grow on the plate containing carboxin.If necessary, repeat the loss of plasmid procedure until there is no growth on selection plates.Note: Resequence the final clone to verify that you have obtained the desired mutation."
