    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCulturing human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) for differentiation\nTiming: 45 min for passaging, for culturing 5–6 days\nThis step describes how to grow hiPSCs on Matrigel coated 100 mm dishes. One confluent 100 mm dish has approximately 6–8∗106 cells. Prepare minimum three 100 mm dishes for NCC differentiation step (2∗106 cell/mL/well hiPSCs are needed for NCCs differentiation in a 6- well plates.).\nPassaging hiPSCs colonies\nCheck for differentiated areas under an inverted microscope and mark the differentiated regions (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C and 6D.) with a permanent marker\nTake the dish into the sterile hood and scratch and detach the differentiated cell areas using a 1000 μL pipette tip\nRemove old media and differentiated cells from the culture dish using an aspirating system.\nGently and slowly add 12 mL pre-warmed sterile PBS on the side of the dish.\nRemove PBS using aspirator and add 6 mL of pre-warmed gentle cell disassociation reagent (GCDR) and incubate for 7 min at 20°C–25°C.\nDuring the incubation in step e, prepare at least three culture dishes which were previously coated for seeding hiPSCs (prepared at Step 3/b in before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]section), by aspirating the coating medium and adding 11.5 mL pre-warmed TesR_E8 medium.\nRemove the GCDR and add 4 mL pre-warmed TesR_E8 medium.\nGently scrape and detach the colonies with a cell scraper.\nPipette up and down 2 times with a 5 mL serological pipette to break the colonies into smaller pieces\nAdd 0.5 mL TesR_E8 hiPSCs colonies suspension into the culture dishes prepared in Step 1/f\nPut dishes into an incubator (37°C and 5% CO2), and gently shake right to left and backward to forward for a few times\nCritical: Do not open the incubator and the cells for 24 h.\nDaily media change with TesR_E8",
    "Slowly remove the old medium.\nCritical: Do not remove all of the old media. Leave 1–2 mL of the old media to avoid drying out the cells.\nAdd 12 mL pre-warmed fresh TesR_E8\nNote: Media must be changed every day for 5–6 days until iPSC colonies reach 70–80% confluency has compact center (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nNeural crest cell differentiation from hiPSCs\nTiming: 30 min for plating the hiPSCs, 6–7 days for differentiation\nThis step describes how to disassociate hiPSCs colonies to single cells and the differentiation to neural crest cells in Matrigel coated 6-well plates.\nPreparing single hiPSCs suspension.\nRepeat from Step1/a and Step1/b to remove differentiated cells.\nCritical: It is very important to use undifferentiated compact hiPSCs colonies with smooth border. See Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6] in expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes] section for optimal iPSCs colonies.\nAspirate old media and differentiated cells.\nGently and slowly add 12 mL pre-warmed PBS on the side of the dish.\nAspirate the PBS and gently add 6 mL pre-warmed GCDR on the side of the dish.\nIncubate at 20°C–25°C for 10 min.\nDetach the colonies by scraping with a cell scraper.\nTransfer the cell suspension into a 15 mL conical tube.\nWash the dish with 6 mL warm DMEM/F-12 with 15 mM HEPES and complete the cell suspension up to 12 mL into the 15 mL conical tube.\nDisassociate colonies to single cells by pipetting the cell suspension up and down 8–10 times with a 5 mL serological pipette. Take 200–300 μL in a 1.5 mL tube for cell counting and count cells using a hemocytometer or an automated cell counter.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 300 g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.",
    "Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with appropriate amount of STEMdiff™ Neural Crest Differentiation Medium + 10 μM Y27632 to final concentration of 1∗106 cell/mL.\nOptional: The NCCs can be also seeded on coverslips to check negativity of early neuro ectodermal marker PAX6 and positivity of neural crest marker SOX10 by staining.\nCritical: Addition of 10 μM Y27632 is very important for cell survival and to inhibit spontaneous differentiation on the first day of single cell passaging of iPSCs\nAspirate coating media from pre-coated 6-well plates and add 2 mL cell suspension per well (corresponding to 2∗106 cells) in a 6-well plate.\nPut dishes into the incubator (37°C and 5% CO2) and gently shake right to left and backward to forward for a few times\nCritical: Do not touch the incubator and the cells for 24 h.\nDaily media change with STEMdiff™ Neural Crest Differentiation Medium\nCritical: Media must be chadnge every day during 6 days of differentiation (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nSlowly remove the old media.\nCritical: Do not remove all the old media to avoid drying out the cells.\nAdd 2 mL pre-warmed fresh STEMdiff™ Neural Crest Differentiation Medium. Addition of Y-27632 is not needed after the first day of the culture.\nCulturing organoids\nTiming: 1 h for plating, 6 d for culturing\nThis step describes how to passage mouse pancreatic organoids (1:6 ratio) for culturing them until the co-culture day.\nCritical: Timing is important for obtaining ̴4∗104 cell/mL (individual cell number in one 80% confluent well of 24 well plate) organoids on the day of the co-culture. It takes about 6 days to reach 80% confluency in organoid cultures (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\nPassaging Organoids.\nAspirate the old medium from 1 well of 24-well plate.\nAdd 1 mL ice-cold mouse organoid basic medium.",
    "Detach the Matrigel BMM dome by scratching the bottom of well with pipette tip and transfer organoids into a new 15 mL falcon tube.\nNote: Coating pipette tip with BSA by pipetting in 30% sterile BSA solution a few times, prevents the organoid loss due to adhesion on surface of pipette tip.\nFill the tube up to 12 mL with ice-cold mouse organoid basic medium.\nCentrifuge at 200 g and 4°C for 5 min.\nRemove ̴10 mL supernatant to leave ̴1,5 - 2 mL with the pellet.\nPipette up and down 9 times with P-1000 pipette with a 10 μL unfiltered tip attached to a 1000 μL filtered tip.\nFill the tube up to 12 mL with ice-cold mouse organoid basic medium.\nCentrifuge at 200 g and 4°C for 5 min.\nCarefully remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 300 μL Matrigel BMM.\nCritical: Always keep the Matrigel BMM and samples on ice to avoid solidification of Matrigel above 10°C.\nMake 50 μL Matrigel BMM organoid suspension droplets per well in 6 wells of a pre- warmed 24-well plate.\nIncubate at 37°C and 5%CO2 for 10 min.\nAdd 500 μL pre-warmed mouse organoid feeding medium per well.\nCritical: Mouse organoid feeding medium must be warm to avoid dissolving of the Matrigel BMM.\nChange the media with 500 μL pre-warmed mouse organoid feeding medium per well after 3 days.\nCo-culturing neural crest cells and organoids for innervated organoids\nTiming: 30 min for preparing organoids, 15 min for preparing NCCs, 30 min for plating the co-culture\nThis step describes how to disrupt the organoids into smaller fragments, to harvest neural crest cells, to seed NCCs and organoids and the co-culture to form innervated pancreas organoids.",
    "Critical: Cell number ratio between organoids and NCCs is important for the efficiency of neural differentiation and innervation of organoids. A ratio of 5000 cells/mL organoids (individual number of cells that compose organoids) and 10000 cells/mL NCCs was determined as optimal in our settings (24-well plate with 50 μL/well of Matrigel BMM droplet), however this ratio may be changed depending on the features of the used organoids and iPSC lines.\nNote: We advise to count single cell number in one 80% confluent well of organoids from 24 well plate for estimating the cell number of your organoids. (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8])\nPreparing Organoids for co-culture\nAspirate the old media from 1 well of 24-well plate.\nNote: One well of pancreatic organoids from a 24-well plate has ̴4∗104 cell/mL (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]). Therefore, 1 to 8 splitting ratio is recommended to obtain 5,000 cell/mL organoids in co-culture.\nAdd 1 mL ice-cold mouse organoid basic medium.\nDetach the Matrigel BMM dome by scratching with pipette tip and transfer organoids into a new 15 mL falcon tube.\nFill the tube up to 12 mL with ice-cold mouse organoid basic medium.\nCentrifuge at 200 g and 4°C for 5 min.\nRemove ̴10 mL supernatant and leave ̴1.5–2 mL with the pellet.\nPipette up and down 7 times with P-1000 pipette with a 10 μL unfiltered tip attached to a 1000 μL filtered tip.\nCritical: Avoid over disassociation, which decreases organoid viability.\nKeep organoids on ice until NCCs are prepared.\nPreparing NCCs for co-culture\nRemove the old medium.\nSlowly add 2 mL per well pre-warmed PBS on the side of the wells.\nAspirate the PBS and add 1 mL GCDR per well.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 10 min.\nTransfer the cells into a 15 mL conical tube.",
    "Wash the wells with 2 mL mouse organoid basic medium to collect the rest of the cells and transfer into the 15 mL conical tube.\nPipette up and down 5–10 times to completely disassociate clumps to single cells with a 10 mL serological pipette attached on a pipette boy\nTake 500 μL cell suspension into a 1,5 mL tube to count the cells during the next step.\nCentrifuge the 15 mL conical tube filled with cell suspension at 200 g and 4°C for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet with mouse organoid basic medium. The estimated cell number in this tube is 6–8∗106 cell/mL. According to your counting in Step 7/g-i, make serial dilution with of mouse organoid basic medium to a final concentration of 1∗104 cell/mL.\nPreparing NCCs and Organoid Co-culture\nTransfer 8 mL of NCCs suspension which has 1∗104 cell/mL (total 8∗104 cell) into the 15 mL conical tube, which contains organoid fragments prepared at Step 6/h to get final volume 10 mL.\nOptional: The rest of the NCCs should be centrifuged, resuspended in RLT buffer and stored at −80°C for further quantification of neural crest specific genes, such as Snail-2 and SOX10.\nNote: Add 10 μl β-mercaptoethanol per 1 ml RLT buffer for denaturation of RNases. β-mercaptoethanol is very toxic. Mix it in a fume hodd and wear protective clothes.\nCentrifuge at 200 g and 4°C for 5 min.\nCarefully remove as much supernatant as possible.\nResuspend the pellet with 400 μL Matrigel BMM.\nCritical: Always keep Matrigel BMM and samples in ice to avoid solidification of Matrigel above 10°C.\nDrop 50 μL of the Matrigel BMM organoid/NCCs suspension droplets per well in 8 wells of pre-warmed 24-well plate.\nIncubate at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 10 min.",
    "Add 500 μL pre-warmed co-culture media with 10 μM Y27632 per well.\nCritical: Co-culture medium must be warm to avoid dissolving the Matrigel BMM.\nChange medium with 500 μL pre-warmed co-culture media per well after 3 days. Addition of 10 μM Y27632 is not necessary.\nCo-culturing DRG and organoids for innervated organoids\nTiming: 30–40 min for DRG isolation, 30 min for preparing organoids and 30 min for plating co-culture\nThis step describes how to isolate cervical and lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG) from newborn C57BL/6 mouse, to dissociate organoids, and how to seed intact DRG and organoids in Matrigel BMM for generating DRG innervated pancreatic organoids.\nCritical: Mice should ideally be aged between postnatal day 2 and 12. The DRG isolated from older mice have lower efficiency for neural outgrowth.\nNote: We advise to perform this step with two people. One person should prepare organoids while the other one is isolating DRG to minimize the time-dependent loss of cell viability.\nIsolation of DRG from newborn C57BL/6 mouse.\nCritical: Get the approval from national or local ethical committee for animal experiments and handle all procedure according to national ethics guidelines. Be careful to provide aseptic conditions as much as possible by working under a sterile dissection hood (clean bench cabinet with stereo microscope) and cleaning all the tools and surfaces with 70% ethanol. Neurons are very fragile. Be fast during this step and always keep the collected DRG on ice.\nEuthanize the mouse according to approved procedures.\nClean the skin of the mouse with 70% ethanol and open the abdomen (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B).\nTake out all the internal organs (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nCritical: Be careful not to damage intestines because of the risk of bacterial contamination.\nNote: Continue the rest of this step with a stereomicroscope.",
    "Cut the lateral sides of spinal bone at a 45° angle by using micro-scissors and perform anterior laminectomy (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nNote: You can look at our previously published video protocol, which presents how to perform anterior laminectomy and DRG collection: Demir et al. (2014)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2].\nFind DRG located in the intervertebral foramina (between vertebrae) and pick them up and directly transfer into petri dishes containing DRG collection medium on ice (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nRepeat Step 9/g. until you collect enough DRG for your experimental design from the cervical and the lumbar part of the spine.\nNote: A mouse has 16 cervical and 10–12 lumbar DRG. Try to collect as much as DRG you can and use one intact DRG for one 50 μL organoid Matrigel BMM droplet.\nObserve the collected DRG under a stereomicroscope and cut the peripheral and central projections out (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nCritical: Cutting out the projections is very important to avoid contamination by fibroblasts which decrease the rate of neurite outgrowth.\nTransfer the DRG bodies into a new petri dishes, containing mouse organoid basic medium on ice.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1189-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "Note: Preparation of organoids is the same for both the co-culture methods. Preparing organoids from two wells in Step 6 and using them separately for NCCs and DRG co- cultures allows the comparison between innervated organoids co-cultured with NCCs (as neuro-progenitors) and co-cultured with DRG (as adult neurons) at the same time.\nPreparing DRG and Organoid co-culture\nMake one 50 μL drop of Matrigel BMM organoid suspension in the one well of a pre- warmed 24-well plate.\nImmediately take one DRG body and embed it in the droplet with the help of sterile forceps (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nRepeat Step 11/a. and b. one by one for the other wells.\nCritical: Perform these steps one by one and keep Matrigel organoid suspension on ice to avoid solidification of Matrigel.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 10 min.\nAdd 500 μL pre-warmed co-culture media with 10 μM Y-27632 per well.\nCritical: Co-culture media must be warm to avoid dissolving the Matrigel.\nChange media with 500 μL pre-warmed co-culture media per well after 3 days.
