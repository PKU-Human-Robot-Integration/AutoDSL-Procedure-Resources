The selection of GNPs with this size is a comprehensive consideration of particle stability, synthesis repeatability and scattering intensity in the dark field.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4],5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2717-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic diagram of synthesis of gold nanoparticles by the citrate reduction method\nPrepare aqua regia with a ratio 3:1 (v:v) concentrated HCl:HNO3 in the fume hood.\nCritical: Be careful when configuring aqua regia, and take protective measures during operation to prevent it from splashing on the body. It is necessary to wear special acid-resistant gloves, goggles and a lab coat, and try to avoid skin exposure. Meanwhile, aqua regia needs fresh configuration and should not be sealed, otherwise it may cause explosion.\nSoak the conical flask in the fume hood with freshly prepared aqua regia for 30 min, then rinse it with Milli-Q water, and dry for later use.\nAdd 98.9 mL of water and 1 mL of trisodium citrate solution (30 mg/mL) to a clean conical flask on a hotplate.\nAdd the stirrer bar into the conical flask, and turn on the rotate and heating switches of the hotplate (Temperature set at 300°C, speed set at 23 × g).\nWhen the solution starts to boil, add 0.1 mL of 250 mM HAuCl4·4H20, keep the condition above and continue stirring for 7 min.\nCool the above seed solution with ice, and store it at 4°C.",
    "Note: The seed solution can be spherical under transmission electron microscopy (TEM), with a diameter of approximately 13 nm (12–15 nm). Otherwise, it can be simply judged by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. The surface plasmon resonance peak is near 520 nm, and the corresponding absorbance is 1.022.\nUse the seed-growth method to synthesize 40 nm GNPs. Detailed steps are as follows:\nMix together 9.4 mL seed solution, 10 mL water, 0.2 mL NH2OH·HCl (100 mM) and 0.2 mL trisodium citrate (10 mg/mL) in a clean conical flask on a magnetic stirrer.\nAdd the stirrer bar into the conical flask, and turn on the rotate switch of the hotplate (Temperature set at 300°C, speed set at 23 × g, time set 5 min).\nAdd 0.4 mL 1% HAuCl4·4H2O to the solution above and continue stirring for 1 h.\nRepeat step 7 three times to get the final GNPs solution as vector for nanoprobes’ construction.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2717-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Characterization of 40 nm gold nanoparticles\n(A) Surface plasmon resonance peak showed by absorption spectrum.\n(B) Spherical morphology showed by the TEM.\nNote: The seed solution should be spherical under transmission electron microscopy (TEM), with a diameter of approximately 40 nm (38–42 nm). Otherwise, it can be simply judged by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. The surface plasmon resonance peak is near 526 nm, and the corresponding absorbance is 2.272. Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] shows an example of UV-Visible spectra (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) and morphology (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) of the final 40 nm GNPs.\nPause point: The prepared 40 nm GNPs can be stored at 4°C for 4 months. But remember not to freeze, which may lead to the aggregation of GNPs and affect further use.",
    "Note: The single-particle scattering theory proposed that the particle sizes of GNP are positively related to its scattered light intensity; the particles with small sizes are hardly observed in the dark field accordingly. Although GNPs with larger particle size can provide stronger scattering light and better SERS enhancement, they are unstable, especially modified by DNA. The 40 nm nanoparticles meet the reasonable scattering intensity, stability, and SERS enhancement design objectives.\nConstruction of nanoprobes\nTiming: 3 days\nThis step provides the synthesis of nanoprobes, including the screen of target DNA, modification of Raman reporter molecules (DTNB, 4-MBA) on gold nanoparticles and the modification of DNA (Helper DNA, primer DNA) by salt-aging method.\nObtain ITS sequences from the NCBI GenBank and align them to determine the conserved and variable regions of the Diaporthe genus.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2717-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Screening the primer DNA for Diaporthe genus\nThis figure is quoted from Yu et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nNote: The complementary sequence of the screened sequence is designed as primer DNA (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nNote: If the target DNA screened by the two species is significantly different, we can design the capture DNA for them respectively, and use the two kinds of capture DNA for the modification of the nanoprobe at the same time. In this way, when either target DNA of the two species is added to the system, there will be corresponding capture DNA react with it.\nSoak the vials in the fume hood with freshly prepared aqua regia for 30 min, then rinse it with Milli-Q water.\nSoak with 0.1 M NaOH for 30 min and dry for later use.\nNote: It's better soak with NaOH, because GNPs will adhere to the wall during a long incubation in the vials, and soaking with NaOH can well solve this problem.",
    "Modification of Raman reporter molecules (DTNB, 4-MBA) on GNPs.\nAdd DTNB and 4-MBA to 1 mL GNP solution until the final concentration is 250 mM respectively, keep at room temperature for 2 h.\nAdd 100 μL 0.1% SDS and centrifuge the solution (1680 × g, 20 min).\nWash three times to remove excessive reagents.\nRedisperse the precipitate in 1 mL water for DNA modification.\nModify DNA (helper DNA, primer DNA) on GNPs by salt-aging method.\nNote: Salt-aging is chosen because this method of functionalization with nucleic acids has been well established.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\nAdd 1 μL 1 mM TCEP to thiol-modified primer DNA and helper DNA (100 μM) in microcentrifuge tubes for 1 h.\nNote: The purpose of adding TCEP is to reduce disulfide bonds that may be produced during DNA storage.\nAdd Primer 1 and primer 2 to DTNB and MBA modified GNPs respectively, the helper DNA added is in four times the amount of primer DNA.\nPut the vials in a shaker incubate overnight at 37°C, 0.5 × g.\nThe next morning (10 h), add 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and 0.1% SDS to the solution with final concentration of 0.01 M and 0.01%.\nFor the next 10 h, add 2 M NaCl to the above solution at 2-h intervals with a final concentration of 0.2 M, followed by shaking overnight (10 h).\nTransfer the solution into the centrifuge tube. Centrifuge the solution (1680 × g, 20 min).\nWash three times to remove excessive reagents.\nRedispersed the precipitate in 1 mL water for target DNA detection.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2717-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Characterization of nanoprobes\n(A) Zeta potential obtained by dynamic light scattering, showing a decrease in average surface charge.",
    "(B) Average size obtained by dynamic light scattering, showing an increase in hydrodynamic diameter. The error bars represent the standard deviations of experiments in triplicate. This figure is quoted from Yu et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nNote: There is no correspondence between Raman reporter molecules and primer DNA, we just need two Raman reporter molecules and two primer DNA to be connected separately, and you can combine them according to the actual situation. The connection of Raman reporter molecule and DNA can be verified by the corresponding change of zeta-potential (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A) and average size (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nNote: DNA ligation efficiency can be improved by adjusting the frequency and the amount of NaCl added each time. By reducing the amount of NaCl added each time and increasing the total number of times, the efficiency can be improved, but when the total amount is too high, it will cause aggregation.\nOptimizing the amount of primer DNA on gold nanoparticles on GNPs\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step mainly shows the aggregation state induced by different ratio of primer DNA/helper DNA and how to estimate the conjugation number of effective primer DNA on each GNP by FAM modified primer 1 complementary strand.\nCarry out statistical analysis in the dark field under different ratio of primer DNA/ helper DNA (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2717-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Optimization under different ratio of primer DNA/helper DNA\n(A) Statistical results of target-induced aggregation of the plasmonic nanoprobes modified by different ratio of primer DNA/helper DNA.\n(B) Estimation of effective DNA on each GNP with different ratio of primer DNA/ helper DNA. The error bars represent the standard deviations of experiments in triplicate. This figure is quoted from Yu et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nNote: For detailed steps, please refer to dark-field imaging.",
    "Prepare 400 nM, 425 nM, 450 nM, 475 nM and 500 nM FAM-complementary strand solution.\nAdd 200 μL the above solution into a micro cuvette to measure the fluorescence intensity, respectively.\nUse origin 2019 for linear fitting to build fluorescence quantitative curve.\nHybridize the complementary strand labeled by FAM with nanoprobe by annealing treatment.\nCentrifuge the reacted solution (1680 × g, 20 min) and collect the supernatant.\nTake 200 μL supernatant and measure its fluorescence intensity in the Fluoro Spectrophotometer.\nNote: The measure intensity comes from non-hybridized complementary strand in the supernatant.\nCalculate the concentration of the non-hybridized complementary strand to convert concentration of the hybridized complementary strand.\nDefine the amount of primer DNA that can be hybridized on each GNP as hybridization efficiency (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B), the calculation formula is as follows:\nN\nD\nN\nA\n=\nN\nt\no\nt\na\nl\n−\nD\nN\nA\nN\nt\no\nt\na\nl\n−\nG\nN\nP\n=\nC\nD\nN\nA\nC\nG\nN\nP\nNote: In order to generate dimers rather than aggregates as much as possible, it is necessary to ensure that the number of primer DNA on a single GNP. For the 40 nm GNP we used here, the optimal number of primer DNA is about 5. For particles with different shapes and sizes, it should be optimized according to the actual situation. Try to avoid too many and too little. Too many is easy to cause large aggregates, while too little is not easy to form dimers.",
    "Note: Single particle does not produce hot spots, so there is no SERS signal enhancement; Large aggregates are mainly caused by the inevitable repeated washing in the experiment, it means large aggregates represent false positive signals; Plasmonic dimers are the main signal source in the experiment. Therefore, the purpose of optimization is to produce more plasmonic dimers rather than large aggregates.\nPathogen DNA extraction\nTiming: 4 h\nThis step mainly introduces how to extract the DNA of pathogen by improved CTAB method.\nTake fresh hyphae on the flat plate and put them in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube in the clean bench.\nAdd liquid nitrogen and grind them into powder with a grinding rod.\nAdd 600 μL of 2× CTAB solution preheated to 65°C and mix them upside down.\nThen take a water bath at 65°C for 30 min and cool to room temperature.\nAdd 600 μL mixed solution of chloroform and isoamyl alcohol with a ratio of 24: 1 (v/v), shake the solution and centrifuge at 6740 × g for 10 min.\nTake the supernatant into another 1.5 mL tube, add mixed solution of chloroform and isoamyl alcohol (v/v 24:1), mix and centrifuge at 6740 × g for 10 min.\nTake the supernatant into another tube, add 0.6 times the volume of precooled isopropanol, mix it gently.\nKeep at −20°C for 1 h and centrifuge at 6740 × g for 10 min.\nRemove the supernatant and add 70% absolute ethanol to wash twice.\nDry at room temperature, dissolve the precipitated DNA with an appropriate amount of sterile ddH2O\nNote: Generally, the storage time is about 1 month when stored at −20°C.\nExtracting DNA from kiwi fruit\nTiming: 1 h",
    "This step shows in detail how to extract DNA from diseased kiwi fruits by using the Baifeite genomic DNA extraction kit.\nGrind the diseased part of kiwifruit into fine powder in liquid nitrogen, put it into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.\nAdd 1 mL of solution A into the tube, swirl it to make the sample completely dispersed in the solution and take a water bath (65°C, 10 min).\nAdd 300 μL solution B and 200 μL chloroform solution into the centrifuge tube, swirl for 30 s and centrifuge at 12000 × g for 5 min.\nTake the supernatant into another centrifuge tube, add equal volume of solution C, fully mix evenly.\nAdd the mixture to the DNA adsorption column, and centrifuge at 12000 × g for 1 min at room temperature.\nRemove the waste liquid from the collection tube, add 500 μL rinsing liquid and repeat the centrifugal rinsing step.\nPut the DNA adsorption column in an empty collection tube, and centrifuge at room temperature of 12000 × g for 2 min.\nPut the adsorption column in a DNase-free centrifuge tube, add 50 μL of DNA eluent in the middle part of the adsorption membrane.\nKeep at room temperature for 5 min, then centrifuge at 12000 × g for 2 min.\nCollect the solution in the centrifuge tube as the extracted DNA sample.\nNote: Generally, the storage time is about 1 month when stored at −20°C.\nNote: Pathogen DNA and Kiwi fruit DNA are interrupted by ultrasonic cell grinder before SERS detection. The parameters are as follows: ice bath, power 85%, ultrasonic 3 s, interval 6 s, total ultrasonic treatment for 40 min.\nCapture of target DNA\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step mainly introduces the binding operation of nanoprobes and target DNA.",
    "Dilute the two nanoprobes to 100 pM with water.\nNote: The concentration of the nanoprobes can be estimated by comparing with the intensity change of the GNPs in the UV-vis absorption spectroscopy.\nAdd 50 μL of the each diluted two nanoprobes into a 200 μL tube, then add 50 μL of target DNA with different concentration after ultrasonic interruption.\nPlace the tube in the Mini dry bath, after heating to 95°C, keep it for 3 min, then slowly cool down to room temperature.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2717-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Characterization of target DNA capture\n(A) SERS spectra of different concentrations of target.\n(B) TEM images of the nanoprobes with the presence of target DNA. This figure is quoted from Yu et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nNote: SERS results show the concentration response to target DNA (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A). Detailed SERS operation can be referred to Raman sensing performance.\nNote: In order to ensure that the assumption of the whole experiment is correct: the arrival of target DNA will induce nanoprobes to form dimers. TEM morphology characterization is essential, the formation of dimer can be clearly seen (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nDark-field imaging\nTiming: 4 h\nThis step introduces the cleaning steps of the glass slide and the dark field imaging operation in detail.\nFix the nanoprobes on the slide glass for dark field imaging experiment. The detailed steps for cleaning the slide glass are as follows:\nNote: The purpose of cleaning slide glass is to reduce the influence of impurities and dust in the dark field.\nClean the slide glass with detergent for 5 min, then rinse it with water. Put in an oven for drying.\nTake out the slide, immerse it in acetone solution, and sonicate for 30 min.\nImmerse the slide in ethanol and water in turn, and the same ultrasonic and oven-dry treatment is performed.",
    "Prepare the piranha solution in a beaker with the ratio of concentrated sulfuric acid to 30% hydrogen peroxide of 7: 3 (v/v).\nPut the glass slide in the beaker, and heat the piranha solution for 1 h.\nTake out the slide glass and rinse it with plenty of ultrapure water, and store it for later use after drying.\nNote: When preparing piranha solution, pay attention to adding concentrated sulfuric acid first and then slowly adding hydrogen peroxide, otherwise it may cause explosion. The used piranha solution should be cooled first, and then put the solution in the fume hood for a period of time to ensure that all gases are diffused, so that the remaining sulfuric acid is not too strong. The catalytic amount of Mn can be added here, because it can catalyze the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. Then carefully add the acid into water to dilute it into dilute sulfuric acid. After that, it can be disposed conventionally.\nReact the nanoprobe with the target DNA, dilute it 50 times and drop it on the slide, place it for 10 min and wash the slide with ultrapure water.",
    "Note: In dark-field observation, the solution reacted with the target DNA is dropped onto the silicon wafer for observation. Without prior dilution, too many nanoprobes present in the solution will stack on the silicon wafer, and the dense nanoprobes greatly increase the possibility of their proximity. In this protocol, particles with different aggregation states are distinguished by their different scattered light. However, the existence of the above situation will make some single particles mistakenly emit scattered light of aggregates, which is unfavorable for distinguishing particles with different aggregation states. Meanwhile, the protocol uses a lot of statistical analysis. In order to improve the efficiency of image analysis, dilution of the solution is also necessary.\nPut the dried slide glass on the stage, adjust the lens focus, and perform dark field imaging.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2717-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

This figure is quoted from Yu et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nNote: The original dark-field images show particles in different aggregation states (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A), and their differences can be explained by the scattering spectra (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B).\nFor image processing, use the following ImageJ code:\n/∗∗\n∗ This is an ImageJ macro for analyzing dark-field plasmonic imaging results\n∗ ImageJ Version: 1.52p\n∗/\n// set parameters for analyzing\n// threshold ∼ [prominence, hue, sat, intensity] ∼ for noise elimination\nprominence_threshold = 20;\n//hue_threshold = 150; // 0∼360\n//saturation_threshold = 0.1; // 0∼1\n//intensity_threshold = 30; // 0∼255\n//threshold = newArray(prominence_threshold,hue_threshold,saturation_threshold,intensity_threshold);\nmain();\n// main process definition\nfunction main(){",

The solution dropped can be reduced to accelerate the drying process. Try to avoid using the high temperature of oven, which may lead to the aggregation of particle.\nNote: The measurement parameters: excitation light wavelength is 785 nm, laser power is 25 mW, integration time is 10 s, scanning times are 3 times, 20× objective lens is used, and each group of experiments is repeated 3 times.\nFor the reproducibility experiment, test the SERS signals of 30 target DNA randomly (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2717-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8.

The error bars represent the standard deviations of repeated experiments. This figure is quoted from Yu et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nSelect single-stranded and double-stranded target DNA for statistical comparison with the particle aggregation without target DNA in dark field (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B).\nSelect the pathogen from Diaporthe and the non-target genus respectively for specificity test (Figures 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]C and 8D).\nNote: It can be seen from Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] that there are individual base differences among different species used for screening primer DNA. Therefore, slight SERS signal difference may occur when the target DNA from different species of the Diaporthe genus is detected. However, this does not affect the result of SERS detection, because compared with the control group, all the target DNA from this genus caused significant SERS signal enhancement.\nSERS measurement of actual samples\nTiming: 2 h\nThis part mainly introduces the steps of SERS detection.\nInfect kiwifruit with pathogens belongs to Diaporthe genus.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2717-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9.
