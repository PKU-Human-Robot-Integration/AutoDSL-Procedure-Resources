    "Preparation of cell extracts The basic method of cell extracts preparation was adapted from methods described earlier (Wickner et al., 1972; Villani et al., 1978).   Inoculate P. syringae Lz4W strain from a single colony (streaked on ABM agar plate and was incubated at 22 °C for 24-36 h) in 5 ml ABM liquid media (autoclaved in 25 ml flask). Grow it for overnight at 22 °C shaking at 200 rpm.    Inoculate a fresh secondary culture using the overnight grown cultures inoculum in a new 20 ml ABM broth (autoclaved in 100 ml flask) in 1:100 ratio dilution and grow at 22 °C till exponential growth phase (OD600~ 0.3 to 0.4, 6-7 h growth).   Pellet down cells by centrifuging at 10,000 rpm for 5 min at 22 °C.   Discard the supernatant, wash the pellet with 1 ml of buffer containing 10% sucrose containing 50 mM Tris.HCl (pH 7.5). Resuspend the pellet in 0.002 volume (40 µl for 20 ml culture) of 10% sucrose containing 50 mM Tris.HCl (pH 7.5) at room temperature (22-25 °C).    Add 1/10 th volume (4 µl) of a lysozyme solution and 0.025 volume (1 µl) of 4 M KCl. Incubate the mixture at 0 °C (on ice) for 30 min.    Centrifuge the lysate at 14,000 rpm for 45 min at 2 °C.   Supernatant was transferred to a fresh microcentrifuge tube and stored at 0 °C (on ice). Quantify the total protein concentration using NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer.  Note: Although this cell lysate is stable on ice for few hours, in most of our experiments we used this freshly prepared lysate within 30-60 min of preparation.      Preparation of template DNA (E. coli genomic DNA)   Isolate genomic DNA from E. coli strain MC4100 using genomic DNA isolation kit.",
    "Note: This step to be done one day before preparing the Pseudomonas cell extracts.    Shear the genomic DNA by passing it through a large gauge (22G) needle for several times (15-16 times to get 6-10 kb size of sheared DNA).   Determine the concentration of DNA by taking readings in NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer.   Denature the template DNA by incubating it for 2-3 min in a boiling water bath, and then immediately freeze it into ice water bath. This DNA will be used as a template to assay the DNA polymerization activity using any Gram-negative bacterial cell extracts.      DNA polymerization activity assay   Pre-incubate the aliquots of Pseudomonas cell lysate at the desired temperatures for 10 min. We used 22 °C and 4 °C for P. syringae cell extracts.   Prepare replicas (2 to 3) of two assay mixtures (experimental): One set to be incubated at 22 °C and another set at 4 °C.   Each assay mixture (50 µl) will have 1 μg of heat denatured template DNA (sheared E. coli genomic DNA), Random primer buffer (1x), Random hexanucleotide primers (1x), 0.8 mM each of dCTP, dGTP, dTTP and 40 μCi of [alpha-32P]-dATP. Pre-incubate the samples at the experimental temperatures (22 °C and 4 °C) for at least 5 min.  Note: Reaction volume to be adjusted using sterile Milli-Q water, considering the volume of cell extracts to be added, to make the final volume of 50 µl.    Prepare two more sets of assay mixtures as controls and process them as above. Control (negative) assay mixtures will have everything except the template DNA.     In the mean time, label the tubes for collecting reaction samples at different time points. For example, for six time points, take 6 micro centrifuge tubes for each assay mixture and labeled them as 0, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 sec.",
    "Add 30 µl of E. coli unlabeled denatured DNA (50 µg)  in stop buffer and 40 µl of 10% TCA into each tube as stop buffer. Notes:   Addition of E. coli unlabeled denatured DNA (cold DNA) increases the precipitation efficiency of labeled DNA (hot DNA).        The cold DNA was isolated from E. coli grown cells, heat denatured and immediately transferred in ice water.     Now, to start the experiment, add 100 µg of pre-incubated cell lysates into the assay mixtures (step C4) which were incubated at 22 °C and 4 °C.    Remove 10 µl of aliquote from each assay tubes at different time intervals (0, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 sec) and stop the reaction by adding into corresponding labeled tubes.   Incubate these tubes for 1 h at 0 °C to precipitate the labeled DNA and then centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C.   Remove the supernatant from the tubes containing unincorporated labels. To remove the drags, invert the tubes onto tissue paper or blotting paper for 2-3 min.    Place centrifuge tubes into plastic scintillation vials and measure the radioactivity directly without adding any scintillation fluid (cherenkov counting) in a scintillation counter.   Subtract the values (CPM) of control from the experimental value and calculate the rate of radioactivity incorporation.     The radioactivity (count per minute or CPM) incorporation into DNA or polymerization rate can be expressed as CPM per minute per milligram of protein in the cell extracts."
