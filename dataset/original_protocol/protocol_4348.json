    "The stressors schedule used in this protocol is listed in Table 1. Application of stress starts at a different time every day to minimize its predictability (from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.).   Table 1. Schedule of stressors used during chronic variant stress treatment ---------------------------------------------- Day   Stressor             Time ----- -----------------------   ------------ 1    Forced swimming  10 min 2     Restraint                 3 h 3    Water deprivation   24 h 4    Restrain at 4 °C      90 min 5    Isolation                 24 h 6    Food deprivation     24 h 7    Water deprivation   24 h 8    Restrain at 4 °C     2 h 9    Food deprivation    24 h -----------------------------------------------  Day 1: Forced swimming    Fill a glass tank 22 cm deep with water at 23 ± 2 °C (Figure 1).   Place the animal in the glass tank for 10 min. While the animal is swimming it may try to get out of the tank, so to prevent escape it may be necessary to carefully close it with a heavy lid.   Return the animal to a clean and dry cage with fresh bedding in order to avoid chills and colds.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20141204/20141204012526_8293.jpg Figure 1. Picture of a typical glass tank filled with cold water  Day 2: Restraint     Place the animal in a 21 x 6 cm plastic tube; adjust it with plastic tape on the outside so the animal is unable to move (Figure 2). The tube must have a 6 cm hole at the far end to allow regular breathing. To place the animal in the plastic tube, it is necessary to place the head of the animal close to the entrance, after which it should enter by itself (Figure 3).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20141204/20141204012620_8522.jpg Figure 2.

    "Although the plastic tube should be sufficient to prevent the animal coming out is desirable to leave the immobilizer inside the cage.   Return the animal to its cage. The best way to extract the animal is to make a sudden movement downwards, dropping it into the cage. Try to avoid pulling from the tail.  Day 3: Water deprivation     Remove the bottle of water from the cage during 24 h. If the animal house is supervised by staff, indicate that the water/food must not be replaced in that cage.   Place the bottle of water back after the time point is reached.  Day 4: Restraint at 4 °C     Place the animal in the above-mentioned plastic tube.   Place the tube with the animal inside a cold room or a refrigerator at 4 °C for 90 min. Cold is a well-documented stressor (Krishnamurthy et al., 2011). Therefore, it is necessary to find a place with these features to put the animals in.   Return the animal to its cage at room temperature.  Day 5: Isolation     Place the animal alone in a new cage.   Return the animal to the cage with their mates.  Day 6: Food deprivation     Remove the food from the cage for 24 h.   Place the food back.  Day 7: Water deprivation     Remove the water container from the cage for 24 h.   Place the bottle of water back.  Day 8: Restraint at 4 °C     Put the animal in the plastic tube described above.   Place the tube with the animal inside a cold room or a refrigerator at 4 °C for 2 h. It has been observed that after the first cold-environment exposure, 90 min at 4 °C is not enough time any more to reach adequate stress levels, that is why 2 h at 4 °C is more convenient.",
    "Return the animal to its cage at room temperature.  Day 9: Food deprivation     Remove the food from the cage for 24 h.   Place the food back."
