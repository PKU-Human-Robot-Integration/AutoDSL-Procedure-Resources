    "All patient samples are collected under an approved IRB protocol from consenting patients, whose samples are de-identified after tumor debulking and ascites collection.\n1. Generation of Spheroids from Small Cell Numbers in 384-well Hanging Drop Plates\nPlace the hanging drop plate in a sonicator filled with sterile deionized (DI) water and sonicate for 20 min.\nWith a gloved hand, remove the plate from the sonicator and wash it with running DI water.\nAllow the plate to sit in a bath of 0.1% Pluronic acid for 24 h to prevent protein adsorption and spheroid adherence to the wells.\nRemove plates with a gloved hand and rinse both sides of the plate with running DI water thoroughly.\nVigorously tap or shake the plate inside a biosafety cabinet to remove water from the wells in a sterile environment.\nPlace the plate under UV light for 30–60 min on each side to sterilize the plates and minimize contamination.\nNOTE: The plate can also be exposed to ethylene oxide gas in a chamber for sterilization.\nFill each well of a 6-well plate with 4–5 mL of sterile autoclaved DI water and sandwich the hanging drop plate between the lid and the bottom of the 6-well plate. Add 800–1,000 μL of sterile DI water around the rim of the hanging drop plate to provide a humid, stable, and sterile environment to minimize volume lost to evaporation (Figure 1 A-C).\nFor 2D grown cells, aspirate medium covering cells in their log phase of growth and wash with 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to remove traces of fetal bovine serum (FBS) in the growth medium, as it hampers the action of trypsin.",
    "Aspirate the PBS and add 1.5-2 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA to the 100 mm tissue culture dish. Incubate cells for 5 min in an incubator set to 37 °C.\nNOTE: Cells may detach at different rates, so plates should be checked on a benchtop light microscope to ensure cell detachment after 5 min. Adjust detachment protocol per vendor instructions when using a cell line.\nAdd 6–8 mL of cellular medium containing FBS or any serum to the dish to neutralize the trypsin, collect cells with a 10 mL serological pipet, and deposit them in a 15 mL conical tube.\nCount cells by loading 10 μL of the cell suspension on each side of a hemocytometer and follow the associated counting protocol.\nFor patient-derived cells collected from primary or metastatic solid tumors or from ascites that have not been 2D cultured, prepare single cell suspensions in serum free medium (SFM) described previously3.\nProcess tumor tissues as previously described and store single cell suspensions for later use in appropriate freezing medium21,22.\n\t\nFor solid tumor tissue, mince mechanically with a razor blade and filter resulting solution through a 40 μm filter before isolating desired cells from a density gradient21,22.\nFor ascites samples, concentrate cells by centrifugation, lyse red blood cells in ammonium-chloride-potassium (ACK) buffer, wash in 1x PBS, and then pass through a 40 μm filter and a 28 G needle 4 times22.\nFor isolation of ovarian CSCs, sort cells with flow cytometry as described below in detail.\nFreshly isolated single cells are frozen for storage and thawed when needed for experimentation.\nTo prepare the cell suspension for plating, calculate the desired volume of cell solution required for plating: 20 μL per drop X total number of droplets = total solution volume needed.",
    "Dilute cell concentration to the desired cell concentration per 20 μL (i.e., 100 cells in a 20 μL drop).\nMix the cell suspension gently using a pipet before before plating to ensure homogeneous distribution of cells and improve uniformity between droplets.\nNOTE: Overmixing of the cell suspension may lead to cell death and debris in the hanging drop spheroids.\nPlace the tip of the pipette in the well at an angle of approximately 45° and pipet 20 μL of the cell solution into each hanging drop well.\nNOTE: Plating patterns can be adjusted depending on number of spheroids needed. Plating spheroids in every other well is safer when large quantities of spheroids are not needed in an experiment, because it prevents accidental merging of the droplets (Figure 1D, E). If large quantities of spheroids are needed for an experiment, plate every well leaving one row of border wells on all sides (Figure 1F).\nPlace the lid of the 6-well plate back on top of the hanging drop plate and use a stretchy thermoplastic strip that is insensitive to moisture loss, to seal the edges and prevent additional evaporation of droplets. Incubate in a standard CO2 humidified incubator (5% CO2, 37 °C).\nFeed hanging drops once every 2–3 days to replenish cell culture medium for necessary nutrients by adding 2–3 μL to each spheroid containing well.\nNOTE: After imaging, it is always advised to feed the hanging drops, as air exposure during imaging leads to evaporation.\n2. Adding Cell Culture Medium to Hanging Drop Spheroid Plates\nRemove the thermoplastic strip and lid within a biosafety cabinet and add 2–3 μL of the appropriate culture medium to each well containing a hanging drop.\nNOTE: The volume added will depend on drop size and the amount of time between feedings.",
    "After feeding, cover the plate with the top lid and apply fresh thermoplastic strip to the outside edges before putting the plate back in the incubator.\n3. Phase Contrast Imaging of Spheroid Morphology\nRemove the thermoplastic strip from around the edges of the plate in a biosafety cabinet.\nCarefully remove the 384-well hanging drop spheroids plate from the biosafety cabinet with the lid still in place and place it in the microscope tray at an epifluorescent microscope.\nUse the live imaging option in the imaging software at 4x, 10x or 20x to observe the hanging drop spheroids and take desired images.\nAfter saving the images, take the plate back to the biosafety cabinet and feed cells as described above.\nReseal plate with a fresh thermoplastic strip and place the sealed plate back in the incubator.\n4. Quantification of Proliferation and Viability within Spheroids\nPlate spheroids in a sufficient number of wells to obtain >10 technical replicates for each time point (i.e., day 1 and day 7) that is to be examined.\nNOTE: Wells that are used for this assay are generally not used again due to potential contaminants from the resazurin dye.\nAdd 2 μL of filtered resazurin-based solution to the wells designated for proliferation analysis as if feeding those wells and incubate for a pre-determined incubation period.\nNOTE: This incubation time can vary based on cell type and the number of cells in the spheroid. It is advised to determine the required incubation time needed prior to beginning proliferation experiments by beginning measurements after 1 hour incubation and then re-measuring every 30 min until the signal readouts in control wells plateau. Assay readings can be taken as many times as desired. Incubation is typically 4 h for spheroids initiated with 100 cancer cells.",
    "Turn on the microplate reader first followed by the associated plate reader software at least 15 min prior to first reading to allow for the machine to warm up and secure the internal temperature at 22 °C as temperature can affect the readings.\nOpen a 384-well plate protocol set with 530/25 nm excitation and 590/35 nm emission wavelengths with Optics set to Bottom, Gain set to 35, Read Speed set to Normal, and read type set to Fluorescence.\nAfter the incubation period, open the hanging drop sandwich in a biosafety cabinet and bring the 384-well plate with the lid still in place to the plate reader.\nPlace the 384-well plate with the lid still in place in the plate reader tray, which will be extended once the machine is warmed up and click Ok to read the plate.\nReturn the well plate to the 6-well base and place it in the incubator. If all time points have been read for the day, reseal the plate before placing it back in the incubator.\nSave the experiment in the pop-up window and then click Yes when prompted Do you want to execute PowerExports for Plate 1 to output data from the plate reader software into a spreadsheet for organization.\nAverage fluorescence values for each condition and normalize by the average of the control condition to report fold change in proliferation in various experimental conditions.\nWhen comparing day 1 to day 7, normalize by dividing by day 1 average fluorescence to obtain fold change in proliferation over time.\nCalculate error bars using standard error of the mean and determine statistical significance between experimental groups with an appropriate statistical test, like the student’s two-tailed T test.\n5. Evaluation of Drug Toxicity in Spheroids\nDrug administration",
    "At any time following spheroid formation, deliver drug diluted to the desired concentration such that a 2 μL dose contains 10x the desired final drug concentration.\nNOTE: This is assuming an evaporation of 2 μL from the droplet so that the ending volume post drug treatment is 20 μL. For example, a 50 μM dose of cisplatin will have a prepared solution of 500 μM. If droplets contain more than 20 μL, the concentration of drug and/or the volume added should be adjusted accordingly.\nTreat control samples with 2 μL of cell culture medium.\nNOTE: Cisplatin is solubilized in water. Therefore, controls are 2 μL of cell culture medium; however, if the drug vehicle is a different solvent (e.g., DMSO), then controls should be cell culture medium with an equal concentration of DMSO as used in the drug treatment.\nContinue to monitor the drug treated and the control spheroids throughout the drug incubation period with phase microscopy to have a visual record of the effect of drug toxicity as well as with resazurin dye as described above to monitor cellular viability.\nNOTE: Typically, the drugs are added after 5–7 days in the hanging drops and toxicity measured after 48–-72 hs but this can be varied depending on the experiment. Drugs can be added as soon as stable spheroids have formed, usually between 1–4 days.\nDrug toxicity quantification by cell counting\nAt the end time point of drug treatment, collect 10 spheroids each from control and drug treated wells using a 1,000 μL pipet and deposit each set of spheroids into its own microcentrifuge tube.\nBreak down the spheroids into single cells by repeated pipetting.",
    "NOTE: To reduce potential cell damage due to repeated pipetting, enzymatic digestion with an enzyme such as trypsin can be performed to facilitate generation of single cell solutions prior to pipetting23. Minimization of cell death due to pipetting will depend on the cell type and should be optimized accordingly. If concerned about death due to disaggregation, refer to analysis with resazurin dye and the cytotoxicity assay for alternative methods that do not require spheroid disaggregation.\nCentrifuge the tubes for 5 min at 400 x g to collect cells at the bottom of microcentrifuge tubes and aspirate the supernatant.\nAdd 20 μL of fresh media or 1x PBS to each tube and mix well.\nAdd Trypan blue at a ratio of 2 μL of Trypan blue stain to 20 μL of cell suspension.\nLoad 10 μL of cells and Trypan blue suspension into each chamber of the hemocytometer and count cells under a light microscope, with blue stained cells representing dead cells and unstained cells representing live cells.\n\t\t\nThe live cell % = (Number of live cells ÷ total number of cells) x 100.\n6. Spheroid Characterization with Histological Techniques\nNOTE: There are two mold options 3D printed in a biocompatible polymer to replicate spheroid array molds made by Ivanov et al.24: 1) 20 well mold that can hold 28 μL per well and 2) 63 well mold that can hold 9 μL per well (Figure 2D).\nSterilize histology mold and its border by wiping them down with 70% ethanol and attach the border firmly around the mold and lay the mold upright. Both molds fit approximately 3 mL of fluid (3.203 mL for the 20 spheroid array and 3.196 mL for the 63 spheroid array).",
    "Lightly coat the spheroid array with 10,000 cSt Si oil using a pointed cotton swab to facilitate removal of the specimen processing gel cast in subsequent steps.\nWarm up specimen processing gel until liquefied via microwave for 10–20 s with the cap loosened.\nAdd between 2.6 and 2.8 mL of molten processing gel into the mold until approximately level with the top of the border.\nIn a few minutes, once solidified, remove the processing gel cast by separating the border from the mold and then inverting the array mold.\nInsert tweezer tip between mold and the border to carefully separate them and then use a cell scraper to help dislodge the cast from the mold if it does not detach right away.\nHarvest the spheroids from the hanging drop plate by pipetting the contents of a single well onto a 100 or 150 mm cell petri dish with a 1,000 μL pipet, and isolate the spheroid visually.\nPipet 5 μL of the well contents including the identified spheroid into one of the array wells, until the array is filled.\nWait 3 min to ensure spheroids have settled to the bottom of the array before gently pipetting molten processing gel into each of the wells being careful not to disturb the spheroids.\nAdd additional processing gel to level off the top of the array and once cooled, place the solidified spheroid array into a labeled cassette for processing.\nSubmerge labeled cassette in 4% formalin overnight to fix the spheroids at 4 °C and then store in 70% ethanol at 4 °C until ready for processing.\nProcess with standard 1 h paraffin program and then embed the spheroid arrays such that the processed arrays are facing upright with the bottom of the wells closest to the block face.",
    "Ensure that the arrays are embedded as flat as possible, with the bottom face flush with the bottom of the block and place blocks on ice.\nLoad the block onto the microtome and adjust the block such that the blade is parallel with the loaded block face.\nCut array (sample depth = 15 μm) until the bottom of the array wells are reached making sure that the circular wells are visible on cut samples.\nSwitch to a 5 μm sample depth and continue to slice and collect ribbons. Check under the microscope every few slices to determine if spheroid depth has been reached. Once spheroids are reached collect each subsequent slide until the spheroids are no longer visible.\nStain each slide with standard H&E protocol.\n7. Live Dead Cytotoxicity Assay\nTo each hanging drop, add the live cell dye, calcein-AM to the final concentration of 2 μM, and the dead cell dye, ethidium homodimer-1 to the final concentration of 4 μM, keeping in mind that the drop volume is 20 μL.\nNOTE: Try to keep volumes added to a minimum, and typically add 2 μL of the dyes combined.\nPlace plates back in incubator sandwiched in a 6-well plate with a lid and incubate the spheroids for 45 min at 37 °C.\nNOTE: Depending on the size of spheroids, this incubation time significantly varies. For example, spheroids under 400 μm typically only require 30–45 min of incubation time, whereas larger spheroids closer to 800 μm have required up to 90 min of incubation time. Incubation times must be optimized for an individual’s experiment.\nFor subsequent imaging, harvest spheroids with a 1,000 μL pipet in a biosafety cabinet and deposit each spheroid onto pre-cleaned glass microscope slides.\nImage spheroids through the glass, on an inverted confocal microscope.",
    "NOTE: Depending on the proximity of the confocal microscope to the lab in which spheroids are harvested, the spheroids can either be imaged in the original droplet of medium placed on the slide or encased in 2% agarose if more stability is required for spheroid transport.\nUsing the Multidimensional Acquisition mode in the microscope software, locate the spheroid using DIC illumination at 10x magnification and then scan the z-plane to identify the heights encompassing the spheroid.\nClick on Z Series and set the upper and lower limit of the z-scan slightly higher than the top of the spheroid and slightly lower than the bottom of the spheroid.\nExcite the spheroids at 488 nm for calcein-AM (live cells; green) and 561 nm for ethidium homodimer-1 (dead cells; red) with the step size recommended by the software, maximal gain and minimal exposure for each color.\nClick Acquire to obtain a composite z-stack image of live and dead cells within the spheroid.\nQuantify live/dead proportions using image processing software to quantify a percentage of pixel intensity from the channel corresponding to live cells versus the percentage of pixel intensity from the channel corresponding to dead cells from the composite z-projection images.\nNOTE: Due to the limitations in quantifying a 3D structure with a 2D projection, an alternative method to quantify live versus dead fluorescence, within the hanging drop plates is to use a plate reader following the protocol included with the calcein-AM and ethidium homodimer-1 kit.\n8. Immunofluorescence\nHeat a low melting 2% agarose solution, so the solution is viscous and just above melting point and place on a microscope slide to create a soft bed of agarose\nHarvest spheroids by pushing 20 μL of PBS through the drop onto the soft bed of 2% agarose.",
    "NOTE: This should be done quickly so that agarose does not solidify before spheroids are embedded.\nOnce the agarose cools and gels with the harvested spheroid trapped within (under 5 min), add 4% neutral buffered formalin to fix the spheroids. Alternately, add ice cold methanol, and fix the agarose-embedded spheroids at -20 °C for 30 min.\nWash 3x for 5 min each with 1x PBS, discarding PBS after each wash.\nBlock for 1 h at RT with 10% serum (i.e., horse serum) and 0.15% soap solution (Triton X-100) in 1x PBS.\nWash 3x for 5 min each with 1x PBS, discarding PBS after each wash.\nStain spheroids with desired fluorescent antibody at recommended or pre-determined antibody dilution (i.e., fluorescently labeled phalloidin at a 1:100 dilution), incubating for at least 90 min at room temperature, covered from light.\nNOTE: Protocols will vary depending on antibody and target and antibody dilution may need to be optimized depending on the experiment.\nVisualize fluorescently stained spheroids with the inverted confocal microscope using methods outlined in the previous section for imaging spheroids.\nComposite z-stack images will demonstrate 3D morphology in the spheroids.\n9. Collection and Analysis of Cancer Stem Cell Populations with Flow Cytometry\nPreparing spheroids for flow cytometry analysis\nCollect spheroids from each well in the hanging drop plates using a 1,000 µL pipet and deposit them into a 15 mL centrifuge tube for disaggregation with repeated pipetting.\nCount viable cells on a hemocytometer using Trypan Blue to determine cell number and concentration as outlined above.\nAliquot cell suspension into five microcentrifuge tubes such that each contains a minimum of 50,000 cells.\nCentrifuge all tubes at 400 x g for 5 min in a microcentrifuge.\nAspirate the supernatant from each tube and resuspend pellets in 100 μL of buffer.",
    "Label tubes “Unstained”, “DAPI”, “APC-iso”, “DEAB”, and “ALDH/CD133”, respectively.\nAdd 0.5 μL of APC-isotype antibody to the APC-iso tube and 1 μL of CD133 antibody to the ALDH/CD133 tube as determined by serial dilution and manufacturers recommendation.\nAdd 5 μL of DEAB Reagent and 0.5 μL of ALDH to the DEAB tube, and 1 μL of ALDH to the ALDH/CD133 tube.\nVortex all tubes for approximately 2 s and incubate at 37 °C for 45 min.\nVortex all tubes again and centrifuge at 400 x g for 5 min in a microcentrifuge.\nLabel FACS tubes “Unstained”, “DAPI”, “APC-iso”, “DEAB”, and “ALDH/CD133” and fill an insulated foam container to set aside.\nAspirate supernatant and resuspend the “unstained” control in 400 μL FACS Buffer (1x PBS with 2% FBS) and all other tubes in 400 μL of FACS DAPI Buffer (FACS Buffer with 300 μM 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole).\nPlace tubes in container with ice until analyzed on a flow cytometer.\nNOTE: To sort for ovarian cancer stem cells, collect all cells that the cytometer measures to be ALDH+ and CD133+ with gates set to include 0.5% non-specific APC signal and 0.15% non-specific ALDH+ signal. At least 10,000 cells need to be analyzed for reliable results. Additional details can be found in recent publications3,17.\nAnalysis of ALDH+/CD133+ populations in FlowJo\nDouble click the FlowJo icon to open the program and drag .fcs files obtained from flow cytometry software into the workspace.\nDouble click the unstained file and set the y-axis to side scatter height (SSC-H) and the x-axis to forward scatter height (FSC-H).\nClick the T button next to each axis to adjust the scale and transformation to maximize the separation between different cell populations.\nClick on the Polygon gating button and draw a polygon gate around the cell population and label the population ‘Cells’.",
    "Double click the Cells population in the workspace to view only the cells within the ‘Cells’ population and then click on the FSC axis to change the axis channel to FSC-width and then click on the SSC axis and change the axis channel to the FSC-H.\nChoose the Rectangle gate tool and draw a rectangle around the left-most dense population of cells spanning the entirety of the y-axis to exclude potential doublets toward the right of the window and label this gate ‘Single Cells’.\nRight click and copy the Cells and the nested Single Cells gate and paste them under each sample in the workspace.\nDouble click the Single Cells gate nested under the DAPI sample in the workspace to view the single cell population from that sample tube and click on the FSC axis and change the axis channel to the DAPI - Area channel.\nClick on the SSC axis and change the axis channel to Histogram.\n\t\tNOTE: The live cells will be towards the left as they exclude DAPI, while dead cells will take in the DAPI and appear towards the right of the graph.\nClick on the T button next to the DAPI axis and click on Customize Axis to adjust the scale to maximize separation between DAPI positive and DAPI negative peaks.\nNOTE: A window will pop up with scaling options. Often times, setting the Scale field to Biex and adjusting the Extra Negative Decades and Width Basis will yield the greatest separation.\nClick Apply in the pop-up window to apply scaling changes, choose the Range gate button, and spread it over the DAPI negative peak, corresponding to the live cell population.",
    "Label this gate ‘Live Cells’ and right click to copy the ‘Live Cells’ gate to paste it under the ‘Single Cells’ gate under the ‘APC-iso, ‘DEAB’, and ‘ALDH/CD133’ tubes to select the same portion of live cells in each sample tube.\nThen double click the Live Cells population nested under the APC-iso sample file and switch the x-axis to the ALDH — Area channel and the y-axis to the APC — Area channel.\nAgain, adjust the axis scale by clicking the T button and Customize Axis of each axis so that the events are localized in the bottom left region of the plot and select the Quad gate option and click the plot window to establish a quadrant gate.\nAdjust the intersection of the gate such that approximately 0.5% of the population lies in the upper left of the plot window or ‘APC positive’ quadrant.\nNOTE: This 0.5% represents the non-specific staining of the APC isotype.\nRight click each quadrant label individually in the workspace and rename them appropriately. Control or Command click each quadrant gate label in the workspace and copy them.\nNOTE: ‘Q1’ represents CD133+ cells; ‘Q2’ represents CD133+ and ALDH+’ cells; ‘Q3’ represents ALDH+ cells; and ‘Q4’ represents CD133- and ALDH- cells.\nPaste the quadrant gates onto the Live Cells population nested under the ‘DEAB’ file. Adjust the vertical line such that approximately 0.15% of the cell population lies within the ‘ALDH+’ quadrant taking care not to move the horizontal line.\nNOTE: This 0.15% represents non-specific ALDH signal.\n\t\t\nTo ensure that the horizontal line did not change position, copy the new quadrant gates nested under the DEAB file and paste them onto the Live Cells under the APC iso file. Select Yes when asked to replace existing quadrant gate.",
    "Verify in the workspace that the ‘CD133+’ percent is still approximately 0.5 under the ‘APC-iso’ file.\nCopy and paste the quadrant gates to the ‘ALDH/CD133’ file’s ‘Live Cells’ population.\nNOTE: The percentage of the viable cell population present in the top right quadrant will be the percentage of ALDH+ and CD133+ double positive CSCs within the sample.\nSubscription Required.
