  "title": "Extremely Rapid and Specific Metabolic Labelling of RNA In Vivo with 4-Thiouracil (Ers4tU)",
  "procedures": [
    "1. Growth and thio-labelling\nNOTE: Time for completion of this section of the protocol is highly variable, depending on cell growth rate. Allow 1 h to prepare the solutions and equipment prior to thio-labelling and 30 min post-labelling to process samples.\nEnsure the S. cerevisiae strain contains a plasmid encoding a permease (Table 1) to boost 4tU import into the cell.\n\tNOTE: Without an importer, labelling for less than 2 min is unlikely to be successful11 (see Supplementary Figure 1). 4tU incorporation is more efficient if growth is in medium without uracil, so the strain must be URA3+; several of the plasmids in Table 1 carry URA3 as marker. If this protocol is to be combined with β-est AID depletion7, additional strain modifications are required.\nPrepare YMM uracil-free medium by adding 6.9 g of yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 20 g of glucose, and 1.92 g of SCSM single drop-out−ura (Table of Materials) to 1 L of water. Autoclave or filter sterilize the growth medium before use.\n\tNOTE: Filter sterilization is preferred as peptide/sugar complexes produced by autoclaving co-precipitate with the cells in the methanol used in sample collection.\nGrow yeast in YMM uracil-free medium to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.6−0.8. Ensure the culture is in log phase growth and has been for at least two doublings. Growth at 30 °C is normally recommended, but other temperatures may be used, for example, for temperature-sensitive strains.",
    "NOTE: Depending on the strain, growth conditions and RNA yield, approximately 30 mL sample volume will be needed. This amount will be assumed throughout the protocol. 30 mL of culture is the most that will fit into a 50 mL centrifuge tube with 20 mL of methanol, so is a convenient volume to start optimization. Consider using more sample volume for early time points to increase RNA recovery, up to 2000 mL has been used for slower growing cells at really short labelling times (<1 min).\nChill about 50 mL of H2O on ice. For each sample, add 200 µL of zirconia beads to a 2 mL screw-cap tube and chill on ice. Also put 20 mL of methanol (CAUTION), into 50 mL centrifuge tubes, and place on dry ice (CAUTION). The methanol should be 1/3 to 2/3 the volume of the sample.\n\tCAUTION: Methanol is toxic by inhalation, contact and consumption. Dispense large volumes in a fume hood, and wear two pairs of gloves, as methanol can penetrate nitrile laboratory gloves. Methanol is highly flammable, keep away from all sources of ignition.\n\tNOTE: As dry ice can cause cold burns on contact and produces asphixiant gas, use gloves when handling and use in a well-ventilated space.\n\tNOTE: Adding the beads at this point is easier than after the sample has been added as the tube is dry and when spinning down the cell pellet the beads are also spun clear of the tube thread saving some time. Additionally, this allows the beads to cool before the sample is added.",
    "If an S. pombe spike is to be added to the culture (rather than later), thaw an aliquot of thiolated S. pombe cells on ice and vortex thoroughly, at least 30 s, then add to the culture. If prepared according to the instructions below, one S. pombe aliquot is sufficient for 400 mL of culture (enough for twelve 30 mL samples plus a little to allow for errors in handling). If more or less culture is used, adjust the volume of S. pombe added to the culture.\n\t\nGrow 1 L of S. pombe culture to OD600 to 0.8 exactly as described in the protocol for S. cerevisiae.\nThio-label as step 1.7, but for 10 min.\nFix all of the culture using 400 mL of methanol on dry ice, essentially as described in step 1.9.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 3000 x g for 3 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 3.3 mL of H2O.\nSplit into aliquots of 80 µL each. Store at -80 °C.\nUse all of one aliquot for 400 mL culture or 10 µL per 30 mL sample.\n\t\tNOTE: Reduce the volume of spike to 1/10 if performing RNAseq. Do not reuse aliquots; discard any unused spike. This spike is useful to normalize and compare results across time points and experiments.\nFor discontinuous labelling, induce the required metabolic perturbation (e.g., growth conditions, gene induction or depletion such as β-est AID7 (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 2), then split the culture. Ensure all flasks and media are at the required temperature and, if possible, aerate the medium before adding the culture.",
    "Add 4tU to the culture to a concentration of 10 µmM and mix vigorously (1/10,000 of the culture volume of 100 mM 4tU dissolved in 1 M NaOH). Thiol-label for 15 s to 5 min.\n\tNOTE: Thirty seconds is a good starting point. Thio-labelling for less than 20 s gives more variable results due to difficulties manipulating the culture under time pressure. However, labelling for more than 1 min reduces the temporal resolution of the technique.\nIf a chase experiment is to be performed; allow thio-labelling for 20−30 s then chase by adding 1/200 culture volume of 1 M uridine (not thiolated), to a final concentration of 5 mM.\n\tNOTE: Uridine is preferable to uracil for the chase, as uridine is more water soluble allowing a smaller volume to be added to the culture and so there is less disturbance to the growth of the cells.\nTake samples of culture at regular intervals (at least 15 s), to the end of the time course. Sampling intervals shorter than this are difficult to perform reliably. Add the sample to the methanol on dry ice prepared in step 1.4. For convenience, add 30 mL of culture to a 50 mL tube containing 20 mL of methanol.\n\tNOTE: Carbon dioxide dissolves in the methanol when cold; this comes out of solution on addition of the sample and foams vigorously upon mixing―resulting in sample loss. To avoid this, chill the methanol to <-70 °C in a tightly sealed tube until close to the time it is needed, then transfer to dry ice.",
    "Seal the tube and mix thoroughly by shaking. Place the samples on ice. Check that none of the samples have frozen; if so, gently warm in the hand, inverting constantly. This is best done in the hand as the sample’s temperature can be assessed, it should always feel cold. Place on ice. This is not a pause point; once all the sample is fluid proceed to the next step.\nSpin at 3000 x g for 2 min (at 4 °C if possible) to pellet the cells. Pour off the liquid and resuspend the pellet in at least 1 mL of ice-cold water by gently pipetting up and down.\n\tNOTE: The residual methanol in the sample pellet aids resuspension.\nTransfer to 2 mL screw cap tubes as prepared in step 1.4. Spin briefly (e.g., 10 s total time) at >13,000 x g to re-pellet the cells, place back on ice and remove liquid.\n\tNOTE: The cell pellet can be stored at -70 to -80 °C for several months.\n2. Preparation of total RNA\nNOTE: The time for completion is 90 min.\nUse diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated solutions to protect the RNA from degradation. Aliquot the solutions using filter pipette tips and wear gloves at all times.\n\t\nTo a solution add 1/1000 volume of DEPC and mix by vigorous shaking.\nLeave at room temperature (RT) for 24 h, then autoclave.\nSolutions with amine groups (such as tris) cannot be DEPC treated. Aliquot the powder and store specially for RNA work. Use previously DEPC treated H2O to make the solution.\n\t\tNOTE: As the thio-group on the RNA is photoactivatable, minimize exposure to UV light from this point on. Storage should be in the dark and incubation is best done in a PCR machine with a lid.",
    "If an S. pombe spike is to be added to the cell pellet rather than the culture (do not do both), add it now. Thaw an aliquot of thiolated S. pombe cells on ice and vortex thoroughly, at least 30 s, before adding to the pellet.\n\tNOTE: If prepared according to steps 1.5.1−1.5.7, 10 µL of S. pombe aliquot is required for one pellet derived from 30 mL of culture.\nBefore putting on the cap, spin very briefly for 1−2 s to ensure that no zirconia beads are trapped between the cap and the tube, which can cause sample and phenol to leak from the tube.\nResuspend the cells in 400 µL of acetate EDTA (AE) buffer (50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.3, 10 mM EDTA pH 8.0), by vortexing vigorously. Add 40 µL of 10% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Do not vortex, as SDS will foam.\nIf the β-est AID 4U protocol is to be used, take 40 µL of the cell suspension for protein analysis7. Add 40 µL of AE to make the volume back up to 400 µL.\nAdd 800 µL of phenol (CAUTION) at low pH and vortex for 10 s.\n\tCAUTION: Phenol is toxic and corrosive by inhalation and contact. Always perform procedures involving phenol in a fume hood and wear two pairs of gloves.\nLyse the cells in a homogenizer (e.g., Table of Materials) for three 2-min bursts at the lowest power setting. Leave the samples on ice for 2 min between pulses of homogenization.",
    "NOTE: Optimize the conditions if using other homogenizers. Insufficient shaking will result in poor yields, whereas excessive shaking results in apparent higher yield, as determined by absorbance at 260 nm (A260), but the RNA may be degraded. A homogenizer is preferred, but hot phenol RNA purification12 can be used.\nPlace the lysed sample on dry ice for 5 min, until it solidifies, this reduces genomic DNA carry over into the RNA. Do not freeze for too long as the sample will not thaw. Spin 5 min in microfuge at >13,000 x g at RT; do not be tempted to do this at 4 °C, as the sample/phenol mix will remain solid throughout the spin if performed at low temperature.\n\tNOTE: If the sample is still frozen at the end of the spin, re-spin for another 5 min until the sample has completely thawed.\nPhenol/chloroform extract then chloroform extract with an equal volume (approximately 600 µL) of phenol:chloroform 5:1 then chloroform (CAUTION). Transfer the top phase to another tube containing phenol:chloroform 5:1 or chloroform. Vortex, then spin for 5 min in a microfuge at RT. Then transfer the top phase to a new 1.5 mL tube.\n\tCAUTION: Chloroform is toxic by inhalation and contact. Always perform procedures involving chloroform in a fume hood and wear two pairs of gloves.\nAdd a third to half volume (approximately 300 µL) of 10 M LiCl, and mix to precipitate the RNA. The sample should go cloudy immediately but leave for at least 10 min on ice or at 4 °C (do not store below -20 °C as it will freeze), or until the precipitate flocculates.",
    "Spin for 5 min at >13,000 x g in a microfuge. Remove the fluid, briefly re-spin and remove the dregs. Wash pellet with 300−500 µL of 70% ethanol, spin briefly and remove remaining ethanol.\n\tNOTE: During these washes keep the pellet on the same side of the tube as the first spin, this way the pellet will not move and break; if it breaks some of the RNA could be lost accidently.\n\tNOTE: Do not dry the pellet; as long as most of the fluid has been removed it will not interfere with subsequent steps. The RNA can also be stored at this stage at -20 °C for a few months or -70 to -80 °C for long-term storage.\nRe-dissolve the RNA pellet in 90 µL of TE pH 7.0 (10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0) by heating at 65 °C with shaking as the RNA pellet can be difficult to re-dissolve. This must be for no more than 5 min as RNA degrades at higher temperatures. Check for full RNA solubilization and then transfer to a 0.2 mL tube. Pipette the sample up and down; there should be no \"lumps\", and the fluid should rise and fall smoothly in the tip. This solution is viscous so the final pipetting motion should be slow.\n\tNOTE: The RNA can be stored at -20 °C in the dark at this stage; this can also be beneficial to RNA solubility.\n3. Biotinylation\nNOTE: The time for completion is 60 min. The following steps are conveniently done in a strip of tubes with integral caps as they have less tendency to open on vortexing than strips with separate caps.",
    "Biotinylate by adding 10 µL (1/10 final volume) of a 5 mM HPDP-biotin solution (MTS-biotin can be used in exactly the same way as HPDP-biotin), to the RNA and mix thoroughly. Preheat the RNA for no more than a few seconds at 65 °C before adding the biotin. Incubate at 65 °C for 15 min to a maximum of 30 min in the dark.\n\tNOTE: This heating is required as some HPDP batches precipitate at RT in the RNA sample. A PCR block with a heated lid is ideal for this.\nPrepare a small resin volume, size exclusion column (Table of Materials) to exclude the unincorporated biotin. Remove the bottom tag of the column and loosen the cap, place in a 2 mL centrifuge tube. Spin at 1500 x g for 1 min to flush out the buffer Add 0.3 mL of TE gently to the top of the column and spin again. Repeat the wash and spin twice more for a total of 3 washes. Finally transfer the washed column to a fresh 1.5 mL tube.\nOnce the sample incubation (step 3.1) is complete, add the sample to the top of the column. Spin at 1500 x g for 2 min. The biotinylated RNA sample is now in the bottom of the tube.\n\tNOTE: A 1 min spin is not sufficient to elute the entire sample.\nAdd a third to half volume (approximately 40 µL) of 10 M LiCl, mix to re-precipitate the RNA as step 2.10. The sample should go cloudy immediately but leave for at least 5 min on ice or at 4 °C or until the precipitate flocculates; do not store below -20 °C as it will freeze. Centrifuge the sample for 5 min at >13,000 x g in a microfuge.",
    "Wash with 80% ethanol, ≤1 h rotating. Follow the procedure in step 2.11 to remove as much of the fluid as possible.\n\tNOTE: As HPDP-biotin is very soluble in 80% ethanol, this is an additional purification step.\nRepeat the 80% ethanol wash to remove as much un-incorporated biotin as possible.\n\tNOTE: The RNA can also be stored at this stage at -20 °C in the dark.\n4. Purification of the newly synthesized RNA\nNOTE: The time for completion is 2 h.\nRe-dissolve the RNA in 200 µL of DEPC-treated H2O (65 °C incubation can be used, similar to the procedure in step 2.12).\nMeasure the RNA concentration at A260 using a spectrophotometer; the sample may have to be diluted 1/10 to get it within the linear range of the spectrophotometer. Vortex this dilution for at least 10 s to ensure the viscous RNA is evenly dissolved.\n\tNOTE: The efficiency of biotinylation can be assessed by dot blot13 if required.\nAdd equal amounts of RNA to a fresh tube and make up to 200 µL in DEPC-treated H2O. Use all of the sample with the lowest RNA concentration and use an appropriate volume of the other samples to have a similar amount of RNA for each.\n\tNOTE: The spreadsheet 4tU experiment template.xlsx has a form to aid this calculation.\nWhen the sample is at RT, add 25 µL of 10 x NaTM buffer (0.1 M Tris HCl pH 7.0, 2 M NaCl, 250 mM MgCl2), 25 µL of 1 M NaPi pH 6.8 (0.5 M NaH2PO4 0.5 M Na2HPO4), and 2.5 µL of 10% SDS. Mix thoroughly and spin gently (<30 s; approximately 100 x g).\n\tNOTE: To avoid precipitation of the SDS and salts, the samples must be kept at RT throughout the following procedures up to step 4.13.",
    "Make the bead buffer containing 1x NaTM buffer, 0.1 M NaPi, and 0.1% SDS, 2 mL per sample. Add the required amount of H2O first and the SDS last. This must be made fresh each time as a precipitate forms after 24 h.\n\tNOTE: To avoid the formation of precipitates, the bead buffer must be kept at RT throughout the following procedures. Do not DEPC treat or autoclave.\nAdd 50 µL of streptavidin beads to a low retention 1.5 mL tube. Place the tube on the magnetic rack, wait for the beads to settle and then remove the fluid\nWash the streptavidin beads.\n\t\nAdd 200 µL of bead buffer and vortex until the bead pellet is fully resuspended. Usually 3−5 s is all that is required. For washes before the RNA sample is added it is sufficient to turn the tubes round so the beads travel across the tube to the other side. Then turn the tubes back to the original side so the beads travel across the tube once again.\nSpin the tube at low speed (approximately 100 x g) for a maximum of 5 s to spin down the fluid, but not the beads.\nPlace in the magnetic rack to allow the beads to be captured by the magnet.\nRemove the fluid by aspiration for a small number of samples; pour off the liquid if many samples.",
    "NOTE: With a large number of samples, removing all the fluid purely by aspiration can be problematic, as the beads in the first sample may be dried out before the last sample is finished, this increases background. Washing can be expedited by pouring off the fluid from all samples at once whilst on the magnet. They should be left a little longer on the magnet before pouring and the small amount of fluid that remains has to be aspirated away but, overall, it means less time on the magnet and without fluid. In this way, it is possible to do 24 or more extractions quickly.\nBlock with 200 µL bead buffer, 10 µL 20 mg/mL glycogen, and 2.5 µL 5 mg/mL tRNA, 20 min rotating end over end at moderate speed at RT. The rotation is to keep the beads in suspension. Once the blocking is complete remove the fluid as steps 4.7.2−4.7.4 and wash again, as the steps in section 4.7.\nResuspend the beads in the sample. Incubate at RT with rotation for 30 min.\nDuring the incubation, prepare a fresh 1.5 mL tube for each sample. Add 1/10 volume (approximately 10 µL) of 3 M sodium acetate pH 5.3 and 20 µg of glycogen, and spin at approximately 100 x g for 3 s. Store in a rack until needed.\nRemove the unbound RNA from the beads, as steps 4.7.2−4.7.4. The unbound RNA can be persevered in a fresh tube, but the salts and SDS make it very difficult to purify. Then wash the beads, as section 4.7 with vortexing, for a minimum of 3 to a maximum of 5 times.\nAfter the final wash take special care to aspirate all the liquid; return to each tube and aspirate the dregs of the buffer once more.",
    "To elute the RNA, add 50 µL of freshly prepared 0.7 M β-mercaptoethanol (βME) to the beads (1/20 dilution of the commercially supplied stock solution). Vortex and spin briefly, as steps 4.7.1 and 4.7.2. Place the slurry in the magnetic rack and pipette the RNA containing solution into the 1.5 mL centrifuge tube prepared in step 4.10.\nElute once more as step 4.13 to recover residual RNA from the beads and add the eluted sample to the tube containing the first elution from these beads.\nRemove residual beads from the eluted RNA by placing the sample back in the magnetic rack and transferring the fluid to a fresh, low binding 0.5 mL centrifuge tube.\nMix the sample and then precipitate the nsRNA by adding 2.5x volumes (280 µL) of ethanol and mix once more. Leave for 1 h to overnight at -20 °C. Spin in a pre-chilled centrifuge (4 °C) for 20 min at the maximum speed (at least 13,000 x g).\nWash thoroughly with 200 µL of 70% ethanol at -20 °C. As residual βME will inhibit downstream applications, spin at every step to remove as much of the dregs as possible; at the end the sample should not smell of βME.\nRe-dissolve in 10−20 µL of DEPC-treated 1x TE with the equivalent of 0.005 µL RNase inhibitor.\n\tNOTE: All subsequent stages should be performed on ice.\nMeasure the RNA concentration and purity.\n\t\nMeasure the A260 and A225 in a low sample volume spectrophotometer.\n\t\tNOTE: An absorbance maximum near λ = 225 nm is from an unavoidable contaminant from the beads. In the absence of RNA the signal from the contaminant declines to 35% at λ = 260 nm. Therefore, the actual amount of RNA is approximated by the formula: (A260-(A225*0.35))*40 ng/µL.",
    "Alternatively, analyze the sample on a micro-fluidics electrophoresis system such as a bioanalyzer.\n\t\tNOTE: This analysis is preferable to using a spectrophotometer as RNA integrity can be assessed, the contaminant does not interfere with the quantitation and less sample is required.\nAnalyze the nsRNA.\n\tNOTE: For example, specific RNAs can be quantified by standard reverse transcriptase qPCR techniques. RNA prepared this way is compatible with library preparation for RNA-seq. Removal of rRNA is not necessary for labelling times of less than 5 min. Recoding SLAMseq14 can also be performed on this RNA."
