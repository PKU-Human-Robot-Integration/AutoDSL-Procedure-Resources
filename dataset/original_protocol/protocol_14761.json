    "Before starting any procedures with live animals, experimental protocols should be approved by the institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC).\n1. Scanner Configuration\nBefore starting, make sure the heater is in OFF position.\nSelect the mini imaging gradient and 38 mm RF coil and mini imaging holder.\nIn the central bore of the holder install the variable temperature assembly.\n2. Animal Preparation\nFor MRI experiments, achieve optimal anesthesia using vaporized isoflurane. For induction of anesthesia, place animal in an induction chamber lined with an absorbent tissue. Adjust the flowmeter of the isoflurane vaporizer to 2.0-2.5 L/min, and the isoflurane to 3% in oxygen.\nRemove any metal tag or other metallic object at this stage. Apply vet ointment on animal’s eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nOnce the animal has reached the surgical plane of anesthesia (i.e., loss of withdrawal reflex to toe pinch), place the animal on a holder with its nose inserted into a nose cone. Set the anesthesia air flow in the probe to 2.0-2.5 ml/min and the isoflurane concentration to 1.5-2.0% in oxygen. Anesthesia will be delivered through the nose cone during the procedure. Periodically adjust isoflurane concentration depending on animal’s age and weight to maintain a respiration rate of ~40 bpm.\nUse animal holders to secure the animal in place and prevent motion during the MRI experiment. Vary the type of animal holder depending on the body region to be scanned.\n\tNote: Customized holders from laboratory plastics (polypropylene, Teflon, polystyrene, polycarbonate) can be made to accommodate specific experiment and to fit the animal size (from newborn mouse to 160 g rat).",
    "Place the rectal thermometer in the animal to monitor animal’s body temperature. During the experiment, keep the animal at 35-37 °C, using a stream of warm air. Adjust air temperature (30-38 °C) and flow (1,200-2,000 L/hr) based on animal’s body temperature feedback.\nAttach a balloon respiratory pressure sensor to animal’s abdomen to monitor respiration rate.\nSecure the animal at the center of the RF coil and carefully place the RF coil with animal into MRI scanner.\n3. MRI Experiment\nTune and match the RF coil before starting the experiments to minimize RF power used and to maximize signal-to-noise ratio. To start the matching/tuning:\n\t\nOpen the spectrometer control tool by clicking the tools icon.\nIn the spectrometer control tool click Acquisition → Wobble. An Acq/Reco window will open displaying the wobble curve.\nAlternatively adjust the tuning and matching capacitors (using the tuning and matching rods) in small steps until the reflected RF power is minimized. The goal is to see a curve with a minimum at the vertical axis positioned at zero on the horizontal axis.\nWhen the calibration of the coil has been successfully achieved, hit the Stop button in the Acq/Reco window.\nAcquire scout images in the three orthogonal planes to create axial, coronal and sagittal images. Use a fast image sequence such as Intra Gate Fast Low Angle Shot (IG-FLASH) to acquire the scout images12. Use the scout images to set the proper geometry for the actual imaging.\nDepending on the specific research aims, select proper image sequence and parameters and start the scan with a traffic light. This will calibrate RF channel, shim the magnet, set carrier frequency on-resonance for water and adjust receiver gain, all automatically.",
    "For anatomic studies and T2 weighted images, acquire in 2D multi slice or 3D mode. To shorten the experiment time for a given spatial resolution, keep the field-of-view (FOV) as small as possible but large enough to avoid wrap-around artifacts (2.56-3.2 cm).\nKeep the cycle of selected sequence slightly shorter than the animal respiration cycle by proper selection of repetition time (TR) and/or number of slices. This ensures that the data are collected during animals' quiet period.\n\t\nFor example, for abdominal images, keep animal’s respiratory rate at ~30 bpm; that is about 2,000 msec per breath. Use a Turbo Rapid Acquisition with Relaxation Enhancement (RARE) sequence and acquire 11-19 coronal slices, with TR/TE 1500/9 msec, RARE factor 8 and (matrix 256 x 256, FOV 2.56 x 2.56 cm, slice thickness 0.75 mm).\n\t\tNote: By adjusting the TR to 1,500 msec, and keeping the animal’s respiratory rate ~30 bpm (2,000 msec per breath), we ensure that the data are collected during animals' quiet period.\nAfter all image acquisition has been completed, place the scanned animal on heated pad and monitor until ambulatory. After recovery, return the animal to the cage and monitored at least for 1 hr before returning to the animal facility.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
