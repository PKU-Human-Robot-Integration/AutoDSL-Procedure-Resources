    "All methods described here have been part of the studies approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Gothenburg, Sweden (318-04, 225-08).\n1. Setting up the Motion Capture System\nMount 4 cameras on the wall approximately 1.5 - 3 m away from the measurement area at the height of 1.5 - 2.5 m facing the measurement area. Mount one camera on ceiling just above the measurement area (Figure 1). Start the camera system.\nPlace the L-shape calibration frame on the table with the short axis in line with the edge of the table and the long axis pointing forward.\n\tNOTE: The coordinate system is defined with X-axes directed forward (anteriorly in the sagittal plane), Y-axis directed laterally (in the frontal plane), and Z-axis directed upward (superiorly, perpendicular to the transversal plane).\nOpen the 3D tracking and data acquisition software (Track Manager), start calibration by selecting Capture | Calibrate, enter the calibration time of 30 s and click OK.\nMove the wand in all directions throughout the entire measurement area (75 × 75 × 65 cm) above the chair and table to ensure that all 5 cameras capture the wand in as many orientations as possible16,17. After the calibration, the results show on the screen. Accept calibration residuals below 0.5 mm.\nHave the subject, wearing a sleeveless top, sit in a in a height adjustable chair with their back against the chair´s back, the upper arm in neutral adducted position, the palm of the hand resting at the table and the wrist aligned to the edge of the table. Check that the knee, hip, and elbow angles are approximately 90°.",
    "Place the retroreflective passive markers with double-adhesive tape on the skeletal landmarks18 on the tested hand (third metacarpophalangeal joint), wrist (styloid process of ulna), elbow (lateral epicondyle), right and left shoulder (middle part of acromion), thorax (upper part of sternum), and forehead (notch between eyebrows).\nPlace two markers on the cup (upper and lower edge).\n2. Procedures for Motion Capture of the Drinking Task\nPlace the hard-plastic cup (diameter of 7 cm, height of 9.5 cm) with 100 mL of water 30 cm from the table edge, in the midline of the body. The position of cup on the table is selected deliberately to keep the task performance natural and close to real-life situation.\nAsk the subject to perform the drinking task in a comfortable self-paced speed by i) reaching and grasping the cup, ii) lifting the cup from the table towards mouth, iii) taking a drink (one sip), iv) placing the cup back on the table behind a marked line (30 cm from the table edge), and v) returning to the initial position with the hand on the edge of the table.\nEnsure that subject understands the instructions and can reach the cup comfortably with the less-affected arm without leaning forward.\nPrior each recording, ensure that the start position (initial position) is correct, ask the subject to be ready, start the capture manually and give verbal instruction \"you can start now.\"\nWhen the subject finishes the task, stop the recording manually.\nRecord five trials with short pause between each trial (approximately 30 s), starting with the less-affected arm.\nCheck that the data acquisition has been successful (95 - 100% data for each identified marker).",
    "NOTE: Marker data is automatically transferred in real-time to the data acquisition software (Track Manager). A pre-defined Automatic Marker Identification (AIM) model is used for automatic identification of the markers.\nWhen incomplete data are detected, perform extra trials after identifying the problem and adjusting the sitting or marker positions to ensure full visibility of the markers in order to obtain at least 3 successful trials.\n\tNOTE: Possible problems that may occur are that markers may fall off or they are occluded from the cameras viewing angle, which results in incomplete data. However, the camera and marker set-up, as used in this protocol, produces data loss due to gaps only in very rare occasions. In total, the motion capture session takes approximately 10 - 15 min to complete.\n3. Data Analysis\nTransfer the recorded data from Track Manager directly into Matlab by clicking File | Export | Directly into Matlab.\nUse the Matlab command at the command prompt: (>> workspace) to see the set of Matlab variables.\n\tNOTE: Key Matlab variables containing data to be used in the instructions and in creating the analysis are:\n\tQTMmeasurements.Frames - the number of frames captured\n\tQTMmeasurements.FrameRate - the number of frames captured per second (240)\n\tQTMmeasurements.Trajectories.Labeled.Count - number of labels (10)\n\tQTMmeasurements.Trajectories.Labeled.Labels - labels as defined in the Track Manager\n\tQTMmeasurements.Trajectories.Labeled.Data - measurement data in a 3D array of 10 x 3 x number of frames, where for each frame and each label the 3 coordinates are recorded\nIn Matlab, filter the x, y, z values using the (butter) and (filtfilt) instructions with a 6Hz second-order Butterworth filter in in both forward and reverse directions, giving a zero-phase distortion and forth-order filtering.\n\tNOTE: Example\n\t[b, a] = butter(2, 6/240/2); % Cutoff frequency 6Hz and with respect to ½ sampling frequency",
    "xfiltered = filtfilt(b, a, QTMmeasurements.Trajectories.Labeled(1,1,:));\nIn Matlab, create a program to use the x, y, z values for each frame sample and each label to calculate the kinematic variables such as tangential velocity of the hand, and joint angles. The kinematic variables are shown in Table 2.\nIn Matlab, create a program to break the sequence of samples into 5 logical phases: reaching, forward transport, drinking, back transport, and returning the hand to the initial position (Figure 2). Definitions for start and end of each phase are showed in detail in Table 1.\nIn Matlab, use the (plot) instruction to create plots of positions, velocities, joints angles, and angle-angle diagrams.\nSubscription Required.
