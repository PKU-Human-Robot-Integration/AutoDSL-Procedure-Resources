The following describes\n      the preparation of HH-HSC, CS, CSF, and CSFE spheroids from culture plates\n      as they are combined to form a seed culture.\n    \nRemove culture media from cells in cell culture plates.\nWash each plate with 7 mL of PBS and remove.\nAdd 2 mL of 0.25% trypsin/EDTA to each plate.\nIncubate at 37°C for 3–5 min, until fully detached.\n        Add 8 mL of complete media to each plate to neutralize trypsin. Collect\n        cell suspensions in individual 15 mL conical tubes.\n      \nCentrifuge cell suspensions for 5 min at 300 × g and 4°C.\n        Remove and discard supernatant and resuspend cell pellets in 2 mL of\n        respective complete media by gently pipetting up and down.\n      \n        Combine 10 μL of resuspended cell solution with 10 μL of trypan blue for\n        a total of 20 μL.\n      \n        Pipette 10 μL of the solution from step 8 onto a cell counting chamber\n        slide and count cells using an automated cell counter.\n      \nAlternatives: Count using a manual\n      hemocytometer.\n    \n        Preparation of seed cultures.\n        \n            HH-HSC or CS spheroids.\n            \n                Required cell numbers 1 × 105 for HH or cancer cells\n                and for 4 × 104 LX2 cells.\n              \n                Combine HH with LX2 cells and combine cancer cells with LX2\n                cells in individual 1.5 mL tubes with a volume of 500–600 μL.\n              \n            HH-SF or CSF spheroids.\n            \n                Required cell numbers 1 × 105 for HH or cancer cells\n                and 4 × 104 for LX2 and HDF cells.\n              \n                Combine HH or cancer cells with LX2 and HDF cells in a 1.5 mL\n                tube with 500–600 μL media.\n              \n            HH-SFE or CSFE spheroids.",

Thus, machines\n      such as a random positioning machine (RPM) or a low-speed tissue culture\n      rotator can be used. When rotating strictly around a single horizontal\n      axis, samples should be placed as close to the center axis as feasible to\n      induce a simulated microgravity effect and avoid centrifugal forces.\n    \nSet the clinostat to 18 RPM and allow it to run for 90 min.\nCritical: A low speed of rotation is\n      critical for the reduction of gravitational forces by averaging out these\n      forces without inducing centrifugal forces that could lead to aggregation.\n      Depending on the device and the diameter of the cell vessel that is used,\n      the speed or rotation can range from 8-40 RPM. The residual gravity force\n      can be calculated and RPMs adjusted as needed, using the formula a = ω2",

For\n      validation of spheroid quality refer to “Image and analysis of spheroids”\n      section.\n    \nCritical: Ensure that cells remain\n      well suspended after vortexing. If cell aggregation occurs and cells are\n      allowed to settle at this step only a small number of spheroids will form.\n    \n        Fill tubes completely with mixed media and return to the clinostat.\n      \nSet clinostat to 18 RPM and allow to run 15–18 h.\nExpansion and maintenance of spheroid cultures\nTiming: 0.5 h\n      The purpose of this step is to promote the growth of a large number of\n      spheroids by increasing the available growth area and nutrients. Upon\n      completion the spheroids have developed for 72 h and can be used for\n      experiments as desired or continue to be maintained in culture.\n    \nRemove tubes from the clinostat.\nNote: For validation of spheroid quality\n      refer to “Image and analysis of spheroids” section.\n    \n        Using sterilized scissors cut the top of 200 μL pipette tips and\n        transfer spheroids into 1.5 mL tubes and fill them completely with\n        appropriate media.\n      \nCritical: Cutting pipette tips\n      increases the opening diameter which allows for spheroids to be\n      transferred without causing physical disruption.\n    \n        Return tubes to the clinostat at 18 RPM and allow it to run for 24 h.\n      \nMaintenance\nRemove tubes from the clinostat.\n        In the sterile cell culture hood place samples in a tube holder.

Spheroids can be retrieved from the\n      tubes at any time for assessments of total count, viability, or\n      immunohistochemical testing. A simple bar clamp could be used to grasp the\n      end of the tube (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\n    \nAlternatives: Locking wrench,\n      locking pliers, or tape. In general, any tool that can secure the tube\n      over the objective can be used to produce a stable image.\n    \n        Position the tube over the objective and acquired desired images (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\n      \nNote: The spheroids at this stage are\n      prone to clumping together. To help mitigate this, it is recommended to\n      always keep tubes laid out parallel to the surface of the work area. If\n      multiple tubes are being imaged at the same time, consider splitting up\n      the tubes into two working groups.",
