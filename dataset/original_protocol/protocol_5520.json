    "Sampling and washing (Figure 1)Notes: Keep samples on ice to slow down the metabolic activity.The washing steps are time sensitive since they stop the experiment by removing all external Mn. Removing all external Mn conserves the sample in the state of the timepoint it was taken and the elemental composition of the sample cannot change anymore. Sample volumes and final elution volumes are accounted for in the calculation under data analysis. All volumes in this protocol are therefore approximate volumes, as long as they are weighted accurately. All transfers can be done by pouring. Pipetting is not necessary and may even add contaminants.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171127/20171127174730_6952.jpgFigure 1. Workflow for sampling and washing. A. Intracellular (sample C) and periplasmic (samples E1 and E2) Mn pools are separated by EDTA washing steps. B. To measure the total cellular Mn content (sample T), cells are separated from the medium and resuspended in Milli-Q water.For each sample, prepare four 15 ml test tubes, labeled with sample number and T1 (total cell), E1 (first EDTA wash), E2 (second EDTA wash) and C1 (intracellular Mn content), respectively.Weigh and note the weight of each test tube, including cap.Take 2 ml samples (OD750 ~0.75, Note 3) and transfer them into tubes T1 and C1 (Note 4). Remove 30 µl from tube T1 for cell counting.Weigh and note the weight of tubes T1 and C1.Note: Subtracting the weight of the empty tube from that of the tube with sample gives you the weight of the sample.Centrifuge tubes T1 and C1 at 3,000 x g and 4 °C for 5 min. Discard the supernatant.Note: The supernatant can be analyzed as sample M (medium) if wanted. If so, weigh the sample before filtering it through a 0.2 µm syringe filter to get rid of remaining cells.",
    "The growth of remaining cells would change the Mn composition of the medium and require sample digestion. After filtering, the sample does not need further processing.Resuspend samples T1 by vortexing in approximately 4 ml of Milli-Q water. Store the samples at room temperature until sample digestion.Add 4 ml EDTA wash buffer to samples C and resuspend by vortexing. Repeat step 1f.Transfer the EDTA supernatant to the test tube labeled E1. Weigh and note the weight. Store tube E1 at room temperature. The sample does not need further processing (Note 5).Note: Most ICP-MS facilities do not accept undigested or unfiltered samples. Therefore, it may be necessary to filter the EDTA washes as described above. However, potentially remaining cells cannot grow, since they are in EDTA wash buffer and not medium.Add 4 ml EDTA wash buffer to samples C and resuspend by vortexing. Repeat step 1f.Transfer the EDTA supernatant to the test tube labeled E2. Weigh and note the weight. Store tube E2 at room temperature. The sample does not need further processing.Add 4 ml Milli-Q water and resuspend by vortexing.Remove 30 µl from the tube for cell counting.Sample digestion Note: From here on, it is essential to carry out all steps in clean room conditions. For each sample, prepare another set of two 15 ml test tubes (label with sample number and C2 or T2).Weigh out 4 ml of Milli-Q water to the test tubes C2 and T2Add 2 ml of nitric acid to each of samples T1 and C1.Gently shake or invert for 5 min.Preheat a hot plate in a chemical hood to 200 °C (Note 6).Place each sample (T1 and C1 only) into Teflon cups suitable for the hot plate and place the samples on the hot plate.",
    "Let the samples evaporate until minimal droplet remains; remove from the hot plate before sample evaporates completely (Note 7).Add all water from corresponding test tube to the Teflon cup, re-suspend the sample carefully and return the sample to the same test tube (e.g., water from tube T2 to the evaporated sample T and back to tube T2).Sample measurement (clean room not required)Transfer 2 ml from each sample (T2, C2, E1, and E2) to appropriate sample tubes for the ICP-MS sample handler.Store the remaining 2 ml of each sample for potential extra measurements.Analyze the samples according to the instructions of your ICP-MS facility.Cell countingPerform cell counting on the samples from sampling and washing (steps 1d and 1n) according to the instructions manual of your hemocytometer."
