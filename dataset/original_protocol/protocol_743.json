    "1. Transfer 500 µL of serum or plasma  equilibrated to room temperature into a 1.5 mL microfuge tube.\n  2.  Add 500 µL XBP stored at room temperature.\n  3. Invert 5 times.\n  4.  Add 800 µL of sample/XBP mixture onto the exoEasy spin column and centrifuge for 1 minute at 500 x g at room temperature.\n  5. Repeat step 4 until all mixture is added onto the column.\n  6.  Discard flow-through.\n  7.  Add 800 µL XWP to the exoEasy spin column.\n  8.  Centrifuge for 5 minutes at 5,000 x g at room temperature.\n  9.  Transfer the spin column to a fresh collection tube.\n  10.  Add 700 µL Qiazol to the membrane of the spin column.\n  11.  Centrifuge for 5 minutes at 5,000 x g at room temperature.\n  12.  Transfer the flow-though, which is the lysate, to a PLG tube.<sup>1</sup>\n  13.  Vortex for 5 seconds.\n  14.  Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes.\n  15.  Add 90 µL chloroform.\n  16.  Shake vigorously for 15 seconds.\n  17.  Incubate for 3 min at room temperature.\n  18.  Centrifuge sample for 5 min at 12,000 x g at 4°C.\n  19.  Transfer the upper aqueous phase to a new microcentrifuge tube. \n  20.  Carefully measure the aqueous phase and add 2 volumes of 100% ethanol.\n  21.  Mix gently and thoroughly. Do not centrifuge and do not delay moving on to the next step.\n  22.  Assemble a MinElute spin column in a new collection tube.\n  23.  Load up to 700 µL of the mixture from Step 21, including any precipitate that may have formed, onto the column. \n  24.  Centrifuge for 15 seconds at 1,000 x g at room temperature.<sup>2</sup> \n  25.  Discard flow-through.\n  26.  Repeat steps 23-25 until entire sample has been loaded.\n  27. Make sure that ethanol has been added to RWT and RPE buffers.",
    "28. Add 700 μL Buffer RWT to the RNeasy MinElute spin column. \n  29.  Centrifuge for 15 seconds at ≥ 8000 x g at room temperature to wash the column. \n  30.  Discard the flow-through.\n  31.  Pipet 500 μL Buffer RPE onto the RNeasy MinElute spin column. \n  32. Centrifuge for 15 seconds at ≥ 8000 x g to wash the column. \n  33.  Discard the flow-through.\n  34.  Pipet 500 μL Buffer RPE onto the RNeasy MinElute spin column. \n  35.  Centrifuge for 2 minutes at ≥ 8000 x g \\(≥10,000 rpm) at room temperature to wash the column. \n  36.  Discard the collection tube with the flow-through.<sup>3</sup>\n  37.  Transfer the RNeasy MinElute spin column into a new 2 mLcollection tube \\(supplied). \n  38.  Open the lid of the spin column, and centrifuge at full speed \\(14,000 x g) for 5 min to dry the membrane.<sup>4</sup> \n  39.  Discard the collection tube with the flow-through. \n  40.  Transfer the RNeasy MinElute spin column in a new 1.5 mL collection tube \\(supplied). Add 30 μL RNase-free water directly to the center of the spin column membrane.<sup>5</sup>\n  41. Centrifuge for 1 min at full speed to elute the RNA \\(Optional: Centrifuge for 1 min at 100 x g followed by 1 min at full speed).<sup>6</sup>"
