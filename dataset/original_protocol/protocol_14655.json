    "1. Preparing Mix Culture Containing Both Tumor Cells and Non-tumor Cells\nUse tumor cells from an established cell line MPNST S4625. Use fibroblasts as the non-tumor cells6,7\nCulture both tumor cells and fibroblasts in standard DMEM medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (BSA), 3 mM glutamine, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 500 U/ml penicillin, 500 g/ml streptomycin and 1 mM sodium pyruvate at 37 °C and 5% CO25-7. At sub-confluence, harvest the cells with 0.05% trypsin and count them using a hemocytometer.\nMix 400 tumor cells and 1,600 non-tumor cells together in each well of a 96-well culture plate in 0.2 ml medium. Considering faster growth of tumor cells over the treatment period of 5 days, the initial proportion of tumor cells was set at 25%. Set up 4 replicates for each drug concentration. Incubate the cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2 O/N.\n2. Drug Treatment\nUse nilotinib as the test drug. Prepare stock solutions of 0, 2, 4 and 20 mM nilotinib in DMSO. Dilute each of them by 200-fold in 5 ml DMEM medium, giving 2-fold concentrated drug-solutions of 0, 10, 20 and 100 µM6.7.\nRemove 0.1 ml medium from each well and add 0.1 ml of medium containing drug. The final concentrations are 0, 5, 10 and 50 µM. Continue incubating the cells in medium containing drug for 5 days.\nAt the end of the treatment, inspect the attached cells using a phase-contrast microscope and take photos. Aspirate the medium away, wash the survived adhesive cells once with 0.2 ml PBS.\n3. Preparing DNA for Digital PCR\nLyse cells using HotShot8.",
    "Add 50 µl alkaline lysis solution (25 mM NaOH, 0.2 mM EDTA) to each well. Seal the wells with foil. Incubate the plate at 95 °C in an oven or on a heating plate for 30 min. Check under a microscope to make sure that no more intact cells remained at the surface of the wells. In case the cells did not lyse completely, increase the heating time or add detergent. Freeze them once at -20 °C also enhances breaking cells.\nAdd 50 µl neutralizing solution (40 mM Tris-HC, pH 4.0) to each well. Transfer all lysates into U-form wells of a PCR plate and dry in a PCR cycler at 95 °C for 10 to 30 min. Reconstitute the lysates with 20 µl distilled water.\nDesalt using Drop-Dialysis9\nuse membrane filters with mean pore size 0.025 µm.\nFloat the filter on distilled water with shiny side up in wells of a 12-well plate. Wet the filter for 5 min. Pay attention to avoid air bubbles between the filter and water.\nPipet the reconstituted lysates of each sample from step 3.1.4 carefully onto on each of the 4 areas of the filter. Cover the plate and dialyze for 30 to 60 min.\nSuck away the water under the filter without flipping over the filter nor disturbing the drops.\nTransfer the lysate-drops into wells of a new PCR-plate. Dry the DNA-drops by heating at 95 °C for 10 to 30 min in a PCR cycler. Reconstitute the lysates in 10 µl water.\n4. Digital PCR\nThaw frozen components such as DNA, buffer and the assay mix at RT, spin down for 10 sec at maximum force of any available centrifuge (for example, VWR mini centrifuge) and then keep them on ice.",
    "Prepare master mixture containing all components except DNA (Table 1). Consider dead volume and calculate master mixture approximately 10% more than the required amount.\n\tNOTE: Use the primers and probes used in the commercial kit.\nVortex the master mixture, spin down for 10 sec at maximum force of any available centrifuge (for example, VWR mini centrifuge) and dispense 15 µl to each well of a 96-PCR plate. Add all lysate (which contains DNA) of each sample to the wells containing the master mixture. Transfer 20 µl of each reaction mixture into a well on the sample side of a cartridge at RT.\nDispense 70 µl of droplet generator oil into each well on the oil side of a cartridge. Close the cartridge with the gasket and place the whole setting into a droplet generator. Start droplet generation.\nTransfer 40 µl droplet-solution into wells of a 96-well PCR plate. Seal the plate with a foil and place the plate into a PCR cycler. Set the lid-temperature at 105 °C and ramp rate at 2 °C/sec. Carry out PCR using the settings in Table 2. After the PCR, transfer the plate into a droplet reader and start reading. Alternatively, store the plate at 4 °C for up to 24 hr.\n5. Calculating Proportion of Tumor Cells\nLoad the digital PCR data and perform automatic analysis.\nControl the results of each assay manually by inspecting the one-dimensional and 2-dimensional distribution of the positive and negative droplets, and sure that they are well separated and the threshold lines were in the right positions. Exclude results not meeting the criteria, for example, no clear separation of positive and negative droplets, from further analysis. Copy the resulting ratio NF1/RPP30 into an excel sheet.\nCalculate the proportion of tumor cells as: 2 x (1- NF1/RPP30).",
    "6. Dose-dependent Change of Proportion of Tumor Cells\nFor each drug-concentration, calculate the mean and standard deviation from the 4 replicates. Plot the means and the standard deviations against drug-concentrations."
