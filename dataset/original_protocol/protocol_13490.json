    "This study was performed at the Laboratory for Animal Science of Hannover Medical School after approval by the Lower Saxony regional authority for consumer protection and food safety (Niedersächsisches Landesamt für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit [LAVES]; 19/3146)\n1. Donor liver procurement\nNOTE: The liver donors were female domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus), aged 4-5 months old and with an average body weight of approximately 50 kg, which had already been in quarantine at the animal research facility for a minimum of 10 days prior to surgery.\nPerform premedication by intramuscular injection of atropine (0.04-0.08 mg/kg body weight), zolazepam (5 mg/kg body weight), and tiletamine (5 mg/kg body weight). After establishing an intravenous access (e.g., ear vein) induce anesthesia with an injection of propofol (1.5 - 2.5 mg/kg body weight).\nPerform intubation with an 8.0-8.5 mm endotracheal tube, depending on the animal size and anatomy. Establish monitoring of electrocardiography, measurement of respiratory gases and peripheral oxygen saturation, and non-invasive blood pressure measurement.\nMaintain anesthesia in pigs during donor liver procurement via inhalation of isoflurane (0.8-1.5 vol%) and intravenous application of fentanyl (0.003-0.007 mg/kg body weight). Perform volume-controlled ventilation throughout the procedure.\nAfter placement of the donor pig in a supine position and fixation of the limbs at the base of the operation table with elastic bands, scrub the skin with antiseptic agent, e.g., povidone-iodine or isopropyl alcohol, and cover the animal with sterile drapes.\nConfirm an adequate depth of anesthesia by loss of the withdrawal response to toe pinch. Perform a midline laparotomy beginning at the xiphoid process by using monopolar cautery. Place an abdominal retractor and mobilize the intestine to the right of the donor.",
    "Perform a splenectomy by dissection of the splenocolic ligament, the gastrosplenic ligament, and the phrenicosplenic ligament. Clamp the splenic vein and splenic artery near the splenic hilum with an Overholt clamp and place ligatures (3-0 polyfilament suture) after severing the vessels. Sever additional (smaller) vessels either by bipolar forceps or by ligation.\n\tNOTE: A splenectomy during donor liver procurement is not obligatory but reduces the efflux of blood during and after perfusion.\nMobilize the intestine to the left side of the donor and sever the falciform ligament and the triangular ligaments using scissors and bipolar cautery.\nAfter sufficient dissection of the liver, incise the left portion of the diaphragm over a distance of 5-10 cm using scissors to locate the thoracic segment of the descending aorta. Encircle and place a ligature (3-0 polyfilament suture) without tightening.\nIncise the right portion of the diaphragm over a distance of 5-10 cm using scissors and identify the suprahepatic vena cava inferior.\nRelocate the intestine to the upper left of the donor and enter the retroperitoneal space by transverse incision of the peritoneum over a distance of 5-10 cm using scissors.\nLocate the abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava just above the iliac bifurcation and separate both vessels over a length of approximately 6 cm. Place two 3-0 polyfilament ligatures around the abdominal aorta: one cranial of the iliac bifurcation and one approximately 3 cm cranially, without tightening. Place another ligature around the intrahepatic vena cava inferior without tightening.\nIntravenously inject heparin (25,000 I.E.). Choose an appropriate cannula and de-air the drip line with cooled preservation solution.",
    "Tighten the caudally located first ligature around the abdominal aorta. After occluding the abdominal aorta cranially of the second ligature (either manually or by placing an atraumatic vascular clamp), make a transverse incision between both the ligatures using scissors.\nInsert the cannula into the incision and secure it with the remaining ligature. Sever the suprahepatic inferior vena cava far cranially (close to the right atrium) using scissors.\nAfter blood loss of approximately 1,500-2,000 mL, cross-clamp the thoracic segment of the descending aorta by tying the ligature and start antegrade perfusion.\n\tNOTE: For the possible need for blood (transfusions) during engraftment or for normothermic machine perfusion, whole blood (approximately 1,500 mL) can be collected using a container containing citrate-based anticoagulant.\nTighten the ligature placed around the infrahepatic vena cava inferior, incise the vessel cranially of the ligature, and insert a surgical aspirator. Inject a lethal dose of pentobarbital sodium (5,000 mg). Place crushed sterile ice into the thoracic and abdominal cavity without compromising the liver tissue.\nAfter perfusion with 3,500 mL of preservation solution over a course of approximately 10-15 min, sever the incised suprahepatic vena cava inferior. Sever the infrahepatic vena cava inferior at the level of the left renal vein.\nSever the bile duct cranial of the pancreatic tissue between two ligatures (3-0 polyfilament) to avoid bile spillage. Sever the portal vein cranial of the pancreas.\nLocate the celiac artery after blunt preparation and follow dorsally to the abdominal aorta. Excise the respective aortic segment in order to create a patch for later engraftment.\nExcise the diaphragm around the suprahepatic vena cava inferior and sever remaining adhesions using scissors. Extract the liver.",
    "Perform a cholecystectomy or tighten a ligature around the cystic duct and flush the common bile duct with at least 20 mL of preservation solution. Place the perfusion cannula into the portal vein and flush the graft with a further 500 mL of preservation solution. Place the graft in a sterile bowl placed on ice.\n\t​NOTE: Depending on the scientific objective, the organ can be immediately prepared for engraftment or kept on ice for an indefinite amount of time (20 h in this protocol) before beginning back-table preparation and engraftment.\n2. Back-table preparation of the liver\nRemove the lymphatic tissue beginning at the aortic segment and thereby identify and occlude the arterial side branches and lymphatic vessels with either clips, ligatures (4-0 polyfilament), or sutures (5-0 monofilament; Figure 1A). Likewise, remove the lymphatic tissue around the portal vein and occlude the side branches with sutures (5-0 monofilament).\nIdentify the suprahepatic vena cava inferior and place sutures around both diaphragmatic veins (5-0 monofilament) after removing surrounding diaphragmatic tissue. Flush all the vessels with cold saline or preservation solution to identify any remaining leakages. Perform shortening of the vessels and preparation of the aortic patch only upon engraftment to take into account the individual anatomic circumstances.\n3. Recipient hepatectomy, donor liver engraftment, and perioperative management\nNOTE: As liver recipients, female domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) aged 4-5 months old and with an average body weight of approximately 50 kg, were used. Analogously to the liver donors, the recipients had been in quarantine at the animal research facility for a minimum of 10 days prior to transplant.\nAnesthesia and perioperative management",
    "Perform premedication by intramuscular injection of atropine (0.04-0.08 mg/kg body weight), zolazepam (5 mg/kg body weight), and tiletamine (5 mg/kg body weight). After establishing an intravenous access (e.g., ear vein), induce anesthesia with an injection of propofol (1.5-2.5 mg/kg body weight).\nPerform intubation with an 8.0-8.5 mm endotracheal tube, depending on the animal size and anatomy. Establish monitoring of electrocardiography, measurement of respiratory gases and peripheral oxygen saturation, and non-invasive blood pressure measurement. In the case of a chronic model, apply eye ointment to avoid dryness after the surgical intervention.\nPlace the recipient animal on a heating base in a supine position and fix the limbs on the base of the operation table with elastic bands.\nFor extended monitoring, under ultrasound guidance, place a three-lumen central venous catheter and a large-bore venous catheter (7 Fr.) into the internal jugular vein and a large-bore venous catheter (7 Fr.) for volume therapy. In addition, insert an arterial catheter into the internal carotid/cervical artery under ultrasound control for invasive blood pressure measurement (Figure 1B).\nMaintain anesthesia during organ retrieval via inhalation of isoflurane (0.8-1.5 vol%) and intravenous application of fentanyl (0.003-0.007 mg/kg body weight). Perform volume-controlled ventilation throughout the procedure. Apply 2,000 mg of sultamicillin for perioperative antibiosis and 250 mg of methylprednisolone intravenously. \nAdminister a vasopressor such as norepinephrine intravenously to achieve a target mean arterial pressure of 60 mmHg. In addition, apply crystalloid solutions such as Ringer's lactate solution or colloid solutions such as fluid gelatins if necessary.\nApply calcium gluconate (10%) and sodium bicarbonate (8.4%), glucose (40%), or potassium chloride (7.45%) intravenously with respect to blood gas analyses obtained every 30 min.\nRecipient hepatectomy\n\t\nScrub the skin with antiseptic agent, e.g., povidone-iodine or isopropyl alcohol, and cover the animal with sterile drapes.",
    "Confirm an adequate depth of anesthesia by loss of the withdrawal response to toe pinch. Perform a midline laparotomy beginning at the xiphoid process by using monopolar cautery. Place an abdominal retractor and mobilize the intestine to the left of the donor. Cover the intestine with a moistened cloth.\nPlace a suprapubic urinary catheter for the optimization of intraoperative volume management.\nSever the falciform ligament and the triangular ligaments using scissors and bipolar cautery. After sufficient dissection of the liver, encircle both the suprahepatic and infrahepatic vena cavae inferior close to the liver parenchyma.\nDissect and sever the common bile duct below the junction of the cystic duct between two ligatures (3-0 polyfilament).\nIncise the superficial peritoneal layer covering the hepatoduodenal ligament and identify the hepatic arteries shortly before entering the liver parenchyma. Dissect using bipolar cautery or the placement of clips, ligatures, or sutures.\nDissect the abdominal aorta by incision in the midline (avascular layer) of the right and left diaphragmatic muscles. Prepare the aorta for the aortic anastomosis by removal of the surrounding tissue.\n\t\tNOTE: This step only is required if an aortic anastomosis is performed. Otherwise, further dissect the hepatic artery/the hilar region to prepare for a conventional end-to-end anastomosis between the donor and recipient hepatic arteries.\nPerform recipient hepatectomy by placing an atraumatic vascular clamp on the portal vein, followed by atraumatic vascular clamps on the suprahepatic vena cava inferior (including the surrounding diaphragm while caudally retracting the liver) and the infrahepatic vena cava inferior.\nSever all three vessels close to the liver parenchyma. Remove the recipient liver from the abdominal cavity.",
    "NOTE: The clamping of the vessels marks the start of the anhepatic phase. During the anhepatic phase, the pigs are hemodynamically instable and require relevant amounts of vasopressors/catecholamines. The anesthesiologist should be prepared to apply norepinephrine and epinephrine. Keep the phase until reperfusion of the liver as short as possible. Communicate well with the anesthesiologist.\nDonor liver engraftment\n\t\nPlace the donor liver into the abdominal cavity. Shorten the donor and/or recipient suprahepatic vena cava inferior to an adequate length while avoiding kinking or too much tension on the anastomosis.\nPlace a single suture as a supporting thread (5-0 monofilament), adapting the right corner of the donor and recipient suprahepatic vena cavae inferior. Begin the dorsal side of the anastomosis from the left corner of the vessel(s) with a running suture (5-0 monofilament, double-armed).\nWhen reaching the right corner, remove the supporting thread, secure the running suture with a clamp, and continue with the ventral side of the anastomosis, again beginning from the left corner of the vessel(s). Tighten the suture with multiple knots without constricting the vessel diameter in order to avoid stenosis.\nShorten the donor and/or recipient portal vein to an adequate length while avoiding kinking or too much tension on the anastomosis.\nPerform a vascular anastomosis of the donor and recipient portal vein analogous to steps 3.3.2-3.3.3 using a 6-0 monofilament, double-armed suture.\nPerform the porto-venous reperfusion by removing the vascular clamp, occluding the recipient portal vein, and occlude the donor infrahepatic vena cava inferior with a vascular clamp after draining approximately 200-400 mL of blood. Slowly remove the vascular clamp occluding the recipient suprahepatic vena cava inferior and search for active bleeding.\n\t\t​NOTE: The removal of both clamps marks the end of the anhepatic phase. The amount of catecholamines required should significantly decrease shortly thereafter.",
    "Shorten the donor and/or recipient infrahepatic vena cava inferior. Perform a vascular anastomosis of the donor and recipient infrahepatic vena cavae inferior analogous to steps 3.3.2-3.3.3 using a 5-0 monofilament, double-armed suture. Remove the clamps occluding the donor and recipient infrahepatic vena cavae inferior.\nPrepare an elliptic aortal patch (Carrel patch) with a diameter of approximately 1-1.5, cm depending on anatomical circumstances, using scissors. Clamp the abdominal aorta with an atraumatic Cooley vascular clamp and make an incision by using a scalpel. Enlarge the incision using scissors to fit the patch.\nBegin the aortic anastomosis with a running suture (6-0 monofilament, double-armed) at the cranial corner of the incision/patch. When reaching the caudal corner, secure the running suture with a clamp and complete the anastomosis again beginning at the cranial corner. Tighten the suture with multiple knots and slowly remove the vascular clamp.\n\t\tNOTE: Clamping of the abdominal aorta will significantly affect the blood pressure of the pig. Communicate well with the anesthesiologist.\nPlace a hemostatic gauze around the arterial anastomosis. Place a catheter in the common bile duct and secure it with a single ligature. Make sure not to occlude the diameter of the catheter.\nClose the abdomen temporarily by adapting the muscular fascia and the skin with a running suture and cover the abdomen with cling film and/or drapes to avoid thermal loss.\n\t\tNOTE: If the scientific objectives require a chronic model, perform an end-to-end anastomosis between the donor and recipient bile duct, close the abdomen with separate running sutures for the peritoneum and the muscular fascia, and close the skin with single sutures.\nAt the end of follow-up, inject a lethal dose of 5,000 mg of pentobarbital sodium for intraoperative euthanasia.\nSubscription Required.
