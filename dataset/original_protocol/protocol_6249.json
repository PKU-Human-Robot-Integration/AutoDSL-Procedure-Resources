    "Any of the commercially available cultureware listed in Table 1 can be used in this cell culture system (thinner membranes will provide more rapid exchange with the ambient air). This procedure uses a 2-well slide plate (Coy Lab Products). This procedure can also be conducted using any adherent cell line. We have used this model system on HCT116 colorectal cancer cells (Martinez et al., 2019), U251 glioblastoma cells, PC3 prostate cancer cells, and MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 breast cancer cells. Others have used a related system on endothelial cells, astrocytes and breast cancer cells (Minoves et al., 2017). In our experience, all cell lines successfully attached onto oxygen-permeable membrane without need for an extracellular matrix protein coating. Some cell lines may require extracellular matrix coating of the membrane to facilitate attachment. Note: Ensure all cell culture handling is conducted using sterile technique in a laminar flow hood. Prepare cell cultureDepending on the cell line, prepare the appropriate media supplemented with 1x GlutaMAX and 10% FBS, as listed in Table 2. (Optional: add 50 IU/ml penicillin and 50 µg/ml streptomycin to the media).Pre-warm the media to 37 °C in a water bath.Seed cells onto a T75 flask in ~15 ml pre-warmed media.Culture cells in a standard humidified incubator maintained at 5% CO2 at 37 °C.Table 2. List of cell lines which have been tested in this model, the corresponding media, and the optimal seeding densities for a 6 h experimentimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190917/20190917200624_8714.jpgSeed cells onto oxygen-permeable membranesAspirate the media from the T75 flask, wash cells with sterile PBS and dissociate with 2.5 ml TrypLE dissociation reagent in the 37 °C incubator for approximately 2 min (until cells detach from the flask).Add 2.5 ml pre-warmed media to the flask and gently pipet cells to ensure even suspension before counting.",
    "Transfer cells to a 15 ml sterile tube and count cells using a hemocytometer.Centrifuge cells (using the Eppendorf 5810R) at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature.Aspirate and discard the supernatant.Add fresh, pre-warmed media to the pellet and resuspend cells, gently pipetting to ensure even suspension.Prepare a 2-well oxygen-permeable slide plate and seed cells in 1.5 ml media (see Figure 2A) at a density that enables cells to reach close to 100% confluency after 24 h incubation + the total duration in the treatment conditions (Optimal seeding densities for an 18 h experiment are shown in Table 2). For an 18 h experiment, the cells should be approximately 70-80% confluent before the dish is placed in the hypoxic chamber to be exposed to the treatment conditions (see Figure 2B).Culture cells in a standard humidified incubator maintained at 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 24 himgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190917/20190917200801_2579.jpgFigure 2.

Microscope image of HCT116 cells attached to the oxygen-permeable membrane 24 h after seeding.Set up hypoxic chamberThis procedure uses a custom-made, cylindrical acrylic hypoxic chamber. To construct a simple customized hypoxic chamber, we purchased various sizes of preassembled Clear Acrylic Round Cylinder Display Risers (Plymor, available through Amazon, USA). The dimensions of this cylinder-shaped hypoxic chamber are: 7 cm in diameter (internal) and 3.5 cm in height, with a total volume of 140 cm3 (Figure 3B). Flat pieces of acrylic (1 cm thick) can also be purchased from Plymor for use as the lid. The acrylic can be cut to a diameter slightly bigger than the diameter of the chamber. The lid of the chamber used in this protocol has a diameter of 8 cm (Figure 3A).",
    "To ensure a tight seal, a groove can be sculpted into the underside of the lid so that it fits snugly onto the cylinder (see Figure 3C). Alternatively, the addition of ~200 µl-500 µl of silicone grease on the rim of the hypoxic chamber at the start of the experiment should be enough to hold the lid in place to ensure an airtight fit. A weight can be added on top of the lid to ensure the lid stays in place (Figure 4D).  The hypoxic chamber should have inlet and outlet holes for flowing gases (Figure 3 and 4), which can be drilled in the lid. Tubing adaptors (see Figures 4A and 4B) can be purchased from the local hardware store and placed in the holes drilled in the lid (~1 cm in diameter). The adaptors can be secured in place using epoxy or silicone glue.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190917/20190917200840_2134.jpgFigure 3. Construction of a hypoxic chamber. A. The lid of the chamber is a flat piece of acrylic (purchased from Plymor, 1 cm thick) with a groove sculpted about 1 mm into the underside of the lid. The lid also contains two holes (1 cm in diameter) as an inlet and an outlet for flowing gases. Tubing adapters can be secured into these holes using epoxy or silicone glue. B. The hypoxic chamber is an acrylic cylinder with a flat bottom (purchased from Plymor). The cylinder is 7 cm in diameter, 3.5 cm in height and has a total volume of 140 cm3. C. The groove in the lid of the chamber nicely slots into the rim of the cylindrical hypoxic chamber to ensure an airtight fit.After 24 h incubation in the incubator, discard the media and replace with 1.5 ml pre-warmed media supplemented with 0.5% FBS.",
    "Seal the wells with sterile AeraSealTM film (see Figure 2A).Place the slide plate within a hypoxic chamber, ensuring that the underside of the oxygen-permeable membrane is elevated off the floor of the chamber. Note: Use pipette tips and BlutackTM to prop the plate up and use a spirit level to ensure the plate is level with the floor–see Figures 4A-4C. Place the lid on top of the chamber, ensuring that the inlet is positioned away from the culture plate to prevent gas from flowing directly onto cells (Figure 4A).Immerse the chambers in a 37 °C water bath within the CO2 incubator. The warm water bath assists in maintaining the chamber walls and internal gases at 37 °C.Note: If the chamber is prone to floating, use a weight to hold down the chamber in the water bath–see Figure 4D. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190917/20190917200913_0220.jpgFigure 4. Hypoxic chamber setup. A. Top view of the hypoxic chamber containing the 2-well slide plate. The 2-well plate is elevated by BlutackTM to the inner walls of the chamber.

For input tubing, use the tubing provided by MCQ for the gas mixer. Saint-Gobain T3 tubing is also acceptable. The chamber is held down by a weight.",
    "Define gas compositions to mimic tissue oxygenation (Examples/suggestions)Defining normoxiaOxygen concentrations to represent physiological normoxia may vary depending on the tissue of interest. There have been studies that have measured oxygenation in various tissues in vivo using an oxygen sensor (see Table 1 in [Hunyor and Cook, 2018]). Estimations can therefore be made based on these measurements. Alternatively, a good starting point is to use an oxygen concentration that represents oxygenation of cells located close to major blood vessels (~90 mmHg or 12% v/v).Defining hypoxiaHypoxic concentrations should be set according to the type of disease being modeled. In tumors, oxygen values can range from 2 to 15 mmHg, depending on the size, location and tissue type. 4 mmHg is a good starting point to reflect severe hypoxia in tumors.Defining intermittent hypoxiaProtocols of intermittent hypoxia will also depend on the type of disease being modeled. This procedure has been used in a previous study that modeled obstructive sleep apnea in tumors (Martinez et al., 2019). Oxygen concentrations for intermittent hypoxia were based on measurements taken in a mouse tumor (subcutaneous melanoma) model of obstructive sleep apnea. Oxygen fluctuations in the tumor alternated between ~5 mmHg (0.6% v/v) to ~50 mmHg (7% v/v) (Almendros et al., 2013), so protocols of oxygen cycling were modified to produce fluctuations between 5 and 50 mmHg in the pericellular media (Martinez et al., 2019) (see Figure 6G).Expose cells to the desired mixed gasesFor exposures to one oxygen condition (i.e., continuous normoxia or continuous hypoxia), the inlet of the chamber can be connected to a gas canister pre-mixed to the desired gas composition (If this step was used, skip to Procedure G).Alternatively, the inlet of the chamber can be connected to a gas blender connected to N2, O2 and CO2 gas sources.",
    "This step is particularly useful for changing oxygen conditions over time (i.e., for modeling intermittent hypoxia). See Procedure F for instructions on how to program the gas blender.Program the gas blender to the desired gas compositionTurn on the MCQ Gas Blender box.Open the MCQ Gas Mixture Creator PRO software (Figure 5).Select ‘Edit Program’.Enter the desired percentage (%) fractions of each gas component on the corresponding channel (CH) (See Figure 5B). For example:To program for physiological normoxia at 12% O2 (v/v) to mimic well-oxygenated cells near major blood vessels, set values for each channel to: N2 (CH1) = 83%, O2 (CH2) = 12%, CO2 (CH3) = 5% (buffer).To program for hypoxia at 0.5% O2 (v/v) to mimic severe tumor hypoxia, set values for each channel to: N2 (CH1) = 94.5%, O2 (CH2) = 0.5%, CO2 (CH3) = 5% (buffer).To program for intermittent hypoxia, set values in one line to: N2 (CH1) = 87%, O2 (CH2) = 8%, CO2 (CH3) = 5%. Select add line and set values of the second line to: N2 (CH1) = 95%, O2 (CH2) = 0%, CO2 (CH3) = 5% (buffer), etc.Set ‘FLOW’ (SCCM; equivalent to ml/min) to the desired flow rate.Set ‘TIME WORK’ to the desired duration of exposure in each condition.Save the protocol.Select ‘OK’.Select ‘Run program’ to begin exposure to the programmed oxygen conditions.Note: When modeling intermittent hypoxia, ‘TIME WORK’ duration may need to be extended to allow for oxygen concentrations in the pericellular media to reach the desired level. Oxygen concentrations in the pericellular media can be measured using an oxygen electrode (see Procedure G).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190917/20190917200941_4827.jpgFigure 5.

The job program editing page (after selecting ‘Edit Program’).",
    "To model intermittent hypoxia, N2 (CH1) was set to 87% or 95% per line, O2 (CH2) was set to 8% or 0% per line, and CO2 (CH3) was set to 5%. Flow rate was set to 500 SCCM (equivalent to ml/min). Time work was set to 5 min per line. C. The running program after selecting ‘Run Program’, starting with 87% N2, 8% O2, and 5% CO2. D. The running program when oxygen conditions alternate to 95% N2, 0% O2, and 5% CO2.Measure oxygen concentrations (to verify oxygen levels in the pericellular media)Preparation: drill an extra hole in the lid of the chamber to enable insertion of an oxygen or temperature probe. When not in use, seal the hole with foil adhesive. The size of the hole drilled should be appropriate for the size of the oxygen probe being used, which is brand and model dependent (typically 5 mm-1 cm in diameter).Insert the needle of the oxygen sensor through the hole in the lid of the chamber, through the AeraSeal film and twist the top of the sensor to extract the oxygen-sensing tip (see Figure 6A).Use a clamp stand to hold the electrode in place.Open the PreSens Measurement Studio 2 software.Select the OXY-1 channel.Select the ‘Measurements’ tab.Select ‘New’. Name the new measurement file.Click on the measurement file and select ‘Assign to’.Select the ‘Live View’ tab and click ‘Start’ to begin taking measurements.Export data Excel or GraphPad Prism and graph measurements (see Figures 6B-6G for examples).Note: Oxygen equilibration in the air is much faster than through media, so it is also useful to take initial measurements in the air within the chamber to ensure the oxygen probe is working correctly.",
    "Oxygen concentrations will also vary depending on the placement of the oxygen probe (oxygen concentrations at the pericellular level will not be accurate if the probe is not placed directly on the membrane (cell side)). The volume of the culture media added to the well will also affect oxygen concentrations (Minoves et al., 2017). Take care when handling the oxygen probe to prevent damage of the sensor and piercing of the membrane of the culture dish.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190917/20190917201028_7487.jpgFigure 6.

Time in each condition needed to be extended to 5 min in order for pericellular levels to reach the desired oxygen tension of 50 mmHg at the peak of cycles and 5 mmHg at the nadir or trough of cycles. Different oxygen concentrations can be modeled (see [Minoves et al., 2017]) depending on oxygen requirements for the tissue of interest.Harvest cells and analyze expressionCells can be analyzed by microscopy (1), by protein expression (2) or by mRNA expression (3).MicroscopyCommercially available oxygen-permeable dishes were originally developed for imaging purposes. Cells can be probed with fluorescent dyes or transfected with protein-specific green fluorescent proteins (GFPs) and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy.",
    "Protein expressionCells can be harvested to extract total protein by scraping cells in RIPA lysis buffer or harvested to separate nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins in the following procedure:Add 300 µl ice-cold cytoplasmic extraction buffer to each well of the culture plate.Scrape cells well and transfer the lysate to a pre-chilled 1.5 ml microtube.Vortex the microtube for 15 s and incubate on ice for 5 min.Centrifuge for 5 min at 4 °C (using the Fresco 21 at 21,100 x g).Aspirate the supernatant (cytoplasmic protein extract) and transfer to a pre-chilled 1.5 ml microtube. Place the microtube on ice or store at -30 °C until use.Resuspend the pellet in 100 µl ice-cold nuclear extraction buffer.Vortex the microtube for 15 s and incubate on ice for 10 min. Repeat Step H2c more times for a total duration of 40 min.Centrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C (using the Fresco 21 at 21,100 x g).Aspirate the supernatant (nuclear protein extract) and transfer to a pre-chilled 1.5 ml microtube. Place the microtube on ice or store at -30 °C until use. Discard the pellet.Protein expression can then be analyzed by western blotting.mRNA expressionCells can be harvested by scraping to extract total RNA. Use the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and follow procedure according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Convert purified mRNA to cDNA by reverse transcription. Quantify expression by qPCR."
