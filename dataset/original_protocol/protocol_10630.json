    "Animal housing and euthanasia: All animals used in this demonstration were housed under pathogen-free conditions in accordance to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and the National Institute of Health (NIH).\nProvide animals with standard hard-pellet rat chow and water ad lib. Euthanize animals via a two-step method of carbon dioxide asphyxiation, bilateral thoracotomy in accordance with the standard protocol of UCSF as approved by IACUC. Perform biomechanical testing within 24 hours of animal sacrifice to avoid tissue degradation.\n1. Preparation and Dissection of a Rat Mandible or Maxilla\nRemove rat mandibles by gently severing membranous tissue and muscle tissue attachments while preserving the entire mandible, including the coronoid process and the condylar process (Figure 1)15.\nSeparate hemimandibles by carefully cutting the fibrous tissue of mandibular symphysis with a scalpel blade.\n\tNote: The coronary and condylar processes, and ramus of the mandible (Figure 1) should be removed if they physically obstruct biomechanical testing of the 2nd molar.\nCut the incisors without exposing the pulp chamber as not to hinder loading of the molar.\n2. Specimen Preparation for in situ Compressive Loading (Figure 2)\nImmobilize the specimen on a steel stub by using a material that is significantly stiffer than the experimental specimen prior to loading it in an in situ loading device (Figure 2A).\n\tNote: Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) was used to immobilize the specimen in this study and excess, if any, was removed using a dental explorer.\nAlign the occlusal surface of the molar(s) of interest parallel with the AFM metal specimen disc using a straight edge in both planes (i.e. mesial-distal and buccal-lingual).\nCreate a trough with a blunt instrument surrounding the molars.\n\tNote: This space should serve as a “moat” to contain excess liquid and maintain tissue hydration during in situ loading.",
    "Prepare the tooth surface to build up for concentric (Figure 2B) or eccentric (Figure 2C) loading using a dental composite. Etch the surface of the tooth of interest with 35% phosphoric acid gel on occlusal surface for 15 sec.\nRinse the etchant thoroughly with deionized water and dry the surface using an air/water syringe or a compressed-air canister. With an explorer, spread a drop of the bonding agent into open cusps in a thin layer. Cure the composite with a dental curing light.\n\tNote: All steps involving composites should be performed without direct light from a lamp. Such conditions would undesirably accelerate the polymerization process, and could prevent proper placement of the composite. Room lighting is acceptable.\nRemove excess bonding agent from adjacent teeth with a fine scalpel or razor blade.\nPlace flowable dental composite on the surface following the preparation of the surface and spread it into grooves of the molar(s) of interest using a dental explorer.\nExpose the composite to dental curing light for 30 sec.\nMold an occlusal buildup of about 3-4 mm using a dental resin composite, from the occlusal plane of the molar(s) of interest and light cure for 30 sec.\nReduce the top of the composite buildup to a flat surface parallel to enable a consistent loading scheme across all specimens by using a straight edge and a high speed hand piece.\n\tNote: During biomechanical testing, other specimens should be stored in tris-phosphate buffered solution (TBS) with 50 mg/ml penicillin, and streptomycin15.\n3. Loading Device Drift and Stiffness, Material Property Differentiating Capability, in situ Loading of the Fibrous Joint\nSecure the specimen with the composite buildup on the anvil of the loading stage, and test for uniform loading as shown in Figure 2B.",
    "Place an articulating paper on the surface of the composite followed by loading the specimen to a finite load to check for concentric or eccentric loading (Figures 2B and 2C).\nPlace TBS-soaked Kimwipe around the specimen to ensure specimen hydration. Make a trough around the specimen and fill it with TBS to keep the organ hydrated during imaging.\nInput peak load and displacement rate into the Deben software to compress the molar to a desired peak load at a displacement rate following immobilization of the hemimandible.\n\tNote: Typical readouts should include a reactionary load as the material is compressed over time (load transducer sensitivity = 0.1 N). From load-time and displacement-time, a load-displacement curve for the compressed material should be obtained16-18. Using the data collected from the loading cycles, various properties of the joint can also be determined. The stiffness of the joint should be calculated by taking the slope of the linear portion (approximately the last 30% of the data) of the loading phase of the load vs. displacement curve19.\n4. Staining of Soft Tissue, the PDL, with Phosphotungstic Acid (PTA)\nNote: To enhance X-ray attenuation contrast, the PDL should be stained with 5% PTA solution20.\nBackfill PTA staining solution into a clean 1.8 ml glass carpule and place loaded carpule into syringe.\nInject solution slowly (5 min/carpule) into the PDL-space of adjacent teeth to prevent structural damage to periodontal tissues surrounding molar of interest.\n\tNote: The above steps should be repeated until about 5 full carpules (9 ml) of solution are injected and allowed to flow into the surrounding tissues. The prepped specimens can also be soaked overnight in the remaining PTA solution (8 hr).\n5. Recommended μ-XCT Scanning Settings\nPerform m-XCT with the following scanning settings:\ntable:\n﻿0,1\nObjective Magnification,\"4X, 10X\"\n,\"1,800 images\"",
    "X-ray tube voltage,75 kVp (50 kVp for PTA stained samples)\n,8 W\nExposure Time,~8-25 sec*\n,\"~4 μm (4X objective),~2 μm (10X objective) **\"\n* exposure time can vary based on the geometry and optical density of the specimen and X-ray tube voltage.\n** actual pixel resolution will slightly differ based on the configuration of the source, specimen, and detector.Subscription Required.
