    "All animal procedures were carried out according to the EU Directive (2010/63/EU) and were approved by the animal ethics committee of the Hungarian National Food Chain Safety Office (PEI/001/2894-11/2014). All applicable institutional and governmental regulations concerning the ethical use of animals were followed during this study.\n1. Preparation before surgery\nSterilize all instruments used during the procedure (see the Table of Materials) and disinfect the surfaces where the work is to be performed prior to the procedure.\nInject a single dose of subcutaneous antibiotics prophylactically.\n\tNOTE: See the Table of Materials for antibiotic dosage details.\nLeave the animals in the operating room for 1 h to acclimate them and decrease their stress prior to surgery.\nAnesthetize the rat via an intramuscular injection of a combination of ketamine and xylazine (ketamine 80 mg/kg body weight (bw) and xylazine 8 mg/kg bw).\n\tNOTE: In addition to anesthesia, the ketamine-xylazine combination provides sufficient analgesia for this procedure. The analgesia regimen can be modified per the institutional animal use guidelines.\nKeep the rat warm during the procedure using a heated table or infrared light and keep the eyes moist throughout the anesthesia using ophthalmic ointment (reapply as necessary).\nFixate the animal on the operating table using surgical tape on its front and back paws and tail, and depending on the site of injury, on the neck as well. If necessary, place the rat in a stereotaxic frame to stabilize it during surgery.\nUsing sterile surgical suture, place a loop around the upper front teeth of the rat and fixate this on the edge of the operating table.\nPull out the tongue sideways for airway management.\nShave the fur on the back, at least 2 cm in each direction of where the incision will be made.",
    "Disinfect the skin of the surgical area at least three times, using a povidone-iodine solution and sterile gauze. Take special care to soak the fur surrounding the area. Secure the surgical site with a sterile drape. \nAssess the adequacy of the anesthesia before placing the first incision by pinching the toes and the tail of the animal. Continue monitoring the adequacy of anesthesia during the entire procedure.\n2. Surgery\nPlace the skin incision using a scalpel blade 20. To open the surgical area, place a 2-2.5 cm long incision along the spine, cutting through all the layers of the skin. Position this incision parallel to the spinal column using the L1 vertebra as a midpoint, making it extend ~1 cm in both the cranial and caudal direction along the spinal column.\nMobilize the sides of the wound by cutting through the connective tissue surrounding the muscles.\nPlace two parallel incisions along the spine, penetrating the periosteum. Place the incisions right next to the spinal processes on both sides, spanning the distance between the Th13 and L1 vertebrae.\nDissect the muscles attached to the vertebrae with the aid of a raspatorium until all the spinal ligaments are visible. Put in place a retractor.\nRemove the spinal processes of the 13th thoracic vertebra and the 1st lumbar vertebra using dental bone forceps to visualize the entire surgical area. Hereon, control the procedure by viewing an enlarged (4x-16x magnification) microscopic image.\nUse sterile gauze to control bleeding throughout the procedure, when necessary.",
    "Carefully lift the remainder of the L1 spinal processes, elevating the L1 vertebral arch. Sever the ligamentum flavum to access the spinal cord. Raise the caudal spinal processes further, allowing access to the spinal dura mater, which is also severed. Tip the caudal spinal processes in the cranial direction to visualize the pia mater.\nLook through the pia mater for the posterior median vein, showcasing the midline of the spine.\nUsing the vein as a directional bisector, place an incision using a microsurgical scalpel while sparing the vein. Place the incision under the vein, in the transversal plane through the anteroposterior diameter of the spinal cord. Sever half of the spinal cord by moving the blade laterally away from the centerline.\n\tNOTE: The incision is unilateral, on the right side, at the 4th lumbar segment.\nTry to place the incision to avoid cutting the anterior spinal artery. Ensure excess pressure is not applied on the vertebral body when cutting the spinal cord to spare the anterior spinal artery on the ventral side of the spinal cord.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63534/63534fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Artwork showing the steps of the new open SCI technique in rats.

Tightly suture (suture size 4-0) the muscles along the spinal processes, indirectly closing the small wound on the dura mater.\nClose the dorsal connective tissue layer with sutures.\nFinally, suture the skin around the incision site.\n3. Postsurgical care and follow-up",
    "Allow the animals to awaken in their cages. Keep the animal(s) warm using a heat lamp in addition to the temperature-controlled room. Do not leave the rats alone after they awaken after surgery, and do not put them together with other rats in the same cage.\nMonitor their respiratory rate at least every 10 min until they are fully awake. If necessary, apply gentle stimulation (e.g., rub the head) to aid their awakening from anesthesia.\nWhen the animals are alert and appropriately active, transport them safely back to the animal house.\nKeep the rats under close surveillance for the first 24 h post surgery. Following the first 24 h post surgery, check the animals at least twice a day until the end of the experiment, monitoring for signs of distress.\nThoroughly assess them once a day for signs of distress using the relevant institutional animal welfare protocol and take special care to check their wounds for signs of infection and inflammation.\n\tNOTE: Stress and infection affect the welfare of the animals and the outcome of experiments.\nAdminister antibiotics subcutaneously every day until the end of the experiments. Keep the animals in sterile cages, one animal per cage, and give food and water ad libitum, same as before. At the end of the experiments (or if any serious adverse reaction is observed during the timeframe of the experiment), euthanize the animals humanely, in accordance with the relevant institutional animal welfare protocol.\n\tNOTE: Here, the animals were euthanized (in a deep sleep induced by the combination of ketamine-xylazine) by first administering a physiological saline perfusion (1/3 mL/g bw) followed by a 4% paraformaldehyde perfusion (1 mL/g bw).\nSubscription Required.
