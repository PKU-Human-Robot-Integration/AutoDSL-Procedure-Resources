    "NOTE: Ethics Statement: Procedures involving animal subjects were approved by the animal welfare committee of the University of Hamburg and the University of Saarland.\n1. Preparation and Fixation of Embryonic Tissue\nArrange all the equipment needed to dissect out the embryos and prepare solutions for subsequent fixation of the tissue before sacrificing the animals.\n\tNOTE: Always prepare a fresh 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution (4% PFA in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS), adjust pH to 7.4).\nEuthanize timed pregnant female mouse with an ethically approved procedure.\nTransfer the mouse onto a platform. Wet the ventral side of the abdomen with 70% ethanol and make a vertical incision using sharp scissors to expose the abdominal cavity.\nIdentify the embryonic chain and pull it out carefully using blunt forceps and place it into ice-cold PBS.\nRemove the individual embryos from the embryonic chain using fine scissors and forceps. Remove extra tissue around the embryos and wash them in ice-cold PBS.\nTake a small tail biopsy (before transferring the embryo into PFA) and incubate it in tail lysis buffer for the gender identification and tracer allele genotyping PCR.\nStart from the embryo at the most lateral side and transfer each embryo separately into a tube containing ice-cold 4% PFA on ice on a shaker.\nSoak the embryos at the age of E13.5 or younger for 1.5 hr on ice with constant shaking. Soak the embryos at age E14.5 and E15.5 for 2.5 hr on ice with constant shaking.\nFor embryos age E16.5 or older, decapitate and remove the outer skin before soaking the head in PFA solution. Heads of E16.5 embryos can be soaked for 4.5 hr on ice with constant shaking.",
    "After appropriate fixation, wash the embryos three times with ice-cold PBS. Transfer the embryos into 30% sucrose in PBS solution at 4 °C until they sink to the bottom.\n2. Freezing\nArrange all the materials required before starting the freezing process: cryo-mold, cryo-gloves, featherweight entomology forceps, marker pen and optimal cutting temperature compound (O.C.T.)\nLabel the cryo-mold with a permanent alcohol-resistant marker (mention the orientation of tissue, date and genotype). Prepare a slush of crushed dry ice and 100% ethanol in an ice bucket. Place a glass beaker inside containing isopentane. Wait for 10 min for the isopentane to cool down.\nMeanwhile remove the tissue from the sucrose solution, wipe off excess sucrose around the tissue using laboratory wipes. Transfer the tissue into a pre-labeled cryo-mold with sufficient O.C.T. to cover the tissue. Avoid any air bubbles in the O.C.T.; especially around the tissue.\nOrient the tissue in O.C.T. using featherweight entomology forceps to avoid tissue damage. Start freezing by transferring the cryo-mold into the pre-cooled isopentane bath. Do not splash isopentane into the O.C.T. as it will not freeze properly. Wrap the samples in aluminum foil and store at -80 °C.\n3. Cryosectioning\nCut 14 µm thin serial sections in series’ of five using a cryostat and collect on SuperFrost® Plus glass slides for immunofluorescence (IF) analysis. Store the slides at -80 °C until utilized.\n4. Tracer visualization Using the Tyramide Signal Amplification (TSA) Protocol\nPrepare the buffers and reagents required for staining. Always freshly prepare the Tris-NaCl-Tween (TNT) buffer on the day of use.",
    "Prepare TNT buffer using 100 ml of 1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 30 ml of 5 M NaCl and ddH2O up to a final volume of 1 L. Add 500 µl of Tween 20 using a 1 ml pipette. Add the Tween 20 slowly and flush the pipette up and down several times to ensure that all Tween 20 is in solution.\nPrepare Tris-NaCl-Blocking (TNB) buffer using 100 ml of 1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 30 ml of 5 M NaCl and ddH2O up to a final volume of 1 L. Add 5 g Blocking Reagent (provided with the kit) slowly in small increments to the buffer while stirring. Heat the solution gradually to 55 °C with continuous stirring to completely dissolve the Blocking Reagent (this should not take longer than 30-60 min). To achieve homogenous heating use a water bath at 55 °C. The solution will appear milky. Bring the solution to room temperature before using. Aliquot and store at -20 °C for long-term storage.\nReconstitute biotin tyramide reagent (provided with the kit) in Molecular Biology/HPLC-grade DMSO. Depending upon which kit is used the appropriate amount of DMSO may vary. Store the stock solution at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Sections from animals heterozygous for the respective Cre and R26 alleles can be used for circuit analysis. Use sections from littermates carrying one Cre or one R26 allele, respectively, as negative controls. Treat negative control slides exactly like slides from double heterozygous animals. In addition, include one control slide from a double heterozygous animal but leave out the TSA reagent (unamplified control).\nUsing a sharp fresh scalpel remove excess O.C.T. surrounding the tissue sections and mark the boundary around the sections with a PAP pen.",
    "Dry the slides for 2-3 min at room temperature (RT). Wash the slides at RT 3x with TNT for 5 min each. Incubate the slides at RT for 30 min in 0.3% H2O2 solution in ice-cold methanol to quench endogenous peroxidase activity.\nWash 3x with PBS for 5 min each at RT. Incubate for 10 min in 0.5% Triton-X 100 in PBS for tissue permeabilization. Wash the slides at RT 3x with TNT for 5 min each.\nBlock with TNB (blocking solution, 200-300 µl per slide) for 30 min at RT in a humidified chamber. Make sure all the sections are completely covered by TNB. Do not let the slides dry out in between the steps.\nDrain off excess blocking buffer and apply the primary antiserum recognizing the tracer (1:1,000 goat anti-WGA for BL, 1:15,000 rabbit anti-GFP for GTT) diluted in TNB for 2 hr at RT or overnight at 4 °C. Make sure to use enough volume to completely cover the tissue section (200-300 µl per slide).\n\tNOTE: The primary antisera dilutions recommended here may have to be adjusted.\nWash the slides at RT 3x with TNT for 5 min each with agitation.\nIncubate the sections with biotinylated secondary antiserum recognizing the host of the first antiserum (1:500 horse anti-goat IgG for anti-WGA, 1:5,000 goat anti-rabbit IgG for anti-GFP in TNB for 1 hr at RT).\nWash 3x with TNT at RT for 5 min each with agitation. Incubate in 1:100 streptavidin (SA)-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (SA-HRP, provided with the kit) in TNB for 30 min at RT in a humidified chamber. Wash the slides at RT 3x with TNT for 5 min each. Meanwhile thaw the TSA.",
    "Dilute TSA 1:50 in TSA amplification diluent (provided with the kit; use the TSA kit for the visualization of BL and the TSA+ kit for GTT). Incubate the tissue sections in diluted TSA for precisely 10 min at RT. Dilute TSA just before use, ideally during the previous washing step, do not use any remaining diluted TSA reagent for future experiments; always prepare fresh.\nWash the slides at RT 3x with TNT for 5 min each with agitation. Incubate with 1:500 Alexa Fluor® 546 streptavidin conjugate in TNB for 30 min at RT. Wash the slides at RT 3x with TNT for 5 min each with agitation.\nIncubate for 10 min in 5% bisbenzimide solution in PBS at RT for nuclear staining. Wash the slides at RT 3x with TNT for 5 min each with agitation. Mount with Fluromount G and perform epifluorescence or confocal microscopy.\nTroubleshooting: Efficacy of tracer transfer will depend on the expression level of the ROSA26 locus in the producing cells (determined by the Cre driver line used) and on the neural circuit analyzed (e.g. number of neurons producing the tracer, convergence etc.). Therefore the primary antisera dilutions recommended here may have to be adjusted to prevent low or excess signal. Background should always be analyzed using appropriate control slides (see above).\n5. τlacZ Staining for Embryonic Sections\nPrepare the buffers and reagents required for staining. Always freshly prepare the LacZ buffer C before use.\n\t\nPrepare 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal) stock solution (40 mg/ml) by adding 40 g of X-gal to 1 ml 70% dimethylformamide (DMF). Cover with aluminium foil and store at -20 °C for long-term storage.",

Make fresh just before use and cover with aluminium foil.\nDry the slides at RT at least for 10-15 min (meanwhile prepare the slides with a PAP pen).\nFix the section with LacZ fixative for 2 min at room temperature in a humidified chamber inside a chemical fume-hood. Wash 3 times with PBS supplemented with 2 mM MgCl2.\nRinse the slides with LacZ buffer A. Wash the slides with LacZ buffer A 3 times for 10 min each at RT. Wash 2 times with LacZ buffer B for 5 min each. Incubate the slides in LacZ buffer C at 30-37 °C for 6 hr or overnight in a humidified chamber.",
