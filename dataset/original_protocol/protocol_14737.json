    "All experiments were approved by the German Heart Center Munich and the Government of Bavaria, Germany (Gz. 55.2-1-54-2532.3-17-13). Animals were housed in a specific pathogen free facility and received human care in compliance with the ”Principles of Laboratory Animal Care” formulated by the National Society for Medical Research and the ”Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” provided by the National Academy of Sciences and published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication no. 86-23, revised 1985).\nNOTE: A complete set of sterile microsurgical instruments, including two curved forceps and vessel dilatators, is necessary for the procedure (Figure 2a). Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis is not routinely necessary but may be indicated in immunocompromised animals. Animals were sacrificed using terminal isoflurane inhalation.\nDonor Preparation and Graft Harvest\nAnesthetize the animal by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of midazolam (5.0 mg/kg), medetomidine (0.5 mg/kg) and fentanyl (0.05 mg/kg body weight). Place the mouse in a supine position on the operative field and confirm surgical tolerance by the pedal withdrawal reflex.\nDisinfect the skin three times with chlorhexidine and perform a midline abdominal incision. Retract the intestines with wet gauze to the left to expose the inferior vena cava.\nInject 50 IU of heparin diluted in 0.4 ml saline through the inferior vena cava for anticoagulation. Incise the vessel 1 min after heparinization.\nOpen the diaphragm and perform a bilateral thoracotomy to expose the heart. The anterior chest wall is reflected superiorly and held in place with a clamp.\nRemove the thymus and bluntly dissect the connective tissue between aorta and pulmonary trunk. Incise the right superior vena cava.",
    "Puncture the mobilized ascending aorta at the level of the brachiocephalic trunk with a 30 G needle mounted on a 5 ml syringe and slowly perfuse the heart retrogradually without excessive pressure with 3 ml of 4 °C cold cardioplegic solution. Avoid the entry of air into the coronary circulation. Drop ice-cold saline solution onto the graft to further enhance cardiac arrest.\nTransect the aorta proximally to the origin of the brachiocephalic trunk.\nLigate the inferior and both superior venae cavae close to the heart with 8-0 silk and transect them distally to the ligatures.\nDissect free the pulmonary trunk as distally as possible. Ligate the pulmonary arteries close to the bifurcation with 8-0 silk and transect them distally.\nLigate the pulmonary veins all together with a single 8-0 silk ligature and transect them.\nRemove the heart from the donor and store it in ice-cold cardioplegic solution until implantation.\n2. Recipient Preparation\nPrepare the cuffs for anastomoses by cutting the polyimide tubing with a No. 11 scalpel or a scissor under the microscope. The cuff consists of a cylindrical body and an extension (1/3 of the circumference) for the placement of the vascular clamp, each of a length of 1 mm (Figure 2b).\nAnesthetize the animal and confirm surgical tolerance as described above. Inject 0.25 ml warm saline solution subcutaneously (s.c.) for fluid replacement.\nRemove the hair of the right cervical region using an electric shaver and place the animal in a supine position on a warm pad. Secure the legs with strands of tape while avoiding overstretching the front limbs as this can compromise respiration. Cover the eyes using ophthalmic ointment to prevent dryness. Disinfect the surgical site three times with chlorhexidine.\nMake a transverse skin incision from the right mandibular angle to the jugular notch.",
    "Bluntly mobilize the external jugular vein. Cauterize side branches with a bipolar forceps and transect them.\nDivide the external jugular vein between ligatures at the level of the confluence with the vein from the submandibular gland.\nPull the external jugular vein through the cuff and occlude the vessel proximally by placing a vascular clamp on the extension of the cuff. Remove the ligature and irrigate the vessel lumen with 1:10 heparinized saline.\nEvert the vessel wall over the cuff and fix it with a preset circumferential 8-0 silk ligature.\nRemove the superficial part of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.\nMobilize the right common carotid artery and transect the vessel between ligatures below the carotid bifurcation.\nPull the carotid artery through the cuff and occlude the vessel proximally by placing a Yasargil clamp on the extension of the cuff. Remove the ligature and irrigate the vessel lumen with 1:10 heparinized saline.\nGently dilate the arterial lumen with a vessel dilatator, evert the vessel wall over the cuff and fix it with a preset circumferential 8-0 silk ligature.\nTo gain enough space for graft implantation, remove the right lobe of the submandibular gland.\nKeep the operative field moist until implantation.\n3. Graft Implantation\nPlace the graft in the recipient cervical region upside down with the aorta orientated medially and the pulmonary artery laterally.\nPull the aorta of the graft over the cuff with the carotid artery and secure the anastomosis with a circumferential 8-0 silk ligature.\nIncise the pulmonary trunk on its anterior aspect and pull it over the cuff with the external jugular vein. Again secure the anastomosis with a circumferential 8-0 silk ligature.",
    "Remove the clamp on the external jugular vein, following by unclamping of the carotid artery. The hearts fills immediately with blood. To enhance reperfusion drop 37 °C warm saline solution onto the graft. Normally the heart develops sinus rhythm within one minute. Remove the cuff extension at the venous site.\nEnsure correct graft position, anastomoses must be tension-free and vessels without torsion. Do not cauterized vessels of the skin since this may impair wound healing. Bleeding usually stops spontaneously. Close the skin with a single 8-0 continuous suture.\n4. Postoperative Care\nInject 0.25 ml warm saline solution s.c. for fluid replacement.\nTo antagonize narcotics inject naloxone (1.2 mg/kg), flumazenil (0.5 mg/kg) and atipamezol (2.5 mg/kg body weight) s.c. Left the animal on the warm pad until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Observe the animal for at least one additional hour to register any abnormal behavior. Do not return an animal that has undergone surgery to the company of other animals until fully recovered.\nProvide preemptive analgesia with buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg s.c. three times per day) or an alternative analgesia according to a local institutional protocol for a minimum duration of 72 hr after the procedure.\nThe surgeon and a veterinarian should see animals regularly. In case of weight loss >15%, apathy, swelling or surgical side infection animals are euthanized using terminal isoflurane inhalation.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
