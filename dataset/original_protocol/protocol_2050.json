    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nGeneration of CN and CN/AML iPSC-derived CD34+CD45+ cells (HPCs) using embryoid body (EB)-based serum-free iPSC differentiation protocol with subsequent analysis of HPCs.\nNote: Our differentiation protocol is mainly designed for iPSCs maintained under feeder-free conditions on Geltrex or Matrigel using StemFlex or mTESR medium. Before EB formation, iPSCs are transferred for only one day to SNL feeder cells to synchronize cell cycle and facilitate induction of differentiation. However, it also works for iPSCs maintained on feeder cells. In this case, the transfer to feeder cells before EB formation should be skipped.\nEB-based iPSC differentiation\nTiming: 16 days\nTwo days before EB formation, seed 4 × 105 mitotically inactivated MMC-treated SNL feeder cells on a 3.5 cm2 cell culture dish. SNL is a ready-made immortal mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) cell line.\nCritical: SNL feeder cells are helpful for efficient differentiation of many iPSC lines. However, it can be tried out to differentiate any iPSC clone first without the use of SNL feeder cells.\nNote: Mitotically inactivated SNL feeder cells should be prepared before starting iPSC differentiation experiment as described for Sl/Sl feeder cells in the ‘before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]’ section. Procedure is the same for SNL feeder cells.\nOne day before EB formation, seed 7 × 105 feeder-free iPSCs dissociated into single cell suspension from one well of a 6-well plate to a 3.5 cm2 dish with SNL feeder cells in iPSC maintenance medium supplemented freshly with bFGF (30 ng/mL) and ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632 dihydrochloride) (10 nM).\nNote: iPSC maintenance medium without bFGF or ROCK inhibitor can be stored up to 4 months at 4°C.",
    "Critical: Seeding density of iPSCs on SNL feeder cells is critical. iPSC cannot be counted again at the day of EB formation since PBS/EDTA solution for detachment of cells results in cell clumps instead of single cells. For some iPSC lines, iPSCs show no efficient attachment to feeder cells. In this case, seeding density should be increased. If seeding density varies too much, EB size will be incorrect, which results in inefficient iPSC differentiation.\nOn the day of EB formation (day 1), pre-cool centrifuge to 4°C.\nPrepare APEL medium for EB formation. From one 3.5 cm2 dish, you can produce up to 30 EBs. Prepare 3 mL of APEL medium supplemented with ROCK inhibitor (10 nM), bFGF (10 ng/mL) and BMP4 (40 ng/mL) for 30 EBs.\nRemove iPSC maintenance medium from iPSCs and wash once with 1 mL warm PBS. Detach SNL feeder cells by pipetting gently up and down several times during washing step. SNL feeder will detach quite easily, while iPSCs stay attached. An example of iPSCs pre and post SNL feeder removal is shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1642-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Morphological examination of iPSC maintenance on- and without feeder cells\n(A and B) iPSCs pre (A) and post (B) SNL-feeder removal.\nCritical: It is important to get rid of the majority of SNL feeder cells to obtain compact EBs. If too many feeder cells remain, EBs may be very fragile. The presence of feeder cells may also prevent proper outgrowth of endothelial cells after plating of EBs to Geltrex coated plates on day four.\nAdd 1 mL PBS/0.02% EDTA for 7 min, remove PBS/EDTA solution and detach all iPSCs in prepared APEL medium.",
    "Critical: Do not use Accutase or any other cell detachment solution in this step since it will prevent proper formation of compact EBs. Further, do not incubate cells longer than maximum 7 min in PBS/0.02% EDTA. This would also lead to fragile EBs.\nCollect iPSCs in a Fgealcon tube and distribute 100 μL per well of iPSC suspension to a 96-well plate with conical bottom. One EB consists of approximately 20,000 cells.\nCentrifuge plate for 5 min at 435 g and 4°C.\nCritical: It is necessary to centrifuge iPSCs for EBs at 4°C since it will increase efficiency of compact EB formation.\nIncubate plate at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nOn day three, prepare Geltrex coated 6 well plates (see described above).\nOn day four, plate EBs on Geltrex coated wells (10 EBs/well) in 2 mL per well of APEL medium supplemented with VEGF (40 ng/mL), SCF (100 ng/mL) and IL-3 (50 ng/mL).\nCritical: Do not touch EBs for at least 24 h, since it might interrupt EB attachment and outgrowth.\nOn day eight, change medium to 2 mL APEL medium supplemented with SCF (100 ng/mL), TPO (50 ng/mL), FLT3L (50 ng/mL), IL-3 (50 ng/mL) and IL-6 (20 ng/mL). Hematopoietic cells start to appear from day 8.\nOn day eleven, add 2 mL of APEL with SCF (100 ng/mL), TPO (50 ng/mL), FLT3L (50 ng/mL), IL-3 (50 ng/mL) and IL-6 (20 ng/mL).\nOn day 14, harvest floating hematopoietic cells which are mainly CD34+CD45+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). This should be confirmed by the flow cytometry analysis panel of HPCs and morphological evaluation of cytospin preparations (see below).\nNote: HPC numbers can be highly variable between various iPSC clones.",
    "These HPCs can be used for various analyses like colony-forming unit (CFU) assay. Further, they can be expanded for at least 14 days on feeder cells or used for drug treatment studies on feeder cells or under feeder free conditions.\nThe scheme of EB-based iPSC to HPC differentiation protocol is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1642-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Scheme of EB-based iPSC to HPC differentiation protocol\nAnalysis of iPSC-derived CD34+CD45+ cells (HPCs) by flow cytometry\nTiming: 4 h\nHarvest 6 × 104 floating cells from EB-differentiation system at day 14 and centrifuge for 5 min at 300 g. 3 × 104 cells are usually used for staining with specific antibody and 3 × 104 cells for unstained control.\nResuspend cells in 180 μL ice-cold FACS Buffer.\nAdd 90 μL of cell suspension into each FACS tube on ice.\nAdd antibodies as described in the ‘List of antibodies for flow cytometry analysis of iPSC-derived HPCs’.\nIncubate for 20 min on ice and protected from light.\nCritical: It is important to keep antibodies protected from light. Especially tandem dyes like PE-Cy7 are extremely sensitive and degrade easily.\nAdd 1 mL ice-cold FACS Buffer to wash stained cells.\nCentrifuge 5 min at 300 g, 4°C and discard supernatant.\nResuspend cell pellet in 150 μL ice-cold FACS Buffer.\nEvaluate stained cells on BD FACS Canto II analyze data with FlowJo software (BD Biosciences). Representative images of flow cytometry are shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]. CD34+ expression should be > 80%.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1642-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Flow cytometry analysis of iPSC-derived HPCs\nNote: Comprehensive multicolor flow cytometry analysis of iPSC-derived cells at early stages of hematopoietic differentiation was already described by us in Methods of Molecular Biology (Dannenmann et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nCytospin preparations and Pappenheim Staining (May-Grünwald & Giemsa staining) of iPSC-derived HPCs\nTiming: 2 h",
    "Harvest and spin down 20,000 cells/cytospin slide from EB-differentiation system at day 14 at 300g for 5 min.\nPrepare cytospin slides either by centrifugation using Thermo Scientific Cytospin 4 Centrifuge (4 min at 250 rpm/10 g) or add a drop of your cell suspension and let it dry, if your cells may be damaged by centrifugation.\nStain your cells for 5 min in May-Grünwald-Solution.\nRinse slides with dH20.\nStain your cells for 20 min in 1:20 diluted Giemsa-Solution.\nRinse slides with dH20.\nLet slides dry for at least 1 h.\nTake pictures of slides with any bright-field microscope using 100× objective with oil. Examples are shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1642-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Pappenheim staining of iPSC-derived HPCs\nNote: If you plan to expand iPSC-derived HPCs after analysis, CFU-Assay could be skipped (33–39). Freezing of iPSC-derived HPCs is not recommend, since survival rate after defreezing is only approximately 50%. It is recommended to perform the complete protocol without pause points.\nAnalysis of HPC differentiation potential: Colony forming unit assay (CFU-Assay) of iPSC-derived HPCs\nTiming: 14 days\nNote: CFU-Assay (steps 33–39) can be performed in parallel with expansion of iPSC-derived HPCs (steps 40–53).\nCFU-Assay is used for measurement of proliferation and differentiation ability of individual cells within a sample, in this case mainly CD34+CD45+ cells (HPCs). The potential of these cells is measured by the observation of the colonies (consisting of more differentiated cells) produced by each input progenitor cell. 14 days of culture is sufficient to allow colonies to grow to a size which allows accurate counting and identification, though shorter periods may be used in certain situations.\nColony assay protocol\nAdd cells in IMDM and Anti-Anti to the MethoCult H4435 tube as described in ‘Preparation of MethoCult H4435/cell mixture’.",
    "Alternatives: If MethoCult H4230 is used: Add cells in IMDM, cytokines in IMDM, and Anti-Anti to the MethoCult H4230 tube as described in ‘Preparation of MethoCult H4230/cell mixture’.\nVortex for 30s.\nWait for 10 min till bubbles go up.\nSeed 1.1 mL each into 3.5 cm dishes.\nPut two dishes with cells and one dish filled with PBS without lid (to prevent MethoCult medium and cells from drying) in 10 cm dish.\nIncubate at 37°C.\nCount colonies after 14 days. Counting criteria and examples for CFU colony types are described in the MethoCult Manual from STEMCELL Technologies (https://www.stemcell.com/methocult-h4435-enriched.html[href=https://www.stemcell.com/methocult-h4435-enriched.html]). iPSC-derived HPCs form primarily three CFU colony types: CFU-granulocyte (CFU-G), CFU-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) and CFU-macrophage (CFU-M) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1642-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Examples for CFU-G, CFU-GM, and CFU-M of iPSC-derived HPCs after 14 days\nExpansion of CN and CN/AML iPSC-derived HPCs (CD34+CD45+ cells) and primary AML or CN/AML blasts on Sl/Sl (FLT3L) feeder cells\nNote: Expansion of iPSC-derived HPCs can be performed in parallel with CFU-Assay.\nThawing MMC treated Sl/Sl cells\nTiming: 20 min (thawing) + 24–48 h (incubation)\nNote: MMC treated Sl/Sl cell should be thawed 1–2 days before adding iPSC-derived CD34+CD45+ cells for expansion.\nPrepare four 3.5cm dishes coated with collagen (as described above).\nThaw one vial 1.5 × 106 MMC treated cells in warm medium (DMEM + 15% FBS).\nCentrifuge 5 min at 300 g.\nResuspend in 4 × 2.5 mL HLTM (MyeloCult H5100) medium with 10−6 M Hydrocortisone and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin.\nPipet 2.5 mL cell suspension / dish.\nLeave for 24 h in the incubator before seeding cells for expansion.",
    "Note: Since iPSC-derived CD34+CD45+ cells proliferate more slowly than primary CD34+ cells, it is recommended to culture these cells on 24-well plates. For this purpose, thaw 1.5 × 106 Sl/Sl cells on the inner 8 wells of a 24-well plate and fill the outer wells with PBS.\nProtocol for expansion of iPSC-derived CD34+CD45+ cells on Sl/Sl (FLT3L) feeder cells\nTiming: 1 h (seeding, medium preparation) + up to 14 days for expansion\nPrepare HLTM medium supplemented with Hydrocortisone (10−6 M) and cytokines freshly before adding cells for expansion as described in ‘Overview of cytokines for iPSC-derived CD34+CD45+ cell expansion’.\nSeed 1–2 × 105 iPSC-derived CD34+CD45+ cells/well of a 24 well-plate with Sl/Sl (FLT3L) feeder cells in 0.5 mL HLTM medium supplemented with cytokines (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section). Depending on the cell number needed for later experiments, you can scale up well-size to 12 well or 6 well plate. Cells double in average every 2–3 days.\nAdd 500 μL HLTM supplemented with Hydrocortisone (10−6 M) and cytokines (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section) twice per week or change medium completely.\nExpand cells to a maximum density of 2 × 106 cells/mL. This density is typically reached after 10–14 days depending on starting cell number and iPSC-clone.\nNote: CN-iPSC derived CD34+CD45+ cells expand well for at least 2 weeks, CN/AML-iPSC derived CD34+ cells for more than 4 weeks.\nCD34+ cells on Sl/Sl feeder cells are partially attached at the bottom in a quite loose fashion or in suspension. CD34+ cells can be harvested by gently pipetting up and down several times without detaching Sl/Sl feeder cells.",
    "Harvested CD34+ cells can be directly used for further experiments (e.g., terminal differentiation to mature hematopoietic cells, RNA-seq, CFU-assay) when desired cell number is reached, or can be frozen using CTS PSC freezing medium, which is a single cell & stem cell freezing medium that ensures high cell survival rate after thawing. Depending on the desired downstream analysis and the percentage of CD34 expression after expansion, enrichment of CD34+ cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) could be performed.\nNote: The expansion protocol described above can be also applied for primary AML blasts or CN/AML blast. Whereas expansion of iPSC-derived HPCs is possible for most iPSC lines for only 14 days, primary AML or CN/AML blasts can be expanded with our Sl/Sl (FLT3L) feeder system for several months.\nQuality control of expanded CD34+CD45+ cells by flow cytometry analysis\nTiming: 4 h\nAnalyze your iPSC-derived CD34+CD45+ cells before expansion on Sl/Sl feeder when you harvest them from your iPSC differentiation system by flow cytometry.\nPerform flow cytometry analysis every 2–3 days to monitor your proliferation experiment and quality of HPCs.\nNote: If your cells in expansion still show a high proliferation rate, they should express CD34. If proliferation rate slows down, you will notice a decrease in CD34 expression. To monitor proliferation rate, count cell number every 3–4 days.\nDrug treatment of primary AML or CN/AML blasts and CN/AML iPSC-derived CD34+CD45+ cells on Sl/Sl (FLT3L) feeder cells\nTiming: up to 7 days\nTreatment of primary AML or CN/AML blasts and CN/AML iPSC-derived CD34+CD45+ HPCs on Sl/Sl feeder (FLT3L) cells with small molecules or other drugs is recommended if primary AML and CN/AML blasts do not expand under feeder-free conditions or if the treatment of blasts is planned as a long-term experiment (> 2 weeks).",
    "Before you start to apply any drug to your co-culture system, test its toxicity for Sl/Sl feeder (FLT3L) cells first. If feeder cells are undergoing apoptosis, try feeder free conditions.\nExpansion medium preparation and seeding of cells for expansion long-term culture. Add the drug you want to test to your expansion medium.\nSmall molecule/drug should be refreshed depending on its half-life. For most small molecules it is recommended to refresh half of the expansion medium with freshly added drugs every 3 days.\nIf your cells expand slowly, it is also sufficient to add fresh medium with your drug by changing a half of the medium once a week.\nCheck viability of your feeder cells regularly.\nFor counting of cell number, pipet gently up and down culture medium to mix cells evenly without detaching feeder cells. Use the cell counting device of your choice.\nDrug treatment of CN/AML iPSC-derived CD34+CD45+ cells under feeder-free conditions\nTiming: up to 7 days\nIf drug treatment of CN/AML iPSC-derived CD34+CD45+ cells on Sl/Sl (FLT3L) feeder cells is leading to apoptosis of feeder cells, it is recommended to perform drug treatment under feeder free conditions. However, not many samples of CD34+CD45+ cells may expand under feeder-free conditions.\nPrepare serum free CD34+ expansion medium (Stem Span SFEM II medium supplemented with cytokines, see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section) freshly before adding your cells for expansion.\nAdd your drug in the concentration needed.\nSeed 1–2 × 105 iPSC-derived CD34+CD45+ cells/well of a 24 well-plate in 1 mL CD34+ expansion medium.\nSmall molecule /drug should be refreshed depending on its half-life. For most small molecules it is recommended to refresh half of the expansion medium with freshly added drugs every 3 days.",
    "If your cells expand slowly it is also fine to add medium fresh medium with your drug and change half of the medium once per week.\nFor counting of cell number, pipet gently up and down cells suspension to mix cells evenly. Using the counting device of your choice.\nAlternatives: You can timely monitor your experiment using Live Cell Imaging System IncuCyte (Sartorius)."
