    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIn utero injection of virus\nTiming: 1–2 h\nOverall experimental workflow of in utero injection has been partially described (Herrlinger et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Walantus et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Yamada et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). In utero injection has been used to investigate ZIKV infection induced neurological deficits in fetus brain (Li et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Shao et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Yuan et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Zhu et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). E13.5 embryos are subject to in utero injection with ZIKV or AAV-GFP virus (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1315-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Schematic diagram of in utero injection\n(A) Schematic diagram of embryonic brain infection by ZIKV or AAV-GFP. Virus was micro-injected at lateral ventricle (LV) at E13.5, and experiments like body length were examined at E18.5. Sterile DMEM is used as sham injection control.\n(B) Shown is key steps for in utero injection.\nNote: AAV-GFP here is primarily used to trace whether and where the delivered gene is expressed. Using this protocol, other viruses or materials like siRNA are also applicable.\nDilute ZIKV stock to 5 × 105 PFU/mL or AAV-GFP stock to 5 × 1011 viral genomes per mL (vg/mL), aliquote the dilution as needed and keep the aliquot on ice.\nNote: Either DMEM or PBS is optional for dilution in the biological safety cabinet. The discarded solutions, tips, tubes, etc., should be soaked in 10% bleach.\nAssemble the grinded pipette onto a Hamilton syringe, saturate the syringe with tubing with mineral oil and absorb about 8 μL of virus aliquot into the pipette.\nNote: Adjust the volume of absorbed virus aliquot according to the actual requirement.\nCritical: Loading the virus into the injection system and subsequent in utero injection should be performed in BSL-2 hood.",
    "Anesthetize the dam with controllable isoflurane (Measured gas flow: 0.5 L/min; Anesthesia: 3% for induction and 2% for maintaining) by inhalation delivery while waste gas scavenging is present. Pinch and check the anesthetized mouse on the toe tip by forceps. Weigh the mouse and inject buprenorphine-SR (0.5–1.0 mg/kg) subcutaneously at the neck to induce analgesia.\nNote: It’s mandatory to document the usage history of buprenorphine-SR appropriately.\nCritical: The toe pinch forceps are no longer sterile and thus are not suitable for touching embryos later.\nLay the anesthetized mouse supine on an animal-friendly heating pad with appropriate size and add ophthalmic ointment to the eyes.\nNote: Do not forget to use the ointment in order to protect the eyes from drying.\nTrim the fur on the abdomen via veterinary hair clipper and disinfect with iodine and 70% alcohol at least three times. Drape the skin surrounding the surgical site with clean cloth to prevent contamination of the incision and the tools.\nNote: Alternate the iodine and alcohol wipes and wipe in a circular motion away from the surgical site.\nCritical: The drape opening (1.5–2 cm width rhombus) must be larger than the surgical site than you plan. Carefully check and avoid any pollutant like hair or string in the drape opening.\nPinch the mother’s skin a little away from her abdomen with sterile forceps and use sterilized scissors to cut the abdomen at the place of 1 cm away from vaginal opening and towards the head continue to cut into the skin and abdominal cavity for 1–1.5 cm along the medial sagittal line until the embryos are exposed (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1315-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Creating abdominal opening",
    "Trim the abdominal hair and sterilize the abdomen with Iodophor and subsequently 70% alcohol. Create a 1–1.5 cm length opening via scissor to make the embryos exposed. Cover the mouse with both sterilized drape and gauze while the opening is exposed for injection.\nCut a slit in the middle of a sterile gauze with appropriate size and put on top of the surgical opening. Hydrate the surgical opening with sterile and warm PBS. Pull the embryos out through the slit on the gauze.\nNote: There are often 4–5 embryos in one uterine horn and thus only no more than 5 embryos can be pulled out at one time.\nGently place a spatula under the head of the embryo. Lighten the embryos with a lamp to visualize the skull sutures, which help navigate the inject site later.\nCritical: Hydrate the surgical opening with sterile and warm PBS (37°C maintained in a heating block) during the surgery to prevent them from drying out.\nLocate the head by handling the embryo with both the lamp and your fingers until the head of the embryo is pushed up against the uterine wall and held in place with the non-dominant hand. If unideal injection position causes final low virus load. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]\nNote: Record the relative position of the embryos injected by different viruses, if possible, because embryos usually do not change their relative location during developing in utero. It is often suggested that the embryos at one uterine horn (usually 4–5 ones) as one group are injected with one virus.",
    "Critical: The embryo positioning should be practiced well because it is very important for successful surgery. Excessive finger pressure is likely to impair delicate embryonic membrane eventually causing embryo death later, while inadequate pressure could delay the injection process to make the embryo in danger.\nEmploy the blood vessel running along the skull suture as a navigation. Inject ZIKV (1 μL, equivalent to 500 PFU virus) or AAV-GFP (1 μL, equivalent to 5 × 108 vg) into the lateral ventricles of E13.5 embryo brains (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). Either sterile DMEM or PBS is used as a sham injection control accordingly.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1315-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Virus microinjection\n(A) Take 3–4 embryos out from the abdomen one time and hydrate the embryos with sterile and warm PBS to avoid drying out.\n(B) Left hand is used to stabilize the embryo and make an injection with right hand while the injection site must bypass blood vessel.\n(C) Schematic diagram of 1 uL volume of liquid injection by marked pipette, which helps judge whether the product has been really injected. Red arrow indicates movement direction of liquid in the pipette during injection.\nNote: Marking each 1 μL increment on the pipette outer surface using a marker pen is an option to help judge successful injection.\nCritical: Carefully avoid blood vessels when choosing the injection site on embryonic brain to prevent hemorrhage and consequently embryo lethality.\nCritical: Operate the injection as fast as possible at no cost of successful rate to decrease the time of the whole surgery and thereby increase survival rate of both mother and embryo.\nPut the injected embryos back into the pregnant dams. Hydrate the abdominal cavity with sterile PBS at last time. In a two-round interrupted suture, first suture the abdominal peritoneal muscle and then suture the external skin layer.",
    "Critical: Suturing is very critical for improving maintenance of the pregnancy because it is likely to happen that, due to skin inflammation, the mouse tends to scratch and chew the suture to cause wound rupture. In some serious cases, embryos are even exposed outside. Thus, the suture should be performed very carefully.\nPlace the mouse in a cage partially heated by a heating pad or light to avoid body temperature reduction during anesthesia. Check frequently mothers in the cage until they recover from anesthesia.\nPut the cage back to the mouse room and develop the embryos after surgery for varied time according to the experimental plan. If Low survival rate of the pregnancy subjected to in utero injection happened at the endpoints. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]\nNote: Considering the mother after the surgery at the abdomen, it is difficult to move to drink water or stand to eat food, animal food and additional not-wetting water gel are better to be placed on cage ground.\nCollecting embryonic heads\nTiming: 30 min\nThis major step accomplishes embryonic head collection at experimental endpoint.\nEuthanize the mother with E16.5 or E18.5 embryos by CO2. Place the euthanized mother on the pad. Using forceps and scissors take the embryo out from the uterine horn. Put the embryos on another clean pad and take a picture of the whole embryo body with an appropriate scale to determine body length.\nCollect embryonic heads by carefully cutting at the neck and fix the heads in 4% PFA at 4°C for 24 h.\nCritical: It is recommended to perform the procedure in step 15 on a platform on top of ice.\nExamine embryonic brain width\nTiming: 1–2 days\nThis major step accomplishes to examine microcephaly related phenotypes.",
    "Wash the fixed heads with clean PBS for 5 min each time (at least 5 times). Dissect the embryonic brains from the heads (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]) and take images of the brains using a Stereo Microscope (Leica, M165FC) or another available microscope to examine brain width.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1315-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Collect embryonic brains\n(A) After 4% PFA fixation, remove soft skin and skull via sharp forceps while carefully avoiding to damage brain.\n(B) Take the brain out carefully via a flat spoon to ensure no damage of brain surface.\nNote: Washing the heads with PBS as complete as possible because potential evaporated PFA is harmful.\nCritical: When dissecting the embryonic brains, the skin and skull should be gently removed to avoid damaging soft brain tissue and keep its completeness as much as possible. For this, dissection should be done under an appropriate stereoscope.\nFor cryo-sectioning, fixed brain tissues are cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS for 16 h at 4°C and embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound. Cryostat sections are cut at 20 μm thickness. For vibratome sectioning, fixed brains are embedded in 5% low melt agarose and cut at 30 μm thickness.\nBrain sections are permeabilized in PBS-T (PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100) for 10 min, blocked with 5% normal donkey serum for 60 min, followed by observation with fluorescent microscope for GFP signal or incubation of scheduled primary antibodies.\nNote: Coronal or sagittal sectioning is determined based on the histological perimeters.\nCritical: It’s important that three comparable cryosections from each brain at 100 μm intervals should be immune-stained, from which appropriate quantification is performed."
