    "All experiments and animal care were conducted in accordance with protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at Wayne State University (protocol no. 17-11-0399).\n1. Preparation for the experiment\nBuild a rectangular open-lid enclosure to house the mouse during looming visual stimuli presentation. We constructed a 40 cm x 50 cm x 33 cm enclosure using aluminum framing and PVC panels (Figure 1A,B). Lay a sheet of paper to cover the entire floor of the enclosure to ensure easy cleanup between trials. Add an opaque shelter in a corner of the enclosure with an entrance facing the center of the arena for easy entrance and exit.\nSet up a camera with a wide-angle lens for capturing the mouse’s behavior. Secure the camera to a table-mounted stand adjacent to the enclosure. For best quality video capturing, use a camera frame rate of 60 FPS or higher.\nSet up a computer monitor on top of the enclosure. Because the monitor could not be seen from the outside, a second monitor was prepared, which duplicated the images shown on the primary monitor.\nPrepare a looming pattern for projection. One way to do this is to use the PsychToolbox3 within MatLab software to code for an expanding black circle (Figure 1C). Set the stimulus to begin at a visual angle of 2° and expand to 50° over 250 ms; these parameters determine stimulus speed (see Figure 1D for visual angle calculation). Set the code to repeat the stimulus 10 times with an interval of 1 s.\n\tNOTE: The stimulus began each repetition immediately upon termination of the previous presentation. For further information on stimulus presentation, please refer to section 3.",
    "Select mice of interest for the looming stimuli. Here, use 32 healthy-eyed mice of a C57 background, male and female, 4 to 14 weeks old. Also, use 3 blind mice (severe cataracts in both eyes) to assess whether the response to looming stimulus was truly a visually guided behavior. These blind mice had no pupillary light reflex and no optomotor response.\n2. Mouse acclimation\nPlace a mouse in the enclosure and let it freely explore its surroundings. If possible, try to minimize stress during animal transfer by using the back of your free hand as a resting place for the mouse instead of letting it hang without support. The mouse should find the entire enclosure to be safe and should discover the hiding place. Drop a few food pellets in the corner opposite the refuge to encourage the mouse to remain outside the refuge.\nAllow the mouse to acclimate anywhere from 7 to 15 min29,39. We allowed 10 min of acclimation prior to stimulus onset. Furthermore, 10 min acclimation one day prior to the experiment may ease the mice.\n3. Looming visual stimuli projection\nPrior to inserting the mouse into the arena, make sure the stimulus code is ready to run to facilitate as few lighting changes as possible while the mouse is in the enclosure. Once the software is ready to run, gently place the mouse in the enclosure.\n10 seconds prior to the stimulation, start the video capturing.\nStart the looming visual stimuli when the mouse is away from the shelter and moving freely in the open arena. Wait 10 seconds after the last stimulus presentation to terminate the recording.",
    "Begin the stimulus presentation when the mouse is in the corner farthest from the refuge. However, when mice seem unwilling to explore the far corner, present the stimulus when the mouse is in a different corner of the arena. This does not appear to make a difference in animal behavioral response.\nTransfer the mouse back to its original cage. Clean the enclosure for the next mouse by spraying the walls and refuge with 70% ethanol and wiping it down. Replace the paper floor liner if soiled and reposition the refuge to the same initial location if moved during animal transfer and enclosure cleaning.\n4. Video analysis\nSave the video clip for each mouse in .avi format without file compression in order to ensure no data loss during transfer to the analysis software.\n\tNOTE: Lack of compression will lead to larger file size; therefore, use external hard drive for storage.\nUse analysis software to track the animal’s motion around the arena prior to, during, and after stimulus presentation. Use commercially available software (see Table of Materials) with a manual tracking ability to track the position of the mouse head in every video frame, which generated X and Y coordination every 1/60 ms. Other motion-tracking software includes FIJI (NIH)40 and EthoVision (Noldus).\nCalculate the velocity and the distance of the mouse from the refuge. If the image of the arena is distorted due to the video angle, correct the X and Y coordination prior to the calculation (Figure 2).",
    "Compare the parameters before and after looming stimulus onset to determine how the mouse responded to the stimuli, whether by freezing, fleeing, or demonstrating no change in behavior29. Define freezing as episodes where speed was less than 20 mm/s for 0.5 s or longer. Define flight as episodes where speed increased to 400 mm/s or greater and ended with the mouse in the refuge. Definitions for freezing and flight were based on those set by Franceschi et al.29\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
