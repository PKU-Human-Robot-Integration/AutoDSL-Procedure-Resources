    "The Day before T cell IsolationPrepare antibody-coated 6-well platesCoat 6-well plate with antibodies against mouse CD3 (anti-CD3) and CD28 (anti-CD28). Dissolve the antibodies in PBS at final concentration of 2.5 µg/ml in a 15 ml Falcon tube. Use 2 ml of PBS/well (12 ml for all 6 wells). Mix the antibody solution by inverting the tube several times and let stand for a few minutes to ensure homogenous distribution before plating 2 ml/well. Seal the 6-well plate using parafilm to prevent evaporation of the antibody solution and incubate the 6-well plate at 4°C overnight. This substrate will be used to activate CD4+ T cells isolated from mouse lymph nodes (LN) and spleen.Note: As a general rule, plating antibodies at 4°C overnight leads to better coating. If imaging chambers need to be prepared in a hurry on the same day as imaging, 2-3 h plating at 37°C can also lead to acceptable antibody coating. Prepare antibody-coated imaging chambersIf planning to image TCR-activated Ca2+ signals in freshly isolated T cells on plate-bound anti-CD3/anti-CD28 the next day, prepare imaging chambers by coating 35 mm MatTek glass-bottom dishes with anti-CD3/anti-CD28. Use 2.5 µg/ml of each antibody in PBS and add 250 µl to the center of the 35 mm dish. Incubate at 4°C overnight. Seal the chamber with parafilm to prevent evaporation of liquid. Confirm that the chamber is on a flat surface to ensure uniform concentration of the coated antibody throughout. Note: The concentration of coating antibodies can be varied depending on the research question being asked. Lower concentrations of antibodies may be used to study Ca2+ signals in response to a smaller TCR activation stimulus. Cross-linking of CD3 is the primary stimulus for TCR induced Ca2+ signaling.",
    "Cross-linking of CD28 provides a co-stimulatory signal, which may not be critical for short-term Ca2+ signaling but helps the T cells to attach to the substrate better and may be important to sustain Ca2+ signaling after several hours of plating.  Prepare Poly-L-Lysine (PLL) coated chambersAdd 250 µl of 100% PLL (1 mg/ml in molecular grade water) to the center of 35 mm dishes at room temperature (RT). Let it sit for 1 hour. Wash off the PLL 2-3 times with PBS and let the chambers dry. They are now ready to be used anytime within 2-3 weeks. Store at room temperature (RT) away from light. Note: PLL-coated chambers provide positively charged but non-activating substrates to attach T cells and are useful to study changes in cytosolic Ca2+ in response to receptor activators and inhibitors, Ca2+ channel agonists and antagonists, etc. These are usually added by perfusion/solution exchange to the 35 mm dishes containing the cells.  Prepare mouse T cell media containing RPMI with 10% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1× non-essential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 55 µM β-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 µg/ml of streptomycin, and 0.25 µg/ml of Amphotericin B.On the Day of T cell IsolationDissect LN and spleen from mouse. Place in 3 ml of RPMI complete or T cell media. Use the bottom of a 3 ml syringe to mash and pass cells through a 70 µm filter into a 50 ml Falcon tube. Use the EasySepTM mouse CD4+ T cell isolation kit to isolate CD4+ T cells following kit instructions.After isolation is complete, wash cells with excess media to remove all traces of EDTA. Resuspend cells in 4-5 ml of fresh warmed T cell media and count the cells. Each mouse yields approximately 10 million CD4+ T cells.",
    "Meanwhile, bring the 6-well plate to RT in the tissue culture (TC) hood and wash the antibody-coated wells 2-3 times with PBS to remove the uncoated antibody. Add approximately 2 million cells into each 6 well to activate T cells. Cells should be suspended in T cell media + 30 U/ml of recombinant mouse IL-2. Add 4 ml of media per well.Note: Cells activated for 2 days are ideal for imaging, although cells can be used freshly after isolation (resting T cells) or after 1, 2, or 3 days of activation. Note that some cells may start losing their viability after 48 h due to excessive activation. Spinning the cells at a low speed may help to get rid of some dead cells, but not all. Prepare Cells for Imaging Note: The plating protocol under this section applies to T cells that express genetically encoded Ca2+ probes and that do not require loading with chemical Ca2+ dyes. When using dyes, additional loading steps need to be followed (see Section D on Dye loading).  Re-suspend cells in media at an optimal concentration just before they are plated on the imaging dishes. When working with freshly isolated T cells (which are small), re-suspend at 4-5 million/ml. This gives a 60-70% confluency when plated on anti-CD3/anti-CD28 coated or PLL coated 35 mm dishes. When working with 2-day activated T cells, which are larger in size, re-suspend at 1 million/ml. The cell suspension should be kept at 37°C (either in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube or 15 ml Falcon tube, depending on the volume, with the caps loose to ensure CO2 exchange) in the TC incubator on the day of imaging.",
    "For imaging, plate approximately 50-100 µl of cell suspension into the center of the 35 mm dish and place the dish (and remaining cells) back in the incubator. Incubation time for T cells plated on imaging dish: 15 min for PLL and approximately 1 h for anti-CD3/anti-CD28.Notes:  Ensure sufficient CO2 exchange by keeping the cap loose or open in the incubator. Gently mix cells in the Falcon or Eppendorf tubes every 30 min to prevent formation of cell pellets. Cells will be fine at RT for short periods of time, but it is important to have them at 37°C for imaging, especially with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 coated dishes. It is highly recommended to plate and incubate cells for imaging in a TC Hood close to the microscope. Move cells very gently to the microscope. Moving imaging chambers that contain T cells plated on anti-CD3/anti-CD28 over longer distances can easily cause detachment of the cells. Cells plated on PLL tend to attach better.  In our experience, having a low volume of cell suspension (50-100 µl) in the imaging dish for up to an hour does not adversely affect cell viability. Volume can be increased up to 250 µl if cell viability is a concern. Additional media (2 ml) should be gently added to the sides of the chamber if cells are to be kept in the incubator for a longer time. Plating times for cells on PLL: Do not exceed 15 min. Cell viability will be adversely affected after 30 min on PLL. This gives ~15-20 min of imaging time. Less than 10 min of plating may not lead to good cell attachment.",
    "Plating times for cells on anti-CD3/anti-CD28: While 1 h plating is more than sufficient to ensure proper cell attachment and TCR signaling activation, shorter and longer plating times are also possible. Cells can potentially attach within 5-10 min, which might be useful to study the early Ca2+ events of TCR signaling. One may also consider adding the cells to the imaging chamber when on the microscope to get the very early events of T cell signaling. For this, cells would need to be added close to the imaging field right where the objective is, at a very high density and low volume (say 500,000 cells in 10 µl or so). Cells can be imaged up to 24-48 h after plating if the cells are healthy and bathed in sufficient fresh media. This applies more to freshly isolated cells as 2 day-activated cells are more likely to start dying due to the additional period of TCR stimuli.  At the end of the plating time, wash attached cells very gently with 2 ml of the final imaging solution (1 mM Ca2+ Ringer’s solution) twice to remove unattached cells. Gently add fresh imaging buffer to attached cells and mount on the microscope for imaging.Synchronize the timing for plating and imaging multiple samples: When imaging multiple dishes in a single session, ensure the same plating times between different samples for reproducibility. Figure 1 shows an example protocol for imaging four imaging dishes (T cells plated on PLL) in a single session. The protocol may be modified depending on the imaging time for each sample.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4170/bioprotoc-11-19-4170-g001.jpgFigure 1. Sequential preparation and imaging of T cell samples expressing Salsa6f GECI. Each box represents a 15 min time interval. Blue box: Plate T cells onto imaging chamber and incubate at 37°C for 15 min.",
    "Green box: Wash attached cells, mount on microscope, and image. The numbers on the left refer to sample or chamber. The protocol can be modified to accommodate longer or shorter imaging times.Working with chemical Calcium indicator dyes (Fluo-4 AM and Fura-Red AM, or Fura-2 AM for Ratiometric Imaging)Prepare stocks of the Ca2+ dyes at 2 mM in DMSO. Stocks are stored at -20°C. Bring stock to RT before imaging. All dyes are used at 3 µM final concentration. Dye is mixed with an equal volume of pluronic acid to facilitate loading into cells. Pluronic acid is stored at RT and needs to be warmed up to 40°C for 20-30 min before use (it is a gel at RT, which will make pipetting small volumes impossible).‘Intermediate working’ concentration of dye solution: Prepare dye solution in T cell media that is twice (6 µM) the final concentration (3 µM). Each imaging dish requires around 100 µl of cell suspension (50 µl of dye solution at 6 µM + 50 µl of cell suspension at 2× concentration). In a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, add the required volume of the dye from the 2 mM stock, then add an equal volume of pre-warmed pluronic acid and mix vigorously by vortexing several times. Finally, add the required volume of T cell media and vortex again. This is the ‘intermediate’ 2× working solution of the dye.For experiments on PLL: For each imaging chamber, take 50 µl of 2× dye solution and mix with 50 µl of 2× cell suspension in a 1.5 ml tube. Incubate for 15 min at 37°C in the TC incubator, then add to the center of a PLL coated dish. Plate for 15 min at 37°C in the TC incubator. Wash 2-3 times with imaging buffer and image on the scope.",
    "Figure 2 depicts an example protocol for performing multiple experiments in a single imaging session using Ca2+ dyes.Note: Cell suspension also needs to be at 2× concentration (10 million/ml for resting or freshly isolated T cells and 2 million/ml for activated T cells). Mixing with the 2× dye solution at a 1:1 ratio will result in the optimal concentration of dye and cells. The 2× dye solution and 2×  cell suspension need to be stored in the TC incubator for further experiments. Ensure sufficient CO2 exchange.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4170/bioprotoc-11-19-4170-g002.jpgFigure 2. Sequential preparation and imaging of T cells using chemical Ca2+ indicators.  Each box represents a 15 min time interval. Blue box: Mix 2× dye solution (50 µl) with 2× cell suspension (50 µl) in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and incubate for 15 min in TC Incubator. Red box: Plate 100 µl of dye-loaded T cell suspension onto the imaging chamber and further incubate for 15 min in TC Incubator. Green box: Wash unattached cells, mount imaging chamber on microscope and image. The numbers on the left refer to the samples. The protocol can be modified to accommodate longer or shorter imaging times.For experiments on anti-CD3/anti-CD28: For each imaging chamber, take 50 µl of 2× dye solution and mix with 50 µl of 2× cell suspension in a 1.5 ml tube. Plate immediately to the center of an anti-CD3/28 coated dish. Plate for 30-60 min at 37°C in the TC incubator. Wash 2-3 times with imaging buffer and image on the microscope.Notes: Note that on both PLL and anti-CD3/28, the total dye incubation time with cells is 30 min. For anti-CD3/28 coated chamber, longer dye incubation times may be used if cells do not attach to the substrate in 30 min. Consider reducing dye concentration in that case.",
    "Ensure the loading conditions are consistent between all samples. This is critical for proper comparison, especially for Fluo-4 and Fura-Red imaging. For cells with genetically encoded Calcium indicators from transgenic mice, steps in section D do not apply. Data acquisition Images were acquired at 37°C on the Olympus FV3000 confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with high-speed Resonant Scanner, IX3- ZDC2 Z-drift compensator, 40× Silicone Oil Objective, high sensitivity GaAsP detectors, and Tokai Hit Stage Top Incubation System (Figure 3). Exposure time using the resonant scanner is 0.034 msec/ single line scan, which was averaged six times for each frame. Images are acquired on a single plane (no Z stack). For Salsa6f imaging, GCaMP6f (green channel) and tdTomato (red Channel) are excited sequentially using 488 nm (0.3% laser power, 450V PMT) and 561 nm (0.05% laser power, 450V PMT) Diode lasers respectively. The detectors are set at 494-544nm and 580-680nm for the green and red channels, respectively. For ratiometric imaging using Fluo-4 and Fura-Red, both dyes are excited at 488 nm at 0.07% laser power and detection settings are similar to Salsa6f. Time-lapse images are recorded at 2.5 s/ frame on the Olympus fluoview software and saved as .OIR files.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4170/bioprotoc-11-19-4170-g003.jpgFigure 3.
