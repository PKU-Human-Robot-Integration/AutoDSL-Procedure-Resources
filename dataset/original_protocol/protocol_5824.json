  "procedures": [
    "We found that decrotonylation by HDACs did not occur on synthetic, modified histone tail peptides, necessitating the use of the full-length recombinant histone. In our assay, we first crotonylate histones in vitro using recombinant histone H3.1 and the catalytic domain of p300 (‘p300’). We then follow decrotonylation by class I HDACs using specific antibodies, here against histone H3 crotonylated at lysine 18 (H3K18cr). H3K18cr is the dominant histone crotonylation mediated by p300 (Sabari et al., 2015) and appears to be the most abundant histone crotonylation in histones isolated from intestinal cells (Fellows et al., 2018). Importantly, highly specific antibodies have been generated that recognize H3K18cr (Sabari et al., 2015). We describe an assay for decrotonylation to address three questions: can HDAC1 remove the crotonyl group and how much of it is required, how effective is the HDAC inhibitor butyrate at preventing decrotonylation by HDAC1 and what are the kinetic parameters of HDAC1 regarding the decrotonylation of histone H3? The same steps can be performed for other acylations, such as acetylation, butyrylation or propionylation using the relevant acyl-CoA and antibody. This protocol can also be used to test other HDAC enzymes, using the relevant recombinant protein, and other HDAC inhibitors such as Trichostatin A (TSA) and Vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, SAHA).Part I: In vitro decrotonylation assay In vitro crotonylation of recombinant histone H3.1 using the catalytic domain of p300Defrost all reagents on ice.Dilute the 5 mM crotonyl-CoA stock solution 1:50 in histone acylation buffer.Prepare the reaction mix in a 0.2 ml PCR tube as described in Table 1.Table 1. Histone H3 crotonylation reaction set-upimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180713/20180713022155_2341.jpgMix well by pipetting or brief vortexing.Incubate for 2 h at 30 °C in a thermocycler.Transfer to a thermocycler at 65 °C and incubate for 5 min to stop the reaction.Note: Histone tails are unstructured.",
    "Therefore heat inactivation is unlikely to affect the modification. Place the tube on ice.HDAC1 mediated histone decrotonylation assayDecrotonylation assay with different concentrations of HDAC1We verify the activity of the HDAC1 enzyme towards the substrate and demonstrate the minimum amount required to observe the decrotonylation reaction.Dilute the reaction from Part I Procedure A 1:3 in HDAC assay buffer, i.e., 46 μl of reaction mix and 92 μl of HDAC assay buffer.Cut 3 tubes away from an 8-tube strip leaving a 5-tube strip.Label these PCR tubes as 1-5.On ice, add diluted reaction mix, HDAC assay buffer and HDAC1 as described below and shown in Table 2.Note: This sets up a two-fold serial dilution of HDAC1 in tubes 1-4 whilst keeping the other reagents constant. Tube 5 is the negative control without any HDAC1. As soon as HDAC1 has been added to tube 1, perform all steps as quickly as possible as the reaction will start from this point. Whilst it is impossible to capture the first few seconds of the reaction, as it takes a few seconds to set it up, it is important to be quick so that the initial phase of the reaction is recorded. To tube 1, add 28 μl of diluted reaction mix.To tubes 2-5, add 14 μl of diluted reaction mix.Add 1 μl HDAC assay buffer to tubes 2-5 to allow for the HDAC1 volume.Add 2 μl of HDAC1 to tube 1 and mix well (0.1 mg/ml, 1.78 µM stock. 0.12 µM final concentration).Remove 15 μl from tube 1, add to tube 2 and mix well.Remove 15 μl from tube 2, add to tube 3 and mix well.Repeat with tubes 3 and 4 but not tube 5.Table 2. Reaction set-up with a serial dilution of HDAC1imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180713/20180713023323_8021.jpgVortex all tubes briefly by holding both sides of the strip.",
    "Spin tubes briefly to bring all of the liquid to the bottom of the tube.Incubate in a thermocycler at 30 °C for 2 h.As soon as the time is up, remove from the thermocycler.If the sample is to be run on a gel, add 15 μl (an equal volume) of 2x Laemmli with 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol and incubate at 95 °C for 1 min to stop the reaction.If the sample is to be dot-blotted, just incubate at 95 °C for 1 min to stop the reaction.At this point the tubes can be frozen at -20 °C for at least a few days or continued with further analysis as explained in Part II.Exploring the effect of an HDAC inhibitor on histone decrotonylationHere, butyrate is introduced in serial dilution which allows testing of the ability of the compound to inhibit the decrotonylation. This can be used to estimate the concentration of inhibitor required to halve the amount of created product (IC50).Dilute the reaction mix from Part I A 1:3 in HDAC assay buffer i.e., 46 μl of reaction mix and 92 μl of HDAC assay buffer.Label an 8-strip of PCR tubes as 1-8.On ice, add diluted reaction mix, HDAC assay buffer, butyrate and HDAC1 as described below and shown in Table 3.Note: A double reaction is prepared in tube 1 and single reactions in tubes 2-6, allowing a two-fold serial dilution of butyrate to be performed in tubes 1-6 whilst keeping the other reagents constant. Tube 7 and 8 are negative controls, tube 7 is without butyrate and tube 8 is without butyrate and HDAC1. As soon as HDAC1 has been added to tube 1, perform all steps as quickly as possible as the reaction will start from this point. To tube 1, add 28 μl of diluted reaction mix.",
    "To tubes 2-8, add 14 μl of diluted reaction mix.Add 1 μl HDAC assay buffer to tubes 2-7 to allow for the volume of butyrate added to tube 1.Add 2 μl HDAC assay buffer to tube 8 to allow for the volume of butyrate and HDAC1.Add 2 μl of 160 mM butyrate to tube 1 to give a final concentration of 10 mM once all reagents have been added.Add 2 μl of HDAC1 to tube 1 and mix well (0.1 mg/ml, 1.78 µM stock. 0.11 µM final concentration).Add 1 μl of HDAC1 to tubes 2-7.Remove 16 μl from tube 1, add to tube 2 and mix well.Remove 16 μl from tube 2, add to tube 3 and mix well.Repeat with tubes 3, 4, 5 and 6 but not tubes 7 or 8.Table 3. Reaction set-up with a serial dilution of butyrate and constant HDAC1imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180713/20180713024651_3266.jpgVortex all tubes by holding both sides of the strip.Incubate at 30 °C for 2 h.As soon as the time is up, remove from the thermocycler.If the sample is to be run on a gel, add 16 μl (an equal volume) of 2x Laemmli with 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol and incubate at 95 °C for 1 min.If the sample is to be dot-blotted, just incubate at 95 °C for 1 min.At this point the tubes can be frozen at -20 °C for at least a few days or continued with further analysis as explained in Part II.Determination of kinetic parameters of histone decrotonylationDetermination of kinetic parameters such as the maximum initial rate allows assessment of whether the enzyme follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics and is a useful way to find out important kinetic parameters such as Kcat, Vmax and Km.",
    "It allows comparison of an enzyme’s activity with different substrates or comparison of the activity of different enzymes with the same substrate. This requires the change in substrate or product concentration to be plotted over time so that the initial rate can be determined (see Figure 1 for illustration). The concentration of the enzyme must be optimized so that the initial rate is within a measurable timeframe. Initial rates are then plotted against the substrate concentration at the start of the reaction, to determine the maximum rate (Vmax) and substrate concentration at half Vmax (Km) as shown in Figure 1. As the reactions performed here are analyzed by antibody-based approaches, they cannot be measured in real time. Therefore, it is necessary to set up a reaction for each time point. Here, six identical reactions are set up and stopped at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 10 min. The shortest time point that is practical with the method we present is 30 sec. To reliably determine kinetic parameters, it is also necessary to perform the reaction three times for each substrate concentration, and five different substrate concentrations are recommended. This means that 90 reactions are required (5 substrate concentrations x 6 time points x 3 replicates). These have been grouped into three replicate sets named A, B, and C. In our hands, and as described below, the initial reaction occurs in the first minute. Reducing the amount of enzyme may allow longer reaction times and thus more time points during the initial phase. However, this must be balanced against keeping the change in substrate concentration for all reactions distinguishable from background noise.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180713/20180713025700_5198.jpgFigure 1. Enzyme kinetic graphs. The left graph shows the output of the assay, which gives the change in substrate concentration over time.",
    "The initial rate is determined from this by finding the gradient of the first part of the reaction which is linear. In the right graph, the initial rates of all the substrate concentrations tested are plotted to give the Michaelis-Menten curve which is hyperbolic. This allows determination of the kinetic parameters Vmax and Km.Crotonylate H3.1 as described in Part I Procedure A.To prepare enough crotonylated H3 for 90 assays, use more of each component to give a total volume of 230 µl as described in Table 4.Table 4. Histone H3 crotonylation reaction set-up with a larger volumeimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180713/20180713025903_3917.jpgIncubate in a thermocycler at 30 °C for 2 h.Transfer the tube to another thermocycler at 65 °C and incubate for 5 min to stop the reaction.Place tube on ice.On ice, dilute the reaction mix in HDAC assay buffer to give 1:4, 1:6, 1:8, 1:10 and 1:12 dilutions of the crotonylated histone H3.Note: Table 5 describes how to do this serially whilst using the minimal quantity of starting reaction mix. However, this can be done in a different way if required. At least 260 µl is needed for each dilution of the crotonylated histone H3 for the following steps.Table 5. Preparation of different dilutions of the crotonyl-H3 reaction miximgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180713/20180713030214_9291.jpgPrepare three 5-strip tubes numbered 0 min and labeled 1:4, 1:6, 1:8, 1:10 and 1:12 (first row of Figures 2A, 2B, or 2C in blue).Prepare 15 more 5-strip tubes numbered 0.5, 1, 2, 4 or 10 (minutes) and labeled 1:4, 1:6, 1:8, 1:10 and 1:12 (the following five rows in Figure 2 in red).On ice, add 14 μl of the 1:4, 1:6, 1:8, 1:10 or 1:12 diluted reaction mix to each one. The tubes are kept on ice until HDAC1 is added.",
    "To one strip of reactions labeled 0 min (in Figure 2 in blue), add 1 μl HDAC assay buffer.Vortex briefly by holding both sides of the strip.Note: The tubes may be spun down or liquid carefully tapped to the bottom if there are bubbles or liquid on the sides or lid of the tube.Incubate immediately in a thermocycler at 30 °C for 1 min.Note: If HDAC1 is added to a reaction it would not be zero time, but would run for a few seconds until the reaction could be stopped. However, a negative control is needed to provide a baseline level. To make sure that no change in substrate concentration is seen without enzyme, we incubated a reaction without HDAC1 for 2 h and saw no reduction in crotonylated H3. Therefore, 1 min was chosen as this is easy to perform. Transfer to a thermocycler at 95 °C for 1 min.Repeat Steps B3f to B3i with the two other strips of tubes labelled 0 min.Dilute the HDAC1 stock solution 1:4 in HDAC assay buffer, i.e., 20 µl HDAC1 and 60 µl HDAC assay buffer.To each tube in one strip of reactions labeled 0.5 min (in Figure 2 in red), add 1 μl of diluted HDAC1 (for 0.03 µM final concentration).Vortex briefly by holding both sides of the strip and briefly spin or tap liquid down if required.Incubate immediately in a thermocycler set to 30 °C for 30 sec.Note: It will take about 20-30 sec to add the HDAC and vortex. If time points shorter than 30 sec are needed, reduce the amount of enzyme rather than doing shorter reaction times as these will be inaccurate. Transfer the strip to a thermocycler at 95 °C for 1 min to stop the reaction.Repeat Steps B3l-B3o with the other 0.",
    "5 min strips and then with the 1, 2, 4 and 10 min strips in stages, varying the incubation at 30 °C accordingly.Note: It is necessary to start the reactions in stages so that the time points can be exact.Organize the tubes so that you have replicate sets of reactions labeled A, B and C. The tubes can be frozen at this point or the experiment continued as described in Part II Procedure B.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180713/20180713030433_3154.jpgFigure 2. Setup of reactions. The setup of all 90 reactions is shown, organized into replicate number, time and dilution of reaction mix.Part II: Revealing the decrotonylation result using antibody-based approaches Western blotWestern blot is suited to assays with a low number of individual reactions and provides clear bands of defined molecular weight, showing how the reaction progressed.Open a pre-cast SDS-PAGE gel and rinse the wells with Milli-Q water to rinse away the preserving solutions and bubbles in the wells.Assemble the gel in the electrophoresis tank with 200 ml of 1x MES buffer in the inner chamber and fill the outer chamber half full with 1x MES buffer.Note: Make sure that the inner tank is not leaking. Use a buffer dam if there is only one gel in the tank. MES buffer should be fresh each time in the inner chamber but can be used up to three times in the outer chamber. Placing the tank on ice may improve the quality of the run.Load 5 µl of pre-stained protein marker in the first well of the pre-cast SDS-PAGE gel.Load 8 µl of each sample in the subsequent wells.Run at 100-150 V, 250 mA for 1-1.5 h until the blue dye front reaches the bottom of the gel and/or the different sized bands of the marker have separated.",
    "Rinse gel in 1x TGS buffer briefly and cut off the wells from the top of the gel.Soak blotting paper in transfer buffer and place onto the semi-dry transfer machine.Soak a piece of nitrocellulose membrane that is the same size as the blotting paper in transfer buffer and layer on top of the blotting paper taking care not to introduce bubbles in between the layers.Layer the gel on top of the stack, positioning the marker so that it is parallel to the vertical side of the membrane and so that the blue line, showing how far the samples have reached, is above the membrane.Note: Again take care not to introduce bubbles in between the layers.Trim the gel so that it is the same size as the membrane.Note: When many gels are run, it is useful to cut a corner or corners of the membrane to distinguish them. Pen is not advised as it will run.Place another piece of blotting paper soaked in transfer buffer on top.Roll a round tube, such as a 10 ml pipette, firmly from one side to the other on top of the stack to remove any remaining bubbles. Transfer proteins onto the membrane for 45 min at 15 V, 270 mA.Note: One hour is recommended when two or three stacks are in the transfer machine.Place the membrane in a 50 ml Falcon tube and rinse membrane in TBS-T for a few seconds.Block by adding 15 ml TBS-T BSA and incubate with gentle agitation at room temperature for 1 h.In a 5 ml Eppendorf tube, prepare a 5 ml solution of anti-H3K18 crotonyl antibody at 1:2,000 to 1:5,000 dilution (depending on lot number of antibody) in TBS-T BSA.",
    "Pour the used TBS-T BSA solution into another tube, which should be stored at 4 °C for later use and add the solution of primary antibody to the membrane containing tube.Incubate overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation (rocking or rolling).Wash three times briefly (5-10 sec) with 10 ml TBS-T.Wash twice for 15 min with 15 ml TBS-T and gentle agitation.Wash once for 15 min with 15 ml TBS-T BSA.Note: The TBS-T BSA from the previous day can be re-used.In a 5 ml Eppendorf tube, prepare a 5 ml solution of anti-rabbit antibody coupled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) at 1:10,000 dilution in TBS-T BSA.Discard the TBS-T BSA and incubate in anti-rabbit antibody for 1 h at room temperature.Wash three times briefly (5-10 sec) with 10 ml TBS-T and then wash three times for 15 min with 15 ml TBS-T.Remove the membrane from the falcon tube and place on a clean, flat surface e.g., on a large weigh boat.Pipette 1 ml of ECL chemiluminescent substrate (1:1 ratio of A and B), making sure that all of the membrane is covered and leave for 1 min.Dab off excess ECL by touching the edge of the membrane against a paper towel and place on a sheet of transparent acetate (or some other transparent sheet) in a developing cassette.Layer another acetate sheet on top, taking care not to introduce bubbles.Seal edges with tape, close the lid and avoid exposing membrane to light.In a dark room, place x-ray film on membrane for 15 sec to 5 min depending on the signal.Pass the exposed film into the automatic developer and wait for it to come out at the other side.",
    "Notes: There may be lot-to-lot variation between antibodies, therefore it is good practice to validate the specificity of the anti-H3K18cr antibody (or whatever anti-acyl antibody used), e.g., using peptide dot blots.While we have not tested other image capturing systems as alternatives for the ECL/X-ray film setup, it is likely that such systems that can capture chemiluminescence are not only practical, but potentially even better suited than the use of x-ray films. Dot blotDot blot is more appropriate than Western blot when multiple reactions (more than 15) need to be analyzed. It allows all the reactions to be put on a single membrane, so that their spot intensities can be directly compared. Reactions must be spotted in quadruplicate to allow for variation in pipetting or spreading of the solution on the membrane. This protocol is described as required for Part I Procedure B3.Cut one a piece of nitrocellulose membrane for each of the A, B and C sets of reactions.Note: Cut a slightly larger piece that you think you need and trim it later. A typical size for a 10 x 12 spot grid once trimmed is 5.5 x 7.5 cm.Pipette 2 μl of the reactions using a P2 micropipette in quadruplicate in grid format as shown in Figure 3.Note: Hold the pipette steady and dispense liquid at an even rate to reduce variability in spots. Use a pencil to mark the grid as you go so that you can put the spots in a line. The consistency and speed of spotting may be improved by using a vacuum-based dot blot apparatus such as Bio-dot® from Bio-Rad. However, we have not tested such a device.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180713/20180713031314_3691.jpgFigure 3. Layout of reaction spots on a nitrocellulose membrane for dot blot assay. Placing the spots in this ordered way makes quantification easier later on.",
    "Allow spots to dry fully. This takes 5-10 min.Rinse briefly in transfer buffer and then with TBS-T.Continue with the Western blot protocol (Part II Procedure A) from Step A15, blocking the membrane.Note: It can be useful to use a larger volume of antibody as the pieces of membrane are bigger for this dot blot. Ten to fifteen milliliters is recommended for both primary and secondary antibody. The membrane pieces may be too large for a falcon tube, so a suitably sized tray could be used instead."
