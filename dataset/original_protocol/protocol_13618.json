    "All procedures for rabbit studies were performed with approval of University of Yamanashi Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Approved number: A28-39).\n1. Plasma separation from rabbit blood\nPrepare 1.5 mL microtubes containing 15 µL of 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0) for blood collection.\nPut a rabbit in a restrainer and puncture an auricular intermediate artery using a 22 gauge needle and collect blood into a tube. Mix the blood with EDTA gently and put them on ice.\nCentrifuge the blood tubes at 1,500 x g for 20 min at 4 °C and collect plasma to a new microtube.\n\tNOTE: 3 mL of blood is enough for collecting 1 mL plasma. If you collect blood from mice or other small animals, you need to pool them.\n2. Isolation of plasma lipoproteins\nNOTE: The schematic procedure is shown in Figure 1. The preparation method of potassium bromide (KBr) density solutions is shown in Table 1.\nTransfer 1 mL of plasma to a polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tube (Figure 2A).\nLoad these tubes in a fixed angle rotor and centrifuge the plasma at 356,000 x g for 2.5 h at 4 °C (Figure 2B).\n\tNOTE: For Beckman TLA 120.2 rotor, 356,000 x g (average relative centrifugal field, Av RCF) corresponds to 100,000 rpm.\nCut the tubes using a slicer and then collect the top fraction [VLDL (d<1.006 g/mL)], approximately 200 µL into a new microtube (Figure 2C). Collect the remaining bottom fraction into a new polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tube for the next separation (Figure 2D). Measure the volume and make the total volume to 800 µL by adding the same density solution (d=1.006 g/mL).",
    "NOTE: Set up a blade to the tube slicer. Adjust the position of the blade at a level between the top fraction (200 µL) and the bottom fraction (800 µL). The viscous precipitant in the bottom fraction should be collected carefully and completely by pipetting in all following steps. If pause, do so after separating the top and bottom fraction in all steps. Store the sample at 4°C until the next centrifugation.\nAdjust the bottom fraction (total 800 µL) to d=1.02 g/mL by adding 58.9 µL of d=1.21 g/mL solution and 141.1 µL of d=1.02 g/mL solution (the total volume is 1 mL).\nLoad these tubes in fixed angle rotor and centrifuge at 356,000 x g for 2.5 h at 4 °C.\nCut the tubes using a slicer and then collect the top fraction [IDL (d=1.02 g/mL)] approximately 200 µL into a new microtube. Collect the remaining bottom fraction into a new polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tube for the next separation. Measure the volume and make the total volume to 800 µL by adding the same density solution (d=1.02 g/mL).\nAdjust the bottom fraction (total 800 µL) to d=1.04 g/mL by adding 94.1 µL of d=1.21 g/mL solution and 105.9 µL of d=1.04 g/mL solution (the total volume is 1 mL).\nLoad these tubes in a fixed angle rotor and centrifuge at 356,000 x g for 2.5 h at 4 °C.\nCut the tubes using a slicer and then collect the top fraction [LDL (d=1.04 g/mL)] approximately 200 µL into a new microtube. Collect the remaining bottom fraction into a new polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tube for the next separation. Measure the volume and make the total to 800 µL by adding the same density solution (d=1.04 g/mL).",
    "Adjust the bottom fraction (total 800 µL) to d=1.06 g/mL by adding 106.7 µL of d=1.21 g/mL solution and 93.3 µL of d=1.06 g/mL solution (the total volume is 1 mL).\nLoad these tubes in a fixed angle rotor and centrifuge at 356,000 x g for 2.5 h at 4 °C.\nCut the tubes using a slicer and then collect the top fraction [LDL (d=1.06 g/mL)] approximately 200 µL into a new microtube. Collect the remaining bottom fraction into a new polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tube for the next separation. Measure the volume and make the total to 800 µL by adding the same density solution (d=1.06 g/mL).\nAdjust the bottom fraction (total 800 µL) to d=1.08 g/mL by adding 123.1 µL of d=1.21 g/mL solution and 76.9 µL of d=1.08 g/mL solution (the total volume is 1 mL).\nLoad these tubes in a fixed angle rotor and centrifuge at 356,000 x g for 2.5 h at 4 °C.\nCut the tubes using a slicer and then collect the top fraction [HDL2 (d=1.08 g/mL)] approximately 200 µL into a new microtube. Collect the remaining bottom fraction into a new polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tube for the next separation. Measure the volume and make the total to 800 µL by adding the same density solution (d=1.08 g/mL).\nAdjust bottom fraction (total 800 µL) to d=1.10 g/mL by adding 145.5 µL of d=1.21 g/mL solution and 54.5 µL of d=1.10 g/mL solution (the total volume is 1 mL).\nLoad these tubes in a fixed angle rotor and centrifuge at 356,000 x g for 2.5 h at 4 °C.",
    "Cut the tubes using a slicer and then collect the top fraction [HDL2 (d=1.10 g/mL)] approximately 200 µL into a new microtube. Collect the remaining bottom fraction into a new polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tube for the next separation. Measure the volume and make the total to 800 µL by adding the same density solution (d=1.10 g/mL).\nAdjust bottom fraction (total 800 µL) to d=1.21 g/mL by adding 0.140 g of potassium bromide (KBr) powder and dissolve it completely. Measure the volume and make them to 1 mL by adding d=1.21 g/mL solution.\nLoad these tubes in fixed angle rotor and centrifuge at 513,000 x g for 4 h at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: For Beckman TLA 120.2 rotor, 513,000 x g (Av RCF) corresponds to 120,000 rpm.\nCut the tubes using a slicer and then collect the top fraction [HDL3 (d=1.21 g/mL)] approximately 200 µL into a new microtube. This is the last step for ultracentrifugation.\n3. Dialysis\nNOTE: Because the density fractions (except d<1.006 g/mL fraction) contain high concentrations of KBr, it is necessary to remove them by dialysis.\nTransfer the density fractions to a dialysis tubing and clip both ends with closures.\nDialyze against 2 L of dialysis buffer such as PBS/ 1 mM EDTA for 6 h at 4 °C with agitation using a magnetic stirrer.\nReplace with new buffer and dialyze again for another 6 h at 4 °C.\nCollect the density fractions and measure the volume. Adjust all of the density fractions to the same volume (e.g., 250 µL).\n\tNOTE: You can calculate the concentrated factor from 1 mL of original plasma (e.g., 250 µL of density fraction corresponds to four times concentration).\n4. Analysis of lipoproteins",
    "NOTE: After dialysis, these lipoproteins are ready for different analyses. Lipoproteins can be evaluated by measuring either lipids or apolipoproteins or both. For measuring lipid contents such as total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), phospholipids (PL), and free cholesterol (FC) in each fraction, we use commercial enzymatic colorimetric assay kits. For analysis of apolipoproteins, we use SDS-PAGE visualized with CBB staining or Western blotting.\nLipid analysis\n\tNOTE: Lipids such as TC, TG, PL and FC in the lipoprotein fraction can be measured using commercially available measurement kits. The procedures depend on the reagents used, so follow the instructions of each kit used. Here we show a typical microplate assay using a commercial enzymatic assay kit.\n\t\nApply 8 μL of lipoprotein sample and standard calibration substance on 96-well microplate.\nAdd 240 μL of assay reagent and mix by pipetting.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 10 min.\nMeasure the OD with a microplate reader and calculate lipid concentrations.\nApolipoprotein analysis\n\t\nSDS-PAGE and CBB staining\n\t\t\nSample preparation: Add 10 μL of 2x Sample buffer to 10 μL of lipoprotein fraction. Heat the mixture at 80 °C for 5 min using a dry heat block.\nPrepare 4-20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel and set up the gel on the electrophoresis chamber filled with running buffer.\nLoad lipoprotein sample (10 μL/lane) and protein standards (5 μL/ lane) on the stacking gel.\n\t\t\tNOTE: If the samples are two times concentrated, an equivalent amount of 20 μL plasma will be analyzed per lane.]\nRun electrophoresis at 20–40 mA constant current.\nCBB staining: Soak the gel twice in fixing solution with gentle shaking for 10 min. Stain the gel with CBB staining solution for 30 min. Rinse the gel in distilled water to remove the excess stain. The gel is ready for photographing.\nWestern blotting",
    "Perform electrophoresis in the same procedure as described above.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The volume of lipoproteins loaded for the Western blotting is less than for CBB staining described above (e.g. 1–5 μL).\nPlace the gel and PVDF membrane between transfer buffer-soaked filter paper and form pad. Set up the sandwich in a holder cassette and place in a tank filled with transfer buffer.\nPerform electroblotting at 100 mA constant current for 3 h at 4 °C.\nBlocking: Incubate the membrane in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C.\nPrimary Ab reaction: Incubate the membranes in the primary Abs diluted with blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with mild shaking.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Suggested primary Ab dilution is shown in the Table of Materials. Three kinds of primary Abs against apolipoproteins can be used singly or in cocktails.\nWash the membrane three times in washing buffer with agitation, 5 min per wash.\nSecondary Ab reaction: Incubate the membrane in the secondary Abs diluted with blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature with agitation.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Suggested secondary Ab dilution is shown in the Table of Materials.\nWash the membrane three times in washing buffer with agitation, 5 min per wash.\nECL detection: Place the membrane on a plastic wrap. Add ECL detection reagents and incubate for 1 min. Drain excess liquid and seal the membrane in a bag.\nVisualize the signals using an image analyzer.\nSubscription Required.
