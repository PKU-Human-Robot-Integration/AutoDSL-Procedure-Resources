    "All animal experiments are performed according to the protocols approved by the University of Southern California (USC) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), and all methods are carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines, regulations, and recommendations.\n1. Animals\nObtain approval from appropriate animal care committees for the study.\nSet the vivarium to a dark-light 12 h cycle with controlled temperature and humidity between 24 ± 2 °C and 50%-60%, respectively.\nObtain male and/or female wild type C57BL/6 mice aged 6-8 weeks. After stratifying the animals by sex, randomly assign them to one of the following groups: 1) group house with vehicle treatment; 2) group house with drug treatment; 3) social isolation with vehicle treatment; or 4) social isolation with drug treatment. Aim for at least four mice per group per sex (ideally six mice per group).\nUpon arrival of the mice, acclimate them to the vivarium for at least 24 h. The mice should arrive singly housed.\n2. Cage setup\nFor social isolation animals, take a standard mouse cage (75 in2 floor space) and add half the amount of bedding and a 1 in2 piece of cotton (or equivalent) for nesting.\nWrap the outside walls of the cages in opaque, black plastic bags (or equivalent) and secure using tape. Make sure the mice cannot see the outside environment or surrounding animals.\n\t\nLeave the top and bottom of the cage unwrapped, unless the mice can see neighboring animals through them.\nWhen wrapping, ensure that no segment of the bag is accessible from the inside of the cage. This is to prevent the animal from tearing the bag apart.\nDo not include any form of environmental enrichment, such as toys or running wheels.\nCarefully and gently place the mice in the prepared cages. Provide food and water ad libitum.",
    "House control mice in groups of two or three under normal caging conditions (i.e., in a standard mouse cage [75 in2 floor space], a full amount of bedding, a 2 in2 piece of cotton or equivalent for nesting, and no wrapping of opaque bags).\n\t\nEnsure the group-housed mice are compatible with each other (i.e., there are no fighting/conflicts between them). If conflict occurs, remove the aggressor and exclude from the analysis.\nSeparate male and female mice housing and keep distance between the males and females to avoid the possibility of affecting the endocrine level changes of female mice due to their ability to smell.\n3. Care and treatment during the social isolation period\nDisturb the mice as minimally as possible during the social isolation period. Perform any procedures and activities, such as cage changes and treatment administration, during their active period (i.e., during the dark cycle) and under minimal noise disturbances.\nChange the cages only once a week during the dark cycle. The same plastic bag can be removed and rewrapped to new cages, unless significant damage is present.\n\t\nFor control (group housed) mice, change the cages twice a week or more as necessary during the dark cycle.\nEnsure the mice have plenty of water and food to last at least 1 week.\nContinue isolating (or group housing) the mice for at least 4 weeks to see optimal results.\n4. Agar drug/treatment preparation-a noninvasive drug treatment\nIf treatments (e.g., drugs under investigation) are involved in the study, ideally administer the treatment with as little handling as possible, by utilizing agar forms. Routes such as injection and oral gavage inflict additional stress on the mice that may become a confounding factor of anxiety.\nAdjust the timing and frequency of treatment based on the nature of the drug used.",
    "NOTE: In this study, 2 mg/kg dihydromyricetin (DHM, [(2R,3R)-3,5,7-trihydroxy-2-(3,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl)-2,3-dihydrochromen-4-one]) was used as the treatment. DHM was administered daily, in a single dose, during the dark phase of the last 2 weeks of the isolation (or group house) period.\nTo prepare the treatment, add 3% (w/v) agar in deionized (DI) water and heat to ~90 °C to dissolve. The solution will bubble. Prevent spillage or boiling over.\n\tNOTE: Heat the solution in a glass flask via short, 10 s intervals of microwaving.\n\tCAUTION: The glassware will be hot. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling the solution.\nSwirl the solution and visually ensure a homogenous solution.\n\tNOTE: The solution should be translucent and light yellow to light brown in coloration.\nWhile the solution is still warm, add 5% (w/v) sucrose and the desired dose of treatment. Only add sucrose and do not add the treatment of interest to the vehicle control.\nSwirl the solution and visually ensure a homogenous solution. Then, pour the solution into a mold and let cool at room temperature to solidify. If the treatment is light-sensitive, make sure to protect it from light.\n\tNOTE: The solution should be slightly viscous.\nOnce solidified, cut the agar into cubes of 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm and store at 4 °C until administration.\nTo administer the treatment, place a single cube onto a small weigh boat. During the dark phase of the light-dark cycle, quietly and carefully place the agar-weigh boat into individual cages, without touching the mouse. Allow the mouse to consume the agar.\n\tNOTE: Mice typically spend 15-45 min to completely consume the agar.\nConfirm complete consumption of the agar and then carefully remove the weigh boat from the cage. Repeat as necessary.\nPrepare agar cubes weekly to keep fresh and avoid any contamination.",
    "5. Behavior analysis\nPerform behavioral tests 24 h after the last day of the 4 week (or more) isolation period. Conduct tests during the dark phase under indirect red lighting and record with a video camera.\nArrange at least three individuals to conduct manual offline scoring in a double-blinded manner to minimize bias and error.\nElevated plus maze (EPM)\n\t\nPrepare the EPM apparatus. The apparatus used in this protocol was obtained commercially (see Table of Materials) and made of opaque plastic with two open arms and two closed arms (33 cm x 5 cm each, open arms perpendicular to the closed arms) with a center platform of 5 cm x 5 cm. Elevate the apparatus 50 cm above the floor.\nPlace the animal on the center of the apparatus, facing an open arm. Allow the animal to explore for 5 min and record their activity using a video camera.\n\t\t\nClean the apparatus after each animal by thoroughly wiping all surfaces with disinfectant (70% ethyl alcohol). Ensure that all rodent droppings are wiped off.\nScore the mice's behavior offline based on time spent in open arms, closed arms, and the center platform using a stopwatch. Start the stopwatch when the mouse places at least three paws in the respective arm or platform.\nOpen field (OF) test\n\t\nPrepare the OF apparatus. The apparatus used in this protocol (see Table of Materials) was made of opaque plastic measuring 50 cm x 50 cm x 38 cm (length x width x height).\nDraw square grids (10 cm x 10 cm each) on the field for a total of 25 grids.\nPlace the animal on the center of the field and allow to explore for 10 min. Record their activity on a video camera.",
    "Clean the apparatus after each animal by thoroughly wiping all surface with disinfectant (70% ethyl alcohol). Ensure that all rodent droppings are wiped off.\nScore the mice's behavior offline based on the time spent in the central zone, time spent in the corners, total distance traveled, and number of times the mouse reared.\n\t\t\nUse a stopwatch to record the time spent in the center or corner. Start the stopwatch when the mouse places at least three paws in the respective area.\nUse a counter to record the distance traveled and frequency of rearing. Count the number of squares the mouse enters (when the mouse places at least three paws in the square). Count rearing when the mouse clearly stands up on its hind paws. Do not count when the mouse stands up and leans against the walls or when it stands up to groom.\nNovel object recognition (NOR) test\n\t\nPerform this test over 3 days. On day 1, prepare an open field apparatus of 50 cm x 50 cm x 38 cm (length x width x height). Place the animal in the center of the open field and allow to familiarize for 5 min. Then place the animal back in its home cage.\n\t\t\nClean the apparatus after each animal by thoroughly wiping all surfaces with disinfectant (70% ethyl alcohol). Ensure that all rodent droppings are wiped off.\nOn day 2, prepare the same open field apparatus and place two identical objects, such as a small cube. Place them symmetrically about 20 cm apart. Place the animal in the center of the apparatus and allow to explore for 5 min. Then place the animal back in its home cage.",
    "Clean the apparatus after each animal by thoroughly wiping all surfaces with disinfectant (70% ethyl alcohol). Ensure that all rodent droppings are wiped off.\nOn day 3, prepare the same open field apparatus and one of the objects from day 2 (i.e., small cube), which will function as the familiar object. Place another, dissimilar novel object, such as a wooden pyramid, symmetrically from the familiar object about 20 cm apart. Allow the animal to explore for 3 min and record their activity on a video camera.\n\t\t\nClean the apparatus after each animal by thoroughly wiping all surfaces with disinfectant (70% ethyl alcohol). Ensure that all rodent droppings are wiped off.\nScore the mice's behavior offline based on the time spent exploring the familiar object and the novel object. Calculate the object recognition index (ORI%), where imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64567/64567eq01.jpg; tf and tn represent the times of exploring the familiar and novel objects, respectively.\nNovel context recognition (NCR) test\n\t\nPerform this test over 2 days. Prepare two distinctly shaped open fields and two pairs of distinctly shaped objects. The OF apparatus can be used as one of the contexts (open field). The other context should be of similar size but different shape, such as a round open field.\nOn day 1, place one pair of identical objects (i.e., two cubes) in the square context and the other pair of identical objects (i.e., two pyramids) in the round context. Objects should be placed symmetrically 15-20 cm apart.\nPlace the animal in the center and allow to explore for 5 min in one context. Repeat in the other context. Then, place the animal back in its home cage.\n\t\t\nClean the apparatus after each animal by thoroughly wiping all surfaces with disinfectant (70% ethyl alcohol). Ensure that all rodent droppings are wiped off.",
    "On day 2, swap one of the objects from one context with the other (i.e., place one cube and one pyramid in the square context, and one cube and one pyramid in the round context).\nPlace the animal in the center and allow to explore for 3 min. Record their activity on a video camera. The animals do not need to be recorded in both contexts.\n\t\t\nClean the apparatus after each animal by thoroughly wiping all surfaces with disinfectant (70% ethyl alcohol). Ensure that all rodent droppings are wiped off.\nScore the mice's behavior offline based on the time spent exploring the distinct objects. Calculate the recognition index (RI%) as the proportion of time spent investigating the novel \"out-of-context\" object (i.e., the pyramid in the square context) versus the familiar \"in-context\" object (i.e., the cube in the square context). imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64567/64567eq02.jpg.\nSubscription Required.
