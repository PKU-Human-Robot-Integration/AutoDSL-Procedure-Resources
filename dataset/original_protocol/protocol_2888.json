    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nNote: Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] shows an overall schematic of the workflow from the generation of bacmid to the frozen aliquots of purified recombinant human tubulin.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/26-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Overall Schematic of the Workflow in This Protcol\nFor each stage (dotted box), the expected finish time and the corresponding steps are annotated.\nOptional: Prepare baculovirus following Invitrogen’s Bac-to-Bac manual (Invitrogen MAN0000414 A.0) and skip to “Infection of High Five Insect Cells.” However, we use a slightly modified version of the Bac-to-Bac protocol, described below. In theory, both methods should produce similar protein expression results.\nDH10Bac Transformation\nTiming: 3 days\nGenerate the DH10Bac strains that contain the expression bacmid with the α- and β-tubulin genes of interest.\nTransform 3 μL of a pFastBac Dual donor plasmid (∼500 ng/μL) that encodes the codon-optimized α- and β-tubulin genes into 100 μL of DH10Bac competent cells. Plate the cells onto DH10Bac LB agar plates. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 day.\nPick one white colony to streak onto another DH10Bac LB agar plate. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 day.\nInoculate 6 mL of LB medium containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin, 7 μg/mL gentamycin, and 10 μg/mL tetracycline with cells from step 2 (no need to isolate a single colony at this step). Incubate the culture at 37°C and 230 rpm orbital rotation for about 18 h.\nOptional: Pick two white colonies in Step 2 in case there is a problem downstream (e.g., transfected cell culture obtains microbial contamination). In Step 3, inoculate one 6 mL LB culture with cells from each individual white colony.\nOptional: For Step 1 and Step 2, an extra day of incubation at 37°C can be helpful to distinguish the blue colonies from the white colonies.\nBacmid Preparation\nTiming: 2 h for two samples",
    "Isolate the expression bacmid from the DH10Bac strains.\nCritical: Handle the DNA solution gently. Do not use a vortex to mix the solution. Use a P1000 pipette to transfer the DNA solution with minimum pipetting.\nOptional: Use the P1, P2, and N3 buffers from the Qiagen plasmid miniprep kit. In our hands, using either the home-made buffer or the Qiagen buffer generates bacmid with comparable quality.\nHarvest the cells from Step 3 at 4,000 rcf for 10 min at 4°C.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 250 μL of P1 buffer. Transfer the cells to a new 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 250 μL of P2 buffer into the cell suspension and mix by inverting the tube 4-6 times.\nAdd 350 μL of N3 buffer into the cell suspension and mix by inverting the tube 4-6 times.\nCentrifuge the cell lysate at 21,000 rcf for 10 min at room temperature.\nTransfer the supernatant to a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube and add 1 mL of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v). Mix by inverting the tube 4-6 times.\nCentrifuge at 21,000 rcf for 2 min at room temperature.\nTransfer the upper aqueous phase to a new 2 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nRepeat Step 9 to 11 twice. Transfer the aqueous phase to a new 2 mL microcentrifuge tube and add 1 mL of anhydrous chloroform. Mix by inverting the tube 4-6 times.\nCentrifuge at 21,000 rcf for 2 min at room temperature.\nTransfer the final aqueous phase (∼750 μl) to a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube. Add 10% volume of 8 M lithium chloride. Mix by tapping the bottom of the tube.\nAdd 2.5 mL of 100% ethanol. Incubate on ice for 20 min.\nCentrifuge at 4,000 rcf for 20 min at 4°C. Aspirate the supernatant.",
    "Gently resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of ice-cold 80% (v/v) ethanol. Transfer the solution to a new 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube. Centrifuge at 21,000 rcf for 10 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant. Air dry the purified bacmid pellet at room temperature for at least 30 min. Cover the microcentrifuge tubes with a sheet of plastic wrap to minimize airborne contamination.\nDissolve the dried pellet in 50 μL sterile Milli-Q water. Quantify the DNA concentration and estimate the quality by measuring the absorption at 260 nm (A 260) and at 280 nm (A 280). In general, the DNA concentration should be ∼6 μg/μL with an A 260/A280 of ∼2.0.\nOptional: Use ultrapure water from other water purifying systems that purify water to the same quality as the Milli-Q systems.\nOptional: Use primers that flank the α- or β-tubulin genes to confirm the tubulin genes are in the bacmid via PCR. A protocol can be found in Invitrogen’s Bac-to-Bac manual. The PCR products can also be purified and sent for Sanger DNA sequencing.\nPause Point: The purified bacmid DNA can be stored at 4°C for up to 1 week.\nGenerating the Recombinant Baculovirus\nTiming: 6 h for transfection. 1 week for generating P3 virus stock\nTransfect the expression bacmid into Sf9 cells to generate baculovirus.\nFor transfection and virus production, Sf9 cells should be in log phase (2∼2.5x106  cells/mL) at the time of plating. The following steps are for transfection of one construct:\nTransfection\nPlate 9x105  Sf9 cells into two 9.5 cm 2 flat-bottom wells of a 6-well plate. Incubate at 27°C for 1 h to allow cell attachment. During this time, continue to step 21.\nDilute 12 μg of purified bacmid DNA into 200 μl of serum- and antibiotic-free Sf-900 II medium in a sterilized 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube.",
    "Mix Cellfectin II Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) by inverting the Cellfectin stock tube 6 times. In a sterilized 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube, dilute 12 μl of Cellfectin II into 200 μl of serum- and antibiotic-free Sf-900 II medium.\nCombine the diluted bacmid and Cellfectin II reagent. Mix gently by tapping the microcentrifuge tube. Incubate at room temperature for 45 min.\nFor the attached Sf9 cells from Step 20, aspirate the medium and then rinse each well with 2 mL of serum- and antibiotic-free Sf-900 II medium. After aspirating the washing medium, add 0.8 mL of serum- and antibiotic-free Sf-900 II medium per well.\nAdd the bacmid:Cellfectin II mixture (∼206 μl per well) to the attached Sf9 cells. Incubate at 27°C for 5 h.\nAspirate the medium and add 2 mL of Sf-900 II medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and 1% (v/v) Antibiotic-Antimycotic per well. Incubate at 27°C for 72 h.\nHarvest P1 Virus\nResuspend the cells with a 5 mL serological pipette. Combine the cell culture from both wells to a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube. Centrifuge at 1,000 rcf for 5 min at room temperature.\nFilter the supernatant through a sterilized 25 mm diameter syringe filter with a 0.45 μm pore size polyethersulfone membrane into another 15 mL conical centrifuge tube. This is the P1 virus stock.\nGenerate P2 Virus\nPlate 9x106 Sf9 cells into a 75 cm2 vented cap tissue culture flask. Incubate at 27°C for 1 h to allow cell attachment.\nReplace medium with 23 mL of Sf-900 II medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and 1% (v/v) Antibiotic-Antimycotic. Add 2 mL of the P1 virus and incubate at 27°C for 60 h.",
    "Resuspend the cells with a 10 mL serological pipette. Transfer the cell culture to a 50 mL conical centrifuge tube. Centrifuge at 1,000 rcf for 5 min at room temperature.\nFilter the supernatant through a sterilized 25 mm diameter syringe filter with a 0.45 μm pore size polyethersulfone membrane into another 50 mL conical centrifuge tube. This is the P2 virus stock.\nCritical: Wrap the 50 mL conical centrifuge tube with a sheet of aluminum foil. For long-term storage, keep the virus stock at 4°C and protect from light.\nPause Point: The P2 virus stock can be stored at 4°C for up to 2 years.\nGenerate P3 Virus\nPlate 9x106 Sf9 cells into a 75 cm2 vented cap tissue culture flask. Incubate at 27°C for 1 h to allow cell attachment.\nAspirate the medium, add 1 mL of P2 virus and 24 mL of Sf-900 II medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and 1% (v/v) Antibiotic-Antimycotic. Incubate at 27°C for 60 h.\nResuspend the cells with a 10 mL serological pipette. Transfer the cell culture to a 50 mL conical centrifuge tube. Centrifuge at 1,000 rcf for 5 min at room temperature.\nFilter the supernatant through a sterilized 25 mm diameter syringe filter with a 0.45 μm pore size polyethersulfone membrane into another 50 mL conical centrifuge tube. This is the P3 virus stock.\nCritical: Wrap the 50 mL conical centrifuge tube with a sheet of aluminum foil. Store the virus stock at 4°C and protected from light.\nPause Point: The P3 virus stock can be stored at 4°C for ∼6 months.",
    "Optional: To verify the expression of recombinant tubulin, we use liquid nitrogen to flash freeze the infected Sf9 cell pellets that produce the P3 virus and then use the following protocol to check for protein expression in these cells by western blot.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of lysis buffer (1X BRB80, 0.1% (w/v) Tween-20, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 3 U/mL benzonase, and 1X Roche EDTA-free mini protease inhibitor). Transfer the cell suspension to a 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube. Incubate on ice for 20 min.\nCentrifuge the cell lysate at 21,000 rcf for 10 min at 4°C.\nUse 15 μL of sample to run a western blot analysis using primary antibodies against α- or β-tubulin. After secondary antibody and image development, there should be two individual bands at ∼50 kD. By comparing to the western blot analysis of uninfected Sf9 cells, we have found that the lower band corresponds to the endogenous insect tubulin, and the upper band corresponds to the recombinant α-tubulin with the decahistidine tag or the recombinant β-tubulin with the Strep-tag II (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/26-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Immunoblot Analysis of Tubulin Expression in Sf9 Cells\n(A and B) The Sf9 cells harvested after generating human α1B/β3-tubulin P3 virus. Antibody against α-tubulin (A) or β-tubulin (B) was used for western blots (WB).\n(C and D) The infected (lane 1) and the uninfected control Sf9 cells (lane 2). Antibody against α-tubulin (C) or β-tubulin (D) was used for western blots (WB).\nInfecting High Five Cells for Protein Expression\nTiming: 60 h\nExpress the α- and β-tubulin of interest in High Five cells.\nCritical: Always plan to use freshly harvested cells for the tubulin purification. Using freeze-thawed cell pellets will likely reduce the protein yield.",
    "Critical: Time the infection such that the tubulin purification can be completed as quickly as possible once the cells are ready. We typically infect at 5 PM so that 3 days later we can start the purification early in the morning and complete the purification within a 12-14 hr window.\nWhen High Five cell density is at 2.5∼3.5x106 cells/mL, add 6 mL of P3 virus per 600 mL of cell culture. Incubate the infected insect cell culture at 27°C and 110 rpm orbital rotation for 60 h.\nOptional: As with any untested protein purification strategy, generating recombinant tubulin other than human α1B/β2B- and α1B/β3-tubulin may require time-course experiments to determine the infection time that maximizes protein yield. However, the procedure outlined here can act as a good starting point.\nPurification of Recombinant Tubulin\nTiming: 14 h from cell lysis to frozen aliquots of recombinant tubulin stored at −80°C\nIsolate affinity tag-free recombinant α/β-tubulin heterodimers.\nCritical: Perform all the following steps in a cold room or on ice.\nCritical: Pre-chill the buffers, glass containers, plastic tubes, pipettes, filters, and syringes in a cold room or on ice.\nCell Lysis\nTiming: 1 h for cells from 1.2 L of culture\nHarvest cells by centrifugation at 1,000 rcf for 10 min at 4°C",
    "Critical: Because it can be time consuming to determine the titer for every new batch of virus, keep an eye on the size of cell pellet to adjust the volume of P3 virus for cell infection. For every 600 mL of cell culture, we usually obtain 15∼20 mL of insect cell pellet. If the cell pellet is much smaller (<15 mL) and the supernatant (containing medium) is very turbid, the virus titer might be too high. Reduce the volume of the P3 virus used for infection. Please see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] for the representative images of the supernatant and the cell pellet harvested from 1.2 L of culture.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/26-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Representative Images of the Harvested High Five Cell\n(A) Harvested cell pellets and supernatant (600 mL of cell culture for each bottle). (B) The supernatant from 1.2 L of cell culture.\nFor cells harvested from 1.2 L of culture, add 5 μL of 25 U/μL benzonase and 2 tablets of Roche complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor to 40 mL of lysis buffer.\nUse a 10 mL serological pipette to resuspend the cell pellet with the lysis buffer supplemented with benzonase and protease inhibitor.\nLyse cells by 20 strokes of dounce homogenization on ice. We use a serrated Teflon pestle (Thomas C 4812).\nClarification\nTiming: 1.5 h\nCentrifuge the homogenized cell lysate at 55,000 rpm (∼222,000 rcf) in a Type 70 Ti rotor for 1 h at 4°C.\nCollect the supernatant with a 10 mL serological pipette. Avoid pipetting the bottom 25% of the supernatant (∼5 mL per centrifuge tube).\nSeparately collect the turbid bottom fraction of the supernatant into 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tubes. Centrifuge in a benchtop microcentrifuge at 21,000 rcf for 10 min at 4°C, then pool this supernatant with the rest from step 43.",
    "Use a 10 mL syringe to filter the supernatant through 33 mm diameter syringe filters with a 0.22 μm pore size polyethersulfone membrane. In general, one filter can clarify ∼10 mL of the supernatant.\nOptional: Take 20 μl of sample for SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis.\nNickel Affinity Chromatography\nTiming: 2 h\nEquilibrate two 1 mL HisTrap HP columns (GE Healthcare) connected in series with 4 mL of lysis buffer at 1 mL/min.\nLoad the 0.22 μm filtered cell lysate onto the columns at 1 mL/min (e.g., using a Superloop).\nOptional: Take 20 μl of sample from the flow-through from this step for SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis.\nWash the columns with at least 35 mL of lysis buffer, or until the UV absorption (A280 ) reaches baseline.\nElute with HisTrap elution buffer at 1 mL/min in 0.25 mL fractions. The fractions are collected in a multi-well microplate (Greiner cat# 655101).\nOptional: To minimize buffer consumption, leave pump A with the lysis buffer while pumping the HisTrap elution buffer through pump B.\nOptional: Elute the two columns separately. Together with the western blot analysis (see Expected Outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]), this strategy can help determine whether both HisTrap HP columns properly sequester decahistidine-tagged α-tubulin. This information can be useful for troubleshooting when the final yield is lower than expected (see Troubleshooting). Detach the second column and elute the first column until baseline, then attach the second column and continue the elution until baseline. See Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A for a typical elution profile we observe from the two 1 mL HisTrap HP columns.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/26-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

V0, void volume. 1CV, one column volume.\nCritical: The first ∼2-3 fractions eluted from the upstream HisTrap HP column after switching to HisTrap elution buffer are usually a bit turbid, which is likely due to residual cell debris/lipid contamination. To maximize yield, centrifuge these fractions in a benchtop microcentrifuge at 21,000 rcf for 1 min at 4°C and add this supernatant to the rest of the pooled eluate.\nPool all the fractions that have an A280 value above baseline into a chilled 50 mL conical tube. Estimate the volume of this eluate (typically ∼9 mL). To maximize yield, use ∼300 μl of lysis buffer to rinse out the wells of the fraction collection plate and add this to the eluate.\nDilute the pooled HisTrap eluate to ∼30 mL with lysis buffer.\nOptional: Take 20 μl of sample from the HisTrap eluate for SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis.\nCritical: Because we have noticed poor binding efficiency of the strep-tagged β-tubulin to the StrepTrap HP when the buffer contains 500 mM imidazole, it is critical to dilute the HisTrap eluate by ∼3-fold using lysis buffer. To prevent excessive dilution and minimize loading time in the following steps, the volume of the diluted protein solution should be limited to no more than 30 mL.\nStrep Tag II Affinity Chromatography\nTiming: 2 h\nEquilibrate two 1 mL StrepTrap HP columns (GE Healthcare) connected in series with 4 mL of buffer containing 66% lysis buffer (from pump A) and 34% HisTrap elution buffer (from pump B) at 1 mL/min.",
    "Filter the diluted HisTrap eluate from step 51 through a 33 mm diameter/0.22 μm pore size syringe polyethersulfone membrane filter.\nLoad the filtered protein solution onto the equilibrated StrepTrap HP columns using a Superloop at 1 mL/min.\nOptional: Take 20 μl of sample from the flow-through of the StrepTrap column for SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis.\nWash the columns with 4 mL of buffer containing 66% lysis buffer (from pump A) and 34% HisTrap elution buffer (from pump B) at 1 mL/min.\nWash the columns with 25 mL of strep wash buffer A (from pump B), followed by 25 mL of strep wash buffer B (from pump B) at 1 mL/min.\nCritical: Perform a ‘pump wash’ to prime pump B between changes of the wash buffer.\nWash the columns with 10 mL of lysis Buffer (from pump A) to get rid of baseline nucleotide signal at 1 mL/min.\nElute with strep elution buffer (from pump A) at 0.8 mL/min in 0.25 mL fractions. The fractions are collected in a multi-well microplate.\nOptional: Elute the two columns separately. Together with the western blot analysis (see Expected Outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]), this strategy can be useful if the final yield is lower than expected (e.g., if one of the StrepTrap HP columns has lost binding affinity; see Troubleshooting). Detach the second column and elute the first column until baseline, then attach the second column and continue the elution until baseline. See Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B for the elution profile from two 1 mL StrepTrap HP columns.\nOptional: Take 20 μl of sample from the eluate of the StrepTrap column for SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis.",
    "Pool all the fractions that have an A280 value above the baseline into a chilled 50 mL conical centrifuge tube (typically ∼7 mL). To maximize yield, use ∼300 μl of strep elution buffer to rinse out the wells of the collection plate. Dilute this eluate to ∼25 mL with strep elution buffer to reduce the extent of changes in the buffer composition in the following TEV digestion step.\nTEV Digestion\nTiming: 2.5 h\nCritical: As it is well-accepted that the polymerization activity of tubulin decreases over time, even on ice (Olmsted and Borisy, 1975[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]), we use an excessive amount (∼400% molar ratio) of TEV to remove the affinity tags from the majority of tubulin heterodimers within 2 hr.\nDilute ∼4 mg TEV (> 7 mg/mL stored in 40 mM HEPES, 150 mM KCl, 30% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mM MgCl2, and 3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5) into 5 mL of strep elution buffer. Add this TEV solution to the eluate from Step 59. Incubate on ice for 2 h. Mix gently every 10 min by inverting the tube 4-6 times.\nCritical: Be gentle with the protein solution at this step. Vigorous shaking or vortexing can lead to protein precipitation.\nOptional: Take 20 μl of sample for SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis.\nCation Exchange-Nickel Affinity Chromatography\nTiming: 1 h\nCentrifuge the digested protein at 4,000 rcf for 30 sec to bring all the liquid to the bottom of the tube.\nEquilibrate two 1 mL HiTrap SP columns connected in series and upstream of two 1 mL HisTrap HP columns with 5 mL of Strep elution buffer at 1 mL/min.\nFilter the digested protein from Step 61 through a 33 mm diameter/0.22 μm pore size syringe polyethersulfone membrane filter.",
    "Load the filtered protein solution onto the equilibrated HiTrap SP/HisTrap HP columns setup at 1 mL/min using a Superloop. Immediately start collecting the flow-through, which contains the recombinant tubulin. As the TEV is stored in a nucleotide-free buffer, the nucleotide concentration of the digested protein is ∼5% lower than the nucleotide concentration of the strep elution buffer. The concentration of tubulin in the flow-through is generally not high enough to compensate for the loss of UV absorbance due to nucleotide dilution. Therefore, the flow-through will typically have slightly lower UV absorbance than the strep elution buffer. Flow and collect another 10 mL of strep elution buffer through the columns to maximize protein recovery.\nFigure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C shows the chromatogram of the flow-through from HiTrap SP/HisTrap HP columns of purification with an above average yield of tubulin (∼4 mg from 1.2 L cell culture). The absorbance of the flow-through at 280 nm is slightly higher than the background absorbance of the strep elution buffer.\nOptional: Take 20 μl of sample from the flow-through for SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis.\nSize Exclusion Chromatography\nTiming: 3 h\nEquilibrate a Superdex 200 HiLoad 16/60 column with 130 mL of gel filtration buffer at 1 mL/min.\nPre-equilibrate a 15 mL 50 kDa MWCO centrifugal filter unit (Millipore UFC901024) with ice-cold gel filtration buffer.\nConcentrate the flow-through from Step 64 (∼40 mL) to less than 3 mL.\nLoad the concentrated protein solution from Step 67 onto the equilibrated Superdex 200 HiLoad 16/60 column at 1 mL/min.\nKeep flowing the gel filtration buffer through the column at 1 mL/min for one column volume. Tubulin dimers elute at ∼80-85 mL on this column (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D and 5E). Pool all the fractions that have an A280 value above the baseline into a 50 mL conical centrifuge tube.",
    "Optional: Take 20 μl of sample from the eluate of the size-exclusion column for SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis.\nMeasure the Protein Concentration and Storage\nTiming: 1 h\nConcentrate gel filtration eluate to less than 1 mL using another 50 kDa MWCO centrifugal filter unit pre-equilibrated in ice-cold gel filtration buffer. To determine the purity of the concentrated protein, take 1-5 μl sample for SDS-PAGE analysis. Typically, densitometric analysis of Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE gels indicates that the purity at this step is greater than 95%.\nMeasure the protein concentration by Bradford assay using BSA as a standard, or by absorption at 280 nm (ϵ280 = 115,000 M-1cm-1 and MW = 100 kDa). On average, this protocol should generate ∼3 mg of recombinant tubulin from 1.2 L of insect cell culture.\nSnap freeze small aliquots (∼20 μl) of concentrated protein in liquid nitrogen and store at −80°C."
