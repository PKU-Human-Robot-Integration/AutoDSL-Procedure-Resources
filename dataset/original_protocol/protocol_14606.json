    "Ethics statement: Lassa fever patients were recruited for this study using protocols approved by human subjects committees at Tulane University, Harvard University, Broad Institute, Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital (ISTH), Kenema Government Hospital (KGH), Oyo State Ministry of Health, Ibadan, Nigeria and Sierra Leone Ministry of Health. All patients were treated with a similar standard of care and were offered the drug Ribavirin, whether or not they decided to participate in the study. For Lassa fever (LF) patients, treatment with Ribavirin followed the currently recommended guidelines and was generally offered as soon as LF was strongly suspected.\nDue to the severe outbreak for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), patients could not be consented through our standard protocols. Instead use of clinical excess samples from EVD patients was evaluated and approved by Institutional Review Boards in Sierra Leone and at Harvard University. The Office of the Sierra Leone Ethics and Scientific Review Committee, the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation, and the Harvard Committee on the Use of Human Subjects have granted a waiver of consent to sequence and make publically available viral sequences obtained from patient and contact samples collected during the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone. These bodies also granted use of clinical and epidemiological data for de-identified samples collected from all suspected EVD patients receiving care during the outbreak response. The Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation also approved shipments of non-infectious, non-biological samples from Sierra Leone to the Broad Institute and Harvard University for genomic studies of outbreak samples.\n1. DNase-treatment of Sample RNA (Up to 55 µl Extracted Total RNA, ~4 hr)\nSet up the DNase reaction in a 96-well PCR plate on ice in a biosafety cabinet as described in Table 1, Step 1.1 (total volume, 70 µl/well). Note: A master mix can be prepared.",
    "Vortex gently and thoroughly, then centrifuge at 280 x g at RT for 1 min.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 30 min.\nCleanup using RNA Solid Phase Reversible Immobilization (SPRI) beads.\n\t\nWarm RNA beads to RT for 30 min.\nGently shake RNA beads bottle to resuspend any magnetic particles that may have settled. Add 1.8x volume (126 µl) of RNA beads to DNase-treated RNA (70 µl), mix by pipette 10 times and incubate for 5 min at RT (total volume in well, 196 µl).\nPlace mixture on the magnetic station. Wait for the solution to clear (5 - 10 min).\nRemove cleared solution while on the station by pipette and discard. While on station, wash beads by covering pellet with 70% ethanol and incubate for 1 min. Remove ethanol with pipette and discard. Repeat for a total of two washes.\n\t\tNote: Using precisely 70% freshly prepared ethanol is critical, as a higher percentage will result in inefficient washing of smaller-sized molecules, whereas <70% ethanol could cause loss of sample7.\nKeep plate on the station and leave open to air-dry. Note: Be sure to allow the beads to dry completely until beads begin to crack.\nAdd 55 µl of nuclease-free water to the plate to elute RNA. Remove plate from the station to mix the beads and water by pipetting thoroughly. Note: Alternatively, use less water (≤ 10 µl) in order to concentrate the total RNA.\nPlace plate back on the station. Wait until solution clears to transfer by pipette to new screw-cap tube for long-term storage (-80 °C). Place 5 µl RNA in new 96-well PCR plate for depletion (step. 2.4).\nOptional: Save and dilute 1 µl in 19 µl water (1:20) for qRT-PCR of rRNA (e.g., 18S, 28S rRNA) (Table 2) and viral markers5.",
    "2. Selective Depletion of Ribosomal and Carrier RNA from Viral RNA Sample (~4 hr)\nMake 5x hybridization and 10x RNase H reaction buffers, and nuclease-free water with linear acrylamide carrier as described in Table 1.\nSet up hybridization reaction by combining RNA with rRNA depletion oligos (Table 3) and oligo(dT) on ice in a 96-well PCR plate as described in Table 1.\n\tNote: A master mix can be prepared. 50 femtograms (fg) of a unique synthetic RNA (ERCCs8) can be added for tracking both the viral sequencing process and potential index read cross-contamination.\n\t\nVortex gently and thoroughly, then centrifuge at 280 x g at RT for 1 min.\n\t\tIncubate at 95 °C for 2 min, slow ramping to 45 °C at -0.1 °C per sec. Pause the thermocycler at 45 °C.\nSet up RNase H reaction mix on ice as described in Table 1, then preheat at 45 °C for 2 min. Note: A master mix can be prepared.\n\t\nAdd the pre-heated RNase H mix to the hybridization reaction in plate while keeping the plate in the thermocycler at 45 °C.\nMix well by gentle pipetting 6 - 8 times. Incubate at 45 °C for another 30 min. Place on ice.\nSet up the DNase reaction mix on ice as described in Table 1. Note: A master mix can be prepared.\n\t\nAdd to the RNase H reaction in plate, vortex gently and thoroughly, then centrifuge at 280 x g at RT for 1 min. Incubate at 37 °C for 30 min.\nStop DNase reaction by adding 5 µl 0.5 M EDTA. Vortex gently and thoroughly, then centrifuge at 280 x g at RT for 1 min.",
    "Cleanup using RNA beads (see step 1.3) using a 1.8x volume (144 µl) beads. Elute in 11 µl of nuclease-free water. Note: For safe cold storage, store depleted RNA samples at -80 °C O/N.\n3. cDNA Synthesis (~6 hr)\nMix rRNA/carrier-depleted RNA with random primers on ice in a 96-well PCR plate as described in Table 1, vortex gently and thoroughly, then centrifuge at 280 x g at RT for 1 min.\n\t\nHeat the mixture to 70 °C for 10 min in a thermocycler. Immediately after heat denaturation, place the RNA on ice for 1 - 5 min. Do not allow the RNA to stand (even on ice) for longer than 5 min prior to the first-strand reaction.\nSet up first-strand synthesis reaction mix on ice as described in Table 1.\n\tNote: A master-mix may be prepared.\n\t\nAdd to RNA/random primer mix in plate, vortex gently and thoroughly, then centrifuge at 280 x g at RT for 1 min. Incubate at 22 - 25 °C for 10 min.\nIncubate at 55 °C in an air incubator for 60 min. Place the plate on ice to terminate the reaction. Note: The use of an air incubator is recommended to create gradual warming of the first-strand reaction during which the primers anneal and the first strand begins to elongate.\nSet up second-strand synthesis reaction mix on ice as described in Table 1.\n\tNote: A master-mix may be prepared.\n\t\nAdd to the first-strand synthesis reaction in the plate, vortex gently and thoroughly, then centrifuge at 280 x g at RT for 1 min. Incubate for 2 hr at 16 °C (keep lid at 25 °C). Do not allow the temperature to rise above 16 °C.",
    "Place the plate on ice, then inactivate reaction by adding 5 µl of 0.5 M EDTA, mix gently and thoroughly, then centrifuge at 280 x g at RT for 1 min.\nCleanup with DNA beads (see step 1.3 for protocol) using 1.8x volume (153 µl) of beads. Elute in 9 µl of elution buffer (EB). Save 1 µl for quantification. Use 1 ng of cDNA for subsequent steps. If cDNA concentration is too low to detect, use 4 µl of cDNA for tagmentation (see step 4.1).\nFor safe cold storage, store double-stranded cDNA at 4 °C O/N or -20 °C for long-term storage.\n4. Library Preparation — DNA Library Construction (~4 hr)\nTransfer 4 µl of cDNA to a 96-well plate and save the remaining cDNA for a second attempt if needed.\nSet up the tagmentation reaction on ice as described in Table 1.\n\tNote: A master-mix may be prepared. To reduce background and overall cost, the total volume of the tagmentation reaction is reduced from 20 to 10 µl. As cDNA is the limiting factor, the amount of ATM (i.e., transposome) used in the reaction is also reduced to decrease the number of integration sites.\n\t\nAdd tagmentation mix to cDNA in the plate, vortex gently and thoroughly and centrifuge at 280 x g (at RT) for 1 min. Incubate at 55 °C for 5 min, hold at 10 °C.\nOnce at 10 °C, immediately add 2.5 µl of Neutralize Tagment Buffer (NT) to end the reaction. Mix by pipetting up and down, then centrifuge at 280 x g (at RT) for 1 min.\nIncubate at RT for 5 min.\nSet up PCR amplification reaction on ice as described in Table 1.\n\t\nVortex gently and thoroughly, then centrifuge at 280 x g at RT for 1 min.",
    "Perform PCR on thermocycler using the conditions described in Table 1.\n\t\tNote: 12 cycles of PCR are suggested for 1 ng of tagmented cDNA; however, viral clinical samples often have undetectable amounts of cDNA. For low amounts of cDNA (<1 ng), use up to 18 cycles of PCR to create enough library for sequencing.\nLibrary preparation — cleanup and pooling for sequencing\n\t\nBring sample up to 50 µl with EB.\nCleanup with DNA beads (see step 1.3 for protocol) using 0.6x volume (30 µl) beads. Elute in 15 µl EB.\nDetermine concentration of library (Figure 3) by conducting region analysis (150 to 1,000 bp) using bioanalyzer software9, excluding primer dimers (~120 bp) from region analysis. Note: Alternatively, qPCR can be used to quantify libraries 10.\nPool libraries at the lowest molar concentration of 1 nM or greater. If library is below 1 nM, add a small volume of library to pool (~1x volume of other libraries) to capture sequence information from these libraries.\nCleanup pool with 0.7x DNA beads as outlined above (see step 2). Elute in 15 µl EB. Note: Volume of beads will depend on the final volume of the pool.\nAnalyze pool9. Determine molar concentration by conducting region analysis (150 to 1,000 bp)9. Note: Alternatively, qPCR can be used to quantify library pool 10.\nLoad sequencer at 10 pM library concentration to generate 101 bp, paired-end reads with dual barcode reads11.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54117/54117fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.
