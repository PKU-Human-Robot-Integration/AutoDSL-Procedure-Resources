    "RNA extraction with PureLink RNA Mini kit We optimized RNA extraction for neuronal cultures. Previously, cells were dissociated from the culture well and then pelleted before lysis for RNA extraction (Srinivasaraghavan et al., 2022). However, RNA in axons and dendrites is lost as cells detach and round up during dissociation, resulting in only capturing RNA from the cell soma. Alternatively, TRIzol can be used to extract RNA but risks phenol contamination due to its manual pipetting of the separated supernatant layer. Use the protocol according to the manufacturer's instructions [section titled \"Purifying RNA from Animal and Plant Cells\" (LifeTechnologies, 2012)] with the following modifications:Instead of performing “Lysis and Homogenization” steps, perform the following:Aspirate culture media from adherent cells.Wash twice with PBS. Bring culture plate to RNA extraction lab bench.Note: RNA extraction should be performed on a separate bench from cell culture and other assays to avoid RNAse contamination from surfaces. Clean and wipe down all surfaces, have a dedicated set of pipettes for RNA work, and use RNAse/DNAse-free plastic consumables, especially if working close to DNA extraction kits with RNAse. Aspirate PBS and add 300 μL of lysis buffer (containing 2-mercaptoethanol) for each 6-well plate (9.6 cm2). Discard PBS into the liquid waste container containing 10% bleach.Ensure lysis buffer has lysed all cells on the plate (liquid is slimy/viscous and has no precipitate or cell pellet) and then transfer to homogenization tubes.Note: Do not wait more than ~5 min to process the sample through the homogenization tubes, as this might reduce RNA yield. Spin homogenization tubes in the centrifuge at 12,000× g for 2 min.Proceed with \"Binding, Washing, and Elution steps\" with the cell lysate.Elution of RNA and aliquoting Add 30 μL of nuclease-free water to the cartridge.Incubate at room temperature for 1 min.",
    "Centrifuge at 12,000× g for 2 min.Repeat steps 1–3 with eluted RNA.Measure RNA content Measure RNA concentration with a Nanodrop or comparable spectrophotometer.Clean Nanodrop surface with nuclease-free water.Add 1 μL of a blank (nuclease-free water).Wipe off the water drop.Add 1 μL of purified RNA to the Nanodrop surface. Close the lid and press Analyze.Repeat steps c–d for each sample. High-quality RNA has an A260/A280 absorbance ratio of ~2.0 and an A260/A230 ratio of ~2.2.Note: Low-yield RNA samples can be eluted a second time through the spin column, if samples were not incubated for 1 min prior to centrifugation. Low-quality RNA is usually a result of either RNA degradation or other compounds contaminating the sample from previous steps. For more troubleshooting, see the Troubleshooting section of the PureLink manual (LifeTechnologies, 2012). Important: Aliquot RNA into 1 μg aliquots to avoid freeze-thaw cycles.Eliminate gDNA contamination with DNase I treatment Use protocol as outlined in the previous protocol (Srinivasaraghavan et al., 2022). Perform on each 1 μg aliquot.Generate cDNA with a High-Capacity cDNA rev Transcription kit Use protocol as outlined in the previous protocol (Srinivasaraghavan et al., 2022).It is recommended to dilute cDNA to a 10 ng/μL working concentration.Primer design and automated primer plating Primer design All primer design conditions are the same as previously described (Srinivasaraghavan et al., 2022), except for using the command-line version of the Primer3 software. Once set up, the command-line interface of Primer3 eliminates user error, generates primer pairs for different genes much more quickly, and automates the primer selection process. The use of the command-line interface is beyond this protocol's scope, but a few commands are needed to get started (Table 2).Table 2. Basic command line functions to help with installing/using Primer3 table:",
    "﻿Action,Command\nShow current working directory,pwd\nEnter a folder/directory,cd *name of folder*\nMove up a folder/directory (exit a folder),cd ..\nList folder contents,ls\nMake a new folder,mkdir *name of folder\nDelete file,rm *name of file*\nTab,Autocomplete file/folder name if it exists",
    "Use the command-line version of Primer3 software to design primer pairs.Install the Primer3 software:Method 1 (manual install) i. Navigate to the Primer3 GitHub page (https://github.com/primer3-org/primer3[href=https://github.com/primer3-org/primer3]).ii. Under \"Code,\" select \"Download ZIP.\"iii. Extract the folder to the local drive, not a cloud drive.iv. Navigate to the extracted folder in the command line and run the following commands:make make test Method 2 (MacOS command-line install) i. Open Terminal.ii. Install XCode command line tools (if not already installed) by entering the following command:xcode-select –install iii. Enter the following commands line by line into Terminal:git clone https://github.com/primer3-org/primer3.git primer3 cd primer3/src make make test iv. Primer3 is now installed.Method 3 (Linux command-line install) i. Follow Method 2, but instead of xcode-select --install, run the following command:sudo apt-get install -y build-essential g++ cmake git-all ii. Proceed with the rest of the steps from Method 3.Navigate to the primer3 folder and create an \"input.txt\" file and \"settings.txt\" file by entering the following commands into Terminal:touch input.txt touch settings.txt Run ./primer3_core ../example to ensure the program runs correctly.Edit the settings.txt file by following the format listed under \"20. Primer3 settings file format\" on the Primer3 website and with the settings values listed in SupplementalTable 2.Edit the input.txt file described under \"13. Input and output conventions\" on the Primer3 website. This will serve as the template sequence for which Primer3 will pick primers (Table 3).Table 3.

In the above case, the program will be required to design primers that surround the four base pairs around sequence number 54 (highlighted in yellow).",
    "Go to the NCBI website and choose the gene of interest, taking note of the exon junction locations and coding sequence locations. For additional detail, see Section E. Primer Design (Srinivasaraghavan et al., 2022).Copy and paste the sequence into the \"SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE\" section of the input.txt file and choose a target location.Note: The sequence must be formatted in a continuous string without newline characters. To remove newline characters from the sequence:  i. Download the FASTA file.ii Navigate to the file in the terminal and run the following command, where sequence.txt is the FASTA file:tr -d ‘\\n’ < sequence.txt In the terminal or command line interface, navigate to the primer3 folder (if not already in there) and run the following command:./src/primer3_core --p3_settings_file settings.txt input.txt --output output.txt i. This runs \"primer3_core\" in the /src/ folder, using the input file \"input.txt,\" the settings file \"settings.txt,\" and output file in the /output/ folder called \"output.txt\".Note: More arguments are described in the section \"Command line arguments\" on the Primer3 website. The input file does not need a flag. ii. Resulting primer results are printed onto the output.txt file that is designated above.Run quality control on primer results to find optimal primer pairs as stated in the original protocol (Srinivasaraghavan et al., 2022):Beacon designerChecks for primer dimers and self-dimers. Ensure ΔG values are >-3.5 (more positive).In-silico PCRChecks if primers amplify the correct regions in the genome.IDT UNAfoldChecks if the amplified product produces any secondary structures, such as stem loops. Ensure ΔG >3.5.Order primers at 40 nmol without purifying.Reconstitute primers in nuclease-free water to 100 μM.Make separate working concentrations of mixed forward/reverse primers at 1.5 μM for 384-well plating.For each gene, combine the forward and reverse primers and nuclease-free water (Table 4).

AutomatedWhile primers can be plated in any position and order, we find it most efficient and straightforward to plate them in an order consistent across all samples (Figure 2). It also helps in reducing pipetting errors.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4689/bioprotoc-13-11-4689-g002.jpgFigure 2. Example plate template for SYBR Green. Each filled colored circle is a unique gene; colored squares represent a different cDNA sample. Leave the bottom row for controls.Manual pipetting with PlatR pipetting aidThis system is ideal for small-scale pipetting with single-channel pipettes on 384-well plates. It consists of three components (Figure 3):i. Tablet and tablet stand.ii. Plate holder.iii. Foot pedal.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4689/bioprotoc-13-11-4689-g003.jpgFigure 3. PlatR pipetting aid setup to reduce manual pipetting errors in 96 and 384-well plates. Front (A) and side (B) setup of the PlatR pipetting aid. Plates are held in place by the adhesive-backed and removable plate holder (C). A foot pedal (D) is used to advance to the next well, which frees up hands. All these together increase ergonomics, pipetting consistency, and reduce user error.Place tablet on tablet stand.Open the app and create a new 384-well plate.Select the Reagents tab and create/assign primers to each well (Figure 4); then, select the Samples tab to assign cDNA/SYBR Green samples to each well (Figure 5) (How to set up your pipetting protocol | Pipetting Aid PlatR, 2021).Attach the plate holder to the tablet and place the plate in the holder.Connect the foot switch via Bluetooth and place it on the ground.Proceed with pipetting primers or master mix.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4689/bioprotoc-13-11-4689-g004.jpgFigure 4.
