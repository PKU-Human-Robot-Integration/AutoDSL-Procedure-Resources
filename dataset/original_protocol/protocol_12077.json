  "procedures": [
    "The steps below enumerate how to execute this novel cognitive paradigm designed to elucidate the neuro-behavioral aspects of external interference on delayed recognition working memory, with variations optimized for pairing with EEG or fMRI. Prior to beginning data collection, complete all necessary human-participants research approvals through the appropriate Institutional Review Board and/or human participants review committee.\n1. Preparation\nDownload and install experiment presentation software such as E-Prime, Presentation, or PsychoPy, as per manufacturer’s instructions, onto a dedicated stimulus presentation computer.\nPrepare an appropriate keypad for experimental responses. Add “YES” and “NO” labels to two adjacent keys (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: For versions of this experiment utilizing MRI, use an MR-compatible keypad.\nFor auditory versions of this paradigm, prepare headphones appropriate for testing modality (ie: EEG or MR-compatible, if necessary), as per manufacturer’s instructions, and adjust sound level for presentation at 65 decibels (dB) sound pressure level (SPL), which is a comfortable level for normal hearing individuals.\nFor experiments with older adults, conduct preliminary neuropsychological and sensory screenings such as vision and hearing to select an appropriately screened study population.\n\t\nNeuropscyhological screening\n\t\t\nCreate a neuropsychological assessment battery to screen for cognitive impairment in older adults. Administer tests by paper-and-pencil, or adapt a battery for testing on a computer.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Tests may include the Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE) 35 , Global Deterioration Score (GDS) 36, California Verbal Learning Test (CLVT) 37, Digit Span 38,39, Symbol Span 40, Letter-Number Sequencing 41, Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) – Trail Making Test 42, Controlled Word Association Test (COWAT) 43, 44.\nAdminister this battery to all prospective adult participants. Score all tests per their respective scoring guidelines.\nIf recruiting for healthy older adults, exclude prospective participants with scores greater than two standard deviations below the population mean, or per custom exclusion criterion.\nVision screening",
    "For visual experiments, screen for normal or corrected-to-normal vision using a preliminary questionnaire asking whether participants have normal or corrected-to-normal vision.\nTo follow up, conduct a Snellen chart vision test, and exclude participants without normal or corrected-to-normal (20/20 or greater) vision.\nFor auditory experiments, screen for normal hearing:\n\t\t\nIn a preliminary questionnaire, ask whether participants have normal or corrected-to-normal hearing, and exclude those who do not.\nTo follow up, obtain an objective measurement of hearing sensitivity. Conduct an in-lab audiometric assessment with one of several methods:\n\t\t\t\nUtilize a hearing loss screening test application such as ‘uHear’. Using this application’s auto-calculated results, exclude subjects with hearing sensitivity outside of the ‘normal hearing’ range.\nAssess audiometric thresholds in the 250 - 6,000 Hz frequency range in both ears by the method of ascending and descending limits. Individuals with mean audiometric thresholds greater than 50 dB at any test frequency in either ear, signifying moderate hearing loss, should be excluded\n2. Experimental Design\nAdminister a delayed recognition working memory task under three distinct interference conditions (and a fourth baseline condition for neural experiments) in a block design (see also Figure 2 and Table 1). Repeat each condition twice, in counterbalanced order (a balanced Latin square design is recommended). Note that experimental timing and number of trials vary between paradigm variants; utilize the parameters detailed in Table 1.\nIgnore Distracting Stimulus Condition (DS):\n\t\nDisplay a prompt instructing participant to remember the cue stimulus and ignore the distracting stimulus while continuing to maintain a representation of the cue stimulus. Instruct the participant to respond “YES” if the probe stimulus matches the cue stimulus or “NO” if the probe does not match the stimulus.\nPresent the cue stimulus, immediately followed by a short delay (Delay 1).",
    "Display an interfering ‘distractor’ stimulus, immediately followed by a second short delay (Delay 2).\n\t\tNOTE: The participant does not need to (and should not) interact with the distractor stimulus.\nPresent a probe stimulus and collect responses.\nAttend to Interrupting Stimulus (Secondary Task) Condition (IS):\n\t\nDisplay a prompt instructing participant to remember the cue stimulus and complete a secondary task using the interfering stimulus that appears thereafter. Display instructions to complete the secondary task as follows, “press a button only if the interrupting stimulus matches a set of discrimination criteria”. Instruct the participant to respond “YES” if the probe stimulus matches the cue stimulus or “NO” if the probe does not match the stimulus.\n\t\tNOTE: The discrimination criteria are distinct for each paradigm variant and described in the next section.\nPresent the cue stimulus, immediately followed by a short delay (Delay 1).) Present an interfering ‘interruptor’ stimulus and collect responses for the secondary (discrimination) task. Following, present a second short delay (Delay 2).\n\t\tNOTE: Completing the secondary task requires attention to the ‘interruptor’.\nPresent a probe stimulus and collect responses.\n\t\tNOTE: Ten percent of trials are catch trials in which the interruptor matches the discrimination criteria; add additional trials (10%) to this block to compensate for the discarded trials. Exclude all catch trials from neural analysis due to the confounding motor response.\nNo Interfering Stimulus Condition (NI):\n\t\nDisplay a prompt instructing the participant to remember the cue stimulus and keep it in mind. Instruct the participant to respond “YES” if the probe stimulus matches the cue stimulus or “NO” if the probe does not match the stimulus.\nPresent the cue stimulus, immediately followed by a delay. Display a central fixation cross on a blank screen during the delay.\nPresent a probe stimulus and collect responses.",
    "Baseline/Passive View (or Listen) Condition (only for neural experiments) (PV/PL)\n\t\nInclude a passive-view/listen condition during neuroimaging tasks to enable calculation of ‘enhancement’ and ‘suppression’ of neural activity during IS/DS conditions relative to baseline activity when participants passively view (/listen to) the working memory and interfering stimuli, free from task goals. (See Table 2.)\nDisplay a prompt instructing participant to passively view (/listen to) all visual (/auditory) task stimuli. Display instructions to complete the simple discrimination task.\n\t\t\nFor visual tasks, instruct the participant to press a button corresponding to the direction of a displayed arrow (left or right).\nFor auditory tasks, instruct the participant to press a button corresponding to the frequency range of an easily discriminable high (2 kHz) or low (0.5 kHz) frequency sound sweep (high or low).\nSequentially present or display the cue stimulus, Delay 1, interfering stimulus, and Delay 2.\nPresent an arrow (visual) or sound sweep (auditory) in place of the probe stimulus and collect responses as the participant completes the simple discrimination task (described above).\n3. Stimuli\n1. General Preparation of Stimuli\nSelect a set of stimuli from the categories described below (see also Figure 2 and Table 1).\nCarefully decide whether to pair primary working memory task stimuli with thematically congruent or incongruent interfering stimuli (see NOTE below).\nEnsure that all images are sized or re-sized to 225 pixels wide and 300 pixels tall (14 x 18 cm).\nPresent images foveally, subtending 3 degrees of visual angle from fixation.",
    "NOTE: For fMRI experiments, use interference stimuli incongruent with the primary working memory task stimuli, for example, face interference during scene working memory or vice versa. To precisely localize face and scene specific sensory cortical regions, apply a fMRI localizer task prior to the working memory experiment. Then, during the interference paradigm, use these scene and face selective cortical regions to simultaneously parse neural activity dynamics to the working memory cue stimuli (e.g., scenes) and to the incongruent interference stimuli. (e.g., faces)\n2. High-level Visual Stimuli\nFor face stimuli, prepare several hundred Cue/Probe Face stimuli from gray-scale photos of male and female faces, with neutral expression, across a large adult age range. Remove hair and ears digitally, and apply a blur across the contours of the face.\nFor scene stimuli, prepare several hundred Cue/Probe Scene stimuli from gray-scale photos of natural scenes.\nAfter Delay 1, present a interfering stimulus consisting of a scene or face. On 90% of trials, present a face that is not ‘male AND aged over 40 years old’; on the other 10% of trials, present a face that is male and aged over 40 years old.\nFor “Attend to Interruption” condition, instruct participants to complete the following secondary task using the interfering stimulus (presented between the cue and the probe). Ask the participant to respond “YES” if interrupting face is male and aged over 40 years old.\n3.  Low-level Visual Motion Stimuli\nCreate Cue/Probe stimuli of a circular aperture containing 290 spatially-random grey scale dots (0.08 degrees x 0.08 degrees each) that subtend 8 degrees of visual angle at a 75 cm viewing distance, centered at the fovea.\nDisplay moving dots with 100% motion coherence at an oblique angle of 10 degrees per sec, at one of 12 different directions of motion (3 in each sector).",
    "Use an adaptive staircase thresholding procedure (2 degree increments) to establish a visual discrimination value yielding just under 100% accuracy, such that the discrimination threshold is reached upon the first error trial.\nAfter Delay 1, present an interfering stimulus consisting of dots in counter-clockwise circular motion. Render this motion at a ‘normal’ speed (10 degrees per sec) on 90% of trials, and fast on the other 10% of trials.\nIn the Attend to Interruption condition, instruct participants to complete the following secondary task: respond “YES” if interrupting swirl is fast.\n4.  Low-level Auditory Motion Stimuli\nCreate Cue/Probe Stimuli of sound motion sweeps across a frequency range with mid-frequencies randomly chosen between 900 and 1,100 Hz. Construct the sound motion sweep frequencies to start at ± 0.5 octaves from the mid-frequency and end at ± 0.5 octaves from the mid-frequency.\nPresent an equal portion of ‘up’ (starting at -0.5 and ending at +0.5 octaves) and ‘down’ (starting at +0.5 and ending at -0.5 octaves) motion sweep stimuli.\nAdjust the volume to comfortable hearing level of 65 dB SPL.\nThresholding: use an adaptive Zest procedure to establish auditory discrimination accuracy at 85% correct performance.\nAfter Delay 1, present an interfering stimulus consisting of a single tone. Play a tone of frequency 2 kHz on 90% of trials, and a tone of 2.3 kHz on the other 10% of trials.\nIn the Attend to Interruption condition, instruct participants to complete the following secondary task: respond if interrupting tone is a higher frequency cue (2.3 kHz).\n5. Probe Stimuli\nFor all WM tasks, ensure that 50% of probe stimuli match the cue.",
    "In the low-level motion tasks with thresholded discrimination levels 5,10,11, set 50% of the probe stimuli, which do not match the cue, to differ from the cue by the absolute value of the participant’s thresholded stimulus discrimination level.\n\tNOTE: For instance, if thresholding establishes a participant’s visual discrimination level to be 10 degrees, pair a visual motion cue moving at 45 degrees with a probe moving at either 45 degrees (match on 50% trials) or 45 ± 10 degrees (35 or 55 degrees; each non-matches on 50% trials).\n4. Comparing Interference Conditions\nUse statistical software, such as SPSS, to compare behavioral performance and neural activity at important time-points before, during, and after different types of interference.\n\tNOTE: Several manuals online provide step-by-step instructions and screenshots describing how to use and run simple statistical analyses in SPSS.\n\t\nCalculate the impact of distractions versus interruptions on behavioral performance by contrasting working memory accuracies and response times during the interference conditions relative to the performance during the no interference condition (Figure 4). For instance, paired t-tests can be used to compare accuracy or RT between any two interference (or baseline) conditions.\n\t\tNOTE: Prior to t-test comparisons between two specific task conditions, a repeated measures ANOVA is recommended to compare across all working memory conditions in the paradigm .\nFor neuro-imaging studies, pre-process and process the data according to the appropriate pipline for the modality and measures of interest.\n\t\t\nFor EEG studies, process EEG data with EEGLAB or the software package of choice, using software’s instructions and recommended processing stream.\nFor fMRI studies, process fMRI data with the software package of choice (such as AFNI, SPM, FSL, etc.), using software’s instructions and recommended processing stream.",
    "To assess neural activity modulations as a consequence of interference during working memory, statistically contrast neural data in these conditions to neural activity during passive view(/listen) conditions, thus controlling for basic perceptual processing (Figure 4).\n\t\t\nCalculate the Measurements such that a positive value always indicates greater enhancement above baseline or greater suppression below baseline. For P100, calculate neural suppression by subtracting quantified neural activity to the distracting stimulus (DS) from that evoked by the passively viewed stimulus (PV) (i.e: PV - DS). Calculate enhancement in fMRI by subtracting quantified BOLD activity to the baseline passively viewed stimulus from that evoked by the interrupting stimulus (IS) (i.e: IS – PV).\nStatistically compare neural modulations elicited by ignored distractions versus activity during attended interruptions to begin to ascertain the specific impact of top-down attention on the resolution of different types of interference in working memory.\nSubscription Required.
