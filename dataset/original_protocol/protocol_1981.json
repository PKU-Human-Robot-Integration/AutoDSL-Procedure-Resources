    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPrepare samples\nTiming: 1 h\nDetermine the required concentration of the fluorescently labeled partner.\nTransfer a small amount of the sample to an MST capillary.\nRun a capillary scan in the MST instrument (Monolith NT.115).\nNote: The signal of the primary capillary scan should be between 200 and 2,000 fluorescence units to ensure a good signal-to-noise ratio without overloading the detector. If necessary, the fluorescence can be adjusted by changing the LED power setting on the MST instrument. Aim for as low concentration as possible that gives an appropriate fluorescence signal. Note that, in the final sample series, the fluorescent partner will be diluted by half, which needs to be considered. If needed, dilute the protein in MST-buffer.\nMake a dilution series of the purified AQP in MST-buffer in 12–16 200 μL microtubes (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). The final volume in each tube should be 5 μL.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1579-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Characterization of AQP protein-protein interactions using MST\n(A) Dilution series of AQP (blue) mixed with equal amount of fluorescently labeled partner protein (yellow) in small Eppendorf tubes. Mixed samples from the tubes were transferred to capillaries and analyzed by MST. During the experiment, a small part of the sample in each capillary is heated using an infrared laser and the movement of the molecules are followed by fluorescence.\n(B) A representative capillary scan showing the initial fluorescence in the capillaries before heating. Each peak corresponds to one capillary and are coloured according to the AQP4 concentration, with the highest and lowest concentrations in dark and light blue respectively. The fluorescence level should be the same in all capillaries, with an acceptable deviation of ±10%.",
    "(C) MST traces recorded from capillaries loaded with a dilution series of AQP4 mixed with same amount of labeled human calmodulin (CaM). The traces are coloured according to the AQP4 concentration as in (B). A non-well-formed MST trace is shown in red for illustrative purposes. The time points taken as F0 (before heating) and F1 (after heating) are shown as green and orange boxes respectively.\n(D) A binding curve generated from MST data, describing the human AQP4-CaM interaction (Kitchen et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). Curve fitting was done in Origin (OriginLab Corporation) using the full binding equation for a one-to-one model. Error bars represent the standard deviation from three individually prepared sample series.\nNote: We typically use a 1:1 dilution series to start with, but it may be advantageous to change to a different dilution ratio to get an optimal binding curve. The AQP starting concentration should be well above the expected dissociation constant (Kd). If the Kd is completely unknown, we suggest using 10 μM as a starting point.\nAdd 5 μL of the labeled interaction partner at the concentration determined in step 1.\nMix by pipetting up and down a few times.\nSpin down the samples for 30 s in a tabletop centrifuge.\nCritical: To minimize fluctuations in fluorescence between samples, add the labeled partner by pipetting gently and mix by pipetting up and down an equal number of times for each tube.\nRun the MST experiment\nTiming: 1 h\nLoad the samples into MST capillaries by inserting a capillary into the tube and tilting it 45°.\nCritical: Take care not to introduce any air bubbles as they will disturb the reading of the fluorescence.\nLoad the capillaries into the MST instrument and run a capillary scan to determine the initial fluorescence of the capillaries (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).",
    "Analyze the fluorescence peaks, making sure that they are uniform in shape and of equal height (see the MST instrument manual for details[href=https://www.uni-hohenheim.de/fileadmin/einrichtungen/mst/Manual_NT115.pdf]).\nCritical: The initial fluorescence as determined in the capillary scan must not differ more than ±10% between capillaries for the MST experiment to be reliable. A random fluctuation of the initial fluorescence is most likely due to pipetting errors whereas a ligand concentration-dependent trend may be caused by the binding event itself, in which case the initial fluorescence values can be used to determine the affinity instead of thermophoretic signal. Alternatively, the concentration-dependent difference can also be due to loss of the fluorescent molecule by sticking to the plastic tubes or capillary walls.\nCollect MST data and analyze the traces, making sure that they are smooth and do not contain any bumps (this suggests the presence of aggregates) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nNote: For an initial experiment we recommend collecting MST data at three different MST power settings (e.g., 20%, 40% and 60% MST power) in order to identify the setting that gives an appropriate signal to noise ratio. For collecting final data, we use the lowest MST power setting that gives acceptable MST signal amplitude in the binding curve (ΔFnorm ≥ 5).\nAnalyze the data using the MST instrument software (MO Affinity).\nNote: The program determines the normalized fluorescence (Fnorm) as the ratio between F0 (fluorescence before heating) and F1 (fluorescence after heating). If necessary, the time point used for F1 can be adjusted to give the best signal to noise ratio.\nOnce the appropriate settings and concentration range have been found, repeat steps 2–9 to generate triplicate data.\nCritical: Triplicate data should be obtained from three individually prepared dilution series."
