    "All the animal experiments described were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Kaohsiung Medical University.\n1. Animal Care\nTo avoid difficult cannulation due to small arterial size, use rats with body weight over 200 g.\nRemove chow from the cage and fast rats overnight.\nOffer water ad libidum unless there is a special experimental design.\n2. Experimental Preparation\nObtain the following materials: forceps with teeth (Figure 1A), surgical scissors (Figure 1B), forceps with fine tips (Figure 1C, 1D), forceps with angled tips (Figure 1E), bulldog vascular clamp (Figure 1F), silk string approximately 20 cm in length (Figure 1G), micro scissors (Figure 1H), intra-arterial cannula, a sterile polyethylene (PE) tube with an internal diameter of 0.5 mm and an outer diameter of 0.9 mm, 25–30 cm in length, connected to a 26 G x 1/2’’ needle (Figure 1I), two three-way stopcocks (Figure 1J) for connecting the intra-arterial cannula and the pressure transducer (Figure 1K), and 1 mL syringes filled with heparinized saline (100 IU/mL).\nAnimal Preparation\nAnesthetize the rat by inhalation of isoflurane (placing the rats in a 25 cm x 25 cm x 14 cm induction chamber saturated with 4% isoflurane, followed by nosecone use with 3% isoflurane).\nNOTE: If the animal is not sufficiently anesthetized, turn up the flow rate of isoflurane.\nTest the pain reflex by pinching the toes.\nPlace the rat in a supine position on a pre-cut Styrofoam board (or thick cardboard). Fix the four legs with rubber bands to immobilize the body (Figure 2A).\nNOTE: To avoid potential noise during the ECG recording, the placement surface must not be electrically conductive.",
    "Prepare instruments for BP and ECG recording. Include an analog input unit to acquire signals, a pressure transducer with a compatible hub, three bipolar needle-tipped electrocardiogram leads, and a computer with suitable software.\n3. Pressure Transducer Calibration\nBefore initiation of BP recording, calibrate with a standard mercury sphygmomanometer (Figure 1L).\nRemove the pressure cuff from the sphygmomanometer and connect the three-way stopcock on the inflation tube to the pressure transducer (Figure 1K) of the data acquisition system.\nScrew the air-release valve clockwise. Keep eyes on the gauge and keep pumping the inflation bulb. When the gauge shows 100 mmHg, switch the three-way stopcock to connect to the pressure transducer. Use 100 mmHg pressure for the calibration. The conversion factor for calculating BP will be determined automatically.\nRelease the pressure by screwing the air-release valve counterclockwise until the pressure of the sphygmomanometer is back to zero.\nRepeat step 3.2 with pressure of 200 mmHg.\nDetach the pressure transducer from the mercury sphygmomanometer.\nConnect the pressure transducer to the three-way stopcock of the PE catheter (Figure 1I).\n4. Mini-surgery for Cannulation of the Femoral Artery\nSurface landmark identification and excision of the skin (Figure 2)\nIdentify the location of inguinal crease (indentation at the junction between abdomen and thigh) (dashed line in Figure 2A).\nPinch the full layer of skin at the center of the inguinal crease. The fur may be shaved or removed from the incision site using electric clippers or a depilatory cream prior to incision.\nLift the skin and cut it off with the surgical scissors at an orientation approximately parallel to the ipsilateral thigh (Figure 2B). The femoral nerve and vessels are underneath the exposed subcutaneous tissue (Figure 2C).\nDissection of the tissue to expose the femoral artery",
    "Dissect the tissue using forceps with fine tips, layer by layer. Stop the dissection at the level of femoral vessels. Make sure the dissection is not injuring the vessels underneath.\nCarefully use forceps (Figure 1C or 1D) to clear out the soft tissue along the femoral nerve and vessels to obtain good observation. The nerve is fiber-like in texture. The vein is dark purple and the artery is pulsatile (Figure 3A).\nUse forceps with angled tips (Figure 1E) to extend the exposed length of the femoral artery and vein (Figure 3B).\nCannulation of the femoral artery (Figure 3)\nUse forceps to separate the femoral vein from the artery and apply a bulldog clamp at the femoral artery as cranially as possible (Figure 3C).\nMake a loose tie of the two silk strings, one just below the bulldog clamp and the other at the caudal terminal of the exposed femoral artery (Figure 3D).\nMake a small hole over the ventral side of the femoral artery (Figure 3E) using the micro scissors (Figure 1H).\nInsert the tip of the PE catheter through the small hole and advance the catheter cranially.\nNOTE: Do not apply torsion while advancing the PE catheter. The torsion force may twist the femoral artery and result in luminal stenosis.\nRemove the bulldog clamp after the PE catheter is securely advanced into the femoral artery lumen.\nNOTE: Keep eyes on the PE catheter while removing the bulldog clamp from the femoral artery. The observation of a backflush of blood into the PE catheter associated with observation for pulse confirms its placement in the arterial lumen.  \nTighten the upper silk string to secure the position of the PE catheter.\nNOTE: Any accidental pull or dislocation of the PE catheter can result in major bleeding.",
    "Tighten the lower silk string to prevent bleeding from the caudal side of the femoral artery.\nConfirmation of the success of femoral artery cannulation\nUse a 1 mL syringe to inject 0.1–0.2 mL of heparinized saline into the femoral artery. The resistance on injection must be trivial. If any obvious resistance upon injection is noticed, check the whole cannulation again.\nNOTE: Make sure the three-way stopcocks are appropriately switched before applying any negative pressure or saline injection into the femoral artery cannula. At this time point, any injection into the pressure transducer will need a re-calibration.\nCheck if there is any oozing around the cannulation site. If not, cover the surgical site with a wet cotton ball.\n5. Recording of Blood Pressure\nAfter a smooth flush for the PE catheter, attach the PE catheter three-way stopcock to the one on the pressure transducer (Figure 4).\nMake sure that there are no air bubbles in the cannulation system. Also check the connection junctions of the three-way stopcock.\nStart the data acquisition system with sampling frequency of 1,000 Hz to record the BP. Arterial pressure waves will be demonstrated (Figure 6).\nAllow the whole setup to stabilize for at least 3-5 min. In cases with unsteady signals, stabilization time can be extended to 15 min.\nCheck the cannulation site periodically to make sure there is no bleeding.\n\tNOTE: When acquiring data from a pressure transducer, it is important to place the transducer at the level of the animal’s heart.\n6. Surface ECG\nCheck the three leads of the bipolar ECG to make sure the positive, negative, and reference platinum electrodes are intact.\nInsert the leads subcutaneously at the left foreleg, right foreleg, and right hindleg (Figure 5).",
    "Attach the electrode hubs to a custom-built ECG amplifier with sampling frequency of 1,000 Hz and filter frequency of 3–500 Hz. Keep ECG leads steady during recording. Motion of the ECG leads can produce unsteady baselines and artifacts.\n7. Animal Euthanasia After Completing of the Experiment\nAfter completing of the BP and ECG recording, stop the acquisition system. Remove the electrodes. Ligate the femoral artery by tightening up the previously placed silk string right after withdrawing the PE catheter.\nPlace the rats individually in the visible euthanasia chamber connected to compressed carbon dioxide (CO2) gas cylinders. Seal the top securely.\nIntroduce 100% CO2 with a fill rate of about 10% to 30% of the chamber volume per minute.\nKeep your eyes on the rat; lack of respiration and faded eye color should appear within 2−3 min.\nNOTE: If cessation of respiratory movement does not occur after 3 min, the system should be examined for the chamber fill rate, CO2 supply, or leaks.\nMaintain CO2 flow to the chamber for 1 more minute after respiration ceases.\nAscertain cardiac and respiratory arrest and note fixed and dilated pupils to confirm death.\nNOTE: If the rat is not dead but in CO2 narcosis, use a secondary method of euthanasia such as bilateral thoracotomy.\nSubscription Required.
