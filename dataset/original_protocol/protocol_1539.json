    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nOocyte collection\nTiming: [2–3 h]\nCattle (Bos taurus) oocytes can be collected from multiple sources depending on the hypothesis or the biological questions addressed in a specific study. Potential sources of oocytes are in vivo aspiration of follicles using ultrasonography-guided ovum pick up (Bo et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) or ex vivo aspiration of follicles from ovaries obtained from an abattoir (Tribulo et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib34]). All oocytes used in this protocol were obtained from ex vivo aspiration of follicles from ovaries obtained from an abattoir. Ovaries were obtained postmortem, and no animal was handled or euthanized for this study. Thus, this work was carried out in compliance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Virginia Tech. We note that the user should follow the appropriate regulations when obtaining biological samples from vertebrates. Cumulus oocytes complexes (COCs) can be obtained from multiple sources.\nNote: This protocol starts with the COCs (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) after their isolation and selection for further work. In a cumulus-oocyte complex, the oocyte will be identified as a large cell, often >100 μm in diameter, enclosed in a thick layer of glycoproteins, the zona pellucida (Gupta, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]; Hyttel et al., 1986[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]; Wassarman and Litscher, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib36]). The cumulus cells are the small cells surrounding the zona pellucida (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nNote: The procedures described for the handling of COCs and oocytes are carried out with the aid of a stereoscope.\nStripping of cumulus cells from oocytes.\nAdd three drops (50 μL) of Denuding solution on a 35mm dish and cover with oil.\nAdd three drops (50 μL) of Oocyte wash solution on a 35mm dish and cover with oil.\nTransfer the oocytes into one of the drops with Denuding solution and pipette (20 or 100 μL pipettor) to remove the cumulus cells.",
    "Using a stripper pipette (175 μm tip) aspirate the oocytes to the next drop of Denuding solution. Repeat the removal of the cumulus cells with the (20 or 100 μL pipettor) or the stripper pipette.\nRepeat the washing once again using the third drop of denuding solution. Aspirate as minimal volume as possible.\nUsing a stripper pipette (175 μm tip) aspirate the oocytes to the drop containing the Oocyte washing solution. Aspirate as minimal volume as possible.\nTransfer the oocytes to the next drop containing the Oocyte washing solution and repeat the procedure until no cumulus cells are visible under the stereoscope.\nUsing a stripper pipette (175 μm tip) aspirate one oocyte with minimal volume of washing solution and transfer into a 0.2 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nImmerse the tube immediately into liquid nitrogen (snap freezing). Preserve the material at -80°C until used for RNA extraction.\nAlternatively, if liquid nitrogen is not available, transfer the oocytes to tubes containing 5 μL of an RNA stabilization solution (Camacho-Sanchez et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). Preserve the material at -80°C until used for RNA extraction.\nPause point: Cells can be maintained at -80°C for long-term storage\nTotal RNA extraction from single oocytes\nTiming: [2–3 h]\nThis step involves the extraction of total RNA from single oocytes using Trizol reagent. The procedures described here have been adapted from the manufacturer’s protocol to minimize the loss of total RNA obtained from single oocytes and embryos. A schematic of the procedure with pictures of critical steps is depicted in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1108-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic of the total RNA extraction from single oocytes\nNote: Pre-spin the Phasemaker Tubes for 30 sec at 12,000 × g.\nNote: In our laboratory we work with up to 12 tubes containing single oocytes in a single batch.",
    "Critical: It is particularly important that the tubes containing the oocyte lysates do not thaw before the addition of the Trizol reagent to the tube.\nTransfer the 0.2 mL microcentrifuge tubes containing the single oocytes to a precooled PCR rack.\nBefore the solution containing the cell lysate thaws, add 150 μL of a monophasic solution of Trizol (Chomczynski and Sacchi, 1987[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9], 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Rio et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib31]) to the 0.2 mL microcentrifuge tube. Add Trizol reagent to all tubes you are working with, then proceed to the next step.\nRemove the tube from the cold rack onto a rack at ∼24°C.\nAssuming that a minimum volume (∼ 1 μL) was added to the tube with the oocyte, add 10 μL of water to the solution, and mix the solution gently by pipetting up and down (∼5–10 times). Add water to all tubes you are working with, then proceed to the next step.\nTransfer the homogenate solution to into a 2 mL centrifuge tube containing a gel polymer capable of separating the aqueous phase from the organic phase (Murphy and Hellwig, 1996[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]).\nLet the solution stand at ∼24°C for 5 min.\nAdd 30 μL of chloroform to the solution and mix the solution vigorously by shaking the tube for 15 s.\nLet the solution stand for 3 min at ∼24°C.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAdd 20 μL of chloroform to the solution and mix the solution vigorously by shaking the tube for 15 s,\nCentrifuge at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nIn the meantime add 1μL (15 μg) of glycoblue to a new 0.2 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nRemove all aqueous solution from the phase maker tube and place it in the 0.2 mL microcentrifuge tube containing the glycoblue.",
    "Mix the aqueous solution with the glycoblue by pipetting very gently (5 times).\nNote: Do not to touch the gel with the pipette tip. If the gel is touched, dispense the aqueous solution onto the gel gently and use a new pipette tip.\nNote: This step can also be executed by transferring the aqueous solution to all tubes, followed by mixing of the solution with glycoblue, which can be done with a multi-channel pipette.\nAdd 100 μL of isopropanol to the solution and mix by gentle pipetting (5 times).\nNote: This step can also be executed by adding isopropanol to all tubes, followed by mixing of the solution with a multi-channel pipette.\nLet the tube stand at ∼24°C for 10 min.\nNote: Extended precipitation may be used to increase the yield of total RNA. In this case store samples for 12–18h at -20°C and resume the protocol to pellet the RNA.\nCentrifuge at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nNote: If the centrifuge rotor accommodates only 2 mL tubes. Add the 0.2 mL tubes into a 0.5 mL tube, which can be placed in an adaptor or add the 0.5 mL tube into a 2mL tube. Cut the lids of the 0.5 and 2 mL tubes to facilitate the handling.\nRemove the supernatant gently and discard. Do not disrupt the pellet.\nNote: It is easier to remove most of the liquid with a 200 μL pipette and remove the remainder with a 10 μL or 20 μL pipette, which allows a more precise removal of the liquid without touching the pellet.",
    "Note: If RNALater or equivalent high salt RNA stabilization solution was used there will a formation of a bubble-like blue precipitate (Camacho-Sanchez et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). Remove the isopropanol without disrupting this bubble. Add 150 μL of isopropanol 50% to the microcentrifuge tube, and repeat steps 21 and 22.\nAdd 150 μL of Ethanol 75% to the 0.2 mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 15,000 × g for 2 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant gently and discard. Do not disrupt the pellet.\nAdd 150 μL of Ethanol 75% to the 0.2 mL tube.\nPause point: The pelleted RNA can be stored long term in Ethanol 75% at -80°C without cause RNA degradation.\nCritical: Only continue the protocol if the reverse transcription and PCR amplification will be executed without interruption or storage of nucleic acids synthesized.\nNote: If the material was stored resume the protocol on step 27.\nCentrifuge at 15,000 × g for 2 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant gently and discard. Do not disrupt the pellet.\nNote: It is easier to remove most of the liquid with a 200 μL pipette and remove the remainder with a 10 μL or 20 μL pipette, which allows a more precise removal of the liquid. Remove ethanol 75% as much as possible without touching the pellet.\nCritical: Have the RNA elution mix ready before starting air drying the pellet.\nAir-dry the pellet, which takes about one minute if all the liquid is removed. Proceed immediately to the desired assay using the RNA.\nCritical: Proceed immediately to the reverse transcription using the RNA.\nCritical: Avoid extensive air drying because it will make the elution of the pellet very difficult. The pipetting required for the dissolution of a dry pellet will increase the breaking of the RNA strands.",
    "Note: Since the RNA used for sequencing is limited in quantity, assessment of quality prior to reverse transcription is not possible. Alternatively, assess the RNA quality of some samples that are collected and processed exclusively for quality control. Add 1 μL of water directly to the RNA pellet and wait for the pellet to dissolve in approximately 5–10 min. on ice. Proceed with the automated capillary electrophoresis.\nReverse transcription\nTiming: [2 h]\nThis protocol for synthesis of complementary DNA was adapted from the molecular crowding single-cell RNA barcoding sequencing (mcSCRB-seq) (Bagnoli et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) and the Smart-Seq2 (Picelli et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28], 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib29]). The procedure described here rely on manual liquid handling and transfer, however the protocol can be adapted for robotic liquid handlers (Jaeger et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]).\nCritical: Spin down all microtubes after thawing reagents (in the case of enzymes, spin down the tubes in a refrigerated centrifuge immediately before pipetting the necessary volume), before and after incubations.\nCritical: Use sterile and nuclease-free pipette tips containing a filter barrier. Always change pipette tips to avoid cross contamination.\nNote: Have all the programs set up on the thermocycler prior to starting the protocol.\nAdd 5 μL the RNA elution mix directly onto the pellet and allow the total RNA pellet to dissolve in this solution. Maintain the tubes on ice.\nNote: This step usually takes approximately 5 min. Do not speed up the elution by pipetting. Only proceed once the pellet disappears.\nUsing a thermocycler, incubate the solution at 72°C for 3 min.\nImmediately after the conclusion of the previous step, immerse the tubes on ice. Keep the tubes on ice for 3–5 min.\nWhile the tubes are on ice, prepare the Reverse transcription mix, keep tubes on ice.",
    "Add 5 μL of Reverse transcription mix to the solution containing RNA, mix gently by pipetting (∼5 times).\nUsing a thermocycler, incubate the solution at 42°C for 90 min.\nNote: Due to the presence of PEG 8000, the Reverse transcription mix is viscous. Start preparation of the reverse transcription mix by adding the buffer to help the dispensing of the PEG 8000. Mix this solution very gently. On step 34 mix the solution very gently.\nCleanup of the DNA:RNA hybrids\nTiming: [1 h]\nNote: Remove the magnetic beads from the refrigerator 30 minutes prior to using it. At the time of use, vortex the magnetic beads to mix the solution well. In our laboratory we prepare aliquots of the beads solution to prevent contamination of the bottle.\nNote: All procedures for DNA:RNA clean-up are carried out at ∼24°C. Magnetic beads are magnetic nano spheres coated with a biopolymer exhibiting high affinity to nucleic acids (see review by (Berensmeier, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]))\nAdd 10 μL of magnetic beads solution to each tube. After the addition of magnetic beads to all tubes, mix the solution with gentle pipetting (∼ 10 times). Let the tubes stand for 5 min.\nTransfer the tubes with magnetic beads to a magnetic rack. Let the tubes stand for 8 min.\nRemove the solution gently without disrupting the beads and discard the solution. Use a 100 μL pipette set at > 20 μL to remove the ∼ 20 μL of volume.\nWith the tubes still on the magnetic rack, gently add 200 μL of ethanol 80% to avoid disrupting the magnetic beads.\nWait for 30 s\nRemove the solution carefully to avoid disrupting the magnetic beads\nGently add 200 μL of ethanol 80% to avoid disrupting the magnetic beads.\nWait for 30 s",
    "Remove the solution carefully to avoid disrupting the magnetic beads\nRemove the tubes from the rack and let the tubes standing on a regular rack or the beads to dry.\nNote: Usually, it takes ∼5 min for “cracks” to form on the beads, which indicates their dryness.\nAdd 9.5 μL of water to each tube, making sure that the water is deposited on the magnetic beads that are on the wall of the microcentrifuge tube.\nWait for ∼2 min for the magnetic beads to begin absorbing water.\nMix the solution gently with a 10 μL pipette (∼ 5 times).\nLet the tubes stand for 2 min.\nTransfer the tubes to the magnetic rack.\nLet the tubes stand for 5 min.\nVery gently, aspirate 9 μL of the solution containing the DNA:RNA hybrids into a new 0.2 mL tube.\nNote: Avoid aspirating beads. If beads are seen in the pipette tip, dispense the liquid gently, wait for 2 min and repeat the process.\nFull-length transcript polymerase chain reaction\nTiming: [2 h]\nPrepare a PCR reaction mix. Add 11 μL to each tube and mix by gentle pipetting (∼5 times).\nCarry out the amplification using the following cycles.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1108_5.csv\nNote: Ideally, the number of cycles should be determined by assaying the RNA from few oocytes at different cycle numbers to avoid over-amplification, which can be observed by the presence of peaks when assaying the amplified complementary DNA on the automated capillary electrophoresis.\nRemove the tubes from the thermocycler and proceed with the clean-up.\nAmplified DNA cleanup\nTiming: [1 h]\nNote: Remove the magnetic beads from the refrigerator 30 minutes prior to using it. At the time of use, vortex the magnetic beads to mix the solution well.\nNote: All procedures for DNA clean-up are carried out at ∼24°C",

    "Pause point: DNA can be stored at -80°C for at least six months.\nAssess the yield of the amplified complementary DNA using fluorometry instrument and assess the DNA profile using capillary automated electrophoresis.\nPreparation of DNA library for high-throughput sequencing\nTiming: [1 h]\nThese steps will describe the production of DNA library for next generation sequencing based on bead-linked transposome technology (Bruinsma et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Caruccio, 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) to produce fragments of DNA within a narrow range around 450 base pairs long.\nAssess the yield of the amplified complementary DNA using fluorometry instrument (e.g., Qubit) and assess the DNA profile using capillary automated electrophoresis (e.g., Bioanalyzer).\nPrepare a diluted sample of amplified cDNA at 1 ng in 30 μL of water.\nFollow the protocol described in the Nextera DNA flex Library preparation kit reference guide until the elution of the cleaned library.\nNote: Libraries are barcoded in one the specific steps of library construction. In this kit, during the PCR amplification. In our laboratory we use the dual barcode scheme.\nNote: Do not carry out the normalization steps for analysis of gene expression.\nNote: Carry out 12 cycles of PCR.\nAssess the yield of the amplified complementary DNA using fluorometry instrument (e.g., Qubit) and assess the DNA profile using capillary automated electrophoresis (e.g., Bioanalyzer). The automated electrophoresis will also be important for the estimation of average fragment length of the library\nAlternatives: The data presented in this protocol was prepared with the Nextera DNA flex Library preparation kit, however alternatives to this protocol exist. Since the production of the representative data, Illumina Inc. has released another kit for library production based on the transposon technology. It is also possible to quantify the library DNA using quantitative PCR reagents and the appropriate analytical procedures (Hawkins and Guest, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]).",
    "Pooling of libraries for high-throughput sequencing\nCalculate the molarity of each library in nanomolar using the standard equation:     (  c o n c e n t r a t i o n   ( n g / μ l )  )    (  660  g  m o l    ×  a v e r a g e  l i b r a r y  f r a g m e n t  l e n g t h   ( b p )  )     ×  10 6   \nCombine samples maintaining equimolar quantities of material from each library.\nSubmit samples for sequencing according to the sequencing facility’s guidelines.\nBasic bioinformatic procedures\nThe processing of the RNA-sequencing data often follows a basic flow of alignment of the reads to the reference genome and counting of the reads according to gene annotation, but there are many variations of this workflow (Conesa et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Van den Berge et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). To produce the representative results, sequences were aligned with Hisat2 (Kim et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20], 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]; Pertea et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]), followed by filtering with samtools (Li et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]) (remove unmapped reads, secondary alignments, failing of platform quality checks, PCR or optical duplicate) and removal of duplicates with the function ‘bammarkduplicates’ from biobambam (Tischler and Leonard, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib33]). Sorting and indexing were done with Picard (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/[href=http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/]).
