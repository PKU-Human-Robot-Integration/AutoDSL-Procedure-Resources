    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSynchronize populations and place on designated conditional plates\nTiming: 10–30 min\nThese steps include collection of eggs by bleaching of 400–800 gravid worms from each strain, and then placing 150–200 eggs on each designated conditional plate (with/without drugs) to generate synchronized populations. This is a crucial step for memory assays, and minimizes age-dependent variability.\nCollect ad libitum-fed animals of mixed population (with 400–800 gravid worms) from the large-size worm maintenance NGM plate(s) using 1.5 mL M9 buffer.\nTransfer them to a 1.5 mL tube (pre-labeled with group name).\nRemove the supernatant after the majority of adult worms have sunk to the bottom of the tube due to gravity (normally within a minute).\nWash the worms 1–2 times using M9 buffer to clean remaining bacteria out and discard the supernatant.\nNote: For step3, we suggest avoiding ‘spinning down’ as this will force any OP50 and small larvae down into the worm ‘pellet’ in the bottom of the tube.\nUse the bleaching solution to collect eggs for the purpose of generating synchronized nematode populations.\nAdd 1 mL of bleaching solution. Vortex the 1.5 mL tube for 30 s to 1 min (to break the worm’s hard cuticle), and manually shake the tube in a gentle way.\nPellet the eggs by centrifuging at 1,000 × g for 30 s in 20°C, and carefully remove the supernatant using a pipette.\nWash the egg pellet with 1 mL M9 buffer and centrifuge the pellet at 1,000 × g for 30 s in 20°C.\nRepeat step 5c three times to completely wash away the bleaching solution.",
    "Critical: Bleaching is a way to obtain a highly synchronized population of worms for the following experiments. The principle of this method relies on the biology of the adult worm which makes its body sensitive to the bleaching buffer while the embryos are ‘relatively’ protected by their hard eggshell during short periods of exposure. However, long-term exposure to the bleaching solution will reduce the hatching ratio of eggs as well as causing developmental and health issues in hatched worms.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] Thus, it is suggested to limit the exposure of the eggs to the bleaching solution to less than 5 min. Additionally, repetitive bleaching of worm cohorts kept for colony maintenance and propagation must be avoided.\nNote: Manually shake the tube to further dissolve the worms’ cuticle, maximizing the numbers of eggs released from the dissolving body.\nRe-suspend the eggs in 500 μL M9 buffer.\nPipette 20 μL of egg-containing M9 buffer (150–200 eggs) and spread the solution in a prepared medium plate (with OP50 lawn, with/without test drugs).\nWait for 5 min to enable M9 solution to be adsorbed by the NGM.\nSeal the plates with paraffin to maintain humidity and reduce chances of contamination.\nPlace them upside down in a 20°C incubator for 3 days until the animals reach the 1-day of adulthood.\nCritical: Worms should never be starved. A good control of the total number of animals/plate is essential to avoid starvation; we suggest keeping 150–200 worms on a medium-size maintenance plate. Early starvation will halt the development of the worms, and late starvation will induce unexpected changes that will then cause experimental failure. Additionally, overcrowded and/or contaminated cultures should not be assayed.",
    "Note: In step 6, adjust the volume to achieve a concentration of 75–100 eggs / 10 μL. For step 7, to attain enough adult worms for the experiments, we suggest the preparation of four plates/group. For step 10, the day after L4 is considered adult Day 1, not adult Day 0 as used in some laboratories. For worm strains with slower/faster development speed, days of incubation to reach adult Day 1 should be individually observed.\nCollection of synchronized population to perform conditioning assay using isoamyl alcohol (IA)\nTiming: 100–120 min\nThese steps show how to collect and transfer synchronized populations of worms from each treated group to conditioning plates. For each group, worms are equally divided into two plates (no food) for 90-min conditioning (naïve and IA).\nWash the ad libitum-fed adult Day 1 (or worms of other age) animals off an NGM plate using 1.5 mL M9 buffer.\nTransfer the worms to a 1.5 mL tube using a 1 mL pipette tip.\nAfter the worms have settled to the bottom via gravity, gently wash the pellet of worms with M9 buffer three more times.\nCritical: For step 13, a significant portion of nematodes may stick to the inner wall of plastic 1 mL pipette tips during transfer. Glass pipettes are an alternative that will reduce loss of worms during transfer steps. Repeat the washing step three times to remove/decrease the bacterial population. Do not spin the tube down, but just let the worms settle down by gravity. To avoid overstressing the nematodes, the total washing time should be limited to 5 min.\nDiscard most of the M9 buffer and keep 200–300 μL of buffer with worms for the next step.",
    "Transfer worms to a conditioning plate using a pipette and dry off excess buffer using a small piece of Kimtech™ delicate task wipe under a microscope.\nFor naïve plates (no OP50), seal plates with parafilm, and place the plates upside down (for uniformity in the next step) before step 15b.\nFor IA plates (no OP50), place a drop of pure IA (10 μL) on the internal surface of the IA plate’s lid and spread it around evenly. Seal plates with parafilm immediately and place the plates upside down.\nIncubate all plates at 20°C–22°C for 90 min.\nCritical: As worms are very sensitive to temperature shifts and smells, which could lead to changes in olfactory sensitivity and behavioral scores, it is important to keep a stable temperature and a clean environment during all experimental stages. It is necessary to avoid direct exposure of the conditioning plates to sunlight or airflow from an air-conditioner; other than the IA smell, the experimental environment should have no other noticeable smells, such as the smells of shampoo, perfume, or any other pungent chemicals. To enable even and quick IA dispersal within the conditioning plate, it may help to release the 10 μL IA slowly in a spiral pattern rather than releasing it as a single drop.\nPrepare chemotaxis experimental plates\nTiming: 10–30 min\nThese steps detail preparation of chemotaxis experimental plates including marking of plates with ‘gradient’ (IA), ‘trap’ (T), and ‘start’ (S) points, labeling of the designated information (strain name, drug information, naïve/IA condition), and adding of sodium azide (20 mM, 15 μL) at both point ‘IA’ and point ‘T’ at 15 min before next step.\nMark chemotaxis assay plates to define the points for IA, T, and S.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2647-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "A chemotaxis assay plate (large-size petri dish with NGM, 8.5 cm internal diameter, no OP50) with the three designated ‘dots’. Left is a schematic model while the right two plates are demonstrations of an experiment. ‘IA’, isoamyl alcohol; ‘T’, trap; ‘S’, start point (location where all the worms being tested are loaded).\nNote: To do this, draw an isosceles triangle with two upper corners (to be labeled ‘IA’ and ‘T’) equidistant (4.5 cm) from the start corner, while the distance between ‘IA’ and ‘T’ should be 6.5 cm (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nMark the designated name on each assay plate (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\n15 min before step 19, add sodium azide (20 mM, 15 μL) at both point ‘IA’ and point ‘T’.\nChemotaxis assay\nTiming: 150–180 min\nThese steps show how to collect and place the worms on the assaying plates after the conditioning period. Worms are then allowed to explore the area and the number of worms in each zone is counted after 2 h.\nCollect worms into 1.5 mL tubes from each conditioning plate via washing each plate with 1.5 mL M9 buffer.\nCritical: A glass pipette is recommended for transferring of the worms since the animals may stick to the inside of plastic pipette tips. Make sure to use a new pipette/pipette tip for each group to avoid cross-contamination. To avoid unexpected stress and harm, the total washing time should be limited to 5 min. To save time and avoid mistakes (such as mixing the different groups), it is recommended that you pre-label the 1.5 mL tubes and plates carefully up to one day ahead of time.\nTransfer the worms with an individual pipette from the 1.5 mL tubes to point ‘S’ on the matched assay plates.\nDry the excess buffer using a small piece of Kimtech™ delicate task wipe.",
    "Place a square piece of parafilm (size of 0.5 × 0.5 cm) at the ‘IA’ spot on the agar (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nAdd 4 μL of diluted IA (ratio 1:50 in water) on top of the parafilm.\nImmediately seal the plates using parafilm and keep the plates at 20°C–22°C for 2 h.\nAfter 2 h, count the number of worms at each point under a microscope and record the numbers accordingly.\nCritical: For step 22, it is important to add the diluted IA on the parafilm as it will be quickly absorbed by the NGM agar if plated directly on the ‘IA’ spot. One may wonder why a similar square of parafilm is not placed to the ‘T’ spot. This is because we aim to ‘trap’ the worms with poor memory by sticking them to the ‘T’ spot once they arrive there. The addition of the parafilm square would prevent this from happening, and therefore we avoid this step. For step 24, in any labs with a big temperature shifts during the experimental period (normally 4–6 h), it is suggested that the experiments be performed inside a temperature-controlled incubator set to between 20°C - 22°C. For step 25, it is not uncommon for a small portion of worms to remain at ‘S’ even at the end of the experiment. In our experience, most of them are injured worms, likely due to physical damage during the experimental procedures; if this is the case, these ‘injured’ worms can be excluded for statistics. If the number of injured worms reaches to over 20% of the total worms in a group, and/or this is happening in many groups, it is recommended to repeat the experiment.\nData analysis and figure preparation\nTiming: 10–60 min\nThese steps describe calculation of the chemotaxis index using a simple equation.",
    "Calculate chemotaxis index according to the equation = (IA - T)/ (IA + T + S).\nAnalyze and graph the chemotaxis index data utilizing software such as GraphPad Prism.\nCritical: For data validation and statistics, at least three biological replicates are needed."
