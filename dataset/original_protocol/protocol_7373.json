    "Brain collection (fresh frozen) and storage  In RNase-free conditions (achieved by cleaning the area with RNase AWAY or any other decontaminant such as low concentration bleach), prepare a beaker containing 300 mL of 2-methylbutane, which will sit on dry ice pellets in a stereo foam container under a chemical hood. The temperature of the 2-methylbutane is monitored with an ultralow temperature thermometer. Allow 30–45 min for the 2-methylbutane to reach the temperature of -30 °C, which is optimal to protect the brains from cracking during cryostat slicing and the mRNA from degradation (see Note 1).Deeply anesthetize the rat with isoflurane (or any other anesthetic) and perform sacrifice by decapitation. Quickly remove the brain from the skull, removing bone and membrane residues that can potentially damage the tissue.Immediately drop the brain in chilled 2-methylbutane (-30 °C) and snap-freeze for 25 s (see Note 2).Grab snap-frozen brain with long tweezers and immediately wrap it in aluminum foil. Avoid any thawing of the tissue and immediately store brains on either dry ice or at -80 °C (see Note 3).Store brains at -80 °C for up to 12 months. It is not recommended to use brains stored for longer periods, as the mRNA degrades progressively. Notes: If researchers intend to fix the brains using formalin, a different protocol including transcardial perfusion must be followed. Brains perfused in formalin should be post-fixed with formalin overnight, transferred to 30% sucrose to cryoprotect the tissue, and snap-frozen in 2-methylbutane for long-term storage.   Cracks in the tissue will make slicing the samples unmanageable for subsequent assay. Freezing the brains in liquid nitrogen (ultralow temperature) will also create cracks, making the tissue unusable.   This time is critical to prevent splitting of the brain’s hemispheres and mRNA degradation.",
    "This procedure allows an even and quick freezing of brain tissue and preserves morphology and 100% of the targeted mRNA, especially if the target is low-to-moderately expressed.   Avoid any contact with tools that have not been previously decontaminated.   Preparation of fresh-frozen brain sections  Move brains from -80 °C to -20 °C prior to slicing. Depending on the laboratory conditions,  warming  the tissue will take a shorter or longer period of time (30 min to a few hours).Transfer brains from -20 °C to the cryostat’s chamber, whose temperature was previously optimized (-13 °C). Leave brains inside the cryostat for 2–3 h before starting the slicing. The optimal cryostat temperature for brain slicing depends on the device’s model (user manuals typically provide this information). The above equilibration time is sufficient to allow slicing without cracks. If brain is not ready, increase equilibration time. It usually takes longer when the brain is snap-frozen at temperatures lower than -40 or -50 °C.Decontaminate the external cryostat area in which SuperFrost®  Plus slides will be positioned before mounting. It is recommended to leave slides outside the cryostat to avoid them being too cold and prevent tissue adhesion after slicing (this step very much depends on the environment and cryostat).Add 2–3 drops of O.C.T. compound in the specimen stage and immediately place the frozen brain at the right orientation and angle to provide an accurate slicing. Make sure the tissue is perpendicular to the stage to avoid uneven sections.Cut 10 µm coronal slices from the desired region of interest [here, we collected sections containing the substantia nigra (SN)] and immediately mount them by adhesion onto the SuperFrost®  Plus slides. Each slide can contain up to three (depending on the orientation) rat brain sections.",
    "Overcrowding the glass slide with tissue sections will obstruct the area necessary to draw the hydrophobic barrier for the subsequent RNAscope assay.Keep the sections inside the cryostat to dry and store them in an air-tight slide box wrapped with aluminum foil at -80 °C.Use sectioned tissue within three months. Sectioned tissue is more prone to faster mRNA degradation. RNAscope assay  Multiplex assays are performed according to the manufacturer protocols (we outline specific details below). All incubations are performed at 40 °C using a humidity control chamber (HybEZ oven, Advanced Cell Diagnostics). The steps listed below are similar for mRNA target probes and negative controls, unless noted otherwise. It is recommended to run negative controls (one or two sections are sufficient) within each batch of tissue. Target probes were used as follows:RNAscope 3-plex negative control probe set (320871): bacterial DapB (in C1, C2, and C3 probe sets)RNAscope probe set: Rn-Hcrtr1-C1, Rn-Th-C2, and Rn-Fos-C3. Note that probe channels and fluorophores should be selected considering the expression levels of desired targets. For example, a higher expression gene may be chosen for a wavelength with high autofluorescence in your sample (e.g., 488/green).Below, we describe the most representative steps of this procedure. Slides are immersed in slide staining/washing set for each step, unless noted otherwise.Fix the sections: remove sections that were previously stored at -80 °C and immediately immerse them in pre-chilled fixative [4% paraformaldehyde (prepared by diluting a 32% stock solution of paraformaldehyde into 1× PBS) at 4 °C] for 40 min. This step must be performed in a fume hood given the toxicity of paraformaldehyde.Dehydrate the sections: place sections in 50% (1×), 70% (1×), and 100% (2×) ethanol for 5 min each at room temperature.Create a hydrophobic barrier around each brain section and let it dry for 1 min at room temperature.",
    "Prepare materials necessary to run the assay (wash buffer, target probes, reagents, and hybridization oven).Pretreat samples by applying protease IV (approximately five drops directly from the bottle; no dilution needed) for 30 min at room temperature inside the humidifying tray and close lid.Add desired probe to each section and incubate for 2 h at 40 °C inside the humidifying tray (this temperature is the same for all type of probes, including the negative controls). Importantly, apply the negative control probe to one section every time you run an assay.Hybridize probe(s) using Amp FL-1, -2, -3, and -4 (we used Amp FL-4-Alt A) for 15 or 30 min (see manufacturer’s instructions) at 40 °C. Each amplification step occurs inside the humidifying tray. After each amplification step, the Amp reagents are removed by washing the sections with wash buffer through slide solution wells.Counterstain using Fluoro-Gel II with DAPI and cover the sections with coverslips. Make sure the sections are almost completely dry before applying the mounting media to avoid creation of bubbles that can prevent target identification and thus quantification.Store slides in the dark at 4 °C until image evaluation (optimal time is up to one week). Note: It is possible to combine the RNAscope with IHC techniques, allowing the researcher to further clarify cell identity. In this particular combination, only formalin-fixed brain tissue can be used, and IHC will be done as a second step. Advanced Cell Diagnostics provides technical notes for this purpose that can be found here: https://acdbio.com/system/files_force/gated/TN_323100_TechNote_Dual_ISH_IHC_manual_Multiplex_Fluorescent_V2_06222017.pdf.pdf?download=1[href=https://acdbio.com/system/files_force/gated/TN_323100_TechNote_Dual_ISH_IHC_manual_Multiplex_Fluorescent_V2_06222017.pdf.pdf?download=1]. For pure RNAscope applications that do not require further cellular characterization, it is recommended to use fresh frozen tissue isolations, as explained in this protocol.",
    "Advantages include: 1) less supplies needed, which is a cost-saving factor; 2) fewer steps needed to achieve the same result; 3) better tissue quality that potentially translates to high-quality mRNA targeting, which will simplify the quantification process. In formalin-fixed tissue, it is necessary to add a target retrieval step (performed at high temperatures), which can cause tissue damage and prevent a successful probe targeting. Disadvantages of using fresh frozen tissue isolations include an inability to combine IHC assays that require formalin-fixed tissues (see beginning of this note for more details).   Imaging  Turn on scanner and computer.Start ZEN v2.6 software.Load slides in tray and insert inside the scanner.Inspect the slide magazine for accuracy.Click on wizard to start scan setup.Select region of interest (ROI)—in this protocol, we analyzed the SN. When selecting ROI, do not include solely the desired section, but expand to include part of the adjacent areas as well.In brightfield view, inspect contiguous brain areas to make sure you are in the correct ROI.In the fluorescent view, select desired channels based on the RNAscope assay. We have DAPI (blue), GFP (green), Cy3 (red), and Cy5 (far red).For particle counts, exposure times were calculated to allow clear detection of small foci in all channels. These are optimal settings for our scanner (see Note 1):DAPI: 6–8 msEGFP: 1,400–1,800 msCy3: 600–800 msCy5: 1,000–1,400 msFocus each channel and set parameters for z-stacking.Z-stacking: RNAscope sections were originally at 10 µm thickness; however, sections lose a few micrometers from the original thickness post processing. We do not need to set up the z-stacking depth to 10 µm, as that depth is not accurate anymore. In order to achieve a valuable number of slices that contain high-resolution transcripts, we set the z-stacking as follows:Depth: 5.20 µmInterval between slices: 0.",
    "85 µmNumber of slices: 7Start scan—a few to several hours will be necessary to scan all the sections, depending on the selected ROI.Save files for subsequent analysis in QuPath (see Note 2). Notes: These are the steps we followed to image our sections using a Zeiss Axioscan Z.1 within the ZEN software environment. Any high-resolution fluorescent or confocal microscope capable of producing z-stack slices can be utilized to achieve similar results. For all analyses, images were captured via 20× objectives that readily enabled identification of discrete foci corresponding to individual transcripts, while retaining sufficient axial resolution to allow all elements of the tissue section to remain well focused. Although we used these specific parameters for capturing a small brain region such as the SN, the same settings can be used for larger regions, obtaining similar results. Limitations of imaging larger regions are related to longer scanning sessions and increased number of focal points to be selected.   It is recommended to not vary settings in a single batch of slides. This will assist in maintaining consistency through the automatic quantification, minimizing variability in the subcellular thresholds, and identifying potential loss of mRNA signal in sections that are older.   The ZEN software automatically saves the scanned images in the .czi format, which includes several types of information, thus creating large files that require specific data management. Most importantly for the next step, CZI files can be opened in QuPath without the need to merge or process the images with other software (especially if ROIs are selected). QuPath will create as many files as the number of scenes scanned in ZEN.",
    "If larger ROI is selected and if a unique focal point is missing, it might be necessary to merge the z-stack slices (with maximum projection) to reach the desired focus in each image tile.   RNAscope subcellular quantification using QuPath (user manual:  https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/stable/[href=https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/stable/])Open QuPath-0.3.2.Under the  Project  tab on the left of the screen, click  Create project  or  Open project  to retrieve previous projects (Figure 3).

    "Double-click outside of your region to have the outline turn white and the region locked.You can also use the minimum and maximum display scales to achieve best brightness of your data. It is best to have similar settings across all channels when analyzing images.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4580/bioprotoc-13-01-4580-g005.jpg Figure 5.

Screen capture of QuPath.  Parameters used for cellular detection are indicated.After analyzing for  Cell Detection  , you will need to zoom in and inspect the quality of the segmentation. Some cells may have been grouped together and only counted as one, and other cells may have been segmented to count as multiple cells (see  Figure 7). You can alter the median filter radius, sigma, and threshold and re-run the cell detection until best segmentation is achieved (see  Figure 8).Poor segmentation can indicate that you need to alter the parameters of your run, or that you need to achieve better clarity of your ROI.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4580/bioprotoc-13-01-4580-g007.jpg Figure 7.

Alter parameters of maximum spot size and threshold to increase quality (see  Figure 9).You can return to  View  and  Brightness/Contrast  and double-click on a channel to change its color, as sometimes the subcellular components and the circle identifying them after analysis are the same color.Once best quality of data is collected, go to  Measure  and  Show Detection Measurements  (see  Figure 10). Choose  Copy to Clipboard  and open Excel to paste all the data.The only other piece of data to collect from inside QuPath is the number of cells. You can access this by clicking  Annotations  on the left side of the screen; at the top-left you will see  Annotation (Ellipse) (e.g., 1006/3650 objects)  . The first of the two numbers is the number of cells identified in QuPath. You can double-check this by viewing how many nuclei area you have in the Excel dataimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4580/bioprotoc-13-01-4580-g010.jpg Figure 10.

    "In Excel (Figure 11), the only columns you need to keep for data collection are:Nucleus:  Area  Subcellular channel 2:  Number of single spots  Subcellular channel 3:  Number of single spots  Subcellular channel 4:  Number of single spots  Find average nucleus area by selecting the letter of the column in which the nuclei area is listed; under  Sort and Filter  select  Sort Smallest to Largest  . Insert the average function in an empty cell, select all the cells containing nucleus areas, and then click enter.Again, sort smallest to largest on the subcellular channel 2 column and count the number of single spots above your set threshold, including the threshold (i.e., if my threshold is 5, count all the subcellular single spots showing 5 or more spots).Repeat for subcellular channels 3 and 4.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4580/bioprotoc-13-01-4580-g011.jpg Figure 11. Screen capture of Excel.  Subcellular detections are sorted for channel 2, and those cells above the threshold are highlighted in yellow.Once all the above parameters have been optimized, it is possible to expedite the analysis workflow using customized automatisms (see  Figure 12). We can create scripts deriving from the steps shown above or create customized scripts, if additional parameters or extensions will be used (e.g., Stardist—deep learning models). For simplicity, we describe the steps to generate an automatism from an existing workflow.Go to  Automate -> Show Workflow Command History -> Select desired steps -> Create script -> Save script.  Open generated script and inspect all the lines for accuracy. Modify channel and analysis parameters according to optimized workflow. Save script and run it for any other selected ROI.Automated analysis saves minutes of work allowing to complete tasks in fractions of time.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4580/bioprotoc-13-01-4580-g012.jpg Figure 12.
