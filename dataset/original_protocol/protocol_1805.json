Thaw the yeast cell powder on ice (∼2 min) and resuspend it in the ice-cold IPP150 buffer.\nNote: Use 3 mL of ice-cold IPP150 buffer per 1 g of the yeast cell powder.\nCritical: Protease and phosphatase inhibitors are critical for the stability of proteins and their post-translational modifications during the extraction step. In our experience, the lack of protease and phosphatase inhibitors in extraction of the IPP150 buffer leads to significant degradation of proteins and loss of their post-translational modifications and might prevent successful isolation of native protein complexes.\nTo extract the proteins, gently rotate the tubes with lysates on a rotatory wheel in the cold room (4°C) for 30 min.\nOptional: To generate homogenous lysates, the samples can be sonicated. The sonication conditions need to be adjusted to reduce the generation of foam and splashes. Always keep the tubes with lysates on ice. Note that some protein complexes are sensitive to sonication.\nWe homogenize yeast cell powder resuspended in IPP150 buffer in 300 mL centrifuge tube, kept on ice, using MSE Soniprep 150 set at 6 amplitude microns (5 cycles of 10 s and 30 s cooling periods in between cycles).\nOptional: In case the isolated TAP-tagged protein is bound to chromatin, the IPP150 buffer can be supplemented with Benzonase. Benzonase is a nuclease used for digesting DNA and releasing nuclear proteins associated with DNA. Typically, we use the ice-cold IPP150 buffer with Benzonase (20 U/mL) and Mg2+ ions (MgCl2, 1 mM) to activate Benzonase.",
    "Transfer the lysate to clean centrifuge tubes. To remove cell debris, centrifuge the tubes at 40,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. Transfer the supernatant into a clean centrifuge tube and repeat the centrifugation step three more times (40,000 g, 10 min, 4°C).\nCritical: It is difficult to remove all of the supernatant containing the extracted proteins without disturbing the pellet. We advise to use pre-cooled large volume pipet to transfer the protein extract into fresh and clean centrifuge tubes.\nTransfer the clean protein extract into 50 mL Falcon tubes.\nOptional: To remove remaining cell debris, the protein extract can be filtered (0.22 μm) before freezing in liquid nitrogen. Note that some proteins may remain bound to the filter.\nOptional: Transfer 50 μL of protein extract in an ice-cold 1.5 mL tube and store at −20°C. It can be used later to analyze the expression and stability of TAP-tagged protein.\nCritical: The stability of proteins in a crude extract is time sensitive, hence it is important to complete the protein extraction in a timely manner.\nProceed to the affinity purification steps or snap-freeze the protein extract in liquid nitrogen.\nPause point: Frozen protein extracts can be stored at −80°C for up to one month. Note that some protein complexes are sensitive to freezing and thawing.\nTandem affinity purification\nTiming: 7 h\nThese steps describe tandem affinity purification of TAP-tagged proteins together with co-purifying proteins.",
    "Take 500 μL of IgG beads and mix with 10 mL of ice-cold ddH2O (this amount of beads is sufficient for one sample) in 15 mL Falcon tube. Gently spin the beads (400 g, 4°C, 1 min) and remove the supernatant. Wash the IgG beads with 5 mL of ice-cold IPP150 buffer (without protease and phosphatase inhibitors added). Spin again at 400 g at 4°C for 1 min. Remove the supernatant.\nNote: Never resuspend the IgG beads by vortexing. Resuspend the IgG beads by gently pipetting instead.\nCritical: Do not use more than 500 μL of IgG beads for one protein purification. The IgG beads have a high binding capacity, and increasing the amount of IgG beads does not necessarily result in more TAP-tagged protein binding, but it may lead to increased unspecific protein binding.\nNote: The IgG SepharoseTM 6 Fast Flow binds ∼3 mg protein A/ml and has working interval over a pH range of 3.0–10.0.\nResuspend the IgG beads in 2 mL of ice-cold IPP150 buffer and mix with the protein extract. Gently incubate the sample on rotatory wheel at 4°C for 2 h to allow proteins bind to IgG beads.\nLoad the IgG beads with bound proteins onto an empty Econo-Pac chromatography column and drain by gravity flow. Wash the beads with 20 volumes (10 mL) of ice-cold IPP150 buffer and with 5 volumes (2.5 mL) of ice-cold TCB.\nNote: Do not forget to wash the Econo-Pac chromatography column with ice-cold ddH2O and ice-cold IPP150 buffer before use.\nNote: Make sure the IgG beads with bound proteins do not dry during the collection and washing steps.",
    "Transfer the IgG beads with bound proteins into clean 2 mL Eppendorf tube. Adjust the volume to 1 mL with TCB and add additional 1 mL of TCB supplemented with 400 U of TEV protease.\nGently incubate the sample on rotatory wheel at 16°C for 2 h to allow the TEV protease to cleave the TAP-tag, thus releasing the proteins of interest from IgG beads.\nLoad the cleaved sample onto an empty Poly-Prep chromatography column and collect the flow-through fraction by gravity flow. After collecting the cleaved sample, gently overlay the beads with 200 μL of TCB and collect the flow-through by gravity flow. Combine the flow-throughs and adjust the volume of sample to 2 mL with TCB.\nNote: Do not forget to wash the Poly-Prep chromatography column with ice-cold ddH2O and ice-cold TCB before use.\nMix 2 mL of flow-through fraction and 6 μL of 1 M CaCl2 to titrate the EDTA present in TCB.\nTake 100–150 μL of calmodulin beads (this amount of beads is sufficient for one sample) and mix with 10 mL of ice-cold ddH2O in 15 mL Falcon tube. Gently spin (800 g, 4°C, 1 min) and wash the beads with 5 mL of ice-cold CBB1. Spin again at 800 g at 4°C for 1 min and remove the supernatant.\nNote: The Calmodulin SepharoseTM 4B has ligand density of 0.9–1.3 mg/ml and working interval over a pH range of 4.0–9.0.\nResuspend the calmodulin beads in 6 mL of CBB1 and mix with flow-through fraction from step 12 in 15 mL Falcon tube.\nGently incubate on rotatory wheel at 4°C for 2 h.\nLoad the calmodulin beads with bound proteins onto the empty Poly-Prep chromatography column and collect them by gravity flow.",
    "Note: Do not forget to wash the Poly-Prep chromatography column with ice-cold ddH2O and ice-cold CBB1 before use.\nWash the calmodulin beads with bound proteins with 10 volumes (1–1.5 mL) of ice-cold CBB1 and 5 volumes (0.5–0.75 mL) of ice-cold CBB2.\nNote: Make sure the calmodulin beads with bound proteins do not dry during the collection and washing steps.\nElute the proteins bound to Calmodulin beads using 100–150 μL of EB. After adding the EB wait for 3–5 min before collecting the eluate. Collect 8–10 eluate fractions into Protein LoBind Eppendorf tubes.\nNote: Prior to further analyses (e.g., mass spectrometry), the purity and complexity of eluted fractions should be checked by separating the proteins using SDS-PAGE electrophoresis followed by silver staining (Rabilloud et al., 1988[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). Usually, we analyze 10% of each eluate fraction to find the peak fractions.\nPause point: Eluates can be stored at −80°C for several weeks.\nPreparation for mass spectrometry analysis\nNote: Steps 19–40 are optional and should be used only if mass spectrometry analysis of purified proteins is needed.\nProtein digestion\nTiming: 12 h\nAdd 0.5 μL 1 M DTT (5 mM) to 100 μL of eluted fraction of interest. Incubate for 30 min at 60°C to reduce the protein disulfide bonds.\nNote: In case the yield of eluted proteins is low, pool several eluate fractions and analyze them as a single sample. Increase the amount of reagents accordingly, except for the trypsin.\nAdd 3 μL of 0.5 M iodoacetamide (15 mM) and incubate for 20 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C) in dark to alkylate protein sulfhydryl functional groups.\nAdd 0.5 μL 1 M DTT and incubate 5 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C) to quench the alkylation reaction.\nAdd 2 μL of 50 mM phosphatase inhibitors mix (1 mM each).",
    "Add 4 μL of Sequencing trypsin solution (0.5 μg) and incubate the samples overnight (12–16 h) at 37°C.\nNote: In case of analyzing pooled fractions, do not increase the trypsin according to the sample volume. Indicated amount (0.5 μg) is sufficient to digest the proteins from the TAP experiment. Use bacteriological incubator or dry block heater with heated lid to avoid liquid condensation at the top of the sample tube.\nStop the trypsin reaction by adding 5 μL of 10% TFA (0.5%).\nPeptide desalting using C18 reversed phase chromatography\nTiming: 3 h\nPrepared peptide mixture contains inorganic contaminants from the buffers used in protein elution and protein alkylation that interfere with mass spectrometry analysis. Desalting step is based on peptide capture on C18 column while other buffer components remain in the passing mobile phase. Peptide elution is performed by volatile solution with increased concentration of organic solvent that can be completely evaporated. There are several commercially available peptide desalting kits, such as Thermo Scientific™ Pierce™ C18 Spin Columns, Ultra-Micro SpinColumns (Harvard Apparatus) and C18 Spin Columns (G-Biosciences) with corresponding clean-up protocols for each of them. Here we describe preparation of the C18 desalting microcolumns and their usage for peptide desalting.\nInsert a frit (approx. 1mm x 1 mm) into 200 μL pipetting tip. Push it gently to final place by a paper-clip wire. The frit can originate from, e.g., a narrow aerosol filter used in 10 μL filter tips. Shorten the 200 μL column by cutting the tip below the frit.\nTake 2 mL screw cap tube and make a round hole in the cap to accommodate the microtip column.",
    "Place the column into the tube. When inserting the microtip column, there should be a space left between the tip and the bottom of the tube to eliminate sample contamination. 2 mL tube will serve as a collection tube for the column conditioning and sample washing.\nAdd approximately 50 μL of 50% C18 resin slurry in acetonitrile (ACN) into the microtip column. Mix well the resin before pipetting.\nCentrifuge at 300 g for 1 min. The resin column should be 0.5–1.0 cm tall, depending on the microtip geometry. Discard flow-through.\nAdd 100 μL of ACN to condition and settle the column. Centrifuge at 300 g for 1 min.\nRepeat ACN conditioning step. Discard flow-through.\nAdd 100 μL of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to equilibrate the column. Centrifuge at 300 g for 1 min.\nRepeat 0.1% TFA equilibration step. Discard flow-through.\nApply the sample to the column. Centrifuge at 300 g for 90 s. Discard flow-through.\nNote: In case of larger volumes, apply the sample stepwise in 100 μL aliquots.\nAdd 100 μL of 0.1% TFA to wash the sample. Centrifuge at 300 g for 1 min. Discard flow-through.\nRepeat 0.1% TFA washing step.\nUnscrew the tube lid and place it with the microcolumn into Protein LoBind Eppendorf tube.\nAdd 50 μL of TA70 to elute the peptides. Centrifuge at 300 g for 1 min.\nRepeat the elution step. Pool the eluates.\nDry the eluted peptide sample in a vacuum evaporator.",
    "Note: Prepared peptide sample is ready to be dissolved in the sample buffer for proteomic analysis using nano LC-MS/MS technique. Depending on available instruments in individual proteomic facilities, the samples can be analyzed using various nano HPLC systems (e.g., UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano, EASY-nLC) connected to high resolution mass spectrometers of Orbitrap type (e.g. Q Exactive or Exploris series from Thermo Fisher Scientific) or qTOF mass spectrometers (e.g. impactII, timsTOF series from Bruker Daltonics). Obtained MS data can be processed either by corresponding proprietary software tools (Proteome Discoverer, ProteinScape) or by free software packages (MaxQuant, Perseus)."
