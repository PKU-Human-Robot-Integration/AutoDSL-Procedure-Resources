    "Bone marrow isolation and cell cultureSacrifice mice by CO2 inhalation and cervical dislocation.Remove the fibia and tibia and place in flushing medium on ice.Under a laminar flow hood clean bones, removing excess muscle by scraping with razor blade, and cut ends of bones.Flush bones with flushing medium, using a 10 ml syringe and a fine-gauge needle.Resuspend clumps from bone by passing through the syringe with a 18 G blunt needle.Filter through 100 µM cell strainer.Pellet cells (5 min at 1,200 rpm).Resuspend in 1 to 5 ml RBC lysis buffer, incubate for 5 min at room temperature.Add 14 ml PBS, pellet cells (5 min at 1,200 rpm).Count and wash with PBS.Resuspend cells in BMM medium at a density of 106/ml, plate 10 ml per 10 cm Petri dish. Culture cells for 6 to 7 days at 37 °C, 5% CO2, topping up medium on day 3 and 6 with 5 ml BMM medium.After 6-7 days remove the culture supernatant, wash petri dish once with 5 ml PBS. Adherent macrophages appear flat, with round cell body and extending dendrites. Flow cytometry analysis for macrophage markers, such as F480/CD11b can be used to determine macrophage purity Remove adherent BMMs with 5 ml accutase, leaving petri dishes to incubate at room temperature until cells become rounded and start to lift (around 10 min). Wash cells with PBS.Count and resuspend in BMM medium at 106/ml, and plate 200 µl/well in a flat-bottom 96-well tissue culture plate.Incubate overnight at 37 °C to enable cells to become adherent.StimulationPrime cells: remove cell supernatant and add 200 µl fresh BMM medium with 20 ng/ml ultrapure LPS, incubate at 37 °C for 3 h. For a negative control add medium without LPS. BMMs derived from Caspase1/11-deficient mice can also be used as a negative control.",
    "Note: BMMs require a priming step in order to induce expression of inflammasome components, such as Nlrp3 (Some stimuli may activate NF-κB pathway and induce priming without the need for LPS-priming.).Add stimuli to cells in 50 µl BMM medium, without removing medium with LPS (You can also remove medium with LPS if desired.). Incubate at 37 °C, time depending on the stimulus, e.g. 1 M ATP or 10 mM nigericin for 30 min to 1 h, 300 µg/ml MSU for 6 h. Note: For Helminth inflammasome activation we used HES (5 or 50 μg/ml), pyrogen-free HES (P.HES) (5 or 50 μg/ml) or homogenized Heligmosomoides polygyru (H. polygyrus) L5 parasite (HPL5) (100 μg/ml), and incubated overnight.Spin down the plate (1,400 rpm for 3 min), collect the cell supernatants for ELISA or WB analysis, freeze until use. Note: Aim to collect about 20 -50 μl less than the initial volume you put in.Wash cells 1x with cold PBS and add 40 µl 1x western blot sample buffer supplemented with fresh 10% 1 M DTT directly to cells (can freeze until use or proceed to preparation for WB, below).MeasurementPerform IL-1β ELISA with 50 - 100 µl of cell supernatant as per manufacturers' instructions. Proceed to western blot with samples you want to test further.For cell extracts, pool each triplicate into 1 tube.For cell supernatant, take an aliquot of supernatant and add to 2 parts of 3x western blot sample buffer (with 10% fresh 1 M DTT). Load 20 to 30 μl of the supernatant.Option: concentrate protein from the supernatant:Add equal volumes of supernatant and methanol, and add chloroform 1/8 of the volume of supernatant, mix well. (e.g. 100 μl supernatant + 100 μl  methanol + 12.5 μl chloroform)Centrifuge for 3 min at top speed (in bench-top eppendorf centrifuge).",
    "Remove as much liquid as possible without disturbing the pellet at the interface.Add another volume of methanol (same as initial), mix well.Centrifuge at top speed for 3 min.Remove supernatant, careful not to disrupt protein pellet.Air dry for approx. 20 min.Add 20 to 40 µl 1x western blot sample buffer (with 10% fresh 1 M DTT), depending on how concentrated you want it.Boil samples at 95 °C for 5 min, then cool on ice.Subject 20-30 µl sample to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 15% gel and running buffer.Blot the proteins onto a nitrocellulose membrane using the blot buffer.To ensure loading was even, stain membrane in ponceau red solution for approx. 2 min, wash with distilled water until excess stain is removed, make a copy of the blot for your documentation.Block the membrane by incubating in blocking buffer for at least 5 min at room temperature with mild shaking.Add your antibody, anti-IL-1β or caspase-1 (which detect pro and cleaved forms) (1:1,000 to 1:2,000 in blocking buffer containing 0.05% azide) and incubate overnight at 4 °C with mild shaking (keep antibody source at -20 °C for repeated use).Wash 3 x 5 min with PBS-tween (0.5%) at room temperature with mild shaking.Add HRP-conjugated secondary antibody 1:5,000-1:10,000 in blocking buffer and incubate for 1 h at room temperature with mild shaking.Wash for at least 20 min in PBS-tween (changing the buffer at least 4 times) at room temperature with mild shaking.Dry the membrane on a tissue, immediately lay it over a 1-ml drop of regular or high fidelity ECL solution (on a piece of parafilm or plastic) for 1 min, remove excess solution on a tissue.Develop the blot using standard techniques and equipment (Detection of cleaved IL-1β and caspase-1 in the cell supernatant indicates inflammasome activation.).Repeat steps 9-15 with additional antibodies (e.g.",
    "tubulin for loading control)."
