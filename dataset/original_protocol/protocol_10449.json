    "1. Reactor Assembly\nArrange the reactor components according to the schematic in Figure 1.\n\t\nPlace the reactor (R) on a mixing plate, add a stir bar to the reactor. Place the recycle tank (RT) beside the stir plate and reactor so that the effluent (top) port of the tank is directed towards the edge of the lab bench.\nPlace the waste container (W) underneath the effluent (top) port of the recycle tank (RT). Place the feed tank (FT) next to the recycle tank (RT).\n\t\tNote: The feed tank has a total capacity of 5 L.\nSecure the reactor (R) against tipping with an appropriately sized stand and clamp. Likewise, secure the recycle tank (RT) to prevent movement.\nInsert neoprene peristaltic pump tubing in the recycle (Pump A) and feed (Pump B) pump heads. Refer to the Materials table for additional tubing specifications. Install the pump heads onto the pump drives with the screws provided with the pump drives.\nConnect Pump A's tubing to the ports on the reactor and the recycle tank. Insert the end of Pump B's tubing into the feed tank and the recycle tank. Connect the top reactor port to the recycle tank with tubing. Apply clamps to the tubing at the reactor ports.\n\tNote: Photosynthetic communities may benefit from artificial illumination provided by lamps.\n2. Preparation of Stock Solutions, Influent/Feed Solutions, and Algae Inoculant",
    "Prepare the mineral stock solution. Add the following to a 1 L volumetric flask with 500 ml of deionized water: 200 g sodium bicarbonate, 40 g monobasic potassium phosphate, 4 g magnesium sulfate, 4 g ferric chloride, 4 g calcium chloride, 1 g copper chloride, 1 g cobalt chloride hexahydrate, 1 g nickel chloride hexahydrate, 1 g zinc sulfate heptahydrate. Add an additional 400 ml of deionized water. Swirl forcefully to encourage dissolution of salts. Following dissolution of salts, add deionized water to bring the total volume of solution to 1 L.\nPrepare the ammonia stock solution. In a 1 L volumetric flask, dissolve 38.214 grams of ammonium chloride in approximately 900 ml of deionized water. After dissolution, add deionized water to bring the total volume up to 1,000 ml.\n\tNote: 1 ml of stock solution diluted to 1 L yields a 10 mg L-1 NH4+-N solution.\nPrepare the nitrate stock solution. In a 1 L volumetric flask, dissolve 72.413 g of potassium nitrate in approximately 900 ml of deionized water. After dissolution, add deionized water to bring the total volume up to 1,000 ml.\n\tNote: 1 ml of stock solution diluted to 1 L yields a 10 mg L-1 NO3--N solution.\nPrepare feed/influent solution. To make a feed solution containing 20 mg L-1 NH4+-N and 20 mg L-1 NO3--N, dilute 2 ml of ammonia stock solution and 2 ml of nitrate stock solution to 1 L total volume. Prior to dilution, add 0.5 ml mineral solution/L of solution being made. Prepare 5 L of influent in total to start up the reactor.\nPrepare the algae inoculant.",
    "Collect a large volume (at least 10 L) of water from an algae-containing water body such as a stream or pond. Allow the algae to settle by leaving the water samples undisturbed for 24 hr.\nDecant and discard the clear (non-algae containing) water at the top of the samples, leaving a concentrated algae suspension within the sample bottles. Combine the algae suspension from all of the samples into one container and repeat the settling and decanting steps.\nMeasure the biomass within the concentrated sample.\n\t\t\nDry a paper vacuum filter (0.45 µm MCE vacuum filter) and aluminum weigh boat O/N in an oven which has been set to 103 °C After cool-down in a desiccator for 30 min at RT measure the combined mass of the filter and weigh boat.\nVacuum filter 20 ml of concentrated algae suspension and return the filter and weigh boat to oven to dry O/N.\nMeasure the combined mass of the filter and weigh boat. Calculate the biomass density within the concentrated sample.\n\t\t\tNote: The total volume of water sample that investigators will need to collect will depend upon the source water body.\n3. Seeding and Starting the Reactor\nAdd 750 ml of feed solution to the reactor. Fill the recycle tank with 500 ml of feed solution.\nUse a long pipette to gently add an inoculate suspension containing 1.5 g of algae near the bottom of the reactor. Allow the inoculum to settle to the bottom of the reactor, ensure this by visual observation, before proceeding to the next step.\nOnce the cells have settled, remove the tube clamps and turn on Pump A to a slow flow rate (10 revolutions min-1/38 ml min-1). Air trapped in the tubing will be expelled into the reactor.",
    "Note: The addition of 750 ml to the reactor will prevent any biomass disturbed by the pump from leaving the reactor. Squeeze the tubing to ensure that all air has been expelled.\nGradually add feed solution to the recycle tank as the solution is pumped into the reactor. Continue the addition until both the reactor and the recycle tank are at capacity and effluent starts to exit the recycle tank via the top port.\n\tNote: The volume of feed solution to be added to the recycle tank will vary with the volume of the inoculant added to the reactor.\nPour the remaining feed solution into the feed tank.\nSet the recycle pump (Pump A) to 19 revolutions min-1, establishing a recycle flow rate of 72.5 ml min-1. Observe the algae begin to loft from the bottom of the reactor. Using the gradations on the reactor, determine the algae biomass zone height. Ensure that the height is constant before proceeding to the next step.\nTurn on the mixing plate at very low speed; a setting of 1 or 2 is appropriate to start. The mixing bar will assist in lofting biomass further, but aggressive mixing will cause algae to leave the reactor, enter the recycle tank, and leave in the effluent. Set mixing speed at a setting needed to establish a clear algae boundary within the reactor (Figure 2A); the algal biomass zone should be approximately 10-15 cm in height.\nStart the feed pump after observing a clear boundary between the algal plug and the reactor fluid. Set the pump to 25 revolutions min-1, establishing a flow rate of 1.5 ml min-1. Observe the reactor fluid exit the effluent port due to gravity and displacement caused by the incoming influent stream.\n4. Sample Collection and Analysis",
    "Carry out sample collection activities prior to performing maintenance on the reactor system. Collect 20 ml of effluent and influent samples daily. Collect effluent samples from within the recycle tank. Collect influent samples directly from the feed tank.\nVacuum filter samples to remove suspended solids prior to storage and analysis.\nStore the influent and effluent samples at -20 °C until further analysis. Limit the number of freeze thaw cycles samples are subjected to. If needed, samples can be split into aliquots to maintain sample integrity.\nCarry out sample analysis for nitrate, nitrite, and ammonia using standard techniques17.\n\tNote: The authors utilized Ion Chromatography (IC) to produce the results presented herein.
