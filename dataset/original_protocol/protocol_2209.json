    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nWe have outlined a timeline scheme during the process of reprogramming iPSCs for better comprehension for beginners (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Specific details are discussed below.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1818-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. The timeline scheme with the landmarks during the reprogramming process\nIsolation of PBMCs\nTiming: 2–4 h, day -1\nNote: Isolate PBMCs by gradient centrifugation via PBMC Isolation Kit (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nCollect 2–4 mL of human venous blood in heparinized vials.\nThe sample is diluted with an equal volume of D-PBS and transferred to a new 15 mL tube by gently mixing 2–5 times by inversion.\nPBMCs are isolated according to the Solarbio P8610 technique.\nAdd an appropriate amount of separation solution into the centrifuge tube.\nNote: if the diluted blood volume (with PBS after step 2) is less than 3 mL, add 3 mL of separation solution; if the diluted blood volume is greater than or equal to 3 mL, add an equivalent volume of separation solution. However, the total volume should not exceed two-thirds of the 15 mL tube (10 mL), otherwise, the effect of centrifugation would be compromised.\nSlightly pave the diluted blood above the solution’s surface.\nCentrifuge at 500–1000 g for 20–30 min at RT with the horizontal rotor.\nNote: The larger the volume of blood, the higher the centrifugal force required to achieve a better outcome. The best separation conditions need to be explored and the maximum centrifugation speed should not be more than 1200 g. For example, for 8 mL total volume (the diluted blood and separation solution), we use 500 g, 30 min.",
    "Critical: The amount of separation solution should be equal with the diluted blood sample (with D-PBS). If the total volume (the diluted blood sample and separation solution) is more than 10 mL, the diluted blood sample (with PBS) should be split into two tubes with an equal separation solution.\nAfter centrifugation, from top to bottom, there are the diluted plasma layer, transparent separator layer, lymphocyte layer, and red blood cells and granulocytes (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Gently absorb the lymphocyte layer by a plastic Pasteur pipette (3 mL Pasteur pipette) into a new 15 mL tube.\nWash the lymphocyte layer with 10 mL D-PBS by pipetting the cells up and down 8–10 times (3 mL plastic Pasteur pipette is recommended).\nCentrifuge at 250 g for 10 min at RT.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 10 mL D-PBS. Centrifuge at 250 g for 10 min at RT. Repeat this step.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet with 500 μL D-PBS. Count the number of cells using a hemocytometer.\nPBMCs are frozen in cryopreservation solution or prepared at a density of 1–5 ∗10ˆ6 cells/mL for electroporation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1818-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. A cartoon indicating the four layers of blood after centrifugation with separation solution\n(A) The top layer (yellow) is the diluted plasma layer.\n(B) The middle (white) is the separation solution layer.\n(C) The white membrane layer between the plasma and the isolate is the lymphocyte layer.\n(D) At the bottom of the centrifugal tube is the red blood cells and granulocyte.\nNote: Thaw PBMCs before electroporation and cultured with a PBMCs culture medium at least one night. After electroporation the mixtures including PBMCs and plasmids should be seeded into a 6-well plate coated with 1% (v/v) Matrigel, Geltrex matrix, or MEF-feeder.\nPBMCs electroporation and generation of iPSCs",
    "Timing: 15–20 days, day 0–20\nNote: After many attempts, we found that Geltrex or Matrigel matrix may be a good substitute for MEF-feeder. Whereas the MEF-feeder may be more economical, Geltrex or Matrigel have defined compositions that reduce unknown effects. The steps 24–41 involving the isolation of MEF and preparation of the MEF-feeder are not essential according to the use of MEF-feeder or feeder-free culture. We recommend the use of the feeder-free culture on the grounds of simplicity and ease of use.\nElectroporation of PBMCs may be carried out by Lonza 4D-Nucleofector™ using program EO-015, following the manufacturer’s protocol. (see “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]” for more information).\nPrepare 6-well plates with 1 mL Geltrex/DMEM-F12 or 2∗10ˆ4 cells/cm2 MEF-feeder (see steps 24–41).\nPre-incubate desired volume (maximum 2 mL) of reprogramming medium (StemSpan™-XF with 10% StemSpan™-CC100) at a 37°C water bath.\nPrepare the DNA plasmid solution with a concentration of 1 μg/μL in ddH2O. The plasmids containing hoCT3/4, hsk sox2 KLF4, and L-myc LIN28 encode the reprogramming factors.\nCentrifuge the required number of PBMCs (1–5∗10ˆ6 cells) at 200 g for 10 min at RT. Remove supernatant completely.\nCarefully resuspend the cell pellet at RT with 100 μL 4D Nucleofector™ Solution containing the recommended amounts of DNA plasmid (1 μg of each reprogramming plasmid, 3 μg of total DNA).\nTransfer mixtures containing 1–5∗10ˆ6 number of PBMCs, 100 μL transfection solution, and required DNA plasmid into the Nucleocuvette™ Vessels. Start the program EO-015.\nAfter the program has finished (about 3–5 s), take the Nucleocuvette™ Vessel out of the retainer and immediately place it in a humidified incubator for 5 min.\nGently pipette up and down 2–3 times to mix cells. When working with the 100 μL Nucleocuvette™, use the pipettes supplied and avoid repeated aspiration of the sample.",
    "Seed the transfection cell suspensions into a 6-well plate coated with Geltrex or MEF-feeder. Culture the cells in reprogramming medium (See table \"Reprogramming medium\" of “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]” for more information).\nAfter 4 h of incubation, replace the medium with fresh reprogramming medium. Collect the cells and medium from each well into a 15 mL tube and centrifuge at 300 g for 10 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet with 2 mL of fresh reprogramming medium. This step is necessary to ensure the removal of transfection solution which may damage the cells. This timepoint is defined as Day 0.\nOn day 3, replate cells into a new Geltrex or MEF-feeder coated 6-well plate.\nHarvest the cell suspension into a tube and wash each well with 2 mL of D-PBS, aspirate it and add 700–800 μL TrypLE select reagent to detach the MEF-feeder cells and attached PBMCs. Incubate them for 4 min at 37°C.\nTransfer dissociated cells into previously harvested cell suspension. Centrifuge at 300 g, 10 min, at RT.\nRemove the suspension and resuspend the cell pellets with 2 mL of fresh reprogramming medium before transferring them to a new 6-well plate coated with fresh Geltrex or MEF-feeder.\nOn day 4, add 200 μL mTeSR™1 per well.\nOn days 6, 8, and 10, collect 1 mL of medium and centrifuge at 300 g for 5 min at RT. Remove the supernatant, resuspend the cell pellets in 1.2 mL of mTeSR™1 and replate cells into the original well.\nOn day 11, the medium is replaced completely with mTeSR™1. The culture medium should be replaced daily by simply aspirating the media and adding 2 mL fresh mTeSR™1.\nDay 12–25: Perform daily medium changes (2 mL/well) using mTeSR™1. Monitor the cells until iPSC colonies appear.",
    "Note: iPSC colonies typically form 10–20 days after electroporation. At 4× magnification, the cells appear as packed clusters under the microscope. For a representative example of an iPSC colony (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\niPSC clones should be identified and selected for amplification (step 16) when colony boundaries become blurred (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1818-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Magnification 4×, scale bar 50 μm.\nSelection and amplification of iPSCs\nNote: Prewarm mTeSR™1 medium and 96-well plates coated with Matrigel or Geltrex at RT (15°C–25°C) before operation.\nUnder a microscope at 10× magnification, remove the majority of the medium, leaving about 100–200 μL.\nBreak up the putative iPSC colony into small fragments using a pipette. Scrape and aspirate the colony fragments using a 200 μL pipettor.\nSeed the iPSC colony fragments into a 96-well plate coated with Geltrex or Matrigel matrix. Culture with 100 μL mTeSR™1 and 10 μM Y-27632 at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nAfter 24 h, replace the medium with 100 μL mTeSR™1 without Y-27632.\nThe culture medium should be changed daily with 100 μL fresh mTeSR™1.\nCells should be passaged when they achieve 70% confluence.\nGradually passage the iPSCs into 48\\24\\12\\6-well plates. For example, after 2–3 passages in 96-well plates, iPSCs should be amplified into 48-well plates with the ratio of 1:1.\nWhen cell numbers are enough (at least six 6-well plates), we prefer performing functional verification tests.\nIsolation of mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF)\nTiming: 1–7 days, day -7∼-1",
    "Note: The steps 24–41 involving the isolation of MEF and preparation of the MEF-feeder are optional and are not needed when coated plates are chosen instead.\nHarvest embryos at embryonic day (E) 13.5 from CF-1 mice.\nNote: Prepare 0.1% gelatin to coat-plates (5 mL 0.1% gelatin per 10 cm dish) and incubate in 37°C for 30 min (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nPregnant mice (day 13.5) are sacrificed by cervical dislocation and immersed in 75% ethanol.\nCut through the full thickness of the skin with sterile scissors, then pull back the skin to expose the abdominal wall.\nWith fresh sterile scissors, cut through the abdominal wall. Use forceps to lift the uterine horns and excise the uterus with scissors. Avoid allowing the uterus to come into contact with the fur. Place the uterus in a 50 mL tube with 30 mL DMEM with antibiotics to avoid potential contaminants from the mice.\nSeparate the day 13.5 embryos and transfer them to a new 10 cm dish with fresh DMEM or D-PBS to wash out the blood.\nDiscard the head, heart, liver, and four limbs. Mince the remaining embryos as finely as possible (about 1 mm3 pieces) with a scalpel and digest in 50 mL tubes with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (use 10 mL 0.25% trypsin EDTA for every 2–3 embryos).\nPut the tube in a 37°C water bath for 15–20 min, mixing the cells every 3–5 min.\nPut the cell suspension and equal volume of medium (DMEM+10% FBS) onto a plate to inactive the trypsin. Homogenize by pipetting with a 1 mL pipet 8–10 times until no lumps are visible.\nFilter the cell suspension through a 70 μm strainer into a new tube.",
    "Centrifuge at 300 g, 5 min at RT. Discard the supernatant and re-suspend the cell pellet in a 1 mL MEF culture medium. Transfer the cell suspension to 10 cm dishes pre-coated with gelatin and add 9 mL medium.\nIncubate cells at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator.\nRefresh medium daily and passage every 1–3 days when the cells reach 70% confluence (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). The passage ratio should be 1:4 to 1:7 (appropriately 2∗10ˆ4 cells/cm2).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1818-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Magnification 4×, scale bar 50 μm.\nAfter 2 or 3 passages, non-adherent cells may be removed by aspirating the medium and the resulting MEFs may be utilized as feeder cells after mitotic inactivation using mitomycin C.\nNote: The protocol of passage, cryopreservation, and thawing of MEFs are described in the final parts of this protocol.\nPreparation of the feeder\nTiming: 1–2 days, day -1\nNote: Prepare 0.1% gelatin to coat-plates (10 cm dish) and incubate in 37°C incubator for 30 min.\nAfter the growth of the 3rd passage MEFs to 80%–90% confluence, remove the medium from the 10 cm dish and rinse cells twice with 10 mL of D-PBS.\nAdd 10 mL of freshly prepared MEF inactivation medium, consisting of 9 mL of MEF medium and 1 mL 100 μg/mL mitomycin C (final concentration 10 μg/mL mitomycin C). Incubate cells for 2–4 h in a 37°C incubator.\nRemove the medium containing mitomycin C and rinse 3–5 times with 8–10 mL of D-PBS.",
    "Detach MEFs with 3 mL 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and incubate at 37°C for 1 min. Add 3 mL medium to inactivate the trypsin-EDTA and transfer to a 15 mL tube. Centrifuge at 300 g for 5 min at RT, and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend cells with MEF culture medium and adjust cell density.\nAdd cell suspension to a 6-well plate precoated with 0.1% gelatin (about 2∗10ˆ4 cells/cm2) and culture in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator.\nNote: As indicated in steps 24–41, prepare the MEF-feeder seeded in 6-well plates with 2∗10ˆ4 cells/cm2 and culture with MEF culture medium until PBMCs are fed in. (See “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]” for more information.).\nAnalysis of iPSC\nImmunofluorescence staining\nPlace glass coverslips in a 24-well (14 mm) plate and coat them with Geltrex or Matrigel as described in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment].\nSplit iPSCs as detailed in supplement protocol “iPSC passaging” and plate them into prepared coverslips.\nNote: The diluted ratio can range from 1:60 to 1:100, for example, iPSC reaches 80%–90% confluence of a well of 6-well plate can be diluted into 1:80 and plate into 14 mm coverslips.\n1–3 days later (when iPSC colonies acquire round shape morphology with smooth edges), remove supernatant and wash cells with PBS twice.
