    "All methods described here were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Hampden-Sydney College or Randolph-Macon College (where some work was previously performed).\n1. Basic Housing of Mice\nHouse the mice in plastic cages with solid bottoms and sides, and a layer of soft bedding and nesting material such as paper shredding. Use bedding that is composed of shredded corn cobs or wood shavings, and ensure that the bedding is changed regularly for sanitation.\nProvide access to food and water ad libitum. The top of the plastic cage houses a food hopper. Dispense properly formulated mouse food pellets from the food hopper and provide a water dispenser. Ensure that the cage top features an air filter to protect mice from outside contaminants.\nMaintain the natural circadian rhythms of the mice by following a 12-hour light-dark cycle in the housing facility. Conduct behavioral testing at the same time of day, ideally during the animal's dark cycle, such as during the evening hours.\n\tNOTE: Care should be taken to distinguish mice in the housing. Various methods for distinguishing mice are available, such as ear punches, ear tags, and tail markings.\n2. Barnes Maze Testing: Construction\nObtain a circular wooden board that is 120 cm in diameter.\nCut 20 circular holes (4.5 cm in diameter) around the perimeter of the circle. Position each hole to be 2.5 cm away from the maze edge and 13 cm apart from neighboring holes.\nSmooth the surfaces and paint them glossy white (a bright color is recommended).\nDesignate one side of the maze board for insertion of small cup hooks roughly 2-3 cm away from each of the 20 holes and place two hooks for each hole (one on either side of each hole).",
    "Use shallow black (plastic) disks for covering holes on side of maze with hooks. Use hooks to secure thick rubber bands in order to hold the disks onto the bottom of the maze.\nSecurely mount the Barnes maze 120 cm above the ground and away from other similarly tall objects like tables or chairs. A box or stool can be used to support the middle of the maze.\nPlace large white posters with one shape on each wall (triangle, circle, and cross) as extra-maze cues on 3 sides of the maze. Maintain the posters on the walls around the maze for each trial.\nOn last side of maze, set up a solid black curtain to hide observers so that data can be recorded accurately without the researchers being visible to mice on the maze.\nSuspend a video camera over the arena with a bird's-eye view of the entire maze surface.\nClean every surface of the maze (black disks and target box included) with water then a 70% ethanol solution before and after each mouse trial.\nPlace a 100 W light source 25 cm over center of maze (turn on/off at the start/finish of trial) and be sure to have the disks and hooks facing the floor.\n\tNOTE: All other overhead lights in the room should be turned off during testing. The addition of an ultrasonic noise maker hung next to 100 W light is recommended. Turn it on/off at the start/finish of each trial.\n3. Barnes Maze Testing: Procedure\nNOTE: Ensure that all the maze components are cleaned with water and 70% ethanol solution before and after each trial, allowing for time to dry completely before testing resumes. Be sure to have cleaning supplies ready as well as timers for the trials.",
    "House all the mice in groups while using a reliable identification method. Keep mice outside of the testing room when they are not actively running on the maze. This is to ensure they are not subjected to the ultrasonic noisemaker prematurely.\nHandle mice by gently picking up and holding them from the base of the tail, with the paws kept on one's hand.\nFor training, have the mice run on the maze daily once per day for 7 days in a row to assess learning/acquisition.\n\tNOTE: A single long-term trial can be done on a later date to assess memory/retention. The current protocol trained adolescent mice beginning at postnatal day 32 and a long-term trial was performed in adults at 4 months of age.\nRandomly assign each mouse to a target hole to use throughout the testing period. The holes can be labeled 1-20 on the bottom of the maze or on the outside of the maze perimeter, where they are not visible to the mouse in the maze.\nReplace the assigned hole disk with a small black box (23 x 11 cm). Firmly attach it to the Barnes maze using rubber bands connected to the nearest hooks.\n\tNOTE: The target box is shallow enough so that the mouse can easily step down into it or contains a step to ensure that the mouse does not have to jump down into it.\nPlace the mouse onto the center of the maze beneath a cup to acclimate for 30 seconds until the test begins. Begin video recording.\nTurn on the light and ultrasonic noisemaker. Lift the cup via a string mechanism to avoid biasing the initial heading of the animal. Start a timer and sit behind the curtain to observe.",
    "After the mouse enters the target hole, cover the hole with the same opaque cup used at the start of the trial or a binder and turn off the ultrasonic noisemaker. If the mouse has not entered the target after 5 minutes have elapsed, corral the mouse into the target hole.\n\t\nEnsure the mouse enters the hole. When mouse is inside the target box, cover the hole and turn off the noisemaker. Allow the mouse to remain in the target box for 1 minute undisturbed.\nAlthough the target hole will remain constant for each mouse throughout the training period, run mice in a random order each day to ensure that they are not following any cues/scents left by the previous mouse.\n4. Barnes Maze Testing: Data Analysis\nDuring the Barnes maze trials, record the following timed data: total time spent on maze, time to find target, and time to enter target hole if the target is entered.\nTrack the overall movement of the mouse to determine the number of errors (number of incorrect holes explored) before and after the target is found. Also record the distance from the target hole to the first hole explored (distance is measured in number of holes away), along with any notable grooming behavior.\nTrack the movements of each animal on a piece of paper with a diagram of the maze during each trial and use it to analyze search strategies, as well as determine the number of holes that were explored in the quadrant opposite the target. Use video analysis to confirm the paths.\n5. Damsel-in-Distress Testing: Constructing the Restraint Chamber",
    "Cut a clear cylinder to a length equal to ¾ of the length of the female mouse from the base of the tail to tip of the nose. Ensure that the dimensions of the cylinder are such that the mouse placed inside cannot turn around.\n\tNOTE: We cut the cone end of a 50 mL conical tube down to make a 4 cm long tube for 1-month-old mice and an 8 cm long tube for 4-month-old mice.\nCap both ends of the cylinder such that one of the caps can be removed and reattached. Punch 3-4 holes, approximately 0.5 cm each, in each cap. Ensure that the holes are large enough to allow nose-touching between mice and breathing12.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, a device for mouse restraint during blood collection can be used.\n6. Damsel-in-Distress Testing: Preparing the Arena\nEnsure that the arena is an opaque topless plastic square box of 38 x 38 cm with 19 cm walls. Fill it uniformly with corn bedding to a height of approximately 2.5 cm.\n\tNOTE: The corncob bedding makes digging events easier to detect.\nSuspend a video camera over the arena so that the entirety of the arena is in view.\n7. Damsel-in-Distress Testing: Exploratory Behavior Measure\nPlace the closed and empty stress chamber into the center of the arena.\nBegin recording with the suspended camera.\nSelect a male mouse. If the mice are marked for identification, note this male's identity; if not, mark this mouse so that it can be distinguished after returning to the cage.\nGently place the male mouse beneath a cup at the lower left corner in the arena. After 30 seconds, remove the cup via a string mechanism.",
    "Allow the mouse to explore for 10 min, taking care to stay out of its field of view during recording. At the end of the 10 min, remove the mouse from the arena and return it to a holding cage for the next 5 min12.\nStop recording and save the video file with an appropriate identifier.\n8. Damsel-in-Distress Testing: Social Responsiveness Measure\nUse the same arena and recording setup as in the exploratory behavior measure.\nSelect a female mouse. If the mice are marked for identification, note this female's identity; if not, mark this mouse so that it can be distinguished after it is returned to the cage.\n\tNOTE: A littermate, cage mate, or novel mouse can be used, depending on the research question. If multiple trials are being performed, maintain the type of relationship across all trials.\nHold the female mouse gently by the base of the tail, or by neck restraint, if necessary, and lower it into the restraint chamber. Close the open end behind it and ensure that it is unable to turn around.\n\tNOTE: Consider wearing bite-resistant gloves, as the female mouse will be resistant to entering the restraint chamber.\nBegin recording with the suspended camera.\nPlace the restraint chamber with the trapped female mouse inside in the center of the empathy arena and allow the female to acclimate for 10 min. Take care to remain out of the female's field of view.\nAfter the female mouse has been in the restraint chamber for 5 min, place the marked male mouse back into the empathy arena using the same process as before. Allow the male mouse an additional 5 min to explore the arena, again taking care to remain out of the field of view of the mice.",
    "Stop recording and save the video file with an appropriate identifier.\nAt the end of the 5 min, remove both mice from the arena and place them into their cages. Replace the corn bedding and sanitize both the arena and the stress chamber with 70% ethanol12.\n9. Damsel-in-Distress Testing: Data Analysis\nTracking software can be used, but the video can also be analyzed manually. Once the video file is visible on the computer, overlay a transparent sheet over the screen and outline the square of the arena using a marker. Divide the arena square into nine equal compartments.\nReview the video data for the first 5 min of the initial exploratory measure. Record the number of compartments crossed (locomotor activity/exploratory behavior), time spent in the center square of the arena (open field aversion), number of digging and grooming episodes, and number of times the mouse touched the empty center restraint chamber.\n\tNOTE: Scoring is not done for the second 5 min of the male's 10-minute initial exploration, nor for the 10 min the female is trapped in the central chamber in the absence of the male.\nReview the video data for the 5 min of the social responsiveness measure immediately after the male is reintroduced into the arena with the trapped female. Record the same data as for the initial exploratory measure, but additionally record the number of times the male mouse touched noses with the trapped female mouse.\nSubscription Required.
