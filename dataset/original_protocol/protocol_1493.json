For human monocyte isolation, please refer to steps 4–27. For human PMN isolation, please refer to steps 28–45.\nIsolation of the PBMC layer and platelet removal\nTiming: For steps 4–16: ∼1 h\nThis section describes an efficient way to purify viable human monocytes, which can be studied directly or further differentiated into human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs; please refer to Kratz et al. (2014)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6].\nNote: Keep the isolation temperature at 18°C–22°C.\nCarefully aspirate and discard the top plasma layer until ∼5–10 mm above the interphase of the PBMC layer (left, Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). Be careful not to disturb the PBMC layer.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1036-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. PBMC isolation\n(A) Photographs of the PBMC layer with plasma 5–10 mm above it (left), and the appearance of the solution after transferring to a new 50 mL conical tube (right).",
    "(B) Photograph of the turbidity change in the supernatant with each successive wash and 300×g spin.\nUse a transfer pipette to harvest the PBMC layer. Transfer it into a new 50 mL conical tube (right, Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nNote: A transfer pipette is desirable over pouring the layer out for two reasons. First, we have found that the dense PBMC layer can stick to the tube wall. A transfer pipette is better able to dislodge and recover all PBMCs. Second, if one intends to isolate neutrophils from the lower layer (see below), pouring may disrupt this lower layer and require additional centrifugation.\nCritical: The PBMC layer from each LeucosepTM tube should not be combined. They should each be transferred into separate 50 mL conical tubes. For example, if you started with 45 mL of blood, you would have three LeucosepTM tubes and three PBMC layers, which should be transferred to three 50 mL conical tubes. If all PMBC layers are combined into one 50 mL conical tube, three washes will not effectively minimize platelet contamination (see steps 6–8).\nResuspend cells in a small volume first (1 mL) and then top up to 50 mL with PBS/EDTA for each wash.\nCentrifuge at 300×g at 18°C–22°C for 8 min.\nGently aspirate out the supernatant and repeat steps 6–8 at least twice, or until the supernatant is clear (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nNote: The 300×g centrifugation steps helps to eliminate platelets, which pellet at higher speed spins. The supernatant of each spin should get progressively clearer (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). If not, repeat until the supernatant is clear. We empirically selected 300×g because it optimizes recovery of monocytes and platelet removal. Eliminating platelets is important because they can stick to monocytes leading to contamination and affect monocyte viability and/or activation (Inui et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]; Zhou et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]).",
    "Combine all cell pellets by resuspension in 1 mL 1× RBC lysis buffer. Transfer cells to a new 50 mL conical tube and add 1× RBC lysis buffer up to a final volume of 10 mL.\nNote: 10 mL of 1× RBC lysis buffer is sufficient for PMBCs isolated from <90 mL of undiluted blood. For higher volumes of blood, additional tubes should be used.\nIncubate at 18°C–22°C for 5 min.\nNeutralize RBC lysis buffer by adding 10 mL of PBS/EDTA.\nCentrifuge at 500×g for 5 min at 18°C–22°C.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend cells in 10 mL isolation buffer per 50 mL blood volume.\nCount cells.\nNote: For cell counting, cell concentration may require adjustment.\nCount cells and set aside 0.5 million cells for flow cytometry analysis.\nPerform flow cytometry analysis (see steps 46–50).\nNote: The resultant cells are referred to as PBMCs, of which monocytes account for ∼10%–20%.\nCritical: Human primary monocytes are generally subdivided into three populations: (1) classical monocytes, which account for majority of the total monocytes and are characterized as CD14+CD16− or CD14++ (high expression) CD16−); (2) intermediate monocytes, which accounts for ∼2%–8% and are characterized as CD14dimCD16+; (3) non-classical monocytes, which account for ∼2%–11% of total monocytes and are characterized as CD14+CD16+ (Ziegler-Heitbrock, 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]; Sampath et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). Flow cytometry should be used to quantify each population (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). If the classical monocytes is <80% of the total monocytes, this could indicate an active infection or chronic inflammatory condition in the donor. We have discarded such samples. However, this decision depends on the goals of the study.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1036-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Flow cytometry analysis of PBMCs",
    "Flow cytometry gating strategy to analyze PBMCs. CD14 and CD16 were used to distinguish low-density neutrophils (LDNs), non-classical monocytes, intermediate monocytes, and classical monocytes. Gray = negative control; Red = labeled sample.\nIsolation of human monocytes\nTiming: For steps 17–27: ∼1 h\nThis section illustrates positive selection of CD14+ monocytes by magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) from Miltenyi Biotec. Another widely used method is EasySep human monocytes or CD14 positive selection kit from Stem Cell technology. Both methods have a comparable cost, time efficiency, and purity of isolation. But the equipment required (e.g., magnet, separator, etc.) is not interchangeable. Although we have not compared these two methods side by side, there could be functional differences of isolated monocytes for downstream activation. For example, one study showed that monocyte-derived dendritic cells showed better response to tumor antigens and hence better ability to induce T cell cytotoxicity against tumors when monocytes were prepared using MACS from Miltenyi Biotec compared to EasySep from Stem Cell technology (Marques et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).",
    "In addition to positive selection, plastic adhesion and negative selection are two other methods used in the field. Plastic adhesion takes advantage of monocytes’ fast and strong adherence to tissue culture plates, while negative selection labels all other cell types except monocytes for magnetic selection. However, plastic adhesion results in lower yield and less than 50% purity. Negative selection can result in heavy contamination with platelets (Nielsen et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). This is consistent with our observations and hence we prefer positive selection and present a detailed protocol here. Admittedly, negative selection provides the advantage of avoiding the attachment of microbeads to monocytes, which might affects their function for downstream application (Bhattacharjee et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). And platelet removal cocktail in combination with negative selection (e.g., monocyte negative isolation kit, EasySep from Stem Cell) could circumvent the contamination issue. Nevertheless, we have not observed changes of expression level of CCR2 or CX3CR1, chemokine receptors that have been associated with activation, pre- and post-positive selection nor any hampered functionality of isolated monocytes.\nCritical: From this point forward, samples should be kept at 4°C to preserve monocyte viability. Adjust the centrifuge temperature to 4°C and keep all buffers on ice.\nCentrifuge cells at 500×g for 5 min.\nGently aspirate the supernatant and add 80 μL isolation buffer + 20 μL CD14 MicroBeads for up to each 10 million cells. If 10–20 million cells, adjust to 160 μL isolation buffer + 40 μL CD14 MicroBeads. If 20–30 million cells, adjust to 240 μL isolation buffer + 60 μL CD14 MicroBeads.\nCritical: Mix the MicroBeads thoroughly (by gently vortexing or pipetting) to create a homogenous solution immediately before adding to cells.\nGently mix the CD14 MicroBeads with cells and incubate for 15 min at 4°C.",
    "Critical: For best results, incubate samples in a 4°C fridge, not on ice, which is lower than 4°C and could have variable temperature.\nTop up to 30 mL with isolation buffer and centrifuge at 500×g for 5 min at 4°C.\nWhile samples are spinning, set up the magnetic stand and column.\nNote: For <10 million cells, an MS column should be used. For >10 million cells, an LS column should be used. The procedure below describes the use of an LS column as an example. Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for MS columns: https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/ms-columns.html#gref[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/ms-columns.html#gref].\nCritical: Place the columns tightly in the magnet. Be aware that the LS column has a front and back face and should be oriented properly into the magnet with the front face out (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). Place a tube or reservoir below the column to collect flowthrough and washes (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nEquilibrate the column by passing 3 mL isolation buffer through it.\nRemove samples from the centrifuge and aspirate the supernatant. Resuspend pellet in 1 mL isolation buffer (for up to 106 cells) and transfer to the column.\nNote: The manufacture’s instruction is to use one LS column for 107–2 × 109 total cells. We found that a maximum of 1 × 108 PBMCs per LS column is ideal for an efficient positive selection (i.e., won’t clog the column).\nAfter the cell suspension passes through the column, wash with 3 mL isolation buffer three times.\nRemove the column from the magnetic rack and place it in a 15 mL conical tube for collecting monocytes (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nAdd 5 mL isolation buffer and immediately push the solution through the column with a plunger into a collection tube (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nCount cells and save 0.2 million for flow cytometry analysis.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1036-Fig5.jpg",

Magnetic column set up to obtain CD14+ cells\n(A) Photograph of setting up the LS column on a magnetic stand.\n(B) LS column transferred to a 15 mL conical tube.\n(C) Elution of monocytes with a plunger.\nIsolation of human PMNs\nTiming: For step 28–45: 1–2 h\nThis section describes an efficient way to remove red blood cells and purify human PMNs.\nCritical: Keep the temperature at 18°C–22°C for the entire isolation as human PMNs can be activated by temperature changes.\nAspirate the layer above the porous barrier.\nRemove the porous barrier with a 2 mL sterile serological pipette and tweezers (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A, Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nCritical: If the bottom RBC layer is disturbed during barrier removal (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B), centrifuge the tube at 500×g for 5 min at 18°C–22°C with the brake off. If the RBC layer is undisturbed, proceed to step 30.\nAspirate and discard the Ficoll-Plaque PLUS gradient carefully without disturbing the dark red pellet.\nTop up to 50 mL with 1×RBC lysis buffer for each tube (tube 0).\nCentrifuge tubes at 500×g for 5 min at 18°C–22°C (tube 0).\nCritical: Centrifugation here will not pellet all PMNs. Therefore, once centrifugation is complete, we do not aspirate any media. Instead, we perform additional RBC lysis steps (33–34) by dividing tube 0 into three tubes (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nDirectly transfer top 20 mL from this tube (tube 0) into a new tube (new tube 1), and the next 20 mL out into another new tube (new tube 2).\nAdd 30 mL and 40 mL 1×RBC lysis buffer to new tubes 1/2, and tube 0 respectively.\nIncubate at 18°C–22°C for 5 min.",
    "Critical: If the number of tubes generated above exceeds the capacity of the centrifuge, stagger the resuspension step to avoid prolonged exposure to RBC lysis buffer, which will also lyse PMNs and lead to the appearance of a ‘gooey’ cell pellet. In this case, the PMN prep is compromised, and a new blood sample should be obtained.\nCentrifuge tubes at 500×g for 5 min at 18°C–22°C.\nGently remove supernatant and resuspend pellet in 1 mL 1×RBC lysis buffer.\nCombine up to six tubes together and top up to 50 mL with 1×RBC lysis buffer.\nIncubate tubes at 18°C–22°C for 5 min.\nCentrifuge tubes at 500×g for 5 min at 18°C–22°C.\nCritical: If cell pellets are white or contain a thin red ring above a white pellet, proceed to step 41. If cell pellets remain red, repeat steps 38–40 to further eliminate RBCs.\nNote: RBC susceptibility to lysis varies between donors.\nAspirate the supernatant and wash the cell pellet with 15 mL PBS.\nCentrifuge at 500×g for 5 min at 18°C–22°C.\nGently remove supernatant.\nResuspend cells in PBS (∼1–5 million cells/mL). Typically, 50 mL of blood yields ∼50–200 million PMNs.\nNote: Depending on the cell counting method, you may need to adjust your cell concentration to obtain an accurate cell count.\nSet aside 0.5 million PMNs at 18°C–22°C for flow cytometry analysis.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1036-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

    "This section describes a method for assessing monocyte and PMN purity by flow cytometry.\nStain 0.2 million purified monocytes or PMNs with the following panels in a flow tube at 18°C–22°C for 15 min or 4°C for 30 min.\nNote: For monocytes, use anti-CD14, anti-CD11b (monocyte markers), and a cell viability dye (calcein blue, cBlue, 10 μM final concentration, stains live cells positive). For PMNs, use anti-CD16, anti-CD10 (mature neutrophil markers [Marini et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]]), and cBlue. 1 uL of each antibody tested here could be used for 0.2 million cells. Refer to manufacturer’s instructions for concentration for other antibodies catalogs that are not listed here. Because only cell surface markers are being tested, no fixation is required.\nNote: Use 0.2 million cells for negative and/or isotype control.\nAdd 700 μL of flow staining buffer to each flow tube.\nCentrifuge at 500×g for 5 min at 18°C–22°C.\nGently discard the supernatant.\nAdd 300 μL flow staining buffer and analyze in a flow cytometer.\nCritical: PMNs have a very short half-life (∼7 h) in healthy individuals, and they will naturally cycle to apoptosis (Saverymuttu et al., 1985[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; Dancey et al., 1976[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Following isolation, we observed that they started undergoing apoptosis within 2 h and almost all are dead within 24 h. Long-term cell culture is not possible with these cells."
