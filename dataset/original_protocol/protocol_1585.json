Clip the lower eyelid with a bulldog clamp and secure the eyeball to a steady position (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1150-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Note the mark of injection volume and air segment separating the AAV solution and mineral oil.\n(D) Illustration of mouse eyeball and intravitreal injection. The lens of mouse eyeball is relatively big. The micropipette should not touch the lens or the retina. Created with BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com].\n(E) Insertion of the micropipette behind the ora serrata.\n(F) Injection of virus into the vitreous. Leave a small portion of the virus solution in the micropipette to avoid air or oil into the vitreous.\n(G) Postoperative care. Pre-warm the heating pad and underpads when starting the experiment.\nIntravitreal injection\nLoad a set volume of AAV solution into micropipette. A good strategy is to draw a line on the micropipette to mark the injection volume (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). This will help keep the injection volume consistent and reduce variations among animals.\nThe lens of the mouse eyeball is relatively big. So the angle and the inserting depth of the micropipette should be well adjusted to avoid touching the lens or the retina (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).",
    "Insert the micropipette just behind the ora serrata (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E). (Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1])\nHold the micropipette steady, and slowly push the plunger to inject the virus solution into the vitreous with the other hand. If the virus solution contains fast green, the operator will notice the dye spreading inside the vitreous. Control the speed of injection (10–15 s/μL) and leave a small portion of the virus solution in the micropipette to avoid air or oil into the vitreous (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F). (Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3])\nHold the micropipette in position for a few more seconds and gently pull it out of the eyeball. (Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5])\nAfter intravitreal injection, release the bulldog clamp, and let the eyeball stand for 30 s. Gently move the eyelids with forceps to help the eyeball back into orbit.\nCritical: The whole process of intravitreal injection should be performed smoothly and quickly, as too long or too slow manipulations may result in eyeball dryness.\nPostoperative care\nApply antibiotic ointment onto the eye to prevent infection and dryness.\nPut the mouse on underpads warmed by a heating pad (37 degrees Celsius) in a container (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G).\nCritical: Use new underpads for every cage of mice to avoid possible animal fighting.\nMonitor the condition of the mouse periodically until it wakes up, then put it back into the cage and return it to the animal facility.\nPause point: Wait two weeks after intravitreal AAV injection before proceeding to the next step.\nInducing injuries to RGCs\nTiming: 2 h\nThis section describes the procedure of two methods to injure RGCs: NMDA-induced excitotoxicity and optic nerve crush.\nMouse anesthesia\nUse the anesthesia method described in step 1. Then proceed to either step 6 or step 7.\nNMDA-induced excitotoxicity",
    "Intravitreal injection of a high dose of NMDA (20 mM, 1.5 μL) will induce severe excitotoxic damage to RGCs (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1150-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Methods to induce RGC injuries\n(A and B) Excitotoxicity induced by intravitreal injection of NMDA. (A) NMDA loading in the micropipette. (B) Injection of NMDA into the vitreous.\n(C–H) Procedures of optic nerve crush. (C) Mouse head immobilization on the head holder. (D) Eyeball alignment in the viewing field center of microscope. (E) Exposure the back of eyeball. (F) Opening the connective tissues covering the optic nerve. (G) Lowering the focal plane of microscope to focus on the optic nerve. (H) Crushing the optic nerve with a designated pair of forceps. Scale bar, 1 mm.\nOptic nerve crush\nAfter anesthesia, secure the mouse head position using the head holder (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nCritical: Unexpected head movement during surgery may cause the failure of the crush.\nTurn the head holder to make the right eye face upward for a right-handed operator (or make the left eye face upward for a left-handed operator), and align the eyeball in the viewing field center of the surgical microscope (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nUse a pair of forceps to expose the eyeball from the ventral/temporal side (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E). Use another pair of forceps to open the connective tissues covering the optic nerve (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F). Adjust microscope focal plane to focus on the optic nerve (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G). Use a designated pair of forceps to crush the optic nerve for 5 s at approximately 1 mm behind the globe (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]H). (Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7])\nCritical: Before performing surgery on each mouse, clean all surgical instruments with 75% ethanol.",
    "Critical: The tips of a pair of forceps will have a high chance of abrasion and deformation if they are being used for multiple purposes, resulting in failures of the crush, such as incomplete nerve crush and bleeding. Use a designated pair of forceps for crush will help keep consistency between operations. Keeping the crush time and site consistent will also help get more objective conclusions.\nNote: If bleeding happens, euthanize the animal and exclude it from the study.\nAfter optic nerve crush, restore the eyeball into the orbit of the eye socket and release the mouse head.\nPostoperative care\nPerform all the postoperative care procedures described in step 4.\nPause point: Wait one week after NMDA injection or two weeks after optic nerve crush before proceeding to the next step.\nRetina collection and immunohistochemistry\nTiming: 2 days\nClear and definitive labeling of RGCs is a prerequisite for RGC quantification. Immunohistochemistry using antibodies recognizing neuron-specific class III beta-tubulin (Tuj1) is a well-established method to label and count RGCs after injuries (Park et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Compared to RBPMS (another reliable RGC marker that predominantly labels RGC somas), Tuj1 immunohistochemistry also provides information on the morphology of RGC dendrites and nerve fiber conditions. This section describes the procedures of retinal sample collection and Tuj1 immunohistochemistry for retinal whole-mounts.\nTranscardial perfusion of mice We routinely perfuse the mouse before tissue collection, as it facilitates immunohistochemistry with primary antibodies of mouse origin and helps preserve morphology of the retina.\nUse the anesthesia method described in step 1.\nPerform rapid transcardial perfusion with 4% PFA according to general procedures, which we will not detail here.\nOne sign of a good perfusion is the paling and hardening of the liver (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1150-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Procedure of retina collection and immunohistochemistry",
    "(A) Transcardial perfusion of mice. Note the difference of liver color before (left) and after (right) perfusion.\n(B) Post-fixation of the eyeball in 4% PFA.\n(C) Putting plate on a shaker during fixation.\n(D) Dissection of the retina. Care should be taken to keep the retina intact. Scale bar, 1 mm.\n(E) Cutting the retina into a cross shape. Scale bar, 1 mm.\n(F) Transferring and spreading the retina cross on a slide, with the RGC side facing up. Scale bar, 1 mm.\n(G) Mounting of the retina with mounting medium and cover glass.\nEnucleation and post-fixation of the eyeball\nRight after perfusion, enucleate the eyeball using a pair of forceps.\nClean up the eyeball in PBS and make a small opening on the cornea.\nCritical: A small opening on the cornea will help preserve the shape of the eyeball during fixation.\nTransfer the eyeball into 2 mL 4% PFA in a well of 24-well plate (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B), and put the plate on a shaker for 1–2 h at room temperature (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nRetina dissection\nAfter fixation, dissect the retina out of the eyeball (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nGently and thoroughly clean the inner surface of the retina with forceps or a synthetic sable paint brush.\nCritical: Some non-retinal structures/tissues near the ganglion cell layer may interfere with RGC staining.\nCut the retinal cup into a cross shape (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nPause point: Once dissected out, retinas can be stored in PBS at 4 degrees for a few days.\nTuj1 immunohistochemistry in retina whole-mounts\nTransfer the retina into a 1.5 mL tube, and incubate in 1.2 mL blocking buffer for 1 h.\nIncubate the retina in 200 μL primary antibody (Tuj1) solution (1:250) at room temperature overnight (16–20 h).\nWash the retina in 1.2 mL PBS 3 times for 15 min each.",
    "Incubate the retina in 200 μL secondary antibody solution (1:500) at room temperature for 2 h.\nWash the retina in 1.2 mL PBS 3 times for 15 min each.\nCritical: For antibody incubation, make sure that the retina always stays at the bottom of the tube and is fully immersed in the solution. All incubation and washing steps should be carried out on a shaker.\nTransfer the retina on a slide, with the RGC side facing up (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F). Remove PBS solution, apply Fluoromount-G mounting medium, and mount with a cover glass (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]G).\nCritical: Level the cover glass horizontally will help make the subsequent imaging steps easier and faster.\nPause point: Leave the slide in dark for 1–2 days to let the mounting medium semi-dry before proceeding to the next step.\nConfocal microscopy and RGC quantification\nTiming: 2 days\nThe RGC density in the mouse retina varies in different quadrants as well as different distances from the optic disc. To achieve objective assessment of RGC numbers among animals in different treatment groups, it is critical to sample multiple regions in retinal flat-mounts from all quadrants at a fixed radius. This section describes the procedures of confocal imaging and RGC quantification.\nImage acquisition\nWe take confocal images of retinal whole-mounts using a Zeiss LSM 800 microscope with a 20× objective lens to image a 320 × 320 μm square area.\nNote: The size of the imaging area may vary due to specific objective lens as well as the equipment brand and settings.",
    "The center of the sampling square is located at ∼500 μm from the edge of the retinal flat-mounts leading to the optic disc. Tuj1 immunostaining labels both RGC somas and axons. Based on our experience, there are less dense RGC axons and discernible RGC somas for counting in these regions.\nFor the above imaging size and position, we sample 3 squares in each petal of the retinal whole-mount, and a total of 12 squares for one retinal whole-mount are sampled (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A top).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1150-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Bottom: Maximum intensity Z-projection to generate a composite image for RGC counting.\n(B) RGC counting using ImageJ. The retinal whole-mount image here was recently published (Guo et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\n(C) Schematic diagram of data collection and analysis to obtain RGC survival results. Created with BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com].\nFor each square, take Z-stack confocal images focusing on RGC somas and do maximum intensity Z-projection to generate a composite image for RGC counting (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A middle and bottom).\nPause point: Collected and stored images can be analyzed later at any time.\nRGC counting\nDownload and install Fiji ImageJ (https://imagej.net/software/fiji/[href=https://imagej.net/software/fiji/]) (Schindelin et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nTo count RGC numbers in each image, open the image in ImageJ and click “Plugins>Analyze>Cell Counter” to open the control panel.\nClick “Initialize” in the “Actions” region, the image will be in Counter Window (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nChoose one “Type number” in the “Counter” region, a dot will appear in the circle on the left of the type number.",
    "Note: The software allows different colors for each type. Usually, one type is enough for simple RGC counting. More types are used to count multiple sub-classes of cells.\nClick each RGC soma once to count RGCs. A dot will mark the cell after a click. The number of RGCs in an image will appear in the rectangle on the right of the type number.\nQuantification and statistical analysis\nAverage RGC numbers from all 12 squares in a retina.\nFor each experimental group, collect multiple retinas for quantification. 3-6 retinas are reasonable numbers.\nCalculate “mean” and “standard deviation (s.d.)” for comparison among groups (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nMake graphs using GraphPad or other statistical software. In addition to absolute numbers of RGCs, the percentages of RGCs relative to those in the uninjured retina can be easily calculated. Both the absolute numbers and percentages of RGCs relative to the uninjured retina are helpful information to evaluate RGC survival after experimental manipulations/treatments (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B and 6D).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1150-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.
