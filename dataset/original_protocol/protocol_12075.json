    "The following protocol uses zebrafish adults maintained and cared for by the Center for Zebrafish Research at the University of Notre Dame. All methods for working with zebrafish adults and embryos were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Embryo Fixation\nCollect zebrafish embryos using previously described methods39,40. At 24 hpf, add 500 µL of non-specific protease mixture solution (50 mg/mL) to the E3 in an embryo dish Incubate at room temperature (RT).\nOnce embryos begin breaking out of the chorion, remove all liquid from the embryo dish.\nWash the embryos 2 - 3 times with fresh E3 by adding approximately 20 mL of E3, gently swirling the E3 in the dish, and then decanting the fluid into a liquid waste receptacle.\nTo euthanize the embryos before fixing, add 2 mL of 0.2% tricaine to the E3.\nTransfer the embryos into a 5 mL glass vial using a plastic Pasteur pipette. Remove most of the tricaine/E3 solution using the pipette after the embryos have settled to the bottom of the vial.\nFix 24 hpf embryos with 5 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 2 - 4 h at RT, without agitation.\n\tCAUTION: PFA is toxic and PFA solutions should be handled under a chemical hood while the researcher is wearing eye protection, gloves, and a lab coat. Preparation of the PFA fixative from the granulated PFA powder should be performed with exceptional care, as the granulated PFA tends to disperse through static charge.",
    "NOTE: Embryos can fix in 4% PFA overnight at 4 °C. Prepare 4% PFA by heating 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to a boil while continually stirring the solution to completely dissolve the granulated PFA. Once the solution has cooled back down to RT, the 4% PFA is filter sterilized by passing it through a 0.45 µm disposable system for vacuum filtration, then and aliquoted into 15 mL or 50 mL portions for storage at -20 °C.\nRemove the 4% PFA and wash embryos twice with 1X phosphate buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST) at RT. Wash the embryos once with 5 mL of 100% methanol (MeOH) at RT. Add 5 mL of fresh 100% MeOH to the embryos and incubate at -20 °C for at least 20 min.\n\tNOTE: Embryos can be stored in 100% MeOH at -20°C until ready for embryo preparation.\n2. Embryo preparation and hybridization\nRehydrate the embryos by washing once in 5 mL of 50% MeOH in 1x PBST for 5 min at RT. Continue rehydration by washing the embryos in 5 mL of 30% MeOH in 1x PBST for 5 min at RT. Wash the embryos in 5 mL of 1x PBST twice for 5 min each at RT.\nPermeabilize the embryos by incubating them in 5 mL of a solution of 1:1,000 proteinase K (pK) (10 mg/mL) in 1x PBST for 2 min at RT.\n\tNOTE: Older embryos can be incubated longer than 2 min in the pK concentration stated above, however a concentration of 5 mg/mL and incubation time less than 2 min is suggested for embryos younger than 24 hpf.\nRemove pK solution and wash immediately in 5 mL of 1x PBST twice at RT. Fix the embryos in 5 mL of 4% PFA at RT for at least 20 min.",
    "NOTE: Embryos can fix in 4% PFA overnight at 4 °C.\nRemove PFA and wash twice in 5 mL of 1x PBST at RT.\nTransfer embryos in 5 mL of 1x PBST into flat bottom microcentrifuge tubes placed upright into a microcentrifuge rack at RT to facilitate interactions between each embryo and the subsequent hybridization solution.\nWash the embryos twice in 1.5 mL of hybridization solution (Hyb+) at RT. Add 1.5 mL of fresh Hyb+ and incubate embryos at 70 °C in a hybridization oven for 4-6 h.\nReplace the 1.5 mL of Hyb+ with a volume of probe solution (10 µL RNA probe/500 µL Hyb+) sufficient to fully cover the embryos.\n\tNOTE: Synthesize antisense RNA probe using previously described methods39.\nHybridize the probe overnight in the hybridization oven at 70 °C with the individual tubes positioned upright in the microcentrifuge rack, without shaking.\n3. Hot Washes and Blocking\nNOTE: Hot washes are performed by putting the appropriate solution on the embryos and then incubating in the hybridization oven at 70 °C. To keep the washing solutions at 70 °C, place 50 mL tubes of each solution in the hybridization oven when the probe/Hyb+ mixture is added.\nRemove the probe. Wash the embryos twice at 70 °C in 1.5 mL of 50% formamide/2x saline-sodium citrate (SSC) buffer for 20-30 min each.\n\tNOTE: The probe can be stored in Hyb+ at -20 °C and re-used at a later date.\nWash the embryos once at 70 °C in 1.5 mL of 2x SSC for 15 min. Wash the embryos twice at 70 °C in 1.5 mL of 0.2X SSC for 20-30 min each. Replace 0.2x SSC with 1.5 mL of blocking reagent and incubate overnight at 4 °C.",
    "NOTE: It is possible to incubate blocking reagent at RT for 4 h instead of overnight.\n4. Antibody Incubation and Maleic Acid Buffer Washes\nNOTE: Keep embryos protected from ambient light.\nReplace the blocking reagent with 0.2 mL of anti-DIG-POD in blocking reagent at a ratio of 1:1,000 and incubate for 3 h under foil or another light-blocking cover at RT.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, the antibody can incubate overnight at 4 °C.\nAfter 3 h, wash the embryos in 1.5 mL of maleic acid buffer 2-4 times for 10-15 min each at RT. Incubate the embryos overnight at 4 °C in 1.5 mL of fresh maleic acid buffer.\n\tNOTE: It is not necessary to incubate in maleic acid buffer overnight, but doing so decreases probe background.\n5. Probe Detection and Removal of Peroxidase\nNOTE: Keep embryos protected from ambient light.\nRemove maleic acid buffer and replace with 1.5 mL of 1x PBS. Wash embryos twice in 1.5 mL of 1x PBS for 5 min each at RT. Incubate embryos in 0.2 mL of Cy3 fluorescent staining solution for 60 min at RT.\n\tNOTE: Incubation time may vary for different probes.\nWash the embryos once with 1.5 mL of the following percent MeOH in 1X PBS for 10 min at RT: 30% MeOH, 50% MeOH, 75% MeOH and 100% MeOH.\nIncubate the embryos with 1.5 mL of 1% H2O2 in MeOH for 30 min at RT. Wash the embryos once with 1.5 mL of the following MeOH solutions in 1x PBS for 10 min at RT: 75% MeOH, 50% MeOH, and 30% MeOH. Wash the embryos twice for 5 min each at RT in 1.5 mL of 1x PBS.\n\tNOTE: Embryos can be stored in PBS overnight at 4°C.\n6. Immunofluorescence\nNOTE: Keep embryos protected from ambient light.",
    "Wash the embryos in 1.5 mL of ddH2O for 5 min at RT. Wash the embryos in 1.5 mL of pre-chilled acetone (kept at -20 °C) for 7 min at RT. Wash the embryos once in 1.5 mL of ddH2O for 5 min at RT. Wash the embryos once in 1.5 mL of 1x PBST with 1% DMSO (PBDT) for 5 min at RT.\nIncubate the embryos in 1.5 mL of PBDT + 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) on a rocker at RT for 2 h.\nRemove PBDT + FBS and replace with 1.5 mL of primary antibodies, anti-acetylated tubulin (produced from mouse) and anti-γ-tubulin (produced from rabbit), diluted together at 1:400 in PBDT + 1% FBS. Incubate the embryos overnight at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: Incubation times may vary depending on the primary antibody. Testing of different time intervals may be necessary to optimize labeling.\n7. Secondary Antibody\nNOTE: Keep embryos protected from ambient light.\nTo remove excess unbound antibody from the embryos, wash in 1.5 mL of PBDT + 1% FBS + 0.1 M NaCl for 1 min at RT on a rocker.\nWash the embryos 5 times in 1.5 mL of PBDT + 1% FBS + 0.1 M NaCl for 30 min each on a rocker at RT. Wash the embryos in 1.5 mL of PBDT + 1% FBS for 30 min at RT on a rocker.\nIncubate the embryos overnight at 4 °C in 200 µL of the secondary antibodies, Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa 647 goat anti-rabbit IgG, diluted together in PBDT at 1:500.\n8. DAPI Staining\nNOTE: Keep embryos protected from ambient light.",
    "Wash the embryos quickly at RT in 1.5 mL of PBDT two times. Replace PBDT with 1.5 mL of DAPI, diluted 1:15000 in 1X PBST, and incubate 15 min at RT on a rocker.\nWash the embryos in 1.5 mL of PDBT + 1% FBS + 0.1 M NaCl three times at RT for 15-20 min each. Store embryos in 1.5 mL of PBDT at 4 °C until ready to mount and image.\n9. Mounting and Imaging for Zebrafish Pronephros\nLay embryo lateral on glass slide in a small volume, approximately 10 µL, of PBDT.\nSqueeze the embryo behind the eyes with a pair of fine forceps to remove the head and some of the yolk ball.\nUse the fine forceps to gently scrape away the remaining yolk ball from the embryo body. Remove the dissociated yolk and extra liquid from the slide with a thin tissue.\nAdd a drop of mounting media to the remaining tail of the embryo and position so the tail is laid laterally. Place a coverslip on top of the tail to flatten the sample, then place in a covered slide box.\nImage kidney cilia at 60X magnification on a confocal microscope using the following channels: DAPI in blue (laser set at 408.0 nm), FITC in green (laser set at 488.0 nm), Cy3 dye-labeled in red (laser set at 561.0 nm), and Alexa 680 in white (laser set at 637.0 nm)."
