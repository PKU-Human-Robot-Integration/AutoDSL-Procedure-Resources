Alternatively, you can get commercially available buffy coats and skip step 1.\nCollection of human peripheral blood mononuclear lymphocytes (PBMCs).\nUse MCS®+ 9000 Mobile Platelet Collection System to extract 100 mL PBMCs from the peripheral blood of volunteers.\nLymphoprep™: PBMCs:PBS = 1:1:1.\nFully mix PBS and PBMCs with the same volume in centrifuge tubes.\nPlace the same volume of lymphoprep ™ below the mixing solution. Indeed the PBS: PBMC is layered ON TOP of the Lymphoprep solution and not vice versa.\nCritical: Due to solution density issues, take care of the Lymphoprep™. Make sure it is not mixed with blood and PBS before centrifugation.\nTake the middle white film layer after centrifugation (393 g, 23 min, acceleration 0, acceleration 0, 4°C) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nWash by adding one volume of PBS (167 g, 5 min, acceleration 9, deceleration 9, 4°C), and collect the cell pellet. (e.g., 1 mL leukocyte suspension with 1 mL PBS).\nAdd the same volume of PBS as the supernatant, and repeat step.1.d 3–5 times until the liquid was clear.\nCollect all the cell pellets and count PBMCs.\nNote: All of the work with Lymphoprep needs to be at 25°C. Temperature fluctuations will result in poor separation. And all subsequent work (after PBMC isolation) is performed ‘ON ICE’.\nIsolation of CD4+CD25+CD127- nTregs.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2068-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "(A) Human peripheral blood mononuclear lymphocytes (PBMCs) were sorted from samples extracted by MCS®+ 9000 Mobile Platelet Collection System.\n(B) The number of cells obtained by magnetic column sorting at each step. On the first negative selection (NS) step, CD127- cells were sorted from PBMCs. On the second negative selection step, CD4+CD127- cells were got. On the third positive selection (PS) step, CD4+CD25+CD127- nTregs were finally received.\n(C) The purity of CD4+ CD127- cells were identified after NS selection, and the purity of CD4+CD25+CD127- nTregs were identified after PS selection on day 0.\n(D) State of nTregs after selection on day 0 under the microscope (10×).\nResuspend cell pellet in 30 μL of PBS per 10⁷ total cells.\nNegative selection of CD127- T cells.\nAdd 10 μL of FcR Blocking Reagent and 10 μL of CD127 Biotin per 10⁷ total cells.\nMix well and incubate for 10 min in the refrigerator (2°C–8°C). Add 30 μL of PBS and 20 μL of Anti-Biotin MicroBeads per 10⁷ total cells.\nMix well and incubate for 15 min in the refrigerator (2°C–8°C). Wash cells by adding 10–20 mL of PBS per 108 cells and resuspend up to 10⁸ cells in 500 μL of PBS.\nProceed to magnetic separation and place it in the magnetic field of a suitable MACS Separator.\nAfter rinsing the LS Column with 2 mL of PBS, apply cell suspension to the column.\nTake unlabeled cells that pass through the column and two 1 mL PBS washing steps are done on the same cell suspension.\nCentrifuge cell suspension, discard the supernatant, and count cells.\nNegative selection of CD4+CD127- T cells.\nFor each 10⁷ total cells, suspend the cell pellet in 90 μL of PBS.",
    "To this, add 10 μL of CD4+ T Cell Biotin-Antibody Cocktail and incubate for 5 min in the refrigerator (2°C–8°C).\nMix well and incubate for another 10 min in the refrigerator (2°C–8°C) with 20 μL of Anti-Biotin MicroBeads per 107 cells.\nRepeat steps 2.d. and 2.e.\nPositive selection of CD4+CD25+CD127- nTregs.\nCentrifuge cell suspension and count cells.\nResuspend cell pellet in 90 μL of PBS.\nAdd 10 μL of CD25 MicroBeads, mix well and incubate for 15 min in the dark in the refrigerator (2°C–8°C).\nWash cells by adding 1–2 mL of PBS, centrifuge, and resuspend up to 10⁸ cells in 500 μL of PBS.\nPlace MS Column in the magnetic field of a suitable MACS Separator.\nRinse the column with 500 μL of PBS, apply cell suspension to the column, and wash the column with 500 μL of PBS.\nRemove the column from the separator, and place it on a suitable collection tube.\nPipette 1 mL of PBS onto the column. Push the plunger firmly into the column to flush out the magnetically labeled cells immediately.\nCentrifuge cell suspension and count cells (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nIdentification of nTregs by flow cytometry.\nSave an aliquot after each separation step and check each aliquot for purity.\nTake 0.3∗106 cells in 100μL FACS buffer.\nFor each tube, add staining antibodies, 0.5 μL of CD4-BV510, 0.5 μL of CD25-PE, 0.5 μL of CD127-FITC, and 0.1 μL of LIVE/DEAD™ and vortex.\nIncubate in the refrigerator (2°C–8°C) for 15 min in the dark.\nWash cells with 500 μL FACS buffer, decant the supernatant and retain about 100 μL residual volume.\nNote: Wash the stained cell suspension before being analyzed by flow cytometry to remove unbound.\nThe stained cells were resuspended in 500 μL FACS buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).",
    "Note: About 0.3–1.0 million nTreg can be obtained from the starting cell number of 100 million.\nAlternatives: Most of the time we choose FACS buffer. If there is no FACS buffer temporarily, you can choose PBS instead.\nCulture of natural human regulatory T cells (nTregs)\nTiming: 18 days\nThis step describes the activation and culture of nTregs.\nWash Human T-Activator CD3/CD28 Beads.\n106 nTregs need 25 μL Human T-Activator CD3/CD28 Beads.\nPlace the magnetic bead suspension in the 1.5 mL tube.\nPlace the tube in a magnetic stand and aspirate the liquid after the magnetic beads attach to the inner wall of the tube.\nAfter magnetic beads were resuspended with PBS, repeat step 4.c.\nRepeat 4.c and 4.d 3–5 times, and obtain magnetic bead precipitation.\nCritical: The preservation solution of Human T-Activator CD3/CD28 Beads is cytotoxic, thus requiring washing the beads three times with PBS (Gu et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nCulture for the first 9 days.\n106 nTregs were cultured in 1 mL complete medium (10% Fetal Bovine Serum and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin Solution in Lymphocyte Serum-Free Medium). Select a suitable culture container according to the volume of the liquid, and the culture liquid needs to cover the bottom of the container.\nAlternatives: Regular serum-based media can be used to culture Tregs.\nAdd 25 μL Human T-Activator CD3/CD28 Beads to 106 cells, 300 IU/mL IL-2, and 100 nM/mL retinoic acid (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nCritical: The relative quiescence of the whole culture system should be maintained within 48 h after adding Human T-Activator CD3/CD28 Beads.",
    "After 48 h of incubation (36.7 Temp°C, 5.1% CO2), one volume of complete medium was added. 300 IU/mL IL-2 and 50 nM/mL retinoic acid were added to the total volume. (e.g., 1 mL initial culture volume, addition of 1 mL incubation solution, 600 IU IL-2 and 100 nM retinoic acid).\nObserve the cultural solution daily. If the color turns yellow, add IL-2, retinoic acid, and complete medium as above.\nNote: Be careful to change flasks in time to ensure adequate growth space during the rapid cell proliferation phase (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). If the total volume of the culture medium exceeds 2/3 of the bottle volume, the flask needs to be replaced.\nNote: The cell proliferation phase is rapid (day 8–15), nutrient consumption is rapid and metabolites are acidic, making the culture fluid yellow.
