    "The protocols for animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Houston Methodist Research Institute and carried out in accordance with all regulations, applicable laws, guidelines, and policies.\n1. Rat Lung Harvest\nAnesthetize a 4- to 6-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rat by an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) in its flank. Ensure anesthesia by checking for an absence of movement when the hind limb toe is pinched with forceps. \nAfter 10 min, shave the chest and abdomen and wipe the skin with a chlorhexidine swab.\nRemove the skin by picking it up with forceps and by incising it with a disposable scalpel. After opening the thoracic cavity by incising with scalpel, perform a bilateral thoracotomy by cutting the anterior side of the rib cage on the left and the right side of the diaphragm with scissors.\n\tNOTE: This is a non-survival surgery.\nHold the rib cage up and inject 2 mL of heparin (1,000 units/mL) into the right ventricle of the beating heart using a 27 G needle.\n\tNOTE: This will prevent any formation of blood clots in the lung.\nCompletely remove the rib cage with scissors and place an 18 G needle in the left ventricle as a vent, until the blood comes out. Then, inject 15 mL of heparinized phosphate-buffered saline (12.5 units/mL; heparinized PBS) into the right ventricle using a 25 G needle.\nCut the inferior and superior vena cava, two large veins on the right side of the heart, and flush the lungs with an additional 10 mL of heparinized PBS in the right ventricle using a 27 G needle.",
    "NOTE: The inferior vena cava is visualized under the bottom of the heart as a big vessel filled with red blood. Similarly, the superior vena cava is visualized in the upper part of the heart as a big vessel.\nCut the trachea at the base of the thyroid. Carefully remove the descending aorta at the level of the hemiazygos vein and branches of the aorta at the arch.\nTake out the heart-lung block from the thoracic cavity and the rest of the rat body.\nPerform ventriculotomy by cutting half of the right and left ventricles and place a custom-made prefilled 18 G stainless-steel needle cannula through the right ventricle into the main pulmonary artery (PA).\nSecure the cannula with a 2-0 silk tie and carefully expose the right ventricle and atrium.\nPlace a female Luer bulkhead in the left ventricle and secure it with a 2-0 silk tie.\nFlush the heart-lung block with 20 mL of heparinized PBS through the PA cannula and place it in a 50 mL tube containing culture media or heparinized PBS.\n\tNOTE: For a cellular model, go to step 3.1 to set up the bioreactor. For an acellular model, proceed to step 2.1 for the decellularization.\n2. Lung Decellularization\nPreparation of the decellularization unit\nPrepare each decellularization chamber/bottle by piercing two holes in the bottle cap and snapping a female Luer in the holes (Figure 1A and 1B). Secure it with a black nylon ring on the other side. Similarly, drill a single hole in another bottle cap for the intravenous set attachment (Figure 1C).\n\t\tNOTE: Figure 1A and 1B are of the same bottle caps from two different sides. Figure 1C is of a different cap with a single hole as stated above in step 2.1.1.",
    "Attach a 0.5-inch tube (at the pulmonary artery or PA end) and 6-inch tubes (Figure 1J) to a female Luer from inside the bottle caps (Figure 1A and 1B) and attach a male Luer lock at the ends. Set the lock with a 500 mL bottle as the decellularization chamber/bottle.\nConnect one end of two 2 ft tubes (which are connected with a male Luer lock) to either ends of the pump tube (Figure 1H), which is attached to the pump head (Figure 1E and 1F) by a cartridge (Figure 1G) with a female Luer lock (Figure 1I).\nConnect the other ends of the 2 ft tubes (from step 2.1.3) each to a female Luer lock head on the decellularization chamber/bottle cap (Figure 1L).\nSet up a 250 mL heparinized PBS bottle (with 200 mL of PBS) by hanging an inverted bottle on a stand with the proximal end of an intravenous set (Figure 1D) inserted in the bottle cap and the distal end replacing the 2 ft tube connected to the decellularization chamber/bottle at the PA end (Figure 1B). Connect this 2 ft tube to the discard bottle.\n\t\tNOTE: The bottles are set in cardboard, as shown in Figure 1K. The intravenous tubes come out of the hanging bottles to dispense reagents in the lung scaffold.\nLung decellularization process\nRun the heparinized PBS at a physiologic perfusion pressure of 30 mm Hg (Figure 1K) until it flows freely in the decellularization chamber/bottle and, then, attach the heart-lung block to the PA end through the PA cannula.\nKeep running the pump continuously, so that any excess buffer/solution inside the decellularization chamber/bottle gets discarded.\nRun the heparinized PBS through the PA for 15 min at a perfusion pressure of 30 mm Hg for the initial wash (Figure 1K).",
    "Replace the heparinized PBS bottle with 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in deionized water and perfuse the lung for 2 h for the decellularization.\nAfter the decellularization, perfuse deionized autoclaved water through the lung scaffold for 15 min.\nThen, perfuse 1% non-ionic detergent in deionized water for 10 min.\nReplace the decellularization chamber/bottle with 500 mL of autoclaved PBS supplemented with 1x antibiotics (penicillin-streptomycin amphotericin), keeping the hanging lung intact with the cap inside the bottle.\nDiscard the intravenous set, put the 2 ft tube attached to the discarding container back to the pulmonary artery end of the decellularization chamber, and run the pump at 6 mL/min (Figure 1L).\nPerfuse the lungs for 72 h and keep changing the PBS with antibiotics every 12 h.\n\t\tNOTE: The acellular lung is ready for immediate use. It can be stored at -80 ˚C until needed. If pink spots or blood clots can be visualized clearly in the lung lobes, discard the lung. It is possible to randomly test for DNA or histopathology. A complete acellular lung will not show cells and 99.9% of the DNA will be washed off.\n\t\tNOTE: When working with a cellular lung model, skip the decellularization. The harvested lung (step 1) can be directly set in the bioreactor.\n3. Bioreactor Set-up\nPrepare the bioreactor bottle and the items required for the set-up.\n\t\nDrill three holes in one 500 mL bottle cap at an equal distance and fix a female Luer in all three holes, using black nylon rings (Figure 2A and 2B).\n\t\tNOTE: In two holes, the Luer lock ends face the outside, while one end faces the inside of the bottle.",
    "Cut a 6 in pump tube, a 2 in tube, a 6 in tube, a 1.5 ft tube, a 2 ft tube, and a 10 ft oxygenator tube per bioreactor.\nCut an 18 G stainless-steel needle and, again, connect the ends with biocompatible tubing for a tracheal cannula.\nWrap the oxygenator tube, with Luer lock connectors at the ends, on a solenoid wire mesh using autoclave tapes (Figure 2C).\nAutoclave the above-mentioned items and keep them in UV light for 10 min.\nSet up the pump inside the regular cell culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) with proper spacing between the trays to easily fit a 500 mL bottle.\nSpray 70% ethanol on the pump cartridge and connect the pump tube with female Luer lock connectors on both ends to the pump.\nSet up the oxygenator wrapped around the solenoid wire mesh inside the cell culture incubator by connecting one end (the outflow) of the oxygenator to the pump tube and the other end with the 1.5 ft tube in the bioreactor.\nSet up the bioreactor bottle in a biosafety cabinet with aseptic conditions.\n\t\nAttach a 3-way stopcock (yellow) to the head of one of the female Luers to control the flow through the PA.\nConnect a one-way stopcock (blue) to another female Luer lock bulkhead for cell seeding through the trachea (Figure 2F).\nConnect 2 in tubing on the outside (white) and 6 in tubing on the inside of the bottle to circulate the media out. Fit a male Luer lock to a 2 ft tube and attach a female Luer lug style Tee to provide accessibility to add or remove anything.\nAttach a one-way stopcock to one of the openings of the three-way connector (female Luer lug style Tee).",
    "Attach a male Luer lock and a female Luer lock to 2 ft tubes.\nAdd 200 mL of RPMI1640 with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics cell culture medium (varies as per cell requirement) and transfer the bioreactor to the incubator. Connect the oxygenator tube to the two open ends (one-way stopcock and Tee connector) to make it a closed-loop bioreactor.\nPre-run the pump at 6 mL/min inside the cell culture incubator with cell culture media to fill the oxygenator and tubes, so that no air bubbles exist in the tubing.\nOnce the tubes are filled with media, close the stopcock and remove the bioreactor bottle from the incubator by disconnecting the oxygenators from both ends of the bioreactor bottle.\nPut the bioreactor bottle in the biosafety cabinet, pass culture media through the stopcock, and attach the PA cannula of the lung scaffold (acellular or cellular) to the stopcock through the male Luer connector.\n\tNOTE: Here it is possible to use the acellular model (following the decellularization process) or a freshly harvested heart-lung block (i.e., the cellular model, as it retains the native rat cells).\nPass culture media through a one-way stopcock to remove any air and tie the tracheal cannula by a silk thread to the trachea.\nMake sure to avoid any twisting of the PA and trachea. Close the bioreactor bottle cap with the lung scaffold inside and, again, aseptically transfer the bioreactor to the incubator and start the pump at a 6 mL/min speed.\nRun culture media for 10 - 15 min to make sure all lobes get inflated and the lung looks in good shape (Figure 2G).\n4. Metastasis Model and Cell Seeding",
    "NOTE: Proceed to cell seeding with the above lung model for a primary tumor growth study. Modify the lung scaffold (acellular or cellular) as follows for the metastatic model.\nTake out the bioreactor with the lung scaffold from the incubator and put it in the biosafety cabinet.\nUse a Luer lock syringe to pass 5 mL of culture media through the trachea and open the bioreactor cap with the hanging lung scaffold (Figure 2F).\nAt this step, one more person is required to help in the modification of the lung to a metastatic model.\nGet silk 2-0 ready and use angular forceps to make a pass through the trachea at the bifurcation point.\nTie the trachea going to the right lung at the bifurcation point and check the free flow of media through the trachea to the left lung by passing culture media.\n\tNOTE: Once the trachea is tied at the bifurcation point, cells seeded through the trachea will automatically be directed to seed to the left lobes. It can be tested before seeding the cells by pushing culture media through the trachea. In the metastatic model, the media will move to the left lobes only, which will inflate, and not to the right lobes10.\nSet a 20 mL Luer lock syringe on top of the tracheal cannula and add ATCC lung cancer cells (A549, H1299) in 50 mL of RPMI1640 complete culture media (Figure 2F).\nPerform the cell seeding in the biosafety cabinet. Add 15 mL of cells in the syringe and let it pass through the lung lobes by gravity. Add the rest of the cells before any air bubbles pass through.\nIn acellular lung seeding, collect the perfused media dripping down in the bioreactor bottle and let it pass through the trachea again 3x.",
    "NOTE: The perfused media sometimes has the cancer cells seeded. Therefore, for efficient seeding, put back the media again in the trachea through the syringe.\nOnce seeded, remove the syringe, wait for 15 min, add fresh media, and return the bioreactor back to an incubator. Remove any air bubbles in the tubing.\nStart the pump to perfuse the media at 6 mL/min.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
