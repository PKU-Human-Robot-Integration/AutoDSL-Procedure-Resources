    "The clinical project was approved by the Medical Ethics Association of the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University (No. KY01-2020-06-06) and has been registered at the China Clinical Trial Registration Center (No. ChiCTR2000033449) and entitled \"The effects of masks on cardiopulmonary and lower limb function\".\n1. Participant recruitment\nInclude subjects between 18 and 26 years old: who can pass the PAR-Q test6; are physically healthy; without professional sports training experience; and able to understand the experiment and voluntarily cooperate with the whole test process.\nExclude subjects: with cardiovascular diseases and respiratory diseases; with lower limb motor dysfunction caused by other diseases; who cannot cooperate with the experiment; and smokers7.\nObtain written informed consent from each subject before their participation.\nInform the subject that strenuous activities are prohibited 48 h before the test and during the test, and that food and beverages (except water) are not allowed 2 h before the test.\nCollect the subjects' basic information (name, gender, date of birth, height, weight).\nRandomly allocate the subjects into two groups by SPSS generated digit table. Group 1 first received CPET in the mask-on condition followed by 48 h of washout, and then received CPET in the mask-off condition. Group 2 first received CPET in the mask-off condition followed by 48 h of washout, then received CPET in the mask-on condition.\n2. Laboratory settings and equipment preparation\nSet the laboratory temperature to 25 °C and equip with first aid equipment.\nCalibrate the cardiopulmonary function analyzer to ensure the accuracy of the CPET test, including flow sensor calibration, indoor air calibration, gas analysis calibration, and respiratory rate calibration.\n\t​NOTE: For gas analysis calibration, use 5% CO2 and 16% O2 concentrations and N2 for balance.\n3. Spirometry",
    "Ask the subject to sit upright without leaning on the back of the chair, with their feet on the ground, but without tilting their feet. Ask them to keep their head at a natural level or slightly tilted upwards, but not to bend their head down or bend over.\nForced Vital Capacity (FVC) test: Ask the subject to breathe calmly for 5 s, inhale strongly, and then exhale strongly for 6 s. Finally, inhale back and keep breathing calmly. Perform the whole procedure under the guidance of a doctor or a formally trained exercise physiologist.\nMaximum Voluntary Ventilation (MVV) test: Ask the subject to breathe calmly four or five times. Then repeat the breath continuously for 12 s or 15 s at the maximum breathing amplitude and the fastest breathing speed after the baseline with expiratory volume is stable (Figure 1).\n\t​NOTE: If the subject does not perform well during static lung function test, the subject will be asked to perform the tests one more time after a 3-min rest. If the subject fails the test twice, exclude the subject.\n4. Cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET)\nSubject preparation for CPET\n\t\nBriefly introduce the process to the subject.\nScrape the body hair at the position of the electrocardiograph (ECG) electrodes (V1 to V6), and then use 75% alcohol to remove extra dander and grease.",
    "​NOTE: V1 is the 4th intercostal space to the right of the sternum. V2 is the 4th intercostal space, to the left of the sternum, V3 is between V2 and V4 electrodes, V4 is the 5th intercostal space on the midclavicular line, V5 is the 5th intercostal space, on the anterior axillary line, and V6 is the 5th intercostal space on the left midaxillary line. Place limb electrodes for the arms in the sub-clavicular areas, and place limb electrodes for the legs placed on the trunk at the level of the bottom rib. The electrode placement should be lateral to avoid excessive movement artifact during cycling.\nPlace the ECG electrodes and attach them to the 12-lead ECG wires.\nFix the ECG machine to the chest using a strap (Figure 2).\nChoose a mask that fits the size of the subject's face and attach it firmly to the face to ensure that there is no gap between the mask and the face (Figure 3).\n\t\tNOTE: The tester could use their hand to press gently on the vest and lightly exhale to ensure that there is no gap.\nFix the flow meter on the vent and then fix the K4 device onto the vest (Figure 4).\nSit on the seat and adjust the height of the handlebars to a comfortable position for the subject.\nGrab the handlebar with both hands and step on the pedals with bilateral feet to ensure that the right knee joint bends with flexion at 30°.\nPlace a blood pressure cuff on the upper-right arm for dynamic blood pressure recording. Place a finger pulse oxygen on the left index finger for dynamic recording of blood oxygen.\nCalculate the subject's exercise resistance/increased incremental per min (W) parameters and set the progressive resistance plan for the exercise phase8.",
    "NOTE: Exercise resistance (male) = [(height - age) * 20 - (150 + 6 * weight)] / 100\n\t\tExercise resistance (female) = [(height - age) * 14 - (150 + 6 * weight)] / 100\nCPET executing phase\n\t​NOTE: Ask the subject not to speak during the whole procedure to prevent extra exhalation and inhalation during speaking, which might affect the accuracy of the cardiopulmonary data. Ask the subject to please raise their hand to indicate if there is any questions or discomfort that results in the test interruption.\n\t\nClick on the Start button to activate cycle ergometer by tester.\nKeep a static sitting posture for 2 min (Rest stage).\nStart cycling for 2 min (Warm-up stage: resistance to 0 W, speed to 60 rpm).\nContinue cycling until the time point when the subject could not maintain or show the ending signs (Ramp exercise stage: Incremental resistance, X watt resistance per min, 60 rpm).\n\t\t​NOTE: X watt resistance per min is based on the formulas in step 4.1.10.\nAsk the subject to cycle for 3 min (cool-down stage: resistance to 0 W, speed to 40 rpm).\nKeep the static sitting posture for 3 min for observation of vital signs (observation stage).",
    "​NOTE: Criteria for discontinuing are as follows: Subjects are encouraged to exercise to their maximum endurance or until the practitioners end the exercise due to symptoms such as ischemic ECG changes, complex ectopy, second or third degree heart block, fall in systolic pressure >20 mm Hg from the highest value during the test, hypertension (>250 mm Hg systolic; >120 mm Hg diastolic), severe desaturation (oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2) ≤ 80%), symptoms and signs of severe hypoxemia (sudden pallor, loss of coordination, mental confusion, dizziness, faintness), signs of respiratory failure, or exhaustion (Borg ≥ 17-18 points) failed maintaining the cycling speed (lower than 40 rpm). The test will be terminated immediately if the subjects show extreme verbal or physical fatigue7, which is lower than 40 rpm.\nRemove data acquisition equipment, face mask, vest, and ECG electrodes.\n5. CPET post testing\nUse the Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale to measure physical activity intensity levels that are apparently related to the heart rate (HR) during exercise9,10.\nUse the Borg's scale (6-20 scale) to evaluate exertion of resistance training 11. A score of 6 represents resting activity with no effort and a score of 20 represents exhaustive exercise.\n6. Statistical analysis\nAnalyze the data using SPSS software (version 25) and the methodology referenced in the previous study12.\nPresent the parametric data as mean and standard deviation (SD) if normally distributed or median if not.\nAllocate the subjects into male or female groups for statistical analysis, respectively.\nUse the paired t-test to compare the differences of CPET parameters between subjects in the mask-on condition and mask-off condition. Statistical significance is P < 0.05.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
