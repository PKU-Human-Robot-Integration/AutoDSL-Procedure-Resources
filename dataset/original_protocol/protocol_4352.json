  "procedures": [
    "Pre-heat water bath or incubator to 95 °C and pre-heat CDTA extraction buffer.   Collect plant tissue in tubes - we use leaf material from approx. 4 week old Arabidopsis thaliana plants. Three fully expanded Arabidopsis leaves weigh about 250 mg.   Freeze tubes containing the tissue in liquid nitrogen (tissue can be stored at -80 °C).   Pulverize frozen tissue using ball bearings and a paint shaker, mortar and pestle or a bead beater. The method used to pulverize tissue is not critical. Keep tissue frozen. If paint shaker is used three cycles of three minutes each are generally sufficient to pulverize tissue.   Add 1 ml of CDTA extraction buffer to 250 mg of frozen pulverized Arabidopsis tissue.   Place tubes at 95 °C. Use caution, the liquid will become very hot and lids may open; therefore use screw cap tubes or lid locks to secure lids.   Incubate for 15 min, vortex every 5 min.   Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 10 min at room temperature.   The supernatant contains the pectin.   Supernatant can be frozen and freeze dried for downstream applications."
