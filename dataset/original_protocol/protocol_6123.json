    "Synchronization of nematode population (Day 0) Synchronize a plate of young adult nematodes with eggs (about 500 animals) using standard hypochlorite approach (Stiernagle, 2006). Growth of nematode population (Days 1 to 3)Maintain synchronized cohort consisting about 500 larvae in a 94 mm NGM agar plate in a 20 °C incubator until they reached adulthood (the synchronized wild-type L1 animals will reach young adult stage in about 50 h at 20 °C). The day before transferring the young adult nematodes to the paraquat treatment plate, prepare the 10 mM paraquat treatment plate in advance by adding paraquat to the sterile NGM agar at 55 °C, and pour the NGM agar into a 94 mm plate and let the agar solidify. Seed the NGM agar plate with OP50-1 mixed with paraquat, dry the bacteria and keep the plate at 4 °C. Paraquat treatment (Day 3)Transfer half of the young adults (about 250 nematodes) to paraquat treatment plate.Pick worms for assay (Day 4) Pick the adult worms from control and treatment plates for oxygen measurement.Mitochondrial metabolic flux measurement Hydrate an XFe96 sensor cartridge (Day 3):Aliquot 20 ml of Seahorse XF Calibrant into a 50 ml centrifuge tube. Place the centrifuge tube containing 20 ml of Seahorse XF calibrant in a non-CO2 37 °C incubator. To hydrate the sensor cartridge of the XFe96 Extracellular Flux Assay Kit (Refer to Figure 1A)Remove the sensor cartridge from the utility plate and place the sensor cartridge upside down to make sure that the sensors do not contact with the surface of the lab bench. Add 200 μl of sterile water into each well of the utility plate.Lower the sensor cartridge onto the utility plate to submerge the sensors in water. Place the assembled sensor cartridge and utility plate in non-CO2 37 °C incubator overnight.",
    "If sensor cartridge is being hydrated more than 24 h, wrap parafilm around it to prevent evaporation. Hydrated sensor cartridge can be kept up to 72 h only. Turn on the XFe96 controller (computer), XFe96 analyzer and start the wave controller software. Make sure the heater for the instrument is off and let the machine stabilize at room temperature or lower temperature overnight. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190517/20190517005722_9092.jpgFigure 1. Seahorse XFe96 sensor cartridge. (A) Top green plate is the sensor cartridge and bottom transparent plate is the utility plate. (B) To load the compound, place the compound loading guide plate on top of the sensor cartridge submerged in the utility plate filled with XF calibrant. Directly pipette the compound into the desired column of the compound loading guide plate to load the compounds into the sensor cartridge. Switch to the B/C loading guide plate when loading injection Port B or C. Day of Assay (Day 4) Hydrate an XFe96 sensor cartridge (continue from Day 3)Remove the assembled sensor cartridge and the tube containing 20 ml of the aliquoted XF Calibrant from the incubator. Discard the water from the utility plate.Add 200 μl of the overnight per-warmed XF Calibrant into each well of the utility plate. Lower the sensor cartridge onto the utility plate to submerge the sensors in water. Place the assembled sensor cartridge and utility plate back to the non-CO2 37 °C incubator for 45 min.Preparation of drugs and loading of drugs into sensor cartridge injection portsDuring the 45 min incubation time, prepare the carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP) and sodium azide to be loaded into the drug ports. The FCCP and sodium azide concentrations have been optimized as stated in Fong et al. (2017). Prepare a 2.5 mM stock of FCCP in 100% DMSO.",
    "Prepare 500 μl of FCCP dilution in M9 buffer to 90 μM. Refer to Table 1 for FCCP stock concentration and dilutions.Table 1. FCCP stock and final concentrationimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190517/20190517012319_5401.jpgPrepare 5 M stock of sodium azide in MilliQ-H2O.Prepare 500 μl of sodium azide dilution in MilliQ-H2O to 500 mM. Refer to Table 2 for sodium azide stock concentration and dilutions.Table 2. Sodium azide stock and final concentrationimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190517/20190517012401_7205.jpgAfter 45 min, load the compounds into the injection ports by using the A/D and B/C compound loading guide plates to dispense the compound into the injection port of the hydrated cartridge to prevent cross-contamination of compounds. To load 25 μl of 90 μM FCCP into injection port A, place the A/D compound loading guide plate on top of the hydrate sensor cartridge. Make sure the letter A on the compound loading guide plate is located in the top left-hand corner. Use your thumb and index finger to hold the loading guide plate to secure it during loading so that the pipette tips do not dislodge from the loading guide plate. Refer to Figures 1B and 2 for the compound loading guide plates and the layout of the drug injection ports, respectively.Similarly, use B/C compound loading guide plate to load 25 μl of 500 mM Sodium Azide into injection port B. Refer to Figures 1B and 2 for the compound loading guide plates and the layout of the drug injection ports, respectively.Load the hydrated cartridge with 25 μl of 90 μM FCCP into port A and 25 μl of 500 mM Sodium Azide into Port B. Do not load the drugs into port A or B for well A1, A12, H1 and H12. Refer to Figures 1B and 2 for the compound loading guide plates and the layout of the drug injection ports, respectively.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190517/20190517005827_8299.jpgFigure 2.",
    "Layout of the drug injection ports in the XF sensor cartridgeNotes: Ports A and B must be filled with the same volume of drugs or buffer. Ports C and D that are not in use can be kept empty.  Avoid creating air bubbles in the injection ports.  Do not tap the cartridge after loading the compounds to the injection ports as this will cause compound leakage from the injection port.Load 25 μl of M9 buffer into Port A of well A1, A12, H1 and H12 and 25 μl of MilliQ H2O into Port B of well A1, A12, H1 and H12. Well A1, A12, H1 and H12 are blank wells used for background correction. Place the hydrated cartridge onto the utility plate filled with XF calibrant. Set up the protocol using the “Wave controller” software.Carefully load the hydrated cartridge filled with compounds to the XFe96 seahorse analyzer. Start the protocol to calibrate the hydrated sensor cartridge (approximately 40-50 min of calibration time).Transferring of C. elegans During the calibration time, pipette 200 μl of M9 buffer into each well of a fresh utility plate. Transfer 10 worms using worm pick into each well. The experiment must be done with at least 6 replicates for each condition. For each plate, include 6 wells with the same amount of OP50 (food for worms) only. This serves as the control to measure baseline OCR derived from bacteria inside the worm gut.Refer to Figure 3 for plate layout below for the design of our experiment using N2 and N2 treated with 10 mM Paraquat.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190517/20190517005856_8325.jpgFigure 3.",
    "Plate layout for the design of our experiment using N2 and N2 treated with 10 mM ParaquatRunning the seahorse XF assayOnce the sensor cartridge calibration is completed, remove the calibration plate and replace with the utility plate containing worms in 200 μl of M9 buffer. Remove the lid of the utility plate and place the plate into the XFe96 analyzer. Start the equilibration. After completing the equilibration, the assay will automatically begin to acquire baseline measurement according to the protocol that has been set earlier. Use the protocol below to measure the mitochondrial respiration in C. elegans.
