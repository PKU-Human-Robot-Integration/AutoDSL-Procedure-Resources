    "NOTE: This protocol follows the guidelines of the local human research ethics committee.\n1. General Considerations\nNOTE: General considerations regarding equipment, data storage and safety are addressed in the Discussion.\nObtain images using a high-resolution, real-time, mobile 2D ultrasound machine with multiple transducers with a band of frequencies (see Discussion). Typically, obtain images of good quality using a probe with a frequency of 7.5 to 8.5 MHz.\n2. Preparation of the CUS Exam\nSchedule the CUS examination so that it does not coincide with other procedures such as blood sampling.\nEnsure that a health care worker or a parent is available to support and/or comfort the neonate during the examination, using strategies such as those according to the principles of Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program6.\n3. Examination Through Anterior Fontanel\nInstall the ultrasound machine along the incubator or cot.\nApply transducer gel to the probe to ensure good contact between the probe and the skin. Consider warming the gel before use.\nStart imaging through the anterior fontanel with a convex probe in B-mode. Place the probe in the middle of the fontanel with the marker on the probe turned to the right side of the neonate. The left side of the brain will then be displayed on the right side of the monitor.\n\tNOTE: Imaging through the anterior fontanel can be performed with the neonate in any position3. For research purposes it may be necessary to strive for a standard head position.\n\t\nRecord images in at least five coronal and five sagittal planes. In the first image adjust depth, gain and time gain compensation settings to produce an image filling the sector, containing the cranial contours, avoiding too bright or dark images and aiming for an equilibrium between reflections from nearby and deeper structures.\nCoronal planes",
    "NOTE: Try to obtain perfectly symmetrical images. When lesions near the frontal lobe convexity are suspected, consider recording specific oblique coronal sections, so that one hemisphere is displayed in better detail (Figure 1).\n\t\t\nFor the coronal prefrontal image, angle the probe forwards to visualize the frontal lobes, anterior to the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles at the level of the olfactory sulci.\nFor the coronal image at the level of Monro, angle the probe to visualize the coronal section anterior to the tela choroidea to depict the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles, cavum septi pellucidi, corpus callosum, sulcus cinguli. Note the echogenicity of parts of the basal ganglia.\nFor the coronal image at the level of thalamus, angle the probe backwards to identify the lateral fissures, tela choroidea in the roof of the third ventricle and temporal lobes. Note the echogenicity of the thalamus (especially ventrolateral nuclei) in relation to the basal ganglia. Note that network injury in pulvinar may be visualized in an extra coronal section just in front of the atria.\nFor the coronal image at the level of atria, visualize the lateral ventricles at the level of the choroid plexus. Identify the temporal lobes and cerebellar hemispheres. Note the echogenicity of periventricular white matter compared to choroid plexus. Compare optic radiation with the normal hyperechoic areas above and lateral to the atria in preterm neonates.\nFor the coronal parieto-occipital image, angle the probe backwards to the level of the parieto-occipital sulcus to identify the parietal and occipital lobes.\nSagittal planes\n\t\t\nRotate the probe 90° with the marker on the probe facing towards the neonate’s face. The anterior part of the brain will be displayed on the left side of the monitor. Record images at the level of the following structures (Figure 2).",
    "For the midsagittal image, visualize the corpus callosum, cavum septi pellucidi (CSP), third and fourth ventricle, vermis, cisterna magna, pons and mesencephalon. Note the presence of cavum Vergae and cavum veli interpositi7.\nFor the parasagittal image through one gangliothalamic ovoid (e.g., the right), angle the probe sideways for a parasagittal view through the lateral ventricle. Identify the choroid plexus and note the echogenicity of thalamus and basal ganglia. The scanned side for parasagittal planes should be appropriately indicated with text tools.\nFor the parasagittal insular image, angle the probe further lateral through the insula. Identify the lateral fissure and frontal-, temporal-, parietal- and occipital lobes.\nRepeat parasagittal images for the contralateral side (i.e., the left).\nColor Doppler\n\t\t\nContinue imaging through the anterior fontanel with a convex probe using color Doppler. Consider evaluating flow velocities in cerebral arteries and veins and obtaining derived indices.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Resistive index (RI) is defined as peak systolic velocity – end diastolic velocity / peak systolic velocity. RI is angle-independent, absolute velocity values are not8-10. RI is not similar in arteries of different caliber. Serial measurements are only useful if performed in the exact same location of the same vessel.\nRecord images in coronal planes of the following vessels (Figure 3):\n\t\t\nVisualize the transverse sinuses at the level of the cerebellum. If only one or none the transverse sinuses is visualized, try lowering the pulse repetition frequency (PRF). If then still only one or none of the transverse sinuses can be identified through the anterior fontanel, use a high frequency linear probe for visualization through the mastoid fontanel (see section 4.4.2).",
    "Visualize the circle of Willis with internal carotid arteries, middle cerebral arteries and anterior cerebral arteries at the level of the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles. Distinguishing the left and right anterior cerebral arteries is often challenging, but is usually unnecessary. Identify the striatal candelabra of arteries.\nAngle the probe backwards to visualize the basilar artery with adjacent jugular veins.\nAngle even more backwards to visualize the internal cerebral and thalamostriate veins.\nRecord an image in the sagittal plane of one anterior cerebral artery (Figure 4). Assess flow velocity and RI at a specific part of this vessel (usually below the genu of the corpus callosum). Near the midline velocities in the internal cerebral vein can be readily measured.\nUsing a high frequency linear probe in a coronal plane in the anterior fontanel, identify the superior sagittal sinus. If this should fail, reduce the amount of pressure applied with the probe to the fontanel.\n\t\tNOTE: The linear probe can be used for detailed visualization of superficial structures (meninges, arachnoid and subdural space, cortex). Tangential vessels are in the subarachnoid space. Ideally, Doppler imaging as described in the previous steps will be performed during the first CUS examination of the neonate. During follow-up examination some of the steps may be skipped. In case of suspected cerebral sinovenous thrombosis Doppler imaging as described in steps 3.3.5.1, 3.3.7 and 4.4.2 should be performed.\n4. Examination Through Alternative Acoustic Windows\nNext, continue examination through alternative acoustic windows.\nConsider recording images through the lambdoid (posterior) fontanel using a convex probe (Figure 5). The posterior fontanel is located at the junction of the sagittal and lambdoid sutures3,11. Image through the posterior fontanel by placing the neonate in the lateral decubitus position.",
    "NOTE: In many premature infants satisfactory images may also be obtained through the posterior aspect of the sagittal suture with the infant in a supine position3.\n\t\nPosition the probe in the middle of the posterior fontanel for a sagittal view. Angle the probe slightly off midline to identify the body of the lateral ventricle and its occipital horn. Turn the probe roughly 90° to obtain a coronal view. Identify the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles.\nConsider recording images through the lateral (temporal) window using a convex or linear probe above the ear (Figure 6).\n\t\nIf necessary, obtain images through the lateral window to allow a detailed view of the brainstem12. Place the probe horizontally above and slightly in front of the ear. Move the probe until the cerebral peduncles are visualized.\n\t\tNOTE: Other structures that can be identified are the third ventricle, aqueduct and temporal lobes. Using color Doppler, the circle of Willis can be visualized.\nRecord images through the mastoid fontanel (Figure 7). The mastoid fontanel is located behind the ear, at the junction of the temporal, parietal and occipital bones4. Image through the mastoid fontanel by placing the neonate in a lateral decubitus position3.\n\tNOTE: In our experience, neonates often show signs of discomfort when images through the mastoid fontanel are obtained. Therefore, it would be best to do this after imaging through the anterior fontanel and other acoustic windows. We hypothesize that this discomfort could be caused by the mechanism of auditory response to pulses of radiofrequency energy13.",
    "Image through mastoid fontanel using a convex probe. Place the probe parallel to the ear to obtain a coronal view. Sweep the probe back and forth to identify the cerebellar hemispheres, vermis, third and fourth ventricle, pons and cisterna magna. In small preterms the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere may be well depicted.\nImage through mastoid fontanel using a linear probe. If (one of) the transverse sinuses cannot be identified through the anterior fontanel, use a high frequency linear probe for visualization through the mastoid fontanel. Place the probe parallel to the ear lobe to obtain a coronal view.\n\t\t\nIdentify the cerebellar hemisphere and fourth ventricle. Using color Doppler, identify the transverse and sigmoid sinus, tentorial sinus and emissary veins.\nConsider additional visualization of the posterior fossa through foramen magnum14.\nSubscription Required.
