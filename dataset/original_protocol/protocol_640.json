    "**Fixation**\nFixative: 3.7% formaldehyde, in Sea water \\(make up fresh)\n1. Starve Adults for two days. Fix hatchlings on the same day they hatched.\n  2. Relax adults and juveniles in 7.14% MgCl<sub>2</sub> up to 10 min \n  3. Fix animals in 3.7% formaldehyde only for 4 hours at 4&#xB0;C. \n  5. Wash 5x in PTw, 1x in dH<sub>2</sub>O, and transfer to fresh 100% MeOH\n  6.  Replace MeOH 2x, store at -20&#xB0;C in a screw cap tube\n  \n**_In situ_ hybridization**\nUse RNAse-free equipment and solutions through hybridization step. All washes are 5 min. at RT on rocker table unless otherwise stated.\n**DAY 1**\n**Pretreatment**\n1. Transfer embryos to a 24 well dish and use 500&#x3BC;l for each wash.\n   \n2. Rehydrate through: 60% MeOH/40% PTw, 30% MeOH/70%, PTw 4 x PTw  washes\n  \n3. Digest with Proteinase-K \\(0.01 mg/ml in PTw &#x2013; make fresh) for 2-3 minutes \\(no shaker). \\(Use 4 &#xB5;l of a 20 mg/ml stock in 8 ml)\n  \n4. Stop digestion with 2 \\(PTw + 2 mg/ml glycine) washes.\n  \n5. Wash with 1% triethanolamine in PTw \n  \n6. Add 1.5 &#x3BC;l acetic anhydride to 500 &#xB5;l 1% triethanolamine, Vortex it an put on the probe for 5 minutes.\n  \n7.  Take the solution, add 1.5 &#x3BC;l more acetic anhydride, vortex again and put it again on the probe. \n  \n8. Wash briefly in Ptw, then wash 2 x 5 min in PTw\n   \n9. Refix in 3.7% formaldehyde in PTw for 1 hour at RT.\n  10. Wash 5 x in PTw\n  \n11. Heat animals for 10 min at 80&#xB0;C to destroy endogenous phosphatases\n  \n**Prehybridization**\n12. Remove as much liquid as possible without letting the embryos falling dry, and add 500 &#x3BC;l hybe buffer B - incubate for 10 minutes at RT.\n  \n13. Remove liquid - add 500 &#x3BC;l hybe buffer. Place at hybe temp overnight",
    "14. Wash embryos once with prewarmed Hybe to get rid of traces of the dissolved egg cluster jelly\n  \n**Hybridisation**\n15. Dilute probe to a final concentration of 3-0.05 ng/&#x3BC;l \\(usually 2.0 ng/&#x3BC;l) in hybe solution \\(dig-labeled probe should be stored as a 50 ng/&#x3BC;l stock in hybe buffer at -20 degrees). Denature probe at 80-90&#xB0;C max for 10 minutes. \n  \n16. Remove prehybe and add probe to each well. Hybridize overnight or the weekend.\n  \n**DAY 2**\n17. Remove Probe \\(can be reused 4-5 times)\n   \n18. Wash 1 x for 10 minutes and 1 x for 40 minutes with hybe buffer at hybe temp. \\(Do not forget to prewarm hybe buffer)\n  \n19. Wash usung the following steps:\n   - 30 min in 75% hybe + 25% 2X SSC at hybe temp\n - 30 min in 50% hybe + 50% 2X SSC at hybe temp\n -  30 min in 25% hybe + 75% 2X SSC at hybe temp\n - 30 min in 100% 2X SSC at hybe temp\n - 3 x 20 min in 0.2X SSC at hybe temp\n - 10 min in 75% 0.2X SSC + 25% PTw at RT\n - 10 min in 50% 0.2X SSC + 50% PTw at RT\n -  10 min in 25% 0.2X SSC + 75% PTw at RT\n20. 10 min in 100% PTw at RT\n  \n**Visualization of Probe**\n21. Wash 3 x with PBT at RT\n  \n22. Block in Boehringer-Mannheim Blocking buffer \\(diluted to 1x with maleic acid buffer) 1 hr at RT on rocker.\n  23. Incubate with Boehringer-Mannheim anti-Dig/AP \\(diluted in blocking buffer to 1:5000) at 4&#xB0;C overnight on rocker.\n  \n**DAY3**\n24. Wash 10x \\(or more) for 20-30 minutes in PBT.  \n  25. Wash 3 x for 10 minutes in AP buffer \\(embryos tend to stick a lot).",
    "26. Develop in AP substrate solution \\(make fresh) at RT in dark. Monitor color development. \\(Can also develop slower at 4 degrees)\n  27. Stop reaction by washing 5 x with PTw."
