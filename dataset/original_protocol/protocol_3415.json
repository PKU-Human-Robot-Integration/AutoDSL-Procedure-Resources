The grid is used as a fiducial marker to identify the injection target. The purpose of this step is to install the grid holder in the proper position of the skull.\nAnesthetize the experimental monkey.\nAdminister the subject monkey with atropine (0.02–0.05 mL/kg) to decrease bronchial secretions before anesthetization.\nAnesthetized by ketamine (10 mg/kg) or Zoletil (5 mg/kg), followed by isoflurane to maintain anesthesia\nKeep monitoring the physiological indicators including SpO2, heart rate, respiration rate, blood pressure, and temperature during anesthesia.\nNote: This procedure is performed by veterinarians.\nFix the monkey on the stereotaxic frame (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3180-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. The stereotaxic frame and the 3D manipulator\nNote: It’s better to use ophthalmic ointment to protect the eyes from drying and abrasion.\nCritical: Ensure the head of the monkey is located in the middle of the stereotaxic frame by checking the scales of the ear bar on the left and right sides are equal.\nDisinfect the head skin of the monkey and the stereotaxic frame.\nShave all hairs off the monkey’s head.\nUse iodophor and ethanol (70% or 95%) alternately to scrub the head skin and the stereotaxic frame multiple times (>3) to ensure effective disinfection.\nClean your hands with a surgical scrub brush, and then put on a sterile surgical gown and surgical gloves.\nPlace a sterile drape over the monkey and the operating table, and then have the required instruments ready in the proper position.\nInstall the 3D manipulator.\nInstall the 3D manipulator on one side of the stereotaxic frame according to the position of the target area.",
    "Put a locating rod on the manipulator, which helps to read the coordinates by pointing the tip at a given place (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nIdentify the appropriate location of the injection site on the skull using the manipulator and the locating rod according to the coordinates of target injection site on 3D manipulator.\nNote: Refer to a monkey atlas to get the appropriate coordinates.\nIdentify the appropriate install position for the grid holder.\nAdjust the angle and orientation of grid holder to find the position where the curvature fits the holder best; meanwhile, keep the grid on the appropriate location.\nNote: It does not need to be accurate at this step, because the final position will be determined at step 10 after the skull is exposed.\nExpose the skull surface at the site for grid holder installation using scalpels.\nPlace the grid holder (with the grid on) on the skull.\nWhile ensuring the grid sits right above the target area, adjust the angle and orientation of the holder to find the best location for installation (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3180-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Install the grid holder on the skull\n(A) Localize the best location for installing the grid.\n(B) Secure the grid holder with ceramic screws.\n(C) Fix the grid holder and screws with dental cement.\n(D) Remove the grid and sew up the skin.\nUse the flat end of the locating rod to ensure the top surface of the grid is horizontal.\nSecure the grid holder with ceramic screws (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nDrill three holes using drills and taps of proper size and install the screws firmly.",
    "Note: We normally use three screws to fix the grid holder. Two for the screw holes on the grid holder, and the third installed adjacent to it, working as an anchor to reinforce the holder after coating it with dental cement.\nFix the grid holder with dental cement (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nAdjust the tightness of the screws to make sure the grid is horizontal (with the assistance of the locating rod).\nUse a syringe to deliver dental cement to cover all ceramic screws and the base of the grid holder.\nCritical: Be cautious to keep the bottom of the grid free of cement.\nRemove the grid from the holder and sew up the scalp to cover the cement base, only exposing the top of the grid holder (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D).\nPart 2: MRI scan\nTiming: ∼1 h\nFollowing the installation of the grid, the next step is to have the monkey undergo an MRI scan with the guiding grid, which aims to identify the precise target and trajectory for virus injection. We recommend performing the scan right after the grid installation on the same day.\nPrepare the experimental monkey.\nThe monkey can be transferred to the MRI scan right after the grid installation keeping anesthetization.\nNote: In case extra recovery time is required, to prepare for an MRI scan, the monkeys must undergo the anesthetizing procedure again following the standard protocol.\nFill the grid with a contrast agent.\nThe grid works as a fiducial marker in the MRI images. Therefore, a contrast agent must be filled in the holes in the grid to make them visible in the MRI images. Commonly used contrast agents under T1 structural images include Vitamin E, Vitamin D, and fish oil.\nEnsure the holes in the grid are not stuck.",
    "Use a piece of tape to cover the bottom to prevent leaking of contrast agent.\nNote: Since the holes in the grid we use are interpenetrated, we use a piece of tape to cover the bottom of the grid to prevent the leaking of the contrast agent. One may also design a grid with a blocked bottom to hold fluid.\nUse a syringe to inject the contrast agent into the holes. Alternatively, fill the contrast agent in glass tubes that fit the holes in advance, and then insert the tubes into the holes.\nNote: It is technically not required to fill in all the holes, but the holes at the fringe and the center of the grid should be filled.\nMRI scan.\nFix the monkey on the MRI-compatible stereotaxic frame, and then install the grid filled with contrast agent in advance on the pre-implanted holder.\nPut on the head coil. Some types of head coil may touch the grid or may be unable to sit on the usual place and lose some quality of signal. Try to adjust the placement of the head coil to generate the best imaging quality.\nEnsure the monkey is in good status for the MRI scan by checking the heart rate, SpO2, etc.\nStart the scan using a sequence for brain structure. A 0.5 mm isotropic resolution T1-weighted imaging is recommended.\nCheck the status of the monkey immediately after the scan is completed.\nCritical: Ensure that the monkey cannot make any movement during the scan. Otherwise, the scan quality may be affected. Usually, this should not be an issue if proper anesthesia procedures are applied. In case motion is detected, scan the animal again after adjusting anesthesia states.\nPart 3: Pre-injection localization\nTiming: 1–2 h",
    "After obtaining the structural images, pre-operation localization must be performed before the injection. This step can be done any time between the MRI scan and the virus injection. A monkey atlas is strongly recommended while doing this planning. This step aims to identify the precise target and the optimal injection trajectory based on the MRI results.\nLoad the MRI images into a viewing software. We recommend using “3D slicer” as it is open-access and free of charge (www.slicer.org[href=http://www.slicer.org]).\nAdjust the image to ensure the grid can be seen clearly in all dimensions.\nAlign the coronal axis and the sagittal axis with the holes in the grid (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3180-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Offline identification of the coordinates of the target region\nThe horizontal coordinates can be obtained from the horizontal view of the grid (left), and the depth of the target can be obtained by measuring the distance between the target and the skull surface (right).\nCalculate the coordinates of the target injection site.\nUse the coordinates in the atlas to locate the appropriate position of the target. Try to avoid blood vessels while planning injection paths.\nAfter the exact location is identified, use a specific grid hole as a reference to calculate the coordinates of the target. For example, in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], the hole indicated by the crossline serves as the origin. If the target site is right below the origin, then the coordinates for x- and y-axes are (0,0). For a target 1 mm to the right of the origin, its coordinates are (1,0).\nAs to the depth, we recommend setting the point at the surface of the skull as zero when calculating the depth (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). These coordinates will then be used for virus injection.",
    "Note: The atlas we refer to is “A Combined MRI and Histology Atlas of the Rhesus Monkey Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates,” which is a classic textbook in the field of primate neuroscience.13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]\nPart 4: Virus injection\nTiming: 3–6 h\nThis section introduces the detailed process for virus injection. We normally allow the monkey to recover for 2–3 days after MRI scan.\nAnesthetize the experimental monkey following the procedure described above (Step 1).\nUnfrozen the virus by placing it in ice.\nFix the monkey on the stereotaxic frame (see Step 2).\nDisinfect the scalp of the experimental monkey and the stereotaxic frame following the steps described in Step 3.\nClean your hands with a surgical scrub brush, and then put on a sterile surgical gown and surgical gloves. Place a sterile drape over the monkey and the operating table, and then have the required instruments ready in the proper position.\nInstall the 3D manipulator. Mount the locating rod on the manipulator with its flat end pointing downward.\nInstall the grid on the grid holder. Check if the surface of the grid is horizontal using the flat end of the locating rod.\nNote: Clean and sterilize the grid before the installation on the grid holder. The grid used in this step needs to be clean and sterilized without any contrast agent.\nRemove the grid and expose the area underneath.\nAssemble the microinjection pump (including the pump controller) and load the injection syringe (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]). Locate the injection target using the grid-based coordinates.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3180-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Assembled microinjection pump, microinjection syringe, and the 3D manipulator\nMount the injection pump on the 3D manipulator.\nInstall the syringe on the pump.",
    "Adjust the 3D manipulator and use the needle tip of the syringe to locate the target position obtained from Part 3 (see also Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). First, find the reference hole, and then move the needle to the desired coordinates (if the target position is not located at the reference hole).\nLower the needle until it touches the skull. Make a marker on the skull at that point.\nCritical: Make sure the injection needle is not blocked if it touches blood.\nDrill a hole at the marker point on the skull for the microinjection entry.\nRemove the grid from the holder.\nUse an electric drill to make one small hole through the skull at the marker point.\nVerify the hole is drilled at the desired position by lowering the needle to penetrate through.\nCritical: Please be careful when using the electric drill. Try your best not to damage the dura or brain tissue. It is recommended to punch the dura with an extra sharp needle.\nUse the withdraw mode of the microinjection pump to fill the microsyringe with the virus. The speed of withdrawal can be set at 1–4 μL/min depending on the size of the syringe and the total amount of virus needed.\nCritical: At the end of the process, ensure that the amount of virus in the microsyringe matches the anticipated quantity.\nStart virus injection.\nLower the needle until the tip reaches the surface of the skull and set that point as the origin of the Z-axis. Keep lowering the needle until the tip reaches the target depth according to the coordinates obtained in Part 3.",
    "After reaching the target position, keep the needle still and wait for 5–10 min to allow the tissue to rebound. While lowering the needle, the tissue may be deformed by pressure and may need extra time to recover.\nStart to infuse virus. The infusion speed we normally use is 200–300 nL/min.\nAfter the infusion is done, wait for another 5–10 min to allow virus diffusion before retracting the syringe.\nRetract the needle or move to the next injection site. If multiple sites are required during one penetration, we normally start injecting from the deepest site.\nNote: It is necessary to wait for 5–10 min after the needle reaches the target position because the tissue may be deformed by pressure in the process of lowering the needle and may need extra time to recover.\nAfter finishing all injections, remove the grid holder from the skull after removing dental cement using an electric drill. We recommend using bone wax to fill the injection holes and screw holes in the skull.\nClean the skull surface using diluted iodophor (10%) and saline before finally sewing up the scalp. Apply some lidocaine gel on the wound after the suture is recommended to relieve local pain."
