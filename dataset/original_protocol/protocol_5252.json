    "Resin preparationWeigh 303 mg Rink-Amide resin (0.20 mmol equivalent) into a reaction vessel with filters and connect the up and down outlets to the solvent line and the waste line respectively.Add 8.0 ml DMF to the resin (washing step), stir gently for 5 min and then remove the solvent via nitrogen pressure (4- 8 psi). Repeat 3 times.Deprotection/coupling cycleAdd 8.0 ml of 20% piperidine/DMF (vol/vol), stir gently for 1 min (first Fmoc removal step), and then remove the solvent by nitrogen pressure.Add 8.0 ml of 20% piperidine/DMF (vol/vol), stir gently for 10 min (second Fmoc removal step), and then remove the solvent by nitrogen pressure.Add 8.0 ml DMF (washing step 1), shake for 30 sec, and then remove the solvent by nitrogen pressure.Add 8.0 ml DMF (washing step 2), shake for 5 min, and remove the solvent by nitrogen pressure.Repeat Step 4 four times.Dissolve 1.0 mmol Fmoc protected amino acid and HBTU (341.37 mg, 0.9 mmol) in 8.0 ml DMF. Mix well by bubbling nitrogen for 30 sec.Add 2.0 mmol DIEA (1 M, 2 ml) and bubbling nitrogen for 30 sec and wait for 5 min. Add the mixture to resin. Shake for 1 h. and then remove the solvent by nitrogen pressure filtration.(CRITICAL STEP: Intermittent stirring is preferred over continuous stirring when doing manual synthesis because of the fragility of some resin, in order to minimize the fragmentation of the resin in small-sized particles which can lead to difficulties during filtration. As an alternative, continuous gentle shaking or nitrogen bubbling through the reaction vessel can be applied).Repeat steps 6 and 7 for double coupling (optional).Add 8.0 ml DMF (washing step), stir for 30 sec and remove the solvent by nitrogen pressure filtration.Repeat Step 10 three times.",
    "Repeat the cycle starting from step 3 going to step 12 for each of the subsequent amino acids according to the peptide sequence using the above Fmoc-amino acid derivatives. CRITICAL STEP: The progress of the synthesis can be followed at every cycle by using microcleavage test (see below). To speed up the assembly, single couplings can be performed instead of double couplings).The requirement for the repetition of the coupling step can be derived from the result of the Kaiser test (see below).PAUSE POINT: the synthesis can, in principle, be interrupted at the end of every coupling cycle, when the N-terminal amino group is protected. To avoid undesired removal of the Fmoc group during storage in DMF, wash the peptide-resin five times with DCM and let it dry at room temperature (18-22 °C). Close the syringe with its plunger and cap, and store at 4 °C. Before resuming the synthesis, let the sample reach room temperature, and swell the dry resin as described in step 2.Removal of the N-terminal Fmoc-group and drying of the peptide resinAdd 8.0 ml of 20% piperidine/DMF (vol/vol), stir gently for 1 min (first Fmoc removal step), and then remove the solvent by nitrogen pressure filtration.Add 8.0 ml of 20% piperidine/DMF (vol/vol), stir gently for 10 min (second Fmoc removal step), and then remove the solvent by nitrogen pressure filtration.Add 8.0 ml DMF (washing Step 1), stir for 30 sec, remove the solvent by vacuum filtration.Add 8.0 ml DMF (washing step 2), stir for 5 min, remove the solvent by nitrogen pressure filtration.Repeat step 5 four times with DMF.Wash the resin four times with DCM in a glass filter.Air-dry the peptide resin.Peptide cleavage and purification (manually)Peptide cleavage and deprotection were carried out by a 3 h incubation in a mixture of TFA/TIS/EDT/H2O (94:2:2:2).",
    "The mixture was filtered, and the peptide in solution was precipitated with ice cold anhydrous diethyl ether and centrifuged in eppendorf swing bucket at speed of 1,000 rcf. The resulting peptide was washed four times with ice-cold anhydrous diethyl ether, dried, and dissolved in suitable buffer or solvent (add 1 mM DTT if there is a cysteine).The peptide was purified by RP-HPLC on a C-18 column. Fractions were collected and lyophilized. The target product was characterized by ESI-MS and was ready for use in the next step in the reaction."
