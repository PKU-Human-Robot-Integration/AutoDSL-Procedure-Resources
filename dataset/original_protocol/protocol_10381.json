    "The following protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Board at Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital.\n1. Motor Calibration\nConnect the microcontroller board to the computer using an USB port.\nUsing the original microcontroller software, upload the custom script, \"Motor_and_AccelerometerTest.ino\" to the board using the USB connection by clicking the \"Upload\" icon, denoted by the circled right arrow.\n\t\nEnsure that the vibration level is set to zero to put the motor in the off-position using the \"analogWrite\" command. The code should read \"analogWrite(vibe1,0);\".\nIn the microcontroller code, specify the pulse-width modulated (PWM) output pin corresponding to the motor of interest by initializing the \"vibe1\" variable.\n\t\tNote: PWM signals generate approximate analog outputs from the digital signals generated by the microcontroller. The pins are labeled numerically on the physical microcontroller board. For example, if the motor is connected to PWM output pin '3', then ensure that the \"int vibe1 = 3;\" is specified in the code.\nConnect the z-axis output of the tri-axis accelerometer to one of the analog input ports of the microcontroller board, and connect the positive and ground leads from the accelerometer to the 5V and ground (GND) ports of the microcontroller board, respectively.\nMount the accelerometer to the vibrating motor, ensuring that its z-axis is orthogonal to the flat surface of the motor, as shown in Figure 2, and place the motor on a hard surface.\nOpen the \"Motor_Calibration.vi\" file in the data acquisition software and connect the microcontroller to the computer through an USB port.\nUsing the fields provided, specify the serial port for the microcontroller input, using the dropdown menu, as well as the sampling rate, and number of samples to collect. Note: 500 Hz sampling rate is standard for these experiments to prevent aliasing of the acceleration data, and 1,000 samples are commonly recorded.",
    "Using the \"Motor_and_Accelerometer.ino\" code, specify the desired duty cycle of the PWM pulses supplied to the vibratory motor, once again using the \"analogWrite\" command, and re-download the program to the microcontroller board controlling the motors (see Step 1.1). For example, to set the number of pulses to 100, the code should read \"analogWrite(vibe1,100);\". Table 1 lists the PWM values and their corresponding duty cycles.\nUsing the Fast-Fourier Transform (FFT) display on the \"MotorCalibration.vi\" interface, identify the largest peak and record the corresponding vibration frequency value (from the horizontal axis).\nRepeat Steps 1.7-1.8, adjusting the PWM levels until the desired frequency is reached, recording each PWM-frequency pair. For example, if targeting a 100 Hz frequency, perform Steps 1.7-1.8 until the largest peak occurs over the 100 Hz mark on the horizontal axis.\n\tNote: For the vibrational motors used in this protocol, the targeted vibrations should lie in the 60-400 Hz range to better match the response frequencies of the mechanoreceptors in the skin described in the literature5,10,13.\nRepeat Steps 1.2.2 to 1.8 for each motor, manually recording the PWM-frequency relationship for each motor with a spreadsheet or pencil and paper.\nOpen the \"Experiment_1.vi\" file. For each motor, right-click on the dropdown frequency menu and select \"Property\". Under the \"Edit Items\" tab, use the table to enter the desired frequencies and corresponding PWM levels determined in Steps 1.8-1.9. Select \"OK\" to exit.\nRepeat Step 1.11 for each virtual interface (VI) file of the system design software to be used during testing (e.g., \"Experiment_2.vi\", \"Experiment_3.vi\", etc.).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54223/54223fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2. Accelerometer Mounted to Motor. The tri-axis accelerometer (green) is mounted to the coin motor with its z-axis orthogonal to the flat surface of the motor for calibration. Each motor was activated using different duty cycles, and the corresponding vibration frequencies were recorded by the accelerometer.

Placing the Motors\nOnce all motors have been calibrated (section 2), mount them to the thigh.\n\t\nTo achieve the results described in this manuscript, place the one motor on each of the anterior, posterior, medial, and lateral surfaces of the thigh, approximately midway between the greater trochanter and lateral femoral condyle (or distal end of the limb for above-knee amputees).\n\t\tNote: The specific locations of each motor can vary, depending on the research questions and regions of interest, and can be affected by anatomical and physiological factors, such as the type and spatial distribution of mechanoreceptors in the skin.\nAttach motors directly to the skin using double-sided tape.\n\tNote: Shaving the region around each motor is not necessary, but may improve their adhesion to the skin (Figure 3). For applications where the effects of clothing, a prosthetic liner, or some other material on user perception are of interest, place the motors on top of said material, rather than against the skin.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54223/54223fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Test Platform for Experiments. A custom test platform was built to house the microcontroller boards and push buttons. Motors can be attached directly to the skin (as shown), or with a prosthetic liner between the motor and skin.

    "Re-flash the microcontroller board with the firmware to enable control of the board through the data acquisition software by opening the \"LVIFA_Base.pde\" file with the controller's accompanying software package, and repeating Step 1.1, replacing \"Motor_and_Accelerometer_Test.ino\" with the \"LVIFA_Base.pde\" script.\nConnect the push-button directly to one of the computer's USB ports using a serial-to-USB connector. Ensure that all required drivers are installed.\nOpen the \"Experiment_1.vi\" interface.\nSpecify the serial ports for the microcontroller board connected to the motors, and push-button by selecting the corresponding serial port identification numbers from the dropdown menus labeled \"Motor Input\" and \"Green Button\", respectively. Identify the serial port identification numbers using the computer's operating system device manager utility.\nSelect the file to record the results and start the program.\nSelect the motors and frequencies to be activated by selecting from the dropdown menus for each motor in the \"Experiment_1.vi\" interface. Have the participant press the push-button with the leg on which the feedback is applied when a vibration is felt. After the button has been pressed, confirm the response in the data acquisition software interface by noting that the clock has stopped counting, and reset the motors for the next trial by selecting the new set of frequencies from the dropdown menus.\nOnce the experiment is concluded, use the dropdown menus to return all motor frequencies to the zero position and select the \"Stop Program\" button to terminate the connection to the motor control board.\n4. Experiment 2: Distinguishing between Stimuli\nNote: This experiment can be conducted entirely independently from Experiment 1. A single motor or multiple motors can be used. The specific locations of the motors can vary depending on the application and research questions.\nConnect a second push-button to another USB port using a serial-USB connector.\nOpen the \"Experiment_2.vi\" data acquisition interface.",
    "Place the motors in the locations and configurations required for the specific research application. For example, place single motors on the thigh, midway between the greater trochanter and lateral femoral condyle (or the distal end of the limb for amputees), on each of the anterior, posterior, lateral, and medial surfaces of the thigh to examine the frequency sensitivity at each of these portions of the leg10,11.\nSpecify the serial ports for the microcontroller board and both push-buttons using the same procedure as Step 3.4. Be sure to note which push-button is assigned to each port.\nSelect the specific motors to be activated and the desired sequence of frequencies by clicking on the \"Motor\" icons in the software interface. For example, suppose three frequencies are being tested, such as 140 Hz, 180 Hz, and 220 Hz. A series of tests might be (1) 180 Hz followed by 140 Hz, (2) 220 Hz followed by 140 Hz, and (3) 180 Hz followed by 220 Hz.\nInput the delayed start time and stimulation duration. 1.5 sec is typical for both the delay and stimulation times.\nStart the program.\n\tNote: The after the delay specified in Step 4.6, the program will activate the motor(s) with the sequence of paired frequencies chosen in Step 4.5. For example, if 180 Hz vs. 220 Hz was selected in Step 4.5, the corresponding motor will first vibrate at 180 Hz for the specified duration before switching to 220 Hz.\nHave the participant press one of the two push-buttons to choose whether the second perceived frequency was higher or lower than the first. Responses will automatically be recorded by the program.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
