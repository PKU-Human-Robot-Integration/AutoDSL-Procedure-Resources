    "Ethics statement\nThe study protocol was approved by the Ethical Review Board of the University Medical School Tübingen, Germany. Participants gave written informed consent prior to inclusion, and complete disclosure of the study purpose was offered to all participants after completion of the study 17.\n1. Study Preparation\nPrepare the “drugs” used: fill similar looking, tasting and smelling capsules with a) ginger powder, and b) a “placebo powder” such as starch. The capsules should be prepared and stored in a numbered envelope by a third person to keep the experimenter blind to the condition.\nRandomly assign participant to one of the four study groups of the balanced placebo design as described above (Table 1).\nPreparations to assess outcome measures.\n\t\nPrepare a questionnaire to fill in symptom ratings of participant. Seven symptoms (vertigo, headache, nausea, urge to vomit, tiredness, sweating, stomach awareness) will be rated on a scale from 0 (no symptom) to 5 (maximal symptom) six times during the experiment.\nPrepare a table to fill in rotation times and the number of head movements during five runs of the rotation procedure, and use a stopwatch to assess rotation times.\nPrepare the equipment for recording the EGG: three cutaneous electrodes, EGG device with Fetrode technology (active electrodes).\n2. Preparing Participants\nPrepare the EGG recordings.\n\t\nPlace three cutaneous electrodes on the skin above the stomach of the participant as described by Miller and Muth (2004) 24. Place the first electrode on the lower third of the midline between the umbilicus and sternum. Place the second electrode in a 45° angle upwards from the first electrode but under the lowest rip on the left side. Place the third electrode (reference electrode) in a 45° angle downwards from the first electrode to the right side.",
    "Connect the electrodes to the EGG device and start the recording software.\nSeat the participant in the rotation chair and store the EGG device in a bag at the backside of the chair.\n3. Baseline Assessments and Drug Intake\nFirst baseline assessment before drug intake.\n\t\nRecord at least 15 min of EGG previous to any intervention. Instruct participant not to move, speak or take deep breaths during this period of time.\nDrug administration.\n\t\nAccording to group assignment, the participant takes the pills (drug or placebo) without receiving any information about their content.\nSecond baseline assessment after drug intake.\n\t\nRecord at least 15 min of EGG after drug intake. Instruct participant not to move, speak or take deep breaths during this period of time.\nAfterwards, ask participant for seven symptoms of motion sickness (see above) on a scale between 0 (not symptom) to 5 (severe symptom).\nOptional: Depending on the assumed time until onset of action of the tested drug, perform further baseline assessments as described above.\n4. Inform Participant about Group Assignment\nImmediately before the rotation procedure, inform the participant about his/her group assignment according to the balanced placebo design, i.e. if he/she received the real drug or the placebo.\n\tNOTE: The participant receives this information in a closed envelope to keep the experimenter blind to the condition.\n5. Rotation Procedure\nGive instructions to the participant.\n\t\nThe rotation procedure consists of 5 runs, each with 2 min of rotation at a constant speed of 120 degrees/sec (20 rounds per min) and a 1 min break in-between the runs.\nThe participant will wear an eye mask and earphones and hear a beep every 10 sec. During rotations, the participant is instructed to move his/her head up and down when he/she hear the beep tone from the earphones.",
    "Participants should not vomit during the procedure and can skip head movements or tell the experimenter to stop the rotation in time if they strongly feel an urge to vomit. They are encouraged to proceed with the next run until all 5 runs have at least been started. However, the runs can be interrupted immediately, or the entire procedure can be stopped if necessary.\nDuring the breaks in-between the runs and after the last run, participants will be asked to rate seven symptoms of motion sickness on a scale from 0 (no symptom) to 5 (maximal symptom).\nStart the rotation procedure.\nDuring the rotation procedure, note the actually done head movements and the rotation time of each run.\nDuring the breaks and after the last run, ask the participant to rate symptoms and note the rating on the questionnaire.\n6. Post Assessments\nAfter the last run has finished and the subjective symptoms have been rated, record another 15 min of EGG during which participants should not move, speak, or take deep breaths.\n7. Calculate Outcome Variables\nCalculate subjective symptom ratings by adding the scores of each symptom for each of the six time points (at baseline and after each run) separately. Take the highest symptom rating during the rotation procedure and subtract the baseline symptom rating to get the final maximum symptom rating during the rotation procedure (SR).\n\tNOTE: Choosing the maximum symptom score as an outcome measure provides the advantage that in can also be used for participants who cannot tolerate the entire procedure - in contrast to the calculation of a sum or a mean value that are influenced by the number of runs tolerated.\nAdd up rotation times for the total rotation tolerance in seconds (RT).",
    "Add the number of head movements during the rotation procedure for the total number of head movements (HM).\n8. Analyze EGG Data\nVisually screen the raw EGG data for artifacts and select at least 5 min of artifact-free recording during the recording periods. As a rule of thumb, artifacts are defined as signals with fast and sudden onset and signals stronger than +/- 1,000 μV because such signals are improbable gastric myoelectrical activities.\nUse a Fast Fourier Transformation software to analyze the frequency domain of the EGG signal. As definition, signals between 2.5 and 3.75 cpm are regarded as normal gastric activity (normogastria) and between 4.0 and 9.75 cpm are regarded as tachygastria.\nCalculate the percentage spectral power of the normogastria and tachygastria bands from the total range of 0.75 to 15.0 cpm 23, and compute the ratio between the percentage of the normogastria and the tachygastria band (EGG ratio). A shift towards tachygastria (i.e., the ratio decreases) has repeatedly been associated with nausea in motion sickness induced by rotation chair or vection drum 19,23,24."
