    "Purification of acetylated α-synucleinHere we briefly describe how we purify our acetylated α-synuclein, as described in Wördehoff et al., 2017. As this protocol focusses on the aggregation of α-synuclein monitored by Thioflavin T fluorescence, the purification is described as concisely as possible.We coexpress codon-optimized α-synuclein in the pT7-7 vector together with the vector pNatB containing the N-terminal acetylation enzyme NatB from Schizosaccharomyzes pombe as described by Johnson et al., 2010.Expression is conducted in E. coli BL21DE3 grown in 2YT medium supplemented with 50 mM K/Na-phosphate buffer pH 7.2, 2 mM MgSO4 and 0.4% glycerol (v/v), with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol as selection markers. We inoculate the (pre-)culture from a glycerol stock that has been prepared by overnight growth of a single colony in 2YT medium, mixed with 50% glycerol (sterile) and stored at -80 °C.After pregrowth to OD600 of 1-1.2, expression is induced by addition of 1 mM Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and incubated while shaking at 120 rpm for 4 h at 37 °C. We routinely prepare 500 ml culture, which gives us a final expression yield of ~25 mg acetylated α-synuclein.Cells are harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.An individual cell pellet (from 500 ml culture) is resuspended in 15 ml of pure H2O and frozen at -20 °C in 50 ml Falcon tubes.The Falcon tubes with the frozen cell suspension are transferred to a heat block preheated to 98 °C and incubated for 30 min to both lyse the cells and precipitate proteins by heat denaturation. α-Synuclein is thermostable and remains soluble.Cell lysate is cooled down on ice for 10 min, afterward cell debris and precipitated proteins are pelleted at 15,000 x g and 4 °C for 30 min.The supernatant is then filtered through a 0.",
    "2 μm filter into a new 50 ml tube.Saturated ammonium sulfate solution (~4.3 M at room temperature) is added in 1-ml steps to the supernatant to 50% saturation (1:1) while stirring on a magnetic stirrer, thereby precipitating α-synuclein, nucleic acids largely remain soluble.The turbid solution is then incubated on ice for 20 min and pelleted at 15,000 x g and 4 °C for 30 min.Supernatant is discarded and the pellet is resuspended in 50 ml of IEC buffer A (optional: dissolve in 5 ml IEC buffer A and dialyzed overnight against 1 L of IEC buffer A).The solution is then loaded onto a 5 ml HiTrap Q HP ion exchange chromatography column (GE Healthcare) connected to an ÄKTA purifier system (GE Healthcare), equilibrated in IEC buffer A.α-Synuclein elutes at around 250 mM NaCl on a 0-500 mM NaCl gradient to IEC buffer B, run over 100 ml at 2.5 ml/min.Fractions containing α-synuclein are combined, again precipitated by ammonium sulfate and pelleted as described above.The pellet is resuspended in 4 ml SEC buffer and finally purified in two runs by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a Superdex 75 16/60 column (120 ml column volume, GE Healthcare) at 1 ml/min in SEC buffer.After SEC, α-synuclein is sterile-filtered through a 0.2 μm filter and the concentration is measured on a spectrophotometer, using and extinction coefficient of 5,600 M-1 cm-1 at 275 nm.α-Synuclein is aliquoted, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C.General preparationPrepare stock solutions: 1 mM Thioflavin T in H2O, 10% (w/v) sodium azide in H2O. We use Thioflavin T solutions for a year; sodium azide solution is prepared fresh every month (both stored in the fridge at 4-8 °C).Buffers and protein solutions should be filter sterilized.",
    "As α-synuclein is sensitive to degradation, aliquots of α-synuclein should be stored at -80 °C and defrosted just before the assay.Calculate the amounts of reagents to pipette. For triplicate measurements, 400 μl sample per condition is needed (3x 120 μl, 40 μl reserve). In order to avoid that the ThT fluorescence saturates before the equilibrium of fibril formation is reached, a sufficiently high ThT concentration on the order of the applied protein concentration should be used. We typically use 10-20 μM ThT and 0.05% sodium azide (final concentrations).Include a negative control, which consists of buffer, salts, Thioflavin T and sodium azide.Preheat your plate reader to 37 °C. Aggregation assays can be performed at different temperatures, e.g., between 20 °C and 37 °C. However, we routinely use 37 °C as it is the human body temperature and α-synuclein aggregation is quite slow at lower temperatures.Prepare the plate: with sterile tweezers, take out as many glass beads as you need (out of the 70% ethanol solution), dry them shortly on a lint-less cloth and transfer them into the wells–choose glass beads of homogenous size. As the glass beads we use are slightly heterogeneous in terms of size and shape, we sort out glass beads with a small and large diameter, as well as glass beads that are not spherical by visual inspection. In general, the addition of glass beads is crucial to speed up aggregation and increase reproducibility of triplicates.We always leave the outer wells of the plate empty; they can give unexpected readings, so first well to use is B2, last well is G11.Optional: Pipette 120 μl water into the spaces between the wells and idle wells–this can be done to minimize possible evaporation from the sample wells.Prepare and label a sufficient amount of 1.",
    "5 ml protein low-bind reaction tubes and transfer tubes onto ice, do the subsequent pipetting steps on ice.Sample preparationPipette the reagents, starting with the buffer, then sodium azide, Thioflavin T and lastly the protein solution into the 1.5 ml reaction tubes. As an example, this is the pipetting scheme for 400 μl of the 50 μM α-synuclein sample shown in Figure 1, assuming stock concentrations of 200 μM for α-synuclein, 1 mM Thioflavin T, and 10% sodium azide:294 μl of SEC buffer2 μl of 10% sodium azide4 μl of 1 mM Thioflavin T100 μl of α-synuclein (in SEC buffer) Shortly (1 sec) vortex the samples to mix them and put them back on ice.Distribute 120 μl of sample per well.Seal plate with the sealing tape and transfer it to the plate reader.Plate reader settingsWe use a fluorescence plate reader (FLUOstar Omega by BMG LABTECH), assay temperature: 37 °C.Basic parameters: Microplate: Greiner 96 half area; Excitation filter: 448-10; Emission filter: 482-10; Gain: 750; Orbital Averaging–On: 3 mm, Bottom Optic, Settling time: 1 sec; Kinetic Window: 1,000 cycles, 12 flashes per well and cycle, cycle time: 900 sec.Layout: Mark the distribution of your samples.Shaking options: Orbital, 400 rpm, 30 sec before each cycle. Shaking is crucial to speed up aggregation and improve reproducibility of triplicates.Samples are run until fluorescence plateaus are reached.See also the appendix[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20180711/2941 Supplementary file Appendix.docx] for the plate reader settings."
